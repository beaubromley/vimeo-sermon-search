00:00:00.085 --> 00:00:02.805
Testament text in the world

2
00:00:04.145 --> 00:00:05.685
is in Manchester.

3
00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:09.325
It is a passage of the Gospel of John,

4
00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.965
and it was, they dated to about 120 80.

5
00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.445
So let's say John died in nine 80,

6
00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:18.925
some people think he died in a hundred.

7
00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:25.005
So 20 years later, we have the text of what John wrote.

8
00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:28.485
And so you're going to hear people say,

9
00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:29.805
will the bundles change?

10
00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:33.325
And people have changed it. Just say, go to Manchester.

11
00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:36.525
People make sense? Okay.

12
00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:38.165
I don't know what I told you all that.

13
00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:43.085
Um, okay, so what are some reasons

14
00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:47.405
we can trust the canon page?

15
00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:48.965
What is that? Page five?

16
00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:52.645
What are some reasons we can trust the canon?

17
00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:58.925
Well, the Bible says we can trust the king.

18
00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:03.645
Anything wrong with that?

19
00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:10.485
What? Self. Self-referential. Self-referential.

20
00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:12.165
It might be called circular object.

21
00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:16.845
So I can say to you, uh, give me a thousand dollars

22
00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:18.965
and I'll give it back to you tomorrow.

23
00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:20.885
I myself said, so

24
00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:23.565
Almost A thousand dollars.

25
00:01:26.155 --> 00:01:29.645
Okay, so what's wrong with that? Or what's right with it?

26
00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:36.485
If enough People say it,

27
00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:39.085
The preponderance of the evidence

28
00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:41.645
of saying the same thing.

29
00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:46.285
Okay. So one thing we can do is look at the historicity

30
00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:50.605
of people over the last, you know, what is it?

31
00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:52.845
How many thousands of years?

32
00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:57.125
Uh, going back at least four, uh, 2,500 years,

33
00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:01.685
and how that's worked out for them, right?

34
00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:06.405
Uh, and that is one thing the Bible says is pass it down

35
00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:08.405
to your children and your children's children.

36
00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:14.005
Uh, because, uh, it is true. It is, it, it works.
