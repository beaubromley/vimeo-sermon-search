WEBVTT

1
00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:20.405
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:23.805
Uh, it's great to see you, uh, what a week it's been, right?

3
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:25.405
Like, uh, it's hard

4
00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:27.805
to get motivated when it's zero degrees outside.

5
00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:30.445
So I'm glad it's gonna be 65 today.

6
00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:32.845
I'm glad we're here together as well.

7
00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:35.045
Also, I'm really glad and thankful, uh,

8
00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:38.925
for criss cross jumping in last Sunday, doing a great job

9
00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:41.485
with the series in one Samuel.

10
00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:43.045
So we're gonna keep going in that today.

11
00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:46.965
So take your copy of God's word, turn with me to chapter 23

12
00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:50.845
of one Samuel one, Samuel 23 is

13
00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:52.085
where we're gonna continue today.

14
00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.685
So where I was last weekend, I was on a ski trip

15
00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:59.845
with my oldest son, uh, 16-year-old on Christmas Eve.

16
00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:02.725
And so, uh, just like I did, if you remember years ago,

17
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.445
I did those 10 trips with our sons, the big trips.

18
00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.765
And so I'm gonna do a, a 16 trip with each of them

19
00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:09.685
as well just to go skiing together.

20
00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:11.125
Uh, well, lemme just tell

21
00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:12.085
you a little bit about what happened.

22
00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.565
One, one day at the top of the lift,

23
00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:14.605
we're getting off the lift

24
00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:17.325
and there's a big group of people kind of gathered

25
00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:19.645
around one of the ski patrol members

26
00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:24.645
and that ski patrol guy was showing them how to, uh, like

27
00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:26.685
what to do if you get stranded basically.

28
00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:30.325
And so, uh, he was showing them how to dig like a, a,

29
00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:33.725
an igloo out of the side of a snowbank.

30
00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:36.885
So if you're back country skiing and you get lost

31
00:01:36.945 --> 00:01:38.565
and stranded, how to stay warm, right?

32
00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:42.245
So you dig this hole in there and, and it has a, a vent

33
00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:44.125
and you keep your body heat inside.

34
00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.165
It actually can stay pretty warm, supposedly.

35
00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:48.085
I don't wanna try that, but it, it can do that.

36
00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:51.005
And so that was what he was showing them to do.

37
00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:52.965
Now again, I'm never gonna ski in a place

38
00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:54.645
that I'll actually need, that they've caught

39
00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:55.685
an avalanche or anything.

40
00:01:56.065 --> 00:02:00.405
I'm not gonna do that. But if, if I was in that situation

41
00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:05.125
or if someone is in that situation, that place in a time

42
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.685
of trouble would be a refuge, right?

43
00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:09.005
It would be a place that they would find shelter

44
00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:11.565
in their time of need.

45
00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:15.135
Well, we've observed recently in one Samuel

46
00:02:15.205 --> 00:02:18.015
that David has needed a refuge

47
00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:20.735
as King Saul has come

48
00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:24.255
after him trying to take his life jealously.

49
00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:27.415
David needed a refuge.

50
00:02:28.755 --> 00:02:31.655
In fact, he needed not just a refuge, he needed a deliverer.

51
00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:34.455
He needed someone to save him.

52
00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:40.495
Well, what we're gonna see today is God's providence in

53
00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:43.775
and over David's life, meaning

54
00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:47.095
God's sovereign control of events

55
00:02:47.195 --> 00:02:49.855
and people to bring about his purposes.

56
00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:53.895
But we're also gonna see not only God's providence,

57
00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:58.775
we're gonna see God's deliverance in David's life in order

58
00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:02.565
to continue God's purpose through

59
00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:06.625
and in David, which will point us to

60
00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:10.945
that same God in our lives when we face

61
00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.225
similar circumstances.

62
00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:16.705
So let's pray. First, let's ask God to teach us what we need

63
00:03:16.765 --> 00:03:18.505
to learn in this passage.

64
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.505
So Father God, we do come to you humbly.

65
00:03:24.215 --> 00:03:28.065
What a miracle that we can even do this right now,

66
00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:33.575
that by your grace, the God of the universe, God almighty,

67
00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:37.415
you allow us to just come right into your presence like

68
00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:39.535
this, to speak to you

69
00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:42.335
as if you're sitting across the table from us.

70
00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:45.775
God, what a gift privilege that is.

71
00:03:47.075 --> 00:03:50.815
And you've given us your word to tell us about yourself.

72
00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:53.175
And so, Lord, we pray you'd show us today something

73
00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:57.495
from your word about who you are, what you have done,

74
00:03:57.805 --> 00:04:00.295
what you will do, that we can be impacted

75
00:04:00.395 --> 00:04:02.615
and changed forever because of it.

76
00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:07.115
We need you to do that. God, we can't do that ourselves.

77
00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:11.595
And so we trust you will give us eyes to see it.

78
00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:16.595
Give us a heart ready to receive it. In Jesus' name. Amen.

79
00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:21.475
So as we've progressed through the book of Samuel, uh,

80
00:04:21.475 --> 00:04:24.675
first Samuel, you can see that this has been a journey right

81
00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:27.595
as we've moved from Samuel to Saul, to now David.

82
00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:30.195
And this shift is happening from Saul to David.

83
00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:31.875
As as God's moving

84
00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:34.515
and the people are beginning to popularize David

85
00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:37.235
and Saul's losing credibility, all of that's happening.

86
00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:39.395
Uh, we saw the, the only remaining

87
00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:40.515
priest aligned with David.

88
00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.315
So Saul has lost all of that.

89
00:04:42.965 --> 00:04:45.075
We've also learned that David's trying

90
00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:47.315
to grow in his ability to seek the Lord

91
00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:49.275
and trust the Lord in all circumstances.

92
00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:51.915
Through the trials, all the persecution,

93
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.355
God is bringing David closer to himself.

94
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:57.715
Well, at this point now in the narrative,

95
00:04:57.745 --> 00:05:00.595
David's back in Judah, he's actually not far from

96
00:05:00.595 --> 00:05:01.755
where Saul was.

97
00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:07.035
And so what we're now learning as we go forward here is

98
00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:09.635
that the tension is being heightened.

99
00:05:10.775 --> 00:05:12.755
And we've seen this interaction, David and Saul

100
00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:14.235
before many times now.

101
00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:16.235
But the tension is heightening

102
00:05:16.975 --> 00:05:19.195
as things are getting further down the road.

103
00:05:19.215 --> 00:05:21.155
And so we're gonna read the whole section here,

104
00:05:21.995 --> 00:05:26.315
starting in verse 15, chapter 23, verse 15 through verse 29,

105
00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:29.635
and going to give the whole picture.

106
00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:35.345
And so David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life.

107
00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:38.625
David was in the wilderness as if at Horsch.

108
00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:42.185
And Jonathan Saul's son rose and went to David at Horsch

109
00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:44.105
and strengthened his hand in God.

110
00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:48.665
Jonathan said to him, do not fear for the hand of Saul.

111
00:05:48.665 --> 00:05:52.315
My father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel.

112
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:55.635
I shall be next to you Saul. My father also knows this.

113
00:05:56.335 --> 00:05:58.245
And the two of them made a covenant before the Lord.

114
00:05:58.455 --> 00:06:01.205
David remained at hoes and Jonathan went home.

115
00:06:02.315 --> 00:06:04.485
Then the Z fights, remember that's where David was.

116
00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:07.005
The Z fights went up to Saul at GIAs saying,

117
00:06:07.195 --> 00:06:09.445
it's not David hiding among us in the strongholds

118
00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:13.285
of Horsch on the hill of Haah, which is south of Jmo.

119
00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:16.085
Now come down O King according

120
00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:17.685
to all your heart's desire to come down.

121
00:06:17.705 --> 00:06:20.925
And our part shall be to surrender David into your hand.

122
00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:24.365
And Saul said, may you be blessed by the Lord,

123
00:06:24.465 --> 00:06:26.045
for you've had compassion on me.

124
00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:28.845
Go make yet more sure know

125
00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:30.405
and see the place where his foot is.

126
00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:32.925
See, uh, who has seen him there for?

127
00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:34.645
It's told me that he's very cunning.

128
00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:36.845
See therefore take note

129
00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:39.005
of all the lurking places where he hides.

130
00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:40.885
Come back to me with sure information,

131
00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:42.525
then I will go with you.

132
00:06:42.945 --> 00:06:44.525
If he's in the land, I'll search him out

133
00:06:44.525 --> 00:06:46.085
among all the thousands of Judah.

134
00:06:46.855 --> 00:06:48.675
And they arose and went to Ziff ahead of Saul.

135
00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:50.875
Now David and his men were in the wilderness

136
00:06:50.975 --> 00:06:54.195
of May in the ABA to the south of YesOn.

137
00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:57.795
And Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told.

138
00:06:57.935 --> 00:06:59.835
So he went down to the rock,

139
00:07:00.165 --> 00:07:01.915
lived in the wilderness of Mayon.

140
00:07:02.425 --> 00:07:04.235
When Saul heard that he pursued

141
00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:06.275
after David in the wilderness of Mayon,

142
00:07:07.145 --> 00:07:09.035
Saul went on one side of the mountain, David

143
00:07:09.055 --> 00:07:10.995
and his men on the other side of the mountain.

144
00:07:11.855 --> 00:07:14.155
And David was hurrying to get away from Saul.

145
00:07:15.255 --> 00:07:17.235
As Saul and his men were closing in on David

146
00:07:17.295 --> 00:07:18.595
and his men to capture them.

147
00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:21.835
A messenger came to Saul saying, hurry come.

148
00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:24.755
The Philistines have made a raid against the land.

149
00:07:25.655 --> 00:07:28.075
So Saul returned from pursuing after David

150
00:07:28.135 --> 00:07:29.715
and win against the Philistines.

151
00:07:30.505 --> 00:07:33.835
Therefore, that place was called the Rock of Escape.

152
00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:36.255
And David went up from there,

153
00:07:36.545 --> 00:07:38.695
lived in the strongholds of in gti.

154
00:07:40.575 --> 00:07:41.875
Now, if you were here last week

155
00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:45.675
or you caught up online, this passage, this back half

156
00:07:45.675 --> 00:07:49.715
of chapter 23 is structured very similarly to the first half

157
00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:52.035
that Chris talked about last week.

158
00:07:52.335 --> 00:07:54.395
In fact, it's merely the same concepts.

159
00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:57.475
It just expands on them a little more deeply.

160
00:07:58.735 --> 00:08:01.835
And David did get delivered in the first section from

161
00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:03.355
Saul's uh, efforts.

162
00:08:03.655 --> 00:08:06.315
But here in this section, we not only see the deliverance,

163
00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:10.395
we see the reasons behind the deliverance, the big, why

164
00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:14.795
did God deliver David and even how in many ways.

165
00:08:15.255 --> 00:08:17.035
So we'll uncover that as we work through the passage.

166
00:08:17.215 --> 00:08:21.635
But first we saw in verses 15 through 18 that God used

167
00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:24.355
Jonathan to deliver David in this scene.

168
00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:28.235
First God used Jonathan, the same Jonathan

169
00:08:28.465 --> 00:08:29.995
that was Saul's son, right?

170
00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:31.755
Who had aligned with David.

171
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:35.955
Now God used Jonathan to deliver David,

172
00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:39.995
but what did Jonathan deliver David from?

173
00:08:40.545 --> 00:08:42.435
Because in their scene they're back and forth.

174
00:08:42.435 --> 00:08:43.875
There's no battle there. There's no like

175
00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:45.515
near death experience.

176
00:08:45.655 --> 00:08:47.115
So what happened here?

177
00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:50.155
Why did I say that Jonathan delivered David?

178
00:08:51.185 --> 00:08:52.915
Well, he delivered David from fear.

179
00:08:54.715 --> 00:08:57.525
God used Jonathan to deliver David from fear.

180
00:08:59.055 --> 00:09:01.495
'cause you can imagine that David would've been tempted

181
00:09:01.495 --> 00:09:03.135
to be quite afraid, right?

182
00:09:04.325 --> 00:09:06.975
He's faced with all of this, this king

183
00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:11.045
who's putting all his resources into killing you.

184
00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:13.365
Like that. That's a terrifying thing.

185
00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:16.795
He would have reason to be afraid.

186
00:09:16.935 --> 00:09:19.395
And you can go read the Psalms that David wrote

187
00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:23.795
around these scenes and you, you see real fear in his life.

188
00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:26.745
All these threats. We even saw it in

189
00:09:26.745 --> 00:09:27.785
the way David acted at times.

190
00:09:28.105 --> 00:09:30.945
Remember he was, he was trusting his own cunningness rather

191
00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.425
than trusting God.

192
00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:35.345
He was trying to manipulate situations 'cause he was afraid.

193
00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:40.935
Even Jonathan's words here in verse 17, he comes to David,

194
00:09:41.035 --> 00:09:43.095
the first thing he says, do not fear

195
00:09:44.635 --> 00:09:45.995
'cause he knew David would've been afraid.

196
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.005
But Jonathan came with a goal.

197
00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:52.765
Verse 16 says, Jonathan's goal was to strengthen

198
00:09:53.555 --> 00:09:55.085
David's hand in God.

199
00:09:56.425 --> 00:09:59.315
What that means is to encourage him, stay confident,

200
00:09:59.345 --> 00:10:02.235
stay steadfast, encourage him to keep going

201
00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:04.715
in this towards the Lord.

202
00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:07.035
He knew David needed that.

203
00:10:07.095 --> 00:10:09.075
Now, it's not the first time something like this

204
00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:10.675
is said in the Bible.

205
00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.395
The prophet Isaiah said something very similar

206
00:10:14.695 --> 00:10:15.715
to God's people.

207
00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:20.115
In Isaiah 35, those who were waiting on God to return,

208
00:10:20.145 --> 00:10:21.915
they felt like things were falling apart.

209
00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:26.355
Isaiah 35, here's what it says. Strengthen the weak hands.

210
00:10:26.785 --> 00:10:28.635
Make firm the feeble knees.

211
00:10:29.615 --> 00:10:31.635
Say to those who have an anxious heart.

212
00:10:32.175 --> 00:10:36.715
Be strong fear, not behold your God will come

213
00:10:36.745 --> 00:10:39.275
with vengeance, with the recompense of God.

214
00:10:39.375 --> 00:10:44.035
He will come and save you. Is that not what David needed?

215
00:10:45.135 --> 00:10:46.595
He needed someone to strengthen him.

216
00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:50.115
He needed to be reminded that God was going

217
00:10:50.115 --> 00:10:52.515
to win this battle, that God was actually working

218
00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:53.835
in this moment.

219
00:10:55.575 --> 00:10:58.555
And so God used Jonathan to deliver David from fear.

220
00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:02.645
But notice how he did it. How did Jonathan do it?

221
00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:04.565
He did it through identity.

222
00:11:07.555 --> 00:11:10.055
God used Jonathan to deliver David from fear

223
00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:11.615
through identity.

224
00:11:14.585 --> 00:11:17.555
Look again at one Samuel 23 verse 17.

225
00:11:19.065 --> 00:11:20.595
This is what Jonathan said to David.

226
00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:24.555
He said, do not fear for the hand of Saul.

227
00:11:24.655 --> 00:11:29.555
My father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel.

228
00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:35.255
I shall be next to you Saul, my father even knows this.

229
00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.315
In other words, Jonathan looks at David

230
00:11:41.165 --> 00:11:42.915
who's in this tough spot, terrified.

231
00:11:43.255 --> 00:11:44.315
He looks at David and he says,

232
00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:45.995
Hey David, remember who you are.

233
00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:50.955
Remember who God anointed you to be.

234
00:11:51.595 --> 00:11:52.635
Remember who God is,

235
00:11:52.855 --> 00:11:55.125
but don't forget that strong He God is strong enough

236
00:11:55.185 --> 00:11:57.805
to protect you to accomplish this plan.

237
00:11:57.945 --> 00:12:00.205
He told you it's gonna happen. Trust him.

238
00:12:00.805 --> 00:12:04.935
Remember who he said you're going to be like He.

239
00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:08.735
He reminded David of the identity that God had given him.

240
00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:16.445
Everyone else knew it. Even King Saul himself knew

241
00:12:16.515 --> 00:12:18.405
that David was anointed as the next king.

242
00:12:18.695 --> 00:12:21.525
David could have very easily been forgetting that

243
00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:25.365
he's in the moments of death facing him

244
00:12:25.365 --> 00:12:27.565
and he's getting spears thrown at him.

245
00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:28.805
He's hiding in the wilderness.

246
00:12:28.805 --> 00:12:30.285
He's like, did God, are you sure?

247
00:12:30.595 --> 00:12:33.645
Like, is this really gonna work out? I'm not totally sure.

248
00:12:33.645 --> 00:12:34.765
This looks like it will.

249
00:12:36.185 --> 00:12:38.685
So David needed to be reminded

250
00:12:39.105 --> 00:12:44.055
of those truths he needed to be reminded.

251
00:12:45.985 --> 00:12:47.285
So let's just think about this for a second.

252
00:12:48.305 --> 00:12:51.495
You see any parallels to our lives?

253
00:12:54.205 --> 00:12:57.505
You, you see how this could maybe relate

254
00:12:57.885 --> 00:12:59.185
to our situation at all.

255
00:13:02.025 --> 00:13:05.855
You and I are so prone to this where we as

256
00:13:06.545 --> 00:13:10.945
Christians, instead of remembering who we are in Christ,

257
00:13:12.795 --> 00:13:16.265
we're so prone to re just rest in the lies

258
00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:21.065
or be swayed by the circumstances instead of remembering

259
00:13:21.065 --> 00:13:22.665
who we are in Christ.

260
00:13:25.995 --> 00:13:27.515
I mean, just think about how this works out, right?

261
00:13:27.575 --> 00:13:30.155
You, you compare your financial situation

262
00:13:30.455 --> 00:13:32.115
to someone else who's just one rung

263
00:13:32.205 --> 00:13:33.435
above you on that ladder.

264
00:13:34.135 --> 00:13:36.955
And then you start to somehow question that God is,

265
00:13:36.975 --> 00:13:38.395
are you really providing for me

266
00:13:39.615 --> 00:13:42.875
when you're fine, see how that works?

267
00:13:43.935 --> 00:13:46.275
God, are you really the provider? God, am I really yours?

268
00:13:46.295 --> 00:13:47.755
Are you really caring for me?

269
00:13:48.185 --> 00:13:49.235
This is how it works out for me.

270
00:13:49.235 --> 00:13:52.635
Someone criticizes me in, in my position and,

271
00:13:52.635 --> 00:13:54.075
and I can easily begin to think

272
00:13:54.075 --> 00:13:55.755
that I am actually pretty worthless.

273
00:13:59.475 --> 00:14:04.375
Or you struggle with past sins and,

274
00:14:04.375 --> 00:14:06.615
and you're doubting your forgiveness.

275
00:14:07.715 --> 00:14:08.735
It just comes back up.

276
00:14:08.735 --> 00:14:10.095
You're like, man, am I really forgiven for that?

277
00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.415
It just feels like I'm not.

278
00:14:11.595 --> 00:14:13.815
And what that does is just gives the enemy a chance

279
00:14:13.875 --> 00:14:17.135
to keep condemnation on your shoulders over and over again.

280
00:14:21.165 --> 00:14:24.785
Or someone mocks the decisions you've made

281
00:14:24.805 --> 00:14:25.865
to live a holy life.

282
00:14:28.815 --> 00:14:30.895
'cause you'd say, I can't live the world the way the world,

283
00:14:30.955 --> 00:14:32.575
I'm gonna try to live God's way.

284
00:14:32.595 --> 00:14:33.775
And, and somebody mocks that.

285
00:14:33.795 --> 00:14:36.815
And so in your heart, you start to compromise a little bit

286
00:14:36.995 --> 00:14:40.295
to try not to look as foolish to the world.

287
00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:48.515
All of that and so much more is why you

288
00:14:48.515 --> 00:14:52.045
and I need to regularly be reminded of who we

289
00:14:52.065 --> 00:14:53.065
Are in Christ.

290
00:14:55.735 --> 00:14:57.435
See you. You'll hear us talk about it.

291
00:14:57.615 --> 00:14:59.915
Almost every church you are ever a part

292
00:14:59.915 --> 00:15:01.995
of will talk about the importance

293
00:15:02.055 --> 00:15:05.395
of things like studying God's word, praying, getting

294
00:15:05.545 --> 00:15:08.515
with your church family, worshiping together, small groups,

295
00:15:09.045 --> 00:15:10.715
godly friends, all of that.

296
00:15:11.055 --> 00:15:12.075
Why do we talk about that?

297
00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:14.755
I is it just because we are legalistic

298
00:15:14.755 --> 00:15:16.035
and we want you to do certain things

299
00:15:16.055 --> 00:15:17.395
or control you in certain ways?

300
00:15:17.815 --> 00:15:20.955
No, it's because those things are what remind you

301
00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:22.515
of your identity in Christ.

302
00:15:24.535 --> 00:15:26.735
I It's not to control. It's like we want better for you.

303
00:15:26.935 --> 00:15:30.735
I I need those things in my life. I need God's word.

304
00:15:30.975 --> 00:15:34.135
I need to pray. I need people like you to remind me of

305
00:15:34.135 --> 00:15:36.175
who I am whenever I start to question it.

306
00:15:37.525 --> 00:15:39.455
Because it's so easy to forget that.

307
00:15:39.645 --> 00:15:41.055
It's so easy to doubt that.

308
00:15:43.595 --> 00:15:45.055
And listen, when I'm talking identity here,

309
00:15:45.055 --> 00:15:47.095
when we say this identity thing, I'm not talking about

310
00:15:47.095 --> 00:15:50.815
what you do, even

311
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.095
David in a sense, right?

312
00:15:52.095 --> 00:15:54.895
Like I, I am a doctor or I am a teacher.

313
00:15:55.235 --> 00:15:59.105
No, that's what you do. It's not who you are.

314
00:16:01.885 --> 00:16:03.555
Those things can easily change, right?

315
00:16:03.555 --> 00:16:06.355
Like you, you can grow up and get a degree in this and

316
00:16:06.415 --> 00:16:07.875
and work something completely different.

317
00:16:08.415 --> 00:16:10.035
You can be this for 12 years

318
00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:11.435
and then all of a sudden you change, do something else.

319
00:16:11.435 --> 00:16:14.395
That's not who you are, right? That's what you do.

320
00:16:14.775 --> 00:16:18.715
Who you are is that unchangeable part of you.

321
00:16:19.055 --> 00:16:21.515
And predominantly what we're talking about in

322
00:16:21.515 --> 00:16:25.635
that if you're a Christian, your identity is child of God.

323
00:16:27.385 --> 00:16:30.445
That's Unchangeable, right?

324
00:16:30.445 --> 00:16:33.365
That doesn't matter what you're doing, what you do

325
00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:36.125
for a vocation or hobby or what, it's who you

326
00:16:36.265 --> 00:16:37.265
Are.

327
00:16:38.555 --> 00:16:39.855
And so hear me if that's you,

328
00:16:41.645 --> 00:16:43.505
if you've trusted in the life, death,

329
00:16:43.525 --> 00:16:46.145
and resurrection of Jesus in your place,

330
00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:49.605
Then Let me just remind you for a second who you are.

331
00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:55.715
Let me remind you of what God says about you.

332
00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:56.995
And, and I don't know this,

333
00:16:56.995 --> 00:16:58.755
this came really late in the week.

334
00:16:58.815 --> 00:17:02.035
So I, I'm assuming God led this to happen

335
00:17:02.145 --> 00:17:04.635
because somebody in this room needs to hear

336
00:17:04.635 --> 00:17:05.635
What I'm about to say.

337
00:17:08.675 --> 00:17:13.025
I needed to hear this. Lemme remind you of who

338
00:17:13.225 --> 00:17:14.225
You are a Christian.

339
00:17:16.355 --> 00:17:20.365
Just listen carefully. Let this soak into your soul.

340
00:17:23.825 --> 00:17:26.205
You Are a saint made holy

341
00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:31.185
By Christ's blood. You are blessed

342
00:17:31.775 --> 00:17:34.025
Because of God's presence in your life.

343
00:17:36.925 --> 00:17:41.665
God takes delight in you even singing over

344
00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:42.685
You.

345
00:17:45.185 --> 00:17:46.605
You are saved forever.

346
00:17:47.385 --> 00:17:50.285
Not by any work you could ever do in your life,

347
00:17:50.705 --> 00:17:52.565
but by Christ work for you.

348
00:17:55.085 --> 00:17:58.465
You are reconciled with the God of the universe.

349
00:18:01.055 --> 00:18:03.315
You will experience trouble in this life,

350
00:18:03.495 --> 00:18:05.795
but Christ has overcome that trouble for you.

351
00:18:08.425 --> 00:18:12.045
You have access to God all the time.

352
00:18:14.755 --> 00:18:17.855
You are gifted by God's spirit for his purpose.

353
00:18:20.305 --> 00:18:22.805
You are a new creation in Christ.

354
00:18:25.095 --> 00:18:26.355
You will sin yes,

355
00:18:26.615 --> 00:18:28.075
but you are fully forgiven

356
00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:29.875
underneath the perfect blood of Jesus.

357
00:18:30.095 --> 00:18:34.915
Us you're chosen

358
00:18:35.455 --> 00:18:38.075
and adopted into God's very family.

359
00:18:41.405 --> 00:18:42.665
You're not finished yet,

360
00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:46.995
but you are not what you used to be.

361
00:18:48.715 --> 00:18:51.495
And you are fully complete in Christ.

362
00:18:55.725 --> 00:19:00.345
In Christ. You have the victory over sin and death.

363
00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:07.665
You are loved far more than you can even imagine

364
00:19:11.915 --> 00:19:13.535
and so much more.

365
00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:17.455
I could keep going for days and talk about that.

366
00:19:17.635 --> 00:19:21.415
But let me remind you if that's your identity,

367
00:19:22.485 --> 00:19:27.015
that means no criticism, no situation, no temptation,

368
00:19:27.675 --> 00:19:30.695
no lie can change any of that.

369
00:19:32.885 --> 00:19:35.895
Christian. That's who you are.

370
00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:41.835
Be reminded of that. That's your new identity in Christ.

371
00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.075
That's not like something you hope to be.

372
00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:45.755
That's what God's word says.

373
00:19:45.755 --> 00:19:50.175
That's what you are right now, No matter

374
00:19:50.175 --> 00:19:52.575
what anybody else says, no matter what your flesh says,

375
00:19:52.675 --> 00:19:54.895
no matter what the enemy of our souls says,

376
00:19:55.365 --> 00:19:59.215
that means you can live a no fear kind of life

377
00:19:59.215 --> 00:20:00.335
because of that identity.

378
00:20:01.955 --> 00:20:06.735
Romans 8 31, if God is for us who can be against us?

379
00:20:07.835 --> 00:20:12.015
No fear because that's who God says you are.

380
00:20:14.755 --> 00:20:16.075
I don't know who needed that. I did.

381
00:20:16.335 --> 00:20:20.935
So Jonathan

382
00:20:21.435 --> 00:20:24.015
was used by God to deliver David from the fear

383
00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:25.855
that was naturally coming in his life

384
00:20:26.365 --> 00:20:27.735
because of his situation.

385
00:20:27.735 --> 00:20:31.455
There was fear, but God said through Jonathan, here's Ray,

386
00:20:31.855 --> 00:20:36.095
remember, don't forget you will be the king

387
00:20:36.095 --> 00:20:37.575
because you are mine.

388
00:20:39.725 --> 00:20:43.465
But here's the other thing. God used the Philistines

389
00:20:43.565 --> 00:20:44.865
to deliver David as well.

390
00:20:47.265 --> 00:20:50.325
So God used Jonathan to deliver David from fear,

391
00:20:50.465 --> 00:20:53.645
but God used the Philistines to deliver David.

392
00:20:53.665 --> 00:20:54.685
Now you're sitting there thinking like,

393
00:20:54.685 --> 00:20:55.765
wait, wait a second, hold up.

394
00:20:56.295 --> 00:20:57.605
Those are the enemy, right?

395
00:20:57.635 --> 00:20:59.325
Like that's the bad guys in the story.

396
00:20:59.395 --> 00:21:00.765
What is going on here?

397
00:21:00.835 --> 00:21:01.965
Well that's part of the point

398
00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:07.055
that God is fully in control of everything,

399
00:21:08.585 --> 00:21:10.355
even enemy armies.

400
00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:17.125
So what happened here? Someone ratted David out again

401
00:21:18.865 --> 00:21:20.515
told Saul where David was hiding.

402
00:21:20.575 --> 00:21:22.395
We don't know why. Maybe they were afraid of Saul

403
00:21:22.395 --> 00:21:24.195
and they wanted to get on his good side, I don't know.

404
00:21:26.005 --> 00:21:29.145
But they knew as Saul wanted to kill David.

405
00:21:30.885 --> 00:21:32.585
So they told Saul where David was.

406
00:21:35.715 --> 00:21:37.175
But this is an interesting piece.

407
00:21:37.515 --> 00:21:41.095
Did you notice the depth of Saul's depravity?

408
00:21:43.515 --> 00:21:44.925
Look at this verse 21.

409
00:21:49.255 --> 00:21:50.865
They told Saul where David was

410
00:21:50.925 --> 00:21:54.345
and Saul said, may you be blessed by the Lord

411
00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:58.655
for you have had compassion on me.

412
00:22:02.135 --> 00:22:05.425
Like he said, they showed him compassion by telling him

413
00:22:05.595 --> 00:22:07.705
where David was hiding so he could go kill him.

414
00:22:08.615 --> 00:22:12.705
Like Saul was still under this delusion that somehow

415
00:22:13.455 --> 00:22:17.265
he's following God's plan for the the nation of Israel.

416
00:22:17.265 --> 00:22:19.025
Like he was so far gone.

417
00:22:23.595 --> 00:22:25.245
Well, thankfully David figured it out.

418
00:22:26.145 --> 00:22:29.365
And so he went to hide even further in the wilderness and,

419
00:22:29.385 --> 00:22:31.485
and as Saul continued

420
00:22:31.565 --> 00:22:34.525
to pursue David even further in the wilderness, look again,

421
00:22:34.615 --> 00:22:36.325
verse 26 starting here.

422
00:22:39.075 --> 00:22:41.965
Saul went on one side of the mountain and David

423
00:22:42.065 --> 00:22:43.565
and his men on the other side of the mountain

424
00:22:43.865 --> 00:22:46.125
and David was hurrying to get away from Saul.

425
00:22:47.265 --> 00:22:49.685
And Saul is and his men closing in on David

426
00:22:49.745 --> 00:22:51.045
and men to capture them.

427
00:22:51.565 --> 00:22:54.885
A messenger came to Saul saying, hurry

428
00:22:54.945 --> 00:22:56.765
and come for the Philistines have made a raid

429
00:22:56.915 --> 00:22:57.925
against the land.

430
00:22:58.905 --> 00:23:00.165
So Saul returned from pursuing.

431
00:23:00.165 --> 00:23:02.405
David went against the Philistines.

432
00:23:02.405 --> 00:23:04.405
Therefore that place was called the rock of escape.

433
00:23:05.465 --> 00:23:06.925
And so you see what just happened here, right?

434
00:23:08.905 --> 00:23:11.725
God used the Philistines to deliver David from Saul

435
00:23:13.065 --> 00:23:15.525
by bringing this diversion,

436
00:23:18.085 --> 00:23:19.505
he brought a diversion, right?

437
00:23:19.805 --> 00:23:22.185
God used the Philistines to deliver David from Saul

438
00:23:22.335 --> 00:23:24.025
through a diversion

439
00:23:26.345 --> 00:23:30.075
Like Saul had committed all of his resources to chase David

440
00:23:30.765 --> 00:23:33.635
neglecting his primary responsibility was

441
00:23:33.635 --> 00:23:34.635
to protect the nation.

442
00:23:35.735 --> 00:23:37.875
And so this guy's coming like, Hey, hey Saul.

443
00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:38.955
The Philistines are about to win.

444
00:23:39.055 --> 00:23:41.395
And so he was forced to abandon the hunt, go back

445
00:23:41.395 --> 00:23:42.955
to the primary battle he was supposed to.

446
00:23:43.565 --> 00:23:47.485
Again, God used the Philistines to deliver David like the,

447
00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:51.525
the enemy army to deliver David from Saul.

448
00:23:53.395 --> 00:23:55.455
Now I know what you're thinking right now.

449
00:23:55.805 --> 00:23:58.775
Some of you were skeptical about that. Like, ah, come on.

450
00:23:58.775 --> 00:24:00.015
Really? That's just a coincidence.

451
00:24:00.055 --> 00:24:02.735
I mean that's not really God's doing.

452
00:24:02.795 --> 00:24:04.975
It doesn't actually say God did that.

453
00:24:05.365 --> 00:24:09.665
Well, here's how we know. Look back up at verse 14,

454
00:24:10.685 --> 00:24:12.745
the very last verse of the previous section,

455
00:24:17.755 --> 00:24:22.695
the end of that says, Saul sought David every day,

456
00:24:23.515 --> 00:24:27.335
but God did not give David into his hand.

457
00:24:30.315 --> 00:24:31.375
It wasn't coincidence.

458
00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:34.375
See that it was the Lord who was David's helper

459
00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:40.085
David, in this seemingly inescapable situation.

460
00:24:42.475 --> 00:24:44.895
But despite Saul's effort,

461
00:24:46.915 --> 00:24:49.055
God did not give David into Alsan.

462
00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:53.835
It was God. God was the one protecting,

463
00:24:54.085 --> 00:24:55.315
sustaining David.

464
00:24:57.155 --> 00:25:00.695
And David acknowledges this in Psalm 54.

465
00:25:01.405 --> 00:25:03.735
This is the Psalm that David wrote in the midst

466
00:25:03.755 --> 00:25:08.375
of this moment, Psalm 54 verse four, behold

467
00:25:08.995 --> 00:25:10.455
God is my helper.

468
00:25:10.875 --> 00:25:12.895
The Lord is the upholder of my life.

469
00:25:13.985 --> 00:25:15.235
Like David himself knew.

470
00:25:15.235 --> 00:25:17.755
He is like he wasn't his military ability to get

471
00:25:17.755 --> 00:25:19.955
around if he wasn't just 'cause he was faster than.

472
00:25:19.955 --> 00:25:23.385
So it was God upheld his life.

473
00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:32.015
So again, God used Jonathan to deliver David from fear

474
00:25:33.135 --> 00:25:35.385
through identity reminding him

475
00:25:35.385 --> 00:25:37.185
of God's sure promise in his life.

476
00:25:37.255 --> 00:25:38.985
This is who God says you are.

477
00:25:40.925 --> 00:25:44.145
And God used the Philistine army to deliver David from Saul

478
00:25:44.215 --> 00:25:45.385
through this diversion.

479
00:25:49.325 --> 00:25:50.825
So what does this all leave us with then?

480
00:25:54.155 --> 00:25:56.815
In other words, like what do we learn here? Like okay, what?

481
00:25:56.835 --> 00:25:59.135
What's the point of this?

482
00:26:01.095 --> 00:26:03.835
Why do we have this here? How does this apply to us?

483
00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:07.955
Well, let me offer you two ways.

484
00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:11.755
I'm sure you can find more, but but just two ways to today

485
00:26:14.645 --> 00:26:18.465
and and these are truths I believe we need to hold onto

486
00:26:19.445 --> 00:26:22.025
as we walk into similar situations in our lives.

487
00:26:23.085 --> 00:26:26.735
Here's the first truth. Like David,

488
00:26:28.315 --> 00:26:33.215
we have the same providential God in whom we can trust.

489
00:26:37.715 --> 00:26:41.535
We today, Christian, we have the same

490
00:26:42.885 --> 00:26:46.005
providential God in whom to trust.

491
00:26:48.145 --> 00:26:52.085
Now we don't use that word providence very much in our day.

492
00:26:52.105 --> 00:26:55.605
Here's what that big word means. It.

493
00:26:55.605 --> 00:27:00.175
It means that God not only created everything, he also

494
00:27:01.655 --> 00:27:06.165
oversees it and sustains it even down

495
00:27:06.185 --> 00:27:07.965
to the tiniest little details of

496
00:27:07.965 --> 00:27:08.965
Life.

497
00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:11.355
That's providence.

498
00:27:11.355 --> 00:27:14.235
Here's how the Westminster shorter catechism hundreds

499
00:27:14.235 --> 00:27:15.595
of years ago defines it.

500
00:27:16.445 --> 00:27:19.475
Providence is God's most holy, wise

501
00:27:19.655 --> 00:27:22.075
and powerful preserving

502
00:27:22.235 --> 00:27:24.635
and governing all his creatures and all their actions.

503
00:27:25.975 --> 00:27:29.355
So we talk about God as sovereign means He's in control.

504
00:27:29.365 --> 00:27:31.115
Providence means he's actively working

505
00:27:31.335 --> 00:27:34.945
to bring about his purpose in everything.

506
00:27:35.525 --> 00:27:37.225
And this is one of the great teachings of the Bible.

507
00:27:37.365 --> 00:27:40.345
And hear me, it's not meant for us to sit here

508
00:27:40.365 --> 00:27:44.905
and just simply conflict over it, theological debate over it

509
00:27:45.045 --> 00:27:46.305
and and worry about it.

510
00:27:46.455 --> 00:27:49.665
It's meant to be a source of comfort to us.

511
00:27:53.475 --> 00:27:55.495
See if this is who God was for David.

512
00:27:58.535 --> 00:28:00.315
And if God never changes,

513
00:28:03.505 --> 00:28:07.155
that means today He sustains us

514
00:28:08.385 --> 00:28:09.715
just as much as he did for

515
00:28:09.715 --> 00:28:10.715
David.

516
00:28:12.455 --> 00:28:16.795
If we are his, he sustains us just as he did for David.

517
00:28:17.055 --> 00:28:18.715
The same God who is at work

518
00:28:19.015 --> 00:28:23.355
to accomplish his purposes in David's life is the same God

519
00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:24.635
who has continued

520
00:28:24.735 --> 00:28:28.195
to work in his people throughout all the generations.

521
00:28:33.065 --> 00:28:37.605
And what that means is that we can trust that God's purposes

522
00:28:37.605 --> 00:28:40.565
and God's plan will be fulfilled in our lives.

523
00:28:42.145 --> 00:28:46.175
We can trust it. The Bible is clear

524
00:28:46.685 --> 00:28:50.975
that all of our days are counted out

525
00:28:52.495 --> 00:28:56.985
by God, that we will not live

526
00:28:57.365 --> 00:28:58.385
one second more

527
00:28:58.525 --> 00:29:01.865
or one second less than what he has ordained for us to live.

528
00:29:05.425 --> 00:29:09.155
There's a great sanctity of life passage in Psalm 1 39.

529
00:29:10.535 --> 00:29:12.555
And I want you to listen to this the way it says

530
00:29:12.555 --> 00:29:17.085
it for you.

531
00:29:17.305 --> 00:29:19.285
God formed my inward parts.

532
00:29:20.465 --> 00:29:22.885
You knitted me together in my mother's womb.

533
00:29:23.805 --> 00:29:26.565
I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

534
00:29:27.595 --> 00:29:31.005
Wonderful are your works. My soul knows it very well.

535
00:29:32.025 --> 00:29:35.405
My frame was not hidden from you when I was being made in

536
00:29:35.405 --> 00:29:38.485
secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth.

537
00:29:38.995 --> 00:29:42.445
Your eyes saw my unformed substance.

538
00:29:42.635 --> 00:29:46.365
Hear this in your book were written every one

539
00:29:46.365 --> 00:29:48.605
of them the days that were formed

540
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:52.295
For me When as yet there were none

541
00:29:52.295 --> 00:29:53.295
Of them.

542
00:29:58.565 --> 00:30:01.865
Now that truth does not give us freedom

543
00:30:03.085 --> 00:30:05.185
to be foolish and unwise

544
00:30:05.365 --> 00:30:07.785
and take unnecessary risks in our lives like

545
00:30:07.785 --> 00:30:09.185
skiing in an avalanche area.

546
00:30:09.295 --> 00:30:10.545
Like yeah, God's got me.

547
00:30:11.125 --> 00:30:12.585
You know, and you get buried, right?

548
00:30:12.655 --> 00:30:14.545
Like that's not what you're supposed to do with that.

549
00:30:17.455 --> 00:30:20.035
But it does mean it.

550
00:30:20.055 --> 00:30:23.275
It does mean that we can trust that God's purpose

551
00:30:23.335 --> 00:30:25.275
and plan will be fulfilled in our lives.

552
00:30:26.615 --> 00:30:28.985
He's providentially working it out.

553
00:30:29.085 --> 00:30:31.865
So whatever comes our way, God's got it.

554
00:30:33.195 --> 00:30:36.775
He is in control. He is overseeing it. Here's the point.

555
00:30:37.305 --> 00:30:40.375
Since God upholds our lives,

556
00:30:41.435 --> 00:30:42.775
We don't have to live in fear.

557
00:30:46.425 --> 00:30:48.215
Since the Lord upholds our lives,

558
00:30:48.925 --> 00:30:50.775
he's providential in all things.

559
00:30:50.925 --> 00:30:53.815
That means we don't have to fear, we don't have

560
00:30:53.815 --> 00:30:54.935
to worry about what could come.

561
00:30:55.035 --> 00:30:57.015
We don't have to worry about the ramifications of

562
00:30:57.165 --> 00:30:58.295
what might happen over there.

563
00:30:58.325 --> 00:31:01.255
Like we just don't worry because he is in control.

564
00:31:01.325 --> 00:31:04.575
Elizabeth Elliot, incredible woman of God said it this way.

565
00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:09.935
Fear arises when we imagine everything depends on

566
00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:10.175
Us.

567
00:31:14.805 --> 00:31:15.095
Fear

568
00:31:15.435 --> 00:31:19.715
Arises when we imagine everything depends on us, right?

569
00:31:19.715 --> 00:31:21.795
Isn't that true? You, I, I gotta control this.

570
00:31:21.835 --> 00:31:23.595
I can't control this, so I'm afraid, right?

571
00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:27.355
You're not in control. I'm not in control.

572
00:31:28.025 --> 00:31:30.075
When I have this illusion, I'm in control.

573
00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:31.515
That's whenever fear happens.

574
00:31:31.835 --> 00:31:33.795
'cause I feel like I can't control that

575
00:31:34.855 --> 00:31:39.715
Or this. And so

576
00:31:39.715 --> 00:31:42.755
Thankfully We have a God who

577
00:31:43.455 --> 00:31:45.505
Filters everything through His hands,

578
00:31:47.395 --> 00:31:51.175
Who is in full control of everything, in everyone.

579
00:31:51.355 --> 00:31:53.895
He is absolutely providential.

580
00:31:54.315 --> 00:31:58.935
And because he is working out a much bigger plan than

581
00:31:58.995 --> 00:32:03.745
merely my comfort, we can trust

582
00:32:03.935 --> 00:32:06.625
that he will use whatever comes in our lives

583
00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:08.785
For his glory and for our good.

584
00:32:12.595 --> 00:32:13.815
You think about David's life, man,

585
00:32:13.815 --> 00:32:16.295
there was some mystery in how God was working this out.

586
00:32:16.745 --> 00:32:19.655
David wasn't always clear how this was gonna play out.

587
00:32:19.655 --> 00:32:21.415
He kind of knew from the beginning what was,

588
00:32:21.475 --> 00:32:24.375
but he like, this doesn't look right.

589
00:32:24.445 --> 00:32:26.015
This doesn't look the way I think it should.

590
00:32:28.855 --> 00:32:30.715
But God's promises to him we're certain

591
00:32:34.795 --> 00:32:36.205
It's the same for us Today.

592
00:32:37.775 --> 00:32:39.765
We have the same providential God

593
00:32:39.765 --> 00:32:41.805
that we can trust in just like David did.

594
00:32:44.245 --> 00:32:45.465
So let's trust him right?

595
00:32:45.815 --> 00:32:49.145
When we face things, let's trust him.

596
00:32:51.585 --> 00:32:53.405
But there's a second truth we can learn here too.

597
00:32:55.935 --> 00:32:58.075
We learned this truth. And you may have,

598
00:32:58.075 --> 00:33:00.475
we've talked about this a little bit when we put on our

599
00:33:00.475 --> 00:33:02.995
Jesus goggles and we look at the Old Testament

600
00:33:02.995 --> 00:33:06.995
through those lenses like Jesus did in Luke, where he said,

601
00:33:07.055 --> 00:33:09.395
all of this points to me, we, we put on those glasses

602
00:33:09.615 --> 00:33:12.035
and we look through the lens to the Old Testament, to

603
00:33:12.035 --> 00:33:16.955
what Jesus shows up, how he shows up there.

604
00:33:18.185 --> 00:33:20.245
We see it that way. So here's follow this.

605
00:33:21.075 --> 00:33:24.045
Look at how this plays out in in verse 25.

606
00:33:24.095 --> 00:33:27.325
Where does, where does it say that David went to hide,

607
00:33:29.285 --> 00:33:30.545
he went to hide in the rock

608
00:33:33.175 --> 00:33:34.355
in in verse 26.

609
00:33:35.585 --> 00:33:38.795
What was it that hid him from Saul?

610
00:33:39.815 --> 00:33:42.035
It was the mountain rock.

611
00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:49.405
It was that mountain. Verse 28 says, was renamed

612
00:33:50.345 --> 00:33:51.925
the rock of escape?

613
00:33:54.825 --> 00:33:55.895
Maybe. See where this is going.

614
00:33:57.195 --> 00:33:59.505
It Was the rock

615
00:34:00.135 --> 00:34:02.505
that God used to save.

616
00:34:02.715 --> 00:34:03.065
David,

617
00:34:08.225 --> 00:34:09.645
here's, here's what you need to know.

618
00:34:09.665 --> 00:34:11.085
Here's what we need to remember.

619
00:34:12.805 --> 00:34:14.585
That's still how God works today.

620
00:34:16.835 --> 00:34:18.935
The difference though is

621
00:34:18.935 --> 00:34:22.975
that we have a greater rock in which to hide

622
00:34:25.245 --> 00:34:27.065
and notice that R is capitalized.

623
00:34:29.205 --> 00:34:33.745
We have a greater rock in which we can hide.

624
00:34:36.385 --> 00:34:40.645
See the rocks that sheltered David were merely granite

625
00:34:40.785 --> 00:34:45.245
or sandstone or whatever rock formation it was.

626
00:34:45.585 --> 00:34:48.605
And yes, God used those rocks

627
00:34:49.105 --> 00:34:51.885
to save David from Saul.

628
00:34:52.865 --> 00:34:56.685
But the rock I'm referring to is found in Psalm one 18,

629
00:34:57.055 --> 00:34:58.325
verse 22, 1

630
00:34:58.325 --> 00:35:00.365
of the most quoted scriptures in the New Testament.

631
00:35:00.435 --> 00:35:03.365
It's this verse pointing us to Christ.

632
00:35:03.545 --> 00:35:06.925
It says this, the stone that the builders

633
00:35:07.485 --> 00:35:10.205
rejected has become the cornerstone.

634
00:35:12.645 --> 00:35:14.225
So no offense to Dwayne Johnson.

635
00:35:14.695 --> 00:35:17.425
This is the true rock, right?

636
00:35:17.425 --> 00:35:20.705
This is the rock, the cornerstone of our faith.

637
00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:24.105
The most important piece of the entire foundation.

638
00:35:24.365 --> 00:35:28.505
The cornerstone Jesus is the dividing line of salvation.

639
00:35:28.845 --> 00:35:32.585
The only solid rock on which we can build our lives

640
00:35:32.815 --> 00:35:33.825
that will last forever.

641
00:35:34.615 --> 00:35:38.445
He's the Isaiah 26 Everlasting rock of ages,

642
00:35:38.705 --> 00:35:40.565
the secure foundation of our lives.

643
00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:43.565
He's the one Deuteronomy 32 calls the rock

644
00:35:43.695 --> 00:35:45.045
whose work is perfect.

645
00:35:45.585 --> 00:35:49.005
All his ways are justice without iniquity. He's faithful.

646
00:35:49.235 --> 00:35:52.005
He's the one the Psalms refer to as the rock

647
00:35:52.265 --> 00:35:56.405
and my fortress, my deliverer, my God in whom I take refuge,

648
00:35:56.945 --> 00:36:00.725
my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.

649
00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:05.645
He is the one, one Corinthians 10 calls the rock as Christ.

650
00:36:06.425 --> 00:36:09.205
He is the one we come to for living water.

651
00:36:09.425 --> 00:36:11.965
The one we come to for eternal water.

652
00:36:12.385 --> 00:36:16.405
The one we come to whose foundation will not be shaken even

653
00:36:16.405 --> 00:36:18.445
when the flood waters rise.

654
00:36:18.635 --> 00:36:21.365
Matthew seven says, see, this is the truth.

655
00:36:21.865 --> 00:36:25.325
Christ is the rock in which we can hide.

656
00:36:26.305 --> 00:36:30.405
He is the one who stands between us and the enemy.

657
00:36:31.745 --> 00:36:35.525
He is the one who laid his life down in between us

658
00:36:35.905 --> 00:36:37.125
to pay our penalty.

659
00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:43.845
He hides us like, don't think, well, I gotta go hide.

660
00:36:43.965 --> 00:36:48.085
I gotta hide. He hides us. He protects us. He preserves us.

661
00:36:48.225 --> 00:36:51.565
He saves us from sin. He saves us from the enemy.

662
00:36:51.705 --> 00:36:53.605
He saves us from death eternally.

663
00:36:55.955 --> 00:36:58.445
That is why church, that is why Hannah,

664
00:36:58.715 --> 00:37:00.325
back in one Samuel two, two,

665
00:37:00.465 --> 00:37:01.925
if you remember all the way back to

666
00:37:01.925 --> 00:37:04.285
that point when she prayed, what did she pray?

667
00:37:04.415 --> 00:37:07.365
There is none holy like the Lord,

668
00:37:08.465 --> 00:37:10.205
for there is none besides you.

669
00:37:10.735 --> 00:37:13.285
There is no rock like our God.

670
00:37:15.505 --> 00:37:20.445
And so church with, with Psalm 95, 1 as our anthem,

671
00:37:20.895 --> 00:37:22.925
let's stand together and come.

672
00:37:23.185 --> 00:37:24.725
Let us sing to the Lord.

673
00:37:25.025 --> 00:37:29.405
Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.

674
00:37:30.175 --> 00:37:31.045
Let's do that together.
