1
00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.565
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:06.765
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:09.525
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.885
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:17.045
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:25.765
Well, good morning, church.

7
00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:29.685
Happy belated thanksgiving.

8
00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:34.765
You know, I enjoy singing that song, especially in light of

9
00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:37.885
what we're going to talk about this morning,

10
00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.965
but we have a great deal to be thankful for.

11
00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:47.165
Amen. Well, um, this morning we're in the book of Psalms.

12
00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:50.365
Pastor John was out this week for Thanksgiving.

13
00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:54.125
Uh, starting next week we're gonna have a three week series

14
00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:58.645
in the run up to Christmas called God with Us, and then

15
00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:00.405
after the new year back into

16
00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:03.125
our series on the book of one Samuel.

17
00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:06.805
But right now, if you have a Bible, please turn with me to

18
00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:08.605
the book of Psalm.

19
00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:13.375
Psalms chapter 77, Psalm chapter 77.

20
00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:15.775
And as you turn there, I just have a question for you,

21
00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:20.855
whether you have ever experienced a solar eclipse.

22
00:01:21.735 --> 00:01:23.615
I don't know if you've ever witnessed

23
00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:25.175
or seen a solar eclipse.

24
00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:27.935
We had one back in April, I believe it was,

25
00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:29.895
and we traveled down, my family

26
00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:32.335
and I traveled down to Dallas where we were in

27
00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:34.855
what they call the path of totality.

28
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.535
It's where, you know, you're, you're in the center

29
00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:41.855
of the shadow of the moon, obviously in an eclipse.

30
00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:46.215
What happens is the moon moves between the earth

31
00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:49.295
and the sun and it doesn't totally wash out the whole

32
00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:50.455
planet, right?

33
00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.615
It's localized.

34
00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:55.255
There's a shadow that's cost, that's cast depending on

35
00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:58.255
where you're standing and where on earth you are.

36
00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:02.695
But this is a picture, uh, sorry, do we have the picture?

37
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.935
Yeah. Um, our, our own Mark Tyson, he's up here singing.

38
00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:09.575
He's also a great photographer as well.

39
00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:12.695
And he took this picture of the solar eclipse.

40
00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:15.775
One of the things that I love about this picture is that

41
00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:19.415
whenever you have the full eclipse, what you can see,

42
00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:20.895
you cannot see the sun.

43
00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:23.535
But there are certain details

44
00:02:23.605 --> 00:02:25.975
that you can pick up in the absence

45
00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:27.655
of the radiance of the sun.

46
00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:31.415
If it's light and heat that's sort of temporarily obscured.

47
00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:35.455
You can see the corona around the outline of the moon.

48
00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:37.975
You can see solar flares and um,

49
00:02:38.395 --> 00:02:41.935
and anyway, this is what happens in a solar eclipse.

50
00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:45.265
The lights seem to go out, it gets darker,

51
00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:49.425
the temperature drops and the animals even respond.

52
00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:51.865
It's like knights beginning to set end

53
00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:54.105
and then of course it doesn't.

54
00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:58.705
It's like the sun has gone away. But of course it hasn't.

55
00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:03.245
And here in Psalm 77, it's a little bit like that.

56
00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:06.325
Sometimes we have the experience

57
00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:09.525
where we feel like God has gone silent.

58
00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:14.005
It's as though our spiritual life is experiencing

59
00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:15.805
a, an eclipse.

60
00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:18.245
It's like God has changed

61
00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:20.285
or maybe vanished out of our lives.

62
00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:24.365
Perhaps we even begin to ask questions about God that feel

63
00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:26.405
dangerous and concerning.

64
00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:29.605
They're painful. We feel like maybe God doesn't care

65
00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:32.525
or he's not there, or he's no longer active.

66
00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:35.405
But the thing that we need to remember

67
00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:38.965
and call to mine is that this is only

68
00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:43.485
a temporary feeling or experience.

69
00:03:43.595 --> 00:03:45.445
It's something that we're experiencing

70
00:03:46.105 --> 00:03:49.205
in the moment from our limited vantage point.

71
00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:53.725
Just like you might experience in an eclipse, it feels dark,

72
00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.445
it feels confusing or scary.

73
00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:00.925
Or maybe it's like when the storm clouds roll

74
00:04:01.025 --> 00:04:02.285
in and what do we say?

75
00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:04.685
You get up and the day it's just bleak and dark

76
00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:06.805
because the clouds cover the sky.

77
00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:09.765
We say something like The sun is not out today.

78
00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:14.005
But of course that is only our perspective.

79
00:04:14.425 --> 00:04:18.125
Here's the good news about solar eclipses and about storms

80
00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:20.365
and clouds and darkness in the world.

81
00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:24.765
It never changes the fact that the sun

82
00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:26.805
is always shining.

83
00:04:27.665 --> 00:04:29.685
The sun is always shining.

84
00:04:29.905 --> 00:04:34.485
And so it is with the goodness and the glory

85
00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:36.445
and the unchangeable nature

86
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:40.765
and the unchanging love of the goodness of God.

87
00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:43.525
That's why we just sang about it, that God is

88
00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:47.245
so good no matter what we're going through.

89
00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:52.085
God has not changed even if it sometimes

90
00:04:52.455 --> 00:04:53.925
feels that way.

91
00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:58.485
So I wanna read in Psalm chapter 77, which I think has a lot

92
00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:00.085
to say about this.

93
00:05:01.145 --> 00:05:04.525
And Psalm 77 I think really comes in two parts.

94
00:05:04.915 --> 00:05:07.725
There's the first half and the second half.

95
00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:10.605
And we'll read from verses one to nine.

96
00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:13.645
I believe you could really include verse 10 in that as well.

97
00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:15.325
But I'll mention that here in a moment.

98
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:17.645
We'll read first verses one to nine.

99
00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:19.565
If you have a Bible, I would invite you

100
00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:20.965
to please follow along.

101
00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:26.515
I cry aloud to God, aloud to God,

102
00:05:26.695 --> 00:05:30.725
and he will hear me in the day of my trouble.

103
00:05:31.445 --> 00:05:33.965
I seek the Lord in the night.

104
00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:37.125
My hand is stretched out without wearying.

105
00:05:37.865 --> 00:05:40.365
My soul refuses to be comforted.

106
00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:44.005
When I remember God, I moan.

107
00:05:45.195 --> 00:05:50.085
When I meditate, my spirit faints say, law,

108
00:05:51.795 --> 00:05:54.255
you hold my eyelids open.

109
00:05:55.575 --> 00:05:58.405
I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

110
00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:02.465
I consider the days of old. The years long ago.

111
00:06:02.665 --> 00:06:05.585
I said, let me remember my song in the night.

112
00:06:06.735 --> 00:06:08.795
Let me meditate in my heart.

113
00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:13.055
Then my spirit made a diligent search.

114
00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:18.135
Will the Lord's sper forever and never again be favorable?

115
00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:22.535
Has his steadfast love forever ceased?

116
00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:26.935
Are his promises at an end for all time?

117
00:06:27.995 --> 00:06:30.415
Has God forgotten to be gracious?

118
00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:34.975
Has he in anger shut up his compassion?

119
00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:38.495
Sayah, please join me in prayer.

120
00:06:40.515 --> 00:06:42.195
Almighty God, we thank you this morning

121
00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:44.275
for the light of your word.

122
00:06:45.345 --> 00:06:47.635
Lord, we thank you for Psalm 77

123
00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:50.835
and the reminders that we will find here.

124
00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:53.795
I pray, God that you would speak it to our heart.

125
00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:57.315
Now, in Jesus' mighty name, amen.

126
00:06:58.825 --> 00:07:02.475
Well, Psalm 77, if you study it is categorized as

127
00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:05.435
what we would call a biblical lament.

128
00:07:06.095 --> 00:07:10.835
Now a lament is simply a saying or a song or a poem

129
00:07:11.335 --> 00:07:13.475
or an expression of pain.

130
00:07:14.575 --> 00:07:17.715
Lament can be, it can be Christian or otherwise.

131
00:07:18.175 --> 00:07:20.915
It can just be saying, I feel bad,

132
00:07:22.035 --> 00:07:25.155
I am in trouble, I have distress.

133
00:07:25.175 --> 00:07:26.515
And that's just what a lament can be.

134
00:07:26.515 --> 00:07:29.635
It can be grief and sorrow of any kind.

135
00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:33.915
But what's different in the Bible, especially in the Book

136
00:07:33.915 --> 00:07:38.275
of Psalms when we have biblical laments, is

137
00:07:38.275 --> 00:07:42.115
that there is that kind of an expression of sorrow

138
00:07:42.775 --> 00:07:46.795
and grief that is real and deep and tangible.

139
00:07:47.855 --> 00:07:51.475
But there's also another layer that's really important

140
00:07:51.975 --> 00:07:55.915
and it's the second layer that makes it uniquely biblical.

141
00:07:56.335 --> 00:07:59.555
So the first part, scholars would say in a biblical event,

142
00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:03.035
you have the passion that exists there.

143
00:08:03.035 --> 00:08:04.755
That's the suffering and the sorrow

144
00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:08.035
and the grief, the circumstance, the lament.

145
00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:12.315
But you also have a progression.

146
00:08:13.335 --> 00:08:17.315
You have a moving away from that, a starting point of grief,

147
00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:20.795
but then there is movement away from that

148
00:08:21.415 --> 00:08:23.035
upward and toward God.

149
00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:27.355
And so that's what we see in a biblical lament.

150
00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:30.715
It moves from obvious pain

151
00:08:31.695 --> 00:08:33.235
to overt praise.

152
00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.555
It moves from sighing on the one hand

153
00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:38.835
to singing on the other.

154
00:08:39.215 --> 00:08:43.155
It moves from today's sorrow to tomorrow's joy.

155
00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:45.755
It moves from a crisis of faith

156
00:08:46.255 --> 00:08:48.355
to a confidence in God.

157
00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:53.515
It starts low and it goes high.

158
00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:55.405
There's progress.

159
00:08:55.595 --> 00:08:58.805
It's always going somewhere no matter where you start.

160
00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:02.485
And I think this is the invitation of Psalm 77.

161
00:09:02.795 --> 00:09:05.245
It's the admonition of Psalm 77.

162
00:09:05.465 --> 00:09:09.605
No matter where you start, always move Godward,

163
00:09:10.305 --> 00:09:12.325
always move, move godward.

164
00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:18.325
So in a biblical lament also, it's not merely complaining

165
00:09:19.105 --> 00:09:23.605
or venting or lamenting or emoting like we might sing.

166
00:09:23.675 --> 00:09:27.445
I've got friends in low places or there's a tear in my beer

167
00:09:27.685 --> 00:09:29.285
'cause I'm crying for you dear.

168
00:09:29.515 --> 00:09:31.285
Wait, there's a Baptist church.

169
00:09:32.235 --> 00:09:35.885
Okay, um, well, you know, some of you know that song.

170
00:09:36.005 --> 00:09:38.525
I have no doubt. Okay, that's too lament.

171
00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:42.725
But in a biblical lament, we're moving towards God

172
00:09:43.435 --> 00:09:45.325
from a place of pain.

173
00:09:45.415 --> 00:09:49.445
We're not just staying there. So it's instructive.

174
00:09:49.645 --> 00:09:52.245
A verse, a chapter like this, it's formative.

175
00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:55.405
I mean, think about this. Psalm 77 has been around

176
00:09:55.505 --> 00:09:57.885
for likely 3000 years,

177
00:09:58.255 --> 00:10:01.245
originally written in the Hebrew language translated into

178
00:10:01.765 --> 00:10:04.685
thousands of languages across the planet and through time.

179
00:10:05.745 --> 00:10:08.765
And so for thousands of years, these words

180
00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:11.725
have both instructed and taught

181
00:10:12.305 --> 00:10:14.645
and shaped God's people

182
00:10:14.785 --> 00:10:17.845
and how we view our circumstances

183
00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:21.765
and also how we approach God from a place of suffering.

184
00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:25.065
And that brings us ultimately to my first point

185
00:10:25.575 --> 00:10:28.785
here this morning is that when we experience grief

186
00:10:29.245 --> 00:10:32.345
or sorrow, the kinds of things that would cause you

187
00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:36.715
to lament, uh, the thing that we wanna see here is

188
00:10:36.715 --> 00:10:39.955
to not be surprised, but that we ought to expect

189
00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:42.755
that our faith is going to be tested.

190
00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:45.755
So that's the first point, is that you should expect

191
00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:48.315
your faith to be tested.

192
00:10:49.495 --> 00:10:53.875
You know, as a new believer, I remember being shocked, uh,

193
00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:58.555
fra frankly, I remember being rocked by some of the grief

194
00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.755
that came my way spiritually speaking.

195
00:11:01.175 --> 00:11:04.515
I'd felt I'd experienced God in a really new and unique way

196
00:11:04.935 --> 00:11:07.435
and delivered from sin and struggles

197
00:11:07.615 --> 00:11:09.115
and all kinds of things.

198
00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:13.555
And it was like clear skies and my life had changed.

199
00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.035
I started to follow Jesus and live a Christian life.

200
00:11:16.295 --> 00:11:19.395
And then some of the old things began to creep in.

201
00:11:19.395 --> 00:11:22.475
There was spiritual darkness or bad circumstances,

202
00:11:22.735 --> 00:11:24.995
and I was struggling with God.

203
00:11:25.155 --> 00:11:28.475
I remember struggling deeply with that. I was discouraged.

204
00:11:29.235 --> 00:11:32.115
I was calling out to God like, Hey, this isn't working.

205
00:11:32.705 --> 00:11:35.115
Where's God? You know, that's how I felt.

206
00:11:36.335 --> 00:11:41.235
And, but ultimately I remember coming out the other side of

207
00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:42.355
that experience,

208
00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:45.355
what the ancients might call the dark night of the soul.

209
00:11:45.515 --> 00:11:47.795
I remember coming through that for the first time

210
00:11:48.415 --> 00:11:50.235
and feeling again, a sense

211
00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:52.635
of encouragement I hadn't known before.

212
00:11:52.835 --> 00:11:54.325
I feel a sense of strength.

213
00:11:54.445 --> 00:11:56.045
I didn't know I felt like I knew God better.

214
00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:58.765
I felt like I loved God more genuinely for

215
00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:00.005
who he actually is.

216
00:12:00.505 --> 00:12:04.685
And, and I sensed at a deeper level his love for me.

217
00:12:06.275 --> 00:12:07.535
And uh, and

218
00:12:07.535 --> 00:12:08.975
and frankly, this is a cycle

219
00:12:09.765 --> 00:12:12.735
that I could say has repeated itself in my life

220
00:12:13.435 --> 00:12:14.815
in a number of different ways.

221
00:12:15.675 --> 00:12:19.255
And um, you know, if you're a believer here this morning,

222
00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:23.855
then I, I assume you probably know this kind of cycle

223
00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:24.895
that I'm talking about.

224
00:12:24.955 --> 00:12:27.895
You've experienced this. If you haven't, how's the saying?

225
00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:30.935
Go. Just wait. It's coming. Right?

226
00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:35.495
And then for some of you, you're there right now for some

227
00:12:35.495 --> 00:12:37.695
of you here in this room or listening to my voice,

228
00:12:38.075 --> 00:12:39.575
you're here right now.

229
00:12:39.595 --> 00:12:42.175
You're suffering struggling.

230
00:12:42.175 --> 00:12:45.135
You're asking God questions you never thought you'd ask.

231
00:12:45.235 --> 00:12:46.615
You're having feelings.

232
00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:49.095
You're, you're having concerns

233
00:12:49.095 --> 00:12:51.015
that maybe have never crossed your mind

234
00:12:51.205 --> 00:12:52.575
towards God as a believer.

235
00:12:52.595 --> 00:12:53.775
And yet here you are.

236
00:12:54.195 --> 00:12:58.175
And my hope and my prayer is that this morning in Psalm 77,

237
00:12:58.835 --> 00:13:01.735
you will be encouraged by God's word.

238
00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:06.015
And may the spirit of God work in all of us to strengthen us

239
00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:08.015
and encouraged us in our faith.

240
00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:10.815
These, these trials

241
00:13:10.815 --> 00:13:12.455
that come our way, they're often different.

242
00:13:12.485 --> 00:13:14.655
They're never fun, they're always hard.

243
00:13:15.035 --> 00:13:17.335
But absolutely our first point again is

244
00:13:17.335 --> 00:13:19.575
that they should be expected.

245
00:13:19.775 --> 00:13:22.335
I mean, just listen to the words of Jesus in John 16.

246
00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:26.055
In this world you will have trouble.

247
00:13:28.275 --> 00:13:32.675
But take heart, I have overcome the world.

248
00:13:33.455 --> 00:13:37.795
And one Peter the apostle says, beloved, do not be

249
00:13:38.745 --> 00:13:42.715
surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you

250
00:13:42.735 --> 00:13:43.755
to test you

251
00:13:44.215 --> 00:13:47.475
as though something strange was happening to you.

252
00:13:48.535 --> 00:13:51.475
But instead, rejoice insofar

253
00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.795
as your you share in Christ's suffering,

254
00:13:54.795 --> 00:13:56.475
that you may also rejoice

255
00:13:56.475 --> 00:13:58.595
and be glad when his glory is revealed.

256
00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:01.605
And of course, James chapter one which says,

257
00:14:01.605 --> 00:14:05.365
count it all joy my brothers, when you meet trials

258
00:14:05.385 --> 00:14:07.765
of various kinds for you know this,

259
00:14:08.835 --> 00:14:11.525
this is not something you suspect or hope

260
00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:15.085
or wonder If you've read your Bible, we know it's clear.

261
00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:20.285
We know that the testing of our faith produces something.

262
00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:25.205
And it's not just sorrow, it's going somewhere.

263
00:14:25.745 --> 00:14:29.445
It produces and creates steadfastness in us.

264
00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:33.605
And the admonition here is let steadfastness have its full

265
00:14:33.605 --> 00:14:36.325
effect so that you may be perfect

266
00:14:36.545 --> 00:14:38.885
and complete, lacking in nothing.

267
00:14:39.425 --> 00:14:41.485
Are you perfect and complete?

268
00:14:43.205 --> 00:14:44.815
Then you're a work in progress.

269
00:14:44.875 --> 00:14:49.615
And God is using these things in your life and mine to shape

270
00:14:49.715 --> 00:14:52.405
and mold us to become more like him so

271
00:14:52.405 --> 00:14:54.965
that he can use us in the world the way he's called

272
00:14:54.965 --> 00:14:56.795
us to serve him.

273
00:14:57.695 --> 00:15:00.275
So expect your faith to be tested.

274
00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:01.835
I mean the opposite is this.

275
00:15:02.255 --> 00:15:06.915
If you do not expect that your faith will be tested,

276
00:15:08.145 --> 00:15:10.105
then what?

277
00:15:10.105 --> 00:15:11.585
What will be your experience?

278
00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:12.785
I think it's like Peter said,

279
00:15:13.165 --> 00:15:15.625
you will think it's strange when it happens.

280
00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:18.905
You will think it's abnormal or unusual

281
00:15:19.445 --> 00:15:23.105
and you'll question God and you'll be deeply discouraged.

282
00:15:23.245 --> 00:15:25.265
And I would say, you know, well ask questions like this.

283
00:15:25.365 --> 00:15:27.185
Why would God allow this?

284
00:15:27.405 --> 00:15:30.665
Why would God use this tool to form you

285
00:15:30.765 --> 00:15:34.225
and to shape me to be more like who he is called us to be?

286
00:15:34.405 --> 00:15:38.765
Why? Well, I think the answer becomes crystal clear.

287
00:15:38.915 --> 00:15:42.245
It's because God deeply loves you.

288
00:15:43.165 --> 00:15:46.775
It's because God loves you and he cares about you.

289
00:15:47.315 --> 00:15:50.535
And he's thinking about you not merely in the moment,

290
00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.455
but he's thinking about what he's doing in

291
00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:55.815
and through your life, not only now,

292
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.935
but throughout all eternity.

293
00:15:57.965 --> 00:16:01.815
He's a very long timeline in mind and,

294
00:16:01.875 --> 00:16:05.215
and we are under construction if you will.

295
00:16:05.275 --> 00:16:09.375
So God loves you and he wants to stretch and strengthen

296
00:16:09.475 --> 00:16:13.535
and mature you to grow and deepen your faith.

297
00:16:13.675 --> 00:16:16.335
If your faith is like roots going out from a tree,

298
00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:18.815
the deeper and the further they go,

299
00:16:18.915 --> 00:16:20.855
the stronger the tree is going to stand.

300
00:16:21.475 --> 00:16:24.055
So when the storms come, they can take it.

301
00:16:24.055 --> 00:16:25.775
Just think about like an illustration.

302
00:16:25.775 --> 00:16:29.855
Think about the way that toddlers learn to walk, right?

303
00:16:29.915 --> 00:16:32.615
We they, they begin to walk and we're so excited

304
00:16:32.675 --> 00:16:34.895
and we, we hold them and guide them

305
00:16:34.915 --> 00:16:37.535
and we catch them for a little while.

306
00:16:38.315 --> 00:16:39.615
You know? So any of you, if you've had

307
00:16:40.135 --> 00:16:41.255
children, what do you do?

308
00:16:41.275 --> 00:16:45.895
At some point, you're so mean that you stop catching them.

309
00:16:46.515 --> 00:16:49.095
You stop holding and guiding them and what happens?

310
00:16:49.525 --> 00:16:51.575
They fall on their rear, right?

311
00:16:51.575 --> 00:16:54.575
They fall on their face, they get bumps and bruises.

312
00:16:54.855 --> 00:16:56.215
I mean, sometimes you worry like

313
00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:57.495
you're like, what are people gonna think?

314
00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:01.495
Like my kids hit his head five times this week

315
00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:04.415
and it shows bumps and bruises.

316
00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:06.015
Well, you know, God is a loving father

317
00:17:07.115 --> 00:17:10.135
and he wants us to learn

318
00:17:10.355 --> 00:17:13.265
to walk as we follow him.

319
00:17:13.925 --> 00:17:17.185
And he allows at times, bumps and bruises along the way

320
00:17:17.295 --> 00:17:22.065
because he is, has in view the maturity that's happening,

321
00:17:22.445 --> 00:17:24.985
the progress that's taste taking place.

322
00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:27.865
And so the Lord is doing this

323
00:17:28.165 --> 00:17:29.945
as a loving father in our lives.

324
00:17:30.205 --> 00:17:31.905
You could think about the refiners fire

325
00:17:31.915 --> 00:17:33.585
where the heat's turned up

326
00:17:33.605 --> 00:17:36.865
and the impurities rise to the top of the gold or silver

327
00:17:37.005 --> 00:17:39.705
and that's removed and it becomes more pure

328
00:17:40.165 --> 00:17:42.545
and precious where you think about the, the steel

329
00:17:42.565 --> 00:17:44.345
that's folded in on itself

330
00:17:44.405 --> 00:17:47.225
and mixed together to become stronger and harder.

331
00:17:47.725 --> 00:17:50.245
Or it's like why some of you guys lift weights.

332
00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:53.645
We call it resistance training, right?

333
00:17:53.645 --> 00:17:55.245
Because if you do enough of it,

334
00:17:55.265 --> 00:17:57.445
it makes you feel weak in the process.

335
00:17:58.405 --> 00:18:01.585
But what's happening is you're actually getting stronger.

336
00:18:02.075 --> 00:18:06.945
Psalm 77, what we experience here, the author is Asaf,

337
00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:11.305
this psalmist, he has some unspecified struggle

338
00:18:11.335 --> 00:18:13.465
that he's crying out to God about.

339
00:18:14.605 --> 00:18:16.505
But you know, I think it's a mercy of God

340
00:18:16.505 --> 00:18:19.305
that he doesn't detail what the struggle is.

341
00:18:19.365 --> 00:18:21.465
If he said, Hey, I'm worried about paying the mortgage,

342
00:18:21.925 --> 00:18:23.105
or I'm worried about my health,

343
00:18:23.165 --> 00:18:26.265
or I'm worried about my kids, then we would say, when I have

344
00:18:26.265 --> 00:18:29.785
that specific problem, I would go to Psalm 77 and pray this.

345
00:18:30.565 --> 00:18:31.905
But the mercy of God is

346
00:18:31.905 --> 00:18:33.585
that we don't know what his problem is.

347
00:18:33.885 --> 00:18:37.385
So it means every problem, every distress that you have,

348
00:18:37.605 --> 00:18:38.865
you can read this psalm

349
00:18:39.005 --> 00:18:41.985
and you can draw near to God through its words.

350
00:18:42.085 --> 00:18:43.185
And so we read here,

351
00:18:43.185 --> 00:18:46.225
we just hear this guy praying and crying out to God.

352
00:18:46.245 --> 00:18:49.945
The first four verses, it says, I cry aloud to God,

353
00:18:50.915 --> 00:18:54.505
aloud to God and he will hear me.

354
00:18:55.565 --> 00:18:57.825
So first he's just pleading with God

355
00:18:58.285 --> 00:19:00.585
and in fact he's vocalizing this.

356
00:19:01.165 --> 00:19:03.345
And I would encourage you, if you've never done this,

357
00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:06.985
if you only ever pray in the privacy of your own heart

358
00:19:06.985 --> 00:19:09.385
and mind, I would say if you have to get outside

359
00:19:09.445 --> 00:19:11.145
or like Jesus said, go to your closet,

360
00:19:11.825 --> 00:19:15.705
I would pray out loud just like you would speak to anyone

361
00:19:16.005 --> 00:19:17.865
and pray to God out loud.

362
00:19:18.205 --> 00:19:22.585
But here, right here in the first verse, there is a seed

363
00:19:22.605 --> 00:19:23.665
of faith that exists.

364
00:19:23.725 --> 00:19:27.265
He says, he will hear me.

365
00:19:28.655 --> 00:19:32.105
What? He would not even bother to pray if he didn't think

366
00:19:32.105 --> 00:19:35.745
that there was a hope that God is listening and that God can

367
00:19:35.805 --> 00:19:36.945
and will respond.

368
00:19:37.795 --> 00:19:42.465
Verse two, in the day of my trouble, I seek the Lord.

369
00:19:42.655 --> 00:19:45.905
This is what I do in the night.

370
00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:48.985
My hand is stretched out without wearing my soul.

371
00:19:49.045 --> 00:19:51.025
It refuses to be comforted.

372
00:19:51.605 --> 00:19:56.185
Either he is not going to relent in his pursuit of God

373
00:19:56.645 --> 00:20:00.905
or he's so exhausted from his pursuit of God.

374
00:20:01.485 --> 00:20:03.745
His soul is not being comforted.

375
00:20:05.095 --> 00:20:09.945
When I remember God, I moan, when I meditate,

376
00:20:09.965 --> 00:20:11.425
my spirit faints.

377
00:20:11.575 --> 00:20:13.665
He's overwhelmed. This is painful.

378
00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:16.705
Verse four, you hold my eyelids open.

379
00:20:17.845 --> 00:20:20.545
I'm so troubled that I cannot speak.

380
00:20:22.885 --> 00:20:25.635
Think about the distress that this man feels.

381
00:20:26.145 --> 00:20:27.555
Some of you know what it feels like

382
00:20:28.055 --> 00:20:30.555
to feel like God is prying your eyes open.

383
00:20:30.555 --> 00:20:32.195
You're trying to sleep and rest.

384
00:20:32.695 --> 00:20:34.595
You know, the experts say if you just get

385
00:20:34.595 --> 00:20:35.715
some sleep, it will help.

386
00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:38.035
And you say, well I'm trying

387
00:20:38.975 --> 00:20:41.955
but I'm, I feel like God's holding my eyes open

388
00:20:42.815 --> 00:20:43.995
and so I can't get sleep.

389
00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:46.795
I need sleep. I'm so distressed

390
00:20:46.795 --> 00:20:48.125
and weighed down and burdened.

391
00:20:48.285 --> 00:20:50.845
I can't even speak or think.

392
00:20:51.635 --> 00:20:54.925
This brings us to our second point, which is this, cry out

393
00:20:54.925 --> 00:20:59.405
to God with honesty and with humility.

394
00:21:00.305 --> 00:21:02.925
You know, this chapter is an example to us to be real

395
00:21:03.425 --> 00:21:05.845
and honest with God.

396
00:21:05.905 --> 00:21:08.045
You know, if we don't, if we're not honest with God,

397
00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:09.965
we're frankly just fooling ourselves.

398
00:21:10.705 --> 00:21:12.045
You know, sometimes we want to,

399
00:21:12.045 --> 00:21:13.685
we think it doesn't sound spiritual

400
00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:16.645
or religious to you know, we, we gotta sort

401
00:21:16.645 --> 00:21:20.085
of put on a show towards God and and he's not fooled it all.

402
00:21:20.085 --> 00:21:21.205
We wanna stuff that.

403
00:21:21.665 --> 00:21:25.725
But it's like what one author said to do that is both it.

404
00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:28.285
It's pious and poisonous.

405
00:21:29.025 --> 00:21:31.565
So it looks religious, it looks spiritual

406
00:21:31.585 --> 00:21:32.805
to not really be honest.

407
00:21:33.265 --> 00:21:36.125
But then what happens is we just hold that inside

408
00:21:36.265 --> 00:21:38.085
and it goes sour inside.

409
00:21:38.835 --> 00:21:42.365
It's like painting over mold or some other contamination

410
00:21:42.365 --> 00:21:44.605
or putting a bandaid on cancer, right?

411
00:21:44.825 --> 00:21:45.925
It doesn't change it.

412
00:21:45.925 --> 00:21:49.685
It doesn't fix it, it only masks it for the moment.

413
00:21:51.405 --> 00:21:54.455
ASAP doesn't pretend to feel any better than he does

414
00:21:54.755 --> 00:21:57.415
and it's just a good reminder to us that we ought

415
00:21:57.415 --> 00:22:00.175
to be emotionally honest with God.

416
00:22:01.175 --> 00:22:04.425
Even if you can't be with other people, you, you can be

417
00:22:04.565 --> 00:22:05.585
and we should be with God.

418
00:22:05.605 --> 00:22:07.425
So honestly, crying out to God

419
00:22:07.425 --> 00:22:11.785
and also humbly crying out to God, he's the author here,

420
00:22:11.785 --> 00:22:14.025
is groaning, he's moaning, right?

421
00:22:14.325 --> 00:22:16.545
But the truth is, it's not the same thing.

422
00:22:17.405 --> 00:22:21.865
To groan, to even groan towards God is not the same thing as

423
00:22:21.865 --> 00:22:24.305
what the Bible would call grumbling.

424
00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:26.385
So if you've read the Old Testament,

425
00:22:26.385 --> 00:22:29.185
you know often God's people were judged and condemned

426
00:22:29.185 --> 00:22:32.945
because they were grumbling against Moses and Aaron

427
00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:34.185
or against God himself.

428
00:22:34.335 --> 00:22:36.505
What, what's the difference between groaning

429
00:22:36.505 --> 00:22:37.825
and grumbling in that place?

430
00:22:37.975 --> 00:22:40.225
Well, I think grumbling is a settled

431
00:22:40.415 --> 00:22:42.185
opinion and disposition.

432
00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:44.225
It's like we're talking to each other

433
00:22:44.285 --> 00:22:46.425
and saying, my mind is made up.

434
00:22:46.965 --> 00:22:49.705
I'm mad at God because he's like this.

435
00:22:50.855 --> 00:22:53.035
I'm talking about God and not to him.

436
00:22:53.975 --> 00:22:58.595
But groaning and moaning is an expression of prayer to God.

437
00:22:58.595 --> 00:23:02.115
Like, oh God, I'm hurting, I'm dying.

438
00:23:02.475 --> 00:23:07.395
I need your intervention. There's faith involved in that.

439
00:23:08.695 --> 00:23:11.155
So we do so humbly, we're not accusing God.

440
00:23:11.155 --> 00:23:13.995
It's not proud or haughty like he owes me something.

441
00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:15.715
But it's dependent.

442
00:23:15.715 --> 00:23:19.595
It's like we would say here we are desperately dependent

443
00:23:20.255 --> 00:23:22.795
on God and this is a way we can express that.

444
00:23:22.895 --> 00:23:26.435
So we cry out to God with honesty and humility.

445
00:23:26.615 --> 00:23:29.275
Our third point is that we remember

446
00:23:29.855 --> 00:23:33.755
who God has proven himself to be.

447
00:23:35.295 --> 00:23:38.155
Now the word, remember if you have this, have a Bible

448
00:23:38.295 --> 00:23:41.515
and a pen or a piece of paper, write the word remember

449
00:23:41.535 --> 00:23:44.395
and circle it in big bold colors

450
00:23:44.395 --> 00:23:47.605
because the word remember is featured

451
00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:50.285
prominently in Psalm 77.

452
00:23:50.705 --> 00:23:54.725
In fact, it's repeated in a variety of places and time.

453
00:23:54.885 --> 00:23:58.565
I think it's four or more times that it appears specifically

454
00:23:58.625 --> 00:23:59.685
as the word remember.

455
00:24:00.985 --> 00:24:04.565
And anytime you see a word like this repeated in the Bible,

456
00:24:04.835 --> 00:24:06.005
it's a good clue

457
00:24:06.465 --> 00:24:09.285
to understand what's happening in this chapter

458
00:24:09.625 --> 00:24:10.925
or what's happening in the section.

459
00:24:11.315 --> 00:24:13.805
It's a guide to know I ought to pay attention.

460
00:24:13.875 --> 00:24:15.965
This is something that I'm going to need

461
00:24:16.265 --> 00:24:17.485
to do or to think about.

462
00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:19.445
So this comes in four parts.

463
00:24:20.065 --> 00:24:23.405
And the first is that we ask genuine

464
00:24:24.005 --> 00:24:25.485
questions of God.

465
00:24:26.195 --> 00:24:29.085
It's not wrong to ask God genuine questions.

466
00:24:29.145 --> 00:24:31.645
We see the author doing this right here

467
00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:35.605
specifically I'll just read in verses seven through nine.

468
00:24:35.985 --> 00:24:40.805
As he begins to unfold his questions, he says,

469
00:24:40.975 --> 00:24:44.485
sorry, in verse five, I consider the days of old

470
00:24:45.105 --> 00:24:46.605
the years long ago.

471
00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:50.205
I said, let me remember my song in the night.

472
00:24:51.835 --> 00:24:53.415
Let me meditate in my heart.

473
00:24:53.605 --> 00:24:56.295
Then my spirit made a diligent search.

474
00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:58.935
So he is beginning to look and search

475
00:24:59.035 --> 00:25:03.615
and ask these questions, will God spur forever

476
00:25:04.715 --> 00:25:06.535
and never again be favorable?

477
00:25:07.715 --> 00:25:11.255
Has his steadfast love forever ceased?

478
00:25:12.425 --> 00:25:15.325
Are his promises at an end for all time?

479
00:25:16.385 --> 00:25:19.165
Has God forgotten to be gracious?

480
00:25:20.265 --> 00:25:23.285
Has he in anger shut up his

481
00:25:23.775 --> 00:25:25.765
compassion sayah?

482
00:25:27.265 --> 00:25:31.125
Now as you hear those questions like I do,

483
00:25:31.915 --> 00:25:35.805
what I hear is painful haunting questions.

484
00:25:37.255 --> 00:25:39.885
These are verses that can be hard to read,

485
00:25:40.555 --> 00:25:42.245
much less hard to pray.

486
00:25:42.985 --> 00:25:44.885
And some of you know what I'm talking about

487
00:25:44.885 --> 00:25:47.725
because you've asked these questions in the night,

488
00:25:48.145 --> 00:25:49.805
you may have asked them this morning,

489
00:25:50.905 --> 00:25:51.965
and these are questions

490
00:25:51.965 --> 00:25:54.725
that are haunting, challenging questions.

491
00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:57.245
And yet he lays them

492
00:25:57.245 --> 00:26:01.005
before the Lord knowing that God will hear him.

493
00:26:01.115 --> 00:26:04.525
He's not asking these hiding, he's not grumbling

494
00:26:04.545 --> 00:26:07.725
but groaning and he's asking these questions

495
00:26:07.825 --> 00:26:09.125
as he's searching his heart.

496
00:26:10.975 --> 00:26:13.675
So we begin by asking genuine questions.

497
00:26:13.775 --> 00:26:16.395
You know right here in verse 10, it's actually the end

498
00:26:16.855 --> 00:26:18.675
of this section of his asking.

499
00:26:19.735 --> 00:26:21.875
I'm reading from the English standard version,

500
00:26:21.925 --> 00:26:25.915
which I think actually doesn't translate this well in in

501
00:26:25.915 --> 00:26:27.595
verse 10 in the ESV.

502
00:26:27.595 --> 00:26:32.275
It says, then I said, I will appeal to this to the years

503
00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:34.275
of the right hand of the most high.

504
00:26:34.535 --> 00:26:35.555
And that sounds good

505
00:26:35.775 --> 00:26:39.115
and it really latches onto the rest of the chapter.

506
00:26:39.215 --> 00:26:42.395
That's where we're going is that he's going to begin

507
00:26:42.395 --> 00:26:45.645
to appeal to what he has seen and heard

508
00:26:45.705 --> 00:26:47.525
and known that God has done in the past.

509
00:26:48.465 --> 00:26:52.605
But if you are in the esv, there's a footnote that shows

510
00:26:52.605 --> 00:26:55.765
that this is translated differently when you take it

511
00:26:55.835 --> 00:26:57.485
literally in the Hebrew.

512
00:26:57.625 --> 00:26:59.685
And so if you're reading the New American standard version

513
00:27:00.225 --> 00:27:01.965
or the Christian Standard Bible,

514
00:27:02.385 --> 00:27:06.285
or almost any other translation takes it this way, it says,

515
00:27:06.835 --> 00:27:11.705
this is my grief that the right hand

516
00:27:11.885 --> 00:27:15.105
of the most high has changed.

517
00:27:19.615 --> 00:27:22.795
Now I understand why a translator would not really like

518
00:27:22.795 --> 00:27:24.555
to put that in print

519
00:27:26.295 --> 00:27:30.985
because the entire Bible tells us clearly that God

520
00:27:32.355 --> 00:27:35.985
never changes, God does not change.

521
00:27:37.095 --> 00:27:40.345
Amen. So why does the Bible say

522
00:27:40.565 --> 00:27:42.675
God changes?

523
00:27:43.575 --> 00:27:46.275
He says, this is the thing that is my grief.

524
00:27:48.095 --> 00:27:50.185
What he's not saying is that God has changed

525
00:27:50.685 --> 00:27:53.105
or that God would ever change.

526
00:27:53.245 --> 00:27:57.865
But what he's describing is the temporary eclipse

527
00:27:58.245 --> 00:28:00.105
of his soul that he's experiencing.

528
00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:03.265
He feels like God has changed.

529
00:28:05.645 --> 00:28:08.865
And if you can relate to that feeling, then you know exactly

530
00:28:08.935 --> 00:28:09.945
what he's talking about.

531
00:28:10.615 --> 00:28:12.425
That feels bad, right?

532
00:28:12.895 --> 00:28:15.705
Like these are, this guy is a follower

533
00:28:15.965 --> 00:28:20.945
of the Lord God Almighty, just as we are the followers

534
00:28:20.945 --> 00:28:22.465
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

535
00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:26.175
Even as you walk with God and trust him

536
00:28:26.175 --> 00:28:27.935
and follow him, you can have moments

537
00:28:28.025 --> 00:28:29.775
where you feel like this.

538
00:28:30.555 --> 00:28:34.655
And if you feel like that, I guarantee you that

539
00:28:35.395 --> 00:28:36.695
is a grief.

540
00:28:38.495 --> 00:28:41.395
And so he's asking genuine questions.

541
00:28:41.585 --> 00:28:45.195
He's expressing them, being honest and humble.

542
00:28:45.525 --> 00:28:47.715
Which brings us to our next point, which is this,

543
00:28:48.005 --> 00:28:50.275
which is really the major, some of the major

544
00:28:51.115 --> 00:28:54.235
features here is that we are to remember things we're

545
00:28:54.235 --> 00:28:55.715
to remember about God.

546
00:28:55.895 --> 00:28:57.995
And the first is that we remember God's

547
00:28:58.315 --> 00:29:01.395
faithfulness in our past.

548
00:29:01.955 --> 00:29:06.275
Remember God's faithfulness in your past, read again, uh,

549
00:29:06.375 --> 00:29:09.635
verses five and six kind of sets this up.

550
00:29:10.055 --> 00:29:13.355
He says, I consider the days of old the years long ago.

551
00:29:13.475 --> 00:29:16.315
I said, let me remember my song in the night.

552
00:29:17.215 --> 00:29:18.835
Let me meditate in my heart.

553
00:29:19.295 --> 00:29:22.315
And so he's calling to mind in his own experience.

554
00:29:22.435 --> 00:29:26.155
I think times when he didn't feel like this, he's like, Hey,

555
00:29:26.155 --> 00:29:27.555
there was a time I didn't feel like this.

556
00:29:27.645 --> 00:29:29.195
There was a time the sun was out

557
00:29:29.195 --> 00:29:31.315
and there wasn't this eclipse in my life.

558
00:29:31.655 --> 00:29:34.595
And so he's remembering that it doesn't necessarily fix him,

559
00:29:35.015 --> 00:29:37.675
but it does put him on the right path.

560
00:29:38.015 --> 00:29:42.325
And then this is our next point. Do not wait to worship.

561
00:29:43.345 --> 00:29:45.565
So often we're governed by our feelings

562
00:29:45.565 --> 00:29:46.645
and our circumstances.

563
00:29:47.415 --> 00:29:49.725
We're like, I worship God when I feel better.

564
00:29:50.905 --> 00:29:55.725
But at the end, what we see here is Asaf begins here calling

565
00:29:55.785 --> 00:29:57.045
to mind the goodness of God

566
00:29:57.645 --> 00:29:59.245
entering into a posture of worship.

567
00:29:59.745 --> 00:30:04.405
Two Corinthians five, chapter seven says, we walk by faith

568
00:30:04.865 --> 00:30:06.005
and not by sight.

569
00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:09.605
That means we live the Christian life by faith in the Son

570
00:30:09.605 --> 00:30:12.685
of God, not by our temporary experiences.

571
00:30:13.665 --> 00:30:16.885
In this context, we think about the Lord Jesus when he was

572
00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:20.645
tempted and tested in the wilderness fasting

573
00:30:20.645 --> 00:30:22.485
for 40 days and 40 nights.

574
00:30:22.505 --> 00:30:23.765
And the enemy came to him

575
00:30:24.025 --> 00:30:26.405
and tempted him, he said, man doesn't live

576
00:30:26.425 --> 00:30:28.005
by bread alone, but what?

577
00:30:29.165 --> 00:30:33.065
By every word that comes from the mouth of God.

578
00:30:33.885 --> 00:30:36.705
In this context we might say, man doesn't live

579
00:30:36.765 --> 00:30:38.545
by feelings alone.

580
00:30:39.005 --> 00:30:41.425
We don't live the Christian life based on how we feel,

581
00:30:42.045 --> 00:30:44.865
but we live it based on the fixed facts

582
00:30:44.965 --> 00:30:48.865
and realities of who God is based on his eternal word.

583
00:30:48.955 --> 00:30:50.785
Maybe you're familiar with the old illustration

584
00:30:50.805 --> 00:30:53.345
of our lives being like a freight train

585
00:30:54.075 --> 00:30:58.505
where the engine pulling the train is faith based on facts

586
00:30:59.645 --> 00:31:01.145
and our feelings matter.

587
00:31:01.145 --> 00:31:03.385
They're just way back in the caboose.

588
00:31:03.405 --> 00:31:05.705
And as the train is making progress,

589
00:31:05.965 --> 00:31:08.345
the feelings always come along.

590
00:31:09.125 --> 00:31:11.305
But so often we want them backwards.

591
00:31:11.395 --> 00:31:14.865
We're like, when I feel it, I'll get the engine going.

592
00:31:16.005 --> 00:31:19.695
So don't wait to worship. You may not feel better.

593
00:31:21.535 --> 00:31:23.875
You know, we have this thing called your final illness.

594
00:31:24.785 --> 00:31:26.355
I've seen it on a death certificate.

595
00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:28.315
It's the last thing that's gonna get me.

596
00:31:29.095 --> 00:31:33.315
And so there's a day in which the darkness won't lift

597
00:31:33.855 --> 00:31:37.475
and we will then us be ushered into the immediate presence

598
00:31:37.475 --> 00:31:40.555
of God where it all goes away for eternity.

599
00:31:41.655 --> 00:31:44.435
And so there's ways in which moments in which there's

600
00:31:44.675 --> 00:31:46.795
darkness that we won't temporarily overcome,

601
00:31:47.535 --> 00:31:49.275
but God always will.

602
00:31:49.535 --> 00:31:52.595
We need to remember, don't wait to worship.

603
00:31:53.455 --> 00:31:55.915
Our next point is that we remember again

604
00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:58.515
what is true about God.

605
00:31:59.345 --> 00:32:01.635
This is what ASF is about to do.

606
00:32:02.135 --> 00:32:03.755
And he goes far beyond his own limited

607
00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:05.035
thoughts and experience.

608
00:32:05.335 --> 00:32:07.155
Uh, the questions from verses seven

609
00:32:07.175 --> 00:32:08.435
to nine that he just ran through.

610
00:32:08.505 --> 00:32:12.115
What we see is these become rhetorical questions.

611
00:32:12.465 --> 00:32:15.275
They sort of get turned on his, on their head.

612
00:32:15.465 --> 00:32:16.635
This is how he feels.

613
00:32:17.175 --> 00:32:20.515
But he begins to realize that they have good answers.

614
00:32:21.545 --> 00:32:23.355
When he asks the questions, he begins

615
00:32:23.355 --> 00:32:24.475
to hear them coming back.

616
00:32:24.935 --> 00:32:28.835
In truth, God will never spur forever.

617
00:32:30.665 --> 00:32:32.765
He will again be favorable.

618
00:32:32.805 --> 00:32:36.565
Lamentations three, his steadfast love will never cease.

619
00:32:37.585 --> 00:32:39.205
His promises last forever.

620
00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:42.845
His compassion is alive and well and will never forget.

621
00:32:43.185 --> 00:32:45.525
He will always be gracious.

622
00:32:45.625 --> 00:32:49.565
So we are called to remember these truths, to hold them,

623
00:32:49.665 --> 00:32:51.325
to teach them to ourselves

624
00:32:51.385 --> 00:32:53.565
and to one another, to preach them to ourselves.

625
00:32:53.625 --> 00:32:57.645
We base our faith on fixed, settled, eternal truth,

626
00:32:57.775 --> 00:32:59.525
facts and reality.

627
00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:03.885
It's what pilots refer to as flying by the instruments.

628
00:33:04.665 --> 00:33:07.805
So if a pilot is flying a plane through a cloud or a fog

629
00:33:07.865 --> 00:33:12.205
or say at night and there's no light, it's actually possible

630
00:33:12.205 --> 00:33:15.405
to be flying downward while feeling like

631
00:33:15.865 --> 00:33:17.045
you're leveling off.

632
00:33:17.865 --> 00:33:20.525
And and that's just a disaster waiting to happen.

633
00:33:20.985 --> 00:33:23.405
But if a pilot flies by the instruments,

634
00:33:23.465 --> 00:33:26.445
the instrument panel will tell him which way is up

635
00:33:26.445 --> 00:33:28.085
or down and so forth.

636
00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:29.965
So we fly by the instruments

637
00:33:30.395 --> 00:33:33.845
because our visual cues, our, our experience

638
00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:38.565
of reality can be skewed spiritually.

639
00:33:38.845 --> 00:33:41.365
Speaking here is just kind of the burden of

640
00:33:41.515 --> 00:33:43.405
what I wanna say this morning.

641
00:33:43.545 --> 00:33:46.565
If you hear nothing else, I really wanna make this point.

642
00:33:48.225 --> 00:33:51.515
This kind of faith that's fixed on eternal facts

643
00:33:52.785 --> 00:33:54.875
that will carry you in life.

644
00:33:55.185 --> 00:33:57.635
Whether you're in trouble in trial

645
00:33:57.855 --> 00:34:02.435
or not, you will never be able to do this.

646
00:34:02.535 --> 00:34:04.435
If you do not know your Bible,

647
00:34:06.375 --> 00:34:10.805
like it is impossible for you to fly

648
00:34:10.905 --> 00:34:15.495
by the instrument of God's word when you can't see

649
00:34:15.635 --> 00:34:17.975
or sense reality, well,

650
00:34:18.915 --> 00:34:20.855
you will never be able to do that.

651
00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:23.775
Well if you do not know the Bible

652
00:34:25.055 --> 00:34:26.315
and you say, you might say,

653
00:34:26.315 --> 00:34:28.315
well the Bible's a big book, right?

654
00:34:28.315 --> 00:34:30.955
Have you looked at it? I mean if I look here, this one,

655
00:34:30.955 --> 00:34:35.215
it's got like thousands of pages.

656
00:34:35.445 --> 00:34:38.735
What are we at? 1500 plus, right?

657
00:34:39.435 --> 00:34:43.815
So what that means is that there's a lot of reading to do.

658
00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:46.935
Uh, but the truth is, I,

659
00:34:46.955 --> 00:34:50.175
if you're granted much time on earth, you've got a lot

660
00:34:50.175 --> 00:34:51.455
of time to read it.

661
00:34:51.955 --> 00:34:54.735
And so that's the beauty of this uh,

662
00:34:55.245 --> 00:34:56.895
Asaf right here in this chapter.

663
00:34:56.995 --> 00:35:00.415
He begins recalling, remembering, reciting

664
00:35:00.415 --> 00:35:03.135
to himself the words of the Bible.

665
00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:05.495
You know, Jesus was quoting the Bible,

666
00:35:05.675 --> 00:35:08.055
he was quoting from Deuteronomy chapter eight,

667
00:35:08.215 --> 00:35:11.415
I believe it was whenever he said, we don't live by uh,

668
00:35:11.905 --> 00:35:14.455
bread alone, but by every word from the mouth of God.

669
00:35:14.675 --> 00:35:17.415
If Jesus Christ needed to know

670
00:35:17.635 --> 00:35:20.775
and to quote the Bible, how much more do you

671
00:35:20.775 --> 00:35:23.935
and I need to meditate on God's word.

672
00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:27.175
So we must consume God's word.

673
00:35:27.515 --> 00:35:29.455
We live in a consumer society

674
00:35:29.515 --> 00:35:32.375
and we're always like, oh, we don't wanna be consumers,

675
00:35:32.485 --> 00:35:36.095
okay, but we want to be consumers of God's word.

676
00:35:37.105 --> 00:35:40.405
We want to consume it like our life depends on it.

677
00:35:40.405 --> 00:35:42.405
That means read it and know it.

678
00:35:43.815 --> 00:35:48.515
If not, you're going to be, you will be malnourished,

679
00:35:49.345 --> 00:35:50.995
stunted and hindered.

680
00:35:51.495 --> 00:35:53.955
You'll be if you, your spirit's like a body,

681
00:35:53.965 --> 00:35:55.515
you'd be starving.

682
00:35:56.895 --> 00:35:59.235
And it's hard to do anything well with that.

683
00:35:59.255 --> 00:36:02.155
So with God's word, you can feed your soul

684
00:36:02.495 --> 00:36:04.315
and that fuels your faith.

685
00:36:04.935 --> 00:36:06.435
Romans 15, four says,

686
00:36:06.575 --> 00:36:10.435
for whatever was written in former days, including Psalm 77,

687
00:36:11.785 --> 00:36:15.955
this was written for our instruction that through endurance

688
00:36:16.535 --> 00:36:19.755
and through the encouragement of the scriptures, we might

689
00:36:20.265 --> 00:36:21.275
have hope.

690
00:36:21.855 --> 00:36:26.515
So read God's word. Listen to God's word.

691
00:36:27.005 --> 00:36:28.675
Learn God's word.

692
00:36:29.355 --> 00:36:32.795
Memorize God's word, become familiar with God's word.

693
00:36:33.045 --> 00:36:36.075
Spend your whole life. It's like a lifelong pursuit

694
00:36:37.095 --> 00:36:40.795
of getting acquainted with familiar with God's word.

695
00:36:40.795 --> 00:36:42.555
And you say, well, I read and I don't remember everything.

696
00:36:42.835 --> 00:36:45.115
I listen and it doesn't all sink in fine.

697
00:36:45.935 --> 00:36:47.195
We do that with everything else.

698
00:36:47.335 --> 00:36:50.555
So just start with God's word. Let it wash over you.

699
00:36:50.855 --> 00:36:54.275
Let it seed and fertilize and season your mind

700
00:36:55.015 --> 00:36:56.115
and you will find it.

701
00:36:56.395 --> 00:36:59.995
Strengthening, encouraging, helping you everywhere you go,

702
00:37:00.125 --> 00:37:01.315
every trial you face.

703
00:37:04.115 --> 00:37:06.655
In verse 11, ASAP turns the corner here.

704
00:37:07.035 --> 00:37:11.495
And um, and we read this as he continues, I will

705
00:37:12.215 --> 00:37:13.615
remember the deeds of the Lord.

706
00:37:13.715 --> 00:37:16.695
Yes, I will remember your wonders of old.

707
00:37:17.055 --> 00:37:18.775
I will ponder all of your work

708
00:37:18.835 --> 00:37:21.415
and meditate on your mighty deeds your way.

709
00:37:21.435 --> 00:37:24.655
Oh God is holy. What? God is great like our God.

710
00:37:24.995 --> 00:37:26.855
You are the God who works wonders.

711
00:37:27.235 --> 00:37:30.735
You have made known your might among the peoples.

712
00:37:31.075 --> 00:37:33.855
You with your arm redeemed your people, the children

713
00:37:34.315 --> 00:37:37.095
of Jacob and of Joseph Sayah.

714
00:37:40.155 --> 00:37:42.975
Listen to his holy resolve, his holy determination.

715
00:37:43.255 --> 00:37:47.215
I will remember I love this quote by John Piper.

716
00:37:47.215 --> 00:37:51.095
He says, we have to fight for our delight in God.

717
00:37:53.225 --> 00:37:55.165
We tend to take our negative circumstances

718
00:37:55.585 --> 00:37:57.245
and super impose them on God.

719
00:37:57.245 --> 00:38:01.125
We interpret God based on our experiences rather than

720
00:38:01.125 --> 00:38:04.525
looking at God and interpreting our experiences in light

721
00:38:04.525 --> 00:38:06.845
of him and his eternal reality.

722
00:38:06.945 --> 00:38:09.965
But here are the psalmist calls to mind the exodus

723
00:38:10.095 --> 00:38:13.085
where the Israelites were pressed up against the sea.

724
00:38:13.195 --> 00:38:15.085
They had their enemies on the one hand

725
00:38:15.265 --> 00:38:17.125
and they had the ocean on the other.

726
00:38:17.415 --> 00:38:22.265
There was no way out they could drown on the one hand

727
00:38:22.325 --> 00:38:24.025
or be killed or enslaved on the other.

728
00:38:24.245 --> 00:38:27.425
And what happened, not only did God stand between them

729
00:38:27.485 --> 00:38:29.825
and the enemy and he hemmed them in,

730
00:38:30.245 --> 00:38:31.905
but he did the unexpected.

731
00:38:32.035 --> 00:38:35.605
There was no way out, but he delivered them.

732
00:38:35.785 --> 00:38:40.205
He made a way by carving a path through the water

733
00:38:40.585 --> 00:38:42.445
and he led them through on dry ground.

734
00:38:42.585 --> 00:38:44.805
And then when the Egyptians pursued them,

735
00:38:45.025 --> 00:38:47.805
the waters descended in a storm and a flood

736
00:38:47.985 --> 00:38:49.765
and wiped out all their enemies.

737
00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:50.925
Problem solved.

738
00:38:52.925 --> 00:38:54.585
And this is one of the great

739
00:38:55.485 --> 00:38:58.225
and awesome stories of the Bible that

740
00:38:58.785 --> 00:39:01.705
resounds throughout both the old and the New Testament.

741
00:39:02.685 --> 00:39:05.785
And he recounts it here at the end of verses 16 to the end.

742
00:39:06.095 --> 00:39:08.225
When the waters saw you, oh God,

743
00:39:08.775 --> 00:39:10.865
when the waters saw you, they were afraid.

744
00:39:10.965 --> 00:39:14.505
Indeed, the deep tremble, the inanimate objects,

745
00:39:14.505 --> 00:39:16.385
they responded to God.

746
00:39:18.245 --> 00:39:21.345
The clouds poured out water, the skies gave forth thunder.

747
00:39:21.575 --> 00:39:23.705
Your arrows flashed on every side.

748
00:39:23.725 --> 00:39:26.585
The crash of your thunder was in the world.

749
00:39:26.585 --> 00:39:30.305
When your lightings lighted up the world, the earth tremble

750
00:39:30.305 --> 00:39:33.905
and shook your way was through the sea, your path

751
00:39:33.905 --> 00:39:35.305
through the great waters.

752
00:39:35.805 --> 00:39:38.225
Yet your footsteps were unseen.

753
00:39:39.045 --> 00:39:41.625
You led your people like a flock by the hand

754
00:39:42.205 --> 00:39:43.785
of Moses and Aaron.

755
00:39:45.155 --> 00:39:47.895
You see the creation power of God on display.

756
00:39:47.995 --> 00:39:50.575
You see his tender care like a shepherd.

757
00:39:51.165 --> 00:39:53.735
Even when all that could be seen was the enemy

758
00:39:53.735 --> 00:39:55.055
and the water and the storm.

759
00:39:56.345 --> 00:39:59.015
God's footsteps were unseen.

760
00:39:59.985 --> 00:40:03.215
God's right hand that seemed hard to see

761
00:40:03.915 --> 00:40:05.055
was still invisible,

762
00:40:05.195 --> 00:40:07.375
but the results became visible

763
00:40:07.515 --> 00:40:11.655
as they were delivered from their impossible situation.

764
00:40:13.045 --> 00:40:15.945
And in this we see not only do we see that today,

765
00:40:15.965 --> 00:40:16.985
we can call that to mind.

766
00:40:17.305 --> 00:40:19.385
I remember we can, when you read God's word,

767
00:40:19.385 --> 00:40:22.385
you can remember the thousands of way God has intervened

768
00:40:22.765 --> 00:40:24.185
to save and rescue his people.

769
00:40:24.245 --> 00:40:27.705
But more than anything we have more than that.

770
00:40:28.235 --> 00:40:31.945
There is the foreshadowing of the exodus story

771
00:40:32.375 --> 00:40:35.945
that is carried out in the life and death

772
00:40:36.285 --> 00:40:39.065
and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ,

773
00:40:39.595 --> 00:40:42.425
where the whole world was subject to sin

774
00:40:42.445 --> 00:40:46.865
and rebellion against God, enslaved to sin and death.

775
00:40:47.165 --> 00:40:49.505
The Lord Jesus Christ, bit heaven and earth.

776
00:40:49.965 --> 00:40:52.665
And he lived a perfect sinless life, something that you

777
00:40:52.665 --> 00:40:53.665
and I could never do.

778
00:40:54.085 --> 00:40:56.345
He died as a substitute in our place.

779
00:40:56.605 --> 00:40:59.825
And then he rose again victorious over death hell in the

780
00:40:59.825 --> 00:41:03.825
grave so that we might be made new as we trust in him

781
00:41:04.285 --> 00:41:06.345
and that we might be with him forever.

782
00:41:06.375 --> 00:41:11.145
Because Jesus Christ is the new and the better exodus.

783
00:41:11.515 --> 00:41:14.785
Jesus Christ is the new and the better. Moses.

784
00:41:15.605 --> 00:41:19.585
And we see this here being echoed in Psalm 77.

785
00:41:20.815 --> 00:41:22.795
I'm about out of time. So let me do this quickly.

786
00:41:23.215 --> 00:41:27.315
Our fourth point is this, that we need to rest in the Lord

787
00:41:27.575 --> 00:41:29.995
who loves and leads you.

788
00:41:30.185 --> 00:41:33.365
Matthew 1128 says, come to me all who labor

789
00:41:33.705 --> 00:41:37.245
and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.

790
00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:41.085
Take my yoke upon you, learn from me, for I am gentle

791
00:41:41.505 --> 00:41:42.565
and lowly in heart.

792
00:41:42.565 --> 00:41:46.365
And you will find rest for your soul.

793
00:41:48.455 --> 00:41:51.675
Our fifth and final point is this, that you should remember

794
00:41:51.985 --> 00:41:54.875
that it's not all about you.

795
00:41:55.895 --> 00:41:58.755
The trials and troubles that come your way, they affect you.

796
00:41:59.305 --> 00:42:01.075
There's a way in which it's about you,

797
00:42:01.175 --> 00:42:04.755
but God is doing more than you can see or imagine.

798
00:42:05.215 --> 00:42:07.715
And we need to remember He's doing something in us

799
00:42:08.215 --> 00:42:13.075
and through us, an eternity will tell that story.

800
00:42:13.735 --> 00:42:17.635
So in conclusion, sometimes our circumstances don't change

801
00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:18.995
even when we cry out to God.

802
00:42:19.215 --> 00:42:22.515
But what happens is that we change in the process.

803
00:42:23.755 --> 00:42:25.595
Spiritual eclipses in our lives can be temporary,

804
00:42:26.305 --> 00:42:29.555
localized experiences, but they strengthen us

805
00:42:30.015 --> 00:42:32.315
and they stretch us and they grow our faith

806
00:42:33.785 --> 00:42:35.195
like a good biblical lament.

807
00:42:35.215 --> 00:42:38.235
We start where we are, but we're going somewhere.

808
00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:44.305
And so that is God's word for us this morning.

809
00:42:44.405 --> 00:42:47.145
So let me, I'd like to close in this way.

810
00:42:47.745 --> 00:42:50.345
I mentioned this earlier, lamentation chapter three,

811
00:42:51.045 --> 00:42:54.265
and I'd like to read this responsibly actually as we end.

812
00:42:54.645 --> 00:42:56.705
So if you would do this with me, I would invite you

813
00:42:56.705 --> 00:42:57.745
to actually please stand.

814
00:42:59.875 --> 00:43:02.545
We're going to, I don't know if you're familiar

815
00:43:02.545 --> 00:43:06.065
with lamentation three, uh, this portion of scripture.

816
00:43:06.365 --> 00:43:08.665
Uh, if not, I would encourage you to memorize it,

817
00:43:09.165 --> 00:43:10.985
to read it, sing it, pray it.

818
00:43:11.605 --> 00:43:14.825
But lamentation chapter three, verses 21 to 26.

819
00:43:15.325 --> 00:43:16.825
I'd like to read this responsibly.

820
00:43:16.895 --> 00:43:17.905
I'll read first

821
00:43:17.965 --> 00:43:21.785
and then if you would read, um, the next line.

822
00:43:22.825 --> 00:43:26.695
God's word says this, this I call to mind and

823
00:43:26.695 --> 00:43:28.295
therefore, I have hope

824
00:43:29.815 --> 00:43:30.815
Today. I love

825
00:43:30.815 --> 00:43:31.565
the Lord.

826
00:43:33.395 --> 00:43:35.445
Good job. Just say it like you mean it.

827
00:43:36.145 --> 00:43:38.805
His mercies never come to an end

828
00:43:41.655 --> 00:43:42.925
Crate is your faithfulness.

829
00:43:44.065 --> 00:43:46.605
The Lord Is my worship, my

830
00:43:46.605 --> 00:43:47.605
Soul. Therefore,

831
00:43:47.605 --> 00:43:49.445
I will hope in him.

832
00:43:50.505 --> 00:43:51.605
The Lord is Good.

833
00:43:53.905 --> 00:43:55.765
To the soul who seeks him in truth

834
00:43:56.785 --> 00:43:57.785
Is good. Wait

835
00:43:57.785 --> 00:44:00.245
rightly for salvation of Lord.
