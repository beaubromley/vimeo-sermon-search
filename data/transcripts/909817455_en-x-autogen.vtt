1
00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:52.405
Grace and peace to you this morning.

2
00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:54.325
Church, it's great to see you.

3
00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:56.645
If you're new with us, we're so glad that you're here.

4
00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:59.485
Uh, we know it's a big deal to take that step

5
00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:00.645
and so we'd love to get to meet you

6
00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:01.845
and get to know you if we can.

7
00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:04.885
So, um, there's a QR code in front of you if you can do

8
00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:06.565
that, or there's a new area out there.

9
00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:10.365
We'd love to just to, to bless you as you've blessed us

10
00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:12.205
with your presence here today.

11
00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:15.325
Uh, by the way, there, there's been a lot of new people

12
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.485
around here these last couple weeks and,

13
00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:21.165
and so if this is your home already,

14
00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:23.445
if you're consider yourself a Henderson Hills person,

15
00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:28.525
make it your mission to welcome everyone every week.

16
00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:29.965
Like that could be your job.

17
00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:32.965
Uh, my job, every one of us as best we can.

18
00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:35.445
Uh, but also if you could make it a point,

19
00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:38.165
I know nobody loves sitting on the front row except

20
00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:40.125
for a few of you, but if you could sit forward

21
00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:44.805
and inward, uh, our new friends often like, look for seats,

22
00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:46.165
kind of easy to find.

23
00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:48.005
And those are the edges and the backs.

24
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.845
And so just make it a, a thought process as you come in.

25
00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:53.205
Say, may I sit a little forward and in

26
00:01:53.205 --> 00:01:56.205
and let those seats be found easier for people

27
00:01:56.205 --> 00:01:57.805
who might be coming in a little bit later.

28
00:01:58.575 --> 00:02:00.285
Let's not make it harder for people

29
00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:03.125
to feel like this is home, uh, like this is family.

30
00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.765
So let's make it our priority for that.

31
00:02:06.505 --> 00:02:09.525
So we're currently walking through this first things first

32
00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:12.605
series where we're studying the most important doctrines

33
00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:14.245
of our faith first.

34
00:02:14.985 --> 00:02:18.005
Uh, later we'll shift to the less important doctrines, kind

35
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.765
of show how that fits in around the big rocks.

36
00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:23.005
But, but we're just gonna review regularly

37
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:24.165
just so we get them in our heads.

38
00:02:24.195 --> 00:02:26.645
What are the things not, again, it's not exhaustive,

39
00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:29.845
but these are seven that we're saying are the big rocks.

40
00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:32.445
And so the first one, a few weeks ago now,

41
00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:34.085
what was the first one that we looked at?

42
00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:37.165
Revelation. Revelation. Okay, we're catching on.

43
00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:39.085
We're picking up. All right. Revelation is

44
00:02:39.085 --> 00:02:40.925
that God has told us about himself.

45
00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:43.285
Otherwise we wouldn't know very much about God.

46
00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:45.925
This is the first one God told us about himself.

47
00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:49.325
Second was what he told us about himself. What was that?

48
00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:54.085
God's attributes. What God is, who God is.

49
00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:57.445
We wanted to make sure we understood that as we go.

50
00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:00.885
Now the third rock, which I probably should have done,

51
00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:02.605
the biggest rock for this one,

52
00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:04.325
but uh, the third one was,

53
00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:08.565
what did God tell us about himself, specifically Trinity,

54
00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:13.205
that God is three persons, one God, same divine essence.

55
00:03:13.915 --> 00:03:16.685
That is one of the most distinguishing

56
00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:18.405
marks of Christianity.

57
00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:21.645
Well then we added a fourth one last week

58
00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:26.525
and it was what God, the Son, the incarnation that

59
00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:31.005
God has added on a human nature to save us,

60
00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.445
to become like us so we could be like him.

61
00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:37.845
Now, so far all of our big rocks have focused on God.

62
00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:40.285
They've been directed vertically.

63
00:03:40.545 --> 00:03:44.445
And today we're gonna shift our eyes a little bit to try

64
00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:46.965
to answer some of the most foundational questions

65
00:03:46.965 --> 00:03:51.325
that people have about life, about life in general.

66
00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:54.285
See, probably more than any time in history,

67
00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:58.285
people are asking questions about identity,

68
00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:03.885
about trying to figure out who they are, why they exist.

69
00:04:05.035 --> 00:04:06.645
It's rampant.

70
00:04:08.295 --> 00:04:11.475
And students, you're pressed up against this every single

71
00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:14.195
day as influencers

72
00:04:14.215 --> 00:04:16.915
and even friends select

73
00:04:17.335 --> 00:04:21.555
and modify their identity, who they claim to be.

74
00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:25.875
But in reality, it's every single one

75
00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:28.155
of us is facing this every day.

76
00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:31.235
Just think about how people cultivate their

77
00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:32.635
image on social media.

78
00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:36.595
Only putting forward the best parts of who I am.

79
00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:38.555
And, and this is what I want you to know about me,

80
00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:40.275
but I don't want you to know really who I am.

81
00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:43.685
And then you add to that,

82
00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:47.845
this constant pull toward finding our identity in a

83
00:04:47.845 --> 00:04:48.885
political outcome

84
00:04:50.825 --> 00:04:54.885
or a sports team or a job

85
00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:57.685
or a financial status that we have versus other.

86
00:04:57.685 --> 00:05:00.565
That's we are all tempted to find identity

87
00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:03.585
in those things and many more.

88
00:05:03.885 --> 00:05:07.385
That's why our big rock today will examine

89
00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:10.505
what God's word says about humanity,

90
00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:14.825
about mankind, humans,

91
00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:18.065
this is essential.

92
00:05:18.245 --> 00:05:19.585
Now the question you might ask like

93
00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:20.705
why is that a foundational rock?

94
00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:22.545
It's not about God. Well, it's about us.

95
00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:24.305
Yes, because if we don't get this right,

96
00:05:25.405 --> 00:05:28.105
we won't understand our relationship with God.

97
00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:32.025
First. We won't understand salvation.

98
00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:35.905
In essence, we'll start looking

99
00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:38.185
for identity in all these wrong places

100
00:05:40.905 --> 00:05:42.685
and we'll treat each other very wrongly.

101
00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:46.365
That's why this is foundational.

102
00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:50.085
So it's gonna be a bit of a roundabout journey,

103
00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:53.445
but we're gonna start in James chapter three

104
00:05:53.745 --> 00:05:54.765
to get us down the road

105
00:05:54.865 --> 00:05:57.165
to understanding humanity a little bit better.

106
00:05:58.345 --> 00:06:01.165
And so turn to James three with me in God's Word

107
00:06:02.065 --> 00:06:03.205
all the way in the New Testament.

108
00:06:03.205 --> 00:06:07.885
Later in there New Testament John, uh, sorry,

109
00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:09.085
James chapter three.

110
00:06:10.145 --> 00:06:12.285
And we're gonna look at James three, one through 12

111
00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:14.205
and we're gonna see what the Holy Spirit inspired James

112
00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:17.245
to write about our words.

113
00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:22.725
See how this gets us down the road with humanity as we go.

114
00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:26.245
James three, one through 12.

115
00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:33.185
Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers,

116
00:06:33.565 --> 00:06:35.865
for you know that we who teach will be judged

117
00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:39.705
with greater strictness for we all stumble in many ways.

118
00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:42.065
And if anyone does not stumble in what he says,

119
00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:46.265
he's a perfect man able to also bridle his whole body.

120
00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:48.785
If we put bits in the mouse of horses.

121
00:06:48.885 --> 00:06:51.545
So they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.

122
00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:55.785
Look at the ships also though they're so large driven

123
00:06:55.845 --> 00:06:58.985
by strong winds, they're guided by a very small rudder

124
00:06:59.705 --> 00:07:01.145
wherever the will the pilot directs.

125
00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:04.865
So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts

126
00:07:04.885 --> 00:07:09.105
of great things, how great a forest is set a blaze

127
00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:10.345
by such a small fire.

128
00:07:10.405 --> 00:07:14.065
And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness.

129
00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:16.705
The tongue is set among our members,

130
00:07:16.745 --> 00:07:19.265
staining the whole body, setting on fire.

131
00:07:19.325 --> 00:07:24.075
The entire course of life set on fire by hell for every kind

132
00:07:24.075 --> 00:07:25.595
of beast and bird of reptile

133
00:07:25.595 --> 00:07:29.275
and sea creature can be tamed, has been tamed by mankind,

134
00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:32.635
but no human being can tame the tongue.

135
00:07:33.945 --> 00:07:36.075
It's a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

136
00:07:36.945 --> 00:07:38.795
With it, we bless our Lord and Father

137
00:07:38.815 --> 00:07:41.235
and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness

138
00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:44.665
of God from the same mouth come blessing

139
00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:46.345
and cursing my brothers.

140
00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:47.585
These things ought not to be.

141
00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:52.175
So does a spring pour forth from the same opening both

142
00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:53.495
fresh and salt water?

143
00:07:53.955 --> 00:07:56.095
Can a fig tree my brothers bear olives

144
00:07:56.195 --> 00:07:58.015
or a grapevine produce figs?

145
00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:02.215
Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.

146
00:08:04.675 --> 00:08:05.695
God, this is your word.

147
00:08:06.915 --> 00:08:09.415
We pray that you would show us what you want us

148
00:08:09.415 --> 00:08:12.135
to see here very clearly that this would not be something

149
00:08:12.135 --> 00:08:15.895
that we, as James says earlier, merely hear.

150
00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:19.075
But we actually do not just be here is

151
00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:20.155
the word but doers of the word.

152
00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:21.915
And we know we can't do that as we just saw.

153
00:08:21.975 --> 00:08:24.795
We can't tame our tongues. We can't do this ourselves.

154
00:08:24.975 --> 00:08:29.475
God, we need your work, your change in us. So start with me.

155
00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:34.115
Start with us that we would walk towards you in holiness,

156
00:08:34.935 --> 00:08:38.155
in your power for your glory, for others good

157
00:08:39.655 --> 00:08:41.035
in Jesus' name, help us.

158
00:08:42.145 --> 00:08:46.835
Amen. So I wanna walk briefly through this passage

159
00:08:47.095 --> 00:08:48.835
to show first how James teaches

160
00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:49.995
what he's talking about here,

161
00:08:50.015 --> 00:08:53.475
but then also what it'll springboard us into a discussion on

162
00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:55.565
humanity and all the things we talked about here.

163
00:08:56.345 --> 00:08:59.605
And so he started notice with a, a passage on

164
00:09:00.245 --> 00:09:01.805
teachers in which he includes himself.

165
00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:04.085
He says, we who teach will be judged

166
00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:05.405
with greater strictness.

167
00:09:06.065 --> 00:09:07.765
Now why is it true that teachers are

168
00:09:07.765 --> 00:09:09.005
judged with greater strictness?

169
00:09:09.205 --> 00:09:11.565
'cause we who teach are instructing others.

170
00:09:11.595 --> 00:09:14.485
He's talking not just teachers in general in the faith,

171
00:09:15.365 --> 00:09:17.245
teachers of the faith, people who are teaching about

172
00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:20.805
who God is, who're leading through our teaching,

173
00:09:20.995 --> 00:09:23.685
whoever's teaching, helping direct lives,

174
00:09:23.875 --> 00:09:25.845
answering questions and so on.

175
00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:27.645
That's why this is such a big deal.

176
00:09:27.665 --> 00:09:31.325
And so James' point saying, you better be careful with

177
00:09:31.325 --> 00:09:33.645
what you say as a teacher.

178
00:09:36.305 --> 00:09:38.085
And he says, why? Because verse two says,

179
00:09:38.085 --> 00:09:40.605
we all stumble in many ways with even our words.

180
00:09:41.625 --> 00:09:43.725
We all get off track even as teachers,

181
00:09:43.785 --> 00:09:46.885
we can lead people astray by us getting astray.

182
00:09:49.525 --> 00:09:51.465
And he gives us a couple of great illustrations

183
00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:53.945
to prove his point about this idea of the tongue.

184
00:09:54.875 --> 00:09:59.465
First he uses this idea of a bit in the mouth of a horse.

185
00:10:01.005 --> 00:10:03.905
Now a bit is a small piece of metal you put in their mouth

186
00:10:03.925 --> 00:10:05.305
and it's got a ring on each end of it.

187
00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:08.985
And it connects to the straps that the rider holds in order

188
00:10:09.165 --> 00:10:12.105
to control the direction the horse should go.

189
00:10:13.165 --> 00:10:16.635
And it's tiny though.

190
00:10:16.665 --> 00:10:20.595
It's so small, it's how the rider controls the horse, right?

191
00:10:22.575 --> 00:10:24.545
Similar for our words for us.

192
00:10:25.085 --> 00:10:28.985
As the tongue goes, the body will follow.

193
00:10:32.175 --> 00:10:36.475
He also uses second this picture of a ship with a rudder.

194
00:10:37.705 --> 00:10:40.395
That rudder is the small part on the back of the ship

195
00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:43.635
that's tiny relative to the size of the rest of the ship.

196
00:10:43.975 --> 00:10:45.995
But it is powerful

197
00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:49.675
because that's how the pilot steers the ship.

198
00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:54.955
James says that similar to the tongue, that it is so small

199
00:10:55.295 --> 00:11:00.155
but it has an outsized influence on the rest of the body

200
00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:03.545
and how true that is, right?

201
00:11:04.995 --> 00:11:07.675
I mean, just think about the old saying that we teach kids.

202
00:11:08.715 --> 00:11:11.635
I think you shall note, as soon as I start saying it, sticks

203
00:11:11.935 --> 00:11:15.275
and stones let's go, can break my bones,

204
00:11:16.015 --> 00:11:18.635
but words can never hurt me.

205
00:11:19.965 --> 00:11:23.635
False. Now I get

206
00:11:23.635 --> 00:11:24.995
the sentiment, I get the point, right?

207
00:11:24.995 --> 00:11:26.315
You can kind of choose to listen

208
00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:27.995
or not listen, I get that point.

209
00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:31.155
But our words do so much damage, right?

210
00:11:33.335 --> 00:11:34.425
Whether it's lies

211
00:11:35.765 --> 00:11:40.475
or gossip, slander, harsh words,

212
00:11:40.695 --> 00:11:42.515
simply talking someone down.

213
00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:46.875
That's why Jesus said in Matthew 1236,

214
00:11:47.835 --> 00:11:50.155
a fearsome verse, he said, on the day of judgment,

215
00:11:50.155 --> 00:11:53.725
people will give account for every careless word they speak,

216
00:11:56.285 --> 00:11:58.275
every flippant comment, every

217
00:11:59.005 --> 00:12:02.195
harsh word just tossed on that.

218
00:12:02.615 --> 00:12:04.835
He says they're all being recorded.

219
00:12:08.005 --> 00:12:09.185
And that's not only to teachers.

220
00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:11.585
He's talking about that to all of us.

221
00:12:14.595 --> 00:12:15.615
And why does he say that?

222
00:12:15.675 --> 00:12:18.655
He says that because our words can hurt people.

223
00:12:21.665 --> 00:12:24.085
That's the rest you saw of James three five.

224
00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:28.285
He says, how great a forest is set ablaze

225
00:12:29.265 --> 00:12:30.725
by such a small fire.

226
00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:37.845
Like it doesn't take more than a spark to set acres

227
00:12:38.185 --> 00:12:40.205
of land ablaze.

228
00:12:43.185 --> 00:12:44.645
In high school, my my friend

229
00:12:44.645 --> 00:12:48.965
and I were foolishly setting off fireworks in a wheat field

230
00:12:48.965 --> 00:12:50.805
that had just been plowed after harvest.

231
00:12:53.915 --> 00:12:56.735
And so I happened to have one of those strobe lights

232
00:12:56.805 --> 00:12:58.135
that just flashes really bright.

233
00:12:58.155 --> 00:13:00.935
And I started it and tossed it out in the field

234
00:13:00.935 --> 00:13:01.975
and it starts to flash

235
00:13:02.675 --> 00:13:04.895
and all of a sudden we start to see some flames.

236
00:13:05.435 --> 00:13:06.895
And all of a sudden we saw it starts

237
00:13:06.915 --> 00:13:09.975
to spread pretty quickly and it's two of us.

238
00:13:10.115 --> 00:13:11.935
And this thing is starting to go quick.

239
00:13:13.315 --> 00:13:15.575
And so we moved as fast as ever moved in my life

240
00:13:15.755 --> 00:13:17.255
to go kick dirt and dirt and dirt.

241
00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:18.855
And then you're kicking more stubble on top.

242
00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:21.095
It's starting to flame up. Praise the Lord.

243
00:13:21.105 --> 00:13:22.135
We're able to stop it.

244
00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:24.775
But um, it's a picture of

245
00:13:24.775 --> 00:13:26.855
what happens when we toss one little flame.

246
00:13:28.355 --> 00:13:29.895
The whole thing starts place.

247
00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:35.015
That's Why we have to be so careful with our words.

248
00:13:35.295 --> 00:13:38.975
'cause verse six, he says, the tongue is a fire.

249
00:13:40.065 --> 00:13:41.995
It's a world of unrighteousness.

250
00:13:44.855 --> 00:13:47.545
Like even more than that song, that baby, it's a firework.

251
00:13:47.545 --> 00:13:49.945
Like this is what we're talking about.

252
00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:56.505
Our words can start forest fires.

253
00:13:56.505 --> 00:13:58.865
It reminds me, you remember the old Smokey the bear

254
00:13:59.145 --> 00:14:01.145
campaign, US Forest Service, right?

255
00:14:01.425 --> 00:14:04.225
Remember the picture? What's this slogan?

256
00:14:05.495 --> 00:14:09.025
Only you can prevent forest fires.

257
00:14:12.045 --> 00:14:15.465
Is that not true for us today in life?

258
00:14:17.795 --> 00:14:19.205
It's up to each one of us

259
00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:23.605
to keep from scattering sparks on the dry ground

260
00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:25.605
of people's lives all around us.

261
00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:29.415
'cause that's the reality, right?

262
00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:30.895
Every one of us is struggling.

263
00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:33.975
Every one of us has this, this stubble,

264
00:14:33.975 --> 00:14:35.535
this dry ground in our lives.

265
00:14:35.635 --> 00:14:39.095
And if we start scattering sparks all over everybody,

266
00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:41.015
it's gonna be blazes.

267
00:14:44.095 --> 00:14:47.525
Let's be careful with our words, careful

268
00:14:47.525 --> 00:14:49.045
with our Facebook comments.

269
00:14:52.345 --> 00:14:56.045
Be careful with our Snapchat posts. How they disappear.

270
00:14:56.465 --> 00:15:00.655
No, let's be careful

271
00:15:00.725 --> 00:15:04.965
with our text threads about someone else.

272
00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:08.445
Let's be careful with our emails

273
00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.845
because look again at verses nine

274
00:15:13.845 --> 00:15:15.525
through 12 here in James three,

275
00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:22.225
this is James continuing his argument.

276
00:15:22.225 --> 00:15:23.785
He's still talking about the same thing.

277
00:15:23.805 --> 00:15:27.105
But notice he says it here referring to brothers

278
00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:29.425
when he says brothers,

279
00:15:29.455 --> 00:15:31.665
he's meaning the church fellow Christians.

280
00:15:31.775 --> 00:15:33.105
He's talking to believers.

281
00:15:34.885 --> 00:15:37.065
So look at what he says, nine through 12 with it,

282
00:15:37.065 --> 00:15:39.625
with our tongues, we bless our Lord and Father.

283
00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:42.865
And with it we curse people who are made in the likeness

284
00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:45.945
of God from the same mouth come blessing

285
00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:48.225
and cursing my brothers.

286
00:15:49.395 --> 00:15:51.385
These things ought not to be so.

287
00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:54.825
Meaning the church is participating in this,

288
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:58.625
does a spring pour forth water from the same opening both

289
00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.665
fresh and salt water?

290
00:16:00.325 --> 00:16:04.265
Can a fig tree bear olives or a grapevine? Produce figs? No.

291
00:16:04.265 --> 00:16:07.025
Neither can a salt pond yield freshwater.

292
00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:12.555
Like so. You see what he says here to the church?

293
00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:16.795
He says, somehow we have justified in our minds

294
00:16:17.025 --> 00:16:19.835
that we can praise God in here

295
00:16:20.175 --> 00:16:23.595
and sing these great songs and then walk out there

296
00:16:23.855 --> 00:16:27.635
and gossip and slander and cut down brothers

297
00:16:27.655 --> 00:16:30.755
and sisters cursing them.

298
00:16:34.095 --> 00:16:38.235
How does that work? I mean, James is

299
00:16:38.235 --> 00:16:39.475
as confused as anyone.

300
00:16:40.345 --> 00:16:42.955
He's saying, how can from the same mouth come blessing

301
00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:44.275
and cursing?

302
00:16:44.275 --> 00:16:47.555
He says, these things ought not to be.

303
00:16:47.695 --> 00:16:51.845
So it's wrong and it's not the way it should be.

304
00:16:55.225 --> 00:16:57.835
What he's saying here basically is that a Christian,

305
00:16:58.475 --> 00:17:02.395
a the words a Christian uses should be very different

306
00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:06.695
than the words that everyone else uses.

307
00:17:09.555 --> 00:17:11.315
'cause think about the last illustrations.

308
00:17:11.315 --> 00:17:13.115
He, he James is great at illustrations.

309
00:17:13.135 --> 00:17:15.315
So look at the last couple illustrations he gives.

310
00:17:15.665 --> 00:17:17.715
What what he means by these is that if,

311
00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:22.945
if someone's been made a new creation by the Lord, then

312
00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:26.585
what they say should reflect

313
00:17:26.975 --> 00:17:28.465
that they are a new creation.

314
00:17:31.205 --> 00:17:33.425
So he, he gives the illustration of a spring of water.

315
00:17:36.045 --> 00:17:38.425
Is it possible for that spout

316
00:17:39.565 --> 00:17:44.225
to put out both fresh and salt water at the same time?

317
00:17:46.005 --> 00:17:49.285
No. The source

318
00:17:50.065 --> 00:17:51.965
is only one of those two.

319
00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.705
It's either salt water or it's fresh water.

320
00:17:56.765 --> 00:17:58.425
If there's any mixture, it's salt water

321
00:18:01.775 --> 00:18:05.635
or, or think of a fig tree, which by the way,

322
00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.435
I was growing up in a time when,

323
00:18:07.505 --> 00:18:09.435
when fig newtons were kind of popular.

324
00:18:11.755 --> 00:18:13.235
I, I, I knew they existed

325
00:18:13.455 --> 00:18:14.995
and all I knew is they were terrible cookies.

326
00:18:18.935 --> 00:18:20.675
But it wasn't, listen, it wasn't

327
00:18:20.675 --> 00:18:23.555
until like a couple years ago that I finally put it together

328
00:18:23.555 --> 00:18:24.955
that those are made with fix.

329
00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:28.395
Like legitimately, I was clueless.

330
00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:33.075
Just thought that was the name figs and oh wow, okay,

331
00:18:34.975 --> 00:18:36.235
but when you get a fig tree,

332
00:18:37.425 --> 00:18:39.835
will you get olives off of a fig tree?

333
00:18:40.935 --> 00:18:42.635
No. It's logic.

334
00:18:42.815 --> 00:18:45.315
We understand this similarly, like you have a grapevine

335
00:18:45.575 --> 00:18:48.635
and you're walking down the, the vineyard rows

336
00:18:48.635 --> 00:18:51.115
and you're, you're picking figs off the

337
00:18:51.115 --> 00:18:52.635
grapevine and snacking, right?

338
00:18:52.775 --> 00:18:57.715
No, you get grapes off a grapevine just like you see it back

339
00:18:57.715 --> 00:18:59.435
in Genesis five all the way from the beginning.

340
00:18:59.655 --> 00:19:02.875
It talks about when we bear children as humans, we

341
00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:07.875
reproduce according to our likeness, According to

342
00:19:07.895 --> 00:19:09.675
who we are, our nature.

343
00:19:10.175 --> 00:19:12.115
You cannot bring forth something

344
00:19:12.115 --> 00:19:14.275
that is not corresponding to your nature.

345
00:19:16.325 --> 00:19:21.295
Fig tree, figs, olive tree, olives, that's the point here.

346
00:19:22.855 --> 00:19:27.095
A truly transformed heart will produce the things

347
00:19:27.765 --> 00:19:30.055
that God wants to produce

348
00:19:31.115 --> 00:19:34.455
rather than producing the things set on fire By hell.

349
00:19:34.545 --> 00:19:37.935
James says, the ways of the world around us.

350
00:19:41.375 --> 00:19:43.795
Now, we're not gonna do that perfectly yet.

351
00:19:44.015 --> 00:19:48.075
We understand that that's still coming.

352
00:19:48.295 --> 00:19:50.755
On the day that Jesus returns Philippians one, six,

353
00:19:50.845 --> 00:19:53.155
he'll complete the work that he began in you.

354
00:19:53.415 --> 00:19:55.915
That's still one day for us

355
00:19:56.015 --> 00:19:58.755
to perfectly produce the things God wants.

356
00:19:58.775 --> 00:20:01.075
But our goal now should be

357
00:20:01.135 --> 00:20:04.195
to tame our tongues just talking about this one thing,

358
00:20:04.705 --> 00:20:06.275
tame our tongues more

359
00:20:06.275 --> 00:20:09.435
and more in the power of the Spirit of God

360
00:20:11.665 --> 00:20:16.005
so that our lives reflect that image

361
00:20:16.105 --> 00:20:20.805
of God more like Ephesians four says, we should

362
00:20:24.695 --> 00:20:27.945
therefore having put away falsehood, let each one

363
00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:30.465
of you speak the truth with his neighbor.

364
00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:33.865
For we are members one of another.

365
00:20:36.815 --> 00:20:39.315
Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths,

366
00:20:40.175 --> 00:20:43.035
but only such as is good for building up

367
00:20:43.615 --> 00:20:44.875
as fits the occasion

368
00:20:44.905 --> 00:20:47.245
that it may give grace to those who hear.

369
00:20:49.395 --> 00:20:52.215
Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God

370
00:20:52.395 --> 00:20:54.335
by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

371
00:20:54.335 --> 00:20:58.015
He's saying, our words can grieve the spirit of God.

372
00:21:00.235 --> 00:21:03.535
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor

373
00:21:03.535 --> 00:21:08.295
and slander be put away from you along with all malice.

374
00:21:08.515 --> 00:21:12.095
Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another

375
00:21:12.275 --> 00:21:14.375
as God in Christ forgave you.

376
00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:19.295
That's the image of God

377
00:21:20.325 --> 00:21:21.655
reflected in our words.

378
00:21:26.905 --> 00:21:28.485
But why is this such a big deal?

379
00:21:31.605 --> 00:21:34.145
Why does James like, why does he make such a big deal?

380
00:21:34.165 --> 00:21:37.505
Why should we be so concerned about this?

381
00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:44.455
James three, nine, look at it again.

382
00:21:44.455 --> 00:21:47.495
This is really his whole reason for writing this.

383
00:21:48.585 --> 00:21:52.455
James says, he wants our words to match our theology,

384
00:21:52.595 --> 00:21:53.735
to match what we believe.

385
00:21:55.285 --> 00:21:56.335
Look again, verse nine,

386
00:22:00.095 --> 00:22:03.185
with our tongues, we bless our Lord and Father.

387
00:22:03.605 --> 00:22:06.025
And with it we curse people

388
00:22:06.165 --> 00:22:09.065
who are made in the likeness of God.

389
00:22:12.425 --> 00:22:15.045
See, this is where we're gonna jump onto this big rock

390
00:22:15.145 --> 00:22:18.725
of humanity because his reason

391
00:22:20.755 --> 00:22:23.895
for not speaking the way that we often speak is

392
00:22:23.895 --> 00:22:27.215
because people are made in the image of God.

393
00:22:31.445 --> 00:22:33.825
And so the fundamental question we need to start with here

394
00:22:33.825 --> 00:22:37.025
as we talk about humanity is this question, who are we?

395
00:22:38.295 --> 00:22:41.825
It's the question everybody's asking, who am I?

396
00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:46.025
Well, thankfully God's word gives us that answer.

397
00:22:48.135 --> 00:22:49.475
And verse nine gave us a clue

398
00:22:49.475 --> 00:22:52.715
that we are made in the likeness or the image of God.

399
00:22:52.715 --> 00:22:55.435
And that idea comes all the way from the beginning,

400
00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:58.115
from the first page of your Bible.

401
00:22:58.115 --> 00:23:01.395
Genesis one, where God created everything.

402
00:23:01.395 --> 00:23:03.995
Genesis 1 26 and 27 says this.

403
00:23:03.995 --> 00:23:07.435
Then God said, let us make man or mankind

404
00:23:07.455 --> 00:23:11.275
or humanity in our image after our likeness.

405
00:23:11.735 --> 00:23:14.035
Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds

406
00:23:14.035 --> 00:23:16.235
of the heavens, the livestock over all the earth,

407
00:23:16.305 --> 00:23:18.875
over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.

408
00:23:19.415 --> 00:23:22.795
So God created man in his own image, in the image

409
00:23:22.795 --> 00:23:27.315
of God in created him, male and female, he created them.

410
00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:34.715
But what does it mean to be created in the image of God?

411
00:23:36.425 --> 00:23:39.435
Because that, that thread runs through the whole scriptures.

412
00:23:39.455 --> 00:23:42.115
It starts in Genesis one. It goes all throughout.

413
00:23:42.115 --> 00:23:43.715
You can find it here and here and here

414
00:23:43.715 --> 00:23:47.045
and here even into James three, even beyond James three.

415
00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:49.725
What does it mean? The image of God?

416
00:23:49.725 --> 00:23:51.125
Well, okay, just let's think about

417
00:23:51.155 --> 00:23:52.285
when you look in a mirror.

418
00:23:54.285 --> 00:23:55.455
Some of you didn't this morning,

419
00:23:55.455 --> 00:23:56.735
but I'm not gonna say like, okay,

420
00:23:58.645 --> 00:24:00.815
When you look in the image, you look in the mirror.

421
00:24:00.815 --> 00:24:04.775
What do you see? You see the reflection of your image.

422
00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:08.335
That's a similar idea.

423
00:24:08.335 --> 00:24:11.375
It's not exact to this, but in a similar way.

424
00:24:11.755 --> 00:24:14.655
To be in the image of God is we are to reflect God

425
00:24:15.555 --> 00:24:18.535
as he made us like him in many ways.

426
00:24:21.195 --> 00:24:25.375
His character, his personality, his nature, his heart,

427
00:24:25.635 --> 00:24:27.495
his actions like who he is,

428
00:24:28.865 --> 00:24:30.655
which means you can learn a little bit about

429
00:24:30.755 --> 00:24:32.015
God by looking at humans.

430
00:24:33.195 --> 00:24:35.495
Not everything but a little bit.

431
00:24:36.115 --> 00:24:38.095
If we're made in his image,

432
00:24:41.195 --> 00:24:43.715
a further step is that Colossians one 15 says,

433
00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:47.395
Jesus is the image of the invisible God.

434
00:24:50.085 --> 00:24:53.225
And he's perfectly the image of the invisible God.

435
00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:54.985
Meaning when you looked into the face of Jesus,

436
00:24:55.205 --> 00:24:57.105
you saw God, right?

437
00:24:57.365 --> 00:25:01.265
Saw that last week. He is God.

438
00:25:01.325 --> 00:25:05.585
And so he's the image, the visible representation to us,

439
00:25:07.345 --> 00:25:11.025
the way we know him to a lesser extent.

440
00:25:11.025 --> 00:25:14.265
That's how God designed humans to be as well.

441
00:25:14.415 --> 00:25:18.865
Because in the story of creation, no other creation piece

442
00:25:19.445 --> 00:25:21.425
was created in the image of God.

443
00:25:21.535 --> 00:25:25.815
Only humans. Just,

444
00:25:25.815 --> 00:25:27.095
just stop for a second with that.

445
00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:31.215
Think of the value of humanity

446
00:25:31.725 --> 00:25:34.125
Then Everyone,

447
00:25:35.345 --> 00:25:38.435
because there's not a person who's ever lived

448
00:25:38.435 --> 00:25:41.075
that was not made in the image

449
00:25:41.295 --> 00:25:44.215
of God valuable.

450
00:25:45.465 --> 00:25:50.405
Every one of us. That's why

451
00:25:50.405 --> 00:25:53.845
our church's value of compelling love says

452
00:25:53.845 --> 00:25:55.725
that we demonstrate the love of Jesus

453
00:25:55.985 --> 00:25:58.405
by respecting the dignity of every person,

454
00:26:02.285 --> 00:26:04.325
sacrificing for our neighbors, cultivating unity

455
00:26:04.325 --> 00:26:06.965
with our faith family again.

456
00:26:07.025 --> 00:26:09.205
Why? Because every person's made in the image

457
00:26:09.205 --> 00:26:10.485
of God just like I am.

458
00:26:12.585 --> 00:26:16.165
So there's dignity, there's value that I need to show

459
00:26:16.225 --> 00:26:17.605
and love them like that.

460
00:26:18.195 --> 00:26:20.765
Each man walking around on the face

461
00:26:20.765 --> 00:26:22.245
of the earth is an independ,

462
00:26:22.765 --> 00:26:24.445
independently valuable creation.

463
00:26:25.875 --> 00:26:27.005
Each woman walking

464
00:26:27.005 --> 00:26:30.885
around on this earth is an independently valuable creation.

465
00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:35.815
And listen, I I'm gonna add a caveat to that one,

466
00:26:35.815 --> 00:26:37.855
because it's not just

467
00:26:37.855 --> 00:26:39.695
because she's with a man that she's valuable.

468
00:26:42.415 --> 00:26:45.205
In fact, it's often in spite of the man she's with,

469
00:26:45.895 --> 00:26:47.445
She's That she's valuable.

470
00:26:51.405 --> 00:26:52.415
Need to be reminded of that.

471
00:26:52.415 --> 00:26:57.195
Sometimes I think independently valuable

472
00:26:57.515 --> 00:26:59.395
creations, every single person who's walking around the face

473
00:26:59.395 --> 00:27:00.555
of the earth, who ever has every will,

474
00:27:01.355 --> 00:27:03.115
independently valuable creations

475
00:27:03.115 --> 00:27:05.515
because of the image of God.

476
00:27:05.705 --> 00:27:08.435
That means when we start treating people like they are

477
00:27:08.795 --> 00:27:10.915
property or like they are transactions

478
00:27:11.335 --> 00:27:14.955
or like they are animals or like they are not even people.

479
00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:19.275
We deny God's image in that person.

480
00:27:25.585 --> 00:27:30.045
But the follow up to who we are is the question then

481
00:27:30.825 --> 00:27:34.855
why are we first?

482
00:27:34.995 --> 00:27:39.015
Who are we? But then why are, why do we exist?

483
00:27:39.555 --> 00:27:43.515
Why are we even here? Well,

484
00:27:43.515 --> 00:27:44.675
you go back to Genesis one.

485
00:27:44.735 --> 00:27:46.275
God gave our first parents, Adam

486
00:27:46.275 --> 00:27:47.555
and Eve, he gave them a task.

487
00:27:48.055 --> 00:27:49.875
He said, be fruitful and multiply.

488
00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:52.755
Have dominion over the earth. Fill it, subdue it.

489
00:27:53.995 --> 00:27:55.975
That's still one of our tasks today.

490
00:27:56.075 --> 00:27:59.655
In the image of God, in our parents' task, along

491
00:27:59.655 --> 00:28:01.615
with relating to God, relating to others is kind

492
00:28:01.615 --> 00:28:03.775
of threefold, relate to nature,

493
00:28:03.935 --> 00:28:05.255
relate to God, relate to others.

494
00:28:06.595 --> 00:28:09.815
But here's how God says it. Isaiah 43 7.

495
00:28:11.715 --> 00:28:15.535
He says, everyone who's called by my name, whom I created

496
00:28:15.875 --> 00:28:19.735
for my glory, Whom I formed and made.

497
00:28:21.835 --> 00:28:23.415
See that's the way believers have said

498
00:28:23.415 --> 00:28:24.495
it for thousands of years.

499
00:28:25.635 --> 00:28:28.375
Why we are here is to glorify God.

500
00:28:30.185 --> 00:28:32.405
That's why first and foremost, that's it.

501
00:28:32.585 --> 00:28:37.405
We were created for his glory, not for our own glory.

502
00:28:38.465 --> 00:28:41.645
Not to make ourselves famous or even comfortable.

503
00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:46.885
Our job, our first task, what we are created to do is

504
00:28:46.885 --> 00:28:49.085
to lift high the name of the Lord

505
00:28:49.425 --> 00:28:52.285
and to make much of him with our lives.

506
00:28:54.385 --> 00:28:59.245
Every one of us. That's also why

507
00:28:59.245 --> 00:29:02.565
Second Corinthians five calls us as believers,

508
00:29:02.945 --> 00:29:04.125
his ambassadors.

509
00:29:06.515 --> 00:29:08.035
'cause think about what an ambassador does.

510
00:29:09.545 --> 00:29:13.635
They are official representatives of one nation to

511
00:29:14.195 --> 00:29:15.515
a foreign nation.

512
00:29:16.385 --> 00:29:17.755
They are to uphold the values

513
00:29:18.255 --> 00:29:22.235
and beliefs of their home nation, representing it even

514
00:29:22.375 --> 00:29:25.435
as they work to engage the foreign nation

515
00:29:26.025 --> 00:29:28.035
that is home for them.

516
00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:29.635
Same for us today.

517
00:29:33.545 --> 00:29:35.835
Christian, listen, this means

518
00:29:36.705 --> 00:29:38.995
this world is not our home.

519
00:29:42.995 --> 00:29:47.005
This is not all there is. God is building our eternal home.

520
00:29:47.065 --> 00:29:50.245
And that's an eternal home with him face to face.

521
00:29:53.345 --> 00:29:55.605
So let's, let's be careful

522
00:29:57.355 --> 00:30:01.025
that we are not acting as if this is all there is

523
00:30:03.335 --> 00:30:06.075
and living in light of nothing to come.

524
00:30:06.075 --> 00:30:09.835
That we better maintain this as the highest good.

525
00:30:10.535 --> 00:30:11.795
No, there's there's better coming.

526
00:30:13.315 --> 00:30:15.575
That's true home as well.

527
00:30:16.195 --> 00:30:18.375
But here's the beauty of this doctrine of humanity.

528
00:30:21.585 --> 00:30:24.525
It teaches us that this world actually does matter.

529
00:30:26.555 --> 00:30:29.485
That our bodies actually matter.

530
00:30:31.105 --> 00:30:32.785
'cause God didn't create us as ghosts

531
00:30:32.845 --> 00:30:36.465
or as some kind of being that's just sort of floating.

532
00:30:36.605 --> 00:30:38.265
He created us with bodies.

533
00:30:39.005 --> 00:30:41.905
Yes, they're temporary, but they're not throwaway.

534
00:30:44.735 --> 00:30:47.225
This world is temporary, but it's not throwaway.

535
00:30:47.285 --> 00:30:49.985
We are to treat it and to treat our bodies

536
00:30:50.085 --> 00:30:53.625
and to treat others with the dignity of the image

537
00:30:53.645 --> 00:30:55.585
of God in them, just like in us.

538
00:31:00.915 --> 00:31:02.335
But here's where the problem comes.

539
00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:06.375
We look around in this world

540
00:31:06.395 --> 00:31:08.215
and we see broken relationships.

541
00:31:09.325 --> 00:31:11.735
Instead of the perfect one that Adam and Eve had

542
00:31:11.735 --> 00:31:13.415
before the fall of sin.

543
00:31:15.485 --> 00:31:16.505
We see broken knees.

544
00:31:17.645 --> 00:31:20.865
We see cancer, we see death.

545
00:31:24.815 --> 00:31:26.715
And so we think, all right, this is why we're here.

546
00:31:26.715 --> 00:31:29.115
This is who we are. What went wrong then?

547
00:31:31.285 --> 00:31:35.715
'cause this is a mess. We need to call it out.

548
00:31:35.715 --> 00:31:37.155
This is a mess. What went wrong?

549
00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:39.555
Why are things not perfect the way they once were?

550
00:31:42.705 --> 00:31:45.155
Well, we're gonna hit this a lot more next week when we talk

551
00:31:45.155 --> 00:31:47.155
about salvation as one of our big rocks.

552
00:31:47.175 --> 00:31:49.795
But the problem comes just three chapters into the Bible.

553
00:31:50.185 --> 00:31:54.805
When sin entered the world, We want to answer

554
00:31:54.825 --> 00:31:56.205
to why everything is a mess.

555
00:31:56.235 --> 00:31:57.925
Because of chapter three of Genesis.

556
00:31:58.675 --> 00:32:00.965
When Adam and Eve chose to disobey God,

557
00:32:00.965 --> 00:32:02.325
they chose to eat the fruit.

558
00:32:02.535 --> 00:32:04.725
Everything fractured at that moment.

559
00:32:06.745 --> 00:32:08.765
The openness and honesty they once had

560
00:32:08.765 --> 00:32:12.765
with God was now hiding from God and blaming other people.

561
00:32:15.455 --> 00:32:17.115
The freedom that they once had together

562
00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:20.995
with each other was now filled with shame and covering.

563
00:32:25.185 --> 00:32:28.115
It's what we refer to as the fall of humanity, the fall

564
00:32:28.135 --> 00:32:32.035
of mankind where every one of us who has the seed

565
00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:34.835
of Adam is now counted guilty as well

566
00:32:34.835 --> 00:32:36.515
because of what he did.

567
00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:40.365
It's Not fair. It's just part of the way it is

568
00:32:42.175 --> 00:32:44.465
because he's our head in that way.

569
00:32:44.725 --> 00:32:45.825
We also have a head in Christ.

570
00:32:45.825 --> 00:32:47.745
We'll get to that in a second. That counts for us.

571
00:32:47.805 --> 00:32:49.785
So we better believe that he can count for us,

572
00:32:52.355 --> 00:32:54.135
but we are affected in our bodies.

573
00:32:54.195 --> 00:32:57.215
We get sick, we get injured, we die the world.

574
00:32:57.285 --> 00:32:59.655
It's hard because of

575
00:32:59.655 --> 00:33:02.795
that, we're affected in our bodies.

576
00:33:02.805 --> 00:33:04.435
We're also affected in our souls

577
00:33:04.685 --> 00:33:08.995
where we have a sinful disposition from conception.

578
00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:12.605
Just look at these kids running around, right?

579
00:33:12.605 --> 00:33:13.885
They're not little perfect angels.

580
00:33:14.945 --> 00:33:16.685
You have to teach 'em how to sin.

581
00:33:19.515 --> 00:33:21.645
It's because of this. We're totally depraved.

582
00:33:21.645 --> 00:33:24.645
We're unable to do good before God.

583
00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:31.615
And that poisoned salt pond that's in there

584
00:33:33.545 --> 00:33:35.645
is why we spew venom on each other.

585
00:33:38.915 --> 00:33:41.125
It's all because of the fall of humanity.

586
00:33:42.165 --> 00:33:46.095
Because sin, it makes us guilty by our sin as well.

587
00:33:46.115 --> 00:33:47.975
But it's because sin broke everything.

588
00:33:52.455 --> 00:33:54.065
Okay, so what's the solution then?

589
00:33:57.525 --> 00:33:58.545
What's the solution?

590
00:34:01.335 --> 00:34:03.385
It's that we need a heart transplant it.

591
00:34:05.555 --> 00:34:07.375
We need new hearts. We need new spirits.

592
00:34:07.375 --> 00:34:09.055
We need to be made new creations.

593
00:34:09.835 --> 00:34:11.335
That's the answer to this problem.

594
00:34:12.785 --> 00:34:15.405
It says, God says it in Ezekiel 36.

595
00:34:19.275 --> 00:34:20.615
Listen To how he says this.

596
00:34:23.055 --> 00:34:25.135
I will give you, this is him predicting what's

597
00:34:25.135 --> 00:34:26.295
coming a couple hundred years later.

598
00:34:26.295 --> 00:34:27.615
He says, I'll give you a new heart,

599
00:34:28.015 --> 00:34:29.695
a new spirit I will put within you.

600
00:34:30.005 --> 00:34:32.695
I'll remove the heart of stone from your flesh,

601
00:34:32.765 --> 00:34:34.135
give you a heart of flesh.

602
00:34:34.525 --> 00:34:36.135
I'll put my spirit within you

603
00:34:36.355 --> 00:34:38.495
and cause you to walk in my statutes

604
00:34:38.495 --> 00:34:41.295
and be careful to obey my rules.

605
00:34:42.675 --> 00:34:47.575
See the only answer, the solution to our problem.

606
00:34:48.375 --> 00:34:50.455
Specifically, let's talk today about our words.

607
00:34:52.345 --> 00:34:55.485
The only solution is not trying harder.

608
00:34:57.685 --> 00:35:00.615
It's not putting a quarter in the jar every time you curse.

609
00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:05.855
It's not building up accountability around you.

610
00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.095
The true solution is that we need new hearts.

611
00:35:11.825 --> 00:35:14.325
We need the springs of our hearts

612
00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:17.805
to be producing fresh water, not salt water anymore.

613
00:35:19.345 --> 00:35:22.725
We need the trees of our hearts to be producing good fruit,

614
00:35:23.025 --> 00:35:24.325
not the wrong kind of fruit.

615
00:35:27.075 --> 00:35:29.175
Listen, if if our tongue, James said it,

616
00:35:29.175 --> 00:35:31.815
if our tongues are set on fire by hell,

617
00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:37.405
then we need the living water of the gospel to come

618
00:35:37.425 --> 00:35:39.245
and quench that fire, don't we?

619
00:35:41.465 --> 00:35:44.685
To put that fire out the the living water of Jesus

620
00:35:44.865 --> 00:35:46.205
to spring up from within us

621
00:35:46.265 --> 00:35:47.725
and quench the fire

622
00:35:47.955 --> 00:35:51.525
that is just present within us from birth.

623
00:35:53.155 --> 00:35:56.535
That's What we need. And that starts

624
00:35:56.635 --> 00:35:57.935
by confessing your sin.

625
00:35:57.955 --> 00:36:02.495
You confess your problem with words to the Lord, asking

626
00:36:02.555 --> 00:36:04.575
for his forgiveness, giving your life to him

627
00:36:04.575 --> 00:36:05.615
because of his great love

628
00:36:05.615 --> 00:36:07.415
and grace for you in spite of yourself

629
00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:09.535
that then second Corinthians five 17,

630
00:36:09.715 --> 00:36:12.455
if anyone is in Christ, if's a new creation.

631
00:36:13.965 --> 00:36:17.135
When you confess and repent and believe He receive

632
00:36:17.315 --> 00:36:21.015
and receive his forgiveness, he makes you this new creation.

633
00:36:21.565 --> 00:36:23.335
Then though, here's the trouble.

634
00:36:26.245 --> 00:36:27.575
Once that is true of us,

635
00:36:30.325 --> 00:36:34.775
then we must soak in his living water to quench any fire

636
00:36:34.775 --> 00:36:36.695
that still remains in us.

637
00:36:39.325 --> 00:36:42.955
We've gotta abide in Jesus, in His word, in His spirit,

638
00:36:45.005 --> 00:36:47.035
gotta fill that sponge of our hearts with,

639
00:36:47.065 --> 00:36:49.595
with his living water, not with the water

640
00:36:49.595 --> 00:36:50.715
of the world or the flesh.

641
00:36:52.285 --> 00:36:56.015
Because if we don't soak in him, abide in him.

642
00:36:56.235 --> 00:36:58.415
If we allow our sinful flesh to dominate,

643
00:36:58.845 --> 00:37:03.215
Galatians five says, the things we get are strife, jealousy,

644
00:37:04.975 --> 00:37:06.465
fits of anger division.

645
00:37:10.625 --> 00:37:13.685
But if we instead allow the spirit of God to dominate,

646
00:37:15.505 --> 00:37:19.125
it says we get things like love, joy,

647
00:37:20.755 --> 00:37:25.625
peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

648
00:37:26.395 --> 00:37:29.145
gentleness, self-control.

649
00:37:31.005 --> 00:37:33.825
And if that is the new heart, God's building in you,

650
00:37:34.175 --> 00:37:36.665
that comes out of our words first

651
00:37:36.725 --> 00:37:40.385
and foremost, remember, out of the heart, the mouth speaks.
