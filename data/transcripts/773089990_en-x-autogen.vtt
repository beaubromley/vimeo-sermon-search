00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.600
Good evening.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.500
I'll give you one more try this gonna be a kind of

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.900
a give and take evening. Good evening.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.200
I thought you might be awake. This is going

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.400
to be a great great night. And I'm glad that you're here. I

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.300
want to really quickly go over what we've talked about. You've heard

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.900
this so often I'm hoping you can do it yourself, but this

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.100
is the discipleship pathway everything. We

9
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.600
do here points people towards becoming

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.400
disciple makers and my prayer and

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.200
the prayer of all of our leadership is that we would not

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.400
just be people who have discipleship classes, but we

13
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.400
would actually be disciple makers and it would happen to

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.100
be it would happen

15
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.500
to multiply in a manner and that's what most of this

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.600
evening tonight is about is multiplying yourself multiplying

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.800
a manner that we could plant churches literally

18
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.300
all over some of

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.900
you don't know this but our state is

20
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.100
ask us the we

21
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.500
cooperate with the Baptist Churches all

22
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.800
over the state of Oklahoma, and they're currently six empty church

23
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.300
buildings that need planted.

24
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.700
Planted and right now,

25
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.800
we're just needing disciple makers to multiply

26
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.700
disciple makers so we can send disciple makers

27
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.500
to replant these churches. And so this is

28
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.300
the engine that it not just worshiped on

29
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
Sunday. See if I know how to do this. This is

30
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.900
what is it's every

31
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.500
Every week it's a mystery. So not just worship together.

32
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.600
Not just our big events. But Community groups. It's

33
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
kind of our Bell cow, which means that most of you are in

34
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.500
one but through those social relationships.

35
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.300
We try to develop Intimate Relationships.

36
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.200
So this right here is a

37
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
key where we have intimate relationships and we

38
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.100
can get to the the level of transparency and

39
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.300
intimacy and accountability in discipleship.

40
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.300
And what is a disciple

41
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.500
one who's following Jesus one who is being changed or

42
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.200
transformed by Jesus and one who's committed to the

43
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.400
mission of Jesus and that's disciple making you'll gonna

44
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.100
need to memorize that now what I

45
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.200
just said was is the large group you have to

46
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.300
remain silent.

47
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.200
Right, if you don't I mean

48
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.100
you have to stand up and sing when you're supposed to but then during the sermon you're supposed

49
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.500
to remain silent. So there's not a lot of conversation going on and if

50
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.700
there is you get in trouble your mom or perhaps a

51
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000
deacon will thump you on the back of the head, but but

52
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.200
that's not the way it is. What we're trying to do is get to

53
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.000
this point over here where we have like we said transparency even

54
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.700
vulnerability intimacy and ultimately

55
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.200
accountability. All right, you see

56
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.400
I didn't even try the way you guys have made fun of me.

57
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.400
All right. So now this is the important part.

58
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.600
Okay, and I need everybody to pay attention. All

59
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.400
right. What is God done in your

60
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.700
micro group the last 12 weeks?

61
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.500
If you'll remember if you'll go back with me

62
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.400
12 weeks the very first night two,

63
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.400
very interesting thingies happened. And one is

64
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.300
I said, what we're

65
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.300
going to do in a minute is going to be really really awkward and I apologize

66
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.100
in advance.

67
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.200
We're going to we're going to get together in groups

68
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.900
of four and I said try not to do more than four and

69
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.500
you know, some of you busted the Only Rule

70
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.400
the very first night, but so we're

71
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.400
gonna try to get in groups of four and we're going to have a micro group

72
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.800
experiment and this is what I said.

73
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.400
That you're going to be surprised that in 12 weeks

74
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.900
how quickly we begin to bond together

75
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.400
as the supplementers and you're

76
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.400
going to get the sense the closeness and

77
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.200
the intimacy that comes through being able to be honest and

78
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.200
open and transparent with one another and so here

79
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.500
we are 12 weeks later and some of your groups are planting

80
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.400
on continuing and that really wasn't the plan

81
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.400
but if you know it what I've learned about baptist is just

82
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.900
tell them what to do. They're not going to do that thing. All right, but I'm

83
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.100
excited because now we have Micro groups. What I'm

84
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.200
gonna ask you to do is you see here hhbc.com forward

85
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.100
slash disciple I need

86
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.400
for you to go on there and I need for you to click the box that says

87
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.500
update or micro group update and just

88
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.100
register your micro group. We would love to be able to have some simple

89
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.700
Matrix saying that we're growing that

90
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.600
every year we have more disciples than the year before but

91
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.000
you'll have to communicate with me. All right, there's two

92
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.400
other boxes and one is I want to be discipled.

93
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.700
And the other one is I want to make disciples. And

94
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.600
so this is going to be our page where

95
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.100
we are putting groups together. Hopefully, you don't have

96
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.300
to go to that page that you've already been thinking and praying through about who

97
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.600
you're going to ask to be in your micro group. And if

98
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.400
so, then you'll just make an update and say this is our micro group

99
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.900
and this is when we meet where we meet and anyway, so

100
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.100
I ask that you do that as of last night.

101
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.600
We had two.

102
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.000
All right. Thank you. Oh, I see what we could do.

103
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.100
Let's see if we can crash the internet go ahead and pull your phone out Aha

104
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.400
and

105
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.200
that and listen to me if you're gonna come in church and fake signing up

106
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.600
for discipleship shame on you, right? But if

107
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.800
you want to during these testimonies, I

108
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.200
want you to go ahead and and register your

109
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.200
group or register whether you want to be in a disciple group or you

110
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.300
want to make disciples or register the group that you've already put together.

111
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.000
Well you do that.

112
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.600
All right. Now, let's talk about the next few minutes.

113
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.500
Hopefully more than a few.

114
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.300
I'm going to ask for testimonies the Bible says let

115
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.100
the redeemed of the Lord say so.

116
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.500
And so our our witness needs to be more than just showing

117
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500
up showing up is very good, but it

118
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.600
needs to be more than that. It needs for you you need to be able to articulate what

119
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.200
God is doing in your life through

120
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.700
through this discipleship experiment.

121
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.200
And so I'm going

122
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.900
to ask that you not go longer than five minutes. I'm we

123
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.300
don't have a shepherd's crook. We're not going to pull you off,

124
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.400
but everyone in the room will know.

125
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.700
He's going too long or she won't be quiet. You

126
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.100
know is Phil gonna get up and say something, you know,

127
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.300
you don't want the room thinking that about

128
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.400
you. Okay. So three to five minutes what I'd

129
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.400
like you to do is share. What's what's

130
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.400
the Lord been doing? What's he been teaching you how has your

131
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.400
group grown together? And the purpose of this is just

132
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.000
to let you know that this even though it was an experiment. I

133
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.300
I have been convinced from very day

134
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.400
one that that you guys would really fall in

135
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.000
love with one another and just 12 short weeks what would happen if

136
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.600
you really started a micro group and really

137
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.100
begin to do this in Earnest for the right reasons and

138
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.200
not have to listen to me do this thing about

139
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.400
the you know that you really were studying the word of

140
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.400
God together. And then you were talking to one another

141
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.200
and asking important questions like we've been

142
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.700
talking about what would happen if after year what

143
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.200
would happen to your group and how would how would you grow in Christ?

144
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.800
And and so that's what we're trying to do now.

145
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.600
last thing and this is

146
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.200
This is a deal breaker for some of you but but I'm just going

147
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.200
to say I believe in you say I'm a courageous and I

148
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.300
am brave. I didn't think. So. Anyway, thank you.

149
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.700
Thank you, so.

150
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.500
We're going to videotape these testimonies and the reason why

151
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.500
is that we really believe that

152
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.200
and by the way, I don't have any transcripts. I

153
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.000
haven't passed out any scripts for people to read this is

154
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.900
going to be from your heart about what God has done in your group and we're

155
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.300
going to have an opportunity to capture just little

156
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.400
brief 30 second spots and share them on our

157
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.100
churches social media page because we believe in

158
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.200
this Township and discipleship is what we do and and there's

159
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.500
nothing more important than hearing from the

160
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.300
lips of a person whom God has made a difference.

161
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.200
And so I want to show you something real quick. I hope I have

162
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.800
this. Yes.

163
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.800
You can't see anybody, you know right there.

164
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.200
Can I can I just say real quickly? That's about the best

165
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.700
looking young man either ever see? Okay. So

166
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.000
the reason that I pulled this out of the archives.

167
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.100
is that

168
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.600
I've been telling you a story about when I was in 8th

169
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.900
grade how this guy comes to me and says, I want

170
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.600
you to pray about something and started my

171
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.700
very first discipleship experiment experience and

172
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.200
and come to find

173
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.100
out when I moved to Edmond I find out and I've

174
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.000
known that he also lives in Yukon.

175
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.500
And so he and I have been visiting back and forth

176
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.700
since we've moved back here and I asked him to be here tonight. And

177
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.700
so I want you to meet my minister of Youth Joe McKinney

178
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.400
Joe. Could you just stand up real quick? Yeah, let's welcome Joe

179
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.600
McKinney the beautiful wife, Diana.

180
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.400
Now in a minute when the Holy Spirit

181
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.000
begins to move and people are sharing testimonies. I wouldn't be

182
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.100
surprised if a Joe came and shared

183
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.400
and B. He went longer than five minutes.

184
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.000
But anyway, that's the challenge tonight. So, all

185
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.000
right. So what I like for you to

186
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.300
do is and I'm going to show you. Okay a

187
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.400
good disciple maker always models.

188
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.100
What he's asking the disciples in the

189
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.500
group to do so, I'm going to model for you and while I'm

190
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.300
sharing if you would like to share I'm going to have that you

191
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.300
come and sit on the front row. All right, I'm gonna ask that you

192
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.500
come and do it from the platform so that we can get a good lighting situation

193
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.200
for the video. If you don't want to be in video, just

194
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.200
let me know we won't post you on on the social

195
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.800
media page. Okay. So here we go.

196
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.300
And by the way, I'm supposed to do it in less than five

197
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.400
minutes. So you're gonna have to hustle to get down here and sit on the front row. All right,

198
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.000
I need Mark say go.

199
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.100
I haven't been in a micro group, so it didn't

200
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.100
really mean that much to me. I'm just kidding.

201
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.400
No, you guys have heard my stories of

202
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.600
all the things that God has allowed

203
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.600
me to do in Ministry funerals weddings.

204
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.200
Preaching teaching big events

205
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.100
biggest crowd. I think

206
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.300
I've ever spoken to is about 5,000 people.

207
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.200
of all of those things the thing that made the most

208
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.300
difference in my life and the thing that I fell in love with more than anything else

209
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.400
Is being a disciple maker?

210
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.600
And I want that experience for you.

211
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.100
And there's nobody on the front row.

212
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.500
Okay, Helen. Come on up.

213
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.200
Okay stand right here by this and hold that

214
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.800
microphone.

215
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.800
Introduce yourself and tell your story.

216
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.300
Hi, my name is Alisa Campbell and I have been

217
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.000
attending Henderson Hills for almost 20 years.

218
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.500
And Henderson Hills does so

219
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.400
many things great and I can say there's

220
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.800
a long list of things that have touched my heart but this disciple

221
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.400
should making has really touched my heart in

222
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.200
a different way. I guess all my life. I've grown up in

223
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.100
church and I knew about discipleship, but I had never been trained on

224
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.200
how to make a disciple. So this is

225
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.400
what it's meant to me in this group has been so special because of

226
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.200
the openness. Thank you, Carol for leading us letting us

227
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.800
be transparent and just the sharing so I'm

228
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.200
very excited about what comes next and I know

229
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.500
that it kind of prompted me to say in January.

230
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.600
I'm going to be stepping out and trying to make disciples in

231
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.800
a different way. So thank you Phil for what you're doing.

232
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.400
Hi, everyone.

233
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.200
My name is Helen. I've been coming to this

234
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.700
church for about three months four

235
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.500
months five months.

236
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.600
Five months. He's the reason I'm here. I followed him. I

237
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.400
live in Norman. I blame the

238
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.200
holy spirit, so

239
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.600
So that this has been the most wonderful experience. It

240
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.700
really has and I came with my daughter-in-law Holly

241
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.000
and

242
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.100
on the first night when we

243
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.400
made the group before we made the groups. I told her

244
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.300
we are not going to be in the

245
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.000
same group.

246
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.600
And she kind of looked at me like what?

247
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.100
Well, I kind of like making new friends. Anyway, we

248
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.500
ended up staying in the same group. We were joined

249
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.400
by three other wonderful ladies. It was four

250
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.600
on the first night. We did have somebody come out

251
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.800
a long later on.

252
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.300
And it's just been amazing.

253
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.400
I've been thinking about what I was going to say and I really I almost want

254
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.100
to cry I really do it's it's means that

255
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:04.600
much.

256
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.800
We have a little text group. We text

257
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.600
throughout the week. We stay in

258
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.500
contact with each other a few weeks ago when we

259
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.400
didn't have the evening. We actually still

260
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.100
got together and we went out for dinner in.

261
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.300
It's just the friendships that

262
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.800
we've made the bonds.

263
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.400
And we are one of the groups that's going to carry on

264
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.300
and work further into the

265
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.100
Bible and grow together, and

266
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.600
we're a little scared about taking

267
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.100
that other step, but I

268
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.700
truly think that's something that we will do. This has been amazing. Thank

269
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.800
you. Thank you.

270
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.400
Okay.

271
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.400
By the way, you keep coming down during the testimony. So who's

272
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.000
that? We need somebody on this road right here.

273
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.300
Hello, my name is Gabriel Craig. I've been coming

274
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.100
to Henderson since about February of this year

275
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.900
whenever I moved to Oklahoma, so I'm originally

276
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.000
Missouri boy graduated college

277
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.400
recently and all my friends pretty much

278
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.300
like went in different directions. So it was really tough to

279
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.000
keep that community in person. And

280
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.500
I knew coming to Henderson and just experiencing some

281
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.600
of the community groups that Community was like something

282
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.200
that I really valued and then they started

283
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.100
the discipleship and I was like cool. I've been through a lot

284
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.400
of discipleship stuff. I also want to

285
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.600
just get to know more of the church body that I've

286
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.300
come to love already and it

287
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:39.900
was really cool because

288
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.400
When I first got placed into our micro

289
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.300
group, I was like man I am I'm like the youngest

290
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.100
guy here but like 30 years. So I was

291
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.100
like, I was just sponge mode just absorbing all the

292
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.300
wisdom that our guys brought to the table, but it was really awesome

293
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:56.700
that they were

294
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.500
they were vulnerable with me in my

295
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.200
past experiences and allowed me to share which

296
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.600
I thought wasn't going to be the case since I

297
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.200
had left my college friends and it was really cool to see

298
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.300
how we just bonded like we've been friends

299
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.500
forever. Like I said, I've only been here since February but

300
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.400
I feel like I've known these guys for years now and

301
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.200
it's just been awesome to see how God has

302
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.300
been moving through us through our group through. We just

303
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.200
text constantly and like someday some days at work. It's almost

304
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.200
just like the holy spirit is just like hey Gabe's not having a good day and

305
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.100
I just get a reach out from someone and it's just super awesome.

306
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.200
Just living the gospel out in our group and we have

307
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.300
plans to take what

308
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.300
we've learned here and Branch out and our different fields of

309
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.200
work outside of church and it's super cool to see

310
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.400
what all we are going to be doing and staying in

311
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.600
touch. So yeah great job.

312
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.700
My name is Brianna and I've been

313
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.500
coming to Henderson Hills for about four years

314
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:09.900
now.

315
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.300
And I'm the one that has the

316
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.500
screechy baby in the back. Sometimes she's very loud and

317
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.800
very very vocal. So the

318
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.600
first night I feel like I have to like preface everything

319
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.400
and talk about the before but the first night whenever he came

320
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.400
in and was like we're gonna make small groups and then called

321
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.500
people out for like wanting to leave out of the door. That was

322
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.000
me.

323
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.100
And I didn't do it but it like crossed my mind. I was like, how can I

324
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.300
leave without noticing I was like should I pinch the baby? She could

325
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.600
start crying I could leave like

326
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.200
I tried to figure out every way to get out but he called us

327
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.400
out and made me feel bad as I was like, okay, I'm gonna stay and then

328
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.300
Jenny came and she stood next kind of

329
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.200
to me. So I was like, okay, I have the baby. I have all my stuff. I can't walk very

330
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.500
far. So I stood next to Jenny and then Emily

331
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.400
joined us and Emily and I've known each other a little bit our boys

332
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.200
her youngest in my oldest or in

333
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.400
the same grade. So I was like, okay Lisa. I know someone like

334
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.000
Makes me feel a little bit better. So I had Emily Jenny

335
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.400
and then Lindy and I did not know Lindy or

336
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.300
really Jenny. I had just seen her around and we

337
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.600
just got to talking and

338
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.100
It was just I was so nervous at first but every

339
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.300
week we came back and we kind of joked that we were

340
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.200
the gold star group because we didn't miss a

341
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.200
single Wednesday for a very long time.

342
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.300
And at one point. My husband was like are you

343
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.300
giving yourself the gold star or is this like a known thing?

344
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.200
I was like, oh, we just think that ourselves we are giving ourselves the gold star

345
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.600
because our perfect attendance.

346
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.600
But anyways, we ended up not having perfect attendance,

347
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.000
but we did really good for a long time.

348
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.600
And anyway, so one day

349
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.800
after Wednesday, Lindy and I were talking and

350
00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.700
she was like, why don't you come try our community group and her

351
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.800
engineer actually in the same community group.

352
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.300
And so I said, yeah, we'll come try and

353
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.500
my husband and I we have a weird schedule. So we've been looking

354
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.500
but we've never found something that really worked or

355
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.700
clicked. But the first time we walked into Ginny and

356
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.000
Lindy's community group it was

357
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.200
Perfect. It felt like God's timing. He had

358
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.900
been having this group for us and we walked

359
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.400
in and we just felt at home and my husband's

360
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.500
like so we found our group right and I was like, yeah, and we ended

361
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.500
up joining just a couple weeks later. So this group not

362
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.100
only gave me those three friends, but it gave us

363
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.400
13 other couples.

364
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.500
That we're now friends with and part of a group. So, I

365
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.400
don't know that's like amazing to me that just this class has done

366
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.000
that from me wanting to escape out of the doors too. Now

367
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.700
a an amazing community group

368
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.500
of people. So I'm very thankful for that. Amen. Amen.

369
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.500
so, I don't know if you noticed but that is the

370
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.200
That's the pathway in the pathway doesn't just go

371
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.000
One Direction. Sometimes it goes other directions and Jimmy

372
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.400
Quinn who's our connections Pastor

373
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.200
brought me your your every

374
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.000
person who joins the church gets an interview and in

375
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.100
the interview, she said I I thought we'd found

376
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.300
our church, but when I got involved in a micro group, and then that became my

377
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.500
church and so I was hoping you'd share very good.

378
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.700
Come ahead.

379
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.100
Wow, it's really intimidating being up here on how you

380
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.600
do this. All of a suddenly. Wow, Lana Dickinson.

381
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.400
Glad to see you Phil. I have to say this has

382
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.900
been Joy because we have collectively gotten

383
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.200
to know you through this and it's been fun

384
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.300
to see your heart. We got to know Phil the

385
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.000
first day he was here and really got to hear his

386
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.600
heart for the church his heart for discipleship. And so

387
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.900
coming and doing this has been really really fun because we've

388
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.400
been able to sort of see your passion come

389
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.800
alive. So thank you for sharing it with us.

390
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.400
For us the micro group really was

391
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.500
a Divine appointment we connected

392
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.400
with some old friends that we had known from another community group.

393
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.400
We all got back together. It just so happened that we

394
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.100
kind of collectively had the eye roll when

395
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.300
When you said we had to do a micro group and so

396
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.000
we just joined together and it turned out to be just such

397
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.700
a sweet thing. God really

398
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.300
used this time to reconnect us. But

399
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.200
also it was at a critical time when we really needed the the

400
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.500
safety of the micro group because we

401
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.900
were all dealing with some some really intense things. So I'm

402
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.200
really grateful each week was a Divine appointment

403
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.200
and each week. We just saw God move and

404
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.000
deepen and so we all have a different direction we're going

405
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.300
to go but we're really grateful that you sort of

406
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.400
made us do this and that you told us

407
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.400
we we had to stick to it. And then you you kind of told us

408
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.300
that we really needed to seek the Holy Spirit on this so and we

409
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.500
have and we're grateful that you kind of gave us

410
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.400
the kick to do it.

411
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.400
Very good. Good job, Atlanta.

412
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.300
We're not keeping score but the girls are way ahead

413
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:18.800
gentlemen.

414
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:20.700
but

415
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.100
No, the I will make it while we're waiting

416
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.400
for the next person to come forward. I'll make a couple of observations and

417
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.500
that is that the bigger

418
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.300
groups are more comfortable.

419
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.700
and the smaller groups are a little more intimidating and

420
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.800
that we did have people walk out because it

421
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.500
was too much to ask and

422
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.500
one of the elders

423
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.500
You know, I hadn't been here very long. So you got to keep those Elders happy

424
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.100
amen. And so one of

425
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.300
the elders came to me the very first night he goes. You know, what?

426
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.400
Took a lot of Courage.

427
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.300
He didn't say it was a bad idea just said it took a lot of Courage, right

428
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.400
and anyway, and sure enough. I was

429
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.700
praying that it would go the way that it has and isn't it?

430
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.100
Good to see how God is at work in the lives of

431
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.700
his people.

432
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.000
And isn't it sad to know?

433
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.400
The will not allow him to work in ways that he wants to

434
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.500
because we're not comfortable with being

435
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.300
uncomfortable. And so when we step out

436
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:24.900
in faith

437
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.200
It's kind of like the mission field, you know, if you wanted to

438
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.500
go where it was comfortable the the word would never spread but you

439
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.100
go out in faith and you believe and you find and you're in

440
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.100
a different culture, and it's not comfortable and you have to learn a little language and before you

441
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.000
know it it's your calling and it feels like home.

442
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.100
So anybody else? I'll hold

443
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.900
this for a little bit longer.

444
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.700
Don't all Rush at the same time looked like

445
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.500
a stampede. Come on. Yeah. All right. The fellows

446
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.200
are making a comeback.

447
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.200
Hello, my name is Marcus Hernandez in I have

448
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.900
to say God.

449
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.400
God had used this small group to

450
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.400
encourage my life tremendously when the first

451
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.500
night came and Phil said, okay, those ones

452
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.300
are gonna lead, please stand on the side

453
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:19.600
and then everybody else go ahead and select someone go

454
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.400
up and meet one of the the

455
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.300
leaders on the side. I thought oh, that's

456
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.800
a bad idea because I thought I'm gonna be like pick

457
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.300
me, you know,

458
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.100
but God did brought amazing people to

459
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.800
our group with Bob Conrad.

460
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.700
And Bob Delano and it's just

461
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.200
been a blessing to to have these

462
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:47.100
older gentle and actually poor him to my life and he's

463
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.100
just been great being able to

464
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.100
talk to them and get together and pray for each other

465
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.100
and encourage each other and as we were

466
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.200
talking we also saw we you know, I don't know, how am I

467
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.100
gonna do this? Probably just gonna pray and ask God just

468
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.400
to bring people to my life and sure enough. I got

469
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.800
a text from my son-in-law.

470
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.000
He said hey Marcus, would you

471
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:09.600
like to get together?

472
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.700
All right, though.

473
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.600
Yes, let's get together. So for me

474
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.100
to say that I have the privilege to

475
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.600
get together with my son-in-law.

476
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.400
To share the gospel to encourage each other.

477
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.200
It's just been a blessing. So I'll take that opportunity anytime

478
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.300
and then I'm getting together

479
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.400
with a couple of guys from rcg and eventually I

480
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.400
hope that we can all continue doing

481
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.600
this. It's been a blessing and thank God

482
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:38.700
for

483
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.200
for this opportunity to do the small groups.

484
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.000
Thank you Marcus. Good. Yeah.

485
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.500
All right. Who else?

486
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.100
going once

487
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.400
So tonight we're

488
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.500
talking about multiply your life going twice.

489
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.400
Jesus' disciples committed to the Great Commission

490
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.200
and were empowered by the Holy Spirit and the movement that Jesus

491
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.900
started is still moving forward still growing ever-expanding

492
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.800
to the ends of the Earth. You

493
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.800
guys know that Matthew wrote that when the

494
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.400
when all the nations have heard the gospel, then the

495
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.900
end will come and he's going to accomplish this through discipleship.

496
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.300
Did you know that this week for the first time in

497
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.200
human history eight billion people now inhabit the

498
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.300
planet and there's no way a church can grow fast enough

499
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.300
to reach everybody. But if one person would multiply

500
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.300
themselves every year it would happen within the next 15

501
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:40.600
years.

502
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.600
So, can you join this movement? The Amper answer

503
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.500
is simple multiply your life by making examples.

504
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.800
Here's just a real quick. Graphic. This is

505
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.400
the your quad. This is your micro

506
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.400
group. And if everyone does that you can just see that any

507
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.400
in less than a year. We'll have I don't

508
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.700
know how many of you are going to do it, but just from one to 36 in

509
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.300
one year.

510
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.200
I want to read to you something that

511
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.800
kind of.

512
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.400
It moved me

513
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.900
when I began to see the the heart of

514
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.900
my savior. He knows all he's

515
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.700
100% God and 100% man.

516
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.600
But in this passage, we see what something that

517
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.400
pleases him something that makes him smile one day.

518
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.300
We all hope to hear well done my good and faithful

519
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.700
servant and I'm going to show you how you can make that happen and Jesus

520
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.700
sins 72 with directions. Okay,

521
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.100
he sends them. It's kind of like what we

522
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.500
did on the first night. We're gonna put you in micro groups and you're like, oh but

523
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.300
they return look at verse 17

524
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.200
the 72 returned with joy.

525
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.800
So they come back and they find the joys. We have found it Lord. Even

526
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.300
the demons are subject to us in your name and he

527
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.700
said to them. Oh look at here.

528
00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.100
y'all

529
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.600
Have mercy all right, keep them coming. Is that what you if

530
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.900
it's you you've got to stop?

531
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:07.400
Okay.

532
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.100
If I found out who it is, there's gonna be there's gonna be problems.

533
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:12.700
All right.

534
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.800
No, I should answer it.

535
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.400
Oh, this is my mom. Yeah, okay.

536
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.200
by the way, she loves talk to me every

537
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.900
evening and so

538
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.400
We're not gonna do FaceTime

539
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.600
Okay, here we go, and it might happen another six times so we'll

540
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.300
laugh every time okay.

541
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.800
And Jesus said to them I saw Satan

542
00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.900
fall like lightning from heaven.

543
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.200
Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and

544
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.200
scorpions and over the power of the enemy and nothing shall hurt. You

545
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.900
nevertheless do not rejoice in this that the

546
00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.700
spirits are subject to you, but Rejoice that

547
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.100
your names are written in heaven.

548
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.100
And look at verse 21. This is that this is where kind of my heart left a little

549
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.300
bit. This is Jesus in that same hour. He rejoiced

550
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.000
in the Holy Spirit.

551
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.200
Seeing them come back and seeing them rejoicing.

552
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.400
The the Holy Spirit has worked through them to impact the lives

553
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.600
of people who needed it.

554
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.300
Said I thank you Father Lord of Heaven and Earth

555
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.300
that you've hidden these things from the wise and understanding

556
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.900
and revealed them to Little Children. Yes Father for such

557
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.100
was your gracious will so what if

558
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.200
God through the power of

559
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.400
the holy spirit is igniting a movement in US?

560
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.900
That we understand what it looks like.

561
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.300
Step out of our comfort zone to do something that makes us

562
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.400
feel uncomfortable even awkward and then see

563
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.400
God doing something special and to know that that brings

564
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.400
us joy and that it brings Jesus Joy is

565
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.900
enough for me. Okay?

566
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.400
now

567
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.500
What are we going to do next?

568
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.200
Well, I think that's all I think that's what we're gonna do.

569
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.300
This will be your last time to meet with your micro group. Unless

570
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.500
you guys are keeping on going Joe. Did you want to say something this evening?

571
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.400
All right. Well let Joe McKinney my minister of Youth

572
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.300
by the way, he asked me and I held I

573
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.100
was and the answer is too old to be in the

574
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.000
youth group. But anyway, come on ahead Joe.

575
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.200
I know that some of you were choked up.

576
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.400
greater

577
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.200
That has grown to such a man

578
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.800
of influence.

579
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.700
integrity

580
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.300
character

581
00:29:59.300 --> 00:29:59.800
did you know?

582
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.400
That in your micro group.

583
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.000
There may be a young Christian.

584
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.800
Just like this guy was in the eighth grade.

585
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.100
pray that it's not in your group, but

586
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.900
When he was getting the call from surely his mother I

587
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.700
I thought he

588
00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.500
says this what are you doing this? That's something

589
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.900
that he would have done in the

590
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.600
eighth grade.

591
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.900
our first group

592
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.000
all were eighth graders.

593
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.700
out of that group came pastors

594
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:38.900
staff members

595
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.100
missionaries

596
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.400
lawyers

597
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.200
district attorney

598
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:49.700
congressman

599
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.900
the influence that you can have

600
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.900
from the micro groups

601
00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.100
from the small group that you create.

602
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.200
You can't imagine the influence that could

603
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:05.300
have.

604
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.800
And think if that was happening.

605
00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.400
Not 10 or 12 groups.

606
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.200
But a hundred or two hundred groups, sorry.

607
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:18.500
and

608
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.600
I know it's intimidating and it's scary.

609
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.100
I find it easier to stand in front of a whole big group than

610
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.400
being in a group of four

611
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:33.800
but I

612
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.000
I was just

613
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.700
thinking my pastor often says

614
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.800
I'm more afraid.

615
00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.600
of missed opportunities

616
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.200
then change

617
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.400
being uncomfortable

618
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.800
is change that's different for you. You're uncomfortable.

619
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.000
You're out of your comfort zone.

620
00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.100
And that's hard.

621
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.900
But I'd be more afraid.

622
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.500
of a missed opportunity

623
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.900
And he didn't ask me to say this and it may be run conflict

624
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:10.100
with.

625
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.900
but at some point

626
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.400
especially and I don't know that there is

627
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.500
but can you see a brand new Christian?

628
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.000
by the way, how

629
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.600
how much ahead of somebody do you have to be to lead

630
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:26.600
them?

631
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.100
Well, you have to you can't go somewhere. You've never been right?

632
00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.800
But you have to be one step. That's right.

633
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.400
That one step.

634
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.800
A young Christian could get together three others that

635
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.000
may be brand new Christians or maybe lost.

636
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.100
And he asked somebody else to come in and lead the group.

637
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.200
Can you imagine what could happen out of that?

638
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.800
But it may or may not happen in the large group.

639
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.100
I've got a group of guys that I'm teaching in the

640
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.000
morning at 6 o'clock.

641
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.800
And we're studying through the book of Hebrews.

642
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.400
and the last

643
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.100
my section that I'm teaching

644
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.500
tomorrow is the last few verses of chapter 5 in

645
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.100
the first eight verses of chapter 6.

646
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.700
and the passage in

647
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.500
chapter 6

648
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.800
has been said by most as the most controversial passage

649
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.900
in all of scripture.

650
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.700
But it follows.

651
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.000
The preacher who's written the letter to Hebrews these

652
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.000
Jewish Christians.

653
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.400
wherefore at a time

654
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.100
that you ought to be teaching others.

655
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.300
You have a need to be taught yourself.

656
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.300
And the lady who shared I've been in church

657
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:55.800
all my life.

658
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.300
I've heard about discipleship.

659
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.400
But I didn't know how to make disciples.

660
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.200
What a great thing to learn

661
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:05.500
now.

662
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.500
And I've discovered that you know, you become a

663
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.300
Christian and for the first maybe months or

664
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:13.800
years.

665
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.000
You're just learning.

666
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:17.900
about your conversion

667
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.900
You're learning what it means to be a Christian.

668
00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.600
And then you begin to grow more.

669
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.200
And you begin to have quiet times.

670
00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.300
and memorize scripture

671
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.500
learn how to share your faith

672
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.200
and that's a growing disciple.

673
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.500
But listen you haven't arrived.

674
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.800
Till you start making disciples.

675
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.400
And so I am so thrilled.

676
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.800
With what God's doing here.

677
00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.800
at Henderson Hills

678
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.700
and how he's using my boy.

679
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.000
to impact your lives

680
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.400
Thank you, buddy. Thank you.

681
00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.500
How long did he go? He said it was more than five. I'm

682
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.400
not counting. Hey, I want us to pray together and then

683
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.100
meet together with your micro group and I'll come

684
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.400
and remind you about 40 minutes, but it's 7:30. Okay, let's pray

685
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.400
father. Thank you so much for what you're doing in the life

686
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:19.700
of our church.

687
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.300
I love to dream about what you could do through

688
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.400
the power of your spirit and through our obedience Lord. I

689
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.800
love to hear stories in a year about what you've done and how

690
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.200
you begin to multiply disciples in

691
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.200
our church Lord. We don't want us

692
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:36.600
to talk about this.

693
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.000
We want to experience it.

694
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.800
And we want to see you rejoice in

695
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.900
our obedience and in the fruit that you bring.

696
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.500
Lord You're a good God and in just 12 weeks we've

697
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.200
seen you do Miracles and we're we're thankful for that. And so we

698
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.300
Rejoice tonight be with these groups Lord. Let them

699
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.300
some are closing up this evening and some are

700
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.200
just getting started but be with them and speak through them in Jesus name.

701
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:00.600
Amen.

702
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.100
I hate to interrupt anything that's happening right now,

703
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.400
but it is almost 7:30 and I wanted to take a couple minutes before

704
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.900
we officially wrap this up.

705
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.200
So you can push pause on whatever you're talking

706
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.600
about for a second and then you can continue after in a moment, but

707
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.100
I just wanted to say before you all there

708
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.200
were a couple people slipped out, but I wanted to say before all

709
00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.100
of you left just

710
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.400
There are a few times in a role.

711
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.700
Like I have like Phil has like others have that you are

712
00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.800
just really proud of what God is doing.

713
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.900
And tonight's one of those and this whole semester has

714
00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.700
been one of those for me as I've watched. God used

715
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.200
Phil and use you all.

716
00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.300
To do what you've seen God do and you heard

717
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.300
glimpses of that tonight, you know, even if

718
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.200
you didn't share what God's done in your heart in this season.

719
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.500
And whether you continue as a group now or not you

720
00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.700
now have the tools you feel hopefully more

721
00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.200
equipped and trained to be able to do what we've done here

722
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.500
tonight to continue the ministry of God's spirit

723
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.700
through his people.

724
00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.600
Through his word through the church all of

725
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.200
that because as you've heard tonight about the

726
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.400
movement, the idea comes from God's word first,

727
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.000
but then as as we've heard from our vision and our our idea

728
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.500
of what God wants to do is to be a church

729
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.600
that glorifies him by becoming this hub for an

730
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.500
all ages disciple making movement.

731
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.500
And that word movement is just that it multiplies and multiplies and

732
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.400
multiplies out Generations.

733
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.400
And as you know compound interest and all

734
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.900
of that takes off whenever you start to multiply multiplication,

735
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.800
and that's the goal is that we can't reach Edmonds.

736
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.400
We can't reach Oklahoma City. We can't reach the

737
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.000
state. We can't reach the nation. We can't reach the world without multiplication happening.

738
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.600
And that's what this is. Hopefully sparking in

739
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.100
us that that what you're doing right now is becoming the

740
00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.900
norm rather than the exception at

741
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.500
Henderson Hills.

742
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.100
That this becomes what we all do.

743
00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.300
I mean, I'm tomorrow morning six. Am I got my group going and

744
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.200
that this is what we do rather than like what

745
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.300
what are you doing? What what this group of three four people? What

746
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.100
what is that? Exactly tell us that this is just who we

747
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:17.400
are.

748
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.100
Because it's really where the life change.

749
00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.700
In most cases will happen.

750
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.500
So I just want to say thank you from my position for

751
00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.400
what you have invested in and just dove into

752
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.900
without even knowing what you're diving into us. Brianna said

753
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.500
earlier just the opportunities to

754
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.100
do this on a Wednesday night take advantage of the

755
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.200
time use this semester Just To See

756
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.200
God do something in you first and then through you

757
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.900
into other people you can see you're a minister you're used

758
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.200
by God in each other's lives.

759
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.100
So don't take that lightly.

760
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.700
I don't take that opportunity for granted.

761
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.000
But realize that there are a lot

762
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.200
of people sitting in this room on a Sunday or in

763
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.400
your community groups that don't have anything like

764
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.300
this it is scary it is intimidating but there's

765
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.400
there's a step of Faith taken that you have taken

766
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.600
and you are just one step ahead of where they are and

767
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.900
you can see what God did in you what you can see happen in

768
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.100
them, that's what our prayer is I want to kind of

769
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.400
commission you tonight a little bit with that with the the idea

770
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.300
to say let's let's see this expand and

771
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.100
multiply into our church just normal

772
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.800
This is just who we are as disciples We

773
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.800
Make Disciples intentionally.

774
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.500
And so you can go as we talk about your scent. You

775
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.600
can go sent by the Lord from this place either to

776
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.300
continue your group or to start new groups. However, the Lord

777
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.500
leads but we're behind you. We're for you.

778
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:48.300
I'm excited to be a part of this with you. It's an

779
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.300
honor really is to see how God has moved in this way.

780
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.500
So thank you Phil for leading this for the last 12 weeks and

781
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.100
we're grateful for all of you besting in it. Let

782
00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.400
me pray for us and then you can continue and and be done tonight God

783
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.100
we're grateful.

784
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.800
What a gift it is to be a part.

785
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.200
of your work in this world

786
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.400
You don't have to use us.

787
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.300
but you've chosen to

788
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.500
And what an honor?

789
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.100
What a privilege.

790
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.500
So I pray for each one of these and those who've already

791
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.800
left tonight those who couldn't be here tonight.

792
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.600
I pray that they would feel.

793
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.200
just feel your

794
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.600
your love for them.

795
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.500
Your presence with them like Matthew 28 says Jesus. You're never gonna

796
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.400
leave us alone in this journey.

797
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.100
You have the authority you have.

798
00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.200
Or have our devotion and you are with us and so we

799
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.100
know that you will use that.

800
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.100
So help us Lord.

801
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.200
For those who feel intimidated by starting out a new

802
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.300
group.

803
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:50.900
Give them courage.

804
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.400
For those who feel ashamed because of their past

805
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.200
give them freedom.

806
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.300
For those who?

807
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.900
Want to be used by You For Your Glory God

808
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:04.800
give them opportunities.

809
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.300
Thank you again for this time that we've had.

810
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.700
May not stop here tonight.

811
00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.300
This is not just a class. This is not something

812
00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.600
we can check the box off. This is a launching pad.

813
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.600
To your ministry in this church and by extension

814
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.700
into our city to change Edmund into

815
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.300
our metropolitan area to change

816
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.400
Oklahoma City and then into the nation's including our

817
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.100
own this is what you want to do through us.

818
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.700
where who knows where that one person in our micro group

819
00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.500
our D group can

820
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.200
can take a step of faith. We can't take right now in our lives

821
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.700
and we can see them go to an unreached people group and change

822
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.500
lives there and seek God work and

823
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.400
miraculous ways. Who knows God?

824
00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.100
What you're going to do through this as we're faithful, it's all

825
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.000
you want from us is faithfulness obedience worship.

826
00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.100
So we pray to give it to you we would give it to

827
00:41:59.100 --> 00:41:59.200
you.

828
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.300
Both in worship Gatherings, but also every moment

829
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.000
of every day you're worthy of it.

830
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.200
Thank you again. What a gift to my soul. This

831
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.400
has been to see tonight and to see this semester. You are

832
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.200
good to us. God may we

833
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.800
give our lives in response in Jesus name? Amen? Amen. Love

834
00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.700
you all. Thank you. You are sent.
