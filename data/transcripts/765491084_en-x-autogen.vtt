1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.500
God like Yahweh the god

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.400
of wrath the god of Mercy The

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.800
God Who reaches down to unworthy

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.000
people.

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.300
Well, good morning church. If you are new here,

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.300
we're thankful that you would take a step to gather with us and

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.300
really a step of Faith to show up at

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.100
a new place. We'd love to get to meet you. So please let us know who you

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.300
are. You can come and introduce yourself to one of us or you

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.600
can use that card or the QR code right in front of you and just

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.200
to let us know you're here so we can get to know you and how we

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.200
can care for you and love you as best. We can

13
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.200
that's our desire today. We're continuing through

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.000
our journey in the Book of Micah in

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.200
the Old Testament finishing up chapter six today. And so

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.600
take your copy of God's word and turn there with me Micah chapter

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.300
six and we'll be verses 9 through

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.800
16.

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.500
In chapter 6 now before we get into it today.

20
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.900
I want to say upfront. This is a tough passage. It's heavy.

21
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.500
But it's always amazing to me as as I watch God

22
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.700
work all of this out because I had planned these

23
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.500
series of sermons for months ago.

24
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.700
And what today was going to be this passage, but

25
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.500
then also we have the Lord's Supper that we do just every few

26
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.400
weeks and it kind of happens to all go together today

27
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.800
and it's really just amazing to watch you'll see what I mean as

28
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.200
you go in this but just it's fun to be a part of what

29
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.700
God's doing.

30
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.200
but as we get into it today and kids this might be

31
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.300
really easy for you to do but I want us all

32
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300
to think back to those times in our lives when we were kids and

33
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.500
we went through growth spurts, right, you know, I'm talking about and

34
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.800
and so think about that as you went through that season

35
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.700
where your bones and your muscles were lengthening your you're

36
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.500
getting taller your outgrowing pants

37
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.200
and like a week, you know, those kind of things as you're growing

38
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.300
through these growth spurts, but one of the other signs of a growth

39
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.300
spurt is that you're always hungry

40
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.100
You remember how that was when you were a kid, you're always hungry and you're

41
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.400
eating like 30 minutes after lunch because

42
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.100
you're hungry already and my mom. I don't know where this came from.

43
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.900
She asked if I had a Hollow Leg for a while. Not sure what that means. But maybe

44
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.000
your mom did the same.

45
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.300
Where you're just burning through cereal boxes, it just seems like that's all

46
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.200
you're eating and four hamburgers at lunch and it's just

47
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.400
the way it is burning through your bank account really if you're trying to feed a

48
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.800
teenager in that way.

49
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.900
But as a growing child, you never feel satisfied.

50
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300
You never can eat enough to fill that pit. That

51
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.000
is just seeming to be bottomless.

52
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.300
Well in reality sadly a lot

53
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.300
of people are walking around with the same

54
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.100
feeling spiritually.

55
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.500
See we are constantly searching for ways to

56
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.600
fill a void inside of us.

57
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.900
That we so often turn to substances or

58
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.000
to sex or to wealth or to

59
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.300
travel or to pornography or or

60
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.800
to whatever else it is. We're trying to fill this void. We're

61
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.300
trying to fulfill this hunger this this

62
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.200
satisfaction desire we have in our souls. We're trying

63
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.500
to fill it with all of these things.

64
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.500
yet most people as I've just indicated look

65
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.800
for that kind of satisfaction that fulfillment in everything

66
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.700
but the Lord

67
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.000
We look in all these other places for that kind of

68
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.700
fulfillment.

69
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.500
And hear me, even we as Christians can do that.

70
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.600
Now as Christians we might overlay of a spiritual veneer

71
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.400
over those things and we think we're saying the

72
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.200
right things and we we look one way but inside of us,

73
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.400
we're still searching when you really drill down to

74
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.500
the core we're searching for satisfaction in

75
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.400
the same way that most unbelievers out. There are searching for

76
00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.700
it.

77
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.600
For constantly searching for more or better or higher or

78
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.700
faster and we're looking for that to satisfy

79
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.100
us.

80
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.300
And so what we all need to see today.

81
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.500
Is the truth that Augustine wrote 1500 years

82
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.700
ago.

83
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.400
Something he said to God. He said you have made us

84
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.500
for yourself, and we will not find

85
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.700
rest until we find rest in you.

86
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.000
Augustine understood

87
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.100
As he prayed this to God you have made us for yourself God

88
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.300
and we will not find rest until we

89
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.500
find rest in you.

90
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.400
And we'll see that today in Micah 6.

91
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.800
verses 9 through 16

92
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.300
The voice of the Lord Christ to the city it is

93
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.000
sound wisdom to fear your name.

94
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.100
Here of the rod and if him who appointed it.

95
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.100
Can I forget any longer the treasures of wickedness In The House of the

96
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.400
wicked?

97
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.700
And the scant measure that is a cursed.

98
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.300
Shall I acquit the man with Wicked scales and with a

99
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.800
bag of deceitful weights?

100
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.600
Your rich men are full of violence. You're inhabitants speak lies

101
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.300
their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.

102
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.300
Therefore this is God speaking. I strike you with

103
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.500
a grievous blow.

104
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.600
Making you desolate because of your sins.

105
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.200
You shall eat but not be satisfied. There should be

106
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.000
hunger within you.

107
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.700
You shall put away but not preserve and what

108
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.500
you preserve. I'll give to the sword you shall sow but

109
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.400
not reap you shall tread olives, but not anoint yours

110
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.400
with oil you shall tread grapes, but not drink wine.

111
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.600
For you have kept the statutes of Omri.

112
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.200
And all the works of the House of Ahab and you've walked

113
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200
in their counsels.

114
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.500
That I may make you a desolation and your inhabitants

115
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.600
a hissing meaningless a scorn. So you

116
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.600
shall bear the scorn of my people.

117
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.900
God we look at this text and we see such heaviness we

118
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.500
see judgment. So I pray you show us

119
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.300
today what you want us to see about us even

120
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.000
How you spoke to them how you saw them and how

121
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.100
we can learn from that?

122
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.300
Convict us where we need it.

123
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.600
And may we find our satisfaction arrest in

124
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.200
you alone?

125
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.200
In Jesus name we pray help us.

126
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.900
amen

127
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.500
And so remember where we landed last week where we had God bringing

128
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.900
a legal case against his people because they

129
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.800
had abandoned the Covenant. They had forgotten his

130
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.100
grace they'd live by their own standard. They said we're going

131
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.900
to do it our way.

132
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.400
They thought they were okay though, because they had the temple

133
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.700
in their neighborhood. They thought that they were they were

134
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.700
doing all the religious rituals. They needed to do to appease God

135
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.400
they assumed they supposed to be doing these things. And so they're

136
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.600
like we're okay, right God

137
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.900
But God said no.

138
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.200
Instead you ought to be living according to my standard and that was

139
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.300
the standard he gave in Micah six eight where he says you need to be acting justly

140
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.700
you need to love faithfulness and need

141
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.900
to walk humbly with your God.

142
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.200
And so he brought this case to them and saying you have not done this

143
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.800
and the results of that are here in 9 through 16.

144
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.500
So the the indictments been brought now we see here's

145
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.000
the Judgment. Here's what God is going to bring on them

146
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.100
for abandoning. His Covenant for abandoning

147
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.800
God's standard.

148
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.300
That's what he was showing them here is that guys you have abandoned my

149
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.500
standard and hears. What happens when

150
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.300
you do that? Here's what happens when you take Micah 6:8

151
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.200
throw it in the garbage when you say I don't want

152
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.300
to I don't want to take your requirement God. I

153
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.200
want to take my own way, and I'm going to live this direction.

154
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.100
Well, God says here's what's going to happen.

155
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.900
Here's what happens when you abandon God's standard.

156
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.300
First thing he says is that we end up

157
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.900
following the foolishness of idols.

158
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.300
When we set God standard aside, we follow the

159
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.100
foolishness of idols.

160
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.500
Now this happened all over the book of Mike already, right? We've seen this over and over.

161
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.200
It's actually one of the main themes of the prophets in the Old Testament.

162
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.600
talking about idolatry

163
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.300
but specifically here Micah is referring to what we find

164
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.100
in the first half of verse 16 where he talks

165
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.700
about keeping the statutes of Omri following the works of Ahab. He's

166
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.900
referencing what their idolatry actually is. And

167
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.400
so what he's doing here, this is interesting these two names.

168
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.100
He says, he's comparing Judah remember

169
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.000
the southern Kingdom

170
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.000
He's comparing them to the Northern Kingdom of Israel that had

171
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.400
had these two of its

172
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.400
most wicked Kings of Omri and Ahab.

173
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.200
And so what he's saying to them is hey, remember Armory remember that

174
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.300
guy?

175
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.100
He led the people more than anybody else towards idolatry.

176
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.900
But then his son Ahab was even worse.

177
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.300
Because Ahab actually built a temple built an altar to

178
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.100
false gods. He married a foreign woman named

179
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.400
Jezebel who brought all these other prophets with her from

180
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.400
another nation, and then they had all the true prophets of

181
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:18.800
God killed.

182
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.400
He's like, hey remember those guys, of course, they would

183
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.200
of course Judah would know who they were. And so Micah says

184
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.500
the people of Judah are keeping the rules of

185
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.300
Omri. They're following all the

186
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.300
works of Ahab. What he's accusing them of

187
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.800
is the same kind of brutal idolatry.

188
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.000
He says guys you're no different.

189
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.200
Judah you are no different.

190
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.700
It's all over Micah.

191
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.700
That these people who are supposedly gods.

192
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200
Had turned away from him.

193
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.500
Had turned away from his Covenant and they were seeking their

194
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.400
peace and their joy and all of the other stuff the world

195
00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.000
could offer.

196
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.000
He says they should have feared God's name and followed the

197
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.300
one who would not lead them to foolishness. But instead they follow these

198
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.200
false gods these idols and that would lead them towards.

199
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.600
foolishness

200
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.400
and so from our perspective this far back this far

201
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.200
forward into we're looking back on them. We can think

202
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.400
well, of course, they were idolaters they had statues and

203
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.500
they had these things but we need to ask the question.

204
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.200
How do we follow Idols today?

205
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.500
Like what are Idols in our lives today?

206
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.300
Well, the definition of an idol is anything that takes the

207
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.100
rightful place of God in your heart.

208
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.700
It becomes ultimate in your heart over God we

209
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.200
try to find life in it. Try to find your peace and

210
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.300
joy in that thing, whatever it may be and so

211
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.100
you think about that implication. It can be all kinds of

212
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.800
things even good things.

213
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.400
It could be your sports team that you either play on or

214
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.200
cheer for.

215
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.100
It could be your kids activities become your Idol.

216
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.900
vocational success

217
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.000
A relationship that you have or or peer approval from

218
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.400
others that you were searching for

219
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.400
life in or political power you want this

220
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.700
or that even the Love of Money can turn

221
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.400
into an idol?

222
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.200
As first Timothy 6 verses 9 and 10

223
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.500
says he says Those Who desire to be rich fall into

224
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.500
temptation into a snare into many

225
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.600
senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin

226
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.200
and destruction.

227
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.100
For the Love of Money is a root of

228
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.300
all kinds of evils.

229
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.800
It is through this craving that's hunger,

230
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.200
right it is through this trying to

231
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.200
fill this hole with money that some have wandered away

232
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.800
from the faith.

233
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.600
and pierced themselves with many pangs

234
00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.600
The point here is that trying to fill this void this

235
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.300
hunger in our souls with anything, but the

236
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.200
Lord will only lead to destruction.

237
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.000
It's going to be fickle. It's going to be an unsustainable

238
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.300
foundation in your life. It's going to lead

239
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.800
to foolishness.

240
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.800
We turn away from the Lord's standard we lead to foolishness, but

241
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.500
we also see something in Micah 6.

242
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.600
verses 10 through 12 we turn away from the Lord like Judah

243
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:27.900
was doing

244
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.200
we we much more easily get to the point where we start to

245
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.000
deceive others.

246
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.600
We follow Idols, but then we start to deceive

247
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.000
others in our lives.

248
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.200
When you look at those three verses 10 through 12

249
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.600
overall what Micah was referring to was he was accusing people

250
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.300
in the marketplace of cheating other

251
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.500
buying and selling of using these

252
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.800
Wicked scales.

253
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.300
So think about this if they could sell you a bushel of

254
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:02.500
corn.

255
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.900
That that was using a bushel that

256
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.400
was only actually nine tenths of a bushel. You

257
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.500
couldn't really tell the difference.

258
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.000
But they still charge you three bucks for that bushel, right?

259
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.700
And so what they get is they get to have some extra income

260
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.600
out of that deal.

261
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.500
You could do the same thing with weights on a scale which is not they

262
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.200
didn't have cash registers, right so they had to weigh things out

263
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.600
that this was three shekels of silver to buy

264
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.000
this item and they would put a three and a half

265
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.400
shekel weight on the other side.

266
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.400
And you had to balance it out because you don't know that

267
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.700
that's not three shekels.

268
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.100
And you had to to find a little bit

269
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.000
more income a little bit more money and put it on the scale.

270
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.700
But think about how evil all that is, right?

271
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.500
It's so evil in the sense that that this

272
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.200
was primarily in the marketplace the people who

273
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.700
were coming to buy those things from those people were primarily

274
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.400
poor people and so they're on the backs of

275
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.200
the poor. They're just getting more money. They had no

276
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.500
choice but to buy the food from these people and they didn't know anything

277
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.100
different and and they had to do it if they wanted

278
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.400
to eat.

279
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.500
But those people were just in the back just raking in more

280
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.400
and more and more money.

281
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.700
But think about it again, where did that kind of Lifestyle come from?

282
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.900
Where did that decision to be unethical in

283
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.000
your scales and to be evil in your buying and

284
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.300
selling where did that kind of mentality come from?

285
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.600
It's because they turned away from God's Micah 6:8

286
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:35.900
standard.

287
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.300
They had said I'm I'm gonna abandon that we're gonna do this way. They

288
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.000
were supposed to act justly meaning be

289
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.300
fair. According to God's standard. They were

290
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.400
supposed to love faithfulness, especially to the Covenant brothers and sisters

291
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.700
in the land. They were supposed to be faithful and flourishing them.

292
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.900
And they were supposed to walk humbly with their God following

293
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.200
his holy pattern for life, but they

294
00:14:59.200 --> 00:14:59.700
said no.

295
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.800
It's not what we want.

296
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.500
They were committing injustices. They were

297
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.400
seeking their own benefit and they were not Walking With

298
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.200
God all of that came from turning away from God.

299
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.200
and his standard

300
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.200
but here's the thing about this especially this sin that he's talking about

301
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.300
specifically In this passage.

302
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.200
Those people were kind of in it together.

303
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.000
We think of the vendors in the marketplace. They

304
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.100
would have known that the others were doing this too. And

305
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.000
so they're like this guy over here is charging three and a

306
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.000
half ounces for that same thing. Well, if he can do it I can do it.

307
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.600
And if I don't he's gonna make more money than me.

308
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.300
So I want to so they're almost all in collusion in

309
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.000
this thing here.

310
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.700
But this is an example then of what we might call a respectable

311
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.200
sin.

312
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.200
Because honestly most people at that time those vendors especially were looking

313
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.500
at this like let's not that big a deal.

314
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.200
Well, we're just taking a little bit off the top

315
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.600
not it's kind of like the tax collectors. You know that they were just skimming a

316
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.100
little off the top not a big deal. Nobody's gonna

317
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.600
get hurt. We're just making a little extra money here a little spending money we need

318
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.800
but God in Proverbs 11:1 calls unjust

319
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.500
Waits on abomination.

320
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.000
That's a pretty strong word.

321
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.400
Like he says unjust Waits this idea of what they're doing. Here is

322
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.500
an abomination.

323
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.600
It's deceptive. It's evil.

324
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.300
And so no, we're not out here selling stuff and we're you know, all these things

325
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.700
and maybe you could apply that some way but but think think more

326
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.700
about the deception here.

327
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.200
We must not be okay with deception even

328
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.600
if everybody else is doing it. We can't

329
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.500
be okay with it.

330
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.800
If we are God's people we must be.

331
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.700
fleeing

332
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.700
things like cheating at school

333
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.700
But everybody else cheating at school is deceptive. It's

334
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.400
unjust Waits.

335
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.400
Unethical business practices that are just based on Greed and

336
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.400
you're just looking for more income.

337
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.700
Or you're lying to cover Your Tracks over whatever other things

338
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.200
or or you're working at home remotely and you're

339
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.300
taking advantage of that. You're being a little lazy here and there right. These

340
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.500
are all deceptive practices.

341
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.100
That God would say is turning away from him.

342
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.200
Now, why do we do those things?

343
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.800
We do those things because we're looking for something more.

344
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.400
We want a better grade. We want more money. We

345
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.100
want more time. We we have a hunger in

346
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.600
us that we're trying to fill with whatever

347
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.500
that is. But listen to what first John

348
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.300
says about what we should think that way he says

349
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.900
do not love the world or the things in the world.

350
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.300
If anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him

351
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.100
for all that is in the world the desires of

352
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.300
the flesh the desires of the eyes and the pride of

353
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.100
life is not from the father, but it's from the world.

354
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.800
And the world is passing away along with

355
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.100
its desires. But whoever does the will of

356
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.500
God abides forever first, John 2:15 through

357
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:22.800
17.

358
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.700
See again when we turn away from the Lord to

359
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.800
the things of this world.

360
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.400
We begin to live lives of selfish deception.

361
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.300
Because we're looking for something we're trying to find it here or there or

362
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.700
here or there and we begin to deceive to get it.

363
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.900
We must flee that attitude Church.

364
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.300
Because look back Micah 6 what God says

365
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.200
he's about to do to the people of Judah for what they've

366
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.500
been doing.

367
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.200
Micah 6:13, I will strike you with the

368
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.300
Grievous blow making you desolate because of your sins.

369
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.700
The end of verse 16 said it I will make you a desolation. You're

370
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.200
inhabitants a hissing. So you shall bear the

371
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.200
scorn of my people he is going to

372
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.100
judge his people for their sins.

373
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.400
He said just like the northern kingdom got

374
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.200
it. You've abandoned my Covenant and so here's what's coming.

375
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.500
But when we hear judgment from God, we typically

376
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.200
think like Hellfire Brimstone, you know, God's gonna just destroy everything.

377
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.400
Notice notice here what verses 14

378
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.400
and 15 say about this judgment.

379
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.500
In the illustrate this hunger I was talking about earlier, but this is the Judgment

380
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.300
God is bringing on them. Look at 14 and 15

381
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.600
again. He says you shall eat but not be satisfied.

382
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.600
There should be hunger within you you shall put away but not preserve

383
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.400
what you preserve. I'll give to the sword you shall so but

384
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.200
not reap tread olives, but not anoint yourself with oil

385
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.400
tread grapes, but not drink wine. You see

386
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.700
what God is saying here.

387
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.200
Is that when we turn away from God's standard part

388
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.900
of the Judgment we receive is emptiness.

389
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.500
We've turned away from God's standard the Judgment he brings

390
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.800
into our lives in part is emptiness.

391
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.400
See what this passage these two verses is known as

392
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.500
is a it's what we call in in theological terms a

393
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.500
futility curse.

394
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.500
Where God frustrates the normal expectations

395
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.300
of people he frustrates the

396
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.500
normal order of how things would work. Well normally

397
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.500
bless people is reversed into a curse.

398
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.700
That's what you saw eating will not satisfy.

399
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.500
Planting will not be followed by harvesting.

400
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.300
Treading on grapes will not result in wine storing up things will not

401
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.600
produce a savings. Nothing will happen as it's

402
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.100
supposed to happen.

403
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.600
Instead of what was supposed to happen? There will

404
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.000
be this gnawing hunger.

405
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.500
inside of the people instead

406
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.100
everything they think would fulfill them doesn't in the

407
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:14.500
end.

408
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.600
It's like what Jeremiah said about?

409
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.400
the people's idolatry Jeremiah 2 verses 11

410
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.200
through 13

411
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.800
He says has a nation changed its Gods even

412
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.100
though they are no gods.

413
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.200
My people have changed their glory for that which

414
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.400
does not profit be appalled. Oh heavens at

415
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.500
this be shocked to be utterly desolate. There's the word desolate again

416
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.500
declares the Lord for my people have committed two evils.

417
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.200
They have forsaken me the Fountain of

418
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.000
Living Waters turned away from me.

419
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.300
And they've hewed out or dug out cisterns. Those

420
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:56.100
are big containers of water in the ground for themselves broken cisterns

421
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.700
that can hold no

422
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.200
water.

423
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.500
Haggai, 1:6 says something similar you have sown much

424
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.600
and harvested little.

425
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.700
You eat, but you never have enough you drink,

426
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.700
but you never have your fill you clothe yourselves,

427
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.500
but no one is warm and he who earns wages

428
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.600
does so to put them into a bag with

429
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.500
holes.

430
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.000
so he's saying

431
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.900
you might have a lot.

432
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.100
But you never have enough.

433
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.700
Is that not true of our culture today?

434
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.300
We have so much but we never have enough. That's what he's talking to

435
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.200
them about. He's saying these broken sisters you're trusting

436
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.500
in. It's like a leaky bucket.

437
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.300
Like you got a bucket with a hole in the bottom. You keep feeling it up. It keeps leaking

438
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.300
out keep filling it up keeps leaking right or these these bag with

439
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.100
holes. He's talking about like you make money you toss it in

440
00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.600
there and it falls out the bottom in the hole. That's what he's illustrating our

441
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.600
idolatry.

442
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.100
Saying it's not worth.

443
00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.100
It's empty.

444
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.000
It's unsatisfying. But listen, this is what happens.

445
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.200
When we seek Abundant Life in the things of this

446
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.500
world.

447
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.400
In all of these other things whether that's material things and

448
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.100
stuff.

449
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.600
Or maybe it's immaterial things like relationships or

450
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.200
other promotions or or things like

451
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.400
we seek our life in things like that.

452
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.800
What happens is we start to react sinfully

453
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.100
when those things are challenged when those things are

454
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.300
lost when those things are broken when those things are

455
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.500
attacked we start to push back and we start to fight

456
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.900
because that is really what we're worshiping.

457
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.500
James 4 says this very clearly

458
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.200
says what causes corals what

459
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.700
causes fights among you is it not this that your

460
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.300
passions are at War within you?

461
00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.800
You desire and you don't have so you murder you

462
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.700
covet cannot obtain. So you fight and quarrel.

463
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.400
You do not have because you do not ask you

464
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.800
ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly to

465
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.900
spend it on your own Passions.

466
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.300
And so this quest for self-fulfillment.

467
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.000
It leads to endless dissatisfaction.

468
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.000
And so what do we do instead?

469
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.300
All of these things we're trying it's a leaky bucket. It's

470
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.700
an empty. It's a bag with holes. What do we searching for

471
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.100
if nothing else works?

472
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:42.900
Where do we turn?

473
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.100
Remember the Augustine quote at the beginning.

474
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.800
Where he said that God has made us for himself, and we

475
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.400
will not find rest until we find rest in

476
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:55.700
him.

477
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:57.700
There's your answer.

478
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.900
That's where we turn if we what we're looking for is rest.

479
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.300
That's where we turn we should turn to the one

480
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.800
who satisfies.

481
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.800
Turn to the one the capital o one who

482
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.700
satisfies.

483
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.500
Again, the point of this whole passage is to

484
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.800
reveal the futility of idols.

485
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.500
to reveal the foolishness of a

486
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.200
materialistic lifestyle

487
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.700
and so by implication then

488
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.200
God is saying to them and he's saying it to

489
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.000
us today.

490
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.600
That there is something better to choose from.

491
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.600
that there is something that will satisfy you

492
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.300
if he's saying all of this won't all of this won't all of

493
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.500
this won't that means there is something that will

494
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.200
And we need to turn over to the Gospel of John to see it.

495
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.300
So turn right from Micah over into the New Testament.

496
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.300
We're going to spend some time in the Book of John this morning as well.

497
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.300
John chapter 4.

498
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.700
Turn right few pages into the New Testament Matthew Mark

499
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.000
Luke, and then John.

500
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.500
starting chapter 4

501
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.600
to see where we should turn and that the reality

502
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.300
of this the scene setting here is that Jesus

503
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.200
was passing through Samaria one time

504
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.300
and he sits down at this well, and he meets this woman.

505
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.600
Samaritan woman

506
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.200
but I want you to see their interaction here. Look at John chapter 4 starting

507
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.900
in verse 7.

508
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.300
Really read down through verse 15 and we'll see what happens as he

509
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:40.800
meets her.

510
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.300
And listen for the things that we've been saying so far.

511
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.900
He says a woman from Samaria came to draw water.

512
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.500
And Jesus said to her give me a drink.

513
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.600
For his disciples are gone away to the city to buy food and the Samaritan

514
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.300
woman said to him. How is it that you a Jew? Ask

515
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.700
for a drink from me? A woman of Samaria for Jews

516
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.900
have no dealings with Sumerians.

517
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.300
Jesus answered her if you knew the gift of God who

518
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.300
it is that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him

519
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.200
and he would have given you living water.

520
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.300
And the woman said to him sir, you have nothing to

521
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.600
draw water with and the well is deep. Where do you get that Living Water?

522
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.500
Are you greater than our father Jacob he gave us this well and drank for

523
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.900
himself as did his sons and his livestock.

524
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.300
And Jesus said to her everyone who drinks of this water the well

525
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.700
water will be thirsty again.

526
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.300
But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never

527
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.300
be thirsty again.

528
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.300
The water that I give him will become in him

529
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.200
a spring of water welling up to eternal

530
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:44.800
life.

531
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.500
The woman said to him sir. Give me this water so that

532
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.500
I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.

533
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.300
And so notice what Jesus was doing in the scene?

534
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.700
He was showing her this tangible illustration.

535
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.200
He was saying to her that if you keep coming back to this

536
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.500
well again, and again, you're still going to be thirsty.

537
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.300
You keep coming to that thing that you think's going to satisfy. You

538
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.700
have to keep returning. It will never relieve your thirst.

539
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.800
It's actually in here.

540
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.700
It's only when you drink from the living water.

541
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.600
Will that thirst be quenched?

542
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.000
And so keep that in mind and just turn one or two pages to the

543
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.500
right over to John chapter 6.

544
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.200
We'll keep that one and we're going to see something else here in John chapter

545
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.400
6 now. Jesus said in between these scenes, he'd

546
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.200
miraculously fed 5,000 people with a Hebrew Happy

547
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.500
Meal. He'd walked on the water. And so he's he's shown

548
00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.900
off these big things that he's done.

549
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.300
And the next day after that the crowd found him and

550
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.300
they wanted more of what he was offering.

551
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:52.900
They were hungry, right?

552
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.400
You eat once this day the next day you're going to be hungry again. And so

553
00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.400
Jesus said this John chapter 6 verse 26

554
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.500
Jesus answered them truly I say to you you are seeking

555
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.800
me not because you saw signs, but

556
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.200
because you ate your fill of the

557
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.000
loaves.

558
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.400
Not because you saw that Messiah was here. It's because

559
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:19.900
you're hungry.

560
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.500
And so Jesus flipped the script on them and instead said

561
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.600
this look at verse 35.

562
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.800
He said I am the bread of life.

563
00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.700
Whoever comes to me shall not hunger whoever believes

564
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.600
in me. Shall never thirst. Now. It

565
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.200
sounds a lot like what he told the woman at the well, right.

566
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.200
So this is just right here together. Now, of course, the people are

567
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.000
confused by that.

568
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.000
Like what do you mean this bread that I'm never gonna be hungry how because their

569
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.600
context was that God had fed, the Israelites in

570
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.300
the wilderness with Manna Heavenly bread that they

571
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.400
had been provided for that that was their satisfaction. And

572
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.600
so they're thinking that as the true bread

573
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.600
Look at what Jesus responds to them with in

574
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.300
verse 48 down through 51.

575
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.600
He says I am the bread of life.

576
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.400
Your father's ate the man in the wilderness and they

577
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:13.700
died.

578
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.300
This is the bread that comes down from heaven. So that

579
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.400
one may eat of it and not die. I am the living

580
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.500
bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of

581
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.800
this bread, he will live forever.

582
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.700
And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my

583
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.500
flesh.

584
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.200
And so check this out here here. We're tying it all together. Now with the

585
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.600
what Jesus said to the woman at the well in verse four about

586
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.100
the water and then here in chapter 6 with the people

587
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.400
in the bread. It's the same thing. He's that we've been saying all day

588
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.500
today in this sermon.

589
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.600
By the way, it's the same thing that the Book of Ecclesiastes says.

590
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.100
Which says that everything under the sun?

591
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.600
Everything on this Earth is limited. It's

592
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.100
unsatisfying you could try it all and you

593
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.500
still wouldn't have that void filled in your heart. And

594
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.800
so what it says what Jesus is saying here in

595
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.400
four and six of chasing after the

596
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.300
things under the sun that won't fulfill us.

597
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.400
Essentially. What we need to do is we need to get over the Sun.

598
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.400
And you understand that we're searching here under the

599
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.700
sun and none of it's gonna work. We got to get over the sun

600
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.200
where true life is actually hidden.

601
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.200
We're satisfaction is found where eternity begins Jesus

602
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.600
said himself John 6:27. He

603
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.400
says don't work for the food that perishes that bread

604
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.900
before that they died with but for the food that endures to

605
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.800
eternal life.

606
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.900
Which the son of man will give to you?

607
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.600
What he's saying again?

608
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.200
Nothing else will satisfy.

609
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.100
Even the bread from Heaven that they got in the

610
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.200
wilderness was not enough.

611
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.500
They still died. They still had to have more and more

612
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:00.600
and more.

613
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.800
None of it anything else is enough to satisfy

614
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.500
what these people needed. What we need is to

615
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.700
trust in the living Bread of Life come down from heaven Jesus

616
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.300
Christ. The one who gave his life for our

617
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:14.900
eternal life.

618
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.400
Again, the point of all of this.

619
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.500
Is to expose what happens when

620
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.400
we turn away from the Lord?

621
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.800
When we walk our own way.

622
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.800
When we stiff arm his leadership in our lives, this is

623
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.400
what happens.

624
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.400
It leads to destruction.

625
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.800
It leads to deception.

626
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.000
It leads to emptiness.

627
00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.500
And I know you see it in your life. Just as much as I sit

628
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.100
in my life every day.

629
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.200
Both inside of us. We see this we feel this right but

630
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.100
we see it all the time around us, don't we?

631
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.200
Where you feel a little bit sad or down?

632
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.300
And so you feel that compulsion to to buy

633
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.200
a new book to satisfy or to go buy some new

634
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.400
shoes or or to go to get a new car.

635
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.300
So you get that new car smell again that you lost after this one's now

636
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.300
two years old right or or you work more hours to

637
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.300
pile up your 401k or

638
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.500
Or you you want more money? So

639
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.600
you're tempted to fudge the numbers on your tax return a little bit or or

640
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.900
to tweak that contract so it has some little claws

641
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.300
in it that they wouldn't find and and you can get more money

642
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:31.800
out of that.

643
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.100
Where you start to long for political power and so you

644
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.900
start berating every opposing candidate online all the time.

645
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.100
Or you start to feel a little bit lonely. And

646
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.300
so you jump online and you look or you

647
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.500
start to send that flirty text to that coworker. You

648
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.500
see these things kind of happen where you're all in an

649
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.500
effort trying to find your joy in something

650
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.500
under the sun.

651
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.600
Where you're finding your life, you're trying to find your life in stuff

652
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.200
or in relationships or in any other

653
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.100
thing and it only ends up worse in the end,

654
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:09.400
right?

655
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.200
It doesn't satisfy. You have to have more you got to find something

656
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.600
new. You got to move on to the neck. You see this never never

657
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.400
fills that Gap.

658
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.800
That's why Jesus said the exact opposite.

659
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.100
In Matthew, 16:24 and

660
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:31.300
25.

661
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.700
He said if anyone would come after me let him deny

662
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.700
himself and take up his cross and follow

663
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:39.900
me.

664
00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.200
For whoever would save his life

665
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.600
meaning if you're finding your life in this if

666
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.400
you save your life, you're gonna lose it.

667
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.600
But whoever loses his life for my sake will actually

668
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.200
find it.

669
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.800
I know it's counterintuitive.

670
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.300
But if we want to truly live then we must lose our

671
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:05.600
lives.

672
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.900
We must lose our desires ourself dying

673
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.300
to ourself to give up control to

674
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.900
him. That's what Jesus said life is found.

675
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.300
if you don't

676
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.400
if you try to find your life in anything in this world and try

677
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.500
to search it out, if you don't give your

678
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.200
life to him Micah 6:16 remember what he did

679
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.200
to Judah says God will make you a desolation.

680
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.500
You shall bear the scorn of my people. He's going

681
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.000
to judge. That's the bad news here. If you

682
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.400
turn away from God's standard. He will judge you for your

683
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.000
sin. If you try to find your life or your love in

684
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.200
life, and anything else God will judge you

685
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.300
for that because it's never going to work.

686
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.800
That's the bad news of this.

687
00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.900
And some of you are running headlong into that pathway.

688
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.600
That's the bad news is judgment is coming.

689
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.200
But that means there's good news too, right?

690
00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.800
See the good news is that Jesus was judged

691
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.800
for you.

692
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.600
Jesus was made a desolation for you.

693
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.900
Jesus bore the scorn for

694
00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.200
you.

695
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.600
Just listen to Isaiah 53 3

696
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.800
through 5 and listen to the language here. He was despised and

697
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.500
rejected by Men A Man of Sorrows acquainted

698
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.700
with grief as one from mid

699
00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.200
hide their faces. He was despised and we

700
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.200
esteemed him not

701
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.800
Surely he is born our griefs carried our

702
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.600
sorrows.

703
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.000
We steamed him stricken Smitten by God.

704
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:51.800
and afflicted

705
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.800
But he was pierced for our transgressions.

706
00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.500
He was crushed for our iniquities upon him was

707
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.500
the chastisement that brought us peace. And

708
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.500
with his wounds we are healed.

709
00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.800
So at First Peter 2:24 says he himself bore

710
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.500
our sins in his body on the tree that we might

711
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.200
die to sin and live to righteousness.

712
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.700
See friend, that's where true life is found.

713
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.600
It's not found in stuff or in reputation or in

714
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.400
power or money or anything else under the

715
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:27.700
sun.

716
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.900
This abundant true life we're talking about this eternal

717
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.700
life. We're talking about is found in Jesus. The one

718
00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.400
who came from Over the son to live

719
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.300
with us and die with us and resurrect for

720
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:40.500
us.

721
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.400
And he's coming back one day to take us home

722
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.000
with him where we go over the son eventually.

723
00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.700
but listen until that day comes

724
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.900
remember he has made us for himself.

725
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.300
And we will not find rest.

726
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.200
Until we find our rest in him.

727
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.200
believer stop searching

728
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.300
You've got it in him already.

729
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.900
Stop running to all of the other things that are are clinging

730
00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.800
to us and and attaching onto

731
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.400
our lives and keeping us as Hebrews says from running

732
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.900
the race that God's called us to run strip it

733
00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.300
off get rid of it and stop trusting it

734
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.900
because you already have rest in Jesus.

735
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.300
rest in his presence

736
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.200
Remember who he is? Remember what he's done and rest in

737
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:39.400
that?

738
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.000
But here's how we're going to get there today.

739
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.000
We wanted to provide a time of Silent reflection.

740
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:51.500
over

741
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.400
over where we stand with that

742
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:56.400
because

743
00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.000
in Light of Christ in light of this message from Micah

744
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.200
nine.

745
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.200
We need to reflect.

746
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.700
Where we feel this emptiness in

747
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:09.300
our souls.

748
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.000
Where do you see deception in your own heart?

749
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.300
Is the Lord Awakening you to any Idols that you're

750
00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.300
chasing?

751
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.300
And so we want to give some space for that.

752
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.400
We run away from quiet. We need to rest in that for

753
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.500
a second sit in that quiet just to allow the Lord to to Really

754
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.300
confront us.

755
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.600
And so you're going to feel some emptiness of where you've sought this

756
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.300
and it hasn't fulfilled. You you're gonna feel some deception of

757
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.300
where you've maybe lied here or deceived here. You're gonna see some

758
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.400
Idols. That's what we're praying for you and you should pray for yourself that God

759
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.100
would expose that in your heart. And so as you feel that

760
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.200
as you recognize where you have not hungered after

761
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.100
the Lord You've hungry after all these other things.

762
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.200
Here can be your prayer.

763
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.500
Psalm 42

764
00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.700
As a deer pants for flowing streams.

765
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.200
So pants my soul for you o God.

766
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.800
my soul thirsts for God

767
00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.400
for the Living God

768
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.800
Maybe you've never felt that hunger before.

769
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.600
or maybe you have

770
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.200
covered it with all of this other stuff and you know, it's back there, but you've

771
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.300
never just let it actually be there.

772
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.000
to thirst and hunger for God

773
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.300
Just in this quiet moment.

774
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.900
Run to that father who loves you already.

775
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.900
And let him strip away all that other stuff.

776
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.300
And to feel that hunger that's only found satisfaction in

777
00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:57.700
him.
