1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.000
Right. All right,

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.300
good evening. Glad you're here.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.400
We're gonna go ahead and get started. We are in week

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400
11 of a 12-week course and so we'll be

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.100
wrapping things up in the next couple of nights next

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.200
this one this Wednesday and next Wednesday and

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.300
then we'll shut down for the holidays. I'm not quite

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.100
sure what it's gonna look like in the spring yet. But this

9
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.700
won't be the last time we do this course it might

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.400
be the last time we do it in 12 weeks and we

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.900
may be able to do it in a shorter amount of time. But but this

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.200
was a good good first start a proud of you guys for being

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.800
here everyone of you. I've got some exciting

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
news for you. But before we do it, let's kind of review. This

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.700
is the pathway and who would

16
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.900
like to get up here and talk about the pathway. I'm

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.500
not gonna make you do that. So what's your

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.900
job at each step in this pathway? Well at

19
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.700
worship Services if you meet somebody who

20
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.400
doesn't have

21
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.100
CG will you invite them say I'll help

22
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.500
you find one come with me out to the information desk because we're

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.100
trying to work people in this direction and CG

24
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.100
is where they get involved relationally. Did you

25
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.600
know this is such great news that the

26
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600
Sunday night CG's and some of the 11. I'm in

27
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.700
the 1030 CG's they'll meet for

28
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.400
their Bible study discussion, but then they'll break

29
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.500
up into micro groups afterwards because they have more time

30
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.200
and so they they do the whole

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.500
thing in the in the context of their CG and what

32
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.600
we're learning is is this is the sweet spot right here. This is

33
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.500
where we can do identify that relational

34
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.300
environment with an intentional leader

35
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
and a relational environment and a reproducible process. And

36
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.400
what we have is a disciple making movement in

37
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.300
our hands and what is a disciple one who's

38
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.700
following Jesus being changed by Jesus and is committed

39
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.300
to the mission of Jesus and that's disciple making

40
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.900
so I want you to have these memorized and

41
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.100
Part of your who you are again. We've we've done

42
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.200
this before. I'm trying to see if the Yahoo mocks. My

43
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.200
handwriting is here because I may have her come up here and write this

44
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.900
down. Okay, I see you back there. But so one

45
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.300
of the one of the great things

46
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.200
about the large group time, the worship service is that

47
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.700
it's very well-timed. It's very precise. Our

48
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.300
speaker has a PHD in discipleship. Well,

49
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.200
it might be more of a demon. I'm not 100% sure.

50
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.800
But anyway, so the music is playing and rehearsed

51
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.600
everything looks great and you can literally come

52
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.200
anonymously sit in the dark and not

53
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.900
have to speak to anybody.

54
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.300
now

55
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.300
that's the strength if you don't have anything to say, but that's not how

56
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.200
disciples are made. So what we've discovered is that

57
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.600
as we climb this opportunity for a more

58
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.500
opportunity than we can find genuine intimacy.

59
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.800
That means we know and are known.

60
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.600
As intimacy I was somebody say I can't ride intimacy and

61
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.200
why we do that we do that through transparency. We're going

62
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200
to be talking about that.

63
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.200
transparency and somebody want to give me a

64
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.600
Now, I'm just kidding. I'm not mad. I

65
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.300
can Spell transparency but

66
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.400
not while I'm talking at the same time.

67
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.500
So who let's let's do this. Give me one or

68
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.500
two Word answers. What is the definition of transparency anyone?

69
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.400
openness

70
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.200
authentic

71
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.900
vulnerable

72
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.700
So yeah, do you see that? That was like a snowball did

73
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.800
you see what was happening there? What we're trying to do ultimately is

74
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.400
have and go real slow. Stop talking for

75
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.300
a second account.

76
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.000
A Billet team. Okay. Thank

77
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.400
you very much. So we really

78
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.400
want accountability because it is in the The

79
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.300
Crucible of accountability where we've been

80
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.200
honest enough to say this is a weakness that I

81
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.400
struggle with or this is a sin that I am tempted

82
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.800
with it is within that Crucible then now we

83
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.900
are

84
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.000
we're risking trusting one another with this

85
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.300
transparent trust to hold me

86
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.500
accountable. See how's that fight going and with

87
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.500
some accountability you're gonna discover that the holy

88
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.800
spirit is able to to help you stand stronger

89
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.100
than you would alone. All right.

90
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.400
So let's talk about the Holy Spirit know the holy spirit's role.

91
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.400
The Holy Spirit has a number. We're

92
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.300
not going to be able to cover the Holy Spirit tonight in five minutes,

93
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.500
but the Holy Spirit does so much we've talked

94
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.200
about how the holy spirit is a teacher. So I'm gonna take

95
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.500
that off your plate. You don't have to be a teacher to be a disciple

96
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.500
maker. All you need to do is understand the holy spirit that

97
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.600
he draws people. What does he do?

98
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.800
here

99
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.500
he gives New Life In Christ. He the

100
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.000
Holy Spirit also draws us into a relationship with Christ and

101
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.500
the Holy Spirit also lives in every follower

102
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.300
of Jesus. So when a disciple group

103
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.600
meets together when a micro group meets together the holy spirit.

104
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600
Is there among them.

105
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.500
And he guides us into truth. He

106
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.100
keeps us in Fellowship. He convicts us

107
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.400
of sin. And he leads us in guides Us in the direction

108
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.000
that we ought to go. What is our role and that's not

109
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.900
as important as the holy spirit's role but in

110
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.000
the Providence of God, he has given us the

111
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.700
opportunity an honor and privilege of

112
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.200
Keeping in step with the spirit or walking with

113
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.800
the spirit. So there's really only one thing we have to do. My role

114
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.200
is to live under the control of the

115
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.100
Holy Spirit. Hopefully you've read Galatians 5:16 says

116
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.500
but I say walk by the

117
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.400
spirit and you'll not gratify the desires of

118
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.200
the flesh. So let's talk really quickly about the

119
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.700
Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit has been commissioned by

120
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.700
God to to be

121
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.100
The Power Within every individual

122
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.400
believer. What did the disciples say?

123
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.100
And then what did Jesus say did Jesus is I'm going

124
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.500
to prepare a place for you. And this is if I go, I

125
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.500
will send a paraclete. That's the Greek word

126
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.800
for comfort her or Advocate and

127
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.200
he will dwell within you and you'll do

128
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.000
greater things that I've ever done and the paraclete

129
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.800
the actual interpretation of

130
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.600
that Greek word paraclete is one who comes alongside.

131
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.200
And isn't it great to think that God himself in

132
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.300
the presence of the holy spirit will come alongside us as

133
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.700
we are working at being disciples and making disciples

134
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.200
and empowering us and equipping us

135
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.600
and motivating us. And so I feel as

136
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.200
if I can okay. We've been together 11 weeks and

137
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.800
so we're really close now, aren't we?

138
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.400
Yeah, thank you. One of you.

139
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.200
I think that if we've discovered that this is

140
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.200
the commission of God to make disciples and if we

141
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.600
have been committed enough to meet together not just under

142
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.400
instruction, but also in micro group.

143
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.600
Test pilots test tubes if you will, we've actually

144
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.300
experienced what it means to be in a micro group. And now

145
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.400
in the next two weeks is

146
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.700
I'm going to be giving you the total

147
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.300
responsibility of deciding. Okay.

148
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.300
I'm either going to be in a micro group or I'm gonna lead a

149
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.700
micro group.

150
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.400
And it's going to be on you and you know, what you're going to do you're gonna have to decide is

151
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.100
the holy spirit going to lead me to do

152
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.400
this or am I going to decide that's not

153
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.600
for me.

154
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.200
And you can do that. But but here's here's something about

155
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.300
the holy spirit that makes him unique. Okay, the holy spirit

156
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.200
is promised to indwell and to fill

157
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.100
where I'm from in Tulsa filled with

158
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.300
the holy spirit means something different. All right. I'm not

159
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.200
talking about some sort of ecstatic experience or some

160
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.700
sort of a

161
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.000
I don't know emotional issue. But when I talk about

162
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.800
being filled with the spirit, I'm talking about the Holy Spirit and dwelling

163
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.800
me to a place where I sense is presence and

164
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.200
his power. That's the kingdom of God for me is

165
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.400
the presence and power of God through the presence of the Holy Spirit

166
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.700
his Reign his rule his will

167
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.800
his way are all outside my grasp

168
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.100
but through his presence and power and the Holy

169
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.800
Spirit. Now, I have the opportunity to participate in his

170
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.800
will and his way and his Rule and

171
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.500
his Reign and that's what makes the Christian life.

172
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.800
So meaningful. Okay, I'm

173
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.500
gonna just tell you that in the presence and

174
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.300
power of the Holy Spirit when I'm filled with the spirit and

175
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.200
walking in the spirit as the scripture challenges me to

176
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.100
do so, I can't imagine doing anything any else

177
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.000
any other way.

178
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.700
However, the Holy Spirit can also be grieved.

179
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.800
scripture talks about how

180
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.700
with our repeated Disobedience that we

181
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.600
can grieve the Holy Spirit and then pretend

182
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.600
to live the Christian Life in his power without his

183
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:03.900
power.

184
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.500
I'm not going to do this by rays of hands. Okay, and

185
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.200
so, please don't raise your hand right. Now. How many

186
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.100
of you have done that and sometimes the Christian Life can be

187
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.800
actually quite

188
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.100
quite difficult in your own power

189
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.400
And so what happens is you'll step away because it is difficult

190
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.400
and it feels good because now you've grieved the

191
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.200
holy spirit in the further that you can get away from him. Then the more

192
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.500
you feel like I don't have to feel that conviction of

193
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.400
the Holy Spirit. What I would suggest to you is instead

194
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.800
of grieving the Holy Spirit. Then you the gospel

195
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.100
response is to repent of the

196
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.300
decision of the of the things that you've done selfish things disobedient

197
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.300
things evil fleshly things.

198
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.500
You're you repent of those things and then

199
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.500
you you ask for forgiveness and then by

200
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.000
faith you step back into the presence of the

201
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.700
power of the Holy Spirit and You Begin since his

202
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.200
filling in his leading in his guiding

203
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.200
I can take you back to the

204
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.200
Frontage Road in Frisco, Oklahoma where the

205
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.400
Holy Spirit just

206
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.500
just kind of came out of my

207
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.800
chest right after just a disciple moment.

208
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.200
I I could not believe this is gonna

209
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.300
happen to you and I

210
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.300
want you to be able to tell me this story. All right,

211
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.500
when it happens to you. I want you to be able to articulate how

212
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.600
and why it happened, but you don't

213
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.400
plan it.

214
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.600
You don't structure it. There's

215
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.100
no three steps to it, but there will

216
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.500
be a moment where the holy spirit makes himself evident in

217
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.500
the process of transformation. And when you see a

218
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.500
person go from either death to life or from

219
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.900
Infant Christianity to young adult

220
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.300
Christianity and all sudden. It's not about him so

221
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.400
much. It's about God God's plan for him

222
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.700
or her and you just see I

223
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.100
mean, hopefully you're gonna

224
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.700
have an opportunity to answer that question tonight. Have you ever been

225
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.000
influenced by the Holy Spirit? If you ever experience

226
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.000
the power of the Holy Spirit Well, I was

227
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.700
like I said, I was in this IHOP. I was with my micro group a

228
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.300
guy the Holy

229
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.000
Spirit was just all over him and he was

230
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.400
Deeply convicted by about some of the decisions and behaviors

231
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.200
that he'd made and he says I want you guys to pray for me because

232
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.200
you know, everybody in the

233
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.000
room knows what the answer is you need to repent you need to you know,

234
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.400
get your life right and you get back and step with the spirit everybody with the

235
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.000
answer was but at that moment when one disciple

236
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.400
turned to the other I didn't have anything to say about it and

237
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.300
he said and it was like the spirit was speaking through him. I want

238
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.500
you to know I've been praying for you every day since I heard this was a struggle

239
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:51.700
for you.

240
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.600
And I mean it was just like guys I

241
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.200
want to know I'm in a Southern Baptist nine months before I was

242
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.200
born. Okay, when I raised my hands I raised him about this

243
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.600
high and I feel pretty uncomfortable about it actually so I am not, you

244
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.200
know flaming charismatic, but I'm

245
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.400
just telling you it was as if the Shekinah Glory of

246
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.200
God fell on that I hop at that moment and we

247
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.800
were just like in holy

248
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.600
Ah of what God was doing and I

249
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.200
want that experience for you. I want

250
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.000
you to begin to experience the transformative power of the

251
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.700
holy spirit in your micro group so that you can say to yourself. I can't

252
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.200
imagine doing anything else with my life for the

253
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:32.800
rest of my life.

254
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.300
I think that micro group disciple making

255
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.400
is not just transformational. I believe it's generational.

256
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.200
I believe that well, I heard a story this week that

257
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.300
I can't tell because I don't have permission to but it had

258
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.800
happened in this room.

259
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.400
Or a micro group did something that was profoundly transformative

260
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.800
and and

261
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.300
I heard it in appraiser report and the

262
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:57.600
staff meeting.

263
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.500
And I was just thinking to myself that's exactly what we're wanting

264
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.800
to see happen. So anyway, my role

265
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.300
is just to live under the control of the Holy Spirit

266
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.300
Breath by breath Moment by moment word by

267
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.300
word day by day of week by week and know the goal.

268
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.000
The goal is transformation. Here's three necessary

269
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.300
ingredients. These are the things that need

270
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.200
to happen in your micro group. And in order for you to get

271
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.700
to have transformation and one is this transparent trust

272
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.200
as we were discussing.

273
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.400
You have to have transparent trust

274
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.500
and here's three things that will help you get there by affirming one

275
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.600
another through encouragement.

276
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.600
Man, I'm glad you're here. I was thought I was going to be here breakfast by

277
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.800
myself. I'm so glad you're here.

278
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.100
And hey, would you lead our prayer next week? And you know,

279
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.300
and I knew I could count on you. But but again

280
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.600
encouragement is is a powerful motivator and

281
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.100
we all need it also by walking with

282
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.400
one another through difficult circumstances. If your

283
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.100
micro group is together for at least a year. I can guarantee you at least

284
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.200
everybody in that room in that group is going to go

285
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.600
through a difficult circumstance.

286
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.800
Could be a health issue. It could be a family issue relational issue

287
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.200
could be a financial issue. I don't know but it's going

288
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.800
to be difficult. And if you walk with one another through those difficult circumstances

289
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.200
that transparent trust will continue to

290
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.300
build I have lots of stories to tell you about that, but we

291
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.600
need to move on and here's probably the most difficult one.

292
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.000
And as an intentional leader, you're going to have to lead out in this. Okay, and

293
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:30.300
that's the admission of sins and weaknesses. Okay, Bible

294
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.300
says if we confess our

295
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.400
sins one to another then we

296
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.400
will be healed and I'm not saying that you need to do that

297
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.100
in a CG. All right guys, I haven't been

298
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.700
here in a few weeks, but I've got some sins I need to you know see Geezer

299
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.100
for one thing. But when you're with a micro group of people

300
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.400
that you know, you can trust you say I need you guys to hold me

301
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.100
accountable something I really struggle with this.

302
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.300
And when you that's that vulnerability that's that

303
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.300
transparency and if you can admit that I

304
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.100
struggle with this and I need your accountability with this you're going to

305
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.400
be surprised through their prayer and through a mutuality of hey,

306
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.600
we're in this together. Nobody's perfect. And

307
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.900
we're going to help each other. Then you're gonna begin to see this transparent

308
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.400
trust and that is again a necessary

309
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.300
ingredient for a transformation number true. The

310
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.000
truth of God's word.

311
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.300
Okay, holy spirit is

312
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.500
a teacher God's word is God in in his

313
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.500
specific Revelation and we

314
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.700
have second Timothy 3:16 and 17 all scriptures

315
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.300
given by inspiration of God as profitable for correction reproof.

316
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.700
I mean instruction correction reproof

317
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.500
and instruction and righteousness at the man of God, maybe perfect and

318
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.300
thoroughly furnished and all good works. That's the KJV version.

319
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.700
Sorry. I'll get back to the ESV. So what

320
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.600
can God do it's profitable

321
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.500
for teaching the holy spirit is the teacher for

322
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.600
reproof. You're going to be a learning and identifying things

323
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.200
that need to change about your life and about the lives of

324
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.000
those in your group. And what you need to do is instead of

325
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.600
what you have been doing and then training in righteousness.

326
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.200
And why so that we can be complete and equipped for

327
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.800
every good work? So again, not just

328
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.200
that transparent trust, but the truth of

329
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.800
God's word though. That's the one two punch.

330
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.800
And then lastly a mutual accountability. This is

331
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.400
not the leader holding the members

332
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.200
accountable. This is mutual accountability.

333
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.700
And this is

334
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.800
perhaps as an intention leader one

335
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.400
of your greatest.

336
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:32.800
strengths

337
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.300
Is to say hey guys, let's let's pray for

338
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.700
one another. I want to find out how can we pray for one another? Let

339
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.900
me tell you how you can pray for me.

340
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.200
Okay instead of saying how can we

341
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.800
pray for one another?

342
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.100
And then just waiting you model that

343
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.100
behavior how let me tell you how you can pray for me.

344
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.400
And what I would probably say

345
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.400
is you guys know my mom's 87 she's got dementia. She's

346
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.300
probably gonna call here in a minute. It's gonna pop up right here in the whole group's gonna

347
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:04.400
see it.

348
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.400
But she'll call me last night. She called

349
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:08.900
me nine times.

350
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.600
And doesn't remember that she's called me.

351
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.500
And and I'm not asking you for prayer for her because that's that's

352
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.200
what God has given to her. I'm gonna ask

353
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.100
you to pray for me so that I'll I'll respond in Grace.

354
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.200
You know.

355
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.500
And so what did I just do I just shared a real

356
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.100
difficult circumstance.

357
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.700
And and I was honest and transparent enough to say sometimes

358
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.000
I don't even want to answer the phone.

359
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.600
You know sometimes when I answer the phone, I'm not always present.

360
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.800
You know and so when as a as an intention leader, I'll

361
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.200
model that kind of mutual accountability

362
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.600
says anybody else struggling with something then

363
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.000
they're going to be more inclined to say. Yeah. I got a struggle here,

364
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.200
too.

365
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.800
And so you see these are the things that the necessary ingredients is

366
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.500
transparent trust. The truth of God's word and

367
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.200
mutable Mutual accountability. Now, here's

368
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.200
some exciting news and I need everybody here

369
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.200
to understand what I'm about to tell you. Okay, we have

370
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.600
just launched today another page on

371
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.200
the Henderson Hills Baptist Church website. If you go

372
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.100
to hhbc.com forward slash disciple.

373
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.100
Then it will pull up three buttons and one

374
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.400
is as I want to be discipled. Another button

375
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.000
is I want to make disciples and another button is

376
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.800
Micro group updates now. I don't

377
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.000
know if this is going to work. Okay. So you guys forgive me

378
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.600
if it doesn't laugh at me if you want to but up

379
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.900
look at here, okay.

380
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.200
Let's see if I can go back and what that'll do.

381
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.100
Okay, there it is. Right there. There's your it's gonna

382
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.500
get better it launched today. It'll have a description of what discipleship is

383
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.700
but there's your three buttons. I want

384
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.200
to be discipled. I want to make disciples and micro

385
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.200
group Updates. This is gonna

386
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.200
be an opportunity from this point until God calls me

387
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.700
home or he returns to take us all this

388
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.600
is going to be where we meet together as a disciple

389
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.600
making movement and on micro group

390
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.100
update you just click it and it'll take it to a form

391
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.200
on our church website. Of course, you'll feel

392
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.700
that out.

393
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.500
And if you're in the system, it'll populate itself

394
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.200
doesn't look like I'm in the system. I don't know how that might

395
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:24.900
work. But

396
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.400
let me see HH. No, that's not it. What is my

397
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.400
email? I say, oh he

398
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.800
at hhbc.com

399
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.000
and it's gonna make me do my football mobile phone 918

400
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.400
And no one text me because that'll come up on my iPad. Okay?

401
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.500
If everybody does it won't that be hilarious?

402
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.700
Not much actually.

403
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.300
That's not it.

404
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.700
Let's just keep going to a four six seven

405
00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.600
zero zero.

406
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.400
Oh, please don't make me put the whole thing in all right.

407
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.900
So let's look at this.

408
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.800
Are you a micro group leader or participant?

409
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.100
Right. Now I know that we'll have some who want to lead and some who just want to

410
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.300
participate. All right, what are the names of the members of

411
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.000
your current macro group and you can type those in there? Okay at

412
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.700
this is just

413
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.400
For this group. All right is your

414
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.600
current micro group going to continue to meet I did

415
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.600
not ask you to do that. But some of you have decided

416
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.600
against my better judgment now,

417
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.000
I'm just kidding. I really don't care if if you want to

418
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.700
continue to meet I think that's fine.

419
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.200
But I would love to know it. Okay, so you'll click yes or no,

420
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.200
whether we're going to continue to meet what time and day you're gonna

421
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.400
meet and then the look of these last two and these are gonna be my favorites. Okay

422
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.500
story briefly explain how

423
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.900
God is at work transforming lives in your micro group. These stories

424
00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.300
are being collected industry to encourage one

425
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.300
another and Inspire new disciple makers.

426
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.900
When God does something like what we just described a

427
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.600
transformative Transcendent experience where

428
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.300
the power and the presence the Holy Spirit was palpable tell me

429
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.600
about it.

430
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.800
And then we'll share that with one another in ways. Discreetly

431
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.300
if you ask but in ways to see that listen

432
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.400
disciple making changes lives and changing lives

433
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.200
as the goal when transformation occurs in

434
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.300
the glory of God is is applauded in

435
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.300
renowned and and people want to get involved in that right and

436
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.600
then this last one notes briefly explain

437
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.200
how this option community staff can assist you and encourage

438
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.300
you to stop a maker and any question is not out

439
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.000
of balance. If you have a question, he's like does anybody

440
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.200
pay attention to these notes? You know, I don't care what the question

441
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:48.400
is.

442
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.900
but but that will get to me and I will personally

443
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.700
call you and help you through whatever you're

444
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.400
needing to know about disciple making all right,

445
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.100
and then you submit that and it's not going to

446
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.000
let you tell you put all your

447
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.000
Red red line see that there. You got to

448
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.900
put all that in. So anyway, but here's the

449
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.000
deal.

450
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.200
I would love for you to do this without me baking you.

451
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.000
Okay, but I will beg you.

452
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.500
All right, and so imagine if

453
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:19.900
you will.

454
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.900
An avalanche of emails coming on a weekly basis.

455
00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.300
It's possible. You don't want that.

456
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.400
I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna do that. But anyway, I really this is this is

457
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.500
gonna help so much because I think

458
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.000
the intentional leader is responsible for collecting the persons

459
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.400
in this micro group, but there will be people happen to

460
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.700
me Sunday morning a guy comes up to me because man, I want to be discipled where

461
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:43.900
I go.

462
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.000
And and I so I had to write his name down, you know

463
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.300
like it was 1974 and anyway, and

464
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.200
then I had to remember where I put it and that kind of thing. This is gonna help us.

465
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.000
All right. So if you have

466
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.300
any questions about that ask me a privately later, but I want us

467
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.200
to pray together and I want us to get into our micro groups. One of

468
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.500
the questions is how did the Holy Spirit impact you or influence

469
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.200
you I hope that you are able to share stories about

470
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.400
God's involvement in your life, and maybe

471
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.200
it's recently maybe it was when you were younger, but there's there's

472
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.200
nothing more powerful than

473
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.200
when we share legitimately.

474
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.600
Transcendent transforming stories of how God's

475
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.300
power has made us into his likeness and it's why I

476
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.500
do what I do and that's why I do it until Till the

477
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.200
End Amen. Let's pray.

478
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.500
Father thank you for these people for their

479
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.200
willingness to come Lord. I Thank you that.

480
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.500
That you have promised that if we

481
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.600
ask anything according to your will you hear us? And so we

482
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.200
know father that it is your will that we become life-changing

483
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.300
disciple makers we're

484
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.200
transformation occurs. And your glory is Renown and so

485
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.300
Lord. That's our prayer. And if it starts tonight, we

486
00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.500
would pray that that we would recognize

487
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.700
that that's exactly what's happening because we prayed and you're

488
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.500
answering our prayers Lord in these coming weeks. We'll

489
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.000
have to make decisions as far as when we're gonna

490
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.300
meet and where we're going to meet and who is going to be in our group and I pray Lord

491
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.700
that the spirit of God will not let us rest until

492
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.200
we have come to terms of the fact that you have called us

493
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.500
to be disciple makers.

494
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.200
And this is because Jesus did what he did for us and it is

495
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.400
in his name. We pray. Amen. Amen. Let's meet

496
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:27.500
together.
