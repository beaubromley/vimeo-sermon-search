00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.500
Good evening.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.500
I'm gonna say that one more time. This is a crowd participation

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.900
question.

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.600
Good evening.

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.300
Thank you. And you guys pick up so quickly. It's very encouraging

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.700
for a speaker. My name

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.200
is Phil Sally. I'm the pastor of discipleship and

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.400
community and this is our first night of a

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.600
string of about 13 equipping nights.

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.800
This will be a four week exercise with

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.300
Dr. Matthew Emerson Al introduce him

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.800
in just a minute. But if you are a guest here at

13
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.300
Henderson Hills Baptist Church, we want

14
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.300
to say welcome and we don't believe that it's an accident

15
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.200
that you're here. We've prayed that you would come and

16
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.900
so tonight you're an answer to our prayers and we have a QR code

17
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.400
and if you don't know what that means.

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.300
Just gonna have to come talk to me later. Okay, but if

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.200
you'll just take a picture of that it'll take it to a website. You can fill out a

20
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.200
card. We'd love to have a record of your visit to just let you know. Thank you for coming. What

21
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.000
is equipping. Well,

22
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.200
there are many verses in Scripture that

23
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.300
talk about how we are to equip one another that's

24
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.400
our vision to equip one another to love Jesus and to

25
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.400
live sin. And so Dr. Emerson from Oklahoma

26
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.800
Baptist University has a co-authored

27
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.300
more than 20 books and is

28
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300
responsible for one that that stuck out to me called

29
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.500
the story of scripture.

30
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.500
And so if you think about it, the Bible isn't a collection

31
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.000
of laws or lessons. It's it's

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.100
not just lists of

33
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.700
genealogies. It's a collection of stories stories about

34
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600
people and events and families and Nations and

35
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.500
kingdoms and I believe that

36
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.200
in these four weeks that Dr. Emerson is going

37
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.100
to help us fall even deeper in love with God's story and I

38
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.500
got this off of his book flap. Okay. So

39
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.800
this isn't mine in Academia, you

40
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.600
have to cite your sources. And so I got this off his book. It's one

41
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.300
big written by one author the holy spirit

42
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.400
with one subject Jesus Christ. And so

43
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.400
we're thrilled to have him here. I'm gonna lead us

44
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.100
in a prayer and then when I'm done praying, I'm gonna say

45
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.400
well welcome Dr. Matthew Emerson and you guys are gonna spontaneously bust

46
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.600
loose with this abrarious Applause.

47
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.300
Welcome him to our church. All right, let's pray

48
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.600
together father. Thank you so much for your word and

49
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.200
Lord we know.

50
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.900
That it sharpens us that it equips us that it rebukes and

51
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.200
corrects us and instructs Us in

52
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.300
righteousness. And so Lord. Let us become not just

53
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.600
familiar with the word, but obedient with your word and

54
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.400
we thank you Lord for men who have studied and who have

55
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.700
grasp insights that they're willing to share and we

56
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.100
thank you for Dr. Emerson and Jesus and we pray amen. You

57
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.800
guys get ready to get your hands. Ready. Welcome Dr. Matthew

58
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.400
Emerson.

59
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.300
Thank you, Phil. I was trying to preempt the

60
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.300
uproaria supplies by getting on stage first, but

61
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.800
Didn't succeed in thwarting your efforts. Well, good evening.

62
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.400
I'm very grateful to be here. Thank you Phil for inviting

63
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.700
me. It's my understanding that I'm your the

64
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.000
first guest in this series. Is that right? So and you've

65
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.500
been here for six months, so I'm not gonna pin my

66
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.200
jaw or your job on me, but if I don't do well

67
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.900
don't blame it on Phil. So what I

68
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.400
want to do,

69
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.600
in the next four weeks

70
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.100
is really just walk through the Bible and we're

71
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.000
gonna start in Genesis 1:1 and we're going to

72
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.900
make it all the way to revelation 22 by the end of it. And the

73
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.400
reason why

74
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.100
this is important to me and why I wrote a

75
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.000
book about it and why I like to teach on it is because

76
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.300
I grew up in church.

77
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.100
I grew up in hearing in Sunday school

78
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.800
the different stories that are in the Bible. Mostly the big

79
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.100
ones that we know like The Exodus Noah

80
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.100
and the Ark, you know, the the

81
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.900
stories of Jesus's Miracles his teachings

82
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.200
some of the stories of the book of Acts. I

83
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.000
grew up hearing these stories and I grew up

84
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.000
hearing the gospel.

85
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.200
I grew up hearing that Jesus died for my sins. And if I trusted him

86
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.900
I would be saved.

87
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200
But I didn't really grow up.

88
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.300
Being taught how the Bible fits together as one book.

89
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.500
and

90
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.200
You know, that's not to blame the church that I grew up in or

91
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.000
anything like that, but it is to say later on in my walk with

92
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.400
the Lord.

93
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.800
It became difficult for me to read

94
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.200
my Bible.

95
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.600
It became difficult for me to open my bible to

96
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.000
a particular book and start reading and say wow. I'm

97
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.200
really getting something from this story about

98
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.600
a person. I've never heard of who I

99
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.500
can't relate to anybody else in the Bible.

100
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.700
It just sounds like

101
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.300
The distant past Jesus has already come why

102
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.000
don't I need to know this stuff?

103
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.700
I would open my bible to you know.

104
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.500
A passage out of the middle of Second Kings and

105
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.000
just go.

106
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.500
Okay, didn't even touch numbers

107
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.400
or Leviticus?

108
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.300
The point of books like Song of Songs

109
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.400
alluded me that's from married people.

110
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.500
You know and it was that sort of approach to understanding

111
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.200
and reading the Bible.

112
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.300
and when I was in school

113
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.700
Thankfully I had some professors who taught me

114
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.000
that the Bible isn't just a collection

115
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.700
of 66 different books.

116
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.400
That have really not a whole lot to do with each other other than

117
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.900
maybe some of the stories carry over and ultimately this

118
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.900
whole book is centered on

119
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.700
Jesus, but that these 66 books

120
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.400
actually comprise one book.

121
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.700
That the 66 books from Genesis to Revelation aren't just

122
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.400
kind of thrown together, but that they fit

123
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.500
together like a puzzle.

124
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.100
And just like when you put a puzzle together correctly where

125
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.700
all the pieces match and they're putting the right place. It

126
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.100
makes this whole picture.

127
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.500
The same thing is true of the books of the Bible and the different stories

128
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.100
in those books. Then when you put them together when you see how

129
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.900
they fit together.

130
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.600
What you see is a picture.

131
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.100
in the pictures of Jesus

132
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.900
and so what I want to do over the next four weeks is just walk you

133
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.200
through the Bible.

134
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.100
We're not going to read every verse in the

135
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.700
Bible. So hopefully that lessens the stress level a

136
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.800
little bit. I want to walk you through the whole Bible want

137
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.500
to see how this whole book. This.

138
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.500
One book is a book about one person. Jesus

139
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.100
written by one author the Holy Spirit.

140
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.800
And in doing that I hope that it'll help honestly. I

141
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.300
hope it'll just help your devotional life.

142
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.900
I hope it'll help you want to read the Bible.

143
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.400
I hope it will help you overcome some of the obstacles you

144
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.200
found in trying to read your Bible at different parts of

145
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.500
the Bible.

146
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.600
and

147
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.500
I want you to see how seeing the Bible as

148
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.300
one book and hearing all these different ways

149
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.400
the Bible fits together. I want you to see how that impacts your own

150
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.800
daily life.

151
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.200
God has made the world for a purpose.

152
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.200
He's made you for a purpose.

153
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.100
Sin has affected our ability to relate to God

154
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.100
into one another but he has sent his son Jesus.

155
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.700
To die for our sins and to redeem what Adam lost.

156
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.300
And that matters for your daily life.

157
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.100
That matters how you live and work and relate to each other how

158
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.400
you interact with your family how you talk to

159
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.800
your friends?

160
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.200
So I want you to see not just how the Bible is one

161
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.400
book by how that one book is transformative for your life. Okay, so

162
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.400
we're going to start in the very beginning. So if you have a Bible

163
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.900
Let's look at Genesis 1.

164
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.100
I am gonna read quite a bit of Genesis 1

165
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.200
and to be honest with you. I'm not

166
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.300
sure we're gonna make it out of Genesis 3 tonight. Okay, so just

167
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:08.900
be prepared.

168
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.400
To stay in the beginning of Genesis. We might we'll see.

169
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.900
It depends. It depends on how many weird faces

170
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.400
Aaron Miller makes at me during this entire thing.

171
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.100
So

172
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.800
Genesis 1 and on the slides

173
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.100
on the screen. These are really just for you to be

174
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.300
able to follow along but as

175
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.500
we begin I'm gonna work through

176
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.900
the Bible in four big plot points. So if

177
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.100
you think about a story there are different kinds

178
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.200
of plot points or points along the

179
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.800
way we're significant things happen. You can group the

180
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.100
story in a different parts. You can think about

181
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.400
it in terms of chapters.

182
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.400
The Bible has four of those four big plot points

183
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.200
for big chapters for big categories. However,

184
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.700
you want to say that.

185
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.200
And the first one of those is creation.

186
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.000
In creation lasts for the part of

187
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.800
the Bible that deals specifically with creation lasts two

188
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.400
chapters. Of course, there are other chapters in the Bible that address creation

189
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.500
but the Bible telling us about what happened and what

190
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.100
creation is for just last for two chapters the first

191
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.200
two chapters of Genesis.

192
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.600
And on the screen what you're going to see is a summary of

193
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.300
what we're about to walk through. So you're welcome to

194
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.800
write those down. But as I tell my students.

195
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.900
In class the point really isn't the PowerPoint slide.

196
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.500
The point is for you to have a kind of outline for

197
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.800
how we're going to walk through these two chapters.

198
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.100
Okay. So as we as we look

199
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.100
at Genesis 1, let's just read together and I'll read it. You don't have to

200
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.300
read it out loud with me, but we'll read together. Let's start in

201
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.900
verse 1 and I'm just going to read and point out some things as we read.

202
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.400
So Genesis 1 verse 1 in the beginning God created the

203
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.300
heavens and the Earth.

204
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.200
The Earth was without form and void and darkness was over

205
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.300
the face of the deep and the spirit of God was hovering over

206
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.400
the face of the waters.

207
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.400
And God said let there be light and there

208
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:10.800
was light.

209
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.300
And God saw that the light was good and God

210
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.200
separated the light from the darkness.

211
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.000
God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and there

212
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.100
was evening and there was mourning the first

213
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.800
day now is I'm going to keep reading but as we read what I want you to do is

214
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.500
pay attention to the things that are repeated.

215
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.600
Okay, verse 6 and God said let there

216
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.000
be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it

217
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.100
separate the waters from the waters and God made the

218
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.600
expanse and separated from the waters that were under the expanse from

219
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600
the waters that were above the expanse and it was so

220
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.000
and God called the expanse heaven and there was

221
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.200
evening and there was morning the second day. You should

222
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.300
already hear some repetition here.

223
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.400
Verse 9 and God said let the waters under the heavens be

224
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.100
gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear and it

225
00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.400
was so.

226
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.500
God called the dry land Earth and the

227
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.500
waters that were gathered together. He called seas and God saw

228
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.400
that it was good. And God said let the Earth Sprout

229
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.400
vegetation plants yielding seed and fruit

230
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.400
trees it bearing fruit. And which is their seed each according to

231
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.000
its kind on the earth, and it was so

232
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.700
The Earth brought forth vegetation plants yielding

233
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.100
seed according to their own kinds and trees bearing fruit

234
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.900
in which is their seed each according to its own kind and

235
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.200
God saw that it was good.

236
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.300
And there was evening and there was morning.

237
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.600
The third day, let's just pause right there.

238
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.300
You're welcome to say these out loud or Sam

239
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.400
in your head. Whatever you want. But what are some what

240
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.000
are some repeated words and phrases?

241
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.900
That you heard there in those first three days.

242
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.400
anybody bold enough to say something out loud and God said

243
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.700
Okay, what else?

244
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.300
Separation. Yep, there are things being separated from

245
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:57.600
each other.

246
00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.400
It was good.

247
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.200
God saw that it was good, right he said it

248
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.400
and it happened and then he saw that it was good.

249
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.500
He was separating first light from dark and then

250
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.000
Heavens from sea and then Land from

251
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.600
the sea.

252
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.400
It these things are good.

253
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.300
And there was evening and there was morning the first day the

254
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.100
second day the third day.

255
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.300
What's he created in these first three days? Let's just think about that for a

256
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.400
second.

257
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.700
What is he making?

258
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.100
And that it might be easier to answer that question. Once we get to the next three days,

259
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.700
okay, but I want you to hold that question in your mind for a second. What's he what's

260
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.300
the pattern here?

261
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.100
What is he making the first three days and then what is he making the second three days, so

262
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.000
let's continue.

263
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.600
in verse 14

264
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.100
and God said let there be so once again repetition let

265
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.400
there be lights in the expanse of the Heavens to separate

266
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.300
the day from the night and let them be for signs and

267
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.500
for seasons and for days and years and let them be lights

268
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.900
in the expanse of the Heavens to give light upon the Earth.

269
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.200
and it was so

270
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.000
and God made the two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day

271
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.400
and the Lesser light to rule the night and the Stars.

272
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.400
And God set them in the expanse of the Heavens to

273
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.200
give light on the earth to rule over the day and over the night and

274
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.000
to separate the light from the darkness.

275
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.200
And God saw that it was good and there was

276
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.900
evening and there was morning the fourth day.

277
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.100
Verse 20 and God said let the water swarm of swarms living

278
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.700
creatures and let birds fly above the Earth across the expanse

279
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.000
of the heavens.

280
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.000
So God created the great sea creatures and every living

281
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.200
creature that moves with which the water swarm according to their kinds and

282
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.200
every Winged Bird according to its kind and God saw that

283
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.600
it was good.

284
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.700
And God blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and

285
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.700
fill the waters in the seas and let Birds multiply on

286
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:48.800
the Earth.

287
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.500
And there was evening and there was morning the fifth

288
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:52.700
day.

289
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.400
And God said let the Earth bring forth living creatures

290
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.300
according to their kinds livestock and

291
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.200
creeping things. I could have done without those but God saw that

292
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.100
it was good and beasts of the Earth according to their kinds and

293
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.600
it was so

294
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.500
and God made the beasts of the Earth according to their kinds and the livestock

295
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.500
according to their kinds and everything that Creeps in the ground according to its kind

296
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.300
and God saw that it was good.

297
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.600
My parentheses even spiders then God said

298
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.500
verse 28. I have to remind myself of

299
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.500
that. Let us make man in our image.

300
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.100
After our likeness and let them have dominion over

301
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.500
the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and

302
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.400
over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on

303
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.200
the earth. So God created man in his own image in the image of

304
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.400
God. He created him male and female. He created him. He

305
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.900
created them.

306
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.200
so notice this pattern

307
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.700
that happens.

308
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.700
On the first day. God separates what?

309
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.300
Not yet light from dark, right?

310
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.300
on the first day God separates light from dark

311
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.000
on the fourth day.

312
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.200
What does God make?

313
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.200
And you can you can look back down on your Bible.

314
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.200
What does he make on the fourth day?

315
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.800
Sun and the moon and the stars.

316
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.300
On the second day.

317
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.400
God separates what?

318
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.800
The waters. What is he what is he making?

319
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.200
sky and the sea

320
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.800
And on the fifth day, he makes what?

321
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.200
You can look again.

322
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:34.700
fish and

323
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.400
birds

324
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.900
And then on the sixth day.

325
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.800
He separates. What from what?

326
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.400
the land from the sea

327
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.100
and he makes what?

328
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.100
Livestock creeping things Beasts of the field

329
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.800
and then ultimately finally human beings.

330
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.400
So do you see the pattern there?

331
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.400
The light is filled with the heavenly bodies.

332
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.600
The sea in the sky are filled with the

333
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.900
fish and the birds.

334
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.900
The land is filled.

335
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.300
With animals, yes, but ultimately with human beings

336
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.300
who are told to be fruitful and multiply and fill the

337
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:19.400
Earth.

338
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.300
So there's already something being told to us

339
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.300
about why God makes the world in Genesis 1

340
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:27.900
in this pattern.

341
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.200
The purpose for creation is for God's

342
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.800
people.

343
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.500
human beings

344
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200
His Image bears

345
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.800
to dwell in God's place

346
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.300
the land

347
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.000
that's the reason.

348
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400
Why God makes the world?

349
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.700
For God's people human beings image bears.

350
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.600
to dwell with him in his place

351
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.400
Okay. So already we're seeing something about why God makes the

352
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.400
world this none of this is on your slides.

353
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.400
and what I'm about to say isn't on there either but

354
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.700
It's really important to.

355
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.600
See the order.

356
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.300
And I don't just mean the number the numerical word that we just walked through. I

357
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.100
mean the fact that God has intentionality. He

358
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.500
means to make what he makes.

359
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.400
any means to make it in the order he makes it that's a really

360
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.300
important point that Genesis 1 is making that Moses is

361
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.400
making in these in this first chapter because in ancient

362
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.400
near Eastern times

363
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.600
Other cultures didn't believe that about creation.

364
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.400
I'm not going to go into the Gory details.

365
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.600
But creation of the earth and people

366
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.400
and everything else was a highly chaotic.

367
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.700
I visceral like really gross is what

368
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.300
I'm trying to say process.

369
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.500
It was disgusting.

370
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.200
So just imagine what you're going to imagine right now and make it

371
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.400
10 times worse and you might be getting close to what what other

372
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.700
ancient peoples believed about creation.

373
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.100
The gods would fight and love each other

374
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.000
and the results of those things are creation.

375
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.400
And it's sort of as random as a blood spatter.

376
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.500
Well here.

377
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.200
God isn't making the world.

378
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.500
because of Chaos

379
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.200
But in fact his order he brings order to

380
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:34.800
the chaos.

381
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.600
Through his own words, not through fighting or

382
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.000
loving.

383
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.000
But through speaking.

384
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.500
and so

385
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.100
What we see in Genesis 1 is that creation itself

386
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.500
at creation as a whole everything that's here

387
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.500
exists for a reason. It's not random. It's

388
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.100
not chaotic. It's intended by God.

389
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.400
And we see that there's a specific intention to that namely

390
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.400
that God's people are going to dwell in God's place.

391
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.200
Human beings are not an accident.

392
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.300
Human beings are not an annoyance to the

393
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.900
gods human beings are image Bears

394
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.800
of God. They are representatives of his

395
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.700
authority, which we're going to talk about in just a second.

396
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.600
Okay. So the first thing we want to see in the

397
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.200
story of the Bible is that God intends for his people to

398
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.200
dwell with him in his place and I'm saying that

399
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.400
over and over and over again because it is

400
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.100
critical.

401
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.000
For us to get that at the beginning to understand the rest of

402
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.400
the story.

403
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.700
Let's continue in.

404
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.800
Verse 29. So we've read that there made in

405
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.200
God's image human beings are that he wants them to

406
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.500
be for multiply verse 29 and God said behold. I

407
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.100
have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the

408
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.200
Earth and every tree with seed and it's fruit.

409
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.900
You shall have them for food.

410
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.100
Into every beast of the earth and every bird of the heavens

411
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.800
and everything that creeps on the earth everything that has the breath of life. I

412
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.200
have given every green plant for food and it was so

413
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.800
and God saw everything that he had made and behold. It was very good.

414
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.300
And there was evening and there was morning the sixth day.

415
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.300
Chapter 2 verse 1 that's the heavens and the Earth were finished

416
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.200
and all the hosts all the host

417
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.200
of them and on the seventh day God finished his work that

418
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.400
he had done and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he

419
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.800
had done. So God blessed the seventh day and made it. Holy because on

420
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.400
it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.

421
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.700
So before we jump to the rest of this slide,

422
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.500
which is focusing in on image bearing. I

423
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.100
just want to say one more thing about this pattern.

424
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.300
One of the repetitions that we saw was that God saw that

425
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:55.700
it was good.

426
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.100
And then at the end we saw that God saw that

427
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:00.800
it was very good.

428
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.700
After he made everything.

429
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.100
Just very briefly and we'll come back to this probably in the

430
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.900
last week. If not more often than that and look

431
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.800
God doesn't make junk.

432
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.800
And what he's made he doesn't just throw away.

433
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.500
God cares about me and you

434
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.200
but he cares about everything that he's made.

435
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.100
So God saw that it was good. So I

436
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.700
was very good and then he rested now when

437
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.400
we turn our attention, this is what Genesis

438
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.600
2 does right? So we have two creation accounts Genesis 1 Genesis

439
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.500
2 when we zoom in on human

440
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:40.900
beings

441
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.000
We're going to find more information about what got

442
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.500
intends for us to be his image Bears. So if

443
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.500
you want to think about this way Genesis 1 is kind of like a wide angle

444
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.800
lens. Look at creation.

445
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.800
Here's the whole thing.

446
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.500
You know, by the way on day six created human beings image

447
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:00.800
bears.

448
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.600
Genesis 2 is the zoom lens onto that particular

449
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.700
event. God creating human beings.

450
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.300
Okay, so as we look at Genesis 2 what we're going to find is a

451
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.200
little bit more about what God does and intends for

452
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.700
human beings as His Image bears and I'm not going to necessarily read all of

453
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.000
chapter 2 like we just did.

454
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.700
But I do want you to notice a few things.

455
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.000
First of all, look at verse 7, then the Lord God formed

456
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.900
the man of dust from the ground and breathed

457
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.500
into his nostrils the Breath of Life.

458
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.000
And the Man became a living

459
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.500
creature.

460
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.300
And the Lord God planted a garden and Eden in the East and there he

461
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.500
put the man whom he had formed.

462
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.700
And out of the ground the Lord God made to spring up every tree that

463
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.000
is Pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of

464
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.800
life was in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil.

465
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.200
A river flowed out of Eden to water

466
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.700
the garden and there it divided and became Four Rivers.

467
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.200
The name of the first is the Pichon it is

468
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.000
the one that flowed around the whole land of havilah where there is gold.

469
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.900
And the gold of that land is good bedelium and

470
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.700
Onyx Stone are there.

471
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.100
The name of the second river is the GUI home. It is the one

472
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.300
that float around the whole land of kush and the name of the third river

473
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.100
is the Tigris which flows east of Assyria and the

474
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.200
fourth river is the Euphrates and you might think to yourself.

475
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.200
Okay, great. It was pretty

476
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.000
it's a garden.

477
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.300
But but Moses is giving you.

478
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.400
Moses is giving you a

479
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.100
more specific picture than that

480
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.100
This Garden.

481
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.600
is described

482
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.300
like a temple

483
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.200
God puts Adam inside a temple.

484
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:47.400
Why?

485
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.500
Because that's what human beings are made for.

486
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.300
To worship God and be in his presence.

487
00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.600
And this is going to be really important as we look at say Ezekiel 40 through

488
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.100
48 when God promises to rebuild the Temple.

489
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.800
the rebuilt Temple looks like the Garden of Eden why

490
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.000
because the purpose of the Temple

491
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.500
To put you in the presence of God.

492
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.900
That's where God puts Adam in the beginning.

493
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.100
So he makes this Garden Temple for

494
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.400
Adam.

495
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.100
And in verse 16, he gives Adam instructions or verse 15.

496
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.100
He gives Adam instructions the Lord God took the man and put him

497
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.400
in the Garden of Eden to work it and keep it which is the same two verbs that

498
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.400
Moses uses later on to

499
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.400
describe the work of the priests. Adam is a priest in a

500
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:33.600
temple.

501
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.300
Go in the garden work it and keep it and the Lord God commanded the man

502
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.000
saying you may surely eat of every tree of the garden. But of the tree of

503
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.900
the knowledge of Good and Evil you shall not eat.

504
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.600
For in the day that you eat of it. You shall surely die.

505
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.900
So God puts his people and we're

506
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.100
going to see the creation of Eve in just a second. He puts his people.

507
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:54.900
in his place

508
00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.800
and he gives him his word to obey.

509
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.100
God puts his people in his place and he gives him his word to

510
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.400
obey that is the purpose of creation.

511
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.200
That is the purpose of human beings for them

512
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.200
to dwell in God's place and obey his word.

513
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.600
The purpose of humanity isn't

514
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.300
well, there are lots of things we can mention right the purpose of

515
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.300
humanity isn't to become famous. The purpose of

516
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.400
humanity isn't to be vain glorious. The purpose of humanity isn't to

517
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.800
be comfortable or rich or safe.

518
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.700
or powerful

519
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.500
or rule over other people or to care

520
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.100
for their families. I mean, although some of those things at least

521
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.200
like caring for your families are good things. That's not their ultimate purpose.

522
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.400
The ultimate purpose of human beings is to live with God forever and

523
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.100
obey his word.

524
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.500
That's not what the ancient near East would have said the cultures

525
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.400
around Israel. It's not what our culture

526
00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:58.900
today says.

527
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:03.800
And we'll find out.

528
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.000
About that in just a second when we get into chapter 3.

529
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.900
Verse 18 the Lord God said is not good

530
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.700
that the man should be alone. I will make a help help or

531
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.000
fit for him.

532
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.700
Now out of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every

533
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.900
bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them and whatever

534
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.700
the man called every living creature that was its name the

535
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.100
man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of

536
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.600
the heavens and every beast of the field.

537
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.100
But for Adam there was not found to help her fit for him. So the Lord

538
00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.300
God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and while he

539
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.500
slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.

540
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.100
And the red that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman

541
00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.100
and brought her to the man. Then the man

542
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.300
said this at last is bone of my bones and Flesh of My

543
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:49.500
Flesh.

544
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.000
She shall be called woman because she was taken out of

545
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.200
man.

546
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.200
Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to

547
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:57.700
his wife.

548
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.300
And they shall become one flesh.

549
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.200
In the man and his wife were both naked and we're not ashamed.

550
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.900
Remember how I pronounce that they were naked? Okay. It's

551
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.800
gonna be important a second.

552
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.500
Listen God, I've labored this enough. God makes

553
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.100
his people Adam and Eve to live in his place

554
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.200
this Garden temple in obey his word.

555
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.000
That's why they exist.

556
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.600
If we were to sum up everything that we've seen in Genesis 1

557
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.600
and 2 that God says about Humanity it

558
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.000
is that image bearing consists of the following.

559
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.600
Adam and Eve are supposed to have dominion

560
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.700
over the whole earth. They're supposed to rule.

561
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.000
And I'm going to say these four things a lot

562
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.600
over the next four weeks. Okay, so just get ready to hear these repeated over

563
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.500
and over and over again.

564
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.400
God makes human beings to rule or have dominion over

565
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.100
the whole Earth.

566
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.100
They're supposed to be representatives of

567
00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:54.800
his authority.

568
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.300
In the ancient near East if you were a king and you

569
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.400
were called an image bear it was because you represented the

570
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.400
authority of the god that you served.

571
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.600
Adam and Eve or if you made a statue same thing Adam

572
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.700
and Eve are living representatives of God's

573
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.100
Authority in this place that he's made

574
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.200
for them the only God.

575
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.300
Right. No, there's no other God in Genesis 1 is there.

576
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.300
There's nothing else in Genesis 1 besides God until

577
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:21.800
he makes it.

578
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.000
Adam and Eve are the living representatives of

579
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.100
the authority of the one true God rule.

580
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.500
They rule over God's place.

581
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.500
Secondly God tells them to obey his

582
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.400
word. They're supposed to rule well.

583
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.700
by obeying well

584
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.400
God tells him to rule he doesn't to obey and then

585
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.200
he tells them to be fruitful and multiply.

586
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.300
So God doesn't want it to just be Adam and Eve forever. He wants

587
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.400
them to make more image bearers.

588
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.400
Make more representatives of yahweh's authority

589
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.100
throughout the whole earth fill the Earth.

590
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.500
with worshipers of Yahweh

591
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.800
and then he finally tells them and we just read it. He tells Adam specifically

592
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.400
but this is also free to cultivate and keep

593
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.300
the garden care for God's place

594
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.400
It's supposed to rule over it.

595
00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.500
Obey God's word.

596
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.400
Be fruitful multiply care for creation. Those

597
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.500
are the four tasks.

598
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.800
That God gave to Adam and Eve.

599
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.300
rule obey

600
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.800
be fruitful and care for God's place.

601
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.200
ultimately

602
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.900
Ultimately, the purpose God has for mankind

603
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.600
for humankind.

604
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.800
Is to dwell with him and worship him. That's it.

605
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.700
That's why we exist.

606
00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.600
Now, why do I belabor Genesis

607
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.000
1 and 2 so much why have I talked for a

608
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.600
good half hour?

609
00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.600
about two chapters of the Bible

610
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.300
when we're supposed to get through the whole thing.

611
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.400
in four weeks

612
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.100
and I'm going to say the same thing about Genesis 3 in just a

613
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.200
second if we don't understand.

614
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.400
Why God made what he made?

615
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.800
We won't understand what he does when

616
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.700
he redeems it.

617
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.600
If we don't understand why God made what he made why God

618
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.100
made what he made We're Not Gonna understand what he's doing.

619
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.000
When he comes himself in the person of his son.

620
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.600
incarnate

621
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.400
to save it to redeem it.

622
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.000
We have to understand the beginning to understand

623
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.600
the end.

624
00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.300
a lot of times when we read Genesis 1

625
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:49.700
and 2

626
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.000
we read Genesis 1 and 2 just for

627
00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.300
I don't want to quite say argumentative purposes, but maybe that's the

628
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.700
right word to use. We read it for argumentative purposes.

629
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.200
We want to argue with somebody who thinks the world was

630
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.200
made by atheistic Evolution. We

631
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.100
want to argue with somebody who thinks that marriage is not

632
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.600
just between one man. And one woman we want to argue with somebody who

633
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.600
thinks XYZ about whatever issue.

634
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.400
And yes.

635
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.200
The Bible does provide us with good arguments in

636
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.300
defense of our faith.

637
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.200
But more fundamentally Genesis 1 and 2

638
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.900
is giving us a vision for what life should have

639
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:30.200
been.

640
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.800
Had sinned not entered the world.

641
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.100
And therefore it's giving us a vision of what it will be.

642
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.600
when Jesus returns in glory

643
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.300
okay, so that's that's why we're belaboring Genesis 1 and

644
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.200
2 and also to see

645
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.200
As we turn and you want to turn to Genesis 3 as we

646
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.500
see the effects of sin on this

647
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.000
creation. So we've talked through the first chapter of

648
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.900
the Bible in the creation narrative.

649
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.500
Now, we want to go to chapter 2, which is chapter three

650
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.500
of Genesis, but chapter 2 of our story The Bible second plot

651
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.400
point the fall.

652
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.800
And again, this only takes up one chapter.

653
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.400
But if you can if you can get the first three chapters of Genesis.

654
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.800
That's going to go a long long way for

655
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.500
you to understand the rest of the Bible.

656
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.600
okay, so Genesis 3

657
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.000
and I'm gonna read Porsche significant portions

658
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.500
of this now the serpent was more crafty than

659
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.400
any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made

660
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.200
notice that for I mean just I just kind of want you guys to read really

661
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.500
closely with me for a little bit notice that now the

662
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.900
serpent was more crafty than what

663
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.000
Any other beast of the field?

664
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.600
What what did?

665
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.200
What did God just give Adam authority over?

666
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.700
every beast of the field

667
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.300
this serpent shows up and this is some this is something that Adam

668
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.700
already has been given authority over.

669
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.300
And yet he said to the woman and you got I

670
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:17.900
mean you got to notice.

671
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.700
He said to the woman did God actually

672
00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.500
say.

673
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.600
there is not a Temptation known to man that

674
00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.900
did not begin with did God actually say

675
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.300
don't do that.

676
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.100
If you think about any Temptation you've ever faced.

677
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.400
the serpent subtly Whispers in your ear

678
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.000
God actually say you shouldn't do that.

679
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.300
And notice what he does did God actually say you shall not eat.

680
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.500
Of any tree in the garden, is that what God actually said?

681
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.300
No, we just read it.

682
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.500
He didn't tell Adam not to eat of any tree.

683
00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.100
Eve to her credit gets it right. She says

684
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.300
the woman said to the servant. Well, she gets right at first we may eat

685
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.100
of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said You shall not

686
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.100
eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden so far so good.

687
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.100
Neither shall you touch it lest? You die. Did

688
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.000
God ever tell Adam and Eve not to touch the tree?

689
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:25.300
No.

690
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.400
I told him not to eat. It didn't say don't touch it. That's probably

691
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.300
not a good idea to touch it. I mean, that's fair.

692
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.900
But he never says that so Eve responds sort

693
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.100
of.

694
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.900
Correctly to this question.

695
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.400
But the serpent first attacks God's word.

696
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.300
Did God actually say the first attack in temptation

697
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.100
is to attack God's word. Did God actually

698
00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.000
say don't do this.

699
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.500
Eve to her credit

700
00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.100
gets it mostly right here and says well, yeah, he told us not

701
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:58.600
to eat of this fruit.

702
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.100
So the serpent shifts tactics, okay.

703
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:04.900
It says the serpent.

704
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:06.600
verse 4

705
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.300
you will not surely die.

706
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.000
For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will

707
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.900
be like God knowing Good and Evil.

708
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.700
The serpent shifts from questioning God's word. Did

709
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.200
God really say?

710
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.200
to questioning God's love

711
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.100
Okay. Yeah, maybe he did tell you not to do that. But you know why?

712
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.800
Because he doesn't want you to be like him.

713
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.700
He'll be jealous.

714
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.100
It's not it's not a good rule.

715
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.700
To rule he made up for his own jealousy.

716
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.200
And we hear this we hear this

717
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.400
all the time.

718
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.300
in our culture

719
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.600
on issues of gender and sexuality did God

720
00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.300
really say

721
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:01.700
don't do this.

722
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.000
And here's how you hear that today.

723
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.100
It's not quite that obvious. It's well that law

724
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.200
is in the Old Testament.

725
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.700
And we don't have to obey that anymore.

726
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.100
That's still a version of they've got

727
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.400
actually say don't do this.

728
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.700
But the other way and this is the much more prominent means by which Satan

729
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.600
attacks these days at least in my opinion.

730
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.000
Is if God really loved you.

731
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.400
He wouldn't tell you not to do that.

732
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.000
If God really loved you.

733
00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.200
He'd let you do what you want in this area of your life.

734
00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.900
If God really loved you, he'd understand.

735
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.600
Why you want to do this and it would be okay.

736
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.500
Some versions of that are just God loves you and accepts

737
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:52.900
you as you are.

738
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.300
Doesn't expect anything different of you. That's how we hear that

739
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.300
in our culture. And that's what Satan is doing. He's saying listen if God

740
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.300
really loved you.

741
00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.500
If he actually cared about you and not

742
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.200
just about himself.

743
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.700
He wouldn't prohibit this.

744
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.600
He cheer you on.

745
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.300
Have you heard that? Do you know I mean do you resonate with

746
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.100
that kind of Temptation This is

747
00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.200
what Satan is doing and if he's not doing it to you. I can guarantee you

748
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.300
he's doing it to your kids or your grandkids or your

749
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.000
nieces or your nephews or your kids in your class?

750
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.400
Because that is what my kids are hearing

751
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.800
all the time in school.

752
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.300
If God really loved you if God was a

753
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:40.800
god of love.

754
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.900
He wouldn't prohibit this or that.

755
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.300
That's exactly what Satan does the beginning he doesn't change his ways. He's not smart

756
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.100
enough to do that.

757
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.600
He's doing the same old thing that he was doing since the

758
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.900
beginning questioning God's word questioning God's love.

759
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.400
Verse 6. So when the woman saw that the tree noticed

760
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:01.600
that

761
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.800
Look at this. So when the woman saw that the tree was good.

762
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.500
What do you hear?

763
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.900
And God saw that it was good.

764
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.200
And there was evening it was morning. Well now Eve saw

765
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.500
that it was good not by God's estimation.

766
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.000
but by her own

767
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.000
God's Eve saw that it was good for food that

768
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.300
it was a delight to the eyes that the

769
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.100
tree was to be desired to make one wise. She took of

770
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.000
its fruit and ate.

771
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.300
And she also gave some to her husband who was with her and he

772
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.400
ate I guess Adams just lounging around back here while this Serpent's talking

773
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:39.800
to his wife.

774
00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.200
Then the eyes of both were open verse 7

775
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.800
and they knew that they were naked.

776
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.400
Somebody knew the difference and they sewed fig leaves together and made

777
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.600
themselves loin claws.

778
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.000
And they heard the sound of the Lord God Walking In The

779
00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.100
Garden in the cool of the day.

780
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.400
In the man and his wife hid himself from the presence of

781
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.900
the Lord God Among the Trees of the garden.

782
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.500
These okay. Look I'm from Alabama. So I

783
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.800
like read things in Alabama. And so when

784
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.700
I see this and I kind of think about

785
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.400
my parents acting like they couldn't

786
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.300
find me playing hide and seek but the Lord God called the

787
00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.200
man and said then where you at and he said I heard the

788
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.100
sound of some of you in the garden.

789
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.900
Or answer the sound of you in the garden. I was afraid because I was naked.

790
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.300
And I hid myself and he said who told you that you

791
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.200
were naked not naked. Have you eaten of the

792
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.200
tree of which I commanded you not to eat? Okay, look you all know the

793
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.400
difference between naked and naked.

794
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.400
This is my grandma taught me this long time ago.

795
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.600
Naked is when you ain't got no clothes on.

796
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.500
Nick it is when you ain't got no clothes on you're doing something y'all not to be doing. Okay. So

797
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.200
Adam and Eve went from knowing they were

798
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.000
naked knowing they were naked and

799
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:56.700
verse 12

800
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.200
after God asked him notice this he said who told you

801
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.400
that you were naked. Have you eaten up the tree which

802
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.200
I commanded you not to eat. Of course. He knows the answer to this but he's as he's

803
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.400
asking them to confess.

804
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.200
Of course God knows what happened, but he's he's putting them

805
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.900
in the process of confession instead

806
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.600
of confessing. What does Adam do?

807
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.200
What we all do the man said that old woman over there

808
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.000
whom he gave to be with me. She gave me the fruit of the tree and I ate

809
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.100
Then the Lord God said to the woman. Okay, what's this

810
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.300
you have done? And the woman said it was that snake over there? That made

811
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:32.400
me.

812
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.000
both of them

813
00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.200
shift the blame

814
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:37.900
to someone else

815
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.800
and this is what we all do.

816
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:43.900
when we sin

817
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.400
Satan hasn't changed his tactics.

818
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.100
And human beings haven't changed our response.

819
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.200
None of us are wise enough for either.

820
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.700
Satan won't wise up. Neither will we?

821
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.500
Every time we sin.

822
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.900
What's our first reaction?

823
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.200
I can guarantee you most of us unless you

824
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:14.100
are the most Sanctified person on the earth who you might be sitting in here chances

825
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.100
are you're not but maybe you are.

826
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.500
maybe it's all of you and I'm just the only one here is still a sinner, but my first

827
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.600
reaction at least is

828
00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.100
look

829
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.700
Okay, this is what happened.

830
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.400
Like I only did this because

831
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.500
Like this guy was in front of me, and he was going really slow and

832
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.100
was making me really mad. I was late to work and the only

833
00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.000
reason I started yelling and getting mad is because I didn't want to miss my meeting.

834
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.200
Anger. Okay. Yeah, but I mean, that's what

835
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:42.400
we do.

836
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.400
We blame somebody else.

837
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.800
For our sin, and that's exactly what Adam and Eve done do and

838
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.900
so then the Lord turns to the snake.

839
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.300
In this the snake, there's no response. He's just like yeah the Lord

840
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.900
God said to the serpent because you have done this cursed. Are

841
00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.000
you above all livestock?

842
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.200
And above all Beasts of the field on your belly. You

843
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.700
shall go and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.

844
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.200
I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your Offspring and

845
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.100
her Offspring. He shall bruise your head and you shall Bruce his heal. We're

846
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:16.700
going to come back to that.

847
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.100
in a little bit, but notice what he

848
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.500
says to the woman and the man so the woman he said

849
00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.800
I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing.

850
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.800
In pain, you shall bring forth children your desire

851
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.000
shall be for your husband and he shall rule

852
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.800
over you.

853
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.300
And before we move on to what he says to Adam,

854
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.500
I just want you to notice.

855
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.800
So what are the effects of sin?

856
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.500
on Eve

857
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.700
it's going to hurt when you have babies.

858
00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.200
And you're not going to want to make babies because you're always going to be mad at your

859
00:42:59.200 --> 00:42:59.300
husband.

860
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.100
Is essentially what that is?

861
00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.200
In pain all the women are laughing and none of them men are so

862
00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.500
like it's gonna hurt when you have babies in pain.

863
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.000
You shall bring forth children.

864
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.500
Not only that but the the means

865
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.500
of bringing forth children procreating with

866
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.200
your husband your desire is going to be for him,

867
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.500
but he will rule over you. There will be Strife in your

868
00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:26.900
relationship.

869
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.100
It's going to be hard to have babies and to make babies. And what does

870
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.000
that affect in terms of those tasks?

871
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.500
That we went over.

872
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.800
Rule. Obey care

873
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.300
And what?

874
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.800
Be fruitful and multiply.

875
00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.200
It's going to be hard to be fruitful multiply when you don't want to be fruitful and

876
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.200
it's going to hurt to multiply.

877
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.400
That's essentially What's Happening Here?

878
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.300
And then notice what he says to Adam.

879
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.200
Verse 17 to Adam. He said by the way, my wife

880
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.100
when we we had Grace her epidural didn't work.

881
00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.300
And some of y'all are like why did she even need an epidural but I support my

882
00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.300
wife. It was great. I was like, yeah get an epidural. I don't care and so

883
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:13.800
she gets one and it doesn't work which is a real thing and in

884
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.500
the middle of Labor she just says why did

885
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.800
Eve have to eat the fruit so

886
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:24.200
I mean, I feel like that's probably something most women Proclaim during childbirth at

887
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.300
least in their heads to Adam. He said because you have

888
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.400
listened to the voice of your wife and remember that phrase by the way, we probably

889
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.200
won't get to the next instance of it tonight. But

890
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.200
just remember that to Adam he said because you have listened to

891
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.000
the voice of your wife.

892
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.100
Rather than what right? It's not. I mean the issue is

893
00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.700
not listening to your wife. That's not the problem.

894
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.100
Because you have listened to the voice of your wife instead of

895
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:46.500
what?

896
00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:48.900
the voice of God

897
00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.700
The issue isn't that Adam was you know?

898
00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.500
Being an effeminate Man by listening to his wife the

899
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.500
issue was that he listened to someone else's voice?

900
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.900
Rather than God's voice.

901
00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:04.900
That's the problem.

902
00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.900
Which makes him by the way fail in his task as a

903
00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:11.000
man?

904
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.200
says to Adam

905
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.200
because you have listened to the voice of your wife.

906
00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.000
And have eaten of the okay. I got

907
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.300
to stop again. Think about what we heard in Genesis 1, what

908
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.200
did you hear over and over and over and over and over and over and over

909
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:27.300
again?

910
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.300
And God said

911
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.400
the voice that we hear

912
00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.100
in Genesis 1 and 2 loud and clear

913
00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.400
the repetition the power The Authority that

914
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.100
we hear in Genesis 1 and 2 is the voice of

915
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.800
the one true and living God.

916
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.600
In the voices that we hear in Genesis 3 when?

917
00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.200
The serpent shows up are not the voice of God, but the

918
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.200
voice of the serpent and then the voice of his wife.

919
00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.000
And again, the issue is not listening

920
00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.400
to your wife or whatever. The issue is.

921
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.800
Here's this voice, which it makes sense to listen to.

922
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.300
The voice of the only true and living God and you've

923
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.600
listened to some other voice over here.

924
00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:21.600
What what Moses is doing is trying to show us how?

925
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.300
and I'm sorry if I offend you I'm talking about myself here how

926
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:25.800
stupid

927
00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.900
we are as human beings.

928
00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:29.700
we have

929
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.400
the word of the Living God

930
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.400
right here.

931
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.300
And what do we choose to listen to most of time? What do I choose

932
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.000
to listen to I choose to listen to my own voice?

933
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.400
To the voice of the serpent to the voice of somebody else who's giving

934
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.100
me bad advice.

935
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.200
again, maybe maybe everybody in this room is going to be denied it

936
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.400
as a saint on Pond death, but for me at least

937
00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.500
I'm still struggling with that.

938
00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.400
And that's what Moses is showing us here in Genesis

939
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.000
1 and 2 and this is going to matter for the story of Israel because Israel

940
00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.800
over and over again, here's directly from

941
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:08.700
the mouth of God.

942
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.100
And then they go and listen to somebody else.

943
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.300
I'm I can't help but get ahead of myself and then Jesus shows up.

944
00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.900
And he gets baptized.

945
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.000
In the heavens open the dove descends and the voice of

946
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.800
the father says this is my son.

947
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:34.100
My beloved Son whom I'm well pleased what listen to

948
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.800
him?

949
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.100
So he says because you have listened to the voice of

950
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:41.600
your wife.

951
00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.900
And have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you you

952
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.100
shall not eat of it. This is like what with our

953
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:51.100
kids, you know, it's like you remember that remember when I said don't do

954
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:51.200
that.

955
00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.500
Then you did it. I said don't do that. That's what

956
00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:58.100
God is saying.

957
00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.200
Hey kid

958
00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.600
Remember how I said don't eat of it. You just

959
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.700
eight of it cursed is the ground because of you.

960
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.100
notice cursed

961
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.800
Is the serpent above all livestock cursed is the ground?

962
00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:15.500
Because of Adam this is in contrast to the goodness

963
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.100
of creation later on. It's in contrast to the

964
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.100
blessing over Abraham.

965
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.200
In pain, you shall eat of it all the days of your

966
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.700
life Eve in pain. You shall bring forth children Adam in

967
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.300
pain you shall eat from the ground.

968
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.000
thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you rather than

969
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.900
the plants that yielded food in

970
00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.600
Genesis 1 the green things.

971
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.400
And you shall eat the plants of the field?

972
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.400
By the sweat of your face, you shall eat bread.

973
00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.100
So you return to the ground for out of it you were taken

974
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.000
for your dust.

975
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.500
Into dust you shall return.

976
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.100
What's this? What does this affect? What does Sin affect

977
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:01.600
for Adam?

978
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.800
For Eve, it was beef fruitful and multiply for Adam. It's care for

979
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.200
creation.

980
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.900
Adams told to cultivate and keep the garden.

981
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.200
To work it and to keep it.

982
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.700
And what God is saying here is your work is going to be futile.

983
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.300
Rather than bringing forth green things to eat. It's going

984
00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.000
to bring forth thorns and thistles.

985
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:39.500
sin

986
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.300
effects

987
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:43.800
everything

988
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.400
sin affects

989
00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.700
everything every aspect of creation.

990
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.100
Think about what we've just heard.

991
00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.300
now what we focus on and rightly so out of this chapter

992
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:02.500
is

993
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.300
and we haven't read all the way through chapter 3. Let me just I'll just

994
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.300
read chapter 3 the end very quickly verse 20 of the man called his wife's

995
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.400
name Eve because she was the mother of the living.

996
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.300
And the Lord God Made For Adam and for his wife garments of skins and

997
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:16.800
clothed them.

998
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.200
Then the Lord God said behold the man has become like

999
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.200
one of us and knowing good and evil now lest he reach

1000
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:27.000
out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever. Therefore

1001
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.300
the Lord God sent him out from the Garden of Eden

1002
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.000
to work the ground from which he was taken.

1003
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.300
He drove out the man and at the east of the Garden of Eden,

1004
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.100
he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way

1005
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:38.600
to guard.

1006
00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:40.900
the way to the Tree of Life

1007
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:42.600
now

1008
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.700
notice sin affects everything and

1009
00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:50.200
especially we rightly focus

1010
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.300
on this especially our relationship with the Lord.

1011
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.800
death enters the world both physical and spiritual

1012
00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.700
to dust you shall return physical death.

1013
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.400
And they're kicked out of God's presence spiritual death.

1014
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.600
sin breaks

1015
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.200
our relationship with God

1016
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.800
but notice what else sin does as

1017
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.300
ultimately important as that is right. The rest

1018
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.500
of these are not as important as the fact that our relationship with

1019
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.000
God is broken, but they're still important notice the rest

1020
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.500
of these listen affects Adam and Eve's

1021
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.600
relationship with each other.

1022
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.500
Number one, they're both going to die and probably

1023
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.000
not at the same time. So death breaks relationships.

1024
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.500
But also remember what he says the eve not just pain in

1025
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.200
childbearing but there's gonna be Strife between you and

1026
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:52.500
your husband.

1027
00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.100
Sin affects us.

1028
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.500
vertically our relationship to God

1029
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.300
But it also affects us horizontally if we kept reading in Genesis 4,

1030
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.900
we see that relational break.

1031
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:09.100
even

1032
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.400
more dramatically with Cain and Abel and then lamech.

1033
00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.100
murdering each other

1034
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:20.400
sin affects our relationship with God it affects our relationship with

1035
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.600
each other and it also affects our relationship with creation itself.

1036
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.300
Cursed is the ground.

1037
00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.500
Because Of You the ground the land remember God's

1038
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.500
people and God's place

1039
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.400
This place that God made for you now, it's cursed because

1040
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:34.600
of you.

1041
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.800
Fix our relationships vertically horizontally and

1042
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.500
with creation itself, but it also affects our ability

1043
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.900
to do what God made us to do.

1044
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.000
What didn't Adam and Eve do in the garden?

1045
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.000
That they were supposed to do out of those four things. What did they not do?

1046
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.100
The easiest one is they didn't obey.

1047
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:01.400
right

1048
00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.300
How about Adam should have karate chopped that serpent into

1049
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.300
nothing the second he entered the garden. They didn't rule well

1050
00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:10.600
either.

1051
00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.700
We'll see that later with Israel Israel supposed to drive out the enemies of

1052
00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.600
God from the land and what do they do instead?

1053
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.400
They let him just sit there.

1054
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.900
and talk kind of like

1055
00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:25.800
Adam did with the serpent, right?

1056
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.100
They don't obey they don't rule.

1057
00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:30.500
that's

1058
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.600
Sin, they don't obey because they don't rule.

1059
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.400
And therefore they are no longer able to

1060
00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.800
in the way that God intended be fruitful and multiply or care

1061
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.400
for creation.

1062
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.400
everything beautiful

1063
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.500
that we saw in Genesis 1 and

1064
00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.300
2 has been broken by Adam and Eve sin.

1065
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.300
Everything beautiful that we saw in Genesis 1

1066
00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:01.200
and 2 has been broken by Adam and Eve sin.

1067
00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:02.900
to the point where

1068
00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.300
there's no way for Adam and Eve to get back in.

1069
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.300
What does God do at the end of Genesis 3 he puts two

1070
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.300
cherubim two angels and not like the ones that

1071
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.500
you see on Precious Moments.

1072
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.700
But like six wings eyes all around kind of weird stuff puts

1073
00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:24.300
two angels with flaming swords.

1074
00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.600
on either side of the garden

1075
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:35.200
everything beautiful in Genesis 1 and 2 has been broken by

1076
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.100
sin Adam and Eve sin and Genesis 3

1077
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.800
And there's no way for them to get back in.

1078
00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.100
now, of course the beautiful thing

1079
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.900
in the midst of the Brokenness is that God provides hope

1080
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:57.000
so we'll I'm going to give you a very brief a few

1081
00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.200
comments on Genesis 3 and

1082
00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.800
hope but for the rest of our time.

1083
00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.100
What we're going to do is next week. We'll walk through

1084
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:06.900
the story of Israel.

1085
00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.000
And walk through the promises that God makes to

1086
00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.300
restore what Adam lost.

1087
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:18.000
In the third week. We'll talk about how Jesus fulfills

1088
00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.100
those promises to restore. What Adam lost.

1089
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.600
in the gospels and acts

1090
00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.300
and then in the final week, we'll talk about how we can live in light

1091
00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.200
of those and then look forward to the second coming of

1092
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.200
Jesus when he will bring full and final

1093
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.400
Victory and restore what Adam's law

1094
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.000
what Adam lost for good but

1095
00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.900
I don't want to jump too far ahead. So just Genesis 3 again.

1096
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.000
God does promise redemption in the midst of

1097
00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:44.700
this Brokenness.

1098
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.200
He says to the serpent, first of all, and I read this

1099
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.600
but didn't comment on it. He says to the serpent.

1100
00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.200
in verses 14 and 15

1101
00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.700
because you have done this cursed. Are you above all livestock and

1102
00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.400
above all Beasts of the field on your belly shall

1103
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.500
go and dust you shall eat of it all the days of your life.

1104
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:09.200
And there's so much I want to say but I'm not gonna say it.

1105
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:10.600
Not because it's not.

1106
00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:12.400
appropriate

1107
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:17.700
Okay, look just dust I'm gonna say it. Anyway, what's dust

1108
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.100
a sign of at the end of this chapter?

1109
00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.400
From dust you came to us your turn death.

1110
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.500
Dust is a sign of death.

1111
00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.600
It's also a sign of cursing.

1112
00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.500
Cursed are you you'll eat dust all

1113
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:35.100
the days of your life.

1114
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.500
This is just a little nugget. I'm like, I'm just pause for

1115
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:43.300
a second just a little night dust is the sign of cursing separation

1116
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.400
from God judgment.

1117
00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.200
death

1118
00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:57.700
after

1119
00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.300
Israel

1120
00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.400
fails in the wilderness

1121
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.000
What does Moses have to do to?

1122
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:08.800
Intercede for the people do you remember?

1123
00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.300
Is to grind.

1124
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.100
one of the bronze the Bronze Statues

1125
00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:22.200
the sign of their Rebellion down to dust and then drink it.

1126
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.100
Mix it with the dust of the ground.

1127
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:28.300
It takes judgment in himself.

1128
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:30.800
and then

1129
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.500
what does Jesus do?

1130
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.300
In The Garden of Gethsemane

1131
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.700
He says to God if it's your will let this cup.

1132
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:43.700
pass from me

1133
00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.400
but not my will but yours be done.

1134
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.500
He drinks the cup.

1135
00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:53.900
of God's Wrath

1136
00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.500
These are the kinds of things I mean think about this.

1137
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.300
Cursed is the ground because of you from thorns and thorns and

1138
00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:04.900
thistles you shall bring forth from it all the days of your life. What is the Ram's Horn

1139
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:05.800
caught in?

1140
00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:08.600
In Genesis 22 when?

1141
00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:11.600
Abraham takes Isaac up one of the mountain

1142
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.900
Thorns and thistles, what is Jesus's crown

1143
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.100
made of?

1144
00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:18.800
thorns

1145
00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.700
Right the whole Bible is one book.

1146
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:28.200
pointing to one person Jesus Christ

1147
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.000
written by one author of the Holy Spirit

1148
00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:38.200
Those I mean, we're probably I'm probably not gonna mention that again, but these little

1149
00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.400
details that we often just pass over.

1150
00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:44.100
That's over that we often just pass over.

1151
00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.500
Are actually intended by God and

1152
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.800
by the human author to signify something namely.

1153
00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:53.500
that

1154
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:57.900
everything that was broken by Adam sin

1155
00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:00.300
is going to be restored in the person and

1156
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:00.900
work of Jesus Christ.

1157
00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.200
This is what God promises in Genesis 3

1158
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.600
in verse 15. I will put enmity between you and the woman and

1159
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.500
between your Offspring and her offspring.

1160
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.600
He shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel.

1161
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.500
This is the first promise of the Gospel in the

1162
00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:17.800
Bible.

1163
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.700
If you want a big word, I'm not going to spell it out. It's called Proto Evangelion.

1164
00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.200
I'm not going to say it again because nobody cares but

1165
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.500
me but that means First Gospel.

1166
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.500
first preaching of the Gospel

1167
00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.400
This is the first proclamation of the Gospel in the

1168
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.400
Bible that God through the seed

1169
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.600
of woman. This one man. That's going to come from Eve. God

1170
00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.800
is going to destroy destroy.

1171
00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.900
the source of sin

1172
00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:52.300
God through the seed of woman is going

1173
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:55.600
to destroy the source of sin and by destroying sin

1174
00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.900
at its source he is going to restore creation

1175
00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.500
from all of sin's effects.

1176
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:05.300
when I

1177
01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:06.900
when I

1178
01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:08.800
first started

1179
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.800
seeing these things in the Bible through the help of others.

1180
01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.400
The Boston Red Sox had just

1181
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.300
won the World Series for the first time. I remember

1182
01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.800
that and and the I don't know about that, but

1183
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.000
The slogan if you remember

1184
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.600
was reverse the curse, right as they were making the run through the playoffs and

1185
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.300
everything was reversed the curse reverse the curse.

1186
01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.700
And I like to I like to think of Genesis 3:15

1187
01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:38.700
as God's promise to reverse the

1188
01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.100
curse.

1189
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.800
He is going not the curse of the Bambino the curse of

1190
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.800
Adam. He's going to reverse it through the

1191
01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.700
seed of woman.

1192
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.700
so Redemption

1193
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:54.000
is that third plot point? I don't really want necessarily

1194
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.300
the slide up because you guys are gonna start writing and we're

1195
01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:59.400
not going to talk about any of it for the rest of the time but the third

1196
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.600
chapter of the Bible is redemption and this

1197
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.300
stretches from Genesis, 3:15 all the

1198
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.300
way to Revelation 20.

1199
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.800
So that's the most of the Bible is this chapter on Redemption?

1200
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.500
Creation fall Redemption and Revelation 21

1201
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.800
and 22 New Creation or restoration? However,

1202
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.100
you want to say that.

1203
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.000
And this is where Redemption starts this is the

1204
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.400
promise that God makes to restore what Adam

1205
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.100
lost to reverse the curse of Adam.

1206
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:32.100
There's a couple of other signs that God is not

1207
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:35.400
leaving Adam and Eve just to die without hope

1208
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600
he closed them.

1209
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.600
in Genesis, 3:21

1210
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.000
And it says that he clothed them.

1211
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.000
in garments of skins

1212
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.300
now unless it's their own skin, which I'm going to go with

1213
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.300
probably not it's the skin of some other

1214
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.000
creature.

1215
01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.500
So more than likely this skin of

1216
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.000
another creature comes from the first sacrifice.

1217
01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.400
That restoration to relationship with God is

1218
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.600
somehow related to death blood covering.

1219
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.600
Those are all themes that you probably can hear the rest

1220
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.400
of the Bible in.

1221
01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.100
And then he also I mean even in kicking them out notice what he

1222
01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.400
says about when he kicks them out.

1223
01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:26.800
In verse 22 the the second sentence in

1224
01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.000
verse 22 now.

1225
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.000
Lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of

1226
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.200
life and eat and live forever.

1227
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.200
He drives him out what he doesn't let him stay in

1228
01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.200
the garden not because he doesn't want Adam and

1229
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.600
Eve in his presence anymore. But because of Adam and Eve stay.

1230
01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.000
And they eat from the Tree of Life.

1231
01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.400
They live in a state of sin of separation from God.

1232
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:51.800
forever

1233
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.400
so even driving them out.

1234
01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.300
Is a sign for them that he's going to bring them back in.

1235
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.200
Just one more little thing and I may mention this

1236
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.400
again. I don't know but it's

1237
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.600
I don't want to miss it if I don't notice that.

1238
01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.600
In verse 24, I already said he puts these two.

1239
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.600
Crazy looking monster things on the

1240
01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.500
side of the entrance to the garden.

1241
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:21.600
and

1242
01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.400
so I just I need you to visualize for a second.

1243
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.600
Here is a large door.

1244
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.200
with two angels standing on

1245
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:33.700
the side

1246
01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:37.100
and if you were to be able to walk through that door.

1247
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.700
You would be in the presence of God.

1248
01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:41.700
in his place

1249
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.100
I'm sure I'll bring this up next week, but just just to help

1250
01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:50.600
you start and if you already are thinking this way when you read the Bible great, but

1251
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.200
if you aren't.

1252
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.400
think about this as Israel is told

1253
01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.400
to build the Tabernacle and then the temple

1254
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.100
What stands at the entrance into the temple itself?

1255
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.500
two columns

1256
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.700
named Boaz and Jakin

1257
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.300
and if you were to pass.

1258
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.200
Through those two columns you would enter into the presence of the Living

1259
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:16.500
God.

1260
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:18.700
and then

1261
01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.200
Then sorry I get like little Goosebumps when

1262
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.900
I talk think about the Bible sometimes then when Jesus.

1263
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.700
On the third day.

1264
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.400
when Peter and John arrive at

1265
01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:34.800
the tomb

1266
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.900
what does it say about what they see at the team?

1267
01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.000
They saw two angels.

1268
01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600
Standing on either side.

1269
01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:45.900
if you go in

1270
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.200
Where are you? You're in the presence of God, that doesn't make any sense. That's

1271
01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:51.700
a tomb.

1272
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:57.600
It's because the presence of God is now in the

1273
01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:01.000
person of Jesus Christ who has died and risen

1274
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.100
again from the dead.

1275
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.200
These are the kinds of things that if you'll just

1276
01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.600
take close attention to the details.

1277
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.300
like this

1278
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.100
I don't I don't read this way because you know,

1279
01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:19.300
I have certain degrees or whatever. Somebody said to me one

1280
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.000
time just pay attention to repeat it things and weird stuff.

1281
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.600
And that's all I do. There's not a secret sauce. Just listen

1282
01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.300
for repeated words and phrases. My students are

1283
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.200
like, you know, how do you see those connections? Well,

1284
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:32.500
number one

1285
01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.200
other people Point them out, but number two.

1286
01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.200
If you just will read your Bible over and over and over

1287
01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:39.400
again.

1288
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.200
Which may sound tedious at first if you

1289
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.300
will just read it.

1290
01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.700
These things will start to become apparent to

1291
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:48.900
you.

1292
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.500
The biblical authors wrote in such a way that they wanted you

1293
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.800
to notice when they repeat stuff.

1294
01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:58.900
They want you to notice when you know, Jesus

1295
01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.100
looks like David.

1296
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.400
Or when Jesus looks like Moses or whatever they want

1297
01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.600
you to see that? Okay. So my encourage you my

1298
01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.900
encouragement for you for next week is if you

1299
01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.200
fallen behind on your yearly reading plan as I

1300
01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.100
have get caught up read the Bible just read it like

1301
01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:19.200
don't feel stressed about it. Just read the thing pay attention

1302
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:19.900
to details.

1303
01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.300
Listen for repeated patterns if there's weird things like, you know.

1304
01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.600
six six winged

1305
01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.400
I covered.

1306
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.200
Monstrosities with swords like you might want to pay attention to

1307
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.000
that. It's weird. That's my encouragement. So here's the

1308
01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.300
deal Genesis wanted to

1309
01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.400
God makes the world for a certain purpose and a

1310
01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.800
certain way God's people in his place rule care be

1311
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.500
fruitful and multiply obey.

1312
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.900
in the fall in Genesis 3

1313
01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.500
it all falls apart.

1314
01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.600
But God's made a promise.

1315
01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.300
That he's going to reverse the curse of Adam. He's going to restore what

1316
01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:02.100
Adam lost through the seed of women and so

1317
01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.300
next week. We'll start our search for the

1318
01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:05.700
seed.
