00:00:03.425 --> 00:00:04.515
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:07.115
We're so glad you are here to worship with us,

3
00:00:07.255 --> 00:00:10.995
and we're gonna begin our time together, uh, by, um,

4
00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:14.155
celebrating with Annie, uh, her baptism

5
00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:15.395
and her community group leader.

6
00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:17.275
Danielle is gonna read her story for us today.

7
00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:20.515
I grew up in a Christian household,

8
00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.355
but I never really wanted to go to church or found it fun.

9
00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.515
Ever since I was little, I have struggled with anger

10
00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:29.195
and growing up with the anger turned into

11
00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.235
mental health problems.

12
00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:32.875
In middle school, my mental health got worse

13
00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.395
and middle school was just rough

14
00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:36.995
and it was rough time without the Lord.

15
00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:40.955
I started struggling a lot with depression and anxiety

16
00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:44.115
and a lot of the time I just didn't want to be alive.

17
00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:48.235
I had tried to end my life one night,

18
00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:50.835
but then I saw my Bible and started crying.

19
00:00:51.675 --> 00:00:52.795
I immediately picked it up

20
00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:55.995
and the first verse I saw was Psalm six, eight through nine.

21
00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:59.275
Those verses were something I really needed to hear

22
00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:00.515
and I started praying.

23
00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:02.555
I asked God to save me.

24
00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:04.995
I felt so much peace after I prayed

25
00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:06.595
and I just sat on the floor crying.

26
00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:08.795
It felt like he was with me.

27
00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:12.435
This summer I went to Canuck and I repented of my sins

28
00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:13.915
and I gave my life to Jesus.

29
00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:17.955
I immediately started crying, not because I was sad, but

30
00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:20.035
because of how happy and relieved I felt.

31
00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.355
And during kids camp, I realized

32
00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:24.355
how much I wasn't really living for the Lord.

33
00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:26.475
So I prayed to really change my ways.

34
00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:29.235
I have decided today to get baptized

35
00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:31.715
to publicly show my love for Jesus to you,

36
00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:32.915
and that he's my Lord.

37
00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:36.195
He has saved me from death to life.

38
00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:43.435
Annie, we're proud of you.

39
00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:47.315
I have seen how the Lord has transformed your life

40
00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:51.075
and we praise God for his work in you.

41
00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:54.435
It's my privilege to baptize you, my sister, in the name

42
00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:56.875
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

43
00:02:00.835 --> 00:02:01.835
Let's worship today.

44
00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:07.745
Let's stand to our.
