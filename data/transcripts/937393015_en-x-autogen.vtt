1
00:00:00.355 --> 00:00:01.165
Good morning church.

2
00:00:01.545 --> 00:00:06.165
It is a joy to be with you guys today. Um, happy 60 years.

3
00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:09.365
What a blessing it is, um, to hear all those stories.

4
00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:11.445
Oh, my name is Brandon. I get

5
00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.205
to serve here at Henderson Hills in the student ministry,

6
00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.005
working with sixth to 12th graders.

7
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:17.725
And it is an absolute ball.

8
00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:21.085
Uh, and also I get to devote some of my time as a resident.

9
00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:24.325
I get to grow in the areas of pastoral ministry

10
00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:25.605
and church planting.

11
00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:27.685
And so I'm super excited about that

12
00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:28.925
and what the future holds.

13
00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:31.445
But if you're new here, I just wanna say welcome.

14
00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.245
This is a very big space.

15
00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:36.645
It can be intimidating at times, but we don't want it to be.

16
00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.845
We want to connect with you, we want to meet you.

17
00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:42.165
And so, uh, after service you, if you want to go out

18
00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:43.845
to the lobby, there is a new here sign.

19
00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:45.445
Uh, we'd love to get connected

20
00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.725
and also come up to the front, uh, for prayer.

21
00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:49.725
And we just love to talk to you.

22
00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:52.205
Uh, but if you have your Bibles, please turn with me

23
00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:53.685
to First Corinthians.

24
00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:58.925
We are going to be in first Corinthians 10 this morning

25
00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:04.915
right after Romans, right

26
00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:06.075
before second Corinthians,

27
00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:08.715
one Corinthians 10 in the New Testament.

28
00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:11.995
So as you're turning there, I just want to give you guys,

29
00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:14.755
uh, a quick summary of what this month has been for us.

30
00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:17.595
It's been a big one in the life of Henderson Hills.

31
00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:20.235
We get to celebrate 60 years as you guys saw,

32
00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:22.675
and as we look back at our history,

33
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:25.275
one thing has been truly evident

34
00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:28.875
and that is God's faithfulness.

35
00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:35.475
Without God, none of us would mean anything.

36
00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:39.665
The truth is, if God doesn't show up,

37
00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:43.935
then we are wasting our time and working in vain.

38
00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:48.175
And God's faithfulness is not an attribute that we came up

39
00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:49.335
with or we discovered,

40
00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:51.735
but it is something that's been revealed to us

41
00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:53.335
through his word.

42
00:01:54.235 --> 00:01:55.935
And we can see it all throughout the Bible,

43
00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:58.015
God's faithfulness.

44
00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:00.745
But what we've done the past couple weeks

45
00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:03.785
is we've honed in on first Corinthians

46
00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:07.525
and we've tried to see all the times.

47
00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:10.925
Paul mentions how God is faithful.

48
00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:13.115
And this morning we get to see

49
00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:15.515
that God is faithful in our temptations.

50
00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:19.395
How encouraging is that?

51
00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:23.855
In our weakest moments when we feel all alone,

52
00:02:24.595 --> 00:02:26.455
God is faithful.

53
00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:31.535
God is faithful to provide a way of escape so

54
00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:33.255
that we can endure it.

55
00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:39.705
And I myself have truly thought sometimes that the only way

56
00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:42.865
to get past this temptation is to give in

57
00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:45.505
and let the enemy win.

58
00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:47.065
But that is not what the Bible teaches.

59
00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:51.165
What the Bible teaches is that we can fight

60
00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.565
and we can win against temptation only

61
00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:57.685
because God is faithful.

62
00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.445
And if God is faithful in our temptations

63
00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:05.245
and he wants to see us endure, here's what this tells me,

64
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:08.405
that God is for you.

65
00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:14.025
God does not want to see sin destroy you.

66
00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:17.215
Do you believe that this morning?

67
00:03:18.195 --> 00:03:19.615
Do you believe in God's faithfulness?

68
00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:23.165
So if you take away one thing

69
00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:24.245
this morning, I want it to be this.

70
00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:28.925
We fight against temptation

71
00:03:30.295 --> 00:03:34.355
by humbling ourselves under the faithfulness of God.

72
00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:38.625
We fight against temptation

73
00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:42.105
by humbling ourselves under the faithfulness of God.

74
00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.345
Let's pray and ask that He would help us believe

75
00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:49.705
that this morning, God, you are good

76
00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:51.225
and God you are faithful.

77
00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:56.055
God, would you help us to understand

78
00:03:56.075 --> 00:03:57.415
who you are through your word?

79
00:03:58.475 --> 00:04:01.535
God, I pray that the word of God falls on good soil

80
00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:04.665
and brings back much fruit.

81
00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:06.225
In your name we pray. Amen.

82
00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:09.545
One Corinthians 10, six through 13 says this.

83
00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:15.785
Now, these things took place as examples for us

84
00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.765
that we might not desire evil as they did,

85
00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:24.885
do not be idolaters as some of them were as it is written

86
00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:29.285
that people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.

87
00:04:30.615 --> 00:04:32.115
We must not indulge in sexual

88
00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:34.235
immorality as some of them did.

89
00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:37.715
And 23,000 fell in a single day.

90
00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:41.085
We must not put Christ to the test as some of them did

91
00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:43.685
and were destroyed by serpents

92
00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:47.065
nor grumble as some of them did

93
00:04:47.445 --> 00:04:49.465
and were destroyed by the destroyer.

94
00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:52.845
Now these things happen to them as an example,

95
00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:54.735
but they're written down

96
00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:58.135
for our instruction on whom the end of ages has come.

97
00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:02.275
Therefore, that anyone who thinks that he,

98
00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:04.475
that he stands take heed lest he fall.

99
00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:08.075
No temptation has overtaken you. That is not common to man.

100
00:05:09.355 --> 00:05:12.095
God is faithful and he will not let you be

101
00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:13.295
tempted beyond your ability.

102
00:05:14.155 --> 00:05:16.855
But with the temptation, he will also provide the way

103
00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:20.375
of escape so that you may be able to endure it.

104
00:05:21.385 --> 00:05:23.765
So this is a fun text and a fun topic to talk about.

105
00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:25.885
I mean, who doesn't love temptation? Right?

106
00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:28.365
Um, and I think it's funny, uh,

107
00:05:28.365 --> 00:05:30.525
and I'm trying to figure out why John would give me

108
00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:31.925
the one about temptation.

109
00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:34.285
Maybe he's trying to send me a message, I'm not sure,

110
00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:36.125
but we can all ask him after this.

111
00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:39.725
Um, but little does John though, that I am actually

112
00:05:40.425 --> 00:05:43.245
an expert when it comes to the temptations.

113
00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:48.245
Um, I know almost every word to my girl

114
00:05:48.665 --> 00:05:50.005
and ain't too proud to beg.

115
00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:54.445
Um, and not only that, my senior year

116
00:05:54.445 --> 00:05:57.205
of high school I took a course, uh, he humanities

117
00:05:57.365 --> 00:05:59.765
where we just studied American culture and history

118
00:06:00.065 --> 00:06:02.445
and the arts and we devoted two weeks

119
00:06:03.345 --> 00:06:05.925
to learning about the Motown crew.

120
00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:08.765
So I guess you could say

121
00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:10.765
that Edna Public School has prepared me

122
00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:12.005
perfectly for this moment.

123
00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:14.565
Go wolves. There we go. Anyone, anyone? There we go.

124
00:06:15.385 --> 00:06:17.085
Uh, but one thing

125
00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.685
that we did learn about the temp temptations is this,

126
00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:22.645
and it feels like the case for every, every band,

127
00:06:22.645 --> 00:06:25.945
every boy band in, in history is

128
00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:26.985
that they eventually broke up

129
00:06:28.045 --> 00:06:29.545
and the temptations were no more.

130
00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:33.355
And one of the reasons why most groups break up is due to,

131
00:06:34.015 --> 00:06:35.595
uh, pride and division.

132
00:06:35.655 --> 00:06:37.315
And one member wants to take it this way.

133
00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:39.035
Another member wants to take it this way

134
00:06:39.535 --> 00:06:43.195
and they just can't seem to reconcile and work together.

135
00:06:45.255 --> 00:06:47.315
And once they realize they can no longer work together

136
00:06:47.315 --> 00:06:50.995
anymore, they split up and the band is over.

137
00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:54.075
What's funny about this is that

138
00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:57.075
if we see something very similar to the lives

139
00:06:57.095 --> 00:07:01.665
of the believers in Corinth, there's division among them

140
00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:05.065
and their division is really rooted in being puffed

141
00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:06.345
up and prideful.

142
00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:09.555
And because Paul knows them so well

143
00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:14.335
and he knows the history of those who have gone

144
00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:16.935
before them, he even knows himself so well.

145
00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.515
Paul gives them a history lesson

146
00:07:21.055 --> 00:07:22.395
and we see that in verse six.

147
00:07:22.495 --> 00:07:25.995
He says, now these things took place as an example, but,

148
00:07:26.055 --> 00:07:29.475
but what are these things to under understand these things?

149
00:07:29.475 --> 00:07:31.475
We have to go back to verses one through five.

150
00:07:32.655 --> 00:07:34.835
And what is Paul doing? He's pointing them back

151
00:07:35.095 --> 00:07:37.315
to Israel In the wilderness,

152
00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:42.175
God freed the people of Israel from the rule of Pharaoh

153
00:07:42.175 --> 00:07:43.215
and he was bringing them

154
00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:46.215
through the wilderness into the promised land.

155
00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:48.335
And this was no ordinary journey,

156
00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:51.255
but it was a journey that will be talked about

157
00:07:51.255 --> 00:07:52.535
for generations to come.

158
00:07:54.805 --> 00:07:58.015
Paul references how they passed through the Red Sea.

159
00:07:58.015 --> 00:08:00.615
They got to witness God parked the Red Sea

160
00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:02.255
and they walked right through it.

161
00:08:04.055 --> 00:08:05.625
Paul mentioned how the people of Israel,

162
00:08:05.695 --> 00:08:07.465
they were hungry and what did God do?

163
00:08:08.165 --> 00:08:12.095
He provided fruit food from the heavens, not just food,

164
00:08:12.095 --> 00:08:14.455
but he also provided water from a rock.

165
00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:17.575
They got to see all these things.

166
00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:20.295
They got to see God show up in really big ways

167
00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:23.695
and yet they were overthrown in the wilderness.

168
00:08:26.165 --> 00:08:29.545
All their needs are provided by God in a supernatural way.

169
00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:32.505
So you would think that these are the people

170
00:08:32.565 --> 00:08:33.745
who can be puffed up

171
00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:36.225
and handle whatever comes their way, right?

172
00:08:37.375 --> 00:08:40.635
But verse five tells us this, nevertheless, with most

173
00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:42.355
of them, God was not pleased.

174
00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:47.115
Why? For they were overthrown in the wilderness.

175
00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:50.715
What does this show us? What does this

176
00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:51.755
show the Corinthians at the time?

177
00:08:53.055 --> 00:08:54.675
Why is Paul referencing the story?

178
00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:59.845
Because Paul wants them to see that temptation is real

179
00:09:00.585 --> 00:09:02.685
and we are not exempt from that.

180
00:09:04.975 --> 00:09:08.765
Temptation is real and we are not exempt.

181
00:09:10.665 --> 00:09:12.935
Temptation came to tho, came to the fathers.

182
00:09:13.755 --> 00:09:15.825
So they need to see that it will come.

183
00:09:15.925 --> 00:09:18.145
It came to those who walk through the red sea

184
00:09:18.285 --> 00:09:21.185
and it will come to them today and it will come to us.

185
00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:23.705
But if it will come to us

186
00:09:24.595 --> 00:09:26.175
and we're called to fight against it,

187
00:09:27.435 --> 00:09:29.365
what exactly is temptation?

188
00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:33.555
Well, God's word shows us this all throughout the Bible.

189
00:09:33.575 --> 00:09:35.395
We see in Matthew four that Jesus

190
00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.595
God in the flesh was tempted himself,

191
00:09:40.045 --> 00:09:43.305
but we also that Jesus was without sin,

192
00:09:44.855 --> 00:09:47.005
which is why he could save us from our sins

193
00:09:47.005 --> 00:09:48.205
by dying for our sins.

194
00:09:48.205 --> 00:09:51.685
So temptation is not sin, we understand that.

195
00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:56.325
But we also see in James chapter one verses 13

196
00:09:56.385 --> 00:09:59.485
and 15, let no one say when he is tempted,

197
00:10:00.665 --> 00:10:01.965
I'm being tempted by God.

198
00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:05.015
For God cannot be tempted with evil

199
00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:07.695
and he himself tempts no one.

200
00:10:08.715 --> 00:10:11.135
But each person is tempted when he is lured

201
00:10:11.135 --> 00:10:12.975
and enticed by his own desire.

202
00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:17.465
Then desire when it has conceived, gives birth to sin.

203
00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:21.545
And sin when it's fully grown, brings forth death.

204
00:10:22.445 --> 00:10:24.305
So temptation is being lured

205
00:10:24.365 --> 00:10:26.385
and enticed by our own desire from within.

206
00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:30.155
And we can't say that God is the one doing the tempting.

207
00:10:30.695 --> 00:10:33.635
One Thessalonians three, five, Paul writes to them, he says,

208
00:10:33.635 --> 00:10:37.515
for this reason when I could bear it no longer I sin

209
00:10:37.515 --> 00:10:40.235
to learn about your faith for fear

210
00:10:40.235 --> 00:10:42.475
that somehow the tempter had tempted you

211
00:10:42.735 --> 00:10:44.195
and our labor would be in vain.

212
00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:48.475
So there is a tempter that is roaming around, desiring

213
00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:52.275
for believers to give in to desires of the flesh

214
00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:54.435
and to destroy themselves.

215
00:10:55.825 --> 00:10:57.685
And the Bible isn't shy to talk about that.

216
00:10:57.905 --> 00:10:59.605
And Paul here in Corinthians wants them

217
00:10:59.605 --> 00:11:01.885
to be on guard and be aware.

218
00:11:03.605 --> 00:11:05.975
Paul wants them to learn from the people of the past,

219
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.565
learn from their mistakes, learn from their examples,

220
00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:12.005
and understand that we are not exempt from that

221
00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:14.765
we will experience temptation

222
00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:17.825
and we need to know what we're up against.

223
00:11:21.005 --> 00:11:25.335
And as I look through this text, I see a lot of commands,

224
00:11:26.095 --> 00:11:27.615
a lot of things not to do.

225
00:11:29.285 --> 00:11:33.705
And I worry verse seven, do not be idol

226
00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:35.145
as some of them were.

227
00:11:36.745 --> 00:11:39.105
I wrestle with the desire inside of me

228
00:11:39.445 --> 00:11:42.585
and I can make idols outta things that are not God.

229
00:11:44.845 --> 00:11:47.235
Verse eight, we must not indulge in sexual immorality.

230
00:11:47.635 --> 00:11:50.235
I wrestle with this with my eyes and my actions.

231
00:11:51.855 --> 00:11:54.045
We must not put Christ to the test.

232
00:11:54.265 --> 00:11:55.765
My fleshly desire

233
00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:57.525
and temptation wants things

234
00:11:58.105 --> 00:11:59.645
to happen the way I want them to happen.

235
00:12:00.985 --> 00:12:03.925
Nor grumble I'm prone to get upset

236
00:12:03.945 --> 00:12:06.005
and to complain when things don't go my way.

237
00:12:08.265 --> 00:12:09.525
And maybe you can relate this morning,

238
00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:14.065
you know the areas you are weak in.

239
00:12:16.585 --> 00:12:19.685
You see the commands laid out in scripture.

240
00:12:21.625 --> 00:12:24.605
You see there is a tempter who wants to entice you

241
00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:28.605
and bring out the desires from within so that you'll give in

242
00:12:28.905 --> 00:12:30.605
and give birth to sin.

243
00:12:32.405 --> 00:12:33.705
And this can be discouraging

244
00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:36.455
because if we are honest with ourselves

245
00:12:37.435 --> 00:12:40.455
and we trust what the Bible says, then we know

246
00:12:40.455 --> 00:12:42.335
that our flesh is weak.

247
00:12:46.145 --> 00:12:48.205
We know our flesh is weak

248
00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:49.845
and we know that from our own experiences

249
00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:53.605
we know that left on our own.

250
00:12:53.705 --> 00:12:56.765
We would constantly, continually give in temptation

251
00:12:56.785 --> 00:12:58.085
and destroy ourselves.

252
00:12:58.265 --> 00:13:03.205
But God is faithful, temptation is real

253
00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:04.365
and we are not exempt

254
00:13:04.585 --> 00:13:06.885
and we are not strong enough to fight it on our own.

255
00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:09.005
But we are not left alone.

256
00:13:09.865 --> 00:13:12.245
We can fight because of God's faithfulness

257
00:13:12.345 --> 00:13:13.725
and his commitment to us.

258
00:13:16.005 --> 00:13:18.025
God wants you to endure temptation

259
00:13:18.045 --> 00:13:20.305
and deny the flesh so

260
00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:23.505
that we might live in the way he designed for us.

261
00:13:25.485 --> 00:13:27.105
So we are not exempt from temptation,

262
00:13:28.055 --> 00:13:31.675
but we are also not exempt from God's faithfulness.

263
00:13:34.035 --> 00:13:37.815
We are not exempt from God's faithfulness. So we have hope.

264
00:13:40.165 --> 00:13:43.905
So what that means is for the father out there

265
00:13:43.965 --> 00:13:45.665
who is tempted to lash out

266
00:13:45.665 --> 00:13:50.545
and yell at his kids, God is faithful in those moments

267
00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:52.945
to help you fight against the flesh

268
00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:57.375
and walk in step with the spirit for the students

269
00:13:57.475 --> 00:13:59.495
who are tempted to idolize themselves

270
00:13:59.515 --> 00:14:02.055
and have a false reality on social media.

271
00:14:03.355 --> 00:14:06.015
God is faithful and he wants you to endure

272
00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:07.735
and flee from temptation.

273
00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:12.535
And the dangers it can lead to for the business owners

274
00:14:12.675 --> 00:14:16.015
and bosses who are wrestling with managing their, their, uh,

275
00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:17.935
managing in unethical ways to keep up

276
00:14:17.935 --> 00:14:19.135
with the ways of the world.

277
00:14:20.755 --> 00:14:23.695
God the Father wants you to know that the way out is by

278
00:14:24.255 --> 00:14:27.295
humbling yourself under his faithfulness.

279
00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:32.795
We are not the ones who pull ourselves out of temptation,

280
00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:38.055
but God is because he is faithful

281
00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.805
and he does not want to see us destroy ourselves,

282
00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:44.685
which leads us to our next point.

283
00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:50.375
Without temptation to temptation can lead to sin,

284
00:14:51.865 --> 00:14:54.335
which will lead to death.

285
00:14:56.675 --> 00:14:58.745
Temptation is not what leads to death,

286
00:14:58.805 --> 00:15:02.105
but giving birth to sin is what will destroy us.

287
00:15:02.105 --> 00:15:03.825
We learned that in in James one

288
00:15:05.275 --> 00:15:07.015
and we can even see it in our text very clearly.

289
00:15:07.015 --> 00:15:08.975
Look with me at verse eight again.

290
00:15:10.595 --> 00:15:13.735
We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did

291
00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:18.255
and 23,000 fell in a single day.

292
00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:24.105
Verse nine, we must not put Christ to test

293
00:15:24.405 --> 00:15:25.825
to the test as some of them did

294
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:30.385
and we're destroyed by serpents verse 10,

295
00:15:30.565 --> 00:15:32.505
nor grumble as some of them did

296
00:15:32.525 --> 00:15:35.345
and were destroyed by the destroyer.

297
00:15:36.485 --> 00:15:39.635
These people did not get to see the promised land

298
00:15:39.735 --> 00:15:42.715
and experience the land flowing with milk and honey

299
00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.355
and they died in the wilderness.

300
00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:48.445
Now some of them walked in faithfulness,

301
00:15:49.345 --> 00:15:51.645
but most of them did not.

302
00:15:51.745 --> 00:15:56.625
And God was not pleased giving into the flesh

303
00:15:56.645 --> 00:15:59.905
and giving birth to sin, separated them from God.

304
00:16:02.255 --> 00:16:04.795
And their stories were now written down as an example of

305
00:16:04.795 --> 00:16:06.155
what not to do.

306
00:16:09.395 --> 00:16:10.655
But we see this all throughout the Bible.

307
00:16:12.465 --> 00:16:14.605
We could go back all the way to Genesis three

308
00:16:14.605 --> 00:16:16.445
and see how this played out from the very beginning.

309
00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:18.085
Genesis three, one through six.

310
00:16:19.575 --> 00:16:21.795
Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast

311
00:16:21.795 --> 00:16:24.035
of the fields that the Lord God had made.

312
00:16:25.745 --> 00:16:28.445
He said to the woman, did God actually say

313
00:16:28.985 --> 00:16:30.565
you shall not eat of any tree in the garden?

314
00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:36.065
And the woman said to the serpent, we may eat of, we may eat

315
00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:38.025
of the fruit of the trees in the garden,

316
00:16:38.485 --> 00:16:40.065
but God said, you shall not eat of the tree.

317
00:16:40.085 --> 00:16:42.425
Eat of the fruit of the tree is in the midst of the garden.

318
00:16:42.425 --> 00:16:43.985
Neither shall you touch it lest you die.

319
00:16:45.325 --> 00:16:49.105
But the serpent said to the woman, you will not surely die

320
00:16:49.805 --> 00:16:51.425
for God knows that when you eat of it,

321
00:16:51.425 --> 00:16:52.465
your eyes will be opened

322
00:16:52.525 --> 00:16:56.015
and you will be like God knowing good and evil.

323
00:16:56.435 --> 00:16:58.495
So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food

324
00:16:58.495 --> 00:17:02.095
and that it was a delight to the eyes that the tree was

325
00:17:02.095 --> 00:17:05.055
to be desired to make one wise, she took

326
00:17:05.055 --> 00:17:06.135
of its fruit and ate.

327
00:17:06.795 --> 00:17:09.135
And she also gave some to her husband who was with her

328
00:17:09.675 --> 00:17:14.495
and he ate the man and the woman gave into into temptation.

329
00:17:14.495 --> 00:17:18.615
And what did it lead to? Separation from God.

330
00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:22.735
And what did it bring? It brought death into the world.

331
00:17:24.595 --> 00:17:25.815
We could look at the story of David,

332
00:17:27.185 --> 00:17:28.605
how he was tempted on the ledge

333
00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:31.605
and he gave into that temptation.

334
00:17:31.605 --> 00:17:33.525
And what did it bring? It brought death

335
00:17:34.115 --> 00:17:35.285
through a generation.

336
00:17:36.695 --> 00:17:39.315
Giving into temptation is destructive.

337
00:17:40.405 --> 00:17:42.545
And there is no one in here who needs to hear

338
00:17:42.545 --> 00:17:46.705
that more than me because I fall into the trap

339
00:17:46.705 --> 00:17:49.105
and think that just because I'm saved by grace

340
00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:52.765
and all my sins have been paid for by the blood of Christ,

341
00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:54.005
I am untouchable.

342
00:17:55.385 --> 00:17:57.565
And it is true and it is good news

343
00:17:57.565 --> 00:18:00.605
that death has no claim on us as believers.

344
00:18:01.035 --> 00:18:04.685
Amen. But when we give into temptation

345
00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:09.765
and sin against God, it still hurts us.

346
00:18:10.865 --> 00:18:15.285
We are hurting our fellowship with God at times.

347
00:18:15.465 --> 00:18:18.245
It can lead to hurting and destroying our own bodies.

348
00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:23.525
Giving in a temptation can lead to hurting those around us

349
00:18:23.545 --> 00:18:25.245
and destroying relationships.

350
00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:29.605
So yes, we are saved and we stand complete,

351
00:18:30.265 --> 00:18:32.845
but we will be foolish to say that giving it a temptation

352
00:18:32.865 --> 00:18:36.325
and sitting against God has no effect on us anymore.

353
00:18:38.435 --> 00:18:40.215
But the most encouraging thing about this text

354
00:18:40.235 --> 00:18:43.095
and topic today is that God is faithful

355
00:18:43.715 --> 00:18:45.215
and he does not want that for us.

356
00:18:45.755 --> 00:18:47.215
He wants the exact opposite.

357
00:18:47.315 --> 00:18:49.815
He wants us to endure temptation.

358
00:18:50.075 --> 00:18:51.655
He wants us to choose him

359
00:18:51.995 --> 00:18:55.335
and his design over our fleshly desires.

360
00:18:57.585 --> 00:19:02.205
And God provides a way of escape a way out of temptation

361
00:19:04.855 --> 00:19:07.835
so we can fight and we can withstand temptation

362
00:19:07.835 --> 00:19:11.955
that comes our way by remembering that he is faithful

363
00:19:12.855 --> 00:19:15.635
and he is for us today.

364
00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.595
Do you believe that today? Amen.

365
00:19:19.615 --> 00:19:21.875
Do you believe that the temptation that you are saying yes

366
00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:25.955
to is actually hurting and um, doing damage to you?

367
00:19:28.175 --> 00:19:30.955
But do you also believe that no temptation is uncommon,

368
00:19:31.825 --> 00:19:35.075
meaning that you are not alone in your struggles?

369
00:19:35.075 --> 00:19:38.155
And do you believe that God provides a way out?

370
00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:40.725
And if we believe this,

371
00:19:41.035 --> 00:19:42.325
then we should listen to the command.

372
00:19:42.345 --> 00:19:46.965
And from Paul in verse 14, he says, therefore my beloved

373
00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:49.565
after everything he's just said,

374
00:19:49.565 --> 00:19:51.685
after knowing that God is faithful, what did he say?

375
00:19:51.685 --> 00:19:55.445
He says, therefore, flee from idolatry.

376
00:19:56.765 --> 00:19:57.935
Flee from sin.

377
00:19:58.515 --> 00:20:00.775
You no longer have to sit in your room alone

378
00:20:00.875 --> 00:20:02.375
and just conce the temptation.

379
00:20:03.195 --> 00:20:06.015
You no longer have to walk into work

380
00:20:06.155 --> 00:20:08.415
and just accept this is the way things are going to be.

381
00:20:09.665 --> 00:20:11.605
You no longer have to scroll through social media

382
00:20:11.705 --> 00:20:13.245
and compare yourself to others.

383
00:20:13.465 --> 00:20:16.205
You can fight against temptation against the desires

384
00:20:16.205 --> 00:20:18.405
of the flesh because of who God is.

385
00:20:20.555 --> 00:20:22.935
But here's a challenge of a text like this.

386
00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:27.085
We can become like the famous Duck church.

387
00:20:27.515 --> 00:20:28.885
Have you guys ever heard of the Duck Church?

388
00:20:29.745 --> 00:20:31.125
Do you mind if I tell you about the duck Church?

389
00:20:31.425 --> 00:20:32.605
Um, so once upon a time

390
00:20:33.145 --> 00:20:36.925
in a remote village called Duck Land, um,

391
00:20:36.925 --> 00:20:40.725
there was a small church, um, called Duck Church

392
00:20:41.145 --> 00:20:43.645
and there were no cars in duck church.

393
00:20:43.905 --> 00:20:45.685
And so, uh, all the ducks,

394
00:20:45.805 --> 00:20:48.045
whenever they wanted to go to church, they all waddled.

395
00:20:48.155 --> 00:20:49.765
They waddled their way to the church.

396
00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.765
And as soon as they got to the church, they'd come in,

397
00:20:52.765 --> 00:20:54.445
they'd greet each other, it'd be an

398
00:20:54.445 --> 00:20:55.485
amazing time of fellowship.

399
00:20:55.485 --> 00:20:57.285
And if they were new here, they'd waddle themselves

400
00:20:57.305 --> 00:20:59.165
to the new here area in the lobby.

401
00:20:59.745 --> 00:21:02.965
Um, but after they greeted one another, they'd come in

402
00:21:03.885 --> 00:21:05.085
sing these worship songs.

403
00:21:05.785 --> 00:21:08.245
Uh, and the duck minister began to preach.

404
00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:12.465
And the duck preaching would say something along the lines

405
00:21:13.085 --> 00:21:18.025
of this ducks, you were born to fly.

406
00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:22.865
God has given you wings to soar like the eagles.

407
00:21:24.285 --> 00:21:27.075
Ducks fly together, fly as high as you can.

408
00:21:28.695 --> 00:21:29.955
And everyone was encouraged.

409
00:21:31.195 --> 00:21:32.795
Everyone would do their quacks, their amens.

410
00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.795
Um, but the truth is once church was over,

411
00:21:36.425 --> 00:21:37.515
they all waddled home.

412
00:21:39.505 --> 00:21:40.835
They all waddled home.

413
00:21:40.895 --> 00:21:43.275
And the truth is, we can come together

414
00:21:43.855 --> 00:21:46.715
and we can hear how we can fight against temptation

415
00:21:46.745 --> 00:21:49.435
because God is faithful and he is for us.

416
00:21:49.615 --> 00:21:51.835
And we can praise him for his faithfulness.

417
00:21:53.415 --> 00:21:55.835
We can thank him that he provides a way of escape.

418
00:21:58.105 --> 00:22:01.285
And then we go back to being oblivious to temptation,

419
00:22:01.865 --> 00:22:05.455
to we go back and try to fight temptation on our own

420
00:22:05.675 --> 00:22:07.255
and we given to sin.

421
00:22:08.435 --> 00:22:09.575
And I don't want that for myself

422
00:22:09.575 --> 00:22:11.815
and I don't want that for us as a collective.

423
00:22:11.875 --> 00:22:14.295
So how are we to escape temptation?

424
00:22:14.365 --> 00:22:16.735
What is the way that God provides?

425
00:22:18.715 --> 00:22:20.135
Now we know that God is sovereign.

426
00:22:21.535 --> 00:22:24.115
It can use many different things for different purposes.

427
00:22:24.975 --> 00:22:27.795
God could usee a phone call from a friend as a way

428
00:22:27.795 --> 00:22:28.835
of escape from temptation.

429
00:22:29.455 --> 00:22:31.155
But what I want us to do is look at three ways

430
00:22:31.155 --> 00:22:32.675
that we see throughout God's word

431
00:22:32.675 --> 00:22:34.795
that he has made a way of escape.

432
00:22:36.755 --> 00:22:38.095
The first one is the Holy Spirit.

433
00:22:39.675 --> 00:22:41.335
In the gospel of John chapters 14

434
00:22:41.335 --> 00:22:43.615
and 16, we see Jesus mention the Holy Spirit

435
00:22:44.515 --> 00:22:47.135
and he tells us that the Holy Spirit is given to us

436
00:22:47.315 --> 00:22:50.135
by God the Father to be with us forever.

437
00:22:51.605 --> 00:22:53.785
And the Spirit serves to teach us all things

438
00:22:53.845 --> 00:22:57.105
and guides us in all things and reveals truth to us.

439
00:22:58.345 --> 00:23:00.925
And for those in here who have put their faith in Jesus,

440
00:23:01.745 --> 00:23:03.605
the spirit of God dwells inside of you.

441
00:23:03.745 --> 00:23:08.105
Now the spirit of God resides in you

442
00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:10.985
to give you strength to flee from temptation

443
00:23:11.005 --> 00:23:12.785
and deny the desires of the flesh.

444
00:23:14.075 --> 00:23:16.975
And this is not our own doing or our own power.

445
00:23:17.045 --> 00:23:18.815
This is God's faithfulness.

446
00:23:20.855 --> 00:23:23.675
So if we want to fight against temptation,

447
00:23:24.455 --> 00:23:28.315
we must humble ourselves under God's faithfulness.

448
00:23:28.415 --> 00:23:29.955
He has given us the spirit of God.

449
00:23:30.025 --> 00:23:32.875
Galatians five 16 and 17 says this,

450
00:23:32.895 --> 00:23:37.675
but I say, walk by the spirit and you'll not gratify.

451
00:23:37.975 --> 00:23:41.525
The desires of the flesh for the desires

452
00:23:41.525 --> 00:23:42.965
of the flesh are against the spirit

453
00:23:43.785 --> 00:23:46.225
and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh

454
00:23:46.605 --> 00:23:48.145
for these are opposed to each other

455
00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:50.985
to keep you from doing the things you want to do.

456
00:23:52.685 --> 00:23:56.335
Walking as the spirit leads is a way of escape

457
00:23:56.845 --> 00:23:58.695
from the desires of the flesh.

458
00:24:00.355 --> 00:24:02.415
Not only is the spirit of God our help,

459
00:24:02.415 --> 00:24:05.255
but also the word of God.

460
00:24:06.285 --> 00:24:08.925
I mentioned earlier in Matthew four how Jesus was able

461
00:24:08.925 --> 00:24:11.725
to withstand temptation, but how was he able to do it?

462
00:24:13.265 --> 00:24:15.685
We see this in Matthew four verses one through four.

463
00:24:16.795 --> 00:24:19.565
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness

464
00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:20.645
to be tempted by the devil.

465
00:24:21.945 --> 00:24:25.525
And after fasting, 40 days and 40 nights, he was hungry.

466
00:24:26.925 --> 00:24:30.105
And the tempter came and said to him, if you are the Son

467
00:24:30.105 --> 00:24:33.025
of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.

468
00:24:33.665 --> 00:24:36.885
But he answered, it is written, man shall not live

469
00:24:36.885 --> 00:24:38.245
by bread alone, but by every word

470
00:24:38.245 --> 00:24:39.845
that comes from the mouth of God.

471
00:24:40.585 --> 00:24:43.735
How did he respond? It is ridden.

472
00:24:44.115 --> 00:24:47.535
He fought against the lies of the enemy with the truths

473
00:24:47.595 --> 00:24:48.695
of the Father.

474
00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:51.995
And he was tempted two more times in this text

475
00:24:52.095 --> 00:24:53.875
and he responds the same way each time.

476
00:24:54.615 --> 00:24:56.675
And we learned this from Psalm 119.

477
00:24:57.415 --> 00:24:59.195
How can a young man keep his way pure

478
00:25:00.335 --> 00:25:03.595
by guarding it according to your word?

479
00:25:04.885 --> 00:25:06.815
With my whole heart, I seek you.

480
00:25:07.795 --> 00:25:09.615
Let me not wander from your commandments.

481
00:25:09.775 --> 00:25:13.175
I have stored up your word in my heart

482
00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:15.455
that I might not sin against you.

483
00:25:16.845 --> 00:25:18.505
So are you making a practice

484
00:25:18.505 --> 00:25:21.105
to write God's word on your heart art?

485
00:25:23.775 --> 00:25:25.395
Do you know his word

486
00:25:25.455 --> 00:25:27.995
and the truths that are found in it so

487
00:25:28.025 --> 00:25:31.475
that you can combat the lives of the enemy?

488
00:25:33.515 --> 00:25:36.615
So we see the spirit of God. We see the word of God.

489
00:25:36.845 --> 00:25:41.015
What else? Prayer. Praying to God.

490
00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:44.215
We know that in Matthew six, in the Sermon on the Mount,

491
00:25:44.225 --> 00:25:46.375
Jesus tells us how to pray.

492
00:25:46.375 --> 00:25:49.865
He teaches us to pray against temptation.

493
00:25:51.055 --> 00:25:54.195
And in Hebrews, we see that Jesus is our great high priest.

494
00:25:54.895 --> 00:25:56.715
And because he is, he's able to sympathize

495
00:25:56.715 --> 00:25:57.955
with us in our weaknesses

496
00:25:57.955 --> 00:26:00.875
because he was tempted just like we are tempted,

497
00:26:01.095 --> 00:26:02.715
yet he was without sin.

498
00:26:04.015 --> 00:26:06.315
So because of that, we can draw near to him

499
00:26:06.905 --> 00:26:09.515
with confidence in our time of need

500
00:26:09.575 --> 00:26:11.035
and our time of weakness.

501
00:26:11.775 --> 00:26:14.195
And so when you are fighting against the desires

502
00:26:14.195 --> 00:26:16.875
of the flesh, you can draw near to God

503
00:26:17.015 --> 00:26:19.235
and pray for deliverance.

504
00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:22.985
Here's what I want us to see through all those.

505
00:26:24.495 --> 00:26:27.595
At the root of all these ways of escape is God himself.

506
00:26:29.225 --> 00:26:32.005
God is so faithful to provide a way of endurance

507
00:26:32.275 --> 00:26:37.155
that he has made himself the way God is for you.

508
00:26:37.295 --> 00:26:39.355
In this fight, God is faithful

509
00:26:39.455 --> 00:26:40.995
and we need to humble ourselves

510
00:26:41.695 --> 00:26:45.085
and be reminded that he is the way of escape.

511
00:26:46.585 --> 00:26:48.605
He is our hope and he is our defense.

512
00:26:48.705 --> 00:26:50.805
He is our escape from the evil one.

513
00:26:51.725 --> 00:26:54.385
And this just reminds me of the song, Lord, I need you.

514
00:26:55.445 --> 00:26:57.745
It says, so teach my song to rise to you

515
00:26:58.655 --> 00:27:00.665
when temptation comes my way,

516
00:27:02.025 --> 00:27:05.605
and when I cannot stand, I will fall on you.

517
00:27:06.695 --> 00:27:09.205
Jesus, you are my hope and stay.

518
00:27:10.065 --> 00:27:13.365
And later on my one defense, my righteousness,

519
00:27:13.825 --> 00:27:15.245
oh God, how I need you.

520
00:27:16.315 --> 00:27:18.415
God is faithful in our temptations

521
00:27:21.445 --> 00:27:23.905
so we can leave here ready to fight

522
00:27:24.925 --> 00:27:28.345
by relying on God, relying on his spirit,

523
00:27:28.375 --> 00:27:29.585
relying on his word,

524
00:27:29.725 --> 00:27:33.145
and relying on prayer, praying for help.

525
00:27:35.695 --> 00:27:38.035
But even though we have the tools

526
00:27:38.655 --> 00:27:39.835
and the resources

527
00:27:39.895 --> 00:27:43.265
to fight against temptation, we still struggle.

528
00:27:44.785 --> 00:27:47.145
I still struggle. I still give a temptation

529
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:50.385
and sin against God who has made himself the way of escape.

530
00:27:52.245 --> 00:27:55.945
Our track record against temptation is not in our favor.

531
00:27:57.965 --> 00:27:59.705
So what can help us in this fight?

532
00:27:59.705 --> 00:28:02.675
Knowing that we need to be reminded

533
00:28:02.675 --> 00:28:04.835
that temptation did not overtake Jesus.

534
00:28:05.465 --> 00:28:08.785
Amen. Temptation did not overtake Jesus.

535
00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:11.785
And so we need to look two places for hope.

536
00:28:13.445 --> 00:28:16.235
First, where were the people overthrown?

537
00:28:16.525 --> 00:28:19.355
Where did they fall into temptation? Look at verse five.

538
00:28:21.875 --> 00:28:25.085
They were overthrown in the wilderness.

539
00:28:27.135 --> 00:28:29.565
Where did Jesus withstand temptation?

540
00:28:30.065 --> 00:28:33.405
In Matthew four in the wilderness,

541
00:28:33.975 --> 00:28:36.365
Jesus is reversing the curse.

542
00:28:37.545 --> 00:28:38.565
So look to the wilderness.

543
00:28:38.565 --> 00:28:40.125
Look at what Jesus did on our behalf,

544
00:28:40.145 --> 00:28:42.885
but also look to the cross.

545
00:28:44.685 --> 00:28:47.475
Jesus, the one who never fell into temptation,

546
00:28:48.065 --> 00:28:51.435
died on the cross for people who constantly fall

547
00:28:51.975 --> 00:28:53.035
and he saved us.

548
00:28:53.815 --> 00:28:55.995
He gave us a new life by his blood.

549
00:28:57.025 --> 00:28:58.955
Even though we struggle with temptation

550
00:28:59.215 --> 00:29:02.115
and it can be hard, we need to focus our eyes on

551
00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:04.075
what has already been done on our behalf.

552
00:29:05.455 --> 00:29:07.715
God is faithful in the midst of temptation

553
00:29:08.415 --> 00:29:10.795
and he's faithful on the other side of temptation

554
00:29:10.795 --> 00:29:13.475
because Christ has reconciled us to him.

555
00:29:14.535 --> 00:29:18.245
Do you believe that today? And if you have not

556
00:29:18.425 --> 00:29:20.805
yet trusted in Jesus, I want you to see this,

557
00:29:21.775 --> 00:29:24.465
that at the heart of his faithfulness is his love.

558
00:29:26.025 --> 00:29:28.885
We serve a God who loves us so much

559
00:29:28.885 --> 00:29:31.925
that he is faithful even in our temptations.

560
00:29:32.625 --> 00:29:36.285
And I want to invite you to explore that, to come talk

561
00:29:36.285 --> 00:29:37.525
to us about what that means.

562
00:29:38.395 --> 00:29:40.525
That God himself will be faithful

563
00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:42.565
To faithless people.

564
00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:44.845
But if you are a believer

565
00:29:45.505 --> 00:29:49.755
and you have trusted in Jesus Christ, fight

566
00:29:49.895 --> 00:29:51.875
and flee from temptation, fight

567
00:29:51.895 --> 00:29:55.255
and flee from sin, not in your own strength,

568
00:29:56.105 --> 00:30:00.445
but by the strength of God, by his way of escape,

569
00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:04.765
trust in his faithfulness, even in temptation,

570
00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:09.105
one Corinthians 10, six through 13.

571
00:30:10.235 --> 00:30:12.615
Now these things took place as examples for us

572
00:30:13.525 --> 00:30:16.055
that we might not desire evil as they did,

573
00:30:17.755 --> 00:30:20.735
do not be idolatry as some of them were as it is written,

574
00:30:21.695 --> 00:30:24.185
that people sat down to eat and to drink

575
00:30:24.245 --> 00:30:25.385
and rose up to play.

576
00:30:26.495 --> 00:30:29.675
We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some

577
00:30:29.675 --> 00:30:33.545
of them did, and 23,000 fell in a single day.

578
00:30:34.755 --> 00:30:36.855
We must not put Christ to the test as some of them did

579
00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:39.255
and were destroyed by serpents

580
00:30:40.665 --> 00:30:42.085
nor grumble as some of them did

581
00:30:42.085 --> 00:30:43.685
and were destroyed by the destroyer.

582
00:30:44.715 --> 00:30:46.975
Now these things happen to them as an example,

583
00:30:47.715 --> 00:30:48.775
but they were written down

584
00:30:48.875 --> 00:30:51.975
for our instruction on whom the end of ages has come.

585
00:30:52.805 --> 00:30:55.335
Therefore, let anyone who thinks that he stands

586
00:30:55.925 --> 00:30:57.215
take heed Les he fall.

587
00:30:58.695 --> 00:31:02.275
No temptation has overtaken you. That is not common to man.

588
00:31:03.495 --> 00:31:07.275
God is faithful and he will not let you be tempted

589
00:31:07.275 --> 00:31:08.275
beyond your ability.

590
00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:11.955
But with the temptation, he will also provide the way

591
00:31:12.095 --> 00:31:15.315
of escape that you may be able to endure it.
