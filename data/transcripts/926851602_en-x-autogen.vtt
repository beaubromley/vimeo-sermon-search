1
00:00:00.945 --> 00:00:03.365
Who do you say that Jesus is?

2
00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:08.285
Who do you say Jesus is?

3
00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:11.895
I'm sure if we went over to the mall

4
00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:13.615
or went into the classrooms of Edmond

5
00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:15.495
and we asked that question, we would get all kinds

6
00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:16.495
of different answers.

7
00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:20.775
We'd get questions or answers like, he's a a good man,

8
00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:23.695
he was a prophet, or he was a good teacher,

9
00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:28.215
or he was a visionary like MLK to, uh, bring reconciliation.

10
00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:29.375
That's, that's what he was.

11
00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:33.175
Well, Jesus also asked his followers

12
00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:38.015
what other people said about him in Matthew 16,

13
00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:39.575
and they responded with a few things.

14
00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:41.735
They said, well, some say you're John the Baptist.

15
00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:43.175
Some say you're Elijah.

16
00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:44.375
Some say you're Jeremiah,

17
00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:45.855
or some say you're one of the prophets.

18
00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:49.655
In other words, they said, there's a variety of opinions

19
00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:51.495
and views on you Jesus.

20
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.455
Some would be more Messiah focused

21
00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:57.135
and some would be less, more worldly focused.

22
00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:01.295
But then Jesus flipped it on his disciples

23
00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.655
and he said this in verse 15.

24
00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:06.575
He said, okay, but who do you say that I am?

25
00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:11.275
Alright, what do, what do people say about me?

26
00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:14.835
Okay, this what, but, but, but who do you say I am?

27
00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:18.435
He wanted to know their perspective,

28
00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:22.125
where their hearts actually were.

29
00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.805
Listen, he's gonna do the same thing for us today.

30
00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:32.325
Each one of us here today, he's going to show us

31
00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:34.685
and ask us that question on this Palm Sunday.

32
00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:36.885
As we study Jesus entering Jerusalem

33
00:01:36.885 --> 00:01:40.445
before his crucifixion, he's going to ask us

34
00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:41.925
that same question.

35
00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:45.845
Who do you say that I am?

36
00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:51.005
And our answer to that question makes

37
00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:53.525
all the difference in the world.

38
00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:58.505
And so we're gonna be in John chapter 12 to see this.

39
00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:01.585
And so take your copy of God's word and turn there with me.

40
00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:03.865
If you don't have one, you can use your device

41
00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:06.465
or there's a Bible around you underneath the seats,

42
00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:11.705
the gospel according to John chapter 12.

43
00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:13.705
If you're unfamiliar with the Bible,

44
00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:16.465
that chapter number is the big number when you get into

45
00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:18.185
John, John 12.

46
00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:19.985
And then we're gonna start in verse 12,

47
00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:24.865
which is the little 12 underneath that one, John 1212.

48
00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:26.225
By the way, if you're new to our church,

49
00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:27.905
my name's John, one of the pastors here.

50
00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:30.985
Uh, it's an honor to get to preach most of the times,

51
00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:33.185
thankful you choose to gather with us today.

52
00:02:33.225 --> 00:02:35.465
I know it's a big deal, so we'd love to meet you.

53
00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:39.025
Come say hi to us either at the front after we're done

54
00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:40.665
or in the lobby out there.

55
00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:45.065
Uh, we'd love to meet you, but let me read our passage today

56
00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:47.025
and then I'm gonna pray again.

57
00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:50.105
John. 12, 12, down through 19,

58
00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:55.215
the next day, the large crowd that had come

59
00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:58.575
to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.

60
00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:01.125
So they took branches of palm trees

61
00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:04.325
and went out to meet him, crying out Hosanna.

62
00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:07.765
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,

63
00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:09.405
even the King of Israel.

64
00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:12.465
And Jesus found a young donkey

65
00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:14.945
and sat on it just as it is written, fear,

66
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:16.145
not daughter of Zion.

67
00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:19.545
Behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's.

68
00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:23.235
Colt, his disciples did not understand

69
00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:24.275
these things at first.

70
00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:28.435
But when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered

71
00:03:28.435 --> 00:03:29.915
that these things had been written about him

72
00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:31.035
and had been done to him.

73
00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:35.435
The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out

74
00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:37.075
of the tomb and raised him from the dead,

75
00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:38.675
continued to bear witness.

76
00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:42.115
And the reason why the crowd went to meet him was

77
00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:44.515
that they'd heard he had done this sign.

78
00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:49.915
So the Pharisees said to one another, you see

79
00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:51.035
that you're gaining nothing.

80
00:03:51.985 --> 00:03:54.835
Look, the world has gone after him.

81
00:03:56.725 --> 00:04:00.375
Lord, we pray as we look at this often familiar

82
00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:04.335
scene in the life of Jesus, we pray

83
00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:06.775
that you'd give us different eyes to see it,

84
00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:09.175
that our hearts would be opened.

85
00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:14.135
Our minds would be enlightened to understand

86
00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:16.735
what you, holy Spirit, have to teach us

87
00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:18.175
through your word today.

88
00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:23.685
Make it clear. Challenge us, encourage us,

89
00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:25.445
spur us on to love

90
00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:30.185
and good deeds that we would be doers of the word,

91
00:04:30.405 --> 00:04:34.425
not hearers only make us good soil in our hearts for that

92
00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:37.025
to bear good fruit through in Jesus' name.

93
00:04:38.385 --> 00:04:42.285
Amen. So instead of calling this passage,

94
00:04:42.435 --> 00:04:45.125
what is typically called the triumphal entry,

95
00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:49.965
I'm referring it to today as the misunderstood entry

96
00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:54.515
and asking the question, who do we see Jesus to be here?

97
00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:59.655
And remember John, he recorded everything in his gospel.

98
00:04:59.805 --> 00:05:02.695
John 2031 says that, that you may believe

99
00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:05.975
that Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, the Savior,

100
00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:08.375
the promised one of old.

101
00:05:08.395 --> 00:05:11.655
And so he recorded this section for that purpose.

102
00:05:11.835 --> 00:05:14.135
And here he recorded this same event,

103
00:05:14.235 --> 00:05:16.575
but he gave us some different perspectives on it.

104
00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:18.815
You see that in fact,

105
00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:20.615
there's four different perspectives we're gonna get

106
00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:23.655
to see on the same event that John records.

107
00:05:25.435 --> 00:05:28.095
And so first we're gonna look at how the crowds saw Jesus.

108
00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:33.255
You see it here. How did the crowds see Jesus?

109
00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:38.655
So there's these people, these common religious people

110
00:05:38.795 --> 00:05:40.135
who were yelling and cheering

111
00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:41.855
and they were, they were in Jerusalem

112
00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:45.575
for this Passover festival, which was the biggest festival,

113
00:05:45.775 --> 00:05:47.655
a big deal in Jerusalem, in Israel.

114
00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:50.655
All the people were gathering there for this season.

115
00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:54.905
But as they gathered, they'd heard about this Jesus God.

116
00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:57.065
He had a reputation by now.

117
00:05:57.265 --> 00:05:59.325
He had been known in certain ways.

118
00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:01.205
And so they were, they were

119
00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:02.605
there and they'd heard about him.

120
00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.325
And many of them were just looking

121
00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:07.685
for his next miracle 'cause, right?

122
00:06:07.685 --> 00:06:10.645
He he, he says, John says that they had seen

123
00:06:10.645 --> 00:06:13.165
and heard about Lazarus being raised from the dead.

124
00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:14.965
They'd heard about Jesus doing that

125
00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:17.845
and they were amazed that he could even do that.

126
00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:22.865
In fact, just ahead of this, in verse nine says,

127
00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:24.865
when the large crowd of the Jews learned

128
00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:27.945
that Jesus was there, they came not only on account of him,

129
00:06:27.965 --> 00:06:30.545
but also to see Lazarus whom he'd raised from the dead.

130
00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:34.465
Like, I wanna see that right? This guy was dead.

131
00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:36.345
Now he is alive. I wanna see who that is

132
00:06:36.345 --> 00:06:40.825
and hear the story even further than that.

133
00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:44.225
Some of these were probably in the crowd

134
00:06:44.895 --> 00:06:47.945
back in John six when Jesus fed the 5,000

135
00:06:47.945 --> 00:06:49.105
with a Hebrew happy meal.

136
00:06:49.405 --> 00:06:52.225
And he took it and he broke it and he fed that many people.

137
00:06:52.325 --> 00:06:54.185
And so they're like, this is amazing

138
00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:57.265
how he could even do that.

139
00:06:57.365 --> 00:06:59.345
But now here they wanted more.

140
00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:01.865
You see it in that scene in John six,

141
00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:04.105
you see it throughout his life, they were looking

142
00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:08.065
for another sign looking for more.

143
00:07:09.905 --> 00:07:11.835
They were looking for the sensational.

144
00:07:14.255 --> 00:07:16.265
They wanted to be drawn into something

145
00:07:16.855 --> 00:07:18.625
extraordinary, something amazing.

146
00:07:22.015 --> 00:07:26.345
The problem is, when you take that to its extent,

147
00:07:26.765 --> 00:07:31.345
we cannot base our faith merely on its production value,

148
00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:35.375
on the exceptional, the sensational.

149
00:07:35.515 --> 00:07:37.935
We know God does miracles. He still does.

150
00:07:38.035 --> 00:07:40.575
And and we know God cares for the least of these.

151
00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:43.175
And he provides, yes, he does that,

152
00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:47.715
but it, when it becomes about the show instead

153
00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:49.915
of about Christ, we've missed it.

154
00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:56.765
Our faith cannot be based merely on the sensational.

155
00:07:58.205 --> 00:07:59.585
It cannot be based merely on

156
00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:04.185
what I feel like the experiential part of what we long for.

157
00:08:05.155 --> 00:08:07.885
Because then if God chooses not to do a miracle,

158
00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:09.685
or if we don't get that feeling,

159
00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:12.005
then our foundation is pretty shaken.

160
00:08:14.805 --> 00:08:18.425
That's why it's not based on feelings, it's based on faith.

161
00:08:22.245 --> 00:08:24.305
But there were others in the crowd, not just looking

162
00:08:24.325 --> 00:08:25.705
for a sensational miracle.

163
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:29.065
There were others who were looking for a conquering king.

164
00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:32.225
They were looking for something military

165
00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:34.545
or something political, the government

166
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:37.305
to be taken over again from what it was.

167
00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:39.865
That's the language they actually used here.

168
00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:42.655
Maybe you've been in church before

169
00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:43.655
and you see the kids coming

170
00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:45.375
and throwing palm branches on the aisle

171
00:08:45.435 --> 00:08:46.495
and that kind of thing and

172
00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:49.055
and they're shouting a a phrase, a word,

173
00:08:50.245 --> 00:08:51.825
hosanna, right?

174
00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:54.465
You see it here, hosanna, that

175
00:08:55.745 --> 00:08:59.715
That word in the original language means save us, I pray.

176
00:09:00.805 --> 00:09:04.325
Save us. Now, in fact,

177
00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:10.435
this is an almost identical quote from Psalm 118,

178
00:09:11.995 --> 00:09:14.485
that these people who are wanting a new king

179
00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:17.485
to save us from the Roman oppression,

180
00:09:18.615 --> 00:09:20.545
they're quoting Psalm one 18

181
00:09:20.645 --> 00:09:23.145
and they're saying it nearly exactly.

182
00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:28.305
Listen to this, save us, we pray, oh Lord, Hosanna.

183
00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:31.865
Oh Lord, we pray, give us success.

184
00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:34.665
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

185
00:09:35.765 --> 00:09:38.665
We bless you from the house of the Lord.

186
00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:40.385
Does that not sound exactly like

187
00:09:40.385 --> 00:09:42.705
what they were saying in John 12?

188
00:09:43.775 --> 00:09:45.915
Nearly word for word. They're quoting that.

189
00:09:45.915 --> 00:09:47.355
And so they, they were speaking truth.

190
00:09:47.585 --> 00:09:49.715
They were crying out for something.

191
00:09:49.715 --> 00:09:51.875
They were looking for the Messiah to come, the one

192
00:09:51.875 --> 00:09:54.075
that God had promised to save his people.

193
00:09:54.415 --> 00:09:55.955
And they saw a lot of it in Jesus.

194
00:09:56.145 --> 00:09:57.995
They were saying, man, this might be the one.

195
00:10:00.885 --> 00:10:02.825
But they were reading things into the

196
00:10:02.845 --> 00:10:04.265
Old Testament that weren't there.

197
00:10:06.785 --> 00:10:09.245
See, what they were looking for is they, they, they failed

198
00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:12.085
to see this as they were looking for something else.

199
00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:14.845
They failed to see that the Messiah's kingdom would not

200
00:10:15.155 --> 00:10:17.645
primarily be of this Earth.

201
00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:22.855
It would have implications as the kingdom of God comes.

202
00:10:23.035 --> 00:10:25.255
Yes, there's tangible implications, but first

203
00:10:25.355 --> 00:10:28.415
and foremost, God's kingdom is a spiritual kingdom.

204
00:10:31.585 --> 00:10:35.285
And so this crowd, some were looking for the sensational,

205
00:10:35.285 --> 00:10:37.245
some were looking for a political deliverer

206
00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:39.525
to come throw out the Romans,

207
00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:43.785
but, but you remember what happened next.

208
00:10:46.155 --> 00:10:48.255
Now, we don't know if it's the same people,

209
00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:51.735
but a few days later from this scene,

210
00:10:53.555 --> 00:10:57.345
another crowd, instead of cheering for Jesus,

211
00:10:58.585 --> 00:11:00.035
they call out, crucify him.

212
00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:06.845
They didn't get what they were wanting

213
00:11:07.705 --> 00:11:10.245
or they didn't like what he was offering.

214
00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:13.285
And so they turned on him.

215
00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:19.055
Listen, that is instructive for all of us,

216
00:11:20.685 --> 00:11:23.095
that when people don't get what their flesh craves,

217
00:11:23.095 --> 00:11:24.415
they turn on you real fast.

218
00:11:27.555 --> 00:11:29.335
So these people, these crowds, they were,

219
00:11:29.645 --> 00:11:33.055
they were at least some of them in the crowd coming to Jesus

220
00:11:33.245 --> 00:11:38.065
with their own agenda, their own desires.

221
00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:40.265
They were wanting something from him

222
00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:41.905
that he was not going to give them.

223
00:11:46.735 --> 00:11:48.635
May some of us be doing the same thing today.

224
00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:54.715
Maybe it's for money.

225
00:11:55.335 --> 00:11:57.195
And you've heard that if you do the right things,

226
00:11:57.245 --> 00:11:58.635
he'll bless you financially.

227
00:12:00.505 --> 00:12:02.405
Or maybe it's wanting a miracle.

228
00:12:04.075 --> 00:12:06.415
You're trying to do this bartering thing with God.

229
00:12:06.555 --> 00:12:07.615
Or maybe you just say, man,

230
00:12:07.615 --> 00:12:08.695
this is gonna gimme a better life,

231
00:12:08.715 --> 00:12:10.375
or this is gonna increase my reputation

232
00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:12.215
and I'm coming to Jesus 'cause this is what I need

233
00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:15.815
for my career or whatever else it may be for you.

234
00:12:18.975 --> 00:12:23.075
We must come to Jesus on his terms, not on our terms.

235
00:12:26.095 --> 00:12:30.415
It'll come up again later. But that's the crowds.

236
00:12:32.265 --> 00:12:34.845
That's how the crowds saw Jesus.

237
00:12:35.025 --> 00:12:38.125
But second, look at how the disciples saw Jesus.

238
00:12:40.595 --> 00:12:41.895
Here's the second perspective.

239
00:12:42.035 --> 00:12:44.255
The disciples, how did they see Jesus?

240
00:12:46.595 --> 00:12:47.855
We see it in verse 16.

241
00:12:49.475 --> 00:12:52.135
His disciples did not understand these things at first.

242
00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:54.055
But when Jesus was glorified,

243
00:12:54.055 --> 00:12:57.095
meaning when Jesus was raised from the dead

244
00:12:57.155 --> 00:12:59.895
and he ascended back to heaven, then they remembered

245
00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:01.855
that these things had been written about him

246
00:13:01.955 --> 00:13:04.015
and had been done to him.

247
00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:07.405
Now, let's remember the context here.

248
00:13:07.815 --> 00:13:11.245
These disciples that John's talking about had been with,

249
00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:16.005
lived with Jesus for nearly three years and they'd seen him

250
00:13:16.185 --> 00:13:20.725
and heard him do so much of this exact thing.

251
00:13:22.255 --> 00:13:23.475
Yet they often didn't get it.

252
00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.525
He said, I'm going to be crucified

253
00:13:27.545 --> 00:13:28.645
and I'm going to resurrect.

254
00:13:28.645 --> 00:13:29.805
And they're still like, what?

255
00:13:32.455 --> 00:13:37.225
Like Peter, when he was asked in Matthew 16,

256
00:13:37.225 --> 00:13:39.305
Jesus said, who do you say that I am?

257
00:13:39.305 --> 00:13:41.665
Right? Peter responded perfectly.

258
00:13:42.285 --> 00:13:43.785
He got it right a hundred percent.

259
00:13:44.285 --> 00:13:46.425
He said, you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

260
00:13:49.025 --> 00:13:53.525
But then just a few verses later, Peter rebukes Jesus,

261
00:13:53.795 --> 00:13:55.845
when Jesus talks about dying on the cross

262
00:13:56.745 --> 00:13:58.205
and Jesus turns to him

263
00:13:58.425 --> 00:14:02.015
and calls him Satan, which by the way, you don't want

264
00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:03.215
that written about you in the Bible.

265
00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:09.745
Also side note, that's a great reason

266
00:14:10.045 --> 00:14:11.785
for the Bible's authenticity.

267
00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:13.585
'cause don't you think Peter

268
00:14:13.585 --> 00:14:14.745
would've wanted that one edited out?

269
00:14:16.575 --> 00:14:17.945
Like Peter would've been over here?

270
00:14:17.945 --> 00:14:21.465
Like, excuse me, guys, erase that real quick.

271
00:14:23.855 --> 00:14:26.925
Satan, right? That's a terrible nickname to have.

272
00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:29.925
But that's what he did.

273
00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:32.925
And so the disciples often didn't get it.

274
00:14:34.945 --> 00:14:37.165
But isn't that strangely some kind of encouragement

275
00:14:37.165 --> 00:14:38.285
to us today?

276
00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:44.175
Like we can often paint the picture that to be a Christian

277
00:14:44.235 --> 00:14:47.335
or to be in church, then you have to know it all.

278
00:14:47.635 --> 00:14:49.215
You can never doubt anything.

279
00:14:49.635 --> 00:14:51.485
You have to have it all together, right?

280
00:14:52.075 --> 00:14:53.085
This passage,

281
00:14:53.955 --> 00:14:56.685
Peter's story flies in the face of that, doesn't it?

282
00:15:00.175 --> 00:15:03.745
Like there's another scene in Mark nine when the man comes

283
00:15:03.745 --> 00:15:06.345
to Jesus and asks Jesus to heal his child.

284
00:15:08.765 --> 00:15:09.945
And Jesus says, well, all things

285
00:15:09.945 --> 00:15:11.105
are possible for those who believe.

286
00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:12.385
And the man says it this way.

287
00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:15.905
He says, I believe Jesus help my unbelief.

288
00:15:18.345 --> 00:15:20.435
Like Jesus, I I know you can,

289
00:15:20.695 --> 00:15:22.755
but boy, there's times I really doubt that.

290
00:15:24.655 --> 00:15:26.675
And I don't know. It sure seems like it's

291
00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:28.675
impossible, but I know you can.

292
00:15:29.015 --> 00:15:30.835
Ah, don't we feel like that?

293
00:15:34.135 --> 00:15:36.155
So when we doubt, when we don't know it all,

294
00:15:36.155 --> 00:15:39.555
when we question, we can run to Jesus in it.

295
00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:43.345
Because he's not casting Peter out.

296
00:15:44.905 --> 00:15:49.165
He won't cast us away either, but, but see it again.

297
00:15:49.225 --> 00:15:52.485
The disciples, his closest disciples, even those

298
00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:56.285
who started the church, didn't get it.

299
00:15:57.405 --> 00:16:00.885
Still needed help. So what help did Jesus give him?

300
00:16:02.855 --> 00:16:04.625
Well, it says, when he was glorified.

301
00:16:04.685 --> 00:16:06.305
So after his resurrection

302
00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:10.225
and his ascension, he gave the Holy Spirit to them,

303
00:16:10.575 --> 00:16:12.905
gave God's spirit, the third person of the Trinity.

304
00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:16.345
He gave them his spirit, which by the way,

305
00:16:16.345 --> 00:16:19.665
he predicted would happen just a few chapters later,

306
00:16:19.735 --> 00:16:21.185
John 1426.

307
00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:24.145
He says, but the helper, the Holy Spirit,

308
00:16:24.575 --> 00:16:26.865
whom the Father will send in my name,

309
00:16:27.165 --> 00:16:28.905
he will teach you all things

310
00:16:29.325 --> 00:16:31.545
and bring to your remembrance all that I've said to you.

311
00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:34.505
He says, I know you don't get it yet,

312
00:16:35.605 --> 00:16:37.705
but I'm gonna send you a helper.

313
00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:38.985
I'm not gonna leave you alone.

314
00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:42.945
I have to leave, but I'm gonna send my Holy Spirit

315
00:16:43.245 --> 00:16:46.065
to correctly bring to mind all the things

316
00:16:46.065 --> 00:16:48.505
that I'd taught you, all the things I've shown you.

317
00:16:48.685 --> 00:16:49.985
He says, I want you to get it.

318
00:16:50.565 --> 00:16:52.905
Here's how I'm going to help you get it.

319
00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:55.975
They still had natural minds,

320
00:16:56.045 --> 00:16:58.295
even at this point in the story, John 12,

321
00:16:58.305 --> 00:17:01.015
Jesus entering Jerusalem, they still had natural minds.

322
00:17:01.015 --> 00:17:02.895
They often couldn't understand spiritual things,

323
00:17:04.365 --> 00:17:07.915
which is why Jesus told Nicodemus in John three,

324
00:17:08.535 --> 00:17:09.835
he said, you must be born again.

325
00:17:10.735 --> 00:17:13.085
He says, you must have a new mind.

326
00:17:14.475 --> 00:17:16.485
Your natural mind isn't gonna get it very often,

327
00:17:16.865 --> 00:17:19.925
but your spiritual mind that you get reborn with,

328
00:17:20.905 --> 00:17:24.125
that's when you'll finally get the understanding.

329
00:17:26.535 --> 00:17:29.115
And so for these disciples, it wasn't until after the death

330
00:17:29.115 --> 00:17:31.195
and resurrection, after receiving the Holy Spirits,

331
00:17:31.195 --> 00:17:32.635
they look back at stuff like this

332
00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.995
and they're like, how did we miss that?

333
00:17:36.595 --> 00:17:40.095
We fully and finally understand, Jesus is the king now. Yes.

334
00:17:40.715 --> 00:17:44.685
But before all that, they were still pretty unclear.

335
00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:47.885
And so, so that's an encouragement and a challenge for us.

336
00:17:49.265 --> 00:17:52.855
We're still gonna misunderstand in our own fleshly minds

337
00:17:53.755 --> 00:17:56.215
if we try to lean on our own understanding, we are going

338
00:17:56.235 --> 00:17:59.255
to never grasp the deeper things of God.

339
00:18:01.745 --> 00:18:04.205
But when we abide in Jesus, when we have

340
00:18:05.005 --> 00:18:07.925
received the Holy Spirit by faith in Christ,

341
00:18:09.315 --> 00:18:12.175
that's when things start to to make sense.

342
00:18:13.075 --> 00:18:15.415
You start to see, now we're not gonna understand everything

343
00:18:15.415 --> 00:18:16.855
because God is God and we're not.

344
00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:18.895
But there's a whole lot more we will get

345
00:18:18.895 --> 00:18:20.255
to understand spiritually

346
00:18:20.255 --> 00:18:22.615
because of what he plants inside of us.

347
00:18:24.465 --> 00:18:29.275
That's how we know. But in this scene in John 12, that's

348
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:33.415
how the disciples saw Jesus kind of confused,

349
00:18:35.345 --> 00:18:37.285
but there's a third group in John 12.

350
00:18:38.865 --> 00:18:41.715
This is how the Pharisees saw Jesus.

351
00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:46.485
How did the Pharisees see Jesus in this same scene?

352
00:18:49.515 --> 00:18:50.525
This is verse 19.

353
00:18:53.285 --> 00:18:55.945
So the Pharisees, remember the Pharisees are the religious

354
00:18:55.945 --> 00:18:57.785
leaders, Jewish leaders.

355
00:18:59.215 --> 00:19:01.345
They said to one another, you see

356
00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:02.705
that you are gaining nothing.

357
00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:06.825
Look the world, the whole world is

358
00:19:06.825 --> 00:19:09.305
what the Greek says has gone after him.

359
00:19:11.515 --> 00:19:14.045
Like, so can't you just picture these guys huddled in the

360
00:19:14.165 --> 00:19:16.165
dark alley, kind of like just muttering,

361
00:19:16.165 --> 00:19:18.605
shaking their heads, maybe playing rock, paper, scissors.

362
00:19:18.605 --> 00:19:20.365
I don't know what they're doing in that picture, but,

363
00:19:21.865 --> 00:19:24.125
but you could be like, can you believe this guy?

364
00:19:26.275 --> 00:19:29.015
Can you believe him? What are we gonna do about this guy?

365
00:19:29.015 --> 00:19:31.415
What else can we do? We've tried everything.

366
00:19:31.415 --> 00:19:33.375
We've tried to arrest him. We tried to question him.

367
00:19:33.515 --> 00:19:36.575
We can't do anything. The whole world is going out to him.

368
00:19:37.935 --> 00:19:39.315
Now they're exaggerating, of course,

369
00:19:41.315 --> 00:19:42.735
but in a way they're kind of right.

370
00:19:43.155 --> 00:19:46.375
The whole world is going to Jesus.

371
00:19:49.495 --> 00:19:52.115
At the time, the Pharisees whole religious system was built

372
00:19:52.335 --> 00:19:55.635
on keeping people under their thumb by the law

373
00:19:56.615 --> 00:19:58.875
and by fences around that law,

374
00:19:59.175 --> 00:20:01.475
and then systems to sustain the whole thing.

375
00:20:02.545 --> 00:20:05.925
That's how they kept this kind of under their control.

376
00:20:07.155 --> 00:20:08.575
But when Jesus shows up

377
00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:11.695
because of him, he's, he's gaining credibility

378
00:20:11.755 --> 00:20:13.535
and they're starting to lose credibility.

379
00:20:14.525 --> 00:20:16.225
People are starting to question the whole thing.

380
00:20:16.975 --> 00:20:18.105
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

381
00:20:18.205 --> 00:20:20.425
How come, and Jesus is talking about this new law

382
00:20:20.425 --> 00:20:21.825
and different law and not under the law,

383
00:20:21.825 --> 00:20:23.225
and like this is, this doesn't match.

384
00:20:23.225 --> 00:20:25.745
And so they're starting to lose. He's gaining witnesses.

385
00:20:25.745 --> 00:20:27.785
People are testifying about him. He's doing miracles.

386
00:20:27.785 --> 00:20:32.325
They're starting to lose out. And so they started trying

387
00:20:32.545 --> 00:20:34.165
to discredit Jesus.

388
00:20:37.565 --> 00:20:39.265
But I want you to see something here

389
00:20:39.325 --> 00:20:42.265
of the three groups mentioned the crowds, the disciples,

390
00:20:42.265 --> 00:20:44.745
Pharisees, it was the Pharisees

391
00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:46.945
who actually had a pretty clear understanding of

392
00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.085
who Jesus was, right?

393
00:20:49.155 --> 00:20:52.285
Like they saw it, they understood it in one way.

394
00:20:53.325 --> 00:20:58.135
'cause they realized they were gaining nothing by trying

395
00:20:58.195 --> 00:21:00.455
to stop this movement.

396
00:21:01.315 --> 00:21:03.345
You see, you are gaining nothing

397
00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:04.585
that's like they're debating.

398
00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:06.705
Well, we tried this, we tried this.

399
00:21:06.705 --> 00:21:08.985
And we, somebody says, well, we're we gained nothing

400
00:21:09.085 --> 00:21:10.185
by trying any of this stuff.

401
00:21:12.515 --> 00:21:16.995
Which reminds me of a similar idea that showed up later

402
00:21:17.135 --> 00:21:18.635
as the early church grew.

403
00:21:18.815 --> 00:21:20.195
In Acts chapter five,

404
00:21:22.285 --> 00:21:24.305
the church is exploding in numbers.

405
00:21:25.685 --> 00:21:29.145
The Pharisees are still like, can we stop this thing?

406
00:21:30.965 --> 00:21:34.375
Acts five, one of the Pharisees named Gamal,

407
00:21:35.755 --> 00:21:38.655
he stands up and says this about

408
00:21:38.655 --> 00:21:40.255
what they were seeing in Jerusalem.

409
00:21:40.275 --> 00:21:42.335
He said, men of Israel take care of

410
00:21:42.335 --> 00:21:43.815
what you are about to do with these men.

411
00:21:44.955 --> 00:21:48.695
For before these days, Feist wrote up, rose up claiming

412
00:21:48.715 --> 00:21:52.095
to be somebody and a number of men, about 400 joined him.

413
00:21:52.555 --> 00:21:55.095
He was killed. And all who followed him were dispersed

414
00:21:55.115 --> 00:21:57.835
and came to nothing after him.

415
00:21:57.965 --> 00:22:00.035
Judas, the Galilean rose up in the days of the census

416
00:22:00.055 --> 00:22:01.435
and drew away some of the people after him.

417
00:22:01.735 --> 00:22:04.635
He too perished and all who followed him were scattered.

418
00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:07.675
So in the present case, I tell you,

419
00:22:07.745 --> 00:22:09.075
keep away from these men.

420
00:22:09.135 --> 00:22:10.995
Let them alone for if this plan

421
00:22:11.055 --> 00:22:12.835
or this undertaking is of man,

422
00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:14.835
it will fail like those others.

423
00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:19.675
But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them.

424
00:22:19.975 --> 00:22:23.675
You might even be found opposing God.

425
00:22:26.415 --> 00:22:28.635
In other words, if this is a man centered movement,

426
00:22:28.985 --> 00:22:31.475
it's gonna fall apart when this guy dies.

427
00:22:33.095 --> 00:22:35.755
But if it is of God, you can't stop it.

428
00:22:37.875 --> 00:22:40.535
And we sit here 2000 years later, right?

429
00:22:41.445 --> 00:22:45.695
This is a God centered movement. Gamal was absolutely right.

430
00:22:45.725 --> 00:22:47.215
Plus when you think about it, their

431
00:22:47.735 --> 00:22:49.615
animosity toward Jesus was so silly.

432
00:22:49.885 --> 00:22:53.935
It's so denying reality. They were denying undeniable facts.

433
00:22:54.285 --> 00:22:58.655
Like Lazarus was dead for three days and now he's alive.

434
00:23:00.065 --> 00:23:03.115
Everybody knew he was dead. He smelled like he was dead.

435
00:23:03.455 --> 00:23:07.555
And yet he walks out and he's alive.

436
00:23:08.665 --> 00:23:11.315
They can't deny that they can't push that one under the rug.

437
00:23:11.575 --> 00:23:14.515
Yet they would rather destroy the evidence

438
00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:16.515
than change their minds.

439
00:23:19.955 --> 00:23:22.695
That's what actually is said right before our passage.

440
00:23:22.935 --> 00:23:25.575
I read verse nine, but look again at now, verse 10

441
00:23:25.595 --> 00:23:27.295
and 11, right before our passage.

442
00:23:30.005 --> 00:23:33.745
So the chief priest made plans to put Lazarus to death

443
00:23:33.965 --> 00:23:36.425
as well, because on account of him, many

444
00:23:36.425 --> 00:23:38.665
of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.

445
00:23:41.385 --> 00:23:43.675
Like they were agreeing this guy was dead. Now he's alive.

446
00:23:43.675 --> 00:23:44.515
We better kill him again.

447
00:23:48.495 --> 00:23:50.115
It is so silly.

448
00:23:52.395 --> 00:23:56.945
But I wonder, is it possible in our lives today as well

449
00:23:59.655 --> 00:24:02.665
that we see and know God can really do something and

450
00:24:02.685 --> 00:24:05.625
and even we see him do something in someone else's life

451
00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:11.065
and he works this transformation in someone's life

452
00:24:11.125 --> 00:24:12.665
and we say, nah, that can't

453
00:24:12.665 --> 00:24:16.725
happen either.

454
00:24:16.865 --> 00:24:18.485
We say, God could never do that.

455
00:24:18.665 --> 00:24:21.525
Or we say, nah, that could never happen in my life,

456
00:24:22.295 --> 00:24:25.045
especially in my life.

457
00:24:26.315 --> 00:24:27.485
Yeah, okay, that could work for them,

458
00:24:27.485 --> 00:24:30.925
but no, God can't do that in me.

459
00:24:34.235 --> 00:24:37.895
Or maybe you're so wrapped up in your sin that that the

460
00:24:37.895 --> 00:24:39.335
outside might look pretty good.

461
00:24:40.235 --> 00:24:42.695
You've learned how to behave in a kind

462
00:24:42.695 --> 00:24:45.415
of Christian ish culture like we live in.

463
00:24:45.435 --> 00:24:47.735
But you are denying the power of God

464
00:24:47.735 --> 00:24:50.415
for salvation in your own heart,

465
00:24:51.195 --> 00:24:52.895
for healing inside you.

466
00:24:53.195 --> 00:24:54.375
And you're just playing a game

467
00:24:55.185 --> 00:24:57.275
because you're wrapped up with the sin.

468
00:25:00.075 --> 00:25:02.335
Listen, stop hiding.

469
00:25:05.085 --> 00:25:06.825
God already knows you're doing all of it.

470
00:25:08.855 --> 00:25:09.915
He already sees it.

471
00:25:10.925 --> 00:25:12.905
So stop trying to stuff it in the closet.

472
00:25:14.465 --> 00:25:18.235
Stop trying to hide from it. It it, it's safe here.

473
00:25:18.235 --> 00:25:20.555
Listen, I know you might have been in churches

474
00:25:20.605 --> 00:25:25.085
where it's not, but it's safe not

475
00:25:25.105 --> 00:25:29.995
to hide here to say,

476
00:25:30.455 --> 00:25:31.835
man, I've been addicted to this.

477
00:25:32.265 --> 00:25:35.475
I've been doing this. Here's my story.

478
00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:38.475
I know it doesn't look clean like everybody else's does.

479
00:25:38.475 --> 00:25:40.435
Here's the reality. None of our stories are clean.

480
00:25:43.265 --> 00:25:44.725
And so the idea here is

481
00:25:44.725 --> 00:25:46.365
that this is a safe place to struggle.

482
00:25:46.565 --> 00:25:47.965
'cause we're all in the struggle together.

483
00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:50.725
We're all on our knees at the foot of the cross together.

484
00:25:53.805 --> 00:25:56.145
But the Pharisees are illustrations of us.

485
00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:59.465
Whenever we say, no, God can't do that,

486
00:26:01.365 --> 00:26:03.905
or we choose to step outside of it

487
00:26:03.905 --> 00:26:05.545
and say, no, no, I don't want that.

488
00:26:06.835 --> 00:26:07.775
I'd rather have this.

489
00:26:12.365 --> 00:26:14.755
Which leads us to the last perspective on Jesus

490
00:26:15.295 --> 00:26:16.395
in this passage today.

491
00:26:18.135 --> 00:26:19.555
How did Jesus see himself

492
00:26:22.875 --> 00:26:23.895
in light of all of this?

493
00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:25.495
How did Jesus see himself?

494
00:26:28.665 --> 00:26:32.395
Look again at John 12 verses 14 and 15 this time.

495
00:26:36.225 --> 00:26:38.165
And Jesus found a young donkey

496
00:26:38.165 --> 00:26:40.645
and sat on it just as it is written.

497
00:26:41.195 --> 00:26:42.725
Fear, not daughter of Zion.

498
00:26:43.105 --> 00:26:47.605
Behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's cult.

499
00:26:50.905 --> 00:26:53.685
Now, we tend to think of donkeys as kind of silly characters

500
00:26:53.685 --> 00:26:54.805
with an Eddie Murphy voice,

501
00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:59.525
or maybe from a different generation, the logo

502
00:26:59.525 --> 00:27:01.525
of heehaw, right?

503
00:27:02.625 --> 00:27:04.565
Pretty negative. Like we hear donkey

504
00:27:04.565 --> 00:27:05.845
and we think negative thoughts.

505
00:27:08.235 --> 00:27:10.815
Or maybe that's kind of silly, but maybe better.

506
00:27:10.815 --> 00:27:12.415
When you hear this passage, you think

507
00:27:12.415 --> 00:27:13.815
of Jesus when he was doing this,

508
00:27:13.835 --> 00:27:15.415
he was illustrating his humility

509
00:27:15.635 --> 00:27:18.615
as he entered into Jerusalem on a donkey.

510
00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:21.765
Well, that's kind of true,

511
00:27:24.345 --> 00:27:25.525
but there's way more to it.

512
00:27:25.525 --> 00:27:27.925
John is showing us something way deeper here.

513
00:27:30.545 --> 00:27:34.325
Not only is he illustrating something,

514
00:27:35.145 --> 00:27:39.885
but he's quoting an Old Testament prophecy of Zechariah

515
00:27:41.695 --> 00:27:43.705
written hundreds of years earlier.

516
00:27:46.505 --> 00:27:49.625
I want you to listen to what Zechariah chapter nine,

517
00:27:50.125 --> 00:27:52.305
verses nine and 10 say,

518
00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:57.955
rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion.

519
00:27:58.605 --> 00:28:00.995
Shout aloud, daughter of Jerusalem.

520
00:28:01.535 --> 00:28:05.075
Behold, your king is coming to you righteous

521
00:28:05.075 --> 00:28:07.995
and having salvation is he humble

522
00:28:08.375 --> 00:28:12.195
and mounted on a donkey, on a cult,

523
00:28:12.855 --> 00:28:13.995
the full of a donkey.

524
00:28:15.525 --> 00:28:17.445
I will cut off the chariot from E frame

525
00:28:17.545 --> 00:28:20.485
and the warhorse from Jerusalem, meaning I'll bring peace.

526
00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:22.405
The battle bow shall be cut off.

527
00:28:22.705 --> 00:28:25.965
And he, the Savior, shall speak peace

528
00:28:26.785 --> 00:28:27.925
to the nations.

529
00:28:29.945 --> 00:28:33.125
His rule shall be from sea to sea, from the river

530
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:34.765
to the ends of the earth.

531
00:28:34.865 --> 00:28:37.805
In other words, the entire world.

532
00:28:39.205 --> 00:28:43.505
So not only is John tying his actions to this prophecy,

533
00:28:44.865 --> 00:28:46.655
Jesus himself would've known that, right?

534
00:28:47.235 --> 00:28:49.175
He would've known Zechariah nine.

535
00:28:49.875 --> 00:28:51.975
And so what was Jesus choosing to illustrate

536
00:28:52.115 --> 00:28:53.735
and just being a humble figure?

537
00:28:53.955 --> 00:28:57.215
No, he's intending for the crowd to see him as the king.

538
00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:00.225
He knows that's what's coming.

539
00:29:00.285 --> 00:29:02.385
He knows what's going to happen, and he is not doing it.

540
00:29:02.385 --> 00:29:05.065
And in some arrogant, puffed up, pompous kind of way,

541
00:29:05.415 --> 00:29:09.345
he's doing it Like you remember Aladdin,

542
00:29:09.735 --> 00:29:12.905
when Prince Aliya Babo comes rocking into the the palace

543
00:29:13.005 --> 00:29:15.225
and he's got all these elephants doing flips

544
00:29:15.225 --> 00:29:17.025
and all kinds of stuff going and craziness.

545
00:29:17.025 --> 00:29:18.145
Like, look at me.

546
00:29:18.465 --> 00:29:20.465
I am great demanding that you follow me

547
00:29:20.465 --> 00:29:21.585
because of how great I am.

548
00:29:23.035 --> 00:29:27.565
That's not Jesus. Jesus

549
00:29:28.465 --> 00:29:30.605
in a humble, gentle

550
00:29:32.185 --> 00:29:33.725
self-sacrificial kind of way.

551
00:29:35.825 --> 00:29:39.005
By the way, even as he had legitimate authority

552
00:29:39.345 --> 00:29:42.605
and he had the power as the king

553
00:29:42.605 --> 00:29:44.285
of the universe, he had it all.

554
00:29:44.785 --> 00:29:45.925
He could have been that.

555
00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:50.035
But no, he enters in this humble, gentle sac,

556
00:29:50.535 --> 00:29:51.915
self-sacrificial kind of way.

557
00:29:55.665 --> 00:29:57.885
And one main difference between Jesus

558
00:29:58.385 --> 00:30:02.375
and other kings was how he was going

559
00:30:02.375 --> 00:30:04.335
to use his royal power.

560
00:30:06.445 --> 00:30:08.225
He would leverage his divine authority

561
00:30:08.285 --> 00:30:09.345
for other people's good.

562
00:30:11.435 --> 00:30:13.295
He wouldn't win the world through force

563
00:30:13.595 --> 00:30:15.415
or through overthrowing the governments.

564
00:30:15.835 --> 00:30:20.215
He would win it through his sacrificial blood shed to pay

565
00:30:20.395 --> 00:30:25.175
for the sins of sinful humans and reconcile us back to God.

566
00:30:26.475 --> 00:30:27.775
That's how he would do it.

567
00:30:28.775 --> 00:30:32.305
Because remember, humility is not being powerless.

568
00:30:35.185 --> 00:30:37.425
Humility is not weakness or passivity.

569
00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:40.825
Humiliate humility is a redirection

570
00:30:41.165 --> 00:30:44.745
of resources away from yourself and toward others.

571
00:30:46.875 --> 00:30:48.455
And that's what Jesus was doing.

572
00:30:49.605 --> 00:30:52.295
Philippians two talks about that, that he would,

573
00:30:52.525 --> 00:30:53.895
he'd set aside these things

574
00:30:53.955 --> 00:30:56.455
and he, he redirected that towards others.

575
00:31:00.545 --> 00:31:03.235
It's the same for us. We redirect resources away from self

576
00:31:03.235 --> 00:31:04.715
toward others by giving your attention

577
00:31:05.055 --> 00:31:06.675
to someone who's in need,

578
00:31:09.605 --> 00:31:12.425
giving your energy to someone else's brokenness

579
00:31:14.865 --> 00:31:17.805
by using the advantages you have or the freedom or wealth

580
00:31:17.865 --> 00:31:21.725
or power that you have to build others up to advance others.

581
00:31:22.105 --> 00:31:26.395
That's humility. See,

582
00:31:26.395 --> 00:31:28.355
Jesus could have allowed the crowd

583
00:31:28.455 --> 00:31:30.675
to sweep him into political power.

584
00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:33.395
He could have allowed them to make him the next

585
00:31:33.715 --> 00:31:37.115
revolutionary in a string of attempts to overthrow Rome.

586
00:31:40.745 --> 00:31:43.445
But in the face of exaltation from the world,

587
00:31:44.805 --> 00:31:46.875
Jesus chose exaltation from the Father.

588
00:31:49.585 --> 00:31:52.245
And he did it through humiliation on the cross, us

589
00:31:53.555 --> 00:31:54.925
proving he's a good king.

590
00:31:59.195 --> 00:32:00.815
So let's go back to the original question.

591
00:32:02.985 --> 00:32:04.645
Who do you say that Jesus is?

592
00:32:08.235 --> 00:32:09.715
I wanna push on that for a second.

593
00:32:12.415 --> 00:32:17.295
'cause some of us may have been creating Jesus in our own

594
00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:21.545
image, where we take the things

595
00:32:21.545 --> 00:32:22.705
that we like about Jesus,

596
00:32:22.925 --> 00:32:24.745
but we don't let him get too radical

597
00:32:24.745 --> 00:32:26.745
because then the culture might think we're crazy.

598
00:32:28.755 --> 00:32:30.255
So we keep it kind of right here in the middle.

599
00:32:32.165 --> 00:32:34.745
But really it's just making a God in our own

600
00:32:35.115 --> 00:32:38.715
image afraid.

601
00:32:38.715 --> 00:32:40.605
That's what what much of America has done.

602
00:32:42.345 --> 00:32:44.325
And I say that because I've done that

603
00:32:47.205 --> 00:32:48.655
leading to a view of Jesus

604
00:32:48.795 --> 00:32:51.455
that's mostly about fulfilling my own desires

605
00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:53.905
and getting what I want.

606
00:32:58.155 --> 00:33:00.335
Listen, Jesus is not

607
00:33:02.055 --> 00:33:03.935
a genie up there granting wishes.

608
00:33:06.715 --> 00:33:07.965
He's not an ATM.

609
00:33:11.405 --> 00:33:15.255
He's not just an all powerful doctor to heal every disease

610
00:33:15.255 --> 00:33:16.495
and every sickness and illness.

611
00:33:19.225 --> 00:33:21.565
Now, does God give good gifts? Yes, he does.

612
00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:25.325
But we should not follow Jesus just for the blessings,

613
00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:29.295
just for what he gives us.

614
00:33:29.475 --> 00:33:34.255
He calls us to pick up our cross and die to self.

615
00:33:35.325 --> 00:33:38.615
That is part of the deal of following him.

616
00:33:42.135 --> 00:33:44.875
And that's what he's portraying to us here in John 12,

617
00:33:45.915 --> 00:33:50.785
that this same savior who died for your forgiveness,

618
00:33:52.635 --> 00:33:56.615
he also reveals himself as the Lord, as the king.

619
00:34:00.145 --> 00:34:02.885
And he gives us grace. Absolutely.

620
00:34:02.945 --> 00:34:05.005
We should praise him for that.

621
00:34:05.265 --> 00:34:09.085
And in response to his grace, he then calls us to submit

622
00:34:09.085 --> 00:34:10.485
to him as our king

623
00:34:12.625 --> 00:34:14.635
that he's a good gracious king.

624
00:34:14.695 --> 00:34:19.575
So I can submit to him, maybe

625
00:34:20.715 --> 00:34:23.575
you've tried to avoid him for too long.

626
00:34:27.705 --> 00:34:31.325
You can't avoid him. You can't do nothing with Jesus.

627
00:34:32.545 --> 00:34:35.585
Or maybe,

628
00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:38.765
maybe you haven't tried to avoid him.

629
00:34:38.845 --> 00:34:41.605
Maybe like the church in at Ephesus in Revelation three.

630
00:34:41.615 --> 00:34:43.685
Maybe you've lost your first love

631
00:34:48.215 --> 00:34:49.595
and you can remember a time when you

632
00:34:49.595 --> 00:34:50.795
were sold out to the Lord.

633
00:34:52.345 --> 00:34:55.165
It was right after camp or in your college years or,

634
00:34:55.305 --> 00:34:57.805
or maybe it was right after that big traumatic experience in

635
00:34:57.805 --> 00:34:58.845
your thirties or forties and

636
00:34:58.905 --> 00:35:00.845
and you, you said, yes, I'm sold out to the Lord.

637
00:35:01.005 --> 00:35:03.085
I need to live from ready to live for him.

638
00:35:03.545 --> 00:35:05.965
But now you've grown cold

639
00:35:07.775 --> 00:35:11.715
to the white hot reality of Christ as the king.

640
00:35:15.975 --> 00:35:20.395
Listen, seeing him like this should change everything.

641
00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:25.475
The way we spend money, the way we spend our time,

642
00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:28.755
the way we parent, the way we lead,

643
00:35:28.975 --> 00:35:31.515
the way we govern, the way we parent.

644
00:35:33.935 --> 00:35:36.445
Everything should change if he is the king.

645
00:35:41.265 --> 00:35:45.895
Or maybe some of us are giving

646
00:35:47.155 --> 00:35:49.405
agreement mentally to this as a concept,

647
00:35:51.455 --> 00:35:53.635
but are not allowing it to really change our lives,

648
00:35:55.065 --> 00:35:58.005
to really take root deeply into us,

649
00:35:58.005 --> 00:36:00.245
to show up in bold living faith.

650
00:36:04.755 --> 00:36:06.655
Listen, I I, I know my own heart.

651
00:36:06.775 --> 00:36:09.655
I know everyone's heart is generally the same.

652
00:36:09.745 --> 00:36:12.055
We're all looking for joy, right?

653
00:36:14.335 --> 00:36:18.625
Maximum joy. However we can find it.

654
00:36:20.365 --> 00:36:21.395
Where do we find it?

655
00:36:23.115 --> 00:36:27.845
Well, it's only found in living in response to this grace

656
00:36:27.985 --> 00:36:29.565
of God with him as our king.

657
00:36:31.065 --> 00:36:33.685
Joy is only found in the way God designed life to work.

658
00:36:34.705 --> 00:36:36.245
That's the way he designed it

659
00:36:36.505 --> 00:36:40.085
to work more than whether people think of you more than

660
00:36:40.085 --> 00:36:43.845
how much money you have, more than what position you have.

661
00:36:43.945 --> 00:36:46.765
And in, in culture, more than all of that,

662
00:36:46.975 --> 00:36:50.405
God's grace is better and joy is found there.

663
00:36:50.955 --> 00:36:55.775
Amen. So

664
00:36:55.795 --> 00:36:57.295
who do you say that Jesus is?

665
00:37:00.445 --> 00:37:02.415
That question demands an answer.

666
00:37:04.525 --> 00:37:07.305
An answer that when you get it correct will change your

667
00:37:07.335 --> 00:37:08.385
life completely.

668
00:37:11.955 --> 00:37:12.855
And may God help us.
