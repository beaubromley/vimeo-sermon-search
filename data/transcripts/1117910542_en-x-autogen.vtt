00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:31.085
We're gonna get started tonight. I think.

9
00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.205
Uh, we're gonna do a song at the beginning,

10
00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:36.125
but, um, we do that.

11
00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:41.205
I like before we get started. Thank you, uh, father.

12
00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:43.485

Um, we thank you that we get to be in your presence

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:51.765
for your son, or thank your father that you have

16
00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:55.125
torn the veil that you have opened,

17
00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:01.835
opened a way for us to be in a right relationship with you,

18
00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:06.595
to know you even when we didn't deserve it.

19
00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:11.955
So Father, tonight, as we study who you are, help us to be,

20
00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:17.375
um, invigorated father, help us to,

21
00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:19.895
uh, be excited about that.

22
00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:24.055
Help us to, uh, have a desire to know you more

23
00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:27.095
and more prayer.

24
00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:31.255
Amen. Alright, so Mark's going to start the song

25
00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:36.575
and, uh, we've all, we're all gonna stand to sing, right?

26
00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:39.055
Yeah. Be Is this a singalong song?

27
00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:40.775
Singalong. It's s single along Let

28
00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:44.535
S sing song mark.

29
00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:47.095
So the story is we bended on a song every week,

30
00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:49.695
and I had a song, mark had a song, and we arm wrestle

31
00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:52.095
and we decided to go song

32
00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:52.655
Righteousness.

33
00:05:00.475 --> 00:05:01.475
I

34
00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.025
Amen. You guys can

35
00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:02.075
see. Thank you so much. Great stuff.

36
00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.475
That, uh, that's good stuff.

37
00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:08.435
And, um, so Alan wrote with markers last week

38
00:06:08.575 --> 00:06:11.155
and this week we have two markers.

39
00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.835
We have a red marker and orange marker.

40
00:06:13.995 --> 00:06:16.395
I pulled this one out first. Now I'm gonna test it out.

41
00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:18.715
Wait, is that the one? Yeah.

42
00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:21.715
So I said, wow, that's a good marker.

43
00:06:22.735 --> 00:06:26.755
Now pull out this orange marker. You better watch out. Oh,

44
00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:28.145
Yeah.

45
00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:33.275
Anyway, we're only gonna use red markers.

46
00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:40.355
That's not right. That's, um, love you guys.

47
00:06:40.355 --> 00:06:43.075
So tonight we're gonna talk about God's existence

48
00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:44.755
and his knowability.

49
00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:47.075
We're gonna start tonight. I want you,

50
00:06:47.075 --> 00:06:48.835
I hope you picked up your memory verse.

51
00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:52.155
So the memory verse is Psalm 46, 10.

52
00:06:52.735 --> 00:06:56.355
And, um, I wanted to start with this

53
00:06:56.355 --> 00:06:58.315
because I think it kind of sets the tone a little bit

54
00:06:58.315 --> 00:07:01.275
because for some of us, it's a busy week.

55
00:07:01.385 --> 00:07:04.915
It's a busy day, and it's like, we gotta go to class.

56
00:07:05.415 --> 00:07:07.515
But tonight we're just gonna learn about, we're gonna rest

57
00:07:07.515 --> 00:07:10.995
and we're gonna be still and know that he has God.

58
00:07:11.935 --> 00:07:15.395
Um, we're gonna study and enjoy his existence.

59
00:07:16.975 --> 00:07:20.195
And, um, and we're going celebrate it

60
00:07:20.295 --> 00:07:21.395
and, and praise in court.

61
00:07:21.455 --> 00:07:25.195
So our, our verse is Psalm 46, 10 says, be still

62
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.435
and know that I'm, God, I'll be exalted among the nations.

63
00:07:28.585 --> 00:07:30.475
I'll be exalted in all the Earth.

64
00:07:31.095 --> 00:07:32.195
And, and really we want that

65
00:07:32.195 --> 00:07:34.195
to be the end game on our study is

66
00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:36.315
that God has exalted both in our hearts and minds

67
00:07:36.735 --> 00:07:38.875
and then with our mouths as we go out to others.

68
00:07:39.015 --> 00:07:43.915
And Psalm 46, 10, uh, comes at the end of, uh, a chapter

69
00:07:43.935 --> 00:07:44.995
of Psalms that I love.

70
00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:47.875
It's been important at several different points in my life.

71
00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:49.995
Two of which I will tell you guys about just

72
00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:52.755
so you can know a little bit more, um, about me.

73
00:07:53.795 --> 00:07:58.435
I was, uh, in medical school in 2001 on September 11th

74
00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:01.675
when, um, the Twin Towers were destroy.

75
00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.435
And there were several of us that were part

76
00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:06.795
of the Christian Medical and Dental Society group.

77
00:08:06.935 --> 00:08:09.315
And there were several that, that weren't, were just around.

78
00:08:09.315 --> 00:08:10.835
And we were gathered in the lecture hall.

79
00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:12.995
Um, when that happened.

80
00:08:14.175 --> 00:08:18.355
And it was as many of you, all of you who were around, uh,

81
00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:20.835
remember, that was total shock and devastation.

82
00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:25.355
And, and we saw the Lord and we rely on him to be our peace

83
00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:27.155
and our comfort and our refuge and our strength.

84
00:08:27.155 --> 00:08:28.835
And so we turn to Psalm 46

85
00:08:29.455 --> 00:08:32.355
and we read Psalm 46 in that group.

86
00:08:32.355 --> 00:08:35.115
And it starts off, as many of you know, God is our refuge

87
00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:38.395
and our strength, a very present help and trouble.

88
00:08:38.865 --> 00:08:41.235
Therefore, we'll not fear, though the earth gives way,

89
00:08:42.215 --> 00:08:45.115
though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea.

90
00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:48.555
And so in that moment, uh, it felt like

91
00:08:49.575 --> 00:08:51.555
the mountains were being moving into the heart of the sea

92
00:08:51.555 --> 00:08:52.875
and things were crashing down.

93
00:08:53.415 --> 00:08:55.035
Uh, but we knew that the ward was our

94
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.165
refuge and our strength.

95
00:08:56.185 --> 00:08:57.925
And then we read on and we get to the end.

96
00:08:58.385 --> 00:09:00.885
And then there's this peace, this message of peace

97
00:09:00.885 --> 00:09:02.085
where God says, be still

98
00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:05.085
and know that I'm, uh, in the midst of all this calamity,

99
00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:06.645
I'll be exalted among the nations.

100
00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:08.245
I'll be exalted in all the earth.

101
00:09:09.225 --> 00:09:12.805
And so, um, just as we jump into the study of who God is,

102
00:09:12.805 --> 00:09:14.365
that's ultimately, he's our refuge.

103
00:09:14.515 --> 00:09:17.365
He's our strength, he's our comfort and our hope.

104
00:09:17.365 --> 00:09:20.925
And then, uh, fast forward a few years, um,

105
00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:22.685
so I was doing medical school in

106
00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:24.005
Texas, was married at the time.

107
00:09:24.035 --> 00:09:25.965
Fast forward several years, we got moved to Oklahoma,

108
00:09:26.905 --> 00:09:28.885
not part of the Lewis plan, part of God's plan.

109
00:09:29.545 --> 00:09:33.085
And, um, found ourselves in a really neat community group

110
00:09:33.745 --> 00:09:36.365
and, um, really neat community group, great friends.

111
00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:39.325
And it was a time in our lives when our kids

112
00:09:39.325 --> 00:09:40.485
were young and they were really busy.

113
00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:43.645
And in 2006, if you remember,

114
00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:45.845
we started Saturday Night Service at Henderson Hills.

115
00:09:45.845 --> 00:09:47.525
And so our community group divided,

116
00:09:47.585 --> 00:09:49.885
and half of us came to Saturday nights

117
00:09:49.885 --> 00:09:52.005
and half of us stayed on Sunday mornings.

118
00:09:52.705 --> 00:09:56.205
And, um, and so there was a,

119
00:09:56.435 --> 00:09:57.765
most community groups are named

120
00:09:58.135 --> 00:10:00.045
after whoever's leading the group, right?

121
00:10:00.105 --> 00:10:02.925
So like the Smith Group or the Jones Group was Piper Group.

122
00:10:03.465 --> 00:10:05.245
And, um, but our group decided,

123
00:10:05.365 --> 00:10:08.125
I wasn't a leader at the time, uh, of, of that class,

124
00:10:08.145 --> 00:10:09.725
but there were three couples

125
00:10:10.185 --> 00:10:13.125
and they decided to name our class Pier 4 61.

126
00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:16.125
That's interesting. Pier 4 61.

127
00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:18.245
But they named it after Psalm 46 1.

128
00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:22.045
I said, okay, why up here? He said, well, says

129
00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.405
the Lord is our refuge

130
00:10:24.465 --> 00:10:26.485
and our strength for very present health and trouble.

131
00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:30.525
And for them that represented a refuge, a place to come

132
00:10:30.785 --> 00:10:35.365
and heal, and a place to refuel for the journey.

133
00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:37.765
And that's what appears when our ships at sail

134
00:10:37.785 --> 00:10:39.285
and we're, we're out on the waters

135
00:10:39.285 --> 00:10:43.605
and the waves are crashing in that, um, the Lord becomes our

136
00:10:44.225 --> 00:10:46.525
refuge and our shrink and appear where we can dock.

137
00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:49.485
But we don't stay at that dock forever, right?

138
00:10:49.705 --> 00:10:51.245
We stay there for a period of time.

139
00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:52.285
We come and refuel

140
00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:56.325
and refresh, maybe clean the barn pools off the side

141
00:10:56.325 --> 00:10:57.925
of the boat a little bit and we go back out.

142
00:10:58.975 --> 00:11:00.635
So we saw that as a purpose for community

143
00:11:00.635 --> 00:11:02.075
groups, uh, for us.

144
00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:06.435
So as I, as I saw that, uh, mark had chosen Psalm 46

145
00:11:07.015 --> 00:11:09.475
as a memory verse for this week, that really got me excited.

146
00:11:10.415 --> 00:11:14.035
And, um, choosing

147
00:11:14.055 --> 00:11:16.075
to follow Allen Rice was not part of my plan.

148
00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.075
It just kind of happened that way.

149
00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:21.355
But I have, I created what I call Allen Rice Bingo card,

150
00:11:22.445 --> 00:11:24.995
which involved things like monkey crap

151
00:11:26.295 --> 00:11:27.475
and other things

152
00:11:27.475 --> 00:11:30.275
that Sean Connery is on the Ele Allen Rice Bingo card

153
00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:32.475
and things you may have checked off throughout the week.

154
00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:35.435
And so, um, as I came to,

155
00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:37.835
I thought I need my own bingo card, Anita,

156
00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:39.475
a TR Lewis bingo card.

157
00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:43.235
But, um, I found a quote,

158
00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:44.955
it's actually a passage I want read.

159
00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:47.315
It's from Charles Spurgeon,

160
00:11:47.315 --> 00:11:48.635
but it's from this, it's a quote,

161
00:11:48.745 --> 00:11:51.355
it's actually a long passage that, um,

162
00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:54.045
JI Packer includes in this book, knowing God.

163
00:11:54.045 --> 00:11:55.445
So if you haven't read this book, I hadn't

164
00:11:55.445 --> 00:11:56.485
read this book until this year.

165
00:11:56.905 --> 00:11:58.885
And so I started reading it several months ago

166
00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:02.805
and, um, really, really, uh, deep

167
00:12:02.865 --> 00:12:04.165
and encouraging and insightful.

168
00:12:04.165 --> 00:12:06.805
But this is a quote from Ch Spurgeon, the passage on opus

169
00:12:06.805 --> 00:12:11.735
with, and this is from 1855, says,

170
00:12:11.735 --> 00:12:13.775
it has been said by someone that the proper study

171
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:14.975
of mankind is man.

172
00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:16.935
And I'll not oppose the idea,

173
00:12:16.995 --> 00:12:19.535
but I believe that it's equally true, that the proper study

174
00:12:19.595 --> 00:12:21.295
of God's elect is God.

175
00:12:21.915 --> 00:12:24.335
The proper study of a Christian is the Godhead,

176
00:12:25.195 --> 00:12:27.255
the highest science, the loftiest speculation,

177
00:12:27.335 --> 00:12:29.935
mightest philosophy, which can ever engage the attention

178
00:12:29.955 --> 00:12:34.895
of a child of God is the name, the nature, the person,

179
00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:37.295
the work, the doings,

180
00:12:37.295 --> 00:12:40.655
and the existence of the great God who he calls his Father.

181
00:12:41.685 --> 00:12:44.335
There's something exceedingly improving to the mind.

182
00:12:44.915 --> 00:12:48.175
And a contemplation of the divinity is a subject so vast

183
00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:49.815
that all of our thoughts are lost.

184
00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.695
And it's immense, so deep

185
00:12:51.695 --> 00:12:54.335
that our pride is drowned in its infinity.

186
00:12:55.355 --> 00:12:58.215
I'm gonna read that again. It's so deep.

187
00:12:58.395 --> 00:13:01.575
God is so deep that our pride is drowned in his infinity.

188
00:13:02.675 --> 00:13:05.015
Our subjects we can compass and grapple with,

189
00:13:05.395 --> 00:13:07.495
and then we feel a kind of self content

190
00:13:07.915 --> 00:13:09.135
and go our way with the thought.

191
00:13:09.135 --> 00:13:10.175
Behold, I'm wise.

192
00:13:11.035 --> 00:13:14.335
But when we come to this master science finding

193
00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.615
that our plum line cannot sound its death,

194
00:13:16.995 --> 00:13:20.375
and that our eagle eye cannot see its height, we turn away

195
00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:22.255
with the thought that vain man would be wise.

196
00:13:23.275 --> 00:13:25.335
But he is like a wild asses cult.

197
00:13:26.075 --> 00:13:29.495
And with solemn explanation, I am but of yesterday

198
00:13:29.515 --> 00:13:34.015
and know nothing, no subject of contemplation will tend

199
00:13:34.035 --> 00:13:36.655
to more humble the mind than thoughts of God.

200
00:13:37.595 --> 00:13:40.255
But while the subject humbles the mind, it also expands it.

201
00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:42.235
He who often thinks

202
00:13:42.235 --> 00:13:46.075
of God will have a larger mind than the man who simply pods

203
00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:47.315
around this narrow globe.

204
00:13:48.095 --> 00:13:50.395
The most excellent study for expanding the soul

205
00:13:51.095 --> 00:13:54.275
is the science of Christ, him crucified

206
00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:57.195
and the knowledge of the Godhead in a glorious trinity,

207
00:13:57.785 --> 00:13:59.555
nothing will so enlarge the intellect.

208
00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:02.675
Nothing so magnify the whole soul of man.

209
00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:07.315
It is about as a devout earnest, continued investigation

210
00:14:07.495 --> 00:14:09.515
of the great subject of the DAE.

211
00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:12.835
And whilst humbly in expanding this subject is

212
00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:14.555
imminently consolatory.

213
00:14:15.655 --> 00:14:19.515
Oh, there is in contemplating Christ, a balm for every wound

214
00:14:20.615 --> 00:14:21.835
and musing on the Father.

215
00:14:21.835 --> 00:14:23.595
There is a quietness for every priest

216
00:14:24.935 --> 00:14:26.435
in the influence of the Holy Ghost.

217
00:14:26.435 --> 00:14:30.995
There is a balam for every soar. Would you lose your sorrow?

218
00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:33.815
Would you drown your own cares?

219
00:14:34.445 --> 00:14:37.335
Then go plunge yourself in the godheads deepest sea.

220
00:14:37.875 --> 00:14:39.335
Be lost in his immensity

221
00:14:39.635 --> 00:14:42.575
and you shall come forth as from a couch of rest,

222
00:14:43.285 --> 00:14:45.175
refreshed and invigorated.

223
00:14:46.095 --> 00:14:48.735
I know nothing which can so comfort the soul so calm,

224
00:14:48.915 --> 00:14:51.645
so calm and swell buildings of sorrow and grief.

225
00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:54.325
So speak peace to the winds of trial

226
00:14:54.465 --> 00:14:57.605
as a devout musing upon the subject of the Godhead.

227
00:14:58.295 --> 00:15:00.995
It is to that subject that I invite you to this morning.

228
00:15:03.855 --> 00:15:05.275
And so it's with those words that we come.

229
00:15:05.295 --> 00:15:07.155
So some of us need to be humbled tonight

230
00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:09.035
by the study of God.

231
00:15:09.035 --> 00:15:10.555
Some of us need to be encouraged

232
00:15:10.575 --> 00:15:12.395
or expanded in our thoughts of God.

233
00:15:12.815 --> 00:15:14.955
And some of us need to be consoled and comforted.

234
00:15:16.045 --> 00:15:17.465
So we're gonna jump into the notes

235
00:15:18.245 --> 00:15:20.945
and we're gonna study first the existence of God.

236
00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.385
So I included this verse from Romans one

237
00:15:25.975 --> 00:15:27.065
that many of us have heard.

238
00:15:27.065 --> 00:15:29.465
It says, for what can be known about God has claimed to them

239
00:15:29.785 --> 00:15:30.985
'cause God has shown it to them

240
00:15:31.605 --> 00:15:35.025
for his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power

241
00:15:35.025 --> 00:15:37.265
and divine nature have been clearly perceived ever

242
00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:38.505
before, the creation of the world

243
00:15:39.005 --> 00:15:40.265
and the things that have been made.

244
00:15:40.285 --> 00:15:41.345
So there without excuse.

245
00:15:42.605 --> 00:15:44.065
So tonight we're gonna try to look at this,

246
00:15:44.605 --> 00:15:46.185
at this verse a little more deeply.

247
00:15:47.315 --> 00:15:49.705
We're gonna try to study these truths in a deeper way

248
00:15:49.895 --> 00:15:52.025
because we kind of come to the foundation tonight.

249
00:15:52.025 --> 00:15:54.585
We come with the understanding that God does exist.

250
00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:57.345
And many of us like me probably grew up that way.

251
00:15:58.005 --> 00:16:00.945
Um, but we do have evidences of him all around us.

252
00:16:01.805 --> 00:16:04.025
And God created us to yearn for him.

253
00:16:04.165 --> 00:16:07.585
He created in us that spirit that wants us to yearn for him,

254
00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:09.945
or at least create a man with that deficit,

255
00:16:10.775 --> 00:16:13.865
that deficit in our lives that, that that is, that yearning

256
00:16:13.865 --> 00:16:15.425
for something bigger than ourselves.

257
00:16:15.525 --> 00:16:18.185
And so we'll talk about that as we go along the way.

258
00:16:18.965 --> 00:16:22.665
And so it's in that, that we live

259
00:16:22.685 --> 00:16:24.345
and we can really only see the world.

260
00:16:24.605 --> 00:16:27.105
We only get to see the world through this lens that we live.

261
00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:28.865
We get to see the world through the temporary.

262
00:16:29.685 --> 00:16:33.025
But God is infinite. He's bigger than we can ever know.

263
00:16:33.245 --> 00:16:35.625
And so it's with that, that we come tonight.

264
00:16:35.645 --> 00:16:37.745
So our first point that we're gonna look at

265
00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:38.865
is our inner sense of God.

266
00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:41.825
So our first kind of idea of the existence of God is

267
00:16:41.825 --> 00:16:43.825
that we have this inner sense of God.

268
00:16:44.565 --> 00:16:46.985
And Gruden makes the argument in his book, um,

269
00:16:47.335 --> 00:16:49.625
that all humans everywhere have an inner sense.

270
00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:52.665
That God exists, an inner sense that there's a creator.

271
00:16:54.165 --> 00:16:56.345
And you look around, you can say, maybe in my workplace,

272
00:16:56.345 --> 00:16:59.385
maybe in my school, maybe in my family, there are people

273
00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:01.545
that don't, they don't exhibit that.

274
00:17:02.365 --> 00:17:03.625
We say everybody has that,

275
00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:05.465
but they don't, they don't exhibit it.

276
00:17:06.205 --> 00:17:08.785
And that's because we're a broken people. We're fallen.

277
00:17:08.935 --> 00:17:11.185
It's like falses in, in Romans one,

278
00:17:11.615 --> 00:17:13.945
that we're born into sin, we're born into aquity.

279
00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:16.345
And it's because of that fall of Adam that, that

280
00:17:16.345 --> 00:17:20.225
that's mask, it's jaded and that we can't see the right way.

281
00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:23.945
And so in that perfect, in perfect creation where Adam

282
00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:25.145
and Eve were created a perfect

283
00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:26.745
relation, perfect unity with God.

284
00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.825
So that's a natural part of how humans are made.

285
00:17:29.445 --> 00:17:31.905
But we exist now in this broken form

286
00:17:32.765 --> 00:17:36.345
and we exist that way until God pulls back the baby, right?

287
00:17:37.205 --> 00:17:40.185
So we're illuminated by the Spirit to fully understand

288
00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:41.865
and fully trust in God.

289
00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:46.905
In John chapter 20, Jesus says,

290
00:17:47.975 --> 00:17:49.725
have you believed 'cause have seen me?

291
00:17:50.065 --> 00:17:53.125
So blessed are those who have not seen and yet believed.

292
00:17:53.675 --> 00:17:55.965
Blessed are those who have not seen yet believed.

293
00:17:56.865 --> 00:17:59.845
And so we, we go, we we're thankful for that tonight.

294
00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:02.005
We're thankful that God has pulled back the veil,

295
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.525
but we understand that there are so many that have not.

296
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.365
And so in those verses in Psalms I have down there,

297
00:18:08.365 --> 00:18:11.645
Psalm 14, one, um,

298
00:18:13.015 --> 00:18:16.205
Psalm 53, 1 in Psalm 10, 3, 3 4.

299
00:18:16.665 --> 00:18:20.325
And basically the gist of those verses, uh, David is writing

300
00:18:20.325 --> 00:18:22.165
and says, the pool says in his heart, there is no God.

301
00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:24.765
'cause those people are corrupt.

302
00:18:25.475 --> 00:18:28.605
They do have vulnerable deeds. There's no one who does good.

303
00:18:29.385 --> 00:18:31.645
The Lord looks down from heaven on the children of man

304
00:18:31.645 --> 00:18:34.205
to see if there are any who understand any

305
00:18:34.225 --> 00:18:35.285
who seek after God.

306
00:18:36.145 --> 00:18:37.925
He writes, they've all turned aside together.

307
00:18:37.925 --> 00:18:38.925
They have become corrupt.

308
00:18:39.395 --> 00:18:41.245
There's no one who does good, not even one.

309
00:18:42.385 --> 00:18:45.885
And so that speaks to our natural depravity, our depravity

310
00:18:45.885 --> 00:18:47.605
of man that exists in this broken world.

311
00:18:48.505 --> 00:18:52.405
And we see that. We see evidence of that, um, all around us.

312
00:18:53.025 --> 00:18:56.885
But even in light of that, even in light of that, of,

313
00:18:56.905 --> 00:18:59.805
of the folks that just reject God in all

314
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.565
of these different cultures all around the world,

315
00:19:01.715 --> 00:19:04.405
Alan mentioned it a couple weeks ago, that

316
00:19:05.425 --> 00:19:08.565
so many people groups have this idea of a divine creator.

317
00:19:08.785 --> 00:19:10.845
You think about all the different world religions

318
00:19:10.845 --> 00:19:14.365
and there's, there are tons of different creation narratives

319
00:19:14.365 --> 00:19:16.845
that have been created over the years.

320
00:19:17.585 --> 00:19:20.285
And we look back and there's a, there's that sense of

321
00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.485
that yearning for a year, yearning

322
00:19:22.485 --> 00:19:24.685
that's something bigger than ourselves.

323
00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:26.405
And it, but it manifests in a variety

324
00:19:26.425 --> 00:19:27.725
of different ways, right?

325
00:19:27.785 --> 00:19:30.165
For some, they, they create idols out

326
00:19:30.165 --> 00:19:31.765
of animals and, and creatures.

327
00:19:31.765 --> 00:19:34.165
And some create an idol out of themselves.

328
00:19:35.305 --> 00:19:37.485
Um, one of the, one of the things, one of the roles

329
00:19:37.485 --> 00:19:39.245
that I do at the College of Medicine,

330
00:19:39.285 --> 00:19:40.645
I teach 'em the humanities section.

331
00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:42.725
I teach a spirituality and medicine course.

332
00:19:43.745 --> 00:19:47.125
And so in that class, we kind of explore the different

333
00:19:48.805 --> 00:19:52.085
manifestations of spirituality in different people groups.

334
00:19:52.745 --> 00:19:55.325
And we study different formal world religions,

335
00:19:55.325 --> 00:19:59.405
but also the idea of spirituality, the idea that as we come,

336
00:20:00.225 --> 00:20:03.325
uh, as part of our human expression is this idea

337
00:20:03.325 --> 00:20:04.925
that there's something bigger than ourselves

338
00:20:04.925 --> 00:20:06.965
and that desire to be a part of it, right?

339
00:20:06.965 --> 00:20:09.125
If you think about these world religions, that there's a,

340
00:20:09.195 --> 00:20:13.685
there's an innate desire to relate to our creator.

341
00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:17.405
And, and we see that in, in these ancient civilization.

342
00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:21.005
What happens when you go to, to Central America

343
00:20:21.545 --> 00:20:23.485
or to South America, the Asian,

344
00:20:23.485 --> 00:20:25.845
you see ancient ruins or even in Rome.

345
00:20:25.845 --> 00:20:27.725
What, what are those ancient ruins typically

346
00:20:27.745 --> 00:20:31.385
of Deities?

347
00:20:31.385 --> 00:20:34.105
They're deities are temples of places of worship, right?

348
00:20:34.165 --> 00:20:36.145
So all throughout history,

349
00:20:36.145 --> 00:20:37.985
these civilizations have created these things

350
00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:39.105
that have stood the test of time.

351
00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:41.865
There have been an idea to worship something.

352
00:20:42.565 --> 00:20:46.625
And so we would say that, that that idea, the idea that

353
00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:49.525
we have this innate inner sense

354
00:20:49.595 --> 00:20:53.205
that there is a God isn't evidence of his existence.

355
00:20:53.225 --> 00:20:55.325
And we'll, we'll talk more about that as we go on.

356
00:20:56.625 --> 00:21:00.165
And the power that, um, the, the next kind of point there

357
00:21:00.165 --> 00:21:03.325
that not only have all people kind of created these ideas

358
00:21:03.385 --> 00:21:05.645
of worship, of a, of a deity, but,

359
00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:08.725
and we see people turn to that in times of need, right?

360
00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:12.085
In times of crisis, in times of need, that inner sense

361
00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:14.045
of something bigger than yourself is exposed.

362
00:21:14.265 --> 00:21:16.045
And in Christianity, sometimes we call

363
00:21:16.045 --> 00:21:17.405
that coming to the end of yourself.

364
00:21:18.025 --> 00:21:20.325
But people who don't have a box for that, like they,

365
00:21:20.325 --> 00:21:21.925
they're seeking something there.

366
00:21:22.065 --> 00:21:23.365
The quote is, there's,

367
00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.725
there are no atheists in foxholes, right?

368
00:21:26.315 --> 00:21:28.365
It's a quote that gets, it gets thrown around.

369
00:21:29.105 --> 00:21:31.445
And it's the power, the power that

370
00:21:32.065 --> 00:21:35.565
God has in his existence is exerted in those moments

371
00:21:35.825 --> 00:21:39.165
of crisis, even in the lives of those who reject him, right?

372
00:21:39.165 --> 00:21:41.685
Even in the lives of folks that that would say,

373
00:21:42.285 --> 00:21:43.565
I don't, I don't believe in God.

374
00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:45.005
I don't, I don't believe

375
00:21:45.005 --> 00:21:46.925
that there even is God, I don't believe there's a creator.

376
00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:49.685
But then when, when that strikes, it kind of forces

377
00:21:49.915 --> 00:21:51.885
that a little bit, I think, to the surface.

378
00:21:53.465 --> 00:21:57.605
And so, um, the last, the last kind of point in this idea

379
00:21:57.605 --> 00:22:01.125
that this inner sense is this idea of logical arguments.

380
00:22:01.125 --> 00:22:03.805
And so at the end of your notes, I included, I wanna come

381
00:22:03.805 --> 00:22:05.885
to these at the end, but there's some really neat arguments

382
00:22:05.915 --> 00:22:10.685
from, um, from Thomas client kindness

383
00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:13.005
or client, the Proof of God existence.

384
00:22:13.025 --> 00:22:14.925
So, we'll, we'll get to that, actually.

385
00:22:14.925 --> 00:22:15.845
Let's go ahead and we'll walk through that.

386
00:22:16.895 --> 00:22:17.685
We'll, no, we're not.

387
00:22:17.685 --> 00:22:20.565
We'll go to that at the end. But, um, so we'll get

388
00:22:20.565 --> 00:22:22.125
to those at the end of the evidence section.

389
00:22:22.225 --> 00:22:25.245
But the second, second thing we come to is evidences

390
00:22:25.265 --> 00:22:26.285
of God in nature.

391
00:22:27.105 --> 00:22:29.165
So Romans one 20 speaks to this, that everything

392
00:22:29.165 --> 00:22:31.965
that God created, he reveals his eternal

393
00:22:31.975 --> 00:22:33.645
power and his divine nature.

394
00:22:34.425 --> 00:22:36.085
And we see that in creation, right?

395
00:22:36.505 --> 00:22:41.245
In Psalms chapter 19, uh, says,

396
00:22:41.755 --> 00:22:43.565
heavens declare the glory of God

397
00:22:43.785 --> 00:22:45.965
and the sky above proclaims his candy works.

398
00:22:46.025 --> 00:22:49.245
We look up to the sky, up to an Oklahoma sunset, up

399
00:22:49.245 --> 00:22:53.445
to a sunrise with the sea, the glory of God from day to day,

400
00:22:53.495 --> 00:22:56.125
pours out speech from night to night where he's knowledge,

401
00:22:56.615 --> 00:22:58.405
there is no speech nor their words,

402
00:22:58.415 --> 00:22:59.645
whose voice is not heard.

403
00:22:59.855 --> 00:23:01.445
Their voice goes out through all the earth

404
00:23:01.465 --> 00:23:05.885
and their words to the end of the earth in them as a tent

405
00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:07.565
for the sun, which comes out like a

406
00:23:07.565 --> 00:23:09.045
bridegroom leaving his chamber.

407
00:23:09.595 --> 00:23:11.525
Like a strong man runs its course with joy.

408
00:23:11.955 --> 00:23:13.965
It's rising from the ends of the heavens

409
00:23:13.965 --> 00:23:16.645
and it's circuit to the ends of, there's nothing

410
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:17.765
that's hidden from the seat.

411
00:23:18.345 --> 00:23:20.005
And so if you can't look at the sky,

412
00:23:20.005 --> 00:23:21.245
if you can't look at the heavens

413
00:23:21.265 --> 00:23:25.365
and see evidence of God, then you're, you're missing it.

414
00:23:26.445 --> 00:23:31.085
That to another, another part of nature that reveals,

415
00:23:31.945 --> 00:23:35.485
uh, God is the complexity of the creation, right?

416
00:23:35.585 --> 00:23:38.605
So I think about all the different complexities

417
00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:41.445
of God's creation for, for, for each one of you

418
00:23:41.445 --> 00:23:43.045
that may look different, right?

419
00:23:43.185 --> 00:23:46.485
It may look like, um, a plant

420
00:23:46.485 --> 00:23:48.525
that may look like, uh, a tree.

421
00:23:48.545 --> 00:23:49.765
It might look like a hand.

422
00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:52.485
Um, many riders have written about the

423
00:23:52.485 --> 00:23:53.925
complexity of the human hand.

424
00:23:53.925 --> 00:23:56.325
And if you look at all the ligaments and tendons and muscles

425
00:23:56.425 --> 00:23:58.165
and nerves and everything, you just have

426
00:23:58.165 --> 00:24:01.005
to work together in your hand to look at a hand

427
00:24:01.185 --> 00:24:04.125
and say that, that wasn't divinely appointed.

428
00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:07.125
Created. And then we look at the power.

429
00:24:07.465 --> 00:24:10.765
We look at the power of God as evidence that he exists.

430
00:24:12.105 --> 00:24:14.685
We see the weather, we see waters, the power

431
00:24:14.685 --> 00:24:17.125
of water moving, the power of his creation.

432
00:24:17.945 --> 00:24:20.925
We see the interconnectedness of God's creation.

433
00:24:20.925 --> 00:24:24.405
That there are life cycles, life cycles in nature, right?

434
00:24:24.755 --> 00:24:27.125
Life cycles in seasons that occur,

435
00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:31.285
and that that's evidence of a divine creator.

436
00:24:31.425 --> 00:24:32.845
And then we see beauty, right?

437
00:24:33.195 --> 00:24:34.645
That all these things could have been made

438
00:24:34.645 --> 00:24:36.565
and everything could have been brown, right?

439
00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:40.805
But it's not right. Uh, or everything could have been made.

440
00:24:40.805 --> 00:24:43.045
Everything worked perfectly except everything's flat,

441
00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:44.845
but it's not right.

442
00:24:44.845 --> 00:24:46.405
There are mountains and valleys

443
00:24:46.405 --> 00:24:49.445
and there's, uh, there's beauty all around this

444
00:24:49.445 --> 00:24:51.525
that God has given us, not only for our good

445
00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:54.125
and for our enjoyment, but to, but because he could.

446
00:24:54.335 --> 00:24:57.685
Right? Uh, and and it doesn't just happen by accident

447
00:24:57.705 --> 00:25:00.645
and it's intricate and it's grand and it's delightful.

448
00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:04.445
And it calls us in to this idea of a creator.

449
00:25:05.385 --> 00:25:07.725
And then in Genesis, we see, we see humans.

450
00:25:07.825 --> 00:25:10.645
We see man as the pinnacle of God's creation.

451
00:25:11.265 --> 00:25:14.045
And not only are we kind of the pinnacle

452
00:25:14.045 --> 00:25:17.205
of physical creation with, with an integrated structure

453
00:25:17.505 --> 00:25:20.965
of our bodies from all the organ systems that work together,

454
00:25:22.105 --> 00:25:23.845
but woven into that is a soul

455
00:25:24.705 --> 00:25:27.205
and woven into that is a mind

456
00:25:27.345 --> 00:25:30.005
and woven into that is a will

457
00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:32.485
that God has uniquely created

458
00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:35.325
and put an image, put a portion of his image

459
00:25:35.605 --> 00:25:37.925
of himself inside of us.

460
00:25:38.905 --> 00:25:41.085
And we have tastes, we have little, little tastes

461
00:25:41.085 --> 00:25:44.565
of his attributes in us as we are little images of Him.

462
00:25:45.265 --> 00:25:49.005
And so we in a way are in evidence of God in this world.

463
00:25:49.505 --> 00:25:50.645
And that's, that's so beautiful.

464
00:25:51.305 --> 00:25:55.845
But, but that realization that the way that we can see that

465
00:25:56.785 --> 00:25:59.765
as followers of Christ is different

466
00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:04.365
'cause we have that failed pull apart.

467
00:26:05.195 --> 00:26:07.725
It's different than those who still are

468
00:26:07.725 --> 00:26:08.965
walking in brokenness.

469
00:26:09.315 --> 00:26:13.935
Because in our, in our redemption

470
00:26:14.475 --> 00:26:17.815
and our rebirth, we receive the spirit that allows us

471
00:26:17.815 --> 00:26:19.415
to see things differently, allows us

472
00:26:19.415 --> 00:26:21.615
to appreciate creation in a different

473
00:26:21.615 --> 00:26:22.975
and very beautiful way.

474
00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:26.415
But God restores our ability to see him in all things

475
00:26:26.955 --> 00:26:29.495
and to proclaim the excellencies of his creation.

476
00:26:30.395 --> 00:26:32.735
And I was thinking several years ago, we had a,

477
00:26:32.735 --> 00:26:34.215
we had a memory verse with a sermon series

478
00:26:34.275 --> 00:26:35.495
of First Peter two, nine.

479
00:26:36.195 --> 00:26:38.175
Do you mind know first Peter two nine? Do you remember it?

480
00:26:39.675 --> 00:26:41.215
No. I put it in my notes and I can read it.

481
00:26:41.215 --> 00:26:42.855
Brenda knows it. What is it?

482
00:26:43.575 --> 00:26:46.605
Juror of chosen race, A royal priesthood, a holy nation

483
00:26:46.985 --> 00:26:49.525
of people from his own possession that he claim

484
00:26:53.955 --> 00:26:56.445
Into marvelous life, just like Chris Thomas.

485
00:26:57.465 --> 00:27:00.885
And so he has called us out darkness. It's in that darkness.

486
00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:04.165
So we can't fully appreciate the magnificence

487
00:27:04.305 --> 00:27:05.325
of his creation.

488
00:27:05.325 --> 00:27:08.365
We can't fully appreciate the existence

489
00:27:08.365 --> 00:27:10.925
of God apart from him calling us out,

490
00:27:10.935 --> 00:27:12.725
apart from him shining his light in,

491
00:27:13.145 --> 00:27:15.005
if then he doesn't leave us there, right?

492
00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:18.005
He doesn't. He, he uses us as an example.

493
00:27:18.015 --> 00:27:20.085
We're called to proclaim the excellences.

494
00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:23.085
I love that phrase. Proclaim the excellencies of him.

495
00:27:24.545 --> 00:27:27.405
And Gruden, Gruden, GRU, in his book, the Big thick book

496
00:27:27.405 --> 00:27:29.005
that's right over there, if he writes this, he says,

497
00:27:29.095 --> 00:27:32.205
everything that exists gives, gives evidence

498
00:27:32.225 --> 00:27:33.325
of God's existence.

499
00:27:33.765 --> 00:27:37.805
I think about that. Everything that exists gives evidence

500
00:27:37.825 --> 00:27:41.245
of God's existence for those who have eyes to see

501
00:27:41.865 --> 00:27:43.965
and evaluate the evidence correctly.

502
00:27:45.015 --> 00:27:48.165
Every leaf on every tree, every blade of grass,

503
00:27:48.735 --> 00:27:49.925
every star in the sky,

504
00:27:50.065 --> 00:27:52.365
and every part of all creation, cry out.

505
00:27:52.865 --> 00:27:57.045
God made me, God made me, God made me. That's right.

506
00:27:57.465 --> 00:28:01.205
So from the trees to the flowers, every we can see it,

507
00:28:01.385 --> 00:28:02.925
we can see it 'cause our eyes are open

508
00:28:03.345 --> 00:28:05.245
and we're called to proclaim those excellences.

509
00:28:06.865 --> 00:28:09.405
And of course, we see evidence of God in scripture, right?

510
00:28:09.905 --> 00:28:12.085
So we just spent two weeks talking about the foundation

511
00:28:12.085 --> 00:28:14.565
that the word of God is the foundation

512
00:28:14.865 --> 00:28:17.125
for our understanding of God.

513
00:28:17.745 --> 00:28:20.405
And every chapter, every book, every verse

514
00:28:20.985 --> 00:28:23.205
is predicated on God's existence.

515
00:28:23.705 --> 00:28:25.565
And we see that from Genesis chapter one,

516
00:28:25.565 --> 00:28:27.365
because it begins with the works of God.

517
00:28:27.985 --> 00:28:31.365
And you can't have actions without existence, right?

518
00:28:32.385 --> 00:28:34.165
Car can't drive if it doesn't exist.

519
00:28:34.305 --> 00:28:36.285
God can't create if he doesn't exist.

520
00:28:36.345 --> 00:28:37.645
So God can't make the heavens

521
00:28:37.645 --> 00:28:38.885
and the earth if he doesn't exist.

522
00:28:39.425 --> 00:28:42.525
So the very exist, the very actions of God

523
00:28:43.235 --> 00:28:44.685
tell us about his existence.

524
00:28:45.625 --> 00:28:48.085
And then our preface last week on the a errancy award

525
00:28:48.085 --> 00:28:51.325
of God means that his existence is foundation to scripture.

526
00:28:51.905 --> 00:28:54.285
And scripture is foundational. His existence.

527
00:28:54.835 --> 00:28:58.605
What do I mean by that? Well, that scripture,

528
00:28:59.065 --> 00:29:00.045
all the things we learned about

529
00:29:00.045 --> 00:29:01.245
over the last two weeks, right?

530
00:29:01.585 --> 00:29:05.325
The inerrancy of scripture, the, the sustenance of scripture

531
00:29:05.435 --> 00:29:09.925
through the millennia, through centuries is evidence of God.

532
00:29:10.155 --> 00:29:13.245
He's doing that work. And so he's evidenced in his word.

533
00:29:14.505 --> 00:29:17.525
And so then we come to this last section, these proofs

534
00:29:17.525 --> 00:29:19.125
for the existence of God.

535
00:29:19.665 --> 00:29:21.285
And so these are some fancy words

536
00:29:21.465 --> 00:29:24.805
and uh, had to learn some new words.

537
00:29:25.265 --> 00:29:26.765
And, uh, and then these,

538
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.245
but these are, these are kind of four

539
00:29:28.305 --> 00:29:29.485
and there are more in this last section,

540
00:29:29.545 --> 00:29:30.805
and we'll read through these really

541
00:29:30.805 --> 00:29:31.925
quickly and then jump to that last.

542
00:29:31.945 --> 00:29:34.045
But it says, proofs for the existence of God.

543
00:29:34.065 --> 00:29:37.205
So first is the, what's called the cosmological proof.

544
00:29:38.145 --> 00:29:39.525
So that every, the, the idea

545
00:29:39.525 --> 00:29:43.165
behind this is every known thing has a cause, right?

546
00:29:43.185 --> 00:29:45.125
So there's a, if something's happening, it's

547
00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:47.325
because something caused it to happen.

548
00:29:48.265 --> 00:29:50.365
And so that we live in a great universe, right?

549
00:29:50.365 --> 00:29:52.525
We can look outside, we can stand on the porch

550
00:29:52.525 --> 00:29:55.245
with our buddy and say, that's a great universe, right?

551
00:29:55.985 --> 00:29:57.805
And if there's a great universe, it's

552
00:29:57.805 --> 00:29:59.685
because of a great creator.

553
00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:02.445
That's the argument, the cosmological universe.

554
00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:04.765
The next is the teleological argument.

555
00:30:04.765 --> 00:30:08.485
It says, design gives evidence of intelligent purpose.

556
00:30:09.385 --> 00:30:13.405
So that's the argument that would say, okay, if you find the

557
00:30:14.085 --> 00:30:15.485
quintessential, as you find the wrist watch

558
00:30:15.485 --> 00:30:16.565
laying on the beach, right?

559
00:30:17.105 --> 00:30:18.205
You pick up that watch

560
00:30:18.205 --> 00:30:20.645
and say, man, that watch didn't get there by accident.

561
00:30:20.965 --> 00:30:22.325
Somebody had to make that watch, right?

562
00:30:22.945 --> 00:30:27.885
And, uh, and a watch is a very finite, but very intricate,

563
00:30:27.885 --> 00:30:29.165
but also a limited thing.

564
00:30:30.345 --> 00:30:32.885
So to look at all the other creation, like I said,

565
00:30:33.025 --> 00:30:37.725
and see that the, the design of purposeful design

566
00:30:37.785 --> 00:30:40.145
of it, that the end goal

567
00:30:40.165 --> 00:30:43.025
or purpose of a thing is evidence of the purpose behind it.

568
00:30:43.025 --> 00:30:44.705
And it can only have purpose if we God

569
00:30:45.565 --> 00:30:47.865
who created all things.

570
00:30:48.695 --> 00:30:50.585
Next is the ontological argument.

571
00:30:51.135 --> 00:30:52.145
This is very interesting

572
00:30:52.695 --> 00:30:55.585
that God is a beam greater than which

573
00:30:55.585 --> 00:30:56.745
nothing can be a match.

574
00:30:57.335 --> 00:31:01.465
Okay? So we're gonna say if, if there is a God, God is,

575
00:31:01.645 --> 00:31:04.545
God is greater than everything to say capital G God.

576
00:31:04.605 --> 00:31:05.745
God is greater than everything.

577
00:31:06.925 --> 00:31:10.065
And if God is greater than everything, then God must exist.

578
00:31:10.215 --> 00:31:14.145
Because to exist is greater than not existing, right?

579
00:31:14.685 --> 00:31:17.305
So if, if you wanna make another

580
00:31:17.545 --> 00:31:19.425
argument, I only have to help you.

581
00:31:19.805 --> 00:31:22.145
So if, if a thing is greater,

582
00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:23.505
it's gonna be the greatest thing.

583
00:31:23.595 --> 00:31:25.505
God's gonna be the greatest of whatever thing it is.

584
00:31:26.045 --> 00:31:28.145
And if you have two options to not exist,

585
00:31:28.145 --> 00:31:30.345
or two exist to exist is better.

586
00:31:30.725 --> 00:31:32.225
We would agree that, yes.

587
00:31:32.485 --> 00:31:35.825
So that's the oncological argument. We can get into that.

588
00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:37.985
And then the moral argument, I love this one

589
00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:40.225
'cause the moral argument kind of speaks to our soul.

590
00:31:40.685 --> 00:31:44.945
It speaks to God, um, his, his personal breath of life kind

591
00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:46.985
of into our lives and some of the evidence of him in us.

592
00:31:47.365 --> 00:31:50.465
And the moral, moral argument is from the sense of right

593
00:31:50.465 --> 00:31:51.545
and wrong that we have.

594
00:31:52.085 --> 00:31:54.385
But there's a morality that exists.

595
00:31:54.445 --> 00:31:56.305
The CS Lewis wrote about this

596
00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:58.385
and your, your Christianity, if you read that book,

597
00:31:58.405 --> 00:31:59.425
if you have any, it's really good.

598
00:31:59.445 --> 00:32:03.105
It says, conscience reveals to us a moral law

599
00:32:03.675 --> 00:32:05.905
whose source cannot be found in the natural world.

600
00:32:07.085 --> 00:32:10.385
And it does, it points us to a supernatural law giver.

601
00:32:10.965 --> 00:32:12.945
So the fact that we have this innate sense of right

602
00:32:12.945 --> 00:32:15.745
and wrong, we have a sense of justice that's in us

603
00:32:15.845 --> 00:32:20.545
as people is evidence of a God who is moral and just,

604
00:32:21.325 --> 00:32:23.345
and there are several other men throughout years,

605
00:32:23.345 --> 00:32:26.985
one named Johnson Newman, who made the point kind

606
00:32:26.985 --> 00:32:28.385
of expand on it and says

607
00:32:28.385 --> 00:32:30.785
that even we see in man an extension of

608
00:32:30.785 --> 00:32:32.065
that moral law living by

609
00:32:32.065 --> 00:32:33.825
that moral law even when it's not in our

610
00:32:33.825 --> 00:32:34.985
best interest, right?

611
00:32:35.525 --> 00:32:38.065
So, uh, uh, an animal might do

612
00:32:38.065 --> 00:32:39.925
what is always in its best interest

613
00:32:40.165 --> 00:32:42.765
'cause they don't have a, a moral inclination, right?

614
00:32:43.225 --> 00:32:45.445
But our moral inclination in ourselves

615
00:32:45.545 --> 00:32:48.285
to do what's right even when it doesn't benefit me at

616
00:32:48.285 --> 00:32:49.365
all, right?

617
00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:55.005
That is evidence of God, a God who is creator,

618
00:32:55.385 --> 00:32:57.085
who is perfect in loving.

619
00:32:58.285 --> 00:33:02.065
And so Gruden goes on to make the, he makes the argument,

620
00:33:02.245 --> 00:33:05.905
uh, in his book, that departure from these,

621
00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.225
uh, arguments

622
00:33:08.225 --> 00:33:10.905
or from these proofs doesn't indicate

623
00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:11.905
that the proofs aren't valid,

624
00:33:11.965 --> 00:33:13.985
but rather proves that there's false assumptions

625
00:33:13.985 --> 00:33:15.545
or incorrect reasoning, meaning.

626
00:33:15.885 --> 00:33:18.265
So somebody argues with this, it it is

627
00:33:18.265 --> 00:33:20.785
because their, their heart is not able to see,

628
00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:23.585
or they're starting from, from a bad position.

629
00:33:24.325 --> 00:33:27.785
So let's jump over real quick, um, to these,

630
00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:28.945
to these Thomas a clients,

631
00:33:28.945 --> 00:33:30.225
because I, I stumbled upon these,

632
00:33:30.265 --> 00:33:31.585
I were like proofs of God existence.

633
00:33:31.585 --> 00:33:34.785
So the first wave of motion, so these are kind of extensions

634
00:33:34.965 --> 00:33:37.065
of some of these same, same arguments,

635
00:33:37.085 --> 00:33:39.665
but this is the first one he, he wrote about.

636
00:33:40.245 --> 00:33:42.985
And so it was, his arguments are these all bodies are either

637
00:33:42.985 --> 00:33:45.265
potentially motion or actually motion.

638
00:33:46.005 --> 00:33:47.785
And, and you have to be in either one that

639
00:33:47.845 --> 00:33:50.105
to be reduced from potentiality to actuality,

640
00:33:50.845 --> 00:33:52.425
except something in actuality.

641
00:33:52.485 --> 00:33:53.985
So it sounds like physics, right?

642
00:33:54.495 --> 00:33:58.345
Nothing can be at once actuality and potentiality.

643
00:33:58.445 --> 00:33:59.625
It has to be one or the other.

644
00:34:00.725 --> 00:34:04.545
And so, um, nothing can be at once, both actuality

645
00:34:04.545 --> 00:34:06.265
and potentiality with respect to motion.

646
00:34:06.845 --> 00:34:09.065
And so therefore nothing can move by itself,

647
00:34:09.725 --> 00:34:12.505
but it must be put into motion by something else.

648
00:34:13.295 --> 00:34:15.705
Okay? So there's the idea of something's moving,

649
00:34:15.705 --> 00:34:17.505
something had to put it in motion.

650
00:34:18.045 --> 00:34:20.185
And so our universe is in motion,

651
00:34:21.165 --> 00:34:23.465
so we must say someone put that in motion.

652
00:34:24.645 --> 00:34:26.985
Number six is if there were no first mover,

653
00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:29.425
there would be no motion number seven.

654
00:34:29.725 --> 00:34:31.705
But there is motion. So we can look around.

655
00:34:31.705 --> 00:34:33.825
That's a, that's like an observable fact, right?

656
00:34:33.995 --> 00:34:36.945
There is motion, therefore there must be a first mover.

657
00:34:37.005 --> 00:34:39.025
So it'd be like a first mover argument.

658
00:34:39.445 --> 00:34:43.705
So there is God, the second argument that, uh,

659
00:34:43.705 --> 00:34:47.025
Thomas Quins makes is that of efficient cause, okay?

660
00:34:48.525 --> 00:34:50.785
And it says nothing is the efficient

661
00:34:50.885 --> 00:34:53.505
or nothing is affected by itself.

662
00:34:53.505 --> 00:34:55.625
Nothing is the efficient cause of itself.

663
00:34:56.085 --> 00:34:59.665
So if a, is the cause of B, if A is absent,

664
00:34:59.665 --> 00:35:02.745
then B is also absent you on that.

665
00:35:02.745 --> 00:35:06.585
It took me three times to read. So if,

666
00:35:06.685 --> 00:35:10.025
if A makes B, if there's no A, there's no B, alright?

667
00:35:11.045 --> 00:35:12.905
And so if there is no first cause,

668
00:35:12.905 --> 00:35:14.425
there can be no ultimate effect.

669
00:35:14.965 --> 00:35:17.945
But there are effects, there are things that are happening.

670
00:35:18.035 --> 00:35:19.145
There is creation.

671
00:35:19.965 --> 00:35:22.625
And so there must be a first cause of all of those things.

672
00:35:22.685 --> 00:35:26.145
And that first cause is got, there had to be something

673
00:35:26.175 --> 00:35:27.905
that kicked all this stuff off, right?

674
00:35:28.765 --> 00:35:30.545
So that's the argument of a fishing policy.

675
00:35:31.445 --> 00:35:33.265
The third proof of God that he puts out is

676
00:35:33.265 --> 00:35:35.665
that a possibility and necessity.

677
00:35:36.085 --> 00:35:37.765
So these get a little bit trickier,

678
00:35:38.705 --> 00:35:40.005
but you may have to read it more as you get,

679
00:35:40.005 --> 00:35:41.005
I'll read it here four more times.

680
00:35:41.425 --> 00:35:44.525
He says, we find in nature of things that are possible to be

681
00:35:45.105 --> 00:35:48.575
and not to be, okay, contingent beings,

682
00:35:48.785 --> 00:35:52.335
everything is either necessary or contingent.

683
00:35:54.135 --> 00:35:58.535
Assuming that everything is contingent, it is possible

684
00:35:58.555 --> 00:36:00.735
for contingent beings always to exist for

685
00:36:00.735 --> 00:36:03.375
that which cannot be at some time is not.

686
00:36:05.365 --> 00:36:07.495
Therefore by three and four at one time there was

687
00:36:07.495 --> 00:36:09.735
nothing, okay?

688
00:36:10.315 --> 00:36:12.895
And that which does not exist against to exist only

689
00:36:12.895 --> 00:36:14.735
through something already existing.

690
00:36:14.735 --> 00:36:17.215
So this is where it kind of gets good with creation, right?

691
00:36:17.805 --> 00:36:20.215
That which does not exist begins to exist only

692
00:36:20.215 --> 00:36:21.895
through something already existing.

693
00:36:22.835 --> 00:36:24.415
So therefore, if you take five and six

694
00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:26.975
and put 'em together, then you come to the logical,

695
00:36:27.195 --> 00:36:28.215
but there is nothing now.

696
00:36:28.315 --> 00:36:29.975
So if there's nothing that started this thing off

697
00:36:29.975 --> 00:36:32.415
and there's nothing now, well that's not very,

698
00:36:32.725 --> 00:36:35.815
that doesn't make any sense because we get to seven and

699
00:36:35.875 --> 00:36:37.735
or get to eight and eight says what?

700
00:36:38.665 --> 00:36:39.855
There is something now.

701
00:36:40.035 --> 00:36:42.735
So if we, if we believe eight is true, we look around

702
00:36:42.735 --> 00:36:44.175
and we say there is something now

703
00:36:45.325 --> 00:36:46.655
Brad says, yes, there is something.

704
00:36:46.655 --> 00:36:47.935
Now there's grass outside,

705
00:36:47.935 --> 00:36:49.135
there are trees, there is something.

706
00:36:49.195 --> 00:36:51.615
Now then those other things are not true.

707
00:36:52.085 --> 00:36:54.295
Therefore number three is false, right?

708
00:36:54.505 --> 00:36:56.095
Everything is not contingent.

709
00:36:56.095 --> 00:36:57.135
Some things are necessary,

710
00:36:57.685 --> 00:37:01.175
therefore there is a necessary being that sort

711
00:37:01.175 --> 00:37:03.055
of the necessary being is God.

712
00:37:03.155 --> 00:37:06.455
So basically the argument he's making that is out

713
00:37:06.455 --> 00:37:07.815
of all things that are possible, there had

714
00:37:07.815 --> 00:37:09.095
to be one necessary thing.

715
00:37:09.095 --> 00:37:11.015
Everything had to start from something

716
00:37:11.595 --> 00:37:13.655
and that something is God.

717
00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:18.095
God is the only being that fulfills all

718
00:37:18.095 --> 00:37:20.335
of those other things that can be necessary in the

719
00:37:20.575 --> 00:37:21.655
creation of everything else.

720
00:37:23.195 --> 00:37:26.135
You guys are gonna have some good reading. Okay?

721
00:37:26.835 --> 00:37:29.815
The fourth is radiation. So I like this one.

722
00:37:30.005 --> 00:37:31.975
There's a gradation to be found in things.

723
00:37:32.005 --> 00:37:35.095
Some are better than others, okay? That's true, right?

724
00:37:35.245 --> 00:37:36.815
Some people are taller than me, lots

725
00:37:36.815 --> 00:37:37.815
of people are smarter than me.

726
00:37:38.315 --> 00:37:41.375
Things are X in proportion to how closely they resemble

727
00:37:41.375 --> 00:37:42.815
that is, which is most X.

728
00:37:43.525 --> 00:37:45.975
Okay? Who is the most bald?

729
00:37:47.475 --> 00:37:48.695
That's the paper, right?

730
00:37:49.595 --> 00:37:52.935
But there are different degrees of baldness, right? Okay.

731
00:37:53.195 --> 00:37:54.975
So that's the argument. Therefore,

732
00:37:54.975 --> 00:37:57.135
if there is nothing which is most X,

733
00:37:57.305 --> 00:37:59.935
there can be nothing which is good, okay?

734
00:38:00.475 --> 00:38:01.935
So it falls that if anything is good,

735
00:38:01.935 --> 00:38:03.775
there must be something that is most good.

736
00:38:03.955 --> 00:38:07.095
So if any attribute that you can think of, there's something

737
00:38:07.095 --> 00:38:09.975
that is the most bad thing, okay?

738
00:38:10.395 --> 00:38:11.575
If there's any happiness,

739
00:38:11.575 --> 00:38:13.055
there's something that's the most happy.

740
00:38:13.075 --> 00:38:15.175
If there's any joy, there's something that's the most joy.

741
00:38:15.635 --> 00:38:17.735
And his argument in this is if there

742
00:38:17.735 --> 00:38:18.895
is anything that is good.

743
00:38:18.995 --> 00:38:21.255
So look it for if there's anything that is good,

744
00:38:21.985 --> 00:38:24.455
there must be something that is the most good.

745
00:38:25.205 --> 00:38:29.175
Therefore there must must also be something which is

746
00:38:29.175 --> 00:38:31.855
to all beings the cause of their being, goodness

747
00:38:32.475 --> 00:38:33.695
in every other perfection.

748
00:38:33.795 --> 00:38:36.925
And this is what we call God, that God is that end

749
00:38:36.925 --> 00:38:38.125
of the road argument.

750
00:38:38.265 --> 00:38:41.085
So if there, if there is such a thing as purity,

751
00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:42.245
God is the most pure.

752
00:38:42.345 --> 00:38:44.805
If there is such a thing as love, God is the most loving.

753
00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:46.485
If there is such a thing as goodness,

754
00:38:47.185 --> 00:38:49.805
God is the highest of every single thing.

755
00:38:51.505 --> 00:38:53.765
To have a, to have a thing, you have to have most,

756
00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:55.365
you have gradation.

757
00:38:56.025 --> 00:38:57.405
And then the last is design.

758
00:38:59.065 --> 00:39:00.885
So he rights, we observe that natural bodies

759
00:39:01.545 --> 00:39:02.725
act towards an end.

760
00:39:03.465 --> 00:39:06.605
So the things in nature work towards an

761
00:39:06.605 --> 00:39:07.645
end, work towards a goal.

762
00:39:07.945 --> 00:39:10.605
And anything that acts towards an end either acts out

763
00:39:10.605 --> 00:39:13.165
of knowledge or under the direction

764
00:39:13.385 --> 00:39:14.725
of something with knowledge.

765
00:39:15.075 --> 00:39:19.065
Okay? So either a thing directs itself, okay?

766
00:39:19.925 --> 00:39:21.545
Or there's, there's knowledge

767
00:39:21.565 --> 00:39:23.145
or there's design behind the thing.

768
00:39:23.285 --> 00:39:25.065
So the example is an arrow, right?

769
00:39:25.125 --> 00:39:26.985
The arrow is directed by something that's an arrow,

770
00:39:26.985 --> 00:39:28.625
doesn't have knowledge of where it's going,

771
00:39:29.365 --> 00:39:32.745
but the arrow is directed by the archer.

772
00:39:34.845 --> 00:39:38.345
But many natural beings lack knowledge, okay?

773
00:39:38.495 --> 00:39:40.625
Therefore, some intelligent being exists

774
00:39:40.765 --> 00:39:43.465
by whom all natural things are directed to their end.

775
00:39:43.485 --> 00:39:44.785
And this being we call God.

776
00:39:45.485 --> 00:39:49.385
So that there is, because there is direction in

777
00:39:50.245 --> 00:39:53.025
the world, we look to the source of where

778
00:39:53.025 --> 00:39:54.225
that direction came from.

779
00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:55.985
And we say that direction is got.

780
00:39:57.045 --> 00:40:01.745
So these are, these are arguments that, so Aquinas,

781
00:40:02.005 --> 00:40:04.865
as Alan taught me, was, was a study of Aristotle

782
00:40:05.525 --> 00:40:08.265
and he was Aristotelian, is that correct?

783
00:40:08.905 --> 00:40:10.985
Aristotelian, I'm putting that on my bingo term, right?

784
00:40:11.245 --> 00:40:12.505
So it's Aristotelian.

785
00:40:13.285 --> 00:40:16.185
And so he's using these logical arguments, he's walking

786
00:40:16.185 --> 00:40:19.185
through this existence of God in a very logical way.

787
00:40:19.185 --> 00:40:21.305
So if you take time and kind of mentally wrestle with those,

788
00:40:21.765 --> 00:40:24.145
um, to kind of come to a little bit more about the

789
00:40:24.145 --> 00:40:25.185
existence of God, okay?

790
00:40:25.405 --> 00:40:26.945
But we're gonna jump to his knowability

791
00:40:27.805 --> 00:40:29.785
and say, I know God, right?

792
00:40:30.645 --> 00:40:32.785
Um, I wanna study a little bit more about that.

793
00:40:32.965 --> 00:40:37.145
And, and, uh, one of the, one of the places I get to teach

794
00:40:37.145 --> 00:40:38.905
and preach a lot is in our Spanish service.

795
00:40:39.205 --> 00:40:41.185
And I like that because I'll say something

796
00:40:41.445 --> 00:40:43.025
and then it gets translated in Spanish.

797
00:40:43.085 --> 00:40:45.505
And so I get to learn and experience some of the words

798
00:40:46.045 --> 00:40:48.825
and know, plus I only have to prepare half as much for the,

799
00:40:50.485 --> 00:40:53.585
but in, in Spanish, there are two words

800
00:40:53.845 --> 00:40:54.945
for the word to know.

801
00:40:55.245 --> 00:40:57.745
So to know something there too, who knows those two verbs?

802
00:40:58.805 --> 00:41:02.265
No. Say what is it? No, sir. Okay, you don't know.

803
00:41:02.265 --> 00:41:03.985
That was one of 'em. No say that's right.

804
00:41:04.525 --> 00:41:07.145
Say is a conjugate of ve, right?

805
00:41:07.525 --> 00:41:12.385
So sve is the verb, which means to know information, right?

806
00:41:13.005 --> 00:41:15.985
So, um, the other one is a verb called Kono.

807
00:41:16.565 --> 00:41:19.785
So Kono is the experiential ledge of a thing.

808
00:41:20.335 --> 00:41:23.025
Like, I've been there. I know, right?

809
00:41:23.325 --> 00:41:27.185
So I think about Wichita, right? I've never been to Wichita.

810
00:41:28.105 --> 00:41:30.345
I know about Wichita and I know it exists.

811
00:41:30.505 --> 00:41:33.645
I know if you go on I 35 and drive 150 miles or

812
00:41:33.645 --> 00:41:35.085
however far it is, you can get to Wichita.

813
00:41:35.185 --> 00:41:37.725
So you'll say Wichita, right?

814
00:41:38.065 --> 00:41:40.285
That's like a, that's like a meat.

815
00:41:40.505 --> 00:41:44.565
He knows I know Wichita, right? But no, no school Wichita.

816
00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:47.085
Like I've never experienced Wichita, I've never been there,

817
00:41:47.085 --> 00:41:48.205
I've never gotten out 35

818
00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:49.525
and drove up, never spent time there.

819
00:41:50.005 --> 00:41:51.485
I don't really, in the barbecue joint,

820
00:41:52.265 --> 00:41:53.925
I'm not missing anything, a zoo.

821
00:41:54.185 --> 00:41:57.045
And so, so I don't know, I don't know the back streets,

822
00:41:57.125 --> 00:41:59.405
I don't know the hangouts, but there are people

823
00:41:59.745 --> 00:42:02.165
who have come, we should know it, right?

824
00:42:02.195 --> 00:42:03.485
They know it. They've been there.

825
00:42:03.485 --> 00:42:04.565
They got the t-shirt, they ate

826
00:42:04.565 --> 00:42:05.685
the sandwich, they've been to Richmond.

827
00:42:05.985 --> 00:42:08.045
And so the saying is true with God, right?

828
00:42:08.705 --> 00:42:12.085
You can saber God, you can know things about God,

829
00:42:12.105 --> 00:42:13.765
you can know lots of facts about God.

830
00:42:15.465 --> 00:42:19.805
But what we are called to is to God, er,

831
00:42:20.225 --> 00:42:21.965
to experience and to know him.

832
00:42:22.545 --> 00:42:24.005
And that requires several things.

833
00:42:24.185 --> 00:42:25.365
And so we're gonna study about that.

834
00:42:25.365 --> 00:42:27.005
We're gonna talk a little about that. So first of all,

835
00:42:27.075 --> 00:42:29.005
knowing God requires revelation.

836
00:42:29.905 --> 00:42:32.685
So anything that we, that we learn

837
00:42:32.745 --> 00:42:34.405
or we know about God, think about this.

838
00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:37.005
Anything that we know about God comes through revelation.

839
00:42:37.005 --> 00:42:39.885
Whether that's a sub knowledge or a sair knowledge.

840
00:42:40.345 --> 00:42:42.085
And, and the, the way that we talk about that

841
00:42:42.905 --> 00:42:45.965
is general revelation in special revelation

842
00:42:45.965 --> 00:42:48.565
or fic revelation, special revelation.

843
00:42:48.825 --> 00:42:50.965
So the general revelation, the things

844
00:42:50.965 --> 00:42:54.005
that we can know about God, we can see, uh, some

845
00:42:54.005 --> 00:42:55.925
of those logical arguments, we can maybe,

846
00:42:55.925 --> 00:42:57.325
we could see that he's creator.

847
00:42:57.505 --> 00:42:59.405
We can see the evidence of his creation.

848
00:43:00.185 --> 00:43:02.925
Um, those are the, those are the saw bear things.

849
00:43:03.265 --> 00:43:06.285
The, or the, the general revelation about God.

850
00:43:06.425 --> 00:43:07.845
That's the Roman chapter one.

851
00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:12.725
But then the, the, the that has to be revealed, right?

852
00:43:12.865 --> 00:43:16.045
We, we don't get to that naturally, always in our flesh

853
00:43:16.105 --> 00:43:18.285
so we can see it, but our, we can see it in our flesh,

854
00:43:18.285 --> 00:43:19.605
but our flesh is broken, right?

855
00:43:20.225 --> 00:43:21.285
So we need God for that.

856
00:43:21.285 --> 00:43:23.005
But also this specific

857
00:43:23.065 --> 00:43:26.285
or Sal revelation, it's experiential knowledge.

858
00:43:26.285 --> 00:43:28.605
And that only comes to relationship with Jesus Christ.

859
00:43:29.235 --> 00:43:32.765
Matthew 1127 said, no one knows the father except the son

860
00:43:33.385 --> 00:43:36.725
and anyone who the son chooses to reveal him.

861
00:43:37.265 --> 00:43:39.205
So that doesn't come through our own knowledge.

862
00:43:39.205 --> 00:43:41.285
It doesn't come through our own wisdom.

863
00:43:41.355 --> 00:43:42.805
Paul says at first Corinthians two,

864
00:43:43.065 --> 00:43:46.685
he says in second Corinthians four, that our knowledge

865
00:43:46.685 --> 00:43:50.285
of God, our how's that right?

866
00:43:52.715 --> 00:43:54.645
Yeah. Of knowledge of God

867
00:43:54.705 --> 00:43:56.565
and understanding that experiential knowledge

868
00:43:56.565 --> 00:43:58.965
of God only comes through Christ.

869
00:43:59.025 --> 00:44:00.925
He doesn't come through wisdom doesn't come through human.

870
00:44:02.405 --> 00:44:05.805
Second point, God cannot be exhaustively or fully known.

871
00:44:06.305 --> 00:44:08.125
We can't know everything about God.

872
00:44:09.025 --> 00:44:11.845
And if we could know everything about God, then it wouldn't,

873
00:44:11.865 --> 00:44:13.045
it wouldn't be God, right?

874
00:44:13.665 --> 00:44:15.045
And so he's two, great.

875
00:44:15.305 --> 00:44:17.605
And so I was thinking about people in scripture

876
00:44:17.865 --> 00:44:20.445
who in scripture, two or three that we bumped up against

877
00:44:20.445 --> 00:44:22.925
and figured out, I can't know everything about that

878
00:44:25.185 --> 00:44:26.685
Som Joe, right?

879
00:44:27.505 --> 00:44:30.925
Who else? David, right?

880
00:44:31.825 --> 00:44:34.005
He, he said, I can't, can't know everything about God.

881
00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:36.525
Psalms over and over and over where we read it.

882
00:44:36.585 --> 00:44:39.485
And Paul, right? Paul in one Corinthians two says,

883
00:44:39.505 --> 00:44:41.445
no one comprehends the things of God except

884
00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:43.125
for the spirit of God.

885
00:44:43.585 --> 00:44:47.485
And so like, we can't know everything about God.

886
00:44:48.825 --> 00:44:51.845
And and so that can kind of produce two different,

887
00:44:52.305 --> 00:44:53.725
two different reactions, right?

888
00:44:53.725 --> 00:44:56.045
It can produce a, a defeatist type reaction

889
00:44:56.045 --> 00:44:58.245
or produce a victorious type reaction.

890
00:44:58.745 --> 00:45:02.645
So I included these verses, Psalm 1 45, 1 47, and 1 39.

891
00:45:03.145 --> 00:45:05.765
So I'm gonna read the one, Psalm 1 45, 1 through six.

892
00:45:06.195 --> 00:45:07.405
This is David's response.

893
00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:11.325
He says, I will extol you, my God and king,

894
00:45:11.665 --> 00:45:14.565
and bless your name forever and ever, every day.

895
00:45:14.605 --> 00:45:16.525
I will bless you and praise your name forever and ever.

896
00:45:16.575 --> 00:45:19.165
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

897
00:45:19.165 --> 00:45:21.565
And his greatness is unsearchable.

898
00:45:22.225 --> 00:45:24.325
One generation shall come in your works to the other

899
00:45:24.545 --> 00:45:26.245
and shall declare your mighty acts

900
00:45:27.285 --> 00:45:29.205
o the glorious splendor of your majesty.

901
00:45:29.205 --> 00:45:32.765
And on your wondrous works, I will meditate.

902
00:45:33.235 --> 00:45:35.765
They shall speak of your might of your awesome deeds.

903
00:45:36.325 --> 00:45:37.965
I will declare your greatness.

904
00:45:38.305 --> 00:45:41.725
But this became a doxology, it became a praise to God.

905
00:45:42.345 --> 00:45:45.325
And so he writes of it, he says, unsearchable or God's ways,

906
00:45:45.465 --> 00:45:46.725
but what does he say he is gonna do?

907
00:45:48.635 --> 00:45:52.205
He's gonna meditate, right? He says, it's unsearchable.

908
00:45:52.205 --> 00:45:53.645
So he's saying, God can't know all this stuff,

909
00:45:53.645 --> 00:45:54.845
but I'm gonna meditate on it.

910
00:45:54.945 --> 00:45:56.845
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna work at it.

911
00:45:56.845 --> 00:45:59.845
But then also I'm gonna share, I'm gonna speak of your might

912
00:45:59.905 --> 00:46:02.045
of your awesome deeds and declare your greatness.

913
00:46:02.045 --> 00:46:05.245
So we're not, we don't walk in this unknowability

914
00:46:05.345 --> 00:46:08.525
or uns searchability in the thief and in victory.

915
00:46:09.995 --> 00:46:13.085
Okay? Romans chapter 11, verse 33 is another passage

916
00:46:13.155 --> 00:46:14.645
that speaks very beautifully to this.

917
00:46:15.385 --> 00:46:17.405
And it's another, it's a, it's a Paul.

918
00:46:17.405 --> 00:46:20.365
It's Paul reminding himself of praise.

919
00:46:20.505 --> 00:46:24.445
And if you study Romans chapter 11 a lot, it's not easy.

920
00:46:25.275 --> 00:46:28.205
It's a hard passage. And you can almost feel Paul wrestling

921
00:46:28.205 --> 00:46:29.445
with someone this as he walks through it.

922
00:46:29.665 --> 00:46:32.325
But then he reminds himself at the end of it, he says, oh,

923
00:46:32.385 --> 00:46:34.285
the depth of the riches and wisdom

924
00:46:34.465 --> 00:46:37.845
and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgments

925
00:46:37.845 --> 00:46:41.405
and how inscrutable his ways for who has known the mind

926
00:46:41.405 --> 00:46:43.205
of the Lord and who has been his counselor,

927
00:46:44.145 --> 00:46:47.485
who has given him a gift that he might be repaid or from him

928
00:46:47.585 --> 00:46:50.085
and through him and to him are all names.

929
00:46:50.625 --> 00:46:53.365
To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

930
00:46:53.905 --> 00:46:55.685
And that's Paul's doxology at the end

931
00:46:55.685 --> 00:46:58.645
of his hard teaching in Romans chapter 11, this hard writing

932
00:46:58.715 --> 00:47:00.765
that he had to do is he just,

933
00:47:00.785 --> 00:47:03.005
he finally says, I can't know it all.

934
00:47:03.005 --> 00:47:06.005
Like this is really tough and I'm not gonna know it all.

935
00:47:06.065 --> 00:47:09.005
And that's okay. 'cause God, you were greater and,

936
00:47:09.065 --> 00:47:10.805
and I'm gonna praise you in that.

937
00:47:11.825 --> 00:47:14.445
And then as I was studying this, I came across this,

938
00:47:14.595 --> 00:47:16.085
this first from Joe.

939
00:47:16.115 --> 00:47:19.325
There's one that I think grew included in his writings.

940
00:47:19.325 --> 00:47:22.045
And it, it was one that I honestly hadn't, um,

941
00:47:23.295 --> 00:47:24.405
spent much time with.

942
00:47:25.265 --> 00:47:29.750
But he says, behold, these are the outskirts of his ways.

943
00:47:30.065 --> 00:47:33.325
So he's like job's, realizing he's just skirting the edge

944
00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:35.965
of everything that has to be known about God.

945
00:47:36.105 --> 00:47:40.085
He says, how small a whisper do we hear him,

946
00:47:40.545 --> 00:47:42.085
but the thunder of his power?

947
00:47:42.345 --> 00:47:43.405
Who can understand that?

948
00:47:43.515 --> 00:47:45.605
Wait, we get to hear the whisper,

949
00:47:46.505 --> 00:47:48.685
but there's a thunder of who God is

950
00:47:48.685 --> 00:47:50.565
that we can't even begin to approach.

951
00:47:51.705 --> 00:47:56.525
And so I was thinking about, like, I, I, I,

952
00:47:57.045 --> 00:47:58.885
I think I know a lot about a few things.

953
00:47:58.955 --> 00:48:00.485
Like I know a lot about bones.

954
00:48:01.105 --> 00:48:03.525
My son knows a lot about sharks. He really liked sharks.

955
00:48:03.585 --> 00:48:05.045
So he studied all about sharks.

956
00:48:05.265 --> 00:48:07.445
He can tell you all about sharks.

957
00:48:08.025 --> 00:48:09.565
And it's fun to get together with people

958
00:48:09.565 --> 00:48:10.885
who are like experts in a thing.

959
00:48:10.885 --> 00:48:12.885
It's fun to kind of be an expert in a thing.

960
00:48:14.385 --> 00:48:15.525
And we kind of geek out, we

961
00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:16.605
call geeking out about those things.

962
00:48:16.605 --> 00:48:18.965
So you give with somebody who like in a baseball cards

963
00:48:18.985 --> 00:48:20.325
and they know a lot about baseball cards

964
00:48:20.345 --> 00:48:22.165
and you can really have a real in depth discussion

965
00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:23.525
about baseball cards, right?

966
00:48:24.985 --> 00:48:26.925
But all those subjects, in reality,

967
00:48:27.105 --> 00:48:28.565
you can get to the end of the thing.

968
00:48:29.155 --> 00:48:30.295
You can get to the end of the thing,

969
00:48:30.555 --> 00:48:33.455
but with God, you can't get to the end of the thing, right?

970
00:48:33.835 --> 00:48:36.135
And so how good is it that we can get together

971
00:48:36.715 --> 00:48:39.495
and geek out on the study and the knowledge of God, right?

972
00:48:39.495 --> 00:48:41.655
That we, we, we, we can,

973
00:48:41.875 --> 00:48:43.895
we can be intimidated by it, by so great.

974
00:48:43.895 --> 00:48:48.015
But then it's, it's an infinite amount of, of experiences

975
00:48:48.115 --> 00:48:50.975
for us to explore as we know them more and more and more.

976
00:48:50.975 --> 00:48:53.055
And it's enjoyable to get to do that.

977
00:48:53.085 --> 00:48:55.255
It's enjoyable to become an expert in those things.

978
00:48:56.195 --> 00:48:57.575
Um, at, at Texas a

979
00:48:57.575 --> 00:48:59.975
and m, we had a, a Tuesday night gathering that was called,

980
00:49:00.475 --> 00:49:03.375
um, uh, can't remember what it was called.

981
00:49:03.555 --> 00:49:05.055
It was really cool. We wish we

982
00:49:05.255 --> 00:49:07.775
receivers, we wish we were receivers.

983
00:49:07.775 --> 00:49:08.855
It was called Midnight Yell Practice.

984
00:49:10.395 --> 00:49:12.095
But the, but the, the guy who taught

985
00:49:12.095 --> 00:49:13.175
that was gonna have Greg Mot.

986
00:49:13.275 --> 00:49:15.175
And so he told us one time he told us the story.

987
00:49:15.195 --> 00:49:16.455
He was teaching us some of this argument,

988
00:49:16.475 --> 00:49:19.055
but he was, he was explaining it with a game

989
00:49:19.055 --> 00:49:20.055
that he would play with himself.

990
00:49:20.055 --> 00:49:21.255
And so when he was walking through nature,

991
00:49:21.255 --> 00:49:23.655
when he was hiking, he would look at a thing and,

992
00:49:23.835 --> 00:49:26.455
and appreciate it towards greatness and his grander and say,

993
00:49:26.595 --> 00:49:28.015
but God, you're greater than that thing.

994
00:49:28.505 --> 00:49:29.935
Right? God, you're greater than that.

995
00:49:30.035 --> 00:49:31.935
So that mountain, that mountain is really high.

996
00:49:32.275 --> 00:49:34.215
I'm looking at Pikes Peak Pike Peaks really great.

997
00:49:34.235 --> 00:49:36.615
Got notice on top of God, you are greater than Pikes Peak,

998
00:49:36.995 --> 00:49:38.695
or I'm standing on the shore of the Pacific Ocean.

999
00:49:38.995 --> 00:49:40.215
I'm looking out over the Pacific Ocean.

1000
00:49:40.215 --> 00:49:43.015
Those waves are really big and the ocean's really broad,

1001
00:49:43.155 --> 00:49:45.215
but God, you are bigger than that ocean.

1002
00:49:45.915 --> 00:49:50.095
And so we remember that, that he is, he's so big

1003
00:49:50.115 --> 00:49:54.015
and so massive and it can get, it can get, uh, a lot for us.

1004
00:49:54.275 --> 00:49:57.935
But we also remember that God reveals just the right that

1005
00:49:57.995 --> 00:50:00.175
for us at every, at every moment, right?

1006
00:50:00.235 --> 00:50:02.255
His revelation for us is sufficient.

1007
00:50:02.755 --> 00:50:04.055
And it's also just right.

1008
00:50:04.515 --> 00:50:05.935
Um, when I was in medical school, I worked

1009
00:50:05.935 --> 00:50:07.335
with a pediatrician when I was early

1010
00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:09.255
and the babies, the moms would come in

1011
00:50:09.255 --> 00:50:10.255
and say, my baby's throwing up,

1012
00:50:10.255 --> 00:50:11.255
my baby's spitting up their milk

1013
00:50:11.595 --> 00:50:13.015
and they can't handle it on school.

1014
00:50:13.035 --> 00:50:14.815
How big of a audible are you trying to give your baby?

1015
00:50:14.835 --> 00:50:15.855
And it was like a little baby.

1016
00:50:15.935 --> 00:50:17.535
And they were trying to give him like an eight ounce

1017
00:50:17.535 --> 00:50:18.895
bottle of, of milk.

1018
00:50:19.315 --> 00:50:21.375
And so he had this great thing, he would take the bottle

1019
00:50:21.375 --> 00:50:23.135
and hold it up next to the baby's stomach

1020
00:50:23.875 --> 00:50:24.935
and the bottle would be like,

1021
00:50:24.935 --> 00:50:26.455
bigger than the baby's torch set, right?

1022
00:50:27.305 --> 00:50:28.805
And the baby couldn't hold all that.

1023
00:50:29.985 --> 00:50:31.725
And so they couldn't, they couldn't keep it all inside.

1024
00:50:31.725 --> 00:50:35.045
But God knows exactly how much we can handle

1025
00:50:35.425 --> 00:50:36.725
of him, right?

1026
00:50:37.265 --> 00:50:38.845
How much we think about Moses, right?

1027
00:50:38.845 --> 00:50:41.085
When Moses said, God, I want to see all your glory.

1028
00:50:41.425 --> 00:50:42.805
God said, you ain't ready for that, bro.

1029
00:50:43.865 --> 00:50:45.685
He said, here's a, here's a little clip.

1030
00:50:45.705 --> 00:50:47.445
Do you hide in that clip? And I'm gonna, I'm gonna,

1031
00:50:47.465 --> 00:50:51.125
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna do a drive by and turn right.

1032
00:50:51.545 --> 00:50:53.605
And, and so God knows how much we can handle

1033
00:50:53.625 --> 00:50:54.965
and he gives us just the right amount

1034
00:50:56.215 --> 00:50:58.795
and even more than than that of knowing God

1035
00:50:58.865 --> 00:50:59.875
that we can't know everything.

1036
00:51:00.295 --> 00:51:02.635
The next, the next kind of point is what we can know,

1037
00:51:02.695 --> 00:51:04.275
God truly right?

1038
00:51:04.775 --> 00:51:07.235
We, we, we kind of understand. We can't know him fully.

1039
00:51:07.375 --> 00:51:10.115
We can't know everything about God because he's infinite.

1040
00:51:10.655 --> 00:51:13.075
But we can't know him truly. So what do I mean by that?

1041
00:51:13.955 --> 00:51:15.995
Scripture is our true representation

1042
00:51:16.175 --> 00:51:17.715
of God's just the right amount.

1043
00:51:17.825 --> 00:51:19.515
It's objective, it's written by his hand

1044
00:51:19.515 --> 00:51:20.555
that we've studied not.

1045
00:51:20.895 --> 00:51:22.715
And that God's word is the surest

1046
00:51:22.715 --> 00:51:24.355
and truest expression of who he is.

1047
00:51:24.975 --> 00:51:27.195
And for all the reasons that we talked about over the last

1048
00:51:27.195 --> 00:51:28.395
two weeks, that's our avenue.

1049
00:51:28.455 --> 00:51:30.275
That's our glimpse into who God is.

1050
00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:36.555
And in, um, in, in Exodus 34, verse 6, 2 7, it says,

1051
00:51:36.555 --> 00:51:38.915
the Lord, this is, this is Moses when he says he wanted

1052
00:51:38.915 --> 00:51:41.475
to see God, and the Lord passed by before him.

1053
00:51:41.575 --> 00:51:43.035
And this is God's proclamation.

1054
00:51:43.775 --> 00:51:45.835
It says, I'm the Lord, the Lord.

1055
00:51:45.995 --> 00:51:49.835
A God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding

1056
00:51:49.835 --> 00:51:50.955
and steadfast love

1057
00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:55.275
and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands,

1058
00:51:55.295 --> 00:51:57.795
for giving iniquity and transgression and sin.

1059
00:51:58.935 --> 00:52:00.275
But Whoah, who will

1060
00:52:00.335 --> 00:52:02.515
by no means swear the guilty visiting the,

1061
00:52:02.895 --> 00:52:04.875
the fathers on the children, the children's children

1062
00:52:05.285 --> 00:52:06.985
to the third and the fourth generation.

1063
00:52:07.685 --> 00:52:11.745
And so in scripture, we have the ability to know God truly.

1064
00:52:12.325 --> 00:52:13.505
And every glimpse that we have,

1065
00:52:13.505 --> 00:52:15.785
if we see God is love, then guess what?

1066
00:52:16.615 --> 00:52:18.185
He's always gonna be loved.

1067
00:52:18.205 --> 00:52:19.665
And if we know that God is holy,

1068
00:52:19.885 --> 00:52:21.785
he is holy to the nth degree.

1069
00:52:21.785 --> 00:52:24.625
And so we get these little, these digestible

1070
00:52:25.555 --> 00:52:29.305
doses in scripture knowing that there's not more,

1071
00:52:29.495 --> 00:52:31.025
there's not something insidious

1072
00:52:31.025 --> 00:52:33.865
or different beyond that we're gonna learn in future, right?

1073
00:52:34.145 --> 00:52:36.985
'cause we know that, that God is fully true to himself.

1074
00:52:37.605 --> 00:52:38.625
He says that in his word.

1075
00:52:38.625 --> 00:52:39.865
And we see him prove himself over

1076
00:52:39.865 --> 00:52:41.465
and over again through the pages of scripture.

1077
00:52:42.895 --> 00:52:46.985
Next is we can know God personally. So we have this idea.

1078
00:52:46.985 --> 00:52:48.025
We can't know him fully.

1079
00:52:48.085 --> 00:52:49.665
We can know him truly in the scripture.

1080
00:52:49.725 --> 00:52:51.065
We can know objectively.

1081
00:52:51.065 --> 00:52:52.985
We can know what's right and what's not right about God.

1082
00:52:52.985 --> 00:52:55.385
But we also get the opportunity to know him personally

1083
00:52:56.815 --> 00:52:58.265
through connection through Christ,

1084
00:52:58.455 --> 00:53:00.505
through the revelation of the Holy Spirit.

1085
00:53:01.055 --> 00:53:03.145
That through the Holy Spirit we have this personal,

1086
00:53:03.425 --> 00:53:07.265
intimate relationship with God that Paul talks about.

1087
00:53:07.265 --> 00:53:09.065
Ephesians chapter one, right?

1088
00:53:09.765 --> 00:53:12.465
Um, in verse in verse 15 through 20, it says,

1089
00:53:12.465 --> 00:53:14.665
for this reason, I've heard your faith in the Lord Jesus

1090
00:53:14.665 --> 00:53:17.505
Christ, for all the saints, I do not cease to give thanks

1091
00:53:17.505 --> 00:53:19.265
to you for remembering me and my prayers.

1092
00:53:20.765 --> 00:53:24.785
And then, uh, later down the road, he says, um,

1093
00:53:24.785 --> 00:53:26.485
that you may know what is the hope

1094
00:53:26.485 --> 00:53:27.925
to which he has called you?

1095
00:53:28.585 --> 00:53:30.285
And what are the riches of his glorious

1096
00:53:30.285 --> 00:53:31.605
inheritance in all the saints?

1097
00:53:31.905 --> 00:53:33.525
And what is the immeasurable greatness

1098
00:53:33.525 --> 00:53:36.845
of his power toward us who believe according to the working

1099
00:53:36.865 --> 00:53:38.525
of his great mind, that we work in Christ

1100
00:53:38.525 --> 00:53:39.685
Jesus, that he raised from the dead.

1101
00:53:40.355 --> 00:53:43.805
That in Christ we have this personal relationship with God,

1102
00:53:43.805 --> 00:53:45.725
that we can have our own experiences,

1103
00:53:45.745 --> 00:53:49.045
but understand everything that we, there's a personal

1104
00:53:50.015 --> 00:53:51.725
experience with God is gonna line

1105
00:53:51.725 --> 00:53:52.845
up perfectly with scripture.

1106
00:53:52.975 --> 00:53:54.405
Right? It's that idea that God

1107
00:53:55.975 --> 00:53:57.685
won't reveal anything to us personally.

1108
00:53:57.685 --> 00:54:00.205
That's counter to his work. That's who he is.

1109
00:54:00.235 --> 00:54:03.685
He's consistent. And so we're called

1110
00:54:03.685 --> 00:54:05.605
to a closer personal relationship in prayer.

1111
00:54:05.655 --> 00:54:07.605
James chapter four says, draw near to God

1112
00:54:07.605 --> 00:54:08.765
and he will draw near to you.

1113
00:54:09.625 --> 00:54:12.735
And in John chapter 14, we get the idea

1114
00:54:12.735 --> 00:54:14.615
of God making his home with us.

1115
00:54:15.355 --> 00:54:17.495
And then, um, Christ has, has the teaching

1116
00:54:17.495 --> 00:54:21.095
of abiding in Christ through prayer that we can abide him

1117
00:54:21.115 --> 00:54:22.135
and we can know him,

1118
00:54:22.555 --> 00:54:24.735
but we can only know God through Jesus Christ.

1119
00:54:24.905 --> 00:54:26.415
Right? That's the only way.

1120
00:54:26.515 --> 00:54:28.375
That's the only way we can con stare at him.

1121
00:54:28.695 --> 00:54:31.055
'cause he tore that veil from top to bottom.

1122
00:54:31.155 --> 00:54:33.495
And that's, that's where the joy comes in this, right?

1123
00:54:33.555 --> 00:54:35.535
So there's, there's a lot of academia, there's a lot

1124
00:54:35.535 --> 00:54:36.895
of, a lot of study.

1125
00:54:37.315 --> 00:54:38.455
But then there's the joy

1126
00:54:38.955 --> 00:54:41.975
and the joy comes as we walk in the spirit, knowing him

1127
00:54:42.195 --> 00:54:44.135
and relating to him and relying on him.

1128
00:54:44.135 --> 00:54:46.255
And we say that, that he's given us grace.

1129
00:54:46.915 --> 00:54:49.375
God has given us grace to approach the throne of grace

1130
00:54:49.435 --> 00:54:50.615
and confidence, right?

1131
00:54:50.845 --> 00:54:53.175
That we can come to him in our times of need

1132
00:54:53.355 --> 00:54:57.095
and relate to him in a personal way to receive that, uh,

1133
00:54:57.095 --> 00:54:58.895
mercy and grace and the time of need.

1134
00:54:59.675 --> 00:55:01.815
We can ask for forgiveness. We need forgiveness.

1135
00:55:01.875 --> 00:55:03.695
We can ask for wisdom when we need wisdom.

1136
00:55:04.515 --> 00:55:08.055
And that, that promise that would come through Christ.

1137
00:55:09.155 --> 00:55:11.455
And so in all those other world religions

1138
00:55:11.455 --> 00:55:13.775
that we talked about and that we studied about spirituality

1139
00:55:13.775 --> 00:55:16.855
and medicine class, that we see

1140
00:55:16.855 --> 00:55:19.455
that all those fall short, right?

1141
00:55:19.775 --> 00:55:21.775
'cause in so many of God trying to make his way

1142
00:55:21.775 --> 00:55:23.095
to man the things that we're doing.

1143
00:55:23.235 --> 00:55:25.335
But we know that our true knowability,

1144
00:55:25.335 --> 00:55:27.135
when we think about the knowability of God,

1145
00:55:28.165 --> 00:55:29.615
that it comes through Jesus Christ.

1146
00:55:29.635 --> 00:55:31.695
It comes through that one source

1147
00:55:31.885 --> 00:55:34.415
that makes Christianity different.

1148
00:55:34.705 --> 00:55:37.135
Every other world of religion, every other expression

1149
00:55:37.135 --> 00:55:39.295
of spirituality, every other way.

1150
00:55:39.295 --> 00:55:42.175
That man has tried to build that void of God in his life.

1151
00:55:42.715 --> 00:55:44.895
Christ came to make that connection.

1152
00:55:44.895 --> 00:55:48.095
So we could have that, that deficit filled completely

1153
00:55:48.115 --> 00:55:50.875
and perfectly as our perfect propitiation

1154
00:55:50.875 --> 00:55:54.795
and perfect, um, perfect sacrifice for us.

1155
00:55:54.815 --> 00:55:57.475
And so we should appreciate that.

1156
00:55:57.475 --> 00:55:59.995
Everything that we can know about God, everything

1157
00:55:59.995 --> 00:56:02.755
that we can know about God, uh, intellectually,

1158
00:56:02.755 --> 00:56:06.075
but also everything that we can know experientially, is

1159
00:56:06.075 --> 00:56:07.315
because of the trying God,

1160
00:56:07.515 --> 00:56:10.435
'cause of God the Father through his word, God, the Son,

1161
00:56:10.435 --> 00:56:13.195
through his sacrifice of God, the spirit, his revelation.

1162
00:56:15.335 --> 00:56:17.115
So I hope that that, uh,

1163
00:56:17.285 --> 00:56:20.115
helps you guys understand the knowability of God.

1164
00:56:20.535 --> 00:56:21.675
Uh, David's gonna come

1165
00:56:21.975 --> 00:56:24.045
and have some discussion questions

1166
00:56:24.045 --> 00:56:26.085
for us when we wanna interact with some tonight.

1167
00:56:26.785 --> 00:56:30.965
And then, um, I've actually got one, one bit more,

1168
00:56:31.065 --> 00:56:32.285
but Mark's gonna close this out.

1169
00:56:32.295 --> 00:56:35.845
We're done. Okay. Alright. Thank you.

1170
00:56:35.845 --> 00:56:37.885
Tr I'm gonna get this outta the way

1171
00:56:37.885 --> 00:56:41.085
because I will end up knocking the I do not need,

1172
00:56:41.245 --> 00:56:45.245
and Mike have always been known as a dominant talker,

1173
00:56:45.305 --> 00:56:48.725
so you can probably always hear a little thing about me,

1174
00:56:48.955 --> 00:56:50.845
like trs, think a little bit about him.
