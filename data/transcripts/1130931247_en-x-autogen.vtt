WEBVTT

1
00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:19.405
Oh, welcome church.

2
00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:20.805
It's great to see you.

3
00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:22.685
Uh, last Sunday I had the privilege

4
00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:25.485
of sitting right back there and, uh, watching

5
00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:28.245
and getting to participate in Brandon.

6
00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:32.725
So aptly leading us through this series we've been walking

7
00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:34.605
through in Second Samuel, I'm so thankful for

8
00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:35.685
what God's done in his life

9
00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:39.765
and in what God is going to do in Him and through him.

10
00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:42.205
Uh, but I'm excited to be back up here

11
00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:45.405
as we continue this search for God's promised King

12
00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:47.645
in this Old Testament book.

13
00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:52.085
As we get into it today, I wanna ask you a question first.

14
00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:56.445
Have you ever faced a seemingly impossible situation?

15
00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.965
Now, I don't mean like, you know, traffic on the way

16
00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:03.405
to work in the morning or something like that's impossible.

17
00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:05.325
No, not that. I'm talking about something

18
00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:08.205
that really is overwhelming.

19
00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:11.525
We got dozens of examples in our lives.

20
00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:13.725
You could think of things like a job loss

21
00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.645
or uh, maybe family that's just falling apart around you

22
00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:23.325
or a cancer diagnosis.

23
00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.885
You know, these kind of things that just feel

24
00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:28.805
like this is impossible.

25
00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:33.465
There's no way out. Well,

26
00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:38.065
there's a scene in two Chronicles 20 where King Jehosaphat,

27
00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:39.865
which I don't know why anybody doesn't name

28
00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:40.985
their kid Jehosaphat anymore.

29
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:44.345
But anyway, uh, king Jehosaphat,

30
00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:46.705
he received horrifying news

31
00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:51.025
that this massive enemy army was coming against Judah

32
00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:53.745
and they were about 15 miles away.

33
00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:57.025
And you can imagine what's going through his head

34
00:01:57.165 --> 00:02:01.255
as his life and the entire kingdom were at risk

35
00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:03.495
of just getting wiped off the face of the earth.

36
00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:07.895
Yet instead of running away

37
00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.935
or hiding in fear, what did he do?

38
00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:15.175
He led his people to fast

39
00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:18.055
and pray, to sing,

40
00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:23.515
to praise the Lord in the face of this enemy army coming.

41
00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:28.375
And what did God do? Well, God

42
00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:32.375
cause the enemy army to turn on itself

43
00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:34.615
and basically destroy themselves to

44
00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:36.095
where the scripture says there was not

45
00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:37.335
one of them left alive.

46
00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:45.555
Now, now, what Jehosaphat did takes a measure of trust.

47
00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:49.935
Doesn't it like trust the Lord, trust

48
00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:51.855
that you're in the right, you're on his side.

49
00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:55.615
Like just trust the Lord, trust God's plan for his people.

50
00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:59.685
Trust the whole promise thing of like you had to trust God

51
00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:02.725
to do what Jehosaphat did.

52
00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:08.995
Is that how you respond when you feel surrounded

53
00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:15.625
is my first instinct in the face

54
00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:17.745
of abject terror That's coming my way,

55
00:03:19.085 --> 00:03:22.345
is my first instinct to worship.

56
00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:29.875
Well, as we look back to David's early life,

57
00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:31.515
that was his response.

58
00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:35.495
Remember, we love the David and Goliath story.

59
00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.535
Why did David know that Goliath was gonna be defeated?

60
00:03:38.535 --> 00:03:41.615
Because David could look back at God defeated this enemy

61
00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:44.855
and that animal and these things and God had worked

62
00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:46.295
and David trusted God

63
00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:47.735
and God knew David knew

64
00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:49.415
that God was gonna come through again.

65
00:03:49.515 --> 00:03:51.255
Why would he not? Right? This is, this is

66
00:03:51.255 --> 00:03:52.535
what David leaned on.

67
00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:56.775
His trust in God led him to this defeat of a giant.

68
00:03:58.795 --> 00:04:03.295
Yet over the last few weeks, we've seen David's trust begin

69
00:04:03.355 --> 00:04:07.615
to drift and it got him in a whole heap of trouble

70
00:04:09.195 --> 00:04:12.135
as he started abating responsibilities as he started

71
00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:15.295
to get in this place of sin and and dominating his life

72
00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:20.245
and all the effects of that, his trust

73
00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:24.225
that he had when he was a young man did not follow through

74
00:04:24.805 --> 00:04:25.825
as he became the king.

75
00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:30.535
Well, if you remember what Brandon shared last week in

76
00:04:30.535 --> 00:04:33.815
chapters 15 and 16, God in his grace

77
00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:36.575
and mercy sent David back to the wilderness

78
00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:40.695
because in first Samuel, the wilderness was

79
00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:43.055
where David learned how to trust God.

80
00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:48.655
It was where he saw Saul the king come

81
00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.695
after him, try to take his life away

82
00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:53.855
and he was forced to trust God even as he was running, even

83
00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:57.335
how as he was afraid for his life he was was threatened.

84
00:04:57.355 --> 00:04:59.495
And so he turned to God.

85
00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:05.635
Well, the wilderness again

86
00:05:07.585 --> 00:05:10.645
led David to draw back nearer to God,

87
00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:15.085
which led to his trust growing again.

88
00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:22.325
As we'll see in the passage today as that shows up

89
00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:25.605
as David's son Absalom taking, trying

90
00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:28.085
to take the throne away from David and, and,

91
00:05:28.085 --> 00:05:29.445
and there seemed to be no way out.

92
00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:31.365
David's in the middle of the wilderness,

93
00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:32.725
he's at the risk of his life.

94
00:05:32.785 --> 00:05:34.925
It seems like it's resetting from one Samuel.

95
00:05:35.425 --> 00:05:39.405
All of that looks like there's no way out. God made a way.

96
00:05:41.165 --> 00:05:43.875
David trusted God to make a way

97
00:05:43.895 --> 00:05:45.315
and it was God who delivered David.

98
00:05:45.415 --> 00:05:46.795
It was God who protected David.

99
00:05:46.895 --> 00:05:48.915
It was God who never left David in the middle of

100
00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:52.595
what he needed in spite of David's sin against God.

101
00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:57.035
All of that God had a plan for David's life and

102
00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.085
and David trusted him.

103
00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.275
And what we need to learn today is that

104
00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:05.235
that truth applies not only for David back then it applies

105
00:06:05.335 --> 00:06:09.875
for God's children by faith today that you

106
00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:13.195
and I can trust him just as much as David did.

107
00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:15.555
He's the same God. We can trust him.

108
00:06:15.735 --> 00:06:18.675
We can walk in that same assurance.

109
00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:23.065
That's what we're gonna see today in chapter 17

110
00:06:23.085 --> 00:06:24.585
and 18 of two Samuel.

111
00:06:24.925 --> 00:06:26.105
So if you're not there yet, go ahead

112
00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:29.705
and turn there with me two Samuel 17 and 18.

113
00:06:30.085 --> 00:06:32.185
That's where we're gonna be today

114
00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:35.105
as your attorney, lemme pray for us.

115
00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:41.945
Lord, I pray just humbly

116
00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:45.225
that this is your word.

117
00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:47.865
This is meant for us. It's not just old stories.

118
00:06:47.935 --> 00:06:50.545
This is something that you want to use living an active

119
00:06:50.565 --> 00:06:53.705
to cut deeper than any two edges sword into our souls

120
00:06:57.135 --> 00:07:00.105
that you would expose our hearts where we need it,

121
00:07:00.105 --> 00:07:01.185
convict us where we need it,

122
00:07:01.185 --> 00:07:02.785
but also God encourage us,

123
00:07:02.785 --> 00:07:04.945
give us assurance where we need it.

124
00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:11.265
And for those facing insurmountable impossible situations,

125
00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:13.305
they would see that it's you who fight the battle.

126
00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:14.745
It's you who make the way out,

127
00:07:18.885 --> 00:07:19.995
especially eternally.

128
00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:24.195
Thank you. God help us Holy Spirit, speak

129
00:07:24.195 --> 00:07:25.395
through your word today.

130
00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:27.675
In Jesus' name, amen.

131
00:07:30.695 --> 00:07:32.035
So again, at this point in the narrative

132
00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:33.235
we see that David's on the run.

133
00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:37.035
Absalom is the one who's chasing him trying

134
00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:38.795
to take over the throne and

135
00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:41.035
and again all of this is part of the fulfillment of

136
00:07:41.035 --> 00:07:42.795
what Nathan prophesied to David.

137
00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:45.395
After David's sin, Nathan said, Hey,

138
00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:46.435
your family's gonna fall apart.

139
00:07:46.435 --> 00:07:47.315
It's gonna be strife and

140
00:07:47.315 --> 00:07:48.515
there's gonna be sword never leaving.

141
00:07:48.695 --> 00:07:51.315
All of this is evidence that that's coming true.

142
00:07:54.065 --> 00:07:58.635
Well watch what happens next as Absalom determines what

143
00:07:58.635 --> 00:08:01.355
to do, David's on the run Absalom's trying to figure out

144
00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:02.435
what he's doing next.

145
00:08:02.535 --> 00:08:04.915
And so AB Absalom determines this.

146
00:08:04.915 --> 00:08:06.195
Look at verses one through four.

147
00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:12.425
Moreover, a hitha fell said to Absalom,

148
00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:15.025
let me choose 12,000 men and I will arise

149
00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:16.865
and pursue David tonight.

150
00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:20.465
I will come upon him while he was weary and discouraged

151
00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:21.505
and throw him into a panic.

152
00:08:21.965 --> 00:08:23.505
And all the people who are with him will flee.

153
00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:25.025
I'll strike down only the king

154
00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:26.625
and I'll bring all the people back to you.

155
00:08:26.685 --> 00:08:28.025
As a bride comes home to her husband.

156
00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:30.505
You seek the life of only one man

157
00:08:30.525 --> 00:08:32.025
and all the people will be at peace.

158
00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:36.025
And the advice seemed right in the eyes of Absalom

159
00:08:36.025 --> 00:08:37.345
and all the elders of Israel.

160
00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:41.075
Now let's just remember who these people are.

161
00:08:41.095 --> 00:08:44.155
Ah, Hitha fell. We saw this last week in chapter 16 was this

162
00:08:44.155 --> 00:08:48.475
well trusted, well-respected, um, advisor to the king.

163
00:08:49.415 --> 00:08:50.995
And everybody looked at him like he

164
00:08:51.165 --> 00:08:52.475
spoke the very words of God.

165
00:08:52.545 --> 00:08:54.755
Like that's how much he was respected.

166
00:08:56.205 --> 00:08:59.545
And so here, even in this moment, he gave good advice.

167
00:09:00.785 --> 00:09:03.315
Like it actually was humanly perfect.

168
00:09:04.135 --> 00:09:05.755
If you're trying to take out your

169
00:09:05.805 --> 00:09:07.235
enemy, this would've worked.

170
00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:12.405
Go strike him while he's weary, scatter his followers.

171
00:09:14.635 --> 00:09:17.165
Kill the king and bring everybody else back

172
00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:18.645
as you're the one who defeated him

173
00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:20.045
and they'll all follow you, right?

174
00:09:20.065 --> 00:09:23.445
That's the human way to go about this. That would've worked.

175
00:09:26.575 --> 00:09:28.915
But skip down to verse 14 with me real quick.

176
00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:33.115
Look at what verse 14 says

177
00:09:34.885 --> 00:09:36.995
about this whole scene

178
00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:41.945
and Absalom and all the men of Israel said The Council

179
00:09:41.965 --> 00:09:43.865
of Whoe, the Archie is better

180
00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:45.025
than the Council of Hitha fell.

181
00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:46.225
We'll come back to that in a second.

182
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:50.785
For the Lord had ordained to defeat the good counsel

183
00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.585
of a hitha fell so

184
00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:56.305
that the Lord might bring harm upon Absalom.

185
00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:02.695
So what we see here is

186
00:10:02.695 --> 00:10:05.015
that God is still fully in charge.

187
00:10:06.885 --> 00:10:08.425
He he's still fully in charge.

188
00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:10.105
It might have seemed like things are outta control.

189
00:10:11.535 --> 00:10:15.035
It might have seemed like things were about to overrun,

190
00:10:15.145 --> 00:10:16.155
enemy's about to win.

191
00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:18.235
But God had a plan the whole time.

192
00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:24.935
And God's plan was to bring judgment upon Absalom for all

193
00:10:24.935 --> 00:10:27.655
that Absalom had done to your ser his father

194
00:10:27.965 --> 00:10:29.335
with all the sin against the women

195
00:10:29.335 --> 00:10:31.135
that he committed in the previous chapters.

196
00:10:31.205 --> 00:10:34.135
Like all of that was God's judgment.

197
00:10:34.245 --> 00:10:36.855
He's bringing judgment on Absalom.

198
00:10:39.375 --> 00:10:40.755
And it's interesting how God did that.

199
00:10:42.415 --> 00:10:45.915
He actually used an inferior plan also presented

200
00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:47.715
to Absalom in the same scene.

201
00:10:48.695 --> 00:10:49.795
He saw it hinted at a little bit.

202
00:10:49.795 --> 00:10:52.475
There was this other advisor there named who Shy

203
00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:54.315
and he had a plan too.

204
00:10:55.015 --> 00:10:58.475
Now who was this guy? This guy was a, a man loyal to David.

205
00:10:59.535 --> 00:11:02.315
In fact functioned kinda like a spy here in this scene.

206
00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:04.355
But in the same moment

207
00:11:04.365 --> 00:11:06.275
after everybody looked at a Hitha fell

208
00:11:06.275 --> 00:11:07.675
and they were like, well that's great advice.

209
00:11:08.415 --> 00:11:11.735
For some reason Absalom says,

210
00:11:11.735 --> 00:11:13.975
well there's this other advisor who shy over here.

211
00:11:14.065 --> 00:11:16.175
Let's invite him in and see what he has to say.

212
00:11:17.795 --> 00:11:21.465
God's at work. And so what, who shy said in verses five

213
00:11:21.465 --> 00:11:23.145
through 13, he gives this plan

214
00:11:23.365 --> 00:11:26.945
that's actually really a bad plan comparatively

215
00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:28.105
to what Hitha fell said.

216
00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:31.825
Because what he said is basically,

217
00:11:31.915 --> 00:11:33.145
let's not try to kill David.

218
00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:35.705
David's this big warrior. We might get killed ourselves.

219
00:11:35.755 --> 00:11:39.425
Let's not do that. Let's instead amass this huge army

220
00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:42.265
and try to show strength against David

221
00:11:42.325 --> 00:11:43.785
and his few men over here.

222
00:11:44.045 --> 00:11:46.105
And maybe David will just like give up.

223
00:11:48.345 --> 00:11:49.675
Like it doesn't make any sense.

224
00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:53.885
But what it did in God's sovereign plan

225
00:11:54.465 --> 00:11:59.125
was it allowed David enough time to get away from the scene

226
00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:03.605
and go hide as they took the time to amass this great army.

227
00:12:06.175 --> 00:12:07.595
It gave David time to get away.

228
00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:09.955
'cause who shy after the scene, he goes

229
00:12:09.955 --> 00:12:11.555
and tells David through a course.

230
00:12:11.725 --> 00:12:14.755
We'll see in a second he gets David the information David

231
00:12:14.865 --> 00:12:17.195
runs off Hides has time to do that

232
00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.515
because it took a long time rather than

233
00:12:19.515 --> 00:12:20.915
what HiTA fellow's plan was,

234
00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:23.475
let's go tonight, let's go catch him.

235
00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:27.385
Now this plan takes time

236
00:12:28.045 --> 00:12:29.305
to gather all these people

237
00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:32.795
and we'll see how that worked out here in a moment.

238
00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:34.875
But here's the point. Let me just stop for a second.

239
00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:40.495
The point of all this so far is that God sovereignly,

240
00:12:40.935 --> 00:12:42.975
orchestrates defeat for the wicked.

241
00:12:44.505 --> 00:12:45.605
Now we're seeing that right here.

242
00:12:47.895 --> 00:12:50.605
Verse 14 was this insertion by the narrator to say,

243
00:12:50.605 --> 00:12:51.965
Hey listen, here's what's actually going

244
00:12:51.985 --> 00:12:53.085
on behind the scenes.

245
00:12:54.105 --> 00:12:58.205
God is ordaining all this stuff to bring harm upon Absalom.

246
00:12:58.205 --> 00:12:59.965
Why? Because Absalom was wicked

247
00:12:59.965 --> 00:13:02.245
and needed to be judged for what he had done.

248
00:13:02.465 --> 00:13:05.725
And so God is doing all of this, orchestrating all

249
00:13:05.725 --> 00:13:08.885
of these things to bring defeat for the wicked.

250
00:13:09.905 --> 00:13:12.005
And he did it through wild ways.

251
00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:13.925
This supposedly wise counselor,

252
00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:15.485
a Hitha fellow, everybody trusted him.

253
00:13:15.485 --> 00:13:16.965
Everybody believed what he said.

254
00:13:17.785 --> 00:13:20.245
God frustrated the plans that he gave

255
00:13:22.575 --> 00:13:24.675
In order to bring about God's purposes for David.

256
00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:29.125
Now, Absalon was fully responsible for choosing

257
00:13:29.305 --> 00:13:32.925
who shys advice over a hitha fellows that was on him.

258
00:13:33.185 --> 00:13:35.845
But again, God was ordaining the outcome

259
00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:37.725
to bring David back to the throne.

260
00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:43.885
Absalom didn't deserve to be there, deserved judgment.

261
00:13:44.785 --> 00:13:47.165
God was working that out to bring David back.

262
00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:51.045
And what does that teach us today?

263
00:13:53.185 --> 00:13:55.085
See, it's really easy for us to read these stories

264
00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:57.125
and think, man, that was a couple thousand years ago.

265
00:13:58.185 --> 00:13:59.605
I'm not facing anything like that.

266
00:13:59.765 --> 00:14:01.765
I don't have King I all this stuff, right?

267
00:14:03.025 --> 00:14:05.045
How does this relate to us today?

268
00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:06.645
Well, let's just think about this Christian.

269
00:14:08.755 --> 00:14:12.285
When the schemes of the enemy seem flawless,

270
00:14:15.465 --> 00:14:19.235
when wickedness seems unstoppable,

271
00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:24.695
what we learn is that God is still at

272
00:14:24.725 --> 00:14:25.725
Work.

273
00:14:26.935 --> 00:14:29.565
God's still working all of this behind the scenes.

274
00:14:29.825 --> 00:14:34.285
We cannot think that God is up there merely reacting

275
00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:39.505
to evil plans That he was somehow surprised like, oh man,

276
00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:40.625
I gotta figure out a better way.

277
00:14:40.625 --> 00:14:43.065
This is something that Fel said or I should figure out.

278
00:14:43.405 --> 00:14:46.865
God was already at work behind the scenes,

279
00:14:48.145 --> 00:14:50.065
frustrating, defeating the plans

280
00:14:50.405 --> 00:14:53.365
before they even began, right?

281
00:14:53.365 --> 00:14:55.325
You don't have to worry that he's like up there trying

282
00:14:55.325 --> 00:14:56.605
to figure it out and he's,

283
00:14:56.675 --> 00:14:58.685
he's not really sure how it's gonna play out.

284
00:14:59.555 --> 00:15:01.925
He's orchestrating defeat for those who are wicked

285
00:15:01.925 --> 00:15:03.085
for the wicked in this scene.

286
00:15:03.315 --> 00:15:06.325
He's saying, no, I am working all of this to bring about

287
00:15:06.325 --> 00:15:07.685
what I planned.

288
00:15:08.815 --> 00:15:10.485
Isn't that good news for us?

289
00:15:11.635 --> 00:15:13.845
When we look at the world and it seems like evil's winning,

290
00:15:13.905 --> 00:15:16.885
it seems like the plans are always against me or against us

291
00:15:17.105 --> 00:15:19.365
and we don't have to worry

292
00:15:20.405 --> 00:15:23.295
because God has it all in his hands.

293
00:15:23.395 --> 00:15:26.575
We can take heart in the same sovereignty

294
00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:29.455
that overcame Absalom's rebellion

295
00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:35.175
and we can praise the same God who turned the wisdom

296
00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.415
of this world into foolishness.

297
00:15:38.795 --> 00:15:43.665
He still does it today. God's sovereignly

298
00:15:44.145 --> 00:15:46.225
orchestrates defeat for the wicked.

299
00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:49.165
They will not win.

300
00:15:51.305 --> 00:15:55.265
Ultimately they will not win. So don't fear.

301
00:15:57.545 --> 00:16:00.045
And here's one way God did that in this scene.

302
00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:02.325
It's really interesting how he does

303
00:16:02.325 --> 00:16:03.925
that in one specific way,

304
00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:08.045
how he multiplies deliverance for David here.

305
00:16:09.785 --> 00:16:11.365
See, we've just seen, of course he,

306
00:16:11.795 --> 00:16:16.065
he's orchestrating defeat on one hand for the wicked,

307
00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:21.425
but at the same time he's multiplying deliverance

308
00:16:21.565 --> 00:16:25.685
for his people in multiple forms.

309
00:16:25.745 --> 00:16:27.285
For David here in chapter 17

310
00:16:27.285 --> 00:16:29.285
and 18, I wanna just walk you through really quickly

311
00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:31.725
some deliverance means

312
00:16:31.915 --> 00:16:33.525
that God brought about in David's life.

313
00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:35.805
Watch this. There's first this network

314
00:16:36.065 --> 00:16:38.125
of protection around David.

315
00:16:40.475 --> 00:16:42.645
I'll show you this. Verses 15 through 22.

316
00:16:44.415 --> 00:16:46.605
First you've got who shy even in the middle of this.

317
00:16:47.035 --> 00:16:49.565
Then verse 15, who shy said to

318
00:16:50.025 --> 00:16:53.005
and abiathar the priests, thus

319
00:16:53.005 --> 00:16:54.325
and so did the Hitha fellow council

320
00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:55.605
Absalom and the elders of Israel.

321
00:16:55.755 --> 00:16:59.445
Thus and so have I counseled now therefore send quickly

322
00:16:59.825 --> 00:17:02.005
and tell David, do not stay tonight

323
00:17:02.005 --> 00:17:03.205
at the forge of the wilderness.

324
00:17:03.465 --> 00:17:05.645
But by all means Passover lest the king

325
00:17:05.645 --> 00:17:07.205
and all the people are with him be swallowed up.

326
00:17:08.545 --> 00:17:11.725
Now Jonathan and Ahaz, by the way,

327
00:17:11.725 --> 00:17:12.845
these names are really hard for me

328
00:17:12.845 --> 00:17:14.325
to say too, so don't worry about it.

329
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:18.565
These are hard names they were waiting at in Rogel,

330
00:17:19.165 --> 00:17:21.965
a female servant was to go and tell them and they were to go

331
00:17:21.965 --> 00:17:23.565
and tell King David for they were not

332
00:17:23.565 --> 00:17:25.005
to be seen entering the city.

333
00:17:25.065 --> 00:17:26.085
Now just did you see that?

334
00:17:26.315 --> 00:17:29.485
Like there's like 12 people somehow involved here

335
00:17:29.485 --> 00:17:31.685
and you go tell him and her and she goes over here

336
00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:34.245
and tells them and it's, it's this whole network of people

337
00:17:36.885 --> 00:17:38.035
Watch eight verse 18.

338
00:17:38.095 --> 00:17:40.315
But a young man saw them and told Absalom.

339
00:17:41.335 --> 00:17:42.675
And so both of them went away quickly

340
00:17:42.735 --> 00:17:44.835
and came to the house of a man at Baim

341
00:17:45.015 --> 00:17:46.795
who had a well in his courtyard.

342
00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:49.765
And they went down into it and the woman took

343
00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:51.645
and spread a covering over the well's mouth

344
00:17:51.645 --> 00:17:54.605
and scattered grain on it and nothing was known of it.

345
00:17:56.115 --> 00:17:58.245
When Absalom servants came to the woman at the house,

346
00:17:58.245 --> 00:17:59.885
they said, where are Ahaz?

347
00:17:59.985 --> 00:18:02.645
And Jonathan and the woman said to them,

348
00:18:02.645 --> 00:18:05.805
they've gone over the brook of water and when they'd sought

349
00:18:05.805 --> 00:18:08.205
and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.

350
00:18:09.385 --> 00:18:11.935
After they'd gone, the men came up outta the well and went

351
00:18:11.935 --> 00:18:12.975
and told King David

352
00:18:13.595 --> 00:18:15.895
and they said to David, arise, go quickly over the water

353
00:18:15.915 --> 00:18:18.175
for thus and so has a helel counseled against you.

354
00:18:18.685 --> 00:18:20.535
Then David arose and all the people who were with him,

355
00:18:20.535 --> 00:18:23.295
they crossed the Jordan River by daybreak.

356
00:18:23.315 --> 00:18:25.455
Not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan,

357
00:18:25.525 --> 00:18:27.215
meaning they all got away.

358
00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:31.495
So again, did you see how many people were involved

359
00:18:31.495 --> 00:18:34.655
that God was ordaining, that these people talked to this guy

360
00:18:34.675 --> 00:18:36.295
and they met this man who had a well

361
00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:37.695
and they, they were scared

362
00:18:37.695 --> 00:18:39.135
because they were at risk of their lives

363
00:18:39.275 --> 00:18:40.455
and these people were coming after him.

364
00:18:40.455 --> 00:18:42.175
So they hid the well and this woman covered it up

365
00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:43.415
and nobody even knew it was there.

366
00:18:43.485 --> 00:18:46.375
Like all of this stuff. There's just this network of people

367
00:18:47.685 --> 00:18:48.935
that God has ordained.

368
00:18:49.755 --> 00:18:53.095
Why to protect David so

369
00:18:53.095 --> 00:18:55.055
that he would get the information he needed when he needed

370
00:18:55.055 --> 00:18:56.215
it so that he could get away.

371
00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:04.205
You get to the end of the chapter, the last three verses,

372
00:19:04.205 --> 00:19:05.525
talk about God providing food

373
00:19:05.525 --> 00:19:07.445
and supplies to David's men in the desert.

374
00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:10.605
Like they didn't have any ability to take food with them.

375
00:19:10.605 --> 00:19:14.395
They're on the run. God ordains these people

376
00:19:14.395 --> 00:19:15.955
to bring them food and water in the

377
00:19:15.955 --> 00:19:17.035
middle of the wilderness.

378
00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.195
You see God's deliverance showing up.

379
00:19:20.215 --> 00:19:22.795
It also shows up in the actual battle in chapter 18

380
00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:26.155
where Absalom did amass a great army.

381
00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.875
So he brings these thousands and thousands

382
00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:31.915
and thousands of people against David to try

383
00:19:31.915 --> 00:19:35.275
to defeat David, but watch how the fighting played out.

384
00:19:36.585 --> 00:19:38.235
This is it down into chapter 18.

385
00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:40.835
Now look at verses six through eight.

386
00:19:46.225 --> 00:19:48.885
So the army went out into the field against Israel

387
00:19:49.345 --> 00:19:52.045
and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim

388
00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:54.645
and the men of Israel were defeated there

389
00:19:54.665 --> 00:19:55.805
by the servants of David.

390
00:19:56.065 --> 00:19:58.205
And the loss there was great on that day.

391
00:19:58.205 --> 00:20:02.165
20,000 men, the battle spread over the face

392
00:20:02.225 --> 00:20:06.245
of all the country and the forest devoured more people

393
00:20:06.475 --> 00:20:08.165
that day than the sword.

394
00:20:10.705 --> 00:20:14.985
Did you catch that? Did you see what that just said?

395
00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:19.555
God himself became David's warrior

396
00:20:21.145 --> 00:20:24.715
utilizing even nature to swallow up

397
00:20:26.035 --> 00:20:28.195
soldiers even more than David's arm's.

398
00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:32.635
Swords did. The forest did it.

399
00:20:33.415 --> 00:20:37.195
God used even nature to deliver David.

400
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.755
Then there was Absalom himself.

401
00:20:41.935 --> 00:20:45.435
How did this work out dealing with this rebel

402
00:20:45.455 --> 00:20:46.875
who was trying to take the throne?

403
00:20:46.885 --> 00:20:51.325
Look at verse nine. And Absalom happened

404
00:20:51.325 --> 00:20:52.645
to meet the servants of David.

405
00:20:53.955 --> 00:20:55.445
Absalom was riding on his mule

406
00:20:55.445 --> 00:20:57.205
and the mule went under the thick branches

407
00:20:57.205 --> 00:21:00.685
of a great oak tree and his head caught fast in the oak

408
00:21:00.905 --> 00:21:02.445
and he was suspended between heaven

409
00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:06.725
and earth while the mule that was under him went on.

410
00:21:09.515 --> 00:21:10.575
Now isn't that ironic?

411
00:21:13.285 --> 00:21:17.125
Remember back in chapter 14 it described in great detail

412
00:21:17.435 --> 00:21:18.885
absalom's beautiful hair

413
00:21:21.475 --> 00:21:24.405
That he was the picture of every shampoo commercial

414
00:21:24.405 --> 00:21:25.485
you've ever seen on tv.

415
00:21:25.595 --> 00:21:30.285
This was the guy, five pounds worth of hair every year.

416
00:21:31.995 --> 00:21:35.215
It was the symbol of his pride and his vanity

417
00:21:35.435 --> 00:21:38.535
and it was something that here got him caught

418
00:21:40.495 --> 00:21:41.915
and put it a vulnerable position.

419
00:21:42.695 --> 00:21:46.835
The Very thing that marked him off as strength and

420
00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:49.755
and beauty and all this stuff was the very thing

421
00:21:49.945 --> 00:21:52.115
that caught him in the oak tree.

422
00:21:54.995 --> 00:21:56.735
Now we'll pick that back up in a second,

423
00:21:56.795 --> 00:22:00.415
but I don't want us to move past this too quickly, all

424
00:22:00.415 --> 00:22:01.695
that God just did for David.

425
00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.465
Like Watch, watch this. Do you see what he did?

426
00:22:05.725 --> 00:22:08.785
He used every circumstance to secure victory

427
00:22:09.085 --> 00:22:10.225
for his beloved.

428
00:22:13.195 --> 00:22:15.565
Just think about it. This, for some reason,

429
00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:17.205
acceptance of bad advice.

430
00:22:19.415 --> 00:22:21.195
Why would Absalon pick this one over that one?

431
00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:23.475
It was only God ordaining this, which

432
00:22:23.615 --> 00:22:25.755
by the way gave David time to get away

433
00:22:25.755 --> 00:22:29.515
because David was only one mile away from this

434
00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:30.555
whole scene happening.

435
00:22:32.315 --> 00:22:33.775
You think how quickly they would've found

436
00:22:33.775 --> 00:22:34.975
him and taken him out.

437
00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:36.215
He was just one mile away,

438
00:22:36.275 --> 00:22:37.975
but now they gotta amass this great army.

439
00:22:37.975 --> 00:22:39.175
They gotta go through the whole process.

440
00:22:39.265 --> 00:22:40.535
David has time to get away.

441
00:22:45.465 --> 00:22:47.555
You Think of the network of friendships

442
00:22:47.555 --> 00:22:50.795
that God had given David to hide him and his people.

443
00:22:53.515 --> 00:22:56.285
Even nature itself fought for David

444
00:22:57.535 --> 00:22:59.665
against this great army that was coming against them,

445
00:22:59.665 --> 00:23:00.905
against Absalom himself.

446
00:23:00.965 --> 00:23:04.945
You see, God was multiplying deliverance for David

447
00:23:05.975 --> 00:23:07.385
despite overwhelming odds.

448
00:23:07.485 --> 00:23:10.065
God was for his beloved son.

449
00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:11.145
He was looking at David

450
00:23:11.165 --> 00:23:14.065
and saying, I want you to be the one that reigns.

451
00:23:14.105 --> 00:23:16.585
I want you to be the line through which the Messiah comes.

452
00:23:16.705 --> 00:23:19.465
I need to protect you. And so God is delivering him

453
00:23:19.575 --> 00:23:22.105
through all of these other ways.

454
00:23:25.715 --> 00:23:27.425
Maybe you feel outnumbered right now.

455
00:23:30.595 --> 00:23:34.855
You feel like the enemy is just all over your life attacking

456
00:23:34.855 --> 00:23:36.135
you left and right,

457
00:23:36.635 --> 00:23:38.655
and the enemy is coming at you full strength

458
00:23:38.675 --> 00:23:40.095
and that's what you feel right now.

459
00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:42.215
Don't miss that. David's army was

460
00:23:42.475 --> 00:23:47.335
so much smaller than Absalom's, yet they prevailed.

461
00:23:50.005 --> 00:23:53.145
You remember, uh, back in judges the story of Gideon

462
00:23:54.715 --> 00:23:59.305
where God paired Gideon's army down to just 300 men,

463
00:24:01.845 --> 00:24:04.225
and yet God brought the victory

464
00:24:04.325 --> 00:24:06.305
for Gideon's army against the great hoard

465
00:24:06.305 --> 00:24:07.305
that was coming against them.

466
00:24:09.705 --> 00:24:13.335
It was God. It wasn't the army, it was God.

467
00:24:13.675 --> 00:24:15.295
It wasn't the army. It was nature.

468
00:24:15.435 --> 00:24:18.535
It was God using all these other means to deliver David.

469
00:24:18.595 --> 00:24:20.535
It wasn't the army, it wasn't the strength of the army.

470
00:24:20.755 --> 00:24:23.215
It wasn't the number of the army, it was God himself.

471
00:24:26.495 --> 00:24:29.075
Or maybe, maybe you feel inadequate.

472
00:24:31.645 --> 00:24:34.435
Maybe you feel that you don't measure up.

473
00:24:36.505 --> 00:24:37.955
There's no way God can use me.

474
00:24:37.955 --> 00:24:41.555
There's no way I really deserve anything.

475
00:24:41.635 --> 00:24:42.875
I, I just, I don't measure up.

476
00:24:44.855 --> 00:24:48.275
Do you remember God used a tree branch to do

477
00:24:48.275 --> 00:24:49.315
what the army couldn't do.

478
00:24:51.065 --> 00:24:52.755
Absalom riding through on his mule

479
00:24:52.755 --> 00:24:54.035
and he gets caught up there and,

480
00:24:54.055 --> 00:24:58.075
and God delivers his people from the one who is trying

481
00:24:58.075 --> 00:24:59.955
to take the throne by using a tree.

482
00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:03.025
Listen, if God can use a tree branch, he can use you.

483
00:25:08.775 --> 00:25:13.275
Here's the point. God does not need

484
00:25:13.755 --> 00:25:15.355
optimal conditions to save

485
00:25:15.355 --> 00:25:19.255
you God.

486
00:25:19.255 --> 00:25:20.255
He, he doesn't need,

487
00:25:23.155 --> 00:25:25.655
he creates salvation out of the very means.

488
00:25:25.995 --> 00:25:27.735
The enemy intends to destroy you.

489
00:25:29.315 --> 00:25:33.885
Like Romans 8 28 is not some wishful thinking.

490
00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:37.645
It's true. The settled purpose of God

491
00:25:37.865 --> 00:25:42.325
who works all things including timing, advice,

492
00:25:43.075 --> 00:25:47.445
friendships, nature, God works all things for the glory

493
00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:49.845
of God and the good of those who love him

494
00:25:49.865 --> 00:25:51.285
and are called according to his purpose.

495
00:25:52.115 --> 00:25:54.445
Like that's not, it's not just a pipe dream.

496
00:25:54.445 --> 00:25:56.845
It's not just something we hope happens. It's settled.

497
00:25:57.165 --> 00:26:01.605
I often think of this, you remember what Joseph said?

498
00:26:01.605 --> 00:26:02.925
This is Jacob's son back in Genesis.

499
00:26:03.525 --> 00:26:05.925
Remember what Joseph said to his brothers who had tried

500
00:26:05.925 --> 00:26:08.565
to kill him and then he ended up being like

501
00:26:08.595 --> 00:26:09.965
Pharaoh in all of Egypt.

502
00:26:11.105 --> 00:26:14.605
You remember what Joseph said? This is so powerful.

503
00:26:16.505 --> 00:26:18.925
He said to his brothers, as for you,

504
00:26:19.385 --> 00:26:21.125
you meant evil against me.

505
00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:25.685
But God meant it for good to bring it about

506
00:26:25.805 --> 00:26:29.205
that many people should be kept alive as they are today.

507
00:26:30.865 --> 00:26:34.365
The very thing that they intended to destroy him with.

508
00:26:34.625 --> 00:26:37.685
He said, no, no, no. God actually intended that so

509
00:26:37.685 --> 00:26:39.925
that I'm in my positions to keep you guys alive.

510
00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:43.005
It Was for his very deliverance.

511
00:26:43.225 --> 00:26:45.685
The thing that the enemy intends to destroy us

512
00:26:45.685 --> 00:26:49.285
with is the very thing that God saves us with.

513
00:26:49.655 --> 00:26:50.805
We'll get back to that later,

514
00:26:52.915 --> 00:26:54.535
but just again, God

515
00:26:55.135 --> 00:26:57.135
graciously multiplies deliverance for his people.

516
00:27:00.355 --> 00:27:02.215
He will for you if you're his child,

517
00:27:02.475 --> 00:27:06.465
it might not be on your time schedule, but he delivers you.

518
00:27:06.805 --> 00:27:08.545
He multiplies deliverance

519
00:27:08.845 --> 00:27:11.585
and he will ultimately deliver his children one day forever.

520
00:27:12.305 --> 00:27:14.145
Eternity is sure

521
00:27:15.855 --> 00:27:18.555
that's the one main way he delivers his children.

522
00:27:18.895 --> 00:27:22.875
But day by day, by day, he will work to deliver you

523
00:27:23.015 --> 00:27:25.955
and bring about his glory and your good day after day.

524
00:27:25.955 --> 00:27:27.555
It might not look like you think it should

525
00:27:27.695 --> 00:27:30.675
or what you would want, but it's for your good.

526
00:27:31.575 --> 00:27:34.235
As he delivers his children, just like he did

527
00:27:34.235 --> 00:27:36.835
for David, trust him.

528
00:27:39.055 --> 00:27:41.595
Now the story we left off

529
00:27:41.795 --> 00:27:43.915
with Absalom hanging from his hair in the

530
00:27:43.915 --> 00:27:46.555
tree and he's vulnerable.

531
00:27:47.525 --> 00:27:51.935
What's gonna happen? Well, tragically

532
00:27:51.935 --> 00:27:55.255
what happened next is that Joab, David's military leader,

533
00:27:55.905 --> 00:27:59.815
finds him and puts Javelins through his heart, kills him.

534
00:28:02.175 --> 00:28:03.475
Now the thing about that is

535
00:28:03.475 --> 00:28:06.795
that David had told his armies no one was to touch Absalom.

536
00:28:09.765 --> 00:28:12.745
Yet Joab taking matters into his own hands thinking he was

537
00:28:12.745 --> 00:28:15.065
somehow defending David's honor taking out

538
00:28:15.065 --> 00:28:16.145
this rebel to the throne.

539
00:28:16.495 --> 00:28:17.665
Joab went ahead and killed him.

540
00:28:17.665 --> 00:28:21.735
Anyway, that'll come back a few

541
00:28:21.735 --> 00:28:22.775
chapters later.

542
00:28:25.265 --> 00:28:26.645
But what they did

543
00:28:26.645 --> 00:28:31.285
with Absalom immediately was they buried him in the way

544
00:28:31.285 --> 00:28:35.425
that you were to bury someone who had been killed

545
00:28:35.725 --> 00:28:36.825
by hanging on a tree.

546
00:28:38.485 --> 00:28:40.775
Because they believed at the time that someone

547
00:28:40.775 --> 00:28:44.615
who was hanged on a tree like that was cursed.

548
00:28:46.445 --> 00:28:49.535
It's what it says in the law in Deuteronomy 21.

549
00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:53.655
It says, if a man has committed a crime punishable by death

550
00:28:53.675 --> 00:28:55.855
and he's put to death and you hang him on a tree,

551
00:28:56.475 --> 00:28:58.895
his body shall not remain all night on the tree,

552
00:28:59.155 --> 00:29:01.055
but you shall bury him the same day.

553
00:29:01.995 --> 00:29:04.095
For a hang man is cursed by God.

554
00:29:05.465 --> 00:29:06.645
You shall not defile your land.

555
00:29:06.645 --> 00:29:08.965
The Lord your God is giving you for an inheritance.

556
00:29:10.895 --> 00:29:13.675
So they had to, by virtue of their following the law,

557
00:29:13.675 --> 00:29:14.915
they had to take care of it immediately.

558
00:29:14.915 --> 00:29:16.315
Well, David wasn't close by,

559
00:29:16.575 --> 00:29:18.755
so David couldn't even see his son's body.

560
00:29:18.755 --> 00:29:20.035
They buried it immediately.

561
00:29:21.455 --> 00:29:23.995
And so watch what happens when David finds this out.

562
00:29:26.305 --> 00:29:27.645
He actually got two different stories.

563
00:29:27.705 --> 00:29:29.885
He had to discern which one was true, those kind of things.

564
00:29:29.905 --> 00:29:32.565
But look at the very end of two Samuel 18.

565
00:29:34.765 --> 00:29:38.735
It says verse 33, David finds out about

566
00:29:38.735 --> 00:29:39.775
what happened to Absalom.

567
00:29:39.775 --> 00:29:41.520
They buried his body. He didn't even see him.

568
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.725
All those things. Very end of 18. Look at verse 33.

569
00:29:47.915 --> 00:29:51.455
And the king was deeply moved, went up

570
00:29:51.455 --> 00:29:53.695
to the chamber over the gate and wept.

571
00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:57.775
And as he went, he said, oh my son, Absalom, my son,

572
00:29:57.835 --> 00:29:59.135
my son Absalom,

573
00:30:00.625 --> 00:30:03.015
would I had died instead of you.

574
00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:05.775
Oh, Absalom, my son, my son.

575
00:30:08.635 --> 00:30:13.265
It's tragic, right? The victory was complete.

576
00:30:14.245 --> 00:30:15.865
The rebellion had been squashed.

577
00:30:16.325 --> 00:30:18.185
The kingdom was secure again.

578
00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:21.985
Yet David was still full of grief.

579
00:30:25.545 --> 00:30:28.205
Why? Because the sins

580
00:30:28.205 --> 00:30:30.845
of his past again came full circle.

581
00:30:32.795 --> 00:30:35.735
His adultery, his murder, all of that,

582
00:30:35.795 --> 00:30:37.655
the family dysfunction shows up again.

583
00:30:37.655 --> 00:30:41.015
Nathan's prophecy was again fulfilled in this mess

584
00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:42.375
of of family.

585
00:30:45.715 --> 00:30:50.295
Yet at the same time, God's justice was accomplished.

586
00:30:53.855 --> 00:30:55.495
'cause when Absalom did what he did to David

587
00:30:55.555 --> 00:30:58.255
and to those concubines, he put himself under the judgment

588
00:30:58.275 --> 00:31:02.915
of God, under the justice of God, the curse of God.

589
00:31:04.215 --> 00:31:06.475
And he didn't have the covenant like David had, so

590
00:31:06.475 --> 00:31:07.675
that he was spared.

591
00:31:07.695 --> 00:31:11.875
He was safe. No, it was. It was why the tree was involved.

592
00:31:11.995 --> 00:31:14.405
I believe that because you're like,

593
00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:16.645
why in the world the tree thing, the hair, what?

594
00:31:16.675 --> 00:31:17.885
What is that? Even a part of this?

595
00:31:17.885 --> 00:31:21.205
Because again, Deuteronomy cursed is everyone

596
00:31:21.425 --> 00:31:24.615
who is hanged on a tree cursed.

597
00:31:26.275 --> 00:31:28.775
So what happened to him in the forest was symbolic

598
00:31:28.775 --> 00:31:30.335
of God's view of Absalom.

599
00:31:31.755 --> 00:31:33.055
He was cursed because of all that.

600
00:31:33.055 --> 00:31:35.415
He'd done all the sins he'd committed, he was cursed

601
00:31:36.515 --> 00:31:39.655
and God's judgment was on absalom's wickedness.

602
00:31:43.305 --> 00:31:47.085
Yet even knowing that David was grieved

603
00:31:47.755 --> 00:31:48.925
over the loss of his son,

604
00:31:52.285 --> 00:31:53.545
he cared for Absalom.

605
00:31:54.205 --> 00:31:56.025
He told everybody, don't touch Absalom.

606
00:31:56.185 --> 00:31:58.105
'cause maybe, maybe in the heart of his heart he,

607
00:31:58.445 --> 00:32:00.225
he really thought that Absalom

608
00:32:00.225 --> 00:32:01.385
and he could be reconciled someday,

609
00:32:01.955 --> 00:32:04.985
maybe the Absalom will repent, he'll turn, he'll be,

610
00:32:04.985 --> 00:32:07.105
he'll be right again and we can come back together.

611
00:32:07.195 --> 00:32:09.065
Maybe that's the case. Don't touch him.

612
00:32:12.975 --> 00:32:14.725
David was a loving father in spite

613
00:32:14.725 --> 00:32:16.525
of his rebellion against him as a father.

614
00:32:16.525 --> 00:32:20.405
David loved his son and one of the best for him.

615
00:32:24.005 --> 00:32:28.945
So what is God teaching us with this? Well, a couple things.

616
00:32:28.945 --> 00:32:33.585
First, it's the reminder that circumstances consequences

617
00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:36.625
are painful as a result of sin.

618
00:32:38.085 --> 00:32:39.605
Hasn't that been a constant theme

619
00:32:39.605 --> 00:32:40.845
throughout this whole book?

620
00:32:42.225 --> 00:32:44.725
Sin brings a mess in your life. Sin brings consequences.

621
00:32:44.865 --> 00:32:48.165
Sin brings pain. You reap what you sow right it.

622
00:32:48.185 --> 00:32:50.525
It should cause us to be a little bit apprehensive

623
00:32:50.525 --> 00:32:51.725
about walking into sin.

624
00:32:53.035 --> 00:32:54.285
Just the fact that we see the

625
00:32:54.285 --> 00:32:55.725
consequences of it in our daily lives.

626
00:32:55.725 --> 00:33:00.685
We're forgiven by grace and mercy, but let's avoid sin

627
00:33:00.995 --> 00:33:03.885
because of the pain, the consequence.

628
00:33:05.265 --> 00:33:07.725
So it's again, teaching us that it's reminding us of that.

629
00:33:08.225 --> 00:33:12.245
But there's another lesson here that we need to remember it.

630
00:33:12.245 --> 00:33:15.445
It's that the deliverance God brings in our lives

631
00:33:16.065 --> 00:33:19.125
may not wash away the grief over sins.

632
00:33:19.125 --> 00:33:22.935
Consequences. Like we're gonna face it, we're gonna feel it,

633
00:33:22.935 --> 00:33:25.695
it's gonna be painful, but just the fact

634
00:33:25.695 --> 00:33:27.495
that God delivers us from us doesn't

635
00:33:27.495 --> 00:33:29.335
mean that it won't hurt.

636
00:33:30.245 --> 00:33:32.125
Like Just because you come to Christ

637
00:33:32.145 --> 00:33:34.565
and are saved doesn't mean that life's gonna be just full

638
00:33:34.565 --> 00:33:36.365
of easygoing, fun things.

639
00:33:37.385 --> 00:33:41.005
It will still be painful. Life will still hurt.

640
00:33:41.295 --> 00:33:42.485
We're in the fallen world.

641
00:33:44.805 --> 00:33:46.145
The consequences of your past

642
00:33:46.205 --> 00:33:47.905
or other people's past will still hurt.

643
00:33:47.965 --> 00:33:50.185
And so it won't wash it away necessarily.

644
00:33:50.965 --> 00:33:52.505
It gives you peace in the middle of it, but,

645
00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:54.505
but it won't wash it away.

646
00:33:54.665 --> 00:33:57.105
That's why I believe this is pointing us

647
00:33:57.375 --> 00:33:58.825
forward to something else.

648
00:34:00.885 --> 00:34:04.815
Like we're always looking through the lenses of

649
00:34:05.155 --> 00:34:06.615
how does this point us to redemption?

650
00:34:08.095 --> 00:34:10.995
And so David's grief here over his son,

651
00:34:12.715 --> 00:34:14.355
I believe is pointing us forward

652
00:34:14.495 --> 00:34:16.715
to another father and another son.

653
00:34:19.815 --> 00:34:24.555
See when, when God, the Father in Matthew 13 says,

654
00:34:24.865 --> 00:34:29.235
this is my beloved son, he said

655
00:34:29.235 --> 00:34:33.395
that knowing that that son would die, I,

656
00:34:36.335 --> 00:34:40.155
but different than David not wanting Absalom to die.

657
00:34:40.825 --> 00:34:44.395
This Father God the Father, did allow his son

658
00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:45.835
to die for a purpose.

659
00:34:46.185 --> 00:34:47.755
It's what Romans 8 32 says.

660
00:34:47.855 --> 00:34:50.235
He who did not spare his own son,

661
00:34:50.535 --> 00:34:52.835
but gave him up for us all.

662
00:34:54.655 --> 00:34:57.075
See, here's the point. Looking through the lenses

663
00:34:57.175 --> 00:35:00.035
of redemption here, the whole Bible points us to this.

664
00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:04.995
It's that God mercifully secures eternity through the pain.

665
00:35:07.425 --> 00:35:11.725
God secures eternity through the pain. The cross.

666
00:35:12.075 --> 00:35:16.725
This is this, listen, the cross is God's ultimate reversal.

667
00:35:19.435 --> 00:35:24.035
'cause what looked like defeat in God's justice on sin

668
00:35:26.465 --> 00:35:30.205
became God's eternal victory in his

669
00:35:30.205 --> 00:35:31.565
mercy towards sinners.

670
00:35:33.285 --> 00:35:34.375
What looked like defeat.

671
00:35:34.395 --> 00:35:36.415
As everybody looked there, Jesus is dying on the cross.

672
00:35:36.525 --> 00:35:39.005
This is what's gonna happen. We're all falling apart.

673
00:35:39.465 --> 00:35:40.965
God, in that very moment

674
00:35:42.155 --> 00:35:46.245
when Jesus in his agony cried out, it is finished.

675
00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:48.005
It was that very death

676
00:35:48.275 --> 00:35:51.685
that secured our salvation 'cause.

677
00:35:51.685 --> 00:35:53.285
Listen to what Galatians three says about it.

678
00:35:55.185 --> 00:35:59.365
It says, Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law

679
00:35:59.905 --> 00:36:01.605
by becoming a curse for us.

680
00:36:02.025 --> 00:36:04.845
For it is written cursed is everyone

681
00:36:05.025 --> 00:36:06.845
who is hanged on a tree.

682
00:36:11.345 --> 00:36:15.965
So that curse that Absalom was under that led him

683
00:36:15.985 --> 00:36:17.205
to be hanged on a tree.

684
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:19.205
The curse that every one of us is under.

685
00:36:19.615 --> 00:36:22.405
Jesus took that curse for us.

686
00:36:24.665 --> 00:36:26.965
He hanged on the tree for us.

687
00:36:27.345 --> 00:36:31.045
It might not rid you of sins consequences in the day to day,

688
00:36:31.305 --> 00:36:32.805
but you can always remember

689
00:36:32.915 --> 00:36:35.205
that your ultimate victory has already been won.

690
00:36:37.105 --> 00:36:40.565
The greater David has defeated the greater enemy, that

691
00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:44.805
that reality, that death itself is swallowed up in victory

692
00:36:44.875 --> 00:36:46.485
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

693
00:36:48.025 --> 00:36:49.325
That's why you can trust

694
00:36:49.325 --> 00:36:53.125
that when there seems like no way out, God makes a way

695
00:36:54.275 --> 00:36:56.165
when it seems like the enemy's coming at you

696
00:36:56.345 --> 00:37:00.405
or even nature itself is against you, God himself turns all

697
00:37:00.405 --> 00:37:02.365
of that for his glory and for your good.

698
00:37:04.465 --> 00:37:05.805
That's why we can trust him.

699
00:37:06.705 --> 00:37:10.165
He orchestrated every detail for David to be delivered.

700
00:37:10.345 --> 00:37:12.325
He does the same for you and for me.

701
00:37:12.385 --> 00:37:13.445
If we trust him

702
00:37:14.595 --> 00:37:17.405
with everything we are, he works it out.

703
00:37:17.715 --> 00:37:19.005
He's good. So trust him.

704
00:37:20.715 --> 00:37:23.085
Lord, we pray that you help us trust you more today.

705
00:37:24.155 --> 00:37:27.565
That Lord, there is, there is nothing we bring to the table.

706
00:37:27.635 --> 00:37:28.685
This is your victory.

707
00:37:28.825 --> 00:37:31.405
And I pray for those in this room that are struggling

708
00:37:31.405 --> 00:37:36.245
with being overwhelmed, feeling, uh, insecure, un inadequate

709
00:37:36.345 --> 00:37:38.845
or don't measure up or whatever it is.

710
00:37:40.865 --> 00:37:44.725
Or maybe even feeling like, man, yesterday what I did is,

711
00:37:44.905 --> 00:37:46.165
is gonna ruin it forever.

712
00:37:46.445 --> 00:37:49.085
I I've lost my salvation or, or whatever.

713
00:37:49.145 --> 00:37:51.165
God, may we all remember today

714
00:37:53.675 --> 00:37:55.885
that it is your work not ours.

715
00:37:56.905 --> 00:37:58.925
It is your victory, not ours.

716
00:38:00.345 --> 00:38:02.645
It is you who accomplished all that was needed

717
00:38:02.645 --> 00:38:07.125
to be the perfect sacrifice that takes our place on

718
00:38:07.125 --> 00:38:11.355
that tree, that takes the curse that we are under on

719
00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:14.235
that tree that defeats death.

720
00:38:14.305 --> 00:38:17.595
It's swallowed up in victory in Jesus Christ, our Lord.

721
00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:20.195
May we all walk in confidence

722
00:38:20.195 --> 00:38:23.675
and assurance that that's true today, just like it was

723
00:38:23.675 --> 00:38:28.505
for David Living life

724
00:38:28.615 --> 00:38:31.425
that honors you in response day by day

725
00:38:31.555 --> 00:38:33.425
where it looks impossible.

726
00:38:33.425 --> 00:38:35.685
People see our lives and think, how can you have peace

727
00:38:35.985 --> 00:38:38.205
and you can walk in assurance and confidence

728
00:38:39.915 --> 00:38:42.645
because of the victory God delivers us

729
00:38:44.865 --> 00:38:46.845
and we can look with assurance at death and a

730
00:38:46.905 --> 00:38:48.765
and an eternity with confidence

731
00:38:48.765 --> 00:38:50.085
because Jesus defeated death.

732
00:38:52.075 --> 00:38:53.805
What a privilege God it is to be able

733
00:38:53.805 --> 00:38:54.885
to know that those things are true.

734
00:38:54.955 --> 00:38:56.965
Help us Holy Spirit to live that out today.

735
00:38:57.255 --> 00:39:00.245
Maybe somebody in this room has never trusted you with that

736
00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:03.325
and they've tried and they're exhausted, but they want you.

737
00:39:03.585 --> 00:39:05.325
God, I pray that they would just in their hearts

738
00:39:05.345 --> 00:39:06.365
say, Jesus, I'm a sinner.

739
00:39:06.445 --> 00:39:09.005
I need you. I need you to take that place. You did.

740
00:39:09.245 --> 00:39:13.605
I believe it. Come we live it. I'm all you. I'm all yours.

741
00:39:18.275 --> 00:39:20.325
Lord, I pray that you would remind us that we're not alone.

742
00:39:21.275 --> 00:39:22.965
None of us are alone. If we're your child

743
00:39:23.025 --> 00:39:26.525
by faith in Christ, we're not alone any moment of any day.

744
00:39:28.185 --> 00:39:29.285
We won't be alone forever.

745
00:39:29.665 --> 00:39:32.445
We praise you for that soon coming return.

746
00:39:32.585 --> 00:39:34.485
But today we're not alone.

747
00:39:37.315 --> 00:39:40.045
Give us courage in that. In Jesus' name, amen.

748
00:39:40.215 --> 00:39:42.205
Let's stand together and worship. In response.

749
00:39:43.545 --> 00:39:43.765
We.
