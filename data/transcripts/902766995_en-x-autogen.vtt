WEBVTT

1
00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:51.425
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:54.465
Aren't you glad our new heaters are working so well today?

3
00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:59.145
Amen. Right. What a ride The last few days have been

4
00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:01.865
earthquakes and bitter cold

5
00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:04.305
and, uh, finding out I have a torn meniscus.

6
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:05.625
So it's been a great week.

7
00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:10.185
Uh, gonna get it, uh, cleaned up a week from tomorrow,

8
00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:11.745
so thank you for praying for that.

9
00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:14.105
Also, you may have noticed, uh, it's hard not

10
00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:17.665
to if you were in the lobby, the big number 60 out there,

11
00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:20.265
uh, it is like 10 feet tall,

12
00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:23.305
but uh, maybe some new logos around as well.

13
00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:25.505
Why do we have those going on?

14
00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:29.225
Well, because this year is our 60th anniversary as a church,

15
00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:30.985
uh, we are celebrating

16
00:01:30.985 --> 00:01:33.105
that over the next few months we're gonna highlight

17
00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:34.985
what God has done over the years

18
00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:36.905
as we're standing here on the shoulders

19
00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:38.665
or sitting here on the shoulders of

20
00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:40.505
so many who've gone before us.

21
00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:43.145
And we're just gonna highlight that, uh, culminating in a,

22
00:01:43.185 --> 00:01:45.505
a big celebration in late April.

23
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.425
As we honor what God's done today though,

24
00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:50.425
we're gonna continue in our new first things

25
00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:51.585
first sermon series.

26
00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:53.865
We're studying the essential doctrines

27
00:01:53.925 --> 00:01:55.025
of the Christian faith.

28
00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:57.145
What makes us distinctly Christian?

29
00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:00.265
Uh, as I shared last week, you saw it in the video again,

30
00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:04.945
we, we can't focus on second and third tier matters.

31
00:02:05.395 --> 00:02:09.145
First. We can't put the pebbles in the sand in the jar first

32
00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:12.265
because then the big rocks won't fit.

33
00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:16.025
We can't get them appropriately as they need to be in there.

34
00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:18.345
And so we gotta put the primary things in first,

35
00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:23.145
the first things in first, and then those less important

36
00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:25.545
or or unclear doctrines can fit

37
00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.345
around those in a healthy way.

38
00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:29.665
And tho there's gonna be seven of these.

39
00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:31.825
There's probably more you could find, but,

40
00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:33.225
but there's seven we're gonna look at

41
00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:35.465
that are big rocks essentials

42
00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:36.985
to our faith over the next few weeks.

43
00:02:37.605 --> 00:02:39.185
So our first big rock last Sunday,

44
00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:41.905
it's already in the jar now you can see it was the doctrine

45
00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:45.545
of revelation that God has revealed himself

46
00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:49.185
to us in nature through his word

47
00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:52.305
and even by coming in Jesus Christ.

48
00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:56.745
And so our second big rock as we get to today is

49
00:02:57.055 --> 00:03:00.045
what God has told us about himself.

50
00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:02.525
And so we'll put the second rock in here.

51
00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:05.965
It is the attributes of God.

52
00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:10.925
What has God told us about himself? What God is, who God is.

53
00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:13.325
That's what we're looking at today, the things

54
00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:16.565
that are true about his nature, his essence, plus

55
00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:18.405
what is true about his person.

56
00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:20.565
We're gonna see a lot of those today.

57
00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:23.605
Now, it is only going to be a glimpse of that today.

58
00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:27.005
This is a massive doctrine just to,

59
00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:28.365
we'll see how big God is.

60
00:03:28.365 --> 00:03:30.765
So think about how big this belief is.

61
00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:32.405
And so we're just gonna look at a glimpse of it.

62
00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:35.005
We're gonna start in Acts 17 today.

63
00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:36.965
So grab your copy of God's Word.

64
00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:39.925
Turn with me to Acts chapter 17.

65
00:03:40.035 --> 00:03:44.445
It's in the New Testament that will be in Acts 17 for that.

66
00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:47.385
Now, I said it last week

67
00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:51.585
that many religions teak teach things about their gods,

68
00:03:52.655 --> 00:03:56.105
many of which may be similar to things we say about God.

69
00:03:56.805 --> 00:03:59.065
And so it's important for us to distinguish

70
00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:01.745
what we mean when we say God.

71
00:04:03.915 --> 00:04:06.815
For example, many people would believe

72
00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:09.695
that we worship the same God that Muslims worship.

73
00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:14.365
We don't. It's not true.

74
00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:19.205
You're gonna see things today that are only true of the God,

75
00:04:19.385 --> 00:04:20.805
of the universe.

76
00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:24.805
Very different than other gods out there.

77
00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:28.595
But the difficulty of doing this, of really

78
00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:32.115
any theological study, it's what's been said

79
00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:36.515
before, that all of our attempts to define God

80
00:04:37.065 --> 00:04:39.755
only serve to diminish God

81
00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:43.765
because he's so much higher than,

82
00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:46.045
than even our words can explain

83
00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:48.925
and understand in our, our little brains.

84
00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:51.925
Like he's so, so we have to try, right?

85
00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:54.845
We, we can't not have beliefs, right?

86
00:04:55.705 --> 00:04:57.845
But we just have to realize these things are going

87
00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:02.005
to diminish in a way what God really is,

88
00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:03.285
who God really is.

89
00:05:04.975 --> 00:05:08.435
So we have to have beliefs about proper beliefs about God

90
00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:11.395
because if we don't have proper beliefs about God, then,

91
00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:13.275
then all of us are theologians.

92
00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:15.355
All of us are thinking about God in some way.

93
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:16.715
So either we have right beliefs

94
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:21.315
or we're making up our own stuff about who God is, who we,

95
00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:22.795
who we want him to be maybe.

96
00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:26.595
And that becomes who we conceive God to be.

97
00:05:26.655 --> 00:05:29.075
But that is just what you'll see in Acts 17

98
00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:30.395
and imagining something.

99
00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:34.875
And that's called idolatry. It's not where we want to be.

100
00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:38.355
And so to get proper beliefs about God, we study his word,

101
00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:41.675
his special revelation, what he's told us about himself,

102
00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.595
that's where we find out about him.

103
00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:45.275
But here's another caution.

104
00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:50.035
We cannot just study the Bible to be informed about God.

105
00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:54.235
We must study the Bible to be transformed by God.

106
00:05:56.355 --> 00:06:00.895
Calvin said it to know God is to be changed by God.

107
00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.045
That's the whole point of this.

108
00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:08.285
What true theology does is it brings our minds to a place

109
00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:11.445
where we understand more about who this God really is.

110
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.685
It should only lead us to worship him more.

111
00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:18.075
That's what this whole series is about.

112
00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:21.315
And so as we turn to Acts 17, lemme set the context

113
00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:22.555
for you as we get there.

114
00:06:22.575 --> 00:06:24.315
The Apostle Paul was on one

115
00:06:24.315 --> 00:06:26.835
of his missionary journeys throughout the Mediterranean.

116
00:06:26.835 --> 00:06:28.795
Here he was in Athens, Greece.

117
00:06:28.895 --> 00:06:30.635
You can still go to some of these same places.

118
00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:34.315
Even today, Athens was full of people trying to figure out

119
00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:35.875
who and what God is.

120
00:06:36.765 --> 00:06:38.355
There were spiritual, religious,

121
00:06:38.575 --> 00:06:41.835
but they didn't know the truth of God's special revelation

122
00:06:42.415 --> 00:06:44.195
to point them to salvation.

123
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.535
They had a sense of God,

124
00:06:46.535 --> 00:06:48.615
they could see God in some sense in nature,

125
00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:50.255
but they, they didn't know who he was.

126
00:06:50.255 --> 00:06:53.605
And so they were trying to figure it out. Enter Paul.

127
00:06:55.285 --> 00:06:56.665
He saw idols everywhere.

128
00:06:57.565 --> 00:07:01.145
So he began preaching about Jesus and the resurrection

129
00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:03.105
and boldly doing that.

130
00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:07.155
And so naturally these, these inquisitive people,

131
00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:09.275
religious people would ask for more information.

132
00:07:09.975 --> 00:07:11.995
So here's how Paul responded.

133
00:07:13.305 --> 00:07:16.085
He preached one of the most powerful evangelistic

134
00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:17.445
sermons you will ever hear.

135
00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:21.825
And it's here in Acts 17, starting in verse 22.

136
00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:25.505
Just gonna see the sermon that he preached here.

137
00:07:27.775 --> 00:07:30.905
Acts 17, starting in 22 down through 31.

138
00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:35.205
So Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, this is

139
00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:38.085
where they would debate ideas and things like that.

140
00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:42.325
He said, this men of Athens, I perceive

141
00:07:42.325 --> 00:07:44.445
that in every way you are very religious.

142
00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:46.905
For as I passed along

143
00:07:46.905 --> 00:07:48.705
and observed the objects of your worship,

144
00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.705
I found also an altar with this inscription

145
00:07:52.525 --> 00:07:54.505
to the unknown God.

146
00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:57.955
Like they were just trying to cover their bases,

147
00:07:57.955 --> 00:07:59.875
basically Make sure we get at all of 'em, right?

148
00:08:01.345 --> 00:08:03.795
What therefore you worship as unknown.

149
00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:08.235
This I proclaim to you that God who made the world

150
00:08:08.335 --> 00:08:10.635
and everything in it being Lord of heaven

151
00:08:10.655 --> 00:08:14.195
and earth does not live in temples made by man,

152
00:08:15.055 --> 00:08:17.115
nor is he served by human hands

153
00:08:17.175 --> 00:08:18.395
as though he needed anything.

154
00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:21.615
Since he himself gives to all mankind life

155
00:08:21.675 --> 00:08:22.895
and breath and everything.

156
00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:26.535
And he made from one man every nation of mankind

157
00:08:26.555 --> 00:08:28.255
to live on all the face of the earth,

158
00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:30.535
having determined allotted periods

159
00:08:30.555 --> 00:08:32.695
and the boundaries of their dwelling place

160
00:08:33.815 --> 00:08:35.665
that they should seek God

161
00:08:36.285 --> 00:08:38.545
and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him.

162
00:08:39.705 --> 00:08:42.045
Yet he's actually not far from each one of us.

163
00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:45.875
For in Him we live and move and have our being.

164
00:08:46.135 --> 00:08:48.955
As some of even your own poets have said,

165
00:08:49.455 --> 00:08:50.995
for we are indeed his offspring.

166
00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:54.535
Well being then God's offspring, we ought not to think

167
00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:57.365
that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone.

168
00:08:57.865 --> 00:09:01.845
An image formed by the art and imagination of man.

169
00:09:03.495 --> 00:09:05.115
The times of ignorance got overlooked.

170
00:09:05.815 --> 00:09:08.595
But now he commands all people everywhere to repent

171
00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:12.315
because he's fixed a day on which he will judge the world in

172
00:09:12.315 --> 00:09:16.305
righteousness by a man whom he has appointed in all of this.

173
00:09:16.335 --> 00:09:20.225
He's given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.

174
00:09:21.725 --> 00:09:24.585
God, thank you for this powerful passage

175
00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:28.085
where Paul gets to describe

176
00:09:28.745 --> 00:09:30.605
in limited form even who you are.

177
00:09:32.535 --> 00:09:35.635
So show us today who we need to see you to be

178
00:09:36.695 --> 00:09:37.995
the truth of who you are.

179
00:09:39.965 --> 00:09:41.255
Open our eyes to see it.

180
00:09:41.285 --> 00:09:43.295
Open our hearts to understand it

181
00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:46.215
and our minds to understand it a little bit more.

182
00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:50.315
So that we would live as you want us

183
00:09:50.315 --> 00:09:52.925
to live a little bit more every day.

184
00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:57.455
Thank you God. Give us eyes today in Jesus' name. Amen.

185
00:09:59.855 --> 00:10:02.395
Now when we talk about the attributes of God,

186
00:10:02.615 --> 00:10:06.075
we don't mean like component parts of God,

187
00:10:07.785 --> 00:10:10.675
like water is components of hydrogen

188
00:10:10.695 --> 00:10:12.835
and oxygen mixed together and this makes water.

189
00:10:12.935 --> 00:10:15.155
No, no. When we talk about the attributes of God,

190
00:10:15.645 --> 00:10:17.875
we're talking about how each one of these

191
00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:20.395
describes his total being.

192
00:10:21.735 --> 00:10:26.075
So he is all of these things in all ways yet

193
00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:30.195
because we again are limited, we've said a lot today

194
00:10:30.195 --> 00:10:32.315
because we're limited by our humanity.

195
00:10:32.415 --> 00:10:35.035
We have to talk about his attributes separately.

196
00:10:37.025 --> 00:10:39.605
And so scholars have often broken down God's attributes

197
00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:40.685
into two categories.

198
00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:43.275
I'm gonna follow uh,

199
00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:45.835
Gerald bra pretty closely today in how he structured this.

200
00:10:45.885 --> 00:10:49.555
First there are God's essential attributes.

201
00:10:51.225 --> 00:10:55.485
So two categories. First, his essential attributes.

202
00:10:55.485 --> 00:10:58.925
These are the things that are essential to his being.

203
00:11:00.085 --> 00:11:04.805
They're at the core of how God works, right?

204
00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:08.965
Essential. These are also the things of God that we would

205
00:11:09.475 --> 00:11:11.445
call incommunicable.

206
00:11:12.345 --> 00:11:13.715
It's a really fun word to say, by the way.

207
00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.395
It just sounds like you're babbling incommunicable, right?

208
00:11:17.495 --> 00:11:20.035
Spills out of your mouth, right? Incommunicable.

209
00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:21.755
So anyway, you can surprise your

210
00:11:21.755 --> 00:11:22.835
friends later with that one.

211
00:11:22.855 --> 00:11:24.875
But meaning that that word means

212
00:11:25.145 --> 00:11:28.115
that they don't translate from him to us.

213
00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:30.595
They're not shared.

214
00:11:30.745 --> 00:11:34.035
They are only true of the God of the universe.

215
00:11:34.035 --> 00:11:35.395
They're not true of us in any way.

216
00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:38.045
They're only true of him fully.

217
00:11:40.035 --> 00:11:44.815
So there's essential who he is in that kind of what he is.

218
00:11:45.115 --> 00:11:48.975
But there are also what we call God's relational attributes.

219
00:11:49.955 --> 00:11:52.215
So we have essential and relational.

220
00:11:52.225 --> 00:11:55.245
These are the things that describe how he relates to us

221
00:11:57.135 --> 00:12:00.395
and and these are really things that we can share as well.

222
00:12:01.055 --> 00:12:03.755
That's why we mean these are communicable.

223
00:12:04.345 --> 00:12:07.395
They were incommunicable before and essential, but,

224
00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:12.115
but these relational ones are able to be shared.

225
00:12:12.295 --> 00:12:15.035
But we have to remember this though as we say that

226
00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:19.315
God is these things in an absolute sense.

227
00:12:19.415 --> 00:12:23.955
He is perfectly all of these relational attributes, even

228
00:12:23.955 --> 00:12:26.915
where we, even though we can express them in some way,

229
00:12:26.975 --> 00:12:29.575
are still going to be limited in the way

230
00:12:29.895 --> 00:12:30.975
we can express them.

231
00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:33.725
God is perfect in everything He is.

232
00:12:34.305 --> 00:12:37.765
We will show some of these but not perfectly.

233
00:12:39.305 --> 00:12:40.765
So I know this is difficult already.

234
00:12:40.775 --> 00:12:43.245
We're getting into it pretty quickly. So let's use act 17.

235
00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:46.965
Use this as a way to kind of see these essential

236
00:12:46.965 --> 00:12:49.605
and relational attributes in a limited form.

237
00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:50.925
So first we're gonna look at some

238
00:12:50.925 --> 00:12:52.845
of God's essential attributes.

239
00:12:52.845 --> 00:12:55.245
What are some examples we can find even here?

240
00:12:56.755 --> 00:12:58.055
Now, the three we're gonna look at today,

241
00:12:58.055 --> 00:12:59.895
we call these the Omnis.

242
00:13:01.705 --> 00:13:03.365
Not just a chain of nice hotels.

243
00:13:03.705 --> 00:13:05.725
But all you see here is

244
00:13:06.075 --> 00:13:09.085
what God is like.

245
00:13:09.085 --> 00:13:10.125
This is his nature.

246
00:13:12.265 --> 00:13:14.855
Again, we're not saying these are the only three,

247
00:13:15.315 --> 00:13:18.975
not comprehensive, but even just these three will see,

248
00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:23.455
will emphasize how different God is than us.

249
00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:25.495
His otherness. You might say,

250
00:13:27.565 --> 00:13:30.755
here's the first one, omnipotence.

251
00:13:31.965 --> 00:13:33.505
Put it on the screen so you can see it.

252
00:13:33.505 --> 00:13:35.105
Write it down omnipotence.

253
00:13:37.545 --> 00:13:41.205
Now what does that prefix omni actually mean? It means all.

254
00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:45.205
And so you see the word all

255
00:13:45.945 --> 00:13:48.565
and then do you see the word potent there?

256
00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:52.885
Potent. Potent. It means powerful.

257
00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:56.165
Like that plugin, air fresh, nurture your house.

258
00:13:56.265 --> 00:14:00.405
It is potent, right? There's, there's a power there, right?

259
00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:02.645
So when we say omnipotence, what we mean is

260
00:14:02.645 --> 00:14:04.405
that God is all powerful.

261
00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:08.005
It means he can do anything and everything.

262
00:14:08.005 --> 00:14:10.565
You see that here in Paul's description of God,

263
00:14:10.585 --> 00:14:11.805
in in verses 24

264
00:14:11.805 --> 00:14:16.355
and 25, the God who made the world

265
00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:18.355
and everything in it being Lord of heaven

266
00:14:18.375 --> 00:14:20.995
and earth does not live in temples made by man.

267
00:14:21.135 --> 00:14:22.995
Nor is he served by human hands

268
00:14:23.135 --> 00:14:24.555
as though he needed anything.

269
00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:29.515
Since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath

270
00:14:30.015 --> 00:14:32.295
and everything, right?

271
00:14:32.295 --> 00:14:34.095
So you see it here, God is described

272
00:14:34.115 --> 00:14:36.335
as the creator of everything.

273
00:14:36.365 --> 00:14:38.415
He's the Lord of heaven and earth.

274
00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:42.455
That means he created it all and he's sovereign over it all.

275
00:14:42.645 --> 00:14:45.135
That by definition means he's all powerful.

276
00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:50.595
To give life, you have to have life in yourself.

277
00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:52.565
All powerful.

278
00:14:54.575 --> 00:14:57.875
But it also means that God does not need to be fed or

279
00:14:58.235 --> 00:15:01.515
provided for like their gods did in Athens.

280
00:15:04.635 --> 00:15:08.455
In fact, there's nothing we can ever provide for God

281
00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:12.125
because he never hungers.

282
00:15:12.905 --> 00:15:17.385
He never thirsts. He never sleeps.

283
00:15:19.515 --> 00:15:22.775
He he never suffers and need to be cared for.

284
00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:27.055
He never needs anything. He's all powerful.

285
00:15:28.175 --> 00:15:31.625
He's self-sustaining, doesn't need any outside force.

286
00:15:31.815 --> 00:15:33.105
He's never changing.

287
00:15:33.445 --> 00:15:35.945
He is the same yesterday, today and forever.

288
00:15:36.175 --> 00:15:39.705
He's without beginning. He's uncreated, he's eternal.

289
00:15:40.175 --> 00:15:42.385
He's immortal, he's infinite.

290
00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:46.295
He actually gives us all that we need.

291
00:15:46.565 --> 00:15:49.215
That all means he's all powerful.

292
00:15:50.545 --> 00:15:51.195
He's omni

293
00:15:53.255 --> 00:15:56.535
potent, all powerful.

294
00:15:58.405 --> 00:15:59.425
Here's the second one.

295
00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:02.935
We could talk a lot more about that one of course,

296
00:16:03.035 --> 00:16:04.495
but there's a second here.

297
00:16:05.775 --> 00:16:10.085
Omnipresence, omni

298
00:16:10.615 --> 00:16:14.325
again all and then the word presence, location.

299
00:16:16.605 --> 00:16:19.095
This word means he is all present.

300
00:16:21.635 --> 00:16:25.775
God is present every point of space with his whole being.

301
00:16:27.285 --> 00:16:31.585
He is everywhere you see it here, look again verses 26

302
00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:35.935
through 28, he made from one man every nation of mankind

303
00:16:35.935 --> 00:16:37.255
to live on all the face of the earth.

304
00:16:37.255 --> 00:16:39.655
There's a little more of the creative power having

305
00:16:40.055 --> 00:16:41.295
determined allotted periods.

306
00:16:41.295 --> 00:16:42.975
That means the time in which they live

307
00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:45.695
and boundaries in their dwelling place means he's

308
00:16:45.695 --> 00:16:46.935
sovereign over where we live.

309
00:16:46.935 --> 00:16:49.495
And when that they should seek God,

310
00:16:49.495 --> 00:16:52.255
perhaps feel their way toward him and find him.

311
00:16:52.355 --> 00:16:55.415
Yet he's actually not that far from us.

312
00:16:57.225 --> 00:17:01.485
So you see this idea that he, the God of the universe

313
00:17:03.065 --> 00:17:05.725
is fully present in every place.

314
00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:09.685
He's scattered humanity all over the world

315
00:17:09.905 --> 00:17:12.885
and yet he is near to everyone.

316
00:17:14.955 --> 00:17:18.175
So he has to be omnipresent in order to be near

317
00:17:18.235 --> 00:17:19.495
to everyone all over the world.

318
00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:22.785
He's fully present in every place.

319
00:17:23.165 --> 00:17:25.665
Now, those pagan gods, the ones in Athens,

320
00:17:25.665 --> 00:17:27.425
they were local deities

321
00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:30.605
and they were, they were just like for their little region

322
00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:32.165
or for their group of people.

323
00:17:33.145 --> 00:17:35.165
But God is different.

324
00:17:36.865 --> 00:17:40.925
In fact, I love how Psalm 1 39 describes it so well.

325
00:17:43.215 --> 00:17:46.085
David says, where shall I go from your spirit?

326
00:17:46.385 --> 00:17:50.335
God, where shall I flee from your presence?

327
00:17:51.035 --> 00:17:53.055
If I ascend to heaven, you are there.

328
00:17:53.395 --> 00:17:55.935
If I make my bed in Shol the place

329
00:17:55.935 --> 00:17:57.175
of the dead, you are there.

330
00:17:59.225 --> 00:18:00.685
If I take the wings of the morning

331
00:18:00.745 --> 00:18:03.005
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,

332
00:18:03.555 --> 00:18:06.045
even there your hand shall lead me

333
00:18:06.345 --> 00:18:09.165
and your right hand shall hold me.

334
00:18:11.365 --> 00:18:15.975
How is it possible though for God to be everywhere?

335
00:18:18.395 --> 00:18:21.485
Because in his essence, right, this is, this is the things

336
00:18:21.485 --> 00:18:23.245
that are not communicable to us.

337
00:18:23.465 --> 00:18:26.685
In his essence, God is spirit. He's invisible.

338
00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:31.495
He's infinite. So he can be everywhere.

339
00:18:33.635 --> 00:18:35.175
Now. Now let's think about that for a second

340
00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:37.695
because if God is everywhere,

341
00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.295
that means he is everywhere, right?

342
00:18:41.395 --> 00:18:43.815
And that can be bad news to us

343
00:18:45.245 --> 00:18:49.505
because that means there's nothing we can hide from God.

344
00:18:53.395 --> 00:18:55.735
But listen, it should also be good news for us

345
00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:00.425
because you saw what David said in Psalm 1 39,

346
00:19:01.835 --> 00:19:04.745
wherever we go, God is there with us.

347
00:19:06.315 --> 00:19:07.925
Like that's good news too, right?

348
00:19:08.425 --> 00:19:10.925
It should be a, a sense of fear

349
00:19:10.985 --> 00:19:12.405
and some, some worry about that

350
00:19:12.405 --> 00:19:15.685
because God is seeing everything he's there in it.

351
00:19:15.785 --> 00:19:18.445
But it should also be for those who are his good news.

352
00:19:18.445 --> 00:19:22.625
Because wherever you go, he's there.

353
00:19:24.015 --> 00:19:26.055
Wherever he leads you, he's there.

354
00:19:28.975 --> 00:19:30.385
Like even when we experienced

355
00:19:30.385 --> 00:19:32.105
what we've experienced the last couple days

356
00:19:33.155 --> 00:19:35.465
where things literally feel shaken

357
00:19:37.575 --> 00:19:41.515
and it feels like life is shaking so badly that you can't

358
00:19:42.445 --> 00:19:45.475
stand, listen to this Psalm 46,

359
00:19:48.665 --> 00:19:49.845
God is our refuge

360
00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:53.145
and strength a very present

361
00:19:54.325 --> 00:19:55.535
help in trouble.

362
00:19:57.035 --> 00:19:58.845
Therefore, because he's present,

363
00:19:59.345 --> 00:20:02.565
we will not fear though the earth gives way.

364
00:20:05.515 --> 00:20:06.575
Man, it felt like that.

365
00:20:07.015 --> 00:20:11.935
Saturday morning we will not fear though

366
00:20:11.935 --> 00:20:14.655
the earth gives way though the mountains be moved into the

367
00:20:14.655 --> 00:20:16.575
heart of the sea, though its waters roar

368
00:20:16.575 --> 00:20:19.535
and foam, though its mountains tremble at its swelling.

369
00:20:19.605 --> 00:20:23.855
Like even when the chaos of everything is crushing us,

370
00:20:24.355 --> 00:20:26.735
it seems we will not fear.

371
00:20:26.795 --> 00:20:29.615
Notice why? Because God, our refuge,

372
00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:32.375
our strength is very near.

373
00:20:33.985 --> 00:20:38.475
He's present, he's there. He's keeping you safe.

374
00:20:43.045 --> 00:20:45.585
Now there's, there's one that's really closely linked to

375
00:20:45.585 --> 00:20:48.185
that, that he's all present.

376
00:20:48.495 --> 00:20:52.625
It's that he's, this is the third one. He is omniscient.

377
00:20:54.305 --> 00:20:57.875
Omniscience is our third omni today.

378
00:20:59.935 --> 00:21:01.995
Now you see the word science there, right?

379
00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:08.285
Means knowledge, omni knowledge.

380
00:21:08.385 --> 00:21:10.245
God is all knowing.

381
00:21:13.265 --> 00:21:15.595
He's all powerful. He's all present, he's all knowing.

382
00:21:15.695 --> 00:21:19.555
You see that here in Acts 17 where at the end of

383
00:21:19.555 --> 00:21:21.835
that passage I read it says that God knows the heart

384
00:21:21.835 --> 00:21:25.615
of every person and he will judge the world

385
00:21:25.995 --> 00:21:27.215
in righteousness.

386
00:21:29.245 --> 00:21:31.305
How does he know our hearts? Because he knows everything.

387
00:21:32.865 --> 00:21:34.405
He knows everything that could ever be known.

388
00:21:34.545 --> 00:21:37.645
He also knows the past and he knows the future.

389
00:21:39.355 --> 00:21:42.095
He has an advantage because he's outside of time.

390
00:21:42.605 --> 00:21:47.315
He's timeless. Yet God works

391
00:21:48.535 --> 00:21:50.435
inside within time.

392
00:21:51.075 --> 00:21:55.375
'cause notice it says he has fixed a day, right?

393
00:21:55.375 --> 00:21:59.415
That's time-based He, he's working within the timeline

394
00:21:59.715 --> 00:22:01.055
of history that he created.

395
00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:04.815
He designed, he's outside of it, but he's working within it.

396
00:22:08.275 --> 00:22:12.735
Now, this attribute of God may be more difficult

397
00:22:12.795 --> 00:22:14.695
to grasp than all the others.

398
00:22:16.845 --> 00:22:19.055
They're all interconnected. Yes, they work together.

399
00:22:19.875 --> 00:22:21.815
But this one brings up the most questions.

400
00:22:24.845 --> 00:22:29.425
Now let me be clear. What we don't believe first is

401
00:22:29.425 --> 00:22:32.465
that God is up in heaven merely responding

402
00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:37.045
to things happening down here that's called open theism.

403
00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:39.045
That God doesn't really know what's coming

404
00:22:39.065 --> 00:22:40.565
and so he's just kind of like trying

405
00:22:40.565 --> 00:22:41.725
to catch up in some ways

406
00:22:41.745 --> 00:22:43.725
and making it happen as it's happening.

407
00:22:45.835 --> 00:22:49.345
No, God knows all past, present, future,

408
00:22:49.525 --> 00:22:51.265
he is in control.

409
00:22:53.475 --> 00:22:57.355
But the most common question still sits out there,

410
00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:00.875
okay, if if God knows everything, if God plans,

411
00:23:01.025 --> 00:23:02.035
what about free will?

412
00:23:04.725 --> 00:23:06.485
I mean are, are we just robots then

413
00:23:10.105 --> 00:23:13.475
Like Will will God truly fulfill his promises to us?

414
00:23:13.555 --> 00:23:15.715
I mean we don't really know for sure how

415
00:23:18.005 --> 00:23:21.625
and those are common that all of us, including myself,

416
00:23:21.685 --> 00:23:22.625
we wrestle with,

417
00:23:26.485 --> 00:23:30.975
well one of our favorite Bible characters is named Job.

418
00:23:32.985 --> 00:23:34.365
Job asked questions like that

419
00:23:35.595 --> 00:23:37.265
based on his life and his experiences.

420
00:23:37.855 --> 00:23:38.865
It's in the Old Testament,

421
00:23:38.865 --> 00:23:41.425
but I want you to listen to how God responded to Job.

422
00:23:43.165 --> 00:23:48.115
It says Job chapter 38, this is God speaking

423
00:23:48.175 --> 00:23:50.555
to Job says, where were you when I laid

424
00:23:50.555 --> 00:23:51.755
the foundation of the earth?

425
00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:54.465
Tell me if you have understanding

426
00:23:54.805 --> 00:23:57.585
who determined its measurements, surely you know

427
00:23:58.675 --> 00:24:01.655
or who stretched the line upon it, measured it on

428
00:24:01.655 --> 00:24:04.375
what were its basis sunk its foundations

429
00:24:04.435 --> 00:24:07.055
or who laid its cornerstone?

430
00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:11.835
Have you commanded the mourning since your days began

431
00:24:11.855 --> 00:24:14.395
and caused the dawn to know its place?

432
00:24:16.865 --> 00:24:19.115
Have you entered into the springs of the sea

433
00:24:19.175 --> 00:24:21.115
or walked in the recesses of the deep?

434
00:24:21.345 --> 00:24:23.515
Have the gates of death been revealed to you

435
00:24:23.615 --> 00:24:26.035
or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?

436
00:24:27.085 --> 00:24:29.495
Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth?

437
00:24:30.205 --> 00:24:32.775
Declare if you know all this,

438
00:24:35.095 --> 00:24:36.505
what was God saying to Job?

439
00:24:36.695 --> 00:24:39.265
He's saying, I'm God, you're not.

440
00:24:41.265 --> 00:24:42.725
And he wasn't saying it in like a

441
00:24:42.835 --> 00:24:44.485
sarcastic mean kind of way.

442
00:24:44.515 --> 00:24:46.685
He's just reminding Job, Hey,

443
00:24:47.005 --> 00:24:49.645
I understand this way more than you ever will.

444
00:24:50.395 --> 00:24:53.835
You are limited and Job.

445
00:24:54.225 --> 00:24:57.675
Finally at the course of the the book, he finally realizes

446
00:24:57.675 --> 00:24:59.955
that we need to realize this same thing

447
00:25:00.185 --> 00:25:01.395
that God has God a warn out.

448
00:25:01.395 --> 00:25:02.955
There's gonna be things we don't understand yet.

449
00:25:02.955 --> 00:25:07.195
Hear me in this. It's okay to wrestle

450
00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:08.315
with those questions.

451
00:25:10.805 --> 00:25:13.665
People have done that for thousands of years trying

452
00:25:13.665 --> 00:25:15.745
to figure out how this all works out,

453
00:25:15.745 --> 00:25:17.505
that God is in control and how does this work?

454
00:25:17.605 --> 00:25:20.945
Yes. However, we must take those questions to him

455
00:25:22.615 --> 00:25:26.825
like we need to ask those questions from a posture of faith

456
00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:30.745
where we trust God is actually bigger

457
00:25:30.975 --> 00:25:32.705
that he actually does know

458
00:25:33.005 --> 00:25:36.425
and though I might not be able to conceive, he actually does

459
00:25:36.975 --> 00:25:38.025
know what he's doing.

460
00:25:41.505 --> 00:25:44.045
In fact, I love Richard Baxter's perspective on all this.

461
00:25:44.845 --> 00:25:48.095
He's looking at these essential attributes of who God is

462
00:25:48.805 --> 00:25:50.065
and what our response should be.

463
00:25:50.065 --> 00:25:54.635
This is what he wrote from this greatness

464
00:25:54.855 --> 00:25:56.715
and immensity of God.

465
00:25:57.785 --> 00:26:01.435
Your soul must reverently pause all its busy,

466
00:26:01.945 --> 00:26:06.365
bold inquiries and know that God is to us

467
00:26:06.665 --> 00:26:10.485
and to every creature incomprehensible.

468
00:26:13.725 --> 00:26:16.185
If you could fathom or measure him

469
00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:20.025
and know his greatness by a comprehensive knowledge,

470
00:26:20.405 --> 00:26:21.425
he were not God.

471
00:26:24.365 --> 00:26:27.685
A creature can comprehend nothing but a creature.

472
00:26:30.595 --> 00:26:34.635
You may know God but not comprehend him.

473
00:26:37.085 --> 00:26:41.105
Listen to this part. The ocean is not the ocean if you can

474
00:26:41.105 --> 00:26:42.105
hold it in a spoon.

475
00:26:45.295 --> 00:26:49.315
See, that's the idea here. Our God is like no other church.

476
00:26:51.855 --> 00:26:53.795
His nature is utterly different

477
00:26:55.925 --> 00:26:57.585
and that should cause us to worship.

478
00:26:59.085 --> 00:27:04.035
It should be good news to us that he is this.

479
00:27:07.995 --> 00:27:10.755
But thankfully God also has

480
00:27:10.755 --> 00:27:12.835
what we call relational attributes.

481
00:27:15.205 --> 00:27:16.475
Relational attributes.

482
00:27:16.585 --> 00:27:21.275
This is not just what God is, all powerful, all present,

483
00:27:21.295 --> 00:27:24.875
all knowing He is that this is who God is.

484
00:27:26.795 --> 00:27:28.245
Essential describes his nature,

485
00:27:28.535 --> 00:27:32.645
relational describes his person, how he relates to us,

486
00:27:34.855 --> 00:27:37.835
and again, God is fully these things in himself

487
00:27:37.855 --> 00:27:41.315
and in a sense though he also shares them with us.

488
00:27:42.765 --> 00:27:44.015
They're communicable.

489
00:27:44.015 --> 00:27:46.175
As I said earlier, since we're in his image,

490
00:27:46.555 --> 00:27:49.415
he can share some of these things with us

491
00:27:49.555 --> 00:27:51.535
and so let's look at three of these.

492
00:27:53.075 --> 00:27:56.535
The first and most fundamental is his holiness

493
00:27:59.245 --> 00:28:00.315
relational attribute.

494
00:28:00.315 --> 00:28:01.715
Number one, his holiness.

495
00:28:02.185 --> 00:28:05.235
It's how God revealed himself to Moses, to Isaiah,

496
00:28:05.835 --> 00:28:07.235
I am the holy one.

497
00:28:07.615 --> 00:28:09.755
He says, in fact, later he repeats

498
00:28:09.815 --> 00:28:13.195
and we see in a New Testament be holy because I am holy.

499
00:28:13.455 --> 00:28:17.825
God says, but what is holiness? We need to answer.

500
00:28:17.935 --> 00:28:20.065
What does it mean to be holy?

501
00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:21.825
Well, at its root is separation.

502
00:28:22.295 --> 00:28:24.985
It's difference from other things.

503
00:28:27.975 --> 00:28:30.635
Now, God certainly is that, especially in contrast to us.

504
00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:33.115
We just saw it, right? He is different,

505
00:28:34.515 --> 00:28:37.425
completely different from his creatures worthy of worship

506
00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:41.745
above anything else that was clear in Acts 17, it's all over

507
00:28:41.745 --> 00:28:43.425
that we saw it clearly.

508
00:28:44.015 --> 00:28:47.265
He's also though not just separated from creatures,

509
00:28:47.615 --> 00:28:48.945
he's separated from sin.

510
00:28:51.325 --> 00:28:53.345
He says, we are to be separated from sin as well,

511
00:28:53.405 --> 00:28:56.585
to be different, to conform our lives to him.

512
00:28:56.585 --> 00:28:59.465
That's what Romans 12, two says, don't be conformed

513
00:28:59.465 --> 00:29:02.345
to this world but be transformed by the renewal

514
00:29:02.345 --> 00:29:05.785
of your mind, that by testing you may discern

515
00:29:05.815 --> 00:29:06.945
what is the will of God.

516
00:29:07.095 --> 00:29:10.905
What is good and acceptable and perfect. That's holiness.

517
00:29:10.905 --> 00:29:14.505
Is that your more aligned your your connected

518
00:29:14.965 --> 00:29:18.865
and set apart in the way that

519
00:29:19.445 --> 00:29:23.765
God is Yet again, yes, God calls us

520
00:29:23.765 --> 00:29:27.605
to holiness, but we are unable to be truly

521
00:29:27.745 --> 00:29:30.925
or completely like our Lord in that like Jesus was

522
00:29:31.505 --> 00:29:33.365
his entire life separate.

523
00:29:35.385 --> 00:29:36.515
It's because of our sin,

524
00:29:39.715 --> 00:29:41.405
but that's where we saw in Romans 12.

525
00:29:41.465 --> 00:29:45.205
That's where the grace of God powerfully transforms

526
00:29:46.665 --> 00:29:49.485
us to do that more, to be

527
00:29:50.135 --> 00:29:51.885
separating ourselves from the world,

528
00:29:51.885 --> 00:29:53.645
separating ourselves from our flesh.

529
00:29:53.945 --> 00:29:57.745
That's what God does to communicate that

530
00:29:57.745 --> 00:30:01.025
to us is he makes us wholly

531
00:30:02.375 --> 00:30:07.105
as we separate more, which that leads us

532
00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:09.585
to the second relational attribute we'll look at today is

533
00:30:09.585 --> 00:30:10.705
this idea of righteousness.

534
00:30:13.255 --> 00:30:15.315
God is holy, God is righteous.

535
00:30:17.575 --> 00:30:20.235
The idea here is that God always does what is right

536
00:30:23.325 --> 00:30:24.695
even though we might not understand it,

537
00:30:25.085 --> 00:30:27.095
even though we might not agree with it.

538
00:30:29.125 --> 00:30:30.465
God always does what is right.

539
00:30:30.525 --> 00:30:35.385
He always is just because he's the creator.

540
00:30:36.245 --> 00:30:38.985
He sets the standard for what is right

541
00:30:39.325 --> 00:30:42.945
and what is wrong for how justice is measured out.

542
00:30:42.965 --> 00:30:45.905
The creator has that right to do that,

543
00:30:46.005 --> 00:30:50.425
and so we have to be really careful to sit in judgment over

544
00:30:50.425 --> 00:30:52.145
what we perceive God to be doing

545
00:30:52.525 --> 00:30:54.505
and think that's not right God,

546
00:30:56.115 --> 00:30:59.885
because he always is even in his wrath

547
00:31:00.115 --> 00:31:01.165
towards sin.

548
00:31:01.835 --> 00:31:04.625
It's not anger,

549
00:31:05.295 --> 00:31:06.865
it's not nastiness.

550
00:31:09.715 --> 00:31:13.225
Wrath is an expression of his righteousness.

551
00:31:16.185 --> 00:31:19.155
That disobedience to his will comes at a price.

552
00:31:21.845 --> 00:31:23.375
It's an expression of righteousness

553
00:31:24.675 --> 00:31:26.535
and so how that plays out for us then is it,

554
00:31:26.565 --> 00:31:28.975
it's communicated to us it's slightly different than

555
00:31:28.975 --> 00:31:31.415
holiness against separation from the world.

556
00:31:31.565 --> 00:31:34.495
Righteousness is how we live in the world

557
00:31:36.305 --> 00:31:37.315
that we begin doing

558
00:31:37.465 --> 00:31:40.355
what is right since we now check this out.

559
00:31:40.415 --> 00:31:43.635
God does it right since we are now holy in him.

560
00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:46.675
We're made the righteousness of God in Christ.

561
00:31:46.675 --> 00:31:47.875
Second Corinthians five says,

562
00:31:48.885 --> 00:31:52.695
then we can now act rightly more in this

563
00:31:52.695 --> 00:31:54.255
world like Jesus did.

564
00:31:54.255 --> 00:31:55.935
Right? Jesus was fully set apart,

565
00:31:56.275 --> 00:32:00.495
yet lived it out in a righteous right kind of way.

566
00:32:01.775 --> 00:32:02.995
That's what God does for us.

567
00:32:03.065 --> 00:32:06.635
Sets us apart, makes us holy, so we live it out today.

568
00:32:09.625 --> 00:32:14.395
Here's the third one, goodness, holiness,

569
00:32:14.395 --> 00:32:16.235
righteousness, goodness.

570
00:32:16.295 --> 00:32:17.955
All three of these are very closely related,

571
00:32:18.015 --> 00:32:22.715
but goodness means that God is the final standard of good

572
00:32:24.215 --> 00:32:27.955
and all that he does is worthy of approval.

573
00:32:29.305 --> 00:32:32.755
It's what good means. Now, this is true in a physical sense.

574
00:32:32.755 --> 00:32:33.875
You look back to creation.

575
00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:36.035
Genesis one and two, when God looked at

576
00:32:36.035 --> 00:32:37.915
what he did every day, he stood back

577
00:32:37.935 --> 00:32:39.325
and he said, that's good.

578
00:32:40.255 --> 00:32:43.945
It is good. Like when I grill a steak

579
00:32:44.165 --> 00:32:46.025
and it looks like it does on the plate,

580
00:32:46.145 --> 00:32:47.305
I say, that is good, right?

581
00:32:47.405 --> 00:32:49.305
So that's this similar kind of idea.

582
00:32:49.805 --> 00:32:52.985
God stepped back and he said, that is worthy of approval.

583
00:32:53.165 --> 00:32:56.865
All that I did on day 1, 2, 3, I created it. I did it.

584
00:32:56.865 --> 00:32:59.945
It's good, but that's also true in a moral sense

585
00:33:01.395 --> 00:33:04.245
that everything God does is worthy of approval.

586
00:33:06.845 --> 00:33:09.175
Then when we do the same things he says are good,

587
00:33:09.755 --> 00:33:13.015
we are worthy of approval in that as well.

588
00:33:13.115 --> 00:33:15.375
Yet here's, here's where this one trips us up.

589
00:33:16.605 --> 00:33:18.335
There's a lot of questions that come from this.

590
00:33:19.195 --> 00:33:21.935
If all that God does is worthy of approval,

591
00:33:22.115 --> 00:33:26.515
how could it be good for concentration camps,

592
00:33:29.325 --> 00:33:32.185
tragic deaths, cancer war?

593
00:33:34.885 --> 00:33:37.105
How does that classify as good?

594
00:33:39.965 --> 00:33:41.695
Well, we have to remember sometimes we suffer

595
00:33:41.695 --> 00:33:42.695
because of our own sin.

596
00:33:42.835 --> 00:33:47.465
Yes, but often we suffer just

597
00:33:47.465 --> 00:33:49.545
because we live in a fallen world

598
00:33:52.215 --> 00:33:54.185
that our, that our suffering is not

599
00:33:54.335 --> 00:33:56.305
because we did something at all

600
00:33:59.665 --> 00:34:01.565
and so we, we have to realize that's part of it.

601
00:34:02.305 --> 00:34:03.885
Yes, God does what is good,

602
00:34:04.305 --> 00:34:05.605
but there's also this thing happening

603
00:34:05.605 --> 00:34:06.645
in the world because of sin.

604
00:34:08.075 --> 00:34:09.825
We're also all deserving of death

605
00:34:09.825 --> 00:34:13.435
because of our sin, both physical and spiritual death.

606
00:34:13.575 --> 00:34:15.595
And so this death is coming for all of us.

607
00:34:15.595 --> 00:34:17.555
Jesus gives parable after parable, story

608
00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:19.235
after story of things that that are like, yeah,

609
00:34:19.235 --> 00:34:21.515
it looks tragic, but, but it's just part of the deal

610
00:34:21.515 --> 00:34:25.875
because sin, we're all going to die

611
00:34:25.875 --> 00:34:27.435
and it's not up to us when that happens.

612
00:34:28.945 --> 00:34:30.755
Whether it happened early or late.

613
00:34:32.925 --> 00:34:37.415
Yet, here's the beauty of the gospel is

614
00:34:37.415 --> 00:34:41.055
that God intervened to save us from that

615
00:34:45.635 --> 00:34:46.845
Through the suffering

616
00:34:47.705 --> 00:34:50.605
and sacrifice of his son that everybody else were looked at.

617
00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:53.845
So that's not good and Jesus dying on the cross was actually

618
00:34:53.845 --> 00:34:57.405
the means to bring about good, so it was good.

619
00:34:59.975 --> 00:35:02.275
And when we repent and believe in Jesus' life, death,

620
00:35:02.275 --> 00:35:03.515
and resurrection in our place,

621
00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:05.995
we are spared from the spiritual side of that death.

622
00:35:06.205 --> 00:35:09.315
Maybe the physical side, but for sure the spiritual side

623
00:35:12.625 --> 00:35:15.685
and we know Romans 8 28 says that all things for those

624
00:35:15.925 --> 00:35:18.325
who love God, all things work together for good.

625
00:35:19.875 --> 00:35:20.935
Here's the difference though.

626
00:35:20.935 --> 00:35:23.655
We need to remember that that may not be here

627
00:35:28.005 --> 00:35:29.725
'cause this life is not all there is, right?

628
00:35:30.755 --> 00:35:32.125
That God is preparing us

629
00:35:32.265 --> 00:35:34.725
for something else later, next life to come.

630
00:35:35.195 --> 00:35:39.925
That may be the the good He is working it out to be.

631
00:35:45.645 --> 00:35:46.985
Now, here's the thing I, I know

632
00:35:47.925 --> 00:35:50.135
that all this stuff's pretty high level, like it's easy

633
00:35:50.155 --> 00:35:53.465
to zone out, to check out, to think,

634
00:35:53.465 --> 00:35:54.625
well, this stuff's not important.

635
00:35:54.625 --> 00:35:55.785
This isn't a first thing really.

636
00:35:55.785 --> 00:35:57.905
This is just for theologians to debate and all this stuff.

637
00:35:58.405 --> 00:35:59.985
So why does this even matter?

638
00:36:01.965 --> 00:36:05.805
Why is it, why is this a first thing, the attributes of God?

639
00:36:05.825 --> 00:36:07.885
Why is this so important?

640
00:36:08.995 --> 00:36:10.685
Like isn't it enough just to love Jesus?

641
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:12.405
I mean like that's why we're here.

642
00:36:12.405 --> 00:36:14.125
Just love Jesus and we're moving on. We're good.

643
00:36:14.145 --> 00:36:15.805
I'm gonna get to heaven. Like, uh, isn't that enough?

644
00:36:19.325 --> 00:36:23.185
I want to, I wanna spend a few minutes here showing

645
00:36:23.245 --> 00:36:26.145
how this study of God is so critical for us

646
00:36:27.905 --> 00:36:30.115
because here's the reality of the world that we live in.

647
00:36:31.635 --> 00:36:33.445
There's some spirituality and things like that,

648
00:36:33.585 --> 00:36:36.885
but emphasizes the tangible, the physical,

649
00:36:37.745 --> 00:36:40.285
and here's one way that you can make something of yourself.

650
00:36:40.305 --> 00:36:41.525
You can change the world.

651
00:36:41.665 --> 00:36:43.805
You can, you can rewrite your story.

652
00:36:44.065 --> 00:36:46.045
You can do all of these kinds of things.

653
00:36:46.105 --> 00:36:50.125
You can make it better here as Christians.

654
00:36:50.155 --> 00:36:53.885
That can't be where we land, that it becomes material

655
00:36:54.965 --> 00:36:59.565
only because we worship the God of the universe who sits

656
00:36:59.615 --> 00:37:04.245
above and beyond this world who created this world,

657
00:37:04.245 --> 00:37:08.045
which means he sees this world rightly the way it should.

658
00:37:08.435 --> 00:37:11.685
Plus that means that we can have confidence while we're in

659
00:37:11.685 --> 00:37:13.365
the world because of who he is.

660
00:37:16.235 --> 00:37:19.115
I mean, just think about this. If God was limited like in

661
00:37:19.335 --> 00:37:20.675
Athens to a time

662
00:37:20.935 --> 00:37:25.395
or a place, then we could so easily be separated from him.

663
00:37:26.295 --> 00:37:28.355
We would not be able to have a relationship with him

664
00:37:28.355 --> 00:37:29.555
where he is always with us.

665
00:37:31.065 --> 00:37:31.865
'cause we gotta go to that temple.

666
00:37:31.885 --> 00:37:32.945
We gotta go to that location.

667
00:37:34.505 --> 00:37:37.715
It's critical that we believe God is everywhere.

668
00:37:41.135 --> 00:37:44.765
Think about this. If he was not outside of us,

669
00:37:44.865 --> 00:37:47.885
if he's not other, if he's not outside of creation,

670
00:37:48.755 --> 00:37:51.845
then he couldn't meet us in our suffering

671
00:37:52.145 --> 00:37:54.205
and deliver us from it in Jesus.

672
00:37:56.115 --> 00:37:57.795
'cause he'd be bound up by all of this.

673
00:37:57.905 --> 00:38:01.975
He's gotta be out there. How about this?

674
00:38:03.045 --> 00:38:04.065
If he could change,

675
00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:10.825
then we would not have any assurance of our salvation

676
00:38:13.055 --> 00:38:15.495
'cause what would, what would stop him from just deciding

677
00:38:15.515 --> 00:38:17.775
the next day to say, I really don't wanna save you

678
00:38:17.775 --> 00:38:19.095
all and wipe you out.

679
00:38:21.095 --> 00:38:23.435
If he could change, we would not have any hope

680
00:38:23.435 --> 00:38:24.955
that he's gonna fulfill his promises

681
00:38:24.955 --> 00:38:28.305
because he, we don't know, but he doesn't.

682
00:38:28.655 --> 00:38:33.445
He's the same. And finally, if he was not all powerful

683
00:38:35.435 --> 00:38:37.375
man, then something could trip him up

684
00:38:37.595 --> 00:38:40.615
and cause this whole thing to be derailed from, progressing

685
00:38:40.615 --> 00:38:42.215
to the end that he designed it for.

686
00:38:42.565 --> 00:38:44.295
He's got to be all of these things.

687
00:38:44.295 --> 00:38:46.135
You see how important it is for us to know

688
00:38:46.285 --> 00:38:50.655
what God says about his nature, about what he actually is,

689
00:38:50.845 --> 00:38:53.935
that he's all present, all knowing, all powerful.

690
00:38:55.635 --> 00:38:59.245
That gives us confidence today.

691
00:39:02.225 --> 00:39:04.165
But then think about the relational attributes,

692
00:39:06.425 --> 00:39:07.565
how we relate to him.

693
00:39:09.185 --> 00:39:10.915
He's holy, he's righteous, he's good.

694
00:39:10.935 --> 00:39:13.675
He wants us to be those as well that pleases him in it.

695
00:39:13.695 --> 00:39:16.995
Yet the beauty here, this the beauty of what God has

696
00:39:17.665 --> 00:39:21.595
said here, who he is, is that he provides

697
00:39:21.695 --> 00:39:24.515
for us everything that he requires of us.

698
00:39:28.215 --> 00:39:30.505
He's made us His holy children

699
00:39:31.185 --> 00:39:34.745
planting His Holy Spirit in us, empowering us to live a life

700
00:39:34.855 --> 00:39:39.065
that is righteous, which leads us to be good in our lives.

701
00:39:39.275 --> 00:39:41.345
Where our lives align with what he wants.

702
00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:46.525
That's what he's done and what he is doing in us.

703
00:39:47.675 --> 00:39:49.255
So it's critical that we know he's holy,

704
00:39:49.255 --> 00:39:50.335
that we know he is righteous.

705
00:39:50.335 --> 00:39:52.055
You know he is good because that makes us

706
00:39:52.205 --> 00:39:53.255
able to be that way.

707
00:39:53.255 --> 00:39:57.365
Then plus, listen, if,

708
00:39:58.185 --> 00:40:02.455
if we didn't truly know the nature of his love,

709
00:40:05.445 --> 00:40:07.055
we'd have every reason to be afraid of him.

710
00:40:10.475 --> 00:40:12.735
But because we know he is love,

711
00:40:14.065 --> 00:40:15.525
we have no reason to be afraid.

712
00:40:17.585 --> 00:40:20.315
He's a consuming fire to devour our sin,

713
00:40:20.535 --> 00:40:24.515
but his nature is essentially love.

714
00:40:28.135 --> 00:40:30.315
We can come without fear.

715
00:40:33.395 --> 00:40:36.655
See, this is the beauty of studying his attributes.

716
00:40:39.265 --> 00:40:40.885
We understand our relationship

717
00:40:40.885 --> 00:40:43.365
with him much more clearly when we understand first

718
00:40:43.365 --> 00:40:44.645
that he's different from us,

719
00:40:44.905 --> 00:40:47.405
but then how he relates to us in spite of that,

720
00:40:48.265 --> 00:40:51.405
how he brings us to himself as his children

721
00:40:51.405 --> 00:40:53.725
because he loves us because of his grace.

722
00:40:54.755 --> 00:40:58.165
Like should this not lead us to be stunned in worship,

723
00:40:58.225 --> 00:41:01.365
should not lead us to be faithful in our living.

724
00:41:03.035 --> 00:41:04.205
This is who our God is.
