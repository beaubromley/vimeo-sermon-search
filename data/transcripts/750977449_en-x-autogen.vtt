00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, let's get going here.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.300
Thank you for being here.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.800
There's

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.100
a handful of you here grateful for

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.200
that

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.400
No, this is this is critically important this night as

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.200
a whole is really critically important for what

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.500
we're doing. So, let me just make again a

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400
reminder that if you're unaware, there are other seminars going

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.000
on at the same time right now.

11
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.400
various ages and stages of life and parenting

12
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.200
And so let me just walk through those if you want to jump out. I'm

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.300
not gonna be offended clearly by you getting up and going

14
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.400
if you want to to these here's the other four

15
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.000
that are going on right now that you could

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.500
jump into we have one centered on Foster and

17
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.200
adoption. And so if you're interested in that or have done that there's one

18
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.800
of those and it's in w 100 I believe. Is that side down

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.100
right behind the wall over there.

20
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.600
K through fifth grade if you land in

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.400
that and want to kind of talk through that that's in the activity center.

22
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.800
Down there by the cafe that's there birth through

23
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.000
Pre-K. If you're kind of focused on

24
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.700
that as parents that's w-204, which is go out

25
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400
here go up the stairs. It's right behind the wall upstairs right there.

26
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.100
And then a student like teen parents

27
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.500
would be in w202 which

28
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.400
is upstairs right there as well. So foster adoption K

29
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.300
through fifth birth to pre-k student

30
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.500
all that. You can find your way if that's

31
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.600
where you would rather fit. Feel free to get up and go people out

32
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.300
there in the lobby could also point you directional if you

33
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
need that but those are more specific if you want to stand here. That's fine.

34
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.600
I'm gonna talk through some things a little more generically

35
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600
generally, but you can you can

36
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.900
stay here of course or go.

37
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.100
But here's what we're going to do in here tonight. So as

38
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.600
we talk about parent the importance

39
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.700
of parenting even grandparenting a

40
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.700
little bit Guardians, if you're guardians of

41
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.200
children or teens this is going

42
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.600
to apply.

43
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.900
Because what we believe here are thesis I

44
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.500
guess you'd say as as a church. Our

45
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.900
desire is that parents are

46
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.300
the primary spiritual influencers in

47
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.700
our own kids lives.

48
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.100
That no other influence comes remotely close.

49
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.400
To that influence in a life in these these

50
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.400
children. No one comes close to matching that

51
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.900
and so what we don't want to do as a church is take

52
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.600
that responsibility away from you.

53
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.500
We don't want to try to replace that.

54
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.300
And so what we're trying to shift to is more of

55
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.400
a family equipping model where we are equipping families

56
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.300
equipping parents.

57
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.400
To to be Primary in their own kids lives and we

58
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.400
as a church come alongside that where we don't take the place

59
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.200
of we come alongside those who are

60
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.500
parenting. And so that's what this parenting equipping night

61
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.000
is for. That's why we started this we're going to

62
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.500
do a number of things regularly like this throughout the year.

63
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.500
Resourcing encouraging training all of

64
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.100
that to try to really come alongside parents and and

65
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.300
help them. And so one of the things we've done

66
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.600
that's a really simple way for you as parents at the

67
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.500
bottom of the sermon notes every week. So whether

68
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.200
you do it on the on the app, or you print them out at home

69
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.500
or you have there's at each entrance, there's

70
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.400
stacks of them that you can grab on the way in for Sundays

71
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.200
at the bottom of those and we post them on social media

72
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.300
as well at the bottom is what we call TalkBack questions.

73
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.300
Really simple three simple questions. They're nothing

74
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.100
profound, right? You're just going to have a

75
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.400
starter question or two or three

76
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.900
for you as a family. So imagine at

77
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.600
lunch. You've all just heard the same

78
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.400
message and you go home and you talk about it over

79
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.000
lunch or that evening or next day or whatever.

80
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.700
That's one of those ways to just take a baby step towards

81
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.400
family equipping so take advantage

82
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.400
of those things. Those are simple ways. It doesn't take much to ask a

83
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.800
question and see where it goes and God does a lot with that. But

84
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.600
again that all goes back to that really the desire

85
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.500
we have is to equip parents and come alongside

86
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.600
parents towards that end.

87
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.300
as we as a church support that

88
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.300
and so what I want to do tonight

89
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.700
Really just laying out groundwork foundational elements

90
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.500
many of you are in very different stages of

91
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.800
parenting. It's not this is the hard hard

92
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.700
one because we're all a mishmash of

93
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.500
stages where we're at. But this will

94
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.200
apply a thank you have if you

95
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.300
have kids at home, of course, this will apply if you have kids that

96
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.600
are now out of the house and kind of how do you parent from afar

97
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.300
then it will be for you who are grandparents

98
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.600
and you're influencing your grandkids in new ways and and then

99
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.200
just generically spiritual parenting and

100
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.300
grandparenting in the church.

101
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.800
Right. This is something that we have as a responsibility together first

102
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.500
as parents of children, but then

103
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.100
in the church context where we're coming

104
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.600
around parents and discipling their kids

105
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.100
alongside them. So this is going to

106
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.300
be something that I hope will cross over all those boundaries.

107
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.400
And we're going to talk through some important pieces of that but then I think the

108
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.500
best way for these type of things to work is for just Q&amp;A.

109
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.300
Right. So we're going to try to leave some time at the end for some good

110
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.500
amount of Q&amp;A to make it relevant. Like I might

111
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.700
cover what I think is important, but what do

112
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.000
you think's important? What do you want to know about and I might not have the best

113
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.500
answer. We've got Collective wisdom in the room that can help us answer

114
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.400
that but I want to leave time for that. Make sure

115
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.400
it works. So begin to think a questions now or along

116
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.100
the way and we'll try to see what God's word says

117
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.400
about that.

118
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.100
But what we're going to do to get there is we're going to start by

119
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.400
going to God's word Ephesians 6:4 so pull out your copy of

120
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.500
God's word and turn there with me.

121
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.400
Ephesians 6:4 there's a lot of ways we could go with this

122
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.300
a lot of places we could land in Scripture.

123
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.500
But I'm gonna read all of verse 4.

124
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.900
And then we're going to come back through it piece by piece.

125
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.300
Ephesians 6:4

126
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.600
Says fathers do not provoke your children to

127
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.100
anger.

128
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.600
But bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the

129
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.900
Lord.

130
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.200
Fathers do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the discipline and

131
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.800
instruction of the Lord Ephesians 6:4.

132
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.200
So remember the way that Ephesians is structured.

133
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.400
Where the first three chapters are Paul's summary

134
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.900
of The Gospel.

135
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.600
The implications of that for our Salvation And how that fleshes out

136
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.800
in our lives. So rich first three

137
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.700
chapters would be worth your year of study.

138
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.900
But then the last three chapters of Ephesians are its outflow

139
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.700
the gospels outflow in life, like

140
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.500
practical a lot of day-to-day things

141
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.700
in the church in relationships in prayer

142
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.200
in work, all of that comes out

143
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.800
of this idea of the gospel outflow.

144
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.100
And so then not only does he talked about all that stuff.

145
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.300
He talks about marriage. He talks about parenting.

146
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.600
Applying the gospel into those elements.

147
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.800
That's what this section is.

148
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.600
Because of what God has done for us.

149
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.300
Parents do this right? Like this is a response to

150
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.100
the gospel. Just like all the rest of it is.

151
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.100
So let's look at it. Let's dig into a first he says fathers

152
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.900
and that's a legitimate translation of

153
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.700
the Greek text. It's pateir fathers.

154
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.400
Now as he says this does this exempt

155
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.100
mothers from this role? Well, no, of course

156
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.600
obviously mothers have a critical role in parenting.

157
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.700
In instructing and disciplining children as well.

158
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.000
But what he's doing here is he's highlighting this expectation.

159
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.400
That's throughout scripture.

160
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.600
That fathers have the leading responsibility in

161
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:05.800
the home.

162
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.300
Not the only but the leading responsibility in the home to

163
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.800
carry this burden in the first and foremost

164
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.800
kind of way to Shepherd to Pastor

165
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.200
them as his children.

166
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.000
So let that be first and primary right?

167
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.100
Let's let's make sure that can be as ideal

168
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.400
as it can but I also realize that's not everybody's situation.

169
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.500
We have a lot of things that are different than

170
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.200
that ideal certainly, but we want to

171
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.200
push towards that and and disciple people towards that

172
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.300
yes, but there's a whole lot of unique situations around.

173
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.100
And so tonight just for the context of this we're going to think of the

174
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.100
word parents here who says fathers. Yes. We

175
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.400
know what that means. But that this is for all of us.

176
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.300
He says parents possibly even grandparents or

177
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.200
Guardians if that's the situation that you're in and that's how

178
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.300
you can have influence on these kids that God's entrusted to

179
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.400
us. Then let that be who you are reading this as right.

180
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.300
so parents

181
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.600
grandparents Guardians Ephesians 6:4 then

182
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.300
says God's word says do not provoke your

183
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.800
children to anger.

184
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.900
Some translations say Do not exasperate your

185
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.300
children.

186
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.200
We don't talk really like that anymore. We don't use that word very

187
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.500
often.

188
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.800
Basically, all that means is do not come alongside your

189
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.300
children and make them angry.

190
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.500
That word for provoking to anger is this you

191
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.900
come alongside them and anger them?

192
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.900
Not just from afar. You're actually with them. And so

193
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.300
Don't provoke them to anger is what God's word says

194
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.500
now, here's the reality of this. We know that most children get

195
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.000
upset when you discipline them, right?

196
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.300
They don't look at you and say thank you. Like that's not what

197
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.600
they do. So there's an anger that just naturally comes

198
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:56.900
up.

199
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.400
And he even says here in six four includes the word discipline.

200
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.200
So he's not talking about.

201
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.600
Completely abdicating discipline from your

202
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.000
life so that you don't anchor them.

203
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.300
Like well, I can never correct them because that's gonna anger them. That's

204
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.000
not what he's saying here, right?

205
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.800
So what does this mean?

206
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.100
What kind of things is he talking about here?

207
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.000
We don't want to provoke them to anger. That's what he says not to do. And so what's

208
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.900
he talking about? We're gonna be real practical here.

209
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.800
Well, here's here's the the primary way. This applies first

210
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.800
and foremost this means

211
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.500
That you take your faith seriously yourself.

212
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.200
So that they don't see a disconnect between the way

213
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.500
you live out there and the way you live at home.

214
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.000
Because think about that.

215
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.400
I'm not saying you have to be academic or overly religious

216
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.200
or you got to be weird about your faith. I'm not saying any of

217
00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.100
those things. You just make it your number one priority revolve

218
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.900
everything around else around it in public in

219
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.400
private at church not at church,

220
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.200
right? You're making it. Look this is

221
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.500
the same everywhere. You're making it normal because here's what

222
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.500
happens your kids and everybody around you

223
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.400
really but talking kids primarily they pick

224
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.000
up on that stuff.

225
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.000
They pick up on that. They see it.

226
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.000
And the reality is your discipling your kids one way or the other.

227
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.400
Like towards something you want or away from

228
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.400
that thing that that you're you're training them

229
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.100
in a way to put their church hat on

230
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.200
when they go to church, but then the rest of their life they can do whatever they

231
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:40.600
want with it.

232
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.300
You're in a sense discipling them towards that

233
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.900
as their lifestyle.

234
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.300
And you wonder why we have so many people leaving the church.

235
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.600
In droves over the last Decades of

236
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.600
people who grew up in the church, like where why

237
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.600
are they leaving? Why are they why are they saying they

238
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.200
don't believe in God anymore? Why is that the case well, because

239
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.700
a lot of it is due to this.

240
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.800
They saw their parents.

241
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.200
live one way publicly or live one way at church and

242
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.400
then

243
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.100
not at home at all.

244
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.400
It's not the only reason don't think it's like don't I'm not heaping

245
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.200
shame on you if that's what you see your kid walking away. That's not

246
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.200
only the reason.

247
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.800
But it's a big reason.

248
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.500
because they say

249
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.900
to you as a parent like it didn't matter to you.

250
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.000
and they just do it because they have to till they get out of the house and

251
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.700
they're just gonna do what you did and we play a game.

252
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.500
Religiously publicly, but then we do it our own way and

253
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.100
and the further that gets away from the source the

254
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.900
less that's going to happen.

255
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.900
And so we should not as children. They should not question whether

256
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.400
you really believe the stuff

257
00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:58.700
or not.

258
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.900
There shouldn't be a disconnect between the way we are publicly the

259
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.200
way we are at church. They should have no question that

260
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.900
that's really

261
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.000
Really what you believe?

262
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.700
That means it must be the priority of your life first.

263
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.600
Should be number one in your heart.

264
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.100
Because if we have this command do not provoke your children

265
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.200
to anger one way that happens is when they

266
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.200
see the disconnect.

267
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.100
They see that you're different over here than you are over here. They see

268
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.400
that you're more kind to people in this circle because

269
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.600
it's public and you're just a jerk to them.

270
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.000
Like, you know Europe it's okay not to be

271
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.100
okay here. So I'm leading out in that there was a there was

272
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.300
a time.

273
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.300
Where my wife asked me this question?

274
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.900
I'm trying to think how long it was when I was at Weatherford. So

275
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.200
eight ten years ago somewhere in there.

276
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.800
And she asked this question. Why are you more alive

277
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.800
at church than you are at home?

278
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.900
like talk about that just

279
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.500
shot to the gut

280
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.600
that that I get in this world and I'm alive and

281
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.700
I'm interacting with people all the time and I'm just destroyful over

282
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.000
but you know over the top right and and then

283
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.900
I get home and I'm just like

284
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.900
phone, you know, whatever.

285
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.400
She noticed which means my boys were not old enough yet to really see

286
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.300
all that thankfully, but she could see that the trend was

287
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.300
negative towards that and it called me out.

288
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.100
So are you the same?

289
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.700
home

290
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.200
At work as you are around the people

291
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.200
that you're supposed to put the front on with right.

292
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.200
Let's not make it a different thing. Let's make it the same kids pick up on

293
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.600
that that increases their provocation towards anger because

294
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.700
they just resent.

295
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.300
What they see.

296
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.400
So you take your faith. Seriously number one, that's number one

297
00:14:59.400 --> 00:14:59.900
for you.

298
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.100
Second here's another practical way to avoid provoking them to

299
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.400
anger.

300
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.000
Don't be overbearing.

301
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.100
Don't be overbearing with your kids or grandkids or

302
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.600
whoever.

303
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.400
Now it's one thing as he says to bring them up in

304
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.700
the discipline instruction of the Lord. We'll get to that in a little bit.

305
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.300
It's another thing to come down hard on everything they

306
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:23.500
do.

307
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.000
If you if you if you expect perfection.

308
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.700
Out of a child or a teenager they will fail you.

309
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:35.700
every time

310
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:39.900
and they'll feel that.

311
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.100
when you nitpick every little thing that they do

312
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.200
Like and hear me again as a type A personality. This

313
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.600
is really hard for me to let go of

314
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.800
and he's going to do it a little differently than I am.

315
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.600
And I'm it's hard for me not to try to control that.

316
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.300
And nitpick it and and just kind of come down on every little

317
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.600
thing.

318
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.500
I have to let that go but if I expect Perfection out

319
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.400
of a nine-year-old, it's like

320
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.200
I'm not even perfect. I can't expect

321
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.200
Perfection of myself. So let alone somebody who has no

322
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.300
idea how the world Works yet.

323
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.000
But the more you do this the more you come down on everything

324
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.100
the more you're overbearing the more they

325
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.400
resent everything about

326
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.600
that.

327
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.500
It provokes anger, they'll shut down and

328
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.500
they'll be angry about most everything.

329
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.400
I said there's a lot of places we could go for this tonight. It's what Colossians

330
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.500
3:21 says.

331
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.200
It's almost the exact similarity to Ephesians 6:4.

332
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.300
But here in Colossians, it adds a result.

333
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.100
It says do not provoke your children.

334
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.400
Lest they become discouraged.

335
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.400
So it's not just about like provoking them to

336
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:03.600
anger.

337
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.300
He says you're going to provoke them to anger and they're going to get discouraged.

338
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.600
They will become discouraged because of these

339
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.200
things so our job should be

340
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.400
to encourage not to discourage.

341
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.400
To add courage not take away courage from our

342
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.000
children.

343
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.800
And if we're overbearing it will discourage because

344
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.600
they can never win. They can never speak successful. They

345
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.300
can never measure up.

346
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.200
And it's always you're always failing and that's just

347
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.400
discouraging to everybody.

348
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.500
Now here's a third way to avoid provoking them

349
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.100
to anger.

350
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.200
I'm going to show you a video to get us there, but I want to set

351
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.400
it up first before we show it.

352
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.800
This is going to be.

353
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.700
Kind of a psychologist observing a

354
00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.300
psychologist experiment.

355
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.300
So he's watching this experiment happen and he's commenting on

356
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.400
it from an outsider's perspective.

357
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.500
but the whole experiment originally was

358
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.700
was watching and testing how children

359
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.900
react to facial expressions and

360
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.600
engagement with a parent.

361
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.500
I remember the first time I saw this it just blew me away to watch

362
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.400
this and you'll see it in a moment. It's profound but but the

363
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.300
person you see Talking there's actually captions on

364
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.300
it. But the person you see Talking is Dr. David

365
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.000
pooter I think is how you

366
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.800
say his name, but

367
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.100
He's a psychologist in California. I would

368
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.400
not recommend listening to him. Like

369
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.200
don't go find his body. Like that's not what we're doing with this. This is

370
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.300
not an endorsement of him, but it is

371
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.600
really an amazing Glimpse from

372
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.300
his perspective psychologically to know what's happening

373
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.200
in this experiment and we'll take what he says with

374
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.100
a grain of salt. There's still some stuff, of course in this that we want

375
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.800
to be careful with.

376
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.400
But what I want you to observe in this is

377
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.400
is how the child responds.

378
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.500
And you'll see what I mean when we get to it, but we're gonna

379
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.200
watch the video. I'll come back explain how it applies what we're talking about here

380
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.100
tonight, but just watch the child. You'll see what I mean.

381
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.400
Today I'm going to go through one of my favorite videos a

382
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.000
video that literally changed my life. When I saw this the first

383
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.700
time I watched it probably 10 times in a row because there

384
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.400
was so much going on psychologically and so

385
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.400
much that just my eyes opened about how sophisticated

386
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.600
Young children one year olds are at

387
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.200
regaining connection with their mother. And so I'm just going

388
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.200
to start it right here. And in the very beginning we can see how

389
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.800
the mother and the infant are playing wonderfully together. So the

390
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.400
the mothers moving her hands the babies moving

391
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.200
her hands the baby looks over at something the

392
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.300
baby looks at the mother the eyebrows go

393
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.500
up the baby. The mother's eyebrows go up the baby points mother looks

394
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.100
so they're interacting. This is what play looks like.

395
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.600
This is what a well-connected child with her mother looks like Mother's tickling

396
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.400
the child the child giggles and laughs the

397
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.200
child. It looks at

398
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.500
the mother looks away a little bit mother. Okay. Not

399
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.600
now, I'm gonna pause it right here. So in the experiment what

400
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.100
happens is they ask the mother to have a

401
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.600
still face hence still face experiment. And so they ask

402
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.700
her to look at the child but to completely go

403
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.500
flat, okay.

404
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.200
Here we go. The mother looks flat at the child

405
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.600
the baby kind of like

406
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.900
doesn't quite know what to do. Does this little feigning.

407
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.300
Look puts the puts his arm up because usually

408
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.200
that engages play, okay.

409
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.600
Next the baby points because that usually engages

410
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.100
play.

411
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.400
But the mother has his still face yet. Okay. Now the baby

412
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.000
tries to reach to mother to reengage her

413
00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.900
now right here. I'm pausing it. You can see a Grimace

414
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.900
on an expression of anger on this

415
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.500
infant's face and the

416
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.500
infant is trying to reconnect but it's not

417
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.100
able to reconnect

418
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.400
Okay, and so the the infant goes from like a playful way

419
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.500
of re-engaging connection to more of an angry.

420
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.900
Fight and flight way of reengaging connection, okay.

421
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.500
So the infant is making some loud screeching noises. The infant is

422
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:28.900
clapping.

423
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.400
Making loud noises now watch this right here the

424
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:34.700
infant.

425
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.000
bites himself

426
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.500
I'm positive again. This is the beginning

427
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.300
of self-harm.

428
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.900
This infant is harming himself as a way of distress because

429
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.000
he is distressed.

430
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.600
Because he's distressed due to a lack

431
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.400
of connection a lack of mirroring a lack

432
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.900
of play a lack of being able to re-engage his mother. Okay, let's

433
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.200
continue.

434
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.400
So now the infant reaches to his mother doesn't work.

435
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.900
So the infant starts to look away.

436
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.100
So the infant now is body is contorting.

437
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.500
He's lost body posture.

438
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.300
and it's really interesting because the baby is going

439
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.400
from a kind of a fight and flight place to a shutdown

440
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.100
okay to more of a dissociative place to a

441
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.600
place of

442
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.100
having its body be

443
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.200
discombobulated or disoriented so it starts by

444
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.000
looking away avoidance, right and then just kind of

445
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.200
like

446
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.100
a decelibate posturing

447
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.100
the child is very strict distressed. Now. I want you to watch I'm playing this

448
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:41.200
now.

449
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.700
The mother re-engage the child. So this is a healthily.

450
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.800
Attached mom healthy secure attachment and look the

451
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.000
baby goes back to marrying the baby goes back to play immediately.

452
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.100
The baby puts its arms up mother puts his

453
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.100
arms up baby with some down mother put their arms down. They go

454
00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.900
back to marrying.

455
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.500
So this video teaches us a couple really really important

456
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.600
things not only about how to interact

457
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.100
with our children.

458
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.800
But also how to play Not only

459
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.500
with children but also with our spouses with our

460
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.300
loved ones and with our patients, right? So a lot

461
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.500
of play is marrying. It's looking

462
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.000
at each other's emotions. It's looking

463
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.600
at each other's desires, right the baby points mother

464
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.100
looks

465
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.300
your spouse points at something interesting. You look. Oh,

466
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.100
yeah, that's interesting.

467
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.100
Often though. What happens is we get

468
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.000
in our own head, right? So getting in our own

469
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.600
head keeps us from being able to play, you know, getting into our own ego as

470
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.200
the cloak wheel term would describe ego. You know, when you're

471
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.200
thinking only of yourself, it's really hard to think of

472
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.200
your spouse. It's really hard to think of your patient.

473
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:49.300
so

474
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.000
Coming back to what are the body languages? What

475
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.600
are the micro Expressions? What is this person Desiring

476
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.400
and then getting excited or

477
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.000
enthusiastic or plain with

478
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.300
them? Right? It's kind of like entering into

479
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.500
that moment. So as you looked at that video and rewatch this

480
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.400
a couple times think about one, what would a depressed

481
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.400
mother look like what we know they would be less emotionally engaged

482
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.400
compared to a normal mother. What would

483
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.500
an alcoholic or a drug abusing mother or father look

484
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.500
like with their child. We know once again, there are

485
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.000
less engaged.

486
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.300
And imagine, you know a parent

487
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.200
always on their phone. Okay. I know when I go

488
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.000
on my phone around my kids they may get more agitated early

489
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.200
on maybe they're getting into that more fight and flight

490
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.300
stage and whereas if I'm playing, you know, and we're

491
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.300
sitting down doing some Legos and I'm mirroring them. It's like all fun. It's

492
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.300
like they're totally engaged in that playful state.

493
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.300
okay, so the trick with both our kids our spouses our

494
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.000
patients is

495
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.200
To remain in this playful State. Okay, and

496
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.300
to enter into someone else's exuberance.

497
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.500
And if you notice that at one point the child needed some

498
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.200
space and the mother gave him some space.

499
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.400
So we want to both marry each other.

500
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.700
and to connect

501
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.500
and that's what this video taught me like no other

502
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:10.900
video has

503
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.200
today

504
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.600
is that not profound to watch happen

505
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.800
instantly, right?

506
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.800
But there's so many applications here.

507
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.600
Is called the still face experiment. You can go find even lengthier videos

508
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.200
on that online. You can go find that as you need

509
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:33.400
to.

510
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.600
But here's what I believe it. It shows us for our purposes

511
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:37.900
here tonight.

512
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.800
One of the ways as we look at Ephesians 6:4

513
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.100
that we can provoke our children to anger or we can

514
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.500
exasperate our children. One of the ways is

515
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.800
by disengaging from their lives.

516
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.600
And so this applies not just for those of us with little kids

517
00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.100
this applies for you with your grandkids this

518
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.100
applies for you with your adult kids. It applies for

519
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.600
you with your spouse you with friends you with other

520
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.200
family like this is this is so much bigger than

521
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.500
just parenting right now, right?

522
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.400
because that applies in every

523
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.200
relationship we have

524
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.200
and so for our kids, for example, we can disconnect ourselves

525
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.200
from them emotionally.

526
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.600
Whether the babies or whether they're teenagers and you

527
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.300
see their natural response to that.

528
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.200
We know it's true. Like inherently when we start to think about it like

529
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.200
that. Yeah, of course, we see that happen, and then they disconnect from

530
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.600
us and they just completely pull away

531
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.100
and they don't want to have anything and listen if they

532
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:41.700
don't want to talk to you.

533
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.400
That's a closed door to so many other things.

534
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.300
If they have disengaged because you disengage with them. That's

535
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.500
a problem for the future.

536
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.300
That they might listen, but they won't hear you.

537
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.300
They might have to do what they have to do. But as

538
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.200
soon as they're having the ability to get out of the house, they're

539
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.500
out and they're never coming back.

540
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.500
And so instead what do we do?

541
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.600
If we don't want to exasperate or

542
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.900
provoke them to anger.

543
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.600
We don't want to disengage from their life. What do we do instead? We

544
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.400
must Delight in our children in

545
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:23.900
our teens.

546
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.900
You heard the doctors say that right to?

547
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.900
To enjoy them to get involved in

548
00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.000
their exuberance and be a part of

549
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.800
their lives mirror play all of those things. I would

550
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.700
say it like this. He said this to be curious.

551
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:41.900
about their interests

552
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.000
if you have multiple kids, you know, every one of them is different.

553
00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.200
Your grandkids you look at every one of them is different.

554
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.300
And what worked with this one doesn't work with this one and what they're excited

555
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.000
about is not what they're excited about. So you have to be curious and

556
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.300
ask about who they are and what

557
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.900
God's made them to enjoy and that inclines their

558
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.000
heart towards you and towards the Lord.

559
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:07.800
in that desire

560
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.800
So we have to engage their lives.

561
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.500
We see the results of what happens when we don't even from a

562
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:18.900
baby.

563
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.800
Just think about your teenagers.

564
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.800
So what we have to do then we've got to meet their emotional needs.

565
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.000
So we provide for our kids physically.

566
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.000
hopefully spiritually

567
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.000
just as much as we do that we have to provide for them emotionally.

568
00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.200
I've got a simple chart here that I want to show you and I talk through

569
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.000
that's along these same lines. I don't know if we'll be able to

570
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.900
see every piece you can see some of it.

571
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.300
But this deals with relational needs.

572
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.600
And it kind of goes with the video. We just saw and how you would

573
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.300
think about that. There are relational needs that every

574
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.500
person has especially our kids and our grandkids those

575
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.100
around us.

576
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.500
So you've got two tracks here. There's a potential of

577
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.200
needs met. That's the top. That's the green that if

578
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.400
you're going to meet those needs, here's the track. We'll talk about a second in

579
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.900
the bottom. The red is the pain of needs missed.

580
00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.100
We'll talk about what happens there. But think about

581
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.300
that as a relational need with you and a

582
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.800
kid you and a teenager.

583
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.300
Let's say they meet you meet that need and

584
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.400
you're engaged with them and you're involved that need is

585
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:27.600
met.

586
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.300
That leads that child to think truthful things

587
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.400
to think right things about what's happening right now and

588
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.500
and what you would tell them that they're thinking

589
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.500
in a right sense of the word. They also have been positive feelings as

590
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.100
a result of that.

591
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.100
That they they get this from you and their needs met and they're thinking

592
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.700
rightly and then they have positive feelings because of that that leads

593
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.800
to productive behaviors.

594
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.600
It doesn't guarantee that they're going to obey everything you say because they're kids

595
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.700
they're not perfect, but it leads a lot more to productive

596
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.000
behaviors and then positive outcomes on the

597
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:00.700
other end, right?

598
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.000
That's if the needs are met.

599
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.800
But what about the pain of needs that are missed? It's

600
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.200
just the flip side of that that need is unmet.

601
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.100
You've disengaged you're on your phone all the time

602
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.700
that that engagement the care the the

603
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.300
time with them the Curiosity about

604
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.400
them that has not been met and that kid feels alone that

605
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.600
kid feels like they have nothing.

606
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.500
To meet their need relationally that need is unmet leads

607
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.000
to faulty thinking.

608
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.600
They might I don't think they love me. There's nobody

609
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.000
loves me.

610
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.100
Nobody cares about me.

611
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.800
I'm worthless.

612
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.600
Faulty thinking leads to painful feelings.

613
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.600
That they then feel inside that they have because

614
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.000
of that faulty thinking and it

615
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.700
leads to an emotional state. That's

616
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.100
painful

617
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.900
Which leads to unproductive behaviors?

618
00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.300
And negative outcomes.

619
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.700
Right. What was amazing? He mentioned this. He stopped the video when the child bit

620
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.400
itself because it didn't know what to do with this

621
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.800
emotional disengagement.

622
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.800
It went through that really fast. The need was not met it began

623
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.100
to think.

624
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.400
Nothing, really. I don't know what to do with this. So painful feelings led

625
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.500
to unproductive behaviors. Like I'm scared. I'm

626
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.300
despite my hand.

627
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.300
And we just exponentially.

628
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.900
Scope that out for a teenager.

629
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.000
So this is a way for us to think okay emotional needs

630
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.400
matter.

631
00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.300
Engagement with a child matters clearly

632
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.300
not meeting relational emotional needs sets our children

633
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.400
up to be angry and to be separated from us.

634
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.900
Are teenagers it sets them up?

635
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.300
to be angry to be exasperated as scripture says not

636
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:53.700
to be

637
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.800
And here's what happens. We we track this negative behavior

638
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.600
down here the negative outcomes the unproductive

639
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.400
behaviors. What often happens?

640
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.100
Whenever we see a child or a teen show one

641
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.600
of those unproductive behaviors.

642
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.700
We try to swoop in at that moment and correct it.

643
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.200
We truth the deed you would say.

644
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.200
They did something and we throw a bunch of Truth on top of it to try

645
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:25.700
to fix it.

646
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.000
You know, you're not supposed to do that.

647
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.400
Haven't I told you not to do that before, you know, that's gonna be wrong. You

648
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.200
know, that's gonna be terrible for you. Like why would you do that that

649
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.300
we truth the deed even throwing Jesus on

650
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.700
top of that sometimes right? We truth the deed we

651
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.200
tell them how to fix it instead. Maybe what we

652
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.700
need to do is go back and meet the need.

653
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.500
That led down that negative track.

654
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.200
That they weren't getting something emotionally relationally from

655
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.300
you. So they ran down this faulty thinking

656
00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.500
this feelings and they added the behavior

657
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.000
on top of it.

658
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.900
When maybe we should have gone back and met a need to begin with.

659
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.700
Meet the need don't just truth the deed.

660
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:14.300
so

661
00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.000
instead of provoking them to anger as

662
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.500
scripture just said not to do.

663
00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.800
Were commanded here in Ephesians 6:4. Let's

664
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.500
continue the verse.

665
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.600
Bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the

666
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:30.900
Lord.

667
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.700
Bring them up in the discipline and instruction of

668
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.100
the Lord.

669
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.200
And here's what's interesting that word for bring them up in Ephesians.

670
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.500
6:4 is the same word that is used to

671
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.700
nourish in a physical way.

672
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.800
So you're like I said before feeding them.

673
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.200
You're making sure their needs are met that they're safe. They're

674
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.500
protected you have that you're also.

675
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.700
Nourishing them in the discipline and instruction of

676
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.400
the Lord spiritually you're called to

677
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.000
nourish them. That's our primary responsibility parents.

678
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.000
Hours not the churches. It's ours as

679
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.700
parents to nourish them spiritually the leading responsibility

680
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.200
in our homes as parents is to Pastor

681
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.600
them to lead them toward Jesus again. Remember that means

682
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.900
you better be leading yourself and following

683
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.200
Jesus hard yourself first so

684
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:28.900
you can help them.

685
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.800
But if we are to bring them up nourish

686
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.500
them spiritually that means we must

687
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.400
be teaching them the Bible teaching them

688
00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.800
the gospel teaching them about God at home.

689
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.400
We can't Outsource this to the church.

690
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.500
This this should be a place your home

691
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.400
should be the place that they come to ask gospel questions first.

692
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.300
That should be the culture of your home as grandparents as parents

693
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.600
that you feel. This is the place they're going to come first

694
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.300
to ask the Bible questions to ask the

695
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.000
Jesus questions. Not may not I can't wait

696
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.800
till Wednesday get to see Miss Kelly and I'm gonna ask her about that.

697
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.700
She should come to you Mom.

698
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.600
My dad she should come to you first to

699
00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.300
ask these questions because that's what the culture is

700
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.000
you've created.

701
00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.900
Now you might not know the answer, right?

702
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.100
Dad What's the Trinity like okay, you might have to get some help on

703
00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.700
that one. I have to get help on that one. So it's okay.

704
00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.400
But they should want to ask you because that's the

705
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.000
relationship they see first.

706
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:40.800
Praying over them.

707
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.500
It should be going to battle when

708
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.300
you look at the rest of Ephesians 6. There's all about spiritual warfare prayer.

709
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.400
You should be going to war for your kids and

710
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.100
your grandkids.

711
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.200
Praying over them praying apart from them that they hear

712
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.300
you pray for them directly face to face as they go

713
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.700
to bed as the eat food. Like you're you're praying over

714
00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.600
them that they know this is what we do. It's not just the

715
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.800
guy on the stage on Sunday prays like no dad prays

716
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800
all the time for me.

717
00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.400
Both I know it because he doesn't in front of me and he's

718
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:20.000
doing it behind the scenes. Mom is writing scripture down praying. Like

719
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.200
that's one thing my wife did.

720
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.500
When we first had our first son she got a

721
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.200
Bible and we did this together, of course, but she does it

722
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:28.900
way better than I do.

723
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.300
She

724
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.500
nearly daily will read through that Bible

725
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.200
wherever she's reading goes into that Bible and prays

726
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.400
that scripture for the the boy. We put

727
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.200
his name on the front of it.

728
00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.000
And she'll pray that and write the date and maybe a word

729
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.900
or two of encouragement or something that she prayed for him and go

730
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.100
through all three of them now, but we just have

731
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.600
done it now with Noah for 13 and a half years.

732
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.300
We've done it for Luke 11 and a half years. We've

733
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.400
done it for Levi for nine years and they will get that Bible.

734
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.800
At some point, we're not sure when 16 maybe 18

735
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.300
at some point. They will get that Bible and

736
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.700
it is just filled.

737
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.200
with Mom praying for them

738
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.200
and what that word is I've done it a little bit too. It's harder for

739
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.200
me to get into that and do it. That's just what she's decided to

740
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.200
do and yet it's got all of that in

741
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:23.400
there.

742
00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.400
Because she's going to war for my kids for our kids.

743
00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.400
So that is part of it as well. If we

744
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.500
are to bring them up.

745
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.500
In the discipline instruction of the Lord. This should

746
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.000
be a part of it.

747
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.900
But also don't you think about this? So we

748
00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.100
We said the word nourish is the same here. Bring them up.

749
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.000
We're considering these rhythms of parenting grandparenting like

750
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.900
kind of what we should focus on how we do this.

751
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:53.700
think about

752
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.900
how much effort?

753
00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.300
We spend on goals.

754
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.600
education

755
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:04.900
talents

756
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.600
for our own kids

757
00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.900
taking all the sports and practices and all the things.

758
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.200
Grandparents you're like celebrating things and going to

759
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.200
games and you're you're walking through that with them and

760
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.200
you're taking this one to proactive because mom's got to take this one. Like you're

761
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.100
you're helping out and and we're putting so much effort and

762
00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.900
energy into that.

763
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.200
Those goals that education tools Sports all of that.

764
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.200
But here's a question.

765
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.100
What if that child gets to the age of 20?

766
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.300
They're very successful.

767
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.200
honors student in high school

768
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.800
All district they're in a good college.

769
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.800
Right there physically attractive they're talented. They're

770
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.400
they've got everything that Edmund would

771
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.300
want to produce right?

772
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.000
But you failed to lead them to Christ.

773
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.600
Like what's that worth in the end?

774
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.000
That's a piercing question.

775
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.500
Like think about this is a

776
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.100
a solid B- student.

777
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.100
Who doesn't have any sports ability in them?

778
00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.200
But loves Jesus passionately.

779
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.700
Is that enough for you?

780
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:39.300
Is that enough?

781
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.100
Would that be a successful parenting Journey?

782
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.300
And you know all these other families all these other kids are doing all this big stuff and

783
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.000
their National Honors all that stuff. You know, that's who they

784
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.100
are.

785
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.600
But your kid is kind of the average middle the

786
00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.300
ground whatever but they love Jesus and they're willing

787
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.600
to go wherever he calls them.

788
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.100
Is that enough?

789
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.400
Because there's an inherent pressure.

790
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.900
from all sources towards that other side

791
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.300
is this enough?

792
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.200
Really? Shouldn't that be gold number one?

793
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.200
Should not be the most important thing we want for them. I

794
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.800
don't care if you make it to college.

795
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.900
I don't care if you have a successful Sports career.

796
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.500
I care that you're gonna stand before God someday and

797
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.900
he's gonna look at you and say Well done good and faithful, sir.

798
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.500
And in my kids' lives that is priority number

799
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:38.800
one.

800
00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.200
And that is my primary responsibility is to

801
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.500
do everything. I can to set them up to know

802
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.500
and follow Jesus. I can't guarantee that.

803
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.400
There's no formula to this. There's no way you

804
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.600
can guarantee your kid ends up that way. It's no.

805
00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.100
Ability on your part to do that which is

806
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.100
why we better pray, so I better trust the Lord.

807
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.800
But I better set the table.

808
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.500
I better make it as easy and as

809
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.200
likely as possible for them to follow him.

810
00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.100
That they see it in me. They know it's true that

811
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:21.200
I believe it that I'm living like it that I'm repenting when I fail that Jesus

812
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.700
really is who I am following the gospel

813
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.300
is my source and they know that this is what's

814
00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.300
priority for our family. We're not going to miss church on

815
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.400
Sundays for that. We're not going to do this. We're gonna make it we're

816
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.200
gonna sacrifice and give like they know that's what we do.

817
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.200
and then if it's

818
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.500
it's up to them.

819
00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.800
Then it's up to them to follow Jesus or not.

820
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.200
Between him and them that's what we want to.

821
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.300
Keep perspective here.

822
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.200
It's not wrong to pursue Sports not wrong

823
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.400
to pursue good grades. Don't hear me say that it's just we

824
00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.200
better keep that in perspective. What is

825
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.000
most important in their life?

826
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.200
It's maybe not what everybody else says is important.

827
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.800
Jesus following him. That's it.

828
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.600
and along with that as we nourish them bring them up in our

829
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.300
lives his grandparents even

830
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.400
We better make sure that they can own their faith before

831
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.200
they leave the house.

832
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.400
As much as we can help them that they like you

833
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.100
think about it you hope that when they graduate high

834
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.100
school go to college, that's what they do or they move off and

835
00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:40.000
get a job or something like you. Hope they can feed themselves you hope they can drive you.

836
00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.500
Hope they know how to pave bills right? You you

837
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.300
hope that's what they know how to do you better even more.

838
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.400
So hope they can do this Faith thing themselves.

839
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:51.900
that's why we

840
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.500
We've worked hard here at the church to try to make it where nobody

841
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.400
feels like.

842
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.500
they're they have to choose between church or

843
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.400
youth or church or kids like we

844
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.300
want this to be when this

845
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.200
child born here grows up through 18 and they graduate and leave

846
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.300
and they go somewhere else to a different church because they've moved to school or

847
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.900
moved to a job or whatever that they know what church actually

848
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.200
looks like and functions like that. They've been

849
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.300
a part of the church.

850
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.500
Not just part of the youth ministry or part of the kids' Ministry.

851
00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.200
They know what the church is like.

852
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.800
And they know what would like to function as an adult.

853
00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.100
In their faith before they go that's the goal

854
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:36.500
we have.

855
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.400
primarily yours as parents and ours as parents, but the

856
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.600
church comes alongside that

857
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.500
just like we hope to nourish them into those other things. We hope to nourish them

858
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.700
into their own faith Journey that they can own it and

859
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.000
live it.

860
00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.100
Because notice what Ephesians 6:4 says we bring them

861
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:55.600
up in.

862
00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.200
the discipline and instruction of the Lord

863
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.900
In other words, this is a gospel Focus.

864
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.200
Not just discipline instruction where they

865
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.400
learn a lot of things. They're good citizens. They know how to handle themselves

866
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.100
that they are in the Lord discipline instruction

867
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.900
of the Lord.

868
00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:20.300
Which means we teach them who God is as we go Deuteronomy

869
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.500
success, but also systematically teach them.

870
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.200
Who he is, but again, I keep coming back to this.

871
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.100
The problem is that recent research has shown.

872
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.500
The vast majority of parents do not hold a biblical

873
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.000
worldview.

874
00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.200
Like not understanding legitimately.

875
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.200
Who God is how that works out in our

876
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:44.500
lives?

877
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:46.600
There's a legitimate.

878
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.600
Failure at some point somewhere throughout

879
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:54.600
history to train people how

880
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.700
to see the world through God's lenses.

881
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.400
What he says goes how he says we are to

882
00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.600
be and so when you think about even the challenge

883
00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.400
to pass on this to our

884
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.400
children, what are we passing on?

885
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.000
Again, we as parents must understand first

886
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.100
and foremost who God is and how

887
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.100
to how to follow him. We've got to be followers of

888
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:20.700
him first.

889
00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.600
That's what we then pass on the things of the Lord.

890
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.100
Not just how to be a good American citizen how to

891
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.300
be a follower of Christ. They need to learn that from us.

892
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.500
How to understand who God is and believe in

893
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.400
his word what he said and how to study his word.

894
00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.000
They've got to learn that somewhere.

895
00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.400
And you can't Outsource that.

896
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.600
It has to be first and foremost in your home.

897
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.400
Now he does say something here about discipline.

898
00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.100
I'm not going to get into all of that because the word here has to

899
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.400
do with training.

900
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:03.500
meaning

901
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.700
You don't just teach them what to do you teach them how to do it.

902
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.400
train someone

903
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.600
it's a long process a lifelong journey, but you walk alongside

904
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.400
them not to prod anger, but to

905
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.000
show them how to follow Jesus themselves.

906
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.400
Not just lecturing them about how to follow Jesus but actually

907
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.500
showing them how to follow Jesus walking together again.

908
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.800
You better know how to do that first.

909
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.500
And if you need some help for that come back next week Phil will

910
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.300
tell you how to do it right get in a d group get into micro

911
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.000
group. You'll have the help you need and I'm not

912
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.300
joking about that. I'm serious if if you don't know.

913
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.300
how to follow Jesus you can't teach your kids how to follow

914
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:46.500
Jesus

915
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.300
so get help.

916
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.300
get around a couple guys get around a couple women and just

917
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:53.500
say

918
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.100
I don't know how to do this.

919
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.900
and you won't get this from people like

920
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:02.900
and

921
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.500
somebody should have taught you before now. You're too

922
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:06.500
late.

923
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.800
No, what you'll get is somebody saying, okay, let's

924
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:12.400
do this. Come on.

925
00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.100
Let me show you let me teach you. Let me walk with you and a crash

926
00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.400
course through some things. Let me help you quickly get up to speed

927
00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.500
and then let me walk with you encouragement not discouragement.

928
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.100
So that you can help train your kids.

929
00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.300
Teach them train them instruct them.

930
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.800
Now there is corrective training at times right? Don't do

931
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.000
this do that. Yes.

932
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.000
They should come in anguish come not in Anger should

933
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:40.600
anguish.

934
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.300
We're talking about don't provoke your children to anger. You better not be angry at them

935
00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.400
as you discipline them. It just gets it worse. It

936
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.700
amps it all up, right.

937
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.800
So discipline, yes.

938
00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:52.700
does matter

939
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.000
But it should be an anguish over the Rebellion against God.

940
00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.600
Not their failure to meet your

941
00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.100
standard.

942
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.400
But here's what I want to do before we get to some Q&amp;A real quick.

943
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.200
When I I'm writing this stuff down.

944
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.400
To communicate it as you're hearing these things and it is

945
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.600
always no matter when or what stage

946
00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.600
you're in it is always a daunting responsibility.

947
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.300
I mean it's over the top really there's so much

948
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.300
weight that can be lumped on our shoulders in this

949
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.000
like oh I fail like when you get older and your kids start to get

950
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.300
out, I'm sure this happens even more because it happens in my age as

951
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.600
I've got 13 11 9.

952
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.100
Like the further you go in this the regrets get like

953
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:39.800
larger.

954
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.200
About what you failed at or what? You

955
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.700
didn't do. Well he just

956
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.900
That's not the point of this. It's not what we're trying to do. We're not

957
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.900
trying to lump on more shame.

958
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.900
what we're trying to show is that

959
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.200
what we're saying in this is not about your competency.

960
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:01.700
to do it

961
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.300
It is your responsibility as a parent as a grandparent

962
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.300
these roles. We've been given. Yes, it's your responsibility, but it's

963
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.400
not about your competency because you

964
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.100
are weak.

965
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.300
I'm weak.

966
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.200
I cannot do this.

967
00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:22.700
But that's okay.

968
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.400
Because what that does.

969
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.500
Is it drives you to Jesus?

970
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.000
It drives you to Jesus when you see there's something insurmountable in

971
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.900
your life. It just forces you to Jesus.

972
00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.500
It's a heavy weight. Yes.

973
00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.600
But it's a great privilege.

974
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.500
That he is entrusted to you.

975
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.500
To have a direct influence in a disciple making

976
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.100
kind of way with someone who lives in your house all the time.

977
00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:55.800
What a gift.

978
00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.200
As a grandparent that God is entrusted to you. These precious little ones you

979
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.400
can actually give away at night and not take home, but you can like have

980
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.500
the influence you have on these children.

981
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.300
What a privilege that is.

982
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.500
It's overwhelming to think of how we could ever do that. But

983
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.400
to have a ready-made disciple making opportunity right inside your

984
00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.800
own home or in your family.

985
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.400
What a great opportunity.

986
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.600
So the weight is great. Yes, but don't let that overwhelm instead.

987
00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.400
Let that drive you to Jesus.

988
00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.100
Okay. So what kind of questions do you have? We've got.

989
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.100
15 plus minutes here

990
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.200
to just dig through some things that either I didn't

991
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:46.700
cover or

992
00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.200
More application based questions and then if

993
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.300
I can't answer it, I'll ask somebody else to answer it in the room who's a lot

994
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.400
more wise than I am.

995
00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.300
What do you have? What are some thoughts questions you had to come up along the

996
00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.000
way about the video about the chart. It's gonna see any of those again a

997
00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.800
video you can find online but the chart

998
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.200
or something like that love to

999
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:08.100
have some dialogue about this.

1000
00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:21.300
Yeah.

1001
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.500
Some Godly ways that I've influenced my children.

1002
00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.400
Yeah, so some good practices on like how to really build

1003
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.500
this into habits and rhythms in the house. Okay.

1004
00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.100
So when we were we had little ones at home.

1005
00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.600
We built a rhythm every single night.

1006
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:51.900
That we would read.

1007
00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:57.700
Ended up being Jesus storybook Bible, which is a great resource how it

1008
00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:01.100
just kind of goes through stories of the Bible and points to Jesus before that.

1009
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.200
There's a couple other ones that are more simple even than

1010
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.200
that big picture storybook Bible.

1011
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.900
A couple other ones have come out now but every night.

1012
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.500
From birth we'd read with our kids.

1013
00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:16.200
And just have the Bible there right before

1014
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.800
I would do it bath time read time bedtime. Like

1015
00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.400
that's how we did it.

1016
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.200
and our boys have

1017
00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.400
taken that ownership themselves now where they read before

1018
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.900
they go to bed. It's not even us doing it all the time.

1019
00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.500
But that was something we started babies all

1020
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.000
the way through and they they would jump up in the

1021
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.100
chair all that stuff. So that was just a way

1022
00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.900
to embed. I love for reading first of all, but then

1023
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.700
a love for Jesus.

1024
00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.200
Through his word as much as we could for a simple.

1025
00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:48.500
simple ways

1026
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.500
we have never really read Through the Bible with them

1027
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.400
like that. It was more like the story books

1028
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.200
Bible early on now the reading the Bible themselves, but we just

1029
00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.700
want to build that into our lives.

1030
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.500
We try to eat meals as many times as possible

1031
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.000
together.

1032
00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.400
And that means we're eating at 4:30 some nights most

1033
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.100
nights of the week because of practices that

1034
00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:14.400
night but we're trying to make that apart. We have like a highs lows

1035
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.300
conversation at the dinner table and we apply the gospel to

1036
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.000
some of those situations that we see. Sometimes it's just

1037
00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:23.400
Yeah, we had a tough day and we're grieving or

1038
00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.600
lamenting together. We had a great day and celebrating. It's not

1039
00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.300
a heavy gospel sermon conversation

1040
00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:32.400
every time sometimes it just fun and

1041
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.300
sometimes it's not fun to eat together, but it's

1042
00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:38.300
a rhythm we tried to build and that's just family time

1043
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.700
connection the engagement the emotional stuff.

1044
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.600
We've tried.

1045
00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:46.000
I get a little bit.

1046
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.400
Don't take this wrong. I get a little bit weirded out when people say

1047
00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.300
you have to do Family Worship like this every time

1048
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.200
every night.

1049
00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.300
I can get there. Of course.

1050
00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.800
That's your family great. It's not us.

1051
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.300
We just never have been able to we don't sing

1052
00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:06.900
together, right? That's that's just who we are.

1053
00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.800
Our boys don't really like it. So we just don't do it.

1054
00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:13.000
We listen to music all the time in the car. So we're

1055
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.900
kind of got that going gospel songs.

1056
00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.500
But to say has to work this certain way every

1057
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.500
time I don't think that's that's right

1058
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:26.900
because you look at Deuteronomy six and there's there's Court

1059
00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.100
of this as you go idea.

1060
00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.200
We just constantly are asking them questions in the

1061
00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:32.400
car.

1062
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.300
See something like hey, how's that point to God's glory? Just something

1063
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.200
like that and get some to think for a second or what's

1064
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.100
something you're struggling with and we'll talk about

1065
00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.400
a verse that goes with that.

1066
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:47.800
But the family worship time for us has just never been a really solid rhythm.

1067
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.200
It never worked but for us it's like

1068
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.900
all of life. Is this way Deuteronomy six?

1069
00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:57.300
So there's other things and I'd love to hear anything else that

1070
00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:00.300
you guys have tried other things that have worked or

1071
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.200
not worked anything that you would share that's been good.

1072
00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.800
habits rhythms of life to be spiritual influencers

1073
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.200
in your kids

1074
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:15.700
Yeah.

1075
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:08.700
Yeah.

1076
00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.100
Yeah, the question is about social media.

1077
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.200
and

1078
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.700
what can be our role in limiting that because of its effects

1079
00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:22.400
and I think you can go to every study even Facebook itself meta

1080
00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.000
now, whatever they call.

1081
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:27.100
has studies that show and they were kind of leaked out a couple

1082
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.100
months ago about how Instagram

1083
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:30.900
has

1084
00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:32.900
been proven to

1085
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.900
to show in teenage girls and younger, especially

1086
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.400
a much higher risk towards

1087
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.600
self-harm and

1088
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.700
It all stems from this comparison game. Like

1089
00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.700
they're self-image is so much lower like Studies

1090
00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:53.800
have proven this.

1091
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.600
Because they're on Instagram. Like that's the only thing.

1092
00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.600
Just because they're looking at these fake pictures and how people

1093
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.300
are posing everything. It's all a created

1094
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.000
image and they're like, I don't compare to that.

1095
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.300
And so you get this cycle, right? You get the negative feelings. They

1096
00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:12.800
haven't they don't have an emotional need met from a parent a

1097
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.300
dad. So they're gonna find it somewhere else and that's

1098
00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.700
a dangerous place to be

1099
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:18.400
so for us

1100
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.200
I don't think there's a hard and fast rule but for us.

1101
00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.600
We're considering not even let him be on social media at all till they're

1102
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:26.900
out of high school.

1103
00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.100
For sure already our oldest got a phone

1104
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:35.100
beginning at seventh grade merely because after school

1105
00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.100
practice, where are you going to be? We got to meet

1106
00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:40.400
you. When do you when you're done those kind of things but it's one of those phones it's

1107
00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.500
it's a pinwheel pinwheel. If

1108
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:46.500
you've heard of those that kind of are restricted phones

1109
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.300
you can do this with an iPhone as well. I think.

1110
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.800
But it is geared towards

1111
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.100
making it a super dumb phone.

1112
00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.000
Where you can't get apps that I don't put on the

1113
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.100
air on the phone for you and they're not even all those

1114
00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.400
social media apps at all. It's just chess or weather or

1115
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.600
whatever every text that

1116
00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.300
comes in. That's not a number. We've already checked and

1117
00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:14.500
approved is sent to a folder that I get to look at before it

1118
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.700
goes to his phone and then I can approve it or deny it.

1119
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:20.400
So nobody can just text him randomly. No pictures can come

1120
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.200
through like you just get a random, you know, you get

1121
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:27.500
those spam text messages that are just right that

1122
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.600
can't come. So we've just chosen to

1123
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.000
make it really restrictive. But then you can release it over

1124
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.300
time. You can let them have more freedom with

1125
00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:38.200
it as they get older as they earn

1126
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:42.000
that trust. I think that's one of the biggest things you just give them. I

1127
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.800
just I can't imagine having

1128
00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:48.300
Phone like I have now when I was in high

1129
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:48.300
school.

1130
00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:53.400
knowing the way I was how that

1131
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:55.400
is like a

1132
00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:56.800
poison

1133
00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:58.900
Right there in my pocket.

1134
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.400
And Imagining the access. So if

1135
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.300
you have any

1136
00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:08.000
if you have no acts no no restrictions on it. I

1137
00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:09.300
think that's unwise

1138
00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:13.900
I think they're God there has to be some some understanding

1139
00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.400
that they don't know how to process this stuff yet,

1140
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.000
and you have a measure of protection.

1141
00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:22.400
But you can help them. That's this not saying shelter them.

1142
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.700
This is saying help them understand how to handle it.

1143
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:29.400
And a firm who they are meet the emotional needs. They're

1144
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.500
not looking for it on social media or looking for it at school or wherever

1145
00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.000
else like you've got to find this way to have the connection.

1146
00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.200
To have the conversation about it.

1147
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.300
But I think it is going to prove to be much more dangerous than

1148
00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.100
we realize right now.

1149
00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.900
Again studies already showing this stuff. It's going to prove in

1150
00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.400
10 30 years how

1151
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.400
destructive this stuff really is to us.

1152
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.200
I would encourage you go watch social dilemma.

1153
00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:58.400
It's on Netflix. It's a documentary the social

1154
00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:58.900
dilemma.

1155
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.300
It's people who invented social media now regretting they

1156
01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.100
did it and talking about how it actually works and what

1157
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:09.100
they do to manipulate you psychologically and

1158
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:11.500
how it's like gamifying everything and it

1159
01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.200
just sucks you in and pulls you in and it's all that you are

1160
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:14.700
the product.

1161
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.200
You are a child is the product I said it

1162
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:25.000
kind of Sunday, right like commercials advertisements during Paw

1163
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.100
Patrol

1164
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.800
on TV is a way to

1165
01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.600
manipulate your child's psychologically so that

1166
01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.400
they get you to buy something for them.

1167
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.300
That's actually happening.

1168
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.200
And I'm not sky is falling crazy. Like, you know, I'm not gonna go

1169
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.100
live in the woods. Like that's not who I am because I'm involved in the

1170
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:43.500
world, too.

1171
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.400
But we've got to be aware. There's stuff like that going on.

1172
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.100
And be careful with those children that God's entrusted to

1173
01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:55.000
us to bring them up in the discipline instruction of Lord including how

1174
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.300
are you going to live in a world? That's just driven by

1175
01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.000
technology.

1176
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.100
Everything around us. It's not going away.

1177
01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.500
As much as we want to go back to dumb phones. It's not going to happen.

1178
01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.500
You train, how can you train your child how to deal with

1179
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.100
that how to navigate that how to handle it how to be wise according

1180
01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:15.500
to what God says about it. It's a dangerous

1181
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.700
thing that we've got to be careful about and there's a lot more Jason kushmal

1182
01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.800
is one of our deacons here.

1183
01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.200
He is a professional about social media

1184
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.100
and that whole thing. It's his job as a

1185
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.600
detective basically to research

1186
01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.700
that and dig into the back side of that the really

1187
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.400
bad side of that.

1188
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.000
He can help you. So if you want help on that we can have you.

1189
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.300
Sit on with him. He's got a seminar. Actually that's already been online

1190
01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.700
or been recorded we can give it to you but

1191
01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.500
How to navigate that with your kids so we've

1192
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.400
got the help here if you need that. If you want that, please just let

1193
01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.100
us know. It's great question. I think it's important for sure.

1194
01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.300
Anything else what else?

1195
01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:58.900
a couple minutes left

1196
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.100
I've got a couple comments too. If I always ask a question.

1197
01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:19.700
I got a couple more.

1198
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.400
Just random items I could say.

1199
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.100
Well, let me let me finish up with a couple things here and then I

1200
01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:31.000
want to pray together.

1201
01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.200
These are a couple just random comments. I had written down that

1202
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.600
didn't know if I'd get to or not.

1203
01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.100
make sure

1204
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.200
make sure that we as a church are supportive of those for bringing

1205
01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.400
kids into the worship Gathering.

1206
01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.600
So this is talking to all of us.

1207
01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:54.500
one of the things I think we're seeing in my generation in lower

1208
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:58.100
is a desire to to have

1209
01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:59.400
our children in there from

1210
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.200
Really early age and bring them up knowing church

1211
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.200
not just knowing kids ministry, which

1212
01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.400
is they're not against it. Nobody's against it. It's just we want

1213
01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.100
our kids to be in the church with all generations.

1214
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.700
And that's a challenge because they're kids and they're

1215
01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.300
distracting and they're not knowing how

1216
01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.000
to sit and sometimes they're coloring loudly or sometimes they got to get

1217
01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.300
up and go to the bathroom and all of those things happen.

1218
01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.800
But we as a church meaning you

1219
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.200
and me.

1220
01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.400
Must be okay with that and supportive

1221
01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.300
of that because we want

1222
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:37.400
those kids to love the church.

1223
01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.000
We want them to be able to know what it's like to be a part

1224
01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.600
of the church their whole lives. If they don't love the church. Now,

1225
01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.400
they've certainly won't love the church when they leave.

1226
01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.100
And so are they going to see from us?

1227
01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.400
Anger towards them distraction by them if we're

1228
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.100
distracted by that then maybe that says something more

1229
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.700
about us than about them because they're kids.

1230
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.400
Right, they they're not going to sit listen for 35

1231
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.400
minutes in a row and be completely on point because you're

1232
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.800
not even that way, right?

1233
01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.100
I mean, I know I I've said listen to sermons too. I know you don't

1234
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:11.600
catch everything.

1235
01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:15.500
I mean my mind wanders off for a few minutes like oh, yeah.

1236
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:18.600
We're point two. Okay, here we are.

1237
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.800
It's a training process.

1238
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.800
We should be mature enough to handle those Wiggles.

1239
01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.200
Right and support that and love that encourage that

1240
01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.100
I'd say it. Here's a Here's a thought. I said in my email

1241
01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.500
today go find a new person on Sunday that you don't know that you

1242
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.300
haven't seen before go meet them. Encourage them be a welcoming presence.

1243
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.700
If you see a family bringing in their little ones.

1244
01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.500
Go Champion that.

1245
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.500
Go say and I'm so thankful. You care

1246
01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.100
enough with your kids to bring them here and love the church. I love that.

1247
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.000
Do you need any help? Can I help you? Like, you know, can I sit with

1248
01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.500
your kids too and maybe if you need a break, let me tell you

1249
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.500
know, whatever but just encourage it. Let's celebrate

1250
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.600
that. I think it's huge.

1251
01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.300
last thing

1252
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.200
I'm not talking about this.

1253
01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:13.800
purely, but

1254
01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.500
One thing I know from my own experience and from

1255
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.600
everything. I've done as a minister children need

1256
01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.900
to see a Godly joy-filled marriage

1257
01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:24.700
first and foremost.

1258
01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:29.500
Again, I know their situations. I know it's not ideal for

1259
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:29.900
everyone.

1260
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.300
But they need to see that.

1261
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.300
So if you don't know my story my parents got divorced and I was a freshman in high

1262
01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:37.300
school.

1263
01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.500
So I understood everything it was happening.

1264
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.200
But I remember.

1265
01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:44.800
Sort of been like January.

1266
01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.600
Two three something like that.

1267
01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.100
I remember my mom.

1268
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.900
that night after

1269
01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.100
she asked him to leave because of the adultery.

1270
01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:01.700
ongoing

1271
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:06.000
but I tried to work it out that night.

1272
01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.200
Or that afternoon. She told me that dad's leaving

1273
01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:10.800
Dad's Gone.

1274
01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.900
My sister had already gone to college and so it's

1275
01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.200
just me and her but I remember.

1276
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.800
that night in my room just

1277
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.800
weeping balling

1278
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.500
because I knew everything was going to be different at that point.

1279
01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.500
And somehow I remember thinking this somehow

1280
01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.000
I thought it was my fault.

1281
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.900
It wasn't in any way.

1282
01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:44.200
But the emotional need had not been met faulty thinking.

1283
01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:46.100
all of those things

1284
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:47.600
right

1285
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.900
all that collapsed in that moment.

1286
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.000
It's my fault.

1287
01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.400
And I'm just ripped apart.

1288
01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.400
And so again, I know there's unique situations

1289
01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.500
and we'll walk with that. We'll walk as

1290
01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:07.600
best we can through that and fill the gaps that we can but marriage

1291
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.800
matters in parenting.

1292
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.400
The best thing you can do as parents is to

1293
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.100
have a healthy flourishing marriage.

1294
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.400
Where both of you are pursuing Jesus with

1295
01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.300
everything you are.

1296
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.500
Where both of you are competing to see how high you

1297
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.800
can get towards Jesus right? I mean just setting

1298
01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.200
the pace dads of course, but but both of

1299
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.100
you setting the pace toward Jesus, so your kids know

1300
01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.500
they are safe.

1301
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:44.100
We even tell our kids because we're we're around people.

1302
01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.500
They know my mom's story.

1303
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.200
Limited

1304
01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:52.100
But they know that's not my dad so they have to ask the

1305
01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:55.400
question like where's who's your dad? Well, he's Grandpa Dawn

1306
01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.600
that comes from Denver every once in a while like you but they

1307
01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:58.900
have like

1308
01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.400
how does that how does that work? So they've had to figure it out early in

1309
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.800
life friends get parents get divorced.

1310
01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.100
Every time that conversation comes up we look at them Square in the face and

1311
01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:14.200
we tell them directly out loud not. I'm not sugarcoat

1312
01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.400
in this.

1313
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.000
I say boys.

1314
01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.300
You don't have to worry about us.

1315
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.600
It's not an option for us.

1316
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.600
Just because they need to hear that.

1317
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.800
Right, they need to hear that truth again because they saw

1318
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.400
their parent the friend's parents.

1319
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.100
So their first thought might be a wonder if that's gonna happen

1320
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.500
to us and I tell them immediately. No.

1321
01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:39.800
It's not an option for us.

1322
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.200
We're gonna work through whatever it is. We're not doing anything stupid to get

1323
01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.300
us there. But we're also not going to allow it to break us that

1324
01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.900
we're going to work through everything.

1325
01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:49.900
You don't have to worry about that.

1326
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:51.800
so

1327
01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.400
That's the best thing you can have for your

1328
01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.300
and again, if it's history that that's been a broken thing before

1329
01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.800
now, it's this way. Okay Own It repent walk

1330
01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.300
in Holiness now and say this is who

1331
01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:08.100
we're gonna be. Well, I failed five years ago. Now we're

1332
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.400
gonna be this way because I know how much it

1333
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.100
hurts you it hurts them. This is who we're

1334
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:16.500
gonna be now, you can trust it and show them show them

1335
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.200
show them every day the rest of your life. That's what

1336
01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.600
it is affection love unity. That's the

1337
01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.500
best thing they need.

1338
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.300
It meets that need that they have they don't even know they have

1339
01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.800
they don't even know how to express it, but it meets it.

1340
01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.000
So let that be first.

1341
01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.300
if that's not possible, then let's

1342
01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:40.500
let's be examples of what it means to follow Jesus in the current situation. We're

1343
01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:40.600
in.

1344
01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.400
Right, everybody needs to see that because not every situation is

1345
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.100
a perfect Ideal Husband wife a couple kids. Like

1346
01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.200
that's not just reality for everybody. So this family over here

1347
01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.300
this this they need to see somebody over here following Jesus like that.

1348
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.100
So they can learn how to do that because they can't can't do it

1349
01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.300
like this anymore because whatever but but they can

1350
01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.200
see that and that's a great example for them of how to follow Jesus

1351
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.200
in their situation. It's the body of Christ right coming together.

1352
01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:11.500
So let's be passionately following Jesus first and

1353
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:15.100
foremost ourselves as couples as families, and

1354
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:17.200
we'll see God work in us

1355
01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.200
and through us as we pray. Let's pray

1356
01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.300
now as we pray for our kids God. Thank you

1357
01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.300
so much for tonight.

1358
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.400
Thank you for your blessings.

1359
01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.300
First of salvation of mercy and Grace that we don't deserve and we're

1360
01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.100
grateful for that. We pray now as

1361
01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.600
As parents grandparents Guardians influencers,

1362
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.400
whatever Lord we pray that as we see this

1363
01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.300
responsibility even more intensely now.

1364
01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.400
You would bless our efforts towards that that you

1365
01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.800
would Empower our efforts towards that that we see good fruit come

1366
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.100
from just a diligent effort towards.

1367
01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:00.100
Bringing our children up in the discipline instruction of the

1368
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:00.300
Lord.

1369
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:02.700
God keep us

1370
01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.900
from provoking them

1371
01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.200
When we do exasperate our children, God lead us

1372
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.100
to repentance quickly.

1373
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.800
before you first and then before our kids

1374
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.200
to repent to our kids when we blow it God may

1375
01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.600
that be normal.

1376
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.000
So that they learn how to repent too.

1377
01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:28.700
Show us Lord how to lead these gifts.

1378
01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.100
You've entrusted to us how to lead them towards you.

1379
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.600
We know we cannot change their hearts. We can't be the Catalyst towards

1380
01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.400
salvation for them. We can be an Avenue you

1381
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.300
use a tool you use to bring them to you, but we can't change

1382
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.100
their hearts God.

1383
01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.300
That's why we need you to do it.

1384
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.000
We pray that you would lead us to be.

1385
01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.500
Faithful followers of you with all that we are your priority

1386
01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.200
number one and that that would be who our kids are as well.

1387
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.500
And they would change the world.

1388
01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.600
They would follow you. They would not fall into the traps and

1389
01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.600
hiccups and pitfalls that we've fallen

1390
01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.400
into in our lives, but they would learn and follow you

1391
01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.000
with all that they are their whole lives.

1392
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.200
Help us. Holy spirit Empower us we can't

1393
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.600
do this ourselves. So we lean on you we need

1394
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:24.900
you.

1395
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.100
We're desperately dependent on you to do what only you can do

1396
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:29.400
God.

1397
01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.600
So Empower this tonight as we go that even tonight

1398
01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.600
with kids with grandkids with our spouses

1399
01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.200
with our friends even tonight. We'd be

1400
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:40.500
different.

1401
01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.900
For Your Glory in Jesus name amen

1402
01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.100
Amen, thanks everybody.

1403
01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:48.900
You are sent.
