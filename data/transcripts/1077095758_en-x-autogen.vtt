1
00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:03.565
Wow, what a powerful morning already hasn't it?

2
00:00:03.785 --> 00:00:05.405
Uh, don't worry.

3
00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.885
We'll get to thing some more a little bit later,

4
00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:08.925
so we'll get there, uh, in a few minutes.

5
00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:10.525
But if you're new to our church, we're

6
00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:11.565
so thankful you'd be here.

7
00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:14.045
Welcome. Uh, we know it's a big deal

8
00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:15.725
and so we're always blessed when you

9
00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:19.405
and others like you would be here just to show up.

10
00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:20.565
We would love to meet you.

11
00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:24.165
If you haven't already filled out the QR code in front

12
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:26.165
of you or the new here area in the lobby,

13
00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:27.485
please just introduce yourself.

14
00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:28.885
We'd love to tell you a little bit about who we are,

15
00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:31.725
help you connect to Jesus and to us.

16
00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:35.525
Now, while we do hope today is a unique encouragement

17
00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:37.485
as many of you're dressed up a little

18
00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:38.925
uniquely and things like that.

19
00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.445
It's not a special day, but,

20
00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:44.965
but the reality is it's not really any different than any

21
00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:47.485
other Sunday, and that's on purpose

22
00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:52.485
because our faith is in Christ alone every single day,

23
00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:57.125
not just on an emotional high Sunday like an Easter would be

24
00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:01.125
because our hope is in who he is

25
00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:02.605
and what he's done for us,

26
00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:08.605
and that in his death to life experience, he has the power

27
00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:12.245
to bring us from death to life as well.

28
00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:15.525
Now, here's the reality though.

29
00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:17.925
I acknowledge that some of you in this room don't believe

30
00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:20.465
that and you're just here

31
00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:21.585
because your family dragged you here

32
00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:23.225
so they can get a good picture for the gram, right?

33
00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:24.305
Like that's what they want to do,

34
00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:26.025
and you're just here, okay?

35
00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:27.705
I get it. I'm glad you're here.

36
00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.415
And you may not believe

37
00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:32.375
because you just can't conceive the fact

38
00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.575
that someone could actually come back to life that just,

39
00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:36.695
it's impossible to you.

40
00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:40.535
I would encourage you just to be curious about that

41
00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:41.695
and, and do some research.

42
00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:43.975
Look into it and see just what God would do

43
00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:47.755
to teach you something there or,

44
00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:50.155
or maybe, maybe you don't believe

45
00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:52.795
because there's, you just feel like there's no way

46
00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:54.915
God could save you.

47
00:01:56.615 --> 00:02:00.205
You've gone too far, you've done too much and,

48
00:02:00.205 --> 00:02:03.285
and you feel like it's, it's a, a no hope situation for you

49
00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:05.165
and that's why you don't believe.

50
00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:06.445
Listen, I've been there before.

51
00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:08.525
I've thought that in my own life at some point,

52
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:12.475
so that's maybe some of you.

53
00:02:12.475 --> 00:02:14.035
But I also know there's another group here today.

54
00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:17.795
This may be you that you do believe,

55
00:02:19.395 --> 00:02:22.375
but you just get regularly sucked into that vortex

56
00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:27.675
of temptation And you just feel like this cycle

57
00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:30.075
of sin that you're living in just makes you frustrated.

58
00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:34.475
Your life is unsatisfying because of that and you,

59
00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:37.715
and you're quietly concerned about your actual relationship

60
00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:40.075
with God that you, you've kind of been feeling

61
00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:42.715
that maybe his love is conditional and you've gone too far.

62
00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:47.525
And listen, the enemy

63
00:02:47.785 --> 00:02:51.325
of our souls would love nothing more than to keep you in

64
00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:55.835
that place, to keep you in that state,

65
00:02:55.855 --> 00:02:58.795
and that's all you feel and you are trapped.

66
00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:05.665
That's why today again, we're gonna focus on

67
00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:09.885
what Christ has done, believing

68
00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:13.045
that his resurrection power can bring you

69
00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:15.725
and me from death to life as well.

70
00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:19.585
So let's just start by praying for a moment.

71
00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:23.585
I want you to just, to quiet your heart in preparation

72
00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:26.745
for God's word, what he wants to say to you and to me today.

73
00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:31.575
Maybe you don't believe, maybe this is a struggle for you

74
00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:34.215
and just, just be honest with God,

75
00:03:34.245 --> 00:03:35.815
just a maybe you've never prayed before.

76
00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:37.135
And just a, a simple cry.

77
00:03:37.155 --> 00:03:38.695
God, speak to me today

78
00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:45.155
and see what he does for all of us.

79
00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:49.545
Ask God to root these truths deep in our hearts.

80
00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:57.945
Lord, we do pray that as your word is opened

81
00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:00.985
and studied today, that we would respond

82
00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:03.545
and hear what you want us to hear.

83
00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:07.645
Speak to us through

84
00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:10.325
what you've already said here in Jesus' name.

85
00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:15.205
Amen. Now we're gonna end up in Romans

86
00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:16.565
chapter six today.

87
00:04:16.585 --> 00:04:19.165
So you can go ahead and take your copy of God's Word, turn

88
00:04:19.165 --> 00:04:21.925
with me there on your device maybe as well

89
00:04:21.985 --> 00:04:23.565
or underneath the seat in front of you.

90
00:04:23.565 --> 00:04:26.565
There could be one Bible if you brought forgot yours,

91
00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:29.965
that's fine, Roman six.

92
00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:33.045
But it, it's hard to just kind of parachute into the middle

93
00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:37.085
of a book without the context of everything around it.

94
00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:39.445
So I wanna just give you a quick overview of the book

95
00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:43.245
of Romans and really what we're gonna see throughout

96
00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:45.245
this quick overview,

97
00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:48.845
but then even into the passage we'll study is the truth

98
00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:52.845
of God, the truth of us, and the truth of salvation.

99
00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:55.645
The truth about God, the truth about us,

100
00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:56.925
the truth about salvation

101
00:04:56.925 --> 00:04:59.645
because the book of Romans is a rich,

102
00:05:00.075 --> 00:05:03.405
comprehensive explanation of the gospel.

103
00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:08.725
It teaches us everything we need to know about this gospel.

104
00:05:10.345 --> 00:05:13.525
And so here's how the apostle Paul who inspired by God

105
00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:16.205
to write this, here's how he started it.

106
00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:20.165
He began by spending a long time highlighting the nature

107
00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:22.205
of our sin.

108
00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:26.325
That our sin is not merely like missing the mark

109
00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:27.765
or just kind of falling it.

110
00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:32.285
It's actually at its root rebellion against God.

111
00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:35.275
And that sin then,

112
00:05:35.275 --> 00:05:37.875
because that's what it is, causes physical

113
00:05:38.295 --> 00:05:41.435
and spiritual death in every one of us.

114
00:05:42.735 --> 00:05:46.995
That's the roots, the nature of sin that we're all guilty

115
00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:50.475
of needing that righteousness that it takes

116
00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:51.595
to get to be with God.

117
00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:52.955
We're all guilty of needing it,

118
00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:55.395
but being unable to provide it ourselves.

119
00:05:57.175 --> 00:05:58.945
It's very clear in Romans,

120
00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:01.065
but he didn't stop there thankfully.

121
00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:04.345
He continued by saying, yes, we need that righteousness,

122
00:06:05.245 --> 00:06:06.665
but God himself

123
00:06:07.145 --> 00:06:11.595
provided that righteousness, not by our own works, not

124
00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:13.075
because we deserved it or earned it, it's

125
00:06:13.075 --> 00:06:17.915
because of his grace of Jesus living

126
00:06:18.475 --> 00:06:19.955
a perfect life in our place.

127
00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:23.445
We couldn't do it. We needed to. We couldn't.

128
00:06:23.455 --> 00:06:25.165
Jesus did it for us.

129
00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:28.565
And again, that's his grace, a gift.

130
00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:32.625
This is what Ephesians two says about that.

131
00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:36.385
By grace, you have been saved through faith.

132
00:06:37.175 --> 00:06:38.305
This is not your own doing.

133
00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:43.265
It is the gift of God, not a result of works

134
00:06:43.725 --> 00:06:45.225
so that no one may boast.

135
00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:49.385
He gives that gift of Jesus perfect life,

136
00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:50.545
death and resurrection for you.

137
00:06:50.545 --> 00:06:52.985
That's a grace to us.

138
00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:56.505
And listen, that's, he did that in spite of the fact

139
00:06:56.775 --> 00:06:59.105
that every single one of us falls short

140
00:06:59.445 --> 00:07:03.095
of God's perfect standard and we don't deserve it.

141
00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:05.535
Just like you don't deserve birthday gifts,

142
00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:07.375
but you get, you receive them, right?

143
00:07:07.675 --> 00:07:09.215
God gave a gift

144
00:07:11.835 --> 00:07:13.045
even though we don't deserve it.

145
00:07:13.145 --> 00:07:14.965
And in spite of the fact, listen,

146
00:07:15.665 --> 00:07:17.005
not only that, we don't deserve it.

147
00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:18.285
He gave it to us.

148
00:07:18.285 --> 00:07:20.405
Knowing that we continue to fall short

149
00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:23.085
of his perfect standard from that point forward,

150
00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:27.455
that's just abundant amazing grace.

151
00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:31.475
So again, maybe you walked in here feeling

152
00:07:31.475 --> 00:07:32.595
like you're too far gone.

153
00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:35.675
One of the main truths that Romans teaches us is this,

154
00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:39.075
you cannot outs sin God's grace.

155
00:07:42.085 --> 00:07:43.455
Like you can't outs send it.

156
00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:46.215
His grace abounds,

157
00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:49.135
his grace covers you can't outs sin His grace.

158
00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:52.135
You can't go too far, have gone too far in that

159
00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:56.775
because if it's not based on you to begin with,

160
00:07:58.275 --> 00:08:01.215
if it's a gift of God's grace to you,

161
00:08:01.485 --> 00:08:02.815
then you haven't gone too far.

162
00:08:04.175 --> 00:08:05.225
It's not based on you.

163
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.785
You haven't gone too far

164
00:08:06.785 --> 00:08:10.545
because one John one, nine says, if we confess our sins,

165
00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:14.865
he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins

166
00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:18.265
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,

167
00:08:19.945 --> 00:08:24.485
not some sins, not the ones that aren't too bad all sins,

168
00:08:24.865 --> 00:08:27.805
no qualification, confess, he forgives.

169
00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:35.735
And so that's the truth. You can't outs send God's grace.

170
00:08:35.795 --> 00:08:38.815
But here's then the question that could come up

171
00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:42.765
in light of that truth, what's

172
00:08:42.765 --> 00:08:44.045
the question that could arise?

173
00:08:45.505 --> 00:08:47.485
And we'll see it here in Romans chapter six.

174
00:08:48.275 --> 00:08:50.205
Look at verse one. Here's the

175
00:08:50.365 --> 00:08:54.205
question, what shall we say then?

176
00:08:55.265 --> 00:08:57.085
Are we to continue in sin

177
00:08:57.355 --> 00:09:00.945
that Grace May abound, right?

178
00:09:00.945 --> 00:09:02.705
You see the question that could result from

179
00:09:02.815 --> 00:09:04.505
that whole tree can't outs send grace.

180
00:09:04.685 --> 00:09:07.825
And so the the logic of it seems to think like this.

181
00:09:07.885 --> 00:09:11.755
So if if God's grace Is

182
00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:15.275
covering my sin and that that's good, right?

183
00:09:15.285 --> 00:09:19.115
Grace is good. So I'm sin grace covers sin.

184
00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:22.715
The more sin grace abounds over that if, if that's the truth

185
00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:25.915
and I want more grace, should I then sin

186
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.475
more to get more grace?

187
00:09:29.275 --> 00:09:33.855
Like that's the question, should I sin more?

188
00:09:34.805 --> 00:09:37.815
Because grace abounds where sin abounds.

189
00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:41.295
I I want more grace, so I should sin more right now.

190
00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:44.175
I know, I know. Kids are like, what are you saying?

191
00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:48.135
No, right? That it's a, it sounds really weird

192
00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:49.215
to our modern ears.

193
00:09:50.275 --> 00:09:52.215
We know the Sunday school answer to this.

194
00:09:55.075 --> 00:09:56.975
But listen, the enemy loves

195
00:09:57.355 --> 00:09:58.455
To take anything

196
00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:02.495
And twist it to trip you up.

197
00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:07.065
And so this seems illogical to us, but,

198
00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:09.985
but it actually is something people wrestle with.

199
00:10:11.165 --> 00:10:14.645
And So what's the answer to it?

200
00:10:15.405 --> 00:10:16.925
I think we all know, right? Should we

201
00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.325
send more to receive more grace?

202
00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:20.085
Well look at the first couple words of verse two.

203
00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:26.045
By no means that's all he says, by no means, right?

204
00:10:26.045 --> 00:10:29.005
That's the, in the original language, that is the strongest

205
00:10:29.685 --> 00:10:33.665
possible way to say no meaning,

206
00:10:34.465 --> 00:10:37.345
absolutely, positively, definitely not.

207
00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:39.625
Should you send more to get more grace.

208
00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:41.505
It just does not work that way.

209
00:10:41.505 --> 00:10:46.425
That's not how this thing works. You shouldn't,

210
00:10:47.495 --> 00:10:49.985
well, thankfully Paul gave us reasons

211
00:10:50.885 --> 00:10:51.885
Why.

212
00:10:52.615 --> 00:10:54.065
Okay, so that's not the right answer.

213
00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:57.145
We're not question right, not the right question to ask.

214
00:10:57.165 --> 00:10:58.785
So what do we do? Well,

215
00:10:58.785 --> 00:11:00.865
what is the reason why we shouldn't do that?

216
00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:05.855
I wanna read the whole passage now, Romans six, one

217
00:11:05.855 --> 00:11:08.635
through 11, and I want you

218
00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:12.955
to see if you can pick out the reasons that God gives us.

219
00:11:15.535 --> 00:11:16.585
What shall we say then?

220
00:11:16.605 --> 00:11:19.865
Are we to continuing sin that Grace May abound By no means,

221
00:11:21.405 --> 00:11:24.265
how can we who died to sin still live in it?

222
00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:27.015
Do you not know that all of us

223
00:11:27.035 --> 00:11:29.215
who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were

224
00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:30.655
baptized into his death?

225
00:11:32.315 --> 00:11:33.855
We were buried, therefore with him

226
00:11:33.875 --> 00:11:36.895
by baptism into death in order that just

227
00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:39.375
as Christ was raised from the dead, by the glory

228
00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:42.575
of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life

229
00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:46.255
for if we've been united with him in a death like his,

230
00:11:46.515 --> 00:11:47.895
we shall certainly be united

231
00:11:47.895 --> 00:11:49.935
with him in a resurrection like his.

232
00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:54.405
We know that our old self was crucified with him in order

233
00:11:54.405 --> 00:11:57.605
that the body of sin might be brought to nothing so

234
00:11:57.605 --> 00:11:59.885
that we would no longer be enslaved to sin

235
00:12:00.065 --> 00:12:02.525
for one who's died, has been set free from sin.

236
00:12:03.385 --> 00:12:04.525
Now, if we've died with Christ,

237
00:12:04.585 --> 00:12:06.405
we believe we'll also live with him.

238
00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.205
And we know that Christ being raised from the dead,

239
00:12:09.335 --> 00:12:10.445
we'll never die again.

240
00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:14.855
Death no longer has dominion over him for the death he died.

241
00:12:14.855 --> 00:12:16.975
He died to sin once for all.

242
00:12:17.795 --> 00:12:20.095
But the life he lives, he lives to God.

243
00:12:21.555 --> 00:12:25.295
So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin

244
00:12:25.475 --> 00:12:27.775
and alive to God in Christ Jesus.

245
00:12:29.935 --> 00:12:32.395
So you saw his logical argument, right?

246
00:12:33.175 --> 00:12:34.715
Here's the truth, here's what this means.

247
00:12:34.715 --> 00:12:36.515
Here's what this he, he walks through it

248
00:12:36.515 --> 00:12:40.835
and really it, it comes into two big buckets of how he said,

249
00:12:41.015 --> 00:12:44.195
here's the reason you shouldn't send more to get more grace.

250
00:12:44.295 --> 00:12:46.155
Let me show you. Here's the first reason.

251
00:12:47.425 --> 00:12:51.035
It's because Christ actually brought sin to nothing.

252
00:12:53.535 --> 00:12:57.875
The first reason is because Christ brought sin to nothing.

253
00:13:01.275 --> 00:13:02.495
That's what verse six says.

254
00:13:03.975 --> 00:13:07.195
We know our old self was crucified with him in order

255
00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:11.415
that the body of sin might be brought to nothing so

256
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.735
that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.

257
00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:18.015
And so this is what we just celebrated a couple days ago on

258
00:13:18.015 --> 00:13:22.335
Good Friday when Jesus died, when the perfect Christ

259
00:13:22.845 --> 00:13:27.375
died on that cross in our place, it was to destroy the power

260
00:13:27.475 --> 00:13:29.575
of sin and to

261
00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:32.815
free us from the power of sin.

262
00:13:33.755 --> 00:13:37.335
That's why his death was so good, why it matters.

263
00:13:37.405 --> 00:13:42.295
When he took the death that we deserved on that cross,

264
00:13:42.635 --> 00:13:44.375
he did it so that we wouldn't have

265
00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:46.535
to receive the punishment for our sin anymore.

266
00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:50.275
Death he took that away.

267
00:13:50.575 --> 00:13:53.915
And so he destroyed sin and its power,

268
00:13:54.215 --> 00:13:57.795
and he did that so that we would have the sins grip

269
00:13:58.475 --> 00:13:59.595
released from our lives.

270
00:14:00.775 --> 00:14:02.435
The chains would be broken.

271
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.085
See, here's the reality, whether you realize it

272
00:14:07.085 --> 00:14:11.785
or not, every single one of us, every human

273
00:14:12.355 --> 00:14:15.345
apart from God on our own, every one

274
00:14:15.345 --> 00:14:17.665
of us are enslaved to sin.

275
00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:23.985
We're born into it. We sin, we, we are enslaved to it

276
00:14:24.035 --> 00:14:26.025
until God does something different.

277
00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:29.405
I've heard people say, I've had conversations

278
00:14:29.405 --> 00:14:31.485
with people all over the world.

279
00:14:31.755 --> 00:14:34.485
I've heard people say about Christianity.

280
00:14:34.485 --> 00:14:36.205
They're like, ah, man, it's, it's oppressive.

281
00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:39.845
Like how do you guys, you guys, all those rules, like

282
00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:40.845
that's just so oppressive.

283
00:14:40.925 --> 00:14:43.085
I, I wanna live my life the way I wanna live it.

284
00:14:45.055 --> 00:14:47.315
I'm, I don't wanna be free. I don't shackled up by that.

285
00:14:47.315 --> 00:14:50.825
I wanna be free. Here's how I respond.

286
00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:55.625
You actually aren't free.

287
00:14:57.705 --> 00:14:59.155
Even if you think that you're in charge,

288
00:14:59.155 --> 00:15:01.435
you're running the show, you're on your own.

289
00:15:01.895 --> 00:15:05.955
You actually aren't free. You are a slave to sin.

290
00:15:07.605 --> 00:15:10.065
It is what controls you. It pulls the strength.

291
00:15:10.135 --> 00:15:12.265
It's telling you what to do and what not to do.

292
00:15:12.265 --> 00:15:15.545
You're not in control as much as you think you are.

293
00:15:16.845 --> 00:15:19.225
That's the reality for every one of us apart from Christ.

294
00:15:19.445 --> 00:15:22.225
Yet what Christ has done is

295
00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:24.945
what frees us from that slavery.

296
00:15:26.575 --> 00:15:30.705
Look at verse seven, for one who has died

297
00:15:31.445 --> 00:15:33.225
has been set free from sin,

298
00:15:35.395 --> 00:15:36.455
not a slave anymore.

299
00:15:36.885 --> 00:15:40.255
Free from it because Christ died.

300
00:15:40.555 --> 00:15:43.695
You have now been freed as well.

301
00:15:44.075 --> 00:15:48.305
But the only way you get that is by identifying

302
00:15:48.305 --> 00:15:49.625
with Christ in his death.

303
00:15:50.525 --> 00:15:53.555
You don't have to die anymore because he died for you.

304
00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:54.635
But you have to identify,

305
00:15:54.635 --> 00:15:57.075
that's the baptism language here that he talks about.

306
00:15:57.425 --> 00:16:00.155
That you've, by faith, you've not done the act,

307
00:16:00.155 --> 00:16:02.035
but you've thought by faith

308
00:16:02.065 --> 00:16:04.075
that Christ's death counts for yours.

309
00:16:04.135 --> 00:16:07.075
You've said, I'm in, all my eggs are in that basket.

310
00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:11.715
I am hopeless without him, his death counts for mine.

311
00:16:11.975 --> 00:16:16.315
And if he died, then by identification I say, I died too.

312
00:16:18.295 --> 00:16:21.695
I am in him. So I have died, which is

313
00:16:21.715 --> 00:16:25.055
how Paul can say in verse two, how can those who've died

314
00:16:25.195 --> 00:16:26.975
to sin still live in it?

315
00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:31.715
He died. You died to sin.

316
00:16:32.815 --> 00:16:34.115
How can you still live in it?

317
00:16:34.385 --> 00:16:36.595
It's a logical impossibility at that point

318
00:16:37.665 --> 00:16:41.835
because again, Christ's death means believers are free now.

319
00:16:45.575 --> 00:16:48.155
So Christ brought sin to nothing, but there's more.

320
00:16:50.785 --> 00:16:53.325
Christ also brought death to nothing.

321
00:16:58.465 --> 00:17:00.925
He brought death to its knees.

322
00:17:02.465 --> 00:17:04.085
That's really the central point of

323
00:17:04.085 --> 00:17:05.405
what we're celebrating today on

324
00:17:05.405 --> 00:17:06.565
this resurrection day, right?

325
00:17:07.945 --> 00:17:10.405
The fact that Christ came out of the grave, it's

326
00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:11.965
what verse nine says here, we know

327
00:17:11.965 --> 00:17:15.645
that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again.

328
00:17:16.175 --> 00:17:18.925
Death no longer has dominion over him.

329
00:17:19.265 --> 00:17:21.645
No longer says here's how this is gonna go,

330
00:17:21.825 --> 00:17:24.245
has has any sway over him.

331
00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:27.245
He is not under its authority,

332
00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:32.155
which again means then let's go back to identification

333
00:17:32.535 --> 00:17:34.915
for those who are in Christ.

334
00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:39.755
By faith, death no longer has dominion over us either.

335
00:17:41.535 --> 00:17:46.185
If he died and we identify with his death, if he raised,

336
00:17:46.325 --> 00:17:48.545
we identify with his resurrection.

337
00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:50.045
That's what verse five says.

338
00:17:50.265 --> 00:17:52.365
If we've been united with him in a death like his,

339
00:17:52.465 --> 00:17:53.565
we shall certainly be united

340
00:17:53.565 --> 00:17:55.205
with him in a resurrection like his.

341
00:17:55.585 --> 00:17:57.645
It counts for us.

342
00:17:59.555 --> 00:18:02.765
That means that death is not the final word for us either.

343
00:18:05.815 --> 00:18:09.315
We can walk as verse four said in newness of life.

344
00:18:09.615 --> 00:18:12.075
Now, just because he raised from the dead,

345
00:18:12.345 --> 00:18:14.195
it's counted for us.

346
00:18:16.185 --> 00:18:17.815
Verse eight, if we've died with Christ,

347
00:18:17.835 --> 00:18:19.495
we believe we'll also live with him.

348
00:18:19.805 --> 00:18:21.055
This is a guarantee

349
00:18:21.965 --> 00:18:23.895
that when Christ came outta the grave alive,

350
00:18:24.075 --> 00:18:25.815
that's a guarantee that we're gonna come outta the

351
00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:26.855
grave alive someday as well.

352
00:18:28.365 --> 00:18:30.555
Death used to be

353
00:18:30.695 --> 00:18:33.675
before 2000 years ago, an undefeated enemy

354
00:18:35.935 --> 00:18:37.445
death is no longer undefeated.

355
00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:41.685
Christ has defeated death forever.

356
00:18:46.385 --> 00:18:47.845
But then what does that mean for us today?

357
00:18:50.775 --> 00:18:52.675
So, so what does all this, like what are the results?

358
00:18:52.985 --> 00:18:55.875
Then let, let's make this personal.

359
00:18:57.175 --> 00:18:58.825
There's a lot of good theory and

360
00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:00.585
and we worship Christ for this,

361
00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.705
but what are the results in our day-to-day lives

362
00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:04.905
of what Jesus has done?

363
00:19:07.755 --> 00:19:09.205
Well, let me give you one here.

364
00:19:10.105 --> 00:19:12.115
If you are a believer,

365
00:19:15.495 --> 00:19:20.045
if you've believed in him, then

366
00:19:20.045 --> 00:19:22.685
because Jesus brought sin to nothing

367
00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:24.725
and he brought death to nothing.

368
00:19:24.985 --> 00:19:29.325
If you're a believer that now means you have a new identity,

369
00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:36.505
you are a new person, you have a new

370
00:19:37.585 --> 00:19:41.285
identity, watch this.

371
00:19:41.285 --> 00:19:44.085
Look again at the end of this section, verse 11, notice

372
00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.845
how he closed this section out.

373
00:19:50.225 --> 00:19:53.445
So as a result of all that, you also must

374
00:19:54.085 --> 00:19:57.165
consider yourselves dead to sin

375
00:19:57.465 --> 00:19:59.405
and alive to God in Christ

376
00:19:59.575 --> 00:20:04.575
Jesus Like this.

377
00:20:04.655 --> 00:20:08.015
This is what he's saying here, consider yourself that word.

378
00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:11.255
Consider means to calculate and then to believe.

379
00:20:11.405 --> 00:20:13.135
Like you go through a logical process

380
00:20:13.355 --> 00:20:14.735
of figuring something out.

381
00:20:14.915 --> 00:20:17.655
You've searched all the answers, you've come

382
00:20:17.655 --> 00:20:18.655
to this conclusion.

383
00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:20.855
That's the result, and you're holding onto that.

384
00:20:21.195 --> 00:20:23.615
That's that word. Consider

385
00:20:24.535 --> 00:20:27.525
yourself what?

386
00:20:29.435 --> 00:20:33.085
That because Christ died because Christ is alive to God.

387
00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.805
I can now consider myself dead to sin

388
00:20:37.145 --> 00:20:38.525
and alive to God in Christ.

389
00:20:40.575 --> 00:20:43.425
That is your new identity.

390
00:20:43.605 --> 00:20:48.445
Now, like you are under new ownership, used to be enslaved

391
00:20:48.465 --> 00:20:49.765
to sin, now you're free.

392
00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:50.925
That that sign on the side

393
00:20:50.925 --> 00:20:53.605
of the building has changed right under new ownership.

394
00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:56.605
That's you. Consider yourself that.

395
00:20:59.385 --> 00:21:02.795
Keep telling yourself that over and over.

396
00:21:02.865 --> 00:21:05.435
Keep pounding that into your brain, into your heart,

397
00:21:05.505 --> 00:21:06.715
that you're not defined.

398
00:21:07.145 --> 00:21:09.475
Hear this, you're not defined by that sin anymore.

399
00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.375
You're not defined by your past anymore.

400
00:21:15.305 --> 00:21:19.845
If this is true, you are defined by Christ

401
00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:22.765
and what he has done for you.

402
00:21:24.085 --> 00:21:26.415
It's his work in your place. It's not your work.

403
00:21:26.415 --> 00:21:28.575
And listen, when you understand that, when

404
00:21:28.575 --> 00:21:30.575
that gets deep into your soul

405
00:21:30.835 --> 00:21:33.175
and you stand on that solidly, man,

406
00:21:33.175 --> 00:21:35.015
that's a freeing place to be, isn't it?

407
00:21:37.445 --> 00:21:39.665
My identity is not in what people think about me

408
00:21:39.685 --> 00:21:41.465
or say about me or what I did in the past.

409
00:21:41.525 --> 00:21:44.025
My identity is now only in Christ alone.

410
00:21:44.245 --> 00:21:45.385
And what he says I am

411
00:21:45.385 --> 00:21:48.385
and who he says I am, like that's freeing.

412
00:21:49.485 --> 00:21:52.505
That's how you can live a life to God now instead

413
00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:54.345
of enslaved to your past.

414
00:21:59.715 --> 00:22:03.695
And so again, that's true for you, possible for you.

415
00:22:04.325 --> 00:22:07.375
Whether you've run hard away from God your whole life

416
00:22:09.915 --> 00:22:12.455
or whether you grew up in the church

417
00:22:12.475 --> 00:22:14.935
and your whole life has been this moral mask

418
00:22:15.795 --> 00:22:20.135
and you didn't believe, if

419
00:22:20.475 --> 00:22:24.575
Christ is who you're believing in, your

420
00:22:25.215 --> 00:22:27.765
identity is in him.

421
00:22:29.035 --> 00:22:30.685
This is your new identity.

422
00:22:32.495 --> 00:22:35.075
If you've entrusted your life to Christ, you're not.

423
00:22:36.335 --> 00:22:38.835
You're not. Anything the world says or your past says

424
00:22:38.835 --> 00:22:41.275
or the enemy says it, it is you are dead

425
00:22:41.495 --> 00:22:44.165
to sin like you.

426
00:22:44.165 --> 00:22:45.805
You don't have to have its authority anymore.

427
00:22:45.905 --> 00:22:48.125
You don't have to let it reign in your life anymore.

428
00:22:48.185 --> 00:22:49.365
That's you're dead to it.

429
00:22:50.145 --> 00:22:52.045
If you're dead to something, it has no power.

430
00:22:52.305 --> 00:22:54.445
You are dead to sin. That's true of you.

431
00:22:55.385 --> 00:22:57.885
And you are alive to God.

432
00:22:57.945 --> 00:23:01.195
Now, just think of the blessing that is

433
00:23:02.015 --> 00:23:03.035
the God of the universe.

434
00:23:03.095 --> 00:23:04.875
You have a living relationship with him.

435
00:23:05.095 --> 00:23:06.795
You are not enslaved to sin. You're alive.

436
00:23:06.795 --> 00:23:09.875
You can walk with him and live out a life for him.

437
00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:11.795
Like that is a privilege

438
00:23:13.585 --> 00:23:15.315
because of what Christ has done for you.

439
00:23:17.435 --> 00:23:22.225
Amazing grace. You have a new identity.

440
00:23:23.245 --> 00:23:24.825
And the more you rest in that identity,

441
00:23:24.845 --> 00:23:27.345
the more the second result will come about.

442
00:23:27.415 --> 00:23:29.585
It's that Christ not only gives you a new identity,

443
00:23:29.605 --> 00:23:34.165
he gives you a new life, a whole new life,

444
00:23:38.165 --> 00:23:40.655
dead to sin, alive to God.

445
00:23:41.395 --> 00:23:43.495
And like verse four said, just

446
00:23:43.495 --> 00:23:45.245
as Christ was raised from the dead, by the glory

447
00:23:45.245 --> 00:23:49.565
of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life

448
00:23:50.945 --> 00:23:52.245
and we might live a new life.

449
00:23:52.945 --> 00:23:54.565
If we're dead to sin alive to God,

450
00:23:54.565 --> 00:23:56.605
that's gonna look a little bit different.

451
00:23:56.605 --> 00:23:57.685
And that was the point of this section.

452
00:23:57.715 --> 00:24:00.485
It's describing what that new life looks like.

453
00:24:00.585 --> 00:24:03.285
So just rest in this that, that you don't have to

454
00:24:04.045 --> 00:24:06.765
continue living in sin anymore if you're dead to it.

455
00:24:08.285 --> 00:24:10.705
If you are dead to sin, it doesn't have any power.

456
00:24:10.925 --> 00:24:11.945
You are freed.

457
00:24:11.945 --> 00:24:14.705
You're not enslaved to it anymore, you're free.

458
00:24:17.045 --> 00:24:20.025
That's the new life that you can live out in Him.

459
00:24:20.205 --> 00:24:22.305
But there's also this, and we often miss this one.

460
00:24:25.245 --> 00:24:28.015
It's what gives you the power to live that new life.

461
00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:30.335
It's that you have the ability

462
00:24:31.555 --> 00:24:34.415
to live in Christ's resurrection power

463
00:24:34.965 --> 00:24:36.095
that you never had before.

464
00:24:38.155 --> 00:24:40.215
The new life comes

465
00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:44.885
because Christ, his life counts for yours.

466
00:24:44.945 --> 00:24:46.045
His death counts for yours,

467
00:24:46.045 --> 00:24:47.885
and his resurrection counts

468
00:24:48.505 --> 00:24:51.045
by giving you new life a new power.

469
00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:54.765
I don't think we ever conceive of that the the same power

470
00:24:56.245 --> 00:24:58.255
that raised Christ from the dead

471
00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:05.085
lives in you Christian man,

472
00:25:05.085 --> 00:25:06.685
that temptation is strong man, that

473
00:25:06.835 --> 00:25:08.925
that sin keeps coming back.

474
00:25:11.465 --> 00:25:15.665
Resurrection power lives in you, Christian, so

475
00:25:15.665 --> 00:25:18.585
that you can say no to temptation so

476
00:25:18.585 --> 00:25:21.425
that you can not go back to those chains

477
00:25:21.425 --> 00:25:22.785
and wrap yourself back up

478
00:25:22.785 --> 00:25:24.905
with your freed from you don't have to anymore.

479
00:25:25.165 --> 00:25:27.825
So you can say it gives you power to say yes,

480
00:25:27.885 --> 00:25:30.065
to loving others sacrificially that you couldn't

481
00:25:30.065 --> 00:25:34.265
before to say yes to worshiping God with your whole heart.

482
00:25:34.365 --> 00:25:37.625
The resurrection power empowers you to stop living

483
00:25:37.645 --> 00:25:39.025
for yourself and live for other people.

484
00:25:39.245 --> 00:25:42.825
That's what he does to give you a new life.

485
00:25:44.155 --> 00:25:45.655
But hear me, that's only possible.

486
00:25:46.325 --> 00:25:49.575
That kind of life only comes if you are resting in Christ's

487
00:25:49.575 --> 00:25:50.895
victory over sin

488
00:25:50.915 --> 00:25:55.775
and death for you, not by mustering up strength

489
00:25:55.775 --> 00:25:58.215
and going to do it better today than you did yesterday.

490
00:25:58.285 --> 00:26:00.055
It's that you've placed your faith in him

491
00:26:00.055 --> 00:26:01.135
and say, I got nothing.

492
00:26:01.425 --> 00:26:04.175
Jesus. I need you in every way.

493
00:26:04.275 --> 00:26:05.575
And so that's the call today.

494
00:26:07.795 --> 00:26:09.125
Turn to him today

495
00:26:11.525 --> 00:26:15.985
and listen this, this is what he wants to remind you of

496
00:26:16.055 --> 00:26:17.225
through this is

497
00:26:17.225 --> 00:26:19.905
that was based on nothing you could have ever done.

498
00:26:21.375 --> 00:26:23.755
And it's not hindered by anything you have done.

499
00:26:24.745 --> 00:26:25.915
It's because he loves you.

500
00:26:27.615 --> 00:26:30.275
He did all of this even though you're his enemy,

501
00:26:30.275 --> 00:26:32.155
because he loves you.

502
00:26:32.335 --> 00:26:34.675
And so run to him in that love.

503
00:26:36.205 --> 00:26:37.825
Run back to him if you need

504
00:26:37.825 --> 00:26:39.105
to run to him for the first time.

505
00:26:39.455 --> 00:26:42.305
Even if you feel distant,

506
00:26:44.165 --> 00:26:47.715
You feel dry, you feel dead today,

507
00:26:51.505 --> 00:26:55.085
Christ can bring dead parts of you back to life.

508
00:26:58.125 --> 00:27:01.845
So run home, run to this

509
00:27:02.635 --> 00:27:03.685
good Father.

510
00:27:06.215 --> 00:27:07.755
I'm gonna invite the worship leaders to come out now,

511
00:27:07.755 --> 00:27:09.995
and we're gonna continue in the spirit of God's word

512
00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:11.155
as we reflect today.

513
00:27:13.235 --> 00:27:16.375
And I just want you to bow your heads just to kind

514
00:27:16.375 --> 00:27:19.255
of focus a little bit, if you would,

515
00:27:21.635 --> 00:27:24.295
and just reflect and ask questions and think and pray

516
00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:28.975
and respond to the Lord as he would lead us right now.

517
00:27:33.845 --> 00:27:34.905
So again, maybe you're here

518
00:27:34.905 --> 00:27:37.025
and you're just like, well, I didn't, I didn't want to come.

519
00:27:39.965 --> 00:27:42.715
Maybe God, maybe God showed you something today.

520
00:27:45.615 --> 00:27:47.995
You don't know the answers, you don't have all the things

521
00:27:48.235 --> 00:27:53.155
figured out, but, but just in your heart, say,

522
00:27:53.155 --> 00:27:54.875
God, what do you, what do you want from what?

523
00:27:54.875 --> 00:27:57.075
What do you want for me? What do you want from me? How?

524
00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:59.275
How do I respond? And, and just ask Him.

525
00:28:00.495 --> 00:28:03.595
He promises to bless those who seek him.

526
00:28:05.895 --> 00:28:09.715
Or maybe you feel like, man, I'm so far from God right now.

527
00:28:09.735 --> 00:28:12.955
And, and just, man, I hit reset trying

528
00:28:12.955 --> 00:28:14.355
to come back today at Easter.

529
00:28:14.495 --> 00:28:19.475
And Jesus told a great parable about a,

530
00:28:19.555 --> 00:28:21.915
a son who'd run away for a long time and wasted his life.

531
00:28:22.055 --> 00:28:24.915
And the father was there

532
00:28:25.745 --> 00:28:27.275
celebrating his return.
