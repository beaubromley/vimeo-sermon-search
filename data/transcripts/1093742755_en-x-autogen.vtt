WEBVTT

1
00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:36.705
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:39.265
It's great to see you. Happy Father's Day.

3
00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:42.905
Uh, my prayer on a day like this is that, uh, a day

4
00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:47.865
of celebration would merely challenge all of us men to

5
00:00:48.735 --> 00:00:52.185
towards holiness, towards Christlikeness, uh, as we lead

6
00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:53.425
and serve others.

7
00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:56.545
This summer, it maybe you are aware,

8
00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:58.105
but if not this summer,

9
00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:01.065
we're spending our Sunday mornings in the book of Romans,

10
00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:04.025
specifically in chapter 12 as we look at

11
00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.225
how God realigns our lives back to

12
00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:11.185
the way Christ modeled a life that we should be living.

13
00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:14.345
Uh, as we get into it today, I want to tell you about one

14
00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:15.585
of my favorite movies of all time.

15
00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:17.665
It is the movie Inside Out.

16
00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.665
And uh, some of you are like, it's a kids movie.

17
00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:22.785
Yeah, I know you can laugh at me all you want, but,

18
00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:24.065
but I think it's profound, right?

19
00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:25.625
I think this movie is so deep.

20
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:27.745
Uh, it gives a pretty good picture of

21
00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:31.705
what goes on in our brains every day of our lives.

22
00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:36.465
Now, when it came out, our boys were six, four and one

23
00:01:36.465 --> 00:01:37.585
and a half at the time.

24
00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:39.785
And so it was first released, Emily

25
00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:42.585
and I, my wife, we went out and saw it in the theaters.

26
00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:45.705
Now, if you know the story, you know, that uh,

27
00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:46.985
this family moves

28
00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:48.545
and this, this daughter has to go

29
00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:49.945
through all the emotions of that.

30
00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:51.585
And so we're sitting there

31
00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:55.505
having just moved from Weatherford to Fort Worth,

32
00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:58.305
and we're sitting there regretting our life choices,

33
00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.825
just thinking that we've ruined our kids' lives.

34
00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:03.065
We're openly weeping in the theater.

35
00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:04.985
Just, it's a travesty, right?

36
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:06.745
It was horrible to watch

37
00:02:06.975 --> 00:02:08.585
that movie at that moment in our lives.

38
00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:12.625
Uh, but one of the characters in the film

39
00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:14.385
is Joy.

40
00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:17.505
That's the emotion character named Joy.

41
00:02:17.565 --> 00:02:18.825
And she's usually the one trying

42
00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:20.745
to keep everybody else on track, trying

43
00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:21.545
to keep everybody in the same

44
00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:23.345
direction in those kind of ways.

45
00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:27.545
And yet we discover she's often misguided in her actions.

46
00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:29.425
She's misunderstanding

47
00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:32.625
how the world is working as she goes forward.

48
00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:35.665
Because at times she denies reality.

49
00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:40.025
There's a, there's a fake kind of joy

50
00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:42.985
that she presents throughout the movie

51
00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:46.025
and she tries to cover what's really happening

52
00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.465
with this just overabundance of peppiness,

53
00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.185
like just denying reality.

54
00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:52.745
Like, no, no, no, we're all gonna be okay.

55
00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:54.785
It's all gonna be fine. No, no, no. Don't, don't go.

56
00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:57.185
Don't get sad. Don't get depressed. Like this is not okay.

57
00:02:57.285 --> 00:02:58.345
We gotta be happy.

58
00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:04.035
Well, listen, that's not the kind of joy

59
00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:05.715
we're talking about today.

60
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.305
The joy we're talking about today is a deep seated,

61
00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:15.065
deep rooted, solid foundation kind of joy.

62
00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:20.225
Something that's not dependent on circumstances,

63
00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:23.545
but dependent on certainty.

64
00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:29.355
And here's why this is so important today, because you

65
00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:30.915
and I are often told

66
00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.545
or at least expected to be like joy from the movie,

67
00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:41.745
like we are to present this front, we're

68
00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:45.065
to put on a face because that's just expected of us.

69
00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:47.745
That just like another movie, everything is awesome.

70
00:03:48.045 --> 00:03:49.305
We gotta act like it is.

71
00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:51.505
Nobody can have anything said, you got, it.

72
00:03:51.505 --> 00:03:53.465
Doesn't matter what's going on behind the curtain

73
00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:55.745
of your life, that it's a really hard situation.

74
00:03:56.085 --> 00:04:00.435
You have to act like it's all okay, that's the temptation.

75
00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:04.035
Or maybe even the explicit expectation in our world.

76
00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:08.935
Or maybe this is important for you today

77
00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:11.295
because you just aren't that joyful.

78
00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:16.515
Like you have a pretty sour outlook on the world

79
00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:18.875
for whatever reason.

80
00:04:19.055 --> 00:04:20.235
And, and really, honestly,

81
00:04:20.235 --> 00:04:21.555
you're just kind of hard to be around.

82
00:04:25.295 --> 00:04:27.505
This is so important today

83
00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:31.875
because the Bible commands us to rejoice.

84
00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:37.775
And, and the command to rejoice in the Bible is

85
00:04:38.505 --> 00:04:40.175
above circumstances.

86
00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:48.255
It is grounded in hope, not circumstance, grounded in hope.

87
00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:52.615
And because of that hope, it is then reasonable

88
00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:55.575
to rejoice because of the hope.

89
00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:00.925
This is one of the major marks of what it means to be

90
00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:02.805
a follower of Christ.

91
00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:05.085
This idea of joy, it's a fruit of the spirit,

92
00:05:06.185 --> 00:05:10.445
but it, it's clearly marked out as one of the things we need

93
00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:11.885
to be pursuing.

94
00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.765
And so let's just start by praying.

95
00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:14.925
'cause I know not all of you

96
00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:16.125
walked in here, are really joyful.

97
00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:19.565
And so let's start by praying for joy in the Lord.

98
00:05:20.405 --> 00:05:23.165
Wherever your walk is with him today, let's pray

99
00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:24.605
for joy in him.

100
00:05:24.665 --> 00:05:28.485
So God, we do come to you humbly now asking you

101
00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:32.005
and needing you to by your spirit, those

102
00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:35.125
who are believers in this room, by your spirit, infuse

103
00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:37.965
a level of joy that we maybe have never seen

104
00:05:38.065 --> 00:05:42.435
or maybe needed again, from where we're at in life,

105
00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:48.035
not just emotional happiness, but but a deep joy in you.

106
00:05:48.095 --> 00:05:50.235
God, show us what that means through your word today

107
00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:54.835
and make it a reality in us for your glory, for our good,

108
00:05:54.835 --> 00:05:59.285
for the world's good as we'll see in in Jesus' name, amen.

109
00:06:01.585 --> 00:06:03.205
So as we're walking through Romans 12,

110
00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:05.005
we're taking it not just verse by verse,

111
00:06:05.015 --> 00:06:07.245
we're actually taking it phrase by phrase

112
00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:11.925
and looking, examining it, what a life transformed

113
00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:13.565
by Christ looks like.

114
00:06:14.505 --> 00:06:17.605
And remember that we're looking at Christ as the standard

115
00:06:18.265 --> 00:06:22.845
by which we measure everything like our walk with him,

116
00:06:22.905 --> 00:06:26.765
we align with him, we measure our lives off of him.

117
00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:29.605
We don't compare ourselves to the world

118
00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:30.885
or to any other standard

119
00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:33.525
because yeah, we could compare ourselves to somebody else,

120
00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:35.325
but, but that means we're still off

121
00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:37.085
or compare ourselves to the way of the world,

122
00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:38.245
but it means we're still off.

123
00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:42.245
No, we have to go back to comparing ourselves to Christ

124
00:06:42.705 --> 00:06:45.645
and then realigning ourselves back to

125
00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:47.885
him more closely every day.

126
00:06:49.435 --> 00:06:51.615
And that's what we're doing in this series.

127
00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:53.175
And today specifically,

128
00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:55.775
we're studying just the first three words

129
00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.655
of Romans 12, verse 12.

130
00:06:58.645 --> 00:07:00.815
They'll be on your notes, they're on the app,

131
00:07:00.815 --> 00:07:03.095
they're on the screen, but it's just the three, the phrase

132
00:07:03.855 --> 00:07:05.255
rejoice in hope.

133
00:07:06.675 --> 00:07:11.135
That's it. Verse 12, the first three words, rejoice in hope.

134
00:07:11.135 --> 00:07:14.215
And again, he's talking to those who believe in Christ.

135
00:07:14.325 --> 00:07:16.295
He's talking to those who've been born again

136
00:07:16.295 --> 00:07:18.055
through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

137
00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:21.575
Those who have been experiencing this reality of,

138
00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:24.335
of offering themselves as living sacrifices to God.

139
00:07:24.515 --> 00:07:26.415
And they've, they've seen that.

140
00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:28.735
That's what's now transforming them.

141
00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:32.495
And this then is one of the main markers of what it means

142
00:07:32.495 --> 00:07:36.245
to be a Christian, to rejoice in hope.

143
00:07:36.475 --> 00:07:40.005
This idea of being joyful, that your life is marked

144
00:07:40.505 --> 00:07:44.325
by a deep rooted joy because of your God.

145
00:07:47.105 --> 00:07:48.765
And so as we get into this, look first

146
00:07:49.015 --> 00:07:52.805
where this command is grounded, notice first

147
00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:54.405
where this command is grounded.

148
00:07:54.555 --> 00:07:58.485
It's dependent on hope here, not on happiness.

149
00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:04.555
It's grounded in hope, not happiness.

150
00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:09.305
And what is happiness? Well, happiness is

151
00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:12.185
that circumstances in your life feel good.

152
00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:14.585
Just think about it. So your,

153
00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:17.105
your good friends throw you a birthday party, you're happy,

154
00:08:17.805 --> 00:08:20.265
you get a raise at work, you're happy, you

155
00:08:20.805 --> 00:08:22.985
see your health improve, you're happy.

156
00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.625
The thunder, wind, you're happy, you get a new puppy,

157
00:08:26.085 --> 00:08:27.225
you're happy, right?

158
00:08:27.295 --> 00:08:28.625
Like some of you look at that.

159
00:08:28.645 --> 00:08:30.505
I'm like, just happy because you see the picture, right?

160
00:08:30.765 --> 00:08:31.865
That's the way it is.

161
00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:38.195
Here's the problem with happiness based joy though.

162
00:08:40.285 --> 00:08:45.125
If your happiness depends on happenings, then

163
00:08:46.745 --> 00:08:49.035
it is circumstantial.

164
00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:52.555
It's it's dependent on circumstances that are at times

165
00:08:52.745 --> 00:08:54.075
outside of your control.

166
00:08:56.845 --> 00:09:00.225
And so here's the problem, like, like you, you see

167
00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:05.225
circumstances change and you had nothing to do with it.

168
00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:07.105
But if you're dependent on that for happiness,

169
00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:08.985
then it would fade.

170
00:09:09.965 --> 00:09:12.905
Now let me be clear as we go into this that circumstances

171
00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:16.865
can be appropriate sources of gratitude

172
00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:19.605
and joy like getting married

173
00:09:20.995 --> 00:09:25.605
or becoming a father or being able to be generous

174
00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:27.245
and to help someone financially.

175
00:09:27.855 --> 00:09:31.925
Those are gifts from the Lord and those are circumstances.

176
00:09:32.385 --> 00:09:37.285
So it's not wrong to rejoice in those good gifts

177
00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:39.485
as you see 'em from that good gifts from God.

178
00:09:39.915 --> 00:09:43.725
They just can't be the final hope.

179
00:09:45.215 --> 00:09:48.175
'cause think about how quickly those things can be taken

180
00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:51.645
away from you, how quickly those things can change.

181
00:09:52.435 --> 00:09:55.325
They're good gifts from God. Rejoice, don't get sad.

182
00:09:55.335 --> 00:09:57.605
Don't be sorry about having good gifts from God,

183
00:09:57.865 --> 00:09:59.845
but don't let that be the ultimate hope.

184
00:09:59.905 --> 00:10:01.045
You need more stability.

185
00:10:04.455 --> 00:10:09.155
That's why the superior foundation is hope not happiness.

186
00:10:11.345 --> 00:10:14.845
And when you hear the word hope in our world that is often

187
00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:17.285
construed like wishful thinking,

188
00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:19.885
like I hope the thunder wind tomorrow night.

189
00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.725
Well, that's just a wishful thing. We have no idea.

190
00:10:22.385 --> 00:10:23.845
And so we hope in something,

191
00:10:23.845 --> 00:10:27.285
but it's not wishful thinking in the biblical sense of hope.

192
00:10:27.475 --> 00:10:31.565
Hope is confident expectation in God's promises.

193
00:10:33.195 --> 00:10:37.285
It's what Hebrews 11 says Verse one,

194
00:10:37.535 --> 00:10:41.445
faith is the assurance of things hoped for.

195
00:10:41.945 --> 00:10:45.045
The conviction of things not seen.

196
00:10:46.235 --> 00:10:47.485
Like you see how it ties hope

197
00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:49.925
and faith, conviction, assurance,

198
00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:51.605
it ties all of that together.

199
00:10:51.915 --> 00:10:53.925
That hope is not just, well, I hope that happens.

200
00:10:54.115 --> 00:10:55.885
Hope is like, no, this is what I know.

201
00:10:56.035 --> 00:10:57.885
This is something that's going to be certain.

202
00:10:58.115 --> 00:11:02.725
There's a steadfastness to it. Things that we know for sure.

203
00:11:02.835 --> 00:11:03.845
What do we know for sure?

204
00:11:04.155 --> 00:11:06.245
It's the unshakeable foundation

205
00:11:06.585 --> 00:11:08.445
of Christ's finished work for us.

206
00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:13.085
We know, we know that has happened.

207
00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:17.705
Christian hope rests on that, that God

208
00:11:18.305 --> 00:11:22.025
promised a redeemer, God delivered a redeemer doing

209
00:11:22.025 --> 00:11:25.025
everything that was necessary to accomplish our salvation.

210
00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:28.865
That's where our hope rests. That's where our hope lies.

211
00:11:28.895 --> 00:11:31.345
It's not changeable that

212
00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:32.785
because of what Jesus did,

213
00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:37.265
we will one day also be freed from all the sufferings.

214
00:11:37.265 --> 00:11:41.385
This present time brings us Jesus resurrected

215
00:11:41.385 --> 00:11:42.785
so we will be resurrected.

216
00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:43.825
That's what Romans eight says.

217
00:11:43.845 --> 00:11:46.545
It connects our hope to things not yet seen

218
00:11:46.765 --> 00:11:49.545
but still just as certain in God's plan.

219
00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:53.075
That's what Romans 8 24

220
00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:56.925
and 25 says, for in this hope we were saved.

221
00:11:57.385 --> 00:12:00.245
Now, hope that is seen is not hope for

222
00:12:00.265 --> 00:12:01.565
who hopes for what he sees.

223
00:12:01.705 --> 00:12:05.205
But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it

224
00:12:05.205 --> 00:12:06.365
with patience.

225
00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:09.725
It's saying we can act as if it's already happened.

226
00:12:09.785 --> 00:12:13.525
We are looking forward to something that we can't see yet,

227
00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:15.965
but we're confident in it anyway.

228
00:12:19.615 --> 00:12:20.635
And so here's what happens

229
00:12:20.745 --> 00:12:23.435
because this command

230
00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:27.515
to rejoice is grounded in hope, not in circumstances.

231
00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:31.595
That means when circumstances in your life threaten

232
00:12:32.135 --> 00:12:35.965
to crush you, hope is what sustains you.

233
00:12:39.145 --> 00:12:40.795
When your feelings fail you

234
00:12:40.975 --> 00:12:45.155
and you don't see a way out hope

235
00:12:45.745 --> 00:12:47.195
endures through that.

236
00:12:50.005 --> 00:12:54.115
When the future looks dark, hope

237
00:12:54.865 --> 00:12:57.315
sees the glory that is coming in Jesus Christ.

238
00:12:59.075 --> 00:13:00.815
See, it looks past what you can see

239
00:13:02.435 --> 00:13:04.855
to a guarantee in the future.

240
00:13:05.955 --> 00:13:07.815
And see, that's why listen, that's why

241
00:13:07.815 --> 00:13:11.615
because of the substance of this solid hope,

242
00:13:11.615 --> 00:13:14.295
because of what it is, that's then

243
00:13:14.445 --> 00:13:17.335
what makes our rejoicing reasonable

244
00:13:19.795 --> 00:13:22.485
because of what it contains, because of what it is.

245
00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:26.615
That's what makes our rejoicing reasonable, normal expected.

246
00:13:26.645 --> 00:13:27.855
Like this is what we do

247
00:13:27.965 --> 00:13:32.535
because the content of our hope in Christ is such as it is.

248
00:13:32.795 --> 00:13:35.535
It makes us rejoicing

249
00:13:35.955 --> 00:13:39.905
as natural 'cause.

250
00:13:39.905 --> 00:13:41.745
Just think about where our hope rests.

251
00:13:42.925 --> 00:13:46.665
Our hope is not in some fickle, some some temporary thing.

252
00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:49.425
Our hope rests what makes up our hope.

253
00:13:49.565 --> 00:13:50.985
Our hope rests in things like this.

254
00:13:51.245 --> 00:13:53.385
One Corinthians 15 says that just

255
00:13:53.385 --> 00:13:55.825
as Christ has been raised from the dead,

256
00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:59.105
those in him will also be made eternally alive.

257
00:13:59.165 --> 00:14:01.345
One day like

258
00:14:01.345 --> 00:14:04.985
because Jesus resurrected 2000 years ago,

259
00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:08.785
we in him will one day be resurrected eternally

260
00:14:09.005 --> 00:14:11.025
as well, guaranteed.

261
00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:16.605
Romans eight verse 30, it guarantees our glorification,

262
00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:19.565
meaning that moment we're made holy, made perfect,

263
00:14:19.755 --> 00:14:21.365
made whole before God.

264
00:14:21.515 --> 00:14:23.165
That day we see him face to face.

265
00:14:23.795 --> 00:14:26.085
It's as if it has already happened.

266
00:14:27.295 --> 00:14:29.665
Justification, sanctification, glorification.

267
00:14:29.855 --> 00:14:31.665
It's as if it's all already happened.

268
00:14:31.855 --> 00:14:36.805
It's that guaranteed you have one

269
00:14:36.805 --> 00:14:37.805
Peter one, three

270
00:14:37.805 --> 00:14:40.925
and four shares about this certain future

271
00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:45.485
inheritance in heaven that is kept by God for you.

272
00:14:47.815 --> 00:14:50.105
It's a certain inheritance coming in the future.

273
00:14:50.245 --> 00:14:54.165
One Peter said that second Peter three 13 reminds us

274
00:14:54.345 --> 00:14:56.205
of God's promise of a new heavens

275
00:14:56.305 --> 00:14:59.845
and new earth that is coming, that's full of righteousness.

276
00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:01.965
It dwells there. That means all

277
00:15:01.965 --> 00:15:03.805
of creation is gonna be transformed.

278
00:15:04.115 --> 00:15:05.525
This is not all there is

279
00:15:07.665 --> 00:15:09.565
and it's coming in the future.

280
00:15:11.545 --> 00:15:15.005
So you take all that together here. Here's the point.

281
00:15:15.185 --> 00:15:19.785
You take all that together, the magnitude

282
00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:23.785
of what awaits us, dwarfs

283
00:15:24.335 --> 00:15:25.425
present suffering.

284
00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:32.735
You hear that? Like if all of that is coming,

285
00:15:33.035 --> 00:15:35.735
if, if all of that is guaranteed, the things

286
00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:39.335
that are in the future for us, all the magnitude of that

287
00:15:40.075 --> 00:15:43.375
dwarfs present difficulties.

288
00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:48.755
And listen, I know I'm not, I'm not denying reality here.

289
00:15:48.955 --> 00:15:51.595
I know life can get very hard.

290
00:15:54.175 --> 00:15:56.705
Even for some of you today, this Father's day thing,

291
00:15:57.205 --> 00:15:59.665
it brings up a unique pain in your soul

292
00:16:01.285 --> 00:16:03.105
for various reasons, whatever it is.

293
00:16:03.805 --> 00:16:04.825
And today hurts.

294
00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:09.235
I know life can get very hard

295
00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:11.675
and as hard as life can be some days

296
00:16:13.265 --> 00:16:17.315
it's not even close to how great it will be someday.

297
00:16:19.235 --> 00:16:22.565
Like as low as it can get, as hard as it can get today,

298
00:16:23.245 --> 00:16:25.245
tomorrow, next week, 10 years ago.

299
00:16:25.465 --> 00:16:26.965
As hard as it can get.

300
00:16:27.155 --> 00:16:30.965
It's not even on the same page, same wavelength as as good

301
00:16:31.185 --> 00:16:33.805
as it will be someday in heaven.

302
00:16:37.305 --> 00:16:40.485
So what Romans eight 18 reminds us of that the sufferings

303
00:16:40.485 --> 00:16:44.685
of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory

304
00:16:44.835 --> 00:16:46.245
that is to be revealed to us.

305
00:16:49.955 --> 00:16:53.695
That's why this hope we're talking about is what compels

306
00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:56.805
joy, that kind of hope.

307
00:16:57.645 --> 00:16:59.965
'cause our hope is not doubtful, it's not fickle,

308
00:17:00.075 --> 00:17:01.405
it's not feelings based.

309
00:17:01.745 --> 00:17:05.045
Our hope is guaranteed by God's character

310
00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:06.845
and God's promises to us.

311
00:17:09.035 --> 00:17:12.335
And if what we hope for is infinitely valuable

312
00:17:12.555 --> 00:17:14.135
and absolutely certain,

313
00:17:14.565 --> 00:17:17.175
then present joy is not just possible.

314
00:17:17.475 --> 00:17:19.095
It is actually rational.

315
00:17:20.325 --> 00:17:23.015
Like if that's what we have coming for us, if that's

316
00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:27.695
what God is giving us, it's possible and rational to praise

317
00:17:28.075 --> 00:17:30.135
and rejoice today that

318
00:17:30.135 --> 00:17:33.335
that future will be far better than this today.

319
00:17:34.955 --> 00:17:36.055
Why wouldn't we be joyful?

320
00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:42.685
Listen, to not rejoice in that kind of hope

321
00:17:44.985 --> 00:17:49.925
would be to doubt either its value or it's certainty.

322
00:17:52.465 --> 00:17:54.795
Like if it's rational to, to joy, have joy

323
00:17:54.795 --> 00:17:57.795
and rejoice in it, to not rejoice would then be we're

324
00:17:57.795 --> 00:18:00.805
doubting its value or we're doubting its certainty,

325
00:18:01.905 --> 00:18:03.195
then maybe it's not really gonna happen.

326
00:18:03.195 --> 00:18:04.475
Maybe God didn't guarantee it

327
00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:08.925
or maybe you don't see the future

328
00:18:09.445 --> 00:18:11.485
resurrection in Christ as that big a deal.

329
00:18:13.465 --> 00:18:15.805
Of course you're not gonna rejoice if you don't believe it's

330
00:18:15.805 --> 00:18:16.765
gonna happen or if it's like

331
00:18:16.765 --> 00:18:17.965
that's not that big a deal to me.

332
00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:20.205
Of course you won't rejoice in it today.

333
00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:23.965
Or maybe, maybe you don't see heaven and see righteousness

334
00:18:24.105 --> 00:18:26.645
and, and even the fact that you'll see Jesus face to face.

335
00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:29.525
Maybe you don't see that as actually more valuable than

336
00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:30.645
what we have here today.

337
00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:34.375
Well then of course you're not gonna rejoice in what's

338
00:18:34.375 --> 00:18:38.045
coming because it's not that much better, if any.

339
00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:45.105
You see how tragic that is that we see this

340
00:18:45.105 --> 00:18:47.985
as more valuable than what God is offering us in the future.

341
00:18:47.985 --> 00:18:49.025
That's tragic.

342
00:18:49.445 --> 00:18:53.625
That's why joy, it it it's almost a sense of an act

343
00:18:53.625 --> 00:18:56.145
of faith in God's promises.

344
00:18:58.005 --> 00:19:00.125
'cause you have to look past this stuff right here.

345
00:19:00.145 --> 00:19:01.325
You have to look past good

346
00:19:01.585 --> 00:19:04.325
and bad here to see something future.

347
00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:08.245
And so you have to, in a sense, act of faith, choose to say,

348
00:19:08.245 --> 00:19:10.765
okay, God, I I know you're bringing all this stuff.

349
00:19:11.205 --> 00:19:12.725
I know you're bringing all these things.

350
00:19:13.145 --> 00:19:16.445
And so God, I choose joy to

351
00:19:17.045 --> 00:19:18.845
rejoice in that certain hope.

352
00:19:19.065 --> 00:19:20.885
I'm not just choosing joy in spite of things.

353
00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:25.125
I'm choosing joy in that in you. That's coming.

354
00:19:29.525 --> 00:19:31.245
I you've seen it too in your life.

355
00:19:31.245 --> 00:19:35.885
But I, I watch friends lose a spouse or

356
00:19:35.885 --> 00:19:39.895
or lose children or get a cancer diagnosis

357
00:19:40.155 --> 00:19:41.415
or lose a job

358
00:19:43.335 --> 00:19:46.675
and it astounds me every single time I'll,

359
00:19:46.675 --> 00:19:48.755
I'll have a conversation with them personally

360
00:19:48.775 --> 00:19:51.915
or they'll stand here on this stage at a funeral speaking

361
00:19:52.215 --> 00:19:54.235
and I'll hear them say things like,

362
00:19:54.615 --> 00:19:57.035
it hurts deeper than anything I've ever hurt before.

363
00:19:57.305 --> 00:19:59.835
It's to my core. I'll never get over it. Yes.

364
00:19:59.975 --> 00:20:04.895
But my hope is Jesus, I can continue

365
00:20:04.895 --> 00:20:08.685
because of Jesus and listen that I mean it.

366
00:20:08.685 --> 00:20:13.325
It is overwhelming to me to watch that happen, to hear

367
00:20:13.325 --> 00:20:15.125
that happen when somebody who has gone

368
00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:16.245
through the hardest moment,

369
00:20:16.505 --> 00:20:18.365
the worst thing you can ever imagine,

370
00:20:18.585 --> 00:20:21.565
and they're staying, they're still saying, my hope is Jesus.

371
00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:26.275
My hope is Jesus. Listen,

372
00:20:26.275 --> 00:20:27.915
that's maturity in Christ.

373
00:20:29.235 --> 00:20:33.175
That's not being wavered by the winds of life and the world.

374
00:20:33.405 --> 00:20:36.975
It's not being swayed by anything. It's confident assurance.

375
00:20:37.165 --> 00:20:41.215
That is one of the main markers of mature Christian living

376
00:20:44.255 --> 00:20:48.845
that is maturity in Christ to to rejoice in hope

377
00:20:49.035 --> 00:20:53.755
through pain, to have

378
00:20:53.895 --> 00:20:57.315
joy in the midst of dark chaos all around you.

379
00:20:59.295 --> 00:21:02.705
That that's a marker of mature Christian living.

380
00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.595
Because listen, how much easier is it? We all know this.

381
00:21:07.695 --> 00:21:10.915
How much easier is it to look at our present circumstances

382
00:21:11.215 --> 00:21:14.355
for measures of joy and happiness, right?

383
00:21:14.355 --> 00:21:15.675
We look at how we feel that day

384
00:21:15.675 --> 00:21:16.835
or how things are going in our

385
00:21:16.835 --> 00:21:17.915
lives or whatever it is, right?

386
00:21:17.935 --> 00:21:20.875
We we do that. We all do that. And it's easy.

387
00:21:21.305 --> 00:21:24.275
It's a lot easier to do that than it is to look

388
00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:27.435
for the unseen future promises of God,

389
00:21:27.455 --> 00:21:28.635
to find our hope there.

390
00:21:28.865 --> 00:21:31.755
It's easier to try to find it here than it is

391
00:21:31.755 --> 00:21:32.875
to find it there.

392
00:21:34.055 --> 00:21:37.395
But mature believers in Christ have learned how

393
00:21:37.615 --> 00:21:41.235
to find their joy in unseen realities,

394
00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:45.145
in the guarantee of resurrection of the future,

395
00:21:45.445 --> 00:21:48.105
in the guarantee of their glorification in the future,

396
00:21:49.325 --> 00:21:51.825
in the inheritance that they're gonna get in heaven

397
00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:54.385
that's kept for them there in the new heavens

398
00:21:54.445 --> 00:21:55.745
and new earth where there'll be no more

399
00:21:55.745 --> 00:21:56.945
pain and sorrow and suffering.

400
00:21:57.095 --> 00:21:58.585
They, they know that's coming.

401
00:21:58.765 --> 00:22:00.865
That's where they find their joy. That's maturity.

402
00:22:04.545 --> 00:22:07.575
And so I'm talking to these people trying

403
00:22:07.575 --> 00:22:09.055
to discern like how, how do you get there?

404
00:22:10.735 --> 00:22:12.075
And the thing I keep hearing over

405
00:22:12.075 --> 00:22:13.835
and over again is that it's not automatic.

406
00:22:15.475 --> 00:22:17.735
You don't just wake up one day and find that hope

407
00:22:18.255 --> 00:22:20.295
whenever the the world comes crashing down on you.

408
00:22:22.665 --> 00:22:25.075
It's not automatic. This kind of Romans 12 rejoicing

409
00:22:25.075 --> 00:22:26.195
and hope is not automatic.

410
00:22:26.195 --> 00:22:29.155
It requires intentional focus

411
00:22:29.575 --> 00:22:32.635
and discipline to remind yourselves

412
00:22:32.895 --> 00:22:35.595
of all these truths every day.

413
00:22:35.775 --> 00:22:39.785
Not just when you hit the worst moments To remind

414
00:22:39.785 --> 00:22:41.785
and discipline yourself over and over

415
00:22:41.965 --> 00:22:46.225
and over, recalling to your heart daily, these things

416
00:22:46.455 --> 00:22:48.585
that we possess in Christ.

417
00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:51.865
We're preaching the gospel to ourselves every day reminding

418
00:22:51.865 --> 00:22:55.425
ourselves that Jesus lived, died, resurrected, ascended,

419
00:22:55.445 --> 00:22:58.145
and he's coming back one day to fix all this mess.

420
00:22:58.325 --> 00:23:00.585
We keep preaching ourselves that message

421
00:23:00.805 --> 00:23:01.945
and that he did all of that.

422
00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:03.625
He gave us graciously,

423
00:23:03.855 --> 00:23:06.145
gave us all these things I just described,

424
00:23:06.145 --> 00:23:07.305
the substance of our hope.

425
00:23:07.485 --> 00:23:09.145
He gave us all of that. Why?

426
00:23:09.145 --> 00:23:11.585
Because he loves us more than we can ever imagine.

427
00:23:12.085 --> 00:23:13.425
And you keep preaching yourself

428
00:23:13.735 --> 00:23:16.665
that message till it sinks down into your heart.

429
00:23:17.055 --> 00:23:19.785
That is what grows your maturity.

430
00:23:21.485 --> 00:23:24.295
It's what grows your joy in the Lord

431
00:23:25.835 --> 00:23:27.785
and hope in the future.

432
00:23:30.845 --> 00:23:32.865
But lemme give you a picture of what the enemy wants to do

433
00:23:32.865 --> 00:23:33.985
to you in that process.

434
00:23:35.265 --> 00:23:37.565
The enemy of your soul trying to derail all of that.

435
00:23:37.565 --> 00:23:38.965
What does he try to do? What's his?

436
00:23:39.025 --> 00:23:42.045
What's one of his main ways to come at you in this process?

437
00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:46.475
Here's what he does. He tempts you

438
00:23:46.975 --> 00:23:51.115
to focus on present problems

439
00:23:51.775 --> 00:23:53.995
rather than future glory.

440
00:23:56.605 --> 00:23:59.625
He want to get, he wants to get your eyes on all

441
00:23:59.625 --> 00:24:03.865
of the mess, all the problems you're facing at school

442
00:24:04.165 --> 00:24:06.065
or at work or at home or financially.

443
00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:07.425
He's like, look at your health.

444
00:24:07.565 --> 00:24:11.385
He wants you to focus on the present problems rather than

445
00:24:11.385 --> 00:24:13.585
looking at future glory.

446
00:24:18.665 --> 00:24:21.005
But when I think of that, it makes me think of Paul

447
00:24:21.005 --> 00:24:23.775
and Silas in the book of Acts.

448
00:24:23.805 --> 00:24:26.375
Paul and Silas were in prison

449
00:24:27.595 --> 00:24:31.255
and don't think prison today like nasty dungeon like prison

450
00:24:31.775 --> 00:24:33.015
probably in stocks where their hands

451
00:24:33.035 --> 00:24:34.615
and feet were through pieces

452
00:24:34.635 --> 00:24:35.855
of wood that they couldn't move.

453
00:24:39.025 --> 00:24:42.675
And yet what were they doing? They're singing hymns.

454
00:24:42.675 --> 00:24:44.755
They're praying boldly, loudly.

455
00:24:44.945 --> 00:24:48.995
They're joy filled believers in the midst of one

456
00:24:48.995 --> 00:24:50.515
of the worst situations you can ever imagine.

457
00:24:54.865 --> 00:24:58.325
You know what that tells me? That they had cultivated,

458
00:24:58.325 --> 00:25:02.205
they had fought for joy for years and years in Christ.

459
00:25:02.395 --> 00:25:04.125
They had trained their minds

460
00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:07.525
and their hearts to fight for joy in the Lord beyond

461
00:25:07.555 --> 00:25:09.045
what they could see in the moment.

462
00:25:09.275 --> 00:25:12.845
They knew something future was better than this.

463
00:25:13.865 --> 00:25:18.745
So in the moment they could react with joy, not

464
00:25:18.745 --> 00:25:21.025
with getting crushed by their circumstances.

465
00:25:24.745 --> 00:25:26.045
Here's what happens when you do that though.

466
00:25:26.425 --> 00:25:27.565
It happens for Paul and Silas.

467
00:25:27.565 --> 00:25:29.325
But here's what for you and me when we do that,

468
00:25:29.355 --> 00:25:31.645
when we fight for joy, here's what that kind

469
00:25:31.645 --> 00:25:32.805
of joy actually does.

470
00:25:33.305 --> 00:25:36.965
It demonstrates the supernatural nature

471
00:25:37.265 --> 00:25:38.725
and power of the gospel.

472
00:25:40.765 --> 00:25:42.925
'cause that's not natural, that's not normal,

473
00:25:42.985 --> 00:25:45.205
that's not innate to us in our flesh.

474
00:25:45.385 --> 00:25:48.085
For us to rejoice in hope, in the midst of the pain

475
00:25:48.085 --> 00:25:49.085
and suffering of the world.

476
00:25:49.105 --> 00:25:50.805
That's not natural. We wanna go hide.

477
00:25:50.825 --> 00:25:53.005
We wanna go crawl in the corner and give up.

478
00:25:53.145 --> 00:25:54.405
That's natural to us.

479
00:25:54.625 --> 00:25:58.645
What's supernatural is the power of God working through us.

480
00:25:58.865 --> 00:26:00.445
It shows the world something

481
00:26:00.555 --> 00:26:02.805
that is not dependent on our circumstances.

482
00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:07.495
That when your family is falling apart,

483
00:26:07.915 --> 00:26:10.375
yet you have a steady faith through it

484
00:26:10.725 --> 00:26:13.495
that shines pretty bright in a world it's dark

485
00:26:16.725 --> 00:26:20.215
When you lose your job, yet the temperature of your soul

486
00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:24.655
burns hot for Jesus in the midst of all of that, that is

487
00:26:25.695 --> 00:26:27.175
standing out in a dark world

488
00:26:30.705 --> 00:26:34.475
when your peer group at school sets you aside

489
00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:36.955
because you are not going to participate in the same things

490
00:26:36.955 --> 00:26:38.155
that they participate in.

491
00:26:38.775 --> 00:26:42.195
Yet you still walk with a humble confidence in the Lord,

492
00:26:42.225 --> 00:26:43.485
your head held, held high

493
00:26:43.485 --> 00:26:45.565
because your identities in Christ, not in

494
00:26:45.565 --> 00:26:46.765
what everybody else says about you.

495
00:26:47.185 --> 00:26:49.285
And that is what stands out in the world.

496
00:26:49.285 --> 00:26:50.285
Because that's only God

497
00:26:54.895 --> 00:26:56.185
like this kind of joy here.

498
00:26:56.325 --> 00:27:00.305
See this today, this kind of joy is an evangelistic witness

499
00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:03.185
to the glory and goodness of our God.

500
00:27:05.425 --> 00:27:06.805
It shines bright.

501
00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:10.885
'cause the world is very dark, very, very much

502
00:27:11.995 --> 00:27:14.415
anti true joy.

503
00:27:15.285 --> 00:27:16.855
It's gotta be good conditions.

504
00:27:16.855 --> 00:27:19.735
It's gotta be good circumstances. This is evangelistic.

505
00:27:19.845 --> 00:27:23.455
When we have joy, your hope filled joy, no matter

506
00:27:23.455 --> 00:27:26.135
what you face in life, becomes a beacon

507
00:27:26.565 --> 00:27:28.535
that points other people to our God.

508
00:27:33.465 --> 00:27:35.605
That's why one of our, a few years ago we did this

509
00:27:35.605 --> 00:27:38.725
as a church, one of our new values is

510
00:27:38.725 --> 00:27:41.165
what we call life giving hope.

511
00:27:42.735 --> 00:27:44.995
One of the things that we have a goal of as a church is

512
00:27:44.995 --> 00:27:49.235
that we are going to reflect the gospel of Jesus Christ

513
00:27:49.505 --> 00:27:53.405
with delight by building relationships

514
00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:58.645
and environments infused with grace and joy.

515
00:28:00.955 --> 00:28:05.205
That that we want this place to be a yes, it exciting we,

516
00:28:05.245 --> 00:28:08.445
we want people to, to feel good about being around here,

517
00:28:08.445 --> 00:28:12.725
but, but what we want more is that God would show through us

518
00:28:12.995 --> 00:28:16.125
that there is a deep root of joy

519
00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:18.845
because of the hope we have in him.

520
00:28:19.595 --> 00:28:22.605
That when everything falls apart, when our lives crumble

521
00:28:22.705 --> 00:28:25.885
and everything looks horrible, that people look at us

522
00:28:25.985 --> 00:28:27.085
as a church and they're like,

523
00:28:29.095 --> 00:28:30.475
what's different about you guys?

524
00:28:31.225 --> 00:28:33.835
There's a life there that nobody else

525
00:28:34.455 --> 00:28:35.455
Has.

526
00:28:36.155 --> 00:28:39.375
What is it? It's hope, it's

527
00:28:39.675 --> 00:28:43.015
Joy, it the Lord as our Strength.

528
00:28:45.575 --> 00:28:48.155
So how do we cultivate that? Right?

529
00:28:48.155 --> 00:28:49.395
Well, that's what we want.

530
00:28:50.045 --> 00:28:52.955
Again, most of us walked in here, probably not full board,

531
00:28:53.155 --> 00:28:54.475
a hundred percent joy on this.

532
00:28:54.495 --> 00:28:55.795
So, so how do we cultivate that?

533
00:28:55.855 --> 00:28:56.875
How do you, how do you

534
00:28:56.875 --> 00:29:00.195
and I mature into this kind of hope filled

535
00:29:01.035 --> 00:29:04.155
rejoicing person as a follower of Christ?

536
00:29:04.265 --> 00:29:06.715
Well, it's not really that complicated.

537
00:29:08.975 --> 00:29:12.775
I'm not saying it's easy, but it's not complicated.

538
00:29:14.475 --> 00:29:15.605
Just a couple examples.

539
00:29:17.575 --> 00:29:21.005
Start by meditating regularly on the promises

540
00:29:21.005 --> 00:29:22.645
of God in scripture.

541
00:29:24.825 --> 00:29:26.355
Like you heard me just a few minutes ago,

542
00:29:26.455 --> 00:29:31.355
the passages I shared about our future inheritance,

543
00:29:31.355 --> 00:29:33.555
about our glorification, about the future, resurrection,

544
00:29:33.555 --> 00:29:35.955
about these promises of God and what he's done

545
00:29:36.095 --> 00:29:37.835
and what he will do.

546
00:29:37.985 --> 00:29:40.995
Just take those in, soak them into your,

547
00:29:41.085 --> 00:29:42.525
your soul regularly.

548
00:29:43.355 --> 00:29:45.765
Just go over 'em over and over like again and again. Again.

549
00:29:45.765 --> 00:29:47.805
Keep preaching those to you every single

550
00:29:47.905 --> 00:29:48.965
day moment by moment.

551
00:29:49.285 --> 00:29:50.725
Memorize them so you don't forget.

552
00:29:50.725 --> 00:29:53.845
These are the things God has promised. Hold onto those.

553
00:29:55.255 --> 00:29:57.345
He's proven himself to be trustworthy. I can.

554
00:29:57.445 --> 00:29:59.025
So I'm going to trust him for the future.

555
00:30:02.825 --> 00:30:06.365
So meditate on his word. Second, look to Christ's example.

556
00:30:06.955 --> 00:30:08.125
Look to Christ.

557
00:30:08.345 --> 00:30:11.325
One of my favorite verses is Hebrews 12, verse two.

558
00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:15.045
It says, for the joy set

559
00:30:15.185 --> 00:30:19.085
before him, he endured the cross despising the shame

560
00:30:21.955 --> 00:30:22.975
for the joy.

561
00:30:24.235 --> 00:30:27.535
Now, now think about that He endured

562
00:30:29.155 --> 00:30:32.815
beyond our imagination the worst thing possible.

563
00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:36.365
Now we know like, oh, the the nails and the spear

564
00:30:36.425 --> 00:30:38.245
and the crown of thorns like that must've been pretty bad.

565
00:30:38.245 --> 00:30:40.845
We can imagine that this was, you amp it up

566
00:30:40.845 --> 00:30:43.405
with all the spiritual stuff going on on the cross.

567
00:30:43.735 --> 00:30:48.165
Jesus endured immense suffering. Why?

568
00:30:48.275 --> 00:30:52.325
Because he focused on the hope

569
00:30:52.585 --> 00:30:54.405
of glorifying his father

570
00:30:54.905 --> 00:30:56.525
and doing everything necessary

571
00:30:56.525 --> 00:30:58.125
to redeem sinners like you and me.

572
00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:01.765
He went to that extent.

573
00:31:02.025 --> 00:31:05.205
He went through the suffering with joy

574
00:31:05.205 --> 00:31:07.285
because he knew what was coming on the other side.

575
00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.125
He knew his father would be glorified

576
00:31:09.265 --> 00:31:11.725
and he knew that sinners would be saved by doing this.

577
00:31:11.725 --> 00:31:14.565
So he said, I'm doing it. I'm willing. Like I love it.

578
00:31:14.765 --> 00:31:16.565
I love those people enough. I'm gonna do this.

579
00:31:18.275 --> 00:31:21.365
That's joy, right? With joy.

580
00:31:21.425 --> 00:31:22.445
He endured the cross

581
00:31:23.445 --> 00:31:26.085
'cause he knew what was coming on the other side.

582
00:31:26.145 --> 00:31:31.075
So look to Christ like, look to this example of what he did

583
00:31:31.075 --> 00:31:34.155
for us and say, man, I, if he's in me now, I can do that.

584
00:31:34.915 --> 00:31:37.235
I can endure whatever I need to endure

585
00:31:37.235 --> 00:31:39.035
because I know what's coming on the other side.

586
00:31:40.025 --> 00:31:44.895
And it's better than what this is. So meditate on his word.

587
00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:47.615
Look to Christ. Here's a, here's another way

588
00:31:49.435 --> 00:31:51.295
to cultivate this hope, this joy.

589
00:31:51.645 --> 00:31:53.935
It's by fellowshipping with other believers

590
00:31:54.035 --> 00:31:55.655
who share this same hope.

591
00:31:57.875 --> 00:32:02.225
Like this is why church is so important, not legalistic,

592
00:32:02.225 --> 00:32:03.505
that you just have to be here every Sunday.

593
00:32:03.505 --> 00:32:05.705
Check a box. Like no, like I, I had a conversation

594
00:32:05.705 --> 00:32:07.665
with a man before the first service today.

595
00:32:09.295 --> 00:32:13.445
Hadn't seen him in a while. He lost his wife just recently.

596
00:32:15.665 --> 00:32:17.205
And he teared up as I was talking to him.

597
00:32:17.865 --> 00:32:20.935
And you know what I was thinking about this

598
00:32:22.655 --> 00:32:25.875
and I was like, brother, listen, you need me

599
00:32:26.895 --> 00:32:28.515
to carry you right now, don't you?

600
00:32:30.445 --> 00:32:31.785
But then I looked him in the eye and I was like,

601
00:32:31.785 --> 00:32:34.265
there's some day coming that I'm gonna need you to carry me,

602
00:32:36.105 --> 00:32:38.205
to give me a sense of hope that I don't have right now,

603
00:32:38.795 --> 00:32:40.405
that, that I'm doing for you right now

604
00:32:40.405 --> 00:32:41.485
or you're gonna do that for me someday.

605
00:32:43.245 --> 00:32:47.375
That that's what Hebrews 10 explains to us. Watch this.

606
00:32:47.375 --> 00:32:50.055
Hebrews 10, 19 through 25, look at how this,

607
00:32:50.445 --> 00:32:53.255
this draws us into the glory of the gospel.

608
00:32:53.435 --> 00:32:56.015
It says, therefore brothers, since we have confidence

609
00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:59.135
to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new

610
00:32:59.135 --> 00:33:01.535
and living way that he opened for us through the curtain,

611
00:33:01.805 --> 00:33:03.015
that is through his flesh,

612
00:33:03.425 --> 00:33:06.535
since we have a great high priest over the house of God.

613
00:33:06.535 --> 00:33:09.095
Meaning because God has done what he's done

614
00:33:09.095 --> 00:33:10.575
because Jesus did what he did.

615
00:33:10.665 --> 00:33:14.775
Verse 22, let us draw near, near to God

616
00:33:15.205 --> 00:33:17.975
with a true heart in full assurance of faith

617
00:33:18.245 --> 00:33:21.055
with our heart sprinkled clean from an evil conscious,

618
00:33:21.055 --> 00:33:24.895
our bodies washed with pure water like assurance of faith.

619
00:33:25.305 --> 00:33:27.935
God's done when he's done. So I have access to God.

620
00:33:27.995 --> 00:33:31.855
Now, praise that verse 23.

621
00:33:32.115 --> 00:33:36.815
So let us hold fast the confession of our hope

622
00:33:37.325 --> 00:33:38.335
without wavering.

623
00:33:39.645 --> 00:33:42.465
For he who promised is faithful.

624
00:33:43.785 --> 00:33:48.045
We have hope we can hold fast to it because God is faithful.

625
00:33:49.495 --> 00:33:50.835
But then look next 24

626
00:33:51.055 --> 00:33:54.435
and let us consider how to stir up one another

627
00:33:54.435 --> 00:33:55.915
to love and good works.

628
00:33:56.575 --> 00:34:00.275
Not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some,

629
00:34:00.975 --> 00:34:03.355
but encouraging one another

630
00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:07.315
and all the more as you see the day drawing here,

631
00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:14.645
encourage, give courage to one another

632
00:34:15.405 --> 00:34:20.165
whenever it is hard to see a way out, when it's hard

633
00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:23.605
to hold fast to that confession of our hope.

634
00:34:23.605 --> 00:34:25.325
It says give courage. Give courage.

635
00:34:25.435 --> 00:34:26.565
Give courage to each other.

636
00:34:26.985 --> 00:34:28.205
Sit there and have hope

637
00:34:28.225 --> 00:34:29.565
for someone who doesn't have hope right now.

638
00:34:29.595 --> 00:34:32.365
Encourage, lift them up, grab them by the shoulders

639
00:34:32.365 --> 00:34:34.365
and say, come on, I'm gonna pull the rope for you.

640
00:34:34.495 --> 00:34:38.395
Let's go because we're looking forward. Do you see that?

641
00:34:38.445 --> 00:34:41.835
We're looking forward to the day Jesus comes back and,

642
00:34:41.935 --> 00:34:43.635
and all this isn't the way it is anymore.

643
00:34:44.755 --> 00:34:47.245
It's not the way it is right now. It's gonna be different.

644
00:34:47.315 --> 00:34:49.565
It's gonna be future, it's gonna be glory that

645
00:34:50.105 --> 00:34:52.405
all his promises will come to pass fully.

646
00:34:52.425 --> 00:34:53.965
And finally, let's go.

647
00:34:54.115 --> 00:34:57.005
Like let's keep going together towards that.

648
00:34:59.295 --> 00:35:00.755
We need each other.

649
00:35:04.445 --> 00:35:07.025
Listen, if you pursue this meditation on scripture,

650
00:35:07.165 --> 00:35:09.945
if you look to Christ, if you band together the believers,

651
00:35:09.945 --> 00:35:13.025
share the hope, you will mature in your ability

652
00:35:13.045 --> 00:35:14.745
to rejoice in hope.

653
00:35:14.885 --> 00:35:16.985
It will grow in your hearts.

654
00:35:19.645 --> 00:35:23.665
So remember this command to rejoice in hope is grounded,

655
00:35:24.365 --> 00:35:27.625
not in circumstances grounded in the certainty of

656
00:35:27.645 --> 00:35:29.705
who God is, of what He's done and what he will do.

657
00:35:32.105 --> 00:35:36.365
And because of that content are rejoicing, is reasonable,

658
00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:38.325
it's normal, it's expected.

659
00:35:38.395 --> 00:35:39.405
This is what we do

660
00:35:39.475 --> 00:35:42.285
because of what we have coming, what he's done,

661
00:35:42.395 --> 00:35:44.325
what he is doing and what he's going to do.

662
00:35:44.625 --> 00:35:46.645
We should normally rejoice

663
00:35:47.385 --> 00:35:49.965
and pour out our praise to who he is.

664
00:35:49.995 --> 00:35:53.165
That, that, that lifestyle, listen, is not just an emotion,

665
00:35:55.025 --> 00:35:56.205
it is hope and faith.

666
00:35:56.235 --> 00:35:59.765
Married together, steadfastly believing that God will do

667
00:35:59.765 --> 00:36:00.805
what he promised he's gonna do.

668
00:36:01.305 --> 00:36:03.525
That's maturity. No matter

669
00:36:03.595 --> 00:36:06.285
what the world circumstances life looks like,

670
00:36:06.925 --> 00:36:09.645
I know he will do what he said he's gonna do.

671
00:36:10.815 --> 00:36:12.955
That's maturity in Christ.

672
00:36:16.825 --> 00:36:20.725
You remember the scene where Jesus invited Peter

673
00:36:21.025 --> 00:36:22.285
to walk on the water with him?

674
00:36:24.085 --> 00:36:26.255
It's Matthew 14. There's a couple other places it's

675
00:36:26.415 --> 00:36:28.975
recorded, but, but listen, I love that scene

676
00:36:28.975 --> 00:36:30.535
because we already know

677
00:36:30.535 --> 00:36:32.295
that Jesus can walk on the water, right?

678
00:36:32.295 --> 00:36:33.495
Like he's God in the flesh.

679
00:36:33.635 --> 00:36:36.495
So of course waves all this, he's walking on the water.

680
00:36:36.635 --> 00:36:37.735
That's just what God does.

681
00:36:38.885 --> 00:36:43.515
Peter though, that guy, like the one

682
00:36:43.515 --> 00:36:44.995
who stuck his foot in his mouth over to us,

683
00:36:44.995 --> 00:36:46.515
spotted off on all these like cutting

684
00:36:46.515 --> 00:36:47.755
dude's ear off like that guy.

685
00:36:50.345 --> 00:36:53.345
Yeah. Because God empowered him to do it.

686
00:36:53.635 --> 00:36:54.705
Jesus invited him out.

687
00:36:54.705 --> 00:36:56.225
So Peter steps outta the boat

688
00:36:56.485 --> 00:36:59.865
and he's walking on the water just like Jesus, all

689
00:36:59.865 --> 00:37:02.345
because God empowered him to do it for God's glory.

690
00:37:02.445 --> 00:37:03.505
It wasn't anything in Peter,

691
00:37:03.645 --> 00:37:05.025
he had nothing to bring to the table.

692
00:37:05.205 --> 00:37:07.555
He just said, okay. And he walks.

693
00:37:11.425 --> 00:37:12.885
But as Peter stepped outta the boat

694
00:37:15.685 --> 00:37:17.425
as he was walking on the water,

695
00:37:18.215 --> 00:37:19.745
like you can imagine Peter's own mind,

696
00:37:19.745 --> 00:37:21.305
like I'm wa I'm on the water.

697
00:37:21.415 --> 00:37:23.745
Like and other people watching him from the boat like this

698
00:37:23.745 --> 00:37:24.745
is Peter walking like,

699
00:37:25.045 --> 00:37:29.785
but as he was on the water walking, drawing nearer to Jesus,

700
00:37:32.135 --> 00:37:35.965
verse 30 of Matthew 14 says, when Peter

701
00:37:36.665 --> 00:37:39.425
saw the wind, he was afraid.

702
00:37:42.595 --> 00:37:45.685
What that means is he took his eyes off of Jesus

703
00:37:46.845 --> 00:37:48.385
and he started looking at the storm.

704
00:37:52.425 --> 00:37:56.515
What happened then? He began to sink, right?

705
00:37:57.615 --> 00:37:59.635
He needed Jesus to reach down and rescue him.

706
00:38:02.815 --> 00:38:04.395
And I and I read that story and,

707
00:38:04.395 --> 00:38:05.915
and we're all like, man Peter, come on.

708
00:38:05.915 --> 00:38:08.915
You just keep looking at Jesus. Isn't it really easy for us

709
00:38:09.575 --> 00:38:12.595
to take our eyes off of Jesus when the storms

710
00:38:12.595 --> 00:38:17.315
of life crash on us too to, And we look down

711
00:38:17.335 --> 00:38:19.635
and we see the world and we see this storm

712
00:38:19.735 --> 00:38:21.115
and we, we look around

713
00:38:21.175 --> 00:38:23.395
and instead of looking to Jesus, we look at all of this.

714
00:38:23.655 --> 00:38:26.075
But that is the last thing we need to do.

715
00:38:27.135 --> 00:38:28.355
That's the last thing we should

716
00:38:28.355 --> 00:38:29.515
do in the middle of the storm.

717
00:38:29.645 --> 00:38:30.955
We've got to focus harder.

718
00:38:31.125 --> 00:38:35.075
We've gotta look more at Him, more at Jesus instead

719
00:38:35.125 --> 00:38:37.725
of the storm reminding ourselves of what's true, of

720
00:38:37.725 --> 00:38:39.405
what he's given us, of what is certain

721
00:38:39.585 --> 00:38:40.885
of the hope that has succumbed.

722
00:38:40.945 --> 00:38:43.725
We must look at him instead of looking at the world.

723
00:38:43.915 --> 00:38:47.085
That is the essence of the Christian faith.

724
00:38:47.345 --> 00:38:51.325
It is this convinced nature that we are so convinced

725
00:38:51.325 --> 00:38:54.885
of the future grace of God that we can rejoice.

726
00:38:55.345 --> 00:38:59.365
Now, regardless of what present circumstances may say,

727
00:38:59.665 --> 00:39:01.565
may show this is what we can do.

728
00:39:01.585 --> 00:39:03.405
We can rejoice in him

729
00:39:03.595 --> 00:39:06.685
because of what he's going to do, proven by

730
00:39:06.685 --> 00:39:08.125
what he has done.

731
00:39:08.315 --> 00:39:10.925
It's a confidence that acknowledges the pain.

732
00:39:11.265 --> 00:39:15.085
But it says to the pain, you are not ultimately going to win

733
00:39:16.425 --> 00:39:17.555
because of what's coming.

734
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:21.835
Here's the greatest tragedy.

735
00:39:23.335 --> 00:39:25.755
The greatest tragedy is not that our lives are hard.

736
00:39:27.735 --> 00:39:30.195
The greatest tragedy is that Christians act

737
00:39:30.215 --> 00:39:34.435
as if we've forgotten this magnitude of this hope.

738
00:39:36.565 --> 00:39:39.635
Right? You, you see that the greatest tragedy is

739
00:39:39.635 --> 00:39:40.755
not that our lives are hard.

740
00:39:40.895 --> 00:39:43.195
The greatest tragedy is that Christians live

741
00:39:43.295 --> 00:39:45.795
as though we have forgotten the magnitude

742
00:39:45.815 --> 00:39:49.275
of the hope we have in the future, proven by

743
00:39:49.275 --> 00:39:50.995
what He's done in the past, proven by

744
00:39:50.995 --> 00:39:52.035
what he's doing right now.

745
00:39:52.185 --> 00:39:55.475
That we should not forget that we got to be a people

746
00:39:56.055 --> 00:39:59.395
so grounded in the certainty of God's promises.

747
00:39:59.705 --> 00:40:01.395
That the world looks at us

748
00:40:01.775 --> 00:40:04.475
and asks the question, why do you have the hope you have

749
00:40:06.165 --> 00:40:07.255
when the world falls apart?

750
00:40:07.255 --> 00:40:08.455
When your life falls apart,

751
00:40:08.455 --> 00:40:11.855
when everything seems like it's dark and you stand up

752
00:40:11.855 --> 00:40:13.695
and say, I've got hope in the Lord.

753
00:40:13.915 --> 00:40:17.095
He is how I stand. The world looks at it and says, why?

754
00:40:20.435 --> 00:40:23.135
And so let's pray towards that, that joy is not natural.

755
00:40:23.275 --> 00:40:24.895
And so we need to ask God for it right now.

756
00:40:25.035 --> 00:40:29.855
So Lord, we do come to you humbly And we pray that in light

757
00:40:29.855 --> 00:40:34.175
of this joy, this hope, this certainty, Lord, that

758
00:40:34.175 --> 00:40:36.295
that we don't naturally have

759
00:40:36.295 --> 00:40:37.935
that it is a fruit of your spirit.

760
00:40:37.995 --> 00:40:41.495
So God, we need you in your spirit right now to, to

761
00:40:42.275 --> 00:40:46.255
awaken our hearts if needed, to stir our affections for you.

762
00:40:46.255 --> 00:40:47.615
That we would not walk out

763
00:40:47.615 --> 00:40:50.095
of here without a more certain future.

764
00:40:50.285 --> 00:40:52.295
That no matter what we see on the news, no matter

765
00:40:52.295 --> 00:40:54.935
what we see at work, no matter what we feel at school,

766
00:40:55.085 --> 00:40:58.295
that there's a certainty that hope is coming.

767
00:40:58.635 --> 00:41:01.335
You are our hope. We have past, present, future hope.

768
00:41:01.515 --> 00:41:02.815
You are all that we need.

769
00:41:03.075 --> 00:41:07.175
And we have joy today because of all of that.

770
00:41:07.805 --> 00:41:09.015
Lord, remind us of that.

771
00:41:09.365 --> 00:41:13.215
Stir our affections for you, that we would walk in joy,

772
00:41:13.315 --> 00:41:15.295
we would walk in hope, we would walk

773
00:41:15.295 --> 00:41:17.015
with a different cadence,

774
00:41:17.495 --> 00:41:19.655
a different confidence because of who you are.

775
00:41:21.775 --> 00:41:25.965
Thank you, God. Listen, church, if you don't feel that,

776
00:41:26.345 --> 00:41:28.525
let this be sung over you.

777
00:41:30.415 --> 00:41:31.805
Let's remind one another

778
00:41:32.225 --> 00:41:34.085
of this hope we have in Christ if you're able

779
00:41:34.085 --> 00:41:35.525
to stand together and sing.

780
00:41:35.975 --> 00:41:36.725
Enjoy today.
