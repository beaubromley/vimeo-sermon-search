00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.800
Well, good morning again church family. It's been a few weeks. I've missed

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.500
you, but it has been a sweet time

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.700
to watch how God continues his

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.300
work through the word through Phil and Allen. Did

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.100
they do a great job the last couple weeks thankful for them serving that

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.300
way.

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.200
We had a family Camp experience a couple

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.200
weeks ago up in Glorietta. And then last week I

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.200
was with our students as you can see all week. And so it was really fun to

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.600
see what God did through that. And this next

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.700
week is Kids Camp. I'm preaching Kids Camp. So it's his

12
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.400
Camp season for all of us. But today we're gonna continue our series through

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.100
Jesus parables in the Book of Luke where we're seeing

14
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.000
how God is separating things out and today we're going to

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.300
study one of the most well known Parables. It's typically called

16
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.200
the parable of the Prodigal Son.

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.300
As you're going to see though, the parable actually doesn't stand on

18
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.400
its own. There are others that surround it and fill in

19
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.600
some gaps even further.

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.700
We might not be understanding that Parable to its fullest

21
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.400
extent and so we need to really dig deep into

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400
it to understand it.

23
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
Because when we take this whole section all of Luke 15 and it's

24
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.600
context there's main threads going throughout it.

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.400
You'll see it in a moment. But really there's a question God is

26
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
asking us asking them and asking us through the

27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.000
whole thing.

28
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.900
That he is. Joyfully throwing a party are you going to come?

29
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.600
Like that's that's in essence what we're gonna see in Luke 15 a God's

30
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.300
throwing a party full of joy. Are you going to

31
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.700
come?

32
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.100
We'll see how that fills in a lot

33
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.300
of ways today in Luke chapter 15 that thread

34
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
of the party will go throughout Luke

35
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.600
15 take a copy of God's word turn there with me if you're not already there.

36
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.300
Luke 15 as you find it again as we've

37
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.200
done every Parable we need to know the context of what we're

38
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.400
studying here. And so we're gonna start by remembering the

39
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.600
context of why Jesus even says

40
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.100
this Parable in Luke 15

41
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.300
So Luke, 15 verses 1 through 3 to start with set in

42
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.200
the scene for what he says.

43
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.400
It says the tax collectors and sinners were all Drawing Near to

44
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.400
hear Jesus and the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled.

45
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400
Saying this man receives Sinners and eats with

46
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.500
them.

47
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.600
So he told them this parable.

48
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.600
So that again is the entire context in

49
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.900
which Jesus then goes as we'll see next painted

50
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.500
the picture of this parable.

51
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.200
And so what's the context again? The context is that

52
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.500
the Lost were coming and the Pharisees were grumbling.

53
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.700
Pretty straightforward. You see it right there. The the Lost were

54
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.900
coming. Remember when Luke uses the terms tax collectors

55
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.000
and sinner. He's talking about the outcasts all

56
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.300
of those who the religious people avoided because of they are

57
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.700
they were sinful. I'm gonna avoid them. He says tax collectors

58
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.300
and sinners is a catch-all term.

59
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.600
So the loss the Sinners were coming to Jesus, but

60
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.100
the Pharisees were grumbling because of

61
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.100
that they avoided those people.

62
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.800
But Jesus was different, right?

63
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.200
Jesus didn't avoid them. He actually ate meals with them to show them

64
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.000
value.

65
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.800
And that made the Pharisees Furious.

66
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.400
I'm gonna Rabbi so-called rabba. How could he eat with those

67
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.900
kind of people?

68
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.900
And so Jesus told them this parable.

69
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.900
Now notice before we get into the parable verse 3.

70
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.500
There is a singular word there

71
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.300
right? It's the parable.

72
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.900
It seems like as we go through it, there might be even four parables

73
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.400
in this but I think it's it's all one Parable. Jesus

74
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.700
doesn't transition between the scenes very much. It

75
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.100
just kind of tells the parable.

76
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.300
It has different sections giving different angles on

77
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.200
what he's trying to teach us and so as we look through it, you're gonna see

78
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.500
what do we learn from this Parable? We saw the context now,

79
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.200
what do we learn from? What Jesus is trying

80
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.100
to teach them what he's trying to teach us? What do we learn here?

81
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.600
Well first we learn from his stories about

82
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.000
the sheep and the coin that's the first two scenes

83
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.800
kind of put together. Look at Verses 4 through

84
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.200
10.

85
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.400
He begins his parable.

86
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.200
Saying what man of you having a hundred sheep if he's lost one of

87
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.200
them does not leave the 99 in the Open Country go after the one

88
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.100
that is lost until he finds it.

89
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.500
And when he's found it, he lays on his shoulders rejoicing.

90
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.100
When he comes home, he calls together his friends his neighbors saying to them

91
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.100
Rejoice with me. I found my sheep. That was lost.

92
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.000
Just so I tell you there will be more joy in heaven over

93
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.500
one sinner who repents then over 99

94
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.600
righteous persons who need no repentance.

95
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.400
Or what woman having 10 silver coins? If she loses one coin

96
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.400
does not light a lamp sweep the house seek diligently until

97
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.100
she finds it.

98
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.800
And when she's found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors saying Rejoice

99
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.600
with me. I found the coin that I lost.

100
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.300
Just so I tell you there's joy before the angels of God over one

101
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.800
sinner who repents?

102
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.100
Similar scenes right now instead of trying to

103
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.100
pick apart every detail of these two similar stories. We need

104
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.900
to remember Jesus's Point here.

105
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.200
What's he trying to say? Because remember the religious leaders were

106
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.700
grumbling against him as we told them these words. What

107
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.700
was he trying to teach them?

108
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.000
Well first like we remember the sword method made a couple weeks ago. First question

109
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.700
we asked is was he trying to teach about God?

110
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.900
What does this teach us about God here?

111
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.600
Just these couples Verses first. The lesson we

112
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.200
learn about God is that he diligently seeks the Lost.

113
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.700
It's pretty clear, right? He's seeking the

114
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.400
Lost.

115
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.300
Which is in fact, if you remember the thesis of the entire Book of

116
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.400
Luke is Luke 19:10, Jesus himself saying this

117
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.700
is my purpose in coming Luke 19:10.

118
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.900
He says the son of man came to seek

119
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.300
and to save the Lost.

120
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.400
That's his whole point in coming which actually is

121
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.700
a fulfillment of Prophecy all the way back from Ezekiel 34

122
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.600
a few hundred years earlier.

123
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.500
Says I will seek the laws. This is God talking. I

124
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.800
will seek the lost. I will bring back the straight. I'll

125
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.800
bring bind up the injured. I will strengthen the

126
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.400
weak.

127
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.500
Jesus is simply fulfilling prophecy saying

128
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.900
I came for the Lost.

129
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.300
And that's what the parable shows right?

130
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.100
Obvious, it's not that complicated that God's heart is to

131
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.500
seek and save the Lost those far from God not those

132
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.000
who think I'm good with God.

133
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.200
Because that's what he means in verse 7 if you notice what he said he seems

134
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.900
to say that 99 people don't need repentance.

135
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.300
Now he's not saying that those people are perfect that they don't need

136
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.400
God in some way. They're gonna make it on their own. No, it's what

137
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.700
he said just a few chapters earlier back in Luke 5 a

138
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.700
similar situation. He's facing with these Pharisees.

139
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.300
They were grumbling at his disciples saying why do

140
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.900
you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners almost the same thing?

141
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.700
Here's what Jesus said back then he said those who are well have

142
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.600
no need of a physician, but those who are sick.

143
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.000
I have not come to call the righteous but Sinners to

144
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.300
repentance.

145
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.200
Seems again confusing and Jesus saying you don't need

146
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.400
repentance. If you're perfect if you're good enough. No, he means that

147
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.200
he did not come for those who assume that they're

148
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.700
good enough.

149
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.200
For those who?

150
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.600
Who think I've got it all together. I'm okay. No,

151
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.800
he came for those who know that they are sick

152
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.400
spiritually.

153
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.300
Who know that they do need a savior? That's that's the idea

154
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.000
you go to the doctor because you know, you're sick.

155
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.600
I know I got a problem. Can you fix it?

156
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.200
physician he

157
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.900
Can't so that's God's heart for the Lost, aren't we? So thankful for that.

158
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.400
If we really knowledge and recognize our sin, we know

159
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.800
we have a physician a doctor to heal

160
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.100
us.

161
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.000
So we see God's heart here. But even further did you

162
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.300
notice as I was reading through Luke 15. Did you notice how many times the

163
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.800
word Joy showed up?

164
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.400
in seven verses right here shows up five times

165
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.400
It's the Greek word Cara which means gladness.

166
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.700
And it's used in Joy, but also in rejoicing those are very similar

167
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.700
words, but that Roots the same and and that word Cara means

168
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.100
both the happy gladness emotion

169
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.900
you feel on the inside when you're joyful.

170
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.300
But also the action externally you do when you're

171
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:40.900
joyful.

172
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.300
So with joy and rejoicing both inside you

173
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.800
saw that with the shepherd and the woman, right? They felt Joy, but

174
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.700
then what their friends too, they threw a big party together because

175
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.700
they were Overjoyed they found what was lost Jesus says

176
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.200
that's what's happening in heaven when a sinner

177
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.600
repents.

178
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.500
Like we don't think that way very often right that God is

179
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.800
throwing a party.

180
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.900
When someone turns and believes like this week, it can't God through

181
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.300
a couple parties in heaven because of what happened.

182
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.400
It's a picture of God that we're learning about him that he's full

183
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.200
of joy over the Lost being found.

184
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.800
So the first question is we learn things about God.

185
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.400
But the second question of the sword method is that we learn things about

186
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.000
us in response. And so

187
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.300
we learn things here in this section about us a couple brief things here.

188
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.200
Clearly first if we want to enter God's game if we want to get in

189
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.900
the party.

190
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.500
The way in is that we must repent of our

191
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:44.900
sin.

192
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.200
It's obvious. It's clear the way in to the

193
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.000
party is repentance.

194
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.200
He's talking about lost people here. And he says the way

195
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.400
they are found is through repentance.

196
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.800
It's like Isaiah 53 says that we are like

197
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.700
sheep each one of us have gone astray.

198
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.400
Turn to our own way.

199
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.600
And then it goes through and it talks about the suffering servant about Jesus a prophecy

200
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.900
of him in essence saying that because of jesus' Life

201
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.700
Death and Resurrection in our place.

202
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.400
When we turn from our sin and turn to him as our

203
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.300
savior, then we are saved.

204
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.100
We recognize we are sheep that have gone astray and

205
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.100
we need him we are found.

206
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.600
As we turn away and turn to him.

207
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.700
And so we we know we enter through repentance, but

208
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.200
also that should lead us to celebrate too, right?

209
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.100
Like this Kingdom has come.

210
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.300
And if we've been graciously included in the kingdom of God when

211
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.300
we don't deserve it, we're far from God. We're running away from him

212
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.400
and he's included us into it. Should that not bring joy?

213
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.600
Like should that not mean we celebrate like

214
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.500
heaven does in response to Salvation.

215
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.600
Just think about

216
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.700
when you hear of someone.

217
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.500
Turning from their sin and trusting in Christ. When you see someone baptized in

218
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.100
response to that when you hear someone's life change. Does

219
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.900
that stir your heart at all?

220
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.500
It should.

221
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.600
God's up there throwing a party.

222
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.800
It should stir us even deeper.

223
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.800
Do you rejoice over God's work in your life?

224
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.500
Do you see joy in response to what he

225
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.500
has done? I mean, this is Life Giving hope that's

226
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.700
one of our values that that should create an atmosphere of

227
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.800
Joy because of the Gospel.

228
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.400
Grace should saturate us because of

229
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.600
the Gospel change that we've been brought into

230
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.100
and that means we should then explode with

231
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.300
praise with worship with Declarations of

232
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.800
our faith. Right? Why should we be upset seemingly

233
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.600
about this?

234
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.000
Sad about our Salvation. This should lead to overwhelming

235
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.900
Joy celebration. Like what

236
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.400
Jesus says is happening in heaven.

237
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.600
Which should also then lead us to imitate God and go after the lost as well.

238
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.300
If this is God's heart.

239
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.500
To seek and save the Lost we should

240
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.200
join him in that effort.

241
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.500
Now their salvation is up to God. That's I can't save

242
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.100
them that's up to him. But he

243
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.800
has chosen to use us as partners in the process.

244
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.900
And so we get to go we get to share.

245
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.200
As an opportunity to participate in his mission. It

246
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.500
is a good grace.

247
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.300
That we get to go.

248
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.000
Now Jesus was not finished yet in Luke 15.

249
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.900
We've just seen seven verses.

250
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.300
And really all we've seen so far

251
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.400
has been setting us up for the next passage, which

252
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.600
is probably the most popular story Jesus ever told commonly again

253
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.800
known as the parable The Prodigal Son.

254
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.300
But here's what we need to be careful about whenever we

255
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.300
start titling things or even the headings in

256
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.600
your Bible that were not originally in the scripture. These

257
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.300
were added for clarity and to help us understand

258
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.400
things. But but anytime we add a title it starts

259
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.600
to direct our interpretation of it.

260
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.200
And so when we hear the parable of the Prodigal Son our first

261
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.800
thought goes to that. This is about the one

262
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.200
son.

263
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.700
But there's actually a Twist in this.

264
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.400
There's a Twist that will see when we read the whole

265
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:43.800
thing.

266
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.300
And we'll get to it in a little bit, but we can learn

267
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.400
first from the younger son. So don't think this isn't about the sun. It

268
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.600
is partially about the Sun but we need to learn from him. And

269
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.500
this is the part of this section here versus 11

270
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.900
through 24 about the younger son primarily.

271
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.600
So notice Jesus continues his parable.

272
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.700
And he said there was a man who had two sons.

273
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.600
And the younger of them said to his father father give me the share of properties coming

274
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.600
to me. Give me my inheritance basically.

275
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.200
And he divided his property between them the two sons.

276
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.100
Not many days later the younger son gathered all that he had

277
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.600
and took a journey into a far country and there he squandered

278
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.100
his property in Reckless living.

279
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.400
And when he had spent everything a severe famine arose in

280
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.100
that country, he began to be a need.

281
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.200
So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of

282
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.800
the country who sent him into his fields to feed pigs, and he

283
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.200
was longing to be fed with the PODS of the pigs ate and

284
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.400
no one gave him anything. You see just this continual degradation.

285
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:46.900
in his life

286
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.700
verse 17

287
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.600
but when he came to himself

288
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.500
He said how many of my father's hired servants have

289
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.500
more than enough bread.

290
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.300
But I perish here with hunger.

291
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.300
I'll arise and go to my father and I will say to him

292
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.700
father. I've sinned against heaven. And before you I am

293
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.000
no longer worthy to be called your son.

294
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.900
Treat me as one of your hired servants.

295
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.000
And he arose and came to his father.

296
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.500
But while he was still a long way off.

297
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.800
His father saw him and felt compassion and ran

298
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.600
and embraced him and kissed him and the

299
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.400
son said to him father. I've sinned against you

300
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.100
heaven. And before you I'm no longer worthy to be

301
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.300
called your son, but the father said to

302
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.200
his servants bring quickly the best robe put

303
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.300
it on him put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring the

304
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.100
fat and calf and kill it. Let us eat and celebrate for

305
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.400
my son was dead and is

306
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.300
alive again he was lost and is found and they

307
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.000
began to celebrate.

308
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.400
You see the similarities already right the first two sections. This

309
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.100
one looks very similar much more detailed. But you hear a lot

310
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.200
of the same thing something cherished was lost and then

311
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.100
it was found.

312
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.400
And again, we could get all hung up on the details how all this works out everything

313
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.100
like that, but don't miss what Jesus was trying to

314
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.500
teach in the context that he was talking.

315
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.200
Again, what was he teaching about god? Let's like that first. What was he

316
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.800
teaching about God through this account of the younger son. We've added

317
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.300
on what we've already learned. Now this

318
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.300
this sections pointing us to God as

319
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.000
our gracious and loving father.

320
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.200
That's the father. He's a picture of who God is

321
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.400
here. And what does he do first? He provides with abundance.

322
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.900
This good gracious father is a provider with

323
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.200
abundance, right? He says the young man

324
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.800
wakes up and he says

325
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.400
and everybody in my father's house has more

326
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:57.900
than enough.

327
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.800
And I'm sitting here trying to eat pig food. Like they

328
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.000
have more than enough. My father has everything that I

329
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.200
need.

330
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.700
Set not a picture of our heavenly father.

331
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.400
Who owns the cattle on a thousand hills who is Sovereign

332
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.000
over all creation? He is more than enough for you.

333
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.600
He will always give us what we need. Maybe not what we want, but what we need.

334
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.400
He's a good father.

335
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.200
He provides with abundance.

336
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.200
Yet this son.

337
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.600
for whatever reason

338
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.000
he looked at his dad and he said you're dead to

339
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.200
me.

340
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.400
Essentially, that's what he was doing when he was asking for his part

341
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.300
of the Heritage earlier, which would have been a third. The oldest son would've

342
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.200
got a double portion. So he would have got a third of the estate when his dad

343
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.500
died. He says give it to me now.

344
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.200
I don't care if you're alive or dead basically.

345
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.600
And so that that was disrespectful enough,

346
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:56.800
right?

347
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.400
But then even further this young man takes all that

348
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.300
he had probably sold it all got the money and then

349
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.200
went away and wasted it all.

350
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.200
an additional slap in his father's face

351
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.500
think how far this young man has gone.

352
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:21.900
But what happens?

353
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.600
When the sun turned to come back home.

354
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.400
Verse 20 shows us the father

355
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.900
responds with compassion.

356
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.000
again, this is teaching us about

357
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.900
Who our father is?

358
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.000
his heart

359
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.100
The Father Here responds with compassion that's a word

360
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.900
in the original language. That means empathy.

361
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.400
That he felt what his son was feeling took

362
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.700
it upon himself and notice

363
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.500
what he didn't do.

364
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.700
The sun comes up the path. He runs to him. The father didn't chastise the

365
00:18:59.700 --> 00:18:59.800
son.

366
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.200
The father didn't jump his case for

367
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.100
wasting all that money.

368
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.900
He didn't jump all over him for for living in that sinful lifestyle

369
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.100
that he was doing. No. He looked at

370
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.600
his son. And he said this is my beloved child.

371
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.800
And he Embraces him and he kisses him but notice it wasn't just

372
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.400
that.

373
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.400
Right this this is a picture of the love God

374
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.200
has for his people that we go and make

375
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.400
a mess of Our Lives yet when we come home see what

376
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.300
happens. He Embraces. He kisses he redeems

377
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.100
back into the family, which is a word. That

378
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.600
means seat back at the table.

379
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.200
He puts the robe the ring the shoes which by

380
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.100
the way would have Illustrated. He's not a slave. He's not a Hired Hand

381
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.200
because they would have been Barefoot. He has shoes on which means you're a part

382
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.000
of the family son.

383
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.800
You took off you ran away you wasted it, but you're a

384
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.100
part of my family.

385
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.400
He embraced it all of that. You can think of the love

386
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.100
that son was feeling in that moment, but then not only that.

387
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.200
What do you do he threw a party?

388
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.100
Same as the shepherd same as

389
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.900
the woman he threw a party the Father Here celebrates

390
00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.800
with life.

391
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.200
Both the emotion the joy that

392
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.400
he felt inside he expressed outwardly. Let's throw a party.

393
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.300
He's celebrated with life in that but also think about this

394
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.300
what he says in verse 24 this my son

395
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.200
was dead.

396
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.700
In essence was dead and is alive again this

397
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.000
father is throwing a resurrection

398
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.500
party.

399
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.200
That his son was effectively dead he'd gone

400
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.600
and now he is alive here in

401
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.400
the flesh. What Joy think of the joy they

402
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.300
had when Lazarus walked out of that tomb right think of the joy the disciples

403
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.600
had when Jesus was out of that tomb right? That's the same kind

404
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.500
of idea. He's like, my son is alive. I cherish

405
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.400
child is back.

406
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.900
That's what happens in heaven.

407
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.200
and I think think of it when

408
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.300
When a sinner repents he says when when a sinner

409
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.200
comes from Death To Life spiritually.

410
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.600
It's a resurrection party in heaven.

411
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.800
so we get this deeper and deeper heart picture of

412
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.900
who God is

413
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.700
We learn about him but that again teaches us about ourselves then

414
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:31.900
right?

415
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.100
We learn things about us from this same passage that

416
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.500
we see the grace of God. We see the love

417
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.600
of the father. But then what do we learn about us?

418
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.300
Well, we can easily forget our identity just as

419
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.400
much as the younger son.

420
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.400
We can forget our identity too, right you see this here with this

421
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.000
young man when he when he responds the way

422
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.500
he does when he comes to the end of himself in the far country. He

423
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.500
thought back and he remembered how his father would

424
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.800
always provide enough for him.

425
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.600
I was a son. I'm a son. Why would my father forsake me?

426
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600
I I have

427
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.300
I have everything I need for my good father. Why would

428
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.400
I run away? Why would I not need but

429
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.500
But he also remembers how he was supposed to reflect his

430
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.500
father's values.

431
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.600
And he failed at that and so he forgot who

432
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.500
he was.

433
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.900
How often we do the same thing, right?

434
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.500
We forget that God's created us to be his image bearers.

435
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.700
To mirror him to the world. We forget that

436
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.600
he has created us to be an intimate relationship with

437
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.400
him that that's our primary sweet spot

438
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.200
of life is to be in relationship with God and

439
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.600
so we try to find our identity and everything else.

440
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.100
And sinful living in what people

441
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.600
think about us and we we try to find identity all over

442
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.600
those places and we forget what our father says

443
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.100
about us.

444
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.800
We end up in the far country looking for identity and it never comes

445
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.900
through we forget what our father says.

446
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.000
We've all been there.

447
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.300
but remember

448
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.500
there's good news here at the same time.

449
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.400
See when you see your past is too dirty.

450
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.600
Right. Now you might be feeling that that you have gone too

451
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.300
far that you're drifting away from the father and you're in that far

452
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.300
country and you have gone too far. You might feel that

453
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.100
right now hear me you can always return in humility.

454
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.400
That's the picture right the younger son. You can always return this

455
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.000
young man. He lost everything he hit rock bottom.

456
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.400
He had to feed pigs. Remember for the

457
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.900
Jews pigs were unclean

458
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.500
and he's not only feeding them kind of laying down

459
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.600
with him. He's one to eat what they're wanting to eat.

460
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.500
He is as far gone from his

461
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.100
identity as you can get.

462
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.500
But the text says he came to himself.

463
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.200
That's a phrase. That means he kind of woke up.

464
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.800
He he had a true picture of himself

465
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.700
a true picture of his situation.

466
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.900
Had experience like this a couple weeks ago when we were on our family Camp

467
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.600
trip. We went white water rafting.

468
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.100
And our guide his name was Drew and we're just talking you're on the boat for two

469
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.500
hours with them. You can talk about everything.

470
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.100
And through the course of the time we got to the kind of talk about his life and

471
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.200
he used almost that exact phrase.

472
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.100
As he was just feeling comfortable he opened up and talked about

473
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.200
how he came to the end of himself.

474
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.100
And just had to give up so he moved to the mountains didn't know where he's

475
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.800
going for. And so what it gave me the opportunity to do was

476
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.600
just talk about how I had to as well.

477
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.800
I had to come to myself and I had to run home to Jesus. I had

478
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.300
to come home. I had to see him as better. I had to

479
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.100
come home. I don't know if Drew trusted Christ or not. I don't know where

480
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.600
he is. I gave him my phone number. We'll see if he calls but let's see.

481
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.000
See what God is doing here.

482
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.300
He is getting us to the end of ourselves.

483
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.200
Just like this younger son. We have to get there, but think about what

484
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.400
the younger son woke up to.

485
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.600
He came to the end of himself, but what did he see? He felt unworthy.

486
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.500
He felt humiliated he assumed if I go home, I'm gonna

487
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.500
have to give up my status as a son. I wasted his money. I spit

488
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.600
in his face all of that.

489
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.400
And so he's on the way home. He's practicing this speech. You know,

490
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.300
he's got it in his head. Yeah before he can even get the

491
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.000
whole speech out. Did you see that?

492
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.400
He said a couple of the pieces but

493
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.400
then as soon as his father heard a repentant heart. He

494
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.300
said you're forgiven.

495
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.200
The son assumed I'm not going to be able to be a son

496
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.000
anymore and the father said come on in son.

497
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.100
Same thing God does with us friends. Listen, you are not too

498
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.700
far gone.

499
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.500
You have not sinned too much. It's not too late. You

500
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.800
can always return in humility God

501
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.700
your father is looking down that long road. He's watching

502
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.700
for you to come to the end of yourself and he's

503
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.400
wanting you to turn back to him for you

504
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.500
to humbly admit. You were wrong that you sinned against

505
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.200
him. Yes. He knows you did it. So admit it

506
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.300
and then he wants to say to you my arms are

507
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.700
open wide for you to return to me.

508
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.400
Come home.

509
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.700
Your father is joyfully throwing a party

510
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.400
are you going to come?

511
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.700
It's for Sinners Like You and Me.

512
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.200
Now we could stop there.

513
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:03.800
And be great.

514
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.600
like that's what a lot of sermons do at that point is

515
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.300
Is God welcomes and transforms Sinners? Let's

516
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.400
let's play Just As I Am, let's have a great time. Let's respond all

517
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.300
of that. Absolutely.

518
00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:18.800
But do you remember?

519
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.400
how Jesus began this section in

520
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:22.800
verse 11

521
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.900
And he said there was a man who had two

522
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.100
sons.

523
00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.600
See there's a second son in this Parable. And actually this

524
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.700
son is jesus' primary point.

525
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.600
Of this whole parable.

526
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.400
I know we identify with the younger son in many ways rightly, right?

527
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.300
We we need that picture and it's absolutely true.

528
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.900
But think again about the context.

529
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.400
These Pharisees were grumbling about Jesus

530
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.300
spending time with Sinners. And so he told

531
00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.300
them this Parable with this last section as the

532
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:04.700
punch.

533
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.100
All of it's been preparing for this section dealing

534
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.600
with the older son.

535
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.600
Look at it in verses 25 through 32.

536
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.600
Now his older son was in the field.

537
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.400
And as he came and Drew near to the house, he heard music

538
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.300
and dancing. That was the party that the father was throwing for

539
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.200
the younger son verse 26. He called one of the servants and asked what

540
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.000
these things meant.

541
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.700
And he said to him. Your brother has come your father's

542
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.400
killed the fat and calf because he received him back safe

543
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.300
and sound.

544
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.100
But he was angry.

545
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.000
refused to go in

546
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.400
his father came out and treated him

547
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400
pleaded with him.

548
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.100
But he answered his father look.

549
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.500
He goes here the sarcasm look these many years I've served

550
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:01.700
you.

551
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.300
I never disobeyed your command yet. You never gave me

552
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.700
a young goat that I might celebrate with my friends.

553
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.100
But when this son of yours not my

554
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.200
brother when this son of yours came who has

555
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.400
devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fat and calf

556
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:17.600
for him.

557
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.300
the father said to him

558
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.800
Son, you're always with me.

559
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.200
All that is mine is yours.

560
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.600
It was fitting right to celebrate and

561
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.400
be glad for you. This your brother.

562
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.300
Was dead and is alive.

563
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.100
He was lost.

564
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.100
his found

565
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.400
now you see the structure again is pretty similar. All four

566
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.800
of these scenes were highlighting the

567
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.500
celebration of finding what was lost life out

568
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.400
of death all of that.

569
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.300
But there's a huge difference, right?

570
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:02.200
The older son had a very different perspective on

571
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.100
this whole ordeal.

572
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.400
again, remember the context

573
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.700
Jesus is telling this sin.

574
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.700
You see where we're going with this, right?

575
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.300
And so again, we need to learn things about God from this section. We learn things

576
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.400
about our father first that we we see

577
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.200
his kingdom is very expansive.

578
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.000
We learn from this section God's kingdom is expansive and here's what I

579
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:28.400
mean by that.

580
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.700
See, we cherish that picture where the undignified

581
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.700
father is running down the road to embrace his

582
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.300
younger son as he humbly returned. But

583
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.400
when that we see God's heart for the Lost, we we love

584
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.100
that picture. We embrace it. Yes.

585
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.200
Don't miss this.

586
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.300
Don't miss that. The father also came out and

587
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.800
entreated the older son.

588
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.200
You see that?

589
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:56.700
see

590
00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.400
this older son out here throwing a pity party like

591
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.100
throwing a tantrum. The father could have just left him out there.

592
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.100
Forget you man. Come on.

593
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.000
No, he didn't.

594
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:11.600
What did he do?

595
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.300
Because he loved his older son. Just as much.

596
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.800
Despite the older son's sin

597
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.500
that looked a little bit different than the younger son sin. It

598
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.200
was still in essence sin slapping the

599
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.400
face of the father. He says, I love you enough. I'm

600
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.600
coming out for you, too.

601
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.400
That's what Jesus is doing here with the Pharisees. He's showing

602
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.300
them the gods kingdom is expansive God's kingdom

603
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.600
includes both religious people and irreligious people.

604
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.400
It means that just like the tax collectors and sinners

605
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.700
had received Jesus Compassionate Care. He's

606
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.600
saying hey Pharisees. It's open for you, too.

607
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.600
If you have eyes and ears to hear and see right you could

608
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.600
get in the party too if you humble yourself.

609
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.700
with a repentant attitude

610
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.300
you're welcome in the

611
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.700
Park which again shows us this love is reaching.

612
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.400
Kingdom is expansive. It's all kinds of people. It's love

613
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.200
is reaching it's going right. He left the house

614
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.200
to go to the younger son who was coming down

615
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.400
the road. He left the house to go to the older son to say.

616
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.400
Hey, come on in.

617
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.000
His love is reaching it's going all kinds of

618
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.300
people all kinds of backgrounds all kinds of sin struggles. Even when

619
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.500
that sin struggle is self-righteousness.

620
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.600
and judgmentalism

621
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:49.600
He's saying.

622
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.000
repent

623
00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.700
Come into the party.

624
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.900
That's the same way in for both sons.

625
00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.600
humility repentance

626
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.800
So we learn again about God about his kingdom about his heart. We see

627
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.400
it, but I want to focus in as we head towards

628
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.000
closing today. I want to focus in on what God is teaching us about us in

629
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.500
this section.

630
00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.500
Because again, this is the punchline, right? This is the this is

631
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.600
where Jesus was heading the whole time.

632
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.300
And he implies a couple piercing questions that we need all of

633
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.100
us to answer.

634
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.500
First question we would see here is as you

635
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.700
imagine those hearers starting to feel

636
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.400
this question come up for us as well the first

637
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:38.700
question.

638
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.100
How will we respond to others?

639
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.600
How will we respond to others?

640
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.600
Because in essence what Jesus is doing here is he's saying

641
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.100
to the Pharisees I came to love those Sinners

642
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.100
because you didn't.

643
00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.300
Because you aren't.

644
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.500
Here's what I mean. You remember the story of Israel all the

645
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.500
way back from Abraham.

646
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.700
Is that God set apart that Nation to

647
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.500
be vessels of blessing to All

648
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:13.900
Nations?

649
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.400
To love the lost to to show God off

650
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.400
to those around them and yet what the story shows

651
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.700
us is that they progressively pulled away

652
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.100
from those people.

653
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.400
They progressively jerked away from others to

654
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.600
separate themselves from the nations from the laws.

655
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.500
Instead of fulfilling their identity as a vessel

656
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.500
of Mercy. Listen, we have a similar call today. If

657
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.500
we asynchrony these five says are is ambassadors of

658
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.900
reconciliation. If God has set us apart Christians

659
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.300
set us apart Church to be

660
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.500
his ambassadors. We are not to pull away

661
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.400
and stay in our holy huddles.

662
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.500
We are to live scent to go to

663
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.300
them to reach with his love

664
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.700
that reached us. We can reach with his Mercy as

665
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:06.700
well.

666
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.600
And so will we spend time with people far from

667
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:12.700
God?

668
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.000
Will be care for them will we show them the image of

669
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.900
God as we are created to do as vessels of Mercy blessing

670
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.600
to others. Will we do that like Jesus did

671
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.200
or

672
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.300
will we sit back and self-righteous judgment?

673
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.000
Demanding that they get their lives together before coming in.

674
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:43.300
See the kingdom values Jesus was proclaiming here demand

675
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.200
a shift in our perspective toward

676
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.300
those who are far from God.

677
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.300
Like the older son.

678
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.100
sat back and said

679
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.000
you love that guy.

680
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.300
Because that's the second question.

681
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.700
I think it's a little more even cutting deeply in

682
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.800
our souls not only how we respond to others. How will

683
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.300
we respond to the father?

684
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.800
How will we respond when the father?

685
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:16.800
asks us

686
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.000
these questions

687
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.200
See, that's the twist in this Parable right? You saw it?

688
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.400
That probably most of us should identify with the older son here.

689
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.200
Yes, we identify with a younger son. Of course we

690
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.200
do and we should that's true. But for most of us,

691
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.300
we think we're doing okay.

692
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.500
We think the way that we serve God is sufficient. We

693
00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.300
think that we obey most of God's commands. And so God you

694
00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.600
we deserve something from you. We deserve you

695
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.200
to bless us and to give us good things and

696
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.300
and to make our lives easy and we start to think inherently in

697
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.300
that this older brother syndrome that those who live in

698
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.400
blatant sin those people out there. They don't deserve God's

699
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:00.600
love.

700
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.000
They've gone too far. How could you ever love them?

701
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.700
You should love me.

702
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.600
You should bless me.

703
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.500
Is that you today?

704
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:18.900
Is that your

705
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.300
Heart attitude and the way you feel at times even ever

706
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.400
say it out loud, but do you feel that?

707
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.200
See God is showing us this.

708
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.400
True nature. It's forgiving is loving heart.

709
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.600
How will we respond to him?

710
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.000
See if you notice.

711
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.000
Jesus intentionally left this Parable open-ended

712
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.900
We don't know how the older brother responded.

713
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.500
Men, praise God if he came in the house.

714
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.200
What the travesty?

715
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.300
If you would have stayed outside.

716
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.200
What that should do for us what it did for the Pharisees as

717
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:11.800
they hear this.

718
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.100
What it should do for us is it should?

719
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.000
It should cause us to check our hearts allow God

720
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.500
to search our hearts and to dig out

721
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.200
those roots that we might deny or there

722
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.400
the things that we might not see at the at the face

723
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.900
of everything. Do do we have this kind of attitude. Do

724
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.800
we see God's love and compassion as something

725
00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.300
unworthy for them, but worthy for me. Do we

726
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.500
have that in us at all?

727
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.700
Because listen God our Father.

728
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.000
Is inviting you into the party.

729
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.600
A party that's full of joy and gladness and

730
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.600
eternal feasting because the Lost

731
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.600
are found because Sinners are saved. Will

732
00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.000
you be there?

733
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.100
Whether you're the older son or the younger son in this Parable

734
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.400
the father is coming out of the

735
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.100
house, and he's inviting you in to the party.
