1
00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:02.925
You can have a seat.

2
00:00:02.945 --> 00:00:05.845
Church, good morning again, it is great

3
00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:07.205
to see you this morning.

4
00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:10.405
My name is John. I'm, uh, the lead teaching pastor here,

5
00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:11.845
which means I preach most of the time,

6
00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.045
but I am not preaching today

7
00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:16.765
because we have a special guest with us, uh,

8
00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:20.405
a man who's made a, a huge impact on my life over the years

9
00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:23.365
and I'm super thankful to have him here with us today.

10
00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:26.205
This is Dr. Richard Ross. Don't you come ahead for this way.

11
00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:30.845
Um, so when Emily

12
00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:33.965
and I moved to Fort Worth for seminary, I had known

13
00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:35.365
of Dr. Ross before

14
00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:38.525
and found out where he was going to church

15
00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:40.045
and said, that's where we're going to church.

16
00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:43.565
That's all I knew. And it was because of his heart

17
00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.125
and love for Jesus.

18
00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:46.325
And you'll hear that today

19
00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:51.205
and impacting me in such ways that has marked me from

20
00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:54.525
that time forward for a deep love, for just

21
00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:56.165
how great our God is

22
00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:59.165
and to give everything to him in response.

23
00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:00.525
You'll hear that and see that

24
00:01:01.345 --> 00:01:04.205
and uh, so he will share about his

25
00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:05.605
experience with the Lord as well.

26
00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:07.365
But I wanna pray for him before we get going.

27
00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:10.805
Lord, thank you so much for this man who's, who's meant

28
00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.165
so much to so many who's spent

29
00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:15.325
decades teaching in the seminary.

30
00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.805
But, but Lord, I know his heart is to declare your glory

31
00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:23.965
and the supremacy of Jesus over everything.

32
00:01:25.345 --> 00:01:27.405
So Lord, fill him with your spirit now.

33
00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:30.205
Fill us with your spirit to hear what you want us

34
00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:31.525
to hear today and be impacted

35
00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.525
and challenged in the ways you want us to be changed today.

36
00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:36.165
That we can't walk away from this

37
00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:39.005
just the same way we walked in, uh,

38
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:42.365
that you would meet us in that time of need that we all have

39
00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:44.685
for your glory, for our good.

40
00:01:45.135 --> 00:01:47.605
Speak through him today. In Jesus' name, amen.

41
00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:54.125
For us to have sweeping revival in the United States.

42
00:01:54.345 --> 00:01:56.125
God can do that any way he wants to,

43
00:01:56.705 --> 00:02:00.285
but wouldn't it be wonderful if by the multiplication

44
00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:04.085
of pastors like Pastor John who have a heart for Jesus?

45
00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:07.125
What if they were filling pulpits all across the land?

46
00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:11.405
It would be a wonderful thing, thrilled to be here

47
00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:13.965
where this precious man of God is ministering.

48
00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:17.685
But there's actually a personal reason why I'm really

49
00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:18.965
glad to be here today.

50
00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:23.165
Uh, only if I get an official speaking invitation,

51
00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:27.085
do I get a pass to leave the Happy Hills nursing home?

52
00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:31.165
You guys are my excuse this morning.

53
00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:34.645
I got to have a breakfast taco instead of that little bottle

54
00:02:34.665 --> 00:02:36.805
of insurer, which is what they usually give me.

55
00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:41.405
Nobody will be checking my diapers today. This is all good.

56
00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:46.565
In fact, I'm gonna have to be a little bit honest with you.

57
00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:48.925
I, I have been a lifetime youth leader

58
00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:51.205
and even at my age, I know it's ridiculous,

59
00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:53.045
but it, even at my age, I'm still speaking

60
00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:54.965
to teenagers, I can't believe it.

61
00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:58.085
Uh, but just a while back my age

62
00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.085
actually became an emotional issue to me.

63
00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:05.445
I was gonna speak for a citywide disciple now a lot

64
00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:08.245
of youth pastors, a lot of youth groups, and I knew the band

65
00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:10.325
and the band was gonna be hip and cool

66
00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:13.805
and I thought, okay, the teenagers are rocking with the band

67
00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:14.925
and then I walk out.

68
00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:16.725
Now that's gonna be ridiculous.

69
00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:20.605
So the day before disciple that weekend, I went

70
00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:22.045
to Hulen Mall near my house,

71
00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:24.485
I bought my first pair of skinny jeans.

72
00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:28.605
I thought, okay, I can't change my face,

73
00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:30.125
but if I could walk on platform

74
00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:32.325
and skinny jeans, maybe it won't be quite so bad.

75
00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:35.005
Well, they did give me a green room to get ready

76
00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:36.885
and things did not go well.

77
00:03:37.995 --> 00:03:41.965
Have you ever tried to pull skinny jeans over adult diapers?

78
00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:46.405
You ever tried to do that? I had

79
00:03:46.405 --> 00:03:47.765
to leave the skinny jeans behind

80
00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:49.285
and wear my middle aged dockers.

81
00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:52.765
It was so sad, but at least the young people knew the sermon

82
00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:53.925
will be brief.

83
00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:01.405
Anyway, I feel an instant closeness with you

84
00:04:01.405 --> 00:04:03.365
because I happen to know a whole bunch

85
00:04:03.385 --> 00:04:06.685
of you were sitting in the audience at Falls Creek when I

86
00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:09.645
was preaching, but actually that would just apply to those

87
00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:11.165
of you that are 50 or older.

88
00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:16.125
So we won't talk about the rest of you. Uh, true statement.

89
00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:20.845
I have been through, I have experienced two

90
00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:23.685
spiritual awakenings in my life

91
00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:25.485
and I wanna tell you about them.

92
00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:30.525
The first spiritual awakening occurred when I was 19.

93
00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:33.845
It was part of the Jesus movement. Do you know that term?

94
00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:34.965
The Jesus movement.

95
00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:39.125
Uh, in the late 1960s, about half a million,

96
00:04:40.305 --> 00:04:43.845
mainly college students just dropped out of society,

97
00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:47.765
left school and many of them moved into communes.

98
00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:52.845
Communes were places of LSD, free love, artistic expression.

99
00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:54.165
We call them either hippies,

100
00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:55.885
we call them the flower children.

101
00:04:56.855 --> 00:05:00.605
Those people were just about as lost

102
00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:02.725
as any human being can be,

103
00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:08.125
but a supernatural Jesus just by his own designs.

104
00:05:09.105 --> 00:05:12.645
In a short period of time, late 1969,

105
00:05:13.015 --> 00:05:16.965
early 1970, began to win hundreds

106
00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:20.125
of thousands of those hippies to Jesus

107
00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:23.405
and they became hardcore followers of his.

108
00:05:24.135 --> 00:05:26.965
Maybe you saw the movie Jesus Revolution.

109
00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:30.525
I know you would remember those multitudes

110
00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:34.245
of young people out in the Pacific Ocean being baptized.

111
00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:35.725
It was so exciting.

112
00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:39.285
By the way, I actually appeared in that movie.

113
00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:40.805
If you want to touch me

114
00:05:40.805 --> 00:05:45.645
after the service that can be arranged Most

115
00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:49.045
of revolution, you know, they had to recreate most of that,

116
00:05:49.105 --> 00:05:52.805
but they used some actual footage from the revival.

117
00:05:53.335 --> 00:05:56.445
There was one shot of a quarter of a million

118
00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:58.805
of us at a huge Jesus festival.

119
00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:01.165
One of those pixels is me.

120
00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:04.525
I'm not really sure which pixel that is, but that's me.

121
00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:07.645
And I want you to know that I was in the movie.

122
00:06:09.585 --> 00:06:11.565
The second spiritual awakening

123
00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:15.205
that I had was not a broad awakening like

124
00:06:15.305 --> 00:06:16.365
the Jesus movement.

125
00:06:17.025 --> 00:06:21.325
The Second Awakening took place 36 years later

126
00:06:22.505 --> 00:06:23.925
and it was personal to me.

127
00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:28.925
I heard about a man in New Jersey

128
00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:32.845
that was talking about Jesus in a way

129
00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:36.965
that I was not familiar with and, and I was intrigued

130
00:06:37.825 --> 00:06:39.565
and I thought, I've gotta hear more about

131
00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:40.805
what this man has to say.

132
00:06:40.825 --> 00:06:44.485
So I wrote him, I said, Hey, I'm nobody.

133
00:06:44.825 --> 00:06:47.205
You don't know me and you're really busy,

134
00:06:48.065 --> 00:06:51.085
but if I come up to New Jersey, you have to eat lunch.

135
00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:53.765
Could I just sit with you while you eat lunch

136
00:06:53.865 --> 00:06:55.765
and you talk to me about Jesus?

137
00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:58.045
And he wrote me back and he said, I don't know you

138
00:06:58.385 --> 00:06:59.445
and I am really busy,

139
00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:03.205
but I would welcome sharing a lunch with you.

140
00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:07.245
So I went. He began to talk with me about Jesus,

141
00:07:07.425 --> 00:07:08.565
but in a specific way.

142
00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:13.205
He really put a focus on via the ascension of Jesus

143
00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:15.245
from the Mount of Olives.

144
00:07:15.255 --> 00:07:17.245
40 days after the empty tomb

145
00:07:18.725 --> 00:07:21.345
and that passage of scripture, the truthfulness of

146
00:07:21.345 --> 00:07:25.305
that scripture began to rock my world.

147
00:07:26.485 --> 00:07:29.145
We really looked carefully at Psalm one 10.

148
00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:32.105
Let me just read the verses that were so important to me.

149
00:07:32.855 --> 00:07:35.705
King David was given supernatural ability

150
00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:39.825
to look a thousand years into the future to see an event

151
00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:41.265
that would actually take place.

152
00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:43.705
And this is what David saw looking forward.

153
00:07:44.885 --> 00:07:49.105
The Lord says to my Lord, sit at my right hand

154
00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:51.905
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.

155
00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:55.745
The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion.

156
00:07:56.245 --> 00:07:58.745
You will rule in the midst of your enemies.

157
00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:03.445
I thought, oh my goodness, Jesus ascended.

158
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.005
I did know about that. But then as he went

159
00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:09.805
through the clouds, he returned to heaven

160
00:08:10.505 --> 00:08:12.405
and as he returned to heaven,

161
00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:15.365
he approached his father in heaven

162
00:08:15.785 --> 00:08:19.605
and the Bible says his father said, son,

163
00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:21.965
be enthroned at my right hand.

164
00:08:22.925 --> 00:08:25.325
I will make your enemies a footstool for your feet.

165
00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:30.085
I will put the scepter of all authority in your your hand.

166
00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:33.325
From that moment until this morning,

167
00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:38.925
Jesus has been reigning king of kings and Lord of lords.

168
00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:43.565
Not only is he my sacrifice, not only is he my savior, he

169
00:08:44.225 --> 00:08:46.085
is my monarch.

170
00:08:47.145 --> 00:08:49.085
He is my king.

171
00:08:50.675 --> 00:08:54.405
Henderson Hills believes in the second coming, all of you do

172
00:08:55.385 --> 00:08:56.925
the way things are going in the world.

173
00:08:57.065 --> 00:08:58.965
It might be sooner rather than later,

174
00:08:59.025 --> 00:09:02.845
but what if you're alive at the second coming?

175
00:09:03.995 --> 00:09:06.285
What if you go out in your front yard

176
00:09:06.285 --> 00:09:09.045
because of the trumpet music and you look up

177
00:09:09.105 --> 00:09:13.765
and you literally see Jesus split open the heavens

178
00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:18.645
and you see him descend to earth in that moment?

179
00:09:18.835 --> 00:09:21.725
What do you think in that moment as he is descending

180
00:09:21.725 --> 00:09:24.885
to earth, do you think he will be great and glorious?

181
00:09:25.045 --> 00:09:29.445
I know you do watch who Jesus is

182
00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:34.565
in his second coming is precisely who I was talking

183
00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:37.445
to in my living room at four o'clock this morning.

184
00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:39.445
That is who he is.

185
00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:41.485
I'm not trying to be facetious,

186
00:09:41.505 --> 00:09:45.005
but it is almost as if on the day of the second coming,

187
00:09:45.455 --> 00:09:48.685
Jesus just stands up from the throne steps over here

188
00:09:48.945 --> 00:09:50.205
and drops to earth.

189
00:09:50.675 --> 00:09:54.645
What I'm trying to say is that is who he is.

190
00:09:56.565 --> 00:09:59.125
I just wonder, I'm asking you individually,

191
00:10:00.785 --> 00:10:04.765
is it possible that you're kind of where I was

192
00:10:05.465 --> 00:10:09.045
in 2006, you've been redeemed,

193
00:10:09.705 --> 00:10:11.725
you've even been transformed somewhat,

194
00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:17.045
but do you need to experience a Christ awakening

195
00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:20.845
to help you know, would you allow me

196
00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:23.005
to ask you some personal questions?

197
00:10:24.715 --> 00:10:26.645
When you prayed this morning,

198
00:10:26.945 --> 00:10:29.125
I'm talking about at home this morning.

199
00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:33.845
Did you have any sense in your prayers this morning?

200
00:10:35.005 --> 00:10:38.405
I am approaching the king of glory.

201
00:10:38.745 --> 00:10:39.885
Any sense of that at all?

202
00:10:41.185 --> 00:10:45.245
Did anything in your voice sound like I am speaking

203
00:10:45.505 --> 00:10:47.285
to royalty?

204
00:10:49.025 --> 00:10:50.365
You know your prayer this morning?

205
00:10:50.455 --> 00:10:53.805
Would you say you spent more time

206
00:10:54.635 --> 00:10:56.005
declaring his glory

207
00:10:56.065 --> 00:10:58.725
and greatness than you spent asking for things?

208
00:11:00.495 --> 00:11:01.755
Here's a powerful question.

209
00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:04.795
Are their members of your family

210
00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:09.875
or your close friends who've been smitten with the greatness

211
00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:14.235
of Christ because of spending time with you?

212
00:11:14.815 --> 00:11:17.835
I'm gonna repeat that. Are there members of your family

213
00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:21.555
or your close friends who've been smitten with the greatness

214
00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:25.595
of Christ because of spending time with you?

215
00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:29.235
Are you contagious? So I ask you again,

216
00:11:30.455 --> 00:11:32.875
do you need a Christ awakening?

217
00:11:33.895 --> 00:11:36.395
And of course that question raises another question.

218
00:11:36.945 --> 00:11:39.235
What exactly is a Christ awakening?

219
00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:40.795
I'll give you a definition.

220
00:11:42.115 --> 00:11:46.355
A Christ awakening occurs when God's spirit

221
00:11:47.785 --> 00:11:51.315
uses God's word to wake up a believer

222
00:11:51.775 --> 00:11:55.005
to the full extent of the supremacy of Christ.

223
00:11:56.295 --> 00:11:59.485
Three themes. First, you are awakened

224
00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:00.765
to his enthroned glory.

225
00:12:01.225 --> 00:12:04.165
Second, you begin to adore him more deeply.

226
00:12:04.855 --> 00:12:06.045
Third, you arise

227
00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:09.325
to join him in bringing his kingdom on earth.

228
00:12:09.425 --> 00:12:12.485
We need to explore each of those three themes.

229
00:12:12.735 --> 00:12:15.885
First, you are awakened

230
00:12:16.225 --> 00:12:17.965
to his enthroned glory.

231
00:12:19.235 --> 00:12:21.765
Henderson Hills does things by the book.

232
00:12:22.625 --> 00:12:24.525
I'm not talking about an operations manual.

233
00:12:24.705 --> 00:12:27.965
I'm talking about the book the Bible to discover

234
00:12:27.965 --> 00:12:31.125
what the enthroned glory of Christ consists of.

235
00:12:31.145 --> 00:12:34.005
We go to scripture and that's exactly what I'm about to do.

236
00:12:35.485 --> 00:12:39.045
I sat down and went from Genesis to Revelation

237
00:12:39.585 --> 00:12:41.965
and found the following scriptures

238
00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:44.845
that present the glory of God the Son.

239
00:12:45.495 --> 00:12:48.925
Everything I'm about to say is scripture.

240
00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:52.045
I want you to take every phrase of scripture

241
00:12:52.185 --> 00:12:54.165
and let this sink into your heart.

242
00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:57.425
He Jesus is

243
00:12:57.425 --> 00:13:00.825
before all things by him Jesus,

244
00:13:01.285 --> 00:13:05.585
all things were created in heaven and on earth in Him.

245
00:13:05.955 --> 00:13:08.465
Jesus, all things hold together.

246
00:13:09.605 --> 00:13:13.985
He Jesus is the image of the invisible God

247
00:13:14.405 --> 00:13:16.705
and the radiance of God's glory.

248
00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:20.785
He Jesus is the exact expression

249
00:13:20.845 --> 00:13:23.265
of God's nature in Him.

250
00:13:23.725 --> 00:13:27.265
All the fullness of God is pleased to dwell.

251
00:13:28.765 --> 00:13:31.265
God has highly exalted him Jesus

252
00:13:31.405 --> 00:13:34.905
and bestowed on him the name that is above every name.

253
00:13:36.045 --> 00:13:38.545
He Jesus is enthroned at the right hand

254
00:13:38.545 --> 00:13:39.985
of the majesty on high.

255
00:13:40.645 --> 00:13:42.625
His throne is forever and ever.

256
00:13:42.925 --> 00:13:46.785
The Father has bestowed splendor and majesty on him. Jesus.

257
00:13:47.365 --> 00:13:50.505
He is wonderful counselor. He is prince of peace.

258
00:13:50.885 --> 00:13:52.945
His dominion is an everlasting dominion

259
00:13:52.975 --> 00:13:54.425
that will not pass away.

260
00:13:54.805 --> 00:13:56.705
His kingdom will not be destroyed.

261
00:13:57.005 --> 00:13:59.025
His greatness reaches to the end of the earth.

262
00:13:59.325 --> 00:14:01.945
He Jesus is the head of the body, the church,

263
00:14:02.565 --> 00:14:05.945
he Jesus is preeminent all authority in heaven

264
00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:07.865
and on earth has been given to him.

265
00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:10.345
Jesus as the lamb who was slain.

266
00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:13.425
He is worthy to receive power and wealth and wisdom

267
00:14:13.565 --> 00:14:15.985
and strength and honor and glory and praise.

268
00:14:16.565 --> 00:14:19.305
He Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.

269
00:14:19.765 --> 00:14:23.345
He Jesus is the alpha and the Omega, the first

270
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:25.345
and the last, the beginning and the end.

271
00:14:25.685 --> 00:14:29.105
And this morning a multitude sings to him

272
00:14:29.165 --> 00:14:32.665
who sits on the throne and to the lamb be praised and honor

273
00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:35.825
and glory in power forever and ever.

274
00:14:35.935 --> 00:14:38.985
Henderson heals. That is who my Jesus is.

275
00:14:45.525 --> 00:14:47.305
I'm asking you the personal question.

276
00:14:47.405 --> 00:14:51.245
Do you need to be more awakened to that Jesus

277
00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:56.265
first you are awakened to his enthroned glory,

278
00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:59.265
but second, you deeply adore him.

279
00:15:00.485 --> 00:15:02.505
You can remember your prayers from this morning.

280
00:15:03.965 --> 00:15:06.305
Do you remember any part of your prayer this morning

281
00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:08.425
that sounded like adoration?

282
00:15:09.445 --> 00:15:10.465
Not thanking him,

283
00:15:11.485 --> 00:15:14.665
but telling him you literally adore him?

284
00:15:16.285 --> 00:15:18.905
Now, some of you may think this is a little simplistic,

285
00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:20.545
and I apologize if you do,

286
00:15:21.685 --> 00:15:23.825
but I do my morning worship in our living room.

287
00:15:23.885 --> 00:15:24.985
Nobody else is awake.

288
00:15:24.985 --> 00:15:27.985
So I have a lot of freedom to just kind of do my thing.

289
00:15:27.985 --> 00:15:32.595
I think I very much like sitting on one side

290
00:15:32.595 --> 00:15:35.635
of the room and picturing on the opposite side of the room

291
00:15:36.295 --> 00:15:38.115
an elevated throne.

292
00:15:39.065 --> 00:15:42.035
Sometimes I walk over to it when I walk over

293
00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:43.395
to the elevated throne,

294
00:15:43.775 --> 00:15:45.915
the footstool is about even with my eyes.

295
00:15:46.315 --> 00:15:49.475
I like standing before that elevated throne

296
00:15:49.705 --> 00:15:53.555
because I never wanna forget the regal glory of who he is

297
00:15:53.895 --> 00:15:57.115
and it causes my heart to adore him more.

298
00:15:58.335 --> 00:16:00.635
Now, you don't have to use your imagination like that,

299
00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:03.595
but I wanna ask you, does any part

300
00:16:03.615 --> 00:16:07.515
of your mourning prayer sound like adoration?

301
00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:11.155
Let me just give you an earthly example

302
00:16:11.215 --> 00:16:12.395
of what I'm talking about.

303
00:16:13.255 --> 00:16:15.075
You might remember the story of King David

304
00:16:15.735 --> 00:16:17.355
and his three mighty men.

305
00:16:18.015 --> 00:16:20.275
Let me read to you from second Samuel 23.

306
00:16:21.845 --> 00:16:24.155
David was then in the stronghold

307
00:16:24.295 --> 00:16:27.875
and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.

308
00:16:28.965 --> 00:16:32.835
David said, longingly, oh, that someone would give me water

309
00:16:32.855 --> 00:16:34.835
to drink from the well of Bethlehem.

310
00:16:34.835 --> 00:16:35.915
That is by the gate.

311
00:16:36.905 --> 00:16:40.155
Then the three mighty men broke through the camp

312
00:16:40.155 --> 00:16:41.155
of the Philistines

313
00:16:41.455 --> 00:16:44.475
and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was

314
00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:47.075
by the gate and carried and brought it to David.

315
00:16:47.535 --> 00:16:52.355
Now, why did these warriors risk their lives

316
00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:55.075
to break through the Philistine lines?

317
00:16:55.775 --> 00:16:57.675
Was there a military objective

318
00:16:58.295 --> 00:17:01.595
to bring back a really great tasting glass of water?

319
00:17:01.735 --> 00:17:06.635
Of course not. These burly warriors had a soft spot.

320
00:17:06.945 --> 00:17:08.995
They adored their king

321
00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:11.875
and they were ready to lay down their lives just

322
00:17:11.935 --> 00:17:13.075
to do something for him.

323
00:17:14.595 --> 00:17:19.105
Those of you that are parents, would you take a bullet

324
00:17:19.365 --> 00:17:22.145
for your child in a heartbeat?

325
00:17:22.285 --> 00:17:26.025
Why? Because you adore your child. Now, wonderful.

326
00:17:26.815 --> 00:17:28.985
Just multiply that times a thousand

327
00:17:29.605 --> 00:17:30.945
and apply it to king Jesus.

328
00:17:32.095 --> 00:17:33.305
What? Just what if?

329
00:17:33.495 --> 00:17:36.145
What if someday you're captured for your Christian faith

330
00:17:37.385 --> 00:17:40.885
and you find yourself in an orange jumpsuit

331
00:17:42.355 --> 00:17:44.205
with a black sack over your head

332
00:17:45.305 --> 00:17:47.525
and a guy behind you with a big sword?

333
00:17:49.305 --> 00:17:53.245
In your final moments, would you be willing to say,

334
00:17:54.035 --> 00:17:56.925
this is for the king I adore?

335
00:17:58.075 --> 00:18:00.045
Only when you're ready to die for him,

336
00:18:00.185 --> 00:18:02.685
are you actually ready to live for him?

337
00:18:03.295 --> 00:18:06.565
Everything you are, everything you do should be motivated

338
00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:10.685
by a deep adoration for God the Son.

339
00:18:11.535 --> 00:18:14.845
First, you're awakened to Jesus's enthroned glory.

340
00:18:15.185 --> 00:18:16.925
Second, you deeply adore him.

341
00:18:17.105 --> 00:18:18.925
Now, third, you arise

342
00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:22.085
to join him in bringing his kingdom on earth.

343
00:18:24.675 --> 00:18:28.265
Think about the complete gospel when you're redeemed,

344
00:18:28.805 --> 00:18:31.625
you're receiving Christ who died on the cross,

345
00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:36.065
rose from the grave and ascended to glory.

346
00:18:36.965 --> 00:18:38.185
That's the complete gospel.

347
00:18:39.245 --> 00:18:41.705
10 days after the ascension, just 10 days,

348
00:18:42.515 --> 00:18:44.345
Peter preached to Pentecost.

349
00:18:44.735 --> 00:18:46.385
Have you ever noticed his outline?

350
00:18:47.205 --> 00:18:50.905
Let me point you toward Acts two in verse 23.

351
00:18:51.035 --> 00:18:54.625
Peter says this, Jesus, you crucified

352
00:18:54.685 --> 00:18:56.865
and killed by the hands of lawless men.

353
00:18:56.965 --> 00:18:58.065
That's crucifixion.

354
00:18:58.355 --> 00:19:03.225
Verse 32, this Jesus God raised up. That's resurrection.

355
00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:08.185
Verse 33, he Jesus was exalted at the right hand of God.

356
00:19:08.525 --> 00:19:09.625
That's coronation.

357
00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:12.945
When you have conversations with others about Jesus,

358
00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:17.225
I challenge you to use Peter's outline, crucifixion,

359
00:19:18.105 --> 00:19:20.265
resurrection, and coronation.

360
00:19:21.775 --> 00:19:25.785
Such conversations coming from you can be crucial in 2025.

361
00:19:25.845 --> 00:19:30.195
Do you know why? Right now our churches

362
00:19:30.735 --> 00:19:35.345
are filled with church members that would have

363
00:19:35.345 --> 00:19:40.095
to honestly admit, my faith is all about me

364
00:19:41.355 --> 00:19:45.695
and I expect my faith to bring good things

365
00:19:46.195 --> 00:19:50.495
to me and mine their primary prayers sound like this.

366
00:19:51.635 --> 00:19:54.495
Hey Jesus, come down here

367
00:19:54.635 --> 00:19:58.615
and just make everything peachy for me in those in my world.

368
00:20:00.435 --> 00:20:02.805
Does that sound like a Christ awakening to you?

369
00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:08.225
I love my wife more than I can express.

370
00:20:09.745 --> 00:20:12.325
We have been head over heels in love with each other

371
00:20:12.585 --> 00:20:14.925
for 53 years.

372
00:20:15.285 --> 00:20:17.645
I cannot tell you how precious she is,

373
00:20:19.025 --> 00:20:20.485
but she has a challenge.

374
00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:23.885
If you were to discover

375
00:20:23.915 --> 00:20:26.405
that you have an aneurysm on an artery

376
00:20:26.705 --> 00:20:29.325
and that aneurysm is as big as a grape,

377
00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.605
that would be serious news for you.

378
00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:36.885
But if a doctor told you now that aneurysm has grown

379
00:20:36.905 --> 00:20:39.245
to be the size of a ping pong ball,

380
00:20:39.785 --> 00:20:42.285
you would start getting your affairs in it in order.

381
00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:47.925
My wife though, has discovered her aneurysm is the

382
00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:49.245
size of an egg.

383
00:20:49.985 --> 00:20:52.445
It is stretched so thin that it's going to break.

384
00:20:52.505 --> 00:20:55.525
And the doctors have told us when it breaks,

385
00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:59.905
the ambulance will not even make it to our house.

386
00:21:01.705 --> 00:21:03.045
So how am I supposed to pray for her?

387
00:21:05.075 --> 00:21:07.085
Only by the power of the Holy Spirit.

388
00:21:07.155 --> 00:21:08.525
This is my primary prayer.

389
00:21:10.275 --> 00:21:14.525
Lord Jesus, would you find creative ways in this

390
00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:16.045
despicable situation?

391
00:21:16.055 --> 00:21:19.925
Would you find ways to draw all attention to yourself?

392
00:21:20.215 --> 00:21:23.965
Would you be glorified in the midst of all

393
00:21:23.965 --> 00:21:25.405
that is taking place?

394
00:21:26.665 --> 00:21:30.325
And then as a secondary prayer, I do pray.

395
00:21:30.825 --> 00:21:33.925
And Lord Jesus, if somehow it could fit in with your plans

396
00:21:33.945 --> 00:21:37.325
and purposes, I would ask with faith that you make my wife.

397
00:21:37.395 --> 00:21:41.325
Well, we were hoping for a house full of kids.

398
00:21:42.785 --> 00:21:46.565
Didn't happen. The doctors finally said,

399
00:21:46.745 --> 00:21:48.485
now we think you will never have children.

400
00:21:48.625 --> 00:21:53.005
And they were almost right. 16 years of waiting.

401
00:21:54.305 --> 00:21:57.445
And finally inexplicably, my wife shows up pregnant.

402
00:21:58.225 --> 00:22:00.045
And the result of that is Clayton,

403
00:22:00.105 --> 00:22:04.925
our only living offspring, he is a big

404
00:22:05.515 --> 00:22:06.765
deal to me.

405
00:22:08.315 --> 00:22:09.965
When he sees me on our campus,

406
00:22:10.135 --> 00:22:12.085
he'll walk halfway across campus

407
00:22:12.225 --> 00:22:13.925
to pick me up and give me a hug.

408
00:22:15.005 --> 00:22:17.645
I love him and he loves Jesus.

409
00:22:18.395 --> 00:22:20.005
When he first started in college,

410
00:22:20.225 --> 00:22:22.245
he was going on multiple mission trips,

411
00:22:22.365 --> 00:22:23.645
international mission trips,

412
00:22:24.025 --> 00:22:27.725
served in South Africa an entire semester, Ethiopia

413
00:22:28.325 --> 00:22:31.105
multiple times, but he got sick.

414
00:22:31.925 --> 00:22:33.865
So he called me up and he said, Hey dad,

415
00:22:33.965 --> 00:22:35.025
I'm not feeling that great.

416
00:22:35.885 --> 00:22:37.025
How about I come home

417
00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:39.385
and y'all just take care of me for the weekend,

418
00:22:39.575 --> 00:22:42.065
wash my clothes, just take care of me

419
00:22:42.065 --> 00:22:43.145
and then I'll be good to go.

420
00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:45.185
And we said, of course, come to our house.

421
00:22:46.645 --> 00:22:49.025
So he came home, crawled in bed

422
00:22:49.765 --> 00:22:53.905
and did not leave that bed for 10 years.

423
00:22:56.185 --> 00:22:59.025
Actually, he was too weak to make it to his bedroom.

424
00:22:59.285 --> 00:23:00.425
On the second floor,

425
00:23:00.805 --> 00:23:03.385
we have a little bitty guest bedroom

426
00:23:03.595 --> 00:23:04.905
right off the dining room.

427
00:23:05.325 --> 00:23:08.625
He stayed in that little guest room for 10

428
00:23:09.275 --> 00:23:10.425
solid years.

429
00:23:12.165 --> 00:23:14.025
All of his buds from my school, all

430
00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:17.945
of his friends getting married, having babies, leaving town

431
00:23:18.005 --> 00:23:19.585
to go start their ministries.

432
00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:23.385
And my son is in bed as sick as he can be.

433
00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:27.745
So when I stand at his door

434
00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:29.905
for 10 years early in the morning,

435
00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.185
what am I supposed to pray?

436
00:23:34.085 --> 00:23:38.015
King Jesus, be glorified in all of this.

437
00:23:39.325 --> 00:23:42.775
Make your name even greater on this earth.

438
00:23:43.445 --> 00:23:45.325
Take this entire situation

439
00:23:45.465 --> 00:23:49.405
and cause other people's eyes to be lifted to you.

440
00:23:51.505 --> 00:23:54.955
Secondary prayer. And Jesus, somehow if it could fit,

441
00:23:55.965 --> 00:23:58.875
would you make my son well so he could get on with life?

442
00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:03.975
What about you? How would you pray in a moment like that?

443
00:24:05.875 --> 00:24:09.175
Did you know we have a name for Christianity?

444
00:24:09.635 --> 00:24:12.015
That's all about me. We have a name for it.

445
00:24:12.165 --> 00:24:14.575
Seminarians love, big words. Here's the big word.

446
00:24:14.875 --> 00:24:17.095
We call it moral therapeutic deism.

447
00:24:17.995 --> 00:24:19.095
Now, I mentioned to you earlier,

448
00:24:19.315 --> 00:24:21.295
I'm still out speaking to the teenagers.

449
00:24:21.395 --> 00:24:25.415
Can I, can I walk into an auditorium of teenagers

450
00:24:25.415 --> 00:24:27.175
and say, guess what, you guys have a case

451
00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:28.735
of moral therapeutic deism.

452
00:24:28.775 --> 00:24:32.135
I can't say that, but you know what I can say,

453
00:24:33.095 --> 00:24:34.535
I can say precious teenager.

454
00:24:34.795 --> 00:24:38.895
Is it possible that you have little Jesus in my pocket?

455
00:24:39.155 --> 00:24:42.175
Is it possible that you have little friend,

456
00:24:42.175 --> 00:24:44.895
little buddy Jesus who rides with you through the day?

457
00:24:45.425 --> 00:24:48.895
Maybe you would even say you love him. He's so special.

458
00:24:49.395 --> 00:24:52.055
But because he's little, the nice thing about

459
00:24:52.055 --> 00:24:55.055
that is you can push him way down in your pocket not

460
00:24:55.055 --> 00:24:56.535
to really bother you during the day

461
00:24:56.865 --> 00:24:58.655
until you have a problem or a need.

462
00:24:58.875 --> 00:25:01.375
And then little Jesus can come out and fix it.

463
00:25:01.395 --> 00:25:04.815
In fact, I tell the boys, the upperclassmen, I'll say,

464
00:25:04.815 --> 00:25:05.895
Hey guys, what a deal.

465
00:25:06.035 --> 00:25:07.375
You can take a little Jesus

466
00:25:07.955 --> 00:25:11.575
and push him way down in your tux pocket on prom night

467
00:25:11.765 --> 00:25:14.615
knowing he's not supposed to have anything to say about

468
00:25:14.615 --> 00:25:16.615
what you're gonna do with your girlfriend that night.

469
00:25:16.805 --> 00:25:18.295
He's just a little Jesus.

470
00:25:18.955 --> 00:25:20.495
But two weeks after prom,

471
00:25:20.805 --> 00:25:22.895
what if they tell you your mother's got cancer?

472
00:25:23.115 --> 00:25:24.215
Oh, that's a big deal.

473
00:25:24.635 --> 00:25:27.855
So now little Jesus comes out of my pocket. Jesus.

474
00:25:27.945 --> 00:25:30.215
Jesus, make my mother's cancer all better.

475
00:25:30.395 --> 00:25:31.855
But when the cancer's in remission,

476
00:25:32.115 --> 00:25:33.375
oh great, we're past that.

477
00:25:33.835 --> 00:25:35.895
You go back in my pocket to be mostly

478
00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:39.975
not important in my life till I need you again.

479
00:25:40.525 --> 00:25:42.575
He's just a little Jesus

480
00:25:44.925 --> 00:25:46.855
lest you think that's a teenage issue.

481
00:25:48.675 --> 00:25:52.095
Senior adults can have a little Jesus.

482
00:25:53.795 --> 00:25:57.775
10 year olds can have a little Jesus

483
00:25:59.685 --> 00:26:03.095
parents can have a little

484
00:26:04.185 --> 00:26:06.785
Jesus, mom and dad.

485
00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:07.945
I just wanna say something.

486
00:26:09.495 --> 00:26:10.945
When my Clayton was small,

487
00:26:11.895 --> 00:26:14.785
sometimes I would bring Clayton up on the platform.

488
00:26:15.135 --> 00:26:16.945
When I was trying to teach mom

489
00:26:16.945 --> 00:26:19.265
and dad about how faith moves a generation.

490
00:26:19.455 --> 00:26:22.025
Sometimes I would bring Clayton up on platform

491
00:26:22.325 --> 00:26:24.225
and I would take one end of this pipe

492
00:26:24.485 --> 00:26:26.105
and I would put it against my heart,

493
00:26:26.405 --> 00:26:28.425
and then I would pull Clayton up so

494
00:26:28.425 --> 00:26:29.545
that I could put the other end

495
00:26:29.545 --> 00:26:30.985
of this pipe against his heart

496
00:26:31.245 --> 00:26:34.185
and then I could make a powerful point to parents.

497
00:26:35.485 --> 00:26:38.345
The way faith moves from one generation

498
00:26:38.405 --> 00:26:41.425
to the next generation is through a heart connection.

499
00:26:41.645 --> 00:26:43.645
It is a connection between the hearts.

500
00:26:43.795 --> 00:26:45.045
It's Malachi four, six,

501
00:26:45.065 --> 00:26:47.445
and he will turn the hearts of the parents to the kids

502
00:26:47.865 --> 00:26:50.005
and he will turn the hearts of the kids to the parent.

503
00:26:50.315 --> 00:26:52.685
That is how transmission of faith takes place.

504
00:26:54.025 --> 00:26:57.685
In fact, I have to caution parents, you get distracted

505
00:26:57.685 --> 00:26:59.925
with your life, you lose closeness with your kids.

506
00:27:00.105 --> 00:27:03.445
You parent in a bad way and push them away from you.

507
00:27:04.305 --> 00:27:06.605
You're gonna have this thing pulled out of your chest

508
00:27:06.705 --> 00:27:09.165
so much so that your child's gonna be left with plastic

509
00:27:09.225 --> 00:27:10.285
that's not connected,

510
00:27:10.465 --> 00:27:12.845
and they're gonna give their hearts to their buds

511
00:27:13.025 --> 00:27:15.925
and their buds are gonna put whatever ends up in their

512
00:27:15.925 --> 00:27:16.965
hearts and their hearts.

513
00:27:18.625 --> 00:27:23.005
But the point this morning is this mom

514
00:27:23.005 --> 00:27:27.405
and dad, if you have a small view

515
00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:30.325
of Jesus, if you would truthfully say,

516
00:27:31.605 --> 00:27:34.085
I think mostly I embrace my faith

517
00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:36.445
because it does bring advantages to me.

518
00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:39.685
If it is mostly a self-serving faith,

519
00:27:40.585 --> 00:27:42.605
that's what's gonna go in the pipe.

520
00:27:44.665 --> 00:27:48.525
The research says that the majority

521
00:27:49.425 --> 00:27:50.685
of these young adults

522
00:27:50.755 --> 00:27:54.765
that are deconstructing their faith are deconstructing a

523
00:27:54.765 --> 00:27:57.205
faith that was never that great in the first place.

524
00:27:57.625 --> 00:27:59.965
And often it was a faith that got,

525
00:27:59.965 --> 00:28:01.365
they got from mom and dad.

526
00:28:02.665 --> 00:28:06.195
What I'm trying to say, there are generational issues here

527
00:28:07.095 --> 00:28:10.195
it is one generation becoming smitten with the greatness

528
00:28:10.195 --> 00:28:12.355
of Christ worshiping him as king.

529
00:28:12.585 --> 00:28:15.635
That allows that to move down one and two

530
00:28:15.855 --> 00:28:16.955
and three generations.

531
00:28:18.745 --> 00:28:20.675
Paul absolutely got this.

532
00:28:21.655 --> 00:28:24.275
In fact, all of his letters are full

533
00:28:24.295 --> 00:28:25.795
of the supremacy of Christ.

534
00:28:26.465 --> 00:28:29.435
When you go back and read his letters with this filter,

535
00:28:29.485 --> 00:28:31.835
everything else just makes so much more sense.

536
00:28:33.135 --> 00:28:35.195
All of you could quote Philippians three, eight,

537
00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:38.075
but listen to it in in relationship to supremacy.

538
00:28:38.245 --> 00:28:43.155
Think I consider everything as if,

539
00:28:43.615 --> 00:28:46.235
as if loss compared to

540
00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:49.355
the surpassing greatness of Christ.

541
00:28:49.755 --> 00:28:54.395
I consider everything as if loss compared to

542
00:28:54.975 --> 00:28:56.675
the surpassing greatness of Christ.

543
00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:58.995
Is that true for you? I'm just asking

544
00:28:59.015 --> 00:29:00.395
you, is it true for you?

545
00:29:02.015 --> 00:29:04.875
Is there a human being on planet earth

546
00:29:06.225 --> 00:29:08.595
that is a bigger deal to you than Jesus?

547
00:29:13.805 --> 00:29:18.305
Is there a human being on earth that is more important

548
00:29:18.325 --> 00:29:19.665
to you than Jesus?

549
00:29:22.065 --> 00:29:23.355
That would be another sermon.

550
00:29:24.015 --> 00:29:27.155
But anything that's more important than Jesus is an idol,

551
00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:31.395
and God has a way of removing idols.

552
00:29:33.025 --> 00:29:36.555
What I'm asking you is have you been so smitten

553
00:29:36.555 --> 00:29:37.915
with the greatness of Christ

554
00:29:38.585 --> 00:29:42.645
that you would say His greatness makes every other part

555
00:29:42.665 --> 00:29:47.005
of me, every other part of my life pale in comparison?

556
00:29:48.985 --> 00:29:51.605
What's your passion in ministry college students?

557
00:29:51.665 --> 00:29:55.205
What's your passion? Do you wanna see people evangelizing

558
00:29:55.385 --> 00:29:57.285
the lo, the loss locally and globally?

559
00:29:57.625 --> 00:30:00.925
Do you long to see people discipling the redeemed

560
00:30:01.515 --> 00:30:02.765
into the image of Christ?

561
00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:06.845
Do you long to see people giving the young a lifetime faith?

562
00:30:07.145 --> 00:30:08.565
Do you want to impact the culture?

563
00:30:08.705 --> 00:30:09.965
Do you want to heal the broken?

564
00:30:10.025 --> 00:30:11.285
Do you want to feed the poor?

565
00:30:11.905 --> 00:30:14.165
All of those things are more likely

566
00:30:14.265 --> 00:30:17.205
and more powerful when you are awakened

567
00:30:17.205 --> 00:30:18.565
to the greatness of Christ.

568
00:30:20.075 --> 00:30:24.525
Hebrews one, two. In these last days,

569
00:30:24.905 --> 00:30:26.005
he triune God.

570
00:30:26.345 --> 00:30:28.285
In these last days He triune.

571
00:30:28.345 --> 00:30:30.845
God has spoken to us by his son.

572
00:30:31.105 --> 00:30:34.525
If triune, God is drawing unusual attention

573
00:30:34.545 --> 00:30:39.365
to the Son in our day, are you gonna join him in doing so?

574
00:30:40.895 --> 00:30:42.435
Here's my closing words to you.

575
00:30:44.395 --> 00:30:48.525
Will you leave these doors in just a few moments committed

576
00:30:49.465 --> 00:30:52.085
to continually awakening to the greatness of Christ?

577
00:30:52.595 --> 00:30:56.325
Will you leave committed to adoring your king regent

578
00:30:56.475 --> 00:30:58.965
with all of your heart, soul, mind, and strength?

579
00:30:59.955 --> 00:31:02.165
Will you leave committed to arising

580
00:31:02.165 --> 00:31:06.405
to join him in bringing his kingdom here on earth,

581
00:31:06.945 --> 00:31:10.005
all for the regal glory of Christ?

582
00:31:10.985 --> 00:31:15.925
All hail king Jesus, I'm gonna ask you to trust.

583
00:31:16.035 --> 00:31:17.645
Just trust me, it's worth it.

584
00:31:17.645 --> 00:31:19.365
Would you take everything out of your hands,

585
00:31:19.535 --> 00:31:20.965
under your, put it under your seat?

586
00:31:21.015 --> 00:31:23.965
Would you just empty your hands? Just trust me.

587
00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:26.525
Please just empty your hands.

588
00:31:28.665 --> 00:31:31.205
And I'm not gonna mess with you, but I want you to do this.

589
00:31:31.205 --> 00:31:32.805
Would you put your hands on your knees?

590
00:31:32.985 --> 00:31:35.125
Put both hands on your knees. Just put 'em right here.

591
00:31:37.855 --> 00:31:41.685
Close your eyes. Close your eyes. All eyes closed.

592
00:31:42.705 --> 00:31:45.365
Now, would you roll your palms up? Just roll your palms up.

593
00:31:48.515 --> 00:31:50.205
What? What? What do you want to receive right now?

594
00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:51.125
What do you want to receive?

595
00:31:55.305 --> 00:31:59.085
So many times in this sermon, I have said, do you need

596
00:31:59.085 --> 00:32:02.205
to be awakened to the greatness of Christ?

597
00:32:05.205 --> 00:32:07.405
November 6th, 2006,

598
00:32:08.985 --> 00:32:12.165
I'm sitting in a Holiday Inn eating a salad, listening

599
00:32:12.165 --> 00:32:13.965
to a man talk about King Jesus.

600
00:32:14.505 --> 00:32:16.885
And my world was turned upside down.

601
00:32:19.775 --> 00:32:24.765
Could an August 24th, 2025 be your day?

602
00:32:27.015 --> 00:32:31.485
Could you someday be lying in hospice

603
00:32:33.675 --> 00:32:36.325
with a smile on your face saying,

604
00:32:38.675 --> 00:32:42.965
Most of my life I was

605
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:47.285
adoring and living for king Jesus most of my life.

606
00:32:47.785 --> 00:32:50.045
And you know, that all goes back to

607
00:32:51.105 --> 00:32:53.005
an August day in 2025

608
00:32:53.715 --> 00:32:56.125
when I saw the king in a new way.

609
00:32:56.995 --> 00:32:58.645
What I'm really saying to you is,

610
00:32:58.735 --> 00:33:02.445
could scriptural insights this morning by the power

611
00:33:02.465 --> 00:33:06.285
of the Holy Spirit, create a flip in your heart

612
00:33:06.395 --> 00:33:09.765
that really does typify the rest of your time on earth?

613
00:33:13.105 --> 00:33:14.125
It could very well be

614
00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:17.485
that someone right now have has uplifted palms.

615
00:33:17.785 --> 00:33:20.765
But the only thing you could possibly receive this morning

616
00:33:21.025 --> 00:33:24.685
is a brand new first time relationship with Jesus.

617
00:33:26.025 --> 00:33:28.565
And if you don't know him, if you've never met him,

618
00:33:28.825 --> 00:33:30.485
you can tell by by my sermon,

619
00:33:30.585 --> 00:33:33.845
you can tell there are some believers, maybe a lot

620
00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:35.925
of believers who do know him,

621
00:33:36.345 --> 00:33:39.525
but they're really having to catch up in who he actually is.

622
00:33:39.905 --> 00:33:41.445
Person that doesn't know Jesus.

623
00:33:41.705 --> 00:33:44.205
Why don't you just go zero to 60 in one day?

624
00:33:45.425 --> 00:33:47.725
Why don't you just decide if I'm gonna give my heart

625
00:33:47.725 --> 00:33:49.925
and life to Jesus, I'm gonna go all in.

626
00:33:50.995 --> 00:33:53.285
He's gonna be my king from the beginning.

627
00:33:54.475 --> 00:33:57.405
What a wonderful way to begin your Christian experience.

628
00:33:58.795 --> 00:34:01.005
Some of you're trying to figure out your future, some

629
00:34:01.005 --> 00:34:02.965
of you're trying to figure out, where do I go from here?

630
00:34:02.995 --> 00:34:04.205
What do I do? Vocation?

631
00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:07.685
Can you think of anything more exciting to say?

632
00:34:08.815 --> 00:34:11.365
Jesus will give me more details later,

633
00:34:11.585 --> 00:34:16.005
but right now I am declaring to him that my life, my future,

634
00:34:16.225 --> 00:34:20.165
is going to be all drenched with the greatness of Christ.

635
00:34:21.315 --> 00:34:25.045
Even my vocation is gonna be saturated with a desire

636
00:34:25.045 --> 00:34:27.645
to bring his kingdom here on the earth.

637
00:34:29.165 --> 00:34:31.005
I wonder, would any of those topics be

638
00:34:31.005 --> 00:34:32.205
worth a conversation for you?

639
00:34:33.415 --> 00:34:36.085
Would it be worth it for you to say, I'm intrigued

640
00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:37.925
with having a relationship with Christ.

641
00:34:38.205 --> 00:34:40.005
I have no idea how that works.

642
00:34:40.525 --> 00:34:42.365
There're gonna be folk that would love to talk

643
00:34:42.365 --> 00:34:43.845
with you about that in just a moment.

644
00:34:44.915 --> 00:34:47.325
Equally, there are gonna be people that would love to talk

645
00:34:47.325 --> 00:34:48.765
with anyone that's really trying

646
00:34:48.845 --> 00:34:50.205
to pray and think through the future.

647
00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:51.525
Where do I go from here?

648
00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:55.645
Somebody struggling with a massive secret sin

649
00:34:56.705 --> 00:34:58.325
is sucking the life out of you.

650
00:34:58.415 --> 00:35:01.365
Could it be that you falling

651
00:35:01.465 --> 00:35:04.285
before the throne of your king would be the place

652
00:35:04.675 --> 00:35:08.205
that you would find cleansing and grace and forgiveness

653
00:35:08.745 --> 00:35:10.845
and freedom to move forward in your life?

654
00:35:12.965 --> 00:35:15.685
I just want you to know that it's not an accident

655
00:35:15.685 --> 00:35:17.525
that you're here, it's not an accident

656
00:35:17.525 --> 00:35:20.525
that you're hearing this particular teaching this morning,

657
00:35:21.075 --> 00:35:24.445
because I think a bunch of you would say, this is going

658
00:35:24.445 --> 00:35:26.365
to mark a change in my life.

659
00:35:27.045 --> 00:35:31.365
I am going to run hard after my king the rest of my days.

660
00:35:31.515 --> 00:35:34.405
Lord Jesus, I'm praying in that direction. I'm praying.

661
00:35:34.585 --> 00:35:37.485
I'm asking you, Lord Jesus, would you come

662
00:35:37.485 --> 00:35:38.725
and do beautiful things?

663
00:35:38.815 --> 00:35:40.685
Would you honor every conversation

664
00:35:41.185 --> 00:35:43.725
and silent prayer for your name and for your glory?

665
00:35:44.085 --> 00:35:45.405
I pray it. Amen.

666
00:35:49.065 --> 00:35:51.445
Church, let's, uh, yeah,

667
00:35:56.455 --> 00:35:59.525
lemme just remind you that uh, every Sunday we have men

668
00:35:59.525 --> 00:36:01.485
and women at the walls in this room,

669
00:36:01.555 --> 00:36:03.645
just on the edges if you need to pray with somebody.

670
00:36:03.645 --> 00:36:06.245
But I just wanna give, I hate

671
00:36:06.245 --> 00:36:07.685
to say it this way, give permission.

672
00:36:07.825 --> 00:36:09.605
Uh, it shouldn't, you don't need my permission.

673
00:36:09.665 --> 00:36:14.405
But there may be some moments here that you,

674
00:36:14.485 --> 00:36:16.725
you just need to say to Jesus, okay, I'm all in.

675
00:36:17.945 --> 00:36:21.645
And, and a, a symbol of that, a physical posture of

676
00:36:21.645 --> 00:36:24.205
that maybe you're getting on your knees right where you are

677
00:36:24.385 --> 00:36:26.245
or, or even coming up here,

678
00:36:26.245 --> 00:36:28.885
there's nothing super spiritual about this room area up

679
00:36:28.885 --> 00:36:32.605
here, but it may just be like, I need to get on my face

680
00:36:32.605 --> 00:36:35.365
before the Lord and say, Jesus, I'm, I'm all in.

681
00:36:36.425 --> 00:36:38.445
Or gather with some people right around you

682
00:36:38.445 --> 00:36:40.285
and say, Hey, can we just pray, appear

683
00:36:40.285 --> 00:36:41.885
or there where you are, or whatever,

684
00:36:41.885 --> 00:36:43.805
and just say, can we just commit to this together?

685
00:36:43.985 --> 00:36:46.245
Can we say, Jesus, you are the Lord

686
00:36:46.305 --> 00:36:48.325
and king of all things including us.

687
00:36:49.185 --> 00:36:51.365
And maybe that's what God wants to do in this time.

688
00:36:53.585 --> 00:36:57.445
So let's just be willing open-handed towards that.

689
00:36:57.655 --> 00:36:59.085
Again, if you need to pray with somebody,

690
00:36:59.085 --> 00:37:01.405
they're at the edges, uh,

691
00:37:01.405 --> 00:37:03.565
or just gather with your buddies right where you are

692
00:37:03.585 --> 00:37:05.165
and just say, God, we are yours.

693
00:37:06.265 --> 00:37:08.485
So I invite you to stand now if you're able,

694
00:37:08.545 --> 00:37:11.725
or Neil if you're able, or respond as we're able

695
00:37:11.725 --> 00:37:13.485
because the Lord is worthy of it.
