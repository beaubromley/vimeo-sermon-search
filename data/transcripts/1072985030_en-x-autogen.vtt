1
00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:21.095
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:22.815
Can I say you're looking pretty good this morning?

3
00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:24.055
I don't know what's different today.

4
00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:25.215
I don't know something about that.

5
00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:30.095
But, uh, as we dress up to honor the end of a sermon series

6
00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:31.575
that we've called, he Shall Reign.

7
00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.375
That does mean we're coming to the end of First Samuel.

8
00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:36.255
And it's just been such an incredible

9
00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:37.655
study for me personally.

10
00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:42.135
I've grown in my affection and knowledge of Jesus and,

11
00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:45.055
and just has been stirring my soul in many ways,

12
00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:46.735
has challenged me in a lot of ways.

13
00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:48.895
And so I'm thankful, uh, that

14
00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:52.215
as we've watched Israel struggle with whether they're going

15
00:00:52.215 --> 00:00:53.775
to allow God to be king

16
00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:57.015
or not, that we've learned a lot about ourselves in

17
00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:01.415
that I pray that we have yet, as much as God was against it

18
00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:05.095
for Israel, choosing to want a king, he was still gracious

19
00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:06.255
to them and kept them

20
00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:09.735
and preserved his people, even through the many failures

21
00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:10.935
of Saul, their first king.

22
00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:12.055
And, and, and,

23
00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:15.655
and God was bringing about the second King David anointing

24
00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:18.335
him and the whole process of how that worked out.

25
00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:21.375
Well today, as we reach the end of one Samuel,

26
00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:25.855
is the final step in that transition from Dave, from Saul

27
00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:27.535
to David as King of Israel.

28
00:01:27.835 --> 00:01:31.175
Uh, we've been seeing this build for, for months now.

29
00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:34.215
As we've walked through one Samuel, we've seen piece

30
00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:36.415
by piece how, uh, from the beginning

31
00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:40.055
with Samuel helping transition from judges to kings, then

32
00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:43.215
to Saul being the king and popular and then declining

33
00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:44.695
and David rising in popularity.

34
00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:45.855
We've seen this all building.

35
00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:48.375
Well, today is the final battle.

36
00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:53.505
This is the final step, the last step for Saul,

37
00:01:53.505 --> 00:01:56.945
where all the prophecies become fulfilled.

38
00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:02.495
And so we're gonna turn to the end of one Samuel chapter 31.

39
00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:04.095
That's where we'll be today.

40
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:09.615
The last chapter one, Samuel 31.

41
00:02:09.635 --> 00:02:11.495
I'm just gonna read the whole thing. It's only 13 verses

42
00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:13.575
to give us the picture of what happens here

43
00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:15.495
and then we'll come back, work through it.

44
00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:18.095
One Samuel 31.

45
00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:22.415
Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel

46
00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:24.815
and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines

47
00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:26.655
and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.

48
00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:29.655
And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons,

49
00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:33.015
and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abab

50
00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:34.815
and Mal Kahua, the sons of Saul.

51
00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:37.645
The battle pressed hard against Saul

52
00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:39.005
and the archers found him,

53
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:41.045
and he was badly wounded by the archers.

54
00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:44.985
And Saul said to his armor bearer, draw your sword

55
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.225
and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come

56
00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:50.225
and thrust me through and mistreat me.

57
00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:53.745
But his armor bearer would not for he feared greatly.

58
00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:57.505
Therefore, Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.

59
00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:00.655
And when his armor bearers, saw that Saul was dead,

60
00:03:00.675 --> 00:03:02.735
he also fell upon his sword and died with him.

61
00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.935
Thus, Saul died and his three sons and his armor bearer

62
00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:10.845
and all his men on the same day together, when the men

63
00:03:10.845 --> 00:03:12.605
of Israel who were on the other side of the valley

64
00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:14.445
and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men

65
00:03:14.445 --> 00:03:17.445
of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead.

66
00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:20.165
They abandoned their cities and fled,

67
00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:23.285
and the Philistines came and lived in them.

68
00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:27.585
The next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain,

69
00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:30.625
they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.

70
00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:32.985
So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor

71
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.745
and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines

72
00:03:35.745 --> 00:03:37.705
to carry the good news to the house

73
00:03:37.765 --> 00:03:39.225
of their idols and to the people.

74
00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:42.585
They put his armor in the temple of aov,

75
00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:45.185
they fastened his body to the wall of Besson.

76
00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:48.505
But when the inhabitants of Jbe, Gilead heard

77
00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:50.265
what the Philistines had done to Saul,

78
00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:51.705
all the valiant men arose

79
00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:53.825
and went all night, took the body of Saul, the body

80
00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:55.745
of his sons from the wall of Betson.

81
00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.065
They came to Jesh and burned them there,

82
00:03:58.525 --> 00:04:01.305
and they took their bones and buried them under the tamaris

83
00:04:01.335 --> 00:04:04.145
tree in Jesh and fasted seven days.

84
00:04:06.085 --> 00:04:10.345
God, this is your word as often hard as it is to

85
00:04:11.565 --> 00:04:12.625
see and read.

86
00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:16.225
We pray that you, your spirit would speak through it today,

87
00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:18.625
that we would see clearly what we need to see, what we need

88
00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:21.145
to learn to be hearers of the word,

89
00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:23.625
but also to be doers of the word more importantly,

90
00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:27.495
and that you would teach us Holy Spirit, what you want us to

91
00:04:28.215 --> 00:04:29.895
remember and, and discover here,

92
00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:32.575
and how you want to transform us

93
00:04:32.575 --> 00:04:33.695
more into the image of Jesus.

94
00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:37.735
We pray that you would. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

95
00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:42.535
So here's the plan for today. As we walk through this.

96
00:04:42.535 --> 00:04:44.575
The whole of one Samuel has been this contrast

97
00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:45.935
between Saul and David, right?

98
00:04:45.955 --> 00:04:48.095
So we're gonna see Saul, we're gonna work through this.

99
00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:49.615
Then we're gonna come back to David A. Little bit,

100
00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:51.575
even though David doesn't show up here in the chapter.

101
00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:53.855
We're gonna come back to David, pick up some things

102
00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:54.895
that we can learn from there.

103
00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:58.255
But also, since one Samuel is intended

104
00:04:58.555 --> 00:05:01.455
to point our minds forward to the Messiah,

105
00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:03.615
we're gonna come back and,

106
00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:07.815
and discover how the Messiah, we know Jesus Christ,

107
00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:12.095
how he is the actual perfect king that we need.

108
00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:14.775
So with three steps, we're gonna look at Saul,

109
00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:15.855
then we're gonna look at David, and

110
00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:16.935
then we'll come back to Jesus.

111
00:05:16.995 --> 00:05:18.975
So hang with me if you get a little lost

112
00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:20.535
or some struggle here, like we'll get

113
00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:22.295
to Jesus here at the end.

114
00:05:23.035 --> 00:05:24.575
And so first we're gonna start with Saul.

115
00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:27.495
This chapter describes his tragic end.

116
00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:30.145
His tragic end.

117
00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:33.345
Last week we looked at how Saul's life is a tragedy.

118
00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:37.545
It's something that was just almost impossible

119
00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:39.825
to think about could have ever happened.

120
00:05:39.825 --> 00:05:41.465
This man falls from the heights.

121
00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:45.025
He fell to the role in, in the end of his life that he,

122
00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:49.705
even the night before this moment of his last battle,

123
00:05:49.895 --> 00:05:52.745
he's meeting with this necromancer, this spirit woman

124
00:05:52.845 --> 00:05:55.425
who was illegal in the land

125
00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:56.585
that he had even kicked out before.

126
00:05:56.585 --> 00:05:58.680
But he, he is such a desperate man that he's looking

127
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.100
for answers in all the wrong places.

128
00:06:00.675 --> 00:06:04.485
He's breaking God's commands, his law to find answers.

129
00:06:04.505 --> 00:06:09.265
That's how far he's fallen, which leads to

130
00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:10.665
what we see here in chapter 31.

131
00:06:11.695 --> 00:06:15.265
This final fulfillment of what God had told Saul

132
00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:18.905
multiple times through Samuel, through other God said

133
00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:20.505
to Saul, you're going to die soon.

134
00:06:22.295 --> 00:06:26.085
Here. It happens. But let's consider why this

135
00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:27.125
was such a tragic death.

136
00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:29.605
Why? Why is this so tragic?

137
00:06:29.615 --> 00:06:32.685
First, it's that Saul died instead of defeated.

138
00:06:34.675 --> 00:06:37.805
Saul died instead of defeated.

139
00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:40.685
Now I realize the grammar's a little funky there.

140
00:06:40.685 --> 00:06:43.365
So let me get to explaining that. What, what I mean by that?

141
00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:47.965
What, what do I mean? So, so think back to chapter nine.

142
00:06:48.225 --> 00:06:52.165
The first time that Saul was chosen to be the king,

143
00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:55.645
God told Samuel something about Saul

144
00:06:55.755 --> 00:06:57.445
that would define his life.

145
00:06:57.545 --> 00:07:00.325
So listen to this. This is first Samuel chapter nine,

146
00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:01.885
verse 16.

147
00:07:02.145 --> 00:07:05.805
God said to Samuel, tomorrow about this time, I'll send

148
00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:07.565
to you a man from the land of Benjamin.

149
00:07:07.705 --> 00:07:09.565
You shall anoint him to be the prince

150
00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:12.045
or king over my people, Israel.

151
00:07:12.985 --> 00:07:16.885
He shall save my people from the hand of the Philistines,

152
00:07:17.665 --> 00:07:20.525
for I've seen my people because their cry has come to me.

153
00:07:22.835 --> 00:07:26.045
That was the original mandate for Saul, was

154
00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:28.085
to defeat the Philistines.

155
00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:33.435
Yet what happens here in chapter 31, he's defeated

156
00:07:33.575 --> 00:07:36.305
by the Philistines, right?

157
00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:39.745
That that was, that was what God had called him to do.

158
00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:42.345
He was supposed to deliver God's people from

159
00:07:42.345 --> 00:07:43.545
the hand of the Philistines.

160
00:07:43.725 --> 00:07:46.945
He ends up dying at the hand of the Philistines.

161
00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:49.185
Instead, not only that, the Philistines

162
00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:52.065
rein invaded the land because of it.

163
00:07:54.275 --> 00:07:58.055
It was almost as if everything reset back to square one,

164
00:07:58.125 --> 00:07:59.215
that Saul was called

165
00:07:59.515 --> 00:08:01.455
to drive the Philistines outta the land.

166
00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:05.295
And in the process of doing so, now it's reverted back

167
00:08:05.915 --> 00:08:07.135
to the way it was to begin with.

168
00:08:08.975 --> 00:08:11.305
They're back in the land. The people are scared.

169
00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:14.625
The script got flipped here.

170
00:08:16.115 --> 00:08:20.405
What Saul was supposed to do ended up dying at their hands.

171
00:08:20.805 --> 00:08:22.805
Terrible consequence of his rebellion.

172
00:08:25.175 --> 00:08:26.475
And so Saul's death was tragic

173
00:08:26.475 --> 00:08:28.555
because it was not what he was supposed to do.

174
00:08:28.555 --> 00:08:29.915
But also it was tragic

175
00:08:29.915 --> 00:08:34.595
because it was inflicted and you saw it here.

176
00:08:34.615 --> 00:08:36.595
His death was self-inflicted.

177
00:08:37.695 --> 00:08:41.195
The text says that he was badly wounded by the archers,

178
00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:43.315
but that didn't kill him.

179
00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.445
Yet. He knew he was so badly wounded.

180
00:08:47.445 --> 00:08:48.805
He knew he, there was no way he was walking

181
00:08:48.805 --> 00:08:49.845
outta this battle alive.

182
00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:52.205
And so he turns to his armor bearer, the man fighting

183
00:08:52.205 --> 00:08:53.405
with him, carrying his stuff.

184
00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:55.405
He turns to him and says, you finished the job.

185
00:08:55.745 --> 00:08:57.685
But that man feared God enough, said,

186
00:08:57.705 --> 00:08:59.085
I'm not touching God's anointed.

187
00:08:59.225 --> 00:09:01.925
And so Saul ended up doing it himself

188
00:09:04.525 --> 00:09:05.635
again, tragic, right?

189
00:09:08.275 --> 00:09:11.615
And notice the Bible nowhere approves of what Saul did here,

190
00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:14.505
it's merely stating the facts.

191
00:09:14.835 --> 00:09:17.585
God's word never commends suicide.

192
00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:22.435
In fact, the Bible views life as a gift from the Lord.

193
00:09:23.465 --> 00:09:26.515
That because we are as humans made in the image of God,

194
00:09:26.655 --> 00:09:31.555
it is unlawful to take life in a prohibited kind of way,

195
00:09:31.555 --> 00:09:33.515
whether that's you or someone else there it.

196
00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:35.875
It's not what God designs us to do.

197
00:09:39.215 --> 00:09:41.235
But what I wanna focus on here is not the

198
00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:42.475
means of Saul's death.

199
00:09:44.455 --> 00:09:47.295
I wanna focus more on the fact that Saul didn't have

200
00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:48.535
to die in the first place.

201
00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:53.765
I mean, just think back after he first turned away from God,

202
00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:56.805
chapter 13, his rebellion against God.

203
00:09:57.065 --> 00:10:00.765
The whole trajectory of his life was a downward spiral,

204
00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:04.095
culminating in this.

205
00:10:04.995 --> 00:10:06.855
Yet it didn't have to be that way.

206
00:10:07.255 --> 00:10:10.315
Remember, like, just think hypothetically,

207
00:10:10.535 --> 00:10:14.555
if Saul at the first step would've turned away from his

208
00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:17.475
rebellion, turned back his heart to God, trusting,

209
00:10:17.475 --> 00:10:18.875
having faith in the Lord,

210
00:10:19.015 --> 00:10:21.035
things could have been very different.

211
00:10:23.075 --> 00:10:24.895
Yet he persisted in his rebellion.

212
00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:28.095
He continued down the path of not worshiping the Lord,

213
00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:31.415
of using and abusing his power, his position for himself.

214
00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:34.615
All of that led to his eventual downfall.

215
00:10:36.165 --> 00:10:40.985
It's tragic, but

216
00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:44.425
there's one more piece to this tragedy that interestingly,

217
00:10:44.485 --> 00:10:47.145
is that Saul's death actually came full circle.

218
00:10:49.305 --> 00:10:51.715
There's some things here that show us that his death was,

219
00:10:51.895 --> 00:10:55.035
was the completion of a circle in the text.

220
00:10:57.005 --> 00:10:58.405
So think back to chapter four.

221
00:10:58.835 --> 00:11:01.165
There's this battle where the Philistines win

222
00:11:01.265 --> 00:11:03.805
and they capture the Ark of the Covenant, the symbol

223
00:11:03.865 --> 00:11:05.965
of God's presence with his people.

224
00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:10.325
Where did they take it? They took it to their temple Dayon.

225
00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:11.285
Remember that was the statue

226
00:11:11.355 --> 00:11:12.605
that the Ark of the Covenant was there.

227
00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:13.885
And they woke up in the morning and it's

228
00:11:13.885 --> 00:11:15.005
laid down face first.

229
00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:17.285
Eventually the next morning, heads cut off all this stuff

230
00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:19.645
that God was like, Hey, Uhuh, this, this isn't gonna work.

231
00:11:21.455 --> 00:11:23.445
Where did they take Saul's armor here in Chapter

232
00:11:23.445 --> 00:11:26.425
31 to their temple.

233
00:11:28.035 --> 00:11:29.775
See, back then it was a symbol that

234
00:11:30.475 --> 00:11:31.935
our God is stronger than yours.

235
00:11:33.155 --> 00:11:36.445
Look, we won. And so we're taking your stuff to our temple.

236
00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:37.765
'cause our God is stronger. Now,

237
00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:39.165
we saw the first time that didn't work.

238
00:11:39.405 --> 00:11:42.325
'cause the Ark of the Covenant, God's presence said, nuh,

239
00:11:42.475 --> 00:11:43.885
this didn't happen in here.

240
00:11:45.345 --> 00:11:46.885
Was God gonna let this one slide?

241
00:11:48.895 --> 00:11:50.155
The armor of Saul, the king

242
00:11:50.155 --> 00:11:52.235
of Israel is now in the temple of asteroids.

243
00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:54.165
Is God gonna let that, let that slide.

244
00:11:54.175 --> 00:11:56.525
We'll, actually, we'll see. Not till this fall.

245
00:11:56.825 --> 00:11:59.045
We go into Second Samuel. When David steps up into

246
00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:01.245
leadership, we'll see how that goes for the Philistines.

247
00:12:01.515 --> 00:12:03.965
Just spoiler alert, they lose Anyway.

248
00:12:04.345 --> 00:12:07.125
Um, but, but just think about that, right?

249
00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:09.485
This is the tragedy. There's parallels here.

250
00:12:11.855 --> 00:12:14.345
There's a cir there's a full circle moment to Eli.

251
00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:16.265
You remember Eli, Eli was the,

252
00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:18.465
the priest at the beginning of the book.

253
00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.825
He was foolish, wasn't a good dad.

254
00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:26.105
He had really, really wicked sons who were also priests.

255
00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:27.785
And he just let 'em do whatever they wanted.

256
00:12:29.005 --> 00:12:31.025
In that same battle, in chapter four,

257
00:12:31.555 --> 00:12:33.825
Eli's sons died in the battle.

258
00:12:34.095 --> 00:12:36.465
When Eli heard about his sons dying

259
00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:37.625
in battle, what did he do?

260
00:12:37.805 --> 00:12:39.185
He fell over dead as well.

261
00:12:39.485 --> 00:12:42.545
It was God's judgment finally coming on.

262
00:12:42.885 --> 00:12:44.705
Eli and his sons that had been promised.

263
00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:51.565
You see parallels here, chapter 31, Saul finally

264
00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:55.565
receives the full judgment of God in his death.

265
00:12:55.785 --> 00:12:59.135
Who dies with him? His sons died.

266
00:13:00.005 --> 00:13:03.695
Even this godly son, Jonathan, David's best friend that,

267
00:13:03.805 --> 00:13:08.615
that they all got caught up in the judgment brought on Saul.

268
00:13:09.905 --> 00:13:12.435
It's a full circle moment that Saul has equated in a sense

269
00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:15.235
with Eli as wicked in both cases.

270
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.245
And there's one more full circle moment here.

271
00:13:19.245 --> 00:13:22.765
It's interesting to watch who was it who courageously came

272
00:13:22.865 --> 00:13:26.445
and, and re recovered the bodies of Saul and his sons

273
00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:27.605
and took them back.

274
00:13:27.605 --> 00:13:29.685
And in a way to try to honor the king

275
00:13:29.765 --> 00:13:31.165
and the anointed one, who was it?

276
00:13:31.225 --> 00:13:34.045
It was the men of Jesh Gilead.

277
00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:36.615
Now, why is that significant?

278
00:13:39.025 --> 00:13:42.555
That was where that, that area of Israel was, where

279
00:13:43.505 --> 00:13:46.155
Saul had accomplished his first military

280
00:13:46.155 --> 00:13:47.595
victory back in chapter 11.

281
00:13:48.855 --> 00:13:52.115
And if you go read chapter 11, Saul in the victory says,

282
00:13:52.175 --> 00:13:54.235
Hey, God brought victory to our land.

283
00:13:54.855 --> 00:13:56.155
God was the one who won this.

284
00:13:56.655 --> 00:13:58.995
And here at the end,

285
00:14:00.205 --> 00:14:03.115
after persistently disobeying God over

286
00:14:03.115 --> 00:14:06.635
and over, not trusting God here he dies

287
00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.555
and is buried in the same location

288
00:14:09.585 --> 00:14:11.355
that he won the first military battle.

289
00:14:14.085 --> 00:14:16.075
First, like how far he's fallen, right?

290
00:14:16.265 --> 00:14:18.275
He's like, God won the battle for us.

291
00:14:18.455 --> 00:14:20.915
And now he doesn't even acknowledge God and loses

292
00:14:20.975 --> 00:14:24.515
and ends up being buried at the same location,

293
00:14:25.075 --> 00:14:27.355
probably under the tree that he used to sit at

294
00:14:27.495 --> 00:14:31.275
and judgment full circle

295
00:14:32.215 --> 00:14:33.235
how far he's fallen.

296
00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:40.015
Now, here's what's interesting.

297
00:14:40.515 --> 00:14:44.555
That's how first Samuel ends. Like it just stops.

298
00:14:46.955 --> 00:14:48.315
Somebody asked me earlier, like, did, did I dress

299
00:14:48.315 --> 00:14:49.355
up for Saul's funeral?

300
00:14:49.495 --> 00:14:50.675
Is that kind of like, that's kinda

301
00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:51.925
what this, this ends like, right?

302
00:14:51.955 --> 00:14:53.405
It's just we're done.

303
00:14:55.535 --> 00:14:58.905
Well, now we have to understand something about the Bible.

304
00:14:59.505 --> 00:15:02.825
Remember this, that, that the Bible we hold in our hands.

305
00:15:03.685 --> 00:15:08.065
It was not originally written in the verse chapter section

306
00:15:08.495 --> 00:15:11.625
book format like we have today, right?

307
00:15:11.685 --> 00:15:12.945
You look at this and

308
00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:14.025
you, you know what it looks like, right?

309
00:15:14.025 --> 00:15:15.025
Maybe you're scrolling through

310
00:15:15.025 --> 00:15:17.025
and you see the verse numbers, chapters, headings,

311
00:15:17.315 --> 00:15:18.385
names, and all these things.

312
00:15:18.535 --> 00:15:21.385
Like it wasn't originally, we built most

313
00:15:21.385 --> 00:15:23.225
of this in the last couple hundred years.

314
00:15:23.445 --> 00:15:25.185
It wasn't originally like that.

315
00:15:25.245 --> 00:15:28.065
The way it was originally put together, specifically first

316
00:15:28.085 --> 00:15:29.625
and second Samuel, was

317
00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:33.145
that it was one whole unit, right?

318
00:15:33.145 --> 00:15:35.145
So it was like Samuel, it wasn't first, second,

319
00:15:35.245 --> 00:15:39.465
it was Samuel, the words of Samuel and you.

320
00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:42.625
So you, you can see how we have separated them out.

321
00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:44.145
But what that means is that in a sense,

322
00:15:44.165 --> 00:15:46.025
the narrative does not stop.

323
00:15:48.505 --> 00:15:50.045
We think First Samuel ends.

324
00:15:50.045 --> 00:15:52.725
Okay, well that kind of cliffed off the end, right?

325
00:15:52.825 --> 00:15:54.885
No, it is a self-contained section.

326
00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:57.605
It ends with Saul's death. But notice something.

327
00:15:57.605 --> 00:15:59.445
Just turn one page to the right.

328
00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:02.165
Maybe just scroll a little bit below.

329
00:16:02.165 --> 00:16:04.485
Maybe it's on the same page you're looking at.

330
00:16:04.715 --> 00:16:08.605
Look at Second Samuel, just the very first verse.

331
00:16:11.535 --> 00:16:14.315
Second Samuel chapter one verse one. Look at this.

332
00:16:16.395 --> 00:16:17.865
After the death of Saul,

333
00:16:18.215 --> 00:16:21.545
when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites,

334
00:16:21.715 --> 00:16:24.585
David remained two days in Ziklag.

335
00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:31.225
There's no break, right? The narrative just continued.

336
00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:33.425
Like it just kept going.

337
00:16:35.585 --> 00:16:37.475
I've said this a few times, said it already this morning

338
00:16:38.095 --> 00:16:40.195
in the fall, starting in August, we're gonna start

339
00:16:40.305 --> 00:16:42.435
with second Samuel and we're gonna continue the story.

340
00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:45.275
We need to see what David was really like as the king.

341
00:16:45.275 --> 00:16:47.795
We're gonna compare and contrast Saul and David again.

342
00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:50.115
But this is, this is gonna come

343
00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:53.795
and we're gonna continue the story starting in August.

344
00:16:53.895 --> 00:16:56.155
But what I thought would be really helpful for us today,

345
00:16:56.205 --> 00:16:58.515
since First Samuel ends kind of weird like that,

346
00:16:59.215 --> 00:17:03.595
to pick up some of how David responded to Saul's death.

347
00:17:04.505 --> 00:17:06.915
Like it's instructive for us to understand like how did,

348
00:17:07.095 --> 00:17:09.635
how did David, this guy who was supposed to be the king,

349
00:17:09.785 --> 00:17:11.715
both anointed, how did David respond

350
00:17:14.505 --> 00:17:15.415
Again, Saul and David

351
00:17:15.775 --> 00:17:16.895
contrast, and we're gonna see it a lot here.

352
00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:19.535
So now what we're gonna see is the kingly response by David.

353
00:17:20.745 --> 00:17:22.735
Again, kingly is not a real word we use

354
00:17:22.735 --> 00:17:23.815
very often, but you'll see what I mean.

355
00:17:23.815 --> 00:17:26.335
Like David acting like the king.

356
00:17:27.475 --> 00:17:30.775
How was his response as the transition's happening?

357
00:17:30.775 --> 00:17:31.975
David's been growing into the role.

358
00:17:32.245 --> 00:17:33.975
David's now stepping into the role

359
00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:35.495
he's proven himself worthy.

360
00:17:35.955 --> 00:17:38.975
How would he respond to Saul's death?

361
00:17:41.765 --> 00:17:43.335
Well, the narrative actually portrays this.

362
00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:45.535
You remember a couple weeks ago we looked at chapter 30.

363
00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:49.805
This is what David was doing around the same time

364
00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:52.125
that Saul was going to the Necromancer

365
00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:53.885
and fighting this battle with the Philistines.

366
00:17:53.915 --> 00:17:56.285
This is what David was doing, chapter 30.

367
00:17:56.425 --> 00:17:58.445
And here in verse one, it repeats that.

368
00:17:58.465 --> 00:18:01.325
It reiterates that, that this is what David was doing.

369
00:18:01.545 --> 00:18:04.005
At the same time, Saul's battling and and dying.

370
00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:09.435
Why is that important? Well, first,

371
00:18:09.435 --> 00:18:12.835
because that puts David somewhere else that he can stand

372
00:18:13.065 --> 00:18:14.435
with clean conscience.

373
00:18:14.585 --> 00:18:19.275
That he had nothing to do with Saul's death, right?

374
00:18:19.275 --> 00:18:22.075
He, he was clean. Nobody could accuse him of anything.

375
00:18:22.105 --> 00:18:23.875
He's over here fighting the Amalekites

376
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:25.955
and Ziklag like he, he's over there,

377
00:18:26.255 --> 00:18:28.315
Saul's over there fighting the Philistines.

378
00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:29.555
David had nothing to do with it.

379
00:18:30.865 --> 00:18:33.365
Nobody could accuse him that he was manipulative

380
00:18:33.385 --> 00:18:35.245
and trying to fight battles for himself.

381
00:18:35.305 --> 00:18:37.365
He was just doing what he was called to do.

382
00:18:37.955 --> 00:18:40.525
Saul died because God judged him.

383
00:18:42.715 --> 00:18:44.935
But it also proves, second, it proves

384
00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:47.655
that David was truly acting like the king.

385
00:18:49.805 --> 00:18:51.485
'cause Saul's fighting battles for himself.

386
00:18:51.515 --> 00:18:52.845
He's trying to preserve his kingdom.

387
00:18:53.135 --> 00:18:55.725
David over here, he's defending people.

388
00:18:56.035 --> 00:18:57.565
He's delivering people from slavery.

389
00:18:58.115 --> 00:18:59.805
He's providing financial help

390
00:18:59.825 --> 00:19:01.125
for people who aren't even at the battle.

391
00:19:01.355 --> 00:19:05.745
He's doing things that kings do. He's acting like a king.

392
00:19:05.775 --> 00:19:09.505
He's proving himself worthy As the king.

393
00:19:11.425 --> 00:19:15.595
But here's what we can't miss. We can't miss that.

394
00:19:15.595 --> 00:19:20.315
That all happened because David had finally fully

395
00:19:21.075 --> 00:19:22.075
surrendered to the Lord.

396
00:19:24.655 --> 00:19:25.735
Remember, David has this habit.

397
00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:27.615
We've seen this throughout one Samuel, right?

398
00:19:27.615 --> 00:19:28.975
David has this habit of kind of like,

399
00:19:30.355 --> 00:19:31.735
I'm gonna use my own cunning ability.

400
00:19:31.835 --> 00:19:33.575
I'm gonna use my own speaking ability.

401
00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:34.775
I'm gonna act a certain way,

402
00:19:34.775 --> 00:19:37.695
or I'm gonna get these people on my side to try

403
00:19:37.695 --> 00:19:39.535
to manipulate the circumstances so

404
00:19:39.535 --> 00:19:40.895
that he gets what he wants.

405
00:19:41.075 --> 00:19:43.175
And what it brought over and over again was trouble.

406
00:19:45.305 --> 00:19:46.995
Trouble for him, trouble for others.

407
00:19:47.215 --> 00:19:50.315
He kept trying himself to, to solve the equation.

408
00:19:50.735 --> 00:19:54.955
It brought problems when he finally said, God,

409
00:19:55.105 --> 00:19:59.215
this is yours, chapter 30, God, this is yours.

410
00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:04.095
What happened? God brought victory.

411
00:20:05.415 --> 00:20:09.835
God showed up to bring the victory that he needed.

412
00:20:09.905 --> 00:20:12.955
When David trusted him to work it out, God said, I got you.

413
00:20:16.495 --> 00:20:19.025
Well, that leads to a pretty clear application question

414
00:20:19.025 --> 00:20:20.105
for us today, doesn't it?

415
00:20:23.295 --> 00:20:26.465
Will you trust God to resolve your problems?

416
00:20:31.295 --> 00:20:33.265
Will you trust God

417
00:20:34.845 --> 00:20:38.145
To resolve the problems you're facing day to day?

418
00:20:38.565 --> 00:20:40.585
Big picture, small picture, whatever it is.

419
00:20:40.585 --> 00:20:43.505
Will you trust that God is going to resolve them?

420
00:20:43.765 --> 00:20:47.445
Or will you try to take matters into your own hands?

421
00:20:50.155 --> 00:20:51.575
Now you have a responsibility to act

422
00:20:51.575 --> 00:20:54.135
and what God says to do, yes, I'm not saying you don't.

423
00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:56.255
You sit on the couch and God does everything I'm saying.

424
00:20:56.635 --> 00:20:59.815
You try to control the situation.

425
00:20:59.835 --> 00:21:01.975
If I've learned anything in my life, if,

426
00:21:02.275 --> 00:21:04.695
if we've learned anything through one Samuel, it's

427
00:21:04.695 --> 00:21:08.655
that when we choose to be the king of our own lives,

428
00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:10.295
it goes south really fast.

429
00:21:12.935 --> 00:21:15.585
When we try to take control, when we try to,

430
00:21:15.645 --> 00:21:18.865
to allow our own abilities, resources to manage

431
00:21:18.865 --> 00:21:22.065
and manipulate and control, it goes bad.

432
00:21:22.085 --> 00:21:23.465
But if we stop

433
00:21:24.405 --> 00:21:28.745
and allow God to reign as king as he is,

434
00:21:29.165 --> 00:21:31.945
things begin to work a little better.

435
00:21:33.185 --> 00:21:37.925
Not perfectly, but things work out exactly as God wants them

436
00:21:37.925 --> 00:21:39.005
to work out for us.

437
00:21:39.065 --> 00:21:41.365
He solves the problems for us.

438
00:21:41.625 --> 00:21:42.965
We get in trouble when we try

439
00:21:42.965 --> 00:21:44.765
to take charge when he's in charge.

440
00:21:45.105 --> 00:21:46.965
That's his plan.

441
00:21:50.105 --> 00:21:52.565
So will you trust that God's gonna work it out

442
00:21:52.585 --> 00:21:54.285
or will you try to take it yourself?

443
00:21:54.385 --> 00:21:57.605
That's a day by day moment by moment.

444
00:21:58.005 --> 00:21:59.485
Question every one of us has to answer.

445
00:22:01.865 --> 00:22:03.615
David shows us what happens when we do

446
00:22:03.635 --> 00:22:05.015
answer that question with faith.

447
00:22:08.425 --> 00:22:09.965
So David responded like a king

448
00:22:10.615 --> 00:22:14.645
first in the way he trusted God, allowing that to happen,

449
00:22:14.745 --> 00:22:15.885
he followed God's plan.

450
00:22:15.885 --> 00:22:18.485
He ends up in Ziklag instead of at Gilboa.

451
00:22:18.485 --> 00:22:21.205
And he's not accused of He He's, he's trusting God

452
00:22:21.205 --> 00:22:23.525
and he's obeying God and it works well.

453
00:22:25.305 --> 00:22:27.925
But here's the second way that he responded like a king

454
00:22:28.225 --> 00:22:31.935
to all of this, is that he was grieved

455
00:22:32.995 --> 00:22:37.425
by Saul's death, the anointed one.

456
00:22:37.425 --> 00:22:39.425
Both of them were anointed by God as the king.

457
00:22:40.115 --> 00:22:42.585
David knew that David treated him like that.

458
00:22:42.665 --> 00:22:43.905
I can't touch the Lord's anointed.

459
00:22:44.005 --> 00:22:47.945
And yet, when Saul died, he was deeply

460
00:22:48.495 --> 00:22:49.585
grieved by it.

461
00:22:52.975 --> 00:22:55.495
Continue down in Second Samuel chapter one,

462
00:22:55.495 --> 00:22:56.815
look at verses 11 and 12.

463
00:22:58.445 --> 00:23:01.015
This is when David heard of Saul's death

464
00:23:01.035 --> 00:23:04.975
for the first time, verse 11.

465
00:23:04.975 --> 00:23:07.815
Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them.

466
00:23:07.815 --> 00:23:09.055
That's a sign of grief.

467
00:23:09.435 --> 00:23:12.615
And so did all the men who were with him, and they mourned

468
00:23:12.635 --> 00:23:15.775
and wept and fasted until evening for Saul

469
00:23:15.775 --> 00:23:17.095
and for Jonathan, his son,

470
00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:19.495
and for the people of the Lord, for the house of Israel,

471
00:23:19.495 --> 00:23:21.655
because they had fallen by the sword

472
00:23:23.595 --> 00:23:24.925
like a deep grief, right?

473
00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:29.795
It wasn't just a few tears shed, it wasn't just kinda like,

474
00:23:29.795 --> 00:23:31.235
ah, that's, that's tough.

475
00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:33.315
But it was physical actions.

476
00:23:34.095 --> 00:23:36.115
You can imagine he's even throwing ashes on his head.

477
00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:40.845
That was a sign of grief that they're mourning, deeply

478
00:23:41.955 --> 00:23:44.085
wounded by the fact that Saul and Jonathan

479
00:23:44.085 --> 00:23:45.445
and the men had had died.

480
00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:48.125
In fact, David, we know David's a great musician, right?

481
00:23:48.295 --> 00:23:50.205
Wrote us a ton of the Psalms.

482
00:23:51.185 --> 00:23:55.205
He writes a song of lament about this whole situation.

483
00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:59.535
You can go read it later in the second half of chapter one.

484
00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:04.295
It's just his profound pouring out of lament of lamentation,

485
00:24:04.395 --> 00:24:08.135
of grief, of mourning over this situation.

486
00:24:08.915 --> 00:24:11.055
In fact, three times it repeats the refrain,

487
00:24:11.235 --> 00:24:14.175
how the mighty have fallen, how the mighty have fallen,

488
00:24:14.395 --> 00:24:18.125
how the mighty have fallen like this

489
00:24:19.405 --> 00:24:24.285
monumental king of Israel, one king, such high status,

490
00:24:24.715 --> 00:24:28.575
such hope, how the mighty have fallen

491
00:24:29.975 --> 00:24:32.825
both in death and in the way they followed.

492
00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:34.745
God, it it's profound.

493
00:24:36.115 --> 00:24:38.965
David's wrestling with the loss and he's writing this song

494
00:24:38.965 --> 00:24:40.605
and it's really, really deep.

495
00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:42.885
But let's be clear about something here. Think about this.

496
00:24:44.395 --> 00:24:46.415
Who was David writing that about?

497
00:24:49.335 --> 00:24:51.595
He was writing it about Jonathan, his best friend,

498
00:24:51.785 --> 00:24:52.795
like the man who stood

499
00:24:52.795 --> 00:24:54.395
with him when nobody else would, right?

500
00:24:54.415 --> 00:24:55.715
That's who he's writing it about.

501
00:24:55.745 --> 00:24:57.915
He's craved over his best friend dying.

502
00:24:58.015 --> 00:24:59.475
Of course he would be.

503
00:24:59.775 --> 00:25:04.035
But notice he's also responding like this about

504
00:25:04.625 --> 00:25:08.615
Saul, the one who

505
00:25:09.175 --> 00:25:13.995
multiple times tried to kill David, who

506
00:25:14.015 --> 00:25:15.715
for years had him on the run,

507
00:25:17.175 --> 00:25:20.115
who hunted David like he was a wild animal.

508
00:25:21.495 --> 00:25:24.965
David is writing this song. David is responding.

509
00:25:24.965 --> 00:25:29.725
David is grieving about a man who was trying to kill him,

510
00:25:29.985 --> 00:25:34.485
and now that man's dead and David is deeply impacted.

511
00:25:34.485 --> 00:25:36.205
There's a second question here, right?

512
00:25:40.265 --> 00:25:41.645
Can you love your enemies like that?

513
00:25:45.615 --> 00:25:49.635
Can you love your enemies like that?

514
00:25:51.875 --> 00:25:53.915
I mean, just ask yourself the question you.

515
00:25:53.935 --> 00:25:55.995
You can think of the person that's your enemy, right?

516
00:25:56.275 --> 00:25:57.995
Whatever. Some may project out.

517
00:25:58.275 --> 00:26:01.075
Somebody who's trying to take your very life over and over

518
00:26:01.075 --> 00:26:02.115
and you're running in fear.

519
00:26:02.175 --> 00:26:03.915
You're living in threat all the time.

520
00:26:04.175 --> 00:26:05.995
You find out that that person's dead.

521
00:26:08.475 --> 00:26:12.955
How would you respond? Like in a sense,

522
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:15.435
I think most of us would probably be like celebrating.

523
00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:19.435
We'd be happy with man. Woo. Finally free of that mess.

524
00:26:19.465 --> 00:26:21.915
Like, oh, thank you for the victory you gave me.

525
00:26:21.975 --> 00:26:23.515
God, man, I'm so thankful

526
00:26:23.545 --> 00:26:24.955
that I don't have that problem anymore.

527
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.995
Wow, I am so much more free.

528
00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:31.775
Would you respond that way?

529
00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:36.865
It's kinda like how Saul,

530
00:26:36.865 --> 00:26:38.465
imagine if David, imagine if it's flipped.

531
00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:42.235
Imagine if David was the one who died, Saul,

532
00:26:42.645 --> 00:26:46.405
whose laser focused on eliminating everyone who opposed him.

533
00:26:47.225 --> 00:26:48.645
How would he respond? He'd be like, yes.

534
00:26:48.645 --> 00:26:51.805
Finally, I got him, man, he'd been chasing him for years.

535
00:26:52.085 --> 00:26:53.085
I finally got him.

536
00:26:54.755 --> 00:26:57.925
David's gone. The problem is solved.

537
00:27:01.145 --> 00:27:02.215
Would You respond like that?

538
00:27:05.105 --> 00:27:09.645
Or Do you respond to those

539
00:27:09.705 --> 00:27:11.125
who oppose you more like

540
00:27:11.125 --> 00:27:13.705
David, who

541
00:27:17.025 --> 00:27:20.235
grieved, mourned the death

542
00:27:20.735 --> 00:27:21.735
Of his Oppressor?

543
00:27:25.305 --> 00:27:27.485
Do you respond like Stephen?

544
00:27:28.845 --> 00:27:31.245
Remember Stephen in Acts chapter seven,

545
00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:35.965
the first Christian martyr, he stands up in front

546
00:27:35.965 --> 00:27:39.125
of the religious elites and he, he's asked these questions.

547
00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:40.165
They're like, why are you doing this?

548
00:27:40.165 --> 00:27:42.525
Why do you believe this? And Stephen's like, Hey, listen,

549
00:27:42.525 --> 00:27:43.725
lemme tell you why I believe this.

550
00:27:43.725 --> 00:27:45.325
Because he goes back to the very beginning

551
00:27:45.325 --> 00:27:48.565
and tells him throughout the entire history of Israel,

552
00:27:48.785 --> 00:27:49.965
and he walks through and he says,

553
00:27:49.975 --> 00:27:52.125
Jesus is the fulfillment of all of that.

554
00:27:52.385 --> 00:27:53.805
That's why I worship him.

555
00:27:53.945 --> 00:27:56.405
He died and resurrected and you killed him.

556
00:27:56.585 --> 00:27:59.285
But I'm worshiping him as a resurrected savior.

557
00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:01.165
And what they do in response

558
00:28:02.425 --> 00:28:04.565
is they start throwing heavy stones on him

559
00:28:04.585 --> 00:28:06.325
to crush him to death.

560
00:28:08.965 --> 00:28:10.905
And As he is being

561
00:28:11.865 --> 00:28:14.105
Executed, He looks to heaven

562
00:28:14.285 --> 00:28:16.385
and he says, father, forgive them.

563
00:28:16.575 --> 00:28:17.905
They don't know what they're doing.

564
00:28:22.275 --> 00:28:23.275
Do you respond like that

565
00:28:25.415 --> 00:28:26.415
To your enemy?

566
00:28:29.725 --> 00:28:31.945
Listen, there is only one way

567
00:28:33.215 --> 00:28:35.505
that we can respond like that.

568
00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:38.305
There's only one way it is possible for you

569
00:28:38.565 --> 00:28:41.185
and for me to love our enemies like that.

570
00:28:41.185 --> 00:28:44.865
There is no other way apart from being transformed

571
00:28:45.125 --> 00:28:46.305
by the life, death,

572
00:28:46.325 --> 00:28:48.865
and resurrection of Jesus Christ for you.

573
00:28:49.165 --> 00:28:53.985
The one who on the cross himself looked at his executors

574
00:28:54.165 --> 00:28:56.065
and said, father, forgive them

575
00:28:56.085 --> 00:28:57.145
for they don't know what they're doing.

576
00:28:58.405 --> 00:29:00.975
There's only one way. It's only through.

577
00:29:00.975 --> 00:29:04.255
There's only one way we can avoid a life of vengeance.

578
00:29:04.255 --> 00:29:06.975
There's only one way we can avoid an eye

579
00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:08.455
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

580
00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:11.575
That's the way the world works, right? Revenge, vengeance.

581
00:29:11.575 --> 00:29:15.415
That's how the way of our flesh pushes us towards that.

582
00:29:15.415 --> 00:29:19.135
There's only one way we can sacrifice for others is

583
00:29:19.135 --> 00:29:21.895
through Jesus Christ who sacrificed for us.

584
00:29:24.315 --> 00:29:26.135
See, when you place your faith in him,

585
00:29:26.355 --> 00:29:31.095
he takes away your self focused heart of stone.

586
00:29:31.235 --> 00:29:33.695
That's only about vengeance. It's only about self.

587
00:29:33.915 --> 00:29:36.695
He takes that away, gives you a heart of flesh

588
00:29:36.795 --> 00:29:38.135
that's now focused on him.

589
00:29:38.325 --> 00:29:41.095
It's a new heart able to now love your enemies

590
00:29:41.265 --> 00:29:43.405
and to love him with all that you are.

591
00:29:45.525 --> 00:29:48.145
And really, listen. That's what the whole book

592
00:29:48.325 --> 00:29:50.345
of one Samuels has been pointing us to.

593
00:29:52.245 --> 00:29:53.465
And Jesus would agree with this

594
00:29:55.095 --> 00:29:58.985
because as much as we've seen this contrast between Saul

595
00:29:58.985 --> 00:30:02.485
and David, and we've learned a lot from that, yes,

596
00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:05.725
but neither of them was perfect.

597
00:30:07.015 --> 00:30:08.505
Neither of them were a perfect king.

598
00:30:08.505 --> 00:30:10.065
We'll see it, especially in the fall with dead.

599
00:30:10.065 --> 00:30:13.585
Neither were a perfect king that can sustain

600
00:30:14.225 --> 00:30:15.945
handling our salvation.

601
00:30:16.285 --> 00:30:20.675
So really what this is pointing us to, for them forward,

602
00:30:20.815 --> 00:30:22.355
for us, we know now,

603
00:30:22.575 --> 00:30:25.955
but it's pointing us towards someone who's coming later

604
00:30:26.255 --> 00:30:29.995
to David's greater son, who would be the king once

605
00:30:30.255 --> 00:30:33.795
and for all the Messiah whose name is Jesus Christ.

606
00:30:35.055 --> 00:30:37.515
That's what first Samuel points us to.

607
00:30:37.615 --> 00:30:39.075
And here's how we're gonna get there. Watch this.

608
00:30:39.075 --> 00:30:40.355
This is interesting exercise.

609
00:30:40.445 --> 00:30:42.955
We're not just gonna contrast Saul and David.

610
00:30:44.545 --> 00:30:46.695
Let's contrast Saul and Jesus.

611
00:30:48.455 --> 00:30:53.025
Saul the fallen king with Jesus, the perfect king.

612
00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:56.385
And here's what this will do. It'll show us

613
00:30:56.895 --> 00:31:00.825
even more clearly the gospel hope we

614
00:31:00.935 --> 00:31:02.145
have in him.

615
00:31:03.465 --> 00:31:05.715
Like this is what we're gonna look at the gospel, hope

616
00:31:06.185 --> 00:31:08.675
through the lens of contrast.

617
00:31:09.205 --> 00:31:11.915
We'll watch this gospel hope take off.

618
00:31:11.915 --> 00:31:14.035
We're gonna look at parallels here. This is so interesting.

619
00:31:14.035 --> 00:31:17.065
Watch this one, Saul. Think.

620
00:31:17.065 --> 00:31:18.545
Think about Saul, especially at the end.

621
00:31:18.955 --> 00:31:21.865
Think about Saul's life. Where did he die?

622
00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:26.735
He died here. Chapter 31 says on Mount Gilboa.

623
00:31:27.725 --> 00:31:30.375
That was his final life breath.

624
00:31:31.965 --> 00:31:33.505
But then you think about Saul, all of

625
00:31:33.505 --> 00:31:35.905
what we learned about him, he was a selfish king.

626
00:31:36.765 --> 00:31:40.345
He was living and dying even for himself.

627
00:31:41.285 --> 00:31:44.465
It was all to try to preserve his own kingdom.

628
00:31:44.775 --> 00:31:46.505
That was Saul's focus.

629
00:31:46.565 --> 00:31:48.145
He never came to grips with the reality

630
00:31:48.145 --> 00:31:50.425
that David was the one to replace him.

631
00:31:50.455 --> 00:31:52.465
That God had said, here's what's going to happen.

632
00:31:52.655 --> 00:31:53.905
Saul could never accept it.

633
00:31:55.275 --> 00:31:59.455
He was so focused on himself clinging to this throne

634
00:31:59.755 --> 00:32:00.895
and his own little kingdom.

635
00:32:01.115 --> 00:32:02.975
That's what he wanted more than anything else.

636
00:32:03.445 --> 00:32:07.175
That was Saul. But now contrast that with Jesus.

637
00:32:08.745 --> 00:32:12.615
Watch this. Jesus lived his whole life perfectly.

638
00:32:12.625 --> 00:32:15.015
Watch this. Where did Jesus die?

639
00:32:16.695 --> 00:32:18.205
Mount Gha

640
00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:23.105
as a selfless king

641
00:32:25.705 --> 00:32:30.125
for others, wanting to

642
00:32:31.195 --> 00:32:33.325
magnify his father's kingdom.

643
00:32:35.575 --> 00:32:37.685
Right? Do you see this? You see the parallels here.

644
00:32:37.945 --> 00:32:40.565
The the fallen king, imperfect king Saul

645
00:32:40.705 --> 00:32:43.445
and all of those things, and the perfect king Jesus.

646
00:32:43.665 --> 00:32:45.045
You see how the parallels work.

647
00:32:45.145 --> 00:32:47.205
I'm not just making this stuff up. Let me show you.

648
00:32:47.255 --> 00:32:50.605
God's word says all of these things. John 17, four.

649
00:32:50.815 --> 00:32:52.365
Jesus prayed to his father.

650
00:32:52.625 --> 00:32:55.565
He said, I glorified you on earth

651
00:32:56.585 --> 00:32:58.605
having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.

652
00:32:58.785 --> 00:33:01.285
He was focused on his father's kingdom

653
00:33:01.615 --> 00:33:03.085
above his own kingdom.

654
00:33:03.475 --> 00:33:04.605
Mark 10 45.

655
00:33:04.865 --> 00:33:08.285
The son of man did not come to be served,

656
00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:12.205
but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.

657
00:33:12.345 --> 00:33:14.685
He wasn't here for himself. He was here for others.

658
00:33:16.575 --> 00:33:20.765
In Romans five, eight, God demonstrates his own love

659
00:33:20.985 --> 00:33:24.565
for us in this, that while we were still sinners,

660
00:33:24.745 --> 00:33:27.885
Christ died for us enemies.

661
00:33:29.435 --> 00:33:34.215
Christ died for his enemies. God showed his love in that.

662
00:33:34.305 --> 00:33:35.935
Again, Saul died.

663
00:33:36.105 --> 00:33:39.575
Mount Gilboa, a selfish king for himself, trying

664
00:33:39.575 --> 00:33:42.255
to preserve his own kingdom, which really, listen,

665
00:33:42.355 --> 00:33:43.575
that's every one of us, right?

666
00:33:45.175 --> 00:33:47.485
We're all about ourselves. We're all about our own kingdom.

667
00:33:47.655 --> 00:33:50.725
We're all about dying for self, not for anyone else.

668
00:33:50.725 --> 00:33:52.045
Like this is how we are to do this.

669
00:33:52.145 --> 00:33:55.565
We, we are a flesh love being like Saul.

670
00:33:55.745 --> 00:33:59.925
But Jesus died on Mount Gha, a selfless king

671
00:34:00.305 --> 00:34:03.405
for others, wanting to preserve his father's

672
00:34:03.405 --> 00:34:05.205
and magnify his father's kingdom.

673
00:34:05.505 --> 00:34:08.565
Is that not good news that we have a perfect king like that?

674
00:34:08.705 --> 00:34:13.195
Who does it for us? Like we have a savior

675
00:34:13.425 --> 00:34:14.635
king, not just a king.

676
00:34:14.735 --> 00:34:19.355
We have a savior king who paid with his blood, our penalty

677
00:34:19.585 --> 00:34:22.115
that we, our debt that we deserve to owe,

678
00:34:22.225 --> 00:34:23.395
that we should pay for.

679
00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:26.555
God paid it through his son's life.

680
00:34:26.575 --> 00:34:28.835
You know that like in our place for our good,

681
00:34:28.855 --> 00:34:31.515
we have someone who looked at us,

682
00:34:33.285 --> 00:34:36.285
his enemies and said,

683
00:34:36.485 --> 00:34:38.365
I want him in my family.

684
00:34:38.765 --> 00:34:40.445
I want her in my family.

685
00:34:40.465 --> 00:34:42.125
And I'm gonna pay for them to be in my family

686
00:34:42.435 --> 00:34:44.805
with my son's life.

687
00:34:45.955 --> 00:34:47.125
Like that's love folks.

688
00:34:47.755 --> 00:34:52.405
That is mega, super above the chart love.

689
00:34:54.595 --> 00:34:58.735
That's why he did it. We could never pay our own penalty.

690
00:35:00.115 --> 00:35:02.015
We would deserve wrath. We deserved it.

691
00:35:02.075 --> 00:35:04.655
We could never pay the price to get out of that.

692
00:35:04.875 --> 00:35:07.255
And we would fall short. You would fall short. I fall short.

693
00:35:07.265 --> 00:35:09.255
Every one of us fall short in this.

694
00:35:09.255 --> 00:35:12.375
There's only one way to the father

695
00:35:14.205 --> 00:35:17.095
through this perfect savior king that we have

696
00:35:17.355 --> 00:35:19.375
who paid it all for us.

697
00:35:23.325 --> 00:35:24.585
And again, you know why he did it.

698
00:35:25.645 --> 00:35:28.105
He did it because he loves you

699
00:35:29.775 --> 00:35:33.665
immensely as his enemy.

700
00:35:34.605 --> 00:35:38.765
He loves you. And now you are a part of his family by faith.

701
00:35:41.895 --> 00:35:43.805
Let's reflect on that now, if you would bow your heads

702
00:35:43.805 --> 00:35:47.245
with me and close your eyes just to focus our hearts on

703
00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:49.325
what he wants to do in us.

704
00:35:49.385 --> 00:35:49.605
Now,

705
00:35:55.025 --> 00:35:56.925
as the worship leaders are coming out, we're,

706
00:35:58.935 --> 00:36:01.765
we're at this place with this hard text, this hard passage,

707
00:36:01.985 --> 00:36:04.445
but, but really,

708
00:36:07.355 --> 00:36:11.365
have you ever seen the love of God like that before?

709
00:36:16.415 --> 00:36:17.605
Maybe you've been to church, maybe

710
00:36:17.605 --> 00:36:18.645
you've been a good person.

711
00:36:18.775 --> 00:36:20.885
Maybe you're around things

712
00:36:21.305 --> 00:36:22.685
enough that you think you're good.

713
00:36:22.745 --> 00:36:25.205
You think you're good enough, you think you've done enough.

714
00:36:26.275 --> 00:36:28.365
There's no way to be good enough.

715
00:36:30.525 --> 00:36:32.825
You have to be perfect. You've already blown it,

716
00:36:36.205 --> 00:36:40.625
and yet you have a substitute who was perfect

717
00:36:41.725 --> 00:36:46.185
for you and his willing

718
00:36:46.605 --> 00:36:48.225
self-sacrifice for your good,

719
00:36:49.215 --> 00:36:50.625
even when you don't deserve it.

720
00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:52.625
Even when you could never pay him back.

721
00:36:53.005 --> 00:36:54.985
That's his love for you.

722
00:36:56.245 --> 00:36:58.065
Do you grasp that?

723
00:36:59.005 --> 00:37:01.265
You understand that you feel that

724
00:37:02.435 --> 00:37:04.305
maybe you've never rested in that love before

725
00:37:06.645 --> 00:37:09.385
and you're seeing today like this is, this is what I need.

726
00:37:09.585 --> 00:37:12.505
I I I can't make it. I I know I can. I'm exhausted.

727
00:37:12.745 --> 00:37:15.985
I need that love. Simply run to him right now.

728
00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:20.025
Jesus, I need you. I'm, I know I'm a sinner.

729
00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:23.865
I know I can't make it. I need you. You did it all for me.

730
00:37:24.855 --> 00:37:25.345
Save me.

731
00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:34.505
We'd love to hear about that if you right now do that.

732
00:37:34.605 --> 00:37:38.265
But, but also maybe, maybe you're like me this morning, I,

733
00:37:38.305 --> 00:37:39.705
I woke up kind

734
00:37:39.705 --> 00:37:43.785
of just not really excited about that.

735
00:37:43.785 --> 00:37:47.545
Love of God wasn't wrong, wasn't bad.

736
00:37:47.825 --> 00:37:51.225
I wasn't doing anything. I was just kind of lost

737
00:37:51.295 --> 00:37:52.585
that affection.

738
00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:57.065
And it wasn't until this morning first service

739
00:37:57.135 --> 00:37:59.665
that I was able to preach this gospel to myself

740
00:38:01.765 --> 00:38:02.785
and read it and hear it and

741
00:38:02.785 --> 00:38:04.065
understand it and sing it and all that.

742
00:38:04.135 --> 00:38:06.825
Like that's what began to stir my affection.

743
00:38:06.825 --> 00:38:08.425
So this service has been totally different

744
00:38:08.425 --> 00:38:09.425
for me than the first one was.

745
00:38:10.485 --> 00:38:12.105
And maybe that's what you walked in here with.

746
00:38:13.885 --> 00:38:16.545
You don't know you like I I just don't feel it right now.

747
00:38:16.735 --> 00:38:18.745
Okay? Ask, come to him right now.

748
00:38:18.965 --> 00:38:22.705
Ask God to just stir your affections for him right now.

749
00:38:23.445 --> 00:38:26.585
You've heard it and we need it over and over and over again.

750
00:38:26.645 --> 00:38:29.265
It sounds repetitive. We preach the same message every week.

751
00:38:29.565 --> 00:38:31.465
We need it every week.

752
00:38:34.855 --> 00:38:36.045
Just stir your God.

753
00:38:36.275 --> 00:38:39.325
Restore to me as Psalm 51 says, restore to me the joy

754
00:38:39.665 --> 00:38:40.765
of your salvation.

755
00:38:40.765 --> 00:38:43.765
That I would then return that joy with love

756
00:38:43.785 --> 00:38:45.205
for you and love in every way.

757
00:38:45.395 --> 00:38:47.565
Just pray that to him as we sing this.

758
00:38:48.745 --> 00:38:51.525
Be reminded of his love for you, that you could be able

759
00:38:51.545 --> 00:38:53.245
to love him back.
