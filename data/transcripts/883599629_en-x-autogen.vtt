I love you?

4
00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:18.595
Oh, she is.

5
00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:23.695
I'll be brave. I'll let

6
00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:33.515

00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:01.365
Don't love you.

00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:19.725

00:02:20.725 --> 00:02:22.245

I'll find you.

17
00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:31.565
It is amazing how you can speak right

18
00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:39.905
without saying

19
00:04:42.085 --> 00:04:43.085
You Light up.

20
00:04:57.495 --> 00:04:57.845

Know And you need me.

24
00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:13.675
There's the truth in your eyes saying you'll never

25
00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:14.925
Leave me.

26
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:20.075
The of your hand says, you catch me wherever

27
00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:21.035
I fall

all

29
00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:45.345
Long. I

30
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.435
can hear people talking.

31
00:05:54.945 --> 00:05:59.945
When crowd,

32
00:06:11.065 --> 00:06:13.165
What's Between your

33
00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:14.655
Heart?

34
00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:21.525
A smile On your face? Lets know that you

35
00:06:21.575 --> 00:06:23.485
Leave me. There's a truth

36
00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:25.365
In your eyes Saying

37
00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:27.845
You'll never leave me.

38
00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:34.285
Your head says, you can't Forever. I fall.

39
00:06:42.955 --> 00:06:43.955
When you say

40
00:07:23.205 --> 00:07:23.625
You'll,

41
00:07:35.715 --> 00:07:35.935
you

42
00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:49.605
Save

43
00:09:15.915 --> 00:09:16.115
anything

44
00:09:57.745 --> 00:09:58.245
by you,

45
00:10:15.195 --> 00:10:15.415
the

46
00:11:37.035 --> 00:11:37.615
you do.

47
00:12:55.295 --> 00:12:59.195
First thing that I'm gonna do, spread my wings.

48
00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:17.765
When

49
00:13:17.925 --> 00:13:19.245
I get where I going,

50
00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:23.725
There'll be Only

51
00:13:23.935 --> 00:13:28.725
Happy. I'll

52
00:13:28.815 --> 00:13:31.885
Share and struggles I have carried

53
00:13:32.105 --> 00:13:34.245
All these years Now

54
00:14:15.615 --> 00:14:20.325
where I'm going, there'll

55
00:14:27.355 --> 00:14:27.845
happy's,

56
00:16:36.105 --> 00:16:37.275
Sometimes late.

57
00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:43.815
I you can watch her sleep.

58
00:16:49.545 --> 00:16:51.575
She's lost in peaceful dreams.

59
00:16:51.835 --> 00:16:55.095
So I turn out the lights and lay there

60
00:17:00.015 --> 00:17:01.155
and the thought cross.

61
00:17:05.945 --> 00:17:09.635
I never in morning

62
00:17:17.445 --> 00:17:18.265
the way I,

63
00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:31.235
my true

64
00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:47.045
much means.

65
00:18:52.655 --> 00:18:56.515
And that circumstance where there's no second chance,

66
00:19:22.095 --> 00:19:22.315
She

67
00:19:33.665 --> 00:19:34.665
Must.

68
00:20:20.975 --> 00:20:22.895
I was young. So

69
00:21:33.515 --> 00:21:37.205
Disassemble, we came

70
00:21:37.605 --> 00:21:41.925
together broke.

71
00:22:48.815 --> 00:22:49.555
You may be seated.

72
00:22:57.525 --> 00:23:01.455
Well welcome and thank you guys for all coming today.

73
00:23:02.515 --> 00:23:04.815
Um, we appreciate you joining us

74
00:23:06.115 --> 00:23:08.055
in this celebration of life

75
00:23:09.795 --> 00:23:13.735
and equally of legacy of my dad, Gary Henley.

76
00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:18.735
So by, uh, on the behalf of Peggy, myself,

77
00:23:18.755 --> 00:23:21.095
and our entire family, again, we wanna thank you

78
00:23:21.195 --> 00:23:24.935
for making time to carve out today for him.

79
00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:28.305
Before we get started, let me pray for us.

80
00:23:31.455 --> 00:23:33.355
Father God, thank you.

81
00:23:34.425 --> 00:23:38.975
Thank you for being a loving, merciful, and forgiving God.

82
00:23:40.935 --> 00:23:42.365
Thank you for being mighty

83
00:23:42.705 --> 00:23:45.195
and sovereign in both

84
00:23:45.195 --> 00:23:48.905
of which we can find refuge and peace.

85
00:23:50.685 --> 00:23:55.145
Father, thank you for today this gathering of people coming

86
00:23:55.165 --> 00:23:57.385
to celebrate our beloved Gary.

87
00:23:58.805 --> 00:24:01.955
Thank you for the outpouring of love to Peggy

88
00:24:03.145 --> 00:24:04.405
and our entire family.

89
00:24:04.705 --> 00:24:07.125
For those not only gathered here,

90
00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:08.485
but from across the country.

91
00:24:10.285 --> 00:24:13.795
And Father, today, we will honor Gary

92
00:24:14.535 --> 00:24:17.915
and we'll celebrate his life in this holy place.

93
00:24:19.775 --> 00:24:22.415
And we will be comforted by the fact

94
00:24:22.415 --> 00:24:24.335
that you hold him in heaven.

95
00:24:25.665 --> 00:24:26.665
Amen.

96
00:24:59.985 --> 00:25:03.775
43 years ago at the ripe age of 18,

97
00:25:05.495 --> 00:25:09.945
I was hired by Gary on my first full-time job.

98
00:25:11.115 --> 00:25:12.935
Little did I know what I was getting into

99
00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:17.495
because later he introduced me to a feisty redhead.

100
00:25:19.345 --> 00:25:23.085
And from that very moment, we have been inseparable.

101
00:25:24.195 --> 00:25:26.495
So today I'd like to share just a few things

102
00:25:26.565 --> 00:25:27.615
that are on her heart.

103
00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:31.915
ALSA love story.

104
00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:36.155
I loved hearing the phrase that ALS is a love story.

105
00:25:36.695 --> 00:25:39.115
It certainly was for Gary and I,

106
00:25:40.585 --> 00:25:41.975
after his diagnosis,

107
00:25:42.035 --> 00:25:45.535
the first thing Gary said was, it is what it is.

108
00:25:46.755 --> 00:25:50.215
He faced this disease just like everything else in his life

109
00:25:51.015 --> 00:25:55.105
with a positive attitude and an enormous amount of grace.

110
00:25:57.125 --> 00:25:59.585
He was a humble, generous, loving person.

111
00:26:00.355 --> 00:26:01.385
Never a bragger,

112
00:26:02.045 --> 00:26:03.065
but always a person

113
00:26:03.725 --> 00:26:06.025
who loved others in an unconditional way.

114
00:26:07.645 --> 00:26:10.265
He was showered with FaceTime calls, cards,

115
00:26:10.445 --> 00:26:14.465
and visits by many of you, which he truly treasured.

116
00:26:15.295 --> 00:26:18.675
He was never angry. He said he was just sad.

117
00:26:20.115 --> 00:26:21.895
He taught me what true grace was

118
00:26:21.915 --> 00:26:24.175
and the people that knew him best were

119
00:26:24.175 --> 00:26:25.255
better for knowing him.

120
00:26:25.995 --> 00:26:27.215
And I'm a better person

121
00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:29.455
for having walked this journey with him.

122
00:26:30.815 --> 00:26:33.835
We truly brought out the best in each other.

123
00:26:35.825 --> 00:26:38.985
I had many times throughout our life together that I said,

124
00:26:39.485 --> 00:26:43.485
if it all ended tomorrow, how great is our life?

125
00:26:44.995 --> 00:26:49.055
Our love story gave us time to reflect on our 35 plus years.

126
00:26:49.415 --> 00:26:52.975
Together, we had the opportunity to embrace the beautiful,

127
00:26:53.085 --> 00:26:57.845
blessed life We have lived the amazing places we were able

128
00:26:57.845 --> 00:26:59.205
to travel to, and

129
00:26:59.345 --> 00:27:02.205
so many wonderful friends we met along the way.

130
00:27:03.985 --> 00:27:05.765
We talked about those treasured friends

131
00:27:05.785 --> 00:27:09.205
and how much he's meant to them in friendship and career.

132
00:27:10.515 --> 00:27:13.055
He found comfort in knowing how many friends

133
00:27:13.075 --> 00:27:17.095
and family would be there to support me Through all of this.

134
00:27:18.935 --> 00:27:21.215
Memories of us will always bring a smile to my face,

135
00:27:21.425 --> 00:27:23.935
especially when I look out over t.

136
00:27:25.245 --> 00:27:27.135
That was our happy place.

137
00:27:28.475 --> 00:27:31.055
Our last Christmas was spent there with our family.

138
00:27:31.605 --> 00:27:36.255
Gary and I sat back watching our kids adults together,

139
00:27:36.635 --> 00:27:38.855
and I said, is this what we dreamed of

140
00:27:39.315 --> 00:27:40.775
for the next generation?

141
00:27:41.605 --> 00:27:44.695
When we sat in the wrought iron chairs on the porch

142
00:27:45.955 --> 00:27:48.055
and looked out over Alberta Creek

143
00:27:48.675 --> 00:27:52.655
and made the decision to buy that place for our family

144
00:27:53.435 --> 00:27:56.055
and future families, family,

145
00:27:56.195 --> 00:27:58.855
and many friends have shared that special place

146
00:27:59.755 --> 00:28:01.855
and created some of the best memories.

147
00:28:02.875 --> 00:28:05.495
My hope is to make Gary proud of me

148
00:28:05.715 --> 00:28:08.175
and keep fulfilling our dreams.

149
00:28:09.645 --> 00:28:12.375
I've asked that the poem, the dash be shared with you.

150
00:28:13.115 --> 00:28:16.815
The dash is what Your life is birth to.

151
00:28:16.845 --> 00:28:21.245
Passing The dash

152
00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:22.765
by Linda Ellis.

153
00:28:23.945 --> 00:28:26.945
I read of a man who stood to speak at a funeral of a friend.

154
00:28:27.685 --> 00:28:30.705
He referred to the dates on the tombstone from the

155
00:28:30.705 --> 00:28:31.905
beginning to the end.

156
00:28:32.985 --> 00:28:35.125
He noticed that first came the date of birth

157
00:28:35.665 --> 00:28:38.205
and spoke of the following date with tears.

158
00:28:39.295 --> 00:28:42.555
But he said what mattered most of all was the dash

159
00:28:43.025 --> 00:28:46.315
between those years for that dash

160
00:28:46.875 --> 00:28:49.275
represents all the time they spent alive on earth.

161
00:28:49.855 --> 00:28:51.595
And now only those who love them.

162
00:28:52.585 --> 00:28:57.015
Know what that little line is worth for.

163
00:28:57.015 --> 00:29:00.455
It matters not how much we own the cars,

164
00:29:00.915 --> 00:29:02.175
the house, the cash.

165
00:29:03.165 --> 00:29:05.215
What matters is how we live and love

166
00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:07.535
and how we spend our dash.

167
00:29:09.035 --> 00:29:10.895
So think about this long and hard.

168
00:29:11.395 --> 00:29:14.775
Are there things you'd like to change for you never know

169
00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:18.255
how much time is left that can still be rearranged

170
00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:23.985
to be less quick to anger and show appreciation more.

171
00:29:24.845 --> 00:29:27.145
And love the people in our lives like

172
00:29:27.145 --> 00:29:28.425
we've never loved before.

173
00:29:29.905 --> 00:29:31.765
If we treat each other with respect

174
00:29:32.185 --> 00:29:35.575
and more often, wear a smile remembering

175
00:29:35.575 --> 00:29:39.375
that this special dash might only last a little while.

176
00:29:39.835 --> 00:29:43.555
So, so when your eulogy is being read

177
00:29:43.945 --> 00:29:48.265
with your life's actions to rehash, would you be proud

178
00:29:48.265 --> 00:29:50.065
of the things they say about you

179
00:29:51.235 --> 00:29:52.655
and how you lived your dash?

180
00:29:54.415 --> 00:29:57.035
You're about to hear from some of Gary's colleagues

181
00:29:57.035 --> 00:30:01.705
and best friends, and they will certainly share what

182
00:30:02.335 --> 00:30:04.105
made up Gary's dash.

183
00:30:48.625 --> 00:30:52.905
I can it be

184
00:30:53.335 --> 00:30:55.625
like when I,

185
00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:05.305
I can only imagine what my eyes would see

186
00:31:06.655 --> 00:31:06.945
when

187
00:31:12.625 --> 00:31:14.105
I can only imagine

188
00:31:27.155 --> 00:31:27.505
glory.

189
00:31:28.415 --> 00:31:30.465
What will my heart feel?

190
00:31:30.935 --> 00:31:34.945
Will I dance for your Jesus over and all?

191
00:31:34.975 --> 00:31:36.265
Will you be still?

192
00:31:36.855 --> 00:31:40.825
Will I stand in your presence to my knees?

193
00:31:41.015 --> 00:31:43.585
Will I fall, will sing?

194
00:31:45.815 --> 00:31:50.185
Will I be able to speak it home? I can only imagine?

195
00:31:54.265 --> 00:31:55.505
I can only imagine.

196
00:32:00.305 --> 00:32:03.825
I can only imagine when

197
00:32:03.825 --> 00:32:05.345
that day comes

198
00:32:06.845 --> 00:32:11.425
and I find my sin standing in the sun.

199
00:32:12.465 --> 00:32:17.225
I can only imagine when all I would do

200
00:32:18.725 --> 00:32:23.385
is forever, forever worship you.

201
00:32:24.465 --> 00:32:25.825
I can only imagine.

202
00:32:30.345 --> 00:32:31.785
I can only imagine

203
00:32:37.295 --> 00:32:38.855
surrounded by your glory.

204
00:32:40.145 --> 00:32:44.725
One, will my heart feel will I dance for you?

205
00:32:44.725 --> 00:32:48.045
Jesus, over all of you, be still.

206
00:32:48.595 --> 00:32:52.525
Will I stand in your presence to my knees?

207
00:32:52.675 --> 00:32:57.005
Will I fall? Will I sing? Hallelujah?

208
00:32:57.595 --> 00:33:01.885
Will I be able to speak at all? I can only imagine?

209
00:33:03.785 --> 00:33:07.525
Yes, I can only imagine

210
00:33:13.115 --> 00:33:14.875
surrounded by glory.

211
00:33:15.785 --> 00:33:17.915
What will my heart be?

212
00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:22.595
You will I dance for you, Jesus and all.

213
00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:27.155
Will you be still? Will I stand in your presence?

214
00:33:28.095 --> 00:33:29.875
My knees? Will I fall?

215
00:33:30.265 --> 00:33:34.355
Will I, will I be able

216
00:33:34.455 --> 00:33:36.515
to speak it home? I can

217
00:33:36.515 --> 00:33:37.595
Only imagine?

218
00:33:42.115 --> 00:33:43.395
I can only imagine.

219
00:33:48.105 --> 00:33:49.265
I can only imagine.

220
00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:54.985
I can only imagine

221
00:34:00.185 --> 00:34:00.465
I can

222
00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:18.995
when all I would

223
00:34:19.175 --> 00:34:21.675
Do Is

224
00:34:21.865 --> 00:34:26.045
Forever, forever worship

225
00:34:26.785 --> 00:34:27.785
You.

226
00:34:32.045 --> 00:34:34.925
I can imagine.

227
00:35:17.455 --> 00:35:18.715
My name is Cliff Dowdy.

228
00:35:19.055 --> 00:35:23.315
Um, I had a privilege to share 50 years of Gary's dash

229
00:35:25.355 --> 00:35:30.005
and, uh, made life a true adventure.

230
00:35:30.985 --> 00:35:32.195
Made life challenging.

231
00:35:33.185 --> 00:35:36.835
It was about a year ago when Gary called,

232
00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:40.595
and I could tell by the message he left on my phone

233
00:35:40.865 --> 00:35:42.035
that something was wrong.

234
00:35:42.655 --> 00:35:46.915
And we found out the, the battle that he was up against

235
00:35:48.675 --> 00:35:50.645
Gary and I had many, uh, conversations

236
00:35:50.645 --> 00:35:53.515
where he could still talk about the battle

237
00:35:54.815 --> 00:35:57.385
that he was facing and that he would be up to it.

238
00:36:00.755 --> 00:36:05.135
I'm thankful, very thankful that in

239
00:36:05.135 --> 00:36:08.455
that roughly year time, we had an opportunity to meet,

240
00:36:08.715 --> 00:36:10.215
be together a number of times.

241
00:36:11.955 --> 00:36:13.015
We had a lot to share.

242
00:36:13.555 --> 00:36:17.465
Uh, there's not enough time today to cover

243
00:36:17.465 --> 00:36:22.155
what happens in 50 years with somebody, but he

244
00:36:22.155 --> 00:36:23.875
and I discussed a lot of that.

245
00:36:24.955 --> 00:36:26.255
We discussed the, uh,

246
00:36:29.175 --> 00:36:31.955
we talked about life, we talked about death,

247
00:36:33.065 --> 00:36:34.805
and we talked about life after death.

248
00:36:38.925 --> 00:36:40.905
You know, those are conversations when you're younger,

249
00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:43.585
you go, you know, at some point we're gonna deal with this.

250
00:36:44.245 --> 00:36:47.445
But it's always tomorrow. You tomorrow got here.

251
00:36:51.355 --> 00:36:54.475
I met Gary in 1973.

252
00:36:54.995 --> 00:36:56.595
I was still going to school at ou.

253
00:36:59.575 --> 00:37:03.755
We ended up working at an electronics company together.

254
00:37:05.675 --> 00:37:06.845
Gary was doing sales.

255
00:37:07.365 --> 00:37:09.445
I was doing engineering and technical work there.

256
00:37:12.655 --> 00:37:15.415
I had become interested in video technology at the time.

257
00:37:15.925 --> 00:37:17.735
Very few people even knew what video was.

258
00:37:18.155 --> 00:37:20.815
Uh, it wasn't a well understood term or technology.

259
00:37:22.695 --> 00:37:24.435
And, uh, I had made a proposal.

260
00:37:24.575 --> 00:37:27.275
We were working for a kind of a medical company.

261
00:37:28.095 --> 00:37:31.395
Anyway, I'd made a proposal to add cameras

262
00:37:31.735 --> 00:37:34.635
to a local hospital intensive care unit

263
00:37:35.175 --> 00:37:36.315
for patient monitoring.

264
00:37:37.635 --> 00:37:41.455
And it was immediately turned down that it was a crazy idea.

265
00:37:42.955 --> 00:37:44.535
Not long after that, Gary were, Gary

266
00:37:44.535 --> 00:37:46.655
and I were out on a service call,

267
00:37:48.395 --> 00:37:51.055
and I expressed to Gary my total disappointment of

268
00:37:52.045 --> 00:37:53.495
what a ridiculous response.

269
00:37:54.365 --> 00:37:55.895
Gary picks right up on it

270
00:37:56.075 --> 00:37:58.295
and soon starts discussing, gee,

271
00:37:58.295 --> 00:38:00.055
there's business opportunities there.

272
00:38:01.195 --> 00:38:05.665
And we're off and running. Shortly afterwards,

273
00:38:06.955 --> 00:38:09.045
Gary, uh, at the time I was going to school,

274
00:38:09.045 --> 00:38:10.125
living in a mobile home.

275
00:38:10.395 --> 00:38:12.885
Shortly afterwards, we met at my mobile home.

276
00:38:13.965 --> 00:38:16.645
I had a little lab, electronics lab

277
00:38:18.115 --> 00:38:19.565
with only a handshake.

278
00:38:19.785 --> 00:38:21.605
We began what was called at that time,

279
00:38:21.605 --> 00:38:23.285
electronic Systems Unlimited.

280
00:38:23.945 --> 00:38:26.285
And I want to emphasize only a handshake.

281
00:38:28.015 --> 00:38:30.035
Uh, that's how we got started.

282
00:38:30.175 --> 00:38:31.875
It wasn't like a big business deal.

283
00:38:33.955 --> 00:38:36.965
We quickly moved my equipment to Gary's garage.

284
00:38:37.185 --> 00:38:40.245
He was living in a small three bedroom home

285
00:38:40.245 --> 00:38:41.485
with a single car garage.

286
00:38:44.275 --> 00:38:47.965
And, uh, I'll never forget, we worked outta the garage.

287
00:38:48.785 --> 00:38:50.605
Gary's kitchen table was where a sales

288
00:38:50.625 --> 00:38:51.645
and business took place.

289
00:38:54.625 --> 00:38:56.405
So about that time, Eric came along.

290
00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:59.485
More often than not, he was confined to the backyard.

291
00:39:05.065 --> 00:39:07.925
We worked hard. We took on anything we could find.

292
00:39:08.545 --> 00:39:13.145
We were poor boys. But

293
00:39:13.495 --> 00:39:15.385
soon Gary figured it was time.

294
00:39:15.485 --> 00:39:18.025
We really step into the video business.

295
00:39:20.335 --> 00:39:22.465
Gary, being the consummate sell salesman

296
00:39:22.565 --> 00:39:24.465
and businessman, it wasn't long.

297
00:39:24.525 --> 00:39:27.545
He contacted a large Japanese video company.

298
00:39:31.415 --> 00:39:34.695
A few days later, a Mercedes-Benz pulls up in front

299
00:39:34.695 --> 00:39:38.695
of Gary's house, happens to be sales manager

300
00:39:39.395 --> 00:39:41.615
for half the United States for this company.

301
00:39:42.475 --> 00:39:45.975
Uh, and we commits to sit down at the table

302
00:39:46.005 --> 00:39:49.275
with his gentleman, talk about the opportunities,

303
00:39:51.475 --> 00:39:55.565
and with no office, no money,

304
00:39:57.425 --> 00:40:00.325
no sales force other than Gary sitting at a kitchen table,

305
00:40:01.385 --> 00:40:05.725
we convinced this salesman that we could sell,

306
00:40:06.585 --> 00:40:09.805
design and install anything they had.

307
00:40:11.945 --> 00:40:15.765
So shortly a thereafter, we changed the name of the company

308
00:40:15.865 --> 00:40:17.725
to Electronic Systems Incorporated.

309
00:40:20.315 --> 00:40:22.885
Gary, I, I used to say Gary could make sales

310
00:40:23.545 --> 00:40:27.105
and come up with things to do so fast

311
00:40:27.105 --> 00:40:28.265
that it would take at least five

312
00:40:28.585 --> 00:40:29.705
engineers to stay up with him.

313
00:40:31.285 --> 00:40:35.385
So for my survival, we put on some more help.

314
00:40:38.365 --> 00:40:40.665
As time passed, we moved from the garage

315
00:40:40.765 --> 00:40:42.225
to a small office building,

316
00:40:44.745 --> 00:40:47.625
was not a high class office.

317
00:40:49.145 --> 00:40:52.165
We shared a building with a bar and a liquor store.

318
00:40:53.835 --> 00:40:56.405
True adventure. But we grew

319
00:40:56.545 --> 00:40:59.085
and we expanded in about three years.

320
00:40:59.185 --> 00:41:00.325
We outgrew that office.

321
00:41:02.495 --> 00:41:04.475
We launched a plan to have our own building.

322
00:41:06.235 --> 00:41:09.815
And of course, Gary knew somebody that was a builder

323
00:41:09.995 --> 00:41:11.295
and could find us land.

324
00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:15.255
And shortly thereafter, we had a building program underway.

325
00:41:17.125 --> 00:41:19.345
At that time, Gary and I did a lot of hunting together

326
00:41:20.755 --> 00:41:22.815
and, uh, duck hunting was a big deal.

327
00:41:22.815 --> 00:41:24.255
It was like a religion for us.

328
00:41:25.995 --> 00:41:29.015
And, uh, it, I think it was where we, uh, the stresses

329
00:41:29.075 --> 00:41:30.815
of work kind of went

330
00:41:30.815 --> 00:41:32.695
to the side when we actually went and had fun.

331
00:41:34.635 --> 00:41:38.855
So of course, in this new office, it had to have

332
00:41:39.535 --> 00:41:41.215
a facility, a shower,

333
00:41:41.275 --> 00:41:43.615
and a place that we could go duck hunting early in the

334
00:41:43.615 --> 00:41:45.855
morning, come back to the office

335
00:41:45.955 --> 00:41:46.975
and clean up and go to work.

336
00:41:46.975 --> 00:41:48.575
It looked like we were, you know,

337
00:41:49.205 --> 00:41:51.335
real hardworking people, which we were.

338
00:41:54.595 --> 00:41:56.935
The story quickly grew from there.

339
00:41:57.155 --> 00:41:58.935
We ended up, as I remember,

340
00:41:58.935 --> 00:42:00.775
about a 200 page product catalog.

341
00:42:03.075 --> 00:42:06.055
Gary's out pounding to pave it. Gary's always making a deal.

342
00:42:06.075 --> 00:42:10.575
Gary's always making a sale, but that wasn't enough.

343
00:42:11.025 --> 00:42:12.935
Eventually, underneath the ESI,

344
00:42:13.555 --> 00:42:16.735
we developed four more sub corporations

345
00:42:16.735 --> 00:42:17.975
underneath that business.

346
00:42:19.505 --> 00:42:21.095
Those were very busy days.

347
00:42:22.775 --> 00:42:27.175
Anything from video broadcast to security, to systems

348
00:42:27.175 --> 00:42:29.375
that went on offshore drilling platforms.

349
00:42:29.405 --> 00:42:30.535
Gary had us hooked up.

350
00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:35.815
We were busy somewhere in all that,

351
00:42:35.975 --> 00:42:38.455
I did find time to meet the love of my wife

352
00:42:39.005 --> 00:42:40.375
life and get married.

353
00:42:43.085 --> 00:42:44.615
However, Gary

354
00:42:44.615 --> 00:42:46.495
and I did spend a lot of hours at the office.

355
00:42:46.915 --> 00:42:48.575
We had catches in our office

356
00:42:49.595 --> 00:42:51.895
and they, that's where guests would sit by the day

357
00:42:52.115 --> 00:42:53.855
during the day when they would come in.

358
00:42:53.925 --> 00:42:56.255
It's also where we'd sleep at night when we were working

359
00:42:56.255 --> 00:43:00.895
sometimes, however, I did find time to go home.

360
00:43:01.495 --> 00:43:06.375
I now have two sons. I, Gary

361
00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:10.655
and I made out for starting with nothing with hard work.

362
00:43:11.375 --> 00:43:12.575
A hundred percent faith,

363
00:43:13.255 --> 00:43:15.255
a hundred percent confidence in each other.

364
00:43:16.155 --> 00:43:19.295
No binding contract, just a common goal.

365
00:43:21.235 --> 00:43:25.455
Um, I used to always say, we would show up at the office,

366
00:43:25.675 --> 00:43:27.655
put our keys in the door, open that door up,

367
00:43:27.795 --> 00:43:31.055
and we both went to our, each our, each area of work.

368
00:43:32.915 --> 00:43:35.215
But we weren't ever guessing what the other one was doing.

369
00:43:35.715 --> 00:43:40.095
It was all based on faith and confidence and a common goal.

370
00:43:44.595 --> 00:43:47.895
We survived a lot of hard times, a lot of good times.

371
00:43:48.145 --> 00:43:50.815
Lemme tell you what, the hard times made those good times,

372
00:43:50.945 --> 00:43:54.295
those mountaintop experiences, absolutely grand.

373
00:43:55.195 --> 00:43:56.375
And we would celebrate.

374
00:43:59.385 --> 00:44:01.375
Often we would go pheasant hungry.

375
00:44:01.595 --> 00:44:03.335
I'm wearing a pheasant tie today.

376
00:44:03.445 --> 00:44:05.335
It's a little tattered, been around a while,

377
00:44:05.715 --> 00:44:08.375
but it's in remembrance of so many times that I spent

378
00:44:08.375 --> 00:44:13.255
with Gary and Yik Remember taking him hunting

379
00:44:13.285 --> 00:44:16.495
with us when he was big enough to carry a gun.

380
00:44:19.435 --> 00:44:22.375
And often, you know, you spend all day hunting.

381
00:44:22.485 --> 00:44:24.655
Some days you got good luck, sometimes you don't.

382
00:44:25.275 --> 00:44:26.775
But I remember towards the end of the day,

383
00:44:26.775 --> 00:44:29.015
after a long day of walking, we'd look at each other

384
00:44:29.075 --> 00:44:30.775
and go, Hey, you got another mile in you.

385
00:44:30.775 --> 00:44:32.130
Maybe, maybe we'll have better luck.

386
00:44:34.885 --> 00:44:36.455
Same thing would happen at the office.

387
00:44:37.845 --> 00:44:39.575
What we did when we weren't in the office

388
00:44:41.595 --> 00:44:42.975
was often a reflection of

389
00:44:42.975 --> 00:44:44.815
what happened at the office when we were working

390
00:44:45.755 --> 00:44:48.855
so many times, particularly there was, uh,

391
00:44:48.855 --> 00:44:51.015
some difficult times during the eighties.

392
00:44:53.025 --> 00:44:54.045
We would look at each other

393
00:44:54.145 --> 00:44:56.045
and go, you got another mile in you,

394
00:44:57.265 --> 00:44:58.605
and we'd go after it again.

395
00:44:58.955 --> 00:45:01.885
Even though for a normal sane person,

396
00:45:02.025 --> 00:45:03.485
it seemed totally unreasonable.

397
00:45:11.645 --> 00:45:15.505
Excuse me. In the Bible,

398
00:45:16.135 --> 00:45:20.545
there's a verse, Ecclesiastes four, nine to 10.

399
00:45:21.605 --> 00:45:22.905
You may be familiar with it,

400
00:45:23.205 --> 00:45:27.025
but it goes, here's the verse two or better than one,

401
00:45:27.695 --> 00:45:29.945
because they have a good return for their labor.

402
00:45:31.325 --> 00:45:36.315
If either of them falls down, one can help the other up

403
00:45:38.305 --> 00:45:39.715
pity on the one who falls down

404
00:45:39.775 --> 00:45:41.275
and has no one to help them up.

405
00:45:44.385 --> 00:45:46.245
That's how it was with Gary as a partner.

406
00:45:47.835 --> 00:45:50.005
Whether it was the times he took me to the hospital,

407
00:45:50.175 --> 00:45:51.685
which did happen a couple of times,

408
00:45:53.025 --> 00:45:54.405
or the times I'd go by his house.

409
00:45:54.405 --> 00:45:57.325
At one time, Gary had a very severe lower back issue,

410
00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:00.725
and I would go by his home

411
00:46:00.985 --> 00:46:02.365
and I'd help him get ready to come to work.

412
00:46:04.945 --> 00:46:08.945
And so we carried each other,

413
00:46:09.895 --> 00:46:12.465
whether it was at work or whether it was in personal life.

414
00:46:12.535 --> 00:46:17.505
It's like, what are we gotta do? That's what we did. Okay.

415
00:46:18.095 --> 00:46:19.305
There's a lot of stories.

416
00:46:19.305 --> 00:46:21.225
There's no way I can put 50 years

417
00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:25.345
of stories into short comments up here today.

418
00:46:26.965 --> 00:46:30.505
Um, but there's some funny ones.

419
00:46:31.405 --> 00:46:33.665
We were pheasant hunting in one time, in a

420
00:46:34.215 --> 00:46:35.345
fold out tent trailer.

421
00:46:36.795 --> 00:46:38.905
Those of you from Oklahoma knows how the know

422
00:46:38.965 --> 00:46:41.145
how the wind can blow at times.

423
00:46:42.565 --> 00:46:45.105
So we got caught in a pretty significant

424
00:46:45.105 --> 00:46:46.425
windstorm while we're hunting.

425
00:46:48.135 --> 00:46:52.025
Gary loved to cook. He's at the stove cooking.

426
00:46:53.725 --> 00:46:54.945
I'm doing everything, trying

427
00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:56.305
to hold this tent trailer together

428
00:46:56.305 --> 00:46:58.585
to keep it from blowing over or blowing apart.

429
00:47:01.175 --> 00:47:03.385
Another time we're out duck hunting one morning.

430
00:47:05.565 --> 00:47:09.945
And, uh, it was a pretty dense wooded swamp fog sets in.

431
00:47:11.365 --> 00:47:13.425
We begin to wonder if we'd ever find our way out.

432
00:47:13.445 --> 00:47:17.425
But we did. And it was another time.

433
00:47:17.705 --> 00:47:20.425
I, I was kind of a Corvette fanatic at one time.

434
00:47:21.045 --> 00:47:22.145
So I just finished putting

435
00:47:22.165 --> 00:47:23.505
one together, took it to the office.

436
00:47:24.695 --> 00:47:27.705
Gary gets in it, we pull out on MacArthur and he nails it.

437
00:47:30.865 --> 00:47:33.085
Uh, we're accelerating towards a red light.

438
00:47:33.085 --> 00:47:36.005
He lets up on the gas. And lo and behold, gas pedals stuck.

439
00:47:38.705 --> 00:47:41.125
But we managed to get it shut down just in time.

440
00:47:44.475 --> 00:47:47.045
Most of those experiences like that outside

441
00:47:47.045 --> 00:47:51.315
of work was a reflection of how we made it at work.

442
00:47:52.495 --> 00:47:55.515
It was always so many times just in time, but it was

443
00:47:55.515 --> 00:47:56.875
because we were together

444
00:47:57.175 --> 00:48:01.595
and we were in sync in business.

445
00:48:01.625 --> 00:48:04.075
Gary always brought so many cal challenges.

446
00:48:04.295 --> 00:48:07.275
It required a lot of commitment, required a lot of growth.

447
00:48:08.785 --> 00:48:10.515
Life was never boring with Gary

448
00:48:12.535 --> 00:48:14.635
during those days and months and years.

449
00:48:16.385 --> 00:48:20.035
Long, hard hours. We became more more than partners.

450
00:48:20.935 --> 00:48:25.525
We were like brothers. We could communicate

451
00:48:25.525 --> 00:48:26.645
even without talking.

452
00:48:30.615 --> 00:48:34.245
Quote came to mind as I was thinking about this, that

453
00:48:35.235 --> 00:48:38.045
somehow summarizes what the partnership was

454
00:48:38.045 --> 00:48:39.125
between Gary and I.

455
00:48:40.595 --> 00:48:42.525
This is a quote from Warren Buffett.

456
00:48:44.365 --> 00:48:46.415
Partnership is not a legal contract

457
00:48:46.685 --> 00:48:48.655
between two equal individuals.

458
00:48:49.445 --> 00:48:52.695
There's an emotional alliance between two people

459
00:48:53.195 --> 00:48:55.575
who are committed to each other's success.

460
00:48:59.255 --> 00:49:01.775
I give thanks to Gary in those early years

461
00:49:02.405 --> 00:49:05.015
that ended up charting his life course

462
00:49:05.755 --> 00:49:06.975
in my own life course.

463
00:49:08.475 --> 00:49:10.495
We were blessed with people who believed in us.

464
00:49:13.215 --> 00:49:16.195
We had so many employees that stuck it out

465
00:49:16.195 --> 00:49:17.635
to the good times and the bad times.

466
00:49:17.735 --> 00:49:22.715
We were a family. Eventually, Gary

467
00:49:22.715 --> 00:49:26.355
and I did take different paths, which allowed each one of us

468
00:49:26.415 --> 00:49:30.715
to pursue our own dreams.

469
00:49:34.025 --> 00:49:35.755
That was okay. We were still partners.

470
00:49:38.635 --> 00:49:40.195
A few days before Gary passed,

471
00:49:44.315 --> 00:49:49.195
I sent him a text and we were talking about this

472
00:49:49.305 --> 00:49:52.875
long life, this dash of life that we had spent together

473
00:49:56.045 --> 00:49:58.435
about all the things that happened, the ups and downs.

474
00:50:02.095 --> 00:50:04.515
And his last response to me was,

475
00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.395
and yes, we're still partners.

476
00:50:07.975 --> 00:50:09.755
That's a pretty special statement to me.

477
00:50:12.775 --> 00:50:15.475
Uh, it's not often you go through life

478
00:50:15.495 --> 00:50:18.035
and spend that much time with somebody who's maybe not your

479
00:50:18.035 --> 00:50:22.115
spouse, and you still have that type of a

480
00:50:23.205 --> 00:50:27.285
close bond, a bond that even whether you're part

481
00:50:27.305 --> 00:50:30.205
or together, there's still a bond that doesn't go away.

482
00:50:33.025 --> 00:50:36.405
So Gary and I talked about as we led up to this,

483
00:50:36.425 --> 00:50:40.565
we had talked about what were, that he knew he was facing

484
00:50:41.555 --> 00:50:45.985
death and we agreed based on the common faith

485
00:50:47.735 --> 00:50:50.065
That we would see each other again.

486
00:50:51.435 --> 00:50:52.435
Thank you.

487
00:51:39.575 --> 00:51:42.665
Good morning. My name is Charlie Federico.

488
00:51:42.885 --> 00:51:44.585
I'm from Charlotte, North Carolina.

489
00:51:45.925 --> 00:51:47.105
An interesting part

490
00:51:47.105 --> 00:51:49.865
of starting this is thinking back on the relationship

491
00:51:49.895 --> 00:51:53.785
that Guyer and I formed, which is now has been 40 years.

492
00:51:55.085 --> 00:51:57.345
And what you've got is a kid who grew up in the streets

493
00:51:57.365 --> 00:52:01.905
of the Bronx in New York City, somehow

494
00:52:02.445 --> 00:52:04.185
became best friends with a kid

495
00:52:04.185 --> 00:52:05.745
who grew up in the backwoods of Missouri.

496
00:52:07.285 --> 00:52:09.305
And, uh, I discovered,

497
00:52:09.365 --> 00:52:12.065
and I've said it to Gary many times, that God,

498
00:52:12.135 --> 00:52:13.585
I've been a country boy my whole life.

499
00:52:13.745 --> 00:52:15.065
I just was trapped in the north.

500
00:52:15.385 --> 00:52:17.785
I didn't realize how much fun we could have, you know?

501
00:52:19.045 --> 00:52:20.785
And we were partners not only in business,

502
00:52:20.805 --> 00:52:22.585
but part what I call it partners in fun.

503
00:52:24.005 --> 00:52:25.665
And I wanna share a couple of stories with you

504
00:52:25.665 --> 00:52:27.705
and please feel free to laugh if they're funny,

505
00:52:27.765 --> 00:52:32.745
but laugh anyway, if they're not, you know, In 1980,

506
00:52:32.925 --> 00:52:35.145
I'm gonna overlap some of the things Cliff told you when

507
00:52:35.145 --> 00:52:37.945
they were struggling back in the early eighties.

508
00:52:37.985 --> 00:52:39.465
I met Gary in 1983

509
00:52:40.885 --> 00:52:44.065
and at that point I was in the arthroscopy business.

510
00:52:44.245 --> 00:52:45.705
One of the bigger players in that.

511
00:52:46.405 --> 00:52:49.665
And Arthroscopes were a thing of the past.

512
00:52:50.245 --> 00:52:54.305
It was video cameras attached to Arthroscopes.

513
00:52:54.305 --> 00:52:56.745
That was the trend. And this is

514
00:52:56.885 --> 00:52:59.665
so the people in the operating room could see what's going

515
00:52:59.685 --> 00:53:02.305
on and the doctor could do comment and all that.

516
00:53:02.365 --> 00:53:04.145
It lightened up the whole surgery instead

517
00:53:04.145 --> 00:53:07.545
of watching somebody for two hours with a round tube looking

518
00:53:07.605 --> 00:53:09.585
inside a knee, trying to figure out what's going on.

519
00:53:10.365 --> 00:53:12.465
So all the major companies scrambled

520
00:53:12.605 --> 00:53:14.225
to find a partner for a video.

521
00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:17.345
And I met Gary, I believe it was an academy meeting,

522
00:53:17.445 --> 00:53:18.545
I'm not sure, I don't remember.

523
00:53:19.445 --> 00:53:21.505
But, uh, he had C Corp

524
00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:24.145
and C Corp was a company

525
00:53:24.145 --> 00:53:26.040
that was producing handheld cameras.

526
00:53:27.065 --> 00:53:29.125
And I was looking for a partner.

527
00:53:30.005 --> 00:53:32.165
I didn't want to be one in one of those situations

528
00:53:32.165 --> 00:53:34.685
where I was at the whims of a vendor of some sort.

529
00:53:34.745 --> 00:53:36.085
So I wanted to buy something.

530
00:53:37.305 --> 00:53:38.565
And I mentioned that to Gary

531
00:53:39.625 --> 00:53:42.365
and we had our first conversation about this guess where

532
00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:46.405
on a golf course, except we weren't playing.

533
00:53:47.105 --> 00:53:50.325
We just walked the golf path Mountain, talking about life,

534
00:53:50.325 --> 00:53:51.725
talking about my vision for

535
00:53:51.725 --> 00:53:53.645
what I think these this company could look like.

536
00:53:54.155 --> 00:53:58.205
Gary was extremely interested in, in how his people would do

537
00:53:58.865 --> 00:54:00.045
in a situation like that.

538
00:54:00.105 --> 00:54:01.485
We spent a lot of time on that,

539
00:54:01.505 --> 00:54:03.885
and I'm happy to say I think I've honored everything I told

540
00:54:03.885 --> 00:54:05.405
him that we would do.

541
00:54:05.505 --> 00:54:07.565
And, uh, his facility continued to grow

542
00:54:07.565 --> 00:54:09.245
and the business moved to Oklahoma City.

543
00:54:10.665 --> 00:54:15.525
And, uh, we started these

544
00:54:15.525 --> 00:54:17.925
negotiations, I'll call 'em negotiations

545
00:54:17.925 --> 00:54:20.445
because they were kind of, you know,

546
00:54:21.105 --> 00:54:23.285
the agendas were a little different, but not really.

547
00:54:23.525 --> 00:54:25.485
I mean, it was just try to make something happen rather

548
00:54:25.485 --> 00:54:26.605
than the word negotiation.

549
00:54:27.625 --> 00:54:29.565
And it got to the point where we

550
00:54:29.565 --> 00:54:30.765
weren't making a lot of progress.

551
00:54:31.985 --> 00:54:34.365
So I invited Gary to fly up to, uh, Boston,

552
00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:38.205
and it was in the fall, and he showed up

553
00:54:38.205 --> 00:54:41.485
and he had a pair of jeans, uh, a golf sha, a shirt

554
00:54:41.485 --> 00:54:42.925
and a windbreaker on.

555
00:54:44.145 --> 00:54:45.205
He gets in the car and,

556
00:54:45.225 --> 00:54:46.805
and he thinks he's going to the office,

557
00:54:46.945 --> 00:54:48.805
but I take him to the Merrimack River

558
00:54:49.975 --> 00:54:53.195
where I had my bass boat and I said, we're going fishing.

559
00:54:54.455 --> 00:54:59.295
He goes, okay, had to be 50 degrees.

560
00:55:00.795 --> 00:55:02.375
The water was pretty cold.

561
00:55:03.595 --> 00:55:07.775
And I drove about 12 miles at 50 miles an hour

562
00:55:08.035 --> 00:55:09.135
up the Merrimack River.

563
00:55:10.995 --> 00:55:12.535
And I get up there and I look at Gary

564
00:55:12.715 --> 00:55:15.735
and he is purple, absolutely purple.

565
00:55:16.035 --> 00:55:17.415
And I just smiled to my side.

566
00:55:17.415 --> 00:55:19.495
I didn't say anything and I,

567
00:55:19.795 --> 00:55:21.135
we started fishing this one little

568
00:55:21.135 --> 00:55:22.215
hole that I liked on the river.

569
00:55:22.315 --> 00:55:25.015
And, you know, it happened many times.

570
00:55:25.295 --> 00:55:27.855
I caught a dozen and Gary caught one, alright?

571
00:55:29.075 --> 00:55:31.095
And I looked at him and I said, you know,

572
00:55:31.095 --> 00:55:33.415
this is all about the art of negotiation.

573
00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:38.335
I said, one of the main principles is you take your opponent

574
00:55:39.475 --> 00:55:43.295
to an unfamiliar place and you make them uncomfortable.

575
00:55:44.205 --> 00:55:48.415
Have I succeeded? He could for this lovely crowd.

576
00:55:48.495 --> 00:55:49.655
I can't tell you what he what I said,

577
00:55:49.655 --> 00:55:53.175
but you can imagine what he said, you know, well soon

578
00:55:53.295 --> 00:55:54.975
after, not necessarily because that,

579
00:55:54.975 --> 00:55:56.655
but maybe he didn't want another fishing trip in

580
00:55:56.655 --> 00:55:57.655
Massachusetts, I don't know.

581
00:55:57.675 --> 00:55:59.455
But we were able to put it together

582
00:56:00.475 --> 00:56:04.575
and uh, uh, we had a big celebration dinner

583
00:56:05.435 --> 00:56:07.775
in Boston after the, the business closed one night.

584
00:56:08.315 --> 00:56:11.975
And, uh, I think Peggy needs to tell you stories about that.

585
00:56:12.175 --> 00:56:13.975
I mean, she fell in love with lobster

586
00:56:14.115 --> 00:56:15.215
and good wine that night

587
00:56:15.835 --> 00:56:18.655
and, uh, was overserved certainly, you know,

588
00:56:19.515 --> 00:56:21.615
and, uh, there's a couple of stories that Peggy can,

589
00:56:21.715 --> 00:56:23.055
can enhance with you.

590
00:56:25.425 --> 00:56:30.125
So from there, in 1997, I was recruited

591
00:56:30.125 --> 00:56:32.725
to a company called Orthofix as the CEO.

592
00:56:33.545 --> 00:56:35.325
And it was a public company at the time,

593
00:56:35.345 --> 00:56:36.845
and it was an experience of a public company.

594
00:56:36.845 --> 00:56:37.845
It was not experienced. I had,

595
00:56:37.885 --> 00:56:40.085
I had been a president since 33 years old,

596
00:56:40.145 --> 00:56:41.885
but never a public company.

597
00:56:42.585 --> 00:56:45.645
So I was intrigued by it and took the position.

598
00:56:46.585 --> 00:56:49.845
And, uh, my wife, Joanne, who can't be with us today,

599
00:56:49.865 --> 00:56:50.925
and dear friends of Gary

600
00:56:50.925 --> 00:56:54.565
and Peggy also, uh, did not wanna move to Texas.

601
00:56:55.725 --> 00:56:58.205
I I certainly can't explain why not.

602
00:56:58.445 --> 00:57:02.725
I mean, but I, I had to go so that we got an apartment,

603
00:57:03.205 --> 00:57:05.565
a two bedroom apartment in Richardson, Texas.

604
00:57:07.105 --> 00:57:10.285
And, uh, I proceeded

605
00:57:11.185 --> 00:57:13.485
to show up in October of 97, and

606
00:57:13.535 --> 00:57:17.565
after three months, the, the alarms went off in my head.

607
00:57:18.365 --> 00:57:20.445
I need Gary. Remember Gary

608
00:57:20.445 --> 00:57:21.725
and I had worked together a long time

609
00:57:21.725 --> 00:57:23.605
and I said, I got some inside problems.

610
00:57:23.725 --> 00:57:26.165
I got some outside problems, I got all kinds of issues.

611
00:57:26.825 --> 00:57:29.245
And Gary had been, how do I describe this?

612
00:57:29.305 --> 00:57:32.005
Had taken adventure into the restaurant

613
00:57:32.285 --> 00:57:33.525
business at this period.

614
00:57:34.825 --> 00:57:38.125
And for some reason he was ready to do something else.

615
00:57:39.485 --> 00:57:42.525
I, you know, those of you closer to it may know,

616
00:57:42.545 --> 00:57:44.525
may know the reason I, it was Billy Belu, right?

617
00:57:44.875 --> 00:57:46.725
Yeah. I thought Billy be blues was a lot of fun.

618
00:57:47.425 --> 00:57:51.725
But, uh, he, uh, he looked favorably on the idea

619
00:57:51.725 --> 00:57:54.045
of coming in to, uh, ortho fix

620
00:57:54.105 --> 00:57:57.205
and being my, you know, being partners in artifacts.

621
00:57:57.205 --> 00:58:01.205
Like we were at s and I told them to come down.

622
00:58:01.685 --> 00:58:03.925
I have this two bedroom apartment, uh,

623
00:58:04.065 --> 00:58:05.445
get used to it and all that stuff.

624
00:58:05.585 --> 00:58:08.965
No, no fast relocation necessary, anything.

625
00:58:08.965 --> 00:58:10.725
We can work this out and you can get comfortable.

626
00:58:10.725 --> 00:58:11.685
And if you're comfortable and

627
00:58:11.685 --> 00:58:12.765
you wanna move down, let's fine.

628
00:58:12.785 --> 00:58:14.245
But I'm not gonna force you

629
00:58:14.245 --> 00:58:15.325
to do anything you don't wanna do.

630
00:58:16.745 --> 00:58:18.125
And that actually worked pretty well.

631
00:58:18.185 --> 00:58:20.245
So here was born the first odd couple,

632
00:58:22.425 --> 00:58:25.245
and whichever one of us got home last would open the door

633
00:58:25.245 --> 00:58:26.645
and say, honey, I'm home.

634
00:58:28.275 --> 00:58:31.485
Gary knew his way around the kitchen. I was a slob.

635
00:58:32.785 --> 00:58:35.245
So the two of us did fine. Yeah.

636
00:58:36.385 --> 00:58:39.525
And it was in the beginning that we went to Kmart

637
00:58:40.425 --> 00:58:43.965
and we bought a one of those round plastic tables about

638
00:58:44.475 --> 00:58:46.645
this big a round and two plastic chairs

639
00:58:47.745 --> 00:58:49.285
for about $25 I remember.

640
00:58:50.025 --> 00:58:52.205
And we bought an $80 bottle of scotch

641
00:58:54.185 --> 00:58:56.525
and had, we had a little patio outside this apartment,

642
00:58:56.585 --> 00:58:58.525
and we put those chairs in that table out there

643
00:58:58.525 --> 00:59:00.605
with the bottle of scotch and we'd get home

644
00:59:00.605 --> 00:59:01.645
at all crazy hours.

645
00:59:02.145 --> 00:59:06.405
And we'd sit out there at night and crack that scotch open.

646
00:59:06.665 --> 00:59:08.605
And I will tell you today,

647
00:59:08.965 --> 00:59:10.725
I wouldn't have told you when I was running a public

648
00:59:10.725 --> 00:59:13.645
company, there wasn't one major decision made about

649
00:59:13.645 --> 00:59:15.845
what we were doing in that company that was not made on

650
00:59:15.845 --> 00:59:17.685
that patio, right?

651
00:59:17.685 --> 00:59:19.205
That was the routine. You

652
00:59:19.205 --> 00:59:20.245
know, what'd you, what was your day like?

653
00:59:20.245 --> 00:59:21.660
What'd you find out? Blah, blah, blah, you know?

654
00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:25.125
And we proceeded to, to work very hard

655
00:59:26.695 --> 00:59:30.115
and, uh, I can only give you the accomplishments

656
00:59:30.115 --> 00:59:31.755
after 10 years

657
00:59:31.815 --> 00:59:34.635
or so, whatever it was that the, we took,

658
00:59:34.665 --> 00:59:35.795
when I took the company over,

659
00:59:35.815 --> 00:59:37.555
the share price was $4 a share.

660
00:59:39.055 --> 00:59:42.875
It had gone public at $10, it traded up to 20,

661
00:59:43.855 --> 00:59:46.995
and they made an acquisition in the us which the integration

662
00:59:47.065 --> 00:59:50.075
fell on its face and hence the $4 share price

663
00:59:51.295 --> 00:59:55.595
and losing money, it took us till June

664
00:59:57.575 --> 01:00:00.155
of 98, which is six months of Gary

665
01:00:00.215 --> 01:00:04.275
and eight months of me to get that company profitable.

666
01:00:04.655 --> 01:00:06.835
It wasn't pleasant, but we got it profitable.

667
01:00:07.655 --> 01:00:10.675
It took us a little while longer to understand the metrics

668
01:00:11.495 --> 01:00:13.915
and the buttons you have to push to make the performance

669
01:00:13.915 --> 01:00:15.435
of the company look right.

670
01:00:16.225 --> 01:00:20.395
Nothing illegal, but just the blending of all the businesses

671
01:00:20.395 --> 01:00:21.515
and how it all comes together.

672
01:00:22.655 --> 01:00:27.035
And once we got that, we started reporting quarterly results

673
01:00:28.735 --> 01:00:30.195
And share price.

674
01:00:30.215 --> 01:00:33.095
At the end of my,

675
01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:35.655
my reign there was about $45.

676
01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:38.255
So it actually worked out well.

677
01:00:38.915 --> 01:00:42.175
But the bottom line on that is that the quarterly results

678
01:00:43.075 --> 01:00:44.535
of sales and earnings,

679
01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:49.095
we hit our targets 37 quarters in a row.

680
01:00:50.565 --> 01:00:54.095
Okay? And I give a lot of that credit for that to Gary

681
01:00:54.605 --> 01:00:56.535
because it was an operations business,

682
01:00:57.075 --> 01:00:58.095
and that's where we were hurt,

683
01:00:58.095 --> 01:00:59.735
and that's where we had to take the money at.

684
01:00:59.735 --> 01:01:00.975
That's where we take the focus.

685
01:01:01.355 --> 01:01:03.575
That's where we had to get our arms around it.

686
01:01:03.575 --> 01:01:05.815
And he did a hell of a job, right?

687
01:01:05.835 --> 01:01:07.335
And we both enjoyed the success.

688
01:01:07.355 --> 01:01:08.495
Now we've had plenty of failures,

689
01:01:09.235 --> 01:01:12.335
but that, you know, was a tough one, but it was a success.

690
01:01:12.365 --> 01:01:16.655
Oops. Successful one. All right.

691
01:01:16.655 --> 01:01:19.335
That's sort of enough of the, the business stories.

692
01:01:19.695 --> 01:01:23.735
I think that, uh, the fun stories,

693
01:01:25.445 --> 01:01:26.975
I'll start out with the meatball story.

694
01:01:27.715 --> 01:01:31.095
All that apartment that we lived in,

695
01:01:33.235 --> 01:01:35.325
Everybody at the company knew we were two

696
01:01:35.605 --> 01:01:36.685
bachelors in that apartment.

697
01:01:37.865 --> 01:01:39.645
We probably weren't eating right, you know,

698
01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.085
which we weren't and so forth.

699
01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:45.205
So all of a sudden, every morning on my desk is a Tupperware

700
01:01:45.715 --> 01:01:48.765
with some sort of dinner item for us

701
01:01:49.515 --> 01:01:52.285
that we could just heat up and, and, and have.

702
01:01:52.305 --> 01:01:54.165
And we, I mean, we survived in that stuff.

703
01:01:54.485 --> 01:01:56.245
I mean, as much as Gary liked to cook,

704
01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:57.565
when you're getting there eight o'clock at night,

705
01:01:57.565 --> 01:01:58.765
you don't want cooking dinner.

706
01:02:00.505 --> 01:02:02.645
So we had our little scotch on the porch

707
01:02:02.745 --> 01:02:04.805
and we went inside, all right, let's see what we got.

708
01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:05.885
And opened this container up

709
01:02:06.345 --> 01:02:08.885
and in it is three big

710
01:02:09.315 --> 01:02:11.765
meatballs, and we're looking at them.

711
01:02:13.385 --> 01:02:16.045
So I said to Gary, I said, well, who gets two?

712
01:02:16.045 --> 01:02:20.285
And who gets one? And he's looking at me.

713
01:02:21.245 --> 01:02:24.645
I said, I have an idea. There's a golf course over here

714
01:02:24.645 --> 01:02:25.645
that's lit at night.

715
01:02:25.645 --> 01:02:26.885
It's nine holes. I said,

716
01:02:26.885 --> 01:02:28.445
let's go play nine holes for a meatball.

717
01:02:31.155 --> 01:02:32.405
He's not here to defend himself.

718
01:02:32.485 --> 01:02:35.725
I won't tell you who won, but, so one of us got two

719
01:02:35.825 --> 01:02:36.885
and one of us had one.

720
01:02:36.885 --> 01:02:39.565
And that was sort of the spirit that,

721
01:02:39.565 --> 01:02:40.765
that we operated under.

722
01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:44.925
I mean, it was just a, you know, you know,

723
01:02:44.925 --> 01:02:45.965
we've been very fortunate.

724
01:02:46.985 --> 01:02:50.925
We, we've been able to play golf, we've been able to fish,

725
01:02:50.935 --> 01:02:52.405
we've been able to chase turkeys in some

726
01:02:52.405 --> 01:02:53.845
of the most beautiful places in the world.

727
01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:58.485
And we coined a phrase, it's not, it's not unique to us,

728
01:02:58.485 --> 01:03:01.445
but we used it a lot, which is having fun is hard work.

729
01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.325
Illustration of that is, one day when we were hunting

730
01:03:05.395 --> 01:03:08.085
with this guy over here out in, in, uh, Kansas,

731
01:03:09.245 --> 01:03:11.045
I looked at my iPhone at the end of the day

732
01:03:12.265 --> 01:03:14.005
and I walked 19 miles

733
01:03:14.985 --> 01:03:19.725
and I climbed 99 stories trying to chase a Turkey down.

734
01:03:21.025 --> 01:03:23.445
And that was not unique. That was not a unique day.

735
01:03:23.445 --> 01:03:25.405
That was a typical day on a, you know,

736
01:03:25.405 --> 01:03:26.685
a hundred thousand acre farm.

737
01:03:27.665 --> 01:03:30.605
And, uh, you know, so

738
01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:32.845
there was a little work.

739
01:03:34.465 --> 01:03:35.845
And the last story would be

740
01:03:39.025 --> 01:03:42.115
at a board meeting at Orthofix.

741
01:03:42.255 --> 01:03:44.955
The chairman lived in the Seychelles,

742
01:03:45.415 --> 01:03:46.995
and we had a plant in the Seychelles.

743
01:03:46.995 --> 01:03:49.875
So he decided we should have a meeting and the,

744
01:03:49.895 --> 01:03:51.955
and we should all fly to the Seychelles

745
01:03:51.975 --> 01:03:55.115
and have a board meeting on a place called Bird Island.

746
01:03:55.855 --> 01:03:57.115
You remember Peggy? Yes.

747
01:03:57.895 --> 01:04:01.315
All of you need to ask Peggy about her experiences on Bird

748
01:04:01.315 --> 01:04:06.195
Island, but it was the kind of place

749
01:04:06.195 --> 01:04:08.675
that was nothing to do except this resort.

750
01:04:09.455 --> 01:04:11.115
And in the evening after the meeting,

751
01:04:11.385 --> 01:04:12.755
everybody would get out

752
01:04:12.895 --> 01:04:15.515
and walk the circumference of the island,

753
01:04:16.005 --> 01:04:18.915
which was about a mile and chitchat and so forth.

754
01:04:18.985 --> 01:04:22.435
Well, I'm not gonna have any of that. I had a fly rod.

755
01:04:24.045 --> 01:04:25.305
So I went down to the beach

756
01:04:26.525 --> 01:04:29.105
and I go out to where the waves are breaking

757
01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:31.345
and I start fishing the fly rod.

758
01:04:31.365 --> 01:04:32.665
And lo and behold,

759
01:04:34.265 --> 01:04:37.665
I hook a massive fish called a Grand Traval.

760
01:04:39.405 --> 01:04:41.985
And for those of you who don't fish, there's, there's

761
01:04:41.985 --> 01:04:43.265
so much line on a flywheel.

762
01:04:43.265 --> 01:04:44.945
And this fish took all the line

763
01:04:45.045 --> 01:04:47.625
and all the backing I got right down to the end,

764
01:04:48.165 --> 01:04:50.945
and I could do nothing but hold the spool and broke him off.

765
01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:53.025
And I said, my God.

766
01:04:53.285 --> 01:04:54.945
So that night I tell Gary this story,

767
01:04:55.385 --> 01:04:56.665
I said, I got found this place.

768
01:04:57.345 --> 01:05:00.105
I said, you know, let's get up before breakfast.

769
01:05:00.235 --> 01:05:02.305
Let's go out there before all the nonsense starts,

770
01:05:02.645 --> 01:05:04.425
and let's see if we can hooks as many

771
01:05:04.425 --> 01:05:05.465
of these things with a fly rod.

772
01:05:05.885 --> 01:05:08.505
He said, okay. So we go out, it's dark

773
01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:12.735
and there's a, what they call a flat about the size

774
01:05:12.735 --> 01:05:14.855
of this auditorium to the, where the breakers are.

775
01:05:14.855 --> 01:05:16.935
And the water's only about two feet deep.

776
01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:20.045
So we proceed to hike through this thing,

777
01:05:21.065 --> 01:05:23.205
and we line up about 20 feet apart,

778
01:05:23.265 --> 01:05:25.965
and we're casting flies out into the surf.

779
01:05:27.265 --> 01:05:30.925
And at the exact same moment, Gary

780
01:05:30.985 --> 01:05:35.725
and I see a tiger shark that had to be the size

781
01:05:35.725 --> 01:05:40.045
of a car in the breakers just cruising in front of us.

782
01:05:40.345 --> 01:05:41.605
And you swore that his eye

783
01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:42.845
was looking right at the two of us.

784
01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:45.445
I mean, and he, I mean he, we were at the end of this.

785
01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:48.565
So it was simultaneously.

786
01:05:55.745 --> 01:05:59.245
And I, I remember turning to Gary

787
01:05:59.305 --> 01:06:02.925
and saying, I don't have to be fast.

788
01:06:03.205 --> 01:06:04.925
I just have to be faster than you.

789
01:06:10.315 --> 01:06:14.085
Well, I mean, like Cliff, of course, 40 years I could,

790
01:06:14.085 --> 01:06:15.365
you know, we could spend the whole day.

791
01:06:15.545 --> 01:06:17.885
And I'm happy to tell stories about Gary if you'd like me

792
01:06:17.885 --> 01:06:20.005
to, but I think in the sense that we have other people

793
01:06:20.005 --> 01:06:22.845
that need to speak on a serious note.

794
01:06:23.005 --> 01:06:27.245
I, the last time I saw Gary, we hugged

795
01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:31.755
as I was leaving, I thanked him

796
01:06:32.815 --> 01:06:35.235
for sharing, well, what's called now the dash.

797
01:06:35.535 --> 01:06:37.595
But I said to him, this period of my life

798
01:06:38.485 --> 01:06:40.675
where our families were intertwined, our business

799
01:06:40.675 --> 01:06:42.195
and our fund was all intertwined.

800
01:06:42.215 --> 01:06:43.715
And I thanked him for that.

801
01:06:44.695 --> 01:06:46.795
And I told him that a day would not go by

802
01:06:47.725 --> 01:06:49.275
where I didn't think about him.

803
01:06:51.255 --> 01:06:54.195
And it's certainly these days it has been.

804
01:06:55.415 --> 01:06:58.515
And Gary, you had that little machine at the end,

805
01:06:58.575 --> 01:07:01.555
you talked about it, cliff, and he wrote me a text

806
01:07:02.135 --> 01:07:03.635
and I've got, I wanna read it to you.

807
01:07:03.985 --> 01:07:08.035
I'll try to read it to you. Thank you for coming.

808
01:07:10.005 --> 01:07:11.035
Great to see you.

809
01:07:13.135 --> 01:07:15.675
You are my brother from another mother.

810
01:07:16.295 --> 01:07:21.105
Yes. Rest in peace, my brother.

811
01:07:21.715 --> 01:07:22.145
Thank you.

812
01:08:09.295 --> 01:08:14.145
Good afternoon. These stories are so special

813
01:08:14.805 --> 01:08:16.845
And, and it's bringing out the, the character

814
01:08:16.985 --> 01:08:18.405
of our good buddy.

815
01:08:18.985 --> 01:08:21.565
My name is Greg Nelson. I'm from Carlsbad, California.

816
01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:26.445
Uh, I met Gary the summer of 1987

817
01:08:27.675 --> 01:08:29.285
when he sold his camera company

818
01:08:29.285 --> 01:08:31.805
that you learned about to Smith and Nephew.

819
01:08:32.335 --> 01:08:35.125
Later on that summer, I sold my company to Smith and Nephew.

820
01:08:35.555 --> 01:08:39.205
Earlier that year, Charlie was made president of Ionix,

821
01:08:39.205 --> 01:08:40.245
a Smith and nephew company.

822
01:08:41.225 --> 01:08:43.325
And the three Stooges were born

823
01:08:46.505 --> 01:08:49.565
36 years have passed since that time.

824
01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:52.365
And boy, they go quickly.

825
01:08:53.435 --> 01:08:56.445
I've got many, many stories, but I'm not gonna go there.

826
01:08:57.265 --> 01:08:58.805
I'm just gonna say that the best thing

827
01:08:58.805 --> 01:09:01.525
that happened in those 36 years is

828
01:09:01.525 --> 01:09:04.005
that our three wives fell in love with each other.

829
01:09:05.785 --> 01:09:09.605
And that has allowed us to travel, especially

830
01:09:09.605 --> 01:09:11.325
after we quit running companies and,

831
01:09:11.345 --> 01:09:12.765
and doing all the things that we were doing,

832
01:09:12.765 --> 01:09:14.325
raising families and so on.

833
01:09:15.065 --> 01:09:17.525
Uh, but we, especially the last few years, traveling

834
01:09:17.525 --> 01:09:20.805
to great resorts, playing lots of golf, drinking great wine,

835
01:09:21.145 --> 01:09:23.765
and having the times of our life, uh,

836
01:09:23.775 --> 01:09:25.485
we've even named it adult camp.

837
01:09:30.435 --> 01:09:35.325
Gary is a stud, I don't wanna say was 'cause he is a stud

838
01:09:36.385 --> 01:09:37.645
and he could do anything.

839
01:09:37.815 --> 01:09:40.085
We've, you've heard some of the stories of his partners.

840
01:09:40.745 --> 01:09:43.245
Um, and he's done many things for us.

841
01:09:44.385 --> 01:09:47.525
Uh, years ago, uh, Peggy and Gary were leaving Memphis.

842
01:09:49.225 --> 01:09:52.085
And I had a company in Dallas that was frankly in trouble.

843
01:09:52.225 --> 01:09:55.285
And I fired the CEO and I called Gary

844
01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:58.725
and I said, Gary, can you give me a hand?

845
01:09:59.005 --> 01:10:02.085
I said, you can do this job standing on your head.

846
01:10:03.505 --> 01:10:06.205
And he said, yeah, I, I'll give you a hand.

847
01:10:06.225 --> 01:10:08.445
So he was ACEO of this company,

848
01:10:09.185 --> 01:10:12.205
and it took him, it took him a little while.

849
01:10:12.205 --> 01:10:13.365
It wasn't standing on his head.

850
01:10:13.385 --> 01:10:15.045
It took him a while, but he got

851
01:10:15.045 --> 01:10:16.605
that ship turned all the way around.

852
01:10:17.345 --> 01:10:19.765
And, you know, he can do anything if you

853
01:10:19.765 --> 01:10:20.805
just give him the opportunity.

854
01:10:21.105 --> 01:10:22.205
But I remember him telling me,

855
01:10:22.505 --> 01:10:24.085
you gotta peel back the onion.

856
01:10:24.085 --> 01:10:25.925
You gotta look at it, peel back the onion

857
01:10:26.105 --> 01:10:27.245
and you figure things out.

858
01:10:32.435 --> 01:10:36.765
Gary loved his family, so proud of each one of you.

859
01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:39.165
And he would do anything, anything for any one of you.

860
01:10:40.665 --> 01:10:42.085
But he adored Peggy.

861
01:10:43.845 --> 01:10:46.085
I I would see him when Peggy would walk into the room

862
01:10:46.785 --> 01:10:48.005
and Gary would just smile.

863
01:10:48.655 --> 01:10:53.485
She's here. He, Gary, also loved all your, many, many,

864
01:10:53.555 --> 01:10:54.605
many girlfriends.

865
01:10:55.465 --> 01:10:57.165
And I heard stories. I was never there.

866
01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:00.005
But I heard stories of the visits to your homes,

867
01:11:00.665 --> 01:11:05.205
to the lake house where Gary would cook, clean,

868
01:11:06.075 --> 01:11:09.125
pour wine, always pouring wine.

869
01:11:09.125 --> 01:11:10.845
Matter of fact, last time Barbie

870
01:11:10.845 --> 01:11:15.005
and I were with Gary, um, a few months ago,

871
01:11:15.185 --> 01:11:17.285
he on his little machine, he said,

872
01:11:17.715 --> 01:11:20.205
anytime my my glass got half full of wine.

873
01:11:20.385 --> 01:11:22.405
He said, you need more wine. You need more wine.

874
01:11:22.425 --> 01:11:24.925
You need more wine. Yeah.

875
01:11:26.905 --> 01:11:31.285
But, you know, I don't know if heaven has hunting

876
01:11:31.505 --> 01:11:32.645
and fishing and golf,

877
01:11:33.585 --> 01:11:37.765
but if, if there is that in heaven, Gary's gotta be one

878
01:11:37.765 --> 01:11:38.965
of the best people there

879
01:11:38.965 --> 01:11:42.205
because he was so competitive in everything he ever did.

880
01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:46.285
And he was good at it. You know, many of us,

881
01:11:46.565 --> 01:11:48.445
probably most people in this room believe that

882
01:11:49.425 --> 01:11:51.325
God took Gary too soon,

883
01:11:52.945 --> 01:11:55.085
but God doesn't make any mistakes.

884
01:11:57.025 --> 01:11:59.165
And he's got a plan for each one of us.

885
01:12:00.345 --> 01:12:03.285
And I know I'll see Gary again soon,

886
01:12:04.225 --> 01:12:05.285
but I hope it's not tomorrow.

887
01:12:06.045 --> 01:12:07.165
I, I love you, man.

888
01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:50.065
Story of my life is following these three giants.

889
01:12:51.245 --> 01:12:55.785
Um, these are three giants in the

890
01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:58.665
industry and they're great men

891
01:12:59.445 --> 01:13:01.865
and they commanded a lot of attention.

892
01:13:04.725 --> 01:13:08.905
That's all over now. Um, I was grunt labor.

893
01:13:09.525 --> 01:13:14.145
Um, I, I, I don't know why, but, um, I'm up here.

894
01:13:15.785 --> 01:13:18.825
I love Gary so much. He hired me.

895
01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:22.665
Uh, well, I knew him for a long time.

896
01:13:23.245 --> 01:13:26.785
And we would meet at different meetings

897
01:13:26.785 --> 01:13:28.025
and we'd always play golf.

898
01:13:29.045 --> 01:13:31.105
And, uh, we'd drink wine

899
01:13:32.165 --> 01:13:34.705
and we'd play more golf, drink more wine.

900
01:13:35.565 --> 01:13:37.825
And, uh, we shared customers

901
01:13:38.645 --> 01:13:43.425
and we immediately, Lee had a kinship.

902
01:13:44.485 --> 01:13:45.745
And I loved him so much.

903
01:13:47.905 --> 01:13:50.825
I was born in North Carolina, um,

904
01:13:51.365 --> 01:13:53.665
and lived there for 10 years

905
01:13:53.665 --> 01:13:55.705
before I moved to Florida where I live now.

906
01:13:56.565 --> 01:14:00.985
And, um, my favorite thing to do there was to go over

907
01:14:00.985 --> 01:14:03.505
to my granddaddy's house, uh, Percy Smith.

908
01:14:03.725 --> 01:14:07.385
My father's dad had lots of cousins there.

909
01:14:08.045 --> 01:14:10.425
But, uh, I wanted to go to Granddaddy's.

910
01:14:11.245 --> 01:14:14.005
'cause when I got there, granddaddy stopped

911
01:14:14.005 --> 01:14:15.045
everything he was doing.

912
01:14:15.465 --> 01:14:19.125
He go, son, you need a, you, you don't have a

913
01:14:20.205 --> 01:14:21.405
a slingshot, do you?

914
01:14:22.385 --> 01:14:24.285
I'm gonna go make you the best slingshot.

915
01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:29.605
We'd go out to the shop and he'd, we'd go find a tree here

916
01:14:29.625 --> 01:14:32.125
or whatever he'd do, and he'd make me a slingshot.

917
01:14:32.465 --> 01:14:35.525
And then we'd spend most of the days practicing with it.

918
01:14:36.145 --> 01:14:39.405
But he stopped everything he did, and it was me.

919
01:14:40.545 --> 01:14:43.405
And I come again. He goes, you ever had a rubber band gun?

920
01:14:44.025 --> 01:14:46.605
Oh man, every kid's gotta have a rubber band gun.

921
01:14:47.035 --> 01:14:50.445
We'd go out to his shop, he'd make me a rubber band gun.

922
01:14:50.555 --> 01:14:55.045
We'd nail down a little, um, Uh,

923
01:14:55.045 --> 01:14:58.525
clothes hanger on thing, you know, and we'd make a, and

924
01:14:58.585 --> 01:15:00.645
and we had so much fun.

925
01:15:00.665 --> 01:15:04.805
As I got a little older, he'd say, I'm hungry.

926
01:15:04.895 --> 01:15:06.685
Let's go down to Piggly Wiggly.

927
01:15:07.305 --> 01:15:09.885
And, uh, he'd buy me a banana split.

928
01:15:11.085 --> 01:15:14.125
I, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.

929
01:15:14.385 --> 01:15:18.045
My dad wouldn't give me a snow cone.

930
01:15:18.145 --> 01:15:20.765
Uh, it was, he'd buy me a banana split.

931
01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:26.125
And, um, when I got a little older, when I hit 14, he said,

932
01:15:26.125 --> 01:15:27.325
let's go to piggy with.

933
01:15:27.505 --> 01:15:30.085
And I mean, he stopped everything.

934
01:15:31.185 --> 01:15:34.885
And his full attention was on me when I was young.

935
01:15:35.155 --> 01:15:37.805
He'd say, you know, buddy, I gotta go take a little nap.

936
01:15:38.465 --> 01:15:41.005
I'd complain. I'd sit outside the window

937
01:15:41.345 --> 01:15:43.325
and wait for him to wake up.

938
01:15:44.345 --> 01:15:47.445
Uh, he was the light of my life and I loved him so much.

939
01:15:47.985 --> 01:15:50.485
And, uh, and there were other cousins there in town.

940
01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:53.485
And, and so when I went to, um,

941
01:15:54.865 --> 01:15:56.885
my wife met him just before he passed,

942
01:15:57.105 --> 01:16:00.525
but um, when I was 14 years old, I went over

943
01:16:00.585 --> 01:16:02.605
and he says, let's go to Piggly Wiggly.

944
01:16:03.235 --> 01:16:04.485
Went to Piggly Wiggly.

945
01:16:04.905 --> 01:16:08.085
And, but we stopped on the way home

946
01:16:08.945 --> 01:16:10.285
and he bought two beers.

947
01:16:11.505 --> 01:16:13.805
And we went back to the house

948
01:16:14.065 --> 01:16:16.725
and we sat out under a China berry tree,

949
01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:21.325
Drank us two beers.

950
01:16:21.585 --> 01:16:22.685
And he looked over. He goes,

951
01:16:23.355 --> 01:16:25.325
your daddy doesn't need to know about this.

952
01:16:28.345 --> 01:16:30.645
He was so wonderful to me,

953
01:16:30.705 --> 01:16:33.645
and I loved him so dearly when he passed,

954
01:16:34.125 --> 01:16:35.325
I was there with all my cousins.

955
01:16:37.585 --> 01:16:39.885
And the whole time I was there thinking, you know,

956
01:16:40.555 --> 01:16:42.285
this has gotta be painful for them.

957
01:16:43.425 --> 01:16:44.885
You know, 'cause I was his favorite.

958
01:16:47.345 --> 01:16:49.405
And then they started sharing stories

959
01:16:50.065 --> 01:16:53.765
and I found out I was just one of,

960
01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:57.765
they all were, he loved all of 'em.

961
01:16:58.185 --> 01:17:01.125
And he, I still think I was his favorite,

962
01:17:01.425 --> 01:17:05.365
but I mean, they were all special to him.

963
01:17:05.585 --> 01:17:08.285
And he took the time with every one of 'em.

964
01:17:09.245 --> 01:17:11.645
I found out that today

965
01:17:11.905 --> 01:17:14.205
or the last couple of days, being around Gary

966
01:17:14.265 --> 01:17:18.405
and his friends and his family, how much he poured his life

967
01:17:19.435 --> 01:17:24.085
into all his friends, and I mean, poured his life in it.

968
01:17:25.345 --> 01:17:29.965
Now, unlike these three giants, I was grunt labor.

969
01:17:30.745 --> 01:17:34.165
Um, I had a little old dinky company that I started,

970
01:17:34.545 --> 01:17:37.565
and I'm just jumping in many years down the road.

971
01:17:38.625 --> 01:17:41.725
And, uh, Gary was president at Orthofix

972
01:17:41.725 --> 01:17:46.685
and Charlie was the CEOI had a, um,

973
01:17:47.275 --> 01:17:48.885
basically a billing company.

974
01:17:49.225 --> 01:17:54.085
And when I ran up, I billed a lot. I collected some of it.

975
01:17:54.745 --> 01:17:58.405
And, uh, I had a giant debt in buying

976
01:17:58.565 --> 01:18:00.205
products and inventory.

977
01:18:00.505 --> 01:18:03.685
But, you know, I said, you know, you guys have got this, uh,

978
01:18:04.285 --> 01:18:06.125
gigantic Titanic kind of boat.

979
01:18:06.125 --> 01:18:08.445
You've only filled a half of the things.

980
01:18:08.505 --> 01:18:10.805
And I said, you need my business

981
01:18:11.725 --> 01:18:13.365
'cause you're a big billing operation.

982
01:18:14.425 --> 01:18:17.525
And, uh, as I was sitting here selling my brains out, uh,

983
01:18:17.665 --> 01:18:21.405
to Charlie and Gary at breakfast, Charlie sits back

984
01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:23.925
and goes, well, I can write a check.

985
01:18:25.345 --> 01:18:28.445
And that was it. And he goes, Gary, check it out.

986
01:18:28.985 --> 01:18:32.125
And so Gary and I went

987
01:18:32.265 --> 01:18:35.525
and did all the due diligence for doing all this.

988
01:18:36.185 --> 01:18:37.645
And Gary bought my little company.

989
01:18:38.545 --> 01:18:42.685
And, uh, and from then on

990
01:18:43.375 --> 01:18:47.005
every company Gary went to, I'd get a phone call,

991
01:18:47.905 --> 01:18:52.285
we got a job for you, Mikey, and, uh, it's more money.

992
01:18:52.505 --> 01:18:54.485
You're gonna like it. You can do it.

993
01:18:55.265 --> 01:18:58.365
And, and it was a wonderful relationship.

994
01:18:58.905 --> 01:19:02.005
And every time I'd do it, I'd go, Hey, Gary,

995
01:19:02.285 --> 01:19:04.525
I don't know anything about that.

996
01:19:04.635 --> 01:19:09.485
I've never done relax. It's easy. You can do it.

997
01:19:09.935 --> 01:19:12.645
We'll do it together. And it's, it, eh, you got it.

998
01:19:12.785 --> 01:19:16.725
It, I was scared to death, you know, he hired me at, uh,

999
01:19:17.495 --> 01:19:22.065
right medical, and I'd never sold a total

1000
01:19:22.115 --> 01:19:23.425
joint or an implant.

1001
01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:26.505
Or he says, I'm not hiring you to do that.

1002
01:19:27.145 --> 01:19:29.865
I want you to manage all these distributors.

1003
01:19:31.005 --> 01:19:34.305
And I had the whole south region, which was from

1004
01:19:35.175 --> 01:19:38.665
Arizona over to, you know, Florida and down.

1005
01:19:38.765 --> 01:19:43.345
And Gary made it easy.

1006
01:19:44.005 --> 01:19:46.145
He worked me like a mule.

1007
01:19:46.685 --> 01:19:48.105
Uh, keeping up

1008
01:19:48.105 --> 01:19:50.865
with Gary was the hardest thing I'd ever done in my life.

1009
01:19:51.255 --> 01:19:55.865
That was the hardest working that man I've ever met.

1010
01:19:56.405 --> 01:19:59.065
He would, and I thought I was a hardworking guy.

1011
01:20:00.175 --> 01:20:01.425
Gary would smoke you.

1012
01:20:02.205 --> 01:20:05.625
He absolutely would wear you out.

1013
01:20:08.425 --> 01:20:11.085
But after a while, drinking a lot of wine.

1014
01:20:11.595 --> 01:20:15.405
When I moved to Texas, I gotta tell you this, I I moved

1015
01:20:16.065 --> 01:20:17.285
two blocks away from him.

1016
01:20:18.305 --> 01:20:22.565
And I lived at their house. I had a room at their house.

1017
01:20:24.125 --> 01:20:29.045
I ate all his food. I drank all his wine, and it was great.

1018
01:20:29.545 --> 01:20:34.165
We went to play golf after work every day.

1019
01:20:35.065 --> 01:20:38.085
And, uh, he, he, we'd go out to Hurricane Creek

1020
01:20:38.825 --> 01:20:43.285
and, uh, we'd check in Gary, go to his locker

1021
01:20:43.385 --> 01:20:45.125
and had Gary Henley on it.

1022
01:20:45.505 --> 01:20:50.205
You know, I changed out in the car and we'd go play golf.

1023
01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:54.805
And Gary always, he paid and he'd pay.

1024
01:20:54.905 --> 01:20:58.925
And we went months of going to play golf.

1025
01:20:59.185 --> 01:21:02.165
And every Saturday, every day after work.

1026
01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:05.285
And he, and then one day he said to me, he says, uh,

1027
01:21:06.485 --> 01:21:10.085
I have bribed everybody on the membership team.

1028
01:21:11.385 --> 01:21:12.725
You're gonna get a membership.

1029
01:21:13.365 --> 01:21:14.885
I said, I'm tired of paying for you.

1030
01:21:15.645 --> 01:21:18.965
I said, man, I thought we had something going here.

1031
01:21:20.985 --> 01:21:24.565
So, uh, and I was an okay golfer. I wasn't a great golfer.

1032
01:21:24.595 --> 01:21:25.885
Gary was a great golfer.

1033
01:21:26.825 --> 01:21:29.845
Uh, I went

1034
01:21:29.845 --> 01:21:31.565
and played almost a,

1035
01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:35.685
I know 10 member guests out in Arizona with him.

1036
01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:39.485
He paid for my flights in and out.

1037
01:21:39.485 --> 01:21:40.565
He knew I didn't have any money.

1038
01:21:41.405 --> 01:21:43.605
I ate like a God while I was there.

1039
01:21:44.475 --> 01:21:49.445
Gary paid for all of it, drank some of the finest fluid.

1040
01:21:50.545 --> 01:21:53.605
And, um, Gary paid for all of it,

1041
01:21:54.345 --> 01:21:55.645
and he'd bring my wife.

1042
01:21:57.105 --> 01:21:58.645
It was, um, and

1043
01:21:58.765 --> 01:22:01.645
that was just the way it went our whole lives.

1044
01:22:02.355 --> 01:22:06.525
Gary just poured into my life and loved on me.

1045
01:22:07.625 --> 01:22:10.165
One of my favorite stories is when we got to Texas,

1046
01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:13.325
and really the greatest compliment Gary ever gave me,

1047
01:22:13.325 --> 01:22:17.365
and he doesn't know it was, uh, Mikey,

1048
01:22:17.525 --> 01:22:18.925
I know you're a religious guy.

1049
01:22:19.585 --> 01:22:22.525
He goes, um, you wanna go to church with us?

1050
01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:26.965
Um, I said, well, yeah. I said, where are your church?

1051
01:22:27.105 --> 01:22:29.685
He goes, it's out in Frisco. I said, who's the pastor?

1052
01:22:29.865 --> 01:22:34.245
He goes, I, it's kind of a famous guy.

1053
01:22:34.525 --> 01:22:38.565
I, I'm not sure. I was like, not sure.

1054
01:22:39.545 --> 01:22:40.925
So I said, sure. And he goes,

1055
01:22:40.925 --> 01:22:42.125
we'll go out to eat afterwards.

1056
01:22:42.265 --> 01:22:47.085
Of course he paid. And, uh, Gloria and I get into church.

1057
01:22:47.945 --> 01:22:50.245
Now, to back up a little bit, Gloria

1058
01:22:50.345 --> 01:22:54.325
and I, we've been married in three weeks, 53 years.

1059
01:22:54.855 --> 01:22:56.085
She's the love of my life.

1060
01:22:57.025 --> 01:23:00.885
But when I was a young hospital corpsman out in California,

1061
01:23:01.345 --> 01:23:04.765
we were driving down the road and we had some preaching on,

1062
01:23:05.305 --> 01:23:07.565
and there's a guy named Chuck Swindoll

1063
01:23:07.865 --> 01:23:10.525
who was preaching on the radio.

1064
01:23:11.465 --> 01:23:13.245
And I looked at her and I said,

1065
01:23:14.235 --> 01:23:17.925
I've never in my life heard the Bible taught like that.

1066
01:23:18.605 --> 01:23:20.725
I said, I've gotta start reading the Bible.

1067
01:23:21.345 --> 01:23:24.085
He, he brought the scripture to life,

1068
01:23:24.385 --> 01:23:27.125
and I mean, it was alive.

1069
01:23:27.385 --> 01:23:29.885
It was something that I'd never experienced.

1070
01:23:30.545 --> 01:23:33.765
So we walk into the church, we get the little

1071
01:23:35.335 --> 01:23:38.445
chuck swindle, and I'm like, can't be.

1072
01:23:39.025 --> 01:23:43.525
And then up comes his booming voice

1073
01:23:43.705 --> 01:23:45.245
and his chuck swindle,

1074
01:23:45.975 --> 01:23:47.085
Chuck Swindle.

1075
01:23:47.585 --> 01:23:48.845
Gloria and I were like,

1076
01:23:48.905 --> 01:23:50.165
Uh, you know,

1077
01:23:50.165 --> 01:23:52.765
we were going crazy. We looked at each other,

1078
01:23:53.705 --> 01:23:56.045
You know, Gary, I'm sure thought we were nuts.

1079
01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:59.285
And of course we went every Sunday after that.

1080
01:23:59.585 --> 01:24:01.565
And we told him all about, you know,

1081
01:24:01.665 --> 01:24:03.125
our relationship with Chuck.

1082
01:24:03.225 --> 01:24:05.765
And so we went to Chuck. I joined the choir.

1083
01:24:05.865 --> 01:24:08.045
It was, you know, we went over and over

1084
01:24:08.105 --> 01:24:12.205
and I would watch Gary listening to the greatest

1085
01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:16.485
Bible expository in I've ever heard in my life.

1086
01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:19.965
And, uh, I'd look over him sometimes

1087
01:24:20.145 --> 01:24:21.765
and there'd be a tear there.

1088
01:24:22.545 --> 01:24:25.405
So, um, but Gary's a man's man,

1089
01:24:25.825 --> 01:24:29.165
and, uh, he's real tough.

1090
01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:33.365
It, he's, he's about as cuddly as a rattlesnake.

1091
01:24:33.645 --> 01:24:36.005
I mean, grabbing a hold of him and loving him.

1092
01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:38.765
It was, it was hard.

1093
01:24:38.825 --> 01:24:41.125
You know, I'm, I come from a lovey-dovey family

1094
01:24:41.305 --> 01:24:43.885
and oh man, you know.

1095
01:24:44.465 --> 01:24:47.765
So, um, as we got along and we separated

1096
01:24:47.785 --> 01:24:50.165
and went our own ways doing things in the world,

1097
01:24:50.305 --> 01:24:51.965
and I retired

1098
01:24:52.345 --> 01:24:55.925
and, um, I talked to Gary.

1099
01:24:56.195 --> 01:24:58.045
We'd talk almost every day,

1100
01:24:58.585 --> 01:25:01.645
and he would say things that I thought were unique to me.

1101
01:25:01.745 --> 01:25:05.565
But then I found out all you guys,

1102
01:25:06.955 --> 01:25:10.445
he'd call me from prayer rock where he was walking up,

1103
01:25:10.935 --> 01:25:12.845
where he'd walk a million miles every day

1104
01:25:13.145 --> 01:25:15.485
and he'd walk up this mountain up to

1105
01:25:15.485 --> 01:25:16.845
what he called prayer rock.

1106
01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:19.885
And he'd tell me some of the things

1107
01:25:19.885 --> 01:25:21.485
that he was so grateful for.

1108
01:25:22.065 --> 01:25:23.325
And I'm so blessed,

1109
01:25:23.865 --> 01:25:27.765
and he uses all these Jesus words without using

1110
01:25:27.865 --> 01:25:28.885
the Jesus word.

1111
01:25:29.545 --> 01:25:33.205
But he was so in love with life,

1112
01:25:33.785 --> 01:25:37.845
and he was so appreciative of everything that he had.

1113
01:25:38.705 --> 01:25:42.165
And, um, and he called me sometimes just crying.

1114
01:25:43.765 --> 01:25:46.085
I don't know why. I don't know why.

1115
01:25:46.865 --> 01:25:48.845
And, uh, I go, I know why, you know?

1116
01:25:48.905 --> 01:25:53.525
But, uh, so I decided what I was gonna start doing

1117
01:25:54.665 --> 01:25:59.605
is when we'd talk, I'd end it with saying, Gary, I love you.

1118
01:26:00.865 --> 01:26:03.685
And he'd go, I'll see you, Mike.

1119
01:26:03.745 --> 01:26:08.165
Uh, it was like pulling hen's teeth, you know,

1120
01:26:08.625 --> 01:26:10.165
but I persevered.

1121
01:26:10.505 --> 01:26:12.405
And every time I'd hang up, I'd go,

1122
01:26:12.865 --> 01:26:14.045
all right buddy, I gotta go.

1123
01:26:14.165 --> 01:26:18.365
I love you, man. After a while it was love you too.

1124
01:26:21.625 --> 01:26:22.645
It was hard.

1125
01:26:24.545 --> 01:26:29.325
But after a while, years, I love you too, Mikey,

1126
01:26:30.225 --> 01:26:31.805
and I love you.

1127
01:26:31.805 --> 01:26:33.885
Care boy, love you too, buddy.

1128
01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:37.325
And it got easier and easier.

1129
01:26:37.785 --> 01:26:42.205
And when we'd get together, I could hug him

1130
01:26:42.745 --> 01:26:46.445
and he wouldn't pull away or do this, you know?

1131
01:26:47.185 --> 01:26:51.245
But, um, finding that soft spot for Gary

1132
01:26:52.945 --> 01:26:56.885
was easy in one respect, but tough in another.

1133
01:26:57.825 --> 01:26:58.045
Um,

1134
01:27:01.535 --> 01:27:03.015
ALS was horrible.

1135
01:27:03.635 --> 01:27:05.615
And like Erick said, it's, it's,

1136
01:27:06.115 --> 01:27:08.175
that's a disease from health.

1137
01:27:09.035 --> 01:27:13.535
Um, his mind stays sharp and has his body deteriorated.

1138
01:27:14.715 --> 01:27:18.735
Um, but I know, well,

1139
01:27:18.735 --> 01:27:19.815
you'll talk more about this,

1140
01:27:19.875 --> 01:27:23.215
but I mean, I know my brother's in heaven

1141
01:27:24.715 --> 01:27:28.735
and, uh, I guess I'm gonna finally

1142
01:27:28.735 --> 01:27:29.855
have to go to my notes.

1143
01:27:31.515 --> 01:27:34.255
You guys ruined it for me, but well, I won't do it now.

1144
01:27:35.115 --> 01:27:39.895
It is, it's in the Bible about a,

1145
01:27:40.095 --> 01:27:44.615
a story about a parable that Jesus tells about

1146
01:27:46.005 --> 01:27:49.455
Lazarus and the rich man.

1147
01:27:51.035 --> 01:27:54.935
And I won't tell you the whole story. You probably know it.

1148
01:27:55.055 --> 01:27:56.255
Well, I'll tell you most of it.

1149
01:27:58.325 --> 01:28:01.375
Lazarus sat outside the rich man's

1150
01:28:03.025 --> 01:28:06.815
place and he was a beggar, didn't have anything.

1151
01:28:07.195 --> 01:28:10.815
And the rich man had everything ate

1152
01:28:12.135 --> 01:28:15.695
anything you wanted, ate well dressed in

1153
01:28:18.195 --> 01:28:20.365
Luxurious robes and whatnot.

1154
01:28:21.465 --> 01:28:24.205
And, uh, Lazarus died.

1155
01:28:25.265 --> 01:28:28.765
And the story that reminds me so much of Gary here

1156
01:28:29.945 --> 01:28:34.045
is it said when he died, angels

1157
01:28:35.275 --> 01:28:36.365
came and grabbed him

1158
01:28:37.425 --> 01:28:40.965
and took him up to Abraham's bosom.

1159
01:28:42.505 --> 01:28:47.245
And I imagine angels carrying my

1160
01:28:47.245 --> 01:28:48.765
brother up to heaven.

1161
01:28:49.605 --> 01:28:51.965
'cause that's what happened when he died.

1162
01:28:53.265 --> 01:28:57.005
In Colossians first chapter,

1163
01:28:57.695 --> 01:29:00.285
about 21st, 22nd verse, somewhere in there,

1164
01:29:01.505 --> 01:29:04.965
it tells a story about how when you received Jesus Christ,

1165
01:29:07.905 --> 01:29:12.125
you're now, you're now a creature

1166
01:29:13.025 --> 01:29:14.845
of heaven on earth.

1167
01:29:15.685 --> 01:29:17.845
Eternity began right then.

1168
01:29:19.225 --> 01:29:20.725
And it says that one day

1169
01:29:23.975 --> 01:29:27.475
Christ is going to introduce me

1170
01:29:29.135 --> 01:29:31.955
in this case, Gary, to the Father,

1171
01:29:32.335 --> 01:29:36.875
and say, I want you to meet Mike Smith.

1172
01:29:37.755 --> 01:29:39.555
I want you to meet Gary Henley.

1173
01:29:40.495 --> 01:29:43.715
He is perfect, flawless,

1174
01:29:44.865 --> 01:29:46.915
without any blemish.

1175
01:29:48.145 --> 01:29:51.715
This is the Father. And you say, well, how is that?

1176
01:29:51.985 --> 01:29:55.555
It's because God doesn't see Gary anymore.

1177
01:29:55.695 --> 01:29:59.395
He doesn't see me. What he sees is Jesus Christ.

1178
01:29:59.905 --> 01:30:03.395
When you accept Christ, you take on Christ.

1179
01:30:04.655 --> 01:30:08.555
And, um, I disagree in that.

1180
01:30:08.635 --> 01:30:11.875
I don't think there's any fishing in heaven or hunting.

1181
01:30:13.155 --> 01:30:17.765
I think the Bible teaches that there's no marriage,

1182
01:30:18.795 --> 01:30:22.605
that, um, we know our spouse.

1183
01:30:23.705 --> 01:30:26.365
And, but it's a better relationship

1184
01:30:26.435 --> 01:30:27.725
than it is here on earth.

1185
01:30:28.585 --> 01:30:33.325
And rather than a corporation, um, brothers, sisters,

1186
01:30:33.695 --> 01:30:37.605
aunts, uncles, It's um, it's a marriage.

1187
01:30:37.985 --> 01:30:41.165
And Christ is at the center. It's like spokes.

1188
01:30:41.625 --> 01:30:43.685
And we're all married to Christ.

1189
01:30:44.585 --> 01:30:49.405
And it is, as it says in Revelations 22nd chapter,

1190
01:30:50.355 --> 01:30:51.645
it's the story of nose.

1191
01:30:53.105 --> 01:30:56.005
No more pain, no more sorrow.

1192
01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:58.685
Gary's got his voice back,

1193
01:31:01.655 --> 01:31:05.395
no crying, no agony, forever,

1194
01:31:06.485 --> 01:31:08.555
peace with Jesus Christ.

1195
01:31:09.335 --> 01:31:13.035
And I love that. And I loved my brother.

1196
01:31:13.985 --> 01:31:16.315
It's, um, he gave me

1197
01:31:17.455 --> 01:31:19.795
and my family so much

1198
01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:22.675
that it cannot be covered.

1199
01:31:23.055 --> 01:31:23.875
30 some

1200
01:31:26.935 --> 01:31:28.205
years that we were together.

1201
01:31:29.865 --> 01:31:31.725
But why I'm here, I don't know.

1202
01:31:32.675 --> 01:31:35.405
Gary had so many powerful, mighty friends

1203
01:31:36.305 --> 01:31:41.205
and why one of his dinging ball employees is up here

1204
01:31:41.225 --> 01:31:45.965
and why he loved me is a mystery, mystery to you guys too.

1205
01:31:46.085 --> 01:31:48.165
I know. Thank you so much.

1206
01:32:20.455 --> 01:32:24.295
I had only known last time would be the last time

1207
01:32:26.135 --> 01:32:29.615
I would've put off all the things I had to do.

1208
01:32:31.735 --> 01:32:36.615
I would've stayed a little, a little.

1209
01:32:38.275 --> 01:32:41.895
Now what I give for one more day with you,

1210
01:32:46.525 --> 01:32:49.415
Because There's a wound here in my heart where

1211
01:32:50.245 --> 01:32:51.255
something's missing

1212
01:32:53.155 --> 01:32:57.335
and they tell me that it's gonna heal with time.

1213
01:32:59.195 --> 01:33:01.095
But I know you are in a place

1214
01:33:01.665 --> 01:33:04.335
where all your wounds have been erased.

1215
01:33:05.195 --> 01:33:08.095
And knowing yours are healed, is healing

1216
01:33:08.325 --> 01:33:09.325
Mine.

1217
01:33:09.675 --> 01:33:12.495
The only scars in heaven,

1218
01:33:15.145 --> 01:33:17.435
they won't belong to me.

1219
01:33:17.775 --> 01:33:22.715
And you, There'll be no such

1220
01:33:22.805 --> 01:33:24.395
thing is broken

1221
01:33:27.015 --> 01:33:28.515
and all the will

1222
01:33:30.695 --> 01:33:33.035
and the thought that makes me smile

1223
01:33:36.665 --> 01:33:36.955
even

1224
01:33:42.575 --> 01:33:44.675
is that the only scars in

1225
01:33:45.055 --> 01:33:49.515
heaven on the hands.

1226
01:33:56.115 --> 01:34:00.275
I know the road you walked was anything but easy.

1227
01:34:02.385 --> 01:34:05.115
Drop your share of scar along

1228
01:34:05.735 --> 01:34:08.395
the way open.

1229
01:34:08.655 --> 01:34:12.555
Now you're standing in the sun, you fought your fight

1230
01:34:12.655 --> 01:34:13.995
and your races run.

1231
01:34:14.335 --> 01:34:17.635
The pain is all a million miles away.

1232
01:34:19.055 --> 01:34:19.475
The only

1233
01:34:23.945 --> 01:34:25.835
they won't belong to

1234
01:34:25.935 --> 01:34:26.935
Me. And

1235
01:34:26.935 --> 01:34:27.515
you,

1236
01:34:30.155 --> 01:34:33.235
There'll be no such thing is broken

1237
01:34:36.095 --> 01:34:37.275
and all the old.

1238
01:34:39.455 --> 01:34:43.155
And the thought that makes me smile now

1239
01:34:48.465 --> 01:34:52.475
down is that the only

1240
01:34:53.045 --> 01:34:57.965
scars in heaven on

1241
01:34:57.965 --> 01:34:59.885
the hands of hold now

1242
01:35:01.455 --> 01:35:01.745
Hall,

1243
01:35:13.215 --> 01:35:13.505
hall

1244
01:35:18.525 --> 01:35:19.825
Are on the hands of,

1245
01:35:23.455 --> 01:35:27.225
there's not a day goes by that I don't see you,

1246
01:35:28.925 --> 01:35:32.665
you live on and all the better parts of me

1247
01:35:34.955 --> 01:35:37.825
until I'm standing with you in the sun.

1248
01:35:38.215 --> 01:35:40.505
I'll fight this, fight in this race all

1249
01:35:41.315 --> 01:35:44.945
until I finally see what you can see.

1250
01:35:46.725 --> 01:35:50.505
Oh, you only scars in,

1251
01:35:54.055 --> 01:35:56.025
they won't belong to me.

1252
01:35:56.325 --> 01:35:57.425
And you.

1253
01:36:00.225 --> 01:36:03.305
There'll be no such thing is broken.

1254
01:36:06.305 --> 01:36:08.565
All the old would be made new.

1255
01:36:09.425 --> 01:36:13.365
And the God that makes me smile now

1256
01:36:15.625 --> 01:36:17.475
even fall

1257
01:36:18.265 --> 01:36:19.265
Down.

1258
01:36:21.935 --> 01:36:24.555
Is that the only scars in

1259
01:36:24.655 --> 01:36:28.435
heaven on the hands?

1260
01:37:13.255 --> 01:37:17.875
Hi everybody. I am Isabelle. I am one of IESs daughters.

1261
01:37:19.455 --> 01:37:22.235
And, um, all these stories are wonderful.

1262
01:37:22.295 --> 01:37:25.675
Of all the things that throughout the years, Pappy

1263
01:37:25.675 --> 01:37:26.675
and everybody has done.

1264
01:37:27.335 --> 01:37:30.595
Um, my story tonight is actually about last

1265
01:37:30.595 --> 01:37:32.115
weekend randomly.

1266
01:37:32.455 --> 01:37:35.875
Um, I told Grammy that I was gonna go to Bedlam

1267
01:37:35.875 --> 01:37:38.835
and go to Stillwater and get to go to the last one.

1268
01:37:39.175 --> 01:37:43.475
And she told me that she had some of Pappy's pullovers,

1269
01:37:44.375 --> 01:37:46.715
and if I wanted to have one, I could take them

1270
01:37:46.735 --> 01:37:47.755
and I could wear it to the game.

1271
01:37:48.535 --> 01:37:51.275
So of course I was like, I would love to bring Pappy

1272
01:37:51.415 --> 01:37:53.915
to Stillwater to bring 'em there with us on the last one.

1273
01:37:55.225 --> 01:37:57.925
So I put on that pullover, I went up

1274
01:37:57.925 --> 01:38:00.125
to Stillwater, I watched the game.

1275
01:38:00.125 --> 01:38:01.845
We got to tail, well, we got to tailgate,

1276
01:38:02.385 --> 01:38:03.565
um, and hang out there.

1277
01:38:04.025 --> 01:38:05.685
And Cole and I didn't have tickets.

1278
01:38:06.305 --> 01:38:10.805
So we were gonna go back to the refuge to watch the game,

1279
01:38:11.345 --> 01:38:13.805
um, hang out with family and spend time there.

1280
01:38:14.745 --> 01:38:15.885
And right when we're leaving,

1281
01:38:15.885 --> 01:38:18.365
Stillwater headed up to the refuge.

1282
01:38:19.155 --> 01:38:23.885
Cole gets a trail cam picture of a buck. And so we see this.

1283
01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:27.725
I look down, I'm in jeans, my pullover in boots,

1284
01:38:28.105 --> 01:38:31.245
and I was like, should we go sit in the sand right now

1285
01:38:32.225 --> 01:38:33.365
on this day on bed?

1286
01:38:33.485 --> 01:38:35.405
Bum, the game hasn't even started yet. Should we go?

1287
01:38:36.345 --> 01:38:40.045
So we raced all the way to the refuge, get in the stand.

1288
01:38:40.825 --> 01:38:42.885
I'm wearing my pappy's pullover feeling

1289
01:38:42.945 --> 01:38:43.965
all good and confident.

1290
01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:46.685
And, uh, we're watching the game,

1291
01:38:46.825 --> 01:38:48.845
the O Ssu game in the Stand in the Blind,

1292
01:38:49.465 --> 01:38:52.685
and, um, hoping that OSU pulls out something great.

1293
01:38:53.505 --> 01:38:55.405
And so as we're standing there, we're not even in there

1294
01:38:55.505 --> 01:38:57.885
for an hour and a butt comes out

1295
01:38:58.745 --> 01:39:02.445
and right then took the shot, made it, shot it.

1296
01:39:02.565 --> 01:39:07.405
I don't know what you say. And, um, my dad came with us

1297
01:39:07.585 --> 01:39:09.805
and came and went and got the deer.

1298
01:39:09.985 --> 01:39:11.525
We put it right in the back of the truck,

1299
01:39:11.985 --> 01:39:13.605
had been right back to the refuge

1300
01:39:14.025 --> 01:39:15.605
and caught the fourth quarter of the game

1301
01:39:15.705 --> 01:39:17.165
to see the wonderful thing happen.

1302
01:39:17.745 --> 01:39:21.365
The popes winning. And this entire time

1303
01:39:22.065 --> 01:39:24.205
I'm wearing something that meant so, so much to me.

1304
01:39:34.255 --> 01:39:36.565
Sorry. Um,

1305
01:39:38.915 --> 01:39:39.965
that entire day.

1306
01:39:40.945 --> 01:39:45.405
Oh, okay. That entire day we got to do three

1307
01:39:45.955 --> 01:39:48.725
wonderful things that meant so much to my pap.

1308
01:39:49.945 --> 01:39:53.685
We were in Stillwater at OSU, um, we got to go hunting

1309
01:39:54.665 --> 01:39:58.725
and most of all, um, we got to spend time

1310
01:39:58.725 --> 01:40:00.925
with family and I'll be there together.

1311
01:40:01.625 --> 01:40:03.205
And I know how much that means to him

1312
01:40:05.025 --> 01:40:06.325
and how much it means to me.

1313
01:40:07.265 --> 01:40:12.085
And now I know also if I ever need a little bit of luck

1314
01:40:12.225 --> 01:40:14.605
and a little bit of my pappy, I just need to put

1315
01:40:14.605 --> 01:40:17.685
that pullover on and I'm gonna be right by him.

1316
01:40:18.435 --> 01:40:18.725
Okay?

1317
01:40:27.625 --> 01:40:29.765
My name's Caroline Graham, um,

1318
01:40:30.545 --> 01:40:32.885
and I had the immense pleasure

1319
01:40:33.185 --> 01:40:36.565
of being an honorary granddaughter

1320
01:40:37.665 --> 01:40:39.525
To both Pappy and Grammy.

1321
01:40:41.845 --> 01:40:45.805
I wanna share a story about Poppy's

1322
01:40:46.765 --> 01:40:50.205
overwhelming generosity

1323
01:40:50.675 --> 01:40:53.165
that I think we've heard some stories of already,

1324
01:40:53.825 --> 01:40:55.925
but I wanna share a peace of mind.

1325
01:40:57.105 --> 01:41:00.925
Um, when I was 16 years old,

1326
01:41:01.755 --> 01:41:03.445
life circumstances happened

1327
01:41:03.945 --> 01:41:07.325
and I ended up moving into my aunt

1328
01:41:07.325 --> 01:41:08.925
and uncle's house, Katie and Eric.

1329
01:41:10.545 --> 01:41:14.685
And it just so happened that that same year, it was

1330
01:41:15.345 --> 01:41:20.325
spring of, um, it was springtime when I moved in with them

1331
01:41:20.505 --> 01:41:21.885
and there was a trip planned.

1332
01:41:22.605 --> 01:41:25.165
Henley's had planned this amazing trip to Hawaii

1333
01:41:25.235 --> 01:41:29.045
that coming summer, um, just a few months,

1334
01:41:30.385 --> 01:41:31.525
um, a head

1335
01:41:32.825 --> 01:41:37.445
and I had just moved in with them

1336
01:41:37.545 --> 01:41:40.365
and it was kind of a weird situation.

1337
01:41:40.585 --> 01:41:43.245
And I remember Grammy and Pappy came into town

1338
01:41:43.745 --> 01:41:48.165
and they handed me an envelope at the house

1339
01:41:49.225 --> 01:41:51.645
and I opened up this envelope

1340
01:41:52.025 --> 01:41:54.645
and it was a, a ticket to Hawaii.

1341
01:41:59.835 --> 01:42:01.175
And it meant so much to me.

1342
01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:04.575
Not only 'cause I got to go to Hawaii, which was awesome,

1343
01:42:06.235 --> 01:42:08.975
but because I had just gotten there

1344
01:42:09.035 --> 01:42:13.015
and I felt so overwhelmed

1345
01:42:13.605 --> 01:42:17.375
with the love and generosity that they took me in

1346
01:42:17.375 --> 01:42:20.335
and immediately treated me like one of their own.

1347
01:42:21.675 --> 01:42:25.175
And I can say from that day forward, I always felt that

1348
01:42:27.035 --> 01:42:28.375
By both Pappy and Grammy.

1349
01:42:29.875 --> 01:42:32.535
And I just wanted to share how much it meant to me

1350
01:42:33.315 --> 01:42:38.215
and just share the blessings that Pappy continued

1351
01:42:38.215 --> 01:42:39.615
to pour out into my life

1352
01:42:40.075 --> 01:42:43.735
and into everyone's life that he touched

1353
01:42:45.555 --> 01:42:46.935
and what a blessing he was

1354
01:42:47.595 --> 01:42:49.575
and a truly generous,

1355
01:42:49.955 --> 01:42:54.055
loving man and Pappy.

1356
01:42:57.165 --> 01:42:59.855
Alright everybody, um, I am

1357
01:43:00.535 --> 01:43:05.055
Ellison Henley now Marler and Pappy's oldest granddaughter.

1358
01:43:06.275 --> 01:43:08.775
And I want to share something with you all.

1359
01:43:08.855 --> 01:43:10.175
I really hope that it works.

1360
01:43:10.595 --> 01:43:14.215
Um, but about five years ago I received

1361
01:43:14.975 --> 01:43:17.655
a phone call from Pappy that unfortunately I missed,

1362
01:43:17.875 --> 01:43:20.655
but now fortunately I have saved on my phone forever.

1363
01:43:22.075 --> 01:43:26.215
Um, five years ago I was accepted into medical school,

1364
01:43:26.215 --> 01:43:28.135
which is a great accomplishment,

1365
01:43:28.275 --> 01:43:32.655
but I think that having his voice share with you

1366
01:43:32.655 --> 01:43:35.895
what an accomplishment was for him, um, is even greater.

1367
01:43:36.155 --> 01:43:39.255
So I hope it works and I hope you guys can hear it today.

1368
01:43:42.845 --> 01:43:45.055
Well, I got the news. Congratulations.

1369
01:43:45.515 --> 01:43:47.975
I'm so happy for you. Yeah.

1370
01:43:49.685 --> 01:43:53.085
Love you girl, making me cry.

1371
01:43:54.805 --> 01:43:56.045
I love you. Take care.

1372
01:44:07.905 --> 01:44:09.635
This is special for a lot of reasons.

1373
01:44:11.335 --> 01:44:14.275
As many of you know, he lost his

1374
01:44:14.275 --> 01:44:15.795
voice at the end of his life.

1375
01:44:17.215 --> 01:44:22.195
And so to be able to listen to him strong and happy

1376
01:44:23.455 --> 01:44:26.035
and joyful is so, so precious.

1377
01:44:27.015 --> 01:44:28.595
And that's the first thing that means

1378
01:44:28.615 --> 01:44:29.715
so much to me about this.

1379
01:44:31.255 --> 01:44:35.595
But the second thing is that what we've heard today from all

1380
01:44:35.595 --> 01:44:40.075
of you amazing men, is that Pappy was incredibly hardworking

1381
01:44:41.255 --> 01:44:44.955
and persistent in everything that he did in his work,

1382
01:44:45.815 --> 01:44:48.595
his family, and every part of his life.

1383
01:44:49.855 --> 01:44:52.315
We got to share a lot of that as we talked about medicine.

1384
01:44:52.335 --> 01:44:54.275
And I learned about his accomplishments

1385
01:44:54.295 --> 01:44:57.235
and finally understood what all of these weird words meant.

1386
01:44:58.495 --> 01:45:00.675
But his persistence

1387
01:45:00.675 --> 01:45:03.115
and his hard work is something that I aim to carry on

1388
01:45:03.695 --> 01:45:06.755
and his legacy and his honor, not just in work

1389
01:45:06.975 --> 01:45:08.075
but in family as well.

1390
01:45:09.415 --> 01:45:11.515
And the last thing that I feel like is

1391
01:45:11.515 --> 01:45:14.275
so important about this message is his pure joy.

1392
01:45:15.015 --> 01:45:17.195
You guys heard it? He says, yeah.

1393
01:45:19.335 --> 01:45:20.475
And that's just how he was.

1394
01:45:20.495 --> 01:45:25.315
He was be full of pure joy towards the end of his life.

1395
01:45:25.335 --> 01:45:27.595
He didn't have the words to express the joy,

1396
01:45:28.295 --> 01:45:31.235
but as much as you know, as much of, you know, you got

1397
01:45:31.235 --> 01:45:32.915
to sit with him and talk to him in person,

1398
01:45:33.215 --> 01:45:35.475
the joy came in the form of thumbs up.

1399
01:45:36.695 --> 01:45:38.555
So for me, I got the privilege

1400
01:45:38.555 --> 01:45:40.595
of spending a couple hours with him.

1401
01:45:40.975 --> 01:45:43.475
Um, two days prior to his passing with Grammy

1402
01:45:44.375 --> 01:45:45.515
and with Gabby as well.

1403
01:45:46.415 --> 01:45:48.155
The four of us sat in the sun room

1404
01:45:48.155 --> 01:45:51.915
and got to talk about life, all of its highs and lows.

1405
01:45:53.335 --> 01:45:55.155
And when we left I got to hold his hand

1406
01:45:55.175 --> 01:45:56.475
and Gabby got to hold his hand

1407
01:45:56.495 --> 01:45:57.755
and we all said we loved each other.

1408
01:45:58.455 --> 01:46:01.435
But what will be ingrained in my mind forever is looking

1409
01:46:01.465 --> 01:46:04.355
back in that room and him holding thumbs up.

1410
01:46:07.575 --> 01:46:09.915
And I just hope that you all can remember that as well,

1411
01:46:10.065 --> 01:46:13.675
that even in the hardest times in the ya accused times,

1412
01:46:14.095 --> 01:46:15.195
he still had that joy.

1413
01:46:15.815 --> 01:46:18.755
So I give that to you guys today too.

1414
01:46:20.485 --> 01:46:21.995
Thank you. Thank

1415
01:46:21.995 --> 01:46:22.995
You.

1416
01:46:54.355 --> 01:46:57.765
Good morning. Um, thank y'all for coming out.

1417
01:46:58.865 --> 01:47:01.205
I'm Paul Garrett. I'm uh, Gary's stepson.

1418
01:47:02.025 --> 01:47:05.965
Um, you know, him and my mom got married when I was five.

1419
01:47:06.785 --> 01:47:10.565
And from that moment on, he was just dad to me.

1420
01:47:11.505 --> 01:47:16.445
Um, you know, being Gary's redheaded stepchild,

1421
01:47:16.805 --> 01:47:18.605
I came to have, uh, became the master

1422
01:47:18.745 --> 01:47:22.125
of testing his patients that he was so well known for.

1423
01:47:23.305 --> 01:47:25.885
Um, and as I know y can attest

1424
01:47:25.905 --> 01:47:27.285
and a few others in the family,

1425
01:47:27.995 --> 01:47:32.325
when you tested his patients, you got a lecture that was

1426
01:47:33.865 --> 01:47:35.125
an all night event.

1427
01:47:36.265 --> 01:47:39.645
And I remember one of my very few seldom moments

1428
01:47:39.705 --> 01:47:42.685
of being an obstinate teenager, I asked,

1429
01:47:43.585 --> 01:47:45.645
can you just whip my ass and get this over with?

1430
01:47:46.985 --> 01:47:48.565
To which you said no

1431
01:47:49.035 --> 01:47:50.765
because then you wouldn't learn anything.

1432
01:47:52.505 --> 01:47:55.565
And that kind of summed up

1433
01:47:55.565 --> 01:47:57.925
who he was to so many of us.

1434
01:47:58.025 --> 01:48:00.685
He was our teacher and anything

1435
01:48:00.685 --> 01:48:01.965
that we needed to learn about.

1436
01:48:03.025 --> 01:48:07.485
Um, I remember shortly after him and my mom got married, um,

1437
01:48:07.945 --> 01:48:11.205
and we moved in together and I joined Cub Scouts.

1438
01:48:11.465 --> 01:48:14.205
And one of the first things we did was had the little derby

1439
01:48:14.225 --> 01:48:16.325
car competition and race.

1440
01:48:17.305 --> 01:48:20.965
And this is when he taught me how to sand a piece of wood.

1441
01:48:21.465 --> 01:48:23.005
You know, to me it felt like forever,

1442
01:48:23.225 --> 01:48:24.445
but it was probably five minutes

1443
01:48:24.585 --> 01:48:26.125
of just going back and forth.

1444
01:48:26.865 --> 01:48:29.005
And then he comes out and he gets his saw

1445
01:48:29.005 --> 01:48:31.325
and his Dremel tool and carves it all up

1446
01:48:31.985 --> 01:48:36.725
and made me the Batmobile, painted it all up,

1447
01:48:36.945 --> 01:48:38.805
got the Batman logo on there,

1448
01:48:39.785 --> 01:48:42.325
and it came with some little weights

1449
01:48:42.325 --> 01:48:43.645
that you could use to put in there.

1450
01:48:43.645 --> 01:48:44.885
And those were the only weights

1451
01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:45.965
that you were allowed to use.

1452
01:48:47.275 --> 01:48:49.005
Well, he made the front so sleek

1453
01:48:49.005 --> 01:48:51.165
that they weren't really gonna fit how he wanted them.

1454
01:48:52.305 --> 01:48:56.805
So he melted them down to fit into the little crevice

1455
01:48:56.805 --> 01:48:59.165
that he made to make sure that the car went as fast

1456
01:48:59.185 --> 01:49:00.205
as it possibly could.

1457
01:49:01.705 --> 01:49:05.165
So at the competition, of course, I won Best in Show

1458
01:49:05.595 --> 01:49:07.085
because it was the Batmobile.

1459
01:49:08.225 --> 01:49:10.405
And unfortunately we only ended up taking second

1460
01:49:10.405 --> 01:49:11.445
place in the races.

1461
01:49:12.265 --> 01:49:14.645
But I was more happy about Best in Show

1462
01:49:15.005 --> 01:49:16.325
'cause I was in the Batman.

1463
01:49:17.265 --> 01:49:21.485
He created the vehicle from

1464
01:49:21.505 --> 01:49:22.685
my current favorite movie.

1465
01:49:23.385 --> 01:49:26.765
And you know, as, as I look back, you know, one

1466
01:49:26.765 --> 01:49:28.965
of our very first and earliest bonding experiences,

1467
01:49:29.505 --> 01:49:31.165
you know, and something that he just took the time with

1468
01:49:31.165 --> 01:49:33.125
to do with me, you know,

1469
01:49:33.185 --> 01:49:36.485
the make me the special feelings.

1470
01:49:37.265 --> 01:49:40.965
Um, and about 10 years later, he's teaching me

1471
01:49:40.965 --> 01:49:42.125
how to drive a real car.

1472
01:49:43.225 --> 01:49:45.845
And I remember we went out to, uh,

1473
01:49:46.175 --> 01:49:48.085
there was a big church just north

1474
01:49:48.085 --> 01:49:49.605
of Plano when we lived down there

1475
01:49:50.195 --> 01:49:51.605
that had a huge parking lot.

1476
01:49:51.905 --> 01:49:53.805
So we went on a Saturday when it was empty

1477
01:49:54.585 --> 01:49:57.285
and he just made it so simple.

1478
01:49:57.515 --> 01:50:00.445
He's like, all right, pay attention to everything in front

1479
01:50:00.445 --> 01:50:02.925
of you because that's most likely

1480
01:50:02.925 --> 01:50:03.965
where something's gonna happen.

1481
01:50:05.345 --> 01:50:06.845
You have these mirrors to check,

1482
01:50:07.025 --> 01:50:08.565
always know what's going on around you.

1483
01:50:09.505 --> 01:50:12.285
You want to smoothly push on the brake

1484
01:50:12.285 --> 01:50:16.485
and gas so you're not jerking and jumping and let's go.

1485
01:50:18.865 --> 01:50:21.685
And we went out and he taught me how to drive with some

1486
01:50:21.685 --> 01:50:23.445
of the most simple and basic instructions.

1487
01:50:24.545 --> 01:50:28.205
And I just remember he just taught things so well

1488
01:50:28.625 --> 01:50:30.285
and he would simplify them

1489
01:50:31.145 --> 01:50:35.445
and was just there to share in

1490
01:50:36.355 --> 01:50:39.325
your learning and your success and your growing.

1491
01:50:40.625 --> 01:50:44.845
And it was just something he was always there for.

1492
01:50:45.265 --> 01:50:47.525
Um, you know, reading on the back

1493
01:50:47.525 --> 01:50:50.565
of the little handout we got today, you know,

1494
01:50:50.565 --> 01:50:53.005
there towards the bottom it says Pappy was an unwavering

1495
01:50:53.005 --> 01:50:54.405
cheerleader for those he loved.

1496
01:50:54.425 --> 01:50:56.525
And he believed in us more than we believed in ourselves

1497
01:50:56.525 --> 01:50:59.885
most of the time, which is entirely true.

1498
01:51:01.305 --> 01:51:04.085
You know, there's so many times when, you know,

1499
01:51:04.085 --> 01:51:06.965
I thought I was in over my head on something I got myself in

1500
01:51:07.425 --> 01:51:09.885
and he would just be like, well, hey, let's figure it out.

1501
01:51:10.105 --> 01:51:12.845
You're smart, you'll get it.

1502
01:51:15.385 --> 01:51:16.845
And just, you know, to be there

1503
01:51:17.105 --> 01:51:21.885
and to care so deeply for so many of us,

1504
01:51:26.065 --> 01:51:27.245
no matter what through thick

1505
01:51:27.245 --> 01:51:29.125
and thin, you know, I can't tell you

1506
01:51:29.125 --> 01:51:31.965
how many times he picked me up when I fell, you know,

1507
01:51:31.965 --> 01:51:34.325
I'm just thinking, oh, he's gonna be so mad at me.

1508
01:51:34.355 --> 01:51:38.685
He's like, okay, it's done. How do we fix it?

1509
01:51:38.785 --> 01:51:42.125
How do we move forward? And that was it.

1510
01:51:42.125 --> 01:51:44.205
There was never dwelling on negatives.

1511
01:51:44.205 --> 01:51:44.925
There was never

1512
01:51:47.595 --> 01:51:49.325
beating a dead horse.

1513
01:51:50.295 --> 01:51:54.605
There was just learning and growing and being supportive

1514
01:51:56.185 --> 01:51:59.285
and just taking people in

1515
01:52:01.605 --> 01:52:02.805
everyone, you know?

1516
01:52:02.965 --> 01:52:07.765
I mean, One of his favorite things to do was

1517
01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:11.125
host parties and dinners and cook for everyone.

1518
01:52:12.245 --> 01:52:13.325
I remember shortly

1519
01:52:13.325 --> 01:52:17.085
after I got outta high school, you know, he is like, well,

1520
01:52:17.105 --> 01:52:18.365
I'm making a pot of chili.

1521
01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:20.165
Why don't you invite some friends over?

1522
01:52:21.265 --> 01:52:24.725
And then it becomes a thing of, well, hey, let's cook.

1523
01:52:24.725 --> 01:52:25.845
Let's invite some people over.

1524
01:52:26.145 --> 01:52:28.045
It wasn't always just his friends, he wanted

1525
01:52:28.045 --> 01:52:30.765
to host your friends, the people that were special to you

1526
01:52:31.265 --> 01:52:32.485
and just be communal.

1527
01:52:32.585 --> 01:52:33.845
He is. And he always said,

1528
01:52:33.925 --> 01:52:35.925
you can always learn something from everybody.

1529
01:52:37.105 --> 01:52:40.645
And he truly embodied that and exemplified it.

1530
01:52:41.625 --> 01:52:45.165
And I'll forever be grateful you know that he's the man

1531
01:52:45.165 --> 01:52:49.045
who raised me and taught me to be the man that I am today.

1532
01:52:50.745 --> 01:52:54.405
So thank y'all for coming and sharing in his life with us.

1533
01:52:55.115 --> 01:52:57.245
It's nice to see that he meant so much to so many others.

1534
01:53:28.315 --> 01:53:29.605
Gentlemen, you did a good job.

1535
01:53:30.425 --> 01:53:33.285
And Lynette of course, and I held it together.

1536
01:53:33.985 --> 01:53:37.405
But ladies, please don't make me follow you ever again.

1537
01:53:39.235 --> 01:53:43.045
Ever. Most of you know me pretty well.

1538
01:53:43.885 --> 01:53:46.285
I cry like a baby at my own weddings.

1539
01:53:47.225 --> 01:53:50.725
The odds of getting through this are slim. But we'll try.

1540
01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:55.925
In 1978, I was eight years old, we told some

1541
01:53:55.925 --> 01:53:58.845
of these stories earlier and my dad invited me

1542
01:53:58.845 --> 01:54:03.285
to go on a hunting trip to the panhandle, Oklahoma Beaver,

1543
01:54:03.645 --> 01:54:06.445
specifically, we do have a town in Oklahoma named Beaver.

1544
01:54:07.945 --> 01:54:11.005
And I have to tell you, as a young man, actually a kid

1545
01:54:11.585 --> 01:54:15.085
to be invited on a trip to go hunting with the men

1546
01:54:16.185 --> 01:54:17.765
was a great honor, cliff.

1547
01:54:17.765 --> 01:54:22.365
You were there. He took me out into a big

1548
01:54:22.395 --> 01:54:26.205
sunflower field, giant meadow on a beautiful giant ranch

1549
01:54:26.745 --> 01:54:28.605
and set me next to a stock tank

1550
01:54:28.795 --> 01:54:30.285
that had a windmill next to it.

1551
01:54:31.195 --> 01:54:33.565
Gave me a single shot. Four 10, yes.

1552
01:54:33.565 --> 01:54:35.565
At eight years old, I shot a shotgun all the time.

1553
01:54:36.785 --> 01:54:39.165
And he said, you stay here and shoot Dove.

1554
01:54:40.145 --> 01:54:42.405
And I'll be like, right down the road a little bit,

1555
01:54:42.415 --> 01:54:44.285
cross the road, right, right by you.

1556
01:54:44.675 --> 01:54:48.645
I'll be right here. And I sat down next to that windmill

1557
01:54:49.665 --> 01:54:51.965
and that stock tank and I started shooting at Dove.

1558
01:54:51.985 --> 01:54:54.245
And I wasn't a very good shot then either.

1559
01:54:55.305 --> 01:54:56.325
And I missed a lot.

1560
01:54:57.385 --> 01:54:59.805
And every time I missed, I blamed it on the shotgun

1561
01:55:00.115 --> 01:55:02.405
that I just couldn't reach out far enough to hit a dove.

1562
01:55:04.145 --> 01:55:06.365
So I'd take a few steps away from the stock tank

1563
01:55:06.465 --> 01:55:09.965
and the windmill and I'd venture a little further out into

1564
01:55:09.965 --> 01:55:11.285
the sunflower patch.

1565
01:55:12.225 --> 01:55:16.005
And I kept shooting and I kept walking and I kept wandering

1566
01:55:17.185 --> 01:55:19.685
and eventually the bird stopped flying.

1567
01:55:20.705 --> 01:55:22.885
The dove had gone to roost or something.

1568
01:55:24.505 --> 01:55:26.885
And in the absence of the dove, I looked around

1569
01:55:26.945 --> 01:55:28.205
and I discovered that I was

1570
01:55:28.765 --> 01:55:32.725
standing in a head high sunflower patch lost

1571
01:55:33.105 --> 01:55:34.205
as I could possibly be,

1572
01:55:37.025 --> 01:55:41.165
To which I started yelling my dad's name, dad

1573
01:55:42.675 --> 01:55:46.365
screaming actually at one point, even at one point,

1574
01:55:46.365 --> 01:55:49.365
taking shotgun shells and putting them in the four 10

1575
01:55:49.385 --> 01:55:50.845
and shooting them in some fashion

1576
01:55:50.845 --> 01:55:53.925
that I thought might signal an SOS rather than me continuing

1577
01:55:53.925 --> 01:55:55.525
to just shoot for no reason.

1578
01:55:56.585 --> 01:55:58.885
And when I gave up on yelling and screaming

1579
01:55:58.905 --> 01:56:01.565
and shooting, I started crying

1580
01:56:02.985 --> 01:56:07.885
and I put my hands over my face and I bawled

1581
01:56:08.505 --> 01:56:10.245
and eventually fell to my knees

1582
01:56:11.545 --> 01:56:14.205
and sat there in that sea of sunflowers

1583
01:56:15.665 --> 01:56:16.845
and anticipated death.

1584
01:56:16.845 --> 01:56:21.725
At any moment, I'm sure it had been days I was out

1585
01:56:21.725 --> 01:56:23.645
there, or at least minutes.

1586
01:56:25.465 --> 01:56:28.445
And about the time that I felt like I would succumb

1587
01:56:29.425 --> 01:56:33.125
to the elements, I felt a hand on my shoulder.

1588
01:56:35.625 --> 01:56:39.925
And I looked up and there was my dad staring at me

1589
01:56:41.665 --> 01:56:45.925
and I instantly jumped up with joy and gave him a big hug

1590
01:56:46.245 --> 01:56:47.245
'cause he had saved my life.

1591
01:56:49.745 --> 01:56:53.765
But instantly as well, my joy turned to anger

1592
01:56:56.905 --> 01:56:59.365
and I looked him in the eye and I was mad at him.

1593
01:57:00.365 --> 01:57:02.485
I was mad at him because I had yelled

1594
01:57:02.505 --> 01:57:04.325
and screamed trying to find him.

1595
01:57:05.105 --> 01:57:06.565
And he had abandoned me.

1596
01:57:07.985 --> 01:57:10.005
He had left me in the wilderness to die.

1597
01:57:11.995 --> 01:57:13.375
And so I told him such.

1598
01:57:13.755 --> 01:57:15.055
And after I threw my fit

1599
01:57:15.515 --> 01:57:19.935
and berated him like an eight year old can do with

1600
01:57:19.935 --> 01:57:21.815
that same smile that you see

1601
01:57:22.475 --> 01:57:24.175
and the calmness that's been mentioned.

1602
01:57:24.195 --> 01:57:27.295
He just sat there and I went on for a little bit.

1603
01:57:27.295 --> 01:57:28.735
And when I finally got silent

1604
01:57:29.115 --> 01:57:31.735
and I shut my mouth, he said,

1605
01:57:31.955 --> 01:57:34.695
son, I never left you.

1606
01:57:35.925 --> 01:57:40.215
I've been right here the entire time you were screaming

1607
01:57:40.755 --> 01:57:42.935
and yelling and shooting a gun

1608
01:57:43.555 --> 01:57:45.935
and chasing dove and walking away.

1609
01:57:46.895 --> 01:57:51.455
I never left you. He actually said

1610
01:57:52.075 --> 01:57:53.455
to me specifically,

1611
01:57:57.105 --> 01:57:58.665
I will always be here for you.

1612
01:58:00.825 --> 01:58:05.545
I promise you that. What

1613
01:58:05.635 --> 01:58:08.705
reassuring words could an eight year old ever hope

1614
01:58:08.705 --> 01:58:11.545
to hear from his father?

1615
01:58:13.895 --> 01:58:15.985
I'll never, ever in my life forget it.

1616
01:58:17.145 --> 01:58:19.545
I told you this story today 'cause I have a million.

1617
01:58:20.365 --> 01:58:22.225
And that was the only one that I wanted to share.

1618
01:58:24.685 --> 01:58:28.265
In fact, that story would become symbolic

1619
01:58:29.725 --> 01:58:32.025
of times to come in my life

1620
01:58:33.085 --> 01:58:34.905
and in fact in his life.

1621
01:58:37.365 --> 01:58:41.205
See, obviously not all of you knew him as a father,

1622
01:58:42.545 --> 01:58:47.005
but most of you in the room could identify him

1623
01:58:47.145 --> 01:58:48.925
as someone in your life.

1624
01:58:50.185 --> 01:58:54.645
I'm so thankful for the testimonies we've heard today,

1625
01:58:55.185 --> 01:58:58.605
the sharing of some of those incredible identities

1626
01:58:59.595 --> 01:59:02.525
that Gary had a great

1627
01:59:02.845 --> 01:59:06.165
businessman, an entrepreneur.

1628
01:59:06.645 --> 01:59:08.365
I mean, men and women and friends

1629
01:59:08.365 --> 01:59:09.845
and family have stood up here

1630
01:59:09.845 --> 01:59:12.325
and shared how Gary impacted their lives.

1631
01:59:12.385 --> 01:59:14.205
And I've heard nothing but amazing stories

1632
01:59:14.265 --> 01:59:15.365
for the last week and a half.

1633
01:59:16.465 --> 01:59:19.125
And again, we could fill this auditorium with the rest

1634
01:59:19.125 --> 01:59:20.325
of our days telling them,

1635
01:59:20.385 --> 01:59:22.645
but he was so many things to so many people.

1636
01:59:23.855 --> 01:59:28.205
Again, leader, mentor, father, husband,

1637
01:59:29.655 --> 01:59:32.285
uncle, brother Pappy.

1638
01:59:34.145 --> 01:59:37.005
He was a great golfer. We heard that he loved to fish.

1639
01:59:37.145 --> 01:59:40.645
He was a great Turkey hunter, the best of all of us.

1640
01:59:42.505 --> 01:59:44.125
He was a crazy noodler.

1641
01:59:44.505 --> 01:59:46.925
If you don't know what that was, he stuck his hands in holes

1642
01:59:46.985 --> 01:59:50.325
and pulled out catfish for no apparent reason.

1643
01:59:52.865 --> 01:59:56.245
He was our boat captain. You were his first mate.

1644
01:59:58.065 --> 01:59:59.885
He was a minor league baseball player.

1645
01:59:59.985 --> 02:00:01.845
If you didn't know that. He was drafted by the St.

1646
02:00:01.845 --> 02:00:04.405
Louis Cardinals in Gary Fashion.

1647
02:00:04.405 --> 02:00:05.645
They wanted him to play catcher.

1648
02:00:05.645 --> 02:00:08.565
And he said, no, I wanna play second base so I'm not coming.
