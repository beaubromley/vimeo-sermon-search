00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.200
Hi, I'm Lacey Carmichael volunteer coordinator at ministries of

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.500
Jesus. There are over 150 volunteers that

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.900
give more than 16,000 hours annually.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.300
We are excited to get to know you and see

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.400
how God is going to use your gifts and abilities to serve

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.900
our community.

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.400
Intakes are vital part of our ministry Jennifer

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.200
the one who trains our

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.500
intake volunteers, we'll walk you through how to do an

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.400
intake that way. You know what our patients get

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.800
to experience.

12
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.000
I want to take some time today to walk you through

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.500
an intake as well as just help you learn how it's an

14
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.800
educational tool for our patients at MOJ.

15
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.200
We often refer to the intake as the tool that helps

16
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.200
us keep on our mission. And so all of our

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
staff have been through the intake our patients go through

18
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.700
it regularly. So we wanted to give an opportunity for our volunteers

19
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.600
to experience what that intake looks like so

20
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.500
that when you hear us talk about it, you know exactly what we're referring to

21
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.600
so you should have received an intake packet

22
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200
at your volunteer orientation. So go ahead

23
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.000
and get that out and grab something to write with because you're gonna need that too. The

24
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.600
front page is a consent form. It's just

25
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.300
a legal document We're Not Gonna read through that now so you

26
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.300
can just set that one aside. The second page is

27
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.100
the three-part being has three circles on it

28
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.100
and we're gonna spend just a minute here talking about

29
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.500
how we use this page to help people understand what our

30
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.200
mission at ministries of Jesus is. So it

31
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.300
has the three part being the

32
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.000
Soul and Spirit the body is

33
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
what relates to the physical world around us.

34
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.500
It's where we use our five senses and then

35
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.400
we get the soul the mind will and

36
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.300
emotions and that's kind of where we base our decision making

37
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.400
on. How do I feel about something and we act

38
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.500
out of that soul and then God gave us this spirit

39
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.900
and that's the part of us that relates to God and we

40
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.300
try to put other things in there but oftentimes it

41
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.500
never works and we will come up lacking every

42
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.500
time that is for when the Holy

43
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.400
Spirit indwells us when we have that relationship with Jesus Christ.

44
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.600
So God created us as this three-part being a

45
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.000
body. So in a spirit, they're very intricately woven.

46
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.700
You cannot separate one part from the other and

47
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.400
that's by Design. So when somebody comes to ministries

48
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.300
of Jesus and they want physical help through

49
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.400
our Medical Clinic, there's often an

50
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.800
underlying emotional issue. They haven't dealt with and so

51
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.600
we want to be able to treat them em,

52
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.300
Only so we can refer them say to our

53
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.500
counseling area and then of course throughout everything

54
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.700
that we do we offer spiritual guidance and

55
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.100
help and do everything based on scripture. So

56
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.300
that's the three-part being that our Approach

57
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.300
at ministries of Jesus to heal the whole person.

58
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.400
On the questions. I want you to know that it's going

59
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.800
to look a little bit different for you doing this intake

60
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.300
via a video on your own than it

61
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.800
does for our patients that come to ministries of Jesus when

62
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.500
they come here. We are doing them

63
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.400
one-on-one with an intake volunteer. And so

64
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.100
we spend an hour of time walking through these

65
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.700
questions. We read the questions to them because number

66
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.600
one we don't know if they can read and secondly, we

67
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.900
want them to be able to create dialogue

68
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.900
with this. So when we read questions out loud, they think

69
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.200
out loud and then they give us much more

70
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.700
information than just a yes. No answer. So we really

71
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.400
are able to put them at ease and learn more about them. And

72
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.400
then we take those notes and it goes in their medical file. So

73
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.700
a lot different that you're going to experience in

74
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.000
our patients and I just want you to know that going into this but

75
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.000
let's go ahead and look at the questions on page

76
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.200
one. It says physical will at the top

77
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.200
and you'll see that scripture box in the top.

78
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.200
Right that I was mentioning earlier. So you can see kind of

79
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.300
where to read those scriptures and I do again encourage you

80
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.400
to read them as we go so that you can see what God has

81
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.500
to say about these areas of our life. Then Under

82
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.600
The Heading like nutrition those questions, you'll see

83
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.700
one line instruction that says

84
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.000
please check all that are true for you generally speaking

85
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.400
throughout the intake that instruction does not

86
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.400
change, but be aware that

87
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.100
when you get to the relational will and you're doing that one on your

88
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.600
own that those instructions are a little bit different and

89
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.100
so you're going to want to pay attention. Otherwise you'll end up with the wrong

90
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.000
score on your wheels.

91
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.400
then for the questions

92
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.500
On this section. There are five questions. I drink

93
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.100
at least three eight ounce glasses of water a day is the first

94
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.400
one so generally that is not going to be true for anybody

95
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.400
every day. But we want you to answer the questions.

96
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.300
If it's true for you most of the time within the

97
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.900
last two to three months then check the question and then

98
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.300
also be honest if you try to manipulate your

99
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.600
answers so that your wheels turn out really good that defeats

100
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.200
the whole point of the intake. So

101
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.400
be honest with yourself. Nobody else is going to see your answers

102
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.100
anyway, so just write what is true

103
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.400
for you.

104
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.700
Below that on each section. You're going to see kind of a scoring

105
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.100
scale again. Generally this

106
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.400
doesn't change a lot but it does based on

107
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.500
the number of questions in each section. So make

108
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.500
sure you're paying attention and checking the right

109
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.000
score. Otherwise, that will mess up

110
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.000
your wheels as well.

111
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.600
And then you're going to transfer them to your scoring sheet, which

112
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.100
is the wheels page once again, and to do

113
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.300
that. I'm just know that the center of each wheel where there's

114
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.300
a black circle is zero. It's like

115
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.300
the hubcap of the wheel is zero and then each pig out from

116
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.500
that. You count one two, three four, you should

117
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.000
never have an answer on the Outer Circle. We

118
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.300
do that on purpose because that means you're

119
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.400
perfect and nobody gets there until you're in heaven. So

120
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.400
we always leave room for growth. Even if

121
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.200
you end up scoring high in every area.

122
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.200
So you're gonna transfer so say you

123
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.900
got two answers of the physical wheel questions that

124
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.800
said those are true for me then according

125
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.400
to the scoring skill there. You're going

126
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.500
to score it to and you're gonna put that on the second line

127
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.600
above the hubcap on the nutrition wheel,

128
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.300
so you'll score

129
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.300
each one of them that way when you complete a will you're gonna connect your

130
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.400
dots and that's how you will.

131
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.200
Kind of see what your will in that area of your life. Looks like

132
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.800
And then there's one more part under the scoring

133
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.500
mechanism on each section on this

134
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.500
nutrition one. It says I struggle with eating disorders and

135
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.600
then there's more under that.

136
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.000
When we redid this intake several years ago, we wanted

137
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.500
to capture some information but we didn't want

138
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.200
to say oh you have an eating disorder minus one

139
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.400
and duck them for something when maybe that's the

140
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.500
reason they're coming in for help and why they have some physical

141
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.000
issues. So we decided to put those questions separately.

142
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.200
We take the information, but we

143
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.400
don't Factor it into the score. So that's why those

144
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.900
are separate. So each area of questions is

145
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.200
modeled like this. So we're gonna

146
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.200
go ahead and pause the video and go ahead

147
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.200
and do your intake transfer all of your scores to

148
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.200
the wills and draw your Wills then turn the

149
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.100
video back on and we'll wrap this up. Welcome back before we

150
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.300
tie everything together. I want to point out

151
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.400
a few nuances on the intake that maybe you

152
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.800
didn't catch maybe you did but for our patience, these

153
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.700
are ways for us to educate them on the

154
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.300
whole person healing and the other resources that we

155
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.100
have available to them here at MOJ.

156
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.300
So on the physical wheel the nutrition's questions,

157
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.300
there was one that says I am interested in

158
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.500
meeting with a nutritionist we have that available. We put

159
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.300
that in the intake so that they know and that we are

160
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.300
reminded to talk to them about that opportunity if they want

161
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.500
it when you got to the substances questions,

162
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.400
there is one that says I

163
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.200
want to know more about a program that helps people with

164
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.300
Hurts Habits and Hang-Ups. That's when we can tell them

165
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.500
about Celebrate Recovery that meets every Monday night and refer them

166
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.600
to to that for help. There are multiple places

167
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.400
in the intake that we can

168
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.200
point them to social services at ministries of

169
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.500
Jesus, whether it's I don't have means to buy healthy food and

170
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.800
I can't afford to or their struggling with financial

171
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.800
burdens. Those all are reminders

172
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.500
to say. Hey, make sure you talk to Social

173
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.900
Services before you leave on the

174
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.600
relational wheel we offer divorce care

175
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.000
for anyone needing that assistance.

176
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.600
On the emotional wheel we offer grief share

177
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.400
if anybody has suffered a loss that they're struggling to

178
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.400
cope with and we also point to them

179
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.500
that we have free counseling available

180
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.400
for our medical patients. If that

181
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.400
would be helpful for them. Again. They can't afford the medical care.

182
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.100
Therefore. They're not going to be able to afford the counseling and if we

183
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.300
believe in whole person healing then we want to make sure that we

184
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.100
offer that to them for free as well. So those are

185
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.000
some just nuances that I wanted you to be

186
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.300
aware of that helps our patients understand everything that

187
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.300
we have to offer here.

188
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.800
On the spiritual will we do provide Bibles in

189
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.400
their languages? Because we think that's

190
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.500
super important for them to have if we don't have

191
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.700
their language we will order it for them. It's just

192
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.400
so important that we do that sharing the

193
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.000
gospel can come up at any time during the intake and

194
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.600
that can mean a lot of things if it's a returning patient

195
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.200
and we know that they're a Believer. We just

196
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.700
want to pour more scripture into them to encourage them. But if

197
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.200
they're a new patient or we don't know if they have that

198
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.100
relationship with Jesus, we want to make sure we take the

199
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.100
opportunity. So you'll see on the back of your scripture Pages how

200
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.800
to have a relationship with God and

201
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.400
we will literally walk through that page step by

202
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.400
step with them to help them know how they can have

203
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.100
that relationship with Jesus.

204
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.500
You'll see also on the top of the spiritual will we ask

205
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.700
what religion they are? And that's because we serve every

206
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.500
religion that comes through the door at ministries of

207
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.300
Jesus. I've done intakes with the Muslim

208
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.300
before and so if they're devout then they pray

209
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.500
five times a day and their prayer area will come

210
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.200
out looking very strong. But when we see that

211
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.400
there are Muslim then we read that through a different lens. So

212
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.300
we will never Force Christ on

213
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.800
anybody that doesn't want to listen but we always want to ask. Hey, can

214
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.600
I share this with you? So even if

215
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.200
it doesn't happen during the intake, they're gonna

216
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.300
be asked by their nurses and their Physicians. Hey, can

217
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.100
I pray for you and scripture is going to be shared in those appointments as

218
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.700
well. So the gospel is through and through at MOJ,

219
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.400
but the intake is the first chance

220
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.600
we get to share that with our patients. So

221
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.200
back to your wheels that you have drawn ask

222
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.100
yourself if these were the wheels

223
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.800
on my car.

224
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.100
How well would that car be getting down the road?

225
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.200
We asked that question at our intakes every time

226
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.400
and a lot of times. This is where the patient will look at

227
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.100
us and just kind of chuckle or hang their head and shake it

228
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.000
or they'll say I'd be sitting on the side of the road and

229
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.400
and that's true. And again this goes back

230
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.300
to that three-part being diagram the way that

231
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.800
God created us was intricately woven Body Soul

232
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.400
and Spirit and you cannot separate one part from

233
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.600
the other. So if you're physical will comes out

234
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.300
a little flat even if

235
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.500
the other three wheels are good, if that's your car

236
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.500
that one low tire is gonna wear and tear

237
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.200
on the other good ones over time. You've got to keep

238
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.100
them all properly inflated to get down the road with your

239
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.800
car and the same is true for life if the body stolen Spirit

240
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.900
if one part of that is not well, it's gonna

241
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.400
affect how you get down the road of life.

242
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.100
So at MOJ again, it comes back to

243
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.400
we want to help heal the whole person Body Soul

244
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.500
and Spirit. So just

245
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.200
Remember that look at your Wills. How are you doing and

246
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.300
see what areas of your

247
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.500
life you might need to improve on? So on the goals page

248
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.900
that last page of the packet is optional and

249
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.700
we encourage our patients to

250
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.200
set these goals, but they don't have to if they don't want to

251
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.500
but we try to make them attainable goals.

252
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.400
So if they need for instance better exercise,

253
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.700
they don't get any exercise. Then we

254
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.800
help them think through, you know, do I live in a safe neighborhood

255
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.200
I could go walking in or do I

256
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.100
do I like mornings or evenings? What's better for my schedule? Is

257
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.600
there somebody that I can walk with and even

258
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.700
if they have a goal in the spiritual area of

259
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.200
listening to more scripture than we encourage them

260
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.300
while they're walking You Know download the app listen to it

261
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.400
while you walk and so we really try to help

262
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.500
them with attainable goals. So that

263
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.500
is it for the intake. I hope you learned a

264
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.300
lot about yourself. I know I've done the intake on my own before.

265
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.700
And I thought I was a little healthier than I then my

266
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.500
wheels showed me to be so I hope you learned some things

267
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.100
if there's areas that you need to adjust I encourage you

268
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.200
to do that, but we're done. So I'm

269
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.400
gonna toss the video back to Lacey now and she's gonna wrap us

270
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:24.500
up.

271
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.900
As you can see from the first and take appointment patients are

272
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.300
exposed to the gospel and the love of Jesus. This is

273
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.800
why we ask for your testimony in the application process. If

274
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.300
you don't have a personal relationship with Jesus, then it

275
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.600
would be hard to share him with others. We want the message our patients to

276
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.400
receive to be consistent with the gospel in order for us

277
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.200
to reach our mission. We are excited that you're serving with

278
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.600
us and MJ pray for the ministry as you serve and we

279
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.700
look forward to seeing what God's gonna do with you don't hesitate. If

280
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.300
you have any questions. I look forward to seeing you next time

281
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.300
you're in be sure to bring your intake your survey and

282
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.400
your release form. Don't worry. We don't grade the intake. We

283
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.100
have a gift for you and we'll be seeing you soon.
