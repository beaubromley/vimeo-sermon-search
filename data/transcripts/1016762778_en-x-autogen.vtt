1
00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:18.305
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:18.565 --> 00:00:20.505
Uh, my name is John, one of the pastors here.

3
00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:21.945
If you are new to our church

4
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:23.545
or if you've been here a really long time,

5
00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:24.745
we're grateful that you're here.

6
00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:25.945
We love each one of you.

7
00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.425
Uh, we're excited to get to worship together today.

8
00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.745
Let me invite you to take your copy of God's Word

9
00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:33.625
and turn with me to First Samuel chapter 11,

10
00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:36.945
chapter 11 today as we continue this journey.

11
00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:40.465
Just some housekeeping briefly, as you turn there, remember

12
00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:43.705
that next weekend we will be voting, uh, to affirm

13
00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:45.785
or not those three elder candidates we've been putting

14
00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:47.105
before you for the last couple weeks.

15
00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:49.665
So members, you will get an email on Thursday.

16
00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:50.905
You can vote digitally that way,

17
00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:52.785
or you can wait until next Sunday

18
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.385
and we'll have paper ballots available as well.

19
00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:56.985
So just be praying about that.

20
00:00:57.135 --> 00:00:59.265
Looking forward to next weekend for that.

21
00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:02.425
Today though, we're continuing that journey

22
00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:04.985
through the Old Testament book of one Samuel,

23
00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:09.985
a series we're calling He Shall Reign, uh, which

24
00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:11.505
because it, it's, it's titled that

25
00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:16.105
because it describes Israel's search for an earthly king,

26
00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:18.945
which if you remember, as they did,

27
00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.945
that was actually a rejection of their true king,

28
00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:24.625
Yahweh, God almighty.

29
00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:28.305
And what we're learning as we walk through this is

30
00:01:28.305 --> 00:01:30.705
how we can do something very similar in our own hearts.

31
00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:35.805
Even today. Last week Phil showed us out of, uh,

32
00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:38.805
chapters nine and 10, how God appointed Saul

33
00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:41.005
to be Israel's first king

34
00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:43.925
and how God's spirit led that process even

35
00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:47.245
through ordinary means like donkeys, things like that.

36
00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:50.645
Uh, and the narrative Today, what we're beginning to see is

37
00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:52.445
that we're in this transition phase.

38
00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:54.885
I showed this the first week as we kicked this off.

39
00:01:54.985 --> 00:01:58.565
It was Samuel, the, the prophet judge's leadership,

40
00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.005
and now we're transitioning

41
00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:02.525
to Saul's leadership of the nation.

42
00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:04.125
His popularity is rising

43
00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:06.845
and Samuel is kind of fading a little bit.

44
00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:08.965
He'll still be involved, but we'll see it a lot

45
00:02:08.965 --> 00:02:10.165
less as we go forward.

46
00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:14.085
But at this point, Saul is effectively the king,

47
00:02:15.555 --> 00:02:18.455
yet there's still a formal coronation ceremony

48
00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:19.455
that will come at the end

49
00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:20.895
of this chapter into the next chapter.

50
00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:22.455
We'll see that over the next couple weeks.

51
00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:25.455
Uh, but we're also gonna see some really early actions

52
00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:28.895
of this man named Saul, some kingship that he shows.

53
00:02:29.635 --> 00:02:31.775
Uh, and I'm gonna read the whole of chapter 11.

54
00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:33.415
First, it's only 15 verses.

55
00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:35.735
We'll set the context with this, then we'll come back

56
00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:37.055
through it as we go.

57
00:02:37.155 --> 00:02:38.855
So first Samuel chapter 11.

58
00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:44.095
Then Ash or ash, the amite went up

59
00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:46.495
and besieged jab Gilead.

60
00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:50.695
And all the men of jab said to Ash, make a treaty

61
00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:51.735
with us will serve you.

62
00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:56.185
But Ash, the Ammonites said to them, on this condition,

63
00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:57.345
I will make a treaty with you

64
00:02:57.535 --> 00:02:59.525
that I gouge out all your right eyes

65
00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:02.445
and thus bring disgrace on all Israel.

66
00:03:03.565 --> 00:03:05.505
And the elders of Jbe said to him, okay,

67
00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:07.185
well give us seven days respite

68
00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:09.425
that we may send messengers throughout all

69
00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:10.945
the territory of Israel.

70
00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:13.465
Then if there is no one to save us,

71
00:03:13.605 --> 00:03:14.945
we will give ourselves up to you.

72
00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:19.135
When the messengers came to GI Gibbon of Saul,

73
00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:21.535
they reported the matter in all the ears of the people,

74
00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:23.175
and all the people wept aloud.

75
00:03:24.315 --> 00:03:27.655
Now behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen,

76
00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:28.935
and, and Saul said, what's wrong

77
00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:30.335
with the people that they're weeping?

78
00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.295
And so they told him the news of the men of Jesh

79
00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:36.615
and the spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these

80
00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.295
words and his anger was greatly kindled.

81
00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:42.605
He took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces

82
00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:45.165
and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel

83
00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:47.365
by the hand of the messengers, saying,

84
00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:49.285
whoever does not come out after Saul

85
00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:51.805
and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.

86
00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:54.605
And the dread of the Lord fell upon the people,

87
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.285
and they came out as one man.

88
00:03:57.065 --> 00:03:59.085
And when he mustered them at bk, the people

89
00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:02.525
of Israel were 300,000 men of Judah, 30,000.

90
00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:04.685
And they said to the messengers who'd come,

91
00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:07.565
thus shall you say to the men of Jes, Gilead, tomorrow,

92
00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:10.285
by the time the sun is hot, you shall have salvation.

93
00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:14.165
When the meers came and told the men of Jes, they were glad.

94
00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:16.205
Therefore, the men of Jabba said, tomorrow,

95
00:04:16.585 --> 00:04:18.045
we will give ourselves up to you.

96
00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:20.045
They're talking to the Ammonite King tomorrow,

97
00:04:20.045 --> 00:04:21.045
we'll give ourselves up to you.

98
00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:23.365
You may do to us, whatever seems good to you.

99
00:04:24.385 --> 00:04:26.765
And the next day, Saul put the people in three companies

100
00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:29.205
that came to the midst of the camp in the morning, watch

101
00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:32.005
and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day.

102
00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.685
And those who survived were scattered so that no two

103
00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:36.925
of them were left together.

104
00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:41.595
Then the people said to Samuel, who is it that said,

105
00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:43.115
shall Saul reign over us?

106
00:04:43.965 --> 00:04:46.075
Bring them in that we may put them to death.

107
00:04:47.395 --> 00:04:49.295
But Saul said, not a man shall be put

108
00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:50.815
to death this day for today.

109
00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.495
The Lord has worked salvation in Israel.

110
00:04:55.585 --> 00:04:58.275
Then Samuel said to the people, come, let us go to Gilgal

111
00:04:58.275 --> 00:04:59.355
and there renew the kingdom.

112
00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:02.025
So all the people went to gal there.

113
00:05:02.025 --> 00:05:04.825
They made Saul King before the Lord in Gilgal.

114
00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:08.155
And there they sacrificed peace offerings before the Lord.

115
00:05:08.455 --> 00:05:11.955
And there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

116
00:05:12.655 --> 00:05:16.545
So you saw some action, saw some things happen.

117
00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:19.105
And, and here at the beginning of Saul's reign

118
00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:21.825
as Israel's first king, when you look at this,

119
00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:24.185
things appeared pretty promising.

120
00:05:24.245 --> 00:05:27.795
At this point. He just started even not even

121
00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:28.995
fully coordinated yet.

122
00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.915
But here at the beginning of his reign, he, he,

123
00:05:30.915 --> 00:05:32.355
things appeared promising.

124
00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:36.565
Now, you might not know like the map

125
00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:38.085
and the lay the land here.

126
00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:39.925
So again, I'll put the map up here

127
00:05:39.925 --> 00:05:43.125
that the Ammonites were an enemy nation on the east

128
00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:44.205
side of the Jordan River.

129
00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:46.085
That's the right side of the map.

130
00:05:46.105 --> 00:05:47.165
And they were going

131
00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:49.165
after this Israelite town that was up by

132
00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:50.405
what you can see Ray moth there.

133
00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:55.285
And this is what was happening for them to, to ask the rest

134
00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:57.300
of Israel to say, Hey guys, we need some help.

135
00:05:57.585 --> 00:05:58.645
So they sent the messenger.

136
00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:00.325
Saul then leads the people, and

137
00:06:00.325 --> 00:06:02.485
and how he did it was he called the nation

138
00:06:02.665 --> 00:06:04.245
to battle alongside him.

139
00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:05.485
And and you saw that they did.

140
00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:08.765
330,000 people showed up to fight with him.

141
00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:12.765
And so this new king leads Israel against the Ammonites.

142
00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:16.565
And as they went out, they routed these people

143
00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:19.525
who were coming against the nation of Israel.

144
00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:24.525
And notice how you see it in verse 13, what Saul said about

145
00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:25.685
how that victory came about.

146
00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:27.875
Verse 13, today,

147
00:06:28.415 --> 00:06:32.195
the Lord Yahweh has worked salvation in Israel.

148
00:06:33.415 --> 00:06:36.215
So at the beginning here, things looked pretty promising

149
00:06:36.215 --> 00:06:38.335
because right here we see it was God

150
00:06:38.395 --> 00:06:40.455
who brought the victory for this new king.

151
00:06:42.445 --> 00:06:45.455
Saul rallies, the troops goes out to battle. What happens?

152
00:06:45.795 --> 00:06:47.455
God brings the victory.

153
00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:51.115
Now, if you know your Bible, you know

154
00:06:51.115 --> 00:06:55.315
that Saul has a pretty bad reputation based on everything.

155
00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:58.715
We'll see from this point forward, the rest of first Samuel,

156
00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:01.435
the rest of sa like we'll know there's a lot about Saul

157
00:07:01.435 --> 00:07:02.955
that the rest of his life shows us.

158
00:07:02.975 --> 00:07:07.235
But notice here that he actually started pretty

159
00:07:07.235 --> 00:07:08.725
well, right?

160
00:07:08.745 --> 00:07:10.045
He started pretty well

161
00:07:10.145 --> 00:07:12.445
and it was God's blessing that showed up here

162
00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:13.765
for his people.

163
00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:17.045
And so there seemed to be this blessing of God,

164
00:07:19.035 --> 00:07:20.095
not only God's blessing,

165
00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:22.735
but you see actually Saul's humility here.

166
00:07:23.885 --> 00:07:25.145
Notice Saul's humility

167
00:07:25.175 --> 00:07:27.905
that he showed great humility in this sequence,

168
00:07:28.745 --> 00:07:31.395
that he brought a military victory for the people.

169
00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:36.195
But, but watch what God had done and how Saul responded.

170
00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:39.735
If you remember back at the end of chapter 10,

171
00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:42.615
there were actually people who opposed Saul being the king.

172
00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:44.905
Like they didn't want him to be the king.

173
00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:47.945
They didn't want anything to do with Saul.

174
00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:49.545
But, but here what happened, God

175
00:07:50.265 --> 00:07:52.385
publicly proved Saul was the king

176
00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:56.705
brought this military victory to show Saul is in charge.

177
00:07:56.885 --> 00:07:58.905
And then verse 12 says this.

178
00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:03.475
Then the people said to Samuel, who is it that said,

179
00:08:03.765 --> 00:08:04.995
shall Saul reign over us?

180
00:08:05.025 --> 00:08:07.555
Like who was the questioning about this?

181
00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:10.675
Bring them in that we may put them to death.

182
00:08:12.895 --> 00:08:14.425
This might have even been something

183
00:08:14.425 --> 00:08:17.505
that the law allowed those who were traitors, those who were

184
00:08:18.065 --> 00:08:19.265
opposing the king.

185
00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:21.865
But they, they basically came to Samuel

186
00:08:21.885 --> 00:08:23.905
and said, Hey, these people oppose Saul.

187
00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:25.985
Saul's clearly the king. Let's execute them.

188
00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:31.145
But watch again, Saul's response, verse 13.

189
00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:34.585
But Saul said, not a man shall be put

190
00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:36.345
to death this day for today.

191
00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:39.025
The Lord has worked salvation in Israel,

192
00:08:39.975 --> 00:08:43.745
like Saul humbly submitted to the Lord alone.

193
00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:45.705
He knew it was God who brought the victory,

194
00:08:45.845 --> 00:08:47.505
and he knew it was God

195
00:08:47.505 --> 00:08:49.985
who would bring vengeance on his enemies if

196
00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:51.425
God wanted that to happen.

197
00:08:54.315 --> 00:08:57.405
So the beginning of Saul's reign sure appeared promising,

198
00:08:57.405 --> 00:09:00.305
didn't, it seemed to be a lot of good.

199
00:09:00.525 --> 00:09:02.305
It seems like the start of something great

200
00:09:02.335 --> 00:09:04.985
that this could be really effective.

201
00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:07.825
Even at the coronation you saw at the end of the chapter,

202
00:09:08.495 --> 00:09:10.305
Saul was leading people to praise God.

203
00:09:10.575 --> 00:09:14.625
Saul was leading people to worship, not not him, God.

204
00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:20.175
He responded with humility. This seems really effective.

205
00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:22.335
Boy, can't we learn from from this today

206
00:09:23.635 --> 00:09:25.765
when you look at the way Saul responded, I mean,

207
00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:28.165
just consider, I I I came across a couple questions

208
00:09:28.185 --> 00:09:29.205
as I was studying this week,

209
00:09:29.205 --> 00:09:30.525
and I thought they're really effective for me.

210
00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:33.685
And I think they'd be helpful for us to just reflect on

211
00:09:33.685 --> 00:09:36.365
and to think about and to consider as we

212
00:09:36.895 --> 00:09:38.565
think about this whole scene.

213
00:09:38.685 --> 00:09:41.685
I mean, just think about this. When good things happen in

214
00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:45.005
our lives, to whom do we give the credit?

215
00:09:48.065 --> 00:09:50.275
When good things happen and all do, do we give credit

216
00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:51.555
where credit is due?

217
00:09:54.365 --> 00:09:57.135
When others praise you for your work,

218
00:09:58.445 --> 00:10:00.065
do you point them to God's grace?

219
00:10:03.085 --> 00:10:05.695
Like when people praise you for what you've accomplished

220
00:10:05.715 --> 00:10:08.295
or what has happened in your life, do you point them

221
00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:12.335
to God's grace or this,

222
00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:14.695
when others want to make much of you?

223
00:10:15.435 --> 00:10:18.765
Do you make much of God?

224
00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:22.475
'cause that's what was happening here, right?

225
00:10:22.695 --> 00:10:24.155
Saul's this new leader and,

226
00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:26.955
and it's, it's good things happening in his life.

227
00:10:26.955 --> 00:10:28.595
Others are praising him and,

228
00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:30.195
and people are wanting to make much of him.

229
00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:32.395
What was he doing? He was pointing back to God.

230
00:10:34.295 --> 00:10:35.755
Do we do the same?

231
00:10:35.915 --> 00:10:38.075
I mean, do you see how those questions would help keep us

232
00:10:38.895 --> 00:10:41.715
humbly focused on the Lord in our lives?

233
00:10:43.825 --> 00:10:44.955
Just some good questions.

234
00:10:47.925 --> 00:10:50.745
But as great as it seemed to be at the start

235
00:10:50.765 --> 00:10:51.785
of Saul's reign,

236
00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:55.975
there were some immediate concerns at the same time.

237
00:10:58.715 --> 00:11:01.215
In fact, it was even just the history of Saul's family

238
00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:02.335
that sparked concerns.

239
00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:04.095
It sparked these questions.

240
00:11:05.255 --> 00:11:09.745
Even just his family line sparked questions

241
00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:14.865
from the beginning, like

242
00:11:14.865 --> 00:11:16.025
Phil talked about last week.

243
00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:18.945
Do you remember what Israelite tribe Saul is from?

244
00:11:20.975 --> 00:11:22.345
He's from the tribe of Benjamin.

245
00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:25.405
Now, there's nothing wrong with being from the tribe

246
00:11:25.405 --> 00:11:28.315
of Benjamin unless you're gonna be the king,

247
00:11:30.245 --> 00:11:33.055
because all the way back in Genesis 49 when Jacob

248
00:11:33.195 --> 00:11:36.935
and his 12 sons, Jacob was dying, Jacob blessed his 12 sons.

249
00:11:37.475 --> 00:11:39.935
He said it was from the tribe of Judah

250
00:11:40.005 --> 00:11:41.375
that the kings would come from.

251
00:11:44.425 --> 00:11:48.595
So even from the beginning, just the differences

252
00:11:48.615 --> 00:11:53.035
of tribes that he's from Benjamin, not from Judah, just,

253
00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:56.965
just the differences of tribes sparked some questions as

254
00:11:56.965 --> 00:11:59.005
to whether Saul is legit or not.

255
00:11:59.235 --> 00:12:03.085
Like, is this the one that God really wants to be the king?

256
00:12:04.285 --> 00:12:07.905
Is this the the long-term solution that God has?

257
00:12:10.925 --> 00:12:15.065
But not only that, not only the differences of tribes here,

258
00:12:15.645 --> 00:12:20.385
notice the allusions to judges in what Saul did here.

259
00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:24.865
I I see it there.

260
00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:26.465
You see it on the notes that judges is

261
00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:28.065
capitalized and that's on purpose.

262
00:12:28.445 --> 00:12:32.705
I'm referring to the actual book of the Bible called judges.

263
00:12:35.525 --> 00:12:39.985
See some allusions to judges in what Saul does.

264
00:12:40.015 --> 00:12:41.385
Look at verses six

265
00:12:41.405 --> 00:12:43.985
and seven here, when, when Saul heard

266
00:12:44.175 --> 00:12:45.865
what the Ammonites were going to do

267
00:12:45.885 --> 00:12:48.865
and wanted to do to his people, look at what Saul does.

268
00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.945
This is first Samuel 11 verses six and seven.

269
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:55.325
And the spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these

270
00:12:55.335 --> 00:12:57.845
words and his anger was greatly kindled.

271
00:12:58.105 --> 00:13:02.365
He took a yoke, or that's two oxen, cut them in pieces,

272
00:13:03.195 --> 00:13:06.365
sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand

273
00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:08.165
of the messenger saying, whoever does not come out

274
00:13:08.165 --> 00:13:12.245
after Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.

275
00:13:14.255 --> 00:13:16.195
Now, that seems a little weird, doesn't it?

276
00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:20.255
You can just imagine you get a box on your front porch

277
00:13:20.275 --> 00:13:22.095
and you open it up and it's raw cube

278
00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:23.375
steak like, what is this?

279
00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:27.145
What, what is happening? Right?

280
00:13:27.335 --> 00:13:29.865
That was sort of what was going on here.

281
00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:32.835
But what really was going on here?

282
00:13:32.835 --> 00:13:36.595
Well, most commentators believe that this was reminiscent

283
00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:40.315
of the events that happened back in Judges 19,

284
00:13:40.745 --> 00:13:43.115
that precipitated the Benjaminite war.

285
00:13:44.465 --> 00:13:45.645
I'm not gonna go into full detail.

286
00:13:45.645 --> 00:13:47.365
We, we walked through judges a couple years ago.

287
00:13:47.595 --> 00:13:50.085
This was a really hard one as we looked at this, but,

288
00:13:50.345 --> 00:13:53.005
but what happened was all the other tribes

289
00:13:53.225 --> 00:13:57.085
of Israel mustard against the Benjamin Knights

290
00:13:57.085 --> 00:14:00.645
because of their horrific sin against a young woman.

291
00:14:03.595 --> 00:14:07.925
And basically the rest of the Israel just wiped out more

292
00:14:07.925 --> 00:14:12.145
or less the tribe of Benjamin, which by the way, led

293
00:14:12.145 --> 00:14:16.145
to the intermarriage between Gibber and Jesh.

294
00:14:16.205 --> 00:14:17.385
Gilead, which is the town

295
00:14:17.385 --> 00:14:20.025
that's in in threatened here in one Samuel.

296
00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:22.185
So there's even this link together.

297
00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:27.595
But, but think of the other parallels here,

298
00:14:27.595 --> 00:14:31.515
because they, they were the Benjamin Knights.

299
00:14:32.485 --> 00:14:35.795
What tribe was saw from, he's from Benjamin.

300
00:14:38.065 --> 00:14:40.535
There was also, again, back in judges 19,

301
00:14:40.925 --> 00:14:42.495
something was cut up

302
00:14:42.795 --> 00:14:46.655
and sent throughout the nation as a call to war.

303
00:14:48.605 --> 00:14:50.815
This is the same thing happening here.

304
00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:53.845
Saul cuts up something, sends it throughout the nation

305
00:14:53.905 --> 00:14:55.125
as a call to action.

306
00:14:57.005 --> 00:14:59.185
But also think about this, judges was right

307
00:14:59.285 --> 00:15:04.095
before the events in one Samuel, at the end

308
00:15:04.115 --> 00:15:09.005
of judges, four times in the last five chapters

309
00:15:09.005 --> 00:15:13.715
of judges, it says this, in those days,

310
00:15:14.245 --> 00:15:16.675
there was no king in Israel.

311
00:15:17.595 --> 00:15:20.075
Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.

312
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:23.775
That's not a good thing.

313
00:15:25.535 --> 00:15:26.825
Four times it says that

314
00:15:27.325 --> 00:15:29.615
because there was no king in Israel, everyone did

315
00:15:29.615 --> 00:15:30.775
what was right in his own eyes.

316
00:15:30.795 --> 00:15:34.215
Now, the difference here in First Samuel, when Saul does

317
00:15:34.215 --> 00:15:36.975
what he does is that it says explicitly the spirit

318
00:15:36.975 --> 00:15:40.575
of God came on him in leading him to cut up the ox

319
00:15:40.635 --> 00:15:41.775
and send it out.

320
00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:43.855
So that wasn't happening in judges,

321
00:15:43.965 --> 00:15:45.615
they just did it on their own.

322
00:15:46.035 --> 00:15:49.015
So there was a measure of God confirming Saul

323
00:15:49.885 --> 00:15:51.175
that the success

324
00:15:51.175 --> 00:15:53.095
of the military battle was saying Saul

325
00:15:53.115 --> 00:15:54.255
is the leader right now.

326
00:15:54.595 --> 00:15:59.445
That's part of it. But we also can't forget that.

327
00:15:59.765 --> 00:16:04.185
Remember in one Samuel, they had rejected God

328
00:16:04.405 --> 00:16:07.385
as their king in the search for an earthly king.

329
00:16:10.265 --> 00:16:12.845
Not only that in what Saul was doing,

330
00:16:12.945 --> 00:16:15.325
he was acting like one of the judges.

331
00:16:16.965 --> 00:16:19.535
Like he led this whole military campaign,

332
00:16:19.805 --> 00:16:22.655
just like all the judges did in the Old Testament,

333
00:16:22.655 --> 00:16:25.655
in judges, much,

334
00:16:25.675 --> 00:16:29.455
the same language is used in judges about the way those

335
00:16:29.545 --> 00:16:31.615
would would lead and defend.

336
00:16:31.755 --> 00:16:33.975
It was all like the spirit of God rushed upon them,

337
00:16:34.155 --> 00:16:35.655
the spirit of God rushed upon them,

338
00:16:35.675 --> 00:16:38.135
and they defeated the enemy and saved the people.

339
00:16:38.325 --> 00:16:41.325
What happened with Saul? He's acting like a judge.

340
00:16:43.215 --> 00:16:47.065
You put all this together, all these ties back

341
00:16:47.165 --> 00:16:48.625
to the book of judges.

342
00:16:50.305 --> 00:16:51.725
It slants this whole thing.

343
00:16:51.745 --> 00:16:53.285
Saul's doing very negatively

344
00:16:55.705 --> 00:16:57.435
because you remember what it said in judges.

345
00:16:57.525 --> 00:16:59.995
There was no king in Israel. What did they do?

346
00:16:59.995 --> 00:17:02.075
In one Samuel, they rejected God

347
00:17:02.135 --> 00:17:03.915
as their king in search for some other king.

348
00:17:04.005 --> 00:17:07.155
There was no king led to people doing what they wanted here.

349
00:17:08.075 --> 00:17:12.385
Functionally, they were acting like there was no king,

350
00:17:12.905 --> 00:17:15.115
that they were not under the authority of the king.

351
00:17:17.655 --> 00:17:20.155
So here's what the what you wrap all this together,

352
00:17:20.255 --> 00:17:22.515
it shows the problem created

353
00:17:22.935 --> 00:17:25.675
as the people initiated the monarchy here.

354
00:17:27.215 --> 00:17:29.545
They said, we reject God. We want our own king.

355
00:17:29.895 --> 00:17:32.065
They were the ones. Now, God said it was coming,

356
00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:34.665
but it was their initiative instead of God's initiative.

357
00:17:36.065 --> 00:17:37.845
He had the best plans in store.

358
00:17:37.955 --> 00:17:39.925
They went after it this way and that way,

359
00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:41.285
and they looked for the tallest dude.

360
00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:44.975
They got Saul who's not even matching up all the stuff

361
00:17:44.975 --> 00:17:46.135
that needed to be matched

362
00:17:46.235 --> 00:17:50.175
to be the king like, like that.

363
00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:51.615
It's just just instructive for us.

364
00:17:51.685 --> 00:17:53.375
When we start getting ahead of God,

365
00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:56.455
when we start walking our own way with God, what happens?

366
00:17:56.875 --> 00:18:01.005
We get in trouble. It's the same way we see it

367
00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:02.405
happening here.

368
00:18:02.745 --> 00:18:07.005
So it seemed like early on for Saul in this kingship,

369
00:18:07.005 --> 00:18:10.805
it seemed like things were a promising future.

370
00:18:12.635 --> 00:18:14.415
And notice God worked through it.

371
00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:17.455
He still proved he could work through fallen humans

372
00:18:17.595 --> 00:18:20.375
and through a king who submitted to him.

373
00:18:20.595 --> 00:18:22.935
Yes, but there were still all these questions, right?

374
00:18:24.515 --> 00:18:25.735
Too many similarities to judges,

375
00:18:25.915 --> 00:18:27.135
too many things that didn't match.

376
00:18:27.185 --> 00:18:29.655
There were still these questions,

377
00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:32.575
and so what we're coming to at this point, at the end

378
00:18:32.575 --> 00:18:35.055
of chapter 11 is we're still not sure how this is gonna go.

379
00:18:37.355 --> 00:18:40.245
Like we think, okay, God has worked. God set this up.

380
00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:41.765
Maybe it seems like it could be good.

381
00:18:41.765 --> 00:18:44.525
We're not really, we're still not sure how Saul's gonna be.

382
00:18:45.675 --> 00:18:47.105
Seems like he's submitted to the Lord,

383
00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:50.525
but we don't actually know till we get into the next

384
00:18:50.865 --> 00:18:52.245
few chapters.

385
00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:55.705
Will this king, will he remain

386
00:18:55.775 --> 00:18:57.865
submitted to God's word?

387
00:18:58.295 --> 00:18:59.545
Will he remain submitted

388
00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:02.025
to God's prophets like he was supposed to?

389
00:19:04.235 --> 00:19:06.865
We'll find out as we go into the next few weeks.

390
00:19:09.755 --> 00:19:10.935
But ultimately though, and

391
00:19:10.935 --> 00:19:13.815
and this is in the end, this is

392
00:19:13.895 --> 00:19:15.975
what we've already seen in first Samuel A. Little bit.

393
00:19:15.975 --> 00:19:18.655
But here's, this starts to show us very clearly

394
00:19:18.715 --> 00:19:21.145
and very quickly that the story

395
00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:23.705
of Saul's kingship points us forward.

396
00:19:25.775 --> 00:19:27.835
We look at it, we study it, we analyze it,

397
00:19:27.855 --> 00:19:30.155
but ultimately put, it points us forward.

398
00:19:34.015 --> 00:19:37.225
Saul being the king is meant to point us to something else.

399
00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:41.585
Because again, remember how much was wrong with Saul

400
00:19:41.645 --> 00:19:42.665
and his kingship?

401
00:19:43.865 --> 00:19:45.085
How many things were not right?

402
00:19:45.145 --> 00:19:48.525
He wasn't right for the tribe. He acted more like a judge.

403
00:19:48.745 --> 00:19:50.445
It was the people's request to begin with.

404
00:19:50.445 --> 00:19:52.885
It wasn't God's initiative, it was all of that.

405
00:19:52.885 --> 00:19:55.685
It was all primarily to remind us

406
00:19:56.035 --> 00:19:58.165
that there's really only one king

407
00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:02.295
and that king is God almighty.

408
00:20:04.425 --> 00:20:06.555
There's only one king that we truly need.

409
00:20:06.555 --> 00:20:08.675
There's only one king over all the others.

410
00:20:08.865 --> 00:20:10.035
This is what Saul,

411
00:20:10.035 --> 00:20:12.275
as the king is really intended to show us.

412
00:20:13.765 --> 00:20:17.175
It's not about the king here. It's about the one true king.

413
00:20:17.335 --> 00:20:19.495
I love how Psalm 95 puts.

414
00:20:19.495 --> 00:20:23.375
It says, oh, come let us sing to the Lord.

415
00:20:23.835 --> 00:20:26.775
Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.

416
00:20:27.195 --> 00:20:29.495
Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving.

417
00:20:29.835 --> 00:20:32.455
Let us make a joyful noise to him with songs

418
00:20:32.475 --> 00:20:34.015
of praise for the Lord.

419
00:20:34.235 --> 00:20:35.895
Yahweh is a great God

420
00:20:36.315 --> 00:20:39.975
and a great king above all Gods.

421
00:20:42.725 --> 00:20:45.865
He is worthy. What that says, he's worthy of all over praise

422
00:20:45.895 --> 00:20:47.645
because he's over all things.

423
00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:50.985
There's one true king.

424
00:20:51.005 --> 00:20:52.305
But do you remember again

425
00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:55.705
how Israel responded to that truth?

426
00:20:59.945 --> 00:21:02.935
Again, it's what we can do just as easily.

427
00:21:03.455 --> 00:21:08.225
Remember, the Lord says to Samuel,

428
00:21:08.455 --> 00:21:10.105
obey the voice of the people and all they say to you,

429
00:21:10.105 --> 00:21:11.305
they've not rejected you.

430
00:21:11.815 --> 00:21:14.905
They have rejected me from being king over them.

431
00:21:17.815 --> 00:21:21.075
That's how we got in this mess with Saul,

432
00:21:21.305 --> 00:21:23.355
with all the ammonite tribe, all the stuff

433
00:21:25.525 --> 00:21:26.655
they've rejected me.

434
00:21:26.795 --> 00:21:30.975
God says, from being king over them, remember that's that.

435
00:21:30.975 --> 00:21:32.815
That word means they spit in his face.

436
00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:34.695
They handled him with contempt.

437
00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:37.535
They said, God, you're not our king at all.

438
00:21:37.915 --> 00:21:39.655
God was their king.

439
00:21:39.955 --> 00:21:43.015
He was the one to protect them, preserve them,

440
00:21:43.045 --> 00:21:44.655
prosper them, fulfill them.

441
00:21:44.885 --> 00:21:46.895
They just started looking everywhere else for it.

442
00:21:50.805 --> 00:21:51.985
Man, we do the same thing.

443
00:21:57.125 --> 00:22:00.535
Some people look outside of God's boundaries

444
00:22:00.715 --> 00:22:02.175
for sexual fulfillment.

445
00:22:06.135 --> 00:22:11.025
Some people look to false religions for inner peace.

446
00:22:14.335 --> 00:22:18.585
Some people look to radical weight loss schemes in order

447
00:22:18.605 --> 00:22:19.945
to be socially acceptable.

448
00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:25.305
Some people look to guns

449
00:22:25.305 --> 00:22:27.745
and ammunition as the protection that they

450
00:22:28.265 --> 00:22:31.325
absolutely must have to feel safe.

451
00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:36.495
Now, those

452
00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:42.185
and so much more can be the kings

453
00:22:42.615 --> 00:22:45.665
that we look to in our lives for protection

454
00:22:45.845 --> 00:22:47.465
and provision and fulfillment.

455
00:22:51.805 --> 00:22:53.905
The problem is if we allow those things

456
00:22:54.365 --> 00:22:57.265
to call the shots in our lives, that's

457
00:22:57.265 --> 00:23:02.225
what the Bible calls an idol, that it sits on the throne.

458
00:23:03.485 --> 00:23:05.145
It is our king.

459
00:23:06.175 --> 00:23:08.795
If it's, if it's what we put our trust in,

460
00:23:08.975 --> 00:23:10.875
it is an idol in our lives.

461
00:23:15.015 --> 00:23:17.765
Again, we can't knock God off of his throne.

462
00:23:20.575 --> 00:23:23.195
He is the rightful king over all things.

463
00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:27.635
But we can act as if we are the king of our own lives

464
00:23:27.895 --> 00:23:31.995
or as if this or that will give us what we're looking for.

465
00:23:32.335 --> 00:23:35.235
And in so doing, we do exactly what one Samuel eight,

466
00:23:35.235 --> 00:23:38.475
seven says, they have rejected me from being king over them.

467
00:23:40.145 --> 00:23:43.685
We do the exact same thing. We forsake God.

468
00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:45.085
There's only one king,

469
00:23:45.505 --> 00:23:49.405
and we must keep him at the throne of our own hearts.

470
00:23:54.495 --> 00:23:58.075
But the story of Saul's kingship not only points us forward

471
00:23:58.135 --> 00:23:59.875
to the fact that there's one true king,

472
00:24:00.255 --> 00:24:01.915
it also points us forward another way

473
00:24:01.915 --> 00:24:04.875
that there's only one savior as well, that

474
00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:09.145
there's only one savior.

475
00:24:12.665 --> 00:24:14.665
'cause really, when you look at one Samuel 11,

476
00:24:16.375 --> 00:24:18.425
it's a salvation narrative, isn't it?

477
00:24:19.895 --> 00:24:24.545
This whole chapter, you look at it, the town is in trouble,

478
00:24:26.335 --> 00:24:28.595
and so verse three, they look for someone,

479
00:24:28.615 --> 00:24:29.835
it says to save them.

480
00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:33.985
Then verse nine, what does Saul talk about?

481
00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:38.385
He talks about this, this word of salvation that he sends

482
00:24:38.405 --> 00:24:42.245
to the people even himself.

483
00:24:42.245 --> 00:24:43.645
In verse 13, what does he say?

484
00:24:43.865 --> 00:24:47.605
The Lord has worked salvation in Israel today.

485
00:24:51.205 --> 00:24:53.785
So we've seen this already throughout the book.

486
00:24:54.985 --> 00:24:56.565
You can trace back all the way to Genesis,

487
00:24:56.705 --> 00:24:59.165
but it's all the way throughout one Samuel as well,

488
00:24:59.515 --> 00:25:02.565
that the Lord himself can handle delivering his people.

489
00:25:04.715 --> 00:25:07.925
He doesn't need us like his system works.

490
00:25:09.695 --> 00:25:12.195
He can deliver. He will deliver.

491
00:25:12.895 --> 00:25:15.035
No earthly king is actually needed here.

492
00:25:15.555 --> 00:25:17.295
You remember how that worked a couple chapters ago?

493
00:25:17.635 --> 00:25:20.775
God just won it without anybody. God won it without anybody.

494
00:25:20.915 --> 00:25:22.015
God won it without anybody.

495
00:25:22.115 --> 00:25:23.615
He does it even here a little bit, right?

496
00:25:23.615 --> 00:25:27.055
There's nothing else is needed. We just need him.

497
00:25:29.005 --> 00:25:32.225
Now, God may choose to work through his servants as he does

498
00:25:32.455 --> 00:25:36.145
with Saul, but only God alone offers salvation

499
00:25:36.685 --> 00:25:37.865
for his people.

500
00:25:39.805 --> 00:25:41.495
Like just here. Just look at this example.

501
00:25:41.995 --> 00:25:45.135
God provided the leader, God empowered the leader,

502
00:25:45.355 --> 00:25:47.375
and God defeated the enemy.

503
00:25:49.185 --> 00:25:53.505
It's very clear God brings the victory.

504
00:25:54.705 --> 00:25:57.385
He is the savior. See, that

505
00:25:59.655 --> 00:26:02.225
Could, There actually may be another

506
00:26:02.225 --> 00:26:03.425
layer to this cake.

507
00:26:05.175 --> 00:26:06.485
Could have put an onion up there, right?

508
00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:08.045
But I picked cake cake's better.

509
00:26:11.395 --> 00:26:14.555
See there, there's a deeper layer here

510
00:26:14.625 --> 00:26:18.475
that actually takes our minds to a greater victory,

511
00:26:18.615 --> 00:26:20.395
to the greatest victory,

512
00:26:22.335 --> 00:26:24.235
and it's something we would easily miss

513
00:26:24.265 --> 00:26:25.675
because we speak English,

514
00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:33.765
And it has to do with the name of the ammonite king here,

515
00:26:33.895 --> 00:26:35.325
who's coming against God's People.

516
00:26:37.695 --> 00:26:39.555
See, when you read through the Bible in the Old Testament,

517
00:26:39.555 --> 00:26:41.035
you see all these military victories

518
00:26:41.035 --> 00:26:42.715
and battles of people coming against God's people.

519
00:26:43.225 --> 00:26:45.245
The Bible doesn't always, in fact,

520
00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:47.245
doesn't often record the name

521
00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:50.285
of the enemy king who's coming against God's people.

522
00:26:51.615 --> 00:26:52.955
It might just say King of Moab

523
00:26:52.955 --> 00:26:54.195
or king of Amina, like whatever.

524
00:26:54.335 --> 00:26:57.715
It doesn't often here. It repeats it a number of times.

525
00:26:58.015 --> 00:27:02.475
Did you see it? I believe

526
00:27:02.475 --> 00:27:04.635
that was intentional because what does verse one say

527
00:27:04.745 --> 00:27:07.275
that the Ammonite king's name was?

528
00:27:08.605 --> 00:27:12.305
It says, Ash is the way you would say that in Hebrew,

529
00:27:13.045 --> 00:27:16.775
and that word in Hebrew, by the way, means snake.

530
00:27:19.795 --> 00:27:21.085
Okay? Where am I going with this?

531
00:27:22.675 --> 00:27:26.975
So when an ancient Israelite would read one Samuel 11,

532
00:27:27.805 --> 00:27:31.775
what they would read is that the snake went up

533
00:27:31.995 --> 00:27:34.215
to besiege, jesh, Gilead,

534
00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:39.595
and where their minds would go most likely is

535
00:27:39.595 --> 00:27:42.675
to Genesis chapter three, where in verse one

536
00:27:42.675 --> 00:27:44.875
of Genesis three, it says, Ash,

537
00:27:45.655 --> 00:27:49.315
the serpent was more crafty than all the other beasts

538
00:27:49.315 --> 00:27:50.915
of the field that the Lord God had made.

539
00:27:53.545 --> 00:27:57.365
And so what you had back in Genesis three was an adversary

540
00:27:57.635 --> 00:27:59.245
attacking Adam and Eve,

541
00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:02.525
and as they were defeated, they were disgraced

542
00:28:02.545 --> 00:28:04.365
and became his slaves.

543
00:28:05.305 --> 00:28:07.485
Yet what did God do? He intervened

544
00:28:07.785 --> 00:28:12.765
and declared war on Ash saying this in Genesis three 15

545
00:28:12.975 --> 00:28:14.525
where he promises a savior.

546
00:28:14.525 --> 00:28:15.565
Listen to what it says.

547
00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:19.345
I will put enmity between you, Ash

548
00:28:19.445 --> 00:28:22.505
and the woman between your offspring and her offspring.

549
00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:27.745
He shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel.

550
00:28:32.085 --> 00:28:36.775
What happened in one Samuel 11 Nahash?

551
00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:40.295
The ammonite tried verse two,

552
00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:43.255
to bring disgrace on all Israel

553
00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:46.135
by attacking God's people and what did he want to do?

554
00:28:46.695 --> 00:28:50.725
Enslaved them. Yet what did God do?

555
00:28:52.205 --> 00:28:53.225
He intervened

556
00:28:53.525 --> 00:28:57.545
and declared war on nahash by anointing Saul

557
00:28:57.845 --> 00:29:01.905
to be a savior, to crush the head of that snake.

558
00:29:05.495 --> 00:29:06.675
Do you see what's happening here?

559
00:29:09.255 --> 00:29:13.995
God allowed the ammonite threat to come against Israel so

560
00:29:13.995 --> 00:29:17.595
that he could confirm Saul as his king,

561
00:29:17.975 --> 00:29:20.155
as Saul defeated the snake

562
00:29:20.385 --> 00:29:22.235
that his people needed him to defeat.

563
00:29:25.535 --> 00:29:26.955
See how this is all working out?

564
00:29:29.265 --> 00:29:30.965
Sounds familiar now, doesn't it?

565
00:29:33.615 --> 00:29:36.105
Because where do our minds go when we hear the word snake?

566
00:29:38.785 --> 00:29:43.445
Our minds go to the enemy of our souls, Satan,

567
00:29:44.055 --> 00:29:48.485
whose desire is to disgrace and enslave people,

568
00:29:52.425 --> 00:29:56.725
but that war is not just a war for a town or for land.

569
00:29:56.915 --> 00:30:00.645
That war is against our souls to destroy us

570
00:30:04.225 --> 00:30:06.485
and praise God that he intervened

571
00:30:06.585 --> 00:30:08.165
and sent a savior,

572
00:30:11.285 --> 00:30:13.785
the only savior, right?

573
00:30:13.785 --> 00:30:16.385
We're talking about this, the only savior king Jesus.

574
00:30:16.485 --> 00:30:17.545
Now, watch how he does it.

575
00:30:18.485 --> 00:30:22.315
Watch how he did this, that yes, Genesis three says

576
00:30:22.315 --> 00:30:27.195
that snake would inflict a wound on him through the cross.

577
00:30:27.645 --> 00:30:30.755
Jesus would ultimately crush Satan's head.

578
00:30:31.495 --> 00:30:33.315
The power of sin would be defeated

579
00:30:33.345 --> 00:30:36.755
through Jesus's death on the cross and the power of death,

580
00:30:36.775 --> 00:30:38.235
and Satan would be defeated

581
00:30:38.235 --> 00:30:39.755
through his victorious resurrection.

582
00:30:40.095 --> 00:30:41.115
Out of that grave,

583
00:30:42.835 --> 00:30:45.205
there's only one savior church, right?

584
00:30:45.225 --> 00:30:47.565
That's how the same kind of process

585
00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:50.765
of redemptive history we read in Genesis one, Samuel,

586
00:30:51.065 --> 00:30:54.555
we see it in Jesus, the ultimate only

587
00:30:55.215 --> 00:30:57.195
Savior, okay?

588
00:30:57.415 --> 00:31:00.155
And the fact that there is only one savior church means

589
00:31:00.385 --> 00:31:01.875
something very clear for us.

590
00:31:04.775 --> 00:31:07.405
Let's stop looking for functional saviors then.

591
00:31:10.675 --> 00:31:14.465
If there's only one, then let's stop looking

592
00:31:14.485 --> 00:31:15.745
for functional saviors.

593
00:31:18.735 --> 00:31:23.035
We saw how we look for replacement kings to protect us,

594
00:31:23.535 --> 00:31:27.355
to provide for us the same way we look for functional

595
00:31:28.065 --> 00:31:31.155
saviors, to deliver us from the mess

596
00:31:31.425 --> 00:31:32.835
that we are in in our lives.

597
00:31:36.565 --> 00:31:40.065
We look for politicians to fix our nation.

598
00:31:43.205 --> 00:31:46.305
We look for a relationship to complete us.

599
00:31:50.015 --> 00:31:52.795
We look for money to finally get us

600
00:31:52.795 --> 00:31:53.955
where we think we should be.

601
00:31:57.965 --> 00:32:01.465
We look for entertainment to help us escape from reality.

602
00:32:06.275 --> 00:32:08.825
Those are all ways that we try to,

603
00:32:09.045 --> 00:32:11.145
to be saved from something

604
00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:15.435
and hear me, even religion

605
00:32:15.895 --> 00:32:18.435
and church can be functional saviors,

606
00:32:21.705 --> 00:32:26.155
because what actually saves you is not the rituals

607
00:32:26.275 --> 00:32:28.995
and behaviors associated with Christianity.

608
00:32:30.745 --> 00:32:33.275
It's not you being a better person than your coworker

609
00:32:33.415 --> 00:32:34.755
or your classmate.

610
00:32:35.025 --> 00:32:37.315
It's not the fact that you grew up in church

611
00:32:37.495 --> 00:32:40.285
or that you know a lot of answers in your small group.

612
00:32:40.665 --> 00:32:43.405
The only way you are saved is through

613
00:32:43.405 --> 00:32:45.245
what Jesus has done for you.

614
00:32:47.575 --> 00:32:49.145
It's not about the rich.

615
00:32:49.215 --> 00:32:52.305
It's not about just being calling yourself a Christian.

616
00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:57.515
It's Jesus' work in your place that actually saves you.

617
00:32:59.725 --> 00:33:03.175
It's you turning from your sin and yourself

618
00:33:03.395 --> 00:33:05.535
and saying, Jesus, I trust you

619
00:33:05.675 --> 00:33:07.815
and your work that you did for me.

620
00:33:07.935 --> 00:33:11.895
I trust you in it. I place my faith in your life, death

621
00:33:11.895 --> 00:33:13.695
and resurrection that all of you,

622
00:33:13.765 --> 00:33:15.695
what you've done counts for me.

623
00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:18.495
It counts in my place. You are my savior.

624
00:33:20.615 --> 00:33:21.865
There's only one savior.

625
00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:26.305
So stop looking for functional saviors

626
00:33:28.465 --> 00:33:31.245
And listen, if you've never responded to Jesus like

627
00:33:31.245 --> 00:33:36.155
that, why not today?

628
00:33:38.185 --> 00:33:40.005
If you've been trusting in any

629
00:33:40.005 --> 00:33:41.685
of those other things, why not today?

630
00:33:44.285 --> 00:33:47.125
Say, Jesus, I've been trying

631
00:33:47.185 --> 00:33:48.525
so long, I've been trying too hard.

632
00:33:48.555 --> 00:33:51.245
I've been exhausting myself to try

633
00:33:51.245 --> 00:33:53.885
to act like a Christian when I've never actually

634
00:33:54.195 --> 00:33:55.685
trusted you for salvation.

635
00:33:55.905 --> 00:34:00.665
Why not today? But listen, if you have,

636
00:34:02.205 --> 00:34:03.835
if you have trusted

637
00:34:04.255 --> 00:34:06.675
and placed your faith in Jesus already,

638
00:34:07.055 --> 00:34:09.555
should this not draw us nearer,

639
00:34:11.695 --> 00:34:14.875
should this not cause us to examine our hearts

640
00:34:15.095 --> 00:34:18.555
and look deeply within us to search our hearts?

641
00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:23.465
Say, Jesus, what more do you want from me?

642
00:34:23.615 --> 00:34:27.665
What more of me do you want as my king, as my savior?

643
00:34:30.005 --> 00:34:33.065
And should this not spark worship

644
00:34:33.605 --> 00:34:36.625
and obedience as we consider this king

645
00:34:36.765 --> 00:34:38.465
and savior, that's our our Lord?

646
00:34:40.895 --> 00:34:45.345
Like Psalm 95 said, the Lord is worthy

647
00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:49.865
of our praise because he's the great king over all

648
00:34:49.995 --> 00:34:51.025
other gods.

649
00:34:54.285 --> 00:34:55.345
He is the humble savior.

650
00:34:55.485 --> 00:34:57.545
So let's respond to him in that church,

651
00:35:00.445 --> 00:35:04.705
in faith, in hope and obedience and in trust.

652
00:35:06.715 --> 00:35:09.885
He's all I need. Bow your heads with me.

653
00:35:09.935 --> 00:35:12.605
Let's take this to the Lord together, if you would.

654
00:35:13.835 --> 00:35:18.165
Lord, I pray right now for every person, as we do,

655
00:35:18.425 --> 00:35:20.765
let this word sit on our hearts, that you would

656
00:35:21.545 --> 00:35:23.525
dig deeply into us right now,

657
00:35:24.825 --> 00:35:27.365
and we'd give you some space right now in our hearts,

658
00:35:27.795 --> 00:35:29.485
whether we do that regularly

659
00:35:29.485 --> 00:35:30.845
or not, God, this is an opportunity.

660
00:35:30.865 --> 00:35:33.365
So I pray as we just sit here quietly for a moment,

661
00:35:36.305 --> 00:35:39.645
you would reveal to us where we have placed other kings,

662
00:35:39.645 --> 00:35:44.405
other saviors in our lives, trusted those instead

663
00:35:44.405 --> 00:35:47.165
of you and lead us back.

664
00:35:47.315 --> 00:35:48.645
Draw us back to you. God,

665
00:36:21.435 --> 00:36:25.885
just ask yourself those questions that I asked earlier about

666
00:36:26.815 --> 00:36:29.765
where you point others,

667
00:36:30.475 --> 00:36:32.085
when good things happen in your life,

668
00:36:32.385 --> 00:36:33.485
who do you give the credit to

669
00:36:37.635 --> 00:36:39.005
when others wanna make much of you?

670
00:36:39.065 --> 00:36:40.245
Do you make much of God?

671
00:36:43.455 --> 00:36:45.725
Maybe that's just a little symptom of something deeper,

672
00:36:50.985 --> 00:36:53.845
run to the Lord in repentance and obedience,

673
00:37:01.635 --> 00:37:03.925
because remember the point of life,

674
00:37:05.065 --> 00:37:06.845
the reason God created you.

675
00:37:08.105 --> 00:37:12.805
The reason he created me is to make much of Him,

676
00:37:13.745 --> 00:37:18.485
to glorify him, celebrate him

677
00:37:19.665 --> 00:37:22.285
so that all would see and know who he is.

678
00:37:25.265 --> 00:37:30.045
If there's any sliver, just like in my life, the slivers

679
00:37:30.065 --> 00:37:32.725
of things that I still love too much,

680
00:37:33.005 --> 00:37:35.685
I still love more than him, I still give credence to

681
00:37:36.145 --> 00:37:37.725
and trust in more than him.

682
00:37:38.785 --> 00:37:39.805
Ask him to rip that out.

683
00:37:41.235 --> 00:37:45.085
Continually remove those things so that he can be

684
00:37:46.075 --> 00:37:48.245
shining bright through you.

685
00:37:54.535 --> 00:37:56.765
Let's start by singing together this way.

686
00:37:56.765 --> 00:37:58.085
So if you're able, let's stand together

687
00:37:58.085 --> 00:37:59.285
and worship him in response.
