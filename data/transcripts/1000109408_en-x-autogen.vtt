WEBVTT

1
00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:21.755
Well, good morning church, welcome.

2
00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:24.075
Uh, if you are new to our church,

3
00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:25.355
we're so thankful you'd be here.

4
00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:28.675
We hope you can connect here and feel welcomed here

5
00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:31.275
and part of what God is doing in our lives and your life.

6
00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:33.275
Uh, and if you've been here for a long time,

7
00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:35.035
we're also thankful you would be here.

8
00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.155
If you are new, please stop

9
00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:38.155
by the new here area out there in the lobby.

10
00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:39.835
We'd love to meet you and get to know you that way.

11
00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.035
Uh, go ahead and take your copy of God's Word.

12
00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:44.755
Turn with me to the Old Testament book of First Samuel

13
00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:48.955
just getting started in this sermon series called He

14
00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:50.155
Shall Reign.

15
00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:53.675
We're gonna look at chapter one of First Samuels.

16
00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:55.195
We walk through this book together.

17
00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.275
So First Samuel one, again, put that bookmark there.

18
00:00:58.275 --> 00:00:59.875
We'll be there going forward.

19
00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:06.755
All of us have desires, don't we? Yes.

20
00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.275
Like the, the things that we long

21
00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:13.275
to have happened in our lives, the things that we want, need

22
00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:17.115
even like base desires, talking water and food

23
00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:19.275
and community like with things

24
00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:21.595
that we can't really survive without

25
00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:24.235
and that God designed for us to have.

26
00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:29.435
But also there's other desires in our lives like an intimate

27
00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.755
relationship or a solid job or a house

28
00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:36.955
or good grades or athletic success.

29
00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:39.675
And all of those desires can go off track,

30
00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:43.355
but those also can be good and rightly ordered.

31
00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:48.285
Well, 3000 years ago, the nation of Israel also had desires

32
00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:51.885
after being freed from slavery in Egypt,

33
00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:54.525
then wandering the desert for 40 years

34
00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:57.205
and then into the Promised Land they moved.

35
00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:59.125
But things didn't always go well

36
00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:01.725
as they walked that journey.

37
00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:06.485
See, even in the land under God's appointed leaders called

38
00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:09.205
judges, the nation declined morally

39
00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:12.405
and spiritually to where the end of the book

40
00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:13.805
of Judges says this.

41
00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:16.965
Everyone did what was right in their own eyes.

42
00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:21.025
It's how far they had gone.

43
00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:24.425
And so the nation at that moment was longing for stability.

44
00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:27.225
Again, they were longing for security again.

45
00:02:27.225 --> 00:02:30.945
They were longing for safety and prosperity again.

46
00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:33.025
Yet what we'll see is that they were looking

47
00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.785
for those things in the wrong places.

48
00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:41.725
The first narrative out of the box here in First Samuel

49
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.205
introduces us to a few of the stories, main characters,

50
00:02:46.185 --> 00:02:48.765
but it focuses in on this woman named Hannah.

51
00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:53.925
And it, it really puts her life forward as an illustration

52
00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:55.645
of the nation of Israel.

53
00:02:56.865 --> 00:03:01.165
And we watch Hannah and we can learn about their nation and,

54
00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:02.965
and ultimately we'll learn in her life

55
00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:07.205
how her desires were ultimately fulfilled in God alone

56
00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:11.035
and how ours can be as well.

57
00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:14.235
And so let's get our bearings as we enter this book.

58
00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:17.595
Let's look at the first seven verses to begin with here.

59
00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:21.585
This will give us some context as well.

60
00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:23.865
There was a certain man, uh, by the way,

61
00:03:23.895 --> 00:03:26.345
just these words are hard, so gimme grace, please.

62
00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:30.505
Okay, there was a certain man of Ram Z.

63
00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:33.025
There you go. Have that one at lunch discussed.

64
00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:36.185
So we'll see, uh, of the hill country of Ephraim,

65
00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:39.785
whose name was Elna, the son of GE Ham.

66
00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:44.105
Who son of Elihu. Son of Tohu, son of z Anite.

67
00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:46.825
Basically, this man was Elna

68
00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:49.745
and he was from this town, Ramathan zine.

69
00:03:49.745 --> 00:03:51.465
Okay, that's what we need to know. He had two wives.

70
00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.385
The name of the one was Hannah, the name

71
00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:54.465
of the other Panina.

72
00:03:54.685 --> 00:03:57.505
Panina had children, but Hannah had no children.

73
00:03:58.135 --> 00:04:01.185
That sets up a contrast, as we saw last week is important.

74
00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:04.185
Now, this man used to go up year by year from his city

75
00:04:04.245 --> 00:04:07.625
to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts at Shiloh,

76
00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:10.185
where the two sons of Eli, HNI

77
00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:12.145
and Phineas were priests of the Lord.

78
00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:16.035
On the day when Elkin has sacrificed, he would give portions

79
00:04:16.035 --> 00:04:18.635
to Ben, his wife, to all her sons and daughters.

80
00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:20.595
But to Hannah, he gave a double portion

81
00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:24.035
because he loved her though the Lord had closed her womb,

82
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.645
an arrival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her

83
00:04:28.645 --> 00:04:29.925
because the Lord had closed her womb.

84
00:04:30.745 --> 00:04:32.325
And so it went on year by year.

85
00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:34.685
As often as she went up to the house of the Lord, she used

86
00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:39.685
to provoke her, therefore, Hannah wept and would not eat.

87
00:04:40.755 --> 00:04:43.885
There's a lot of background we'll get from there.

88
00:04:43.945 --> 00:04:45.445
But let's first look at the map.

89
00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:48.125
So you need to orient us here as we go

90
00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:49.685
through this, where we're at.

91
00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:51.485
So this is a perspective of where all

92
00:04:51.485 --> 00:04:52.645
of this was even happening.

93
00:04:52.715 --> 00:04:54.565
That town, the long name

94
00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:58.365
that verse one says Anos from is just west of Shiloh.

95
00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:00.445
You can see Shiloh right there in the middle.

96
00:05:00.515 --> 00:05:02.685
It's kind of, the town would be just west of

97
00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:06.605
that in the open area out there about 15 miles away.

98
00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:10.365
They would travel those 15 miles to Shiloh, as it says,

99
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.165
to worship, because Shiloh was

100
00:05:12.165 --> 00:05:14.005
where the tabernacle was placed

101
00:05:14.405 --> 00:05:16.645
whenever the people first entered the land.

102
00:05:16.865 --> 00:05:18.805
Uh, many years before that.

103
00:05:19.075 --> 00:05:20.445
It's where the Ark of the Covenant was.

104
00:05:20.475 --> 00:05:23.645
It's where Israel had placed the place of worship.

105
00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:26.685
So that's where Eli, the priest and his sons were serving.

106
00:05:26.685 --> 00:05:28.565
That's where people would go to sacrifice.

107
00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:32.765
That'll matter in the next few weeks with Eli and his sons.

108
00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:35.245
But that's again where Elkin all was taking his family

109
00:05:35.465 --> 00:05:36.645
to go to worship.

110
00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:41.005
But again, our primary goal today is to understand

111
00:05:41.185 --> 00:05:44.845
and to think about Hannah, this woman who

112
00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.765
we see was one of his wives.

113
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:51.245
So, so to start with, what we need to do is feel the despair

114
00:05:52.225 --> 00:05:56.125
in her life that this passage reveals to us.

115
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:59.925
You saw it right away. The contrast pen had children.

116
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:03.005
Hannah had no children. The Lord closed her womb.

117
00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:04.645
You saw that twice, right? This is the picture,

118
00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:06.965
it's painting of the despair.

119
00:06:07.105 --> 00:06:10.365
Did you not feel it as you read through this, right?

120
00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:11.965
Hannah was childless

121
00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:15.085
and back then being childless was seen very negatively.

122
00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:20.235
It was almost like you were, you were being cursed by God

123
00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:23.235
or a God, in fact, being barren, not even able

124
00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:24.595
to have children was even worse.

125
00:06:27.505 --> 00:06:30.965
Not only that, she's face-to-face with this guy's other wife

126
00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:32.405
who was apparently very fruitful.

127
00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:36.805
And so there was this never ending contrast set up in her

128
00:06:36.805 --> 00:06:38.365
life where she was always,

129
00:06:38.945 --> 00:06:40.405
she couldn't get away from feeling

130
00:06:40.405 --> 00:06:41.645
like she didn't measure up.

131
00:06:43.765 --> 00:06:46.245
I can't do what you can do. I can't do this.

132
00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.205
And that's actually, again, indicative

133
00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:49.925
of the way Israel was feeling.

134
00:06:50.065 --> 00:06:53.885
At the same time, Israel as a whole,

135
00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:57.445
they were declining morally and spiritually.

136
00:06:57.745 --> 00:06:59.645
And so what we would say is there was a

137
00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:01.165
barrenness in the nation.

138
00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:04.525
There was suffering in the nation as a result of

139
00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:05.765
what they were doing.

140
00:07:05.795 --> 00:07:08.365
They looked around then at all of these other nations,

141
00:07:08.365 --> 00:07:10.085
and comparatively they were less than

142
00:07:11.175 --> 00:07:12.925
these other nations had strong armies.

143
00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:15.245
They were wealthy, they were less than.

144
00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:18.645
And so what Israel started doing was desiring things

145
00:07:18.915 --> 00:07:22.485
that could give them safety and stature with others.

146
00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:29.805
I wonder if some of us might feel like Hannah today

147
00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:34.955
or like Israel at that time.

148
00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:39.925
And I, I don't know all the stories, but I know a lot.

149
00:07:39.945 --> 00:07:42.205
But, but maybe you literally are childless.

150
00:07:43.825 --> 00:07:47.485
You are unable to have children biologically

151
00:07:48.725 --> 00:07:52.105
and and there's this, this lack you feel in your soul.

152
00:07:55.395 --> 00:07:58.975
Or, or maybe it's like, if, if I can just get married, then

153
00:07:58.975 --> 00:08:01.895
that's, that's gonna, that's gonna make my life fulfill it.

154
00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:07.205
Or if you could just advance at work a little bit, then man,

155
00:08:07.205 --> 00:08:08.205
safety and security

156
00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:09.765
for your family is gonna be taken care of.

157
00:08:09.785 --> 00:08:11.165
If I can just get to that next level,

158
00:08:12.505 --> 00:08:16.235
Or If I could just get the part in the play,

159
00:08:16.235 --> 00:08:19.595
or if I could just make the team then, then my, my status as

160
00:08:20.275 --> 00:08:23.955
a peer in my school will be finally fixed and I'll be safe.

161
00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:30.795
I've wrestled with this. So for me, I've,

162
00:08:30.795 --> 00:08:33.435
I've allowed health to sit on that throne.

163
00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:37.485
And for the majority of my life, I've been really healthy.

164
00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:39.885
And if, if I'm healthy, if my family's healthy

165
00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:41.845
and my kids aren't sick, then man, everything's good.

166
00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:46.525
I'm, I'm fine. But as soon as any of those desires,

167
00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:47.685
as soon as that one for me

168
00:08:47.685 --> 00:08:51.645
or that one for you, any of those desires are not met.

169
00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:52.875
What happens?

170
00:08:53.755 --> 00:08:57.165
Despair. We,

171
00:08:57.225 --> 00:09:01.355
We, we crumble, despair creeps in.

172
00:09:01.355 --> 00:09:02.875
And so then what do we do in response?

173
00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:06.195
We, We feel this lack, we feel this hurt.

174
00:09:06.225 --> 00:09:09.195
What do we do in response? We look for a solution.

175
00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:15.125
We try to manufacture an answer to the problem.

176
00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:19.765
But what we see next in this passage is the futility

177
00:09:20.265 --> 00:09:22.805
of man's solutions to that despair.

178
00:09:25.445 --> 00:09:26.905
We, we feel the despair with Hannah.

179
00:09:26.925 --> 00:09:29.185
We feel it in our own lives. We see the, the futility

180
00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:33.065
of solutions that we can provide to that despair.

181
00:09:33.065 --> 00:09:36.825
Just consider the futility of what is happening here.

182
00:09:36.845 --> 00:09:38.185
You already saw it a little bit

183
00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:42.665
with Elana giving Hannah a double portion of the sacrifice.

184
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:46.105
Basically, he gave her a double portion of food to try

185
00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:50.225
to show concern for her life that she was lacking this part.

186
00:09:51.955 --> 00:09:53.345
Which by the way, I was thinking about this.

187
00:09:53.345 --> 00:09:55.065
It's really romantic, isn't it ladies?

188
00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:59.065
Uh, I, I heard a commentator talk about this, that he,

189
00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.225
he described elna as winking across the table

190
00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:03.545
as he put a double portion of mashed potatoes on her plate.

191
00:10:03.565 --> 00:10:06.345
You know, like there you go, right?

192
00:10:06.835 --> 00:10:11.305
Don't you just swoon when you hear that ladies? No.

193
00:10:13.575 --> 00:10:18.395
But in reality, this was an effort by a good godly man

194
00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:21.395
to bless her to show that he cared for her condition.

195
00:10:21.415 --> 00:10:23.755
He was trying to meet a need in her life.

196
00:10:23.755 --> 00:10:27.995
There was just absolutely no way That what he was trying

197
00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:30.805
to do could fill that hole in her heart.

198
00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:37.365
It's actually the same thing we see in verse eight.

199
00:10:37.395 --> 00:10:38.725
Look at this. We continue on.

200
00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:41.365
He says, Elana, her husband said to her,

201
00:10:41.365 --> 00:10:42.845
Hannah, why do you weep?

202
00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:45.365
Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad?

203
00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:49.365
Am I not more to you than 10 sons?

204
00:10:51.215 --> 00:10:53.025
Basically, if the food's not cutting it,

205
00:10:53.155 --> 00:10:56.025
maybe then he could be enough for her.

206
00:10:56.025 --> 00:10:59.225
Like he's the hero husband coming to the rescue.

207
00:10:59.415 --> 00:11:00.625
Like, am I not enough

208
00:11:04.795 --> 00:11:06.895
Now he does seem like a good dude, but,

209
00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:10.955
but would a relationship be enough for her?

210
00:11:11.525 --> 00:11:11.875
Would

211
00:11:16.735 --> 00:11:19.815
It be worth more than 10 sons to her?

212
00:11:21.335 --> 00:11:25.325
No, Because the desire of her heart was

213
00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:28.965
to have a son because the shame

214
00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:30.845
and social stigma that came

215
00:11:30.845 --> 00:11:35.085
with being childless would then be removed if she had a son.

216
00:11:38.695 --> 00:11:43.635
It's similar to Israel trying all kinds of other ways

217
00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:48.495
to cover their shame, to recover the stability

218
00:11:48.595 --> 00:11:51.015
and prosperity and safety that they once had.

219
00:11:51.015 --> 00:11:55.075
But now they've lost it. They tried everything they could.

220
00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.135
The entire book of judges again, right

221
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.735
before this one, the entire book

222
00:12:00.735 --> 00:12:03.255
of judges is one long narrative about the people turning

223
00:12:03.485 --> 00:12:08.095
away from God and to other idols, to other gods.

224
00:12:08.925 --> 00:12:11.895
This futile search for fulfillment that they could never

225
00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:17.115
satisfy, satisfied, it never delivered on its promise.

226
00:12:17.215 --> 00:12:21.965
It was never enough. Again,

227
00:12:21.965 --> 00:12:23.605
isn't that the same for us today?

228
00:12:26.855 --> 00:12:28.155
We are surrounded by a culture

229
00:12:28.185 --> 00:12:29.915
that tells us we're lacking something.

230
00:12:32.135 --> 00:12:35.485
Every one of us, every commercial, you're lacking something.

231
00:12:35.825 --> 00:12:38.525
I'm lacking something. Every ad is I'm lacking something

232
00:12:38.525 --> 00:12:41.605
that then creates despair in my life, which then leads

233
00:12:41.605 --> 00:12:43.965
to finding solution after solution.

234
00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:49.145
If only you had a better education,

235
00:12:50.925 --> 00:12:52.745
if only we had a bigger house.

236
00:12:55.185 --> 00:12:57.885
If only you had a, a husband that loved you,

237
00:12:58.505 --> 00:13:00.925
if only you had a wife that respected you.

238
00:13:01.995 --> 00:13:04.615
If only the, if only, if only, right?

239
00:13:04.675 --> 00:13:06.535
That's a solution after solution.

240
00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:08.615
Some people try those things.

241
00:13:10.225 --> 00:13:12.535
Other people try solutions to numb the pain,

242
00:13:12.755 --> 00:13:16.015
to numb the despair, drugs, alcohol, all kinds of

243
00:13:16.535 --> 00:13:18.575
pleasure seeking just to, to make it go away.

244
00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:26.335
We can even handle God like this,

245
00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:29.575
where we seek solutions.

246
00:13:31.785 --> 00:13:33.985
'cause deep down we know we're sinners,

247
00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:39.045
and deep down we know that God is not happy with the way

248
00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:40.205
that we've lived our lives.

249
00:13:42.015 --> 00:13:43.155
So we seek solutions.

250
00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:46.235
We, We clean up our life a little bit.

251
00:13:46.295 --> 00:13:48.755
We go to church more. We try to stop cussing.

252
00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:51.795
We give some money.

253
00:13:51.855 --> 00:13:53.835
We, we try to throw our phone away for a while,

254
00:13:53.835 --> 00:13:54.915
but then we just dig it back outta there.

255
00:13:54.915 --> 00:13:58.995
Like we, we just try solution after solution.

256
00:13:59.335 --> 00:14:02.035
But listen, as good as those things might be in our lives,

257
00:14:02.065 --> 00:14:05.715
they are not the answer to life's shame and guilt.

258
00:14:09.075 --> 00:14:13.365
They're futile in the end before a holy God.

259
00:14:17.605 --> 00:14:19.105
And here's what those solutions do,

260
00:14:19.655 --> 00:14:23.435
even the religious solutions, they lead

261
00:14:23.535 --> 00:14:25.515
to desolation.

262
00:14:26.935 --> 00:14:30.515
And we see it here that, that those efforts Israel had

263
00:14:30.735 --> 00:14:32.675
to try to cover their shame led

264
00:14:32.675 --> 00:14:34.555
to the desolation of their faith.

265
00:14:37.205 --> 00:14:40.225
All of judges leading up to what we see here,

266
00:14:40.225 --> 00:14:41.465
even in chapter one.

267
00:14:41.845 --> 00:14:46.745
Notice the desolation of faith in Israel at this time.

268
00:14:49.675 --> 00:14:50.985
Let's continue reading in the story.

269
00:14:51.085 --> 00:14:55.975
Look at verses nine through 14, After they'd eaten

270
00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:57.935
and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah Rose.

271
00:14:58.185 --> 00:14:59.375
We'll come back to that Now.

272
00:14:59.635 --> 00:15:02.575
Eli, the priest, was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost

273
00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:03.655
of the temple of the Lord.

274
00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.775
Hannah was deeply distressed

275
00:15:05.775 --> 00:15:07.695
and prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly.

276
00:15:07.695 --> 00:15:09.135
And she vowed of vow

277
00:15:09.155 --> 00:15:10.855
and said, oh Lord of hosts,

278
00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:13.535
if you'll indeed look on the affliction of your servant,

279
00:15:14.295 --> 00:15:15.895
remember me and not forget your servant,

280
00:15:16.155 --> 00:15:19.375
but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him

281
00:15:19.475 --> 00:15:21.695
to the Lord all the days of his life.

282
00:15:22.275 --> 00:15:23.655
No razor shall touch his head.

283
00:15:24.885 --> 00:15:25.985
As she continued praying

284
00:15:25.985 --> 00:15:28.985
before the Lord, Eli observed her mouth,

285
00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:32.265
Hannah was speaking in her heart, only her lips moved

286
00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:34.185
and her voice was not her.

287
00:15:34.245 --> 00:15:35.865
She was praying quietly.

288
00:15:35.865 --> 00:15:38.305
Therefore, Eli took her to be a drunken woman.

289
00:15:39.245 --> 00:15:41.985
And Eli said to her, how long will you go on being drunk?

290
00:15:42.325 --> 00:15:44.025
Put your wine away from you.

291
00:15:46.285 --> 00:15:49.505
So I've already talked about the spiritual wasteland

292
00:15:49.695 --> 00:15:51.745
that Israel was at that time.

293
00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:54.985
There was rampant sin, abuse, idolatry,

294
00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:56.225
all over the book of Judges.

295
00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:57.785
We looked at that a couple years ago, right?

296
00:15:57.785 --> 00:15:59.225
There is so much happening there,

297
00:15:59.405 --> 00:16:03.345
but we'll see it again later in Eli with his sons.

298
00:16:03.555 --> 00:16:04.825
We'll see that in a couple of weeks.

299
00:16:05.085 --> 00:16:09.235
But even here, Right Eli,

300
00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:11.675
this supposed priest of God,

301
00:16:13.925 --> 00:16:15.865
he thought this woman praying quietly at the

302
00:16:15.865 --> 00:16:16.985
tabernacle was drunk.

303
00:16:19.515 --> 00:16:20.615
Had he not seen it before?

304
00:16:20.645 --> 00:16:22.175
Like has it been that long since

305
00:16:22.175 --> 00:16:23.375
you've seen somebody pray like this?

306
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:24.695
Or was he just whatever?

307
00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:26.095
We don't know exactly,

308
00:16:26.475 --> 00:16:29.495
but if he was truly tapped into the Lord,

309
00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:35.735
if he was truly hearing from God as a priest,

310
00:16:36.205 --> 00:16:39.415
this woman's uncommon devotion would not have

311
00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:40.455
been a surprise to him.

312
00:16:43.165 --> 00:16:45.225
He would've encouraged instead of criticized.

313
00:16:49.435 --> 00:16:51.535
But listen, that was the state of Israel back then.

314
00:16:53.525 --> 00:16:55.815
That was what was happening back then.

315
00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:59.135
Eli was a miniature of what the nation was experiencing.

316
00:16:59.945 --> 00:17:01.415
There were very few prophets.

317
00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:04.015
There were very few ways that,

318
00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:06.095
that people were genuinely following God.

319
00:17:06.095 --> 00:17:08.815
That was a shock when devotion happened

320
00:17:08.815 --> 00:17:12.495
because of the desolation of of Israel's faith.

321
00:17:17.275 --> 00:17:18.685
It's the same thing that you and I taste

322
00:17:18.685 --> 00:17:19.725
when we run away from God,

323
00:17:19.775 --> 00:17:20.775
Isn't it?

324
00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:28.345
Here's the truth. Sin always over promises

325
00:17:28.765 --> 00:17:29.905
and under delivers.

326
00:17:33.145 --> 00:17:36.865
It will never fulfill what it says it's going to.

327
00:17:39.085 --> 00:17:40.945
It always over promises and under delivers.

328
00:17:40.945 --> 00:17:43.025
It will never satisfy what we think it will satisfy.

329
00:17:43.325 --> 00:17:48.145
And God will often let us walk through the heartache

330
00:17:48.405 --> 00:17:50.885
and carnage of our decisions

331
00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:57.115
because he wants to remind us that we were designed

332
00:17:57.615 --> 00:18:00.275
to need him not to run away from him.

333
00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:06.705
Because that's what God was doing here in Israel, right?

334
00:18:07.885 --> 00:18:09.865
That's what he was doing here where,

335
00:18:10.195 --> 00:18:12.745
where he was setting up a new day, a time

336
00:18:12.845 --> 00:18:14.865
to draw his people back to himself.

337
00:18:14.865 --> 00:18:16.225
They'd run away for so long.

338
00:18:16.685 --> 00:18:18.185
Now he's saying, Nope, it's a new day.

339
00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:21.265
I'm coming to you to bring you back to myself.

340
00:18:21.405 --> 00:18:24.865
And all over scripture that often happens

341
00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:27.025
through a miraculous birth.

342
00:18:29.205 --> 00:18:31.855
This fresh start, this kind of new day happens

343
00:18:31.855 --> 00:18:34.055
through a miraculous birth.

344
00:18:36.975 --> 00:18:40.515
We see it with Abraham, we see it here.

345
00:18:42.115 --> 00:18:44.975
We eventually see it with a virgin birth.

346
00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:50.425
That's where this story shows up a number of times

347
00:18:50.565 --> 00:18:52.425
as God's saying, Nope, here's a fresh start.

348
00:18:52.525 --> 00:18:53.905
I'm gonna, I'm gonna start anew.

349
00:18:54.525 --> 00:18:57.185
Here's a baby, I'm gonna start anew.

350
00:18:57.185 --> 00:19:00.305
Here's a baby till Bethlehem 2000 years ago.

351
00:19:00.525 --> 00:19:02.625
We get the final fresh start.

352
00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:04.065
But here's what that means for us.

353
00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:08.105
As we experience desolation, as we experience hard times

354
00:19:09.385 --> 00:19:12.885
struggle, This means we should not run

355
00:19:12.915 --> 00:19:14.905
away during those times.

356
00:19:16.235 --> 00:19:20.205
Because what God is probably doing is he's using that

357
00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:22.125
to bring about something beautiful.

358
00:19:23.555 --> 00:19:25.525
He's opening the door to something powerful.

359
00:19:26.685 --> 00:19:28.375
He's Saying, I've got something new.

360
00:19:28.715 --> 00:19:29.735
Here's what's coming.

361
00:19:30.905 --> 00:19:33.925
So don't run away in that because that's what we see next.

362
00:19:33.955 --> 00:19:38.045
Even in this spiritually dark land that Israel was,

363
00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:43.045
God uses the uniqueness of Hannah's faith here.

364
00:19:44.745 --> 00:19:47.645
God uses the uniqueness of Hannah's faith.

365
00:19:47.865 --> 00:19:50.325
See it here, right? In the contrast to

366
00:19:50.325 --> 00:19:52.165
what Eli was like in contrast to

367
00:19:52.165 --> 00:19:55.165
what the judges were like in contrast to all of that,

368
00:19:55.555 --> 00:19:58.605
look at how Hannah is faithful.

369
00:19:58.635 --> 00:20:00.605
Look at the first part of verse nine again.

370
00:20:00.725 --> 00:20:05.155
I said, we'll come back to this after they'd eaten

371
00:20:05.155 --> 00:20:07.675
and drunk, meaning after they'd worshiped in Shiloh,

372
00:20:08.015 --> 00:20:09.315
Hannah Rose.

373
00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:12.635
Now to us, we read that

374
00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:15.155
and we think, okay, well she was sitting on the floor

375
00:20:15.335 --> 00:20:17.075
and just got up.

376
00:20:17.135 --> 00:20:18.755
Is that like what? What's the big deal?

377
00:20:20.565 --> 00:20:23.935
Well, in the original language, that word brings

378
00:20:23.935 --> 00:20:25.255
with it a conviction,

379
00:20:27.415 --> 00:20:29.255
a settled disposition.

380
00:20:30.735 --> 00:20:32.265
There's something that changed

381
00:20:33.535 --> 00:20:34.535
In Hannah.

382
00:20:37.145 --> 00:20:41.045
See in the storm of her rival provoking her.

383
00:20:43.095 --> 00:20:44.155
God worked in her heart.

384
00:20:46.095 --> 00:20:48.705
She didn't run away away in the desolation.

385
00:20:49.205 --> 00:20:52.705
She allowed God to work in it in her.

386
00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:55.705
And so she went to the temple.

387
00:20:55.885 --> 00:20:57.545
She was still grieving, still hurting.

388
00:20:57.645 --> 00:20:59.025
She still didn't have a son.

389
00:20:59.045 --> 00:21:00.985
But did you see her prayer in verse 11?

390
00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:03.545
Did you see her vow to the Lord? Look at it again.

391
00:21:03.725 --> 00:21:05.865
She vowed vows, said, oh Lord of hosts,

392
00:21:05.865 --> 00:21:08.505
if you'll indeed look on the affliction of your servant,

393
00:21:09.345 --> 00:21:10.785
remember me, not forget your servant,

394
00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:12.505
but will give your servant a son.

395
00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:15.465
I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life.

396
00:21:15.965 --> 00:21:17.945
And no razor shall touch his head

397
00:21:18.955 --> 00:21:20.565
like she knew God cared for her.

398
00:21:20.665 --> 00:21:23.125
She knew God heard her, that he was listening

399
00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:25.565
and he was, he was with her.

400
00:21:25.585 --> 00:21:28.325
And so she was so committed to him

401
00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:32.545
that she didn't even need to have

402
00:21:33.095 --> 00:21:34.985
that desire fulfilled anymore.

403
00:21:36.105 --> 00:21:39.205
Did you see that? How different this was?

404
00:21:39.205 --> 00:21:41.045
Because what she say she would do with the Son,

405
00:21:41.185 --> 00:21:44.045
if God did happen to give her a son, what would she do?

406
00:21:44.305 --> 00:21:46.405
She would dedicate him to the Lord's service.

407
00:21:48.195 --> 00:21:51.485
What she's referring to here is called the Nazarite vow.

408
00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:55.485
You saw it with Samson, you saw it

409
00:21:55.485 --> 00:21:57.365
with John the Baptist in the New Testament,

410
00:21:57.795 --> 00:22:00.005
this Nazarite vow that they would not cut their hair.

411
00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.245
This was a commitment to serve the Lord.

412
00:22:02.245 --> 00:22:04.445
They wouldn't drink wine, doesn't touch any dead animal.

413
00:22:04.475 --> 00:22:06.605
They would serve the Lord with their whole life.

414
00:22:09.365 --> 00:22:10.385
And it was an indication

415
00:22:10.445 --> 00:22:13.425
of set apartness that they're different.

416
00:22:13.425 --> 00:22:15.145
There's something unique here.

417
00:22:16.045 --> 00:22:18.425
And she was saying, my son, if you give my son

418
00:22:18.425 --> 00:22:19.665
to me, I'm gonna give him to you.

419
00:22:21.265 --> 00:22:24.825
He's all yours. Like, don't miss this.

420
00:22:26.315 --> 00:22:27.585
Don't miss Hannah's faith.

421
00:22:27.645 --> 00:22:29.785
She had such faith in God that she was willing

422
00:22:30.325 --> 00:22:33.865
to give up this fulfillment of her desire

423
00:22:35.815 --> 00:22:39.185
because she was so satisfied in God himself.

424
00:22:40.395 --> 00:22:45.345
You see that she

425
00:22:45.345 --> 00:22:48.785
was so satisfied that she was willing to give up this child

426
00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:51.625
that she'd prayed for and,

427
00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:53.705
and did you see, she wasn't even upset about it.

428
00:22:55.705 --> 00:22:58.485
You remember the, the story of the rich young ruler came up

429
00:22:58.485 --> 00:23:00.605
to Jesus and he did all this stuff.

430
00:23:00.605 --> 00:23:01.845
And he's like, yeah, I'm, I'm right, right?

431
00:23:01.845 --> 00:23:02.925
Jesus, what else do I need to do? And

432
00:23:02.925 --> 00:23:04.045
Jesus is like, you gotta sell everything.

433
00:23:05.315 --> 00:23:08.125
Give to the poor and come follow me. And he went away

434
00:23:08.785 --> 00:23:09.785
Sad. It says

435
00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:10.225

436
00:23:12.085 --> 00:23:14.145
He wasn't willing to give up everything.

437
00:23:14.805 --> 00:23:16.825
He didn't see Jesus as his treasure.

438
00:23:16.965 --> 00:23:18.985
He saw his treasure as his treasure.

439
00:23:21.575 --> 00:23:24.635
But, but look at this. Look at the end of verse 18.

440
00:23:29.415 --> 00:23:32.595
The woman went her way. Hannah went her way and ate.

441
00:23:32.615 --> 00:23:34.755
And her face was no longer

442
00:23:35.095 --> 00:23:38.945
sad, this commitment.

443
00:23:39.405 --> 00:23:43.505
And she's willing to give him up. She was no longer sad.

444
00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:45.725
We'll see this next week as we look at her at her song,

445
00:23:45.865 --> 00:23:49.325
she prays in response in chapter two.

446
00:23:49.325 --> 00:23:51.245
We'll see it next week. That there is a deep

447
00:23:51.425 --> 00:23:53.205
rooted joy in Hannah.

448
00:23:53.385 --> 00:23:58.335
Now, something is different in the storm

449
00:23:58.395 --> 00:24:00.695
of being provoked, something is different.

450
00:24:00.715 --> 00:24:05.125
Why was it different? Because she trusted God in the middle

451
00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:07.325
of a difficult, impossible situation.

452
00:24:07.825 --> 00:24:11.445
In spite of that, she had faith in him, said, God,

453
00:24:11.445 --> 00:24:12.565
you're who I trust.

454
00:24:12.665 --> 00:24:14.245
You are who I want.

455
00:24:14.395 --> 00:24:17.045
This plot line throw shows up throughout the Bible

456
00:24:19.665 --> 00:24:22.415
where in the face of opposition, the face of struggle,

457
00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:24.935
God uses the faith of one man

458
00:24:25.075 --> 00:24:27.655
or one woman to bring something about that he wanted to do.

459
00:24:29.235 --> 00:24:32.965
It's all over the place. Joseph right sold into slavery.

460
00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:37.685
God be uses him to be the savior of his fa family.

461
00:24:38.255 --> 00:24:40.565
Bring him to Egypt, save their lives, his whole nation.

462
00:24:42.375 --> 00:24:44.325
Moses led his people outta slavery,

463
00:24:44.625 --> 00:24:45.765
led them into promised land,

464
00:24:45.765 --> 00:24:46.965
right towards the promised land.

465
00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:49.245
That's what God did through the faith of Moses,

466
00:24:49.315 --> 00:24:50.805
even when everybody else didn't wanna do it.

467
00:24:52.985 --> 00:24:54.005
Joshua, Caleb,

468
00:24:54.315 --> 00:24:56.765
they trusted God would give them the land in the face

469
00:24:56.765 --> 00:24:58.245
of giants and massive armies.

470
00:24:58.245 --> 00:25:03.095
They said, no, our god's bigger than that prophet

471
00:25:03.145 --> 00:25:06.655
after prophet standing as lone voices in Israel,

472
00:25:06.655 --> 00:25:08.055
calling their people back to God.

473
00:25:11.815 --> 00:25:16.615
Mary scorned

474
00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:21.235
by the world, believing God could use a humble

475
00:25:21.255 --> 00:25:23.035
virgin to carry the savior of the world.

476
00:25:26.835 --> 00:25:31.785
Even Jesus who was walking that journey at the end alone,

477
00:25:34.625 --> 00:25:38.985
carrying the weight of our sin, trusting his father's will.

478
00:25:41.225 --> 00:25:43.605
God uses that to change eternity for those who believe.

479
00:25:44.665 --> 00:25:48.375
Right? So the faith, the unique, even if it looks crazy,

480
00:25:48.675 --> 00:25:52.095
the unique faith of one person, God uses that

481
00:25:52.155 --> 00:25:53.895
to change the story.

482
00:25:54.115 --> 00:25:56.615
He does it for Hannah. Where Samuel becomes the prophet.

483
00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:59.255
We'll see in the next few weeks that changes the course

484
00:25:59.595 --> 00:26:02.775
of Israel, the faith of a woman.

485
00:26:04.515 --> 00:26:06.455
God used to change everything.

486
00:26:06.475 --> 00:26:08.975
See, God never promises that our lives will be easy.

487
00:26:10.675 --> 00:26:12.985
Never promises that we'll get everything that we ask for

488
00:26:12.985 --> 00:26:14.345
that we would long for.

489
00:26:14.445 --> 00:26:18.305
But he does say that when we trust him in the middle of it,

490
00:26:18.405 --> 00:26:19.625
that's where he shows up.

491
00:26:19.725 --> 00:26:23.665
That's how he works. No matter what we're facing,

492
00:26:23.965 --> 00:26:25.065
God says, trust

493
00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:26.125
Me. And

494
00:26:26.125 --> 00:26:27.585
he works through that 'cause.

495
00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:28.785
That's what Hannah got to experience.

496
00:26:29.645 --> 00:26:30.945
That's what she got to see.

497
00:26:30.945 --> 00:26:33.745
Look at this, the grace of God's provision.

498
00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:38.335
She got to see it. She got to cherish it.

499
00:26:38.755 --> 00:26:41.015
The grace of God's provision in her life.

500
00:26:45.055 --> 00:26:48.305
Look at verse 14 again, down through verse 18.

501
00:26:48.565 --> 00:26:51.145
Eli said to her, how long will you go on being drunk?

502
00:26:51.325 --> 00:26:53.145
Put your wine away from you.

503
00:26:53.325 --> 00:26:55.265
But Hannah answered, no, my Lord,

504
00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:56.945
I'm a woman troubled in spirit.

505
00:26:57.145 --> 00:26:58.945
I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink.

506
00:26:59.175 --> 00:27:02.185
I've been pouring out my soul before the Lord.

507
00:27:03.525 --> 00:27:05.625
Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman.

508
00:27:05.725 --> 00:27:08.305
For all along, I've been speaking out of my great anxiety

509
00:27:08.525 --> 00:27:10.585
and vexation, meaning I've just been troubled.

510
00:27:10.585 --> 00:27:13.065
I've been hurt. I've just been praying outta my heart, man.

511
00:27:13.085 --> 00:27:14.085
That's all I'm doing.

512
00:27:15.775 --> 00:27:18.795
And Then Eli answered, go in peace. The God of Israel.

513
00:27:18.925 --> 00:27:20.795
Grant your petition that you

514
00:27:20.955 --> 00:27:22.115
Have made to him.

515
00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:25.955
And she said, let your servant find favor in your eyes.

516
00:27:25.975 --> 00:27:27.035
And the woman went away

517
00:27:27.895 --> 00:27:28.895
And Ate. And her face

518
00:27:28.895 --> 00:27:30.115
was no longer

519
00:27:30.935 --> 00:27:31.935
Sad.

520
00:27:34.065 --> 00:27:35.405
See, she knew that

521
00:27:35.405 --> 00:27:36.765
God was gonna do what he said he was gonna do.

522
00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:42.125
She believed that She had faith. She trusted him to do

523
00:27:42.515 --> 00:27:43.515
That.

524
00:27:44.845 --> 00:27:46.945
And look what happens next verses 19 and 20.

525
00:27:46.945 --> 00:27:49.585
They arose early in the morning and worship before the Lord.

526
00:27:49.775 --> 00:27:51.665
They went back to their house at Rama,

527
00:27:51.805 --> 00:27:54.705
and Elon knew Hannah, his wife, and the Lord remembered her.

528
00:27:54.965 --> 00:27:57.985
And in due time, Hannah conceived and bore a son.

529
00:27:58.805 --> 00:28:02.225
And she called his name Samuel for she said, I've asked

530
00:28:02.245 --> 00:28:03.385
for him from the Lord.

531
00:28:03.385 --> 00:28:05.425
That's the name Samuel. That's what it means. Asked

532
00:28:05.605 --> 00:28:06.605
Of God.

533
00:28:07.765 --> 00:28:09.985
The baby I asked God gave

534
00:28:13.855 --> 00:28:14.855
Isn't God good?

535
00:28:16.115 --> 00:28:17.485
Like When we wait on the Lord,

536
00:28:18.275 --> 00:28:21.605
When We trust him for his ways, for his timing in this,

537
00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:23.725
he blesses his people.

538
00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:27.245
This barren woman who'd been cast off from society.

539
00:28:27.245 --> 00:28:31.125
Even in her own family, God gave her a son in response

540
00:28:31.145 --> 00:28:35.645
to her faith-filled request to responding to her

541
00:28:36.725 --> 00:28:37.805
satisfied joy in the Lord.

542
00:28:40.905 --> 00:28:45.295
Again, it's similar to Israel, barren suffering.

543
00:28:45.445 --> 00:28:46.975
They were waiting on God.

544
00:28:47.235 --> 00:28:50.975
And then a, a prophet named Samuel was given to them,

545
00:28:52.575 --> 00:28:54.525
which led to a model king

546
00:28:54.525 --> 00:28:58.455
Named David being given to them, which

547
00:28:58.455 --> 00:29:01.535
Eventually through that family led to the perfect

548
00:29:01.725 --> 00:29:04.655
King named Jesus being given

549
00:29:07.255 --> 00:29:08.255
Israel. Baron

550
00:29:08.255 --> 00:29:09.075
waiting. God

551
00:29:09.785 --> 00:29:11.115
Gave grace.

552
00:29:13.715 --> 00:29:14.895
Yet, yet, I want you to see

553
00:29:14.895 --> 00:29:16.135
something here in Hannah's story.

554
00:29:17.675 --> 00:29:20.175
See, It wasn't that her joy was fulfilled

555
00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:22.255
When she got pregnant.

556
00:29:22.755 --> 00:29:26.425
Did you see that Her

557
00:29:26.605 --> 00:29:28.505
Joy in God was fulfilled?

558
00:29:29.615 --> 00:29:30.745
Then she got pregnant.

559
00:29:32.755 --> 00:29:35.455
That's out of order to what we typically think.

560
00:29:36.515 --> 00:29:38.095
And when God answers our prayer, then we're like,

561
00:29:38.095 --> 00:29:39.335
yes, praise God.

562
00:29:39.335 --> 00:29:41.405
Our joy is fulfilled. No, no, no.

563
00:29:41.705 --> 00:29:44.245
She had her joy fulfilled in God first

564
00:29:44.545 --> 00:29:46.165
and then she got pregnant later.

565
00:29:50.045 --> 00:29:53.675
Again. Her deepest needs were

566
00:29:54.575 --> 00:29:57.515
not met in the fulfillment of her desire.

567
00:29:58.715 --> 00:30:02.615
Her deepest needs were met in the fulfillment of her desire

568
00:30:02.835 --> 00:30:06.615
for God and Him alone.

569
00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:12.135
More than a husband, more than one son, more than 10 sons.

570
00:30:12.355 --> 00:30:14.135
It was fulfilled in God.

571
00:30:14.285 --> 00:30:18.775
That is faith, that's rejoicing even

572
00:30:18.795 --> 00:30:22.055
before you get the desire met.

573
00:30:23.825 --> 00:30:25.565
That's what he's talking about here.

574
00:30:25.765 --> 00:30:27.565
'cause look at how her prayer shifted. Did you see this?

575
00:30:28.625 --> 00:30:30.645
Her prayer shifted where probably

576
00:30:30.645 --> 00:30:32.965
before this moment was, God, give me a son

577
00:30:33.225 --> 00:30:35.445
to make up this deficiency in my life.

578
00:30:35.605 --> 00:30:38.365
I need a son. I'm getting chastised

579
00:30:38.365 --> 00:30:40.645
by my peers, by my family.

580
00:30:41.505 --> 00:30:43.285
God, give me a son to make up deficiency.

581
00:30:44.105 --> 00:30:48.745
Now notice, God, you are all I need.

582
00:30:50.165 --> 00:30:53.295
Give me a son so he can be yours.

583
00:30:54.785 --> 00:30:59.545
See that God gimme a son so he can be yours. That's a shift.

584
00:30:59.645 --> 00:31:01.545
And we see it play out here in the last section

585
00:31:01.565 --> 00:31:02.625
of chapter one.

586
00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:04.425
Look at verses 21 through 28.

587
00:31:06.815 --> 00:31:08.915
The man, Elena and all his house went up to offer

588
00:31:08.915 --> 00:31:11.235
to the Lord the yearly sacrifice to pay his vow.

589
00:31:11.415 --> 00:31:13.835
But Hannah did not go up for, she said to her husband,

590
00:31:14.135 --> 00:31:16.515
as soon as the child is weaned, I'll bring him so

591
00:31:16.515 --> 00:31:18.475
that he may appear in the presence of the Lord

592
00:31:18.495 --> 00:31:19.875
and dwell there forever.

593
00:31:20.255 --> 00:31:24.395
She was committed to her vow Elkin, her husband said to her,

594
00:31:24.395 --> 00:31:25.595
well, do what seems best to you.

595
00:31:25.665 --> 00:31:26.955
Wait till you've weaned him.

596
00:31:26.955 --> 00:31:29.115
Only may the Lord establish his word.

597
00:31:29.295 --> 00:31:30.715
She He, he agreed with her.

598
00:31:30.715 --> 00:31:32.435
And so the woman remained and nursed her son

599
00:31:32.435 --> 00:31:34.995
until she weaned him, which was about 3-year-old.

600
00:31:34.995 --> 00:31:36.795
3, 3, 3 years old.

601
00:31:36.855 --> 00:31:40.115
At the time when she'd weaned him, she took him up

602
00:31:40.115 --> 00:31:43.475
with her along with probably three bulls, an iffa

603
00:31:43.475 --> 00:31:44.995
of flour, a skin of wine.

604
00:31:45.215 --> 00:31:47.835
And she brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh.

605
00:31:48.015 --> 00:31:49.275
And the child was young.

606
00:31:50.185 --> 00:31:51.315
They slaughtered the bulls

607
00:31:51.315 --> 00:31:53.195
and they brought the child to Eli.

608
00:31:53.455 --> 00:31:55.875
And she said, oh my Lord, as you live my Lord,

609
00:31:55.955 --> 00:31:58.995
I am the woman who is standing here in your presence praying

610
00:31:59.015 --> 00:32:01.195
to the Lord for this child.

611
00:32:01.435 --> 00:32:04.995
I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my petition

612
00:32:05.305 --> 00:32:06.355
that I made to him.

613
00:32:06.905 --> 00:32:11.435
Therefore, I have lent him to the Lord as long

614
00:32:11.435 --> 00:32:13.395
as he lives, he is lent to the Lord

615
00:32:14.095 --> 00:32:16.395
and he worshiped the Lord there.

616
00:32:18.965 --> 00:32:23.745
So again, the point for Hannah was

617
00:32:23.745 --> 00:32:28.085
that her faith in God was so deep that

618
00:32:28.085 --> 00:32:30.485
that she was willing to take that three-year-old,

619
00:32:30.595 --> 00:32:32.005
cherished child

620
00:32:32.305 --> 00:32:35.445
and leave him in the tabernacle to serve the Lord forever.

621
00:32:40.485 --> 00:32:44.905
She knew this child was God's far more than he was hers.

622
00:32:47.895 --> 00:32:48.995
And you know why she knew that?

623
00:32:49.845 --> 00:32:52.615
Because she knew that she was God's too.

624
00:32:54.845 --> 00:32:57.635
God's got me. God's got my child. This is his child.

625
00:32:57.635 --> 00:33:02.235
This is not mine. I leave him here. She knew she was God's.

626
00:33:02.235 --> 00:33:03.675
Did you see five times?

627
00:33:03.855 --> 00:33:05.835
She referred to herself as a servant.

628
00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:11.565
She said, God, I'm yours. I am your servant. I am yours.

629
00:33:13.935 --> 00:33:16.715
Listen, that's what God is calling each of us to as well.

630
00:33:18.805 --> 00:33:23.105
He's calling each of us just like he provided for Israel.

631
00:33:23.325 --> 00:33:26.985
He heard and answered Hannah's prayer for a baby.

632
00:33:27.285 --> 00:33:30.385
And in that he called them all to faith in God.

633
00:33:31.585 --> 00:33:35.555
He's calling us to the same thing, to give the fullness

634
00:33:35.855 --> 00:33:38.915
of our response to this king of kings and Lord of lords.

635
00:33:40.555 --> 00:33:45.045
This is what he is calling us to give a full response to

636
00:33:45.075 --> 00:33:46.205
what he has done

637
00:33:47.975 --> 00:33:48.975
To who he is.

638
00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:51.545
I mean, just think about it. Let's

639
00:33:51.545 --> 00:33:52.625
play it out with Hannah for a second.

640
00:33:53.725 --> 00:33:55.585
She could have come to the tabernacle

641
00:33:56.165 --> 00:33:58.425
and taken this answered prayer.

642
00:33:58.595 --> 00:34:00.065
She's having him in a, uh,

643
00:34:00.065 --> 00:34:01.305
I don't know if they had strollers back then,

644
00:34:01.305 --> 00:34:04.655
but she was carrying the baby, bringing the,

645
00:34:04.975 --> 00:34:06.135
answered to this child.

646
00:34:06.215 --> 00:34:08.415
I prayed, right? She's bringing the answered prayer

647
00:34:08.635 --> 00:34:09.735
to the tabernacle,

648
00:34:09.875 --> 00:34:13.575
and she could have merely offered the bulls and the wine

649
00:34:13.795 --> 00:34:15.055
and the, the grain.

650
00:34:15.155 --> 00:34:17.815
She could have said, here it is, God, here it is.

651
00:34:18.675 --> 00:34:22.665
Here's the sacrifice I'm supposed to offer for this child.

652
00:34:22.725 --> 00:34:24.505
And she could have seen that as enough, right?

653
00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:28.365
But, but this is the child that you gave me.

654
00:34:28.545 --> 00:34:30.925
But I'm gonna give everything else away.

655
00:34:30.945 --> 00:34:32.485
But no, what'd she do?

656
00:34:34.725 --> 00:34:37.665
She gave the fulfillment of

657
00:34:37.665 --> 00:34:40.265
what she once saw was the deepest need in her life

658
00:34:44.845 --> 00:34:47.585
as the way that her shame was going to be removed.

659
00:34:48.125 --> 00:34:51.625
Her future was going to be secure by having a son.

660
00:34:52.045 --> 00:34:53.305
She gave even that,

661
00:34:56.775 --> 00:35:00.225
that was her true worship because it came from deep

662
00:35:00.685 --> 00:35:02.025
Inside her heart, right?

663
00:35:02.965 --> 00:35:05.225
It wasn't just the rituals, it wasn't just anything.

664
00:35:05.225 --> 00:35:09.385
But seeing God as her highest treasure

665
00:35:09.605 --> 00:35:11.105
and holding everything else loosely.

666
00:35:12.905 --> 00:35:13.525
That's worship.

667
00:35:18.355 --> 00:35:19.535
Is that where you are today?

668
00:35:23.575 --> 00:35:25.905
Like I've had to wrestle with this question myself all week.

669
00:35:28.725 --> 00:35:31.785
Is My response to God full

670
00:35:32.685 --> 00:35:34.785
and complete from my heart?

671
00:35:36.375 --> 00:35:40.165
Is yours Full and complete from your heart?

672
00:35:40.385 --> 00:35:43.685
Or as we look at Hannah, as we look at Israel,

673
00:35:43.705 --> 00:35:46.605
as we look at our lives, are you looking for security

674
00:35:46.945 --> 00:35:50.365
and stability and prosperity in all kinds of other things?

675
00:35:52.425 --> 00:35:55.365
Are, are you trying to cover your shame

676
00:35:55.585 --> 00:36:00.045
and your brokenness with having kids or getting married

677
00:36:00.145 --> 00:36:01.325
or having a lot of money

678
00:36:01.625 --> 00:36:05.485
or sexual, inter, all of those things, like whatever it is.

679
00:36:05.545 --> 00:36:06.645
Are you trying to cover up

680
00:36:06.675 --> 00:36:08.285
what you feel is your deepest need

681
00:36:08.285 --> 00:36:10.205
with all this stuff the world can offer?

682
00:36:10.225 --> 00:36:14.085
Here's the truth, our real shame, our real brokenness con,

683
00:36:14.225 --> 00:36:15.565
not from any of those things.

684
00:36:15.755 --> 00:36:17.405
They come from the fact that our relationship

685
00:36:17.405 --> 00:36:19.725
with God has been affected by our sin.

686
00:36:21.015 --> 00:36:24.235
That's why we feel lacking. That's why we feel deep inside.

687
00:36:24.425 --> 00:36:26.675
Some mistake has happened,

688
00:36:28.315 --> 00:36:29.615
but that's the beauty of the gospel,

689
00:36:32.415 --> 00:36:34.865
that Jesus was broken for us.

690
00:36:35.275 --> 00:36:38.545
Jesus took the penalty of our sin for us.

691
00:36:38.645 --> 00:36:42.265
He was forsaken for us, all of that so

692
00:36:42.265 --> 00:36:46.605
that we could be restored back to God and have the shame,

693
00:36:46.825 --> 00:36:49.605
and have the sin and the penalty and the wrath covered,

694
00:36:52.165 --> 00:36:53.795
Which Would never be covered by anything

695
00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:56.345
Else Other than a perfect

696
00:36:56.945 --> 00:36:57.945
Sacrifice.

697
00:36:58.905 --> 00:37:02.625
Therefore, Romans 12, one says,

698
00:37:03.135 --> 00:37:06.295
Just like we saw, therefore here in verse 28,

699
00:37:06.295 --> 00:37:10.745
therefore in view of God's mercy, in light

700
00:37:10.745 --> 00:37:13.705
of all that he has done for us in his grace

701
00:37:13.765 --> 00:37:17.865
and mercy, it says, offer your bodies.

702
00:37:18.115 --> 00:37:21.905
Offer yourselves as a living sacrifice,

703
00:37:22.655 --> 00:37:24.025
holy and pleasing to God.

704
00:37:24.455 --> 00:37:27.185
This is your spiritual act of worship.

705
00:37:29.475 --> 00:37:30.535
You see the parallel here,

706
00:37:33.335 --> 00:37:36.275
the deepest need you have ever been facing

707
00:37:37.335 --> 00:37:39.155
is not a lack here in this world.

708
00:37:39.175 --> 00:37:43.985
The deepest need is right here in your heart, in view

709
00:37:44.085 --> 00:37:45.185
of God's mercy

710
00:37:45.845 --> 00:37:46.845
And grace.

711
00:37:48.365 --> 00:37:53.125
Offer yourselves your whole selves as a living sacrifice,

712
00:37:54.265 --> 00:37:58.195
Holy by God, pleasing to him by his own work.

713
00:37:58.865 --> 00:38:01.275
This is your spiritual act of worship. That's what we're

714
00:38:01.275 --> 00:38:02.275
Talking about.

715
00:38:03.265 --> 00:38:04.525
That's what Israel's looking for.

716
00:38:04.525 --> 00:38:05.645
It's what Hannah was looking for.

717
00:38:05.875 --> 00:38:06.805
It's what we're looking for.
