1
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.380
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.980
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

3
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.580
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth

4
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.540
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

5
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.420
When Christ who is your life appears,

6
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.620
then you will also appear with him in glory.

7
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.340
Well, good morning again, church. It's always great to see you, to be together,

8
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.740
to worship like this. If you're new to our church, uh, my name's John.

9
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.380
I'm one of the pastors here. Uh,

10
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.340
we're honored that you would choose to be here with us today. Uh,

11
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.860
we'd love to get to know you and get to meet you somehow. Uh,

12
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.260
there's a QR code and one of the seat backs right in front of you.

13
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.100
Or you can grab one of those cards, fill it out,

14
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.940
take it to the new here area out there. We'd love to just bless you and help,

15
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.260
help you connect here if we can. Uh, we are thankful you're here.

16
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.420
We hope you are welcome, uh, and, and encouraged by your time with us.

17
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.250
We're continuing a series from the book of Colossians called Christ. Above All,

18
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.600
we've been talking about how Christ is superior to all worldly philosophies and

19
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.400
even superior to sin and temptation. As we get into this today,

20
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.200
though, what I want to tell you a little bit about is my experience with getting

21
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.720
completely off of social media About six months ago, all Facebook, Instagram,

22
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.120
Twitter, everything. I was completely off of that. And, and listen,

23
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.160
I don't share that with you to impress you. Uh, it is something,

24
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.720
or even that you should do that too. My my point in sharing that is that my, uh,

25
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.880
my experience has been kind of negative in that way.

26
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.840
I'm saying this as a negative illustration. In other words,

27
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.560
I'm sharing that because to my shame, uh, as I went off of social media,

28
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.360
my mind as I look at the last six months is much freer now, uh,

29
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.920
that it's less, uh, fomo, right? Fear of missing out.

30
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.440
Like I'm just wondering what am I not hearing about than I'm less focused on

31
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.320
what kids, uh, in, in your family are doing or less focused on,

32
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.240
uh, what perfect vacation you might have had or,

33
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.480
or how you're feeling about the President right now?

34
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.880
Like I'm less focused on all those things. My mind is freer.

35
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.920
But here's what that revealed.

36
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.960
It revealed that for so many years without realizing it,

37
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.600
my mind was,

38
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.760
was easily sucked into the things here on earth

39
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.880
rather than the things that are in heaven, eternal, good,

40
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.360
godly things. Now,

41
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.720
you might be feeling that in your life right now.

42
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.360
It may not be social media for you,

43
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.320
it might be Fox News or c n n depending on which you pick or,

44
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.280
or maybe it's fantasy football.

45
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.440
Maybe it's your kids' sports

46
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.750
or golfing or relationship or hunting or gaming or

47
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.270
a perfect wardrobe or, or whatever.

48
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.790
It could be literally anything else.

49
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.150
What we're looking for in all of those things is identity.

50
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.750
We're looking for an identity,

51
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.550
something to identify with that gives us worth or value or, or we feel affirmed.

52
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.230
And, and affirmation out of that something that makes us feel something. Even

53
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.330
that's why this truth today is so essential to remember that

54
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.450
your new and your true identity is from above,

55
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.730
not from here below.

56
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.070
This is not just for young people to hear today.

57
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.630
This is for all of us to hear that your true best new identity

58
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.150
comes from above, not from here below.

59
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.830
What really matters is found above in heaven, not here below.

60
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.350
And that's what we'll see in this critical transitional section here in the book

61
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.710
of Colossians as we begin chapter three now, as our journey goes through it.

62
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.120
So take your copy of God's Word and turn there with me.

63
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.640
Colossians three verses one through four is where we're gonna be today.

64
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.570
If you remember,

65
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.680
we've seen the apostle Paul has written this letter to the young church in

66
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.240
Colossae to remind them of a few things that Christ is above all the false

67
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.400
religious practices that were so prevalent around them.

68
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.200
And so they should not only trust Christ alone, they can trust Christ alone.

69
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.200
They don't have to drift back into any other religious practices or beliefs.

70
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.040
They don't need any of that because Christ has made them

71
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.760
spiritually alive. He's given them new life through his life,

72
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.000
death and resurrection. So he's enough,

73
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.570
the whole book of Colossians to remind them of that. Look how he now continues.

74
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.890
A bit of a transition here. Chapter three, verses one through four.

75
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.210
If then you have been raised with Christ, sounds familiar,

76
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.770
now that we've seen it on this, uh, intro video, all series, right? This is it.

77
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.730
If then you have been raised with Christ,

78
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.210
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated

79
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.440
at the right hand of God, set your minds on things that are above,

80
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.000
not on things that are on earth for you have died and

81
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.360
your life is hidden with Christ in God.

82
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.660
When Christ who is your life appears,

83
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.500
then you also will appear with him in glory.

84
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.870
God, help us see clearly what we've heard over and over in this intro video

85
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.550
of this whole series, this passage. God, that this is the crux of the matter.

86
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.990
Show us what you want us to see today. Open our hearts to be challenged,

87
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.630
confronted, changed as we need it.

88
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.950
May we be good soiled. May we be doers of the word, not just hearers only

89
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.190
do your work in us through your word. Give us a life according to your word God,

90
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.810
in Jesus' name. Amen. So again,

91
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.010
as we read through God's word,

92
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.730
whether you're doing it by yourself or we're doing it here,

93
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.090
we look for markers like transition words and commands.

94
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.650
Those are helping us understand what is important,

95
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.570
how things fit together in God's word.

96
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.770
And so there's a couple of 'em right here, right? You see in verse one, the,

97
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.410
then it shows us this sections dependent on what he has just said in the

98
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.930
previous few verses or chapters. And then in verse three,

99
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.290
there's a word four f o r.

100
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.570
It shows us that what he's saying there is the reason to do what he just said.

101
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.730
So he is giving us a lot of framework here for why we should do what

102
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.530
he's telling us to do here.

103
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.770
And so to get the Colossians there and to get us to those commands,

104
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.290
we'll see later he reminded them of four truths of salvation here.

105
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.650
That this short passage,

106
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.680
there's really four big bucket items of salvation. The truth's here.

107
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.320
And we're gonna see 'em very clearly. These are the reasons. What are they?

108
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.240
Well, here's the first one.

109
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.680
The first truth is that Christ was exalted to the throne.

110
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.120
Christ was exalted to the throne.

111
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.080
That's one of the main things we see right here. The end of verse one. It says,

112
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.280
what? Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

113
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.180
Now remember as we've walked through chapter one, especially into chapter two,

114
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.220
we realize and learned that Christ is God.

115
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.460
So how's he sitting in a sense next to God? Well, remember God is trinity.

116
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.100
God is three in one. And so, so technically,

117
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.740
if you're trying to get really detailed, the Father, God,

118
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.300
the Father is sitting on the throne. And God the Son is at his right hand.

119
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.020
Now, what's so important about the right hand? Why is that a big deal?

120
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.420
Is it because 90% of the population is right-handed? Sorry, lefties.

121
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.300
I know those scissors are really tough, but uh, you know what I mean, right?

122
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.300
Is that, is that why they're saying right hand? No.

123
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.620
The right hand of a dignitary signified honor

124
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.020
and authority.

125
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.600
This is actually referring to what is the most quoted Old Testament verse

126
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.320
in the New Testament. It's Psalm 110 Verse one.

127
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.880
David is pre luting the Messiah, looking forward. He says, the Lord,

128
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.560
that's Yahweh says to my Lord,

129
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.640
David's even referencing my Lord,

130
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.200
sit at my right hand till I make your enemies your footstool.

131
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.940
Every time that's used in the New Testament, it's talking about Jesus.

132
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.590
And so this is pointing to God the Father, God the Son, this whole uniqueness.

133
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.710
But it's about authority.

134
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.830
Now you remember where Jesus went after his resurrection after the 40 days of

135
00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:00.390
teaching with his disciples. In Acts one, it shows he did what?

136
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.670
He ascended back to heaven. Where did he go in heaven just to go hang out,

137
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.390
play golf with his buddies? No, he went to the right hand of the throne of God.

138
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.270
He went to this place of honor and authority to rule over

139
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.323
all things.

140
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.390
And so the Colossians needed to hear that again because all this other stuff was

141
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.350
trying to threaten God's authority.

142
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.190
That meant this meant that they didn't need to cater to these lesser

143
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.590
authorities, these lesser powers. They didn't need to try to,

144
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.550
to make them happy too. They just needed to focus on Christ alone.

145
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.530
'cause Christ is over them all. They needed to remember that.

146
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.410
We need to remember that. Listen, church, this God we serve.

147
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.050
He's not powerless. He's powerful.

148
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.260
This is who we serve. God is over all things.

149
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.080
And so we can trust him. Christ was exalted to the throne.

150
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.120
That's important.

151
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.750
Here's the second foundational truth of salvation.

152
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.930
Christians are dead to the world.

153
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.360
What

154
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.240
We see here, Christians are dead to the world.

155
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:15.940
Look again at verse three.

156
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.030
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

157
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.650
Now, this is not the first time we've seen this concept that Christians,

158
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.290
we have died in a sense to the world. We just saw it last week,

159
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.530
chapter two verse 20.

160
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.130
If or since with Christ, you died to the elemental spirits of the world.

161
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.010
Why are you as if you're still alive in the world? Do you submit to regulations?

162
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.140
Right? In other words, what he's saying is that when Christ died to the world,

163
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.180
in a sense, you Christian, you died with him to the world.

164
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.900
You are in his death in that way.

165
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.280
But think of, okay, so what do we mean by that?

166
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.450
What do we mean when this says the Christian has died to the world?

167
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.090
What does that mean?

168
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.090
Does that mean I could just not care anymore about anything?

169
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.170
I can just kind of go through my life and give up all my responsibilities?

170
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.810
Is that what dying to the world means? No.

171
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.960
What have you died to? What did it say?

172
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.080
You've died to the elemental spirits of the world that is

173
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.200
referencing those functional saviors that they were getting tempted by in

174
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.360
Colossae, the same functional saves that you and I set up in our daily lives.

175
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.470
We've died to that Romans seven, verse six,

176
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.750
you've died to the law that has held us captive. It says

177
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.920
Romans six, two even says You've died to sin. Praise the Lord.

178
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.600
This is what we mean when we say Christians are dead to the world.

179
00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.830
That it's no longer where we're trying to find salvation.

180
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.470
We're trying to find worth eternal value.

181
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.950
We don't need it here anymore.

182
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:11.030
And those Colossians needed to hear that because they were being tempted to

183
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.870
dilute the gospel and to spin off into all these other false

184
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.380
religions. Paul says, guys,

185
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.630
you're dead to all that. You don't need that.

186
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.260
Listen, we need to hear it today too 'cause, 'cause like I said, we,

187
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.460
we create functional saviors all the time in our own lives.

188
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.350
This is going to make me satisfied. This is gonna get me to heaven all. No, no,

189
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.110
we're dead to all of those things.

190
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.020
But the counter truth to that of course is that if you've died with Christ,

191
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.510
that means you are also raised with Christ.

192
00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:00.150
If you are in him and he's died, then if you're in him, he's also raised.

193
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.620
So you are raised with him. In fact,

194
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.940
that's what verse one says. I said this last week,

195
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.660
that word if at the beginning of verse one can actually be since,

196
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:17.620
because it's a condition assumed to be true, right? If you've been raised, no,

197
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.260
since you've been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above.

198
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.820
So this is assumed to be true,

199
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.980
that you have already been raised with Christ.

200
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.020
But then notice something else in verses three and four Again, see,

201
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.460
if you hear a repeated word in these two verses,

202
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.860
for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God,

203
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.460
when Christ who is your life appears,

204
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.740
then you also will appear with him in glory.

205
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.160
So I know Christ is repeated in there, but what else is repeated? Life?

206
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:58.750
Your life that's said over and over. So you died.

207
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.640
You died, but now you are alive in Him.

208
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:09.640
Your new life. It says it's hidden with Christ in God,

209
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.040
meaning it's secure, it's safe.

210
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.850
Not only that, verse four said something even further. It said,

211
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.530
Christ is your life.

212
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.310
So, so God's not up there just sustaining your physical life.

213
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.210
He also is your very spiritual life.

214
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.410
In other words too, the Colossians Paul is saying, Hey,

215
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:45.250
you don't need to to find identity in all these religious systems or behaviors.

216
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.210
You don't need to turn back to worthless, dead,

217
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.210
useless philosophies in the world to try to gain anything.

218
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.530
Why? Because you're alive in Christ. Now,

219
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.820
don't try to find life any other way.

220
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.300
You're already alive. You have life.

221
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:13.020
That life is in him. It's according to his word. Psalm 19 says,

222
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.060
and man, this is most likely,

223
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.900
the biggest problem our society has today,

224
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.100
is that we are looking for life everywhere.

225
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.080
And as hard as people try, as

226
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.330
much as we search out better pleasures,

227
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.010
better cars, bigger houses,

228
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.330
a new spouse, political victories, whatever it is,

229
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.850
it will not satisfy,

230
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.700
it will not give you life,

231
00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.990
and it will only cause you further heartache when you do put

232
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.350
your hope and your joy and your identity in all those kind of things.

233
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.710
Because here's what the enemy does. He takes all of those,

234
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.910
the the futility of all of those things, and he takes it all. And he,

235
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.470
he steals your joy with it. He kills your ability to find life with it.

236
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.830
He destroys your foundation with it.

237
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.680
That's what the enemy came. Jesus said it, John 10 10, the thief,

238
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.960
the enemy comes only to steal and kill and destroy.

239
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.660
And remember who's in charge of the worldly ways right now.

240
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.640
The enemy is the enemy is running. He's wreaking havoc. He's,

241
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.520
he's just wrecking everything as much as he can in the world around us.

242
00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.200
So why are we trying to find life in this stuff that he's doing that with

243
00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.640
Jesus? Didn't stop. The thief comes to steal, kill, and destroy.

244
00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.790
What else did he say? He says, but I have come. Jesus says,

245
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:04.750
I have come that they may have life and not just

246
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.340
any life.

247
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.960
Life abundantly abundant life.

248
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.860
That's what we're looking for, right? We're looking for abundant life.

249
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.420
We want this, this satisfying life.

250
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.100
We're looking for it in all of these wrong places.

251
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.740
Instead of looking for the one who is your life, Colossians three,

252
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.573
four says,

253
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.940
there's one more truth of salvation here in this passage.

254
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.940
It's in verse four.

255
00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.380
It's that Christ is returning to his kingdom.

256
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.140
Christ is returning to his kingdom. Look at it again. Verse four.

257
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.860
When Christ who is your life appears,

258
00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.910
then you also will appear with him in glory.

259
00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:57.270
Now,

260
00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:02.070
this is not making a statement in any kind about how or when Jesus will

261
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.590
physically bodily return. It's just saying that he will.

262
00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.230
It's saying that he will appear

263
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.710
Because in some way, the king is hidden right now, right?

264
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.930
The throne and the the son sitting at the father's right hand, he's, he's hid.

265
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.730
We can't see that he's, it's hidden for now,

266
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.610
but also think a layer deeper.

267
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.490
He's also hidden spiritually in a way where not everyone

268
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.650
acknowledges who he is as Lord and Savior.

269
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.250
They don't acknowledge that he is the king right now.

270
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:45.610
Yet this says all of that will one day be revealed when

271
00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:46.930
Jesus appears.

272
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:51.920
Yet notice something else

273
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.440
for those who find their life in Christ,

274
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.220
for those who are hidden with Christ in God, it says here,

275
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:06.870
they will appear with him in glory. Now,

276
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:11.680
what does that even mean? Well, part of it is that Jesus,

277
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.000
you can see one Thessalonians four, part of what it means is that Jesus,

278
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.400
when he returns,

279
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.880
he's bringing with him all of the believers who've died prior to that moment.

280
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.660
So we, if we're still alive, wouldn't be brought back.

281
00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.220
But all those who would be will appear with him in glory.

282
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.180
That's part of this.

283
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.900
Part of it is that the process of sanctification will finally be completed on

284
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.660
that day and we will appear. The word is glorified.

285
00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.460
Doesn't mean we get glory like Christ gets glory.

286
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.820
It means we are finally finished with this process of becoming like Jesus.

287
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.340
We're not there yet. That's sanctification making us holy.

288
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.900
One day we'll be finished and that's called glorification will be like

289
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.900
Jesus fully in that perfection sins.

290
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.260
So that's part of this as well. But here,

291
00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.940
here's another part that you might not catch on the surface.

292
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.210
Part of what will be revealed in glory, you might say,

293
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.890
is that the good that has been hidden in our lives for so long

294
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.810
will finally be revealed for what it is.

295
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.800
It will be honored when Christ appears.

296
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.910
Here's, here's what I mean.

297
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.060
That pure single life that you've chosen to live,

298
00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.260
that often gets laughed at by the world,

299
00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:54.010
it will be honored on that day and all will be made

300
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:59.090
clear that you found your hope and your joy and life in

301
00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.490
Christ over anything else here.

302
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:09.280
The fact that you have been and and not required to but chosen

303
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.253
to,

304
00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:15.240
to set aside so much of what the world can offer in life because you are

305
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.880
serving that special needs child that God gave you

306
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.980
that will be honored on the day Jesus appears.

307
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.190
Because you chose things that are above,

308
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.700
not things that are on earth, and the way you did it,

309
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.940
the way you journeyed that pathway,

310
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.890
the Lord will say, look, this is what is good.

311
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.660
The way you walk faithfully through cancer,

312
00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:53.270
the way you walk faithfully and and in a kind, gentle way,

313
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.790
when a business partner turns their back on you,

314
00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:58.803
it'll be honored.

315
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:04.220
It'll be shown to be what it is that you placed your hope and your life in

316
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.940
things above, not on things this earth can offer.

317
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:13.310
And on and on and on and on we could go.

318
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.990
Here's what Paul was saying to the Colossians. What he's saying to us is like,

319
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.470
Hey, it might seem like you're outnumbered.

320
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:24.190
It might seem like you're pushed aside for dying to the world and finding life

321
00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.910
in Christ. Just know the day is coming when all will be made right?

322
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:34.310
All will be shown to be what it is. All will be glory one day.

323
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:43.550
That's what second Corinthians four says so well verses

324
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:48.140
16 through 18. So we do not lose heart,

325
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.960
though our outer self is wasting away.

326
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.080
Our inner self is being renewed day by day

327
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.350
for this light,

328
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.630
momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight

329
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.390
of glory beyond all comparison as we look,

330
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.070
not to the things that are seen,

331
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.470
but to the things that are unseen for the things that are seen.

332
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.230
All the stuff in the world are transient, temporary,

333
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.390
but the things that are unseen are eternal.

334
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.340
So we don't lose heart

335
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:36.100
when you walk a road that's hard and that I've just described in some various

336
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.060
ways all over the,

337
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.100
and you're just being faithful and you think nobody sees you're getting cast off

338
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:47.060
by the world because of it. No, the day is coming. So don't lose heart.

339
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.950
That's in fact how the Colossians were to respond to these four truths.

340
00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.030
Okay? We've seen these truths. Paul's laid these truths out. Okay,

341
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.990
what do they do with that? How do we respond in our lives?

342
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.373
Well,

343
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.160
Let me read again all of these four verses and you'll see how it all fits

344
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.193
together. Now,

345
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.010
Since you have been raised with Christ,

346
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.890
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

347
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.810
Set your minds on things that are above,

348
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:29.650
not on things that are on earth because you have died and your life is hidden

349
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.650
with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears,

350
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.930
then you also will appear with him in glory.

351
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.280
And so he's saying, guys,

352
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.840
what are you to do now with this new identity that you have?

353
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.280
What are you to do now with the fact that you've been raised with Christ?

354
00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.960
What do you do with that? First,

355
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.760
keep looking for the kingdom of God.

356
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.060
Keep looking for it for this kingdom

357
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.300
since you've been raised with Christ,

358
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.860
since you already in God, spiritually in Christ.

359
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.500
Seek the things that are above

360
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.400
like you're ultimately looking for Christ. You're looking for His kingdom.

361
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.160
And remember where Christ is, where is Christ? He is above.

362
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.400
He's seated at the right hand of the Father on heavens throne.

363
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.160
And so he's saying, you are to seek those heavenly things.

364
00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.320
Seek the things that are true of Christ.

365
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:38.080
That word to seek means keep on desiring to

366
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.800
possess it. Now look for it.

367
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:48.480
Look for the ways God is working in this world already

368
00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:53.720
and keep working for the ways he would show up through your life on a

369
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.580
daily basis. It's not just sitting back and kinda watching.

370
00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.940
It's actually participating to see it now,

371
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.290
to desire to possess it now because

372
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.330
he's already the king. We are already a part of his kingdom.

373
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.570
We already have a new set of values.

374
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:17.010
We are to live those things out here today on this earth.

375
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.760
'cause our true citizen here, listen, our true citizenship is not here.

376
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.180
It's hidden with Christ in God there.

377
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.410
That's our true home.

378
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.190
I read this illustration this week. So imagine,

379
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:41.270
imagine you're getting ready to move to Japan next month,

380
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.360
and so you've got all the, the itinerary, the flights, everything you're,

381
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.200
you're gonna move to Japan in a couple weeks.

382
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.840
You would naturally set your mind on the things of Japan,

383
00:28:55.850 --> 00:29:00.820
right? Like you'd start now going ahead to start learning how to eat sushi.

384
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.780
You would figure out how to begin learning the language.

385
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.660
You might even learn how to do sumo wrestling. I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.

386
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.270
But you, you figure out how to live like think. Think of this.

387
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:17.470
You would seek to live today the way you know you're about to live permanently.

388
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.510
Is that not what we're talking about here? If that's home,

389
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.710
if that's permanent, that's what this is saying.

390
00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.750
Even the midst of darkness. In the midst of the hard ships of life,

391
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.770
since we're hidden with Christ and God,

392
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:42.600
since we are already there in a sense with him,

393
00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.720
we are to do what Colossians two six said a couple weeks ago. Therefore,

394
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.840
as you received Christ, Jesus the Lord. So walk in him.

395
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.800
You already have him. You are already there. He's already yours.

396
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.760
You already his. And so walk it out, live it out.

397
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:09.430
Here's the reality though. You know it's true. Every study says it's true.

398
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.350
Sadly, many Christians

399
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.690
live no differently than the world we live in right here.

400
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.420
No substantial statistical difference between the way Christians live their

401
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:29.180
lives here versus unbelievers all around us.

402
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:37.530
This is what we're supposed to be. Citizens of heaven. New value,

403
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:42.440
new kingdom people. Well, here's the good news.

404
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.100
The rest of Colossians will show us what that looks like.

405
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.140
What does a new kingdom life look like?

406
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.750
It'll help us grasp what it should look like for us as

407
00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:04.000
believers. But here's the truth.

408
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.640
You can only look for and you can only work for the

409
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.240
kingdom of God coming here as Jesus prayed in Matthew five.

410
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.040
You can only do all that first if you are thinking about the kingdom of God.

411
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.750
It's one thing to say, all right, go live it, work it.

412
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.700
You gotta think about it first. And that's verse two.

413
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.780
That's that's my illustration I started with about the way my mind was stolen

414
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:35.580
away to social media and all these things like that's what we're talking about

415
00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.620
here. It's verse two,

416
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.300
set your minds on things that are above,

417
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.300
not on things that are on earth.

418
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:50.950
Like there's no explanation needed that is just straight up clear.

419
00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.480
But listen, think about that.

420
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.360
If our Lord and Savior is there,

421
00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.400
if our life is there,

422
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.070
and if we have died to all the things here,

423
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.500
then why would we prioritize anything but him?

424
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:26.860
Anything but that he's there. Our life is there. He is our,

425
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:31.180
why would we prioritize all the things we have died to?

426
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.300
The Colossians,

427
00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.300
they were tempted to think about all this religious noise that kept coming their

428
00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.120
way, the sin options that were all over colossae that, so Paul,

429
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.960
what did he say? He said, give careful attention.

430
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.760
Give full focus to the things that are above,

431
00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.600
not to these things.

432
00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.280
'cause he knew that would keep them from getting sucked away to all of that

433
00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.240
stuff. The falsehoods, everything sinful.

434
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.520
It's the same battle for us today, church.

435
00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.840
And actually in some ways it's even harder for us

436
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:18.780
when you think about the pervasiveness of our phones,

437
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.420
computers, tv,

438
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.820
all the noise that we choose to allow into our lives just

439
00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.900
constantly bombarding us.

440
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.980
And it is much harder to think about the kingdom of God,

441
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.620
to think about things that are above when we're constantly thinking about all of

442
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.573
these other things.

443
00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.990
Your brain can only think about one thing at one time. No, I can multitask. No,

444
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.550
you're task switching really quickly.

445
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.580
You can only think about one thing at one time.

446
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.660
And so if we're constantly thinking about all of these other things,

447
00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.060
we're not thinking about the kingdom of God, the things that are above.

448
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.680
And remember, where's your new identity? It's above, not below.

449
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.570
And yet we make it so much harder on ourselves to

450
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:16.170
remember what that true identity actually is

451
00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.030
when you're sitting there constantly comparing yourself, your body, whatever,

452
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.670
to that influencer on TikTok,

453
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.520
when you're immersed

454
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.570
nonstop into this political spin cycle that we live in,

455
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:46.710
when you spend 10 times the amount of time on

456
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.830
stat sheets for your fantasy team than you do in the word of God,

457
00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.430
when you're spending hours searching through house listings to find that perfect

458
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.263
neighborhood.

459
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.900
Now listen, I don't want us to go back.

460
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.700
We talked about this last week about going back to these manmade rules

461
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.713
and regulation.

462
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.100
'cause I could sit up here and I could just start firing stuff off at you. Now,

463
00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.020
this is what you need to do. You need to get rid of this, right?

464
00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.580
You need to bury your tv. Remember that one. You need to get rid of your phone,

465
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.300
get off of social media. Like I could sit here and impose these things on you.

466
00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.660
Absolutely. But listen, that's cutting away branches. Remember?

467
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.770
But here, listen, I do think

468
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.880
that you need to ask the Lord for wisdom on this in your life.

469
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.680
I, I can't impose something on you. Nobody should.

470
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.440
But you need to ask the Lord for wisdom here,

471
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.920
and you need to ask him to expose your heart where you are.

472
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.840
Treasuring things here

473
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:57.340
that you might need to remove or might need to limit in your life.

474
00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.320
Do you need to make some hard decisions

475
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.360
so that you can better set your mind on things that are above,

476
00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.240
not on things that are on earth,

477
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:17.200
so that you can get to the root of the sin easier so you can

478
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:22.120
let God change you easier? Do you need to make some hard decisions?

479
00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:28.150
Ask the Lord for that 'cause.

480
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.510
Psalm 1914, praise.

481
00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:35.910
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be

482
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.110
acceptable in your sight. Oh Lord, my rock, my redeemer.

483
00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:46.200
What's the meditation of your heart? That's the things you are thinking about.

484
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.480
What kind of things should you think about? Philippians four, eight says,

485
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.440
finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable,

486
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.840
whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable,

487
00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:03.080
if there's any excellence, if there's anything worthy of praise,

488
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:05.120
think about these things.

489
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.520
Set your mind on these

490
00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.013
Things.

491
00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.120
One more thing to remember today, though

492
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:20.833
I,

493
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.260
We've talked a lot about things on heaven, things in heaven, things on earth.

494
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.700
You know what else is on earth?

495
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.450
You know what else is something that you have died to. If you are in Christ

496
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:38.943
Your sin,

497
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.030
Romans six, you have died to your

498
00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:45.483
Sin.

499
00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.710
Hear me? The enemy loves to keep bringing it up,

500
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.870
to bring you down.

501
00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:57.030
He loves tossing it back in your mind,

502
00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:01.230
to keep you ineffective in living out this new kingdom kind of life,

503
00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.190
this heavenly focused kind of life. But do not forget, this is the gospel.

504
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:11.390
Do not forget that Christ has already defeated that record of debt that's

505
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.830
against you because you didn't do it right. You didn't obey the law. It's gone,

506
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.910
it's defeated it. The death of Christ,

507
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:22.070
who then also made you alive together with him.

508
00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.350
He's forgiven you of all of that.

509
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:30.150
You are dead to that sin. You in Christ,

510
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:34.870
you've died to all of that. You've been raised with Christ. Your life is hidden,

511
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.960
safely, securely in God.

512
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:44.370
So how do you respond? That's what Romans six continues with,

513
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:48.450
verses 11 through 13. So you also must consider mean.

514
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.930
You must choose to believe it,

515
00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:54.330
that you are dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.

516
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.970
Remind yourself, keep telling yourself then let not sin. Therefore,

517
00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:04.170
reign in your mortal body to make you obey its passions.

518
00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:08.810
Don't present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness,

519
00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:14.010
but present yourselves to God as those who've been brought from death to

520
00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:18.630
life. Don't give yourself to sin anymore.

521
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:20.830
You're dead to it. You are alive to God.

522
00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:24.670
So give yourself to God that he can use it for righteousness sake.

523
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:32.380
Stop letting the shame of your past, the sin,

524
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.540
the temptation that the enemy tosses your way.

525
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:40.220
Stop letting it all derail you from following Christ. You're dead to it all now.

526
00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:45.560
It's like that snake, you cut its head off,

527
00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.720
it still thrashes around for a while. That's your sin. That's the enemy.

528
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:50.920
He's that defeated,

529
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:55.600
but he's still fighting and he's trying to what? Steal,

530
00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.320
kill, and destroy everything in your life.

531
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.720
He's dead. You're dead to it.

532
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:11.070
So stop focusing on it. Stop thinking about it. Stop setting your mind on it.

533
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:15.550
Here's what an old pastor once said, he said, for every one, look at yourself.

534
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:20.310
Take 10 looks at Christ. You've gotta know,

535
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:23.470
you've gotta acknowledge, yes, I'm a sinner. Yes, I blew that one.

536
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:27.470
But set your mind on things that are above. Take 10 looks at Christ.

537
00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.750
Look back to the gospel. Don't forget who he is and what he's done.

538
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.300
The more you do that,

539
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:40.910
the more you remember what he says over what the world says.

540
00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.190
That's where your identity is secure in him.

541
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.970
It's where you're not worried about what everybody else is doing,

542
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.330
what things are happening around you. You are secure in him,

543
00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:58.170
and that's how you more consistently live out Christ's new

544
00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.530
kingdom principles here on earth.

545
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.280
Set your mind on things that are above.

546
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:09.230
Seek the things that are above where your

547
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.550
life is.
