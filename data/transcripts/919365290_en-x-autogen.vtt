WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:01.165
Okay.

2
00:00:01.805 --> 00:00:04.365
I wanna be very respectful of that if there is.

3
00:00:05.345 --> 00:00:08.925
So, last week we talked about a really important part

4
00:00:09.265 --> 00:00:13.165
of this, uh, growing towards deeper

5
00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:15.965
intimacy in our relationships as couples,

6
00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:18.365
and even with our kids and others.

7
00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.685
Uh, being able to really, uh, communicate heart to heart

8
00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:26.285
and keep a safe place for people to do that with us,

9
00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:30.285
where they don't feel worried about how will you react

10
00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:32.885
if I tell you I feel inadequate,

11
00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:37.125
or, uh, anything like that.

12
00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:40.005
We, we learned how to really tune in and,

13
00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:43.205
and help people feel good and safe about that.

14
00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:49.045
Um, but we were, we did not reserve enough time

15
00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.205
to let you do the experiential, the exercise

16
00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:54.685
that is actually part of that lesson.

17
00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:59.325
And so, I, I'm gonna let you have a few moments to do

18
00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.925
that tonight as we, pretty much, as we get started.

19
00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:05.125
I'm gonna show a video first of Dr. Ferguson, um,

20
00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:08.765
which is more about our experiencing a

21
00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:09.965
deeper love with the Lord.

22
00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.045
And I love some of these meditations that he does,

23
00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:15.965
and, uh, just think it'll be a great way,

24
00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:17.765
almost like praying a little longer.

25
00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:22.525
But, um, what he's talking about in here is

26
00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:27.725
a promise that can be seen in scripture of

27
00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:30.125
how the Lord will pursue you with his love.

28
00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:33.925
Mm-Hmm. Even if you're not pursuing

29
00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:35.325
him, he's pursuing you.

30
00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:39.325
And there've been many times when I've

31
00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:40.485
needed him to pursue me.

32
00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:43.965
So, uh, he's gonna reference John nine

33
00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:47.565
and one that I mentioned last week is, uh,

34
00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:51.365
the familiar passage, Psalm 23.

35
00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:57.085
And in verse six, it says, he will follow you all the days

36
00:01:57.105 --> 00:02:00.285
of your life with his mercy and his love.

37
00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:04.445
He's following you. Now, sometimes I have

38
00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:06.045
to slow down enough to let him catch me.

39
00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:08.565
Does that make sense? I'm off doing my own thing,

40
00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:12.525
but he's following us and pursuing us with his life.

41
00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:16.325
So let's just, uh, have a listen here with, uh, David

42
00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:20.535
and, uh, this,

43
00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:23.615
all these clips are no more than four minutes.

44
00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:24.855
Most of them are about three.

45
00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.495
In the gospels is the man born blind.

46
00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:31.015
In John chapter nine, this unnamed man

47
00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:33.095
gets a whole chapter.

48
00:02:34.635 --> 00:02:37.655
And in that chapter, it's filled with insights, uh,

49
00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:40.175
that apply to each of our, uh, personal lives,

50
00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:43.415
our marriage journey, because this man endures

51
00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:46.055
disappointments and pain, sorrows and grief.

52
00:02:46.405 --> 00:02:49.855
This man experiences the pain of life events.

53
00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:52.975
He was born blind, or we, we would say today stuff happens.

54
00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:55.815
Each of us in our marriage journey is going

55
00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:57.455
to have the pain of life events.

56
00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:00.805
He also has the experience of disappointing, uh,

57
00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:02.765
relationships, even with his own family,

58
00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:05.725
is they're not quite sure how he got healed

59
00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:07.885
or anything about Jesus, not the most, uh,

60
00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:09.365
supportive folks on the planet.

61
00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:12.805
So in life's journey, we're gonna have those life events,

62
00:03:12.855 --> 00:03:14.125
those disappointing relationships.

63
00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:17.765
And even for many of us, a certain irrelevant religion.

64
00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:20.525
The, uh, Jewish leaders don't rejoice with him

65
00:03:20.525 --> 00:03:21.765
after Jesus heals him.

66
00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:23.885
All of us have experienced the pain of

67
00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.005
what we might call irrelevant religion, things

68
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.765
that don't really matter, making big deals out of stuff

69
00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:29.845
that's insignificant.

70
00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:32.005
Because in any of those situations,

71
00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:35.045
those painful life events, in any of those situations,

72
00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:37.965
the key question is not a rational why question.

73
00:03:38.035 --> 00:03:41.405
It's a relational question, does God care?

74
00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:44.845
Because the beauty of the John nine story is it says,

75
00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:47.925
after all, the pain of, of the relational disappointments,

76
00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:49.645
the irrelevant religion, the whole issue

77
00:03:49.645 --> 00:03:52.365
of his being born blind, the Bible says they get

78
00:03:52.425 --> 00:03:56.285
so frustrated with him in the, in the Jewish, uh, synagogue,

79
00:03:56.285 --> 00:03:59.965
that they put him out, they excommunicated him, if you will,

80
00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:01.685
from the life of the religious community.

81
00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:03.645
And here's the most important verse

82
00:04:03.915 --> 00:04:05.565
that I want us to focus on in a minute.

83
00:04:05.565 --> 00:04:07.405
It says, when Jesus heard,

84
00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:10.525
When Jesus heard,

85
00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:14.165
does Jesus still hear today about your disappointments,

86
00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:17.325
your pain, your sorrow, your sadness, your rejections?

87
00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:21.445
Of course he does. When Jesus heard it,

88
00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:24.005
He went and found you.

89
00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:27.205
He's not distant from you. He's not ignoring you.

90
00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:29.365
He's not so busy. He can't focus on you.

91
00:04:30.115 --> 00:04:32.285
He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

92
00:04:32.775 --> 00:04:34.445
Would you bow with me for just a moment?

93
00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:37.805
And we're gonna meditate upon this beautiful passage

94
00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:41.285
of Jesus hearing and coming to find us.

95
00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:45.085
Thank you, father. Thank you, father, that we have a Christ

96
00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:47.125
who knows all things.

97
00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:50.445
Whatever those challenges and struggles in your life are

98
00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:53.965
right now, would you just imagine, however you imagine

99
00:04:54.025 --> 00:04:57.485
and picture Jesus, he hears of them,

100
00:04:58.155 --> 00:05:00.005
embrace the truth of the scriptures.

101
00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:03.885
That when Jesus hears, he comes and finds you.

102
00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:07.685
Would you just imagine now that Christ pursues you

103
00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:09.885
in the midst of knowing you,

104
00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:13.725
and then he wants to reveal himself to you?

105
00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:18.405
Just maybe whisper the prayer of young Samuel speak,

106
00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:19.565
Lord, I'm listening.

107
00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:24.925
What might this pursuing Jesus want to reveal to you

108
00:05:26.095 --> 00:05:28.885
about your circumstances, about your struggle, about your,

109
00:05:28.905 --> 00:05:31.325
so first, listen to his voice

110
00:05:31.985 --> 00:05:34.885
and hear what he wants to say just for you.

111
00:05:35.825 --> 00:05:38.325
And after you've heard from him, respond back

112
00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:39.325
to him in a personal way.

113
00:05:39.835 --> 00:05:41.725
Tell Jesus what's on your heart.

114
00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:10.205
Thank you, father, that we have the privilege

115
00:06:11.025 --> 00:06:12.605
to celebrate your pursuing us.

116
00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:15.445
And we have the wonder that you are a God

117
00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:18.845
who reveals himself in Jesus' name.

118
00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:20.395
Amen.

119
00:06:30.715 --> 00:06:32.175
Now, this will probably start playing,

120
00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:34.575
Get the whole check.

121
00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:39.855
So I'm going to use another one later,

122
00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:41.255
so I don't want to kill that.

123
00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:50.985
Okay. How's this going? Is this all making sense?

124
00:06:51.015 --> 00:06:52.785
What we're talking about, what you're reading about?

125
00:06:55.925 --> 00:06:57.705
Uh, I think I might've said

126
00:06:57.705 --> 00:07:02.545
before that, um, I'm, I've been, uh,

127
00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:05.465
reading these materials that have been produced,

128
00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:07.465
uh, through Dr.

129
00:07:07.575 --> 00:07:10.905
David's Ferguson's ministry for about 30 years now.

130
00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:13.625
And, uh, Uh,

131
00:07:13.775 --> 00:07:16.425
this one just came out about two or three years ago.

132
00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:19.345
And I, and I really think it's probably the best

133
00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:20.585
package of material.

134
00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:24.105
And as you might've even read this week, um,

135
00:07:24.405 --> 00:07:27.345
you'll see these vignettes that are kind of interspersed

136
00:07:27.345 --> 00:07:31.665
through there of this couple named Steve and Barbara Ulman.

137
00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:34.225
They really share vulnerably,

138
00:07:34.775 --> 00:07:36.305
very vulnerably from their lives.

139
00:07:37.245 --> 00:07:38.625
And I always appreciate that

140
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.705
because I just feel like, well, I can trust people

141
00:07:40.845 --> 00:07:42.465
who are being transparent like that.

142
00:07:43.285 --> 00:07:45.865
Uh, I can probably learn from them.

143
00:07:46.725 --> 00:07:47.985
So that's one thing

144
00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:50.105
that we have really appreciated about this.

145
00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:55.905
Um, but we hope that, that you're finding

146
00:07:56.135 --> 00:07:58.745
that, um, you're actually coming

147
00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:03.145
to know your spouse more deeply, even as you go through some

148
00:08:03.145 --> 00:08:04.145
of these times of sharing.

149
00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:09.385
Okay? So I want

150
00:08:09.465 --> 00:08:12.705
to give you this opportunity for just a few minutes

151
00:08:13.405 --> 00:08:17.025
and, uh, uh, I think I'll try to play some music

152
00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:18.305
or something while we're doing this.

153
00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:21.345
But I want you to just practice one thing we

154
00:08:21.345 --> 00:08:22.385
talked about last week.

155
00:08:22.445 --> 00:08:23.505
You may have already done this,

156
00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:27.665
but last week when we started, I had you share something

157
00:08:28.345 --> 00:08:29.785
positive that would've

158
00:08:30.465 --> 00:08:31.585
happened for you during your childhood.

159
00:08:31.725 --> 00:08:32.945
And I focused on hobbies,

160
00:08:33.525 --> 00:08:36.345
and I suggested that you take turns sharing what was a hobby

161
00:08:36.345 --> 00:08:38.745
that brought you joy when you were a kid.

162
00:08:39.365 --> 00:08:41.865
And I mentioned my model building model airplanes

163
00:08:41.885 --> 00:08:44.625
and how that brought me a lot of fun, a lot of joy.

164
00:08:45.165 --> 00:08:46.265
And I'm kind of a nerd

165
00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:48.865
and kind of a by yourself kind of guy.

166
00:08:48.925 --> 00:08:51.745
So I, I like doing those kinds of things by myself,

167
00:08:52.485 --> 00:08:55.605
but also, uh, doing them with, uh, my son is, he got

168
00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:56.725
to be old enough to do that.

169
00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.925
But tonight I want you to practice the other half

170
00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:02.525
of Romans 1215.

171
00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:04.645
It's Romans 1215 B.

172
00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:09.285
It's the backside of the rejoice with those rejoice.

173
00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:12.365
It's weep with those who weep or mourn with those who mourn.

174
00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:17.325
Now, I'm not suggesting that you try to process everything

175
00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:19.405
negative that happened in your childhood

176
00:09:20.105 --> 00:09:23.125
or even this past week, but just pick something.

177
00:09:23.745 --> 00:09:26.325
And it's fine if it's from your childhood, honestly.

178
00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:29.125
Uh, a lot of people say, well, why do you do that?

179
00:09:29.145 --> 00:09:32.245
And I say, because if it didn't get healed for you,

180
00:09:32.435 --> 00:09:34.285
then guess what?

181
00:09:34.515 --> 00:09:35.685
It's still in your brain.

182
00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:40.085
And it still could be looking for some healing.

183
00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:43.485
And I think God likes to circle the wagons, come back around

184
00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:45.525
and say, Hey, Bruce, you got one

185
00:09:45.525 --> 00:09:46.685
from when you were about 12.

186
00:09:46.735 --> 00:09:48.485
Let's work on that one. Okay?

187
00:09:48.985 --> 00:09:50.525
And by the way, I've already equipped

188
00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:51.965
Joyce and her heart's ready.

189
00:09:52.015 --> 00:09:55.405
She's gonna help. Okay? That makes it a lot different.

190
00:09:55.905 --> 00:09:58.165
So what I want you to do is just take turns sharing

191
00:09:58.675 --> 00:10:02.645
something, and even just a few sentences of,

192
00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:05.845
here's something that I remember that was kind of sad

193
00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:07.085
for me or hurtful to me.

194
00:10:07.465 --> 00:10:11.485
It could be anything from a pet that, that gets, uh,

195
00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:15.045
too old and you have to put it down or got run over.

196
00:10:15.785 --> 00:10:20.045
It could be your best friend moving away or you moving away.

197
00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:24.405
Uh, it could be something that you really wanted

198
00:10:24.465 --> 00:10:26.325
and counted on and it didn't happen.

199
00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:29.645
Uh, or it could be, uh,

200
00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:31.045
things like parents divorcing

201
00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:33.045
or things like that. But just take turns

202
00:10:33.565 --> 00:10:35.965
Previously shared a little bit about the importance of,

203
00:10:36.425 --> 00:10:37.605
uh, being a 10.

204
00:10:38.545 --> 00:10:40.605
Did I mention that I do not have a good

205
00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:41.885
relationship with technology?

206
00:10:44.215 --> 00:10:47.565
There we go again. So there's probably something

207
00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:48.645
on here I need to kill.

208
00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:52.565
Uh, it was that. Okay, thanks.

209
00:10:54.225 --> 00:10:58.405
Um, whatever, whatever comes

210
00:10:58.405 --> 00:11:00.445
to your mind, just take turns sharing.

211
00:11:00.565 --> 00:11:01.845
I remember a time when,

212
00:11:03.185 --> 00:11:06.205
or a weigh that something happened

213
00:11:07.185 --> 00:11:08.645
and your spouse is gonna be looking

214
00:11:09.505 --> 00:11:10.845
eye, eye to eye with you.

215
00:11:12.385 --> 00:11:15.645
And I encourage spouses, a couple of ground rules here.

216
00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:17.405
Don't ask a lot of questions.

217
00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:21.485
If anything, listen to what they share voluntarily

218
00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:27.365
express care, and then say, is there more?

219
00:11:28.585 --> 00:11:32.645
Is there more? And if they already feel like, no,

220
00:11:32.765 --> 00:11:35.565
I think I've shared what that was about,

221
00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:39.085
and thank you for caring, appreciate that.

222
00:11:40.665 --> 00:11:44.645
And that's really what that verse mourn with those who mourn

223
00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:47.325
really can look like.

224
00:11:48.385 --> 00:11:50.725
Now, it could also look like going to someone's funeral

225
00:11:51.505 --> 00:11:53.565
and spending a lot of time looking at

226
00:11:53.695 --> 00:11:55.205
everything that's about that.

227
00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:58.685
But you know, most of these disappointments in life happen

228
00:11:59.825 --> 00:12:01.245
as we go through life, right?

229
00:12:01.265 --> 00:12:05.325
Mm-Hmm. And I don't know about you that I rarely

230
00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:09.545
have an empty hour with nothing to do.

231
00:12:10.645 --> 00:12:14.985
In fact, I think I was 18 when that was last, the case.

232
00:12:16.085 --> 00:12:19.145
Uh, and we go through them in life.

233
00:12:19.565 --> 00:12:23.225
And, you know, it makes a huge difference when you are

234
00:12:23.505 --> 00:12:25.465
reminded that somebody really does care.

235
00:12:25.615 --> 00:12:29.625
Even if they can't fix it, that's actually what, not

236
00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:31.345
what we're commanded to do.

237
00:12:31.345 --> 00:12:33.865
It doesn't say if one of you is hurting, fix it.

238
00:12:34.715 --> 00:12:37.495
It says, if one of you of you is hurting, hurt with them.

239
00:12:38.835 --> 00:12:40.215
But we're not real good at that.

240
00:12:40.935 --> 00:12:45.025
Normally, that's not what our culture tends to say.

241
00:12:46.615 --> 00:12:49.555
We try to remove people

242
00:12:49.815 --> 00:12:52.235
or rescue them from feeling anything.

243
00:12:55.895 --> 00:12:59.155
So I just had an a sports moment,

244
00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:01.075
and I'm not going to say it.

245
00:13:01.265 --> 00:13:04.955
Okay? It would probably upset half the people in the room.

246
00:13:05.095 --> 00:13:08.635
So, so anyway, we're gonna do that for just a few minutes

247
00:13:09.175 --> 00:13:10.875
and I'll kind of be able to observe

248
00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:12.875
and kind of see when most people are done.

249
00:13:12.935 --> 00:13:15.155
If you're done, just sit back in your

250
00:13:15.155 --> 00:13:17.395
chair and we'll do that.

251
00:13:17.545 --> 00:13:19.355
Okay? So take turns sharing.

252
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:23.435
I remember a time when, and your spouse is to listen

253
00:13:23.775 --> 00:13:26.755
and offer an expression of compassion.

254
00:13:28.455 --> 00:13:30.355
I'm hurting for you because you went through

255
00:13:30.355 --> 00:13:32.195
that, something like that.

256
00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:33.195
Right?

257
00:14:00.575 --> 00:14:05.435
It just caught me by just

258
00:14:14.465 --> 00:14:15.555
teacher that I had

259
00:14:23.425 --> 00:14:23.915
went back

260
00:14:42.295 --> 00:14:43.195
and recover.

261
00:14:44.155 --> 00:14:48.235
Although there I did better than others.

262
00:15:03.845 --> 00:15:04.365
I had,

263
00:16:31.685 --> 00:16:34.245
I know he hates to see me cry.

264
00:18:47.395 --> 00:18:48.605
Okay? Another minute or two.

265
00:19:41.385 --> 00:19:44.965
You ever heard the song? You ever heard the song?

266
00:19:44.965 --> 00:19:47.165
You say, I am loved? Yeah.

267
00:19:49.065 --> 00:19:51.645
Is that Lauren? Mm-Hmm. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

268
00:19:51.985 --> 00:19:56.245
In fact, I was gonna look for that. And JJ Heller came by.

269
00:19:56.435 --> 00:19:59.165
Yeah, actually, it is what went through my head.

270
00:19:59.475 --> 00:20:01.565
Yeah. That was what was on my mind. Yeah.

271
00:20:30.945 --> 00:20:32.125
So I didn't, anybody there.

272
00:20:43.665 --> 00:20:46.125
Now, some may still be finishing up and that's okay.

273
00:20:46.305 --> 00:20:47.605
I'm not cutting you off,

274
00:20:48.505 --> 00:20:50.965
but I want everybody who is done to notice,

275
00:20:51.075 --> 00:20:55.925
what are you feeling in turn inside right now?

276
00:20:58.875 --> 00:21:03.275
What are you feeling, Gary?

277
00:21:03.335 --> 00:21:04.355
I'm looking right at you, but

278
00:21:05.645 --> 00:21:06.915
don't want to put you on the spot.

279
00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:08.355
No, but I just

280
00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:09.375
Did. I thought that was rhetorical.

281
00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:11.475
So

282
00:21:11.475 --> 00:21:13.555
what she shared is something we actually experienced

283
00:21:13.715 --> 00:21:15.035
together, which was the loss of a pet.

284
00:21:15.265 --> 00:21:18.355
Okay. That, that affected her a lot more than

285
00:21:18.355 --> 00:21:19.395
it affected me,

286
00:21:19.485 --> 00:21:20.485
Uhhuh. And so

287
00:21:20.485 --> 00:21:22.955
I, I kind of feel a little bit my own hurt,

288
00:21:23.025 --> 00:21:25.355
obviously hurt with her.

289
00:21:26.465 --> 00:21:28.315
Okay. Yeah. So it's her.

290
00:21:28.865 --> 00:21:30.715
Okay. It's her, her's, my husband.

291
00:21:31.535 --> 00:21:34.755
But you kind of, even though you were there, you kind

292
00:21:34.755 --> 00:21:37.595
of entered that space with her, if you will, right?

293
00:21:37.595 --> 00:21:39.395
Mm-Hmm. How'd that feel to you?

294
00:21:40.225 --> 00:21:44.395
Yeah. Well, I was, I mean, I had this much of my own hurt,

295
00:21:44.415 --> 00:21:45.875
but I felt her hurt. Yeah.

296
00:21:46.385 --> 00:21:47.675
Because She was tearing up.

297
00:21:47.675 --> 00:21:49.395
And that that also contributes to

298
00:21:49.415 --> 00:21:50.415
You. Yeah. It makes a

299
00:21:50.415 --> 00:21:50.955
difference. Doesn't,

300
00:21:51.105 --> 00:21:52.105
Yeah.

301
00:21:52.295 --> 00:21:54.435
So I'm not to put you on the spot, Terry, but

302
00:21:55.095 --> 00:21:59.035
but how did it feel when he was kind of there with you?

303
00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:06.095
Um, I think about this.

304
00:22:16.095 --> 00:22:18.095
I mean, I probably been on the floor for half an hour

305
00:22:18.095 --> 00:22:21.335
with her because I was just, she was my

306
00:22:22.575 --> 00:22:24.655
constant complain for over 15 years.

307
00:22:25.115 --> 00:22:27.455
Wow. Even when he was deployed, she was

308
00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:29.035
That's right.

309
00:22:29.275 --> 00:22:30.695
He would be gone. Yeah.

310
00:22:36.915 --> 00:22:40.215
That's A family member. Yeah.

311
00:22:41.155 --> 00:22:42.695
So somebody else, what did you feel

312
00:22:43.025 --> 00:22:46.535
after you shared, oh, I'm sorry.

313
00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:48.775
I thought that was my stuff again.

314
00:22:49.405 --> 00:22:52.375
What did you feel after you shared something sad

315
00:22:52.835 --> 00:22:55.535
and your spouse responded to that?

316
00:23:00.485 --> 00:23:00.775
Yeah,

317
00:23:01.135 --> 00:23:04.015
I felt a, a little, a little bit better. Understood.

318
00:23:04.445 --> 00:23:05.535
Okay. Um, Okay.

319
00:23:05.735 --> 00:23:07.895
I think there was an element of what I was sharing

320
00:23:07.895 --> 00:23:10.175
that we hadn't talked about much before.

321
00:23:10.475 --> 00:23:14.215
Mm-Hmm. Um, so it was like, oh, you didn't know that.

322
00:23:14.805 --> 00:23:17.615
Like you knew the story, but maybe not some details. Yeah.

323
00:23:17.995 --> 00:23:22.095
Um, so feeling a little incrementally a little

324
00:23:22.095 --> 00:23:23.135
bit better understood.

325
00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:27.895
Mm-Hmm. And then, so feeling

326
00:23:28.085 --> 00:23:29.455
just a lot of sympathy

327
00:23:30.115 --> 00:23:33.295
and that maybe I don't personally relate to it

328
00:23:34.945 --> 00:23:36.415
still felt a lot of sympathy.

329
00:23:36.995 --> 00:23:39.735
So feeling understood, feeling sympathy.

330
00:23:40.315 --> 00:23:42.895
Um, and then it kind of turned into some like,

331
00:23:43.485 --> 00:23:44.735
hope for action steps

332
00:23:44.735 --> 00:23:45.735
Forward, I guess.

333
00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:49.525
Hmm. Okay. Hopeful. Yeah.

334
00:23:49.545 --> 00:23:51.805
You're, you're picking up on a number of things

335
00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:54.045
that are probably happening in milliseconds.

336
00:23:54.905 --> 00:23:58.225
Thanks, Luke. Anybody else?

337
00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:02.585
Particularly looking for what you felt

338
00:24:02.835 --> 00:24:06.585
after you're spouse

339
00:24:08.215 --> 00:24:12.435
attempted to comfort you with some words that are not,

340
00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:14.525
here's what you need to do,

341
00:24:16.105 --> 00:24:18.245
but here's what I'm feeling for you

342
00:24:19.615 --> 00:24:21.525
About when I shared about

343
00:24:21.995 --> 00:24:23.405
what I'm going through with my dad.

344
00:24:23.825 --> 00:24:28.685
Mm-Hmm. Um, feeling the loss of the years of childhood,

345
00:24:29.025 --> 00:24:32.785
but now he's become, you know, dementia,

346
00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:35.425
but he's nicer and Mm-Hmm.

347
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:39.505
You know, and it's, we've built this anyway, it's just

348
00:24:40.305 --> 00:24:43.465
a little confusing, um, but able to share

349
00:24:43.605 --> 00:24:45.585
and then her response Mm-Hmm.

350
00:24:45.665 --> 00:24:46.705
Was just great.

351
00:24:46.845 --> 00:24:50.785
You know, you're facing that death of a father and Yeah.

352
00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:53.265
The loss, you know? Mm-Hmm.

353
00:24:53.345 --> 00:24:57.025
So just, uh, her and I just communicating

354
00:24:57.085 --> 00:24:59.425
and encouraging one another through the conversation.

355
00:24:59.455 --> 00:25:00.455
Yeah.

356
00:25:00.925 --> 00:25:05.225
So it sounds like chance that Leah

357
00:25:06.775 --> 00:25:08.745
reflected back accurately Mm-Hmm.

358
00:25:08.825 --> 00:25:11.345
What you were really trying to say. Correct.

359
00:25:12.355 --> 00:25:15.985
Which I would assume that helped you feel heard. Mm-Hmm.

360
00:25:16.165 --> 00:25:17.345
And understood. Yeah.

361
00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:21.065
Um, what about, uh,

362
00:25:22.965 --> 00:25:27.625
the sadness that you might have felt even thinking about

363
00:25:28.605 --> 00:25:30.185
the changes going on in dad,

364
00:25:30.995 --> 00:25:33.705
Ma'am, When she responded to you about that

365
00:25:34.895 --> 00:25:36.145
with her eyes, maybe?

366
00:25:36.415 --> 00:25:38.225
Yeah. Would that leave you feeling?

367
00:25:39.325 --> 00:25:42.345
Uh, just, uh, um, she understands.

368
00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:44.905
Um, she's right there with me Uhhuh.

369
00:25:45.295 --> 00:25:49.145
Okay. And, uh, it's, uh, um,

370
00:25:49.735 --> 00:25:51.225
comfort, I guess,

371
00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:52.945
You know, feel comforted. Yeah.

372
00:25:52.945 --> 00:25:54.505
Yeah. Just, uh, heard.

373
00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:58.945
Yeah. So, and I'm guessing you did not feel alone.

374
00:25:59.645 --> 00:26:03.985
No, no. You know, you can be sitting next to somebody

375
00:26:04.045 --> 00:26:07.465
and if they were trained, like I was trained growing up,

376
00:26:07.725 --> 00:26:11.145
and, and they start responding with lots of facts, logic,

377
00:26:11.205 --> 00:26:12.585
and reason or rationale,

378
00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:15.465
or here's what you might want to know about that

379
00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:17.465
thing that hurts you.

380
00:26:18.165 --> 00:26:20.585
If they start responding that way, even though they

381
00:26:21.165 --> 00:26:24.145
are well intended, you might even feel alone.

382
00:26:25.335 --> 00:26:27.665
Like, I'm not sure you got me. Okay.

383
00:26:28.245 --> 00:26:29.585
Now, I wanted to just take a moment

384
00:26:29.845 --> 00:26:33.265
and process that just with the helps and volunteers here.

385
00:26:35.195 --> 00:26:38.665
Every experience may not be as deep or as powerful,

386
00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:43.605
but what you just experienced in addition to Romans 1215

387
00:26:45.085 --> 00:26:47.005
b, mourn with those who mourn,

388
00:26:48.625 --> 00:26:50.925
you also experienced Matthew five, four,

389
00:26:51.015 --> 00:26:55.965
which is blessed are they who mourn for they shall be what?

390
00:26:56.915 --> 00:26:59.325
Comforted. Now you got

391
00:26:59.325 --> 00:27:01.085
that promise from your Heavenly Father,

392
00:27:01.625 --> 00:27:04.165
and he is described as the Father of compassion,

393
00:27:04.165 --> 00:27:05.325
the God of all comfort.

394
00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:11.125
He not only gets this process, he designed it. Okay?

395
00:27:11.315 --> 00:27:12.325
He's the author of it.

396
00:27:13.505 --> 00:27:15.885
But in that same passage that names him as a father

397
00:27:15.885 --> 00:27:18.005
of compassion, God of all comfort, he's also

398
00:27:19.035 --> 00:27:23.805
assigning us responsibility to give

399
00:27:23.865 --> 00:27:26.605
to others the same comfort we received from him.

400
00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:34.175
I had to learn how to do that at age 45, 19 years

401
00:27:34.175 --> 00:27:35.695
after I married this sweet bride.

402
00:27:38.395 --> 00:27:41.775
She had to wait 19 years for this boy to get it. Okay?

403
00:27:42.435 --> 00:27:43.735
And I hadn't gotten it either.

404
00:27:45.195 --> 00:27:47.495
No, you didn't get it growing up for sure. Right?

405
00:27:48.395 --> 00:27:53.055
And, uh, our testimony includes

406
00:27:53.085 --> 00:27:55.215
that we did not weep together

407
00:27:55.595 --> 00:27:58.895
as Romans 1215 commands us to do.

408
00:27:59.075 --> 00:28:02.055
We had, we did not do that for 19 years in our marriage.

409
00:28:03.755 --> 00:28:06.055
Not because we didn't love each other, but

410
00:28:06.055 --> 00:28:09.375
because we had no clue what that looked like, felt like,

411
00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:11.295
sounded like, why would you want to do that?

412
00:28:11.915 --> 00:28:13.815
And I'm saying, 'cause there's a promise in the scripture.

413
00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:15.975
It says, you'll be blessed if you do.

414
00:28:17.515 --> 00:28:19.375
You'll feel better if you do.

415
00:28:19.695 --> 00:28:22.495
I like the way, Luke, you said incrementally,

416
00:28:23.245 --> 00:28:24.415
I'll take incrementally.

417
00:28:24.965 --> 00:28:29.895
Okay. Sometimes it could be a gusher of comfort,

418
00:28:30.605 --> 00:28:33.815
like a Vietnam vet who had not shared some

419
00:28:33.815 --> 00:28:37.175
of the losses he went through for 30 plus years

420
00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:39.615
with his wife or anybody.

421
00:28:40.915 --> 00:28:45.015
And it all came out at once without

422
00:28:45.605 --> 00:28:47.335
anybody knowing what was coming.

423
00:28:48.755 --> 00:28:52.415
And for him, it was a cathartic release of a whole bunch

424
00:28:52.435 --> 00:28:54.775
of sobbing, tears all at once.

425
00:28:55.715 --> 00:28:59.055
And within seconds after he gathers himself

426
00:28:59.195 --> 00:29:02.295
and takes a deep breath, he says,

427
00:29:02.455 --> 00:29:04.775
I feel like a mountain's been lifted off my back.

428
00:29:05.635 --> 00:29:06.895
And he meant every word of it.

429
00:29:06.955 --> 00:29:11.375
And he's still preaching that. So thanks for doing that.

430
00:29:12.205 --> 00:29:16.165
Also, notice this is about as

431
00:29:16.965 --> 00:29:19.925
unlikely a scenario in which to do that exercise.

432
00:29:20.345 --> 00:29:23.685
You're in here crowded with a whole bunch of people, okay?

433
00:29:24.385 --> 00:29:28.325
And yet, um, I appreciate you making

434
00:29:28.325 --> 00:29:30.365
that effort, okay? But

435
00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:32.925
We'd encouraged to let it be a natural process

436
00:29:33.075 --> 00:29:34.885
that happens daily if you have to.

437
00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:37.485
Mm-Hmm. You may think of that number of things

438
00:29:37.745 --> 00:29:40.045
before you can't think of anything else.

439
00:29:40.235 --> 00:29:42.685
Yeah. Yeah.

440
00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:46.605
There's no limit to how often we might need it

441
00:29:47.025 --> 00:29:50.725
or might have opportunity to give it even to people that

442
00:29:51.745 --> 00:29:53.615
might be serving a set of restaurant.

443
00:29:54.155 --> 00:29:55.175
You know, you just never know.

444
00:29:55.475 --> 00:29:59.655
So, um, so that's

445
00:29:59.655 --> 00:30:02.375
what we focused on last week, was how do you deal with hurt?

446
00:30:02.515 --> 00:30:06.575
And how do you heal, hurt, uh, that has already happened.

447
00:30:07.355 --> 00:30:08.775
That's not about your marriage.

448
00:30:09.035 --> 00:30:12.455
Now, tonight we're gonna shift towards, okay,

449
00:30:12.475 --> 00:30:13.695
how do we now heal the hurt

450
00:30:13.695 --> 00:30:15.535
that comes about in the marriage?

451
00:30:17.045 --> 00:30:20.585
And yet that's a stu that's a foundation block for doing

452
00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:21.785
what we're going to do tonight.

453
00:30:21.885 --> 00:30:24.705
Now, we're not gonna share this one in the room, okay?

454
00:30:25.605 --> 00:30:27.305
I'm not that foolish. Okay?

455
00:30:27.705 --> 00:30:29.705
I was just about to remember I had something I needed to

456
00:30:32.975 --> 00:30:36.905
help anybody else there

457
00:30:36.905 --> 00:30:38.225
would've been a would come healthy.

458
00:30:39.415 --> 00:30:41.305
Yeah. I'm just glad I'm sitting on this side.

459
00:30:42.005 --> 00:30:44.865
Not in the way of the door. No, absolutely.

460
00:30:45.005 --> 00:30:47.745
We, but what we do want to do is to

461
00:30:48.485 --> 00:30:52.705
really help you understand the process that can make this

462
00:30:53.375 --> 00:30:58.185
very constructive and beneficial, bring you healing, okay?

463
00:31:00.205 --> 00:31:03.105
Um, You know,

464
00:31:03.425 --> 00:31:05.425
conflict's inevitable, period.

465
00:31:06.885 --> 00:31:08.745
But whenever you got two different minds,

466
00:31:08.745 --> 00:31:10.385
you're almost certainly gonna have

467
00:31:11.215 --> 00:31:13.385
some conflicts show up anytime.

468
00:31:13.485 --> 00:31:15.465
You don't even want to go to the same restaurant.

469
00:31:15.585 --> 00:31:16.585
I mean, that's conflict.

470
00:31:16.645 --> 00:31:18.225
It just hopefully is on a low level.

471
00:31:19.405 --> 00:31:23.665
And the pain that will inevitably come about

472
00:31:25.215 --> 00:31:28.655
includes hurt, may also include anger or fear, et cetera.

473
00:31:29.555 --> 00:31:31.535
The question is not do we hurt each other?

474
00:31:31.765 --> 00:31:33.855
It's if when we do, what do we do with it?

475
00:31:35.205 --> 00:31:37.455
What do we do with it? Does it just kind

476
00:31:37.455 --> 00:31:41.175
of get swept under a rug as we did really well for 19 years?

477
00:31:41.995 --> 00:31:45.535
Or do we have a way to actually address it

478
00:31:45.705 --> 00:31:48.375
where it doesn't feel like we just stepped

479
00:31:48.375 --> 00:31:49.455
on another landmine?

480
00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:52.895
Okay? So that's what we're gonna talk about.

481
00:31:53.965 --> 00:31:55.295
What do we want to do about it?

482
00:31:55.995 --> 00:31:57.695
So I'm gonna show you one other video tonight.

483
00:31:57.765 --> 00:31:59.975
This is, uh, the Fergusons

484
00:32:00.805 --> 00:32:03.135
sharing another clip out of their story.

485
00:32:03.595 --> 00:32:06.215
You have a, uh, you have an audio on that other tab,

486
00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:14.195
You scared, but you arms strong.

487
00:32:14.645 --> 00:32:15.645
We're gonna make,

488
00:32:18.765 --> 00:32:19.765
Thank you.

489
00:32:22.695 --> 00:32:27.475
Praise the Lord. The importance

490
00:32:27.495 --> 00:32:29.555
of, uh, being attentive

491
00:32:29.555 --> 00:32:32.355
and sensitive to the ways in which our partner has already

492
00:32:32.355 --> 00:32:35.275
been hurt in order that we not be a part

493
00:32:35.275 --> 00:32:37.755
of reinjuring them in those very same ways.

494
00:32:38.055 --> 00:32:41.045
We ended up in one of those, uh, on an occasion

495
00:32:41.415 --> 00:32:43.445
where we're about to have a family gathering.

496
00:32:44.105 --> 00:32:46.325
And, um, Theresa's an awesome cook.

497
00:32:46.945 --> 00:32:50.685
And, um, I had this silly idea that I think I'm gonna help.

498
00:32:51.145 --> 00:32:52.525
So I'll just let her take it from there.

499
00:32:53.255 --> 00:32:56.765
David says, I have an extra gift called whip and drive.

500
00:32:57.545 --> 00:32:59.685
And when I've got things to do,

501
00:32:59.895 --> 00:33:02.205
especially people coming over to eat,

502
00:33:02.785 --> 00:33:05.165
and I'm gonna cook, I am in my whip

503
00:33:05.165 --> 00:33:08.565
and drive mode, which means I'm not very sensitive.

504
00:33:08.565 --> 00:33:10.485
Those people around me because of my whip

505
00:33:10.485 --> 00:33:12.045
and drive, uh, mode.

506
00:33:12.835 --> 00:33:16.245
Well, and David trying to help, he's never cooked before.

507
00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:20.925
And he decided that he had seen other men barbecue.

508
00:33:21.145 --> 00:33:23.525
And what they did was make the barbecue sauce.

509
00:33:24.115 --> 00:33:27.565
Well, he came in and started mixing up this already

510
00:33:27.885 --> 00:33:29.045
prepared barbecue sauce.

511
00:33:29.665 --> 00:33:31.285
And Ms. Woodman Drive said,

512
00:33:31.755 --> 00:33:34.445
what do you think you're doing about?

513
00:33:34.625 --> 00:33:38.605
And just about that tone, at which point he looked at me,

514
00:33:38.785 --> 00:33:41.205
he threw his fort down, turned around,

515
00:33:41.305 --> 00:33:42.405
and walked out of the kitchen.

516
00:33:43.265 --> 00:33:46.205
Now, at that moment, I knew what I had done to my husband.

517
00:33:46.875 --> 00:33:48.245
This is called intimacy.

518
00:33:48.245 --> 00:33:50.925
Really knowing the person that you're married to

519
00:33:51.505 --> 00:33:54.645
and knowing that pain that they may still have inside

520
00:33:54.645 --> 00:33:56.565
of them, I knew at

521
00:33:56.565 --> 00:33:58.845
that point there wasn't anything in the world for me

522
00:33:58.845 --> 00:34:02.005
to do except go in the living room, sit down next to David

523
00:34:02.185 --> 00:34:05.725
and tell him how deeply I knew that I'd just hurt him.

524
00:34:06.185 --> 00:34:07.325
And to confess to him

525
00:34:07.505 --> 00:34:11.725
and tell him I'm so deeply saddened that I've hurt you.

526
00:34:12.225 --> 00:34:13.405
The level that I hurt you.

527
00:34:13.865 --> 00:34:16.005
His father was a practicing alcoholic.

528
00:34:16.865 --> 00:34:18.325
And when he would go out

529
00:34:18.345 --> 00:34:21.965
and try to help Mr. Ferguson work on the car, instead

530
00:34:21.965 --> 00:34:23.885
of Mr. Ferguson being kind and patient

531
00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:26.645
and teaching him, he would curse at him if

532
00:34:26.645 --> 00:34:27.765
he gave him the wrong tool.

533
00:34:27.785 --> 00:34:31.205
If David gave the wrong tool to him, he would curse at him

534
00:34:31.225 --> 00:34:32.285
and send him in the house.

535
00:34:32.995 --> 00:34:35.365
Well, that's exactly the way David felt

536
00:34:35.765 --> 00:34:37.085
whenever I said in that tone,

537
00:34:37.675 --> 00:34:38.885
what do you think you're doing?

538
00:34:39.555 --> 00:34:41.885
It's like I tore off a scar

539
00:34:42.385 --> 00:34:45.245
or a wound that my husband had deeply within him,

540
00:34:45.705 --> 00:34:49.685
and that was my job then to help heal that wound

541
00:34:49.715 --> 00:34:51.285
that I just opened up. Mm-Hmm.

542
00:34:51.985 --> 00:34:55.045
You know, and the, the blessing of that experience,

543
00:34:55.045 --> 00:34:56.965
even the midst of the pain of it, uh,

544
00:34:57.105 --> 00:35:00.845
is reflected in the simplicity of the Bible passage.

545
00:35:01.015 --> 00:35:03.965
There is a blessing with those who mourn,

546
00:35:03.965 --> 00:35:05.405
when they shall be comforted.

547
00:35:05.745 --> 00:35:06.805
So even in the midst of the pain

548
00:35:07.085 --> 00:35:09.485
and hurt, uh, Theresa's sharing of compassion

549
00:35:09.485 --> 00:35:11.565
and comfort was an enormous blessing.

550
00:35:11.865 --> 00:35:14.565
And that set us on a course of practicing

551
00:35:14.675 --> 00:35:17.205
that Bible verse over and over and over,

552
00:35:17.205 --> 00:35:18.965
because it's not gonna be very long until

553
00:35:19.395 --> 00:35:20.725
It's not a one time thing. It's

554
00:35:20.725 --> 00:35:21.725
Not a one time thing. It's

555
00:35:21.725 --> 00:35:23.045
not gonna be a long time before one

556
00:35:23.045 --> 00:35:24.605
or the other of us we're gonna be disappointed

557
00:35:24.605 --> 00:35:28.045
or hurt by all kinds of things, uh, in our daily lives

558
00:35:28.185 --> 00:35:29.965
or in our relationships or friendships.

559
00:35:30.265 --> 00:35:31.885
And so we've learned that the practice

560
00:35:31.885 --> 00:35:34.165
of comforting one another is one of the best ways

561
00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:36.005
to keep our marriage intimacy close.

562
00:35:36.265 --> 00:35:37.265
Mm.

563
00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:54.085
Okay. So

564
00:35:58.585 --> 00:36:01.005
he mentioned his dad was a practicing alcoholic,

565
00:36:01.065 --> 00:36:05.045
or she mentioned that he was also a marine drill instructor.

566
00:36:05.945 --> 00:36:07.925
Bad combination. Okay.

567
00:36:09.025 --> 00:36:13.245
So a key hindrance when we

568
00:36:14.115 --> 00:36:16.845
seek to heal things

569
00:36:16.845 --> 00:36:19.645
that just naturally happen in our relationships,

570
00:36:20.195 --> 00:36:21.845
everybody experiences this.

571
00:36:21.975 --> 00:36:24.485
Joyce and I don't have to go more in about 48 hours

572
00:36:24.505 --> 00:36:27.205
before we got a new illustration.

573
00:36:27.205 --> 00:36:30.445
We can use how to do it wrong. Okay?

574
00:36:31.465 --> 00:36:35.165
But, um, here's what often, uh,

575
00:36:36.835 --> 00:36:41.615
we find the most natural tendency that we have

576
00:36:42.995 --> 00:36:44.365
when dealing with behavior

577
00:36:45.345 --> 00:36:48.925
and someone else, like our spouse behavior

578
00:36:48.925 --> 00:36:52.325
that's either hurtful to us, annoys us, it's difficult,

579
00:36:53.745 --> 00:36:57.325
or we're just arguing over who, who knows what's right.

580
00:36:58.065 --> 00:37:02.765
The biggest obstacle is we focus in the wrong direction.

581
00:37:02.825 --> 00:37:05.525
We focus on our spouse's behavior.

582
00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:11.055
And that might not be too bad, as long

583
00:37:11.055 --> 00:37:14.215
as they are filled with grace in that moment.

584
00:37:14.965 --> 00:37:17.535
They've got plenty of emotional bandwidth.

585
00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:18.775
They're not stressed out.

586
00:37:19.115 --> 00:37:21.655
In fact, they just got back from a trip

587
00:37:21.675 --> 00:37:23.055
to the spa or something like that.

588
00:37:23.315 --> 00:37:24.655
You know, they're just in great shape

589
00:37:24.655 --> 00:37:26.015
and they say, Hey,

590
00:37:26.455 --> 00:37:29.055
I didn't know you were having a problem with that.

591
00:37:29.125 --> 00:37:32.295
Tell me what you need. But that's not normally what happens,

592
00:37:32.435 --> 00:37:36.055
is it, it's usually somebody's accusing

593
00:37:36.155 --> 00:37:37.335
and somebody's defendant.

594
00:37:37.435 --> 00:37:40.935
And then those roles might switch the next day. Okay?

595
00:37:41.475 --> 00:37:44.855
And the problem that we want to help you be aware of

596
00:37:45.635 --> 00:37:49.695
is it's natural to do that, but it's not very productive.

597
00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:52.695
Okay? In fact, a good God

598
00:37:54.525 --> 00:37:55.975
Decided to help me with that.

599
00:37:56.115 --> 00:37:58.375
At that 19 year point in our marriage, he,

600
00:37:58.645 --> 00:38:03.055
he's basically bringing to mind a passage in Matthew, uh,

601
00:38:03.065 --> 00:38:06.015
seven verses one through five.

602
00:38:06.915 --> 00:38:10.175
It says, do not judge so that you will not be judged.

603
00:38:10.635 --> 00:38:13.895
Ooh, that's pretty useful and wise right there, isn't it?

604
00:38:14.675 --> 00:38:16.695
For in the way you judge you will be judged,

605
00:38:16.715 --> 00:38:19.495
and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.

606
00:38:20.075 --> 00:38:21.335
Why do you look at the spec?

607
00:38:21.405 --> 00:38:24.775
It's in your brother's slash spouse's eye,

608
00:38:25.955 --> 00:38:28.535
but do not notice the log that is in your eye.

609
00:38:29.475 --> 00:38:30.735
Or how can you say to your brother,

610
00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:32.695
let me take the speck outta your eye.

611
00:38:33.715 --> 00:38:36.645
And look, the log is in your own, your own eye.

612
00:38:37.345 --> 00:38:38.925
You hypocrite Bruce.

613
00:38:39.815 --> 00:38:41.605
First, take the log outta your own eye,

614
00:38:41.825 --> 00:38:42.965
and then you can see clearly

615
00:38:43.065 --> 00:38:44.965
to take the speck outta your brother's eye.

616
00:38:45.905 --> 00:38:47.605
Notice what he said there at the end.

617
00:38:49.435 --> 00:38:51.685
It's not, you can never address

618
00:38:52.585 --> 00:38:54.605
the speck in your spouse's eye.

619
00:38:55.145 --> 00:38:58.605
It doesn't say that it leaves the door open that you can,

620
00:38:58.745 --> 00:39:02.605
it just says what first Remove the login, your Honor.

621
00:39:03.505 --> 00:39:07.445
So what he is saying to me is, first of all, Bruce,

622
00:39:07.735 --> 00:39:10.205
let's put our focus here instead of here.

623
00:39:11.265 --> 00:39:12.445
Now, that doesn't mean, again,

624
00:39:12.445 --> 00:39:14.325
something she's doing is bothering me.

625
00:39:15.635 --> 00:39:18.845
It's just saying, let's first have a look over here

626
00:39:19.185 --> 00:39:22.565
and see if there's anything here that might need addressing.

627
00:39:23.345 --> 00:39:27.045
And then if you do that, then you will be in better position

628
00:39:27.105 --> 00:39:30.605
to be able to help me help her.

629
00:39:32.705 --> 00:39:35.645
It is on the job description of the Holy Spirit

630
00:39:35.865 --> 00:39:37.325
to convict us of sin.

631
00:39:38.535 --> 00:39:41.625
It is not on my job description. Does that make sense?

632
00:39:42.685 --> 00:39:45.345
So I was oftentimes getting in the way of the Holy Spirit

633
00:39:45.365 --> 00:39:46.705
and distracting Joyce from

634
00:39:46.705 --> 00:39:48.265
what the Lord might be telling her.

635
00:39:48.735 --> 00:39:52.265
Does that make sense? So we're gonna practice that.

636
00:39:53.805 --> 00:39:58.465
Now, in your material this week, it was leading you through

637
00:39:58.645 --> 00:40:00.185
and towards doing this.

638
00:40:01.925 --> 00:40:04.585
And, uh, some of you may have already had a marriage staff

639
00:40:04.585 --> 00:40:07.025
meeting where you actually process some

640
00:40:07.025 --> 00:40:08.425
of these hurts with each other.

641
00:40:09.005 --> 00:40:12.105
And I commend you. If you did, it probably won't be

642
00:40:12.765 --> 00:40:14.465
the last time you need to do it.

643
00:40:14.815 --> 00:40:17.985
Okay? It's gonna be an ongoing process, okay?

644
00:40:18.805 --> 00:40:22.505
But we're basically saying that I'm going to

645
00:40:24.135 --> 00:40:26.745
make a list for myself

646
00:40:27.365 --> 00:40:30.305
of ways I hurt Joyce.

647
00:40:32.765 --> 00:40:36.705
And then I will also make a list of ways she hurt me.

648
00:40:37.815 --> 00:40:39.385
Because both are important.

649
00:40:39.645 --> 00:40:42.745
And God's not saying I should be stuffing what's over here.

650
00:40:43.805 --> 00:40:46.785
He cares about whatever is hurting me too.

651
00:40:48.125 --> 00:40:51.185
But in order to first look at the speck in my own eye,

652
00:40:52.645 --> 00:40:54.945
we would encourage people to make a list

653
00:40:55.205 --> 00:40:58.785
of whatever God brings to your mind of ways

654
00:40:58.785 --> 00:40:59.905
that you hurt your spouse.

655
00:41:01.645 --> 00:41:04.745
And when we first did this, we were about 45 years old,

656
00:41:04.805 --> 00:41:06.105
had been married 19 years,

657
00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:09.705
and we had a lot of catching up to do.

658
00:41:10.665 --> 00:41:12.225
'cause we'd never done anything like that before.

659
00:41:12.805 --> 00:41:15.505
The best we ever did was we'd say, okay, I'm sorry.

660
00:41:16.705 --> 00:41:18.985
I won't do that again. I,

661
00:41:20.565 --> 00:41:23.945
and I might have even really truly sincerely meant it,

662
00:41:24.885 --> 00:41:27.785
but that didn't heal the hurt that was already in her heart.

663
00:41:28.975 --> 00:41:30.985
That was a promise for the future.

664
00:41:32.045 --> 00:41:35.605
And the, I'm sorry, didn't come close to communicating

665
00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:38.965
my understanding of how she might be feeling.

666
00:41:39.475 --> 00:41:43.045
Okay? That's critically important. Yes.

667
00:41:44.025 --> 00:41:46.405
So the comment of David

668
00:41:46.465 --> 00:41:50.005
and Barbara where she said he, he was just oblivious.

669
00:41:50.395 --> 00:41:53.925
Yeah. Yeah. How do you, how do you address that?

670
00:41:54.625 --> 00:41:57.125
How do you In the, the extent was Yeah.

671
00:41:57.265 --> 00:41:58.725
In the book it was very good.

672
00:41:58.965 --> 00:42:02.885
I mean, obviously the Lord brought it to mind for David

673
00:42:03.865 --> 00:42:06.365
as to here he is getting upset with his wife.

674
00:42:06.365 --> 00:42:08.525
She's making those trips back and forth. Yeah.

675
00:42:08.635 --> 00:42:12.125
He's in the car upset because he, she's making him late.

676
00:42:12.145 --> 00:42:13.685
But not once did it occur to him

677
00:42:13.685 --> 00:42:15.085
to get out of the car to help her.

678
00:42:15.235 --> 00:42:18.605
Yeah. Yeah. And I'm sitting there going, oh Lord,

679
00:42:19.435 --> 00:42:23.245
Yeah, My husband is awesome, but he's oblivious

680
00:42:23.245 --> 00:42:24.245
Most, most the time. Joyce

681
00:42:24.245 --> 00:42:27.645
might join you in that description. Uh, hopefully. I

682
00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:29.765
Guess what I'm trying to share is you made a comment there

683
00:42:29.795 --> 00:42:31.565
that says to make those lists.

684
00:42:31.565 --> 00:42:34.525
But if you're oblivious to that, those lists exist. Okay?

685
00:42:34.525 --> 00:42:37.045
How can you make the list? Rosa, you are helping me.

686
00:42:37.865 --> 00:42:40.685
You just set the table for me real well there. And

687
00:42:40.685 --> 00:42:43.725
Rosa, That may not be the thing I'm oblivious about,

688
00:42:43.725 --> 00:42:45.645
but I'm oblivious about a lot of

689
00:42:45.645 --> 00:42:46.925
Other things you see? Yes,

690
00:42:47.155 --> 00:42:48.155
Exactly. Exactly.

691
00:42:48.155 --> 00:42:50.605
So there is a reality

692
00:42:50.675 --> 00:42:52.605
that says somebody's not oblivious

693
00:42:53.225 --> 00:42:56.045
and they're not even limited to our human brain capacity.

694
00:42:56.045 --> 00:42:57.045
And that's God himself.

695
00:42:57.145 --> 00:43:00.285
The Holy Spirit knows every single time

696
00:43:00.385 --> 00:43:03.365
and way that I've hurt Joyce.

697
00:43:03.385 --> 00:43:06.525
And then secondly, how I may have been oblivious to it or,

698
00:43:07.025 --> 00:43:08.285
or not realized it,

699
00:43:09.025 --> 00:43:11.045
or distracted by all kinds of other things.

700
00:43:11.785 --> 00:43:16.165
So what we recommend people do is you pray

701
00:43:16.225 --> 00:43:17.525
before you make this list.

702
00:43:18.385 --> 00:43:20.805
Now that sounds like a good Christian thing to do, right?

703
00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:24.405
But pray, believing that the Holy Spirit wants

704
00:43:24.405 --> 00:43:25.485
to answer your prayer.

705
00:43:25.705 --> 00:43:28.085
If you're saying, how have I hurt my spouse?

706
00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:31.965
Wouldn't it be consistent with a good God who wants

707
00:43:31.965 --> 00:43:36.245
to bring about healing and reconciliation and peace

708
00:43:36.785 --> 00:43:38.165
and harmony and all those things?

709
00:43:39.975 --> 00:43:42.395
I'm not saying that just flippantly, oh, just pray.

710
00:43:42.665 --> 00:43:47.135
Just pray. No, I'm saying I need to tap in

711
00:43:47.235 --> 00:43:50.895
and be listening because his still small voice did exactly

712
00:43:51.205 --> 00:43:54.575
what I needed to get less oblivious.

713
00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:57.895
Does that make sense? I didn't say not oblivious.

714
00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:01.055
I said less right? I pray.

715
00:44:01.435 --> 00:44:03.895
We were actually at a, at a retreat

716
00:44:04.435 --> 00:44:06.935
and they gave us the evening to do this exercise.

717
00:44:08.075 --> 00:44:11.975
And so we actually were just following the guidelines like

718
00:44:11.975 --> 00:44:14.415
you'll have in something I hand out to you.

719
00:44:15.635 --> 00:44:18.775
And we just walk through that by ourselves first praying

720
00:44:18.915 --> 00:44:23.055
and saying, Lord, you promised me, if I confess my sins,

721
00:44:24.275 --> 00:44:25.335
you'll forgive me.

722
00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:31.845
You will forgive me. You promised me. So what are my sins?

723
00:44:31.915 --> 00:44:33.885
What have I done? How have I hurt her?

724
00:44:34.345 --> 00:44:37.285
And within one second of praying that prayer, I

725
00:44:37.965 --> 00:44:41.885
remembered something I'd forgotten for 19 years.

726
00:44:43.665 --> 00:44:47.325
And I'm gonna actually share what it was, regardless of what

727
00:44:47.325 --> 00:44:49.205
that might cause you to think about me.

728
00:44:49.265 --> 00:44:52.325
But I'm gonna share what that was as an illustration.

729
00:44:52.425 --> 00:44:53.885
It fits into what we're doing.

730
00:44:55.565 --> 00:44:57.885
I prayed, help me remember ways that I've hurt.

731
00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.965
Joyce had my pen and yellow pad there.

732
00:45:00.745 --> 00:45:04.685
And I actually have this thought come to my mind.

733
00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:09.135
How about the time when you told her you

734
00:45:09.135 --> 00:45:10.295
had changed your mind?

735
00:45:13.055 --> 00:45:14.425
We'd been married 19 years.

736
00:45:15.455 --> 00:45:17.585
What do you think I was changing my mind about?

737
00:45:18.655 --> 00:45:21.185
Anybody want to hazard to guess on that one? The marriage.

738
00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:22.185
Married the marriage.

739
00:45:23.895 --> 00:45:26.185
Does anybody remember how quickly we got married?

740
00:45:27.005 --> 00:45:28.425
Oh, Two months, four months.

741
00:45:29.495 --> 00:45:31.865
That means I proposed about a month into the

742
00:45:32.045 --> 00:45:34.145
dating she accepts.

743
00:45:34.845 --> 00:45:37.825
And about a week and a half later, I go back to her

744
00:45:37.845 --> 00:45:40.665
and say, Joyce, I've changed my mind.

745
00:45:43.765 --> 00:45:46.935
And what do you think that left her feeling?

746
00:45:49.335 --> 00:45:53.695
Somebody guess out loud, rejected. What else were we saying?

747
00:45:53.695 --> 00:45:55.895
Inadequate. Inadequate. Well, that was me.

748
00:45:56.845 --> 00:45:59.935
What did she feel? And she could have felt inadequate alone

749
00:45:59.935 --> 00:46:01.215
because you were alone and

750
00:46:01.215 --> 00:46:02.215
Abandoned. Abandoned

751
00:46:02.215 --> 00:46:03.415
with her. And

752
00:46:04.125 --> 00:46:06.135
That she didn't matter. Oh, the dad.

753
00:46:06.325 --> 00:46:08.055
That she didn't matter. The Dad,

754
00:46:09.035 --> 00:46:10.035
I'm sorry. Was it your

755
00:46:10.035 --> 00:46:11.895
dad that Yes. The same thing.

756
00:46:13.485 --> 00:46:16.495
That Good catch. Good catch. That was, it

757
00:46:16.495 --> 00:46:18.735
Was the, it was the kind of thing where it was like, okay,

758
00:46:18.835 --> 00:46:20.575
I'm used to this, this is happened to me

759
00:46:20.575 --> 00:46:23.535
before I can stand on my feet.

760
00:46:23.955 --> 00:46:25.855
Mm-Hmm. I'll deal with it. Yeah.

761
00:46:27.165 --> 00:46:28.655
Yeah. So that's a good catch.

762
00:46:28.715 --> 00:46:32.255
But even if she had never been abandoned by anybody else,

763
00:46:32.835 --> 00:46:34.495
she might have felt abandoned that day.

764
00:46:35.155 --> 00:46:37.935
And as far as she knew, she would never see my face again.

765
00:46:38.655 --> 00:46:41.575
'cause I was on her doorstep telling her I've changed my

766
00:46:41.575 --> 00:46:45.565
mind and I did not feel good

767
00:46:46.405 --> 00:46:47.445
standing on that doorstep.

768
00:46:47.565 --> 00:46:48.805
I mean, I, I know better.

769
00:46:49.085 --> 00:46:51.405
I know better make promises and break 'em. Mm-Hmm.

770
00:46:52.165 --> 00:46:53.285
I wasn't a believer at the time,

771
00:46:53.385 --> 00:46:55.925
but I know that I had a value

772
00:46:55.945 --> 00:46:57.685
of you're not supposed to break promises.

773
00:46:58.145 --> 00:47:00.645
And I was doing that right there to make sense.

774
00:47:02.385 --> 00:47:04.885
Can I I have one little mm-Hmm.

775
00:47:04.965 --> 00:47:08.245
Eight And the B So the B on that is, and I,

776
00:47:08.345 --> 00:47:10.285
and please nobody take advantage of this.

777
00:47:10.505 --> 00:47:15.085
Mm-Hmm. I'm asking is this a Venus and Mars thing?

778
00:47:15.345 --> 00:47:16.445
I'm just asking a little

779
00:47:16.495 --> 00:47:17.495
Great question. The

780
00:47:17.495 --> 00:47:19.165
reason being is I hear a lot

781
00:47:19.165 --> 00:47:20.685
of my girlfriend saying the same thing,

782
00:47:20.715 --> 00:47:22.285
that their husbands are oblivious.

783
00:47:22.285 --> 00:47:25.045
Yeah. I thought, oh, I thought it was just not. Yeah.

784
00:47:25.225 --> 00:47:27.965
I'm asking is it a Venus Mars thing,

785
00:47:27.965 --> 00:47:28.965
Really? No,

786
00:47:28.965 --> 00:47:30.765
it's not. It's not. It's not.

787
00:47:31.065 --> 00:47:34.045
And, uh, in case you don't, haven't heard of the book

788
00:47:34.045 --> 00:47:35.165
or read the book Venus

789
00:47:35.165 --> 00:47:38.605
and Mars by a guy named John Gray, um,

790
00:47:39.105 --> 00:47:40.285
he was pointing out

791
00:47:40.285 --> 00:47:42.725
and emphasizing a lot the differences between men and women.

792
00:47:42.775 --> 00:47:46.165
There are definite differences physiologically as well

793
00:47:46.165 --> 00:47:47.365
as mentally, et cetera.

794
00:47:47.525 --> 00:47:49.605
There are differences and there are things

795
00:47:49.605 --> 00:47:51.325
that men are a bit more prone to do

796
00:47:51.425 --> 00:47:53.045
and women are a bit more prone to do.

797
00:47:53.225 --> 00:47:55.525
But that one's not one of them. Oh, okay. Okay.

798
00:47:56.225 --> 00:47:59.805
Um, women are probably more global in their thinking, and

799
00:47:59.805 --> 00:48:02.365
therefore they're tap tapping into their emotionality.

800
00:48:02.985 --> 00:48:05.125
But I wouldn't say men are less emotional.

801
00:48:05.395 --> 00:48:07.725
It's women have more connections between the brain.

802
00:48:07.725 --> 00:48:08.965
That's one thing he brings out.

803
00:48:09.225 --> 00:48:12.165
But no, this is more about, am I even

804
00:48:13.545 --> 00:48:17.205
asking God to help me better care for my spouse?

805
00:48:18.025 --> 00:48:19.525
Am I even asking that question?

806
00:48:19.525 --> 00:48:22.925
Because he, uh,

807
00:48:23.655 --> 00:48:25.165
knows and he cares.

808
00:48:25.305 --> 00:48:27.245
And he's put his neck out there on the table

809
00:48:27.385 --> 00:48:31.045
and said, you know, get in a yolk with me

810
00:48:31.045 --> 00:48:32.405
and I'll help you learn.

811
00:48:33.185 --> 00:48:36.325
So we would simply say, if you follow the process

812
00:48:36.515 --> 00:48:38.325
that we're laying out here, which is very biblical,

813
00:48:38.425 --> 00:48:42.485
if you follow the process, you might bump into some kind

814
00:48:42.485 --> 00:48:45.045
of obstacle even as you're trying to do it.

815
00:48:45.105 --> 00:48:47.085
But chances are it's gonna help.

816
00:48:48.745 --> 00:48:51.845
And there is a, there is a fallback just in case.

817
00:48:53.215 --> 00:48:57.125
Let's say that I make this list and I make this list.

818
00:49:00.075 --> 00:49:00.925
It's too long, long.

819
00:49:06.625 --> 00:49:08.245
That's my help mate right there.

820
00:49:10.195 --> 00:49:11.845
What am I supposed to do with this list?

821
00:49:12.145 --> 00:49:15.485
The ways I heard her, I'm supposed to confess it,

822
00:49:16.175 --> 00:49:19.765
which literally means to say the same as,

823
00:49:21.265 --> 00:49:24.965
so if I'm confessing that first thing, I, I broke a promise.

824
00:49:25.165 --> 00:49:26.405
I re nicked on my proposal.

825
00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:30.785
If I'm confessing it, I'm agreeing

826
00:49:30.785 --> 00:49:31.985
with God that that was wrong.

827
00:49:33.645 --> 00:49:37.855
Whether she was hurt or not, it's still wrong. Okay?

828
00:49:38.835 --> 00:49:41.815
So I'm confessing to God and he promises he'll forgive me

829
00:49:42.855 --> 00:49:44.715
and he doesn't, Rene on his promises.

830
00:49:47.495 --> 00:49:51.155
And, uh, so I'm confessing that

831
00:49:53.385 --> 00:49:56.485
and the verse that I just referenced about his promises.

832
00:49:56.485 --> 00:49:57.845
First John one, nine.

833
00:49:59.105 --> 00:50:02.045
But then I'm gonna bring that confession to her.

834
00:50:03.645 --> 00:50:04.785
But that's what I'm supposed to do

835
00:50:04.785 --> 00:50:05.905
with everything on this list.

836
00:50:06.085 --> 00:50:08.865
I'm supposed to agree with God, confess it,

837
00:50:09.205 --> 00:50:13.145
and then care for the hurt, hurt

838
00:50:13.145 --> 00:50:14.265
with those who hurt.

839
00:50:14.535 --> 00:50:17.345
It's just, I waited 19 years to bring it up.

840
00:50:18.685 --> 00:50:21.385
She was not nagging me about it. She wasn't bringing it up.

841
00:50:21.505 --> 00:50:23.425
I don't think she really wanted to talk about it.

842
00:50:23.665 --> 00:50:25.585
'cause it would just stir up pain in

843
00:50:25.585 --> 00:50:27.065
her remembering that, right?

844
00:50:28.385 --> 00:50:31.805
But once I bring it up, she doesn't have

845
00:50:31.805 --> 00:50:35.145
to drag it outta me For once.

846
00:50:35.245 --> 00:50:37.625
I'm not being oblivious for once.

847
00:50:37.785 --> 00:50:39.465
I am taking initiative to care.

848
00:50:40.135 --> 00:50:42.065
When I bring that up, she is

849
00:50:44.955 --> 00:50:49.865
vulnerable and she, she's listening

850
00:50:49.865 --> 00:50:51.465
to everything I'm saying at that point.

851
00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:52.985
Does that make sense? Mm-Hmm.

852
00:50:53.885 --> 00:50:57.865
So part of what this, uh, handout's gonna do is

853
00:50:57.865 --> 00:51:01.465
to give you sort of a, um, template for,

854
00:51:03.505 --> 00:51:04.755
what do I need to say?

855
00:51:04.775 --> 00:51:06.795
How do I need to present that to her?

856
00:51:07.455 --> 00:51:10.195
So what it's going to boil down to is

857
00:51:13.435 --> 00:51:16.235
I want to name something to her that's specific.

858
00:51:16.515 --> 00:51:19.675
I remember the time when I told you I changed my mind

859
00:51:20.205 --> 00:51:21.315
about getting married.

860
00:51:23.015 --> 00:51:24.955
That's specific. If I just go there

861
00:51:24.955 --> 00:51:26.755
and say, I am sure I've messed up

862
00:51:27.485 --> 00:51:29.035
being oblivious way too long.

863
00:51:30.055 --> 00:51:32.395
I'm sure I have not been the best husband in the world,

864
00:51:32.765 --> 00:51:36.475
God's probably mad at me and I sure hope you can forgive me.

865
00:51:37.615 --> 00:51:40.555
That's not gonna go over very well, is you. See that?

866
00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:42.755
That's way vague, number one.

867
00:51:42.855 --> 00:51:45.635
And it's not really owning anything, okay?

868
00:51:47.005 --> 00:51:49.335
When I say specifically, I remember

869
00:51:50.125 --> 00:51:53.415
something we have not talked about one time in 19 years.

870
00:51:55.475 --> 00:51:57.295
Got our attention. Okay?

871
00:51:57.515 --> 00:51:59.575
Second thing, call it wrong,

872
00:52:03.805 --> 00:52:06.535
with no ifs, ands, or buts.

873
00:52:08.195 --> 00:52:09.255
Big period right there.

874
00:52:09.965 --> 00:52:11.935
What, what I might be tempted to say is,

875
00:52:11.955 --> 00:52:14.895
but you know, I was so stressed out.

876
00:52:14.975 --> 00:52:16.415
I had just come back from overseas.

877
00:52:16.735 --> 00:52:19.335
I didn't even have my feet on ground, did not have a job.

878
00:52:20.135 --> 00:52:22.215
I mean, I got lots of excuses here, right?

879
00:52:24.035 --> 00:52:26.535
But what if I bring those up right after I say

880
00:52:29.225 --> 00:52:30.225
Neg? I think I heard

881
00:52:30.225 --> 00:52:32.645
you. That would just dilute whatever

882
00:52:32.715 --> 00:52:33.765
good was about to happen.

883
00:52:34.635 --> 00:52:38.685
Make sense? And yet again, our flesh,

884
00:52:39.035 --> 00:52:40.125
once it is like Adam

885
00:52:40.145 --> 00:52:42.125
and Eve in the Garden of Eden, they're saying, you know,

886
00:52:42.145 --> 00:52:45.285
we didn't really mean to, you know, all kinds

887
00:52:45.285 --> 00:52:48.565
of excuses we're hiding, got fig leaves. Now

888
00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:50.065
It was her fault.

889
00:52:50.585 --> 00:52:54.245
It was a woman, right? That you gave me. Blame God.

890
00:52:56.115 --> 00:52:59.965
Yeah, that'll preach. But, uh, call it wrong.

891
00:53:00.065 --> 00:53:03.565
No ifs, ands or buts, including, um,

892
00:53:05.635 --> 00:53:08.685
we'd highly discourage you from saying I didn't mean to.

893
00:53:09.915 --> 00:53:11.205
Hopefully you didn't mean to.

894
00:53:12.275 --> 00:53:15.565
Hopefully it was not malicious. Whatever you did.

895
00:53:17.025 --> 00:53:19.165
But that too sounds like an excuse.

896
00:53:19.185 --> 00:53:20.845
So you're better off just saying it was

897
00:53:20.845 --> 00:53:22.085
wrong of me to do that.

898
00:53:22.385 --> 00:53:24.925
Period. Third thing

899
00:53:26.305 --> 00:53:28.725
may be the most important empathize.

900
00:53:32.755 --> 00:53:35.285
When I asked you, what do you think that made her feel?

901
00:53:36.825 --> 00:53:39.405
And, and a bunch of words were thrown out there.

902
00:53:40.595 --> 00:53:42.605
Everybody who was thinking

903
00:53:42.665 --> 00:53:45.325
or speaking words right then was empathizing.

904
00:53:45.505 --> 00:53:48.285
Mm-Hmm. You're trying to imagine what

905
00:53:48.285 --> 00:53:50.365
that would make this person feel.

906
00:53:50.365 --> 00:53:54.805
Even though you've never been, you know, in her brain.

907
00:53:56.195 --> 00:53:58.085
It's just saying, based on what I know

908
00:53:58.145 --> 00:53:59.965
and my experiences, I'm guessing

909
00:53:59.965 --> 00:54:01.445
that would leave her feeling abandoned.

910
00:54:01.595 --> 00:54:03.485
That might leave her feeling rejected.

911
00:54:03.555 --> 00:54:07.485
That might leave her fitting less than not enough.

912
00:54:08.265 --> 00:54:09.325
See, those are guesses.

913
00:54:09.825 --> 00:54:14.725
That's exactly what we can do to try to understand

914
00:54:14.945 --> 00:54:18.885
and then let them correct us if we don't get it right.

915
00:54:20.965 --> 00:54:22.585
The word that the Lord gave me

916
00:54:22.645 --> 00:54:25.785
or brought to my mind as I was preparing to share

917
00:54:25.785 --> 00:54:28.585
with Joyce, my confession was crushed.

918
00:54:29.985 --> 00:54:31.025
I think it crushed you.

919
00:54:31.285 --> 00:54:33.785
Now, do y'all remember she beat my socks off in tennis?

920
00:54:35.045 --> 00:54:37.745
She not easily crushed. Okay?

921
00:54:38.645 --> 00:54:42.665
She is strong, enduring, persevering, determined.

922
00:54:43.845 --> 00:54:45.745
If you talk about my daddy, I'm not,

923
00:54:46.855 --> 00:54:48.105
Yeah, that would be a different

924
00:54:48.105 --> 00:54:49.345
topic entirely, wouldn't it?

925
00:54:50.365 --> 00:54:52.585
And there I had done the same thing her dad

926
00:54:52.885 --> 00:54:54.025
did in a different way.

927
00:54:54.245 --> 00:54:56.105
And it only took me a matter of weeks.

928
00:54:56.325 --> 00:54:58.705
It took him 16 years to leave the family.

929
00:54:59.885 --> 00:55:01.345
Are we starting to see connections?

930
00:55:01.395 --> 00:55:03.025
Everything doesn't have a connection

931
00:55:03.025 --> 00:55:04.985
to the past, but a lot of stuff does.

932
00:55:06.085 --> 00:55:08.905
So empathizing. Sounded like Joyce.

933
00:55:08.985 --> 00:55:09.985
I think that crushed you.

934
00:55:12.255 --> 00:55:15.575
Fourth thing, express care

935
00:55:16.635 --> 00:55:18.095
as part of the confession.

936
00:55:20.685 --> 00:55:24.975
I've already named it. I've owned it.

937
00:55:27.005 --> 00:55:29.815
I've described what I think it did to her

938
00:55:31.125 --> 00:55:35.335
with flexibility in case she wanted to say, yeah, it, it,

939
00:55:35.575 --> 00:55:38.455
I was feeling crushed and it was also making me,

940
00:55:38.875 --> 00:55:40.575
and then she might describe some more

941
00:55:40.875 --> 00:55:43.015
and I'd say, let her share that

942
00:55:43.835 --> 00:55:45.615
the best thing you can do is care

943
00:55:46.075 --> 00:55:49.895
for every word she says or he says.

944
00:55:50.675 --> 00:55:53.415
That's empathy. And then expressing, care cares.

945
00:55:55.015 --> 00:55:59.255
I am now Joyce feeling what for you?

946
00:55:59.875 --> 00:56:02.735
Sad compassion sorrow.

947
00:56:04.065 --> 00:56:06.245
Be careful to not go down the trail of saying,

948
00:56:06.385 --> 00:56:07.845
I'm now feeling like a jerk.

949
00:56:09.345 --> 00:56:11.605
I'm feeling so bad about,

950
00:56:11.885 --> 00:56:13.925
I don't know why you married me in the first place.

951
00:56:15.045 --> 00:56:17.005
I mean, I'm just lousy at that stuff.

952
00:56:17.305 --> 00:56:19.325
What's the problem with the words I just said?

953
00:56:19.435 --> 00:56:22.685
They're all selfish. They're all selfish. Or self-centered.

954
00:56:22.685 --> 00:56:24.085
Self-centered. Okay?

955
00:56:24.745 --> 00:56:27.365
And it takes the focus off of her heart

956
00:56:27.545 --> 00:56:28.925
and puts it over here on mine.

957
00:56:29.625 --> 00:56:32.645
And sometimes the person

958
00:56:32.745 --> 00:56:35.005
who should be receiving care is actually

959
00:56:35.005 --> 00:56:37.085
saying, oh, you're okay.

960
00:56:37.565 --> 00:56:38.605
I would've married you anyway.

961
00:56:38.905 --> 00:56:43.405
You know, they're rescuing you from your own shame.

962
00:56:44.225 --> 00:56:45.725
You know what I'm saying? Bad timing.

963
00:56:47.265 --> 00:56:49.405
So we definitely don't want to take it there.

964
00:56:49.585 --> 00:56:51.965
If we're the one confessing something, we don't want

965
00:56:51.965 --> 00:56:54.125
to distract it, make it about us.

966
00:56:54.715 --> 00:56:56.445
It's all about, I did something.

967
00:56:57.425 --> 00:57:01.765
I'm now realizing better than ever what that did to you.

968
00:57:02.265 --> 00:57:03.725
I'm telling you what I think it did.

969
00:57:03.905 --> 00:57:05.885
Please tell me more if there is more.

970
00:57:06.385 --> 00:57:07.485
And I'm gonna sit here

971
00:57:07.665 --> 00:57:09.925
and have compassion for everything I hear.

972
00:57:12.185 --> 00:57:13.645
And the other thing that I would tell you

973
00:57:13.675 --> 00:57:15.445
that I was not known

974
00:57:15.505 --> 00:57:20.505
for is I was weeping the whole time.

975
00:57:22.725 --> 00:57:23.725
Going? I was just gonna say, I've

976
00:57:23.725 --> 00:57:25.405
never had anyone cry for

977
00:57:25.405 --> 00:57:26.405
Me. Yeah.

978
00:57:26.405 --> 00:57:29.285
And I could not have made myself cry.

979
00:57:30.355 --> 00:57:32.445
That came freely. It doesn't always happen.

980
00:57:33.345 --> 00:57:35.245
But I trust my sincerity.

981
00:57:35.955 --> 00:57:39.325
Even if I don't have tears from eyes, as long

982
00:57:39.325 --> 00:57:41.925
as I know in my heart I'm being genuine, I'm being sincere.

983
00:57:41.985 --> 00:57:44.885
I'm caring for you, then that'll go,

984
00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:46.445
that'll, that'll be enough.

985
00:57:46.585 --> 00:57:50.085
But to have tears come to my eyes was just a testimony of,

986
00:57:50.265 --> 00:57:51.805
Ooh, we have not been here before.

987
00:57:52.315 --> 00:57:55.325
Does that make sense? So express care

988
00:57:57.305 --> 00:57:59.925
and five is ask for forgiveness.

989
00:58:03.185 --> 00:58:05.285
At the time we were taught this material,

990
00:58:08.225 --> 00:58:10.865
I had been through a lot of Christian training,

991
00:58:12.825 --> 00:58:14.745
biblical training and counselor training.

992
00:58:14.775 --> 00:58:19.505
That was Christian. And I had never heard anybody describe

993
00:58:20.355 --> 00:58:22.385
confession with those two things.

994
00:58:23.215 --> 00:58:24.665
Empathy and compassion.

995
00:58:25.045 --> 00:58:28.345
It was all about own it and make yourself accountable.

996
00:58:30.635 --> 00:58:32.985
Those two things are important. They're not sufficient.

997
00:58:33.015 --> 00:58:34.945
That is not what heals the heart.

998
00:58:35.765 --> 00:58:39.425
The heart, the hurt that's left behind is only healed

999
00:58:39.425 --> 00:58:41.545
through morning and comforting.

1000
00:58:42.565 --> 00:58:45.465
And the more we see that, the more we'll trust that

1001
00:58:45.465 --> 00:58:46.465
that's God's process.

1002
00:58:47.685 --> 00:58:49.705
Use it, use it, use it.

1003
00:58:50.775 --> 00:58:54.065
Plus there's a, there's a big part of the confession,

1004
00:58:54.065 --> 00:58:55.385
the one John one, nine.

1005
00:58:56.135 --> 00:58:59.345
Because if you truly believe you, he's taken that

1006
00:58:59.345 --> 00:59:00.985
to the Lord and being forgiven.

1007
00:59:01.005 --> 00:59:03.465
He can say, talk to me out of gratitude.

1008
00:59:04.695 --> 00:59:06.425
Talk. I'm sorry, say that he talked to

1009
00:59:06.425 --> 00:59:07.905
Me out of gratitude. Yeah.

1010
00:59:08.735 --> 00:59:12.985
Yeah. Because I have experienced a fresh touch

1011
00:59:13.085 --> 00:59:15.185
of God's grace when I pray to him.

1012
00:59:16.165 --> 00:59:19.825
And I, you know, if, if I'm getting, if

1013
00:59:19.825 --> 00:59:22.765
what I'm hearing is condemnation, it isn't coming from God.

1014
00:59:24.245 --> 00:59:25.845
'cause there is no condemnation for those

1015
00:59:25.865 --> 00:59:27.285
who are, who are in Christ Jesus.

1016
00:59:28.345 --> 00:59:30.845
I'm just gonna start these around that way. And over here.

1017
00:59:31.875 --> 00:59:33.445
Have a question. Yes.

1018
00:59:33.865 --> 00:59:36.805
Um, what's the difference between e

1019
00:59:37.105 --> 00:59:39.285
and express care The same to me.

1020
00:59:39.865 --> 00:59:41.365
Is it, is that important?

1021
00:59:41.615 --> 00:59:43.005
Sorry. My, my hearing

1022
00:59:43.025 --> 00:59:44.025
Aid. The difference

1023
00:59:44.025 --> 00:59:46.285
between empathize and express care.

1024
00:59:46.315 --> 00:59:47.365
Okay. They seem the

1025
00:59:47.365 --> 00:59:48.365
Same. Yeah.

1026
00:59:48.365 --> 00:59:52.725
Uh, empathy is you trying to understand

1027
00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:53.765
what they're feeling.

1028
00:59:54.155 --> 00:59:58.165
Okay. Expressing care is you telling them

1029
00:59:58.875 --> 01:00:00.685
what you're feeling for them.

1030
01:00:02.035 --> 01:00:04.125
This is you trying to understand.

1031
01:00:04.445 --> 01:00:06.805
I think when that happened, that crushed you.

1032
01:00:07.005 --> 01:00:09.525
I think that probably made you think

1033
01:00:09.525 --> 01:00:10.645
of your dad leaving her.

1034
01:00:11.765 --> 01:00:13.565
I think maybe you had thoughts

1035
01:00:13.565 --> 01:00:15.325
that maybe I'll never get married.

1036
01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.365
That's actually one thing Joyce said.

1037
01:00:17.535 --> 01:00:21.565
Maybe I'll never find somebody else that'll

1038
01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:22.685
be loving me.

1039
01:00:23.665 --> 01:00:25.805
She actually, that was a thought more than a feeling,

1040
01:00:25.985 --> 01:00:27.565
but it was very important thought.

1041
01:00:28.415 --> 01:00:31.645
Right? Does that help? Yeah.

1042
01:00:31.745 --> 01:00:35.285
So you're really trying, this one's about you trying

1043
01:00:35.485 --> 01:00:37.325
to understand and convey

1044
01:00:37.795 --> 01:00:41.165
what you think they failed.

1045
01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:43.685
I guarantee you that if that,

1046
01:00:43.715 --> 01:00:45.525
even if you're not right on track,

1047
01:00:46.025 --> 01:00:47.645
if you're anywhere in the ballpark,

1048
01:00:48.185 --> 01:00:50.325
that's providing something very needed

1049
01:00:50.905 --> 01:00:52.485
for the person who got hurt.

1050
01:00:54.915 --> 01:00:57.535
And when we got through to the end, uh,

1051
01:00:58.695 --> 01:01:00.975
I would've been shocked if Joyce wouldn't have forgiven me.

1052
01:01:01.135 --> 01:01:03.375
'cause I knew her heart and I knew her faith

1053
01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:04.735
faithfulness to the Lord.

1054
01:01:04.915 --> 01:01:09.055
And that she knows the verse that says, forgive one another

1055
01:01:09.055 --> 01:01:10.855
as God in Christ forgave you.

1056
01:01:11.315 --> 01:01:12.895
She believes and trusts all that.

1057
01:01:14.645 --> 01:01:17.265
So I wasn't surprised that she would forgive me.

1058
01:01:19.485 --> 01:01:22.745
And I felt certain also she won't use this as an opportunity

1059
01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:24.345
to just drag me over the coals.

1060
01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:29.185
Okay. Her job actually is to forgive.

1061
01:01:31.925 --> 01:01:33.745
But here's the first thing she said

1062
01:01:33.775 --> 01:01:35.785
that carried so much weight to me.

1063
01:01:35.885 --> 01:01:40.265
She actually said in that moment, after we both were crying,

1064
01:01:40.445 --> 01:01:43.825
and there's a good cry, there's healing in that.

1065
01:01:44.725 --> 01:01:47.145
And when we kind of gather ourselves, she said, you know,

1066
01:01:47.145 --> 01:01:50.785
for the first time in my life, a man has come to understand

1067
01:01:51.005 --> 01:01:52.625
how deeply I've been hurt.

1068
01:01:52.765 --> 01:01:55.905
Mm-Hmm. That's the empathy part of that.

1069
01:01:57.165 --> 01:01:59.305
And I used one word question.

1070
01:02:01.325 --> 01:02:03.625
The tears probably conveyed even more,

1071
01:02:03.885 --> 01:02:04.945
but it's not about,

1072
01:02:07.685 --> 01:02:09.385
uh, being long-winded.

1073
01:02:09.385 --> 01:02:13.265
That'll actually get in the way. Okay. Trust.

1074
01:02:15.045 --> 01:02:19.685
So back to a question raised earlier about what if

1075
01:02:20.575 --> 01:02:25.005
there hasn't been a whole lot of this awareness or empathy

1076
01:02:25.185 --> 01:02:27.925
or, uh, knowledge of how

1077
01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.405
things you do has hurt me.

1078
01:02:31.905 --> 01:02:34.405
We could say, number one, the Holy Spirit can be counted

1079
01:02:34.475 --> 01:02:37.485
upon to want to help with that

1080
01:02:37.665 --> 01:02:39.685
and to be trying to help you.

1081
01:02:40.355 --> 01:02:42.325
Okay? Um,

1082
01:02:43.465 --> 01:02:45.405
and I'd also say, go with what you got.

1083
01:02:45.705 --> 01:02:47.525
In other words, whatever comes to mind,

1084
01:02:47.535 --> 01:02:48.845
write it down and go with it.

1085
01:02:48.845 --> 01:02:51.325
Even if it doesn't turn out to be the biggest thing

1086
01:02:51.325 --> 01:02:54.845
that ever happened, or maybe the thing that they would list

1087
01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:59.285
I mentioned earlier, uh, when that was brought up,

1088
01:03:00.195 --> 01:03:02.365
that there's kind of a safety valve.

1089
01:03:03.425 --> 01:03:06.565
And it is this, usually we recommend that.

1090
01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:10.125
It's, what I think this homework recommends is take turns so

1091
01:03:10.125 --> 01:03:12.845
that one person doesn't get totally drained going

1092
01:03:12.845 --> 01:03:14.765
through everything without receiving any care.

1093
01:03:15.555 --> 01:03:19.445
Take turns. And so we started with this one.

1094
01:03:20.085 --> 01:03:21.725
I usually recommend guys go first.

1095
01:03:22.425 --> 01:03:23.485
We started with this one

1096
01:03:23.505 --> 01:03:26.085
and you heard the, the impact it had.

1097
01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:29.975
And then I would've probably done one or two more,

1098
01:03:30.075 --> 01:03:31.775
and then we would've switched off.

1099
01:03:32.435 --> 01:03:34.255
She would've shared some, which she did.

1100
01:03:35.835 --> 01:03:39.375
And, but let's just say I get down through my list of

1101
01:03:40.055 --> 01:03:42.815
whatever it is, seven, 10, or whatever.

1102
01:03:43.295 --> 01:03:46.135
A friend of mine had four pages of his confessions

1103
01:03:47.485 --> 01:03:48.855
That they'd been married about 20 years.

1104
01:03:48.965 --> 01:03:50.015
He'd stored up a bunch.

1105
01:03:51.555 --> 01:03:55.335
So when, when I get through all of these, then

1106
01:03:56.335 --> 01:03:59.615
I ask Joyce, is there anything I missed?

1107
01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:04.495
Okay, that'll, that'll make sure

1108
01:04:04.495 --> 01:04:07.015
that you don't leave a stone unturned

1109
01:04:07.045 --> 01:04:08.375
that really needs care.

1110
01:04:09.755 --> 01:04:12.135
But by then I trust your spouse would be saying,

1111
01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.655
you're doing so well.

1112
01:04:13.775 --> 01:04:14.895
I almost hate to bring it up.

1113
01:04:16.645 --> 01:04:18.815
Well, what's the verse about? Forgiving?

1114
01:04:18.935 --> 01:04:20.415
A multitude of sins.

1115
01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:22.575
A multitude of sins. It's

1116
01:04:22.575 --> 01:04:24.335
called, I can't think where it is. Love.

1117
01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:27.495
Love Covers. Love covers a multitude of sins.

1118
01:04:28.035 --> 01:04:31.535
And you got me stumped also, I don't know the reference for

1119
01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.015
that, but that's in there.

1120
01:04:33.405 --> 01:04:37.375
Okay. I'm not gonna bring up, go to Bible gateway. Okay.

1121
01:04:39.195 --> 01:04:43.295
So let me, uh, lemme just, uh,

1122
01:04:44.795 --> 01:04:46.135
see if we've got other questions.

1123
01:04:46.185 --> 01:04:48.015
First of all, at this point, I want

1124
01:04:48.015 --> 01:04:50.015
to talk about forgiveness for a few moments.

1125
01:04:50.275 --> 01:04:54.175
But any other questions about the confession part of this?

1126
01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:57.935
Both of you have your list. Yes.

1127
01:04:58.835 --> 01:05:01.935
Um, it seems like, you know, empathizing number three kind

1128
01:05:01.935 --> 01:05:03.175
of opens up a dialogue.

1129
01:05:03.995 --> 01:05:06.375
So are you, you know, when you're trying to,

1130
01:05:06.635 --> 01:05:10.295
to understand your wife, you're, you're asking her to share

1131
01:05:10.315 --> 01:05:11.455
how she felt in the moment,

1132
01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:14.175
and then you're responding to how she

1133
01:05:14.875 --> 01:05:16.335
is expressing her emotions

1134
01:05:17.025 --> 01:05:18.025
Issues. Great comment. Leah.

1135
01:05:18.025 --> 01:05:18.925
Let me take a

1136
01:05:18.925 --> 01:05:20.125
stab at responding to that.

1137
01:05:20.225 --> 01:05:22.885
And then you keep going with more if you want.

1138
01:05:23.915 --> 01:05:26.285
Will you highly recommend that you don't?

1139
01:05:26.715 --> 01:05:29.685
Like I say, I remember the time when I told you I changed my

1140
01:05:29.685 --> 01:05:30.765
mind about getting married.

1141
01:05:31.555 --> 01:05:35.525
That was wrong with me to do that. I think it crushed you.

1142
01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:39.485
So we, we'd say, don't, don't ask them what they felt

1143
01:05:39.615 --> 01:05:41.765
until you have said what you think they felt.

1144
01:05:42.515 --> 01:05:46.285
Because that'll carry so much value to your spouse

1145
01:05:46.795 --> 01:05:49.405
when they know you are already getting it

1146
01:05:50.235 --> 01:05:51.365
when you hadn't before.

1147
01:05:52.505 --> 01:05:55.045
So do try to say, I'm not sure,

1148
01:05:55.265 --> 01:05:57.485
but I think maybe it left you feeling crushed,

1149
01:05:57.665 --> 01:05:59.805
or I think it left you feeling betrayed.

1150
01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:02.485
Then say, is that right?

1151
01:06:04.605 --> 01:06:07.025
Or if they just start elaborating a little bit.

1152
01:06:07.055 --> 01:06:10.985
Does that make sense? So you don't want to rush past that.

1153
01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:13.745
Say, Nope, I got five things I'm going to finish.

1154
01:06:14.445 --> 01:06:16.745
No, that's, that's a place where you wanna say,

1155
01:06:16.865 --> 01:06:18.705
I think this is how it affected you.

1156
01:06:20.525 --> 01:06:22.185
And then give them an opportunity

1157
01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:26.905
or pause to tell you Yes,

1158
01:06:27.005 --> 01:06:28.105
that's exactly right.

1159
01:06:28.365 --> 01:06:31.595
Or I don't think it was crushed, but it,

1160
01:06:32.095 --> 01:06:33.115
but you're in the ballpark.

1161
01:06:33.275 --> 01:06:34.995
I think it was more. And then that's,

1162
01:06:35.255 --> 01:06:37.515
and then you just want to keep responding with, I,

1163
01:06:37.835 --> 01:06:39.035
I care about that also.

1164
01:06:39.135 --> 01:06:43.955
I'm so sorry. I really, really am hurting for you. Now.

1165
01:06:44.255 --> 01:06:45.915
See, I was blind for 19 years,

1166
01:06:46.455 --> 01:06:48.235
but what matters now is now

1167
01:06:50.155 --> 01:06:51.635
I can't change what happened.

1168
01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:54.315
Obviously I went back, proposed again.

1169
01:06:54.335 --> 01:06:55.835
She accepted again, we got married.

1170
01:06:56.495 --> 01:07:01.235
But that pain had never, never been addressed. Mm-Hmm.

1171
01:07:01.975 --> 01:07:03.475
It was buried deep within her.

1172
01:07:03.615 --> 01:07:05.435
She wasn't walking around thinking about it.

1173
01:07:05.735 --> 01:07:08.115
In fact, it, she did not even have it listed on

1174
01:07:08.115 --> 01:07:09.275
this side of her list.

1175
01:07:10.795 --> 01:07:12.755
I didn't think God could be that good to me.

1176
01:07:14.495 --> 01:07:15.915
So it did carry almost like,

1177
01:07:16.595 --> 01:07:18.755
I think God made sure you got that on there.

1178
01:07:19.705 --> 01:07:21.875
Okay. Does that help? Okay.

1179
01:07:22.065 --> 01:07:23.715
Cameron, I think you were gonna say

1180
01:07:23.715 --> 01:07:24.715
Something. Well, I was gonna, I was

1181
01:07:24.715 --> 01:07:26.435
gonna ask how do you know,

1182
01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:31.465
how do, how do you know to be careful with a subject

1183
01:07:31.495 --> 01:07:34.425
that maybe your wife's not ready to talk about yet?

1184
01:07:35.125 --> 01:07:37.825
Uh, like the especially painful things. But yeah.

1185
01:07:38.005 --> 01:07:39.065
But then I started thinking maybe

1186
01:07:39.065 --> 01:07:40.505
that's something that I ask her

1187
01:07:41.665 --> 01:07:42.665
Directly. Well, I think that's

1188
01:07:42.665 --> 01:07:45.585
probably what I would guide you to do,

1189
01:07:46.005 --> 01:07:50.585
is you could even lead into it by saying, this first thing

1190
01:07:50.585 --> 01:07:51.625
that came to my mind, or

1191
01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:52.825
one of the things that came to my mind.

1192
01:07:53.895 --> 01:07:58.635
Uh, I, I don't want to put you in a position

1193
01:07:58.635 --> 01:08:00.435
of having to talk about it if you don't.

1194
01:08:00.455 --> 01:08:03.235
So when I mentioned it, if you don't really want to me

1195
01:08:03.235 --> 01:08:06.355
to focus on that now, go ahead and tell me

1196
01:08:07.095 --> 01:08:08.595
and we'll save that for another day.

1197
01:08:09.895 --> 01:08:12.915
I'd highly recommend you take that approach rather than just

1198
01:08:14.065 --> 01:08:16.325
eliminate it yourself out of fear

1199
01:08:16.585 --> 01:08:19.365
or wondering.

1200
01:08:19.475 --> 01:08:23.045
Yeah. Yeah. You want to get, just say, I'm ready

1201
01:08:23.325 --> 01:08:24.605
whenever you're ready to talk about that.

1202
01:08:25.345 --> 01:08:27.965
But if you're bringing this, that's going to,

1203
01:08:28.175 --> 01:08:31.045
especially if there's already been some other things talked

1204
01:08:31.045 --> 01:08:34.165
about then that, that creates a lot

1205
01:08:34.165 --> 01:08:36.525
of safety when you start doing this.

1206
01:08:37.315 --> 01:08:40.125
Yeah. And, and it is less about like something like

1207
01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:42.685
current, more about just, I remember times in the past

1208
01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.005
where I've mishandled that

1209
01:08:44.065 --> 01:08:45.765
and I've brought up something Mm-Hmm.

1210
01:08:45.845 --> 01:08:49.765
And it came off more as me just dumping

1211
01:08:50.705 --> 01:08:53.045
Almost like, I want to get this off my chest. Yeah. Yeah.

1212
01:08:53.065 --> 01:08:54.725
That's why you take it to God first.

1213
01:08:55.555 --> 01:08:57.085
Yeah. Take it to God first

1214
01:08:57.145 --> 01:08:59.725
and then also check your own heart out.

1215
01:08:59.785 --> 01:09:04.405
You know, who is this for? Who am I bringing this list for?

1216
01:09:05.385 --> 01:09:09.165
And it is possible that I could feel guilty,

1217
01:09:11.775 --> 01:09:16.555
but what takes over that could be like that is I just,

1218
01:09:17.155 --> 01:09:18.755
I just want her to think well of me.

1219
01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:22.915
And if I don't, if I don't do this process they told us,

1220
01:09:22.915 --> 01:09:27.395
then I'm, you know, that, that might get me in the doghouse.

1221
01:09:27.775 --> 01:09:31.715
Now the goal for doing this is not

1222
01:09:31.815 --> 01:09:33.115
to secure forgiveness.

1223
01:09:35.215 --> 01:09:39.555
It is to bring healing to the pain that was left behind.

1224
01:09:40.735 --> 01:09:43.625
Does that make sense? Okay.

1225
01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:44.945
Let me cover a couple of things on

1226
01:09:44.945 --> 01:09:46.265
forgiveness and then we'll let you go.

1227
01:09:47.165 --> 01:09:48.545
Highly commend,

1228
01:09:52.045 --> 01:09:54.945
Try to have a time sometime during the next week

1229
01:09:55.355 --> 01:09:59.185
where you sit down and do at least two or three things.

1230
01:09:59.285 --> 01:10:01.745
You don't have to cover everything the first time.

1231
01:10:02.205 --> 01:10:04.105
If you get stuck, feel free.

1232
01:10:04.255 --> 01:10:06.225
Pull, pull us aside a, you know,

1233
01:10:06.515 --> 01:10:08.185
after class or something like that.

1234
01:10:08.365 --> 01:10:09.865
And, and we will give you a tip

1235
01:10:09.865 --> 01:10:13.025
or two to try to help you get off, off high center.

1236
01:10:13.165 --> 01:10:15.665
But, uh, it's usually kind of scary.

1237
01:10:15.765 --> 01:10:18.065
We were kind of scared doing it 'cause we'd never done it

1238
01:10:18.085 --> 01:10:20.625
and we didn't know for sure how well will that work.

1239
01:10:21.765 --> 01:10:25.705
And it is a process that is biblically defined and

1240
01:10:25.945 --> 01:10:27.425
therefore it will work.

1241
01:10:27.605 --> 01:10:30.105
But there could be other things that get in the way

1242
01:10:30.105 --> 01:10:31.545
that we aren't aware of.

1243
01:10:31.965 --> 01:10:34.225
And my parents who are strong Christians,

1244
01:10:34.775 --> 01:10:37.225
they had never demonstrated the way you

1245
01:10:38.175 --> 01:10:40.025
confessed your faults to somebody.

1246
01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:43.385
Yeah. Neither of us got that. Mm-Hmm. Right.

1247
01:10:43.445 --> 01:10:45.785
My mom was always right. My dad was wrong.

1248
01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:52.665
And for 16 years of your life,

1249
01:10:53.965 --> 01:10:55.105
he never said otherwise.

1250
01:10:55.165 --> 01:10:57.545
That's right. Yeah. Okay.

1251
01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:02.125
Forgiveness, uh, first of all, we're commanded to forgive,

1252
01:11:02.865 --> 01:11:07.185
but, uh, if you Offer forgiveness,

1253
01:11:07.365 --> 01:11:09.785
but you know in your heart you are still carrying

1254
01:11:09.835 --> 01:11:10.905
resentment, then

1255
01:11:11.055 --> 01:11:15.045
that is not real forgiveness.

1256
01:11:15.225 --> 01:11:17.765
Mm-Hmm. You're trying to check off the box.

1257
01:11:17.765 --> 01:11:19.045
You're trying to follow the rule,

1258
01:11:19.465 --> 01:11:20.925
but that's not necessarily forgiveness.

1259
01:11:22.225 --> 01:11:24.525
Um, what's usually there

1260
01:11:25.705 --> 01:11:29.685
in some degree is anger or resentment

1261
01:11:30.345 --> 01:11:33.125
or maybe even bitterness, depending upon what it is

1262
01:11:33.145 --> 01:11:36.525
and where, how it's, uh, come about.

1263
01:11:37.705 --> 01:11:40.965
But God clearly in Ephesians 4 31, 32 says,

1264
01:11:41.155 --> 01:11:42.285
forgive one another

1265
01:11:42.585 --> 01:11:45.725
as God in Christ forgave you forgive one another

1266
01:11:45.725 --> 01:11:47.125
as God in Christ forgave you.

1267
01:11:47.465 --> 01:11:51.205
One verse of that Ephesians 4 31

1268
01:11:51.585 --> 01:11:54.865
and 32, um,

1269
01:11:57.745 --> 01:11:59.385
actually I started in verse 32.

1270
01:11:59.525 --> 01:12:02.345
It says, put off anger, wrath

1271
01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:05.745
and malice becoming kind, tender hearted,

1272
01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:09.265
forgiving one another has God, Christ forgave you.

1273
01:12:09.405 --> 01:12:12.065
So see, it's really to talk about, have a heart change.

1274
01:12:13.165 --> 01:12:14.265
Now how can you do that?

1275
01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:18.265
How can you do that when someone's really treated you badly

1276
01:12:18.365 --> 01:12:19.505
and done wrong to you?

1277
01:12:20.255 --> 01:12:21.665
Hopefully that's not your spouse.

1278
01:12:21.825 --> 01:12:23.305
I just brought to mind, but somebody else.

1279
01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:24.585
But how do you do that?

1280
01:12:24.685 --> 01:12:27.705
And we'd say, the only reason or way we can do that is

1281
01:12:27.905 --> 01:12:29.025
'cause it was done for us.

1282
01:12:29.895 --> 01:12:33.785
It's like when God forgave me of being one

1283
01:12:33.965 --> 01:12:38.745
of billions who sent his son to die in my place,

1284
01:12:39.295 --> 01:12:43.865
when God forgave me, some

1285
01:12:43.865 --> 01:12:45.505
of his forgiveness came to me.

1286
01:12:45.725 --> 01:12:47.505
And it's like a spiritual commodity

1287
01:12:47.535 --> 01:12:49.305
that now I've got to share with others.

1288
01:12:50.645 --> 01:12:55.185
But some people have been even misled

1289
01:12:55.325 --> 01:12:56.585
by religious leaders

1290
01:12:57.175 --> 01:13:01.425
that they should forgive without the hurt tied

1291
01:13:01.565 --> 01:13:03.865
to the injury being healed.

1292
01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:08.265
And I wouldn't say it's impossible,

1293
01:13:08.365 --> 01:13:10.905
but I'd say that makes it really, really hard.

1294
01:13:10.965 --> 01:13:15.625
Mm-Hmm. So that's why this healing, confession,

1295
01:13:15.685 --> 01:13:19.465
caring confession is much more likely to produce some

1296
01:13:19.465 --> 01:13:22.145
of this healing that God's trying to bring about.

1297
01:13:22.845 --> 01:13:27.745
But when it comes to forgiveness, um, number one,

1298
01:13:27.965 --> 01:13:29.025
it is a command,

1299
01:13:30.565 --> 01:13:34.265
but it's commanded in a way that says that your heart needs

1300
01:13:34.265 --> 01:13:36.625
to be ready to release the

1301
01:13:37.275 --> 01:13:38.985
thing you have against the other person.

1302
01:13:41.205 --> 01:13:45.705
You can release it. That is not the same at forgiveness in

1303
01:13:45.705 --> 01:13:47.625
that sense is not the same as trust.

1304
01:13:48.805 --> 01:13:51.985
It does not say that I have to keep sub, um,

1305
01:13:53.055 --> 01:13:54.105
there's a word for it.

1306
01:13:54.195 --> 01:13:58.065
Sorry. I don't have to keep subjecting myself

1307
01:13:58.165 --> 01:14:02.635
or putting myself at risk such as if

1308
01:14:02.635 --> 01:14:04.155
that person's threatening my life

1309
01:14:04.215 --> 01:14:06.315
or threatening bodily harm, stuff like that.

1310
01:14:06.735 --> 01:14:08.995
No, no, no, no, no. It does not say that.

1311
01:14:10.745 --> 01:14:15.325
What it's saying is realize

1312
01:14:15.435 --> 01:14:19.405
that forgiving is not natural to our flesh.

1313
01:14:22.425 --> 01:14:24.725
We forgive because he forgave, he showed us.

1314
01:14:24.785 --> 01:14:25.965
That's what love looks like,

1315
01:14:26.225 --> 01:14:29.885
but a benefit to you as it gets your anger out of you.

1316
01:14:31.665 --> 01:14:33.805
And it's okay if you have to make boundaries.

1317
01:14:34.795 --> 01:14:37.085
Yeah. It's okay.

1318
01:14:37.915 --> 01:14:42.725
Yeah. That would be another step with a, in a situation

1319
01:14:42.725 --> 01:14:43.765
where it was not really safe.

1320
01:14:43.955 --> 01:14:45.205
Okay. So

1321
01:14:46.115 --> 01:14:49.365
I've always wondered in that We're running outta time.

1322
01:14:49.425 --> 01:14:51.445
So just be aware of that. Right.

1323
01:14:51.835 --> 01:14:54.485
Ephesians 4 32 says, be kind

1324
01:14:54.505 --> 01:14:57.965
and compassionate to one another, forgiving one another.

1325
01:14:58.465 --> 01:15:01.365
So if I've often wondered, do I have to be kind first

1326
01:15:02.145 --> 01:15:03.445
and show compassion

1327
01:15:03.905 --> 01:15:06.605
before I even have the ability to forgive?

1328
01:15:07.355 --> 01:15:10.165
Yeah. That, that would be that heart change. Yeah.

1329
01:15:10.165 --> 01:15:12.805
That's in that verse. Okay. Okay.

1330
01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:15.645
Forgiveness is a choice, not a feeling.

1331
01:15:16.385 --> 01:15:17.685
So that heart change is more

1332
01:15:17.685 --> 01:15:20.005
of an attitude towards the other person, not necessarily

1333
01:15:20.005 --> 01:15:21.885
that I just really can't wait to forgive you.

1334
01:15:23.505 --> 01:15:26.445
It, it may not be a feeling that's driving me,

1335
01:15:26.705 --> 01:15:28.565
but I think you'll have more of a peace.

1336
01:15:29.835 --> 01:15:33.045
Yeah. I forgive you. Okay.

1337
01:15:33.945 --> 01:15:38.885
So that's it for this week. That's a big assignment.

1338
01:15:39.065 --> 01:15:41.365
If you have already done it, we'd say way to go

1339
01:15:41.865 --> 01:15:46.285
and hopefully this reinforces the theology

1340
01:15:46.505 --> 01:15:48.965
and the heart of God underneath it.

1341
01:15:49.315 --> 01:15:52.765
Okay. So we look forward to seeing you next week.

1342
01:15:53.285 --> 01:15:54.885
I do not have a birthday next week,

1343
01:15:54.985 --> 01:15:56.605
so I'm not bringing goodies.

1344
01:15:56.965 --> 01:15:58.765
I mean, I'm not bringing, uh,

1345
01:15:59.025 --> 01:16:01.525
and by the way, if there are any more, uh,

1346
01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:04.085
started calling 'em muffins anymore.

1347
01:16:04.085 --> 01:16:06.205
Cupcakes out there and you

1348
01:16:06.505 --> 01:16:09.165
or your kids would like them.

1349
01:16:09.875 --> 01:16:14.565
Hate them, please. Okay. God bless y'all. Thank. Thank you.

1350
01:16:14.865 --> 01:16:16.085
You bet. Our pleasure.
