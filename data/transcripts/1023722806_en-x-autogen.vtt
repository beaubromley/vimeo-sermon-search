WEBVTT

1
00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:18.555
Well, praise God.

2
00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:21.275
What a blessing that is to see that happen, right?

3
00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:22.595
That's such a special thing.

4
00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:23.835
A lot of people put a lot of work into that.

5
00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:26.315
We're grateful for the opportunity to share together

6
00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:29.595
with the next generation, uh, and what worship means.

7
00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:31.795
And so if you're new to our church, we're grateful

8
00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.235
that you would take a step to be here today.

9
00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:35.995
Uh, we're thankful and would love to meet you.

12
00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:41.875
Love to meet you that way. Uh,

to see you as always as well.

15
00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:49.155
Couple things before we get into, uh, the word today.

16
00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.755
We have a women's night of worship

17
00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:53.275
and community coming this Friday.

18
00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:56.195
And so if that's for you, of course, uh,

19
00:00:56.395 --> 00:00:57.875
please take that step.

20
00:00:57.875 --> 00:00:59.035
They would love to connect with you

21
00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:01.515
and get you, uh, into a, a place

22
00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:03.795
of true community, uh, with other women.

23
00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:05.195
And so that's this Friday night.

24
00:01:05.335 --> 00:01:07.475
You can go on the app or online and sign up for that.

25
00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.835
Also, next Sunday members, we have a church family meeting

26
00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:14.235
where we take an intentional time to update you on all kinds

27
00:01:14.235 --> 00:01:16.275
of things happening within the life of our church.

28
00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:19.395
Things, new ministries, new members, uh,

29
00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.435
also construction updates, um,

30
00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:22.795
any other things that we'll talk about.

31
00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:25.195
Celebrate what God's done in the last few months

32
00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:27.395
and we'll try to answer a few of the questions

33
00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.075
that you've sent in over time.

34
00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:32.675
So make sure those things are on your calendar today, though

35
00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:36.715
we are picking up in our series through the book

36
00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:40.435
of one Samuel called He Shall Reign, where we're studying

37
00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:43.555
how Israel was looking for a king.

38
00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:46.035
They desired a king even though they already had one in God.

39
00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:48.195
They were looking for one on the earth.

40
00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:51.155
And how that longing got them in trouble in

41
00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:52.995
so many different ways.

42
00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:56.345
Where we'll be today in chapter 13,

43
00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:00.545
marks the official beginning of Saul's reign as

44
00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:02.585
that first king of Israel.

45
00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:06.185
But as we've seen of over the last few weeks,

46
00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:10.625
hinted at in the inauguration ceremony, even in the lead up

47
00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:14.625
to it, the anointing process, all that, almost immediately

48
00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:19.155
we learned that Saul failed to live up to the ideal

49
00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:22.155
of kingship, to the reality of

50
00:02:22.155 --> 00:02:24.235
what he should be in this covenant relationship

51
00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:25.555
with God and with his people.

52
00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.875
That's where we're gonna be starting off today.

53
00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:30.435
So if you're not there already, turn with me

54
00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:31.835
to First Samuel chapter 13.

55
00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.035
We're gonna walk through first the events

56
00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:36.875
of the narrative to begin with.

57
00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:39.435
Uh, we're just gonna take a look first at the events,

58
00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:43.235
witnessing the events that happened here in chapter 13,

59
00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:43.995
and then we're gonna get some

60
00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:45.035
principles coming back through it.

61
00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:47.875
But the events of the narrative,

62
00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:53.615
look first at just verse one of one Samuel 13,

63
00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:57.475
Saul lived for one year

64
00:02:57.475 --> 00:02:59.405
and then became king when he had reigned

65
00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:01.405
for two years over Israel.

66
00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:02.645
And I'm gonna stop there for a second.

67
00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:05.485
'cause that verse is really strongly debated.

68
00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:06.765
There's a lot of questions about it,

69
00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:08.365
how the timeline even works out.

70
00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:10.565
It's, it's a lot of questions.

71
00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:11.885
But, but in essence,

72
00:03:11.915 --> 00:03:15.085
what this verse is doing is just merely setting off the

73
00:03:15.805 --> 00:03:17.685
official beginning of his kingship.

74
00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:20.125
He's kind of been it for a little bit already,

75
00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:22.645
but this, this is really where it starts.

76
00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:27.045
He officially began to reign right here at the beginning

77
00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:29.205
of chapter 13, right?

78
00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:30.325
So Saul began to reign.

79
00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:33.005
That's the first thing we see here happening.

80
00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:35.805
Uh, now there may have been extended period of sanctioning

81
00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:37.125
by God, we don't really know.

82
00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:41.525
But what we know for sure now is when Saul is the king,

83
00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:45.775
this is when he could be fully assessed by

84
00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:47.255
how he does as the king, right?

85
00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:49.815
So before it was a little bit vague. Now we know.

86
00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:53.135
Alright, how does Saul do as the king,

87
00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:57.725
what was one of his first official acts as the king?

88
00:03:58.355 --> 00:03:59.685
Look at verses two and three.

89
00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:03.995
Saul chose 3000 men of Israel.

90
00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:07.875
2000 were with Saul and Mash and the hill country of Bethel

91
00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:09.835
and a thousand were with Jonathan

92
00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:11.955
and gibbon of Benjamin, the rest of the people.

93
00:04:11.955 --> 00:04:13.915
He sent home every man to his tent.

94
00:04:15.115 --> 00:04:17.115
Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines

95
00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:19.675
that was at Giba, and the Philistines heard of it.

96
00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:22.595
Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying,

97
00:04:22.735 --> 00:04:24.355
let the Hebrews hear.

98
00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:28.015
Now we see a new character show up. Who was this?

99
00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:29.615
Jonathan introduced here for the first

100
00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:31.255
time in the narrative.

101
00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:33.935
Well, Jonathan was Saul's son.

102
00:04:35.655 --> 00:04:39.475
He would've been next in line to be the king after Saul.

103
00:04:40.455 --> 00:04:44.715
And immediately we see him set up in contrast to Saul.

104
00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:47.605
'cause what we learned first here is

105
00:04:47.605 --> 00:04:49.405
that Jonathan decided to obey.

106
00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:54.835
Now obey what? Right. Jonathan decided to obey.

107
00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:59.275
What did he obey? Well, this is back in chapter 10.

108
00:05:00.415 --> 00:05:03.955
Samuel told Saul a few things that he needed

109
00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:05.595
to do as the king.

110
00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:09.755
Listen to this first Samuel 10, verses five through eight.

111
00:05:11.635 --> 00:05:13.135
Samuel says to Saul,

112
00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:15.575
after that, you shall come to Gith Elohim,

113
00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:16.575
which is also Giba.

114
00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:17.895
There's, there's a lot of different

115
00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:19.415
translations of that same place.

116
00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:22.375
You shall come there where there is a garrison

117
00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.255
of the Philistines there.

118
00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:26.335
As soon as you come to the city, you will meet a group

119
00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:28.575
of prophets coming down from the high place with harp,

120
00:05:28.575 --> 00:05:31.695
tambourine, flute, liar before them prophesying.

121
00:05:31.885 --> 00:05:33.815
Then the spirit of the Lord will rush upon you.

122
00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:36.375
You'll prophesy with them, be turned into another man.

123
00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:39.415
When these signs meet you, do what your hand finds

124
00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:41.615
to do for God is with you.

125
00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:44.375
Meaning attack the Philistines is what that phrase is.

126
00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:47.215
Then go down before me to gilgal

127
00:05:47.215 --> 00:05:50.375
and behold, I'm coming down to you to offer offerings

128
00:05:50.595 --> 00:05:52.295
to sacrifice peace offerings.

129
00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:55.415
Seven days. You shall wait until I come to you

130
00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:57.245
and show you what you shall do.

131
00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:02.245
But let's go back to what we just saw in chapter 13.

132
00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:05.245
Who was the one who initiated the attack on the Philistines?

133
00:06:06.305 --> 00:06:10.355
It was Jonathan. It wasn't Saul, it was Jonathan.

134
00:06:12.525 --> 00:06:15.585
So right away we see this little glimmer

135
00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:18.905
that Saul is not obeying what Samuel the prophet,

136
00:06:19.235 --> 00:06:20.625
God's prophet told him to do.

137
00:06:22.525 --> 00:06:25.285
'cause he hadn't done it, but Jonathan did.

138
00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:28.035
Well look what happens next.

139
00:06:28.095 --> 00:06:30.675
Verses four through seven of chapter 13,

140
00:06:33.255 --> 00:06:35.035
all Israel heard it said

141
00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:36.635
that Saul had defeated the Garris

142
00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:38.035
garrison of the Philistines.

143
00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:40.515
So Saul somehow gets credit for it, but Jonathan did it.

144
00:06:40.855 --> 00:06:43.795
And also that Israel had become a stench to the Philistines.

145
00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:47.435
That people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal

146
00:06:48.255 --> 00:06:50.355
and the Philistines Muster to fight with Israel.

147
00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:52.875
30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen

148
00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:56.035
and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude.

149
00:06:56.745 --> 00:06:59.995
They came up and encamped at mash in the east of Beth Haven.

150
00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:03.075
When the men of Israel saw they were in trouble

151
00:07:03.575 --> 00:07:05.235
for the people were hard pressed.

152
00:07:05.535 --> 00:07:08.475
The people hid themselves in caves and holes and in rocks

153
00:07:08.475 --> 00:07:12.435
and in tombs and in cisterns, some Hebrews crossed the Fords

154
00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:14.955
of the Jordan River to the land of Gad and Gilead

155
00:07:15.575 --> 00:07:17.075
and Saul was still at Gilgal

156
00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:20.155
and all the people followed him trembling.

157
00:07:22.255 --> 00:07:25.275
So naturally when the Philistines attacked

158
00:07:26.555 --> 00:07:27.535
or when the Philistines were

159
00:07:27.735 --> 00:07:28.815
attacked, everybody heard about it.

160
00:07:29.035 --> 00:07:31.495
The Philistines got a little upset that they were known

161
00:07:31.495 --> 00:07:32.695
to have lost this battle.

162
00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:35.255
So the rest of their army, just that little garrison,

163
00:07:35.295 --> 00:07:36.975
a few soldiers were defeated.

164
00:07:37.275 --> 00:07:38.735
The rest of the Philistine army said,

165
00:07:38.735 --> 00:07:39.975
all right, let's go to battle.

166
00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:45.315
And so they began this imminent threat again, Israel,

167
00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:47.755
just like before a number of times in one Samuel,

168
00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:49.595
they're faced with this threat

169
00:07:50.215 --> 00:07:52.235
of a massive army right up their doorstep.

170
00:07:53.985 --> 00:07:57.475
And how did they respond? Yet again?

171
00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:01.635
How did they respond? Israel continued to fear.

172
00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:06.465
You see that Israel continued to fear.

173
00:08:09.485 --> 00:08:11.065
It says they saw themselves in trouble.

174
00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:13.545
It says they saw themselves hard pressed.

175
00:08:13.595 --> 00:08:15.545
Those are words that just mean they're scared.

176
00:08:15.765 --> 00:08:17.185
And so they tried to play hide

177
00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:18.665
and seek in the mountains, right?

178
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.105
They were hiding in caves. They were hiding in holes.

179
00:08:21.495 --> 00:08:23.585
Some of them even ran away across the river.

180
00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:24.865
They were so scared.

181
00:08:25.365 --> 00:08:28.265
Not only that, the ones who stayed with Saul, it says,

182
00:08:28.265 --> 00:08:29.585
were trembling in terror.

183
00:08:33.235 --> 00:08:35.815
Israel was just as afraid as before.

184
00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:41.335
They had what they asked for.

185
00:08:42.545 --> 00:08:45.995
They had a king they could see go

186
00:08:45.995 --> 00:08:47.715
before them into battle.

187
00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:51.075
But nothing had changed. See that?

188
00:08:52.585 --> 00:08:54.315
They were still full of fear.

189
00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:59.565
I and that king that they had asked for.

190
00:08:59.925 --> 00:09:01.445
Remember that tall athletic guy

191
00:09:01.445 --> 00:09:02.965
that sure seemed like he was gonna be

192
00:09:02.965 --> 00:09:04.045
the king that they needed?

193
00:09:04.055 --> 00:09:07.495
Right? Again, almost immediately

194
00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:10.655
Saul decided to disobey.

195
00:09:12.495 --> 00:09:16.805
We already saw a hint of it, but here it's explicit.

196
00:09:16.985 --> 00:09:18.805
He decided to disobey.

197
00:09:21.505 --> 00:09:22.915
Look at verses eight through 12.

198
00:09:24.025 --> 00:09:25.285
You've, you know the context.

199
00:09:25.355 --> 00:09:27.645
They're in this threat right in front of them.

200
00:09:27.665 --> 00:09:32.205
And so verse eight, Saul waited seven days,

201
00:09:32.945 --> 00:09:34.325
the time appointed by Samuel,

202
00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:37.525
but Samuel did not come to Gilgal

203
00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:39.445
and the people were scattering from him.

204
00:09:39.505 --> 00:09:42.245
And so Saul said, bring the burn offering here

205
00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:43.325
to me and the peace offerings.

206
00:09:43.325 --> 00:09:48.175
And he offered. Saul offered the burn offering as soon

207
00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:49.895
as he had finished offering the burn offering.

208
00:09:49.915 --> 00:09:54.685
Behold Samuel came. Saul went out to meet him and greet him.

209
00:09:55.105 --> 00:09:56.565
Samuel said, what have you done?

210
00:09:58.475 --> 00:09:59.855
And Saul said, when I saw

211
00:09:59.855 --> 00:10:01.655
that the people were scattering from me

212
00:10:02.165 --> 00:10:04.335
that you did not come within the days appointed

213
00:10:04.755 --> 00:10:07.815
and that the Philistines had mustard at mash, I said,

214
00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:10.815
now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal,

215
00:10:10.975 --> 00:10:13.735
I have not sought the favor of the Lord.

216
00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:19.135
And so I forced myself and offered the burned offering.

217
00:10:21.935 --> 00:10:26.725
So what was going on here? Think back.

218
00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:30.845
Do you remember what Samuel the prophet had told Saul to do

219
00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:32.885
back in chapter 10?

220
00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:34.485
First he said, you need

221
00:10:34.485 --> 00:10:37.245
to attack the Philistine garrison in Giba.

222
00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:40.365
He didn't do that. But also remember he said this,

223
00:10:40.455 --> 00:10:45.405
verse eight of chapter 10, go down before me to Gilgal.

224
00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:48.205
Behold, I'm coming down to you to offer burnt offerings

225
00:10:48.205 --> 00:10:50.645
and sacrifice peace offerings seven days.

226
00:10:50.705 --> 00:10:52.765
You shall wait until I come to you

227
00:10:52.765 --> 00:10:54.085
and show you what you shall do.

228
00:10:57.915 --> 00:11:00.735
Now let's try to be fair to Saul.

229
00:11:01.685 --> 00:11:03.905
It, it seems like maybe Samuel was late.

230
00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:06.505
He didn't come in seven days.

231
00:11:07.365 --> 00:11:09.505
And so Saul wasn't wrong in doing what he did.

232
00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:11.065
Now there's a whole lot wrong with what he did

233
00:11:11.065 --> 00:11:13.425
because he was the king, not the priest or the prophet.

234
00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:14.825
He was the king and he crossed over

235
00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:15.985
the boundary there he shouldn't have.

236
00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:20.825
But clearly Saul was in the wrong as we read through this.

237
00:11:21.605 --> 00:11:22.905
But we gotta resolve the tension

238
00:11:22.905 --> 00:11:25.065
because somehow are, are we not being fair?

239
00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:26.185
Did Saul not have a chance?

240
00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:30.435
Well, let me ask you a math question first.

241
00:11:31.875 --> 00:11:34.535
How many hours are in seven days?

242
00:11:37.385 --> 00:11:39.335
Quick math, right? 168.

243
00:11:39.855 --> 00:11:42.735
168 hours are in one week, seven days.

244
00:11:44.845 --> 00:11:47.985
So most likely what happened here is that Saul waited

245
00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:50.625
probably about 166 hours,

246
00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:54.560
which sure feels like seven days, doesn't it?

247
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.815
And it's like, man, right here

248
00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:57.495
until Samuel's not showing up.

249
00:11:57.725 --> 00:11:58.895
It's not seven days though

250
00:12:00.265 --> 00:12:02.635
because did you remember what verse 10 said?

251
00:12:02.635 --> 00:12:05.195
What happened? As soon as he had finished

252
00:12:05.835 --> 00:12:07.715
offering the burn offering, Samuel showed up.

253
00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:10.395
So Samuel wasn't late.

254
00:12:10.545 --> 00:12:15.385
Saul just got a little bit impatient, didn't wait.

255
00:12:17.705 --> 00:12:19.605
So this is the context. Samuel shows up.

256
00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:20.685
What did Saul do you remember?

257
00:12:22.015 --> 00:12:24.155
He went out almost like nothing was wrong.

258
00:12:24.155 --> 00:12:27.235
Went out to greet Samuel. Hey, welcome, good to see you.

259
00:12:28.495 --> 00:12:30.515
But immediately did you see how defensive he got?

260
00:12:31.865 --> 00:12:33.355
Saul got really defensive as soon

261
00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:35.435
as Samuel started asking a question here.

262
00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:38.875
And almost exactly, this is what's so fun about the Bible.

263
00:12:38.935 --> 00:12:40.395
Almost exactly like Adam

264
00:12:40.415 --> 00:12:43.675
and Eve did back in the garden in Genesis three,

265
00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:45.955
Saul started blaming everybody else.

266
00:12:48.525 --> 00:12:52.065
Hey Samuel, listen, my army was starting to to take off.

267
00:12:52.065 --> 00:12:55.955
They were running away. You were late Samuel

268
00:12:58.165 --> 00:12:59.385
man, look at the Philistine army.

269
00:12:59.385 --> 00:13:00.985
They're right here at our doorstep.

270
00:13:01.035 --> 00:13:04.065
Don't you know like he starts to blame everybody else

271
00:13:04.255 --> 00:13:05.745
that he didn't do anything wrong.

272
00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:10.295
It was all their fault. In fact, did you see how he said it?

273
00:13:10.815 --> 00:13:14.095
I had to do it. I forced myself to do it.

274
00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:16.415
I had no other choice.

275
00:13:19.335 --> 00:13:21.955
But everything Saul did was disobedience.

276
00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:24.915
Here he failed to trust the Lord

277
00:13:25.735 --> 00:13:30.435
by waiting on the Lord, which led him

278
00:13:30.535 --> 00:13:32.915
to fail to obey the Lord,

279
00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:41.015
which then led to tragically God's judgment

280
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:45.615
in seeking to replace Saul as the king,

281
00:13:47.585 --> 00:13:50.205
God sought to replace Saul.

282
00:13:54.715 --> 00:13:55.765
Look at verse 13.

283
00:13:57.155 --> 00:13:59.485
Down through the first part of verse 15,

284
00:14:02.685 --> 00:14:05.775
Saul had just finished trying to explain himself.

285
00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:10.175
Verse 13, and Samuel said to Saul, you have done foolishly,

286
00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:13.805
you have not kept the command of the Lord your God

287
00:14:14.315 --> 00:14:15.565
with which he commanded you

288
00:14:16.305 --> 00:14:18.405
for then the Lord would've established your

289
00:14:18.405 --> 00:14:19.805
kingdom over Israel forever.

290
00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:22.445
But now your kingdom shall not continue.

291
00:14:23.385 --> 00:14:26.325
The Lord has sought out a man after his own heart

292
00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.565
and the Lord has commanded him to be prince

293
00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:30.045
or leader over his people

294
00:14:30.195 --> 00:14:33.605
because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you.

295
00:14:34.885 --> 00:14:37.105
Samuel Rose went up from Gilgal, the rest

296
00:14:37.105 --> 00:14:38.945
of the people went up after Saul to meet the army.

297
00:14:39.415 --> 00:14:41.185
They went up from Gilgal to gibbon

298
00:14:41.485 --> 00:14:43.025
of Benjamin and the and the battle.

299
00:14:43.035 --> 00:14:44.545
We'll continue, we'll see over the next

300
00:14:45.165 --> 00:14:46.705
few weeks this battle.

301
00:14:46.805 --> 00:14:48.105
But but you see it here, right?

302
00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:52.140
In other words, what Samuel says is like, Hey Saul, listen,

303
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.925
because of your disobedience,

304
00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:56.645
because you are not a man seeking

305
00:14:56.655 --> 00:14:58.085
after God's heart,

306
00:14:58.515 --> 00:15:02.125
your family will not carry on the lineage of kingship.

307
00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:07.655
Remember Jonathan, his son seemed like a viable candidate.

308
00:15:07.655 --> 00:15:10.575
In fact, over the next couple weeks we'll see Jonathan show,

309
00:15:10.665 --> 00:15:13.055
great valor and great honor

310
00:15:13.115 --> 00:15:15.855
and he's an incredible man, would've made a great king.

311
00:15:16.155 --> 00:15:19.445
But the judgment was

312
00:15:19.445 --> 00:15:23.365
that the king will not come from Saul's family anymore.

313
00:15:24.765 --> 00:15:27.105
That's how it worked. Kings would pass it on

314
00:15:27.105 --> 00:15:28.705
to their oldest child,

315
00:15:28.725 --> 00:15:32.255
but not Saul's family anymore.

316
00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:35.905
And at this point in the narrative,

317
00:15:35.905 --> 00:15:37.145
we're not sure who that would be yet.

318
00:15:37.855 --> 00:15:39.785
Like we don't know. We don't have any idea.

319
00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:43.065
We just know it's not gonna be Saul's family when he dies.

320
00:15:43.495 --> 00:15:44.825
It's somebody else's family.

321
00:15:48.605 --> 00:15:49.875
We've seen this coming, haven't we?

322
00:15:52.465 --> 00:15:55.155
We've seen this in that,

323
00:15:55.185 --> 00:15:57.715
that Saul was from the wrong tribe to begin with.

324
00:15:59.645 --> 00:16:02.595
We've seen this in that he was acting often more

325
00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:03.835
like a judge than a king.

326
00:16:06.435 --> 00:16:08.965
Even their request for a king was wrong

327
00:16:09.025 --> 00:16:10.085
to begin with, right?

328
00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:13.285
So this whole thing we've seen has been set up

329
00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:17.035
and it should not be surprising to us

330
00:16:17.705 --> 00:16:19.435
that Saul failed at what he did.

331
00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:22.645
It. It's a little bit shocking

332
00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:23.645
that it happened this quickly,

333
00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:27.345
but it should not be surprising.

334
00:16:27.645 --> 00:16:29.465
We pretty much knew this was coming, right?

335
00:16:32.505 --> 00:16:35.335
Which again, we've talked about this already, that yes,

336
00:16:35.335 --> 00:16:36.855
there will be more in the story

337
00:16:36.855 --> 00:16:39.495
and we'll see God provide as he graciously does.

338
00:16:39.595 --> 00:16:44.055
But really the point in the whole thing of one Samuel is

339
00:16:44.055 --> 00:16:47.535
that this all should point us forward to a perfect

340
00:16:48.195 --> 00:16:52.535
and forever king Messiah, Jesus, that we know him

341
00:16:52.535 --> 00:16:54.065
to be right.

342
00:16:54.135 --> 00:16:56.025
This is just a failure on so many fronts

343
00:16:56.025 --> 00:16:58.665
and we, we can rest there.

344
00:17:01.295 --> 00:17:03.075
But for now at this point in the

345
00:17:03.075 --> 00:17:04.115
narrative, this is where we're at.

346
00:17:04.695 --> 00:17:06.395
All we know is that Saul is the king,

347
00:17:06.395 --> 00:17:07.555
but he's not gonna be the king forever

348
00:17:07.575 --> 00:17:09.475
and his family's not gonna continue doing it.

349
00:17:09.905 --> 00:17:12.115
What do we do next? We'll see as we go forward.

350
00:17:15.005 --> 00:17:16.025
But what do we learn from this?

351
00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:20.345
What do we learn from this passage specifically?

352
00:17:20.345 --> 00:17:23.505
Like how can we apply some of these principles

353
00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:27.415
into our lives to help us today?

354
00:17:27.415 --> 00:17:31.895
What do we learn from this section that will point us to

355
00:17:31.895 --> 00:17:36.655
that savior and point us to some change in our own lives?

356
00:17:39.175 --> 00:17:40.385
Well, here's the first principle.

357
00:17:42.335 --> 00:17:47.025
It's that no other king provides what I long for.

358
00:17:48.945 --> 00:17:50.965
And again, notice king is in quotes.

359
00:17:50.965 --> 00:17:53.045
We've done that the whole series

360
00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:55.045
because there is only one true king

361
00:17:56.455 --> 00:18:01.315
and no other king will ever provide What I long for,

362
00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:07.655
we've seen it throughout the book already, this concept

363
00:18:07.685 --> 00:18:12.015
that anytime you and I look for a replacement king

364
00:18:12.235 --> 00:18:16.765
or a replacement savior, it never comes through for us.

365
00:18:19.285 --> 00:18:20.985
It always ends badly.

366
00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:26.405
Isn't it ironic here though,

367
00:18:28.365 --> 00:18:29.655
like rain on your wedding day

368
00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:33.695
or free ride when you've already paid

369
00:18:34.835 --> 00:18:37.055
or traffic jam when you're already late?

370
00:18:38.225 --> 00:18:40.815
Which by the way, none of those are actually examples

371
00:18:40.815 --> 00:18:44.335
of irony, which is even better

372
00:18:44.335 --> 00:18:46.615
because that's what makes this song ironic anyway,

373
00:18:46.755 --> 00:18:48.095
if you're not like 40

374
00:18:48.095 --> 00:18:49.095
and older, you have no idea what

375
00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:49.855
I'm talking about right now.

376
00:18:49.965 --> 00:18:54.285
Okay? That's

377
00:18:54.365 --> 00:18:55.485
all gonna be in your head all day.

378
00:18:55.485 --> 00:18:59.725
Now that song I know, but this is irony here.

379
00:19:00.615 --> 00:19:02.825
This is ironic what happens right here.

380
00:19:03.165 --> 00:19:04.185
The reason, remember this,

381
00:19:04.325 --> 00:19:08.025
the reason Israel wanted a king in the first place was

382
00:19:08.045 --> 00:19:12.725
to protect them so that they would feel safe and secure.

383
00:19:12.835 --> 00:19:15.005
Like all the nations around them had their kings

384
00:19:15.005 --> 00:19:16.005
and they were safe and secure.

385
00:19:16.145 --> 00:19:18.285
We need a king. So we feel safe and secure.

386
00:19:18.705 --> 00:19:20.725
Now, they had a king named Saul.

387
00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:24.005
Yet the moment this massive Philistine army showed

388
00:19:24.025 --> 00:19:25.285
up, how did they respond?

389
00:19:25.555 --> 00:19:28.715
They were terrified. You see that

390
00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:34.515
just like before when they didn't have an earthly king,

391
00:19:34.705 --> 00:19:36.515
they were trembling, they were afraid.

392
00:19:37.095 --> 00:19:40.755
That's irony what they wanted and they had it.

393
00:19:41.015 --> 00:19:43.275
Now they were still the same like they were before.

394
00:19:43.335 --> 00:19:44.835
You see what God is teaching us here?

395
00:19:48.505 --> 00:19:51.275
Like anytime again we look for a replacement king

396
00:19:51.335 --> 00:19:54.435
or a replacement savior, it never satisfies,

397
00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:56.235
it never comes through for us.

398
00:19:59.245 --> 00:20:01.025
God had proven to Israel over

399
00:20:01.285 --> 00:20:04.345
and over again that if they would just trust him,

400
00:20:04.645 --> 00:20:06.705
if they would just let him fight the battles

401
00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.265
for them, it'd all work out.

402
00:20:09.665 --> 00:20:11.595
They, he'd shown them multiple times.

403
00:20:11.875 --> 00:20:13.955
Remember the ark floating around through all the Philistine

404
00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:15.915
and they, they did no ability to

405
00:20:16.425 --> 00:20:17.875
have any good come in their life.

406
00:20:17.905 --> 00:20:20.715
They were getting plagues, they were getting death

407
00:20:20.815 --> 00:20:21.875
to their gods.

408
00:20:21.875 --> 00:20:23.315
All this stuff was happening. The

409
00:20:23.315 --> 00:20:24.635
Israelis had nothing to do with it.

410
00:20:25.945 --> 00:20:28.575
God's like, don't you remember Exodus? Don't you?

411
00:20:28.745 --> 00:20:29.815
Don't you remember this stuff?

412
00:20:31.585 --> 00:20:33.045
If you just trust me, you let me fight

413
00:20:33.045 --> 00:20:34.165
the battles, it's all gonna be good.

414
00:20:34.185 --> 00:20:36.485
But instead what they do, they trust themselves.

415
00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:39.735
They trusted the means of the world.

416
00:20:43.405 --> 00:20:48.285
And what happened? Everything started to go off track.

417
00:20:50.865 --> 00:20:53.525
Listen, lemme give you a little glimpse

418
00:20:54.555 --> 00:20:55.765
into the enemy's playbook.

419
00:20:57.735 --> 00:20:59.315
You know in sports you have a playbook

420
00:20:59.415 --> 00:21:01.635
and you guard that very securely.

421
00:21:01.755 --> 00:21:03.955
'cause if, if that falls into the opponent's hands,

422
00:21:03.955 --> 00:21:05.115
then they know all your plays

423
00:21:05.135 --> 00:21:07.115
and you have no ability to beat them.

424
00:21:07.965 --> 00:21:09.915
Lemme give you a little glimpse into the enemy

425
00:21:09.915 --> 00:21:11.235
of our soul's playbook.

426
00:21:14.115 --> 00:21:17.575
He always over promises and under delivers.

427
00:21:20.935 --> 00:21:24.215
Every single time he over promises

428
00:21:24.795 --> 00:21:26.295
and under delivers,

429
00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:32.545
he will dangle something shiny and beautiful in front of me.

430
00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:36.065
But when I actually take the bait, it turns out

431
00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:37.705
to be fools gold.

432
00:21:38.865 --> 00:21:42.755
You know what that is, right? Fools gold.

433
00:21:43.415 --> 00:21:44.995
It sure looks like gold,

434
00:21:45.995 --> 00:21:48.695
but it's actually a min, a mineral called pyrite

435
00:21:50.255 --> 00:21:53.755
and it sure looks like it should be worth a lot.

436
00:21:53.815 --> 00:21:55.915
But you scratch the surface of that stuff off

437
00:21:55.975 --> 00:21:58.755
and it's just a hunk of nasty BlackRock underneath.

438
00:22:01.005 --> 00:22:05.195
That's what the enemy does. That's his mo.

439
00:22:05.195 --> 00:22:09.875
That's what he does. And it happens to us every single day.

440
00:22:10.145 --> 00:22:13.515
That enemy of our souls has so many lures.

441
00:22:15.575 --> 00:22:19.885
He's a really good fisherman because he's watched you and me

442
00:22:19.885 --> 00:22:21.205
and he's watched humanity

443
00:22:21.505 --> 00:22:23.205
for thousands and thousands of years.

444
00:22:23.265 --> 00:22:27.175
He knows what works. He knows what gets to us.

445
00:22:27.515 --> 00:22:30.855
He knows how it looks. He knows what works on me.

446
00:22:30.955 --> 00:22:33.135
He knows what works on you. He's watched us.

447
00:22:33.195 --> 00:22:36.015
And so he lies to you and tosses that out there

448
00:22:36.275 --> 00:22:37.935
and always over promises,

449
00:22:38.275 --> 00:22:39.255
but under delivers,

450
00:22:42.805 --> 00:22:43.665
he lies to you.

451
00:22:44.785 --> 00:22:48.315
That binging that show on Netflix will finally give you

452
00:22:48.315 --> 00:22:50.555
that joy hold that you've been longing to have filled.

453
00:22:50.575 --> 00:22:54.235
It finally will fill that when in reality you end up really

454
00:22:54.745 --> 00:22:56.795
exhausted and bitter about the time

455
00:22:56.815 --> 00:22:58.035
you just wasted doing that.

456
00:23:03.145 --> 00:23:06.645
He lies to you that making more money will set your kids

457
00:23:06.665 --> 00:23:07.685
up for success.

458
00:23:08.115 --> 00:23:09.205
When in reality they just

459
00:23:09.205 --> 00:23:10.525
resent you 'cause you're gone too much.

460
00:23:16.305 --> 00:23:17.805
He lies to you. That ending

461
00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:21.205
that pregnancy will keep your life on track.

462
00:23:22.255 --> 00:23:25.345
When in reality you have to carry that shame very quietly.

463
00:23:25.365 --> 00:23:26.985
He tells you the rest of your life,

464
00:23:32.165 --> 00:23:33.905
He lies to us this time of year.

465
00:23:34.005 --> 00:23:37.145
He lies to us that getting your candidate elected will solve

466
00:23:37.365 --> 00:23:38.705
all the nation's problems.

467
00:23:38.705 --> 00:23:41.225
When in reality you start trading more freedoms

468
00:23:41.565 --> 00:23:42.225
to get it

469
00:23:42.225 --> 00:23:47.025
elected and on and on.

470
00:23:47.085 --> 00:23:48.185
We could go right?

471
00:23:49.445 --> 00:23:52.945
So many things that the enemy over promises

472
00:23:53.125 --> 00:23:55.225
and you take the bait and he under delivers.

473
00:23:57.025 --> 00:23:59.275
It's a bait and switch. He'll pull the rug out from you

474
00:23:59.335 --> 00:24:00.955
as soon as you venture into it.

475
00:24:01.265 --> 00:24:03.035
I've seen it too many times in my own life

476
00:24:03.035 --> 00:24:06.595
where I wander into what I think will fulfill me.

477
00:24:06.815 --> 00:24:09.875
And what it ends up doing is the enemy is seeking to kill

478
00:24:09.935 --> 00:24:12.775
and destroy and he does it.

479
00:24:18.045 --> 00:24:20.705
So I want us to read that phrase out loud again together.

480
00:24:22.075 --> 00:24:23.475
I think, I think just

481
00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:26.035
to solidify it into our brains and our hearts.

482
00:24:26.425 --> 00:24:28.755
That point that that we have for this one,

483
00:24:29.265 --> 00:24:31.075
just let's just read it out loud together.

484
00:24:31.075 --> 00:24:33.035
Something with something about saying it out loud

485
00:24:33.645 --> 00:24:36.755
might help us understand better.

486
00:24:36.855 --> 00:24:41.075
So let's read this together that no other king

487
00:24:41.715 --> 00:24:43.275
provides what I long for.

488
00:24:44.095 --> 00:24:47.965
Let's do it again. No other king provides

489
00:24:48.075 --> 00:24:49.165
what I long for.

490
00:24:52.595 --> 00:24:57.325
Do I believe that? Do we

491
00:24:57.325 --> 00:24:58.525
be, do we believe that?

492
00:24:58.525 --> 00:25:01.285
Like, like we've seen that reality daily, right?

493
00:25:01.315 --> 00:25:03.725
Like I've seen it even this week in my own life.

494
00:25:03.725 --> 00:25:06.765
Like we, we see it. But do we believe that?

495
00:25:07.385 --> 00:25:09.095
Do we believe it enough

496
00:25:12.425 --> 00:25:13.605
to do something about it?

497
00:25:16.355 --> 00:25:18.135
To change even some day-to-day

498
00:25:18.415 --> 00:25:19.615
decisions we make in our lives?

499
00:25:19.675 --> 00:25:20.695
Do we believe that enough

500
00:25:24.125 --> 00:25:25.865
or do we keep going back to that lure

501
00:25:26.085 --> 00:25:27.625
and that bait over and over again?

502
00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:33.505
That's why the next principle here is so critical.

503
00:25:35.125 --> 00:25:38.075
We've witnessed Saul fail at this miserably.

504
00:25:40.435 --> 00:25:41.655
The principle is that

505
00:25:41.655 --> 00:25:44.455
what pleases the Lord is my love and obedience.

506
00:25:47.695 --> 00:25:49.305
When you look at what we've seen

507
00:25:49.325 --> 00:25:52.945
and learned here, it's not, it's not my stature,

508
00:25:53.495 --> 00:25:54.945
it's not my reputation.

509
00:25:56.475 --> 00:25:57.765
It's not just what I say.

510
00:25:58.115 --> 00:26:02.485
It's not even my religious acts and my religious beliefs.

511
00:26:03.075 --> 00:26:07.285
What pleases the Lord is my love and obedience.

512
00:26:11.505 --> 00:26:14.045
And and the interesting thing about one Samuel 13 is

513
00:26:14.045 --> 00:26:17.405
that it goes way deeper than just Saul disobeying

514
00:26:17.405 --> 00:26:18.805
what Saul Samuel told him to do.

515
00:26:21.005 --> 00:26:23.885
'cause look at verse 12 again, one Samuel 13 verse 12.

516
00:26:24.715 --> 00:26:28.805
What did Saul say to Samuel when he was confronted?

517
00:26:31.685 --> 00:26:34.535
Saul said, now the Philistines will come down against me at

518
00:26:34.595 --> 00:26:38.255
Gilgal, I have not sought the favor of the Lord.

519
00:26:38.795 --> 00:26:41.335
So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering.

520
00:26:44.575 --> 00:26:45.875
Now that could be a positive,

521
00:26:47.655 --> 00:26:49.475
but when you take it in the hole,

522
00:26:49.985 --> 00:26:51.315
there's a condemnation here.

523
00:26:53.245 --> 00:26:56.495
Because the way the narrative reads makes it seem like Saul,

524
00:26:56.845 --> 00:27:00.495
what he did there with the offering, what it was, was more

525
00:27:00.515 --> 00:27:03.015
of a superstitious act of

526
00:27:04.165 --> 00:27:06.415
sorcery than a true act of worship.

527
00:27:10.285 --> 00:27:14.505
It was like he was trying to appease some other God,

528
00:27:14.815 --> 00:27:16.385
like all the nations around them.

529
00:27:16.385 --> 00:27:17.385
Were doing all the time.

530
00:27:17.575 --> 00:27:19.065
He's tossing here in food here

531
00:27:19.065 --> 00:27:20.625
and gotta do this right and that right?

532
00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:22.785
And that's what all the other nations did to try

533
00:27:22.785 --> 00:27:25.105
to appease their false gods.

534
00:27:25.285 --> 00:27:28.825
He was doing the same thing with Yahweh,

535
00:27:32.305 --> 00:27:34.295
which means it wasn't true faith, right?

536
00:27:38.195 --> 00:27:40.565
It's what two Timothy three, five describes

537
00:27:40.585 --> 00:27:45.285
as having the appearance of godliness but denying its power.

538
00:27:48.535 --> 00:27:50.875
It, it sure looks like good, right?

539
00:27:51.285 --> 00:27:53.915
Godly things, but it's not at all.

540
00:27:56.635 --> 00:27:58.935
Saul's action had the appearance of faith,

541
00:27:59.235 --> 00:28:01.895
but it was not authentic faith.

542
00:28:03.075 --> 00:28:06.175
He did the act, he did the thing probably even wrongly

543
00:28:06.295 --> 00:28:07.495
'cause he wasn't a priest or a prophet.

544
00:28:07.635 --> 00:28:10.215
He did the act, but he didn't do it for the right reason

545
00:28:10.515 --> 00:28:12.175
or he didn't do it with the right heart.

546
00:28:12.435 --> 00:28:14.895
He didn't do it because he loved God at all.

547
00:28:17.145 --> 00:28:19.925
He did it because he felt like he had to to win a battle.

548
00:28:23.385 --> 00:28:28.295
And how did God respond to that? Saul rejected.

549
00:28:29.205 --> 00:28:31.695
Saul was rejected from the kingship.

550
00:28:32.565 --> 00:28:34.705
The rest of his family would not get to participate.

551
00:28:34.965 --> 00:28:36.945
God rejected Saul's kingship.

552
00:28:37.105 --> 00:28:39.585
'cause remember, Israel was not just supposed

553
00:28:39.585 --> 00:28:41.025
to be a monarchy like everybody else.

554
00:28:41.325 --> 00:28:44.545
Israel was supposed to be a theocratic monarchy

555
00:28:44.635 --> 00:28:49.585
where God is the full and complete king.

556
00:28:49.885 --> 00:28:53.185
And the king on earth was to fully depend on the God o

557
00:28:53.185 --> 00:28:56.105
of the universe, to depend on him, to follow him,

558
00:28:56.165 --> 00:28:59.145
to obey him, to believe him, to pursue him.

559
00:28:59.335 --> 00:29:01.185
That was the king's job on earth.

560
00:29:01.445 --> 00:29:03.505
And Saul did not do it

561
00:29:03.505 --> 00:29:05.225
because without that kind

562
00:29:05.225 --> 00:29:08.985
of heart towards God, the kingship wouldn't work.

563
00:29:10.495 --> 00:29:12.515
If the king did not depend on God,

564
00:29:12.575 --> 00:29:13.915
if the king did not follow God,

565
00:29:13.915 --> 00:29:15.875
if the king was only worried about himself,

566
00:29:15.945 --> 00:29:17.835
even if the king does the right actions,

567
00:29:19.095 --> 00:29:20.515
the Lord would not accept it.

568
00:29:24.365 --> 00:29:26.425
You see how relevant this is for our hearts today.

569
00:29:30.415 --> 00:29:33.865
Like I, I see how quickly this can happen in my own life

570
00:29:33.865 --> 00:29:37.065
where I slip into mere religious activities.

571
00:29:38.025 --> 00:29:42.995
I I do things because I know it's right,

572
00:29:48.355 --> 00:29:53.015
yet not really have a motivation of love for God as I do it.

573
00:29:58.425 --> 00:30:01.925
Listen, God doesn't just want obedience

574
00:30:02.225 --> 00:30:03.765
for the sake of obedience.

575
00:30:04.475 --> 00:30:07.585
Like of course He calls us to obey.

576
00:30:07.615 --> 00:30:09.985
It's good for us to obey his word,

577
00:30:10.005 --> 00:30:11.865
to choose holiness over sin.

578
00:30:12.345 --> 00:30:13.505
Absolutely. That is right.

579
00:30:16.895 --> 00:30:21.365
But he wants our love. He wants our allegiance to him.

580
00:30:24.075 --> 00:30:28.575
He wants us to want to draw near to him, to want to sing

581
00:30:28.575 --> 00:30:32.775
to him, to want to give sacrificially to him, to want

582
00:30:32.795 --> 00:30:34.775
to gather with other believers like this.

583
00:30:34.995 --> 00:30:37.295
Not because we have to do any of those things.

584
00:30:37.475 --> 00:30:40.415
And it's because we get to do those things. Amen. Right?

585
00:30:40.415 --> 00:30:43.295
That's the difference here. Whatcha doing on Sunday?

586
00:30:43.315 --> 00:30:46.595
Oh, I gotta go to church. Whoa.

587
00:30:46.925 --> 00:30:49.995
Where like you see the heart thing, I get to go be

588
00:30:49.995 --> 00:30:52.035
with my brothers and sisters on Sunday morning, right?

589
00:30:52.875 --> 00:30:55.135
That's the difference we're talking about.

590
00:30:55.355 --> 00:30:56.815
And why do we wanna do those things?

591
00:30:56.845 --> 00:31:00.495
Because we love him, because we love him,

592
00:31:00.495 --> 00:31:03.695
because we understand how much he's loved us first.

593
00:31:05.175 --> 00:31:07.105
Like you see this, why do we wanna do those things?

594
00:31:07.105 --> 00:31:10.065
Because we love him. And why do we love him?

595
00:31:10.065 --> 00:31:12.865
Because we understand how much he's loved us first.

596
00:31:12.975 --> 00:31:14.985
That he sent his only son to live,

597
00:31:15.085 --> 00:31:16.705
die resurrect in our place so

598
00:31:16.705 --> 00:31:18.505
that we can be reconciled to him forever.

599
00:31:18.965 --> 00:31:20.105
That's why we love him.

600
00:31:22.785 --> 00:31:26.245
One John four 19 we love because he first loved us.

601
00:31:29.055 --> 00:31:30.275
That's what pleases him.

602
00:31:30.345 --> 00:31:33.715
Like when we increasingly grow in our love for who he is

603
00:31:33.855 --> 00:31:35.995
and for what he's done, that's what pleases him.

604
00:31:36.045 --> 00:31:40.505
Where no matter the circumstances, even if

605
00:31:41.575 --> 00:31:43.065
that Philistine army, even if

606
00:31:43.065 --> 00:31:45.465
that massive army stands up against me,

607
00:31:45.465 --> 00:31:49.305
even if it's coming at me and I'm fearful and I'm worried

608
00:31:49.525 --> 00:31:52.225
and God seems delayed, he's not showing up.

609
00:31:52.225 --> 00:31:53.825
It seems like on my timeline,

610
00:31:54.165 --> 00:31:55.985
we still choose because we love him.

611
00:31:56.125 --> 00:31:58.145
We still choose to love him and obey him.

612
00:32:00.715 --> 00:32:02.685
Like even if that threat comes,

613
00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:07.835
even if God seems late, I trust him.

614
00:32:08.615 --> 00:32:12.675
I love him because here's what God's looking for,

615
00:32:12.695 --> 00:32:13.915
the final principle today.

616
00:32:14.935 --> 00:32:17.115
The Lord seeks a person after his own heart.

617
00:32:20.535 --> 00:32:24.425
That's what Jesus said to the woman with the well, worship

618
00:32:24.565 --> 00:32:27.585
and spirit and in truth, that's what Samuel said

619
00:32:27.585 --> 00:32:30.185
to Saul right here after Saul's failure, right?

620
00:32:31.775 --> 00:32:36.015
Verse 14, the Lord has sought out a man

621
00:32:36.015 --> 00:32:37.455
after his own heart.

622
00:32:38.155 --> 00:32:40.245
The Lord has commanded to be prince over his people.

623
00:32:40.445 --> 00:32:42.965
'cause you've not kept what the Lord commanded.

624
00:32:42.965 --> 00:32:44.485
You saw your heart wasn't in this.

625
00:32:46.415 --> 00:32:49.035
And so I'm looking for a man who has that kind of heart,

626
00:32:49.775 --> 00:32:50.835
who has a heart for me.

627
00:32:53.205 --> 00:32:56.145
And notice who it would be, a man after his own heart.

628
00:32:56.145 --> 00:32:59.585
Someone who understood how the kingship was supposed

629
00:32:59.745 --> 00:33:03.585
to work, that this was not a kingship like everybody else.

630
00:33:03.615 --> 00:33:08.145
This was a kingship under God, not on your own under God.

631
00:33:09.385 --> 00:33:13.515
Someone who knew the king had to remain fully submitted

632
00:33:13.515 --> 00:33:14.995
to the Lord or this thing wasn't gonna work.

633
00:33:18.845 --> 00:33:23.115
Here's the problem. Every king in

634
00:33:23.115 --> 00:33:24.155
Israel failed at that.

635
00:33:27.315 --> 00:33:31.285
Even the king that will come later to learn was labeled

636
00:33:32.045 --> 00:33:33.285
a man after his own heart.

637
00:33:35.495 --> 00:33:36.265
Even he failed.

638
00:33:40.925 --> 00:33:43.945
But again, like I said earlier, all of that is meant

639
00:33:43.945 --> 00:33:47.425
to point us to the source of our hope.

640
00:33:49.595 --> 00:33:53.375
Because eventually there was a king

641
00:33:54.795 --> 00:33:58.975
who not only sought the heart of God

642
00:34:00.115 --> 00:34:03.875
perfectly, he had the heart of God.

643
00:34:04.265 --> 00:34:06.685
Amen. And he was from Israel.

644
00:34:06.745 --> 00:34:09.645
He was from the tribe of Judah. He was from the line.

645
00:34:10.185 --> 00:34:11.965
He was a king

646
00:34:12.295 --> 00:34:15.845
after God's heart who had God's heart,

647
00:34:16.125 --> 00:34:18.965
a capital K King whose name is Jesus,

648
00:34:19.225 --> 00:34:22.325
who not only lived the perfect God seeking life that you

649
00:34:22.325 --> 00:34:24.845
and I can't live, he also died the death we

650
00:34:24.845 --> 00:34:26.125
deserve for failing at that.

651
00:34:26.305 --> 00:34:27.685
And then he defeated sin

652
00:34:27.685 --> 00:34:30.005
and death by coming outta that grave alive.

653
00:34:30.265 --> 00:34:32.085
That's the king that we should be looking for.

654
00:34:34.825 --> 00:34:36.565
And you know what God, God is seeking?

655
00:34:36.985 --> 00:34:39.885
Yes, true worshipers who do worship him in spirit

656
00:34:39.945 --> 00:34:42.805
and in truth, who seek his heart even when they sin.

657
00:34:42.945 --> 00:34:44.925
We see that with David in a few chapters.

658
00:34:45.025 --> 00:34:49.125
But like even when we sin, we still say, God, I love you.

659
00:34:49.325 --> 00:34:51.165
I want better. I don't want that anymore.

660
00:34:51.365 --> 00:34:52.365
I want to turn away from that.

661
00:34:52.425 --> 00:34:56.525
And I want you, he's seeking worshipers

662
00:34:56.525 --> 00:34:57.565
like you and me to do that.

663
00:34:57.865 --> 00:35:01.045
But our hope is not in how well we do at

664
00:35:01.045 --> 00:35:04.825
that 'cause.

665
00:35:04.825 --> 00:35:08.555
That is fickle. That'll change every day.

666
00:35:10.395 --> 00:35:11.935
Had a good day, feel close to God,

667
00:35:11.995 --> 00:35:13.575
had a bad day, feel far from God.

668
00:35:14.075 --> 00:35:15.855
That's not how this works.

669
00:35:18.495 --> 00:35:21.475
Our hope is in Christ alone.

670
00:35:23.695 --> 00:35:27.425
Because even as I imperfectly seek

671
00:35:28.075 --> 00:35:32.095
God's heart and I seek and I fail and I seek

672
00:35:32.095 --> 00:35:33.455
and I fail like Saul and David

673
00:35:33.475 --> 00:35:35.375
and everybody else, I seek and I fail.

674
00:35:35.715 --> 00:35:39.845
And even if I imperfectly do what he's seeking me to do,

675
00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:44.125
I know that I am covered by the perfect blood

676
00:35:44.145 --> 00:35:45.765
of Jesus, by faith.

677
00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:49.025
Amen. And that truth church,

678
00:35:50.825 --> 00:35:54.675
that truth is what makes me want to love him more.

679
00:35:55.765 --> 00:35:59.265
That's what makes me want to obey him more.

680
00:35:59.605 --> 00:36:02.545
That's what makes me want to seek him more.

681
00:36:02.545 --> 00:36:07.505
Because in spite of myself, he sought my heart first.

682
00:36:08.205 --> 00:36:10.245
Yes, that's good news.

683
00:36:12.555 --> 00:36:16.005
We have hope because of him.

684
00:36:18.935 --> 00:36:21.195
So I'll just invite you to bow with me for a second here

685
00:36:21.195 --> 00:36:24.725
because I, I know

686
00:36:25.495 --> 00:36:30.295
there was a lot I, I know there was a lot

687
00:36:30.295 --> 00:36:33.575
that God did in my heart this week

688
00:36:33.595 --> 00:36:36.295
and what he's doing in yours right now.

689
00:36:39.735 --> 00:36:41.355
So just in that spirit of prayer,

690
00:36:45.305 --> 00:36:50.145
maybe he's convicting where you have

691
00:36:51.605 --> 00:36:53.955
taken Satan's bait over and over and over

692
00:36:54.255 --> 00:36:58.155
and you've seen those things as better somehow at that lure,

693
00:36:58.815 --> 00:37:02.935
the fool's gold will sometimes this time satisfy you.

694
00:37:07.385 --> 00:37:10.705
But you know it won't. You know, it won't.

695
00:37:12.855 --> 00:37:17.215
So just confess, confess to the Lord

696
00:37:17.215 --> 00:37:19.855
that right now, whatever it is,

697
00:37:25.015 --> 00:37:29.615
just spend some time resting in the grace

698
00:37:30.395 --> 00:37:31.455
and mercy of God.

699
00:37:45.645 --> 00:37:47.505
And one of the principles in scripture is

700
00:37:47.505 --> 00:37:48.825
that he gives us a new heart.

701
00:37:49.745 --> 00:37:51.955
When you're born again by faith, when he

702
00:37:52.795 --> 00:37:54.145
makes you a new creation,

703
00:37:54.855 --> 00:37:57.865
he's making you into a new creation.

704
00:37:58.485 --> 00:38:00.905
And yet his promise that he gives you a new heart.

705
00:38:00.965 --> 00:38:05.145
So knowing my own, just ask the Lord

706
00:38:05.245 --> 00:38:09.305
to continue to rip out the old heart of stone

707
00:38:09.365 --> 00:38:12.625
and give you that heart of flesh that pursues him,

708
00:38:12.655 --> 00:38:14.385
that wants him, that longs for him.

709
00:38:18.115 --> 00:38:20.565
I know some you've walked

710
00:38:20.635 --> 00:38:24.605
that stone heart life for so long.

711
00:38:29.965 --> 00:38:31.185
So God's got a big hammer.

712
00:38:31.405 --> 00:38:35.210
He can, he can break that as hard

713
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.835
as it might be in your heart right now.

714
00:38:36.935 --> 00:38:38.675
He can break that and wants to,

715
00:38:42.245 --> 00:38:45.625
you have to just turn to him in faith, in simple faith.

716
00:38:46.915 --> 00:38:50.175
Thank God I for

717
00:38:50.175 --> 00:38:55.135
so long have not wanted you, longed for you, desired you.

718
00:38:55.315 --> 00:38:56.735
So God changed my heart.

719
00:38:58.225 --> 00:39:01.875
Lead me out of sin into a holy life.

720
00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:04.765
Change my heart though,

721
00:39:07.315 --> 00:39:08.655
and watch what he does with that.

722
00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:11.535
Just a fully submitted like the king should have

723
00:39:11.535 --> 00:39:12.575
been fully submitted.

724
00:39:12.595 --> 00:39:13.455
God, I'm yours

725
00:39:17.035 --> 00:39:17.775
and I trust you.

726
00:39:18.865 --> 00:39:23.055
Thank you for saving. Thank you for replacing me.

727
00:39:23.365 --> 00:39:26.285
Life, death, and resurrection. And we give you glory.

728
00:39:28.535 --> 00:39:31.605
And God help me. Help us

729
00:39:33.715 --> 00:39:38.375
to live lives that honor you for your glory.

730
00:39:39.195 --> 00:39:42.495
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

731
00:39:45.475 --> 00:39:46.975
And so, Lord church, if, if the.
