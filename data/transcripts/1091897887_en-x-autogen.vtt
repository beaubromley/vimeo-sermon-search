00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.385
Good morning church.

2
00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:39.545
Good morning, church. There you go.

3
00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:43.305
Uh, my name's TR Lewis, uh, one of the elders here.

4
00:00:43.305 --> 00:00:44.425
It's a pleasure to be with you.

5
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.545
Um, I'm not sure if you've ever tried to carry a table

6
00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:49.105
with a plum bob on it.

7
00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:51.465
Um, but it's not easy. And

8
00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:53.465
so I got better from first service to this service.

9
00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.025
I grew a little bit, um,

10
00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:56.665
but it's a treat to get to be here with you guys

11
00:00:56.725 --> 00:00:57.865
and open God's word.

12
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.385
Um, this morning, this morning,

13
00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:04.865
we're gonna pick back up in Romans chapter 12, verse 11.

14
00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:09.065
We've been studying through this section

15
00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:10.865
of Romans over the last few weeks.

16
00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:14.025
And you know that this is a, the center section

17
00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:17.785
of Paul's longest letter that he wrote in the New Testament.

18
00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:22.665
Um, it's a letter where he begins with 11 chapters

19
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.305
of telling us about the why of following Christ,

20
00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:28.185
about the theology of following Christ.

21
00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:31.625
And then he moves into chapter 12 with the how.

22
00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:35.425
And so we've been looking at that over these last few weeks.

23
00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:39.265
We've been using it, um, as we realign our lives

24
00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:40.505
and following after Christ.

25
00:01:40.645 --> 00:01:45.185
And, and we've used this example of this PBO

26
00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:48.905
that hangs and points us to Christ.

27
00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:53.585
It sinners us and certainly if we believe that

28
00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:56.425
as we've repented of our sins

29
00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:58.065
and turn from our old way of life,

30
00:01:59.055 --> 00:02:01.545
that this new life in Christ should look very

31
00:02:01.545 --> 00:02:03.185
different as we move forward.

32
00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:08.465
So in Romans chapter 12, Paul begins to unpack for us

33
00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:11.185
with instruction what that life looks like.

34
00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:13.425
Jesus lived it out perfectly,

35
00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:16.985
but then Paul gives us words that we're to, to live by.

36
00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:20.865
And so as we use this plum Bob,

37
00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:23.665
many times our flesh bumps up against it

38
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:26.345
and tries to push it to the right or to the left.

39
00:02:26.365 --> 00:02:27.465
We sway back and forth.

40
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:30.785
And one of my friends, one of my good friends,

41
00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:33.385
uses the phrase, the cautionary phrase,

42
00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:36.065
there's a ditch on both sides of the road

43
00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:38.545
that if you veer too far to the left

44
00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:41.465
or too far to the right, you might find yourself in a ditch.

45
00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:44.225
And I didn't. I understood that,

46
00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:45.905
but I hadn't experienced it till recently.

47
00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:49.865
And about six weeks ago, um, I got that experience.

48
00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:52.745
Um, I found myself in a ditch.

49
00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:55.425
I was on my way back from Stillwater.

50
00:02:56.365 --> 00:02:58.705
Um, I had just gotten my car outta the shop.

51
00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:02.645
I have an old car for UU students. It was from the 1990s.

52
00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:04.605
It's a nineties Toyota, so it's old,

53
00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:07.045
but I, I just got outta the shop Now.

54
00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:09.005
This car has been reborn a few times.

55
00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:12.485
And and this was a tuneup. This was a realignment.

56
00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:13.725
I was getting some things fixed

57
00:03:14.025 --> 00:03:16.005
and it was fresh from the Toyota dealership.

58
00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:17.845
And so I'm driving back from Stillwater.

59
00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.405
And actually that day I was, uh, supposed to be preparing

60
00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:23.365
for a sermon, but I decided

61
00:03:23.365 --> 00:03:25.605
before I would go to the coffee shop or library

62
00:03:25.825 --> 00:03:28.165
or home to work, I might take a detour.

63
00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:31.765
So I took a detour from what I was supposed to be doing.

64
00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:35.285
I turned off on Indian Meridian off of Highway 51.

65
00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:37.525
Now, if you know anything about Indian Meridian,

66
00:03:37.995 --> 00:03:39.285
it's not all paved.

67
00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:42.485
And so as I came through coil,

68
00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:44.965
I was heading south with zeal.

69
00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:49.805
I was probably listening to a sermon or podcast or,

70
00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:50.965
or, or something really good.

71
00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:54.885
I was thinking about though my detour,

72
00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:57.765
I was thinking about I was gonna go by and check some ponds

73
00:03:57.765 --> 00:04:00.245
and see how much water was in 'em because it was raining.

74
00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:03.085
And in that moment when the asphalt gave way

75
00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:05.085
and it turned to red clay, I got sideways.

76
00:04:05.685 --> 00:04:06.845
I didn't make it 50 yards.

77
00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:09.325
And then I was 90 degrees in the ditch, as you saw.

78
00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:13.525
So I was standing there in the ditch.

79
00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:14.965
Well, I was standing in my car.

80
00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:17.965
I had to stand on my passenger side door, um,

81
00:04:17.965 --> 00:04:21.125
because it was on its side and I couldn't get out.

82
00:04:21.285 --> 00:04:23.845
I was stuck. And I realized in that moment

83
00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:25.485
what it meant to be stuck in a ditch.

84
00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:27.965
So I texted that picture to my friend, so now I get it,

85
00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:30.405
but I couldn't rescue myself.

86
00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:32.045
I couldn't get, I had to call for help.

87
00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.045
So the coil volunteer firefighters came.

88
00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:36.765
The Oklahoma Highway Patrol came

89
00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:39.885
and ultimately Darrel's wrecker service came.

90
00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:44.405
Darrel's wrecker service came and he looked at that

91
00:04:44.405 --> 00:04:49.285
and he said, that's bad, but I'll tell you,

92
00:04:49.285 --> 00:04:51.965
he flipped me straight and he pulled me out of the ditch

93
00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:53.245
and put me back up on the road.

94
00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:55.525
And Darryl helped me check the oil

95
00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:56.645
and there was oil in the engine.

96
00:04:57.465 --> 00:05:00.845
So that started up. So we started it up and I drove it home,

97
00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:02.725
and I'm still driving it today.

98
00:05:02.725 --> 00:05:03.725
I drove to church. It's in the parking

99
00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:04.525
lot if you wanna take a look.

100
00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:09.485
But as I was driving home, I noticed something

101
00:05:10.155 --> 00:05:12.045
that it was pulling a little bit to the right.

102
00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:14.805
So you see that that alignment work

103
00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:17.325
that I just had done was knocked back out of alignment.

104
00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.085
So the only repair that I needed to do

105
00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:23.845
after flipping 90 degrees into a ditch with the help

106
00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:26.845
of Darrell, I was righted, checked to make sure I was safe,

107
00:05:27.945 --> 00:05:30.485
but I had to get my alignment redone in my car.

108
00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:34.925
And my prayer this morning is that Romans chapter 12,

109
00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:38.165
verse 11 will serve in some ways as a realignment for us,

110
00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:40.245
because there's three phrases.

111
00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:43.485
And those three phrases, the first two, we can veer off

112
00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:44.605
to one way or the other.

113
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.445
But the third one will write us in the

114
00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:49.005
center and keep us straight.

115
00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:54.245
So as we come to verse 11 today, we'll read it.

116
00:05:54.705 --> 00:05:58.125
It says, do not be thoughtful and zeal.

117
00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:02.285
Be fervent in the Spirit, serve the Lord.

118
00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:07.005
And years ago, the Lewis family adopted this section

119
00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:08.325
of Romans, Romans nine

120
00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:12.125
or 12, nine through 13 as a verse for our family.

121
00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:14.565
And so I'm not much of an artist, um,

122
00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:17.885
but I tried to encapsulate this in an acrostic poem.

123
00:06:18.225 --> 00:06:20.245
If you know what that is, you take the letters of a word

124
00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:21.685
and then you put words out next to it.

125
00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:25.845
So I jotted out these words for our family.

126
00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:31.365
It says, love, encourage, and witness and service.

127
00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:35.045
Now I know that five words can

128
00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:36.645
encapsulate all of these verses.

129
00:06:37.425 --> 00:06:41.405
And over the last few weeks we've been studying that we are

130
00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:42.445
to love one another.

131
00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:44.285
We're to love with brotherly affection.

132
00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:48.325
We're to outdo one another in showing zeal.

133
00:06:50.015 --> 00:06:52.765
We're to love and to hold fast to what is good,

134
00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:55.885
and we are too abhor and run away from what is evil.

135
00:06:57.385 --> 00:06:58.805
And today, Paul goes on

136
00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:01.605
and he calls us to three things, to be thoughtful,

137
00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:03.485
to not be thoughtful in zeal,

138
00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:06.205
to be fervent in the spirit and to serve the Lord.

139
00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:09.605
So let's start with the first one, zeal.

140
00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:14.005
So zeal is passionate enthusiasm.

141
00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:16.845
That passionate enthusiasm often

142
00:07:17.585 --> 00:07:20.165
spills over into one's actions.

143
00:07:20.445 --> 00:07:21.645
Zeal is a drive for your life.

144
00:07:21.665 --> 00:07:23.845
It affects everything that you do.

145
00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:28.685
But it's still, it's still kind of just a concept.

146
00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:31.285
And these are all kind of concepts today.

147
00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.965
And as I move through, I wanna paint a picture for us today.

148
00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:36.805
So in your notes, you have room to jot and write.

149
00:07:36.945 --> 00:07:38.325
You can draw a picture if you want to.

150
00:07:38.905 --> 00:07:41.245
But I'm gonna paint a picture with people of

151
00:07:41.245 --> 00:07:42.965
what these three things look like.

152
00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:46.045
The first is zeal. Now, last time I preached up here,

153
00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:49.685
I talked about, we were studying Psalm 66, a shout

154
00:07:49.705 --> 00:07:52.085
to the Lord, and we talked about the Aggie.

155
00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:55.325
Whoop, nobody remembers it clearly.

156
00:07:56.105 --> 00:07:58.005
Um, but the first service nine,

157
00:07:58.115 --> 00:07:59.485
nine o'clock did, I'm just saying.

158
00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:02.605
But um, so we talked about the Aggie whoop.

159
00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:05.845
Well, on that campus there are five guys called the fight in

160
00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:09.645
Texas, Aggie, Yale leaders that are a picture of zeal.

161
00:08:11.865 --> 00:08:13.045
Now time doesn't permit

162
00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:14.485
nor to be glorifying to God

163
00:08:14.485 --> 00:08:16.085
to talk too much about the Yale leaders,

164
00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:20.485
but they are a picture of zeal.

165
00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:23.845
They wear funny clothes, but they do it with a purpose.

166
00:08:24.735 --> 00:08:27.085
These guys run around campus and they yell

167
00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:30.725
and they jump, they tell stories with gusto.

168
00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:34.685
They lead the crowd in cheering on the team,

169
00:08:35.705 --> 00:08:38.125
and they stir in others of love for Texas a and m.

170
00:08:39.455 --> 00:08:42.125
These guys, they, they're there for a purpose

171
00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:44.005
and that zeal drives them.

172
00:08:45.105 --> 00:08:46.565
But Paul doesn't call us just

173
00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:48.125
to like run around and do stuff.

174
00:08:49.105 --> 00:08:50.925
He calls us to do it with a purpose.

175
00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:57.335
Now, there's some people, the ditch on the side of

176
00:08:57.335 --> 00:08:59.375
that is sloth or slothfulness.

177
00:08:59.635 --> 00:09:01.295
And so Paul guards us against that.

178
00:09:01.295 --> 00:09:04.135
He says, don't just be slothful.

179
00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:05.655
Now, that's not a word that we throw

180
00:09:05.655 --> 00:09:08.335
around a lot in Edmond in 2025,

181
00:09:09.275 --> 00:09:13.135
but the word in Spanish for sloth the animal, right?

182
00:09:13.145 --> 00:09:15.535
Maybe some of you have seen a sloth in the wild.

183
00:09:16.075 --> 00:09:19.935
The same word is used for sloth perso as it is for

184
00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:23.255
being lazy perso.

185
00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:27.335
Now, if you've seen a sloth in the wild, they're very slow.

186
00:09:28.195 --> 00:09:30.655
And maybe more of you have seen the movie Zootopia

187
00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:34.455
and the sloth in Zootopia that works at the DMV,

188
00:09:36.595 --> 00:09:39.655
who speaks very slowly

189
00:09:40.515 --> 00:09:42.255
and moves very slowly.

190
00:09:43.085 --> 00:09:46.415
It's painful. It's painful for me to watch that scene

191
00:09:46.605 --> 00:09:49.935
because that that sloth is not getting anything done.

192
00:09:50.515 --> 00:09:53.175
And I think that's what Paul is guarding against us,

193
00:09:53.535 --> 00:09:54.575
guarding us against.

194
00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:57.335
You see, he wants us to serve with an energy

195
00:09:57.715 --> 00:10:01.495
and an enthusiasm and an efficacy following after Christ.

196
00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.375
And a picture of that in our church

197
00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:06.615
that I think about are guys like Scotty Louderback

198
00:10:06.715 --> 00:10:07.895
and Jeff Berkholder.

199
00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:10.335
Guys like Bill Netherland

200
00:10:10.795 --> 00:10:13.215
and David Matheson who's serving hillside kids.

201
00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:16.095
There's so many more today wearing their t-shirts

202
00:10:16.095 --> 00:10:18.175
that are gonna be serving with zeal this week.

203
00:10:19.075 --> 00:10:22.055
And so zeal, these guys, paint a picture for me of zeal.

204
00:10:22.765 --> 00:10:25.415
They often wear funny clothes, but with a purpose.

205
00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:30.175
They often jump and sing and, and act out stories,

206
00:10:30.955 --> 00:10:33.215
but it's for the purpose of pointing kids

207
00:10:33.795 --> 00:10:35.415
and even adults to the Lord.

208
00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:38.455
And these men are all deacons in our church.

209
00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:42.095
They get stuff done, they serve behind the scenes.

210
00:10:42.095 --> 00:10:45.055
And deacon benevolence, they care for widows.

211
00:10:45.965 --> 00:10:48.175
They do so many things around our church.

212
00:10:48.955 --> 00:10:53.215
In zeal, God's word also gives us

213
00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:54.335
an example of zeal.

214
00:10:55.115 --> 00:10:56.695
We see that in the Apostle Peter,

215
00:10:58.415 --> 00:11:01.035
and we know that we, that Peter's zeal wasn't always

216
00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:02.115
perfectly lived out,

217
00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:06.035
but we see zeal in Peter in the way that he left everything.

218
00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:08.115
He left everything to follow Christ.

219
00:11:08.775 --> 00:11:09.915
He was in that boat fishing

220
00:11:09.975 --> 00:11:13.355
and he walked away from that to follow a zeal after Christ.

221
00:11:13.455 --> 00:11:16.995
We see the zeal of Peter as he challenged Christ

222
00:11:17.575 --> 00:11:18.635
and he was rebuked.

223
00:11:19.335 --> 00:11:22.555
We see the zeal of Peter as he drew his sword

224
00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:26.195
to cut off the ear of the guard that came to arrest Jesus.

225
00:11:27.735 --> 00:11:30.395
But we see that zeal of Peter refined

226
00:11:30.975 --> 00:11:35.435
and redeemed as Jesus restores Peter by

227
00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:37.515
that seashore as he's cooking the fish

228
00:11:37.515 --> 00:11:38.635
over the charcoal fire.

229
00:11:38.655 --> 00:11:40.475
And he says, Peter, will you feed my sheep?

230
00:11:41.295 --> 00:11:43.595
And that zeal of Peters refined

231
00:11:43.595 --> 00:11:48.435
and reshaped in service to the Lord, he was called the rock

232
00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:51.355
that Christ would use to build his church in the world.

233
00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:55.405
And later in Peter's first epistle,

234
00:11:55.405 --> 00:11:58.205
we have some words about Zeal Peter's own words

235
00:11:58.205 --> 00:12:00.685
that he wrote to those early dispersed Christians,

236
00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:02.685
but are good for us today.

237
00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:06.205
So let's look in first Peter chapter three,

238
00:12:07.425 --> 00:12:08.565
verses eight through 13.

239
00:12:09.905 --> 00:12:13.685
He says, finally, all of you have unity of mind,

240
00:12:14.805 --> 00:12:16.205
sympathy, brotherly love,

241
00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:18.405
and a tender heart and a humble mind.

242
00:12:19.145 --> 00:12:22.525
Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling.

243
00:12:22.525 --> 00:12:26.565
But on the contrary, bless for to this you were called

244
00:12:27.035 --> 00:12:31.125
that you may obtain a blessing for whoever desires

245
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.645
to love life and see good days.

246
00:12:32.745 --> 00:12:35.525
Let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceit.

247
00:12:36.225 --> 00:12:38.645
Let him turn away from evil and do good.

248
00:12:39.985 --> 00:12:41.965
Let him seek peace and pursue it.

249
00:12:42.705 --> 00:12:44.565
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous

250
00:12:44.825 --> 00:12:46.765
and his ears are open to their prayer.

251
00:12:47.745 --> 00:12:50.925
But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.

252
00:12:52.065 --> 00:12:55.525
Now, who is there to harm you if you are zealous

253
00:12:55.785 --> 00:12:57.045
for doing what is good.

254
00:12:58.705 --> 00:13:01.725
You see, Peter writes to these, these early believers

255
00:13:01.725 --> 00:13:03.205
and reminds them these words

256
00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:06.445
that middle sections actually from Psalm chapter 34,

257
00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:09.645
where David is glorifying God.

258
00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:11.485
He's reminding himself

259
00:13:11.945 --> 00:13:13.805
and he's also reminding the singers

260
00:13:14.955 --> 00:13:17.245
that it's God who lifts us up.

261
00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:20.685
It's God who pulls us out of the ditch.

262
00:13:21.115 --> 00:13:25.085
It's God who puts us back on the path with zeal.

263
00:13:26.145 --> 00:13:29.725
Now, some of you may feel like you're already in that ditch,

264
00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.605
some may feel like you're sliding towards it

265
00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:34.885
and some may feel like you've been put back up,

266
00:13:35.265 --> 00:13:37.285
but you're still needing to be realigned.

267
00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:41.005
But let us remember these words that if we're zealous

268
00:13:41.025 --> 00:13:44.005
for doing good, if that's our purpose, if we're following

269
00:13:44.005 --> 00:13:47.245
after Christ, the way Peter calls us, that there's no one,

270
00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:50.285
no one who's against us or who can be against us.

271
00:13:51.465 --> 00:13:54.125
But most perfectly we see the zeal

272
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.845
of the Lord played out in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

273
00:13:57.665 --> 00:14:00.365
In fact, we read in the prophecy of Jesus

274
00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:02.925
and Isaiah chapter nine about the zeal of the Lord

275
00:14:03.945 --> 00:14:05.565
and Isaiah nine, six,

276
00:14:05.565 --> 00:14:09.885
and seven, he writes, for to us, a child is born unto us.

277
00:14:10.085 --> 00:14:12.565
A son is given and the government shall

278
00:14:12.565 --> 00:14:13.685
be upon his shoulders.

279
00:14:13.745 --> 00:14:17.325
His name shall be called wonderful Counselor

280
00:14:18.365 --> 00:14:21.125
Almighty God, the everlasting Father

281
00:14:22.305 --> 00:14:25.765
and prince of peace, of the increase

282
00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:27.205
of his government and of peace.

283
00:14:27.205 --> 00:14:29.805
There will be no end on the throne of David

284
00:14:29.865 --> 00:14:31.885
and over his kingdom to establish it

285
00:14:32.105 --> 00:14:34.605
and to uphold it with righteousness

286
00:14:34.745 --> 00:14:38.205
and justice from this time forth and forevermore.

287
00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:43.205
Now, this is a lofty prophecy.

288
00:14:45.005 --> 00:14:48.255
It's a lofty thing that God is laying out

289
00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:50.775
through his prophet Isaiah to the people.

290
00:14:51.345 --> 00:14:54.885
And then he says this, he says, the zeal of the Lord

291
00:14:55.065 --> 00:14:56.805
of hosts will do this.

292
00:14:57.785 --> 00:14:59.885
You see Jesus coming to this earth, coming

293
00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:03.045
as the fulfillment of that prophecy's testimony of the zeal

294
00:15:03.225 --> 00:15:04.685
of the Lord of hosts.

295
00:15:05.995 --> 00:15:07.165
It's a visible sign.

296
00:15:07.785 --> 00:15:11.005
And then we see that zeal of the Lord played out in the life

297
00:15:11.265 --> 00:15:14.605
of Christ as he lived and walked with a passion

298
00:15:14.865 --> 00:15:18.445
and conviction, not shrinking away from the oppression

299
00:15:18.445 --> 00:15:19.725
or persecution that he faced,

300
00:15:20.105 --> 00:15:22.285
but rather being that wonderful counselor

301
00:15:23.185 --> 00:15:25.125
living in the flesh as mighty God

302
00:15:26.465 --> 00:15:28.965
and establishing forever as a prince of peace.

303
00:15:30.545 --> 00:15:33.245
You see, Jesus lived with a passion for God

304
00:15:33.705 --> 00:15:35.485
and he lived with a passion for others.

305
00:15:35.825 --> 00:15:37.045
He was excited about it.

306
00:15:38.065 --> 00:15:41.645
We don't read about him running around or or jumping or

307
00:15:41.645 --> 00:15:43.045
or all these exuberant things.

308
00:15:45.305 --> 00:15:46.805
But he lived his life filled

309
00:15:46.865 --> 00:15:51.205
and driven by a passion, a zeal for God's glory, a zeal

310
00:15:51.225 --> 00:15:54.525
for the redemption of the lost, for the restoration

311
00:15:54.865 --> 00:15:57.285
of the broken for salvation

312
00:15:57.305 --> 00:16:00.005
and healing of the sick and the hurting.

313
00:16:01.265 --> 00:16:03.245
The zeal of the Lord was in him.

314
00:16:03.705 --> 00:16:06.085
The passion and energy was lived out,

315
00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:08.965
and it was never ineffectively slow

316
00:16:10.065 --> 00:16:12.485
and it was never hurried in any way.

317
00:16:13.985 --> 00:16:15.125
Jesus' pace of life

318
00:16:15.185 --> 00:16:17.845
and pace of ministry was fueled

319
00:16:17.845 --> 00:16:19.565
by the spirit in perfect zeal.

320
00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:25.885
And in fact, today the the zeal for the things

321
00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:28.365
of the world can try to draw us away.

322
00:16:28.505 --> 00:16:30.765
It can push us to the left or to the right.

323
00:16:31.505 --> 00:16:33.725
But if you look to Christ's example of being fueled

324
00:16:33.725 --> 00:16:36.085
with the zeal of the Lord, it writes us.

325
00:16:37.825 --> 00:16:39.325
And so Paul gives us another phrase,

326
00:16:39.325 --> 00:16:41.245
another instruction or a command.

327
00:16:41.745 --> 00:16:44.085
He tells us to be fervent in spirit.

328
00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:46.445
And you, you see each of these phrases

329
00:16:46.445 --> 00:16:47.605
kind of builds one on the other.

330
00:16:47.705 --> 00:16:50.245
So we're called to not be thoughtful in zeal,

331
00:16:50.665 --> 00:16:53.285
but the next, he calls us to be fervent in spirit.

332
00:16:54.025 --> 00:16:55.965
And this word fervent is again, one

333
00:16:55.965 --> 00:16:58.005
that we don't use every day in Edmond,

334
00:16:58.185 --> 00:16:59.325
uh, in today's language.

335
00:16:59.345 --> 00:17:02.325
But it, it has its roots in the word for boiling

336
00:17:02.325 --> 00:17:05.725
or the idea of boiling that as you apply energy

337
00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:08.525
or heat to a pot of water, it starts to stir

338
00:17:08.665 --> 00:17:09.685
and move and bubble.

339
00:17:10.065 --> 00:17:11.925
And eventually that turns into a boil.

340
00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:15.645
And as you as that flame stays, that boil turns into a roll.

341
00:17:16.545 --> 00:17:18.605
And then is in that place that that pot of water

342
00:17:19.115 --> 00:17:23.045
that was sitting lukewarm, it becomes effective for work.

343
00:17:23.665 --> 00:17:26.765
It produces heat, it can cook pasta,

344
00:17:27.145 --> 00:17:28.645
it can make tea, it can make coffee.

345
00:17:28.995 --> 00:17:31.765
That pot of water can do so many things as

346
00:17:31.765 --> 00:17:33.285
that heat is applied to it.

347
00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:37.605
There's an additional kind of facet of the word fervor

348
00:17:37.705 --> 00:17:40.365
or fervent that I think about kind of a groundedness

349
00:17:40.905 --> 00:17:43.245
or a connectedness when I think of fervor.

350
00:17:44.185 --> 00:17:47.085
And I think that has to do with, with a proximity to

351
00:17:47.085 --> 00:17:48.165
that source of energy

352
00:17:48.185 --> 00:17:51.160
or keeping that pot close to the flame, close to the heat.

353
00:17:51.715 --> 00:17:52.805
When I was at Texas a

354
00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.565
and m, I had a fervor

355
00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:56.405
for the Aggie spirit 'cause I was on campus.

356
00:17:56.725 --> 00:17:59.445
I was close to the action, I went to all the football games.

357
00:18:00.185 --> 00:18:03.885
But as I've moved far away, that fervor has died down.

358
00:18:04.755 --> 00:18:06.085
Many people would say that's a good thing

359
00:18:06.345 --> 00:18:08.565
and we got some amens in the first service.

360
00:18:08.785 --> 00:18:13.685
But Paul calls us to be fervent in spirit

361
00:18:14.145 --> 00:18:16.965
and some versions even say fervent in the spirit,

362
00:18:17.635 --> 00:18:21.405
that we allow the Holy Spirit to be the one that fuels us

363
00:18:22.515 --> 00:18:23.655
and energizes us.

364
00:18:24.715 --> 00:18:28.415
Now there are many in our church that display fervency

365
00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:32.695
of spirit, but I think none more so than Ryan Whitaker.

366
00:18:33.555 --> 00:18:35.575
You see, Ryan is a, is an elder brother.

367
00:18:35.595 --> 00:18:37.135
And through this process, I've gotten

368
00:18:37.135 --> 00:18:38.335
to know him more and more.

369
00:18:39.715 --> 00:18:41.415
And the closer I've gotten with him,

370
00:18:41.415 --> 00:18:43.175
the more time I've spent, the more I see his

371
00:18:43.375 --> 00:18:45.335
fervency of spirit.

372
00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:51.255
Ryan stays in proximity to the flame through prayer

373
00:18:51.315 --> 00:18:54.695
and through bible study, through scripture memorization

374
00:18:54.795 --> 00:18:57.975
and through meditation, he allows the Holy Spirit

375
00:18:57.995 --> 00:18:59.095
to fuel his spirit

376
00:19:00.355 --> 00:19:03.175
and this rolling boil of spirit that Ryan has

377
00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:04.335
that spills out to others.

378
00:19:05.035 --> 00:19:07.255
He uses that energy, that boiling

379
00:19:07.255 --> 00:19:08.695
to bless through mentoring.

380
00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:10.815
He mentors men, young and old.

381
00:19:11.395 --> 00:19:15.055
He leads a community group of young couples with his wife.

382
00:19:16.965 --> 00:19:20.065
He serves in so many ways, he comforts with the comfort

383
00:19:20.065 --> 00:19:21.825
that he has been given in Christ.

384
00:19:21.845 --> 00:19:24.265
And he's fueled by the spirit in all these ways.

385
00:19:25.005 --> 00:19:27.305
If you don't know Ryan, get to meet him.

386
00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:29.465
Listen closely to him

387
00:19:30.325 --> 00:19:31.785
and get a sense of what it looks like

388
00:19:31.885 --> 00:19:35.225
to be maintained in the spirit at a rolling boil.

389
00:19:37.085 --> 00:19:41.785
In scripture, Paul uses the phrase,

390
00:19:41.965 --> 00:19:45.585
the same phrase, fervent in spirit to describe

391
00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:49.385
his partner in ministry and fellow preacher Apollos.

392
00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:53.945
In Acts chapter 18, he introduces us to Apollos.

393
00:19:55.285 --> 00:19:56.665
He, he introduces him this way.

394
00:19:57.725 --> 00:20:01.825
He says, now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria,

395
00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:02.825
came to Ephesus.

396
00:20:03.565 --> 00:20:06.745
He was eloquent in spirit. I'm sorry.

397
00:20:06.745 --> 00:20:09.185
He was an eloquent man, competent in the scriptures

398
00:20:09.525 --> 00:20:12.345
and had it been instructed in the way of the Lord

399
00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:15.945
and being fervent in spirit, he spoke

400
00:20:15.945 --> 00:20:18.145
and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus.

401
00:20:18.405 --> 00:20:22.145
Though he knew only the baptism of John, he began

402
00:20:22.145 --> 00:20:23.705
to speak boldly in the synagogues.

403
00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:27.625
But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside

404
00:20:27.645 --> 00:20:30.585
and explained to him the way of the God more accurately.

405
00:20:31.245 --> 00:20:32.865
And when he wished to cross to Acha,

406
00:20:33.205 --> 00:20:34.545
the brothers encouraged him

407
00:20:34.545 --> 00:20:36.745
and wrote to the disciples to welcome him.

408
00:20:37.485 --> 00:20:39.985
And when he arrived, he greatly helped those who

409
00:20:39.985 --> 00:20:41.145
through grace and believed

410
00:20:41.685 --> 00:20:44.225
for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing

411
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:48.165
by the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.

412
00:20:50.325 --> 00:20:53.385
So we see Apollo described by Paul being fervent in spirit,

413
00:20:53.445 --> 00:20:55.265
the very phrase that he uses

414
00:20:56.245 --> 00:20:58.425
to refine us in Romans chapter 12.

415
00:20:59.165 --> 00:21:00.305
So we, we should look at what

416
00:21:00.305 --> 00:21:02.145
that looked like in the life of Apollo.

417
00:21:02.645 --> 00:21:06.745
We see that Apollo's spirit was boiling, he was fueled,

418
00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:09.345
he was heated up by knowledge of God,

419
00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:14.665
a competency in the scriptures and a willingness to learn.

420
00:21:16.125 --> 00:21:17.465
He was fervent in spirit.

421
00:21:17.525 --> 00:21:21.025
And that fervent ness of spirit, that fervor spilled out.

422
00:21:22.965 --> 00:21:26.865
It spilled out on those around him and his teaching.

423
00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:29.225
He was teaching in the synagogue of all places.

424
00:21:29.925 --> 00:21:32.305
And Paul tells us that he had an eloquence of speech

425
00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:34.265
and he accurately taught the things of God.

426
00:21:35.165 --> 00:21:37.625
And yet Apollo still needed instruction

427
00:21:37.845 --> 00:21:39.545
and still needed refining.

428
00:21:40.205 --> 00:21:44.385
And one Corinthians, we see that fervor of Apollos,

429
00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:47.945
that powerful teaching had the effect

430
00:21:47.965 --> 00:21:51.385
of followers in the congregation professing a following

431
00:21:51.385 --> 00:21:53.425
or allegiance to Apollos over

432
00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:57.465
and above the other teachers, over and above Paul, and, and

433
00:21:57.465 --> 00:21:58.905
and an allegiance to Apollos.

434
00:21:59.295 --> 00:22:01.945
Because you see that fervor, that fervency

435
00:22:01.945 --> 00:22:06.265
of spirit is powerful and it can be misdirected

436
00:22:06.265 --> 00:22:07.865
or misused for self-service.

437
00:22:10.285 --> 00:22:11.905
And so we're to guard against that.

438
00:22:12.765 --> 00:22:14.265
We read later in one Corinthians

439
00:22:14.265 --> 00:22:15.865
that Paul does correct those believers.

440
00:22:15.865 --> 00:22:19.705
He tells them that, that it's not Paul, it's not Apollos,

441
00:22:19.935 --> 00:22:21.225
it's not any other teacher.

442
00:22:21.895 --> 00:22:23.345
It's God who gives the growth.

443
00:22:23.455 --> 00:22:26.305
It's the spirit that brings about that, that life

444
00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.465
in the body of Christ.

445
00:22:30.485 --> 00:22:34.025
And so we see that, that that fervor working in

446
00:22:34.025 --> 00:22:37.025
and through Apollos can be used to glorify God,

447
00:22:37.935 --> 00:22:41.825
that can also be misapplied and distracted.

448
00:22:43.165 --> 00:22:44.425
But we see the fervor

449
00:22:44.525 --> 00:22:48.345
of spirit never more present than in the life of our savior.

450
00:22:50.255 --> 00:22:52.825
This is how Jesus reveals to us the fervency of Spirit.

451
00:22:53.325 --> 00:22:55.185
He came on this earth in the flesh,

452
00:22:55.885 --> 00:22:59.305
and yet he was also fully God through his life.

453
00:22:59.325 --> 00:23:00.945
He maintained perfect communion

454
00:23:00.945 --> 00:23:02.705
with the Father and the Spirit.

455
00:23:03.845 --> 00:23:05.185
He was fueled by the spirit.

456
00:23:05.245 --> 00:23:07.945
We see him led by the Spirit as he goes into the wilderness

457
00:23:09.405 --> 00:23:11.625
and he rebuked the twisted attacks of Satan

458
00:23:11.775 --> 00:23:13.305
through the truth of scripture.

459
00:23:14.925 --> 00:23:18.865
We see Christ's fervent spirit in that he was fully aware

460
00:23:19.805 --> 00:23:24.065
of the needs and compassionate towards those around him.

461
00:23:24.965 --> 00:23:28.065
He was sensitive in the spirit to the things

462
00:23:28.065 --> 00:23:30.745
that he encountered that would rob God of his glory

463
00:23:31.605 --> 00:23:33.705
or distort the image of the Father.

464
00:23:34.845 --> 00:23:37.465
You see, Jesus did boil.

465
00:23:37.485 --> 00:23:39.465
He had that rolling boil inside

466
00:23:39.485 --> 00:23:42.825
and he bubbled over in that fervor in perfect ways.

467
00:23:43.845 --> 00:23:47.875
He never drifted too far Away from the flame.

468
00:23:48.815 --> 00:23:50.755
He was always imp perfect communion when the Spirit,

469
00:23:51.695 --> 00:23:53.555
and he didn't give in to the temptation

470
00:23:53.555 --> 00:23:56.515
of self glorification in the wilderness.

471
00:23:59.125 --> 00:24:01.865
He did it perfectly. He walked perfectly in the spirit.

472
00:24:04.395 --> 00:24:05.815
And so we see this morning

473
00:24:05.845 --> 00:24:08.415
that we might be thoughtful in zeal,

474
00:24:09.235 --> 00:24:12.775
or we might be just doing things for zeal sake.

475
00:24:13.715 --> 00:24:16.055
We might drift far from the flame

476
00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:21.735
and we cool down to being lukewarm or we might boil over

477
00:24:22.035 --> 00:24:24.015
and self-glorification and self service.

478
00:24:24.835 --> 00:24:27.215
But this last phrase ties it all together.

479
00:24:28.765 --> 00:24:30.575
Paul writes to us to serve the Lord.

480
00:24:32.325 --> 00:24:35.015
It's in serving the Lord that those things come together.

481
00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:38.655
It unites our spirit.

482
00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:41.175
It gives us a plum

483
00:24:41.765 --> 00:24:46.595
because as we serve the Lord, we have one focus.

484
00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:53.455
We have one purpose. And Paul uses this closing

485
00:24:53.455 --> 00:24:57.095
phrase in this verse to narrow in and focus our zeal

486
00:24:57.155 --> 00:24:58.455
and focus our fervency.

487
00:24:59.275 --> 00:25:02.095
And I use, I love the fact that he uses the word serve

488
00:25:02.565 --> 00:25:05.335
because Paul referred to himself as a servant.

489
00:25:06.795 --> 00:25:08.015
He saw himself that way.

490
00:25:08.105 --> 00:25:10.495
First and foremost, he identified in the epistles

491
00:25:10.495 --> 00:25:12.375
as an apostle or of Christ.

492
00:25:13.275 --> 00:25:15.815
But then the second most frequent title that he uses is that

493
00:25:15.815 --> 00:25:20.135
of servant or even bond servant a doo.

494
00:25:21.195 --> 00:25:22.855
And it wasn't just the way he identified.

495
00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:25.895
He lived it out in what he did everywhere that he went.

496
00:25:27.515 --> 00:25:30.215
And again, in our church, we have so many

497
00:25:30.215 --> 00:25:31.815
that serve so well.

498
00:25:33.805 --> 00:25:35.975
It's because of service that you see all

499
00:25:35.975 --> 00:25:37.895
of these decorations around us.

500
00:25:38.715 --> 00:25:41.415
People could have spent their weekend anyway they wanted to,

501
00:25:42.115 --> 00:25:45.015
but they chose to come and help serve the Lord.

502
00:25:46.035 --> 00:25:48.895
But to put a face, to put a person

503
00:25:50.525 --> 00:25:53.065
for service in Henderson Hills, I think about Jill Wagman.

504
00:25:53.925 --> 00:25:56.505
Jill's a faithful member of Henderson Hills

505
00:25:56.525 --> 00:25:58.625
and also a servant in our congregation

506
00:25:59.045 --> 00:26:00.545
and a member of our staff.

507
00:26:01.525 --> 00:26:05.145
She uses every hour of her workday and many hours

508
00:26:05.155 --> 00:26:07.865
after her workday in serving the church,

509
00:26:09.645 --> 00:26:11.345
She serves the Lord in what she does,

510
00:26:11.485 --> 00:26:13.265
but it's also who she is.

511
00:26:14.035 --> 00:26:18.145
She's a servant and her staff position, she leads

512
00:26:18.165 --> 00:26:21.345
and oversees the teams that plan events that care

513
00:26:21.405 --> 00:26:24.105
for our property, that organize the cafe

514
00:26:24.325 --> 00:26:26.265
and provide for so much that goes on

515
00:26:26.265 --> 00:26:27.625
around here at Henderson Hills.

516
00:26:29.135 --> 00:26:31.395
But it's not just in the leading that she serves.

517
00:26:31.575 --> 00:26:35.995
She jumps in on the cooking and the cleaning, the setting up

518
00:26:35.995 --> 00:26:39.115
and the tearing down from coordination

519
00:26:39.115 --> 00:26:42.235
and planning to the end of the execution.

520
00:26:42.285 --> 00:26:44.205
She's there. And I'm certain

521
00:26:44.205 --> 00:26:45.725
that Jill could apply these skills

522
00:26:46.165 --> 00:26:47.245
anywhere that she chooses.

523
00:26:47.865 --> 00:26:49.485
And in a dozen of different settings.

524
00:26:50.225 --> 00:26:52.125
Yet she chooses to serve the Lord here

525
00:26:52.905 --> 00:26:55.885
at Henderson Hills this summer.

526
00:26:55.945 --> 00:26:57.245
We have other examples. We have students,

527
00:26:57.755 --> 00:26:59.205
high school students who have chosen

528
00:26:59.225 --> 00:27:01.605
to serve in the summer leadership program here

529
00:27:01.645 --> 00:27:04.805
through our student ministry, that they could have gotten a

530
00:27:04.805 --> 00:27:06.325
job at any of a number of different places.

531
00:27:06.465 --> 00:27:10.265
And yet they've given themselves to serving the Lord.

532
00:27:12.925 --> 00:27:15.705
And this week, this week, this building's gonna be filled

533
00:27:15.975 --> 00:27:19.385
with people in colorful T-shirts serving the Lord

534
00:27:19.565 --> 00:27:23.785
and sharing the love of Jesus Christ with boys

535
00:27:23.785 --> 00:27:26.145
and girls from our church and from our community.

536
00:27:28.335 --> 00:27:30.995
You see, one can be zealous for the wrong things.

537
00:27:32.095 --> 00:27:34.035
One can be lazy and zeal.

538
00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:36.675
You can get in the ditch on those sides.

539
00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:39.395
One can be fueled by the things of the world

540
00:27:39.395 --> 00:27:40.595
and not fueled by the spirit.

541
00:27:41.535 --> 00:27:43.915
But as we serve the Lord, it sinners us.

542
00:27:44.095 --> 00:27:46.075
It gives a purpose to those things that we do.

543
00:27:47.095 --> 00:27:49.555
And we see Paul as a servant of the Lord.

544
00:27:50.615 --> 00:27:52.155
But I thought it might be interesting to also

545
00:27:52.155 --> 00:27:54.595
to have an Old Testament example of

546
00:27:54.595 --> 00:27:56.675
what it looks like to serve the Lord.

547
00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:59.915
And so you remember Moses, Moses born

548
00:28:00.575 --> 00:28:04.715
during a rough season, put in the river by his mother

549
00:28:04.815 --> 00:28:07.795
for protection and then taken in, fostered

550
00:28:07.795 --> 00:28:11.395
and ultimately adopted by the wife of Pharaoh.

551
00:28:13.145 --> 00:28:15.815
Moses grew up and affluence.

552
00:28:15.815 --> 00:28:18.175
He grew up in the um,

553
00:28:19.005 --> 00:28:20.815
with the Pharaoh in the palace.

554
00:28:22.275 --> 00:28:25.855
He grew up to be, uh, prominent in Egypt.

555
00:28:26.985 --> 00:28:29.045
He had every opportunity to serve himself

556
00:28:29.065 --> 00:28:32.405
and every reason to, and yet God, God called him

557
00:28:32.405 --> 00:28:34.445
to serve the Lord through the burning bush.

558
00:28:34.505 --> 00:28:36.885
He called Moses out of that to something different,

559
00:28:37.465 --> 00:28:40.645
to serve the Lord with fervor and with zeal.

560
00:28:41.865 --> 00:28:45.245
Now we see Moses not do that perfectly all the time,

561
00:28:46.185 --> 00:28:49.165
but the Lord used him to lead the nation of Israel

562
00:28:49.465 --> 00:28:51.565
and to show them what it looked like to serve the Lord

563
00:28:52.025 --> 00:28:55.845
and to serve the Lord with a singularity of devotion.

564
00:28:57.225 --> 00:29:00.485
And Deuteronomy chapter 11, he writes it this way.

565
00:29:02.105 --> 00:29:04.805
And if you will indeed obey my commandments,

566
00:29:05.035 --> 00:29:07.205
that I command you today to love the Lord

567
00:29:07.785 --> 00:29:09.565
and to serve him with all of your heart

568
00:29:09.785 --> 00:29:13.685
and with all of your so soul, he'll give the rain

569
00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:16.405
for your land in its season, the early rain

570
00:29:16.825 --> 00:29:19.725
and the later rain that you may gather in your grain

571
00:29:19.985 --> 00:29:21.845
and your wine and your oil.

572
00:29:23.505 --> 00:29:26.885
You see, Moses knew that there was a singularity of service

573
00:29:26.955 --> 00:29:29.045
that happened before the Lord, that we could,

574
00:29:29.265 --> 00:29:31.965
we could not be distracted by the world around us

575
00:29:32.025 --> 00:29:34.325
or the the enemies that attack.

576
00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:37.485
And he passed that devotion, that singularity

577
00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:38.845
of devotion down to Joshua.

578
00:29:39.985 --> 00:29:41.245
You remember that as a nation

579
00:29:41.245 --> 00:29:43.085
of Israel entered into the promised land.

580
00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:44.845
They weren't free from distractions,

581
00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:47.685
they weren't free from persecutions,

582
00:29:48.555 --> 00:29:50.125
they weren't free from hard times.

583
00:29:51.865 --> 00:29:54.805
And what they faced is not unlike what we faced today.

584
00:29:56.465 --> 00:29:58.205
And as we get to the end of that book,

585
00:29:59.195 --> 00:30:01.325
there's this famous line from Joshua.

586
00:30:02.305 --> 00:30:04.845
He says, as for me in my house, we will serve the Lord.

587
00:30:06.865 --> 00:30:08.085
Now, Joshua probably didn't have

588
00:30:08.085 --> 00:30:09.365
that printed on his coffee cup.

589
00:30:10.545 --> 00:30:12.925
It wasn't a a cross ditch on his desk.

590
00:30:14.945 --> 00:30:18.845
It was a call and it was a challenge that he laid out.

591
00:30:19.665 --> 00:30:21.205
I'm gonna read this whole section for you.

592
00:30:21.785 --> 00:30:25.645
So this is Joshua chapter 24, verses 14 through 17.

593
00:30:25.705 --> 00:30:28.365
It says, this is Joshua speaking to the people.

594
00:30:28.385 --> 00:30:30.325
He says, now therefore, fear the Lord

595
00:30:30.345 --> 00:30:33.445
and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness.

596
00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:37.205
Put away the gods that your father serve beyond the river

597
00:30:38.065 --> 00:30:40.245
and in Egypt and serve the Lord.

598
00:30:41.025 --> 00:30:43.325
And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord,

599
00:30:43.345 --> 00:30:45.245
choose this day whom you'll serve,

600
00:30:45.675 --> 00:30:48.325
whether the gods your Father served in the region

601
00:30:48.325 --> 00:30:51.285
beyond the river or the gods of the Amorites

602
00:30:51.305 --> 00:30:52.365
and whose land you dwell.

603
00:30:53.465 --> 00:30:57.365
But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

604
00:30:58.695 --> 00:31:01.225
Then the people answered far be it from us,

605
00:31:01.225 --> 00:31:03.585
that we should forsake the Lord and serve other gods.

606
00:31:04.565 --> 00:31:07.585
For it is for the, it is the Lord, our God who brought us

607
00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:11.785
and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, out

608
00:31:11.785 --> 00:31:13.665
of the house of slavery, and

609
00:31:13.665 --> 00:31:15.265
who did great signs in our sight

610
00:31:15.645 --> 00:31:17.665
and preserved us in all the way that we went.

611
00:31:18.645 --> 00:31:20.625
And among all the peoples through whom we passed.

612
00:31:21.125 --> 00:31:24.065
And the Lord drove us, drove out before us, all the peoples

613
00:31:24.065 --> 00:31:25.385
and the Amorites who lived in the land.

614
00:31:25.575 --> 00:31:28.825
Therefore, we will serve the Lord for he is our God.

615
00:31:30.645 --> 00:31:32.585
You see, they recognized that it was the Lord

616
00:31:32.645 --> 00:31:34.225
who had pulled them up out of the ditch.

617
00:31:35.175 --> 00:31:36.625
They realized that it was the Lord

618
00:31:37.085 --> 00:31:38.905
who had put them back on the path

619
00:31:38.905 --> 00:31:41.945
and who had actually cleared the path before them

620
00:31:42.645 --> 00:31:44.025
and was making their way straight.

621
00:31:45.735 --> 00:31:47.705
They had attacks from every side.

622
00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:49.345
They had distractions from every side.

623
00:31:49.345 --> 00:31:51.265
And yet they chose to serve the Lord.

624
00:31:52.905 --> 00:31:54.325
And if you know very much about the rest

625
00:31:54.325 --> 00:31:57.005
of the Old Testament, they continue to need realignment

626
00:31:57.345 --> 00:31:58.885
and refining from time to time.

627
00:32:00.865 --> 00:32:02.845
But again, in serving the Lord, we have Jesus

628
00:32:03.065 --> 00:32:05.805
as our ultimate, our pinnacle example.

629
00:32:06.745 --> 00:32:09.525
He lived out perfectly what it looks like to live

630
00:32:09.765 --> 00:32:12.245
with singularity of focus in serving the Lord.

631
00:32:14.705 --> 00:32:19.295
And in one verse, he says it in John chapter five,

632
00:32:19.295 --> 00:32:24.135
verse 30, he tells his disciples, I can do nothing on my own

633
00:32:25.115 --> 00:32:26.575
as I hear, I judge.

634
00:32:26.755 --> 00:32:30.975
And my judgment is just because I seek not my own will,

635
00:32:31.515 --> 00:32:33.695
but the will of him who sent me.

636
00:32:35.195 --> 00:32:37.135
You see, Jesus served the Lord during his life

637
00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:39.925
and ministry on this earth and in the flesh.

638
00:32:40.945 --> 00:32:44.325
But he served as a perfect imprint of the invisible God.

639
00:32:45.825 --> 00:32:48.485
He, he served the Lord with a singularity of focus.

640
00:32:48.585 --> 00:32:52.015
His whole goal was to point to the Father.

641
00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:56.615
But how does that keep us upright?

642
00:32:56.915 --> 00:32:58.815
How does that keep us between the ditches?

643
00:32:58.835 --> 00:33:01.335
How does serving the Lord do that?

644
00:33:02.125 --> 00:33:04.855
Well, it causes everything else to fade away.

645
00:33:05.475 --> 00:33:09.135
It causes us to remember who we indeed are serving.

646
00:33:10.115 --> 00:33:12.255
And Paul, Paul tells us in Ephesians

647
00:33:12.255 --> 00:33:13.535
chapter six, he writes it this way.

648
00:33:14.675 --> 00:33:18.575
He says, bonds servants obey your earthly masters with fear

649
00:33:18.675 --> 00:33:21.535
and trembling with a sincere heart as you would Christ.

650
00:33:22.595 --> 00:33:25.015
Not by way of I service as people pleasers,

651
00:33:25.995 --> 00:33:30.095
but as bond servants of Christ, doing the will

652
00:33:30.095 --> 00:33:34.895
of God from the heart, rendering service with a goodwill as

653
00:33:34.895 --> 00:33:37.295
to the Lord and not to man.

654
00:33:40.105 --> 00:33:44.525
So the beauty of being zealous, the beauty

655
00:33:44.545 --> 00:33:45.925
of being fervent in spirit

656
00:33:46.905 --> 00:33:50.365
and the beauty of serving the Lord is that it is perfectly

657
00:33:50.365 --> 00:33:53.285
what God has called us to do is the way

658
00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:54.725
that he wants us to go.

659
00:33:56.705 --> 00:34:01.445
The rub is everything in our flesh pushes back against that.

660
00:34:02.425 --> 00:34:03.925
Our flesh wants to be lazy.

661
00:34:04.825 --> 00:34:07.445
Our flesh wants to be lukewarm.

662
00:34:08.345 --> 00:34:11.365
Our flesh wants to serve our flesh.

663
00:34:12.825 --> 00:34:14.765
But we're reminded in one John

664
00:34:16.635 --> 00:34:19.615
and he says in one John chapter four, little children,

665
00:34:20.915 --> 00:34:24.735
you are from God and you have overcome them.

666
00:34:26.275 --> 00:34:29.375
For he who is in you is greater than he

667
00:34:29.725 --> 00:34:30.735
that is in the world.

668
00:34:32.795 --> 00:34:34.655
And so we're reminded that we're not called

669
00:34:34.655 --> 00:34:35.935
to do this on our own.

670
00:34:38.595 --> 00:34:42.015
We remember that Peter and his zeal fell apart,

671
00:34:44.135 --> 00:34:45.955
but very kindly and very graciously.

672
00:34:45.955 --> 00:34:50.235
He was restored. He was restored to serve the Lord.

673
00:34:51.735 --> 00:34:56.555
And we see that fervency of Apollos begin

674
00:34:56.555 --> 00:34:57.595
to cause him to drift

675
00:35:01.175 --> 00:35:03.155
to the temptation of being self-serving.

676
00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:06.195
But we see him restored and refined

677
00:35:06.215 --> 00:35:09.155
and used to serve the Lord.

678
00:35:11.145 --> 00:35:14.085
You see, serving the Lord puts us in the middle of the road.

679
00:35:15.345 --> 00:35:17.245
And this morning, whether you feel like you need

680
00:35:17.245 --> 00:35:18.645
to be pulled out of the ditch

681
00:35:20.105 --> 00:35:24.285
or whether you need to be aligned, know that it's in Christ

682
00:35:24.285 --> 00:35:25.685
that we find that salvation.

683
00:35:26.555 --> 00:35:28.925
It's in the Holy Spirit, that we find that source

684
00:35:29.785 --> 00:35:31.125
for our fervency,

685
00:35:33.545 --> 00:35:36.005
and it's for his purpose, for the glory of His name,

686
00:35:36.475 --> 00:35:40.165
that he works all of those things out in our lives.

687
00:35:41.675 --> 00:35:43.695
So this morning, let us go to the Lord in prayer.

688
00:35:44.755 --> 00:35:47.775
Let us pray that as we serve, we would do it with the zeal

689
00:35:47.775 --> 00:35:50.735
that He's called us to and the fervency of the Spirit.

690
00:35:53.835 --> 00:35:57.935
Father God, your word is very clear to us that our life

691
00:35:57.995 --> 00:36:00.935
and you should look different than the world around us.

692
00:36:03.395 --> 00:36:04.855
And when we're laying in the ditch,

693
00:36:05.645 --> 00:36:10.135
when the world is 90 degrees to us, that you pull us out,

694
00:36:10.755 --> 00:36:12.175
you put us back on the path.

695
00:36:14.475 --> 00:36:15.775
And Father, as we're on that path,

696
00:36:15.775 --> 00:36:16.775
you don't just leave us there.

697
00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:19.495
You give us a zeal. You give us your spirit to fuel us,

698
00:36:20.355 --> 00:36:24.095
to give us a rolling boil, an energy

699
00:36:24.435 --> 00:36:27.335
to serve others in your name and for your glory.

700
00:36:27.335 --> 00:36:29.535
Father, we pray that as we serve as a church,

701
00:36:31.565 --> 00:36:33.775
that it would be for your glory.

702
00:36:34.795 --> 00:36:37.655
And Lord, this morning, thank you for the brothers

703
00:36:37.655 --> 00:36:39.055
and sisters that are here.

704
00:36:39.585 --> 00:36:43.175
Thank you for those who have come to hear of your good news

705
00:36:43.175 --> 00:36:44.735
and your name maybe for the first time.

706
00:36:44.755 --> 00:36:46.615
And I pray, father, that your spirit would work

707
00:36:47.515 --> 00:36:50.015
to fan into flame, that which you've put into us.

708
00:36:51.195 --> 00:36:53.535
That's in Christ name we pray, amen.

709
00:36:54.915 --> 00:36:57.175
And my brother, Ryan Whitaker, is gonna come

710
00:36:57.175 --> 00:36:59.095
and lead us in the Lord's Supper together.
