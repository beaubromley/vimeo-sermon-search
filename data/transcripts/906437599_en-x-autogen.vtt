WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.795 --> 00:00:01.725
Good evening church.

2
00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:03.645
Uh, my name's TR Lewis

3
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.765
and, uh, we're gonna study about the Trinity tonight.

4
00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:08.485
It's a pleasure to be here with everybody.

5
00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:13.205
This feels, uh, good. I was gone last week, so this is new.

6
00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.405
It's not early set up for Good Friday, I'm told, but, um,

7
00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:19.445
but we've got a condense thing, so if you guys wanna,

8
00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:21.645
wanna move in close, uh,

9
00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:23.365
whatever you wanna sit as comfortable.

10
00:00:23.645 --> 00:00:27.285
I just got back last week, got back Monday from teaching,

11
00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:30.965
um, HTI, teaching the, the Nicaragua HTI,

12
00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:33.685
and, um, for those of you that don't know, HTI

13
00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:35.005
as a Henderson Training Institute,

14
00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:37.085
and, uh, started several years ago

15
00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:38.485
with Wednesday night classes.

16
00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:42.245
So Wednesday night classes to teach us as brothers

17
00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:44.125
and sisters in Christ, uh, how

18
00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:48.365
to study the Bible about church history, ecclesiology, um,

19
00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:51.165
many different topics all across the spectrum.

20
00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:53.605
And so the first class I ever took, uh,

21
00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:56.285
and that was a biblical theology class taught

22
00:00:56.365 --> 00:00:58.085
by Aaron Ferguson and Matt Felton.

23
00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:00.325
And it was the first semester of HTI.

24
00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:05.285
And, uh, to this day, um, is, is one of the,

25
00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:08.565
the semesters probably that, that grew my faith

26
00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:10.765
and the love for God's word the most in studying that.

27
00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:14.525
And I remember that in the, uh, there's a book

28
00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:16.165
that accomp accompanied

29
00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:18.325
that class was called Dominion and Dynasty.

30
00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:19.645
And I started reading that book,

31
00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:22.725
and I got about halfway through the first chapter on Texted

32
00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:24.005
Matt and I said, dude, I'm out.

33
00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:27.645
I don't, I, I, this is hard, and these words are hard,

34
00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:29.445
and like, I should need a dictionary to read a book.

35
00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:32.285
And so he said, hang in, bear with me.

36
00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.525
It's like, finish the chapter, go the second.

37
00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:37.125
It's worth it, and it's good. And I did.

38
00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:39.125
And it was, and, um,

39
00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:41.325
and lessons from that class was still learned.

40
00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:43.965
So we've continued that on that, that what

41
00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:45.885
that happened is then about seven years ago,

42
00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:50.085
that translated into, uh, a seminary style experience

43
00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:52.645
for pastors and church leaders in Nicaragua.

44
00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:57.725
And, um, and so this last week, this year,

45
00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:01.005
just last week, we started our fourth round of students.

46
00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:04.125
And so we've graduated three classes out.

47
00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:06.325
So we've graduated somewhere around 80, I think,

48
00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.685
or 90 students, somewhere in that.

49
00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:09.965
And some have gone on to further admissions, training,

50
00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:12.205
other experiences, but they've gone back

51
00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:14.805
and taken back these lessons to their communities all

52
00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.245
around northern Nicaragua and Southern Honduras.

53
00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:19.765
So we started each class,

54
00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:21.645
this is a long-winded introduction,

55
00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:23.845
but we started each class last week,

56
00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.045
each day last week we taught,

57
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:26.325
I taught through the New Testament.

58
00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:29.285
So we studied Matthew through Revelation study,

59
00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:30.365
the whole New Testament.

60
00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:33.085
And, but we started each day praying for Henderson Hills,

61
00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:37.405
praying for the elders, um, by name, praying for situations

62
00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:38.765
and families in our church.

63
00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:42.765
And, um, the pastors, the leaders, the the church members

64
00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:44.085
that were there would stand and would pray

65
00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:45.885
for us as a church.

66
00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:47.525
And I told 'em, I knew that we were praying for them.

67
00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:50.285
So I'd love to start tonight, um, by us standing

68
00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:52.885
and praying together, and I'll lead us.

69
00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:57.125
And, um, as I'm praying, if you feel called

70
00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:58.325
to pray out loud, that's great.

71
00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:01.725
If you want to pray silently, that's, uh, that's good too.

72
00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:05.925
Um, two, two, uh, of the students that you can pray for.

73
00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:08.125
And if we have time later, I can tell you the stories.

74
00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:11.605
If you wanna talk later. One named Bayardo, uh, amazing man,

75
00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:13.285
life transformed by Christ.

76
00:03:14.065 --> 00:03:16.845
And, uh, pray for him as he goes back, there continues

77
00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:19.765
to be attack and temptations that come on by Yardo.

78
00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:22.045
Uh, he has an amazing story of transformation.

79
00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:26.125
Number two is Roger. And Roger was probably the one of the,

80
00:03:26.265 --> 00:03:29.845
um, youngest Christians probably in the class.

81
00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:31.965
And I was going pretty quickly through material.

82
00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:35.165
And Roger, I think at times got a little bit intimidated

83
00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:36.725
by the other students

84
00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:40.125
and pastors that had been doing this for a long time.

85
00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:44.725
And so, uh, Roger needed the encouragement of the spirit.

86
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:46.645
And so if you'll pray for Roger for encouragement

87
00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:48.205
and bayardo for perseverance,

88
00:03:48.865 --> 00:03:50.005
father, we come to you tonight.

89
00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:51.565
We thank you for, uh,

90
00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:52.805
this time to come together as a church.

91
00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:56.365
Lord, we know that you are in control of all things.

92
00:03:56.705 --> 00:03:59.045
Uh, we give you praise for the way

93
00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:01.325
that you've answered prayer through the,

94
00:04:01.465 --> 00:04:04.245
the HTI in Nicaragua, the studies, the digging deeper

95
00:04:04.245 --> 00:04:05.605
that we're doing here tonight.

96
00:04:06.105 --> 00:04:07.245
Uh, father, we give you praise

97
00:04:07.545 --> 00:04:09.405
for Pastor John's surgery going.

98
00:04:09.435 --> 00:04:11.925
Well, I thank you that you were with him, uh, through that

99
00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:13.925
and continue to do so through his recovery.

100
00:04:14.745 --> 00:04:17.245
Father, we ask for Roger that you would continue

101
00:04:17.245 --> 00:04:19.205
to encourage him as he studies your word, father

102
00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:21.445
as he opens it, that his eyes will be illuminated

103
00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:22.845
to the truths of who you are,

104
00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:25.005
and that he would be encouraged to share

105
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:26.085
that with people around him.

106
00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:27.685
Lord, lift up Bayardo.

107
00:04:28.545 --> 00:04:30.285
Um, we know

108
00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:32.925
that you have transformed his life in an amazing way.

109
00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:36.725
And so I pray, father, that you would continue to refine

110
00:04:36.825 --> 00:04:41.205
and strengthen him and make him a powerful, uh, testimony

111
00:04:41.265 --> 00:04:43.685
of your spirit at work, in his community

112
00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:46.885
and, um, in his region and, and all across the country.

113
00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:51.005
Lord, tonight, as we, um, study more about who you are,

114
00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:52.565
that your father, son,

115
00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:54.765
and Spirit, three in one, um,

116
00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:57.365
as we look at passages from your word

117
00:04:57.365 --> 00:04:59.925
and how you've revealed that, um,

118
00:05:00.075 --> 00:05:02.405
that you would enlighten our hearts

119
00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:06.845
and our minds, help us to be fresh, help us Lord, to, um,

120
00:05:07.435 --> 00:05:10.525
receive and to process Lord,

121
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:15.005
and help us to trust, uh, when we bump up against the end

122
00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:17.845
of, of what our minds can comprehend,

123
00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:19.205
that we'll trust you with the rest.

124
00:05:19.665 --> 00:05:23.005
And it's in Jesus and we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you guys.

125
00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:24.005
Thank

126
00:05:28.675 --> 00:05:30.685
Lest you think that the enemy is not at work.

127
00:05:30.745 --> 00:05:32.965
He is. Um,

128
00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:38.565
whenever we have things that the Lord has called us to do,

129
00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:43.005
he throws, um, curve balls and, um,

130
00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:45.805
but we don't have to worry about hitting those curve balls.

131
00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:49.485
Isn't that a good truth? Um, the Lord goes before us.

132
00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:53.085
He prepares the Lord, uh, has a plan and has a way.

133
00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:54.485
And so it's good.

134
00:05:54.485 --> 00:05:55.965
Tonight we're gonna talk about the Trinity.

135
00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:59.365
I I bet most of you, uh, got to hear the sermon

136
00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:02.805
and have thought well, about that, um, since that time.

137
00:06:03.105 --> 00:06:06.605
And so what we're gonna do is, um,

138
00:06:08.615 --> 00:06:10.395
is kind of dive back into some of that.

139
00:06:11.015 --> 00:06:14.195
And, but also go, uh, dig deeper.

140
00:06:14.325 --> 00:06:16.315
We're gonna go deeper into the Trinity, uh,

141
00:06:16.415 --> 00:06:19.795
as it says up there and, um, and,

142
00:06:19.895 --> 00:06:21.715
and unpack some Old Testament

143
00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:22.955
scriptures that point us forward.

144
00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:27.675
We're gonna look at, um, the persons of the father,

145
00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:30.115
the person of the son, the person of the Spirit,

146
00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:32.555
and how they come together as three in one,

147
00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:33.755
how that's revealed in scripture.

148
00:06:34.455 --> 00:06:36.155
And so, as I was preparing

149
00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:38.795
and studying, um, one of the curve balls

150
00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:40.195
that got thrown my way was

151
00:06:40.195 --> 00:06:42.915
that our pilots decided it wasn't a good idea

152
00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:45.275
to land in Oklahoma City on Sunday night.

153
00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:47.195
And so we got to go back to Houston.

154
00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:49.275
And so that gained me some more study

155
00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:51.115
time and the Houston Airport.

156
00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:52.755
And so praise God for that.

157
00:06:52.815 --> 00:06:57.355
But one of the, um, one of the teachers

158
00:06:57.355 --> 00:07:00.235
that I was reading from the Gospel Coalition, he said that,

159
00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:02.035
that everything that you need

160
00:07:02.035 --> 00:07:04.115
to understand the Trinity you have in your mind,

161
00:07:04.135 --> 00:07:07.235
in your heart, in your experience, and in God's word.

162
00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:11.955
And that, that, that we have what we need to understand

163
00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:14.155
what God is revealing.

164
00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:18.395
And, and God hasn't revealed everything about the Trinity,

165
00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:21.035
and we can't understand everything about the Trinity,

166
00:07:21.255 --> 00:07:23.315
but we've been given through the Holy Spirit

167
00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:24.715
and through our mind and through our heart,

168
00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:27.875
through God's Word, what we need to understand for today.

169
00:07:28.505 --> 00:07:31.275
Okay? And so that was, that was an encouragement to me

170
00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:34.475
because I think once we bump up against that, once we get

171
00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:35.875
to the end of what we can understand

172
00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:39.195
and we start to explain those mysteries, then

173
00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:41.075
that's when we get into false teaching.

174
00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:42.555
That's where we get into

175
00:07:42.735 --> 00:07:44.795
to these faulty analogies that fall short.

176
00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:46.395
And there's one, if there's one thing I love

177
00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:47.595
to do, it's to make analogies.

178
00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:49.675
And I'm forever in clinic when I'm talking

179
00:07:49.675 --> 00:07:52.715
to patients about medical things, trying to describe it

180
00:07:52.715 --> 00:07:54.035
to 'em as if it were a truck

181
00:07:54.615 --> 00:07:56.715
or a tree or something like that.

182
00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:58.515
And at some level, those all fall short.

183
00:07:58.935 --> 00:08:01.475
And that's okay when you're talking about a, a broken leg.

184
00:08:01.475 --> 00:08:03.195
But it's not okay when we're talking about the Trinity.

185
00:08:03.335 --> 00:08:07.595
So rather than try to do that, um, and, and,

186
00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:11.075
and try to find these things that are imperfect conclusions

187
00:08:11.135 --> 00:08:13.555
or assumptions, we want to really, um,

188
00:08:14.215 --> 00:08:16.035
be solid on the things that we can know.

189
00:08:16.055 --> 00:08:17.115
And so that's what I wanna do.

190
00:08:17.115 --> 00:08:19.475
And then remember that God is greater, he's higher,

191
00:08:20.295 --> 00:08:22.915
and then we can have confidence in what we need to know.

192
00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:25.235
There is one picture though, that I wanted to show tonight.

193
00:08:25.315 --> 00:08:28.915
I think Neil may have it on a slide where Jonathan, um,

194
00:08:29.015 --> 00:08:30.155
if we have it up there.

195
00:08:30.705 --> 00:08:31.995
Yeah. So it's on the side.

196
00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:36.555
And so this was, um, one picture that I,

197
00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:39.075
that I came across that the more I kind of thought about it,

198
00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:40.395
I really, really liked.

199
00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:44.035
And, um, and I tried

200
00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:46.395
to trace this one in particular is really nice.

201
00:08:46.595 --> 00:08:48.755
'cause if you can, if you trace that with your finger,

202
00:08:49.785 --> 00:08:51.515
it's all one line, right?

203
00:08:51.785 --> 00:08:53.475
It's perfectly continuous.

204
00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:56.445
Yet, there, there, it looks like there are a lot

205
00:08:56.445 --> 00:08:57.805
of things going on, right?

206
00:08:57.805 --> 00:08:59.245
There are a lot of shapes, there are a lot of things,

207
00:08:59.245 --> 00:09:01.245
but really it's made up of three arcs.

208
00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:05.965
So there are three arcs that make up that whole form,

209
00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:08.005
but they're all one.

210
00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:10.525
And you, you never get outside of that shape.

211
00:09:10.525 --> 00:09:12.765
And yet you can experience all three arcs

212
00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:14.405
and all three arcs interact,

213
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.765
and they actually make something more,

214
00:09:17.235 --> 00:09:19.485
more beautiful than they would be if you just took

215
00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:22.525
that one arc as a, in isolation.

216
00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:24.125
But they're all together. So, and,

217
00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:26.165
and that even this even falls short, right?

218
00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:28.565
But, but as I looked at that, I think what you, you see

219
00:09:28.565 --> 00:09:31.125
that probably on church letterhead and, and our brothers

220
00:09:31.385 --> 00:09:34.685
and sisters in Loudoun County, Virginia, this is on their,

221
00:09:35.155 --> 00:09:38.245
this is, uh, their church is logo Trinity Loudoun.

222
00:09:38.905 --> 00:09:41.845
Um, but it was good, it was good for me to look at that.

223
00:09:41.905 --> 00:09:43.045
So I, I may just leave that

224
00:09:43.045 --> 00:09:44.205
up there tonight while I'm talking.

225
00:09:44.325 --> 00:09:46.165
I don't have any other slides, um, to show.

226
00:09:46.225 --> 00:09:50.885
But the truth is that God is one we serve

227
00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:53.725
and are created by

228
00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:56.445
and loved by one God

229
00:09:57.545 --> 00:09:59.725
who has revealed himself to us

230
00:10:00.025 --> 00:10:03.845
and to creation in three persons of Father, son, and Spirit.

231
00:10:03.845 --> 00:10:06.845
And so we're gonna walk through that. Um, for those of you

232
00:10:06.845 --> 00:10:09.605
who maybe didn't read the ene creed today, we're,

233
00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:11.205
I'm gonna read that, uh, for you.

234
00:10:11.905 --> 00:10:14.365
And it says, it says, we believe in one God,

235
00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:16.685
the Father Almighty, maker of heaven

236
00:10:16.745 --> 00:10:19.525
and earth, of all things visible

237
00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:22.405
and invisible, one God.

238
00:10:23.305 --> 00:10:25.965
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only sin

239
00:10:25.965 --> 00:10:28.085
of God begotten from the Father,

240
00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:32.205
before all ages, God from God, light from light, true God,

241
00:10:32.205 --> 00:10:34.885
from true God begotten, not made

242
00:10:35.745 --> 00:10:37.605
of the same essence as the Father.

243
00:10:38.675 --> 00:10:40.445
Through him, all things were made

244
00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:42.485
for us and for our salvation.

245
00:10:42.485 --> 00:10:44.485
He came down from heaven, and he became

246
00:10:44.635 --> 00:10:46.285
incarnate by the Holy Spirit.

247
00:10:46.505 --> 00:10:49.285
And the Virgin Mary was made human.

248
00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:52.245
He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate.

249
00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:53.925
He was suffered and was buried.

250
00:10:54.185 --> 00:10:55.605
And on the third day, he rose again,

251
00:10:55.605 --> 00:10:56.645
according to the scriptures.

252
00:10:57.185 --> 00:10:58.285
He ascended it into heaven

253
00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.725
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

254
00:11:01.185 --> 00:11:02.445
And he will come again with glory

255
00:11:03.105 --> 00:11:04.805
to judge the living in the dead.

256
00:11:05.345 --> 00:11:06.645
His kingdom will never end.

257
00:11:07.465 --> 00:11:08.765
And we believe in the Holy Spirit,

258
00:11:09.025 --> 00:11:10.765
the Lord, the giver of life.

259
00:11:11.265 --> 00:11:13.565
He proceeds from the Father and the Son,

260
00:11:13.985 --> 00:11:15.245
and with the Father and the Son.

261
00:11:15.305 --> 00:11:17.005
He has worshiped and glorified.

262
00:11:17.785 --> 00:11:19.165
He spoke through the prophets.

263
00:11:20.065 --> 00:11:22.645
We believe in one holy, Catholic and apostolic church.

264
00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:26.125
We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins

265
00:11:26.505 --> 00:11:28.325
and look forward to the resurrection of the dead

266
00:11:28.325 --> 00:11:29.365
and the life of the world to come.

267
00:11:29.795 --> 00:11:34.485
Amen. And so as we see that, we see truths of the,

268
00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:36.205
of the Trinity unpacked.

269
00:11:36.205 --> 00:11:37.445
And and there was another creed,

270
00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:39.365
the ATAC creed that we studied.

271
00:11:39.425 --> 00:11:40.525
And I may come back to that later,

272
00:11:40.585 --> 00:11:42.765
but I want to have plenty of time for questions.

273
00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:47.645
So I wanna jump through, uh, some of the verses that, um,

274
00:11:48.195 --> 00:11:50.325
that, that open even in the Old Testament,

275
00:11:50.325 --> 00:11:51.565
open our eyes to the Trinity.

276
00:11:51.665 --> 00:11:53.780
But before even there, I wanted define some words.

277
00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:57.485
So we talk about one, uh, essence and three persons.

278
00:11:57.485 --> 00:11:58.685
We'll start with the persons.

279
00:11:59.665 --> 00:12:03.645
And, um, one of the things I was studying from RC Spro,

280
00:12:03.705 --> 00:12:05.405
he makes the point that language is dynamic.

281
00:12:06.065 --> 00:12:09.805
And what we think of as a person today, uh,

282
00:12:09.945 --> 00:12:13.645
is a little bit different and nuanced than the word person.

283
00:12:14.195 --> 00:12:16.605
Even in the time of the writing of scripture,

284
00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:20.365
or when a lot of the early church fathers were

285
00:12:20.915 --> 00:12:22.965
writing out early doctrines of the Trinity,

286
00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:26.765
when the creeds were being developed, when, um, tullian and,

287
00:12:26.765 --> 00:12:28.205
and he was one of the early pers,

288
00:12:28.235 --> 00:12:30.245
he's actually the first person to put the trinity,

289
00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:32.205
the word trinity in writing.

290
00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:35.485
And he defined it this way. He said, God is one substance

291
00:12:35.705 --> 00:12:39.045
or essence, and God is three persons, um,

292
00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.565
one essence, three persons.

293
00:12:40.565 --> 00:12:44.205
And so we, if we look at that word, the word persona in,

294
00:12:44.585 --> 00:12:45.605
in Latin or the,

295
00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:49.205
or even in that time of like Greek dramas, they would use

296
00:12:49.205 --> 00:12:51.845
that similar word to describe, um,

297
00:12:52.115 --> 00:12:54.645
this is the way they described it, like the different masks

298
00:12:55.195 --> 00:12:57.085
through which the, uh,

299
00:12:57.085 --> 00:12:59.805
actors would portray different characters in a,

300
00:12:59.825 --> 00:13:01.165
in a Greek drama, right?

301
00:13:01.165 --> 00:13:02.525
So they would have a limited number of actors,

302
00:13:02.705 --> 00:13:03.845
and there might be one actor

303
00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:05.325
that would play different roles.

304
00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:08.525
And so that actor would use a different voice,

305
00:13:08.725 --> 00:13:11.285
a different persona, and have a different mask.

306
00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:16.245
But it's the same, uh, actor behind all the different masks

307
00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:17.925
portrayed in different ways.

308
00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:19.765
And so that's, that's not a perfect way

309
00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:21.525
to think about the Trinity, but that gives you some insight.

310
00:13:21.525 --> 00:13:22.925
It's that outward expression,

311
00:13:22.925 --> 00:13:25.965
that word persona gives a sense in that day

312
00:13:25.965 --> 00:13:28.645
of the outward expression of a person.

313
00:13:29.545 --> 00:13:34.245
Um, even a person's possessions would, would roll up into

314
00:13:34.245 --> 00:13:35.445
that, into that idea.

315
00:13:35.505 --> 00:13:38.845
And so that's the, that's a little bit of the entomology

316
00:13:38.945 --> 00:13:40.925
around why we would say three persons.

317
00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:45.085
It's three, three, um, revelations of,

318
00:13:45.505 --> 00:13:48.965
of God, of our one God that he has three different persons

319
00:13:48.965 --> 00:13:50.045
or, or personas.

320
00:13:50.075 --> 00:13:52.565
It's the forward facing part, um,

321
00:13:52.575 --> 00:13:53.925
would be another way to say that.

322
00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:59.245
And then, um, the, the Greek word for essence would be,

323
00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:00.925
uh, it kind of walks out

324
00:14:00.925 --> 00:14:03.365
to the other word we use now for hypostasis.

325
00:14:03.705 --> 00:14:07.365
Um, it's, I can't even say it, right, but it's UUs

326
00:14:07.385 --> 00:14:09.525
or something like that in Latin, right?

327
00:14:09.865 --> 00:14:12.525
But it's, it, it's the, it's the stuff.

328
00:14:13.245 --> 00:14:15.245
I think that's of which something is made.

329
00:14:15.245 --> 00:14:18.485
And so God is one, in essence, God is, um,

330
00:14:18.905 --> 00:14:20.365
one in existence.

331
00:14:20.365 --> 00:14:24.005
There is only one God, three persons.

332
00:14:24.265 --> 00:14:27.525
And so that may not make it more clear, that make, it may,

333
00:14:27.665 --> 00:14:29.845
may make it more confusing,

334
00:14:30.305 --> 00:14:34.205
but we see God, um, in scripture singularly

335
00:14:34.425 --> 00:14:35.445
and express plu.

336
00:14:35.505 --> 00:14:38.045
And so there are different words even in the Old Testament.

337
00:14:38.045 --> 00:14:42.885
So the word Yahweh, um, that is, is kind of that word that,

338
00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.485
that we've kind of created Yahweh out of four letters

339
00:14:45.755 --> 00:14:49.805
that you can't even really say, uh, the name of God

340
00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:52.285
that way, but we've kind of created a Yahweh in the English.

341
00:14:52.665 --> 00:14:54.045
But that's a singular, right?

342
00:14:54.045 --> 00:14:57.285
That's a singular expression of our one God in essence

343
00:14:57.285 --> 00:15:00.005
that we are, we, we believe in one true God.

344
00:15:00.745 --> 00:15:03.805
And then there are times in scripture, like in Genesis one,

345
00:15:03.805 --> 00:15:05.685
where the word elim is used,

346
00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:10.525
and elim is actually a, a plural word in Hebrew.

347
00:15:10.825 --> 00:15:13.765
And so there's a plural expression of a, of a,

348
00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:16.085
of our triune God, of the three persons

349
00:15:16.805 --> 00:15:18.165
together in relationship.

350
00:15:18.745 --> 00:15:20.885
Um, one of the other ones that I came across, another word

351
00:15:20.885 --> 00:15:22.325
that was good for me to understand,

352
00:15:22.325 --> 00:15:25.685
because many people, um, that would try to deny the,

353
00:15:26.065 --> 00:15:28.205
the three and just say, God is one,

354
00:15:28.215 --> 00:15:30.725
we'll focus on Deuteronomy six.

355
00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:33.045
And in Deuteronomy six it says, the Lord

356
00:15:33.045 --> 00:15:34.245
of God, the Lord is one.

357
00:15:34.745 --> 00:15:37.125
And that word one is ihad,

358
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:40.925
or I think is how you pronounce it, but it's, it's EHAD.

359
00:15:41.585 --> 00:15:44.565
And the, and that's the type of one that means united.

360
00:15:45.235 --> 00:15:48.005
It's a, it's a, it gives a sense of one

361
00:15:48.025 --> 00:15:49.805
and unity, that word.

362
00:15:49.805 --> 00:15:51.165
And so it's actually the same word

363
00:15:51.425 --> 00:15:55.805
that's used in Genesis 2 24 to understand what it means

364
00:15:55.805 --> 00:15:58.005
for a man and woman to become one, to come together

365
00:15:58.105 --> 00:16:01.645
as one flesh, that same word, iad of a perf of a,

366
00:16:01.765 --> 00:16:03.405
a perfect in just 2 24.

367
00:16:03.405 --> 00:16:05.165
It's joining together. Um,

368
00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:08.245
but as we talk about, uh, God, it's an essence

369
00:16:08.265 --> 00:16:11.485
and perfect, uh, perfect, um, existence.

370
00:16:12.185 --> 00:16:14.005
Um, the next is Adonai.

371
00:16:14.005 --> 00:16:16.885
That's another word we see in scripture that we, um,

372
00:16:16.885 --> 00:16:17.885
sometimes think about.

373
00:16:17.905 --> 00:16:21.125
And seeing Adonai is actually a plural word.

374
00:16:21.195 --> 00:16:25.045
It's a plural for addon, which means Lord or master.

375
00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:30.165
So we even see that's a, a plural, like expressing God, uh,

376
00:16:30.305 --> 00:16:31.845
as three, but three in one.

377
00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:36.645
And it's views sometimes as a substitute for Yahweh

378
00:16:36.945 --> 00:16:41.085
as writers would be even, uh, feel a sense of irreverence

379
00:16:41.085 --> 00:16:43.165
to write out Yahweh.

380
00:16:43.165 --> 00:16:46.925
And so they would, they would substitute in Denai, um,

381
00:16:46.925 --> 00:16:48.765
throughout the Old Testament, it will start

382
00:16:48.765 --> 00:16:50.005
to pit into some of the scriptures.

383
00:16:50.005 --> 00:16:52.645
But we see, we see God the Father expressed,

384
00:16:52.665 --> 00:16:55.205
and we see God, uh, the Father all over.

385
00:16:55.225 --> 00:16:57.885
We see different manifestations of what are called

386
00:16:58.455 --> 00:16:59.925
Theos or Christoph.

387
00:17:00.705 --> 00:17:02.245
And I was, as I was studying back through this,

388
00:17:02.285 --> 00:17:04.085
I was remembering, I think the first time I was exposed to

389
00:17:04.085 --> 00:17:05.365
that was in that biblical theology

390
00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:07.445
class as we walked through that.

391
00:17:07.945 --> 00:17:11.085
And so the, the phrase used in many Old Testament scriptures

392
00:17:11.105 --> 00:17:12.325
is angel of the Lord.

393
00:17:12.985 --> 00:17:16.245
And so we see the angel of the Lord, uh, relating

394
00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:20.445
and talking as a person, um, about

395
00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:25.365
himself, about the trinity and with others.

396
00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:29.565
And so, um, there's a few, uh, we're gonna, I'm gonna go

397
00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:31.245
through a few passages.

398
00:17:31.305 --> 00:17:34.205
The first is, uh, if you flip Genesis 22,

399
00:17:35.045 --> 00:17:37.405
I put my bookmark in Nehemiah in case I had a hard time

400
00:17:37.405 --> 00:17:38.885
finding Nehemiah, so I'm gonna leave it there.

401
00:17:39.465 --> 00:17:42.885
But Genesis 22, if you guys turn to Genesis 22, chapter 12,

402
00:17:43.935 --> 00:17:46.085
we're gonna see, uh, this is Abraham.

403
00:17:46.145 --> 00:17:50.805
And so Abraham, um, had, has his son Isaac.

404
00:17:51.225 --> 00:17:52.885
So Isaac is the promised son,

405
00:17:53.265 --> 00:17:57.165
and he's been commanded to take Isaac up to build an altar

406
00:17:57.165 --> 00:18:00.885
and then to sacrifice Isaac on that altar.

407
00:18:00.885 --> 00:18:03.245
And so they take up wood, they take up what they need,

408
00:18:03.505 --> 00:18:05.525
but they don't take up any sacrifice,

409
00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.405
and they're on the mountain.

410
00:18:07.865 --> 00:18:10.685
And then you guys, many would know that the Lord

411
00:18:11.045 --> 00:18:12.965
provided a ram in the thicket.

412
00:18:13.345 --> 00:18:18.245
And then in, um, back in chapter 12, uh,

413
00:18:18.275 --> 00:18:20.885
Abraham has raised his knife and,

414
00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:24.205
and then says, the angel of the Lord called

415
00:18:24.205 --> 00:18:28.565
to him in verse 11 and said, Abraham, Abraham, here I am.

416
00:18:29.505 --> 00:18:31.725
And he said, do not lay your hand on the boy

417
00:18:31.725 --> 00:18:35.915
or do anything to him for now I know that you fear God

418
00:18:36.335 --> 00:18:38.435
and see, you have not withheld your son,

419
00:18:38.435 --> 00:18:39.915
your only son from me.

420
00:18:40.695 --> 00:18:42.635
And so there's this, there's this sense

421
00:18:42.635 --> 00:18:46.595
that he's talking about that you fear God

422
00:18:46.615 --> 00:18:49.475
and you haven't, he's identifying himself as God,

423
00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:50.715
this angel of the Lord.

424
00:18:50.775 --> 00:18:53.155
So it's a, it's a, it's a manifestation

425
00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:54.475
of, of God the Father.

426
00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.955
Um, we think of Theophany in this case, um,

427
00:18:58.755 --> 00:19:01.915
identifying himself as you've got withheld your son from me.

428
00:19:02.895 --> 00:19:07.355
And so we see, uh, that again in Exodus three, chapter two

429
00:19:07.945 --> 00:19:12.075
when, um, when Moses is, uh,

430
00:19:12.135 --> 00:19:13.555
called to the burning bush.

431
00:19:14.535 --> 00:19:19.195
And so we see that, um, he, uh, approaches with his,

432
00:19:19.935 --> 00:19:22.955
uh, chacos on, and he said, don't do that.

433
00:19:22.955 --> 00:19:23.955
You're on holy ground.

434
00:19:24.695 --> 00:19:26.515
And this is the angel of the Lord appeared

435
00:19:26.575 --> 00:19:29.075
to him in a flame out of the midst of the bush.

436
00:19:29.075 --> 00:19:30.675
And he looked and behold the bush was burning,

437
00:19:31.055 --> 00:19:32.235
yet it was not consumed.

438
00:19:33.655 --> 00:19:36.275
And, and Moses said, I'll turn aside to this great sight.

439
00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:37.275
Why is the bush not burned?

440
00:19:37.275 --> 00:19:39.835
And when the Lord saw, he turned aside, and,

441
00:19:39.895 --> 00:19:41.875
and God called to him out of the bush.

442
00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:44.835
And so we see this angel of the Lord identified as God.

443
00:19:45.175 --> 00:19:48.995
And so there's, there's many passages throughout, um,

444
00:19:49.165 --> 00:19:51.435
throughout judges, which I thought was interesting,

445
00:19:51.435 --> 00:19:52.795
where this angel of the Lord

446
00:19:52.795 --> 00:19:53.875
appears to the different people.

447
00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:57.115
And one is when, when Gideon, uh, was called,

448
00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:58.675
and it says that the angel of the Lord.

449
00:19:58.915 --> 00:20:01.675
And he calls back out to him, oh Lord God,

450
00:20:01.695 --> 00:20:02.955
he identifies him as God.

451
00:20:02.955 --> 00:20:06.115
And at the end of that passage, he says, be basically,

452
00:20:06.135 --> 00:20:08.715
be secure, be strong, because I am with you.

453
00:20:09.105 --> 00:20:12.075
It's that person, that expression of God,

454
00:20:12.075 --> 00:20:13.435
that personal expression of God.

455
00:20:14.135 --> 00:20:16.075
We see it as Samson's, uh,

456
00:20:16.075 --> 00:20:18.715
mother also has receives a similar message.

457
00:20:18.715 --> 00:20:22.555
And so we'd see these interpersonal, uh, relationships

458
00:20:22.975 --> 00:20:26.915
of God, uh, in, uh, through his

459
00:20:27.625 --> 00:20:32.235
persona with his people, um, as we move to kind of evidences

460
00:20:32.235 --> 00:20:34.635
or manifestations seeing the Holy Spirit

461
00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:35.955
in scripture in the Old Testament.

462
00:20:36.035 --> 00:20:37.395
Let's flip over to Nehemiah.

463
00:20:38.095 --> 00:20:40.755
Um, if you have a journaling Bible, it's on page 4 0 4.

464
00:20:41.415 --> 00:20:44.395
If you don't, uh, then, then you'll be able

465
00:20:44.395 --> 00:20:45.995
to find it 'cause it's right after Ezra.

466
00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:50.525
But, um, in verse in, in Nehemiah chapter nine,

467
00:20:52.355 --> 00:20:55.005
that the, the people of Israel are confessing.

468
00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.525
They're confessing all that they've done.

469
00:20:57.345 --> 00:21:00.845
And then, um, they speak

470
00:21:00.845 --> 00:21:02.605
about the spirit of the Lord.

471
00:21:02.605 --> 00:21:05.805
So if we're in, if, if you found Nehemiah nine, go

472
00:21:05.885 --> 00:21:08.885
to verse 20 and it says, you gave your good spirit

473
00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:13.125
to instruct them and did not withhold your manna from their

474
00:21:13.125 --> 00:21:16.485
mouth and gave them water for their thirst

475
00:21:17.785 --> 00:21:19.365
for 40 years, you sustain them in the

476
00:21:19.365 --> 00:21:20.445
wilderness and they lack nothing.

477
00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:21.805
Their clothes did not wear out,

478
00:21:21.825 --> 00:21:23.005
and their feet did not swell.

479
00:21:23.305 --> 00:21:27.485
And so they're, they're talking to, to God that,

480
00:21:28.075 --> 00:21:31.125
that they, his, the Holy Spirit was given,

481
00:21:31.265 --> 00:21:35.085
but also that God the Father was providing from heaven.

482
00:21:35.745 --> 00:21:38.965
And then we see in verse 30 says, many years you bore

483
00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.605
with them and warn them then through your spirit

484
00:21:42.625 --> 00:21:44.045
and then through your prophets,

485
00:21:44.065 --> 00:21:45.125
yet they would not give your,

486
00:21:45.125 --> 00:21:46.445
therefore you gave them into the hand

487
00:21:46.445 --> 00:21:47.485
of the peoples of the lands.

488
00:21:48.465 --> 00:21:50.805
And so that he's, he's warning 'em through the spirit,

489
00:21:50.955 --> 00:21:52.485
then speaking through prophets.

490
00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:55.405
So we see this spirit speaking through prophets.

491
00:21:57.095 --> 00:21:58.395
And last week in Nicaragua,

492
00:21:58.395 --> 00:22:00.595
we were just studying about when the verses we kicked off

493
00:22:00.915 --> 00:22:05.635
the week was two Peter chapter one, right, that no,

494
00:22:05.815 --> 00:22:07.115
no prophecy was brought forth

495
00:22:07.135 --> 00:22:08.475
by man, but it was carried forth.

496
00:22:08.585 --> 00:22:10.155
They were carried forth by the Holy Spirit,

497
00:22:10.545 --> 00:22:13.315
that the Holy Spirit speaks through the prophets,

498
00:22:13.315 --> 00:22:16.835
through the, he spoke through the prophets of old to, uh,

499
00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:18.275
to reveal scripture.

500
00:22:19.735 --> 00:22:22.315
And, um, and then in this passage of ne miah

501
00:22:22.335 --> 00:22:25.115
to warn the people, um, what's to come.

502
00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:26.515
So we see the, the father

503
00:22:26.615 --> 00:22:29.315
and the spirit working in conjunction, um,

504
00:22:29.415 --> 00:22:32.275
in these passages in a in a related sense.

505
00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:35.115
Let's flip over next to Isaiah. This is a lot of scripture.

506
00:22:35.165 --> 00:22:36.555
We're gonna get to questions here in a little bit,

507
00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:39.675
and I think that's gonna be, uh, super fun.

508
00:22:39.815 --> 00:22:42.155
And we're gonna fill this chair when that happens.

509
00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:46.035
But, um, let's jump into Isaiah chapter 48.

510
00:22:46.695 --> 00:22:47.515
So flip over real quick.

511
00:22:47.515 --> 00:22:48.755
I'll give you a minute to turn there.

512
00:22:48.935 --> 00:22:50.875
And this is the Lord's call to Israel.

513
00:22:51.735 --> 00:22:55.475
And so we see, we see evidence of, of the trinity,

514
00:22:55.475 --> 00:22:59.115
of different persons of God express as we read through, um,

515
00:22:59.375 --> 00:23:01.795
verses 12 through 17, but wants to stop and,

516
00:23:01.895 --> 00:23:04.435
and pause a little bit on 16, I'm gonna start in 12.

517
00:23:06.735 --> 00:23:09.275
He says, listen to me, o Jacob

518
00:23:09.535 --> 00:23:14.275
and Israel, whom I've called, I am He, I am the first

519
00:23:14.975 --> 00:23:16.035
and I'm the last.

520
00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:19.155
My hand laid the foundation of the earth

521
00:23:19.695 --> 00:23:23.035
and my right hand spread out the heavens when I call

522
00:23:23.055 --> 00:23:27.835
to them, they stand together, assemble all of you,

523
00:23:27.835 --> 00:23:30.275
and listen, who among them has declared these things?

524
00:23:31.255 --> 00:23:35.275
The Lord loves him. He shall perform his purpose on Babylon.

525
00:23:35.275 --> 00:23:37.315
His arms shall be against the Chaldeans.

526
00:23:38.515 --> 00:23:42.755
I even, I have spoken and called him and have brought him,

527
00:23:43.295 --> 00:23:44.955
and he will prosper in his way.

528
00:23:46.225 --> 00:23:49.405
Listen to 16, draw near to me.

529
00:23:50.075 --> 00:23:51.845
Hear this from the beginning.

530
00:23:52.045 --> 00:23:55.085
I have not spoken in secret from the time it came to be.

531
00:23:55.285 --> 00:23:58.125
I have been there. And now the Lord God has sent

532
00:23:58.265 --> 00:24:00.445
me and his spirit.

533
00:24:01.385 --> 00:24:04.245
So right there at the end of Isaiah 48, 16,

534
00:24:04.305 --> 00:24:06.045
we see the three persons of God.

535
00:24:06.105 --> 00:24:08.925
We see the Father sending the Son

536
00:24:09.265 --> 00:24:12.485
and sending the Spirit to proclaim the things

537
00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:14.445
that we would say have been proclaimed in secret.

538
00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:18.805
But he says that they have been spoken, um, not in secret.

539
00:24:20.745 --> 00:24:24.405
And then he says, thus says the Lord, your redeemer,

540
00:24:24.545 --> 00:24:27.005
the holy one of Israel, I'm the Lord your God,

541
00:24:27.025 --> 00:24:28.165
who teaches you to profit,

542
00:24:28.545 --> 00:24:30.125
who leads you in the way you should go.

543
00:24:31.105 --> 00:24:33.885
And so the Lord, he reveals himself for our good.

544
00:24:34.585 --> 00:24:36.765
He reveals himself in these three different ways,

545
00:24:36.765 --> 00:24:38.365
because number one, that's who he is.

546
00:24:39.745 --> 00:24:42.165
And so we, we relate to the Father

547
00:24:42.225 --> 00:24:45.445
and the Son, the Spirit, um, all one.

548
00:24:46.345 --> 00:24:49.765
But, but all, uh, we, we relate differently, uh,

549
00:24:49.765 --> 00:24:50.965
to the different persons of that.

550
00:24:50.965 --> 00:24:53.245
And it's a, it's a beautiful, it's a mystery.

551
00:24:53.245 --> 00:24:55.485
And so several people that I was talking, uh,

552
00:24:55.685 --> 00:24:57.165
I was listening to speak,

553
00:24:57.165 --> 00:24:59.405
but also reading, we're talking about the difference

554
00:24:59.405 --> 00:25:02.485
between a controversy and a mystery, right?

555
00:25:02.485 --> 00:25:06.165
And a controversy is like, we're we're upset about it.

556
00:25:06.345 --> 00:25:09.205
And there's, there's a controversy because something's right

557
00:25:09.205 --> 00:25:11.965
and something's not and, and what's right and what's not.

558
00:25:11.965 --> 00:25:14.005
And there are, there are, um, cults

559
00:25:14.005 --> 00:25:15.605
and there are false teachers and,

560
00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:18.925
and false religions that have heretical beliefs

561
00:25:19.315 --> 00:25:21.925
that would make a controversy about the Trinity.

562
00:25:22.305 --> 00:25:23.765
But really, it's a beautiful mystery.

563
00:25:23.795 --> 00:25:26.725
It's, it's, it's a, it's the, it's a magnificent way

564
00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:30.045
that God is, he is a being.

565
00:25:30.265 --> 00:25:33.125
He is he, he is one,

566
00:25:33.825 --> 00:25:36.845
and yet he is three persons in one.

567
00:25:37.065 --> 00:25:40.085
And so, um, it, it's not, it's a, it's a mystery

568
00:25:40.085 --> 00:25:42.365
because we can't fully understand the side

569
00:25:42.365 --> 00:25:44.005
of heaven how that is.

570
00:25:44.745 --> 00:25:46.845
But it's beautiful in that he's revealed

571
00:25:46.865 --> 00:25:48.605
to us what we can know.

572
00:25:48.825 --> 00:25:50.605
And, and we just can study and study and study.

573
00:25:50.665 --> 00:25:54.565
So, um, while we're still here in Isaiah,

574
00:25:54.645 --> 00:25:56.125
I wanna flip over to chapter 55.

575
00:25:56.325 --> 00:25:59.085
'cause there's another, uh, I'm sorry, chapter 45,

576
00:25:59.565 --> 00:26:01.565
I misspoke Chapter 45 in Isaiah.

577
00:26:02.065 --> 00:26:05.365
And this is a, this is one where, so in chapter 40, uh,

578
00:26:05.415 --> 00:26:08.085
eight, we saw the three persons of God,

579
00:26:08.085 --> 00:26:10.845
and then we were brought back to this unity, uh,

580
00:26:11.505 --> 00:26:14.005
or in, in Isaiah 45.

581
00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:18.405
And this is, uh, this is actually a verse that, um,

582
00:26:20.555 --> 00:26:24.985
that some controversy, promoters

583
00:26:25.925 --> 00:26:30.385
or, uh, Trinity opposers would, um, would bring up.

584
00:26:30.385 --> 00:26:33.185
And so verses five through seven, it says,

585
00:26:33.255 --> 00:26:36.145
someone would say in scripture, it says, I'm the Lord

586
00:26:36.145 --> 00:26:38.425
and there is no other besides me.

587
00:26:38.425 --> 00:26:41.785
There is no God. I equip you though you do not know me,

588
00:26:41.785 --> 00:26:42.825
that people may know.

589
00:26:43.505 --> 00:26:45.525
And from the rising of the sun from the west,

590
00:26:45.595 --> 00:26:47.845
that there is none besides me.

591
00:26:49.025 --> 00:26:50.565
I'm the Lord, and there is no other.

592
00:26:51.845 --> 00:26:53.525
I form light and create darkness.

593
00:26:53.685 --> 00:26:55.445
I make wellbeing and create calamity.

594
00:26:55.525 --> 00:26:57.445
I am the Lord who does all these things.

595
00:26:57.945 --> 00:26:59.765
And so they would say, it says right there in your Bible,

596
00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:04.485
in your scripture, that besides me, there is no other God.

597
00:27:05.025 --> 00:27:08.365
I'm the Lord, and there is no other. And we would say, amen.

598
00:27:09.025 --> 00:27:12.805
That's right. He is the God. He is one. There is no other.

599
00:27:12.815 --> 00:27:15.205
There is no other God who is one in essence

600
00:27:15.205 --> 00:27:16.365
and three in person, right?

601
00:27:16.375 --> 00:27:21.325
There is no other God who is one that we can trust, that,

602
00:27:21.395 --> 00:27:23.845
that loves us, has poured himself out for us.

603
00:27:24.585 --> 00:27:28.925
And so, um, to say God is one, yes, amen. That is true.

604
00:27:29.865 --> 00:27:32.925
But it, but then we unpack that to understand the Trinity.

605
00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:37.965
Um, one other thing we've got in Old Testament scriptures

606
00:27:37.965 --> 00:27:40.205
of the use of plural pronouns.

607
00:27:40.945 --> 00:27:44.965
And so, um, there are, there are scriptures, Genesis 1 26,

608
00:27:44.965 --> 00:27:47.845
where he says, let us make man in our own image,

609
00:27:48.045 --> 00:27:49.085
I mean in our likeness.

610
00:27:49.985 --> 00:27:53.325
And so, so we see that God as he's expressing, as we're

611
00:27:53.325 --> 00:27:55.925
to let us make man in our image

612
00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:58.805
after our likeness, so that we would be made in the image

613
00:27:58.805 --> 00:28:03.245
of our triune God at the time of the fall, we see God say,

614
00:28:03.625 --> 00:28:07.325
behold man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil.

615
00:28:08.225 --> 00:28:10.685
And then later in Genesis 11, at the Tower of Babel,

616
00:28:11.345 --> 00:28:14.045
God says, let us go down there

617
00:28:14.305 --> 00:28:16.725
and confuse their language, father, son

618
00:28:16.725 --> 00:28:19.565
and spirit to earth to do that.

619
00:28:20.985 --> 00:28:22.765
And then in, in one passage that we,

620
00:28:22.765 --> 00:28:24.645
that we celebrate in Isaiah chapter six,

621
00:28:25.015 --> 00:28:26.205
where Isaiah's in the temple

622
00:28:26.225 --> 00:28:29.605
and he sees the glory of the, of the majesty of God,

623
00:28:29.715 --> 00:28:31.445
fill, fill that space.

624
00:28:32.185 --> 00:28:34.685
And then the Lord says, whom shall I send?

625
00:28:35.885 --> 00:28:36.905
Who will go for us?

626
00:28:37.725 --> 00:28:40.145
So even in that passage, you see the singular

627
00:28:40.745 --> 00:28:43.705
personal pronoun, I, whom shall I send?

628
00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:45.625
And in the very second half of

629
00:28:45.625 --> 00:28:47.145
that sentence, who will go for us?

630
00:28:47.925 --> 00:28:51.105
And so God's given us these glimpses. It's not a secret.

631
00:28:51.885 --> 00:28:54.425
Um, it's just reliant upon us to,

632
00:28:54.485 --> 00:28:56.025
to unpack and then to trust.

633
00:28:57.725 --> 00:29:00.745
We see, uh, other Messianic references throughout Psalms.

634
00:29:00.745 --> 00:29:04.185
One of the famous ones is in, uh, Psalms 110.

635
00:29:05.205 --> 00:29:08.905
And in, um, Psalms 110 verse one,

636
00:29:09.645 --> 00:29:12.465
we see this interpersonal relationship play out

637
00:29:12.465 --> 00:29:16.505
where he says, the Lord says, to my Lord,

638
00:29:16.845 --> 00:29:17.865
sit at my right hand

639
00:29:17.915 --> 00:29:20.225
until I make your enemies your footstool.

640
00:29:21.985 --> 00:29:24.685
The Lord sends forth from Zion your mighty scepter

641
00:29:25.515 --> 00:29:26.885
rule in the midst of your enemies.

642
00:29:27.145 --> 00:29:31.125
And that scepter that he references there is,

643
00:29:31.185 --> 00:29:35.885
is a reference back to, um, it's a reference back

644
00:29:35.885 --> 00:29:39.845
to Genesis chapter 49, when Jacob's laying out the blessing

645
00:29:39.845 --> 00:29:42.965
and the promises for all of his sons, right?

646
00:29:43.145 --> 00:29:44.485
He goes one by one.

647
00:29:44.485 --> 00:29:48.085
And when he lands on Judah, he talks about the lion,

648
00:29:48.785 --> 00:29:50.925
but he also talks, the scepter talks about

649
00:29:50.925 --> 00:29:52.165
the scepter going up from Judah.

650
00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:55.605
So when you see the word scepter, again, this is a, an old

651
00:29:56.285 --> 00:30:01.085
biblical theology, HTI lesson from, uh, professor Ferguson,

652
00:30:01.715 --> 00:30:05.045
that when you see that scepter come out, that's Christ.

653
00:30:05.185 --> 00:30:06.925
That's the promise of our redeemer.

654
00:30:06.925 --> 00:30:09.205
That's the promise of the king coming through.

655
00:30:09.205 --> 00:30:10.885
We see it come out at different places in scripture,

656
00:30:10.945 --> 00:30:13.645
but it started, it has its root in Genesis 49.

657
00:30:13.705 --> 00:30:17.645
So in Psalm one 10, then we see the Lord

658
00:30:19.265 --> 00:30:24.085
Father on the throne says to my Lord the king, the son

659
00:30:24.085 --> 00:30:26.205
of David, the son of man, Jesus Christ,

660
00:30:26.345 --> 00:30:29.405
to sit at my right hand.

661
00:30:29.625 --> 00:30:31.765
So we see the Father and the Son together.

662
00:30:33.325 --> 00:30:36.025
We also see in Psalm chapter 45,

663
00:30:38.365 --> 00:30:42.345
if we flip over there, this is a whole psalm

664
00:30:42.345 --> 00:30:44.305
that has sung to the king.

665
00:30:45.405 --> 00:30:46.425
And in verses six

666
00:30:46.445 --> 00:30:48.305
and seven, we see the words,

667
00:30:48.305 --> 00:30:50.545
your throne over God is forever and ever.

668
00:30:50.685 --> 00:30:54.665
The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of, of uprightness.

669
00:30:55.085 --> 00:30:59.105
You have loved righteousness and you have hated wickedness.

670
00:31:00.445 --> 00:31:01.545
And so it says,

671
00:31:01.545 --> 00:31:05.345
therefore, your God has anointed you with the oil

672
00:31:05.345 --> 00:31:07.225
of gladness beyond your companions.

673
00:31:07.225 --> 00:31:10.545
And so he's saying that you are you Christ, you Jesus,

674
00:31:10.685 --> 00:31:11.745
you the Son, are on the throne,

675
00:31:11.745 --> 00:31:13.465
and your God has anointed you.

676
00:31:14.165 --> 00:31:16.825
And so that God the Father, so there's this, he's the,

677
00:31:17.045 --> 00:31:19.545
the psalmist is unpacking this in Psalm,

678
00:31:19.775 --> 00:31:22.865
this beautiful relationship between the Father and the Son.

679
00:31:23.765 --> 00:31:28.025
And then in Isaiah chapter 61, this is the last of the kind

680
00:31:28.025 --> 00:31:31.545
of plural pronoun, uh, I'm sorry, the last

681
00:31:31.545 --> 00:31:33.505
of the Messianic reference passages.

682
00:31:33.555 --> 00:31:34.625
There are many more,

683
00:31:34.685 --> 00:31:37.825
but this is the last one we'll study tonight in chapter, uh,

684
00:31:38.075 --> 00:31:41.545
61 of Isaiah, verse 61, we see the spirit

685
00:31:43.465 --> 00:31:45.965
and he says, the spirit of the Lord God is upon me

686
00:31:46.395 --> 00:31:48.365
because the Lord has anointed me

687
00:31:48.705 --> 00:31:50.245
to bring good news to the poor.

688
00:31:50.545 --> 00:31:54.005
And he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted,

689
00:31:54.385 --> 00:31:57.085
to proclaim liberty to the captives, the opening

690
00:31:57.105 --> 00:31:59.525
of the prison, to those who are bound to proclaim the year

691
00:31:59.525 --> 00:32:00.645
of the Lord's favor,

692
00:32:01.265 --> 00:32:04.525
and the day of vengeance from our God to comfort all

693
00:32:04.545 --> 00:32:07.005
who mourn, to grant to those who mourn in Zion,

694
00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:09.125
to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, oil

695
00:32:09.125 --> 00:32:10.765
of gladness instead of mourning.

696
00:32:12.665 --> 00:32:15.805
And so we see that this is a, this is a, a passage

697
00:32:15.805 --> 00:32:17.885
where Isaiah's prophesying of the coming Christ

698
00:32:17.905 --> 00:32:19.165
and all the things that we will,

699
00:32:19.195 --> 00:32:20.805
that we'll do, that he will do.

700
00:32:22.385 --> 00:32:24.405
And it says, the spirit of the Lord came

701
00:32:24.435 --> 00:32:25.605
upon me to tell me this.

702
00:32:25.625 --> 00:32:27.165
And so we see father sin

703
00:32:27.165 --> 00:32:30.885
and spirit again at work in Isaiah chapter 61,

704
00:32:31.945 --> 00:32:35.385
um, there's two other pa Old Testament passages I wanna

705
00:32:35.385 --> 00:32:36.865
finish with, and then we'll, we'll jump ahead.

706
00:32:36.885 --> 00:32:41.405
But in, uh, in back in Isaiah chapter six again, it, it,

707
00:32:41.425 --> 00:32:44.765
we we're back in that, in that, uh, situation in the temple.

708
00:32:45.585 --> 00:32:47.285
And, um, and you remember the praise,

709
00:32:47.385 --> 00:32:49.165
it was holy, holy, holy.

710
00:32:49.625 --> 00:32:50.965
And we see that represented three times.

711
00:32:50.985 --> 00:32:52.285
So there's a sense of threes.

712
00:32:52.285 --> 00:32:54.765
There's that holiness that said three times, holy, holy,

713
00:32:54.795 --> 00:32:56.725
holy is the Lord God Almighty.

714
00:32:56.725 --> 00:32:59.525
And that's true, because God, the Father is holy

715
00:32:59.525 --> 00:33:02.245
and God, the Son is holy, and God, the Spirit is holy.

716
00:33:02.705 --> 00:33:06.005
And as you read and study through that, um, um,

717
00:33:07.005 --> 00:33:09.885
antonian creed, you see that that reference,

718
00:33:09.885 --> 00:33:11.605
that refrain play out the other part.

719
00:33:11.605 --> 00:33:14.085
The other verse I came across I thought was really neat was

720
00:33:14.085 --> 00:33:16.325
one that I love, it's numbers chapter six,

721
00:33:16.385 --> 00:33:18.045
verses 24 through 26.

722
00:33:19.825 --> 00:33:22.885
And, and it's this, um, it's this blessing.

723
00:33:22.915 --> 00:33:26.245
It's kind of this, um, this send out, right?

724
00:33:26.305 --> 00:33:29.645
The, the, that the Lord would bless you and keep you.

725
00:33:29.985 --> 00:33:32.485
The Lord was make his face to shine upon you, the Lord.

726
00:33:33.145 --> 00:33:34.885
Um, let me read it.

727
00:33:34.905 --> 00:33:36.205
I'm trying to recite it while I'm getting there.

728
00:33:36.225 --> 00:33:37.525
I'm gonna mess up turning pages.

729
00:33:37.705 --> 00:33:40.805
But it would say, the Lord bless you

730
00:33:40.805 --> 00:33:43.645
and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you

731
00:33:43.665 --> 00:33:44.805
and be gracious to you.

732
00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:48.285
The Lord defend his countenance upon you and give you peace.

733
00:33:48.905 --> 00:33:51.925
And so we see the Lord referenced three times in that,

734
00:33:51.945 --> 00:33:55.565
and that the Lord is, is revealing himself in, in three kind

735
00:33:55.565 --> 00:33:57.845
of little bit different ways, that the Lord would bless you,

736
00:33:58.105 --> 00:34:00.045
the Lord would make his face to shine upon you,

737
00:34:00.045 --> 00:34:01.605
and then the Lord would give his countenance,

738
00:34:01.605 --> 00:34:03.925
which is his face again, that he's poured out to us.

739
00:34:03.945 --> 00:34:06.085
But that would bring us peace, that the,

740
00:34:06.085 --> 00:34:08.285
maybe the graciousness of Christ comes through that,

741
00:34:08.585 --> 00:34:09.805
and then through the Spirit,

742
00:34:09.985 --> 00:34:11.605
his countenance would give us peace.

743
00:34:12.185 --> 00:34:15.005
And so we see that, that the Trinity even expressed in

744
00:34:15.005 --> 00:34:17.405
that blessing in the book of numbers.

745
00:34:18.665 --> 00:34:21.285
Um, so many people try to pull out, uh,

746
00:34:21.365 --> 00:34:22.925
passages from the Old Testament

747
00:34:23.145 --> 00:34:25.765
and say, no, it's, it's, it's, it's only one.

748
00:34:25.765 --> 00:34:28.125
It's not three. And so just as we answer

749
00:34:28.265 --> 00:34:30.965
to Isaiah chapter 48, we can also answer

750
00:34:30.965 --> 00:34:32.525
to Isaiah chapter 44

751
00:34:33.105 --> 00:34:36.045
and 46, that there is no other God.

752
00:34:36.045 --> 00:34:38.445
That's what that's proclaiming into that we would say yes.

753
00:34:39.305 --> 00:34:43.685
Um, so as I was studying

754
00:34:43.705 --> 00:34:45.765
and looking back through the, the different New Testament

755
00:34:45.765 --> 00:34:50.405
passages that, that John shared, and in one Corinthians 12

756
00:34:50.945 --> 00:34:53.365
and Galatians, that, that we trust the way

757
00:34:53.365 --> 00:34:55.325
that God has revealed himself, that he has

758
00:34:55.925 --> 00:34:57.325
revealed himself perfectly.

759
00:34:57.945 --> 00:35:02.805
Um, we see in, in John chapter five verse 30, this,

760
00:35:02.945 --> 00:35:07.205
um, passage where that Christ came to do, he says, the will

761
00:35:07.205 --> 00:35:08.285
of the one who sent me,

762
00:35:08.285 --> 00:35:10.205
and he, I came not on my own authority,

763
00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:12.285
but on the authority of the one who sent me.

764
00:35:12.285 --> 00:35:14.605
And, and many people will, will, will use that passage

765
00:35:14.785 --> 00:35:16.445
to say that then Jesus isn't God

766
00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:18.325
or he's, he's someone not equal with God.

767
00:35:18.705 --> 00:35:21.125
And, and really what he's displaying is the Philippians

768
00:35:21.125 --> 00:35:22.765
chapter two, humility of Christ.

769
00:35:23.135 --> 00:35:25.445
Jesus is displaying whose humility in that moment

770
00:35:25.675 --> 00:35:27.485
because we know from Philippians that,

771
00:35:27.715 --> 00:35:30.365
that he was created perfectly in God image.

772
00:35:30.365 --> 00:35:33.165
And in Colossians, we see that he's the perfect, uh, imprint

773
00:35:33.165 --> 00:35:36.885
of his likeness, but that he did, he, he, he made himself,

774
00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:39.765
he humbled himself, um, taking on the flesh

775
00:35:39.825 --> 00:35:41.005
to come to this earth.

776
00:35:41.945 --> 00:35:45.405
And so, um, as we walked through all these passages,

777
00:35:45.505 --> 00:35:47.245
we would just say that the,

778
00:35:47.305 --> 00:35:50.885
the Trinity is not something concocted by, um,

779
00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:55.405
by the Roman Catholic Church

780
00:35:56.595 --> 00:36:00.095
or by, um, people after the fact.

781
00:36:00.205 --> 00:36:01.655
It's, it's all over scripture.

782
00:36:01.685 --> 00:36:02.735
It's all throughout scripture.

783
00:36:02.765 --> 00:36:05.615
From Genesis all the way to Revelation, we see the Father

784
00:36:05.675 --> 00:36:08.295
and the Son and the Spirit all interacting together.

785
00:36:08.315 --> 00:36:12.055
We even see that in, um, in the first two chapters

786
00:36:12.055 --> 00:36:15.215
of Revelation, uh, revelation six, where there's the glory

787
00:36:15.215 --> 00:36:16.695
and the worship around the throne,

788
00:36:16.795 --> 00:36:19.415
and we see, uh, the image of the Father on the throne.

789
00:36:19.475 --> 00:36:20.615
We see the image of the Son

790
00:36:20.615 --> 00:36:24.415
and the image of the Spirit as, uh, as flames surrounding

791
00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:26.855
that all giving glory, uh, in that place.

792
00:36:26.855 --> 00:36:28.455
So we see it from Genesis to Revelation.

793
00:36:28.475 --> 00:36:33.455
And so, um, the pillars that we would walk away from, um,

794
00:36:33.865 --> 00:36:36.855
would be that yes, uh, we are monotheists.

795
00:36:37.075 --> 00:36:40.295
We believe in one God, we believe in one God, um,

796
00:36:40.795 --> 00:36:43.415
the creator of heaven and earth, and that there is no God

797
00:36:43.415 --> 00:36:45.175
before him, and there's no God like him,

798
00:36:45.175 --> 00:36:46.535
and there will be no God after him.

799
00:36:46.915 --> 00:36:49.255
We believe in the God of Deuteronomy six.

800
00:36:49.915 --> 00:36:52.535
And um, and we love him and we adore him.

801
00:36:53.075 --> 00:36:56.935
Uh, we believe in the one God of Isaiah chapter 44 and 45,

802
00:36:57.035 --> 00:37:00.055
and that we would, um, turn to him

803
00:37:00.075 --> 00:37:01.575
and be saved like it says there.

804
00:37:01.835 --> 00:37:05.655
And we, we believe that our God is three in one. Okay?

805
00:37:05.995 --> 00:37:07.455
And so I was, I was writing that out.

806
00:37:07.535 --> 00:37:08.775
I think we talked some about that.

807
00:37:08.805 --> 00:37:11.895
He's not like the, the different analogies on Sunday.

808
00:37:12.005 --> 00:37:13.975
It's not three different parts that all come together.

809
00:37:13.995 --> 00:37:15.335
She can't take one part out.

810
00:37:15.835 --> 00:37:19.215
And so in East Texas, instead of saying three in one,

811
00:37:19.215 --> 00:37:20.335
we would say three in one.

812
00:37:20.835 --> 00:37:22.375
You know, it's like with just the

813
00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:23.655
letter n with a little apostrophe.

814
00:37:23.655 --> 00:37:24.695
And so maybe that's how we think about,

815
00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:25.735
it's like three in one.

816
00:37:26.555 --> 00:37:30.295
Um, and so these, he's not three gods, but he's one God.

817
00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:33.815
And, and really, um, we, we talked,

818
00:37:33.815 --> 00:37:35.855
we studied about the Trinity several months ago,

819
00:37:35.875 --> 00:37:37.015
not the Trinity, the Holy Spirit

820
00:37:37.075 --> 00:37:39.695
and Pentecost, um, back last spring.

821
00:37:40.155 --> 00:37:42.295
And we talked about who is the Holy Spirit.

822
00:37:42.715 --> 00:37:45.215
And so we, we would think about the who of the persons,

823
00:37:45.595 --> 00:37:47.455
and then the what of the essence.

824
00:37:47.515 --> 00:37:50.415
So we would say that we have one what?

825
00:37:50.755 --> 00:37:52.935
And that one, what is God?

826
00:37:53.755 --> 00:37:57.415
Uh, in three person who are three, we have three who's so

827
00:37:57.415 --> 00:37:59.415
to speak, um,

828
00:38:00.165 --> 00:38:03.175
talk about the Father manifest in the Holy Spirit in, um,

829
00:38:03.545 --> 00:38:06.295
first Peter chapter one, verse two.

830
00:38:06.395 --> 00:38:09.375
He talks about God the Father very clearly on display.

831
00:38:10.035 --> 00:38:12.175
And then, um, in Matthew chapter three,

832
00:38:13.115 --> 00:38:14.215
we see this interaction.

833
00:38:14.215 --> 00:38:15.975
This is, um, I think, uh,

834
00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:19.335
John referenced Mark chapter one in Matthew chapter three,

835
00:38:19.335 --> 00:38:22.095
we see the same, uh, the same story play out

836
00:38:22.095 --> 00:38:23.335
of Jesus' baptism.

837
00:38:23.715 --> 00:38:26.895
So we, it's, we see the, the Holy Spirit, the Trinity,

838
00:38:27.395 --> 00:38:30.535
the Father and the, and the Son all come together

839
00:38:31.155 --> 00:38:32.815
at Jesus's baptism.

840
00:38:32.875 --> 00:38:36.180
So let's read a couple verses from that so we can kind of

841
00:38:37.025 --> 00:38:39.645
see all that, um, together and just be reminded.

842
00:38:39.785 --> 00:38:44.565
It says, um, in Matthew chapter three, see,

843
00:38:44.565 --> 00:38:46.205
most people have to put on glasses when they read.

844
00:38:46.205 --> 00:38:48.845
I have to take mine off. It's a different type of,

845
00:38:49.065 --> 00:38:51.455
um, aging.

846
00:38:53.955 --> 00:38:56.575
It says. And when Jesus was baptized,

847
00:38:57.275 --> 00:38:59.175
he immediately went up from the water,

848
00:38:59.915 --> 00:39:01.975
and behold the heavens were open to him,

849
00:39:03.035 --> 00:39:06.415
and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove

850
00:39:06.795 --> 00:39:08.175
and coming to rest on him.

851
00:39:09.155 --> 00:39:13.015
And he's the son. And behold, there was a voice from heaven

852
00:39:13.015 --> 00:39:16.655
that said, this is my beloved son, with whom I'm well

853
00:39:17.485 --> 00:39:20.975
pleased, that God the father, blessed

854
00:39:22.555 --> 00:39:25.415
God, the Father identified the Son

855
00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:28.575
and sent his spirit as a, as a physical expression

856
00:39:28.575 --> 00:39:31.655
that this descending on him while like a dove.

857
00:39:31.715 --> 00:39:36.515
In that moment, we see Jesus is God.

858
00:39:36.615 --> 00:39:37.635
We see that played out.

859
00:39:37.635 --> 00:39:41.555
We've, we spent months studying the book of Colossians,

860
00:39:42.095 --> 00:39:46.075
and we remember from Colossians chapter two verses eight

861
00:39:46.075 --> 00:39:47.475
and nine, lemme get over there real quick.

862
00:39:48.365 --> 00:39:50.715
Colossians chapter two verses eight and nine.

863
00:39:53.065 --> 00:39:55.685
It says, see to it that no one takes you captive

864
00:39:56.225 --> 00:39:59.485
by philosophy and empty deceit according to human tradition,

865
00:39:59.715 --> 00:40:01.965
according to the elemental spirits of this world,

866
00:40:02.145 --> 00:40:03.365
not according to Christ.

867
00:40:05.275 --> 00:40:08.935
For in him the fullness of deity dwells bodily.

868
00:40:09.035 --> 00:40:13.415
Now, if there's not a more clear expression of Jesus being,

869
00:40:13.475 --> 00:40:15.815
God, I I, if there's one more I'd love to see it,

870
00:40:15.815 --> 00:40:17.735
but it says, forend him, the fullness

871
00:40:17.735 --> 00:40:19.415
of deity dwells bodily,

872
00:40:19.675 --> 00:40:21.695
and you have been filled in him who is the head

873
00:40:21.695 --> 00:40:26.495
and the rule of all authority, that he is truly God,

874
00:40:27.155 --> 00:40:29.615
and he was truly man in the flesh.

875
00:40:31.155 --> 00:40:36.135
And Titus, uh, we see the good glory of our great God

876
00:40:36.135 --> 00:40:37.255
and Savior Jesus Christ.

877
00:40:37.275 --> 00:40:40.535
And there's actually, um, there's a, there's a, a,

878
00:40:40.615 --> 00:40:42.535
I think it's a Greek rule that comes out of this,

879
00:40:43.155 --> 00:40:45.055
and it's called the Grandville sharps rule.

880
00:40:45.055 --> 00:40:46.575
And this is what I learned while I was sitting in the

881
00:40:46.575 --> 00:40:48.815
airport on Sunday, Monday, couldn't get home,

882
00:40:49.165 --> 00:40:51.175
that the Grandville Sharps rule talks about

883
00:40:51.175 --> 00:40:55.215
that if there are two nouns that are connected, um,

884
00:40:55.395 --> 00:40:58.175
and then, then there's like one adjective then that applies

885
00:40:58.235 --> 00:40:59.375
to both of those things.

886
00:40:59.835 --> 00:41:03.735
It re it re applies to the, the, the same.

887
00:41:04.035 --> 00:41:08.615
So when he says in Titus chapter two, verse 13, uh,

888
00:41:08.615 --> 00:41:10.375
this is a Greek lesson, right?

889
00:41:10.375 --> 00:41:13.375
He says, we're waiting, Titus says that we are waiting

890
00:41:13.595 --> 00:41:16.135
for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory

891
00:41:16.135 --> 00:41:18.415
of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.

892
00:41:19.355 --> 00:41:22.135
So he's not saying, we're waiting for the appearing

893
00:41:22.255 --> 00:41:27.175
of our great God, stop and savior Jesus Christ.

894
00:41:27.725 --> 00:41:30.015
He's not saying that you, you can't split it up.

895
00:41:30.015 --> 00:41:34.125
But what he's saying is, we're waiting for the glory

896
00:41:34.145 --> 00:41:37.685
of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.

897
00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:40.485
And so that it applies that God

898
00:41:40.485 --> 00:41:42.885
and Savior apply to Jesus Christ.

899
00:41:43.625 --> 00:41:47.205
And, and that those all are connected in that, in that rule.

900
00:41:47.825 --> 00:41:51.325
And, um, and so when those two are connected,

901
00:41:51.325 --> 00:41:52.445
it applies to both.

902
00:41:52.745 --> 00:41:56.405
In second Peter chapter one, Peter talks to us, um,

903
00:41:57.975 --> 00:42:00.725
about Jesus, our God and Savior.

904
00:42:00.945 --> 00:42:04.765
And so we see that same rule, um, kind of apply that,

905
00:42:04.765 --> 00:42:07.045
those two things in chapter two,

906
00:42:07.045 --> 00:42:10.195
verse one, I'm sorry.

907
00:42:11.335 --> 00:42:15.155
Um, in second Peter, chapter one verse one, he says, Peter,

908
00:42:15.595 --> 00:42:17.475
a servant apostle of Jesus Christ are those

909
00:42:17.475 --> 00:42:20.315
who obtained faith of equal standing with ours

910
00:42:20.315 --> 00:42:24.195
by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.

911
00:42:24.195 --> 00:42:28.595
So Jesus is both God and Savior. He's proclaiming it again.

912
00:42:29.335 --> 00:42:32.285
Um, in John chapter eight, we see

913
00:42:32.595 --> 00:42:37.005
that Jesus says about himself, before Abraham was, I am.

914
00:42:37.465 --> 00:42:40.125
And he talks about before incarnate time, he was.

915
00:42:40.745 --> 00:42:42.765
And so we see that in Revelations 22.

916
00:42:43.175 --> 00:42:45.445
Again, him declaring himself as the alpha

917
00:42:45.445 --> 00:42:46.725
and the mega, the beginning and the end.

918
00:42:47.745 --> 00:42:51.685
And um, and then John chapter one is, is a passage that,

919
00:42:51.685 --> 00:42:55.685
that stands on its own as the Trinity is revealed,

920
00:42:56.075 --> 00:42:57.445
that the word became flesh.

921
00:42:57.505 --> 00:43:00.285
And clearly we know that to be Christ and dwelt among us,

922
00:43:00.585 --> 00:43:03.485
and that he was with God and he was God.

923
00:43:03.505 --> 00:43:04.885
And so we see that relationship

924
00:43:05.385 --> 00:43:08.245
and it's beautiful then that we see the next step from that.

925
00:43:08.265 --> 00:43:11.845
In, in John's next writing, his first John, first John,

926
00:43:11.845 --> 00:43:13.405
chapter four, we says, God is love.

927
00:43:13.585 --> 00:43:16.805
So we can apply that back in the middle of, of,

928
00:43:17.025 --> 00:43:18.645
um, John chapter one.

929
00:43:19.385 --> 00:43:22.205
Um, so many passages talk about the Holy Spirit.

930
00:43:22.385 --> 00:43:23.805
Uh, I wanna get to some questions.

931
00:43:24.185 --> 00:43:28.525
The Holy Spirit, if is, is a who, right? He's a person.

932
00:43:28.985 --> 00:43:33.125
Uh, we see in, uh, acts chapter five that he can be lied to.

933
00:43:33.545 --> 00:43:34.725
And it's also in that passage

934
00:43:34.755 --> 00:43:36.925
that we see the deity of the Holy Spirit.

935
00:43:36.925 --> 00:43:38.765
It says, you, you lied to the Holy Spirit

936
00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:40.085
and you lied to God.

937
00:43:40.215 --> 00:43:41.805
Those were the two accusations made.

938
00:43:41.805 --> 00:43:44.045
And so those, they're, they're linked together.

939
00:43:44.665 --> 00:43:47.885
Um, we see the Holy Spirit speaking in Acts chapter 13.

940
00:43:47.905 --> 00:43:50.445
And in chapter 10, um,

941
00:43:50.625 --> 00:43:52.925
we read in Ephesians chapter four verse 30,

942
00:43:52.925 --> 00:43:54.965
that we can grieve the Holy Spirit in Hebrews

943
00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:56.245
that we can insult the Holy Spirit.

944
00:43:57.025 --> 00:44:01.325
And then, um, we're, we are called to, um,

945
00:44:03.015 --> 00:44:06.775
baptized in Matthew 28, in the name of Father, son,

946
00:44:06.775 --> 00:44:07.855
and Holy Spirit, right?

947
00:44:07.995 --> 00:44:10.375
It doesn't say the names, but the name of each one.

948
00:44:10.875 --> 00:44:13.135
And so that's, uh, we see those all throughout,

949
00:44:13.515 --> 00:44:14.535
uh, the New Testament.

950
00:44:15.595 --> 00:44:18.195
Um, how are we doing on time?

951
00:44:18.995 --> 00:44:20.235
I wanna leave some time for questions.

952
00:44:20.655 --> 00:44:23.355
So these are seven questions that have been commonly asked,

953
00:44:23.355 --> 00:44:24.395
and I'll go through these pretty quickly

954
00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:25.715
and then we'll open up for your questions.

955
00:44:26.375 --> 00:44:29.475
The first is, why isn't the word trinity found in the Bible?

956
00:44:29.865 --> 00:44:32.325
Okay, so why isn't it the word trinity found in the Bible?

957
00:44:32.475 --> 00:44:34.325
Well, God didn't ordained

958
00:44:34.325 --> 00:44:35.525
to put the word trinity in the Bible,

959
00:44:35.545 --> 00:44:37.805
so it's not in the Bible, but is

960
00:44:37.805 --> 00:44:39.205
that a reason to not believe in it?

961
00:44:39.265 --> 00:44:42.125
And we would say no, because we see evidence of the Father,

962
00:44:42.145 --> 00:44:44.005
son, and spirit working together just as we've studied.

963
00:44:44.545 --> 00:44:47.005
We would also say that we don't see the word omniscient

964
00:44:47.365 --> 00:44:48.725
anywhere in scripture, right?

965
00:44:49.425 --> 00:44:52.205
But we believe in the omniscience of God, right?

966
00:44:52.225 --> 00:44:54.365
We don't see the word omnipresent anywhere in scripture,

967
00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:56.805
but we believe in the omnipresence of God.

968
00:44:57.185 --> 00:44:59.085
And so there are things about God

969
00:44:59.085 --> 00:45:01.925
that the word doesn't exist, but scripture speaks to it.

970
00:45:02.865 --> 00:45:06.365
Second question, how can Jesus be God if he said in John

971
00:45:06.365 --> 00:45:11.225
chapter 17, the God and Father is the only true God.

972
00:45:11.965 --> 00:45:14.465
So Jesus said, chapter John chapter 17, verse three,

973
00:45:14.925 --> 00:45:16.705
the God the Father is the only true God.

974
00:45:17.805 --> 00:45:21.025
And we would say yes, and Jesus is God.

975
00:45:21.405 --> 00:45:22.945
And yes, the Spirit is God.

976
00:45:23.405 --> 00:45:26.225
And in John chapter one, it says, the word was God,

977
00:45:26.225 --> 00:45:28.905
and the word was with, I'm sorry, the word was God.

978
00:45:29.405 --> 00:45:31.185
And the word was with God

979
00:45:31.455 --> 00:45:33.985
that those two are in the same verse, right?

980
00:45:34.805 --> 00:45:36.945
So that's, that's an answer, kind of that question.

981
00:45:37.605 --> 00:45:39.425
Uh, one other question that, the third question

982
00:45:39.425 --> 00:45:42.905
that some people, times people ask is in John chapter 14,

983
00:45:42.955 --> 00:45:47.225
verse 28, where Jesus says, my Father is greater than I.

984
00:45:48.085 --> 00:45:50.705
And so we've addressed that a little bit, where, um,

985
00:45:51.375 --> 00:45:54.265
it's kind of like, it's the sense in which Jesus is saying

986
00:45:54.265 --> 00:45:56.545
that He's saying that in the person, in the place

987
00:45:56.545 --> 00:46:00.265
that he is, that yes God the Father is greater God the

988
00:46:00.265 --> 00:46:04.225
Father, um, is greater in person, uh, at that time

989
00:46:04.295 --> 00:46:08.745
because he, um, he has humbled Christ has humbled himself,

990
00:46:08.745 --> 00:46:13.345
taking on the form of a servant relative to the will of

991
00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:17.345
our triune God in saving humanity.

992
00:46:17.565 --> 00:46:20.385
And so he took on that mantle, he took on flesh and that,

993
00:46:20.485 --> 00:46:22.225
and that God, the Father, is greater than me

994
00:46:22.385 --> 00:46:23.945
because God the Father sent me.

995
00:46:24.685 --> 00:46:26.265
Um, and so we see

996
00:46:26.265 --> 00:46:28.625
that unpacked in Philippians two, like we talked about.

997
00:46:29.685 --> 00:46:32.065
Um, the fourth question was, well,

998
00:46:32.065 --> 00:46:34.065
if Jesus is God, who is he praying to?

999
00:46:34.165 --> 00:46:35.305
Can God pray to God?

1000
00:46:36.165 --> 00:46:39.345
And, um, and we would say that yes,

1001
00:46:39.895 --> 00:46:42.745
because they interrelate and we see that interrelation

1002
00:46:42.805 --> 00:46:45.265
before the world began, that that, that,

1003
00:46:45.535 --> 00:46:47.305
that is a problem, right?

1004
00:46:47.365 --> 00:46:49.625
If you believe in modalism, so that,

1005
00:46:50.095 --> 00:46:52.225
that if you believe in modalism, which is where there,

1006
00:46:52.225 --> 00:46:55.385
that God can only exist as the Father or the Son

1007
00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:57.545
or the Spirit, then that is a problem.

1008
00:46:57.865 --> 00:47:01.225
'cause then you get this situation where Jesus is speaking,

1009
00:47:01.895 --> 00:47:03.385
Lord speak, father speaks back,

1010
00:47:03.435 --> 00:47:04.825
Jesus speaking, and he switches.

1011
00:47:04.885 --> 00:47:06.665
And, and that's not the way it works out, right?

1012
00:47:06.665 --> 00:47:08.905
It's this, it's this inner relationship that we know existed

1013
00:47:08.905 --> 00:47:10.105
before the world began.

1014
00:47:11.725 --> 00:47:13.465
So the fifth question is, how can ge

1015
00:47:13.525 --> 00:47:15.585
or sixth question is, um, what about,

1016
00:47:15.725 --> 00:47:18.625
and people will say in, um, Colossians chapter one,

1017
00:47:18.625 --> 00:47:21.425
verse 15, that Jesus was created, um,

1018
00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:23.985
and this is one of the, one of the heresies where there's a,

1019
00:47:24.065 --> 00:47:25.385
a manipulation of scripture

1020
00:47:26.445 --> 00:47:28.985
and that he's God in human form,

1021
00:47:29.045 --> 00:47:31.285
it says He's the firstborn of all creation.

1022
00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:34.365
Well, that word firstborn can, it,

1023
00:47:34.465 --> 00:47:36.365
it oftentimes means a preeminence.

1024
00:47:36.745 --> 00:47:39.285
It identifies not necessarily a, a birth order

1025
00:47:39.385 --> 00:47:40.445
so much as a preeminence.

1026
00:47:40.445 --> 00:47:44.845
And we see that actually in Exodus four, uh, chapter 22,

1027
00:47:44.845 --> 00:47:48.445
where it's used that firstborn is used as a preeminence

1028
00:47:48.445 --> 00:47:52.045
where he says that Israel, my firstborn, that

1029
00:47:52.475 --> 00:47:55.485
that Israel wasn't the first of many sons, right?

1030
00:47:55.585 --> 00:47:57.805
Israel was the chosen people of God.

1031
00:47:57.825 --> 00:48:02.045
And so he, Israel had a preeminence because of God's choice.

1032
00:48:02.185 --> 00:48:04.365
And so it also goes on to say in cautions

1033
00:48:04.365 --> 00:48:06.045
that all things are created in him

1034
00:48:06.105 --> 00:48:08.845
and through him that he's not part of the created,

1035
00:48:09.275 --> 00:48:10.525
that he was a creator,

1036
00:48:10.585 --> 00:48:12.445
and things are created in him and through him.

1037
00:48:13.585 --> 00:48:16.045
So the last question is, if Jesus is God,

1038
00:48:16.105 --> 00:48:17.285
why didn't he just say it?

1039
00:48:18.225 --> 00:48:21.045
And so we would say He did, right?

1040
00:48:21.065 --> 00:48:22.925
He said it all throughout the Book of John,

1041
00:48:22.925 --> 00:48:24.325
he said it in the Book of Revelations.

1042
00:48:24.345 --> 00:48:26.485
In fact, they tried to kill Jesus

1043
00:48:26.485 --> 00:48:29.805
because of his proclamation, uh, through his words

1044
00:48:30.155 --> 00:48:31.365
that he was God.

1045
00:48:31.785 --> 00:48:34.245
And so he did distinguish himself from the Father,

1046
00:48:34.345 --> 00:48:36.245
but also did, also identified

1047
00:48:36.245 --> 00:48:37.525
himself as one with the Father.

1048
00:48:37.825 --> 00:48:40.005
And that's really what got him in so much trouble.

1049
00:48:40.985 --> 00:48:44.925
And so, um, as we get to the end of this, I, I hope

1050
00:48:44.925 --> 00:48:47.845
that it's a little bit more clear and not less.

1051
00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:49.645
I know I've kind of thrown a lot of stuff out there.

1052
00:48:50.045 --> 00:48:51.525
I do wanna take some time to ask questions.

1053
00:48:51.525 --> 00:48:54.245
So I may ask Aaron to come up while we answer questions,

1054
00:48:54.345 --> 00:48:55.525
but if you have questions,

1055
00:48:55.525 --> 00:48:56.845
start making your way to the microphone.

1056
00:48:57.625 --> 00:49:00.165
And, um, while you're doing so, I'll keep talking

1057
00:49:00.335 --> 00:49:01.965
until somebody gets to a microphone.

1058
00:49:02.665 --> 00:49:05.445
So if you have a question, go to a microphone. Thank you.

1059
00:49:06.065 --> 00:49:08.045
Um, but one of the things he said

1060
00:49:08.865 --> 00:49:10.365
in thinking about the Trinity is trying

1061
00:49:10.365 --> 00:49:11.605
to connect the trinity, sorry,

1062
00:49:11.605 --> 00:49:13.245
I didn't warn Aaron about the fly paper.

1063
00:49:14.105 --> 00:49:17.285
Um, that we wanna connect the Trinity back to the gospel.

1064
00:49:17.465 --> 00:49:19.885
So look for the father, look for the son, look

1065
00:49:19.885 --> 00:49:22.045
for the spirit working in, in the gospel

1066
00:49:22.705 --> 00:49:24.205
and how we are saved, right?

1067
00:49:24.675 --> 00:49:27.285
That, that the, the father, the son,

1068
00:49:27.285 --> 00:49:28.765
the Spirit were president creation.

1069
00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:30.045
They created this perfect world.

1070
00:49:30.505 --> 00:49:32.325
And then we saw in Genesis three

1071
00:49:32.325 --> 00:49:34.805
after the fall that it was identified, he said

1072
00:49:34.995 --> 00:49:36.165
that he's become like us.

1073
00:49:36.225 --> 00:49:39.165
So that, that we as people become separated

1074
00:49:39.585 --> 00:49:41.405
and then how the Father, son Spirit work

1075
00:49:41.605 --> 00:49:42.685
together in our redemption.

1076
00:49:43.345 --> 00:49:45.605
Uh, that, that that allows us to kind

1077
00:49:45.605 --> 00:49:48.805
of even look and dig a little bit deeper. How do

1078
00:49:49.545 --> 00:49:50.545
Aye. Uh,

1079
00:49:50.545 --> 00:49:51.465

1080
00:49:55.215 --> 00:49:56.385
Okay, now you can hear me.

1081
00:49:56.965 --> 00:49:58.985
Uh, first I was gonna say thanks for, uh,

1082
00:49:59.525 --> 00:50:00.985
the church taking on hard topics.

1083
00:50:01.725 --> 00:50:03.025
Uh, it's better

1084
00:50:03.045 --> 00:50:05.105
to talk about things even though we don't understand it,

1085
00:50:05.645 --> 00:50:07.505
but it's better to talk about than shy away.

1086
00:50:08.325 --> 00:50:12.465
Uh, and my question is, it's coming from Matthew 24 36.

1087
00:50:13.165 --> 00:50:16.665
Uh, this is where it's talking about the, the second coming

1088
00:50:17.365 --> 00:50:20.625
and it says, but concerning that day, our no one knows,

1089
00:50:21.045 --> 00:50:22.225
not even the angels of heaven

1090
00:50:22.685 --> 00:50:24.505
nor the son, but only the Father.

1091
00:50:25.405 --> 00:50:28.605
Uh, and I know that that says in my notes,

1092
00:50:28.675 --> 00:50:31.325
it's some trans translations don't have

1093
00:50:31.325 --> 00:50:32.765
that part nor the sun.

1094
00:50:33.585 --> 00:50:35.365
But just wanted to get your thoughts

1095
00:50:35.385 --> 00:50:38.685
and clarifying how we could look at that verse

1096
00:50:39.195 --> 00:50:41.285
amongst all the other verses that talk about the trinity.

1097
00:50:45.235 --> 00:50:48.685
Good. Um, I think that's a tricky one.

1098
00:50:48.985 --> 00:50:51.405
Um, and I think that, um,

1099
00:50:54.535 --> 00:50:59.445
there, I think it, it clearly says it, so we have

1100
00:50:59.445 --> 00:51:03.765
to take it at its word, um, relative to that.

1101
00:51:04.145 --> 00:51:05.565
But we would say, how do we, how do we come

1102
00:51:05.565 --> 00:51:06.645
to grips with that, right?

1103
00:51:06.725 --> 00:51:09.445
I think is the question that no one can knows the day

1104
00:51:09.465 --> 00:51:11.245
or the hour, not even the angels of heaven

1105
00:51:11.385 --> 00:51:15.285
nor the son, but the father only.

1106
00:51:15.905 --> 00:51:20.075
And so, um, well that's tricky

1107
00:51:20.625 --> 00:51:24.465
that, um, there would, there would be is that the,

1108
00:51:24.685 --> 00:51:27.625
the son is manifest as Jesus, or that's not even right.

1109
00:51:27.645 --> 00:51:29.385
I'm gonna say that wrong way. You say it a better way here.

1110
00:51:29.485 --> 00:51:31.705
I'm gonna think for a second if you have a response.

1111
00:51:31.775 --> 00:51:34.065
Yeah, that's one of those we don't quite understand.

1112
00:51:34.505 --> 00:51:39.425
'cause how can, uh, God, Christ be fully God

1113
00:51:39.445 --> 00:51:42.305
and not be able to communicate everything to each other?

1114
00:51:42.765 --> 00:51:45.865
Uh, so yeah, that's one of those things we just have

1115
00:51:45.865 --> 00:51:48.825
to say we don't know how, that's how that works out.

1116
00:51:49.805 --> 00:51:53.625
Um, you know, it's kinda like Jesus grew in favor with God

1117
00:51:53.625 --> 00:51:58.335
and man, Luke 2 52, how does that,

1118
00:51:58.555 --> 00:51:59.655
how, how does that work out?

1119
00:51:59.785 --> 00:52:01.655
Jesus grew in favor with God.

1120
00:52:02.115 --> 00:52:05.255
So there's just some things there that we just quite can't,

1121
00:52:05.905 --> 00:52:09.655
again, comprehend on our level that we just have to say,

1122
00:52:09.805 --> 00:52:11.855
Lord, I, we trust you at your word,

1123
00:52:11.995 --> 00:52:15.095
but we don't quite understand how that works out.

1124
00:52:15.635 --> 00:52:16.815
That's a, that's a great question.

1125
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:22.455
And I think part of it too is like we, we think

1126
00:52:22.475 --> 00:52:25.415
so linearly that we think, we think about a date, right?

1127
00:52:25.415 --> 00:52:28.495
We think about October 27th, 2075.

1128
00:52:29.025 --> 00:52:32.495
Don't nobody write that down, but like, I just made that up.

1129
00:52:32.675 --> 00:52:35.575
But like, we would think of some number out there that

1130
00:52:35.575 --> 00:52:37.455
that's the day that, that the Lord's

1131
00:52:37.455 --> 00:52:38.535
gonna come back and return.

1132
00:52:39.355 --> 00:52:43.095
And that's a limitation of our mind of the flesh.

1133
00:52:43.755 --> 00:52:44.755
And that, um,

1134
00:52:48.275 --> 00:52:49.335
To say, I'm so sorry.

1135
00:52:49.405 --> 00:52:53.335
Yeah, but with Christ being holy man and holy God,

1136
00:52:54.035 --> 00:52:56.735
but in some aspect he did have to, he had

1137
00:52:56.735 --> 00:52:57.975
to step away from his glory,

1138
00:52:58.075 --> 00:53:02.535
but wouldn't have to also kind of going to

1139
00:53:02.535 --> 00:53:07.005
that question, I would think he would in some aspect not,

1140
00:53:07.665 --> 00:53:09.965
and I don't wanna blast him or, or any of that,

1141
00:53:10.025 --> 00:53:13.285
but there would be some limitation to his being able

1142
00:53:13.425 --> 00:53:17.965
and being in a physical man body where we have

1143
00:53:17.965 --> 00:53:20.165
that limitation because of our flesh.

1144
00:53:20.825 --> 00:53:23.565
And it's not necessarily because of simpleness, but it's

1145
00:53:23.565 --> 00:53:26.565
because it hasn't yet been revealed to us.

1146
00:53:27.015 --> 00:53:28.965
Would that in the same aspect,

1147
00:53:29.315 --> 00:53:33.605
because he's fully banned in that, in that present time

1148
00:53:33.735 --> 00:53:36.955
where it hasn't, do you?

1149
00:53:37.425 --> 00:53:39.995
Yeah. Do you understand where I'm coming from? Would that be

1150
00:53:40.985 --> 00:53:41.985
Right?

1151
00:53:42.125 --> 00:53:44.695
Yeah. It's, it is, it is super hard to, to kind

1152
00:53:44.695 --> 00:53:48.815
of unpack the fullness of what we call the hypostatic union.

1153
00:53:48.845 --> 00:53:51.815
That in essence that, that Jesus had fully essence of God.

1154
00:53:51.815 --> 00:53:53.775
He never gave up one ounce of his deity,

1155
00:53:54.115 --> 00:53:55.295
but yet he took on flesh.

1156
00:53:55.725 --> 00:53:59.535
Okay? So it, it, it may be a struggle to say limitation,

1157
00:53:59.535 --> 00:54:00.735
but he took on flesh

1158
00:54:01.085 --> 00:54:02.695
that he was still a hundred percent God.

1159
00:54:02.695 --> 00:54:05.135
He didn't give up or like,

1160
00:54:06.515 --> 00:54:10.295
but the, the, the way that was expressed, the way the son,

1161
00:54:11.195 --> 00:54:14.255
he was in the flesh for 33 years, right?

1162
00:54:14.875 --> 00:54:16.975
And so during that time, he experienced hunger.

1163
00:54:17.595 --> 00:54:19.735
He didn't experience hunger any different than I

1164
00:54:19.735 --> 00:54:20.975
experienced hunger.

1165
00:54:21.295 --> 00:54:22.735
'cause he had a fleshly body,

1166
00:54:23.275 --> 00:54:27.855
but yet, um, he still was fully God so that

1167
00:54:28.675 --> 00:54:33.205
he was able to work through

1168
00:54:33.205 --> 00:54:34.205
that differently, right?

1169
00:54:34.285 --> 00:54:35.765
I mean, he could make bread for himself, I guess,

1170
00:54:35.765 --> 00:54:37.445
if we wanted to, but he, but he didn't, right?

1171
00:54:37.525 --> 00:54:41.645
I mean, so to to back to the question a little bit of

1172
00:54:41.995 --> 00:54:43.765
that it wasn't that there are,

1173
00:54:45.465 --> 00:54:47.485
he says not the son, but the father only.

1174
00:54:47.505 --> 00:54:49.805
And so we have to, we do have to take that at its word.

1175
00:54:49.825 --> 00:54:50.825
And then

1176
00:54:53.565 --> 00:54:54.705
If Say that there are some,

1177
00:54:54.725 --> 00:54:55.725
Excuse me, sorry. Yeah.

1178
00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:59.905
Um, I also think some of that is Hebrew wedding,

1179
00:55:00.965 --> 00:55:02.945
um, language, if you will,

1180
00:55:03.135 --> 00:55:06.465
because the son would go

1181
00:55:06.805 --> 00:55:11.345
and get his bride, get betrothed, go back home,

1182
00:55:12.355 --> 00:55:14.905
build his brides home.

1183
00:55:15.525 --> 00:55:19.145
And when the father said the son was finished,

1184
00:55:19.725 --> 00:55:22.985
the son didn't know when the father would say the father

1185
00:55:23.195 --> 00:55:24.625
chose the time and date,

1186
00:55:24.765 --> 00:55:27.545
and the father would then tell the son, go get your bride.

1187
00:55:27.845 --> 00:55:31.185
And it, to me, it's kind of like Hebrew wedding language,

1188
00:55:31.755 --> 00:55:32.755
Right? Yeah,

1189
00:55:32.755 --> 00:55:34.105
that's, I mean, that's

1190
00:55:34.105 --> 00:55:35.105
A good point. And I agree

1191
00:55:35.105 --> 00:55:37.785
and I think there's too, there's a,

1192
00:55:37.785 --> 00:55:39.345
there's a hierarchy there where,

1193
00:55:39.345 --> 00:55:41.985
where Christ is subordinating himself right

1194
00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:43.705
At that time To his father in

1195
00:55:43.705 --> 00:55:44.705
That position, right?

1196
00:55:44.825 --> 00:55:47.265
Absolutely. Right. So yeah, there are, yeah.

1197
00:55:47.425 --> 00:55:48.425
'cause there's, and we see the,

1198
00:55:48.805 --> 00:55:50.265
the prayer in the garden in different

1199
00:55:50.265 --> 00:55:51.385
times where they're relating.

1200
00:55:52.165 --> 00:55:55.865
Um, and it's that, um, it's that submission that's

1201
00:55:57.065 --> 00:55:58.285
in that perfect relationship.

1202
00:56:00.905 --> 00:56:01.905
What's the next question?

1203
00:56:04.305 --> 00:56:07.725
So ti just what people are thinking, why does, why does

1204
00:56:08.305 --> 00:56:09.845
the study of the Trinity matter?

1205
00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:12.645
What, what is the, I think John raised

1206
00:56:12.645 --> 00:56:15.525
that question on Sunday, you know, it's one

1207
00:56:15.525 --> 00:56:19.005
of our big rocks, but why, why is the Trinity matter?

1208
00:56:20.305 --> 00:56:23.485
That's a maybe a question that people may be asking. Yeah,

1209
00:56:23.605 --> 00:56:24.605
I think that's good. Why

1210
00:56:24.605 --> 00:56:25.845
would we devote a whole week to it?

1211
00:56:25.845 --> 00:56:27.245
Well, I think part of it's

1212
00:56:27.245 --> 00:56:30.085
because we do see so many false teachings

1213
00:56:30.085 --> 00:56:31.405
and heresies come out of it.

1214
00:56:32.025 --> 00:56:35.485
And so, and some of them can start from a place that seem

1215
00:56:35.705 --> 00:56:38.165
to have some reason, and they come from a place that would,

1216
00:56:38.165 --> 00:56:40.165
that would have worldly logic.

1217
00:56:40.425 --> 00:56:43.405
And we would say, oh, yeah, three in one that's like a,

1218
00:56:43.585 --> 00:56:46.005
an egg or a whatever, different thing.

1219
00:56:46.825 --> 00:56:48.245
But yet it takes us off track.

1220
00:56:48.305 --> 00:56:50.285
And so if we don't understand

1221
00:56:50.285 --> 00:56:52.565
and know the truths of God's word

1222
00:56:52.565 --> 00:56:54.725
and what it says relative to the father, son spirit,

1223
00:56:55.225 --> 00:56:58.365
and how they, they perfectly are as one essence,

1224
00:56:59.235 --> 00:57:02.525
then we can, we can diminish one or the other.

1225
00:57:02.525 --> 00:57:05.245
Right? We can. And that steals glory from God.

1226
00:57:05.825 --> 00:57:07.445
And so when we can get,

1227
00:57:07.445 --> 00:57:10.805
be let off into these false teachings, whether that be

1228
00:57:11.965 --> 00:57:16.165
modalism or a, a, a, a creation of,

1229
00:57:16.585 --> 00:57:19.125
of Son or the spirit like that,

1230
00:57:19.585 --> 00:57:22.125
it really takes away from the glory of who God is.

1231
00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:24.045
And so that's, then we're,

1232
00:57:24.045 --> 00:57:25.605
then we're off on some rabbit trail.

1233
00:57:25.615 --> 00:57:27.685
Right? Um, and,

1234
00:57:27.685 --> 00:57:29.445
and it is just one of those things where to know,

1235
00:57:29.625 --> 00:57:31.245
to recognize the false teachings,

1236
00:57:31.245 --> 00:57:32.725
you really do have to understand the truth.

1237
00:57:33.265 --> 00:57:34.765
And because, and you have

1238
00:57:34.765 --> 00:57:36.845
to understand when people are twisting scripture

1239
00:57:37.105 --> 00:57:39.005
for their own end and their own gain.

1240
00:57:39.425 --> 00:57:41.725
So to know about the truth of scripture allows us

1241
00:57:41.725 --> 00:57:44.525
to speak truth and when we're, when we're asked about lies.

1242
00:57:46.255 --> 00:57:48.165
Thank You. Yeah, go ahead Albert. Okay.

1243
00:57:48.825 --> 00:57:51.365
We pray, and we all oftentimes say

1244
00:57:51.365 --> 00:57:53.405
that the Trinity's all equal God,

1245
00:57:53.425 --> 00:57:55.365
the Father God son, godly Holy Spirit.

1246
00:57:55.785 --> 00:57:57.485
But our prayers, we pray to God.

1247
00:57:57.745 --> 00:58:00.765
We pray to Jesus, but rarely do we pray to the Holy Spirit.

1248
00:58:01.385 --> 00:58:03.645
Are we derelict in doing that? Or is it good or bad?

1249
00:58:06.845 --> 00:58:08.255
Yeah. No, I think it's perfectly fine

1250
00:58:08.315 --> 00:58:09.455
to pray to the Holy Spirit.

1251
00:58:09.645 --> 00:58:11.095
They're all, it's all one,

1252
00:58:11.355 --> 00:58:13.695
But we don't, uh, But we don't. Yeah, you're right.

1253
00:58:13.915 --> 00:58:15.695
The last time you heard a prayer said, dear Holy Spirit,

1254
00:58:15.865 --> 00:58:16.865
Right.

1255
00:58:16.975 --> 00:58:18.175
I have heard people say that.

1256
00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:22.535
Uh, but even Christ prayed our Father in heaven, right?

1257
00:58:22.645 --> 00:58:24.895
When you pray, pray like this, our Father in heaven.

1258
00:58:25.795 --> 00:58:27.015
Uh, so he kind

1259
00:58:27.015 --> 00:58:29.215
of gave us some instruction there of how to pray.

1260
00:58:29.275 --> 00:58:31.775
But I think absolutely you can pray.

1261
00:58:32.125 --> 00:58:34.375
It's he's three persons in one.

1262
00:58:34.395 --> 00:58:37.375
You can pray all three of those. Absolutely.

1263
00:58:38.195 --> 00:58:39.975
Should we, should we intentionally try

1264
00:58:39.975 --> 00:58:42.375
to include the Holy Spirit when we address our prayers?

1265
00:58:44.685 --> 00:58:49.165
Probably should, Yeah. I think, um, yes.

1266
00:58:49.265 --> 00:58:50.805
But I don't know if we grieve him

1267
00:58:51.465 --> 00:58:53.205
unless we're consciously doing it.

1268
00:58:53.265 --> 00:58:54.805
If we're, if we're saying, I'm not gonna pray the Holy

1269
00:58:54.805 --> 00:58:58.165
Spirit, 'cause I don't think he's a person, right?

1270
00:58:58.485 --> 00:59:00.765
'cause I think he's just an energy

1271
00:59:02.015 --> 00:59:04.795
and I'm, I don't really believe he's God, then

1272
00:59:05.025 --> 00:59:06.395
that does, that grieves the Spirit.

1273
00:59:06.395 --> 00:59:07.755
That's, that's grieving the Spirit,

1274
00:59:07.755 --> 00:59:10.875
that's blaspheming the spirit in some ways.

1275
00:59:11.575 --> 00:59:15.915
And so, yes. But if we're saying, God, father,

1276
00:59:16.175 --> 00:59:20.195
I'm praying to you in the name of your son Jesus empowered

1277
00:59:20.195 --> 00:59:22.285
because of the work or the words that are coming out,

1278
00:59:22.285 --> 00:59:24.365
because of the work of your spirit in me.

1279
00:59:25.505 --> 00:59:27.565
And we see that modeled in scripture, right.

1280
00:59:27.565 --> 00:59:29.125
That the, the Spirit prays

1281
00:59:29.125 --> 00:59:30.645
for us when we don't have the words

1282
00:59:30.665 --> 00:59:33.885
to say He empowers our prayers that we lift in the name

1283
00:59:33.885 --> 00:59:35.085
of the Son to the Father.

1284
00:59:35.635 --> 00:59:37.805
It's not wrong, I don't think to, to pray

1285
00:59:38.585 --> 00:59:40.765
to any person of the Trinity.

1286
00:59:40.785 --> 00:59:43.485
But we would, we would pray to God, right?

1287
00:59:43.505 --> 00:59:45.405
We would pray to our trying God

1288
00:59:46.265 --> 00:59:48.085
and relate in the different ways, I think,

1289
00:59:48.085 --> 00:59:49.645
in which he relates to us.

1290
00:59:50.695 --> 00:59:54.135
Thank you. Good question, Albert.

1291
00:59:55.275 --> 00:59:58.415
Uh, mine comes from Genesis one,

1292
00:59:58.595 --> 01:00:00.055
and you referenced this earlier, tr

1293
01:00:00.515 --> 01:00:05.055
but in 1 26, when God said, let us make man in our image

1294
01:00:05.065 --> 01:00:06.135
after our likeness,

1295
01:00:06.715 --> 01:00:08.815
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea

1296
01:00:09.115 --> 01:00:10.895
and over the birds of the heavens from the livestock

1297
01:00:10.895 --> 01:00:12.495
and over all the earth and over every creeping thing

1298
01:00:12.495 --> 01:00:13.815
that creeps on the earth.

1299
01:00:14.555 --> 01:00:16.855
Um, my question is one of those ones, you,

1300
01:00:16.855 --> 01:00:18.055
you're talking about kind of

1301
01:00:20.415 --> 01:00:22.455
refining our understanding without getting to a,

1302
01:00:22.635 --> 01:00:27.135
an absolute is, um, is a worthy pursuit to understand God

1303
01:00:27.135 --> 01:00:29.695
and our relationship to him on the topic

1304
01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:32.215
of us being image bearers of God

1305
01:00:33.195 --> 01:00:37.255
and his, uh, relational nature.

1306
01:00:38.075 --> 01:00:41.175
Is that a common grace or, or is it accurate

1307
01:00:41.175 --> 01:00:45.135
or dangerous to think of us being relational beings as a one

1308
01:00:45.135 --> 01:00:46.575
of the attributes, as image bearers

1309
01:00:46.575 --> 01:00:49.095
of God being a relational being within himself?

1310
01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:52.895
And is that a common grace to believers and believers alike?

1311
01:00:55.555 --> 01:00:57.095
And are there, are there errors or,

1312
01:00:57.095 --> 01:00:58.375
or slippery slopes that,

1313
01:00:58.375 --> 01:01:01.175
that can go considering it that way?

1314
01:01:03.305 --> 01:01:04.475
Does the question make sense? Mm-Hmm.

1315
01:01:04.555 --> 01:01:05.795
Yeah. It makes perfect. I think that's a,

1316
01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:06.875
that's a great deep question.

1317
01:01:07.015 --> 01:01:09.155
Uh, I think, I think in a lot of ways it is.

1318
01:01:10.055 --> 01:01:13.635
Um, it's interesting though, if we think about the rest of

1319
01:01:13.635 --> 01:01:14.835
that creation narrative, right?

1320
01:01:14.895 --> 01:01:18.195
So he made Adam, he made Adam in his likeness,

1321
01:01:18.215 --> 01:01:22.675
and then Adam had relationship with God,

1322
01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:27.875
but he, he saw that he also needed another person.

1323
01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:30.355
Mm-Hmm. I mean, obviously God is sovereign.

1324
01:01:30.355 --> 01:01:34.235
He's all knowing. And, and he, he created them perfectly

1325
01:01:34.295 --> 01:01:36.435
and then they were in relationship with one another.

1326
01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:40.595
Um, and then so we would see the brokenness

1327
01:01:40.595 --> 01:01:43.195
of all the interpersonal, all the interrelatedness, well,

1328
01:01:43.195 --> 01:01:44.995
Even greatest, greatest commandment, right?

1329
01:01:44.995 --> 01:01:47.235
The two, two sides of that kind of same coin of love, God

1330
01:01:47.615 --> 01:01:49.075
and others, that, that relational.

1331
01:01:49.335 --> 01:01:51.115
So I, I think to answer your question, yes,

1332
01:01:51.115 --> 01:01:54.755
that is a common grace that's extended to us as

1333
01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:58.555
people made in his likeness, that part of

1334
01:01:58.555 --> 01:02:01.675
what makes us in his likeness is the way that we,

1335
01:02:02.535 --> 01:02:04.995
or the way that we do, but that we can

1336
01:02:05.095 --> 01:02:07.315
and have a desire to relate to one another.

1337
01:02:07.735 --> 01:02:09.755
And also that there's something in us that,

1338
01:02:09.865 --> 01:02:11.595
that longs for our creator.

1339
01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:12.695
Mm-Hmm.

1340
01:02:13.225 --> 01:02:16.875
Okay. Thanks. And that desire for a relationship

1341
01:02:16.875 --> 01:02:18.595
with him as part of that,

1342
01:02:20.215 --> 01:02:21.845
Could I offer, Is everybody over here?

1343
01:02:22.185 --> 01:02:24.005
No. Okay. Sorry. Mark.

1344
01:02:24.135 --> 01:02:25.805
Could I, I just wanna offer one comment

1345
01:02:25.955 --> 01:02:28.005
that I think addresses two of the questions.

1346
01:02:28.105 --> 01:02:31.645
You know, one is, um, addressing the question

1347
01:02:31.745 --> 01:02:33.645
of should we pray to the Holy Spirit or not?

1348
01:02:34.385 --> 01:02:37.925
And then, um, the question

1349
01:02:37.925 --> 01:02:41.325
before that, I'm, um, blanking on it,

1350
01:02:41.385 --> 01:02:45.165
but the, in John John 14, um,

1351
01:02:46.155 --> 01:02:49.045
15 and 16, Jesus says, if you love me,

1352
01:02:49.045 --> 01:02:50.965
you'll keep my commandments and I'll ask the Father,

1353
01:02:50.985 --> 01:02:53.525
and he will give you another helper to be with you forever,

1354
01:02:54.555 --> 01:02:57.645
even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive.

1355
01:02:57.745 --> 01:02:59.645
So it really addresses the question

1356
01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:01.245
of why should we know about the Holy Spirit?

1357
01:03:01.385 --> 01:03:04.885
Why should we think about these three persons

1358
01:03:04.885 --> 01:03:06.405
that make up the Godhead?

1359
01:03:06.905 --> 01:03:10.165
And I think that knowing the correct relationship

1360
01:03:10.185 --> 01:03:13.885
of the three helps us when we pray,

1361
01:03:14.305 --> 01:03:16.805
and Jesus instructed us to pray in this way.

1362
01:03:16.865 --> 01:03:20.005
He instructed us to pray our Father who art in heaven,

1363
01:03:20.675 --> 01:03:24.125
that when we pray, we know that we have a helper who's

1364
01:03:24.125 --> 01:03:27.685
with us, who is expressing, as Paul says, things

1365
01:03:27.685 --> 01:03:30.405
that are sometimes too deep for us to express.

1366
01:03:30.625 --> 01:03:33.125
Mm-Hmm. And so if we have that correct understanding,

1367
01:03:33.425 --> 01:03:36.725
we know that as we pray with our limited vocabulary

1368
01:03:36.725 --> 01:03:38.765
and words and understandings, we know

1369
01:03:38.765 --> 01:03:42.125
that Jesus promises us, that the Holy Spirit is

1370
01:03:43.515 --> 01:03:45.445
praying, communicating somehow

1371
01:03:45.515 --> 01:03:47.245
with the Father on our behalf.

1372
01:03:47.835 --> 01:03:50.565
He's expressing things that we don't know how to express

1373
01:03:51.705 --> 01:03:53.805
on our behalf, which is another

1374
01:03:54.475 --> 01:03:56.445
strange thing for us to think about.

1375
01:03:56.545 --> 01:04:00.445
How does, how do our prayers to the Father, uh, need

1376
01:04:00.445 --> 01:04:05.405
to be explained or need to be Expressed to the Father?

1377
01:04:05.465 --> 01:04:08.005
But Jesus said he does that He labors for us,

1378
01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.045
and that Jesus is also there at the

1379
01:04:10.045 --> 01:04:11.165
right hand of the Father.

1380
01:04:11.345 --> 01:04:14.165
It says on our behalf,

1381
01:04:15.025 --> 01:04:16.365
as it says in Hebrews four.

1382
01:04:17.025 --> 01:04:20.005
Um, so, um, anyway, I just thought as,

1383
01:04:20.005 --> 01:04:21.565
as I was thinking about those two questions,

1384
01:04:22.005 --> 01:04:24.485
a correct understanding helps us know the relationship,

1385
01:04:24.985 --> 01:04:27.525
and then when we pray, we can pray to the Father knowing

1386
01:04:27.525 --> 01:04:29.165
that Jesus is hearing it,

1387
01:04:29.245 --> 01:04:32.725
and the Holy Spirit's there also laboring on our behalf.

1388
01:04:34.225 --> 01:04:35.605
That's a great word. Thank you, mark.

1389
01:04:35.865 --> 01:04:40.205
And yes, in John 14 through 17, if you just wanna read

1390
01:04:40.205 --> 01:04:41.245
and marvel at the Trinity

1391
01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:42.965
and Father sin spirit, working together,

1392
01:04:43.015 --> 01:04:44.245
spend time in those chapters.

1393
01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:58.585
You got any other good questions? Gosh. Okay.

1394
01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:00.425
Pray for, yeah.

1395
01:05:00.845 --> 01:05:03.105
Um, yeah, I think we're, we're too a good spot.

1396
01:05:03.105 --> 01:05:04.305
We pray for us. So we'll close.

1397
01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:08.825
Yeah. Let's pray together. Lord, we are grateful

1398
01:05:08.845 --> 01:05:13.305
to have an evening like this where we can, um, talk about

1399
01:05:14.295 --> 01:05:18.085
your word and how to, uh,

1400
01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:22.755
relate to you by how you have revealed yourself to us.

1401
01:05:22.935 --> 01:05:24.915
And so we're grateful, we're grateful

1402
01:05:24.915 --> 01:05:28.475
that you didn't leave us here alone without, uh,

1403
01:05:28.575 --> 01:05:31.195
any guidance or anything about you.

1404
01:05:31.285 --> 01:05:32.355
Thank you for your word

1405
01:05:32.355 --> 01:05:35.315
and how you've revealed yourself through the scriptures

1406
01:05:35.535 --> 01:05:38.035
and through Christ, through your creation.

1407
01:05:39.375 --> 01:05:44.195
We worship you, uh, God and the Father.

1408
01:05:44.295 --> 01:05:48.155
We worship God the Son, and we worship God the Spirit.

1409
01:05:48.255 --> 01:05:49.595
We are grateful for all three,

1410
01:05:50.255 --> 01:05:52.235
but we're grateful for the one.

1411
01:05:53.095 --> 01:05:54.595
And, uh, so thank you.

1412
01:05:55.445 --> 01:05:58.435
Thank you, Lord, for, uh, the truths of your word.

1413
01:05:58.435 --> 01:06:00.475
Thank you for tr and all of his preparation,

1414
01:06:01.815 --> 01:06:05.355
and we pray tonight that, uh, you'll bless us as we go and,

1415
01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:07.435
and just continue to enlighten us

1416
01:06:07.535 --> 01:06:09.915
as we open up your word, St.

1417
01:06:09.915 --> 01:06:13.675
Christ. And we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you all.
