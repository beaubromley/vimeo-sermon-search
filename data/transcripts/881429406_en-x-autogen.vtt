1
00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:09.845
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:14.605
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

3
00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:22.885
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth

4
00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:30.725
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

5
00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:36.245
When Christ who is your life appears,

6
00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:38.565
then you will also appear with him and glory.

7
00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:04.805
Well, good morning church. You all looked refreshed after that. Uh,

8
00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:07.205
extra hour of sleep last night. Uh,

9
00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:10.365
except for you young parents where your kids woke up an hour early this morning.

10
00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:13.965
I know that feeling. We've done that before in our lives. Uh,

11
00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:16.245
if you're new here, we're grateful you would choose to gather with us.

12
00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:17.645
It's an honor that you would,

13
00:01:17.785 --> 00:01:19.605
and we wanna get to know you and meet you if we can.

14
00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:22.805
So please come say hello to us up here at the front after there's a big new here

15
00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:26.325
section out there. We'd love to help you connect to our church.

16
00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.365
Hope you feel welcomed and encouraged.

17
00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:31.125
I know it's hard to visit a new church and so we wanna invite you to,

18
00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:36.685
to take a step forward as God would lead you to be comfortable at that time. Uh,

19
00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:40.125
we're gonna get very practical today in our journey through the New Testament

20
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.405
book of Colossians.

21
00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:46.205
And we're gonna talk today about new creation relationships,

22
00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:51.725
how if you have been made a new creation in Christ through the life,

23
00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:54.525
death and resurrection of Christ or faith in him,

24
00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:58.325
then you are new now.

25
00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:03.485
And so you can put on the new self you've been made new so you

26
00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:08.165
can live a new life. But that doesn't just affect our lives generally,

27
00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:11.045
which we can kind of tend to think that way.

28
00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:15.285
It actually even affects the deepest and the closest

29
00:02:15.555 --> 00:02:18.125
relationships we have on this earth.

30
00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:24.965
Marriage, parenting, the workplace dynamic.

31
00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:28.445
It affects even those things.

32
00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:33.445
And so as I say that before any of you check out of this today

33
00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:37.565
because you're not married or because you don't have kids or because you don't

34
00:02:37.565 --> 00:02:38.445
have a job or whatever,

35
00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:43.405
let me encourage you not to check out immediately because there's gonna

36
00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:46.965
be something today for everyone, for kids.

37
00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:50.445
You'll actually be addressed today directly. Students,

38
00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:52.365
you as well parents,

39
00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:56.205
singles who want to be married.

40
00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:01.615
Even those just kind of questioning how authority works in general.

41
00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.095
Like this is all going to be comprehensive.

42
00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.535
Even if it might not seem like it on the surface,

43
00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:10.255
it's going to actually get to all of us today.

44
00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:15.555
And so take your copy of God's word, turn with me to Colossians chapter three.

45
00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:21.795
Colossians chapter three starting in verse 18 is where we're gonna be today.

46
00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:26.555
And the sections chapter three verse 18 down through chapter four,

47
00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:28.875
verse one. Actually

48
00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:34.875
Colossians three 18 through chapter four, verse one.

49
00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:36.395
Look at it with me.

50
00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:39.315
It'll be on the screen if you don't have one in front of you.

51
00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:45.185
Wives submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord.

52
00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:50.265
Husbands love your wives and do not be harsh with them.

53
00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:55.385
Children obey your parents and everything for this pleases the Lord.

54
00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:01.385
Fathers do not provoke your children lest they become discouraged.

55
00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:06.955
Bond servants, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters.

56
00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:12.315
Not by way of I service as people pleasers, but with sincerity of heart,

57
00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:16.395
fearing the Lord. Whatever you do,

58
00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:20.075
work heartily as for the Lord and not for men.

59
00:04:20.785 --> 00:04:25.195
Knowing that from the Lord you'll receive the inheritance as your reward.

60
00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:28.245
You are serving the Lord Christ.

61
00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:32.405
For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done.

62
00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:36.725
And there is no partiality masters.

63
00:04:36.935 --> 00:04:38.165
Treat your bond servants,

64
00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:43.205
justly and fairly knowing that you also have a master

65
00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:47.165
in heaven. Lord, this is your word.

66
00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:51.315
It's not just for them back then. It's not

67
00:04:53.235 --> 00:04:55.235
just merely words on a page, God.

68
00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:58.435
This is your very words to us.

69
00:05:00.815 --> 00:05:05.155
So we need you to work through those words, to empower your people,

70
00:05:06.295 --> 00:05:09.475
to live out your words and not be hearers. Only.

71
00:05:11.695 --> 00:05:15.595
God, make our hearts right now good soil. Remove distractions from our minds.

72
00:05:15.595 --> 00:05:19.235
Things we might be thinking about from yesterday or this morning or tomorrow

73
00:05:19.425 --> 00:05:21.755
just to say, no God, we want you.

74
00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.675
We wanna see you today.

75
00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:30.425
So help us Holy Spirit speak in Jesus' name.

76
00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:32.368
Amen.

77
00:05:34.405 --> 00:05:37.425
So I know there's some tricky language in this passage and we'll we'll get to

78
00:05:37.425 --> 00:05:38.505
that in a moment, but,

79
00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:42.905
but what's gonna help us first is to understand the difference that Christ made

80
00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:47.665
back then. So when Colossae, when Christ entered their lives,

81
00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:50.945
what was the difference that he would make then?

82
00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:55.145
Remember it was a majority pagan dark environment.

83
00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:56.745
That's where they lived in Colossae.

84
00:05:56.745 --> 00:06:00.925
And so how were Christians to live in that situation?

85
00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:03.175
Well,

86
00:06:03.175 --> 00:06:06.495
part of the context we need to understand when we read this is that a household,

87
00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:11.535
you might say the quote unquote household back then was more than just a single

88
00:06:11.535 --> 00:06:15.495
family unit like it often is today. There was the,

89
00:06:15.495 --> 00:06:19.855
the so-called head of the house, the man of the house, his wife in,

90
00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:20.575
in a household,

91
00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:23.615
there were even adult children and their families that would live with them,

92
00:06:23.805 --> 00:06:27.695
even extended family would often be there. They had servants,

93
00:06:27.695 --> 00:06:31.215
they had employees, they would even have other people that lived with them.

94
00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:35.015
And this was a household in the context here.

95
00:06:35.155 --> 00:06:40.015
So when you see often in scripture these binary pairs, so husband,

96
00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:45.095
wife, master, slave, father, child, like you see these often. Ephesians five,

97
00:06:45.235 --> 00:06:48.335
one, Peter two and three, Titus two. It happens a lot.

98
00:06:48.635 --> 00:06:53.135
That's what it's talking about is this whole household and how they should

99
00:06:53.415 --> 00:06:58.395
interact. And back then this was the common structure for households even,

100
00:06:58.665 --> 00:07:01.155
even for unbelievers. This was not a Christian thing,

101
00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:04.355
this was just the way it was in society.

102
00:07:05.495 --> 00:07:06.435
And so Paul here,

103
00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:11.395
he's not encouraging some kind of subversion to the culture 'cause he's

104
00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:14.115
gonna say next week we'll see in verse five of chapter four,

105
00:07:14.295 --> 00:07:16.195
we should walk in wisdom toward outsiders.

106
00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:19.235
Meaning we should be careful what they think about us.

107
00:07:19.575 --> 00:07:22.875
So he wasn't saying blow the whole system up. He's saying No,

108
00:07:22.895 --> 00:07:25.155
you can live in this system.

109
00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:29.715
He's not bringing anything new to the table in that sense.

110
00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:32.915
But here's what he was doing. He was bringing something very new.

111
00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:39.555
What was new was the way that those household members were to treat one another.

112
00:07:39.615 --> 00:07:40.448
Now

113
00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:47.325
that it wasn't just the law of nature or the law of the culture anymore.

114
00:07:47.325 --> 00:07:51.845
It was the law of Christ that dictated how things

115
00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:53.075
worked out.

116
00:07:53.075 --> 00:07:57.405
What was different Paul's teaching them here was Christ's

117
00:07:57.725 --> 00:08:00.205
Lordship over the household.

118
00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:06.445
What was different was Christ's lordship over

119
00:08:07.265 --> 00:08:12.245
the household that that this was a way to show transformation

120
00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:14.045
to the culture around them.

121
00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:21.305
They couldn't just apply the old worldly ways of doing things anymore.

122
00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:26.905
They had to listen to how God wanted them to do the house

123
00:08:28.965 --> 00:08:31.775
he's Lord over even the household.

124
00:08:33.335 --> 00:08:37.515
But not only is he Lord over the household directing how it's supposed to be,

125
00:08:38.065 --> 00:08:40.875
he's also head within the household.

126
00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:46.455
He's he, he's making a difference here.

127
00:08:46.795 --> 00:08:51.695
Christ is making the difference through his headship within the

128
00:08:51.695 --> 00:08:54.255
household. He's Lord over it saying Here's how it should be set up.

129
00:08:54.595 --> 00:08:59.485
And his headship within the household changes everything.

130
00:09:01.695 --> 00:09:06.415
I wanna be careful to explain this because there have been some sad and

131
00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:09.495
weird things done in the name of headship,

132
00:09:10.465 --> 00:09:12.335
especially in the context of a marriage.

133
00:09:15.285 --> 00:09:19.665
The idea of being the head of something is used all over scripture in various

134
00:09:20.255 --> 00:09:20.865
ways, but,

135
00:09:20.865 --> 00:09:24.585
but we've already seen it back in chapter one here in Colossians chapter one,

136
00:09:24.585 --> 00:09:29.185
verse 18. It says that Christ is the head of the body,

137
00:09:29.365 --> 00:09:33.355
the church. So he's the head of the body.

138
00:09:33.415 --> 00:09:35.315
Yet also chapter two verse 19.

139
00:09:36.335 --> 00:09:41.155
It says that holding fast to the head from whom the

140
00:09:41.155 --> 00:09:46.155
whole body that would be the church nourished and knit together through its

141
00:09:46.155 --> 00:09:50.115
joints and ligaments, it grows with a growth that is from God.

142
00:09:52.415 --> 00:09:57.075
So headship is more than just commanding and

143
00:09:57.145 --> 00:10:01.515
directing how things should go. There's a nourishing and a knitting together.

144
00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:05.715
That's the context in which Ephesians five,

145
00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:09.475
which Colossians and Ephesians are very parallel and he's probably writing them

146
00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:10.555
at the same time to different people.

147
00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:15.595
If Ephesians 5 23 says the husband is the head of the

148
00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:18.915
wife, even as Christ is the head of the church,

149
00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:21.435
his body and is himself its Savior.

150
00:10:23.035 --> 00:10:27.095
So there's a parallel he makes between the headship of Christ on the church and

151
00:10:27.095 --> 00:10:30.055
the headship of a husband with a wife. Now lemme be clear.

152
00:10:30.115 --> 00:10:34.135
In no way is the husband able to save the wife like Christ saves us.

153
00:10:34.405 --> 00:10:38.535
That doesn't parallel there of course, but this means,

154
00:10:38.595 --> 00:10:39.495
and hear this clearly,

155
00:10:40.035 --> 00:10:44.535
the form of headship that a husband has is

156
00:10:44.835 --> 00:10:49.715
shaped by Christ, right? He puts those together.

157
00:10:52.365 --> 00:10:56.385
And so think about what Christ did for his bride,

158
00:10:57.225 --> 00:10:58.058
for the church.

159
00:11:01.535 --> 00:11:04.995
He loved her by dying for her,

160
00:11:06.475 --> 00:11:10.785
by sacrificing for her, by Colossians two,

161
00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.705
nourishing her, protecting her.

162
00:11:17.235 --> 00:11:18.405
Mark 10 45,

163
00:11:18.535 --> 00:11:23.445
Jesus said even the son of man came not to be served but

164
00:11:23.505 --> 00:11:28.085
to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many

165
00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:33.955
so Christ headship within the home,

166
00:11:34.935 --> 00:11:36.995
not just the church within the home here.

167
00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:41.515
It changes the way we exemplify headship in our

168
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:46.715
relationships. And that was what was totally revolutionary in Colossi

169
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:53.065
because a husband who back then had every right to demand his wife,

170
00:11:53.085 --> 00:11:54.765
wife to do virtually anything

171
00:11:57.835 --> 00:12:02.365
instead as a new creation he was supposed to keep on loving her.

172
00:12:02.365 --> 00:12:07.085
That's the tense of the verb. To love her in an ongoing way, in a tender way.

173
00:12:07.275 --> 00:12:11.085
He's supposed to care and serve for her like Christ did the church.

174
00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.965
That's a complete revolutionary concept back then.

175
00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:18.018
A parent

176
00:12:19.165 --> 00:12:23.185
who back then treated their children very little differently than a hired hand,

177
00:12:23.605 --> 00:12:25.185
as a, a farm laborer.

178
00:12:27.355 --> 00:12:32.325
Instead as a new creation in Christ was to, to not provoke them,

179
00:12:33.755 --> 00:12:37.855
was to lead them in the discipline instruction of the Lord. Ephesians six,

180
00:12:37.855 --> 00:12:40.255
four says, that's a whole different concept.

181
00:12:42.905 --> 00:12:45.165
And so when the husband would do that for his wife,

182
00:12:45.165 --> 00:12:48.445
that that led her to willingly follow his loving leadership.

183
00:12:48.555 --> 00:12:50.325
When a parent did that for a child,

184
00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:54.445
it would lead the child to gladly obey as a way to honor Christ.

185
00:12:54.675 --> 00:12:56.325
That changed the whole thing.

186
00:12:56.505 --> 00:12:58.965
And then you think about this master slave relationship,

187
00:13:00.895 --> 00:13:05.495
a master who back then could treat his bond servants as property with no

188
00:13:05.595 --> 00:13:09.355
rights. Instead he's saying, no,

189
00:13:09.415 --> 00:13:14.315
you to be just and fair with those that

190
00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:18.075
work for you that are in your household, which would lead those servants.

191
00:13:18.075 --> 00:13:18.895
Think about that.

192
00:13:18.895 --> 00:13:22.755
To work hard with sincerity of heart because they know their master cares for

193
00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:26.785
them new creations in Christ.

194
00:13:28.035 --> 00:13:28.725
Again,

195
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:33.625
the the the structure of the household back then might not have

196
00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:36.225
looked much different than the rest of the world around them.

197
00:13:38.575 --> 00:13:43.315
But what was different was Christ's lordship over the household

198
00:13:43.575 --> 00:13:46.235
and Christ's headship within the household.

199
00:13:46.295 --> 00:13:51.235
And that's what would have caused them to stand out in really radical ways

200
00:13:51.385 --> 00:13:56.145
back then. And hear me,

201
00:13:57.335 --> 00:14:01.745
it's still what will make the Christian household today

202
00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:03.305
stand out as well.

203
00:14:06.275 --> 00:14:09.525
This is not just talking about the way things were back then and how different

204
00:14:09.825 --> 00:14:10.658
it could have been.

205
00:14:11.075 --> 00:14:15.125
It's still what will make the Christian household stand out today.

206
00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:17.965
He made a massive difference in a pagan world back then.

207
00:14:18.305 --> 00:14:20.325
He still makes a difference today.

208
00:14:24.595 --> 00:14:27.575
So we're gonna walk back through this and first we're gonna see the difference

209
00:14:27.605 --> 00:14:30.135
that Christ makes in marriage.

210
00:14:31.965 --> 00:14:34.615
Like this new creation kingdom that we live in now,

211
00:14:34.635 --> 00:14:38.375
the new relationships we have because of that, the new self that we are,

212
00:14:38.925 --> 00:14:41.415
look at the difference it makes in a marriage.

213
00:14:43.145 --> 00:14:46.565
It changes it in so many distinct ways. Look again, verses 18 and 19,

214
00:14:49.195 --> 00:14:51.830
wives submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord.

215
00:14:52.645 --> 00:14:56.845
Husbands love your wives and do not be harsh with them.

216
00:14:59.745 --> 00:15:04.445
Now to some verse 18 is pretty patriarchal. See,

217
00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:07.935
this is just Paul trying to keep women down or

218
00:15:09.485 --> 00:15:13.335
that was the way the context was back then. But that doesn't really apply today.

219
00:15:13.385 --> 00:15:15.975
We're in a different stage of history.

220
00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:19.595
Well, remember what I said earlier,

221
00:15:21.455 --> 00:15:26.395
if Paul was just trying to perpetuate the cultural realities

222
00:15:26.575 --> 00:15:29.195
of the time, he absolutely could have done that,

223
00:15:31.045 --> 00:15:31.878
but he didn't.

224
00:15:34.615 --> 00:15:38.185
Even though the structure might look similar, the reality

225
00:15:39.885 --> 00:15:41.625
is that the new creation,

226
00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:45.825
it completely changes the way that husbands and wives interact now

227
00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:49.385
because remember,

228
00:15:49.835 --> 00:15:53.825
God's word never sees women as less than men.

229
00:15:56.215 --> 00:16:01.075
Culture, remember culture at the time did when they were writing this.

230
00:16:01.135 --> 00:16:04.995
But listen, especially to what Paul says,

231
00:16:04.995 --> 00:16:07.355
others say similar things. But this is what Paul says.

232
00:16:07.385 --> 00:16:11.515
Galatians 3 28 and 29 for example, he says,

233
00:16:11.525 --> 00:16:14.995
there is neither talking about the church. Those who have put on Christ.

234
00:16:15.185 --> 00:16:18.635
There's neither Jew nor Greek. There's neither slave nor free.

235
00:16:18.885 --> 00:16:23.195
There is no male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

236
00:16:23.815 --> 00:16:24.795
And if you are Christ,

237
00:16:25.065 --> 00:16:29.755
then you are Abraham's offspring airs according to promise.

238
00:16:31.815 --> 00:16:34.955
Now that phrase, those verses have been really misunderstood.

239
00:16:34.965 --> 00:16:36.595
Don't misunderstand what he's saying.

240
00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:41.435
He's not saying that somehow in Christ you stop being

241
00:16:41.655 --> 00:16:43.235
who God created you to be.

242
00:16:45.715 --> 00:16:48.405
Because remember in that church in Galatia,

243
00:16:48.405 --> 00:16:52.005
some of those people had been born in Jewish families and some had been born

244
00:16:52.005 --> 00:16:54.845
somewhere else. They were Greeks, gentiles,

245
00:16:56.675 --> 00:17:00.845
some were in a slavery situation for whatever reason, while some were free,

246
00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:07.825
some were male and some were female. It,

247
00:17:07.825 --> 00:17:12.105
it's the same thing today, right? I I am still from Fairview,

248
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:17.105
I'm still a man. I'm 40. So that makes me a man, right? So that's like you,

249
00:17:17.105 --> 00:17:21.025
you see how I didn't change any of that when I became a Christian?

250
00:17:22.605 --> 00:17:25.905
You're still from Idabell or wherever you're from, you're still a woman.

251
00:17:25.905 --> 00:17:27.705
You're right. You see how this works out.

252
00:17:27.735 --> 00:17:31.345
It's just that what he's saying there is that in Christ

253
00:17:32.615 --> 00:17:35.705
that means you are all equally saved.

254
00:17:37.735 --> 00:17:40.105
There's no levels in the kingdom, there's no,

255
00:17:40.255 --> 00:17:44.345
there's no hierarchy in the church in a sense like this, right?

256
00:17:44.345 --> 00:17:48.105
You're saved with everyone else. 'cause remember what happened back then.

257
00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:50.085
Remember what there's, he's referring to here.

258
00:17:50.345 --> 00:17:55.165
The culture at the time devalued people who were not Jewish.

259
00:17:56.835 --> 00:18:01.685
They devalued women. They devalued slaves. And so Paul says, no,

260
00:18:01.685 --> 00:18:02.518
no, actually

261
00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:07.645
you're all equal before the cross.

262
00:18:10.045 --> 00:18:14.345
You're all heirs of God's promise. Not just these few people,

263
00:18:14.525 --> 00:18:16.385
not just this situation or this context.

264
00:18:16.685 --> 00:18:19.785
You're all heirs together of God's promise.

265
00:18:22.595 --> 00:18:27.415
And so when you hear this call for wives to submit to their husbands,

266
00:18:27.555 --> 00:18:32.375
it has nothing to do with value or with worth or

267
00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:36.885
with equality. It has to do with order.

268
00:18:38.025 --> 00:18:41.885
And I don't say that meaning the the husband can order his wife around. No,

269
00:18:41.885 --> 00:18:45.125
it's about this idea of leading almost like a dance together, right? Who's,

270
00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:49.725
who's taking the lead in the dance and and hear this

271
00:18:49.835 --> 00:18:50.668
clearly

272
00:18:52.695 --> 00:18:56.695
a husband's role as the head of his wife

273
00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:02.295
is in the spirit of Ephesians chapter five,

274
00:19:03.515 --> 00:19:07.885
verses 25 through 30 clearly says, husbands,

275
00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:09.685
love your wives ongoing.

276
00:19:09.755 --> 00:19:14.725
Keep loving your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for

277
00:19:14.725 --> 00:19:17.525
her that he might sanctify her,

278
00:19:17.545 --> 00:19:21.765
having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word so that he might

279
00:19:21.765 --> 00:19:26.765
present the church to him himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle

280
00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:30.565
or any such thing that she might be holy and without blemish

281
00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:32.925
In the same way

282
00:19:35.295 --> 00:19:38.495
husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.

283
00:19:39.235 --> 00:19:43.055
He who loves his wife actually loves himself for no one ever hated his own

284
00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:43.435
flesh,

285
00:19:43.435 --> 00:19:48.215
but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ does the

286
00:19:48.215 --> 00:19:52.175
church because we are members of his body.

287
00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:57.375
Listen, men, that's what headship is.

288
00:19:59.545 --> 00:20:03.555
That is what headship is in a marriage. It's it's serving,

289
00:20:04.985 --> 00:20:05.995
it's giving.

290
00:20:07.185 --> 00:20:11.075
It's dying to self so you can die for her.

291
00:20:13.915 --> 00:20:18.415
And you saw it in Colossians three, there is zero harshness in that

292
00:20:20.945 --> 00:20:25.605
you are not supposed to demand or be this authoritarian figure.

293
00:20:25.665 --> 00:20:29.845
That's not what headship is. Headship is what Christ did for the church.

294
00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:38.245
And wives, listen as you willingly follow his loving leadership,

295
00:20:39.555 --> 00:20:40.725
it's mutually

296
00:20:42.395 --> 00:20:47.005
serving and giving and dying to self so you can die,

297
00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:47.878
die for him.

298
00:20:49.495 --> 00:20:54.395
It works the best whenever both are giving and serving and dying for

299
00:20:54.395 --> 00:20:58.425
each other. That's how marriage is truly healthy.

300
00:21:01.995 --> 00:21:04.375
But I also want you to notice this women,

301
00:21:06.295 --> 00:21:09.745
this submission we're talking about is not to all men

302
00:21:11.755 --> 00:21:14.325
says in Ephesians five, submit to your own husband

303
00:21:17.535 --> 00:21:20.475
and hear that it is fitting in the Lord.

304
00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:24.635
That means it is making sense according to God's design.

305
00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:29.435
That's the way it's designed to be. Which means that it's ultimately here.

306
00:21:29.435 --> 00:21:34.435
This it's not your husband, it's you're submitting to the Lord ultimately,

307
00:21:35.655 --> 00:21:36.925
right? That's the the,

308
00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:42.205
the idea here is that submission does not trump your submission

309
00:21:42.505 --> 00:21:44.965
to follow the Lord. First and foremost,

310
00:21:45.945 --> 00:21:47.725
the command to follow Jesus.

311
00:21:47.945 --> 00:21:51.085
You should never follow your husband into sin.

312
00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:56.295
You follow Christ above all.

313
00:21:58.045 --> 00:22:02.855
That takes precedence every single time. Which also means husband,

314
00:22:04.475 --> 00:22:06.775
you should not ever lead your wife into sin.

315
00:22:09.195 --> 00:22:10.575
You should not tempt her

316
00:22:12.535 --> 00:22:16.665
that she would drift away from Christ in some way. No, your job,

317
00:22:16.885 --> 00:22:20.745
as Ephesians five said, is to lead her towards sanctification,

318
00:22:21.125 --> 00:22:22.785
not towards sin.

319
00:22:24.925 --> 00:22:29.295
Make it easy to follow that loving leadership

320
00:22:32.985 --> 00:22:37.275
because remember husband Christ is your head too

321
00:22:40.585 --> 00:22:42.885
and he will repay. There is no partiality.

322
00:22:46.295 --> 00:22:49.275
So that's marriage. What about in parenting?

323
00:22:51.755 --> 00:22:55.365
Look at the difference that Christ makes today in parenting as well.

324
00:22:58.505 --> 00:23:03.075
Read again verses 20 and 21 again, the pair here that he puts together.

325
00:23:03.075 --> 00:23:04.075
Verse 20, children,

326
00:23:04.825 --> 00:23:08.195
obey your parents and everything for this pleases the Lord.

327
00:23:09.665 --> 00:23:14.165
And fathers do not provoke your children lest they become discouraged.

328
00:23:16.345 --> 00:23:19.965
Pretty straightforward, right? Not a lot of complicated things, children.

329
00:23:20.035 --> 00:23:24.405
This is a call to you from the beginning of creation

330
00:23:26.145 --> 00:23:30.765
all throughout scripture. The command is obey your parents.

331
00:23:34.025 --> 00:23:38.245
It pleases the Lord. Ephesians six, three says,

332
00:23:38.245 --> 00:23:42.975
it will actually lead life to be better for you, right?

333
00:23:42.975 --> 00:23:45.365
There's actually a reward that comes with it because think about this,

334
00:23:45.845 --> 00:23:50.045
a constantly rebellious attitude. It only brings strife.

335
00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:55.065
It only brings hardship. If you're always kicking back on your parents,

336
00:23:55.245 --> 00:23:59.225
that's never going to be good for you or for them or for anyone.

337
00:24:03.135 --> 00:24:06.955
And so as long as they don't ask you to sin

338
00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:10.955
again, you're submitted to Christ above all as well.

339
00:24:11.015 --> 00:24:13.395
But as long as they don't ask you to sin and,

340
00:24:13.575 --> 00:24:17.675
and even though you might not understand why they're asking you to do this or

341
00:24:17.675 --> 00:24:20.795
saying do it this way in the Christian household,

342
00:24:21.225 --> 00:24:23.195
obedience to parents is how it works best.

343
00:24:25.265 --> 00:24:29.325
And it's a way for you as a child to model to the world around you that Christ

344
00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:30.485
has made a difference in you.

345
00:24:34.055 --> 00:24:37.245
Which is why the flip side to parents is just as important here.

346
00:24:39.665 --> 00:24:43.195
That parents under the headship of Christ, we're still under that, right?

347
00:24:43.825 --> 00:24:48.635
That they are not to provoke or discourage their

348
00:24:48.835 --> 00:24:53.625
children. That word provoke is actually what it sounds like. Exactly.

349
00:24:54.985 --> 00:24:59.905
Provoking is inciting them to anger, embitter them towards you,

350
00:25:00.775 --> 00:25:02.665
nagging over and over again on them

351
00:25:04.825 --> 00:25:07.475
sarcastically pushing your kids' buttons.

352
00:25:09.565 --> 00:25:12.825
It's provoking and it can be discouraging.

353
00:25:15.095 --> 00:25:18.435
Listen, if you don't want your kids to rebel against you as a parent,

354
00:25:18.705 --> 00:25:20.395
then stop pushing them away.

355
00:25:22.935 --> 00:25:25.305
Draw them to you, love them towards you.

356
00:25:26.925 --> 00:25:28.305
Win their heart back.

357
00:25:31.845 --> 00:25:36.805
I mean, just think of how different the Christian home would be when

358
00:25:36.805 --> 00:25:41.445
parents and children love and honor one another and

359
00:25:41.805 --> 00:25:44.565
everyone is built up in the Lord in that way. Listen,

360
00:25:44.865 --> 00:25:48.365
the new self that God's given us can do that.

361
00:25:50.685 --> 00:25:53.935
Parents can do that. Children can do that.

362
00:25:55.735 --> 00:25:58.345
Just think of the beautiful picture that gives the world.

363
00:26:01.825 --> 00:26:05.365
And finally the last section is passage deals with the difference Christ makes

364
00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:08.565
today in our work. So marriage,

365
00:26:09.035 --> 00:26:10.445
parenting work.

366
00:26:12.505 --> 00:26:16.925
Now I know Colossians talks about masters and slaves as delicate subject,

367
00:26:17.185 --> 00:26:20.725
but that was the reality in which work often happened back then.

368
00:26:20.735 --> 00:26:23.685
Maybe it was what we call indentured servanthood,

369
00:26:23.685 --> 00:26:26.645
where somebody's paying off a debt that they have towards someone where they're

370
00:26:26.645 --> 00:26:31.005
so abjectly, poverty, uh, poverty stricken, that they just have to do this.

371
00:26:31.005 --> 00:26:33.885
They kinda sell themselves into this reality. But,

372
00:26:33.985 --> 00:26:35.285
but let me be clear about this.

373
00:26:35.285 --> 00:26:40.085
When you read slavery in this context most often,

374
00:26:40.145 --> 00:26:44.205
in fact nearly all of it was not racially motivated.

375
00:26:46.795 --> 00:26:50.255
That's our, like, we kinda look back through the lens of the 18 hundreds, right?

376
00:26:50.255 --> 00:26:52.775
Like that's, that's not what we're talking about here.

377
00:26:52.845 --> 00:26:55.175
This was an economic reality back then.

378
00:26:57.615 --> 00:27:02.475
That's why we can apply it to our work environments today where there are

379
00:27:02.475 --> 00:27:06.475
similar interactions between employers and employees for economic reasons,

380
00:27:06.475 --> 00:27:10.235
right? We kind of take this today in a way that we live it out.

381
00:27:11.145 --> 00:27:15.035
It's not the same because back then a slave couldn't quit their job or do

382
00:27:15.035 --> 00:27:17.395
something else or move positions like they couldn't do that.

383
00:27:17.575 --> 00:27:19.315
So it is not exactly the same.

384
00:27:19.535 --> 00:27:24.075
But notice what it says again about how we are to work.

385
00:27:25.285 --> 00:27:28.755
Verse 22, down through chapter four. Verse one says,

386
00:27:28.825 --> 00:27:32.115
bond servants obey in everything those who are your earthly masters.

387
00:27:32.935 --> 00:27:36.755
Not by way of I service as people pleasers, but with sincerity of heart,

388
00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:38.835
fearing the Lord. Whatever you do,

389
00:27:38.985 --> 00:27:41.755
work heartily as for the Lord and not for men.

390
00:27:42.025 --> 00:27:45.675
Knowing that from the Lord you'll receive the inheritance as your reward.

391
00:27:45.815 --> 00:27:50.575
You're serving the Lord Christ for the wrong door will be paid back for the

392
00:27:50.575 --> 00:27:54.295
wrong He's done. There is no partiality masters.

393
00:27:54.425 --> 00:27:58.655
Treat your bond servant justly and fairly knowing you also have a master in

394
00:27:59.035 --> 00:28:02.215
heaven. And so again,

395
00:28:02.275 --> 00:28:06.295
slaves had very little rights back then. The master could be harsh with them,

396
00:28:06.525 --> 00:28:11.415
harmful to them. But remember, this letter was written to a church

397
00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:18.315
and the fact that Paul addressed masters and slaves in the church illustrates

398
00:28:18.315 --> 00:28:20.595
the idea I talked about before of the household, right?

399
00:28:20.625 --> 00:28:22.715
It's more than just like a nuclear family.

400
00:28:22.715 --> 00:28:25.115
There's a lot of people involved because at the time,

401
00:28:25.605 --> 00:28:30.555
whole households would come to faith at one time in many cases.

402
00:28:33.175 --> 00:28:37.515
In fact, we see it in Acts 16 with the Philippian jailer in his family.

403
00:28:38.525 --> 00:28:42.235
About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God in prison.

404
00:28:42.775 --> 00:28:45.235
And the prisoners were listening to them and suddenly there's a great

405
00:28:45.235 --> 00:28:48.715
earthquake. So the foundations of the prison were shaken immediately.

406
00:28:48.715 --> 00:28:51.075
All the doors were open, everyone's bonds were unfastened.

407
00:28:51.135 --> 00:28:53.995
And when the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors were open,

408
00:28:54.135 --> 00:28:55.955
he drew his sword was about to kill himself.

409
00:28:56.195 --> 00:28:59.875
Supposing the prisoners had escaped. But Paul cried out with a loud voice,

410
00:29:00.015 --> 00:29:03.835
do not harm yourself. We're all here. And the jailer called for lights,

411
00:29:03.855 --> 00:29:07.035
rushed in trembling with fear. He fell down before Paul and Silas.

412
00:29:07.035 --> 00:29:10.075
He brought them out and said, SIRS, what must I do to be saved?

413
00:29:10.785 --> 00:29:13.595
Like I've heard you praying and singing these things about the gospel.

414
00:29:13.945 --> 00:29:16.955
What do I do to get what you have? And they said,

415
00:29:16.985 --> 00:29:21.355
believe in the Lord Jesus and you'll be saved, you and your whole household.

416
00:29:22.695 --> 00:29:25.755
And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.

417
00:29:26.025 --> 00:29:28.635
They got together with all those people and said, here's the gospel.

418
00:29:29.415 --> 00:29:31.835
And he took them the same hour of the night, washed their wounds.

419
00:29:31.835 --> 00:29:34.555
He was baptized at once, he and all his family.

420
00:29:34.815 --> 00:29:37.315
And then he brought them up into his house, set food before them,

421
00:29:37.595 --> 00:29:42.125
rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in. God.

422
00:29:43.695 --> 00:29:47.055
Remember that was his children, extended family, servants, employee.

423
00:29:47.055 --> 00:29:48.135
Like all these people.

424
00:29:51.345 --> 00:29:56.315
That means that all of those people, including the servants, including the kids,

425
00:29:56.395 --> 00:30:00.355
would've been a part of the Colossian church, right?

426
00:30:03.855 --> 00:30:08.185
Because as we saw in Colossians three 11 in Christ, they're now all equal.

427
00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:13.185
No more slave and freed Greek and Jews, circumcised, uncircumcised. No,

428
00:30:13.355 --> 00:30:15.185
we're one in Christ.

429
00:30:15.245 --> 00:30:18.825
But remember that didn't necessarily change their roles in life.

430
00:30:21.595 --> 00:30:25.545
Maybe they did free some slave, but, but that's,

431
00:30:25.545 --> 00:30:28.825
that's why Paul talked here the way they should interact in the new creation

432
00:30:28.825 --> 00:30:29.658
kingdom.

433
00:30:29.765 --> 00:30:34.425
Now how do you handle those relationships you have in the household?

434
00:30:36.595 --> 00:30:38.175
And so for us, first for the employee,

435
00:30:38.175 --> 00:30:40.135
that's our modern language we use for that. Of course,

436
00:30:41.155 --> 00:30:44.855
you ought to willingly follow the employer you have.

437
00:30:46.605 --> 00:30:49.335
Doesn't mean you can't change jobs, but, but ultimately,

438
00:30:49.655 --> 00:30:52.655
remember you're not working for that employer anyway.

439
00:30:53.815 --> 00:30:56.625
They're paying you of course, but but what did it say?

440
00:30:57.925 --> 00:31:00.425
You are serving the Lord Christ.

441
00:31:00.865 --> 00:31:03.285
Remember you're working for God,

442
00:31:04.415 --> 00:31:07.155
not just me or the people getting paid by the church. We don't, yeah,

443
00:31:07.155 --> 00:31:09.035
we work for God in a sense, but but you do too.

444
00:31:09.175 --> 00:31:13.275
You are serving the Lord Christ and he's the one who blesses eternally.

445
00:31:13.365 --> 00:31:15.395
Think about how a slave would've heard that,

446
00:31:16.595 --> 00:31:21.325
that God gives the inheritance because a slave had no possibility of

447
00:31:21.445 --> 00:31:25.245
an inheritance. But Paul says, no,

448
00:31:25.485 --> 00:31:29.605
actually you're gonna get rewarded. The inheritance to come is the eternal one.

449
00:31:29.625 --> 00:31:32.045
You're gonna get that. So stay faithful.

450
00:31:36.225 --> 00:31:40.005
But also they should be encouraged because he is the one who justly,

451
00:31:40.245 --> 00:31:41.525
repays those who are doing wrong.

452
00:31:41.785 --> 00:31:44.885
So the slaves getting mistreated or had been or before and he's,

453
00:31:45.075 --> 00:31:47.605
he's saying to them, no, you don't have to try to take vengeance.

454
00:31:47.675 --> 00:31:52.245
It's God's who's going to repay shows. No partiality.

455
00:31:52.705 --> 00:31:55.885
It doesn't matter the order of the way things work out in creation.

456
00:31:56.255 --> 00:31:58.725
God's got it. So if you're working for the Lord first,

457
00:31:59.825 --> 00:32:03.325
if you go to work tomorrow or this afternoon or whenever you go to work,

458
00:32:03.425 --> 00:32:07.725
you go working for the Lord. That's why you should work hard.

459
00:32:09.105 --> 00:32:12.005
That's the word heartily means from the deepest part of who you are,

460
00:32:12.545 --> 00:32:15.805
not just notice we said it, not just when your boss is watching,

461
00:32:17.265 --> 00:32:21.995
Ooh man, that's gonna get us right work hardily,

462
00:32:22.135 --> 00:32:25.315
not as people pleasers a way of I service. He says, no.

463
00:32:25.315 --> 00:32:27.315
Instead you ought to fear the Lord

464
00:32:29.105 --> 00:32:32.035
that when you put eight hours on your time sheet, but you only worked five,

465
00:32:33.175 --> 00:32:34.008
he sees that

466
00:32:37.305 --> 00:32:38.955
when you steal money or swipe a little,

467
00:32:38.965 --> 00:32:42.085
a little bit here and there from the company or or take advantage of some

468
00:32:42.765 --> 00:32:46.205
policies. That's just a little bit of an ethical nuance. No, he sees that

469
00:32:49.535 --> 00:32:52.825
When you take advantage of your salaried position to come in late and leave

470
00:32:52.825 --> 00:32:55.585
early because you've got enough done, he sees that

471
00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:03.665
even students might not have a job, but your employer,

472
00:33:03.885 --> 00:33:07.505
so to speak, would be those that you're working for at school. Teachers,

473
00:33:07.695 --> 00:33:11.665
leaders in that way. Are you giving your best?

474
00:33:12.445 --> 00:33:15.545
Are you working for the Lord first in school,

475
00:33:20.495 --> 00:33:24.155
stay at home parents. Okay, you don't have a,

476
00:33:24.475 --> 00:33:28.315
a job that pays. You think, this doesn't apply to me at all. No, actually,

477
00:33:28.315 --> 00:33:31.315
listen, you have an incredibly hard job as well,

478
00:33:32.815 --> 00:33:37.615
and the work that you put in often is never ever seen by

479
00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:41.375
anybody else. So you are working for the Lord.

480
00:33:42.965 --> 00:33:44.225
So do it. Well work hard.

481
00:33:47.165 --> 00:33:51.705
But you see how different a picture that would have showed the world around them

482
00:33:52.095 --> 00:33:53.105
back then, right?

483
00:33:56.095 --> 00:33:59.995
It can be the same way today that if you are working like this,

484
00:34:00.135 --> 00:34:02.795
you could be the best employee they have

485
00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:08.835
because God's made you a new creation and you've put on the new self.

486
00:34:12.335 --> 00:34:16.075
But you notice this passage speaks to the employer as well, right?

487
00:34:18.155 --> 00:34:20.385
Where back then, instead of using their slaves,

488
00:34:20.385 --> 00:34:24.985
masters were to treat them justly and fairly. They were to bless them,

489
00:34:25.175 --> 00:34:29.305
they were to treat them like brothers and sisters in Christ as they were.

490
00:34:32.015 --> 00:34:35.915
It didn't negate the level of authority the relationship demanded,

491
00:34:35.935 --> 00:34:40.935
but it changed the way it worked out. Same way today,

492
00:34:41.235 --> 00:34:44.295
if you're a supervisor of anyone in any level,

493
00:34:46.315 --> 00:34:47.148
listen,

494
00:34:48.395 --> 00:34:53.205
nothing in your position gives you the right to be unjust,

495
00:34:53.625 --> 00:34:56.525
to be unfair, to be harsh, to be whatever.

496
00:34:59.595 --> 00:34:59.835
I mean,

497
00:34:59.835 --> 00:35:03.915
just think about the atmosphere you would create when your policies are fair,

498
00:35:05.285 --> 00:35:07.335
when you are paying your people well,

499
00:35:07.565 --> 00:35:12.305
when you're treating your employees with kindness, when you're humble,

500
00:35:12.575 --> 00:35:15.945
when you're repentant, when you have that kind of atmosphere, man,

501
00:35:15.945 --> 00:35:20.455
that screams grace all over it, doesn't it? And people want to be there.

502
00:35:20.485 --> 00:35:22.975
They long to work in that way.

503
00:35:26.755 --> 00:35:30.155
'cause notice where Paul based that command in, in chapter four verse one,

504
00:35:30.155 --> 00:35:35.155
he says, do this masters knowing that you also have a master

505
00:35:35.735 --> 00:35:39.445
in heaven. He said, Hey master, don't forget you're a slave to,

506
00:35:40.975 --> 00:35:45.195
you're a slave to Christ as well. And so you have a submission to him.

507
00:35:45.385 --> 00:35:48.035
That goes us right back to the foundational points today.

508
00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:50.955
That if Christ is Lord over the household,

509
00:35:51.255 --> 00:35:53.995
if Christ is head within the household,

510
00:35:54.105 --> 00:35:57.515
that changes everything about the way we interact.

511
00:35:59.125 --> 00:36:01.945
He calls the shots and he gives the example.

512
00:36:02.405 --> 00:36:07.305
The closest relationships in our lives have the opportunity to show

513
00:36:07.615 --> 00:36:11.705
more than any other way the transformation that Christ brings in our lives.

514
00:36:14.965 --> 00:36:19.175
When our marriages and our parenting and our workplaces are different,

515
00:36:19.555 --> 00:36:22.655
it shows that Christ has truly made a difference.

516
00:36:22.895 --> 00:36:25.815
'cause those people know you better than anyone else does.

517
00:36:28.505 --> 00:36:30.925
My wife knows me better than anyone else.

518
00:36:31.265 --> 00:36:36.245
And so I have every responsibility to treat her in a way that if she

519
00:36:36.535 --> 00:36:37.368
still loves,

520
00:36:37.465 --> 00:36:41.885
if she still comes to and cares for and serves and works together with me,

521
00:36:42.235 --> 00:36:43.485
that shows the world

522
00:36:45.815 --> 00:36:49.425
that there's true love and transformed love in that

523
00:36:52.975 --> 00:36:54.745
they can be the best way to show the world,

524
00:36:55.125 --> 00:37:00.105
or they can be the biggest detractor from the glory of

525
00:37:00.245 --> 00:37:03.905
God. As we live out these relationships, no different than the way of the world.

526
00:37:06.225 --> 00:37:08.365
If our marriages look just like the rest of the world,

527
00:37:08.425 --> 00:37:11.045
if our parenting ways look just like the rest of the world,

528
00:37:11.065 --> 00:37:14.765
if our workplaces look just like the world around us, there's no difference.

529
00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:17.645
And it actually pulls down the glory of God.

530
00:37:21.065 --> 00:37:22.945
So hear me, church, we have to be different.

531
00:37:26.325 --> 00:37:29.985
If we claim to be new creations through the life, death,

532
00:37:29.985 --> 00:37:33.505
and resurrection of Jesus Christ, that we have placed our faith in him.

533
00:37:33.855 --> 00:37:38.545
That new self we put on, looks like this in our relationships.

534
00:37:43.305 --> 00:37:47.655
Colossians three 17, we ended with this last week. Whatever you do

535
00:37:51.205 --> 00:37:52.505
in word or deeded,

536
00:37:53.205 --> 00:37:57.215
do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,

537
00:37:57.595 --> 00:38:02.125
giving thanks to God the Father through Him. Everything,

538
00:38:02.805 --> 00:38:04.125
whatever you do. So

539
00:38:05.795 --> 00:38:07.855
be single to the glory of God.

540
00:38:10.095 --> 00:38:12.275
Be married to the glory of God,

541
00:38:14.585 --> 00:38:19.125
parent to the glory of God. Work to the glory of God,

542
00:38:19.585 --> 00:38:22.525
all because you have a new name that's over you.

543
00:38:24.455 --> 00:38:25.505
It's the name of Christ.

544
00:38:26.725 --> 00:38:29.585
You're doing it in His name and for His name.

545
00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:36.375
Whatever you do in everything in everything,

546
00:38:36.915 --> 00:38:38.975
do it in the name of the Lord Jesus.
