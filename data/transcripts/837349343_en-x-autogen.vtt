1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.130
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.810
I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.610
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.930
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.210
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.450
Good morning, church. It is such a pleasure and joy to be with you guys here,

7
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.450
uh, this morning. Uh, first, uh, I am Brandon. Uh,

8
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.250
I serve here as a boys ministry associate and so I get to hang out with the

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.050
students and I am a little biased,

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.770
but I do feel like I have the best job in the world. Um,

11
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.050
so shout out to students for letting me stick around as long as I have.

12
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.050
I'm very appreciative of you all, uh, and all the students out there. Uh,

13
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.250
today we'll be in Psalm 57. So if you have your Bible,

14
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.050
please turn there with me. Should be right in the middle of your Bible,

15
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.850
right in between, uh, the Book of Job and the book of Proverbs.

16
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.650
And as you're turning there, I wanted to give a couple of thank yous.

17
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.410
Uh, first I wanted to give you a thank you for all of your prayer. Uh,

18
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.290
last time I was here back in November,

19
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.210
I was in the midst of my finals week of seminary and

20
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.810
the final was the next day.

21
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.050
And I came before you all and asked for prayer and you know, it worked.

22
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.810
I was able to finish everything, uh, finish this semester out well.

23
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.890
And so next time I'm in a crunch,

24
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.330
I'll make sure I get on the preaching calendar and come back up here and tell

25
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.090
you guys about it. So thank you honestly for your prayers. The second thank you,

26
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.370
uh, I want to give is through just you guys as a church for the encouragement,

27
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.370
um, that, that you guys have given me as I've seen you and,

28
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.690
and the church and through email and text, uh, it has been, um,

29
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.890
a true blessing for me, um, to hear those kind words. And third,

30
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.610
I wanted to give a thank you to a group of people who I met with beforehand.

31
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.330
As I was prepping this psalm,

32
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.370
I just wanted to get more eyes on the text and I just wanted to see what the

33
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.290
Lord was revealing in their heart as they read it.

34
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.610
And so thank you for helping me put more eyes on the text. And,

35
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.690
and last but not least, I want to give a thank you to John. I know, know,

36
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.170
he is not here, but I want to just be thankful for the opportunity, uh,

37
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.810
to be up here. But I have to confess,

38
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.650
when I saw that I was preaching Psalm 57, I was not thrilled.

39
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.410
Um, I wasn't frustrated, but I was a little like, oh man, Psalm 57.

40
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.090
But there's a reason I'm not against Psalm 57,

41
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.770
but the last time I preached it was over Psalm 52.

42
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.650
And in Psalm 52, I look at these situations.

43
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.450
I I look at David's life, I see what he's going through,

44
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.130
and it doesn't come from a joyful or cheerful

45
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.610
circumstance. When I look at Psalm 57 and Psalm 52,

46
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.410
they actually come from pretty much the same situation in David's life.

47
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.660
He's on the run, Saul is hunting him.

48
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.540
When I look at Psalm 57,

49
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.340
I see that they come from a heart that is going through it.

50
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.820
The Psalm arises from a heart that is exhausted,

51
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.960
a heart that is only standing up by leaning on the everlasting arms.

52
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.410
And you know, selfishly,

53
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.370
I would love to preach a psalm where David just got done conquering enemies and

54
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.930
he is riding again on cloud nine or or Psalm 23,

55
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.210
any, anything, the psalms that we, that we grew up with and we love to recite.

56
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.710
But the more I've looked at it in red,

57
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.710
Psalm 57 and I see these storms of destruction which

58
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.750
come at a great time after last night, I,

59
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.190
I start to see that this is real life.

60
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.470
What David is going through is real.

61
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.830
And we need to talk about where God is during the midst of storms

62
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.950
because life is hard

63
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.470
and sometimes things happen that are completely out of our control.

64
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.750
But don't hear me say that life is one big storm and we should walk around like

65
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.510
EO and and just all walk around listening to Nirvana music,

66
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.910
that there are so many joyful seasons in life, but there are storms.

67
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.300
There are times when we feel beat up like the enemy is

68
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.500
simply eating our lunch, for example.

69
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.500
Maybe finances are strained right now and you can't imagine how you're

70
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.333
gonna make it through.

71
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.860
Or maybe you're dealing with loss in the family or you're preparing for a loss

72
00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.713
to come.

73
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.540
There could be sin in your life that you are fighting to overcome,

74
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.380
but you keep falling back and you just feel the weight.

75
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.750
And for some of us in this room today, father's day is a storm.

76
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.230
This is a hard day for people. It can be a hard day for multiple reasons,

77
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.670
but honestly, maybe it has nothing to do with your earthly father, father,

78
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.270
but maybe you feel like your heavenly Father has abandoned you.

79
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.010
Maybe you feel like you are left on your own

80
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.850
at the end of your line and you're giving God one more chance to show up.

81
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.850
This is real life. And as for me,

82
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.010
as I've looked over this psalm, it's been a breath of fresh air.

83
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.610
Here's why.

84
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.580
Because this psalm can fully acknowledge that there are storms in our life.

85
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.780
There are attacks and fears all around us.

86
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.700
When David is writing this psalm, he's on the move to the cave.

87
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.580
And we can see what David saw in one Samuel 22, 1 through two.

88
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.060
It says this,

89
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.980
and David departed from there and it escaped to the cave of Al Adom.

90
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.860
And when his brothers and all his father's house heard it,

91
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.020
they went down there to him and everyone who was in distress,

92
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.180
everyone who was in debt,

93
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.540
and everyone who was bitter in soul gathered to him and he

94
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.420
became commander over them and they were with him about 400 men.

95
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.620
David was surrounded by people who needed encouragement and to be

96
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.380
reminded that the God who is most high is still most high,

97
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.180
David a knows around him,

98
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.580
needed to see that God's faithfulness abounds and it far exceeded their

99
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.060
comprehension so they could trust him.

100
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.060
We did the same thing this morning and so read with me Psalm 57 and let's see

101
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.340
what the Lord has for us today.

102
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.200
Be merciful to me. Oh God, be merciful to me.

103
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.830
For in you my soul takes refuge in the shadow of your wings,

104
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.950
I will take refuge till the storms of destruction pass

105
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.963
by.

106
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.270
I cry out to God most time to God who fulfills his purpose for me.

107
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.230
He will send from heaven and save me.

108
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.190
He will put the shame him who tramples on me.

109
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.830
God will send out his steadfast love and faithfulness.

110
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.710
My soul is in the midst of lions. I lie down amid fiery beasts,

111
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.590
the children of man whose teeth are spears and arrows,

112
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.390
whose tongues are sharp swords, but be exalted. Oh God, above the heavens.

113
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.230
Let your glory be over all the earth. They set a net for my steps.

114
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.830
My soul was bowed down, they dug a pit in my way,

115
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.910
but they have fallen into it themselves.

116
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.490
My heart is steadfast. Oh God, my heart is steadfast.

117
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:18.410
I will sing and makem melody awake my glory, Waco harpin liar.

118
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.930
I will awake the dawn. I will give thanks to you, oh Lord,

119
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:24.770
among the peoples.

120
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:29.490
I will sing praises to you among the nations for your steadfast love.

121
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.250
It's great to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds. Be exalted. Oh God,

122
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.770
above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth. Let's pray. Lord,

123
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.610
thank you for this time.

124
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.770
God thank you that we can come and worship you together. Lord,

125
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.490
I simply pray that you help us see you more clearly. Your name we pray. Amen.

126
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.810
So where do we find ourselves in Psalm 57? Well, like Phil mentioned last week,

127
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.300
Psalm 56 through 60 were all midterms and they all have to

128
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.740
do with David being under pressure,

129
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.820
under attack and needing deliverance.

130
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.820
And in 57 we see that David was on the run for his life against the current

131
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.300
king who commands all of these armies

132
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.820
and he's dedicated to killing David. David simply out of jealousy.

133
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.100
And the only reason he wants to kill David is because the Lord has anointed

134
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.740
David King and he has rejected Saul.

135
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.060
And I'm sure thoughts may have crossed David's mind like, okay, God,

136
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.220
why would you even put me in this situation if you knew God,

137
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.980
if you knew Saul was gonna come after and chase me,

138
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.900
Maybe David was just fine doing a safe job as a shepherd.

139
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.620
But also we know in the Bible that when David was a shepherd,

140
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.780
he would always fight off lions and bears when they took a sheep.

141
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.260
So maybe David was just built for this moment,

142
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.980
but now he finds himself on the run

143
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.730
being chased by the king and his men and

144
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.800
he's hiding in a cave. It's dark,

145
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.330
it's cold. David is far from home.

146
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.330
But at the same time, on the outside looking in,

147
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:23.010
we can see that David is in a cave. He's safe in a way.

148
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.850
They have a home base, they have somewhere to run.

149
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.570
But David knows the cave that he's in this physical cave is not his refuge.

150
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.130
Well, how do we see that? Look again, verses one and two with me,

151
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.530
he pleads to God and says, be merciful to me for in you my soul takes refuge.

152
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.210
David knows this is not a game of hide and seek.

153
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.730
David feels this in his soul and knows that a mere physical cave will

154
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.563
not protect him.

155
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:58.090
David is looking to get under the shadow of the Lord's wings and hide

156
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.530
himself. He is crying out to God to deliver him and to save him.

157
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.650
And so if David was finding his refuge and protection from this cave,

158
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.850
then why would he come before the Lord?

159
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.410
David knows the cave is not his refuge because

160
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.770
God is his refuge.

161
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.250
God is his refuge.

162
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.490
How about us? When times get hard,

163
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.610
when you're frustrated, when you're tired, where do you find your refuge?

164
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.770
Where do you put your trust in a refuge?

165
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.450
Simply put is a condition of being safe

166
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.410
or sheltered from the pursuit of danger.

167
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.890
And so when I ask that question, when you feel like you are being attacked

168
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.700
or under pressure or you're filled with fear,

169
00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.460
where do you turn for safety?

170
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.220
What do you think will give you the rest and relief that you are longing for?

171
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.460
And as I've looked at this text and had the rest with this,

172
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.900
I've had to be honest with myself and say that I often turn to everything

173
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.393
but God,

174
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.150
I try and find safety in the things on this earth and not the God of the

175
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.950
universe. For example,

176
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.310
food can be a refuge and a very tasty,

177
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.150
delicious refuge.

178
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:37.590
And I know of many fathers who are will be partaking in a lot of food after

179
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.870
we're done here And food is good, don't get me wrong.

180
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:45.430
But food does not sustain us maybe for a little bit.

181
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.270
But what we don't find in this psalm is David's stress eating his problems away.

182
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.030
David knows the cave is not his refuge.

183
00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.550
He knows nothing on this earth can protect him and bring him true rest outside

184
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:02.563
of God.

185
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.270
Or maybe there's something in our life that we seek security and safety and

186
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.990
there's actually sin against God.

187
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.550
We think that we know better than God. And if we do this,

188
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:20.270
then we will be satisfied and all of our fears and worries will be gone.

189
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.810
And as someone who has done this time and time again,

190
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.210
I can promise you that our sin does not make a good refuge.

191
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.810
And what we need to know and what can encourage us today is what David saw.

192
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:40.170
He saw God as his refuge and David was determined to

193
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:43.650
hide himself in the shadow of the Lord's wings.

194
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.330
He knew the situation was out of his control,

195
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.010
but he knew his God had control

196
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.890
and David wasn't the only one.

197
00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:00.050
We can see all the way back in Genesis with this guy named Joseph who

198
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.250
continued to trust in the Lord and find refuge in him even when his brothers

199
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.930
wanted to kill him. And then I guess they settled to just sell him into slavery

200
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.370
And he still hid himself in the Lord. When he did the right thing,

201
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.610
he made the right decision.

202
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.290
But he still gets sent to prison for something he didn't even do.

203
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.370
And when he had helped someone get out of prison to interpret dreams,

204
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.930
it seemed like that there was this light at the end of the tunnel,

205
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.080
but yet he had to keep waiting and waiting. But through it all,

206
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.360
he continued to trust in the Lord and seek refuge in him.

207
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.920
And then if we go to the New Testament, we see Jesus as he's fasting,

208
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.720
he continues to trust in the Lord as well.

209
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.340
So how do we get there in the face of danger

210
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:56.430
when we're tired in the face of persecution, when we're hurting,

211
00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.950
how can we turn to God to protect us? Well,

212
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.430
if we take notes from this psalm,

213
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.350
we can see that through this imagery that David wants the people to see that God

214
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:08.830
is most high,

215
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.200
God is most high. Where do we see it?

216
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.240
I'm so glad you asked. Look at verse two with me.

217
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.680
He directly calls God most high. He says, I cry out to God most high,

218
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.800
Which is a name for God.

219
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.440
We first see in Genesis when Abraham says that I have lifted up my hand

220
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:31.880
to the Lord God,

221
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.240
most high possessor of heaven and earth,

222
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.760
there is nothing higher than God.

223
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.120
Any rules over it all.

224
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:49.520
David wants to take refuge into one who holds heaven and earth in his hands.

225
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.960
Because what threat can compare

226
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.460
since God is most high,

227
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:01.300
then we can see the confidence that David has as he says in verse three,

228
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.900
that God will send and save him.

229
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.620
God will put to shame thoses who trample over him.

230
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.820
God will send out his love because God is most high.

231
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.260
And if David was unsure about any of this,

232
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.340
then he would've ran somewhere else for protection.

233
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.820
But he understood that the God he worshiped was the one who was over it

234
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.740
all. David understood that if the Lord had a purpose,

235
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.980
then he would fulfill it. And there was nothing,

236
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.580
no one or anything on earth that could stop that.

237
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.260
And later in the Bible and the book of Isaiah,

238
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.900
God gives us a glimpse into his majestic character. And Isaiah, oh boy,

239
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:49.220
46, 8 through 11, we see this. This is God speaking.

240
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.340
Remember this and stand firm,

241
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.500
recall it to mine you transgressors.

242
00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:01.540
Remember the former things of old for I am God and there is

243
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.900
no other. I am God.

244
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.780
And there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient

245
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.540
times things not yet done saying my counsel shall stand

246
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.860
in. I will accomplish all my purpose. Calling a bird of from the east,

247
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.740
the man of my council, from afar country,

248
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.580
I have spoken and I will bring it to pass.

249
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.100
I have purpose and I will do it.

250
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.900
What a big and mighty God we serve.

251
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.990
Do we see him like that? And you see,

252
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:45.670
if we go back to David's early life when he's face to face with a literal giant

253
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.340
names Goliath, here's what he says. Up they go back and forth, forth.

254
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.780
And first Samuel then David said to the Philistine,

255
00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.780
you come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin,

256
00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.740
but I come to you and the name of the Lord of host,

257
00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.420
the God of the armies of Israel,

258
00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.820
whom you have defied this day,

259
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.820
the Lord will deliver you into my hands and I will strike you down and cut off

260
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.280
your head.

261
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.980
And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the

262
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.260
birds of the air, to the wild beasts of the earth. Don't worry,

263
00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.380
we don't say that part in the hillside kids version,

264
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.580
That all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel and that all

265
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:39.540
this assembly may know that the Lord saves not with sword and spear for

266
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.620
the battle is the Lord's and he will give you and to our hands.

267
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.130
Do we walk around with that same confidence when it comes to God?

268
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.490
Like I said, the reason I believe David could run to God as his refuge

269
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.810
is because he saw how big God was.

270
00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:01.450
He saw that God was most high.

271
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.490
David grew up hearing the stories about how God's power at the Red Sea,

272
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.720
David grew up hearing about how God was able to send manna down from heaven.

273
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.050
David grew up hearing about these conquests where it looked like Israel was

274
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.610
gonna lose. They were clearly outnumbered,

275
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.090
but God showed up big

276
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:29.410
so David was able to take refuge and the God who was most high because nothing

277
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.770
was bigger than God.

278
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.530
And if David was alive after the year 1885,

279
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.330
then I'm sure he would join all of the saints and sing,

280
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.490
oh Lord my God,

281
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.050
when I in awesome wonder,

282
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.290
consider all the worlds thy hands have made.

283
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:58.490
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder. Dear

284
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.290
Thy power throughout display

285
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.530
then sings my soul,

286
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.970
my savior God to thee how great thou art,

287
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:12.890
how great thou art.

288
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:19.010
If you have put your faith in Jesus and call yourself a Christian,

289
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.010
then we need to fight against having small views of who God is.

290
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.490
Why would we run and put our trust in a God we're unsure,

291
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.770
has the power to show up? So let me ask you the question,

292
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.490
what is going on in your life where you need God to show up

293
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.190
as you're thinking about it? Do you think that's too big for God?

294
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.030
Do you think these situations are outside of his control?

295
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:59.150
Does the pressure weigh on you and the fear weigh on you so hard that you simply

296
00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.430
need relief and you don't care where it comes from?

297
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.990
Can you relate to David in verse four when he says,

298
00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:10.670
his soul is in the midst of lions and when he lies down,

299
00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.950
he's among the beast. And when he looks around,

300
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.590
he sees the children of man have teeth that are arrows that are waiting to

301
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:22.240
penetrate his soul. That is you today.

302
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.480
If you have felt this way before,

303
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.200
our hope is found in God who is most high, the God who saves

304
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.600
And nothing else can deliver you because nothing else has the power or authority

305
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.760
to. So like David and many of our other heroes in the faith have done and our

306
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.753
ultimate hero,

307
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:47.280
Jesus Christ take refuge in the Lord who is possessor of heaven

308
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.560
and earth. But in this psalm,

309
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.480
we see more than just God's power and majesty on display.

310
00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.360
We can see his faithfulness.

311
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:04.080
We can trust God as a refuge because God is faithful.

312
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.880
It was one thing for David to see how powerful God was,

313
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.800
but he also needed to see that God was faithful.

314
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.240
So growing up in Oklahoma and traveling anywhere in the world and telling

315
00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.480
someone you're from Oklahoma, they always have one question they ask you.

316
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.800
It's always the first. I promise o U or osu,

317
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.240
that's all anyone cares about when it comes to our great state.

318
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.720
And I'm not here to pick a fight at all. I'm not gonna answer that question,

319
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.920
but I will say this,

320
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.200
I've always had a hard time watching college football and enjoying college

321
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.400
football. Uh, for the sole reason that um,

322
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:46.680
they all leave. Uh, obviously no one can play for a team forever,

323
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.960
but with college it felt so short lived. Like one second they're here.

324
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.480
Maybe they win Heisman,

325
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.760
maybe they win you a conference championship and you blank and they're gone.

326
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.680
They're off in the N F L,

327
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.360
they're off playing for another team across the country and you're lucky to

328
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.000
catch 'em on Sundays.

329
00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:11.120
And we're so proud and excited for their next step. But it still hurts a little.

330
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.600
Um, you started the roof for someone, you're following them,

331
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.720
you love them and they're gone.

332
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.490
And then you have to get emotionally attached to the next great player,

333
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.250
however long that may take. And you see,

334
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.690
God is not a one and done prospect.

335
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.840
God is not waiting for the next best opportunity to come,

336
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.760
but he's faithful through generations.

337
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.680
And this sounds familiar to Exodus 34, 6,

338
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.260
the Lord, the Lord of God,

339
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.660
merciful and gracious flow to anger and abounding

340
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.340
in steadfast love and faithfulness,

341
00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:58.300
keeping steadfast love to thousands from generation

342
00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.820
to generation. God is faithful to his people.

343
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.460
Mourning by mourning mercies we see great is thy

344
00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.373
faithfulness.

345
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.030
David saw that not only was God powerful enough to be his refuge,

346
00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.670
but he saw that he was the faithful refuge.

347
00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.070
Look at the text again with me in Psalm 57, 3

348
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.923
he says,

349
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:32.190
and he sees the utmost confidence that the Lord will send out his steadfast

350
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:36.110
love and faithfulness. And if we drop down to verse six,

351
00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.150
he sees that they have dug a pit for me,

352
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.390
but they have fallen into it themselves.

353
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.910
And then jumping to verse 10,

354
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.910
we see that God's faithfulness and love is great to the heavens

355
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.390
and far exceeds our comprehension. It is above the clouds.

356
00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.230
And if we look at verse three and 10,

357
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.990
we can see the word in our English translation. It says steadfast love.

358
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.830
But when we translate it back to Hebrew, we can see that that word is Hess said,

359
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.750
hopefully I'm saying that right, Phil can correct me later.

360
00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:15.710
But this word is a word that is used about 250 times in the Old Testament.

361
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.390
And it is a number one, uh,

362
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.030
number one word that God uses to describe himself.

363
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.620
God shows his abounding unfailing love or has said to his

364
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.453
people,

365
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.500
listen to the description of God's faithfulness has said surpasses

366
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.700
ordinary kindness and friendship.

367
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.640
It is the inclination of the heart to show amazing grace to the one who is

368
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.400
loved. It runs deeper than social expectations,

369
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.080
responsibilities and emotions or what is deserved or earned by the recipient.

370
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:57.640
And it finds its home and committed familial love and it comes to life

371
00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.893
and actions.

372
00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:03.400
There is no other refuge that can be as faithful as our God.

373
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.360
Throughout all of the circumstances in David's life,

374
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.800
he was able to see that God will not leave his side.

375
00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.080
David was able to trust in the almighty power of God,

376
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.560
but also God's nearness and God's love and God's mercy.

377
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.600
He shows the sinful people.

378
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:29.790
So if we look for rest and security and safety and tr trust outside of God,

379
00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.590
then we will be satisfied.

380
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.390
Every other refuge we run to only be

381
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.330
unreliable. So lemme ask you the question,

382
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:45.940
where do you run for refuge?

383
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:52.500
Do you run to the almighty faithful God who has made himself our refuge through

384
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.500
the storms of destruction?

385
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.340
Or do you run to a false refuge?

386
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.060
Do you run to a place that promises,

387
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.260
promises you rest but can never fulfill you?

388
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.220
And maybe you're sitting in this room today and you can't even wrap your head

389
00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.380
around the fact that we could run to the God of the universe to seek safety and

390
00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.020
protection and trust.

391
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:24.180
Like why in the world would God want me to run to him? Well,

392
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.020
we see David doesn't appeal to God based off his own merits.

393
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.580
God is not David's refuge because David's some standup guy.

394
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.060
Look again at the first verse in Psalm 57. David says,

395
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.300
be merciful to me. I need your mercy.

396
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.180
And if we go back to last week's Psalm and 56 1, it says,

397
00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.500
be gracious to me God.

398
00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:54.010
David is asking for the Lord's grace. So why do I say all this?

399
00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:58.890
Because if you are in this room and you are at the end of your rope and

400
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.810
everything else has failed you,

401
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:08.690
you can run to the Lord for your refuge and you can hide under the shadow

402
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:10.170
of his wings.

403
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.370
And you don't need to feel like you need to clean yourself up or get yourself

404
00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:16.203
right.

405
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.423
You

406
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.740
God is our refuge because of his great mercy and love for us.

407
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.460
How great is that?

408
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.180
We have the faithful refuge in God,

409
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.980
the Father based solely on mercy and grace.

410
00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:38.460
Mercy and grace that we all need today ends every day

411
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.220
because time and time again we forget God.

412
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.060
And we wouldn't say that we just God like he's gone from our memory,

413
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.580
but we maybe we have an inaccurate view of who God is.

414
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.220
And so we don't trust him and we don't make him our refuge

415
00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.700
and he isn't our help in the midst of storms when people are

416
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.580
surrounding us and they have these nets set up for us to fall in.

417
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.140
Our heart isn't always on the Lord,

418
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.970
that as I read through this text,

419
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.350
the someone who is still praising God

420
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.080
even while being attacked.

421
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:25.800
When I read through this text and I see someone giving thanks to the Lord in

422
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.840
singing, I see someone trusting in the Lord fully.

423
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.370
I'm reminded of Jesus Christ.

424
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:39.970
His heart was always set on God and he never found refuge

425
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.380
anywhere else but in God the Father.

426
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.580
And so what Jesus did here on earth makes it possible for us to make God our

427
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:53.460
refuge today even though we have turned away from God time and time

428
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.460
again. Jesus never did.

429
00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.930
Jesus always made God the Father his refuge.

430
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.170
And so if you have put your faith in Jesus,

431
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:09.610
you can run to God as your refuge because of what Jesus did. And if you haven't,

432
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:12.930
you are invited to today.

433
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:18.130
And my prayer is that God would help you see him more clearly and you could

434
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.210
trust him as your refuge.

435
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:28.410
But there's one more point for believers in the room,

436
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.210
those who have trusted in Jesus.

437
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:32.530
There's

438
00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.490
One more thing we need to see.

439
00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:39.370
While the context of this psalm may come at a not so great situation,

440
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.210
David's on the run for his life. He's scared.

441
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.370
He doesn't know what's gonna happen.

442
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.530
David doesn't stay there and neither should we.

443
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.130
And so whatever you walked in here with, however this weekend went,

444
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.250
however June has gone for you,

445
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.520
I don't think we should stay in this, this storm,

446
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:05.040
but we should move to praising God. Look at verses five and 11 with me.

447
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:11.920
Even through everything that is going on, the Psalm breaks in verse five,

448
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.160
look, it says, be exalted. Oh God, above the heavens.

449
00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.600
Let your glory be over all the earth.

450
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.840
This is as his soul is in the midst of lions.

451
00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.920
And then in the end at verse at verse 11, he finishes, finishes it saying,

452
00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.360
be exalted. Oh God,

453
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:35.920
above the heavens that should glory be over all the earth.

454
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:37.423
Same line.

455
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:44.440
David breaks in the middle despite his circumstances and praises God.

456
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.040
So what I believe David wanted to communicate to the people and the listeners is

457
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.680
that we should praise God even in the storms,

458
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:58.640
David was so sure of the Lord's protection and deliverance,

459
00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.040
that he was moved to sing and to dance and praise the name of the Lord.

460
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:09.720
So what we should do today is we should join David by praising God.

461
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.200
Join David by praising God.

462
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.440
Well why was David praising God and why should we?

463
00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:19.960
Well the answer is because a better day is coming.

464
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.880
David trusted in the Lord and knew that it would work out,

465
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.480
but he never saw Jesus. And being on this side of history,

466
00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.040
we know that we will not need to take refuge forever.

467
00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.440
The gospel tells us there is a life after this one.

468
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.300
The gospel tells us that Jesus will come back.

469
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.740
And that is why we should praise God,

470
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:50.060
because Jesus will reign on the throne forever and make everything

471
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:54.460
right. Jesus will turn our mourning to dancing.

472
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.020
And like David says in verse three, and since we're on this side of history,

473
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:04.060
we know that Jesus will sin from heaven and save me.

474
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.500
Jesus will put the shame him who tramples over me.

475
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:13.580
Jesus will be faithful. So while yes,

476
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.380
we take refuge in the Lord today

477
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.900
and we can trust him because he is most high and he is faithful.

478
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.220
One day there will be no more storms.

479
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.310
There will be no more destruction.

480
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:33.980
This is how the story ends in Revelation 21, verse one through eight.

481
00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.820
Mrs. John speaking. He says,

482
00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.060
then I saw a new heaven and a new earth

483
00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.500
for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no

484
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.280
more. And I saw the holy city,

485
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:58.320
new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God prepared as a bride

486
00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:02.680
adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,

487
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.120
behold the dwelling place of God is with man.

488
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.840
He will dwell with them and they will be his people

489
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.410
and God himself will be with them as their God.

490
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:21.210
And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes. And death shall be no more.

491
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.370
Neither shall I be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore.

492
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.930
For the former things have passed away.

493
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:33.450
And he who was seated on the throne said, behold,

494
00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:38.130
I am making all things new. Also, he said,

495
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:42.970
write this down for these words are trustworthy and true. And he said to me,

496
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:47.010
it is done. I am the alpha and the omega,

497
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.530
the beginning and the end to the thirsty.

498
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:54.530
I will give from the spring of water of life without payment to the

499
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:58.970
one who conquers will have this heritage and I will be his God and he will be my

500
00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.810
son. But as for the cowardly,

501
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:07.330
