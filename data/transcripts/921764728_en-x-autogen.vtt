WEBVTT

1
00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:56.425
Well howdy church, uh, around these parts.

2
00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:58.865
We dress up at the end of every sermon series.

3
00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:06.105
Can't get there. I'm sorry.

4
00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:09.105
Um, this may be the first time in my life I've ever

5
00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:10.345
worn anything with a horse on it.

6
00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:12.945
Uh, and boots.

7
00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:14.585
I clearly don't have the right jeans for it,

8
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.225
but, uh, both borrowed.

9
00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:19.545
Uh, so what's the story here?

10
00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:22.585
One of our deacons suggested that we make this

11
00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.305
a cowboy spin today.

12
00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:28.745
Uh, because he thought the bumper video music

13
00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:31.265
that you just heard sounds like a spaghetti western.

14
00:01:32.365 --> 00:01:35.945
And so, uh, I have no idea.

15
00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:37.985
I've never watched one, so I'm gonna take his word for it.

16
00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:39.945
That's where we're at with that today.

17
00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:44.025
Uh, so anyway, that's why this is the way it is today.

18
00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:47.665
So, but we are bringing our first things

19
00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:48.865
first series to a close.

20
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.465
And we do dress up just not like this all the time.

21
00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:54.305
But hasn't this been a fruitful study?

22
00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:57.625
Uh, it has been for no one else but me at least,

23
00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:00.545
but, uh, just such a, a life giving

24
00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:03.625
deep dive into these doctrines.

25
00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:06.105
As a reminder, we've been building our theological jar,

26
00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:08.705
you might say over the last few weeks.

27
00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:11.985
And, uh, you, you look at the, the big rocks,

28
00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:14.425
the first things that we must agree on,

29
00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:17.905
the things about God, the things about his word,

30
00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:19.905
salvation about us, the,

31
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.625
the certain things about the end times.

32
00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:24.905
We've put those big rocks in first, but

33
00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:27.985
after that, we started to put these smaller rocks in.

34
00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:31.305
That's clarifying some distinctions about our church.

35
00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:34.385
Things that we would say kinda mark us off and,

36
00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:36.505
and why there are churches and denominations

37
00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:39.985
and they fit around the big rocks as you see.

38
00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:43.145
Well, today we're gonna pour in some sand.

39
00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:47.305
These are the less important doctrines of our faith.

40
00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:51.185
These things that, that we as believers can differ on

41
00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:55.265
and yet still be within the same church.

42
00:02:55.805 --> 00:02:57.585
So what kind of things are we talking about here?

43
00:02:57.615 --> 00:03:01.005
Well, these are in the church things, these beliefs,

44
00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:03.765
topics like the timing of Jesus' return.

45
00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:05.805
We got the big rocks on that.

46
00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:08.645
But the timing of, of how that plays out, of course,

47
00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:11.085
we can differ on and still be in the same church.

48
00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:14.725
You've got style of music, you've got, uh, clothing choices

49
00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:17.445
in the church that we can differ on and,

50
00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:21.005
and we can still be together in the church.

51
00:03:21.145 --> 00:03:22.965
But then it goes beyond that.

52
00:03:23.305 --> 00:03:27.085
It, it goes into these things in our lives, daily life

53
00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:29.965
that we would call areas of Christian liberty

54
00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:33.725
or freedom that we have the choice to do this or not.

55
00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:34.805
Now we're not talking about sin.

56
00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:37.805
We'll get to that clearly, but, but what I choose to do

57
00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:41.965
or not to do, we can differ on those things along the way.

58
00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:44.405
So this is things like tattoos

59
00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:47.685
or political parties that you might be a part of

60
00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:51.165
or have a glass of wine at dinner or plastic surgery

61
00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:54.925
or what holidays you choose to participate in

62
00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:56.485
or not participate in.

63
00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:58.285
You can see how we can

64
00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:01.805
get different opinions on those things.

65
00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:04.765
Yet the point is

66
00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:07.885
that we are still together in the same church.

67
00:04:07.905 --> 00:04:10.365
Now here's the thing. Even as I said, those things

68
00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:17.125
gave those lists the what abouts popped up in your mind,

69
00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:21.045
I'm sure, but, but what about, but,

70
00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:22.285
but what about how do we apply that?

71
00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:23.925
But, but what about this part of that?

72
00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:27.725
What about, and and we see that that causes the debates.

73
00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:33.055
Well, here's how we're gonna handle that.

74
00:04:33.175 --> 00:04:35.455
I can't trace every single one of those in your mind,

75
00:04:35.515 --> 00:04:38.975
of course, or every single issue that we would walk into.

76
00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:43.535
But the reality is what we can do

77
00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:48.135
is we can look into God's word for a framework on how

78
00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:53.015
to handle those third level sand issues in

79
00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:54.815
our lives that come up all the time,

80
00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:57.535
every day, multiple times a day.

81
00:04:57.595 --> 00:05:00.175
How do we decide what to do

82
00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:03.655
or not to do as Christians with this freedom we have?

83
00:05:04.955 --> 00:05:06.055
And first Corinthians eight

84
00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:07.615
and nine is gonna help us get there.

85
00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:09.455
And so turn there with me to

86
00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:11.815
one Corinthians in the New Testament

87
00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:15.255
and we're gonna start in one Corinthians eight verse one,

88
00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:22.955
one Corinthians eight and nine.

89
00:05:22.975 --> 00:05:24.675
Really we'll go through both chapters,

90
00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:26.355
but we'll start in verse one of chapter eight.

91
00:05:26.455 --> 00:05:28.555
Let me pray for us. God thank you

92
00:05:30.445 --> 00:05:32.655
that your word does lead us.

93
00:05:33.915 --> 00:05:38.215
It directs us. It gives us the ability to know you first.

94
00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:43.175
That was the point. But then it also helps us know

95
00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:45.775
what you want for us

96
00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:49.535
and want from us in light of who you are.

97
00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:53.525
And so as we look at at these things that

98
00:05:53.945 --> 00:05:55.685
so often divide us in the world,

99
00:05:56.675 --> 00:05:59.125
give us grace, give us unity.

100
00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:03.525
Give us ways to walk together towards you.

101
00:06:05.295 --> 00:06:06.385
Help us Holy Spirit.

102
00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:10.745
We need you to lead and direct us to give us wisdom.

103
00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:16.735
Help us in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.

104
00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:19.985
So here's what I'm gonna argue today.

105
00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:21.025
This is the, the thesis.

106
00:06:21.285 --> 00:06:26.205
You might say this is the point that we are free in Christ.

107
00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:29.565
Yes, but that freedom has limits.

108
00:06:31.445 --> 00:06:35.185
We are free in Christ. Galatians five, one for freedom.

109
00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:37.225
Christ has set us free.

110
00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:41.345
Yet there are limits to that.

111
00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:46.295
Now, as you hear that maybe some of us are even challenged

112
00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:48.215
by that there's no limits

113
00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:50.535
or maybe never thought about that at all.

114
00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:52.055
Or maybe you have the wrong limits. Maybe you're,

115
00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:54.255
you're putting too many strictures on

116
00:06:54.255 --> 00:06:55.415
things maybe, I don't know.

117
00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:59.055
My hope is that this is helpful to us all.

118
00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:04.055
And so that's the question. Okay, what do you mean by

119
00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:05.815
how our Christian liberty is limited?

120
00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:08.415
How is it limited? What does God's word say?

121
00:07:09.845 --> 00:07:13.615
Well, first it is limited by our love for believers

122
00:07:15.445 --> 00:07:18.055
because we love other believers.

123
00:07:19.575 --> 00:07:21.595
We limit our freedom.

124
00:07:24.055 --> 00:07:26.755
Now, the Corinthian church had written the Apostle Paul a

125
00:07:26.755 --> 00:07:28.635
letter at some point and they were asking a bunch

126
00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:31.195
of questions about how to live the Christian life.

127
00:07:31.195 --> 00:07:35.715
And one of those had to do with meat sacrificed to idols.

128
00:07:36.335 --> 00:07:37.835
Should they eat it? Should they not?

129
00:07:38.295 --> 00:07:39.675
Now why was that such a big deal?

130
00:07:40.705 --> 00:07:43.435
Because throughout history, God had made it a big deal

131
00:07:43.545 --> 00:07:46.915
that he commanded his people to avoid idolatry

132
00:07:47.775 --> 00:07:49.675
in all kinds of every way they could.

133
00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:52.755
And so to these people, now this was the process

134
00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:56.195
of eating food that had been offered to an idol.

135
00:07:57.015 --> 00:08:00.265
Was that right or wrong? Now they weren't offering it,

136
00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:02.825
but somehow they obtained it through other means.

137
00:08:02.925 --> 00:08:06.905
And so that that to them maybe towed the line of idolatry.

138
00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:08.065
Should we or shouldn't we?

139
00:08:08.065 --> 00:08:11.845
And there was a debate within the church about

140
00:08:11.905 --> 00:08:15.005
how far a Christian should go in that some people,

141
00:08:15.255 --> 00:08:17.445
their conscience felt like, yeah, I can eat that.

142
00:08:18.655 --> 00:08:21.205
While other people felt like their conscience restricted

143
00:08:21.205 --> 00:08:23.125
them from eating that meat.

144
00:08:24.415 --> 00:08:27.115
And so they asked Paul, well here's

145
00:08:27.115 --> 00:08:29.995
how the Holy Spirit inspired him to respond.

146
00:08:30.905 --> 00:08:33.915
This is chapter eight verses one through 13.

147
00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:38.845
Now, concerning food offered to idols,

148
00:08:38.845 --> 00:08:41.765
meaning I'm responding to your question, we know that all

149
00:08:41.765 --> 00:08:43.045
of us possess knowledge.

150
00:08:43.195 --> 00:08:46.165
This knowledge puffs up. But love builds up.

151
00:08:46.945 --> 00:08:49.525
If anyone imagines that he knows something he does not

152
00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:51.285
yet know as he ought to know.

153
00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:54.445
But if anyone loves God, he is known by God.

154
00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:57.925
Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols,

155
00:08:57.925 --> 00:09:00.325
we know that an idol has no real existence.

156
00:09:00.595 --> 00:09:04.005
That there is no God but one for,

157
00:09:04.165 --> 00:09:05.885
although there may be so-called Gods in heaven

158
00:09:06.065 --> 00:09:08.125
or on earth, as indeed there may be many

159
00:09:08.275 --> 00:09:09.405
gods and many lords.

160
00:09:09.745 --> 00:09:13.845
Yet for us there is one God the Father from whom all things

161
00:09:13.905 --> 00:09:15.285
and for whom we exist.

162
00:09:16.065 --> 00:09:19.005
And one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things

163
00:09:19.065 --> 00:09:20.885
and through whom we exist.

164
00:09:20.995 --> 00:09:23.005
He's tying it to a theological truth, right?

165
00:09:24.115 --> 00:09:27.005
However, not all possess this knowledge,

166
00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:31.645
but some through former association with idols eat food

167
00:09:31.645 --> 00:09:33.165
as really offered to an idol.

168
00:09:33.265 --> 00:09:36.325
And their conscience being weak is defiled.

169
00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:39.885
Food will not commend us to God.

170
00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:41.925
We're no worse off if we do not eat

171
00:09:41.945 --> 00:09:43.685
and we're no better off if we do.

172
00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:46.845
But take care that this right

173
00:09:46.865 --> 00:09:49.565
of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block

174
00:09:49.565 --> 00:09:52.445
to the weak for if anyone sees you

175
00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:55.165
who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple,

176
00:09:55.315 --> 00:09:57.125
will he not be encouraged if his I,

177
00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:59.365
if his conscience is weak to eat food offered

178
00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:00.605
to idols as well.

179
00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:05.365
And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed the

180
00:10:05.365 --> 00:10:06.845
brother for whom Christ died,

181
00:10:08.455 --> 00:10:10.065
thus sinning against your brothers

182
00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:11.425
and wounding their conscience.

183
00:10:11.425 --> 00:10:13.945
When it is weak, you sin against Christ.

184
00:10:15.485 --> 00:10:17.975
Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble,

185
00:10:18.215 --> 00:10:22.055
I will never eat meat lest I make my brother stumble.

186
00:10:24.755 --> 00:10:26.495
And so he's talking about this knowledge

187
00:10:26.495 --> 00:10:28.175
as he's mentioned it a few times throughout

188
00:10:28.175 --> 00:10:29.295
this little passage here.

189
00:10:29.565 --> 00:10:31.695
This knowledge he referred to is,

190
00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:33.495
is a Christian's understanding

191
00:10:33.495 --> 00:10:36.255
that they're now not under the law anymore,

192
00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:38.735
that they're free from, that they don't have

193
00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:40.135
to follow all the regulations

194
00:10:40.245 --> 00:10:43.935
that God has declared all the food out there clean.

195
00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:46.225
Now they can eat it.

196
00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.665
But notice again the context Intext.

197
00:10:51.205 --> 00:10:53.975
Paul is primarily concerned with the unity of the church

198
00:10:55.845 --> 00:10:56.985
for the building up

199
00:10:57.005 --> 00:10:59.905
of the church in love toward one another.

200
00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:04.115
And he says a couple ways that they were to do that.

201
00:11:04.115 --> 00:11:05.515
First, that they were not

202
00:11:05.575 --> 00:11:07.955
to stand in judgment over other people.

203
00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:12.205
They were not to stand as believers in the church.

204
00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:15.925
They were not to stand in judgment over others.

205
00:11:17.955 --> 00:11:19.575
In fact, that's what verse eight says.

206
00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:23.125
Look again, food will

207
00:11:23.145 --> 00:11:24.685
not commend us to God.

208
00:11:25.265 --> 00:11:27.365
We are no worse off if we do not eat.

209
00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:29.645
And we're no better off if we do.

210
00:11:32.155 --> 00:11:35.255
So there was a judgmental spirit within the Corinthian

211
00:11:35.255 --> 00:11:37.055
church that actually was going both ways.

212
00:11:37.505 --> 00:11:41.015
Those people who were abstaining from eating the food were

213
00:11:41.015 --> 00:11:43.495
looking down on those who did eat the food

214
00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:45.575
as if they were somehow compromising their faith.

215
00:11:46.515 --> 00:11:49.135
And those who ate the food were looking down

216
00:11:49.135 --> 00:11:50.255
on those who abstained.

217
00:11:50.565 --> 00:11:52.295
Like they're weak in some way.

218
00:11:54.655 --> 00:11:57.675
But Paul here says, neither of you are right

219
00:11:58.815 --> 00:12:00.035
and neither of you are wrong.

220
00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:03.095
You, you choose this or that.

221
00:12:03.095 --> 00:12:05.055
Neither of you are right, neither of you are wrong.

222
00:12:05.075 --> 00:12:08.015
In other words, if it's not a biblical command

223
00:12:09.035 --> 00:12:11.295
at this point, it is post law, right?

224
00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:12.895
It's not a biblical command anymore.

225
00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:16.295
I have no right to say that what my conscience allows

226
00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.015
yours should allow too.

227
00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:24.565
Or what my conscience forbids yours should forbid as well.

228
00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:30.365
And just think about how often that comes up in life

229
00:12:31.445 --> 00:12:32.625
within the church, right?

230
00:12:34.425 --> 00:12:36.215
Lemme just give you one simple example.

231
00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:38.895
It's my personal conviction

232
00:12:38.895 --> 00:12:40.615
that I'm not gonna drink alcohol at all.

233
00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:43.585
But I can't stand here

234
00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:46.585
and say to any of you of legal age that you can't

235
00:12:46.695 --> 00:12:48.585
because my conscience says I can't.

236
00:12:51.445 --> 00:12:55.195
Now what I can say, Ephesians five 18 says,

237
00:12:55.195 --> 00:12:56.875
getting drunk is a sin.

238
00:12:57.815 --> 00:12:59.195
So I can lean on that

239
00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:01.875
and say, you, you should not get drunk.

240
00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:04.475
That's a command of the Lord.

241
00:13:06.345 --> 00:13:07.925
And just as a side note, I don't know

242
00:13:07.925 --> 00:13:10.565
what blood alcohol content God says is drunk or not.

243
00:13:10.565 --> 00:13:13.325
That's up to you. Like I don't know.

244
00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:15.085
So that's between you and him.

245
00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:18.205
But, but the point here is

246
00:13:18.205 --> 00:13:21.445
that I can't impose my personal conviction on you.

247
00:13:22.965 --> 00:13:25.065
And you can't stand in judgment over me

248
00:13:25.065 --> 00:13:28.225
that I'm weaker in some way that I just chose not to, right?

249
00:13:28.225 --> 00:13:29.705
That's the point he's making here.

250
00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:33.305
'cause no one is closer to God if you do choose

251
00:13:33.365 --> 00:13:35.825
to do something or if you don't choose to do something

252
00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:37.465
that is a conviction issue.

253
00:13:40.975 --> 00:13:42.835
But here's what that would've led to back then.

254
00:13:43.135 --> 00:13:45.475
And so they're, they're reading this out loud to the church

255
00:13:45.495 --> 00:13:47.635
and somebody's hearing him say these things.

256
00:13:47.655 --> 00:13:49.555
And what that could have led to is that those

257
00:13:49.615 --> 00:13:52.675
who are choosing the, the majority probably

258
00:13:52.675 --> 00:13:56.735
who did eat the meat, they could have been hearing this

259
00:13:56.755 --> 00:13:58.975
and started to feel like Paul was siding with them.

260
00:14:00.855 --> 00:14:03.345
Like he's saying, man, all of us should eat.

261
00:14:03.405 --> 00:14:04.865
Why would you not eat it?

262
00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:07.825
I mean he, he's supporting all right to do this, right?

263
00:14:10.615 --> 00:14:11.995
But did you notice what Paul did here?

264
00:14:14.785 --> 00:14:16.275
He's focusing on love,

265
00:14:16.385 --> 00:14:18.155
he's focusing on building up the church.

266
00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:21.955
And so he quickly shifted to not just saying, Hey,

267
00:14:21.955 --> 00:14:23.715
don't judge each other if you do or don't.

268
00:14:24.055 --> 00:14:27.275
He also shifted to this, this encouragement

269
00:14:27.295 --> 00:14:31.115
to avoid putting an obstacle in the way of other believers.

270
00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:34.275
So yeah, don't stand in judgment.

271
00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:37.555
You're closer to God, no, neither way.

272
00:14:38.535 --> 00:14:41.075
But don't put an obstacle

273
00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:43.925
in the way of one another.

274
00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.385
This is what he says in verse nine, the scandal

275
00:14:49.365 --> 00:14:53.045
of a stumbling block to the weak that those

276
00:14:53.045 --> 00:14:55.365
who understood freedom in Christ saying, yeah, we can,

277
00:14:55.425 --> 00:14:57.605
we have no qualms about it conscience wise.

278
00:14:58.155 --> 00:15:02.335
They bulldozed over those

279
00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:04.375
who didn't have that conviction.

280
00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:10.455
And that word literally means to trip someone up that you,

281
00:15:10.555 --> 00:15:12.335
you cause someone to fall.

282
00:15:12.405 --> 00:15:15.455
It's a stumbling block in a, you might imagine a pathway

283
00:15:15.565 --> 00:15:18.815
that there's a rock sticking up and that trips someone up.

284
00:15:18.815 --> 00:15:21.015
That's what this word literally means.

285
00:15:21.155 --> 00:15:24.015
It means someone who ha had come out of that world

286
00:15:24.015 --> 00:15:28.565
of idolatry and that was sucking them in over and over

287
00:15:28.745 --> 00:15:31.285
and they come to Christ and then they see a brother

288
00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:32.885
or sister eating the same meat

289
00:15:32.885 --> 00:15:34.605
that was just offered to the idol.

290
00:15:34.675 --> 00:15:36.685
They might be tempted to fall right back into it.

291
00:15:38.465 --> 00:15:42.365
And Paul says, you have to avoid that within the church.

292
00:15:42.615 --> 00:15:45.685
Don't create obstacles for others. Now, now I know.

293
00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:49.965
Listen, what happens really quickly when we hear something

294
00:15:49.965 --> 00:15:52.805
like that with our libertarian tendencies in America,

295
00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:54.325
we, we say, no, no, no.

296
00:15:54.325 --> 00:15:57.885
Hold up. Somebody else's conscience is gonna limit me.

297
00:15:57.945 --> 00:16:02.625
Really? That doesn't work. That doesn't work in America.

298
00:16:07.295 --> 00:16:10.155
But, but notice, and by the way, just just as a side note,

299
00:16:10.155 --> 00:16:12.155
chapter 10, you go read that later.

300
00:16:12.295 --> 00:16:15.515
He does envision scenarios that you can eat the meat.

301
00:16:15.515 --> 00:16:17.515
Like he's not saying it's impossible,

302
00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:23.785
but look at how forcefully he says his point here in verses

303
00:16:23.785 --> 00:16:26.725
11 and 12, look again at this

304
00:16:29.145 --> 00:16:33.635
says, so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed,

305
00:16:34.715 --> 00:16:36.775
the brother for whom Christ died,

306
00:16:39.015 --> 00:16:41.105
thus sinning against your brothers

307
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.865
and wounding their conscience.

308
00:16:42.865 --> 00:16:45.585
When it is weak, you sin against Christ.

309
00:16:51.815 --> 00:16:55.145
What he's saying is that if we really love our brothers

310
00:16:55.145 --> 00:16:58.905
and sisters in Christ, why do we flaunt our freedoms?

311
00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:06.715
Why do we not consider others that he says, are those

312
00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:08.275
for whom Christ died to?

313
00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:15.785
I don't think we ask those questions very often.

314
00:17:16.485 --> 00:17:20.355
But he says,

315
00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:24.635
our goal must be love for our brothers and sisters.

316
00:17:24.895 --> 00:17:27.075
Not that we would knock them down in any way,

317
00:17:27.075 --> 00:17:29.315
but that we would instead build them up.

318
00:17:33.725 --> 00:17:37.555
Romans 14 and 15 says a lot of the same things,

319
00:17:37.555 --> 00:17:38.795
but this is Romans 1420.

320
00:17:38.855 --> 00:17:40.595
He says, do not for the sake of food,

321
00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:41.915
destroy the work of God.

322
00:17:43.015 --> 00:17:44.845
Everything is indeed clean,

323
00:17:44.905 --> 00:17:47.965
but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by

324
00:17:47.965 --> 00:17:52.315
what he eats in Romans 15, one and two.

325
00:17:52.315 --> 00:17:54.915
We who are strong have an obligation to bear

326
00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:57.875
with the failings of the weak not to please ourselves.

327
00:17:59.215 --> 00:18:01.595
Let each of us please his neighbor for his good

328
00:18:01.695 --> 00:18:03.835
to build him up.

329
00:18:05.855 --> 00:18:07.795
See, the orientation of our hearts

330
00:18:08.535 --> 00:18:12.155
as believers must be self-sacrificial.

331
00:18:13.395 --> 00:18:15.125
It's what one Corinthians eight 13 said,

332
00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:18.005
if meat makes my brother stumble, I'll never eat meat.

333
00:18:19.895 --> 00:18:22.715
If fill in the blank choice decision makes my brother

334
00:18:22.715 --> 00:18:24.315
stumble, I'm never gonna do it ever again.

335
00:18:26.075 --> 00:18:29.895
That's the orientation in one Corinthians eight.

336
00:18:32.465 --> 00:18:35.605
And so he's saying to us as the church internally,

337
00:18:35.755 --> 00:18:37.485
this is the key element

338
00:18:38.475 --> 00:18:41.165
that limits our freedom in Christ,

339
00:18:44.655 --> 00:18:45.875
but it also is limited.

340
00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:48.635
Our freedom in Christ is also limited by our love

341
00:18:49.055 --> 00:18:50.275
for unbelievers.

342
00:18:52.725 --> 00:18:54.785
So we just saw in one Corinthians eight, it's limited

343
00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.865
by our love for one another in the church,

344
00:18:58.285 --> 00:19:02.145
but then it's also limited here by our love for unbelievers.

345
00:19:02.145 --> 00:19:05.625
There's a missional aspect of this limiting

346
00:19:05.685 --> 00:19:08.625
of our Christian liberty, our freedoms as well.

347
00:19:10.725 --> 00:19:13.545
So what he does in chapter nine is he lays out a long

348
00:19:13.545 --> 00:19:14.905
defense of his ministry.

349
00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:18.635
Paul's an apostle of Christ, he's spreading the gospel.

350
00:19:19.175 --> 00:19:20.395
And so at that time,

351
00:19:20.415 --> 00:19:22.235
and even today, he had every right

352
00:19:23.745 --> 00:19:26.805
to take financial support as an apostle

353
00:19:26.805 --> 00:19:28.045
and a minister of the gospel.

354
00:19:28.905 --> 00:19:31.525
He, he absolutely could. He could have done that,

355
00:19:31.785 --> 00:19:34.995
but he didn't in this context.

356
00:19:35.295 --> 00:19:36.515
He didn't. And he explained why.

357
00:19:36.515 --> 00:19:38.315
This is chapter nine, verse 12.

358
00:19:39.665 --> 00:19:41.475
Skip ahead a little bit and see what he says.

359
00:19:46.025 --> 00:19:50.245
He says, nevertheless, we have not made use of this rite,

360
00:19:51.585 --> 00:19:55.605
but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the

361
00:19:55.605 --> 00:19:57.845
way of the gospel of Christ.

362
00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:02.155
Paul had a personal conviction

363
00:20:02.305 --> 00:20:04.835
that taking financial assistance from the church

364
00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:07.955
would hinder his gospel witness.

365
00:20:12.245 --> 00:20:13.825
Now we might wonder, how does that work out?

366
00:20:13.855 --> 00:20:16.465
Well, he, he, he saw it this way

367
00:20:16.495 --> 00:20:21.425
that unbelievers might see him merely as a, a hired hand

368
00:20:21.615 --> 00:20:23.345
that he's just preaching the gospel.

369
00:20:23.575 --> 00:20:24.705
This, this message.

370
00:20:24.815 --> 00:20:28.345
He's just preaching it to be, uh, to get a paycheck.

371
00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:32.555
There's really no reason for him to do it.

372
00:20:32.615 --> 00:20:34.515
Any other reason except

373
00:20:34.655 --> 00:20:37.475
for in his mind he knew he was doing it merely

374
00:20:37.475 --> 00:20:40.395
for the reward of Christ and for his pleasure.

375
00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:43.595
But that's what he was saying to the church.

376
00:20:44.275 --> 00:20:46.315
I don't wanna, I don't wanna create an obstacle

377
00:20:46.315 --> 00:20:47.365
for anyone to hear the gospel.

378
00:20:51.415 --> 00:20:52.875
And notice what he said in verse 12.

379
00:20:52.895 --> 00:20:54.795
He would rather endure anything

380
00:20:55.715 --> 00:20:57.605
than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel.

381
00:20:58.205 --> 00:21:02.055
Anything poverty, beatings,

382
00:21:02.325 --> 00:21:04.055
even death, anything.

383
00:21:06.385 --> 00:21:07.875
I'll endure it for the sake of the gospel.

384
00:21:09.725 --> 00:21:11.905
Now that that's piercing enough to us, right?

385
00:21:13.575 --> 00:21:17.705
Like are we willing? But notice what he's saying in this.

386
00:21:18.765 --> 00:21:23.745
His point here, he's saying, out of love for unbelievers,

387
00:21:25.525 --> 00:21:28.665
we are not required to employ our rights

388
00:21:32.015 --> 00:21:34.035
out of love for unbelievers.

389
00:21:35.905 --> 00:21:40.555
None of us are required to utilize the rights

390
00:21:40.555 --> 00:21:42.115
and freedoms that we have in Christ.

391
00:21:43.485 --> 00:21:47.775
We're not required to you.

392
00:21:47.775 --> 00:21:51.175
And I might be free to do this or free to do that of course.

393
00:21:51.675 --> 00:21:53.015
But no one is saying we have to.

394
00:21:56.055 --> 00:21:59.105
What Paul is illustrating here is that we can self limit

395
00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:02.385
for the sake of the gospel spreading more.

396
00:22:05.745 --> 00:22:07.595
Like have we ever thought that way

397
00:22:07.595 --> 00:22:11.255
before that?

398
00:22:11.255 --> 00:22:12.855
Just because I have the right

399
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:16.935
to say something on social media doesn't mean we have to.

400
00:22:20.535 --> 00:22:22.265
That maybe I can limit myself.

401
00:22:22.295 --> 00:22:25.385
Like yeah, I could say I can limit myself for the sake

402
00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:27.945
of the gospel actually going forward.

403
00:22:29.145 --> 00:22:30.845
And so people don't think I'm a jerk

404
00:22:31.825 --> 00:22:34.005
and people don't think that Christians are certain ways

405
00:22:34.005 --> 00:22:35.605
that we can limit that for the sake

406
00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:38.605
of someone actually hearing the gospel instead

407
00:22:38.605 --> 00:22:43.565
of just writing a song that just

408
00:22:43.565 --> 00:22:45.005
because I can watch this show

409
00:22:45.145 --> 00:22:48.845
or I can listen to that artist, no one is requiring me to

410
00:22:50.825 --> 00:22:51.925
do you have the freedom to do it.

411
00:22:51.925 --> 00:22:56.065
Yeah, okay. But not doing it might actually show

412
00:22:56.065 --> 00:22:57.105
the world a different life.

413
00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:02.875
Something's different about me, about our faith.

414
00:23:04.305 --> 00:23:07.005
See, what Paul does is he examines his life

415
00:23:07.225 --> 00:23:10.365
and he thinks about ways that people in his sphere

416
00:23:10.365 --> 00:23:12.685
of influence would interpret what he's doing.

417
00:23:14.485 --> 00:23:16.215
He's actually considering unbelievers

418
00:23:16.215 --> 00:23:18.135
and saying, well, how would they better receive?

419
00:23:18.235 --> 00:23:19.375
How would they better hear?

420
00:23:19.475 --> 00:23:23.735
And what he does is he purposefully sets aside some

421
00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:25.855
of his rights for the sake of the gospel.

422
00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:34.345
Do we ever do that? Are we ever considering that?

423
00:23:38.085 --> 00:23:39.535
Because here's, here's what

424
00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:43.335
what I think maybe we we're steeped in this American culture

425
00:23:45.965 --> 00:23:48.255
that our goal should not merely be

426
00:23:48.355 --> 00:23:51.455
to live the most free lives we can in Christ.

427
00:23:52.635 --> 00:23:56.815
That can't be the end game. That can't be the goal.

428
00:23:59.545 --> 00:24:00.645
We should love one another.

429
00:24:00.645 --> 00:24:03.325
But our goal also should be to fulfill this command

430
00:24:03.545 --> 00:24:08.525
to serve our neighbors, this call

431
00:24:08.525 --> 00:24:10.165
of God to serve our neighbors.

432
00:24:13.615 --> 00:24:15.795
And this is what Galatians five says for you.

433
00:24:15.795 --> 00:24:18.035
Were called to freedom brothers only.

434
00:24:18.175 --> 00:24:21.435
Do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh,

435
00:24:23.235 --> 00:24:24.255
but through love.

436
00:24:24.465 --> 00:24:28.955
Serve one another for the whole laws fulfilled in one word.

437
00:24:29.295 --> 00:24:32.275
You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

438
00:24:35.305 --> 00:24:39.115
Don't use it for selfish reasons. Use it to serve others.

439
00:24:40.885 --> 00:24:43.105
And watch how Paul does it here in one Corinthians nine,

440
00:24:43.105 --> 00:24:45.185
he sets aside his rights for the sake

441
00:24:45.185 --> 00:24:46.745
of the gospel to love unbelievers.

442
00:24:46.765 --> 00:24:51.025
And he says this, this is verses 19 through 23

443
00:24:52.325 --> 00:24:55.945
in one Corinthians nine, for though I'm free from all,

444
00:24:56.055 --> 00:25:00.305
I've made myself a servant to all that, I might win more

445
00:25:00.445 --> 00:25:02.465
of them to the Jews.

446
00:25:02.545 --> 00:25:05.785
I became a Jew in order to win Jews to those under the law.

447
00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:09.705
I became as one under the law though not myself being under

448
00:25:09.705 --> 00:25:11.745
the law, that I might win those under the law

449
00:25:12.285 --> 00:25:13.545
to those outside the law.

450
00:25:13.665 --> 00:25:16.585
I became as one, outside the law, not being outside the law

451
00:25:16.585 --> 00:25:19.545
of God, but under the law of Christ that I might win those

452
00:25:19.655 --> 00:25:21.385
outside the law to the weak.

453
00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:23.945
I became weak that I might win the weak. I might.

454
00:25:24.175 --> 00:25:26.305
I've become all things to all people that

455
00:25:26.405 --> 00:25:28.545
by all means I might save some

456
00:25:29.365 --> 00:25:32.705
and I do it all for the sake of the gospel that I may share

457
00:25:32.855 --> 00:25:35.025
with them in its blessings.

458
00:25:38.255 --> 00:25:41.585
Paul chose the hard way to be in the world,

459
00:25:41.725 --> 00:25:46.215
but not of the world to be spiritually distinct

460
00:25:46.555 --> 00:25:48.535
but not socially segregated.

461
00:25:50.775 --> 00:25:53.155
And there's a tension in that. I understand.

462
00:25:53.375 --> 00:25:54.715
Yes, there always is.

463
00:25:54.735 --> 00:25:57.715
But what Paul advocated here for the purpose of the gospel

464
00:25:58.435 --> 00:26:01.315
ministry, for the purpose of evangelism, he said,

465
00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:03.035
I'm gonna be a servant to all,

466
00:26:03.065 --> 00:26:05.715
even though I'm free from all I can do these things,

467
00:26:06.015 --> 00:26:08.435
I'm gonna be a servant to all.

468
00:26:10.935 --> 00:26:12.075
And notice how he did it.

469
00:26:12.075 --> 00:26:13.435
He did it with those who were Jewish,

470
00:26:13.585 --> 00:26:15.715
accommodating their sensitivities

471
00:26:15.775 --> 00:26:18.515
to the degree he could to gain a hearing.

472
00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:21.995
Like he wouldn't eat a pulled pork sandwich

473
00:26:22.055 --> 00:26:23.155
in front of Jewish people.

474
00:26:23.155 --> 00:26:24.355
Like that's just what he wasn't gonna do.

475
00:26:24.555 --> 00:26:26.635
'cause he wanted them to listen to the gospel.

476
00:26:26.855 --> 00:26:29.755
He did it with gentiles, with non-Jews

477
00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:31.155
that those were outside the law.

478
00:26:31.155 --> 00:26:33.595
He didn't expect them to act Jewish because they weren't.

479
00:26:34.735 --> 00:26:35.755
He met 'em where they were.

480
00:26:35.975 --> 00:26:37.595
He said, here's what we're about.

481
00:26:37.775 --> 00:26:39.435
I'm not gonna bind up your conscience

482
00:26:39.435 --> 00:26:41.035
with the law 'cause you're not under it.

483
00:26:43.965 --> 00:26:48.375
Basically Paul was re was prepared to relinquish

484
00:26:48.935 --> 00:26:50.975
whatever right was necessary

485
00:26:53.415 --> 00:26:56.715
if doing so would cause unnecessary obstacles to the gospel.

486
00:26:58.435 --> 00:27:01.775
He said, I'm gonna do whatever it takes apart from sin

487
00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:03.055
to reach these people.

488
00:27:03.155 --> 00:27:04.735
He was under the law of Christ.

489
00:27:04.765 --> 00:27:07.855
What the Bible says is the royal law, the law of love,

490
00:27:08.205 --> 00:27:10.255
what Jesus said is second only to loving God.

491
00:27:10.275 --> 00:27:13.415
He says, my goal is to love my neighbor as myself.

492
00:27:15.225 --> 00:27:16.285
That's the law of Christ.

493
00:27:18.265 --> 00:27:19.765
And so just think about that for a second.

494
00:27:21.495 --> 00:27:25.875
Do we love unbelievers enough to limit ourselves

495
00:27:28.395 --> 00:27:31.055
so that they can see Jesus clearly through our lives

496
00:27:31.115 --> 00:27:32.935
so they're not distracted by us?

497
00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:36.475
Like are we considering their lives?

498
00:27:36.535 --> 00:27:38.155
Are we considering where they stand?

499
00:27:38.215 --> 00:27:40.235
Are we lovingly meeting where they are?

500
00:27:40.375 --> 00:27:41.595
Are we seeking to love them

501
00:27:41.655 --> 00:27:43.395
and serve them where they are,

502
00:27:43.825 --> 00:27:46.555
what their thought process is, what their hangups are?

503
00:27:46.975 --> 00:27:51.875
Are we caring enough for them? Now, hear me clearly.

504
00:27:52.615 --> 00:27:54.435
I'm not saying we cave on our morals

505
00:27:55.585 --> 00:27:59.255
or we we deny the truth of the gospel.

506
00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:03.215
I'm not saying we sin so that we gain a hearing.

507
00:28:04.515 --> 00:28:08.925
We don't behave like unbelievers.

508
00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:12.845
We just identify with them as much as we can.

509
00:28:14.305 --> 00:28:15.605
We meet them in their world.

510
00:28:15.665 --> 00:28:17.925
We try to reach them by accommodating

511
00:28:17.925 --> 00:28:20.085
and non sinful things to where we can know

512
00:28:20.315 --> 00:28:21.565
that they are going to listen.

513
00:28:21.945 --> 00:28:23.805
And we haven't put any stumbling blocks

514
00:28:23.805 --> 00:28:24.965
in the way of them hearing the gospel.

515
00:28:30.705 --> 00:28:31.965
So there's a couple limits, right?

516
00:28:31.965 --> 00:28:34.845
There's our love for Christians, there's our love

517
00:28:34.865 --> 00:28:36.045
for non-Christians.

518
00:28:36.045 --> 00:28:37.965
Those are limits to our freedom.

519
00:28:39.845 --> 00:28:42.175
There's actually a third limiting factor here

520
00:28:44.005 --> 00:28:47.335
that we are limited by our love for Christ.

521
00:28:48.895 --> 00:28:51.995
We are to limit our freedoms by our love for Christ.

522
00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:56.345
This is the end of chapter nine.

523
00:28:57.605 --> 00:29:02.455
He continues in verses 24 through 27, says,

524
00:29:02.475 --> 00:29:05.455
do you not know that in a race all the runners run

525
00:29:05.555 --> 00:29:07.215
but only one receives the prize?

526
00:29:08.155 --> 00:29:09.615
So run that, you may obtain it.

527
00:29:09.865 --> 00:29:12.615
Every athlete exercises self-control in all things

528
00:29:12.995 --> 00:29:15.615
and they do it to receive a perishable w reef.

529
00:29:15.675 --> 00:29:20.475
But we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly.

530
00:29:20.555 --> 00:29:22.155
I don't box as one beating the air.

531
00:29:22.435 --> 00:29:25.795
I discipline my body, keep it under control.

532
00:29:26.475 --> 00:29:27.675
Lest after preaching to others,

533
00:29:27.955 --> 00:29:29.675
I myself should be disqualified.

534
00:29:31.435 --> 00:29:34.645
What he's saying by that, by using illustrations of

535
00:29:35.205 --> 00:29:38.685
athletics, the Olympics sports,

536
00:29:38.795 --> 00:29:40.805
what he's saying is now in Christ,

537
00:29:41.275 --> 00:29:46.255
it's not just do whatever I wanna do now I just get

538
00:29:46.255 --> 00:29:48.335
to do now have free, free to do whatever.

539
00:29:48.335 --> 00:29:49.775
Right? That's not what he's saying.

540
00:29:49.835 --> 00:29:52.135
No, he's saying our lives in Christ are

541
00:29:52.135 --> 00:29:56.095
to be purposeful in everything we do.

542
00:29:57.565 --> 00:30:00.255
Just like an athlete, there's self discipline.

543
00:30:01.205 --> 00:30:02.535
Like if you want to run

544
00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:04.775
and win, you have to be disciplined, you have

545
00:30:04.775 --> 00:30:06.135
to have a direction, you have

546
00:30:06.135 --> 00:30:08.895
to be purposeful in everything you do to be the best

547
00:30:08.995 --> 00:30:10.415
and win the race.

548
00:30:13.485 --> 00:30:15.625
So when we're considering freedom

549
00:30:16.385 --> 00:30:18.825
decisions, couple questions.

550
00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:23.205
As we live out this response to Christ's love

551
00:30:23.265 --> 00:30:24.765
for us, how do we do it?

552
00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:30.125
How do we choose wisely first? Does this spur growth?

553
00:30:33.005 --> 00:30:34.885
I dunno, maybe it's the western theme that just brought this

554
00:30:34.885 --> 00:30:36.365
to mind, but is, does this spur growth,

555
00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:39.525
this whatever I'm about to do, the decision,

556
00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:42.565
the the direction, the action, the the word,

557
00:30:42.595 --> 00:30:44.725
does it spur growth in?

558
00:30:44.725 --> 00:30:48.405
Does it? Does it provoke my spiritual maturity

559
00:30:48.545 --> 00:30:49.965
and development in the Lord?

560
00:30:50.275 --> 00:30:52.885
Does it stir my affections for Jesus

561
00:30:53.305 --> 00:30:54.405
or does it hinder,

562
00:30:57.715 --> 00:31:00.485
does it make me more like Jesus or not?

563
00:31:00.705 --> 00:31:03.325
And and you think about, I'm like, what's our goal now

564
00:31:04.445 --> 00:31:05.825
our goal is to please him.

565
00:31:06.195 --> 00:31:08.545
Colossians says that our goal is to please the Lord,

566
00:31:08.605 --> 00:31:10.425
to live a life pleasing to him.

567
00:31:10.425 --> 00:31:12.225
What pleases him, obeying him,

568
00:31:13.975 --> 00:31:15.825
growing in my ability to obey him.

569
00:31:15.825 --> 00:31:17.145
That's what pleases him.

570
00:31:17.145 --> 00:31:21.605
And so when I'm faced with a freedom decision, I need

571
00:31:21.605 --> 00:31:26.085
to ask myself, does this point me more toward Jesus or not?

572
00:31:26.395 --> 00:31:28.485
Does this make me more like Jesus or not?

573
00:31:30.695 --> 00:31:33.315
That's a limiter to my freedom, right?

574
00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:37.215
But there's something even bigger than that.

575
00:31:37.275 --> 00:31:39.135
And it's the question that gets raised at the

576
00:31:39.155 --> 00:31:40.335
end of chapter 10.

577
00:31:42.625 --> 00:31:44.485
See, he's continuing to discuss this

578
00:31:45.745 --> 00:31:47.325
eating meat or not question.

579
00:31:47.425 --> 00:31:49.365
He applies it even magnifies it

580
00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:51.605
by making this statement at the end of chapter 10.

581
00:31:51.605 --> 00:31:54.725
The very last couple verses verse 31, he says,

582
00:31:54.865 --> 00:31:56.845
so whether you eat or drink

583
00:31:57.425 --> 00:32:01.875
or whatever you do, do all

584
00:32:01.875 --> 00:32:05.825
to the glory of God whether you eat or not.

585
00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:12.025
And in everything, your goal should be to glorify God.

586
00:32:12.025 --> 00:32:16.265
That's the fundamental question above all else, what it does

587
00:32:16.265 --> 00:32:17.545
to you, what it does to someone else.

588
00:32:17.725 --> 00:32:21.185
The biggest question in all of this, does it glorify God

589
00:32:22.455 --> 00:32:24.425
when you're faced with a decision, when you're faced

590
00:32:24.425 --> 00:32:28.025
with a freedom option, does this glorify God?

591
00:32:31.095 --> 00:32:34.265
Does it show the world around me that I'm a child of God,

592
00:32:34.455 --> 00:32:37.305
that I have a new self within me, that my goal is

593
00:32:37.305 --> 00:32:39.845
to represent God well, does it glorify him?

594
00:32:40.195 --> 00:32:43.485
That decision will limit us.

595
00:32:45.725 --> 00:32:48.895
Like when you start to think that way, you start

596
00:32:48.895 --> 00:32:51.855
to think about how to glorify God in everything, man,

597
00:32:51.855 --> 00:32:53.415
that's gonna limit some of the things we do, right?

598
00:32:54.085 --> 00:32:56.905
Like if our number one goal was to please him,

599
00:32:57.165 --> 00:32:59.465
not please ourselves, we'd be different.

600
00:33:04.425 --> 00:33:06.285
And so here's how I wanna bring all this together,

601
00:33:06.555 --> 00:33:08.845
this today to try to sum it all up to me,

602
00:33:09.135 --> 00:33:10.245
flowcharts are beautiful.

603
00:33:10.365 --> 00:33:11.925
I dunno if that's engineering background, but,

604
00:33:12.105 --> 00:33:15.165
but I found this flowchart and our team made it look pretty.

605
00:33:15.225 --> 00:33:16.325
So we're gonna put it up on this screen.

606
00:33:16.325 --> 00:33:17.725
You might take a picture of it if you want,

607
00:33:19.025 --> 00:33:20.525
but I wanna walk through this together

608
00:33:20.525 --> 00:33:22.645
because this is gonna help us kind

609
00:33:22.645 --> 00:33:25.485
of formulate a process of decision making.

610
00:33:26.455 --> 00:33:28.045
It'll take everything we've just said

611
00:33:28.045 --> 00:33:30.045
and it'll help us learn how to make decisions.

612
00:33:30.055 --> 00:33:32.405
Again, at the top over all of it, you see,

613
00:33:32.785 --> 00:33:34.165
do it all for the glory of God.

614
00:33:34.165 --> 00:33:35.445
That's one Corinthians 10 31.

615
00:33:35.445 --> 00:33:38.685
That should be number one over everything we do,

616
00:33:38.795 --> 00:33:41.245
fundamental to our decisions.

617
00:33:41.245 --> 00:33:42.245
But then you start left

618
00:33:42.245 --> 00:33:45.815
to right and let's walk through this.

619
00:33:45.875 --> 00:33:48.335
The first question, when you're faced with a decision to do

620
00:33:48.335 --> 00:33:50.215
or not do or what you're gonna think about,

621
00:33:50.435 --> 00:33:53.175
how you're gonna decide, does the Bible allow it?

622
00:33:54.785 --> 00:33:56.885
If no, don't do it.

623
00:33:59.325 --> 00:34:00.505
It seems pretty simple, right?

624
00:34:01.055 --> 00:34:02.665
Like that should be foundational basic.

625
00:34:03.655 --> 00:34:05.265
Sometimes we get tripped up with that one.

626
00:34:05.305 --> 00:34:06.665
I know, but, but that should be first.

627
00:34:06.765 --> 00:34:10.185
If the Bible says Don't do this, don't do it.

628
00:34:12.645 --> 00:34:14.145
If the Bible does allow it though,

629
00:34:14.145 --> 00:34:15.625
then then you ask the next question,

630
00:34:15.625 --> 00:34:17.545
does my conscience allow it?

631
00:34:20.025 --> 00:34:22.965
It may not be a biblical truth one way or the other,

632
00:34:22.985 --> 00:34:24.725
but does my conscience, you should never,

633
00:34:25.025 --> 00:34:26.685
we should never do something

634
00:34:26.685 --> 00:34:28.805
that internally we feel is wrong.

635
00:34:31.935 --> 00:34:33.675
And again, it may not be wrong for somebody else, but

636
00:34:33.735 --> 00:34:36.555
but for me, I shouldn't go past that.

637
00:34:39.025 --> 00:34:41.045
But if you're good there, what

638
00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:43.765
that means then is you're in an area of Christian freedom.

639
00:34:46.335 --> 00:34:47.835
But what we've done with that typically is

640
00:34:47.835 --> 00:34:48.955
we've just thrown caution to the wind.

641
00:34:48.955 --> 00:34:51.955
We just go for it. Yeah, my conscious allows it,

642
00:34:51.975 --> 00:34:53.195
I'm just gonna go do it.

643
00:34:55.095 --> 00:34:57.435
But I hope you've seen that's not the law of Christ, right?

644
00:34:58.185 --> 00:35:00.195
It's not the way we should follow the Lord.

645
00:35:00.195 --> 00:35:02.555
Instead, we need to ask three further questions.

646
00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:06.115
Okay, you're an area of liberty, got that,

647
00:35:06.455 --> 00:35:07.995
but what then first question,

648
00:35:08.025 --> 00:35:10.955
what is its effect on other Christians?

649
00:35:13.725 --> 00:35:15.205
'cause we just saw in one Corinthians eight,

650
00:35:15.955 --> 00:35:18.405
love is more important than freedom.

651
00:35:20.015 --> 00:35:21.265
Does this affect someone else?

652
00:35:21.365 --> 00:35:24.225
Is this gonna hinder someone else's walk with Christ?

653
00:35:26.535 --> 00:35:29.915
Second question. What is this effect on this activity

654
00:35:30.415 --> 00:35:32.555
of this activity on non-Christians?

655
00:35:35.945 --> 00:35:38.605
Is this gonna affect the witness that we have?

656
00:35:38.705 --> 00:35:40.205
As one Corinthians nine said,

657
00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:42.285
the gospel is more important than rights.

658
00:35:44.585 --> 00:35:45.605
You have the right to do that,

659
00:35:45.745 --> 00:35:48.805
but the gospel actually wins over that.

660
00:35:51.515 --> 00:35:53.495
And then there's that third question, more personally,

661
00:35:53.495 --> 00:35:56.135
what does this affect on my spiritual life?

662
00:35:59.775 --> 00:36:01.175
I don't think we've said this enough.

663
00:36:01.285 --> 00:36:04.695
Just because I can do something doesn't mean it's good.

664
00:36:08.795 --> 00:36:10.175
We need to ask does just

665
00:36:10.175 --> 00:36:12.255
because I can do this, does that mean it's good for me?

666
00:36:12.965 --> 00:36:16.195
Everything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial.

667
00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:24.935
See, that flow chart is how we can apply the mind of Christ

668
00:36:25.555 --> 00:36:28.695
to the thousands of decisions that we make every day

669
00:36:30.485 --> 00:36:32.585
to the decisions we make about our life

670
00:36:32.585 --> 00:36:34.465
and where we're gonna go and how we're gonna do these

671
00:36:34.465 --> 00:36:35.585
things here and there.

672
00:36:35.605 --> 00:36:40.055
How to use wisdom to see the limits

673
00:36:40.595 --> 00:36:42.615
of our freedom in the Lord.

674
00:36:45.645 --> 00:36:47.545
And here's where all this comes to

675
00:36:49.885 --> 00:36:51.865
in those freedom decisions,

676
00:36:53.035 --> 00:36:57.815
in those third level things, there will be a variety

677
00:36:58.885 --> 00:37:02.425
of ways that that plays out in the church among believers.

678
00:37:03.705 --> 00:37:05.325
We will make different decisions.

679
00:37:06.185 --> 00:37:08.885
We will see different conscience levels happen.

680
00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:14.045
This helps us maintain unity in humility

681
00:37:14.385 --> 00:37:17.285
and gentleness and patience and forbearance.

682
00:37:19.165 --> 00:37:22.015
This is what he has given us in his word.

683
00:37:23.355 --> 00:37:25.655
But that's gonna happen. There's gonna be differences.

684
00:37:25.955 --> 00:37:27.495
And that's where a lot of the debates come.

685
00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:30.815
And this is why I want to close the series with this today.

686
00:37:32.455 --> 00:37:35.035
See, we've spent a couple months building this theological

687
00:37:35.255 --> 00:37:40.125
jar, prioritizing the big rocks

688
00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:43.365
of our faith, the essential doctrines, those things

689
00:37:43.485 --> 00:37:45.685
that make us Christian.

690
00:37:49.475 --> 00:37:50.655
The problem comes though,

691
00:37:53.095 --> 00:37:57.175
whenever people will take those sand issues,

692
00:37:58.185 --> 00:38:01.655
those third level things, those Christian freedom ideas,

693
00:38:01.655 --> 00:38:03.215
those, those beliefs,

694
00:38:04.555 --> 00:38:07.295
and they will become more passionate about those

695
00:38:08.855 --> 00:38:12.465
than they do about the big rock doctrines

696
00:38:14.205 --> 00:38:18.705
and will start to debate the sand issues way more.

697
00:38:18.705 --> 00:38:20.385
We'll start to focus on

698
00:38:20.725 --> 00:38:24.145
and divide over these kinds of things.

699
00:38:24.245 --> 00:38:27.985
And we, we make these grains of sand seem really,

700
00:38:27.985 --> 00:38:29.265
really huge in the end.

701
00:38:34.005 --> 00:38:35.165
But here's what I wanna show you.

702
00:38:37.335 --> 00:38:42.305
What happens whenever we put the sand in our jar

703
00:38:43.315 --> 00:38:46.915
first, when we flip things

704
00:38:47.415 --> 00:38:51.115
and we start putting preferential items in the church in

705
00:38:51.205 --> 00:38:55.595
first we start putting Christian freedom ideas in first.

706
00:38:55.695 --> 00:38:59.515
And we put the sand as top line items.

707
00:38:59.665 --> 00:39:01.315
Like this is the most important thing.

708
00:39:01.315 --> 00:39:04.075
And that becomes the crux of the matter.

709
00:39:07.285 --> 00:39:09.185
We might even take these smaller rocks,

710
00:39:09.285 --> 00:39:11.305
the second tier issues, the things

711
00:39:11.305 --> 00:39:13.545
that we divide in churches over

712
00:39:13.545 --> 00:39:15.385
and we kind of have different denominations

713
00:39:15.645 --> 00:39:17.145
and and different churches.

714
00:39:17.325 --> 00:39:20.185
And we may even start questioning people's salvation if

715
00:39:20.185 --> 00:39:21.305
they're a part of a different church.

716
00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:24.625
And we put that stuff in even more importantly.

717
00:39:24.805 --> 00:39:28.625
And and then what happens to the big rocks?

718
00:39:31.525 --> 00:39:35.455
Okay, well of course we realize and no, these are important.

719
00:39:36.035 --> 00:39:40.615
Yes. And we might get a few of them

720
00:39:41.965 --> 00:39:45.645
into our jar, but then

721
00:39:48.015 --> 00:39:49.345
they don't all fit do they?

722
00:39:51.925 --> 00:39:56.335
Like you start to see like, by the way, the same amount

723
00:39:56.335 --> 00:39:58.295
of materials in that one as in this one,

724
00:40:00.035 --> 00:40:03.545
but they don't fit

725
00:40:05.235 --> 00:40:08.005
because it matters the order you put them in, right?

726
00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:12.555
If you put the big rocks in first,

727
00:40:12.975 --> 00:40:14.235
that's why we call this series.

728
00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:16.635
First things first, the most important things,

729
00:40:16.695 --> 00:40:19.315
the big rock items, we put them in first.

730
00:40:19.315 --> 00:40:20.595
They should always be first.

731
00:40:20.895 --> 00:40:23.795
And then we put the other stuff in around it and it fits.

732
00:40:26.795 --> 00:40:30.215
We can never take for granted the big rocks of our faith

733
00:40:30.215 --> 00:40:32.335
because they are the essential beliefs

734
00:40:32.335 --> 00:40:33.695
that make us Christian.

735
00:40:34.885 --> 00:40:38.575
They are the things that hold us all together. They will.

736
00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:42.055
They are things that will sustain us for if we focus

737
00:40:42.635 --> 00:40:45.695
on these less important matters as priorities,

738
00:40:45.695 --> 00:40:46.855
we're gonna get all wrapped up

739
00:40:46.855 --> 00:40:51.625
and divided those

740
00:40:51.865 --> 00:40:54.465
decisions people make and we get all worked up about that.

741
00:40:54.525 --> 00:40:56.265
The problem is that might cause us

742
00:40:56.285 --> 00:40:58.905
to end up losing the big rocks.

743
00:41:02.545 --> 00:41:05.005
May that never be so here, church.
