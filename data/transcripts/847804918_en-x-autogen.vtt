1
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.470
Well, good morning, faith family. It is a joy, man,

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.230
I tell you. Uh, it is really good to be back together again.

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.790
Uh, if you're new to our church, you might be wondering what's even going on,

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.430
like who this new guy is. Uh, I've been on sabbatical for the last three months.

5
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.230
My name's John Wolgemuth. I'm one of the pastors here. Uh, it has been a,

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.183
a good time.

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.870
I'll share more about that next Sunday about like kind of all of what happened

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.190
with the time of rest and what God taught me and showed me and challenged me

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.910
with. Uh, there were some, some really sweet times. We got to focus together.

10
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.830
My wife and I on each other got to focus on our time with our sons.

11
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.550
We got to travel a little bit. We got to do a lot of memory making things.

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.510
Just have a great time together and spend a load of time together, uh,

13
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.790
that we don't take for granted.

14
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.750
There are also some unique challenges in my soul, uh, that I did not anticipate.

15
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.510
And so, uh, I get to share more about that, uh, more deeply next Sunday.

16
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.550
But I do want to just start by saying a massive thank you to you as a church,

17
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510
uh, just for the time away. Uh, that,

18
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.470
that we feel so loved and supported and cared for,

19
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.670
that this is part of our policies as a church,

20
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.790
that every five years this gets to happen for my position,

21
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.190
for others on our staff. Uh, we get those every five years. Just that's,

22
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.710
that's something we care about one another so deeply and you support and love us

23
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.350
so well. We don't take that for granted. Uh,

24
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.190
that's a huge blessing for us to get to do that. So thank you. Uh,

25
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.270
what a blessing it is for that,

26
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.790
but also what a blessing it is to know that that like, you know, we,

27
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.790
we saw the Lord continue to work right through his word.

28
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.510
It was not that we left and everything shut down for three months.

29
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.670
It was God worked.

30
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.070
And so what a blessing it is to know how many faithful proclaimers of God's word

31
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.390
we have around here. It's just a gift to see that we have so many.

32
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.710
It's also a blessing, uh,

33
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.150
how much our staff and volunteers just continued on.

34
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.270
And we see that in fact,

35
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.070
things have grown and done well in the last three months.

36
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.030
What a blessing that is to me and to know that this is awesome,

37
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.350
to watch God work through his people. Now,

38
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.190
as you've already heard already today is what we are designating as Missions

39
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.550
Sunday. Really, if you've been around here at any length of time, you know,

40
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.670
pretty much every Sunday's mission Sunday, you know, and you are sent,

41
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.990
like that's who we are.

42
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.670
But with Perry coming on board and now some new opportunities we're seeing over

43
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.350
the next few weeks and months, we wanted to, to highlight that. Plus,

44
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.150
I've gotten asked a few times over the last week plus like, did I,

45
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.070
did I get any new vision or, or fresh word from the Lord on the time away?

46
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.030
Like is it,

47
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.390
is that's happened in the past before People go and they come back with

48
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.750
something different. It's like, did that happen? Well,

49
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.990
I'd have to answer that with a big fat no. Uh,

50
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.340
really there's nothing different about the direction that God is taking us.

51
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.220
We believe that that's been something he's affirmed over the last couple years.

52
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.100
We see we're gonna talk about it again today.

53
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.410
That direction and goal hasn't changed, but I,

54
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.210
I did sense some caution and I'll share a little bit at the end of the sermon

55
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.450
today about that. And so we'll get to that.

56
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.490
Once I walk through our mission again next week,

57
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.450
I'm gonna share about my sabbatical, what true rest really looks like,

58
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.290
which I think will be instructive for us as a church, as individuals.

59
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.730
Then the next week will be a,

60
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.530
a sermon on serving as we head into the fall before then August 13th,

61
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.340
promotion Sunday.

62
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.370
We're gonna begin just a slow walk through the Book of Colossians,

63
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.450
just verse by verse through the entire book for the fall.

64
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.970
So you can look ahead to that.

65
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.930
But today we need to recall our mission that aligns everything

66
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.130
we do as a church, from kids all the way up to senior adults.

67
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.210
What aligns us as a church, what do we do?

68
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.530
We're gonna recall our mission as a church today.

69
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.170
And so we'll start by turning together in God's word to Paul's letter

70
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.770
to the Ephesians. You can grab your copy God's word, turn to the New Testament.

71
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.730
We're gonna jump around a little bit from there. Uh, jump around a little bit,

72
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.970
but we'll start in New Testament in Ephesians chapter four,

73
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.570
Ephesians four. Now, I kind of briefly mentioned it,

74
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.010
but what do we mean when we talk about mission?

75
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.290
Talk about our mission as a church. What does that even mean?

76
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.610
And so here's another way to put it. When you think about the mission,

77
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.850
mission statement, whatever you wanna call it,

78
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.170
another way to put it is what has God called our church uniquely to do

79
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.490
that will shape us into disciple makers who go both locally and

80
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.523
globally?

81
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.040
What should drive our daily tasks?

82
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.960
Why we do what we do as a church? Why do we do that?

83
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.240
That's really a good summary of our mission. In fact,

84
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.120
God has inspired the book of Ephesians as a pretty good model for,

85
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.560
for a proper life orientation, ideal life orientation.

86
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.480
The Ephesians is a good way to go about looking at that cuz the first

87
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.800
three chapters of Ephesians highlights the glory of God in his nature.

88
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.200
Just who he is, what he's done in his, his self,

89
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.840
but then also how he saves sinners like you and me, how he builds his church.

90
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.800
It's all the first three chapters about how God works in the world himself,

91
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.693
who he is.

92
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.810
It records phrases over and over like to the praise of his glorious grace,

93
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.930
the father of glory. It says Jesus is far above all.

94
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.610
And then the way chapter three ends, it says to him,

95
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.970
be glory throughout all generations, forever and ever.

96
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.730
Like so that's the way the whole book starts. It says highlights.

97
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.940
This is who he is. Remember who he is. Don't forget who he is.

98
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.660
And so everything we do is under that umbrella.

99
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.460
Everything we do as a a church, everything we do as individuals,

100
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.500
it's all preeminently for his glory.

101
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.300
It's the way he designed it and he deserves it.

102
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.860
But then what chapters four through six do is they show us the

103
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.700
practical outworking of that nature of God,

104
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.660
of his glorious salvation in us, of his building, of his church. He,

105
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.180
he shows us, Paul shows us in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.

106
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.220
This is the way it should look when you go about your daily life.

107
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.050
That God's work in us changes us. It changes how we speak,

108
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.250
it changes how we sing. It changes how we give. It changes how we parent.

109
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.610
It changes how we work.

110
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.130
It even changes how we walk together in unity as a faith family.

111
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.570
The gospel, God's glory in salvation changes everything.

112
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.050
That's the context here as we get into Ephesians chapter four,

113
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.770
he's talking about that church setting verses 11 through

114
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.750
16. Look at it with me now. That's big number four in Ephesians.

115
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.310
Down under that, under that is little number 11.

116
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.450
He gave the apostles, this is Jesus. He gave the apostles, the prophets,

117
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.270
the evangelists,

118
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.050
the shepherds and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry,

119
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.890
for building up the body of Christ until we all attain to the unity of

120
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.890
the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to mature manhood to the

121
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.970
measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.

122
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.850
So that we may no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves and carried

123
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.530
about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning,

124
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.930
by craftiness and deceitful schemes.

125
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.840
Rather speaking the truth and love.

126
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.520
We are to grow up in every way into him who is the head into Christ,

127
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.820
from whom the whole body joined and held together by every joint with which it

128
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.580
is equipped. When each part is working properly,

129
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.540
it makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.

130
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.920
And so here you see why our mission statement begins with this phrase,

131
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.070
equipping one another. It's right here, right?

132
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.590
Equipping one another. What this verse is,

133
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.790
has said is that we are to make sure that each one of us is ready for God's

134
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:37.623
work.

135
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.760
And did you see how important it is for every one of us to be equipped and to be

136
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.520
utilizing the gifts that God has given us? You, you saw how important it is,

137
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.320
right? So that the entire church is built up, is unified,

138
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.140
is growing into Christ likeness.

139
00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.390
That's how important this is. What that means is that you,

140
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.070
if you have repented and believed in Jesus, in your place,

141
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.550
if you are a Christian,

142
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:11.830
God did not save you to sit on the sidelines that you

143
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.230
are called into his mission, into his ministry.

144
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.870
That means I need you. That means you need me.

145
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.160
That means you need each other.

146
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.060
That means every single one of us Christians,

147
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.260
every single one of us are mission critical.

148
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.450
We'll talk more about that in two weeks. But, but this is how important it is

149
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.400
without one another.

150
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.360
We don't build up into the stature of Christ.

151
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.820
Now that starts in just attending.

152
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.780
You can't build one up if you're never with one another. And I,

153
00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.060
I say that because I can't express to you how special that is to be back

154
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.260
together, how much I needed this, how much I needed my faith.

155
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.860
Family was never meant to do this by ourselves.

156
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.660
Now of course, it's nice to travel a little bit.

157
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.820
It was sweet to be visiting churches that my friends pastor locally or,

158
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.380
or even a little bit further away or,

159
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.220
or churches that we used to serve at before we go visit them and see family and

160
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.140
and friends there. But, but the way I compare it to,

161
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.060
and this is the only way I could think about how it felt was,

162
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.160
was like when you go visit extended family, you know,

163
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.720
like at Thanksgiving or Christmas or other events and you go see people like

164
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.560
cousins and, and extended out family that that, that you know,

165
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.240
you're connected to and, and you're in relationship with,

166
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.280
you know you love each other,

167
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.480
but you don't really have that same depth of relationship that you do with your

168
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:54.240
immediate family, right? You, you know, you're connected,

169
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.280
you know, you family, you know, you would sacrifice for each other,

170
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.240
but it's not the same as home, right?

171
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.980
And so Emily and I were talking about that even just last Sunday as we visited

172
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.580
friends down in Newcastle and, and it was great.

173
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.100
God's work is being done. We're proclaiming the gospel.

174
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.060
We're thankful for what he's doing through them. And, and, and we're in,

175
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.220
in full support of that. But we're sitting there thinking like,

176
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.380
this is not home to us.

177
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.310
Excited to get back here this week. Of course this is how much I needed this.

178
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.390
We need this.

179
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.670
That's why it was so sweet that I didn't jump right into just being here at the,

180
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:35.430
the offices and study all week. I jumped right into student camp this week.

181
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.830
Like so I was there with our students.

182
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.670
It was so sweet though because I got to,

183
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.270
to experience their joy in the gospel and be filled up by their passion

184
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:50.630
to participate in some coincidence with them and to be excited about all kinds

185
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.980
of things that we nobody, no nothing, nothing. No. Okay.

186
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.580
Um, but just to,

187
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.630
to to hear them passionately sing to the glory of God.

188
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.990
Man, it was so refreshing cuz I know them, I love them.

189
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.670
And then we're singing Together's a family, it was awesome.

190
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.050
And then to be back here with you today is so needed.

191
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.800
So when we talk about being the body of Christ together,

192
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.120
this is not just a bunch of disconnected parts.

193
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.720
This is a body meant to be together.

194
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.370
So don't don't miss out on that. Don't put it as a low priority.

195
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.660
So showing up is part of it. But you saw an Ephesians four,

196
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.940
there's so much more to it, right?

197
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.660
Getting into deep relationships with people and we do that through d groups and

198
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.820
community groups and Wednesday nights and,

199
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.920
and being equipped for God's work serving one another.

200
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.520
There's all kinds of things we'll see in a couple weeks, even d

201
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.630
equipped for God's work. But the question is,

202
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.640
what are we equipping each other for? Okay, equipped for God's work.

203
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.200
But what is it? What is it that we're equipping each other for?

204
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.160
Well first we have said it this way,

205
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.120
that it's equipping one another to love Jesus.

206
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.710
First and foremost, we're equipping one another to love Jesus.

207
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.740
Now, yes, we believe that God is three in one trinity, father,

208
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.240
son Holy Spirit. And Jesus said in Matthew 22,

209
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.440
you are to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind.

210
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:37.100
What we're doing in our statement by saying to love Jesus is we're clarifying

211
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.940
what our culture generically refers to as some kind of God but

212
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.100
doesn't know anything about him.

213
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.710
Because the God we worship is not just the man upstairs,

214
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.350
it's not just somebody out there, uh, a clockmaker setting it all in order. No,

215
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.430
we worship Yahweh,

216
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.770
the God who created everything,

217
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.930
yet the God who also became flesh and dwelt among us.

218
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.240
That's how we can know him. And that's,

219
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.680
that's radically different than every other religious system out there,

220
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.990
is that the God is not out there needing us to appease him. God came to us

221
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.490
this Yahweh who created everything. And that's,

222
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.010
that's great and we talk about that and we encourage one another with that.

223
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.890
But the reason we can love Yahweh,

224
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.810
we can love Jesus with all that we are is because of what we find in Luke

225
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.643
chapter seven.

226
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.700
So we're gonna turn left from where we were in Ephesians four or scroll up on

227
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.620
your device to the gospel according to Luke chapter

228
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.583
seven,

229
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.540
why can we say love Jesus in our mission?

230
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.000
Luke seven will start in verse 36.

231
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.890
And here's what we're gonna find. We're gonna find a pr,

232
00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.970
a prideful religious leader looking down on a woman who's known as a

233
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.970
sinner. He's looking down culturally and spiritually at this sinful woman,

234
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.000
but we're also gonna see her response to Jesus.

235
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.790
And then we'll see Jesus' response to her and by implication to

236
00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.390
this religious leader as well. But this is a powerful section.

237
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.070
Look at verses 36 through 50. Luke seven,

238
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.850
one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him and he went into the Pharisees

239
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.210
house and reclined at the table and behold a woman of the city

240
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.890
who was a sinner.

241
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.530
When she learned that Jesus was reclining at table in the Pharisees house,

242
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.690
she brought an alabaster flask, ointment.

243
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.250
So it would've been worth a lot of money.

244
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.290
And standing behind him at his feet weeping,

245
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.420
she began to wet his feet with her tears and wipe them with the hair of her head

246
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.420
and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.

247
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.980
And when the Pharisee who invited him saw this, he said to himself,

248
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.180
if this man were a prophet,

249
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.100
he would've known who and what sort of woman this is,

250
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.300
who is touching him for she's a sinner.

251
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.920
And Jesus answering. Remember that guy said that in his own mind,

252
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.560
Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you.

253
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.460
And he answered, say it teacher. And Jesus gives this parable. Verse 41,

254
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:37.340
A certain money lender had two debtors, one owed 500 denar I,

255
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.780
which is an incredibly large sum of money.

256
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.650
And the other 50 when they could not pay,

257
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.500
he canceled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?

258
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.380
And Simon answered logically the one I suppose for whom he canceled the larger

259
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.310
debt. Jesus said to him, you've judged rightly

260
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.070
then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, did you, do you see this woman?

261
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.360
I entered your house, you gave me no water for my feet,

262
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.280
but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.

263
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.010
You gave me no kiss. But from the time I came in,

264
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.850
she has not ceased to kiss my feet.

265
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.870
You did not anoint my head with oil, but she's anointed my feet with ointment.

266
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.550
Therefore I tell you her sins, which are many are forgiven for she loved much,

267
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.910
but he who is forgiven little loves little.

268
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.690
And he said to her, your sins are forgiven.

269
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.420
And those were who were at the table with them began to say among themselves,

270
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.300
who is this? Who even forgives sins?

271
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.470
And he said to the woman, your faith has saved you.

272
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.170
Go in peace. Is that not stunning?

273
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.020
You can just picture in your head, right,

274
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.260
how beautiful that scene would've been for her. How,

275
00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.300
how confrontational that scene would've been for Simon.

276
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.110
And listen, you might have walked in here

277
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.640
feeling just like that woman.

278
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.420
You might feel cast off from society.

279
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.560
You might feel too dirty, you've messed up too much, you're unlovable.

280
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.310
But see the extravagance of God's love in Jesus here,

281
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:39.780
like it's his love is not for those who pretend like they have it all together.

282
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:45.210
His love is for those who know they don't have it all together,

283
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.410
who know they're desperate without Jesus.

284
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.230
That's where his love flows out too.

285
00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.710
And understanding that leads to you to respond like she did.

286
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.940
Like when you remember how far from God you are on your own,

287
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.080
yet he saved you. That's when it overflows out of your heart.

288
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.920
That's when it overflows out of your mouth and you sing.

289
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.240
That's when it overflows out of your life to serve.

290
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.440
That's when it overflows out of your pocketbook,

291
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.840
out of your eyes when you're tearing up because you can't help but be grateful

292
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.700
for his salvation.

293
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.520
That's where it starts to come out of you is when you remember how far

294
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.600
from him you are on your own.

295
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:30.250
And yet he reached through the sin and said,

296
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.600
you're mine. Listen,

297
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.960
if Jesus is just a transaction to you,

298
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.680
like if he's just an add-on to your life so that you look better with your

299
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.360
friends or you look better at work,

300
00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.840
if that's all that he is, then of course you won't be passionate about him.

301
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.680
Of course you won't love him because he's just a little piece of your life.

302
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.240
But if Jesus is your very life,

303
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.620
if he is everything to you, if he's your only hope,

304
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.260
if he's the rock on which you build everything,

305
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.820
if you know he's redeemed you from all your sin,

306
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.460
that's when love abounds for Jesus.

307
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:18.720
It's bad news makes the good news that much sweeter. This

308
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:24.000
woman knew who she was. She knew what she'd done.

309
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.920
She knew what everybody had called her,

310
00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.600
but she also knew who Jesus was.

311
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.170
That's why she responded the way that she did.

312
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.020
Don't miss it. Church. She is every one of us,

313
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.730
every one of us, we're all far from God on our own,

314
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.690
we're all dirty, we're all messed up. But when we come to him for forgiveness,

315
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.290
that's when we can love.

316
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.610
And so we are called to equip one another to love Jesus. But,

317
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.530
but that's not the only thing he's called us to.

318
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.290
Because what can happen is if we just focus on that,

319
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.370
we just focus on our inner relationship with the Lord.

320
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.090
That's when we begin to get really self-centered and self-focused and inward

321
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.290
focused. We are also commanded all of our scripture to love others as ourselves,

322
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:21.730
to make disciples who make more disciples.

323
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.330
We're we're commanded by the Lord to do these things

324
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.720
as well as to love Jesus. And so we're, the way we summarize it around here,

325
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.720
you've heard it already today, is to live sent.

326
00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:38.890
We are equipping one another to love Jesus and to live sent,

327
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.810
that's also part of what he's called us to.

328
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.730
We're gonna see this over in Second Corinthians chapter five.

329
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.170
So you're gonna turn right now, not all the way to Ephesians,

330
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.870
but you're gonna go to second Corinthians,

331
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.630
another letter from Paul second Corinthians five verses 14 through 21.

332
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.860
We're gonna see this idea of living sent in second Corinthians five

333
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.220
14 through 21.

334
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.460
He's talking a lot about the future, our heavenly dwelling.

335
00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.800
But what he's now doing in this little section is he's going to show us

336
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.770
how that fleshes out into, as we wait,

337
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.410
as we're getting ready for the wedding supper of the lamb, like we sang earlier,

338
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:34.580
verse 14,

339
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:39.120
for the love of Christ controls us because we have concluded this.

340
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.280
That one has died for all. Therefore all have died. He died for all that.

341
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.000
Those who live might no longer live for themselves,

342
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:51.040
but for him who for their sake died and was raised from now on.

343
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.320
Therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh.

344
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.000
Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him,

345
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.920
thus no longer meaning he's, he's not in the physical form like he was before.

346
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.120
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.

347
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.740
Be old, has passed away.

348
00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:11.620
Behold the newest come and all this is from God who through Christ reconciled us

349
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.580
to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation

350
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.090
that is in Christ. God was reconciling the world to himself,

351
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:27.210
not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting to us the

352
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:31.870
message of reconciliation. Therefore, because he's given all this,

353
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.350
we are ambassadors for Christ,

354
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:39.830
God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ,

355
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.360
be reconciled to God for our sake. He made him to be sin who knew no sin.

356
00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.700
So that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

357
00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:51.910
Now, what I hope you see first

358
00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.550
is how gospel driven this is, right?

359
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.090
Like even our mission is centered on Jesus

360
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.770
reconciling work in our place on the cross.

361
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:11.220
Like so don't think they're separate like theology and study and then mission

362
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.740
like no, they're tied so tightly together right here.

363
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:20.420
But that good news is what compels us to live our lives every

364
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.690
day for him and for others to love.

365
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.850
Like he loved to share that message. It uses that word ambassadors to get the,

366
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.230
the idea across. Remember what an ambassador is,

367
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.190
it's an official representative of one nation to a foreign nation.

368
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.130
They share information, they build bridges of trust.

369
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.400
That's what we are here on this earth. Christians like,

370
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.480
remember we're citizens of heaven.

371
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.770
This is a temporary home and we are ambassadors to this temporary

372
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:54.830
place.

373
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.610
We have a message from the king to give to this nation and we have

374
00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:04.690
a, a set of values of the kingdom that we are to live out here on this earth.

375
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.550
And so that's the idea of being an ambassador of the king.

376
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:16.830
And so don't overcomplicate this, right? When we think about mission living sin,

377
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.710
don't overcomplicate it. Just look at how Jesus did it cuz Jesus came from the,

378
00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.470
the kingdom of heaven came to this earth, lived a certain way,

379
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.550
spoke a certain way.

380
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.550
Think about how Jesus did it and tried to do the things he did.

381
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:33.220
How he cared, how he spent time, how he loved how he gave,

382
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.660
how he served the old bracelet. What would Jesus do, right?

383
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.980
That actually kinda works here, right?

384
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:41.620
Like you can see this is how it plays out. What did he do? How did he do it?

385
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.870
Do that with your neighbors. Do that with your coworkers, with their family.

386
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:50.300
You can even do it cross-culturally right here in Edmond.

387
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.570
Remember the Afghan refugees that we help settle that believe in Jesus.

388
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.210
They've started a new church.

389
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.150
They're trying to reach their Afghan refugee friends, help 'em,

390
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:04.270
our Spanish brothers and sisters. They're,

391
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.150
they're trying to reach their community. Help 'em.

392
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.710
You got an ESL starting up here in a couple weeks. Go there.

393
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.590
There's primarily unbelievers from all over the world right there.

394
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.790
You can do this right here. The point is that both locally and globally,

395
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.590
you are to carry the ministry and message of Jesus reconciling work in your

396
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.950
place. Wherever you go, however you are, you don't lose the title ambassador.

397
00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.890
You are one. But again, church,

398
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.770
none of this is because we have to.

399
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.390
None of this is because we, we,

400
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.790
we see God will love us only if we do these things. No,

401
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.180
this is because we know God already loves us.

402
00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.180
This is a response to who he is and what he's done.

403
00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:54.220
He's saved us. He chose us out of the death of sin. He said, you're mind now,

404
00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:59.000
you're an ambassador of mine now and he's made us and notice that he's

405
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.160
made us into ministers of reconciliation.

406
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.840
He's made us into ambassadors.

407
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.410
And Craig said it really well this week in staff meeting. He said,

408
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.970
all we need to do now is just live out of who we already are.

409
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.880
That we are this. So,

410
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.640
so the focus is on being this rather than doing these things be

411
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:26.680
overdue. Right? See the difference there? You already are an ambassador.

412
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.080
You already are a minister, a me, a messenger of reconciliation.

413
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.040
So just be that more, just live out of it.

414
00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.790
Instead of focusing on just doing all these things,

415
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.460
be the physical presence of Christ, his hands and feet.

416
00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.860
We are the body of Christ doing what he would do. That's all it is.

417
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:50.200
Don't overcomplicate it. So that's still our mission,

418
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.430
church to equip one another, to love Jesus and to live sin.

419
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.760
That's where we're headed. But

420
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.780
even though nothing has changed, directionally goals,

421
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.980
see lives transformed in Edmond churches,

422
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.980
planted people sent all of these things. Nothing has changed their,

423
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.300
what may have changed

424
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.600
is how we are to go about it.

425
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:25.570
See where we live here in our area. There is a culture of,

426
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:30.770
of achievement and drive success.

427
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.770
All these things like there's, there's this, this undercurrent,

428
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:39.330
maybe even an over current of just pushing towards more and better and bigger.

429
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:46.440
It's sports. It's even in work, it's even in appearance. It's all over.

430
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:51.270
Which means it can seep into the church too.

431
00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.910
See, I think that's where I got, I think I got there a little bit.

432
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.350
I'll share more about this next week.

433
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.630
But I think I got to that place of drive and achievement

434
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.320
rather than what you're gonna see here in a second. Now. Now let's,

435
00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.440
let's be clear. God's commands are still God's commands, right?

436
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.200
There's still are what we are to do.

437
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.520
So we're not talking about what we are to do,

438
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.800
but what we need to remember is a caution in how we go about it.

439
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:28.170
The caution here is about how we actually pursue obeying

440
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.010
those commands.

441
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.050
Remember this caution as we go forward and we're gonna find one expression of it

442
00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:37.370
all the way back in Psalm 1 27.

443
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.580
So turn left way back into the testament.

444
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.180
Scroll up to the middle of your Bible or so, the book of Psalms,

445
00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.540
Psalm 1 27. You've been walking through the Psalms this summer.

446
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.620
We'll get to Psalm 1 27 in about eight years.

447
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.540
But if we're just gonna look at it for a glimpse here,

448
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.100
remember these psalms and prayers were meant for the worship gathering,

449
00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.280
right? That they're meant for,

450
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.680
for believers to sing together as they went to worship, to pray.

451
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.520
And so what we're gonna read here in Psalm 1 27, these first two verses is,

452
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:19.690
is meant to be a warning to the Israelites as they worshiped, as

453
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.910
they went about their lives, as they participated in worship.

454
00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:27.510
It was meant to be something as a, a warning to them.

455
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.550
We'll see it here in verses one and two of Psalm 1 27.

456
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:39.140
It says, unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain,

457
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.300
unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.

458
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.610
It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest,

459
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.680
eating the bread of anxious toil for he gives to his beloved

460
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.620
sleep. Now,

461
00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.420
when you look at this in its context,

462
00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:03.580
primarily it probably speaks of a literal building of a house in literal

463
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.660
protecting of a city.

464
00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.520
But notice it was included in what we call the Psalms of ascent.

465
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:16.500
Psalm one 20 through 1 34 were intended to be used by worshipers as they went up

466
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.780
to the temple in Jerusalem and they would say one every step up the steps as

467
00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.180
they went one 20 through 1 34, 1 20 sevens right in the middle of that.

468
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.660
So they're meant to be saying this as they're going to the temple to worship.

469
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.380
So it likely also applies then to the temple and to worship and to God

470
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.100
building his house spiritually.

471
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.650
Well then we think today we,

472
00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:45.650
we can pull that forward to apply it to us and to the church today in similar

473
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.160
ways. When we think about coming to worship,

474
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.440
we think about God building his house.

475
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.080
That's why I use it here as a caution to us as we go about our mission.

476
00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:00.780
Cause I heard it said one time that God can do more in five seconds than we can

477
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.900
do more in five years.

478
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:09.430
God can do more in five seconds than we can do on our own in five years.

479
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.980
Things that matter of substance. Here's what I mean. If we,

480
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.900
if we see this mission statement as something that we can

481
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:19.940
accomplish on our own

482
00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.040
or we see it as something that we have to try really hard to accomplish,

483
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.080
then we've missed it.

484
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.590
If we see that as a way that we've gotta end up trying harder and and using our

485
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.990
resources and our smarts and our strategies,

486
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.590
we're gonna end up burning out or we're gonna end up giving up.

487
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.870
Pride is a funny sin

488
00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.250
because pride will give God a shot for a while,

489
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.650
but then if he doesn't come through,

490
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.130
we revert back to leaning on our own strength really quickly.

491
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:59.930
But God here instead is saying in Psalm 1 27, that that,

492
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.730
imagine this house he's talking about is the church, big C church.

493
00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.610
What he says in Psalm 1 27 then is, it's his job to build it.

494
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:14.680
It's his job to build the church. Jesus said the same thing, Matthew 1618.

495
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.560
He says, I will build my church.

496
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.280
Now, do we have a responsibility? Yes,

497
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.560
like God ordains,

498
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.640
that that house is built by someone moving bricks and stones and it's happening.

499
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.720
He doesn't just poof right it, it happens through his people.

500
00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.640
So we have a responsibility to faithfully perform our task. Yes.

501
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:40.300
But it's ultimately his work, right? This is a spiritual work.

502
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.700
We can't manufacture that. It's his work. And man, listen,

503
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.540
that takes the pressure off, doesn't it

504
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.140
takes the pressure off.

505
00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:54.060
Because what it does is it frees us up to merely be faithful,

506
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.460
to merely be obedient,

507
00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.780
to be good stewards and to trust him for the fruit that he wants to produce.

508
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:07.750
Listen, we've gotta be really careful to not trust our resources,

509
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:12.550
to not trust our talents, our size, our influence,

510
00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:13.563
our history,

511
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:18.670
whatever it is to trust that stuff instead of trusting God to build his church.

512
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.150
Because this is what the end of Ephesians three says,

513
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:28.230
that he is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think

514
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.790
according to the power at work within us.

515
00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:33.590
To him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all

516
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.350
generations, forever and ever. Amen. Right?

517
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.550
He can do way more than we can try to figure out on our own.

518
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.680
But here's what that means. That means we better pray then, right?

519
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:52.260
That means when we talk about desperate dependence being one of our church's

520
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.250
values, how does that really show up here?

521
00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.000
Does it like, does that desperate depend? Is asking God to work?

522
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.760
Does that really show up? I mean, how many prayer meetings are really going on?

523
00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.050
Like if we say, God, we are desperate for you to move,

524
00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.610
but we're not gonna ask you, we're not gonna depend on you in any other way.

525
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:13.490
How is that matching?

526
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:18.370
How many of us are truly crying out to the Lord to do what only he can take the

527
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.330
credit for? Or do we just think this thing's gonna work,

528
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.970
this thing's gonna manufacture itself.

529
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.090
It's gonna happen because we have all these people,

530
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.010
we have all these staff members. We got all this money,

531
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.690
we got this building like we, it's gonna happen.

532
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.970
So we don't need to ask God for what? Where did that come from?

533
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:40.110
If these three months changed me in any way, it was in this area

534
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:44.500
like that, that we need to slow down more

535
00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:51.320
and just let God be God Instead of us trying to figure

536
00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:56.130
it out. Just let him do it. Cuz if he,

537
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.730
he doesn't build it, it's worthless. Whatever we build.

538
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:07.290
Speaking of changes, I hadn't been in this part of our building since April,

539
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.130
so you can imagine when I walked in here,

540
00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:14.210
it was like Franc from Father of the Blind. Hello. You know,

541
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:18.150
like big changes around here. So

542
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.750
here's, here's what I say that if you weren't here last Sunday, you missed out.

543
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.690
And we weren't here last Sunday morning,

544
00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:30.140
but we came last Sunday afternoon because when this building was built 20 years

545
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.860
ago, before they put anything down on the floors, it was just bare concrete.

546
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.460
They had the church come in and they had everyone write scripture and prayers

547
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:41.420
over this floor in Sharpies,

548
00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:46.930
just asking God to do something. Well,

549
00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:48.570
last week when we had the carpet ripped out,

550
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.220
before we put the new carpet back in,

551
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.550
it was so encouraging to walk around and see faint

552
00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.670
remnants. Sometimes you could read it, sometimes you couldn't.

553
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.230
But just scripture and prayer that people 20 years ago,

554
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.070
years ago had prayed over this building saying, God, we need you to move here.

555
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.790
If you don't move, we're we're just having a good time together.

556
00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.120
It's not worth it. It's not worth anything. And so you walked around,

557
00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.200
you could see right underneath the, the feet that you have right now,

558
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.160
like right there, people were writing scripture and prayers,

559
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.080
and I was overwhelmed as I thought about how we are standing here on the

560
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.920
shoulders of so many who've come and given and sacrificed and prayed and asked

561
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.080
God to work. This is not because we're awesome.

562
00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:36.840
It's because God for so many years has worked through this. And

563
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.253
then I,

564
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:44.140
I saw fresh sharpies all over here and all over there that some of you came

565
00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:49.140
back Sunday and wrote prayers and scriptures of fresh as you were praying for us

566
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:53.760
today, but also for those coming 20 years from now. And you're saying, God,

567
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.760
we need you to do something here. We need you to work.

568
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.560
That's all because of this. Psalm 1 27.

569
00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.560
We need God to do what only he can do.

570
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.890
We can't come up with a good enough strategy to change someone's life.

571
00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.920
We've got to remember that all of this is God's work, God's way.

572
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:17.640
This is God's church, God's way. This is God's mission, God's way.

573
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:22.240
This is all who we are as historically, Henderson Hills.

574
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:27.130
It's God's deal. We're gonna be that way going forward as well.

575
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:31.650
And so Psalm 1 27 doesn't mean stop working, stop giving,

576
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.530
stop building, stop guarding. It doesn't mean any of that.

577
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:38.700
It just means we recognize our limitations as we do those things.

578
00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.440
I'm not a good enough preacher to save anyone

579
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:49.250
to save the world. We're not good enough. Kids ministry, student ministry.

580
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:53.010
We're not good enough musically to do anything to change someone's life.

581
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:57.370
It has to be only God working through his means and his gospel

582
00:38:58.330 --> 00:38:59.310
to build his church.

583
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.880
But I also think it applies to us individually.

584
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.440
When you take stock of your day-to-day life,

585
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.540
how much of it looks like you forcing things through?

586
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:21.980
You're trying to make things happen again,

587
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.740
scripture values hard work.

588
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.860
So we're not abdicated from our responsibilities in life.

589
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.220
But how are you trusting yourself?

590
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.000
How are you trusting your money, your power, your position, your whatever?

591
00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:43.750
How does Psalm 1 27 show up in your life? Because listen,

592
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:48.670
you might be building your life on the shifting sands of what you

593
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.910
bring to the table yourself, your intellect,

594
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.590
your resources, your whatever,

595
00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.590
instead of placing your whole life in his hands

596
00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:06.410
and being faithful, being good steward, but just laying it in his hands.

597
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:10.330
But, but what it looks like in your life right now is that you're,

598
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:12.930
you're rising early. You're going to bed late.

599
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.010
You're working your fingers to the bone in worry and anxiety.

600
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.410
That's what it looks like for you right now.

601
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:23.090
What this says to us instead is just rest in him as his beloved.

602
00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:30.220
Rest in him, as his beloved. It's what our students learned all week that,

603
00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:32.940
that unless we abide in the vine of Christ,

604
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.610
then us as branches,

605
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.570
we're not gonna produce the fruit that God intends for us to produce.

606
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.230
We're disconnected branches trying to squeeze fruit out. It doesn't work.

607
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.240
It's gotta stay connected. As

608
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.700
long as we continue to depend on ourselves in our lives,

609
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.580
we are resigned to eating the bread of anxious toil.

610
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.340
Psalm 1 27 says,

611
00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:03.610
and all of our work notice three times it says in those two verses,

612
00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.950
we'll be in vain, fruitless, worthless.

613
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.620
You can build a life and it's worthless.

614
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:21.460
But when we're resting, when we're resting,

615
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:26.540
trusting we can afford to relax because God never does.

616
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.940
We can sleep because God's always active.

617
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:38.650
We don't have to create life because God is life.

618
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.560
Does that not bring utter humility before him?

619
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:45.130
Should that not foster some,

620
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.890
some humility that the fruit of our work is contingent on whether he's doing it

621
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:53.020
or not. Like don't forget that as you go about life,

622
00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:01.840
what this means is that we can be good stewards. We can, we can. Matthew Levin,

623
00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.000
his yoke is easy. His his burden is life.

624
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.800
We can just walk through life faithfully, stewarding it, being generous,

625
00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:10.080
being sacrificial, just a good steward,

626
00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.600
and trust him completely with the results.

627
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.400
It might not look like everybody else around you. Doesn't matter.

628
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:19.400
It's what God wants.
