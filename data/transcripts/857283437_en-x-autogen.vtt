00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.970
Welcome to Community Group Certification training.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.810
This is our first week in a seven week series,

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.130
and this is a practical and passionate and philosophical view

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.650
of community group ministry.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.890
And so we'll start off with a vision casting opportunity.

6
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.890
And I wanna start off with what I call the Lego principle.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.970
How many of you have played with Legos as a child?

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.250
And how many of you have got kids now,

9
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.610
or grandkids that build all kinds of things?

10
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.170
My granddaughters love Legos and never saw that coming.

11
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.690
But look at these incredible Lego projects behind me.

12
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.130
It's amazing what God can do with, uh, our designs,

13
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.570
the way he created us in his image,

14
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.410
if we'll work together and if we'll put our minds to it.

15
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.090
There's amazing things that we can do even with toys. If you think about it,

16
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.770
individual Legos are like people in our church. Like people,

17
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.970
Legos come in all different sizes and shapes and colors,

18
00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.010
and each Lego has a certain amount of snap-on points. Now,

19
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.930
every person who attends a community group also has a certain amount of

20
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.993
snap-on points.

21
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.130
And snap-on points represent time and energy and resources that

22
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.610
every individual has to give to their church.

23
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.610
Each person has a limited amount of time and resources and energy to give to the

24
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.890
church. And so, uh,

25
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.250
the longer an individual is involved in the church or in a community group,

26
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.570
the more and more snap-on points are taken up.

27
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.970
So a longtime church member may have a few or even zero snap-on points left

28
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.803
to give.

29
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.090
So what happens when a prospect joins a community group and needs

30
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.410
to snap on others in the class? Well,

31
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.130
if the community group members have no snap-on points to give away,

32
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.490
this lonely soul has no one left to attach to.

33
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.810
So if this new guest or prospect or this new community group member

34
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.450
remains lonely and detached and disconnected,

35
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.130
they're gonna become disgruntled and they may quit the class or quit the church

36
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.363
altogether.

37
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.250
They could believe and communicate to everyone who they see after having left

38
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.570
the class or the church,

39
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.490
that the community group or the church is unfriendly or even worse

40
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.490
uncaring. For this reason,

41
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.250
I wanna offer a practical and passionate approach to community group ministry.

42
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.730
And I want us to remember our five purposes of a community group. Number one,

43
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.770
reaching people for Christ. That's what we'll be talking about tonight. Also,

44
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.810
teaching people the Bible ministering to one another in this,

45
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.690
in the community group,

46
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.130
serving the Lord together as a community group and integrating the mission and

47
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.010
vision of our church as a community group.

48
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.730
These purposes work and they are good. We're good at ministering to one another.

49
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.610
It's very intuitive because the group loves to get together and build

50
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.530
relationships and share life together.

51
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.410
We're also very good at teaching people the Bible. Uh,

52
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.850
a community group that doesn't teach. The Bible doesn't get it. We

53
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.760
Are here to teach the Bible. This is key.

54
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.920
But the first purpose reaching people for Christ is often neglected.

55
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.960
It's not as intuitive. But listen to this.

56
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.120
Did you know that for every three unbelieving people enrolled in your community

57
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.120
group one will come to faith in Christ within a year? Did you hear that?

58
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.240
One out of three will come to Christ within a year?

59
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.120
Think about that for a moment. We wanna see people led to Jesus.

60
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.120
We wanna see people baptized doing his church.

61
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.360
We wanna see our church reach more people and grow in its influence and its

62
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.640
effective ministry. So the only way, one of the only ways,

63
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.320
the best way perhaps for us to do that is to increase the number of people in

64
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.480
our church. That means our community groups reaching people for Christ.

65
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.720
It works. It works 75 years ago and it works today.

66
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.480
Let me tell you a secret.

67
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.600
We have right at 60 adult community groups in our church right now.

68
00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.160
Some meet on Sundays, some on Sunday nights, some on Mondays,

69
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.080
some on Wednesdays, even some on Fridays.

70
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.760
But what what I need for you to understand is that we still have room for

71
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.120
more community groups. Maybe not on Sunday morning at nine or 10 30,

72
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.000
but at other times we must start new community groups.

73
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.120
It's true that community groups grow faster than those that have been meeting

74
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.960
for a long time. And if we start 10 new adult classes in 2024,

75
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.360
every one of them will grow and new classes grow fastest. It's a fact.

76
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.840
Now, we might not be able to start 10 new community groups in 2024,

77
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.120
but we could start with one.

78
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.400
And each of us leaders can do everything we can to promote the reality

79
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.240
that reaching people for Christ means multiplying our community groups.

80
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.760
We must grasp the vision of the Great commission.

81
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.760
Matthew 28, 18, 19 and 20 talks about authority.

82
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.160
The issue of authority is completely settled. Jesus said,

83
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.480
all authority has been given unto me. Therefore,

84
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.400
go and make disciples of all nations. We do include teaching,

85
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.960
but if we don't reach them for Christ,

86
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.120
there's no one to teach to observe everything that Jesus has commanded us.

87
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.200
It's a proven fact that starting new groups is paramount in church growth

88
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.380
strategy.

89
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.960
New groups involve more people and they have more relationships and they do more

90
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.800
ministry. So here is a simple proven formula.

91
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.480
New groups equals new people, equals new growth. It's simple.

92
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.760
It's not hard to figure out, and it it follows the commands of God.

93
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.760
Listen to what Jesus said in John three 16.

94
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.800
Whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.

95
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.280
One Timothy one, uh, two four, Paul said to Timothy about God, our savior,

96
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.173
he said,

97
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.400
he who desires all people to be saved and common to the knowledge of the truth.

98
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.720
And then there's two Peter three, nine.

99
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.400
The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness,

100
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.600
but is patient

101
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.600
Towards you. Not wishing that any should perish,

102
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.600
but that all should come to repentance.

103
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.960
So we must constantly remind ourselves that the church and the

104
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.200
community group is not just for us. In fact,

105
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.040
a more evangelistic or missional perspective is that we are here for those who

106
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.600
are not here yet,

107
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.600
it's God's will for Christians to reproduce themselves and to make disciples of

108
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.840
others. Disciples who make disciples,

109
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.760
who make disciples and it's God's will for churches to reproduce themselves and

110
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.640
start new mission churches. That's the vision of our church.

111
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.000
It's consistent to believe then that God intends for community groups to

112
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.520
reproduce themselves. Also,

113
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.320
community groups should experience the genuine meaning and

114
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.960
fulfillment in the fact that they have intentionally prayed and worked

115
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.440
to start and multiply a new group. Why multiply?

116
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.400
Because leaders will need to help their class members adopt this a philosophy

117
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.080
and understand it's a purpose of a community group,

118
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.440
not just to grow closer together in relationship,

119
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.560
but to grow closer together so that they can launch new believers and,

120
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.640
and not new believers, but new members into new groups and continue to multiply.

121
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.680
We will adopt that philosophy and we will adopt the purpose of multiplying new

122
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.160
classes. Now,

123
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.840
those who don't understand will resist this concept. In fact,

124
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.000
they don't know whether it will or will not make a difference.

125
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.880
And typically they can resurrect a story about a new community group that

126
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.713
failed,

127
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.880
but clearly it will make a difference because it provides opportunities

128
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.240
for others to become active and exercise the spiritual gifts that God has given

129
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.073
them.

130
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.040
If a community group teacher must ask himself whose gifts and

131
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.680
abilities are lying dormant in this community group, then uh,

132
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.600
it's poor stewardship of God's gifting the, uh,

133
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.360
kingdom minded community group Bible teacher must discover these dormant gifts

134
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.720
and then put them into service within the body of Christ,

135
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.640
specifically within their community group,

136
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.880
so that those gifts can be exercised and grow and become fruitful.

137
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.480
God did not intend for his children to waste the gifts that he has entrusted to

138
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.100
them,

139
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.000
and he certainly didn't intend for the church to deny people opportunities to

140
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.880
exercise God's giftedness.

141
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.560
I want to conclude our time together by looking at the threat of losing

142
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.320
evangelistic influence.

143
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.480
This is a passage in Matthew five 13 and 14 where Jesus is talking

144
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.400
about how it is possible for, uh,

145
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.640
his followers to lose their evangelistic influence. Now,

146
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.840
we can all agree these are turbulent times and uh, as,

147
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.200
as badly as any other time people need Jesus.

148
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.880
But as we navigate these turbulent

149
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.680
Times,

150
00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.360
a community group leaders must refocus their intention on captivating

151
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.560
the power of Jesus. And Jesus has said, uh,

152
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.760
I am with you always and that I will empower you.

153
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.280
You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea,

154
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.600
and the Holy Spirit will come upon you. But then I want you to take a,

155
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.560
a real quick look at these two metaphors that Jesus gave us in Matthew five 13

156
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.880
and 14. In Jesus', most famous teaching, he warned,

157
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.280
you are the salt of the earth.

158
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.360
But if salt lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?

159
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.320
It's no longer good for anything but that he thrown out and trample under

160
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.153
people's feet.

161
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.400
So Jesus is saying that tasteless salt is,

162
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.240
it's a risk of losing our distinctiveness as the Christians that God is

163
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.640
creating us to be. Jesus taught the threat of becoming tasteless.

164
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.240
Salt is real. And when we conform to the world's standards,

165
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.520
when we compromise our core values,

166
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.360
when we find ourselves comfortable with our surroundings,

167
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.160
we lose our distinctiveness and we lose our opportunity to make a real impact in

168
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:03.993
the world.

169
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.000
It weakens our ability to spread the transformative message of the gospel

170
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.320
of Jesus Christ. You know, salt in ancient times was a preservative,

171
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.840
but it was also a flavor enhancer.

172
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:22.200
And Christians like salt are called to preserve and called to enrich

173
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.040
the moral fabric of society and reflect the glory of Jesus to people who need

174
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.520
him. The second metaphor that Jesus used was hidden candles.

175
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.360
And this is the danger of diminished visibility.

176
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.200
Jesus continues in verse 14 and 15, and he said, you are the light of the world.

177
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.680
A city on a hill cannot be hidden,

178
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.640
nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand,

179
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.960
and it gives light to all the house. You see, light serves as a guide.

180
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.600
It dispels the darkness and it reveals truth.

181
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.680
And Jesus compares Christians to candles.

182
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.640
They're meant to shine brightly in a world and a world that's shrouded by

183
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.913
spiritual darkness.

184
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.680
The danger of hidden candles lurks as community group groups

185
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:12.560
give into contentment or apathy or complacency and don't

186
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.680
realize what God is calling them and creating them to do.

187
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.520
When the light of Christ is within a believer,

188
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.360
when it dems the impact of our evangelistic opportunities diminish,

189
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.480
we must rekindle the flames of passion and courage.

190
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.760
We must position ourselves as beacons of hope and truth,

191
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.920
unafraid to shine the light for all to see.

192
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.320
May we continue to shine as beacons of light,

193
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.360
creating new community groups that will shine ever brighter,

194
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.640
impacting the lives and beaming light ever brighter on our spiritual journey.

195
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:52.080
May we serve Jesus with heartfelt gratitude and a vision for an even

196
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:52.800
brighter future.
