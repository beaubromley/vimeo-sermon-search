1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.700
Who is the god like Yahweh the

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.900
god of wrath the god

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.300
of Mercy The God Who

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.400
reaches down to unworthy people.

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.200
Well, good morning again beloved. It is a great to be

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.600
together worshiping the Lord with our

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.400
lives as long as well as how we sing and

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.200
praise together. If I haven't met you

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.300
yet. Please come say hello to me. I'd love to meet you. I love being

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.500
a pastor not just a preacher. And so I'd love to engage and

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.100
interact with you if I can we're nearing the end of

12
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
our journey through the Old Testament Book of Micah. And so if

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.400
you haven't been here, we're coming to the end. It's kind of sad that

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.900
that next week will be the last sermon in this series what

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.800
that also means we're gonna get a little more formal around here. If

16
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.200
you know what that means from the past I'd like for

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.900
more than four of you to engage that with me if you would but anyway,

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.800
we're gonna be Micah 7 today.

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.100
Micah 7 versus 11 through 17. So take your

20
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.600
copy of God's word turn there with me.

21
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.600
Micah 7 11 through 17

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.100
everyone loves a good rags to riches story, right?

23
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.300
You know like those movies where somebody down their

24
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.800
luck makes it the big time and has a lot of success things

25
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.000
like Pursuit of Happiness.

26
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.600
Or Slumdog Millionaire, maybe go

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.800
a little older Cinderella. It's kind of one of those or My

28
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.300
Generation Mr. Deeds actually was one anyway also

29
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.600
for you Hallmark movie fans. You might

30
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.000
recall this one plot line where the small

31
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300
town waitress Waits on

32
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.100
the New York City lawyer who's car broke down

33
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.700
after he took a wrong turn and then Slayer that

34
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.300
evening happened to see her across the courtyard at the Christmas tree

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.400
lighting and and then he saw her

36
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.500
at the family's Bakery the next day and then he ends up

37
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.200
falling in love with her after cutting firewood with her

38
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
dad and then they end up buying

39
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.500
the bed and breakfast that they end up making scones together for

40
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.400
the rest. It's so beautiful.

41
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.200
I could get through it. Okay.

42
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400
No, really. There's a

43
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.200
good movies because you already know the end right? So you already know what's coming which is actually

44
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.200
the point of the sermon by the way, but it's a whole others.

45
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.700
but

46
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.400
Seriously, though. There are also the real life stories like

47
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.900
bitty Mason.

48
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.300
Known as grandma Mason who was

49
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.500
born a slave in Mississippi, but one her freedom

50
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.300
in California in 1856 became one

51
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.900
of Los Angeles's first black land owners eventually

52
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.300
amassing a fortune through real estate.

53
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.200
Generously giving away to the poor and helping Finance the

54
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.200
founding of the city's first black church.

55
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.700
And so why do we love stories like that these Rags

56
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.300
to Riches? Why do we love those?

57
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.400
Because deep down we all know that things are not the

58
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.400
way they're supposed to be in the world right now.

59
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.400
Like we want we want to fix we want restoration. We

60
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.200
feel empty because creation is not as it once was

61
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.400
back in Genesis 1 and 2.

62
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.800
And creation is not the way it's going to be someday. And so

63
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.600
we want we want to be restored. We see the evil and

64
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.200
the wickedness in the world around us and we want it to be gone.

65
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.200
We also don't have that relationship with God like they had

66
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.700
back in the garden Adam and Eve Walking face to

67
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.200
face with God. We don't have that anymore. And so we

68
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.000
want restoration.

69
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.500
We want our lives to be perfect again because they're not

70
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.900
right now.

71
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.000
And so what do we do with that we?

72
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.200
We tend to try to manipulate and control things to get

73
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.600
them to be perfect for us.

74
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.000
At least our perception.

75
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.200
Or we turn to substances or to experiences to to

76
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.600
try to fill the emptiness that we feel in our

77
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.800
souls.

78
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.700
Actually what we're going to see today in Micah 7 is the

79
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.700
culmination of everything we long for.

80
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.500
It's it's the end of everything. We've been seen building

81
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.400
throughout Micah. We've seen it now today come to

82
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.400
this place where this is the restoration we see in long for

83
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.900
it's finally come.

84
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.300
We'll see it look at Micah 7 verses 11 through

85
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.600
17.

86
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.200
A day for the building of your walls in that

87
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.500
day the boundary shall be far extended.

88
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.600
In that day, they will come to you from a Syria

89
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.300
and the cities of Egypt from Egypt to the River from

90
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.700
sea to Sea Mountain to Mountain.

91
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.300
But the Earth will be desolate because of its inhabitants.

92
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.700
for the fruit of their deeds

93
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.700
Shepherd your people with your staff the flock of your inheritance

94
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.100
who dwell alone in a forest in the midst of

95
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.000
a garden land.

96
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.000
Let them graze and Bichon and Gilead as in the days of old.

97
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.800
As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things.

98
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.200
The Nations shall see and be ashamed of all their

99
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.100
might they shall lay their hands on their mouths their ears shall

100
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.600
be deaf.

101
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.200
They shall lick the dust like a serpent like The Crawling things of

102
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.400
the Earth.

103
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.900
They shall come from trembling out of their strongholds.

104
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.300
They shall turn in dread to the Lord Our God and they

105
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.900
shall be in fear of you.

106
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.500
So he mentions that the at the start here a couple of times this day

107
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.200
he's talking about.

108
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.300
What's the same day? He's been talking about throughout the book that there's

109
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.900
there's a day coming when the Messiah King returns in

110
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.500
Victory. That's the day future for him still

111
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.100
future for us when Jesus returns victoriously.

112
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.500
So what he's talking about here is what will happen when that Kingdom

113
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.100
fully comes.

114
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.800
He's looking future. He's telling us to look future. What's

115
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.900
going to happen when God's kingdom fully comes.

116
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.300
Now again, as we've said throughout this series there's an already but not

117
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.000
yet nature to God's Kingdom.

118
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.200
Where in a sense since Jesus has come and

119
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.100
done all that he's done. It already has come for those

120
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.400
who have trusted in Jesus as their King

121
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.400
and savior have been brought into his kingdom. Yes, the kingdom

122
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.600
has come but it also has not yet

123
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.800
fully come.

124
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.500
Because God does not reign in every human heart yet.

125
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.300
And we look around and we see things look like

126
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.300
God doesn't Rule and Reign Over them. They're a mess.

127
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.600
It's broken. And so we know the kingdom has not yet fully come but

128
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.200
one day as we see here one day it will versus

129
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.800
8 through 10 promised last week the victories

130
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.900
coming.

131
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.400
God will win. This is what it's looking forward to

132
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.100
see what will happen when he does.

133
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.400
What will happen when the kingdom fully comes?

134
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.200
Here's what we see first. We see God flips the script.

135
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.100
God flips the script

136
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.100
It's actually what verse 11 indicates first. It's

137
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.300
that remember a Syria was

138
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.400
the nation that was pressing in on Judah at this time. And so they're

139
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.200
chewing up judah's land as they're pressing

140
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.300
into Jerusalem as the final prize.

141
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.200
They're taking all of judah's land. What once was

142
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.300
Judah once was Israel. They're taking it all and

143
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.000
all that's left is basically Jerusalem.

144
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.000
But one day this says that day.

145
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.900
Judas borders will be extended.

146
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.500
Judah will actually grow Judah will

147
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.400
actually expand its boundaries because so many

148
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.700
people are flowing into God's land.

149
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.300
So that's one flip. We see another flip. We see in verse 13.

150
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.400
Is that where these nations like Babylon and Assyria the

151
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.300
ones that were oppressing God's people Babylon in Assyria.

152
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.700
They were crazy wealthy. They seemed successful. They

153
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.500
would already be known as the most powerful Nations on

154
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.300
Earth. They seem like they had it all together, but they

155
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.700
would be made desolate it

156
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:16.800
says

157
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.700
They will be made desolate that word desolation has been used throughout Micah

158
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.000
right as a sign of judgment.

159
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.200
That God would make those who opposed him

160
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.500
a desolation empty.

161
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.800
But notice he says why it would be because of

162
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.000
its inhabitants.

163
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.600
for the fruit of their deeds

164
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.200
Basically, it just means you reap what you sow.

165
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.100
Sin has Eternal effects. God will not

166
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.100
just sweep it under the rug. There is a just God

167
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.900
there and so he's saying no I'm going to do something about that.

168
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.200
And for those who turn away from God.

169
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.100
Even if they seem successful, even if they seem wealthy all

170
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.600
put together everything is in order.

171
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.200
Even if they are that way if they turn away

172
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.000
from him, they will receive his judgment.

173
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.300
They'll be made a desolation. He says.

174
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.800
It's also what verses 16 and 17 allude to.

175
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.000
Where those who were once taunting Yahweh. Remember

176
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.100
last week verse 10, you're like, where's the Lord your God

177
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.100
like or we're coming in just mowing people down. No matter

178
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.100
what their God is. He's like, where's the Lord your God to come in

179
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.800
the taunting Yahweh taunting Judah.

180
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.200
Now it says they'll be made mute.

181
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.500
These wealthy powerful strong taunting

182
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.400
Nations will be made mute and

183
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.100
deaf. God will flip the script on them and

184
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.100
make them instead a riches to rag story.

185
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.400
That they thought they had it all together. They thought they were strong. They thought they

186
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.300
were where they should be and God makes them actually

187
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.100
bite the dust like the serpent in Genesis 3.

188
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.000
That's what it says here lick the dust like that where they're gonna be

189
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.000
trembling. They're gonna be afraid they're gonna be put underneath his heel.

190
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.700
That will finally see what they've been denying their entire lives that

191
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.500
there really is one true God out there. His name is Yahweh.

192
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.200
Now we can look at this from our side 2700 years

193
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.000
later and we can say

194
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.600
Well, that's that's trouble for them course a

195
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.300
Syria would be judged a course Babylon would be judged but but let's not

196
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.400
leave this in the Old Testament.

197
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.500
Let's bring this to today and ask the question.

198
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.700
Where do you stand in all of this?

199
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.900
because God is still just

200
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.800
God still says he's going to judge sin.

201
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.400
So you have to ask the question. Which direction is

202
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.100
your script going to be flipped here?

203
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.100
Because yes for for Judah.

204
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.600
Their script is going to be flipped and they were going to be expanded. They were going to have all the

205
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.600
safety and protection all those things that they needed. Yes, praise God

206
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.300
for that flip of a script that what we are

207
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.200
oppressed and downcast and Cast Away like that's gonna

208
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.900
be made in in all of God's ways righteous. Okay,

209
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.300
great.

210
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.600
But there's also the other way.

211
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.400
It's what we see here.

212
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.500
That you might think you have it all together.

213
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.100
You might think that you are doing exactly what

214
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.800
you and listen. You can be in church your entire life and be this way.

215
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.200
You're doing everything right? You got all the money you need you you got a

216
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.100
family put together the way you want it. You've got your business put together the way you want

217
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.200
it everything is exactly as you think it is and everybody looks at you like

218
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.400
you are the one that has the standard.

219
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.600
but if you are turning away from God

220
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.100
If you have stiff armed God and said I don't want anything to

221
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.800
do with you even though I'm going to be a religious person because it's gonna get me what I want.

222
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.100
But in your heart you've never said Jesus you are

223
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.700
my Lord. You are my king and my savior he is going

224
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.100
to judge you as well.

225
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.700
If you stand in opposition to God, he will bring judgment

226
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.200
in your life.

227
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.900
He flips the script.

228
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.700
when his kingdom comes

229
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.300
He exalts The Humble. He humbles the exalted.

230
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.500
It's what he does.

231
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.500
But there is something interesting about this.

232
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.100
Yes, he's going to judge the Nations that turn away from him. He's going to judge the

233
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.200
people that turn away from him.

234
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.200
But he hasn't fully forgotten the Nations, right?

235
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.200
You see this here?

236
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.300
He even draws the Nations.

237
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.000
at the same time

238
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.300
He also draws he's judging but he's

239
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.300
also drawing look at verse 12 again.

240
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.900
In that day again this day that's coming forward. They

241
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.700
will come to you.

242
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.900
Micah is saying this to God they will come to you from Assyria

243
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.500
the nation's oppressing them and the cities

244
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.400
of Egypt where they came from and from Egypt

245
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.500
to the River from sea to Sea from Mountain to Mountain basically from

246
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.000
the entire Earth. They will come

247
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.200
It's the same thing if you remember you've been tracking through this series with us that

248
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.700
God promised back in Micah chapter 4.

249
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.500
Where he was previewing the delivered city of Jerusalem up

250
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.000
on this mountain again, that was desolate.

251
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.000
He says no, it's actually gonna be redone. Here's what's going to happen. It's going to

252
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.500
look like this and so look at Chapter 4 verses 1 and 2.

253
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.700
It shall come to pass in the latter days again day

254
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.200
that the mountain of the house of the Lord

255
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.100
shall be established the highest of the mountains. It should be lifted up

256
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.200
above the hills and peoples.

257
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.500
Not just people like generic humans peoples. That's

258
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.400
Nations. That's languages that's people groups.

259
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.000
Shall flow to it.

260
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.700
and many nations shall come

261
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.100
and say come let us go up to the mountain of the Lord

262
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.500
to the house of the god of Jacob that he may teach us his path is ways.

263
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.500
We may walk in his paths.

264
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.100
So this idea that God is going to in the

265
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.600
end. Bring Nations to himself people to

266
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.200
himself is just the

267
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.000
Fulfillment of something. He's promised for the whole book the

268
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.500
whole time.

269
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.600
Even back to Genesis 12 when he chose Abraham and

270
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.500
he then chose Israel as well through Abraham.

271
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.300
He says I've blessed you to be a

272
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.200
blessing to the nation.

273
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.200
From the beginning of Israel's history. God said I've

274
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.300
blessed you to be a blessing to all the peoples of the Earth.

275
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.800
From the beginning God had a greater plan for his people

276
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.500
for the whole world.

277
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.500
That his Blessing was not exclusive to one family, but it

278
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.200
was actually for the Nations.

279
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.300
See his choice of Abraham was an end in itself.

280
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.800
Yes that God shows Abraham, but it was also at the

281
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.300
same time a means to an end.

282
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.300
That Abraham's election was for mission.

283
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.700
God shows Abraham for the purpose of blessing

284
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.900
all the Earth.

285
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.200
And that's that's part of the call he gave

286
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.500
to Abraham. So that means for us how does this work out for us as the

287
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.500
church? That means the church should not

288
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.400
see the mission of God as an add-on to

289
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:31.800
its work.

290
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.000
I think for so long many Christians have seen this

291
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.600
is what we do. We come to church we study

292
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.500
the Bible we sing we do our Sunday school thing

293
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.200
and that's good. Just the mission is those people over

294
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.200
there those superhero Christians? Keep it over there. Just don't

295
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.300
get in our way and we'll support you but just this is this

296
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.600
is what we do. That's what you guys do.

297
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.600
but actually

298
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.100
The mission is part of what God called Abraham to

299
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.900
do. It's part of what he's called us into it's

300
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.900
what Isaiah heard from God Isaiah. 49:6.

301
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.300
God says to him. It's too light a

302
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.200
thing that you should be my servant to raise up just the tribes of Jacob and

303
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.100
bring back The Preserve of Israel. I will make you as a

304
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.900
light for the Nations.

305
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.200
That my salvation May reach to the end of the Earth.

306
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.500
What he says to Isaiah is not enough that he

307
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.300
would get Israel back.

308
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.800
Great. Yes, but it's not enough. He's

309
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.000
after the Nations, too.

310
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.600
It's all over Micah. It's all over the prophets.

311
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.400
It's in jesus' Great Commission mandate at

312
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.400
the end of Matthew 28 to make disciples of

313
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.800
all Nations at the end of Acts. 1:8 Jerusalem,

314
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.300
Judea Samaria. The ends of the Earth. This is

315
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.300
from the very beginning. It's what God has had

316
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.800
in mind for his people.

317
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.100
To go to the Nations and it all culminates in this.

318
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.500
It culminates in what?

319
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.900
the Apostle John saw

320
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.800
in the Book of Revelation

321
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.900
So we're looking at this day right in Micah. We're looking at the day that Messiah

322
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.100
returns John got a glimpse of

323
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.600
what it looks like.

324
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.500
On the other side of this thing. He said I here's what I see. Here's what I'm

325
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.300
seeing happen in heaven right now that

326
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.500
it's going to be that way forever.

327
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.200
John got a glimpse into that. We're in Revelation

328
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.500
5 9 and 10. He heard them sing this song to

329
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.400
Jesus worthy. Are you to take the scroll

330
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.400
to open its seals for you were slain by your

331
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.500
blood you ran some people for God from every tribe

332
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.500
and language and people and nation and you've made them a

333
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.200
kingdom and Priests to our God and they shall

334
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.000
reign on the Earth.

335
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.200
Continuous chapter 7 verses 9

336
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.300
and 10. He looked again and he saw this picture of the throne room

337
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.600
of Heaven. He said I looked and behold a great multitude. No

338
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.400
one could number from every nation from all

339
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.100
tribes and peoples and languages standing Before the Throne before the

340
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.600
lamb clothed in white robes palm branch in their hands crying out

341
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.300
with a loud voice salvation Belongs To Our God

342
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.700
who sits on the throne to the lamb.

343
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.600
This is what heaven looks like.

344
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.600
This is God's heart for the nations from

345
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.400
the very beginning. He's always had that mindset.

346
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.800
He's always been drawing people including us.

347
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.700
Who are not ethnic Israel?

348
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.700
He's he's drawing Nations to himself.

349
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.300
And it culminates as Micah looked forward as

350
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.700
John got to see culminates in a representative from every

351
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.500
nation at the end.

352
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.800
This is what God's heart shows us.

353
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.200
It's not just about those people. It's about.

354
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.100
The Nations not just about us. It's about them as well.

355
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.200
There's one more piece of Micah 7.

356
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.600
That will happen when God fully inaugurates his kingdom. He will

357
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.500
Shepherd his people.

358
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.200
It's the last piece of this is that he will Shepherd his people God Shepherds

359
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.300
his people.

360
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.900
And we see this in verse 14 in Micah 7.

361
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.200
This is Micah praying to God. He says Shepherd your

362
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.500
people with your staff.

363
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.700
The flock of your inheritance who dwell alone in a forest

364
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.700
in the midst of a garden land let them graze in

365
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.300
Bichon and Gilead as in the days of old.

366
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.500
another flipping of the script here

367
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.100
where Micah prayed that God would Shepherd his people

368
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.500
out of the ashes into the beauty.

369
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.000
because remember

370
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.100
in Micah's day God's remnant of believer's we're in

371
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:52.700
a really tough spot.

372
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.400
A serious pressing in they were surrounded

373
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.400
out there by fertile ground, but they were living

374
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.600
in scrub basically.

375
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.300
Because that word you saw it there who dwell

376
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.600
alone in a forest that word Forest don't think the Hobbit like

377
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.300
lush green forestry. That's not it.

378
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.000
It's actually more like West Texas scrub.

379
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.500
That's the image we get from this word which

380
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.500
brings with it this idea of lonely deprived.

381
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.600
Empty, there's nothing.

382
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.200
That's why Micah intercedes here and prays asking God

383
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.100
to restore the lusciousness of the

384
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.500
pastures of of these cities Bichon and Gilead which

385
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.100
were right on the other side of Jordan River. That was the entry

386
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.200
into the promised land for God's people.

387
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.200
So he's like God give us that back. We enjoyed that

388
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.000
for many years right off the bat how milk flowing honey

389
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.000
flowing like this was incredible look at

390
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.700
the wheat and look at all this stuff that we can have God restored

391
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:53.900
again.

392
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.700
We have scrub now.

393
00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.200
Restore us God.

394
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.600
But here's what that gives us a glimpse into.

395
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.800
part of God's judgment on his people

396
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.300
as his people turned away from him and

397
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.100
turned to idols and all these other things part of God's judgment was to

398
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.600
turn the promised land into a wasteland.

399
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.200
What they had was so beautiful and nice and they said all right,

400
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.100
but we want this stuff over here God instead of you and he just said, all right,

401
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.200
here's what this is gonna look like.

402
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.200
turned into a wasteland

403
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.200
yet.

404
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.300
God will one day reset that

405
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:34.800
promise.

406
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.300
To bring back Beauty bring back joy, and he'll do

407
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.200
it. He says through the image of a shepherd.

408
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.200
Right see that verse 14 this image of a Shepherd. It's been

409
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.200
all throughout Micah.

410
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.900
If you remember back to chapter 2.

411
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.600
God said, he's the king going out before his

412
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.100
people and he's Gathering them like a sheep

413
00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.800
in a fold.

414
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.200
If he's the standard bear in front of his people and then

415
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.500
in verse four of chapter 5 that was The Prophecy

416
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.900
of the Messiah coming and he's going to be a Shepherd standing in

417
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.400
shepherding in the strength of the Lord his flock.

418
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.800
And we know both of those point to Jesus.

419
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.100
But what does this reveal about God this idea of a Shepherd if that's

420
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.300
how he's going to bring about?

421
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:23.700
this day

422
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.300
What does it reveal about him? What do we see God's heart

423
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.600
here. Well first we see that his heart is to provide.

424
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.500
for his flock

425
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.200
He turns the barren Wasteland into a beautiful

426
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.400
pasture land again.

427
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.900
Takes Beauty out of the ashes. He provides

428
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.200
for his people but it also shows he covers his people

429
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.600
with protection. That's the image of the staff.

430
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.200
That God possesses this powerful authority to protect

431
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.200
his people.

432
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.800
So many people love Psalm 23 quoted at

433
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.300
all kinds of things.

434
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.200
But verse 4 says even though I walk through the valley the shadow of death.

435
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.700
I will fear no evil for you or with me your rod

436
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.500
and your staff they comfort me.

437
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.400
That's how it's comforting is because I know God you can protect me

438
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.300
with those things as a sheep. The shepherd would

439
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.800
lean on that Shepherds Authority and

440
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.200
ability to protect them from wolves and to keep

441
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:26.700
them safe.

442
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.100
Same thing.

443
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.200
Shepherd your people with your staff

444
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:33.800
with protection

445
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.200
But then there's a third aspect the shepherd.

446
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.200
Portrays this intimacy with his people here.

447
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.300
Did you see what Micah says in verse 14? He says Shepherd your

448
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.600
people God.

449
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.300
the flock of your inheritance

450
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.600
There's a there's an intimacy there's a personal connection

451
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.700
that he is longing to have restored again.

452
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.400
Like they lost in the garden and Genesis 1 and

453
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.200
2 Adam had it Genesis 3, they lost it what he's

454
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.300
now long before God. Give us your presence again. We want

455
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.300
to be back with you again want to be your people again?

456
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.200
well

457
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.900
again, we're looking forward to a day.

458
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.200
When that becomes a reality.

459
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.000
which John saw Revelation 21 verse 3

460
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.200
he heard a loud voice saying Behold The Dwelling Place of

461
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.600
God is with man.

462
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.500
He will dwell with them. They will be his people God himself

463
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.500
will be with them as their God. That's

464
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.200
what he's longing for. Is this restoration of the

465
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.500
relationship face to face with the holy God. That's what he wants. He

466
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.800
Longs that Shepherd to be with them.

467
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.200
And so as we come to this point in spite of all the

468
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.300
Carnage and the mess we've seen throughout the

469
00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.300
Book of Micah, right?

470
00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.500
It's just it's been so hard to watch people turn away and

471
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.300
turn away and be judged and brought back and turn

472
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.900
away and the cycle of Doom and judgment coming back.

473
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.600
over and over again

474
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:13.800
yet.

475
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.200
Is this not a beautiful picture?

476
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.100
Of what God is going to bring with him one day.

477
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.300
as the king returns

478
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.200
to restore all things where he makes his people

479
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.200
the perfect rags to

480
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.000
riches story.

481
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.200
Is this not a glorious Grace To Us

482
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.400
Church?

483
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.300
That this is what God is bringing.

484
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.200
Out of the mess the Micah was in out of the mess that we live in

485
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.900
God is going to restore.

486
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.100
So, what should we do now?

487
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.700
What do we do now?

488
00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.300
Because no matter what Nostradamus says this thing

489
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.000
hasn't happened yet.

490
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.600
Right. This is still coming.

491
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.800
The full restoration the full inauguration the

492
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.700
kingdom is still future. So what do we do until then? How

493
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.100
do we respond to this knowing? This is coming. What do we

494
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.500
do now?

495
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.100
First Trust God's plan

496
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.300
You got to just trust God's plan and all

497
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:23.500
of this.

498
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.000
Because think Micah never got to see the results of this, did he?

499
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.200
Micah in fact got exiled here in just

500
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.300
a few years after he writes this.

501
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.300
He died actually before they got it so he didn't get to see any of

502
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:39.400
this.

503
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.200
He never got to see that God would come through for his people. He never

504
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.300
got to see this restoration was going to happen that God would

505
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.200
flip the enemy on its head so he had to trust.

506
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.200
He had to have faith in his God in this Lord

507
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.300
of all the Earth that God you're gonna do this in your time in your

508
00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:57.400
way.

509
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.400
That's what we see in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 over and over

510
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.400
and over again, but specifically for those who died without

511
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.100
seeing what God promised.

512
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.600
Listen to Hebrews 11:13. These all

513
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.800
died in faith not having received the

514
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.700
things promised.

515
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.900
But having seen them and greeted them from afar having acknowledged

516
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.000
that they were strangers and Exiles on the

517
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.300
Earth.

518
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.700
See, that's how Micah could get there.

519
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.300
That's how Micah could trust it's because he know this was not

520
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:30.800
his home.

521
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.200
Even if it was perfect, even if everything was exactly as they

522
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.200
would want it in Judah it still wasn't home.

523
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.600
He was longing for something more.

524
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.300
And yet in that faith.

525
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.000
He was able to see beyond.

526
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.100
I mean at least 2700 years. We don't know when Jesus come

527
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:55.100
back, but it's 2,700 years later than he was living. So he was able

528
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.200
to see at least that far and he's able to kind of greet it

529
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.800
from afar and saying God, alright, it feels

530
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.400
like we're already there.

531
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.400
I can see it. I can know it's real. I know you're going to

532
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.300
do this and so I can trust you and I can almost live in it

533
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:09.700
now.

534
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.900
Greet it from afar.

535
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.200
So his faith was in the promise of God.

536
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.400
You and I must have that same faith.

537
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.600
That same Forward Thinking mentality.

538
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.600
We must trust that the Lord is coming back

539
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.500
one day, right?

540
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.200
That this isn't it.

541
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.400
I hope this isn't it, right.

542
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.400
We must trust that he is coming back. We must trust that even

543
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.300
among those who are opposed to Yahweh today

544
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.200
that even some of those will come to believe.

545
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.200
Remember Saul wrote two thirds of the New Testament

546
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.700
right? He he was clearly opposed to All Things Yahweh.

547
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.100
and yet

548
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.200
God saved him.

549
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.800
So God's going to do that with some.

550
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.200
We must trust that the evil and wickedness. We see

551
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.600
around us every day.

552
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.100
That God's gonna do something about that.

553
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.300
That he eventually will bring this to

554
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.000
pass that it won't be swept under the rug.

555
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.300
We've got to trust that God's gonna do it and his time in his way. We got to trust that

556
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.600
God's Gonna satisfy our souls as we deny ourselves are

557
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.300
the things of the world and we turn to him. We've got to trust that

558
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.200
that's going to be satisfying.

559
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.300
We have to trust him.

560
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.300
See we can rewrite or try to rewrite our own future.

561
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.600
We can try to manipulate things to benefit ourselves to make

562
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.500
it the way we want it to but we need to

563
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.200
do what God is asking us to do right now and just trust

564
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.500
him.

565
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.100
Not try to control manipulate make it this way and fix this and do it

566
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.900
this way. No, just trust him.

567
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.200
His future plan not our ideas on what

568
00:29:59.200 --> 00:29:59.900
that plan should be.

569
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.300
Remember the bumper sticker God is my co-pilot.

570
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.900
No, God is your pilot you sit in that seat you sit

571
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.200
in the back. Don't even sit up the next day you sit in the back and just

572
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.200
let him fly for you. Right if God's your co-pilot. I

573
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.700
mean you're flying the plane. You don't want that.

574
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.400
You want his plan his time his way.

575
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.200
Now I know listen that's hard to do in the Darkness.

576
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.000
It's hard to see when you can't see I get that.

577
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.500
But that's why Micah is such a great example.

578
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.600
Because it was as bad as it could ever get for June for

579
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.300
Micah and Judah.

580
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.500
It was as bad as anything. It was way past

581
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.900
anything we experienced today.

582
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.200
and yet

583
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.200
still trusted

584
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.700
he still trusted never wavered.

585
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.000
You might never see God's promises come to pass in your lifetime.

586
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.400
You might be asking and praying and longing for

587
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.400
justice in this situation that situation you might never see it in your

588
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:09.700
lifetime.

589
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.500
But that doesn't mean that God's not on his throne.

590
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.700
It doesn't mean that God's not good.

591
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.800
He just got a different timeline than you do.

592
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.400
He's going to take care of the situation. So trust him.

593
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.100
Let him do the task. Let him

594
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.200
do his work. Let him do what he's going to do what he's promised

595
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.100
to do. Let him show himself strong.

596
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.300
And have faith Trust.

597
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.200
But even as you do that.

598
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.400
It doesn't give you license to be lazy.

599
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.100
That you have nothing to do. I'm just trusting God. I'm gonna

600
00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.200
sell the couch play Xbox like no, that's not what we're talking about.

601
00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.900
Because what it might could do.

602
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.900
What's verse 14 said he'd do.

603
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.200
He interceded for others.

604
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.600
He prayed.

605
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.900
He went to the Lord and pray at minimum.

606
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.100
Whatever situation we're facing we can pray.

607
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.500
Because Micah has been standing by himself for

608
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.100
the whole book.

609
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.400
He's standing on God's side against everybody else

610
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.100
and he's like, it's like God. I feel like I'm

611
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.300
alone here and and I'm speaking your truth. Nothing

612
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.700
is happening. Nothing is changing God. Why is

613
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.300
this not working?

614
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.100
And he could easily be tempted in that moment to look down

615
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.000
on everybody else.

616
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.500
Like God I'm seeking you. I'm trying to seek you. They're not even close. They're

617
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.100
not even trying.

618
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.700
Something to look down on them.

619
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.600
That's not his attitude is it?

620
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.000
His attitude is to pray and have a heart

621
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.500
broken for them. He Longs for restoration for

622
00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:56.900
them.

623
00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.100
They don't deserve it.

624
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.200
But he's saying God restore them.

625
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.300
He loved them too much to let them go. He's done it through the whole book. God.

626
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.500
Don't let them go. Bring them back. My heart is still towards

627
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.600
them. So God restore them.

628
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.600
I know it may feel like you have.

629
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.200
Nothing, you can do about the situation. You're facing in your

630
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:19.300
life.

631
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.300
Everything's falling apart around you and you feel like I can't do

632
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.500
anything about this. There's never nothing you

633
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.000
can do about it.

634
00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.500
There's always something you can do about the situation.

635
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.900
In fact, it's the most important thing you can do.

636
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.800
That's why one of our values as a church is desperate dependence.

637
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.300
That we know we're trusting God to do

638
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.200
the real work in this thing, right? Because only God

639
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.000
can change a heart.

640
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.000
Only God can fix a situation Only God

641
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.200
Can restore a relationship. You can't do

642
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.300
those things. You can't get in there and change it. It's got to

643
00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.000
be God's work. That's why we pray.

644
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.600
That's why I send a letter to our widows and widowers every Monday thing here

645
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.300
pray for these things because I need them. You need them. We need

646
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.200
them to carry these needs to God and we're

647
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.300
not praying to get God to do something for us like a vending

648
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.200
machine. Here's a dollar. Give us this we want God to

649
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.100
do something that only he can take the credit for

650
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.800
And we need him to do the work that we can't do anything about.

651
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.100
So we lean on him we need him.

652
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.300
You can do that you can intercede for yourself. Of course. Yes, but

653
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.300
you can intercede for your family for your spouse for

654
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.300
your coworker for your neighbor for your nation for your

655
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.400
your friends. You can intercede on behalf

656
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.800
of them praying for Restoration in God's

657
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800
time God's way.

658
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.800
But then there's also this we talk about restoration. Yes, we want.

659
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.400
That in our lives, but but when was the last time you actually prayed

660
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.300
for someone to be restored spiritually. When

661
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.500
was the last time you prayed for an unbeliever to know

662
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:02.800
Jesus?

663
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.800
Remember a couple years ago. We did the Hoosier one thing.

664
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.800
Are you praying that God would which is the most important restoration by

665
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.500
the way that God would restore someone spiritually.

666
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.200
Save them reach into their sin and draw them

667
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.300
out to righteousness. It's saving their soul from

668
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:21.700
death.

669
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.100
When was the last time you did

670
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.500
that commit to praying for someone to know Jesus?

671
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.500
Because again if this day hasn't come

672
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.300
yet, we know God's not done drawing people to himself

673
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:38.800
yet.

674
00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.400
Still be more that will come.

675
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.800
Which leads to the last thing we should do now?

676
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.600
In light of this future Kingdom that's coming. We should proclaim

677
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.100
the gospel.

678
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.100
Proclaim the gospel Proclaim this good news.

679
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.900
Tell of God's salvation.

680
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.300
You may recall Romans 10:13. It says everyone who calls

681
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.500
on the name of the Lord will be saved.

682
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.900
But listen to verse 14 and then verse 15 how then will

683
00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.300
they call on him in whom they've not believed?

684
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.300
How are they to believe in him of whom they've never

685
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:20.500
heard?

686
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.100
And how are they to hear without someone preaching?

687
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.800
And how are they to preach unless they are sent.

688
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.600
As it is written how beautiful are the feet of those who preach

689
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.600
the good news.

690
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.000
What do we say every time we end to worship Gathering here at Henderson Hills?

691
00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.200
You are sent.

692
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.100
This is what you're sent to do if you've ever wondered.

693
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.500
Yes, love people all the things but but this is what you're sent to

694
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.100
do right to proclaim the gospel to preach the

695
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.200
good news that Jesus lived died and resurrected in our

696
00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.300
place. That is the best news. But here's the thing about good

697
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.300
news, you know, if there's good news, then there's comparatively bad

698
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:03.600
news.

699
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.400
And that's what we saw in Micah 7 right that

700
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.700
sin that causes desolation that brings God's judgment

701
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.500
in your life. And so listen if you are sitting here today or

702
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.200
watching that you are you're still in your sin, if

703
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.400
that's you as you've not turned to Jesus. You've not given him your

704
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.700
whole heart and life then that is where you are.

705
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.600
You're in the bad news, you're going to receive judgment. You're going to be desolate.

706
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.100
Which is why we as Believers must be good

707
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:33.600
news people.

708
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.600
Where we are declaring there's a way out of your emptiness.

709
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.200
There's a way out of this Brokenness and it's

710
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:41.800
found in Jesus.

711
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.500
That's what we Proclaim and declare and believe in sing. It's found

712
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.100
in Jesus, but remember

713
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.000
Someone cannot call on salvation unless they

714
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.900
believe Jesus is the way.

715
00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.000
And they cannot believe.

716
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.400
Unless they've heard that.

717
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.100
And they cannot hear that unless someone tells them.

718
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.700
You are sent right like that's that's the whole point of that.

719
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.300
It's what's beautiful. Jesus eats beautiful are

720
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.700
the feet of those who bring good news. That's you and me we can

721
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.300
be that.

722
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.300
Now, let me be clear. It's up to God to save right? It's not

723
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.900
up to us. We're still reformed here. Like this is God's deal. He's saving

724
00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.600
we're just vessels of his Mercy. He

725
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.400
calls us to do what Psalm 96 says that as

726
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.300
we go in our lives. We declare his glory among

727
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.800
the Nations His Marvelous Works among all the peoples. We

728
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.200
say among the Nations the Lord Reigns,

729
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.300
like that's our task now is to

730
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.200
go declare who he is. And again, we don't know who he's Gonna

731
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.400
Save. We don't know how many he's Gonna Save but check

732
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.300
this out Micah 7 said that when God's kingdom comes he

733
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.300
will save some

734
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.300
He's going to save.

735
00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.700
Some will call on him some will come to his Mountain.

736
00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.500
So that means for us we can have confidence that

737
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.600
as we go tell of God's salvation as we do go

738
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.300
and declare the gospel some will believe

739
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.600
Even if we're terrible at sharing the gospel God still

740
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.500
going to save even those who appear to be opposed

741
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:18.800
to it right now.

742
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.300
The nation's a Syria Babylon some will

743
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:23.400
come.

744
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.000
Is just the way God works.

745
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.400
He works through US plus there's this.

746
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.400
Jesus said in Matthew 24:14 this gospel. The

747
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.500
kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony

748
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.500
to All Nations, and then the end will come.

749
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.500
In other words, this is part of the conclusion of the story.

750
00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.100
Because you know, he didn't poof you out to Heaven as soon as

751
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.400
you believed right he left you here.

752
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.300
And he left you here for a reason and that reason is not

753
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.400
merely to survive until he gets here or to hold

754
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.500
up in in this cult like building that

755
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.300
you're gonna just get away from the world. That's not what he's called us to

756
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.600
he left you here to include you on his mission.

757
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.500
He has graciously chosen you to use

758
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.300
you as his Global ambassador.

759
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.200
Which means you can pray you can give you can

760
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.600
support and encourage others to go. You can go yourself, but

761
00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.100
you are an ambassador as that just like

762
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.500
Abraham was blessed to be a blessing to others.

763
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.600
You are saved to carry that same gospel to

764
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:29.800
others.

765
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.500
Bless you with the gospel to be a blessing to All

766
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.000
Nations.

767
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.300
But hear me you won't do that. I won't do

768
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:41.400
that.

769
00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.400
Only if I'm transformed by

770
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.000
what Jesus has done in my life will I see

771
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:50.700
that as worth it?

772
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.800
Well, I will I pay the cost needed to make that a

773
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.300
reality in my life. Will I walk the Hard

774
00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.100
Road? It's going to take to care the gospel. Carry the gospel to this

775
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.500
people group only if I see him as

776
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.400
worth it. If I desire more than anything else to see

777
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.300
him as glorious to the ends of the Earth to see

778
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.300
him as glorious the ends of my street. The only one I

779
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.100
see him as that and I desire his worship to be

780
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.200
going to the ends of the Earth. That's the only reason I'll do it.

781
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.700
Because that's what's coming on the day. He returns, right?

782
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.100
on that day, Micah 7

783
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.500
On that day, the Nations will

784
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:30.900
worship.

785
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.000
The mountain will be raised up. God will be

786
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.000
seen as glorious.

787
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.100
That's what is coming. And so now

788
00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.400
we just get the privilege of playing a small part of seeing

789
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.600
that Kingdom Come even in small forms today.

790
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.600
That's what's coming one day. And so we get the opportunity. John

791
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.600
Piper said it well like missions exist because worship doesn't

792
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.200
There's places. Jesus is not being worshiped. And so we

793
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.200
carry the gospel to them in hopes that they will.

794
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.000
prayerfully that they will

795
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:08.800
and so as you

796
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:10.600
as you

797
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.900
prayerfully entrust your future to the Lord.

798
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.200
Say God, whatever you want. Whatever your deal is, you're playing not

799
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.900
mine. I entrust my future to you as you do that.

800
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.800
Commit to carrying his gospel to your neighborhood to

801
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.300
the Nations to your family.

802
00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.300
For his glory because he is worth it

803
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:31.700
Church.

804
00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.300
He's worth it. Not just in here when it's really

805
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:39.500
easy to say. Yes glory to God praise the Lord and we're

806
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.600
going to sing here in a little while and it's going to be yes, praise God. It's

807
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.300
worth it even out there.

808
00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.600
He is worth it when it gets hard when it gets tricky

809
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.900
and people push back he's worth it.
