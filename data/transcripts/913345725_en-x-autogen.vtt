WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:01.205
So good to see you.

2
00:00:01.205 --> 00:00:02.845
Welcome, glad you're here tonight.

3
00:00:03.505 --> 00:00:07.285
Uh, digging deeper every week, these Wednesday nights

4
00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:10.165
we're progressing quickly through this series.

5
00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:12.605
It's almost shocking how fast we've gone.

6
00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:16.245
This is our fifth, uh, of seven big rocks.

7
00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:20.845
And then we're gonna take, uh, a week to look at, um,

8
00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:23.245
as you watch the video, you see them put

9
00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:24.365
in the smaller rocks.

10
00:00:24.985 --> 00:00:28.405
Second, we'll talk a about one specifically,

11
00:00:28.865 --> 00:00:31.245
and then, uh, allude to a few others.

12
00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.125
And then we're gonna take two weeks at the end

13
00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:35.645
to talk about some sand.

14
00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:39.005
And so the, the last things, the,

15
00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:40.605
the third level things you might say.

16
00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.645
And so that's, that's coming,

17
00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:44.485
but we're already that far into it.

18
00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:48.205
So, um, it's gonna be, gonna be quick to get

19
00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:50.525
through the end, but I, it's been fruitful for my soul.

20
00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:52.005
Like I've said before, this has been a,

21
00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.005
a challenging study in a good way,

22
00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:57.165
and grown my soul and my spirit a lot.

23
00:00:57.345 --> 00:00:58.965
So hopefully for us as a church as well.

24
00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:02.415
So tonight we're gonna dig deeper into humanity

25
00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:04.095
that, uh, that big rock.

26
00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:06.535
We studied Sunday, and so I wanna pray for us.

27
00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:09.615
We'll dive in. Lord, thank you again for tonight.

28
00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:12.975
And, uh, as we've been praying these nights,

29
00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:15.295
these Wednesday nights, that they would be edifying

30
00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:18.935
to your church, to your people, uh, not just

31
00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:19.935
for head knowledge, but

32
00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:22.175
that we would understand a little bit better about

33
00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:24.915
who you are, about what you've done,

34
00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:30.595
who we are in light of that, so that we can know you

35
00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:33.875
better and love you more deeply.

36
00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:37.575
And then in light of your love for us,

37
00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:39.695
we can love others more faithfully.

38
00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:42.965
So, God, thank you for your word.

39
00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:46.725
Thank you for the, uh, the, the depth of people

40
00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:49.085
throughout the history of the church

41
00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:50.725
that have studied these things well, that have,

42
00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:54.685
have written full books on the subject we're gonna talk

43
00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:56.045
about for a few minutes tonight.

44
00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:58.005
Uh, just thank you for the work done,

45
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:01.205
and I pray that you'd now give us insight

46
00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:04.325
and wisdom as I share a little bit as Steve comes

47
00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:06.045
and shares a little bit with us as well,

48
00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:09.605
as we answer questions and, and just humbly walk

49
00:02:09.605 --> 00:02:11.045
before you gotta give us that humility

50
00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:14.725
before you, that we don't have all the answers.

51
00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:19.165
We, we don't know all you do, and you are the answer.

52
00:02:19.945 --> 00:02:21.485
And so, Lord, I pray we,

53
00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:24.045
we walk in humility in these moments.

54
00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:27.325
Uh, but then we also look to you

55
00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:32.405
in confidence in faith that you have

56
00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:35.885
shown us enough about yourself.

57
00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:39.605
As incomprehensible as you are, you've shown us enough

58
00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:44.085
that we can know you intimately and love you

59
00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:47.325
because you've loved us first, because thank you for that.

60
00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:50.045
Show us tonight, uh, what you want us to,

61
00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:51.165
to know a little better

62
00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:53.805
and how we can then be doers of your word,

63
00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:55.965
not heroes only in Jesus' name.

64
00:02:56.395 --> 00:02:59.535
Amen. All right.

65
00:02:59.595 --> 00:03:03.895
So the big rock was humanity, mankind, uh, the,

66
00:03:03.915 --> 00:03:08.495
the common term in theological circles is man,

67
00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:11.495
and, and so we, we tried to kinda hedge away from that

68
00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:13.215
because we don't want to connote anything

69
00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:14.815
but that This is about humans.

70
00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:18.935
Uh, so humanity, you might see it in various books, humanity

71
00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:20.495
or mankind or, or man.

72
00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:23.175
What we mean is human beings, male

73
00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:24.935
and female, as Genesis one talks about.

74
00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:28.095
And, and the question I asked Sunday was,

75
00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:30.495
why is this a foundational rock humanity?

76
00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:33.055
I mean, it seems like kind of already inherently know.

77
00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:36.455
Well, again, because we don't understand our

78
00:03:37.255 --> 00:03:39.215
salvation rightly, if we don't understand

79
00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:42.375
who we are in light of who God is, uh,

80
00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:45.215
we don't understand our relationship with him.

81
00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:48.495
In light of that, we don't then look in the right places for

82
00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:50.695
life because we're

83
00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:52.735
misunderstanding some things about ourselves.

84
00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:55.255
And then we also treat each other wrongly

85
00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:59.695
because we don't understand what value people have.

86
00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:01.655
So this is why it's a big rock.

87
00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:04.895
It affects salvation when we talk about these big rocks,

88
00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:08.455
by the way, in many ways, we're talking salvific issues,

89
00:04:09.435 --> 00:04:12.655
things that have to do with salvation, right?

90
00:04:12.955 --> 00:04:15.375
Not, not what we'll get to later with the smaller rocks

91
00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:18.615
and the sand, but like, these things matter forever

92
00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:22.535
in our salvation relationship with God.

93
00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:25.375
So that was the first question was then, who are we?

94
00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:28.335
Yes, we need to know who we are. And talking about identity.

95
00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:31.095
Genesis one, of course, God said,

96
00:04:31.095 --> 00:04:35.215
let us make man in our image, in our likeness, um, male

97
00:04:35.215 --> 00:04:36.295
and female, he created them.

98
00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:40.655
So it was this picture that God created humans in his image,

99
00:04:41.205 --> 00:04:42.775
male and female distinct.

100
00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:45.575
Psalm eight was something I didn't quote, but,

101
00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:48.375
but just listen to the, the picture Psalm eight creates

102
00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:51.055
of this idea of, of image of God

103
00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:52.335
and what he created in humans.

104
00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:54.535
When I look at your heavens, Psalm eight, three,

105
00:04:54.925 --> 00:04:57.135
when I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,

106
00:04:57.235 --> 00:04:59.495
the moon and the stars, which you've set in place,

107
00:04:59.525 --> 00:05:03.175
like just the magnitude of creation, the beauty of creation.

108
00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:07.345
Verse four, what is man that you are mindful of him

109
00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:10.065
and the son of man that you care for him,

110
00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:13.465
Psalmist is just stunned.

111
00:05:13.975 --> 00:05:17.105
Look at the massive beauty and magnitude of creation.

112
00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:18.625
And you think about us

113
00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:23.695
and he says, why you have made him humans

114
00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:26.295
a little lower than the heavenly beings,

115
00:05:26.295 --> 00:05:30.655
meaning the angels not lower in value or class, but,

116
00:05:30.795 --> 00:05:33.415
but literally lower in a sense that way

117
00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:36.175
you've made him a little lower than the heavenly beings

118
00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:37.935
and crowned him with glory

119
00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:41.025
and honor, talking about humans crowned

120
00:05:41.025 --> 00:05:42.105
with glory and honor.

121
00:05:42.105 --> 00:05:44.345
You've given him dominion over the works of your hands.

122
00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:45.665
You've put all things under his feet

123
00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:47.705
that's referencing Genesis one.

124
00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:52.625
So as humans, we are crowned.

125
00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.745
It says, with glory and honor, what's the glory?

126
00:05:55.775 --> 00:05:56.865
Well, it's not in ourselves.

127
00:05:56.985 --> 00:05:59.565
The glory is that we bear the image of God.

128
00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:03.745
Each one of us, every human who's ever existed

129
00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:08.665
bears the image, the glorious image of God.

130
00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:14.135
Now, we know that that's tainted because of sin.

131
00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:15.455
We'll get to that in a second. But,

132
00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:20.375
but humans still even in sin, bear the image of God.

133
00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:23.605
And, and we, we look at people

134
00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:25.125
and like, how is that the image of God?

135
00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:28.205
No, there's just an inherent sense in our personhood.

136
00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:32.605
The essence of who we are as humans bears the image of God,

137
00:06:32.605 --> 00:06:33.725
even in our sinful state.

138
00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:35.885
And one day we'll be perfected again to

139
00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:39.725
perfectly represent the image of God as Jesus did.

140
00:06:39.905 --> 00:06:42.045
But we're not there yet. Once did,

141
00:06:42.045 --> 00:06:43.365
and we'll get to this again in a second,

142
00:06:43.365 --> 00:06:45.245
once we did at one point Adam

143
00:06:45.265 --> 00:06:48.525
and Eve sin, we're not one day we'll be again.

144
00:06:49.555 --> 00:06:51.045
Okay? So what does it mean? Image of God?

145
00:06:51.045 --> 00:06:54.485
Just as a reminder, the reflection, the image of

146
00:06:55.155 --> 00:06:58.125
when you look at that, you see something about the source.

147
00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:00.885
So when you look at humans, you see something about

148
00:07:01.265 --> 00:07:03.445
who God is, his character, his personality,

149
00:07:03.585 --> 00:07:04.805
his heart, his actions.

150
00:07:05.385 --> 00:07:06.725
We can create in a sense,

151
00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:08.485
but we can't create out of nothing like he did.

152
00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:10.525
But when we put a couple things together

153
00:07:10.525 --> 00:07:13.165
and make something new like Angie does

154
00:07:13.185 --> 00:07:15.685
so well in the cafe like that, that's a creation.

155
00:07:16.225 --> 00:07:18.605
It reflects God's creative heart

156
00:07:18.785 --> 00:07:22.565
and his his heart that did out of nothing.

157
00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:26.525
What we try to do with, with something, uh, his, his heart.

158
00:07:26.585 --> 00:07:28.925
And we love people like he loved us, his personality,

159
00:07:29.425 --> 00:07:30.525
you know, he's joy and,

160
00:07:30.545 --> 00:07:31.565
and all of these things

161
00:07:31.565 --> 00:07:33.765
that you can see in scripture, he, he is that.

162
00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:37.085
And so our personalities reflect some of God.

163
00:07:37.935 --> 00:07:40.605
Colossians one 15 though, says, Jesus is the image

164
00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:41.685
of the invisible God.

165
00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:47.365
We are some images of God, but he is the image perfectly.

166
00:07:48.865 --> 00:07:52.045
So when we talk about us as images, what, what

167
00:07:52.045 --> 00:07:53.445
that means again, is that we are

168
00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:54.645
to reflect God to the world.

169
00:07:54.745 --> 00:07:57.525
That's what we are responsible for.

170
00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:00.765
So we can't treat people like their property or transactions

171
00:08:00.945 --> 00:08:03.685
or, or less than in any way.

172
00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:07.245
Every person from conception until

173
00:08:07.765 --> 00:08:12.595
physical death is equally independently valuable in

174
00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:15.395
who they are as a person, image bearer of God.

175
00:08:15.615 --> 00:08:17.315
So we show respect, we show dignity.

176
00:08:18.015 --> 00:08:20.075
Uh, doesn't mean we agree with everything everybody does,

177
00:08:20.335 --> 00:08:21.555
but it just means we respect

178
00:08:22.095 --> 00:08:23.435
and show the dignity that it is.

179
00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:26.155
Everybody's valuable in that. So that's who we are.

180
00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:28.275
But then the question is, why are we,

181
00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:30.195
uh, we know who we are.

182
00:08:30.195 --> 00:08:31.835
But now why? Of course that was

183
00:08:31.835 --> 00:08:34.035
because we were created for the glory of God.

184
00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:37.315
Everything, every person, everything exists for

185
00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:39.075
the glory of God.

186
00:08:39.535 --> 00:08:42.635
We are God's ambassadors to take that glory

187
00:08:43.215 --> 00:08:44.435
to people around us.

188
00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:49.835
Official representatives reflections to a foreign nation.

189
00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:52.895
And then what went wrong, of course, was

190
00:08:53.685 --> 00:08:54.975
that sin entered the world.

191
00:08:55.065 --> 00:08:56.645
And, and so we have a problem there,

192
00:08:56.665 --> 00:08:59.725
and I, I skipped this a little bit in James three on Sunday,

193
00:08:59.825 --> 00:09:02.845
but it, it talked about in James three, verse six and seven

194
00:09:02.845 --> 00:09:07.165
and eight, that the tongue stains the whole body.

195
00:09:08.075 --> 00:09:11.895
Uh, it, it in sense it a microcosm

196
00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:14.175
of our sinful state.

197
00:09:14.175 --> 00:09:16.055
When you just see what comes out of our mouths,

198
00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.175
it's 'cause it's in our hearts.

199
00:09:17.235 --> 00:09:20.095
And it, it stains, it sets on fire the whole.

200
00:09:20.915 --> 00:09:23.175
Um, and it talks about in scripture

201
00:09:23.175 --> 00:09:24.655
that our words can justify us.

202
00:09:25.205 --> 00:09:27.535
Doesn't mean we're made perfect by our words.

203
00:09:27.535 --> 00:09:31.055
It just means that we confess Jesus's Lord with our mouths.

204
00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:35.855
So we speak that word in our heart, cry,

205
00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:38.335
but it says, our words can condemn us.

206
00:09:38.335 --> 00:09:39.815
It says they're set on fire by hell,

207
00:09:39.915 --> 00:09:41.375
by sin, they stain everything.

208
00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:42.895
They set life on fire.

209
00:09:43.795 --> 00:09:46.375
Uh, and as much as we wanna restrain it, as much pain

210
00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:50.905
and sorrow that our words create, again, every kind of beast

211
00:09:50.905 --> 00:09:52.745
and bird, reptile, sea creature can be tamed,

212
00:09:52.745 --> 00:09:54.945
has been tamed, but no human being can tame the tongue.

213
00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:58.185
It's a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

214
00:09:59.525 --> 00:10:01.265
So we needed God to change our hearts,

215
00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:03.385
give us new hearts that will speak differently.

216
00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:08.035
But just becoming a Christian doesn't take away all

217
00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:09.915
that poison that's in there.

218
00:10:11.655 --> 00:10:13.955
Not in our hearts, God's new creation heart,

219
00:10:14.015 --> 00:10:18.705
but in our flesh, what's remnant from

220
00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:22.305
what we were born into, there's still this measure of sin

221
00:10:22.305 --> 00:10:23.665
that that shows up because of that.

222
00:10:25.155 --> 00:10:27.895
Now, the thing about it is the new heart

223
00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:32.285
should restrain the tongue,

224
00:10:32.285 --> 00:10:34.125
should restrain our sin.

225
00:10:34.585 --> 00:10:35.885
We should be very different.

226
00:10:36.225 --> 00:10:38.485
Now, we talked a lot about that Sunday,

227
00:10:38.665 --> 00:10:40.645
but it's still gonna happen.

228
00:10:41.715 --> 00:10:43.415
You know, you're still gonna say something you shouldn't say

229
00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.735
to your kids, or you're gonna say, uh,

230
00:10:46.945 --> 00:10:49.295
perpetuate gossip at work, or, or something like that.

231
00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:50.455
It's, it's going to happen.

232
00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:56.215
But as we grow into this image perfectly more every

233
00:10:56.235 --> 00:10:58.095
day, it restrains it.

234
00:10:58.555 --> 00:11:00.255
That's the grace of God in that.

235
00:11:00.255 --> 00:11:02.175
So the solution is a new heart. Eel 36.

236
00:11:02.175 --> 00:11:06.695
We talked a lot about that. Um, that's, that's that the,

237
00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:08.375
the tongue is a fire picture.

238
00:11:08.955 --> 00:11:11.775
And we need the Holy Spirit, the water, the living water

239
00:11:11.835 --> 00:11:15.295
of Christ to come quench the fire that our tongues are,

240
00:11:15.405 --> 00:11:16.855
that our sin is.

241
00:11:18.175 --> 00:11:19.675
And so we need him to quench it first,

242
00:11:19.675 --> 00:11:21.475
and then we need to soak in his living water.

243
00:11:22.225 --> 00:11:24.035
It's what his word is for, it's

244
00:11:24.035 --> 00:11:25.715
what his spirit is in us for.

245
00:11:26.415 --> 00:11:27.955
Uh, if we allow our flesh to dominate,

246
00:11:28.015 --> 00:11:29.795
we get Galatians five works of the flesh.

247
00:11:29.795 --> 00:11:31.835
If we allow our spirit, his spirit to dominate,

248
00:11:31.975 --> 00:11:33.515
we get the fruit of the spirit,

249
00:11:33.845 --> 00:11:35.555
those things in Galatians five as well.

250
00:11:37.135 --> 00:11:38.595
So we, we've looked at our,

251
00:11:38.815 --> 00:11:41.875
our heart's kinda like a sponge, what we put in there.

252
00:11:41.945 --> 00:11:43.995
It's what's gonna come out when it's squeezed.

253
00:11:45.015 --> 00:11:47.235
So we need to be soaking in the word.

254
00:11:48.295 --> 00:11:50.235
Now, the question, it was kind of alluded to last week,

255
00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:53.605
David asked it, why did sin

256
00:11:53.705 --> 00:11:55.685
happen in the first place?

257
00:11:56.705 --> 00:11:59.005
God could've, could've stopped it.

258
00:12:00.225 --> 00:12:01.925
Uh, then we wouldn't have gone through the trauma

259
00:12:01.985 --> 00:12:03.645
and suffering and all the things that we have.

260
00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:06.485
Well, the follow up question to that is then,

261
00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:07.685
did God ordain sin?

262
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:10.265
Then? Like, did God create sin?

263
00:12:11.955 --> 00:12:13.045
Well, we have to say no.

264
00:12:13.245 --> 00:12:14.325
'cause James earlier says that,

265
00:12:14.325 --> 00:12:15.685
that God cannot be tempted by evil.

266
00:12:15.705 --> 00:12:18.085
So he can't sin in that sense.

267
00:12:19.425 --> 00:12:24.045
But we could say that God ordained the whole, whole process

268
00:12:25.335 --> 00:12:29.315
in such a way that he's not morally guilty for the sin.

269
00:12:29.655 --> 00:12:34.395
But he has so ordained it that he would set it up like that

270
00:12:34.495 --> 00:12:36.555
so that he receives even more glory

271
00:12:38.135 --> 00:12:41.795
in saving sinners than he would by just creating a bunch

272
00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:44.475
of robots that just obey him all the time and follow suit.

273
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.465
That's one way he could have gotten glory.

274
00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:49.065
But, but the beauty of it is

275
00:12:49.065 --> 00:12:51.545
that he gave us a measure of choice.

276
00:12:51.545 --> 00:12:52.905
We'll talk about this Sunday,

277
00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:56.145
and then a couple weeks later, a measure of free will there

278
00:12:56.205 --> 00:12:57.945
to where we can choose.

279
00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:00.905
Yet he also ordained the whole.

280
00:13:01.445 --> 00:13:03.025
So that's a mind blowing concept.

281
00:13:03.035 --> 00:13:05.665
We'll have to figure that one out. But the idea is he

282
00:13:05.825 --> 00:13:10.025
ordained this process so that he could maximize the glory

283
00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:13.545
through us as fallen creatures redeemed

284
00:13:14.175 --> 00:13:15.985
into a relationship with him again,

285
00:13:16.955 --> 00:13:20.865
where he took us from death, made us alive just like Jesus.

286
00:13:21.925 --> 00:13:24.945
So there's a measure of God's glory that's heightened

287
00:13:26.385 --> 00:13:29.265
by the fact that sin entered the world

288
00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:31.425
and that we're all born into it.

289
00:13:34.065 --> 00:13:36.005
So we'll get to probably some questions about that.

290
00:13:36.025 --> 00:13:37.245
But, but let's think about this.

291
00:13:37.515 --> 00:13:41.125
This, uh, original creation, original

292
00:13:42.445 --> 00:13:44.765
creation of humans, the relationships that we have.

293
00:13:46.065 --> 00:13:48.765
So typically, I I offhandedly said this Sunday,

294
00:13:49.205 --> 00:13:51.405
whenever you have, most theologians would say

295
00:13:51.405 --> 00:13:53.965
that there are three relationships we're created to have.

296
00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:56.645
When you look at Genesis one and two, the way God made Adam

297
00:13:56.665 --> 00:13:58.365
and Eve, there's three relationships.

298
00:13:59.065 --> 00:14:02.205
The first is a relationship with nature, with creation,

299
00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:06.125
that God gave them dominion over creation.

300
00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:08.845
And still we have today, I'll get to that in a second.

301
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.685
So, relationship with nature, relationship with God,

302
00:14:12.235 --> 00:14:14.245
that he's walking with them in the cool of the night

303
00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:17.365
of the day, and then relationship with others, with people,

304
00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:19.325
that those are the three relationships

305
00:14:19.345 --> 00:14:20.485
we are created to have.

306
00:14:22.775 --> 00:14:26.875
Now, each of these, I'm about to get to these stages,

307
00:14:27.985 --> 00:14:30.715
affects the way that we handle those relationships.

308
00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:34.655
So when you think about the original image of God, Adam

309
00:14:34.715 --> 00:14:37.455
and Eve, their relationship with creation was perfect.

310
00:14:37.745 --> 00:14:40.535
Their relationship with God was fully face-to-face their

311
00:14:40.535 --> 00:14:43.135
relationship with nature or with, uh, with others.

312
00:14:43.755 --> 00:14:48.655
No shame naked together, right? That was the original image.

313
00:14:50.405 --> 00:14:51.925
Well, when sin entered the world,

314
00:14:51.925 --> 00:14:54.925
there was a perverted image, then a tainted image,

315
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.765
where even those three relationships

316
00:14:57.765 --> 00:14:59.005
were affected by that, right?

317
00:15:00.195 --> 00:15:01.525
What happened in Genesis three?

318
00:15:01.585 --> 00:15:03.725
He cursed the ground, which means work is hard.

319
00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:07.725
So our relationship with nature is hard.

320
00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:12.125
It's thorns, it's thistles, it's broke knee.

321
00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:14.565
Like, it's these things that make life hard.

322
00:15:15.945 --> 00:15:20.535
Our relationship with God was not face-to-face anymore.

323
00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.015
In fact, he kicked him out

324
00:15:22.015 --> 00:15:23.535
of his presence, out of the garden.

325
00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:26.235
And we've been separated from him ever since.

326
00:15:26.335 --> 00:15:29.555
In our sin, our relationship with others was broken.

327
00:15:29.905 --> 00:15:32.475
They had to create things to hide from each other

328
00:15:32.615 --> 00:15:35.835
and just in shame, they were not like they were before.

329
00:15:36.095 --> 00:15:37.435
So the perverted image, you see,

330
00:15:37.435 --> 00:15:38.635
even affects those relationships.

331
00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:43.275
Then when Christ comes to restore, renew

332
00:15:44.095 --> 00:15:45.515
the image in us.

333
00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:49.475
Think of how those three relationships are changed again,

334
00:15:50.405 --> 00:15:51.465
the relationship with nature.

335
00:15:52.595 --> 00:15:56.925
Well, we now see that God has created this the way he has.

336
00:15:57.025 --> 00:15:58.725
And one day we'll recreate this.

337
00:15:58.785 --> 00:16:00.565
So it's actually something we wanna steward.

338
00:16:00.675 --> 00:16:04.785
Well, it's not throwaway, even creation.

339
00:16:06.155 --> 00:16:10.295
'cause God created it. Our relationship with God is new.

340
00:16:10.765 --> 00:16:14.415
It's renewed where we now have him dwelling within

341
00:16:14.475 --> 00:16:15.815
us by grace.

342
00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:17.855
Our relationship with others has changed,

343
00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:21.215
where we can now be kind and tenderhearted

344
00:16:21.395 --> 00:16:23.495
and loving all of that.

345
00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:26.535
You see how the renewed image now changes those three

346
00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:28.615
relationships, and then one day, again,

347
00:16:29.005 --> 00:16:31.815
perfected image when Jesus returns makes it all new.

348
00:16:31.945 --> 00:16:33.575
Think of those three relationships again,

349
00:16:34.075 --> 00:16:35.095
our relationship with nature.

350
00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:37.615
New heavens and new earth. It's all good.

351
00:16:37.615 --> 00:16:41.215
Again, perfect lying, lamb, laying down together,

352
00:16:43.055 --> 00:16:44.835
our relationship with God, back, face

353
00:16:44.835 --> 00:16:47.595
to face, our relationship with others.

354
00:16:47.745 --> 00:16:50.115
Perfect. No shame, no sin.

355
00:16:51.265 --> 00:16:52.725
So it, it's really interesting you think

356
00:16:52.725 --> 00:16:54.205
of those three relationships in all

357
00:16:54.205 --> 00:16:56.165
of those stages throughout history

358
00:16:56.345 --> 00:16:58.085
and throughout our history as humans.

359
00:17:00.555 --> 00:17:02.055
And so I, I alluded to this last week,

360
00:17:02.055 --> 00:17:05.415
but I found it, I couldn't fit it in Sunday, but I found it.

361
00:17:05.485 --> 00:17:07.815
It's similar to those four stages I just mentioned.

362
00:17:08.435 --> 00:17:09.655
And this is from Augustine.

363
00:17:09.775 --> 00:17:11.335
I couldn't recall where it was last week,

364
00:17:11.835 --> 00:17:13.615
but he says the, there are four states,

365
00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:17.055
and they correspond to the four states

366
00:17:17.115 --> 00:17:18.775
of man in relation to sin.

367
00:17:19.235 --> 00:17:21.135
So he is not talking necessarily about the relationships

368
00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:23.455
with, it's kind of with God,

369
00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:25.535
but not with nature, not with others, really.

370
00:17:26.315 --> 00:17:28.095
Uh, but here's his four states.

371
00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:30.215
Again, there's Latin terms for these.

372
00:17:30.295 --> 00:17:34.775
I won't try to read those. But our original image,

373
00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:38.455
our original state, Adam and Eve, they were able to sin

374
00:17:39.675 --> 00:17:41.535
and they were able not to sin.

375
00:17:42.985 --> 00:17:44.155
They had both abilities.

376
00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:46.795
They were able not to sin,

377
00:17:47.255 --> 00:17:52.085
and they were able to sin in our perverted

378
00:17:52.085 --> 00:17:53.125
image after sin

379
00:17:53.335 --> 00:17:54.485
after Genesis three,

380
00:17:56.445 --> 00:17:59.505
humans then were not able not to sin.

381
00:18:01.215 --> 00:18:04.875
So as hard as you and I try, we can't, not sin,

382
00:18:06.215 --> 00:18:07.435
we don't want to in many ways,

383
00:18:07.455 --> 00:18:08.915
but we, we just, it, it happens.

384
00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:14.315
That's humans in our perverted image. Okay?

385
00:18:14.315 --> 00:18:16.955
Well, then Christ comes, renews the image.

386
00:18:17.865 --> 00:18:21.755
This is his third state. It is able now not to sin.

387
00:18:24.275 --> 00:18:28.175
So there's a possibility now in us, with Christ in us,

388
00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:32.015
the Holy Spirit's power that we can choose not to sin.

389
00:18:32.015 --> 00:18:34.855
One Corinthians 10 13, no temptation is overtaken you,

390
00:18:34.955 --> 00:18:36.415
except what is common to man.

391
00:18:36.795 --> 00:18:39.375
God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted

392
00:18:39.375 --> 00:18:40.415
beyond what you can bear.

393
00:18:40.555 --> 00:18:42.815
But when you are tempted, he'll provide a way out

394
00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:44.295
so you can stand up under it,

395
00:18:45.135 --> 00:18:48.085
which means there's the possibility you have

396
00:18:48.835 --> 00:18:51.205
when you're tempted by whatever fill in the blanket is

397
00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:55.185
to not have to do it in your sin

398
00:18:55.645 --> 00:18:58.945
before this perverted image, you are not able not to sin,

399
00:18:59.685 --> 00:19:03.145
but now renewed, you are able not to sin again.

400
00:19:04.615 --> 00:19:06.945
Well, then there's one more state, the perfected image,

401
00:19:07.365 --> 00:19:11.865
the glorified state where we are unable to sin.

402
00:19:13.655 --> 00:19:18.085
So you think about the end of the book, he says,

403
00:19:18.085 --> 00:19:19.965
no more tears, no more pain, no more suffering,

404
00:19:19.965 --> 00:19:21.325
no more sorrow, no more death.

405
00:19:22.265 --> 00:19:25.645
All those former things that passed away included

406
00:19:26.345 --> 00:19:29.415
no more sin, which means you

407
00:19:29.415 --> 00:19:32.815
and I can't sin anymore, unable to sin.

408
00:19:34.485 --> 00:19:36.265
So you see the state

409
00:19:36.285 --> 00:19:40.745
before the fall able to sin and able not to sin

410
00:19:41.445 --> 00:19:44.355
after the fall, not able not to sin.

411
00:19:44.615 --> 00:19:48.315
We have to, that's what we are required to in a sense,

412
00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:51.435
after Christ, able now not to sin.

413
00:19:51.975 --> 00:19:55.595
And then glorified heavens, new heavens, new earth with him,

414
00:19:55.735 --> 00:19:57.835
unable to sin at that place.

415
00:20:00.245 --> 00:20:03.225
So it, it just helps me kind of understand a little bit

416
00:20:03.225 --> 00:20:06.905
of this progression of humanity, of where we have come and,

417
00:20:06.925 --> 00:20:08.225
and where we are right now.

418
00:20:08.485 --> 00:20:11.625
So if you are a believer in Christ, you've been renewed,

419
00:20:11.845 --> 00:20:13.745
the image of God is being renewed in you,

420
00:20:13.805 --> 00:20:15.225
and one day it'll be perfect again.

421
00:20:15.405 --> 00:20:17.025
But right now, you're in that renewed state

422
00:20:17.025 --> 00:20:18.385
where you're able not to sin.

423
00:20:18.575 --> 00:20:19.785
That gives me hope.

424
00:20:22.875 --> 00:20:26.205
Like I, I remember a, a time

425
00:20:26.305 --> 00:20:31.085
and in my life where it felt like I couldn't do

426
00:20:31.285 --> 00:20:33.605
anything but fill in the blank.

427
00:20:33.885 --> 00:20:34.925
Whatever was tempting me at the time,

428
00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.775
because I'd never understood really what it meant

429
00:20:38.955 --> 00:20:41.975
to live the power of God, of, of his spirit inside

430
00:20:42.525 --> 00:20:43.895
with the renewed image of God

431
00:20:43.895 --> 00:20:45.135
that I don't have to send anymore.

432
00:20:45.685 --> 00:20:49.465
That now we're not saying you can be perfect

433
00:20:50.085 --> 00:20:53.215
in this life, but we don't have to sin.

434
00:20:55.285 --> 00:20:59.025
So to walk into a place of, of temptation, a moment

435
00:20:59.025 --> 00:21:03.495
of temptation, and realize there's the ability

436
00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:04.535
to overcome this right now.

437
00:21:05.235 --> 00:21:07.175
Not in me, not in anything I have,

438
00:21:07.595 --> 00:21:09.855
but in Christ, in me, the hope of glory.

439
00:21:10.765 --> 00:21:13.055
Galatians two 20, I've been crucified with Christ.

440
00:21:13.255 --> 00:21:15.415
I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.

441
00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:16.895
The life I live in, the flesh.

442
00:21:17.015 --> 00:21:19.015
I live by faith in the son of God who loved me

443
00:21:19.015 --> 00:21:20.055
and gave himself up for me.

444
00:21:21.385 --> 00:21:25.645
That's the power I have to not follow into that sin again.

445
00:21:28.225 --> 00:21:31.165
So that's, I I wanted to dig into

446
00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:33.005
that a little bit more than just brush over it on Sunday.

447
00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:34.685
So this was a, a great time for that.

448
00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:36.485
Steve, why don't you come on up here.

449
00:21:36.485 --> 00:21:38.725
I wanna ask you a couple questions to help kind

450
00:21:38.725 --> 00:21:41.405
of facilitate towards some, uh,

451
00:21:41.495 --> 00:21:43.205
maybe further questions as we go forward.

452
00:21:45.175 --> 00:21:47.975
I, I, I found this quote as he's coming up here, this quote

453
00:21:49.245 --> 00:21:51.295
that when we think about, okay,

454
00:21:51.295 --> 00:21:52.575
what does that renewed image look like?

455
00:21:52.685 --> 00:21:56.215
What does it look like for me to live a life as a human

456
00:21:57.415 --> 00:21:59.035
yet renewed, restored?

457
00:22:00.775 --> 00:22:02.435
How do I know what to do? How do I know

458
00:22:02.435 --> 00:22:03.675
what the right thing is to do?

459
00:22:04.575 --> 00:22:09.435
Here's a quote. As a follower of Jesus, I want to learn

460
00:22:10.055 --> 00:22:12.915
to live the life Jesus would live

461
00:22:13.695 --> 00:22:16.075
if Jesus were living my life.

462
00:22:19.445 --> 00:22:22.425
So I, as a pastor, I've gotten a lot

463
00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:24.785
of questions from people who are kind of discerning, like,

464
00:22:24.785 --> 00:22:26.385
what, what's my career path?

465
00:22:26.415 --> 00:22:27.865
What should I, what should I do

466
00:22:27.865 --> 00:22:29.945
with making a decision on this job or that job?

467
00:22:30.125 --> 00:22:32.545
And how do I treat this person at work?

468
00:22:32.605 --> 00:22:34.505
How do I, you know, so we get all kinds of questions.

469
00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:37.565
That's a pretty simple, and it

470
00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:38.885
goes with the what would Jesus do?

471
00:22:39.085 --> 00:22:41.925
Bracelets, I always kind of mock those earlier in my life.

472
00:22:43.325 --> 00:22:45.895
It's actually pretty good if this is what it is, right?

473
00:22:46.035 --> 00:22:47.495
As a follower, Jesus, I wanna learn

474
00:22:47.495 --> 00:22:49.935
to live the life Jesus would live if he was living my life,

475
00:22:51.545 --> 00:22:55.315
which means every one of us is gonna have a bit

476
00:22:55.315 --> 00:22:56.315
of a nuance there.

477
00:22:57.725 --> 00:23:02.585
So I'm not in your workplace, you're not in her home,

478
00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:05.545
you're, you're, you're in different family

479
00:23:05.545 --> 00:23:06.785
background situations.

480
00:23:07.445 --> 00:23:09.785
How would Jesus live this life?

481
00:23:11.055 --> 00:23:14.555
If I'm in the image of God, he's the perfect image of God.

482
00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:17.755
How would he live this? If he was me?

483
00:23:18.295 --> 00:23:22.835
How would he live this out? Decide, act, think, uh, speak.

484
00:23:23.625 --> 00:23:24.875
Just a helpful little thought.

485
00:23:24.915 --> 00:23:26.435
I just found that as I thought it'd be helpful.

486
00:23:26.585 --> 00:23:28.915
Okay, so Steve, I I already kind

487
00:23:28.915 --> 00:23:32.355
of answered this a little bit, but talk about fallen man

488
00:23:32.605 --> 00:23:33.955
still bearing the image of God.

489
00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:36.475
How does that work? How, how does it look

490
00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:37.755
whenever we look around, there's a mess

491
00:23:37.855 --> 00:23:42.315
and people are, some are, some are really far.

492
00:23:42.425 --> 00:23:45.155
Like we typically talk about like Hitler state.

493
00:23:45.585 --> 00:23:47.165
Is he in the image of God, really?

494
00:23:47.405 --> 00:23:48.445
I mean, then you got this,

495
00:23:49.235 --> 00:23:51.885
this really good person down the street from me in my

496
00:23:51.885 --> 00:23:53.525
neighborhood, not a believer,

497
00:23:53.585 --> 00:23:54.885
but they're a good dude, right?

498
00:23:54.955 --> 00:23:56.685
He's a good guy, good American citizen.

499
00:23:57.915 --> 00:23:59.405
Yeah, of course he's bearing the image of God.

500
00:23:59.425 --> 00:24:02.005
But in all of us, we're all fallen.

501
00:24:02.265 --> 00:24:05.205
So does fallen man still bear the image of God?

502
00:24:05.865 --> 00:24:07.245
And how does that even work out?

503
00:24:11.795 --> 00:24:13.405
They don't let me up here very often.

504
00:24:13.905 --> 00:24:17.445
Um, and I've got all my resources here,

505
00:24:17.745 --> 00:24:22.205
and, um, uh, I, I really was thinking about this image

506
00:24:22.365 --> 00:24:24.365
of God and the idea that, um,

507
00:24:25.225 --> 00:24:28.165
um, what does that mean?

508
00:24:28.165 --> 00:24:29.685
Is it, is it a physical image?

509
00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:31.725
I mean, I don't look like God.

510
00:24:32.185 --> 00:24:34.245
Um, but John has talked about, about the,

511
00:24:34.585 --> 00:24:36.485
the characteristics and things that we think about.

512
00:24:36.945 --> 00:24:40.165
And, um, uh, I'm thinking that, uh,

513
00:24:41.685 --> 00:24:43.965
I remember a story, and I, I want to answer the question,

514
00:24:44.025 --> 00:24:47.285
but I remember that often in growing up, um,

515
00:24:47.905 --> 00:24:50.925
people would say, you remind me a lot of your dad,

516
00:24:52.225 --> 00:24:54.605
or You're a spitting image of your dad.

517
00:24:55.585 --> 00:24:56.805
We had the same haircut.

518
00:24:57.585 --> 00:25:01.485
And, uh, my father's gone on to be with the Lord.

519
00:25:01.705 --> 00:25:06.285
And, uh, he was, um, baldheaded and he was a coach.

520
00:25:06.785 --> 00:25:09.445
And, um, I didn't want to be a coach

521
00:25:09.445 --> 00:25:13.685
because I didn't want to follow exactly what he did.

522
00:25:13.785 --> 00:25:16.325
But there were some, there are many aspects of his character

523
00:25:17.035 --> 00:25:21.205
that I wanted to follow, and I, and I appreciated that,

524
00:25:21.265 --> 00:25:22.285
and I learned from him.

525
00:25:22.665 --> 00:25:26.205
So, when I think about the image of God and,

526
00:25:26.545 --> 00:25:31.525
and how that is, man, I, uh, tied to that, I'm, I'm,

527
00:25:31.935 --> 00:25:36.165
there are certain things that, uh, that, that are tied to

528
00:25:36.275 --> 00:25:39.165
that opportunity to be, to learn from

529
00:25:39.165 --> 00:25:40.325
what God has in our lives

530
00:25:40.385 --> 00:25:43.645
and how He, he tells us how to live our lives.

531
00:25:44.385 --> 00:25:48.685
Uh, but I'm not God. I don't, I'm going to make mistakes.

532
00:25:49.045 --> 00:25:50.445
I am a fallen man.

533
00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:54.525
Um, but yet I, I'm not without hope.

534
00:25:55.105 --> 00:26:00.005
Um, and I, uh, I, I can't, uh, think enough about, um,

535
00:26:00.745 --> 00:26:05.325
how important it is to remember, uh, that, uh,

536
00:26:05.645 --> 00:26:06.925
I am in the image of God,

537
00:26:06.925 --> 00:26:10.245
and that that's, uh, not something that, uh, uh,

538
00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:11.685
is not without hope

539
00:26:11.865 --> 00:26:15.765
and not without, uh, um, a future promise

540
00:26:16.185 --> 00:26:18.405
and a future goal and eternity.

541
00:26:18.705 --> 00:26:22.245
Uh, I I made myself some notes about some things that, uh,

542
00:26:22.865 --> 00:26:25.005
um, uh, image

543
00:26:25.305 --> 00:26:29.605
and, uh, I'm still going to be a person that, uh, is, is

544
00:26:30.175 --> 00:26:31.205
going to sin.

545
00:26:31.665 --> 00:26:33.045
Um, and,

546
00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:35.965
but John made the point just a minute ago about the fact

547
00:26:35.995 --> 00:26:38.685
that you can walk yourself into a situation

548
00:26:38.745 --> 00:26:41.405
and you can say, okay, what am I gonna do?

549
00:26:42.305 --> 00:26:44.965
Am I going to, what would would Jesus do?

550
00:26:45.625 --> 00:26:47.685
But now to know that through the, the power

551
00:26:47.685 --> 00:26:51.685
of the Holy Spirit, uh, I have the ability to, through

552
00:26:52.265 --> 00:26:55.165
the Holy Spirit, to, to make the right decision

553
00:26:55.385 --> 00:26:56.845
and turn away from that sin.

554
00:26:57.305 --> 00:27:01.125
Um, and I think that's, um, something that I, I I need

555
00:27:01.245 --> 00:27:02.765
to continually remember

556
00:27:03.025 --> 00:27:05.805
and, uh, uh, practice in my own life.

557
00:27:05.945 --> 00:27:08.725
Um, so that's kinda the things that I think about, uh,

558
00:27:09.315 --> 00:27:11.045
with regard to the image of God

559
00:27:11.185 --> 00:27:13.085
and how we look at that in our own lives.

560
00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:15.565
Um, I'm not sure that, uh,

561
00:27:17.865 --> 00:27:20.525
fallen man still bears the image of God.

562
00:27:20.985 --> 00:27:24.365
Um, but it's, it's, it's, it's such that, um,

563
00:27:24.925 --> 00:27:26.365
I just wanna make sure I remember

564
00:27:26.365 --> 00:27:29.005
that image is not the exact reflection.

565
00:27:29.105 --> 00:27:31.125
And then we're not talking about a physical image.

566
00:27:31.375 --> 00:27:33.245
We're talking about characters and qualities

567
00:27:33.245 --> 00:27:36.565
and ingredients that make up so much, uh, in our own lives

568
00:27:36.585 --> 00:27:40.005
and how we want to try to improve, uh, constantly,

569
00:27:40.055 --> 00:27:42.205
constantly wanting to improve. So,

570
00:27:42.835 --> 00:27:43.835
Yeah. And, and there's a measure

571
00:27:43.835 --> 00:27:46.445
of what we call common grace

572
00:27:47.225 --> 00:27:48.325
in people too.

573
00:27:49.505 --> 00:27:52.445
Um, I can't remember exactly what it said,

574
00:27:52.785 --> 00:27:56.475
but we're,

575
00:27:57.545 --> 00:28:00.835
what common grace does, which I would say kinda the image

576
00:28:00.835 --> 00:28:05.365
of God does, is that we're not all as bad as we could be.

577
00:28:06.245 --> 00:28:07.685
Hmm. Uh,

578
00:28:08.185 --> 00:28:12.235
and that's God's restraint of things, which you look at.

579
00:28:12.235 --> 00:28:15.195
Again, typical example, you look at Hitler like,

580
00:28:15.695 --> 00:28:17.155
did he restrain Hitler?

581
00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:21.475
He could have done more. I mean that as bad as it was.

582
00:28:22.215 --> 00:28:25.745
And so there's a measure of that image of God

583
00:28:25.745 --> 00:28:27.345
that there's a bit of restraint in that,

584
00:28:27.345 --> 00:28:29.745
and that's com common grace kind of blended together there.

585
00:28:29.765 --> 00:28:31.065
But, but yeah.

586
00:28:31.085 --> 00:28:34.865
So there's a picture of God in the image, all of

587
00:28:34.865 --> 00:28:35.865
Us Yeah. Reading on it

588
00:28:35.865 --> 00:28:38.145
says, this means that man is like God

589
00:28:38.145 --> 00:28:39.145
and represents God.

590
00:28:39.435 --> 00:28:42.025
Man's offspring is made in his image and likeness

591
00:28:42.755 --> 00:28:45.225
after the fall, man is still in God's image.

592
00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:47.265
Genesis nine, six James three nine.

593
00:28:47.565 --> 00:28:51.305
Though it is distorted through Christ, the full image

594
00:28:51.305 --> 00:28:55.585
of God is being renewed in us through Christ.

595
00:28:57.085 --> 00:29:01.585
Um, and when he appears one John three, two,

596
00:29:01.965 --> 00:29:03.665
we shall be like him. Yeah.

597
00:29:04.135 --> 00:29:07.905
Yeah. That perfected image again, right? Yeah. All right.

598
00:29:07.905 --> 00:29:09.065
So this, this is a tough one,

599
00:29:09.065 --> 00:29:11.705
and I wrestled with this, I alluded to it Sunday, about

600
00:29:12.645 --> 00:29:17.105
how can we be held liable or guilty for Adam's sin.

601
00:29:18.005 --> 00:29:20.025
We weren't there. Like, we weren't in the garden.

602
00:29:20.045 --> 00:29:24.585
We didn't eat the fruit. How, how can we be born into sin?

603
00:29:25.415 --> 00:29:27.225
That wasn't our fault. I mean,

604
00:29:27.225 --> 00:29:28.545
that's just the typical comments

605
00:29:28.545 --> 00:29:29.985
that people will make in light of that.

606
00:29:30.005 --> 00:29:33.785
So how, why am I guilty because of Adam's sin

607
00:29:35.545 --> 00:29:39.445
Number a couple years ago, uh, when I was in the, uh,

608
00:29:39.775 --> 00:29:44.285
elder mentoring process, uh, we had the privilege of going

609
00:29:44.285 --> 00:29:46.365
through a series of questions, um,

610
00:29:47.425 --> 00:29:51.165
and theological questions, um, similar questions to what was

611
00:29:51.885 --> 00:29:52.925
I had the experience in

612
00:29:52.925 --> 00:29:54.805
and dealing with when I became going

613
00:29:54.805 --> 00:29:56.405
through the be a deacon.

614
00:29:56.405 --> 00:29:58.365
But anyway, the question was, uh,

615
00:29:59.395 --> 00:30:01.165
what are the results of Adam's sin?

616
00:30:01.225 --> 00:30:02.525
And so I wrote and,

617
00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:06.605
and quoted, uh, God's word in Romans chapter five, verse 12,

618
00:30:06.785 --> 00:30:09.885
due to Adam's sin, sin entered the human race,

619
00:30:09.885 --> 00:30:12.845
therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man

620
00:30:13.465 --> 00:30:14.685
and death through sin.

621
00:30:14.745 --> 00:30:16.605
And so death spread to all men,

622
00:30:16.605 --> 00:30:20.325
because all sinned for sin indeed was in the world

623
00:30:20.325 --> 00:30:21.445
before the law was given.

624
00:30:21.905 --> 00:30:24.245
But sin is not counted where there is no law

625
00:30:24.385 --> 00:30:26.205
yet death reigned from Adam to Moses,

626
00:30:26.835 --> 00:30:29.885
even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression

627
00:30:29.885 --> 00:30:32.405
of Adam, who was the type of the one who was to come.

628
00:30:33.625 --> 00:30:36.525
But the free gift does not like the trespass were

629
00:30:37.265 --> 00:30:39.405
if many died through one man's trespasses,

630
00:30:39.405 --> 00:30:40.765
much more have the grace of God

631
00:30:40.765 --> 00:30:42.885
and the free gift by the grace of that one man,

632
00:30:42.885 --> 00:30:45.125
Jesus Christ, abounded for many.

633
00:30:46.025 --> 00:30:48.085
And the free gift is not like the result of

634
00:30:48.085 --> 00:30:49.125
that one man's sin.

635
00:30:50.105 --> 00:30:53.525
So Romans chapter five, beginning with verse 12, um,

636
00:30:54.775 --> 00:30:57.125
tells us clearly that the Bible, uh, says

637
00:30:57.125 --> 00:30:59.005
that sin entered the world through one man.

638
00:30:59.745 --> 00:31:01.925
Uh, and it was through Adam that sin entered.

639
00:31:02.345 --> 00:31:07.045
And, uh, we are born, we were, we are born physically alive,

640
00:31:07.145 --> 00:31:08.805
but spiritually dead.

641
00:31:09.225 --> 00:31:12.245
And, uh, it may not seem fair to be saddled

642
00:31:12.245 --> 00:31:15.125
with Adam sin nature, but it's certainly consistent

643
00:31:15.125 --> 00:31:18.445
with other aspects of, of human humanity.

644
00:31:19.225 --> 00:31:22.245
We inherit some physical characteristics such as eye color

645
00:31:22.425 --> 00:31:24.365
and hairstyle from my dad,

646
00:31:24.905 --> 00:31:28.125
but we also inherit some spiritual characteristics.

647
00:31:28.785 --> 00:31:31.125
Um, and so in the same way having to send nature

648
00:31:32.225 --> 00:31:34.525
is in a sense a matter of spiritual genetics.

649
00:31:34.625 --> 00:31:36.805
Uh, it's just a natural part of life.

650
00:31:37.065 --> 00:31:41.645
Um, however, the Bible says that, uh, uh, you know,

651
00:31:41.645 --> 00:31:42.685
that that's where we are.

652
00:31:43.065 --> 00:31:47.685
Um, and, uh, there's discussion about imputed sin

653
00:31:47.785 --> 00:31:49.685
and personal sin.

654
00:31:50.305 --> 00:31:51.965
Uh, imputed sin is from Adam

655
00:31:52.105 --> 00:31:55.045
and credit to us, uh, Romans five 18.

656
00:31:55.865 --> 00:31:58.645
Uh, and then, uh, we sin every day.

657
00:31:58.785 --> 00:32:01.885
Uh, we have a sin nature, and therefore we will sin.

658
00:32:02.395 --> 00:32:05.125
Ephesians two, three says, among whom we all once lived,

659
00:32:05.125 --> 00:32:08.285
and the passions of our flesh carrying out the desires

660
00:32:08.285 --> 00:32:09.485
of the body and the mind,

661
00:32:09.545 --> 00:32:11.245
and we're by nature, children are worth

662
00:32:11.755 --> 00:32:13.085
like the rest of mankind.

663
00:32:13.305 --> 00:32:17.965
But for Jesus, uh, in our lives

664
00:32:18.545 --> 00:32:22.405
and salvation, uh, that gets us, uh, where we need to be.

665
00:32:22.945 --> 00:32:26.605
And that's how I, fairness issue is,

666
00:32:27.675 --> 00:32:28.805
doesn't seem fair,

667
00:32:28.865 --> 00:32:33.125
but boy, God's grace is awesome.

668
00:32:33.995 --> 00:32:35.485
Yeah. And, and the reality,

669
00:32:35.645 --> 00:32:38.205
I I just quickly said this Sunday,

670
00:32:38.465 --> 00:32:42.765
the reality is if we don't believe that, if we kind

671
00:32:42.765 --> 00:32:45.245
of deny the reality, like, wow, we, Adam stood in

672
00:32:45.245 --> 00:32:46.405
for us, that's not fair.

673
00:32:47.315 --> 00:32:49.485
Well, Christ stood in for us,

674
00:32:50.025 --> 00:32:51.285
so we better believe that's fair.

675
00:32:52.025 --> 00:32:53.325
It just works the other way too.

676
00:32:54.265 --> 00:32:58.085
And it says it in Romans five, that idea of Christ is,

677
00:32:58.265 --> 00:33:01.285
or Adam was our head in a sense, like the first

678
00:33:02.585 --> 00:33:04.165
in order in line.

679
00:33:04.875 --> 00:33:07.845
Well, Christ is the new head of the church,

680
00:33:08.345 --> 00:33:12.525
and his sacrifice counts for us imputes to us

681
00:33:12.525 --> 00:33:15.125
where Adam imputed sin to us

682
00:33:15.985 --> 00:33:18.205
Christ imputes righteousness to us.

683
00:33:19.155 --> 00:33:23.005
It's the, the double imputation on, uh,

684
00:33:23.025 --> 00:33:25.765
the cross it talks about in a lot of books.

685
00:33:25.865 --> 00:33:27.925
But we,

686
00:33:29.185 --> 00:33:31.325
our sin was imputed onto Christ,

687
00:33:32.545 --> 00:33:35.965
and Christ's righteousness was imputed onto us in

688
00:33:35.965 --> 00:33:37.845
that transaction on the cross.

689
00:33:39.225 --> 00:33:41.685
So just like Adam sinned made us guilty,

690
00:33:41.745 --> 00:33:43.605
Christ righteous makes us righteous.

691
00:33:44.705 --> 00:33:47.205
And so we have to, we have to tie those two together.

692
00:33:47.745 --> 00:33:48.925
And yeah, it might not seem fair,

693
00:33:49.305 --> 00:33:52.085
but I read this, uh, I couldn't find it now.

694
00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:53.565
I just was skimming so many things.

695
00:33:53.725 --> 00:33:57.925
I read this today, and they were probably a little facetious

696
00:33:57.925 --> 00:33:59.205
in saying, but like,

697
00:33:59.205 --> 00:34:00.685
do we really think we would've made a different

698
00:34:00.845 --> 00:34:02.285
decision in the garden?

699
00:34:03.155 --> 00:34:06.045
Whether it was that one moment or some other moment?

700
00:34:07.205 --> 00:34:09.085
I, that's a pretty arrogant statement for us to make,

701
00:34:09.085 --> 00:34:10.565
that I wouldn't have fallen.

702
00:34:11.395 --> 00:34:13.645
Yeah. I, I wouldn't have done that. I,

703
00:34:13.945 --> 00:34:17.765
Uh, that's, that's tenuous to say that, right?

704
00:34:18.665 --> 00:34:22.165
Um, because we all have that same nature that Adam had.

705
00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:24.365
We don't know what it's like to be Adam,

706
00:34:24.365 --> 00:34:25.885
where we're able not to sin,

707
00:34:26.905 --> 00:34:30.805
but if we were created in that moment, still,

708
00:34:30.825 --> 00:34:32.245
you see the same thing. Yeah.

709
00:34:32.245 --> 00:34:35.645
And I red here, but here's the good news.

710
00:34:35.785 --> 00:34:38.045
God loves sinners. In fact, he's acted

711
00:34:38.045 --> 00:34:41.205
to overcome our sin nature by sending Jesus to pay

712
00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:45.165
for our sins once and pay for our sins,

713
00:34:45.165 --> 00:34:46.805
and offer us his righteousness.

714
00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:50.085
First Peter two, uh, 24,

715
00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:53.205
he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree

716
00:34:53.515 --> 00:34:55.125
that we might die to sin

717
00:34:55.145 --> 00:34:58.085
and live to righteousness by his wounds,

718
00:34:58.145 --> 00:34:59.165
you have been healed.

719
00:35:00.395 --> 00:35:04.845
Yeah. So that's, that gives me great comfort. Yeah.

720
00:35:06.035 --> 00:35:07.845
Okay. I wanna make one more comment

721
00:35:07.865 --> 00:35:09.725
and then we'll open it up for questions.

722
00:35:10.185 --> 00:35:14.845
Uh, Genesis 1 27 says, male and female, he created them.

723
00:35:15.865 --> 00:35:18.965
So mankind, humans were created male and female.

724
00:35:18.985 --> 00:35:22.445
He created 'em, he created other, other animals, male

725
00:35:22.445 --> 00:35:25.205
and female as well, 'cause they could reproduce.

726
00:35:25.265 --> 00:35:28.005
But male and female, he created them humans.

727
00:35:29.785 --> 00:35:31.965
If there's anything being confused in our world right now,

728
00:35:31.965 --> 00:35:33.485
that's one of the big ones, right?

729
00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:38.685
We, we believe those

730
00:35:40.165 --> 00:35:45.105
male female standards are

731
00:35:45.205 --> 00:35:47.545
static, immutable, unchangeable,

732
00:35:49.135 --> 00:35:52.545
that at the essence of each person, whether they're a man

733
00:35:52.545 --> 00:35:54.305
or a woman, they're male or female.

734
00:35:56.005 --> 00:36:00.865
And so we believe that as a church, uh, we will stand on

735
00:36:00.865 --> 00:36:02.105
that as a church.

736
00:36:03.645 --> 00:36:07.385
In saying that, though, with the confusion that's out there,

737
00:36:07.525 --> 00:36:08.785
we must stand on it.

738
00:36:08.785 --> 00:36:11.065
Teach our children, teach our teens,

739
00:36:11.065 --> 00:36:13.545
teach ourselves what that means.

740
00:36:14.725 --> 00:36:18.905
But with the confusion that's out there, knowing

741
00:36:18.905 --> 00:36:22.985
that each one of those people that you might get so angry at

742
00:36:23.095 --> 00:36:26.065
that I might think is crazy, for whatever reason,

743
00:36:26.845 --> 00:36:28.585
that's also an image barrier of God.

744
00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:34.275
So, yes, disagree, yes, we can hold to our standards,

745
00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:36.475
we can hold to our beliefs about that, and we should,

746
00:36:36.475 --> 00:36:37.675
because it's very clear.

747
00:36:39.415 --> 00:36:43.755
But in our reaction to somebody who's

748
00:36:43.815 --> 00:36:48.215
so vitriolic about that, passionate about that

749
00:36:49.315 --> 00:36:51.815
we treat them as an image bearer of God

750
00:36:54.135 --> 00:36:57.635
and love them, speak truth in love.

751
00:36:59.575 --> 00:37:04.195
But we, we hope that the dignity you show to someone,

752
00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:06.675
rather than ranting, raving Facebook comments,

753
00:37:07.665 --> 00:37:09.995
honking horns, throwing stuff, whatever it is

754
00:37:09.995 --> 00:37:11.315
that's happened, sadly,

755
00:37:13.945 --> 00:37:17.475
what if we could be different in our disagreement?

756
00:37:19.185 --> 00:37:21.085
The world has a, a tough time figuring out

757
00:37:21.085 --> 00:37:22.605
that you can disagree and still love someone.

758
00:37:23.475 --> 00:37:27.365
It's possible. But in our disagreement, we still love them.

759
00:37:27.895 --> 00:37:30.285
Treat them with the dignity that an image bearer

760
00:37:30.285 --> 00:37:31.365
of God deserves.

761
00:37:32.075 --> 00:37:34.765
Because there is something under the surface there

762
00:37:36.925 --> 00:37:39.925
probably a lot of background and baggage and history

763
00:37:39.945 --> 00:37:41.885
and things that if you just sit

764
00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:45.365
and get curious about their life, something might show up

765
00:37:45.365 --> 00:37:49.205
that that would be a way you can apply the gospel.

766
00:37:49.805 --> 00:37:52.445
S solve the balm of the soul to their lives.

767
00:37:53.585 --> 00:37:57.325
So yes, we can hold fast to our, to our beliefs,

768
00:37:58.505 --> 00:38:01.205
and we can love those people that don't believe that,

769
00:38:01.435 --> 00:38:03.085
because that's an image bearer of God.

770
00:38:04.025 --> 00:38:05.725
So that's, that's why this humanity stuff matters.

771
00:38:05.725 --> 00:38:08.445
Because it, it does affect the way we treat people.

772
00:38:09.305 --> 00:38:12.485
And I put it in my email today to the church that, you know,

773
00:38:12.485 --> 00:38:14.685
there's all kinds of ways that the least of these

774
00:38:14.715 --> 00:38:17.045
that are often kicked to the side are not image bearers

775
00:38:17.045 --> 00:38:18.045
of God are forgotten.

776
00:38:18.825 --> 00:38:20.845
How about the church? We believe that

777
00:38:20.845 --> 00:38:22.885
that special needs child is an image bearer of God.

778
00:38:22.885 --> 00:38:24.525
Let's care for them. Let's love them, their families.

779
00:38:24.525 --> 00:38:28.325
Let's serve them. Uh, the, the prisoner, the outcast,

780
00:38:28.325 --> 00:38:29.525
the widow, the orphan.

781
00:38:29.665 --> 00:38:31.685
All these things that are so often kicked

782
00:38:31.705 --> 00:38:33.125
to the side, the single mom.

783
00:38:33.155 --> 00:38:35.205
Like, just say, no, no, you don't fit here.

784
00:38:35.785 --> 00:38:39.175
No, listen, you are loved here.

785
00:38:39.695 --> 00:38:40.815
'cause you're an image bearer of God.

786
00:38:42.875 --> 00:38:45.775
How different that is to the world

787
00:38:46.115 --> 00:38:49.575
who judges based on value, we say, you're all valuable.

788
00:38:50.605 --> 00:38:54.135
Come on, God loves you. We love you.

789
00:38:54.985 --> 00:38:56.215
Let's treat each other like that.

790
00:38:56.235 --> 00:39:00.515
That's what the image that the humanity doctrine leads us

791
00:39:00.515 --> 00:39:03.275
to in part that image bearer of God.

792
00:39:04.665 --> 00:39:07.755
Okay? So questions. You would have got the mics up here.

793
00:39:09.005 --> 00:39:10.075
Steve will answer for you.

794
00:39:10.615 --> 00:39:12.475
And then, uh, we'll go that directions.

795
00:39:18.305 --> 00:39:20.485
Hi. Mm-Hmm. Okay.

796
00:39:20.585 --> 00:39:21.605
So, um,

797
00:39:22.805 --> 00:39:26.525
I was raised in very small Southern Baptist churches where

798
00:39:27.285 --> 00:39:31.165
I think the theology was probably 95% correct.

799
00:39:31.465 --> 00:39:36.125
But I've spent my adult life weeding through the other 5%

800
00:39:36.185 --> 00:39:38.725
to try to make sure that

801
00:39:40.525 --> 00:39:41.745
I'm seeing it correctly.

802
00:39:42.365 --> 00:39:45.705
Um, so every once in a while something is said that kind

803
00:39:45.705 --> 00:39:47.225
of pricks back at those things.

804
00:39:47.845 --> 00:39:51.425
Um, some of the fire and brimstone stuff that I was taught.

805
00:39:52.245 --> 00:39:53.905
And you said something on Sunday

806
00:39:54.015 --> 00:39:55.665
that stopped me for a second.

807
00:39:56.045 --> 00:39:59.425
And I just was wondering if you could clarify, um,

808
00:40:00.725 --> 00:40:02.785
and I I'm gonna misquote it, I'm sorry.

809
00:40:03.325 --> 00:40:05.465
But it was something about how

810
00:40:07.325 --> 00:40:10.495
there's a record of the things we say

811
00:40:11.685 --> 00:40:13.815
that will be held accountable for.

812
00:40:14.875 --> 00:40:18.535
And having grown up being taught that you'd have the movie

813
00:40:18.555 --> 00:40:21.975
of your life played, you know, at the gates of heaven.

814
00:40:22.735 --> 00:40:26.255
I was just wondering if you could kind of clarify

815
00:40:28.245 --> 00:40:30.215
what that looks like for a believer.

816
00:40:30.695 --> 00:40:31.695
Hmm.

817
00:40:32.475 --> 00:40:34.015
That's good. That's a good question.

818
00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:38.855
And I'm so thankful that, uh, you

819
00:40:38.855 --> 00:40:41.735
and others would be wrestling with some of those things

820
00:40:41.735 --> 00:40:42.975
that we should be wrestling with.

821
00:40:43.315 --> 00:40:45.735
So praise the Lord for that. I was

822
00:40:45.735 --> 00:40:46.895
trying to find where it is.

823
00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:51.775
Uh, yeah, Matthew 1236.

824
00:40:51.835 --> 00:40:54.575
So Jesus is saying either, either make the tree good

825
00:40:54.575 --> 00:40:55.975
and it's fruit good, or make the tree bad.

826
00:40:55.975 --> 00:40:58.135
And it's fruit bad for the tree is known by its fruit.

827
00:40:59.235 --> 00:41:00.255
You brood of vipers.

828
00:41:00.255 --> 00:41:01.815
How can you speak good when you are evil?

829
00:41:01.955 --> 00:41:03.695
For outta the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks,

830
00:41:04.075 --> 00:41:06.415
the good person out of his good treasure brings forth good.

831
00:41:06.835 --> 00:41:09.375
The evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil.

832
00:41:10.095 --> 00:41:12.655
I tell you, on the day of judgment, people will give account

833
00:41:12.715 --> 00:41:15.735
for every careless word they speak for.

834
00:41:15.735 --> 00:41:17.015
By your words, you'll be justified.

835
00:41:17.015 --> 00:41:18.615
And by your words, you'll be condemned.

836
00:41:19.395 --> 00:41:21.375
So that's the the verse that I was quoting there.

837
00:41:21.375 --> 00:41:23.775
And it's, it's saying that God's keeping a record

838
00:41:24.635 --> 00:41:28.455
of every word we say, every tweet, every Facebook posts,

839
00:41:28.475 --> 00:41:31.575
and everything that we ever would verbalize or t

840
00:41:31.635 --> 00:41:33.695
or type in that sense.

841
00:41:34.555 --> 00:41:36.815
So what does Jesus mean when he says, on the day

842
00:41:36.815 --> 00:41:38.135
of judgment, people will give a count?

843
00:41:38.635 --> 00:41:40.735
Is it the, the story, the video

844
00:41:40.835 --> 00:41:43.335
of which I would guarantee most of us have heard

845
00:41:43.335 --> 00:41:45.015
that at some point in our lives in church, right?

846
00:41:45.275 --> 00:41:46.935
The movie's gonna play and you're gonna sit there and watch.

847
00:41:46.935 --> 00:41:48.255
That's a long movie, by the way.

848
00:41:49.515 --> 00:41:51.695
Um, you know, watch everything,

849
00:41:51.735 --> 00:41:52.775
and you're gonna feel so guilty

850
00:41:52.835 --> 00:41:54.615
and ashamed over all those things you did.

851
00:41:54.755 --> 00:41:58.895
And now this is where we get into

852
00:42:00.005 --> 00:42:01.135
some of the rewards

853
00:42:02.075 --> 00:42:04.855
and not rewards for Christians,

854
00:42:05.045 --> 00:42:07.975
that there's judgment seats, plural.

855
00:42:08.755 --> 00:42:11.375
Uh, there's the judgment seat that will be

856
00:42:13.585 --> 00:42:15.125
for the, the goats

857
00:42:15.145 --> 00:42:17.965
and sheep, the, you might say, believers,

858
00:42:17.965 --> 00:42:20.245
non-believers judgment seat, so to speak.

859
00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:23.045
Uh, Jesus talks about, what did you do with me

860
00:42:23.855 --> 00:42:25.805
while you were here away from me?

861
00:42:25.845 --> 00:42:27.485
I never knew you. That's Matthew seven.

862
00:42:27.985 --> 00:42:29.565
So there's that judgment seat.

863
00:42:29.565 --> 00:42:30.965
But then there's also a judgment seat

864
00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:33.565
of rewards for believers.

865
00:42:34.465 --> 00:42:35.725
Now, let me just caveat all this.

866
00:42:35.725 --> 00:42:37.765
The rewards he's talking about is not like we're gonna have

867
00:42:37.835 --> 00:42:39.405
different classes of heaven.

868
00:42:41.355 --> 00:42:42.595
'cause the rewards you get are simply

869
00:42:42.625 --> 00:42:44.675
that you're gonna cast at his feet to worship

870
00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:46.675
and praise God, and you'll just get

871
00:42:46.675 --> 00:42:47.795
a little bit more than somebody else.

872
00:42:47.855 --> 00:42:50.795
But it's not like you're gonna feel if,

873
00:42:50.895 --> 00:42:53.235
if you read the Bible at the end, it says,

874
00:42:53.235 --> 00:42:54.995
there's no more tears, no more shame, no pain,

875
00:42:55.015 --> 00:42:56.275
no more sin, those kind of things.

876
00:42:56.375 --> 00:42:58.955
So we're not saying you're going to feel in a sense,

877
00:42:59.425 --> 00:43:02.585
less than because it,

878
00:43:02.615 --> 00:43:04.985
it's the Lord Jesus is right in front of you.

879
00:43:05.205 --> 00:43:06.625
So you won't feel less than.

880
00:43:06.885 --> 00:43:08.545
But it talks about it in such a way,

881
00:43:08.545 --> 00:43:10.345
and this is even getting to like Hebrews six,

882
00:43:10.805 --> 00:43:11.945
the warning passages.

883
00:43:12.005 --> 00:43:13.185
Can you lose your salvation?

884
00:43:13.615 --> 00:43:17.305
Some of these things, uh, there's a measure of warning there

885
00:43:17.325 --> 00:43:20.345
that's saying, if you could, this is

886
00:43:20.345 --> 00:43:21.665
what it would look like for you to do that.

887
00:43:22.885 --> 00:43:25.265
But since you can't, you don't have to worry

888
00:43:25.265 --> 00:43:27.425
that you're going to it.

889
00:43:27.425 --> 00:43:28.785
It's almost like a hypothetical.

890
00:43:29.015 --> 00:43:32.025
It's not a hypothetical, it's a conditional statement

891
00:43:32.855 --> 00:43:34.225
that assumes it's not true.

892
00:43:35.095 --> 00:43:38.105
There's structures of Greek that that does that

893
00:43:38.845 --> 00:43:40.465
it assumes it to be true at times

894
00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:42.265
and assumes it to be not true at times.

895
00:43:42.805 --> 00:43:45.665
But it still says it as like possibility.

896
00:43:46.695 --> 00:43:48.225
Like, if you could lose your salvation,

897
00:43:48.815 --> 00:43:49.865
this is what it would look like.

898
00:43:50.725 --> 00:43:51.785
But you, you can't.

899
00:43:52.325 --> 00:43:54.825
So I think there's some of that playing into this.

900
00:43:56.015 --> 00:43:56.905
He's talking to

901
00:43:58.905 --> 00:44:02.515
Pharisees, non-believers.

902
00:44:04.095 --> 00:44:06.155
So people will give account for every careless word.

903
00:44:06.155 --> 00:44:08.235
They speak by your words. You'll be justified by your words.

904
00:44:08.235 --> 00:44:10.555
You'll be condemned. Well, are words

905
00:44:10.555 --> 00:44:11.875
that justify us or what?

906
00:44:12.435 --> 00:44:14.595
I spoke everything perfectly throughout all my history.

907
00:44:14.595 --> 00:44:16.115
They play that video and I'm all good.

908
00:44:16.885 --> 00:44:19.515
We're all, we're all done. Nobody does that.

909
00:44:20.415 --> 00:44:22.595
So by your words, you're justified. What are the words?

910
00:44:22.865 --> 00:44:25.195
Confess with your mouth, Jesus' Lord, you'll be saved.

911
00:44:26.255 --> 00:44:27.475
You're justified by that.

912
00:44:28.295 --> 00:44:31.605
You're condemned by your words and everything else.

913
00:44:32.275 --> 00:44:36.165
He's just talking about what they were saying in the moment.

914
00:44:36.315 --> 00:44:38.805
That was the Pharisees, uh, that they were,

915
00:44:38.825 --> 00:44:40.165
it was a demon oppressed man.

916
00:44:40.185 --> 00:44:41.565
And the people were amazed.

917
00:44:41.585 --> 00:44:42.645
And they're, they're saying things.

918
00:44:42.665 --> 00:44:43.765
The Pharisees heard it,

919
00:44:43.865 --> 00:44:47.845
and they said, it's only by alible the prince of demons

920
00:44:47.845 --> 00:44:49.485
that this man casts out demons.

921
00:44:49.905 --> 00:44:52.085
He knew what they were saying even in their minds.

922
00:44:52.585 --> 00:44:55.325
So he's, it's the context that he's,

923
00:44:55.965 --> 00:44:57.725
whatever he was talking about could have been

924
00:44:57.725 --> 00:44:58.885
something different if it was different context.

925
00:44:58.945 --> 00:45:00.885
But he's talking about their words. So he's using

926
00:45:00.885 --> 00:45:01.965
that as the illustration.

927
00:45:02.275 --> 00:45:03.285
Your hearts are wicked.

928
00:45:03.285 --> 00:45:04.645
So that's why you're saying this thing that I'm,

929
00:45:05.105 --> 00:45:06.725
I'm the king of demons, really.

930
00:45:07.875 --> 00:45:09.165
It's because that's in your heart.

931
00:45:09.745 --> 00:45:12.685
So by your words, you're condemned, by your actions,

932
00:45:12.685 --> 00:45:14.525
your lust, you're stealing your,

933
00:45:14.585 --> 00:45:16.445
all these things you're condemned to, just happens

934
00:45:16.445 --> 00:45:17.685
to be in this context, the words.

935
00:45:19.425 --> 00:45:22.245
So he's talking to unbelievers in that moment.

936
00:45:22.505 --> 00:45:24.565
So we have to remember that for that season.

937
00:45:25.105 --> 00:45:27.805
But we can't also get away from these rewards.

938
00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:32.335
He talks about in, uh, where is that First Corinthians?

939
00:45:33.155 --> 00:45:36.175
No, second Corinthians. I dunno.

940
00:45:36.355 --> 00:45:40.055
You have to find it somewhere, um, where

941
00:45:40.845 --> 00:45:42.295
there's the foundation of Christ.

942
00:45:43.155 --> 00:45:45.295
And then it asks, what are you building off that foundation

943
00:45:45.295 --> 00:45:48.095
with, are you building with wood, hay,

944
00:45:48.095 --> 00:45:49.975
and stubble things that are gonna burn up in the end?

945
00:45:49.975 --> 00:45:51.175
Or are you building with gold

946
00:45:51.195 --> 00:45:52.655
and silver and precious stones?

947
00:45:54.075 --> 00:45:55.415
Not literally building a house.

948
00:45:55.625 --> 00:45:57.775
We're not building a heavenly house ourselves.

949
00:45:57.875 --> 00:45:59.455
But what that's talking about is

950
00:46:00.875 --> 00:46:02.415
off the foundation of Christ.

951
00:46:02.415 --> 00:46:04.815
What are we building our lives with, with our way?

952
00:46:04.815 --> 00:46:07.575
We say things, the way we spend our money, the way we

953
00:46:08.145 --> 00:46:09.575
treat our kids, the way we work

954
00:46:09.575 --> 00:46:11.015
with neighbors, like all of that.

955
00:46:11.015 --> 00:46:14.455
Those are all actions that build a house in a sense.

956
00:46:15.235 --> 00:46:17.415
And the judgment, so to speak,

957
00:46:17.475 --> 00:46:19.815
is gonna burn away all the stuff that was not

958
00:46:19.815 --> 00:46:21.895
of God, what's left.

959
00:46:22.835 --> 00:46:26.135
That's then what you'll be rewarded, quote unquote for.

960
00:46:27.835 --> 00:46:31.135
So we shouldn't as believers have to fear that

961
00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:34.775
like an unbeliever would fear the judgment seat

962
00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:37.575
where you will be cast away from God forever,

963
00:46:37.765 --> 00:46:41.215
because that's already been paid for on the cross for us.

964
00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:44.535
We're not there anymore. We're not at this.

965
00:46:46.125 --> 00:46:47.135
Well, you're gonna be justified

966
00:46:47.135 --> 00:46:48.375
or condemned by your words that Jesus

967
00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:49.615
would say to these Pharisees.

968
00:46:49.615 --> 00:46:52.695
We're not there anymore as believers, we're past that.

969
00:46:52.705 --> 00:46:54.735
We're on the justified side already.

970
00:46:54.795 --> 00:46:57.255
So we're now in this state of, this is not a

971
00:46:58.055 --> 00:46:59.375
judgment in a negative sense.

972
00:46:59.375 --> 00:47:00.495
This is a judgment to burn

973
00:47:00.495 --> 00:47:01.695
away all the stuff that's not of me.

974
00:47:01.995 --> 00:47:04.015
And I'm gonna give you my presence forever.

975
00:47:04.315 --> 00:47:06.815
And you get to worship with the stuff that you,

976
00:47:06.815 --> 00:47:08.095
that's left over, you get to worship.

977
00:47:09.195 --> 00:47:10.615
So there shouldn't be a measure of fear.

978
00:47:11.255 --> 00:47:12.255
'cause that's how it's often used,

979
00:47:12.315 --> 00:47:14.255
is you're gonna play this movie up there, you better be.

980
00:47:14.635 --> 00:47:16.615
But, but what kind of gospel is that?

981
00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:20.175
If you play this movie and it,

982
00:47:20.205 --> 00:47:23.495
it's like the scale's balance in your favor based on

983
00:47:23.495 --> 00:47:24.975
how well that movie went

984
00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:28.895
or didn't like, that's not the gospel that is works.

985
00:47:30.595 --> 00:47:32.375
And he balance the scale and makes sure,

986
00:47:32.395 --> 00:47:36.695
and it's just a fear-based inducement of good works.

987
00:47:38.315 --> 00:47:39.415
And those don't save us.

988
00:47:41.305 --> 00:47:43.765
So already saved, already justified

989
00:47:43.865 --> 00:47:45.005
by the words of my mouth.

990
00:47:45.005 --> 00:47:47.045
Confess with your mouth, Jesus' Lord,

991
00:47:48.885 --> 00:47:53.345
my life then is an ambassador, powered by the Holy Spirit so

992
00:47:53.345 --> 00:47:55.025
that I can build a house on the foundation

993
00:47:55.025 --> 00:47:56.185
of Christ that's gonna last.

994
00:47:57.045 --> 00:47:58.665
And he's going to be glorified by that.

995
00:47:58.665 --> 00:48:00.545
And then it's gonna, it's gonna be forever

996
00:48:01.135 --> 00:48:02.905
eternal worship of God.

997
00:48:03.645 --> 00:48:06.985
So we should not fear those kind of things.

998
00:48:07.165 --> 00:48:09.105
And that's an untangling for a lot of us.

999
00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:10.345
I, I felt that too.

1000
00:48:11.285 --> 00:48:14.175
Um, just remember those two separate

1001
00:48:14.185 --> 00:48:15.535
judgements that are coming.

1002
00:48:16.105 --> 00:48:18.015
We're not in this one anymore if we're in Christ.

1003
00:48:18.275 --> 00:48:21.495
So no more fear, no more shame in that. Great question.

1004
00:48:21.625 --> 00:48:25.255
Great. Anything to add Steve to that? Okay. Don't think so.

1005
00:48:25.995 --> 00:48:29.355
I talk too much. Um, or anybody else? What other questions?

1006
00:48:38.445 --> 00:48:41.165
I guess I'd just, uh, just start contemplating this when

1007
00:48:41.165 --> 00:48:44.525
you said it, but, uh, in the last, uh,

1008
00:48:44.615 --> 00:48:47.525
phase when we go to the new heavens and new Earth, right?

1009
00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:52.325
Do we, I guess we lose that ability to send,

1010
00:48:53.265 --> 00:48:54.805
um, we lose free choice.

1011
00:48:55.585 --> 00:48:58.245
We kind of become that robot that people will ask, you know,

1012
00:48:58.245 --> 00:48:59.845
why didn't he just create us as robots?

1013
00:49:01.365 --> 00:49:02.605
I don't know. That's just kind of what I just

1014
00:49:02.605 --> 00:49:03.685
started, started thinking about.

1015
00:49:03.835 --> 00:49:05.325
Yeah. Yeah. Good question. Good question.

1016
00:49:05.785 --> 00:49:10.365
Um, do we lose the ability to choose

1017
00:49:10.655 --> 00:49:12.085
after we're glorified?

1018
00:49:16.965 --> 00:49:21.565
I think when you look at the trajectory of

1019
00:49:22.605 --> 00:49:26.805
creation to new creation, there's

1020
00:49:26.805 --> 00:49:28.885
so many parallels between those two things.

1021
00:49:30.365 --> 00:49:34.145
The garden itself is in a sense, remade the tree

1022
00:49:34.145 --> 00:49:35.465
of life is there.

1023
00:49:36.205 --> 00:49:38.425
So that, that's what's cool about this.

1024
00:49:38.665 --> 00:49:39.985
I could go on a tangent about this.

1025
00:49:40.325 --> 00:49:43.825
Um, two weeks from now, we'll do the last things.

1026
00:49:44.005 --> 00:49:45.505
That's our, one of our big rocks,

1027
00:49:46.175 --> 00:49:47.785
talk about heaven, things like that.

1028
00:49:48.205 --> 00:49:51.345
But the tree of life that they were eating from

1029
00:49:51.535 --> 00:49:52.585
that kept them alive,

1030
00:49:52.615 --> 00:49:56.005
they would've literally lived forever in the garden, created

1031
00:49:56.105 --> 00:49:58.325
to they sinned.

1032
00:49:58.865 --> 00:50:00.885
God chose to kick them out of the garden

1033
00:50:00.885 --> 00:50:02.565
because he didn't want him to eat the tree of life anymore.

1034
00:50:02.905 --> 00:50:06.445
So they died, then he could resurrect them, right?

1035
00:50:06.445 --> 00:50:08.565
So that, it's just never thought about that

1036
00:50:08.625 --> 00:50:09.765
for that's pretty cool.

1037
00:50:10.745 --> 00:50:12.445
What's gonna happen in the new heavens new Earth?

1038
00:50:12.445 --> 00:50:15.345
That tree of life shows back up to

1039
00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:17.225
where we can eat from the tree of life and live forever.

1040
00:50:18.645 --> 00:50:20.185
But the parallels between the two things,

1041
00:50:20.725 --> 00:50:23.665
if we're created the image of God with the choice so

1042
00:50:23.905 --> 00:50:28.335
to speak, then I believe,

1043
00:50:28.335 --> 00:50:30.375
and this, I don't know, I'd have to ask Randy Alcorn

1044
00:50:30.375 --> 00:50:32.615
who wrote the book on heaven, but I think

1045
00:50:33.185 --> 00:50:36.895
there would be a measure of we're unable to sin.

1046
00:50:36.955 --> 00:50:38.695
Not because we're robots, but

1047
00:50:38.695 --> 00:50:42.695
because we have been made new fully our flesh,

1048
00:50:43.185 --> 00:50:45.615
which is the thing that keeps us here,

1049
00:50:46.545 --> 00:50:48.415
still tempted, still sinning.

1050
00:50:48.415 --> 00:50:50.015
We have a new creation spirit,

1051
00:50:50.755 --> 00:50:52.055
but our flesh is still broken.

1052
00:50:53.195 --> 00:50:54.535
So we're still tempted by sin.

1053
00:50:55.205 --> 00:50:58.735
Well, Jesus is the perfect image of God.

1054
00:50:58.835 --> 00:51:01.015
So our bodies will be like his was

1055
00:51:02.845 --> 00:51:04.275
after his resurrection.

1056
00:51:05.725 --> 00:51:09.075
We've been resurrected too. He's the first fruits of that.

1057
00:51:09.975 --> 00:51:14.475
So in a way, we'll have the same ability.

1058
00:51:14.525 --> 00:51:18.315
Jesus had not to unable to sin in that moment.

1059
00:51:18.315 --> 00:51:19.595
There'll be no temptation too.

1060
00:51:19.655 --> 00:51:21.635
So we can't even choose something

1061
00:51:22.025 --> 00:51:23.955
that would lead us towards sin.

1062
00:51:24.615 --> 00:51:27.955
Uh, but, but we also still have to have this ability to say

1063
00:51:28.015 --> 00:51:32.465
to to God, Lord,

1064
00:51:32.485 --> 00:51:33.785
you are, you are worthy.

1065
00:51:34.165 --> 00:51:37.425
And that's not just a, a robot-like thing.

1066
00:51:37.575 --> 00:51:42.305
It's because even though we have new bodies, we still,

1067
00:51:43.025 --> 00:51:44.345
I, again, speculation,

1068
00:51:44.345 --> 00:51:46.945
but I, I still think we'll have a recollection of

1069
00:51:46.965 --> 00:51:51.065
how God has worked in our history, our lives.

1070
00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:54.225
We won't be burdened by the negative.

1071
00:51:54.765 --> 00:51:55.985
We won't be burdened by the sin,

1072
00:51:55.985 --> 00:51:57.545
the temptation, the trauma, the suffering.

1073
00:51:57.545 --> 00:52:00.865
What we'll only be able to see with sanctified,

1074
00:52:01.105 --> 00:52:03.505
glorified eyes is what God wanted us to see

1075
00:52:03.965 --> 00:52:05.185
as he was working it out.

1076
00:52:06.245 --> 00:52:09.785
You know? So the difficult story that

1077
00:52:10.745 --> 00:52:15.435
many have walked through to watch from that side of it

1078
00:52:15.435 --> 00:52:17.515
to see how God, and that's just glory to him.

1079
00:52:17.515 --> 00:52:19.635
That's just worship for what he's done

1080
00:52:20.015 --> 00:52:21.555
to sustain you through this.

1081
00:52:22.695 --> 00:52:24.715
And how that's built everybody else's faith

1082
00:52:24.855 --> 00:52:26.075
as we watch you do that, right?

1083
00:52:26.095 --> 00:52:28.595
So that's the beauty of, I won't forget,

1084
00:52:29.495 --> 00:52:32.675
but I won't remember that series

1085
00:52:32.675 --> 00:52:34.035
of temptations that I gave into.

1086
00:52:34.075 --> 00:52:35.835
I won't remember. It won't do that.

1087
00:52:35.895 --> 00:52:37.355
All I remember is the blood of Christ.

1088
00:52:37.415 --> 00:52:38.995
And I'll remember what he was doing in the middle

1089
00:52:38.995 --> 00:52:43.435
of the things that has to have some sense of agency,

1090
00:52:43.585 --> 00:52:46.715
some sense of choice in that I'm not a robot at that point.

1091
00:52:47.755 --> 00:52:49.915
'cause Jesus wasn't after his resurrection.

1092
00:52:50.315 --> 00:52:51.755
I don't think we would be either.

1093
00:52:52.375 --> 00:52:54.115
So parallels between Genesis one

1094
00:52:54.115 --> 00:52:56.075
and Revelation 22, there's a lot

1095
00:52:56.075 --> 00:52:58.635
that you can learn as you tie those together.

1096
00:53:00.735 --> 00:53:01.975
I was just thinking about, Pick up your

1097
00:53:01.975 --> 00:53:04.535
mic. There you go.

1098
00:53:05.375 --> 00:53:07.375
I was just thinking about Brandon, you talk about, uh,

1099
00:53:10.965 --> 00:53:12.015
when I think about heaven,

1100
00:53:12.395 --> 00:53:14.135
we all have our own thoughts, I guess.

1101
00:53:14.275 --> 00:53:19.095
But for forever, my number one thought about,

1102
00:53:19.995 --> 00:53:24.495
uh, when I go to heaven, who am I gonna see?

1103
00:53:24.675 --> 00:53:25.885
Who am I gonna recognize

1104
00:53:25.905 --> 00:53:28.725
and who's the first person I'm gonna interact with?

1105
00:53:28.865 --> 00:53:32.205
So I never think about my mind being wiped clean

1106
00:53:32.945 --> 00:53:35.045
or my memories are gonna be erased.

1107
00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:36.645
And it's just, but I don't know.

1108
00:53:37.465 --> 00:53:40.965
Uh, but I look forward to obviously that.

1109
00:53:41.345 --> 00:53:46.045
And I think about, uh, you know, my mother, my dad,

1110
00:53:46.345 --> 00:53:48.725
my grandmother, all those types of things I think about.

1111
00:53:49.525 --> 00:53:51.645
I wanna see them. But is that even going to be

1112
00:53:52.275 --> 00:53:54.945
important in heaven?

1113
00:53:55.605 --> 00:53:59.505
And I'm not being, um, negative, I'm just, is

1114
00:53:59.505 --> 00:54:02.745
that gonna be important, uh, in eternity?

1115
00:54:03.005 --> 00:54:05.145
Um, I don't know.

1116
00:54:05.245 --> 00:54:07.705
That's just, that's kind of what I think about One

1117
00:54:07.705 --> 00:54:09.185
of the first things I think about heaven. So

1118
00:54:09.215 --> 00:54:12.665
Yeah, I mean, when the glorified Jesus

1119
00:54:13.185 --> 00:54:14.545
standing right in front of you, it's like,

1120
00:54:15.415 --> 00:54:17.905
will I really care about much else at that moment?

1121
00:54:18.145 --> 00:54:20.065
I don't. So we'll have to see.

1122
00:54:20.165 --> 00:54:22.825
But yeah, good question though. Yeah, thank you.

1123
00:54:22.995 --> 00:54:25.105
Could I add something to that? Yeah.

1124
00:54:25.565 --> 00:54:27.705
I'm thinking about this as a process.

1125
00:54:29.005 --> 00:54:33.625
God allows us to, uh, encounter certain things

1126
00:54:33.645 --> 00:54:38.385
during our life as Christians in order to grow us

1127
00:54:39.285 --> 00:54:42.625
for his purposes and to mature us.

1128
00:54:42.765 --> 00:54:44.945
And as I understand sanctification

1129
00:54:45.005 --> 00:54:49.665
and glorification, glorification is the point

1130
00:54:50.325 --> 00:54:53.785
at which we reach full maturity in Christ.

1131
00:54:56.275 --> 00:55:00.695
And I don't think we'll really want to choose

1132
00:55:01.475 --> 00:55:05.895
things that would dishonor him when we reach

1133
00:55:06.005 --> 00:55:08.095
that full glorification.

1134
00:55:08.325 --> 00:55:10.375
I'll give you an example of something.

1135
00:55:11.315 --> 00:55:14.055
Um, my brother and brother passed away.

1136
00:55:14.115 --> 00:55:16.935
My oldest brother passed away last January,

1137
00:55:19.395 --> 00:55:21.975
and it was very sudden, it was unexpected.

1138
00:55:23.215 --> 00:55:26.795
But Ron had been a follower of Christ for a long time,

1139
00:55:29.445 --> 00:55:32.505
and because of that, um, he,

1140
00:55:35.195 --> 00:55:38.335
he had fallen off of a ladder, hit his head,

1141
00:55:38.515 --> 00:55:41.175
and God gave me a real peace,

1142
00:55:42.335 --> 00:55:46.295
a about Ron being in the presence of God

1143
00:55:47.415 --> 00:55:51.915
before he hit the ground, being in the presence of Christ,

1144
00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:55.475
his savior, whom he dearly loved.

1145
00:55:57.055 --> 00:56:00.115
And all I could think about in those four days

1146
00:56:00.205 --> 00:56:02.035
where they tried to bring him back

1147
00:56:02.135 --> 00:56:05.435
and tried various medical approaches was

1148
00:56:06.545 --> 00:56:08.675
he's in the presence

1149
00:56:09.535 --> 00:56:12.355
of Christ, his savior.

1150
00:56:14.185 --> 00:56:16.435
What an awesome thing.

1151
00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.935
Why would he wanna come back to this world?

1152
00:56:23.265 --> 00:56:26.005
It gave me so much peace

1153
00:56:27.105 --> 00:56:30.285
and so much joy to just think

1154
00:56:31.055 --> 00:56:35.005
about him being in Christ presence.

1155
00:56:36.065 --> 00:56:40.285
And if we understand what it's like to be with Christ,

1156
00:56:41.075 --> 00:56:43.845
with that all encompassing love

1157
00:56:45.425 --> 00:56:49.885
and that all encompassing peace, I don't think we'll want

1158
00:56:49.945 --> 00:56:54.175
to choose something other than

1159
00:56:54.175 --> 00:56:56.415
that would bring him glory. Yeah.

1160
00:56:56.765 --> 00:56:58.415
Yeah. That's, thanks Jan. Thank you.

1161
00:56:58.725 --> 00:56:59.775
That, that reminds me.

1162
00:56:59.875 --> 00:57:02.695
We, you remember we talked about a couple weeks ago, the,

1163
00:57:03.075 --> 00:57:06.295
the incarnation, God, the Son, to nature's one person,

1164
00:57:06.505 --> 00:57:08.135
human nature, divine nature,

1165
00:57:08.805 --> 00:57:11.495
that the human nature was fully submitted in every moment,

1166
00:57:11.505 --> 00:57:13.935
every way perfectly to the divine nature.

1167
00:57:14.155 --> 00:57:17.255
Divine will human will submitted to the divine will.

1168
00:57:18.035 --> 00:57:20.615
So that was part of the question, could Jesus have sinned?

1169
00:57:20.765 --> 00:57:25.335
Well, yes but no. Right?

1170
00:57:25.885 --> 00:57:30.295
He's human, but, but his human will was fully submitted.

1171
00:57:30.295 --> 00:57:31.295
That's where we're gonna be.

1172
00:57:31.295 --> 00:57:32.655
Like Janie was saying, that's where we're gonna be.

1173
00:57:32.655 --> 00:57:36.695
Someday we'll have a renewed nature

1174
00:57:37.515 --> 00:57:41.135
in our humanness to where we'll want nothing

1175
00:57:41.355 --> 00:57:44.375
but to obey and worship and praise,

1176
00:57:44.435 --> 00:57:45.735
and there's no way out of

1177
00:57:45.735 --> 00:57:47.815
that good, the best sense of that word.

1178
00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:51.055
Good. You got anything else? I don't know if it needs

1179
00:57:51.515 --> 00:57:52.775
No, I was just gonna say that, um,

1180
00:57:53.155 --> 00:57:54.335
you're probably gonna talk about some

1181
00:57:54.655 --> 00:57:55.735
resources and things like that.

1182
00:57:56.275 --> 00:58:00.725
Um, a little booklet called The Westminster Shorter Cat

1183
00:58:00.835 --> 00:58:02.605
Chim, I don't think I pronounce it.

1184
00:58:02.795 --> 00:58:05.005
Catechism This, a little booklet, uh,

1185
00:58:06.595 --> 00:58:08.165
very interesting, very good to read.

1186
00:58:08.345 --> 00:58:10.245
And this little short form I would

1187
00:58:10.245 --> 00:58:11.565
encourage you to get, get your copy.

1188
00:58:12.145 --> 00:58:15.405
Um, my daughter gave me this the other day,

1189
00:58:15.485 --> 00:58:16.565
I mean, a couple years ago.

1190
00:58:16.625 --> 00:58:18.925
And, um, just something to put in my pocket.

1191
00:58:19.145 --> 00:58:20.765
So something I would encourage,

1192
00:58:20.905 --> 00:58:21.925
And it's q and a format.

1193
00:58:21.955 --> 00:58:23.365
Yeah, right? They ask a question

1194
00:58:23.985 --> 00:58:26.285
and then answer it with scriptures.

1195
00:58:26.665 --> 00:58:28.605
And so it's sort of a easy way

1196
00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:30.485
to remember things kinda like we do in q and a.

1197
00:58:31.175 --> 00:58:33.765
We've got some of the resources down here, uh,

1198
00:58:34.025 --> 00:58:36.045
one about being created in God's image,

1199
00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:38.125
another one about a theology of sin.

1200
00:58:39.125 --> 00:58:41.525
I mean, just thick book on sin.

1201
00:58:41.555 --> 00:58:43.285
It's like, that's a depressing read,

1202
00:58:43.285 --> 00:58:44.485
but it's really important, right?

1203
00:58:44.485 --> 00:58:45.485
You see why it's important.

1204
00:58:46.025 --> 00:58:47.965
And then a book I, I had forgotten I had it,

1205
00:58:48.105 --> 00:58:49.885
and I, I picked it up the other day.

1206
00:58:50.395 --> 00:58:52.645
It's called Urban Legends of Theology,

1207
00:58:53.855 --> 00:58:55.605
40 Common Misconceptions.

1208
00:58:56.625 --> 00:58:58.565
And so there's some interesting questions in there.

1209
00:58:58.725 --> 00:59:00.605
I don't, I haven't read it all, so I'm not gonna vouch

1210
00:59:00.605 --> 00:59:02.725
for everything in there that we're on board with.

1211
00:59:02.825 --> 00:59:05.685
But, uh, it, it really just pushes on some of the stuff

1212
00:59:05.685 --> 00:59:07.645
that we tend to believe just by default.

1213
00:59:08.635 --> 00:59:11.245
Some of this stuff was Elizabeth was asking earlier

1214
00:59:11.555 --> 00:59:12.685
that we just grew up with,

1215
00:59:12.705 --> 00:59:14.805
and we just never even questioned, never thought about it.

1216
00:59:14.875 --> 00:59:17.365
Like, God won't give me more than I can handle.

1217
00:59:20.065 --> 00:59:23.605
That's not true. He's always gonna give you more than you

1218
00:59:23.605 --> 00:59:25.885
can handle so that you lean on him.

1219
00:59:27.155 --> 00:59:28.645
It's okay. It, it's okay

1220
00:59:28.645 --> 00:59:29.885
that you have more than you can handle

1221
00:59:30.555 --> 00:59:33.005
because he's the one who's strong.

1222
00:59:34.055 --> 00:59:36.215
I boast about my weaknesses, as Paul says second Ians 12.

1223
00:59:36.855 --> 00:59:38.415
'cause in my weakness, he's made strong.

1224
00:59:39.395 --> 00:59:40.535
So that's one of 'em.

1225
00:59:40.655 --> 00:59:43.895
I I know that's in there, just these urban legends,

1226
00:59:43.895 --> 00:59:47.575
you know, that phrase, but just misconceptions.

1227
00:59:48.075 --> 00:59:50.175
So that might be a helpful tool just to get you

1228
00:59:50.175 --> 00:59:51.615
to think differently about some

1229
00:59:51.615 --> 00:59:53.055
of the things you grew up hearing, maybe you

1230
00:59:53.085 --> 00:59:54.935
even believe and hold.

1231
00:59:54.995 --> 00:59:56.495
Now, nothing wrong with that,

1232
00:59:57.275 --> 00:59:59.615
but we want to correct things

1233
00:59:59.635 --> 01:00:01.535
as we can in our own hearts and minds.

1234
01:00:01.715 --> 01:00:03.295
So come take a look at those if you want to later.

1235
01:00:04.115 --> 01:00:06.975
Um, but yeah, good stuff. Thank you again.

1236
01:00:06.975 --> 01:00:11.245
These, these are fun. Uh, just a sweet time to,

1237
01:00:11.265 --> 01:00:13.325
to get together and talk theology

1238
01:00:13.425 --> 01:00:15.565
and see how God wants to change us in.

1239
01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:18.405
So Aaron Ferguson is preaching this Sunday.

1240
01:00:19.475 --> 01:00:22.125
He's preaching on salvation, the big rock of salvation.

1241
01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:24.485
So basically just the gospel, Ephesians two.

1242
01:00:25.105 --> 01:00:26.125
Uh, so pray for Aaron.

1243
01:00:26.425 --> 01:00:28.605
Uh, I'm getting away with my wife for a little bit.

1244
01:00:29.265 --> 01:00:31.005
Pretty tired. So we're excited to get away.

1245
01:00:31.065 --> 01:00:33.445
But, um, yeah, so pray for Aaron.

1246
01:00:33.475 --> 01:00:36.285
Excited there. You good?

1247
01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:37.925
I was gonna pray whenever you're Ready. You

1248
01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:38.765
picked up your bike. I was

1249
01:00:38.765 --> 01:00:39.445
like, you got something else?

1250
01:00:39.515 --> 01:00:41.565
Okay. And I was gonna have you pray, so Perfect.

1251
01:00:41.755 --> 01:00:43.405
Awesome, awesome. Thank you.

1252
01:00:46.205 --> 01:00:49.085
Heavenly Father. We're so grateful for the privilege

1253
01:00:49.185 --> 01:00:51.965
and the freedom that we have together, together tonight, um,

1254
01:00:52.985 --> 01:00:54.965
to share and to talk

1255
01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:59.005
and to, uh, study your word.

1256
01:00:59.385 --> 01:01:02.005
Um, we're thankful for that freedom that we have.

1257
01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:03.525
And Lord, I pray now

1258
01:01:03.525 --> 01:01:06.325
for each person gathered together this evening.

1259
01:01:06.605 --> 01:01:09.325
I pray for their individual concerns and needs

1260
01:01:09.585 --> 01:01:13.285
and, uh, for their health, uh, for things

1261
01:01:13.285 --> 01:01:15.085
that are on their heart, uh, things

1262
01:01:15.085 --> 01:01:16.285
that might be troubling them.

1263
01:01:16.945 --> 01:01:19.765
Uh, Lord, I pray for your comfort for each one of them.

1264
01:01:20.145 --> 01:01:23.685

so much time and prepare in preparation.
