WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.855 --> 00:00:02.345
Good to go.

2
00:00:03.175 --> 00:00:04.385
Okay. All right.

3
00:00:04.385 --> 00:00:06.505
Well, my name is Dan Leaphart,

4
00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:09.305
and I'll be given my testimony here this evening.

5
00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:15.265
Um, unlike most of the people at our church, uh, me,

6
00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:19.465
my wife, we're not from around here, so I grew up in York,

7
00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:23.785
Pennsylvania, and, uh, I'm an only child,

8
00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:26.945
and my mom and dad were, were both Christians,

9
00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.505
and brought me up in a good Christian home.

10
00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:33.465
Uh, my earliest memory that I can remember

11
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.305
is my dad sitting on my bed with me.

12
00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.915
I was about four years old, and he told me about Jesus,

13
00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:43.835
and I remember asking him into my heart that night, uh,

14
00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:45.515
to save me for my sins.

15
00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:48.515
Uh, so my earliest childhood memory,

16
00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:50.355
I don't have any memories really

17
00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:54.275
before, uh, accepting Christ into my life.

18
00:00:55.295 --> 00:01:00.195
Um, I grew up in a church environment my whole life.

19
00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:04.515
We, uh, were not traditionally part of Baptist churches.

20
00:01:04.735 --> 00:01:05.915
Uh, we've always kind of gone

21
00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:07.715
to non-denominational or Bible churches.

22
00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:14.035
Um, and all through my childhood years, I was,

23
00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:17.555
I would say, a good Christian kid.

24
00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:20.315
I love the Lord, love reading his word, um,

25
00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:22.555
through elementary school.

26
00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:26.075
And, uh, talking about Jesus to my friends.

27
00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:28.875
And I guess when I entered into

28
00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:33.275
that middle school time period is when, um, as

29
00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:34.675
with everything else, uh,

30
00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:36.155
people go through a lot of changes.

31
00:01:36.975 --> 00:01:40.595
And I would say at that point in time, uh, I started

32
00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:42.315
to really care more about the world

33
00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:45.755
and what others thought of me, and

34
00:01:46.345 --> 00:01:50.235
therefore, uh, less of what God thought of me.

35
00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:54.035
Uh, still went to church, um, still prayed,

36
00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:56.315
and I would say that continued up

37
00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:58.195
until going off to college.

38
00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:02.515
Uh, so I went off to a four year school undergrad.

39
00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:05.195
My, my degree is in geology, uh,

40
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.315
to a school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

41
00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:08.795
It's only about 45 minutes away.

42
00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:14.775
And I remember when my parents dropped me off,

43
00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.085
uh, in my dorm, um,

44
00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:19.765
they were gonna say goodbye, go back home.

45
00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:22.885
I was gonna start my life there as a college student.

46
00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:25.925
My dad handed me this Bible.

47
00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:29.405
It's an Oswald Chambers Daily Devotional Bible.

48
00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:33.005
And looking back on that time, I, I took it

49
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:34.085
because he was my dad.

50
00:02:34.465 --> 00:02:37.005
Uh, but looking back on that time, I remember being

51
00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:42.135
embarrassed that here I am in a college, um,

52
00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.895
the last thing I really wanted was a Bible.

53
00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:47.135
Um, so what did I do?

54
00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:48.855
I took it back to my dorm room

55
00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:52.455
and I put it into the bottom cupboard of my,

56
00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:54.415
or the bottom drawer in my room.

57
00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.415
And there it would stay for about the next

58
00:02:58.845 --> 00:02:59.845
Four years. So

59
00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:01.565
I'm gonna fast forward a little bit of time

60
00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:05.285
my senior year getting ready to graduate.

61
00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:10.805
And I remember not having a plan for my life.

62
00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.685
Um, I remember, um,

63
00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:17.205
really not knowing

64
00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:21.325
and not being sure what a geology degree is gonna do.

65
00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:24.605
I tried getting jobs. It wasn't, wasn't really working out.

66
00:03:25.465 --> 00:03:29.325
But I did remember one thing I remembered, I had this Bible,

67
00:03:30.385 --> 00:03:32.125
and I remember praying, God,

68
00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:34.325
I know I'm not on a good path here.

69
00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:37.125
What, what is it that I'm supposed to do?

70
00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:39.565
What, what should I actually even read?

71
00:03:40.265 --> 00:03:44.365
And the thing about this 365 daily devotional Bible

72
00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:47.245
is it has daily readings,

73
00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:49.085
and it has old New Testament, psalms,

74
00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:50.365
and proverbs for each day.

75
00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:53.765
And I remember flipping it open

76
00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:56.085
to whatever day that happened to be.

77
00:03:57.105 --> 00:03:59.485
Um, doesn't really matter,

78
00:03:59.545 --> 00:04:02.725
but I remember the proverbs were the shortest part of

79
00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:04.445
that daily scripture reading.

80
00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:08.125
And so I remember reading it, and what did I read?

81
00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:10.085
I read something about the Sluggard.

82
00:04:12.255 --> 00:04:13.795
Um, and I realized

83
00:04:13.845 --> 00:04:16.515
after reading that, that I was that sluggard.

84
00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:20.235
I was like, God, that didn't feel very good,

85
00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:21.675
but I knew I needed it.

86
00:04:22.775 --> 00:04:25.995
So I went the next day, I read the next Proverbs,

87
00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:27.915
I went the next day, read the next Proverbs,

88
00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:32.755
and God was speaking to me

89
00:04:33.465 --> 00:04:35.155
through the proverbs.

90
00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:40.725
And I remember that that was the starting point of

91
00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:45.525
realizing that God had to be more important in my life, um,

92
00:04:45.825 --> 00:04:48.365
all through my senior year and then into summer.

93
00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:50.525
And then I needed an extra semester in the fall.

94
00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:54.405
This was back in 1997 through the summer.

95
00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:56.805
I remember going home and I was at my parents' church,

96
00:04:56.865 --> 00:05:00.325
and I got involved and I was on the worship team, uh,

97
00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:02.005
played the guitar for the worship team.

98
00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:05.455
And in the fall, uh,

99
00:05:05.455 --> 00:05:07.695
we had something called a Country jamboree

100
00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:10.415
where I played the guitar dressed up like cowboy.

101
00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:15.135
And that was the first time that I met Danielle,

102
00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:16.535
who's my, my wife.

103
00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:20.215
And, uh, we got to, to talking.

104
00:05:20.475 --> 00:05:24.615
And, uh, it was January

105
00:05:24.955 --> 00:05:27.495
of 1998 when I got up the nerve

106
00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:29.215
to ask her out for the first time.

107
00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:34.095
We had our first date. And things were going

108
00:05:34.095 --> 00:05:37.735
well until about February when, uh,

109
00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:39.735
I was out late at night in college and,

110
00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:42.385
and, uh, coming back to my apartment

111
00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:45.835
and got into a, a car wreck.

112
00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:49.375
Um, fortunately nobody was hurt.

113
00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:53.535
It was not a major collision. Um, took everybody home.

114
00:05:53.635 --> 00:05:56.805
And, and I remember all that night just

115
00:05:56.865 --> 00:05:59.925
Crying out to the Lord, God,

116
00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.125
I am not on a good path here.

117
00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:05.255
What is it that you want me to do?

118
00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:09.565
I have no idea what I'm gonna do, but I know I need you

119
00:06:10.645 --> 00:06:13.985
and I need you to change this course in my life.

120
00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:20.155
And we'll call that first part of my life. Act one.

121
00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:23.155
From that night on, we'll call it Act two.

122
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:28.915
And I remember things were different after that night.

123
00:06:29.395 --> 00:06:30.515
Danielle and I were still dating.

124
00:06:31.055 --> 00:06:34.515
Uh, by April of that year, we actually got engaged.

125
00:06:34.515 --> 00:06:36.395
So after dating her for three months,

126
00:06:37.315 --> 00:06:40.975
and, uh, we started reading the Bible together,

127
00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:43.575
and we read Genesis one together the next

128
00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:44.775
day, Genesis two together.

129
00:06:44.835 --> 00:06:47.215
And I was like, this isn't fast enough for me.

130
00:06:47.955 --> 00:06:51.345
Uh, God is actually wanting me

131
00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:55.385
to go a little bit, a little bit quicker right now.

132
00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:59.265
So I, I kept reading at my own pace.

133
00:06:59.965 --> 00:07:03.425
Um, by August of that year, uh, we got married.

134
00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:06.265
And what I didn't say between our engagement in April

135
00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:09.785
and our marriage or our wedding in August, uh,

136
00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:11.025
we had an important decision.

137
00:07:11.185 --> 00:07:13.905
I was gonna go on to graduate school for geology,

138
00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:17.005
and I had two options.

139
00:07:17.165 --> 00:07:18.725
I could go to the University of Maryland

140
00:07:18.985 --> 00:07:22.205
or New Mexico Tech now growing up in Pennsylvania,

141
00:07:22.825 --> 00:07:24.135
which makes the most sense.

142
00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:27.675
So we visited both schools, gave 'em an equal shot.

143
00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:31.575
Uh, Maryland offered me a good teaching assistantship,

144
00:07:31.725 --> 00:07:32.775
good, good pay.

145
00:07:33.835 --> 00:07:36.375
And New Mexico did not offer me anything.

146
00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:38.895
So visiting Maryland, I remember the dean

147
00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:40.735
of the geology department asking me

148
00:07:40.735 --> 00:07:42.495
what New Mexico was gonna offer us.

149
00:07:43.115 --> 00:07:45.295
And I said, well, they weren't offering me anything.

150
00:07:45.755 --> 00:07:49.605
And he laughed at me as to why I would even consider them.

151
00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:54.025
And I knew right then

152
00:07:54.025 --> 00:07:56.585
and there that Maryland was not the school

153
00:07:56.585 --> 00:07:57.985
where God wanted us to be.

154
00:07:58.885 --> 00:08:00.865
So the very next day, we prayed about it,

155
00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:03.265
got a phone call from New Mexico Tech.

156
00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:05.665
They offered me actually a better job than

157
00:08:05.665 --> 00:08:07.145
what Maryland was gonna offer us.

158
00:08:07.885 --> 00:08:11.905
So we knew that was where God was leading us to go.

159
00:08:12.005 --> 00:08:15.025
So from Pennsylvania, we got married in August,

160
00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:16.545
came back from the honeymoon,

161
00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:19.225
and we drove all the way across the country to the desert

162
00:08:19.925 --> 00:08:23.265
of New Mexico for two years of graduate school.

163
00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:27.505
And I remember that time getting my degree,

164
00:08:28.085 --> 00:08:31.625
but also God just giving me this unquenchable

165
00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:32.945
thirst for his word.

166
00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:37.525
I read through the Bible for the very first time in my life

167
00:08:37.825 --> 00:08:41.485
at that, at that point, um, when I was done,

168
00:08:41.765 --> 00:08:43.965
I flipped it over and read it again, read it again.

169
00:08:45.155 --> 00:08:48.615
And I could tell that that was just a, a just a period of,

170
00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:52.405
of, of real, real growth

171
00:08:53.525 --> 00:08:55.445
in my walk with Christ.

172
00:08:57.015 --> 00:08:59.675
And two years into that, we got a job

173
00:09:00.295 --> 00:09:03.195
and we moved to the Woodlands, Texas, outside of Houston,

174
00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:07.435
uh, also going to New Mexico, exposed us

175
00:09:07.435 --> 00:09:08.595
to the oil and gas industry.

176
00:09:08.595 --> 00:09:10.715
And that's what I do. That's, that's what I still do today.

177
00:09:11.495 --> 00:09:16.115
And that actually is what brought us here to Oklahoma.

178
00:09:17.045 --> 00:09:20.705
So, uh, going from New Mexico to Houston, while in Houston

179
00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:24.545
for seven years, uh, our three boys were born, all

180
00:09:24.545 --> 00:09:25.705
of them born in, in Texas.

181
00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:30.025
Uh, our oldest is Nathan. He's 23.

182
00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:34.225
He is also now in the graduate program at ou.

183
00:09:34.335 --> 00:09:36.025
He's a math mathematics major.

184
00:09:37.205 --> 00:09:41.185
And Seth, our middle child, uh, he just recently got married

185
00:09:41.285 --> 00:09:43.665
to his wife, Kelly, uh,

186
00:09:43.665 --> 00:09:45.385
who we love our first daughter-in-Law.

187
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:50.465
And he is now a senior at OSU in, uh, strategic, um,

188
00:09:51.885 --> 00:09:53.585
uh, strategic communications.

189
00:09:55.065 --> 00:09:57.445
And Cooper, our youngest is 18,

190
00:09:57.465 --> 00:09:59.325
and he's all the way up in Marquette

191
00:09:59.325 --> 00:10:00.565
University, in Milwaukee.

192
00:10:01.145 --> 00:10:03.725
Uh, he's in the Army, ROTC program,

193
00:10:03.865 --> 00:10:05.765
and he just contracted with the Army.

194
00:10:06.585 --> 00:10:09.325
Uh, so we're, uh, super proud of him,

195
00:10:10.305 --> 00:10:11.765
uh, also.

196
00:10:13.005 --> 00:10:17.905
And so also in that year, those years in Texas, uh,

197
00:10:17.925 --> 00:10:19.825
we went to a Bible church,

198
00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:22.625
and the, the pastor there was a

199
00:10:23.165 --> 00:10:25.185
PhD Greek scholar.

200
00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:30.445
And I remember being so stimulated by that,

201
00:10:30.995 --> 00:10:33.165
that you could have such a, an academic

202
00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:36.285
and such an intellectual approach to God's word,

203
00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:38.965
that there was literally no depth limit to

204
00:10:38.965 --> 00:10:42.405
what you could do, uh, in your, in your study of the Bible.

205
00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:45.365
So during those years, I started to pick up a little Greek

206
00:10:46.905 --> 00:10:50.765
on my own, uh, to go into those deeper dives, into,

207
00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:52.045
into the God's Word.

208
00:10:52.745 --> 00:10:56.765
Um, in 2007, we moved to West Virginia,

209
00:10:57.025 --> 00:10:59.325
had an op opportunity to go there with an oil company.

210
00:11:00.065 --> 00:11:03.125
And, uh, that lasted about two years.

211
00:11:03.185 --> 00:11:07.085
We were happy to be with family or closer to family, uh,

212
00:11:07.145 --> 00:11:09.605
but God brought that to an end in 2009.

213
00:11:10.105 --> 00:11:15.005
And the only job that I had was here in Oklahoma City,

214
00:11:15.655 --> 00:11:16.685
tried to get other jobs.

215
00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:19.245
We did not want to move to Oklahoma City.

216
00:11:20.025 --> 00:11:24.005
Um, but looking back on that now, we know

217
00:11:24.005 --> 00:11:26.125
that was God's plan for us,

218
00:11:26.745 --> 00:11:29.165
and we've grown to love Oklahoma City

219
00:11:29.515 --> 00:11:30.965
shortly after moving here.

220
00:11:31.105 --> 00:11:34.965
We, uh, came, started attending to, uh, uh, Henderson Hills

221
00:11:35.555 --> 00:11:37.605
shortly after attending Henderson Hills.

222
00:11:38.185 --> 00:11:42.845
Uh, we started out in the, uh, Conrad Red Wine flock.

223
00:11:43.395 --> 00:11:45.005
It's back in 2009.

224
00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:48.965
Uh, and after a little bit of time, uh, started

225
00:11:48.985 --> 00:11:51.525
to join the teaching team with Jason Redwine

226
00:11:51.525 --> 00:11:52.685
and, and Eric Harp.

227
00:11:53.825 --> 00:11:56.165
And, um, that was really the start

228
00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:58.845
of me getting into teaching here at the church.

229
00:11:59.145 --> 00:12:03.285
Um, and since then, we've, we've effectively been a part of

230
00:12:03.285 --> 00:12:05.525
that heritage of community group ever since.

231
00:12:06.145 --> 00:12:10.045
Um, Eric Harp and Courtney and Danielle

232
00:12:10.045 --> 00:12:11.805
and myself, we, we spun off,

233
00:12:11.805 --> 00:12:15.965
started a community group back in 2013,

234
00:12:17.245 --> 00:12:20.225
and we are still a part of that community group today.

235
00:12:20.255 --> 00:12:22.905
Eric and Courtney have, have, uh,

236
00:12:23.255 --> 00:12:24.665
left the leadership of that group.

237
00:12:24.725 --> 00:12:26.865
And, and now we're co-leading with, uh, Troy

238
00:12:26.885 --> 00:12:27.905
and Sherry Talley.

239
00:12:29.005 --> 00:12:30.705
Um, just teaching

240
00:12:30.705 --> 00:12:33.425
through the Bible on Sunday morning, second Service.

241
00:12:34.205 --> 00:12:37.655
Um, while here at Henderson Hills,

242
00:12:38.645 --> 00:12:41.295
I've gotten the privilege to lead, you know, several

243
00:12:41.865 --> 00:12:44.655
men's Bible studies, uh, in addition

244
00:12:44.655 --> 00:12:47.925
to teaching in the community group, uh, taught a couple

245
00:12:47.945 --> 00:12:51.645
of HTI classes and then one of my favorites.

246
00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:54.565
Got to teach a short course on Wednesday nights on

247
00:12:54.585 --> 00:12:58.205
how we got the Bible and the history of the revelation

248
00:12:58.225 --> 00:12:59.925
and preservation of God's word.

249
00:13:00.065 --> 00:13:02.365
Uh, one of my, my passion subjects.

250
00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:05.765
Um, but we're at a stage of life right now

251
00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:08.045
where our youngest child is,

252
00:13:08.385 --> 00:13:11.645
has moved off into his college in the beginning of his,

253
00:13:12.105 --> 00:13:13.525
his life, independent.

254
00:13:14.345 --> 00:13:16.285
And we were praying about

255
00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:19.045
how God could use us in this next phase.

256
00:13:20.085 --> 00:13:23.665
And the timing was perfect, uh, to be able to,

257
00:13:23.805 --> 00:13:25.985
to have these conversations about, well,

258
00:13:26.655 --> 00:13:30.065
have we considered eldership here at Henderson Hills?

259
00:13:30.985 --> 00:13:34.005
Um, and we've been praying about

260
00:13:34.005 --> 00:13:35.125
this and praying about this.

261
00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:39.485
And over the last two years, uh, we're, we're convinced now

262
00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:43.645
that God is wanting to use us in this way

263
00:13:43.985 --> 00:13:45.205
to serve this body.

264
00:13:46.105 --> 00:13:48.525
Uh, so I'm excited about it.

265
00:13:48.625 --> 00:13:51.165
Uh, I love this last two years of the,

266
00:13:51.165 --> 00:13:52.765
of the mentoring process, going

267
00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:54.005
through it with Chris and Trevor.

268
00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:55.855
Uh, it's been a joy

269
00:13:56.555 --> 00:13:59.335
and now ready to, to kick off, uh,

270
00:13:59.675 --> 00:14:01.295
the full-time, full-time work.

271
00:14:01.995 --> 00:14:06.415
Um, so, um, we love this church

272
00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:09.815
and we love the Lord and anything we can do to serve,

273
00:14:09.835 --> 00:14:11.655
and I'm just grateful that he's wanting us

274
00:14:11.655 --> 00:14:12.535
to serve in this way.
