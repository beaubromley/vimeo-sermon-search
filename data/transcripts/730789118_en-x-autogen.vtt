1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.400
here

2
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.600
Good morning.

3
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.600
For all of you who don't know me. My name's Alan

4
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.400
Ross, and I've been a Pastor Elder here at Henderson Hills

5
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.400
for 20 years.

6
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.700
I've recently also come to realize that I've officially been preaching

7
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.200
at one church or another for exactly 50 years.

8
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.900
All that together means that I'm old.

9
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.600
Our sermon today is going to start with a little story from

10
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.200
my life back in the 1990s back

11
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.300
when I had hair my lovely wife

12
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.500
Deedee and I bought our first house as a place for two

13
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.200
little daughters to grow up in.

14
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.200
We were poor then but Devi and I took the plunge when

15
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200
we bought a home here in Edmond.

16
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.400
It was a real fixer upper a

17
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
HUD home that no one had wanted for a long time.

18
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.900
A few years passed with a lot of little repairs,

19
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.800
but without a major crisis then one

20
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.700
fine day we noticed there was a crack along

21
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.800
the corner brickwork outside. My

22
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800
daughter's bedroom.

23
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.500
Together we came to the horrifying conclusion that

24
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.400
there was a growing crack in the foundation of

25
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.500
our home.

26
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.800
Oh.

27
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.800
After doing some investigating I found out that our hard red

28
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.200
Oklahoma dirt isn't as hard as it might seem.

29
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.600
The ground beneath us is really a giant sponge that

30
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.000
can dry out and shrink in the Oklahoma sun or

31
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.400
think of it as a giant slab of

32
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.300
uncooked bacon that dries out as it

33
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.000
flies becoming thin and small and crunchy like

34
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.000
the little bookmarks size strips

35
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.500
of bacon on your breakfast plate.

36
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.100
We are experiencing a bad drought at the time in the ground beneath

37
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.400
my house had dried out and it

38
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.700
was taking the corner of my daughter's bedroom

39
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.800
down as it shrunk.

40
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.100
When I found all this out, I was devastated.

41
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.900
Disaster was going to cost us thousands of

42
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.800
dollars to have a foundation or paired company

43
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.300
come in and jack up the corner of that house with

44
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.000
beams or peers.

45
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.100
We didn't have that kind of money.

46
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.400
I was in such shock. I went through the five stages

47
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.200
of grief.

48
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.900
Denial maybe the cracks in the bricks are just cosmetic. Let's

49
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.100
wait a few years and see.

50
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.500
Anger, why is this happening to us? We

51
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.400
just had inspectors checked the foundation of the

52
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.400
house when we bought it. This isn't our vault. It just has

53
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.100
unfair.

54
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.200
Bargaining maybe I can get a shovel and work all summer

55
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.300
and Paul lots of dirt along the outside and that will fix

56
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.800
the problem.

57
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.000
depression

58
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.900
no shovel is going to fix this massive crack

59
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.200
that leads all the way down to Flaming Hades.

60
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.400
We are doomed.

61
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.200
And finally acceptance. Okay. We just got

62
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.500
to make the commitment borrow the money hire a

63
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.000
foundation repair company to fix this disaster.

64
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.800
As I Research Foundation repair companies I discovered there

65
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.500
were two types the cheaper companies who dug a

66
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.100
little deeper into the red Oklahoma dirt and the

67
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.500
more expensive companies who dug all the way down

68
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.700
to the Bedrock which some people call the

69
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.600
living Rock.

70
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.300
Since the ground itself was shrinking it didn't

71
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.200
make any sense to me to go with a company. That was just going

72
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.400
to dig deeper into that shrinking dirt.

73
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.900
So I made the commitment.

74
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.400
Paid out a lot of money and had an

75
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.000
expensive company to dig and go deep

76
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.700
laying the beams directly into

77
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.200
the living bedrock.

78
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.400
When I preach I always like to start with a short simple thesis. So

79
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.400
everyone can follow what I'm trying to say this morning.

80
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.100
My thesis is just seven words long and it's this make

81
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.000
the commitment dig and

82
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.500
go deep.

83
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.400
Our verses for the morning come from the Gospel of Luke chapter

84
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.600
6 verses 46 through 49 just

85
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.700
four little verses where Jesus is preaching his

86
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.500
famous Sermon on the Mount which is the longest

87
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.600
recorded sermon Jesus ever preached.

88
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.400
These four verses are the very last words of

89
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.800
The Sermon on the Mount so they serve as a kind of a culmination

90
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.400
of Jesus's whole sermon a

91
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.800
call to action for his audience to actually do

92
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.300
the things that he is just preached upon.

93
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.200
In this passage Jesus starts out with his

94
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.700
thesis and then he tells a parable to help us understand

95
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.300
the thesis a parable

96
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.500
as you know is a specialty of Jesus. It's a little story

97
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.900
which serves as a sermon illustration.

98
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.800
The story is called a kind of an analogy or allegory

99
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.400
where each literal aspect of

100
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.600
the story often means something figuratively or

101
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.700
symbolically.

102
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.300
As Pastor John has been explaining to us in

103
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.800
this series The Sermon seem like simple often sweet

104
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.300
little stories, but they're really designed to

105
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.700
separate bad thinking and behavior from good

106
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.300
thinking and behavior.

107
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.300
Parables are like a razor-sharp state knife which

108
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.500
Cuts away the bad stuff the fat the

109
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.700
gristle and the bone leaving behind the good

110
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.800
stuff the juicy Cattleman's porterhouse

111
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.300
steak.

112
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.500
So let's read the passage together starting in verse 46.

113
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.700
Why do you call me Lord Lord and

114
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.000
do not do what I tell you.

115
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.300
Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them

116
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.100
I will show you what he's like.

117
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.900
He's like a man building a house who dug deep

118
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.000
and lay the foundation on the rock.

119
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.000
And when a flood arose this dream broke against

120
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.700
the house.

121
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.600
And could not shake it because the house had been

122
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.400
well-built.

123
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.200
But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man

124
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.900
who built a house on the ground without a foundation.

125
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.400
When the stream broke against it immediately it

126
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.400
fell and the ruin of that house

127
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.200
was great.

128
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.700
As you can see Jesus starts with his thesis in

129
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.300
verse 46. Why do you call me

130
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.500
Lord Lord and do not do what I

131
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.000
tell you.

132
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.300
The New Testament was written in ancient Greek and the Greek word for Lord

133
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.600
here is carry.

134
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.700
At the lowest level Lord just means someone in

135
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.600
authority over you who you are to obey like a

136
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.600
military commander or a king.

137
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.500
But at the highest level the word carrier Lord

138
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.400
is often used interchangeably in the New Testament

139
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.500
with the word god.

140
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.300
as it is in John 20:28 when Thomas

141
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.200
finally realizes that he's speaking to the actual resurrected Jesus

142
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.800
and Thomas exclaimed my

143
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.800
Lord and my God.

144
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.700
Therefore Jesus is our King, but he's

145
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.100
also our almighty God.

146
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.900
He has the authority to tell us what to do.

147
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.100
So why listen to Jesus Lord means king and

148
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.700
it means god?

149
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.600
Jesus' point is that there were people hanging out with him pretending

150
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.200
to be as followers, but they weren't doing the things.

151
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.900
Jesus was telling them to do.

152
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.700
Jesus is pointing out the obvious contradiction in their

153
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.000
lives. He was in effect using the parable to

154
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.200
separate the disobedient Pretender followers

155
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.500
cutting them out like fat and gristle and

156
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.800
Bone separating them from the porterhouse state

157
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.600
of those true followers who were

158
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.600
obedient to his words.

159
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.000
sometimes Jesus will explain the elements

160
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.300
or the parts of the Parables letting

161
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.300
this disciples know what each literal thing

162
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.500
in the story represents symbolically or

163
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.400
allegorically

164
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.000
But Jesus doesn't do that here.

165
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.600
So during the course of this sermon we have to explore what the following story

166
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.500
elements really mean one the builders.

167
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.400
the houses

168
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:43.800
the stone

169
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.500
the sand

170
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.000
the flood

171
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.800
Let's start with the builder who was the builder?

172
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:52.800
the builders you

173
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.800
the builders meet

174
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.900
everyone who ever lived the Builder

175
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.300
Lucas not the only gospel writer to record

176
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.400
this Parable Matthew also records a version of this Parable

177
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.000
in Matthew 7 verses 24 through 27.

178
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.400
Both Matthew and Luke make it obvious. The Builder is all

179
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:11.700
of us.

180
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.900
What is interesting is that Luke goes into more detail

181
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.600
than Matthew does and Luke's

182
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.500
version is also much more intense.

183
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.300
In Matthew simpler version as readers, we get

184
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.000
the general impression that over there is a chunk of Bedrock sticking

185
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.200
up and one guy builds this house

186
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.100
on that. And another direction is a stretch of

187
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.700
sand and the other guy builds his house on that.

188
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.100
In Luke's more detailed version, however, there's digging involved.

189
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.200
Verse 47 everyone who comes to me and hears my word

190
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.400
and does them I will show you what he's like, he's like

191
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.800
a man building a house who dug deep and

192
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.200
laid the foundation on the rock.

193
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.300
So when we analyze Luke's version of the parable

194
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.500
we see there are two types of ground one,

195
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.500
which is rock and one which is sand rather.

196
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.800
We see only one type of ground that both

197
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.100
men are building upon it is

198
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.600
Sandy ground with bedrock deep down

199
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.300
underneath the sand.

200
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.000
So the difference between the two Builders is not where

201
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.600
they chose to build but how

202
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.900
they chose to build. So Matthew emphasizes

203
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.000
where to build Luke emphasizes how

204
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.700
to build

205
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.400
In Israel in the first century and I think sometimes even

206
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.700
today heavy rains would fall in September

207
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.500
which caused all the dry riverbeds to

208
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.400
become torrential floods.

209
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.800
after these floods passed they would cause the ground on

210
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.000
the banks of the dry River beds to become flat

211
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.900
and clear and hard like

212
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.900
concrete making it an ideal location

213
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.600
for building houses when summertime

214
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.200
rolled around

215
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.600
The obvious problem is that a few months later. The September

216
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.500
rains would come around in the dry. River beds

217
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.400
would become a torrential flood once again

218
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.500
washing away any house built on

219
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.900
that treacherous sand.

220
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.600
The only way around the problem is for the Builder to dig and

221
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.600
go deep placing the buildings

222
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.500
Foundation directly on the living bedrock.

223
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.400
This would cause the seasonal torrential flood simply

224
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.400
to flow around the house without doing any

225
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.200
damage at all.

226
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.400
in 1838 Bible researcher, Edward

227
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.200
Robinson

228
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.200
Stayed in what is now Israel in a home that had

229
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.800
just been built and the builder at that time had

230
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.900
been forced to dig a stunning thirty feet

231
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.300
down through the sand to hit the

232
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.100
living bedrock.

233
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.300
Luke describes this exact process when he writes in verse

234
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.900
38 that the Builder on the rock

235
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.500
dug deep and laid the

236
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.900
foundation on the rock.

237
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.300
The English phrase Doug deep is really just one verb here.

238
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.800
But in the Greek of the New Testament, it's two verbs. It is

239
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.200
Doug and kept deepening.

240
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.800
Or another way of saying it is Doug and went deep.

241
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.400
So that's why I've worded our thesis for the day as make the

242
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.300
commitment dig and go deep emphasizing

243
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.900
the meaning of the Greek.

244
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.500
So Luke emphasizes digging and

245
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.600
going deep.

246
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.300
So what is the house?

247
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.600
The house is your life.

248
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.000
It is your main purpose in

249
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.400
life.

250
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.500
As we just seen Luke goes in more detail than

251
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.300
Matthew did.

252
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.100
But now we'll see that Luke also uses more intense

253
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.500
language.

254
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.700
The Holy Spirit inspired the writers of the Bible, but

255
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.300
he used their own personalities their

256
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.700
own vocabulary in their own writing styles to

257
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.900
express God's perfect inerrant word.

258
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.800
most of the writers of the New Testament were common men

259
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.700
like fishermen

260
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.800
But Luke is an educated man.

261
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.500
Luke is a medical doctor a physician

262
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.700
So God uses Luke's knowledge of medicine

263
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.200
to enrich the meaning of the

264
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.000
words of the Bible.

265
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.100
Luke makes it obvious that the house and the parable is to be

266
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.300
associated with your life with my life

267
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.500
because he describes the house.

268
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.700
Using medical terms that describe the

269
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.400
human body.

270
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.300
Luke uses four medical terms for

271
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.400
the human body In this passage and each time. He

272
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.900
uses one of these terms they're the only time the

273
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.700
words are used in the entire Bible.

274
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.400
So what is the flood in a general sense the

275
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.700
flood represents events or crises that

276
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.900
test your life?

277
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.200
your reason for living

278
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.100
So let's read verse 49 again, and I'm going

279
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.000
to emphasize those four words.

280
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.200
but the one who hears and does not do them is like

281
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.900
a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation when

282
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.900
the Stream

283
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.200
Broke against it immediately it fell.

284
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.200
And the ruin of that house was great.

285
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.500
The word stream physician Luke uses here as

286
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.900
a Greek word plumerous.

287
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.500
Which is a medical term when the internal body

288
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.500
fluids are gushing and overwhelming.

289
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.200
the whole body

290
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.200
As my dad lie in a hospital bed his lungs

291
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.000
filled up with fluid.

292
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.300
His surgeon performed an operation to drain my

293
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.400
dad's lungs, but the flood came again the next day and filled his

294
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.900
lungs all the way up again.

295
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.400
The surgeon told me he couldn't stop the flood.

296
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.500
He told me to say goodbye to my dad.

297
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.400
So Devi and I held each one of his hands on

298
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.500
either side of the bed.

299
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.200
And we're saying to him and we prayed for him

300
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.600
as he passed away.

301
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.400
Luke is saying that a flood is coming for all of

302
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.300
us and we can't stop it.

303
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.600
When the passage states that the blood the flood broke against

304
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.200
the house.

305
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.500
Physician Luke uses the word proserasan which is a medical

306
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.400
term to describe a rupture of the

307
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.400
veins a powerful explosion of the

308
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.000
veins.

309
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.700
A tragic example of this is an a

310
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.400
bursting or an explosion of a vein

311
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.800
in the brain and that's called an aneurysm.

312
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.900
Those ruptures break against the houses of those sufferers lives

313
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.200
was such force that that

314
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.000
explosion often causes them to pass away almost

315
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.700
immediately.

316
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.300
When the passage states that the house fell Luke

317
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.700
uses a Greek word a passion,

318
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.500
which is a medical term for a collapsing in

319
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.400
or falling in of the parts of the body.

320
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.400
Perhaps like when the rib cage is crushed and

321
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.400
it collapses the lungs.

322
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.400
Finally when the passage States and the ruin of that

323
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.800
house was great for the word ruin physician.

324
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.600
Luke uses the word ragma, which

325
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.900
is a medical term for a complete rupture

326
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.200
of the whole body. Perhaps like

327
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.600
when a landslide completely crushes the human body

328
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.200
into its component elements. So there's

329
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.600
really almost nothing left.

330
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.600
Let me emphasize again that these are powerful even

331
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.800
explosive medical terms related to

332
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.600
the human body related to the house and

333
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.000
for all four words. They're the only

334
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.300
time they occur in the Bible.

335
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.300
Lucas getting the readers here to feel like we are

336
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.300
in a 3D movie having the houses of

337
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.100
Our Lives Rock by the sheer power of

338
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.800
this flood and the flood as it

339
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.300
broke.

340
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.200
And the house fell.

341
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.900
And the whole thing was a ruin.

342
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.500
We want to pretend that no flood.

343
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.300
Is coming in our lives?

344
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.400
Luke is using explosive words to make us feel the

345
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.500
power of the coming flood.

346
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.200
So that we will be wise and build upon

347
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.900
the living Rock.

348
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.000
So Luke emphasizes the power and the destruction of

349
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.500
the flood.

350
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.500
What is the sand? What is The Rock?

351
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.400
It is what you choose as the meaning as the

352
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.200
foundation of your life.

353
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.700
What is the meaning of life?

354
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:08.600
Why are you here?

355
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400
What is your purpose?

356
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.000
on this Earth

357
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.200
This is perhaps the most Central most essential question

358
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.800
in the history of humanity. If you

359
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.800
look at a poll of all the people in the world, that would

360
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.600
have a lot of different answers to what is

361
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.400
the meaning of life. Someone say

362
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.800
it's the pursuit of happiness.

363
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.100
Someone say pleasure.

364
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.300
Someone say oh You Need Is Love

365
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.200
Edmund someone say it's all about family.

366
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.400
It's all about work calming the ladder of

367
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.500
success or power or influence or

368
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:48.900
money.

369
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.500
Fame

370
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.100
someone say it's education in the life of the mind

371
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.400
or maybe the Arts and the humanities.

372
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.300
The saddest of us would say that it never occurred to us

373
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.700
to ask the question. What is the meaning of life?

374
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.800
Sometimes I'm known for saying the phrase.

375
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.500
Let's imagine a world where someone made the commitment but

376
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.000
to solve this mystery of what is the meaning of life?

377
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.100
Let's imagine they conducted a series of grand scientific

378
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.900
experiments to test every possible

379
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.800
answer to the meaning of life to see what

380
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.000
the end result is.

381
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.300
But interestingly we don't have to imagine such a

382
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:33.600
person.

383
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.700
Because he actually existed and is Grand experiment is recorded

384
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.200
in the pages of the Bible.

385
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.900
3,000 years ago King Solomon undertook a

386
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.700
scientific experiment and carefully records

387
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.200
his findings in the Old Testament book

388
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.800
of Ecclesiastes.

389
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.700
Now Solomon is uniquely qualified for this Monumental task.

390
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.200
He's the wisest man ever to live except for

391
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:01.400
Jesus.

392
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.100
He's Supreme and knowledge and scholarship. He's the greatest

393
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.200
King Israel ever had.

394
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.200
And he's richer than Elon Musk.

395
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.300
He's approach to solving the mystery of the meaning of life was to

396
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.300
take each Endeavor and to do it with all of his heart and

397
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.700
all of his resources and then to analyze its

398
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.200
ultimate value.

399
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.400
He threw himself into knowledge and scholarship and a pleasure

400
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.800
and fun. He mentions alcohol into work.

401
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.900
He built massive building projects like the first temple

402
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.500
and the Magnificent Palace.

403
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.900
He wielded ultimate power as king taking Authority

404
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.400
even over other kingdoms.

405
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.600
He accumulated vast riches he's sponsored

406
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.000
music and the Arts.

407
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.000
He threw himself into love and romance, perhaps

408
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.500
like no person ever has or should.

409
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.400
He had a thousand ladies to

410
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.100
fall in love with.

411
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.100
700 wives and 300 other women who kind of

412
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.500
played the role of wives

413
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.400
What is Solomon's conclusion from his

414
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.300
exhaustive and probably exhausting research?

415
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.100
He judges each candidate to the answer of

416
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.300
the meaning of life with his famous phrase.

417
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.700
vanity of vanities all is

418
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.300
vanity

419
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.600
Every one of these patches of sand however good

420
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.600
they are in and of themselves are all a

421
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.600
horrible and tragic ruin as an answer to

422
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.200
the meaning of life.

423
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.700
Every one of them is a disaster a

424
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.100
complete and utter.

425
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.500
devastation

426
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.500
Solomon concludes therefore most everything

427
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.600
is sand utterly worthless as the

428
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.000
foundation of life.

429
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.700
So now it's time to address you as the Builder

430
00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.700
in this parable.

431
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.200
I ask this Universal question to you and I want

432
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.700
you to think seriously about it.

433
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.000
Why are you on this planet?

434
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.500
What is your purpose?

435
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.000
What is your meaning in life you're Foundation?

436
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.300
your highest priority

437
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.400
Let's look at Solomon's conclusion to his research into

438
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.000
the meaning of life. These are the very last words of the

439
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.300
Book of Ecclesiastes in chapter 12.

440
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.400
the end of the matter

441
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.500
all has been heard.

442
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.400
Fear God and keep his Commandments for this

443
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.600
is the whole duty of man.

444
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.500
For God will bring every deed into judgment

445
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.800
with every secret thing.

446
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.200
whether good

447
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.600
or evil

448
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.500
So when you dig down through the 30

449
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.800
feet of sand the distracting sand and you

450
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.500
get to the bottom of the shaft. What is the living

451
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.400
Rock The Living rock is God himself?

452
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.500
The living rock is Jesus Christ?

453
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.200
Solomons conclusion sounds an awful lot like

454
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.200
the Westminster Shorter Catechism, which a lot of us know around

455
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.200
here written in 1647 which encapulates all

456
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.100
the Bible in just a few words.

457
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.600
Hear the opening words of that catechism question one.

458
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.400
What is the chief end of man?

459
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.900
Answer man's Chief end is to glorify

460
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.500
God and enjoy him forever

461
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.200
to glorify God and enjoy

462
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.700
him forever.

463
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.900
So God is the only Bedrock Foundation.

464
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.400
for our lives

465
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.000
Simply put our purpose as human beings the reason for

466
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.500
our existence and the meaning of Our Lives

467
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.500
is to be in harmony.

468
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.800
with God our maker

469
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.500
and our creator

470
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.200
our purpose is to worship God and enjoy him

471
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.800
forever.

472
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.400
the main part of the word enjoy

473
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.300
Is the word Joy?

474
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.700
We are designed to be an absolute harmony with

475
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.500
God in absolute Joy with God

476
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.800
that is what God wants for us. And

477
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.300
that is what he is always wanted for us.

478
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.800
the bad news

479
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.300
The only way to have harmony with God

480
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.300
is to be absolutely sinless just like

481
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:35.600
him.

482
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.200
God is so perfect. So holy that he

483
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.500
cannot have harmony with people like

484
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.200
us who are sinful who do things say

485
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.300
things and think things that are

486
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.800
less than his absolute moral

487
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.700
holiness.

488
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.900
We're like Adam and Eve and that we choose to disobey

489
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.800
God. We choose other gods other

490
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.900
patches of sand to worship, especially worshiping

491
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.400
ourselves

492
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.300
because we fall infinitely short of God's absolutely holiness.

493
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:14.800
we all

494
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.200
all human beings

495
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.100
all of us are at war with God.

496
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.500
So we naturally seek to build the houses

497
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.800
of Our Lives on different patches different colors

498
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.700
different textures of sand the

499
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.300
sand work.

500
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.200
money

501
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.000
love

502
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.000
family

503
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.200
entertainment

504
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.100
Sports

505
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.000
pleasure

506
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.200
So, how do we get out of this horrifying curse?

507
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.400
That's the point.

508
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.100
We can't.

509
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.500
We need someone to save us from our sins

510
00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.300
and from ourselves.

511
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.400
Now for the good news, I use that phrase good

512
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.300
news. The main message of Christianity is also called

513
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:06.800
The Gospel.

514
00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.200
Jesus Christ is the one holy

515
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.300
sinless human being who was

516
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.500
always in perfect harmony with God.

517
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.500
That is because Jesus himself is

518
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.500
God. He's a hundred percent God and a

519
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.700
hundred percent human at the same time.

520
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.700
Because he is sinless and perfect. He

521
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.900
is the only person who is qualified to

522
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.400
become a sacrifice for us to

523
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.500
take away our sin.

524
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.700
He died on the cross for us.

525
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.700
So that if we believe in him if we call on

526
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.400
him as Savior if we make him the Lord

527
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.500
Of Our Lives he will forgive us all of

528
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.100
our sin past present and future.

529
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.600
And we become a part of God's family.

530
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.900
We establish our houses Our Lives

531
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.000
upon the living bedrock.

532
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.100
We become saved and we get to

533
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.900
experience a relationship with a real and living person

534
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.500
Jesus.

535
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.800
We can be in harmony with God in our

536
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:23.800
lives.

537
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.500
This harmony with God is the good life that

538
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.200
we all imagine that we all dream of

539
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.600
that we all strive for.

540
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.400
Don't misunderstand. We're still going to have hardships and

541
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.600
tragedies in our lives.

542
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.300
Those torrential rains are going to fall. The flood is

543
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.000
going to come just like they did in Israel every September.

544
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.800
But even in the middle of that flood we can have inner peace

545
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.800
and a Wellspring of joy.

546
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.800
Jesus says in John 10:10, the thief comes

547
00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.300
only to steal and kill and

548
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.100
destroy I came that. They

549
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.200
may have life and have it up abundantly

550
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.100
in the Greek. It's super

551
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.400
duper abundantly.

552
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.100
Chronicle 16 for grade is the

553
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.600
Lord and greatly to be praised and he is to be held in

554
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.700
All Above All Gods.

555
00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.000
For all the gods of the people are idols.

556
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.300
But the Lord made the heavens.

557
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.300
Splendor and Majesty are before him

558
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.000
strength and Joy are in

559
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.000
his place.

560
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.600
and then Jesus says

561
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.200
in John 15 these things I have

562
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.600
spoken to you that my joy may be

563
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.000
in you and that your joy may

564
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.400
be full.

565
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.200
when we look at the Builder who built his house on the

566
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.300
sand and the flood zone we think what

567
00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.400
were you thinking?

568
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.300
There's a lot.

569
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.200
Is in September, duh?

570
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.700
And yet we ourselves prioritize things in

571
00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.500
life. We build our foundation on things other

572
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.500
than Jesus and we assume no flood is

573
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.900
ever going to come?

574
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.600
So what does the flood symbolize specifically theologians

575
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.900
focus upon four things one the

576
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.600
last judgment?

577
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.200
The Bible tells us that the end of time we will

578
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.700
all stand before God before his

579
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.200
judgment seat and give an account to

580
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.700
him about what we chose as the foundation.

581
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.200
of our life

582
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.200
At that time we're all going to wish we had built upon the

583
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.100
living Bedrock of Jesus.

584
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:48.700
death

585
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.900
everyone who has ever lived.

586
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:53.700
faced death

587
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.400
We're going to face death one day.

588
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.300
For some reason we all work together

589
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.800
to try to pretend that really isn't going to happen.

590
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:04.600
Why?

591
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.100
Many people at the end of their lives look back and mourn on how

592
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.500
they wasted their lives building their houses on the sand.

593
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.600
In the 1980s. It was a common saying that he who dies

594
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.100
with the most toys wins.

595
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.100
But real people on their deathbeds look at all their toys and they

596
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.100
say to themselves.

597
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.500
Vanity of vanities all is Vanity.

598
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.000
All a ruin a total disaster.

599
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.600
And facing death were all going to wish we had built Our Lives upon

600
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.200
the living Bedrock of Jesus.

601
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.200
three

602
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.300
crises in life

603
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.300
crises like floods. They're just

604
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:47.500
going to come.

605
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.600
I personally have experienced a stunning degree

606
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.200
of crises in my life.

607
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.200
Christies have a way of making and doing an analysis of

608
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.100
your life Foundation to judge what it's really

609
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:00.400
worth.

610
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.600
Maybe cancer or some other deadly illness has

611
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.200
threatened your very life.

612
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.400
Maybe you lost your money in the stock market and it's

613
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.700
left you in despair.

614
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.200
Maybe the love of your life betrayed you

615
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.400
and left you leaving you crushed.

616
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:19.600
and broken

617
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.200
only in Jesus is our foundation secure for

618
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.900
all eternity.

619
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.700
And then number four emptiness and unfulfillment

620
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.200
in life.

621
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.000
Sometimes even in the middle of life. We find

622
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.200
that what we have selected as our foundation is

623
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.800
deeply unfulfilling.

624
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.200
We feel restless and achy and empty.

625
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.400
We see this in popular songs.

626
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.600
1965 the Rolling Stones, I

627
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.900
can't get no.

628
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.600
Status faction though. I

629
00:32:59.600 --> 00:32:59.900
try

630
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.700
two decades later 1987 Bono U2,

631
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.100
but I still haven't found

632
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.000
what I'm looking for.

633
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.000
2002 two decades later Johnny Cash

634
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.400
version of Nine Inch Nails

635
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.200
and you could have it all.

636
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.500
my Empire of dirt

637
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.200
will let you down.

638
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.300
I will make you.

639
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:40.800
know now

640
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:45.900
That's just sad.

641
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.000
aching emptiness causes all of us to wonder

642
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.100
Is that really all there is to life?

643
00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.200
In the moment that Jesus is telling this Parable what

644
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.100
do the builders on the sand and the parable represent? The builders

645
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:07.000
represented people who seem to be Christians on

646
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.900
the outside, but who really are not

647
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.800
In this room right now are people who know they're

648
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.600
not Christians.

649
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.800
They're just pretending they're living a lie.

650
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.800
Also, there are people in this room who may be confused diluted

651
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.200
into thinking that they're Christians, but at some

652
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.300
level deep down they've got to know that Jesus isn't the real Foundation of

653
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.800
their lives.

654
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.500
Right. Now you are building your lives on something

655
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.400
every one of us.

656
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.200
Do you even know what it is?

657
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.100
And if you know what you're building your life upon.

658
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.000
Do you like your decision?

659
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.800
How is it working out for you now?

660
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.000
And how will it work out for you when the

661
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.500
flood comes?

662
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.500
So what happens to the two Builders builders on the sand

663
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.300
are going to end very badly.

664
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.400
dig and go deep

665
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.600
I'm a Pastor Elder here at Henderson Hills on the side been

666
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.300
in my paid profession if you can believe it. I'm an English professor.

667
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.300
Sometimes I have freshman students who never hang in an

668
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.700
assignment never study and almost never come to class.

669
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.300
When I see them exhibit this Behavior, I pull

670
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.100
them aside in private, and I generally ask them a few

671
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.300
questions.

672
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.100
What are you doing?

673
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.700
Why are you here?

674
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.700
I tell them that going to University is very expensive. They want

675
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.500
to slack off and do nothing in life. They don't have to pay College

676
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.700
tuition to do that.

677
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.200
I tell them there's going to be a reckoning at the end of

678
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.700
the semester a flood is coming. They're

679
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.200
going to get an F in all their classes and they're

680
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.900
gonna fail out of University.

681
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.000
Pretending to be a student. It's going to be a really short

682
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.900
ride for them.

683
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.500
There's some people in this room right now who seem Christian

684
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.700
on the outside, but who's never personally made Jesus

685
00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.400
their lord the foundation of their lives.

686
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.800
I would gently ask you these questions.

687
00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.300
What are you doing?

688
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.400
Why are you here?

689
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.200
What do you get out pretending to be

690
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:21.600
a Christian?

691
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.100
Why not dig and go deep into the

692
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:29.200
living Bedrock of Jesus Christ and actually become a

693
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.700
Christian.

694
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.600
There is a flood coming for all of us.

695
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.000
If you haven't given your life to Jesus, it's all a disaster.

696
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.000
complete and utter devastation

697
00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.500
It's okay to go through the five stages of grief

698
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.100
like I did.

699
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:48.400
with my house

700
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.900
Let's go back to the story about my House's crack Foundation.

701
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.200
You might want to know how everything turned out.

702
00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.400
I believe that in hindsight Devi and I we made

703
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.000
a good decision because in all the decades since then we've

704
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.200
never had a problem with that Foundation.

705
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.400
In fact, I felt comfortable enough with the condition of that house

706
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.500
that I didn't give it a second thought when I sold that

707
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.200
house to my own son and law Fergie and my

708
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.400
daughter Sheriff.

709
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.400
Just a few years ago.

710
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.500
My two glorious granddaughters Elliot and

711
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.800
Charis are making all their childhood memories

712
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.600
right there in that home just like

713
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.100
my daughters did.

714
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.300
What will your legacy be when you

715
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.800
dig and go deep?

716
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.300
When you have harmony with God and he's flowing

717
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.400
through you what will be the impact upon those around

718
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:45.700
you.

719
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.200
those you love

720
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.400
dig and go deep to the Bedrock Foundation of

721
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:52.700
Jesus.

722
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.200
What about those of us who are too true Christians who've dug deep

723
00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.700
and went down to the living Rock. Do we sometimes become

724
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.300
fixated on the sands?

725
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.400
I have a filthy confession to make to you I do.

726
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:08.900
We all do.

727
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.300
That's why we sometimes don't do what Jesus tells us

728
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.300
to do. But Jesus is thesis in this

729
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.000
Parable tells us that we must be doers of the

730
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.800
word and not just hearers like his brother. James said

731
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.500
So how do we as Christians dig and go deep? The answer

732
00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.600
is that we need to grow as Christians

733
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.400
over time in a process that the

734
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.100
Bible calls sanctific.

735
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.400
Ation, so builders on the Rock can melt even deeper with

736
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.500
the Bedrock through scientification.

737
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.100
That's why we need the holy spirit in our hearts

738
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.700
to guide us and to disciple us. That's why we

739
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.200
need the church. That's why we need

740
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.000
each other.

741
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.700
Christianity is not a solo sport.

742
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.200
Christianity is a team sport.

743
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.400
That's why we pray and we read the Bible and we

744
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.200
engage in sermons together and we

745
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.900
connect together in community groups and serve and

746
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.900
give and love.

747
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.400
The goal over time is to fixate less and less upon

748
00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.500
the Sands and to rest more and more

749
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.500
upon the living Bedrock Jesus

750
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.500
so that we look more and more

751
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.600
like Jesus over time.

752
00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.200
For us as Christians meditating upon this Parable helps

753
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.400
us to reorient our minds, especially in the chaos

754
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.300
of Summer to what is true and

755
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.700
good and best.

756
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.200
I seem to be known in this church as the preacher who

757
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.100
uses props in his sermons.

758
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.100
You might have thought you're going to get out of this sermon without a prop

759
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:50.800
and no such look.

760
00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.300
As our previous lead teaching Pastor Dennis

761
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.500
new Kirk used to say some people think that

762
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.100
life.

763
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.400
Is like a cafeteria tray?

764
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.200
So this is what they do they say, okay, this is

765
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.500
family and this is material possessions.

766
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.700
And this is fun. And this is work. And

767
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.200
this is round we'll put Jesus right there and

768
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.700
we have a whole life.

769
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.300
But all these things are things that

770
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.600
Jesus has given us family and work

771
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.900
material possessions fun and so on. Why would

772
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.600
we put them equal with Jesus?

773
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.500
So that's the wrong notion. What is the right notion? The

774
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.800
right notion is that the cafeteria tray

775
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.100
itself is Jesus.

776
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.000
He is the foundation of everything in our

777
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.500
lives.

778
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.500
And the things in here family and money

779
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.800
and pleasure and work and all that stuff is what

780
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.200
he gives us and we look to him for

781
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.000
which order to put them in the right proportion at the

782
00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.700
right amount. So it has the best effects in

783
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.200
our life for the good life.

784
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.500
Only through Jesus are these things

785
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.200
given the proper place in our

786
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:08.600
lives.

787
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.900
Sand is awesome.

788
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.700
Sand is why many of us go to the beach in the summer?

789
00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.200
But sand is not designed to be a God for

790
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.100
us to worship.

791
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.200
We are to make a commitment. We are to dig

792
00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.500
and go deep all the way down to the living Bedrock. That

793
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.200
is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

794
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.300
Whoever you are.

795
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.500
Whether you're a Christian or not today.

796
00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.500
Today is a really good day to make a commitment

797
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.000
to draw closer to Jesus.

798
00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.400
The Holy Spirit may be working deep in you to make Jesus

799
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.500
the foundation of your life or to help you

800
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.000
to meld deeper to that Foundation.

801
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:53.800
Don't wait.

802
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.200
Don't put it off.

803
00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.800
You can come forward to the front here at the end of the worship service. They'll

804
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.200
be pastors counselors eager to

805
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.200
care for you to listen to you to pray with you.

806
00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.500
You can be in harmony with God today.

807
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.600
You can be deeply embedded deeply

808
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.500
melded as one to the living Rock of

809
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.500
Jesus Christ. Who is our Majestic

810
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.600
King and our almighty

811
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.400
God.
