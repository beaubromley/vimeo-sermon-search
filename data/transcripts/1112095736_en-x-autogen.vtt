WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.545 --> 00:00:01.285
Thanks for coming.

2
00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:07.485
Hello? Anybody out there? You can talk back? No. Okay.

3
00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:10.045
Uh, I'm glad you guys are all here. Thanks for coming.

4
00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:11.725
Uh, I don't know that.

5
00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:14.765
Do we have enough copies for everybody?

6
00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:16.165
Did everybody get a copy? Or at least

7
00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:18.285
to all the couples at least get a copy?

8
00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:22.325
Um, I'm gonna start with the mic just

9
00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:23.885
to save my voice a little bit.

10
00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:25.845
If I can go without, that's fine too.

11
00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:28.765
But, um, anyway, glad you guys are here.

12
00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.565
So the only, my only problem is

13
00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.165
that I gave away all the copies.

14
00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:35.845
Did I have one of, uh,

15
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.605
I need the, uh, the al outline, the syllabus.

16
00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.445
I don't have this. Oh yeah. Could I have one, one of those?

17
00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:45.565
Anybody need the notes? Notes, Mr.

18
00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:50.325
Bar extra note, borrow that. I'll give it back.

19
00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:55.405
Alright, so welcome to Systematic Theology one.

20
00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.525
It's number one, because that's

21
00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:58.765
what we're doing this semester

22
00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:02.925
and the systematic theology two will be next semester.

23
00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:05.005
And so we'll talk about that a little bit.

24
00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.805
But let's do this. Um,

25
00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:09.845
before we start, let me pray for us and we'll die down.

26
00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:14.045
Almighty God, we thank you for tonight.

27
00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:17.165
And Lord, we thank you for the chance to be able

28
00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:20.125
to gather together as your people in this place,

29
00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:23.845
to study your word indeed, to, to think

30
00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:28.125
the most incredible thoughts that could pass

31
00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:30.765
through the mind of people, which is thoughts about God.

32
00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:34.045
And we thank you that you have revealed yourself.

33
00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:36.045
You have spoken through your word,

34
00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:38.645
you've entered into this world through the coming,

35
00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:41.205
first coming, and the incarnation of the Lord Jesus.

36
00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:45.845
And we thank you that you want to be known by us

37
00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:48.245
and uh, and that we have your word.

38
00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:49.925
That is a faithful, reliable guy.

39
00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:53.645
And I pray, Lord, as we just introduce the topic tonight,

40
00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:55.365
as we proceed in the months ahead,

41
00:01:55.675 --> 00:01:57.165
they indeed you would speak to us,

42
00:01:57.195 --> 00:01:58.805
that you would open our eyes

43
00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:00.685
to behold wonderful things in your word,

44
00:02:00.835 --> 00:02:02.205
Lord, even more than that.

45
00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:05.565
That we would see you in all of your glory and power

46
00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:07.845
and majesty, and that we would love you more,

47
00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:10.045
that we would worship you in truth,

48
00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:12.365
and that we would rightly represent you

49
00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:13.845
to the world around us.

50
00:02:13.945 --> 00:02:14.965
So Father, we thank you

51
00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:17.705
and uh, we give you our time tonight.

52
00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:19.425
In Jesus name. Amen.

53
00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:24.865
Alright, so, uh, if you've got a copy of the syllabus

54
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:28.905
or the outline for systematic theology one, I just wanted

55
00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:31.225
to walk through that quickly.

56
00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:34.865
Um, just a little housekeeping also as we go along,

57
00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:38.945
if you can please sign up, uh, either when you come in

58
00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:41.785
or on your way out, give us your

59
00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:43.465
number, email, whatever it is.

60
00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:45.345
Uh, if you don't have a copy,

61
00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:46.985
I don't know if we ran out totally.

62
00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:50.185
But if you don't have a copy of the outline

63
00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:52.225
or the syllabus, if you would please

64
00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:53.625
make sure we have your email.

65
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:57.225
And then I'll send out a copy of the notes with probably

66
00:02:57.225 --> 00:03:00.405
with filled in answers in case you miss any of it, as well

67
00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:01.925
as, um, the syllabus

68
00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:03.765
and the outline in case you need that as well.

69
00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:06.205
And if you have any other questions, uh,

70
00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:07.485
you can contact David.

71
00:03:08.185 --> 00:03:09.405
No, I'm just kidding you contact me.

72
00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:12.045
But David's helping me out with all the logistics.

73
00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:15.365
So thank you, David. We got us here thus far.

74
00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:20.125
Um, okay, so, uh,

75
00:03:20.185 --> 00:03:21.765
on the syllabus outline,

76
00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:24.085
I just wanna go over this quickly just to kind

77
00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:25.405
of highlight what we're doing.

78
00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:28.205
Part of what we're doing tonight is just introducing the

79
00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:29.205
topic and the subject

80
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:32.005
and, uh, the nature of the class as we walk through.

81
00:03:32.665 --> 00:03:36.765
And so, uh, so just to begin with,

82
00:03:37.475 --> 00:03:40.205
come on in this course.

83
00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:43.005
As you may already know, uh, it's the first of a series,

84
00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:45.605
well, I already said this, of two classes on this subject.

85
00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:47.725
Systematic theology just,

86
00:03:47.905 --> 00:03:51.325
or follows an organized approach to, uh, considering all

87
00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:52.525
that God has said in his Word.

88
00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:56.405
So you can read through this, the details of, um,

89
00:03:56.865 --> 00:03:58.085
the course objectives.

90
00:03:58.545 --> 00:04:00.085
We want. We want to deepen our faith.

91
00:04:00.145 --> 00:04:04.045
We wanna cultivate a more consistent, coherent,

92
00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:05.885
biblical worldview.

93
00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:08.605
Uh, we also want to value the word

94
00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:10.285
of God as the basis for all.

95
00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:13.045
We believe we wanna, uh, implement the truth

96
00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:14.525
of God's word into our lives.

97
00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:17.765
And so it's a matter of knowing and being and doing.

98
00:04:18.265 --> 00:04:20.165
And these are all things that we want to emphasize.

99
00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:22.485
And, uh, and if you don't know already,

100
00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:24.765
so I'm teaching tonight, I'm scheduled

101
00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:25.765
to teach the last class,

102
00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:28.845
and then also we've got a number of the elders who are here

103
00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:32.205
and some who aren't, who are gonna be teaching some

104
00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:33.925
of the individual classes as we go along.

105
00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:35.525
So we're glad you guys are here,

106
00:04:35.545 --> 00:04:38.125
and thanks for teaching the word to us as well.

107
00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:41.605
And so, um, anyway, look forward to that as we go along.

108
00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:47.425
The course textbook is, uh, this book right here,

109
00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:51.505
you made some of you, I know we're familiar with this book,

110
00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:54.345
Wayne Gru's, systematic Theology.

111
00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:56.705
Anybody here got this or read this one?

112
00:04:56.965 --> 00:05:00.705
Is this holding down paper on anybody's desk? Yeah.

113
00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:01.745
So this is great.

114
00:05:01.745 --> 00:05:04.065
This is a great resource, uh,

115
00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:08.425
and I want to recommend you get a copy, have it refer, uh,

116
00:05:08.435 --> 00:05:10.545
refer to it, uh, often,

117
00:05:11.205 --> 00:05:14.065
but that's not the one we're primarily using tonight.

118
00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:16.745
In this class, we're using the, he's got three of these,

119
00:05:17.245 --> 00:05:18.505
and they're pretty much all the same.

120
00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:21.225
The other one, you may have seen this basic Christian Doc,

121
00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:23.105
Christian Beliefs, and uh,

122
00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:25.225
it's the short version, cliff Notes.

123
00:05:25.255 --> 00:05:26.745
This one's the mid range copy.

124
00:05:27.135 --> 00:05:29.185
What we're planning to do in this class is do half

125
00:05:29.185 --> 00:05:30.585
of this this semester

126
00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:33.345
and then the back half of it next semester.

127
00:05:33.725 --> 00:05:35.225
And so this is the class textbook.

128
00:05:35.345 --> 00:05:39.415
I think I've got like 10 of them. What, how many do we got?

129
00:05:39.515 --> 00:05:41.775
10, 20. How many do we get? I can't remember.

130
00:05:42.195 --> 00:05:45.695
Um, I think it's 10. So anyway, they are

131
00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:47.375
for sale through the church.

132
00:05:47.475 --> 00:05:49.575
If you need one, I think they're $22.

133
00:05:50.075 --> 00:05:52.095
If not, you can get an Amazon Christian book.

134
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:56.335
You can do Audible, you can do Kindle, you can probably, uh,

135
00:05:56.475 --> 00:05:57.885
borrow one, right?

136
00:05:58.005 --> 00:06:00.605
I mean, they're, they're out there. So anyhow, uh,

137
00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:02.845
this second edition, and, uh, both

138
00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:04.085
of these in fact are second edition.

139
00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:06.245
And so if you got the old one, that works too.

140
00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.525
But the page numbers are off.

141
00:06:08.025 --> 00:06:10.165
And so, just so you know, anyway,

142
00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:12.165
there's a, a list of books here.

143
00:06:12.265 --> 00:06:14.165
I'm on page three. Uh, so

144
00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.165
that's our required read if you wanna, I mean,

145
00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:17.725
so you can attend this class

146
00:06:18.385 --> 00:06:21.005
and not do any of the reading, uh, if, well,

147
00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:23.325
so there's two things going on here, which you may know.

148
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.365
So you can just come, you can just come and, uh,

149
00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:29.085
and you can attend the class as often as you're able.

150
00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:30.845
You can follow along with the reading,

151
00:06:31.145 --> 00:06:32.325
you can read the short book

152
00:06:32.345 --> 00:06:33.725
or the mid book or the long book.

153
00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:36.205
Uh, you can do whatever. You can knock yourself out.

154
00:06:36.905 --> 00:06:40.365
Um, there's also going on a class

155
00:06:41.075 --> 00:06:44.365
that is seminary students taking this for credit.

156
00:06:44.545 --> 00:06:47.445
And so they have, they, it's not optional, right, for them.

157
00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:50.565
So they've got to do the reading, they've got writing, uh,

158
00:06:51.185 --> 00:06:52.885
all kinds of assignments that they have to do,

159
00:06:52.885 --> 00:06:53.685
and they're gonna do all the

160
00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:55.165
sweat, blood, and tears on that.

161
00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:57.565
And so I think currently we have nine

162
00:06:58.075 --> 00:07:00.805
that are seminary students enrolled for that.

163
00:07:00.805 --> 00:07:03.605
That's through Midwestern Seminaries Spur College.

164
00:07:04.265 --> 00:07:05.885
And, um, anyway, so if

165
00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:07.045
that's something you're interested in,

166
00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:08.205
you hadn't heard about that

167
00:07:08.225 --> 00:07:09.365
and you don't know about that yet,

168
00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:11.565
and you'd like to learn about that

169
00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:13.965
or even do that, then, uh, please let me know.

170
00:07:13.985 --> 00:07:17.565
You can earn up to like 33% of a master's degree that way.

171
00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:19.765
And, uh, for free, other than just buying

172
00:07:19.765 --> 00:07:20.805
the books and reading it.

173
00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:23.645
So anyway, uh, there's a different syllabus for that.

174
00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:26.245
If you're in that class, I was, if you're able, I'd like

175
00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.565
to huddle after we're done

176
00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:30.325
and just talk about that for, you know, a few minutes.

177
00:07:30.745 --> 00:07:31.965
And I've got your syllabus

178
00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:35.245
that we can go over if you've got questions on that.

179
00:07:35.265 --> 00:07:39.245
But anyway, um, so there's a, I I've listed a bunch

180
00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:41.925
of books in, uh, they're recommended for further study,

181
00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:43.765
but, uh, if you're in the class,

182
00:07:43.855 --> 00:07:46.005
these are required readings, at least one of them.

183
00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:48.805
Uh, but I want to, we'll highlight them as we go along.

184
00:07:48.805 --> 00:07:51.685
One's called the Lighting and the Trinity is a book review

185
00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:54.245
that, uh, the students in that class will be doing.

186
00:07:54.245 --> 00:07:56.965
And then also, uh, this one, finding the Right Hills

187
00:07:57.025 --> 00:08:01.205
to Die on by Gavin Orland is another one for review.

188
00:08:01.205 --> 00:08:02.725
And so I just wanna recommend, there's a lot

189
00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:04.845
of different resources we could talk about.

190
00:08:05.425 --> 00:08:07.565
And I even debated, you know, which books to use.

191
00:08:07.585 --> 00:08:09.765
And so anyway, there's a, there are a lot

192
00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:11.045
of good guides out there, but this is

193
00:08:11.045 --> 00:08:13.365
what we're doing for this semester.

194
00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:17.205
So, um, if you wanna look at the, uh, page four,

195
00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:18.685
this is the schedule.

196
00:08:19.195 --> 00:08:20.325
I've tried to just map it out.

197
00:08:20.325 --> 00:08:21.565
This pretty much as follows

198
00:08:21.565 --> 00:08:24.125
and maps over, uh, all the other classes

199
00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:25.805
that are going on on Wednesday nights.

200
00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:29.285
And so whenever all the classes are meeting this class would

201
00:08:29.315 --> 00:08:32.925
will be meeting, um, if you're in the four credit class,

202
00:08:32.975 --> 00:08:34.405
we've got a couple of additional things,

203
00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:35.965
um, outside of that.

204
00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:38.445
Otherwise, we are, everything is tied to

205
00:08:38.445 --> 00:08:39.965
what everybody else is doing on Wednesday nights.

206
00:08:40.505 --> 00:08:43.445
So that is what I have for us in that regard.

207
00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:47.685
Uh, is there, do you have any questions about that outline

208
00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:49.685
and syllabus at this point?

209
00:08:49.945 --> 00:08:53.165
Any questions about that? Okay.

210
00:08:53.945 --> 00:08:55.045
Either I did good

211
00:08:55.225 --> 00:08:57.165
or, um, that was, you're totally lost,

212
00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:00.525
so I'm gonna believe I did good and we'll move on.

213
00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:07.125
Okay. Uh, so if you're interested in a

214
00:09:07.405 --> 00:09:09.365
textbook, I've got, I think it is eight

215
00:09:09.385 --> 00:09:11.205
or 10 of them left, I believe it is.

216
00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:13.045
Uh, just grab me afterwards.

217
00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:17.685
I know one's already spoken for, uh, paid for, and, uh,

218
00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:20.925
and so anyway, uh, otherwise you can have the other ones.

219
00:09:21.665 --> 00:09:24.965
Um, gosh, I meant to do this here.

220
00:09:24.985 --> 00:09:26.005
Here's something I'm gonna do.

221
00:09:26.155 --> 00:09:31.125
This is, uh, you

222
00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:32.445
guys will help me pass this out.

223
00:09:32.445 --> 00:09:34.165
Yeah. You know what?

224
00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:36.965
I, one you don't remember, I do,

225
00:09:37.025 --> 00:09:39.205
but you know, I'm, I'll hand it out in a minute.

226
00:09:39.825 --> 00:09:44.725
Secret things. So, uh, what we're gonna do is pass those.

227
00:09:45.265 --> 00:09:47.325
I'm, I'm sort of thinking through, like each night

228
00:09:47.935 --> 00:09:51.565
we'll have, you could consider it a memory verse, like one

229
00:09:51.565 --> 00:09:55.005
that you memorized, uh, meditate on, you try to commit it

230
00:09:55.005 --> 00:09:57.565
to memory, but you talk about why that's valuable, if

231
00:09:57.565 --> 00:09:58.605
that's something you've never done.

232
00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:01.165
But the main thing I wanna do

233
00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:03.805
with it is it's at least a kind of a key verse.

234
00:10:04.435 --> 00:10:07.165
Like, it's a key verse that will sort of be thinking

235
00:10:07.165 --> 00:10:10.765
through, or it's at least tied to the theme of

236
00:10:10.765 --> 00:10:11.965
what we'll do for the evening.

237
00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:16.885
And so anyway, um, if you've never seen something like this

238
00:10:16.885 --> 00:10:18.285
before, I dunno if you've been in these classes,

239
00:10:18.935 --> 00:10:20.965
we've done this on the front.

240
00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:23.325
I've just got the verse written out on the back.

241
00:10:23.675 --> 00:10:27.885
It's got the first letter of each word in that verse,

242
00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:30.645
and it's just a tool to where as you get familiar

243
00:10:30.645 --> 00:10:31.925
with the verse, you just repeat it.

244
00:10:32.225 --> 00:10:34.205
And it's kind of a cheat sheet in that regard.

245
00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:35.765
It's just a great aid to memory.

246
00:10:36.065 --> 00:10:39.485
And so the main point is to, uh, if you wanna take it home,

247
00:10:39.485 --> 00:10:41.725
stick it in your Bible, you know, put it on a,

248
00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.605
on your refrigerator, whatever it is,

249
00:10:43.865 --> 00:10:45.205
and, and think about it.

250
00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:46.685
That's the whole point. Think about it.

251
00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:48.245
We meditate on God's word.

252
00:10:48.275 --> 00:10:51.085
It's a little like the way a cow chews the C, right?

253
00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:52.245
Like, we wanna read it.

254
00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:54.005
Sometimes we'll read it and we say, man, I'm there.

255
00:10:54.005 --> 00:10:56.245
I've already read it. We really actually think about it,

256
00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:59.005
and we stew over it, and we think about what it means.

257
00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:01.845
We think about the words, and we let it seep into our minds

258
00:11:01.845 --> 00:11:03.245
and our hearts and changes.

259
00:11:03.585 --> 00:11:07.205
And so, uh, anyway, so I wanted to give that out.

260
00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:11.285
We will, um, be talking about this verse, uh, we'll refer

261
00:11:11.305 --> 00:11:13.605
to it a number of times tonight,

262
00:11:14.425 --> 00:11:17.645
but let me begin by, uh, just reading it,

263
00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:20.485
and then that'll be sent kind of the theme

264
00:11:20.505 --> 00:11:21.925
for our, our evening.

265
00:11:22.665 --> 00:11:26.085
So it comes from Deuteronomy 29, 29.

266
00:11:26.315 --> 00:11:28.165
It's the beginning of that verse.

267
00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:29.405
There's a little more to it,

268
00:11:29.425 --> 00:11:31.365
but to save room, I just stopped there.

269
00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:35.645
Um, and so Deuteronomy 29 29 says

270
00:11:35.645 --> 00:11:39.565
that the secret things belong to the Lord our God,

271
00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:44.445
but the things that are revealed belong to us

272
00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:47.605
and to our children forever.

273
00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:51.645
Now, this is an awesome passage of scripture.

274
00:11:51.785 --> 00:11:54.365
In fact, if you've never, never memorized much,

275
00:11:54.485 --> 00:11:57.685
I would recommend that you start here, uh, in the middle

276
00:11:57.705 --> 00:12:00.285
of the Book of Moses, a book

277
00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:02.765
that sometimes I think we feel like could be obscure.

278
00:12:02.935 --> 00:12:05.125
Seems like a long time ago, uh, you know,

279
00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:08.325
when King David wrote in Psalm on 19 said, oh,

280
00:12:08.345 --> 00:12:10.085
how I love your law.

281
00:12:10.265 --> 00:12:11.805
It is my meditation all day long.

282
00:12:12.225 --> 00:12:14.525
He was literally thinking probably about the first five

283
00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:18.915
books of the Bible, because God's law, the Torah was, uh,

284
00:12:18.935 --> 00:12:21.715
the books of Moses, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,

285
00:12:21.715 --> 00:12:23.955
Deuteronomy numbers, and, uh, anyway.

286
00:12:23.955 --> 00:12:27.275
And so the secret things, so

287
00:12:27.865 --> 00:12:29.155
what we're talking about here is there are

288
00:12:29.175 --> 00:12:30.675
secret things, right?

289
00:12:31.345 --> 00:12:33.675
Like he probably questions about God.

290
00:12:34.255 --> 00:12:35.875
He probably thought about God

291
00:12:35.895 --> 00:12:37.395
and even wondered at times, like,

292
00:12:37.585 --> 00:12:38.675
like, I don't know about that.

293
00:12:38.935 --> 00:12:40.875
You know? I mean, I don't know about you guys,

294
00:12:41.015 --> 00:12:42.475
but I know the elders have, right?

295
00:12:43.135 --> 00:12:48.075
You guys do that sometimes. Okay? Yeah. I, me too, right?

296
00:12:48.345 --> 00:12:50.355
Even still, you know, I've been Christian, I've been,

297
00:12:50.355 --> 00:12:51.355
I've been a Christian now for

298
00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:53.555
like, I don't know how old am I?

299
00:12:53.895 --> 00:12:57.915
Um, 25 plus years, I think,

300
00:12:58.255 --> 00:12:59.355
uh, no, it's more than that.

301
00:12:59.355 --> 00:13:00.955
Close to 30. And uh,

302
00:13:01.455 --> 00:13:03.995
and I've found a lot of great answers over the time

303
00:13:04.495 --> 00:13:06.755
and God's word and things that really help

304
00:13:06.815 --> 00:13:09.195
and change my life and change my thinking.

305
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:12.195
But the truth is, I still have have thoughts about God.

306
00:13:12.275 --> 00:13:13.755
I wonder about this, and I wonder about that.

307
00:13:14.015 --> 00:13:17.395
And that's sort of why we wanna study a topic like this.

308
00:13:18.155 --> 00:13:19.835
'cause what we realize, some of those things are secret

309
00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:23.355
unless or until God makes them known.

310
00:13:23.775 --> 00:13:28.235
That's the whole point of the word revelation in the sense

311
00:13:28.235 --> 00:13:31.875
of like, God's not the book of Revelation, but e exactly.

312
00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:34.435
But the sense of God revealing himself,

313
00:13:34.455 --> 00:13:35.675
things we don't know about God

314
00:13:35.675 --> 00:13:37.155
unless he makes it known to us.

315
00:13:37.655 --> 00:13:39.915
And so anyway, there's secret things. They belong to God.

316
00:13:39.915 --> 00:13:41.395
There's some things God will never tell us.

317
00:13:41.395 --> 00:13:43.395
Some things we'll never fully understand.

318
00:13:43.575 --> 00:13:46.475
But there are things that God has made known,

319
00:13:47.175 --> 00:13:49.155
and these are the second part of this is that,

320
00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:52.995
but the things that are revealed, the things

321
00:13:52.995 --> 00:13:56.555
that God has made known to us, those

322
00:13:57.655 --> 00:13:58.755
really matter to us.

323
00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.235
What's it say there? They belong to us

324
00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:04.715
and they belong to our children forever.

325
00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:07.915
And so when I read a verse like that, I think, man,

326
00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:09.155
there's awesome things about God

327
00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:10.755
that I wouldn't otherwise know.

328
00:14:11.215 --> 00:14:13.995
But he has made it known really clear and plain,

329
00:14:14.055 --> 00:14:17.315
and he really wants us to know and understand those things.

330
00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:20.515
And he wants us to so live in light of them,

331
00:14:20.515 --> 00:14:23.195
that it changes us, and that we pass it on to our children

332
00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:25.035
and to our children's children,

333
00:14:25.575 --> 00:14:27.435
and from generation to the next

334
00:14:28.005 --> 00:14:30.635
cross cultures across the whole face of this planet,

335
00:14:31.225 --> 00:14:33.475
that the knowledge of God will be made known,

336
00:14:33.655 --> 00:14:35.755
the things he's made known He wants us to know

337
00:14:35.755 --> 00:14:37.275
and everybody else to know.

338
00:14:37.815 --> 00:14:40.075
And so we need to explore them and pursue them.

339
00:14:40.455 --> 00:14:42.635
That's why this is the theme verse.

340
00:14:42.855 --> 00:14:45.555
Who do I steal this from? You can have it back.

341
00:14:46.105 --> 00:14:48.515
Anybody you want one need it.

342
00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:51.035
It's right up here, uh, on your way out.

343
00:14:52.865 --> 00:14:55.965
So, uh, okay. Amen. Amen.

344
00:14:55.965 --> 00:14:58.725
Alright, you can talk back to me as we go along.

345
00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:02.965
Uh, just stop me about some things, okay?

346
00:15:03.145 --> 00:15:04.805
Uh, so according to your notes,

347
00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:06.085
if you wanna just start following along,

348
00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:07.645
there's a lot to do here.

349
00:15:07.905 --> 00:15:10.965
And my phone's right there, so, uh, I don't have a clock.

350
00:15:11.025 --> 00:15:12.485
So David, if you'll be my clock,

351
00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:14.725
I know we're talking about the m uh,

352
00:15:14.745 --> 00:15:16.645
but if I'm running late, just lemme know.

353
00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.245
Uh, what is theology?

354
00:15:21.655 --> 00:15:23.025
What does that word, everybody here

355
00:15:23.025 --> 00:15:24.145
heard that word for theology.

356
00:15:25.805 --> 00:15:27.185
So we want to know what it means.

357
00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:29.545
Where does that actually come from? Anybody know?

358
00:15:29.575 --> 00:15:34.065
It's kind of a weird word. Theology. Theology.

359
00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:36.105
So it's actually a combination of two

360
00:15:37.115 --> 00:15:41.865
Greek words should have tried this.

361
00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:45.545
First Theos

362
00:15:47.805 --> 00:15:50.425
and Lagos,

363
00:15:52.845 --> 00:15:56.265
God and word.

364
00:15:58.565 --> 00:16:02.305
So these are two Greek words

365
00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:04.025
they ask means God.

366
00:16:04.515 --> 00:16:05.665
Lagos means word.

367
00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:08.665
So we're, we're talking about God,

368
00:16:08.665 --> 00:16:11.185
these are words about God.

369
00:16:11.885 --> 00:16:13.185
And so informally, you might

370
00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:14.305
just say, there's just God talk.

371
00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:15.825
We're just talking about God. Like

372
00:16:15.825 --> 00:16:16.905
what God, what's God like?

373
00:16:17.805 --> 00:16:20.265
Uh, what are his, what's his nature?

374
00:16:20.265 --> 00:16:22.465
What's his characteristics? What does he do?

375
00:16:23.285 --> 00:16:26.145
Uh, maybe you hear this phrase sometimes out in the

376
00:16:26.145 --> 00:16:27.185
world, maybe you've said it.

377
00:16:27.645 --> 00:16:30.785
Say, well, my God would never do something like this.

378
00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:36.325
Well, or somebody says, Hey, there is no God in some regard,

379
00:16:36.505 --> 00:16:39.005
all of that is theological language.

380
00:16:39.005 --> 00:16:43.845
It's common about it's words about God.

381
00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:45.405
So, um, that's sort

382
00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:47.485
of informally speaking in my sense that way.

383
00:16:47.865 --> 00:16:49.125
Now, if you press that too far,

384
00:16:49.145 --> 00:16:50.965
and someone says, well, my God would never do this.

385
00:16:51.035 --> 00:16:53.445
Like, and it's clear in the Bible, he might

386
00:16:54.475 --> 00:16:57.045
then we're guilty of something called idolatry,

387
00:16:57.135 --> 00:16:59.285
which means we're making a God on our own image.

388
00:16:59.425 --> 00:17:02.885
So we have thoughts about God, we have God's word,

389
00:17:03.225 --> 00:17:04.525
we have other people's opinions,

390
00:17:04.905 --> 00:17:07.885
but we still have, um, we're talking about God.

391
00:17:07.905 --> 00:17:11.125
So informally, theology is just talking about God,

392
00:17:11.125 --> 00:17:13.805
technically speaking kind of as a technical phrase.

393
00:17:14.225 --> 00:17:16.925
It means, uh, the study of God.

394
00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:19.325
So we're studying about God,

395
00:17:19.325 --> 00:17:21.845
and even more formally than that, as we'll see in a minute.

396
00:17:22.265 --> 00:17:26.325
Um, there's a specific category of theology broadly

397
00:17:26.835 --> 00:17:29.125
that is called the doctrine of God.

398
00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:31.525
Like where we're just talking about the nature

399
00:17:31.525 --> 00:17:33.125
of not just everything God's revealed,

400
00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:34.605
but the nature of God himself.

401
00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:38.325
We call that specifically, we'll call it theology proper.

402
00:17:38.545 --> 00:17:39.765
But anyway, um,

403
00:17:40.105 --> 00:17:42.125
so there's theology which we're talking about, God.

404
00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:45.645
So the the idea of systematic theology is

405
00:17:45.645 --> 00:17:47.725
that there is a systematic approach.

406
00:17:47.955 --> 00:17:51.285
It's not random or arbitrary.

407
00:17:51.595 --> 00:17:54.125
It's not accidental or incidental.

408
00:17:54.155 --> 00:17:55.885
Like, like I think theologically,

409
00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:57.725
whenever I think, oh, I just wonder about this thing

410
00:17:57.895 --> 00:17:59.245
where I have a problem in my life

411
00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:02.005
where I encounter a question, I'm thinking about God,

412
00:18:02.105 --> 00:18:03.365
I'm kind of doing theology about that.

413
00:18:04.385 --> 00:18:08.605
But systematic theology is designed to be intentional

414
00:18:09.145 --> 00:18:11.645
and focused and not just sort of scattered and random.

415
00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:13.805
Um, and, and the thing that,

416
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:16.725
that thinking systematically about theology, part

417
00:18:16.725 --> 00:18:19.085
of what's important about that is it makes sure

418
00:18:19.085 --> 00:18:22.845
that we are able to sort of properly consider all

419
00:18:22.865 --> 00:18:26.845
of the significant things that've got has revealed to us.

420
00:18:27.385 --> 00:18:29.565
And so it's important that we think, uh,

421
00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:31.845
systematically through that.

422
00:18:31.845 --> 00:18:34.565
And that's what we try to do in, uh, systematic theology.

423
00:18:34.705 --> 00:18:36.525
So obviously, like in this class,

424
00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:38.925
and we're talking about, we're talking about Christian

425
00:18:39.245 --> 00:18:40.285
theology, of course,

426
00:18:40.305 --> 00:18:43.525
you can talk about theology from a Islamic standpoint

427
00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:46.565
or from an atheist standpoint or a Buddhist standpoint.

428
00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:47.885
And we're not doing any,

429
00:18:47.885 --> 00:18:48.925
we're not talking about any of that.

430
00:18:48.925 --> 00:18:50.085
We're talking about Christian theology,

431
00:18:50.085 --> 00:18:52.405
meaning we're grounding it in the word of God.

432
00:18:52.415 --> 00:18:54.965
We're talking about what God has made clear in

433
00:18:54.985 --> 00:18:56.085
his word in the Bible.

434
00:18:56.785 --> 00:19:00.525
And, uh, so in the textbook, Wayne Grum, the author,

435
00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:04.645
he defines Theo Sy, he defines systematic theology this way.

436
00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:08.325
It is any study that answers the question,

437
00:19:09.395 --> 00:19:11.805
what does the whole Bible teach us today

438
00:19:11.805 --> 00:19:12.845
about any given topic?

439
00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:16.045
And obviously, as you probably know, if you're familiar

440
00:19:16.045 --> 00:19:18.605
with the Bible, it doesn't address everything.

441
00:19:19.265 --> 00:19:23.155
Like, for example, as I understand, I don't believe

442
00:19:23.155 --> 00:19:25.195
that there are cats in the Bible,

443
00:19:26.055 --> 00:19:27.435
but it doesn't mean they don't exist.

444
00:19:28.215 --> 00:19:31.875
It doesn't mean that you may or may not like them, right?

445
00:19:32.155 --> 00:19:33.235
Whatever it might be. But,

446
00:19:33.895 --> 00:19:35.835
so God doesn't comment on everything,

447
00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:40.035
but everything that he has commented on, uh,

448
00:19:40.415 --> 00:19:43.755
it is authoritative and significant and,

449
00:19:43.895 --> 00:19:45.995
and important that we search that out.

450
00:19:47.775 --> 00:19:52.315
So, uh, so it's considering all that the Bible says,

451
00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:55.035
not just randomly, but all of the biblical data.

452
00:19:55.305 --> 00:19:57.435
What does it God say about these certain points?

453
00:19:58.055 --> 00:19:59.835
Um, and so the whole Bible's important.

454
00:19:59.905 --> 00:20:02.955
It's not just random. Um, and it's Christian

455
00:20:02.955 --> 00:20:04.195
because we're talking about the whole Bible.

456
00:20:04.495 --> 00:20:08.235
Uh, so as Christians, the whole Bible means

457
00:20:09.095 --> 00:20:12.315
the New Testament and the old, right?

458
00:20:12.905 --> 00:20:14.475
Okay, so we're Christians, meaning

459
00:20:15.095 --> 00:20:18.355
we believe the Old Testament as well as the new.

460
00:20:18.895 --> 00:20:21.875
And, um, so anyway, that's, uh, that's just an important

461
00:20:22.925 --> 00:20:24.395
point that we want to keep in mind

462
00:20:24.395 --> 00:20:25.675
that God has revealed himself

463
00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:27.235
through all the pages of the, of the Bible.

464
00:20:28.105 --> 00:20:31.765
So as we study systematic theology, there's a, uh,

465
00:20:31.765 --> 00:20:33.965
another word that comes up the word doctrine.

466
00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:37.565
Um, and this is, the book is named Bible doctrine.

467
00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:40.645
And so what is a doctrine in general?

468
00:20:41.285 --> 00:20:42.885
A doctrine is just teaching

469
00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:46.245
and instruction is just simply what that means.

470
00:20:47.065 --> 00:20:49.685
Uh, but a specific doctrine is,

471
00:20:49.685 --> 00:20:52.405
you might say it's the result of systematic theology.

472
00:20:53.035 --> 00:20:54.725
It's the result of considering all

473
00:20:54.725 --> 00:20:58.205
that the Bible says about a particular thing you would say.

474
00:20:58.475 --> 00:21:01.565
That thing, when we've distilled down into, we've kinda

475
00:21:02.165 --> 00:21:04.485
considered everything God has said about a subject

476
00:21:04.675 --> 00:21:07.325
that we would say, well, that is a doctrine.

477
00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:09.085
That's what the whole Bible teaches about

478
00:21:09.085 --> 00:21:10.205
that certain thing.

479
00:21:10.265 --> 00:21:12.205
So what, what the Bible teaches about the nature

480
00:21:12.225 --> 00:21:15.445
of God in the sense that he's a trinity, uh,

481
00:21:15.745 --> 00:21:17.805
or about the incarnation of the Lord Jesus

482
00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:20.005
or the deity of Christ, for example.

483
00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:24.045
Uh, these, actually, these aren't words the Bible uses.

484
00:21:24.045 --> 00:21:25.925
Trinity is not in the Bible.

485
00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:28.925
Uh, they weren't, incarnation was not in the Bible.

486
00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:31.645
Um, and,

487
00:21:31.785 --> 00:21:33.325
and the deity of Christ,

488
00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.925
at least in the way that we say that.

489
00:21:35.225 --> 00:21:38.525
And so, but these are words that help us to capture

490
00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:42.805
a large amount of content in the Bible

491
00:21:43.145 --> 00:21:45.885
and distill them into words that we can use to communicate

492
00:21:46.385 --> 00:21:48.405
and, uh, and to categorize those things with.

493
00:21:48.465 --> 00:21:50.365
So, so that would be a doctrine.

494
00:21:51.145 --> 00:21:53.045
And, and in this class, and there's major

495
00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.965
and minor doctrines, uh, in this class,

496
00:21:54.965 --> 00:21:56.405
predominantly, I've got a list here.

497
00:21:56.665 --> 00:21:58.685
Uh, the doctrines will go through the board of God,

498
00:21:59.065 --> 00:22:03.525
the nature of God, uh, the doctrine of man, uh, the doctrine

499
00:22:03.525 --> 00:22:06.525
of sin, of Christ, of the Holy Spirit, salvation

500
00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:07.605
of the church, the future.

501
00:22:08.185 --> 00:22:10.165
Uh, you can use the big theological terms,

502
00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:12.645
which I'd encourage you, frankly, to get familiar with.

503
00:22:12.645 --> 00:22:15.925
There's bology, theology, anthropology, pharmacology.

504
00:22:16.275 --> 00:22:19.285
There's christology, pneumatology, soteriology,

505
00:22:20.245 --> 00:22:21.645
ecclesiology and eschatology.

506
00:22:22.345 --> 00:22:25.365
And so all the ologies you could want, uh, if you hang

507
00:22:25.365 --> 00:22:26.805
around, that's what we're gonna be talking about.

508
00:22:27.505 --> 00:22:32.245
So, um, anyway, um, you know, Lord willing,

509
00:22:32.605 --> 00:22:36.085
I, I hope that in a class like this, that in some level

510
00:22:36.185 --> 00:22:38.325
and in some way, every single one of us

511
00:22:38.835 --> 00:22:41.165
will encounter some truth about God

512
00:22:41.165 --> 00:22:42.845
that maybe we haven't really thought about

513
00:22:43.505 --> 00:22:44.805
as often or as deeply.

514
00:22:45.425 --> 00:22:49.485
Uh, you might even find as you study the Bible like this,

515
00:22:49.515 --> 00:22:51.365
that it challenges some of the beliefs

516
00:22:51.755 --> 00:22:54.085
that you've already held or maybe that you were raised with.

517
00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:55.765
Uh, if you grew up in church,

518
00:22:55.865 --> 00:22:59.525
you might have a very specific tradition where some of

519
00:22:59.525 --> 00:23:01.445
that gets, you kind of think, Hmm, you know, is

520
00:23:01.445 --> 00:23:02.565
that quite the way it goes?

521
00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:04.565
Or If you didn't grow up in church, then

522
00:23:05.205 --> 00:23:06.605
I guarantee you're gonna have some of that.

523
00:23:07.065 --> 00:23:09.925
And, um, but we'll have that across the board, in fact.

524
00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:12.045
And I wanna encourage you that, uh, that's a good thing.

525
00:23:12.155 --> 00:23:14.925
Like, it's a good thing to reflect on what we believe

526
00:23:15.065 --> 00:23:18.805
and to assess what we believe in light of God's word.

527
00:23:19.345 --> 00:23:22.245
And to let God teach us through his words.

528
00:23:22.245 --> 00:23:25.325
Some of the way, often it gets referred to is that we want

529
00:23:25.325 --> 00:23:26.485
to thank God's thoughts

530
00:23:26.615 --> 00:23:29.565
after him, meaning God's word has been revealed

531
00:23:29.565 --> 00:23:31.645
to us in writing, so we can read it

532
00:23:31.945 --> 00:23:33.005
so that we can understand it.

533
00:23:33.025 --> 00:23:36.365
So we begin to think about the world and life

534
00:23:36.465 --> 00:23:39.125
and who he is in light of what he's already thought.

535
00:23:39.505 --> 00:23:40.725
And he's made that clear to us.

536
00:23:40.865 --> 00:23:44.245
So, so our our authority is God's word.

537
00:23:44.465 --> 00:23:47.285
And, um, not so much our tradition

538
00:23:47.985 --> 00:23:50.205
or, um, or any of that.

539
00:23:50.505 --> 00:23:53.125
So there, you know, we, you can talk about, there's other

540
00:23:53.735 --> 00:23:57.445
forms of, uh, theological study that you can pursue.

541
00:23:57.445 --> 00:23:58.805
There's historical theology.

542
00:23:58.955 --> 00:24:00.125
I've included this in the notes.

543
00:24:00.745 --> 00:24:03.525
Um, that's just kind of looking throughout history,

544
00:24:04.385 --> 00:24:07.765
how has the church thought about this particular thing?

545
00:24:08.265 --> 00:24:10.045
So you could go back like 1800 years.

546
00:24:10.345 --> 00:24:12.845
How did the church view the Lord's supper?

547
00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:15.885
And then, you know, 1,680,

548
00:24:16.465 --> 00:24:18.245
how did the church approach the Lord's supper?

549
00:24:18.245 --> 00:24:20.245
And then in 1905,

550
00:24:20.385 --> 00:24:23.005
how did the church consider the Lord's Supper?

551
00:24:23.005 --> 00:24:24.085
That's historical theology.

552
00:24:24.625 --> 00:24:26.405
Uh, and you can do that on all the different topics.

553
00:24:26.585 --> 00:24:29.205
And so it's a, it's a historical consideration.

554
00:24:29.675 --> 00:24:32.725
There's philosophical theology, which you really don't have

555
00:24:32.725 --> 00:24:34.885
to use the Bible too much, but people do those trying

556
00:24:34.885 --> 00:24:36.365
to use logic and reason.

557
00:24:36.435 --> 00:24:37.645
It's related to the next one.

558
00:24:37.645 --> 00:24:41.365
It can be, uh, which is apologetics, which is, uh,

559
00:24:41.365 --> 00:24:45.485
attempting to defend the Christian faith to unbelievers or,

560
00:24:45.785 --> 00:24:48.605
or to present Christian truth in a way that sort

561
00:24:48.605 --> 00:24:51.565
of argues reliably into an unbelieving world.

562
00:24:52.105 --> 00:24:55.285
And, um, so that's another one. There's ethics, ethics.

563
00:24:55.315 --> 00:24:58.485
It's concerned about questions of how we live now, as we'll.

564
00:24:58.485 --> 00:25:00.845
See, I mean, like, all of theology does

565
00:25:00.985 --> 00:25:03.965
and should have immediate application,

566
00:25:03.985 --> 00:25:06.045
at least at some point into our lives.

567
00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:09.405
But, but the whole realm of ethics has to do with, um,

568
00:25:10.465 --> 00:25:13.525
you know, how implications of, of the truth of God's word.

569
00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:15.885
So like, you might say, family or marriage or,

570
00:25:16.225 --> 00:25:18.525
or issues of like the end of life for abortion,

571
00:25:18.785 --> 00:25:21.045
racial reconciliation, or whatever it might be.

572
00:25:21.225 --> 00:25:23.565
And so the Bible speaks to ethical things,

573
00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:25.685
whether you're a Christian or not, right?

574
00:25:25.705 --> 00:25:28.525
It addresses that. And so that's the idea of ethics.

575
00:25:29.565 --> 00:25:31.985
Now, biblical theology is, uh, you know,

576
00:25:31.985 --> 00:25:34.505
obviously we want all of our theology to be biblical.

577
00:25:34.605 --> 00:25:37.505
I'm saying that what we're doing in this class is biblical,

578
00:25:38.005 --> 00:25:41.105
but as a category, biblical theology just means

579
00:25:41.495 --> 00:25:43.825
that rather than looking at the whole Bible,

580
00:25:43.845 --> 00:25:45.305
you're looking at a part of the Bible.

581
00:25:45.615 --> 00:25:46.985
What is it that Paul teaches?

582
00:25:47.575 --> 00:25:49.545
What is it that the book of Matthew teaches?

583
00:25:49.575 --> 00:25:52.545
What is it that this paragraph teaches? You know?

584
00:25:52.565 --> 00:25:55.545
And so it's thinking what you might call canonically

585
00:25:55.545 --> 00:25:56.865
and the whole canon of the Bible.

586
00:25:57.235 --> 00:26:00.025
Where are we and what exactly is sort of being communicated?

587
00:26:00.445 --> 00:26:02.665
And then, anyway, so that's, we could go on,

588
00:26:02.685 --> 00:26:06.345
but two subsets of that are Old Testament theology

589
00:26:06.345 --> 00:26:07.425
and New Testament theology.

590
00:26:07.685 --> 00:26:10.065
It just means that they're limited to the realm

591
00:26:10.065 --> 00:26:11.825
of the Old Testament or li

592
00:26:11.825 --> 00:26:13.985
or limited to the realm of the New Testament.

593
00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:16.665
So that's, uh, that's some of the other options

594
00:26:16.695 --> 00:26:18.585
that you can pursue in theology.

595
00:26:18.645 --> 00:26:20.225
So anyways, uh, just moving along,

596
00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:23.345
theology studies two primary aspects of God.

597
00:26:23.345 --> 00:26:24.625
We'll talk about a lot more than that,

598
00:26:25.005 --> 00:26:27.585
but fundamentally, um, there's two primary aspects.

599
00:26:27.725 --> 00:26:30.905
So, uh, lemme just get, let me, let's see here.

600
00:26:30.905 --> 00:26:34.625
Who wants to volunteer without knowing

601
00:26:34.625 --> 00:26:35.665
what you're sounding up for?

602
00:26:36.535 --> 00:26:40.265
Anybody, anybody brave? Any courageous souls out there?

603
00:26:41.605 --> 00:26:44.325
Tr everybody know tr I'll just volunteer.

604
00:26:44.325 --> 00:26:46.445
You don't have to get up. Hey, Julie, you don't have

605
00:26:46.445 --> 00:26:47.565
to do anything, honestly.

606
00:26:48.105 --> 00:26:49.925
Um, anybody?

607
00:26:50.105 --> 00:26:53.125
You, you, well, hang on, hang on a second.

608
00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:57.805
Uh, so, so tr somebody tell me about t

609
00:27:02.775 --> 00:27:07.525
Sorry, I, he has great fashion sense, clearly a skater

610
00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:08.925
with Yeah, absolutely.

611
00:27:09.075 --> 00:27:11.485
Wait, what'd you say?

612
00:27:12.205 --> 00:27:14.325
I said he's clearly a skater with a Santa Cruz skater.

613
00:27:14.485 --> 00:27:17.885
I know. Fashion sense. He's a skater. I don't know.

614
00:27:17.885 --> 00:27:19.045
Is that right? Are you a skater?

615
00:27:21.115 --> 00:27:25.965
Just looks like this does my passion since winning out over

616
00:27:27.275 --> 00:27:28.365
Yeah, I was say, but,

617
00:27:28.425 --> 00:27:30.245
but in all seriousness, like, um,

618
00:27:30.755 --> 00:27:32.605
what do we know about tr He's a doctor.

619
00:27:33.155 --> 00:27:37.365
Okay, he's a doctor. It's what you do. What else?

620
00:27:38.145 --> 00:27:40.845
What's that? He's got a missionary card. Okay. Yeah.

621
00:27:41.555 --> 00:27:44.525
What else? Dad? What?

622
00:27:44.905 --> 00:27:48.325
The dad, I'm sorry. He's a dad. Yeah. Okay.

623
00:27:48.335 --> 00:27:51.805
Who's related to, um, I wasn't gonna say he's tall,

624
00:27:51.805 --> 00:27:54.285
but everybody's tall to me, so I don't really know

625
00:27:55.045 --> 00:27:56.445
actually about that.

626
00:27:57.185 --> 00:28:00.965
Um, what else? One more. Church leader.

627
00:28:01.225 --> 00:28:05.485
Church leader, okay. All around Greg Gaff. Okay. Yeah.

628
00:28:05.545 --> 00:28:07.245
So, so what we're describing is things

629
00:28:07.275 --> 00:28:11.845
that are like ways he's like, uh, things you do things, uh,

630
00:28:11.845 --> 00:28:14.485
from the way you dress to what you do for work, um,

631
00:28:14.785 --> 00:28:16.125
people you're related to.

632
00:28:16.705 --> 00:28:18.605
So in the same way in theology,

633
00:28:18.605 --> 00:28:21.565
we're talking about the nature of God, we're talking about

634
00:28:22.115 --> 00:28:25.965
what he's like, who he's related to, uh, things he does,

635
00:28:26.185 --> 00:28:29.205
what's his occupation, um, what he has done.

636
00:28:29.905 --> 00:28:32.845
And so these are all things that we talk about in theology.

637
00:28:32.985 --> 00:28:36.085
So the two main, if you're using the notes, the points are,

638
00:28:36.425 --> 00:28:40.005
uh, we talk about God's being kind of just who he is.

639
00:28:41.145 --> 00:28:42.845
And we talk about his acting.

640
00:28:43.905 --> 00:28:48.165
So who God is and what he does or what he has done

641
00:28:48.865 --> 00:28:50.885
or what he is going to do.

642
00:28:51.655 --> 00:28:55.045
These are all the things that we consider about God.

643
00:28:56.985 --> 00:29:01.445
So, um, three aspects to theology that we'll study here.

644
00:29:01.785 --> 00:29:05.445
Uh, number one, um, I've already said this.

645
00:29:05.445 --> 00:29:06.885
We're talking about Christian theology.

646
00:29:06.885 --> 00:29:09.605
It's Christian, not non-Christian theology.

647
00:29:10.105 --> 00:29:14.895
Um, our focus is Protestant rather than Roman Catholic

648
00:29:14.915 --> 00:29:16.055
or Eastern Orthodox

649
00:29:16.235 --> 00:29:19.415
or some other kind of branch of, uh, Christian

650
00:29:19.635 --> 00:29:21.575
of Christianity, of which there are many.

651
00:29:22.195 --> 00:29:25.895
Um, and so just quickly kind of what that means.

652
00:29:25.915 --> 00:29:27.375
We could talk a lot about this. I don't want

653
00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:30.335
to spend too much time 'cause I don't think we're real.

654
00:29:30.695 --> 00:29:33.335
I think we're all on a similar page to some extent.

655
00:29:33.875 --> 00:29:37.495
Um, but in the Protestant reformation, um,

656
00:29:37.875 --> 00:29:40.335
of which I we're very much a part of that scream

657
00:29:40.755 --> 00:29:45.285
of Christianity, um, the, the idea was, you know,

658
00:29:45.285 --> 00:29:46.925
in the Catholic church it had grown up,

659
00:29:46.925 --> 00:29:47.965
especially in the medieval

660
00:29:47.985 --> 00:29:50.365
or the, the sort of the middle ages, uh,

661
00:29:50.965 --> 00:29:54.405
Catholic church had had grown up where they really,

662
00:29:54.405 --> 00:29:58.045
and they, and they codified this later to where today, the,

663
00:29:58.065 --> 00:29:59.405
the Catholic Church would say,

664
00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:02.045
and we would've a major disagreement over this point.

665
00:30:02.435 --> 00:30:05.925
They would say that the tradition of the church,

666
00:30:06.585 --> 00:30:09.085
the traditional teachings, if you've ever seen it,

667
00:30:09.085 --> 00:30:10.845
they have a, you know, the, I mean, I,

668
00:30:10.925 --> 00:30:13.525
I have nothing against Catechisms for sure, but, um,

669
00:30:13.525 --> 00:30:15.605
but there's, the Catholic Catechism is a very big book.

670
00:30:16.025 --> 00:30:20.245
And, and that's like, that is sort of the case law,

671
00:30:20.305 --> 00:30:22.805
or I dunno if that's the best way to say it, of kind of

672
00:30:22.805 --> 00:30:26.285
what they believe about all the, all the nuances.

673
00:30:26.285 --> 00:30:29.325
And they would say their tradition is equal

674
00:30:30.025 --> 00:30:31.365
to the Bible.

675
00:30:32.025 --> 00:30:33.485
And so you have scripture

676
00:30:34.145 --> 00:30:38.045
and you have tradition, the church tradition on par.

677
00:30:38.265 --> 00:30:41.325
And so we would say tradition actually matters, but,

678
00:30:41.385 --> 00:30:43.845
but we would not say that it's authoritative in the same

679
00:30:43.845 --> 00:30:45.565
way, clearly as the Bible is.

680
00:30:45.865 --> 00:30:48.245
And so in the Protestant Reformation, um,

681
00:30:48.245 --> 00:30:49.525
there's a long story involved,

682
00:30:49.545 --> 00:30:51.645
but the question began to say how, I mean,

683
00:30:51.685 --> 00:30:53.085
scholars were just beginning to go

684
00:30:53.085 --> 00:30:56.125
and read the original writings of Aristotle

685
00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:57.165
and Plato and whoever.

686
00:30:57.385 --> 00:30:58.765
And so they began to say, Hey,

687
00:30:58.765 --> 00:31:01.965
why don't we go read the Bible like in its original Greek

688
00:31:02.105 --> 00:31:04.365
and Hebrew, and began to open the Bible

689
00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:07.365
and read it for themselves, not just in the translated Latin

690
00:31:07.745 --> 00:31:09.005
of a thousand years before.

691
00:31:09.425 --> 00:31:12.245
And, uh, they began to go, huh, you know, read the Bible

692
00:31:12.305 --> 00:31:13.725
and it's a little different, right?

693
00:31:13.985 --> 00:31:15.725
It looks a little different than my tradition.

694
00:31:16.145 --> 00:31:17.285
And, uh, and so anyway,

695
00:31:17.305 --> 00:31:21.005
so the word Protestant literally means, uh,

696
00:31:21.275 --> 00:31:22.365
protest, right?

697
00:31:22.465 --> 00:31:25.005
We protest against some of those things.

698
00:31:25.105 --> 00:31:28.765
And anyway, um, the, the point is that we would say in

699
00:31:28.765 --> 00:31:32.325
that movement, uh, we are the beneficiaries of the idea

700
00:31:32.405 --> 00:31:34.125
of going back to the Bible

701
00:31:34.625 --> 00:31:37.325
and going back to the Bible as our primary source.

702
00:31:38.025 --> 00:31:39.565
And, uh, so we'll see there is a place

703
00:31:39.565 --> 00:31:41.645
for a tradition, um, for sure.

704
00:31:41.785 --> 00:31:43.005
But, but the place

705
00:31:43.025 --> 00:31:45.605
of the Bible being really elevated is God's revealed

706
00:31:45.635 --> 00:31:47.405
word so quickly.

707
00:31:47.985 --> 00:31:50.045
Uh, you know, there are the five Sos

708
00:31:50.045 --> 00:31:51.445
of the Protestant Reformation.

709
00:31:51.595 --> 00:31:54.885
Anybody know 'em? Can you sp 'em off? So s scriptura.

710
00:31:55.545 --> 00:31:58.725
So s scriptura means the word

711
00:31:58.725 --> 00:32:02.165
of God alone, anybody else.

712
00:32:04.825 --> 00:32:07.325
So is Christus Christ alone,

713
00:32:09.105 --> 00:32:10.565
soe faith alone.

714
00:32:11.465 --> 00:32:15.205
So gratia, which is grace alone, which means gift.

715
00:32:15.315 --> 00:32:17.125
It's not a matter of earning anything.

716
00:32:17.795 --> 00:32:21.045
Sola scripture, the Bible alone, um,

717
00:32:21.465 --> 00:32:24.205
and sola de glory for the glory of God alone.

718
00:32:25.065 --> 00:32:29.685
And, um, this has to do with who saves us how

719
00:32:29.985 --> 00:32:31.245
and, and why.

720
00:32:31.545 --> 00:32:33.885
And, uh, and so this is the legacy

721
00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:35.205
of the Protestant reformation.

722
00:32:35.405 --> 00:32:38.365
Likewise, um, we, we would hold to an idea

723
00:32:38.465 --> 00:32:41.245
of this number six on the list, the priesthood

724
00:32:41.245 --> 00:32:43.405
of all believers, which, uh, kind

725
00:32:43.405 --> 00:32:45.005
of talks about the nature of the church.

726
00:32:45.665 --> 00:32:48.205
And, uh, and this is where we would say that we don't have

727
00:32:48.205 --> 00:32:51.445
to have a priest to mediate for us a human, uh,

728
00:32:52.205 --> 00:32:53.845
a currently living, how do I wanna say that?

729
00:32:54.265 --> 00:32:58.445
Um, priest to say, hear our confession and,

730
00:32:58.705 --> 00:33:02.045
and stand between us and God, but we have a mediator.

731
00:33:02.465 --> 00:33:05.565
In fact, we have a human mediator who's not only human,

732
00:33:05.585 --> 00:33:06.885
but he's also fully divine,

733
00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:09.965
and he stands in our place, he mediates for us so

734
00:33:09.965 --> 00:33:12.405
that we can now go directly to God

735
00:33:12.405 --> 00:33:13.885
through the Lord Jesus Christ.

736
00:33:14.265 --> 00:33:15.845
And so there's nothing hindering us.

737
00:33:16.225 --> 00:33:19.605
And so in that sense, we're, we become through the,

738
00:33:19.945 --> 00:33:22.885
the miraculous grace of God in our lives, priests

739
00:33:22.885 --> 00:33:25.045
to God most high, and, and in,

740
00:33:25.105 --> 00:33:26.645
and in that way, we,

741
00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:28.925
we don't need another mediator than the one.

742
00:33:28.925 --> 00:33:31.165
We have the Lord Jesus. And then we also

743
00:33:32.415 --> 00:33:36.405
serve a priestly function in the world through the church,

744
00:33:36.405 --> 00:33:40.805
through, through every believer, God is working and,

745
00:33:41.065 --> 00:33:43.245
and moving and speaking through us

746
00:33:43.545 --> 00:33:44.765
and through our lives to other people.

747
00:33:44.825 --> 00:33:47.325
And so anyway, we would say the priesthood of all believers,

748
00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:50.845
just some of the hallmarks of sort of a Protestant, um,

749
00:33:51.675 --> 00:33:53.205
perspective on theology.

750
00:33:53.885 --> 00:33:57.005
I, I like this. I dunno if you've ever seen, um, John, Wes,

751
00:33:57.115 --> 00:34:00.085
John Wesley's, uh, it's what's called the quadrilateral.

752
00:34:00.755 --> 00:34:03.005
It's this image. Does everybody have a copy

753
00:34:03.005 --> 00:34:04.125
of that or can you see it?

754
00:34:04.565 --> 00:34:06.685
I didn't bring to put it up on the board.

755
00:34:07.265 --> 00:34:12.165
Um, so John Wesley, anybody know John Wesley?

756
00:34:12.785 --> 00:34:13.925
Any good Methodist in here?

757
00:34:15.905 --> 00:34:17.485
I'm not a good one, but I grew up Methodist.

758
00:34:18.145 --> 00:34:21.405
And, uh, so anyway, um, John Wesley actually great.

759
00:34:21.475 --> 00:34:23.405
Like, like I have some complaints about the

760
00:34:23.405 --> 00:34:24.445
Methodist Church for sure.

761
00:34:24.905 --> 00:34:26.165
But in its beginning, John

762
00:34:26.165 --> 00:34:29.205
and Charles Wesley were, were really great, uh, in a lot

763
00:34:29.205 --> 00:34:32.405
of ways, um, had some issues, but don't we all.

764
00:34:32.745 --> 00:34:35.885
Anyway, um, so he was born in 1703.

765
00:34:36.105 --> 00:34:40.005
He was a leader in the first great awakening, uh, founder

766
00:34:40.065 --> 00:34:41.285
of the Methodist movement.

767
00:34:41.825 --> 00:34:44.005
And, um, you know, one of the things that, that they,

768
00:34:44.035 --> 00:34:45.485
that he saw, and

769
00:34:45.485 --> 00:34:48.605
that was a real concern in the first great awakening in the

770
00:34:48.625 --> 00:34:52.285
US was that there were a lot of Christians, uh,

771
00:34:52.305 --> 00:34:54.245
or at least people who claimed to be Christian.

772
00:34:54.825 --> 00:34:59.325
And, but there was no like zeal for God, you know,

773
00:34:59.325 --> 00:35:01.765
there was no like passion for God, no, no love

774
00:35:01.765 --> 00:35:03.005
for God, and they wanted to fix that.

775
00:35:05.145 --> 00:35:08.125
And really, in the first grade awakening you, you really saw

776
00:35:08.125 --> 00:35:11.445
that, like those sort of cold dead knowledge of God and,

777
00:35:11.505 --> 00:35:14.525
and believers kind of a name only really came to life.

778
00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:16.565
And there was just a lot of movement in that regard.

779
00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:20.405
But then what that turned into later on, which is often, uh,

780
00:35:20.505 --> 00:35:24.445
the case, is it became this sort of excess of just sort

781
00:35:24.445 --> 00:35:25.445
of experience,

782
00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:28.765
or it became somewhat untethered from, uh,

783
00:35:28.865 --> 00:35:30.685
of the knowledge of about God.

784
00:35:30.685 --> 00:35:32.205
And it was more about the experience

785
00:35:32.235 --> 00:35:33.445
that people were having.

786
00:35:33.545 --> 00:35:36.125
And so people were having these crazy experiences

787
00:35:36.265 --> 00:35:37.445
of the presence of God.

788
00:35:37.445 --> 00:35:39.045
And, and it sort of took on this.

789
00:35:39.225 --> 00:35:41.285
And so it's kinda like, you know, you drive down the road

790
00:35:41.785 --> 00:35:43.605
and you have danger on all side, right?

791
00:35:43.905 --> 00:35:45.925
You can go off the side on the right,

792
00:35:46.145 --> 00:35:47.245
and then if you're not careful,

793
00:35:47.265 --> 00:35:48.885
you can go off the side on the left.

794
00:35:48.985 --> 00:35:51.405
And so it, that's sort of what they saw happening.

795
00:35:51.405 --> 00:35:54.485
And so John Wesley, kind of

796
00:35:55.075 --> 00:35:58.045
what he called his quadrilateral was, um,

797
00:35:58.905 --> 00:36:00.365
was this sort of an idea right here.

798
00:36:00.385 --> 00:36:04.925
He says, um, so, so you have reason,

799
00:36:05.075 --> 00:36:08.445
tradition and experience, so's reason.

800
00:36:08.505 --> 00:36:10.725
We want to, like we're talking about in this class,

801
00:36:10.725 --> 00:36:12.845
we wanna be reasonable, thoughtful,

802
00:36:13.345 --> 00:36:17.205
and intentional about what we think about God and his work.

803
00:36:17.705 --> 00:36:20.605
We want to be careful and diligent

804
00:36:20.905 --> 00:36:25.725
and like we glorify God in the way we think about who he is

805
00:36:25.745 --> 00:36:27.805
and what he's like and what he's done.

806
00:36:28.945 --> 00:36:30.565
But, but our reason

807
00:36:31.545 --> 00:36:35.045
and our logic is also fallen, right?

808
00:36:35.045 --> 00:36:36.765
We live, we're fallen human beings.

809
00:36:36.765 --> 00:36:39.365
So even our thinking, even as we're sometimes trying

810
00:36:39.365 --> 00:36:42.525
to read God's word, we can have strange notions

811
00:36:42.545 --> 00:36:43.605
or we can be misled.

812
00:36:43.875 --> 00:36:47.485
Like, I mean, Satan himself has quoted the Bible, you know,

813
00:36:47.515 --> 00:36:50.805
it's in the beginning of the book he came to, he even said,

814
00:36:51.325 --> 00:36:52.885
he say, did God really say that?

815
00:36:53.455 --> 00:36:56.525
Right? And so twist God's word, it can happen in our minds,

816
00:36:56.865 --> 00:36:58.165
it can happen in our communities,

817
00:36:58.505 --> 00:37:00.005
it can happen in our hearts or lives.

818
00:37:00.195 --> 00:37:01.885
It's kinda like, I think I've told this story before.

819
00:37:02.285 --> 00:37:04.045
I was a brand new believer and I was reading through,

820
00:37:04.045 --> 00:37:05.125
I think it was the book of Romans,

821
00:37:05.285 --> 00:37:07.685
I can't remember which one it is now, but um, and,

822
00:37:07.705 --> 00:37:11.605
and I was reading along and it said, uh, God has now brought

823
00:37:12.135 --> 00:37:15.445
light and immorality to life through the gospel.

824
00:37:16.645 --> 00:37:18.985
And I thought, man, that doesn't sound right.

825
00:37:20.005 --> 00:37:22.065
And I thought about that, how,

826
00:37:22.065 --> 00:37:23.745
how has God brought immorality to I?

827
00:37:23.885 --> 00:37:25.745
It didn't sound negative, it sounded positive.

828
00:37:26.145 --> 00:37:27.465
I called my pastor, he read it

829
00:37:27.465 --> 00:37:28.785
and he was like, man, I don't know.

830
00:37:28.785 --> 00:37:30.945
That's weird. And then we both realized

831
00:37:31.095 --> 00:37:32.105
that was a bad pastor.

832
00:37:32.805 --> 00:37:35.985
We both realized that I was not reading English properly.

833
00:37:36.495 --> 00:37:37.505
It's not immorality,

834
00:37:37.575 --> 00:37:40.145
it's immortality got very light immortality.

835
00:37:40.965 --> 00:37:42.745
So that just happened. And the way I was in reading,

836
00:37:43.085 --> 00:37:44.585
we both just laughed and we're like, wow.

837
00:37:44.965 --> 00:37:46.625
But he felt worse than I didn't.

838
00:37:49.045 --> 00:37:52.265
And, um, so anyway, so like, you know, we get confused.

839
00:37:52.605 --> 00:37:53.665
Uh, we're just falling.

840
00:37:54.365 --> 00:37:56.385
Um, sometimes it's 'cause we're just are,

841
00:37:56.765 --> 00:37:57.825
and we're the victim of that.

842
00:37:57.825 --> 00:38:00.105
Sometimes it's because in our nature

843
00:38:00.245 --> 00:38:01.305
we don't like God's word.

844
00:38:01.325 --> 00:38:04.385
We don't like, like there's things in us that resist that.

845
00:38:04.425 --> 00:38:06.945
I don't wanna believe that. I don't want to do that, right?

846
00:38:07.405 --> 00:38:11.745
And, uh, and so anyway, so there's reason, um, it's also tra

847
00:38:11.805 --> 00:38:12.825
and so that's important,

848
00:38:13.165 --> 00:38:15.265
but there's some issues whether there's tradition.

849
00:38:15.475 --> 00:38:16.985
We've already talked about some of the issues

850
00:38:17.375 --> 00:38:18.625
with tradition, but here's one

851
00:38:18.625 --> 00:38:20.585
of the positive things about tradition, uh,

852
00:38:20.585 --> 00:38:22.865
whether it's in our church or it's in our church history,

853
00:38:23.415 --> 00:38:25.065
it's that, you know, like, believe it

854
00:38:25.065 --> 00:38:27.545
or not, like you're just not the first Christian

855
00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:28.905
who's ever walked on the planet.

856
00:38:29.525 --> 00:38:31.825
You know? And I mean, like, so we, there's a lot

857
00:38:31.825 --> 00:38:35.365
of people in this room, but you, like, if we had in a room,

858
00:38:36.895 --> 00:38:40.165
every Christian that has ever lived since 2000 years ago,

859
00:38:40.505 --> 00:38:42.325
we have an awful lot of people who've been

860
00:38:42.325 --> 00:38:44.045
thinking about God's word.

861
00:38:44.045 --> 00:38:45.925
And sometimes, you know, it's what CS Lewis calls

862
00:38:45.925 --> 00:38:47.485
chronological snobbery.

863
00:38:47.485 --> 00:38:49.325
Sometimes we, we think, well, we,

864
00:38:49.585 --> 00:38:50.885
we understand better than everybody else.

865
00:38:50.985 --> 00:38:52.765
You know, I don't know what was wrong with those guys.

866
00:38:53.515 --> 00:38:55.765
Well, one day people will think that about us.

867
00:38:56.145 --> 00:38:58.165
You know, what was wrong with those guys?

868
00:38:58.825 --> 00:39:00.045
And, uh, some of it they'll be

869
00:39:00.045 --> 00:39:01.085
right, some of they'll be wrong.

870
00:39:01.585 --> 00:39:04.285
But, um, but so just the idea that,

871
00:39:04.285 --> 00:39:08.405
that we really don't have to think about God's word alone.

872
00:39:08.585 --> 00:39:12.325
We have one another. We have believers who've gone

873
00:39:12.325 --> 00:39:13.765
before us for generations.

874
00:39:14.305 --> 00:39:15.725
And so tradition is valuable,

875
00:39:15.825 --> 00:39:18.405
but if it's all you've got, then, uh,

876
00:39:18.405 --> 00:39:20.365
then you have this limited, what you might

877
00:39:20.365 --> 00:39:21.725
call leftover manna.

878
00:39:21.905 --> 00:39:23.645
You know, the man would go bad in the wilderness.

879
00:39:23.705 --> 00:39:26.325
And, and it's like, you know, for this generation, how's,

880
00:39:26.545 --> 00:39:28.965
how are we, you know, understanding God's word

881
00:39:28.965 --> 00:39:31.485
and communicating that in the world anyway?

882
00:39:31.945 --> 00:39:35.285
So, uh, the tradition can be dead, it can be vital.

883
00:39:35.825 --> 00:39:37.245
Uh, it's just like institutions.

884
00:39:37.275 --> 00:39:40.085
They can be, uh, really keepers of the flame

885
00:39:40.145 --> 00:39:43.245
or they can really, uh, you know, be a huge impediment.

886
00:39:43.305 --> 00:39:45.605
So anyway, there's that. There's also experience.

887
00:39:46.025 --> 00:39:47.805
You know, we sometimes when we say, man,

888
00:39:47.805 --> 00:39:50.565
if I experience, were you getting my attention?

889
00:39:51.025 --> 00:39:52.125
No. Where are we at on time?

890
00:39:52.125 --> 00:39:56.805
Just, it helps me 6 58 right now. Okay.

891
00:39:57.585 --> 00:40:02.125
Um, so our experience, like experience is important,

892
00:40:02.625 --> 00:40:06.645
but believe it or not, experience itself is fallible, right?

893
00:40:06.655 --> 00:40:08.925
Especially when we're talking about this subjective

894
00:40:08.925 --> 00:40:10.165
nature of our feelings.

895
00:40:10.665 --> 00:40:13.645
Um, you know, you have a dream or,

896
00:40:14.105 --> 00:40:15.965
or you, you have an emotion

897
00:40:16.225 --> 00:40:18.485
and you can feel like, like, is that from God?

898
00:40:19.615 --> 00:40:20.875
Or what does that mean?

899
00:40:21.655 --> 00:40:24.195
And, and there's just not concrete answers to that.

900
00:40:24.695 --> 00:40:27.915
And sometimes God moves subjectively in our hearts,

901
00:40:27.915 --> 00:40:29.355
and sometimes he's not.

902
00:40:29.355 --> 00:40:32.195
Sometimes it's just the pizza from the night before, right?

903
00:40:32.615 --> 00:40:36.435
And it's like, and so our, our, our experience

904
00:40:36.435 --> 00:40:40.275
and our emotions, they need to be taught by God's word.

905
00:40:40.275 --> 00:40:42.995
They need to be interpreted by God's word.

906
00:40:42.995 --> 00:40:44.835
They're not enough in and of themselves.

907
00:40:44.935 --> 00:40:47.795
So anyway, so that was just kind of what Wesley was trying

908
00:40:47.795 --> 00:40:50.715
to capture is he saw people going on both sides in their

909
00:40:50.715 --> 00:40:52.475
experience, their tradition with the logic.

910
00:40:53.015 --> 00:40:55.875
Um, I guess it was a three sided road, which is different.

911
00:40:55.895 --> 00:40:57.155
But anyway, um,

912
00:40:57.935 --> 00:40:59.275
so I like that, and I think that's important.

913
00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:04.075
So the third aspect here is, uh,

914
00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:07.955
within Protestantism Protestant theology, uh, we hold

915
00:41:07.985 --> 00:41:10.675
what would be called an evangelical theology.

916
00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:13.195
Now, I know that like evangelicalism sort

917
00:41:13.195 --> 00:41:15.755
of in the media kind of has a bad rap today.

918
00:41:15.775 --> 00:41:17.595
And, and I don't know where you are on all that.

919
00:41:17.595 --> 00:41:21.435
All that means is historically speaking, what it meant

920
00:41:21.435 --> 00:41:23.635
to be an evangelical Christian is across

921
00:41:24.095 --> 00:41:25.395
denominational lines.

922
00:41:25.535 --> 00:41:27.555
Do you believe that the Bible's true?

923
00:41:27.575 --> 00:41:31.115
And the Jesus Christ is the only way to know God and um,

924
00:41:31.495 --> 00:41:32.675
and believe in the virgin birth

925
00:41:32.675 --> 00:41:34.125
and the resurrection and all that?

926
00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.245
That's sort of all I meant.

927
00:41:36.985 --> 00:41:39.445
And, and so those four primary categories

928
00:41:39.825 --> 00:41:43.245
or characteristics of historic evangelical Protestantism,

929
00:41:43.495 --> 00:41:46.365
which is conversion is faith

930
00:41:46.385 --> 00:41:50.125
and action, uh, trustworthiness and authority of the Bible

931
00:41:50.305 --> 00:41:52.325
and the centrality of the cross.

932
00:41:52.825 --> 00:41:55.205
So conversion is this just means that we believe

933
00:41:55.555 --> 00:41:57.725
that there are no grandchildren in the family of God,

934
00:41:57.995 --> 00:42:00.405
that you have to be born again, right?

935
00:42:00.405 --> 00:42:02.405
If that's, if you're raised in a Christian

936
00:42:02.405 --> 00:42:03.725
family, that that's unique.

937
00:42:04.235 --> 00:42:06.485
Like in fact, I love boring testimonies.

938
00:42:06.715 --> 00:42:08.285
Like I want people to, kids

939
00:42:08.285 --> 00:42:11.205
to grow up all they ever knew was the truth of God's word.

940
00:42:11.205 --> 00:42:13.405
And go, yeah, I'm a sinner in need of a savior,

941
00:42:13.545 --> 00:42:15.485
and I believe that, and he's changed my life,

942
00:42:15.585 --> 00:42:18.125
but it didn't take me, you know, going down every road.

943
00:42:18.785 --> 00:42:20.725
And, uh, but there we also believe

944
00:42:20.725 --> 00:42:22.605
that some people didn't grow up that way, or,

945
00:42:22.825 --> 00:42:24.165
or some people abandoned that road.

946
00:42:24.665 --> 00:42:26.965
And there's dramatic, you know, problems

947
00:42:26.965 --> 00:42:28.005
that can come in our lives

948
00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:30.765
and all that dramatically changes by the grace of God.

949
00:42:30.945 --> 00:42:33.045
We believe you have to believe and be born again.

950
00:42:33.545 --> 00:42:35.365
And, uh, so you have to trust in Christ,

951
00:42:36.785 --> 00:42:37.845
uh, faith in action.

952
00:42:38.425 --> 00:42:42.005
Um, just that our faith affects our lives.

953
00:42:42.145 --> 00:42:44.925
It ought to be demonstrated, um, by us reaching out

954
00:42:44.925 --> 00:42:47.685
to the world and even loving the people around us,

955
00:42:47.715 --> 00:42:51.245
even serving sacrificially, um, the trustworthiness

956
00:42:51.245 --> 00:42:52.245
and authority of the Bible.

957
00:42:52.745 --> 00:42:55.325
Um, just where the authority of God's word is central

958
00:42:55.545 --> 00:42:56.605
and reliable.

959
00:42:57.145 --> 00:42:59.405
And so, like, we'd rather say, like the Bible says,

960
00:42:59.585 --> 00:43:01.205
let God be true in every man a liar.

961
00:43:01.205 --> 00:43:02.805
Or sort of the idea of sometimes if, like,

962
00:43:02.805 --> 00:43:05.285
if I'm reading the Bible and I think I'm not sure

963
00:43:05.285 --> 00:43:06.605
that I like what I'm reading,

964
00:43:07.065 --> 00:43:08.885
the problem's probably with me, right?

965
00:43:08.945 --> 00:43:12.165
And not the Bible. And so the idea is how do we humbly

966
00:43:12.715 --> 00:43:14.405
walk in light of God's word and know

967
00:43:14.405 --> 00:43:16.005
and believe what God has said to be true?

968
00:43:16.385 --> 00:43:18.485
Um, and then finally the centrality of the cross

969
00:43:18.865 --> 00:43:20.365
and the resurrection of Jesus, that

970
00:43:20.365 --> 00:43:21.485
that's the center of our faith.

971
00:43:21.825 --> 00:43:23.005
So it makes us Christians

972
00:43:23.005 --> 00:43:26.005
and we believe the Christ is who the Bible says he is.

973
00:43:26.275 --> 00:43:28.805
He's ruling in reigning now he's coming again in glory.

974
00:43:29.225 --> 00:43:31.245
And, uh, we have to, uh, we have to know him.

975
00:43:31.385 --> 00:43:36.225
So, um, so when it comes to doctrinal issues, though,

976
00:43:36.245 --> 00:43:37.825
I'm gonna, there, there's a lot to cover.

977
00:43:37.825 --> 00:43:39.585
There's even a lot of verses here.

978
00:43:39.715 --> 00:43:40.745
We're definitely not gonna read.

979
00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:43.345
So you might look these up as you go along.

980
00:43:43.765 --> 00:43:45.985
Um, you may even think of others as well.

981
00:43:45.985 --> 00:43:47.145
Feel free to write those down.

982
00:43:48.245 --> 00:43:51.385
Um, so there are primary and secondary doctrines.

983
00:43:51.385 --> 00:43:55.745
There's major and minor doctrines, and, um,

984
00:43:56.085 --> 00:43:58.345
and so, you know, not everything is equally

985
00:43:58.345 --> 00:43:59.785
important, right?

986
00:44:00.005 --> 00:44:03.105
So we would say everything in God's word is important,

987
00:44:03.885 --> 00:44:06.345
but it's important that we understand that not everything

988
00:44:07.125 --> 00:44:09.225
is equally important.

989
00:44:09.685 --> 00:44:12.185
So I love this. We'll talk about it more, uh, later.

990
00:44:12.605 --> 00:44:14.945
At some point, at least if you're in the seminary class,

991
00:44:14.965 --> 00:44:16.665
we will, they read an article on this,

992
00:44:16.685 --> 00:44:19.585
but Al Moler had this article years ago called

993
00:44:19.615 --> 00:44:21.145
Theological Triage.

994
00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:23.865
And, um, and so triage, right?

995
00:44:24.185 --> 00:44:27.465
Actually I was, uh, just revisiting this kind of came out

996
00:44:27.465 --> 00:44:29.065
of at least the, the theology.

997
00:44:29.095 --> 00:44:32.165
This sort of comes out of a, a wartime scenario.

998
00:44:32.745 --> 00:44:34.925
Um, I can't remember what the situation was,

999
00:44:35.065 --> 00:44:37.845
but there was, um, there was a, a war,

1000
00:44:37.845 --> 00:44:40.605
maybe I'm thinking it was even somewhere in Europe where,

1001
00:44:40.615 --> 00:44:42.645
where everyone that came in injured, didn't matter

1002
00:44:42.645 --> 00:44:43.805
what their injury was,

1003
00:44:44.275 --> 00:44:46.485
that you got treated in chronological order.

1004
00:44:47.105 --> 00:44:51.285
And so if you had a, you lost a fingernail, you got treated

1005
00:44:51.285 --> 00:44:53.205
before the guy with the head wound, right?

1006
00:44:53.585 --> 00:44:55.725
And so they began to triage that.

1007
00:44:55.905 --> 00:44:58.445
You could probably tell us more, give a better summary.

1008
00:44:58.745 --> 00:45:00.845
So if you want to clean, clean this up, talk

1009
00:45:00.845 --> 00:45:01.925
to t It's in that book.

1010
00:45:02.235 --> 00:45:04.325
Yeah, it's in the book. Okay, yeah, there you go.

1011
00:45:04.705 --> 00:45:08.765
Anyway, so, but the main point is that we try

1012
00:45:08.765 --> 00:45:11.085
to order things by importance.

1013
00:45:11.705 --> 00:45:13.925
And, um, and so kind of, if you've heard

1014
00:45:13.925 --> 00:45:16.005
of fundamentalism being kind of a bad word,

1015
00:45:16.275 --> 00:45:18.485
like I would say I'm a fundamentalist in the sense

1016
00:45:18.485 --> 00:45:20.725
that I believe in the fundamentals of the faith,

1017
00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:23.725
but kind of as a movement, it kind of had a tendency

1018
00:45:23.725 --> 00:45:26.525
to make everything equally important.

1019
00:45:27.145 --> 00:45:29.405
And so, uh, so everything's fighting worse.

1020
00:45:29.665 --> 00:45:32.045
That's why it's in the book, right?

1021
00:45:32.045 --> 00:45:33.485
Finding the right hills to die.

1022
00:45:33.695 --> 00:45:37.525
There are hills to die on, but it's not every single hill.

1023
00:45:37.705 --> 00:45:40.645
So anyway, it says first order, second order, third order,

1024
00:45:40.815 --> 00:45:42.085
first order doctrines.

1025
00:45:42.355 --> 00:45:46.125
Like a year ago, I guess it was, you know, John Todd on the,

1026
00:45:46.145 --> 00:45:49.965
uh, Todd on the first things, it's sort of this idea, is

1027
00:45:49.965 --> 00:45:51.925
that what he, that's what the name was, right?

1028
00:45:52.385 --> 00:45:55.285
Um, and so, so first order, if you deny this,

1029
00:45:55.285 --> 00:45:58.245
you're basically not a Christian question of the authority

1030
00:45:58.245 --> 00:46:00.285
of the Bible, the deity of Christ, the nature

1031
00:46:00.285 --> 00:46:01.525
of the trinity, and so on.

1032
00:46:02.305 --> 00:46:04.645
Big rocks, the big rocks, there you go.

1033
00:46:05.145 --> 00:46:08.405
And so the smaller rocks, the second order doctrines, uh,

1034
00:46:08.545 --> 00:46:12.165
you can recognize, uh, that this person's a Christian all,

1035
00:46:12.165 --> 00:46:15.205
even though few maybe don't do church together, right?

1036
00:46:15.225 --> 00:46:16.965
We, we view the Lord's suffer real differently,

1037
00:46:16.985 --> 00:46:19.725
or we baptize some baptize babies and some don't,

1038
00:46:20.265 --> 00:46:21.605
or whatever it is.

1039
00:46:21.665 --> 00:46:23.485
You know, there's different, different things,

1040
00:46:23.585 --> 00:46:25.805
but genuine Christians disagree on them.

1041
00:46:26.345 --> 00:46:28.245
And the third order doctrines, it's just,

1042
00:46:28.245 --> 00:46:29.805
we just agree to disagree.

1043
00:46:30.115 --> 00:46:32.165
This could be your timing of, you know,

1044
00:46:32.225 --> 00:46:35.005
how you view the end times your eschatology, uh,

1045
00:46:35.005 --> 00:46:37.805
your views on predestination in a granular manner.

1046
00:46:38.265 --> 00:46:40.765
Um, what, what you think about the methylene, right?

1047
00:46:41.225 --> 00:46:43.565
Hey, we can all go to church together if you've got a

1048
00:46:43.565 --> 00:46:44.885
different opinion about the methylene.

1049
00:46:45.385 --> 00:46:48.285
And, um, so the historic way of talking about this

1050
00:46:48.825 --> 00:46:50.405
is this saying, and I'd encourage you

1051
00:46:50.405 --> 00:46:51.805
to get familiar with it if you're not.

1052
00:46:52.025 --> 00:46:55.605
It says in essentials, it's first order, doctrines unity.

1053
00:46:56.225 --> 00:46:58.525
So what it means to be a Christian in

1054
00:46:59.025 --> 00:47:00.805
non-essentials, there's liberty.

1055
00:47:01.425 --> 00:47:03.965
And then in all things there's charity for love.

1056
00:47:04.505 --> 00:47:09.445
And so graciousness towards one another, okay?

1057
00:47:09.705 --> 00:47:13.485
So, uh, mystery paradox, contradictions and tension.

1058
00:47:13.825 --> 00:47:16.725
God is mysterious is the word.

1059
00:47:17.465 --> 00:47:20.045
And so we go back to Deuteronomy 29, 29.

1060
00:47:20.215 --> 00:47:22.325
There are mysteries. In fact, when you read,

1061
00:47:22.325 --> 00:47:23.805
especially the New Testament,

1062
00:47:24.265 --> 00:47:25.445
I'd encourage you pay attention

1063
00:47:25.585 --> 00:47:28.325
to when you encounter the word mystery.

1064
00:47:28.995 --> 00:47:30.645
This is a word that Martin Lutheran loved,

1065
00:47:30.645 --> 00:47:31.765
like Lutherans love this.

1066
00:47:31.845 --> 00:47:33.045
I got any Lutherans in the room.

1067
00:47:33.315 --> 00:47:34.765
They talk a lot about mystery

1068
00:47:34.765 --> 00:47:38.165
because that it's actually like an important word in the

1069
00:47:38.165 --> 00:47:39.885
Bible, uh, in the New Testament.

1070
00:47:39.905 --> 00:47:42.805
And what Paul, typically, when he's using that word,

1071
00:47:42.995 --> 00:47:46.845
what he means is, here's a thing that we didn't know

1072
00:47:46.935 --> 00:47:51.285
until God made it known, especially in regard to the nature

1073
00:47:51.305 --> 00:47:52.445
of Christ and the gospel.

1074
00:47:52.825 --> 00:47:55.085
That's, and that's his mystery that was hidden

1075
00:47:55.145 --> 00:47:58.405
for the ages past, but now has been made known, right?

1076
00:47:58.505 --> 00:48:01.285
So anyway, so, but, but there are other mysteries.

1077
00:48:01.285 --> 00:48:04.085
Deuteronomy 29, the secret things belong

1078
00:48:04.085 --> 00:48:06.405
to the Lord our God, but the things revealed,

1079
00:48:06.945 --> 00:48:09.765
the mysteries explained, belonged to us.

1080
00:48:11.705 --> 00:48:14.645
So there's contradictions that we can have,

1081
00:48:14.665 --> 00:48:16.645
and we don't, we don't want contradictions,

1082
00:48:16.645 --> 00:48:17.805
we don't like contradictions.

1083
00:48:18.035 --> 00:48:19.565
This is where things actually,

1084
00:48:19.625 --> 00:48:23.885
two things literally cannot be true at the same time, right?

1085
00:48:24.745 --> 00:48:26.485
The cat is not a dog.

1086
00:48:27.585 --> 00:48:30.885
You can't be walking the dog and not be walking the dog.

1087
00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:35.125
At the same time. A circle is not a triangle,

1088
00:48:35.785 --> 00:48:37.245
and they can't be true at the same time.

1089
00:48:37.705 --> 00:48:41.405
And so in the Bible, there is never a contradiction.

1090
00:48:42.105 --> 00:48:46.965
If you listen to media, if you, if you have ever been

1091
00:48:46.965 --> 00:48:50.725
to a university, they, everybody's ready to tell you

1092
00:48:50.725 --> 00:48:52.125
how many contradictions are in the Bible.

1093
00:48:52.195 --> 00:48:54.565
There's actually no true contradictions in the Bible.

1094
00:48:54.875 --> 00:48:57.125
What, what follows is this word, there are

1095
00:48:57.355 --> 00:48:59.085
what you would call a paradox.

1096
00:48:59.655 --> 00:49:02.525
There are things that might seem to be contradictory,

1097
00:49:02.905 --> 00:49:07.165
but they're not so like, like it's the word, uh, seemingly

1098
00:49:07.905 --> 00:49:11.565
or uh, like have you ever, what's the phrase, thinking

1099
00:49:11.565 --> 00:49:15.885
of paradoxes you have sometimes we'll say you can have

1100
00:49:15.995 --> 00:49:17.245
more with less.

1101
00:49:18.265 --> 00:49:20.405
You ever heard that? What's happening?

1102
00:49:21.385 --> 00:49:22.805
How can you have more with less?

1103
00:49:23.625 --> 00:49:25.205
Sounds like a contradiction,

1104
00:49:26.025 --> 00:49:28.245
but yet we put it on bumper stickers,

1105
00:49:28.305 --> 00:49:30.725
and at least somebody did somewhere.

1106
00:49:32.465 --> 00:49:34.765
What's it mean you can have a full life, even if you get rid

1107
00:49:34.765 --> 00:49:36.525
of all your toys, um,

1108
00:49:36.545 --> 00:49:39.005
and maybe even you'd be happier if you declutter, right?

1109
00:49:39.085 --> 00:49:42.485
That's kind of what that means. Um, and so anyway, think or,

1110
00:49:42.505 --> 00:49:46.465
or you might say, say theologically, uh, you know,

1111
00:49:46.465 --> 00:49:48.745
often we would say, you even see the, the,

1112
00:49:48.965 --> 00:49:50.905
the characters in the Bible wrestle with this.

1113
00:49:51.445 --> 00:49:54.505
Um, it, see, I, it seems like

1114
00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:58.385
God is not in control, but he is.

1115
00:49:59.285 --> 00:50:01.385
And that's actually paradox we often wrestle

1116
00:50:01.495 --> 00:50:03.425
with at the level of our lives.

1117
00:50:04.165 --> 00:50:07.345
And so anyway, so paradox is not contradiction.

1118
00:50:07.885 --> 00:50:10.385
Um, but those are important distinctions.

1119
00:50:11.245 --> 00:50:15.065
Um, Isaiah 55, 8, my ways are above your ways,

1120
00:50:15.205 --> 00:50:18.065
and my thoughts are above your thoughts, says the Lord.

1121
00:50:18.245 --> 00:50:20.665
So it means if you're struggling to get your mind

1122
00:50:20.665 --> 00:50:23.545
around something that's true about God, then like,

1123
00:50:23.595 --> 00:50:24.705
don't be discouraged.

1124
00:50:25.245 --> 00:50:26.505
It doesn't mean there's not an answer.

1125
00:50:26.885 --> 00:50:29.005
It doesn't mean you'll be forever stumped by that,

1126
00:50:29.385 --> 00:50:32.045
but it does mean that sometimes it can be

1127
00:50:32.045 --> 00:50:33.165
a little hard to grasp.

1128
00:50:33.505 --> 00:50:35.485
So we want to persevere in that.

1129
00:50:36.745 --> 00:50:40.965
Um, so it, it's kinda like,

1130
00:50:40.965 --> 00:50:42.805
so it's this tension, okay?

1131
00:50:42.805 --> 00:50:43.965
Like there's another, uh,

1132
00:50:48.465 --> 00:50:49.405
how are we doing on time?

1133
00:50:50.255 --> 00:50:53.085
7 0 9. Oh, okay.

1134
00:50:54.545 --> 00:50:57.685
You're doing better than, okay, that's good to know.

1135
00:51:00.755 --> 00:51:02.885
Alright, So here's a huge point of tension.

1136
00:51:03.985 --> 00:51:06.885
You can fall off this way, you can fall off this way,

1137
00:51:08.025 --> 00:51:10.525
or you can sort of balance

1138
00:51:16.305 --> 00:51:17.285
In these tensions.

1139
00:51:18.665 --> 00:51:22.925
So for example, uh, we say Jesus Christ

1140
00:51:23.585 --> 00:51:26.045
is fully God and fully man.

1141
00:51:26.995 --> 00:51:30.725
Anybody here completely understand that, okay?

1142
00:51:30.745 --> 00:51:32.205
But we would say that's what the Bible teaches.

1143
00:51:32.825 --> 00:51:35.365
It actually makes sense if we follow the logic

1144
00:51:35.365 --> 00:51:37.005
of the Bible and we hold that to be true.

1145
00:51:37.185 --> 00:51:40.685
But it's sometimes hard to get your mind around, uh,

1146
00:51:40.825 --> 00:51:42.605
we believe what we believe about the Bible.

1147
00:51:42.985 --> 00:51:44.725
We say it is the word of God,

1148
00:51:45.585 --> 00:51:48.965
but we also say it was literally written by men

1149
00:51:49.785 --> 00:51:52.325
and so well, which isn't right?

1150
00:51:52.465 --> 00:51:53.685
So it's not a contradiction.

1151
00:51:53.835 --> 00:51:55.245
There's some mystery, there's some

1152
00:51:55.245 --> 00:51:56.605
paradox and there's tension.

1153
00:51:57.305 --> 00:52:00.685
Uh, if you, so, just like Christ, you can say, you know,

1154
00:52:00.685 --> 00:52:02.205
Jesus is only God.

1155
00:52:02.275 --> 00:52:03.445
There's no way he's a man.

1156
00:52:03.635 --> 00:52:07.165
Well, then we lose all that biblical teaching and,

1157
00:52:07.185 --> 00:52:09.725
and you leave Christianity in the same way.

1158
00:52:09.725 --> 00:52:12.605
You say the Bible is only the word of man.

1159
00:52:13.035 --> 00:52:15.445
Well, you clearly lose Christianity.

1160
00:52:16.105 --> 00:52:19.005
Um, and so, but you have to hold the two together,

1161
00:52:19.585 --> 00:52:24.325
or, uh, you might say with salvation, um, you know,

1162
00:52:24.325 --> 00:52:27.845
we see in the Bible talks about God chooses his people on

1163
00:52:27.845 --> 00:52:29.325
the one hand, and then on the other hand,

1164
00:52:29.325 --> 00:52:30.965
we're told we have to trust them.

1165
00:52:31.305 --> 00:52:33.925
And so we choose God, he chooses us, right?

1166
00:52:33.925 --> 00:52:35.765
There's paradox that goes along.

1167
00:52:35.825 --> 00:52:40.525
So, um, we say you can't lose your salvation, absolutely,

1168
00:52:41.025 --> 00:52:43.365
but we're also told we have to persevere in the faith.

1169
00:52:43.905 --> 00:52:45.485
And so we've got to continue.

1170
00:52:45.745 --> 00:52:48.805
Uh, some of the evidence of God's grace in our life is

1171
00:52:48.835 --> 00:52:49.845
that he keeps us.

1172
00:52:50.145 --> 00:52:53.325
But it looks like me going, you know what, today

1173
00:52:54.225 --> 00:52:56.245
I'm gonna read my Bible, I'm gonna trust God,

1174
00:52:56.785 --> 00:52:57.925
I'm gonna fellowship with you.

1175
00:52:58.585 --> 00:52:59.925
I'm gonna repent.

1176
00:52:59.925 --> 00:53:02.525
When I've sinned, I'm gonna, you know, keep going.

1177
00:53:03.305 --> 00:53:04.565
And by God's grace we do it.

1178
00:53:04.565 --> 00:53:06.205
So anyway, attention paradox, all that.

1179
00:53:06.465 --> 00:53:09.645
And, and so what it, what it ought to do is, uh, remind us

1180
00:53:09.645 --> 00:53:11.445
that we're really dependent on God.

1181
00:53:12.025 --> 00:53:15.005
And so we learn to grow best when we stay humble

1182
00:53:15.545 --> 00:53:17.525
before the Lord and we're dependent on him.

1183
00:53:18.065 --> 00:53:21.805
And, um, and so it, it should help, help us to do that.

1184
00:53:23.465 --> 00:53:28.445
Um, this quote by this guy, Robert Fugate

1185
00:53:28.995 --> 00:53:33.045
says, where biblically sound, systematic theology is absent,

1186
00:53:34.285 --> 00:53:36.925
A vacuum does not remain.

1187
00:53:37.895 --> 00:53:41.365
Unbiblical theology replaces a biblical theology.

1188
00:53:41.425 --> 00:53:45.125
In its absence. Systematic theology cannot be avoided.

1189
00:53:45.545 --> 00:53:48.125
It is never a question of theology or no theology.

1190
00:53:48.465 --> 00:53:51.805
It is always a question of what theology, biblical theology

1191
00:53:51.945 --> 00:53:53.125
or unbiblical theology.

1192
00:53:54.035 --> 00:53:56.475
Theology is an inescapable concept.

1193
00:53:57.315 --> 00:53:59.475
Everyone has a theology, whether it's good

1194
00:53:59.815 --> 00:54:02.315
or bad, consistent or inconsistent.

1195
00:54:03.115 --> 00:54:05.915
Everyone is a theologian. Alright?

1196
00:54:05.975 --> 00:54:08.235
So welcome to theology class

1197
00:54:08.235 --> 00:54:11.275
where you guys have all been anointed theologians.

1198
00:54:11.775 --> 00:54:14.115
You actually walked in the door as theologians

1199
00:54:14.115 --> 00:54:16.395
because if you've ever thought about God,

1200
00:54:16.615 --> 00:54:18.315
you're having theological thoughts.

1201
00:54:18.415 --> 00:54:21.435
So you might as well just own it and embrace it

1202
00:54:21.815 --> 00:54:23.515
and begin to do it well,

1203
00:54:23.865 --> 00:54:26.995
because all of us at times, we have our weak points

1204
00:54:27.415 --> 00:54:28.675
and we want to grow and change,

1205
00:54:29.515 --> 00:54:32.215
and we need, need God's grace to do so.

1206
00:54:32.475 --> 00:54:36.655
Um, okay, so two main themes we emphasize, uh,

1207
00:54:36.915 --> 00:54:39.455
number one here, truth and life.

1208
00:54:39.995 --> 00:54:42.335
It means God's word, what he's revealed,

1209
00:54:42.565 --> 00:54:44.415
it's ultimate and it matters.

1210
00:54:44.525 --> 00:54:46.175
This is universal for us

1211
00:54:46.555 --> 00:54:49.135
and everyone around the planet throughout

1212
00:54:49.135 --> 00:54:50.575
history and in the future.

1213
00:54:51.035 --> 00:54:53.015
And then secondarily, it has to do with life.

1214
00:54:53.085 --> 00:54:57.015
It's that we live our lives in light of the truth

1215
00:54:57.275 --> 00:54:58.455
of God's word.

1216
00:54:58.755 --> 00:55:02.775
And that way we understand that everything is theological.

1217
00:55:03.725 --> 00:55:07.575
Okay? So 10 reasons why we should study systematic theology.

1218
00:55:07.835 --> 00:55:12.095
It addresses the most important subject in the universe,

1219
00:55:12.795 --> 00:55:15.055
and that is that it's talking about God himself.

1220
00:55:16.555 --> 00:55:20.815
And God, as we've seen Deuteronomy 29 29, again, God has

1221
00:55:21.525 --> 00:55:22.975
made himself known.

1222
00:55:23.635 --> 00:55:26.215
And so God's word is true, it's available,

1223
00:55:26.715 --> 00:55:30.455
and we need to avail ourselves of those truths.

1224
00:55:30.475 --> 00:55:35.405
So, um, in fact, uh, systematic theology, it,

1225
00:55:35.605 --> 00:55:38.845
it probably still referred to in some ways this way,

1226
00:55:38.865 --> 00:55:41.885
but it, it used to be known as sort of, I don't remember

1227
00:55:41.885 --> 00:55:45.285
what the saying was, but kind of the, the crown jewel of,

1228
00:55:45.385 --> 00:55:46.645
uh, of learning.

1229
00:55:47.385 --> 00:55:50.125
So you would, you would learn history and philosophy

1230
00:55:50.665 --> 00:55:55.125
and science, and then you would tie all that truth together

1231
00:55:55.945 --> 00:55:58.765
in light of the nature of God and who he is.

1232
00:55:59.145 --> 00:56:02.325
And so theology is sort of the crown jewel on top

1233
00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:03.805
of knowledge, all knowledge.

1234
00:56:04.655 --> 00:56:07.925
Seven 15. Thank you sir.

1235
00:56:09.595 --> 00:56:11.485
It's like break train coming through.

1236
00:56:11.645 --> 00:56:16.125
There we are done at seven 30, right? Yeah.

1237
00:56:16.155 --> 00:56:19.405
Okay, so, um, there's a reason I'm tracking time.

1238
00:56:20.445 --> 00:56:22.925
A I'm terrible at tracking time

1239
00:56:23.185 --> 00:56:25.285
and BI have something we're doing a minute.

1240
00:56:26.025 --> 00:56:28.845
Um, okay, so let me go through this quickly.

1241
00:56:29.865 --> 00:56:33.645
Uh, we need to study theology like this for obedience.

1242
00:56:34.585 --> 00:56:37.845
We need to do so for two main obedience in two ways, right?

1243
00:56:37.845 --> 00:56:40.165
There's two things God, us revealed

1244
00:56:40.165 --> 00:56:42.045
that should guide our whole lives.

1245
00:56:42.505 --> 00:56:43.805
We call it the great commandment

1246
00:56:43.805 --> 00:56:46.565
and the great commission, the great commandment says what?

1247
00:56:47.065 --> 00:56:50.765
You should love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul,

1248
00:56:51.355 --> 00:56:52.565
mind and strength.

1249
00:56:52.945 --> 00:56:55.485
Second one, similar. Love your neighbor as yourself.

1250
00:56:55.715 --> 00:56:57.445
It's where practical implication,

1251
00:56:58.075 --> 00:57:00.125
application of love for God.

1252
00:57:00.585 --> 00:57:04.045
And so in part love for God, you, you called the love God

1253
00:57:04.045 --> 00:57:06.365
with all our minds we think of.

1254
00:57:06.365 --> 00:57:07.445
We also also talk about,

1255
00:57:07.495 --> 00:57:09.805
often talk about love God with all our hearts.

1256
00:57:09.805 --> 00:57:11.885
And we wanna stir our emotions, which is right,

1257
00:57:12.425 --> 00:57:14.245
but we also need to stir our minds

1258
00:57:14.705 --> 00:57:16.205
and love God with all of our minds.

1259
00:57:17.705 --> 00:57:21.525
Uh, um, Read these,

1260
00:57:21.755 --> 00:57:23.685
read these quotes later if you like.

1261
00:57:23.765 --> 00:57:25.725
I want to keep moving. It's just the, it's kind

1262
00:57:25.725 --> 00:57:27.285
of the old analogy of the freight train.

1263
00:57:27.905 --> 00:57:30.165
Um, you, you guys ever seen the analogy of the train

1264
00:57:30.575 --> 00:57:32.765
where the engine is the truth

1265
00:57:33.625 --> 00:57:36.745
and it's pulling the freight of, oh,

1266
00:57:36.905 --> 00:57:39.825
your other thought will, will,

1267
00:57:39.885 --> 00:57:41.105
and thoughts will and emotion.

1268
00:57:41.565 --> 00:57:43.465
And so the feel your feelings matter.

1269
00:57:43.865 --> 00:57:46.265
I don't want to neglect that, but it's,

1270
00:57:46.265 --> 00:57:48.105
but they're in the caboose, right?

1271
00:57:48.215 --> 00:57:49.665
They're, they're, they're carriage.

1272
00:57:49.735 --> 00:57:51.665
They're, uh, they're being pulled along.

1273
00:57:51.665 --> 00:57:53.985
They ought to be pulled. So they ought to be there.

1274
00:57:54.405 --> 00:57:56.665
We ought to have our hearts stirred towards God.

1275
00:57:57.045 --> 00:57:59.305
We ought to have love for God and passion for God,

1276
00:57:59.725 --> 00:58:02.865
but it is brought along by the steam engine

1277
00:58:03.445 --> 00:58:05.265
of God's truth and God's word.

1278
00:58:05.535 --> 00:58:07.265
Okay? So love for God with all

1279
00:58:07.265 --> 00:58:08.385
of our heart, soul, mind, and strength.

1280
00:58:08.485 --> 00:58:09.745
The second way we obey God is

1281
00:58:09.745 --> 00:58:13.985
through obeying the Great Commission, uh, Matthew 28 18.

1282
00:58:13.985 --> 00:58:15.585
Hopefully you're very familiar with this.

1283
00:58:16.005 --> 00:58:17.785
Uh, it's the call to go out into the world

1284
00:58:18.245 --> 00:58:19.745
and as we go to do what?

1285
00:58:20.285 --> 00:58:24.745
To make disciples of all nations, teaching them everything

1286
00:58:24.745 --> 00:58:26.305
that he has taught.

1287
00:58:26.655 --> 00:58:27.865
Okay, well, if you don't know what that is,

1288
00:58:27.865 --> 00:58:30.185
you don't understand it, you're gonna be, it's gonna be hard

1289
00:58:30.185 --> 00:58:32.145
to communicate to other people.

1290
00:58:32.255 --> 00:58:35.225
It's gonna be hard to teach other people if you don't have

1291
00:58:35.225 --> 00:58:37.505
some measure of understanding for yourself.

1292
00:58:39.165 --> 00:58:39.385
Um,

1293
00:58:44.575 --> 00:58:45.505
Okay, I'll move on.

1294
00:58:46.165 --> 00:58:50.185
Um, theology empowers us to enjoy God number four

1295
00:58:51.085 --> 00:58:54.465
in greater ways, the Westminster Confession of Faith.

1296
00:58:54.945 --> 00:58:58.585
A famous, uh, historical statement of faith says

1297
00:58:58.585 --> 00:59:02.425
that she begins, the chief end of man is to glorify God

1298
00:59:02.885 --> 00:59:05.025
and to enjoy him forever.

1299
00:59:05.765 --> 00:59:08.585
And I love how John Piper turns this to say, the chief end

1300
00:59:08.585 --> 00:59:13.265
of man is to glorify God by enjoying him forever.

1301
00:59:13.845 --> 00:59:15.545
If you don't know who God is

1302
00:59:15.545 --> 00:59:17.345
and what he's like, it's gonna be real hard

1303
00:59:17.345 --> 00:59:19.425
to enjoy him for who he is.

1304
00:59:19.775 --> 00:59:21.605
It's kinda like somebody maybe you've studied,

1305
00:59:22.625 --> 00:59:23.965
but you've never actually been around.

1306
00:59:24.915 --> 00:59:27.845
It's, it is somebody you kind of know some facts about, uh,

1307
00:59:27.875 --> 00:59:30.605
kind of your, your, your baseball crush or,

1308
00:59:30.905 --> 00:59:32.645
or whoever it might be, you know, all the stats

1309
00:59:33.185 --> 00:59:35.245
versus like the person you're married to

1310
00:59:35.515 --> 00:59:36.565
that you know really well.

1311
00:59:36.665 --> 00:59:38.925
So, um, alright

1312
00:59:44.265 --> 00:59:46.125
Man, I'm behind time.

1313
00:59:48.775 --> 00:59:50.765
Lemme do this. What's that?

1314
00:59:52.065 --> 00:59:56.085
All right, so time again, gimme time, give 18. Okay.

1315
00:59:57.145 --> 01:00:01.885
Um, theology will be a foundation in suffering

1316
01:00:02.785 --> 01:00:04.925
as we understand what God's revealed about the world.

1317
01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:08.405
Think about James who said in chapter one, counter All joy,

1318
01:00:08.465 --> 01:00:09.725
my brothers all joy.

1319
01:00:10.255 --> 01:00:11.285
Think about it this way.

1320
01:00:11.595 --> 01:00:13.245
When you suffer trials of various kind,

1321
01:00:13.345 --> 01:00:16.525
or Joe who said, naked, I came from my mother's womb,

1322
01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:18.725
naked all apart, the Lord gave,

1323
01:00:18.725 --> 01:00:20.325
the Lord takes away, has taken away.

1324
01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:23.285
Blessed be the name of the Lord. Uh, James was martyred.

1325
01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:25.845
Joe famously suffered, and yet

1326
01:00:25.845 --> 01:00:28.565
because of their knowledge of God, both about him

1327
01:00:28.585 --> 01:00:30.445
and their experience with him kept them.

1328
01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:33.485
And in the midst of time, uh, trial and struggle.

1329
01:00:33.665 --> 01:00:35.005
So we worshiped through tears

1330
01:00:35.545 --> 01:00:38.605
and we're re we're rooted for the storms.

1331
01:00:38.605 --> 01:00:40.605
It's like the anchor to our soul up here.

1332
01:00:40.825 --> 01:00:42.285
The drift in the sea of the world,

1333
01:00:42.665 --> 01:00:44.845
the anchor is gonna be the truth of God's word.

1334
01:00:45.945 --> 01:00:47.765
Uh, theology unifies Christians.

1335
01:00:47.765 --> 01:00:50.085
Number six, it, uh, protects the church.

1336
01:00:50.085 --> 01:00:54.445
Number seven, um, you know, there's a lot

1337
01:00:54.445 --> 01:00:55.765
of competing ideas out there.

1338
01:00:55.765 --> 01:00:59.125
Liberal theology, which is sort of changes words

1339
01:00:59.305 --> 01:01:01.325
to mean things that they don't really mean.

1340
01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:03.365
Um, well, so like you,

1341
01:01:03.365 --> 01:01:05.365
the classic one is we believe in the resurrection.

1342
01:01:07.675 --> 01:01:10.165
Dang. It's like the trumpet. Yeah.

1343
01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:14.405
Okay, so remind me, what time is that morning? 20. 20.

1344
01:01:15.235 --> 01:01:16.365
Okay, I got five minutes.

1345
01:01:17.265 --> 01:01:20.085
Um, okay, so, uh,

1346
01:01:21.325 --> 01:01:23.165
I didn't know the train was gonna be going off,

1347
01:01:23.225 --> 01:01:24.285
but I'm good.

1348
01:01:24.465 --> 01:01:26.005
I'm good. I asked for this actually.

1349
01:01:26.545 --> 01:01:30.645
Uh, Okay.

1350
01:01:30.825 --> 01:01:33.805
Uh, causes, there's causes for error.

1351
01:01:34.235 --> 01:01:36.005
It's when we obscure misuse the Bible.

1352
01:01:36.505 --> 01:01:39.925
Uh, Satan said, did God really say this? We question that.

1353
01:01:40.645 --> 01:01:43.125
Personal sin actually stands in the way. Believe it or not.

1354
01:01:43.235 --> 01:01:46.085
Rightly understanding God's word can be affected

1355
01:01:46.225 --> 01:01:47.645
by your personal sin.

1356
01:01:48.145 --> 01:01:49.685
And I'm just pulling the finger like,

1357
01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:51.605
like I live this, right?

1358
01:01:51.705 --> 01:01:56.165
So in, in the struggles I have where I struggle in my life,

1359
01:01:56.165 --> 01:01:59.445
where I don't walk with God will in like, that,

1360
01:01:59.445 --> 01:02:01.845
can actually affect what we believe, you know?

1361
01:02:01.965 --> 01:02:03.525
'cause it's a man, I don't wanna believe this or,

1362
01:02:03.785 --> 01:02:07.125
or it causes me like Adam and E were running high, right?

1363
01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:09.085
And so it's, we, we walk in the light

1364
01:02:09.505 --> 01:02:12.165
and, um, anyway, so it can stand in our way.

1365
01:02:13.665 --> 01:02:17.485
Uh, number eight, theology assists us in sharing our faith,

1366
01:02:17.545 --> 01:02:19.525
as we've seen with non-Christians.

1367
01:02:19.585 --> 01:02:23.965
Uh, number nine, it spurs our sanctification and growth.

1368
01:02:24.905 --> 01:02:27.525
Um, number 10, it brings glory to God.

1369
01:02:27.525 --> 01:02:28.685
We've already talked about this.

1370
01:02:29.265 --> 01:02:33.285
Um, okay, so how do we study? How do we study theology?

1371
01:02:33.555 --> 01:02:34.805
When we do so with prayer?

1372
01:02:35.905 --> 01:02:39.485
We, we do so dependently, praying on to God would help us

1373
01:02:39.545 --> 01:02:42.485
and give us wisdom and insight, just like David,

1374
01:02:42.515 --> 01:02:43.885
like I quoted earlier, said,

1375
01:02:44.115 --> 01:02:46.485
open my eyes that I would see this.

1376
01:02:46.485 --> 01:02:48.205
So what David's acknowledging is

1377
01:02:48.205 --> 01:02:50.005
that it's like his eyes are closed.

1378
01:02:50.275 --> 01:02:52.565
There's things he doesn't see, that he doesn't like,

1379
01:02:52.675 --> 01:02:53.925
that he doesn't understand.

1380
01:02:54.225 --> 01:02:56.285
And he's asking God, in my blindness

1381
01:02:56.625 --> 01:02:59.845
or in my willfully closed eyes to who you are,

1382
01:02:59.845 --> 01:03:01.645
would you please open my eyes?

1383
01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:04.605
Would you help me to see something that I don't?

1384
01:03:05.025 --> 01:03:08.205
And, uh, and so we pray, we pray that God would help us and,

1385
01:03:08.345 --> 01:03:10.805
and, and help overcome all of our limitations.

1386
01:03:11.225 --> 01:03:14.005
Uh, as I said earlier, we do so with humility.

1387
01:03:14.785 --> 01:03:18.525
And, um, and humility is, uh, the,

1388
01:03:18.525 --> 01:03:21.125
the Bible says in multiple places, God

1389
01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.605
actively opposes the proud.

1390
01:03:24.305 --> 01:03:27.595
And he gives grace to who? Humble.

1391
01:03:27.895 --> 01:03:28.955
He gives grace to the humble.

1392
01:03:29.175 --> 01:03:32.435
So we wanna walk into humility and dependence on God.

1393
01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:36.155
Uh, so generally speaking, it's sort of like

1394
01:03:36.155 --> 01:03:37.235
what we've talked about already.

1395
01:03:37.895 --> 01:03:40.875
Um, three different levels at which we should hold

1396
01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:42.075
certain theological beliefs.

1397
01:03:42.495 --> 01:03:46.515
Uh, there's convictions, persuasions, and opinions. Okay?

1398
01:03:46.515 --> 01:03:49.035
There's top tier enc, closed handed issues.

1399
01:03:49.145 --> 01:03:51.195
This is kind of back, I should have put this back in the

1400
01:03:51.195 --> 01:03:53.755
other convictions, persuasions and opinions.

1401
01:03:54.175 --> 01:03:57.475
Um, sometimes we're real excited about our opinions

1402
01:03:58.295 --> 01:03:59.955
and we're actually confused.

1403
01:04:00.495 --> 01:04:04.565
Or it's actually, just so you know, it, there's,

1404
01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:06.285
it's not wrong to have like an opinion

1405
01:04:06.935 --> 01:04:08.485
about something that's unclear.

1406
01:04:09.005 --> 01:04:11.765
I got all kinds of opinions. Like even do you see this?

1407
01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:13.965
Do you see Paul do this? I think it's the first Corinthians.

1408
01:04:14.275 --> 01:04:15.645
He's talking about celibacy

1409
01:04:15.665 --> 01:04:20.285
and he says, Hey, in my opinion, that's the best thing.

1410
01:04:20.525 --> 01:04:22.245
'cause I mean, look at all the ministry I can do,

1411
01:04:22.985 --> 01:04:24.685
but he doesn't say, he says, that's me.

1412
01:04:24.685 --> 01:04:25.925
That's not the Lord, you know?

1413
01:04:26.265 --> 01:04:30.165
Um, okay, uh, I will

1414
01:04:31.515 --> 01:04:34.005
send you the rest of the answers here.

1415
01:04:34.005 --> 01:04:38.085
What's the top 2, 3, 2, 3. Oh, I got two minutes.

1416
01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:41.565
Number three is reason and logic or reason.

1417
01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:44.245
We wanna be, uh, we study with reason and logic.

1418
01:04:44.375 --> 01:04:46.205
We're thoughtful, like we've talked about.

1419
01:04:46.585 --> 01:04:50.605
We wanna do with other Christians, um, with, with the help

1420
01:04:50.605 --> 01:04:53.205
of Christians throughout church history, as we've seen

1421
01:04:53.505 --> 01:04:57.205
by collecting and understanding all the relevant passages in

1422
01:04:57.205 --> 01:05:00.005
the Bible, not just kind of cherry, cherry picking the ones

1423
01:05:00.005 --> 01:05:01.285
that seem to apply.

1424
01:05:01.545 --> 01:05:03.245
Number seven, we're rejoicing.

1425
01:05:03.545 --> 01:05:06.605
We, we do so with rejoicing and praise

1426
01:05:06.745 --> 01:05:08.765
and this is where I wanna land the plane.

1427
01:05:08.915 --> 01:05:12.045
Okay? Would somebody in your Bible please read Psalm

1428
01:05:12.065 --> 01:05:15.245
1 19, 1 62,

1429
01:05:16.175 --> 01:05:16.525
Psalm

1430
01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:21.545
1 19, 1 62 44

1431
01:05:26.035 --> 01:05:26.325
what?

1432
01:05:26.825 --> 01:05:29.485
24 minutes. Oh, oh, for real.

1433
01:05:30.465 --> 01:05:34.405
Oh, okay, well go for it. What was

1434
01:05:34.405 --> 01:05:35.085
It? Psalm one 16,

1435
01:05:35.495 --> 01:05:39.765
Psalm one nineteen, one hundred and sixty two.

1436
01:05:40.105 --> 01:05:41.765
If I wrote this down correctly,

1437
01:05:43.125 --> 01:05:45.485
I rejoice your word like one dup finds

1438
01:05:45.485 --> 01:05:46.485
Great spoil.

1439
01:05:47.555 --> 01:05:48.725
Okay, great spoil.

1440
01:05:49.635 --> 01:05:51.125
Mike, would you be happy if you felt

1441
01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:52.325
like this huge treasure?

1442
01:05:54.085 --> 01:05:56.005
Anybody? Okay.

1443
01:05:56.405 --> 01:05:57.925
I would, I mean, Elise,

1444
01:05:58.105 --> 01:06:01.285
but if I knew nobody was gonna claim it, uh, it's awesome.

1445
01:06:01.955 --> 01:06:05.405
Okay, so in God's word, you have found a great spoil. Okay?

1446
01:06:05.985 --> 01:06:10.725
Um, JJI Packer, he says, theology is doxology.

1447
01:06:11.425 --> 01:06:13.005
And this is where just I want to end here.

1448
01:06:13.005 --> 01:06:15.085
He says, uh, it's the idea

1449
01:06:15.715 --> 01:06:17.925
that we don't wanna just be informed about God.

1450
01:06:17.945 --> 01:06:19.925
We wanna be transformed in our lives.

1451
01:06:20.305 --> 01:06:22.525
We want to not only know about God, we want to know him

1452
01:06:22.905 --> 01:06:26.085
and theology and doxology, like you see this in Romans 11

1453
01:06:26.085 --> 01:06:28.325
and wrote it in there, Paul, but talking about theology.

1454
01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:32.005
And he ends with this huge crescendo of praise.

1455
01:06:32.465 --> 01:06:34.605
And he says, oh, the depths of the riches

1456
01:06:34.605 --> 01:06:38.205
and wisdom of God, he just begins to respond to God's word.

1457
01:06:38.205 --> 01:06:40.205
So here's what I wanna do, and we won't do it every night,

1458
01:06:40.845 --> 01:06:43.165
probably maybe, but uh, I want to end with a song.

1459
01:06:43.185 --> 01:06:44.805
If you guys, uh, if we're up, up,

1460
01:06:44.825 --> 01:06:46.365
out on time, you can go if you got to.

1461
01:06:46.705 --> 01:06:49.525
But ask Nick to, uh, to lead us in a song.

1462
01:06:50.275 --> 01:06:51.565
Make sure you signed up.

1463
01:06:52.625 --> 01:06:54.205
The sheets are up here on that table.

1464
01:06:56.265 --> 01:06:57.485
It maybe a song, you know,

1465
01:06:57.785 --> 01:06:59.245
if you guys wanna pass this around.

1466
01:07:03.425 --> 01:07:06.045
And so, uh, I just want, I asked Nick to, uh,

1467
01:07:06.045 --> 01:07:09.525
to lead us in the song is this, uh, you may know it.

1468
01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:13.365
It's called Behold Our God in, uh, Isaiah 40 is

1469
01:07:13.365 --> 01:07:14.565
what the Prophet said, he said,

1470
01:07:14.585 --> 01:07:16.525
or the Lord said, get up on a high mountain

1471
01:07:16.985 --> 01:07:20.085
and say to my people, say, behold your God.

1472
01:07:20.545 --> 01:07:22.525
And what he meant by that is like, we ought to look long

1473
01:07:22.525 --> 01:07:25.565
and hard at the beauty and the glory of God.

1474
01:07:25.945 --> 01:07:28.085
And that's our goal. And so we wanna send you so

1475
01:07:48.585 --> 01:07:49.645
The ocean

1476
01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:09.965
rises to

1477
01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:55.885
the

1478
01:08:55.955 --> 01:08:56.955
Lord.

1479
01:08:58.745 --> 01:08:58.965
Can

1480
01:10:26.605 --> 01:10:26.825
God

1481
01:11:50.275 --> 01:11:50.815
One more time

1482
01:12:00.355 --> 01:12:01.375
seated on

1483
01:12:14.595 --> 01:12:15.695
Can Compare.

1484
01:12:17.205 --> 01:12:19.335
Come let us adore

1485
01:12:24.485 --> 01:12:25.485
Mighty God. We thank

1486
01:12:25.485 --> 01:12:28.385
you for tonight. We thank you for meeting with us.

1487
01:12:28.775 --> 01:12:32.585
Even as we sing these songs, as we begin to just

1488
01:12:33.485 --> 01:12:35.865
ly think your thoughts and consider you

1489
01:12:35.965 --> 01:12:38.865
and bask in the glory of who you are.

1490
01:12:39.145 --> 01:12:41.145
I pray that you would help us to do that in truth

1491
01:12:41.145 --> 01:12:43.865
that in our minds and in our hearts

1492
01:12:43.865 --> 01:12:46.025
and in our lives, that we would know you

1493
01:12:46.365 --> 01:12:47.985
and that we'd be changed by you.

1494
01:12:47.985 --> 01:12:50.745
And we reflect that rightly into the world.

1495
01:12:50.805 --> 01:12:53.225
God, we love you and we thank you in Jesus name. Amen.

1496
01:12:53.975 --> 01:12:55.585
Alright, thank you. Time's

1497
01:12:55.585 --> 01:12:56.585
Up.

1498
01:12:58.005 --> 01:13:01.265
Oh, if you have it, please sign up. Thank you Nick.

1499
01:13:02.285 --> 01:13:05.745
Be my friend. Mark. That's right. Oh, hey.

so it's like

1509
01:16:42.145 --> 01:16:42.685
the problem.

1510
01:16:53.345 --> 01:16:53.565
So
