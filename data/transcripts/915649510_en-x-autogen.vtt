1
00:00:00.335 --> 00:00:00.635
All right.

2
00:00:01.345 --> 00:00:04.475
That is the shift to where we start, I guess now.

3
00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:06.955
All right, well, so welcome.

4
00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:10.035
Good to see you tonight on this Wednesday, digging deeper,

5
00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:13.755
and, uh, hope you had some good chicken enchilada Cas oil.

6
00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:17.035
So good. Um, so tonight should be fun.

7
00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:20.715
This'll be an interesting one of all of them.

8
00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.475
This is probably the most debated

9
00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.875
of all the subjects we've studied so far,

10
00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:29.955
because there are wildly divergent views on this.

11
00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:31.035
And we'll talk through some

12
00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:32.755
of those tonight as we dig deeper.

13
00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:36.275
Uh, but you know, I love Charles Spurgeon,

14
00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:40.355
and so I wanted to start with a quote just to kind of color

15
00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:44.995
our evening and really our thoughts on it about really

16
00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:50.195
why we, we do talk about it, of course, and we should.

17
00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.315
But, um, why we don't talk about it all the time.

18
00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:55.435
And so let me give you this quote.

19
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.915
Spurgeon said, I think some ministers would do far more

20
00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.675
for the prophet of God's people

21
00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:04.155
if they would preach more about the first advent

22
00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:05.235
and less about the second.

23
00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:08.315
So the idea is that we,

24
00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.835
we should prioritize the first coming of Christ

25
00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:14.435
and what that meant for his people and for us.

26
00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:17.195
But also we can't ignore it.

27
00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:19.555
The second coming, the second advent,

28
00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:21.155
that word advent is appearing.

29
00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:22.555
So we can't ignore it.

30
00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.315
And so that's why we've made it one of the big rocks, is

31
00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:27.155
'cause it is a part of our faith

32
00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:28.995
and it's an essential part of our faith.

33
00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:33.455
And so we have to hold up what is essential

34
00:01:33.915 --> 00:01:37.775
and what is less or non-essential in that.

35
00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:39.055
Now, I said these things on Sunday,

36
00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:40.975
I'm gonna say 'em again just to preface our time.

37
00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.215
I cannot, we cannot answer every question you have.

38
00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:49.375
Uh, we could spend years in this room doing that.

39
00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:53.375
And so we can't answer every one of those. That's okay.

40
00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:56.495
Uh, because there are some we will not know the answer to

41
00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:57.695
until it actually happens,

42
00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:03.455
and we won't be able to fully nuance and every detail

43
00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:05.375
and everything that you would think

44
00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:08.015
or I would think is the the most important issue.

45
00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:10.015
We just can't dig into all of those.

46
00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:13.455
Uh, and, and really that's okay again,

47
00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:16.135
because there's elements of this that we need

48
00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:20.015
to see are important and essential.

49
00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:23.335
But we also need to understand there's stuff that is

50
00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:27.495
third level, third tier issues that we can disagree on

51
00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:32.235
and still be in the same small group, the same church.

52
00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:36.395
And we can dis differ and disagree, and that's okay.

53
00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:39.635
But there are the elements that I said on Sunday

54
00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:43.075
that we can't deny and still call ourselves Christian.

55
00:02:43.855 --> 00:02:45.115
So there's an essential piece,

56
00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:47.755
and we're gonna talk about those things that are more,

57
00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:49.795
salvific is the word we use.

58
00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:52.795
The the saving first tier issues that we talk about.

59
00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:54.595
Uh, those are things

60
00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:57.355
that we're gonna quickly touch on again, uh,

61
00:02:57.415 --> 00:02:59.365
but we're gonna get to some

62
00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:01.085
of those third tier issues tonight and,

63
00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:02.645
and talk about the differences there.

64
00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:04.165
But I want to ask this question.

65
00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:09.035
Isn't it interesting that Jesus coming back

66
00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:11.555
for his bride, which in

67
00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:14.275
so doing will unify us all together?

68
00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:16.235
And this is the universal church.

69
00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:17.635
I'll talk about this Sunday a little bit.

70
00:03:18.335 --> 00:03:20.475
All believers from all times

71
00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:24.395
and all around the world, God,

72
00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:26.835
in his redemption

73
00:03:26.835 --> 00:03:29.675
and Reese constitution of everything will

74
00:03:30.405 --> 00:03:32.115
unify us all together.

75
00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:37.275
Jesus, coming back for that bride to unify us is actually

76
00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:38.755
what often divides us.

77
00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:43.515
We become more evangelistic about these third tier,

78
00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.675
these third level issues than we are

79
00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:49.995
about the one body being taken home to be with him forever.

80
00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:54.155
Like that should be our primary task, our primary focus,

81
00:03:54.175 --> 00:03:57.355
our primary energy should be spent on that

82
00:03:58.935 --> 00:04:00.195
rather than these other things.

83
00:04:00.225 --> 00:04:02.435
This should not be a dividing point for us.

84
00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:04.395
It should be a unifying point for us.

85
00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:05.875
These things that are essential.

86
00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:08.715
So we went through Matthew 25 on Sunday

87
00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:12.995
and looked at, it's it's main big rock items, right?

88
00:04:12.995 --> 00:04:15.595
And so we saw things like Jesus is the one who's going

89
00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:17.275
to return simple truth.

90
00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:19.435
We know that coming in his glory,

91
00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:21.875
which means he's gonna come visibly, uh,

92
00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:24.195
the debate will be win, but we'll talk about that later.

93
00:04:25.095 --> 00:04:26.715
And he's going to come to judge.

94
00:04:27.615 --> 00:04:29.955
So he's not coming back just to hang out

95
00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:31.235
with, uh, people on earth.

96
00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:32.555
He's coming back to judge

97
00:04:32.575 --> 00:04:34.315
and separate the sheep and the goats.

98
00:04:34.335 --> 00:04:36.915
And there's even debate about how many judgments there are

99
00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:37.995
and when those judgments happen.

100
00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:39.595
And so we'll get into some of that too.

101
00:04:39.615 --> 00:04:42.075
But, but you can begin to see how, okay,

102
00:04:42.075 --> 00:04:45.715
even just the basic truths we get all over the place

103
00:04:46.225 --> 00:04:47.595
when we have to apply those and,

104
00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:50.355
and figure out the, the nuance and details of those.

105
00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:52.795
But he is coming back to judge. We know that's true.

106
00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:56.515
Uh, and he's coming back to judge so

107
00:04:56.515 --> 00:04:58.355
that some will go to eternal life.

108
00:04:58.905 --> 00:05:01.275
Some will go to eternal punishment.

109
00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:03.195
And that's eternal life is God's kingdom.

110
00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:07.235
Uh, his blessing, joy, eternal face-to-face with God.

111
00:05:07.235 --> 00:05:08.275
That's the best part about it.

112
00:05:08.795 --> 00:05:10.795
I asked the question, what if you could have all

113
00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:14.355
that heaven would give you, yet Jesus wasn't there?

114
00:05:14.365 --> 00:05:15.475
Would you still take it?

115
00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:18.715
Well, it's maybe just about what I'm getting out of it,

116
00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:20.355
instead of being in relationship with God,

117
00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:21.635
which is the most important piece.

118
00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:25.235
So don't miss that. That's the eternal life that begins now.

119
00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:29.235
We're made alive in Christ. We have eternal life even now.

120
00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.435
Uh, but that will one day be fully

121
00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:35.075
and finally eternally given in that life.

122
00:05:36.105 --> 00:05:38.205
But then the eternal punishment's, the other side of that,

123
00:05:38.395 --> 00:05:41.965
that some will be, uh, raised to, to, to life

124
00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:46.165
eternal punished in that, that's where the goats ended up.

125
00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:49.365
He called it eternal fire. Uh, there's no way around that.

126
00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:50.725
That's a literal fire.

127
00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:53.845
Literal hell with an unquenchable flame.

128
00:05:54.585 --> 00:05:57.005
Um, some deny hell, of course, but,

129
00:05:57.345 --> 00:05:59.725
but we can't use it as some kind of symbolism

130
00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:03.125
because it stands for something worse than that then, which,

131
00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:05.205
that's what is worse.

132
00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:08.125
And how would you even want that to be worse than that?

133
00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:12.565
It's for the devil pit cursing the fire.

134
00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:14.605
It's what God's word over and over throughout scripture

135
00:06:14.755 --> 00:06:18.605
says, a variety of things about that I wanted to read.

136
00:06:19.185 --> 00:06:20.965
So thinking about those essentials,

137
00:06:20.965 --> 00:06:25.845
those big rock items I wanted to read, um, what our,

138
00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:29.685
our statement of beliefs on our website says about the last

139
00:06:29.685 --> 00:06:32.125
things, just to kind of give you a summary of what, uh, we

140
00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.805
as elders have come up with, says,

141
00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:37.645
the earth will not exist in its current form forever.

142
00:06:39.155 --> 00:06:40.295
Big changes are coming.

143
00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:43.535
Everybody lives forever after they die.

144
00:06:44.145 --> 00:06:46.375
Christians will go to heaven to live with God.

145
00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:48.935
And non-Christians will go to hell to live forever

146
00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:50.815
separated from God.

147
00:06:52.685 --> 00:06:56.555
Jesus now sits on a throne in heaven beside God the Father.

148
00:06:58.525 --> 00:06:59.945
That's the second one tonight, right?

149
00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:03.105
Um, Jesus now sits on a throne in heaven

150
00:07:03.105 --> 00:07:04.145
beside God the Father,

151
00:07:04.905 --> 00:07:08.785
although no one knows what day it will be, Jesus will return

152
00:07:08.805 --> 00:07:12.345
to earth in power and glory to judge all people

153
00:07:12.845 --> 00:07:14.305
and to make all things new,

154
00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:17.915
simple, right?

155
00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:20.235
Just basic big rock stuff.

156
00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:23.195
That's what we would stand on.

157
00:07:23.335 --> 00:07:24.795
And, and those are the things

158
00:07:24.905 --> 00:07:28.195
that would make this distinctly Christian.

159
00:07:29.235 --> 00:07:31.755
A lot of the other things we start debating on are,

160
00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:35.515
are Christian, but, but they're not the essentials, right?

161
00:07:35.575 --> 00:07:38.115
We can differ on those. This is the core.

162
00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:41.395
Those are the things that we must believe

163
00:07:42.175 --> 00:07:44.715
or we can't really call ourselves Christian

164
00:07:44.775 --> 00:07:45.835
in our belief system.

165
00:07:47.855 --> 00:07:50.105
Then what we don't know, it's mentioned in there, is

166
00:07:50.105 --> 00:07:53.585
what we don't know is when Jesus will return win.

167
00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:57.825
And in many ways, some of the patterns of order

168
00:07:57.845 --> 00:08:00.585
of operation, how we'll talk about that a little bit,

169
00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:03.665
but this is what divides us so often is when

170
00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:05.505
will Jesus come back?

171
00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:08.745
And many people have, have predicted that Nostradamus,

172
00:08:09.145 --> 00:08:10.865
I don't even know who that guy is,

173
00:08:11.085 --> 00:08:13.865
but I see his name on the thing right

174
00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:15.985
by the supermarket checkout stand all the time.

175
00:08:16.005 --> 00:08:18.105
And he's always predicting when the world's gonna end.

176
00:08:19.655 --> 00:08:21.385
Well, we don't know.

177
00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:25.345
And anybody who says they know are lying

178
00:08:27.045 --> 00:08:28.995
cults throughout history have used that

179
00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:34.785
whatever date they came up with as a way to say, you need

180
00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:37.905
to follow me or us because we have this way

181
00:08:37.965 --> 00:08:39.065
and we know when it's coming.

182
00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:40.665
And so we can prepare for it.

183
00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:44.665
That's a dangerous place to be. Jesus himself said that.

184
00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:47.025
Don't somebody's gonna say, look here,

185
00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:48.145
it's coming here, it's coming.

186
00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:49.985
And Jesus said, don't. No, no, don't listen to 'em.

187
00:08:50.555 --> 00:08:51.905
Don't listen, because they don't know.

188
00:08:52.645 --> 00:08:54.825
We can think we have some signs of things,

189
00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:56.045
but, but really we don't.

190
00:08:56.345 --> 00:08:57.965
And so what happens then?

191
00:08:57.965 --> 00:09:01.285
I, I said this Sunday, is that when we start

192
00:09:01.425 --> 00:09:04.365
to think about those hints, and he says, wars

193
00:09:04.365 --> 00:09:05.725
and rumors of wars and earthquakes

194
00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:08.405
and, uh, the, the gospel going to all nations,

195
00:09:08.405 --> 00:09:10.685
there's all those kind of hints that we think, okay,

196
00:09:10.685 --> 00:09:12.245
we can identify when and where,

197
00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:14.165
and well, this is who that person is.

198
00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:16.325
The problem is Jesus never intended for us to do that.

199
00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:20.085
That this pope is the antichrist, we're certain about it.

200
00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:22.645
Well, then he dies and we're like, well, maybe not.

201
00:09:22.945 --> 00:09:26.445
Um, that nation is Babylon, right? It's gotta be.

202
00:09:26.635 --> 00:09:28.445
Well, it turned out they weren't.

203
00:09:28.545 --> 00:09:33.125
So we can't get so dogmatic fixed on

204
00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:34.245
what we would say this

205
00:09:34.305 --> 00:09:36.405
or that is this specific thing in Revelation.

206
00:09:36.465 --> 00:09:39.085
And and in this part of Ezekiel, it says this,

207
00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:41.525
and we need to be really cautious.

208
00:09:41.595 --> 00:09:42.765
It's okay to believe

209
00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:44.805
and to think through those things, absolutely.

210
00:09:45.225 --> 00:09:48.125
But just be careful in making such dogmatic statements.

211
00:09:48.285 --> 00:09:49.685
'cause he never intended for us to do that.

212
00:09:50.345 --> 00:09:53.285
The nature of apocalyptic literature is that it's difficult

213
00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:55.285
to understand and there's ways

214
00:09:55.285 --> 00:09:56.565
to interpret it very differently.

215
00:09:57.265 --> 00:09:59.405
So we need to be careful with that.

216
00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:01.775
Uh, I gave that joke and,

217
00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:03.255
and even Steve a second ago gave

218
00:10:03.255 --> 00:10:05.415
that joke about, are you pan?

219
00:10:05.475 --> 00:10:07.575
Are, are you pre-millennial? Are you post-millennial?

220
00:10:07.575 --> 00:10:08.935
Are you all millennial? We'll see all

221
00:10:08.935 --> 00:10:09.975
those things here in a second.

222
00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:11.735
Well, this guy said, I'm pan millennial.

223
00:10:11.735 --> 00:10:13.775
It's all gonna pan out in the end. That's true.

224
00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:19.175
We can't use it as an excuse not to really work at believing

225
00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:21.055
and understanding these things.

226
00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:23.895
But it is the truth

227
00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:28.855
that it will pan out in the end how God wanted it to.

228
00:10:29.835 --> 00:10:31.415
We know he is promised to return.

229
00:10:31.515 --> 00:10:34.975
So our job is to stay awake, all the parables, stay alert,

230
00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:39.015
stay ready, keep the lamps lighted, all of that.

231
00:10:40.045 --> 00:10:42.345
And the reason he hasn't told us is

232
00:10:42.345 --> 00:10:44.345
because then we'd start just living loose

233
00:10:44.605 --> 00:10:46.185
and we'd say, well, we know the date.

234
00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:48.745
We already know the time. So I can do kinda whatever

235
00:10:48.745 --> 00:10:49.825
I want till that week ahead.

236
00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:51.745
Then I really need to clear some stuff up

237
00:10:51.765 --> 00:10:52.865
before he comes back.

238
00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:54.985
And it just defeats the whole purpose.

239
00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:57.305
So he hasn't told us so

240
00:10:57.305 --> 00:10:59.465
that we can just stay ready all the time.

241
00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:02.025
So what do we do with it? Of course,

242
00:11:02.105 --> 00:11:03.225
I said, there's, there's four things.

243
00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:05.185
There's more, of course, there's just four things.

244
00:11:06.045 --> 00:11:09.385
Uh, what we do with all this is not just debate it,

245
00:11:09.965 --> 00:11:11.705
but we live in response.

246
00:11:11.715 --> 00:11:13.865
First, we believe wholeheartedly.

247
00:11:14.525 --> 00:11:18.225
Um, and that was that idea that it's not works-based.

248
00:11:18.575 --> 00:11:22.445
It's that God has done what he's done

249
00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:24.765
for us in salvation.

250
00:11:24.945 --> 00:11:26.165
Our job is to believe.

251
00:11:27.105 --> 00:11:31.165
And so Ephesians two, Romans 10

252
00:11:31.695 --> 00:11:34.085
talks about that, that that's the crux

253
00:11:34.145 --> 00:11:35.725
of the matter, is belief.

254
00:11:35.985 --> 00:11:39.565
And then what happens from there is of course

255
00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:41.205
that the life is transformed.

256
00:11:41.205 --> 00:11:43.005
Ephesians two 10 continues

257
00:11:43.005 --> 00:11:44.085
that these good works, he's prepared.

258
00:11:44.085 --> 00:11:47.245
That's what our lives then look like, is

259
00:11:47.245 --> 00:11:48.565
what he says in Matthew 25.

260
00:11:48.565 --> 00:11:49.925
That changes happen.

261
00:11:51.535 --> 00:11:55.205
So, and I, I said this, I wanna say it again.

262
00:11:55.275 --> 00:11:56.805
Virtually every time

263
00:11:57.665 --> 00:12:00.285
the New Testament talks about the return of Christ,

264
00:12:01.065 --> 00:12:03.605
it is immediately followed by an exhortation

265
00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:05.085
to godliness and holy living.

266
00:12:06.545 --> 00:12:09.005
So if it happens that often, even the book

267
00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:13.925
of Revelation says, keep this, not just like hold it,

268
00:12:14.155 --> 00:12:15.325
keep it, obey it.

269
00:12:16.815 --> 00:12:18.865
Live a life of righteousness.

270
00:12:20.545 --> 00:12:22.605
If that's always coupled together,

271
00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:24.405
then we should identify that.

272
00:12:24.405 --> 00:12:25.925
That's one of the reasons He tells us

273
00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:29.925
that this end is coming, is to prompt us

274
00:12:30.585 --> 00:12:31.725
to live lives.

275
00:12:32.195 --> 00:12:35.645
That would reflect we're waiting on our king to come back.

276
00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:39.565
That's what our job should be. We've missed the whole point.

277
00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:43.965
If that study of the end times doesn't conform us more

278
00:12:43.965 --> 00:12:48.625
to Jesus in our lives, we also talked about going

279
00:12:48.815 --> 00:12:50.145
that because of this.

280
00:12:50.775 --> 00:12:54.385
Like, I know I got eternal life so I can risk,

281
00:12:55.565 --> 00:12:57.865
uh, we can't miss evangelism.

282
00:12:57.865 --> 00:12:59.225
That Spurgeon quote again of,

283
00:12:59.265 --> 00:13:00.985
I deeply regret when I see persons

284
00:13:00.985 --> 00:13:02.105
so taken up with prophecy.

285
00:13:02.105 --> 00:13:04.505
They forget evangelism, trumpets

286
00:13:04.505 --> 00:13:07.385
and bowls must not displace the gospel in its invitations.

287
00:13:07.415 --> 00:13:08.945
Like this is the point.

288
00:13:10.215 --> 00:13:11.805
Let's not just sit here and debate all these things,

289
00:13:11.825 --> 00:13:16.045
but the gospel going forth is what he's called us to.

290
00:13:16.105 --> 00:13:18.565
And it's scary. But risk is fine

291
00:13:18.925 --> 00:13:21.645
whenever we know that there's hope on the other side of it.

292
00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:24.125
So we can take risks, know that God's got us.

293
00:13:25.145 --> 00:13:27.205
But then the last point was, wait, expectantly,

294
00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:30.565
that there's a measure of of not knowing when,

295
00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:35.205
but as we wait doesn't mean just kind of sit back

296
00:13:35.265 --> 00:13:36.525
and passively wait.

297
00:13:37.035 --> 00:13:39.165
It's wait with an expectancy.

298
00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:42.965
And that's that long Campbell Morgan quote that,

299
00:13:43.105 --> 00:13:45.605
uh, it's dark.

300
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.565
We know it is. Yes, but it was dark in Rome.

301
00:13:49.465 --> 00:13:53.485
It was really bad back then in various times and ways.

302
00:13:54.745 --> 00:13:55.885
And so we could lament

303
00:13:56.785 --> 00:13:58.685
or we could be like the New Testament church,

304
00:13:58.975 --> 00:14:01.005
which lived in this spirit of triumph,

305
00:14:02.355 --> 00:14:04.445
that there's a note of victory.

306
00:14:05.175 --> 00:14:08.565
Everything we see throughout the New Testament,

307
00:14:08.565 --> 00:14:10.085
think again, look again, judge.

308
00:14:10.145 --> 00:14:12.365
Not by the circumstances of the passing hour,

309
00:14:12.425 --> 00:14:15.445
but by the infinite things of our gospel and our God.

310
00:14:18.705 --> 00:14:20.885
He says it earlier, I kind of, I went quickly through it.

311
00:14:20.885 --> 00:14:25.705
I, I, if ever I'm tempted to think

312
00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:29.025
that religion is almost dead today, it's when I listen

313
00:14:29.085 --> 00:14:30.545
to the wailing of some Christian

314
00:14:30.545 --> 00:14:34.265
people, I think we get there.

315
00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:38.945
We as a church, as Christians in a, a world like we live,

316
00:14:39.115 --> 00:14:42.745
where you keep hearing these news stories about

317
00:14:42.745 --> 00:14:44.465
how dark everything is, how bad everything is,

318
00:14:44.465 --> 00:14:45.705
and we just start lamenting.

319
00:14:45.705 --> 00:14:49.185
And we start talking. Woe is us. Look how bad this is.

320
00:14:49.245 --> 00:14:51.645
Why is our life so hard? Why is our nation so bad?

321
00:14:51.745 --> 00:14:53.685
Why is the world so fallen? All these things.

322
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:56.325
If ever I'm tempted to think

323
00:14:56.325 --> 00:14:57.645
that religion is almost dead today.

324
00:14:57.645 --> 00:14:58.885
It's when I listen to the wailing

325
00:14:58.885 --> 00:15:02.835
of some Christian people, that's the truth.

326
00:15:03.095 --> 00:15:06.875
We, we should of all people have a note of triumph

327
00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:09.235
because we know the end of the story.

328
00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:11.955
We know that this is not it.

329
00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:15.455
We get the opportunity on the backside of this

330
00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:18.735
to have life forever with God.

331
00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:23.745
Great, great, great news, right?

332
00:15:25.255 --> 00:15:29.395
So let that filter into today.

333
00:15:30.435 --> 00:15:34.965
When we look around and yes, we don't enjoy sin

334
00:15:34.965 --> 00:15:37.845
around us, darkness in our families, we don't enjoy that.

335
00:15:38.785 --> 00:15:43.605
But let the hope filter the way we see today.

336
00:15:44.075 --> 00:15:46.605
Wait for the Lord, be strong. Let your heart take courage.

337
00:15:47.235 --> 00:15:48.325
Wait for the Lord.

338
00:15:50.965 --> 00:15:52.925
I think one of the phrases you often hear

339
00:15:53.515 --> 00:15:54.925
when things are really hard, we say,

340
00:15:54.925 --> 00:15:55.965
come quickly, Lord Jesus.

341
00:15:56.695 --> 00:15:58.365
Right? Don't we say that? You hear that?

342
00:15:58.365 --> 00:16:00.245
Say, come quickly, Lord Jesus, even at the end

343
00:16:00.245 --> 00:16:02.285
of Revelation 22, we get that it's true.

344
00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:07.865
But man, we say that only the times when it's hard,

345
00:16:10.055 --> 00:16:13.025
come quickly, Lord Jesus, get me out of my suffering.

346
00:16:16.395 --> 00:16:19.085
Shouldn't this be the joy of our lives?

347
00:16:20.465 --> 00:16:23.835
That, that we get not only new heavens

348
00:16:23.835 --> 00:16:25.875
and new earth, no pain, no suffering, no sin.

349
00:16:26.215 --> 00:16:28.755
We get that come quickly, Lord Jesus. Yes.

350
00:16:29.735 --> 00:16:32.035
But we get to see our Lord face to face.

351
00:16:34.665 --> 00:16:37.405
So even if, even if things are really good

352
00:16:38.105 --> 00:16:41.005
in our lives right now, come quickly, Lord Jesus.

353
00:16:41.365 --> 00:16:44.315
'cause I wanna see you. That's what I want.

354
00:16:44.315 --> 00:16:46.115
That's what I long for above all else.

355
00:16:46.455 --> 00:16:49.715
One thing I desire, dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

356
00:16:50.045 --> 00:16:53.765
Psalm says, so come quickly, Lord Jesus,

357
00:16:54.185 --> 00:16:58.035
not just when everything's falling apart, come quickly.

358
00:16:58.065 --> 00:17:02.795
Lord Jesus, all day, every day. Vance Havner said it.

359
00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.595
The early believers were not looking

360
00:17:04.695 --> 00:17:05.915
for something to happen.

361
00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.795
They were looking for someone to come.

362
00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:14.345
Looking for the train to arrive is one thing,

363
00:17:14.965 --> 00:17:17.865
but looking for someone, we love to come on

364
00:17:17.865 --> 00:17:21.405
that train is another matter, right?

365
00:17:21.405 --> 00:17:25.245
So let's be expectant waiting that

366
00:17:25.965 --> 00:17:27.745
our king is coming on that train.

367
00:17:29.195 --> 00:17:31.335
Not just to make everything better for us,

368
00:17:31.955 --> 00:17:33.015
but our king is coming.

369
00:17:33.715 --> 00:17:36.935
That's the goal. Alright?

370
00:17:37.075 --> 00:17:41.135
So we're gonna dig into now a little bit of

371
00:17:41.995 --> 00:17:45.295
the how do we interpret the book of Revelation?

372
00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.845
That's the, so we're getting into the third level stuff now.

373
00:17:48.945 --> 00:17:50.125
Now, right? The sand.

374
00:17:50.955 --> 00:17:53.405
This is where we can differ on some, some things.

375
00:17:53.465 --> 00:17:55.805
And, and it's okay. We can have debates and questions

376
00:17:55.805 --> 00:17:57.125
and talk differently about it.

377
00:17:57.185 --> 00:17:59.685
Yes. How do we interpret the book of Revelation?

378
00:17:59.685 --> 00:18:02.245
Well, here's, here's one quote, one statement.

379
00:18:03.105 --> 00:18:07.405
It cannot mean to us what it did not mean to them.

380
00:18:10.015 --> 00:18:12.355
Here's what that means. It cannot mean to us

381
00:18:13.345 --> 00:18:14.755
what it did not mean to them.

382
00:18:16.575 --> 00:18:19.755
So that's kinda the idea we're getting to with, okay,

383
00:18:19.755 --> 00:18:21.315
we're trying to pinpoint history.

384
00:18:21.365 --> 00:18:26.285
Who's this? Who's that? They had no idea Russia

385
00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:29.535
would exist 2000 years ago.

386
00:18:31.975 --> 00:18:34.515
So it can't mean to us what it never meant to them,

387
00:18:35.575 --> 00:18:38.825
what it would not have meant or did not mean to them.

388
00:18:38.925 --> 00:18:43.385
So we have to think through the lens there to understand

389
00:18:43.385 --> 00:18:47.145
that, okay, apocalyptic language does

390
00:18:47.935 --> 00:18:49.425
have a lot of symbolism.

391
00:18:49.485 --> 00:18:52.105
It does have a lot of things that can mean multiple things.

392
00:18:52.245 --> 00:18:56.905
It, it's hard, but it can't mean what it never meant.

393
00:18:57.935 --> 00:19:00.275
So just keep that in mind as you go through your study,

394
00:19:00.335 --> 00:19:03.955
as you think through it, it can't mean what it never meant.

395
00:19:05.335 --> 00:19:07.755
So let me just talk through a few things about

396
00:19:08.185 --> 00:19:09.315
that kind of idea.

397
00:19:09.905 --> 00:19:11.675
When you think about the book of Revelation or,

398
00:19:11.675 --> 00:19:14.955
or any apocalyptic literature, uh, there,

399
00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:16.795
why is it so uncertain?

400
00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.315
Why are we so uncertain about these things?

401
00:19:18.375 --> 00:19:20.795
If an event is prophesied, it'll surely happen, right?

402
00:19:21.705 --> 00:19:26.435
Well, yes, but there's complicating factors here.

403
00:19:26.815 --> 00:19:28.755
How will it happen? When will it happen?

404
00:19:29.255 --> 00:19:31.595
Interpretation complicated by a couple things.

405
00:19:31.645 --> 00:19:36.375
First, symbolism, there is a lot of

406
00:19:38.235 --> 00:19:40.735
debate over whether something like Revelation 13,

407
00:19:40.855 --> 00:19:42.295
I saw a beast rising outta the sea.

408
00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:45.255
10 horns, seven heads, 10 dims on its horns,

409
00:19:45.455 --> 00:19:46.655
blasphemous names on its heads.

410
00:19:46.715 --> 00:19:48.335
The beast I saw was like a leopard.

411
00:19:48.595 --> 00:19:49.735
Its feet were like a bears.

412
00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.255
Its mouth was like a lion's mouth.

413
00:19:52.045 --> 00:19:55.335
Okay, that sounds like a Godzilla movie in some ways, right?

414
00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:59.825
So either that is literal

415
00:20:01.305 --> 00:20:02.485
it, it's probably not.

416
00:20:04.355 --> 00:20:06.755
I mean, maybe it is. I'm not gonna die on that hill,

417
00:20:06.775 --> 00:20:08.195
but it's probably not.

418
00:20:09.425 --> 00:20:12.125
So since it's a figurative idea, then it's open

419
00:20:12.125 --> 00:20:13.285
to various interpretations.

420
00:20:14.675 --> 00:20:15.805
What do those crowns mean?

421
00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:17.925
What is the, how many heads does it have?

422
00:20:17.925 --> 00:20:19.685
Well, why does that mean? Is it 10 Roman emperors?

423
00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:21.445
And, you know, you could start going

424
00:20:21.445 --> 00:20:22.485
through all kinds of things.

425
00:20:22.635 --> 00:20:24.045
It's anybody's guess and everybody

426
00:20:24.045 --> 00:20:25.165
does guess about it, right?

427
00:20:25.905 --> 00:20:28.005
So that's part of the difference. Symbolism.

428
00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:29.685
Then there's typology,

429
00:20:29.775 --> 00:20:32.685
which is also like multiple occurrence effect.

430
00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:36.925
So there's times in one Corinthians Romans where Paul says,

431
00:20:37.145 --> 00:20:39.285
events that previously occurred in the Old Testament,

432
00:20:39.285 --> 00:20:42.205
where really future predictions called types of things

433
00:20:42.205 --> 00:20:43.685
that happen again in the New Testament.

434
00:20:44.425 --> 00:20:46.325
So e Egypt people

435
00:20:46.325 --> 00:20:49.405
of Israel fleeing Egypt, crossing the Red Sea.

436
00:20:50.425 --> 00:20:51.525
He uses that to say,

437
00:20:51.525 --> 00:20:54.325
Christians fleeing sin baptized in the blood of Christ

438
00:20:54.325 --> 00:20:56.045
through the Red Sea in a sense.

439
00:20:56.785 --> 00:21:00.725
So an event can happen twice, more than twice.

440
00:21:00.795 --> 00:21:04.365
Like you, you see how that complicates the interpretation.

441
00:21:05.185 --> 00:21:07.845
Uh, there's also some of similars called the double peak.

442
00:21:08.305 --> 00:21:11.965
Double peak effect, where one event is really two events,

443
00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:15.285
and there's prophets that are in the Old Testament looking

444
00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:18.085
ahead and they see all

445
00:21:18.085 --> 00:21:20.965
of events in the future happening once, um,

446
00:21:21.985 --> 00:21:25.165
all future events happening at once, I should say

447
00:21:25.675 --> 00:21:28.245
even if the two events are separated by an expansive time.

448
00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:30.605
So you think like you're seeing, um,

449
00:21:31.065 --> 00:21:32.565
you're looking from one side

450
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.685
and you're seeing what looks like one mountain

451
00:21:36.075 --> 00:21:37.325
with twin peaks.

452
00:21:38.225 --> 00:21:39.845
But what you don't realize is you're looking at two

453
00:21:40.005 --> 00:21:41.445
mountains that are separated, right?

454
00:21:42.345 --> 00:21:46.765
So there's a measure of that happening even in prophecies.

455
00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:49.605
So some of the elements of what this,

456
00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:51.925
like Isaiah nine is an example for, to us,

457
00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:53.645
a child is born, uh, to us.

458
00:21:53.725 --> 00:21:56.245
A son is given. Isaiah is looking ahead 700 years.

459
00:21:56.785 --> 00:22:00.205
And some of this was fulfilled when Jesus came.

460
00:22:00.645 --> 00:22:02.485
A son is given, child is born,

461
00:22:02.985 --> 00:22:04.525
the government shall be upon his shoulder.

462
00:22:04.555 --> 00:22:08.175
Well, that's somewhere out there, right?

463
00:22:08.275 --> 00:22:10.895
Not at the same time of zero whatever year

464
00:22:10.895 --> 00:22:12.015
it was when Jesus was born.

465
00:22:12.315 --> 00:22:14.615
His name shall be called wonderful counselor. Okay?

466
00:22:14.715 --> 00:22:16.255
That's true. Mighty God.

467
00:22:16.255 --> 00:22:19.255
Everlasting Father, prince of peace, yes, of the increase

468
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:21.295
of his government peace, there'll be no end.

469
00:22:21.805 --> 00:22:23.615
Okay, well that sounds that way.

470
00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:25.175
So like he's looking ahead

471
00:22:25.175 --> 00:22:27.375
and he's seeing all of this happen as one event,

472
00:22:28.605 --> 00:22:30.575
even though it's multiple events.

473
00:22:30.835 --> 00:22:34.415
Two, at least that happening at different times. See that?

474
00:22:36.325 --> 00:22:39.985
So that's the double peak effect that complicates prophecy.

475
00:22:40.325 --> 00:22:42.825
The conflation effect is another one.

476
00:22:42.965 --> 00:22:44.265
Two events are really one.

477
00:22:45.285 --> 00:22:47.545
So first century Jews looked for two different figures

478
00:22:47.545 --> 00:22:48.985
who were prophesied in the Old Testament.

479
00:22:49.325 --> 00:22:50.825
One was the kingly Messiah,

480
00:22:51.365 --> 00:22:53.025
the other was the suffering servant.

481
00:22:54.135 --> 00:22:55.145
They did not know.

482
00:22:56.085 --> 00:22:57.665
And the Old Testament scriptures don't,

483
00:22:57.665 --> 00:22:59.265
don't make it really obvious that both

484
00:22:59.265 --> 00:23:00.425
figures were one and the same.

485
00:23:01.485 --> 00:23:03.785
So they're looking for a messiah and a suffering servant.

486
00:23:03.855 --> 00:23:07.105
They didn't realize that that's actually coming in God,

487
00:23:07.105 --> 00:23:08.145
the Son in flesh.

488
00:23:09.285 --> 00:23:11.705
So you can see how this is so complicated, right?

489
00:23:12.165 --> 00:23:14.345
All of those things make, when you look at prophecy

490
00:23:14.345 --> 00:23:15.745
and you look at these things like, whew,

491
00:23:15.985 --> 00:23:17.745
I don't which one is it?

492
00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:21.305
That's why there's so many different ways to interpret this,

493
00:23:21.435 --> 00:23:26.065
which is why we have to be really loose in our handling of

494
00:23:26.175 --> 00:23:29.105
what we believe and dogmatically say.

495
00:23:30.595 --> 00:23:32.815
Now, here's another question people have about that.

496
00:23:32.875 --> 00:23:35.295
Is Christ scheduled to return next?

497
00:23:36.475 --> 00:23:38.455
Is that the next thing that's going to happen?

498
00:23:40.645 --> 00:23:42.415
Well, this is a way we can disagree.

499
00:23:42.735 --> 00:23:46.525
'cause there's varieties of arguments for both sides of it.

500
00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:49.405
Is it the very next thing that happens according

501
00:23:49.405 --> 00:23:51.165
to prophecies, or is some other things supposed

502
00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:52.245
to happen before we get there?

503
00:23:53.075 --> 00:23:54.565
Well, there's some scriptures that argue

504
00:23:54.565 --> 00:23:55.925
that Christ is returning next.

505
00:23:55.925 --> 00:23:58.165
That's the very next thing that would happen.

506
00:23:58.385 --> 00:24:00.325
And there's urgency in some of these.

507
00:24:00.915 --> 00:24:02.525
Matthew 24, stay awake.

508
00:24:02.525 --> 00:24:05.805
You don't know what day your Lord is coming be ready.

509
00:24:05.865 --> 00:24:07.925
The son of man's coming in an hour. You don't expect.

510
00:24:07.955 --> 00:24:10.485
That seems to indicate that's urgent next.

511
00:24:13.075 --> 00:24:17.175
But then there's others that think

512
00:24:17.175 --> 00:24:18.775
that there should be other things that happen

513
00:24:19.195 --> 00:24:20.295
before Christ return.

514
00:24:20.295 --> 00:24:22.855
This is the preaching of the gospel to all nations.

515
00:24:23.325 --> 00:24:26.175
Mark 13, the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations.

516
00:24:26.475 --> 00:24:29.585
Has that happened yet? You could say yes,

517
00:24:29.725 --> 00:24:32.625
but you could also say, no, we don't know.

518
00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:36.545
Uh, then there's language about the great tribulation, uh,

519
00:24:36.545 --> 00:24:38.625
that is that happening now?

520
00:24:38.765 --> 00:24:40.105
Is it going to happen someday?

521
00:24:40.325 --> 00:24:42.345
And there's debates about those things, right?

522
00:24:42.485 --> 00:24:45.985
So even those, there, there's stuff that could happen

523
00:24:46.165 --> 00:24:49.785
before, uh, like antichrist, false prophet, salvation

524
00:24:49.785 --> 00:24:51.305
of Israel and how that plays out.

525
00:24:51.305 --> 00:24:52.905
If that's a full salvation

526
00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:55.665
or if it's gonna be partial signs in the heavens.

527
00:24:55.665 --> 00:24:57.145
You got all the sun

528
00:24:57.145 --> 00:24:58.825
and moon going dark, you got earthquakes,

529
00:24:58.825 --> 00:25:01.145
you got wars, all of those things.

530
00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:04.505
Are those gonna happen before? Have they already happened?

531
00:25:05.725 --> 00:25:07.745
We could say yes, but we also say no.

532
00:25:08.525 --> 00:25:09.785
That's what we're talking about.

533
00:25:09.785 --> 00:25:12.505
There's a lot of disagreement.

534
00:25:12.695 --> 00:25:13.905
What we don't, what we do know.

535
00:25:14.235 --> 00:25:18.455
Again, I said it Sunday, has Christ already returned? No.

536
00:25:19.315 --> 00:25:21.575
So we know that's still out there.

537
00:25:21.945 --> 00:25:26.095
Other things we're not a hundred percent sure about yet.

538
00:25:27.335 --> 00:25:29.795
So there you go. You got some of those complications

539
00:25:29.975 --> 00:25:31.875
and factors that come into it.

540
00:25:33.185 --> 00:25:37.275
Okay? So let me talk now about these.

541
00:25:39.075 --> 00:25:41.235
I I'd say schemes that sounds negative,

542
00:25:41.655 --> 00:25:46.195
but scheme is merely like a, a structure of

543
00:25:46.415 --> 00:25:48.675
how various people determine

544
00:25:48.935 --> 00:25:51.955
or signify what's going to happen.

545
00:25:52.695 --> 00:25:55.715
The order of events, the timing of the end.

546
00:25:56.455 --> 00:26:00.195
So this involves talks about the rapture, which is, uh,

547
00:26:00.395 --> 00:26:04.205
a belief that God is going to kind of, in many ways,

548
00:26:04.355 --> 00:26:07.725
invisibly remove his believers, either partially

549
00:26:07.725 --> 00:26:11.085
or fully at one time, kind of surprisingly to the world,

550
00:26:11.355 --> 00:26:13.005
just kind of poof, they're gone.

551
00:26:13.785 --> 00:26:15.365
Uh, it involves, that involves the

552
00:26:15.525 --> 00:26:16.685
millennium thousand years.

553
00:26:17.215 --> 00:26:19.045
Revelation 20 talks about that.

554
00:26:19.225 --> 00:26:21.605
Is, is that a literal thousand years

555
00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:23.165
or is it kind of figurative?

556
00:26:23.165 --> 00:26:24.205
There's questions there.

557
00:26:24.825 --> 00:26:26.525
And then in relation to the tribulation,

558
00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:28.325
some people will say it's seven year tribulation,

559
00:26:28.325 --> 00:26:29.725
or is it extended or is it partial?

560
00:26:29.945 --> 00:26:32.805
And those kind of things. So these are just ways, again,

561
00:26:33.045 --> 00:26:34.525
there's problems with all of these,

562
00:26:35.785 --> 00:26:38.205
but I wanna show you these, at least just give some exposure

563
00:26:38.745 --> 00:26:41.045
to what is out there, because maybe you've heard one

564
00:26:41.045 --> 00:26:42.405
way, specifically your whole life.

565
00:26:42.615 --> 00:26:44.085
Maybe you read a series of books

566
00:26:44.355 --> 00:26:46.885
that portrayed one specific way, uh, that

567
00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:48.765
that could be right, it could be wrong,

568
00:26:48.905 --> 00:26:50.965
but this is just a variety of ways

569
00:26:50.995 --> 00:26:52.285
that people interpret this.

570
00:26:52.285 --> 00:26:53.885
So the first one I wanna show you is called

571
00:26:54.225 --> 00:26:55.245
ah, millennialism.

572
00:26:56.305 --> 00:26:58.405
Uh, this, uh, we'll put 'em up on the screen.

573
00:26:58.405 --> 00:27:01.165
Hopefully you can see, and maybe you can't see it perfectly,

574
00:27:01.225 --> 00:27:05.695
but at least you'll get a picture for it, a millennialism.

575
00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:07.775
So ah, means no.

576
00:27:07.965 --> 00:27:11.615
Anytime you see that at the beginning of the phrase,

577
00:27:12.015 --> 00:27:16.335
a millennial, there is no future millennium at all.

578
00:27:17.555 --> 00:27:22.105
Uh, what they say is, we have that, Jonathan. Yeah.

579
00:27:22.295 --> 00:27:25.945
Okay. So this would be a millennialism

580
00:27:26.635 --> 00:27:29.985
where you can see that the millennium is happening now

581
00:27:30.685 --> 00:27:34.185
in the church age, this is the millennium and it's, uh, or,

582
00:27:34.205 --> 00:27:36.385
and or happening to dead believers who are now in heaven.

583
00:27:36.385 --> 00:27:37.825
There's no rapture involved here.

584
00:27:37.825 --> 00:27:40.905
There's no real tribulation involved here in the sense

585
00:27:40.905 --> 00:27:42.225
of seven years or anything like that.

586
00:27:42.705 --> 00:27:44.385
Christ's death, resurrection, ascension

587
00:27:44.995 --> 00:27:46.625
began the millennium.

588
00:27:47.485 --> 00:27:48.705
Uh, the kingdom of Satan

589
00:27:48.705 --> 00:27:50.265
and church is in stalemate, kind

590
00:27:50.265 --> 00:27:51.945
of fighting it out in a way right now.

591
00:27:52.565 --> 00:27:54.105
Uh, millennium is in heaven only.

592
00:27:54.245 --> 00:27:56.025
The earthly church is always in tribulation.

593
00:27:56.095 --> 00:27:57.505
There's not a seven year thing.

594
00:27:57.505 --> 00:27:59.145
It's kind of all happening right now

595
00:27:59.715 --> 00:28:02.305
until the final rebellion, which is at the moment

596
00:28:02.485 --> 00:28:03.985
of Jesus's return.

597
00:28:04.295 --> 00:28:05.985
That all happens kind of conjunctively.

598
00:28:06.645 --> 00:28:09.265
So here's some strengths and weaknesses. Pro it's simple.

599
00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:11.385
It's clear Christ returns.

600
00:28:11.415 --> 00:28:14.465
Once there's an end, a scripture seems to indicate it,

601
00:28:14.465 --> 00:28:16.265
it cleans up the end a lot.

602
00:28:17.745 --> 00:28:20.205
The con is, it seems to ignore or wanna explain away.

603
00:28:20.205 --> 00:28:22.965
Revelation 20, which talks about Jesus reigning

604
00:28:22.965 --> 00:28:25.005
for a million or a thousand years, uh,

605
00:28:25.005 --> 00:28:26.925
the Satan being locked away for a thousand years.

606
00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:29.005
Uh, and then another con is

607
00:28:29.005 --> 00:28:30.205
that Christ's return is not next.

608
00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:34.205
Other things happen before his return.

609
00:28:34.705 --> 00:28:37.885
So all the scriptures that debated that this is one way

610
00:28:38.075 --> 00:28:40.765
that there is no technically thousand year millennium.

611
00:28:41.305 --> 00:28:42.765
It is all happening right now.

612
00:28:43.345 --> 00:28:47.725
That's one, uh, post, post millennialism is the next one.

613
00:28:48.705 --> 00:28:52.525
And you'll see that coming up here where Christ will return

614
00:28:53.135 --> 00:28:55.445
after the millennium post means

615
00:28:55.495 --> 00:28:58.525
after, of course, uh, it tends to believe

616
00:28:58.555 --> 00:29:01.005
that the great tribulations already occurred.

617
00:29:02.035 --> 00:29:03.935
Uh, there is no rapture.

618
00:29:04.555 --> 00:29:07.175
The millennium is figurative in the sense

619
00:29:07.175 --> 00:29:09.535
that Christ's kingdom is growing in our hearts right now.

620
00:29:10.205 --> 00:29:14.455
That his millennium, his is, uh, is right now happening

621
00:29:14.555 --> 00:29:16.615
inside of us in a sense

622
00:29:16.965 --> 00:29:20.895
that his rule is growing on the earth right now.

623
00:29:22.075 --> 00:29:25.055
Uh, that the great tribulation was in Ad 70 when Rome

624
00:29:25.285 --> 00:29:26.375
destroyed Jerusalem.

625
00:29:26.445 --> 00:29:28.215
That was kind of all around that time.

626
00:29:28.215 --> 00:29:33.015
And we've now gone into it. It's also simple and clear.

627
00:29:33.015 --> 00:29:36.335
Christ returns once there's an end, as scripture seems

628
00:29:36.335 --> 00:29:39.655
to indicate it, it also makes that revelation 20,000 years

629
00:29:40.335 --> 00:29:43.405
metaphorical again in this day and age.

630
00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:48.725
So it does apply Revelation 20, but it also talks some cons.

631
00:29:48.785 --> 00:29:51.845
It also talks a lot symbolic about these scriptures.

632
00:29:51.845 --> 00:29:53.125
There's no indication in the text they

633
00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:54.285
should be interpreted symbolically.

634
00:29:54.445 --> 00:29:56.005
A lot of them are because of this.

635
00:29:56.745 --> 00:29:59.405
It was also really popular before World War I.

636
00:30:00.585 --> 00:30:03.325
So, uh, everybody was like, man, things are going great.

637
00:30:03.325 --> 00:30:04.405
Things are progressing,

638
00:30:04.545 --> 00:30:08.085
and then the world falls apart in World War I

639
00:30:08.085 --> 00:30:10.125
and people kind of like, uh, maybe that's not true.

640
00:30:10.855 --> 00:30:13.365
Maybe it's not progressing all the way

641
00:30:13.365 --> 00:30:14.805
towards when Jesus returns.

642
00:30:14.825 --> 00:30:16.845
That's maybe a little bit there.

643
00:30:17.425 --> 00:30:19.885
Um, so it's not as widely held anymore.

644
00:30:20.665 --> 00:30:23.005
The world no longer seems to be progressing into harmony

645
00:30:23.145 --> 00:30:25.285
and becoming universally Christian, which is kind of

646
00:30:25.285 --> 00:30:26.325
what this indicates.

647
00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:28.805
Uh, and Christ returns not next.

648
00:30:28.805 --> 00:30:30.525
Other things have to happen. So that's another one.

649
00:30:30.525 --> 00:30:31.525
Post millennialism.

650
00:30:32.105 --> 00:30:36.645
Here's the next one, dispensational, pre millennialism.

651
00:30:36.945 --> 00:30:39.525
Now, there's a variety of versions of this one.

652
00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:44.005
So dispensational, I mean, dispensational like God kind of

653
00:30:44.875 --> 00:30:47.605
dispenses his grace, presence,

654
00:30:48.205 --> 00:30:49.805
salvation in some different way.

655
00:30:49.805 --> 00:30:52.245
They, there's extreme versions that he saves differently,

656
00:30:52.305 --> 00:30:56.285
but I don't think that's where anybody would be, um, uh, uh,

657
00:30:56.285 --> 00:30:58.045
that he works in different ways, in different times,

658
00:30:58.675 --> 00:31:00.165
dispenses things.

659
00:31:00.185 --> 00:31:03.645
And so pre millennialism would be that God does something

660
00:31:03.705 --> 00:31:06.405
before this millennial timeframe.

661
00:31:06.755 --> 00:31:07.885
There's two versions.

662
00:31:07.885 --> 00:31:11.085
There's pre Tribulational, which is this one,

663
00:31:11.505 --> 00:31:13.645
and then we'll get to another one here in a second.

664
00:31:14.305 --> 00:31:16.645
Uh, but what this is, this involves the rapture.

665
00:31:16.915 --> 00:31:19.485
This one is when you read the left behind books

666
00:31:19.505 --> 00:31:22.445
or watch the left behind movies, this is this to a T.

667
00:31:23.385 --> 00:31:26.805
Um, there's a rapture of the church secret.

668
00:31:27.625 --> 00:31:29.685
The tribulation happens for seven years.

669
00:31:30.075 --> 00:31:32.685
Then there's a second coming where Christ comes

670
00:31:32.835 --> 00:31:35.885
with the church to begin the millennium a thousand years.

671
00:31:36.225 --> 00:31:37.605
And then the last judgment happens,

672
00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:39.125
and then eternity happens.

673
00:31:39.265 --> 00:31:42.005
And so there's some prose to this that the scriptures,

674
00:31:42.475 --> 00:31:43.565
some would indicate

675
00:31:43.565 --> 00:31:45.965
that Christians will be delivered from the hour of testing,

676
00:31:46.535 --> 00:31:48.685
won't be in the tribulation, the wrath of God.

677
00:31:48.705 --> 00:31:49.805
We won't feel any of that.

678
00:31:49.945 --> 00:31:53.805
So pre-trib, you're out before the tribulation happens.

679
00:31:55.095 --> 00:31:57.315
But other scriptures, this is a, a con to this.

680
00:31:57.315 --> 00:32:00.195
Other scriptures say that Christians will suffer

681
00:32:00.735 --> 00:32:03.555
and die even during the tribulation.

682
00:32:04.375 --> 00:32:06.035
So there's some scriptures

683
00:32:06.035 --> 00:32:07.355
that kinda go back and forth on that.

684
00:32:08.055 --> 00:32:10.995
Uh, another pro is that the, the phrase,

685
00:32:11.055 --> 00:32:13.275
the church is not mentioned by name in the book

686
00:32:13.275 --> 00:32:15.035
of Revelation after the first three chapters.

687
00:32:15.335 --> 00:32:19.395
So did God take them before all of the rest of we could be?

688
00:32:20.055 --> 00:32:22.155
Um, but that's not a sufficient argument.

689
00:32:22.155 --> 00:32:25.555
That's an argument from silence, which is not always, uh,

690
00:32:25.715 --> 00:32:28.715
a good evidence appeal to ignorance that we just

691
00:32:28.835 --> 00:32:30.075
'cause we don't know it's there or not.

692
00:32:30.095 --> 00:32:31.795
We think it's not Well, that's not

693
00:32:32.435 --> 00:32:34.195
evidence against it being there.

694
00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:36.515
You don't see Buicks

695
00:32:36.565 --> 00:32:39.205
after the book of Revelation chapter three either.

696
00:32:39.345 --> 00:32:40.485
So it doesn't mean they're not there.

697
00:32:40.515 --> 00:32:42.365
It's so you see it, it's like an argument from silence.

698
00:32:43.305 --> 00:32:46.005
Um, Christ will be returning

699
00:32:46.025 --> 00:32:48.005
as another pro at the end of the tribulation.

700
00:32:48.005 --> 00:32:49.845
So true believers will have to be raptured earlier.

701
00:32:50.025 --> 00:32:51.765
So the church comes with him, okay, maybe.

702
00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:53.525
Um, but there's no way that,

703
00:32:53.595 --> 00:32:56.205
there's no reason the church could not meet Jesus in the

704
00:32:56.305 --> 00:32:59.365
clouds and immediately turn and come back to Earth.

705
00:32:59.545 --> 00:33:01.845
So there's all kinds of debates there.

706
00:33:02.435 --> 00:33:07.085
There's also a, the next one is mid trib, pre boy.

707
00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.085
These are hard words to say.

708
00:33:08.865 --> 00:33:12.085
Mid trib dispensational, pre millennialism

709
00:33:13.505 --> 00:33:14.565
say that three times fast.

710
00:33:15.435 --> 00:33:18.125
This is where the tribulation starts.

711
00:33:18.225 --> 00:33:22.405
And believers are involved in the tribulation just midway

712
00:33:22.405 --> 00:33:25.605
through, halfway through three and a half years.

713
00:33:25.605 --> 00:33:28.485
Three and a half years. The rapture happens there.

714
00:33:29.305 --> 00:33:30.485
Um, the great tribulations,

715
00:33:30.485 --> 00:33:31.645
the back half of the seven years.

716
00:33:32.505 --> 00:33:35.485
Um, okay, great distinction,

717
00:33:35.945 --> 00:33:38.245
but the Bible never says anything about that.

718
00:33:38.505 --> 00:33:40.485
So we're kind of making that up in some ways.

719
00:33:41.465 --> 00:33:44.645
Um, and then God's wrath and some things like there,

720
00:33:44.645 --> 00:33:46.805
but that, that's a harder one to defend.

721
00:33:47.875 --> 00:33:48.885
Then this last one,

722
00:33:49.435 --> 00:33:51.205
there's probably more, but I'm just giving you another one here.

723
00:33:51.205 --> 00:33:55.325
This is classic or historic pre millennialism.

724
00:33:56.715 --> 00:34:01.085
This is what most before, uh, Darby

725
00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:04.085
and Schofield and Rry in the late 18 hundreds.

726
00:34:04.635 --> 00:34:06.365
They are the, the purveyors

727
00:34:06.365 --> 00:34:11.165
of this pre-millennial dispensationalism, um, pre-trib,

728
00:34:11.165 --> 00:34:13.165
that kind of stuff that didn't come till late in the 18

729
00:34:13.165 --> 00:34:15.805
hundreds really promoted this one.

730
00:34:15.955 --> 00:34:20.245
This pre-millennial stance was long before that.

731
00:34:20.265 --> 00:34:23.005
So that's why they call it historic pre millennialism

732
00:34:23.035 --> 00:34:26.085
that Christ will return before the millennium, but

733
00:34:26.085 --> 00:34:29.445
after the tribulation, there's only one second coming.

734
00:34:31.175 --> 00:34:32.915
Um, so strengths

735
00:34:32.915 --> 00:34:36.075
and weaknesses, it's clear, it reads this catal scriptures

736
00:34:36.075 --> 00:34:39.555
literally when it can, uh, you don't dismiss some of it.

737
00:34:39.735 --> 00:34:41.315
The other thing though, it's a negative, is

738
00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:42.555
that Christ's return is not next.

739
00:34:42.605 --> 00:34:43.875
Other things happen first, which

740
00:34:43.875 --> 00:34:45.115
again, scriptures seem to indicate.

741
00:34:45.115 --> 00:34:46.075
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

742
00:34:46.255 --> 00:34:47.275
You can put that back up there.

743
00:34:47.275 --> 00:34:51.655
Leave it up there. Um, Christians will suffer

744
00:34:51.675 --> 00:34:54.015
and die in tribulation that talks about that in scripture.

745
00:34:54.355 --> 00:34:55.975
Others say it might be spared.

746
00:34:56.035 --> 00:34:58.655
So this says we all go through the great tribulation

747
00:34:58.955 --> 00:35:00.055
and some will die in it.

748
00:35:00.445 --> 00:35:01.855
Okay? Is that true? Or we don't know.

749
00:35:03.245 --> 00:35:07.455
It's also a pro that it's better to prepare for a

750
00:35:08.325 --> 00:35:10.855
post-trip rapture, then a pre-trib rapture.

751
00:35:10.925 --> 00:35:12.975
Because a pre-trib rapture is easy.

752
00:35:13.755 --> 00:35:16.775
It requires nothing of us, we believe.

753
00:35:16.835 --> 00:35:18.415
And then all of a sudden we're just gonna be poof

754
00:35:18.415 --> 00:35:19.975
and we're gone and we're in heaven.

755
00:35:21.175 --> 00:35:23.775
A post-trip, rapture will require everything.

756
00:35:25.225 --> 00:35:26.615
Christians should be prepared to give

757
00:35:26.615 --> 00:35:27.695
of everything for Christ.

758
00:35:28.175 --> 00:35:31.535
There'll be some who fall away, quote unquote Matthew 24,

759
00:35:32.085 --> 00:35:35.815
because they're relying too much on a pre-trib rapture

760
00:35:35.815 --> 00:35:37.285
and too little on Christ himself.

761
00:35:38.145 --> 00:35:39.885
And that's, that's a commendable position.

762
00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:42.965
But it's not an argument in itself

763
00:35:42.965 --> 00:35:44.645
that a post-trip rapture is true.

764
00:35:44.825 --> 00:35:45.845
We, we just don't know.

765
00:35:46.425 --> 00:35:48.565
So we can't definitively say Scripture says

766
00:35:48.565 --> 00:35:49.725
this is how it's going to be.

767
00:35:50.225 --> 00:35:53.045
So that's a lot of the discussion

768
00:35:53.045 --> 00:35:56.285
that comes up when you talk about the end time

769
00:35:56.755 --> 00:35:58.085
schemes, structures.

770
00:35:58.355 --> 00:36:01.805
There's more than that. Those are just kind of the basics.

771
00:36:01.945 --> 00:36:04.805
You could get some more understanding. We got books up here.

772
00:36:05.225 --> 00:36:06.845
You can find stuff online as well.

773
00:36:07.435 --> 00:36:10.285
Alright, so I wanted to leave time

774
00:36:11.225 --> 00:36:13.085
to have some fun conversations about this.

775
00:36:13.185 --> 00:36:14.845
And so I'm gonna invite Steve

776
00:36:14.845 --> 00:36:17.725
and Joe, two of our elders up here to help me with that,

777
00:36:17.725 --> 00:36:19.845
because none of us have all the answers.

778
00:36:20.585 --> 00:36:23.405
And, uh, we'll tell you when we don't know the answer.

779
00:36:24.105 --> 00:36:27.085
But, uh, what we do know is that there's questions.

780
00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:29.205
So you got a mic here and a mic here.

781
00:36:30.695 --> 00:36:33.405
Let's see what happens. And we'll go from there.

782
00:36:33.865 --> 00:36:36.005
Uh, but try to give you as much information

783
00:36:36.145 --> 00:36:38.005
as I could about those things in a basic way.

784
00:36:38.425 --> 00:36:40.125
And then let the Lord just continue

785
00:36:40.125 --> 00:36:41.325
to lead you in those ways.

786
00:36:41.385 --> 00:36:43.565
So what questions do you have? Come up with that or else?

787
00:36:43.585 --> 00:36:45.085
I'm gonna have to come up with questions for these guys.

788
00:36:45.465 --> 00:36:46.525
See what we go from there.

789
00:36:54.925 --> 00:36:58.775
Good evening. I figured there'd be like a line at

790
00:36:58.775 --> 00:36:59.935
the mics already.

791
00:37:06.905 --> 00:37:08.275
Okay. Janie's, yeah.

792
00:37:09.225 --> 00:37:11.755
Some would say that, um,

793
00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:16.875
the prophecies that have already been fulfilled

794
00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:19.795
have been fulfilled literally.

795
00:37:22.055 --> 00:37:26.595
And because of that, and we've talked about, uh,

796
00:37:26.615 --> 00:37:28.835
before at Henderson Hills

797
00:37:29.645 --> 00:37:33.075
about scripture interpreting scripture, uh,

798
00:37:33.215 --> 00:37:37.955
if they've been fulfilled, literally, is it realistic

799
00:37:39.135 --> 00:37:43.075
to think that even though it is apocalyptic literature,

800
00:37:43.785 --> 00:37:47.915
that those events that are detailed in the book

801
00:37:48.075 --> 00:37:52.475
of Revelation will also be literally fulfilled?

802
00:37:53.385 --> 00:37:55.115
Yeah, that's a good question. That's a good question.

803
00:37:55.195 --> 00:37:56.595
I think there's, there's a measure

804
00:37:56.595 --> 00:37:58.795
of the prophecies are not all apocalyptic.

805
00:37:59.455 --> 00:38:03.155
And so some of the prophecies are very literal, very direct.

806
00:38:03.495 --> 00:38:07.515
And so, like to us, a child is born, well, child was born.

807
00:38:07.775 --> 00:38:10.875
So yes, prophecies are fulfilled.

808
00:38:11.655 --> 00:38:14.675
Uh, but that's what I started with earlier about the debates

809
00:38:14.675 --> 00:38:15.915
of how they're fulfilled

810
00:38:15.915 --> 00:38:18.475
and the dual profit, dual fulfillment and things like that.

811
00:38:18.475 --> 00:38:19.475
That they're looking ahead

812
00:38:19.475 --> 00:38:22.795
and seeing things, um, when they were

813
00:38:23.585 --> 00:38:25.995
back then they're looking ahead to future events,

814
00:38:25.995 --> 00:38:28.115
just like we're now looking ahead to future events.

815
00:38:29.095 --> 00:38:30.875
So I think though the fact that some

816
00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:33.515
of those were not apocalyptic prophecies

817
00:38:34.015 --> 00:38:37.635
and were fulfilled literally doesn't necessarily mean

818
00:38:37.635 --> 00:38:40.155
that all of the apocalyptic prophecies that have yet

819
00:38:40.155 --> 00:38:42.035
to come would also have to be fulfilled.

820
00:38:42.145 --> 00:38:44.715
Literally. They might be, they might, but,

821
00:38:44.935 --> 00:38:48.355
but when you read those things, you kind of think, is

822
00:38:48.355 --> 00:38:50.955
that gonna be 10 heads on an eight

823
00:38:51.655 --> 00:38:52.675
beasts and things like that?

824
00:38:53.365 --> 00:38:56.435
Maybe that would be kind of cool to see, I guess.

825
00:38:56.495 --> 00:38:59.955
But, but at the same time, will that happen like that?

826
00:39:00.655 --> 00:39:03.675
So it's a, that's part of the reason the debate happens is

827
00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:06.275
because people would say absolutely, they have

828
00:39:06.275 --> 00:39:07.315
to be literal, all of them,

829
00:39:07.695 --> 00:39:10.235
or there's ways to interpret those things.

830
00:39:10.235 --> 00:39:11.475
When you even look at Ezekiel

831
00:39:11.495 --> 00:39:12.795
and some of the things he was saying

832
00:39:13.345 --> 00:39:17.745
that were then fulfilled later, there's some, I guess,

833
00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:21.265
apocalyptic prophecies he's making that could be considered

834
00:39:22.135 --> 00:39:26.705
fulfilled, not literally as well, even in past tense for us.

835
00:39:27.215 --> 00:39:29.305
Well, I know that a lot of prophecy

836
00:39:30.305 --> 00:39:34.785
teachers will say there is partial fulfillment

837
00:39:35.445 --> 00:39:36.825
in some prophecies.

838
00:39:37.445 --> 00:39:39.705
Uh, there is future fulfillment

839
00:39:41.205 --> 00:39:45.225
and, um, some prophecies are fulfilled

840
00:39:45.335 --> 00:39:46.585
more than once.

841
00:39:47.415 --> 00:39:50.725
Yeah. Which is what you were referring to

842
00:39:51.765 --> 00:39:55.125
I think when you said, you know, some

843
00:39:55.125 --> 00:39:59.045
of those things like AD 70, the temple was destroyed.

844
00:39:59.115 --> 00:40:04.085
Yeah. Um, but was that the tribulation?

845
00:40:04.675 --> 00:40:08.325
Well, probably not, but um,

846
00:40:09.865 --> 00:40:12.245
so, uh, it can be partially fulfilled

847
00:40:12.945 --> 00:40:16.645
or it can be, uh, it could be totally in the future

848
00:40:17.425 --> 00:40:19.725
or it may be fulfilled more than once.

849
00:40:20.995 --> 00:40:23.125
Yeah, the same prophecy. It does, it

850
00:40:23.125 --> 00:40:24.125
Makes, it's the hard part. Hard.

851
00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:26.725
That's the hard, but, yeah. Yeah.

852
00:40:26.795 --> 00:40:27.925
Good question, Jay. Thank you.

853
00:40:28.435 --> 00:40:31.965
Yeah, I, go ahead. I just follow up and agree with that.

854
00:40:32.585 --> 00:40:36.805
Uh, I, I think if we think about the religious experts, uh,

855
00:40:37.025 --> 00:40:40.005
in the second century, uh, BC

856
00:40:40.715 --> 00:40:45.035
looking at the prophecy of Christ, I don't think any

857
00:40:45.035 --> 00:40:46.235
of 'em would've been able

858
00:40:46.355 --> 00:40:48.675
to diagram it out the way it happened.

859
00:40:49.375 --> 00:40:51.475
But from the backside, looking back,

860
00:40:51.725 --> 00:40:53.555
those prophecies make perfect sense.

861
00:40:54.455 --> 00:40:55.795
So I think that's why we have

862
00:40:55.795 --> 00:40:58.475
to hold loosely when somebody says they have the answer.

863
00:40:59.255 --> 00:41:00.475
It doesn't mean we don't study,

864
00:41:01.255 --> 00:41:04.215
but I think we need to hold our conclusions loosely.

865
00:41:04.275 --> 00:41:05.775
But the prophecies do come true.

866
00:41:06.635 --> 00:41:08.935
And I think from the perspective of heaven, we'll say,

867
00:41:09.155 --> 00:41:10.255
oh, that's what it was.

868
00:41:11.085 --> 00:41:12.755
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

869
00:41:13.625 --> 00:41:16.235
John, you can take that off now that we're good. Thank you.

870
00:41:16.235 --> 00:41:17.235
Alright, Jacob.

871
00:41:18.545 --> 00:41:22.995
So I've had a bunch of friends, whether believers

872
00:41:22.995 --> 00:41:27.035
or non-believers when it comes to the questions of

873
00:41:27.145 --> 00:41:29.275
regarding Revelation, one of the biggest ones

874
00:41:29.275 --> 00:41:33.685
that's always stumped me and hard to explain is the 144,000.

875
00:41:34.345 --> 00:41:35.725
Wow. I've always kind of wanted

876
00:41:35.725 --> 00:41:39.485
to have a good explanation on how to go about that.

877
00:41:40.465 --> 00:41:43.685
The 144,000 mm-Hmm. The, yeah. Okay.

878
00:41:44.425 --> 00:41:45.605
You guys experts on that one?

879
00:41:46.675 --> 00:41:50.005
Well, the 144,000, uh, it actually describes

880
00:41:50.005 --> 00:41:54.205
that they come from, uh, particular tribes, uh, of Israel.

881
00:41:54.305 --> 00:41:59.045
So, uh, one would, uh, think that, uh,

882
00:42:00.395 --> 00:42:01.805
that they're Jewish evangelists.

883
00:42:01.805 --> 00:42:04.325
That's, that's the, the mantra

884
00:42:04.585 --> 00:42:08.445
of the pre-trib pre-millennial, uh, perspective.

885
00:42:08.665 --> 00:42:10.925
And I, I sure don't dis I'm not in a position

886
00:42:10.925 --> 00:42:12.085
to disagree with that at all.

887
00:42:13.415 --> 00:42:16.155
Uh, but it, uh, yeah, they're,

888
00:42:17.445 --> 00:42:18.445
Uh, yeah. So

889
00:42:18.445 --> 00:42:20.465
it's Revelation seven, where

890
00:42:20.485 --> 00:42:21.905
12,000 from each Yeah.

891
00:42:21.925 --> 00:42:22.945
Of the 12 tribes.

892
00:42:22.975 --> 00:42:24.305
Yeah. John looks into heaven

893
00:42:24.405 --> 00:42:26.785
and he says, uh, sealed the servants

894
00:42:26.785 --> 00:42:28.345
of our God on their foreheads heard for the number

895
00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:31.225
of the sealed, 144,000 sealed from every tribe with the Sons

896
00:42:31.225 --> 00:42:34.225
of Israel, 12,000 from each of the 12 tribes.

897
00:42:35.005 --> 00:42:36.025
Uh, and that's all it says.

898
00:42:36.645 --> 00:42:39.665
And so then they're sealed is what it says in that.

899
00:42:39.685 --> 00:42:43.705
So the debate commonly people would say that's, yeah,

900
00:42:43.885 --> 00:42:47.225
so the pre-trip Premil perspective would be that that's the

901
00:42:47.905 --> 00:42:52.265
144,000 sealed from the tribulation period

902
00:42:52.835 --> 00:42:56.745
where they were saved from the 12 tribes of Israel,

903
00:42:56.885 --> 00:42:59.025
the ethnic tribes of Israel into

904
00:42:59.725 --> 00:43:01.025
the kingdom of God that way.

905
00:43:01.685 --> 00:43:03.825
Um, others would say those are symbolic numbers,

906
00:43:04.135 --> 00:43:06.585
just like a lot of symbolic numbers in that,

907
00:43:06.785 --> 00:43:10.705
that just illustrates a large number of people

908
00:43:11.015 --> 00:43:12.185
because right after that,

909
00:43:12.185 --> 00:43:14.465
after this, I looked to behold a great multitude no one

910
00:43:14.465 --> 00:43:15.665
could number from every nation,

911
00:43:15.885 --> 00:43:17.225
tribes, peoples, and languages.

912
00:43:17.565 --> 00:43:19.625
So does he distinguish between those two things

913
00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:22.385
that there are specific numbers for people from Israel,

914
00:43:22.765 --> 00:43:26.065
and then are there a great multitude in general?

915
00:43:26.655 --> 00:43:28.425
Yeah, you could make that argument for sure.

916
00:43:29.045 --> 00:43:31.665
Uh, but what we do know is that there will be

917
00:43:32.215 --> 00:43:37.105
believers in Christ come from ethnic Israel at some point.

918
00:43:37.435 --> 00:43:38.865
There already are, have been,

919
00:43:39.085 --> 00:43:42.505
but at some point in the future, more will, whether

920
00:43:42.505 --> 00:43:44.545
that's all of them that's up for debate

921
00:43:44.545 --> 00:43:45.745
or whether that's just those

922
00:43:45.805 --> 00:43:48.065
who would be called like this out of

923
00:43:48.065 --> 00:43:49.265
that to believe in Christ.

924
00:43:49.655 --> 00:43:52.505
Yeah, that could be either way, I think there, yeah.

925
00:43:52.855 --> 00:43:57.835
Yeah. I just want to, my perspective is that

926
00:43:58.475 --> 00:44:01.995
I grew up in, um, in a church in Oklahoma City, um,

927
00:44:02.455 --> 00:44:03.595
the Baptist Temple.

928
00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:05.835
And not long after I was saved in the,

929
00:44:06.095 --> 00:44:10.755
in the early seventies, uh, we began a study on, uh, uh,

930
00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:12.515
the second coming and, uh,

931
00:44:13.215 --> 00:44:14.715
as a youth member of the youth group.

932
00:44:14.775 --> 00:44:16.515
And we used the Hal Lindsey's book,

933
00:44:16.575 --> 00:44:18.435
the Late Great Planet Earth, as something

934
00:44:18.435 --> 00:44:21.035
that we just talked about on and on and on,

935
00:44:21.055 --> 00:44:22.155
and on and on about.

936
00:44:22.695 --> 00:44:26.955
And so, um, so my recollection is

937
00:44:26.955 --> 00:44:28.355
that we were taught, uh,

938
00:44:29.415 --> 00:44:32.645
to readily accept a pre-trib pre-millennial

939
00:44:32.675 --> 00:44:33.765
view at the time.

940
00:44:34.585 --> 00:44:36.125
Uh, and then since that time,

941
00:44:36.125 --> 00:44:39.005
there had been other discussions and other books to read

942
00:44:39.145 --> 00:44:41.645
and things to, uh, to, to talk about.

943
00:44:41.905 --> 00:44:46.755
And recently our community group, we, uh, were using

944
00:44:46.855 --> 00:44:50.995
as kind of a guide for us, a a book entitled 20 Basics.

945
00:44:50.995 --> 00:44:53.035
Every Christian Should Know Why Wayne Gruden

946
00:44:53.035 --> 00:44:55.515
and has a chapter about judgements

947
00:44:55.655 --> 00:44:57.715
and those types of things that has

948
00:44:57.735 --> 00:44:58.915
and presented those views.

949
00:44:59.015 --> 00:45:02.475
So that's another source of things, of information

950
00:45:02.475 --> 00:45:03.955
that you may or may not want to use with

951
00:45:04.175 --> 00:45:05.235
to provide that information.

952
00:45:05.255 --> 00:45:08.315
But, uh, you know, the whole left behind series,

953
00:45:08.655 --> 00:45:10.915
Tim Le Hay books, uh, a lot of things, those types

954
00:45:10.915 --> 00:45:12.635
of things were very popular at the time.

955
00:45:13.135 --> 00:45:16.155
Uh, and so that is a, I remember as a youth, we,

956
00:45:16.215 --> 00:45:18.395
we just spent a lot of time talking about that.

957
00:45:18.635 --> 00:45:22.915
I mean, I'm, and uh, we really did spend a, uh, it had a,

958
00:45:22.915 --> 00:45:25.475
had an effect on me as a sophomore,

959
00:45:25.475 --> 00:45:26.755
junior in high school for sure.

960
00:45:26.935 --> 00:45:29.195
So I think we got You had a question. Yeah.

961
00:45:29.655 --> 00:45:31.435
Yes. Hi. Hey, um,

962
00:45:32.095 --> 00:45:36.355
I'm not sure if this is gonna make sense, but like people

963
00:45:36.535 --> 00:45:40.235
or believers who have already died, are they like in heaven?

964
00:45:40.305 --> 00:45:42.155
Like, do you believe that they're in heaven since

965
00:45:42.155 --> 00:45:43.235
Jesus hasn't come back?

966
00:45:43.305 --> 00:45:46.605
Like, or do you think they're waiting

967
00:45:47.185 --> 00:45:48.845
for like heaven to be good?

968
00:45:49.235 --> 00:45:50.325
Yeah, that, that's a good question.

969
00:45:50.325 --> 00:45:51.605
That's a very common question.

970
00:45:51.775 --> 00:45:52.925
Could you repeat the question?

971
00:45:53.245 --> 00:45:57.605
So it, it's believers who die either already have

972
00:45:57.745 --> 00:45:59.365
or will die before Jesus returns.

973
00:45:59.465 --> 00:46:03.565
Are they in heaven or is there kind of intermediate waiting?

974
00:46:04.745 --> 00:46:08.015
What's that state they would be in for now? Yeah.

975
00:46:09.085 --> 00:46:10.345
You've been in seminary, so

976
00:46:10.345 --> 00:46:11.385
you know the answer to that, right?

977
00:46:11.805 --> 00:46:16.185
So no, great. Um, okay.

978
00:46:16.245 --> 00:46:19.105
So you, you look at, just for example,

979
00:46:19.245 --> 00:46:21.585
you look at Jesus on the cross, two thieves.

980
00:46:22.175 --> 00:46:24.345
They're both gonna die and,

981
00:46:24.445 --> 00:46:26.305
and they're not gonna be resurrected immediately.

982
00:46:26.305 --> 00:46:27.585
That's coming someday. But,

983
00:46:28.165 --> 00:46:29.785
but he looks at the guy who was

984
00:46:30.335 --> 00:46:31.825
just mocking him a second ago,

985
00:46:31.825 --> 00:46:32.905
and this guy still was mocking him,

986
00:46:32.905 --> 00:46:34.665
but this guy looked at him and said, actually, huh,

987
00:46:35.345 --> 00:46:37.025
I believe some something different about you.

988
00:46:37.025 --> 00:46:39.305
Right? What does he say to him?

989
00:46:39.565 --> 00:46:44.395
He says, you'll be with me in paradise today.

990
00:46:46.255 --> 00:46:49.435
So that phrase, along with a few other scriptures, I have

991
00:46:49.435 --> 00:46:53.395
to look 'em up, but is indicating that there is a state

992
00:46:54.345 --> 00:46:55.995
that isn't sleeping.

993
00:46:56.825 --> 00:47:00.635
Soul sleep is one of the comments made that, well,

994
00:47:00.705 --> 00:47:01.915
anybody either believe

995
00:47:01.915 --> 00:47:04.515
or unbeliever die, they go into this sleep state

996
00:47:05.005 --> 00:47:09.435
until Jesus returns to judge separate, send to heaven

997
00:47:09.455 --> 00:47:10.595
and hell, that kind of thing.

998
00:47:12.575 --> 00:47:14.755
We don't believe that because after Roman,

999
00:47:14.985 --> 00:47:18.195
it's Hebrews 9 27, it's destined for man to die once

1000
00:47:18.195 --> 00:47:19.475
after that to face the judgment.

1001
00:47:20.455 --> 00:47:23.955
Now that teams after that seems to indicate,

1002
00:47:25.125 --> 00:47:28.795
could be any time, but the way it's talked about is an

1003
00:47:28.795 --> 00:47:33.125
urgent, immediate, you're with God or you're not.

1004
00:47:33.705 --> 00:47:35.165
You'll be with me in paradise.

1005
00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:39.445
So there's a measure of the way we talk about heaven

1006
00:47:40.785 --> 00:47:44.805
may not be helpful because the way the Bible talks about is

1007
00:47:44.865 --> 00:47:46.765
new heavens and new earth are coming.

1008
00:47:47.705 --> 00:47:51.885
That's the final state, new heavens and new earth right now.

1009
00:47:53.185 --> 00:47:55.685
Is it heaven per se? Yeah.

1010
00:47:55.795 --> 00:47:57.245
Well, we could say that,

1011
00:47:57.265 --> 00:48:00.245
but the way Jesus said is paradise, you'll be

1012
00:48:00.315 --> 00:48:01.725
with me in paradise.

1013
00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:07.045
So we would say that there is an immediate from death moment

1014
00:48:07.175 --> 00:48:10.605
where your soul, absent the body, the body is still buried.

1015
00:48:11.115 --> 00:48:12.965
Your soul goes to be with God

1016
00:48:13.065 --> 00:48:16.565
or to be in what they call shield

1017
00:48:17.065 --> 00:48:20.845
or Hades, uh, not temporary state,

1018
00:48:20.945 --> 00:48:24.405
but a, a version of

1019
00:48:25.785 --> 00:48:29.805
the end state until Jesus comes back to finalize

1020
00:48:29.805 --> 00:48:31.965
that new heavens new earth lake of fire

1021
00:48:32.555 --> 00:48:34.285
that we saw in Matthew 25.

1022
00:48:34.825 --> 00:48:36.765
So that's the general way we'd understand that.

1023
00:48:36.765 --> 00:48:39.285
Yeah. And, and now, uh, I would also say that, uh,

1024
00:48:39.665 --> 00:48:41.885
the story of the, uh, rich man

1025
00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:46.725
and Lazarus, uh, they say the, uh, Lazarus went to,

1026
00:48:47.595 --> 00:48:49.135
uh, the bosom of Abraham.

1027
00:48:49.315 --> 00:48:50.895
So we call it the paradise.

1028
00:48:51.245 --> 00:48:54.375
Call it, uh, absence of body home with Christ.

1029
00:48:55.075 --> 00:48:56.895
Uh, talk about the bosom of Abraham.

1030
00:48:57.155 --> 00:49:01.015
So it's a state where apparently your spirit is,

1031
00:49:01.015 --> 00:49:03.335
you're connected with uh, Christ,

1032
00:49:03.635 --> 00:49:06.615
but your body isn't reunited until the resurrection.

1033
00:49:06.925 --> 00:49:10.575
Yeah. So it's not exactly heaven if you think about heaven

1034
00:49:10.675 --> 00:49:15.165
as being the, the, uh, recreated heaven, new heavens

1035
00:49:15.165 --> 00:49:18.165
and new earth, which is, uh, we believe physical.

1036
00:49:19.735 --> 00:49:21.025
Yeah. We would also say

1037
00:49:21.095 --> 00:49:23.785
that there's often a comment made about purgatory in

1038
00:49:23.785 --> 00:49:25.305
especially Roman Catholic circles.

1039
00:49:27.005 --> 00:49:28.545
That's nowhere in the Bible,

1040
00:49:29.535 --> 00:49:31.305
because that's where that kind of goes, is

1041
00:49:31.305 --> 00:49:32.385
that there's this interim state.

1042
00:49:32.585 --> 00:49:33.905
I could maybe work my way out of it

1043
00:49:33.905 --> 00:49:37.145
or work my way into like, no, it's fixed.

1044
00:49:37.495 --> 00:49:40.505
What did you do with Jesus while you're alive? Yeah.

1045
00:49:40.505 --> 00:49:42.105
Your body hasn't been resurrected yet.

1046
00:49:42.205 --> 00:49:43.905
You'll be given an eternal body.

1047
00:49:44.255 --> 00:49:46.265
Even those who are unbelievers going

1048
00:49:46.265 --> 00:49:48.225
to hell forever will be given a resurrected

1049
00:49:48.225 --> 00:49:49.305
body that will last forever.

1050
00:49:50.405 --> 00:49:53.905
But there's no way to work your way out of one of the other.

1051
00:49:54.735 --> 00:49:57.265
Once you're there, it's fixed, it's done.

1052
00:49:57.485 --> 00:49:59.625
So, great question though. Yeah. Yeah.

1053
00:50:02.855 --> 00:50:06.995
No indulgences, no indulgences, no, none of that.

1054
00:50:09.455 --> 00:50:10.455
But Jeff,

1055
00:50:10.935 --> 00:50:14.595
So my question, I'm recovering from the left behind series

1056
00:50:14.655 --> 00:50:18.515
as a very terrified at an early age.

1057
00:50:21.475 --> 00:50:24.515
I don't necessarily hold the same views now,

1058
00:50:24.535 --> 00:50:26.955
but my question would be, if we take the rules

1059
00:50:27.105 --> 00:50:31.205
of interpreting scripture, you know, it, for instance,

1060
00:50:31.225 --> 00:50:33.645
it can't mean for us what it didn't mean for them.

1061
00:50:33.745 --> 00:50:35.285
We let scripture interpret scripture.

1062
00:50:36.465 --> 00:50:39.605
How can we reconcile that with like,

1063
00:50:39.835 --> 00:50:42.725
something like the dispensational view, which is very

1064
00:50:43.245 --> 00:50:47.365
prominent, uh, especially in a lot of our churches, uh,

1065
00:50:47.365 --> 00:50:49.045
Baptist churches, and here in Oklahoma.

1066
00:50:49.385 --> 00:50:52.845
How can we reconcile that when so much

1067
00:50:52.845 --> 00:50:57.345
of the dispensational views seems to be focused on, uh,

1068
00:50:58.325 --> 00:51:01.265
how would you put it just like focused on us, you know?

1069
00:51:01.695 --> 00:51:05.185
Yeah. China or Russia is, you know,

1070
00:51:05.955 --> 00:51:07.785
Putin is the antichrist and then,

1071
00:51:08.085 --> 00:51:10.345
or Ronald Reagan used to be the antichrist,

1072
00:51:10.345 --> 00:51:13.465
and then now, you know, it seems to change so much.

1073
00:51:13.565 --> 00:51:15.305
How can we reconcile with that?

1074
00:51:16.005 --> 00:51:19.865
Uh, or should we just say that's probably not true,

1075
00:51:20.565 --> 00:51:22.305
you know, is it healthy to have that?

1076
00:51:22.365 --> 00:51:23.945
Or is it, I don't know. That's

1077
00:51:23.945 --> 00:51:24.945
A good question. Yeah.

1078
00:51:24.945 --> 00:51:25.825
Yeah.

1079
00:51:25.825 --> 00:51:30.625
That, that, that's where we can get serious.

1080
00:51:30.625 --> 00:51:32.585
Got thoughts. Go ahead and repeat, repeat the question.

1081
00:51:32.765 --> 00:51:34.785
So again, I I catch most of it.

1082
00:51:35.255 --> 00:51:40.145
Yeah. So we've got this, um, he's, he's recovering left

1083
00:51:40.145 --> 00:51:44.665
behind this guy, you know, so, um, this idea that

1084
00:51:46.175 --> 00:51:49.155
was so prevalent and prominent in our day is this

1085
00:51:49.155 --> 00:51:51.315
dispensational idea, pre-millennial idea,

1086
00:51:52.295 --> 00:51:54.475
yet it doesn't seem to square with scripture.

1087
00:51:54.775 --> 00:51:56.195
So how do we reconcile that?

1088
00:51:56.295 --> 00:51:58.435
If we, do we just let it kind of sit,

1089
00:51:58.895 --> 00:52:01.395
or do we press into it a little bit more?

1090
00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:05.595
Yeah. I guess what I would say my preference,

1091
00:52:05.695 --> 00:52:09.115
if you wanna call it that, is the pre-millennial, uh,

1092
00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:13.155
pre tribulational, uh, perspective as taught in more

1093
00:52:13.155 --> 00:52:14.515
or less in the Hal Lindsay series.

1094
00:52:15.095 --> 00:52:17.635
Uh, and,

1095
00:52:17.695 --> 00:52:21.795
and there are, uh, reasons to say, well, does

1096
00:52:21.795 --> 00:52:22.915
that exactly fit, does

1097
00:52:22.915 --> 00:52:25.795
that exactly flow the way revelation flows?

1098
00:52:26.275 --> 00:52:29.675
'cause there are things that show up sort of outta sequence

1099
00:52:29.825 --> 00:52:34.235
that, uh, you might say, well,

1100
00:52:34.575 --> 00:52:36.035
you know, there's a lot of things going on

1101
00:52:36.035 --> 00:52:38.595
and you kind of have to patch it together to make the,

1102
00:52:39.685 --> 00:52:42.585
the dispensational plan sort of work out.

1103
00:52:43.485 --> 00:52:47.735
Um, but, uh, I think the, the key is, and,

1104
00:52:47.735 --> 00:52:49.935
and the thing that concerns me about that is

1105
00:52:49.935 --> 00:52:53.055
that people are majoring on prophecy

1106
00:52:53.395 --> 00:52:54.695
and trying

1107
00:52:54.695 --> 00:52:58.985
to become Bible experts on prophecy at the expense of, uh,

1108
00:52:59.385 --> 00:53:02.105
bringing people to Christ, uh, growing them in Christ,

1109
00:53:02.965 --> 00:53:04.465
and, uh, reaching others for Christ.

1110
00:53:04.705 --> 00:53:08.195
'cause that, that's the instruction that was left with us.

1111
00:53:08.615 --> 00:53:11.715
So it's, I'm not so concerned with the,

1112
00:53:14.725 --> 00:53:17.265
not so concerned with, uh, the conclusions

1113
00:53:17.855 --> 00:53:21.105
because you get into the other issue of, okay, is it, uh,

1114
00:53:21.835 --> 00:53:23.455
is the church or place Israel?

1115
00:53:23.555 --> 00:53:26.925
Is it Israel that comes back, uh, a lot of scriptures

1116
00:53:26.925 --> 00:53:30.045
that can be looked at different ways.

1117
00:53:30.185 --> 00:53:31.845
And again, you know, is the next thing

1118
00:53:31.845 --> 00:53:35.605
that happens is Christ come, or for us.

1119
00:53:36.765 --> 00:53:39.505
Uh, and and what I can tell you is, is where I've landed is

1120
00:53:41.645 --> 00:53:44.745
and believe is that the, uh, coming of Christ is imminent.

1121
00:53:46.285 --> 00:53:49.825
And it'll either be in, in my perspective,

1122
00:53:49.955 --> 00:53:51.305
it'll be pre-trib,

1123
00:53:51.305 --> 00:53:54.185
because I think we're gonna recognize those things when they

1124
00:53:54.185 --> 00:53:57.875
happen that happen in the tribulation, or it'll be il

1125
00:53:59.455 --> 00:54:02.955
but the thing is that Christ is coming.

1126
00:54:03.175 --> 00:54:05.115
That's the, that's the next thing that's gonna happen.

1127
00:54:05.225 --> 00:54:07.435
It's imminent. It can happen at any time.

1128
00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.865
It could also have happened at any time

1129
00:54:13.035 --> 00:54:16.965
when the New Testament was being written 2000 years ago,

1130
00:54:17.585 --> 00:54:19.485
and it could be 2000 years from now.

1131
00:54:20.145 --> 00:54:22.405
And so to, to get off track

1132
00:54:22.625 --> 00:54:26.325
and say, uh, we're gonna camp out on the hill

1133
00:54:26.565 --> 00:54:29.445
'cause we, we know what, what day it's gonna be.

1134
00:54:30.725 --> 00:54:33.405
Scripture clearly tells us to be ready.

1135
00:54:34.625 --> 00:54:37.885
And Jesus said he didn't, father hadn't even told him,

1136
00:54:38.625 --> 00:54:39.685
uh, when he's coming back.

1137
00:54:40.905 --> 00:54:45.625
But I think that sort of the lesson for us, uh, is that, uh,

1138
00:54:46.375 --> 00:54:49.265
here at Henderson Hills, we wanna have a big tent

1139
00:54:49.265 --> 00:54:51.385
with respect to last things.

1140
00:54:51.435 --> 00:54:56.035
There are things

1141
00:54:56.105 --> 00:54:58.995
that have to be true to be biblical,

1142
00:54:59.855 --> 00:55:01.955
and we don't need to divide over

1143
00:55:02.485 --> 00:55:04.875
which camp we get into.

1144
00:55:06.725 --> 00:55:09.535
Yeah. Yeah. And I would just in light

1145
00:55:09.535 --> 00:55:12.975
of your question about kinda where, what do we do with it?

1146
00:55:13.715 --> 00:55:16.735
Um, the true dispensational,

1147
00:55:17.175 --> 00:55:19.735
pre-trib premil thought process didn't really show up

1148
00:55:19.735 --> 00:55:20.815
until the late 18 hundreds.

1149
00:55:21.765 --> 00:55:23.655
Doesn't make us wrong. Right?

1150
00:55:23.895 --> 00:55:25.455
I mean, church was wrong in some

1151
00:55:25.455 --> 00:55:26.735
ways for a really long time.

1152
00:55:26.955 --> 00:55:30.175
So it doesn't make it wrong that it's new, uh,

1153
00:55:30.235 --> 00:55:32.135
but it does cause us to think, alright, let's,

1154
00:55:32.135 --> 00:55:34.975
let's make sure we're not just considering this from a

1155
00:55:34.975 --> 00:55:36.895
Western American perspective

1156
00:55:37.165 --> 00:55:39.215
that just makes it about me all the time.

1157
00:55:39.215 --> 00:55:42.695
That I want comfort and no suffering, uh,

1158
00:55:42.695 --> 00:55:44.215
because the Bible's full of it

1159
00:55:44.675 --> 00:55:46.415
and just says, this is, you're gonna go

1160
00:55:46.415 --> 00:55:47.735
through really hard times, it's gonna get worse.

1161
00:55:47.795 --> 00:55:50.975
Things like that. So I think that's where, like Joe said,

1162
00:55:50.975 --> 00:55:52.095
just handle it carefully.

1163
00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:55.935
Big tent. Um, this should be a sand issue

1164
00:55:55.965 --> 00:55:57.335
that we can sit in the same room,

1165
00:55:57.725 --> 00:55:59.375
same conversation about this

1166
00:55:59.395 --> 00:56:02.295
and say, yeah, I'm historic prem mill, right?

1167
00:56:02.495 --> 00:56:04.215
I, I believe we're gonna go through tribulation

1168
00:56:04.315 --> 00:56:06.695
and here's what this is, and I'm gonna over here.

1169
00:56:06.695 --> 00:56:08.855
I'm, I'm all mill. You know, I think we're in the middle

1170
00:56:08.855 --> 00:56:10.095
of it right now and it's fine.

1171
00:56:10.115 --> 00:56:12.735
And okay, praise God, Jesus coming back. Yep.

1172
00:56:12.735 --> 00:56:16.095
Alright, let's go. So that's what we can get to, I think.

1173
00:56:16.195 --> 00:56:19.375
But, but it does make sense for us to really stop

1174
00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:21.135
and analyze everything.

1175
00:56:21.135 --> 00:56:22.455
Like, like Steve said, everything

1176
00:56:22.455 --> 00:56:24.405
that we've grown up hearing

1177
00:56:25.975 --> 00:56:27.625
doesn't mean we question everything.

1178
00:56:27.765 --> 00:56:30.825
It just means we say, maybe that's not as

1179
00:56:31.585 --> 00:56:32.905
straight line biblical as I thought it was.

1180
00:56:32.905 --> 00:56:34.305
Maybe I need to really just do my

1181
00:56:34.305 --> 00:56:35.345
own research and think through.

1182
00:56:35.365 --> 00:56:37.345
And so that's part of showing those five different options.

1183
00:56:37.345 --> 00:56:38.825
Maybe you've never seen some of those before.

1184
00:56:39.205 --> 00:56:41.385
You're like, oh, that makes a little sense too.

1185
00:56:42.285 --> 00:56:44.025
Oh, they, yeah. 'cause they all kind of do

1186
00:56:44.045 --> 00:56:46.145
and there's enough scriptures to back all of them up.

1187
00:56:46.725 --> 00:56:48.185
We need to be careful with them. Yeah.

1188
00:56:48.375 --> 00:56:49.825
Have nothing against Kirk. Cameron.

1189
00:56:50.625 --> 00:56:53.385
Kirk Cameron's a great guy. We love Kirk. Yes.

1190
00:56:53.605 --> 00:56:56.225
Uh, that's awesome. Yeah.

1191
00:56:57.135 --> 00:57:01.345
Okay. So, uh, there are those who say that, uh,

1192
00:57:01.905 --> 00:57:06.025
prophecy in the Bible makes up anywhere from 25

1193
00:57:06.725 --> 00:57:10.785
to 33% of the scriptures in the Bible.

1194
00:57:11.605 --> 00:57:13.145
So what,

1195
00:57:14.175 --> 00:57:17.705
what do we think, uh, the point?

1196
00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:21.745
Why did God put those prophecies in there?

1197
00:57:21.925 --> 00:57:23.025
That's one thing,

1198
00:57:24.765 --> 00:57:29.545
and my personal opinion is that, uh, prophecy,

1199
00:57:30.245 --> 00:57:33.705
uh, makes the Bible the most unusual book,

1200
00:57:34.065 --> 00:57:36.025
particularly when we look at the ones

1201
00:57:36.025 --> 00:57:37.625
that have been fulfilled.

1202
00:57:37.735 --> 00:57:42.195
Yeah. You talked about, uh,

1203
00:57:42.755 --> 00:57:44.275
focusing so much on prophecy

1204
00:57:44.305 --> 00:57:46.835
that we essentially forget the gospel.

1205
00:57:48.415 --> 00:57:52.355
But to me, as I, as I have read

1206
00:57:52.355 --> 00:57:54.195
through the scriptures many times,

1207
00:57:56.775 --> 00:58:01.485
there are things happening today that, um,

1208
00:58:04.385 --> 00:58:08.075
look like they could be setting up

1209
00:58:09.215 --> 00:58:12.115
for the final fulfillment that are left,

1210
00:58:12.385 --> 00:58:13.755
that remain to be fulfilled.

1211
00:58:14.295 --> 00:58:18.835
So the point being, our time

1212
00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:23.995
may be short, it could be 200 years away, two or whatever.

1213
00:58:25.455 --> 00:58:28.875
But the honest truth is not a single one

1214
00:58:28.875 --> 00:58:30.555
of us know the number of our days.

1215
00:58:31.415 --> 00:58:35.875
So that makes it imperative to,

1216
00:58:36.695 --> 00:58:38.195
we can talk about prophecy,

1217
00:58:38.215 --> 00:58:41.915
but we have to get to the message of the gospel,

1218
00:58:42.125 --> 00:58:44.835
which is there is not a single

1219
00:58:45.515 --> 00:58:47.635
innocent human being on the face of the earth.

1220
00:58:48.405 --> 00:58:52.795
We're all sinners. A judgment is coming. Yeah.

1221
00:58:52.935 --> 00:58:54.755
Are you prepared for it? That's right.

1222
00:58:55.495 --> 00:58:57.955
That's Right. But back to the initial question,

1223
00:58:58.975 --> 00:59:01.355
why was prophecy put in the word?

1224
00:59:03.225 --> 00:59:04.515
Yeah, that, that's a good question.

1225
00:59:04.635 --> 00:59:06.795
I think there's, there's a lot of, um,

1226
00:59:07.795 --> 00:59:09.475
warnings that come with it.

1227
00:59:10.025 --> 00:59:13.755
When you think about even Paul in, in his letters would,

1228
00:59:13.755 --> 00:59:17.515
would warn Christians not to fall away.

1229
00:59:18.015 --> 00:59:20.795
Mm-Hmm. And, and so in the same, in the same letter,

1230
00:59:20.985 --> 00:59:22.885
he says, thank you for your faithfulness.

1231
00:59:23.025 --> 00:59:26.525
I'm so proud of you for staying steadfast. Don't fall away.

1232
00:59:28.125 --> 00:59:30.695
That doesn't how, wait, how did you get there, Paul?

1233
00:59:30.695 --> 00:59:32.175
Like, they aren't falling away,

1234
00:59:32.475 --> 00:59:35.535
but I think he's saying to them, stay alert,

1235
00:59:37.345 --> 00:59:40.255
which would be part of what the prophetic language

1236
00:59:40.905 --> 00:59:43.855
about judgment and all that it, it is coming

1237
00:59:44.675 --> 00:59:45.895
how we, we could debate.

1238
00:59:45.995 --> 00:59:49.015
But, but I think that's enough of the warning there to say

1239
00:59:49.115 --> 00:59:50.855
to unbelievers even

1240
00:59:52.395 --> 00:59:55.015
and to us, don't fall away.

1241
00:59:56.415 --> 00:59:59.005
Don't stay steadfast and to an unbeliever.

1242
00:59:59.675 --> 01:00:02.485
This is coming and it's going

1243
01:00:02.485 --> 01:00:04.125
to be worse than you can ever imagine.

1244
01:00:05.585 --> 01:00:10.375
So see the opportunity of, like you said,

1245
01:00:10.575 --> 01:00:11.895
tying the gospel with it to say,

1246
01:00:12.355 --> 01:00:14.575
and part of the prophecy is that he predicted.

1247
01:00:14.575 --> 01:00:16.535
So you're reading Daniel and Ezekiel,

1248
01:00:16.535 --> 01:00:20.495
and there's this lament and woe is us and judgment's coming,

1249
01:00:21.315 --> 01:00:23.375
but he also looked forward to a savior.

1250
01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:27.495
Yeah. And that prophecy was fulfilled.

1251
01:00:27.495 --> 01:00:30.415
There is, there is hope. 300 plus times different

1252
01:00:30.415 --> 01:00:32.655
things were fulfilled in that baby coming.

1253
01:00:34.075 --> 01:00:36.415
So don't you think you can trust

1254
01:00:36.415 --> 01:00:38.015
that there is a judgment coming too?

1255
01:00:39.525 --> 01:00:40.995
Maybe you need to consider this savior

1256
01:00:41.215 --> 01:00:44.275
who spares you from judgment by taking it on himself.

1257
01:00:44.295 --> 01:00:46.435
That's the where you get the gospel with that. Yeah. Yeah.

1258
01:00:46.495 --> 01:00:48.235
So some warning to us, uh,

1259
01:00:48.235 --> 01:00:50.955
because we can tend to get comfortable, we can really,

1260
01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:55.035
as believers we can, walking away, that just gets lazy.

1261
01:00:55.615 --> 01:00:57.995
And so the warnings of prophecy

1262
01:00:58.015 --> 01:00:59.035
and even the letters,

1263
01:00:59.385 --> 01:01:02.115
Hebrews talks a lot about warning believers.

1264
01:01:02.145 --> 01:01:05.275
Like we need to be careful and alert.

1265
01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:09.075
I have a niece who, uh, is not a believer,

1266
01:01:09.255 --> 01:01:11.835
and I asked her if she would share with me

1267
01:01:12.975 --> 01:01:15.755
why she no longer believed.

1268
01:01:16.695 --> 01:01:21.115
And I am in the process of preparing a response.

1269
01:01:21.815 --> 01:01:23.715
She, I had asked her several weeks ago,

1270
01:01:23.895 --> 01:01:25.675
she finally responded today.

1271
01:01:26.655 --> 01:01:31.475
And I think prophecy fulfilled certainly helps

1272
01:01:32.275 --> 01:01:37.015
validate the truth that's contained in God's word.

1273
01:01:38.775 --> 01:01:40.195
Um, and it make,

1274
01:01:40.255 --> 01:01:42.275
it does make it different from any other book

1275
01:01:42.275 --> 01:01:47.155
because many of these prophecies were for foretold hundreds

1276
01:01:47.535 --> 01:01:49.515
of years, if not thousands

1277
01:01:49.515 --> 01:01:52.915
before they eventually were fulfilled.

1278
01:01:53.545 --> 01:01:56.755
That makes it a very unique book

1279
01:01:57.095 --> 01:02:01.475
and provides validity for it. Yeah.

1280
01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:05.545
Yeah. The, uh, just real quick, one

1281
01:02:05.545 --> 01:02:07.385
of the resources we had, it says the second coming

1282
01:02:07.385 --> 01:02:11.905
of Christ is mentioned 1,845 times in the Bible,

1283
01:02:11.905 --> 01:02:15.865
1,527 in the Old Testament, 318 in the New Testament.

1284
01:02:16.325 --> 01:02:18.185
And people are exhorted over 50 times

1285
01:02:18.325 --> 01:02:19.685
to be ready for his return.

1286
01:02:20.625 --> 01:02:23.685
So just by counting Yeah. That, that's a

1287
01:02:23.685 --> 01:02:24.685
Lot. That's a lot. Yeah.

1288
01:02:24.685 --> 01:02:27.445
So it is absolutely important.

1289
01:02:27.445 --> 01:02:29.925
We gotta, we gotta be done. But it is absolutely important.

1290
01:02:31.855 --> 01:02:36.015
Don't let it consume us by focusing so

1291
01:02:36.155 --> 01:02:40.935
and exclusively on it that we lose the bigger picture

1292
01:02:42.005 --> 01:02:46.295
that Christ is, the victor already has one will win.

1293
01:02:47.545 --> 01:02:50.445
We stand in victory, in triumph in him

1294
01:02:52.225 --> 01:02:53.365
and stay steadfast.

1295
01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:54.725
Yeah. Just, just till that thought.

1296
01:02:55.195 --> 01:02:58.825
Yeah. Uh, we are entering the end times.

1297
01:02:59.525 --> 01:03:02.905
We entered the end times when Christ arose

1298
01:03:03.085 --> 01:03:04.905
2000 years ago, uh, 2000 years ago.

1299
01:03:04.965 --> 01:03:05.985
So we've been in the end times,

1300
01:03:06.045 --> 01:03:08.505
and it could very well be that those signs

1301
01:03:08.505 --> 01:03:12.265
that are happening now are the signs of, of the coming, uh,

1302
01:03:12.265 --> 01:03:14.065
tribulation and things are setting up.

1303
01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:17.785
But let's don't forget that, uh,

1304
01:03:18.325 --> 01:03:21.465
in the year 99, 99, I'll tell you,

1305
01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.545
there was a pretty big bunch of folks who

1306
01:03:25.875 --> 01:03:29.885
Were waiting for the millennium to start the year 1000.

1307
01:03:30.175 --> 01:03:32.205
Right. And, uh, they were way disappointed.

1308
01:03:32.205 --> 01:03:33.805
They weren't taking care of business

1309
01:03:34.635 --> 01:03:37.215
and living their lives for Christ and reaching people.

1310
01:03:37.995 --> 01:03:41.985
Uh, and if I have a concern about the, uh,

1311
01:03:43.935 --> 01:03:47.195
dispensational, if you call it, I call it the pre-trib,

1312
01:03:47.455 --> 01:03:51.515
pre-millennial perspective, is that we have people who are

1313
01:03:51.535 --> 01:03:52.955
so convinced that this is it,

1314
01:03:53.505 --> 01:03:55.435
that they're patting themselves on the back,

1315
01:03:55.435 --> 01:03:56.715
that they're good, we're good.

1316
01:03:57.415 --> 01:03:59.475
Uh, aren't we smart? That we know so much about it.

1317
01:03:59.615 --> 01:04:02.715
And we can talk about, you know, whether Gog and Mago

1318
01:04:02.735 --> 01:04:03.875
or China

1319
01:04:04.055 --> 01:04:06.675
or the armies from the East 200 million

1320
01:04:07.575 --> 01:04:09.435
man army from the East is China.

1321
01:04:09.615 --> 01:04:11.195
You know, now they've got that many people in

1322
01:04:11.195 --> 01:04:12.955
their military.

1323
01:04:13.175 --> 01:04:17.605
So you get so wrapped up in it that, uh,

1324
01:04:17.905 --> 01:04:21.045
it takes your eye off the ball of what we're to be about

1325
01:04:21.145 --> 01:04:23.405
and living the Christian life, maturing in Christ,

1326
01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:25.605
helping others ma mature in Christ and loving them.

1327
01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:29.085
Yeah. So that's, that's the only caution I have. And it's

1328
01:04:29.105 --> 01:04:30.105
Good's. Good. Thank

1329
01:04:30.105 --> 01:04:31.885
you for that. Steve. You got one more thing?

1330
01:04:31.885 --> 01:04:33.045
And then pray for us if you would please.

1331
01:04:33.245 --> 01:04:36.365
A final word is that it just, the song, the King is Coming

1332
01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:39.205
by Bill and Gloria Gaither just keeps ringing in my mind.

1333
01:04:39.925 --> 01:04:41.645
'cause I was sitting at the Baptist Temple Church.

1334
01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:44.765
We'd just sing. The King is Coming and we had the big Tempe,

1335
01:04:44.945 --> 01:04:47.165
and we'd play that Tempe and there would be tears

1336
01:04:47.585 --> 01:04:48.645
and there'd be excitement.

1337
01:04:48.905 --> 01:04:52.845
And so I'll just say, uh, the king is coming. Let's pray.

1338
01:04:53.945 --> 01:04:55.085
You gonna sing it for us first?

1339
01:04:55.085 --> 01:04:56.325
No. Well, no, I won't. Oh man.

1340
01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:57.565
They'll not let me in the quiet

1341
01:04:57.755 --> 01:04:58.755
Open. That was coming.

1342
01:04:58.755 --> 01:04:59.405
Oh,

1343
01:05:00.165 --> 01:05:01.805
Heavenly Father, thank you for tonight.

1344
01:05:01.825 --> 01:05:03.925
And just thank you for the opportunity to be together.

1345
01:05:04.185 --> 01:05:07.085
Uh, I appreciate each person here tonight,

1346
01:05:07.265 --> 01:05:09.125
and I thank you for, for John

1347
01:05:09.125 --> 01:05:10.725
as he led us through these questions.

1348
01:05:10.825 --> 01:05:13.285
And as he, uh, continues to teach us, Lord,

1349
01:05:13.665 --> 01:05:14.925
uh, the king is coming.

1350
01:05:15.425 --> 01:05:17.365
And, uh, let us be prepared.

1351
01:05:17.545 --> 01:05:20.885
Let us, uh, let us continue to share the gospel.

1352
01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:23.925
Every opportunity that we have, let us love one another.

1353
01:05:24.135 --> 01:05:26.605
Let's make disciples of, of people

1354
01:05:26.635 --> 01:05:29.125
that we have the opportunity to come into contact with.

1355
01:05:29.495 --> 01:05:31.125
Thank you for the blessed hope.

1356
01:05:31.735 --> 01:05:33.365
Thank you for everything you do for us.

1357
01:05:33.665 --> 01:05:36.445
Go, go with us tonight and keep us safe.

1358
01:05:36.555 --> 01:05:37.885
Your name I pray. Amen.

1359
01:05:38.315 --> 01:05:40.485
Amen. Amen. Good, good, good.
