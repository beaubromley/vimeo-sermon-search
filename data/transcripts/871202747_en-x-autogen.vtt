1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, I'm Phil Slee,

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.250
the pastor of Discipleship and Community here at Henderson Hills Baptist Church,

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.490
and we are completing our, uh,

4
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.450
community group certification training with looking at the community group

5
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.890
administration coordinator.

6
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.570
Now in the busy life of a community group between the Bible lessons every week

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.330
and the, uh, class or outreach social events, uh,

8
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.370
a quiet yet indispensable role often goes unnoticed,

9
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.050
and that's of the community outreach coordinator.

10
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.730
And their responsibilities might just seem mundane to some,

11
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.650
but the importance of this role cannot be overstated.

12
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.290
We're gonna look at three things real quickly,

13
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.530
the big biblical precedence in accuracy and record keeping,

14
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.210
and also we'll look at the, uh,

15
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.530
community group administration coordinator as the unsung hero of the group.

16
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.690
And then lastly,

17
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.490
we're gonna look at some of the duties of the community group administration

18
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.570
coordinator. First of all,

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.410
let's look at the biblical precedence accuracy in record keeping.

20
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.530
Now we're gonna draw on the biblical inspiration and examples of numbers.

21
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.530
And first and second Chronicles.

22
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.330
We're not going to be reading much from those passages because these are long

23
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.690
lists of lineage and names and locations and lands and boundaries

24
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.250
and that, but it's a beautiful example of meticulous record keeping.

25
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.290
The book of numbers is an importance because it's, uh,

26
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.810
it keeps meticulous records of the Israelite community.

27
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.970
It details their senses and their genealogies and their land boundaries.

28
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.610
But it's more important than that because we know that God records the work, uh,

29
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.010
his work through his people and his promises,

30
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.850
and the covenant covenants that he's made. Uh,

31
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.530
the countless lists of names and family heritage reminds us

32
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.290
that these names are historical facts. These are real people.

33
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.690
And the practice of meticulous record keeping not only insured organizational

34
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.250
efficiency,

35
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.810
but it reflected the significance of individual responsibilities within the

36
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.210
larger Israeli community. And in First and Second Chronicles,

37
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.850
we witnessed the chronicling of David's lineage and the history of Israel as it

38
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.210
pointed forwards to the coming Messiah.

39
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.690
These books highlight the value of preserving the past and ensuring

40
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.330
the future generations would be grounded in their spiritual heritage and God's

41
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.010
promises and even warnings.

42
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.330
So an accurate record keeping in this context was literally an act of obedience

43
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.010
to God's commands and a testament to the importance of preserving

44
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.650
the heritage, the legacy, the history of God's covenant community.

45
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.610
So number two,

46
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.730
let's look at the community group administration lead as an unsung hero. Um,

47
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.690
they provide what I consider to be the administrative backbone.

48
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.770
And just as record keeping was pivotal in the Old Testament,

49
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.530
the community group administration coordinator plays a vital role in maintaining

50
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.090
the administrative foundation for the class. Uh,

51
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.760
attendance records and reports ensure that the class runs smoothly

52
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.520
and efficiently. And when they do that,

53
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.720
you'll see that there is personal connection.

54
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.480
The administrative leave often interacts closely with the community group

55
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.360
leadership team, uh, and the, uh,

56
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.760
discipleship and community staff in the church office.

57
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.880
They provide accurate attendance records so that group members can be tracked,

58
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.680
their engagement or their disengagement can be addressed. The administration,

59
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.870
uh,

60
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.240
coordinator supplies new information and corrects information so that the

61
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.440
director and the prayer coordinator and the teacher and the Henderson Hills

62
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.480
Baptist Church office can accurately communicate with everyone

63
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.413
on the role.

64
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.400
The administration lead provides the accurate contact information so that, uh,

65
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.120
the, uh, the purposes of the community group can be, uh,

66
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.400
met precisely in the lives of every person on the role.

67
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.520
So this allows for a deeper sense of community and personal connection,

68
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.520
and provides an avenue for the class to support and uplift one another in times

69
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.520
of crisis. And that brings us to the final piece here in that spiritual nursing,

70
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.320
uh, spiritual nurturing, similar to how the, uh,

71
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.720
accurate records in the Old Testament numbers in First and second Chronicles,

72
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.760
how they preserved spiritual heritage of Israel.

73
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.840
The Community Group administration coordinator contributes to the spiritual

74
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.840
nourishment of each class member,

75
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.520
how By recording attendance and contact information,

76
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.280
they create a treasure trove of data that can be utilized by the other community

77
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.600
group members for prayer, or for ministry, or for serving opportunities.

78
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.960
Uh, the list goes on and on,

79
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.880
not just teaching on Sunday morning and keeping a track of attendance,

80
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.600
but also being prepared to minister when a community group member needs us most.

81
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.320
So let's look at a few lessons from Biblical record keeping. Uh, first of all,

82
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.040
obedience and accountability. In the Old Testament,

83
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.800
meticulous record keeping was literally an act of obedience to God.

84
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.880
In a similar way, the role of the community group administrator lead, uh,

85
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.640
it involves commitment to serving with diligence and accountability,

86
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.280
and recognizing that their contributions are a part of a larger spiritual

87
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.360
journey. So, uh, record,

88
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.200
accurate record keeping within the community group context is paramount for a

89
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.800
multitude of reasons. Let's look at a few. First of all,

90
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.800
planning and evaluation.

91
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.880
You've heard some say that without planning,

92
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.120
then there's no plan to succeed.

93
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.360
And so what we're going to learn is that planning serves as a foundation. Uh,

94
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.240
accurate records serve as a foundation for decision making and strategic

95
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.240
planning through precise records. Um, community Group can track its attendance,

96
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.600
its activities, it's projects, it's initiatives,

97
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.200
and that allows the community group leaders to identify what works and what

98
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.640
doesn't, uh, what we can do that seems to be, uh,

99
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.030
resulting in fruitfulness and what we can do that seems to be resulting in

100
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.640
disengagement or apathy.

101
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.520
Accurate records set a roadmap for the future.

102
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.240
It helps the allocation of resources, not just financial resources,

103
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.880
but energy resources, and it helps prioritize the efforts of the team.

104
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.720
Moreover, records are essential for accountability and transparency.

105
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.680
They provide a detailed account of how we can be good stewards

106
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.360
of the funds that God has entrusted to us, and how resources are allocated.

107
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.960
And it's crucial for building trust among members and stakeholders. Uh,

108
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.080
every community group member is a stakeholder in the future development of that

109
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.920
group. And so when they're involved, when they're engaged,

110
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.760
then we know what we are doing for the purpose of God's glory is effective.

111
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.560
Number two, let's look at the metrics and analysis. In addition,

112
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.920
accurate record keeping is instrumental in identifying metrics for evaluation.

113
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.880
By meticulously documenting the group's attendance and activities and

114
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.153
participation data,

115
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.360
it becomes possible to measure the impact and effective effectiveness of the

116
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.280
group. Uh,

117
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.680
this data-driven approach allows community group members to refine their

118
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.440
strategies and optimize their resources for maximum impact. Um, uh,

119
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.480
I can look at a graph of attendance and see, uh,

120
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.040
what is the trajectory of the group. As,

121
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.720
as can any of the leaders in the leadership group.

122
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.080
And perhaps the most important piece of the, uh,

123
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.720
administrator coordinator's role is chasing the strays with, uh,

124
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.040
chasing the strays is just a, uh, uh,

125
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.120
it's a euphemism for how do we contact those who seem to be disengaging

126
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.680
Without your rec, uh, accurate records,

127
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.880
there's a risk of unintentionally losing people,

128
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.640
people falling through the cracks.

129
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.960
Individuals who have participated in events could be, uh,

130
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.840
overlooked if their involvement's not properly accounted for. If they miss, uh,

131
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.080
three or four Sundays and no one contacts 'em, um,

132
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.760
then the community group has missed the opportunity to provide support when

133
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.480
perhaps the group member needs the most ultimately hindering the group's

134
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.240
mission and potential for making positive change for the glory of God. So,

135
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.600
in essence, accurate record keeping not only bolsters the group decision making

136
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.473
capabilities,

137
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.800
but it also ensures that no community group member is left behind.

138
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.720
And in doing so, uh, you literally are providing for a spiritual legacy,

139
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.880
just as in First and Second Chronicles preserve the lineage and history of

140
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.660
Israel.

141
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.480
The work of the community Group administration coordinator contributes to the

142
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.160
preservation of the class's spiritual history,

143
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.640
the legacy of what God is doing and what God has done.

144
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.320
These records capture moments of God's revelation through teaching

145
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.320
transformation through application and obedience and growth,

146
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.800
not just numerical growth, but spiritual growth in the life of each believer.

147
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.240
Which leads us to the final piece here. And that is unity and community.

148
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.320
Uh, accurate records keeping with the, uh,

149
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.160
in line with the Old Testament book of numbers fosters a sense of historical

150
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.720
reliability. Uh,

151
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.480
numbers literally documents the growth and success and traverse and,

152
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.560
uh, trajectory of, uh, God's nation. Similarly,

153
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.720
the administration coordinator's role promotes unity within the community group

154
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.920
by ensuring that everyone is accounted for, all needs are addressed,

155
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.920
and every member feels valued and connected.

156
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.600
And in a world that often prioritizes the grand and the visible,

157
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.760
the role of the community group, mem uh,

158
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.440
administration coordinator stands as a humble,

159
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.440
yet vital contributor to the spiritual growth and com and unity of the community

160
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.040
group. So, drawing on the inspiration from these biblical examples,

161
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:51.120
we see that this role is not nearly, uh, not merely about administrative tasks,

162
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.440
but also about obedience and spiritual nursing and preserving the heritage

163
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.920
of the Faith community group. So,

164
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.360
just as the Old Testament emphasizes significance of accurate record keeping,

165
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.880
the community group administration administer, uh,

166
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.680
administrator plays a unique and essential part in building a

167
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.480
strong and vibrant spiritual community group.

168
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.840
So let's conclude our time together by looking at the duties of a community

169
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.120
group administration coordinator. First of all, uh,

170
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.720
the thing they do every week is that they prepare and complete the community

171
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.200
group role, and they do so using the community group church builder,

172
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.320
uh, application, this is a, uh,

173
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.240
mobile device application where you literally can use your device, your phone,

174
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.960
if you will, or tablet,

175
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.880
and you can keep track while you're looking in real time at these folks. And,

176
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.840
uh, you're looking for who's attending and who's not attending. Uh,

177
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.640
most of you have already received, uh, an email that looks kind of like this.

178
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.520
And, and it defaults to the fact that you did not meet.

179
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.760
You're not going to receive this email at, uh, at an, uh,

180
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200
a time that's not planned.

181
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.680
You'll receive this email every week at the exact same time,

182
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.760
and if you don't respond to it, it looks right here, it says, did not meet.

183
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.880
And we know that there, that there's a, a better answer than that.

184
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.440
So what you do is you click on record attendance,

185
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.480
then you go and you record who's there and who's not there every week.

186
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.520
Another thing you do is you look for guests, you introduce yourself,

187
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.320
you welcome them to the class, you make them feel at home,

188
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.760
and then you introduce them to other leaders and other people in the class.

189
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.560
And then maybe one of the most important things you can,

190
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.400
things you can do is you can ask them if they have filled out a profile on the

191
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.440
database. A lot of people don't know this,

192
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.320
but at Henderson Hills Baptist Church using the com Church Community Builder,

193
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.080
c c b application, we have, but one database, all guests,

194
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.040
whether they visited once or many times, including all members,

195
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.880
are all a part of the same database.

196
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:58.200
That means that we can ensure every guest's name and every member's name

197
00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.093
and phone number,

198
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.880
and all pertinent data is in one file that is protected.

199
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.160
And, uh, with, with, uh, state-of-the-art redundancy,

200
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.920
we're not going to lose track of this. And, uh, so what you're doing is,

201
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.640
is you're putting them in a system that, uh, not only is, uh, secure and safe,

202
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.840
but you're making that, that data available for, uh,

203
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.200
all levels of database inquiry.

204
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.600
And so you are the foot soldiers and you're, uh, including that data at the, uh,

205
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.760
at the foot soldier level.

206
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.440
But then there will be other levels of accountability and responsibility that

207
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.760
are gonna help us, uh,

208
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.720
communicate with and respond to needs to those people who come to our church,

209
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.880
whether they're members or not. So, uh, you direct people towards,

210
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.040
this is another thing, uh, that you do.

211
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.520
You direct new people towards enrolling in the community group.

212
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.240
A lot of people don't know this,

213
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.360
but you can belong to a community group and not belong to the church as an

214
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.880
official member. In fact,

215
00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.240
community group involvement is a step in the direction towards church

216
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.320
membership. Uh, I said this in a previous training,

217
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.920
but if three different guests come to your community group,

218
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.760
they're not church members, in fact, they're not yet believers in Jesus Christ,

219
00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.480
if they'll come and belong to the community group,

220
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.560
one of those three within the year is going to come to faith in Christ,

221
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.480
join the church, and be baptized.

222
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.680
It's an amazing opportunity for us to recognize that God can use our community

223
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.080
group to draw people to his, his ultimate family, the spiritual family.

224
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.480
So you enroll guests in the community group,

225
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.520
you add their names to the class roster,

226
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.680
which means they'll be included in community group communications.

227
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.680
Their birthdays and their anniversaries will be recognized.

228
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.320
We'll be able to celebrate with them,

229
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.440
and that's gonna make them feel a part of the larger whole. And, uh,

230
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.160
the another thing that you do is you keep class membership and,

231
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.800
and information current and correct, uh, children's names and birthdays,

232
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.520
of course, address, telephone, email, all of these,

233
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.640
the communication points are very important that we keep them updated and

234
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:07.360
corrected. And, and a way that you can do that is also through this, uh,

235
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.680
app. Uh, some of you don't use this, but some of you just do, um,

236
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.400
uh, attendance records, but there are four other opportunities, event notes,

237
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.760
prayer, uh, prayer and prayer request,

238
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.680
and people information where you can report, uh,

239
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.920
you can actually send with a click of a button,

240
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.520
an email to everyone on your roster,

241
00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.320
and you can update them about events that are coming up about different

242
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.800
celebration, birthdays and anniversaries. But, uh, and this key,

243
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.120
this piece right here, people in information is key. Uh,

244
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.120
you will have an opportunity to, uh,

245
00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:46.120
report that the guest data here, if they're not in the database,

246
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.000
if they are, all you need is their name.

247
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.840
And it's probably important to get their permission

248
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.640
To, to, uh, to publicize their information to the community group.

249
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.320
If you don't have that, just put their name.

250
00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.160
But what's happening there is when you use this resource,

251
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.640
it all flows into the exact same database and then it's protected with

252
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.680
redundancy. And it's also shared with the, uh,

253
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.160
with the pastoral community at the, uh,

254
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.720
staff here so that we can contact them as well.

255
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.000
They'll get an email from Pastor John himself. They'll get a,

256
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.360
a phone call or a text from someone in the community in discipleship ministry.

257
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.080
And so what you see is,

258
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.000
is that it's a combined effort from our church to show someone that if they gave

259
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
their information,

260
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.760
that we wanna follow through and let them know that here at Henderson Hills,

261
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.640
you are loved and cared for and valued. Well there, uh,

262
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.840
I want you to hear me say this in conclusion, that,

263
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.800
that you're much more than just a secretary,

264
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.480
much more than just a pencil pusher. Uh, we don't use pencils,

265
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.920
we don't use paper as much anymore.

266
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.000
But what we do is we know the importance of a meticulous attention to

267
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.720
detail as it pertains to the data and information of people who have entrusted

268
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.600
their time with us. And in doing so,

269
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.840
we show them that they're valued and in and, uh,

270
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.920
ultimately to point them to the Lord God, through his son, Jesus Christ.
