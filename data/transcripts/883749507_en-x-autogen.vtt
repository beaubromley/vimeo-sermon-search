1
00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:11.085
If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things

2
00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:12.805
that are above where Christ is

3
00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:14.605
seated at the right hand of God.

4
00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:20.685
Set your minds on things that are above,

5
00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:22.885
not on things that are on earth

6
00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:29.085
For you have died and your life is hidden

7
00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:30.725
with Christ in God.

8
00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:36.205
When Christ who is your life appears,

9
00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:38.125
then you will also appear with him.

10
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:39.125
And,

11
00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:04.965
Well, my name's John. I'm

12
00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:06.935
one of the pastors of Henderson Hills.

13
00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:08.295
And so if you're new, we're grateful

14
00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:09.935
that you'd choose to be with us today.

15
00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:11.815
We know it's not a small step

16
00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:14.615
to take adventure into a new church family,

17
00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:16.055
and so we are glad you're here.

18
00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:17.975
I want to just acknowledge that and,

19
00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:19.735
and ask for you to introduce yourself to us

20
00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:21.415
so we can help you connect as best we can

21
00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:22.575
towards those ends.

22
00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:26.935
We're almost at the finish line in our semester long journey

23
00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:30.655
through the Apostle Paul's letter to the Colossian Church.

24
00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:34.855
And next week we'll be the end of it. So I'm dressing up.

25
00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:36.895
I don't know if you are with me or not, that's up to you.

26
00:01:37.035 --> 00:01:40.295
But, uh, we will enjoy the end of it.

27
00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:41.655
But today we're just gonna be in five

28
00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:43.055
verses of chapter four.

29
00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:45.015
So turn there in God's word with me.

30
00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:46.295
Colossians chapter four.

31
00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:50.095
We'll be in verses two through six, just a few today

32
00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:52.375
before we finish it out next Sunday.

33
00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:56.975
Now it is a little bit different than Jake

34
00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:59.855
and Elwood blues, their mission they were on,

35
00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:02.815
but so you're gonna see today that just as much in some way,

36
00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:04.895
we are also on a mission from God.

37
00:02:05.395 --> 00:02:07.895
Uh, so that's where we're going today with this,

38
00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:10.175
that passage as we see it.

39
00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:14.095
Because the Christian faith is not merely intellectual.

40
00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:16.455
There is a lot of head knowledge

41
00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:18.615
and understanding of who God is and what he's done.

42
00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:21.975
And that helps us then in our hearts grow to love him more

43
00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:25.375
and to gratefully praise him more with, with a,

44
00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:27.335
a true heart of worship.

45
00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:29.215
But then it doesn't just stay there.

46
00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:32.455
It's supposed to come into our hands, into our lives,

47
00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:34.175
the way we live, the way we speak.

48
00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:37.815
All of that is supposed to be changed by the faith

49
00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:39.415
we call Christianity.

50
00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:42.575
And Paul has set that up this whole time

51
00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:43.895
through the letter to the Colossians.

52
00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:46.495
He's talking to a church in a very dark city

53
00:02:46.785 --> 00:02:49.215
where there's a lot of worldly powers

54
00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:50.375
and philosophies around them.

55
00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.655
There's a, a buffet of religious options

56
00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:54.095
that they have in Colossae.

57
00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:58.135
And he says, no wait. Christ is above all of those.

58
00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:03.645
And he says it so clearly that Christ is the only way

59
00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:05.965
to salvation that, that you don't need all

60
00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:08.805
of these other religious practices on top of things.

61
00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:10.245
You don't need any of that stuff.

62
00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:13.445
You just need Christ as your substitute,

63
00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:18.285
But in Christ saving you.

64
00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:22.495
He's saying this to the Colossians as Christ has saved you,

65
00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:25.775
he's made you new, that he's changing you from the

66
00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:28.375
inside out to make you a completely different person.

67
00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:32.055
That your life should now be a shining city on a hill

68
00:03:33.105 --> 00:03:35.935
reflecting the change God's done in you.

69
00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:39.465
Every facet of your life will be different.

70
00:03:41.085 --> 00:03:44.665
And so today we're gonna see how we then they were

71
00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:49.505
and we today are to carry that good news message to a lost

72
00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:50.585
and dark world around us.

73
00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:54.065
Similar to Colossae, how they were called to go take it

74
00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:55.985
to people around them.

75
00:03:56.205 --> 00:04:00.465
We the same are called to go on mission, to live sin

76
00:04:01.195 --> 00:04:02.345
every day as well.

77
00:04:03.045 --> 00:04:05.465
How do we do that? Well, Colossians four, two

78
00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:06.985
through six will get us there.

79
00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:11.065
Look at it now. Continue

80
00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:12.785
steadfastly in prayer,

81
00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.865
being watchful in it with thanksgiving.

82
00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:20.705
At the same time, pray also for us that God may open

83
00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:24.305
to us a door for the word to declare the mystery

84
00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.185
of Christ on account of which I'm in prison,

85
00:04:27.015 --> 00:04:29.625
that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.

86
00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:33.105
Walk in wisdom toward outsiders,

87
00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:35.345
making the best use of the time.

88
00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:40.665
Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt so

89
00:04:40.665 --> 00:04:43.825
that you may know how you ought to answer each person.

90
00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:48.425
God, show us what you want us to see here in your word

91
00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:50.665
and change us accordingly.

92
00:04:51.495 --> 00:04:55.585
It's your work. Do it spirit in us. In Jesus' name. Amen.

93
00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:00.025
Now he kind of does it here, but he'd already done this.

94
00:05:00.025 --> 00:05:02.185
Paul had already commended the Colossians

95
00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:05.025
for their faithful lifestyles back in chapters one and two.

96
00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:07.385
He mentioned that a couple times the way they were living.

97
00:05:07.525 --> 00:05:11.945
But but in the same vein, he had celebrated this good fruit

98
00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:13.665
that God had produced in them

99
00:05:13.765 --> 00:05:15.585
and through them, not only locally

100
00:05:15.725 --> 00:05:18.425
but even to the ends of the earth, to the whole world.

101
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:22.265
He says, and he prayed that God would do that

102
00:05:22.265 --> 00:05:23.265
through them even more.

103
00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:26.945
That God's fruit would keep growing such

104
00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:29.425
that it would keep spreading just from this little

105
00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:30.545
church in Colossi.

106
00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:33.305
Now what's the fruit he's talking about?

107
00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:36.025
What's this spreading from Colossae?

108
00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:37.705
What's the gospel truth being spread?

109
00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:39.825
It's the disciples being made.

110
00:05:40.255 --> 00:05:44.065
It's the same thing that Jesus ended with in Matthew 28 18

111
00:05:44.065 --> 00:05:46.785
through 20, his ministry as he was about

112
00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:48.345
to ascend to heaven.

113
00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:50.985
He says this, the great commission, you might know it

114
00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:52.985
as Jesus came and said to the disciples,

115
00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:55.665
all authority in heaven on earth been given to me.

116
00:05:56.205 --> 00:05:58.965
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,

117
00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:02.005
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son

118
00:06:02.005 --> 00:06:04.685
and of the Holy Spirit teaching them to observe

119
00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.605
or obey all that I've commanded you.

120
00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:09.685
And behold, I'm with you always to the end of the age.

121
00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:12.805
And so that's the fruit He's saying.

122
00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:16.005
It's spreading out from colossae to the ends of the earth.

123
00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:19.045
And so just like he did back in chapter one for that kind

124
00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.285
of fruit, he's saying he's praying for them

125
00:06:21.285 --> 00:06:22.365
that fruit would expand.

126
00:06:22.475 --> 00:06:25.005
Here he talks about prayer.

127
00:06:25.175 --> 00:06:28.405
Again, Colossians four, verses two and three.

128
00:06:28.425 --> 00:06:29.485
He talks about prayer.

129
00:06:29.545 --> 00:06:32.045
The Colossians ought to pray steadfastly

130
00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:35.045
and be thankful in their prayer for

131
00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:36.205
what God has done for them.

132
00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:37.925
But, but there's a little difference

133
00:06:38.235 --> 00:06:39.565
what he did in chapter one.

134
00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:42.845
Paul prayed for them that the fruit would grow through them.

135
00:06:43.025 --> 00:06:47.365
Notice here in chapter four, he asks them to pray for him.

136
00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:50.645
Really? He says, for us.

137
00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:53.765
'cause remember all the way back in the first week we saw

138
00:06:53.765 --> 00:06:55.205
that Timothy's there with Paul.

139
00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:57.405
And so he's kind of writing this in conjunction.

140
00:06:57.545 --> 00:06:59.725
So he says, pray for us. That's Timothy.

141
00:07:00.225 --> 00:07:04.845
But notice Paul had no shame in asking them to pray for him.

142
00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:09.645
He says, God, I need your prayers. Please pray for me.

143
00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:11.325
What did he ask him to pray for though?

144
00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:15.085
'cause he's in prison. He's like, Hey guys, can you pray

145
00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:17.765
that God would miraculously break me outta prison?

146
00:07:18.385 --> 00:07:20.285
Can you pray that God would make my life more

147
00:07:20.285 --> 00:07:21.445
comfortable here?

148
00:07:21.745 --> 00:07:23.725
Man, it's tough. No. What does he pray for?

149
00:07:24.865 --> 00:07:26.645
He says, may you pray

150
00:07:26.645 --> 00:07:29.845
that God would advance his mission through me.

151
00:07:32.475 --> 00:07:35.775
He longed for them to pray for open doors for the gospel,

152
00:07:36.315 --> 00:07:37.695
for this good news.

153
00:07:37.755 --> 00:07:39.815
The go, the God's word would go forth.

154
00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:43.055
He prayed that the gospel would spread even

155
00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:46.615
among the prison guard, which we saw happen in Philippi,

156
00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:51.415
that people even in the prison would be saved.

157
00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:53.335
He said, that's what I want you to pray for.

158
00:07:53.335 --> 00:07:54.735
That's why the first point today

159
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.815
is we're talking about God's mission.

160
00:07:57.115 --> 00:07:59.095
It demands vigilant prayer.

161
00:08:01.165 --> 00:08:03.455
It's not just that we can, all right, let's go live sin.

162
00:08:03.755 --> 00:08:06.615
No, it demands vigilant prayer.

163
00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:08.815
He asks them to pray for the mission.

164
00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:12.135
In verse three, that open doors would happen to,

165
00:08:12.135 --> 00:08:13.175
God's word would spread.

166
00:08:13.435 --> 00:08:16.655
But verse two tells them how to go about that prayer.

167
00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:18.415
Look again. Verse two.

168
00:08:18.435 --> 00:08:22.255
He says, continue steadfastly in prayer,

169
00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:25.855
being watchful in it with thanksgiving.

170
00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:29.575
As you pray for the mission, that's how you're to do it.

171
00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:30.815
Be persistent.

172
00:08:31.275 --> 00:08:35.775
Be dedicated to practicing the discipline of prayer.

173
00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:39.055
Now, this is not a new concept.

174
00:08:39.965 --> 00:08:43.975
When you think back to the first disciples

175
00:08:44.015 --> 00:08:47.215
after Jesus ascended, what did they naturally know to do?

176
00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:51.415
Acts one. All they do to do is like just pray.

177
00:08:52.305 --> 00:08:54.255
Jesus had ascended. We don't know what to do next.

178
00:08:54.315 --> 00:08:57.205
So we just pray. They devoted themselves to it.

179
00:08:57.205 --> 00:08:58.885
It says then in Acts two,

180
00:08:58.935 --> 00:09:03.445
after the first church is formed, acts 2 42, it says,

181
00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:05.125
that was part of what they did.

182
00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:08.245
They devoted themselves to the apostles teaching

183
00:09:08.385 --> 00:09:10.445
to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread

184
00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:12.165
and to the prayers.

185
00:09:13.235 --> 00:09:16.485
They were devoted to the prayers.

186
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.875
When you look at that verb in acts

187
00:09:21.015 --> 00:09:25.315
or in Colossians four, two, continue steadfastly in prayer.

188
00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:29.075
That is the same idea. Devotion to it, continuing in it.

189
00:09:29.095 --> 00:09:31.315
And notice you might not be able to see it there.

190
00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:36.355
It's a plural command meaning together.

191
00:09:38.135 --> 00:09:40.595
So you could be devoted to prayer by yourself on your own.

192
00:09:40.595 --> 00:09:43.755
This says, no, actually you should be the whole community

193
00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:46.195
of faith devoted to prayer together.

194
00:09:49.065 --> 00:09:50.665
'cause our faith is personal.

195
00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:52.785
Yes, but it was never meant to be private.

196
00:09:55.245 --> 00:09:58.185
God forms the body. He builds this family of faith.

197
00:09:58.255 --> 00:10:00.745
It's never meant to be you and Jesus. That's it.

198
00:10:03.855 --> 00:10:05.185
It's shared. It's a family.

199
00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:07.425
Even this idea of prayer, he says,

200
00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:10.425
continue steadfastly together in this.

201
00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:11.465
That's why we,

202
00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:13.985
we did this last year coming up in a couple weeks,

203
00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:17.745
when the first week of 2024 happens, we're gonna do a week

204
00:10:17.745 --> 00:10:21.465
of prayer to kind of devote the Lord, devote that year

205
00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:24.225
to the Lord, and, and we're gonna plan a, a lot

206
00:10:24.225 --> 00:10:27.665
of gatherings during that week where we can come together

207
00:10:27.845 --> 00:10:29.905
to devote ourselves to prayer.

208
00:10:31.245 --> 00:10:33.265
I'm expecting and anticipating you to do that

209
00:10:33.285 --> 00:10:34.385
by yourself all year.

210
00:10:34.405 --> 00:10:36.705
Of course, that's obviously part of our faith.

211
00:10:36.805 --> 00:10:39.465
But, but in a unique way for us to come together

212
00:10:40.805 --> 00:10:43.585
and continue steadfastly, devote ourselves to prayer

213
00:10:43.965 --> 00:10:45.465
for the mission, for our church,

214
00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:46.745
for each other, all of that.

215
00:10:47.015 --> 00:10:50.705
Because it says, be watchful in prayer.

216
00:10:52.575 --> 00:10:56.385
That word is to means to vigilantly. Keep your eyes open.

217
00:10:57.885 --> 00:10:59.745
The idea is like a, a night watchman

218
00:10:59.745 --> 00:11:03.745
or a a guard that is posted to spot the opposing army

219
00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:06.985
or to watch and see for the bank robber

220
00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:09.945
or for the iceberg that's coming ahead, right?

221
00:11:09.965 --> 00:11:11.985
But, but the idea is to be watchful is

222
00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:14.185
that you don't fall asleep on your watch.

223
00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:18.345
I was thinking about this. I think it's the scene in every

224
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.065
movie where someone breaks outta prison,

225
00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:22.265
where there's the guy kind

226
00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:24.345
of slouched back in the chair, the guard, right?

227
00:11:24.425 --> 00:11:26.625
And he's just sleeping about five feet

228
00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:28.185
or so from the jail cell.

229
00:11:28.405 --> 00:11:30.825
And somehow the prisoner finds a stick

230
00:11:31.005 --> 00:11:33.745
and is able to maneuver that huge ring

231
00:11:33.745 --> 00:11:35.345
that the key's sitting on, right?

232
00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.585
And they're maneuvering in there

233
00:11:36.585 --> 00:11:37.985
and they're just barely able to get it.

234
00:11:37.985 --> 00:11:39.985
And then they break out that it seems like every movie,

235
00:11:39.995 --> 00:11:42.185
maybe it's cartoons, that's all the movies I watch, but,

236
00:11:42.245 --> 00:11:44.345
but maybe it's, that's how it works.

237
00:11:44.535 --> 00:11:46.465
It's like that's falling asleep

238
00:11:46.965 --> 00:11:49.425
and all of a sudden they lose the prisoner.

239
00:11:50.285 --> 00:11:51.465
That's what we're seeing here.

240
00:11:51.725 --> 00:11:53.605
God says, Colossians four,

241
00:11:53.785 --> 00:11:58.085
we can't fall asleep on our watch in prayer.

242
00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:03.485
We've got to stay vigilant to pray for ourselves of course,

243
00:12:03.545 --> 00:12:06.685
but to pray for others, to pray for our church, to pray

244
00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:09.005
for the mission of God, to go forth.

245
00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:12.125
It has to be centered

246
00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:14.325
and focused with prayer.

247
00:12:16.405 --> 00:12:17.805
Remember the Colossians, they're in a tough spot.

248
00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:20.765
They're a dangerous place. There's a lot of risk.

249
00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:25.445
And so Paul says, pray. You have to pray.

250
00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:32.555
Is that your go-to, are you

251
00:12:32.555 --> 00:12:33.715
devoting yourself to prayer?

252
00:12:35.175 --> 00:12:39.435
Are you disciplining yourself to go to war spiritually?

253
00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:43.755
As Ephesians six says, this battle we're fighting,

254
00:12:43.815 --> 00:12:45.315
it seems like it's a culture thing

255
00:12:45.315 --> 00:12:46.795
or whatever, from an enemy outside.

256
00:12:46.815 --> 00:12:50.755
No, the actual battle Ephesians six says is a spiritual one.

257
00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:54.875
We're not battling flesh and blood. It's a spiritual battle.

258
00:12:55.215 --> 00:12:57.035
So are you praying?

259
00:12:57.175 --> 00:12:59.235
I'm, I'm so thankful for the many

260
00:12:59.775 --> 00:13:02.475
prayer warriors we we have in this church.

261
00:13:04.535 --> 00:13:07.235
I'm not still standing up here if we don't have them

262
00:13:07.345 --> 00:13:10.515
praying, the ministry doesn't go forth like it does if

263
00:13:10.515 --> 00:13:12.475
they're not praying for our church

264
00:13:14.675 --> 00:13:17.085
because this is God's work.

265
00:13:18.505 --> 00:13:21.045
We can be awesome and great and it doesn't work.

266
00:13:21.465 --> 00:13:24.005
We can be normal. And it does work.

267
00:13:25.425 --> 00:13:29.125
If God chooses to do whichever way he does, it's God's work.

268
00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:31.205
And so when we pray, we're asking him to work

269
00:13:31.465 --> 00:13:33.405
and we're asking him for the power to do

270
00:13:33.405 --> 00:13:34.765
what he wants us to do in the mission.

271
00:13:36.225 --> 00:13:39.325
God, we need you. We're just saying abide, right God,

272
00:13:39.325 --> 00:13:40.525
this is your work.

273
00:13:40.835 --> 00:13:45.725
When we abide, you produce the fruit. So we must pray.

274
00:13:49.075 --> 00:13:51.825
Verse three. At the same time, pray also for us

275
00:13:51.825 --> 00:13:54.505
that God may open to us a door for the word

276
00:13:55.245 --> 00:13:57.465
to declare the mystery of Christ on account

277
00:13:57.465 --> 00:14:01.025
of which I'm in prison, that I may make it clear, which is

278
00:14:01.085 --> 00:14:02.585
how I ought to speak.

279
00:14:05.255 --> 00:14:07.065
I've already mentioned this, but Paul mostly write,

280
00:14:07.135 --> 00:14:08.505
most likely wrote this letter

281
00:14:08.525 --> 00:14:11.865
to the Colossian church while he was in prison in Rome.

282
00:14:13.045 --> 00:14:14.385
And he was in there not

283
00:14:14.385 --> 00:14:16.625
because he was necessarily a criminal, it was

284
00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:19.065
because he was a missionary of this mystery,

285
00:14:19.175 --> 00:14:20.785
this gospel of Jesus Christ.

286
00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:24.625
And they didn't like it. They thought he was subversive.

287
00:14:26.325 --> 00:14:28.625
Now he's thrown in prison and somebody might think, well,

288
00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:29.945
that's the end of his ministry, right?

289
00:14:31.325 --> 00:14:33.385
No, Not at all.

290
00:14:34.085 --> 00:14:37.865
Prison did not kill Paul's evangelistic activities.

291
00:14:37.865 --> 00:14:39.425
In fact, it didn't even hinder it at all.

292
00:14:40.345 --> 00:14:42.625
I mean, I love Paul, just think about this.

293
00:14:43.765 --> 00:14:45.865
You couldn't do anything to get to Paul.

294
00:14:46.855 --> 00:14:48.665
Like you say, Hey Paul, we're gonna kill you.

295
00:14:48.695 --> 00:14:50.425
He's like to, to die his game.

296
00:14:51.825 --> 00:14:53.645
But okay, well, well then we're we'll let you live.

297
00:14:53.655 --> 00:14:56.445
We're gonna do this like, hey, to live is Christ alright?

298
00:14:56.445 --> 00:14:57.965
We'll throw you in prison and you,

299
00:14:57.985 --> 00:14:59.885
and okay, well I'll convert all your guards, right?

300
00:14:59.885 --> 00:15:00.965
Like we're gonna go through this.

301
00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:04.045
And he's like, you couldn't do anything to touch him.

302
00:15:07.755 --> 00:15:12.055
Not only all that, not only was he propelled by this,

303
00:15:12.115 --> 00:15:15.455
but him being put in prison actually encouraged other people

304
00:15:15.835 --> 00:15:17.615
to share the gospel as well.

305
00:15:18.525 --> 00:15:21.135
This is what he says in Philippians one, 12 through 14.

306
00:15:21.475 --> 00:15:23.015
He says, I want you to know, brothers, that

307
00:15:23.015 --> 00:15:24.735
what has happened to me has really served

308
00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:25.815
to advance the gospel.

309
00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:30.695
Me being thrown in prison has advanced the gospel.

310
00:15:31.555 --> 00:15:34.935
How it has become known throughout the

311
00:15:35.075 --> 00:15:36.735
entire imperial guard.

312
00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:39.575
That's the kind of jailers you might think.

313
00:15:40.755 --> 00:15:44.175
And to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ.

314
00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:48.965
And most of the brothers having become confident in the Lord

315
00:15:49.185 --> 00:15:51.405
by my imprisonment, are much more bold

316
00:15:51.465 --> 00:15:53.845
to speak the word without fear.

317
00:15:55.945 --> 00:15:59.245
So his pri, his imprisonment advanced the gospel.

318
00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:00.525
And so here in Colossians,

319
00:16:00.545 --> 00:16:02.605
Paul's saying, pray for the mission.

320
00:16:04.475 --> 00:16:07.125
Pray that God would initiate it. God would assist it.

321
00:16:07.145 --> 00:16:09.005
God would direct the avenues for me

322
00:16:09.005 --> 00:16:11.365
to continue preaching the gospel.

323
00:16:13.235 --> 00:16:15.765
Because his goal was to make clear,

324
00:16:16.025 --> 00:16:18.045
or the other word might be reveal

325
00:16:18.595 --> 00:16:20.885
this message from God about this Messiah

326
00:16:21.825 --> 00:16:23.045
in Phil in Philippi, right?

327
00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:26.165
The jail. He said, everybody had heard, I'm here

328
00:16:26.165 --> 00:16:30.725
because of the Messiah here in Colossae.

329
00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:33.365
When he is imprisoned in Rome, he's saying, man, I,

330
00:16:33.565 --> 00:16:35.285
I want everybody to hear, I want everybody

331
00:16:35.305 --> 00:16:37.685
to see about this Messiah.

332
00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:38.765
I wanna reveal that.

333
00:16:38.785 --> 00:16:40.925
By the way, it's the same word back in chapter three,

334
00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:45.125
verse four, when he says, Christ will appear someday,

335
00:16:45.145 --> 00:16:47.605
Christ is going to be revealed someday.

336
00:16:47.795 --> 00:16:49.605
He's saying, I'm doing the same thing today

337
00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:51.005
with this good news.

338
00:16:53.055 --> 00:16:57.145
Like he's pulling the curtain back of this heavenly mystery

339
00:16:57.145 --> 00:17:00.105
of salvation, something that's been hidden for generations.

340
00:17:00.525 --> 00:17:02.785
He says, now it's been revealed in Jesus.

341
00:17:04.165 --> 00:17:06.305
And he's exposing that, revealing it

342
00:17:06.605 --> 00:17:08.825
to all these people who'd never heard it before

343
00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:10.905
or had a Jewish perspective before.

344
00:17:11.045 --> 00:17:13.825
Now he's like, Nope, here it is. It's in Christ.

345
00:17:17.295 --> 00:17:19.875
And he was doing that no matter the cost.

346
00:17:22.455 --> 00:17:24.115
And so the mission demands prayer.

347
00:17:24.175 --> 00:17:25.315
But we also learn here

348
00:17:25.315 --> 00:17:28.555
that God's mission demands bold revelation

349
00:17:29.895 --> 00:17:31.115
of this gospel message.

350
00:17:32.255 --> 00:17:33.795
It demands bold revelation.

351
00:17:36.425 --> 00:17:38.155
Paul says, my whole goal, pray

352
00:17:38.155 --> 00:17:40.715
for me the mission would expand so that I can reveal

353
00:17:42.775 --> 00:17:45.395
boldly who this Messiah is.

354
00:17:48.645 --> 00:17:51.805
Listen, you and I cannot be afraid of the consequences

355
00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:54.285
of unveiling the mystery of this gospel

356
00:17:54.505 --> 00:17:55.925
to a world that doesn't want to hear it.

357
00:17:59.015 --> 00:18:00.195
And it might hurt a little bit.

358
00:18:02.835 --> 00:18:04.215
It might mean that you lose friends.

359
00:18:05.155 --> 00:18:07.375
It, It might mean you lose a job.

360
00:18:09.115 --> 00:18:10.255
It might mean you go to prison.

361
00:18:12.055 --> 00:18:13.435
It might mean you lose your life.

362
00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:18.755
Now, I'm not saying we should be unwise

363
00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:20.395
and just go about all this in a,

364
00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:22.835
a really silly unwise kind of way.

365
00:18:23.055 --> 00:18:25.515
But the reality is that all

366
00:18:25.535 --> 00:18:28.755
of church history involves persecution.

367
00:18:30.815 --> 00:18:33.195
We have been spared in many ways,

368
00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:35.195
but all the rest of church history

369
00:18:36.355 --> 00:18:38.395
involves persecution.

370
00:18:40.735 --> 00:18:41.835
And I wrote that phrase

371
00:18:43.095 --> 00:18:46.595
and I thought, okay, how?

372
00:18:46.775 --> 00:18:48.515
How will I ever be prepared for that?

373
00:18:50.115 --> 00:18:52.835
'cause you read stories and you hear of history like

374
00:18:52.935 --> 00:18:55.995
how am I ever gonna be prepared for when not if, when

375
00:18:56.145 --> 00:18:57.435
that time comes?

376
00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.475
Well, a few weeks ago, one of our staff members, Kaylynn,

377
00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:06.915
she shared uh, this story with me about Corey 10,

378
00:19:06.915 --> 00:19:08.195
boom, you might know that name.

379
00:19:08.365 --> 00:19:09.555
She's a Christian

380
00:19:09.555 --> 00:19:12.875
who helped many Jews escape Nazi Germany in the forties

381
00:19:12.925 --> 00:19:13.955
World War II time.

382
00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:19.075
Here's what Corey said about preparing for persecution.

383
00:19:21.335 --> 00:19:23.395
She said, when I was a little girl, I went to my father

384
00:19:23.455 --> 00:19:25.155
and said, daddy, I'm afraid

385
00:19:25.155 --> 00:19:27.635
that I will never be strong enough to be a martyr

386
00:19:27.635 --> 00:19:29.795
for Jesus Christ, to be killed

387
00:19:29.795 --> 00:19:30.955
for my faith, is what she's saying.

388
00:19:32.385 --> 00:19:35.595
Tell me. I said, father, when you take a train trip

389
00:19:35.615 --> 00:19:38.995
to Amsterdam, when do I give you the money for the ticket?

390
00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:44.685
Three Weeks before, no daddy, you give me the money

391
00:19:45.025 --> 00:19:47.645
for the ticket just before we get on the train.

392
00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:51.115
That's right. My father said,

393
00:19:51.735 --> 00:19:54.275
and so it is with God's strength.

394
00:19:55.055 --> 00:19:58.395
Our Father in heaven knows when you will need the strength

395
00:19:58.395 --> 00:20:00.275
to be a martyr for Jesus Christ.

396
00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:04.195
And he will supply all you need just in time.

397
00:20:06.115 --> 00:20:10.815
Very good. God's mission demands bold revelation

398
00:20:10.885 --> 00:20:13.055
even when it costs us a lot.

399
00:20:14.845 --> 00:20:19.215
He's worthy and he will provide the strength you need

400
00:20:19.835 --> 00:20:22.495
to face whatever he's calling you to face.

401
00:20:26.575 --> 00:20:29.035
And so the interesting thing about God's mission is it does

402
00:20:29.035 --> 00:20:31.355
involve words, right?

403
00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:34.355
We have a, it's called the good news after all right?

404
00:20:34.455 --> 00:20:37.275
So the gospel is a message,

405
00:20:38.975 --> 00:20:43.195
but the mission plays out in more than just speech

406
00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:44.395
and words.

407
00:20:47.065 --> 00:20:48.685
See, some people are called to be like Paul

408
00:20:48.705 --> 00:20:50.445
and travel the world and share the gospel.

409
00:20:50.555 --> 00:20:52.085
Some people are called to be like Billy Graham

410
00:20:52.105 --> 00:20:55.245
and be a, a well-known evangelist to be able

411
00:20:55.245 --> 00:20:56.845
to share the gospel anywhere and everywhere.

412
00:20:56.845 --> 00:20:59.005
Some people are going to end up in prison

413
00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:00.925
for the gospel, some won't.

414
00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:05.565
But all of us are called to be

415
00:21:05.565 --> 00:21:09.445
what Paul told the Colossians to be here in verses five

416
00:21:09.445 --> 00:21:12.725
and six, whether those things are true of you

417
00:21:12.725 --> 00:21:16.685
or not, this absolutely is true and should be true of you.

418
00:21:16.685 --> 00:21:20.165
Verse five, walk in wisdom toward outsiders

419
00:21:21.585 --> 00:21:23.165
making the best use of the time.

420
00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:28.205
Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt so

421
00:21:28.205 --> 00:21:31.685
that you may know how you ought to answer each person.

422
00:21:33.735 --> 00:21:36.525
Colossians, here's how you are to live. Same for us today.

423
00:21:36.525 --> 00:21:39.285
That God's mission demands wise, conduct

424
00:21:41.945 --> 00:21:45.415
God's mission, demands wise conduct as well.

425
00:21:47.475 --> 00:21:50.655
Our lives are on display before the world.

426
00:21:52.005 --> 00:21:56.055
They're a picture of what God does in someone

427
00:21:56.115 --> 00:21:59.265
who believes of who he is.

428
00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.785
So he talks about this walk. Well, that's our daily lives.

429
00:22:04.185 --> 00:22:05.305
Remember he said that in chapter one,

430
00:22:05.415 --> 00:22:07.025
walk in a manner worthy of the Lord.

431
00:22:07.355 --> 00:22:10.385
Fully pleasing. Chapter two verse six, walk in him

432
00:22:10.405 --> 00:22:13.465
as you've received him some parts of their lives.

433
00:22:13.785 --> 00:22:15.745
Remember we said this last week about the household code.

434
00:22:16.015 --> 00:22:19.465
Some parts of the Colossians lives would not look much

435
00:22:19.465 --> 00:22:21.745
different from the outside as anybody else,

436
00:22:24.605 --> 00:22:29.265
but in many ways they were not to fit in to the same way

437
00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:30.825
of the Colossians around them.

438
00:22:33.755 --> 00:22:37.235
Remember, husbands were not just to tolerate their wives.

439
00:22:37.235 --> 00:22:39.435
Husbands were to agape love their wives.

440
00:22:40.105 --> 00:22:42.355
Parents were to honor their children

441
00:22:42.455 --> 00:22:44.195
and treat them with respect.

442
00:22:44.255 --> 00:22:47.635
And, and masters were to honor slaves and,

443
00:22:47.775 --> 00:22:50.715
and here he says not only all that they were also to walk

444
00:22:50.975 --> 00:22:52.875
and live in a wise way.

445
00:22:52.875 --> 00:22:54.075
They were to avoid sin,

446
00:22:54.215 --> 00:22:55.715
but they were also to walk in a way

447
00:22:55.715 --> 00:22:58.035
that would invite curiosity about their lives.

448
00:22:58.265 --> 00:23:00.235
Like what is different about you?

449
00:23:02.265 --> 00:23:05.435
It's what Philippians two 14 and 15 says.

450
00:23:05.495 --> 00:23:08.995
He says, do all things without grumbling or disputing

451
00:23:08.995 --> 00:23:11.355
or complaining that you may be blameless

452
00:23:11.375 --> 00:23:14.835
and innocent children of God without blemish in the midst

453
00:23:14.835 --> 00:23:19.435
of a crooked and twisted generation among whom you shine

454
00:23:19.975 --> 00:23:21.555
as lights in the world.

455
00:23:24.025 --> 00:23:26.435
It's the same kind of language Jesus used back in Matthew

456
00:23:26.545 --> 00:23:27.795
five and the Sermon on the Mount,

457
00:23:27.865 --> 00:23:28.955
it's probably coming from this.

458
00:23:29.015 --> 00:23:30.515
It says, you are the light of the world.

459
00:23:31.555 --> 00:23:33.355
A city set on a hill cannot be hidden,

460
00:23:34.055 --> 00:23:37.315
nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket,

461
00:23:37.455 --> 00:23:38.595
but they put it on a stand

462
00:23:38.595 --> 00:23:40.395
and it gives light to all in the house.

463
00:23:41.175 --> 00:23:43.035
In the same way, let your light shine

464
00:23:43.095 --> 00:23:46.965
before others so that they may see your good works

465
00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:50.325
and give glory to your father who is in heaven.

466
00:23:52.095 --> 00:23:55.885
Jesus tied your lifestyle to the mission,

467
00:23:57.065 --> 00:23:59.245
the way you live to the mission.

468
00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:01.805
The only way you can live that kind of life though,

469
00:24:03.945 --> 00:24:05.675
like if you're gonna live a life that's good works

470
00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:08.875
and above reproach and all of that, Colossians four, five,

471
00:24:08.935 --> 00:24:11.795
you have to do that by making the best use of the time.

472
00:24:11.935 --> 00:24:15.995
He says It's redeeming the time.

473
00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:18.875
Buying it back is another way you could say it.

474
00:24:20.355 --> 00:24:22.635
'cause here's the reality. Every one

475
00:24:22.635 --> 00:24:26.675
of us has a limited amount of time on this earth.

476
00:24:28.655 --> 00:24:30.275
If you live to be 80 years old,

477
00:24:32.215 --> 00:24:35.115
you have 29,000 days to live your life.

478
00:24:37.675 --> 00:24:40.135
And some of you that's like, that's forever 29,000. Okay?

479
00:24:40.195 --> 00:24:42.815
29,000 days is really not

480
00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:44.215
that many when you start to think about it.

481
00:24:45.185 --> 00:24:46.375
700,000 hours.

482
00:24:48.925 --> 00:24:51.975
This says, by the way, if Jesus comes back

483
00:24:51.975 --> 00:24:53.375
before you died, do you have even less time?

484
00:24:54.425 --> 00:24:58.575
Right? So this says to reclaim the time

485
00:24:58.875 --> 00:25:01.855
to make the best use of the time is to make the most

486
00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:03.535
of the opportunities you have for the gospel.

487
00:25:05.855 --> 00:25:07.635
You can't do that once Jesus returns.

488
00:25:07.635 --> 00:25:09.115
Once you go to heaven, like that's done.

489
00:25:09.255 --> 00:25:11.515
The mission is accomplished at that point.

490
00:25:11.845 --> 00:25:14.995
Until that time you have a limited amount of time.

491
00:25:15.375 --> 00:25:17.995
And that's not just saying you need to read the Bible more

492
00:25:17.995 --> 00:25:19.155
or you need to pray more.

493
00:25:19.165 --> 00:25:20.235
Those are good things.

494
00:25:20.335 --> 00:25:21.595
But notice what he says to do

495
00:25:21.595 --> 00:25:22.835
to make the best use of the time.

496
00:25:23.305 --> 00:25:25.435
Walk in wisdom toward outsiders.

497
00:25:28.055 --> 00:25:32.115
You have a responsibility to obey Christ.

498
00:25:32.215 --> 00:25:33.875
But that's not just an end in itself.

499
00:25:33.875 --> 00:25:36.475
Notice it's actually for people

500
00:25:36.475 --> 00:25:38.075
who are not yet believers too.

501
00:25:40.545 --> 00:25:43.675
Walk in wisdom toward outsiders for those yet to believe.

502
00:25:43.705 --> 00:25:46.035
It's walking the walk, not just talking the talk

503
00:25:47.065 --> 00:25:49.075
that you are credibly showing

504
00:25:49.505 --> 00:25:51.635
that something's happened in your life,

505
00:25:51.665 --> 00:25:53.155
that Christ has changed you.

506
00:25:55.015 --> 00:25:56.075
And I get it. I'm not,

507
00:25:56.075 --> 00:25:59.075
you're not perfectly wise in all your conduct.

508
00:26:00.735 --> 00:26:03.515
You're gonna fail. You're going to blow it.

509
00:26:03.535 --> 00:26:05.035
But that's the beauty of the gospel.

510
00:26:05.335 --> 00:26:09.715
See, even as you share about Jesus, you can talk about

511
00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:11.555
how you need him just as much as they do.

512
00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:16.715
Maybe the most powerful thing in your life is not

513
00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:18.875
that everybody looks at you and says, boy, they're perfect.

514
00:26:19.105 --> 00:26:20.595
That they look at you and say, man,

515
00:26:20.615 --> 00:26:21.955
he knows he's not perfect.

516
00:26:22.335 --> 00:26:24.715
And what they need to see is repentance.

517
00:26:26.375 --> 00:26:27.755
And they see that you need Jesus

518
00:26:27.935 --> 00:26:30.115
and you're clinging to his life,

519
00:26:30.115 --> 00:26:31.235
death and resurrection in your place.

520
00:26:31.235 --> 00:26:35.395
That's what they need to see, that you're walking the walk

521
00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:37.915
as you repent.

522
00:26:40.135 --> 00:26:41.475
So make the best use of the time.

523
00:26:41.535 --> 00:26:43.485
One Corinthians six says, you're not your own.

524
00:26:43.505 --> 00:26:44.605
You were bought with a price.

525
00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:49.775
So you don't control this thing. This is not yours.

526
00:26:50.565 --> 00:26:53.375
Plus you think Christ has come,

527
00:26:53.555 --> 00:26:56.655
the kingdom has been announced, the new age has begun.

528
00:26:56.675 --> 00:26:58.215
Christ has coming back soon to

529
00:26:58.595 --> 00:27:01.655
to com completely consummate the kingdom.

530
00:27:01.915 --> 00:27:04.455
All of this, these things are happening soon.

531
00:27:04.515 --> 00:27:07.935
And so that's why we should not want to waste any time

532
00:27:08.485 --> 00:27:09.655
that we've been given to Steward.

533
00:27:13.025 --> 00:27:14.965
And so the question is, how do you want

534
00:27:14.965 --> 00:27:16.925
to spend those 29,000 days?

535
00:27:19.865 --> 00:27:22.085
How do you wanna spend those 700,000 hours

536
00:27:22.155 --> 00:27:23.325
that you've been given?

537
00:27:23.505 --> 00:27:28.445
Is that, is that meant to kind of create a pressure and a

538
00:27:28.445 --> 00:27:29.605
and a weight on your shoulders?

539
00:27:29.665 --> 00:27:34.285
No. But just think about how you wanna spend those time,

540
00:27:34.455 --> 00:27:35.685
those days, those hours.

541
00:27:35.825 --> 00:27:37.645
Is it watching cat videos on TikTok

542
00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:41.235
fantasy football?

543
00:27:42.935 --> 00:27:45.915
Is it endless scrolling on Facebook and Instagram?

544
00:27:46.055 --> 00:27:48.915
Is it binging another TV show?

545
00:27:48.975 --> 00:27:52.235
Is, is that making the best use of the time?

546
00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:56.055
Walking in wisdom toward outsiders

547
00:27:56.595 --> 00:28:01.055
or making the best use is getting involved in the mission

548
00:28:01.155 --> 00:28:05.055
of God, living a life that points to him,

549
00:28:06.075 --> 00:28:09.655
taking advantage of the opportunities he gives you every

550
00:28:09.755 --> 00:28:11.295
single day with lost people.

551
00:28:15.045 --> 00:28:16.625
That's at work, that's in your neighborhood,

552
00:28:16.645 --> 00:28:18.825
that's at school, that's overseas,

553
00:28:19.325 --> 00:28:21.225
that's in your neighborhood, all of that.

554
00:28:23.295 --> 00:28:24.985
I've heard it said for years this way.

555
00:28:24.985 --> 00:28:28.825
It was said many years ago, only one life

556
00:28:29.935 --> 00:28:31.345
will soon be passed.

557
00:28:32.935 --> 00:28:35.865
Only what's done for Christ will last

558
00:28:38.255 --> 00:28:40.505
make the best use of the time.

559
00:28:40.505 --> 00:28:42.225
Because here's the thing, you are going

560
00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:43.265
to get opportunities.

561
00:28:43.525 --> 00:28:47.025
If you look for opportunities. You just gotta look around.

562
00:28:47.045 --> 00:28:49.545
You just gotta see who God puts in your path he's going

563
00:28:49.545 --> 00:28:50.785
to get when you're looking for them.

564
00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:52.865
So here's the question that we're gonna end with.

565
00:28:52.865 --> 00:28:55.345
What do you do when you get an opportunity?

566
00:28:56.415 --> 00:28:59.985
What do you say when you get that opportunity?

567
00:28:59.985 --> 00:29:01.025
Look again at verse six.

568
00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:07.865
Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt so

569
00:29:07.865 --> 00:29:11.145
that you may know how you ought to answer each person.

570
00:29:13.045 --> 00:29:16.425
People are gonna ask you when you're living life empowered

571
00:29:16.425 --> 00:29:19.345
by prayer for God's mission, asking him to speak

572
00:29:19.345 --> 00:29:22.385
through you, walking wisely as Christ would.

573
00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:26.595
People are gonna ask you, why do you do what you do?

574
00:29:26.655 --> 00:29:31.435
And that's why God's mission also demands attractive speech.

575
00:29:32.695 --> 00:29:34.155
That's what verse six just said.

576
00:29:34.775 --> 00:29:36.995
It demands attractive speech.

577
00:29:39.815 --> 00:29:43.485
Now I say that firstly, in general, the way

578
00:29:43.485 --> 00:29:46.365
that you're supposed to to talk in your life

579
00:29:47.225 --> 00:29:48.245
should be attractive.

580
00:29:48.385 --> 00:29:52.325
It should not repel people in the way you just talk about

581
00:29:52.475 --> 00:29:54.605
that it should be tasty to people.

582
00:29:54.665 --> 00:29:56.165
You might say the way you speak,

583
00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:59.005
that would've stood out in Colossae very much

584
00:29:59.245 --> 00:30:00.925
'cause it was a harsh culture.

585
00:30:03.305 --> 00:30:05.885
But the other way attractive speech shows up is

586
00:30:05.885 --> 00:30:07.125
how you're able to answer those

587
00:30:07.185 --> 00:30:09.485
who would ask you questions about your faith.

588
00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:13.005
It's the same thing one Peter three 15

589
00:30:13.305 --> 00:30:16.765
and 16 says In your heart's,

590
00:30:16.765 --> 00:30:18.405
honor Christ, the Lord is holy.

591
00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:22.925
Set apart, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone

592
00:30:22.945 --> 00:30:26.165
who asks you for a reason, for the hope that is in you.

593
00:30:27.665 --> 00:30:29.765
Yet do it with gentleness and respect.

594
00:30:30.305 --> 00:30:33.765
Having a good conscience so that when you are slandered,

595
00:30:33.855 --> 00:30:37.165
those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be

596
00:30:37.225 --> 00:30:38.245
put to shame.

597
00:30:40.905 --> 00:30:43.365
So notice, remember Paul, he was out in the streets.

598
00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:44.565
He was in the synagogues,

599
00:30:44.565 --> 00:30:46.485
he was traveling the world preaching the gospel.

600
00:30:46.585 --> 00:30:47.605
That's what he was doing.

601
00:30:47.905 --> 00:30:50.085
But you also see here, in a sense, there's a way

602
00:30:50.085 --> 00:30:53.725
that we're inviting people in not just going to him

603
00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:57.205
and proclaiming and kind of entering into their time, but

604
00:30:57.265 --> 00:31:00.365
but inviting them into our lives such

605
00:31:00.365 --> 00:31:02.245
that they hear the gospel as well.

606
00:31:02.245 --> 00:31:04.245
That our individual lives, our families,

607
00:31:04.265 --> 00:31:07.205
our church should be so attractive

608
00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:10.805
that people want to be around us.

609
00:31:10.805 --> 00:31:12.245
They want to know what we believe.

610
00:31:12.625 --> 00:31:15.165
Why are you the way that you are?

611
00:31:15.225 --> 00:31:19.405
And listen, Paul expected the believers in Colossae to do

612
00:31:19.405 --> 00:31:24.085
that, in that kind of a culture as dark and lost

613
00:31:24.145 --> 00:31:26.165
and pervasive as that culture was.

614
00:31:26.265 --> 00:31:29.125
He still says you're gonna be able to live a life

615
00:31:29.125 --> 00:31:30.925
that stands out, that people would ask you.

616
00:31:34.785 --> 00:31:37.685
So we should be able to do the same kind

617
00:31:37.685 --> 00:31:39.245
of thing in a culture like

618
00:31:39.715 --> 00:31:40.715
Ours.

619
00:31:42.905 --> 00:31:47.785
And so are we. Are

620
00:31:47.785 --> 00:31:51.225
we living lives that are so attractive

621
00:31:51.335 --> 00:31:53.025
that the world notices?

622
00:31:58.405 --> 00:32:01.555
Would people all around us look at Christians

623
00:32:01.815 --> 00:32:04.435
and look at churches and say, man,

624
00:32:04.745 --> 00:32:07.195
there's something unexplainable going on over there.

625
00:32:07.865 --> 00:32:10.115
Only some God could do.

626
00:32:10.115 --> 00:32:14.935
What I see there is that happening.

627
00:32:18.865 --> 00:32:19.975
Sadly, I don't think it is.

628
00:32:20.555 --> 00:32:24.215
For the most part, I don't think we're living that kind

629
00:32:24.215 --> 00:32:25.215
of a life for the most part.

630
00:32:25.575 --> 00:32:26.215
I know I'm not

631
00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:31.835
now, I'm not saying we're not part

632
00:32:31.835 --> 00:32:32.995
of a lot of amazing things.

633
00:32:33.015 --> 00:32:36.115
You look at orphan care, you look at widows, we're treating

634
00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:38.555
with gentleness and kindness and provision

635
00:32:38.555 --> 00:32:42.045
and disaster relief and pregnancy care and prison ministries

636
00:32:42.045 --> 00:32:44.005
and all the things we, we see a lot of good.

637
00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:48.245
But you know what else Christians are known for?

638
00:32:51.725 --> 00:32:54.045
Snarky, disrespectful comments online,

639
00:32:59.255 --> 00:33:04.125
deep division, a divorce rate

640
00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:07.045
that's equal or above the rest of the world around us.

641
00:33:11.665 --> 00:33:14.685
Gossip clicks at school,

642
00:33:18.315 --> 00:33:19.565
rampant pornography use.

643
00:33:24.305 --> 00:33:26.605
That's why when we speak about the gospel so often,

644
00:33:26.665 --> 00:33:30.515
it falls flat because our our lives

645
00:33:31.415 --> 00:33:35.475
are not credible that this has really worked.

646
00:33:38.145 --> 00:33:41.365
Now God's gonna do his will with or without us.

647
00:33:42.025 --> 00:33:44.085
He, he can accomplish this. He saves people.

648
00:33:44.225 --> 00:33:47.125
Of course he will. And God absolutely uses broken

649
00:33:47.195 --> 00:33:48.285
vessels like you and me.

650
00:33:50.865 --> 00:33:53.845
But if we want to see him use us even more,

651
00:33:55.865 --> 00:33:59.925
if we wanna participate even more with his mission,

652
00:34:00.355 --> 00:34:03.005
then these verses today are critical.

653
00:34:04.735 --> 00:34:08.205
We've got to pray vigilantly. We can't fall asleep.

654
00:34:08.415 --> 00:34:10.125
We've gotta be ready, we've gotta be watching.

655
00:34:10.125 --> 00:34:11.965
We've gotta be thankful. And we're praying

656
00:34:11.965 --> 00:34:13.085
that God would do something

657
00:34:13.965 --> 00:34:15.585
and we're trusting that he can and will.

658
00:34:18.745 --> 00:34:20.215
We've gotta pray vigilantly.

659
00:34:20.215 --> 00:34:24.375
We've gotta proclaim the gospel boldly when we get a chance,

660
00:34:24.835 --> 00:34:26.375
not worried about the consequences,

661
00:34:26.835 --> 00:34:30.655
but win some with our words, not intentionally provoking.

662
00:34:34.355 --> 00:34:37.095
And we have to live holy lives

663
00:34:39.675 --> 00:34:42.095
in the power of God's spirit within us.

664
00:34:42.275 --> 00:34:44.935
We have to live a life that looks

665
00:34:45.485 --> 00:34:49.335
like it reflects the new self that God's created in us.

666
00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:52.975
We have to be different people.

667
00:34:52.975 --> 00:34:56.055
That our words would echo the change

668
00:34:56.325 --> 00:34:58.015
that God has made within us,

669
00:35:02.415 --> 00:35:05.425
such that instead of unbelievers critiquing us,

670
00:35:08.525 --> 00:35:11.115
hypocrites, you guys don't really believe what you say.

671
00:35:11.295 --> 00:35:13.195
You don't look any different than us.

672
00:35:13.345 --> 00:35:17.235
Instead of critiquing us, they would then instead say,

673
00:35:18.695 --> 00:35:22.475
can you tell me more about what God has done in your life?

674
00:35:24.815 --> 00:35:26.155
That's the hope.
