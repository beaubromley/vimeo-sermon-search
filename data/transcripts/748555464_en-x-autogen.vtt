00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Good evening.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.300
So we finish every evening with prayer and

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.700
I love hearing your praying together as micro groups,

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.400
but it hits me that we're not really started our evening

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.300
with prayer. And so I want to start our evening with prayer

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.900
this evening. Okay, let's pray father. Thank you so much for the

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.200
opportunity to be a part of something powerful Transcendent

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.300
and holy and I

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.800
pray Lord you would show us exactly. What is our role as it

10
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.300
comes to making disciples. Thank you

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.200
for those that are willing to give time up to learn and

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.800
discover. Just what you've called them to do and bless them

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.300
for it and I just pray that the spirit

14
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.200
would continue to work in our micro groups as

15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.400
we discuss this wonderful opportunity in Jesus

16
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.100
name. Amen.

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.300
All right, so we are talking about disciple making and I

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.100
want to do a little bit of review. This is our pathway and

19
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.200
oops. I forgot my pencil. Excuse me.

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.300
This is our pathway. And by the way in the

21
00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.600
coming.

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.500
Weeks and I don't know exactly when we're

23
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.200
gonna do this in the coming weeks. I'm gonna

24
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.300
have one of you guys come and do exactly what I've done. This

25
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.500
will be my fourth time. I've done this and I

26
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.200
want you to become so familiar with it that you can do it. So what

27
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.900
what the discipleship pathway

28
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.100
is is that everything is pointing people towards becoming

29
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.100
not only a disciple of Jesus one

30
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.800
who is a growing and knows Jesus

31
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.500
follows. Jesus being transformed by Changed by

32
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.700
Jesus and committed the mission of Jesus, but

33
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.900
Also someone who is reproducing

34
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.000
themselves, so that that happens

35
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.000
we become disciple makers as

36
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.000
soon as we come to know the Lord Jesus, we're Disciples

37
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.500
of Jesus, but and we

38
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.400
worship together and that's a good thing to do. But that's there's some

39
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.800
things that are limited as it pertains to our sitting and facing the

40
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800
same direction and listening to one person speak.

41
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.200
And I'll use an example

42
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.300
like this my wife and I when we first started dating, we we

43
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.500
would talk back and forth.

44
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.800
What do you think would have happened?

45
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.200
And see I'm making this up as I'm going along

46
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.100
so I gotta be really careful. What do you think would have happened

47
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.100
if I was the only one Speaking?

48
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.200
Like we would go out on today and I said well, I'm just glad you're here.

49
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.100
I've got so much to tell you about myself. I'm I grew up in the you know,

50
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.700
and I did all the talking and she never spoke. Do

51
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.300
you think we would date a second time?

52
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.200
No, no and the same would be true if she spoke the whole time.

53
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.400
But what we did is I would speak and listen and she would

54
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.300
speak and then listen and we would and that's how we got to know one another.

55
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.700
Well, that's exactly what happens in this pathway. We

56
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.500
have large equipping groups next week. We'll be

57
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.400
our fifth week and we'll actually not be meeting

58
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.000
as a disciple making 101 training group. This

59
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.500
will be a week off

60
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.800
and we will be looking at Family equipping

61
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.000
Ministry what that means is that the primary

62
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.500
disciple maker in a family is the parents

63
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
and the parents are partnering with the Henderson Hills Baptist

64
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.700
Church to raise Little Disciples. And so we'll be

65
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.000
talking about that next week. And so we'll be

66
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.500
taking one week pause but that's an example

67
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.400
of the equipping group, but it's pointing people where we

68
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.600
have

69
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.800
Community groups a great way to increase our

70
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.300
strength as disciples but but we've

71
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.600
been focusing this on Wednesday nights at

72
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.900
this is our sweet spot right here micro groups

73
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.100
where we can

74
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.100
Where we can learn about what it means

75
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.600
to be a have an intentional leader. And by the way, no, don't

76
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.100
get this wrong. All right

77
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.100
hear me out my prayer is and I've got

78
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.800
other groups praying now that one day you

79
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.700
Look down at your first button right there.

80
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.600
That's what that's the one I'm talking about. You will

81
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.200
be an intentional leader that you are

82
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.800
already beginning to pray about God. Who would

83
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.500
you have me invite to be in my

84
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.300
micro group and what you'll do

85
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.600
with that person is then you two will create

86
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.300
a relational environment where you can get

87
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.400
together and hear one another and you can do what my

88
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.200
wife and I did when we create a relationship you speak and then

89
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.300
listen and they speak and then listen and then eventually once

90
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.800
you have a a certain degree

91
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.400
of spiritual strength, then

92
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.200
you reproduce yourself so that

93
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.900
now that person becomes an intentional leader

94
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.500
and creates a relational environment with another

95
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.400
person and that's how exponential multiplication occurred

96
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.000
and that's why Jesus said he wanted it the way

97
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.400
he wanted it. All right. So what is a disciple?

98
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.300
Disciple is one who is following Jesus being changed

99
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.200
by Jesus and committed to the mission of

100
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.300
Jesus making disciples. I would love for you to memorize that

101
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.200
and so when I have you come up here and present this to

102
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.600
the correct crowd in a couple of weeks, you'll you'll nail

103
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.600
it and you won't have to read it. Okay, I've shown

104
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.900
you this graph. It's a little X Y axis graph

105
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.600
that here in our

106
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.100
worship center.

107
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.400
During our worship service. We have beautiful worship music. We

108
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.800
have a profoundly prepared and delivered sermon,

109
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.700
but we don't get to respond. And if

110
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.900
we do people think that we're crazy and sometimes

111
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.600
the ushers.

112
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.200
Escort us out if we don't be

113
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.300
quiet, but but what happens here is as we

114
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.700
grow increasingly smaller in size.

115
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.200
We have a better opportunity for conversation.

116
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.600
and

117
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.900
intimacy

118
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.800
This is by exactly what happened with me and my wife that

119
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.600
we would be transparent. Oops going back

120
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.100
transparent.

121
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.900
I can't believe I'm telling this story, but I remember where I

122
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.700
was standing on.

123
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.500
The sidewalk in front of her parents house when she

124
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.100
told me she loved me for the first time.

125
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.500
What yeah, some of you like that and others are saying you've

126
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.200
got to stop stay with the curriculum.

127
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.400
But I remember when she told me she loved me and and that didn't

128
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.700
just happen because I talked the whole time but we

129
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.100
it was given take and she was listening and I

130
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.100
was listening to her and I was pouring into

131
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.100
her you've heard people say that I was letting her in to see

132
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.500
who I was and she was letting me and and she

133
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.100
thought hey, I really like this guy to the point. I think I'm

134
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.500
gonna tell him I love him. So and look what happened 42 years later. I'm telling

135
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.500
stories in front of everybody. All right, and then eventually

136
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.400
accountability.

137
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.700
Accountability is is a big help

138
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.900
in the disciples life when you

139
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.200
are in a micro group, and it's a

140
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.100
gender-based micro group. You have the opportunity to share your

141
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.800
fears.

142
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.900
to share your failures

143
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.200
To share your your hopes for

144
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.300
what God is going to be doing with you and through you

145
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.200
and in you.

146
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.400
And you might not have that opportunity in a

147
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.500
community group. You could if your community

148
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.400
group was the right environment but a lot of times because it's

149
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.100
an open group. Sometimes people don't share to that level

150
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.400
of intimacy, but that's what we're trying to create. That is what an

151
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.000
intentional leader is trying to create. All right,

152
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.200
so

153
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.100
Now we're moving. If you will open

154
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.600
up your curriculum to page four of week four.

155
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.300
We're looking at chapter 4

156
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.300
of our book invest in a few and this

157
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.600
is answering the question a three dimensions of what

158
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.600
what is a disciple how to identify a

159
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.900
disciple and here's the first one are they becoming like

160
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.100
Jesus and what that means is

161
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.900
is again going back to our definition.

162
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.400
Is this disciple one who is following Jesus being changed by

163
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.100
Jesus and committed to the mission of Jesus?

164
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.200
Well, let's let's talk about what that means. Exactly. Are

165
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.200
they becoming like Jesus. Think about this Jesus in

166
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.500
his high Priestly prayer in John 17,

167
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.700
praise for himself.

168
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.600
Praise for his disciples and while

169
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.400
he's praying for his disciples in verse 17. He says

170
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.300
this sanctify now, this is Jesus praying a

171
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.600
prayer about you and me

172
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.800
about what he's hoping will happen for

173
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.100
us.

174
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.200
He says sanctify them in the truth.

175
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.700
Your word is truth.

176
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.200
So we have access to the way the truth

177
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.200
and life in Jesus, but we also have access to

178
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.000
the truth. That is God's revealed word. And

179
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.400
so he's saying sanctify them.

180
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.700
In the truth for your word is truth. And then you talk

181
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.400
about living scent as you sent me into

182
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.500
the world. So I have sent them into the

183
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.200
world. So there's a lot of things happening in that verse. First of

184
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.900
all is Jesus prayer for us?

185
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.300
Secondly, he had defines what it means. I want

186
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.900
them to be set apart for a special purpose. That's what sanctification means

187
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.400
to means to be set apart for God's special

188
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.200
use and purpose.

189
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.200
And there are two primary areas according to

190
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.700
Craig Etheridge two primary areas where disciple

191
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.300
needs to be set apart for God's special use and purpose and

192
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.400
that's this the inner character and we're going to Define what

193
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.700
that means and the core competencies and

194
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.500
we're going to Define what that means too. First of all the inner

195
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.400
character. The inner character is having

196
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.300
Christ likeness inside of

197
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:37.500
me.

198
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.700
My personal personal and precisely

199
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.100
accurate opinion. Is this that

200
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.700
your faith should be demonstrated from

201
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.600
the inside out?

202
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.700
Sometimes when we get that upside down and our faith

203
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.100
is demonstrated from the outside and we can become legalistic. We

204
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.300
can become Pious we can become

205
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.200
unlike Christ even doing the

206
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.500
things that Christ has asked us to do even using core

207
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.200
competencies that will be talking about in a minute. I'm thinking

208
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.700
about the story in

209
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.600
the New Testament when the

210
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.500
when the Pharisees said dear God, I thank you

211
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.500
that I'm not like these other sinners.

212
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.400
right

213
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.200
And then Jesus said within there was a sinner who beat his

214
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.200
breast and he said Lord God be merciful to me.

215
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.700
I'm a sinner and Jesus said, who do you think you know?

216
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.500
Who do you think was the right person in the situation? So even when

217
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.300
we are experiencing the core competencies if we don't have

218
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.100
the Inside Out inner character of

219
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.000
Christ than our hearts can be out of whack and

220
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.700
in doing so then we become something less and

221
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.300
maybe even opposite of what a real disciple is for

222
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.500
example.

223
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.400
In the inner character of Christ Paul said to the Philippian

224
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.700
people Let each of you look not only on his own interests,

225
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.500
but also on the interest of others look at this having this

226
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.200
mind among yourselves, which

227
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.100
is yours in Christ Jesus, so we

228
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.800
are to have the mind of Christ and

229
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.400
so as his thoughts are my thoughts.

230
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.500
As his perspective is my perspective as his point

231
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.500
of view is my point of view.

232
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.300
As his attitude the thing

233
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.500
about Philippians 2 for a second.

234
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.200
Let this first verse one says

235
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.300
let this attitude be in you which is also in Christ

236
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:28.600
Jesus.

237
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.600
Okay, so it's even the attitude of Christ is your attitude

238
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.400
and

239
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.500
And then of course the the fruits of the spirit in Galatians

240
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.400
5:22, this is also part of the inner character

241
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.900
of Christ. You've heard of the fruits of the spirit love joy peace,

242
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.300
patience kindness goodness, faithfulness gentleness

243
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.400
and self-control. Let's just do a real

244
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.200
quick. We don't we

245
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.700
don't have to do this. But but I think it's kind of fun. Let's just

246
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:55.900
do a little

247
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.800
Personal confession we'll call this group confession. How

248
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.300
many of you could use a little bit more patience. Anyway, I

249
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.000
see that hand. It's like a billy cram Crusade. I

250
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.100
see that hand. I see that hand how many of it

251
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.300
could use a little bit more kindness.

252
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.100
All right, maybe a few less how many

253
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.100
of it could be a little bit more use a

254
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.500
little bit more to self-control and if you've done three in

255
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.300
a row, you could use himself control right? But no

256
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.700
this is the this is the fruit

257
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.100
of the Holy Spirit against such things.

258
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.600
There is no law. That means is that if we're controlled and

259
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.400
in step with the spirit then we don't

260
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.700
need the law of God reminding us of what's sinful as sinful.

261
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.300
We are we we're free from that because we're

262
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.400
full of the Holy Spirit and walking and keeping in step

263
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.300
with the spirit. Let's go on and those who belong to

264
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.300
Christ. Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and

265
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.200
desires and this is a great way of

266
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.500
thinking in terms of the inner character of Christ.

267
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.300
The heart of Christ if we live by

268
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.400
the spirit, let us also keep step with

269
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.900
the spirit. How many of you remember the term my

270
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.200
walk with Christ?

271
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.300
Right. That's it's a great term. I don't know I won't

272
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.000
use it anymore, but I'm walking.

273
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.600
in step with a spirit

274
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.200
the direction that Christ is calling me to walk with his

275
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.200
attitude with his mind with his

276
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.200
perspective with his thoughts my thoughts

277
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.700
and so that's the inner character. All right, and then

278
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.500
here's a from your author

279
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.700
Craig Etheridge a disciple is growing in these areas of

280
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.700
inner character learning day by

281
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.100
day to let the spirit of God control them change them

282
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.400
and lead them. So what's the goal

283
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.100
of discipleship? It's transformation.

284
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.200
And what is it? How do we Define a disciple one who's

285
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.600
following Jesus one who's being changed by Jesus? And so

286
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.200
we're being changed in our inner character and then

287
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.000
lastly the disciple must develop the core competencies.

288
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.800
And core competencies are having Christ

289
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.400
likeness on the outside and what that means is is

290
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.300
that Jesus trained his disciples and

291
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.400
God's word throughout the gospels. He quoted the scriptures over

292
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.500
70 times. So think about

293
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.300
when he was a 12 year old, right and I'm

294
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.100
laughing because it's not

295
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.600
happened at Henderson Hills for me yet. But every church I've served

296
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.600
at about 12:31 o'clock.

297
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.300
You see a little dude. He's about

298
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:31.800
seven.

299
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.100
And he's walking through the Halls kind of by himself.

300
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.100
And you're like hey, buddy.

301
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.000
Where's your parents and the little guy goes?

302
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.500
And Mama thought daddy took him home and daddy thought

303
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.800
Mama looking and they left him a church.

304
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.500
Right and that's happened a few times. Not at Henderson

305
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.200
Hills yet. Well same thing happened Jesus, but when they come back

306
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.500
to get him, he's in the temple with the Pharisees

307
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.300
talking about the Bible.

308
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.300
And I love this those of you that are

309
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.500
having trouble with your teenagers.

310
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.600
Mary said what are you trying to do to us?

311
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.200
And he asks didn't you know I'd be about

312
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.000
my father's business.

313
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.600
So one of jesus' core competencies is

314
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.600
training his disciples in God's word and probably

315
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.600
the most successful experience I've

316
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.300
had in micro groups is where we

317
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.400
use the scripture as the text. I don't

318
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.000
have any problem with going through a specific book. In fact,

319
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.200
we're probably going to provide some books for those of you who start a

320
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.900
brand new discipleship group Navigators has

321
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.000
got some great work growing in Christ designed for

322
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.500
discipleship lifeways got a great work called knowing God

323
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.400
will provide those things for you out there. You can order them your sales

324
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.200
but perhaps my favorite thing to do is to

325
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.300
say to the micro group. Let's read through the book

326
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.900
of blank together Book of John together this

327
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.500
week. We'll look at chapter one. We're gonna really really

328
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.500
work on chapter one and we'll come back together. We'll

329
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.200
discuss it together and in doing so

330
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.300
you may have more knowledge about the scripture than those that

331
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.800
you are in a disability Group with you're just sharing with them how

332
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.000
to not just read the scripture.

333
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.600
But read it in the right context and then let the

334
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.600
scripture read you so that you know, which questions to

335
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.300
ask that are probing questions and you basically are

336
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.200
as a group of men or women seeking collectively

337
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.300
to find out what is God saying to

338
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.000
us in this passage together and in doing so

339
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.900
you're learning the core competency of God's word scripture

340
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.200
engagement. I've included in

341
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.500
your notes of five different ways that you can study the

342
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.100
scripture read the scripture. Listen to the scripture preached

343
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.100
memorize the scripture you can meditate on

344
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.100
the scripture, but the best way to get to know the scripture

345
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.600
is what

346
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.400
Obey the scripture so you can

347
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.200
look at that at another time the second thing that a core

348
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.200
competency Jesus also trained his disciples how

349
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.400
to pray sometimes Jesus would pray all night

350
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.600
before big decisions or when facing heavy pressures of ministry. If

351
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.200
you ever felt

352
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.500
like I'm not ready for this to be a disciple maker.

353
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.300
Think about the time when Jesus was

354
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.500
In the bottom of the boat asleep, the disciples are

355
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.600
upstairs fighting the storm.

356
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.500
Right and what where's Jesus? He's downstairs

357
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.100
sleep.

358
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.300
And then what does Jesus say when

359
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.700
he comes back up and he says peace be still.

360
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.900
and but he also says

361
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.200
where was your faith?

362
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.400
Where was your faith?

363
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.000
And so you're probably sitting here today saying where's my face? I don't even know

364
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.400
if I won't do this this option thing. Well, I'll say look you just like Jesus

365
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.300
disciples, right? It's it's really

366
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.200
who's the who's the teacher the holy spirit's the

367
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.300
teacher?

368
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.400
And what's the text Will the Bible is the text. We won't

369
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.000
spend a lot of time on this but two other core competencies

370
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.700
that Jesus shared was communicating the

371
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.000
gospel. He modeled public and personal evangelism

372
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.300
and he sent out his disciples two

373
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.400
by two to do the same thing. The kingdom of God is near

374
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.400
But he also trained his disciples how to invest their

375
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.300
lives and others to make disciples as he made

376
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.700
Disciples of them. And so and they did that and and literally

377
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.800
turned the world upside down doing so so

378
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.300
here's the maximum that I want you to memorize

379
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.900
this week last week. We said the holy spirit is the teacher this week.

380
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.200
I want you to memorize the Bible as the curriculum.

381
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.000
Okay, there's lots of great curriculum out there.

382
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.100
I don't have any real problem with that that I think is theologically

383
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.500
sound but but hopefully you'll

384
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.800
get to where you guys are discussing the scripture and

385
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.800
you're learning from the scripture and you're you're a

386
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.300
holy one another accountable to read the scripture together

387
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.200
and you're enjoying it together.

388
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.100
Let's let's keep going.

389
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.200
All right. I had a discussion with a guy

390
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.200
earlier today and he wanted me and

391
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.400
I agree with him a hundred percent. He wanted me to clarify that you

392
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.000
don't actually become a disciple over on this stage.

393
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.100
All right.

394
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.000
But what you are is now you are a intentional disciple

395
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.100
leader in this stage. So but these

396
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.600
this is the disciple making

397
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.600
stages if you will and

398
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.300
last week we talked about is a is a man

399
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.500
of or a woman devoted a crisis because they have been born

400
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.700
again. And now what are they their spiritual infants?

401
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.800
What this tool is this is not a theological Treatise

402
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.600
on salvation theology. All right, this is

403
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.400
basically just a graphic to help you see

404
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.900
where you are in this disciple making Journey. Okay,

405
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.400
when we first are born again,

406
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.600
we are infant Christians a baby Christians

407
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.500
and as cute as we are we don't want to stay that

408
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.300
way. All right. So the second

409
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.400
stage is a spiritual child. What is it about a spiritual child?

410
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.900
Well, they're self-focused.

411
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.500
They they attend a church based upon

412
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.600
what the church can do for them?

413
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.600
they when they read scripture they're saying what is this passage saying

414
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.200
to me and and in doing

415
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:16.800
so it's kind of like

416
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.100
I've got granddaughters and they're just as cute as they

417
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.100
can be but they're selfish just like their mother.

418
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.300
And I know that because I raised their mother that's my daughter

419
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.700
right and you know why she's selfish because she's

420
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.500
just like her daddy, right? So but what

421
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.500
happens is they don't they don't stay as selfish as

422
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.200
they are when their children. Hopefully they grow out of that.

423
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.200
And if they don't you can see there's a real problem with immaturity, but

424
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.300
that's what we're hoping. Is

425
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.700
that eventually because of our involvement with

426
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.900
the people of God and the Church of God and the and the

427
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.700
word of God, then we grow out of our self-focusedness now

428
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.500
to more of a kingdom Focus where others

429
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.500
focused we begin to for the first time thinking in

430
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.900
terms of how can I serve and how can I share and what

431
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.600
can I do to be a part of what God is doing with this

432
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.200
family? Okay. And then what I'm

433
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.000
asking you to do is to to not just

434
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.400
thinking in terms of other Focus, but let's be specific about becoming

435
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.100
an intentional discipleship May

436
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.700
a disciple maker and intentional leader

437
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.700
creating a relational environment

438
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.100
and eventually reproducing

439
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.200
that I want to finish with a text that

440
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.800
I got this morning. I'm not going to read it to you because I don't have permission to do that. But I'm

441
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.200
sitting on the back porch I do this.

442
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:41.800
All Summer Long

443
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.100
All right, I get up before it gets too hot. I have a cup

444
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:45.900
of coffee in my Bible.

445
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.600
And so that's when I do my scripture reading and

446
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.500
and out of nowhere. I get this text from A

447
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.200
discipleship group that I

448
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.800
was involved in in North Dallas.

449
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.300
And I've told you that story well there still meeting

450
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.300
and they were they refuse to take me off the text stream and I

451
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.200
don't disagree because I like seeing what's going on with these guys.

452
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.500
Well, one of them broke away from our

453
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.100
group and started his his own group.

454
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.600
And it didn't go as well as he'd hoped.

455
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.600
Because he remembers how God moved in

456
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.300
this discipleship group and he's waiting to see God

457
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.600
move in this new discipleship micro group and

458
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.500
it's just not happening and they're having a good time and

459
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.900
you know guys breakfast coffee yucking

460
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.400
it up telling stories football games that kind of thing. He's just

461
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.700
not

462
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.200
Appreciating it. He's like no, we we want to

463
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.300
create a relational environment. We want to study God's word. We want to challenge one

464
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.500
another we want to hold one another accountable. How about them Cowboys? You

465
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.800
know, and so he he decides I'm

466
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.600
going back to my first group you guys

467
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.800
can keep doing whatever it is you're doing right and so

468
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.600
I was a little disappointed about that, but I'm an

469
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.900
Edmund now, so I was getting over it.

470
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.000
Well this morning I'm having my Bible study and I'm spending

471
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.500
time with the Lord and I see one

472
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.600
of the guys from his new group

473
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.300
a text him using a group text which

474
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.600
by the way is a tremendous way of in you

475
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:17.600
know.

476
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.200
Upping your clout. It's not just you

477
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.800
privately. He goes. Hey, how come we're on meeting anymore?

478
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.700
And and I I see Rusty's name

479
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.000
Rusty's like well, I didn't know if you

480
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:36.300
guys want to keep meeting. He's like, well, yeah, we're disciple

481
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.200
are we I mean so you can

482
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.500
see the battle in between the the spiritual child

483
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.200
and spiritual young adult the disable maker and

484
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.600
it's like I don't really like the way this is going to go but so I just

485
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.300
want you to see this is the way that discipleship works.

486
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.700
I wish it were simple. I wish you were scratching sniff. Oh

487
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.000
how easy it's not right, but

488
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.700
guess what happens?

489
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.700
I then I see let's say

490
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.300
well, let's let's meet again next week. Let's let's do

491
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.100
it again. And then I send Rusty of

492
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.100
private text message. I said Rusty. I'm so proud of you.

493
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.200
For not giving up on those guys.

494
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.700
For realizing that you're gonna be an intentional leader

495
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.900
and that you're going to do this even when it's not easy and

496
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.400
and then he sends me a text back

497
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.900
and he says you know, what yesterday Phil.

498
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.500
We used to meet on Tuesday mornings and they still do he said

499
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.700
bill.

500
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.300
Asked me do you think Phil would be proud of

501
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.200
what we're doing without him?

502
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.200
And I told Bill I think Phil would

503
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.200
be real proud of what we're doing because we haven't quit and we're

504
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.100
not going to quit and then the very next day. This is

505
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.100
if the Holy Spirit was involved some

506
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.900
How very next days like how are we not meeting?

507
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.400
And he says yeah, we're going to keep meeting.

508
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.400
And so what I'm asking you guys to do is think in

509
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.200
terms of who is God calling you to invest

510
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.900
your life in.

511
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.000
Who?

512
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.300
Have you been praying that prayer I've been asking

513
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.300
the Lord who who have you in your

514
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.100
Divine wisdom identified

515
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.100
for me to join forces

516
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.100
with and create a micro group. And and

517
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.600
I promise you this if you'll be serious asking God

518
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.400
what he would have you do and then you'll be obedient to

519
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.300
follow through with it. It's gonna be exciting. It's

520
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.100
gonna be easy. No,

521
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.600
Is it going to be messy probably?

522
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.300
Is going to be worth it. It literally is life-changing.

523
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.400
I sit down today at lunch actually at 2

524
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.600
o'clock, Joe Williams.

525
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.200
Joe are you here?

526
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.600
There's Joe in the back. I have to change my story now.

527
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.300
Connector and he met a guy at A discipleship meeting.

528
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.200
He says I need to mean he needs to meet Phil.

529
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.200
And so we got together today and we found out that

530
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.700
he and I have been studying the same kind of relational discipleship

531
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.500
making process from the same kinds of leaders for

532
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.100
a very long time. We've never met together. We have lots and

533
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.500
lots of mutual friends, but it was so amazing to listen

534
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.900
to the 67 year old man.

535
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.500
Just brimming with passion for God

536
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.200
changing lives in him getting to be a part

537
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.400
of it.

538
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.600
And to share that heart with him and to

539
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.900
one day be able to share that heart with so many of you.
