00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:09.845
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:14.565
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God,

3
00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:22.885
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth

4
00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:30.725
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

5
00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:38.285
When Christ who is your life appears, then you will also appear with him. And,

6
00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:06.765
Well, happy Sunday Church. Uh, what a blessing it is to get to gather like this.

7
00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:07.565
What a privilege.

8
00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:11.285
Really it is that God has invited us into his presence and we get to do this

9
00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:15.805
every Sunday. Uh, we shouldn't take it for granted for sure. Uh,

10
00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:19.805
today we're continuing through our journey in the New Testament book of

11
00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:20.625
Colossians.

12
00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:23.965
And so you can go ahead and take your copy of God's Word and turn with me to

13
00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:28.325
Colossians chapter three, verse 12, Colossians three,

14
00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:30.485
starting in verse 12. Today as we get into this,

15
00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:34.245
many of you know this about me already, but I don't like coffee.

16
00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:39.605
And so before you start throwing stones at me for that or judging me too

17
00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:43.925
harshly, I, I think I have an excuse. See, a couple years ago, my family,

18
00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:47.365
we had genetic testing done for various reasons. And, and one of the,

19
00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:52.125
the markers that showed up on the genetic testing was related to that.

20
00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:55.965
Actually, I might be wondering how well the nutritionist,

21
00:01:55.965 --> 00:01:56.925
as we sat down with her,

22
00:01:56.985 --> 00:02:01.965
she said that this one specific line of code makes bitter things taste

23
00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:06.685
more bitter. So she could have been completely pulling my chain.

24
00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:09.885
I don't know how, if that's true or not, but I'm gonna hold onto that one. Okay?

25
00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:13.685
Like it's in my DNA that I feel like that, um, no, but think about it.

26
00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:16.405
If we could somehow go in and,

27
00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:21.205
and we could change that specific line of code, then,

28
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:26.045
then I would flip the switch and I would be all in on pumpkin spice

29
00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:29.085
lattes, fra double shots, white espresso, whatever.

30
00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:31.765
I don't even know how to order that. Okay? But, but that's how it works.

31
00:02:31.765 --> 00:02:36.525
Somehow I would be excited and it would taste good to me at that point.

32
00:02:36.525 --> 00:02:41.325
Listen, that's similar to how the old self

33
00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:44.885
versus new self works in our lives.

34
00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:51.955
See, in our old flesh driven sinful self that we are born into,

35
00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:56.395
that we live in, in light of our sin nature in that state,

36
00:02:56.495 --> 00:03:01.085
we don't enjoy things like patience and

37
00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:03.405
kindness and forgiveness.

38
00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:08.715
But when God makes us a new creation,

39
00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:15.515
he rewires and empowers our hearts to pursue those

40
00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:19.395
things. Now those things actually fit us. We, we,

41
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:23.795
we taste those well now they taste good to us.

42
00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:29.765
That's what we're gonna see today. If it, if we saw last week, this old self,

43
00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:35.005
today we're gonna see the stark contrast to what we see in

44
00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:38.605
God's work in us. That, that the old self was dominated by sin.

45
00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:40.685
It was directed by the ways of the world.

46
00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:45.725
It was standing against God in so many ways. The new self is totally different.

47
00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:50.435
Look now at Colossians three, verses 12 through 17,

48
00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:53.155
this new self he describes

49
00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:59.165
put on then as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved,

50
00:03:59.995 --> 00:04:03.405
compassionate hearts, kindness, humility,

51
00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:07.925
meekness and patience bearing with one another.

52
00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:10.405
And if one has a complaint against another,

53
00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:14.585
forgiving each other as the Lord has forgiven you.

54
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:19.435
So you also must forgive. And above all of these,

55
00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:23.635
put on love which binds everything together in perfect harmony.

56
00:04:25.045 --> 00:04:29.665
And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which

57
00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:33.505
indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful.

58
00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:39.635
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly teaching and admonishing one another

59
00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:40.528
in all wisdom.

60
00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:45.795
Singing Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your

61
00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:50.635
hearts to God. And whatever you do in word or deed,

62
00:04:50.935 --> 00:04:53.635
do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,

63
00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:59.275
giving thanks to God the Father through him. Lord,

64
00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:04.195
we need you to show us from your word what you

65
00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:05.955
want us to be like.

66
00:05:08.035 --> 00:05:12.315
I pray you'd remove any barriers in our arts and our minds clarify,

67
00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:14.795
awaken us if we need it today,

68
00:05:15.035 --> 00:05:19.975
that we would see clearly the difference between the old and

69
00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:23.915
the new that you have done in us. Help us God.

70
00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:26.515
In Jesus' name. Amen.

71
00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:31.375
So you remember that this passage does not happen in isolation.

72
00:05:31.605 --> 00:05:33.855
Like we're not just pulling this out of nowhere.

73
00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:39.095
This must be taken in context that these believers in Colossae were in the midst

74
00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:41.815
of a depraved, pluralistic culture.

75
00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.215
A lot of different things they were hearing and saying.

76
00:05:44.275 --> 00:05:49.255
And as Paul reminded the church of the Gospel and of the fact that Christ is

77
00:05:49.255 --> 00:05:52.055
above all competitors, what he was saying here,

78
00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:55.735
he's saying what that does is it changes you.

79
00:05:55.835 --> 00:05:58.645
It actually creates a new life in you.

80
00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:02.405
It changes you to reflect Christ's power.

81
00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:05.098
But that was hard.

82
00:06:06.495 --> 00:06:11.055
To live that out in that situation was hard. It's still hard.

83
00:06:12.175 --> 00:06:16.395
And so that's why he needed to start with the reasons they can put on the new

84
00:06:16.395 --> 00:06:19.955
self. So we started with with why they are able.

85
00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:21.915
What is the reason you can,

86
00:06:22.055 --> 00:06:26.395
how is it possible that you can put on this new self, live a new life,

87
00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:30.555
put on the new robe of christlikeness? How can you,

88
00:06:32.015 --> 00:06:34.865
well, we looked at this last week in verse 10 above.

89
00:06:36.315 --> 00:06:38.895
Go back up there just a couple verses ahead of where we are today.

90
00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:42.095
Not only have you put off the old self, that was verse nine,

91
00:06:42.555 --> 00:06:46.295
but verse 10 and have put on the new self,

92
00:06:46.905 --> 00:06:50.935
which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.

93
00:06:52.685 --> 00:06:54.985
And so this has already happened. It says,

94
00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:59.345
so not only have you put off the old self that if you are a new creation by

95
00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:04.145
faith in Jesus' life, death and resurrection, then what you see here,

96
00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:09.385
he's now reforming you for him, right?

97
00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:11.345
We saw that he's reformed.

98
00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:15.745
You are reformed in the new creation for him. Now

99
00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:21.845
he's making you into the image in which you were originally intended to live,

100
00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:26.965
which is his image, that image that perfectly displayed in Jesus.

101
00:07:26.965 --> 00:07:30.365
Colossians one 15. He's saying, this is what you should be like now

102
00:07:31.895 --> 00:07:35.735
increasingly over your life. And so what the saying by this, again,

103
00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:39.415
the reason you can put on the new self is because you are new already.

104
00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:44.015
That means you can put on the new self live like that because you already are.

105
00:07:45.025 --> 00:07:46.035
Just live it out now.

106
00:07:46.035 --> 00:07:49.355
Just kind of take what you already are and live it out daily.

107
00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:56.695
But then you look again at verse 12, the first few words it says put on.

108
00:07:56.695 --> 00:07:59.415
Then that then is tracking us back to verse 10.

109
00:07:59.555 --> 00:08:04.055
Put on then as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved

110
00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:09.025
as meaning. You already are these things. So just live it out.

111
00:08:09.025 --> 00:08:13.505
You can put on the new self. What kind of things? Well, first he says,

112
00:08:13.605 --> 00:08:16.505
you are God's chosen ones.

113
00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:20.685
God's chosen ones.

114
00:08:23.365 --> 00:08:26.885
I want you to hear the way he says it in the parallel book to this,

115
00:08:26.885 --> 00:08:29.845
which is Ephesians. This is Ephesians one, verses three through six.

116
00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:34.665
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

117
00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:38.505
who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly

118
00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:39.338
places,

119
00:08:39.495 --> 00:08:43.705
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world,

120
00:08:44.055 --> 00:08:47.905
that we should be holy and blameless before him. Sounds familiar,

121
00:08:47.905 --> 00:08:50.005
right in love.

122
00:08:50.025 --> 00:08:54.765
He predestined us for adoption to himself as sons

123
00:08:54.765 --> 00:08:58.005
through Jesus Christ according to the purpose of his will,

124
00:08:58.225 --> 00:09:02.765
to the praise of his glorious grace with which he's blessed us in the beloved.

125
00:09:05.005 --> 00:09:08.865
So I want you just to stop and think for a second how stunning that reality is

126
00:09:10.715 --> 00:09:15.545
that a holy God would choose to make sinful

127
00:09:15.545 --> 00:09:17.145
humans a part of his family,

128
00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:24.315
just stop and think holy other pure.

129
00:09:24.695 --> 00:09:27.795
And he says, no, I'm gonna take sinful humans and make them a part of my family.

130
00:09:27.905 --> 00:09:32.475
Plus he would pay the cost for that to happen with his very son's life.

131
00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:41.305
And he didn't have to do it like we're not good enough that he had to.

132
00:09:41.445 --> 00:09:46.405
He could have, he had the right to save nobody. He's holy.

133
00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:50.005
We're not. He could have just said no to everything, but because he loves

134
00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:55.185
'cause of his grace, he does save,

135
00:09:58.525 --> 00:10:02.635
but he doesn't just choose and then leave you hanging right here.

136
00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:05.955
You're a part of my family now. And then you figure it out yourself. No,

137
00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:10.195
what does it say? He also makes you. Verse 12 says, holy and beloved.

138
00:10:11.495 --> 00:10:15.315
So God's chosen once, holy and beloved.

139
00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:18.775
Now, that word beloved, we don't use very often,

140
00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:23.975
but that word in the original language means cherished,

141
00:10:26.045 --> 00:10:26.878
treasured

142
00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:31.885
that you hold something in high esteem.

143
00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:37.905
And so I don't know what you walked in here with today,

144
00:10:39.425 --> 00:10:42.075
what your past has told you. You are the enemy tells you, you are

145
00:10:43.595 --> 00:10:45.395
that Christian.

146
00:10:46.505 --> 00:10:49.275
That is how your heavenly Father views you.

147
00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:55.095
Beloved cherished, treasured.

148
00:10:56.185 --> 00:10:59.885
That's how he views you as you're, he's making you a new creation.

149
00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:02.645
You've believed he's made you right before him.

150
00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:07.525
He's made you holy before him and he's made you his treasured child.

151
00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:14.175
Does that not stir your affection for him then

152
00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:19.395
that he had every right to kick you out and keep you out? And he said, no,

153
00:11:19.395 --> 00:11:23.835
you're gonna be my child. I choose you. I'm adopting you. I'm making you holy.

154
00:11:23.935 --> 00:11:27.595
I'm making you blameless. I'm making you mine. He says,

155
00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:36.385
so when you think about it, you are new,

156
00:11:37.795 --> 00:11:40.815
you're chosen by God, you're holy and beloved by God.

157
00:11:40.925 --> 00:11:43.495
That means you can put on the new self.

158
00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:48.515
He's given you the ability to do that. But it's also reality that you should

159
00:11:50.095 --> 00:11:54.005
like not only can you, you should put on the new self.

160
00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:59.335
Why? Why should you put on the new self? Well, back to verse 11.

161
00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:02.775
I mentioned this briefly last week. Colossians three 11.

162
00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:07.155
Listen to what it says here.

163
00:12:07.725 --> 00:12:11.155
There is not Greek and Jews, circumcised, uncircumcised, barbarians,

164
00:12:11.155 --> 00:12:14.795
gith and slave free. But Christ is all and in all.

165
00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:17.955
Now we're gonna talk a lot about that verse next week when we get to

166
00:12:17.955 --> 00:12:21.115
relationships. But, but look at the little word that starts verse 11.

167
00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:23.285
It says here,

168
00:12:23.985 --> 00:12:28.605
that's an adverb of location which refers here to the

169
00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:33.345
sphere of the new self. Like he's made you new,

170
00:12:33.365 --> 00:12:37.425
you are new. So here in this arena, in this state,

171
00:12:39.055 --> 00:12:40.195
here's where it plays out.

172
00:12:40.215 --> 00:12:43.435
So this is what I referred to last week as I called the new creation kingdom.

173
00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:46.955
So why should you put on the new self?

174
00:12:47.105 --> 00:12:52.035
Because you are in this new creation kingdom now.

175
00:12:55.235 --> 00:12:57.695
Now what's that? That's his rule and reign in his people.

176
00:12:57.715 --> 00:13:01.575
That's God's oversight and control and, and direction.

177
00:13:01.845 --> 00:13:05.295
Both individually in our lives we're members of his kingdom,

178
00:13:05.435 --> 00:13:07.895
but also collectively we are his kingdom.

179
00:13:08.415 --> 00:13:11.415
A new creation group of people together.

180
00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:14.035
So why should you?

181
00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:18.315
Because he has made you new and in this kingdom,

182
00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:19.555
this is how you do it.

183
00:13:21.655 --> 00:13:25.385
That means the rest of this that we'll see today and all the way through the

184
00:13:25.385 --> 00:13:30.145
next few chapters is showing us what this new creation kingdom

185
00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:31.068
looks like.

186
00:13:33.175 --> 00:13:37.505
That this is the arena in which you are to live out the new kingdom's values.

187
00:13:38.655 --> 00:13:41.385
It's not the kingdom of this here that we should live for.

188
00:13:41.845 --> 00:13:45.975
His kingdom is what we now live for. Okay?

189
00:13:45.975 --> 00:13:48.335
So then the question is, what does it look like to put on the new self?

190
00:13:49.355 --> 00:13:52.815
We know we can. We know we should. Okay, what does that look like?

191
00:13:53.825 --> 00:13:54.805
How do we do this? What?

192
00:13:54.915 --> 00:13:59.005
What does it look like for us to live out these values?

193
00:14:01.655 --> 00:14:05.265
Well, when you look back to Colossians three, 12 through 17, what I read before,

194
00:14:06.485 --> 00:14:11.165
you see the word heart show up twice. So the first

195
00:14:12.815 --> 00:14:15.605
arena this plays out is in our hearts.

196
00:14:17.425 --> 00:14:20.685
And really you could make the argument that all of it stems from the attitude of

197
00:14:20.685 --> 00:14:25.645
your heart, right? That this, this plays out. So how do we put on the new self?

198
00:14:25.645 --> 00:14:28.205
What does it look like? Well, first it happens in our hearts.

199
00:14:28.405 --> 00:14:33.005
'cause remember what Jesus said back in Luke 6 45. I know you have all that.

200
00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:35.765
All of you have that memorized, but lemme just remind you of that.

201
00:14:35.835 --> 00:14:37.845
Luke 6 45 says,

202
00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:42.325
the good person outta the good treasure of his heart produces good.

203
00:14:43.285 --> 00:14:46.945
And the evil person outta the evil treasure produces evil

204
00:14:48.115 --> 00:14:52.565
For out of the abundance of the heart, his his mouth speaks.

205
00:14:54.445 --> 00:14:55.465
What's Jesus teaching?

206
00:14:55.465 --> 00:14:58.025
He's teaching that what's in there is eventually gonna come out.

207
00:14:59.845 --> 00:15:04.335
This controls, this drives from here is what happens out there,

208
00:15:05.035 --> 00:15:08.005
whether that's good or bad, whether that's new self or old self,

209
00:15:08.005 --> 00:15:10.725
what's in there is going to show up.

210
00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:16.695
And so what we see in Colossians three last week, five through 11,

211
00:15:17.035 --> 00:15:20.935
was when the old self, the old heart is in there. That's what you get.

212
00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:25.095
Now this is, this is the new heart. This is what the new self looks like.

213
00:15:27.145 --> 00:15:30.445
So verse 12, you see compassionate hearts,

214
00:15:31.835 --> 00:15:36.765
there's a compassionate heart, meaning when someone else hurts, you hurt.

215
00:15:37.685 --> 00:15:42.275
That's what compassion is In the old self,

216
00:15:42.335 --> 00:15:44.355
we were pleased when someone else hurt, right?

217
00:15:45.495 --> 00:15:48.545
Felt good when we made someone else painful or when they were walking through

218
00:15:48.545 --> 00:15:52.465
life and they, they missed the the field goal, right? Like that's it feels,

219
00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:55.265
it feels good when they suffer.

220
00:15:56.805 --> 00:16:00.425
Now the new self is what Jesus did when he saw the lost helpless crowd around.

221
00:16:00.425 --> 00:16:03.905
What did he do? He had compassion on them. He hurt for them.

222
00:16:05.385 --> 00:16:06.485
That's new self stuff.

223
00:16:09.345 --> 00:16:11.165
He also says kindness here.

224
00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:15.855
Part of the heart change that Galatians five says is a fruit of God's spirit

225
00:16:15.855 --> 00:16:17.175
working in you. What is kindness?

226
00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:23.525
Kindness is rather than being selfish and wanting people to serve you,

227
00:16:24.505 --> 00:16:28.685
you're warm and you're sweet as you serve other people,

228
00:16:30.525 --> 00:16:34.575
you don't have an edge to you. If you know what I mean by that.

229
00:16:35.575 --> 00:16:39.025
You're kind people love to be around you.

230
00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:45.515
Verse 12 also says, humility. This is part of the new heart,

231
00:16:45.695 --> 00:16:47.555
is what Philippians two, three says.

232
00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:50.315
Counting others more significant than yourselves.

233
00:16:50.615 --> 00:16:53.275
That's new heart stuff that you're humble,

234
00:16:53.275 --> 00:16:55.835
where you're putting a priority on others more than yourself.

235
00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:03.505
He also says, another aspect of this heart change is meekness. Again,

236
00:17:03.505 --> 00:17:06.985
we don't use that ver word very much, but verse 12 says, meekness,

237
00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:10.505
which is not what we might tend to think of. Passivity,

238
00:17:12.225 --> 00:17:16.715
meek kind of just weak. No meekness is strength under control.

239
00:17:18.825 --> 00:17:23.555
It's the same word that Jesus uses in Matthew 11 when he says he is gentle.

240
00:17:24.575 --> 00:17:29.415
Meekness is the same word there. And so when you think about Jesus, remember he,

241
00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:32.335
he flipped tables. He called out hypocrisy.

242
00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:38.295
But meekness means he knew when to deploy his strength.

243
00:17:39.835 --> 00:17:43.295
And he was talking about it in a way that he knew how he knew.

244
00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:48.295
He knew how to deploy his strength to protect, to care for the hurting.

245
00:17:48.595 --> 00:17:51.885
That's when he used his strength. But other than that, he was under control.

246
00:17:52.795 --> 00:17:56.905
He was meek. That's new heart stuff in us.

247
00:17:59.325 --> 00:18:02.705
And then he says Patience. That last word in verse 12, patience.

248
00:18:03.565 --> 00:18:08.265
That's one aspect of the hig piff unity that we must maintain in the church,

249
00:18:08.275 --> 00:18:11.985
right? Humility, generalist, patience, forbearance. That's Ephesians four.

250
00:18:12.805 --> 00:18:13.905
To maintain unity,

251
00:18:14.125 --> 00:18:18.985
we must have patience with one another because we are all still in

252
00:18:18.985 --> 00:18:21.345
the renewal process of the new self.

253
00:18:23.915 --> 00:18:25.705
We're not finished yet. That's Philippians one,

254
00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:30.265
six that's coming someday when Jesus returns will be finished until that time

255
00:18:30.265 --> 00:18:32.505
comes. Two Corinthians three 18 says,

256
00:18:32.505 --> 00:18:36.705
it's God's spirit who works in us to conform us to the image of Christ.

257
00:18:36.925 --> 00:18:40.945
And that's a lifelong process. We're not conformed fully yet.

258
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:44.625
So I can't expect you to be something you're not yet

259
00:18:47.245 --> 00:18:51.575
that, that you'll be five years from now. But you're not able to be that yet.

260
00:18:51.835 --> 00:18:56.395
God is still working on you to make you what you ought to be. Right?

261
00:18:56.395 --> 00:19:00.275
That's his process of sanctification. That means I must be patient

262
00:19:02.215 --> 00:19:06.685
parenting, right? Be patient with our kids as they grow,

263
00:19:06.685 --> 00:19:09.605
that they can be expected to do more and more as you grow.

264
00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:13.965
But it's not for a five year old to be expected to do what an 18 year old can

265
00:19:16.715 --> 00:19:19.705
allow God to work in us to grow.

266
00:19:21.715 --> 00:19:22.855
He says in verse 15,

267
00:19:22.915 --> 00:19:26.215
and part of this heart change in the new self is that we are to let the peace of

268
00:19:26.215 --> 00:19:30.575
Christ, the peace coming from Christ rule in our hearts.

269
00:19:30.575 --> 00:19:34.735
That means it has control our, here's what that means.

270
00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:35.735
Our default,

271
00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:41.215
when we experience differences between brothers and sisters,

272
00:19:41.395 --> 00:19:46.295
our default should be to let the peace of Christ rule it has

273
00:19:46.295 --> 00:19:49.925
control. It says how it goes, right? That should be first.

274
00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:53.165
That's the new heart. New self is peace.

275
00:19:55.635 --> 00:19:59.565
Even the word of Christ. Verse 16 is to dwell in you richly.

276
00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:01.165
That's in your hearts, right? We're talking,

277
00:20:01.315 --> 00:20:04.445
this is the first sphere that the new self works is in your heart.

278
00:20:04.665 --> 00:20:06.245
The word of Christ dwells.

279
00:20:06.245 --> 00:20:10.285
It's given room in the deepest part of who you are.

280
00:20:11.435 --> 00:20:14.175
It directs, it instructs. It says, this is how you do this.

281
00:20:14.175 --> 00:20:17.135
This is how you don't do this. It guides our decisions.

282
00:20:17.135 --> 00:20:19.095
It instructs us how to respond to each other.

283
00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:22.415
The word of Christ has to dwell deep within us,

284
00:20:25.635 --> 00:20:29.465
which leads to a heart of thanksgiving three times in the last three verses I

285
00:20:29.465 --> 00:20:34.265
read, Thanksgiving shows up, which in dark circumstances is hard.

286
00:20:34.445 --> 00:20:37.465
But that means your heart has to be different.

287
00:20:38.355 --> 00:20:42.325
When you face hard times that you can still see God's goodness in it.

288
00:20:42.385 --> 00:20:45.925
That's the heart of thanksgiving. The new heart.

289
00:20:45.925 --> 00:20:50.365
That's what the new new self looks like internally, that the heart's different.

290
00:20:50.555 --> 00:20:54.215
What comes out of you is different then, right? It's got a new core,

291
00:20:54.235 --> 00:20:56.215
it has new tastes, right?

292
00:20:56.215 --> 00:21:01.175
The DNA structure has changed to taste these things as good as before it

293
00:21:01.175 --> 00:21:05.895
wasn't. And when you think about all of that,

294
00:21:05.895 --> 00:21:06.775
about the heart,

295
00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:12.455
think about then how different our relationships would be as a result of that,

296
00:21:13.945 --> 00:21:16.255
right? If that's a new heart,

297
00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:20.975
if that's the new self within us, dominated controlling us,

298
00:21:21.345 --> 00:21:25.015
think how different our relationships would then be.

299
00:21:27.665 --> 00:21:30.165
If you read carefully as I was looking through this,

300
00:21:30.185 --> 00:21:32.965
you notice this entire passage is plural,

301
00:21:35.565 --> 00:21:38.715
which means that it's about the life of the church.

302
00:21:40.025 --> 00:21:44.915
It's about the life of believers living together, the new covenant,

303
00:21:44.915 --> 00:21:48.235
kingdom citizens that we are. We're living it out together,

304
00:21:48.455 --> 00:21:50.755
not just you on your own. This is us.

305
00:21:53.155 --> 00:21:57.535
And this is so critical because of what Jesus said in John 13,

306
00:21:59.105 --> 00:22:03.555
that a new commandment I give to you that you love one another just as I have

307
00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:06.915
loved you. You also are to one another.

308
00:22:08.265 --> 00:22:09.245
And by this,

309
00:22:10.575 --> 00:22:14.555
all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another.

310
00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:22.365
In other words, the way we interact proves our faith to the world.

311
00:22:22.895 --> 00:22:26.435
We're not. That's what Jesus said.

312
00:22:27.935 --> 00:22:31.955
That's why Paul in Colossians three is so firm

313
00:22:33.065 --> 00:22:37.675
about the way our relationships are to be so different than the ways of the

314
00:22:37.675 --> 00:22:38.508
world.

315
00:22:42.265 --> 00:22:45.315
Look at this. Verse 13. He says,

316
00:22:45.455 --> 00:22:47.315
we are to bear with one another.

317
00:22:48.095 --> 00:22:52.835
And if one has a complaint against another for forgive each other,

318
00:22:55.855 --> 00:23:00.135
here's our natural tendency. When we have a complaint against someone,

319
00:23:01.155 --> 00:23:04.255
we go talk to a bunch of other people and we rally the troops and get 'em on our

320
00:23:04.255 --> 00:23:05.088
side,

321
00:23:05.965 --> 00:23:09.505
and we start to create camps and start to create factions and say,

322
00:23:09.715 --> 00:23:13.665
we're all against them. Listen, that is the wrong way to do it.

323
00:23:17.285 --> 00:23:19.905
Our first instinct should be one of forgiveness.

324
00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:24.655
Our first instinct should be one to let go of the complaint.

325
00:23:24.655 --> 00:23:26.055
That's what it says now. Now,

326
00:23:26.055 --> 00:23:30.535
will you still feel the sting of someone hurting you or wronging you?

327
00:23:30.915 --> 00:23:31.748
Yes.

328
00:23:32.075 --> 00:23:36.895
But what this means is that you forfeit your right to express

329
00:23:37.045 --> 00:23:40.725
your anger, to parade your hurt,

330
00:23:41.025 --> 00:23:43.685
to demand reparation now.

331
00:23:45.815 --> 00:23:49.635
Now this doesn't say you can't lovingly confront that person over the wrong,

332
00:23:49.635 --> 00:23:51.995
they've committed against you. That's Matthew 18.

333
00:23:52.095 --> 00:23:55.955
It just means you go about it with kindness and patience.

334
00:23:56.295 --> 00:24:00.435
You remove the log in your eye as you go to them for their speck in theirs.

335
00:24:01.185 --> 00:24:02.018
Plus,

336
00:24:04.115 --> 00:24:06.655
I'm not saying that you have to trust them immediately.

337
00:24:07.995 --> 00:24:11.715
'cause trust is earned over time. Forgiveness happens. Trust is built.

338
00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:18.085
But listen, when you are hurt and you initiate forgiveness,

339
00:24:19.995 --> 00:24:24.125
that reflects God's character and it reflects this

340
00:24:24.355 --> 00:24:27.165
distinctive trait of the new covenant kingdom

341
00:24:28.715 --> 00:24:32.095
of how we interact, of how we are to be with one another.

342
00:24:32.245 --> 00:24:36.235
Everybody else out there, the way of the world is resentment.

343
00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:38.195
A cycle of revenge.

344
00:24:39.925 --> 00:24:41.775
What if we were different here?

345
00:24:45.905 --> 00:24:50.355
What if this became our mantra that as the Lord has forgiven me,

346
00:24:50.935 --> 00:24:52.275
so I'm going to forgive you?

347
00:24:52.625 --> 00:24:56.635
What if that became what we lived out the gospel truth of that,

348
00:24:56.705 --> 00:25:01.235
what if that became the dominant way of speaking and living?

349
00:25:04.615 --> 00:25:06.835
Here's what I know would happen. There'd be less gossip,

350
00:25:09.525 --> 00:25:13.815
there'd be fewer side eye glances on Sundays when you're here in the same

351
00:25:13.975 --> 00:25:18.535
building together. There'd be fewer broken relationships.

352
00:25:20.505 --> 00:25:22.115
There'd be fewer church splits.

353
00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:29.405
If this became our driving force, we must be better at this church.

354
00:25:32.355 --> 00:25:34.875
'cause listen, if we can't figure this out, who else can?

355
00:25:37.485 --> 00:25:42.265
If we have been forgiven by a holy God, if we can't figure this out,

356
00:25:42.725 --> 00:25:47.545
who else can? And if we don't, the world does not see Christ's love.

357
00:25:52.035 --> 00:25:53.935
And listen, don't think I'm up here. Self righteously,

358
00:25:53.935 --> 00:25:55.055
just condemning everybody else.

359
00:25:57.045 --> 00:25:59.375
This has been a problem in my extended family.

360
00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:07.565
This has been a problem on every single church staff I've ever served on in my

361
00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:08.398
whole life.

362
00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:16.025
We have to be better and listen,

363
00:26:16.085 --> 00:26:20.305
the only way we can get there is not, we can't just like choose. Yeah,

364
00:26:20.325 --> 00:26:22.785
I'm gonna do that now. No, the only way we get to that kind of culture,

365
00:26:23.045 --> 00:26:27.705
the only way we could ever walk in unity and perfect harmony as it says,

366
00:26:27.705 --> 00:26:30.705
verse 14 is if we put on love,

367
00:26:33.855 --> 00:26:37.475
one Corinthians 13, 13 says, love is the greatest of all.

368
00:26:38.455 --> 00:26:40.865
It's what he says here. It's above all.

369
00:26:41.295 --> 00:26:44.365
Love is what binds everything together.

370
00:26:46.435 --> 00:26:50.545
How does it do that? Because God is love

371
00:26:52.835 --> 00:26:57.575
and because Jesus in love sacrificed himself

372
00:26:58.355 --> 00:27:01.975
for us, because he loves, he came and died.

373
00:27:02.155 --> 00:27:05.295
So when we model that to one another,

374
00:27:07.415 --> 00:27:11.025
when we willingly self-sacrifice for the good of someone else,

375
00:27:11.295 --> 00:27:14.425
even when they don't deserve it, even when they could never pay us back.

376
00:27:14.535 --> 00:27:16.625
When we do that because we love,

377
00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:20.865
that's what knits us together as one body. Verse 15 says,

378
00:27:21.215 --> 00:27:24.075
because God is love. That's what he does. That's his.

379
00:27:24.735 --> 00:27:27.675
His whole character is love. And so he says,

380
00:27:27.775 --> 00:27:29.915
you do that and it's going to work.

381
00:27:31.055 --> 00:27:35.595
And it shows the world that we are a redeemed new creation.

382
00:27:35.935 --> 00:27:40.395
People all living out this new self of God together.

383
00:27:42.155 --> 00:27:46.435
It's what forgiveness does. It's what love does.

384
00:27:49.475 --> 00:27:54.465
So you see this relational difference that's

385
00:27:54.665 --> 00:27:56.305
supposed to be in the church,

386
00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:04.635
which even leads then, I mean, just stop. Just stop and think about that.

387
00:28:05.895 --> 00:28:09.105
If there's no broken relationships,

388
00:28:10.945 --> 00:28:13.825
if everybody's walking in love that's binding us together in unity,

389
00:28:15.715 --> 00:28:18.215
how sweet a place that is to be, right?

390
00:28:20.285 --> 00:28:23.945
That's what then people look at and say, what do you guys have?

391
00:28:25.395 --> 00:28:26.495
What's different about you?

392
00:28:26.655 --> 00:28:31.535
I wanna be a part of that because it is so sweet to be

393
00:28:32.135 --> 00:28:36.845
together. And what that does is it leads to a culture of celebration,

394
00:28:38.055 --> 00:28:42.835
life giving joy. And that's what we see.

395
00:28:42.935 --> 00:28:46.515
He even talks about here in verse 16, that that this new self,

396
00:28:46.615 --> 00:28:49.595
the way it plays out among us, the way it changes our interactions,

397
00:28:49.855 --> 00:28:54.395
it then even affects our worship in here.

398
00:28:56.095 --> 00:29:00.195
As we gather in all kinds of other circles and dynamics out there,

399
00:29:00.295 --> 00:29:04.875
it changes even our worship. It overflows that kind of inward heart.

400
00:29:05.135 --> 00:29:08.435
Our relational context overflows into our worship gatherings.

401
00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:11.575
We look at verse 16 again.

402
00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:15.565
Let the word of Christ dwell in you.

403
00:29:15.825 --> 00:29:19.205
Richly teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom,

404
00:29:19.745 --> 00:29:24.525
St singing Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts

405
00:29:25.105 --> 00:29:25.938
to God.

406
00:29:27.505 --> 00:29:31.115
This is the responsiveness to God's word that he does and creates in us.

407
00:29:31.135 --> 00:29:35.435
It creates disciple makers, admonishing, changing, teaching,

408
00:29:35.585 --> 00:29:39.865
instructing each other. By the way, every one of you can do that.

409
00:29:39.865 --> 00:29:44.685
That's a disciple making mentality is you are called to do that with others.

410
00:29:47.045 --> 00:29:51.425
But then it also leads us to sing out of the overflow of our hearts.

411
00:29:53.985 --> 00:29:58.875
And notice this says that this singing should

412
00:29:58.895 --> 00:30:02.595
be able to happen regardless of the style.

413
00:30:04.625 --> 00:30:08.385
'cause he mentions three styles, right? Psalms, hymns, spiritual songs,

414
00:30:09.215 --> 00:30:13.325
those are all stylistic differences, different content in those things.

415
00:30:13.505 --> 00:30:14.338
And he says,

416
00:30:15.745 --> 00:30:19.445
we should be able to sing passionately to any of it.

417
00:30:21.775 --> 00:30:25.355
Why? Because we have thankfulness in our hearts to God,

418
00:30:25.905 --> 00:30:30.235
because it's in there, because we want to express it to him. We've been changed.

419
00:30:30.245 --> 00:30:33.275
We've been given so much by God. Like let's just express it.

420
00:30:33.295 --> 00:30:36.635
It doesn't matter what it is or how it is, I'm gonna sing.

421
00:30:39.185 --> 00:30:41.205
But you might be sitting there saying, I'm not a singer.

422
00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:47.865
Or you might say in general, like men just, people just don't sing anymore.

423
00:30:47.865 --> 00:30:49.425
Especially men. Men don't sing

424
00:30:51.825 --> 00:30:55.235
well as my friend Lee Corso says, not so fast, my friend,

425
00:30:57.285 --> 00:30:59.115
while I was on sabbatical a couple months ago,

426
00:30:59.155 --> 00:31:04.115
I had the privilege of attending a massive worship service where everyone

427
00:31:04.235 --> 00:31:08.835
was singing men, women, children, and singing loudly.

428
00:31:10.255 --> 00:31:13.715
In fact, I was, I was so moved by the experience, I just had to record it.

429
00:31:13.715 --> 00:31:16.195
And so I, I'm gonna show us that here for a second.

430
00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:25.795
Get the video going. You can hear it.

431
00:31:31.185 --> 00:31:32.605
You got the video there. It is

432
00:31:57.005 --> 00:32:01.095
powerful, isn't it? Of course.

433
00:32:01.635 --> 00:32:03.655
I'm being somewhat facetious here.

434
00:32:05.885 --> 00:32:10.775
That was Newcastle United celebrating going to the Champions league in

435
00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:11.708
May.

436
00:32:12.555 --> 00:32:17.285
And that was 50,000 people the entire game,

437
00:32:17.795 --> 00:32:22.125
long singing, chanting, all in unison,

438
00:32:23.105 --> 00:32:23.938
all together.

439
00:32:27.535 --> 00:32:31.925
And so you see that people do sing.

440
00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:38.175
Why do those people sing like that? Because it's in their hearts.

441
00:32:39.935 --> 00:32:42.305
Because they find their identity in that team.

442
00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:48.065
And because they're joining together with 49,999 other people

443
00:32:49.235 --> 00:32:52.535
who all have it in their hearts, who are all passionate about the same thing,

444
00:32:52.535 --> 00:32:56.455
finding their identity in that team. And they're saying, let's celebrate this.

445
00:33:01.025 --> 00:33:05.715
So you can't tell me people won't sing. It's just not in our hearts.

446
00:33:07.535 --> 00:33:09.585
It's just not deep down in there.

447
00:33:09.715 --> 00:33:13.065
We're not as passionate about God as we think we are.

448
00:33:13.115 --> 00:33:15.985
We're not truly thankful for all that he's done for us,

449
00:33:17.235 --> 00:33:19.885
whether it's Psalms, hymns, or spiritual P songs. It doesn't matter.

450
00:33:20.205 --> 00:33:24.205
I am going to celebrate the fact of God is who he says he is.

451
00:33:24.305 --> 00:33:26.045
And I have been saved by him.

452
00:33:33.285 --> 00:33:36.045
I think we're more concerned about what other people think about us than what we

453
00:33:36.045 --> 00:33:38.845
want to do to respond to our God and Savior. That's right.

454
00:33:43.565 --> 00:33:45.465
But did you see it here in Colossians three?

455
00:33:45.695 --> 00:33:49.305
Part of what it means to put on the new self is that you are singing.

456
00:33:51.665 --> 00:33:53.045
You don't have to be on American idol.

457
00:33:53.585 --> 00:33:57.245
You don't have to be on the voice and prove yourself. You are singing to him,

458
00:33:57.695 --> 00:34:02.005
right? Did you see it to God thankfulness. It's in your hearts to God,

459
00:34:02.025 --> 00:34:06.705
not to the person next to you. And listen, I'm,

460
00:34:07.225 --> 00:34:08.625
I don't want to, I don't want you to hear that.

461
00:34:08.645 --> 00:34:13.025
I'm saying it like just condemning and trying to come down hard because what I

462
00:34:13.025 --> 00:34:14.545
have seen, praise God,

463
00:34:14.545 --> 00:34:17.745
is that it seems like every week we get together like this,

464
00:34:18.295 --> 00:34:22.065
it's like our voices are getting a little bit louder and a little bit louder and

465
00:34:22.105 --> 00:34:26.585
a little bit louder. Like God is working and making us and shaping us.

466
00:34:27.925 --> 00:34:31.785
And it's, it's good news because here's what happens when those days come.

467
00:34:32.925 --> 00:34:36.375
When you walk in here or I walk in here and I'm looking around at the world and

468
00:34:36.395 --> 00:34:37.228
I'm saying, God, I,

469
00:34:37.365 --> 00:34:40.855
it's hard for me to remember that you are who you say you are or you've done

470
00:34:40.855 --> 00:34:44.655
what you've done. And I hear you singing those things to me,

471
00:34:45.525 --> 00:34:48.955
over me. It lifts my heart,

472
00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:54.095
it lifts my arms a little bit. And I pray it does that for you.

473
00:34:55.945 --> 00:34:59.485
Notice this is again, group singing.

474
00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:01.725
You're admonishing one another.

475
00:35:01.725 --> 00:35:06.685
You're singing in a sense over one another to God because

476
00:35:06.755 --> 00:35:08.445
it's in your heart.

477
00:35:11.765 --> 00:35:16.535
So here's what I hope you've seen today. Church, this new creation,

478
00:35:16.535 --> 00:35:20.695
kingdom of God is a whole different way of, of living.

479
00:35:22.435 --> 00:35:25.095
It is radically different.

480
00:35:25.095 --> 00:35:28.415
And that's what verse 17 summarizes. Look again.

481
00:35:30.345 --> 00:35:33.965
He said all this, all this, all this, all this. And whatever you do

482
00:35:35.865 --> 00:35:39.165
in word or deeded in voice or action,

483
00:35:39.705 --> 00:35:42.045
do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,

484
00:35:42.065 --> 00:35:45.965
giving thanks to God the Father through him

485
00:35:47.355 --> 00:35:52.125
this new self we're talking about, it should affect everything,

486
00:35:54.735 --> 00:35:57.885
every corner of your heart. Everything you're thinking about right now is God.

487
00:35:57.885 --> 00:35:59.365
Lord over that. Yes he is.

488
00:36:01.175 --> 00:36:04.235
Should I do that or should I not do that? Can you do it in the name of Jesus?

489
00:36:04.575 --> 00:36:07.235
That's his everything.

490
00:36:09.165 --> 00:36:12.495
Because Christ the king is your identity. Now

491
00:36:14.725 --> 00:36:16.935
He's given you a new identity. He's changed everything.

492
00:36:17.435 --> 00:36:20.295
And it's like you're walking around. I've got this jersey up here.

493
00:36:20.295 --> 00:36:23.415
This is my youngest son's fourth grade football jersey. Like,

494
00:36:23.725 --> 00:36:26.535
it's like you're walking around with the team jersey on,

495
00:36:26.755 --> 00:36:30.015
and the front of it is way more important than what's on the back, right?

496
00:36:30.795 --> 00:36:32.585
Every team you've ever been on or every scene,

497
00:36:32.695 --> 00:36:34.665
they are playing for the name on the front.

498
00:36:36.675 --> 00:36:41.575
And so you're walking around with the jersey on to reflect and point

499
00:36:41.635 --> 00:36:44.415
to the name on the front. But here's the reality.

500
00:36:46.145 --> 00:36:47.005
The name on the back,

501
00:36:48.215 --> 00:36:51.755
the reputation of the name on the back does affect how the front's viewed,

502
00:36:51.755 --> 00:36:52.588
right?

503
00:36:55.345 --> 00:37:00.325
And so we need to put on the new self such that the

504
00:37:00.335 --> 00:37:03.965
front name, the name of the Lord Jesus, as he says here,

505
00:37:04.025 --> 00:37:07.165
do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus. These your identity now.

506
00:37:07.265 --> 00:37:08.525
And you go for him.

507
00:37:08.525 --> 00:37:12.765
You're living a life on the backside that reflects this change he's made in you.

508
00:37:13.025 --> 00:37:14.405
He gets more glory from that.

509
00:37:17.275 --> 00:37:21.375
That's why this new self affects everything in our lives.

510
00:37:21.375 --> 00:37:26.215
Because people need to see that this is what God does. And listen,

511
00:37:26.325 --> 00:37:30.815
that means every word, every action, every thought. It is his,

512
00:37:30.955 --> 00:37:32.975
his transformation is comprehensive

513
00:37:35.125 --> 00:37:36.015
because remember,

514
00:37:36.015 --> 00:37:40.635
his goal is to shape you into the image of Christ

515
00:37:42.825 --> 00:37:44.815
whose perfect words, thoughts, actions,

516
00:37:44.815 --> 00:37:48.655
everything gave us what the image of God looks like.

517
00:37:51.715 --> 00:37:55.205
That would've stood out radically in Colossae,

518
00:37:56.485 --> 00:37:59.805
a life like that dark, sinful place.

519
00:37:59.805 --> 00:38:02.485
That was like radical difference.

520
00:38:05.525 --> 00:38:06.358
What about today?

521
00:38:08.575 --> 00:38:13.195
That's the same radical difference God's calling us to today

522
00:38:13.615 --> 00:38:17.355
and listen, empowering us to today. He's the,

523
00:38:17.425 --> 00:38:22.115
he's using us as the canvas. He's showing himself off. He's painting his love,

524
00:38:22.215 --> 00:38:25.115
his forgiveness, his peace, his joy, his life.

525
00:38:25.185 --> 00:38:29.955
He's painting it on our lives so that he shows off who

526
00:38:29.975 --> 00:38:30.808
he is.

527
00:38:34.365 --> 00:38:35.515
How are you doing at that church?

528
00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:40.785
How are we doing collectively?

529
00:38:41.645 --> 00:38:46.505
How are you doing individually at letting him

530
00:38:46.595 --> 00:38:48.305
shape you into this new image?

531
00:38:52.595 --> 00:38:57.175
Don't forget, remember if you've placed your faith in Jesus,

532
00:38:57.915 --> 00:39:02.335
he already has made you new. So live it out

533
00:39:03.915 --> 00:39:06.295
in the power of the spirit inside of you. Live it out

534
00:39:08.075 --> 00:39:09.815
all for his glory.
