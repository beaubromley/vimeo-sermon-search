00:00:01.205 --> 00:00:03.745
So numbers chapter 20 shows us that it had,

2
00:00:03.805 --> 00:00:05.185
it had been 40 years

3
00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:10.985
since the dramatic incident at Adeem where God ordered Moses

4
00:00:11.165 --> 00:00:13.345
to strike the rock, providing water

5
00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:15.705
for the parched Israelites.

6
00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.315
And yet here again, Moses faced a thirsty people.

7
00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:28.465
Bitter accusations were hurled at Moses, things like,

8
00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.825
if only we had died when our brothers fell

9
00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:31.865
dead before the Lord.

10
00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:36.145
Why did you bring the Lord's people into the desert that we

11
00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:39.025
and our livestocks should die here?

12
00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:45.795
Distraught. Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before God.

13
00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:49.045
And God gave them these instructions.

14
00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:53.805
He said, gather the people together, speak to that rock

15
00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:55.925
and it will pour out its water.

16
00:00:57.225 --> 00:00:59.795
So Moses gathered all the people,

17
00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:06.815
called them out in anger, and then he raised his arm

18
00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:10.455
and he struck the rock twice with his staff

19
00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:12.415
and water gushed out.

20
00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:16.165
And the people in their livestock drank

21
00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:19.175
another stunning miracle.

22
00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:25.295
God had done this, that that clear artesian water

23
00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:28.015
flowed out of a rock.

24
00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:31.215
And every one of the million plus people in their

25
00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:32.575
animals drank their fill.

26
00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:36.055
What a huge success, right?

27
00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:40.165
I mean, you can imagine Moses and Aaron high fiving

28
00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:43.685
and hugging and, and no doubt embracing one another

29
00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:45.285
with this reality of,

30
00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:49.485
of a thunderous roar rolling across the wilderness

31
00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:51.805
as the people celebrated.

32
00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:55.885
Moses was again, a hero.

33
00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:01.365
Through him, God had met the needs of his people.

34
00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:04.085
Israel was miraculously preserved

35
00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:07.525
and they gave glory to where it belonged to God.

36
00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:13.295
It seemed to be another resounding success in Moses' life.

37
00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:19.645
But that was Earth's point of view.

38
00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:27.235
From Heaven's perspective, Moses had sadly failed.

39
00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:35.135
See, in his fury, Moses had disregarded God's direction

40
00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:36.855
to speak to the rock,

41
00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:40.875
and instead had taken his staff and struck it twice.

42
00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:46.985
And his tragic failure was of such proportion

43
00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:52.105
that he would not fulfill his life's cherished dream

44
00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:54.265
of leading Israel into the Promised land.

45
00:02:57.995 --> 00:02:59.135
God said to him this,

46
00:03:00.035 --> 00:03:03.045
because you did not trust in me enough to honor me

47
00:03:03.045 --> 00:03:05.645
as holy in the sight of the Israelites.

48
00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:08.245
You will not bring this community into the

49
00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:09.325
land that I've given them.

50
00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:14.855
What a sad ending to a great story.

51
00:03:17.445 --> 00:03:18.865
But what does that have to do with us today?

52
00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:22.305
Like what in the world does that matter for us?

53
00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:25.265
Well, Kent Hughes said it this way.

54
00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.385
It means that one can be regarded

55
00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:32.185
as hugely successful in ministry and yet be a failure.

56
00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:39.165
It's possible to give people exactly what they need,

57
00:03:40.425 --> 00:03:42.445
the practical exposition of God's word.

58
00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:46.325
Inspiring worship programs that meet the needs

59
00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:50.765
of people wonderfully and yet still be a failure.

60
00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:57.195
It's possibly be held up as a model of success

61
00:03:57.375 --> 00:04:00.115
and receive the passionate accolades of one's people

62
00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.595
and yet be a failure.

63
00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:11.405
The reason Moses so miserably failed was

64
00:04:11.405 --> 00:04:13.325
that he was not faithful to God's word.

65
00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.025
It's what one Corinthians four, two says.

66
00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:22.345
It is required of stewards that they be found faithful.

67
00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:27.895
See, that's the heart of what God's word's gonna teach us

68
00:04:27.905 --> 00:04:32.625
today, both primarily

69
00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:34.985
for leaders in the church,

70
00:04:36.895 --> 00:04:38.795
but I believe this is applicable to every one of us

71
00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:40.715
as we go through our lives.

72
00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:43.155
And so turn there with me now to one Corinthians.

73
00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:47.465
Chapter four will be verses one through five.

74
00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:51.425
Today, one Corinthians four, one through five.

75
00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:55.985
Similar to last week, Paul was referring to his

76
00:04:56.085 --> 00:04:58.425
and other main leader's position.

77
00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:03.705
Yet he was applying it beyond him

78
00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.745
to other church leaders that would follow him.

79
00:05:05.845 --> 00:05:09.025
He was saying, here's the way he should see

80
00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:11.465
and the way we should see ourselves.

81
00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:13.905
One Corinthians four verses

82
00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:15.105
one through five, let me read it.

83
00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:22.405
This is how one should regard us as servants of Christ

84
00:05:22.585 --> 00:05:24.445
and stewards of the mysteries of God.

85
00:05:25.465 --> 00:05:27.465
Moreover, it's required of stewards

86
00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:28.665
that they be found faithful.

87
00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:32.765
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged

88
00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:34.685
by you or by any human court.

89
00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:39.555
In fact, I do not even judge myself for I'm not aware

90
00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:43.475
of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted.

91
00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:46.095
It is the Lord who judges me.

92
00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:50.175
Therefore, do not pronounce judgment before the time

93
00:05:50.355 --> 00:05:53.375
before the Lord comes who will bring

94
00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:55.655
to light the things now hidden in darkness

95
00:05:56.115 --> 00:05:58.525
and will disclose the purposes of the heart.

96
00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:03.595
Then each one will receive his commendation from God.

97
00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:07.195
Lord, this is your word.

98
00:06:08.615 --> 00:06:10.925
We're thankful that you gave it to us

99
00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:15.845
And You've given it to us today for a reason.

100
00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:20.165
And God, I pray you give us hearts to receive,

101
00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:24.325
to be good soil for this word to plant in us,

102
00:06:25.105 --> 00:06:27.045
to bear good fruit in our lives.

103
00:06:27.435 --> 00:06:30.205
That we would be doers of the word, not hearers only,

104
00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:32.125
and that we would have ears to hear

105
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.645
what you have to say to us today.

106
00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:38.845
Humble us, God, before your mighty hand.

107
00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:46.425
Lead us to repentance as we need it

108
00:06:49.155 --> 00:06:50.935
and lead us in the way of our lasting today.

109
00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:54.915
God, for your glory. In Jesus' name.

110
00:06:55.705 --> 00:06:59.805
Amen. And so again,

111
00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:02.845
Paul was primarily talking about church leaders here.

112
00:07:03.545 --> 00:07:05.085
And that's the angle that he's saying.

113
00:07:05.085 --> 00:07:06.565
And we're gonna take a primary angle there,

114
00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:10.725
but remember that in a way we're all leading someone in some

115
00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:12.995
way, whether that's at work

116
00:07:13.055 --> 00:07:16.645
or at home, maybe CG leaders,

117
00:07:16.985 --> 00:07:19.725
elders within the church, authors that you're reading,

118
00:07:20.075 --> 00:07:22.845
blog writers, social media, influencers.

119
00:07:24.515 --> 00:07:26.565
Like there's a measure of of watching

120
00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:30.575
and seeing how we should see them as well as

121
00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:31.695
how they should see themselves.

122
00:07:31.695 --> 00:07:35.935
And so throughout today, consider also how this applies

123
00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.095
to every one of us in some form as we go,

124
00:07:39.115 --> 00:07:42.135
but primarily it is to church leaders.

125
00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:43.615
So first, here's the question,

126
00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:46.015
what's a leader's correct posture?

127
00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:49.535
What is a leader's correct posture?

128
00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:52.975
Well, a chiropractor says upright,

129
00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:54.495
shoulders back, kind of head.

130
00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:55.855
Wait, no, not that posture.

131
00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:58.255
Okay, although that is good,

132
00:07:58.315 --> 00:08:00.455
but not what we're talking about here today.

133
00:08:00.835 --> 00:08:05.015
How they see themselves, how others

134
00:08:05.595 --> 00:08:07.175
see them as well.

135
00:08:07.315 --> 00:08:09.815
That's this posture. And verse one is very clear.

136
00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:13.695
He says, leaders should have the posture of servants.

137
00:08:15.545 --> 00:08:18.005
Leader should have the posture of servants.

138
00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:19.805
This is how someone should regard us,

139
00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:21.525
how someone should think about us.

140
00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:25.885
It's as servants of Christ, the Messiah.

141
00:08:29.345 --> 00:08:31.805
Now, this actually is not the typical word for servant.

142
00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:35.685
He uses in other writings, other places.

143
00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:37.805
He uses the word that we get deacon from

144
00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:39.445
and that's how he uses the word servant.

145
00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:42.445
But, but here he's using a word for like a helper

146
00:08:42.825 --> 00:08:44.205
or a, a task runner.

147
00:08:45.715 --> 00:08:48.365
It's really a no name who is an assistant

148
00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:49.845
to someone in an official position.

149
00:08:51.235 --> 00:08:54.035
I was a page at the state capitol in high school.

150
00:08:54.425 --> 00:08:57.005
Like nobody knew. It didn't, it didn't matter who I was.

151
00:08:57.025 --> 00:08:59.165
It was that I have a task and you go do this

152
00:08:59.275 --> 00:09:02.685
because you're serving someone in an official capacity.

153
00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:06.165
That means in this word the way he uses it, there's a,

154
00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:08.885
an a humility inherent to the position.

155
00:09:10.145 --> 00:09:12.435
There's something that you, you,

156
00:09:12.435 --> 00:09:15.755
you're just simply following orders, just doing your job.

157
00:09:17.135 --> 00:09:19.115
You're a servant in that way,

158
00:09:20.485 --> 00:09:22.715
which dovetails nicely with the second posture.

159
00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:27.465
He says that of stewards of the message, servants

160
00:09:27.465 --> 00:09:29.865
of the Christ, stewards of the message.

161
00:09:30.365 --> 00:09:33.745
Now we don't use the word steward very often in our day,

162
00:09:34.805 --> 00:09:38.585
but a steward was a household servant, often a slave,

163
00:09:39.805 --> 00:09:40.945
yet was given a measure

164
00:09:41.005 --> 00:09:44.505
of authority over the other household servants.

165
00:09:45.815 --> 00:09:48.585
They're often referred to as overseers.

166
00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:53.575
That's why we know Paul was primarily referring

167
00:09:53.575 --> 00:09:55.095
to church leaders here

168
00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:58.015
because that's one of his favorite designations

169
00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:00.095
for pastors and elders.

170
00:10:00.995 --> 00:10:04.735
In fact, in Titus one seven, he calls overseers

171
00:10:04.735 --> 00:10:06.455
of the church stewards.

172
00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:10.605
So this is the idea he's getting to here.

173
00:10:12.075 --> 00:10:16.245
There's a stewardship in leadership, but stewards of what?

174
00:10:16.245 --> 00:10:18.565
Stewardship of what is he talking about here?

175
00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:21.205
He says the mysteries of God.

176
00:10:22.775 --> 00:10:24.435
Now, does that mean we'll never know anything about

177
00:10:24.535 --> 00:10:25.715
God because it's all mysterious?

178
00:10:25.735 --> 00:10:28.635
No. What he's I I rephrased it to say the message.

179
00:10:30.385 --> 00:10:32.995
What message? The message about God.

180
00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:37.315
Back then it was the apostles who were called

181
00:10:37.495 --> 00:10:41.755
to steward the testimony of Christ's life, death,

182
00:10:41.755 --> 00:10:45.275
and resurrection to ensure that it was, it was going out

183
00:10:45.795 --> 00:10:48.195
accurately to the world as it spread.

184
00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:50.075
They were the ones who were checking

185
00:10:50.135 --> 00:10:51.595
and making sure that it was right.

186
00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:58.575
But after them, as the, the scriptures were written,

187
00:10:58.675 --> 00:10:59.975
as things began to grow,

188
00:11:00.115 --> 00:11:02.095
it was then the whole council of God.

189
00:11:02.235 --> 00:11:04.575
It was all the mysteries of the kingdom

190
00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:08.335
that God was revealing through his word

191
00:11:09.845 --> 00:11:13.335
that church leaders, apostles and beyond are to steward

192
00:11:13.995 --> 00:11:16.335
and preserve all of that in a way,

193
00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:19.655
yet also employ it for multiplication.

194
00:11:21.485 --> 00:11:22.765
'cause that's what a steward does, right?

195
00:11:24.115 --> 00:11:26.795
A steward was given authority in a way over the

196
00:11:26.995 --> 00:11:28.395
master's resources.

197
00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:30.635
By the way, remember it's not the steward's resources.

198
00:11:30.735 --> 00:11:33.795
You don't own anything. It's the master's resources.

199
00:11:33.795 --> 00:11:37.355
The steward is to use for the benefit of the master

200
00:11:37.815 --> 00:11:39.555
and the benefit of the rest of the household.

201
00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:43.235
They were to invest and serve

202
00:11:43.255 --> 00:11:46.555
and work so that the, the household flourished

203
00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:49.555
through the use of the resources.

204
00:11:51.925 --> 00:11:53.765
Do you see the dignity in that? Right?

205
00:11:53.825 --> 00:11:57.045
So we think slave stu servant in this context steward,

206
00:11:57.795 --> 00:11:58.925
it's a lesser position.

207
00:11:58.925 --> 00:12:00.405
There's a dignity to this.

208
00:12:01.835 --> 00:12:04.805
When Paul says we are stewards of the mysteries,

209
00:12:04.805 --> 00:12:08.085
there's a massive level of dignity.

210
00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:13.475
So when you apply this to church leaders, then

211
00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:19.045
the servant of Christ, steward of the gospel, the message

212
00:12:19.945 --> 00:12:21.765
it brings with it an appropriate level

213
00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.525
of authority within the church,

214
00:12:23.585 --> 00:12:25.485
but at the same time an appropriate level

215
00:12:25.485 --> 00:12:27.565
of humility of service.

216
00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:32.045
Say I'm here for you household, right?

217
00:12:32.105 --> 00:12:34.565
Uh, as a steward, they would be there

218
00:12:34.705 --> 00:12:36.325
for the benefit of everyone else.

219
00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:38.845
That's what a steward does.

220
00:12:41.805 --> 00:12:43.345
All that though brings up the next question.

221
00:12:44.425 --> 00:12:45.955
What is the leader's correct goal?

222
00:12:46.815 --> 00:12:49.155
That's the correct posture, both the way yours

223
00:12:49.155 --> 00:12:52.515
to see leaders and the way leaders are to see themselves.

224
00:12:53.055 --> 00:12:55.315
But what's the goal for a leader?

225
00:12:56.755 --> 00:12:58.045
Well look at verse two again.

226
00:12:58.045 --> 00:13:01.525
He says, it is required of stewards, not optional.

227
00:13:02.675 --> 00:13:04.845
This isn't something that you can choose to do or not.

228
00:13:04.865 --> 00:13:09.285
It is required of stewards that they be found faithful.

229
00:13:12.965 --> 00:13:17.565
Now as we go into this, this section here,

230
00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:22.215
this will actually push on the modern church

231
00:13:22.515 --> 00:13:23.935
us a little bit.

232
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.575
It's gonna step on our toes a little bit.

233
00:13:30.765 --> 00:13:34.335
Because the reality is that even though we might say

234
00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:39.145
otherwise, the prevailing measure in

235
00:13:39.165 --> 00:13:42.705
our day of when a church is doing well

236
00:13:44.085 --> 00:13:48.335
or when a church is struggling is based on numbers.

237
00:13:50.735 --> 00:13:55.595
The prevailing measurement in our current modern church

238
00:13:55.595 --> 00:14:00.205
culture of success is numbers.

239
00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:02.525
Now we may nuance that a little bit here and there.

240
00:14:02.545 --> 00:14:04.525
We try to make it seem like that's not true.

241
00:14:04.555 --> 00:14:06.325
What we're really basing it on is, but,

242
00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:07.765
but let me just tell you my own heart.

243
00:14:08.885 --> 00:14:12.045
I know, I know where I have been and am at times

244
00:14:12.345 --> 00:14:15.085
and I can so easily fall into the trap

245
00:14:16.885 --> 00:14:20.875
that when attendance is up, budget's up,

246
00:14:21.955 --> 00:14:23.395
whatever trends up, man,

247
00:14:23.435 --> 00:14:25.075
I can start feeling pretty good about myself.

248
00:14:25.835 --> 00:14:27.955
I can start feeling pretty good about the church,

249
00:14:30.735 --> 00:14:34.185
but when the numbers are lower, I can

250
00:14:34.185 --> 00:14:35.385
so easily feel like a failure.

251
00:14:39.785 --> 00:14:42.365
That's why all the way back in 1987, Kent

252
00:14:42.365 --> 00:14:45.205
and Barbara Hughes wrote a great book called Liberating

253
00:14:46.005 --> 00:14:48.045
Ministry from the Success Syndrome.

254
00:14:51.105 --> 00:14:54.145
I had it on my shelf literally for probably 15 years.

255
00:14:55.485 --> 00:14:57.065
And just in the last few months,

256
00:14:57.325 --> 00:14:58.545
God brought it back to mind.

257
00:14:59.955 --> 00:15:01.815
And it is powerful

258
00:15:02.365 --> 00:15:06.695
because in it, Kent, who was a pastor for 40 some years,

259
00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:09.215
he especially wrestles with this pressure.

260
00:15:09.215 --> 00:15:13.575
He felt as a pastor that if things were not growing

261
00:15:14.155 --> 00:15:17.955
it was his fault and he was a failure.

262
00:15:18.775 --> 00:15:20.835
He felt like he wasn't successful,

263
00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:23.555
he wasn't succeeding in the ministry.

264
00:15:26.555 --> 00:15:31.415
But is that true? No.

265
00:15:32.435 --> 00:15:36.135
And Paul's very clear here in chapter four

266
00:15:36.965 --> 00:15:40.175
that the goal of a leader is not success.

267
00:15:43.725 --> 00:15:46.375
Like success is not the goal. Paul says.

268
00:15:48.965 --> 00:15:51.105
Now, we'll talk about later. Who judges that anyway?

269
00:15:51.235 --> 00:15:52.505
We'll, we'll see that, but,

270
00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:58.065
but quote unquote, success cannot be what we shoot for.

271
00:16:00.515 --> 00:16:03.685
That can't be our main measure of worth in ministry

272
00:16:03.785 --> 00:16:05.085
or in life at all.

273
00:16:08.745 --> 00:16:12.125
Now, the thing that's required of stewards, the thing

274
00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:15.925
that our master desires is faithfulness.

275
00:16:19.265 --> 00:16:21.915
Like even high school seniors, as you guys go out to

276
00:16:22.495 --> 00:16:23.995
the next phase of life,

277
00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:26.555
the whole world tells you be successful.

278
00:16:27.775 --> 00:16:30.865
Okay, well I think in a right frame we can keep that, but,

279
00:16:31.245 --> 00:16:32.425
but this is the main point.

280
00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:35.755
To be faithful.

281
00:16:37.975 --> 00:16:41.475
That's the gold. The word faithful means true,

282
00:16:41.905 --> 00:16:44.115
trustworthy, reliable.

283
00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:47.835
Are you faithful?

284
00:16:47.835 --> 00:16:50.995
It doesn't matter how much you have or what place you have

285
00:16:51.055 --> 00:16:52.355
or position you have.

286
00:16:52.535 --> 00:16:57.035
Are you faithful with what God has entrusted to you?

287
00:16:57.035 --> 00:17:00.115
That's why I love the parable of the talents

288
00:17:00.115 --> 00:17:02.075
that Jesus gave in Matthew 25.

289
00:17:03.595 --> 00:17:04.845
Just listen to how this goes.

290
00:17:04.845 --> 00:17:07.525
Paint the picture in your head as I read it.

291
00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:12.475
Jesus says, it will be like a man going on a journey

292
00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:16.915
who called his servants, the bond servants, maybe stewards

293
00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:20.355
and entrusted to them his property to one,

294
00:17:20.355 --> 00:17:22.155
he gave five talents.

295
00:17:22.155 --> 00:17:25.515
That's a measure of money. Five talents to another.

296
00:17:25.735 --> 00:17:27.195
He gave two to another.

297
00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:30.115
He gave one to each according to his ability.

298
00:17:30.695 --> 00:17:32.885
And then he went away. He

299
00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.605
who had received the five talents went at

300
00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:35.685
once and traded with them.

301
00:17:35.685 --> 00:17:37.485
And he made five talents more.

302
00:17:38.465 --> 00:17:41.365
So also, he who had the two talents made two talents more.

303
00:17:43.225 --> 00:17:45.205
But he who had received the one talent went

304
00:17:45.205 --> 00:17:47.565
and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.

305
00:17:49.285 --> 00:17:51.625
Now, after a long time, the master of those servants came

306
00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:52.905
and settled accounts with them.

307
00:17:53.645 --> 00:17:55.505
And he who had received the five talents came

308
00:17:55.505 --> 00:17:56.865
forward bringing five talents.

309
00:17:56.865 --> 00:17:58.865
More saying, master, you delivered

310
00:17:58.865 --> 00:18:01.225
to me five talents here I made five talents more.

311
00:18:01.225 --> 00:18:04.905
And his master said to him, well done, good

312
00:18:04.965 --> 00:18:06.905
and faithful servant.

313
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:09.985
You've been faithful over a little.

314
00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:13.745
I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.

315
00:18:15.585 --> 00:18:18.565
And he also who had the two talents came forward saying,

316
00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:20.405
master, you delivered me two talents here.

317
00:18:20.485 --> 00:18:21.485
I made two talents more.

318
00:18:22.145 --> 00:18:23.605
His master said to him, well done,

319
00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:24.885
good and faithful servant.

320
00:18:25.465 --> 00:18:26.765
You've been faithful over a little.

321
00:18:27.035 --> 00:18:30.085
I'll set you over much enter into the joy of your master.

322
00:18:33.255 --> 00:18:35.835
But he also who had received the one talent came forward

323
00:18:35.855 --> 00:18:39.075
saying, master, I knew you to be a hard man reaping

324
00:18:39.075 --> 00:18:41.995
where you did not sow gathering where you scattered no seed.

325
00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.545
So I was afraid and I went

326
00:18:45.545 --> 00:18:47.025
and hid your talent in the ground.

327
00:18:48.625 --> 00:18:50.555
Here you have what is yours?

328
00:18:52.055 --> 00:18:54.825
Meaning he gave him the one talent back,

329
00:18:54.885 --> 00:18:58.345
but his master answered him you wicked and slothful servant.

330
00:18:59.045 --> 00:19:01.145
You knew that I reap where I have not sown you gather

331
00:19:01.145 --> 00:19:02.425
where I scattered no seed.

332
00:19:02.655 --> 00:19:05.385
Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers.

333
00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:07.945
And at my coming, I should have received

334
00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:10.785
what was my own with interest.

335
00:19:14.585 --> 00:19:17.165
And his end is not pretty.

336
00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.005
But I want us to notice a few things about this parable.

337
00:19:24.175 --> 00:19:27.965
First, the master wanted the stewards to do something with

338
00:19:27.965 --> 00:19:29.165
what he'd given them, right?

339
00:19:30.475 --> 00:19:33.175
He entrusted them to do something with it.

340
00:19:36.865 --> 00:19:40.245
But also notice it didn't matter

341
00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:41.805
how much they had been given

342
00:19:44.555 --> 00:19:48.455
or that the amount produced on the back end was equal

343
00:19:48.485 --> 00:19:49.895
amongst the three.

344
00:19:53.495 --> 00:19:55.095
'cause notice the servant who'd been given five,

345
00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:56.335
he handed back 10.

346
00:19:57.915 --> 00:19:59.095
So the masters got 10.

347
00:20:00.235 --> 00:20:01.575
But then the servant who had been given

348
00:20:01.795 --> 00:20:03.375
two handed the master.

349
00:20:03.645 --> 00:20:08.145
Four. Now, okay, a hundred percent, we love that.

350
00:20:08.205 --> 00:20:10.905
But but notice the, the end result, the harvest,

351
00:20:11.125 --> 00:20:13.225
you might say was different,

352
00:20:14.705 --> 00:20:16.925
but what was the master's response to both

353
00:20:18.975 --> 00:20:20.585
exactly the same, right?

354
00:20:21.725 --> 00:20:26.265
He says, well done, good and faithful servant.

355
00:20:28.085 --> 00:20:30.865
You have been faithful over a little.

356
00:20:31.865 --> 00:20:36.025
I will set you over much enter into the joy of your master.

357
00:20:38.155 --> 00:20:39.855
Now, I've always wondered, what about the one,

358
00:20:39.925 --> 00:20:41.535
what about the guy who had the one?

359
00:20:43.585 --> 00:20:46.835
Well, I believe we can safely assume that if that man

360
00:20:46.855 --> 00:20:48.085
or woman, whoever it was,

361
00:20:48.085 --> 00:20:50.725
would have taken the one talent gone

362
00:20:50.725 --> 00:20:53.325
and done the same thing that the other two had done

363
00:20:53.465 --> 00:20:55.965
and invested it and brought back two to the master,

364
00:20:56.315 --> 00:20:57.485
what do you think he would've heard?

365
00:20:59.735 --> 00:21:01.585
Well done. Good and faithful servant.

366
00:21:02.335 --> 00:21:03.625
Been faithful over a little.

367
00:21:03.685 --> 00:21:07.065
You've said over much enter the joy, right? The same thing.

368
00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:09.675
It didn't matter what they had started with

369
00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:11.875
or what they even amount brought back,

370
00:21:12.055 --> 00:21:14.275
it was they were faithful, right?

371
00:21:17.285 --> 00:21:21.065
And Chris Austin said this faithfulness in little things

372
00:21:21.685 --> 00:21:22.745
is a big thing.

373
00:21:27.005 --> 00:21:30.385
And so again, the point here is that the goal of ministry,

374
00:21:30.445 --> 00:21:33.505
the goal of life is not success.

375
00:21:37.165 --> 00:21:38.855
It's not more, it's not bigger.

376
00:21:40.695 --> 00:21:42.835
The goal is faithfulness.

377
00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:48.195
And the context of Matthew 25 is in the Jesus dialogue

378
00:21:48.195 --> 00:21:49.795
of saying about the end times.

379
00:21:51.255 --> 00:21:53.465
He's saying that masters coming back pretty soon.

380
00:21:53.765 --> 00:21:56.105
How are you going to handle what he's given you now

381
00:21:56.835 --> 00:22:00.645
until he comes that master's returning soon?

382
00:22:00.705 --> 00:22:02.165
Are we faithful?

383
00:22:05.955 --> 00:22:08.005
Okay, great. We would all agree.

384
00:22:08.025 --> 00:22:12.755
We need to be faithful according to what standard though,

385
00:22:15.325 --> 00:22:18.615
according to what standard, who's the judge

386
00:22:19.635 --> 00:22:21.095
of whether we are faithful or not?

387
00:22:22.035 --> 00:22:25.525
Because that's the question we have is, is all right.

388
00:22:25.525 --> 00:22:28.405
Faithfulness is what we look for. But who's the judge?

389
00:22:28.405 --> 00:22:30.485
And I've, I've already heard it this morning once I,

390
00:22:30.525 --> 00:22:31.645
I think we inherently know the answer.

391
00:22:31.715 --> 00:22:33.485
This kids, this was your Sunday school answer.

392
00:22:33.655 --> 00:22:36.885
Who's the judge of this? Jesus? Yeah, we got that right.

393
00:22:36.915 --> 00:22:39.965
Okay, we got that. We know that inherently.

394
00:22:43.185 --> 00:22:45.485
But the interesting part of one Corinthians four,

395
00:22:45.675 --> 00:22:47.405
hope you notice this, is that it,

396
00:22:47.425 --> 00:22:49.205
it offers us some alternatives

397
00:22:50.845 --> 00:22:52.695
that I know I slip into at times.

398
00:22:54.885 --> 00:22:57.855
Like when the enemy tosses into my heart this question

399
00:22:57.855 --> 00:22:59.135
of whether I'm being faithful or not.

400
00:23:01.385 --> 00:23:03.645
And that scale begins to go back and forth.

401
00:23:03.705 --> 00:23:06.085
And I'm wondering and questioning whether I'm faithful

402
00:23:06.085 --> 00:23:10.125
or not, I can slip into these other alternatives

403
00:23:11.315 --> 00:23:12.565
that Paul offers here.

404
00:23:15.765 --> 00:23:18.465
The first one is in the first part of verse three here,

405
00:23:18.465 --> 00:23:20.185
first Corinthians four, verse three.

406
00:23:20.255 --> 00:23:21.985
Just the very first part he says,

407
00:23:22.445 --> 00:23:25.185
but with me, it is a very small thing

408
00:23:25.535 --> 00:23:29.185
that I should be judged by you or by any human court.

409
00:23:32.005 --> 00:23:34.945
And so the question he's asking here is whether others are

410
00:23:35.045 --> 00:23:37.425
an appropriate judge of faithfulness or not?

411
00:23:39.735 --> 00:23:44.675
Are others an appropriate level of faithful judge or not?

412
00:23:44.775 --> 00:23:47.605
Are the judgments of others sufficient

413
00:23:47.745 --> 00:23:51.005
to say whether someone is faithful or not?

414
00:23:51.005 --> 00:23:52.565
Because here's what was happening back then.

415
00:23:53.345 --> 00:23:56.005
Here's the context of what he's talking about.

416
00:23:56.495 --> 00:23:59.565
There were some were saying in Corinth, some were saying,

417
00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:00.845
Hey, Paul's better at this.

418
00:24:01.475 --> 00:24:04.725
Apollos is better at this, or he's worse at this,

419
00:24:04.945 --> 00:24:06.325
or he's being faithful here.

420
00:24:06.555 --> 00:24:07.565
He's wrong in this.

421
00:24:07.625 --> 00:24:10.205
And they were, they were judging all of these leaders

422
00:24:10.305 --> 00:24:12.685
and preachers and people that they had been listening to

423
00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:16.605
and on and on it goes that they were beginning to separate

424
00:24:16.665 --> 00:24:18.405
and divide over those things.

425
00:24:18.515 --> 00:24:23.125
Even judging Paul by their worldly standard in Corinth,

426
00:24:24.795 --> 00:24:27.625
which he actually talked about in chapter one, that he said,

427
00:24:27.785 --> 00:24:31.105
I did not come to Corinth with your spirit of debate

428
00:24:31.325 --> 00:24:33.745
and wisdom because I didn't, I I didn't want to.

429
00:24:33.975 --> 00:24:35.945
Knowing that you would trust that instead

430
00:24:35.945 --> 00:24:37.585
of trusting Christ in him crucified.

431
00:24:39.265 --> 00:24:41.525
So he knew he wasn't being judged

432
00:24:42.005 --> 00:24:43.325
accurately 'cause they were judging on that.

433
00:24:45.555 --> 00:24:47.535
And so here he says, I'm not worried about

434
00:24:47.535 --> 00:24:48.535
what people think about me.

435
00:24:49.315 --> 00:24:51.735
I'm not worried about whether I measure up

436
00:24:51.755 --> 00:24:53.295
to some worldly standard or not.

437
00:24:56.315 --> 00:24:59.215
In fact, if you would ask Paul, he says this in other parts

438
00:24:59.215 --> 00:25:03.495
of the scriptures, if you'd ask him, he'd be like, actually,

439
00:25:03.795 --> 00:25:05.375
I'm far worse than you think I am.

440
00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:10.275
You've said all this, boy, you didn't even get all of it.

441
00:25:14.675 --> 00:25:19.375
So other people cannot be an accurate judge of

442
00:25:19.375 --> 00:25:20.455
what faithfulness is.

443
00:25:23.815 --> 00:25:27.275
Now we need to listen to what other people say.

444
00:25:28.505 --> 00:25:31.085
Of course we do, because they might be right.

445
00:25:31.755 --> 00:25:35.925
They might be seeing something in my life that I'm blind to,

446
00:25:36.625 --> 00:25:38.925
so don't completely shut it off.

447
00:25:40.625 --> 00:25:43.485
But, but just because a bunch of people say something is

448
00:25:44.005 --> 00:25:45.805
faithful or

449
00:25:45.805 --> 00:25:48.365
because a bunch of people say something isn't faithful.

450
00:25:50.195 --> 00:25:53.365
Doesn't mean it necessarily is true either way.

451
00:25:58.155 --> 00:25:59.615
But here's what can happen as a result.

452
00:26:02.605 --> 00:26:04.305
And I know this is true because I've done this.

453
00:26:06.345 --> 00:26:09.685
We work so hard to shut off the noise from others.

454
00:26:11.895 --> 00:26:14.135
I don't care what you say, I'm not gonna listen to it.

455
00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:15.855
And we just stay in our own head.

456
00:26:15.855 --> 00:26:18.015
And what we end up doing is we become our own judge.

457
00:26:21.815 --> 00:26:23.915
No one else judges but me.

458
00:26:26.385 --> 00:26:28.405
But is that the right way to measure faithfulness?

459
00:26:28.405 --> 00:26:32.175
Either because look at

460
00:26:32.175 --> 00:26:33.535
how Paul continued here in verse three.

461
00:26:33.555 --> 00:26:37.175
He says, in fact, I do not even judge myself.

462
00:26:40.855 --> 00:26:42.585
Meaning I don't even sit back

463
00:26:42.765 --> 00:26:46.565
and say, well, all those people are wrong

464
00:26:47.155 --> 00:26:49.245
because I know what's really true about me.

465
00:26:49.815 --> 00:26:52.125
Right? They, you kinda shut everything off in a bubble.

466
00:26:52.185 --> 00:26:54.045
You just say, I'm not gonna listen to any of you.

467
00:26:54.285 --> 00:26:56.285
'cause I know what's true about myself

468
00:26:56.285 --> 00:26:58.405
and I have this bubble around me.

469
00:27:00.315 --> 00:27:03.635
Here's the problem. We can

470
00:27:03.695 --> 00:27:05.995
so quickly deceive ourselves, can't we?

471
00:27:11.275 --> 00:27:13.935
Anyone else ever been in denial of a problem

472
00:27:15.265 --> 00:27:17.285
in your own life, right?

473
00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:19.525
You just kind of like you're addicted to something.

474
00:27:19.525 --> 00:27:20.565
You're like, well, that's not that bad.

475
00:27:21.555 --> 00:27:22.845
It's not really that big of a problem.

476
00:27:23.005 --> 00:27:25.565
I can overcome any, right? Anybody else? Maybe just me.

477
00:27:25.645 --> 00:27:28.685
I saw two hands. Okay, great. Um,

478
00:27:33.965 --> 00:27:36.265
Listen, it can even happen for those of us in ministry

479
00:27:39.555 --> 00:27:42.585
where anyone on the other side of an issue

480
00:27:43.205 --> 00:27:46.725
or anyone who's critiquing

481
00:27:48.175 --> 00:27:49.635
is just automatically wrong.

482
00:27:52.385 --> 00:27:54.645
And that's not right. That's not a good attitude

483
00:27:56.075 --> 00:27:59.325
because we tend to overestimate our own faithfulness.

484
00:28:01.265 --> 00:28:03.605
We tend to judge highly ourselves

485
00:28:04.545 --> 00:28:06.245
and judge harshly other people.

486
00:28:11.045 --> 00:28:12.745
But look at what Paul says in verse four.

487
00:28:13.845 --> 00:28:18.335
He says, yeah, I don't even judge myself for, I'm not aware

488
00:28:18.335 --> 00:28:19.615
of anything against myself.

489
00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:23.095
Meaning as far as I can tell, I haven't done anything.

490
00:28:24.505 --> 00:28:28.005
But I am not thereby acquitted.

491
00:28:30.985 --> 00:28:33.595
It is the Lord who judges me.

492
00:28:33.615 --> 00:28:36.515
But, but notice he said that I'm not aware,

493
00:28:37.455 --> 00:28:39.975
but I'm not acquitted

494
00:28:39.975 --> 00:28:41.815
because there might be something in me

495
00:28:41.815 --> 00:28:45.995
that I didn't even know I was doing at the time or,

496
00:28:46.175 --> 00:28:48.715
or there's something deep inside me that,

497
00:28:48.715 --> 00:28:51.475
that I assumed my motives were pure in doing this.

498
00:28:51.475 --> 00:28:56.435
But it really wasn't. Paul's

499
00:28:56.435 --> 00:28:58.635
basically saying, I know I'm not perfect.

500
00:29:01.845 --> 00:29:04.785
How does he know that? Because like I read the last phrase,

501
00:29:04.965 --> 00:29:07.545
it is the Lord who judges me.

502
00:29:09.775 --> 00:29:12.915
See, Paul knew there was still something in him

503
00:29:12.915 --> 00:29:17.395
because his true standard of faithfulness was a holy God.

504
00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:23.405
We can't always trust other people's judgments.

505
00:29:23.865 --> 00:29:26.365
We can't even trust our own judgments

506
00:29:26.365 --> 00:29:28.085
because we might self deceive.

507
00:29:28.265 --> 00:29:32.125
That's why our true standard of faithfulness must be God.

508
00:29:32.505 --> 00:29:36.005
The right standard is the judge.

509
00:29:38.065 --> 00:29:39.315
Nothing, no one.

510
00:29:39.575 --> 00:29:41.845
The right standard is, is him

511
00:29:45.625 --> 00:29:47.445
for, I'm not aware of anything against myself,

512
00:29:47.465 --> 00:29:49.125
but I am not thereby acquitted.

513
00:29:49.125 --> 00:29:50.925
It is the Lord who judges me.

514
00:29:51.155 --> 00:29:54.285
Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time

515
00:29:54.465 --> 00:29:56.685
before the Lord comes who will bring

516
00:29:56.685 --> 00:29:58.605
to light the things now hidden in darkness

517
00:29:58.865 --> 00:30:01.285
and will disclose the purposes of the heart.

518
00:30:02.115 --> 00:30:05.125
Each one will receive his commendation from God.

519
00:30:08.085 --> 00:30:10.545
May we see this exposure happen almost every day,

520
00:30:10.935 --> 00:30:12.265
even in our time.

521
00:30:12.435 --> 00:30:16.925
Don't we, a pastor

522
00:30:17.105 --> 00:30:19.125
or a church might look like a success,

523
00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:25.375
but it all crumbles when the unfaithfulness that's been

524
00:30:25.375 --> 00:30:27.335
behind the curtain finally gets exposed

525
00:30:31.025 --> 00:30:32.765
and it's so destructive to a church.

526
00:30:32.795 --> 00:30:33.965
It's so destructive to the kingdom.

527
00:30:34.025 --> 00:30:38.645
That's why a, a primary goal must be faithfulness

528
00:30:38.785 --> 00:30:39.805
to God first.

529
00:30:42.985 --> 00:30:45.315
Like we can't focus on numbers or growth

530
00:30:45.815 --> 00:30:48.235
or influence at the expense

531
00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:50.835
of seeking holiness before God.

532
00:30:53.435 --> 00:30:54.695
That's got to be primary.

533
00:30:55.435 --> 00:30:57.895
That's why nearly all the qualifications

534
00:30:57.915 --> 00:31:01.055
of a church leader in scripture are character based.

535
00:31:02.325 --> 00:31:03.655
It's not skill-based.

536
00:31:04.155 --> 00:31:06.695
You have to be able to handle the word, but it's character

537
00:31:06.925 --> 00:31:08.895
because faithfulness matters first.

538
00:31:12.825 --> 00:31:14.525
But here's the reality. Yes, things happen.

539
00:31:14.545 --> 00:31:17.805
We see it exposed around us almost every week it seems.

540
00:31:17.945 --> 00:31:21.325
But the reality is that not everything will get exposed

541
00:31:21.325 --> 00:31:22.405
before Jesus returns.

542
00:31:26.035 --> 00:31:27.335
Yes, we have an obligation

543
00:31:27.335 --> 00:31:29.615
to call one another toward faithfulness here

544
00:31:29.615 --> 00:31:31.695
and now God's spirit's gonna use his word

545
00:31:31.955 --> 00:31:33.575
to convict us, to change us.

546
00:31:33.575 --> 00:31:34.775
That's part of the deal.

547
00:31:35.075 --> 00:31:38.255
But in the end, the only thing you can take responsibility

548
00:31:38.355 --> 00:31:40.295
for is yourself.

549
00:31:44.315 --> 00:31:47.375
Are you being faithful to God? Am I being faithful to God?

550
00:31:47.715 --> 00:31:51.415
Am I seeking to know and obey his word?

551
00:31:52.515 --> 00:31:56.295
Am I leaning on his faithfulness for me, his life, death

552
00:31:56.295 --> 00:31:58.695
and resurrection for me when I fail?

553
00:32:01.085 --> 00:32:03.015
Like, do I remember that Keller said this?

554
00:32:03.035 --> 00:32:05.975
Do I remember that? I am more sinful than I could ever

555
00:32:05.975 --> 00:32:10.695
imagine, yet I am more loved than I could ever dare hope.

556
00:32:12.215 --> 00:32:13.465
Like is that where I'm at?

557
00:32:13.485 --> 00:32:15.705
And I just see, yes, I wanna be faithful God,

558
00:32:15.765 --> 00:32:17.265
I'm not gonna be, but thank you for grace

559
00:32:17.445 --> 00:32:19.105
and I pursue you in that.

560
00:32:19.205 --> 00:32:21.705
Is that where I'm at? Those are great questions to ask

561
00:32:23.945 --> 00:32:25.605
as God exposes our hearts in light

562
00:32:25.605 --> 00:32:27.405
of the future, light of his return.

563
00:32:28.555 --> 00:32:31.965
Like yes, we need to all, all the time, self examine God,

564
00:32:32.115 --> 00:32:33.965
show me Psalm 1 39.

565
00:32:33.965 --> 00:32:35.685
Is there any wicked way within me?

566
00:32:37.985 --> 00:32:39.925
But here's what happens with a passage like this.

567
00:32:42.755 --> 00:32:44.695
We so often make it only negative.

568
00:32:46.905 --> 00:32:50.355
Like we get this picture of, of some scary old man, like,

569
00:32:50.445 --> 00:32:53.075
God's gonna judge you, be a good boy, right?

570
00:32:53.105 --> 00:32:56.755
Like that's kinda what it feels like at times. Scary.

571
00:33:00.415 --> 00:33:02.275
But what are the last few words of verse five?

572
00:33:02.295 --> 00:33:06.295
Did you see it? God brings things to light,

573
00:33:06.655 --> 00:33:07.775
discloses motivations.

574
00:33:07.775 --> 00:33:08.975
Look at the end of verse five.

575
00:33:10.285 --> 00:33:14.135
Then each one will receive his commendation from God.

576
00:33:18.685 --> 00:33:21.185
See, that's why we can't judge perfectly accurately

577
00:33:21.725 --> 00:33:22.985
before the Lord comes,

578
00:33:25.125 --> 00:33:27.255
because first, he's the only one who can.

579
00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:29.615
He's the only one who can see our hearts.

580
00:33:31.555 --> 00:33:34.695
But also because what we may think is success

581
00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:40.875
may actually be motivated by sinful desires, by pride,

582
00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:42.875
by wrong perspectives, all of that.

583
00:33:43.215 --> 00:33:45.675
So we can't just say it's because it's great,

584
00:33:46.855 --> 00:33:51.165
but also what we might deem a failure.

585
00:33:54.515 --> 00:33:59.215
Again, church culture, a small church or

586
00:33:59.215 --> 00:34:01.055
or someone who doesn't have all the notoriety

587
00:34:01.055 --> 00:34:02.055
that certain people have,

588
00:34:04.295 --> 00:34:06.155
or no one ever sees anything that

589
00:34:06.155 --> 00:34:09.515
that person does when hidden things are exposed,

590
00:34:11.095 --> 00:34:12.835
God blesses faithfulness.

591
00:34:14.265 --> 00:34:18.035
Even when it's quiet, even when it is hidden.

592
00:34:19.985 --> 00:34:23.205
That's what's praised by God. Think about it.

593
00:34:23.205 --> 00:34:25.085
There are so many faithful things done

594
00:34:25.235 --> 00:34:28.085
that no one else ever sees.

595
00:34:30.195 --> 00:34:33.725
It's not just because people can perform or

596
00:34:33.745 --> 00:34:37.485
or can produce or have large followings.

597
00:34:37.555 --> 00:34:38.885
It's so much.

598
00:34:38.945 --> 00:34:42.565
No one else sees a cup of water to someone who is thirsty,

599
00:34:42.655 --> 00:34:47.125
comforting a child, caring for a sick spouse

600
00:34:47.265 --> 00:34:49.645
for years in the quiet places,

601
00:34:52.945 --> 00:34:57.355
turning from pornography, sitting

602
00:34:57.355 --> 00:35:01.795
with the abused, praying diligently for others,

603
00:35:03.635 --> 00:35:05.565
writing an encouragement note to someone,

604
00:35:08.675 --> 00:35:10.885
sitting next to someone on a plane, sharing the gospel,

605
00:35:12.725 --> 00:35:15.765
studying scripture devoted, tearful over it

606
00:35:16.885 --> 00:35:18.105
and on and on and on.

607
00:35:18.105 --> 00:35:20.625
We could go. It doesn't make a global impact,

608
00:35:23.535 --> 00:35:28.405
but God sees it and

609
00:35:28.405 --> 00:35:31.045
he rewards those who are faithfully building

610
00:35:31.045 --> 00:35:33.805
with the good stones of faithful life.

611
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:41.075
That's why Paul, even though he was being criticized,

612
00:35:41.865 --> 00:35:44.955
doubted, even at times abandoned.

613
00:35:48.065 --> 00:35:49.485
That's why he could carry on

614
00:35:50.985 --> 00:35:54.525
and wait for the eternal praise from God

615
00:35:56.695 --> 00:35:58.505
because it wasn't a clean conscience

616
00:35:59.525 --> 00:36:02.745
or his effort that brought that praise.

617
00:36:04.005 --> 00:36:07.065
It was the gospel truth of Jesus and him crucified for him.

618
00:36:09.075 --> 00:36:11.045
It's the same for us. Listen, if God chooses

619
00:36:11.045 --> 00:36:14.485
to bring fruit from our faithfulness, great, we'd love that.

620
00:36:15.835 --> 00:36:19.175
But if he doesn't, that's not why we're seeking

621
00:36:19.175 --> 00:36:22.775
to be faithful anyway just for fruit.

622
00:36:23.115 --> 00:36:26.055
No, it's because of Second Corinthians five,

623
00:36:26.225 --> 00:36:28.255
verse nine says, whether we are at home

624
00:36:28.355 --> 00:36:31.375
or away, we make it our aim to please him.

625
00:36:33.285 --> 00:36:36.775
Meaning if it's an audience of one, it's no one else.

626
00:36:41.735 --> 00:36:43.395
We serve a faithful God.

627
00:36:45.475 --> 00:36:49.555
A God that is so faithful that he makes us faithful

628
00:36:49.665 --> 00:36:51.475
through Jesus Christ in our place.

629
00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:55.355
And he gives us faithfulness as a fruit

630
00:36:55.355 --> 00:36:56.955
of his spirit inside of us.

631
00:37:00.055 --> 00:37:02.755
So lean into that rest in that

632
00:37:04.535 --> 00:37:06.875
as we seek to be faithful to our faithful God.

633
00:37:08.065 --> 00:37:09.655
Let's ask him for help towards that now.
