WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:01.525
Okay.

2
00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:05.925
So, um,

3
00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:08.645
You were talking about being a nerd.

4
00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.765
I like how she reminded you of that. Maybe not a tape.

5
00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:15.805
Oh, I'll move her, I'll

6
00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:18.485
Move her here because I want to have that thing in there.

7
00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:23.645
Um, yeah. You know that, that got captured on the recording.

8
00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:28.165
That kind started off. Yeah, it did.

9
00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:32.685
Uh, that'll be the first thing people hear about tonight.

10
00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:33.925
So, and they won't

11
00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:34.925
Believe it.

12
00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.965
Okay. But one of my hobbies was making model airplanes.

13
00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:41.325
And, uh, I just loved to do that.

14
00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:45.845
And I'd make these mostly World War II fighting

15
00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:49.365
planes, and once I made them, I would,

16
00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:51.125
I would sometimes paint 'em

17
00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:54.365
and hang them on the ceiling from in my bedroom.

18
00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:57.045
Fortunately, my older brother put up with that.

19
00:00:57.785 --> 00:00:59.725
He didn't deny me that opportunity

20
00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.725
and had a lot of fun doing that.

21
00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:04.525
And, uh, that was all kind of capped off

22
00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:08.725
after, um, we had our son

23
00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:13.005
and, uh, he, he joined our family.

24
00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:16.325
And when he got to be about the same age

25
00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:17.805
that I started making models, I,

26
00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:19.125
I introduced him to making it.

27
00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.165
And he seemed to like that. And we decided

28
00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:24.725
to make a B 24 bomber together,

29
00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:29.885
because that was the plane that my dad helped build

30
00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:31.005
during World ii.

31
00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:36.325
And, uh, so we made this B 24 bomber,

32
00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:39.445
and we really took our time, made it really look good,

33
00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:42.485
and painted it, and then we presented it to my father.

34
00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:45.365
Mm-Hmm. And, uh,

35
00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:48.045
he was kind of an emotional guy.

36
00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:50.885
He just didn't have permission to share emotions,

37
00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:53.965
but he, he got tears in his eyes.

38
00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.165
It really meant a lot to him.

39
00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:57.725
And my mom gave it back to us when he died.

40
00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:00.045
So my son has that now.

41
00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:04.445
So, what was your hobby that brought you joy?

42
00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:05.485
Share that with your spouse.

43
00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:09.205
And this is, we're actually doing a bible verse

44
00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:13.565
about relating, and it's Romans 1215.

45
00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:16.405
It says, rejoice with those who rejoice. Mm-Hmm.

46
00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:19.605
We're commanded to do that. Would you all agree with me?

47
00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:22.805
We don't do much enough of that. Yeah.

48
00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:24.325
We're not talking about worship.

49
00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:27.965
I think we do a good job in, at least in this church

50
00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:30.645
of worshiping, but I'm talking about just rejoicing

51
00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:34.165
with one another, making much of fun,

52
00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:35.725
happy, good things.

53
00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:38.805
So take turns sharing, rejoice with each other.

54
00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:40.205
If somebody jumps up

55
00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:41.645
and down, we're not gonna throw you outta here.

56
00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:43.805
It's okay. But go right ahead.

57
00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:57.965
I should try to help me

58
00:02:58.365 --> 00:02:59.365
Remember that. 'cause once I get

59
00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:00.085
going, I just,

60
00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:01.045
the back.

61
00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:49.185
You try to,

62
00:06:58.095 --> 00:07:01.125
We'll take another minute or so and then I'll wrap.

63
00:08:41.715 --> 00:08:42.715
Okay.

64
00:08:43.785 --> 00:08:46.645
Did you build any models from 12 o'clock High?

65
00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:49.605
Remember the show 12 o'clock High?

66
00:08:50.985 --> 00:08:53.245
No. I, I remember the title of

67
00:08:53.245 --> 00:08:54.765
that movie, but I don't remember

68
00:08:54.765 --> 00:08:55.765
Seeing the movie.

69
00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:57.565
It was a World

70
00:08:57.585 --> 00:08:58.585
War II Yeah. TV

71
00:08:58.585 --> 00:09:02.205
show and it probably from planes coming from the

72
00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:03.605
Bombers or fire.

73
00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:07.645
Yeah. Yeah. I tell you, I've read a lot of books

74
00:09:07.835 --> 00:09:11.805
that are from that era and, uh, watch a lot of movies.

75
00:09:12.225 --> 00:09:14.325
But that one, if I saw it,

76
00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:16.765
I probably saw it way back there, so.

77
00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:19.445
Okay.

78
00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:27.265
All right. So emotionality,

79
00:09:28.805 --> 00:09:30.585
how did your family handle

80
00:09:30.665 --> 00:09:35.145
emotions, Rosa?

81
00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:42.465
I couldn't miss that. You had a recall there of some sort,

82
00:09:42.605 --> 00:09:45.505
but, uh, I'm not asking you to necessarily go here.

83
00:09:45.615 --> 00:09:47.665
It's just, you know, one of those things, when you think

84
00:09:48.215 --> 00:09:50.225
Italian family, welcome

85
00:09:50.325 --> 00:09:52.105
to the first thing that comes to mind.

86
00:09:52.505 --> 00:09:54.025
Yeah. It's expression,

87
00:09:56.145 --> 00:09:57.265
Fireworks and expression.

88
00:09:57.445 --> 00:09:58.445
And

89
00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:01.105
Very animated people. Yeah.

90
00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:02.945
They're Still pretty animated. Yeah.

91
00:10:02.945 --> 00:10:04.145
They're still very animated.

92
00:10:04.325 --> 00:10:07.865
So it did not teach you to stuff your emotions, right?

93
00:10:08.685 --> 00:10:10.345
How do you know? No, not

94
00:10:10.345 --> 00:10:11.345
Really. No, I wouldn't

95
00:10:11.345 --> 00:10:12.025
likely do that.

96
00:10:12.325 --> 00:10:15.945
That's just mainly explosive, which is just as bad.

97
00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:18.425
Well, and it can be hard

98
00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:21.105
to get in a wording edgewise sometimes when the culture

99
00:10:21.285 --> 00:10:22.585
is, is more like that.

100
00:10:23.525 --> 00:10:27.705
Um, anybody else in here with a German ancestry?

101
00:10:29.335 --> 00:10:34.185
Yeah. Uh, well, that didn't mean

102
00:10:34.185 --> 00:10:35.785
that nobody got to show emotions,

103
00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:38.385
but it meant it was restricted to a certain one.

104
00:10:39.175 --> 00:10:41.585
Mama, mama, Mama istic.

105
00:10:41.765 --> 00:10:46.345
But, um, the rest of us were not expressing as much.

106
00:10:46.765 --> 00:10:48.745
So anyway, that was part of our background.

107
00:10:49.765 --> 00:10:53.585
So, um, I remembered, uh,

108
00:10:55.185 --> 00:10:57.385
a time the other night, this might have been the thing

109
00:10:57.385 --> 00:10:58.425
that I was trying to think of.

110
00:10:58.605 --> 00:11:01.985
We were Friday night at a meeting with the louder backs

111
00:11:01.985 --> 00:11:04.465
that if you were at the workshop, you remember them.

112
00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.905
And, uh, they have a ministry that's a nonprofit,

113
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:09.785
and we were at a meeting of the board

114
00:11:10.765 --> 00:11:15.345
and, um, we, we were celebrating

115
00:11:16.405 --> 00:11:18.985
the history of where they've come from, the things

116
00:11:18.985 --> 00:11:21.345
that they've had, the adversities they've had to go through,

117
00:11:21.885 --> 00:11:25.265
and just the amazing way that God was working to

118
00:11:25.895 --> 00:11:28.785
move them forward in their ministry in spite

119
00:11:28.785 --> 00:11:33.465
of things like she shared about having cancer a second time.

120
00:11:34.405 --> 00:11:37.705
And yet God's kind of unfolding some new chapters for them

121
00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:39.225
and how they're gonna do this thing.

122
00:11:39.645 --> 00:11:41.465
And, uh, so that was a,

123
00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:44.905
that's a real rejoicing experience like that.

124
00:11:45.525 --> 00:11:47.425
And I may have shared, I don't remember

125
00:11:47.445 --> 00:11:49.985
for sure about when I was 23

126
00:11:50.045 --> 00:11:52.985
and I had my 23rd birthday in New York City

127
00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.925
after moving there a week before.

128
00:11:55.745 --> 00:11:56.845
And I was working

129
00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:59.045
with some people in a nonprofit organization,

130
00:11:59.145 --> 00:12:00.165
and I knew some of them

131
00:12:00.225 --> 00:12:01.685
and didn't know some of the others yet.

132
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.685
But they took me out

133
00:12:03.705 --> 00:12:06.525
to a restaurant in Greenwich Village, a Greek restaurant.

134
00:12:07.945 --> 00:12:10.485
And, and they're not too far from Italy, right?

135
00:12:10.825 --> 00:12:13.645
Greece and Italy. Actually, I had actually, uh,

136
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:15.045
worked in a Greek restaurant.

137
00:12:15.115 --> 00:12:18.725
Okay. So I, I understand there's a major restaurant.

138
00:12:19.945 --> 00:12:24.055
So here I am, new kid on the block,

139
00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:28.215
they're throwing a birthday party for me at this restaurant.

140
00:12:28.275 --> 00:12:31.735
And it's a lively atmosphere, great food,

141
00:12:33.155 --> 00:12:36.735
uh, someone singing with a string instrument.

142
00:12:37.315 --> 00:12:39.815
And, uh, of course the only song we knew was,

143
00:12:39.815 --> 00:12:41.055
or of the Greek, I think.

144
00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:43.535
But, but it was a great time.

145
00:12:43.915 --> 00:12:46.575
And that was the first time I remember since I was about

146
00:12:46.575 --> 00:12:51.095
five or six years old being celebrated in any way, shape

147
00:12:51.095 --> 00:12:52.295
or fashion that looked like that.

148
00:12:52.835 --> 00:12:55.295
And I just remember how deeply it touched me.

149
00:12:55.835 --> 00:13:00.665
But these people who barely knew me, were making much

150
00:13:00.885 --> 00:13:03.505
of, it's your birthday, let's celebrate that.

151
00:13:04.495 --> 00:13:07.825
Well, I don't think Jesus had a hard time celebrating

152
00:13:08.845 --> 00:13:10.145
or having fun like

153
00:13:10.145 --> 00:13:12.425
that based on some references in scripture.

154
00:13:14.485 --> 00:13:18.625
Um, so I mentioned earlier, we don't celebrate enough

155
00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:22.505
or rejoice enough that I would also say, I'm not sure we do

156
00:13:23.225 --> 00:13:25.065
actually do enough with the Bible.

157
00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:27.585
See, we don't do enough.

158
00:13:27.725 --> 00:13:31.465
If all we do is obtain the cognitive information in our

159
00:13:31.465 --> 00:13:34.345
brain and memorize it, that's still not enough.

160
00:13:34.405 --> 00:13:36.065
We have to experience it.

161
00:13:36.765 --> 00:13:38.745
So when it says rejoice with those rejoice,

162
00:13:38.805 --> 00:13:39.985
it really means rejoice.

163
00:13:40.685 --> 00:13:43.665
It really means experience something between you

164
00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:48.465
that is actually positive, reflecting to positive.

165
00:13:49.645 --> 00:13:51.825
And don't miss that scientists are just

166
00:13:51.825 --> 00:13:52.945
now figuring all that out.

167
00:13:54.685 --> 00:13:56.505
Um, tonight though,

168
00:13:56.505 --> 00:14:00.585
we're gonna work primarily on the other half of that verse,

169
00:14:00.925 --> 00:14:04.905
the mourn with those who mourn or weep with those who weep,

170
00:14:04.905 --> 00:14:09.345
because that's where we oftentimes have not experienced

171
00:14:09.345 --> 00:14:12.505
what we need to experience when we're the ones that are sad,

172
00:14:12.925 --> 00:14:14.705
or we're the ones that are grieving

173
00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:18.625
or have experienced a loss or disappointment.

174
00:14:20.205 --> 00:14:25.145
And a lot of people try very hard to respond to someone

175
00:14:25.285 --> 00:14:27.985
who has experienced a loss or sadness,

176
00:14:29.005 --> 00:14:30.545
but they haven't been trained.

177
00:14:31.325 --> 00:14:33.425
And I'm not talking about clinical training.

178
00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:38.265
I'm just, no one has really shown them what really helps

179
00:14:39.425 --> 00:14:42.865
a person when they are, when their heart is sad or broken.

180
00:14:43.655 --> 00:14:44.945
Okay. So we're gonna look at

181
00:14:44.945 --> 00:14:46.625
what does the Bible teach about that?

182
00:14:48.045 --> 00:14:51.325
Um, I want to pass out, um,

183
00:14:54.235 --> 00:14:55.445
Another handout.

184
00:14:59.075 --> 00:15:00.805
There's one, There's enough

185
00:15:00.805 --> 00:15:03.845
for one per couple on this one.

186
00:15:04.415 --> 00:15:04.885
Thank you.

187
00:15:11.275 --> 00:15:11.885
This is what

188
00:15:11.885 --> 00:15:14.645
We call the pain and potential chart.

189
00:15:15.785 --> 00:15:18.165
Did they get one? Yeah, it's going around. Okay.

190
00:15:20.035 --> 00:15:21.205
Pain and potential chart.

191
00:15:21.235 --> 00:15:22.965
It's referring to the relational needs,

192
00:15:22.985 --> 00:15:26.405
but there's a, there's a real strong emotional part of this.

193
00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:28.885
But if you just glance at this

194
00:15:28.905 --> 00:15:31.605
and look at the top half of it, it's basically saying

195
00:15:31.605 --> 00:15:35.685
that when a person's relational needs are being met

196
00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:40.165
effectively in their relationships, it tends

197
00:15:40.225 --> 00:15:43.005
to influence them to have healthy thoughts about themselves.

198
00:15:44.785 --> 00:15:47.445
It tends to evoke positive emotions.

199
00:15:47.595 --> 00:15:50.085
When your needs are met, you feel loved, you feel cared for,

200
00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:52.765
you feel attended to, you might feel supported.

201
00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:55.085
But those are positive feelings

202
00:15:56.185 --> 00:16:00.885
and it that will motivate, not force,

203
00:16:01.105 --> 00:16:03.245
but motivate productive behaviors.

204
00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:07.935
So when a person's fitting loved, they typically

205
00:16:08.675 --> 00:16:10.215
are grateful for that

206
00:16:10.715 --> 00:16:13.335
unless they've learned somehow to dismiss

207
00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:14.815
what was done for them.

208
00:16:16.235 --> 00:16:19.695
And then that leads them into more potential for having

209
00:16:20.455 --> 00:16:22.215
positive long-term outcomes.

210
00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:26.055
But if the needs are not met, especially if

211
00:16:26.055 --> 00:16:28.815
that's happening when the person is a child

212
00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:31.495
and incapable of controlling their environment.

213
00:16:32.475 --> 00:16:34.295
So if those needs are not being met,

214
00:16:34.675 --> 00:16:38.175
it can leave them thinking negative thoughts about

215
00:16:38.175 --> 00:16:41.135
themselves, about life, about, uh, others.

216
00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:45.975
Uh, it can definitely stir up a lot of emotional, uh,

217
00:16:45.975 --> 00:16:47.455
painful emotional feelings.

218
00:16:47.515 --> 00:16:49.775
And if those emotions are not cared for

219
00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:52.455
or healed, they accumulate.

220
00:16:53.395 --> 00:16:57.975
Now, the way they accumulate is not like you're full

221
00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:01.735
of negative emotions and, and you never get out of that.

222
00:17:02.085 --> 00:17:05.655
It's like they store up in your brain, in, in your memories.

223
00:17:06.765 --> 00:17:08.615
It's not like you're feeling them all the time.

224
00:17:08.685 --> 00:17:12.815
It's when something reminds you of one of those painful me,

225
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.855
uh, feelings that you had earlier in life.

226
00:17:17.405 --> 00:17:22.055
It's as if it compounds your current feelings.

227
00:17:24.435 --> 00:17:25.435
So, for example,

228
00:17:27.555 --> 00:17:30.975
Um, I have shared

229
00:17:31.045 --> 00:17:34.655
that one thing I got a lot of from a mother who truly loved,

230
00:17:34.945 --> 00:17:36.935
loved her children and loved me,

231
00:17:38.195 --> 00:17:42.415
but, uh, I got a lot of criticism from her and no praise.

232
00:17:43.755 --> 00:17:46.815
So it's a heavy imbalance of that's not right.

233
00:17:47.035 --> 00:17:50.085
Do it, do it again. Uh, why do you miss

234
00:17:50.085 --> 00:17:53.405
that one on the test when the, the grade was still good?

235
00:17:54.385 --> 00:17:57.605
So I got a lot of that, that was really part

236
00:17:57.605 --> 00:18:01.045
of my normal weekend, week out experience of life.

237
00:18:02.065 --> 00:18:04.485
Uh, I would never say she was fully abusive.

238
00:18:05.065 --> 00:18:08.765
It was just heavy on criticism,

239
00:18:09.835 --> 00:18:11.125
very lacking on praise.

240
00:18:13.015 --> 00:18:14.835
And that definitely influenced me.

241
00:18:16.735 --> 00:18:20.755
Um, so when I get married and my bride

242
00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.175
after a four month courtship,

243
00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:26.135
during which I don't remember her

244
00:18:26.695 --> 00:18:27.975
criticizing me a single time,

245
00:18:29.715 --> 00:18:31.655
and she seemed heavy on approval

246
00:18:31.795 --> 00:18:36.575
and praise, when she starts experiencing some

247
00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:39.935
disappointment in my way of treating her, guess what?

248
00:18:41.275 --> 00:18:43.775
Little frown start to show up on her face.

249
00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:46.015
Little comments start to leak out,

250
00:18:46.755 --> 00:18:50.975
and I start to have a meltdown with a little comment.

251
00:18:51.895 --> 00:18:55.415
A $500 reaction to a 50 cent comment. Mm-Hmm mm-Hmm.

252
00:18:56.675 --> 00:18:58.655
Now the question is, why did I blow up?

253
00:18:58.715 --> 00:19:01.935
I'm not even a, I'm not Italian. I can't help it.

254
00:19:02.915 --> 00:19:04.255
Not what Italian.

255
00:19:04.595 --> 00:19:08.575
Oh, so why did I blow up?

256
00:19:08.755 --> 00:19:13.415
And I'm gonna say in a very simple way of,

257
00:19:14.555 --> 00:19:16.975
of something that's really complex in the brain,

258
00:19:17.075 --> 00:19:20.495
but um, my brain just said, this

259
00:19:22.015 --> 00:19:24.495
critical minor comment

260
00:19:26.715 --> 00:19:31.495
is close enough to the negative words said

261
00:19:31.495 --> 00:19:36.255
to you frequently that left you feeling small all the time.

262
00:19:37.765 --> 00:19:40.575
That we are gonna have a meltdown internally,

263
00:19:40.765 --> 00:19:42.775
even if you don't express it externally.

264
00:19:44.765 --> 00:19:48.615
It's like, we're just going to add all

265
00:19:48.615 --> 00:19:51.055
of those previous memories on top

266
00:19:51.055 --> 00:19:53.375
of this one in milliseconds.

267
00:19:53.715 --> 00:19:55.575
So you can't even tell that's what's going on.

268
00:19:56.835 --> 00:19:58.975
Now, if you want to know anything more about this,

269
00:19:59.035 --> 00:20:02.695
you can read about the amygdala and amygdala hijacks

270
00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:05.215
and fight or flight

271
00:20:05.995 --> 00:20:09.335
or freeze mechanisms that the brain is designed to have

272
00:20:09.335 --> 00:20:10.895
to help protect you.

273
00:20:11.725 --> 00:20:14.255
They're actually designed by a good God who knows

274
00:20:14.285 --> 00:20:15.495
that you might need that.

275
00:20:16.755 --> 00:20:20.655
But the problem is when the $500

276
00:20:22.655 --> 00:20:26.415
comments are not being made, it's a 50 cent comment

277
00:20:26.485 --> 00:20:29.415
that could be fairly easily worked through

278
00:20:30.635 --> 00:20:32.895
if you didn't already have that predisposition.

279
00:20:33.075 --> 00:20:36.335
So the amygdala hijack just crams it all together.

280
00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:40.095
You have immediate flooding of your body and brain.

281
00:20:40.325 --> 00:20:42.535
Your brain floods your body with adrenaline.

282
00:20:42.915 --> 00:20:44.815
The next thing you know, you're flying outta

283
00:20:44.815 --> 00:20:46.015
here or you're attacking.

284
00:20:47.345 --> 00:20:48.685
But we don't want that to be

285
00:20:48.685 --> 00:20:50.645
what typifies our relationships.

286
00:20:51.315 --> 00:20:53.725
Okay? So good news is there's healing for that.

287
00:20:54.425 --> 00:20:58.325
Second thing is, that's what's kind of depicted on here,

288
00:20:58.585 --> 00:21:00.845
is if you've gone through a whole lot

289
00:21:00.845 --> 00:21:02.565
of times when needs weren't met,

290
00:21:05.105 --> 00:21:07.525
you may have an accumulation of memories

291
00:21:07.595 --> 00:21:10.365
that may benefit from going back

292
00:21:10.465 --> 00:21:13.645
and saying, I remember a time when

293
00:21:14.865 --> 00:21:16.045
my brother moved away,

294
00:21:16.865 --> 00:21:21.685
or I remember a time when my best friend moved away

295
00:21:23.305 --> 00:21:24.725
and share that with Joyce

296
00:21:24.745 --> 00:21:27.445
and her now know how to comfort me for that.

297
00:21:27.965 --> 00:21:30.205
'cause we weren't trained to do that. Okay?

298
00:21:31.105 --> 00:21:34.445
So that's the pain and potential, how that ties together

299
00:21:35.265 --> 00:21:37.565
and motivates behavior, including, uh,

300
00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:39.445
meltdowns, things like that.

301
00:21:41.865 --> 00:21:46.165
So the emotional cup is the framework

302
00:21:46.195 --> 00:21:49.245
that David Ferguson developed for trying to explain

303
00:21:50.025 --> 00:21:51.765
how is your brain designed to work

304
00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:55.405
and what happens with your emotions.

305
00:21:56.145 --> 00:21:58.045
So we draw this picture of a cup,

306
00:21:59.065 --> 00:22:01.205
and again, I know this won't be the first time for some

307
00:22:01.405 --> 00:22:04.085
of you, but I want, this is so important to understanding

308
00:22:04.985 --> 00:22:08.485
what's going on when I start to experience emotion.

309
00:22:09.065 --> 00:22:11.885
So if this is a portion of my brain

310
00:22:12.025 --> 00:22:15.445
or different pieces that I'm just saying, it's like a cup.

311
00:22:15.445 --> 00:22:17.205
It's holding the emotion in a sense.

312
00:22:17.945 --> 00:22:21.885
And when a negative life event occurs, it's going

313
00:22:21.885 --> 00:22:24.565
to stir up some kind of emotion in me,

314
00:22:24.585 --> 00:22:28.005
but it won't be joy if it's a negative life event.

315
00:22:28.185 --> 00:22:31.805
It won't be happiness, it won't be, uh, I'm feeling blessed.

316
00:22:32.385 --> 00:22:34.125
No, it's gonna feel painful.

317
00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:39.405
And a lot of that will end up being a form of hurt,

318
00:22:40.275 --> 00:22:43.925
sadness, sorrow, disappointment, rejection, betrayal.

319
00:22:44.055 --> 00:22:46.765
Those are all vulnerable emotions

320
00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:49.725
that are hurtful in some way.

321
00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:53.965
And a lot of life events are like that. Okay?

322
00:22:56.865 --> 00:22:58.565
My basketball team lost yesterday.

323
00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:00.125
That's a very trivial example,

324
00:23:00.405 --> 00:23:03.005
but it left me frustrated and hurt.

325
00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:05.365
Frustrated goes up here. This is anger.

326
00:23:07.145 --> 00:23:10.045
And that includes everything from just being mildly

327
00:23:10.115 --> 00:23:11.885
irritated or annoyed

328
00:23:12.185 --> 00:23:16.645
or frustrated to rageful, feeling rage,

329
00:23:17.075 --> 00:23:21.165
feeling deep hostility in my heart.

330
00:23:22.825 --> 00:23:25.045
Uh, then there's the category of fear,

331
00:23:25.335 --> 00:23:26.845
which includes anxiety.

332
00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:31.525
Even worry, we would tend to think in these terms,

333
00:23:33.035 --> 00:23:37.325
fear where in that case, I'm anticipating

334
00:23:37.355 --> 00:23:39.165
that something bad might happen,

335
00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:43.245
but I'm probably remembering things that were similar

336
00:23:43.315 --> 00:23:46.685
that happened already, but now I'm projecting.

337
00:23:46.755 --> 00:23:50.445
Well, that's probably gonna happen too. Okay?

338
00:23:50.675 --> 00:23:53.605
I've been rejected so often when I got up

339
00:23:53.605 --> 00:23:56.005
to go ask Joyce if she wanted to play tennis in

340
00:23:56.005 --> 00:23:58.405
that restaurant, there was a little fear at

341
00:23:58.405 --> 00:23:59.525
work in me, okay?

342
00:23:59.915 --> 00:24:02.725
Because I had not always had people say, of course,

343
00:24:03.085 --> 00:24:05.435
I would see.

344
00:24:06.255 --> 00:24:09.195
So my brain remembering past hurt

345
00:24:10.175 --> 00:24:12.915
can actually use that to feed into my fear.

346
00:24:14.415 --> 00:24:17.355
We would also say that underneath all anger is hurt.

347
00:24:20.145 --> 00:24:22.325
If you see an angry person, chances are

348
00:24:23.275 --> 00:24:26.285
they also are experiencing some hurt,

349
00:24:26.585 --> 00:24:29.005
but the anger has sort of dominated.

350
00:24:29.305 --> 00:24:31.485
That's what they'll be able to tell you they're feeling.

351
00:24:32.065 --> 00:24:34.245
Unless you say, well, what else are you feeling?

352
00:24:34.485 --> 00:24:36.645
I can see you're angry. Thank you

353
00:24:36.645 --> 00:24:38.485
for telling me, but what else are you feeling?

354
00:24:38.545 --> 00:24:41.125
And oftentimes they'll say, well, disrespected, I say, well,

355
00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:44.005
that's not apol, that's not a strong emotion.

356
00:24:44.005 --> 00:24:45.565
That's a, I mean, it's an important emotion,

357
00:24:45.825 --> 00:24:47.165
but that's a vulnerable emotion.

358
00:24:47.685 --> 00:24:50.765
Disrespected, I feel cheated.

359
00:24:50.955 --> 00:24:52.725
Well, that's a vulnerable emotion,

360
00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:56.005
but that might lead them to feel angry.

361
00:24:56.315 --> 00:24:58.685
Okay? It may happen in millisecond.

362
00:24:59.795 --> 00:25:01.205
Then another type

363
00:25:01.205 --> 00:25:04.565
of emotion is guilt different than the first three.

364
00:25:05.665 --> 00:25:08.125
And it's tied to your behavior.

365
00:25:09.745 --> 00:25:12.445
Either something that you have done

366
00:25:12.705 --> 00:25:16.085
or failed to do that violates your conscience

367
00:25:16.085 --> 00:25:19.285
or your sense of God's principles.

368
00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:23.765
Um, finally, condemnation.

369
00:25:25.765 --> 00:25:29.075
These would be feelings that are not about your behavior,

370
00:25:29.335 --> 00:25:31.595
but your sense of identity.

371
00:25:35.975 --> 00:25:37.115
If I were to ask you today,

372
00:25:41.185 --> 00:25:43.115
what is your identity from a

373
00:25:44.425 --> 00:25:48.435
born again Christian perspective, what's your identity?

374
00:25:50.355 --> 00:25:52.235
I probably ought to put Carrie on the spot here,

375
00:25:52.255 --> 00:25:53.755
but she just took a drink of something.

376
00:25:53.815 --> 00:25:56.235
Yes. What what's your identity?

377
00:25:56.975 --> 00:26:01.075
Um, who are you from a Christian perspective,

378
00:26:01.455 --> 00:26:02.455
I'm a child of God.

379
00:26:02.775 --> 00:26:05.155
I'm a child of God, thank you. That that'll do.

380
00:26:05.425 --> 00:26:07.155
There's other ways to answer that question,

381
00:26:07.375 --> 00:26:12.035
but yeah, I'm a beloved child of God, right?

382
00:26:13.705 --> 00:26:16.075
Even though I trust you're not yet perfect,

383
00:26:17.615 --> 00:26:21.075
but you're still, your identity is not

384
00:26:21.265 --> 00:26:24.595
what you do, who you are.

385
00:26:27.025 --> 00:26:31.075
Okay? So feelings of condemnation tied

386
00:26:31.135 --> 00:26:33.475
to a sense that I'm not enough,

387
00:26:34.855 --> 00:26:36.315
or that if you really knew me,

388
00:26:36.335 --> 00:26:38.515
you wouldn't think highly of me either.

389
00:26:40.585 --> 00:26:41.955
It's a sense of who you are,

390
00:26:42.015 --> 00:26:46.525
but it may not be consistent with you're a child

391
00:26:46.525 --> 00:26:48.965
of God, a beloved child of God.

392
00:26:50.555 --> 00:26:54.135
And even though the Holy Spirit still may be working

393
00:26:54.205 --> 00:26:56.055
with you on certain behaviors,

394
00:26:57.565 --> 00:27:00.055
that doesn't change who you are.

395
00:27:01.045 --> 00:27:05.295
Okay? So what happens is, as we go through the life,

396
00:27:05.755 --> 00:27:09.055
if these are not being emptied out of us, instead

397
00:27:09.055 --> 00:27:13.495
of suppressed or held onto automatically, then

398
00:27:14.445 --> 00:27:15.655
they're going to build up

399
00:27:16.075 --> 00:27:19.415
and they're gonna keep potentially

400
00:27:21.525 --> 00:27:22.775
driving symptoms.

401
00:27:23.045 --> 00:27:24.695
Some of these symptoms are physical.

402
00:27:26.165 --> 00:27:28.935
This, by the way, is on page 77 in your book

403
00:27:29.155 --> 00:27:30.295
if you want to see the diagram.

404
00:27:31.615 --> 00:27:32.655
Physical, behavioral,

405
00:27:36.675 --> 00:27:41.295
uh, some involves, uh, escapes into things

406
00:27:41.325 --> 00:27:45.295
that make us feel temporarily better, including alcohol,

407
00:27:45.425 --> 00:27:50.375
drugs, porn, various kinds of escapes, even some

408
00:27:50.375 --> 00:27:55.295
that don't sound so bad, like pleasure seeking, even in ways

409
00:27:55.295 --> 00:27:56.815
that are not considered immoral.

410
00:27:57.445 --> 00:28:02.215
Okay? I could be addicted to video games that are not in

411
00:28:02.215 --> 00:28:05.455
and of themselves, bad images or stuff like that,

412
00:28:05.555 --> 00:28:08.455
but I could be addicted to them where

413
00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:11.055
they're starting to control my life.

414
00:28:12.185 --> 00:28:15.655
Those are escapes and can become addictions.

415
00:28:17.885 --> 00:28:21.615
There's things like difficulty sleeping, difficulty

416
00:28:21.845 --> 00:28:23.535
with eating disorders.

417
00:28:26.235 --> 00:28:30.215
Uh, there are people who just don't really feel much at all

418
00:28:30.215 --> 00:28:31.895
because they've kind of numbed out.

419
00:28:34.435 --> 00:28:36.655
And a lot of these are actually kind

420
00:28:36.655 --> 00:28:38.095
of self preservation things,

421
00:28:38.275 --> 00:28:39.775
but some of them go beyond that.

422
00:28:40.795 --> 00:28:44.135
But the basic thing is these are often driven

423
00:28:44.515 --> 00:28:46.735
by unresolved emotions within us,

424
00:28:47.915 --> 00:28:49.575
or they're kept alive by those.

425
00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:57.255
And when we're talking about counseling, we tend to not,

426
00:28:58.915 --> 00:29:01.455
we hope we don't have to spend a lot of time trying

427
00:29:01.475 --> 00:29:03.335
to manage or intervene up here.

428
00:29:03.395 --> 00:29:04.815
We want to go right to this

429
00:29:06.155 --> 00:29:10.935
and help people minister, help minister to

430
00:29:10.935 --> 00:29:13.695
that pain and bring healing to it.

431
00:29:14.405 --> 00:29:17.655
Because if you do bring healing to this pain

432
00:29:18.035 --> 00:29:21.055
or resolve these emotions, well guess what happens

433
00:29:21.115 --> 00:29:22.575
to the, the symptoms

434
00:29:24.355 --> 00:29:26.455
Go away. Hmm? Go

435
00:29:26.455 --> 00:29:27.455
Away. They go away.

436
00:29:27.455 --> 00:29:29.295
Now,

437
00:29:29.325 --> 00:29:31.855
some things are more difficult than others to deal with,

438
00:29:31.955 --> 00:29:35.855
but that's the principle and the potential.

439
00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:38.095
So the antidotes for these

440
00:29:39.835 --> 00:29:40.835
Are medicines.

441
00:29:41.815 --> 00:29:44.085
Joyce likes to call 'em medicine, okay?

442
00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:46.885
That's one of her words that she really likes.

443
00:29:47.425 --> 00:29:52.205
The antidotes for her is comfort, meaning Romans 12,

444
00:29:52.205 --> 00:29:56.605
15, second part, weep with those who weep.

445
00:29:58.145 --> 00:30:00.405
Now, that's kind of illogical to think that

446
00:30:01.025 --> 00:30:02.165
one person weeping

447
00:30:02.165 --> 00:30:04.885
with another person makes the first person feel better.

448
00:30:05.835 --> 00:30:08.735
That's exactly what we're gonna show you in Matthew five,

449
00:30:08.735 --> 00:30:13.325
four, that there is a connection between when one

450
00:30:13.325 --> 00:30:15.005
of you is hurting, hurt with them,

451
00:30:15.905 --> 00:30:20.565
and when you do, it helps heal the hurt.

452
00:30:21.705 --> 00:30:23.765
It doesn't leave them alone with it.

453
00:30:24.145 --> 00:30:27.165
And we've already been told it's not good to be alone.

454
00:30:29.665 --> 00:30:32.485
So, um, that's the antidote for hurt.

455
00:30:33.265 --> 00:30:35.165
Uh, anger has to be released

456
00:30:37.755 --> 00:30:39.605
through a process of forgiveness.

457
00:30:40.065 --> 00:30:44.605
But basically the idea here is if this is angering me, I am

458
00:30:45.125 --> 00:30:49.605
actually letting it go, even though my flesh doesn't want

459
00:30:49.605 --> 00:30:52.485
to, I wanna hang on to it, man.

460
00:30:52.585 --> 00:30:54.485
I'm, I want to get even with that person

461
00:30:54.705 --> 00:30:56.725
or take vengeance on that person,

462
00:30:57.025 --> 00:30:59.125
or, uh, I'm afraid they'll come back

463
00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:01.485
and I need to be angry when they come back.

464
00:31:01.705 --> 00:31:03.805
So I can defend myself, all kinds

465
00:31:03.805 --> 00:31:05.685
of reasons why I might want to hang onto that.

466
00:31:06.185 --> 00:31:07.925
But Bible actually says, Bruce,

467
00:31:07.945 --> 00:31:11.045
unless you want to go around being an angry person the rest

468
00:31:11.045 --> 00:31:14.045
of your life, or having your heart kind of loaded down with

469
00:31:14.045 --> 00:31:16.005
that, let's let go of that.

470
00:31:16.425 --> 00:31:17.765
And that doesn't mean you have

471
00:31:17.765 --> 00:31:19.365
to trust the person who hurts you.

472
00:31:20.195 --> 00:31:23.085
That doesn't mean you have to lay down

473
00:31:23.105 --> 00:31:25.645
and let them take advantage of you in one way or another.

474
00:31:26.065 --> 00:31:28.885
You may have to have some boundaries with

475
00:31:28.885 --> 00:31:30.045
that person out of love.

476
00:31:30.315 --> 00:31:31.315
Yeah,

477
00:31:31.635 --> 00:31:34.605
Fear and anxiety has to be, uh, displaced.

478
00:31:34.685 --> 00:31:38.445
I think I'll write down here, released anger is released,

479
00:31:39.115 --> 00:31:42.285
fear is displaced by

480
00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:46.005
God's perfect love, reassuring love.

481
00:31:47.025 --> 00:31:50.925
And oftentimes what that looks like is not fixing someone's

482
00:31:51.855 --> 00:31:53.805
issue that causes them fear, like a,

483
00:31:55.125 --> 00:31:58.245
a serious medical diagnosis, but walking alongside of them

484
00:31:58.265 --> 00:32:00.885
and letting them have freedom to talk about it

485
00:32:00.905 --> 00:32:02.805
and just saying, you know, if I could,

486
00:32:02.905 --> 00:32:04.045
I'd fix it, that I can't.

487
00:32:04.045 --> 00:32:05.725
But what I can do is I can be with you.

488
00:32:07.895 --> 00:32:10.085
Guilt is confession

489
00:32:13.335 --> 00:32:17.525
where I agree with my guilt,

490
00:32:17.665 --> 00:32:21.085
but it is possible that you are blaming yourself for stuff

491
00:32:21.085 --> 00:32:23.405
that God doesn't call guilt.

492
00:32:26.315 --> 00:32:29.765
Like sometimes people have been led that

493
00:32:29.765 --> 00:32:33.845
because somebody else got upset due to something they said

494
00:32:34.275 --> 00:32:36.525
that they're, that they were wrong to say it.

495
00:32:36.585 --> 00:32:39.445
And sometimes it's possible they didn't say anything wrong,

496
00:32:40.385 --> 00:32:42.525
but the other person filtered it through a lens

497
00:32:42.595 --> 00:32:44.925
that was inaccurate and got angry.

498
00:32:45.945 --> 00:32:48.205
And I would say, well, we ought to have compassion for 'em,

499
00:32:48.205 --> 00:32:50.525
but I don't think it's gonna help for me to confess

500
00:32:50.525 --> 00:32:52.645
that I said something inappropriate if I didn't.

501
00:32:53.155 --> 00:32:55.605
Does that make sense? That's the in

502
00:32:55.605 --> 00:32:57.085
condemnation needs, the truth.

503
00:32:57.585 --> 00:33:01.565
That's based on If you're a believer.

504
00:33:01.705 --> 00:33:04.725
The word says that there is now no condemnation

505
00:33:04.785 --> 00:33:06.205
for those who are in Christ Jesus.

506
00:33:07.225 --> 00:33:10.565
So if I'm feeling condemnation, it's not coming from God,

507
00:33:11.435 --> 00:33:14.565
it's coming from tapes or memories

508
00:33:14.665 --> 00:33:16.485
or other people's accusations.

509
00:33:17.265 --> 00:33:19.445
And I could be truly innocent,

510
00:33:20.385 --> 00:33:23.725
but feeling condemnation,

511
00:33:24.025 --> 00:33:26.045
and that's a residue from the past.

512
00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:30.685
So tonight, we just want to focus on this one

513
00:33:30.745 --> 00:33:34.805
by covering this verse.

514
00:33:35.435 --> 00:33:38.805
Matthew five, four says, blessed

515
00:33:40.265 --> 00:33:45.205
are they who mourn or they shall be comforting.

516
00:33:48.305 --> 00:33:49.725
Now, if we had an extra half hour,

517
00:33:49.965 --> 00:33:53.085
I would actually lead you all to do this in the room

518
00:33:53.275 --> 00:33:54.925
with music playing to kind

519
00:33:54.925 --> 00:33:56.685
of cover your conversations, okay?

520
00:33:56.995 --> 00:33:59.165
Just to try to make it a little bit more private.

521
00:33:59.745 --> 00:34:01.325
But instead, I'm just gonna say,

522
00:34:01.585 --> 00:34:03.325
if you haven't done this one this week,

523
00:34:04.865 --> 00:34:06.765
try doing it tonight before you go to bed.

524
00:34:07.765 --> 00:34:11.265
It, it may only take you 15 minutes for the two of you

525
00:34:11.265 --> 00:34:12.865
to share that, or it could take longer,

526
00:34:13.125 --> 00:34:14.265
and that's great if it does.

527
00:34:14.405 --> 00:34:17.105
But, um, this

528
00:34:17.735 --> 00:34:20.185
word blessed literally means happier.

529
00:34:25.565 --> 00:34:28.095
Happier are they who mourn,

530
00:34:28.945 --> 00:34:31.775
which essentially means they feel sad

531
00:34:32.755 --> 00:34:36.575
or they're grieving or they're hurt.

532
00:34:39.555 --> 00:34:43.015
So this verse is saying, happier are they who feel sad?

533
00:34:43.015 --> 00:34:43.975
Well, if you stopped right

534
00:34:43.975 --> 00:34:45.255
there, it wouldn't make any sense.

535
00:34:45.255 --> 00:34:46.295
It'd be an oxymoron.

536
00:34:47.235 --> 00:34:51.255
But it's because they are comforted,

537
00:34:53.025 --> 00:34:57.495
which means to feel sad for someone

538
00:35:00.795 --> 00:35:04.455
or to feel compassion for them.

539
00:35:07.085 --> 00:35:09.815
It's a movement in my heart that's not rational.

540
00:35:10.165 --> 00:35:14.975
It's relation, it's emotional, such

541
00:35:14.975 --> 00:35:19.935
that if I see somebody who's hurting and I,

542
00:35:21.795 --> 00:35:23.695
and my heart doesn't go to, well,

543
00:35:23.695 --> 00:35:25.255
you probably brought it on yourself,

544
00:35:26.555 --> 00:35:27.935
you know, or things like that.

545
00:35:30.075 --> 00:35:32.055
But I just simply go to compassion.

546
00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:35.055
Like, like the Samaritan

547
00:35:35.075 --> 00:35:37.480
who sees the winded traveler on the side of, of the road,

548
00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.645
it says, his heart was moved with compassion

549
00:35:39.945 --> 00:35:42.845
and that's what motivated him to actually go and help.

550
00:35:45.115 --> 00:35:48.175
So if I'm feeling compassion for,

551
00:35:48.395 --> 00:35:50.575
and with this one who's mourning,

552
00:35:51.605 --> 00:35:55.415
this is the promise that comes out of that.

553
00:35:55.995 --> 00:35:59.655
Now, the word most people use when they share something

554
00:35:59.655 --> 00:36:03.615
with you and you comfort them, you just say,

555
00:36:05.455 --> 00:36:06.535
I can see that you're hurting,

556
00:36:06.555 --> 00:36:07.695
and I want you to know I care.

557
00:36:07.805 --> 00:36:10.015
Tell me what, what, what happened to you?

558
00:36:10.715 --> 00:36:14.895
And when they tell you and you find that you are continuing

559
00:36:14.995 --> 00:36:19.455
to feel sorrow, sadness, compassion

560
00:36:19.635 --> 00:36:23.535
for them, And sometimes you don't even have to use words.

561
00:36:25.415 --> 00:36:26.705
They can see it in your eyes,

562
00:36:27.215 --> 00:36:28.825
they can hear it in your tone of voice.

563
00:36:31.765 --> 00:36:34.385
But if in doubt, just say, I want you to know I care.

564
00:36:36.385 --> 00:36:38.345
I want you to know I care that that happened to you.

565
00:36:42.395 --> 00:36:47.055
And the word they will often use is that as you were doing

566
00:36:47.055 --> 00:36:48.295
that, I was feeling a measure

567
00:36:48.315 --> 00:36:52.135
of relief from the sadness.

568
00:36:53.595 --> 00:36:57.295
And that's totally different than suppressing sadness.

569
00:36:58.515 --> 00:36:59.575
But that really means,

570
00:36:59.715 --> 00:37:01.775
and this has been proven scientifically,

571
00:37:02.515 --> 00:37:05.775
is there are new neuropathways being formed in your brain

572
00:37:05.775 --> 00:37:07.575
when that process is taking place.

573
00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:11.815
Different areas are lighting up, which is saying

574
00:37:13.445 --> 00:37:17.335
that hurtful experience has now been paired up

575
00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:20.415
with a healing experience where someone cared.

576
00:37:23.265 --> 00:37:26.005
You'll find in the scripture that Jesus' emotions

577
00:37:26.005 --> 00:37:29.365
that are most often mentioned is that he felt

578
00:37:30.025 --> 00:37:31.645
or was moved with compassion,

579
00:37:34.865 --> 00:37:36.275
like when Lazarus died.

580
00:37:36.335 --> 00:37:39.915
And he comes and sees Mary and Martha Lazarus sisters

581
00:37:40.415 --> 00:37:43.395
and says he was moved deeply within his, uh,

582
00:37:43.395 --> 00:37:45.395
spirit with compassion.

583
00:37:45.655 --> 00:37:47.715
And that's where it says Jesus wet.

584
00:37:49.775 --> 00:37:52.435
Who is he crying for? He was crying for them.

585
00:37:52.895 --> 00:37:54.955
And when you think about what he could have said,

586
00:37:56.025 --> 00:37:58.515
because if he just said, now ladies,

587
00:37:58.625 --> 00:38:00.035
just hold on a few minutes

588
00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:01.915
because I'm gonna do something

589
00:38:02.185 --> 00:38:03.835
that you're ne you've never seen before,

590
00:38:04.935 --> 00:38:07.355
and yet you met them where were mm-Hmm.

591
00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:12.435
So my encouragement is your homework,

592
00:38:15.255 --> 00:38:17.075
Uh, would be to, and,

593
00:38:17.135 --> 00:38:19.195
and if you've already done an exercise like

594
00:38:19.195 --> 00:38:20.995
this, you probably have more.

595
00:38:21.845 --> 00:38:25.635
We're actually saying if in your brain you've got a whole

596
00:38:25.655 --> 00:38:30.115
lot of memories that have sadness or disappointment

597
00:38:30.215 --> 00:38:32.675
or hurt tied to them even,

598
00:38:32.815 --> 00:38:34.355
and right now I'm talking about ones

599
00:38:34.355 --> 00:38:37.285
that don't involve your spouse, we're talking about other

600
00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:42.445
hurts, then it would be good if every single one

601
00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:43.645
of them was touched upon.

602
00:38:43.745 --> 00:38:46.405
But I think what you'll find is when some are touched upon,

603
00:38:46.515 --> 00:38:49.205
it's as if it's healing more than just that one.

604
00:38:50.385 --> 00:38:54.755
But we're just saying that's God's way of healing it. Okay?

605
00:38:56.075 --> 00:38:58.735
And it's not good to be alone with a bunch of dots.

606
00:39:00.095 --> 00:39:02.175
A bunch of unhealed hurts. Okay?

607
00:39:02.675 --> 00:39:05.855
So one thing we have found is we just periodically will

608
00:39:06.435 --> 00:39:08.335
invite each other, you know, is there something else

609
00:39:08.435 --> 00:39:12.735
that's come up in your thinking recently about other hurts?

610
00:39:13.795 --> 00:39:15.895
And, uh, before we finish the class,

611
00:39:16.025 --> 00:39:19.655
we'll also talk specifically about how do you now care

612
00:39:19.655 --> 00:39:21.255
for the hurts that you've caused each other?

613
00:39:21.715 --> 00:39:24.535
That's real important to deal with. Okay?

614
00:39:25.695 --> 00:39:27.135
Questions or thoughts about that?

615
00:39:30.195 --> 00:39:33.135
Do you hear people say, uh,

616
00:39:34.125 --> 00:39:35.295
this is me just asking.

617
00:39:35.515 --> 00:39:40.095
Mm-Hmm. So you hear the phrase that if someone's hurting,

618
00:39:40.555 --> 00:39:44.215
uh, if you share it with someone, it's half.

619
00:39:44.975 --> 00:39:47.335
I don't believe I actually understood that,

620
00:39:47.445 --> 00:39:48.455
That it cuts it in half.

621
00:39:48.525 --> 00:39:50.015
Yeah, it Cuts the pain head.

622
00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:53.375
Do you, I mean, that's really not, yeah.

623
00:39:53.675 --> 00:39:55.095
Do you believe in that at all?

624
00:39:55.335 --> 00:39:57.335
I mean, it just, it's like they share your,

625
00:39:57.765 --> 00:40:00.535
they carry your burden that you have your burden.

626
00:40:01.045 --> 00:40:02.855
Yeah. Do you believe that any of

627
00:40:02.855 --> 00:40:04.415
that really makes sense? I'm asking,

628
00:40:04.805 --> 00:40:07.215
Well, actually, rose, actually I do,

629
00:40:07.795 --> 00:40:11.015
but I think it's almost a different way of trying to say,

630
00:40:11.195 --> 00:40:13.015
say the same thing, what that verse says,

631
00:40:13.765 --> 00:40:14.935
blessed or happier.

632
00:40:15.475 --> 00:40:18.015
But if they say, well, you've cut your pain in half,

633
00:40:18.045 --> 00:40:20.055
well there's two of you and you're sharing it.

634
00:40:20.795 --> 00:40:23.335
So I think that's probably where that saying comes from.

635
00:40:24.195 --> 00:40:28.655
So I would not, uh, say that's technically right,

636
00:40:29.475 --> 00:40:31.855
but it carries the same basic idea that

637
00:40:33.315 --> 00:40:37.015
we can have tremendous impact on people we don't even know.

638
00:40:38.275 --> 00:40:41.375
If we listen to their story, see that there's something

639
00:40:41.375 --> 00:40:45.145
that's hurting them or has hurt them,

640
00:40:45.845 --> 00:40:48.465
and we express empathy

641
00:40:48.885 --> 00:40:53.065
and compassion, empathy can be, I can see

642
00:40:53.065 --> 00:40:54.985
that you're hurting, or I can see

643
00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:56.265
that was really hard for you.

644
00:40:57.435 --> 00:41:00.785
Compassion is, and I want you to know I care that you had

645
00:41:00.785 --> 00:41:02.985
to go through that or that you did go through that.

646
00:41:04.405 --> 00:41:07.705
And those two statements spoken honestly

647
00:41:09.215 --> 00:41:13.005
carry the benefit

648
00:41:13.545 --> 00:41:14.965
of comforting that person.

649
00:41:16.755 --> 00:41:18.215
Now, what we typically do

650
00:41:19.405 --> 00:41:23.015
sometimes if we're the person who's mourning we might tell

651
00:41:23.015 --> 00:41:27.735
these things to ourself, is we respond with,

652
00:41:28.435 --> 00:41:32.255
uh, facts, logic,

653
00:41:34.865 --> 00:41:38.695
Rationale, saying things like, well, you know,

654
00:41:38.695 --> 00:41:40.055
that happened 30 years ago.

655
00:41:40.335 --> 00:41:44.415
I should be over that by now happened a long time ago.

656
00:41:44.415 --> 00:41:46.335
Well, that part might be totally true,

657
00:41:47.155 --> 00:41:48.855
but that does not heal anything.

658
00:41:49.765 --> 00:41:54.615
Okay? Another person might say, well, worse things happen

659
00:41:54.755 --> 00:41:58.775
to other people, implying you shouldn't let

660
00:41:58.775 --> 00:41:59.855
this bother you that much.

661
00:42:02.315 --> 00:42:04.615
Now, is that a factual statement?

662
00:42:04.885 --> 00:42:08.295
Yeah, I think we can always find somebody who's been

663
00:42:08.295 --> 00:42:09.375
through more than we've been through,

664
00:42:10.885 --> 00:42:13.225
but that is not what God says to do with it.

665
00:42:14.005 --> 00:42:18.145
So we would discourage them from making those kinds of, uh,

666
00:42:19.225 --> 00:42:23.585
comments or even comparisons to themselves

667
00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:26.505
and definitely not to someone else who's hurting.

668
00:42:28.325 --> 00:42:30.465
Uh, some of us were criticized

669
00:42:33.495 --> 00:42:38.235
because we were sad or crying.

670
00:42:40.275 --> 00:42:42.595
Somebody said, well, you're just being too sensitive.

671
00:42:46.475 --> 00:42:50.335
And the thing is, unless they are dramatically

672
00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:54.575
exaggerating their pain, willfully dramatically

673
00:42:55.655 --> 00:42:59.775
exaggerating it, pain is pain, okay?

674
00:42:59.775 --> 00:43:01.775
And if they're feeling sad, they're feeling sad,

675
00:43:02.555 --> 00:43:03.695
and who are we to judge?

676
00:43:03.695 --> 00:43:07.535
Whether they are expressing it too loudly,

677
00:43:08.555 --> 00:43:10.455
I'd say, that's not what I'm called to do.

678
00:43:11.915 --> 00:43:13.175
So we were criticized

679
00:43:13.795 --> 00:43:18.135
and that just puts a layer of condemnation on top of

680
00:43:19.355 --> 00:43:22.695
the criticism, On top of the hurt, rather.

681
00:43:24.675 --> 00:43:29.395
Uh, thirdly, we might, um, find

682
00:43:29.395 --> 00:43:31.875
that when we are sad,

683
00:43:34.495 --> 00:43:38.155
the other person that we're sharing that with says,

684
00:43:38.175 --> 00:43:39.275
you think that's bad?

685
00:43:40.615 --> 00:43:43.035
Let me tell you what happened to me. And they won up us.

686
00:43:43.945 --> 00:43:47.035
Okay? Uh, George

687
00:43:47.035 --> 00:43:49.715
and I, by the way, would both confess, we've done every one

688
00:43:49.715 --> 00:43:52.235
of these things wrong and more often than we'd like

689
00:43:52.235 --> 00:43:53.635
to admit, but once we learned,

690
00:43:53.775 --> 00:43:56.595
it was almost like we caught ourselves a lot of times.

691
00:43:56.735 --> 00:44:01.465
And we catch ourselves doing that, um, pep talks

692
00:44:05.115 --> 00:44:07.935
and, and we can spiritualize pep talks.

693
00:44:07.955 --> 00:44:10.455
We can say, you know, God's on his throne, don't you?

694
00:44:10.865 --> 00:44:13.415
He'll probably make a ministry out

695
00:44:13.415 --> 00:44:14.815
of this pain that you went through.

696
00:44:15.115 --> 00:44:17.095
Now, whether he does or not is up to God,

697
00:44:17.515 --> 00:44:19.815
but that's not his answer to your sadness.

698
00:44:22.275 --> 00:44:23.695
So avoid pep talks.

699
00:44:24.155 --> 00:44:26.655
Uh, sometimes we get pep talks

700
00:44:26.655 --> 00:44:30.095
because we're not comfortable with this person crying.

701
00:44:31.505 --> 00:44:34.285
And then finally, uh, neglect

702
00:44:35.455 --> 00:44:36.605
where nothing is said.

703
00:44:37.945 --> 00:44:39.045
So seeing

704
00:44:39.045 --> 00:44:43.685
that the clock has moved faster than I thought it would, uh,

705
00:44:44.605 --> 00:44:47.005
I know better than to extend unnecessarily.

706
00:44:47.105 --> 00:44:50.845
So what I'm gonna do is just encourage you to

707
00:44:51.995 --> 00:44:53.005
keep practicing.

708
00:44:53.465 --> 00:44:55.245
Not only rejoice for those who rejoice,

709
00:44:55.245 --> 00:44:56.485
but more those who mourn.

710
00:44:57.785 --> 00:45:02.495
Those ought to be lifestyle influences from now on.

711
00:45:03.995 --> 00:45:07.455
And don't miss how powerful they can be with other people

712
00:45:08.885 --> 00:45:12.095
because, 'cause a lot of people are getting pep talks,

713
00:45:13.055 --> 00:45:15.375
spiritual pep talks, rationale

714
00:45:17.005 --> 00:45:19.535
because that's all that some people know to do

715
00:45:20.075 --> 00:45:23.775
and they're trying to help, but it's not very helpful.

716
00:45:25.945 --> 00:45:29.915
Comfort is an issue of the heart, not the rational mind.

717
00:45:31.785 --> 00:45:34.635
When Jesus was moved with compassion,

718
00:45:34.855 --> 00:45:36.235
he didn't preach a sermon,

719
00:45:39.665 --> 00:45:41.005
he offered Kerry wept.

720
00:45:42.915 --> 00:45:44.405
That was very healing for Mary

721
00:45:44.425 --> 00:45:48.605
and Martha, next time,

722
00:45:48.605 --> 00:45:50.125
please hold me accountable for this.

723
00:45:50.425 --> 00:45:53.605
I'm going to show a

724
00:45:55.615 --> 00:45:57.925
video that has to do with

725
00:45:59.085 --> 00:46:01.405
a Jesus who pursues you.

726
00:46:04.265 --> 00:46:05.765
He pursues you with love

727
00:46:06.505 --> 00:46:10.595
and care and support.

728
00:46:13.065 --> 00:46:15.275
Doesn't mean that we have never gone through something

729
00:46:15.275 --> 00:46:16.915
where bad things happen to us.

730
00:46:17.055 --> 00:46:19.195
And we might say, well, where was Jesus?

731
00:46:19.455 --> 00:46:23.515
I'm saying, I don't know, but his word says that

732
00:46:24.305 --> 00:46:27.275
even if it, you still go through some painful things,

733
00:46:28.095 --> 00:46:29.275
he is pursuing you.

734
00:46:29.295 --> 00:46:32.075
And I'll show you an example next week from the scripture

735
00:46:34.455 --> 00:46:37.235
And we'll start with that just as a way of kind

736
00:46:37.235 --> 00:46:41.475
of bringing this, how's Jesus get involved in this with us?

737
00:46:42.385 --> 00:46:44.355
Okay. Questions or thoughts?

738
00:46:46.415 --> 00:46:49.115
So all the recordings, how do we get to them?

739
00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:53.435
Uh, you should have gotten an email with the link

740
00:46:54.455 --> 00:46:55.035
One. You've

741
00:46:55.035 --> 00:46:56.035
Got that. Okay. And so

742
00:46:56.035 --> 00:46:57.075
you just click on that link

743
00:46:57.075 --> 00:46:59.955
and it ought to work if it just

744
00:46:59.955 --> 00:47:01.515
Put the one link? Or is it add?

745
00:47:01.935 --> 00:47:04.395
Uh, we did them for the past two weeks

746
00:47:04.775 --> 00:47:07.555
and this, this one we've got part of it.

747
00:47:08.465 --> 00:47:12.075
Okay. And it's more audible than it is, you know,

748
00:47:12.185 --> 00:47:14.155
it's just looking at that screen right now.

749
00:47:14.615 --> 00:47:17.195
But, um, at least it'll be the audible part of it.

750
00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:21.595
And, uh, I think what I'll do is at least

751
00:47:22.825 --> 00:47:26.915
I'll capture these drawings just so anybody who's looking at

752
00:47:26.915 --> 00:47:28.515
that can tell what we were talking about.

753
00:47:29.435 --> 00:47:31.805
Okay. Alright.

754
00:47:31.835 --> 00:47:34.125
Well thank you all for all of your attention

755
00:47:34.225 --> 00:47:38.165
and participation and, uh, didn't have to twist your arm

756
00:47:38.265 --> 00:47:39.765
to get you to share earlier tonight.

757
00:47:39.875 --> 00:47:43.525
That was good. That's real good. So we'll see you next week.

758
00:47:44.075 --> 00:47:45.205
Okay? You

759
00:47:45.265 --> 00:47:45.485
Bet.
