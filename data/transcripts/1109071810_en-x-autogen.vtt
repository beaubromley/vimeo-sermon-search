00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:02.605
All

2
00:00:03.955 --> 00:00:04.955
Morning.

3
00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:08.445
Good. I'm good. Ready to go? All right.

4
00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:09.845
Good morning everybody. Oh, hey,

5
00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:11.205
you can, you can come shake my hand.

6
00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:13.965
That's cool. Come on, let's do it. Let's do it. That's good.

7
00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:16.285
We got it. Good morning. All right,

8
00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:19.245
you can continue those conversations after we're done today.

9
00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:23.325
Hope you met somebody new and uh, just feel welcome.

10
00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:24.525
If you are new to our church,

11
00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:25.805
we're grateful that you would be here.

12
00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:29.325
We would like to get to know you if we can At some point,

13
00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:31.165
whenever you feel comfortable enough to do that,

14
00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:32.645
you can head to the new area out there

15
00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:33.645
or the QR code in front of you.

16
00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:36.565
We just wanna help you connect to our church, find a place

17
00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:37.685
that you can call home

18
00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:39.165
and really find a community

19
00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:40.405
of people that you can call family.

20
00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.005
And so that's what we wanna help you do.

21
00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.205
Hopefully we can at some point soon for you.

22
00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:47.045
But as you can tell though, today is something special.

23
00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:50.085
We're you celebrating something unique where uh,

24
00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:53.285
it's the end of our series through this summer we've called

25
00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:56.725
realigned and it's been in Romans chapter 12.

26
00:00:56.985 --> 00:00:59.365
As we walk that road, we just have seen God

27
00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:01.045
do an amazing work.

28
00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:03.005
And we've used this illustration the whole time,

29
00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:06.765
this plumb line that we've said Jesus

30
00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:09.525
sets the perfect standard for us.

31
00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:14.445
So from the top down measured that he is, he is showing us

32
00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:16.045
as Romans 12 describes

33
00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:18.605
what the perfect life would look like,

34
00:01:18.675 --> 00:01:22.685
what a transformed life in Christ would look like as

35
00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:25.125
we are transformed by him.

36
00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:28.925
Now, it's been challenging for us every week as we've seen

37
00:01:29.505 --> 00:01:33.565
God push us with his word in Romans 12, all

38
00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:34.965
of these things showing us

39
00:01:35.065 --> 00:01:38.605
how far from this standard we actually are, if we're honest,

40
00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:44.645
plus how we are so prone to want to measure ourselves off

41
00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:46.805
of some other standard, right?

42
00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:49.525
The world's standard or somebody else around us

43
00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:51.965
and we say, man, look, I'm not that far off.

44
00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:55.005
If we're measuring off of that, that's the problem.

45
00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:56.965
We have to flip it around

46
00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:59.685
and measure off of the perfect standard of Christ.

47
00:01:59.865 --> 00:02:04.085
And, and so today what we're gonna see is how

48
00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:07.405
that process of realignment actually occurs.

49
00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:11.085
And we've seen Romans 12 show us what we should be.

50
00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:15.805
Christ is the perfect standard, but how does it happen day

51
00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:19.245
after day for God to pull us back to that standard

52
00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:22.965
to realign us to his image?

53
00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:26.005
Now some of you might have already turned

54
00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.445
to Romans chapter 12 since we have every Sunday this summer.

55
00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.445
That's okay. We'll see it a little bit,

56
00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:34.605
but we actually need for some more focus on this turn

57
00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.925
to second Corinthians chapter three.

58
00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:38.685
So if you're at Romans 12,

59
00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:41.045
you can just turn right a little bit, you'll get

60
00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:42.165
to first Corinthians

61
00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:45.245
and then second Corinthians chapter three,

62
00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.325
that's the big number three.

63
00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:49.565
And we're gonna be in two verses in that verses 17 and 18.

64
00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:52.205
And these will show us again

65
00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:56.565
what this focus on transformation means and

66
00:02:56.565 --> 00:02:57.965
and what, how it happens really

67
00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:01.405
as we get into this idea of christlikeness.

68
00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:07.965
So two Corinthians chapter three verses 17 and 18.

69
00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:09.765
And then we'll come back and

70
00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:10.845
and dig through it a little bit.

71
00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:15.405
Now, the Lord is the Spirit

72
00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:19.165
and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

73
00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:24.405
And we all, with unveiled face beholding the glory

74
00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:29.085
of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from

75
00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:30.885
one degree of glory to another.

76
00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:34.725
For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.

77
00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:39.725
Lord, as we come to your word in this moment, we do pray

78
00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:44.405
that, that we would see this transformation begin

79
00:03:44.665 --> 00:03:48.005
for some people today, that they would be awakened

80
00:03:48.025 --> 00:03:50.125
by your spirit to know and believe,

81
00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:56.665
but for all of us, that we would be taken one step,

82
00:03:57.165 --> 00:04:00.225
one degree further in this transformation process

83
00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:02.185
and then tomorrow and the next day.

84
00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:06.025
And that your spirit, Lord, your spirit in us,

85
00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:09.545
would change us to

86
00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:11.505
where we're different than we were before.

87
00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:14.565
Help us God. We need you to do that.

88
00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:17.125
We can't do that ourselves. This has gotta be your work.

89
00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:19.245
So we give you glory for it

90
00:04:19.245 --> 00:04:22.605
and ask you to do it in Jesus' name.

91
00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:26.685
Amen. So the context

92
00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:28.885
of this passage is similar

93
00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:30.725
to the context we were at in Romans 12,

94
00:04:31.295 --> 00:04:33.685
where the apostle Paul is writing to this local church

95
00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:37.125
and he's explaining the gospel why they need salvation and

96
00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:38.765
and what they do about it, but then also

97
00:04:38.765 --> 00:04:39.845
what it does in their lives.

98
00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:43.885
And so he's both before salvation, why and after and how.

99
00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:46.405
And so he's talking the same kind of way,

100
00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:49.885
but here he uses Moses from the Old Testament

101
00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:51.205
as a case study.

102
00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:54.045
And so he kind of compares the old covenant

103
00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:55.565
with a new covenant

104
00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:58.205
and he explained that this new covenant,

105
00:04:58.515 --> 00:05:00.845
that the oh Moses was under the old covenant,

106
00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:02.685
that the new covenant we are under

107
00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:06.205
actually removes the veil from our hearts so

108
00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:09.885
that we can now understand the Lord, understand his word,

109
00:05:10.145 --> 00:05:13.645
and we can actually in a sense, see his glory

110
00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:16.445
that Moses had to be really careful with.

111
00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:21.165
We can see in a different way by faith we can see God.

112
00:05:23.505 --> 00:05:25.925
And so that's the context of this difference back and forth.

113
00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:27.565
We'll come back to that a little bit more throughout.

114
00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:31.125
But you also saw the Spirit mentioned here

115
00:05:32.055 --> 00:05:34.895
a couple times specifically that the Lord is the spirit

116
00:05:35.915 --> 00:05:37.575
and the spirit gives freedom.

117
00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:41.695
Now this is all referring to the Holy Spirit,

118
00:05:42.435 --> 00:05:45.895
the third person of the Trinity, uh, the three in one God

119
00:05:45.895 --> 00:05:48.135
that we worship different than other religions,

120
00:05:48.135 --> 00:05:52.095
that it's Father Son Spirit co-equal, uh,

121
00:05:52.155 --> 00:05:54.615
but distinct three persons in one essence

122
00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:56.175
that's really hard to understand.

123
00:05:56.195 --> 00:05:59.085
But the Trinity is what we're talking about

124
00:06:00.205 --> 00:06:03.845
specifically the Holy Spirit's role in salvation

125
00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:07.045
is first to secure and seal

126
00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:10.925
and guarantee our eternal inheritance like a down payment

127
00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:12.085
on something you'll get later.

128
00:06:12.345 --> 00:06:14.965
The Holy Spirit is God with us.

129
00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:18.485
So we are assured of God being with us

130
00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.325
and us being with God forever down payment

131
00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:22.965
of something coming.

132
00:06:22.985 --> 00:06:24.805
That's part of the Holy Spirit's role is

133
00:06:24.805 --> 00:06:26.285
to seal our salvation.

134
00:06:26.545 --> 00:06:30.525
But also Galatians four, six says, the Holy Spirit fills us

135
00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:33.125
whenever we are adopted into God's family.

136
00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:36.405
So not only seals us, surrounds us,

137
00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:40.045
but also fills us who believe it.

138
00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:41.965
That that means listen, if you're a Christian,

139
00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:45.405
if you've said Jesus, you are my Lord

140
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.925
and Savior, I believe that means the Holy Spirit,

141
00:06:48.055 --> 00:06:49.085
God's spirit, third person,

142
00:06:49.085 --> 00:06:53.125
the trinity has filled your soul, filled you up.

143
00:06:53.205 --> 00:06:54.965
I know it's hard to understand because it's

144
00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:56.045
a spiritual thing.

145
00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:58.765
God himself lives within you

146
00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:03.725
and all that God is has is flowing in you and through you.

147
00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:08.245
And second Corinthians three says, he is the mechanism

148
00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:10.365
for our sanctification.

149
00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:13.005
Uh, sanctification is a big word

150
00:07:13.005 --> 00:07:15.365
that means growth in christlikeness,

151
00:07:15.365 --> 00:07:16.565
that you become more like Jesus.

152
00:07:16.585 --> 00:07:19.725
You're growing in holiness. That's what that means.

153
00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:24.725
So the Holy Spirit planted in you is how you are sanctified.

154
00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:27.315
This is not a new concept.

155
00:07:27.455 --> 00:07:29.595
We saw this back at the beginning of Romans 12,

156
00:07:30.025 --> 00:07:32.475
just a few months ago when we started the series.

157
00:07:33.655 --> 00:07:35.995
Listen to verses one and two again. Remember this?

158
00:07:36.095 --> 00:07:37.435
He said, I appeal to you,

159
00:07:37.435 --> 00:07:40.035
therefore brothers, by the mercies of God

160
00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:43.515
to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy

161
00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:46.075
and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.

162
00:07:46.935 --> 00:07:50.715
But then listen to this. Do not be conformed to the world,

163
00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:55.355
but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.

164
00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.435
That by testing may discern what is the will of God,

165
00:07:58.505 --> 00:08:00.155
what is good and acceptable and perfect.

166
00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:04.435
So remember the structure of this whole series.

167
00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:06.835
We jumped in at Romans 12.

168
00:08:07.015 --> 00:08:09.115
We had to kind of talk about Romans one through 11.

169
00:08:09.165 --> 00:08:12.235
First Romans one through 11 is Paul explaining

170
00:08:12.815 --> 00:08:14.355
why you need to be saved.

171
00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:19.155
Like this is a problem sin, you can't fix it.

172
00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:21.675
You can't do anything about it. God did everything for it.

173
00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:24.395
You believe in God, he redeems you, he changes you,

174
00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:25.715
makes you new, all of those things.

175
00:08:25.915 --> 00:08:30.275
That's Romans one through 11 and then Romans 12,

176
00:08:30.585 --> 00:08:33.195
therefore that first word, therefore

177
00:08:33.195 --> 00:08:35.555
because of what God has done, all

178
00:08:35.555 --> 00:08:36.795
of his mercy and grace to you.

179
00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.675
Therefore, Romans 12 begins to talk about

180
00:08:40.675 --> 00:08:44.835
what the new life looks like, the new life he's purchased

181
00:08:44.855 --> 00:08:47.555
for you and given you, made you born again.

182
00:08:47.815 --> 00:08:50.755
Here's now 12 through 16 what it actually looks like

183
00:08:52.575 --> 00:08:55.605
in the Holy Spirit's power to transform you

184
00:08:55.635 --> 00:08:57.365
because he's given this to you.

185
00:08:57.665 --> 00:09:00.645
You now have the opportunity to live out

186
00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:02.045
what he's called you to.

187
00:09:03.755 --> 00:09:04.775
He changes you into that.

188
00:09:04.775 --> 00:09:07.055
That leads us right back to Second Corinthians three,

189
00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:13.095
which shows us how God's spirit actually does that.

190
00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:17.875
So we're gonna pick out three simple points from these

191
00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:20.395
couple verses of how the Holy Spirit does this.

192
00:09:22.115 --> 00:09:24.105
First, it's that the Holy Spirit gives freedom

193
00:09:24.645 --> 00:09:26.385
for transformation.

194
00:09:27.965 --> 00:09:29.465
The first thing we see in these passages,

195
00:09:30.045 --> 00:09:35.025
the Holy Spirit gives freedom for the transformation

196
00:09:35.025 --> 00:09:37.305
that he says here in the text.

197
00:09:39.215 --> 00:09:41.235
And it's pretty obvious, we saw it in verse 17,

198
00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:45.635
where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom,

199
00:09:47.115 --> 00:09:48.445
like so there's, it's a guarantee.

200
00:09:48.545 --> 00:09:49.645
The spirit of the Lord is there.

201
00:09:49.835 --> 00:09:52.085
There's freedom there at that location.

202
00:09:52.445 --> 00:09:54.765
Wherever the spirit of Lord is, there is freedom.

203
00:09:55.385 --> 00:09:57.925
And then he talks about transformation after that.

204
00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:00.635
Now here's the thing for us in America,

205
00:10:01.865 --> 00:10:05.915
when we hear the word freedom, we tend to think of man,

206
00:10:05.915 --> 00:10:07.315
that means I can do whatever I want, right?

207
00:10:07.845 --> 00:10:10.755
We've got this, this document that says we can have freedom

208
00:10:10.775 --> 00:10:13.115
of religion, freedom of press, freedom

209
00:10:13.255 --> 00:10:14.355
to say what we need to say.

210
00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:16.315
All of those things we, we are free to do

211
00:10:16.505 --> 00:10:18.075
what we want to do.

212
00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:19.635
But the problem with that is

213
00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:20.915
that's not the way the Bible talks

214
00:10:20.915 --> 00:10:22.035
about freedom in this context.

215
00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:27.235
This is not freedom from God's demands.

216
00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:31.065
This is freedom to become

217
00:10:31.685 --> 00:10:33.545
all he's created you to be.

218
00:10:35.905 --> 00:10:37.285
So here, here's the picture of this.

219
00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:40.325
You go back to Romans 12, two,

220
00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:44.365
we are freed from the conformity to this world.

221
00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:47.325
We don't have to be conformed to the world anymore.

222
00:10:47.385 --> 00:10:49.485
That's the sin nature. That's what we had to do.

223
00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:51.165
We don't have to be that anymore.

224
00:10:51.295 --> 00:10:54.765
We're freed from that to be transformed

225
00:10:55.385 --> 00:10:56.685
by the work of God in our lives.

226
00:10:57.595 --> 00:11:02.455
That's the freedom. The freedom we have is that we are dead

227
00:11:02.475 --> 00:11:04.415
to sin and we're alive to God.

228
00:11:04.475 --> 00:11:07.725
Now that we couldn't not sin, we had to do that.

229
00:11:08.025 --> 00:11:10.325
Now we can do what God's called.

230
00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:11.645
We can live a different life.

231
00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:16.365
That's the freedom, not freedom to do whatever we want.

232
00:11:18.225 --> 00:11:19.565
The veil has been lifted.

233
00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:22.325
That spiritual blindness that we had has been gone.

234
00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:25.605
The bondage of self-centered living has been shattered.

235
00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:27.205
We don't have to live like that anymore.

236
00:11:27.345 --> 00:11:28.885
We can live a new life.

237
00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:31.965
That's the freedom that he's talking about here,

238
00:11:31.965 --> 00:11:34.245
where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom.

239
00:11:36.925 --> 00:11:38.265
Now, you might be sitting there saying, well,

240
00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.065
I feel like I'm free right now.

241
00:11:41.475 --> 00:11:42.865
Maybe you're not a believer and you're like,

242
00:11:42.865 --> 00:11:43.945
oh, I've been, I can do whatever I want.

243
00:11:43.965 --> 00:11:46.425
I'm free. Now, we've said this nearly every week.

244
00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:50.785
The Bible talks about us in such a way that every one

245
00:11:50.785 --> 00:11:53.405
of us are born slaves to sin,

246
00:11:55.155 --> 00:11:56.565
that we can do nothing but that.

247
00:11:57.525 --> 00:12:01.385
And the whole orientation of our lives from birth is self,

248
00:12:01.815 --> 00:12:03.305
self, self, self.

249
00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:06.105
Get what I want, get what I want, do something kind

250
00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:07.345
so I can get something out of it.

251
00:12:07.345 --> 00:12:08.825
Like all of that is self.

252
00:12:09.175 --> 00:12:13.345
It's the way all of all of us are oriented from birth

253
00:12:13.345 --> 00:12:15.425
because of the sin nature.

254
00:12:15.885 --> 00:12:18.065
And so looking at something like Romans 12,

255
00:12:18.065 --> 00:12:19.905
what we've done all summer, looking at that,

256
00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:22.105
you look at the self-sacrificial lifestyle

257
00:12:22.365 --> 00:12:25.185
and there is no way we could do that on our own

258
00:12:26.775 --> 00:12:28.075
little hints here and there.

259
00:12:28.075 --> 00:12:31.795
There's no way we could live out Romans 12 just by virtue

260
00:12:31.895 --> 00:12:34.795
of us pulling up our bootstraps and going for it.

261
00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:37.035
We can do this. No, there's no way.

262
00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:39.735
'cause our whole heart is self.

263
00:12:43.495 --> 00:12:48.115
Yet when the spirit awakens our hearts

264
00:12:49.995 --> 00:12:53.665
frees us from the chains of self-centered living.

265
00:12:56.245 --> 00:13:00.455
Then we are able dead to sin alive to God.

266
00:13:00.515 --> 00:13:04.215
We are able to live a life of joyful surrender

267
00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:07.805
to the Lord now that we couldn't do before.

268
00:13:07.985 --> 00:13:11.325
We actually were rebelling and opposed to God in our sin.

269
00:13:11.465 --> 00:13:15.085
And now we're free to live a life of joyful surrender.

270
00:13:15.305 --> 00:13:18.805
The veil's been lifted, we can see God's glory in a way

271
00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:21.645
and that should compel us to live a life then

272
00:13:21.645 --> 00:13:22.845
that honors that glory.

273
00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:25.745
We'll talk a lot more about that later.

274
00:13:27.315 --> 00:13:28.895
And so lemme just talk to you if you are a believer

275
00:13:28.915 --> 00:13:31.575
for a second, lemme just say this very clearly.

276
00:13:33.595 --> 00:13:35.455
If you've confessed Christ as your Lord and Savior

277
00:13:35.475 --> 00:13:37.975
and the Holy Spirit and dwells within you as a result of

278
00:13:37.975 --> 00:13:42.575
that belief, if right now you feel like you are trapped in a

279
00:13:42.635 --> 00:13:46.135
sin and you feel like there's no way out,

280
00:13:46.135 --> 00:13:47.295
there's nothing you can do to

281
00:13:47.295 --> 00:13:48.455
fix this, you just have to sin.

282
00:13:48.455 --> 00:13:50.255
It's where you were born this way, right? And I just can't.

283
00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:52.735
I can't not sin. If you are a believer,

284
00:13:53.235 --> 00:13:55.215
you are wrong in believing that

285
00:14:00.845 --> 00:14:03.425
if where the spirit of the Lord is, there's freedom

286
00:14:05.725 --> 00:14:07.185
and you feel like you're trapped

287
00:14:07.325 --> 00:14:08.985
by a sin believer, you're wrong.

288
00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:14.515
There's freedom for those who are in Christ.

289
00:14:16.845 --> 00:14:19.455
It's a failure to, if you stay in there, it's a failure

290
00:14:19.555 --> 00:14:23.015
to understand the explosive power of the gospel.

291
00:14:24.605 --> 00:14:27.215
That second Corinthians five says, if you are in Christ,

292
00:14:27.275 --> 00:14:28.495
you are a new creation.

293
00:14:28.755 --> 00:14:30.935
The old has gone. The new has come.

294
00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:34.455
Now the old still tries to hang on and tries to come back,

295
00:14:34.595 --> 00:14:35.895
but the old is dead.

296
00:14:35.995 --> 00:14:37.375
It has no more power over you.

297
00:14:37.675 --> 00:14:42.295
The new has come again, you're not perfect right away.

298
00:14:42.295 --> 00:14:44.215
You still have to battle stuff to work and fight.

299
00:14:44.215 --> 00:14:45.295
We'll see that again in a moment.

300
00:14:45.555 --> 00:14:49.655
But you have been freed to live a different life than

301
00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:51.015
what you had before You.

302
00:14:51.085 --> 00:14:55.625
You believed like you're, you're free now

303
00:14:55.885 --> 00:14:57.785
to not have to live that life anymore.

304
00:14:57.965 --> 00:14:59.425
You're free to live a new life.

305
00:14:59.575 --> 00:15:01.465
Then again, some of you can't remember

306
00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:03.465
'cause you were like six when you came to faith.

307
00:15:03.725 --> 00:15:05.545
The still right before you were six,

308
00:15:05.725 --> 00:15:06.545
you didn't like your brother

309
00:15:06.545 --> 00:15:07.785
very much, and so you heard him, right?

310
00:15:07.785 --> 00:15:09.265
Well, now you don't have to do that anymore,

311
00:15:09.335 --> 00:15:11.105
even when you don't like him very much

312
00:15:13.785 --> 00:15:15.205
or you came to faith as an adult

313
00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:17.765
and you see this radical transformation of

314
00:15:17.765 --> 00:15:18.765
what you were doing.

315
00:15:19.225 --> 00:15:21.485
God changed new life completely born

316
00:15:21.485 --> 00:15:22.885
again and everything's different.

317
00:15:22.985 --> 00:15:25.605
You can see that very clearly. Either way.

318
00:15:27.295 --> 00:15:28.595
Either way, it's a new life.

319
00:15:29.415 --> 00:15:30.835
The old has gone, the new has come.

320
00:15:30.855 --> 00:15:33.875
And that means you can live differently.

321
00:15:36.205 --> 00:15:38.315
Maybe think about it this way, here's an illustration.

322
00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:41.835
Imagine you were wrapped up in chains.

323
00:15:43.715 --> 00:15:45.775
You're enslaved to something,

324
00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:50.615
yet someone you didn't know couldn't have access to,

325
00:15:51.015 --> 00:15:54.175
walked up, purchased your freedom, redeemed you

326
00:15:54.475 --> 00:15:55.935
and cut those chains.

327
00:15:58.355 --> 00:16:00.255
Man, how joy filled would you be?

328
00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:02.495
Be overwhelmed or excited about that.

329
00:16:04.905 --> 00:16:06.565
But what if you just sat there

330
00:16:07.455 --> 00:16:09.005
still wrapped up in the chains?

331
00:16:12.395 --> 00:16:13.895
You can see that they're cut.

332
00:16:13.955 --> 00:16:15.255
You can see that they're broken,

333
00:16:16.155 --> 00:16:18.975
yet you just still sit there wrapped up in the chains.

334
00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:20.535
They have no more power over you.

335
00:16:20.715 --> 00:16:25.035
But there you sit pretty silly, right?

336
00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:30.025
Yet that's what you and I do every single day.

337
00:16:33.995 --> 00:16:37.615
The the freedom, the where the spirit of the Lord is.

338
00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:42.245
There is freedom. If the spirit of the Lord dwells in you,

339
00:16:42.485 --> 00:16:44.805
believer there's freedom, the chains have been broken,

340
00:16:45.065 --> 00:16:48.005
you don't have to sit there wrapped up in the chains

341
00:16:48.005 --> 00:16:50.605
anymore, that once held you enslaved to sin.

342
00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:52.965
You are not enslaved any more.

343
00:16:54.145 --> 00:16:56.965
You can walk in the transformation

344
00:16:57.235 --> 00:16:59.725
that God has purchased for you.

345
00:17:01.385 --> 00:17:06.345
It's possible. But as I said

346
00:17:06.345 --> 00:17:08.585
before, that growth

347
00:17:08.725 --> 00:17:13.065
and change will not most likely be instantaneous.

348
00:17:15.965 --> 00:17:16.985
That's the second point.

349
00:17:16.985 --> 00:17:19.345
Today, the Holy Spirit produces

350
00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:22.345
progressive transformation.

351
00:17:25.075 --> 00:17:26.565
Most likely won't be instantaneous.

352
00:17:28.385 --> 00:17:32.235
But what the Holy Spirit does as he brings freedom

353
00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:37.835
also produces progressive transformation in your life.

354
00:17:41.275 --> 00:17:43.005
This goes back to two Corinthians three.

355
00:17:43.005 --> 00:17:45.205
Look again at verse 18. See what it says.

356
00:17:45.275 --> 00:17:50.195
It's very clear We all

357
00:17:50.785 --> 00:17:54.435
with unveiled face, behold the glory of the Lord

358
00:17:55.255 --> 00:17:59.595
are being transformed into the same image from one degree

359
00:17:59.655 --> 00:18:01.475
of glory to another.

360
00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.845
Now, I wanna work through that verse just piece by piece

361
00:18:05.845 --> 00:18:08.765
because I, it has so much to teach us about this idea

362
00:18:08.765 --> 00:18:10.005
of transformation.

363
00:18:11.305 --> 00:18:13.085
And what I want you to see first is the goal.

364
00:18:13.705 --> 00:18:15.845
What's the goal of this transformation?

365
00:18:16.755 --> 00:18:19.725
It's that we, each of us who are believers, that we

366
00:18:20.555 --> 00:18:24.845
reflect eventually perfectly reflect the image

367
00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:26.325
of the glory of God.

368
00:18:28.325 --> 00:18:29.385
Now, what even is that?

369
00:18:30.045 --> 00:18:31.705
What's the image of the glory of God?

370
00:18:31.705 --> 00:18:35.225
Well, Colossians one 15, Jesus is the perfect image of God.

371
00:18:35.325 --> 00:18:39.265
And so the glory of God revealed to us is Jesus

372
00:18:41.035 --> 00:18:43.065
glory come, the glory's been revealed.

373
00:18:43.135 --> 00:18:46.225
It's Jesus God the Son taking on flesh.

374
00:18:46.775 --> 00:18:50.705
That is the image that we will eventually reflect,

375
00:18:51.835 --> 00:18:53.645
that God's glory shows up.

376
00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:56.685
It's the same thing. Romans 8 29 says, those whom God

377
00:18:56.825 --> 00:19:01.085
for knew he also predestined to be conformed to the image

378
00:19:01.145 --> 00:19:02.165
of his son.

379
00:19:04.395 --> 00:19:06.845
That is the believer's destiny

380
00:19:08.345 --> 00:19:11.165
to be conformed to the image of his son.

381
00:19:11.165 --> 00:19:13.205
That's why we've used this as the illustration

382
00:19:13.545 --> 00:19:14.965
for this whole realigned series.

383
00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:19.825
He's the standard. What God is doing in us is

384
00:19:19.955 --> 00:19:23.985
realigning us, conforming us to the image of his son.

385
00:19:24.925 --> 00:19:27.785
Romans 12 shows us what that looks like day to day.

386
00:19:27.815 --> 00:19:29.665
That if Jesus was living your life,

387
00:19:29.885 --> 00:19:30.945
that's what it would look like.

388
00:19:33.035 --> 00:19:37.765
It's perfect. That's what he is bringing us to as well.

389
00:19:39.815 --> 00:19:42.195
But notice the next words there in verse 18.

390
00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:47.035
It says, we are being transformed

391
00:19:49.645 --> 00:19:52.675
first since we're about to get back to school, right?

392
00:19:53.145 --> 00:19:54.995
Grammar lesson that's passive.

393
00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:59.395
We are being transformed. This is God's work.

394
00:19:59.395 --> 00:20:00.715
That is even what the verse said.

395
00:20:00.905 --> 00:20:03.235
This comes from the Lord who is the spirit.

396
00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:05.995
This is God's work in us.

397
00:20:06.055 --> 00:20:08.635
Now we offer ourselves living sacrifices,

398
00:20:08.635 --> 00:20:12.515
but God is the one who does the transforming in our souls.

399
00:20:14.035 --> 00:20:15.335
So it's God's work.

400
00:20:15.395 --> 00:20:16.615
We are being transformed,

401
00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:18.535
but also it's a continuous process.

402
00:20:18.805 --> 00:20:21.735
It's an ongoing transformation.

403
00:20:21.955 --> 00:20:25.255
It says we are being transformed.

404
00:20:25.865 --> 00:20:29.135
Being is an ongoing word. It's not a one time event.

405
00:20:30.075 --> 00:20:31.095
You don't come to Christ.

406
00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:33.575
I know it's maybe discouraging to some of you,

407
00:20:33.795 --> 00:20:35.815
but like you come to Christ, you at camp

408
00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:38.255
or at a church service or at home with your mom like,

409
00:20:38.255 --> 00:20:40.295
and you, you came to Christ and you thought everything would

410
00:20:40.295 --> 00:20:41.455
be perfect and it wasn't.

411
00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:43.895
You still struggled with the same stuff

412
00:20:43.895 --> 00:20:45.975
yesterday, tomorrow, every day, right?

413
00:20:45.975 --> 00:20:47.205
Like you still like, I thought

414
00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:48.245
this would be over with by now.

415
00:20:48.425 --> 00:20:52.245
No, it's not an immediate instantaneous transformation.

416
00:20:52.315 --> 00:20:55.085
It's a continual work of grace.

417
00:20:57.135 --> 00:21:00.635
One of my favorite verses Philippians one, six, he who began

418
00:21:01.235 --> 00:21:05.235
a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day

419
00:21:05.395 --> 00:21:07.095
of Jesus Christ, right?

420
00:21:07.095 --> 00:21:09.015
That's a process. He started

421
00:21:09.015 --> 00:21:10.535
something, he's gonna finish that.

422
00:21:10.605 --> 00:21:12.255
Well, there's a process to get there.

423
00:21:13.425 --> 00:21:14.645
That's what he's doing in you.

424
00:21:14.715 --> 00:21:17.525
It's what he's doing in us day after day.

425
00:21:17.545 --> 00:21:19.965
So it's progressive. It's a process.

426
00:21:20.305 --> 00:21:21.765
But there's also another phrase.

427
00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:25.125
It says, one degree of glory to another.

428
00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:29.885
That's the steps. It's another idea of process of growth.

429
00:21:29.995 --> 00:21:33.485
It's progressive. It's even slow, but it's one degree.

430
00:21:33.985 --> 00:21:36.565
One degree, one degree. It's one step at a time.

431
00:21:36.675 --> 00:21:38.965
It's like if you're gonna refine gold,

432
00:21:39.385 --> 00:21:40.685
if you're gonna purify gold,

433
00:21:40.685 --> 00:21:43.165
it's not perfectly refine when it comes outta the ground.

434
00:21:43.585 --> 00:21:45.525
You have to put it in a furnace.

435
00:21:45.785 --> 00:21:47.725
You have to heat it up one degree

436
00:21:47.935 --> 00:21:50.965
after one degree, one degree more, one degree more.

437
00:21:51.065 --> 00:21:53.125
The more you do, the more dross comes off,

438
00:21:53.305 --> 00:21:54.765
the more the bad stuff comes out.

439
00:21:54.985 --> 00:21:57.045
One degree more, more bad stuff comes out.

440
00:21:57.045 --> 00:21:57.925
That's what he's talking about.

441
00:21:58.515 --> 00:21:59.765
He's saying, you're the gold.

442
00:22:00.025 --> 00:22:04.405
You're being refined one degree of glory to the next

443
00:22:05.195 --> 00:22:06.605
over and over and over again,

444
00:22:10.135 --> 00:22:11.505
refined into the image

445
00:22:11.565 --> 00:22:14.465
of Christ as you go through your life.

446
00:22:15.965 --> 00:22:17.665
But then notice there's one more piece of this.

447
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:23.335
How this transformation happens is by

448
00:22:24.085 --> 00:22:26.175
beholding the glory of the Lord.

449
00:22:26.275 --> 00:22:30.175
You see that beholding the glory of the Lord is

450
00:22:30.235 --> 00:22:31.295
how it happens.

451
00:22:33.115 --> 00:22:37.935
Now, if you know your Old Testament, you know

452
00:22:37.935 --> 00:22:39.895
that that was something that they were afraid of

453
00:22:39.895 --> 00:22:42.495
because they would die, right?

454
00:22:42.635 --> 00:22:45.575
Isaiah six, he, he gets a vision of the glory of God

455
00:22:45.575 --> 00:22:46.575
and he's like, I'm gonna die.

456
00:22:46.775 --> 00:22:49.455
Woe is me. I'm on my face. I'm about getting me outta here.

457
00:22:49.525 --> 00:22:53.055
That kind of thing. So what does this mean?

458
00:22:53.675 --> 00:22:54.855
Behold the glory of the Lord.

459
00:22:55.355 --> 00:22:56.375
We should be scared of that, right?

460
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.935
Like if we saw the glory of God, we would die.

461
00:22:58.035 --> 00:23:00.175
So what's he saying?

462
00:23:03.025 --> 00:23:05.515
Well, how we see the glory of God today

463
00:23:07.325 --> 00:23:09.195
since we don't see the vision of God,

464
00:23:09.195 --> 00:23:10.995
we're not seeing Jesus walk around all the time.

465
00:23:11.055 --> 00:23:14.115
So what is the, the glory of God for us? What do we see it?

466
00:23:14.115 --> 00:23:16.595
How do we behold the glory of the Lord today?

467
00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:20.595
Well, first and foremost, it's through God's word.

468
00:23:23.015 --> 00:23:24.075
It is through God's word.

469
00:23:25.725 --> 00:23:30.205
What you hold in your hand is God's revelation

470
00:23:30.345 --> 00:23:34.825
of himself to his people, right?

471
00:23:34.895 --> 00:23:37.625
This is, he's told us what he's like.

472
00:23:37.895 --> 00:23:40.985
He's told us who he is. He told us his character.

473
00:23:41.175 --> 00:23:42.305
He's told us his nature.

474
00:23:42.365 --> 00:23:46.245
He said, this is revealing the glory of the Lord.

475
00:23:46.435 --> 00:23:48.125
This is how you, you see it,

476
00:23:51.035 --> 00:23:54.895
and this is the primary mechanism the spirit uses

477
00:23:55.155 --> 00:23:57.335
to shape your life, right?

478
00:23:57.335 --> 00:24:00.575
Ephesians six calls it the sword of the Spirit.

479
00:24:01.845 --> 00:24:04.175
Well, I love how Hebrews four plays off of that.

480
00:24:04.545 --> 00:24:07.335
Verse 12 says, the word of God is living

481
00:24:07.395 --> 00:24:10.975
and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing

482
00:24:10.995 --> 00:24:13.895
to the division of soul and of spirit, joints

483
00:24:13.895 --> 00:24:15.935
and marrow, discerning the thoughts

484
00:24:16.115 --> 00:24:17.695
and intentions of the heart.

485
00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:22.265
Here's what happens for me sometimes,

486
00:24:22.915 --> 00:24:24.145
maybe this happens for you.

487
00:24:25.835 --> 00:24:28.215
You can go through life. You kinda look at your day

488
00:24:29.555 --> 00:24:30.895
and you think, man, I'm doing pretty good.

489
00:24:32.275 --> 00:24:35.015
I'm not cussing anybody out. I'm not lying.

490
00:24:35.155 --> 00:24:37.895
I'm not stealing stuff like I I didn't hurt anybody today.

491
00:24:38.115 --> 00:24:39.855
I'm, I'm doing pretty good.

492
00:24:42.865 --> 00:24:46.675
Well, the problem is what the Bible does is, is it

493
00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:49.995
pierces to notice what it said, the thoughts

494
00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:52.035
and intentions of the heart.

495
00:24:53.775 --> 00:24:55.635
And that's when it starts to get painful, right?

496
00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:58.195
It's like you can live all the actions out,

497
00:24:58.195 --> 00:24:59.715
you can do all the right things, you can do everything

498
00:24:59.715 --> 00:25:02.675
right, but then it reveals the fact

499
00:25:02.675 --> 00:25:04.275
that you've been actually doing those things,

500
00:25:04.345 --> 00:25:06.955
selfishly doing those things to manipulate somebody else.

501
00:25:07.255 --> 00:25:10.195
And that's where it starts to get into the fact

502
00:25:10.225 --> 00:25:11.475
that you are not as holy.

503
00:25:11.795 --> 00:25:13.555
I am not as holy as I thought I was.

504
00:25:15.935 --> 00:25:20.475
The sword has cut deep into my soul, revealing,

505
00:25:20.915 --> 00:25:25.755
exposing where I am actually not

506
00:25:25.775 --> 00:25:27.795
as close to aligned as I thought I was.

507
00:25:29.585 --> 00:25:33.565
That's the spirit working in your life through the word.

508
00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:38.075
And so hear me, if you are not in

509
00:25:38.725 --> 00:25:40.835
God's word for yourself,

510
00:25:42.215 --> 00:25:45.185
like if you're not digging into it regularly, daily, moment

511
00:25:45.245 --> 00:25:48.145
by moment, like just however you can getting into it

512
00:25:48.325 --> 00:25:52.065
to allow you to see behold the glory of the Lord,

513
00:25:52.125 --> 00:25:54.985
and allow the spirit to change you through that, listen,

514
00:25:55.005 --> 00:25:58.145
you're not going to change as much as you hope you would.

515
00:26:00.675 --> 00:26:04.705
This is how he does it. First

516
00:26:04.725 --> 00:26:06.745
and foremost, he uses this.

517
00:26:07.125 --> 00:26:08.865
Now, you come on Sundays in here

518
00:26:09.005 --> 00:26:11.825
and we do our best to exalt the glory of God

519
00:26:11.825 --> 00:26:15.265
and we try to hope you, you see the glory of God through

520
00:26:15.265 --> 00:26:20.155
what we do here, but it will not be enough compared

521
00:26:20.155 --> 00:26:23.875
to the daily pull of the world and of your own flesh.

522
00:26:24.335 --> 00:26:27.515
You've got to fight with the armor of God, the sword

523
00:26:27.515 --> 00:26:32.275
of the spirit that he has given us to say, behold the glory

524
00:26:32.275 --> 00:26:35.965
of the Lord be changed every day.

525
00:26:37.135 --> 00:26:41.435
So that's the first way. But here's what else he uses.

526
00:26:43.215 --> 00:26:44.275
He uses other people.

527
00:26:46.115 --> 00:26:48.495
He uses other people to refine us

528
00:26:50.045 --> 00:26:51.415
into his image.

529
00:26:51.715 --> 00:26:53.055
We saw that in Romans 12, right?

530
00:26:53.055 --> 00:26:55.375
We saw that, that this, this serving others

531
00:26:55.435 --> 00:26:57.615
who aren't like you, it reveals God's

532
00:26:57.615 --> 00:26:59.535
glory in, in unique ways.

533
00:26:59.555 --> 00:27:01.375
And we a couple ways. First with brothers

534
00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:05.495
and sisters in the church, like as you love them genuinely,

535
00:27:05.675 --> 00:27:07.975
as you honor them, as you pray for them,

536
00:27:08.315 --> 00:27:09.895
you see God more clearly.

537
00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:11.375
You reveal God back

538
00:27:11.375 --> 00:27:13.295
and forth that you, that man, I've,

539
00:27:13.445 --> 00:27:16.535
I've seen it in a hospital room where you're struggling

540
00:27:16.535 --> 00:27:18.935
to see the glory of God and somebody encourages you,

541
00:27:18.935 --> 00:27:22.055
points you to them point, points you to the glory of God

542
00:27:22.055 --> 00:27:23.295
that you never would've seen it.

543
00:27:23.885 --> 00:27:25.425
And you need encouragement. You need a reminder.

544
00:27:25.645 --> 00:27:27.745
You see the glory of God through each other.

545
00:27:30.505 --> 00:27:31.635
There's also another way.

546
00:27:33.315 --> 00:27:36.615
You've heard us talk a couple times today already about, um,

547
00:27:37.115 --> 00:27:38.415
the need in kids' ministry.

548
00:27:40.715 --> 00:27:44.435
And it will be, hear me, it will be a sacrifice.

549
00:27:45.545 --> 00:27:47.365
It will be challenging.

550
00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:50.405
Your con, your comfort, maybe a little,

551
00:27:50.405 --> 00:27:53.565
your convenience on Sundays for you to step into

552
00:27:53.565 --> 00:27:55.445
that world and serve.

553
00:27:57.035 --> 00:28:00.415
But when you look at Romans 12, three through eight, right

554
00:28:00.415 --> 00:28:02.655
after, I'm gonna offer myself as living sacrifice,

555
00:28:02.835 --> 00:28:05.095
verses three through eight are about serving the church.

556
00:28:06.655 --> 00:28:07.995
And they're the biggest chunk of

557
00:28:07.995 --> 00:28:09.435
that whole section in chapter 12.

558
00:28:12.785 --> 00:28:16.305
And you know what happens, like when you step into serving,

559
00:28:17.265 --> 00:28:19.895
especially in a way like that, that God's blessed us

560
00:28:19.895 --> 00:28:21.175
with all these new families coming

561
00:28:21.175 --> 00:28:24.175
and we don't have enough people to, to manage the chaos

562
00:28:24.395 --> 00:28:27.415
of having many, many rooms that we didn't plan for, right?

563
00:28:27.475 --> 00:28:28.775
We just see that happening.

564
00:28:28.865 --> 00:28:31.335
God's bringing more great problem.

565
00:28:33.185 --> 00:28:34.725
But when you step into a world like that

566
00:28:34.725 --> 00:28:38.065
and you serve, yeah, it'll impact those kids.

567
00:28:38.065 --> 00:28:40.955
You heard Everly talk about that. But it changes

568
00:28:41.175 --> 00:28:42.395
you more than anybody else.

569
00:28:43.935 --> 00:28:47.515
It, it affects your heart. It gives you humble sacrifice.

570
00:28:47.535 --> 00:28:50.515
It also helps you grow in the way that you have

571
00:28:50.515 --> 00:28:51.795
to teach something to somebody else.

572
00:28:51.895 --> 00:28:52.915
Man, you better know it, right?

573
00:28:52.915 --> 00:28:55.675
That all of that, that's part of the process of serving.

574
00:28:55.695 --> 00:28:58.635
That's how God uses other people to reveal his glory to us.

575
00:29:00.535 --> 00:29:04.915
We can see it as we serve other people. He shows up to us.

576
00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:08.575
Then think about those outside the church,

577
00:29:08.575 --> 00:29:12.595
even enemies when you are loving them, we behold more

578
00:29:12.595 --> 00:29:15.235
of God's character as we love them.

579
00:29:15.305 --> 00:29:16.795
Like this is what God did with us

580
00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:18.315
and we're convicted when we don't do it.

581
00:29:18.315 --> 00:29:20.995
Well. This is God's loving of us as enemies.

582
00:29:21.315 --> 00:29:22.875
I can love my enemy as well.

583
00:29:23.095 --> 00:29:26.275
God uses other people to reveal his glory to us.

584
00:29:28.685 --> 00:29:32.105
And so over the course of your life, as you walk

585
00:29:32.105 --> 00:29:35.105
through the entirety of your life, as you behold the glory

586
00:29:35.105 --> 00:29:36.425
of the Lord, in all of these ways

587
00:29:36.445 --> 00:29:39.625
and many other ways, you should be able to see

588
00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:43.265
progressive growth over time.

589
00:29:44.265 --> 00:29:46.975
Again, not immediate. It may look a little bit like this

590
00:29:47.235 --> 00:29:51.335
as you go, but over time it will progressively show up.

591
00:29:51.475 --> 00:29:52.655
Here's the temptation though,

592
00:29:52.655 --> 00:29:55.415
that I face in my life, and you probably do as well.

593
00:29:56.205 --> 00:29:59.775
When we talk about growth, it is really tempting to start

594
00:29:59.895 --> 00:30:02.745
to compare yourself with other people and their growth.

595
00:30:06.135 --> 00:30:09.665
It's really tempting to say, man, that guy, he's

596
00:30:09.765 --> 00:30:12.945
so far ahead of me, and it can get discouraging to me.

597
00:30:14.605 --> 00:30:16.785
It can also get prideful as you start to compare yourself.

598
00:30:16.785 --> 00:30:17.825
Man, why didn't they figure this out?

599
00:30:17.845 --> 00:30:19.705
I'm this far along, and that's wrong too.

600
00:30:20.165 --> 00:30:22.545
But more likely the temptation is for you

601
00:30:22.545 --> 00:30:24.705
to compare yourself to somebody who's further down the road

602
00:30:24.845 --> 00:30:26.105
and you get discouraged by that.

603
00:30:26.175 --> 00:30:27.225
Hear me? Don't do that.

604
00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:30.965
You can learn from people who are further along,

605
00:30:30.965 --> 00:30:33.005
but don't get discouraged by people who are further along.

606
00:30:33.005 --> 00:30:34.365
Because remember this illustration,

607
00:30:34.405 --> 00:30:35.765
I used it earlier in the series,

608
00:30:36.035 --> 00:30:39.685
like when you see an oak tree, how did that thing start?

609
00:30:39.825 --> 00:30:44.805
Art? It was some absent-minded squirrel carrying an acorn,

610
00:30:44.865 --> 00:30:47.405
dug it hole, buried it, forgot where it was,

611
00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:48.845
and what did God do?

612
00:30:49.835 --> 00:30:52.845
Brought the rain began to germinate, that

613
00:30:53.375 --> 00:30:54.725
roots started to grow down.

614
00:30:55.995 --> 00:30:59.855
Uh, a little stem started to pop up above the ground.

615
00:31:01.155 --> 00:31:05.075
Tiny little branches coming off buds of leaves.

616
00:31:05.255 --> 00:31:06.675
So tender on the branches.

617
00:31:10.155 --> 00:31:11.895
Now you look at that and like, that's not much.

618
00:31:12.035 --> 00:31:13.775
We mow over those things all the time, right?

619
00:31:16.535 --> 00:31:18.035
But that's an oak tree, isn't it?

620
00:31:20.365 --> 00:31:21.745
That's, that's an oak tree.

621
00:31:22.905 --> 00:31:26.165
It may be small, but that's an oak tree.

622
00:31:27.615 --> 00:31:29.555
It may not be producing a lot of fruit yet,

623
00:31:29.695 --> 00:31:31.435
but that is an oak tree.

624
00:31:31.495 --> 00:31:34.075
It may not be 30 tons like that other one was,

625
00:31:34.375 --> 00:31:35.955
but it's an oak tree.

626
00:31:36.215 --> 00:31:37.995
That's what the spirit does in you friend.

627
00:31:37.995 --> 00:31:39.995
Listen, what may be small.

628
00:31:40.175 --> 00:31:44.795
Now, he intends to grow that into a powerful image

629
00:31:45.405 --> 00:31:46.955
reflecting his glory

630
00:31:49.935 --> 00:31:53.355
as you offer yourself as a living sacrifice, as you

631
00:31:54.185 --> 00:31:57.515
John 15 talks about, as you abide in him, he begins

632
00:31:57.515 --> 00:32:00.995
to produce those buds of fruit in your life

633
00:32:01.265 --> 00:32:04.755
that eventually feed others and plant new trees.

634
00:32:06.255 --> 00:32:07.975
I love the way one preacher put this.

635
00:32:07.975 --> 00:32:08.975
It's a little bit of a long quote,

636
00:32:08.975 --> 00:32:10.855
but listen, as a follower of Jesus,

637
00:32:11.035 --> 00:32:12.415
the spirit of God is in you.

638
00:32:13.005 --> 00:32:15.175
He's not just rushing upon you and then leaving you.

639
00:32:15.315 --> 00:32:16.895
He actually has rushed upon you

640
00:32:17.075 --> 00:32:20.645
and dwells in you now so

641
00:32:20.645 --> 00:32:22.885
that you might be turned into a totally different person

642
00:32:23.225 --> 00:32:26.125
and be conformed, transformed into the image

643
00:32:26.125 --> 00:32:27.285
of Jesus more today.

644
00:32:28.705 --> 00:32:31.405
That's the spirit's desire in your life today

645
00:32:31.585 --> 00:32:33.285
to transform you more and more

646
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:34.685
and more into the image of Jesus

647
00:32:35.235 --> 00:32:38.845
more tomorrow at this time than you are right now at this

648
00:32:38.845 --> 00:32:42.005
time, looking more like Jesus, thinking more like Jesus,

649
00:32:42.425 --> 00:32:46.085
loving more like Jesus, speaking more like Jesus.

650
00:32:47.505 --> 00:32:51.725
See, when God plants an acorn, he means an oak tree.

651
00:32:53.035 --> 00:32:55.255
He means for that to be an oak.

652
00:32:55.255 --> 00:32:57.375
That's what he's doing in you believer.

653
00:32:58.035 --> 00:32:59.375
That's what He's doing in me.

654
00:32:59.715 --> 00:33:03.495
It doesn't look like that yet, but it's on the way

655
00:33:04.505 --> 00:33:05.565
and he's working it out.

656
00:33:05.595 --> 00:33:09.485
He's doing it in your life as you submit to him.

657
00:33:09.545 --> 00:33:10.765
And you know why he does it that way.

658
00:33:12.045 --> 00:33:13.665
You know why he's transforming you,

659
00:33:14.755 --> 00:33:17.165
because that brings him so much more glory.

660
00:33:18.995 --> 00:33:20.725
Like that's what this piece,

661
00:33:20.745 --> 00:33:22.405
the Holy Spirit's transformation,

662
00:33:22.405 --> 00:33:25.685
what it does is it reflects God's glory.

663
00:33:27.795 --> 00:33:29.925
Like it shows him off to the world.

664
00:33:30.115 --> 00:33:33.365
When you are progressively changed into the image of Christ,

665
00:33:33.465 --> 00:33:36.725
it shows God off to the world.

666
00:33:38.555 --> 00:33:40.935
And notice what verse 18 said, we behold the glory

667
00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:41.975
of God, we see it.

668
00:33:42.075 --> 00:33:43.255
But then verse 18 says,

669
00:33:43.345 --> 00:33:46.975
we're being transformed into the same image from one degree

670
00:33:46.975 --> 00:33:48.775
of glory to another.

671
00:33:51.365 --> 00:33:52.775
Like this is the ultimate purpose

672
00:33:52.795 --> 00:33:54.335
of your transformation in life.

673
00:33:54.865 --> 00:33:58.895
God's glory being displayed through transformed lives,

674
00:33:59.045 --> 00:34:00.215
empowered by His spirit.

675
00:34:00.395 --> 00:34:02.135
That's what he designed for us.

676
00:34:04.455 --> 00:34:07.585
Like when we live as these kind of Romans 12 Christians,

677
00:34:08.645 --> 00:34:11.065
and we offer our bodies of living sacrifices,

678
00:34:11.325 --> 00:34:13.145
we serve using our gifts.

679
00:34:13.485 --> 00:34:15.985
We are looking to overcome evil with good.

680
00:34:16.195 --> 00:34:17.785
We're loving even our enemies,

681
00:34:17.875 --> 00:34:19.625
we're loving our brothers, all of that.

682
00:34:19.775 --> 00:34:23.705
When we do that, Romans 12, we become mirrors

683
00:34:24.995 --> 00:34:27.825
reflecting God's glory to the world.

684
00:34:30.855 --> 00:34:33.635
And so we're changed by God's spirit. Absolutely we are.

685
00:34:33.735 --> 00:34:37.715
But that's not merely for our benefit, not so you can walk

686
00:34:37.715 --> 00:34:40.235
around and say how powerful of a Christian you are.

687
00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:47.235
He transforms us so that God's own glory shines

688
00:34:47.235 --> 00:34:51.115
through ordinary believers like us living extraordinary

689
00:34:51.245 --> 00:34:53.435
lives, empowered by the spirit of God.

690
00:34:54.955 --> 00:34:56.095
Man, that shows him off.

691
00:35:00.625 --> 00:35:04.265
Now, I mentioned Moses earlier, it's the context

692
00:35:04.365 --> 00:35:07.585
of two Corinthians three in,

693
00:35:07.685 --> 00:35:09.945
in Israel's exodus from slavery in Egypt.

694
00:35:09.945 --> 00:35:11.505
There's an interesting part of Moses' life

695
00:35:11.505 --> 00:35:12.905
that might often get overlooked.

696
00:35:14.555 --> 00:35:17.455
See, Moses went up to the mountain, Mount Sinai to meet

697
00:35:17.455 --> 00:35:18.495
with God twice.

698
00:35:20.445 --> 00:35:22.705
The second time when he came back down from the mountain,

699
00:35:22.705 --> 00:35:24.145
after seeing the glory of God,

700
00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:25.225
he comes down from the mountain

701
00:35:25.325 --> 00:35:28.545
and his face is shining with the glory of God.

702
00:35:30.225 --> 00:35:32.925
And he gets down to the camp and everybody is terrified

703
00:35:32.925 --> 00:35:34.165
because they know the glory

704
00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:36.125
of God could strike them down at any point

705
00:35:36.235 --> 00:35:37.805
that they could die because of it.

706
00:35:37.805 --> 00:35:39.605
And so they're like, Hey, Moses, no, no, no.

707
00:35:39.605 --> 00:35:40.645
You need to put something over that.

708
00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:45.025
And so he veiled his face So they wouldn't see it.

709
00:35:48.435 --> 00:35:50.855
Do you remember what second Corinthians three talked about

710
00:35:51.635 --> 00:35:56.275
For us, for those

711
00:35:56.275 --> 00:35:58.395
of us who've been made alive by the Spirit,

712
00:35:59.135 --> 00:36:01.435
who've seen God's glory in the gospel,

713
00:36:04.065 --> 00:36:06.915
that need for a veil has been taken away.

714
00:36:09.705 --> 00:36:11.275
Because here's the difference.

715
00:36:12.095 --> 00:36:15.035
The glory that we behold is a new covenant.

716
00:36:15.525 --> 00:36:18.355
Moses was on the old covenant. We're under new covenant.

717
00:36:18.355 --> 00:36:19.795
That will not fade

718
00:36:19.975 --> 00:36:23.235
and that will transform us into the same degree

719
00:36:23.295 --> 00:36:25.235
of glory from one degree to the next.

720
00:36:26.615 --> 00:36:27.835
That's the difference today,

721
00:36:27.865 --> 00:36:30.875
because of that new covenant of God's grace

722
00:36:30.875 --> 00:36:32.035
through Jesus' life, death,

723
00:36:32.035 --> 00:36:34.995
and resurrection, this is the unveiled face

724
00:36:34.995 --> 00:36:36.475
that we shine brightly.

725
00:36:36.615 --> 00:36:37.955
We don't have to veil it anymore

726
00:36:37.955 --> 00:36:39.235
because it's good news

727
00:36:39.665 --> 00:36:41.275
that people don't need to be afraid of it.

728
00:36:41.305 --> 00:36:43.475
They need to see it and say, man, I want some of that.

729
00:36:44.375 --> 00:36:46.675
That's the glory of God shining through the grace

730
00:36:46.695 --> 00:36:48.075
of God in our lives.

731
00:36:48.375 --> 00:36:51.435
Our lives are intended to reflect God's glory

732
00:36:51.695 --> 00:36:53.115
to this dark world.

733
00:36:53.935 --> 00:36:56.595
That's the reason God did this.

734
00:36:56.595 --> 00:36:58.395
That's the reason God created you.

735
00:36:58.495 --> 00:37:02.235
Isaiah 43 says, that's the reason the Spirit recreated you.

736
00:37:02.425 --> 00:37:06.795
Ephesians two says, this is so you and I would behold him

737
00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:11.115
and walk in the spirit's transformation in our lives so

738
00:37:11.115 --> 00:37:13.155
that people will see our good works

739
00:37:13.575 --> 00:37:15.515
and glorify our Father who is in heaven.

740
00:37:16.545 --> 00:37:18.835
It's why he designed you. It's why he recreated you.

741
00:37:19.135 --> 00:37:21.515
So let's pray. Now, let's, let's ask,

742
00:37:21.725 --> 00:37:24.155
let's all ask the Lord, if you would just bow your head

743
00:37:24.155 --> 00:37:25.995
with me right now and just say, God,

744
00:37:26.215 --> 00:37:28.235
and maybe, maybe this is the first time you've ever done

745
00:37:28.235 --> 00:37:31.435
this, but You would just say to God,

746
00:37:34.735 --> 00:37:37.275
listen, Lord, I I don't understand all of it.

747
00:37:39.295 --> 00:37:43.555
God, I don't know where all of this will end as far as

748
00:37:43.775 --> 00:37:45.315
how it's gonna play out day by day,

749
00:37:45.455 --> 00:37:46.875
but I do know where it will end.

750
00:37:47.075 --> 00:37:48.395
I know it will end Jesus with you,

751
00:37:48.395 --> 00:37:51.475
making me perfectly like you when you return

752
00:37:55.095 --> 00:37:57.475
and, and here's the the part maybe you've never prayed to.

753
00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.595
Just maybe open your hands.

754
00:37:58.655 --> 00:38:02.635
And just to say to God, I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

755
00:38:03.935 --> 00:38:06.515
I'm willing to, to experience whatever

756
00:38:06.515 --> 00:38:07.555
you want me to experience.

757
00:38:07.655 --> 00:38:09.875
I'm willing to walk through whatever you want me to walk

758
00:38:10.155 --> 00:38:14.435
through so that you get more glory

759
00:38:14.705 --> 00:38:18.595
through my life as you change me into your image.

760
00:38:21.025 --> 00:38:22.155
Like that's a scary prayer.

761
00:38:22.275 --> 00:38:26.845
I know, but that's

762
00:38:26.845 --> 00:38:28.565
what God wants to do in you.

763
00:38:30.395 --> 00:38:31.525
It's why he designs you.

764
00:38:31.555 --> 00:38:35.045
It's why he re redesigns you in the spirit.

765
00:38:37.835 --> 00:38:41.815
And there's hope in this because you don't deserve it.

766
00:38:43.735 --> 00:38:46.775
I don't deserve it. Yet, he graciously gave forgiveness

767
00:38:47.315 --> 00:38:48.775
as far off from the alignment

768
00:38:48.775 --> 00:38:51.375
that I am hegra granted me Grace,

769
00:38:53.165 --> 00:38:57.735
granted you grace by the blood of Jesus shed for you.

770
00:39:00.275 --> 00:39:04.415
So what else response should we give? But he's worthy.

771
00:39:07.355 --> 00:39:11.295
So I'll just invite you to submit to him, to offer yourself

772
00:39:11.395 --> 00:39:12.735
as a living sacrifice.

773
00:39:12.885 --> 00:39:14.095
Holy, already holy

774
00:39:14.115 --> 00:39:16.815
and pleasing to God as your spiritual act of worship.

775
00:39:17.155 --> 00:39:19.175
To then say, God, I don't want to conform to the world.

776
00:39:19.295 --> 00:39:23.335
I wanna be transformed by you. Make me different.

777
00:39:23.485 --> 00:39:27.655
Make me different. That a year from now we look back

778
00:39:27.715 --> 00:39:29.495
and see how much you have done.

779
00:39:29.875 --> 00:39:33.375
As I've rejoiced in your gospel, glory,

780
00:39:33.805 --> 00:39:35.015
I've studied your word.

781
00:39:35.015 --> 00:39:37.015
I've been around believers, I've served the church.

782
00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:40.295
I've cared for my neighbors. I've loved my enemies.

783
00:39:40.475 --> 00:39:42.775
God I've, I've seen you grow me in all those things.

784
00:39:44.435 --> 00:39:45.735
Not where I need to be yet, but praise God.

785
00:39:45.735 --> 00:39:49.895
I'm not where I was. Just submit to

786
00:39:49.895 --> 00:39:53.335
that, Lord, help us.

787
00:39:53.365 --> 00:39:55.095
This is your work. We need you to do it.

788
00:40:00.295 --> 00:40:04.035
So for your glory, we pray in Jesus' name, amen.

789
00:40:04.775 --> 00:40:05.835
If you're able, let's stand together

790
00:40:05.835 --> 00:40:08.675
and respond that he is the one who does this

791
00:40:09.015 --> 00:40:09.875
and submit to that.
