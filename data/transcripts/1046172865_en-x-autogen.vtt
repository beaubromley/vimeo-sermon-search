1
00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:19.905
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:21.625
It's great to see you today.

3
00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:23.665
Uh, be together to worship today.

4
00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:25.785
Uh, my name is John, one of the pastors here.

5
00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:27.825
If you're new to our church, we'd love to meet you.

6
00:00:27.925 --> 00:00:30.305
Uh, either come introduce yourself up here at the front

7
00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:33.905
afterwards, or the new here area in the lobby just to get

8
00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:35.065
to meet you and help you connect

9
00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:36.585
to our church as best we can.

10
00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:39.265
Uh, as we get into it today,

11
00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:43.225
jealousy can make you do some crazy things, can't it?

12
00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.865
Jealousy can lead someone

13
00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:49.985
to create a fake social media account strictly

14
00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:53.345
to flame someone who is their, their perception

15
00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.905
to be more popular or more athletic or smarter

16
00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:58.185
or whatever it is than they are.

17
00:00:59.485 --> 00:01:01.225
Or it can lead someone to physical violence.

18
00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:04.265
As they think about this comparison trap

19
00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:06.985
that they're stuck in, it can actually lead to violence

20
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.705
or as the story goes, two shopkeepers were bitter rivals

21
00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:16.825
and their stores were directly across the street from each

22
00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:20.305
other, and they would spend each day like comparing

23
00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:22.745
and keeping track of each other's business.

24
00:01:24.205 --> 00:01:28.825
If one got a customer, he would smile slyly at the other one

25
00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:32.465
and triumph over his rival.

26
00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:35.905
Well, one night an angel appeared to one

27
00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:37.305
of the shopkeepers in a dream

28
00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:41.465
and he said, I will give you anything you ask,

29
00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:46.945
but know that I will give your rival twice as much.

30
00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.945
Would you be rich? Well, you can be rich,

31
00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:54.425
but he will be twice as wealthy.

32
00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:58.945
If you would be healthy. Well, you can be healthy,

33
00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:00.825
but you know that his life will be longer

34
00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:01.945
and more fulfilling.

35
00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:04.145
So what is your desire?

36
00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:08.025
Well, the shopkeeper thought, he frowned, he

37
00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:10.025
pro pondered for a moment.

38
00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:11.505
He said, well, here's my request.

39
00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:14.345
Strike me blind in one eye.

40
00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:21.185
Half of you got that one. So let me tell the other half.

41
00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:23.905
I'll give you double. I'll give

42
00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:24.985
him double what I give you, right?

43
00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:27.865
So one, okay, anyway, all right. Whew.

44
00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:30.865
Uh, that's why I don't start with jokes ever.

45
00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:32.025
Like that's just the way it is.

46
00:02:32.145 --> 00:02:34.705
I don't, okay, so jealousy can cause you

47
00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:35.745
to do some crazy things.

48
00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.665
I'll change that for the second service.

49
00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:42.625
Um, but it's not just with relationships

50
00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:44.225
or with stuff or with business.

51
00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:46.945
It doesn't just that way make you do some crazy stuff.

52
00:02:47.045 --> 00:02:48.825
It can even happen spiritually.

53
00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:53.505
Jealousy can creep into our lives. This is with pastors too.

54
00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:56.265
We can get this way. You can see like when God's hand is

55
00:02:56.265 --> 00:03:00.925
evidently on someone's life, like we have a choice,

56
00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:03.965
how we respond to that, we can be jealous.

57
00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:06.245
We can try to cut them down.

58
00:03:06.465 --> 00:03:08.925
We can just, just try to, to

59
00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:12.045
eliminate their influence somehow and,

60
00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:13.325
and just to make ourselves feel better.

61
00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:17.965
We can resist what God is evidently doing,

62
00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.565
or we can say, Hey, you know what?

63
00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:24.445
I'm gonna get on board with what God's doing

64
00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:25.485
and I'm gonna support it.

65
00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:27.765
We have that choice. And

66
00:03:27.765 --> 00:03:30.285
that's actually the stark contrast we're gonna see today

67
00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:35.165
in one Samuel 18, as, as God's presence is

68
00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:40.365
now clearly with David in the narrative, We're gonna watch

69
00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:44.765
how different people respond to that in various ways.

70
00:03:45.665 --> 00:03:49.445
And it's gonna challenge us to see whether we're going

71
00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:51.485
to sync up with what God is doing

72
00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:56.725
with his work in the world, even through other people,

73
00:03:56.775 --> 00:03:58.405
other churches, other ministries,

74
00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:01.605
or are we going to resist God's work as well?

75
00:04:03.905 --> 00:04:05.645
And so, God, we need you towards this.

76
00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:10.365
We need you to, to challenge us, to change us in our hearts.

77
00:04:10.365 --> 00:04:13.885
Every one of us in this room, every one of us watching needs

78
00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:18.145
something done in our hearts to more

79
00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:21.545
and better align with your purpose in the world,

80
00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:23.105
with your work in the world.

81
00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:26.865
So God lead us to that. We need you, holy Spirit.

82
00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:28.665
That's your work in our hearts through your word.

83
00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:31.345
And we pray that that would happen today for your glory in

84
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.265
name, amen.

85
00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:35.465
So if you're not already there,

86
00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:36.585
take your copy of God's word.

87
00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:38.745
Turn with me to one Samuel,

88
00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:42.665
chapter 18, one Samuel 18.

89
00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:45.385
We're gonna take all 30 verses of this together,

90
00:04:45.395 --> 00:04:48.545
continuing our series through this book, verse

91
00:04:48.605 --> 00:04:49.705
by verse in this.

92
00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:51.825
And, and so we're into chapter 18.

93
00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:53.705
And what we just saw was David had

94
00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:55.905
finally come on the scene.

95
00:04:56.205 --> 00:04:57.545
He defeated Goliath.

96
00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.505
He'd been anointed as the next king of Israel.

97
00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:04.585
But watch how people responded to David.

98
00:05:04.765 --> 00:05:07.025
Now follow along

99
00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:08.905
and read the whole chapter to give us the picture

100
00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:10.345
of it as we go forward.

101
00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:16.305
As soon as David had finished speaking to Saul, the soul

102
00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:19.345
of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David

103
00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:21.585
that Jonathan's David's or Saul's son.

104
00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:25.185
Jonathan loved David as his own soul, and Saul took him.

105
00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:27.825
David that day, would not let him return

106
00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:28.905
to his father's house.

107
00:05:29.415 --> 00:05:31.105
Then Jonathan made a covenant with David

108
00:05:31.335 --> 00:05:33.385
because he loved him as his own soul.

109
00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:36.145
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him

110
00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:38.625
and gave it to David, his armor, even his sword,

111
00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:39.745
his bow, his belt.

112
00:05:40.525 --> 00:05:41.585
And David went out

113
00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:44.265
and was successful wherever Saul sent him so

114
00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:46.505
that Saul set him over the men of war.

115
00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:49.465
And this was good in the sight of all the people

116
00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:51.185
and also in the sight of Saul's

117
00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:53.705
servants As they were coming home.

118
00:05:53.705 --> 00:05:55.825
When David returned from striking down the

119
00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:57.065
Philistine, that was Goliath.

120
00:05:57.505 --> 00:06:00.165
The women came out of all the cities of Israel singing

121
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:02.845
and dancing to meet King Saul with tambourines

122
00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:05.365
and songs of joy with musical instruments.

123
00:06:05.785 --> 00:06:08.085
And the women sang to one another as they celebrated.

124
00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.405
Saul has struck down his thousands

125
00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:12.525
and David his 10 thousands.

126
00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:17.365
And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him.

127
00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:20.125
And he said, they've ascribed to David 10 thousands to me.

128
00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:22.685
They've ascribed thousands. What more can he have?

129
00:06:22.785 --> 00:06:27.175
But the kingdom? And Saul ied David from that day on

130
00:06:28.435 --> 00:06:31.655
the next day, a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul

131
00:06:31.915 --> 00:06:34.935
and he raved within his house while David was playing the

132
00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:36.695
liar, as he did day by day.

133
00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:39.095
And Saul had a spear in his hand. And ha.

134
00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:41.095
And Saul hurled the spear for he thought,

135
00:06:41.095 --> 00:06:42.335
I'll pin David to the wall.

136
00:06:42.675 --> 00:06:47.015
But David evaded him twice and Saul was afraid of David

137
00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:49.095
'cause the Lord was with him, and he had de,

138
00:06:49.095 --> 00:06:50.975
but he had departed from Saul.

139
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.695
So Saul removed him from his presence, made him a commander

140
00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:57.575
of a thousand, just a small army commander,

141
00:06:57.715 --> 00:06:59.295
and he went out and came in before the people.

142
00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:01.535
And David had success in all his undertakings,

143
00:07:01.535 --> 00:07:02.815
for the Lord was with him.

144
00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:05.735
And when Saul saw that he had great success,

145
00:07:05.795 --> 00:07:07.695
he stood in fearful awe of him.

146
00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:12.095
But all Israel and Judah loved David for he went out

147
00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:13.135
and came in before them.

148
00:07:14.405 --> 00:07:17.855
Then Saul said to David, here's my elder daughter, Meab,

149
00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:19.215
I'll give her to you for a wife.

150
00:07:19.445 --> 00:07:21.935
Only be valiant for me and fight the Lord's battles.

151
00:07:22.715 --> 00:07:24.975
For Saul. Thought, well, let not my hand be against him,

152
00:07:24.975 --> 00:07:27.255
but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.

153
00:07:28.075 --> 00:07:30.815
And David said to Saul, who am I then? Who are my relatives?

154
00:07:30.815 --> 00:07:32.015
My father's clan in Israel

155
00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:34.455
that I should be son-in-law to the king?

156
00:07:36.115 --> 00:07:38.695
But at the time when Mirab Saul's daughter should have been

157
00:07:38.695 --> 00:07:40.895
given to David, she was given to Adriel, the

158
00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:42.775
Meite for a wife.

159
00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:47.135
Now, Saul's other daughter, McCall loved David.

160
00:07:47.835 --> 00:07:49.695
And they told Saul and the thing pleased him.

161
00:07:49.695 --> 00:07:51.975
And Saul thought, okay, let me give her to him

162
00:07:51.975 --> 00:07:54.135
that she may be a snare for him, that the hand

163
00:07:54.135 --> 00:07:55.815
of Philistines may be against him.

164
00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.375
And so Saul said to David, A second time,

165
00:07:58.635 --> 00:08:00.015
you shall now be my son-in-law.

166
00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:03.095
And Saul commanded his servants speak to David in private,

167
00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.375
say, behold, the king has delight in you.

168
00:08:05.555 --> 00:08:06.935
All his servants love you.

169
00:08:07.435 --> 00:08:09.015
Now then become the king's son-in-law.

170
00:08:09.015 --> 00:08:11.855
And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David.

171
00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:14.975
And David said again, does it seem to you a little thing

172
00:08:14.975 --> 00:08:16.575
to become the king's son-in-law?

173
00:08:16.665 --> 00:08:18.855
Since I'm a poor man, I have no reputation.

174
00:08:19.915 --> 00:08:22.775
And the servants of Saul told him that what David had said.

175
00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:25.135
And, and then verse 25, then Saul said, okay,

176
00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:26.975
thus you shall say back to David,

177
00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:30.975
the king desires no bride price except 104 skins

178
00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:33.455
of the Philistines, that he may Aven be avenged

179
00:08:33.455 --> 00:08:34.575
of his king's enemies.

180
00:08:35.435 --> 00:08:37.295
Now, Saul thought to make David fall

181
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.135
by the hand of the Philistines.

182
00:08:39.955 --> 00:08:41.775
And when his servants told David these words,

183
00:08:41.795 --> 00:08:44.615
it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law.

184
00:08:45.235 --> 00:08:47.855
And before the time had expired, David Arosen went along

185
00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:51.255
with his men and killed 200 of the Philistines.

186
00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:53.815
David brought the foreskins, which were given in full number

187
00:08:53.815 --> 00:08:56.140
to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law.

188
00:08:56.545 --> 00:08:58.685
And Saul gave him his daughter McCall for a wife.

189
00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:00.845
But when Saul saw

190
00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:03.645
and knew the Lord was with David, that McCall,

191
00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:07.845
Saul's gutter loved him, Saul was even more afraid of David.

192
00:09:08.585 --> 00:09:10.845
So Saul was David's enemy continually.

193
00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:12.805
And then the commanders of the

194
00:09:12.805 --> 00:09:14.125
Philistines came out to battle.

195
00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:15.725
And as often as they came out,

196
00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:19.405
David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so

197
00:09:19.405 --> 00:09:21.965
that his name was highly esteemed.

198
00:09:24.195 --> 00:09:28.245
Alright, so we look at the themes of this chapter,

199
00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:30.725
we're gonna see a couple of those themes,

200
00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:34.485
and here we see it's clear that in one Samuel 18,

201
00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:36.925
David was enjoying God's success

202
00:09:38.435 --> 00:09:41.045
evident throughout this passage that David,

203
00:09:41.105 --> 00:09:43.965
it was enjoying God's success.

204
00:09:43.965 --> 00:09:45.525
We actually see that word success four

205
00:09:45.525 --> 00:09:46.965
times in this chapter.

206
00:09:48.665 --> 00:09:50.005
It shows up in verse five.

207
00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:53.365
David was successful wherever Saul sent him.

208
00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:55.365
He became a leader among the army.

209
00:09:55.415 --> 00:09:59.685
Verse 14, David had success in all his undertakings.

210
00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:03.365
Verse 15, Saul saw David's success.

211
00:10:03.745 --> 00:10:05.165
And then verse 30, the very end,

212
00:10:05.165 --> 00:10:08.445
David had more success than all the servants of Saul.

213
00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:10.445
And that word means what you think. It means success.

214
00:10:10.545 --> 00:10:14.085
He was victorious. He was doing what he planned to do.

215
00:10:14.425 --> 00:10:18.205
See, we've been building to this plateau for weeks now.

216
00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.365
We saw Saul repeatedly

217
00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:24.405
declining in his spiritual health

218
00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:29.205
and David continually being elevated to the throne.

219
00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:32.045
There was growth happening, there was progress happening,

220
00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:34.965
but it's clear what's what God was doing here.

221
00:10:36.065 --> 00:10:39.085
He was fulfilling the promise he'd made to Samuel,

222
00:10:39.435 --> 00:10:40.605
he'd made to Saul.

223
00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:44.045
Even that Saul had been rejected from being the king.

224
00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:47.885
God was bringing that transition about,

225
00:10:47.905 --> 00:10:49.565
and he was proving it to everyone

226
00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:53.205
by this young new leader named David,

227
00:10:53.465 --> 00:10:56.445
giving him success in everything he attempted.

228
00:10:56.665 --> 00:11:01.125
God was saying, here's the man. Yet we read through that.

229
00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:02.965
It almost seems too good to be true.

230
00:11:03.075 --> 00:11:07.085
Like, like the old mythological God, Midas, you know that

231
00:11:07.085 --> 00:11:09.125
where everything he touched turns to gold.

232
00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:12.725
It seems like that's David's life right now. He can't lose.

233
00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.845
He can't have anything but success.

234
00:11:14.995 --> 00:11:17.365
It's just going everywhere. It should.

235
00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:22.805
But notice what we see the narrator be very careful

236
00:11:23.905 --> 00:11:26.765
to say here he says,

237
00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:28.965
why David was so successful.

238
00:11:28.985 --> 00:11:31.285
Did you see why? Look again at verse 12,

239
00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:39.205
Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with him,

240
00:11:40.145 --> 00:11:41.765
but had departed from Saul.

241
00:11:43.025 --> 00:11:47.725
Now, verse 14, David had success in all his undertakings,

242
00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:50.045
for the Lord was with him.

243
00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:53.685
Verse 28 actually says the same thing.

244
00:11:53.865 --> 00:11:58.685
The reason the reason David enjoyed God's success is

245
00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:01.085
because he experienced God's presence.

246
00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:04.525
He was enjoying God's success

247
00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:07.485
because he experienced

248
00:12:07.855 --> 00:12:09.765
God's presence in his life.

249
00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:14.765
Again, the contrast between Saul

250
00:12:14.765 --> 00:12:17.085
and David could not be clearer here

251
00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.685
it says it very clearly.

252
00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:24.005
The spirit of God had removed from Saul

253
00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:27.085
and the spirit of God was all over.

254
00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:29.205
David. You see that?

255
00:12:30.355 --> 00:12:34.445
That verse said it, it removed from Saul, yet was on David.

256
00:12:35.785 --> 00:12:37.565
Now it's a different world back then.

257
00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:40.725
Remember today the Holy Spirit indwells a believer from the

258
00:12:40.725 --> 00:12:43.285
moment of salvation securing them for eternity.

259
00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:46.965
But back then, before Jesus, back then, there was this,

260
00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:49.045
this measure of the spirit coming

261
00:12:49.065 --> 00:12:51.685
and going on people at certain times for certain reasons.

262
00:12:52.345 --> 00:12:54.245
And often the spirit of God would leave someone

263
00:12:54.355 --> 00:12:58.885
because of their sin, because of the issues in their life.

264
00:12:58.955 --> 00:13:01.165
Well, we saw that with Saul clearly here.

265
00:13:01.185 --> 00:13:04.685
But now we learn about David throughout his life,

266
00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:06.005
whether things were good or bad.

267
00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:10.245
David had an experiential knowledge of God's presence.

268
00:13:12.185 --> 00:13:14.445
The presence of God was the difference

269
00:13:14.645 --> 00:13:16.005
maker in David's life.

270
00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:22.965
Now, there was even a further result

271
00:13:22.965 --> 00:13:24.845
of God's presence on David's life.

272
00:13:26.115 --> 00:13:28.285
What we see with David here is that he began

273
00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:31.925
to receive other people's loyalty, like

274
00:13:31.925 --> 00:13:33.245
because the spirit of God was on him.

275
00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:34.805
He was bringing success to David.

276
00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:36.405
He had all these military

277
00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:37.845
battles and all the things worked well.

278
00:13:37.945 --> 00:13:41.885
But he also began to receive other people's loyalty.

279
00:13:44.285 --> 00:13:47.435
Again, there's a shift happening from Saul being the king

280
00:13:47.435 --> 00:13:50.275
and everybody loyal to the king, to David becoming the king.

281
00:13:50.295 --> 00:13:54.435
And the shift of loyalty is even happening in Saul's family.

282
00:13:57.065 --> 00:13:59.475
It's happening elsewhere, but it's even in Saul's family.

283
00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:01.715
We saw it right away at the beginning of the chapter, right?

284
00:14:01.855 --> 00:14:06.555
Saul's son, Saul's son, Jonathan gives his loyalty to David.

285
00:14:09.395 --> 00:14:10.995
Jonathan became David's best friend.

286
00:14:12.975 --> 00:14:15.155
He supported protected David for years.

287
00:14:15.165 --> 00:14:17.395
We'll see it throughout this whole book of first Samuel

288
00:14:17.985 --> 00:14:20.275
Saul, his son Jonathan,

289
00:14:20.855 --> 00:14:24.595
who would've been the heir apparent to Saul being the king.

290
00:14:24.835 --> 00:14:27.635
Jonathan would've been the next one. He's loyal to David

291
00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:29.835
in spite of his king father.

292
00:14:29.985 --> 00:14:32.675
He's protecting, supporting this new king.

293
00:14:35.095 --> 00:14:36.875
Now, some people have tried to make Jonathan

294
00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:38.755
and David's relationship more than

295
00:14:38.755 --> 00:14:41.555
what the text actually allows for that to happen.

296
00:14:41.775 --> 00:14:44.115
So don't read into this in any way,

297
00:14:45.895 --> 00:14:47.915
but what I want you to see is how deep

298
00:14:48.475 --> 00:14:50.035
Jonathan's loyalty was to

299
00:14:50.035 --> 00:14:51.035
David.

300
00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:54.085
Like did you see it? There was a soul

301
00:14:54.085 --> 00:14:55.285
level commitment there.

302
00:14:55.285 --> 00:14:58.085
There were four times in just three verses.

303
00:14:58.085 --> 00:15:00.525
The word soul is used by Jonathan,

304
00:15:03.355 --> 00:15:06.405
like they were brothers more than they were just friends.

305
00:15:10.245 --> 00:15:12.045
Jonathan aligned his life with David.

306
00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:14.125
He saw the anointing of God on David's life,

307
00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:15.205
and he says, I'm with you.

308
00:15:18.025 --> 00:15:21.005
And listen, I, I fear that most

309
00:15:21.025 --> 00:15:23.925
of us have no idea what that's like.

310
00:15:25.165 --> 00:15:27.005
I To have a friend like that.

311
00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:33.245
I read a study from 2021, so it's a few years old.

312
00:15:33.245 --> 00:15:34.565
I don't know if it's gotten better or worse,

313
00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:39.325
but it said at the time, 76%

314
00:15:39.385 --> 00:15:42.085
of men don't have a close trusted friend.

315
00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:49.445
Like three fourths of men don't have a man in their life

316
00:15:49.445 --> 00:15:51.565
that they could talk to about anything.

317
00:15:54.045 --> 00:15:57.135
Like no topic off limits, just I need somebody.

318
00:15:58.005 --> 00:15:59.455
Three-fourths don't have that.

319
00:16:02.965 --> 00:16:05.495
Like that's an epidemic level concern, isn't it?

320
00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:10.215
And so why is friendship dying?

321
00:16:12.885 --> 00:16:15.255
Because our culture, here's, here's a couple reasons.

322
00:16:15.355 --> 00:16:17.135
Our culture has sexualized everything.

323
00:16:17.155 --> 00:16:18.415
So it's hard for two men

324
00:16:18.415 --> 00:16:22.615
or two women to be really close friends without suspicion.

325
00:16:25.905 --> 00:16:29.215
We're also so ruggedly individualistic in our lives.

326
00:16:31.485 --> 00:16:33.695
Even though God, one of the first things he ever said was,

327
00:16:33.695 --> 00:16:35.175
it's not good for man to be alone.

328
00:16:35.435 --> 00:16:37.095
We love living our lives by ourselves.

329
00:16:39.325 --> 00:16:40.985
Listen, there is no such thing

330
00:16:41.405 --> 00:16:44.785
as a lone ranger Christian, right?

331
00:16:44.785 --> 00:16:46.905
You, you can't be that. That's an oxymoron

332
00:16:47.855 --> 00:16:51.905
because Christian implies family and connection.

333
00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:55.385
You can't be isolated as a Christian. You need each other.

334
00:16:55.705 --> 00:16:57.425
I need you, you need me. We need each other.

335
00:17:00.445 --> 00:17:02.225
But along with that, we're not only

336
00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:03.665
individualistic, we're also just too busy.

337
00:17:04.915 --> 00:17:09.225
We're too busy for friendships now to invest time

338
00:17:09.525 --> 00:17:12.785
and energy and resources in someone else and them and you.

339
00:17:12.815 --> 00:17:14.385
Does that cost you something? Yes.

340
00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:16.785
But the rewards are immeasurable.

341
00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:19.785
When you really have someone like that,

342
00:17:22.735 --> 00:17:26.705
like so can, can we as the church champion the resurrection

343
00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:31.425
of friendships, like to really have people in our lives

344
00:17:31.975 --> 00:17:35.945
that, that we, we are not too busy to pray, to listen,

345
00:17:36.325 --> 00:17:37.905
to care, to help.

346
00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:40.775
Nobody can walk alone.

347
00:17:40.845 --> 00:17:44.775
Like that's, that's a dangerous thing to walk alone.

348
00:17:46.755 --> 00:17:51.045
Can we be different? By the way, the church will be known,

349
00:17:51.045 --> 00:17:55.685
Jesus said, we'll be known by our love for one another, not

350
00:17:55.685 --> 00:17:58.165
by our great worship services or our big buildings,

351
00:17:58.165 --> 00:18:02.325
or a lot of like, how are they gonna know us love?

352
00:18:03.505 --> 00:18:04.725
And if we don't love each other that way,

353
00:18:04.955 --> 00:18:06.245
like what are we doing?

354
00:18:08.065 --> 00:18:12.085
So can we champion this Saul's son, Jonathan

355
00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:16.135
showed us, but it wasn't just Saul's son,

356
00:18:16.875 --> 00:18:18.135
so it was his family, right?

357
00:18:18.675 --> 00:18:21.095
It was also his daughter, right?

358
00:18:21.095 --> 00:18:24.775
It was in Saul's family, the king's family who are aligning

359
00:18:24.775 --> 00:18:26.975
with this new King Saul's daughter.

360
00:18:26.975 --> 00:18:31.095
Verse 20, Saul's daughter, McCall says, loved David.

361
00:18:31.845 --> 00:18:35.215
It's a deep word right there. She saw God's hand on David.

362
00:18:35.355 --> 00:18:36.775
She said, I'm gonna align with him.

363
00:18:37.315 --> 00:18:39.055
Now, it didn't hurt that he was ruddy and handsome.

364
00:18:39.115 --> 00:18:40.535
I'm sure that was probably a added benefit,

365
00:18:40.875 --> 00:18:42.935
but she saw God's hand, right?

366
00:18:45.235 --> 00:18:47.935
But again, it's amazing. Even in Saul's own household,

367
00:18:48.645 --> 00:18:51.575
they recognized the hand of God on David's life.

368
00:18:51.835 --> 00:18:53.255
And they said, I'm with him now,

369
00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:56.135
which drove Saul even more mad.

370
00:18:59.675 --> 00:19:03.695
Yet it wasn't just his family, it was bigger than that.

371
00:19:03.995 --> 00:19:06.295
Did you see throughout chapter 18,

372
00:19:06.635 --> 00:19:10.655
you saw it was also Saul's nation who threw its loyalty

373
00:19:10.795 --> 00:19:15.695
behind David, his son, his daughter, and even his nation.

374
00:19:18.305 --> 00:19:21.215
Verse five said, David being the leader of the army

375
00:19:21.835 --> 00:19:23.615
was good in the sight of all the people

376
00:19:23.715 --> 00:19:25.375
and also in the sight of Saul's servants.

377
00:19:26.545 --> 00:19:28.695
Verse seven records, the women's song, right?

378
00:19:29.015 --> 00:19:31.095
Remember that Saul's exploits compared

379
00:19:31.095 --> 00:19:32.655
to David's greater exploits.

380
00:19:34.145 --> 00:19:37.535
Verse 16, all Israel and Judah loved David.

381
00:19:39.325 --> 00:19:43.935
Even the very end, verse 30, his name was highly esteemed.

382
00:19:44.285 --> 00:19:46.575
Like this is the picture we're getting.

383
00:19:46.595 --> 00:19:47.535
And you remember the chart.

384
00:19:47.535 --> 00:19:48.695
We're gonna put it up here again.

385
00:19:48.765 --> 00:19:51.575
This is the chart we've shown throughout the whole cha

386
00:19:51.575 --> 00:19:52.815
whole series here.

387
00:19:53.035 --> 00:19:56.895
You see that as Saul is declining in his popularity,

388
00:19:56.895 --> 00:19:59.775
David is increasing in his popularity.

389
00:19:59.785 --> 00:20:02.775
We're about at that place where those two lines hit.

390
00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:07.455
David is growing and Saul is declining.

391
00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:09.375
One's up, one's down.

392
00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.695
That's where we're at in this scene now.

393
00:20:13.595 --> 00:20:15.815
So his daughter, his son, his nation,

394
00:20:15.845 --> 00:20:17.335
they were all turning towards Saul.

395
00:20:17.385 --> 00:20:19.455
There was one person in this whole thing

396
00:20:19.455 --> 00:20:21.095
that was not happy about all of that.

397
00:20:21.165 --> 00:20:23.135
Obviously it would be Saul, right?

398
00:20:26.275 --> 00:20:27.455
And from this point forward,

399
00:20:27.475 --> 00:20:29.975
we already saw it here consistently.

400
00:20:30.485 --> 00:20:33.015
Saul began to resist God's purpose.

401
00:20:35.355 --> 00:20:36.975
We saw it here. We'll see it

402
00:20:36.975 --> 00:20:38.295
throughout the rest of the book.

403
00:20:40.685 --> 00:20:42.175
Saul knew this was God's plan.

404
00:20:42.365 --> 00:20:44.575
This was God's purpose for David to be the king.

405
00:20:44.715 --> 00:20:46.735
And yet Saul resisted.

406
00:20:50.585 --> 00:20:53.365
I'm gonna read back through a couple spots in chapter

407
00:20:53.725 --> 00:20:54.805
18 verses eight and nine.

408
00:20:55.035 --> 00:20:58.365
Saul was very angry. This displeased him.

409
00:20:58.585 --> 00:21:00.725
He said, they've ascribed to David 10 thousands. To me.

410
00:21:00.725 --> 00:21:02.965
They've ascribed thousands. What more can he have?

411
00:21:03.465 --> 00:21:08.365
But the kingdom and Saul ied David, from that day on,

412
00:21:08.365 --> 00:21:09.965
there's jealousy all over that, right?

413
00:21:12.115 --> 00:21:13.615
And it makes you do crazy things.

414
00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:15.295
Watch this verses 10 and 11.

415
00:21:15.325 --> 00:21:17.215
Next, the next day, a harmful spirit from God

416
00:21:17.215 --> 00:21:18.255
rushed upon Saul.

417
00:21:18.395 --> 00:21:21.415
He raved within his house while David was playing the liar,

418
00:21:21.435 --> 00:21:24.215
as he did day by day, that used to calm Saul down.

419
00:21:24.675 --> 00:21:26.295
And Saul had his spear in his hand,

420
00:21:26.315 --> 00:21:28.495
and Saul hurled the spear for, he thought,

421
00:21:28.555 --> 00:21:29.735
I'm gonna pin David to the wall.

422
00:21:29.795 --> 00:21:32.935
I'm gonna kill him this time. But David evaded him twice.

423
00:21:33.115 --> 00:21:35.455
That's what jealousy did to Saul.

424
00:21:35.455 --> 00:21:39.015
Verse 15 says, Saul stood in fearful awe of David.

425
00:21:39.015 --> 00:21:43.535
That's not a good word. There he was scared,

426
00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:47.815
terrified to lose the kingdom to this new king.

427
00:21:51.155 --> 00:21:52.495
But you have to remember this.

428
00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.895
This is why we don't read these passage in isolation.

429
00:21:54.895 --> 00:21:58.015
The whole thing fits together. Saul already knew

430
00:21:58.725 --> 00:22:00.375
that David was gonna be the next king.

431
00:22:02.115 --> 00:22:04.535
He knew that was God's plan. He knew that was God's purpose.

432
00:22:05.955 --> 00:22:07.775
And so Saul had a choice.

433
00:22:10.155 --> 00:22:14.095
He could have humbled himself, embraced that plan,

434
00:22:14.555 --> 00:22:15.855
got outta David's way.

435
00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:22.235
But what did he do instead? He tried

436
00:22:22.235 --> 00:22:23.915
to set up David's death twice.

437
00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:25.875
He tried to kill David twice.

438
00:22:31.295 --> 00:22:33.725
Again, though the cumulative effect of all of it was that.

439
00:22:33.725 --> 00:22:37.005
Verse 29 says, Saul was even more of afraid of David.

440
00:22:39.505 --> 00:22:44.045
So Saul was David's enemy continually till the end

441
00:22:44.065 --> 00:22:47.765
of Saul's life, these two anointed

442
00:22:47.835 --> 00:22:49.245
ones are at odds.

443
00:22:52.345 --> 00:22:54.525
And listen, that's, that's one aspect of this that each

444
00:22:54.525 --> 00:22:57.685
of us need to consider today as well.

445
00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:05.325
How can we resist God's purpose in the world around us?

446
00:23:08.235 --> 00:23:12.965
What are ways that we can hinder God's work?

447
00:23:14.305 --> 00:23:15.805
God will do his work. God.

448
00:23:15.805 --> 00:23:17.165
God will accomplish his plan,

449
00:23:17.425 --> 00:23:21.405
but we can get in the way, have to

450
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:25.445
be removed so that God can do what he's gonna do.

451
00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:28.605
How can we do that? 'cause again,

452
00:23:28.675 --> 00:23:31.205
Saul could have humbly submitted to this process,

453
00:23:31.705 --> 00:23:33.645
and most likely we don't know this for sure,

454
00:23:33.665 --> 00:23:35.525
but most likely Saul would've had a

455
00:23:35.685 --> 00:23:36.965
place in David's kingdom.

456
00:23:39.565 --> 00:23:44.005
Jonathan did. But John, the son of Saul, he humbled himself,

457
00:23:44.005 --> 00:23:45.005
said, I'm with you, David,

458
00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:49.005
and had a place Saul probably could have as well,

459
00:23:49.145 --> 00:23:52.445
had a place to serve in David's kingdom.

460
00:23:52.905 --> 00:23:57.445
But rather than releasing his selfish grip on his

461
00:23:57.595 --> 00:23:59.285
cherished role as King

462
00:24:02.825 --> 00:24:05.555
Saul tried to prevent David from becoming king.

463
00:24:08.255 --> 00:24:12.315
And in the process, he destroyed himself with jealousy.

464
00:24:15.835 --> 00:24:16.955
I mean, Saul, think about it.

465
00:24:17.225 --> 00:24:18.955
He'd been called to such a high position.

466
00:24:19.145 --> 00:24:21.235
He'd been given such great abilities.

467
00:24:21.775 --> 00:24:26.395
But then he used that position and those abilities to oppose

468
00:24:26.975 --> 00:24:30.235
and to persecute the Lord's anointed.

469
00:24:31.735 --> 00:24:34.595
He could have used that position for such good,

470
00:24:34.815 --> 00:24:38.115
but he instead used it to try to hinder the pro.

471
00:24:38.115 --> 00:24:40.075
And really, he did hinder the progress

472
00:24:40.075 --> 00:24:41.715
of God's kingdom for many years.

473
00:24:42.575 --> 00:24:46.075
If he would've just stepped away, David would've stepped in.

474
00:24:46.375 --> 00:24:47.835
And the kingdom of God

475
00:24:47.835 --> 00:24:50.795
through Israel there would have just grown and expanded.

476
00:24:52.295 --> 00:24:55.275
But years and years of trial and trouble came from this.

477
00:24:57.535 --> 00:25:01.115
Listen, it's similar, similar for us today.

478
00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:07.065
Every time we place our own ambitions,

479
00:25:08.205 --> 00:25:12.665
our own selfish desires, our own goals

480
00:25:13.555 --> 00:25:15.185
above what God is doing

481
00:25:15.245 --> 00:25:18.905
or what God wants to do, we are just like Saul right here.

482
00:25:24.415 --> 00:25:28.665
Instead, we should celebrate what God is doing, right?

483
00:25:29.855 --> 00:25:32.825
Like even if it's not the way that we would've chosen it

484
00:25:32.825 --> 00:25:36.825
to go, even if it's happening

485
00:25:36.945 --> 00:25:38.065
through someone else,

486
00:25:41.765 --> 00:25:42.945
we should encourage it.

487
00:25:43.165 --> 00:25:44.665
We should celebrate it.

488
00:25:44.775 --> 00:25:48.105
Even if our lives don't look just like the plan

489
00:25:48.105 --> 00:25:49.945
that we had lined up for ourselves.

490
00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:55.025
Can we trust that God is still working through it?

491
00:25:56.725 --> 00:25:57.905
Or are we gonna get in the way

492
00:25:58.365 --> 00:25:59.665
and we're gonna hold onto something?

493
00:25:59.675 --> 00:26:03.785
We're gonna, I

494
00:26:03.785 --> 00:26:05.025
asked, I've asked this question.

495
00:26:05.095 --> 00:26:06.385
I've had this question asked to me.

496
00:26:06.605 --> 00:26:09.065
We pray for revival within the American church, right?

497
00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:12.905
We want God to blow the doors off churches and save people

498
00:26:13.005 --> 00:26:14.465
and draw people back to we.

499
00:26:14.465 --> 00:26:15.585
We pray for that. We want that.

500
00:26:16.045 --> 00:26:17.305
The question was asked, what if

501
00:26:17.305 --> 00:26:18.585
that happened in the church down the street?

502
00:26:18.585 --> 00:26:19.705
Would we still celebrate it?

503
00:26:22.525 --> 00:26:24.745
We should, but would we?

504
00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:29.105
Right? Like we pray for that, but

505
00:26:29.265 --> 00:26:32.105
'cause we want it here, what if God does it

506
00:26:32.455 --> 00:26:36.635
through someone else and we see God do amazing things?

507
00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:39.995
Are we gonna celebrate it, encourage it, champion it, pray

508
00:26:39.995 --> 00:26:42.115
for it, support it like that.

509
00:26:42.115 --> 00:26:44.485
That's, that's where, where jealousy and selfishness

510
00:26:44.505 --> 00:26:48.565
and greed and distraction, all of that stuff can be means

511
00:26:48.745 --> 00:26:51.285
by which we resist God's purpose.

512
00:26:55.065 --> 00:26:58.005
We work against what he's trying to do in us

513
00:26:58.225 --> 00:26:59.365
and what he's trying to do around us.

514
00:26:59.365 --> 00:27:00.885
That's church stuff. But but even think

515
00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:02.325
about inside our lives.

516
00:27:02.585 --> 00:27:03.765
If it's not the way we thought,

517
00:27:03.765 --> 00:27:05.165
if it's not the way we want it,

518
00:27:05.735 --> 00:27:07.205
God's still working through that.

519
00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:08.765
Are we going to resist it?

520
00:27:08.785 --> 00:27:11.245
Are we going to say, all right, I'm in.

521
00:27:12.245 --> 00:27:14.445
I don't understand it. It's not the way I wanted it,

522
00:27:14.465 --> 00:27:15.645
but I got, I got it.

523
00:27:15.745 --> 00:27:18.205
Submit. I'm going to love you. I'm going to follow you.

524
00:27:19.435 --> 00:27:21.565
Because here's what we should want more than anything.

525
00:27:23.105 --> 00:27:26.485
We should want to receive God's pleasure, right?

526
00:27:27.795 --> 00:27:31.005
Like, like we should want to receive

527
00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:32.845
God's pleasure.

528
00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:35.245
That's the the most important thing

529
00:27:35.245 --> 00:27:37.085
that we see in all of this.

530
00:27:37.265 --> 00:27:39.805
The, just think about sin for a second.

531
00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:43.525
Sin is breaking God's commands

532
00:27:43.865 --> 00:27:46.085
as we rebel against God's authority.

533
00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:53.445
What it is, and listen to this, it's in the Lord's prayer.

534
00:27:53.445 --> 00:27:56.205
We all pray, right? It's some point in our lives.

535
00:27:58.105 --> 00:28:02.445
Sin is saying, my kingdom come, my will be done.

536
00:28:05.105 --> 00:28:09.285
Is God gonna bless that perspective? No.

537
00:28:11.675 --> 00:28:14.215
But what we saw in David's life is

538
00:28:14.245 --> 00:28:18.055
what happens when we do please him.

539
00:28:18.365 --> 00:28:21.695
When we do align with his purposes, his will be done,

540
00:28:21.835 --> 00:28:25.375
his purposes on the earth in our lives.

541
00:28:25.605 --> 00:28:29.415
When we align with that, what we get is blessing.

542
00:28:31.435 --> 00:28:32.695
We get blessing from that.

543
00:28:34.995 --> 00:28:38.575
Now, as soon as I say that, I feel like I have to caveat it

544
00:28:39.725 --> 00:28:43.735
because our world, even the church world at large has said,

545
00:28:44.005 --> 00:28:45.575
what that means then is

546
00:28:45.575 --> 00:28:48.775
that when God's pleasure pours out on those who love you,

547
00:28:48.965 --> 00:28:50.855
that means that all of life is going

548
00:28:50.855 --> 00:28:52.015
to be up into the right.

549
00:28:53.005 --> 00:28:54.815
Like it's all gonna be successful.

550
00:28:54.925 --> 00:28:57.135
It's gonna look like Midas touch David over here.

551
00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:58.375
Everything's gonna go well.

552
00:28:58.395 --> 00:28:59.375
You're gonna get that job,

553
00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:00.655
you're gonna get that relationship.

554
00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:01.695
You're all that's gonna work.

555
00:29:04.515 --> 00:29:05.855
You're gonna be healthy, you're gonna be wealthy.

556
00:29:05.855 --> 00:29:07.055
Everything's gonna work for you.

557
00:29:07.155 --> 00:29:09.775
That's what God's blessing entails.

558
00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:13.495
That's a problem for the rest

559
00:29:13.515 --> 00:29:15.455
of the chapters that we're gonna go into.

560
00:29:15.455 --> 00:29:18.975
And for Samuel, because what we'll see is that David

561
00:29:19.615 --> 00:29:24.345
actually has to suffer, Even though God is with him,

562
00:29:26.045 --> 00:29:27.905
he walks through really difficult seasons,

563
00:29:28.015 --> 00:29:29.705
even though God is with him.

564
00:29:30.165 --> 00:29:32.785
But what we know is that in the end,

565
00:29:32.935 --> 00:29:35.505
because of God's pleasure on you,

566
00:29:35.695 --> 00:29:38.945
because it was on Jesus in your place,

567
00:29:39.435 --> 00:29:41.605
God's pleasure was fully on him.

568
00:29:42.105 --> 00:29:46.485
If you are in him, that means you have God's blessing.

569
00:29:48.705 --> 00:29:52.445
And it may not be now, but it certainly will be later.

570
00:29:53.955 --> 00:29:56.605
Because Jesus not only had God's blessing in life,

571
00:29:56.625 --> 00:29:58.085
he had God's blessing in death

572
00:29:58.225 --> 00:30:01.365
and in resurrection, which means you get it as well.

573
00:30:02.575 --> 00:30:04.115
And so there is an eternal blessing

574
00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:05.235
on the other side of this.

575
00:30:05.575 --> 00:30:07.835
But that's the point I'm trying to make here, is

576
00:30:07.835 --> 00:30:11.395
that in the moment, it may not feel like you're being

577
00:30:11.395 --> 00:30:12.475
blessed by God.

578
00:30:14.515 --> 00:30:16.595
I I love Hebrews 11 in the New Testament.

579
00:30:17.705 --> 00:30:19.075
It's a great example of this.

580
00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:21.955
We often refer to it as the hall of faith.

581
00:30:24.495 --> 00:30:27.035
And it talks about those who had faith in God,

582
00:30:28.495 --> 00:30:30.835
Who had assurance even though they couldn't see Jesus

583
00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:32.155
or they couldn't look back

584
00:30:32.155 --> 00:30:35.915
and see Jesus like we can, that they were saved

585
00:30:36.055 --> 00:30:38.675
by their faith, just as much faith in God

586
00:30:38.675 --> 00:30:40.195
that he was going to redeem.

587
00:30:41.175 --> 00:30:44.115
But verse six, in Hebrews 11 says, they believed

588
00:30:44.145 --> 00:30:46.635
because whoever would draw near

589
00:30:46.635 --> 00:30:48.795
to God must believe that he exists.

590
00:30:49.335 --> 00:30:52.155
And that he rewards those who seek him.

591
00:30:53.215 --> 00:30:56.435
That's why they did it. Because they knew he was God.

592
00:30:56.435 --> 00:30:58.195
They believed in him and they knew he was going

593
00:30:58.195 --> 00:31:00.115
to reward those who seek him.

594
00:31:00.115 --> 00:31:03.155
And and throughout Hebrews 11, many of the illustrations,

595
00:31:03.175 --> 00:31:05.475
it gives portray rewards.

596
00:31:07.025 --> 00:31:11.085
Abraham got a land, Moses got a victory.

597
00:31:12.815 --> 00:31:17.565
Sarah got a baby. The people got the land.

598
00:31:17.965 --> 00:31:21.325
Rahab, she got life when everyone else got death.

599
00:31:22.225 --> 00:31:23.485
And then listen to this, it says,

600
00:31:23.485 --> 00:31:25.485
many others conquered kingdoms,

601
00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:28.125
enforce justice, obtained promises.

602
00:31:28.475 --> 00:31:31.685
Stop the mouse of lions, quenched the power of fire,

603
00:31:31.985 --> 00:31:33.365
escape the edge of the sword.

604
00:31:33.555 --> 00:31:36.565
Were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war.

605
00:31:36.825 --> 00:31:40.005
Put foreign armies to flight, received back their dead

606
00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:41.085
by resurrection.

607
00:31:41.275 --> 00:31:43.365
Like that stuff is what we would celebrate

608
00:31:43.365 --> 00:31:45.405
and feel like, man, look, the blessing of God is on them.

609
00:31:45.595 --> 00:31:48.845
It's all great. We love championing that kind of stuff.

610
00:31:49.225 --> 00:31:53.765
Yet we often stop there and we miss what's next.

611
00:31:56.845 --> 00:31:58.805
'cause the scripture doesn't actually stop

612
00:31:59.345 --> 00:32:01.605
or pause even right there.

613
00:32:03.695 --> 00:32:06.515
It just continues explaining the

614
00:32:07.115 --> 00:32:08.835
blessings, faith brings.

615
00:32:12.405 --> 00:32:16.755
Watch this. Some were tortured,

616
00:32:18.115 --> 00:32:19.995
refusing to accept release so

617
00:32:19.995 --> 00:32:21.795
that they might rise again to a better life.

618
00:32:22.655 --> 00:32:25.155
Others suffered mocking and flogging

619
00:32:25.295 --> 00:32:27.475
and even chains and imprisonment.

620
00:32:27.905 --> 00:32:29.875
They were stoned. They were sawn in two.

621
00:32:30.065 --> 00:32:31.395
They were killed with a sword.

622
00:32:31.665 --> 00:32:33.435
They went about in skins of sheep

623
00:32:33.435 --> 00:32:36.795
and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated

624
00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:38.835
of whom the world was not worthy.

625
00:32:39.355 --> 00:32:42.605
Wandering about in deserts and mountains and in dens

626
00:32:42.745 --> 00:32:44.565
and caves of the earth.

627
00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:49.565
That's a pretty jarring difference, isn't it?

628
00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:55.395
Between what we saw, what seemed really good

629
00:32:55.695 --> 00:32:58.275
to all of a sudden now this seems really, really bad.

630
00:33:00.225 --> 00:33:03.835
Well, here's the point. It simply means that we cannot link

631
00:33:04.445 --> 00:33:09.075
God's pleasure on us merely to having a comfortable life.

632
00:33:14.795 --> 00:33:16.595
'cause you know what else Hebrews 11 says?

633
00:33:18.535 --> 00:33:19.955
It says none of them,

634
00:33:20.785 --> 00:33:22.635
whether they're in this first category,

635
00:33:22.635 --> 00:33:25.075
the things really easy, or the things that were really hard,

636
00:33:25.585 --> 00:33:29.075
none of them actually received the things

637
00:33:29.995 --> 00:33:34.835
promised from God because they

638
00:33:35.115 --> 00:33:37.035
were all pre Christ.

639
00:33:39.345 --> 00:33:41.715
They, they were all pre Jesus.

640
00:33:42.215 --> 00:33:44.195
So it says what they were looking for,

641
00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:46.915
what they were waiting for.

642
00:33:46.915 --> 00:33:49.675
Hebrews 1116 says, is a better country,

643
00:33:50.275 --> 00:33:53.035
a heavenly one, a better life?

644
00:33:56.175 --> 00:33:59.895
'cause they knew that that place, that country was

645
00:33:59.895 --> 00:34:02.495
where they would actually experience the full blessing

646
00:34:02.555 --> 00:34:03.735
and pleasure of God.

647
00:34:05.995 --> 00:34:08.455
Now, it's limited here. We might get glimpses of it here.

648
00:34:08.455 --> 00:34:10.695
Things might go well, like when you have a baby

649
00:34:10.755 --> 00:34:11.815
or you, you get that job.

650
00:34:12.045 --> 00:34:14.495
Like things do go well at times.

651
00:34:14.995 --> 00:34:18.335
But things here still can be hard.

652
00:34:18.605 --> 00:34:23.205
Even when we live by faith. Remember job

653
00:34:25.515 --> 00:34:28.405
Like The godliest man who may have ever lived

654
00:34:30.765 --> 00:34:32.565
scraping boils with pottery.

655
00:34:35.395 --> 00:34:37.445
That doesn't mean listen. If you're experiencing that,

656
00:34:37.445 --> 00:34:39.125
if you experience that because of your faith,

657
00:34:39.275 --> 00:34:41.125
that doesn't mean God's not good.

658
00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:43.805
That doesn't mean that God has abandoned you.

659
00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:47.485
It just means your eyes better be on something better,

660
00:34:47.825 --> 00:34:48.885
on something more eternal.

661
00:34:51.275 --> 00:34:52.325
Because This is limited.

662
00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:54.765
You can lose this things can go south really fast.

663
00:34:54.905 --> 00:34:58.525
It must be on something more where full blessing

664
00:35:00.675 --> 00:35:03.325
will be yours because of the life, death,

665
00:35:03.325 --> 00:35:05.125
and resurrection of Jesus Christ in your place.

666
00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:08.685
That He's overcome death. He's overcome this world.

667
00:35:08.905 --> 00:35:12.045
All the things that would go bad that would cause pain,

668
00:35:12.065 --> 00:35:14.085
the persecution, the struggle, all that.

669
00:35:14.395 --> 00:35:18.325
He's overcome it all. And the victory in Christ means we

670
00:35:18.325 --> 00:35:20.085
have resurrection in him as well.

671
00:35:20.085 --> 00:35:21.245
And that blessing will come.

672
00:35:21.425 --> 00:35:24.685
He had God's full blessing and he will forever.

673
00:35:25.065 --> 00:35:26.925
We can join in that.

674
00:35:27.795 --> 00:35:30.085
Like that's What we must

675
00:35:30.355 --> 00:35:31.685
pers must have that perspective.

676
00:35:31.825 --> 00:35:36.725
So until that time comes, until he does come back

677
00:35:36.725 --> 00:35:40.125
to what do we have, the perspective in our lives.

678
00:35:40.185 --> 00:35:42.925
That's why we must remember

679
00:35:44.025 --> 00:35:47.005
why David experienced what he experienced in chapter 18.

680
00:35:47.185 --> 00:35:49.605
Why did he have God's blessing and pleasure?

681
00:35:49.705 --> 00:35:53.645
Why was it because his focus in all of life was

682
00:35:53.645 --> 00:35:56.085
to rest in God's presence?

683
00:35:58.745 --> 00:36:02.365
He had success. He experienced God's blessing on his life.

684
00:36:02.505 --> 00:36:04.005
He had those things, yes.

685
00:36:04.005 --> 00:36:08.925
But his focus, his priority was to rest in God's presence.

686
00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:12.645
That was the difference maker for David.

687
00:36:15.795 --> 00:36:18.125
Everybody said it. Everybody saw it.

688
00:36:18.515 --> 00:36:20.805
That was, and listen, it's no different for us today.

689
00:36:23.375 --> 00:36:26.885
God's presence in your life is the difference maker

690
00:36:27.305 --> 00:36:28.485
for you and me today.

691
00:36:31.185 --> 00:36:34.285
And that concept, this is what we need to see with David.

692
00:36:34.435 --> 00:36:37.525
That concept of God's presence in his life was not just some

693
00:36:37.925 --> 00:36:39.165
abstract concept.

694
00:36:41.195 --> 00:36:43.725
Like he just kind of felt, yeah, God's presence is here.

695
00:36:43.785 --> 00:36:45.885
It was not really abstract for him.

696
00:36:46.025 --> 00:36:48.845
It had an impact daily on his life.

697
00:36:50.985 --> 00:36:53.645
And everyone could see it, right? Saul saw it.

698
00:36:53.905 --> 00:36:56.445
Saul's children saw it. The nation saw it.

699
00:36:56.445 --> 00:36:58.405
They're like, man, God's hand is on David.

700
00:36:59.975 --> 00:37:02.805
God's presence is with David. So here's the question.

701
00:37:05.345 --> 00:37:07.805
Is your life noticeably different

702
00:37:09.635 --> 00:37:11.645
because the presence of God is on you?

703
00:37:13.405 --> 00:37:14.885
Believer the presence of God is in you.

704
00:37:16.825 --> 00:37:19.325
Is your life noticeably different?

705
00:37:22.465 --> 00:37:24.445
Has has something changed to

706
00:37:24.445 --> 00:37:25.765
where people look at you like, man, what?

707
00:37:26.515 --> 00:37:28.485
What? What's going on here?

708
00:37:31.185 --> 00:37:32.525
And they're drawn to you or,

709
00:37:32.545 --> 00:37:34.125
or even the question here further,

710
00:37:35.265 --> 00:37:37.965
are some people even afraid of you

711
00:37:39.115 --> 00:37:42.565
because of the power of God flows through you.

712
00:37:45.345 --> 00:37:48.965
That's what we saw here right now.

713
00:37:48.965 --> 00:37:52.885
Now, listen, I'm not talking about people being afraid

714
00:37:52.885 --> 00:37:55.645
of you just because you're some odd duck.

715
00:37:55.705 --> 00:37:57.285
And in every conversation you throw a

716
00:37:57.285 --> 00:37:58.445
Jesus juke in there somehow.

717
00:37:58.515 --> 00:37:59.645
Like that's where people are scared.

718
00:37:59.675 --> 00:38:00.725
Like here he comes again.

719
00:38:00.725 --> 00:38:02.765
Like you know, you know those conversations

720
00:38:02.765 --> 00:38:06.245
where you're like, oh, okay, you got your ears pierced.

721
00:38:06.245 --> 00:38:08.445
That's cute. Jesus was pierced for our transgressions.

722
00:38:08.445 --> 00:38:11.285
Like, that's weird. Okay? Don't, don't do that.

723
00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.245
No, don't do. I'm talking about,

724
00:38:17.345 --> 00:38:18.485
I'm talking about Saul, right?

725
00:38:18.835 --> 00:38:20.765
Saul resisted God's purpose.

726
00:38:21.385 --> 00:38:24.005
He was actually afraid of David. Think about that.

727
00:38:24.705 --> 00:38:26.365
It should have been the other way around, right?

728
00:38:27.935 --> 00:38:29.765
David should have been afraid of Saul

729
00:38:29.765 --> 00:38:33.405
because this, this king Saul, he had a troubling spirit.

730
00:38:33.585 --> 00:38:35.365
He tried to kill David twice.

731
00:38:35.665 --> 00:38:36.925
He was the one with the upper hand.

732
00:38:36.945 --> 00:38:39.765
He had the powerful king figure all the support he needed.

733
00:38:39.785 --> 00:38:41.365
He could have got a servant do anything he wanted.

734
00:38:41.735 --> 00:38:43.205
David should have been afraid of Saul.

735
00:38:43.205 --> 00:38:46.485
But what was true, Saul was afraid of David.

736
00:38:48.565 --> 00:38:50.215
Saul was afraid of David. Why?

737
00:38:50.285 --> 00:38:52.295
Because of God's presence on David.

738
00:38:55.435 --> 00:38:59.665
Listen, if you are faithful to the Lord, if you are,

739
00:39:00.245 --> 00:39:03.825
if you are resting in God's presence

740
00:39:04.975 --> 00:39:07.145
through his word, through prayer,

741
00:39:07.965 --> 00:39:10.105
and you're resting in, you're dwelling,

742
00:39:10.105 --> 00:39:12.265
you're abiding in God's presence in your life,

743
00:39:12.285 --> 00:39:16.265
and you see this is the most important thing, you can know

744
00:39:16.615 --> 00:39:20.305
that God is with you, no matter your whatever, your face,

745
00:39:23.775 --> 00:39:25.065
your life will look different.

746
00:39:25.255 --> 00:39:28.705
Your life will noticeably show that something God is doing.

747
00:39:28.705 --> 00:39:30.865
He's working in your life

748
00:39:32.685 --> 00:39:36.305
and in spite of the hostility in the world,

749
00:39:39.005 --> 00:39:42.705
and often contrary to what it might appear to be on the

750
00:39:42.705 --> 00:39:46.505
outside, even your

751
00:39:46.505 --> 00:39:47.705
enemies will be afraid of you.

752
00:39:51.035 --> 00:39:52.425
Again, it might not look like it

753
00:39:53.415 --> 00:39:55.385
Because You might be taking shots right now

754
00:39:55.525 --> 00:39:58.985
as you're facing, but even at the core of who they are,

755
00:39:59.325 --> 00:40:02.545
the enemies will be afraid of you.

756
00:40:05.085 --> 00:40:09.785
The devil sure is right, the the devil.

757
00:40:11.085 --> 00:40:12.665
Why do you think he's coming after you so hard?

758
00:40:14.285 --> 00:40:16.305
Listen, if he's not, first of all, you should be worried

759
00:40:16.735 --> 00:40:18.625
because then you're not doing anything for God.

760
00:40:18.685 --> 00:40:19.745
The devil's not worried about you.

761
00:40:19.765 --> 00:40:21.865
But if he is coming at you hard,

762
00:40:22.125 --> 00:40:23.505
why is he trying to derail you?

763
00:40:24.025 --> 00:40:25.465
Distract you, destroy you. Why?

764
00:40:25.615 --> 00:40:28.665
Because he can't stand God's presence on your life.

765
00:40:29.795 --> 00:40:32.455
He can't stand God's presence in you believer.

766
00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:33.975
And so rejoice in that.

767
00:40:35.535 --> 00:40:38.015
Rejoice in the fact that you don't boast

768
00:40:38.015 --> 00:40:40.295
that somehow the strengths in you to overcome him.

769
00:40:40.435 --> 00:40:42.975
No, rejoice and rest in the fact that

770
00:40:42.975 --> 00:40:46.095
that strength you have comes from outside of you.

771
00:40:47.475 --> 00:40:51.695
It comes from Yahweh, and he's the one working through you.

772
00:40:51.755 --> 00:40:53.415
And the devil is terrified

773
00:40:55.845 --> 00:40:57.375
because it's not your strength.

774
00:40:57.485 --> 00:40:58.615
It's God's strength,

775
00:40:58.755 --> 00:41:03.495
and that is what makes all the difference and your life

776
00:41:04.275 --> 00:41:05.535
and through you in the world.

777
00:41:05.535 --> 00:41:06.735
That's what makes all the difference.
