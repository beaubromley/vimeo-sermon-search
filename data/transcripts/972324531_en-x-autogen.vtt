00:00:01.275 --> 00:00:03.605
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:06.805
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.565
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:13.925
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:17.125
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:28.165
What a blessing it is to be together.

7
00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:30.725
Good morning again, church, family. My name is John.

8
00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:32.965
If I haven't met you yet, I'd love to meet you sometime.

9
00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:36.445
Um, one of the pastors here, uh, we would just be encouraged

10
00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:37.725
to know that you came,

11
00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:40.365
and so please let us know that also, if you've been here

12
00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:42.805
for 60 years, we're encouraged that you came as well.

13
00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:44.325
So thank you for that.

14
00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:48.325
We do love everyone, uh, as we worship together.

15
00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:49.725
Now, one of the hardest things

16
00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:53.605
for me growing up was learning this concept of patience.

17
00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:58.845
Uh, we live in this culture of immediate gratification

18
00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.685
and it's hard to learn to wait.

19
00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:06.205
Even our world, our flesh itself perpetuates this idea.

20
00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:08.565
We hate waiting on anything, right?

21
00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:10.925
Uh, we have microwave dinners.

22
00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:12.925
We can't wait on it to be cooked.

23
00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:14.485
We spend hundreds of dollars

24
00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:17.165
to skip the line at Disney World, right?

25
00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:22.445
Uh, we even will buy a new phone just to shave

26
00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:25.965
microseconds off of the browser loading time

27
00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:27.965
that we can't wait any longer.

28
00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:29.525
Like it's amazing. I I was just thinking

29
00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:30.565
about this with my phone here.

30
00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:32.405
I amazing how

31
00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:36.165
I can get frustrated when it buffers at all

32
00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:38.765
when I'm watching a movie streaming

33
00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:41.125
to my phone in the middle of nowhere, right?

34
00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:44.205
Like how, when, when computers used to sound like this,

35
00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:57.075
Okay. Right.

36
00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.685
Okay. All right. I think we've had enough of that.

37
00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:02.525
All that's some trauma from that, I think.

38
00:02:02.585 --> 00:02:04.445
But, but that you, you remember that, right?

39
00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:05.565
And you had to wait and wait

40
00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:07.565
and then it was like 45 minutes to download.

41
00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:10.925
Anyway, so we were so spoiled.

42
00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:16.365
But here's what that culture of like faster and quicker

43
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:19.165
and now can do to us.

44
00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:23.765
It can deeply affect our relationship with God

45
00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:28.925
Because I know how hard it is for me like to stop

46
00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:33.085
and to slow down enough to just enjoy God

47
00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:35.885
and to to be in his word and to read

48
00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:37.885
and to pray and meditate.

49
00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:43.285
It can be hard because we're so driven towards speed.

50
00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:46.725
There's always the pull of, of whatever game or episode

51
00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:50.885
or movie or whatever else video we can have

52
00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:52.845
that we feel is way more entertaining.

53
00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:57.565
In fact, studies show it's rewiring our brains

54
00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:02.245
because of how we have this speed in our lives,

55
00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:03.805
but it also affects our relationship

56
00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:05.445
with God in in another way.

57
00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:11.045
We can easily get really frustrated with God

58
00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:15.405
whenever things don't turn out quickly enough the way we

59
00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:19.245
think they should when problems

60
00:03:19.245 --> 00:03:22.085
and struggles don't seem to resolve quickly,

61
00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:26.085
like we have to sit with

62
00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:28.285
that pain longer than we think we should,

63
00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:33.565
or we don't see justice coming as swiftly

64
00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:34.565
as we think it should,

65
00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:42.535
or we're waiting on a spouse

66
00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:44.975
or waiting on a baby.

67
00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:52.575
And so similar to last week, today in Psalm 70,

68
00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:56.575
we're gonna see King David be very honest

69
00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:01.815
about his struggle with having to wait on God,

70
00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:08.885
waiting on God to come through for him in his time of need.

71
00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:14.485
But we'll also be challenged with

72
00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:18.085
what our response should be, even in the midst

73
00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:21.085
of the temptation towards impatience.

74
00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:25.965
What should we do? How should we respond?

75
00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:28.245
And so let's ask God for help towards that right now.

76
00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:31.285
Lord, we need you to teach us,

77
00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:34.725
show us, change us.

78
00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:40.485
We need you, holy Spirit, to speak through your word

79
00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:44.645
directly to the corners of our hearts

80
00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:46.005
that we might have neglected

81
00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:51.005
or might have hidden to

82
00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:53.285
show us what you want us to see today

83
00:04:53.785 --> 00:04:55.485
and how to live in light of it

84
00:04:55.585 --> 00:04:57.805
for your glory in light of grace.

85
00:04:58.255 --> 00:05:03.165
Thank you. God help us in Jesus' name. Amen.

86
00:05:05.475 --> 00:05:07.495
And so look with me now at Psalm 70.

87
00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:11.175
This is the next Psalm, our series picking up in order.

88
00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:15.655
Psalm 70 will again show us David's heart.

89
00:05:15.845 --> 00:05:20.375
Look at it here heading

90
00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:22.975
to this choir, master of David.

91
00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:25.455
We know he wrote it then for the memorial offering.

92
00:05:26.905 --> 00:05:31.495
Verse one, make haste, oh God, to deliver me, oh Lord,

93
00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:33.255
make haste to help me.

94
00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:38.095
Let them be put to shame and confusion who seek my life.

95
00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:40.695
Let them be turned back

96
00:05:40.835 --> 00:05:43.775
and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.

97
00:05:45.515 --> 00:05:47.855
Let them turn back because of their shame.

98
00:05:48.195 --> 00:05:50.215
Who say, aha, aha.

99
00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:56.045
May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.

100
00:05:57.185 --> 00:06:00.325
May those who love your salvation say evermore.

101
00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.325
God is great,

102
00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:06.765
but I am poor and needy.

103
00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:11.085
Hastened to me, oh God, you are my help

104
00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:14.405
and my deliverer, oh Lord, do not delay.

105
00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:20.925
So this psalm is, is nearly a replica

106
00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:22.565
of a portion of Psalm 40.

107
00:06:23.335 --> 00:06:24.525
David wrote that as well.

108
00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:26.845
There's a bit of modification here and there and

109
00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:28.365
and you noticed in the super prescription

110
00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:30.605
that says something about a memorial offering a memorial,

111
00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:32.885
and it's like a word that means remembrance.

112
00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:37.765
So in other words, what David did here, probably both

113
00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:42.645
for himself but also for others, was to remind himself

114
00:06:42.705 --> 00:06:45.365
and others of these truths that he had already written

115
00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:48.005
and that he needed to remember in this moment.

116
00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:50.165
And he wanted everybody to sing this

117
00:06:50.165 --> 00:06:52.645
so they could remember these kind of things as well.

118
00:06:53.075 --> 00:06:55.765
That who God is, what he said he is.

119
00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:59.005
All of that's true no matter what you're facing.

120
00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:01.565
So it's a memorial.

121
00:07:03.345 --> 00:07:05.925
And notice there's a couple things here we can learn about

122
00:07:06.345 --> 00:07:08.005
God from this psalm.

123
00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:10.565
First, he said it very clearly

124
00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:13.365
that God is our help and our deliverer.

125
00:07:14.785 --> 00:07:17.125
That's the truths that he's wanting

126
00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:18.925
to remind himself and others about.

127
00:07:19.225 --> 00:07:21.605
God is our help and our deliverer.

128
00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:25.845
He said it directly there at the end of verse five,

129
00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:30.365
but if you notice, it was also in verse one, right?

130
00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:34.325
Make haste, oh God, to deliver me.

131
00:07:34.785 --> 00:07:39.645
Oh Lord, make haste to help me. Now we don't use that word.

132
00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:44.645
Make haste very often. It means hurry up, don't delay.

133
00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:49.585
Go quickly. He said it at the end of verse five.

134
00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:52.585
Again, Yahweh do not delay even the second line

135
00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:55.825
of verse five, he says, make haste hasten to me.

136
00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:56.985
Oh God. So he's,

137
00:07:57.335 --> 00:07:59.865
he's saying this thing like, this is urgent.

138
00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:03.615
God, He said it so many times,

139
00:08:03.615 --> 00:08:05.615
there's an urgency in his life and his heart.

140
00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:09.015
These enemies are pressing in really closely.

141
00:08:09.165 --> 00:08:11.095
They may be even at his doorstep

142
00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:13.895
and he says, God, you, you better hurry up here.

143
00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:19.335
I need you to hurry yet again.

144
00:08:19.335 --> 00:08:23.055
Don't forget that he viewed Yahweh as his help

145
00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:24.815
and his deliverer.

146
00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:31.795
Now it's easy to believe that phrase

147
00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:33.995
that God is our help and our deliverer.

148
00:08:34.015 --> 00:08:35.835
He it. It's easy to remember

149
00:08:35.835 --> 00:08:39.955
that when things are going really well in life, like

150
00:08:40.195 --> 00:08:42.515
whenever they interview the guy who scored the,

151
00:08:42.515 --> 00:08:45.635
the winning touchdown after the game, uh,

152
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.035
and he says, man, God came through for us.

153
00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:51.555
Right? It's easy to say that when you actually win,

154
00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:54.675
it's a lot harder, a lot more rare when someone says that

155
00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:56.725
after they missed the winning shot, right?

156
00:08:57.865 --> 00:09:00.805
And God came through for me today like, no, you don't.

157
00:09:00.805 --> 00:09:05.685
You don't hear that one. That's again why I love the

158
00:09:05.785 --> 00:09:07.405
Psalms, because they're honest.

159
00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:13.565
We see it here in David that he viewed God as his help

160
00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:16.405
and his deliverer even when he was

161
00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:18.745
needy, right?

162
00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:21.745
This is so clear right here that even when he was needy,

163
00:09:21.805 --> 00:09:25.785
he still saw God as his help and his deliverer.

164
00:09:29.425 --> 00:09:33.095
Verse five says, but I am poor

165
00:09:33.195 --> 00:09:36.975
and needy hasten to me, oh God, you are my help.

166
00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:39.695
My deliverer, oh Lord, do not delay.

167
00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:44.935
Now, we don't know when David wrote this psalm, it,

168
00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:48.855
it could have been when he was banished from Israel,

169
00:09:49.035 --> 00:09:50.655
hunted like an animal by those

170
00:09:50.655 --> 00:09:52.495
who were aligned with his son.

171
00:09:54.045 --> 00:09:57.615
That could have been very true about his life at this point

172
00:09:57.615 --> 00:09:59.855
where he was living in caves, he was on the run,

173
00:09:59.915 --> 00:10:02.655
he was eating what he could scrounge up from the world like

174
00:10:02.675 --> 00:10:05.135
he would have been needy at that moment.

175
00:10:06.435 --> 00:10:09.895
He wouldn't have written this when he was rich in the

176
00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:12.535
in the palace, all like he would.

177
00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:14.455
This is when he was needy.

178
00:10:14.455 --> 00:10:17.015
And so what he does here is he acknowledges it.

179
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.495
He said, I am poor and needy.

180
00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:25.455
And it was in that state that he turned to the Lord

181
00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:27.655
as his help and his deliver her.

182
00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:31.095
Listen, it's okay

183
00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:33.935
to acknowledge our neediness before the Lord.

184
00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:37.695
In fact, it's okay to acknowledge it before other people

185
00:10:38.245 --> 00:10:40.215
because it's true of all of us all the time.

186
00:10:40.215 --> 00:10:42.455
We're always needy, but, but it's okay to do that.

187
00:10:42.485 --> 00:10:46.255
It's only our pride that keeps us from doing that.

188
00:10:49.405 --> 00:10:53.825
But we can and we should carry our needs to the Lord,

189
00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:58.105
especially first because he already knows what they are.

190
00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:01.425
You're not informing him of something,

191
00:11:01.935 --> 00:11:03.745
reminding him, notifying him.

192
00:11:05.405 --> 00:11:07.465
You're not informing him. He already knows.

193
00:11:07.845 --> 00:11:11.345
And because he is the one who provides what you need,

194
00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:18.435
Just listen to what Jesus had to say about neediness.

195
00:11:19.785 --> 00:11:20.955
Matthew six.

196
00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:22.355
He says, therefore I tell you,

197
00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:25.835
do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat

198
00:11:25.975 --> 00:11:28.195
or what you will drink, nor about your body.

199
00:11:28.705 --> 00:11:31.555
What you'll put on is not life more than food

200
00:11:31.575 --> 00:11:33.035
and the body more than clothing.

201
00:11:34.155 --> 00:11:35.395
I mean, look at the birds of the air.

202
00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:38.275
They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns.

203
00:11:38.295 --> 00:11:40.755
And yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

204
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.995
Are you not of more value than they?

205
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.355
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour

206
00:11:48.415 --> 00:11:49.675
to his span of life?

207
00:11:50.455 --> 00:11:51.755
Why are you anxious about clothing?

208
00:11:52.355 --> 00:11:54.125
Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.

209
00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:55.685
They need their toil nor spin.

210
00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:58.565
Yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not

211
00:11:58.565 --> 00:11:59.565
arrayed like one of these.

212
00:12:00.785 --> 00:12:02.885
But if God so closed the grass in the field,

213
00:12:02.885 --> 00:12:05.325
which today is alive, tomorrow's thrown into the oven,

214
00:12:05.955 --> 00:12:07.725
will he not much more clothe you?

215
00:12:08.545 --> 00:12:11.545
Oh, you have little faith. Therefore,

216
00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:13.785
do not be anxious saying, what shall we eat?

217
00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:16.825
What shall we drink? What shall we wear for the Gentiles?

218
00:12:16.855 --> 00:12:18.025
Seek after all these things.

219
00:12:18.525 --> 00:12:20.945
Now, here it is, and your heavenly Father knows

220
00:12:20.945 --> 00:12:25.485
that you need them all, But seek first the kingdom of God

221
00:12:25.505 --> 00:12:26.565
and his righteousness

222
00:12:26.905 --> 00:12:30.445
and all these things will be added to you.

223
00:12:34.385 --> 00:12:35.805
Now, notice something about that.

224
00:12:36.025 --> 00:12:38.805
He never said he would provide all that you want,

225
00:12:41.265 --> 00:12:45.725
but he does promise that he will give us everything we need.

226
00:12:48.605 --> 00:12:52.015
Meaning, as you acknowledge your need,

227
00:12:53.435 --> 00:12:55.415
he provides your need for you.

228
00:12:57.705 --> 00:12:59.485
See, we can trust that God is our help

229
00:12:59.785 --> 00:13:02.165
and our deliverer, even when we are needy

230
00:13:03.195 --> 00:13:07.165
because we know his character and

231
00:13:07.165 --> 00:13:11.165
because like Second Corinthians 12 says, when we are weak,

232
00:13:13.295 --> 00:13:16.845
we're actually strong because it's his strength providing

233
00:13:16.905 --> 00:13:17.905
For us.

234
00:13:18.985 --> 00:13:20.245
We don't have to stay strong.

235
00:13:20.245 --> 00:13:21.485
We don't have to act like we're strong.

236
00:13:21.505 --> 00:13:24.285
We can be weak because he's strong for us.

237
00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:29.285
So we can call on the Lord as our help

238
00:13:29.285 --> 00:13:30.525
and our deliver even when we're

239
00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:32.325
needy, which is all the time.

240
00:13:34.345 --> 00:13:36.125
But also, there's a second piece here.

241
00:13:36.155 --> 00:13:37.445
Even when we are hurt

242
00:13:39.025 --> 00:13:41.405
and we learn from David that we call on him as our help

243
00:13:41.405 --> 00:13:42.565
and our deliverer, even when we're hurt,

244
00:13:45.995 --> 00:13:47.335
we see it in David's cry.

245
00:13:49.835 --> 00:13:51.585
Let's look at verses two and three again.

246
00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:53.985
He says, let them be put to shame

247
00:13:54.005 --> 00:13:57.425
and confusion who seek my life, let them be turned back

248
00:13:57.425 --> 00:13:59.785
and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.

249
00:14:00.085 --> 00:14:03.145
Let them turn back because of their shame. Who say, aha.

250
00:14:03.605 --> 00:14:06.105
Aha. So whatever the situation was,

251
00:14:06.405 --> 00:14:09.945
we know David had been extremely hurt by these people.

252
00:14:11.495 --> 00:14:13.345
Like they were literally trying to kill him.

253
00:14:14.695 --> 00:14:18.985
They were taking joy in his pain and

254
00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:21.065
and they said, aha, aha to him.

255
00:14:22.285 --> 00:14:23.705
Now I'm not talking about that nasty

256
00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:24.945
drink you get at Target.

257
00:14:25.095 --> 00:14:27.865
Okay? Like that's, that's not what this is referring to,

258
00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:32.065
which by the way, I'm an equal opportunity offender on that.

259
00:14:32.145 --> 00:14:33.185
I don't like any of the spark.

260
00:14:33.285 --> 00:14:36.545
So don't think I'm just picking on this one, But

261
00:14:36.545 --> 00:14:37.905
that was some, for some reason my

262
00:14:37.905 --> 00:14:38.945
mind went to that for the first one.

263
00:14:38.945 --> 00:14:42.945
I read this. But what that word in Hebrew means, aha.

264
00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:44.505
It's like a gotcha moment.

265
00:14:45.335 --> 00:14:48.585
It's like a, a mocking false accusation.

266
00:14:49.405 --> 00:14:51.765
I'm just delighting in your pain.

267
00:14:51.865 --> 00:14:53.485
That's what that word means.

268
00:14:56.985 --> 00:14:59.725
Now, don't you think David would've been deeply wounded

269
00:15:01.865 --> 00:15:05.485
by people who were doing these kind of things to him?

270
00:15:07.795 --> 00:15:12.055
Of course, like if not, he wouldn't be human.

271
00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:15.695
Because this is part of our normal experience in life

272
00:15:15.695 --> 00:15:18.935
that when we see people try to take our life,

273
00:15:19.725 --> 00:15:22.095
they laugh at our pain, they mock us.

274
00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:23.495
That's gonna hurt a little bit, right?

275
00:15:25.315 --> 00:15:26.415
In fact, it might hurt a lot,

276
00:15:30.655 --> 00:15:34.115
yet still in his pain

277
00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:37.095
as he's being hurt.

278
00:15:37.385 --> 00:15:38.655
Where did David turn?

279
00:15:40.495 --> 00:15:45.035
He turned to his God, he turned to Yahweh

280
00:15:45.035 --> 00:15:48.755
to the one that he saw as his help, as his deliverer.

281
00:15:48.755 --> 00:15:51.035
He said, God, you are still that.

282
00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:52.595
Do you think David was angry?

283
00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:54.555
I'm sure he was at this point

284
00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:57.195
because he's probably righteously angry.

285
00:15:57.195 --> 00:15:58.675
These people weren't just attacking him,

286
00:15:58.675 --> 00:15:59.955
they were opposing God.

287
00:16:00.175 --> 00:16:04.355
So he's probably feeling this angst and some anger in it,

288
00:16:04.455 --> 00:16:07.275
but still he took it to the Lord.

289
00:16:07.415 --> 00:16:12.395
He left it in God's hands. He didn't try to take revenge.

290
00:16:14.935 --> 00:16:17.355
He didn't try to take matters into his own hands.

291
00:16:17.655 --> 00:16:18.755
He said, what does he say?

292
00:16:19.095 --> 00:16:21.955
God, you deliver me God, you help me.

293
00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:25.715
You bring confusion in their minds. I can't do that.

294
00:16:27.655 --> 00:16:31.475
God, you turn them back in dishonor. I can't do that.

295
00:16:33.745 --> 00:16:35.635
Only you, God are my help

296
00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:40.655
and my delivery is

297
00:16:40.655 --> 00:16:42.015
that my perspective when I'm hurt,

298
00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:50.335
like do I immediately and fully take it to the Lord?

299
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:55.555
Or do I try to be my own, help my own deliverer?

300
00:16:58.675 --> 00:17:00.835
A lot of the things we do in our lives when we're hurt,

301
00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:06.195
we might claim that we're bringing justice.

302
00:17:08.465 --> 00:17:10.045
But I'm afraid that most of the things

303
00:17:10.045 --> 00:17:12.525
that we do come from a heart of vengeance,

304
00:17:14.665 --> 00:17:16.845
not from true righteous, ju justice.

305
00:17:20.995 --> 00:17:24.045
There's actually a powerful scene in David's life.

306
00:17:25.995 --> 00:17:27.605
It's in one Samuel 24.

307
00:17:27.605 --> 00:17:29.885
We're gonna start studying one Samuel this fall, but

308
00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:34.485
but the first king Saul, he was jealous

309
00:17:34.665 --> 00:17:36.725
of God's next king David,

310
00:17:38.745 --> 00:17:40.805
and he was hunting David in the

311
00:17:40.805 --> 00:17:42.045
wilderness to try to kill him.

312
00:17:44.835 --> 00:17:47.645
Well, it just so happened that one day David

313
00:17:47.745 --> 00:17:52.445
and his men were hiding very deep in a cave, and Saul

314
00:17:52.585 --> 00:17:57.405
and his men entered that cave to get out of the sun's heat.

315
00:18:00.295 --> 00:18:02.545
They didn't go as far back as David and his men were,

316
00:18:02.545 --> 00:18:04.905
but they were in this same cave.

317
00:18:04.905 --> 00:18:06.945
And I want you to listen to how this plays out.

318
00:18:08.495 --> 00:18:10.945
Keeping in mind what we just read in Psalm 70,

319
00:18:12.695 --> 00:18:14.905
this is one Samuel 24.

320
00:18:14.925 --> 00:18:17.065
It says, now, David and his men were sitting in the

321
00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:18.385
innermost parts of the cave.

322
00:18:18.845 --> 00:18:21.865
And the men of David said to himHe, is the day

323
00:18:21.865 --> 00:18:23.545
of which the Lord said to you, behold,

324
00:18:23.575 --> 00:18:25.145
I'll give your enemy into your hand.

325
00:18:25.445 --> 00:18:27.905
You shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.

326
00:18:28.845 --> 00:18:30.025
And David arose

327
00:18:30.205 --> 00:18:33.545
and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul's robe.

328
00:18:35.235 --> 00:18:37.575
And afterward David's heart struck him

329
00:18:37.845 --> 00:18:42.175
because he cut off a corner of Saul's robe And he said

330
00:18:42.175 --> 00:18:43.575
to his men, the Lord forbid

331
00:18:43.575 --> 00:18:45.495
that I should do this thing to my Lord.

332
00:18:45.555 --> 00:18:48.855
The Lord's anointed to put out my hand against him,

333
00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:50.695
seeing he is the Lord's anointed.

334
00:18:51.285 --> 00:18:52.775
Like David felt so guilty.

335
00:18:52.875 --> 00:18:54.975
And so David persuaded his men with these words,

336
00:18:55.115 --> 00:18:57.175
did not permit them to attack Saul.

337
00:18:58.485 --> 00:19:00.695
Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way.

338
00:19:00.715 --> 00:19:02.495
And afterward David also arose

339
00:19:02.555 --> 00:19:04.455
and went outta the cave, called

340
00:19:04.505 --> 00:19:06.815
after Saul, my Lord the king.

341
00:19:06.815 --> 00:19:09.535
And when Saul looked back behind him, David bowed

342
00:19:09.535 --> 00:19:11.575
with his face to the earth and paid homage.

343
00:19:12.355 --> 00:19:15.375
And David said to Saul, Hey, hey Saul.

344
00:19:15.395 --> 00:19:18.415
Why do you listen to the words of men who say, behold,

345
00:19:18.415 --> 00:19:19.735
David seeks your harm.

346
00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:23.615
Behold, this day, your eyes have seen

347
00:19:23.715 --> 00:19:26.855
how the Lord gave you today into my hand in the cave.

348
00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:29.655
Some told me to kill you, but I spared you.

349
00:19:31.655 --> 00:19:33.895
I said, I will not put out my hand against the Lord

350
00:19:34.115 --> 00:19:35.495
for he is the Lord's anointed.

351
00:19:35.635 --> 00:19:40.215
See my Father, see the corner of your robe in my hands for

352
00:19:40.215 --> 00:19:41.615
by the fact that I cut off the corner

353
00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:43.055
of your robe did not kill you.

354
00:19:43.435 --> 00:19:45.255
You may know and see that there's no wrong

355
00:19:45.255 --> 00:19:46.615
or treason in my hands.

356
00:19:46.845 --> 00:19:48.095
I've not sinned against you,

357
00:19:48.315 --> 00:19:50.615
though you hunt my life to take it.

358
00:19:52.715 --> 00:19:54.895
May the Lord judge between me and you.

359
00:19:55.515 --> 00:19:57.655
May the Lord avenge me against you,

360
00:19:58.075 --> 00:20:00.055
but my hand shall not be against you.

361
00:20:02.685 --> 00:20:04.305
May the Lord therefore be judged

362
00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:07.545
and give sentence between me and you and see to it

363
00:20:07.565 --> 00:20:11.585
and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand.

364
00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:13.345
You see that

365
00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:19.775
David was hunted by Saul.

366
00:20:20.155 --> 00:20:22.335
An army of 3000 men were coming

367
00:20:22.335 --> 00:20:24.055
after him to try to kill him.

368
00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:27.965
He was sent away from the city living on the run.

369
00:20:27.985 --> 00:20:30.485
And what did he do? David trusted God.

370
00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:36.865
He trusted God. He said to Saul,

371
00:20:37.055 --> 00:20:40.065
it's the Lord's job to judge between us.

372
00:20:41.815 --> 00:20:44.865
It's the Lord's job to bring vengeance.

373
00:20:45.895 --> 00:20:48.645
It's not my job to take you out, Saul. That's God's work.

374
00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:50.125
It's not my job to do that.

375
00:20:51.705 --> 00:20:56.175
He had a heart absent of vengeance against this man

376
00:20:56.175 --> 00:20:57.175
who was trying to kill him.

377
00:21:00.355 --> 00:21:04.015
Listen, it takes a mature trust to leave

378
00:21:04.885 --> 00:21:07.175
your hurt in God's hands

379
00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:12.015
to release your grip on it and and to give it to him.

380
00:21:12.075 --> 00:21:14.615
But if you see God as your help

381
00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:18.365
and your deliverer, that's how you can do that.

382
00:21:19.635 --> 00:21:23.065
David knew God's gonna take care of this. God's got this.

383
00:21:25.725 --> 00:21:26.725
I know I can release

384
00:21:27.395 --> 00:21:32.325
this, but here's the problem.

385
00:21:32.835 --> 00:21:35.565
That sounds easy. Of course we can do that.

386
00:21:35.825 --> 00:21:37.085
The problem comes whenever

387
00:21:37.085 --> 00:21:39.365
that resolution takes longer than we think it should.

388
00:21:43.765 --> 00:21:46.185
That's why the third aspect of Psalm 70 is

389
00:21:46.185 --> 00:21:47.945
that God is still our help

390
00:21:48.085 --> 00:21:50.785
and our deliverer, even when he seems delayed.

391
00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:56.105
We learned that from David in Psalm 70.

392
00:21:56.375 --> 00:22:00.145
Even when God seems delayed,

393
00:22:01.205 --> 00:22:03.465
he is our help and our deliverer.

394
00:22:05.745 --> 00:22:09.065
Remember how urgent David felt? Make haste. Hurry up.

395
00:22:09.445 --> 00:22:12.705
God, they're right here. I need you now.

396
00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:17.255
But it also felt to 'em that God was delayed,

397
00:22:17.255 --> 00:22:19.815
that somehow God was not gonna come through for him.

398
00:22:23.115 --> 00:22:24.975
Listen, maybe that's where you're at right now.

399
00:22:27.995 --> 00:22:29.305
Maybe you see it in your own life

400
00:22:30.695 --> 00:22:32.865
wondering if God's gonna resolve this

401
00:22:32.885 --> 00:22:34.225
or maybe see it in your kids' lives

402
00:22:34.285 --> 00:22:35.385
or you see it in your friends

403
00:22:35.485 --> 00:22:39.345
and like God, when when are you gonna come through for them?

404
00:22:44.255 --> 00:22:48.395
You see these struggles and it feels like God is absent

405
00:22:48.395 --> 00:22:50.435
because that's really what it feels like, doesn't it?

406
00:22:51.055 --> 00:22:54.395
It it, it feels like somehow God has clocked out of his job

407
00:22:54.775 --> 00:22:57.275
and he's moved on and he's just said, I'm, I'm done.

408
00:22:57.275 --> 00:22:58.955
Eight to five, I'm done. Right?

409
00:23:00.175 --> 00:23:01.835
And he's not even part of it anymore.

410
00:23:01.855 --> 00:23:03.315
And it feels like everything is out

411
00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:04.835
of control it feels like.

412
00:23:05.215 --> 00:23:06.395
Is that true though?

413
00:23:09.455 --> 00:23:11.915
Now theologically, we know that's not true,

414
00:23:13.775 --> 00:23:18.115
but experientially it can certainly feel that way, can it?

415
00:23:21.985 --> 00:23:26.795
This is how Psalm 44 says it awake,

416
00:23:27.495 --> 00:23:28.555
why are you sleeping?

417
00:23:29.015 --> 00:23:33.635
Oh Lord, rouse yourself. Do not reject us forever.

418
00:23:34.535 --> 00:23:35.875
Why do you hide your face?

419
00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:40.995
Why do you forget our affliction and our oppression?

420
00:23:42.905 --> 00:23:45.485
Like can't it feel like God's asleep at the wheel

421
00:23:47.425 --> 00:23:49.125
or that he's hiding himself from us

422
00:23:49.185 --> 00:23:51.485
or that he's even worse forgotten us?

423
00:23:54.105 --> 00:23:56.085
You look around at your life, the world is like God,

424
00:23:57.665 --> 00:23:58.925
I'm questioning whether you're even real.

425
00:24:02.735 --> 00:24:05.795
That's why we have to come back to the truths

426
00:24:06.335 --> 00:24:10.875
of God's character in His word, reminding us

427
00:24:11.935 --> 00:24:13.075
who he is, what he's done.

428
00:24:13.075 --> 00:24:14.595
This is why we come back to it.

429
00:24:14.695 --> 00:24:17.955
We come back to what we've seen in the Old Testament already

430
00:24:18.055 --> 00:24:22.115
in Psalm 23, this famous Psalm that David wrote says this,

431
00:24:22.175 --> 00:24:23.715
the Lord is my shepherd.

432
00:24:24.235 --> 00:24:27.395
I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures.

433
00:24:27.395 --> 00:24:30.875
He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul.

434
00:24:31.135 --> 00:24:33.835
He leads me in passive righteousness for his namesake.

435
00:24:34.305 --> 00:24:36.835
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

436
00:24:36.895 --> 00:24:40.875
of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.

437
00:24:42.505 --> 00:24:44.355
Your rod, your staff, they comfort me.

438
00:24:44.375 --> 00:24:47.035
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies,

439
00:24:47.295 --> 00:24:48.515
you anoint my head with oil.

440
00:24:48.575 --> 00:24:49.955
You my cup overflows.

441
00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:52.755
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days

442
00:24:52.775 --> 00:24:54.755
of my life and I shall dwell in the house

443
00:24:54.755 --> 00:24:55.835
of the Lord forever.

444
00:24:59.045 --> 00:25:03.185
Listen, if it feels like you're walking through the valley

445
00:25:03.965 --> 00:25:06.625
of the shadow of death, right?

446
00:25:06.625 --> 00:25:09.625
Those those are all dark language words

447
00:25:10.485 --> 00:25:12.545
and it feels like you're absent from God,

448
00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:14.065
it feels like he's gone from you.

449
00:25:14.065 --> 00:25:18.905
Listen, remember, if you are one of his sheep, then he is

450
00:25:19.135 --> 00:25:21.105
with you in the middle of all of it.

451
00:25:23.535 --> 00:25:26.625
Even if it seems like the darkness is lasting too long.

452
00:25:29.075 --> 00:25:31.175
If you are his sheep, he is your shepherd.

453
00:25:32.635 --> 00:25:34.015
And he never abandons his sheep.

454
00:25:36.825 --> 00:25:38.735
We've gotta go back to the promises

455
00:25:38.755 --> 00:25:41.175
of his character in Psalm 23.

456
00:25:41.405 --> 00:25:44.575
Even in Hebrews 13, verse five says,

457
00:25:44.895 --> 00:25:47.255
I will never leave you nor forsake you.

458
00:25:49.755 --> 00:25:51.365
He's not saying like, I'll leave you

459
00:25:51.365 --> 00:25:52.845
and forsake you at certain times.

460
00:25:53.015 --> 00:25:54.205
Right? I will never.

461
00:25:54.705 --> 00:25:56.725
And when God says, I will never do

462
00:25:56.725 --> 00:25:58.245
something, he will never do that.

463
00:25:59.945 --> 00:26:01.645
Not like you and me we're wishy-washy.

464
00:26:01.665 --> 00:26:04.445
He will never abandon his people.

465
00:26:09.045 --> 00:26:12.025
So again, even though it might feel like he is delayed,

466
00:26:14.795 --> 00:26:18.395
I heard it said this way, God is never late

467
00:26:19.635 --> 00:26:20.695
and he's rarely early.

468
00:26:23.265 --> 00:26:27.925
He is always exactly right on time, his time.

469
00:26:32.125 --> 00:26:33.265
So the Lord is our help

470
00:26:33.645 --> 00:26:36.545
and our deliver, even when we're needy, even when it hurts,

471
00:26:37.255 --> 00:26:38.825
even when it feels like he's delayed,

472
00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:41.145
he is our help and our deliverer.

473
00:26:41.145 --> 00:26:42.425
That's a glorious truth.

474
00:26:43.475 --> 00:26:46.405
Just to hang onto and to remind yourself

475
00:26:46.425 --> 00:26:47.845
and remind ourselves about,

476
00:26:50.715 --> 00:26:54.005
there's actually more here in Psalm 70 about who God is.

477
00:26:56.715 --> 00:26:57.845
When you look at Psalm 70,

478
00:26:57.905 --> 00:26:59.525
you look at verse four especially,

479
00:26:59.525 --> 00:27:00.645
and you see something else.

480
00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:04.805
You see that he is also our glory and our joy.

481
00:27:07.035 --> 00:27:09.525
He's our help and our deliverer. We saw that in verse five.

482
00:27:09.525 --> 00:27:12.885
Verse four says, he is our glory and our joy.

483
00:27:15.715 --> 00:27:18.045
Look again in verse four, he says, may all

484
00:27:18.145 --> 00:27:19.885
who seek you rejoice

485
00:27:20.345 --> 00:27:23.485
and be glad in you May those

486
00:27:23.485 --> 00:27:26.085
who love your salvation say evermore.

487
00:27:26.705 --> 00:27:28.325
God is great.

488
00:27:30.805 --> 00:27:33.945
He is our joy, the one who makes us glad,

489
00:27:35.605 --> 00:27:39.705
and he is our glory, the one who's worthy of us proclaiming

490
00:27:40.085 --> 00:27:42.985
and displaying how great our God really is.

491
00:27:43.055 --> 00:27:45.305
This is our joy and our glory,

492
00:27:47.785 --> 00:27:49.685
and we want those things, don't we?

493
00:27:51.595 --> 00:27:54.165
Like I could poll every Christian I've ever met,

494
00:27:55.115 --> 00:27:56.165
like we can walk around

495
00:27:56.185 --> 00:27:58.965
and talk to every Christian here anywhere else, and

496
00:27:58.965 --> 00:28:00.565
and we could ask them three questions.

497
00:28:02.905 --> 00:28:04.845
Do you want joy in God?

498
00:28:06.705 --> 00:28:09.005
Do you want to be glad in God?

499
00:28:10.305 --> 00:28:12.685
And and do you want to give glory to God?

500
00:28:15.315 --> 00:28:18.725
Universally yes to all of those, right?

501
00:28:19.555 --> 00:28:21.925
Like we want joy. We want to be glad in God.

502
00:28:21.925 --> 00:28:23.045
We want to give glory to God.

503
00:28:23.045 --> 00:28:25.245
That's part of being a Christian.

504
00:28:25.465 --> 00:28:27.365
But did you notice something about those

505
00:28:27.765 --> 00:28:30.125
questions here in verse four

506
00:28:31.365 --> 00:28:35.205
I, There were actually some conditions

507
00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:40.965
on getting those results, getting those outcomes

508
00:28:40.995 --> 00:28:42.245
that we want.

509
00:28:44.905 --> 00:28:48.405
May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.

510
00:28:49.745 --> 00:28:53.965
May those who love your salvation say evermore.

511
00:28:54.665 --> 00:28:59.155
God is great. So here's a

512
00:28:59.155 --> 00:29:00.355
couple questions I want to

513
00:29:01.855 --> 00:29:06.595
Ask Myself and us if we want those outcomes.

514
00:29:07.995 --> 00:29:09.195
A couple questions. Get us there.

515
00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:14.675
First, do we seek his presence?

516
00:29:21.645 --> 00:29:22.645
Do we seek

517
00:29:23.725 --> 00:29:24.725
His presence?

518
00:29:26.505 --> 00:29:27.905
I mean, what did David say?

519
00:29:29.725 --> 00:29:31.665
May all who seek you

520
00:29:33.225 --> 00:29:34.905
Rejoice and be glad in you.

521
00:29:37.525 --> 00:29:41.605
And so David knew that it was possible to have joy

522
00:29:42.065 --> 00:29:45.085
and gladness in God's presence,

523
00:29:45.465 --> 00:29:49.725
but he also knew that we have to seek the Lord to secure

524
00:29:49.795 --> 00:29:51.525
that joy and gladness.

525
00:29:54.625 --> 00:29:59.365
So do we. Do we seek

526
00:29:59.505 --> 00:30:04.085
an intimate relationship with him or,

527
00:30:04.105 --> 00:30:07.285
or do we instead just lament that we never feel close

528
00:30:07.285 --> 00:30:11.205
to him, that he feels absent from us?

529
00:30:14.595 --> 00:30:17.295
Now, let me be clear. There are times we know

530
00:30:17.295 --> 00:30:19.735
that the Lord allows us to go through dark nights

531
00:30:19.795 --> 00:30:22.015
of the soul through storms in our lives,

532
00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:24.695
even when we're seeking him, even when we're following Him.

533
00:30:24.915 --> 00:30:29.815
Yes, that happens. And

534
00:30:29.815 --> 00:30:32.895
there's also truth that sometimes our sin in our self

535
00:30:33.385 --> 00:30:34.455
hides God from us.

536
00:30:35.435 --> 00:30:37.535
He didn't go anywhere, but we walked away, right?

537
00:30:37.555 --> 00:30:40.655
So there's, so there's, there's parts of this that yes,

538
00:30:41.305 --> 00:30:44.495
we're gonna feel some of those realities,

539
00:30:44.635 --> 00:30:49.415
but often, often we don't

540
00:30:49.565 --> 00:30:52.495
feel close to him because we're not really pursuing him.

541
00:30:55.755 --> 00:30:58.485
That we treat God more like an accessory

542
00:30:58.545 --> 00:31:01.325
to our lives rather than the core of our lives

543
00:31:04.035 --> 00:31:05.725
that we're so distracted

544
00:31:07.185 --> 00:31:10.645
and we're more entertained by work

545
00:31:11.865 --> 00:31:14.645
or money or brawl stars or TikTok

546
00:31:15.145 --> 00:31:18.765
or whatever other things that we do, relationships,

547
00:31:18.905 --> 00:31:22.205
our bodies, we we're so distracted, so more entertained

548
00:31:22.305 --> 00:31:23.445
by those kind of things.

549
00:31:26.105 --> 00:31:28.525
And I wonder why I feel so dry at

550
00:31:28.525 --> 00:31:29.525
Times.

551
00:31:32.805 --> 00:31:36.335
Like I wonder why he feels far away at times.

552
00:31:39.855 --> 00:31:43.015
I wonder why I feel a lack of joy and gladness in him at

553
00:31:43.015 --> 00:31:44.015
Times.

554
00:31:47.465 --> 00:31:49.665
I wonder why my needs overwhelm me,

555
00:31:50.645 --> 00:31:54.825
why my hurts consume me while my,

556
00:31:54.825 --> 00:31:56.745
while my doubts rage against me.

557
00:31:56.745 --> 00:32:00.225
And I, I, I wonder about all those things I'm questioning,

558
00:32:01.465 --> 00:32:03.145
probably because I've sought my joy

559
00:32:03.205 --> 00:32:05.385
and my gladness in everything else

560
00:32:05.765 --> 00:32:06.765
But him.

561
00:32:11.725 --> 00:32:16.145
May all who seek you rejoice and be glad

562
00:32:16.145 --> 00:32:17.145
In you.

563
00:32:20.285 --> 00:32:22.185
And listen, even if that Spurgeon said this,

564
00:32:22.185 --> 00:32:24.145
even if it starts in the darkness,

565
00:32:27.815 --> 00:32:31.225
Hebrews 11 says that he rewards those who seek him.

566
00:32:34.155 --> 00:32:37.825
Light will come maybe not soon,

567
00:32:39.445 --> 00:32:42.385
but light will come even in the darkness.

568
00:32:46.365 --> 00:32:47.625
But here's the reality of that.

569
00:32:48.765 --> 00:32:52.345
In some ways, that first question

570
00:32:53.845 --> 00:32:58.745
is dependent on the second question, do we seek him?

571
00:32:58.925 --> 00:33:00.065
Do we seek his presence?

572
00:33:00.065 --> 00:33:01.345
Well, in some ways it's dependent

573
00:33:01.675 --> 00:33:03.345
again, directly from verse four.

574
00:33:03.655 --> 00:33:07.545
This second question, do we love his salvation?

575
00:33:11.485 --> 00:33:15.465
Do we seek him for joy, for gladness in our lives?

576
00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:19.085
But it kind of hinges on this one.

577
00:33:19.265 --> 00:33:21.125
Do you love his salvation?

578
00:33:22.225 --> 00:33:24.285
Now, David's talking about this immediate deliverance.

579
00:33:24.285 --> 00:33:25.445
His enemies are pressing in,

580
00:33:25.445 --> 00:33:27.525
and so he's like, God, I need you to get me outta here.

581
00:33:27.785 --> 00:33:30.165
He would've rejoiced at that salvation.

582
00:33:33.065 --> 00:33:36.085
But as great as that can be to be delivered from enemies

583
00:33:36.105 --> 00:33:38.845
to be delivered from hard situations, there's also

584
00:33:39.545 --> 00:33:42.605
the greater salvation that we can love eternally.

585
00:33:46.155 --> 00:33:47.725
It's what we talk about every week here.

586
00:33:48.635 --> 00:33:49.965
It's what we build our lives on.

587
00:33:49.965 --> 00:33:52.765
It's the gospel, good news, where Jesus

588
00:33:53.455 --> 00:33:57.085
lived the perfect law abiding life that we could not live

589
00:33:57.295 --> 00:33:58.805
where Jesus faced.

590
00:33:59.225 --> 00:34:03.125
You notice this in the, the story of the, the crucifixion.

591
00:34:03.335 --> 00:34:05.165
Jesus faced the same kind

592
00:34:05.165 --> 00:34:07.765
of ahas when he was crucified on the cross.

593
00:34:07.865 --> 00:34:11.365
People mocking him, looking at him falsely accusing him,

594
00:34:11.515 --> 00:34:13.365
that David felt in some ways,

595
00:34:13.695 --> 00:34:16.485
Jesus faced those same things while dying

596
00:34:16.745 --> 00:34:19.565
as our sin substitute on that cross.

597
00:34:19.865 --> 00:34:23.365
And then he rose again on the third day to defeat sin

598
00:34:23.385 --> 00:34:26.325
and death on that day that we couldn't do ourselves.

599
00:34:28.745 --> 00:34:32.485
See, that then leads to anyone

600
00:34:32.505 --> 00:34:36.445
who recognizes their sin against God, recognizes their need

601
00:34:36.465 --> 00:34:38.085
for Jesus' work in their place.

602
00:34:38.395 --> 00:34:41.965
What Jesus did means you can be saved from that sin.

603
00:34:44.905 --> 00:34:46.405
That's how the wrath of God

604
00:34:46.435 --> 00:34:51.285
that we deserve is transferred from them onto Christ.

605
00:34:51.505 --> 00:34:53.565
And what Christ does is he transfers his

606
00:34:53.565 --> 00:34:55.165
righteousness onto us.

607
00:34:56.145 --> 00:34:58.445
So we stand righteous before God forever.

608
00:35:01.425 --> 00:35:03.365
See, we call that the gospel, the good news.

609
00:35:04.665 --> 00:35:07.005
That's actually great news, isn't it?

610
00:35:11.105 --> 00:35:15.575
Do you love it? Do you

611
00:35:15.575 --> 00:35:16.655
love his salvation?

612
00:35:21.075 --> 00:35:25.055
If we do, if we truly love

613
00:35:25.595 --> 00:35:27.015
his salvation, then what?

614
00:35:27.135 --> 00:35:29.055
Verse four said here, he said,

615
00:35:29.055 --> 00:35:31.855
then we will forever say something.

616
00:35:32.045 --> 00:35:35.215
What did he say? You'll forevermore forever. Say what?

617
00:35:35.755 --> 00:35:40.645
God is. Great Again.

618
00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:44.485
Do we like, do we do?

619
00:35:44.485 --> 00:35:48.005
We so deeply love the salvation

620
00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:50.645
that Jesus offers us that I can't help

621
00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:53.365
but declare everywhere I go that God is great.

622
00:35:55.625 --> 00:35:58.525
His greatness in his sovereignty, his character,

623
00:35:58.665 --> 00:36:02.725
his provision for me, his greatness in his work, in my place

624
00:36:03.185 --> 00:36:07.165
for salvation, his great promises of eternity

625
00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:08.965
with him forever and ever in the new heavens

626
00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:11.005
and like the greatness of God

627
00:36:12.475 --> 00:36:14.005
because of his salvation.

628
00:36:14.465 --> 00:36:17.125
Do you love his salvation?

629
00:36:20.615 --> 00:36:22.125
Maybe a better question is this.

630
00:36:25.485 --> 00:36:29.635
Would those who know you best agree

631
00:36:30.705 --> 00:36:33.475
that the thing you love the most is salvation?

632
00:36:34.605 --> 00:36:39.395
Jesus, that's a little

633
00:36:39.395 --> 00:36:40.555
harder question, isn't it?

634
00:36:43.175 --> 00:36:46.085
Would those who know you best agree that that's

635
00:36:46.085 --> 00:36:48.165
what you love the most in your life?

636
00:36:50.595 --> 00:36:52.535
Or is it anything else?

637
00:36:55.785 --> 00:36:58.605
If it is anything else, that is the very definition

638
00:36:58.785 --> 00:36:59.925
of an idol,

639
00:37:05.045 --> 00:37:07.825
but I hope we see it today, church, I hope I see it more.

640
00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:10.105
I hope we see it more church, that there is nothing

641
00:37:10.855 --> 00:37:12.025
more fulfilling.

642
00:37:12.175 --> 00:37:14.225
There's nothing more satisfying.

643
00:37:14.375 --> 00:37:17.225
There's nothing more thrilling than a close

644
00:37:18.025 --> 00:37:20.385
intimate relationship with the God of the universe

645
00:37:20.385 --> 00:37:21.665
through Jesus Christ.

646
00:37:24.565 --> 00:37:26.065
Do you see how good he is

647
00:37:26.175 --> 00:37:28.145
that he would never leave his children,

648
00:37:28.475 --> 00:37:33.385
never forsake his people, never abandon us in any situation

649
00:37:33.455 --> 00:37:36.465
that he would do all that he did to save us?

650
00:37:36.845 --> 00:37:38.505
How great is our God?

651
00:37:42.505 --> 00:37:44.205
So here's what we're gonna do. I wanna invite the worship

652
00:37:44.205 --> 00:37:47.125
leaders to come back out now to help us lead toward exactly

653
00:37:47.125 --> 00:37:49.605
what this passage just said we're supposed to do.

654
00:37:52.585 --> 00:37:55.885
By the way, did you notice we were led first part

655
00:37:55.885 --> 00:37:57.325
of this service by a choir?

656
00:38:00.025 --> 00:38:03.325
What's the heading of verse 70 to the choir master, right?

657
00:38:03.325 --> 00:38:06.125
What does it say to the choir master?

658
00:38:08.755 --> 00:38:11.125
Well, David wrote this so that

659
00:38:11.705 --> 00:38:13.285
the body could sing it together.

660
00:38:13.465 --> 00:38:16.805
Now, this is not the only choir here today, right?

661
00:38:19.105 --> 00:38:22.405
We are the choir, right?

662
00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:28.845
Every week we are the choir singing the truths

663
00:38:28.845 --> 00:38:30.205
of God's word.

664
00:38:30.355 --> 00:38:33.525
That means we are to sing these things together.

665
00:38:34.745 --> 00:38:36.645
Here's the interesting thing, uh, Joe said this

666
00:38:36.665 --> 00:38:39.485
during the week, this, this to the choir master,

667
00:38:39.485 --> 00:38:40.605
meaning it's corporate.

668
00:38:40.715 --> 00:38:43.085
Look at all the I and me language throughout this.

669
00:38:45.275 --> 00:38:48.485
Like he, he's saying, you all should sing this,

670
00:38:48.485 --> 00:38:51.045
but use singular language, first person.

671
00:38:51.075 --> 00:38:53.805
Like what that means simply is

672
00:38:53.805 --> 00:38:55.565
that we are all in this together.

673
00:38:58.265 --> 00:38:59.365
We can sing this together

674
00:38:59.365 --> 00:39:00.565
because we're all in this together.

675
00:39:02.225 --> 00:39:04.245
And so again, in light of his goodness

676
00:39:04.985 --> 00:39:08.205
in salvation especially, here's what Psalm 30,

677
00:39:09.255 --> 00:39:10.565
David wrote this as well.

678
00:39:11.545 --> 00:39:13.925
Here's how it describes how our response should be.

679
00:39:15.665 --> 00:39:18.885
You have turned for me, my mourning into dancing.

680
00:39:20.605 --> 00:39:24.585
You have loosed my sackcloth, clothed me with gladness.

681
00:39:26.375 --> 00:39:31.185
That my glory may sing your praise and not be silent.

682
00:39:32.885 --> 00:39:36.185
Oh Lord, my God, I will give thanks to you forever.
