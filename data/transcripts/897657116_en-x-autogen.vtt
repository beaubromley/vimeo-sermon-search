00:00:01.175 --> 00:00:02.765
Jamie Authorities say this is now

2
00:00:02.845 --> 00:00:03.965
a criminal investigation.

3
00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:06.045
Several fires raging.

4
00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:08.005
Now down this street, smashing,

5
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:09.925
grab flash mob at a Nordstrom,

6
00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:15.085
Took Police the number

7
00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:16.125
of homeless people on the streets

8
00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.725
and in shelter, medical treatment for minors,

9
00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:21.885
which has surprise attack within Israel's borders.

10
00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:24.845
People are for a

11
00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.015
And an angel of the Lord appeared to them

12
00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:51.295
and the glory of the Lord shown around them,

13
00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:52.855
and they were filled with fear.

14
00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:56.335
And the angel said to them, fear not for behold.

15
00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:59.095
I bring you good news of great joy.

16
00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:09.735
Good news of great joy. Yeah. What a phrase, right?

17
00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.775
I I think we all need some of that right now, don't we?

18
00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:16.735
Some good news. Uh, I think we could all long for

19
00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:20.495
that great joy, that sense of deep abiding joy.

20
00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:22.615
Of course, we need that.

21
00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.575
Well, that's what we've been focused on the last few

22
00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:28.775
Sundays, is we've looked at this scene from 2000 years ago

23
00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:32.495
where we celebrate what we call the incarnation, which is

24
00:01:33.115 --> 00:01:36.895
God the Son, taking on flesh to be with his people

25
00:01:37.845 --> 00:01:40.575
full of grace and truth dwelling among us.

26
00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:42.015
Now, here's the backstory to that.

27
00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.375
For thousands of years, God's people had been

28
00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:45.415
waiting for something.

29
00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:48.615
They had been waiting and longing for the Messiah,

30
00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:50.855
for the savior, for the deliverer to come.

31
00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:54.655
God had promised to send him, and they were waiting for it.

32
00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:56.695
Yet, what they didn't fully realize was that

33
00:01:56.925 --> 00:02:01.135
that savior was coming not merely as a political messiah

34
00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:04.895
or a, uh, a physical social messiah.

35
00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:06.415
He was coming primarily first

36
00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:08.455
and foremost as a spiritual messiah.

37
00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:11.815
And as he changed hearts,

38
00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:14.895
his kingdom values would then show up in the

39
00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:16.015
world around them.

40
00:02:18.265 --> 00:02:20.365
But to a group of oppressed

41
00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:23.205
and seemingly forgotten people back then,

42
00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:26.805
that would've been good news of great joy, right?

43
00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:30.485
That he was not only coming, but he had come.

44
00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:33.675
But it's just as true for us today.

45
00:02:35.295 --> 00:02:38.435
See, I know that Christmas is often characterized as a,

46
00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:42.915
a joy-filled, happy time filled with lights

47
00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:46.555
and presents and hallmark movies and, and sugar plums.

48
00:02:46.785 --> 00:02:48.675
Like I don't even know what a sugar plum is.

49
00:02:48.745 --> 00:02:50.515
Anybody tell whatever that is.

50
00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:53.675
But, but that's what we kind of project out

51
00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:55.595
and culture demands of us.

52
00:02:55.615 --> 00:03:00.095
But what I know from my story is that many

53
00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:04.815
of us walk in here today with, with some pain, uh, with some

54
00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:08.415
feeling of sadness, with some oppression, maybe with,

55
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.615
with whatever feeling of being outcast.

56
00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:12.895
You might feel a forgottenness in your life

57
00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:14.255
that you have felt.

58
00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:21.755
Plus many of our eyes have succumbed to the constant cycle

59
00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:24.435
of seemingly bad news that we see on social media

60
00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:26.835
and on the news stations.

61
00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:29.835
And, and we see that and, and we think that's all there is.

62
00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:36.035
That's why we need good news of great joy just as much

63
00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:39.715
as anyone else does, just as much as they did back then,

64
00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:43.475
which is thankfully exactly what the angel said

65
00:03:43.855 --> 00:03:45.435
to the shepherds on that night.

66
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:49.995
Luke 10, Luke two 10 says, fear not for behold.

67
00:03:50.155 --> 00:03:53.395
I bring you good news of great joy that will be

68
00:03:53.815 --> 00:03:55.115
for all the people.

69
00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:58.795
All the people, us too.

70
00:04:00.235 --> 00:04:02.525
Good news of great joy.

71
00:04:03.545 --> 00:04:07.485
So what I wanna do for a few minutes is focus on, on

72
00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:11.965
what the angels said to the shepherds that night.

73
00:04:12.355 --> 00:04:15.325
What was their perspective on the Messiah's arrival?

74
00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:18.045
But I also want us to consider those shepherds a little

75
00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:19.805
bit towards the end.

76
00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:22.325
'cause I think we can be encouraged by what God chose

77
00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.805
to do there and why he did what he did.

78
00:04:25.735 --> 00:04:29.755
And so first, again, notice what the angels said as he came

79
00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:32.395
to the shepherds announcing Jesus' birth.

80
00:04:32.395 --> 00:04:34.195
Listen to what the angel said.

81
00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:38.675
Behold, I bring you good news. Fear not I.

82
00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:41.155
Behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be

83
00:04:41.155 --> 00:04:44.635
for all the people, for unto you is born this day in the

84
00:04:44.635 --> 00:04:47.595
city of David, a savior who is Christ the Lord.

85
00:04:48.415 --> 00:04:50.075
And this will be a sign for you.

86
00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:52.995
You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling costs,

87
00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:55.075
lying in a manger.

88
00:04:57.485 --> 00:05:01.105
Now, that was not only from the one angel, as he showed up

89
00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:02.745
to these shepherds, the, the curtain

90
00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:06.625
of the heavens splits open and this shining one enters in

91
00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:09.585
and says this to the shepherds.

92
00:05:09.765 --> 00:05:12.625
But then a multitude of angels appeared

93
00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:16.495
shining like stars praising God.

94
00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:19.175
And here's what they said. You heard the choir sing it.

95
00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:20.895
Glory to God in the highest

96
00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:25.855
and on earth, peace among those with whom he is pleased.

97
00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:30.475
Now, just stop for a second.

98
00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:35.395
Can you imagine being in that field like

99
00:05:35.415 --> 00:05:36.995
how overwhelmed you would be?

100
00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:41.475
You're in the dark, you're in the quiet, bleeding sheep

101
00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:44.155
around you, and it's totally silent,

102
00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:47.595
and all of a sudden the heavens split

103
00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:49.515
and light shines

104
00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:53.115
and you hear these amazing, overwhelming,

105
00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:54.875
deafening truths.

106
00:05:57.695 --> 00:06:00.515
But this was how God chose

107
00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:03.395
to declare his son's earthly birth

108
00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:09.475
to a few smelly shepherds in an empty field outside

109
00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:10.995
of a tiny town in Bethlehem.

110
00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:16.145
Like that's, that's stunning, first

111
00:06:16.165 --> 00:06:18.105
and foremost, that God would choose to do it that way.

112
00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:19.865
We'll talk again here in a second about that.

113
00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:23.425
But, but what did God say through the angels?

114
00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:26.345
Well, first he said, don't be afraid.

115
00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:29.145
I don't know about you, but if I was in that moment,

116
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:31.425
I would be terrified of what just happened.

117
00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:35.065
It seems like every time in scripture that an angel shows up

118
00:06:35.065 --> 00:06:38.225
to a person, they have to say, don't be afraid, right?

119
00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:42.865
'cause you would be, But why?

120
00:06:43.405 --> 00:06:45.745
Notice he says, why don't be afraid. Why?

121
00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:49.945
Because I bring you good news of great joy

122
00:06:49.945 --> 00:06:51.265
that will be for all the people.

123
00:06:53.565 --> 00:06:55.225
Now, thankfully he explains the good news

124
00:06:55.245 --> 00:06:56.545
or else we wouldn't know what it is.

125
00:06:56.725 --> 00:07:01.665
The good news is that unto you, meaning for you, given

126
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.225
as a Christmas present to you,

127
00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:07.465
you might say A savior has been born in David's city,

128
00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:09.985
Bethlehem, David's hometown.

129
00:07:10.135 --> 00:07:13.465
That goes back to the legacy of the generations.

130
00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:16.385
And it says, that's not just any baby that's born there,

131
00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:19.865
the Savior, but that's the Christ, the Messiah,

132
00:07:19.865 --> 00:07:20.985
the one you've been waiting for,

133
00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:24.425
the promised one from ages past, fulfilling the prophecies.

134
00:07:24.765 --> 00:07:27.545
He is born and he's the Lord already.

135
00:07:29.885 --> 00:07:31.825
That's one of the the,

136
00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:34.385
when you think about the Christmas carols we sing, you need

137
00:07:34.385 --> 00:07:36.585
to deeply think about those lyrics.

138
00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:38.945
We're gonna sing one here in a moment

139
00:07:38.965 --> 00:07:40.665
as we light these candles.

140
00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:42.745
It's a familiar one. You might have missed it,

141
00:07:42.965 --> 00:07:46.385
but it says Jesus Lord at thy birth.

142
00:07:48.805 --> 00:07:50.185
That's what this is talking about.

143
00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:53.295
Meaning he already was,

144
00:07:53.435 --> 00:07:57.605
he always has been the Lord at his birth.

145
00:07:57.665 --> 00:07:59.205
It means he already was.

146
00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:02.085
I love how HB Charles a, a preacher in Florida, he put

147
00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:05.885
that idea, he said, many babies have become king.

148
00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:10.665
Only once has a king become a baby.

149
00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:17.615
The king already was the Lord. He became a baby.

150
00:08:17.635 --> 00:08:19.815
And if the shepherds had any question about any of this,

151
00:08:19.945 --> 00:08:21.015
which you can imagine,

152
00:08:21.015 --> 00:08:22.295
they would've been a little overwhelmed.

153
00:08:22.315 --> 00:08:23.615
But if they had any question about this,

154
00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:27.335
the angel gave them a sign, a proof, an action

155
00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:29.815
that would validate the claims about someone.

156
00:08:30.155 --> 00:08:32.215
So they say, here's what you need to do.

157
00:08:32.475 --> 00:08:35.415
Follow God's leading to find this baby,

158
00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:38.855
lying in a feeding trough, wrapped in strips of fabric.

159
00:08:38.965 --> 00:08:40.535
They called s swaddling colos.

160
00:08:43.165 --> 00:08:45.425
Here's why they said that, because just up in verse seven,

161
00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:49.025
you saw it happen here, illustrated.

162
00:08:49.205 --> 00:08:52.345
She gave birth, Mary gave birth to her firstborn son,

163
00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:55.805
wrapped him in swaddling cloths, laid him in a manger

164
00:08:55.995 --> 00:08:58.405
because there was no place for them in the end

165
00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:04.165
again, only one angel said all that to the shepherds.

166
00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.325
But then so many showed up,

167
00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:08.205
this heavenly choir showed up again singing

168
00:09:08.205 --> 00:09:10.125
what verse 14 said, glory to God

169
00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:12.485
and the highest on earth peace among those

170
00:09:12.515 --> 00:09:14.285
with whom he's pleased.

171
00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:17.845
So this, this baby, this Lord Christ, he is the Savior,

172
00:09:18.265 --> 00:09:19.285
the prince of peace.

173
00:09:19.345 --> 00:09:21.645
Isaiah nine predicted 700 years earlier.

174
00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:23.845
This is the baby born to us.

175
00:09:24.145 --> 00:09:27.125
And he gives peace as God pleases.

176
00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:34.065
Okay? So here's the question. How do we get that peace

177
00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:37.235
that he is bringing?

178
00:09:38.185 --> 00:09:41.795
Because in our sin, every one of us, we are God's enemies.

179
00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:43.795
He's a holy God. We're not so, we are his,

180
00:09:44.015 --> 00:09:45.235
uh, his opposition.

181
00:09:45.415 --> 00:09:48.435
You might say his enemies. And so how do we get that peace?

182
00:09:48.435 --> 00:09:50.155
Well, Romans five, one answers the question,

183
00:09:52.245 --> 00:09:56.035
since we have been justified by faith, we have peace

184
00:09:56.145 --> 00:09:59.155
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

185
00:10:00.325 --> 00:10:01.815
Alright? Do you notice the conditions?

186
00:10:03.865 --> 00:10:06.635
It's through our Lord Jesus Christ.

187
00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:10.545
That means you cannot have peace with God

188
00:10:11.165 --> 00:10:14.465
by your own efforts, by climbing up a ladder

189
00:10:14.485 --> 00:10:16.185
of good works to get to God.

190
00:10:16.285 --> 00:10:17.545
You can't make it.

191
00:10:17.615 --> 00:10:20.265
It's only through his perfect life, death

192
00:10:20.525 --> 00:10:24.145
and resurrection in your place that you put your trust,

193
00:10:24.215 --> 00:10:28.505
your faith, your eternal hope in what he has done for you.

194
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:35.105
That's then when he justifies you,

195
00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.985
meaning he makes you right before God.

196
00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:42.255
He takes enemy separated

197
00:10:42.355 --> 00:10:44.535
and he says, no, now you are a friend.

198
00:10:45.075 --> 00:10:48.135
As if you'd lived Christ perfect life yourself.

199
00:10:48.435 --> 00:10:50.775
He makes you a beloved child.

200
00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:55.605
That's what he does by faith.

201
00:10:58.095 --> 00:10:59.675
Listen, if you're, if you're here

202
00:11:00.845 --> 00:11:03.505
and you don't have the assurance that you have that kind

203
00:11:03.505 --> 00:11:07.355
of peace with God, Don't leave today.

204
00:11:07.355 --> 00:11:09.475
Please come talk to one of us up here at the front as soon

205
00:11:09.475 --> 00:11:11.155
as we're done, or somebody you came with

206
00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:12.835
and say, I don't, I don't know if I have that.

207
00:11:14.435 --> 00:11:15.535
We would love to talk with you.

208
00:11:15.555 --> 00:11:17.855
Be honored to talk with you about that.

209
00:11:21.015 --> 00:11:22.835
And so, so that's the angel's perspective,

210
00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:25.155
the heavenly perspective on the Messiah.

211
00:11:25.155 --> 00:11:26.155
But I also wanna take a moment

212
00:11:26.155 --> 00:11:27.515
and think about those shepherds.

213
00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:34.895
See, God could have sent those angels to anyone.

214
00:11:37.615 --> 00:11:40.675
He could have announced it to the kings and the palaces.

215
00:11:42.915 --> 00:11:44.455
He could have showed up at the temple

216
00:11:44.755 --> 00:11:46.615
to the religious leaders who'd been

217
00:11:46.975 --> 00:11:48.055
supposedly following God.

218
00:11:48.055 --> 00:11:49.495
And he could have announced it there.

219
00:11:49.595 --> 00:11:52.655
He could have gone to this massive crowd in Jerusalem,

220
00:11:53.285 --> 00:11:55.925
gathered, had he could have said, here's the Messiah.

221
00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:03.965
Who did the angels come to though to the shepherds,

222
00:12:05.385 --> 00:12:09.005
to the ones walking in the darkness of the night,

223
00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:12.285
but also who were walking in the darkness of society.

224
00:12:14.245 --> 00:12:18.665
He came to the least of the least to the last and the least.

225
00:12:18.845 --> 00:12:20.385
He came to them.

226
00:12:20.445 --> 00:12:22.505
And we could imagine all kinds of reasons why.

227
00:12:24.005 --> 00:12:27.345
But I love what one author wrote about why she believes God

228
00:12:27.355 --> 00:12:29.945
chose to announce the birth first to these men.

229
00:12:33.365 --> 00:12:37.265
The Bethlehem Shepherds did not deconstruct the glory

230
00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:38.825
that they were chosen to witness.

231
00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:42.895
You might imagine. This is what she says.

232
00:12:43.605 --> 00:12:45.895
Shouldn't the Savior be born into wealth?

233
00:12:48.825 --> 00:12:51.385
I mean, did the angels really mean a manger?

234
00:12:54.245 --> 00:12:57.145
No, they carried not their doubts,

235
00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:02.225
but their wonder to the baby, offering joy,

236
00:13:02.685 --> 00:13:07.005
not speculation, received, they received the gift

237
00:13:07.035 --> 00:13:09.085
with no contingencies.

238
00:13:13.555 --> 00:13:14.975
See, that's what God's looking for.

239
00:13:17.275 --> 00:13:19.585
God's looking for those of us who recognize

240
00:13:19.935 --> 00:13:24.185
that we need Him, who are in awe of God,

241
00:13:24.185 --> 00:13:26.345
that he would do something so gracious.

242
00:13:26.565 --> 00:13:30.625
For those of us who are so sinful, he's looking for those

243
00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:33.025
who know that they don't have it all together.

244
00:13:33.195 --> 00:13:36.785
Those who know that they're not always in the circle, those

245
00:13:36.785 --> 00:13:39.785
who are beyond the places of power, those

246
00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:43.865
who have messy lives, those

247
00:13:43.925 --> 00:13:46.985
who are sitting in the darkened fields of life

248
00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:50.865
with their eyes lifted, listening for the heavenly song.

249
00:13:53.715 --> 00:13:57.885
Listen, if that's you today, if that's you today,

250
00:13:57.885 --> 00:14:00.205
hear me, God sees you.

251
00:14:02.745 --> 00:14:05.605
God sees you, God still comes for you.

252
00:14:05.875 --> 00:14:09.745
Even now, even here,

253
00:14:11.055 --> 00:14:13.745
this heavenly song still

254
00:14:14.365 --> 00:14:19.275
echoes in the darkness, in our darkness.

255
00:14:21.745 --> 00:14:23.335
Glory to God, in the highest

256
00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:26.855
and on earth, peace among those with whom he's pleased.

257
00:14:26.955 --> 00:14:31.505
So this Christmas, Let's not get so wrapped up

258
00:14:32.125 --> 00:14:34.745
in what the world is trying to sell us

259
00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:40.015
and miss what God is trying to give us.

260
00:14:43.295 --> 00:14:45.875
The Savior came to bring us home.
