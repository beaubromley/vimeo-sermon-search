1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:08.800
I get so much restoration say something

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.400
I'm giving up on you.

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.200
I'll be the

4
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.500
one if you want me to.

5
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.900
Anywhere, I would follow

6
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.200
you.

7
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.800
Say something.

8
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.700
somebody

9
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.400
else to

10
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.800
start

11
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.700
you are

12
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.100
You saying good?

13
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.700
Something I'm Giving

14
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.300
Up

15
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.600
I'll be that one.

16
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.100
if you want me to

17
00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.600
say

18
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.900
something

19
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.700
I'm giving up on you.

20
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.600
you

21
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.400
Okay.

22
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.300
Say Something I'm Giving Up

23
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.000
well

24
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.700
See some people are.

25
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.200
scheduling counseling appointments

26
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.000
I don't know. Maybe they're not. Maybe they're just finding water. I don't

27
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.100
know.

28
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.600
so I want you to

29
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.500
kind of take that song in you guys have

30
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.700
probably some of you probably heard that.

31
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.000
before

32
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.000
but I'm curious if you've ever felt that way.

33
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.100
You ever thought that way in your relationship?

34
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.600
I want you to take note.

35
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.100
Kind of if you were listening to it.

36
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.900
And kind of what was coming up what was happening for you

37
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.800
on the inside?

38
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.000
What feelings were there right just kind of

39
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.400
taking the experience it's because we're going to talk about that here in

40
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.900
a few minutes

41
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.700
It's a pretty powerful.

42
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.200
so as I said in our first session

43
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.300
we were designed to be intimately connected. That's the

44
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.300
way God has designed us.

45
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.000
And for most of us, you know in the beginning.

46
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.900
The beginning of our relationship that's pretty easy.

47
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.200
Right. We've we really don't have much to lose and I have

48
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.400
nothing to lose. We have everything to gain in our new relationships.

49
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.900
During that time.

50
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.600
It's typically easier to be a little more open with each other a

51
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.200
little more connected with each other, right? Y'all can remember

52
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.100
look back to your relationship. It was it was

53
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.600
much easier.

54
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.400
right we

55
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.000
connected with one another

56
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.300
we

57
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.100
look at each other's eyes.

58
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.200
right we

59
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.100
Answer each other's calls nowadays. It's texts emails

60
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.200
those kinds of things. We do all that.

61
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.900
We're attentive.

62
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.300
more responsive to one another

63
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.700
during those times and generally we

64
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.100
just like to be around each other.

65
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.300
right

66
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.300
But as time goes on

67
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.000
And life takes over.

68
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.500
Disconnecting from each other will happen

69
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.600
and can happen without us ever noticing

70
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.700
it.

71
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.200
Our level of attendant attentiveness and our level

72
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.200
of responsiveness just kind of drop off

73
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.900
slowly.

74
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.600
And over time the more challenging it becomes

75
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.300
to open up with each other.

76
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.700
I'm sad and I need comfort.

77
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.400
But I show her by withdrawing and being

78
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.800
quiet.

79
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.500
She sees this.

80
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.700
And she leaves me alone because she doesn't want to upset me.

81
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.200
or

82
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.200
she's worried about something. It doesn't matter what it is. She's worried

83
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.600
about something.

84
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.300
But she shows me anger.

85
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.300
So I avoid her.

86
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.000
So it's not to cause an argument.

87
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.600
These moments in our marriage are truly unavoidable.

88
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.500
And it's during these times when the arguments occur that the

89
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.500
enemy intensifies his attacks on us.

90
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.200
So in this last session tonight, I want us to

91
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.500
kind of answer the question what happened to us?

92
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.100
What happened to all of that what happened to the

93
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.800
connection that we once felt?

94
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.000
How did the security that we had in each other

95
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.900
just vanish?

96
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.600
Why does she no longer see me

97
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.800
as her hero?

98
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.400
Why does he no longer want to sit and talk with

99
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.500
me about his day?

100
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.200
Why cannot why can I not make her happy?

101
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.500
Why can I not make him love me?

102
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.300
These questions are really at the

103
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.200
heart of disconnection.

104
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.000
But ones that we cannot ask each other because it's

105
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.100
it doesn't feel safe to do

106
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.600
so anymore.

107
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.300
No longer feels safe to be that vulnerable with

108
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.900
you losing our connection with each

109
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.600
other sets off major alarm

110
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.100
Bells.

111
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.400
Think about the baby.

112
00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.000
losing connection with Mom

113
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.400
all of a sudden alarm Bells go off. That's what happens

114
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.700
to us. Our sense of security is threatened.

115
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.900
Right? Relationally. It's threatened.

116
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.200
Sue Johnson I said talk about earlier she refers to

117
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.100
this as a primal panic.

118
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.400
And it occurs in our amygdala.

119
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.300
Too little Walnut shaped organs

120
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.300
in the middle of our brain. It's our fear Center.

121
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.300
Where all of our fears all these fears kind

122
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.300
of our noticed.

123
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.100
We sense danger of All Sorts, right? We have

124
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.400
a dog have ever seen the hair on the back of your dog's neck stand

125
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.200
up. Right? It's the amygdala and dog. It's

126
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.800
going up right here we get.

127
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.900
chills you have

128
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.000
A clown running at you with a hatchet and what happens right?

129
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.600
That that right there that's alarm Bells that's good. I was

130
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.400
designed we're supposed to we're not supposed to go. Hey, excuse me.

131
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.000
It looks like you're in a hurry. We're not supposed to do that. We're supposed

132
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.400
to either get ready to fight or

133
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.300
Run, that's what the alarm bells are. It's our

134
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.900
Panic system very natural.

135
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.800
So come along those lines I often use in my

136
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.900
office off and use the example of a snake or a stick.

137
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.100
Right if you ever walk along the path.

138
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.000
And you see something that even vaguely resembles a

139
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.400
snake.

140
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.100
The accuracy of your assessment in that moment.

141
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.900
Is not of importance, right? What's

142
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.000
important in that moment?

143
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:28.800
speed

144
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.900
right, whoa

145
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.200
It's got you got to get back. You got to

146
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.200
get back when we're in danger. We were not designed to

147
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.800
think we were designed to act.

148
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.400
Touch a hot stove, you know, this is kind of hot. I should

149
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.000
probably take my hand off or I'm gonna end up in the emergency room for a

150
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.200
little while.

151
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.800
We don't process like that. We feel it.

152
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.100
Oh and we pull away that fast

153
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.900
just like that, baby.

154
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.800
Just like that, baby.

155
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.800
So the fear doesn't only come from on the outside right?

156
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.200
It's not just you know, snake or whatever that kind

157
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.700
of thing or stick. It. It don't it doesn't always come from the outside. Sometimes

158
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.600
it comes from the inside.

159
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.000
So you've probably heard it said before that perception is

160
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.700
what's important not reality,

161
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.900
right? You probably all heard that.

162
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.200
When we're in need and nobody is there for

163
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.700
us we feel abandoned in that moment. We are

164
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.400
set up to enter.

165
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.400
A pain this is that anything that I was telling

166
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.500
you about at the end of the first session.

167
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.200
This anything is an attempt to

168
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:42.600
survive.

169
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.100
It's a protest over the emotional disconnection right

170
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.300
go back to the baby. It's what happened to

171
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:49.900
her.

172
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.400
She felt that disconnection curious. What's

173
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.500
happening. Try to get Mom's she's doing that.

174
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.700
All right.

175
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.800
Excuse me. So under all the distress.

176
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.400
It's it's this protest under all

177
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.300
the distress and the arguing in

178
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.200
the in the yelling. We simply want to

179
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.500
know.

180
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.200
You you simply want to know we all simply want

181
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.700
to know is your spouse there for you?

182
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.400
You want to know that she needs you?

183
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.600
You want to know that?

184
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.500
You can get to him.

185
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.100
You want to know that he'll show up for you?

186
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.300
in those moments when we

187
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.000
need each other we all have those moments.

188
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.800
So it's what we do next.

189
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.700
That's really important.

190
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.800
Can we ask to be cared for?

191
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.600
Can we ask for comfort?

192
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.700
Can we ask to be?

193
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.200
Held and soothed nurtured. Can

194
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:49.900
we ask for that?

195
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.300
Can I ask him if I'm important to him? Can I ask her

196
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.300
if I'm good enough for her?

197
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.200
if we can if you can

198
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.400
That's exactly where we're supposed to be.

199
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.200
We're reassured in that moment and on we go.

200
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.300
No trouble.

201
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:08.500
can't

202
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.600
This is where we're in trouble.

203
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.000
If we can't the alarm bell sound.

204
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.200
And they drive us to reach for safety. That's what that

205
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:18.600
video was.

206
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.700
that Say Something video say something

207
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.100
Right. I'm giving up on you trying to

208
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.400
reach for them.

209
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:28.800
for the other

210
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.500
We've reached for the safety of our spouse with the

211
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.500
hope that we're able to get to them.

212
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.900
That video it's exactly what was happening.

213
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.000
So what happens inside when we reach for each

214
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.200
other?

215
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.900
And they don't show up.

216
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.300
So I know some of you weren't in here and didn't get to get to see that.

217
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.700
So I think if it's okay.

218
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.200
Any opportunity any chance that

219
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.100
we could play that part of that again, maybe half of that?

220
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.200
Because I want I want everybody to kind of get the sense of it and I

221
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.300
think we started earlier so and I'll shut up earlier so we

222
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.800
can okay good. Perfect. Let's let's watch a couple minutes of that.

223
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.000
you

224
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.100
something I'm giving

225
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.000
up on you.

226
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.100
I'll be that one.

227
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.300
if you want me to

228
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:56.900
say

229
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.000
I'm giving up on you.

230
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:34.600
if

231
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
you

232
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.300
Okay, that way everybody can kind of get the experience of that. So

233
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.400
I as you were watching that.

234
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.700
You know you almost hear.

235
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.700
The ticking of the clock behind it right? Boom almost

236
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.600
like every second boom. It was just perfect.

237
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.100
So here's what I want you to do just turn each

238
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.300
other's a second little exercise. I

239
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.800
want you to do just kind of turn each other. I guess technically the third and

240
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.300
I want you just to share with each other. What was

241
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.300
it like watching that what comes up for you what thoughts what comments you

242
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.500
have about the video pay attention to maybe something it was

243
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.500
their emotionally. What do you see in that? What do you what do

244
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.200
you pick up from the the tone of the of

245
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.800
the song or the the words just

246
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.700
kind of share with each other for a minute? What what thought if

247
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.600
you go, well that was stupid or whatever. I don't know but just share

248
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.200
with each other kind of what thoughts maybe came up for you why

249
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.200
you were watching that? Okay, so take a couple minutes and do

250
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.200
that.

251
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:25.600
Okay, so

252
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.300
I'm curious if

253
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.400
any of you kind of hear the

254
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.100
longing

255
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:33.600
in that

256
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.300
kind of hear the longing and the desperation in

257
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.300
that in that song. You probably picked

258
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.700
up on some of those kinds of things right? I'm

259
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.100
not a music connoisseur. I don't know what to look for.

260
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.000
There's probably something very, you know important in all

261
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:50.300
of that.

262
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.000
Simply for me is I just hear say something to me.

263
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.100
Hear that in my office all the

264
00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.200
time.

265
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.500
I'm just I just want him to hear me.

266
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.000
and

267
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.000
He doesn't.

268
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.900
And it's looked at negatively and it's like

269
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.600
this song comes to my mind all the time, which is

270
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.400
why I wanted you to see it because it's the longing that

271
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.100
we have there.

272
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.200
The baby if the baby could sing it

273
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.300
would be singing this song right say something say something

274
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.400
that kind of thing. I'm giving up on you right? I'm tensing

275
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.200
up. My body's telling me you're not there for me. I'm going into this

276
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.300
I'm panicking.

277
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.700
And I need you.

278
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.700
And when we don't when they don't show up.

279
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.800
Boy, that's really bad.

280
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.400
So since our

281
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.600
desire to connect is built in.

282
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.300
We naturally do what we can to connect.

283
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.100
to reach for the other

284
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.100
often, however

285
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.700
Our reaching is misunderstood.

286
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.400
We reach for the other seemingly innocently enough

287
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.900
we reach for each other. But yet it's misunderstood.

288
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.800
And he probably even had to say it sometimes before wait

289
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.700
a minute. That's not what I and that's not what I meant.

290
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.100
Almost every one of you in here is probably had to say

291
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.200
that one time in your life. If not, I've said it enough for you.

292
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200
That's not what I meant.

293
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.200
That's not what I didn't mean for it to come out that way. That's not what

294
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.300
I meant.

295
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.500
So when it's misunderstood.

296
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.100
This is when now we kind of enter this.

297
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.500
This could turn into an argument.

298
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.000
Right we end up in this place in the beginning our office

299
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.100
our arguments kind of start off innocently enough.

300
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.600
But as time goes on

301
00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.500
We find ourselves becoming more confused and

302
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.500
more frustrated.

303
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.300
By these arguments, but because they don't give

304
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.600
us the results that they want. Have you ever had an

305
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.200
argument? That didn't end up the way you wanted it

306
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:54.500
to?

307
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.500
most of them right most of

308
00:19:59.500 --> 00:19:59.600
them

309
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.400
Well the confusion and right

310
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.700
and we end up confused and we end up frustrated.

311
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.800
The confusion comes from the fact that we see

312
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.700
ourselves we genuinely and honestly see ourselves

313
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.100
is trying to make the relationship better trying to

314
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.600
reach for the other and connect with them.

315
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.000
But it's not being understood that way. It's not being interpreted that way.

316
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.300
This is where we that's not what I meant. That's not what I that's not

317
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.400
how I said it. That's not what I said. We right we end

318
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:27.800
up in that place.

319
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.900
This is when we begin kind of showing the

320
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.800
other our frustration.

321
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.400
And if you don't have a good definition for frustration, this

322
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.400
is it I want to but I cannot.

323
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.200
I want to make our relationship better, but I

324
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.800
cannot make our relationship better. I want to reconnect with

325
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.900
you, but I cannot reconnect with you.

326
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.800
So I want to buy but I cannot this is how the argument

327
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.900
kind of.

328
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:56.600
Take over.

329
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:57.900
for us

330
00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.300
the frustrations then

331
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.400
kind of turn into outright anger. We

332
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.000
just let it

333
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.400
let it happen.

334
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.200
Not being understood.

335
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.200
Not being there for you, right what the baby

336
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.300
was doing the baby didn't understand. Why can't I get you? I got

337
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.300
it. I'm pointing. I'm giggling. I'm cute. Why can't I

338
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.100
why can't you reach for why can't I get your

339
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:22.700
attention?

340
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.200
So now that's more panic and you could just see the

341
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.000
baby escalate, right? It goes from a look to a crying outright

342
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.000
crying escalated. That's what we do.

343
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.400
We escalate more alarm Bells go off if I

344
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.400
reach for you. You're not there for me more alarm Bells go off. This is

345
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.600
the protest the baby was protesting.

346
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.700
This is a this is what we do as adults.

347
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.800
After a period of time these arguments

348
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.800
develop a very clear and predictable pattern.

349
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.100
This is what Sue says. She's termed these demon

350
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:59.000
dialogues, which I think are very appropriate for

351
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.100
them because once they take over once

352
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.200
the enemy has a foothold in our

353
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.500
marriage right here it no longer feels emotionally safe

354
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.200
for us and we begin to slowly drift apart.

355
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.200
The distance that we feel right we

356
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.400
might be face to face but the

357
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.600
distance that we feel in this that we

358
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.000
kind of sense happening in the relationship drives our

359
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.600
attempts to reconnect because our

360
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.900
attachment need meaning our divinely

361
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.200
inspired internal design has kicked

362
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.300
into high gear.

363
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.500
It's in it's in these milliseconds of

364
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:38.800
time.

365
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:40.800
That our relationship.

366
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.300
Can take a turn for the worse.

367
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.900
And it's such a small window of time that nobody

368
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.400
sees it.

369
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.500
Nobody in my office is I'm talking to them has ever seen

370
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.200
this. They don't ever pay attention that they say I said, well, how does

371
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.600
that feel? Well, I do this. Well get it. Well, how does that feel? I well I

372
00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.000
think this

373
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.800
because it's such a small window of time. They're

374
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.800
just reacting right because they're in a panic.

375
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.200
Nobody sees it happening to them on the inside where

376
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.800
it matters until it's too late.

377
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.400
So we panic.

378
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.200
And when we Panic we typically don't make

379
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:16.800
good decisions.

380
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.500
Right. Typically, we don't we therefore we escalate the

381
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.600
situation to kind of gain some control over it

382
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.200
because we don't want it to you know, kind of over what's happening because

383
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.900
we don't want it to escalate out of control.

384
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.800
But oddly enough it only makes it worse.

385
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.300
And around the cycle we go again.

386
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.800
Making it worse every time this is all an attempt to protect ourselves

387
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.100
and to save our relationship. It just doesn't look that way.

388
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.400
I wholeheartedly believe that at

389
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.900
the core of every couple argument.

390
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.500
is a relational threat

391
00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:56.900
right

392
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.200
at the core of every one of our arguments is

393
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.400
a relational threat.

394
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.100
That is when we begin.

395
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:06.700
arguing

396
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.100
It's just a little tension we can feel it. We begin arguing because

397
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.600
God has designed us to be connected for

398
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.400
a lifetime. This is where our deepest fear of

399
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.800
disconnecting gets touched Pope way

400
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.300
down here way down here in our underbelly, right

401
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.300
hurts.

402
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:26.900
we panic

403
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.800
If I'm not good enough for you, you could find somebody who

404
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.000
is.

405
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.400
That's his deepest fear of disconnection.

406
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.400
Now in place of good enough you can insert whatever you want insert smart

407
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.700
enough.

408
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.800
pretty enough Rich enough

409
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.200
tender enough strong enough

410
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.800
Whatever you want it if I'm not enough.

411
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.000
for you you could find somebody who was

412
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.400
And I hear people all the time say well now that's not that's

413
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.800
what I know. He's not going anywhere. I know she's not going anywhere, you know that intellectually

414
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.400
but deep down there's something inside you

415
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:02.900
saying. Oh,

416
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.700
This could turn bad and I could be alone.

417
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.000
And so this drives us to fight quite literally for

418
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.500
the survival of our marriage.

419
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.200
but again

420
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.400
It doesn't look that way.

421
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.200
So remember what I said earlier about there being one

422
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.600
enemy in our lives. This cycle

423
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.100
is how he works.

424
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.600
This is exactly how he works over time and people

425
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.300
will live like this for decades without

426
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.400
any knowledge of what's happening

427
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:37.700
to them.

428
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.000
They read the books they go to conferences they go

429
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.100
and learn new skills. They'll do all kinds of

430
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.900
things and eventually they end up in this relational misery

431
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.900
go round. You want to call it that and slowly

432
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.300
Our Hope fades.

433
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.000
And that becomes a even scarier place for us.

434
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.400
all the couples in my office

435
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.600
That they're all they're all different. Of course, right? They're

436
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.300
all different different backgrounds different people all those kinds

437
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.600
of things but all of them have this one feature in

438
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.300
common. They're all trapped in this cycle.

439
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.800
So I want to show you visually.

440
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.600
How this works.

441
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.800
right what what I'm showing you in this 45 minutes

442
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.200
or whatever this turns into

443
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.000
it can take a while to figure out so I

444
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.300
want you to kind of see it visually, so

445
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.100
I want you to notice the queue in the middle.

446
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.400
Right. This is kind of this triggering event here.

447
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.200
This could literally be a million different scenario

448
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.800
even more than that. This could be so many scenarios. Imagine

449
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.300
every scenario in the universe. This is it's

450
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.100
like it could be this.

451
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.000
Driving cooking money sex in-laws

452
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.400
Hobbies family work

453
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.400
chores the like I said as many things as are

454
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.400
in the universalists that long that we can argue about those problems

455
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.000
though.

456
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.600
Are not the problem.

457
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.400
It's it's content. They're all content. And what

458
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.300
I want you to see in this is the process.

459
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.800
I want you to follow the lines the arrows

460
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.100
as we go around to see that process at

461
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.400
work.

462
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.000
Okay.

463
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.200
so

464
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.600
Justice Satan wanted Adam and

465
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.900
Eve to look at the fruit

466
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.500
the content

467
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.200
he wants us today to focus on that.

468
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.600
Because he knows that's not going to get us anywhere not on the outcome.

469
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.000
Right where we are in our marriages right

470
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.500
now today.

471
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.500
Especially if we're struggling.

472
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.400
Has been the result of or the outcome of or

473
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.700
i product of living this life

474
00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.400
in this cycle without having any idea

475
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.100
living according to this that I'm going to show you the rest of

476
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.200
it living according to this without any knowledge that it's

477
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:06.800
there.

478
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.400
And you're gonna leave tonight knowing. Oh, okay. There's

479
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.600
something here. There's something here. What is this? And

480
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.200
it's I'm gonna try to go slow through it. Like I said because I want

481
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.500
you to see it.

482
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.400
And at least begin to pay attention to there's something else going

483
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.700
on here. That's kind of hard to.

484
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.600
believe really

485
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:28.600
Okay.

486
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.300
Okay, so when the Q occurs right start right

487
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.400
there and kind of Follow that line and it doesn't matter which which one

488
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.200
you are. You just can't happen to notice.

489
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.100
I'll talk a minute about in our an hour culture. Typically

490
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.700
women are the first ones to notice a

491
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.000
bit of emotional disconnecting.

492
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.300
They just typically that way not all of them. It's

493
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.100
not always that way but typically that way.

494
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.300
So we notice this queue immediately and then we get touched.

495
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.300
There's a core emotion here that gets

496
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.800
touched in you many times. It's just

497
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.100
simple curiosity. It's not a big deal, right? It's not

498
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.300
something it's nothing major a little uncertainty. Maybe you're

499
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.300
glad about something. Like I

500
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.100
said, nothing major, but it's there. There are some other kind of

501
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.600
core emotion that's present. But at

502
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.200
other times depending on your life experiences

503
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.200
or attachment wounds

504
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.700
the core emotion may be

505
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.600
any one of these that I've listed at the bottom that you

506
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:29.900
can see on your

507
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.800
On the handout there can be any one of those.

508
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.500
And just as a point to say something

509
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.900
about attachment wounds.

510
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.200
It comes up in in every one

511
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.300
of my sessions it came up today with a

512
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.400
client of mine and and a struggle

513
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.600
with his adult daughter and just

514
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.300
a big scenario there where she's not

515
00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.400
taking responsibility and taking ownership for some

516
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.500
things that she's doing in her life.

517
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.200
And that really touches him one of those was not caring

518
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.700
for a child and one of her children was

519
00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.400
abused.

520
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.600
And he's processing through this because

521
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.500
it comes up between him and his daughter comes up

522
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.700
between him and his wife and what happens is he is

523
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.800
processing through this today and he's talking about this attachment

524
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.400
wound for him.

525
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.500
His mother was a drug user and was not

526
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.400
present for him and had man after man after

527
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.600
man coming through and would leave her with babysitters to

528
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.600
go out and party. Whatever. Well one of the babysitter sexually abused

529
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:34.600
him.

530
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.100
So he's living the life that his grandson is

531
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.200
living now.

532
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.400
And hit so you can see when I say attachment wound

533
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.400
what this client needed in his life

534
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.700
was somebody to show up for him and to protect him. His

535
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.300
dad was in another.

536
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.700
State he was here and his mom wasn't there and he

537
00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.700
was a kid and he needed to be protected and

538
00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:59.500
he wasn't.

539
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.400
See how when I say attachment wound. You understand what

540
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.400
I'm saying? He needed that and he didn't get that as a

541
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:06.500
kid.

542
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.300
Well that stays in grained.

543
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200
That stays ingrained.

544
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.400
right, and so when it happens with his daughter

545
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.400
And her not taking responsibility and his mom never

546
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.300
took responsibility.

547
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.400
For it never owned it that that's what that she

548
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.400
wasn't there for him never apologize. So he's left

549
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.100
with this wound and his mom died a couple

550
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:30.600
weeks ago.

551
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.200
So it's really coming up for him and now he can

552
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.800
never process and be healed from that with her. Right?

553
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.400
So it's very powerful when he's trying to shove

554
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.500
this responsibility taking ownership down his daughter's throat

555
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.500
because this is deep for him, right he trips

556
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.000
over this with her and he doesn't see it.

557
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.300
He didn't see it when we're talking about it today and he tripped over it right

558
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.100
our daughter Miranda.

559
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.700
Our daughter Miranda. We have we have these three

560
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.400
kit three of the four we have are adopted the last

561
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.200
one. Is she we sell guardianship, but Miranda what

562
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.100
you don't know about Miranda. That's a beautiful picture. She's bright and

563
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.500
smiley. She's a great kid, but on the inside, this

564
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.000
girl is terrified.

565
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.300
And she doesn't remember it cognitively. She doesn't remember

566
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.100
what happened to her. But if you knew Miranda back to her

567
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.100
head flat as a board.

568
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.300
And if anybody knows what that means, I mean,

569
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.100
she laid there and cried and cried and cried and

570
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.300
nobody came to get her.

571
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.900
She doesn't remember that up here.

572
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.400
her body does

573
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:37.000
Right, her body's going to remember. These are attachment wounds.

574
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.300
And Miranda man, she's

575
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.400
if there's two adults talking. Oh, she's gonna be right there. What

576
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.000
are you guys talking about?

577
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.600
She's wanting to know.

578
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.400
You're talking about me. Do I need to know that or if you're upset with

579
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.200
her boy she panics if you think

580
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.400
if she thinks you're upset with her.

581
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.500
she panics

582
00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.500
because this wound for her is so deep. She

583
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.400
doesn't know it. She doesn't remember why she didn't remember that to happen

584
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:02.800
to her when she was.

585
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.200
days and weeks old

586
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.400
She doesn't remember that but her body will never forget it.

587
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.600
It'll always be there. So when I talk about attachments when you hear about attachments, it's

588
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.200
those kinds of things what we needed as a kid that we

589
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.500
didn't get.

590
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.900
And when it happens in in adult relationships you think

591
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.300
this is going to show up in her marriage later on

592
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.000
100% It's going to

593
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:26.400
show up.

594
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.500
It's gonna show up.

595
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:29.900
So

596
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.800
depending on life experiences and depending on attachment wounds

597
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.600
these core emotions here that show

598
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.800
up may be any one of these that's listed now

599
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.700
the instant

600
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.600
One of these is touched.

601
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:51.200
Right like for Miranda, it would be abandonment rejection. Right?

602
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.600
It would be loneliness not being

603
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.800
wanted. It's going to be any one of these right?

604
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.100
Maybe all of them maybe one of them specifically, but it's

605
00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.600
going to be there.

606
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.300
When these are touched people immediately get into

607
00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.000
their heads and the thoughts begin to race, especially as we're as we get

608
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.300
older, right? We have that cognitive ability get in their heads. What's happening?

609
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.700
What have I done? What's wrong? How can I fix this? Right?

610
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.000
So now we start up to scale here. What's happening right here?

611
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.100
There's so many thoughts and questions running through our heads and it's all inside.

612
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.900
It's all inside under the surface and your spouse

613
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.300
can't see it.

614
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.300
Because it's all up in here.

615
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.300
It's all working. So fast up in here can't see

616
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.200
it. They can't hear it.

617
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.100
The emotions that we're feeling then dictate the course of our thoughts.

618
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.700
It's going to dictate the course of our thoughts then immediately what we

619
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.300
show our spouse and when I say show our spout what

620
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.100
I mean is do or say

621
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.600
right what we do.

622
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.400
Or what we say how we say it what we say, whatever that's what

623
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:49.600
I'm talking about.

624
00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.100
We'll talk about anger.

625
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.200
To some degree right instead of a sharing to

626
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.300
hurt or fear. We'll talk about this reason say the surface emotion here

627
00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.600
irritation frustration anger aggravation agitation.

628
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.600
Fear all those kinds of things surface emotion. I'll put in quotes and

629
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.800
I'll tell you why here in a minute.

630
00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.200
They kind of dictate the course. We'll talk about those to some degree, but we

631
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.900
won't share the hurt the fear of the pain.

632
00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.100
I won't share that what we're feeling.

633
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.500
now I'm going to tell you something that

634
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.100
I'm not sure many people if any will agree and that's okay.

635
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.100
I don't mind I'll be different.

636
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.800
I don't believe anger is an emotion.

637
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.900
Just let that sink in for a minute. I don't believe anger is an emotion.

638
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.900
I know it's been traditionally considered one. I've always

639
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.100
assumed it had just been labeled correctly as an

640
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:49.600
emotion.

641
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.400
How I understand emotions right that just something

642
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.600
that we feel in those moments.

643
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.100
always believe that

644
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.900
but the longer I do this work the longer

645
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.100
I work with couples in these kinds

646
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.400
of things.

647
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.800
the more my belief that it's not

648
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:14.000
An emotion is confirmed now. I'll

649
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.000
say this because my wife's here God tell this.

650
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:17.700
I could be wrong.

651
00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.800
Huh? I could be wrong. I may be wrong.

652
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.200
It's entirely possible.

653
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:25.500
but

654
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.600
if I'm wrong.

655
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.900
If it is an emotion.

656
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.900
It's the only one that needs a management program.

657
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.300
Right, listen drugs alcohol

658
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.200
overeating gambling. You

659
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.900
name it?

660
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.000
all of those means of coping with

661
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.600
these

662
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.400
deep core emotions

663
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.400
All of them are destructive.

664
00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.300
And just like anger they all need a management

665
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.100
or a treatment program of some sort.

666
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:02.300
right

667
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.400
It's very intellectual.

668
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.400
Very powerful like rape think of road rage.

669
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.300
We don't call it rage road fear.

670
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.300
Right, we don't run up and say tap on the window because excuse me, sir. You just

671
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.500
pull down me that's terrifying my family.

672
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.200
Right. We don't say that.

673
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.200
But if I come up if I come up, do you

674
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.200
and I this is gonna be brutal. I would

675
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.300
never do this. Just so you'll know my friend who's a trooper.

676
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.200
I'm just telling me he would know I'm not gonna go

677
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.000
up and break your window with a butt of my pistol and stick

678
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:35.900
it in your temple go listen.

679
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.100
But that kind of road right? That'll get your attention.

680
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.100
Anger is designed to get our attention.

681
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.300
to get their spouses attention

682
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.400
that's reason. I think it's a means of coping promise. Just

683
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.400
not a good means of coping.

684
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:53.700
Okay.

685
00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.100
So we only share these surface emotions.

686
00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.300
Irritation frustration and anger. We only

687
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.100
share those and we only share those when we

688
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:04.700
share those.

689
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.400
And allow them to cover up what's really happening for

690
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.500
us underneath.

691
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.200
The words are the actions that come out are going

692
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:14.600
to do damage.

693
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.300
They're going to do damage right we're going to say things we're going

694
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:19.700
to do things.

695
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.500
We're going to become violent. We're going to go file for

696
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.900
divorce. We're gonna do lots of things that are damaging.

697
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.700
Out of our anger we can be critical or aggressive.

698
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.000
But all that does is push our spouse away, thereby exacerbating

699
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.500
their hurt or their fear that they're feeling down there

700
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:38.800
deep.

701
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.600
And we're going to make the situation worse.

702
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:43.300
so

703
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.000
just to be clear.

704
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.300
We don't always show those surface emotions. Those

705
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.300
aren't the ones that all right. Those aren't the

706
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.300
ones that always get touched.

707
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.400
sometimes our fear our fear

708
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.300
response is not to fight right we

709
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:00.300
have

710
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.300
Fight or flight, right? You've all heard that Firefly response.

711
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.400
Sometimes it's a or a flea fight or

712
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.300
Fleet. Right? You've heard that sometimes it's a flea response

713
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.400
or in avoidance response. There's another version It's a

714
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.000
freeze response. And then one of fighting is a fawning

715
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.100
response, it's ways of fighting

716
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.600
or fleeing. It's they're just different.

717
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.600
when one of these shows up

718
00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.000
Right when we are afraid and like our flea response shows up

719
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.300
or whatever. Are we avoid something or we even become

720
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.200
more logical?

721
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.400
Right guys, we like to pride ourselves on. Oh, I'm The Logical one.

722
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.600
She's the emotional one. I got news for you. That logical

723
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.200
one is simply I'm covering up what's happening for me

724
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.000
because I can't let you in on that.

725
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.100
We're more logical in order to remain calm, right? That's what

726
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.600
they teach good skill to learn not not in it.

727
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.600
But because we don't want to make the situation worse we

728
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.400
use it. The problem is I can just make us appear

729
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.800
cold and uncaring I hear that all the time. He's logical

730
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.700
I can't get through him. He's like Mr. Spock. I can't get to him right

731
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.900
robot.

732
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:10.900
And so

733
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.500
That pushes me away keeps me shut out now how this

734
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.800
works. Is this here's the next slide.

735
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.700
When we hide these core emotions with these behaviors right

736
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.700
to criticism harshness contemptuous

737
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.300
talk distance logic

738
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.400
reason, all of those kinds of when we hide

739
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.000
these core emotions with these behaviors it

740
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.700
immediately has an impact on our spouse and it

741
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.800
hits them right here.

742
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.500
And I point to here we know it's here, but you know.

743
00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.000
It hits us right here.

744
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:46.900
criticism

745
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.600
makes us feel inadequate. You've probably been criticized before.

746
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.300
Right. It says you're not good enough.

747
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.400
So it makes us feel inadequate aggressive aggressive behavior is

748
00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.000
frightening.

749
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.600
logic and reason makes us feel unimportant and uncared

750
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:03.700
for

751
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.500
silence makes us feel alone distance makes

752
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.300
us feel abandoned.

753
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.100
It's all that makes sense kind of get

754
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.300
that.

755
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.600
That's important. It's important to understand that these behaviors

756
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.800
are not intended to do that.

757
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:21.800
But that's the outcome.

758
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.100
And because this is more like more than

759
00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.200
likely not the first time this has happened.

760
00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:31.100
You're not going to feel safe enough to share what's happening for you here on the

761
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.600
inside down here on the bottom. So you end up repeating the

762
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.100
same process meaning.

763
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.900
You feel something you feel some emotion the

764
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.400
thoughts run through your head and then you go

765
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.100
up in you know in your mind then you say or do something

766
00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:45.900
to your spouse?

767
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.800
That touches them.

768
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.200
And around we go

769
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.200
again and it's miserable.

770
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.500
The more I protect myself because if you look at this cycle,

771
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.700
right the more I protect myself the more

772
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.100
you have to protect yourself.

773
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.400
It's a modern-day fig leaf.

774
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.900
What Adam did and what he did to protect themselves created distance

775
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.500
between themselves what I do to protect myself

776
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:19.500
makes put you in a position to protect yourself and

777
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.400
what you do to protect yourself then makes

778
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.800
me do it and around we go again.

779
00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.300
And we know where it stops. It doesn't.

780
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.400
We just stop talking about it and then we'll figure out again.

781
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.200
We'll try it again the next day or we'll argue about a different topic.

782
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.500
Hoping to get out of this. It just doesn't work. This is why people go file for divorce because

783
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.400
they don't want to they want to get out of this.

784
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.100
Try to do everything they can to get out of this.

785
00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.300
So the more I protect myself more my

786
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.200
spouse has to protect herself. We just end up pushing each other

787
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:50.500
away.

788
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.000
Then we kind of retreat into the corner.

789
00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.300
That's making it more difficult to express these basic attachment needs.

790
00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:57.800
I need you.

791
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.800
And then we guarantee our inability.

792
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.000
To reach for the other safely.

793
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.000
You are her centrifugal force.

794
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:13.200
Right. I'm not going to ask you to spell it. I know it's challenging centrifugal force,

795
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.400
right? It's kind of it pushes us away. It's this here

796
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.800
in the middle as we go right centripetal is the opposite true pulls

797
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.700
us together. This works like centrifugal force. I

798
00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.100
had one lady tell me she was seeing the the cross and she

799
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.500
goes. Oh, yeah, the X gets bigger that it does.

800
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:27.900
bigger

801
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.600
The further away we get and the further away we get.

802
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.600
we Panic think about

803
00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.900
Anybody ever been caught in a rip current?

804
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.400
Out in the right in the ocean. You don't rip current is Right

805
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.900
pulls your way. And what are they tell you is swim

806
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.400
horizontal to the right or parallel

807
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.300
to the shore to get out of it because if not, you're gonna swim against it

808
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.200
and what's gonna happen. You're gonna be swept out to sea to die.

809
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.400
Right. And so the more you swim against it the

810
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.400
tired you get the further out you go. This is exactly what

811
00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.000
happens to us. The more I try to get to you what I

812
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.000
do to try to get to you if I'm a caught in a rip current. I'm not

813
00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:03.800
going to go. Excuse me.

814
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.800
Who can you put your sandwich down? I need some help.

815
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.200
We're not going to do that.

816
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.100
We don't do that with our spouses either. We cry just doesn't look like

817
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:13.400
a cry.

818
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.700
That makes sense what I want you to see in this.

819
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.400
Okay this destructive cycle.

820
00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.800
It's what we all get trapped into some extent.

821
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.700
And we can live here for years.

822
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.200
without ever

823
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.700
Any hope of getting out of it?

824
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.900
The problem with the cycle being all about protection.

825
00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:37.000
is that

826
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.000
a close emotional relationship

827
00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:45.600
close emotional connection cannot survive.

828
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.200
two people always protecting themselves

829
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.000
They cannot.

830
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.800
imagine trying to hug your spouse

831
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.000
and both of you are wearing a suit of

832
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.300
armor.

833
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.500
It's going to be a little clunky little medley.

834
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:03.500
right

835
00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.100
Maybe loud depending on what you're doing, but you know what I

836
00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:07.200
mean.

837
00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.100
It's not going to be warm and cozy we can't get to each other the way we

838
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:11.900
want to get to each other.

839
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.200
So like I said a minute ago in our culture women tend to be the ones who

840
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.600
are the most sensitive to the emotional disconnection and

841
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.400
the first ones to experience the cue to do

842
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.400
something about it.

843
00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.800
Once they sense this distance.

844
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.200
They began pursuing.

845
00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.300
But because men have been trained to kind of disregard emotions.

846
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:33.500
many of them

847
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.100
many of them

848
00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.800
Have a clue. We don't have a clue how to respond. So

849
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.300
what do we typically do? You share some emotionally you're trying

850
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.400
to reach for me. You want to talk to me, right or you share something with me? What I

851
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.000
typically do what a man do what are we always called?

852
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.700
Fixers right we got to fix it.

853
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.400
So we start we start trying to fix something go. Mow

854
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.500
the lawn or go do the dishes or go?

855
00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.200
Buy something or build something or whatever.

856
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.100
All in a all in an effort to show our wives that we love

857
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:05.200
them.

858
00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.300
Now it's probably not a lady in the house. It's going to go and that

859
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.000
works perfectly.

860
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.300
Right. Nobody's gonna go. Yes, I love it when he tries

861
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.600
to fix my problem by going to do that. I remember years ago. I was telling Candice.

862
00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.100
I was giving her three points in a sermon it was gonna be

863
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.100
good of how to take care of the she works in

864
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.300
a family business and I was trying to help her with a problem because she

865
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.200
clearly needed help this problem because she was telling

866
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.800
me about it, right? I'm gonna help her fix it and she

867
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.500
looked at me and this is the moment that I probably I

868
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.800
grew up but this is the moment. It was really good. She said,

869
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.100
Do you think I'm incompetent?

870
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.500
If I hit me in the head.

871
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.100
No. No, why are you trying to fix it?

872
00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.100
Right. I just want you to hear me. Right? You've probably all seen all of it. I should have brought

873
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.900
the video. You've all seen that the nail in the head.

874
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.500
You'll see that everybody seen the nail in it. If not Google it

875
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.300
YouTube or whatever find the nail in it. It's hysterical, but that's

876
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.600
kind of right but there's that nail we could just put

877
00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:06.300
that's what we do.

878
00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.500
This is why I keep paper because I'll take a rabbit hole like crazy.

879
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.300
I'll do that. So we all do that.

880
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.500
Wives we know this doesn't work.

881
00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.400
Our Panic increases you're not there for me. You don't understand what's happening for

882
00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.800
Me and You Begin seeking a comforting response?

883
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:25.500
But you do so in a way that ensures that

884
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.600
that need is not going to be met.

885
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:29.400
This is where

886
00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:31.900
you're always at work.

887
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.000
You're never home. You never want to spend time with me. You're always on your

888
00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.100
phone. Right? We've all said those.

889
00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.200
To each other that's where those things come out come into play.

890
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.100
Why do you think we take that very well?

891
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.700
I think we like that hearing that. Oh, you're you're always

892
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.300
at work. You're never at home. You're always out playing

893
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.000
golf. You're always.

894
00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.800
Mowing the lawn you're always fixing stuff. You're whatever no.

895
00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.400
No, we don't like that.

896
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:00.900
because

897
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.600
we take that as a sign that we're failing.

898
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.700
And really for guys and I think you'll all agree.

899
00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:11.800
That's the that's the big F word for us.

900
00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.500
failing we hate

901
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.100
failing

902
00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.000
so

903
00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.600
because our culture teaches us our culture teaches

904
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.300
man. We learn it in man school. I don't know if you know about that. We learn it

905
00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.600
in man School growing up that if you're not providing and you're

906
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.000
not protecting you have no value.

907
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.400
right, and so if we fail

908
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.700
We have no value.

909
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.000
So we feel inadequate.

910
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.400
And you feel alone and we're stuck we're

911
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.200
trapped in this again.

912
00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.800
That sounds miserable. That sounds awful.

913
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.400
That's where people get and listen if you're there

914
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.100
and I'm sorry that you're there. It is an outcome of

915
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.200
what's been happening. It's an outcome of this if you're not there if

916
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.900
you're getting married or you're gonna get married whatever then pay attention

917
00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.900
to this because this will happen so fast Adam and

918
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.300
Eve it happened then right.

919
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:12.200
Now get I get listen. This is a lot to take in

920
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.200
almost one to say something about like hey open up because here's you

921
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.400
a big old fire hose. I'm gonna pour this on to you. This is

922
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.300
challenging this can take months for people

923
00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:21.700
to get

924
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.100
Right. I tell people that a large majority of

925
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.800
the work I do with them is helping them understand this. It's

926
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.200
like 75% of the work that we do

927
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.300
with couples that I do with couples is helping them get this

928
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.400
because it's like wait a minute. I've been living this way and you're

929
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.200
telling me that he's been crying for me all these times that he's

930
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.300
not there for me. Yeah. That's why it's happening.

931
00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.900
And now he's just Frozen. He's like, oh I can't I

932
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.300
can't tell her that.

933
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:52.800
Can't this is what happens?

934
00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.400
So here's what I want you to do. This is

935
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.500
a lot to take in. I just want to take you a couple minutes.

936
00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.500
Here to talk about this with each

937
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.500
other kind of what comes up for you with this cycle.

938
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.100
Right? I think we put that that'll be up on the screen.

939
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.900
But before that I do want to remind you.

940
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.300
It's not always just women who notice the emotional disconnection. I

941
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.900
notice it.

942
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.400
I noticed that men do as well. We'll just we're worried.

943
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.100
We're worried. You're going to see us as weak.

944
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.300
If we ask to be comforted.

945
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.000
We're told we're good enough.

946
00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.600
So we just don't bring it up. We just kind of suffer in

947
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:32.800
silence.

948
00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:34.700
And be quiet.

949
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.000
So please don't hear me kind of perpetuating this The

950
00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.200
Stereotype of the emotional woman not we're

951
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.600
all emotional.

952
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.100
God is emotional. We're all emotional. It's just

953
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:50.100
we adapt to it differently culturally. We

954
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.900
have these adaptations that we're taught. We're all

955
00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:53.900
emotional we all feel

956
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:58.400
And so guys will feel this too. It's not just it's not

957
00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.200
just the ladies.

958
00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.200
Because we're both designed the same

959
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:06.000
way. All right, so just was very wrap up and give you a couple minutes. I

960
00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.200
just want to you talk to each other.

961
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.100
What comes up as you think about this?

962
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.200
What thoughts come up for you? I hear about this cycle.

963
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.200
Maybe talk about do you see this happening?

964
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.000
in your relationship

965
00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:22.100
It's going to be it's a little tough, but just kind of talk to each other

966
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.500
for a couple minutes and see what you come up with. Okay?

967
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:29.100
Okay.

968
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.000
Maybe you'll continue that conversation.

969
00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.200
Later at home. I hope

970
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:38.900
and I'm sure.

971
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.800
Some of you have already kind of been thinking about how this

972
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.100
sounds very familiar.

973
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:50.100
Kind of in your own marriage and you're and you're wondering how to stop

974
00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:50.200
it.

975
00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.200
That's a big question. Right? How do we how do

976
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.400
we get out of this? And I don't want you to think

977
00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:57.900
of it as a

978
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.300
Oh, well, we may start fighting we get in the cycle.

979
00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.300
No, that's when it kind of just escalates. We

980
00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:07.400
live in it. The enemy is right. It's why

981
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.200
it's predictable. It's why it's like if you're gonna say,

982
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.300
oh, I don't know. I'm not sure. I want to talk this about talk to

983
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:16.000
you about this. Like if I come home, I'm having a bad day.

984
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.400
I got to figure out how to put on a good face because I don't want to it's you're

985
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.200
not saying anything to or you're in your own head the Cycles already

986
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.200
at work with you.

987
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.100
Right because it's the outcome it makes itself necessary.

988
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.400
in your life

989
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.100
So you're probably already seeing it. So I don't want you to get the idea that

990
00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:38.200
it's just something that we get into and then get out of no, we

991
00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.700
always live in it until we're able to step outside of

992
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:41.900
it.

993
00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.700
And that's why it's crucial to understand it and

994
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.100
recognize it. It's this force that says

995
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:52.700
don't don't be vulnerable. Don't let the other end. Don't

996
00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.400
do that. That's the enemy.

997
00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.200
That's the enemy right there.

998
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:03.300
So, how do we get out of it? How do we get to a place where we can both feel vulnerable

999
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.300
and both feel safe enough

1000
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:05.900
with each other?

1001
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:09.300
Safe enough with our spouses to

1002
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.300
kind of share these core emotions rather

1003
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.300
than being forced to cover them up or hide

1004
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:15.500
them.

1005
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.900
That's going to be that's my goal for tomorrow morning. That's

1006
00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:20.900
what we're going to talk about tomorrow.

1007
00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.500
The good news is you can get out of it.

1008
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.000
The bad news is it's tough because the enemy doesn't

1009
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.700
want you to.

1010
00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:31.900
right

1011
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:33.800
his

1012
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.000
his number one purpose

1013
00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.000
kill steal and destroy

1014
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:44.100
It just soon you be dead. Really. I mean frankly it just seen you be dead.

1015
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.400
He wants to destroy the happiness in your marriage. He

1016
00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.600
wants to destroy your family.

1017
00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.500
This is what he wants.

1018
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.200
And and I I never think you know, sometimes I have

1019
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.500
thought before is like wow, that's enough as you think Satan has ever

1020
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.200
thought. Oh boy that I really went too far on that

1021
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:01.200
one.

1022
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:02.400
No.

1023
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.700
He wants nothing left. Nothing less

1024
00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:09.200
at all than you. I wonder you be dead

1025
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.600
because you can't share the gospel with anybody. That's the

1026
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.200
first reason but he doesn't want your marriage to be

1027
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.300
a witness to anybody. You destroy them marriage you

1028
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.800
destroy the foundation of society.

1029
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.500
Look at where we've been the last 60 years 70 years.

1030
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:25.900
right

1031
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.700
So he doesn't want you to get out of it I do.

1032
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.600
I don't know you but what I will tell you is I love

1033
00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.300
you and I don't want you trapped in this thing because

1034
00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.700
it makes you miserable.

1035
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.400
I want you to have the kind of marriage that God designed for

1036
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.900
us to have it's open and honest remember they

1037
00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:49.700
were naked and unashamed.

1038
00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.200
That's where I want you that's my goal. You ask me. What's your goal

1039
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.500
with couples Genesis 2:28, and they were naked and

1040
00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.100
unashamed.

1041
00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.800
Just like that. So my prayer.

1042
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.200
My prayer is for all of you to come to

1043
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.000
understand when this thing happens.

1044
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.700
When it comes up in your marriage and be able to step outside of

1045
00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.500
it into something else.

1046
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.600
Into that kind of relationship that you've always desired.

1047
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.300
So I look forward to tomorrow morning.

1048
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.600
To kind of talking about this and trying to help you focus on

1049
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.900
seeing this a little more clearly stepping outside

1050
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:28.300
of it.

1051
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.600
and then into this new

1052
00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.700
relationship where you can reconnect in a

1053
00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:38.100
way that you

1054
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:42.800
Never thought possible. Okay, you can recognize it

1055
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.300
once you recognize it. That's great. But you

1056
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.400
got to be able to do something else. It's the

1057
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.000
something else. That's how do we reconnect? Okay. Hey, we saw

1058
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.300
the cycle. We're in the cycle. I heard people all the time. So yeah, we talked about it.

1059
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.300
This is that this is that thing that Larry's talking

1060
00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:00.200
about when we're there right the tornado They Call

1061
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.500
It Whatever kinds of things that they want to kind of cyclone they call it all kinds of things the

1062
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:03.800
enemy

1063
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.500
They see it happening in their in their relationship and that's

1064
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.200
what they say. There's happened, but we don't know what to do about it.

1065
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.700
We don't know what to do about that's what I help them in sessions do but

1066
00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.900
in those moments of panic. Hey, this is it. What do we do now?

1067
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:21.300
So tomorrow we're going to talk about what do we do now? How do we reconnect?

1068
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.000
Okay, so

1069
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.100
that's all I have for you, but I think they're gonna

1070
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.200
They're gonna make you like do some exercise or something.

1071
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.200
Yeah, get it up really and that was so good and you

1072
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.500
want to take this in so we're what

1073
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.700
we want to be able to do now and while Larry Larry's

1074
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.100
gonna stay you gonna stay up there brother, so we're

1075
00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:43.400
sit down. I'll sit with you. Okay. Thank you.

1076
00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:48.100
So we wanted to make some time here to

1077
00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:50.000
reflect because we've got some time to do

1078
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.300
it. You know, when we started talking about doing this conference. We

1079
00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:56.600
wanted it to be a really interactive experiential opportunity and

1080
00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.000
by saying that just now I probably freaked a million of you

1081
00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.300
out because remember people here I probably freaked a bunch of you out by saying that

1082
00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.000
but we just want to take a minute because we've got

1083
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.800
Larry right here. We wanted to just get some honest response

1084
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.100
out of some of you guys or if you had any question right

1085
00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.400
away, we've got some time to handle that

1086
00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.500
and or any reaction that you had

1087
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.400
that was really special that you wanted to share and and I

1088
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.600
don't mind setting the tone for this. I was sitting next to my wife and and

1089
00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:27.000
I got a really really lovely vulnerable response

1090
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.300
out of her and she's so glad I'm sharing this about her right

1091
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.100
now, but I gotta really lovely revulnerable France out of

1092
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.300
her and it was really nice. So that was a cool exercise. So we

1093
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.300
reacted really well to that. So anybody just put

1094
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.300
your hand up and we're gonna travel whether you're over there over here

1095
00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:44.100
just put your hand up and if you've got a question or reaction that you

1096
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:44.300
want to

1097
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.100
Yeah.

1098
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:49.400
extra fries

1099
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.300
So if you got a question or a comment to

1100
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.000
put your hand up, we'll come to you.

1101
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.500
And if you don't we've got some in the bag we can use I forget

1102
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.100
that I'm not I'm not asking any questions forget that.

1103
00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:08.400
Yeah.

1104
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:15.400
So you were kind of talking about attachment style and

1105
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.000
how that's formed as a child. Correct? Yes. So is

1106
00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:22.300
that able is that something that you can change your attachment

1107
00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:22.600
Style?

1108
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.600
um, you know, I think

1109
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.800
First and foremost. Yes. I'm going to say yes because

1110
00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.600
Like this client that I was talking about this morning or even even my

1111
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:35.400
my daughter.

1112
00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.700
She recognized she doesn't recognize it yet, you know.

1113
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:40.800
Oh you do?

1114
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.100
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1115
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.900
Listen God is our ultimate healer person foremost.

1116
00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:54.800
But our spouses are not on this planet just

1117
00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.800
to hang out with us.

1118
00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.100
They can be healers for us.

1119
00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:03.100
I know in my own life what I've experienced right the

1120
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.500
trauma. I've experienced what I needed.

1121
00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.000
I get from her.

1122
00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.500
I get from her and that heals me when God shows

1123
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.900
up for us that's healing for us.

1124
00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.700
Right when we show up for our spouses that's healing.

1125
00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:19.300
when it's not

1126
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:20.900
scary

1127
00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:24.500
and so I think when we know that when we're able to rest in

1128
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.000
that security of knowing

1129
00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:30.800
You know, if if you guys got up and walked out early on

1130
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.000
then guess what I can go to Candice and

1131
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.500
I can say I feel like such a failure.

1132
00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:38.400
Like this was hard. I haven't told her after the first session, you

1133
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.800
know because this is not what I do. I'm like

1134
00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.400
This is scary touching that part of me. And so I'll know

1135
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.400
she's there for me.

1136
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:49.700
That I'm accepted by her when that's ingrained in

1137
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.900
us not intellectually, but full body

1138
00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.700
experience.

1139
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:58.000
Then yes, I think that changes us. Are we going

1140
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.200
to maybe

1141
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.500
Tend to react to that way a lot. Yes, but this is

1142
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.500
what I tell people all the time too is like with anxiety because you

1143
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.300
know anxiety is just so rampant.

1144
01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:08.700
is that

1145
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.500
instead of

1146
01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:13.100
husband

1147
01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.500
or wife trying to heal the other or trying to trying to

1148
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.200
help them cope with the other or whatever with the

1149
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.500
anxiety. Can you just accept it? Can you just hold it and

1150
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.200
just understand it. This is what I have.

1151
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.500
Right this anxious avoidant attachment or whatever. Whatever that may be this.

1152
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.200
I'm just feeling anxious that you're not gonna be there for

1153
01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.500
me and if I can come to you and say I'm kind of I'm kind

1154
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.200
of worried about this.

1155
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.200
This is scary for me.

1156
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.400
Right. I've told her a couple times throughout this thing doing this.

1157
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.200
This is scary for me to do it. She's like

1158
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:45.800
I bet it is.

1159
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.600
There's a lot of people gonna be there.

1160
01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.700
Right, and they can make fun of you.

1161
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.300
And and she's not fixing it. She's not trying to say well you're this

1162
01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:58.100
and you're this and you're this and you're that she's you can fix it.

1163
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.200
All you want the reality is that's gonna be up here. That's not

1164
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:01.900
gonna touch me here.

1165
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:06.800
But when you just show up for me there man, that's security

1166
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.400
that's like I can take you on like

1167
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.900
you're one man, like Gideon did right I

1168
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.500
can go and tell because you're with

1169
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:15.600
me.

1170
01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.600
She's with me. I think that is big healing.

1171
01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.100
So that's kind of the long version of that maybe.

1172
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.100
I don't know exactly but that's the way it

1173
01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.800
feels to me is that we can heal each other.

1174
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.200
Jimmy's coming for you.

1175
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.300
Um kind of bouncing off of that.

1176
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.100
I had a question. So a lot

1177
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.200
of times I hear in different things, you know, this idea

1178
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.600
like codependency and you know not being needy and

1179
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:47.800
so

1180
01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:51.400
Can you kind of explain the balance there? Like how

1181
01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.100
does like does you or me when I think about like what you

1182
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.200
just talked about about being able to lean in on your

1183
01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.500
spouse? I immediately I immediately

1184
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.400
thinking well, how do I not come off

1185
01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.700
as being needy or codependent?

1186
01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:06.400
Yeah.

1187
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.800
I abhor that word.

1188
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.900
I pour the word narcissist as well.

1189
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.800
You think about kind of a core feature of narcissism is?

1190
01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.900
Somebody who always thinks about themselves.

1191
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.200
Well, you start asking a narcissist to tell them

1192
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.600
about life experiences.

1193
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.300
You're going to find out.

1194
01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:32.000
They had to take care of themselves. Nobody showed up for

1195
01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.100
them to take care of them. So it make doesn't that make sense that they have to take care

1196
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.800
of themselves to the detriment of relationships. Yeah.

1197
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.200
So the term codependency I think is kind of the same

1198
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:41.400
way.

1199
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.800
Is that it's something that is kind of been I don't

1200
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.500
know maybe culturally constructed. Is that because

1201
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.400
I mean if you think about it and I'll just stand up here if

1202
01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.300
you think about it. I mean our culture was found

1203
01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.400
on Independence, right? We celebrate that

1204
01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.000
day Independence.

1205
01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.200
And so we don't we think dependence is

1206
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:03.600
a bad thing.

1207
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.600
Now Candice is not my air and

1208
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.200
my water and oxygen those guys.

1209
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.600
She's not that for me. God supplies that

1210
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.100
for me, but what I need from her.

1211
01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.300
He supplied.

1212
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.100
me with her to need that so what I look at

1213
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.600
it is like, you know, if you think about kind of the definite I think codependency one

1214
01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:27.000
is kind of

1215
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.300
it's misrepresented. It's me being dependent on you being dependent on

1216
01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:31.500
me.

1217
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.800
And the kind of need that that's kind of the traditional listen old

1218
01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.400
version of it. We it's just now codependency is just

1219
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.500
I need you, okay?

1220
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:40.900
You need me.

1221
01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:42.600
I need her.

1222
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.000
Right, she needs me and we don't pathologize that.

1223
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.100
I think our culture does as a way

1224
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.500
of us being kind of big strong man and those I'm not a big strong man, right

1225
01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.200
but just as big strong man, and the reality is

1226
01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.900
all I do is think of the the main

1227
01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.500
person I think of in situations like that is Jesus.

1228
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.400
On the cross he could have in an

1229
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:06.700
instant.

1230
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:12.100
Ended all of this, but he didn't he was vulnerable. He

1231
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.200
made himself vulnerable. This is

1232
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.400
the idea. I think from behind dependence is it it

1233
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.400
makes us vulnerable. We're not supposed to be vulnerable. We're supposed

1234
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.100
to protect ourselves. I don't know. I didn't have never read

1235
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.300
that anywhere never really believed that

1236
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:26.500
and so

1237
01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:30.500
I don't know if that answers your question or not. I just

1238
01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.600
I don't like the word. I don't I know

1239
01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.300
people use it and those kinds of things and it makes sense that people

1240
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:40.900
use it through kind of their exploration and learning about life and

1241
01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.500
relationships and things like that. But for me,

1242
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.600
I don't have any trouble telling people I need

1243
01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:46.800
her.

1244
01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.900
I need her. I don't have any trouble telling people I need Jesus.

1245
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.900
I'm having trouble telling people. I need my wife.

1246
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.300
She's important to me and I want her to know every day.

1247
01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.000
She's important to me.

1248
01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:58.700
So

1249
01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:03.900
That one right here.

1250
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:10.100
So when you were talking about kind of the residual things

1251
01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:13.300
that happen as a kid that carry

1252
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:13.900
on into our marriage.

1253
01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.700
do you think that we need to

1254
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.900
Deal with it with the say parent to be

1255
01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.600
able to deal with it in the marriage.

1256
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.200
Okay one help me understand.

1257
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.100
More about that the attachments so the

1258
01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.000
issues with attachments.

1259
01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.300
So the negative attachments that we have

1260
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.000
that have come from kind of

1261
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:45.700
like you said that parent child relationship like the

1262
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.900
wound. Yes the wound.

1263
01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.300
Would we need to deal with that?

1264
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.400
before we could

1265
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.300
positively deal with that in the marriage like it

1266
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.500
is something that is like almost like a prerequisite.

1267
01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.800
Like dealing with like with that parent. Yes, certainly.

1268
01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:05.500
Though I think that's the best sometimes that's

1269
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.200
not possible this client. His wife his mom died.

1270
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.400
That's not possible.

1271
01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.600
I do think that can be healed in him by

1272
01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.500
his wife and it's what we talked about with him today his wife

1273
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.500
showing up and understanding that's what he needed. He has to

1274
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:20.600
verbalize that so

1275
01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.200
Is that the best yes the right there

1276
01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.000
and in a room to size undoubtedly there

1277
01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.600
have people there are people that have been sexually abused.

1278
01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.400
That is in my own life. That is people that

1279
01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.300
I know that tons of people that I work with and

1280
01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.400
Though I would say that's the ideal person.

1281
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.700
That's not the safest. That's not

1282
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.400
going to be a safe person to do that. That person may

1283
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.300
be in prison. I don't know.

1284
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.400
dead so I don't think it's a

1285
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
prerequisite

1286
01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.800
Can it if it's safe, yes.

1287
01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.300
If like if it's a parent then something like that and you've

1288
01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.400
tried to address it that way. Yes, I think that's the best person but if

1289
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.800
you go and they don't accept you or they more

1290
01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.200
damage than of course, that's another

1291
01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.100
wound. That's the hard part about being vulnerable. But then I

1292
01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.100
think that's when our that's when our

1293
01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.100
spouses come into play

1294
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.800
so I hope that answer your question. I'm not really good at this but

1295
01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.300
answering the question guys. Okay, I think you're doing

1296
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:27.400
Great. Oh.

1297
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.500
okay, I had a question about

1298
01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:35.300
The the cycle that you were referencing here.

1299
01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.500
Yes, would you say that?

1300
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.200
Getting out of the cycle means learning how

1301
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:41.700
to communicate.

1302
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.400
with those core emotions or

1303
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.700
I don't know. I'm just kind of

1304
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.300
trying to gather what you here. Go steal my thunder for tomorrow.

1305
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:55.400
Oh, am I here you

1306
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.500
are right you you're

1307
01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.500
exactly right if the question if I'm hearing you

1308
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.900
correctly is how to get out of it understanding what's

1309
01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.100
happening for us at our core and being able

1310
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.100
to communicate. Yes communicate that

1311
01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:13.000
if that's the question 100% Yes.

1312
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:14.900
That's challenging.

1313
01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:20.000
and that's intellectually we

1314
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:22.400
can understand that but then we have

1315
01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.300
to be able to

1316
01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.800
move toward them and

1317
01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:28.700
share it.

1318
01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.100
but

1319
01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:33.400
we don't know how sharing it.

1320
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:37.500
Is going to impact him. I had a lady this morning. She was like I'm sharing

1321
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.300
the feelings.

1322
01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.400
She's a therapist.

1323
01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.800
With her husband in my office and she's like I'm sharing

1324
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.800
these feelings with him.

1325
01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.500
Which she thinks is a good thing and it

1326
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.500
is right.

1327
01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.700
The problem is now that she's verbalized that it.

1328
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.100
pokes him

1329
01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.400
And because he then right she says you're not there for

1330
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.900
me and I need you. I feel lonely.

1331
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.400
Wonderful. Yes, but him not showing

1332
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.300
up for her to get it he can't because

1333
01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.500
he feels inadequate.

1334
01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.500
And so his wall goes up.

1335
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:14.700
Freezes up and then for her it's like

1336
01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.600
you don't care now. It's aggravated or

1337
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.300
exacerbated and now we're in the cycle. Does

1338
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:20.600
that make sense?

1339
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.100
So yes, that's a that's a great Point. That's exactly what we're

1340
01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.900
going to talk about tomorrow kind of walking you through.

1341
01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:31.600
how to get out of that how to this is important to recognize it

1342
01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.500
but then being able to step out of it is really really

1343
01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:34.800
important

1344
01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.700
We got one over here.

1345
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.200
Okay. Okay, go ahead. Okay. So

1346
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.900
my question is when you have friends or family members that

1347
01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:47.400
are also Believers and they're going through a really challenging time

1348
01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.900
in their marriage. What is your responsibility or

1349
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:53.800
any advice on how to come alongside

1350
01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.900
them other than just obviously praying for them on

1351
01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:00.200
how to help them. Yes, I guess

1352
01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.100
the question for me would be

1353
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.800
are you helping just one of them or both of them?

1354
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.400
Both both. Okay. Well one never bash

1355
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:10.700
the other

1356
01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.000
Right. Don't bash the other and for me

1357
01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:14.800
what I would say is.

1358
01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:16.800
And I'll talk about this tomorrow.

1359
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.400
All Behavior makes sense in context.

1360
01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:24.600
And what we're getting from one, we don't get the context. We

1361
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.000
have to look at the cycle for context what's happening context is

1362
01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:30.700
life experiences, right including

1363
01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:33.800
childhood experiences current experiences

1364
01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.600
with the marriage understanding. What

1365
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.500
is the behavior in context and being able then

1366
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.800
to understand what it's

1367
01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.000
like for him and her

1368
01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.100
What is it like three words? It'll save

1369
01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:47.800
your life. Help me understand.

1370
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.900
Right. I love you as good.

1371
01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:53.800
But help me understand especially in this relationship and

1372
01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.800
for you to ask him. Hey, help me understand. What is what

1373
01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.600
it's like for you in this situation and be

1374
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.500
able to validate that first and foremost. It's not yours to

1375
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.600
fix just understand it be able to hold it and understand it.

1376
01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:09.300
And then being able to help her him. I'm

1377
01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:12.600
not sure which one you're working with. Whatever. Maybe it's a kind of a couple thing, which

1378
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.500
is good being able to help them

1379
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:16.400
kind of see this.

1380
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:21.000
A little bit. Do you think he do

1381
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.500
you think whatever his position maybe his anger his

1382
01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:26.900
withdrawing whatever do you think in his

1383
01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.900
anger that he is scared?

1384
01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.500
Helping her to see through it. I I do

1385
01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.700
like to say a lot of times is what I like to.

1386
01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.300
What I'm showing you one I'm trying to help you here and

1387
01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:42.600
see something that can't be heard and or or seen right

1388
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.500
and and I'm trying to kind of give you superpowers trying

1389
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500
to give you some X-ray vision.

1390
01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.300
I want you to be able to see through what's happening.

1391
01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.500
Out here or shutting you

1392
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.100
out to see what's really happening is I'm talking

1393
01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:01.000
this client this morning. I see when I ask him a question. Oh boy,

1394
01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.300
you can just see the it goes in

1395
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.200
his face and he is behind a wall because he is terrified of

1396
01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.000
answering the question. So with this couple

1397
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.100
Kind of working and you have to do it slowly because if you just go dump this

1398
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.400
on I'm kind of like me dumping this on you. It's like no, that's not it.

1399
01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.300
He's just angry or she's just cold.

1400
01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.300
Whatever if we perpetuate that, we're not helping

1401
01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:26.400
them being able to give them kind of an alternate. What is he?

1402
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.300
What if he's doing this? What if he's doing this what if she's reaching for

1403
01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:33.000
you and you don't see it that way what if whatever right

1404
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.400
giving them some scenarios and kind of helping them?

1405
01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.700
Maybe that way a little bit.

1406
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.900
That makes sense helpful.

1407
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.300
Larry we got one more for you. Okay?

1408
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:48.400
I'm just maybe really looking for a suggestion. So what if

1409
01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.700
you both see that your marriage needs work, right? Okay.

1410
01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.000
Okay. Well, let's say let me come down there because what

1411
01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:57.700
you probably don't know is I have tinnitus, you

1412
01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.400
know, everybody know what tenant it is. Right sounds like a train Screech

1413
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.300
into halt my ears all the time. So I'm gonna come closer so I

1414
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.000
can actually sorry here, you know your phone.

1415
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:09.400
It's at eighties loud rock music. So you both

1416
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.900
know your marriage needs work. Yes, right, but how

1417
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.700
do you get one another to come alongside the

1418
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:18.800
path together

1419
01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:22.400
And and it's not like well one is

1420
01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.300
up here and the other one's got a catch up. But so that you're

1421
01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.700
both in sync with what needs to be work worked

1422
01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.500
on and it's not. Well, they need to work on this first

1423
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.500
and then I'll work on this and then I'll write it needs

1424
01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:37.400
to be together it does and that's the ideal spot

1425
01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.600
asking. So what I will say is if there's maybe some resistance.

1426
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.500
That maybe some resistance to come along.

1427
01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.500
On both sides. Remember all Behavior makes sense

1428
01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.300
in context

1429
01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:52.300
that resistance first and foremost needs to

1430
01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:52.700
make sense.

1431
01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.100
What is it about doing this it kind of

1432
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.300
makes sense that you're maybe kind of holding back.

1433
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.200
Or that you're not wanting to come alongside or maybe not wanting to

1434
01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.400
work on this it has to make sense in some

1435
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.200
way and and they do have to talk to you about it. They do

1436
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.400
have for nothing you I don't know who you're talking about, but being able to talk

1437
01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.800
about it and and then for us

1438
01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.400
To be able to understand what is

1439
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.500
it about that? I mean I have to do like

1440
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.100
I'm not going to lie it therapy's hard for

1441
01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:23.300
guys.

1442
01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.200
Right. It's just which because we can't if we

1443
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.500
are going to therapy most of the time it's because

1444
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.300
we've done something wrong. We feel bad. We feel like a failure.

1445
01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.400
We've not done enough. We're inadequate and so I have to help guys

1446
01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.100
understand a lot of time. It makes sense that you wouldn't

1447
01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:41.400
want to come to therapy. It'd be the last thing I want to do. I did I

1448
01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.600
did one session of marital 30 way back when I hated it.

1449
01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:48.500
Right because I felt like a terrible failure and I knew what I was doing it

1450
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.000
was wrong. I don't so.

1451
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.000
When people kind of offer that resistance, the first thing that I

1452
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:57.600
want to do with them is make sense of it and even tell them I get it that makes

1453
01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:00.600
sense to me. I totally understand not wanting to because

1454
01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.300
when we do that

1455
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.300
when we hold that resistance for them, it makes

1456
01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:05.800
sense of that for them.

1457
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.800
They can feel a little safer. It's a process where

1458
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.400
where this couple or whatever you might be talking

1459
01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.500
about where they are in their marriage is an outcome

1460
01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.700
of this thing working for so long.

1461
01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:22.400
And so it's not going to be hot. It's not going to happen in

1462
01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.900
30 minutes or an hour, right? We're gonna have to understand it and then

1463
01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.300
understand it a little bit more understand it a

1464
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:28.500
little bit more.

1465
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.000
To kind of help them feel safer.

1466
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.900
It just takes takes a little bit of time. So the resistance

1467
01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:37.200
just makes sense of it understand it because it's

1468
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.400
it's really important because that'll create some safety.

1469
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.300
Okay, okay.

1470
01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.800
Thanks, Larry. Thanks Larry. This has been great. This

1471
01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.600

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.400
Don't touch that dial.

1475
01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.100
