00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:02.085
All right.

2
00:00:03.565 --> 00:00:06.845
A church family. This is, uh, my good friend Cliff Dalton.

3
00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:10.885
Cliff, uh, grew up in a church that, uh,

4
00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:14.125
practiced infant baptism, uh,

5
00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:17.165
and as one, he was baptized as an infant.

6
00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:22.645
He came to saving faith as a teenager,

7
00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.885
and about three years ago, he started coming to Henderson.

8
00:00:28.865 --> 00:00:31.965
And after, uh, searching the scriptures

9
00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.565
and talking with pastors

10
00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:38.525
and thoughtful prayer, he thought, you know what?

11
00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:42.885
I should follow the Lord in believers' baptism.

12
00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:48.925
And so today, based on your testimony, my dear brother,

13
00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:54.125
cliff, I baptize you in the name of the Father

14
00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:56.005
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

15
00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:03.405
Amen. Amen.

16
00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:08.325
Thank you so much, church, family. Let's please pray.

17
00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:13.645
Heavenly Father, our, our cups are full from today.

18
00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:17.205
We thank you so much for all that you're

19
00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:19.165
doing, all that you've done.

20
00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:23.565
We thank you for your unbelievable gift of salvation,

21
00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:27.685
that this is a picture of, this is not it,

22
00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:30.965
but it's such a, a powerful symbol

23
00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:34.805
and a powerful manifestation of the death

24
00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:36.885
that you have brought to life.

25
00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:41.485
We thank you for what you have done in cliff's life

26
00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.685
and heart, and what you're going to keep doing in Him

27
00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:48.605
and all of these, uh, recipients of your salvation.

28
00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:49.845
Lord, we ask for more.

29
00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:55.605
Lord, we, we thank you so much for what you're doing.

30
00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:01.725
Father, we ask that you would continue

31
00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:02.885
to fall on this church.

32
00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:05.605
You continue to move in our hearts.

33
00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:07.685
We thank you for the sermon today.

34
00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:11.565
May we never forget, we, we don't need to leave here

35
00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:14.005
and just say, well, that was really great,

36
00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:16.205
and then forget you, Lord.

37
00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:18.765
We want to commune with you all throughout the day.

38
00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:22.085
And so we ask for your blessing from here

39
00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.525
in Jesus' name, amen.

40
00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:26.925
But your.
