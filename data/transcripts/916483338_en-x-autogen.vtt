WEBVTT

1
00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:51.255
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:55.695
I hope that, uh, we can find a bit of refuge in this room,

3
00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:56.975
maybe from the trials

4
00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:01.535
and storms you face this week in life, uh, that we can

5
00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:04.215
not get away from those fully,

6
00:01:04.315 --> 00:01:06.055
but we can support each other in those.

7
00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:09.015
And so we pray that that would be true for us today.

8
00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:10.855
In fact, that's what we're gonna talk about,

9
00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:12.575
the importance of the church.

10
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:14.535
So go ahead and take your copy of God's word

11
00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:16.015
and turn with me

12
00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:19.575
to first Timothy three, first Timothy three.

13
00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:20.575
Maybe use your device.

14
00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:22.295
You can, uh, scroll to that,

15
00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:23.615
but to remember, if you have the app,

16
00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:25.815
we have the sermon notes on there if you wanna take those

17
00:01:25.815 --> 00:01:28.575
digitally or the paper copy of course as well.

18
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:33.615
But as you can see in our theological jar over the last

19
00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.935
seven weeks, we have, uh,

20
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.655
been talking about the big rocks of our faith.

21
00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:42.175
The first things first, foundational ideas

22
00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:46.575
and beliefs, doctrines that make us distinctly Christian.

23
00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:48.055
The core elements.

24
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.935
What what we're gonna do today is we're gonna shift to the

25
00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.375
smaller rocks, the secondary issues,

26
00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:59.895
some secondary second tier matters of our faith,

27
00:02:00.035 --> 00:02:03.735
the smaller rocks that fit in around the big rocks,

28
00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:06.215
which we put in first of course.

29
00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:10.315
And we're only gonna look at one of those today of course,

30
00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:11.875
and there's a lot more in there.

31
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.435
Don't think there are that many second tier issues in our

32
00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:16.675
phase, just don't, it's just for illustration purposes.

33
00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:18.595
Get that. Uh, but we're only gonna look at

34
00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.755
one of those today.

35
00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:22.795
There's, there's the idea again of how these fit in

36
00:02:22.815 --> 00:02:24.195
around the big rocks.

37
00:02:24.195 --> 00:02:26.875
And so you can see as I put this one in, it kind

38
00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:28.675
of fits in some of the gaps there.

39
00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:31.235
You can see that there's air underneath.

40
00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:33.315
We can put some more rocks there and here.

41
00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:36.155
And, and so that's the idea. We put the big rocks in first.

42
00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:37.675
If we put the small rocks in first,

43
00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:39.475
we can't fit the big ones in.

44
00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:42.915
And so we put the big rocks first, the first things first,

45
00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:46.915
and then we go from there with these second tier issues.

46
00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:50.795
Now, what we're saying about these secondary issues,

47
00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.955
what we mean with these are things that,

48
00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:58.035
that believers differ on that create then different churches

49
00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:00.845
or different denominations of churches.

50
00:03:02.145 --> 00:03:04.485
Now, we're not saying that those people

51
00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:06.925
who have different opinions on second tier issues,

52
00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:09.605
we're not saying that those people are not believers

53
00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:14.805
because if they have the same first tier big rock beliefs

54
00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:18.485
and if they have the same core doctrines as we do, then,

55
00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:20.965
then we would say they're also Christian.

56
00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.265
But what we're talking about these smaller rocks are a few

57
00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:26.465
things that cause a lot of heat

58
00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:28.585
whenever they're debated things

59
00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:33.465
that will have created significant boundaries that arise due

60
00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:38.065
to interpretations of specific ways of handling church

61
00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:39.705
and other things in our faith.

62
00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.225
So lemme give you an example, help you understand

63
00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:44.385
what we're talking about with second tier issues.

64
00:03:44.485 --> 00:03:47.105
One example is the meaning and mode of baptism.

65
00:03:48.045 --> 00:03:50.385
So some churches will baptize babies

66
00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:53.425
because they see that as a sign of the covenant.

67
00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:55.945
Like in the Old Testament circumcision, there's a sign

68
00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:58.905
of the covenant and they're including that as a way

69
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.625
to illustrate the same kind of idea.

70
00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:02.905
Well, we would differ on that

71
00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:06.385
and say we're baptizing those who profess faith in Christ.

72
00:04:06.445 --> 00:04:08.585
You have a a credible profession,

73
00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:11.345
which is why we baptize no babies, but,

74
00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:14.065
but people who can say, here's what I believe.

75
00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:17.945
So there's a difference there, right? Here's another one.

76
00:04:18.615 --> 00:04:20.545
Some people would say, some churches would say

77
00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:23.465
that the main evidence that someone is saved,

78
00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:26.225
that the Holy Spirit has come in their life, is that

79
00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:28.585
that person would speak in unknown languages.

80
00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:32.905
Well, we would differ and say that that's a spiritual gift

81
00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:35.625
for some, that that's not the primary evidence

82
00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:38.785
of everyone who's filled with the spirit of salvation.

83
00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:44.105
So you can see why those differences would prevent us from

84
00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:46.505
being together in the same local church.

85
00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:49.985
Again, we're not saying they're not believers, we're saying

86
00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:53.105
that there's a, a difference of the way that order

87
00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:54.305
of services would go

88
00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:58.185
or the way that we would be together in fellowship about how

89
00:04:58.185 --> 00:04:59.905
to baptize certain people or not.

90
00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:02.985
So that's why there's distinctions among churches

91
00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:05.625
and these denominations.

92
00:05:06.825 --> 00:05:08.245
And so we're gonna get to another one

93
00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:09.925
of these smaller rocks today

94
00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:12.085
as we look into one Timothy three,

95
00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:14.525
we're gonna uncover ecclesiology.

96
00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:16.605
Now, those did deal with the church as well,

97
00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:18.445
but ecclesiology is simply a big word

98
00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:20.045
that means the study of the church.

99
00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:23.565
And so how to, how to handle it,

100
00:05:23.565 --> 00:05:24.885
it's structure, it's purpose.

101
00:05:24.885 --> 00:05:28.445
We're gonna see some distinctions we have as a church

102
00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:32.165
that would differ from others in this second tier idea.

103
00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:33.525
So first Timothy three,

104
00:05:33.735 --> 00:05:35.805
we're gonna start in verse 14 for now.

105
00:05:36.665 --> 00:05:39.285
I'm gonna read down through the verse 16 to start with.

106
00:05:42.735 --> 00:05:43.855
I hope to come to you soon,

107
00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:45.695
but I'm writing these things to you.

108
00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.655
This is a personal letter, Paul to Timothy.

109
00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:50.975
I'm writing these things to you so that if I delay,

110
00:05:51.475 --> 00:05:54.615
you may know how one ought to behave in the household

111
00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:58.965
of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar

112
00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.405
and buttress of the truth.

113
00:06:01.815 --> 00:06:05.885
Great indeed, we confess is the mystery of godliness.

114
00:06:07.225 --> 00:06:10.485
He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the spirit,

115
00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:13.765
seen by angels proclaimed among the nations

116
00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:18.445
believed on in the world taken up in glory.

117
00:06:20.855 --> 00:06:22.235
God, we know this is your word.

118
00:06:22.895 --> 00:06:24.595
Yes, Paul wrote this letter to Timothy,

119
00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:28.035
but God we know that you included this for us today as well.

120
00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:31.275
So give us eyes and ears to see

121
00:06:31.275 --> 00:06:33.555
and hear what you want us to see and hear.

122
00:06:33.555 --> 00:06:36.035
Give us hearts that are ready, good soil

123
00:06:36.135 --> 00:06:37.315
to receive your word

124
00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:40.915
and plant it deep into us that we bear good fruit

125
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.995
as a result of just talking about the church.

126
00:06:46.535 --> 00:06:49.275
Or shape us into people who are not just hearers

127
00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:52.955
of the word, but are doers of it as well for your glory

128
00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:54.235
and our good others.

129
00:06:54.305 --> 00:06:57.675
Good, thank you. In Jesus' name. Amen.

130
00:06:59.895 --> 00:07:02.555
So this whole book of one Timothy is Paul,

131
00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:05.355
the apostle Paul writing a training manual

132
00:07:05.735 --> 00:07:06.915
to his protege Timothy,

133
00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:10.635
who is a young pastor in a city called Ephesus in the Middle

134
00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:12.915
East, uh, in Turkey these days.

135
00:07:13.135 --> 00:07:15.835
But, but that's what he was writing was this entire letter

136
00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.995
to say, here's here's what the church is,

137
00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:19.395
here's how to handle the church.

138
00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:21.555
Make sure you do it these ways.

139
00:07:21.695 --> 00:07:23.035
But we need to back up a second

140
00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:25.675
and ask even a fundamental question before we get to that.

141
00:07:26.585 --> 00:07:28.675
What is the church like?

142
00:07:28.675 --> 00:07:29.915
What even is the church

143
00:07:30.615 --> 00:07:32.155
before we even talk about how

144
00:07:32.155 --> 00:07:33.475
to structure it or how to handle it?

145
00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:34.875
What even is it?

146
00:07:36.075 --> 00:07:38.005
Well, that's why we started with these three verses

147
00:07:38.005 --> 00:07:41.125
because the first thing we learn is that the true church,

148
00:07:41.265 --> 00:07:45.285
the church is both truth and Christ based.

149
00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:51.845
The church is both truth and Christ based.

150
00:07:51.995 --> 00:07:56.285
That means it is founded on, as Ephesians two says,

151
00:07:56.665 --> 00:07:59.085
on the truth, founded on the truth.

152
00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:02.765
That's what he's meaning with this pillar and buttress idea.

153
00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:05.445
We don't use that second word very often

154
00:08:05.665 --> 00:08:08.165
and it doesn't mean that we're holding up the truth like

155
00:08:08.165 --> 00:08:12.485
it's leaning on us, but again, we're founded on it

156
00:08:12.905 --> 00:08:15.445
and we're charged with keeping it held fast.

157
00:08:16.185 --> 00:08:17.445
So that's what a buttress does.

158
00:08:17.465 --> 00:08:19.765
If you've never seen one before, it's meant

159
00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:21.925
to like hold the wall up a little bit.

160
00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.285
It's supporting it.

161
00:08:23.465 --> 00:08:24.805
It doesn't mean it's the source,

162
00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:26.245
it just means it's supporting.

163
00:08:27.265 --> 00:08:30.125
So it's similar to our value as a church of anchoring truth,

164
00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:33.925
where we talk about that in such a way that we are anchored

165
00:08:34.065 --> 00:08:35.565
by the truth of God,

166
00:08:36.955 --> 00:08:41.615
but then we're also to hold it fast in the winds of culture

167
00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:43.655
that are blowing so strongly around us,

168
00:08:43.705 --> 00:08:46.775
we're anchoring the truth as it needs to.

169
00:08:47.885 --> 00:08:50.825
That's reflected here. Verse 16, he talks about, uh,

170
00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:53.425
this familiar, probably at their time, familiar hymn,

171
00:08:53.515 --> 00:08:55.925
maybe they were singing this or a creed.

172
00:08:56.195 --> 00:08:59.605
They, they were reciting just to remind them of the truth

173
00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:02.905
about Christ, right?

174
00:09:02.905 --> 00:09:05.665
You saw that verse 16, he, that's Christ was

175
00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:09.705
manifested in the flesh, visible, vindicated by the spirit,

176
00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:13.705
proven seen by angels proclaimed among the nations,

177
00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:16.945
believed on in the world, taken up in glory.

178
00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:20.425
In some sense, that's like the foundational elements

179
00:09:20.425 --> 00:09:21.985
of the gospel, the truth.

180
00:09:22.765 --> 00:09:23.745
So he's going through, he's saying,

181
00:09:23.765 --> 00:09:25.225
here's what the truth is.

182
00:09:25.225 --> 00:09:29.185
You must base everything off of and it's about Christ.

183
00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:35.005
And so this matters for us today in at least one way

184
00:09:37.355 --> 00:09:41.165
that we need to understand any organization that would

185
00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:45.795
call itself a church is lying

186
00:09:46.655 --> 00:09:50.195
if it's not founded on the whole truth of God's word

187
00:09:50.705 --> 00:09:54.755
with Christ as the cornerstone, right?

188
00:09:54.755 --> 00:09:56.995
There's any organization can call themselves whatever they

189
00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:59.995
want to unless it's based on the truth of God's word

190
00:10:00.015 --> 00:10:01.475
and the cornerstone of Christ.

191
00:10:01.665 --> 00:10:06.565
It's not a church. It may say it is, but it's not.

192
00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:09.565
And we may, we must know that it's truth and Christ based.

193
00:10:09.565 --> 00:10:11.525
That's what a church should be.

194
00:10:14.045 --> 00:10:16.185
We can also look to the word itself, church

195
00:10:16.685 --> 00:10:19.345
to help us understand a little bit of def definition.

196
00:10:19.345 --> 00:10:21.825
What the church is. Now we're gonna put it on the screen.

197
00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:23.865
It's in the original Greek language.

198
00:10:24.005 --> 00:10:26.865
The word we know is church is eia.

199
00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:29.505
Let's all practice our Greek together for a second.

200
00:10:29.605 --> 00:10:32.505
You can see it right there. Eia, right?

201
00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:34.905
All sound like scholars. That's great.

202
00:10:35.365 --> 00:10:37.785
Um, you can see the little hyphen over the eye.

203
00:10:37.785 --> 00:10:39.345
That means the emphasis is on that. Okay? Never.

204
00:10:39.345 --> 00:10:40.585
We don't need to worry about that right now.

205
00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:44.065
So, um, the word cia.

206
00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:48.105
Now, you can't always take a Greek word and break it apart

207
00:10:48.205 --> 00:10:51.665
and make it actually work, but in this case it does.

208
00:10:52.495 --> 00:10:53.625
There's sometimes it doesn't.

209
00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:57.505
But the word eck, the beginning, the the prefix eck, EK,

210
00:10:57.975 --> 00:10:59.465
that means out of,

211
00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:04.185
but then the root word of the cia, the rest of it kaleo.

212
00:11:04.285 --> 00:11:06.225
In Greek, it means to call.

213
00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:11.355
And so when you look at that word, it means

214
00:11:12.135 --> 00:11:15.955
to us it's in English, it's church back then in Greek.

215
00:11:16.055 --> 00:11:20.505
It means called out ones that that's

216
00:11:21.125 --> 00:11:23.025
at the root of that word itself.

217
00:11:23.365 --> 00:11:27.625
Called out ones when it's talking about the church.

218
00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:32.915
Now remember what Paul was probably referring first

219
00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:37.235
to here was the universal church or the invisible church.

220
00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:40.835
Uh, we, we talk maybe about the global church,

221
00:11:41.295 --> 00:11:43.475
but this is bigger than just where people are right now.

222
00:11:43.475 --> 00:11:47.155
This is universal. Anybody who's ever believed in Christ is

223
00:11:47.155 --> 00:11:49.195
part of this, usually capitalized.

224
00:11:49.415 --> 00:11:54.325
See church, this universal invisible church,

225
00:11:54.465 --> 00:11:55.765
all believers of all time.

226
00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:57.725
That's yes, the church,

227
00:11:59.215 --> 00:12:00.995
but he's also, since he's writing this

228
00:12:00.995 --> 00:12:03.595
to Timothy in Ephesus, he's referring also

229
00:12:03.595 --> 00:12:07.825
to the visible church that was Ephesus.

230
00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:12.295
This is us here, the visible church.

231
00:12:12.775 --> 00:12:16.575
A local expression of that universal global body.

232
00:12:18.825 --> 00:12:20.125
Now it's a subset, yes,

233
00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:23.725
but it's still a subset of the called out ones.

234
00:12:24.025 --> 00:12:25.085
So that would be us.

235
00:12:25.135 --> 00:12:28.605
Every church that is truth in Christ base is called out.

236
00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:33.125
Ones called out as what called out

237
00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:34.325
as a covenant community

238
00:12:34.325 --> 00:12:38.355
before a covenant God, a relationship based on promises

239
00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:41.795
from God to us that we can then return back

240
00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:42.995
to him a covenant community

241
00:12:43.055 --> 00:12:46.635
before a covenant God called out of the world,

242
00:12:47.995 --> 00:12:50.125
made holy by God.

243
00:12:52.525 --> 00:12:56.545
So much so that the New Testament calls us as believers,

244
00:12:57.005 --> 00:13:01.235
saints not where you're gonna get your picture on the wall

245
00:13:01.235 --> 00:13:02.515
and people are gonna like worship you.

246
00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:04.675
No, not we're talking about that. We're talking about saints

247
00:13:04.775 --> 00:13:06.835
in the biblical term where you are standing

248
00:13:06.855 --> 00:13:10.075
before God, holy, righteous, clean.

249
00:13:11.455 --> 00:13:13.555
That's the beauty of what he's done

250
00:13:13.815 --> 00:13:16.555
to call us out of darkness.

251
00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:21.235
Sin our shame our past called us out of that into something.

252
00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:26.775
His community of saints, this is what he's done

253
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.985
for us, called out ones.

254
00:13:32.905 --> 00:13:35.365
So those are helpful tools for us to understand.

255
00:13:35.425 --> 00:13:38.285
Now, thankfully, God's word also gives us some metaphors,

256
00:13:38.715 --> 00:13:41.165
some pictures to help us understand the

257
00:13:41.445 --> 00:13:42.565
spiritual reality of the church.

258
00:13:42.565 --> 00:13:46.205
Even better. One of them is right here in verse 15.

259
00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:47.245
We read it a second ago.

260
00:13:47.915 --> 00:13:51.935
What did it call us that you might ought to behave in the

261
00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:55.005
what household of God.

262
00:13:55.945 --> 00:13:57.125
So that's the first metaphor.

263
00:13:57.125 --> 00:14:00.205
We're gonna look at this household of God.

264
00:14:01.855 --> 00:14:04.235
Now wait a second, I just said the church is this global

265
00:14:04.375 --> 00:14:07.115
entity, this empire that lasts beyond time.

266
00:14:07.335 --> 00:14:10.395
And but no, no, actually it's also

267
00:14:11.555 --> 00:14:15.875
a tight knit group bonded by familial ties.

268
00:14:18.765 --> 00:14:22.185
Now I know the word family

269
00:14:24.075 --> 00:14:25.925
conjuress up some pretty negative images

270
00:14:26.025 --> 00:14:27.405
for some of us in this room right now.

271
00:14:27.905 --> 00:14:31.885
And you've heard us say church family or family of God.

272
00:14:31.885 --> 00:14:34.365
And that's a really negative thing in your life

273
00:14:34.365 --> 00:14:35.805
because of the background you have

274
00:14:36.225 --> 00:14:37.445
and experiences you've had,

275
00:14:39.085 --> 00:14:41.635
which is why I think household may be a better term

276
00:14:41.635 --> 00:14:44.595
because it gets away from some of the negativity of family

277
00:14:45.505 --> 00:14:49.395
household, which is usually diverse when you look at that.

278
00:14:49.535 --> 00:14:50.995
But, but the reality here,

279
00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:54.405
we can't get away from the reality is that by faith

280
00:14:55.355 --> 00:14:57.845
through the one spirit to the Father,

281
00:14:59.655 --> 00:15:02.945
believers we are made to be children of God.

282
00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:04.965
He is our father,

283
00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:07.885
that we're brothers with Christ in a sense.

284
00:15:07.885 --> 00:15:11.285
We're inheritance. His inheritance is ours.

285
00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:14.405
We're heirs with Christ that that we are a part

286
00:15:14.505 --> 00:15:19.125
of the household of God, the family of God that's pure

287
00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:20.125
and right in the end.

288
00:15:22.295 --> 00:15:27.275
How important is that image right now in a world

289
00:15:27.275 --> 00:15:31.815
that's filled with loneliness division,

290
00:15:35.515 --> 00:15:39.805
this, this is the place that we ought

291
00:15:39.825 --> 00:15:42.845
to be able to love one another like true family.

292
00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:45.505
That the lonely should

293
00:15:45.505 --> 00:15:46.705
feel like they're a part of the family.

294
00:15:46.935 --> 00:15:48.025
That the divisions

295
00:15:48.025 --> 00:15:51.225
of the world should be just minimized here inside

296
00:15:51.225 --> 00:15:52.905
because we're a family and we care

297
00:15:53.135 --> 00:15:57.205
that deeply about each other, the household

298
00:15:57.465 --> 00:15:58.645
of God.

299
00:16:01.545 --> 00:16:02.925
Now here's the problem with that.

300
00:16:03.825 --> 00:16:06.635
That means we can also wound one another like family.

301
00:16:10.855 --> 00:16:15.175
But we must, when you think about the word fellowship,

302
00:16:16.115 --> 00:16:19.215
the word koinonia is the original Greek word for that.

303
00:16:19.275 --> 00:16:21.895
And there's so much more than just eating a meal together.

304
00:16:23.275 --> 00:16:26.285
It's this in-depth connection that you have with people

305
00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:30.085
who are not like you, but you love like family.

306
00:16:30.785 --> 00:16:33.525
And there's true heart level

307
00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:36.365
concern for each other.

308
00:16:38.905 --> 00:16:42.355
This should be the family, the household of God.

309
00:16:45.455 --> 00:16:46.625
Well that's not the only image.

310
00:16:46.775 --> 00:16:48.945
There's a second image that we're gonna talk about today,

311
00:16:49.045 --> 00:16:50.385
the temple of God.

312
00:16:51.245 --> 00:16:53.345
The New Testament paints a picture of us

313
00:16:53.525 --> 00:16:56.705
as the church being the temple of God.

314
00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:02.365
Here's how Ephesians two says it, as Paul is referring

315
00:17:02.365 --> 00:17:05.205
to the church and the unity between Jews and Gentiles

316
00:17:05.545 --> 00:17:08.165
and how Christ is the foundation of that,

317
00:17:08.345 --> 00:17:09.445
the cornerstone of that.

318
00:17:09.665 --> 00:17:13.165
He says this Verse 21, in whom in Christ, the whole

319
00:17:13.805 --> 00:17:16.245
structure being joined together

320
00:17:17.015 --> 00:17:20.045
grows into a holy temple in the Lord.

321
00:17:21.465 --> 00:17:23.765
So he's painting a picture of, of a building, right?

322
00:17:23.925 --> 00:17:26.405
A physical building. He's looking at them at the people

323
00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:27.645
and he's saying, you guys are

324
00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:28.885
like the bricks of the building.

325
00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:32.725
The stones one Peter two says the same thing.

326
00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:35.805
You yourselves like living stones being built up

327
00:17:36.225 --> 00:17:40.615
as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood,

328
00:17:40.955 --> 00:17:43.135
to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable

329
00:17:43.135 --> 00:17:44.335
to God through Jesus Christ.

330
00:17:44.435 --> 00:17:45.655
That's all temple language.

331
00:17:47.245 --> 00:17:48.695
This is where the worship happens.

332
00:17:48.695 --> 00:17:51.605
This is is where the, the idea happens of, of responding

333
00:17:51.605 --> 00:17:52.965
to God and meeting with God.

334
00:17:54.385 --> 00:17:56.705
I mean, just think about the original temple.

335
00:17:56.815 --> 00:17:59.465
What was it for by the way, that's not the original picture.

336
00:17:59.465 --> 00:18:00.825
They didn't have cameras back then,

337
00:18:01.085 --> 00:18:02.785
but that's just what we think it might've looked like.

338
00:18:04.545 --> 00:18:09.115
That temple for those people back then was not just any old

339
00:18:09.275 --> 00:18:12.415
building, it was the place

340
00:18:13.465 --> 00:18:15.295
God's presence showed up.

341
00:18:17.485 --> 00:18:20.625
It was the place they came to meet with God.

342
00:18:20.965 --> 00:18:23.705
And if we are now called the temple of God together,

343
00:18:24.235 --> 00:18:25.345
think about what that means.

344
00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:28.645
It it means that, that

345
00:18:28.645 --> 00:18:31.005
because God's spirit lives in us

346
00:18:31.365 --> 00:18:34.795
individually as believers.

347
00:18:35.745 --> 00:18:38.475
Then when we come together, one Corinthians says,

348
00:18:38.625 --> 00:18:41.275
when we come together in a unique

349
00:18:41.615 --> 00:18:44.875
and special way, God is with us

350
00:18:46.095 --> 00:18:47.725
and his presence is among us.

351
00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:52.365
We are the temple that we

352
00:18:52.365 --> 00:18:53.525
don't have to go to a building anymore.

353
00:18:53.825 --> 00:18:57.605
The people, we are his dwelling place.

354
00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:04.055
In fact, I love what one Corinthians 14 says about that.

355
00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:09.325
See one Corinthians 14 is talking about order of services

356
00:19:09.385 --> 00:19:12.165
and how, like how the chaos of this could get to that.

357
00:19:12.545 --> 00:19:14.845
And he's just saying, no, we need to be, we need

358
00:19:14.845 --> 00:19:15.845
to be ordered in things.

359
00:19:15.865 --> 00:19:17.365
But he says this in an interesting way.

360
00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:20.725
Paul writes where he says, the way we worship

361
00:19:22.475 --> 00:19:25.175
as believers, the way we interact together

362
00:19:25.595 --> 00:19:28.615
as believers should lead someone who's an outsider.

363
00:19:28.635 --> 00:19:31.295
It says, somebody who's new walks in the room,

364
00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:33.615
walks into the body together

365
00:19:33.995 --> 00:19:38.015
and says, God is truly among you

366
00:19:40.425 --> 00:19:42.715
that the way those people were worshiping,

367
00:19:42.815 --> 00:19:45.195
the way we should be worshiping as the temple of God,

368
00:19:45.195 --> 00:19:46.675
the way we should be interacting together

369
00:19:46.735 --> 00:19:50.755
as priests in the temple of God says to someone who walks in

370
00:19:50.755 --> 00:19:53.515
who has no idea and they walk in

371
00:19:53.515 --> 00:19:57.325
and say, wow, God is

372
00:19:57.375 --> 00:19:59.125
among this group of people.

373
00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:00.365
God is truly here.

374
00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:04.655
Can we be praying for that?

375
00:20:06.655 --> 00:20:09.265
That someone who has no other connection walks in

376
00:20:09.265 --> 00:20:13.465
and says, I, I feel I sense God is among you

377
00:20:15.355 --> 00:20:17.535
merely because of the way we worship, the way we interact.

378
00:20:17.745 --> 00:20:21.415
Let's pray for that. The temple of God.

379
00:20:23.915 --> 00:20:26.935
Here's the third one. We are called the people

380
00:20:27.155 --> 00:20:28.735
of God in the New Testament,

381
00:20:29.805 --> 00:20:32.545
the church is the people of God.

382
00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:37.015
This is one Peter two, nine

383
00:20:37.015 --> 00:20:41.295
and 10 says, you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,

384
00:20:41.775 --> 00:20:45.655
a holy nation, a people for his own possession

385
00:20:46.085 --> 00:20:48.095
that you may proclaim the excellencies of him

386
00:20:48.115 --> 00:20:50.775
who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light

387
00:20:51.405 --> 00:20:54.655
once you were not a people, but now you are God's people.

388
00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.695
Once you had not received mercy,

389
00:20:57.035 --> 00:20:59.935
but now you have received mercy.

390
00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:05.025
What Peter's doing is he's calling back to the exodus,

391
00:21:06.405 --> 00:21:09.645
remember where God redeemed Israel out of slavery in Egypt?

392
00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:13.525
What did he redeem them out for? Just to give them freedom.

393
00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:17.125
No. Exodus six, seven, God says, I will take you

394
00:21:17.185 --> 00:21:20.725
to be my people and I will be your God.

395
00:21:20.865 --> 00:21:22.365
You shall know that I'm the Lord your God

396
00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:25.965
who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

397
00:21:27.275 --> 00:21:29.485
That same phrase is repeated over and over

398
00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:31.485
and over in the Old Testament till finally,

399
00:21:31.495 --> 00:21:33.565
Peter picks it up in one Peter two

400
00:21:33.665 --> 00:21:36.005
and says, those who believe are the ones

401
00:21:36.005 --> 00:21:38.125
who are God's people, those who have been called out

402
00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:39.205
of darkness of sin

403
00:21:39.265 --> 00:21:41.285
and shame into his marvelous light,

404
00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:43.285
freed from slavery into freedom.

405
00:21:43.945 --> 00:21:48.235
You are his people now. You are God's people.

406
00:21:48.815 --> 00:21:50.675
And listen, when we talk about being God's people,

407
00:21:50.675 --> 00:21:51.795
we're talking about a new nation.

408
00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:54.255
We're talking about something

409
00:21:54.445 --> 00:21:58.695
that supersedes every other relational tie, family tie,

410
00:21:59.175 --> 00:22:00.615
national tie that we may have here.

411
00:22:00.915 --> 00:22:04.255
The kingdom of God is a new nation, a new people

412
00:22:04.405 --> 00:22:07.495
that supersedes all of it because it lasts eternally.

413
00:22:07.835 --> 00:22:09.975
And because it goes to all the nations,

414
00:22:10.355 --> 00:22:11.495
not just this one we live in,

415
00:22:14.445 --> 00:22:17.745
we must not allow anyone to doubt

416
00:22:18.555 --> 00:22:20.225
where our true allegiance lies.

417
00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:25.835
We still live here. We still have responsibilities.

418
00:22:27.135 --> 00:22:29.675
But remember, we're a part of something that is internal.

419
00:22:30.245 --> 00:22:32.515
We're a part of a people that are eternal.

420
00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:34.795
Which by the way, that's Revelation 21.

421
00:22:35.085 --> 00:22:37.435
Verse three says, talking about the end,

422
00:22:37.435 --> 00:22:38.515
listen to what this says.

423
00:22:38.635 --> 00:22:40.795
I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,

424
00:22:40.895 --> 00:22:44.355
behold the dwelling place of God is with mankind.

425
00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:47.715
He will dwell with them and they will be his people.

426
00:22:48.935 --> 00:22:50.835
That's not the nation idea.

427
00:22:51.145 --> 00:22:54.965
This is a new eternal group of people

428
00:22:54.965 --> 00:22:58.805
that supersedes everything else we're tied to here.

429
00:22:59.665 --> 00:23:01.925
Our true allegiance is there.

430
00:23:03.095 --> 00:23:05.275
The people, the people of God

431
00:23:07.855 --> 00:23:09.765
we're called the flock of God as well.

432
00:23:10.905 --> 00:23:14.755
This passage, uh, in one Peter five talking to pastors,

433
00:23:14.975 --> 00:23:19.315
he refers to twice the flock talking about the church.

434
00:23:21.065 --> 00:23:23.005
So he's referring to the local church

435
00:23:24.875 --> 00:23:28.025
where Christ is the chief shepherd, of course.

436
00:23:29.485 --> 00:23:31.665
But that still means we're all part of God's flock.

437
00:23:32.355 --> 00:23:35.385
We're part of this flock and part of God's flock.

438
00:23:35.445 --> 00:23:36.465
And and what that means.

439
00:23:36.525 --> 00:23:38.905
If we are sheep as a part of a flock, that means some things

440
00:23:38.905 --> 00:23:41.765
that we're messy, we're noisy.

441
00:23:43.815 --> 00:23:46.605
We're often confused like these sheep seem to be right now.

442
00:23:50.175 --> 00:23:51.995
We even bite each other at times.

443
00:23:55.345 --> 00:23:56.805
But also think about what the flock

444
00:23:56.945 --> 00:24:01.095
has as the flock of God.

445
00:24:01.095 --> 00:24:03.775
We have a good shepherd who lays his life down

446
00:24:03.835 --> 00:24:07.595
for his sheep, who protects us,

447
00:24:09.095 --> 00:24:12.155
who surrounds us, who goes

448
00:24:12.155 --> 00:24:13.915
after the one leaves, the nine nine and goes

449
00:24:13.915 --> 00:24:15.035
after the one who wandered off.

450
00:24:17.475 --> 00:24:20.735
So to be the flock, yes, that's humbling that we're sheep,

451
00:24:22.685 --> 00:24:24.225
but it's also good news that we've got

452
00:24:24.225 --> 00:24:25.505
this shepherd that we do.

453
00:24:28.315 --> 00:24:29.535
So we're the flock of God.

454
00:24:31.695 --> 00:24:32.755
And there's many other images

455
00:24:32.815 --> 00:24:34.835
of scripture showing us the church.

456
00:24:34.855 --> 00:24:35.955
But I wanna highlight one more,

457
00:24:36.705 --> 00:24:38.475
that the church is the body of Christ.

458
00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:41.445
This may be one of the most familiar ones.

459
00:24:41.445 --> 00:24:45.705
The body of Christ, one Corinthians 12 is

460
00:24:45.705 --> 00:24:50.025
so detailed about this interconnectedness of the body,

461
00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:53.585
how important it is for each part of the body and,

462
00:24:53.585 --> 00:24:55.785
and how Christ is the head of the body.

463
00:24:55.805 --> 00:24:59.325
But we are all a part of the body and

464
00:24:59.325 --> 00:25:01.885
and we inherently understand this metaphor.

465
00:25:01.945 --> 00:25:03.525
So I wanna give you some time

466
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.245
to engage with this for a second.

467
00:25:05.345 --> 00:25:07.725
So reach down and whether it's a Bible or a pen

468
00:25:07.725 --> 00:25:09.765
or a cup of coffee or whatever, it's just pick something up.

469
00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:13.085
Just hold it. Just reach down, pick something up.

470
00:25:16.105 --> 00:25:17.765
Now I, I want you to think for a second

471
00:25:18.145 --> 00:25:22.525
how much was involved in you just doing that One thing,

472
00:25:24.175 --> 00:25:25.675
you didn't think about it when you were doing it

473
00:25:25.915 --> 00:25:27.555
'cause it's just part of what your body does.

474
00:25:27.615 --> 00:25:30.235
But think about the muscles had to work,

475
00:25:31.015 --> 00:25:34.475
the bone structure had to hold your muscles up.

476
00:25:34.615 --> 00:25:39.035
The nerves had to fire in that the, the eyes had

477
00:25:39.035 --> 00:25:40.755
to look about what you're going to pick up.

478
00:25:40.825 --> 00:25:44.475
Your nerves fired, then your heart was pumping blood through

479
00:25:44.475 --> 00:25:45.635
that to your lungs.

480
00:25:45.635 --> 00:25:47.675
Were oxygenating your blood so it works, right?

481
00:25:47.895 --> 00:25:49.075
You could go on and on, right?

482
00:25:50.635 --> 00:25:53.855
All just to pick up your Bible or a pen or whatever else.

483
00:25:56.905 --> 00:26:00.245
And so we get this, we inherently understand this metaphor

484
00:26:00.245 --> 00:26:03.405
that each body part has a role to play

485
00:26:05.405 --> 00:26:08.655
that if they don't, the rest of the body's hindered.

486
00:26:08.655 --> 00:26:12.695
We understand that when you're injured, the body can't do

487
00:26:12.695 --> 00:26:13.735
what it's supposed to do.

488
00:26:17.105 --> 00:26:20.195
Just think about that. If we as the church are the body

489
00:26:20.215 --> 00:26:25.025
of Christ, Christ is the head, we are then his hands,

490
00:26:25.095 --> 00:26:29.535
feet, body, are you that connected

491
00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:31.935
with other parts of the body

492
00:26:33.355 --> 00:26:35.425
where you feel if someone doesn't

493
00:26:35.525 --> 00:26:38.185
or if they, they feel if you don't perform

494
00:26:38.215 --> 00:26:40.585
what you're supposed do, are you that connected?

495
00:26:44.525 --> 00:26:47.185
Are you serving others and allowing them to serve you?

496
00:26:47.325 --> 00:26:50.905
Are you, are you giving generously to support other parts

497
00:26:50.905 --> 00:26:53.865
of the body financially when they're in need?

498
00:26:55.785 --> 00:26:58.485
Are you grieving with those who grieve

499
00:26:58.665 --> 00:27:02.085
as one Corinthians 12 talks about that you feel it when

500
00:27:03.435 --> 00:27:07.855
somebody's hurting or you're rejoicing when someone is

501
00:27:07.855 --> 00:27:10.305
honored, even if it means you're not getting

502
00:27:10.305 --> 00:27:11.545
honored, they're getting honored.

503
00:27:11.765 --> 00:27:13.385
The body is getting honored by that

504
00:27:14.425 --> 00:27:16.365
Christ is receiving the glory that,

505
00:27:16.505 --> 00:27:17.805
and you're rejoicing with.

506
00:27:18.025 --> 00:27:20.125
Are you that connect? Please listen.

507
00:27:21.965 --> 00:27:23.865
So much of church life in the last

508
00:27:24.815 --> 00:27:28.765
50 years in America has been this disconnected entity

509
00:27:28.765 --> 00:27:30.805
where we come, we sit, we listen, we leave.

510
00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:35.805
If we're the body of Christ, there's so much more to it.

511
00:27:41.475 --> 00:27:43.895
Now I, I share these five metaphors for a reason

512
00:27:45.115 --> 00:27:46.885
because I know I'm prone to this.

513
00:27:47.745 --> 00:27:50.325
We tend to think in one

514
00:27:50.325 --> 00:27:52.325
or two of those metaphors about the church.

515
00:27:53.295 --> 00:27:54.435
We pick our favorite and we

516
00:27:54.435 --> 00:27:55.515
say, well, we're the body of Christ.

517
00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:57.195
Or we pick that we're the flock

518
00:27:57.215 --> 00:27:58.355
and we're just sheep like that.

519
00:27:58.455 --> 00:28:00.755
We kind of land in one or two of those.

520
00:28:00.895 --> 00:28:03.875
So we have to deliberately move our minds to the others

521
00:28:04.425 --> 00:28:07.275
because we have a, we need to have a biblical understanding

522
00:28:07.275 --> 00:28:08.315
of the church, right?

523
00:28:08.335 --> 00:28:10.035
We might have forgotten some of these truths

524
00:28:10.035 --> 00:28:11.795
that we're the people of God, there's a new nation.

525
00:28:11.935 --> 00:28:13.355
We have allegiances, right?

526
00:28:13.535 --> 00:28:15.075
You can see how this can help us

527
00:28:15.605 --> 00:28:17.395
understand the church better.

528
00:28:20.505 --> 00:28:21.685
So that's the nature of the church.

529
00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:24.965
But then we, we need to know what the church's structure is.

530
00:28:24.965 --> 00:28:26.125
That's the next piece of this.

531
00:28:26.145 --> 00:28:29.085
As we talked about these smaller rocks getting into that,

532
00:28:29.155 --> 00:28:30.405
what is the church's structure,

533
00:28:30.435 --> 00:28:32.445
this local expression, how do we structure it?

534
00:28:34.055 --> 00:28:37.265
Well, it varies. And if you've been in church most

535
00:28:37.265 --> 00:28:40.305
of your life, you know that there's a variety of ways

536
00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:41.865
that people structure churches.

537
00:28:43.015 --> 00:28:45.065
Some churches have one pastor and a board of deacons.

538
00:28:46.335 --> 00:28:50.345
Some churches have an outside group overseeing the church.

539
00:28:51.735 --> 00:28:55.105
Some churches have women pastors. We don't. Others don't.

540
00:28:56.145 --> 00:28:58.915
Some churches have elders that are boards, elders

541
00:28:58.915 --> 00:29:00.595
that are council elders that are involved

542
00:29:00.615 --> 00:29:01.715
on staff non-Stop you.

543
00:29:01.715 --> 00:29:03.315
You see how there's a lot of variety.

544
00:29:03.455 --> 00:29:05.755
We could go even further than that.

545
00:29:05.755 --> 00:29:07.835
That's why there's more than one church in a city, right?

546
00:29:08.295 --> 00:29:10.755
That's why there are different interpretations leading

547
00:29:10.775 --> 00:29:12.075
to different denominations.

548
00:29:13.735 --> 00:29:16.755
We differ on these and other smaller rock items now.

549
00:29:16.775 --> 00:29:21.715
Now again, if they are core big rock people with us,

550
00:29:22.565 --> 00:29:23.945
we're on the same team.

551
00:29:25.615 --> 00:29:27.395
If they hold the same core doctrines,

552
00:29:27.395 --> 00:29:28.955
same basic beliefs, they're Christian too.

553
00:29:28.955 --> 00:29:30.795
Like I'm, I'm so thankful

554
00:29:30.815 --> 00:29:33.675
for churches like Faith Bible Church and Bridgeway

555
00:29:33.735 --> 00:29:34.875
and First Assembly

556
00:29:35.175 --> 00:29:36.915
and these others that are faithfully

557
00:29:37.145 --> 00:29:38.395
believing the same things.

558
00:29:38.455 --> 00:29:40.235
We believe about the core doctrines,

559
00:29:41.535 --> 00:29:43.155
yet we differ on some of the other stuff.

560
00:29:43.155 --> 00:29:44.195
They're different than we are.

561
00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:47.445
Yes, but we're on the same team with those

562
00:29:47.505 --> 00:29:49.805
who are believers as well.

563
00:29:50.145 --> 00:29:54.135
Yes, we're not competing against anybody remember that.

564
00:29:56.475 --> 00:30:00.005
But how do we do it here? What's our distinctive structure?

565
00:30:00.635 --> 00:30:03.645
Well, we get it in part from one Timothy three.

566
00:30:03.785 --> 00:30:06.325
So I skipped the first 13 verses.

567
00:30:06.415 --> 00:30:07.845
We're gonna go back and read those now.

568
00:30:08.715 --> 00:30:13.085
This is part of where we get a glimpse of our structure.

569
00:30:14.745 --> 00:30:16.405
So one Timothy three starting in verse one.

570
00:30:16.405 --> 00:30:18.865
Now the saying is trustworthy.

571
00:30:18.925 --> 00:30:21.425
If anyone aspires to the office of overseer,

572
00:30:21.425 --> 00:30:22.705
he desires a noble task.

573
00:30:23.175 --> 00:30:25.905
Therefore an overseer must be above reproach.

574
00:30:26.165 --> 00:30:29.225
The husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled,

575
00:30:29.335 --> 00:30:33.465
respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a drunkard,

576
00:30:33.605 --> 00:30:37.465
not violent, gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.

577
00:30:38.245 --> 00:30:40.745
He must manage his own household well with all dignity,

578
00:30:40.745 --> 00:30:42.465
keeping his children submissive.

579
00:30:42.465 --> 00:30:43.985
For if someone does not know how to care,

580
00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:45.465
manage his own household, he,

581
00:30:45.465 --> 00:30:46.785
how will he care for God's church?

582
00:30:48.005 --> 00:30:49.625
He must not be a recent converter.

583
00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:51.865
He'll become puffed up with conceit, falling

584
00:30:51.865 --> 00:30:53.065
to the condemnation of the devil.

585
00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:57.305
Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders so

586
00:30:57.305 --> 00:30:59.025
that he may not fall into disgrace,

587
00:30:59.055 --> 00:31:00.185
into a snare of the devil.

588
00:31:01.355 --> 00:31:04.325
Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double tongue,

589
00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:08.165
not addicted to much wine nor greedy for dishonest gain.

590
00:31:08.635 --> 00:31:10.325
They must hold the mystery of the faith

591
00:31:10.325 --> 00:31:11.405
with a clear conscience.

592
00:31:11.985 --> 00:31:14.525
Let them be tested first. Let them serve as deacons.

593
00:31:14.525 --> 00:31:17.365
If they prove themselves blameless, their wives

594
00:31:17.365 --> 00:31:19.525
likewise must be dignified, not slanderous,

595
00:31:19.535 --> 00:31:21.485
sober minded, faithful in all things.

596
00:31:22.305 --> 00:31:24.205
Let deacons each be the husband of one wife

597
00:31:24.885 --> 00:31:27.525
managing their children and their households well for those

598
00:31:27.525 --> 00:31:29.565
who serve well as deacons gain a good standing

599
00:31:29.585 --> 00:31:31.925
for themselves and also great confidence in the faith

600
00:31:31.925 --> 00:31:32.925
that is in Christ Jesus.

601
00:31:34.545 --> 00:31:37.805
And so you saw in just that little section,

602
00:31:38.585 --> 00:31:41.325
two distinct offices of the church, right?

603
00:31:42.115 --> 00:31:44.085
Overseers and deacons, it's the same thing, Paul,

604
00:31:44.195 --> 00:31:46.925
when he is writing to the Philippians, he says in verse one,

605
00:31:47.195 --> 00:31:48.605
Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ

606
00:31:48.905 --> 00:31:51.365
to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi

607
00:31:51.515 --> 00:31:54.285
with the overseers and deacons.

608
00:31:55.425 --> 00:31:57.525
So that's partly where we get our structure from.

609
00:31:58.735 --> 00:31:59.955
Now we say there are two offices.

610
00:32:00.195 --> 00:32:02.115
I, I'm gonna articulate four,

611
00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:04.635
but you'll see why there's still really only two.

612
00:32:05.895 --> 00:32:07.635
The first we would say is

613
00:32:07.635 --> 00:32:09.875
that Christ is the head of the church.

614
00:32:11.615 --> 00:32:13.355
No matter what structure you should have

615
00:32:13.355 --> 00:32:17.435
or would have, Christ is the head he rules over the church.

616
00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:19.635
And by the way, he's the only one who can fill that office.

617
00:32:20.375 --> 00:32:23.435
So it's not any rotation. He is theirs.

618
00:32:23.435 --> 00:32:25.075
That's why it's not really technically an office

619
00:32:25.255 --> 00:32:26.475
for us because he's there.

620
00:32:26.505 --> 00:32:29.475
He's never changing. But then second, you saw it here,

621
00:32:29.475 --> 00:32:30.715
that overseers.

622
00:32:32.495 --> 00:32:34.355
Now there's a lot of words in scripture used

623
00:32:34.355 --> 00:32:35.715
about leaders in the church.

624
00:32:35.855 --> 00:32:38.835
Elders, pastors, shepherds, overseers.

625
00:32:39.225 --> 00:32:40.965
We see those as pretty much synonymous

626
00:32:41.475 --> 00:32:43.685
that he's referencing people who are in

627
00:32:43.685 --> 00:32:44.925
that position, that office.

628
00:32:45.785 --> 00:32:47.085
So these are the servant leaders

629
00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:49.645
of the church, which we believe.

630
00:32:49.955 --> 00:32:52.245
Side note that there's a, a plurality

631
00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:54.245
of those when we see it in the New Testament.

632
00:32:54.275 --> 00:32:59.005
Meaning I'm one of your pastors, we have more than one.

633
00:32:59.225 --> 00:33:01.165
We believe that's a healthy, safe structure

634
00:33:01.265 --> 00:33:02.725
for us and for the church.

635
00:33:03.555 --> 00:33:05.855
But we see that in scripture, a plurality

636
00:33:05.995 --> 00:33:07.695
of elders in a local church.

637
00:33:09.315 --> 00:33:11.085
That was the second group. Now there's a third group,

638
00:33:11.195 --> 00:33:13.485
deacons, which we would call the leading servants

639
00:33:13.905 --> 00:33:16.205
of the church where they are to assist the pastors.

640
00:33:16.205 --> 00:33:17.605
They're there to, uh,

641
00:33:17.795 --> 00:33:19.605
meet practical needs within the church.

642
00:33:19.785 --> 00:33:22.845
See that Acts chapter six, all over scripture as well.

643
00:33:24.705 --> 00:33:27.365
Now, as a side note, I want you to to remember when we read

644
00:33:27.365 --> 00:33:30.305
that in one Timothy three, I hope you saw it.

645
00:33:31.255 --> 00:33:33.835
The primary qualification for elders

646
00:33:33.835 --> 00:33:36.805
and deacons is character.

647
00:33:38.865 --> 00:33:41.615
It's not wealth, it's not influence,

648
00:33:42.745 --> 00:33:45.575
it's not knowledge, it's integrity.

649
00:33:45.725 --> 00:33:49.715
It's character that supersedes every ability

650
00:33:49.775 --> 00:33:52.195
or every resource anybody has.

651
00:33:52.425 --> 00:33:53.915
It's that first.

652
00:33:56.435 --> 00:33:59.335
But then there's a fourth group of people in the church,

653
00:34:00.735 --> 00:34:02.145
Philippians one, one called 'em,

654
00:34:02.145 --> 00:34:04.105
the saints one Peter five, the flock.

655
00:34:04.975 --> 00:34:06.305
This is us, all of us

656
00:34:07.735 --> 00:34:10.425
that we the congregation are really the final

657
00:34:10.425 --> 00:34:11.825
governing authority in the church.

658
00:34:11.845 --> 00:34:13.825
But also we have responsibilities within the church.

659
00:34:14.005 --> 00:34:16.385
We are not just sit back and receiving passively.

660
00:34:16.565 --> 00:34:18.865
We are a part of the body

661
00:34:20.095 --> 00:34:22.355
to serve the rest of the body.

662
00:34:24.535 --> 00:34:27.395
And so again, I'm just going through basic structure here.

663
00:34:27.655 --> 00:34:30.155
You can see how these small rock things create churches

664
00:34:30.175 --> 00:34:32.595
and denominations that we differ on the

665
00:34:32.595 --> 00:34:33.995
interpretation of some of those things.

666
00:34:34.055 --> 00:34:36.115
But I don't wanna just focus on distinctions today.

667
00:34:36.535 --> 00:34:37.635
So here's what we're gonna end with.

668
00:34:39.775 --> 00:34:41.025
What is the church's task?

669
00:34:41.335 --> 00:34:42.385
Okay, we saw like

670
00:34:42.385 --> 00:34:44.585
what the church is structure, those kinda things.

671
00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:45.825
What, what is the church's task?

672
00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:48.585
Let's, let's focus on what we are to do.

673
00:34:52.445 --> 00:34:53.805
Remember, this is not just a social club,

674
00:34:55.785 --> 00:34:57.325
not just a service organization.

675
00:34:59.335 --> 00:35:01.185
What is the church to do?

676
00:35:01.185 --> 00:35:04.305
Here's three tasks I believe every church ought to be about.

677
00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:07.975
First one, worship God.

678
00:35:10.105 --> 00:35:13.405
The first worship God from the very beginning.

679
00:35:13.465 --> 00:35:14.685
The community of God's people.

680
00:35:15.045 --> 00:35:16.405
Remember out of Egypt, I called you.

681
00:35:16.405 --> 00:35:18.165
Why did he call them to worship him?

682
00:35:18.165 --> 00:35:21.285
He told Pharaoh that I'm calling my people out, freeing them

683
00:35:21.425 --> 00:35:23.325
so they can come worship me In the wilderness,

684
00:35:24.795 --> 00:35:27.215
we are called out ones to worship.

685
00:35:27.275 --> 00:35:30.375
That's why our primary task is to lift his name high,

686
00:35:30.555 --> 00:35:34.255
to glorify him, to declare his majesty

687
00:35:34.435 --> 00:35:37.925
and to declare our allegiance to him above all else.

688
00:35:39.745 --> 00:35:42.005
That's worship. Worship is not just singing.

689
00:35:43.195 --> 00:35:47.205
Worship is us responding to who he is and what he's done.

690
00:35:47.425 --> 00:35:48.605
Now we do that through singing.

691
00:35:49.265 --> 00:35:51.885
We do that through the Lord's supper, through baptisms,

692
00:35:52.235 --> 00:35:53.765
through giving financially.

693
00:35:54.305 --> 00:35:56.685
We do that through hearing his word,

694
00:35:56.775 --> 00:35:58.005
responding to it, right?

695
00:35:58.025 --> 00:36:02.185
That's all worship. The worship service

696
00:36:02.525 --> 00:36:03.745
is every part of it.

697
00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:06.545
From the time we start until the time we walk out the door.

698
00:36:07.615 --> 00:36:09.595
And I would even say even stuff out there is worship.

699
00:36:09.735 --> 00:36:11.315
As you're fellowing and, and talking

700
00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:12.475
and challenging and encouraging.

701
00:36:13.105 --> 00:36:15.675
It's not just worship when we sing,

702
00:36:17.605 --> 00:36:19.545
but that also means, listen, we shouldn't wash,

703
00:36:19.685 --> 00:36:23.655
we shouldn't walk in here primarily for us,

704
00:36:25.755 --> 00:36:26.925
what we can get out of this.

705
00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:30.165
I mean, I've heard people say, oh,

706
00:36:30.165 --> 00:36:31.325
I didn't get much outta worship today.

707
00:36:31.325 --> 00:36:33.005
Well that's, that's okay because it wasn't for you.

708
00:36:36.025 --> 00:36:37.375
We're here for him, right?

709
00:36:37.405 --> 00:36:41.775
Like we, we walk in here to offer offerings of praise

710
00:36:42.355 --> 00:36:44.535
to our God who has saved us.

711
00:36:46.325 --> 00:36:48.945
And so we receive reciprocal benefit from that. Yes.

712
00:36:48.965 --> 00:36:51.945
But it's primarily because we want to lift him up

713
00:36:52.005 --> 00:36:54.785
and glorify him above all else.

714
00:36:54.855 --> 00:36:56.585
What does he receive out of it?

715
00:36:56.585 --> 00:36:57.985
That should be our primary goal.

716
00:37:00.245 --> 00:37:02.625
So worship God, that's number one. We do that.

717
00:37:02.685 --> 00:37:05.585
Second, the church's task is to nurture believers.

718
00:37:06.615 --> 00:37:08.865
What is the church to do? Just base level worship.

719
00:37:09.085 --> 00:37:10.865
God nurture believers.

720
00:37:12.715 --> 00:37:14.725
This is what Ephesians four says about that.

721
00:37:14.725 --> 00:37:17.685
About how church leaders we are to equip the saints

722
00:37:17.845 --> 00:37:20.605
for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ

723
00:37:21.015 --> 00:37:22.885
until we all attain to the unity of the faith

724
00:37:22.905 --> 00:37:24.165
and the knowledge of the Son of God.

725
00:37:24.305 --> 00:37:26.885
To mature manhood to the measure,

726
00:37:26.945 --> 00:37:28.285
the stature of the fullness of Christ.

727
00:37:28.745 --> 00:37:31.645
So that we may no longer be children. There's growth, right?

728
00:37:31.865 --> 00:37:33.205
Tossed to and fro by the waves

729
00:37:33.205 --> 00:37:36.085
and carried about by every wind of doctrine, human cunning,

730
00:37:36.215 --> 00:37:38.045
craftiness and deceitful schemes.

731
00:37:38.625 --> 00:37:40.405
Rather speaking the truth in love.

732
00:37:40.405 --> 00:37:43.085
We are to grow up in every way into him.

733
00:37:43.085 --> 00:37:45.445
Who is the head into Christ? From whom?

734
00:37:45.445 --> 00:37:47.085
The whole body joined

735
00:37:47.085 --> 00:37:49.565
and held together by every joint with which it is equipped.

736
00:37:49.715 --> 00:37:53.805
When each part is working properly, makes the body grow so

737
00:37:53.805 --> 00:37:55.605
that it builds itself up in love.

738
00:37:57.135 --> 00:37:59.315
Listen, I'm not finished growing yet.

739
00:38:01.185 --> 00:38:02.805
You're not finished growing yet.

740
00:38:04.685 --> 00:38:09.485
None of us look like Christ yet as we one day will.

741
00:38:11.225 --> 00:38:13.885
But until that day comes, God uses the church

742
00:38:14.305 --> 00:38:15.445
to help us get there.

743
00:38:18.035 --> 00:38:19.905
Lemme just think about this as believers.

744
00:38:20.095 --> 00:38:22.025
What brothers and sisters hold me accountable.

745
00:38:22.025 --> 00:38:24.745
That helps me grow. Somebody teaching

746
00:38:24.745 --> 00:38:25.825
you how to obey God's word.

747
00:38:25.825 --> 00:38:27.465
Helping you grow sin.

748
00:38:27.465 --> 00:38:30.465
When it's repented of shown grace to, it grows

749
00:38:30.685 --> 00:38:32.625
as we serve one another with the gifts we've been given.

750
00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:36.445
We grow as we give financially to care for each other.

751
00:38:36.745 --> 00:38:40.805
We grow as we encourage, as we equip, we're helping grow

752
00:38:40.905 --> 00:38:43.285
as we do all of that,

753
00:38:43.635 --> 00:38:45.925
what we're doing is we're helping each other conform

754
00:38:46.065 --> 00:38:49.445
to the image of God's son to Christ.

755
00:38:49.445 --> 00:38:53.425
Like this. Nearly all

756
00:38:53.445 --> 00:38:56.305
of the New Testament letters were written to churches

757
00:38:56.645 --> 00:38:59.145
and their primary concern was

758
00:38:59.145 --> 00:39:00.345
how those believers were growing.

759
00:39:01.725 --> 00:39:03.065
Paul's like, man, how, how's it going?

760
00:39:03.295 --> 00:39:05.025
Tell me, here's what I hope happens for you.

761
00:39:05.045 --> 00:39:07.145
Here's the growth I want in you. Those kind of things.

762
00:39:10.825 --> 00:39:15.125
And in that, there is no category in God's word

763
00:39:15.505 --> 00:39:19.005
for someone to sit in a church year after year after year

764
00:39:19.105 --> 00:39:20.765
and never grow in their faith.

765
00:39:21.215 --> 00:39:25.545
Never grow in obedience to Christ. You just can't find it.

766
00:39:26.015 --> 00:39:28.625
It's not there. That just does not happen.

767
00:39:28.685 --> 00:39:29.985
If the Lord is truly working

768
00:39:30.045 --> 00:39:31.225
in someone's life, it doesn't happen.

769
00:39:31.525 --> 00:39:34.305
Now, I'm not saying it's gonna be a perfectly upward slope

770
00:39:34.565 --> 00:39:35.785
of your growth path

771
00:39:37.065 --> 00:39:40.545
'cause mine's not mine looks more like this, right?

772
00:39:40.615 --> 00:39:42.145
Kind of just doing this all.

773
00:39:43.485 --> 00:39:45.065
But the the general trend

774
00:39:46.515 --> 00:39:49.075
over time is christlikeness.

775
00:39:49.245 --> 00:39:51.035
Eventually one day he's gonna complete the work.

776
00:39:51.035 --> 00:39:54.595
He began in me. And you know what he did to get me there?

777
00:39:54.735 --> 00:39:58.275
He used the church. He uses the church.

778
00:39:58.615 --> 00:40:02.275
People within the church structure to get me down the road.

779
00:40:02.415 --> 00:40:03.595
I'm not where I need to be yet,

780
00:40:03.595 --> 00:40:05.155
but praise God, I'm not where I was.

781
00:40:06.685 --> 00:40:09.665
And the church is what God uses towards that end.

782
00:40:09.665 --> 00:40:13.935
And so we are to nurture believers, help each other grow.

783
00:40:13.995 --> 00:40:16.095
Here's the third one. We are to live sent

784
00:40:17.795 --> 00:40:20.805
worship God nurture believers live sent,

785
00:40:21.525 --> 00:40:22.815
hear this all the time around here.

786
00:40:22.815 --> 00:40:24.935
Christ's final words to his disciples

787
00:40:25.315 --> 00:40:27.935
and by extension to us were to go make disciples

788
00:40:27.935 --> 00:40:31.855
of all nations to be witnesses locally and globally.

789
00:40:31.855 --> 00:40:33.415
That's what he left with them.

790
00:40:33.475 --> 00:40:36.895
And then the entire book of Acts, Christ ascended to heaven.

791
00:40:37.195 --> 00:40:39.135
The Spirit descended on the church.

792
00:40:39.355 --> 00:40:41.255
The entire book of Acts is the story

793
00:40:41.255 --> 00:40:43.135
of God's mission expanding

794
00:40:43.205 --> 00:40:45.255
through his people, through the church.

795
00:40:47.015 --> 00:40:49.115
Why do we somehow think that we're not included in that?

796
00:40:51.105 --> 00:40:52.645
That's what he does through the church,

797
00:40:52.705 --> 00:40:54.525
is he sends his people and listen.

798
00:40:54.835 --> 00:40:57.445
Some people try to pit those three tasks against each other.

799
00:40:58.895 --> 00:40:59.945
Like we gotta pick one

800
00:40:59.945 --> 00:41:01.945
or the other at the expense of those others.

801
00:41:02.285 --> 00:41:04.265
No, we can be about all three

802
00:41:04.265 --> 00:41:05.905
of those at the same time, can't we?

803
00:41:09.475 --> 00:41:10.885
It's a both end. It's not an either or.

804
00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:13.925
We can worship God as we worship God.

805
00:41:13.925 --> 00:41:16.125
People are drawn to something bigger than ourselves.

806
00:41:17.315 --> 00:41:18.965
They walk in God's truly among you.

807
00:41:18.965 --> 00:41:20.005
Something's happening here.

808
00:41:21.985 --> 00:41:25.085
As we grow in our faith, we see we wanna worship more.

809
00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:28.205
We wanna go more because we see the importance of it

810
00:41:30.185 --> 00:41:32.485
as we go and follow our shepherd into the world,

811
00:41:32.625 --> 00:41:34.565
it stretches us, it nurtures us,

812
00:41:34.585 --> 00:41:36.645
and it creates dependence on God.

813
00:41:36.765 --> 00:41:40.885
'cause we can't do it ourselves. And you think,

814
00:41:41.355 --> 00:41:44.885
just think about the times you've seen God work in your life

815
00:41:44.885 --> 00:41:47.045
and other people's lives around the baptism stories we've

816
00:41:47.045 --> 00:41:50.405
heard and we see lives transformed.

817
00:41:50.705 --> 00:41:54.725
We see marriages healed. We see people freed from addiction.

818
00:41:54.915 --> 00:41:59.565
Does that not spur worship as we see God work

819
00:41:59.565 --> 00:42:03.845
through us going, it all ties together.

820
00:42:06.125 --> 00:42:10.415
See friends, this is the church. This is the church.

821
00:42:10.635 --> 00:42:13.415
An imperfect, messy group of people

822
00:42:15.675 --> 00:42:19.535
who are trusting in a perfect and secure God.

823
00:42:22.885 --> 00:42:26.655
What glory he gets when he uses people like us. When.
