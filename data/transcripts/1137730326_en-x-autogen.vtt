1
00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:17.065
Good morning, church.

2
00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:18.825
Good morning. It's great to see you.

3
00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:21.145
If you're new to our church, we are glad you're here.

4
00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:23.825
We'd love to welcome you a little more directly if you'd let

5
00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:26.185
us, if you've been here for ages, for decades,

6
00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:27.745
uh, we love you as well.

7
00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:29.785
We're glad you're here. Uh, by the way,

8
00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:33.265
if you are a member here, please remember to, uh, vote

9
00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:34.545
for the deacon candidates this year.

10
00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:37.305
We've got that over, uh, the next hour.

11
00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:41.385
Got time for that online or at the info desk in the lobby.

12
00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:46.825
Now we have journeyed for many months through First Samuel

13
00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:49.985
and then the last few months through Second Samuel.

14
00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:53.865
And we've been tracing God's provision

15
00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:55.865
of a king for his people.

16
00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:58.065
And, and not only seeing that how

17
00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:00.545
that has shown up in Israel's history,

18
00:01:00.565 --> 00:01:03.345
but also how that points us to the true king.

19
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.185
Uh, that's the main point of these passages

20
00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:09.385
yet we've also seen along with that, is the mess

21
00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:11.305
that sin can create.

22
00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:16.985
It has been really hard to watch King David's sin

23
00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:20.505
and then the family fallout, the national fallout

24
00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:22.985
that we've seen in Israel as we've walked through.

25
00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:24.905
Second Samuel, especially, it's been

26
00:01:25.665 --> 00:01:27.305
seemingly train wreck after train wreck.

27
00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:29.825
Painful to watch. Well, today,

28
00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:32.225
before we get to the end of the series, next week,

29
00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.265
by the way, if you're dressing up, that's next week.

30
00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:35.465
But as we get to that,

31
00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:38.145
today feels like a breath of fresh air.

32
00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.745
There's a le a measure of like freedom.

33
00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:42.025
Today we see this

34
00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:46.025
because as you turn to Second Samuel chapter 22, today,

35
00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:49.785
what we find is essentially one of David's psalms.

36
00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:55.365
It's a song, uh, that David wrote.

37
00:01:57.405 --> 00:01:59.745
Now, by the way, if we're not gonna cover this at the end

38
00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:02.505
of chapter 23, there's a record of David's mighty men,

39
00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:06.145
like his 30 or so really elite warriors.

40
00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:08.105
And so if you're into military and battles

41
00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:10.185
and those kind of things, go read that later this afternoon.

42
00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:12.385
It is awesome, like just story

43
00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:14.345
after story of fighting lions and stuff.

44
00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:17.705
It's pretty cool. But that's, that's what that is.

45
00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:18.945
But chapter 22,

46
00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:21.345
and even into chapter 23,

47
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.865
it's really just David praising the Lord for who God is, for

48
00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:27.945
what he's done, for what he believes da God

49
00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:29.065
will do in the future.

50
00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:30.985
And it's just a beautiful picture

51
00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.745
of praise in response to God.

52
00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:38.785
In fact, it's repeated in Psalm 18, nearly word for word.

53
00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:43.735
It's what David wrote as a song when God delivered him,

54
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:48.335
and it became a national hymn in Psalm 18 later.

55
00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:51.285
And so it's a song David wrote when God delivered Him.

56
00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:55.485
But it's also, I believe a song that each one of us needs

57
00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:59.325
to hear and can identify with and relate to.

58
00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:03.605
And we can praise God with David as we read it

59
00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:06.555
because here's the reality.

60
00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:09.915
Some of you are in the middle of a storm right now

61
00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:13.755
and you're facing this need for deliverance or,

62
00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:14.955
or maybe you're heading into a storm

63
00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:16.635
and you can see it coming on the horizon

64
00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:18.235
or you're out of a storm

65
00:03:18.235 --> 00:03:21.675
and you're looking back reflecting on what God did through

66
00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:24.955
that God's word today will give us language

67
00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:29.555
with which we can praise God in the middle of

68
00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:31.835
a storm that we face.

69
00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:36.825
So here's what I wanna do. I wanna read the whole thing.

70
00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:42.345
That means 51 verses chapter 22 is 51 verses long and

71
00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:44.225
and I just, I wanna do that

72
00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:45.945
because this is a song

73
00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:49.705
just like we don't really break up songs, we verse chorus,

74
00:03:49.735 --> 00:03:51.945
that kind of stuff, but we don't stop after the verse.

75
00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.905
We do the whole thing, let it speak.

76
00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:55.305
And so that's what this is.

77
00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:58.345
Let God's word speak as it was intended.

78
00:03:58.445 --> 00:03:59.865
So read the whole thing, then come back

79
00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:02.345
and we'll give three quick truths to hang on

80
00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:04.705
to about God in response, but,

81
00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:06.465
but we're just gonna read the whole thing.

82
00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:09.705
And so what I hope as we kind of kind of gear up for,

83
00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:12.665
it's gonna take a couple minutes, but what I hope we can do

84
00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:15.505
as you're listening or reading it in front of you,

85
00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:18.225
just worship with this

86
00:04:19.245 --> 00:04:22.965
like just let this spark your heart to worship.

87
00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:25.345
Second Samuel 22,

88
00:04:26.915 --> 00:04:28.975
and David spoke to the Lord the words

89
00:04:28.995 --> 00:04:31.175
of this song on the day when the Lord delivered him from the

90
00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:33.815
hand of all his enemies from the hand of Saul,

91
00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:38.615
and he said, the Lord is my rock and my fortress

92
00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:42.415
and my deliverer, my God, my rock in whom I take refuge,

93
00:04:43.195 --> 00:04:46.895
my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold,

94
00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:50.775
my refuge, my savior, you save me from violence.

95
00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:55.015
I call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised

96
00:04:55.635 --> 00:04:57.095
and I'm saved from my enemies.

97
00:04:57.955 --> 00:04:59.695
For the waves of death encompassed me.

98
00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:01.735
The torrance of destruction assailed me.

99
00:05:02.275 --> 00:05:04.055
The cords of sheel entangled me.

100
00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:07.535
The snares of death confronted me in my distress.

101
00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:09.655
I called upon the Lord to my God.

102
00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:12.295
I called and from his temple, he heard my voice

103
00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:14.335
and my cry came to his ears.

104
00:05:15.925 --> 00:05:17.535
Then the earth reeled

105
00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:19.775
and rocked the foundations of the heavens, trembled

106
00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:21.255
and quaked because he was angry.

107
00:05:21.985 --> 00:05:23.535
Smoke went up from his nostrils,

108
00:05:23.535 --> 00:05:26.015
devouring fire from his mouth, glowing coals,

109
00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:27.295
flamed forth from him.

110
00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:30.815
He bowed the heavens and came down.

111
00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:33.695
Thick darkness was under his feet.

112
00:05:33.715 --> 00:05:35.295
He rode on a cherub and flew.

113
00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:36.855
He was seen on the wings of the wind.

114
00:05:37.235 --> 00:05:40.095
He made darkness around him, his canopy, thick clouds,

115
00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:42.895
a gathering of water outta the brightness

116
00:05:42.895 --> 00:05:44.695
before him, coals of fire flamed forth.

117
00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:47.535
The Lord thundered from heaven

118
00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:52.465
and the most high uttered his voice and he sent out arrows

119
00:05:52.465 --> 00:05:54.585
and scattered them lightning and routed them.

120
00:05:55.175 --> 00:05:57.525
Then the channels of the sea were seeing the foundations

121
00:05:57.525 --> 00:06:00.205
of the world were laid bare at the rebuke of the Lord.

122
00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:02.645
At the blast of the breath of his nostrils,

123
00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:04.885
he sent from on high.

124
00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:08.685
He took me. He drew me out of many waters.

125
00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:12.405
He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me,

126
00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.685
for they were too mighty for me.

127
00:06:14.715 --> 00:06:17.085
They confronted me in the day of my calamity,

128
00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:19.605
but the Lord was my support.

129
00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:23.075
He brought me out into a broad place.

130
00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:25.675
He rescued me because he delighted in me.

131
00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:30.205
The Lord dealt with me according to my righteousness,

132
00:06:30.205 --> 00:06:32.605
according to the cleanness of my hands, he rewarded me

133
00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:35.005
for I've kept the ways of the Lord,

134
00:06:35.355 --> 00:06:37.525
have not wickedly departed from my God

135
00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:39.445
for all his rules were before me

136
00:06:39.445 --> 00:06:41.605
and from his statutes I did not turn aside.

137
00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:45.445
I was blameless before him and I kept myself from guilt

138
00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:49.485
and the Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,

139
00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:51.885
according to my cleanness, in his sight.

140
00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:55.925
With the merciful, you show yourself merciful.

141
00:06:56.275 --> 00:06:57.325
With the blameless man.

142
00:06:57.325 --> 00:06:59.845
You show yourself blameless with the purified.

143
00:06:59.865 --> 00:07:02.085
You deal purely and with the crooked.

144
00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:04.245
You make yourself seem torturous.

145
00:07:05.705 --> 00:07:07.125
You save a humble people,

146
00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:10.125
but your eyes are on the haughty, the prideful

147
00:07:10.185 --> 00:07:15.085
to bring them down for you are my lamp, oh Lord.

148
00:07:15.665 --> 00:07:19.765
And my God lightens my darkness for by you.

149
00:07:19.845 --> 00:07:21.045
I can run against a troop

150
00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:23.205
and by my God, I can leap over a wall.

151
00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:25.925
This God, his way is perfect.

152
00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:28.125
The word of the Lord proves true.

153
00:07:28.465 --> 00:07:33.105
He is a shield for all those who take refuge in him for

154
00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:37.185
who is God but the Lord and who is a rock except our God.

155
00:07:38.215 --> 00:07:42.025
This God is my strong refuge and has made my way blameless.

156
00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:44.985
He made my feet like the feet of a deer

157
00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:46.665
and set me secure on the heights.

158
00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:49.525
He trains my hands for war so

159
00:07:49.525 --> 00:07:51.285
that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.

160
00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:54.085
You've given me the shield of your salvation

161
00:07:54.345 --> 00:07:56.525
and your gentleness made me great.

162
00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:00.685
You gave a wide place for my steps under me

163
00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:02.165
and my feet did not slip.

164
00:08:03.405 --> 00:08:04.965
I pursued my enemies and destroyed them

165
00:08:04.965 --> 00:08:06.645
and did not turn back until they were consumed.

166
00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:09.925
I consumed them. I thrust them through so they did not rise.

167
00:08:10.955 --> 00:08:15.665
They fell under my feet for you equipped me with strength

168
00:08:15.885 --> 00:08:18.025
for the battle you made.

169
00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:20.225
Those who rise against me sink under me.

170
00:08:20.325 --> 00:08:22.265
You made my enemies turn their backs to me, those

171
00:08:22.265 --> 00:08:23.945
who hated me and I destroyed them.

172
00:08:24.535 --> 00:08:25.905
They looked, but there was none to save.

173
00:08:26.135 --> 00:08:28.585
They cried to the Lord, but he did not answer them.

174
00:08:30.115 --> 00:08:31.795
I beat them fine as the dust of the earth.

175
00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:33.795
I crushed them, stamped them down like

176
00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:34.915
the mire of the streets.

177
00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:38.635
You delivered me from strife with my people.

178
00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:40.035
You kept me as the head

179
00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:43.075
of the nations people whom I had not known served me.

180
00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:45.035
Foreigners came cringing to me.

181
00:08:45.215 --> 00:08:47.315
As soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me.

182
00:08:48.275 --> 00:08:51.705
Foreigners lost heart came trembling outta their fortresses.

183
00:08:53.215 --> 00:08:55.765
The Lord lives and blessed be my rock

184
00:08:55.945 --> 00:08:59.005
and exalted be my God, the rock of my salvation.

185
00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:01.085
The God who gave me vengeance

186
00:09:01.085 --> 00:09:02.925
and brought down peoples under me,

187
00:09:03.065 --> 00:09:04.845
who brought me out from my enemies.

188
00:09:05.185 --> 00:09:07.845
You exalted me above those who rose against me.

189
00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:12.565
You delivered me from men of violence for this.

190
00:09:13.205 --> 00:09:15.845
I will praise you, oh Lord, among the nations

191
00:09:16.345 --> 00:09:17.965
and sing praises to your name.

192
00:09:18.935 --> 00:09:21.125
Great salvation he brings to his king

193
00:09:21.385 --> 00:09:24.725
and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David

194
00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:26.525
and his offspring forever.

195
00:09:28.555 --> 00:09:29.585
Isn't that amazing?

196
00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:34.025
Like just amazing truths.

197
00:09:34.045 --> 00:09:35.825
In fact, here's what I want us to do with, with

198
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.825
that in your mind now, like you've just heard that

199
00:09:37.825 --> 00:09:39.545
and maybe it's sitting in front of you on your Bible

200
00:09:39.685 --> 00:09:43.145
or open on your device, like let's just respond just like

201
00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:45.545
David in, in, out loud praise

202
00:09:45.925 --> 00:09:48.025
to the Lord all at the same time.

203
00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:49.465
We've done this a few times over the years, right?

204
00:09:49.535 --> 00:09:52.425
Like everybody praying out loud in response in

205
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.585
praise to God.

206
00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:56.225
Now don't worry, God's a big God. He can sort it out.

207
00:09:56.245 --> 00:09:58.305
You're talking, but they're talking too. That's okay.

208
00:09:58.445 --> 00:10:01.225
You can all talk at the same time. God can understand it.

209
00:10:02.175 --> 00:10:03.465
Just give him praise, right?

210
00:10:03.475 --> 00:10:06.825
Let's let this be the words to who God is.

211
00:10:06.975 --> 00:10:08.985
Tell him who he is. Remind him of that.

212
00:10:09.285 --> 00:10:11.345
Be praising God all out loud.

213
00:10:11.525 --> 00:10:12.905
Let this prompt your words

214
00:10:14.005 --> 00:10:16.185
and let's just practice praising God together.

215
00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:20.425
Okay? Let's go everybody out loud together. Just praise him.

216
00:11:04.885 --> 00:11:07.535
Lord, thank you for who you are,

217
00:11:08.885 --> 00:11:13.535
that your word gives us words, gives us language

218
00:11:13.565 --> 00:11:18.245
with which to praise you, that we can use the very words

219
00:11:18.265 --> 00:11:20.925
of David, your words through David to

220
00:11:21.705 --> 00:11:25.365
praise you just like He did to remind you of who you are.

221
00:11:25.385 --> 00:11:28.685
You didn't forget, but we forget.

222
00:11:30.885 --> 00:11:32.865
So Lord, may we live with that kind

223
00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:37.805
of praise on our lips every day for your glory,

224
00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:41.085
for our good, but mostly for your glory

225
00:11:41.825 --> 00:11:42.885
in Jesus' name.

226
00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:46.565
Amen. That's pretty cool, right?

227
00:11:46.565 --> 00:11:48.605
You've maybe never prayed out loud before.

228
00:11:48.605 --> 00:11:51.645
Well, now you have. And so just keep going, keep going,

229
00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:55.245
pray out loud where you are with others as well.

230
00:11:56.455 --> 00:11:58.475
Now we're gonna come back and actually sing some

231
00:11:58.475 --> 00:12:01.315
of those words from two Samuel 22 later.

232
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.275
But I did say three truths you can hang on to.

233
00:12:04.275 --> 00:12:07.975
Here's the first one. God delivers his people

234
00:12:09.585 --> 00:12:12.415
first truth, God delivers his people.

235
00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:17.135
The context of this song, remember is

236
00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:18.775
that it's pointing to God's deliverance.

237
00:12:18.925 --> 00:12:23.055
Saul was chasing after David and even after Saul died.

238
00:12:23.435 --> 00:12:25.895
It was his family, it was household,

239
00:12:25.955 --> 00:12:28.455
it was other allies of Saul.

240
00:12:28.455 --> 00:12:29.815
They were still coming after David.

241
00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:32.295
And so David wasn't even free after Saul died.

242
00:12:32.295 --> 00:12:35.175
There were other enemy armies around Philistines, others

243
00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:37.015
pressing in on Israel.

244
00:12:37.075 --> 00:12:40.455
And so David's in this place of needing deliverance,

245
00:12:40.475 --> 00:12:42.335
but the Lord delivered David.

246
00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:46.095
All of this, the whole thing points to God's deliverance

247
00:12:46.095 --> 00:12:48.255
of David in very real ways.

248
00:12:48.255 --> 00:12:53.005
Victory given through all kinds of different means.

249
00:12:54.175 --> 00:12:56.395
That's why you saw David say things like verse two,

250
00:12:56.655 --> 00:13:00.595
the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer.

251
00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:05.315
Verse three, my God, my rock in whom I take refuge.

252
00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.795
That's you need something protection.

253
00:13:07.795 --> 00:13:10.355
He's the one verse three, my savior,

254
00:13:10.535 --> 00:13:12.355
you save me from violence.

255
00:13:13.805 --> 00:13:17.035
Verse four, he said, I call upon the Lord who is worthy

256
00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:20.315
to be praised and I am saved from my

257
00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:22.745
enemies deliverance.

258
00:13:24.005 --> 00:13:25.025
You even saw the power

259
00:13:25.045 --> 00:13:26.745
of God coming through on behalf of David.

260
00:13:26.775 --> 00:13:30.825
Like verse 10, he bowed the heavens and came down.

261
00:13:31.965 --> 00:13:34.015
What did he come down as? He came down as God,

262
00:13:34.515 --> 00:13:35.855
the deliverer for David.

263
00:13:37.365 --> 00:13:40.175
There's language of rescue all throughout the passage.

264
00:13:40.265 --> 00:13:42.255
Verse 31, he's a shield.

265
00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.375
It means you hide behind him for those

266
00:13:46.515 --> 00:13:47.815
who take refuge in him.

267
00:13:47.825 --> 00:13:52.375
Verse 44, you delivered me from strife with my people.

268
00:13:54.175 --> 00:13:57.365
Verse 49, he says, God brought him out, brought him outta

269
00:13:57.365 --> 00:13:59.445
what brought him outta the mess that he was in

270
00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:01.685
and the enemies that were surrounding him brought him out

271
00:14:01.685 --> 00:14:03.365
to a safe place.

272
00:14:03.465 --> 00:14:07.965
The whole chapter filled with deliverance language,

273
00:14:10.155 --> 00:14:11.785
which is why David ended with this.

274
00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.705
Remember verse 50, he said this

275
00:14:15.915 --> 00:14:17.455
for this, what's this?

276
00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:19.895
The deliverance for this.

277
00:14:20.495 --> 00:14:22.775
I will praise you, oh Lord, among the nations

278
00:14:22.955 --> 00:14:26.095
and sing praises to your name.

279
00:14:26.405 --> 00:14:28.655
Deliverance led to praise.

280
00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:32.795
Salvation led to worship.

281
00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:38.635
But let's not forget this was not just any old run

282
00:14:38.635 --> 00:14:39.715
of the mill deliverance.

283
00:14:40.265 --> 00:14:44.275
Like it wasn't like David got an F on a grade on a test one

284
00:14:44.275 --> 00:14:46.235
time and somehow still passed the class

285
00:14:46.315 --> 00:14:49.595
because his professor was full of grace, right?

286
00:14:49.595 --> 00:14:53.085
Like, man, God delivered me. Yeah, okay. Somewhat.

287
00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:56.945
But Remember like this was deliverance

288
00:14:57.885 --> 00:15:01.505
and David was in desperate need of deliverance.

289
00:15:01.575 --> 00:15:03.985
Like this was through desperation.

290
00:15:05.755 --> 00:15:06.835
I guess if you got an F on a final,

291
00:15:06.835 --> 00:15:08.955
you might feel desperate, but this is like real desperation,

292
00:15:11.665 --> 00:15:13.925
the desperate storms he was facing.

293
00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.965
'cause remember this, David was facing

294
00:15:17.765 --> 00:15:20.405
seemingly insurmountable armies coming at him.

295
00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:25.205
The king was trying to exterminate him.

296
00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:31.005
He was facing rebellion from within his own family

297
00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:34.165
who were trying to take the throne away from him.

298
00:15:34.335 --> 00:15:38.605
David was facing desperation in its pure form.

299
00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:42.685
That's why he says in verse five, for the waves of death

300
00:15:43.315 --> 00:15:48.105
encompassed me, the Torrance of destruction assailed me.

301
00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:52.825
He was feeling as if he was dying, yet he was still alive.

302
00:15:55.815 --> 00:15:57.405
David also wrote Psalm 23,

303
00:15:57.465 --> 00:16:01.045
and it says in there, even though I walk through the valley

304
00:16:01.185 --> 00:16:04.245
of the shadow of death, that's what he's feeling right now.

305
00:16:06.395 --> 00:16:10.135
The Torrance of destruction, that waves of death.

306
00:16:10.195 --> 00:16:14.455
And then verse seven, in my distress,

307
00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:16.175
I called upon the Lord.

308
00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:21.065
To my God, I called. He's in a bad spot.

309
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:26.475
But did you notice what God did in response?

310
00:16:28.775 --> 00:16:32.115
The next verse is talk about how when David cries out

311
00:16:34.185 --> 00:16:38.605
Or the earth shakes the heavens trembled, it talks about

312
00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:41.965
how this God, he's praying to came down.

313
00:16:44.245 --> 00:16:48.925
All because one man cried out in faith, God,

314
00:16:49.005 --> 00:16:50.925
I need you, God, I need you.

315
00:16:50.985 --> 00:16:52.565
And he said, I'm here.

316
00:16:53.665 --> 00:16:56.565
And look at the power he brought with them.

317
00:16:56.565 --> 00:16:59.845
Listen, God is not some deity out there somewhere

318
00:17:00.105 --> 00:17:02.685
who is unmoved by his people's distress.

319
00:17:04.295 --> 00:17:05.705
He's not just out there kinda like,

320
00:17:05.705 --> 00:17:06.745
well, hope it all works out.

321
00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:11.585
No, he is actually the warrior king who rides in

322
00:17:11.845 --> 00:17:15.625
to rescue his beloved like way better than any

323
00:17:15.625 --> 00:17:17.065
of those Hallmark movies that you'll watch

324
00:17:17.095 --> 00:17:18.345
here in the next month, right?

325
00:17:18.415 --> 00:17:20.145
Like this rescuer comes

326
00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.385
to save her from the the country, right?

327
00:17:22.725 --> 00:17:27.545
No, it's like this is true rescue. This is true desperation.

328
00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:30.745
This is true rescue where he's the warrior king.

329
00:17:31.195 --> 00:17:32.385
Don't think that just

330
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.025
because you're going through a trial right now,

331
00:17:34.135 --> 00:17:35.705
that somehow God is absent.

332
00:17:37.925 --> 00:17:40.505
Now we know from Second Samuel you might be suffering

333
00:17:40.505 --> 00:17:43.985
because of your sin and you might not get

334
00:17:43.985 --> 00:17:45.145
outta that consequence.

335
00:17:47.695 --> 00:17:52.565
But our trials are also the occasions

336
00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:55.445
for God's spectacular intervention.

337
00:17:56.915 --> 00:17:57.965
When you're facing something

338
00:17:57.965 --> 00:17:59.525
that you don't feel like you can ever get out of,

339
00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:00.805
you feel like there's no hope,

340
00:18:01.345 --> 00:18:03.925
his intervention is often spectacular.

341
00:18:04.095 --> 00:18:06.605
Think back the very beginning

342
00:18:06.605 --> 00:18:08.525
of this entire series in one Samuel

343
00:18:09.875 --> 00:18:12.695
Hannah prayed in one Samuel chapter two,

344
00:18:14.865 --> 00:18:17.845
She prayed a desperate prayer because she was barren.

345
00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:20.875
She could not have children, and she was desperate

346
00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:22.355
and she'd been praying for years

347
00:18:22.455 --> 00:18:23.635
and for years and for years.

348
00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.835
And God finally answered that prayer with Samuel

349
00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:30.795
and her prayer in response in First Samuel chapter two is

350
00:18:30.795 --> 00:18:32.195
nearly identical to

351
00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:35.235
what David prays right here about God being our rock,

352
00:18:35.575 --> 00:18:36.915
God being our deliverer.

353
00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.715
And God's not only gonna deliver us today,

354
00:18:38.745 --> 00:18:39.755
he's gonna deliver forever.

355
00:18:40.135 --> 00:18:42.435
That's her prayer. That's David's prayer.

356
00:18:42.585 --> 00:18:45.195
What was the kicker in both of them? Desperation.

357
00:18:46.785 --> 00:18:48.875
They were desperate. God answered.

358
00:18:49.015 --> 00:18:52.915
God came through and they praised in response.

359
00:18:55.665 --> 00:18:59.685
Here's the question. Do you see your desperate circumstances

360
00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:02.685
as opportunities to witness God's delivering power?

361
00:19:04.245 --> 00:19:05.775
Like is that how you view 'em?

362
00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:09.215
You're in a crisis, you're in a tough spot

363
00:19:09.275 --> 00:19:13.295
and you see this is an opportunity for God to show up.

364
00:19:13.355 --> 00:19:14.375
Is that how you see it?

365
00:19:14.475 --> 00:19:17.775
Or do you think this one's too big for God?

366
00:19:21.005 --> 00:19:25.185
This one's too much. Like do you believe? Is that in there?

367
00:19:25.245 --> 00:19:27.465
Is that, is that maybe in the back of your mind like, ah,

368
00:19:27.465 --> 00:19:28.985
I don't know if God can handle this one?

369
00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:31.945
Is that, is that where your heart is?

370
00:19:34.105 --> 00:19:36.845
Or maybe you've just become satisfied

371
00:19:36.945 --> 00:19:38.645
and comfortable in your own

372
00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:41.445
self-sufficiency to handle the problem.

373
00:19:43.045 --> 00:19:45.345
Crisis comes. Difficulty shows up.

374
00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:48.905
I got this, I got this.

375
00:19:49.025 --> 00:19:51.185
I just gotta man up and take care of it. I can handle this.

376
00:19:51.805 --> 00:19:52.665
Is that where you are?

377
00:19:57.715 --> 00:19:59.855
You've heard the phrase, God

378
00:19:59.855 --> 00:20:01.095
helps those who help themselves.

379
00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:03.775
That's not in here. Just

380
00:20:03.775 --> 00:20:07.735
so you know, it's not true.

381
00:20:09.305 --> 00:20:11.515
It's not that God helps those who help themselves. No.

382
00:20:11.775 --> 00:20:14.195
God saves those who know they need to be saved.

383
00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:17.995
God delivers those who know they need to be delivered.

384
00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:21.795
God reaches in just like David in his desperation.

385
00:20:22.175 --> 00:20:24.635
God reaches in and says, I'm going to save you

386
00:20:25.825 --> 00:20:27.715
because you know you need me.

387
00:20:27.715 --> 00:20:29.635
That's the way God designed us to

388
00:20:29.635 --> 00:20:30.635
Work.

389
00:20:31.745 --> 00:20:33.495
We're not meant to be self-sufficient.

390
00:20:33.495 --> 00:20:34.535
We're meant to need him,

391
00:20:34.675 --> 00:20:36.295
and that's the best place for us to be.

392
00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:42.645
God delivers his people even through our desperation.

393
00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:48.615
Here's the second truth. It's

394
00:20:48.615 --> 00:20:49.815
that God rewards the

395
00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:53.985
righteous God rewards.

396
00:20:54.085 --> 00:20:57.185
We saw this in Second Samuel 22. God rewards the righteous.

397
00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:02.025
And we not only see it here in this chapter,

398
00:21:02.085 --> 00:21:03.945
we see it throughout first and second Samuel.

399
00:21:03.945 --> 00:21:05.865
Various ways We see that when we follow,

400
00:21:06.055 --> 00:21:07.825
when a person follows God's will,

401
00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:11.105
when they obey God's plan, life works better.

402
00:21:12.935 --> 00:21:14.465
Like life works better it.

403
00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:17.355
It may not be perfect because

404
00:21:17.355 --> 00:21:18.555
we still live in a fallen world.

405
00:21:18.555 --> 00:21:20.515
We still have broken bodies. Life won't be perfect,

406
00:21:20.855 --> 00:21:23.355
but life will certainly go better when we live according

407
00:21:23.355 --> 00:21:25.475
to the way God designed it to live.

408
00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:28.635
When you submit your plans to God

409
00:21:28.635 --> 00:21:29.675
and follow his plan,

410
00:21:29.675 --> 00:21:33.235
instead you are then not only following a, a better path

411
00:21:33.235 --> 00:21:36.515
for life, you're also under the covering of God's blessing.

412
00:21:36.535 --> 00:21:39.155
You're under the cover of His fullness

413
00:21:39.385 --> 00:21:40.395
that you're receiving.

414
00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:43.465
That's what David was referring to here,

415
00:21:43.615 --> 00:21:45.785
chapter 22, verse 21.

416
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:49.225
He said it this way, the Lord dealt with me according

417
00:21:49.285 --> 00:21:52.865
to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands.

418
00:21:53.405 --> 00:21:58.035
He rewarded me. He kept God's ways.

419
00:21:58.135 --> 00:22:00.435
He didn't follow through with the wicked ways.

420
00:22:00.535 --> 00:22:02.395
He was innocent, he was blameless.

421
00:22:02.455 --> 00:22:05.795
He says in verse 25, follows with this in response,

422
00:22:06.055 --> 00:22:09.675
the Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,

423
00:22:09.675 --> 00:22:13.235
according to my cleanness in his sights.

424
00:22:15.745 --> 00:22:17.365
Here's the problem with all that though.

425
00:22:18.905 --> 00:22:21.445
We having walked this long month journey,

426
00:22:24.035 --> 00:22:26.615
we know we're not reading this in isolation.

427
00:22:26.835 --> 00:22:29.995
Are we? Like if we just read that

428
00:22:29.995 --> 00:22:31.475
and David's like, man, this guy's great.

429
00:22:31.775 --> 00:22:33.355
He might've written this at the beginning of his life,

430
00:22:33.355 --> 00:22:34.755
earlier in life, but we know

431
00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:36.475
it's included at the end of his life.

432
00:22:36.535 --> 00:22:41.475
And so when we know on our side of this We know

433
00:22:41.475 --> 00:22:44.315
that David was not innocent,

434
00:22:46.445 --> 00:22:48.425
he was clearly not like how?

435
00:22:48.485 --> 00:22:52.435
How could the murderous adulterer say all that?

436
00:22:54.685 --> 00:22:59.145
How could he claim to be clean, to be innocent?

437
00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:00.545
How could he claim to be blameless?

438
00:23:00.805 --> 00:23:03.425
How could he claim to have followed the Lord's plan? How?

439
00:23:03.765 --> 00:23:08.425
How could he? 'cause here's

440
00:23:08.425 --> 00:23:09.505
what I believe he's speaking of.

441
00:23:10.735 --> 00:23:13.145
He's speaking of directional faithfulness.

442
00:23:17.165 --> 00:23:19.065
Was David Sinlessly perfect?

443
00:23:20.185 --> 00:23:21.245
No, Clearly not.

444
00:23:21.745 --> 00:23:23.525
That's why the point is not to follow David.

445
00:23:23.545 --> 00:23:25.845
The point is to follow the true king Jesus

446
00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:27.965
who was sinlessly perfect.

447
00:23:28.545 --> 00:23:31.765
We don't trust in man. We trust in God, But

448
00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:36.085
but notice the comparison made He, he talks about how

449
00:23:37.325 --> 00:23:39.325
I have not wickedly departed from my God.

450
00:23:39.655 --> 00:23:41.765
Think back to the whole journey we've walked through.

451
00:23:41.765 --> 00:23:44.205
First and second Samuel, have we seen kings

452
00:23:44.645 --> 00:23:45.925
wickedly depart from God?

453
00:23:47.825 --> 00:23:50.105
Saul. Saul did.

454
00:23:50.965 --> 00:23:53.625
So in a sense, there's a comparison all throughout one,

455
00:23:53.685 --> 00:23:55.905
two Samuel of the way Saul lived

456
00:23:56.165 --> 00:23:57.625
and the way David has lived.

457
00:23:57.945 --> 00:23:59.705
'cause here's the difference. Saul was

458
00:23:59.935 --> 00:24:02.225
directionally unfaithful.

459
00:24:03.165 --> 00:24:05.945
He sinned, he followed the way of the world,

460
00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:09.985
followed his own flesh, and he never turned back to God.

461
00:24:11.465 --> 00:24:14.685
He never directionally followed the Lord,

462
00:24:14.685 --> 00:24:16.005
never really wanted to.

463
00:24:16.145 --> 00:24:19.445
And in fact, his focus was on maintaining his own

464
00:24:19.745 --> 00:24:20.925
little K kingdom.

465
00:24:23.585 --> 00:24:26.305
David also sinned,

466
00:24:27.505 --> 00:24:30.805
but directionally was oriented towards the kingdom

467
00:24:30.865 --> 00:24:33.405
of God being first and foremost, not his own kingdom.

468
00:24:33.665 --> 00:24:35.605
He was not worried about maintaining his kingdom.

469
00:24:35.825 --> 00:24:39.645
He wanted God's kingdom. And that's a major difference.

470
00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:43.165
Directionally unfaithful, directionally faithful,

471
00:24:43.345 --> 00:24:47.925
not perfect, but faithful to follow,

472
00:24:48.555 --> 00:24:50.525
keep returning, keep repenting,

473
00:24:50.715 --> 00:24:53.205
keep setting up structures not to go back to the sin.

474
00:24:53.475 --> 00:24:56.165
That is what he's talking about right here.

475
00:24:56.625 --> 00:24:58.045
And listen, God will reward that.

476
00:25:00.595 --> 00:25:05.535
God will reward that kind of faithfulness again, even

477
00:25:05.885 --> 00:25:08.095
through our imperfection.

478
00:25:10.585 --> 00:25:14.405
God is a gracious God who will reward those who pursue him.

479
00:25:16.495 --> 00:25:19.865
It's very clear even in this chapter that God is going

480
00:25:19.885 --> 00:25:22.105
to discipline and even condemn

481
00:25:22.105 --> 00:25:24.665
and punish those who are walking away from him.

482
00:25:24.805 --> 00:25:26.505
But those who walk towards him, those

483
00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:28.065
who are oriented towards him,

484
00:25:28.175 --> 00:25:29.825
he's gonna reward, he's gonna bless.

485
00:25:32.065 --> 00:25:34.645
Now I know talking about reward

486
00:25:34.645 --> 00:25:36.605
and blessing makes us a little uncomfortable at times

487
00:25:37.555 --> 00:25:40.085
because that has been co-opted into thinking that man,

488
00:25:40.085 --> 00:25:41.605
when you follow God and you obey God,

489
00:25:41.605 --> 00:25:42.605
he's gonna make you healthy.

490
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:44.205
He's gonna milk you, make you wealthy,

491
00:25:44.475 --> 00:25:45.925
he's gonna give you everything you would ever want.

492
00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:47.365
That's also not in here.

493
00:25:51.545 --> 00:25:55.285
So it's not, his reward is going to be health, wealth,

494
00:25:55.315 --> 00:25:56.925
comfort, all the good things

495
00:25:56.925 --> 00:25:58.085
you could ever dream about in life.

496
00:25:58.105 --> 00:26:00.605
That's not the reward he's talking about.

497
00:26:00.945 --> 00:26:04.445
He might not even give you back everything you had

498
00:26:04.665 --> 00:26:05.685
before you sinned.

499
00:26:07.395 --> 00:26:08.725
Like that's a reality here.

500
00:26:09.705 --> 00:26:11.525
We saw it all over Second Samuel,

501
00:26:11.755 --> 00:26:13.485
there's consequences to sin.

502
00:26:13.665 --> 00:26:15.045
It doesn't mean that when you repent,

503
00:26:15.215 --> 00:26:16.565
God's gonna just make it all right

504
00:26:16.705 --> 00:26:18.885
and go right back to everything the way it was before.

505
00:26:19.025 --> 00:26:20.805
You might have to pay the consequence of

506
00:26:20.805 --> 00:26:22.165
that sin the rest of your life.

507
00:26:22.385 --> 00:26:25.405
But here's the difference, James four eight says,

508
00:26:25.715 --> 00:26:26.805
draw near to God.

509
00:26:27.105 --> 00:26:28.565
He will draw near to you.

510
00:26:31.035 --> 00:26:32.535
That's the reward.

511
00:26:34.665 --> 00:26:37.835
It's not stuff, it's not comfort. It's not a better life.

512
00:26:37.855 --> 00:26:41.995
The reward is God himself. It's his presence.

513
00:26:42.145 --> 00:26:46.565
It's his joy through whatever you're facing, sustaining you

514
00:26:46.565 --> 00:26:48.605
through whatever you're facing, the peace

515
00:26:48.605 --> 00:26:50.725
of God washing over you to walk

516
00:26:50.725 --> 00:26:51.845
through whatever you're facing.

517
00:26:52.345 --> 00:26:55.125
That's the reward he promises to give you.

518
00:26:55.215 --> 00:26:59.935
David was more concerned about God's presence rather than

519
00:26:59.935 --> 00:27:01.215
what he would get from God.

520
00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:06.195
That's what it means to be a man after God's own heart.

521
00:27:06.435 --> 00:27:08.555
Remember, that's David's like catchphrase.

522
00:27:08.555 --> 00:27:11.115
That's what people called him. A man after God's own heart.

523
00:27:11.375 --> 00:27:12.715
That's what it means.

524
00:27:12.935 --> 00:27:15.235
It doesn't mean you're never sin, it just means

525
00:27:15.235 --> 00:27:18.635
that your deepest desire is for God himself,

526
00:27:19.765 --> 00:27:22.755
above all else, above freedom, above security, above money,

527
00:27:22.845 --> 00:27:25.515
above relationships, my greatest desire,

528
00:27:25.845 --> 00:27:26.875
those are good things.

529
00:27:27.215 --> 00:27:30.115
My greatest desire is for God himself.

530
00:27:30.255 --> 00:27:35.075
And that righteousness he talks about is a blood bot covered

531
00:27:35.135 --> 00:27:39.635
by grace Covenant, keeping God kind of righteousness.

532
00:27:40.465 --> 00:27:43.075
It's a righteousness that he says himself,

533
00:27:43.575 --> 00:27:44.995
you have given to me.

534
00:27:46.675 --> 00:27:48.815
He knows he was wrong. He knows he was sinful.

535
00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:50.335
He knows he blew it in big ways,

536
00:27:50.555 --> 00:27:52.855
but he said, God, you've given me your righteousness.

537
00:27:52.995 --> 00:27:54.415
And listen, David only knew

538
00:27:54.415 --> 00:27:58.415
that in seed form the the same righteousness he's talking

539
00:27:58.415 --> 00:28:02.655
about is what we know in full today came through the life,

540
00:28:02.655 --> 00:28:05.895
death and resurrection, perfect life, substitutionary death,

541
00:28:06.025 --> 00:28:08.615
victorious resurrection of Jesus Christ in your place.

542
00:28:08.755 --> 00:28:11.255
That's the righteousness that we now know is

543
00:28:11.285 --> 00:28:12.615
what he was talking about.

544
00:28:14.155 --> 00:28:18.255
And that is an imputed righteousness that's given to you.

545
00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:20.975
It's not like you earned that. You can't do the same thing.

546
00:28:20.995 --> 00:28:22.695
You can't even live. You've already blown it.

547
00:28:22.755 --> 00:28:25.055
You can't do that. Jesus did it for you.

548
00:28:25.235 --> 00:28:27.055
That's the righteousness he's talking about.

549
00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:29.335
That's why listen, that's why

550
00:28:29.335 --> 00:28:30.495
it's not about your past anymore.

551
00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:34.325
It's about your future trajectory.

552
00:28:36.225 --> 00:28:40.355
Because if that is true, the past you have,

553
00:28:40.975 --> 00:28:43.395
that's nasty that you've sinned.

554
00:28:43.605 --> 00:28:44.635
Every one of us has.

555
00:28:45.785 --> 00:28:48.395
It's not about that anymore because it has been washed away.

556
00:28:48.505 --> 00:28:51.155
It's been clean. You have to pay consequence in some form

557
00:28:51.415 --> 00:28:52.995
for it in this life probably.

558
00:28:53.175 --> 00:28:57.075
But it's been washed spiritually clean forever.

559
00:28:57.865 --> 00:28:59.275
It's not about that anymore.

560
00:28:59.465 --> 00:29:01.555
It's about your future trajectory.

561
00:29:01.895 --> 00:29:04.075
And for those of us who are in Christ by faith,

562
00:29:04.265 --> 00:29:05.875
that means there's hope forever.

563
00:29:06.585 --> 00:29:09.915
Because we have a victorious king who beat death.

564
00:29:11.965 --> 00:29:15.185
And that's hope for us. Not only forever, but even today.

565
00:29:16.315 --> 00:29:17.815
He beat sin. He beat death.

566
00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:20.855
We don't have to be defeated by our past, paralyzed

567
00:29:20.855 --> 00:29:22.375
by our past anymore.

568
00:29:22.485 --> 00:29:23.655
There's always hope.

569
00:29:24.075 --> 00:29:28.535
Is that how you are pursuing the Lord today

570
00:29:29.445 --> 00:29:31.745
in that kind of spirit, in that kind of power

571
00:29:32.045 --> 00:29:33.305
of the grace of God?

572
00:29:33.405 --> 00:29:35.385
Or are you paralyzed by your past?

573
00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:38.145
You stuck by thinking that I can't get outta this.

574
00:29:38.175 --> 00:29:39.705
Look at what I've done. I've already blown it.

575
00:29:39.845 --> 00:29:41.765
I'm disqualified. Are you stuck by that

576
00:29:41.785 --> 00:29:42.965
or are you following Jesus?

577
00:29:43.105 --> 00:29:46.045
Say, Jesus the hope future, you've covered my past.

578
00:29:46.325 --> 00:29:47.605
I have hope forever. And

579
00:29:47.605 --> 00:29:49.445
that's the power I'm walking in now.

580
00:29:49.665 --> 00:29:51.685
Is that how you're following Jesus?

581
00:29:54.715 --> 00:29:57.855
Or maybe this you, you see the cost is too great.

582
00:30:00.755 --> 00:30:03.425
Maybe the cost of having to deal with your past

583
00:30:03.485 --> 00:30:05.105
or get rid of it or give it up or

584
00:30:05.365 --> 00:30:06.985
or whatever it is that you have to deal.

585
00:30:06.985 --> 00:30:09.145
And that's a big cost. I gotta give that.

586
00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:10.785
I gotta stop doing that. There's a cost.

587
00:30:12.605 --> 00:30:16.425
Do you see the reward offered

588
00:30:16.885 --> 00:30:18.705
as infinitely better than

589
00:30:18.905 --> 00:30:19.985
whatever cost you would have to pay?

590
00:30:21.225 --> 00:30:22.245
Do you see it that way?

591
00:30:24.115 --> 00:30:26.125
Like we talk about pick up your cross, follow Jesus.

592
00:30:26.345 --> 00:30:30.525
Yes, that's true. But do you, do you see the reward?

593
00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:34.555
Like is it not worth it to follow Jesus

594
00:30:34.775 --> 00:30:36.595
and to say, man, you're worth it.

595
00:30:36.595 --> 00:30:37.715
Jesus said it himself.

596
00:30:37.715 --> 00:30:41.715
Matthew 19, everyone who has left houses or brothers

597
00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:44.515
or sisters or father or mother or children or lands

598
00:30:44.515 --> 00:30:49.475
or let me add to it or sin or selfishness or this thing

599
00:30:49.495 --> 00:30:51.595
or that thing or whatever the world might offer

600
00:30:52.495 --> 00:30:57.115
for my name's sake, he says, will receive a hundred fold

601
00:30:57.335 --> 00:30:58.675
and will inherit eternal life.

602
00:31:01.705 --> 00:31:04.795
What he is saying is that he rewards his people.

603
00:31:07.605 --> 00:31:10.095
He's not a cosmic killjoy just trying to keep you down.

604
00:31:10.245 --> 00:31:11.735
He's saying, I've got better for you.

605
00:31:12.925 --> 00:31:15.295
I've got something way better than what this stuff is.

606
00:31:15.325 --> 00:31:17.295
I've got something way better than you stuck in your past.

607
00:31:17.455 --> 00:31:18.935
I got something way better than

608
00:31:18.935 --> 00:31:20.495
that little temporary pleasure.

609
00:31:20.735 --> 00:31:23.215
I got something way better. Here's the reward.

610
00:31:23.405 --> 00:31:27.415
Come follow me. We're a little hedonistic

611
00:31:27.415 --> 00:31:28.455
in our souls, aren't we?

612
00:31:28.455 --> 00:31:29.615
Like we all want pleasure.

613
00:31:29.715 --> 00:31:31.735
We all look for the the joy of the world.

614
00:31:31.795 --> 00:31:33.935
We want the world stuff. We wanna feel good.

615
00:31:34.325 --> 00:31:38.495
This is the highest pleasure, the highest joy, the highest

616
00:31:39.255 --> 00:31:41.215
satisfaction is in Jesus alone.

617
00:31:41.795 --> 00:31:44.175
He rewards his people with himself,

618
00:31:46.765 --> 00:31:49.815
even through our imperfection by the grace of God.

619
00:31:53.195 --> 00:31:55.255
Here's our third and final truth today.

620
00:31:56.155 --> 00:31:57.695
We need to look at the last verse

621
00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:59.215
of this chapter very carefully.

622
00:31:59.295 --> 00:32:01.135
I want you to see verse 51 again,

623
00:32:05.625 --> 00:32:08.495
great salvation he brings to his king

624
00:32:09.595 --> 00:32:13.135
and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David

625
00:32:13.355 --> 00:32:15.855
and his offspring forever.

626
00:32:19.525 --> 00:32:20.985
You see what David just did there?

627
00:32:20.985 --> 00:32:25.145
There's a transition that he brings where he's praising God

628
00:32:25.165 --> 00:32:28.865
for his salvation, all that he's done to deliver him.

629
00:32:29.245 --> 00:32:32.185
But there's a subtle shift to where he looks forward

630
00:32:32.845 --> 00:32:34.705
to future kings.

631
00:32:37.475 --> 00:32:38.905
Again, we don't know exactly when he,

632
00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.405
he recorded this passage, but it's included here at the end

633
00:32:42.405 --> 00:32:46.765
because the very next verse, chapter 23, verse one says,

634
00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:51.125
these are the final words, the last words of David.

635
00:32:51.345 --> 00:32:54.805
So in some way, chapter 22,

636
00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:57.005
this whole song he writes, Knights

637
00:32:58.765 --> 00:33:00.425
is in preparation for,

638
00:33:01.125 --> 00:33:03.105
and at the last words, kind of at the end

639
00:33:03.105 --> 00:33:04.385
of his life on his deathbed,

640
00:33:04.385 --> 00:33:06.025
these are the most important things he could say.

641
00:33:06.525 --> 00:33:08.025
Here's what you guys need to remember

642
00:33:08.045 --> 00:33:09.185
as you have kings in the future.

643
00:33:12.735 --> 00:33:15.505
Look at chapter 23 verses one through five.

644
00:33:18.185 --> 00:33:21.205
Now these are the last words of David, the Oracle of David,

645
00:33:21.265 --> 00:33:23.005
the Son of Jesse, the oracle of the man

646
00:33:23.005 --> 00:33:25.445
who was raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob,

647
00:33:25.585 --> 00:33:27.045
the sweet psalmist of Israel.

648
00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:30.645
The spirit of the Lord speaks by me.

649
00:33:31.305 --> 00:33:34.485
His word is on my tongue. The God of Israel has spoken.

650
00:33:34.585 --> 00:33:36.405
The rock of Israel has said to me,

651
00:33:37.595 --> 00:33:40.925
when one rules justly over men ruling in the fear of God,

652
00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.765
he dawns on them like the morning light,

653
00:33:42.795 --> 00:33:46.045
like the sun shining forth on a cloudless morning like rain

654
00:33:46.045 --> 00:33:48.085
that makes grass to sprout from the earth.

655
00:33:50.305 --> 00:33:54.295
For does not my house stand so with God, for he has made

656
00:33:54.295 --> 00:33:56.855
with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things

657
00:33:57.275 --> 00:34:00.015
and secure for will he not cause

658
00:34:00.035 --> 00:34:02.535
to prosper all my help and my desire.

659
00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:05.985
I especially love that last verse

660
00:34:05.985 --> 00:34:08.865
where you can imagine David on his deathbed saying these

661
00:34:08.865 --> 00:34:11.545
words, looking back over his life.

662
00:34:11.615 --> 00:34:15.265
He's just stunned in awe that God would choose his family

663
00:34:15.765 --> 00:34:18.705
to be the lineage of the eternal king,

664
00:34:18.725 --> 00:34:20.385
the Messiah, the anointed one.

665
00:34:21.805 --> 00:34:23.175
Like just amazed by this.

666
00:34:23.285 --> 00:34:24.295
It's almost exactly

667
00:34:24.325 --> 00:34:27.295
what he prayed back in the temple when God gave him the

668
00:34:27.455 --> 00:34:28.815
covenant that said, you're gonna have an

669
00:34:28.815 --> 00:34:30.695
eternal son on the throne.

670
00:34:30.905 --> 00:34:33.895
David praised this in second Samuel seven, verse 18.

671
00:34:34.085 --> 00:34:35.855
King David went in and sat before the Lord

672
00:34:35.875 --> 00:34:37.295
and said, who am I?

673
00:34:39.135 --> 00:34:41.035
Oh Lord God. And what is my house

674
00:34:41.545 --> 00:34:44.075
that you have brought me thus far?

675
00:34:44.085 --> 00:34:46.075
There was gratitude here.

676
00:34:47.425 --> 00:34:49.755
There's this humility saying, God, I'm so weak.

677
00:34:49.755 --> 00:34:52.795
Look at this. How could I ever meet the needs

678
00:34:52.795 --> 00:34:54.555
that you have put before me?

679
00:34:54.975 --> 00:34:57.395
God, who am I? Who's my family We're nothing.

680
00:35:00.845 --> 00:35:03.345
So there was gratitude here that God thank you for this.

681
00:35:03.365 --> 00:35:06.025
But there's also in these last words of David,

682
00:35:06.095 --> 00:35:08.625
there's prophetic words here.

683
00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:11.385
Verse three, this king rules justly,

684
00:35:12.375 --> 00:35:14.825
righteously over men ruling in the fear of God.

685
00:35:14.875 --> 00:35:17.705
David did that in part, but he didn't do that perfectly.

686
00:35:17.795 --> 00:35:21.465
David himself, that's why David himself knew his throne,

687
00:35:21.605 --> 00:35:24.705
but a shadow of something that was to come in the future.

688
00:35:26.475 --> 00:35:30.175
He knew that his throne pointed beyond itself

689
00:35:30.315 --> 00:35:34.215
to an eternal king that we know Jesus Christ to be.

690
00:35:34.395 --> 00:35:36.095
And that's the main point of this whole thing.

691
00:35:36.115 --> 00:35:37.245
Of course, first

692
00:35:37.245 --> 00:35:38.965
and second Samuel points us to the king,

693
00:35:39.145 --> 00:35:41.245
the Messiah who's coming, who's Jesus.

694
00:35:42.425 --> 00:35:45.575
But don't forget what God was doing.

695
00:35:46.405 --> 00:35:50.145
Also through first and second Samuel, in spite

696
00:35:50.145 --> 00:35:52.985
of David's flaws, his shortcomings,

697
00:35:54.445 --> 00:35:57.545
God was using David to bring about

698
00:35:57.645 --> 00:35:59.905
and establish his kingdom.

699
00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:05.915
God was using David to establish his kingdom

700
00:36:06.975 --> 00:36:09.835
to begin the process of showing the kingdom.

701
00:36:09.855 --> 00:36:11.355
That's what God was doing, right?

702
00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:16.615
He was setting up a tangible expression of his presence

703
00:36:16.615 --> 00:36:18.735
and his power through his people on earth.

704
00:36:22.405 --> 00:36:25.225
God wanted a people. It's why he created humans.

705
00:36:25.365 --> 00:36:27.225
He wanted a people to reflect his nature

706
00:36:27.405 --> 00:36:28.985
and reflect his character to the world.

707
00:36:29.245 --> 00:36:32.905
He wanted people to look at his children, his people,

708
00:36:33.445 --> 00:36:35.025
and say, that's what God is like.

709
00:36:36.825 --> 00:36:38.525
Now, clearly Israel didn't do that.

710
00:36:38.525 --> 00:36:39.685
Well, we don't do that perfectly.

711
00:36:39.685 --> 00:36:43.725
That's what Jesus was perfectly the true image of God.

712
00:36:43.985 --> 00:36:46.485
Yet we still are called to be that same thing

713
00:36:46.545 --> 00:36:48.845
as God's people individually and together.

714
00:36:49.145 --> 00:36:52.085
The image of God showing the kingdom of God

715
00:36:52.225 --> 00:36:53.605
to the world around us.

716
00:36:53.865 --> 00:36:58.005
And just like David who was weak, God used him through that.

717
00:36:59.285 --> 00:37:03.275
Today He does the same thing through our limitations.

718
00:37:04.385 --> 00:37:05.755
Even through our limitations.

719
00:37:06.135 --> 00:37:08.795
God establishes his kingdom on earth here.

720
00:37:09.545 --> 00:37:11.515
When Jesus showed up, the kingdom of God is here.

721
00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:17.895
He all over the parables. This is the kingdom of God.

722
00:37:17.895 --> 00:37:19.055
This is what the kingdom of God's like.

723
00:37:19.055 --> 00:37:20.735
This is what the kingdom, we should live that.

724
00:37:20.735 --> 00:37:21.735
That's what he's telling us.

725
00:37:22.075 --> 00:37:25.575
The kingdom of God shows up through us.

726
00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:29.075
Think about David. God took a shepherd.

727
00:37:29.215 --> 00:37:30.275
Boy, made him a king.

728
00:37:31.745 --> 00:37:34.005
The eighth Son should never have been that

729
00:37:35.415 --> 00:37:36.875
God took a shepherd, boy, made him mc king.

730
00:37:36.935 --> 00:37:40.515
God took a flawed man, made him the ancestor of the Messiah.

731
00:37:42.505 --> 00:37:45.165
But isn't that the stunning pattern of grace anyway?

732
00:37:46.235 --> 00:37:49.245
Like doesn't deserve it. Shouldn't have it.

733
00:37:50.225 --> 00:37:52.565
You got it Anyway, that's grace.

734
00:37:54.655 --> 00:37:58.595
But listen, don't, God doesn't wait for perfect people.

735
00:38:00.635 --> 00:38:01.925
He's just up there twiddling his thumbs,

736
00:38:01.925 --> 00:38:03.085
waiting for somebody to be perfect.

737
00:38:03.225 --> 00:38:04.485
He doesn't wait for perfect people.

738
00:38:04.665 --> 00:38:07.285
He transforms willing people

739
00:38:07.795 --> 00:38:09.485
into vessels of his eternal purpose.

740
00:38:13.515 --> 00:38:17.015
So don't sit there and think your weakness is some kind

741
00:38:17.015 --> 00:38:18.855
of disqualification before God.

742
00:38:20.605 --> 00:38:21.735
Like you know how weak you are.

743
00:38:21.735 --> 00:38:25.095
You know how limited you are. Ah, man, I'm disqualified.

744
00:38:25.235 --> 00:38:29.255
No, your weakness is the very canvas on which God

745
00:38:29.275 --> 00:38:30.415
paints his glory.

746
00:38:31.685 --> 00:38:35.205
It's how he shows off to the world if you're willing.

747
00:38:37.745 --> 00:38:40.325
And I just thought of, uh, the Apostle Paul

748
00:38:42.935 --> 00:38:47.005
Who's praying for God to take away this physical ailment

749
00:38:47.005 --> 00:38:48.805
that he had that made him weak.

750
00:38:50.525 --> 00:38:52.425
God, take it away. God, take it away. God take it away.

751
00:38:52.605 --> 00:38:54.465
And this is God's response to him.

752
00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:58.465
Second Corinthians 12, nine, my grace is sufficient for you.

753
00:38:58.765 --> 00:39:00.985
For my power is made perfect in weakness.

754
00:39:01.765 --> 00:39:03.025
That's what God said to him.

755
00:39:04.645 --> 00:39:06.825
Paul's like, Hey man, God, can you take this away from me?

756
00:39:06.825 --> 00:39:09.545
And God's like, Nope. My grace is sufficient for you.

757
00:39:09.565 --> 00:39:11.385
My power is actually made perfect in your weakness.

758
00:39:11.385 --> 00:39:12.505
So here's what Paul said back,

759
00:39:12.695 --> 00:39:16.545
therefore, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses

760
00:39:17.085 --> 00:39:20.985
so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

761
00:39:21.965 --> 00:39:24.825
See, when you are weak and God still moves,

762
00:39:25.535 --> 00:39:27.185
it's obvious who's doing it.

763
00:39:29.895 --> 00:39:34.805
My problem most of my life, I think I can do it myself.

764
00:39:37.175 --> 00:39:40.295
I trust my own strength, my own resources, my own abilities.

765
00:39:41.075 --> 00:39:43.385
Which by the way, God gave me all those to begin with.

766
00:39:43.525 --> 00:39:45.385
So I don't know why I'm trusting myself,

767
00:39:48.095 --> 00:39:51.395
but when I do that, when I preach pastor live in my own

768
00:39:51.515 --> 00:39:52.635
strength, who gets the glory I do.

769
00:39:53.825 --> 00:39:56.395
When We as a church use our resources

770
00:39:56.395 --> 00:39:57.555
and we make some stuff happen

771
00:39:57.615 --> 00:39:59.035
and we can accomplish big things?

772
00:39:59.135 --> 00:40:00.395
Who gets the glory? We do.

773
00:40:02.005 --> 00:40:05.425
But when we are weak and we remember that we're weak

774
00:40:05.605 --> 00:40:08.625
and we come to him willing yet still weak,

775
00:40:09.045 --> 00:40:11.305
and God still does something big with that.

776
00:40:11.365 --> 00:40:13.585
Who gets the glory? God does.

777
00:40:14.485 --> 00:40:17.705
The point of this whole thing is for God to get the glory.

778
00:40:19.355 --> 00:40:23.515
And so here's the question. Will you offer

779
00:40:23.615 --> 00:40:25.755
to God your imperfect

780
00:40:26.055 --> 00:40:30.995
and weak life as the raw materials for his perfect purposes?

781
00:40:34.945 --> 00:40:37.805
You're a mess. I'm a mess. So we, we we're weak.

782
00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:40.485
We bring very little to the table here.

783
00:40:40.825 --> 00:40:43.645
All he's asking you to do is just say, okay, God,

784
00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:48.105
take this like five loaves, two fish kind of thing.

785
00:40:48.175 --> 00:40:50.025
Take this and do something with it.

786
00:40:52.765 --> 00:40:54.505
And what did he do with the five loaves of two fish?

787
00:40:55.565 --> 00:40:58.065
He fed thousands upon thousands of people

788
00:40:58.175 --> 00:41:02.945
with a Hebrew happy meal like this.

789
00:41:06.125 --> 00:41:11.115
Are you willing to be used for God's purposes?

790
00:41:15.315 --> 00:41:17.135
God used the weakness of David to prepare

791
00:41:17.135 --> 00:41:18.135
for Christ's coming.

792
00:41:18.355 --> 00:41:20.135
God wants to use you

793
00:41:20.595 --> 00:41:23.495
to advance Christ's kingdom today.

794
00:41:28.765 --> 00:41:33.120
However, I wanna invite the worst leaders out out,

795
00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.125
'cause we're gonna sing here in a second.

796
00:41:34.845 --> 00:41:35.845
I want to be C careful

797
00:41:35.845 --> 00:41:39.005
because I know some of you are going

798
00:41:39.005 --> 00:41:42.995
through a storm right now and it's so cloudy

799
00:41:43.295 --> 00:41:46.395
and it's so dark that you can't even hear what I'm saying.

800
00:41:47.215 --> 00:41:49.635
You can't even hear what God's word has shown us today.

801
00:41:49.855 --> 00:41:51.515
And you're going through that storm,

802
00:41:51.815 --> 00:41:53.275
or maybe you're about to head into one.

803
00:41:53.275 --> 00:41:54.595
You can see it coming on the horizon.

804
00:41:55.545 --> 00:41:59.235
What do you do with that? That's why it is so critical

805
00:41:59.255 --> 00:42:00.555
for us to remember

806
00:42:00.815 --> 00:42:05.235
and rehearse what God has done just like second Samuel 22,

807
00:42:05.455 --> 00:42:08.235
to keep going back to that, to do what David did

808
00:42:08.495 --> 00:42:11.035
and say, God, you delivered me here.

809
00:42:11.355 --> 00:42:12.915
I remember you delivered that person.

810
00:42:13.235 --> 00:42:14.395
I remember you delivered Moses,

811
00:42:14.715 --> 00:42:15.995
I remember you delivered them.

812
00:42:16.215 --> 00:42:19.035
And I wanna celebrate your righteousness to keep going back

813
00:42:19.035 --> 00:42:21.395
to that over and over and over.

814
00:42:21.675 --> 00:42:24.555
'cause the more you remember, the more likely you will do

815
00:42:24.555 --> 00:42:25.795
what Hebrews 13 says,

816
00:42:26.015 --> 00:42:30.635
and continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God.

817
00:42:30.705 --> 00:42:34.195
That is the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.

818
00:42:35.475 --> 00:42:40.115
I said it earlier, remembrance, deliverance leads to praise

819
00:42:41.605 --> 00:42:44.695
When we remember, when we look back and we think

820
00:42:44.755 --> 00:42:47.335
and we reflect on His deliverance, his salvation

821
00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.935
that leads to worship.

822
00:42:50.275 --> 00:42:53.975
And so as we think about all that, God has said to us

823
00:42:53.975 --> 00:42:58.375
through his word in two Samuel 2223, when we see His glory,

824
00:42:58.675 --> 00:43:00.055
we see his power.

825
00:43:00.235 --> 00:43:01.615
Here's my question to you right now.

826
00:43:03.115 --> 00:43:07.095
How do you need him to be that for you right now?

827
00:43:09.455 --> 00:43:12.385
Like, what is the, the storm you're facing,

828
00:43:12.845 --> 00:43:14.225
the enemy you're facing?

829
00:43:14.495 --> 00:43:16.945
What is it in your life right now that you read this

830
00:43:16.945 --> 00:43:18.865
and you're like, God, I I need that from you.

831
00:43:19.945 --> 00:43:22.865
I need that right now. I need you to be my rock, my refuge.

832
00:43:23.185 --> 00:43:26.905
I need you to lead me on a path that keeps me from falling.

833
00:43:27.385 --> 00:43:29.945
I need you to be that for me. I need your salvation.

834
00:43:30.025 --> 00:43:33.065
I need your deliverance. Do that for him right now.

835
00:43:34.855 --> 00:43:38.425
Just cry out to him in that state right now

836
00:43:42.655 --> 00:43:47.105
with a spirit of praise, with a spirit of of submission

837
00:43:47.365 --> 00:43:50.225
to his will, saying, God, I'm crying out to you.

838
00:43:50.455 --> 00:43:52.345
Your will be done on earth as is in heaven.

839
00:43:52.565 --> 00:43:53.785
Do it in my life first.

840
00:43:54.085 --> 00:43:57.025
God, I'm crying out to you for your help.

841
00:43:57.135 --> 00:43:59.185
What do you need him to be that for you right now?

842
00:44:01.815 --> 00:44:05.865
Tell him. Cry out to him.

843
00:44:08.605 --> 00:44:10.625
Be weak. Be needy. Tell him you need him.
