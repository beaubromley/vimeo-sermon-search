WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:01.725
Alright, good evening.

2
00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:04.805
We should meet outside, I think tonight.

3
00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:06.405
That should be beautiful out there.

4
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:11.685
Um, so this is the, uh, culmination of a

5
00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:17.695
couple, what, 10 week-ish series

6
00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:22.495
called First Things First, which we, he did on Sundays of,

7
00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:25.455
uh, of a limited version of each

8
00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:29.095
of those studies on Sundays preaching, talking through it,

9
00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:31.655
and then coming up on Sunday, on Wednesday nights,

10
00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:34.055
following up with that towards what, uh, some q

11
00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:36.775
and A might be and some additional information that you have

12
00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:40.295
to cut to get it to 30, 35 ish minutes on Sundays.

13
00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:42.975
There is a lot more there, of course.

14
00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:45.935
And so we tried to add that in on Wednesday nights

15
00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:48.215
and get a little opportunity to dig deeper

16
00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:49.495
and understand better.

17
00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:51.895
And then help answer some questions.

18
00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:54.695
So, again, tonight's similar to that as we're gonna go

19
00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:57.895
through a little bit of a review from Sunday,

20
00:00:58.245 --> 00:00:59.455
some additional information,

21
00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:02.895
and then get into q and a about it.

22
00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:06.135
So tonight is, uh, Christian Liberty.

23
00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:10.175
So you might've said, or when you saw that topic come up,

24
00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:11.295
you might've thought, does it have to do

25
00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:13.695
with like America Freedom and things like that?

26
00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:17.455
Well, liberty and freedom are virtually synonymous,

27
00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:20.055
but the idea is, what can we do as Christians

28
00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:24.645
and not do in our faith, not under the law anymore,

29
00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:27.365
but how do we make decisions on

30
00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:28.525
what we can do and what we can't do?

31
00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:30.805
So what we did on Sundays, we worked

32
00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:32.725
through one Corinthians eight and nine

33
00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:35.925
and just walk through the whole couple chapters there.

34
00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:38.485
I referenced chapter 10. I wanna hit a little bit more

35
00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:39.645
tonight, just briefly,

36
00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:44.605
but do wanna walk back through just to remind us of, uh,

37
00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:46.565
what God's word says about this

38
00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:49.685
before we get into, okay, what is liberty freedom?

39
00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:51.325
What is, uh, some of these things,

40
00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:53.285
and probably more specific questions

41
00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:54.565
I would imagine come up.

42
00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:58.685
But the point Paul was writing to the Corinthian church,

43
00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.245
of course, was they asked a question about food

44
00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:02.285
offered to idols.

45
00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:04.365
People were sacrificing food

46
00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:06.325
or sacrificing meat

47
00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:08.525
to these idols all over the place in Corinth.

48
00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:11.525
And so people were thinking, well, if I come across

49
00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:13.605
that meat somehow, like if I'm in a market

50
00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:15.085
and just happen to buy some meat

51
00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:17.005
that I didn't know was offered to an idol,

52
00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:18.565
or if I'm at somebody's house

53
00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:20.045
and get offered it, what do I do?

54
00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:22.565
Because some had a sensitive conscience to that.

55
00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:24.965
Other people had a little bit less sensitive conscience

56
00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:27.005
could just say, yeah, fine, we're free.

57
00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:30.245
God called all meat, all food clean.

58
00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:32.085
So what's wrong with eating this?

59
00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:34.645
Versus some people are saying, no, I can't,

60
00:02:34.645 --> 00:02:35.725
I I came outta that world.

61
00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:39.045
Can't do that. Kind of similar to you might say, someone

62
00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:42.965
who was formerly an alcoholic would never go to a restaurant

63
00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:44.685
that serves alcohol or something like

64
00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:45.765
that, or wouldn't wanna go to a party.

65
00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.325
That's just because I, I don't wanna be around it

66
00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:50.165
because I I'm so tempted by it.

67
00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:51.765
I might be falling into it again.

68
00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:54.045
Um, so that was the point of

69
00:02:54.555 --> 00:02:56.485
what they're asking Paul here about this

70
00:02:56.485 --> 00:02:57.565
food offered to idols.

71
00:02:57.565 --> 00:03:01.005
And so what he does, he again, starts with in chapter eight,

72
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:05.315
this idea of how we should be considering each other in the

73
00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:06.795
church, the believers within the church.

74
00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:08.715
First, make sure that we're caring for each other

75
00:03:09.535 --> 00:03:12.755
and, uh, not putting any judgment on each other.

76
00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:16.115
When we have different levels of conscience on some

77
00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:18.715
of these issues, we should not judge each other

78
00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:21.835
for having different levels of conscience on that.

79
00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:24.835
But then also we shouldn't use that for license

80
00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:27.235
and just say, well, I can do whatever I want

81
00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:28.515
'cause this is my conscience.

82
00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:31.435
Saying, well, that could put a stumbling block in front

83
00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:35.115
of someone who might have a, a weaker conscience in that.

84
00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:36.555
Just a different conscience in that.

85
00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.355
So considering each other, thinking about our love

86
00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:41.075
for our brothers and sisters in Christ

87
00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:46.075
as one limiting factor in our Christian freedom, what we do

88
00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:48.985
or don't do, like he says in verse 13,

89
00:03:48.985 --> 00:03:51.305
therefore, if any, if food makes my brother stumble,

90
00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:53.905
I will never eat meat lest I make my brother stumble.

91
00:03:54.645 --> 00:03:56.905
Is that our attitude when we think about brothers

92
00:03:56.905 --> 00:04:00.065
and sisters in Christ, that's a love for them,

93
00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:02.345
that I don't want them to stumble.

94
00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:05.905
But then in chapter nine, he does, uh,

95
00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:08.625
a little bit different angle in the same vein

96
00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:10.705
of limiting freedom by saying these things are limited

97
00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:14.065
by our love for unbelievers, how we treat people

98
00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:16.865
who are not believers, and how we live in front of them

99
00:04:16.885 --> 00:04:18.625
and how we live out our faith in front of them.

100
00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:22.345
So he does a long, I didn't, I skipped it on Sunday.

101
00:04:22.455 --> 00:04:24.545
This, uh, verses one through 12

102
00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:28.185
or so plus some into 15 through 18.

103
00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:32.425
But he defends the right, he has

104
00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:36.745
to get financial assistance from the church to be paid

105
00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:38.305
by the church for the gospel ministry.

106
00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:41.185
He performs. He does a lot of different arguments for that,

107
00:04:41.205 --> 00:04:42.345
and it's very well done.

108
00:04:43.085 --> 00:04:45.145
Uh, but he says it again, nevertheless,

109
00:04:45.195 --> 00:04:46.905
we've not made use of this, right?

110
00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:50.225
We endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way

111
00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:51.505
of the gospel of Christ.

112
00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:55.505
So that's the love for unbelievers that we're end doing,

113
00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:56.785
enduring anything.

114
00:04:58.045 --> 00:04:59.065
And you see Paul do that,

115
00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:00.465
and throughout his ministry, not just,

116
00:05:00.685 --> 00:05:04.185
I'm not gonna get paid like beatings and shipwrecks

117
00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:05.265
and persecutions.

118
00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:10.065
He's like, I'm, I'm taking this face first in so many ways

119
00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:14.545
because of the gospel that I know is going to save some.

120
00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.585
So that's his enduring anything, including

121
00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:22.505
that he's not going to take any financial compensation from

122
00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:24.465
the Corinthians because the people

123
00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:28.625
outside the church would see it as a hired hand.

124
00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:30.985
He's just something that he's just preaching the gospel.

125
00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:32.745
'cause he's getting paid for it. It's, it's nothing

126
00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:34.265
that really is his treasure.

127
00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:37.785
He says, no, I, I have the right to, but I'm not going to.

128
00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:41.345
And so we talked about it was we don't have to,

129
00:05:41.345 --> 00:05:44.185
we're not required to employ or utilize

130
00:05:44.565 --> 00:05:47.105
or take advantage of our rights that we have.

131
00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:49.665
Just because you have the right

132
00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:52.145
to do something doesn't mean you have to do that.

133
00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:58.085
I think there's, there's a lot of Americanism bred into us

134
00:05:58.195 --> 00:05:59.765
that we, we have this right?

135
00:05:59.765 --> 00:06:02.645
And so it's almost like it's at all costs.

136
00:06:02.865 --> 00:06:04.245
We defend it and use it.

137
00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:07.685
And Paul's saying, well, maybe we need

138
00:06:07.685 --> 00:06:09.085
to think differently about our rights

139
00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:12.565
and say, Hey, maybe I can set that aside for the sake of

140
00:06:13.115 --> 00:06:15.845
someone hearing the gospel more effectively through me.

141
00:06:17.815 --> 00:06:20.635
And then he also talks about serving those,

142
00:06:21.035 --> 00:06:24.115
becoming all things to all people, talking to the Jews,

143
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.155
the Gentiles, to the weak, everybody.

144
00:06:26.315 --> 00:06:27.635
I became all things to all people that

145
00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:28.835
by all means I might save some.

146
00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:30.115
He's not saving. Remember that

147
00:06:30.695 --> 00:06:32.355
we talked about this throughout this series.

148
00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:35.355
God is the one who saves, but he uses people like Paul

149
00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:38.595
and you and me, that that's what Paul is talking about.

150
00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:41.955
That I might be used to save some, I do it all for the sake

151
00:06:41.955 --> 00:06:43.115
of the gospel that I might share

152
00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:45.275
with those people in its blessings.

153
00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:47.515
That's the idea of serving, giving my life away,

154
00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:48.515
giving my rights away,

155
00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:53.115
and giving my life away, serving, loving so

156
00:06:53.115 --> 00:06:54.835
that unbelievers would see the gospel

157
00:06:54.975 --> 00:06:56.795
and know it better through me.

158
00:06:57.505 --> 00:06:59.115
That takes discipline, uh,

159
00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:00.795
because he says in 24

160
00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.475
through 27 about disciplining his body like a

161
00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:04.675
an athlete running a race.

162
00:07:05.705 --> 00:07:07.955
He's wanting to love Christ above all else.

163
00:07:07.955 --> 00:07:09.875
And that means he's got to put things, some,

164
00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:13.275
some decisions in place that help him get there.

165
00:07:14.415 --> 00:07:16.235
Now, before we get to that chart, we're, we'll,

166
00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.475
we'll show the chart again in a second,

167
00:07:17.655 --> 00:07:20.075
but I want to go through chapter 10 just briefly

168
00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:22.715
because I, I alluded to this.

169
00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:26.275
The natural reaction to this is that, well, man, I,

170
00:07:27.035 --> 00:07:30.475
I can't do anything If I have to think about believers

171
00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.995
and if I have to think about unbelievers, like

172
00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:37.075
I'm not really free then, like, I'm,

173
00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:39.515
I'm just not gonna do anything because it's so restricted

174
00:07:39.515 --> 00:07:40.635
by my love for everybody else.

175
00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:42.595
Well, first of all, let's not be selfish.

176
00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:45.955
Let's not just think about ourselves here.

177
00:07:46.415 --> 00:07:47.715
Uh, Galatians five, I talked

178
00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:48.835
about this morning with the men.

179
00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:52.835
Like Galatians five says, yes, you've been given freedom,

180
00:07:53.615 --> 00:07:57.715
but don't use that freedom as a means for selfish purposes.

181
00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.055
Like just to serve yourself.

182
00:08:00.755 --> 00:08:03.095
He says, God's given us his freedom to serve others with it.

183
00:08:03.955 --> 00:08:06.055
And so when we think about, well, I just can't do anything,

184
00:08:06.155 --> 00:08:09.055
can I, uh, so we keep going back to the alcohol.

185
00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.655
It's an easy example. But like, well, you're saying,

186
00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:14.855
if I think about believers, that means I can't have a glass

187
00:08:14.855 --> 00:08:16.255
of wine at dinner with any believers

188
00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:17.695
because they're gonna fall into sin

189
00:08:17.695 --> 00:08:19.215
or they're gonna be tempted, or whatever it is.

190
00:08:19.235 --> 00:08:20.895
Or, or unbelievers are gonna think I'm a drunk.

191
00:08:20.925 --> 00:08:23.215
Like, well, so I can't ever have a glass of wine.

192
00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:26.975
Is that what you're saying? Well, no,

193
00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:28.415
but also, let's not be selfish,

194
00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.815
but listen to what chapter 10 talks about.

195
00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:35.695
He, he does further explain himself in a way that does get

196
00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:39.015
to that, that there is a place for it.

197
00:08:39.015 --> 00:08:41.255
And this is chapter 10, verses 23 and beyond.

198
00:08:41.275 --> 00:08:42.935
It says, all things are lawful,

199
00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:45.415
but not all things are helpful.

200
00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.655
Meaning they're, they're not illegal,

201
00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:49.735
they're not under the law.

202
00:08:49.735 --> 00:08:51.575
You're not under the law anymore. So you can do it,

203
00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:54.295
but not all things are helpful, but not all things build up.

204
00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:58.005
So again, he's still couching this thing of like, yeah,

205
00:08:58.025 --> 00:08:59.805
you can do it, but it's not maybe helpful.

206
00:08:59.955 --> 00:09:03.245
It's not maybe building you up or others up. So be careful.

207
00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:05.245
And then he says, let no one seek his own good,

208
00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:06.445
but the good of his neighbor.

209
00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:09.445
But then he answers the question in verse 25,

210
00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:12.725
eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any

211
00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:14.325
question on the ground of conscience.

212
00:09:14.705 --> 00:09:16.085
So he finally answers the question.

213
00:09:16.985 --> 00:09:18.085
He says, yeah, you can eat it.

214
00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:21.565
He'd been talking about it for so long in two chapters.

215
00:09:21.565 --> 00:09:22.845
He says, yeah, yeah, you can eat it

216
00:09:23.745 --> 00:09:26.565
for the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof.

217
00:09:27.535 --> 00:09:28.945
It's all gods, it's all clean.

218
00:09:29.765 --> 00:09:31.785
If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner,

219
00:09:31.785 --> 00:09:33.265
you're disposed to go like you.

220
00:09:33.265 --> 00:09:35.625
Yeah, I can go eat whatever's set

221
00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:37.385
before you without raising any question

222
00:09:37.385 --> 00:09:38.585
on the ground of conscience.

223
00:09:39.325 --> 00:09:40.585
So you're at an unbeliever's house,

224
00:09:40.775 --> 00:09:43.105
they're offering you meat that was sacrificed to idols.

225
00:09:43.925 --> 00:09:45.705
You don't even need to ask. You just eat.

226
00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:47.465
They gave it to you. It's clean, you're fine.

227
00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:49.825
So he answers the question, right?

228
00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:52.065
So he, he said, be careful,

229
00:09:52.085 --> 00:09:53.185
be careful, be careful, be careful.

230
00:09:53.185 --> 00:09:55.785
Then he says, no, actually you can, you can eat it.

231
00:09:56.365 --> 00:10:00.185
But he still watch this verse 28.

232
00:10:00.285 --> 00:10:03.175
But if someone says to you,

233
00:10:03.285 --> 00:10:06.395
this has been offered in sacrifice, then do not eat it.

234
00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:09.995
So again, he says it again, don't eat it for the sake

235
00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.555
of the one who informed you for the sake of conscience.

236
00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:14.595
I don't mean your conscience but his.

237
00:10:16.175 --> 00:10:19.995
Now, when I studied that, it's assuming

238
00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:21.075
that the person who's saying

239
00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:23.515
that is probably a believer who's got a sensitive conscience

240
00:10:23.515 --> 00:10:26.395
about the the meat, it wouldn't be the unbeliever, right?

241
00:10:27.175 --> 00:10:29.275
The unbeliever offered it to idols, he doesn't care.

242
00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.605
But the person who raises a question about it would probably

243
00:10:33.605 --> 00:10:36.205
be a believer that's with you, associated with you.

244
00:10:36.665 --> 00:10:40.525
And they're like, Hey, man, that was offered to, to idols,

245
00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:43.075
and their conscience is weak.

246
00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:45.155
He goes right back to chapter eight, right?

247
00:10:45.155 --> 00:10:46.795
He goes back and he says, Hey, be careful.

248
00:10:47.205 --> 00:10:48.315
Don't cause to stumble.

249
00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:53.475
But then he says this interesting phrase, verse 29,

250
00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:56.675
for why should my liberty be determined

251
00:10:56.675 --> 00:10:58.275
by someone else's conscience?

252
00:10:59.735 --> 00:11:02.235
If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced

253
00:11:02.235 --> 00:11:03.755
because of that, for which I give thanks.

254
00:11:06.635 --> 00:11:09.295
So it almost seems like he's going back on his word there.

255
00:11:09.915 --> 00:11:11.215
He just said, yeah, you can eat it.

256
00:11:11.435 --> 00:11:12.775
And then he said, but if somebody raises

257
00:11:12.775 --> 00:11:13.895
a question, don't eat it.

258
00:11:14.435 --> 00:11:19.335
But then he just says, but I I, I can't be fully restricted

259
00:11:19.335 --> 00:11:20.615
by somebody else's conscience,

260
00:11:21.935 --> 00:11:25.705
meaning my life is not dictated by what this person

261
00:11:25.725 --> 00:11:29.185
or that person in their conscience fully believes.

262
00:11:29.185 --> 00:11:32.385
And so he's, he's playing this middle, I think,

263
00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:35.505
where he says, if I partake with thankfulness,

264
00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:38.225
meaning I have given thanks to the Lord

265
00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:39.265
for his provision here.

266
00:11:39.645 --> 00:11:41.385
Why am I denounced 'cause of that, for which I give thanks,

267
00:11:41.385 --> 00:11:45.615
meaning I see this clean and so I can eat it,

268
00:11:45.615 --> 00:11:49.155
and I give thanks to God for, but this person doesn't.

269
00:11:49.615 --> 00:11:50.955
So here, here would be a summary.

270
00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:53.805
He goes on to talk about, do all for the glory of God,

271
00:11:54.575 --> 00:11:56.125
which will get us to the chart here in a second.

272
00:11:56.185 --> 00:12:00.015
But I, I think what he's saying here is

273
00:12:00.015 --> 00:12:02.255
that you're free.

274
00:12:03.775 --> 00:12:05.795
So in this case, you're free to eat the meat.

275
00:12:07.415 --> 00:12:08.515
You just need to be really careful.

276
00:12:09.985 --> 00:12:14.375
As you do, consider others, both believers

277
00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:17.095
and unbelievers, be really,

278
00:12:17.115 --> 00:12:19.375
really careful about whether you should or shouldn't.

279
00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:22.535
And maybe in your context with this unbeliever, you should,

280
00:12:22.535 --> 00:12:24.855
because that would create some weirdness with that person.

281
00:12:26.925 --> 00:12:28.625
But with a believer, you're saying, no, I shouldn't.

282
00:12:29.205 --> 00:12:31.305
Or somebody raises a question. You should be cautious.

283
00:12:31.325 --> 00:12:32.825
You should be giving yourself to them.

284
00:12:34.635 --> 00:12:39.625
But in the end, let that be about 99%

285
00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:40.705
of the decision making process.

286
00:12:40.965 --> 00:12:43.785
The the 1% you have is your freedom to do it.

287
00:12:45.085 --> 00:12:47.745
So that, that's where we get to that reality of that.

288
00:12:47.785 --> 00:12:49.425
I can't stand here with my conscience

289
00:12:50.235 --> 00:12:51.585
again, alcohol, for example.

290
00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:55.025
Like I've got a conviction towards that personally

291
00:12:55.445 --> 00:12:57.585
as a leader, as a father, uh,

292
00:12:57.585 --> 00:12:59.305
based on addictive personality in my past.

293
00:12:59.465 --> 00:13:02.625
I mean, I'm like, I'm staying away from it. Okay?

294
00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:05.185
But again, I can't stand here and say that to you.

295
00:13:06.055 --> 00:13:08.745
Even sitting there in a dinner setting,

296
00:13:09.345 --> 00:13:12.425
I wouldn't hint like, Hey, you need to, you need to stop.

297
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.985
'cause I don't really feel like I should.

298
00:13:14.045 --> 00:13:15.545
So I don't want you to, I can't do that.

299
00:13:17.445 --> 00:13:19.305
So we have to kind of go both ways with this.

300
00:13:20.445 --> 00:13:22.285
I have to consider others in my life

301
00:13:22.305 --> 00:13:23.765
as I'm pursuing decisions.

302
00:13:24.065 --> 00:13:27.005
But then we also need to, this is where the judgmental part

303
00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:29.645
of chapter eight comes in, not go back the other way

304
00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:32.645
and try to restrict everybody else around me

305
00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.875
because of my convictions, right?

306
00:13:34.895 --> 00:13:36.795
It works both ways in this unity, it's,

307
00:13:36.825 --> 00:13:38.915
it's mutual submission in that.

308
00:13:40.825 --> 00:13:43.075
Okay, so let's go back to the chart.

309
00:13:43.255 --> 00:13:45.955
You put that up for us, please, and see that up there.

310
00:13:45.955 --> 00:13:49.395
This is the flow chart that we ended with on Sunday,

311
00:13:50.645 --> 00:13:53.935
getting to the areas of freedom.

312
00:13:54.915 --> 00:13:56.535
So again, let's walk through this briefly.

313
00:13:56.725 --> 00:13:58.695
This is, uh, I found this on the internet,

314
00:13:58.695 --> 00:13:59.935
and then our team made it look pretty.

315
00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:01.735
The overarching theme

316
00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:03.375
of everything is do it all for the glory of God.

317
00:14:05.065 --> 00:14:08.375
Everything, every decision, every action, every thought,

318
00:14:08.475 --> 00:14:09.575
do it all for the glory of God.

319
00:14:09.575 --> 00:14:13.095
That will, that will limit us first

320
00:14:13.115 --> 00:14:14.415
and foremost in some big ways.

321
00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:18.295
Then does the Bible allow it?

322
00:14:20.085 --> 00:14:23.575
Find the scripture says, no, don't do it.

323
00:14:24.675 --> 00:14:26.175
Simple, simple.

324
00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:28.655
But if the Bible is silent on it,

325
00:14:28.805 --> 00:14:30.335
like the Bible doesn't talk about Dr.

326
00:14:30.335 --> 00:14:34.335
Pepper. Okay, so does the Bible allow it? Yeah, I guess.

327
00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:36.695
Uh, does my conscience allow it?

328
00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:40.455
Well, then maybe there's a conviction in my own heart

329
00:14:40.455 --> 00:14:42.855
that I shouldn't do this or that, or drink this or that,

330
00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:44.095
or whatever it is.

331
00:14:44.215 --> 00:14:46.815
And if it's there, if it's inside you

332
00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:48.215
and it's there, don't do it.

333
00:14:49.875 --> 00:14:52.305
There's peer pressure. You kind of think of kids, right?

334
00:14:52.305 --> 00:14:55.105
You're, you're feeling pressured to go some way.

335
00:14:55.105 --> 00:14:56.945
It's not just kids, it's adults.

336
00:14:56.955 --> 00:14:59.825
We're peer pressured just as much, but I feel wrong.

337
00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:01.385
I feel con my conscience is wrong.

338
00:15:01.485 --> 00:15:03.865
Ah, I don't wanna do that. Don't do it.

339
00:15:05.245 --> 00:15:07.265
But if you say, yeah, okay, conscience allows it,

340
00:15:07.265 --> 00:15:08.745
then you're in an area of freedom.

341
00:15:10.165 --> 00:15:13.065
But that doesn't mean we just go for it. Hold on.

342
00:15:13.415 --> 00:15:17.145
Here we go. There's a set of further questions here.

343
00:15:17.925 --> 00:15:20.185
And it goes to what we talked about here in one Corinthians.

344
00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:21.505
What's the effect on other Christians?

345
00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:24.825
Is this going to hinder any other believers around me?

346
00:15:25.655 --> 00:15:27.505
Love is more important than knowledge.

347
00:15:27.615 --> 00:15:29.705
That knowledge in one Corinthians eight, right?

348
00:15:29.815 --> 00:15:31.185
Love is more important than that,

349
00:15:31.185 --> 00:15:32.945
that I know I'm free, I can do this.

350
00:15:33.005 --> 00:15:36.465
But love wins over that with believers.

351
00:15:37.685 --> 00:15:39.905
And then the second, what's the effect on non-Christians?

352
00:15:39.965 --> 00:15:41.745
The gospel is more important than our rights.

353
00:15:41.755 --> 00:15:44.345
Again, I don't have to, I apply,

354
00:15:45.565 --> 00:15:47.785
employ my rights in every situation.

355
00:15:48.685 --> 00:15:51.665
You don't have to. Nobody's requiring you to

356
00:15:52.455 --> 00:15:54.585
because the gospel is more important.

357
00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:58.065
But then that last question, what is the effect

358
00:15:58.065 --> 00:16:00.665
of my spiritual life or my family's spiritual life?

359
00:16:02.025 --> 00:16:03.505
Spiritual health is more important than freedom.

360
00:16:05.455 --> 00:16:07.665
What am I doing to foster growth?

361
00:16:07.725 --> 00:16:09.265
Is it gonna help me grow towards Jesus?

362
00:16:09.485 --> 00:16:12.345
Is it gonna stir my affections for Jesus? Or is it not?

363
00:16:14.205 --> 00:16:17.965
I think we don't consider that question very often.

364
00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.735
So that was our framework.

365
00:16:24.475 --> 00:16:26.855
And I'm assuming that a lot of our questions will come on

366
00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:28.785
how to apply that, maybe others.

367
00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:31.585
Uh, but that's why I'm gonna bring Steve

368
00:16:31.605 --> 00:16:35.665
and Joe up here with me, elders that will help us to process

369
00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:37.625
through some of these things.

370
00:16:37.755 --> 00:16:38.985
Begin thinking of questions.

371
00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:41.185
Uh, I think we can run some case studies

372
00:16:41.285 --> 00:16:42.905
of this if we would like to.

373
00:16:44.005 --> 00:16:46.385
Uh, but otherwise we were just happy to,

374
00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:48.025
to kind of talk through this.

375
00:16:48.225 --> 00:16:49.625
'cause I know there's, there's a lot

376
00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:51.345
of uncertainty about this.

377
00:16:51.405 --> 00:16:54.345
And I, I mentioned as I was even saying the lists of things

378
00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:59.225
that were sand, you know, and like tattoos and alcohol usage

379
00:16:59.365 --> 00:17:02.665
and, um, plastic surgery and these kinda things.

380
00:17:02.785 --> 00:17:04.305
Like the, there's a list of things

381
00:17:04.305 --> 00:17:06.785
that we would consider third level sand issues.

382
00:17:07.645 --> 00:17:10.945
But the hard part is, okay, how do we apply that?

383
00:17:11.125 --> 00:17:14.185
And even as I said, those that list I was, you, you're the

384
00:17:14.185 --> 00:17:15.665
what abouts were coming up in your mind.

385
00:17:15.685 --> 00:17:17.505
But what about this, well, you said this,

386
00:17:17.505 --> 00:17:19.425
but what about if this happens,

387
00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:21.105
but what about this scenario?

388
00:17:21.445 --> 00:17:22.825
But what about if it, and,

389
00:17:22.845 --> 00:17:26.425
and it can go on forever, so we could be here all night,

390
00:17:27.565 --> 00:17:30.585
but the idea is we wanna help process.

391
00:17:30.585 --> 00:17:33.345
Because the idea of James one talks about needing wisdom.

392
00:17:34.125 --> 00:17:35.305
That's really what this is.

393
00:17:36.805 --> 00:17:41.085
Having the mind of Christ to be able to discern

394
00:17:41.865 --> 00:17:46.025
in the moment, not only what would Jesus do,

395
00:17:46.285 --> 00:17:49.685
but how would Jesus think about this situation?

396
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:54.165
How would Jesus discern which left

397
00:17:54.165 --> 00:17:57.665
or right way to go here to, to think

398
00:17:57.665 --> 00:18:00.705
through it like he would, that's called wisdom.

399
00:18:01.855 --> 00:18:04.875
And to apply it then into a situation that we're facing.

400
00:18:05.415 --> 00:18:07.475
So we wanna help think through that 'cause.

401
00:18:07.755 --> 00:18:08.755
'cause we're growing in that too.

402
00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.515
None of us have a market on this thing,

403
00:18:10.515 --> 00:18:12.955
but we wanna help grow through this together.

404
00:18:13.575 --> 00:18:15.555
And so if you have specific questions, that's

405
00:18:15.555 --> 00:18:19.435
what we're got the mics up here to, uh, to, to look at.

406
00:18:19.435 --> 00:18:20.955
Otherwise, we're gonna have to just riff

407
00:18:20.955 --> 00:18:22.715
and figure out what we get to talk about.

408
00:18:22.845 --> 00:18:24.035
Steve, did you say, what would

409
00:18:24.035 --> 00:18:25.035
Jesus do?

410
00:18:25.185 --> 00:18:26.555
Make sure they're on. Make sure they're on.

411
00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:28.435
Sorry, I don't know if they are. They're on

412
00:18:29.065 --> 00:18:30.875
Like ww JD Yeah.

413
00:18:31.055 --> 00:18:32.955
Yes. Ww Remember the old bracelets, right?

414
00:18:32.955 --> 00:18:34.675
What would Jesus do that was, uh, it's

415
00:18:34.675 --> 00:18:35.675
Not a bad place to Start. It's

416
00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:37.835
a good, good thought process. Yes, for sure.

417
00:18:38.275 --> 00:18:41.445
I don't know. Are they on? They good? Yes. No. So

418
00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:42.445
What would Jesus do?

419
00:18:42.595 --> 00:18:43.765
What would Jesus do? Because

420
00:18:43.765 --> 00:18:44.925
We had those bracelets.

421
00:18:45.005 --> 00:18:46.125
I mean, I had, I had

422
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.125
One. You looked at it right there. Yeah.

423
00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:48.085
Chart. You had one.

424
00:18:49.155 --> 00:18:50.445
Feel free to get to the mics.

425
00:18:50.445 --> 00:18:51.525
We're just kind of talking now.

426
00:18:51.545 --> 00:18:53.165
But what would be a case study?

427
00:18:53.255 --> 00:18:54.365
Let's, let's keep the,

428
00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:57.245
the chart up on the screen if we can please.

429
00:18:57.265 --> 00:18:59.325
And kind of think through what would be a, an example

430
00:18:59.345 --> 00:19:00.645
of a, a way to make a decision.

431
00:19:00.645 --> 00:19:02.645
What's something we could make a decision about before,

432
00:19:03.825 --> 00:19:06.285
or as people are figuring out questions.

433
00:19:07.755 --> 00:19:10.645
It's an example of a way to apply this in daily life.

434
00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:16.605
I'll just say when we, we put that up on Sunday, um,

435
00:19:17.245 --> 00:19:20.405
I thought back to many, many years ago, um,

436
00:19:21.275 --> 00:19:23.045
when my dad would sit down with me

437
00:19:23.045 --> 00:19:25.045
and say, let's talk about how to make a decision.

438
00:19:26.225 --> 00:19:28.645
And so he would get out a piece of paper and a pencil

439
00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:31.285
and he'd say, pros and cons.

440
00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:33.725
And you write down the prose and the cons.

441
00:19:34.385 --> 00:19:36.445
Uh, but honestly, we didn't talk a lot about

442
00:19:37.525 --> 00:19:40.245
spiritual things and how, uh, that prayer would be involved,

443
00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:41.925
that reading scripture would be involved.

444
00:19:42.345 --> 00:19:45.645
But, uh, uh, but a a way of going about

445
00:19:45.645 --> 00:19:48.405
and having an organized way of analyzing issues

446
00:19:48.745 --> 00:19:51.565
before you're making decisions that kind

447
00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:53.565
of brought back memories of that.

448
00:19:54.305 --> 00:19:55.805
And I think that's good.

449
00:19:55.915 --> 00:19:58.605
Obviously, uh, don't know how often we do that.

450
00:19:58.985 --> 00:20:01.325
Um, and then my other question was,

451
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:05.325
and I'll quit, was that, uh, Paul was talking about, um,

452
00:20:06.145 --> 00:20:08.525
eating meat that was sacrificed

453
00:20:08.525 --> 00:20:09.565
to idols and that type of thing.

454
00:20:09.565 --> 00:20:12.325
What, what's an example of that today?

455
00:20:12.385 --> 00:20:13.605
And so we, what does

456
00:20:13.605 --> 00:20:14.685
that, what's, what are we talking about?

457
00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:16.765
Something like that today? What would that be? Yeah,

458
00:20:18.125 --> 00:20:19.925
Somebody come up with a way, an example.

459
00:20:20.055 --> 00:20:22.325
Think about it. We'd love to hear.

460
00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:24.405
Let's, let's walk through it. Joe, anything?

461
00:20:24.405 --> 00:20:29.005
Yeah. Well, as we were walking in, I, I, uh, told, uh,

462
00:20:29.565 --> 00:20:30.725
a pastor that, uh,

463
00:20:31.965 --> 00:20:33.645
somebody's gonna ask about medical marijuana.

464
00:20:35.865 --> 00:20:36.865
So About What

465
00:20:36.865 --> 00:20:38.245
was somebody gonna ask about that?

466
00:20:39.205 --> 00:20:40.885
Somebody, okay, Joe did.

467
00:20:40.945 --> 00:20:42.645
So we're gonna, we're gonna talk about it.

468
00:20:43.185 --> 00:20:44.445
So how, let's just do it.

469
00:20:44.635 --> 00:20:45.635
Okay. Yeah. Let's work through it.

470
00:20:45.865 --> 00:20:48.725
So how would we work through a decision like that?

471
00:20:48.725 --> 00:20:50.565
Because that's an example. People have to decide

472
00:20:50.565 --> 00:20:52.925
or would decide, should I do this or shouldn't I do this?

473
00:20:53.105 --> 00:20:55.485
And what is my, how would we walk through that?

474
00:20:55.785 --> 00:20:59.125
So does the Bible allow medical marijuana?

475
00:21:04.955 --> 00:21:09.455
Are you asking me? You're asking me asking you, man. Do

476
00:21:09.455 --> 00:21:10.575
You, can you find that? Can you

477
00:21:10.575 --> 00:21:12.295
Find that I cannot find in here where, uh,

478
00:21:12.295 --> 00:21:13.655
that is prohibited Okay.

479
00:21:13.675 --> 00:21:14.695
To be correct. Yes. Okay.

480
00:21:14.695 --> 00:21:17.695
So it's, it's not explicit. Like I mentioned Dr.

481
00:21:17.695 --> 00:21:19.135
Pepper earlier, right? That's not

482
00:21:19.135 --> 00:21:20.095
In there. Yeah. Right.

483
00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.455
Okay. So does my conscience allow,

484
00:21:22.455 --> 00:21:23.815
it would be the second question.

485
00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:25.375
Dealing specifically with that.

486
00:21:26.005 --> 00:21:28.655
Does my co would, how would somebody discern if,

487
00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:31.895
if maybe would people be different in that at times?

488
00:21:34.315 --> 00:21:36.595
I think, I think absolutely people would,

489
00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:39.155
would come into it with a, a history

490
00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:42.075
of understanding about the use of, uh, marijuana.

491
00:21:42.655 --> 00:21:45.315
Uh, and it could be very easily something you say,

492
00:21:45.635 --> 00:21:47.595
I absolutely am not going there.

493
00:21:48.035 --> 00:21:50.475
I know too much bad that's happened,

494
00:21:52.015 --> 00:21:53.755
so I'm not going there.

495
00:21:53.945 --> 00:21:55.635
That makes it, that makes it pretty easy.

496
00:21:56.325 --> 00:22:00.525
But then the question is, Steve, what about the person

497
00:22:01.545 --> 00:22:03.125
who I'm, I'm flipping it on you here.

498
00:22:03.125 --> 00:22:07.365
Yeah. What about the person who says, well, it's legal,

499
00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:13.155
so it must be okay, so why not?

500
00:22:13.225 --> 00:22:16.475
Yeah, and I, I think that back in my experience

501
00:22:16.475 --> 00:22:19.395
of working in the city of Evan for so long and being here,

502
00:22:19.495 --> 00:22:23.395
and if someone would've told me that we would have 30

503
00:22:23.535 --> 00:22:26.835
or 40 medical marijuana places in the city limits of Edmond,

504
00:22:27.175 --> 00:22:28.955
uh, 10 years ago, 15 years ago,

505
00:22:28.955 --> 00:22:29.995
however long you wanted to go back,

506
00:22:30.075 --> 00:22:31.235
I was, oh, that's never gonna happen.

507
00:22:31.525 --> 00:22:33.235
Never gonna happen in the state of Oklahoma.

508
00:22:33.745 --> 00:22:37.475
Obviously, wrong. Uh, but I did have a conversation.

509
00:22:37.595 --> 00:22:38.915
I remember when the, the medical

510
00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:40.435
marijuana issue came up for a vote.

511
00:22:40.515 --> 00:22:42.675
I was talking to a person who was a physical therapist,

512
00:22:43.175 --> 00:22:46.155
and they were talking about their patients, people

513
00:22:46.155 --> 00:22:48.555
that they had come into contact with and served and

514
00:22:48.795 --> 00:22:52.035
provided healthcare services that, uh, that

515
00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:56.035
sometimes medical marijuana provided them with relief or

516
00:22:56.035 --> 00:22:58.275
otherwise, they weren't able to obtain that relief.

517
00:22:58.775 --> 00:23:00.835
Now that, that was hard for me to understand.

518
00:23:01.775 --> 00:23:04.035
Uh, but I appreciated their perspective.

519
00:23:04.815 --> 00:23:05.955
Uh, um,

520
00:23:06.695 --> 00:23:09.515
but we've kind of, it seems like sometimes we get way out

521
00:23:09.515 --> 00:23:10.995
of hand with regard to those things.

522
00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:14.555
Um, again, judgment, judging, other people

523
00:23:14.555 --> 00:23:16.235
that gotta be very careful with that.

524
00:23:16.615 --> 00:23:18.515
Uh, and I don't really want, I don't want to go there.

525
00:23:18.975 --> 00:23:20.715
Uh, but again, the, the conscience,

526
00:23:20.835 --> 00:23:22.715
I think I was thinking about that also, you know,

527
00:23:23.655 --> 00:23:26.315
con one man's conscience is different than another man's

528
00:23:26.315 --> 00:23:28.075
conscience or, uh, what, what,

529
00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:29.755
what they feel is appropriate.

530
00:23:30.135 --> 00:23:32.515
Uh, but is there bringing glory to God?

531
00:23:32.975 --> 00:23:35.435
Um, uh, that's, that seems

532
00:23:35.435 --> 00:23:36.915
to be very important to think about.

533
00:23:37.255 --> 00:23:39.235
Um, it's important to me.

534
00:23:39.685 --> 00:23:41.275
God's word says that it has to be that way.

535
00:23:41.275 --> 00:23:42.435
So that's kind of where I end up

536
00:23:43.055 --> 00:23:44.675
as it comes all the way through, isn't

537
00:23:44.795 --> 00:23:45.795
Bringing glory to God.

538
00:23:46.465 --> 00:23:47.475
Yeah. And you have to start

539
00:23:47.475 --> 00:23:48.955
with the fact, is it legal or not?

540
00:23:48.955 --> 00:23:52.675
Mm-Hmm. Right. So, so we're not to break laws, right?

541
00:23:52.695 --> 00:23:55.635
So that would be considered, does the Bible allow it?

542
00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:57.355
You could even couch it in terms of that.

543
00:23:57.535 --> 00:23:59.035
So if it's illegal, first of all,

544
00:23:59.035 --> 00:24:00.755
that's something to think about.

545
00:24:00.975 --> 00:24:01.795
But that just because

546
00:24:01.795 --> 00:24:03.275
something's legal doesn't mean it's right.

547
00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:04.635
Right? Doesn't mean it's good.

548
00:24:05.375 --> 00:24:07.595
Um, but conscience would be a big decision.

549
00:24:07.595 --> 00:24:08.995
That's an area of freedom for some.

550
00:24:09.015 --> 00:24:10.275
But then you have to consider

551
00:24:10.275 --> 00:24:11.635
what is the effect on other Christians.

552
00:24:12.095 --> 00:24:15.435
So there can be some like, reality of thinking, man, if,

553
00:24:15.435 --> 00:24:17.275
if I'm doing this, some other believer's gonna

554
00:24:17.275 --> 00:24:18.555
think the worst.

555
00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:21.115
Now, some of this stuff you will be able

556
00:24:21.115 --> 00:24:24.075
to do completely in the privacy of your home, right?

557
00:24:24.075 --> 00:24:25.075
Nobody will even know.

558
00:24:25.345 --> 00:24:27.515
Okay, so what's the effect on their Christians?

559
00:24:27.515 --> 00:24:28.475
They don't even know. Or

560
00:24:28.655 --> 00:24:30.155
non-Christians, they don't even know.

561
00:24:30.775 --> 00:24:33.275
That's fine. But then number three,

562
00:24:34.425 --> 00:24:36.395
what is the effect on my spiritual life?

563
00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:38.235
Okay? I'm free to do that.

564
00:24:39.255 --> 00:24:42.435
And it may be importantly helpful for someone

565
00:24:42.495 --> 00:24:45.275
who has no other way of means of, of pain relief.

566
00:24:45.345 --> 00:24:48.875
Okay, fine. But is it becoming then,

567
00:24:50.135 --> 00:24:53.755
and this this goes way beyond just this one subject, is

568
00:24:53.755 --> 00:24:54.835
that becoming something

569
00:24:54.835 --> 00:24:58.045
that I'm depending on more than on the Lord?

570
00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:02.455
I'm going to kick some people in the shins with this one.

571
00:25:03.275 --> 00:25:05.935
Coffee can get there,

572
00:25:08.015 --> 00:25:10.085
sugar, I'm talking myself on that one.

573
00:25:10.095 --> 00:25:13.245
Sugar can get there where, and,

574
00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:14.205
and you could fill in the blank

575
00:25:14.205 --> 00:25:15.285
with all kinds of things, right?

576
00:25:15.285 --> 00:25:16.645
Where that third question,

577
00:25:16.645 --> 00:25:17.925
what's the effect of my spiritual life?

578
00:25:18.165 --> 00:25:21.855
I run to Skittles

579
00:25:23.795 --> 00:25:25.235
whenever I feel a little bit down,

580
00:25:26.975 --> 00:25:29.875
or I feel like I need a bit of a, you know,

581
00:25:30.225 --> 00:25:31.315
it's been a hard day.

582
00:25:32.655 --> 00:25:35.385
Fill in the blank right now.

583
00:25:35.415 --> 00:25:36.545
Does it always mean like,

584
00:25:37.295 --> 00:25:38.945
I'll I'll eat Skittles in my life again,

585
00:25:39.005 --> 00:25:40.225
I'm guaranteeing you that, right?

586
00:25:41.045 --> 00:25:43.425
But the reality is, where is that?

587
00:25:43.525 --> 00:25:45.425
And that's, that's digging way

588
00:25:45.435 --> 00:25:47.905
underneath the surface on decisions, right?

589
00:25:49.375 --> 00:25:52.985
That this thing, whatever this thing is, I am depending on

590
00:25:54.265 --> 00:25:56.125
for joy and satisfaction

591
00:25:56.665 --> 00:26:00.205
and life rather than the Lord.

592
00:26:01.145 --> 00:26:02.365
You know, that is interesting

593
00:26:02.365 --> 00:26:05.325
because, uh, in effect that becomes, uh,

594
00:26:05.425 --> 00:26:06.685
an I can become an idol.

595
00:26:07.025 --> 00:26:09.685
And, and that is something you have to watch out for.

596
00:26:10.305 --> 00:26:13.765
Now, here's the other side of that coin is

597
00:26:14.385 --> 00:26:17.365
should we put our judgment on someone

598
00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:21.985
who finds relief using medical marijuana?

599
00:26:23.655 --> 00:26:26.785
Uh, should we judge them? Yeah.

600
00:26:26.845 --> 00:26:28.145
That's another question. Yeah.

601
00:26:28.605 --> 00:26:31.945
And I think one Corinthians eight would say, if it,

602
00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:33.185
if it follows through, it's legal

603
00:26:33.205 --> 00:26:34.585
and all the things like that, and they're,

604
00:26:34.585 --> 00:26:35.985
they're really being careful with it.

605
00:26:36.625 --> 00:26:38.625
Absolutely. Go for it. And we, we should be

606
00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:39.625
Careful. Yeah. I think, yeah.

607
00:26:39.625 --> 00:26:40.065
Yeah.

608
00:26:40.505 --> 00:26:42.825
I, I think that's sort of the caution is imposing my

609
00:26:42.885 --> 00:26:47.325
conscience, uh, on others can be damaging as well. Yeah.

610
00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:50.535
Yeah. And it works both directions. Yeah.

611
00:26:50.535 --> 00:26:52.095
Steve, well, you, you mentioned earlier

612
00:26:52.095 --> 00:26:53.215
the example of alcohol.

613
00:26:53.515 --> 00:26:55.935
We were talking to Galatians five this morning about, uh,

614
00:26:56.675 --> 00:26:59.695
uh, works of the flesh listing them.

615
00:26:59.695 --> 00:27:00.895
Drunkenness was one.

616
00:27:01.755 --> 00:27:04.815
Uh, so if you were under the influence of any kind of drug,

617
00:27:04.815 --> 00:27:06.615
alcohol, or otherwise, uh,

618
00:27:06.715 --> 00:27:09.175
and it altered your, your mind altered your ability,

619
00:27:09.685 --> 00:27:10.975
obviously it's against the law

620
00:27:10.975 --> 00:27:14.175
to be operate in a motor vehicle, whether it's DUI alcohol

621
00:27:14.175 --> 00:27:17.455
or DUI drugs, uh, from what I did for a long time

622
00:27:17.455 --> 00:27:18.735
and prosecuting people for that.

623
00:27:19.355 --> 00:27:22.815
Uh, so, uh, any types of substance, if you had,

624
00:27:23.995 --> 00:27:25.415
it had to be marijuana, it could be anything.

625
00:27:25.515 --> 00:27:29.015
So it ties into the aspect of drunkenness

626
00:27:29.075 --> 00:27:31.215
or things that can, uh, interfere with your ability

627
00:27:31.215 --> 00:27:32.455
to make sound decisions.

628
00:27:32.455 --> 00:27:33.855
And it affects other people too. Yeah.

629
00:27:34.205 --> 00:27:38.415
Yeah. That's good. Got two mics up here.

630
00:27:38.535 --> 00:27:41.335
Nobody's wanting to step up and, and ask.

631
00:27:43.525 --> 00:27:46.535
Okay. So tr is gonna throw, come at us. Okay.

632
00:27:46.845 --> 00:27:50.095
What about open carry? Open carry? Okay.

633
00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:52.575
That's, that's what he said. Okay. Alright.

634
00:27:53.045 --> 00:27:55.335
What about open carry? All right, so let's, let's take it

635
00:27:55.335 --> 00:27:57.095
through the grid right now.

636
00:27:57.095 --> 00:28:01.215
What do you mean? First of all, open carry means, uh, in,

637
00:28:01.315 --> 00:28:06.135
in our context, it means some kind of firearm, not hidden.

638
00:28:06.675 --> 00:28:09.615
It means an open carry of a weapon

639
00:28:09.675 --> 00:28:11.415
of some firearm sort, right?

640
00:28:12.075 --> 00:28:13.455
Am I hitting that, Steve? Is that okay?

641
00:28:13.895 --> 00:28:15.895
I think what most people would believe. Sure. Okay.

642
00:28:16.595 --> 00:28:20.375
So let's think through that. Thank you tr for that one.

643
00:28:20.585 --> 00:28:23.535
Let's do it all for the glory of God, right?

644
00:28:23.955 --> 00:28:28.245
So is can I do that?

645
00:28:29.975 --> 00:28:31.875
Can I open carry to the glory of God?

646
00:28:36.575 --> 00:28:38.875
Yes. Well, you, you've, you've already run, run

647
00:28:38.875 --> 00:28:42.155
through several to get to, to where you're at.

648
00:28:42.705 --> 00:28:45.395
Okay. On your own spiritual health.

649
00:28:45.575 --> 00:28:47.915
So there's still, the question is, is it legal?

650
00:28:48.185 --> 00:28:49.395
Okay. Does the Bible allow it? Does

651
00:28:49.395 --> 00:28:50.395
The Bible allow? Yes. Is

652
00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.195
it legal? Yes. Conscience.

653
00:28:52.195 --> 00:28:55.245
Does your conscience allow it? It must be

654
00:28:55.265 --> 00:28:56.285
or you wouldn't want to.

655
00:28:56.315 --> 00:28:59.245
Yeah. Okay. So then the question is, is it,

656
00:29:00.535 --> 00:29:02.155
what's its effect on other believers?

657
00:29:05.605 --> 00:29:07.225
Is that something your conscience?

658
00:29:08.515 --> 00:29:10.095
Here's a question for the theologian here.

659
00:29:10.095 --> 00:29:12.535
Oh, is that something that your conscience decides

660
00:29:14.335 --> 00:29:16.225
What your, what do you mean? You say,

661
00:29:16.225 --> 00:29:18.025
I'm good with it, but then you say you run it

662
00:29:18.025 --> 00:29:21.545
through the filter of what's the effect on other believers?

663
00:29:22.705 --> 00:29:23.825
'cause people are gonna come

664
00:29:23.825 --> 00:29:26.185
to different conclusions about that, I assume.

665
00:29:26.615 --> 00:29:27.615
Yeah,

666
00:29:28.015 --> 00:29:30.265
That would be one Corinthians eight where he's saying, if,

667
00:29:30.605 --> 00:29:31.865
if meat makes my brother

668
00:29:31.865 --> 00:29:33.265
stumble, I'm never gonna eat meat again.

669
00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:35.505
'cause he's loving them more than,

670
00:29:35.505 --> 00:29:36.945
he's like, I, I have freedom to do this.

671
00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:39.385
I know I do, but I'm loving that person more.

672
00:29:39.725 --> 00:29:43.085
So I'm going to sacrifice in some ways my own

673
00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:44.205
conscience, my rights.

674
00:29:44.625 --> 00:29:49.195
So does that mean you shouldn't if some Christians object?

675
00:29:49.945 --> 00:29:52.155
Well, that's where, that's why I wanted to get

676
00:29:52.155 --> 00:29:53.595
to in one Corinthians 10 tonight,

677
00:29:53.595 --> 00:29:56.315
that he said there is a measure of place where, yeah, okay.

678
00:29:57.215 --> 00:30:00.755
But I think we should be careful even with that to say,

679
00:30:01.025 --> 00:30:02.195
well, yeah, I have the freedom too.

680
00:30:02.195 --> 00:30:03.315
And nobody says I can't.

681
00:30:03.375 --> 00:30:04.995
But even just a few people say I can't,

682
00:30:05.015 --> 00:30:07.475
or a less than half say I can't.

683
00:30:07.475 --> 00:30:12.125
Well, where's the line? I, so we've asked here,

684
00:30:12.305 --> 00:30:13.885
so here's an example at our church,

685
00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:15.325
we've asked for no open carry.

686
00:30:16.335 --> 00:30:18.245
We've, I mean, we can't make that a law,

687
00:30:18.465 --> 00:30:20.725
but we've, we've put signs up, say, no open carry.

688
00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:24.245
And that's for the conscience sake of believers

689
00:30:24.265 --> 00:30:27.605
who would be like really wary of that, just being around it.

690
00:30:28.745 --> 00:30:32.605
Now we know people conceal carry, we have security,

691
00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:34.005
we have, we know that's there.

692
00:30:34.985 --> 00:30:39.165
But the open carry is, is a bit of this different step.

693
00:30:39.465 --> 00:30:41.805
So we've just asked here personally not to,

694
00:30:42.595 --> 00:30:45.005
that would be a question for somebody who's saying, no,

695
00:30:45.085 --> 00:30:46.485
I have the right to do that.

696
00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:48.605
You can't tell me I can't do that.

697
00:30:50.445 --> 00:30:52.825
That's, that's where we're starting to get to some

698
00:30:52.825 --> 00:30:53.985
of this heart issue here.

699
00:30:54.885 --> 00:30:59.665
Why is that more important to you than considering what,

700
00:31:00.415 --> 00:31:03.265
what the authorities would say in that scenario

701
00:31:03.605 --> 00:31:05.545
or what, what you are thinking

702
00:31:05.545 --> 00:31:06.785
of other believers in that scenario?

703
00:31:06.805 --> 00:31:08.305
That's where we're getting to with this,

704
00:31:08.925 --> 00:31:11.145
is if your desire is to flaunt, if my desire is

705
00:31:11.145 --> 00:31:12.825
to flaunt a freedom

706
00:31:14.835 --> 00:31:19.465
above loving someone else, that's, that's a problem.

707
00:31:21.015 --> 00:31:22.015
Yeah. That's great.

708
00:31:24.495 --> 00:31:28.145
Yeah. I remember we had, uh, um, couple number

709
00:31:28.145 --> 00:31:29.425
of years ago, um,

710
00:31:29.645 --> 00:31:32.505
4th of July parade's a big thing here in Edmond.

711
00:31:32.605 --> 00:31:35.505
And we had a person that was walking the parade route

712
00:31:35.505 --> 00:31:36.865
with an open carry weapon.

713
00:31:37.085 --> 00:31:40.385
And it made a lot of people nervous and concerned,

714
00:31:40.645 --> 00:31:43.985
and there were certainly within their right to do so,

715
00:31:44.565 --> 00:31:47.385
but how it affected other people was, was of concern.

716
00:31:47.485 --> 00:31:49.185
And, uh, worked through that.

717
00:31:49.245 --> 00:31:51.625
And, and ultimately he,

718
00:31:51.765 --> 00:31:54.145
he let the parade route at one point in time.

719
00:31:54.285 --> 00:31:58.265
But, um, so TR asked about open carry.

720
00:31:58.765 --> 00:32:03.385
Uh, back to my many years ago, the issue was,

721
00:32:03.485 --> 00:32:04.825
can, can you play cards?

722
00:32:06.085 --> 00:32:08.345
Uh, and so, and can you dance

723
00:32:09.365 --> 00:32:11.945
and can you go with girls that do?

724
00:32:12.605 --> 00:32:14.705
And so that was what we were dealing

725
00:32:14.705 --> 00:32:17.665
with in the seventies in my youth group, uh,

726
00:32:17.665 --> 00:32:19.665
at the Baptist Temple Church in Oklahoma City.

727
00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:21.785
Uh, but then when we were at Falls Creek,

728
00:32:21.805 --> 00:32:24.585
we were playing cards spades, we were playing spades,

729
00:32:24.685 --> 00:32:25.825
and we liked to play music.

730
00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:27.105
And people would move,

731
00:32:27.115 --> 00:32:29.425
there would be some rhythmic movement move in

732
00:32:29.425 --> 00:32:30.465
the cabinets at

733
00:32:30.465 --> 00:32:31.665
Falls Creek matching, matching the rhythm

734
00:32:31.725 --> 00:32:32.745
of the song. So that

735
00:32:32.745 --> 00:32:34.105
Was, that was the goal, just happened to, was a goal

736
00:32:34.105 --> 00:32:35.305
anyway, so

737
00:32:36.005 --> 00:32:37.145
No, they weren't,

738
00:32:37.295 --> 00:32:38.785
they weren't matching the, okay, that makes

739
00:32:38.785 --> 00:32:39.785
Sense. So there, that, that

740
00:32:39.785 --> 00:32:40.365
was a,

741
00:32:40.605 --> 00:32:42.645
a very relevant discussion we had as,

742
00:32:42.705 --> 00:32:45.525
as back in my days in the youth group, could you do that?

743
00:32:46.105 --> 00:32:47.725
Um, and we couldn't.

744
00:32:48.385 --> 00:32:50.885
And some felt very strongly that you could not.

745
00:32:51.705 --> 00:32:53.805
Um, and people would get in trouble for doing so,

746
00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:55.165
And we solved that at our house.

747
00:32:55.385 --> 00:32:59.485
We played Rook because it has numerals on the card instead

748
00:32:59.485 --> 00:33:01.005
of the, uh, royal faces.

749
00:33:01.525 --> 00:33:02.525
So,

750
00:33:02.905 --> 00:33:05.325
But So here's, so this, that's a great example.

751
00:33:05.585 --> 00:33:07.925
Uh, we all have grown up in situations of

752
00:33:10.005 --> 00:33:13.735
regulations and rules put on youth groups or whatever.

753
00:33:13.915 --> 00:33:18.695
And, and to some of us, they could feel really arbitrary,

754
00:33:19.245 --> 00:33:23.655
like, why, what's PO cards like?

755
00:33:25.065 --> 00:33:26.685
And so prob part of the problem

756
00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:29.645
is not being given the reasons for

757
00:33:31.005 --> 00:33:32.345
why those decisions were made.

758
00:33:33.095 --> 00:33:34.105
Okay, great.

759
00:33:34.105 --> 00:33:35.105
If that's the decision,

760
00:33:35.325 --> 00:33:37.185
and here's why, let's talk through it.

761
00:33:37.455 --> 00:33:38.465
Alright? But

762
00:33:38.465 --> 00:33:40.945
so many times we grew up in situations where it wasn't ever given.

763
00:33:40.965 --> 00:33:43.105
So you're here, these arbitrary rules, you're like, what,

764
00:33:43.255 --> 00:33:45.385
what in the world, why, why are we not doing this?

765
00:33:45.455 --> 00:33:48.585
It's fun. Like why wouldn't, so I think that's part of

766
00:33:48.585 --> 00:33:50.505
what we're trying to get to here, is let's think

767
00:33:50.505 --> 00:33:51.785
through it biblically.

768
00:33:52.685 --> 00:33:55.945
Not just don't do that, don't do this, do this.

769
00:33:56.285 --> 00:33:58.665
And we don't have a framework of how to make decision.

770
00:33:58.965 --> 00:33:59.965
Albert

771
00:34:00.615 --> 00:34:02.705
John, this is a perspective, rather the questions,

772
00:34:02.705 --> 00:34:04.105
since we're not having a whole lot of questions,

773
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:05.505
so I'll, I'll share this.

774
00:34:06.035 --> 00:34:08.225
Kathy and I are blessed to have three daughters,

775
00:34:08.725 --> 00:34:10.665
and they all got married within 22 months.

776
00:34:11.645 --> 00:34:15.265
Wow. Tough on dad, but that's a blessing on that.

777
00:34:15.525 --> 00:34:17.665
But anyway, my oldest daughter wanted

778
00:34:17.665 --> 00:34:18.745
to have a dance at her wedding,

779
00:34:19.605 --> 00:34:21.385
and my youngest daughter had a swinging band

780
00:34:21.485 --> 00:34:22.545
at her wedding on that.

781
00:34:22.765 --> 00:34:24.545
But when the oldest, oldest daughter got married,

782
00:34:24.545 --> 00:34:26.345
there was one of the organists at

783
00:34:26.345 --> 00:34:27.465
the church going have whisper.

784
00:34:28.365 --> 00:34:30.225
Did you hear Dr. Franklin's having

785
00:34:30.225 --> 00:34:31.705
to dance at a daughter's wedding?

786
00:34:32.485 --> 00:34:34.185
You kind of hush. You like that there?

787
00:34:34.495 --> 00:34:36.545
Well, I grew up in the f the fifties

788
00:34:36.605 --> 00:34:40.345
and sixties where the Baptist were a denomination of don'ts.

789
00:34:40.875 --> 00:34:43.065
Don't, don't, don't, don't, you, you can throw up there

790
00:34:43.085 --> 00:34:45.225
and rather relationships, which in my opinion,

791
00:34:45.225 --> 00:34:47.025
that drove many people away from the

792
00:34:47.025 --> 00:34:48.345
faith than through the band.

793
00:34:48.625 --> 00:34:50.625
Fortuitously, we've gotten past that.

794
00:34:50.965 --> 00:34:53.705
But anyway, with that background, the youngest daughter

795
00:34:54.045 --> 00:34:55.945
and the oldest daughter had one, had a dance.

796
00:34:56.645 --> 00:34:59.665
And the, the lady who was going out whispering about Dr.

797
00:34:59.665 --> 00:35:02.225
Franks's office, having a daughter having a dance at their

798
00:35:02.225 --> 00:35:04.665
wedding, by the time the third daughter got married had a

799
00:35:04.665 --> 00:35:07.465
swing band, just a wonderful 15 piece swing band on there.

800
00:35:07.465 --> 00:35:08.585
They were fun a lot out there.

801
00:35:09.005 --> 00:35:11.185
She was at there pat feet, you know? Yeah.

802
00:35:11.185 --> 00:35:14.705
Just going with it. So my point is, sometimes in doing

803
00:35:14.725 --> 00:35:16.425
so we can allow people freedom

804
00:35:17.155 --> 00:35:19.665
where they thought they didn't have freedom to doing.

805
00:35:19.685 --> 00:35:22.065
So that's just a little bit different avenue that, uh,

806
00:35:22.545 --> 00:35:23.865
I was unaware of that it's, yeah.

807
00:35:24.045 --> 00:35:26.985
So, uh, instead of being Carol there, sometimes it does

808
00:35:27.285 --> 00:35:28.985
by stepping out, if you've gone through those

809
00:35:28.985 --> 00:35:30.385
and we're good on theory, it does allow people

810
00:35:30.385 --> 00:35:32.105
to have freedom to do so. Yeah,

811
00:35:32.425 --> 00:35:33.305
Absolutely. That's good. That's good.

812
00:35:33.975 --> 00:35:36.185
Alright. Alright. So, um,

813
00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:37.635
Lemme take this out.

814
00:35:37.705 --> 00:35:39.885
So when I look at the chart, I think

815
00:35:39.885 --> 00:35:42.325
that on the first step there tends to be a lot

816
00:35:42.325 --> 00:35:45.325
of maybe debate amongst Christians even about like,

817
00:35:46.905 --> 00:35:49.005
is this allowed in the Bible or is it not?

818
00:35:49.025 --> 00:35:50.205
Is this a sinner, is it not?

819
00:35:51.025 --> 00:35:53.445
And so I'm just gonna drop this example out there.

820
00:35:53.505 --> 00:35:56.445
Should Christians attend gay weddings?

821
00:35:57.665 --> 00:36:01.245
So if we follow the chart, there's no

822
00:36:02.235 --> 00:36:05.765
directive about which weddings we should

823
00:36:05.785 --> 00:36:07.165
or should not attend.

824
00:36:07.825 --> 00:36:10.005
So I'm wondering if you could address that.

825
00:36:10.145 --> 00:36:11.765
Is that a matter of Christian liberty

826
00:36:12.305 --> 00:36:14.565
or can we apply the chart to that

827
00:36:14.905 --> 00:36:16.765
and come to the conclusion that we shouldn't?

828
00:36:17.735 --> 00:36:19.845
Great question. Great question.

829
00:36:19.845 --> 00:36:21.605
That got a, a pastor in trouble.

830
00:36:21.695 --> 00:36:23.005
Could you reach two months ago?

831
00:36:23.785 --> 00:36:27.705
So the question was one example

832
00:36:27.845 --> 00:36:31.665
of the first, first, um, category.

833
00:36:31.665 --> 00:36:32.665
Does the Bible allow it?

834
00:36:32.665 --> 00:36:36.665
There's debate amongst believers at times about whether the

835
00:36:36.665 --> 00:36:37.945
Bible allows this or not.

836
00:36:38.365 --> 00:36:40.545
And so this is sin or this is not sin

837
00:36:40.545 --> 00:36:42.545
and there's differing opinions on certain things.

838
00:36:42.605 --> 00:36:44.705
And so that can even trip us up

839
00:36:44.705 --> 00:36:46.745
before we get down the flow chart.

840
00:36:46.765 --> 00:36:48.385
So this is not the gospel, by the way,

841
00:36:48.385 --> 00:36:50.385
let's just remind this is just a helpful tool,

842
00:36:50.535 --> 00:36:53.665
hopefully helpful tool that doesn't get everything.

843
00:36:53.665 --> 00:36:55.145
It just hopefully gets us down the road.

844
00:36:55.605 --> 00:36:56.945
The specific question was

845
00:36:57.095 --> 00:36:58.985
what about attending a gay wedding?

846
00:37:02.465 --> 00:37:07.125
That's a great question. Did you

847
00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:08.165
want to answer that or, okay.

848
00:37:08.465 --> 00:37:12.605
No, you look like you wanted to answer that.

849
00:37:13.465 --> 00:37:17.525
Um, yeah, David, what'd you? Were you, I think, um, okay. It

850
00:37:17.525 --> 00:37:18.685
Might help. It might help. Yeah.

851
00:37:19.515 --> 00:37:22.135
Wanted speak to It real quick.

852
00:37:22.755 --> 00:37:25.455
Uh, as far as

853
00:37:26.255 --> 00:37:29.335
scripture addressing specifically like tr r's question about

854
00:37:30.255 --> 00:37:35.095
a firearm, they didn't have sig sour 18 round double stack

855
00:37:35.935 --> 00:37:37.255
firearms in Jesus time.

856
00:37:38.115 --> 00:37:41.895
But the intent of the scripture, even with regard to

857
00:37:42.415 --> 00:37:46.815
marriage and relation in terms of the intent

858
00:37:46.815 --> 00:37:49.255
of the scripture may not say specifically

859
00:37:50.275 --> 00:37:51.855
or bear it out specifically,

860
00:37:51.915 --> 00:37:56.575
but the intent of the scripture, like when Jesus said, those

861
00:37:56.635 --> 00:37:58.815
who draw the sword will die by the sword.

862
00:38:00.715 --> 00:38:04.815
The sword was the weapon of choice at that time for, uh,

863
00:38:05.755 --> 00:38:10.455
uh, a weapon that would be used for defense

864
00:38:10.995 --> 00:38:12.415
and obviously a,

865
00:38:12.535 --> 00:38:14.935
a very lethal weapon at that time that was carried.

866
00:38:15.715 --> 00:38:19.815
So the intent of the scripture is where I would probably on

867
00:38:19.815 --> 00:38:23.575
that first, uh, filter, uh, is where I would try

868
00:38:23.575 --> 00:38:27.295
to look really hard at is what scripture's really telling us

869
00:38:27.435 --> 00:38:29.775
by intent based on that time

870
00:38:29.835 --> 00:38:32.935
and how it relates to what we use today for a weapon

871
00:38:33.075 --> 00:38:34.615
or for relations.

872
00:38:35.545 --> 00:38:39.445
So it just adds more complexity to the answer. But

873
00:38:39.955 --> 00:38:41.685
Yeah, That's all.

874
00:38:42.275 --> 00:38:44.365
Yeah, that's a good point. And that, that would be,

875
00:38:44.795 --> 00:38:45.925
does the Bible allow it?

876
00:38:45.925 --> 00:38:48.525
There is a lot underneath that question for sure.

877
00:38:49.465 --> 00:38:53.005
So for example, about this specific example,

878
00:38:53.155 --> 00:38:56.045
does the Bible allow what is being done

879
00:38:57.145 --> 00:38:58.325
in the ceremony?

880
00:38:59.145 --> 00:39:01.205
We would biblically say no.

881
00:39:02.155 --> 00:39:06.575
Uh, that that actual marriage is not God ordained marriage

882
00:39:06.685 --> 00:39:09.295
between a man and a woman, a male and female.

883
00:39:09.555 --> 00:39:13.575
So in that context, the Bible doesn't allow that.

884
00:39:14.755 --> 00:39:18.495
Now the question is, does the Bible allow us to attend that

885
00:39:19.015 --> 00:39:20.135
ceremony of whatever that is?

886
00:39:21.925 --> 00:39:25.055
Well, that would be, I could see where people would say

887
00:39:25.055 --> 00:39:26.415
that's a conscience decision.

888
00:39:28.395 --> 00:39:33.055
But in the context of that first overarching, the glory

889
00:39:33.055 --> 00:39:37.495
of God, so often, this again gets to

890
00:39:37.495 --> 00:39:39.375
that first category of the Bible.

891
00:39:39.635 --> 00:39:44.575
So often he ties his glory through marriage, the example

892
00:39:44.635 --> 00:39:47.735
of marriage, the gospel, Jesus and his bride.

893
00:39:48.235 --> 00:39:51.455
And, and he paints this picture of the glory

894
00:39:52.365 --> 00:39:53.975
shining through that.

895
00:39:55.275 --> 00:39:57.135
So for us as believers

896
00:39:57.155 --> 00:40:00.375
who believe this truth about the Bible saying this is

897
00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:04.315
what marriage is, I would say

898
00:40:04.505 --> 00:40:07.395
that we wouldn't even get past that first box

899
00:40:08.845 --> 00:40:12.065
to attend a wedding that would be contrary to

900
00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:13.425
what we believe the Bible says.

901
00:40:15.205 --> 00:40:19.385
Now, the question I would follow up with, which is what got

902
00:40:20.025 --> 00:40:22.225
a pastor in trouble a couple months ago on this very

903
00:40:22.225 --> 00:40:26.995
subject, is we're not asking should we love

904
00:40:27.115 --> 00:40:30.435
those people involved in that ceremony.

905
00:40:31.745 --> 00:40:33.875
That I don't think is a conscious decision.

906
00:40:34.075 --> 00:40:35.555
I don't think the Bible forbids that.

907
00:40:35.715 --> 00:40:38.035
I don't think that that's an area of freedom.

908
00:40:38.275 --> 00:40:40.635
I think that's a way we're commanded to love

909
00:40:41.675 --> 00:40:43.835
a person made in the image of God no matter

910
00:40:43.835 --> 00:40:47.035
what they're doing, sin issues, those kind of things.

911
00:40:48.255 --> 00:40:51.075
But love does not demand that I agree with everything

912
00:40:51.075 --> 00:40:54.195
that person does or that I affirm what they are doing

913
00:40:54.255 --> 00:40:56.115
or that I support everything they do.

914
00:40:57.055 --> 00:40:59.875
So there's a measure of saying I can love them

915
00:40:59.935 --> 00:41:02.715
and they can know that I love them, even when I choose not

916
00:41:02.715 --> 00:41:03.875
to come to that ceremony.

917
00:41:05.065 --> 00:41:08.235
Hopefully they, they can Now, people will tie affirmation

918
00:41:08.235 --> 00:41:10.155
with love in our culture, all of that.

919
00:41:10.215 --> 00:41:13.435
But, but the reality is my job is to love them.

920
00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:15.675
And for that specific decision,

921
00:41:15.835 --> 00:41:17.555
I cannot affirm that biblically.

922
00:41:18.255 --> 00:41:19.475
So I'm not going to,

923
00:41:19.895 --> 00:41:24.115
and then I'm gonna work the best I can to love them towards

924
00:41:25.005 --> 00:41:28.715
Jesus, his good news in that. So I wouldn't go,

925
00:41:29.145 --> 00:41:33.075
Yeah, I think at the same time, uh, as you might say

926
00:41:33.125 --> 00:41:36.565
that marriage is not an, it's not a marriage,

927
00:41:36.915 --> 00:41:38.005
it's not a biblical marriage.

928
00:41:38.355 --> 00:41:41.325
However, attending the ceremony may be a matter

929
00:41:41.325 --> 00:41:43.245
of conscience for some.

930
00:41:43.465 --> 00:41:46.725
And John has said, well, in his mind, uh,

931
00:41:46.825 --> 00:41:47.765
his conscience wouldn't,

932
00:41:47.765 --> 00:41:49.045
conscience wouldn't allow him to do that.

933
00:41:49.605 --> 00:41:52.445
I believe that's where you made that break.

934
00:41:53.245 --> 00:41:57.005
I think other people could conscience, believers,

935
00:41:57.135 --> 00:41:59.445
conscience could say, I want to go to support

936
00:42:01.045 --> 00:42:04.175
that individual, let them know that I I care for them

937
00:42:04.885 --> 00:42:07.455
without condoning the, uh,

938
00:42:09.035 --> 00:42:11.335
ceremony. So

939
00:42:11.735 --> 00:42:13.655
I actually stopped before the conscience issue.

940
00:42:13.655 --> 00:42:16.135
You did? Okay. I stopped at the biblical side of that.

941
00:42:16.725 --> 00:42:18.935
Okay. And I, I'm, I'm saying it, I,

942
00:42:19.095 --> 00:42:23.575
I think other people might slip as far as attending

943
00:42:24.805 --> 00:42:25.985
as a matter of conscience.

944
00:42:26.045 --> 00:42:27.545
And again, I think that's where you get into,

945
00:42:28.135 --> 00:42:32.025
it's why it's a Christian liberty issue is

946
00:42:32.265 --> 00:42:33.785
'cause different people I think are gonna come

947
00:42:33.785 --> 00:42:35.145
down differently.

948
00:42:37.395 --> 00:42:39.335
But then you have to ask the further questions too.

949
00:42:39.875 --> 00:42:42.055
Yes. What's the effect on other Christians then?

950
00:42:42.055 --> 00:42:43.735
If that's the case, somebody is Mm-Hmm.

951
00:42:43.815 --> 00:42:45.495
Well, other believers are gonna see that

952
00:42:45.635 --> 00:42:47.215
and really be offended by that.

953
00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:49.935
Yes. In fact, on non-Christians, they're gonna think,

954
00:42:50.055 --> 00:42:52.575
I affirm I'm affirming at this good point.

955
00:42:52.595 --> 00:42:54.575
And what's the effect of my spiritual life? Am I slip?

956
00:42:54.735 --> 00:42:57.135
I there's mm-Hmm. So that, that's a tough one. It is.

957
00:42:57.195 --> 00:42:59.055
But that's, so that's why I even stopped before that.

958
00:42:59.375 --> 00:43:03.575
I think it's a biblical thing that says, no, Janie,

959
00:43:04.195 --> 00:43:07.815
Uh, the next one that would come up in our society today

960
00:43:09.015 --> 00:43:11.715
is because many are required

961
00:43:11.895 --> 00:43:15.115
to do this in their work settings or whatever.

962
00:43:18.125 --> 00:43:21.665
Should I agree to call someone

963
00:43:23.405 --> 00:43:26.785
by their preferred pronouns

964
00:43:28.845 --> 00:43:32.235
other than he or her or they,

965
00:43:32.955 --> 00:43:37.605
because scripture is pretty clear starting in Genesis

966
00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:40.965
that God created us male and female.

967
00:43:42.265 --> 00:43:45.765
So do I participate in their delusion

968
00:43:45.865 --> 00:43:49.925
and allow them to continue with that thinking

969
00:43:50.745 --> 00:43:51.805
or in love?

970
00:43:52.665 --> 00:43:54.285
Do I tell them, I'm sorry,

971
00:43:54.545 --> 00:43:57.955
but I don't believe that

972
00:43:58.535 --> 00:44:02.815
and I cannot call you what you are not.

973
00:44:04.215 --> 00:44:06.815
Hmm. That's, thanks, Janie. That's good.

974
00:44:08.365 --> 00:44:09.455
Another great question.

975
00:44:12.055 --> 00:44:14.455
Stepping all into it tonight, aren't we, Steve?

976
00:44:14.695 --> 00:44:16.175
I mean, I, I've become aware

977
00:44:16.315 --> 00:44:19.775
and, uh, just like Janie said that, uh,

978
00:44:20.355 --> 00:44:21.775
for email communications

979
00:44:21.795 --> 00:44:25.895
and there would be, uh, preferred pronouns listed as part

980
00:44:25.895 --> 00:44:28.615
of like the, the signature line and that type of thing.

981
00:44:29.235 --> 00:44:33.845
Uh, and I think that, um, if I was required by my employer

982
00:44:34.025 --> 00:44:38.035
to add something like that, uh, as, as part

983
00:44:38.035 --> 00:44:42.035
of my correspondence, I, I, my, the way I've answered

984
00:44:42.035 --> 00:44:43.315
that question, I haven't been required.

985
00:44:43.375 --> 00:44:44.955
And now I'm retired. So I guess it doesn't matter.

986
00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:48.235
But, uh, I think if my employer told me that I had to do it,

987
00:44:48.235 --> 00:44:51.115
that say that, then I would say, I'm not going to do that.

988
00:44:53.305 --> 00:44:55.525
And then we'll see where the chips would fall.

989
00:44:56.185 --> 00:44:57.325
Uh, and I, I would,

990
00:44:57.585 --> 00:45:00.325
and I've, in business context, I've seen that

991
00:45:00.625 --> 00:45:04.765
and I've always addressed the person, um, by their name, um,

992
00:45:04.985 --> 00:45:06.885
not by a particular pronoun or anything like that.

993
00:45:07.225 --> 00:45:10.085
And, uh, has it been a big issue?

994
00:45:10.145 --> 00:45:12.165
It seemed like it's kind of, at least recently,

995
00:45:12.165 --> 00:45:14.285
it seemed like it kind of died down a little bit in the

996
00:45:14.485 --> 00:45:15.805
business correspondence that I saw.

997
00:45:16.305 --> 00:45:17.805
Um, but that's an excellent question.

998
00:45:17.845 --> 00:45:20.685
I mean, and again, if I was required to do that,

999
00:45:20.765 --> 00:45:21.925
I think I would have to say no.

1000
00:45:22.385 --> 00:45:24.165
And that would be probably a,

1001
00:45:24.245 --> 00:45:25.845
a line drawing situation for me.

1002
00:45:26.305 --> 00:45:28.965
Uh, that's just, that would be how I would handle it.

1003
00:45:30.885 --> 00:45:34.345
So, well, that would be my response as well.

1004
00:45:35.165 --> 00:45:37.305
But, uh, I wouldn't condemn someone

1005
00:45:37.885 --> 00:45:40.705
if they were in under an authority at work.

1006
00:45:41.125 --> 00:45:42.425
And they're required to do that.

1007
00:45:42.785 --> 00:45:46.915
I, I don't think the Bible demands, uh, that they resign,

1008
00:45:47.985 --> 00:45:49.965
uh, or, or that they refuse to.

1009
00:45:51.025 --> 00:45:55.845
Uh, it's a, it's an artifice that allows, uh,

1010
00:45:57.425 --> 00:45:58.605
people to, uh,

1011
00:46:00.885 --> 00:46:02.565
describe themselves as something they're not.

1012
00:46:02.825 --> 00:46:03.845
That's confusing.

1013
00:46:03.845 --> 00:46:07.005
And it's not in alignment with God's order. Mm-Hmm.

1014
00:46:07.905 --> 00:46:09.605
Uh, but I think there is the issue

1015
00:46:09.625 --> 00:46:13.325
of whether you're under someone else's authority, uh,

1016
00:46:13.385 --> 00:46:14.605
and they're requiring that.

1017
00:46:16.675 --> 00:46:19.165
Yeah. But there might be a time where you feel like,

1018
00:46:20.125 --> 00:46:23.805
I need to, I need to take a stand in that and,

1019
00:46:24.065 --> 00:46:26.765
and I'm gonna lose my job because of it

1020
00:46:26.975 --> 00:46:27.975
Could be.

1021
00:46:28.035 --> 00:46:31.925
Okay. Well, So, so is it loving

1022
00:46:32.785 --> 00:46:37.625
on our part to not

1023
00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:41.335
speak the truth to them in a loving way?

1024
00:46:42.825 --> 00:46:47.795
Because when we fail to speak the truth

1025
00:46:49.505 --> 00:46:52.725
and allow them to believe these lies,

1026
00:46:53.595 --> 00:46:56.485
it's detrimental not only to their physical health,

1027
00:46:56.745 --> 00:46:58.765
but also to their spiritual health

1028
00:47:00.095 --> 00:47:01.275
and their emotional health.

1029
00:47:04.575 --> 00:47:06.225
Yeah. I think there's a measure of

1030
00:47:07.345 --> 00:47:09.665
relationship needed.

1031
00:47:10.845 --> 00:47:14.105
Um, Jesus didn't address everything he faced.

1032
00:47:16.185 --> 00:47:20.045
Uh, you would see Paul walking through Athens.

1033
00:47:20.745 --> 00:47:22.395
He didn't call out everything he saw.

1034
00:47:23.775 --> 00:47:25.675
So there's a measure of I think

1035
00:47:26.555 --> 00:47:28.915
watching when God brings an opportunity to do that.

1036
00:47:30.305 --> 00:47:35.125
And I'm pretty sure in our context that somebody in, in

1037
00:47:35.125 --> 00:47:37.245
that scenario, they've heard that before.

1038
00:47:38.315 --> 00:47:40.335
Now maybe it wasn't done in love, right?

1039
00:47:40.365 --> 00:47:43.335
That would be the goal. But they, they've heard the truth,

1040
00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:45.415
uh, of, of what they've,

1041
00:47:45.995 --> 00:47:48.255
and probably have rebelled against it in some ways.

1042
00:47:49.435 --> 00:47:54.425
So, can I love them differently

1043
00:47:55.165 --> 00:47:58.655
in a way that allows me the opportunity

1044
00:47:58.755 --> 00:48:00.735
to have the opportunity to share that,

1045
00:48:02.115 --> 00:48:03.975
uh, that's, that's tough.

1046
00:48:04.845 --> 00:48:08.575
There's a lot of coldness, standoffishness in that.

1047
00:48:08.755 --> 00:48:12.395
But we don't have

1048
00:48:12.395 --> 00:48:14.155
to speak up about everything.

1049
00:48:14.835 --> 00:48:17.915
'cause if we did, we'd be constantly on social media,

1050
00:48:17.925 --> 00:48:19.395
constantly doing every, I mean,

1051
00:48:19.395 --> 00:48:22.315
it would be a blast all the time.

1052
00:48:24.015 --> 00:48:25.395
That's where wisdom comes in.

1053
00:48:25.485 --> 00:48:28.715
Where does God want me to speak up in this situation?

1054
00:48:28.715 --> 00:48:30.275
Do I have an opportunity? Do I have a relationship?

1055
00:48:30.295 --> 00:48:32.555
Do we have trust? Is there a way to to address that?

1056
00:48:32.905 --> 00:48:34.395
Then that would be a much more likely.

1057
00:48:35.375 --> 00:48:37.155
Um, I'm not a big fan

1058
00:48:37.155 --> 00:48:38.955
of people standing on the corners and protesting.

1059
00:48:39.095 --> 00:48:41.115
That's, that's just, I don't think that is

1060
00:48:41.145 --> 00:48:42.275
what God intended.

1061
00:48:43.095 --> 00:48:45.995
Um, but I do think there's a measure of speaking the truth

1062
00:48:45.995 --> 00:48:47.355
and love when there's a relationship there

1063
00:48:47.355 --> 00:48:49.715
and there's an opportunity that they know I care about them

1064
00:48:49.865 --> 00:48:52.795
because I've shown it to 'em for however long.

1065
00:48:53.465 --> 00:48:56.525
Yeah. It's tough though. That's a really hard one.

1066
00:48:56.715 --> 00:49:00.225
Yeah. I, I have difficulty, um,

1067
00:49:02.235 --> 00:49:05.285
affirming delusional thinking,

1068
00:49:05.285 --> 00:49:09.605
because I'm thinking of this from a psychology background.

1069
00:49:10.425 --> 00:49:14.515
Yeah. Secondarily, yeah. Or a spiritual background first.

1070
00:49:14.775 --> 00:49:18.515
But then from a, a psychology background, secondarily,

1071
00:49:18.825 --> 00:49:21.035
Sure, there's things in my life I've had to come to,

1072
00:49:21.665 --> 00:49:23.115
I've heard it over and over again,

1073
00:49:23.115 --> 00:49:25.195
but there's things I've had to grow into understanding.

1074
00:49:25.375 --> 00:49:26.835
And it took the Lord's change.

1075
00:49:26.975 --> 00:49:29.395
Not, I heard it 25 times from somebody,

1076
00:49:29.395 --> 00:49:30.435
or people along the way.

1077
00:49:30.575 --> 00:49:34.725
It took me some, a seed planted here, seed planted there,

1078
00:49:34.725 --> 00:49:36.765
and then finally at Boer Fruit 10 years later.

1079
00:49:37.345 --> 00:49:39.525
So there could be a measure of that. So Joe,

1080
00:49:41.805 --> 00:49:43.505
You had a, I'm gonna pull this up.

1081
00:49:43.505 --> 00:49:45.905
It's a little low. Uh, so you had pointed about,

1082
00:49:45.965 --> 00:49:48.225
talked about it earlier, about the line drawn.

1083
00:49:48.565 --> 00:49:51.665
Um, and I can't think of a specific example exactly.

1084
00:49:51.985 --> 00:49:54.225
I think maybe you'd see it more in a closer group

1085
00:49:54.225 --> 00:49:55.625
of like friends of believers.

1086
00:49:56.365 --> 00:49:59.545
Um, but what if you get into a situation where one group

1087
00:49:59.685 --> 00:50:02.225
or one side of your friends might be offended

1088
00:50:02.285 --> 00:50:03.545
by you making one decision,

1089
00:50:03.965 --> 00:50:07.305
or it may be guilty on their conscience if you make one

1090
00:50:07.465 --> 00:50:09.745
decision, and then the latter the other way,

1091
00:50:09.885 --> 00:50:12.105
or the vice versa.

1092
00:50:12.205 --> 00:50:15.665
The other way is you there if this other group is offended

1093
00:50:15.685 --> 00:50:18.065
or it's guilty on their conscience, if you,

1094
00:50:18.165 --> 00:50:20.745
and so you're kind of at that crossroads of like, who do I,

1095
00:50:21.205 --> 00:50:22.465
you know, what side do I pick?

1096
00:50:22.885 --> 00:50:24.665
You're stuck between, you're going

1097
00:50:24.665 --> 00:50:25.985
to offend somebody either way.

1098
00:50:26.005 --> 00:50:29.725
Is that what you're saying? Yes, exactly. Oh man.

1099
00:50:30.355 --> 00:50:32.165
That, okay. You may

1100
00:50:32.165 --> 00:50:33.445
Be by yourself for a while.

1101
00:50:34.495 --> 00:50:39.165
Sorry. Uh, I, I, I think there's a measure of,

1102
00:50:42.795 --> 00:50:46.775
if, if this is a circle of Christian friends, that's

1103
00:50:46.775 --> 00:50:50.005
where a conversations need to happen, right?

1104
00:50:50.065 --> 00:50:53.165
If that's where a decision is gonna split the group,

1105
00:50:55.105 --> 00:50:58.795
like hold up, like, let's, let's talk about this.

1106
00:50:59.055 --> 00:51:01.675
Why do we, why do we feel so strongly about this issue?

1107
00:51:01.895 --> 00:51:04.235
And it's a, it's not, number one, it's a conscience issue.

1108
00:51:04.235 --> 00:51:06.715
Like, why are we so strong? What is happening here?

1109
00:51:07.415 --> 00:51:10.045
Let's just tone it down. Let's calm it down. Let's talk.

1110
00:51:10.895 --> 00:51:12.125
Where do we see this in God's word?

1111
00:51:12.125 --> 00:51:15.005
How can we make a decision? How can we give

1112
00:51:15.505 --> 00:51:17.085
to each other instead

1113
00:51:17.085 --> 00:51:19.045
of feeling I'm in the right and all that?

1114
00:51:19.305 --> 00:51:22.085
So I think that could happen hopefully in a context

1115
00:51:22.085 --> 00:51:23.085
that you're describing.

1116
00:51:24.265 --> 00:51:26.045
And it may end up that that turns

1117
00:51:26.355 --> 00:51:28.965
that this group ends up here and this group ends up here.

1118
00:51:28.985 --> 00:51:32.885
And that's fine. Um, Paul and Barnabas

1119
00:51:32.945 --> 00:51:36.965
and John Mark, they had a different perspective and well,

1120
00:51:36.965 --> 00:51:39.845
And there are different denominations for reasons that,

1121
00:51:39.905 --> 00:51:41.565
uh, aren't big rocks.

1122
00:51:43.095 --> 00:51:46.545
Yeah. But do not, this is Romans 1420.

1123
00:51:46.565 --> 00:51:49.225
Do not for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Right?

1124
00:51:49.525 --> 00:51:51.945
The work of God is the church. Unity.

1125
00:51:53.295 --> 00:51:54.405
Don't for the sake of food

1126
00:51:54.405 --> 00:51:57.125
or for conscience, destroy the work of God.

1127
00:51:57.665 --> 00:52:00.495
We gotta be over caring,

1128
00:52:00.635 --> 00:52:02.775
loving each other. So, go ahead.

1129
00:52:03.295 --> 00:52:04.775
I would just add to, um,

1130
00:52:05.205 --> 00:52:09.135
what the young lady said a little bit ago about, um, whether

1131
00:52:09.135 --> 00:52:10.535
or not to affirm somebody

1132
00:52:10.535 --> 00:52:12.615
using pronouns and things like that.

1133
00:52:12.645 --> 00:52:15.055
Even, even, even what this young man said,

1134
00:52:15.975 --> 00:52:18.815
I would just go right back to one, do it all for the glory

1135
00:52:18.815 --> 00:52:20.375
of God in regards to creation.

1136
00:52:21.035 --> 00:52:22.265
We start there.

1137
00:52:22.725 --> 00:52:26.825
And then secondly, you know, does the Bible allow us to lie?

1138
00:52:28.555 --> 00:52:32.825
And it seems like it ends there, you know, so in regards to,

1139
00:52:32.965 --> 00:52:35.665
you know, loving the person and, you know,

1140
00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.105
and kind of affirming it for a while,

1141
00:52:37.265 --> 00:52:38.585
'cause you're afraid to lose your job or whatever.

1142
00:52:38.585 --> 00:52:41.905
That's, that's all humanly understandable. Absolutely.

1143
00:52:42.525 --> 00:52:47.005
But in regards to, does the Bible allow us to lie in an,

1144
00:52:47.065 --> 00:52:49.085
as an answer to somebody like that?

1145
00:52:49.325 --> 00:52:51.325
I think, I think we have to end it there,

1146
00:52:51.705 --> 00:52:54.165
but that, that's just something I wanted to

1147
00:52:54.835 --> 00:52:56.015
add to what she was saying.

1148
00:52:56.475 --> 00:52:58.175
We can't lie to the person. Good point.

1149
00:52:58.175 --> 00:52:59.895
That's not loving them either. Yeah,

1150
00:52:59.955 --> 00:53:00.955
That's a good point.

1151
00:53:02.435 --> 00:53:04.175
So this, this is where you get to some of the,

1152
00:53:04.555 --> 00:53:06.975
the ethical decisions that they talk about in seminary.

1153
00:53:06.975 --> 00:53:07.975
They put this before you

1154
00:53:07.975 --> 00:53:12.375
and like, so would you, uh, Nazi Germany, you know,

1155
00:53:12.375 --> 00:53:13.615
these people are hiding below the,

1156
00:53:13.715 --> 00:53:16.795
the floor boards, soldiers come in.

1157
00:53:17.745 --> 00:53:20.945
Anybody here yes or no?

1158
00:53:22.965 --> 00:53:27.525
Don't. Yes. It's hard. And, and so yeah, it makes sense.

1159
00:53:27.585 --> 00:53:29.485
And maybe you say, I'm gonna trust the Lord.

1160
00:53:29.625 --> 00:53:32.565
Yes, they're here and then they don't see 'em somehow.

1161
00:53:32.815 --> 00:53:35.205
Right? Somehow God does his work. I don't know.

1162
00:53:35.585 --> 00:53:39.325
Uh, these are, this is why this is so hard. Yes, absolutely.

1163
00:53:39.425 --> 00:53:40.965
Tr another one. I think, well,

1164
00:53:41.645 --> 00:53:42.645
A couple of comments.

1165
00:53:42.665 --> 00:53:45.885
Uh, one just, we focused a lot on offending other people.

1166
00:53:46.505 --> 00:53:49.205
And I think the more important question, not

1167
00:53:49.205 --> 00:53:50.965
that we should say, we don't care if we offend people,

1168
00:53:51.505 --> 00:53:54.165
but to think about in this scenario of a group of people

1169
00:53:54.265 --> 00:53:56.365
who might be offended, it'd be, is

1170
00:53:56.365 --> 00:53:58.565
that gonna cause those other people to stumble, right?

1171
00:53:58.745 --> 00:54:01.925
Is, is my choice one way

1172
00:54:01.925 --> 00:54:04.205
or the other relative to a Christian liberty issue,

1173
00:54:04.205 --> 00:54:06.685
gonna cause another believer to stumble in their faith,

1174
00:54:07.525 --> 00:54:09.925
somebody who might be younger or less mature in their faith.

1175
00:54:09.925 --> 00:54:12.565
That's where I think that would be the litmus test for me,

1176
00:54:12.565 --> 00:54:13.845
more than are they gonna be offended

1177
00:54:13.945 --> 00:54:15.485
or not, not that we shouldn't consider it,

1178
00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:17.205
but we want to consider more what their spiritual

1179
00:54:17.205 --> 00:54:18.405
walk might be affected by that.

1180
00:54:19.395 --> 00:54:21.535
And, and I don't know,

1181
00:54:21.775 --> 00:54:23.775
I just a little bit different take on the,

1182
00:54:23.835 --> 00:54:24.935
on the pronoun issue.

1183
00:54:24.975 --> 00:54:26.855
I think it depends on the context of relationship.

1184
00:54:26.915 --> 00:54:28.575
And I'm really glad John said that.

1185
00:54:29.155 --> 00:54:31.815
Um, and I face that at Mike, I work as a physician.

1186
00:54:31.835 --> 00:54:33.535
And so I have patients that come in

1187
00:54:34.035 --> 00:54:35.655
and they choose how they, like,

1188
00:54:35.655 --> 00:54:37.455
they can write down how they would like.

1189
00:54:38.035 --> 00:54:39.775
And so that's someone

1190
00:54:39.835 --> 00:54:42.455
who I don't previously have a relationship with, right?

1191
00:54:42.455 --> 00:54:45.255
And so I can choose at that point to say, well, I'm gonna,

1192
00:54:45.975 --> 00:54:48.435
uh, go against your wishes and,

1193
00:54:48.435 --> 00:54:50.355
and immediately break that relationship.

1194
00:54:51.055 --> 00:54:54.475
Or I might step into that a little bit with

1195
00:54:54.475 --> 00:54:57.595
what they preferred in an effort to build a relationship.

1196
00:54:57.775 --> 00:54:59.475
And I had that example happen just today.

1197
00:55:00.055 --> 00:55:02.755
And so there are times of, if someone comes to me

1198
00:55:02.755 --> 00:55:04.555
and they say, I'm, I want you to call me

1199
00:55:04.555 --> 00:55:05.635
by a different pronoun now

1200
00:55:05.635 --> 00:55:07.235
because I I've known you for 30 years,

1201
00:55:07.255 --> 00:55:09.155
but I'm changing who I am.

1202
00:55:09.615 --> 00:55:12.455
That's a place to say, well, no. Right?

1203
00:55:13.115 --> 00:55:15.975
But if it's somebody who you're starting a relationship

1204
00:55:16.005 --> 00:55:19.335
with, there might be an avenue, I think, in an effort

1205
00:55:19.335 --> 00:55:21.735
to build that relationship to say, okay, that's, that's

1206
00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:23.095
where that person is right now.

1207
00:55:23.725 --> 00:55:25.535
Like the woman at the, well, I'm gonna love

1208
00:55:25.535 --> 00:55:27.975
that person first and then address their sin second.

1209
00:55:28.635 --> 00:55:30.385
There might be, there might be a space for that.

1210
00:55:30.805 --> 00:55:32.065
That's good. Okay.

1211
00:55:39.065 --> 00:55:42.765
Anyway, I, I hope I can put my thoughts together.

1212
00:55:42.865 --> 00:55:45.525
But I, you know, the, the Bible says anything

1213
00:55:45.525 --> 00:55:47.005
that's not a faith, it's sin.

1214
00:55:47.825 --> 00:55:49.805
And we've gotta start with the scriptures.

1215
00:55:50.625 --> 00:55:52.855
And there was a pastor

1216
00:55:52.965 --> 00:55:55.895
that I ran into years back,

1217
00:55:56.515 --> 00:55:59.095
and he showed me, you can read the Bible in 30 days.

1218
00:56:00.155 --> 00:56:02.865
And when you do that month

1219
00:56:02.865 --> 00:56:05.865
after month, he said, something will happen to you.

1220
00:56:05.965 --> 00:56:08.105
And I'm not gonna tell you, you call me what it is

1221
00:56:08.685 --> 00:56:12.385
and everything you do, scripture will come to your mind.

1222
00:56:13.415 --> 00:56:15.835
And I had a young man back home, I'm from Texas,

1223
00:56:16.575 --> 00:56:19.795
he was 25 years old, been in prison, just got out,

1224
00:56:20.095 --> 00:56:21.595
became a Christian in prison.

1225
00:56:21.935 --> 00:56:23.485
He had never heard the name Jesus.

1226
00:56:24.265 --> 00:56:26.085
And I was helping him work on his house.

1227
00:56:26.105 --> 00:56:27.525
And I was telling him about that.

1228
00:56:28.025 --> 00:56:30.805
He said, look, I thought I was going to impress him.

1229
00:56:30.805 --> 00:56:32.725
You know, about you can read the Bible in 30 days.

1230
00:56:32.925 --> 00:56:34.885
'cause everybody says that's impossible. It's not.

1231
00:56:35.305 --> 00:56:38.045
He said, let me tell you, when you're in prison in El Paso,

1232
00:56:38.045 --> 00:56:41.245
Texas, and you're scared for your life every day,

1233
00:56:41.305 --> 00:56:42.645
you read it in three days.

1234
00:56:43.465 --> 00:56:46.125
And he could tell me the differences in the translation.

1235
00:56:46.385 --> 00:56:49.125
And I think the whole thing is the more we put the word

1236
00:56:49.125 --> 00:56:50.565
of God in our life

1237
00:56:51.145 --> 00:56:54.405
and the spirit works through us, he's going to tell us what

1238
00:56:54.405 --> 00:56:55.645
to do in every situation.

1239
00:56:55.945 --> 00:56:58.005
Now, we're not perfect, and I'm definitely loud.

1240
00:56:58.105 --> 00:57:00.445
I'm glad y'all don't follow me and go watch me tomorrow.

1241
00:57:01.225 --> 00:57:03.845
But our answer is, God, it is not us.

1242
00:57:03.905 --> 00:57:05.205
And what other people think.

1243
00:57:05.905 --> 00:57:09.605
If there was an example of another preacher,

1244
00:57:10.025 --> 00:57:13.325
and he was talking about this guy had two dogs, a black one

1245
00:57:13.325 --> 00:57:16.145
and a white one, and he would take 'em to town every,

1246
00:57:16.355 --> 00:57:17.785
every week and fight 'em.

1247
00:57:18.165 --> 00:57:19.425
And everybody would bet.

1248
00:57:20.005 --> 00:57:23.025
And he had, and every week he'd be the last one

1249
00:57:23.045 --> 00:57:24.185
bet he always won.

1250
00:57:24.905 --> 00:57:26.205
And everybody finally asked him,

1251
00:57:26.225 --> 00:57:28.245
how come you always know who he win?

1252
00:57:28.305 --> 00:57:30.205
Who wins? And he said, it's

1253
00:57:30.205 --> 00:57:32.045
because it's the one I feed that week.

1254
00:57:32.265 --> 00:57:34.645
If we're not feeding ourself in the word of God,

1255
00:57:35.145 --> 00:57:36.405
the world is going to win.

1256
00:57:36.585 --> 00:57:40.045
And that's a daily struggle that we fall, that we do.

1257
00:57:40.425 --> 00:57:42.885
The only way God really speaks to us through his word,

1258
00:57:43.465 --> 00:57:47.525
and we depend on the Holy Spirit to lead our life, anything

1259
00:57:47.525 --> 00:57:50.965
of ourself is look at me.

1260
00:57:51.945 --> 00:57:54.245
You know, it's not good. And anyway, I hope I make sense.

1261
00:57:55.345 --> 00:57:58.165
Oh, that's good. That's good. Yeah. That's all over.

1262
00:57:58.705 --> 00:58:02.525
Uh, Proverbs, the way of wisdom is, is the words,

1263
00:58:03.505 --> 00:58:06.725
uh, even personifies the words in that.

1264
00:58:07.785 --> 00:58:09.685
All right. So I want to end with this.

1265
00:58:10.115 --> 00:58:13.045
This is a, a little snippet of an article

1266
00:58:13.045 --> 00:58:14.725
that I found today.

1267
00:58:15.705 --> 00:58:18.325
Uh, and it goes back to this conversation about our rights

1268
00:58:18.545 --> 00:58:22.285
and what we, what we can do, what we feel the rights

1269
00:58:22.285 --> 00:58:23.325
to do, all of that.

1270
00:58:23.345 --> 00:58:25.445
And we, we've talked about it in such a way

1271
00:58:25.445 --> 00:58:27.005
that it's kinda like, man, I gotta give up my

1272
00:58:27.005 --> 00:58:28.205
rights for the sake of others.

1273
00:58:28.265 --> 00:58:31.085
All of that, okay, listen to this.

1274
00:58:31.105 --> 00:58:34.285
It says, it's not that rights don't matter, they do.

1275
00:58:35.585 --> 00:58:39.165
But to follow Christ means to see allegiance to him

1276
00:58:39.305 --> 00:58:41.445
as more significant than any right?

1277
00:58:41.585 --> 00:58:45.325
We hold in this life with Christ

1278
00:58:45.385 --> 00:58:47.125
and his example ever before us.

1279
00:58:47.345 --> 00:58:50.165
Our view should be distinctly different from the rest

1280
00:58:50.345 --> 00:58:53.685
of human civilization because of the word

1281
00:58:53.985 --> 00:58:55.005
and the spirit in this.

1282
00:58:56.285 --> 00:59:00.525
A w Tozer once said, few sites are more depressing than that

1283
00:59:00.525 --> 00:59:04.445
of a professed Christian defending his supposed rights

1284
00:59:04.825 --> 00:59:08.085
and bitterly resisting any attempt to violate them.

1285
00:59:09.725 --> 00:59:13.255
Such a Christian has never accepted the way of the cross.

1286
00:59:16.665 --> 00:59:18.445
The stories of our persecuted brothers

1287
00:59:18.445 --> 00:59:20.885
and sisters around the world ought to remind us that we live

1288
00:59:20.885 --> 00:59:22.525
by grace, not by rights.

1289
00:59:24.515 --> 00:59:26.015
To be a Christian is to recognize

1290
00:59:26.015 --> 00:59:27.935
that the only thing we have a perfect right

1291
00:59:27.995 --> 00:59:29.655
to is the wrath of God.

1292
00:59:30.355 --> 00:59:32.855
And that's not a right. We want to insist on keeping

1293
00:59:35.275 --> 00:59:36.735
God is at work in the heart of his children,

1294
00:59:37.725 --> 00:59:41.655
replacing our preoccupation with hanging onto our positions

1295
00:59:41.655 --> 00:59:45.775
and rights with an aspiration to empty ourselves.

1296
00:59:47.115 --> 00:59:49.295
And when we aim to empty ourselves,

1297
00:59:50.625 --> 00:59:53.565
our ambition will reflect John the Baptist's desire

1298
00:59:53.625 --> 00:59:58.535
to see Jesus increase in the master's realm.

1299
00:59:58.715 --> 01:00:01.095
Its only right that it should be this way.

1300
01:00:04.985 --> 01:00:07.205
So God, we pray tonight in light of that,

1301
01:00:10.075 --> 01:00:11.965
that we would accept the way of the cross.

1302
01:00:16.695 --> 01:00:20.165
There are hard decisions we have to make some really

1303
01:00:21.165 --> 01:00:24.925
culturally relevant conversations that we've had tonight,

1304
01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:28.565
things that press very directly on us

1305
01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:31.885
and may even only increase in the future.

1306
01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:36.355
So may we learn from these persecuted brothers

1307
01:00:36.355 --> 01:00:39.395
and sisters that we, we live by your grace.

1308
01:00:40.335 --> 01:00:42.315
We are sustained by your word.

1309
01:00:43.905 --> 01:00:45.365
We are filled with your spirit.

1310
01:00:48.105 --> 01:00:51.325
And that wisdom is what we need, what we live by,

1311
01:00:51.395 --> 01:00:53.245
what we ask for.

1312
01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:56.205
That we would not be double-minded in all our ways,

1313
01:00:56.645 --> 01:01:01.255
unstable, but we would be instead filled with that wisdom

1314
01:01:01.515 --> 01:01:04.575
of your spirit, your word saturating our minds

1315
01:01:04.575 --> 01:01:08.015
that we would know the right thing to do by faith.

1316
01:01:12.665 --> 01:01:15.325
And I pray God for grace for one another

1317
01:01:16.865 --> 01:01:20.445
as we walk Lives that

1318
01:01:21.065 --> 01:01:25.805
are in such different context that our consciences are,

1319
01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:28.965
are affected by our history, by our experiences,

1320
01:01:29.225 --> 01:01:30.245
by our present.

1321
01:01:30.425 --> 01:01:32.485
All of these things affect us so differently.

1322
01:01:32.625 --> 01:01:35.005
So God, when we, when we see the big rocks,

1323
01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:39.445
God give us unity that is rock solid, unified,

1324
01:01:40.235 --> 01:01:44.995
aligned, but on the sand, Lord,

1325
01:01:44.995 --> 01:01:46.955
give us grace for one another.

1326
01:01:51.145 --> 01:01:53.685
May we seek ways to love

1327
01:01:54.635 --> 01:01:56.455
and to not put a stumbling block.

1328
01:02:00.615 --> 01:02:04.235
May we look for ways to support and to grow each each other.

1329
01:02:07.955 --> 01:02:10.735
But Lord, ultimately we, we want is you.

1330
01:02:14.165 --> 01:02:18.495
We want you God, And we need you.

1331
01:02:22.455 --> 01:02:25.715
So I pray that we would walk in a way that is worthy

1332
01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.635
of the calling to which we've been called

1333
01:02:29.475 --> 01:02:31.495
to maintain the unity of the spirit

1334
01:02:32.395 --> 01:02:37.255
and the bond of peace with all humility, gentleness,

1335
01:02:38.135 --> 01:02:42.965
patience, forbearance, knowing that we are on different

1336
01:02:44.105 --> 01:02:47.485
places along this pathway, towards christlikeness.

1337
01:02:49.145 --> 01:02:51.365
All of us are further along than we were

1338
01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:52.525
just a few years ago.

1339
01:02:54.175 --> 01:02:56.205
We've all grown and changed and developed.

1340
01:02:56.265 --> 01:02:58.825
And, and God, that's your work.

1341
01:03:00.245 --> 01:03:04.635
So give us grace for those who are where we once were.

1342
01:03:06.745 --> 01:03:08.795
Give us grace for those

1343
01:03:08.855 --> 01:03:11.315
who are further down the road than we are.

1344
01:03:14.645 --> 01:03:17.295
Because God, all we look forward

1345
01:03:17.295 --> 01:03:19.055
to is the day when you finish this work

1346
01:03:19.365 --> 01:03:21.575
that you promised you would finish, that you'll bring

1347
01:03:21.575 --> 01:03:23.495
to completion on the day of Jesus Christ.

1348
01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:25.335
This work you began in us.

1349
01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:30.585
So God, give us courage to stand where we need

1350
01:03:30.585 --> 01:03:35.225
to give us hope when we are hit with hard things.

1351
01:03:37.245 --> 01:03:40.675
I pray that we be the body of Christ together to support

1352
01:03:40.735 --> 01:03:41.915
and encourage and lift up

1353
01:03:41.935 --> 01:03:45.635
and stand with as we have to make hard decisions, as we have

1354
01:03:45.635 --> 01:03:47.475
to stand against the current of the world.

1355
01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:52.995
That this would be a fortress, a safe place.

1356
01:03:53.005 --> 01:03:55.155
These people would be our family.

1357
01:03:58.045 --> 01:04:00.985
Family that lasts forever with you as our father,

1358
01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:02.625
Christ as our brother.

1359
01:04:04.885 --> 01:04:07.355
Thank you God for tonight. Thank you for the series.

1360
01:04:07.655 --> 01:04:09.715
God, what a gift it's been to my soul

1361
01:04:09.815 --> 01:04:11.675
and to our pray to our church.

1362
01:04:12.695 --> 01:04:15.435
Uh, thank you that you've brought us this far

1363
01:04:15.655 --> 01:04:18.515
and I pray you continue to move us forward for your glory.

1364
01:04:18.515 --> 01:04:21.675
In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.

1365
01:04:22.685 --> 01:04:25.675
Thank You'all, love you more than you know.

1366
01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:27.835
Couple resources here.

1367
01:04:27.835 --> 01:04:30.795
Come ask questions, but uh, otherwise, see you Sunday.

1368
01:04:31.015 --> 01:04:31.555
We are sent.
