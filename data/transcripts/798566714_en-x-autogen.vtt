1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
For the grace of God offers salvation to

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.900
all people teaching us to live Godly

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.300
lives.

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.200
Jesus gave himself for us to redeem us and

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.900
to purify for himself a people

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.500
that are his very own.

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.400
Father we come to you humbly today.

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.000
What is we?

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.500
As we rush through life so much. We never slow

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.900
down and

11
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.000
and just rest in you and

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.000
deal with

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.800
our own hearts

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.200
So God, we want to start this time.

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.000
Thanking you.

16
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.000
this is not something that we're

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.200
we're coming to check a box or fill out

18
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.700
our Sunday with some activity. It's

19
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.200
it's because you are already here and we are coming to meet with

20
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.300
you.

21
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.500
We don't have to invite you here. We don't have to give you permission.

22
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.500
But God starts with us.

23
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.300
in our own hearts

24
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600
bringing us to where you want us to be God break

25
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.300
down walls if there's something that we are.

26
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.500
Holding so tightly to God break

27
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.400
it down that we could see you today and be good soil in

28
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.600
our own Hearts to receive what you have for us.

29
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.300
God you've been stirring this.

30
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.300
For a while. I thank you for that. I thank

31
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.800
you for this time today.

32
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.600
Do your work?

33
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.100
And we give this to you. I pray every one of us in this room.

34
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.500
Anyone watching would give this moment to you

35
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.300
and say yours.

36
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.300
God what a gift. It's been already we pray now

37
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.000
as we move forward we see you for

38
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.500
who you are.

39
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800
in Jesus name

40
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.800
I know it. It actually is Super Bowl Sunday today,

41
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.500
but it certainly feels like it to me in

42
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.900
here as well.

43
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.100
Like I pray there's been this stirring in my soul

44
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.600
all week.

45
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.100
For what? He's

46
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.300
Doing I'm seeing it happen all over. I

47
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.100
don't know if you've heard anything about what's happening at Asbury in Kentucky, but

48
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.100
The season back in the 70s of the Jesus

49
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.000
movement started from Asbury with the weeks long

50
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.700
Revival Awakening session. It's happening again.

51
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.400
It's the movie comes out about that one. It's happening even

52
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.800
right now.

53
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.900
And then we saw baptisms today and

54
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.000
last week and we see.

55
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.000
last Sunday just the taste of God's glory and

56
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.300
many ways and

57
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.100
then we come to this passage today. Like one of

58
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.300
the highest peaks of the entire Bible is right what we're gonna study today

59
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.300
just pure gospel pure good news, and then how we

60
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.600
are to respond to it. Like I I am

61
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.200
it's been just geared up all week for this.

62
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.300
For what God wants to do and so if you're not there already turn

63
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.000
with me to Titus Chapter 2 will be in

64
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.300
verses 11 through 15 today.

65
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.300
No, true movement of God happens apart from

66
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.200
his word. And so we stay tightly to that as we'll say again

67
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.400
later, but Titus 2 11 through 15.

68
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.600
We're in a sermon series through the book of Titus called his very own

69
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.400
where we're looking at the church being his and

70
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.700
so we ordered accordingly.

71
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.500
But then also us individually.

72
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.000
or his

73
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.400
so we should order our lives accordingly.

74
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.800
like that

75
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.400
So we're going to start this a little bit out of order

76
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.400
today tied us to verse 15 first. You'll

77
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.800
see why.

78
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.300
Remember Paul put Titus here on Crete and Titus

79
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.900
in a tough spot.

80
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.700
There and doing Ministry and so Paul speaks

81
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.700
directly to Titus in verse 15 says declare these

82
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.000
things.

83
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.700
Exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard

84
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.900
you.

85
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.100
So what things is he saying to Titus to do

86
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.500
this with? Well, it is all of chapter 2 what he

87
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.800
just said in verse 1 this lifestyle that Accords

88
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.400
with sound Doctrine it matches what God says, you

89
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.000
should live like teach that boldly try

90
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.100
to stand confidently on the

91
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.900
fact that any rebuke or exhortation or truth

92
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.300
claim Titus. You can know that that's

93
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.800
come and directly from God.

94
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.600
Listen, that's the same thing today.

95
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.300
See any Authority that I have to stand up here and

96
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.800
say anything about anything any any Authority

97
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.500
or CG leader has to say what they're

98
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.300
saying or any Authority or Bible study teacher has to say what

99
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.100
they're saying. It comes from the word of God.

100
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.300
It's the only place this truly we can't

101
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.700
make up stuff and have any Authority. This is where we land and

102
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.200
so must be anchored to

103
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.000
God's word to have any sense of authority.

104
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.000
It's from God and here's why.

105
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.400
Here's why we cannot get distracted away

106
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.000
from the pure gospel.

107
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.300
Because it's not any idea that I or anyone else

108
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.700
can come up with that change is everything. It's actually

109
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.800
God's grace that changes everything.

110
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.700
That's that's the main point of this whole thing today.

111
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.700
That God's grace is the foundation God's grace

112
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.300
is what changes everything. It's not my ideas or

113
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.700
anybody else's ideas. It's God in his grace.

114
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.500
It's actually what we see start this verse 11.

115
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.800
Verse 11 starts with the word four f-o-r and

116
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.500
that word means because it links

117
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.300
back to what he just said remember in verses 1 through 10. Here's

118
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.700
how you're supposed to live. Men women Bond servants Titus.

119
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.300
Here's how you should live verse 11

120
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.500
starts with because

121
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.200
here's what he's about to say in other words. What he's about to

122
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.300
say is the reason and the way we're even

123
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.900
able to do what he just said to do.

124
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.200
So this word links us to what he says next. What does

125
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.200
he say for the grace of God has appeared?

126
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.000
Live like this because God's grace

127
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.300
showed up.

128
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.100
Now, let's be clear that Grace is not

129
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.100
merely an idea.

130
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.600
That Grace is a person.

131
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.100
Because John 1 says that Jesus the

132
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.100
word became flesh dwelt Among

133
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.700
Us full of grace and truth.

134
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.200
So it wasn't just the idea of Grace showed up. It was

135
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.500
Jesus showed up and him in Grace gave

136
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.300
them power to change.

137
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.200
And so again God's grace changes everything but it's not just Grace, it's

138
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.500
Jesus. He does the work he changes everything.

139
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.200
But before we go any further, we need to define grace because we all

140
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.900
need to be on the same page here because there's a whole lot of definitions and

141
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.600
understandings of Grace. What does grace actually

142
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.900
mean? Well Grace is defined like this.

143
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.200
The undeserved and unearned favor and love of

144
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.400
God.

145
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.400
undeserved unearned favor and love of God

146
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.100
It's a gift.

147
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.100
I found this definition. Maybe this illustration will help.

148
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.600
When a person Works an eight-hour day and receives a

149
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.300
day's pay for his time, that's a

150
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.000
wage.

151
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.200
When a person completes competes with an opponent and

152
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.500
receives a trophy for his performance, that is a

153
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:18.900
prize.

154
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.500
When a person receives appropriate recognition for his long

155
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.700
service or high achievements, that is an award.

156
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.500
But when a person is not capable of earning a wage

157
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.000
can win no prize and deserves No

158
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.400
Award yet receive such a

159
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.100
gift anyway.

160
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.000
That's a good picture of God's unmerited favor.

161
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.600
That is what we mean when we talk about the grace of God.

162
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.200
But just think about that man, don't we?

163
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.600
Default into those first few options really quickly,

164
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:55.800
right?

165
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.800
Like the wage and the prize and like we we default

166
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.300
into that so quickly where we think

167
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.600
like, you know, I got to earn God's love somehow or or

168
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.500
we need to to try to beat out other people. So we

169
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.100
get up the ladder or or somehow. I

170
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.500
deserve God's love.

171
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.200
No.

172
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.300
Grace is a gift.

173
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.400
And how does that gift?

174
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.200
change everything

175
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.200
look at verses 11 through 14. This is how that

176
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.900
Grace in Jesus changes everything.

177
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.000
For the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation

178
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.400
for all people training us

179
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.100
to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions and

180
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.700
to live self-controlled upright and godly

181
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.200
lives in this present age.

182
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.500
Waiting for our blessed hope the appearing of

183
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.100
the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ who gave

184
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.500
himself for us to redeem us

185
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.200
from all lawlessness and to purify for

186
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.800
himself a people for his own possession who

187
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.600
are zealous for good works.

188
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.700
Now you see there's so much packed into those few

189
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.100
verses.

190
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.100
Just full of gospel.

191
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.700
but notice what it specifically says Jesus coming

192
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.000
did

193
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.300
The grace of God Jesus appeared. What did

194
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.700
he come to do first? He saves us.

195
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.300
He came to save us.

196
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.900
The grace of God has appeared bringing salvation for

197
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.600
all people.

198
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.700
now at first glance

199
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.900
that sounds Universalist, right?

200
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.200
That all people are going to be saved. He came to

201
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.400
save everybody. So everybody's going to make it in but that can't be right

202
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.400
because that goes against so many other scriptures. Say

203
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.100
the opposite.

204
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.100
So what does this mean?

205
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.300
Well, it means the first that jesus' life death and Resurrection is the

206
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.700
means by which people can be saved that

207
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.300
without him. There is no salvation Acts 4:12

208
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:12.600
says

209
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.500
so he is the way to salvation but also his life

210
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.200
death and Resurrection is effective for all

211
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.500
who will be saved.

212
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.000
He will save people.

213
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:24.700
He's able.

214
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.200
But there's also this emphasis Paul is giving here that

215
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.700
this salvation was not merely for the Jews.

216
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.700
It was actually for all people groups.

217
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.300
Even remember Romans 1:16. Paul says I'm not ashamed of

218
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.400
the Gospel. It's the power of God for the Salvation of those who believe

219
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.800
First for the Jew but also for the Gentile.

220
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.300
It's for all people. This gospel is not reserved for

221
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.400
one group, but you think about that verse

222
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.000
what's the kicker in that verse the kickers belief?

223
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.400
Belief, that's how a person responds to

224
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.000
Jesus. That is what means salvation or

225
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.200
not.

226
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.700
Ephesians 2 says that by Grace you've been saved through

227
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.300
faith.

228
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.400
And even this is not your own doing it's a gift of God not

229
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.700
a result of work so that no one may boast. So even belief in

230
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.300
faith is still not your work. It's God's

231
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.000
gift.

232
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.500
You might remember it this way that means you are a receiver

233
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.900
of God's grace. Not an

234
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.300
achiever of God's grace.

235
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.100
Nothing. It's a gift. There's nothing in you.

236
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.000
It's simply his.

237
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.700
unmerited favor

238
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.300
But all that begs the question in a group this size.

239
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.300
Have you received that gift?

240
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.200
Have you received his grace? Do you

241
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.300
believe in your heart?

242
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.300
That Jesus died for your sins and God raised him from

243
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:04.700
the dead.

244
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.300
And do you confess with your mouth and with your life that

245
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.400
Jesus is your lord and your savior?

246
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.200
If you do that means you will be

247
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.900
saved Romans 10 says

248
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.300
like you have been changed.

249
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.500
But don't miss this.

250
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.700
You can grow up in church your entire life.

251
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.200
You can even be a decent human being.

252
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.400
And not have received this gracious salvation of

253
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:37.700
Jesus.

254
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.400
When Jesus says it in Matthew chapter 7 he's saying

255
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.200
at the very end of time. There's going to be people who walk up to him and say

256
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.600
Lord.

257
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.700
Did we not do amazing things in your name? Did we not look religious?

258
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.400
Did we not live a life that sure seemed like we

259
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.000
were Christians and he's gonna say away from

260
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.000
me. I never knew you.

261
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.300
Like you can even be very religious.

262
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.300
And not be transformed by

263
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:07.700
the Lord.

264
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.200
So, do you know him?

265
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.700
Do you know this Jesus as your

266
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.000
king and as your savior?

267
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.000
Or maybe the better question is does he know you?

268
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.400
Where you have received this Redemption verse

269
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.300
14 says Redemption from all lawlessness. Have

270
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.800
you been redeemed?

271
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.200
and if not

272
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.500
See who he is today turn from your sin and

273
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.900
yourself and turn to him give your life to him

274
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.500
because he changes everything.

275
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:48.800
He makes you new.

276
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.700
But here's what we miss communicate about salvation so

277
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.000
often.

278
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.500
What will often talk about it being is is

279
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.200
merely fire Insurance to keep you out of hell when you die.

280
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.400
That salvation is merely about eternity.

281
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.300
Like do you know where you're going to go when you die, right? That's

282
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.100
all that it's about. But the point of this for the grace of

283
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.300
God has appeared bringing salvation for all people. Yes, but look

284
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.700
at the next words in verse 12. He says training us.

285
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.700
Not just about eternity. He's training us

286
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.400
that means in daily life.

287
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.600
He trains us.

288
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.500
So he saves us.

289
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.600
And he trains us.

290
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.000
And just think a good father.

291
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.600
Doesn't have a child and then says to them you're on

292
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:45.800
your own.

293
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.400
Like I hope you figured out kid. No a good

294
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.300
father trains his children how to live

295
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.700
a Godly life.

296
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.800
It's what God does with us but notice

297
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.300
in verse 12. There's a couple different ways that God

298
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:03.900
trains us.

299
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.500
verse 12 training us

300
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.800
to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions

301
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.900
and to live self-controlled upright

302
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.000
and godly lives in the present age.

303
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.000
So there's two ways he trains us it says.

304
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.400
First he trains Us by subtraction.

305
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.200
A middle schoolers. We're not going to do a lot of math today, but there

306
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.900
is subtraction. In addition today. Just know that's coming.

307
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.200
But it says he trains us to renounce

308
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.300
that's to remove to give

309
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.900
up to take out of something to renounce

310
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.700
what ungodliness and worldly passion.

311
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.700
Is there anything that goes against God's standard God's ways

312
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.500
anything that that our desires are misaligned

313
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.200
or misdirected. Those are

314
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.300
sinful.

315
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.500
He says we need to subtract those things because

316
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.500
what happens in God's grace clearly God's grace

317
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.900
appeared training us. He leads us

318
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.300
to refuse those things to begin

319
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.200
to deny the power that they have in our

320
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.600
lives.

321
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.700
We sang it earlier but to do what first Thessalonians 1:9 puts

322
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.000
it to turn from Idols to serve

323
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.500
the living and true God.

324
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.500
I love how Ray ortland put this this process. He described

325
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.300
it where he said that our hearts are like

326
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:33.900
a boardroom.

327
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.300
So imagine a boardroom and you know, the Executive Suite of

328
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.500
some office space and there's a big big long table

329
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.100
in the middle and big leather chairs around it. You got water

330
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.500
bottles in the middle got a big whiteboard over here, right the boardroom where

331
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.800
the decisions are made. That's your heart.

332
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.500
And there's this committee that sits around that table.

333
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.300
A committee of selfs. You might say

334
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.600
And it's the social self. This is

335
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.400
all in your heart the social self the private self the

336
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.600
work self the sexual self the recreational

337
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.600
self the religious self and all kinds

338
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.500
of others, right?

339
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.300
And that Committee of selves is in your heart

340
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.700
is constantly debating and arguing and voting

341
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.400
rarely coming to a wholehearted unanimous

342
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.900
decision, right?

343
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.700
You know what? I'm talking about, you feel that it's just like constant. That's

344
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.600
why we're so unfocused. We're so hesitant. We're

345
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.300
wishy-washy on stuff. We're unfree in

346
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:33.900
the way. We live.

347
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.500
Now that kind of person.

348
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.000
Can accept Jesus let's just

349
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.400
use that phrase can accept Jesus one of two ways.

350
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.200
One way is to invite Jesus onto the committee.

351
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.600
To give him one vote.

352
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:53.900
On the committee.

353
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.500
But then all he becomes is just one more voice in

354
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.400
the chaos of the committee.

355
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.400
And he might get drowned out by whichever one is talking the

356
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.600
loudest at that moment.

357
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:09.600
Okay.

358
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.800
So here's the other way to accept Jesus.

359
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.200
To say this to him.

360
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.800
Jesus my life is not working.

361
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.500
This is not working. So please come

362
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.200
in and fire my committee every single one

363
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:28.500
of them.

364
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.800
Right to say invite him in and say I'm handing

365
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.400
myself over to you. This whole thing

366
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.400
is your responsibility now, I give my life to

367
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.200
you. You make all the decisions.

368
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.900
See, that's what we mean when we talk about about salvation around

369
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.400
here no matter what you heard before no matter

370
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.100
what I heard when I was growing up when we talk about getting saved. It's

371
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.400
not about adding Jesus to

372
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:56.800
your life.

373
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.200
It's it's making an acknowledging the

374
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.400
fact that Jesus is the Lord and then subtracting all

375
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.600
the false gods from your life as well.

376
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.300
So many professing Christians have never let go of

377
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.400
their lives to Jesus.

378
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.400
We've merely added him in as one option as one voice

379
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.100
on our committee and saying maybe he's going

380
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:24.800
to win out this time.

381
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.300
Or we put him as one of the the tools we have on

382
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.300
the shelf, and we pull them down when we need him, but the rest

383
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.700
of our life we're in charge.

384
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.400
You can say all the religious language you want

385
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.500
about Jesus being Savior and Lord if

386
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.000
he is not actually Lord of all,

387
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.900
he's not Lord at all.

388
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.500
So open your hands.

389
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.600
Give up control.

390
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.200
Stop trying to to debate and argue. Just

391
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.300
give him your life because when you open your hands up,

392
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.100
let him remove all the idols in your

393
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.400
life. If you if you're like this you can't do that.

394
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.300
He needs this so he can subtract.

395
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.800
as he needs to

396
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.100
thankfully doesn't only subtract.

397
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.400
It also said in Grace he also trains Us by

398
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.100
addition.

399
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.200
So he trained us to renounce.

400
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.800
Sinful selfish ways,

401
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.700
but then he also trains us verse 12 to

402
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.400
live self-controlled upright Godly

403
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:42.700
lives.

404
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.700
As we open our hands and submit to him. He trains us

405
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.500
to produce an uprightness in

406
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.300
us where we live like he wants us to his

407
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.400
just righteous standard.

408
00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.200
That he gives us what we said the last few weeks new self-control

409
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.300
that it's his control in us

410
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.500
and we've submitted to him and he gives us this new

411
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.700
way of living what he says here a Godly

412
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.300
life.

413
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.300
Where you live more like Jesus lived while he

414
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.800
was on the earth what he wants you to live like in every

415
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.600
area of life.

416
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.700
Godliness seeps down into everything marriage

417
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.200
business Civic responsibilities finances

418
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.200
neighbors. We're going to talk a lot more about

419
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:29.900
that next week.

420
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.400
what this looks like in daily life, but

421
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.500
but again the point here today.

422
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.600
Is that salvation is not only about what happens

423
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.400
after you die.

424
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.800
He brings salvation, but it's not only about that.

425
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.100
He says the gospel is also good news for this

426
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.200
present age verse 12 said

427
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.300
for today God's grace changes everything today, too.

428
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.100
But here's the problem with that present age.

429
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.000
It's a mess it.

430
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.300
We talk about it being transformed but it's it's broken.

431
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.500
Jesus said it in John 16:33 in this world. You

432
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.600
will have tribulation.

433
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.400
So what's he talking about? Like what kind of tribulation Jesus

434
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.600
well, he's talking about pain in your life first from just

435
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.500
life in general from things. You can't control.

436
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.100
You have pain in life from cancer from early death

437
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.700
of a friend or storms or

438
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.400
floods.

439
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.200
Terrorists earthquakes we saw this week.

440
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.900
It's just pain from life.

441
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.300
You had nothing to do with it.

442
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.600
But there's also pain.

443
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.700
from your own sins consequences

444
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.700
where you are forgiven, eternally,

445
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.200
but you might have to pay the

446
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:03.700
price here.

447
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.100
You might have to go to jail. You might have to rebuild trust with

448
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.400
your kids. You might have like you can see there's there's ways that

449
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.100
you're going to have to count that as part of

450
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.400
the deal.

451
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.800
From your own decision your own choice.

452
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.600
But there's also pain that comes from persecution many

453
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.400
of our brothers and sisters around the world right now are experiencing that

454
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.300
we may someday.

455
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.000
There's pain in life. There's tribulation.

456
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.800
And so here's another way that God's

457
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.100
grace changes. Everything is that he

458
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.400
sustains us while we wait for the

459
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.400
Blessed. Hope verse 13 says of his second appearing.

460
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.100
He saves us he trains us and he sustains us

461
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.600
until that day comes.

462
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.400
And listen if the world needs anything right now, it could use a

463
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.800
dose of Hope, right?

464
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.500
I mean so much misery.

465
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.200
There's so much pain and depression and

466
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.300
and woe is me mentality. There's

467
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.200
all kinds of hopelessness people watch the

468
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.400
news and have this despair everything. Just getting worse. It's so

469
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:16.600
bad.

470
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.500
Don't miss out on what the grace of God brings.

471
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.000
Did you see it?

472
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.900
In Titus 2 right his first appearing the grace of God appeared

473
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.600
past tense as Jesus coming the first time he

474
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.600
brought what salvation training he

475
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.500
brought all these things Titus to talks about.

476
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.600
But then it's pointing us to a second appearing.

477
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.600
That his second appearing at the end will consummate the

478
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.900
hope that we have had all along.

479
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.300
But we misunderstand hope too.

480
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.600
We need to get the definition of Grace. What about hope?

481
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.900
See, we don't just hope something will happen.

482
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.500
We hope because we know something will happen.

483
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.800
But you see the difference there.

484
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.500
That we don't just hope man. I hope we win the game tonight. Like

485
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.600
that's that's a hope that you don't know. This is a hope because

486
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.400
we already know it's going to happen.

487
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.300
It's a whole different ballgame.

488
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.600
See listen, our hope is not in circumstances improving because they

489
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:21.900
might not

490
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.400
Our Hope cannot be in the government turning back to God because it

491
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.000
probably won't

492
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.200
Our hope is not in being wealthy and successful because we

493
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.500
might not ever be that our hope is in the fact that

494
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.600
our great God and savior is coming back one day

495
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.300
to remake this whole thing into a perfect

496
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.100
world forever.

497
00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.400
That's our hope that is already settled that

498
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.000
there's a new heavens and new earth coming where we're going to

499
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.500
live with him forever. And that's guaranteed because he resurrected on

500
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.000
the third day.

501
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.600
It's a hope that First Peter 1 describes as a

502
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600
Living Hope.

503
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.200
What one of our values at church life-giving hope this is

504
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.900
where this comes from First Peter 1 3 through 9 blessed be

505
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.000
the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Who according

506
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.500
to his great Mercy has caused

507
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.100
us to be born again to a Living Hope.

508
00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.300
Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

509
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.100
Two an inheritance that is imperishable undefiled

510
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.300
unfading kept in heaven for

511
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:27.500
you.

512
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.500
Who by God's power are being guarded through

513
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.200
faith for a Salvation ready to be revealed in

514
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:34.700
the last time.

515
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.000
in this you rejoice

516
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.100
though now for a little while you have been grieved by

517
00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.200
various trials.

518
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.300
So that the tested genuineness of your faith more precious

519
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.100
than gold that perishes those tested by

520
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:50.300
fire.

521
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.300
That Faith may be found to result in praise and

522
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.900
glory and honor at the Revelation the second appearing

523
00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.500
of Jesus Christ.

524
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.400
Though you have not seen him. This is talking to us though.

525
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.800
You've not seen him you love him.

526
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.800
Though you do not now see him you believe in him

527
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.800
and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible filled

528
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.300
with Glory obtaining the outcome of

529
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.400
your faith the salvation of your souls.

530
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.800
This is waiting that is filled

531
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.400
with hope filled with

532
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.800
worship filled with joy, even

533
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.400
through the tears of grief from living in

534
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.300
a fallen world. This is saying man. There's something better coming.

535
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.800
And I know it's coming. I know it's going to happen.

536
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.400
Because we can take our notice Jesus even though

537
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.600
he said in John 16, we have trouble in the world in the

538
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.300
same breath. He said yes, but you can have peace in this

539
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:48.900
same world.

540
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.100
Remember why?

541
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.300
Because I have overcome this

542
00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:55.600
world.

543
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.100
Yeah, it's gonna be hard. Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of tears, but you can

544
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.700
have peace in this because I already beat it all.

545
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.800
And I'm coming back one day.

546
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.800
see listened that is how

547
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.500
That that hope is how a young Widow and

548
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:14.700
her children.

549
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.300
can face the hardest moment of their

550
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.600
life the death of her husband their father and face

551
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:22.800
it with

552
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.100
courage face it with joy

553
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.400
Through the tears through the loneliness absolutely that's there,

554
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.500
but they can see a future in God's word.

555
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.300
They can see a future in prayer in community. They can

556
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.600
see a future another Believers through reflecting on this gospel

557
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.200
message. And that change is not only the fact

558
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.600
that they're going to be with him someday the fact that that changes today.

559
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.700
and listen, that is the kind of Life Giving

560
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.400
hope that this is talking about

561
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.100
and I'll tell you right now.

562
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.100
There is nothing in my life that has ever been building my faith like that

563
00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.300
watching that happen.

564
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.100
It has filled my soul with such joy and in depth

565
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.200
watching that.

566
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.400
This is Hope.

567
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.400
that the world needs

568
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.600
but what do we do until that day?

569
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.200
What do we do until Jesus returns? I mean, he's

570
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.200
he's promised. Yes. He's coming back. We know it's sure but what do we

571
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:39.700
do until then?

572
00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.800
Do we just sit on the couch? Lazil eating popcorn watching

573
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.900
the world burn around us. Is that what we're supposed to do?

574
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.000
Like we're gonna get out of this thing pretty soon. So look forward to

575
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.000
that day. You guys are in trouble like no now, that's not right.

576
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:56.700
What do we do?

577
00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.400
God's grace changes everything eternally. Yes, but notice in

578
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.700
verse 14. He did all of this to purify for

579
00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.600
himself a people for his own possession

580
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.500
who are zealous for good works.

581
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.100
You ever seen your dog the way they react when you say let's

582
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:14.700
go for a walk.

583
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.400
Start shaking God can't do anything but

584
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.700
just focus so much on that excited. Zealous is

585
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:22.900
the word.

586
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.600
A people for his own possession who are zealous for

587
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.200
good works.

588
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.400
To be like that for what he wants

589
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:34.900
us to do.

590
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.600
But we must be it says in verse 14 purified. So

591
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.800
so he saves us he trains us he sustains

592
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.700
us and he purifies us every

593
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.800
day now until that day comes

594
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.200
he is refining purifying now. We're

595
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.600
talking a lot more about good works next week in chapter 3 what all

596
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.400
that means but now no what he's talking about here is zealous

597
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.700
for those things are the things that you do to live

598
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.400
like Jesus.

599
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.200
Like what would Jesus do that whole bracelet thing? Right?

600
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.000
What would he do? How would he be? How would he live?

601
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.700
That's what we saw earlier uprightness godliness with an

602
00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.800
eye to Eternity. It's living like he would.

603
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.100
Second Peter 3 says that what sort of people ought

604
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.200
you to be in lives of Holiness and godliness today waiting for

605
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.700
and hastening the coming of the day of God meaning something changes today

606
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.300
as you wait.

607
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.800
I want to take you in a little bit of a journey here. This is so important.

608
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.300
Because that word purifying verse 14 means to cleanse we

609
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.800
sing about it earlier that we were in our sin Crimson

610
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.500
stained we could do nothing about it. But but the

611
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.400
cleansing blood of Jesus washed us

612
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.100
made us white as snow.

613
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.700
And I want you to remember something that that's

614
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.400
how you are spiritually right now

615
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.700
before the Throne of God.

616
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.300
Not you earning that.

617
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.900
But if you are in Jesus who is perfect

618
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.300
who stands righteous, who is

619
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.500
your Advocate your substitute if you're in him

620
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.500
you're standing there pure.

621
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.800
That's the the reality of the Redemption

622
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.800
of the blood of Jesus that he has made us. Holy

623
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.500
in him that we are his very own.

624
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.900
I want you to remember that Christian because that is your identity now.

625
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.600
The world says so much else the enemy will throw something

626
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.200
in your mind and say no. No, that's not you. Look at what you did

627
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.700
yesterday. Look at what you did 10 years ago. You're not clean. You're

628
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.800
not pure God doesn't love you.

629
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.000
this

630
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.300
Is who you are Christian?

631
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.500
Second Peter 1 3 and 4 his divine power has granted to

632
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.900
us all things that pertain to life and godliness through

633
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.300
the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and

634
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.700
Excellence by which Jesus he has granted to

635
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.600
us his precious and very great promises. So

636
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.600
that through them you may become partakers of

637
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.100
the divine nature.

638
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.500
Through those things you are now partakers of

639
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.700
the divine nature having escaped from the

640
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.300
corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.

641
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.500
Did you see those are all past tense indicatives? Those are

642
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.600
all things that have already happened?

643
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.500
He called you. He saved you he made you different.

644
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.500
He made you a partaker you've escaped from

645
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.500
right? That's all past tense.

646
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.600
That means that's who you already are. Don't forget.

647
00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.600
That's who you are.

648
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:59.000
Starts there. It's only there and so that definition

649
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.400
means we must then move

650
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.400
forward from that. We don't start anywhere else we start

651
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.400
there. That's who we are the process we're talking about. Now. This

652
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.400
purification is talking about big word

653
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.300
sanctification.

654
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.900
It's how he has made us something eternally

655
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.000
and one day we'll be back there glorified with him bodily. But

656
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.400
for now, he's making us more

657
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.200
like we already are.

658
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.100
See what I mean by that we're already there.

659
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.100
It's spiritually we are standing there pure 100%

660
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.500
Now he's making us more into that every day

661
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.600
second Peter 1 continues for this very reason.

662
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.200
Meaning because God's done all of that.

663
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.800
make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue virtue

664
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.600
with knowledge knowledge with self-control self-control with

665
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.300
steadfastness steadfasted with godliness godliness with

666
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.300
brotherly affection brotherly affection with love all

667
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.900
of these daily character qualities, see that

668
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.900
For if these qualities are yours and are increasing.

669
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.400
They keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in

670
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.900
the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

671
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.600
What he's saying there?

672
00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.300
You've already been set free so live as

673
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.300
if you are free.

674
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.700
You're already free from the corruption of your sinful nature.

675
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.500
Now, it's still we get it the flesh. There's all that but

676
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.400
but effectively live it out that you

677
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.000
already are.

678
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.900
Just live out who you already are in Christ.

679
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.500
Just think about it for a

680
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.200
freed prisoner.

681
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.800
To go back into the jail cell and chain themselves

682
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.600
back up. That's pretty silly, isn't it?

683
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.500
It's called spiritual amnesia.

684
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.300
You forget what you've been freed from.

685
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.700
That's what verse 9 even says as he continues for

686
00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.600
whoever lacks. These qualities is so nearsighted. He's

687
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.000
blind having forgotten that he was cleansed

688
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.700
from his former sins.

689
00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.600
You've been freed.

690
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.200
Don't go back and chain yourself up over it.

691
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.100
But here's the key.

692
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.800
Here's the key remembering.

693
00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.200
And Awakening to this eternity-changing

694
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.500
life-changing grace of God in Jesus.

695
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.700
That's the only way you will consistently make

696
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.200
progress in your spiritual life.

697
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.300
remembering

698
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.300
and Awakening to the grace of

699
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.700
God is the only way you're going to make progress in

700
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.500
your spiritual life.

701
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.300
Not by trying harder not by doing more

702
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.300
things or going to church more doing this more that more. It's

703
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.200
not about that. We must consistently Delight in

704
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.700
and be thrilled by this great good

705
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.600
news of Jesus.

706
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.700
And that's why you get the constant drumbeat of it here and like

707
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.100
what if you've been here for any length of time, you're like man, they

708
00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.500
say the same thing over and over and over again. Yeah, that's why.

709
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.900
Because this is our source.

710
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.800
This is our treasure the gospel. Jesus life.

711
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.100
Death and Resurrection is our treasure.

712
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.200
And here's what it does. It keeps us two ways. It

713
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.600
keeps us from being downcast over our sin.

714
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.800
And it keeps us from being arrogant over our salvation.

715
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.100
Because if it's Grace remember Grace is a gift

716
00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.300
if it's Grace, then you didn't deserve it. So don't

717
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.100
get arrogant about it.

718
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.800
And if it's Grace that's undeserved. It means that that

719
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.100
is covered.

720
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.100
Whatever. That was whatever that is, it's covered.

721
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.200
Think first John 3:1.

722
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.500
see what kind of love

723
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.900
father has given to us that we

724
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.600
should be called children of God.

725
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:11.900
And so we are.

726
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.800
That changes everything right?

727
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.300
That God would choose to make

728
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.200
us his children.

729
00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.200
stunning

730
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.100
So what is our response to that look like?

731
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.900
Our response should not immediately. Go back to those first couple options instead

732
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.400
of Grace. It should not merely be towards well effort and

733
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.200
Purity and Holiness and obedience. Like I got to

734
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.800
try harder I got to do this more. No, our Pursuit should be toward

735
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.000
Christ himself.

736
00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:52.400
It should be towards him. He is the source he is

737
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.000
Grace.

738
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.500
He is the one we should pursue because listen, there

739
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:01.000
is no power toward change as powerful

740
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.700
as an awe and an affection

741
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.900
for the king of kings.

742
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.100
There's nothing that will compare to that kind of

743
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:09.700
power.

744
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.200
I could use so many examples here and this really does relate to every

745
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.200
single area of Our Lives Temptation wise, but I want to pick one. That's

746
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.100
very tangibly relevant.

747
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.400
Here's an example if if we want our kids to remain

748
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.100
sexually pure until marriage.

749
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.700
It's not enough to Simply. Tell them the consequences

750
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.100
if they don't.

751
00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:38.700
That's not strong enough.

752
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.500
It won't last.

753
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.500
What they need is Not Mere risk avoidance.

754
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.300
Because the brain don't even work right yet until make

755
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.600
those decisions, right? They don't need mere risk avoidance. They

756
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.200
need to be fully awakened to the glories of

757
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.700
the Gospel in Jesus Christ.

758
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.500
All of Christ is far stronger than

759
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.200
any risk of avoidance. Yes, we should

760
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.700
warn of the risk. Yes. We should celebrate the benefits of waiting. But

761
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.500
did you see in Titus 2 what God

762
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.100
has done.

763
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.300
I mean look at he's bought us he's saved us

764
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:21.100
he's training us. He's sustaining us even Ephesians

765
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.400
5 about marriage says Jesus died for

766
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.200
us to sanctify us to cleanse us

767
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.300
with the word to present us to himself in splendor

768
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.400
without spot or wrinkle that we might be holy that

769
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.300
we might be without blemish. This is what he's

770
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.000
done for us.

771
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.500
And why do we do it?

772
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.800
So that we could be his very own.

773
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.500
So that we can be his.

774
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.400
That's a way more compelling reason to walk in holiness.

775
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.100
students listen

776
00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.300
You're going to told your entire life.

777
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.600
That this is what you should do shouldn't do I want you to see that

778
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.400
you are his.

779
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.800
You are his and that gives you privilege and

780
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.200
power and things that you could never do

781
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.000
on your own the ability to overcome Temptation. You can never do

782
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:14.400
on your own.

783
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.500
And there is hope.

784
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.700
When you fail that you can't have on your own.

785
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.200
But that is the hope we're talking about that is way more

786
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.300
compelling for any of you adults as well like this. No matter

787
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:30.400
what Temptation you face the way more compelling way to fight

788
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.800
that is by Jesus being that much better than anything

789
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.200
you face.

790
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.400
I want to choose him. I don't want that.

791
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.800
I don't choose him. He's better. He's the treasure.

792
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.500
But you can only get there if you don't forget who you are.

793
00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.000
Christian you have to remember who you are who

794
00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.200
God made you to be in Jesus?

795
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.300
Some of you might remember a few years ago. We went through the Book of Judges.

796
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.000
And the series was called identity crisis.

797
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.500
Because there's so many things going on about telling us who we are and we

798
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.000
needed to remember.

799
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.600
Who he says we are.

800
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:22.500
And our key passage was first Peter 2 verses 9

801
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.000
and 10 and reminds us even today of who

802
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.200
we are in him Church.

803
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:29.900
that you

804
00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.300
Are a chosen race?

805
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.500
You are a royal priesthood.

806
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.200
a holy nation

807
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.000
a people

808
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.500
for his own possession

809
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:47.700
so that

810
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.300
you may proclaim the excellencies.

811
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.500
Of him who called you out of the darkness

812
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.700
you were in into His Marvelous Light.

813
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:01.800
before

814
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.500
you were not a people.

815
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:07.700
but now

816
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.700
you are God's people.

817
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.600
Before you had not received Mercy.

818
00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:16.400
but now

819
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.600
you have received Mercy.

820
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.100
God's grace changes everything

821
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.300
so let's live more like that is true

822
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.500
every day.

823
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:33.900
God I

824
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.700
come to you we come to you and we just need you.

825
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.400
desperately

826
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.600
We thank you for your word.

827
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.200
Church, just as we reflect now for a

828
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:55.600
moment, maybe.

829
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.200
maybe what God is

830
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.400
prompting you to do and this is just an illustration physically is to open

831
00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.400
your hands before him.

832
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.200
Let invite you do that if you want to if not, that's fine. But but just

833
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.300
as an illustration maybe in your own heart of where you need

834
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.200
to open up your hands where you've been clinging tightly and

835
00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.500
you say Jesus. I need you to run this thing.

836
00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.500
and you just physically right now before you open your

837
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.100
own hands as an

838
00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.500
Example of what your heart is saying to him?

839
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.600
And just to physically in your heart let go.

840
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:38.800
of

841
00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:43.400
the idols to let go of the control to let go of

842
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:45.500
even the past

843
00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.900
God as we do this right now we

844
00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.200
I feel knowing that.

845
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.700
There's someone in this room who's who's got

846
00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.600
the barriers up the walls up?

847
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.500
And they can't open their hands to you. God break through

848
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.100
that right now.

849
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.800
whether it's a sin issue or

850
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.600
A relational issue or a past struggle

851
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.800
or or some doubt? They have God opened

852
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.700
their heart and their eyes right now so they can open their hands to

853
00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:28.900
you.

854
00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.400
God don't let us try to take control with any

855
00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.100
of those selves inside of us. May you take over.

856
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.300
Break us where we need it God. There's so much

857
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.000
we hold on to so much that we are resistant to.

858
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.600
May we see you from your word as worth it.

859
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.300
What you've done?

860
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.600
To make us your own.

861
00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:12.600
How can we not sing your excellencies sing

862
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.800
your Praises? How can we not live in a way that's free

863
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.900
because you've already made us free. How can we not how how

864
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.400
can we not

865
00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.700
Take hold of what you've given us.

866
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.700
And be changed completely for it.

867
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.300
But God that's got to be your work.

868
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.900
Pray for your work in each life here today.

869
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.400
to comfort The Afflicted

870
00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.200
to challenge the lazy

871
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.200
to sustain us as we look ahead to the

872
00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.200
day when we have no more pain or tears.

873
00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.900
God open our eyes our hearts.

874
00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:12.600
in our hands

875
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.300
to respond to you.

876
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.100
Maybe you've never done that before.

877
00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.500
Maybe you're seeing all this and you're like, I don't know anything what you're

878
00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:28.500
talking about. Listen, there's

879
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.100
there's a simple confession to the Lord today in your

880
00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.400
heart that he is.

881
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.900
Your savior because you're a sinner.

882
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.700
And you say Jesus your lord?

883
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.500
Come talk to one of us after.

884
00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.200
Come find me during the songs. I don't

885
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:50.900
care. That's fine.

886
00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.600
But just to deal with this and say Jesus, I'm Yours.

887
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.400
And we jump so quickly to singing or to whatever else is

888
00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.400
next Even in our lives.

889
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.100
Just sit with this let the Lord work in your

890
00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:07.500
heart.

891
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.200
And maybe it means you don't stand up when we start to sing. Maybe it means

892
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.100
you get on your knees or you you take a step of faith

893
00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.500
in some other way to respond. That's all worship is it's not just singing It's worship

894
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.700
is response.

895
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.400
To what God's doing?

896
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.000
We are going to sing to him for what he's done.

897
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.300
but let it be out of a heart of

898
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.200
response
