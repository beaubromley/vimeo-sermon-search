WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.400
so

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.800
have some things I want to give away in context of who we

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.600
are the stuff that we bring as

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.600
an organizational to start this PowerPoint because

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.900
it's going to act as our guide tonight.

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.100
Yeah.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.200
So first stone Ministries is give a

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.900
little bit of an overview of our organization. We've

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.600
been around actually in Oklahoma City

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.800
for a long time and our

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.900
history started in founding as

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.500
a corporation in Oklahoma City as

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.200
Fishers of Men In 1976 changed in

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.700
1983. When a network of Ministries

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.200
at that time got its Charter which was called

16
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.400
Exodus International. We were one of the founding ministries of

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.500
that as well. Unfortunately some of

18
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.700
the history of that I'm not going to go into all that but it it went

19
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.400
into hyper Grace and antonym and basically gay

20
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.100
Christianity and imploded from

21
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.900
from the top but many

22
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200
of the ministry. This is what

23
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.500
you will not hear in the gay meeting or

24
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
media is that we're still here.

25
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.000
And we're still doing the work.

26
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.200
We get our name from The Gospel of John

27
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.300
chapter 8, which says let him chapter 8

28
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.700
verse 7, which says let him who's without

29
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.500
sin cast the first stone and

30
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.800
a lot of times we love to unpack John 8

31
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.800
because John a actually answers a

32
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.400
lot of questions that a lot of people convey concerning

33
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
that Jesus never said

34
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.200
anything about homosexuality and the bottom line on

35
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.100
that is he never had to and that's a whole

36
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.300
nother teaching but wanted you to be aware of a

37
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.200
little bit more of our history. We've been now a full-time Ministry for

38
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.100
31 years. And as a

39
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
part of The Exodus implosion, I

40
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.200
was the chairman of the ministry Council that behind the scenes

41
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.000
brought the charge of Correction and the antinomianism

42
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.300
the hyper Grace the gay Christianity

43
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.300
and so as a

44
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.600
part of that and as a part of other leaders, we had

45
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.700
to form a new network of Ministries.

46
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.300
That was biblically Orthodox and we did

47
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.300
so in 2012 and so there's

48
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.500
a whole nother network of Ministries that help

49
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.400
people overcome all forms

50
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.700
of homosexuality lgbtq, and

51
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.600
that plus sign and folks.

52
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.500
If you don't know what that plus sign is, you may

53
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.400
need some education on that. You'll see a little bit of the plus

54
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.200
sign tonight very quickly, but we are squarely the

55
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.400
biggest thing. I think that we like to say about

56
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.300
ourselves is that we're a Ministry of the Gospel

57
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.600
of Jesus and that doesn't mean just a tagline,

58
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.800
you know, gospel Ministry. We

59
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.900
really want to provide the words

60
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.100
of Jesus Christ to the soul that

61
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.000
brings about what Paul told Timothy

62
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.100
a Pure Life a life

63
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.700
of Purity and surrender. And so

64
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.400
that that's who we are. We have a staff of six

65
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.300
of us one's not

66
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.500
here tonight, and you're going to get to hear from these amazing people

67
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.300
in their stories tonight.

68
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.600
To really proclaim the glory of God and what

69
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.700
we do in discipleship care, we offer

70
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.200
one-on-one. We Minister and groups. We

71
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.100
do public teaching and really try to

72
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.400
equip the body of Christ. You'll see out there

73
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.400
is a literature table that's got

74
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.800
lots of some of the most pertinent questions that

75
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.100
we get out there. So all the literature out

76
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.100
there is freeing for the taking now, there

77
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.200
are three. There are a few items out

78
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.400
there. I have three here that are

79
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.400
not for the taking but I want to give three way

80
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.500
we have some fun with that and Jim's birthday

81
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.300
stand up Jim Farrington. So

82
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.800
his birthday is July 5th.

83
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.000
Who has a July 5th birthday in the

84
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.200
room?

85
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.700
Being you in it. Okay, Jim if you would give that

86
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.300
to that lady in looks a tan

87
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.300
coat. Okay, and then Pastor Scott,

88
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.900
that's where where is he?

89
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.200
He was here right? Anyhow, he?

90
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.300
I'm Phil I said Scott Phil his birthday.

91
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.000
There. He is. His birthday is 12:21, right?

92
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200
Who has a birthday near 1221?

93
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.500
Anyone a week at this Christmas? Okay. Well, what's

94
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.700
your birthday?

95
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.500
Okay, that's probably it is the 19th

96
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.700
the closest. All right. This is the

97
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.800
In His Image DVD pack. It also

98
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.000
has an extra bonus that has 25 other

99
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400
videos that answer pertinent questions

100
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.500
about this. If you would give that to that man, and then

101
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.200
you're going to hear from one of

102
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.700
our staff members who lived a transgendered lifestyle

103
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.400
Laura Beth Perry Laura Beth if you would stand up

104
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.500
and this is her book and she was

105
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.400
born on September 3rd and

106
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.200
you get to give it to him.

107
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.300
Oh, I'm sorry. That's right. She injured her foot.

108
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800
so, this is Laura Lee giving

109
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.300
they're out there September 3rd. Yay. Awesome.

110
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.200
So we we like you to

111
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.700
have and a big part of our ministry is getting

112
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.400
educational materials. And this

113
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.700
is just a little bit of what we have here tonight. We

114
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.600
have a whole library of stuff and lots

115
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.500
of Articles. Now one of the things that's very different

116
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.700
about my book is we

117
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.000
conducted a survey no other Ministry and

118
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.600
all the history of quote unquote ex-game

119
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.500
Ministries. I don't like that term but it's a you

120
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.400
know media sound bite. Yes. I'm ex gay, but

121
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.800
No, Ministry had done a survey on 25

122
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.300
years of client folders because a lot

123
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.200
of the Ministries weren't that old and thank God we had

124
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.600
a social worker who had the wherewithal to

125
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.800
say. We need to track people.

126
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.700
So we had intact folders for 25

127
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.700
years of people and we contacted them

128
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.100
and as a result of there is a fact sheet

129
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.800
out there and the survey and

130
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.600
and it's also in my book and the

131
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.400
last two points and it's in the slide presentation,

132
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.700
but I'll go ahead and mention it now.

133
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.200
92 to 88% of the

134
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.500
people that had come to first stone Ministries considered

135
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.900
themselves completely sexually

136
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.300
broken or addicted with little

137
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.800
progress.

138
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.300
After they received Ministry services from first

139
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.200
stone, most of them several years. I would

140
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.100
say 72 to 73 percent in

141
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.100
this survey show that they

142
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.400
considered themselves free from sexual sin and

143
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.200
Brokenness and living free from any of

144
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.400
those lgbtq+ labels and then

145
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.500
awesome and glory to God, right?

146
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.800
Because honestly when we did the survey I was

147
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.600
thinking man, I'll be glad if I know you know,

148
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.300
Alan Chambers told the world on Oprah's network that

149
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.200
99.9% of people don't change and you'd

150
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.200
be surprised how many people even in the

151
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.900
church repeat that well nobody changes.

152
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.100
You can't change orientation is fixed. That's a

153
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.300
lie.

154
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.500
And we'll get into that more later.

155
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.000
There is a handout out on the table

156
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.200
out there only brought a hundred.

157
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.800
This is a great crowd.

158
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.500
And if you want this you can get this digitally and this

159
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.600
will have all of what I'm talking about plus a

160
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.400
whole lot more and all the scriptures.

161
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.100
So we want you to be equipped and then this AFA Journal

162
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.800
goes along with that DVD that

163
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.000
has mine and Laura best written testimonies. So

164
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.900
this is a big part of what we do we

165
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.300
want to educate is as many

166
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.600
people that are here. We have a fantastic website

167
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.300
with lots of quick links and

168
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.100
easy ways to get information. I have

169
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.600
a Blog

170
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.500
the the book itself has its own

171
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.100
website with all this information.

172
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.800
The fact sheet is on the website as well.

173
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.000
And so we came here to talk about an overview

174
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.200
of homosexuality. You're not going

175
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.400
to get everything. There's a lot of times we will go into churches

176
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.100
and we will break out a lot of

177
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.900
what I'm going to like give you the shotgun approach tonight, but mainly

178
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.500
to underscore the testimonies of

179
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.300
the Lord that make wise as simple because in this

180
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.800
day we need to be making wise people

181
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.400
are simple-minded in believing

182
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.500
The Narrative of the culture that believes

183
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.800
that God isn't working and changing people's lives. So

184
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.500
we need to testimony that people can

185
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.300
really be set free. And so we're going to bring that is

186
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.400
anyone born homosexual and causealities. We're

187
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.800
going to bring that and we try to really as

188
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.700
an organization to underscore everything we

189
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.100
talk about with scripture.

190
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.600
To back it up with verses.

191
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.000
Now there are some things in life in getting

192
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.400
God's will like, you know, should I buy that

193
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.600
house? You might not have a Bible verse on that one.

194
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.600
But there are some things that are just really clear.

195
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.700
Really black and white and human sexuality is

196
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.600
actually one of them.

197
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.000
And then so we do use some psychological perspective

198
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.100
and I would say it's more about

199
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.600
the relational Dynamic like one of

200
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.600
the things I love to use is his needs her needs

201
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.100
by doctors.

202
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.100
I want to say Smalley, but I'm

203
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.400
Hardly, yeah, and you know, you you

204
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.200
look at some of the the differences in

205
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.400
men and women and you know, you realize okay that may

206
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.300
not be right out of the Bible, but it's very helpful and things

207
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.200
like that that we have found. So you'll see that and underscoring

208
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.500
this.

209
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.800
That the Bible is true.

210
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.400
And I was praying about coming tonight and thinking

211
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.500
about this and a lot of times people

212
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.000
will say well I need to know how to help somebody. I

213
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.200
need to know how to help a family member. I need

214
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.600
to know how to help a coworker. I I don't I

215
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.800
don't have the verses right? I don't have understanding but

216
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.500
actually you'd be surprised what

217
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.200
you really do have.

218
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.600
relationally and revealing the God

219
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.300
of Wonders in nature and

220
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.300
it comes right out of Romans chapter 1 which a

221
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:57.900
lot of times the

222
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.400
Gay Christian activists will say well. Those are the clobber verses.

223
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.800
Well, actually no, they're the delightful verses of

224
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.700
the word of God that bring transformation and changed my

225
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.900
life.

226
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.400
completely

227
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.000
over 40 years ago. I celebrated on February 6th

228
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.600
my 40th spiritual birthday this

229
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.800
year and it was an and I

230
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.300
mean an artist surrender to Jesus for

231
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:25.800
40 years.

232
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.800
And I'll share more about that. But this this thing about

233
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.300
nature.

234
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.500
And the glory of God revealed in nature.

235
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.000
He shows you he shows all of us.

236
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.600
That he is present. So his even his

237
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.300
eternal powerhead and godhead.

238
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.600
So that everyone is without excuse.

239
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.400
If you really want and seek God

240
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.700
he will give you the truth and you'll hear in my testimony and

241
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.000
every one of their testimonies God gave

242
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.600
us his truth and it

243
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.600
transformed Our Lives my life first and

244
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.800
Laura Beth Perry's life verse same verse for even new

245
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.900
one. Another Psalms 107 verse 20,

246
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.700
he says and he sent his word to

247
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.700
heal them and to deliver them from their

248
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.400
destruction and he did

249
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.500
that in my story and you will see it but for tonight,

250
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.800
I want to show you a two minute little

251
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.400
clip of nature, you know,

252
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.500
Oprah has her things that she likes right.

253
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.100
Things that Oprah loves things that Oprah like so this

254
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.800
is one of the things I love I love this DVD called

255
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.200
the God of Wonders and this is

256
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.400
the introduction to it. Just watch the

257
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.100
glory of God in this little video clip.

258
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.500
you are

259
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:52.600
it

260
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.600
he is the God of Wonders.

261
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.400
Every single thing that you just saw

262
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.400
is a witness of the glory

263
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.700
of God.

264
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.900
and every single thing that you

265
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.900
saw is teeming with life

266
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.500
with DNA

267
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.600
that was just discovered in the last. Thank

268
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.700
you, brother. Just

269
00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:00.200
Since 2001 was the entire human

270
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.600
genome.

271
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.600
mapped

272
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.600
since 2001 we're only we're only you know, 20 something years

273
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.600
into understanding even greater levels

274
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.400
and depths of DNA.

275
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.500
Why is that important?

276
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.900
Because on the scientific side of this.

277
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.000
We win.

278
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.600
We win completely and the brilliance.

279
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.300
And the Majesty of the mind of

280
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:32.400
God.

281
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.100
Is ever in every single one of you to testify

282
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.700
of the glory of God and you

283
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.200
don't have to start with homosexuality with your

284
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.600
gay identified loved ones.

285
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.200
They need to see the glory of God revealed in

286
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.900
your own life, by the way that you live.

287
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.200
and every every strand of

288
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.500
every single created thing you saw

289
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.200
screams

290
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.500
there is a Creator and a designer.

291
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.300
And that sins like riveting chill bumps

292
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.600
throughout my body. I've seen that documentary. I've memorized

293
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.900
many of the facts from this documentary. It's on

294
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.900
YouTube now, it's free.

295
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.500
And the doctors and the scientists and

296
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.700
the the phds that specifically look

297
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.200
at their areas of expertise of

298
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.200
every single area of nature.

299
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.200
And design of everything you saw and so much

300
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:29.400
more.

301
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.500
That they are able to conclusively point

302
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.300
to there is a Creator a designer

303
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.700
and he has made us clearly male

304
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.700
and female X Y

305
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.700
male XX female and yes, there

306
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.400
are abnormalities and we will look

307
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.100
at that later in the evening, but I'm telling you it's screams

308
00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.500
that God has created us in

309
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.400
His image and the image of God. He created

310
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.400
them male and female and there are answers to

311
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.500
transgenderism and queer. Now if

312
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.700
you're hearing you hear that and that seems shocking that's

313
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.600
not a derogatory term anymore.

314
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.200
That's it. And when I was growing up,

315
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.300
you know in the 70s.

316
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.000
That was a derogatory term.

317
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.500
Now it's an identity.

318
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.000
It's an identity of a person who wants to Proclaim. They

319
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.500
have no gender. They're non-binary

320
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.200
or as someone who

321
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.300
is they're queering it trying to figure it out by practicing

322
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.200
all kinds of sexual behavior.

323
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.700
This is the culture we live in now.

324
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.100
So it's really important to know there's so much

325
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.800
more we could talk about concerning the science, but

326
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.700
I just want to I didn't

327
00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.600
put it in the PowerPoint, but I do want to just

328
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.800
read this out loud. I love God's word. It really

329
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.900
has just totally changed my

330
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.200
life.

331
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.600
And many people when they see this they'll see

332
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.900
this in context, you know about Psalms 19. I

333
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.100
want to read this. It's just so magnificent starting

334
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.900
in verse 7.

335
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.000
the law

336
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.600
of the Lord is perfect converting the soul.

337
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.000
Hmm really? Is it confer? Does it

338
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:25.100
really Challenge and transform exposes? It

339
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.200
does it did me and this

340
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.100
is part of my testimony.

341
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.000
The testimony of the Lord is sure making wise

342
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.000
the stem the simple the statues of

343
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.300
the Lord are right rejoicing the heart.

344
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.200
The Commandment of the Lord is pure

345
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.000
enlightening the eyes the fear of

346
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.800
the Lord is clean enduring forever.

347
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.600
The judgments of the Lord are true and

348
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.600
righteous altogether more are to

349
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.400
be desired then gold yea then fine

350
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.600
gold and sweeter also than the honeycomb and

351
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.500
more over by them is your servant warned

352
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.000
and in keeping them is great

353
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.200
reward. That's that's part of

354
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.200
my testimonial verse and then the grace of God has

355
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.400
appeared unto all men bringing salvation

356
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.400
Titus to 11 and 12. We

357
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.900
have Grace that is said, oh it's just unmerited favor.

358
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.800
You can do whatever you want. No Paul's letter

359
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.200
here in Titus Chapter

360
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.400
2 verses 11 through

361
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:28.700
14.

362
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.800
Says it instructs us to deny

363
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.500
ungodliness and to live righteously

364
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.800
right now in this present life.

365
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.300
And that's what we teach and disciple and

366
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.300
Pastor Souls into to receive the

367
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.300
grace of God not in vain but to receive

368
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.300
it to rest the power of the Holy Spirit to bring

369
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.400
about transformation and that was certainly true

370
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.300
of my story. So in a group like this,

371
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.100
I would imagine and some of

372
00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.300
you may be shocked but the latest stats from

373
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.300
the pier.

374
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.300
Once they Barna it's not Borno the other the other

375
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.100
group that does statistical.

376
00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.500
the latest numbers

377
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.700
for Evangelical churches

378
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.500
Bible believing churches Catholics and

379
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.800
even liberal Christian churches.

380
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.700
The number is around 15

381
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.900
to 17 percent that believe

382
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.400
in heaven and hell and that the Bible is true

383
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.600
and that

384
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.600
that gay living a gay lifestyle is

385
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.000
sinful.

386
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.900
And several years ago of another statistical

387
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.900
thing that was run by Christian Broadcasting Network

388
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.500
along with focus on the family. It showed

389
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.900
and this was Man 10, 15 years ago. It showed

390
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.500
that 60% of the

391
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.300
youth groups.

392
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:02.200
across all Evangelical youth youth believed

393
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.400
did not know the first and first and last

394
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.200
book of the Bible didn't know the name of it.

395
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.400
They didn't know the names of the four Gospels.

396
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.300
They didn't believe that Jesus lived to send us

397
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:14.400
life.

398
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.500
They didn't believe that that Mary was

399
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:18.800
a virgin.

400
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.300
But guess what they did believe.

401
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.000
About 15 years ago. You think it might have increased a little

402
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.100
bit in 15 years, you know what they believed in.

403
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.100
UFOs

404
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.700
and that gay marriage should be allowed.

405
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.900
So I think scripture is really important.

406
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.100
And so we and we usually will take

407
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.900
at least an hour. You're so glad I'm not going to take all this time, but knowing

408
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.000
the word of God about sexuality and

409
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.500
homosexuality is probably very

410
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.100
imperative for the Christian church today. Especially Christian

411
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.300
leaders. I was in a conversation

412
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.100
with a dear friend, who is the national

413
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.400
radio host.

414
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.800
Just before getting here tonight.

415
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.200
And she was telling me about a conversation with another National

416
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.500
Pastor that if I drop names you'd

417
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.900
probably know them. I won't do that.

418
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.200
but the conversation is going like this

419
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.300
and that is

420
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.100
Steven remember when you talked to us and was talking

421
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.600
to some leaders about homosexuality and Holiness

422
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.300
and I said, yeah. Yeah, and she goes well we're having

423
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.500
this conversation again, and now at the

424
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.800
top places in

425
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.200
The Southern Baptist Church and I go to a Southern Baptist

426
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.700
Church that my interests and she said to

427
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.700
me that yeah, you know, you've heard

428
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.600
the messaging before now. Can I just ask

429
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.800
and she's wanting to pick my brain how to communicate this

430
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.200
and bottom line was

431
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.300
If you are male and female.

432
00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.100
If you are x y and x x you are

433
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:05.500
innately biologically created

434
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.700
in the

435
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.900
image of God heterosexual.

436
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.800
Heterosexuality is not an orientation.

437
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.500
Heterosexuality is a part

438
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.200
of how you've been created as a human being.

439
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.400
Now unfortunately, you know psychology came in

440
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.300
the 1870s and gave us these words. You

441
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.400
know what it was called back in then before we had all

442
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.400
these orientations.

443
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.600
male

444
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.300
and female

445
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.000
right

446
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.400
So when we described human beings they were male

447
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.700
and female. I mean some of this some of you may go.

448
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.800
But we are so distorted we have this thing so

449
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.400
jaded and when you even hearing

450
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.700
me say this some of this may seem well, that's silly. Well

451
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.700
who you've been listening to?

452
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.800
You've been listening to the culture that tells you that orientation or

453
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.300
your great PhD leader in

454
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.600
the church that tells you that it's it's viable that

455
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.200
yes, there is gay Christianity and we should embrace it.

456
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.500
I could name all kinds of names that have done this. So scripture is

457
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.900
really important. We start off with Genesis. These are

458
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.500
the verses everything that are on the handouts out

459
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.200
there. We start off with the idea. We're made

460
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.400
in God's image. And then I think it's important to understand

461
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.400
the the story about Sodom and Gomorrah, but before

462
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.600
that the rainbow,

463
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.100
Do you know when I see the rainbow Banner which is

464
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.900
not really called the rainbow Banner anymore. It's called The Pride Banner.

465
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.600
I weep.

466
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.000
I weep because I see the prophecy of what's coming.

467
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.800
in second Peter chapter 3 isn't it interesting that

468
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.700
the very

469
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.800
Icon of judgment seem a

470
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.700
lot of people when they see the rainbow. They they think of only about

471
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.500
the promise that God is not going

472
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.500
to destroy the entire Earth again

473
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.100
by flood by water.

474
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.100
But they missed the other part of the promise.

475
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.100
God is going to destroy the Earth again.

476
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.100
by fire

477
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.900
and I just think it's I ironic that the

478
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.600
very people group that this flag

479
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.300
because I'm a vexologist means study of flags and I

480
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.300
have flags and all my office and I love the history about

481
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.200
flags and I and I thought how ironic that

482
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.400
this flag is flying over a people

483
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:36.700
group.

484
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.300
That are lgbtq promoting

485
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.700
the idea of sodomy.

486
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:43.700
so

487
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.200
very important to know the scriptures on this we're going

488
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.400
to fly through this very quickly because you want to hear some amazing

489
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.300
testimonies.

490
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:57.600
We could go through all these verses a lot of times people good bible-believing

491
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.200
Christians say, well, there's only like

492
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.700
two or three verses in the Old Testament and maybe

493
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.900
two or three verses in.

494
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.400
The New Testament I'm going no. No, actually there

495
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.800
are 10 passages of scripture that

496
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.600
in one way or another deal directly with

497
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.200
homosexuality in the Old Testament.

498
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.900
Leviticus 18:22 and the

499
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.100
reason why this is so important in the law of the Lord converting the

500
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.200
soul and I'm gonna get ahead of myself because I'm just going to go roll through

501
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.300
my testimony real fast.

502
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.700
The night I was saved.

503
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.400
I was led to the Lord by some

504
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.100
people in a little trailer park in the coma Park.

505
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.400
And I heard this voice.

506
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.300
And this voice in my mind said if you do not accept me tonight,

507
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.200
you're going to die.

508
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.300
And I I pretty much thought it was God. I

509
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.100
mean because the only voices I ever

510
00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.100
heard was something you know perverted and it was like this has to be

511
00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.500
God and then my heart was racing racing and

512
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.500
all I know is I needed to ask this

513
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.100
guy named Steve.

514
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.500
I need to know God Like You

515
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.500
people because there was something amazing in their

516
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:12.800
home.

517
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.300
The presence of God was in their home.

518
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.000
And so we prayed the prayer and then on my way

519
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.700
home. This girl asked me this question.

520
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.500
Does this mean you're not going to be gay anymore?

521
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:24.900
And I said

522
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:26.600
I don't know.

523
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.500
I guess it means whatever God has for me.

524
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.300
So I went downstairs took this big

525
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.400
do-way version of the Bible Blessed Pope because

526
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.000
we were raised Catholic and there's so much

527
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.700
there could talk to you about but big big book this

528
00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.500
book Family Bible the just

529
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.000
off at lugged it down prayed over it and said

530
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.300
the priest in my mom's Parish in Midwest

531
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.500
City was telling me it's okay to be gay wink wink

532
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.600
all the reason more to come to mass even

533
00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.400
trying to seduce me. I'm like, I'm really confused.

534
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.200
So I opened up the Bible and lo

535
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.600
and behold. I mean he's got all these pictures from the

536
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.400
bat again and all kinds of stuff. I flipped

537
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:11.900
that thing open.

538
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.600
Guess what passage it landed on?

539
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.000
This life giving passage

540
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.300
that most people hate to even

541
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:27.100
quote in context of homosexuality Leviticus

542
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.100
18:22.

543
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.200
You should not lie with the malice woman with a woman. That's an

544
00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.200
Abomination. And when I saw that verse I was like,

545
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.800
oh my gosh, they've all been lying to me.

546
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.200
Because you know, I thought it was born gay.

547
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.300
Because you know back in the late seventies and

548
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.900
even in the early eighties, you know, you're born this way.

549
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.100
And the law of God hit me that night in a

550
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.300
way and I thought it's really in the Bible.

551
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.500
And I believed.

552
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.200
And I got down on my knees. I said God, I don't even know how

553
00:29:59.200 --> 00:29:59.600
to change.

554
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.300
And I got involved with some people that were on fire.

555
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:04.600
for the Lord

556
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.200
and there's a monument to it's a little teepee church

557
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.000
out of 178th and MacArthur.

558
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.500
And God transformed My Life by that

559
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.300
pastor's love.

560
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:19.200
Set Me Free with the word of God but then there's a Dr.

561
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.600
Robert Gagnon one of my mentors in

562
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.500
the Lord one amazing man of God told me

563
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.400
about there's a run on you know, that's a run-on

564
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:27.800
sentence.

565
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.700
the very few pastors will ever touch

566
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.000
and that's verse 23.

567
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.300
Well, we better start touching it because you know, what's

568
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.000
happening in the culture.

569
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.300
It's changing really fast.

570
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.300
They're changing the glory of God to Incorruptible God

571
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.900
into the image of corruptible, man.

572
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.500
Even President Biden's nuclear waste

573
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.700
manager with his red mohawk.

574
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.500
engaging in what's called Puppy Love

575
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.700
And now this is mainstream. I know some of this may be absolutely shocking

576
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.400
to you. But this is Frontline stuff. I'm dealing

577
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.400
with every day now.

578
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:03.500
front line

579
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.400
and guess where if it's coming to us and the

580
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.800
future persecution coming to little Church Ministries, like

581
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.600
first stone. Guess who's next?

582
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.400
So this is really important to know that they are coming for

583
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.400
our children. And if I we had time we could

584
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.000
even watch them singing about it. So there's lots of

585
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.800
verses in every single verse in the Bible new testament

586
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:31.900
old testament always always condemns

587
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.800
homosexual Behavior to

588
00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.600
say otherwise is just just disingenuous or

589
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.100
a woman should not wear anything pertaining

590
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.300
to a man now, isn't it interesting

591
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.500
since 2015 what has

592
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.800
happened just since 2015 anybody like

593
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.600
football in here.

594
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.600
Anybody like ESPN?

595
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.000
They gave Bruce Jenner the courage award.

596
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.300
for transforming himself

597
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.400
That's sweet.

598
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.300
It's where our culture is, right? So then it gives way

599
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:06.800
to this.

600
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.800
Two years later. We have this new thing called drag queen Story Hour.

601
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.900
And this is happening all over the

602
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.000
country. And yes here in Oklahoma City.

603
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.000
And I can tell you lots of stories about this but these are

604
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.000
all the different places that's happening in libraries and

605
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.000
in schools across our nation. It is to normalize

606
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.200
lgbtq to children and

607
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.600
ironically some of

608
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.100
the biggest leaders in the Nea want this.

609
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.300
Now this is the you see

610
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:40.800
the pink.

611
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.600
That is a quote from drag queens themselves.

612
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.500
Drag queens are lgbtq adult entertainers for

613
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.700
lgbtq bar audiences

614
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.400
and many are strippers.

615
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.700
And many as strippers they provide the most bile displays

616
00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.200
of sodomy and gay bar atmospheres for fun.

617
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.500
adult entertainers for toddlers

618
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.400
An elementary school, I mean, you know when I

619
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.700
was at Catholic School parochial school we talked

620
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.200
about maybe bringing a clown in.

621
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.200
They said no clowns are much too scary for

622
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.200
children to bring in. You know, we can't bring in clowns.

623
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.600
That looks pretty scary to me.

624
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.600
Anyhow, just wanted to drop that that this is really something because

625
00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.300
they're saying that the reason why God

626
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:35.200
destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah was because of their in hospitality

627
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.600
and unkindness and yet

628
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.400
the New Testament actually tells us the

629
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.400
truth. Also in Jude's passage that actually

630
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.900
was destroyed because of their sexual impurity. Look

631
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.500
there's ten passages of scripture that in one

632
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.600
way or another deal with human sexual Brokenness specifically

633
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.600
speaking to sexual immorality.

634
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.500
There's a lot more than just two verses folks.

635
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:03.000
And you know every single time it underscores

636
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:06.000
the practice is immoral. Do you

637
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.500
not know that the unrighteous see

638
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.400
it's asking a question because I think it's pertinent even

639
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.600
to today's Church.

640
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.600
Do you not know?

641
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.900
That those who practice such things that they're not inherit

642
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.400
the kingdom of God.

643
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.600
Did you did you know that your Bible actually says that oh, but

644
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.500
wait wait, I'm a good Southern Baptist.

645
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.600
I'm go to Southern Baptist Church. God say I

646
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.400
pray to prayer.

647
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.300
Oh, no, no, what about believing resulting in

648
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.200
righteousness, you know, there's not more parts

649
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.300
to the Bible in Romans 10.

650
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.800
Yes call upon the name of the Lord but be transformed and

651
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.100
then you see there's a whole list of

652
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.400
sins. It's not we're not just singling out the homosexual.

653
00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.800
So important to know that this is actually in your

654
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.800
Bibles and I love this and such

655
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.100
were some of you but you were washed.

656
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.600
Such were some of us we were washed. We were

657
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.300
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by

658
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.300
this spirit of God, and there's many other verses we could

659
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.200
go into and look at they're all here. We break them out

660
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.300
a lot of times. We'll take another hour. Just talking about this.

661
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.300
But I want to get into the testimonies and I want you to hear our stories

662
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.500
and I want you to understand that up

663
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.500
here you see.

664
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.400
Causalities and if you'll pay

665
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.300
attention to these and you may not be able to get this

666
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.200
right here and take a picture of it or you can get it in

667
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.100
my book or on the handouts.

668
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.500
But perception can be really real in a

669
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.200
young person's life that they somehow feel you know

670
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.800
that they're born in the wrong body.

671
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.100
Or that they're homosexual like I was I you know.

672
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.700
When you see my story you'll see you know, there's formation of

673
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.600
early childhood development. This is

674
00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.000
the stuff we unpack that is a bit psychological but

675
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.100
still truth bearing.

676
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.600
It still gives raisins and it gives hope when

677
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.500
you have knowledge knowledge can

678
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.000
equip but knowing him will do better.

679
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.700
knowledge equips but knowing Jesus will say

680
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.100
And then defensive Detachment, you know that Walling off

681
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.800
a deal with so much I had it all of us have had defensive

682
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.100
Detachment in one way or another which is you know,

683
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.500
Walling off your heart from your same sex parent.

684
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.700
And then these other things family history family background

685
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.100
arrested emotional development where you

686
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.500
don't develop don't fail. I mean, honestly, I

687
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.300
wasn't until I was in my late 20s and 30s

688
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.400
and there's a couple people here that used to go to church out there

689
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.300
at the teepee church and when they saw me coming in that church

690
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.600
like and that was Cowboy Church and they're going oh my goodness

691
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.200
what has just walked into the door.

692
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.400
You should have seen me 40 years ago now.

693
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.100
You know, maybe not quite the stud that you

694
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.200
would like for me to be but I've come a long way,

695
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.400
baby.

696
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.500
And peer pressure is a huge

697
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.700
thing. This is one of the most diabolical things

698
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.400
that I think is happening to our children.

699
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.300
Our children. We're talking Elementary School.

700
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.400
So my story real short just gonna put

701
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.900
it out there because I want to my staff to share.

702
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.300
There's causality sexual abuse.

703
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.800
ridicule

704
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.300
beaten

705
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:30.000
I was what they call, you know, the emotional sensitive artistic

706
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.400
young man.

707
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.900
Dad was out of the pitcher and Julie Greenland or Taiwan

708
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.900
and other places in the military career military

709
00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.400
stationed out here at tinker.

710
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.200
And I didn't know Dad for about the first six years of my life when he came

711
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.900
back into the picture. He was scary.

712
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.300
Disciplinarian good old country boy

713
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.400
from Kentucky married my mom at the

714
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.600
end of World War Two and stationed here

715
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.300
in Tinker. She's a war bride from England.

716
00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.800
And this this boy was one messed up

717
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.700
young man.

718
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.700
To where by the time I was 14, I was completely engrossed

719
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.600
into a world

720
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.900
of homosexuality and honestly some

721
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.600
of the Rich and Powerful in this city at the

722
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:14.700
time.

723
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:16.800
It's heartbreaking.

724
00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.600
and the level of delusion I was under

725
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.300
to allow men to do what they did to me thinking it

726
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:25.700
was love.

727
00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.700
But Jesus got a hold of me in 1983 in

728
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.900
my life has never been the same.

729
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.200
And he used his word to heal me but you

730
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.200
know what the testimony goes on right and it should go

731
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:37.300
on.

732
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.000
one of the most

733
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.400
challenging and Faith testing things I

734
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.400
ever had was the day. I took a national stand against

735
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.300
Exodus International in the antinomianism.

736
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.200
My daughter went into the hospital that night.

737
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.200
She was a daddy's girl. She was so much

738
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:55.600
like me.

739
00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.700
Her name was charity. Hope

740
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.600
The next day she died from an unexplained

741
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.200
brain. Tumor.

742
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.200
Aneurysm wasn't aneurysm is

743
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.100
a mass in her brain. We never

744
00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.300
did find out what it was.

745
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.200
But I knew then I was in

746
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.400
one dark spiritual war.

747
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.300
And the testimony of the Lord is is I don't care what you've

748
00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:22.700
gone through.

749
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.000
What pain you have faced?

750
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.500
Jesus is enough if

751
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.300
It's that giant word if if you'll keep

752
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.200
drawing near to Him He will draw near to you.

753
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.700
This was the last family picture. I have I have

754
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.500
a son who's 34 and daughter Mandy

755
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.600
my oldest in the middle got married. This was

756
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.000
her wedding.

757
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.400
And charity on the end and their spouses.

758
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.900
And charity did marry and she had

759
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.200
a little boy and the last thing

760
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.700
she said to me and she was holding the little boy and steady. I really

761
00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.000
did want to raise him. So honey, you're gonna

762
00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.900
get to race him daddy. This is so serious. So no

763
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.700
you're gonna get to raise him and I just knew I

764
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.300
believed with all my heart that God was not going to allow.

765
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.400
Her to die when I am so totally surrendered to

766
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.400
God with my whole heart.

767
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:17.900
But he did.

768
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.800
And he's taught me a lot of things and I'll just tell you the Book

769
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.100
of Job has become a big friend to me.

770
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.400
That's why I like showing that nature video because God

771
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.600
addressed Joe. So we'll

772
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.000
let some of these others come and share.

773
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.500
One of the microphones right here.

774
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.900
Okay, it wasn't ready to go first.

775
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.700
well

776
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.400
I want to start off with Mark chapter 10.

777
00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.600
verses 17 through 21

778
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.000
A man to purchased Jesus and says to him.

779
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:06.100
Good teacher what must I do to be saved and Jesus says, why do

780
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.900
you call me? Good? There's no good. But God Alone.

781
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.000
And he says you need to do this this and this and he

782
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.100
said I've done that for my youth.

783
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:14.400
and

784
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.100
and it then it says in verse 21 and this is

785
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.700
really important because we hear a lot about how Jesus just loves Jesus

786
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.200
just loves he's all love.

787
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.400
And it says Jesus looking on the man loved him.

788
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.100
And said to him one thing you lack.

789
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.900
Go sell all you have to give it to the poor and then

790
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.100
he finished with this take up your cross and

791
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:35.500
follow me.

792
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.300
It's about a Crucified Life.

793
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.100
In 1999. I came to a place

794
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.900
where I had been I had sacrificed every ounce

795
00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.300
of dignity and energy pouring into

796
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.600
a homosexual identity.

797
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.500
Um, and I just came away disillusioned and

798
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.300
disappointed and despondent and really wanting to

799
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:02.000
be free and from 1996 to 1999.

800
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.300
I just I kept running into this

801
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.000
same thing. I don't want to be gay. I don't want to be gay.

802
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.000
I'm tired of being gay.

803
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.300
But I I wasn't willing to surrender it wasn't

804
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.900
really willing to lay my life down.

805
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.500
And then God's mercy he would bring people into my

806
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.400
life that were the presence of God the kindness

807
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:22.900
of God.

808
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.200
They weren't trying to change me. They weren't condemning me. They

809
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.400
weren't beating me over the head. They were just loving me. I worked in a restaurant. So

810
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.600
I was bringing them foods that that's probably why they were so nice, right?

811
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.300
but

812
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.300
but I had one one specific night that I had this

813
00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.300
I was supposed to wait on this one table.

814
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.000
And I got taken from that and put on this other table and it was

815
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.500
these three ladies. I got over here to these three

816
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.500
ladies and one of them said you're gonna think I'm crazy, but God's

817
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.200
trying to get your attention and he wants to talk to you way. A father wants to talk

818
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:52.900
to his son.

819
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.400
And at that point I had already been aware that I think God

820
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.300
is pursuing me. I just don't know why.

821
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.200
And you know, I've done all these things and I've rebelled against him. I

822
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:03.500
don't know why.

823
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.200
And I had her write it down for

824
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.000
me and I have it laminated. I keep it in my Bible.

825
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.900
but she says

826
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.300
the father of all creation wants to talk to you and it's a serious

827
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:15.600
matter.

828
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.900
And I knew and I told her you're not crazy. I know you're

829
00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:20.300
right.

830
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.700
And that that brought me to a place where I could I could I

831
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.000
could

832
00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.800
I was willing to lay my life down. I I said to to the Lord if

833
00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.300
it kills me. I'm gonna follow you, but I can't live like this anymore.

834
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.800
And you know for three years trying to get free and

835
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.900
never being able to get free.

836
00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.200
And then within 24 hours of that moment.

837
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.700
I knew something had changed.

838
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.300
And my friends would come by the house and go. Hey, we're gonna go party and

839
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:48.600
like

840
00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.200
that's not me anymore.

841
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.500
And I had one one man at work that says so this

842
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.100
mean you like girls now and I'm like, that's not what this is about.

843
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.700
And I say that and the next following four

844
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.400
years. Whereas My Discovery into who God created

845
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.100
me to be and the identity he gave me as a man.

846
00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.400
And one of the things that was a huge

847
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.100
Revelation and like Stephen has said I realized I was through

848
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:18.000
scripture and through through communion with

849
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:20.600
the Lord that I had been created heterosexual and

850
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.100
I only struggle with homosexual sin and that changed

851
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.500
everything because it meant that I could take that old identity and laid

852
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.200
it down the cross and received from Jesus everything he had

853
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:29.500
for me.

854
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.600
Now what began to happen is that how did

855
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.300
I end up with this?

856
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.700
Gay identity so I had to look at my history.

857
00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.600
And the Lord empowered me.

858
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.100
He had me he gave me the strength to

859
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.000
be able to look back into my past and I uncovered I

860
00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.400
had over 34 different people that poured into me sexually from around

861
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.800
the age of six or before to the age of 14.

862
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.400
And I had a broken relationship my father. My father didn't have

863
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.500
anything to do with me because I wasn't manly boy. I was

864
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.400
also like Steven very sensitive and tender

865
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.000
and creative and talented emotional.

866
00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.100
And I had a codependent relationship with my mother.

867
00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.300
And I got a hold of some

868
00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.100
material that was put forth by Dentistry Ministries

869
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.500
and it uncovered this Brokenness toward

870
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:16.900
my mother.

871
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.100
And it revealed my mom and I are

872
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.200
not close. I was under the impression for years that we were close.

873
00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.400
And I realized no we're broken.

874
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.000
you know, but then I was like

875
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.700
But wait, there's more.

876
00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.000
So, how do I do it the more?

877
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.600
And and what was interesting is that for those those

878
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.700
last remaining about 10 years? I was living homosexually.

879
00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.300
I was getting the first stone newsletter.

880
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.200
And I was reading testimonies of people's lives are

881
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.300
being transformed.

882
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.700
And there was this there was a spot in the back of my mind when I would read these testimonies

883
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.600
and and the newsletter. I would see a cluster

884
00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.000
of grapes hanging on a vine the sun's glistening

885
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.100
off of the drops of water falling off of the fruit.

886
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.100
You know, it was like life that we could

887
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:09.400
see life in it, right? It did wasn't enough for me to go. Okay. I'll

888
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.500
stop being gay now, but it gave

889
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:15.000
me hope that that there was

890
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.300
that there is an answer there is hope out there, you know.

891
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.200
I just had we threw all of that mess and that's what brought

892
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.700
me back to Oklahoma City to go through Living Waters and

893
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.200
start doing the hard work of uncovering all the

894
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.400
things that happened. I mean, I took on a gay identity at age

895
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.400
12, I didn't even know anything about sexuality, but I just figured

896
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.400
this must be this must be what I am because

897
00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.800
this keeps happening to me.

898
00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:42.400
You know my parents weren't there to protect me and nurture me

899
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.200
and guide me and they weren't the scaffold around that I needed.

900
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.600
But but at first stone, I began to get the language that

901
00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.800
I needed to know that Jesus had the

902
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.400
ability to come into these broken places and

903
00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.400
and bring healing and restoration and

904
00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.300
identity.

905
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.400
And and you know, it's interesting

906
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.600
in my mom. My mom was

907
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.000
really funny and coming out of all of that. She had

908
00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:12.200
been exposed to all of my mess and there

909
00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.100
was one particular day that we were walking into a Walmart

910
00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:15.900
and she said, you know

911
00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:20.200
You look really comfortable in your sexuality and

912
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.400
she was talking about the Redemptive one.

913
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.100
Right, I'd exposed her to everything, you know, experiment experimenting

914
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.200
with drag and what have you

915
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.900
and and all that confusion and she didn't know what to do with me.

916
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.200
But anyway in my involvement with

917
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.500
first stone, I got the language that I needed to begin

918
00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.200
to say yes to Jesus and all the

919
00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.000
places where I was broken and

920
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.300
and it it's brought me to this point where now I'm on staff as

921
00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:51.400
immense Minister. I lead our parents support group because I have a

922
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.500
36 year old daughter who identifies as lesbian,

923
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:58.400
but she's saying she's not mind non-binary and I

924
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.500
have a 39 year old daughter.

925
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.300
And and one of

926
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:06.800
the things that I love about what we do is that is

927
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.100
that the word of God is true.

928
00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.400
That I'm standing here because

929
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.400
the word of God is true. It says that he who

930
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.800
laces life down for my sake this thing will find it and that that's

931
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.000
I found that that's that's exemplifies my

932
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.200
life. I laid it down in Jesus said this is who you

933
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:23.700
really are.

934
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.800
And so that's why I'm here.

935
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.500
Hey there.

936
00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.500
I was born into a family of three older siblings.

937
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.000
My mom a homemaker and my dad a wheat and cattle farmer.

938
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.300
We attended church every time the doors were open.

939
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.000
Before I was school age, my father expressed the word stupid and

940
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.300
discussed over something that failed to

941
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.200
work to his benefit.

942
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:09.600
Seeing an opportunity Satan caused this word to pierce my

943
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:09.800
heart.

944
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.100
I then took on an identity that was never meant to

945
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:14.200
be.

946
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.800
Anytime work with my dad went poorly.

947
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.900
I felt the sting of the words. You're stupid

948
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.800
ringing around in my mind.

949
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:25.900
I grew angrier.

950
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:27.400
with my father

951
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:28.800
in fact

952
00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:30.900
I hated him.

953
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.400
I'm the youngest of four siblings and there's

954
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.200
a big age gap between me and the rest of them.

955
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.700
And my older siblings went to school out of town away.

956
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.100
So I didn't get to know them very well growing up.

957
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.100
The brother I was around most teased me for not

958
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.200
being physically strong enough to do certain tasks.

959
00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.600
Well, I hated men who were similar to my dad. I

960
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.500
admired other men exhibiting physical strength.

961
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:04.900
confidence

962
00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:06.500
and compassion

963
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.000
the admiration digressed into Envy

964
00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.800
and eventually lust

965
00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.200
I became hooked on pornography and masturbation.

966
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.500
As early as 10 years old.

967
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.300
Throughout my teenage years. I was crying out to God

968
00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:23.800
for help.

969
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.100
Through the words of the Prophet Ezekiel in chapter 36 a

970
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.200
verse was extended to me.

971
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.200
I will give you a new heart and I will put my

972
00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.000
a new spirit within you and I'll remove the Heart of

973
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.200
Stone from your flesh and give you a heart of Flesh.

974
00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.100
And I'll put my spirit within you and cause you

975
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.400
to walk in my statutes.

976
00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.400
And be careful to obey obey my rules.

977
00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.400
This Promise came at a good time

978
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.400
I was losing hope that anything could break through my sin

979
00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.100
hardened heart.

980
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:02.900
God began to demonstrate his love for me in overt

981
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:03.300
ways.

982
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.400
Upon that Foundation. I've been slowly learning how

983
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.200
to apply his word and his ways into my

984
00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:10.500
life.

985
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:14.300
Some of the biggest growth points have been building

986
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.800
strong against accountability into my technology.

987
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.200
Processing what's actually going on in my secret

988
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.400
thoughts for giving those who have offended me

989
00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.400
and learning how to express my anger in

990
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.300
constructive ways.

991
00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.600
One such Milestone was that I chose to forgive

992
00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:31.900
my father.

993
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:36.200
This enabled me to renounce the LIE of believing that

994
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:36.900
I was stupid.

995
00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.200
fast forward 13 years ago at the

996
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:42.900
age of 40

997
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.000
I decided I needed a complete medical checkup.

998
00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.600
At that first meeting my doctor exposed me.

999
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.500
To something that rocked my understanding of

1000
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.000
myself.

1001
00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.500
Our sex chromosomes tell us that XY is

1002
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:00.800
male.

1003
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.100
and x-axis female

1004
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:07.500
while my physical body tells me that I am distinctly male.

1005
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.800
My sex chromosomes tell me that I am XX y.

1006
00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.400
And Genetically speaking.

1007
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.400
I have an intersex condition.

1008
00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.200
One out of 600 men.

1009
00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.800
The stat is even better one out of 450

1010
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.000
men in some surveys have this condition.

1011
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.400
And for each of us our sperm isn't viable for producing

1012
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:32.800
children.

1013
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.900
and our bodies produce little if any testosterone

1014
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.400
Which contributes to physical strength stamina confidence

1015
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.900
and a positive sense of

1016
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:44.400
well-being?

1017
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.700
The self-hatred that I had of my body was deeper

1018
00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.700
than what I had learned in pornography and in

1019
00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:53.500
comparison to other men.

1020
00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.500
My brother's teasing.

1021
00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.800
finally made sense

1022
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.700
some men who have this condition experience confusion

1023
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:03.500
in their gender.

1024
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.800
While there is no doubt that I am a man.

1025
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.000
Being genetically different. How am I supposed to view myself?

1026
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.800
Listen to God's perspective on this from Isaiah 56

1027
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.000
verses 1 through 5. Thus says

1028
00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:21.800
the Lord keep Justice and do righteousness

1029
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.300
for soon. My salvation will come

1030
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.500
am I righteousness will be revealed.

1031
00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.300
Blessed is the man who does this and the

1032
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.400
son of man who holds it fast who keeps the

1033
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.500
Sabbath not refining it and keeps his

1034
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.900
hand from doing any evil.

1035
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.800
Let not the Foreigner who has joined himself to the Lord. Say the

1036
00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.000
Lord shall surely separate me from his people.

1037
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.900
And let not the eunuch say behold.

1038
00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.900
I am a dry tree.

1039
00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.200
For thus says the Lord to the Unix. He

1040
00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.100
keep my sabbaths who choose the things that please me

1041
00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:00.200
and hold fast my Covenant. I will give in my house

1042
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.900
and within my walls and monument and a

1043
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.300
name better than sons and daughters.

1044
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:12.100
I will give them an everlasting name. That shall not

1045
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:12.700
be cut off.

1046
00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.700
What is true about me is that I am created male by God

1047
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.100
In His Image?

1048
00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:23.100
I'm also a conduit of God's tender powerful

1049
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:25.300
and affirming Grace. We're both myself and for

1050
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.400
others in the body of Christ.

1051
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.100
I need God's grace to walk out my male gender.

1052
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.200
According to his ways while building up my emotions

1053
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.900
and my abilities according to God's will for my life.

1054
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.900
I need his grace.

1055
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.400
to deny false Idols of masculinity

1056
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.600
of confidence and of strength

1057
00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.300
So in an act of solidarity with God's word, I am

1058
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.900
choosing to delight and being fearfully and wonderfully made in

1059
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:52.300
His image.

1060
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.200
Well, I still find myself in the strength of

1061
00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:56.300
man.

1062
00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.600
I am not a homosexual.

1063
00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:02.800
I am made in God's image and it was created for Pure relationships

1064
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.000
with men and with women.

1065
00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.000
Thank you.

1066
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:23.200
I

1067
00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.400
the director of women's Ministries

1068
00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.800
But how do you get into a job like this?

1069
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.400
Well, I'm redeemed liar and Deceiver.

1070
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.800
sexually seductive

1071
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:42.900
with a history

1072
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.700
beginning from very young

1073
00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:47.800
kindergarten, Maybe

1074
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.600
Have committing predatory behavior in my classmates my

1075
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.500
friends my cousins.

1076
00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.100
and all the while being hungry

1077
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.200
for the knowledge of God

1078
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.500
being hungry for his ways.

1079
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.500
But the disconnect was just ridiculous.

1080
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.800
Titus describes me really well.

1081
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.400
says they profess to know God but

1082
00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.000
by their deeds they deny him.

1083
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.600
Being detestable and disobedient worthless for

1084
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.000
any good.

1085
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.900
So what does God do with somebody like this?

1086
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.700
Well, he starts drawing.

1087
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:38.000
A lot of the a lot of the people that I encounter people

1088
00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.000
who are trying to find an answer for their loved ones,

1089
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:40.400
too.

1090
00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.800
But I'm I was one of those.

1091
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:47.500
I'm the one that says I wanted the church and I

1092
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.500
wanted his ways, but the disconnect was just

1093
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:50.700
ridiculous.

1094
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.900
But he's faithful and he does draw.

1095
00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.600
And I think that's kind of shocking.

1096
00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.700
They can come after the liar

1097
00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:03.800
and the deceiver the seductress.

1098
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.400
the abuser

1099
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.500
and give them life.

1100
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.400
Maybe it came out of a an honest set of

1101
00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:13.800
needs.

1102
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.200
One of my earliest memories is trying to

1103
00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.500
look up the look up the skirt of my kindergarten teacher

1104
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.200
during nap time.

1105
00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:24.500
There was something in me.

1106
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.200
That was dark.

1107
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.000
Something in me that lived guilty.

1108
00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.600
Something in me that my conscience was.

1109
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.000
I was

1110
00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.300
Honestly, I was continually.

1111
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.500
disobeying my conscience

1112
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.000
By the time I was 11, I was fully sexually addicted.

1113
00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.600
My identity was being formed by my

1114
00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.000
Hunger for pornography.

1115
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.500
Pornography was the giving me images

1116
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.300
and giving me material to understand

1117
00:57:56.300 --> 00:58:00.400
Colonel knowledge in ways that formed me.

1118
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.100
Right alongside that thing happening in me.

1119
00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.300
Some horrible things were happening in my

1120
00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:08.800
family as well.

1121
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:13.700
my beautiful intact pretty secure family

1122
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:17.500
came under its own Warfare. My mom was diagnosed with

1123
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:20.500
a progressive form

1124
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:23.400
of multiple sclerosis sclerosis. And we

1125
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.900
lived with that from the time. I was seven years old until she

1126
00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:28.200
passed away when I was 50.

1127
00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.900
And fear entered into our household I was

1128
00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.500
so susceptible to fear.

1129
00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.600
The what I would do with the anxiety, what

1130
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.700
I would do with the pain is I would use.

1131
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.300
Those images that forbidden material those

1132
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.300
forbidden encounters to calm myself

1133
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:49.300
and soothe myself.

1134
00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.600
And it went on like that. I began to trace images

1135
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:57.800
out of the pornography that my dad had.

1136
00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:01.100
Was tracing paper and I kept it in a

1137
00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:04.800
little cigar box had my own private stash.

1138
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.500
And I kind of lived off of that material. I knew when

1139
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.100
I began to babysit. I knew where to find it in other

1140
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:11.700
people's homes.

1141
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.700
I I began to pursue

1142
00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.500
and look for that everywhere. I went.

1143
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:22.400
When I was 17, my dad was diagnosed.

1144
00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:26.500
With an aggressive form of cancer and I

1145
00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:26.800
lost him.

1146
00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.600
And that left me with a mother who was Ill

1147
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.700
fatherless?

1148
00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.900
My little sister two years younger than me, and

1149
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:38.500
I was on right on the cusp of

1150
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.300
graduating from call. I mean College High School.

1151
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:46.100
and so all of these pieces that the the things

1152
00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.400
that I was forming in myself and my hiddenness

1153
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.100
and Disobedience and the things that were being formed in me by

1154
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:52.500
my circumstances

1155
00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:56.700
were altering my perception of

1156
00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:56.900
myself.

1157
00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.300
I began to I began to have relationships with so

1158
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:05.100
many kinds of people different kinds of things encounters. Let's

1159
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.300
just call them all kinds of encounters. But

1160
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.400
by the time I was about 13, I I

1161
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.100
began to be very exclusive in what I

1162
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.100
preferred.

1163
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.200
And even though we didn't tend to

1164
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:18.500
label it.

1165
01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.600
Like kids are offered nowadays.

1166
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.200
At that time by my behavior. I would

1167
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.200
have said I was becoming

1168
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.000
a gay identified person. None of

1169
01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.300
that language was given to us.

1170
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.900
And maybe that was a mercy.

1171
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.400
So I lived in this identity this duality

1172
01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.500
of Christianity.

1173
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.900
and gay

1174
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.100
not ever calling it that wanting so

1175
01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.000
much the way of the Lord.

1176
01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:53.500
But the duplicity was starting to tear me apart. I

1177
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:53.800
dealt.

1178
01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:57.100
From the time I was really young with high levels

1179
01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:57.700
of anxiety.

1180
01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.000
inability to be consistent

1181
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.100
I would I would consistently fail at things I attempted to

1182
01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.200
do because anxiety would just overtake me.

1183
01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.800
My formation is in my Humanity was

1184
01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.400
weak.

1185
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:19.100
Now I'm going to just skip us several years because something miraculous

1186
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.500
happened.

1187
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.700
I was at Oklahoma Baptist University and I I had a

1188
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.800
couple of teachers who were mentoring me at the time.

1189
01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.500
Who who wanted me to

1190
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.700
embrace some of these?

1191
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.200
issues in my soul

1192
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.600
and so my writing teacher was giving me assignments to to

1193
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.200
Cull out the material that was going on

1194
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.000
inside of me.

1195
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.100
And I I was dismayed.

1196
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.500
At the identity that was emerging the truth of the thing that

1197
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.200
was emerging.

1198
01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.300
But at the same time there was a little church in South Oklahoma City

1199
01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:59.600
who had they had a radical prayer meeting.

1200
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.800
And so those crazy people on in

1201
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.400
the mornings would get up and they would face the

1202
01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:05.900
North

1203
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.500
From South Oklahoma City, they would pray for everybody up this

1204
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.100
way that they knew who needed salvation and they

1205
01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:15.100
would turn around in the church and face the South and pray for the people to

1206
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.600
the South. But when they faced East from South

1207
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.000
Oklahoma City they were praying for this girl.

1208
01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.500
in Shawnee, Oklahoma

1209
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.700
Who desperately needed the truth?

1210
01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.300
So imagine they're surprised I had no idea imagine. They're

1211
01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:34.800
surprised when a friend whose car

1212
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.800
broke down asked me for a ride to this church that

1213
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.500
was experiencing some level of a

1214
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.600
move of God. They had done crazy things like repent of

1215
01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.200
being a democracy nuts my friend

1216
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.000
wanted to see that she gave me a ride.

1217
01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.400
And the girl that they had been praying for walks into a South

1218
01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.200
Oklahoma City Church.

1219
01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.000
I heard them gasp.

1220
01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.700
I had no idea what it was about.

1221
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.500
But I the one that they had been praying for by name

1222
01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.400
was suddenly in their midst.

1223
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.100
and over the next

1224
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:13.500
I haven't told the story that way no before the

1225
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:16.000
one that was in their midst was suddenly in

1226
01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.800
a place to receive the Gospel truly

1227
01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.900
received the gospel.

1228
01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.600
And I heard I heard this good news.

1229
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.200
That the god that God reveals himself.

1230
01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.300
To people so that the truth of who he

1231
01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.600
is is revealed.

1232
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.500
And he calls us to repent.

1233
01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:40.600
Now I have a new definition for repentance. You

1234
01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.600
know, we always talked about doing the total

1235
01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.400
turnaround the 180 the about face.

1236
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.600
But you know the minute I turned toward

1237
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:50.900
God.

1238
01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.000
Sin was at my back.

1239
01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:56.500
now

1240
01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.500
I came to Faith I received forgiveness of sin.

1241
01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:04.200
But I did not have discipleship to help

1242
01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:04.900
me walk.

1243
01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.500
And so I floundered along for a

1244
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.800
few months and fell headlong into the one and

1245
01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.200
only long-term relationship.

1246
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.500
That I ever entered in after finally coming to Christ.

1247
01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:22.300
after finally knowing him it was like getting

1248
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.300
your foot caught and a snag.

1249
01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.800
And just pitching forward into the darkness.

1250
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.100
And for three years I lived in that relationship the Lord

1251
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.200
drawing me my anxiety getting higher the

1252
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.800
Lord drawing me. It was eating me up the

1253
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.400
duplicity in my heart. It was eating me up.

1254
01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:42.600
until

1255
01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.400
What was now 33 years

1256
01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.400
ago on January 27th?

1257
01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.600
I walked into a service.

1258
01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.400
And the the person testifying that

1259
01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.400
night gave an invitation. I wish I

1260
01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.800
could take your heart into my heart.

1261
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.300
I wish I could show you just how good it feels to

1262
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.200
let go over the things that you know are killing you.

1263
01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.000
And cling to the only one who could heal.

1264
01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:12.900
And while I didn't recognize myself in his homosexual testimony

1265
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.300
didn't recognize or even see that

1266
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.700
peace. I knew that I needed that. Peace.

1267
01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.100
And I came forward.

1268
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.600
Waiting for people to pray the junk off of me.

1269
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.300
and as I stood there waiting

1270
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:31.200
The knowledge of the holy God came on

1271
01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:31.400
me.

1272
01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:35.500
And I heard myself pray this prayer. I cannot save myself.

1273
01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.900
I need you to save me.

1274
01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.200
And over the next few days strangely.

1275
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.400
miraculously my girlfriend broke off the relationship

1276
01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.700
I didn't see that one coming.

1277
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.600
and I began to put together a little obediences first

1278
01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.100
one little obedience and then another

1279
01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.600
Titus talks about that too

1280
01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:00.600
this is

1281
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.400
it says

1282
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.100
to the pure all things are pure.

1283
01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.200
But to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing

1284
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.600
is pure but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.

1285
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.200
And then what I read you they profess to know God by

1286
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.000
their deeds. They they deny him.

1287
01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.400
Being detestable and disobedient worthless for

1288
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.800
any good deed and I began to agree with God.

1289
01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:33.000
It's like first Peter says, you know since then

1290
01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.600
in obedience to the truth.

1291
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.400
You purify your souls for the sincere love

1292
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.100
of the brethren.

1293
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.500
That is quite A discipleship move

1294
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:44.800
right there.

1295
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:46.700
You say you love?

1296
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.000
purify your souls

1297
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.500
and the Lord began to put together a history

1298
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.800
under my belt when I came to first stone to

1299
01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.400
serve in 1993. I didn't have any

1300
01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.900
language except the Bible.

1301
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.000
for recovery

1302
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.900
I only had Bible language for recovery

1303
01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.900
and I showed up at first stone and began

1304
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.300
to understand that some of the some of

1305
01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.100
the breakdown.

1306
01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:17.300
What what we call the rested development.

1307
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.700
There were there were real reasons that anxiety had come

1308
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.200
into my life.

1309
01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.000
And God had real answers for that ways to heal.

1310
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:29.200
You know, he doesn't fix your history. He can't

1311
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.400
go back and rewrite the history. But what happens

1312
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.500
is he reveals himself and he writes himself into

1313
01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.100
the history.

1314
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.000
He gives you a perspective that comes alongside and begins to

1315
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.100
feel that fill the gaps that never could have been

1316
01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.800
filled outside of that miracle.

1317
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:47.100
so

1318
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.500
the Lord did a good work in me keeps

1319
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.500
doing it. And I have a phrase that I say a lot. I'm not

1320
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.700
as free as I want to be.

1321
01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:01.200
In 2004, I married Mark Stanley. He's

1322
01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.500
pretty cool.

1323
01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.100
We're very different, but the lord gave me a vow.

1324
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.000
To vow at my wedding. I said Mark I will

1325
01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.500
live with my walls down and my

1326
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:13.900
heart open.

1327
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.500
I believe that the lord gave that to me so that over the course of

1328
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.700
my life. I would keep bringing those walls

1329
01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.500
down the defensive walls of hatred

1330
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.600
and pain and fear.

1331
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.000
And and to be open and the Lord

1332
01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.400
has used that both in relationship with Mark, but also

1333
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.000
in my relationship to the Lord.

1334
01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.600
Technology issue here. I

1335
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.500
don't know how it happened, but it happened.

1336
01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.400
So is it working now? Okay, there it goes. So there's

1337
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.200
Laura Lee's family Laura Lee

1338
01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.600
was she little girl Laura Lee once Christian

1339
01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.100
Broadcasting Network Laura Lee

1340
01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:06.200
redeemed in Ministry and Laura

1341
01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.800
Lee meeting. This

1342
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.800
guy. He's also really an awesome guy. We

1343
01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:14.200
like him and yeah, just

1344
01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.600
wanted to share that now, I think it's working again.

1345
01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:20.300
So yeah, we'll let you share

1346
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:23.100
you. This is Laura Beth Perry. She is an amazing

1347
01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.500
as Laura Beth Perry small snail.

1348
01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.900
You're going to find out about that.

1349
01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.600
So I

1350
01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.100
I was just so amazed as I sit here and listen to these stories

1351
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:40.300
that I've heard over and over again, but told in a slightly different way

1352
01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.900
each time and just the power of God in our stories.

1353
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.200
And you know, these aren't just stories you read

1354
01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.100
in a book, but well some of you read the book, but you know,

1355
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.000
God has really transformed Our Lives.

1356
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.200
And you know, I was one of those kids too. Like Joseph said I

1357
01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.300
grew up in the church. Every time the door was open we were involved in

1358
01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.300
every activity. I was in Bible drill and memorized a ton of scripture. I

1359
01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.600
was in Christian School heard about Jesus all the time, but I

1360
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.100
didn't know what I didn't know and I didn't know that I didn't know

1361
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:10.400
the Lord I knew about Jesus I knew about God and

1362
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.300
I knew a lot about the Bible, but I did not know him and I didn't know

1363
01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:17.100
that I didn't know that and I remember my at

1364
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:19.200
some point. I must have prayed some kind of prayer. I don't

1365
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.100
remember it. My parents don't remember it but I

1366
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.300
at some point had made some kind of confession of Faith

1367
01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:28.300
got baptized. I got baptized because my friend was getting

1368
01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:31.000
baptized and really grew up

1369
01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.400
hearing that I was a Christian and couldn't figure out and my

1370
01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.800
parents couldn't figure out why I had all these behavior problems.

1371
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.100
But I had all kinds of emotional problems. I was

1372
01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.400
I didn't have a close relationship with my mother for

1373
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.100
a variety of reasons. She had her own Brokenness and

1374
01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:49.200
struggles. She tells in her

1375
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.700
own testimony that the struggles and the anxiety and

1376
01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.400
the massive health problems. She had and all kinds

1377
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.200
of other things trying so hard to live as she put

1378
01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.300
it in her own words trying so hard to please God in

1379
01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.300
the power of her own flesh not understanding the power the

1380
01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.100
Holy Spirit to empower her to live the life that

1381
01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.300
he had called her to and as a result. She was stressed out. She was

1382
01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.400
burned out. I was born much later in life and a lot of times she

1383
01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.100
was just too stressed to handle me. So I was pushed toward

1384
01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:19.400
my dad and just told you know, you're just like your dad, you know,

1385
01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.600
you look like Amy act like him and as

1386
01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.100
a result, I really begin to detach from my mom

1387
01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.400
detach from the feminine. I did any I begin to hate my mother at

1388
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.400
a very young age. I wanted nothing to do with her and wasn't

1389
01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.800
close to my sister either for kind

1390
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.200
of similar reasons and then if but when

1391
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:37.300
I

1392
01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.300
A school and I began to hang out with other girls for

1393
01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:43.600
the first time. I didn't know how to relate to girls. They

1394
01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.100
were weird and awkward because I had spent all my

1395
01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:49.300
time with my dad and my brother and I really began to believe it

1396
01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:52.300
in very early age that I was not like girls.

1397
01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.300
I knew I was physically a girl but it didn't make any sense

1398
01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.400
to me. And so I

1399
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.400
You know just grew up acting like my brother. I spent

1400
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.100
all my time with him that I could I played with this toys. I wore

1401
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.200
his clothes and I tried to become my brother

1402
01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.200
and was so jealous of him growing up and

1403
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.300
other boys and I spent all my time playing with boys, and I

1404
01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.900
was very athletic. So I fit in very well with the boys at school.

1405
01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.300
But then as I got older and began to realize that

1406
01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:23.100
I I was different from the boys as well. I just

1407
01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:24.300
didn't know where I fit in.

1408
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.400
I was molested by another boy when I was eight. I became

1409
01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.100
very sexual became very confused hiding a

1410
01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:34.300
lot of dark secrets and then when I got into high school was trying

1411
01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.700
to find love in all the wrong places. I had an extensive

1412
01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:38.600
sexual past.

1413
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.300
Trying so hard to fix the Brokenness inside and

1414
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.200
I didn't know how trying so hard to be loved and accepted and

1415
01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.200
I hated myself and I couldn't figure out why

1416
01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.100
I couldn't be a good enough girl what I was no matter what I

1417
01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.600
gave to men because I kept thinking if I'd give them everything that ever

1418
01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.300
wanted then they would want me but I was dumped and

1419
01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.900
rejected and abused and used just over and over and over again.

1420
01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.200
And I finally looked back on my life

1421
01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:06.300
and I was like, you know, the reason this never works out. The reason I'm never happy

1422
01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:09.200
is because I was supposed to be the man if I

1423
01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.300
was a man. I know how to treat a woman and so

1424
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.100
I began to fantasize night and day about what this would look like

1425
01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:18.300
if I could become a man and I'd still never heard the

1426
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.300
word transgender. I mean, this was 2007. I can't believe how

1427
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.300
much the cultures changed but I

1428
01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.500
Began to look this up. And so I I went and

1429
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.500
sought out people that felt like I did and I

1430
01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.200
thought this was the answer to everything. So I was so excited

1431
01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.400
and I began to just run down that path. I began to

1432
01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.000
medically transition with hormones. I eventually had my breasts

1433
01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.500
removed. I eventually had a hysterectomy and had the

1434
01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:45.200
ovaries removed and begin to really look like

1435
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:48.400
a man my body began to change my voice began to get lower again

1436
01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.400
facial hair and all this time. I really started

1437
01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.300
to believe that I was becoming a man.

1438
01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.100
But inside of his tormented and haunted because I knew

1439
01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.600
that I was living a lie, and no matter how much the outside changed. I

1440
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.400
was reminded every single day that all of

1441
01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.800
this was fake that I was making the outside look like

1442
01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.100
a man but inside I knew that

1443
01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:12.200
I was living a lie, and I was reminded of the

1444
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.200
truth all the time and I it was

1445
01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.500
still better in my mind at the time than living as a woman because there

1446
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.500
was so much pain I had because of the abuse I'd suffered

1447
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.400
from men I felt so

1448
01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.300
Worthless as a woman I felt like I had no value

1449
01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.400
as a woman. So I didn't want anything to do

1450
01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.100
with being a woman but the Lord began to pursue me

1451
01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:36.100
and he began to draw me and

1452
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.300
I didn't want to be drawn. I had rejected God. I told God I would never serve

1453
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.400
him again, but I began to he began to draw me

1454
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.400
through my parents' prayers through prayers of people in the church, and I

1455
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.700
found myself one day.

1456
01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:52.300
Just had a huge revelation of my own sin. And I had seen

1457
01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:56.100
the Lord just transform my mom and I I

1458
01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.100
wanted what she had. I had seen

1459
01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:01.200
the real power of God in her life went home

1460
01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.200
and began to confess everything I could think of and the Lord

1461
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.500
encountered me and I had this radical transformation and

1462
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.100
I gave my life to the Lord with all my heart and I was going to

1463
01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:13.400
be a man of God and I was excited because I

1464
01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.600
thought this is awesome. I can be a

1465
01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:19.300
man of God now and I don't have to go back to that female identity. But

1466
01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:22.600
now I can have peace with God and but God

1467
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.500
didn't leave me there he gave me an incredible hunger for the word and

1468
01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.300
as I begin to really pursue the Lord with

1469
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:31.200
all my heart he began to convict me and as he began

1470
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.200
to convict Me Slowly little by little over a year and a

1471
01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.600
half. I couldn't ignore the conviction anymore

1472
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.400
and got basically brought

1473
01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.300
this this first to my heart that

1474
01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:46.400
says if anyone will come after me let him deny himself and

1475
01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.900
take up his cross and follow me for whoever will

1476
01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:51.300
His life shall lose it but whoever loses his life

1477
01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:54.100
from my sexual find it for what does it profit a man to

1478
01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.400
gain the whole world and yet forfeit his own soul, or what

1479
01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.700
shall I give an exchange for his soul?

1480
01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.100
And I finally agreed with the Lord. I didn't

1481
01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:05.200
want to this actually was over the course of several months. I was so

1482
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.300
convicted. I beg the Lord to just take my life because I did not

1483
01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.500
see a way out. I had absolutely no hope of transformation but

1484
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.400
I finally decided that I had to obey the

1485
01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.600
Lord. I thought I'd be miserable the rest of my life. But

1486
01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.500
as I begin to agree with God over the truth

1487
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:23.500
of how he created me as I began to believe his word

1488
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:26.500
and as I begin to forgive my mom and I forget began to

1489
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.300
forgive those that hurt me as God began to bring healing to all

1490
01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:32.100
those things as I begin to let go of all the

1491
01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:35.600
envy and the jealousy and the bitterness and all those things that have been sewn into

1492
01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.300
that identity for years. God begin to

1493
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:41.600
bring a radical transformation in me. I begin to really embrace

1494
01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.300
my feminine and identity. I finally begin to love being

1495
01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:47.400
a woman for the first time in my life and then a little

1496
01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:50.100
over a year ago. God brought an incredible man into my

1497
01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:53.600
life continue to bring some just incredible healing

1498
01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.600
and we were married last May. This is

1499
01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.200
my husband Perry.

1500
01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.100
oh, yeah, so when I was

1501
01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.100
several months before I left the lifestyle I had

1502
01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.800
really the

1503
01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:17.500
The conviction I was Hunter was incredible because they the

1504
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.100
ladies and my mom's Bible say we're praying that I would have a

1505
01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.300
ravenous hunger for the word in us when I heard that I just laughed

1506
01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:26.400
I said, he'll do not know how much God answered that prayer. I was

1507
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.500
literally listening to some kind of Christian teaching or

1508
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.400
audio Bible hours and hours and hours a day at work and

1509
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.600
God was pouring his word into me. And I finally out

1510
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.100
the fear of the Lord really hit me and I got down on my

1511
01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.100
knees and I began to cry out to God with all my heart. I said God I

1512
01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:44.700
want everything you have for me. I don't want to miss anything. What

1513
01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:45.500
do you want from me?

1514
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.700
In the Lord asked me a question. See I was actually expecting God

1515
01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:52.500
to say I want you to do this this thing like give me a checklist.

1516
01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.700
I had to accomplish in my life.

1517
01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:57.300
And the Lord's asked me he said if you stood before me tonight, what

1518
01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:57.900
name would I call?

1519
01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.500
And I didn't like that very much because I had heard God calling

1520
01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.700
me Laura and my prayers and I tried to pretend he wasn't.

1521
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:08.300
As I said, oh God, that's not fair. I I said I Repent

1522
01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.200
of this I said I was sorry. I know this wasn't your will but I can't

1523
01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.400
go back now. I have you know, all this facial hair.

1524
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.800
I've had all these surgeries. I've had all these legal changes. Everybody here

1525
01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.100
knows me as a man. I had a job where I was only known as

1526
01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:21.400
male I can't go back.

1527
01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.200
And the Lord reminded me of John chapter 1 where it says Jesus Christ

1528
01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.400
himself is the Creator and he said you cannot claim to

1529
01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.200
love me and yet reject my creation.

1530
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.200
And I thought I was being condemned because I was not going to go back to being a

1531
01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.800
woman. It's like Lord. That's just not gonna happen.

1532
01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.200
And in the most loving voice I've ever heard in all my

1533
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.200
life the Lord whispered to me and he said let me tell you who you

1534
01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:45.500
are.

1535
01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:50.400
And that's really what began to free me not at that moment because it's not like at

1536
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.100
that moment. I went. Oh, yes God that is right. It was

1537
01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:56.100
that's when I really started asking the Lord to take my life because I

1538
01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.600
said God that just cannot happen. There is no way out.

1539
01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:03.100
But really it began and it was what you've heard in several

1540
01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.100
of our stories that it really came down to the point where it's like

1541
01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.800
I want Jesus more than I want my next breath.

1542
01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.300
And as I've continued to walk with the lord, it's been

1543
01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:14.200
one of them, you know, the most difficult things I've ever done but

1544
01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.200
yet he's been so faithful through it all. I'm so incredibly

1545
01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.100
grateful to the Lord.

1546
01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.400
I I just want to finish up with

1547
01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.400
the testimonies of the Lord

1548
01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.800
make wise the simple.

1549
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.300
I I listen to this all the time and I never

1550
01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:50.100
get tired of hearing it. I I hope you've been affected by

1551
01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:50.600
the fact.

1552
01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.200
The culture and the world is telling us one thing

1553
01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:54.600
folks.

1554
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:02.200
This is the truth.

1555
01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:05.900
It is.

1556
01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:07.800
forever

1557
01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.400
settled in heaven

1558
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:14.300
and this is our goal. This is

1559
01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.500
the the place that we go.

1560
01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.200
in all different Church backgrounds

1561
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:24.300
But you know, what's interesting about I think all of us maybe Joseph

1562
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.100
Goodman and I but all of us have been

1563
01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.000
touched by the Southern Baptist Church.

1564
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.600
and the standard

1565
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:33.200
is this

1566
01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.500
and so I just want to say thank you for allowing us

1567
01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.400
to come and share.

1568
01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.400
I hope you heard that we're all about this.

1569
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.800
And a relationship that is completely surrendered to

1570
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.200
Jesus as Lord because then he

1571
01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.300
saves and delivers and sets us free. We have

1572
01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:54.700
all that literature out there and books and

1573
01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:58.000
stuff. So want to please Avail yourself

1574
01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:00.600
of that and thank you and God

1575
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.500
bless you.

1576
01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:04.800
Pastor okay, you're dismissed.
