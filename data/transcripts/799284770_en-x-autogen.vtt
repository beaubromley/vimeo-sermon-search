1
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.100
Good evening.

2
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.600
We'll try that one more time. It's cold.

3
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.400
It's raining. I don't I don't fault you for not saying it

4
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.200
the way you should have. All right. Here we

5
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.600
go. Good evening.

6
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.000
Thank you. Well, I'm not gonna spend a lot

7
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.600
of time up here because we have to get from Moses until the apocalypse

8
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.700
tonight. And so I'm

9
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.600
excited about it. But you're a

10
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.300
guest tonight. We want to say welcome. We don't believe it's an accident

11
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.300
that you're here. If you came in the rain, you're our kind of people and I

12
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.200
was going to introduce Dr. Emerson as

13
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.700
the weatherman tonight because every time he comes there's snow or ice or

14
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.400
rain or fog or whatever, but I'm

15
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.800
glad that he's here. I'm sad that we only get him three nights, but

16
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.500
let's pray together and then I'll welcome Dr. Men father.

17
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.400
Thank you so much for your word and how it

18
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.800
challenges Us and how it teaches us Lord instruct us

19
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.100
tonight father to know how to read it for all

20
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.700
it's worth Lord it is

21
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.700
It is.

22
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.600
Sweeter than honeycomb.

23
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.100
And and it is great reward. And so I

24
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.000
pray father tonight. We would we would taste it sweetness, but we

25
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.300
would also see its reward. Thank you for Dr. Emerson for his

26
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.600
willingness to come and Lord. I pray that that tonight

27
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.400
you will guide him in his steps in his words and

28
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.700
it's in Jesus and we pray amen.

29
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.100
Well, thanks Phil. Thanks for having me and inviting me.

30
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.900
It's been a blessing to be with you the last month or

31
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.300
so. I do I do regret that

32
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.900
we couldn't meet the second week.

33
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.600
I guess I'm either the weatherman or the post

34
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.500
office because I'm here.

35
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.300
Rain or shine ice or snow whatever, but it

36
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.800
has been fun.

37
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.900
I I'm gonna have to use a cheat sheet tonight.

38
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.900
Because we have so much to cover. The good news is the cheat

39
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.100
sheet is in the Bible.

40
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200
So if you want to turn your Bible.

41
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.000
To Psalm 78 Psalm 78

42
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.800
is going to help us summarize.

43
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.100
Pretty much the entire rest of Israel's history.

44
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.500
And I'll still walk you through the the

45
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.400
books in terms of mentioning them and mentioning the

46
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.200
story and following what we've talked about so far, but Psalm

47
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.900
78 will help us as we begin and the

48
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.900
Lord.

49
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.600
Helped me yesterday. This was actually the reading yesterday from the

50
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.400
Psalms and I thought hey, this will be helpful tomorrow

51
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
night. So that was in the Lord's good Providence

52
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.500
to have that ready so Psalm 78.

53
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.300
a mask goal of asaph

54
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.700
give ear o my people to my teaching incline your

55
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.900
ears to the words of my mouth.

56
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.700
I will open my mouth in a parable. I will

57
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.500
utter dark sayings from of old things that

58
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.500
we have heard and known that our fathers have told us.

59
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.400
We will not hide them from their children, but tell to their

60
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.400
coming Generation The Glorious Deeds of the Lord and his might

61
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.900
and the Wonders that he has done.

62
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.600
He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a

63
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.400
law in Israel when he commanded our fathers to

64
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.700
teach their children that the Next Generation might know them the children

65
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.900
yet unborn and arise and tell them to their children so

66
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.300
they should set their hope in God and not forget the

67
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.300
works of God, but keep his Commandments and that

68
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.900
they should not be like their father is a stubborn and rebellious generation a

69
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.700
generation whose heart was not steadfast.

70
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.300
Whose Spirit was not faithful to God?

71
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.200
The ephraimites armed with the bow turned back on the day of battle.

72
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.400
They did not keep God's covenant, but refused to walk according to

73
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.300
his law they forgot his works and the Wonders

74
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.200
that he had shown them in the sight of their fathers. He performed

75
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.800
wonders in the land of Egypt in the fields of Zohan.

76
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.100
He divided the sea and let them pass through it and made the water

77
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.300
stand like a heap in the daytime. He led them with a

78
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.300
cloud and all the night with a fiery light. He split rocks

79
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.000
in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.

80
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.500
He made streams come out of the Rock and caused Waters to

81
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.400
flow down like Rivers.

82
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.500
And here's one of the key verses for at

83
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.700
least for the rest of the Old Testament yet. They send still more

84
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.300
against him.

85
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.200
Rebelling against the most high in the desert. They tested

86
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.400
God in their heart by demanding the food they

87
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.000
craved.

88
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.300
They spoke against God saying can God spread a

89
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.000
table in the wilderness.

90
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.400
He struck the rock. So the water gushed out and streams overflowed.

91
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.000
Can he also give bread or provide meat for

92
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.300
his people?

93
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.800
Therefore when the Lord heard he was full of Wrath a

94
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.700
fire was kindled against Jacob his anger Rose

95
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.100
against Israel because they did not believe in God

96
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.000
and did not trust his saving power.

97
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.800
Now we could keep reading in Psalm 78.

98
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.300
It's pretty much the same thing.

99
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.400
two or three more times

100
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.200
And what happens after where we ended last

101
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.000
week is that God calls Israel out of Egypt?

102
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.400
Remember we're following along in this Grand story

103
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.200
where God has promised through his

104
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.400
promises to Abraham to restore what Adam lost.

105
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.500
That at some point he's going to fulfill his purpose for

106
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.900
creation that his image Bears will fill the Earth will be

107
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.700
fruitful multiply. Obey care and Rule

108
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.600
and how he's going to do that. We've just seen in

109
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.400
Exodus is through the death of the firstborn son the

110
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.800
blood of the Lamb rescuing his people from their enemies.

111
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.500
So God has rescued his people where we ended last week.

112
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.600
And the next thing he does he says, all right. Let's go to my place.

113
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.700
You're my people.

114
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.900
We're going to go to my place.

115
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.300
Brings them out of Egypt.

116
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.500
through the Red Sea

117
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.100
the way that they crossed the Red Sea is how does he do that? He Parts

118
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.900
the waters. He separates the waters and

119
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.200
they walk across on dry land. Does that remind you

120
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.500
of anything that we talked about from week one, right God on

121
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.700
day.

122
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.700
three separated the waters

123
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.200
There was a dry land same things happening with

124
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.500
Israel. It's New Creation language saying they have Noah. All

125
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.100
right, they go across.

126
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.500
Immediately and this is part of what Psalm 78 just described at

127
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.200
the end that we read immediately. First of

128
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.500
all, even before they crossed the Red Sea. What does Israel do they get

129
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.100
to the Red Sea?

130
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.100
And they're like, oh God's got us. We're all good. No.

131
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.200
They start freaking out.

132
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.200
What are we going to do?

133
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.200
Here's this body of water. We can't cross.

134
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.600
Egypt's Army is coming right behind us to destroy us

135
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.000
all and they say let's just go back.

136
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.300
Like maybe Pharaoh will not be mad if we just turn around

137
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.100
and like hey, sorry.

138
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.100
Moses Parts the waters, they go across

139
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.300
now remember when they do that what have they just seen God do

140
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.900
They just saw with their own eyes.

141
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.800
all ten plagues

142
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.000
and God rescuing them from the 10th and

143
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.700
final plague through the blood of the Lamb.

144
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.900
They just saw all that they just saw them. They themselves

145
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.300
took gold and silver and even

146
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.800
Egyptians are following them out of Egypt because they see this

147
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.900
God the god of Israel is the true God and immediately.

148
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.400
when they face

149
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.900
a question, how are we going to cross this water?

150
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.600
They turn to fear and doubt.

151
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.300
Nevertheless God brings them across through the

152
00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:58.600
waters.

153
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.000
on the dry land

154
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.400
the Egyptians are the Egyptian Army's killed

155
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.900
in the water coming after them.

156
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.200
Go through the water kind of like Noah's flood. They go through the water come across immediately.

157
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.400
Once they get across Moses sings. This

158
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.200
great song about God is an awesome God and his great

159
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.300
and he has all these armies and he can destroy anybody. He's just provided

160
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.000
Victory Moses is up here praising and worshiping the Lord.

161
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.100
And the Israelites immediately, what do they say?

162
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.500
God we don't have any water to drink.

163
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.200
It's bitter.

164
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.000
And so God is like hey.

165
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.200
Okay.

166
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.200
You guys remember what just happened but fine. Here's some here's some water you

167
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:41.400
can drink.

168
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.400
And what it says is in Exodus 16 that

169
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.200
he gave them the water to drink, but he also gave them a

170
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.600
rule and a statute.

171
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.700
when Israel sins

172
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.400
God is gracious to them and present to them but he also gives them a

173
00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.600
law.

174
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:01.600
then

175
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.800
what happens next they complain?

176
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.000
Thanks for the water God, but now we ain't got nothing to eat.

177
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.200
Pharaoh might have been literally killing us with the

178
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.400
work. He was having us do.

179
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.000
But he also fed us.

180
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.100
Now we got no food. What's up with that God. Let's just go back to Egypt.

181
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.000
God says fine.

182
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.600
Here's Manna From Heaven. He gives them what they crave.

183
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.400
Gives them what they ask for but he also then gives them another

184
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.400
Rule and statute. They sin the

185
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.400
complain they doubt they have they lack faith. God is

186
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.100
gracious to them in providing for them. But he

187
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.800
also follows that up with giving them a law.

188
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.700
Eventually, they get to Mount Sinai in Exodus

189
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.000
19.

190
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.400
And at this point God says come up on the mountain with

191
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:53.500
me.

192
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.500
in Israel's like

193
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.600
yeah.

194
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.500
And God says you know what you're right.

195
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.400
You guys are a bunch of sinful.

196
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.200
doubtful

197
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.400
I want to say jackwagons, but God doesn't

198
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.100
say that he just says look, yeah, don't come up

199
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.200
here. Don't even touch the mountain.

200
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.200
Here's what I'll do instead. I will come down to you.

201
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.100
Instead of you coming up to me, which is what he says to them at first

202
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.000
come up on the mountain.

203
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.700
be

204
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.100
a kingdom of priests

205
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.000
a royal Nation a royal priesthood a holy nation

206
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.100
come up on this mountain with me in my place.

207
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.000
That I have made for you and live with me.

208
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.200
And Israel says Nah, and God's

209
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.200
like yeah, you're right. Don't even touch the mountain.

210
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.200
And he gives them more law at this point and the law that he begins

211
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.100
to give them is first of all the Ten Commandments.

212
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.100
And then he gives them the laws regarding the

213
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.600
priesthood and the Tabernacle.

214
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.400
So, okay Israel. Don't come up here anymore. Don't even

215
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.500
touch the mountain but here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make it I'm

216
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.700
gonna make there be a way

217
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.300
since you won't come up here and be a kingdom of priests.

218
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.200
I will make you a kingdom with priests and I will come down

219
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.500
to you.

220
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.200
So they were supposed to go up on the mountain and like Adam and Eve dwell

221
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.100
directly with God.

222
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.400
They're sinful though. They say no thanks. God says, yeah, you're

223
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.000
right. Not that he not that. He didn't know that already, but he

224
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.900
confirms what they know about themselves.

225
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.700
And he gives them a kingdom with priests.

226
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.600
now there are priests that mediate that come between

227
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.400
God and Israel

228
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.100
And so he gives them the Priestly laws and

229
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.300
the Tabernacle Tabernacle laws. He gives those to Moses who's up

230
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.000
on the mountain with God. So God says to Moses come up on the mountain. I'll give

231
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.300
you these laws most like all right goes up on the mountain right and

232
00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.600
things down.

233
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:01.700
in the meantime

234
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.600
What's Israel doing?

235
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.600
They're dancing naked.

236
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.100
Around a golden cow.

237
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.500
Which is not the same thing, by the way as the Bison

238
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.200
statue in the middle of OBS campus. Okay, there's not the

239
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.700
same thing. Well, they're dancing naked around this golden calf.

240
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.100
They not only have they rejected God's invitation to

241
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.600
come up on the mountain with him. They are now worshiping a false god.

242
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.500
While he's giving them laws.

243
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.700
About how he can be present to them still.

244
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.400
At this point what we've seen is more sin more law

245
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.500
more sin more law. That's the pattern so

246
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:45.700
far.

247
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.000
at this point

248
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.300
God understandably says I'm done.

249
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.900
Moses intercedes on their behalf

250
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.700
and he says you know what? I'm a God.

251
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.300
I'm The God Who will show Mercy on whom I'll show

252
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:05.600
Mercy.

253
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.000
And I will execute judgment on whom I will execute judgment and he

254
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.900
chooses to have mercy on Israel.

255
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.500
And the reason you know, the reason why he chooses have

256
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.800
mercy is because and Moses reminds him of this.

257
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.500
As does I mean Abraham reminds him of his Covenant

258
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.500
Moses reminds him of his Covenant. They remind him of the promises

259
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.000
that he's made not that he didn't know him already.

260
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.500
But through the prayers of these leaders.

261
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.400
God remembers his promises to his people and

262
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.200
The most important promise he remembers is the promise of

263
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.700
the seed.

264
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.500
If he destroys Israel on the spot what happens to

265
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.400
the line of the seed?

266
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.100
It's gone.

267
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.900
God remembers his promise so

268
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.100
at that point after Exodus 34

269
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.400
at that point from Exodus 34:35ish.

270
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.600
Through the Book of Leviticus, which is everybody's favorite

271
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.100
book of the Bible through Deuteronomy.

272
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.300
Or through numbers, excuse me through numbers 10 so last few

273
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.500
chapters of Exodus all of Leviticus.

274
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.300
First portion of the Book of Numbers Israel is

275
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.500
sitting at the foot of the mountain and God is just giving them law

276
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.600
after law after law after law after

277
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:23.900
law.

278
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.200
And finally in numbers 10, he says, all right. We're ready to go

279
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:29.400
now.

280
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.900
We're gonna go from Mount Sinai.

281
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.000
to the promised land

282
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.100
they get to their they get ready to go into the Promised Land.

283
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.000
The Israelites say wait a minute. We don't want to

284
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.600
go in yet.

285
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.100
We want to check it out first.

286
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:48.600
remember

287
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.600
They just saw God.

288
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.100
Do what?

289
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.300
kill all them people back there

290
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.600
bring them through the water.

291
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.700
Set them up with food and water in the wilderness.

292
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.500
Park them at the base of a mountain Thunder's rolling

293
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.800
lightning flashing.

294
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.000
Hang on God. We don't know if we really trust you.

295
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.800
to go into this place

296
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.800
So these are I'd say wait before we go in listen 12 Spies.

297
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.000
Charles spice come back only two Joshua and Caleb report.

298
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.200
Yeah, we can go in God's got us.

299
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.100
We're good the other 10 are like no we're afraid.

300
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.000
And this is the irony of that and this is

301
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.200
going to be an irony throughout the historical books the irony of

302
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.300
that.

303
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.200
the irony of Israel doubting

304
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.900
right in front of the Red Sea the irony of the spies doubting

305
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.700
right here the irony of the people in Joshua

306
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.200
and especially in judges fearing and doubting.

307
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.700
The irony of that is that when God gives Israel

308
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.000
the law and especially the laws that have to

309
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.900
do with the conquest going into the land and conquering it. The irony.

310
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.400
Is that what God says is

311
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.600
I'm going before you and these nations will fear and

312
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.000
tremble at my sight.

313
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.500
and instead

314
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.100
At the banks of the Red Sea at the base of

315
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.500
Mount Sinai and at the edge of the promised land.

316
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.500
It is Israel God's people who respond

317
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.000
with fear and anxiety and doubt.

318
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.400
And God says at that point when the ten

319
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:25.900
spies come back.

320
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.000
I'm out.

321
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.500
I'm done with this generation.

322
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.200
That generation wanders in the wilderness for 40 years. There's all kinds of

323
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.400
stuff that happens like the fiery serpent, which is important, but we don't

324
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.200
have to talk about it. They wander in the wilderness.

325
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.500
For 40 years, they eventually die off and then

326
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.200
what does God do once again?

327
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.400
more law

328
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.100
Deuteronomy

329
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.300
Same law that he already gave.

330
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.200
But this time it's to the second generation the generation that didn't witness The

331
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.800
Exodus.

332
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.700
that didn't

333
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.100
you know, they weren't adults essentially at Sinai.

334
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.400
And so it gives them the law again.

335
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.700
and it's very clear in the law in Deuteronomy that

336
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.300
Israel is called to the same thing.

337
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.600
That Adam and Eve were called to do and that Abraham was

338
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.200
called to do and that God promised to do through the Seed of Abraham.

339
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.600
They were supposed to go and be fruitful multiply rule over

340
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.300
God's place the Promised Land.

341
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.600
They were supposed to go in and care for the place.

342
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.000
And ultimately they were going to do all of that through obedience to

343
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.800
God's word that he gave them.

344
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.900
But they go into the land.

345
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.200
And if you read Joshua and judges back to back

346
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.700
what you'll find is that Joshua has some positive

347
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.600
things to say, but there's hints of failure

348
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.300
along the way so that by the end of the book you see that

349
00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.400
this was actually a failure.

350
00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.400
We read the book of Joshua and it sort of triumphant in the beginning and yeah,

351
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.100
we're gonna go get it. But by the end of the book If you read through the

352
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:03.600
whole book,

353
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.300
What you find is that over and over again the author

354
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.100
says and the Philistines were still in the

355
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.300
land and the Philistines were still in the land and the

356
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.300
Philistines were still in the land and the Philistines were still

357
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:16.600
in the land.

358
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.600
Israel was supposed to go in and as a

359
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.900
means of God's judgment against those Nations put the

360
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.100
ban on them destroy them.

361
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.500
And instead Israel goes in and this is in the Book of Joshua,

362
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.200
but we see it especially in judges in the Book of Joshua and

363
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.300
judges they go in and they don't do what God Said.

364
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.700
They don't keep themselves from idols.

365
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.100
They don't follow his rules.

366
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.500
About the forbidden fruit in this case. It's not fruit. It's people.

367
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.100
They're not by the way really fast. I got to make

368
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:52.600
this really fast.

369
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.500
Joshua and judges do not teach

370
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:57.900
a kind of

371
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.300
Ethnic superiority of anybody.

372
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.500
Okay, the reason that God sends Israel into destroy

373
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.500
the Canaanites is not because of some

374
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.200
kind of ethnic or racist issue

375
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.500
The reason that God sends Israel to destroy the Canaanites has

376
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.200
nothing to do it that's necessity or race at all. It has to do with the sinfulness of

377
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.300
the people in the land and God uses Israel as an

378
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.400
instrument for judgment. He does the same thing later on with

379
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.200
Babylon and with Assyria as an instrument of judgment against Israel.

380
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.500
In Joshua and judges in the whole Old

381
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.300
Testament salvation is never an issue of net

382
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.200
ethnicity or race.

383
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.200
Judgment is never an issue of ethnicity or

384
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.500
race in those books. The issue is whether or not you place

385
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.200
your faith in the one true God of the universe Yahweh.

386
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.200
That's it.

387
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.800
And if you do you're saved if you don't you're judged.

388
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.100
That's it.

389
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.300
And what we see in Joshua is Israel is being judged.

390
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.300
For failing to follow God's law and for failing to exercise

391
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.100
faith in Yahweh. So you think you know for some

392
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.700
of you who know, Joshua will the story of Aiken?

393
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.700
Aiken was supposed to put the ban.

394
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.000
On the city of AI you're supposed to help destroy it.

395
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.600
Everybody was supposed to help destroy it they were supposed to.

396
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.000
Destroy everything and Aiken keeps a little

397
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.600
bit to himself he touches what's forbidden just like Eve did.

398
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.600
And what God does is he puts the Judgment that

399
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.300
was reserved for AI onto Aiken in his

400
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:33.400
clan.

401
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.600
God is Not partial with respect to ethnicity

402
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.100
or race.

403
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.500
His judgment is for all those who reject him

404
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.300
his salvation is for all those who trust in

405
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:46.600
him.

406
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.500
So we get through Joshua and it's like super cool at

407
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.200
the beginning and then by the end, we're like, oh wait, maybe you guys didn't do such

408
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.200
a good job and then judges pulls the curtain back and says,

409
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.500
yeah everybody really really was terrible the entire

410
00:22:59.500 --> 00:22:59.800
time.

411
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.000
You know, I don't want to like fly by the

412
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.200
seat, you know the seat here and trample on

413
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.700
everybody's favorite bible stories, but like Gideon.

414
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.500
Dude, Gideon is actually an example. Yes in some

415
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.300
ways of Faith but in a lot of ways of doubt.

416
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.100
God tells him very clearly what to do

417
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.400
and he's like wait a minute. Hang on God.

418
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.600
Let me just check that real fast.

419
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.800
Can we do a quality check here? Make sure I heard you right.

420
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.200
He doesn't over and over and by the end of the story of

421
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.500
Gideon Gideon is actually.

422
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.700
Associated with idle worship like Gideon is

423
00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.800
not a guy who is faithful all

424
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.700
the way through but neither was Abraham.

425
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.400
Neither was Noah neither was Moses. I mean all of these men and

426
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.100
women in the Old Testament that are portrayed here.

427
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.300
What we need to see is that yes, there are signs that

428
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.500
God is moving Among Us people there are signs of faithfulness among

429
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.300
them. But ultimately everybody's failing left and right.

430
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.300
And remember what we're what we're wanting to see out

431
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.800
of that is that none of them?

432
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.100
None of them are who who are waiting on?

433
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.100
the seed

434
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.200
none of them are the seed.

435
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.500
They kind of look like the seed.

436
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.100
Not the seed.

437
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.700
We got through Genesis and we said well Joshua was the

438
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.300
looks the most like it, but he wasn't in the land. He didn't crush

439
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.200
the head of the serpent.

440
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.500
He died.

441
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.100
We get to Moses.

442
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.300
Moses isn't from the tribe of Judah first of all, so that's like

443
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.200
you're out already, but then he like kills a

444
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.000
guy with a trident and all kinds of stuff and you're out.

445
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.800
You look like it, but you're not it.

446
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.300
In Deuteronomy before I get too

447
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.900
far along and Deuteronomy Moses adds an expectation.

448
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.400
In Deuteronomy 18 and then Deuteronomy 34 Moses adds

449
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.500
the expectation that there will be a prophet greater than Moses that

450
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:04.700
comes.

451
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.500
So now we're looking for the seed of Adam

452
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.500
seed of Eve.

453
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.800
Line of Abraham Prophet greater than Moses. And

454
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.200
here's where Joshua and judges come in. Joshua looks

455
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:17.900
like it for a while.

456
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.900
And then you get to Ai, and it's like, whoops.

457
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.300
not Joshua

458
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.200
You get to the end of the Book of Joshua the Philistines the Philistines the Philistines the

459
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.100
Philistines not Joshua.

460
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.800
You get to judges and it's like any you people.

461
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.000
You all read the Book of Judges lately like it is crazy and

462
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.100
then

463
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.400
we get to and I mean things are so bad.

464
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.600
by the end of judges

465
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.100
that here's what happens at the end

466
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:48.800
of the Book of Judges.

467
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.200
One Tribe of Israel

468
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.700
The Tribe of Benjamin has committed an atrocity so

469
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.100
great.

470
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.300
And I don't I'm not going to go into the details because it would I just

471
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.400
don't want to bring it up at the moment without having the time

472
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.200
to spend on it.

473
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.400
The Tribe of Benjamin commits an atrocity so great. It's

474
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.500
worse than Sodom and Gomorrah like the author portrays this

475
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.800
event like Sodom and Gomorrah, but worse

476
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.600
here is a tribe of Israel that is worse than

477
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600
the worst cities.

478
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.100
in Genesis

479
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.100
and God calls Judah.

480
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.600
to lead Israel and putting the ban on Benjamin

481
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.000
Israel has been told go into the land and destroy all

482
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.100
of the Nations there.

483
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.300
Don't make a pact with them don't leave any

484
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.500
of them alive. Don't take their stuff go in and

485
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:45.800
destroy it.

486
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.300
And they fail and they fail so miserably.

487
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.200
That at the end of Judges we see and really actually

488
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.300
the story takes place at the beginning of the conquest. So

489
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.300
the author of Judges goes back all the way to the beginning and says, hey

490
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.500
this was always the case.

491
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.300
At the end of the book he tells this story where Benjamin has

492
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.500
done something so bad that it's worse than the Nations. They're

493
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.100
supposed to be destroying and God says, you know what you're

494
00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.900
gonna get destroyed.

495
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.600
You deserve judgment.

496
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.600
But what did Judah did you know how this ends?

497
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.300
Judah and the other tribes of Israel like the end of the book is they're

498
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:27.700
all just like

499
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:30.700
we're tired of fighting.

500
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.200
Let's just kind of stand here and look at each other. I mean seriously, that's

501
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.100
literally the end of the book.

502
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.700
So nobody's obeyed God nobody.

503
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.400
The Nations around them aren't obeying God. The Israelites aren't

504
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.200
obeying. God. Nobody's obeying God.

505
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.200
And in the book like man, where is the Hope here?

506
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.500
Like we've gone through.

507
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.600
and we punctuated this a number of times right you

508
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.400
get to Genesis 11 and you're like well

509
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.400
Where's the Hope Abraham?

510
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.200
promises Dave Ram

511
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.900
you get to Exodus 34 and the golden calf and you go.

512
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.300
Where's the hope?

513
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.000
God remembers his promises you get to the end

514
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.800
of judges and you're like man this this has got to be it like these people are terrible. I

515
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.000
agree with you god. Everybody needs to be destroyed.

516
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.200
And then we jump into first Samuel in the first story is the

517
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.300
story of of Hannah and her prayer and there's there's

518
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.200
these punctuations of faithfulness where God is working through

519
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.200
particular people. They're not the seed but God's working

520
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.300
through people. He's working through Moses. He's working through Joshua. We see

521
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.800
Caleb being a faithful man in the Book of Joshua and

522
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.000
judges.

523
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.200
And we get to First Samuel and Hannah is a

524
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.600
faithful woman.

525
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.100
I mean, there's so much going on guys. She's a barren woman.

526
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:53.000
She goes in praising the temple God opens. Her womb gives

527
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.200
her a son he serves in the temple and then he

528
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.600
becomes the man who anoints the king.

529
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.800
Now you just think about that for a second you think about the Gospel of Luke how it

530
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.500
starts Elizabeth is a barren woman who goes

531
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.500
and prays the temple God opens her womb she gives

532
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.300
birth to a son who's dedicated to the Lord and He anoints the

533
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.100
coming King Jesus.

534
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.400
That's the kind of thing that the Bible does but

535
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.500
first Samuel there's the hope.

536
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.000
In the midst of this darkness, that is the end of the Book of

537
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.500
Judges.

538
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.400
Where Israel looks worse than Sodom and

539
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:24.800
Gomorrah.

540
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.600
God brings hope

541
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.500
and he brings hope through this man Samuel Israel. Meanwhile is

542
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.500
still terrible. The priests are offering meat

543
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.400
sacrifice Idols the high priest Sons.

544
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.300
They're bringing women in to have relations with him in

545
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.000
the Tabernacle like it's terrible.

546
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.100
In the midst of all that Israel says we want to

547
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.300
King like the Nations.

548
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.500
To fight our battles for us.

549
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.400
And God says okay. Here's here's Saul.

550
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.200
They want to look like the Nations, right? And again this goes back

551
00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.200
to this comment about

552
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.400
if Israel had obeyed if they had had faith.

553
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.200
God was going before them and the nations would

554
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.900
bow in fear and trembling.

555
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.200
And instead here's Israel fearing and trembling

556
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.000
everyone around them. So we need to strong man.

557
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.500
We need a big tall strong guy.

558
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.800
Who's going to go out and fight our battles for us?

559
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.700
We don't need you God.

560
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.800
We need big strong, man.

561
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.800
So he gives him Saul Saul's terrible.

562
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.000
God says I've had enough of that David Okay, so

563
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.500
What happens at this point is?

564
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.400
The story of David and Solomon is going to mirror everything. We've said

565
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.700
both of them look like

566
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:40.700
the seed

567
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.100
the seed has gone from Eve to

568
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.500
Noah and then to

569
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.900
shim and then eventually

570
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.300
to Abraham Isaac Jacob

571
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.200
Judah.

572
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.500
And then we've been going through the conquest and finally we get to King David

573
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.100
and it's through the line of David that the seed is going

574
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.200
to come. So we keep we keep kind of narrowing down.

575
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.500
Where the seed is coming from?

576
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.200
And this is this is pretty much the narrowest point. It's going

577
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.700
to be not just a human being.

578
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:13.900
seed of woman

579
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.000
it's not even just gonna be an Israelite see Dev Abraham.

580
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.300
It's not even just gonna be a judai.

581
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.200
It's gonna be specifically from the line of David from the

582
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.000
line of Kings.

583
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.400
and in a number of ways

584
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.100
Both David and Solomon look like

585
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.000
they're them. They're the seed.

586
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.100
because if you read the stories of David and Solomon at the beginning

587
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:40.800
What do they do?

588
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.200
They conquer people around them that were left unconquered.

589
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.800
They expand the borders of the land.

590
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.300
David asks God to build a temple

591
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.100
and then Solomon builds the temple this permanent dwelling place

592
00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.300
that people will have with God.

593
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.200
It says they're fruitful multiply David actually says that

594
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.000
Israel is bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.

595
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.300
in second Samuel 5

596
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.300
like this is a direct comment.

597
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.600
On we're getting back to the Garden y'all.

598
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.700
We're fine. It's finally happening.

599
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.800
I remember the it's happening. That's what's

600
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.200
going on here.

601
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.600
David and Solomon both in many ways look like they're the

602
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:28.600
one

603
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.100
and if you if you think about those four tasks and the

604
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.600
four promises to Abraham.

605
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.000
each both David and Solomon map on to those

606
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.200
they're kings. They're ruling.

607
00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.200
They're being fruitful and multiplying and expanding the

608
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.100
borders of the land.

609
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.300
The land is Flowing with milk and honey. They're caring

610
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:50.500
for it.

611
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:54.900
What's that fourth one?

612
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:57.700
Do they obey?

613
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.300
Even even with Solomon right you add at will come

614
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.500
back to that one. Even with Solomon Solomon asked for wisdom.

615
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.700
Like Joseph remember that?

616
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.300
Solomon builds this Temple this place for God to dwell with his

617
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:13.400
people.

618
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.000
They look like

619
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.100
new atoms

620
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.500
And yet both of them failed The crucial point that everybody else

621
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.600
has failed at so far.

622
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.000
Which is they can't obey?

623
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.300
David takes another man's wife.

624
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.400
As his own Bathsheba and then has that man

625
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.900
killed on the front lines of battle.

626
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.800
And so again, I mean you hear that, right?

627
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.300
David takes he touches something that

628
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.500
is forbidden.

629
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.600
Just like Eve did just like Aiken did.

630
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:55.600
He fails.

631
00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:58.800
Solomon

632
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.800
same thing.

633
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.600
We read all in this I can't like.

634
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.800
I would I would have Bible study with you y'all until

635
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.100
The cows come home like we I could just

636
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.500
talk about this stuff all the time. But if you read this the descriptions of

637
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.300
the temple, which everybody skips over because it

638
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.400
is super boring.

639
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.500
If you can't hear the resonances.

640
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.800
but here's a tip all those things that

641
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.400
first first Kings describes when Solomon

642
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.300
is building the Temple

643
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.300
basins of water and animals holding it

644
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.600
and vines on the walls and gold and Lilies

645
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.900
all of that is a reference to

646
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.100
say something wrong.

647
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.600
All that's a reference to the garden.

648
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.900
The temple looks like a garden.

649
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.100
So this Temple is being described in such a way that

650
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.400
it's obviously the place that's supposed to be where God

651
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.800
draws those people just like God calling Israel up on the Mount Sinai just

652
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.500
like him giving them the Tabernacle laws. Here's this

653
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.000
Temple. That's that looks like the garden.

654
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.100
And God says I'm going to dwell with my people in

655
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.600
my place.

656
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.200
And yet David and Solomon both

657
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.100
failed just like Adam failed and Noah failed and

658
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.500
Abraham failed and Isaac failed and Jacob failed and Judah failed.

659
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.400
and Moses failed and Israel failed

660
00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.300
David and Solomon both failed

661
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.700
And if Solomon is is the high point of Israel's history,

662
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.200
it's also the beginning of its failure. It's

663
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:38.600
it's really

664
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.300
I would say it's final destruction.

665
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.100
Like you get to Solomon, it's this it's this High Point.

666
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.200
And then after Solomon it goes downhill so fast just like

667
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.800
Adam and Eve right after they sin Cain

668
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.200
and Abel lamech.

669
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.800
demon sex and Genesis 6 Tower of

670
00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.700
Babel like it all goes

671
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.000
crazy really fast Solomon dies

672
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.700
Israel splits into two North

673
00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.200
and South

674
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.200
Judah is the southern Kingdom Israel is the

675
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.600
northern kingdom. Sometimes that's described as Judah

676
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.400
and Benjamin are the two names that are used because

677
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.100
Benjamin migrates North eventually.

678
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.900
Remember Judah and Benjamin remember how

679
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.400
Judah was supposed to destroy Benjamin.

680
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.100
remember that

681
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.300
Southern Northern

682
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.100
the kings of those two now distinct Nations

683
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.300
Are almost all terrible?

684
00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.700
The if you read through the second half

685
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.700
of First Kings and all of Second Kings, what you're

686
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.700
going to hear is just like story after story after

687
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.400
Story. Excuse me, where it just gets worse and worse

688
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.400
and you can't even tell the difference between these guys anymore.

689
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.900
Like wait, which horrible King was that?

690
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.300
It sounds like that horrible King. They're all terrible.

691
00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.300
And eventually you get to the Exile that happens

692
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.400
throughout Second Kings. First of all, the Northern

693
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.100
Kingdom of Israel is destroyed by the Assyrians in

694
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.000
721 BC. And then the southern

695
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.700
Kingdom of Judah is destroyed by the Babylonians in

696
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.600
586 BC and Israel

697
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.700
is cast out of the land.

698
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.300
And this is what God told Israel. He would do in

699
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.500
Deuteronomy. He says if you fail to keep my law the land

700
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.600
will vomit you out.

701
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.500
Remember they were supposed to care for the land.

702
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.500
Well, they have destroyed the land and the land has vomited

703
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:36.900
them out.

704
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.600
Just like God kicked Adam and

705
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.200
Eve out of the garden.

706
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.000
Israel's story is Adam's story?

707
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.700
Adam and Eve were given instructions to be fruitful and

708
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.100
multiply care for God's place rule over God's place

709
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.100
and Obey God's word.

710
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.700
And they failed and God kicked them out.

711
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.200
Israel was told to be fruitful multiply care for God's

712
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.100
place rule over God's place and obey his word

713
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.300
and they didn't obey and got kicked him out.

714
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.600
Adam's story is Israel's story and Adams and

715
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.800
Israel. Story is our story.

716
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.600
Adam couldn't obey.

717
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.500
Noah couldn't obey Abraham Isaac Jacob Judah

718
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:20.800
Moses

719
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.200
David Solomon me and you

720
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.100
none of us can't obey.

721
00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.600
None of us are able on our own.

722
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.300
To bring ourselves into relationship with God

723
00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.500
or maintain a relationship with God.

724
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.100
This is why Paul says in Galatians that the law was given

725
00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:46.800
as a teacher.

726
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:48.800
a Schoolmaster

727
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:50.800
the law

728
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.300
wasn't intended to describe Utopia.

729
00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.300
A perfect place. I mean in a perfect place nobody's murdering each

730
00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.100
other and you don't have to deal with that in a court of law.

731
00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.800
nobody's holding slaves in a Utopia

732
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.400
God gave God gave Israel the law to teach

733
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.500
them that they could not stay away

734
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.600
from sin and Death on their own.

735
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.100
But Paul also says in Galatians that he gave the law.

736
00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.200
as a guardrail, basically

737
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.100
To guard what what are we

738
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.600
waiting on? Who are we waiting on the whole time?

739
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.300
The seed if Israel is obliterated. What

740
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.200
else is obliterated?

741
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.100
the line of the seed

742
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.600
so God gives them the law to teach

743
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.700
them about their need for him.

744
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.500
And also to make sure that they don't get so bad.

745
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.000
That he obliterates them and the line of

746
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.100
the seed is destroyed.

747
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.500
So we get to the end of Second Kings.

748
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.700
Everybody has been kicked out of the land.

749
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.000
There are some stories that there's still hope in

750
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.700
Esther and Ezra Nehemiah.

751
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:05.900
We don't have time.

752
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.700
It's my fault. I know it's my fault. I

753
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.700
have only myself to blame but like Ezra

754
00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.000
man, he's crossing a river. He's crossing the

755
00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.200
Jordan River. He brings the temple vessels. It's a new

756
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.100
Exodus anyway.

757
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.800
The final section of the Old Testament is the

758
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.400
wisdom literature and then the prophets.

759
00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:32.400
In different ways both the wisdom literature Psalms Proverbs

760
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.200
Ecclesiastes Etc. And the prophets Isaiah Jeremiah

761
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.900
Ezekiel, Daniel.

762
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.000
Etc all of those are pointing forward

763
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.100
to the hope that Israel still has

764
00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.000
okay. So what I want what I want

765
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.400
you to do is think about again where we

766
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.800
started with Psalm 78.

767
00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.100
Think about where was Psalm 78?

768
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.100
and that's the story we've just been telling

769
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.700
Right Israel, can't obey.

770
00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.500
Israel needs

771
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.700
what do they need? What do they need to obey?

772
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.800
What this is what Moses

773
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.600
says in numbers?

774
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.800
Which I you know, I get it nobody reads numbers. But if you read numbers, we we see

775
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.800
in numbers is numbers 14 when Joshua

776
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.100
and Caleb come back and give a good report. It says that

777
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.500
because it was because Caleb had a different spirit

778
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.300
in him.

779
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.200
What what do they need? And what does Adam need? What is

780
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.600
Abraham need? What is

781
00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.100
Isaac and Jacob Etc what they need to

782
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:46.500
obey

783
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:48.900
a different spirit

784
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.500
What do we need to obey?

785
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.300
a different spirit

786
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.900
so Psalm 78 what I read at. The beginning was

787
00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.700
the story that we've just walked through.

788
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.300
At the end of the story of Israel, they are waiting.

789
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:05.900
for something

790
00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.000
they're waiting for the seed.

791
00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:16.200
But they're also waiting for the seed to come in

792
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.500
a way that they recognize in a

793
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.400
way that they expect in a way that restores what

794
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.300
now now not just what Adam lost but what Israel lost

795
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.600
think about what Israel's lost.

796
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.400
Think about what Adams lost Adam lost his ability

797
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.100
to rule over God's Place. Israel has lost their King.

798
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.300
from the line of David

799
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.600
Adam lost

800
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.100
the garden that he was to cultivate and keep

801
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.800
Israel has been kicked out of the land flowing with milk and honey.

802
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:49.400
Adam

803
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.400
lost

804
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.600
and really sin affected Adam's ability to be fruitful

805
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.900
and multiply Israel is now scattered not

806
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.400
a nation.

807
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.800
Not making more image bears not expanding

808
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.300
the borders.

809
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.300
Adam couldn't obey Israel can obey

810
00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.400
and just like Adam was waiting on the seed.

811
00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.800
Israel's waiting on the seed

812
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.600
so in the wisdom literature and the prophets

813
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.700
what we find is that Israel's story isn't over.

814
00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.000
Just like we talked about in Genesis and this is why I spent so much

815
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.200
time on Genesis and the first half of Exodus.

816
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.600
Because if you can get the sense of Israel's story from the

817
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.900
beginning.

818
00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.500
You can understand how it ends.

819
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.200
And this is why I can go a lot faster this week because if you

820
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.400
have that basic understanding of how it started.

821
00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.500
You can understand where it's going and how it is.

822
00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.700
Okay, so Israel's waiting now in the wisdom literature

823
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.300
and the prophets.

824
00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:57.700
Were they waiting on?

825
00:43:59.500 --> 00:43:59.700
well

826
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.500
Let's talk through it. Let's talk through the things we've just

827
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:03.800
mentioned.

828
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.200
Israel is

829
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.200
Trying to decide where to start. He just want to start with is

830
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.100
visuals waiting for the seed seed of woman. Okay, so that's a

831
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.300
very clear expectation in the profits and in the wisdom literature. See

832
00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.000
the one where is he?

833
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.400
He's going to be the one to restore.

834
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.200
Israel and Adam were kicked out of the land.

835
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.200
They're waiting for the land to be restored for them to be there the

836
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.200
way that the New Testament puts it

837
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.500
is they're waiting to be restored from exile.

838
00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.200
They've been kicked out. They've been exiled they're waiting to come back in.

839
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.500
To the land where they're going to care for it. They're going to cultivate it.

840
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.500
and you think about that think about

841
00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.300
how about for just a second what God did when he

842
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.000
kicked Adam and Eve out of the garden.

843
00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.200
He put these two angels on the side and he also clothed them with skins,

844
00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.300
right?

845
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.600
And then we saw an exodus. How is he going to release his people from bondage?

846
00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.300
through sacrifice

847
00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.000
right, so a kind of

848
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.700
Natural way to connect the dots here is that they're waiting

849
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.600
to be brought back into the land, but they know they need forgiveness of

850
00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.100
sin.

851
00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:23.700
to do that

852
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:25.900
and especially through

853
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:27.300
blood

854
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.300
also related to God's place. They're waiting

855
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.100
for the temple to be restored.

856
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.500
There's a lot of prophecies about the temple being rebuilt.

857
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.400
In the profits, there's a lot of talk about the temple in the

858
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.400
wisdom literature. They're waiting for God's place to be restored because

859
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.100
the temple as a building

860
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:54.200
the building itself is a

861
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.700
sign of what really matters which

862
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:56.800
is

863
00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.600
the presence of God

864
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.400
they're waiting on God's presence to be in their midst again.

865
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.700
They're waiting on.

866
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.800
God to restore them ruling over God's Place specifically with

867
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.300
a king from the line of David.

868
00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.500
So just so I remember what I've already said seed.

869
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:22.800
land sacrifice Temple King

870
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.300
remember in Exodus that one of

871
00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.100
the ways that he brings his people out of bondage and into the

872
00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:34.300
land is through victory over his enemy. So there's a lot of promises about God

873
00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.000
having victory.

874
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.500
over his enemies

875
00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.700
And ultimately that Victory is a victory over the final enemy

876
00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.400
and this is true in the Old Testament as well as the New Testament

877
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.900
the final enemy is death.

878
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.600
So there is an expectation of Resurrection not just death and suffering

879
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.300
but Resurrection.

880
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.200
there is

881
00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:01.300
an expectation that Israel will no longer be two Nations,

882
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.700
but one Israel and Judah will be reunited.

883
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.600
and there's an expectation that

884
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:13.500
the Holy Spirit

885
00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.700
will dwell in the hearts of God's people.

886
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.200
Because they know we can't obey you on our

887
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:21.500
own God.

888
00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.000
We need your Holy Spirit. This is the promise of the New Covenant.

889
00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.300
Jeremiah 31 Ezekiel 36

890
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.700
the New Covenant promise is that God's spirit will dwell

891
00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.100
with his people not just in their midst.

892
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.000
in the Tabernacle and Temple but in their hearts

893
00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.700
and it expressly says so that you can obey.

894
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.400
all of this

895
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.600
all of this and this this is kind of like the summary expectation

896
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.600
the tenth one here. All of

897
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.800
this is going to happen when God sins

898
00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.900
his Messiah.

899
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.300
His Messiah is the seed his Messiah is the

900
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.400
king from the line of David his Messiah is

901
00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.100
the one who's going to suffer and Rise Again.

902
00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.400
rebuild the Temple

903
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.500
bring the people back in the land reunite them as one people.

904
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.200
The Messiah is the one who's going to do that the anointed one.

905
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:21.900
Okay, so

906
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.700
this is where the Old Testament ends.

907
00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.600
the Old Testament ends in expectation

908
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.400
The Old Testament is not a finished book. So

909
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.800
to speak we got to get to part two.

910
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.100
the Old Testament authors all realize that

911
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.100
I mean every single book you name me an Old

912
00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.000
Testament book. I'll tell you how it's waiting on something.

913
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:52.800
waiting

914
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.800
on those 10 things basically

915
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.700
We're waiting at the end of the Old Testament for the arrival

916
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.500
of this Messiah.

917
00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.000
Okay, so I want you to

918
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.300
I want you to just take a deep breath.

919
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200
Because I need to take a deep breath.

920
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.200
We just went from Exodus 15 to Malachi 4.

921
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.200
So let's all take a deep breath.

922
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:18.200
and

923
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.700
what you need to

924
00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.400
sort of let sink in.

925
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.100
is

926
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.200
How those things are connected, right? So when we

927
00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:33.100
talk about the New Testament and we talk about Jesus we often talk about

928
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:36.200
how Jesus fulfills over 400 prophecies found the Old

929
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.600
Testament, right? That's true.

930
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:41.400
but

931
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.800
he's fulfilling those.

932
00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.500
As a fulfillment not just of as a kind of like math calculation.

933
00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.200
Like oh it says I'll be born in Bethlehem. So I'm born in Bethlehem.

934
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.200
But those promises those prophecies in the

935
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.400
Old Testament are actually related to that whole story that

936
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.000
we've just told.

937
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.200
Jesus is fulfilling the Prophecies of

938
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.400
the Old Testament because

939
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:10.100
he is.

940
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.400
Fulfilling the promises that God made to Abraham to restore

941
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.800
what Adam lost.

942
00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.200
Jesus is fulfilling those Prophecies of the

943
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.100
Old Testament because

944
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.400
He's bringing a new Exodus where he's going to bring his people out

945
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.100
of bondage.

946
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.500
Not just to Egypt who cares about Egypt.

947
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.100
but to sin

948
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.600
our our first and last enemy.

949
00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.800
Jesus is fulfilling these promises.

950
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.400
Because he's finally going to bring his people into God's place.

951
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.600
Where they'll dwell with him forever.

952
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.500
That's what Jesus is doing and not you know, this is why in

953
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.200
the first week we started with how far are

954
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.100
the effects of sin?

955
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.400
Well the effects of sin stretch to our relationship with God

956
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.300
and also to our relationship with each other and also to the

957
00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.900
relationship with the creation itself.

958
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:09.200
And so what does God promise you he's going to do he promises Abraham. He's going

959
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.700
to reverse the curse. He's going to restore everything that Abraham wants

960
00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:13.500
or that Adam lost.

961
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.300
How is he going to do it through a new Exodus. Who is that going

962
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.000
to be the Messiah who's gonna bring

963
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.600
those other nine things and what the New Testament does is identifies

964
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.600
that person as Jesus.

965
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.600
Okay, so I want us to keep walking.

966
00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.500
For the time remaining through the New Testament and all

967
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.300
I'm really going to do is use those

968
00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.600
categories and give you little Clues as to how to see in

969
00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.500
the New Testament these things.

970
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.300
But in the New Testament what we find

971
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.000
is that it is Jesus who comes as the seed of woman.

972
00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:47.300
and so

973
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.300
think about the genealogy in the Gospel of Luke.

974
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.300
We read the one in Matthew a lot. But do you know where the

975
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.900
one in Luke stretches all the way back to?

976
00:51:59.100 --> 00:51:59.500
Adam

977
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.100
that's a very direct reference to we're waiting on.

978
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:05.900
the seed of woman

979
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.100
Jesus the seat of woman Jesus is the son of David. I mean

980
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.800
if you just read the gospels over and over again, the gospel

981
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.200
is clearly identified Jesus as the son of David. That's

982
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.300
the kind of easy one, right? These are kind of easy.

983
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.100
They'll get harder as we go off.

984
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.000
They identified Jesus as the seed of woman as the son of David.

985
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.700
They identified Jesus as the suffering servant in the book of Isaiah. Especially

986
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.400
we have this promise of the suffering servant who is

987
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.800
going to suffer and die on behalf of Israel

988
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.500
and the Nations really it's

989
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.100
through Israel to the nations are saved.

990
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:47.300
It's the suffering servant. He's

991
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.100
going to pay the penalty for their sins.

992
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.100
And it's through that suffering that God is going to

993
00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:53.500
forgive them.

994
00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.500
The New Testament the gospels clearly identified Jesus as

995
00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.400
the suffering servant.

996
00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.000
The New Testament clearly identifies Jesus as the

997
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.900
one who brings the resurrection of the Dead.

998
00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.300
I mean, I don't I don't really think I have to blame her that but Jesus

999
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.400
roasting the dead everybody and that was a fulfillment of the promise to

1000
00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.300
the Israelites that was related to

1001
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:19.300
and specifically given to show God's victory

1002
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:21.500
over enemies and even over

1003
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.900
the power of sin and death.

1004
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.700
Right. Here's the power that from the beginning has been harassing

1005
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.500
Humanity sin and death.

1006
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.400
Resurrection Jesus wins over sin

1007
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:32.700
and death

1008
00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:37.300
and he wins that victory for Israel and through Israel for

1009
00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:37.700
the Nations.

1010
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:41.300
Jesus restores the nation of Israel

1011
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.000
how many disciples does Jesus call?

1012
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:48.400
12

1013
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.400
how many sons of Jacob were there?

1014
00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.000
12 how many tribes of Israel were there?

1015
00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.300
I mean

1016
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.600
There's not a verse that says the 12 disciples are representations

1017
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.100
of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. But I mean like if you want

1018
00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:09.200
to think that's coincidence, I guess you can that's fine, but it's not

1019
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:09.700
coincidence.

1020
00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:14.300
In fact, if you read the calling of the disciples and the

1021
00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:19.700
stories around that it is obvious that Jesus is reorganizing the

1022
00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:21.500
nation of Israel around himself.

1023
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.600
Jesus restores Israel

1024
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.000
Jesus gives the Holy Spirit

1025
00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.200
he obeys and we'll talk about that in a second and then gives

1026
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.000
the holy spirit. So there's people can obey.

1027
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.700
Jesus also, like I just said obeys where

1028
00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:43.600
we can't.

1029
00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.200
Israel goes out into the Wilderness. And what's the first thing they

1030
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:48.400
do?

1031
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.800
They sin they doubt they lack Faith. Jesus

1032
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.600
goes in the wilderness. And what does he do?

1033
00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:57.800
He obeys.

1034
00:54:59.100 --> 00:54:59.400
I mean

1035
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.400
if you think about if you think about the gospel of Matthew

1036
00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.500
in particular just second.

1037
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:09.900
At the beginning of Matthew we have a genealogy genealogies

1038
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:10.200
are important.

1039
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.400
Jesus is from the line of David.

1040
00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.000
and the line of Abraham

1041
00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:21.000
the beginning and end of Israel's story. I

1042
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.300
know there's more people after David but these are the two dominant

1043
00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.600
figures of Israel's history.

1044
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.200
Jesus is from the line of

1045
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.100
David and Abraham

1046
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.200
But he's not just from the line of David and Abraham. He's

1047
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.000
ultimately from God himself because he is God himself in the

1048
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.400
flesh.

1049
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.200
Immediately what happens to Jesus once he's born?

1050
00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.200
What's the next story in Matthew 2?

1051
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:49.500
Do you know?

1052
00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:57.000
Y'all can talk louder than that. Jesus won't zap

1053
00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:59.200
you if you're wrong. The answer is.

1054
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.000
Herod tries to kill all the male children

1055
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.000
when did that happen?

1056
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.200
in Exodus with Moses

1057
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:14.300
Herod tries to kill all the male children. Where does Joseph go

1058
00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:14.900
with his family?

1059
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:16.400
Egypt

1060
00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:21.900
then they come back from Egypt. And what's the

1061
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:23.100
next story Matthew 3?

1062
00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.100
Baptism where is Jesus baptized?

1063
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.200
In the Jordan where did Israel cross from The

1064
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.600
Exodus into the promised land across the Jordan?

1065
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.600
He goes across the Jordan Air into the Jordan now that Jordan he's in

1066
00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:37.900
the wilderness.

1067
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:40.900
just like

1068
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.100
God brought Israel across the Red Sea Into the

1069
00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:45.500
Wilderness

1070
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.000
What does Israel do in the wilderness?

1071
00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:53.100
They sin. What does Jesus do in the

1072
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:53.400
wilderness?

1073
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.100
He succeeds he obeys.

1074
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.000
Israel then after they fail in the

1075
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.600
wilderness in Exodus 16 and 17. They go to Mount Sinai and

1076
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.800
God gives them a law.

1077
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.400
What does Jesus do after he succeeds in the wilderness in Matthew

1078
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:09.800
5?

1079
00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.700
He stands on a mountain and delivers the law The Sermon

1080
00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:15.100
on the Mount.

1081
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.100
Jesus is greater than Moses.

1082
00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:22.200
Wait a minute Deuteronomy 18 during Army 34 worrying on a

1083
00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.400
prophet greater than Moses. Here. He is.

1084
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.200
Matthew 8 and 9

1085
00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.800
wind waves obey him Authority interpretation of

1086
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:32.500
Israel scriptures

1087
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.200
Finally we get to Matthew 17. Jesus goes up on

1088
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.100
the mountain with Peter James and John and what happens the glory of

1089
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:43.500
God shines from Jesus himself, and

1090
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.400
they see it. Whereas Moses goes up

1091
00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.800
on a mountain and the glory of God is on Moses's face.

1092
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.100
Jesus goes up on the mountain and the glory of

1093
00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:55.500
God comes from within him. He's not just a man.

1094
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.100
He's not just a human being

1095
00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.500
he is God in the flesh.

1096
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.400
You go through the rest of the teaching material. Jesus gets to Jerusalem.

1097
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.700
Goes in the temple. He pronounces judgment over

1098
00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:11.700
it destruction of it.

1099
00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:16.100
Why I mean, he says this in Matthew says it in Mark. He says

1100
00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:19.400
it most clearly in John in John 2. Why does

1101
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.400
Jesus pronounce judgment on the temple? And it's destruction and then

1102
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.200
say in John 2 in three days. I'll rise it

1103
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:25.300
up.

1104
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:28.500
Because the dwelling of God with human beings is

1105
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:31.600
no longer in a building. It's in a person and it's

1106
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.400
the person of Jesus Christ.

1107
00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:37.100
So there's the temple one by the way if you're keeping track of

1108
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:37.500
the 10 things.

1109
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.200
Jesus says he himself is the temple.

1110
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:45.900
You get to the end of Matthew?

1111
00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.400
What happens at the crucifixion?

1112
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.600
And about the ninth hour what?

1113
00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.800
Darkness fell over the land Darkness

1114
00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.300
death of the firstborn son

1115
00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.200
Temple curtains torn into

1116
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.500
and then Jesus rises from the dead and once

1117
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.900
again stands on a mountain.

1118
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.200
at the edge

1119
00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:16.400
of his people's Mission and says all authority on

1120
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.200
in heaven and on Earth has been given to me go there

1121
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.300
for an all nations.

1122
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.600
just like Moses stood at the edge of the land and said

1123
00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:31.000
go into the land. Jesus is greater than

1124
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.500
Moses. Right? This is the way this is the way that the New Testament

1125
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:36.600
tells you who Jesus is.

1126
00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:41.700
He's he's greater than everybody

1127
00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:44.400
else in Israel's history because he is

1128
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.500
the god of Israel in the flesh.

1129
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.800
Through the Incarnation of God the son.

1130
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.600
That's how the New Testament tells you who Jesus is. He's

1131
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.400
what Israel has been waiting for because he is God himself

1132
00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.700
come down to Israel.

1133
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.300
Israel couldn't do it. We can't do it. We need God

1134
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.300
to do it for us. And God. Does that through his son

1135
01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:09.300
Jesus? I mean that's like the whole

1136
01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.300
Bible is the promise and fulfillment of

1137
01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.300
the gospel and the gospel. Is this you and I were

1138
01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.100
made to dwell with God.

1139
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.900
And we mess it up every time.

1140
01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.500
We can't make our way back to God our sins separates

1141
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.200
us from God and so because God is

1142
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.400
gracious and kind he comes down to us and the person of his son.

1143
01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.700
In Jesus of Nazareth and obeys on our behalf. He lives

1144
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.800
the life that we can't.

1145
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.100
He lives the life that Adam couldn't he lives the life that

1146
01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.300
Abraham couldn't that all of Israel couldn't live and that

1147
01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.000
we can't live.

1148
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.200
He lives the life that we can't on our behalf. And then

1149
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.000
he dies the death that we deserve.

1150
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.500
On our behalf. He is the suffering servant who takes the place of

1151
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:53.900
his people.

1152
01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.800
He goes down into enemy territory.

1153
01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.400
the place of the dead and declares his victory

1154
01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.600
over death and then he rises from the dead and victory and

1155
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:06.800
says

1156
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.200
All authority what all authority is mine? Why

1157
01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.600
because I have defeated literally every enemy in

1158
01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.800
my obedient life my vicarious

1159
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.500
death and now by Victorious resurrection, and

1160
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.500
so now I Rise into heaven I Ascend into heaven to

1161
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.100
rule at the right hand of God the Father.

1162
01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.900
He's ruling over not just over a piece of land.

1163
01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.800
He is ruling over all things.

1164
01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:36.600
This is the Fulfillment of the promises of Abraham two

1165
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.600
Abraham. This is the Fulfillment of the hope that we have that the

1166
01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.000
seed is going to come in Reverse The Curse.

1167
01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.100
Adam Israel

1168
01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.300
We're supposed to be fruitful multiply. What

1169
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.100
does Jesus doing right now? He's sending his people out into the

1170
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.800
Nations to share the gospel.

1171
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.300
In the book of Acts. I know I'm running a time in the book of Acts.

1172
01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.500
Every time the gospel goes to a new place acts 6.

1173
01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.700
acts 12 and Acts 19

1174
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.400
every time the gospel goes to a new place. So first of all to the

1175
01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.300
Samaritans or

1176
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:14.400
the judeans and the Samaritans and then

1177
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.100
to the Gentiles every time the gospel goes to a new place.

1178
01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.200
the book of act says and the word of God

1179
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.000
was fruitful and multiplied

1180
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.500
Jesus is being fruitful and multiplying.

1181
01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.900
Through the proclamation of the Gospel by his people.

1182
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.900
and by the power of His spirit

1183
01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.700
Jesus is being fruitful and multiplying right now.

1184
01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.200
By the power of spirit and through the proclamation of the Gospel by his people

1185
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:48.600
to the world.

1186
01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.200
Jesus is ruling over not just

1187
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:53.800
the garden

1188
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.600
not just the promised land. Jesus is ruling

1189
01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:57.700
over.

1190
01:02:59.200 --> 01:02:59.600
everything

1191
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.200
right now

1192
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.800
Jesus has cared for God's place.

1193
01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.500
in John in John chapter 20

1194
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.500
John 19 and 20 Jesus rises from the dead and he rises

1195
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.200
in a garden.

1196
01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.100
With a woman Mary and the woman says what does

1197
01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.500
Mary say? She thought he was the gardener, right? This is

1198
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.000
an obvious Garden scene.

1199
01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.200
Jesus and his resurrection from the dead is restoring creation

1200
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.500
itself.

1201
01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.300
That's what's happening. Jesus cares for

1202
01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:38.700
God's world.

1203
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.100
And obviously he obeys where

1204
01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.400
we can't and now gives us a spirit so that we can obey.

1205
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.000
Why are we still here then?

1206
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.500
If Jesus has fulfilled all the promises.

1207
01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.200
To Abraham if he's restored what Adam lost? Why are

1208
01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:57.500
we still here?

1209
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.400
Why y'all think?

1210
01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:04.800
What are we doing?

1211
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.300
What are we what was the book of act say being fruitful and multiplying

1212
01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.600
because God promises in the Old Testament. He's going to bring the Gentiles

1213
01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:11.700
in.

1214
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.400
God is God is being fruitful and multiplying

1215
01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.200
filling the Earth with every tribe tongue and Nation.

1216
01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.000
full of image bearers

1217
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.900
and those restored

1218
01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.100
to their full Humanity by the grace of the Lord

1219
01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:27.300
Jesus

1220
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.300
That's why we're still here. We're still here from Mission.

1221
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.000
That's it.

1222
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.300
Jesus second Corinthians, 1:20 says

1223
01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.800
all the promises of God find their yes in Christ Jesus.

1224
01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.600
That's not the promise that he you know.

1225
01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.100
Made to me and my dorm room when I asked a red

1226
01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:51.400
helicopter to fly over this guy. That is the promise that he makes

1227
01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.200
to his people in the Old Testament all the promises of God

1228
01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.400
find their yes in Christ. Jesus. Jesus is fulfilled

1229
01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.300
what Israel is waiting on what we are still here for

1230
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.400
is to share the good news with those

1231
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:03.900
around us.

1232
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.700
and so finally when Jesus returns

1233
01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:10.700
in Revelation 21 and 22

1234
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:13.900
This is what we find.

1235
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.500
We find Heaven coming down to earth.

1236
01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.100
God once again comes down.

1237
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.900
To us this time forever.

1238
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.000
He comes down in the New Jerusalem, which is described like a temple.

1239
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.500
Because that's where God dwells with this people.

1240
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.400
Jesus is on his throne in the middle of his people

1241
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.000
in Revelation 21 six and

1242
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.100
seven.

1243
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.900
Five six and seven really declaring that he's

1244
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.400
secured this place by his blood.

1245
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.100
And that we live with him forever. This is the this is God's people

1246
01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.400
dwelling in God's Place finally and forever in Revelation 21 and

1247
01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.900
22 when Jesus returns.

1248
01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.500
Jesus is on the throne ruling. Jesus has been fruitful and

1249
01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.600
multiply if you if you read the description of

1250
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.100
the people in Revelation 21 and 22 and throughout the

1251
01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:07.800
Book of Revelation.

1252
01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.400
They're everywhere.

1253
01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.600
The Earth has been filled.

1254
01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.200
This place is a place that has trees everywhere and

1255
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.100
water flowing and the leaves are for the healing of the

1256
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.600
Nations. This is a place that God has restored through his

1257
01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.300
son Jesus and that is a place that can

1258
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:30.500
be cared and cultivated but also cares for

1259
01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:30.700
us.

1260
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.800
And ultimately it's a place where there will be no more sin.

1261
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.200
Because God in Christ is obeyed on our

1262
01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.100
behalf and has given us his spirit so that we can obey and when

1263
01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:46.400
we too are raised with Christ, we will no longer have sinful fleshly

1264
01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.400
bodies, but raised new bodies.

1265
01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.300
made clean by the blood of Jesus

1266
01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.200
Where are we? I mean this is this is where we need to

1267
01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.400
ask. Okay, if you can get a whole sense of the Bible here are

1268
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:00.900
two things that

1269
01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.800
I think will help.

1270
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.100
In your life number one when you get a whole sense of the

1271
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.100
Bible. It's easier to read books of the Bible you tend to avoid?

1272
01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.600
Okay, so what's the what you know if you want to ask what's the application?

1273
01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.400
What's the cash value here? Where how does my story intersect with

1274
01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.200
this story number one, this is gonna I hope help you

1275
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.000
in your Bible reading.

1276
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.500
If you can if you can say, okay.

1277
01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.200
I'm not really sure what to do with Obadiah.

1278
01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.500
But I know that in the context of this whole story

1279
01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.800
all of these Prophets.

1280
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.100
Are talking about the judgment and salvation of

1281
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.900
Israel and Nations and waiting on the Messiah to come. Okay, that

1282
01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:42.300
helps me.

1283
01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.600
Obadiah is always singled out. I feel really bad for Obadiah. It's

1284
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.500
like would you rather be in a desert island with John or obadia?

1285
01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.100
It's like man. Come on.

1286
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.100
Opa dies inspired by the holy spirit, so

1287
01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.200
You know, I think in that sense.

1288
01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:01.200
I hope that this will help you with your Bible reading but

1289
01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.100
the second thing is this.

1290
01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:04.400
in terms of

1291
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.200
the question

1292
01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.700
Why are we still here or why am I here?

1293
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.500
What's my purpose?

1294
01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.300
What what am I doing? What is my life for?

1295
01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:24.600
It doesn't matter who you are. Your life

1296
01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.600
is intended to be.

1297
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.600
A reflection of the god of the universe because

1298
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.700
you are his image bear.

1299
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:33.400
And if you don't know Jesus.

1300
01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.900
then what you need to hear from this, is that the only way

1301
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.100
That you can actually fulfill your purpose in life

1302
01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.700
is to submit your life to Christ come to him for forgiveness and

1303
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.200
repentance and Faith believe that God raises him

1304
01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:48.600
from the dead.

1305
01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.500
And Trust In His Holy Spirit to transform your life.

1306
01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.400
That's I mean, that's the reason we're all here.

1307
01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.600
We're not here for fame or fortune or Glory or money

1308
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.600
or sex or whatever.

1309
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.000
Or even or even like less.

1310
01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.300
Sinful Idols, they're all sinful by the way, but like,

1311
01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.800
you know, we're not here just for our family.

1312
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.400
Or to love our family. We're not here to help just to help people. We're

1313
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:15.000
here to ultimately Worship the Lord Jesus.

1314
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.900
the second person of the triang god

1315
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.800
and tell other people about it.

1316
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.200
That's why we're here and you do that through your jobs and through your family

1317
01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.300
your relationships. But those things are secondary to the primary

1318
01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.400
purpose of your existence. And if you don't know Jesus in

1319
01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:31.700
this room,

1320
01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.300
this whole story is an invitation for you to come to

1321
01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:36.400
him.

1322
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.600
If you want to talk about that come talk to me come talk to Phil anybody.

1323
01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.100
But if you're a Christian in this room, which I assume many of you most of you

1324
01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:47.200
are maybe all of you maybe 100% if you're a Christian this

1325
01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.700
room, it's really easy to like go through the day-to-day

1326
01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:53.700
the grind even, you know, if you're not at work

1327
01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.900
anymore you're retired or whatever maybe difficult to think.

1328
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.500
And what am I I can't watch another episode of

1329
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.600
Everybody Loves Raymond. Like what? Why am I here?

1330
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.000
It's the same thing is true.

1331
01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:08.100
You are here.

1332
01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.000
to Worship the Lord Jesus

1333
01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.000
second person to try and God In the Flesh

1334
01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:17.200
you are here to live by his Spirit walk by his

1335
01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.900
spirit and to be a testimony to who he is.

1336
01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.100
You are here to be on Mission.

1337
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.100
You are here to share the gospel.

1338
01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.500
And that doesn't you know, that is more that's broader

1339
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.300
than I want you to go knock on doors on Saturday. I

1340
01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:36.700
would do want you to knock on doors on Saturday, but it includes living

1341
01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.000
your daily life in a way that glorifies God.

1342
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.800
as a testimony to him

1343
01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.100
That's why we're here.

1344
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.100
We're still here because God is still saving people.

1345
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.300
And he wants us.

1346
01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:52.500
To be the ones who to proclaim the gospel to the

1347
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:55.000
people around us to the Nations around us who don't know him.

1348
01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:59.400
So when you I mean maybe some of you don't feel this but there

1349
01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.400
are lots of people these days who feel a lack of purpose a

1350
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.700
lack of energy a lack of drive if that's you

1351
01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.400
you're not going to find it in, you know.

1352
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.500
Joining CrossFit or you know

1353
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.300
getting a promotion or having grandkids.

1354
01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.400
or whatever all those things fade

1355
01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.500
What doesn't fade is the god of the universe who

1356
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.400
made you in His image?

1357
01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.200
Who saved you by the blood of his son and who wants

1358
01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.400
you to testify to him by the power of His spirit?

1359
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.700
Let's pray God. Thank you for your word.

1360
01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.300
Thank you that you have inspired it by the

1361
01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.700
power of your holy spirit. Thank you that this one story is

1362
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.300
ultimately the story of your son.

1363
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.700
That while we were yet sinners while all

1364
01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:46.900
of us.

1365
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.300
from Adam to today

1366
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.300
couldn't obey you sent your son to live the life that

1367
01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:53.800
we can't.

1368
01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.200
To Die the death that we deserve for

1369
01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.700
our sin to rise Victorious over sin and

1370
01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:00.800
death.

1371
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:05.100
to ascend into heaven and Rule and Reign Over All

1372
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:05.400
Things

1373
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.500
to build your church and your kingdom through the proclamation of

1374
01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.100
the Gospel as the word is fruitful and multiplies through

1375
01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.000
evangelism and ultimately to come back in glory.

1376
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.800
right raising the living in the Dead

1377
01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:22.100
judging them

1378
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.000
and dwelling together forever with your people.

1379
01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.200
Help us to understand our story in light of your story help us

1380
01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.900
to understand our purpose in light of your purpose for creation.

1381
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:34.600
and Redemption

1382
01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.100
help us to just love our Bibles God.

1383
01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:39.600
not because

1384
01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.300
not because our bibles are where we find life. But because our

1385
01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:46.800
bibles are the way that you communicate to us. And

1386
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.100
you're the one in whom we have life.

1387
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.200
We pray that you make us more like your son Jesus and you

1388
01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.800
do it by the power of your Holy Spirit. We ask in Christ name.

1389
01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:56.900
amen

1390
01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.600
Let's give him a big hand.

1391
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.000
amen

1392
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.400
Wanted to remind you the next week. We start our four

1393
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.200
week series on our role in a culture War

1394
01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.400
next week. We will be addressing the lgbtq. Agenda.

1395
01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.400
We have Stephen black from first own Ministries

1396
01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.000
going to come as our guest and he is in

1397
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.000
his ministry in first stone responds to

1398
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.700
and helps people who are still caught in

1399
01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:27.300
sexual Brokenness. And so it's going to be really

1400
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.300
really helpful. I don't know if you knew this but the world seems to

1401
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.700
be kind of stuck on that issue and we as Christian

1402
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.700
people because we are called to be fruitful and multiply

1403
01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:40.600
and we are here to be countercultural and

1404
01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.200
change the culture as the holy spirit

1405
01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.200
gives us understanding how to do so that we need to address these

1406
01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:49.300
issues. So we will look at that issue the following

1407
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.400
issue. We'll have a panel discussing race relations and

1408
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.200
Reconciliation after that. We'll be looking at American freedom.

1409
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.500
I want to tell you this I told

1410
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.400
this group right here. I was studying because I was going

1411
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.400
to be the one to

1412
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.100
About religious liberty and I was set in this book.

1413
01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.300
It was a really good book and I thought man. I wish

1414
01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:12.600
that this guy the guy that wrote this book could come so

1415
01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.100
I emailed him and he's gonna be

1416
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.800
here so he'll be here on Zoom, but Dr.

1417
01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.600

1421
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.600
know how we can do any better than we did with Dr.

1422
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.000
Emerson, but thank you for coming. I think we'll have him back

1423
01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.600

1424
