WEBVTT

1
00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.965
David, we good? Alright,

2
00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:19.835
Welcome everybody.

3
00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:23.405
We're gonna open with a worship psalm,

4
00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:27.325
so we'll sing together that'll, uh, warm our hearts to

5
00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:30.445
what God has for us from his word tonight.

6
00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:31.965
So let's go ahead and sing.

7
00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:32.725
This is a song,

8
00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:37.605
um, that we'll enjoy together.

9
00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:40.645
You wanna stand? Yeah, let's go ahead and stand everybody.

10
00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:41.645
And

11
00:05:43.835 --> 00:05:44.835
Beautiful. You

12
00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:46.085
all can have a seat.

13
00:05:53.955 --> 00:05:58.005
Does everybody have a sheet with class notes on

14
00:05:58.005 --> 00:05:59.005
It?

15
00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:07.085
Alright, well welcome tonight.

16
00:06:07.225 --> 00:06:08.805
Uh, my name is Ryan Whitaker.

17
00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:12.605
If you don't know me already, um, I've served here

18
00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:14.445
as an elder for the last four years

19
00:06:14.945 --> 00:06:19.285
and my family, uh, has been coming to Henderson Hills for

20
00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:21.365
over 16 years now.

21
00:06:21.705 --> 00:06:24.205
And, um, we love this church.

22
00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:29.845
We love this church because God is exalted in all

23
00:06:29.985 --> 00:06:32.045
of his attributes here

24
00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:36.685
and that song is just full of how good he is.

25
00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:40.765
I've been such a recipient of God's grace in my life and so,

26
00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:42.325
but it's really good to see you.

27
00:06:42.325 --> 00:06:43.965
Thank you for coming out on a Wednesday night

28
00:06:43.965 --> 00:06:46.845
and we're gonna dig deep into a lot of things tonight.

29
00:06:47.425 --> 00:06:51.605
And so before we get going, let's go ahead and pray with me.

30
00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:53.205
Go ahead and back your, your eyes.

31
00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:58.885
Father, you are holy, holy,

32
00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:01.945
holy God.

33
00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:06.785
Your word says that you dwell in inapproachable light

34
00:07:07.005 --> 00:07:09.505
and yet you make yourself known through Jesus.

35
00:07:12.255 --> 00:07:15.185
Forgive us that we have, uh, often

36
00:07:15.955 --> 00:07:17.625
small thoughts of you

37
00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:22.705
and that we trade your glory for lesser things.

38
00:07:24.135 --> 00:07:26.515
God, we see in your word that you are the giver of every

39
00:07:27.145 --> 00:07:28.595
good gift to us.

40
00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:33.465
We thank you for your spirit tonight.

41
00:07:35.085 --> 00:07:39.585
Our spirit remakes us to reflect your character.

42
00:07:40.615 --> 00:07:42.915
So God, we pray that you would open our eyes tonight

43
00:07:43.055 --> 00:07:45.715
as we lift up these truths, uh,

44
00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.395
from your word you have given to us.

45
00:07:49.175 --> 00:07:51.195
And so we ask that you would shape our worship,

46
00:07:51.415 --> 00:07:53.595
you would shape our holiness

47
00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:57.075
and you would shape our love so

48
00:07:57.075 --> 00:07:58.875
that others would see your beauty.

49
00:08:00.135 --> 00:08:03.355
We ask these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.

50
00:08:03.905 --> 00:08:07.795
Alright, I have a question for you.

51
00:08:07.815 --> 00:08:11.595
So what comes into your mind when you think about God?

52
00:08:13.385 --> 00:08:15.795
What comes into your mind when you think about God?

53
00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:20.315
What I say A song. I'm sorry,

54
00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:21.745
What? I, Isaiah a

55
00:08:21.745 --> 00:08:22.275
saw

56
00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:23.655
And what did he see?

57
00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:30.075
Just filling up the hole. Yeah.

58
00:08:31.485 --> 00:08:32.795
Where it was, yeah.

59
00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:38.275
Recognizing how unclean lives he had. Yeah.

60
00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:40.235
I love that

61
00:08:42.065 --> 00:08:44.115
Greg said, it is so beautifully.

62
00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:49.915
Thank you, Greg. The answer to your question about

63
00:08:49.945 --> 00:08:52.555
what you think about God is the most important

64
00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:54.835
thing about you.

65
00:08:57.315 --> 00:08:58.725
What do you think about that for a second?

66
00:09:00.005 --> 00:09:03.285
A w Tozer has a quote where he says,

67
00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:06.605
what comes into our minds when we think about God is the

68
00:09:06.605 --> 00:09:08.525
most important thing about us.

69
00:09:10.465 --> 00:09:12.365
And I don't think that he's exaggerated.

70
00:09:15.065 --> 00:09:19.845
So if your vision of God is small, then your worship

71
00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:22.725
of God will be small.

72
00:09:25.985 --> 00:09:29.645
But if you see him as he really is, that he is holy

73
00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:30.925
and he is loving

74
00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:32.725
and he is wise,

75
00:09:34.235 --> 00:09:37.885
then your whole life is reordered

76
00:09:39.225 --> 00:09:42.765
in awe and in worship and in obedience.

77
00:09:44.185 --> 00:09:48.725
And that vision that you behold of him in that it transforms

78
00:09:50.015 --> 00:09:54.965
everything two

79
00:09:54.965 --> 00:09:56.525
Corinthians three 18 says,

80
00:09:56.785 --> 00:10:00.365
and we all with unveiled faiths, behold the glory

81
00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:04.565
of God are being transformed into the same image from one

82
00:10:04.585 --> 00:10:07.805
degree of glory to another.

83
00:10:10.905 --> 00:10:13.885
And so what comes into our minds when we think about God is

84
00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:16.525
the most important thing about us.

85
00:10:19.315 --> 00:10:21.765
Tonight we're talking about the communicable attributes

86
00:10:21.765 --> 00:10:24.645
of God, and that is a, uh, theological word,

87
00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.205
but here's what that means.

88
00:10:26.215 --> 00:10:28.765
These are attributes that God shares

89
00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:31.725
in part with us.

90
00:10:34.105 --> 00:10:36.845
And I want to thank Dan. He's not here this week, um,

91
00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:39.075
but last week he took us

92
00:10:39.075 --> 00:10:41.275
through God's incommunicable attributes.

93
00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.065
And can anybody remember any of any of those?

94
00:10:46.675 --> 00:10:48.385
Which ones? Do you remember which stand?

95
00:10:48.385 --> 00:10:52.505
Which stand out to you? Incommunicable attributes.

96
00:10:55.505 --> 00:10:58.785
Holiness. Holiness. What else?

97
00:10:59.285 --> 00:11:01.265
I'm just guessing. Omnipresence,

98
00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:04.105
Omnipresence, ent, omnipotence.

99
00:11:04.975 --> 00:11:05.585
What else?

100
00:11:10.945 --> 00:11:13.065
Immutability. Oh, that's a beautiful one.

101
00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:16.305
In the Old Testament,

102
00:11:16.605 --> 00:11:20.945
before God's commands came, the people dealt

103
00:11:20.945 --> 00:11:24.185
with fickle, unpredictable gods

104
00:11:25.255 --> 00:11:26.385
meaning they change.

105
00:11:26.525 --> 00:11:28.625
And you could, you're, you're always in fear of

106
00:11:29.095 --> 00:11:30.865
what is this God going to do to me?

107
00:11:31.005 --> 00:11:34.465
And God's immutability should be a comfort

108
00:11:34.565 --> 00:11:36.105
to us and should be.

109
00:11:37.805 --> 00:11:42.545
So yeah, all of those are incommunicable attributes.

110
00:11:43.565 --> 00:11:45.905
And so unlike God's incommunicable attributes,

111
00:11:46.095 --> 00:11:48.785
like his infinity or his immutability

112
00:11:48.885 --> 00:11:53.025
or his omnipresence, Communicable attributes are ones

113
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.365
that we can reflect.

114
00:11:54.825 --> 00:11:58.845
So think about that, that God invites his children

115
00:11:59.425 --> 00:12:00.885
to look like him.

116
00:12:02.185 --> 00:12:04.485
That's a pretty special thing. So let me ask you this.

117
00:12:04.705 --> 00:12:08.885
Why does God share his attributes with his people?

118
00:12:10.185 --> 00:12:12.125
Why does he share his attributes with his people?

119
00:12:13.025 --> 00:12:14.925
Here's the big idea, and you see this at the top

120
00:12:14.925 --> 00:12:19.605
of your sheet, says, God shares his attributes

121
00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:23.365
with his people so that we can reflect His

122
00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:25.805
what His glory.

123
00:12:28.305 --> 00:12:29.925
He shares his attributes with us so

124
00:12:30.005 --> 00:12:31.165
that we can reflect his glory.

125
00:12:31.165 --> 00:12:35.045
And that matters for three reasons. Number one, worship.

126
00:12:35.225 --> 00:12:38.645
It matters because when you see who God is, you

127
00:12:39.815 --> 00:12:40.845
adore him.

128
00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:46.035
And we'll talk about this verse a little bit more later.

129
00:12:46.035 --> 00:12:47.275
This is the memory verse that we have

130
00:12:47.275 --> 00:12:49.555
for tonight's Exodus 34 67.

131
00:12:49.775 --> 00:12:53.315
Listen to this. The Lord passed before him Moses

132
00:12:54.015 --> 00:12:57.755
and proclaimed the Lord, the Lord a God, merciful

133
00:12:57.895 --> 00:12:59.515
and gracious, slow to anger

134
00:12:59.935 --> 00:13:02.435
and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.

135
00:13:03.175 --> 00:13:06.195
He can steadfast love for thousands forgiving iniquity

136
00:13:06.575 --> 00:13:08.515
and transgression and sin.

137
00:13:09.015 --> 00:13:11.115
But who will by no means clear the guilty.

138
00:13:11.775 --> 00:13:15.635
Now listen carefully to verse eight. Jump to verse eight.

139
00:13:16.805 --> 00:13:21.715
After Moses hears all of this, Moses quickly

140
00:13:22.485 --> 00:13:26.915
bowed his head toward the earth and he worshiped.

141
00:13:29.105 --> 00:13:33.205
So when you see who God is, you adore him

142
00:13:33.865 --> 00:13:35.765
and you worship him.

143
00:13:38.145 --> 00:13:40.045
So it matters because of worship matters,

144
00:13:40.045 --> 00:13:42.725
because when you imitate his attributes,

145
00:13:42.745 --> 00:13:46.765
you grow in holiness, which is our sanctification.

146
00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:49.885
So it matters because of our sanctification.

147
00:13:49.885 --> 00:13:53.405
Leviticus 19 two says, you shall be holy for the Lord.

148
00:13:53.675 --> 00:13:55.605
Your God is holy.

149
00:13:56.785 --> 00:14:01.125
One Peter one 16, you shall be holy. For I am holy.

150
00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:04.925
Ephesians five, one, therefore be what?

151
00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:07.925
Imitators of God as beloved children.

152
00:14:10.155 --> 00:14:12.335
So it matters for our sanctification.

153
00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.495
It matters for now our witness.

154
00:14:15.195 --> 00:14:19.375
It matters because when others see his attributes in you,

155
00:14:20.085 --> 00:14:22.815
they glimpse him.

156
00:14:24.685 --> 00:14:27.655
They glimpse him. Matthew five 16 says this,

157
00:14:27.675 --> 00:14:29.815
in the same way, let your light shine

158
00:14:29.815 --> 00:14:33.295
before others so that they may see or get your good works

159
00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:36.175
and give glory to your father who's in heaven.

160
00:14:37.205 --> 00:14:39.655
Then John 13 34, 3 5 says,

161
00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:42.295
new commandment I give you

162
00:14:42.295 --> 00:14:44.375
that you love one another just as I've loved you.

163
00:14:44.915 --> 00:14:46.375
You are also are to love one another.

164
00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:49.575
By this, all people will know that you are my disciples.

165
00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:52.485
If you have love for one another.

166
00:14:54.705 --> 00:14:58.885
God is glorified as we worship,

167
00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:03.685
as we're sanctified, as we witness.

168
00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:07.805
So here's how we'll walk through this tonight.

169
00:15:07.855 --> 00:15:10.325
First, a quick explanation of

170
00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:11.725
what communicable attributes are,

171
00:15:11.825 --> 00:15:15.685
and then second, we'll talk about the attributes themselves.

172
00:15:15.695 --> 00:15:17.125
We'll group them into categories.

173
00:15:17.205 --> 00:15:19.045
A lot of books

174
00:15:19.065 --> 00:15:21.285
and theologians will group them in different ways

175
00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:22.765
and label them in different ways.

176
00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:23.965
And that doesn't matter a whole lot.

177
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:26.485
But for the purpose of tonight, uh,

178
00:15:26.695 --> 00:15:29.805
we're I think using primarily the book Bible doctrine,

179
00:15:29.865 --> 00:15:33.645
we will follow that list as the book has for simplicity.

180
00:15:33.645 --> 00:15:35.125
And then we'll ask what so

181
00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:37.085
what, like what do we do with this?

182
00:15:37.105 --> 00:15:39.085
So now that we have a vision of who God is

183
00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:42.565
and his attributes, how does that affect our Monday mornings

184
00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:44.965
as we get ready for the week?

185
00:15:45.025 --> 00:15:48.845
Or how does it, how does it change how we talk with people,

186
00:15:48.905 --> 00:15:51.925
how we interact with people, how we relate to others?

187
00:15:53.025 --> 00:15:56.445
And even how, how should it steady our boat when the waves

188
00:15:56.785 --> 00:16:00.725
of suffering come to win?

189
00:16:02.505 --> 00:16:04.485
And then we'll close with a memory verse and a prayer,

190
00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:08.525
and then I'll hand it off to David for discussion.

191
00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:12.095
So when we talk about communicable attributes,

192
00:16:12.095 --> 00:16:15.535
we're asking this simple question of how is God like us?

193
00:16:16.395 --> 00:16:17.415
How is God like us?

194
00:16:18.955 --> 00:16:20.495
And a better, a better way to say that is,

195
00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:21.695
how are we like God?

196
00:16:22.995 --> 00:16:24.015
That's the better way.

197
00:16:25.595 --> 00:16:28.135
And these are the perfections of God in his goodness

198
00:16:28.135 --> 00:16:31.535
that he has chosen to share with us his people.

199
00:16:32.755 --> 00:16:36.615
And that doesn't mean that we share them in the same degree

200
00:16:36.675 --> 00:16:38.095
or the same level of perfection

201
00:16:38.095 --> 00:16:40.655
that he embodies these attributes to be.

202
00:16:41.405 --> 00:16:46.015
It's far away from that actually, this last Sunday, I,

203
00:16:46.135 --> 00:16:50.575
I was hanging out with my 9-year-old nephew, Grayson,

204
00:16:50.835 --> 00:16:53.775
and we were parked in the parking lot just over there.

205
00:16:53.915 --> 00:16:57.335
And I was waiting for Noel, our daughter,

206
00:16:57.355 --> 00:16:58.655
to get out of Bible study.

207
00:17:00.075 --> 00:17:01.855
And so I'm just having a conversation with Grace,

208
00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:04.655
and I asked him, I said, I said, you know, when,

209
00:17:04.655 --> 00:17:09.135
when my parents, uh, uh, the biggest thing

210
00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:12.095
for my parents and their wife was, uh,

211
00:17:12.235 --> 00:17:13.775
man stepping foot on the moon?

212
00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.935
And I said, for me, in my generation,

213
00:17:18.015 --> 00:17:21.135
probably the biggest thing is the invention of the internet

214
00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.175
that changed everything.

215
00:17:23.105 --> 00:17:26.925
And I said, I asked Grayson, I said, in your nine years,

216
00:17:27.515 --> 00:17:31.285
like what is the biggest thing that's happened in your life?

217
00:17:32.305 --> 00:17:35.125
And he thought, for about 20 seconds, I love people

218
00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:37.525
who are able to just like sit in silence

219
00:17:37.705 --> 00:17:39.165
and think for a while.

220
00:17:39.165 --> 00:17:40.805
He sat in silence for about 20 seconds

221
00:17:41.785 --> 00:17:46.765
and he said very clearly, he said, he said, there was a man

222
00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:49.885
who set the world record

223
00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:53.305
for the most number of hot dogs eaten.

224
00:17:55.285 --> 00:17:58.705
And and so

225
00:17:59.005 --> 00:18:01.585
inside I am dying laughing inside.

226
00:18:02.445 --> 00:18:07.425
Uh, but outside, I'm, I'm considering that to him

227
00:18:07.885 --> 00:18:10.705
as if that's, that's a serious answer.

228
00:18:10.885 --> 00:18:13.705
I'm like, oh yeah, he's nine.

229
00:18:14.775 --> 00:18:16.625
That is a serious answer. It is.

230
00:18:17.285 --> 00:18:19.825
And so I'm like, oh yeah, that's, that's a big deal.

231
00:18:19.835 --> 00:18:21.905
Let's look that up. And so I looked it up on Google

232
00:18:22.245 --> 00:18:25.885
and I said, you're right, gray, uh, Joey Chestnut,

233
00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:29.645
he ate 83 hot dogs in 10 minutes.

234
00:18:30.195 --> 00:18:32.925
Like that's incredible. That's incredible.

235
00:18:33.705 --> 00:18:35.125
That's not just the hot dog

236
00:18:35.125 --> 00:18:36.765
with the butt, it's the bun also.

237
00:18:36.795 --> 00:18:39.405
Yeah, it's the soaked in water.

238
00:18:40.545 --> 00:18:45.285
And, and really that's the difference between us

239
00:18:45.465 --> 00:18:46.765
and God.

240
00:18:49.935 --> 00:18:52.885
Jesus upholds galaxies,

241
00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:58.685
and we are upholding hot dogs in comparison.

242
00:19:01.465 --> 00:19:02.565
So we don't share

243
00:19:03.865 --> 00:19:07.245
or reflect God's attributes to the same degree that he does.

244
00:19:09.025 --> 00:19:13.005
And that's the point here. We reflect his attributes truly

245
00:19:14.065 --> 00:19:18.805
but faintly while he possesses

246
00:19:18.805 --> 00:19:20.685
them limitlessly.

247
00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:24.725
So think of it like this. When scripture calls us

248
00:19:24.725 --> 00:19:26.245
to holiness or love

249
00:19:26.305 --> 00:19:28.845
or justice, it's calling us to reflect

250
00:19:29.385 --> 00:19:31.445
who God already is.

251
00:19:31.595 --> 00:19:34.445
Leviticus 11, again, be holy

252
00:19:34.585 --> 00:19:37.925
for I am holy, so be holy.

253
00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:42.045
Or Ephesians five, one, be imitators

254
00:19:42.065 --> 00:19:43.325
of God as beloved children.

255
00:19:43.465 --> 00:19:45.885
So be imitators of God.

256
00:19:48.015 --> 00:19:52.955
And these passages imply that God's character must be

257
00:19:54.225 --> 00:19:57.595
admirable and also imitable

258
00:19:58.335 --> 00:20:02.555
to some measure, so admirable and imitable.

259
00:20:03.855 --> 00:20:06.275
And that's why we divide attributes into

260
00:20:06.275 --> 00:20:07.355
two broad categories.

261
00:20:07.355 --> 00:20:10.235
We saw last week that incommunicable attributes remind us

262
00:20:10.505 --> 00:20:13.155
that God is utterly unique.

263
00:20:13.385 --> 00:20:16.515
He's utterly distinct. He alone is infinite.

264
00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:20.355
He alone is eternal. He alone is unchangeable.

265
00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:24.755
He alone is omnipresent. He's everywhere.

266
00:20:25.895 --> 00:20:27.435
He alone is self existent.

267
00:20:27.815 --> 00:20:30.155
The theological term for that is asity.

268
00:20:31.015 --> 00:20:32.715
And he alone is all powerful.

269
00:20:32.825 --> 00:20:36.315
He's sovereign, and those are his

270
00:20:36.775 --> 00:20:38.275
incommunicable attributes.

271
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:41.635
And now we have communicable attributes.

272
00:20:43.095 --> 00:20:45.835
So communicable attributes show us what it means to

273
00:20:46.425 --> 00:20:49.885
display his attributes, his image in the world.

274
00:20:50.825 --> 00:20:53.365
And so here's, here's a quick comment for you.

275
00:20:53.475 --> 00:20:56.565
This division communicable incommunicable, this,

276
00:20:56.565 --> 00:20:57.845
it's not an absolute division.

277
00:20:58.235 --> 00:21:01.885
Some qualities that we see here tonight, like spirituality,

278
00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:05.285
indivisibility, they kind of sit on the edge of categories.

279
00:21:05.325 --> 00:21:07.725
There's some fuzzy ness to those boundaries.

280
00:21:08.345 --> 00:21:10.085
So the label doesn't really matter, but,

281
00:21:10.305 --> 00:21:13.725
but that we, it matters what that we rightly understand

282
00:21:14.295 --> 00:21:15.325
every attribute.

283
00:21:16.635 --> 00:21:18.015
So in this section, I want you to see

284
00:21:18.015 --> 00:21:21.655
that God's perfections are not abstract ideas.

285
00:21:24.135 --> 00:21:26.665
They are revelations of his character,

286
00:21:27.165 --> 00:21:31.625
and they always come with a plea

287
00:21:31.925 --> 00:21:34.745
and ask to respond like we respond

288
00:21:34.855 --> 00:21:36.345
because of these attributes.

289
00:21:37.215 --> 00:21:39.155
And that means that the, our study tonight

290
00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:43.555
of attributes is really an invitation to worship

291
00:21:44.425 --> 00:21:47.555
this theology that leads to doxology.

292
00:21:50.305 --> 00:21:53.005
And one more important theological note, uh,

293
00:21:53.005 --> 00:21:56.005
there's this term called modern retrieval work,

294
00:21:56.005 --> 00:21:59.905
which basically is, um, going back to,

295
00:22:00.805 --> 00:22:04.265
uh, historic Christianity for some of the theological ideas

296
00:22:04.295 --> 00:22:05.545
that were cemented back then

297
00:22:06.095 --> 00:22:07.905
because of modern retrieval work.

298
00:22:07.905 --> 00:22:12.305
There's been a lot of emphasis lately that God is not

299
00:22:13.225 --> 00:22:14.465
a collection of traits.

300
00:22:14.465 --> 00:22:16.345
And I'm sure this has already been addressed in this class,

301
00:22:16.965 --> 00:22:21.225
but God is not a collection of traits,

302
00:22:21.805 --> 00:22:24.265
but because of divine simplicity.

303
00:22:24.345 --> 00:22:26.025
I think that might be in your definition list

304
00:22:26.335 --> 00:22:27.985
because of divine simplicity,

305
00:22:27.985 --> 00:22:31.465
which I think Grudem calls Grudem is the author of

306
00:22:32.155 --> 00:22:34.145
Bible doctrine and systematic theology.

307
00:22:34.305 --> 00:22:36.025
I think that grudem calls it unity.

308
00:22:37.225 --> 00:22:40.155
It's more commonly known as divine simplicity,

309
00:22:42.665 --> 00:22:46.635
that God's attributes are not building blocks,

310
00:22:48.255 --> 00:22:51.555
but God is his attributes.

311
00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:54.555
God is his attributes.

312
00:22:54.555 --> 00:22:56.915
And I've heard it described like this, that if God isn't

313
00:22:57.825 --> 00:23:02.075
five pounds of holiness and five pounds of justice

314
00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:06.635
and five pounds of love, you know, he, he is love.

315
00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:10.595
He is justice, he is wrath.

316
00:23:13.015 --> 00:23:17.555
And every attribute is a qualification on

317
00:23:17.555 --> 00:23:18.755
every other attribute.

318
00:23:19.805 --> 00:23:24.105
So that means that his love, his holy love, his justice,

319
00:23:24.485 --> 00:23:29.425
his loving justice, his wrath, his righteous wrath.

320
00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:33.265
So keeping in mind that God is his attributes helps us

321
00:23:33.405 --> 00:23:37.065
to see his attributes as different angles

322
00:23:38.165 --> 00:23:39.945
on the same God.

323
00:23:42.135 --> 00:23:43.465
It's divine simplicity.

324
00:23:44.565 --> 00:23:47.965
So one more note here, some other large words,

325
00:23:49.945 --> 00:23:53.965
anthropomorphism are places in scripture that use

326
00:23:54.495 --> 00:23:56.965
human form language for God,

327
00:23:57.025 --> 00:23:58.445
for instance, the hand of the Lord.

328
00:23:59.225 --> 00:24:02.365
And then there's another term while anthropopathism

329
00:24:03.665 --> 00:24:07.165
use human emotion, words like love

330
00:24:07.165 --> 00:24:08.845
and jealousy, wrath and delight.

331
00:24:10.065 --> 00:24:11.845
God uses anthropomorphism

332
00:24:12.025 --> 00:24:13.485
and anthropopathism

333
00:24:13.665 --> 00:24:16.565
to help us understand his infinite nature.

334
00:24:17.465 --> 00:24:19.685
So when we hear God is love

335
00:24:20.865 --> 00:24:22.365
or God is jealous,

336
00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:27.165
we must remember we are hearing true words.

337
00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:28.845
Those are absolute truths,

338
00:24:30.065 --> 00:24:32.325
but they are in

339
00:24:32.325 --> 00:24:35.245
that analogical words like they're analogies,

340
00:24:37.575 --> 00:24:39.645
God's perfection expressed in categories

341
00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:40.645
that we can understand.

342
00:24:42.705 --> 00:24:44.685
And so this connects us.

343
00:24:44.685 --> 00:24:46.565
Let's take another little bit of a tangent here.

344
00:24:46.565 --> 00:24:49.205
This connects us to the classical doctrine

345
00:24:49.205 --> 00:24:50.565
of divine impassability,

346
00:24:50.565 --> 00:24:52.005
which Dan probably talked about last week.

347
00:24:52.795 --> 00:24:56.845
This, uh, divine impassability is an important guardrail

348
00:24:57.065 --> 00:25:01.925
to understand when we are talking about God's emotions.

349
00:25:03.705 --> 00:25:07.765
So impassability means that God cannot be overcome

350
00:25:08.385 --> 00:25:11.605
by passions or emotional changes from

351
00:25:11.715 --> 00:25:13.405
outside forces like we are.

352
00:25:14.725 --> 00:25:16.885
Somebody cuts us off in traffic or we get angry,

353
00:25:19.005 --> 00:25:21.505
and that was an outside force acting on us,

354
00:25:22.525 --> 00:25:24.585
nor is he, uh, nor is he watching.

355
00:25:24.725 --> 00:25:26.625
He shared and he's pleased with us One moment,

356
00:25:26.645 --> 00:25:29.425
and then we say a harsh word to one of our kids,

357
00:25:29.425 --> 00:25:32.145
and then he, then he suddenly burns with anger over

358
00:25:32.145 --> 00:25:34.025
what we just did in response, what we just did.

359
00:25:34.645 --> 00:25:35.905
That's not how it works.

360
00:25:37.685 --> 00:25:39.145
His love, his wrath

361
00:25:39.485 --> 00:25:41.025
and jealousy are not

362
00:25:42.065 --> 00:25:44.545
reactive involuntary feelings.

363
00:25:45.405 --> 00:25:47.385
So instead, God's emotions are active

364
00:25:47.645 --> 00:25:52.065
and voluntary expressions of his unchanging character.

365
00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:54.585
Remember, he is immutable, he is unchanging.

366
00:25:55.365 --> 00:25:57.545
So he is love.

367
00:25:58.845 --> 00:26:01.345
He doesn't fall into love.

368
00:26:03.365 --> 00:26:05.905
His wrath is his settled

369
00:26:07.225 --> 00:26:09.785
constant righteous opposition to sin,

370
00:26:10.465 --> 00:26:13.205
not an uncontrolled fit of rage.

371
00:26:15.225 --> 00:26:17.085
So this is distinct from the sun.

372
00:26:17.775 --> 00:26:19.685
Jesus Christ, who in his humanity

373
00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:22.845
was passable his humanity.

374
00:26:23.425 --> 00:26:26.245
He was passable, he truly could

375
00:26:26.385 --> 00:26:31.205
and did suffer hunger, sorrow and pain for our salvation.

376
00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:37.285
All right, let's jump into the attributes we have a lot.

377
00:26:39.055 --> 00:26:40.245
Let's continue on here.

378
00:26:41.545 --> 00:26:44.965
So his attributes de describing god's being,

379
00:26:46.615 --> 00:26:47.645
let's begin with those.

380
00:26:47.665 --> 00:26:49.045
So the first is spirituality.

381
00:26:49.045 --> 00:26:51.365
If God made the universal, what is he made of then?

382
00:26:51.785 --> 00:26:54.645
Um, is, does he have flesh and bones like us?

383
00:26:56.185 --> 00:26:58.845
Can the one who filled heaven

384
00:26:58.865 --> 00:27:02.685
and earth, can he be contained by space in some way?

385
00:27:04.305 --> 00:27:06.725
Can the creator be another creature among creatures?

386
00:27:07.265 --> 00:27:10.525
Can he be measured in dimensions or detected by instruments?

387
00:27:12.305 --> 00:27:15.685
No, scripture says that he is none of these.

388
00:27:16.185 --> 00:27:18.645
It says very plainly in John 4 24 that God

389
00:27:20.065 --> 00:27:21.605
is spirit.

390
00:27:22.465 --> 00:27:24.365
God is spirit.

391
00:27:24.875 --> 00:27:27.805
That means that he is not made of matter.

392
00:27:28.305 --> 00:27:30.885
He has no parts, no dimensions.

393
00:27:31.185 --> 00:27:34.925
He cannot, cannot be perceived

394
00:27:35.185 --> 00:27:36.405
by our physical senses.

395
00:27:37.575 --> 00:27:39.475
So not only can he not be perceived,

396
00:27:40.015 --> 00:27:44.355
but his kind of existence is more excellent than

397
00:27:44.915 --> 00:27:46.515
anything else in creation.

398
00:27:47.405 --> 00:27:52.025
And this is why idolatry is so offensive to picture God

399
00:27:52.025 --> 00:27:55.385
as an object or an image only serves to

400
00:27:56.105 --> 00:27:57.425
diminish who he is.

401
00:27:58.525 --> 00:28:00.865
So the second command we see forbids grave and images

402
00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:03.345
because God's being is unlike

403
00:28:03.865 --> 00:28:05.825
anything else in all of creation.

404
00:28:07.605 --> 00:28:08.985
And I've heard it described this way,

405
00:28:09.075 --> 00:28:12.145
God's being is categorically other.

406
00:28:13.695 --> 00:28:17.305
He's not just bigger and better than our own being.

407
00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:19.425
He is categorically other.

408
00:28:20.325 --> 00:28:23.025
So again, our language about God, we,

409
00:28:23.045 --> 00:28:24.465
we talked about it earlier, it's

410
00:28:24.465 --> 00:28:27.185
therefore it's, it's analogical, it's analogy.

411
00:28:28.445 --> 00:28:30.425
So when scripture speaks of God's hand

412
00:28:30.605 --> 00:28:33.665
or his eyes, it is only giving us something

413
00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:35.305
that we can understand.

414
00:28:36.305 --> 00:28:39.035
Remember that? So that means

415
00:28:39.145 --> 00:28:43.875
that anthropomorphic texts are true and they are fitting,

416
00:28:44.135 --> 00:28:47.435
but there are not literal body parts to God.

417
00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:52.155
Same chronicle 16, nine says, for the eyes of the Lord run

418
00:28:52.175 --> 00:28:55.835
to and fro throughout the whole earth to give strong support

419
00:28:55.835 --> 00:28:57.555
to those whose hearts are blameless beforehand.

420
00:28:58.935 --> 00:29:01.875
And it's not his literal eyes

421
00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:04.075
running to and fro.

422
00:29:04.345 --> 00:29:08.955
Okay? So Jesus links God's spirituality to how we worship

423
00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:11.515
to the Samaritan woman, he says

424
00:29:11.515 --> 00:29:16.235
that Father seeks worshipers in spirit and in what truth.

425
00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:20.035
And it's not dependent on where we do it

426
00:29:20.995 --> 00:29:24.095
or the quality of how we perform it.

427
00:29:25.665 --> 00:29:28.005
So gospel centered worship, it's important to know,

428
00:29:28.145 --> 00:29:30.405
is it's shaped by God's word.

429
00:29:30.635 --> 00:29:34.325
It's empowered by the spirit. It's not image driven.

430
00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:38.605
It's not chasing the, you know, sensations of some kind.

431
00:29:39.905 --> 00:29:43.005
So spirituality does another thing in, in that it clarifies

432
00:29:44.075 --> 00:29:46.845
what we are as his image bearers.

433
00:29:46.865 --> 00:29:50.765
We have spirits and know and love and, and will.

434
00:29:50.765 --> 00:29:54.365
And by the Holy Spirit, we are united to Christ in a bond

435
00:29:54.365 --> 00:29:57.445
that's more real than sight.

436
00:29:59.945 --> 00:30:03.565
One Corinthians one, uh, six 17 says that we're joined

437
00:30:03.865 --> 00:30:06.925
to the Lord and we become one spirit with him.

438
00:30:08.305 --> 00:30:10.085
So in death, believers are away from body

439
00:30:10.185 --> 00:30:11.485
and at home with the Lord.

440
00:30:11.985 --> 00:30:14.845
And that presumes as you would expect, that

441
00:30:16.775 --> 00:30:19.005
there is a spiritual presence

442
00:30:19.145 --> 00:30:22.365
before a bodily resurrection.

443
00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:27.505
And that should encourage us to persevere in suffering

444
00:30:28.445 --> 00:30:31.135
because fellowship with God does not depend on any kind

445
00:30:31.135 --> 00:30:33.495
of material or physical circumstance.

446
00:30:34.805 --> 00:30:37.975
Okay? So that's attribute one, spirituality.

447
00:30:37.995 --> 00:30:40.975
The second is invisibility. Invisibility.

448
00:30:42.075 --> 00:30:44.775
And so the first question automatically for most would be

449
00:30:44.795 --> 00:30:47.095
how can, how can invisibility be communicated?

450
00:30:47.475 --> 00:30:49.135
And every kid on the planet would be like,

451
00:30:49.135 --> 00:30:50.335
well, sign me up for that.

452
00:30:51.735 --> 00:30:53.775
I would love that. But let's think

453
00:30:53.775 --> 00:30:55.095
through this for a second here.

454
00:30:56.205 --> 00:31:00.855
John one 18 says that no one has ever seen God

455
00:31:01.945 --> 00:31:04.775
verse Timothy six 16 calls him the one

456
00:31:04.915 --> 00:31:08.135
who dwells in unapproachable light.

457
00:31:10.075 --> 00:31:13.975
So that means God's essence cannot

458
00:31:14.915 --> 00:31:18.895
be seen by our eyes either now or in glory.

459
00:31:19.155 --> 00:31:22.535
We cannot. And yet God

460
00:31:23.425 --> 00:31:26.255
still shows himself in visible ways.

461
00:31:26.435 --> 00:31:28.135
And so we see that in the Old Testament

462
00:31:28.135 --> 00:31:31.095
where he appeared in the offs.

463
00:31:31.965 --> 00:31:33.415
What, what is it? The offing?

464
00:31:34.035 --> 00:31:35.535
Who knows what a, the offing is

465
00:31:38.675 --> 00:31:40.375
God showing up in person before Jesus.

466
00:31:41.125 --> 00:31:43.775
Yeah, God showing up in a visible manifestation

467
00:31:43.775 --> 00:31:45.775
before Jesus comes around, right?

468
00:31:45.775 --> 00:31:49.375
That's exactly right. And Jesus effectively ends the

469
00:31:49.485 --> 00:31:50.655
offings, right?

470
00:31:51.475 --> 00:31:54.735
Um, and so

471
00:31:55.695 --> 00:31:59.735
a theophany temporary visible manifestation of God,

472
00:32:00.755 --> 00:32:02.695
God appeared in theophany

473
00:32:02.695 --> 00:32:06.015
as we saw in the Old Testament angel of the Lord, a pillar

474
00:32:06.275 --> 00:32:10.455
of cloud and fire, the glory cloud over the mercy sea.

475
00:32:11.075 --> 00:32:14.855
And these manifestations are real revelations.

476
00:32:15.155 --> 00:32:16.775
But are they complete?

477
00:32:18.475 --> 00:32:21.475
No, they're not complete unveiling of

478
00:32:21.495 --> 00:32:23.155
who God is, of God's being.

479
00:32:23.575 --> 00:32:27.675
And we ultimately see that this supreme manifestation

480
00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:30.475
is Jesus Christ himself.

481
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:33.235
The Son is the image of the invisible God.

482
00:32:33.375 --> 00:32:38.035
And whoever has seen the son, has seen who the Father

483
00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:42.365
in that incarnate revelation.

484
00:32:42.425 --> 00:32:44.645
So most theologians would, would strip,

485
00:32:45.025 --> 00:32:48.805
the theologian would stress that incarnation is not

486
00:32:49.765 --> 00:32:53.785
a theo, but what would be called in in flesh.

487
00:32:54.685 --> 00:32:58.065
So God in the flesh, eternal son, assuming

488
00:32:58.825 --> 00:33:02.385
complete human nature without confusing natures

489
00:33:03.925 --> 00:33:07.825
In Christ, we see that invisibility becomes saving

490
00:33:08.635 --> 00:33:13.145
visibility where God makes himself noble, makes himself

491
00:33:13.735 --> 00:33:17.015
near without cc to be God.

492
00:33:18.795 --> 00:33:21.655
So how then will we see God in the age to to come?

493
00:33:23.615 --> 00:33:26.135
I don't know about you, but I love Revelation 22.

494
00:33:27.535 --> 00:33:28.875
Almost more than anything,

495
00:33:30.835 --> 00:33:33.355
scripture promises this beatific vision

496
00:33:34.535 --> 00:33:38.235
or says they shall see his face,

497
00:33:45.015 --> 00:33:49.715
and yet even then we will not comprehend his essence,

498
00:33:50.065 --> 00:33:52.795
exhaust of the incompletion in that moment.

499
00:33:54.935 --> 00:33:57.595
So here again, we see, we talked about this earlier,

500
00:33:58.375 --> 00:34:01.795
we see another beautiful anthropomorphism.

501
00:34:01.895 --> 00:34:05.395
So seeing his face isn't about physical sight,

502
00:34:05.415 --> 00:34:09.995
but a direct personal unhindered experience of God's glory.

503
00:34:11.165 --> 00:34:14.875
God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ is the light

504
00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:18.795
that transforms us from one degree glory to another.

505
00:34:20.905 --> 00:34:22.285
So here's the takeaway from these,

506
00:34:22.285 --> 00:34:24.725
these first two attributes, spirituality and invisibility.

507
00:34:24.985 --> 00:34:29.325
God, his being is utterly done beyond creation,

508
00:34:29.505 --> 00:34:33.245
and yet he graciously makes himself known to us.

509
00:34:33.865 --> 00:34:36.325
He calls us to respond and worship,

510
00:34:37.105 --> 00:34:39.245
and he calls us to live in hope

511
00:34:39.665 --> 00:34:42.605
of seeing his face forever.

512
00:34:46.225 --> 00:34:48.645
So now we turn onto the mental attributes is

513
00:34:48.835 --> 00:34:50.405
another category here.

514
00:34:51.705 --> 00:34:55.685
Mental attributes show God's perfect knowing, his wise

515
00:34:56.285 --> 00:34:58.285
choosing his truthful speaking.

516
00:34:58.905 --> 00:35:00.885
And the first attribute under that umbrella

517
00:35:00.985 --> 00:35:05.725
of mental attributes is knowledge or omniscience.

518
00:35:06.745 --> 00:35:08.405
And I know we just said omniscience

519
00:35:09.465 --> 00:35:11.245
for incommunicable attributes.

520
00:35:11.925 --> 00:35:14.165
Remember there's a little bit of fuzziness

521
00:35:14.425 --> 00:35:16.085
around these categorizations.

522
00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:18.965
So God's omniscience his perfect knowledge,

523
00:35:19.505 --> 00:35:22.565
here's the definition of that God fully knows himself

524
00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:27.405
and all things actual and possible in one simple

525
00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:28.765
and eternal act.

526
00:35:29.795 --> 00:35:32.685
What does that mean? That means first of all,

527
00:35:32.715 --> 00:35:36.405
that he knows everything, everything that is

528
00:35:36.585 --> 00:35:38.325
and everything that ever could.

529
00:35:38.905 --> 00:35:43.365
He knows it all. Hebrews four 13 says, no, create,

530
00:35:43.505 --> 00:35:45.925
no creature is hidden from his sight.

531
00:35:45.945 --> 00:35:49.005
And I've, I've heard it described this way that that

532
00:35:49.005 --> 00:35:53.285
that truth can be a profound comfort to us.

533
00:35:53.905 --> 00:35:55.885
And it can be a holy terror.

534
00:35:58.835 --> 00:36:02.485
It's a comfort because your life is never miscalculated

535
00:36:02.585 --> 00:36:03.685
by a loving God.

536
00:36:03.945 --> 00:36:05.965
But it's also a terror

537
00:36:05.965 --> 00:36:10.165
because no secret sin escapes his gaze.

538
00:36:12.985 --> 00:36:17.485
Second, God knows all this in one simple and internal act.

539
00:36:18.065 --> 00:36:21.685
So he isn't some Google supercomputer that has

540
00:36:21.685 --> 00:36:23.045
to look things up or learn.

541
00:36:23.305 --> 00:36:26.805
Now he knows everything all at once

542
00:36:28.315 --> 00:36:29.445
from all eternity.

543
00:36:30.385 --> 00:36:33.565
He never learns and he never forgets.

544
00:36:33.565 --> 00:36:37.285
And it's a very different way of saying what you might say

545
00:36:37.285 --> 00:36:40.125
of some, some guy like that guy he never learns.

546
00:36:41.025 --> 00:36:43.885
No, it's he never learns because he knows it all.

547
00:36:46.465 --> 00:36:47.605
So how do we imitate this?

548
00:36:48.585 --> 00:36:51.965
So since knowledge is a communicable attribute, we're called

549
00:36:52.025 --> 00:36:53.565
to reflect it.

550
00:36:56.035 --> 00:36:58.335
And so we do this by pursuing true knowledge.

551
00:36:58.335 --> 00:37:00.015
We renew our minds with scripture

552
00:37:01.275 --> 00:37:05.495
and we grow in the knowledge of God who already knows us.

553
00:37:05.495 --> 00:37:09.575
Perfect. Second mental attribute is wisdom.

554
00:37:10.235 --> 00:37:12.415
So if God's knowledge is knowing all the facts

555
00:37:12.435 --> 00:37:15.415
and wisdom is the perfect skill of applying them.

556
00:37:16.465 --> 00:37:18.645
And the definition is this, God always

557
00:37:19.395 --> 00:37:22.845
chooses the best goals and the best means to those goals.

558
00:37:24.415 --> 00:37:29.395
So we see this wisdom displays supremely at the cross where,

559
00:37:29.935 --> 00:37:31.955
uh, what looked like foolishness

560
00:37:34.655 --> 00:37:38.155
to the world was actually God's plan of redemption.

561
00:37:39.255 --> 00:37:42.075
And we see it working in the lives of our, of the promise

562
00:37:42.135 --> 00:37:45.475
of Romans 8 28, where God is masterfully

563
00:37:46.105 --> 00:37:50.635
weaving together all things, even suffering

564
00:37:52.225 --> 00:37:53.525
for our ultimate good,

565
00:37:55.665 --> 00:37:57.645
to make us more like Jesus for his glory.

566
00:37:58.565 --> 00:38:00.785
And so since wisdom is a communicable attribute,

567
00:38:00.805 --> 00:38:01.865
we can grow in it.

568
00:38:02.125 --> 00:38:06.785
We can, we imitate it when we ask God for wisdom, knowing

569
00:38:06.785 --> 00:38:07.985
that it gives it generously.

570
00:38:09.045 --> 00:38:11.585
Almost every single elder meeting, we, we pray

571
00:38:11.585 --> 00:38:13.465
to God asking for wisdom.

572
00:38:17.005 --> 00:38:18.265
And what does Proverbs say?

573
00:38:18.285 --> 00:38:21.145
The beginning of wisdom is Proverbs nine 10 says, the fear

574
00:38:21.145 --> 00:38:24.145
of the Lord is the beginning of what is wisdom.

575
00:38:26.605 --> 00:38:30.225
So the fear of the Lord is a, a reverent awe, the desires

576
00:38:30.225 --> 00:38:32.545
to honor him in all we do.

577
00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:35.725
And that is where wisdom begins.

578
00:38:37.545 --> 00:38:40.405
So finally, when, when we can't understand his wisdom in our

579
00:38:40.405 --> 00:38:43.725
circumstances, our call is simple.

580
00:38:45.065 --> 00:38:47.565
We trust and we obey.

581
00:38:48.825 --> 00:38:52.045
So we are to not lean on our own understanding.

582
00:38:52.325 --> 00:38:55.925
Scripture says, but on our faithful creator who's infinitely

583
00:38:56.475 --> 00:39:01.325
wise, the third mental attribute is truthfulness,

584
00:39:02.435 --> 00:39:03.565
including faithfulness.

585
00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:07.805
It's part of, uh, part of the truthfulness attribute

586
00:39:08.065 --> 00:39:09.125
to God is the true God.

587
00:39:09.185 --> 00:39:10.445
All all of his knowledge

588
00:39:10.445 --> 00:39:14.725
and word to true he is the final standard of truth.

589
00:39:15.555 --> 00:39:17.965
He's faithful keeps his promises.

590
00:39:18.545 --> 00:39:22.245
We imitate this by loving truth, by hating falsehood,

591
00:39:22.805 --> 00:39:24.045
guarding our speech.

592
00:39:28.175 --> 00:39:29.525
We'll move on to moral attributes.

593
00:39:29.625 --> 00:39:30.725
I'm I'm follow a little bit behind.

594
00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:34.735
So I'm gonna kind of pick up the pace, uh, moral attributes.

595
00:39:35.315 --> 00:39:37.135
So now we we're at moral attributes.

596
00:39:37.155 --> 00:39:39.815
We show God's goodness, his love, holiness,

597
00:39:40.165 --> 00:39:42.135
justice, jealousy, and wrath.

598
00:39:42.155 --> 00:39:46.055
And the first is goodness, which under goodness has

599
00:39:46.595 --> 00:39:50.335
the umbrella, uh, including mercy and grace.

600
00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:53.855
So God is the final standard of good.

601
00:39:54.715 --> 00:39:56.735
All he does is worthy of approval.

602
00:39:56.825 --> 00:40:01.415
James one 17 says, every good gift, every perfect gift

603
00:40:01.985 --> 00:40:06.575
comes from above coming down from the father of lights

604
00:40:06.575 --> 00:40:09.895
with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.

605
00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:14.255
And so we see that he is good and he is unchanging.

606
00:40:15.195 --> 00:40:17.735
He is unchanging good.

607
00:40:19.675 --> 00:40:21.735
And from the beginning God declared his works

608
00:40:21.755 --> 00:40:22.775
to be very good.

609
00:40:23.275 --> 00:40:25.535
One of my favorite Psalms in Psalm 84

610
00:40:25.755 --> 00:40:29.415
or says He withholds no good thing from those

611
00:40:29.435 --> 00:40:30.615
who walk uprightly.

612
00:40:33.835 --> 00:40:37.855
And this goodness isn't some, uh, abstract con concept.

613
00:40:38.085 --> 00:40:41.215
It's an active benevolence to his people.

614
00:40:43.075 --> 00:40:46.655
And we see mercy and grace under this umbrella as well.

615
00:40:46.795 --> 00:40:48.375
And you know, mercy

616
00:40:48.715 --> 00:40:52.775
and grace, mercy is his goodness toward those who

617
00:40:53.435 --> 00:40:55.615
are in in misery and distress.

618
00:40:56.305 --> 00:40:57.935
Grace is his goodness toward those

619
00:40:57.955 --> 00:41:00.255
who only deserve punishment.

620
00:41:00.255 --> 00:41:02.095
You've heard the the shorter definitions.

621
00:41:02.305 --> 00:41:05.695
Mercy is not giving people what they deserve.

622
00:41:05.795 --> 00:41:08.775
And grace is giving people what they don't deserve.

623
00:41:10.475 --> 00:41:13.255
And both are seen in Exodus 34, 6, it's where it says

624
00:41:13.795 --> 00:41:15.775
he is a God, merciful

625
00:41:16.195 --> 00:41:19.535
and gracious, slow to anger, bounding in steadfast love.

626
00:41:20.155 --> 00:41:23.375
And so his love is this steadfast love.

627
00:41:23.375 --> 00:41:25.015
You've heard the, uh,

628
00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:27.655
Hebrew word has said it's a steadfast

629
00:41:27.655 --> 00:41:28.815
love that he has for us.

630
00:41:29.765 --> 00:41:31.375
It's a love that does not let go.

631
00:41:32.235 --> 00:41:33.885
And so we also see God's goodness

632
00:41:34.565 --> 00:41:36.925
demonstrated in things like, uh, common grace.

633
00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:41.885
Who knows what common grace is as a term?

634
00:41:42.405 --> 00:41:45.805
Everyone, sorry everyone, whatever you want.

635
00:41:45.865 --> 00:41:48.165
It doesn't matter if you're a believer or unbeliever it.

636
00:41:48.165 --> 00:41:52.005
Uh, it's Justin. Yeah, yeah, absolutely rains.

637
00:41:52.385 --> 00:41:55.245
Sun, rain just unjust, doesn't matter.

638
00:41:56.945 --> 00:42:00.765
And so when his, when what God has

639
00:42:01.045 --> 00:42:05.085
provided seems severe, his heart remains good.

640
00:42:06.545 --> 00:42:07.685
And how do we imitate this?

641
00:42:07.685 --> 00:42:09.885
Well, we imitate this by doing good to all,

642
00:42:10.655 --> 00:42:11.885
especially to who?

643
00:42:13.305 --> 00:42:15.165
To those in the household of faith.

644
00:42:16.535 --> 00:42:17.845
Mercy begins by seeing

645
00:42:17.845 --> 00:42:19.685
and drawing near to those who are suffering.

646
00:42:19.735 --> 00:42:22.365
Grace looks like forgiving the undeserving

647
00:42:22.365 --> 00:42:24.885
and giving beyond what can be given back.

648
00:42:29.665 --> 00:42:31.445
We practice it in truth and justice.

649
00:42:32.465 --> 00:42:37.245
Uh, we're kind to people as he's kind to us, knowing

650
00:42:37.275 --> 00:42:39.805
that kindness is meant to lead us to repentance.

651
00:42:42.105 --> 00:42:45.725
And that is his goodness. Second moral attribute is love.

652
00:42:46.225 --> 00:42:47.845
And first John, we see this

653
00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:52.605
powerful statement about God's character when it says God

654
00:42:53.105 --> 00:42:54.765
is love.

655
00:42:57.585 --> 00:43:00.965
And again, we know that to mean that it is in concert with

656
00:43:01.865 --> 00:43:04.765
in fullness with every other attribute.

657
00:43:05.745 --> 00:43:08.845
So it's not crowding out his other attributes.

658
00:43:10.465 --> 00:43:12.645
God eternally gives of himself to others.

659
00:43:12.825 --> 00:43:15.725
And this love existed forever within the trinity

660
00:43:15.865 --> 00:43:17.005
and then it was shown to us.

661
00:43:18.145 --> 00:43:21.765
And his love is radical 'cause it moved.

662
00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:26.685
First one John four 10 says this, in,

663
00:43:26.785 --> 00:43:28.285
in this is love.

664
00:43:28.425 --> 00:43:31.645
Not that we have loved God, but that he loved us.

665
00:43:33.345 --> 00:43:35.725
And how is his love ultimately, ultimately proven?

666
00:43:35.795 --> 00:43:38.485
Well, his love is proven on the cross.

667
00:43:39.105 --> 00:43:41.965
Romans five eight declares, God shows his love for us

668
00:43:42.345 --> 00:43:45.525
and that while we were still centered, he died for us.

669
00:43:45.545 --> 00:43:50.165
Christ died for us, was an act of holy love in

670
00:43:50.165 --> 00:43:53.525
that moment, satisfying God's justice in order

671
00:43:53.525 --> 00:43:55.445
to give us the greatest gift possible.

672
00:43:57.865 --> 00:43:59.445
So as his children we're called

673
00:43:59.445 --> 00:44:02.325
to imitate this self-giving love.

674
00:44:02.705 --> 00:44:06.245
And so we love God back through obedience to his commands.

675
00:44:06.245 --> 00:44:10.685
We love others through a costly, practical form of love.

676
00:44:11.345 --> 00:44:13.285
Not just with Word but indeed

677
00:44:13.505 --> 00:44:17.515
and in truth the

678
00:44:17.515 --> 00:44:18.555
third moral attribute.

679
00:44:18.635 --> 00:44:20.355
Holiness. Holiness.

680
00:44:20.895 --> 00:44:23.315
And so, uh, this is one of those, this is one

681
00:44:23.315 --> 00:44:27.915
of those attributes that um, people often list first,

682
00:44:29.605 --> 00:44:32.445
which I probably would again, not that it's

683
00:44:33.145 --> 00:44:35.445
the most dominant in some cases,

684
00:44:35.705 --> 00:44:38.325
but it is the umbrella attribute.

685
00:44:39.025 --> 00:44:41.005
It colors every other attribute.

686
00:44:43.015 --> 00:44:47.445
God's holiness means that he is both holy other, again,

687
00:44:47.725 --> 00:44:52.045
W-H-O-L-Y, holy other, he's transcendent,

688
00:44:52.045 --> 00:44:54.525
he's set apart, he's incomparable

689
00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:57.485
and he is also the one who calls us to be holy.

690
00:44:57.585 --> 00:45:02.165
As he's holy God is separated from sin

691
00:45:02.225 --> 00:45:04.085
and he is devoted to his own honor.

692
00:45:07.185 --> 00:45:11.885
And so holiness

693
00:45:13.725 --> 00:45:17.525
includes separation from evil

694
00:45:18.345 --> 00:45:20.765
and devotion to God.

695
00:45:21.745 --> 00:45:23.085
That's what holiness looks like.

696
00:45:24.345 --> 00:45:29.205
And this vision that we see, the sfo crying, holy, holy,

697
00:45:29.875 --> 00:45:31.885
holy in Isaiah six

698
00:45:32.845 --> 00:45:35.925
emphasizes this infinite transcendence.

699
00:45:38.065 --> 00:45:41.645
And Peter echoes Leviticus be holy, for I am holy.

700
00:45:42.345 --> 00:45:46.885
And this is a, a call to us to be, uh, ethical

701
00:45:47.705 --> 00:45:49.485
and holy and set apart.

702
00:45:50.825 --> 00:45:54.405
So in this sense, holiness gathers up

703
00:45:55.145 --> 00:45:56.325
all the other attributes.

704
00:45:56.385 --> 00:46:00.005
His love is holy love. His justice is holy justice.

705
00:46:00.105 --> 00:46:03.125
His mercy is holy mercy.

706
00:46:04.905 --> 00:46:07.285
And so he causes people to be a holy nation

707
00:46:07.905 --> 00:46:09.245
set apart to him.

708
00:46:09.265 --> 00:46:13.885
And so we see that holiness is both a status granted

709
00:46:14.425 --> 00:46:17.565
and it's also a calling to pursue.

710
00:46:18.785 --> 00:46:22.285
We pursue holiness by resisting sin

711
00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:25.725
and by devoting ourselves to his glory.

712
00:46:26.705 --> 00:46:30.605
And this isn't optional, holiness isn't optional.

713
00:46:31.625 --> 00:46:35.005
It is the necessary evidence of belonging to God.

714
00:46:37.605 --> 00:46:42.085
Holiness functions as a distinguishing mark

715
00:46:42.225 --> 00:46:43.245
of god's being.

716
00:46:43.745 --> 00:46:48.445
And a it's a call. It's a full call to his people.

717
00:46:50.345 --> 00:46:53.565
The fourth moral attribute we see is righteousness

718
00:46:54.385 --> 00:46:55.805
or justice.

719
00:46:56.145 --> 00:46:59.325
You see those two talked about in tandem.

720
00:47:00.825 --> 00:47:03.765
So what does this mean? God always acts in accordance with

721
00:47:03.765 --> 00:47:07.445
what is right and he himself is the final standard for

722
00:47:07.445 --> 00:47:08.605
what is right.

723
00:47:09.155 --> 00:47:12.045
That means he must punish sin

724
00:47:12.105 --> 00:47:13.845
or else he would be unrighteous.

725
00:47:14.505 --> 00:47:16.885
And the cross shows that he is righteous.

726
00:47:16.885 --> 00:47:20.925
Jesus bore our punishment for sin so

727
00:47:20.925 --> 00:47:23.165
that God could be just and a justifier.

728
00:47:26.585 --> 00:47:30.765
And RC Spro

729
00:47:31.355 --> 00:47:36.245
clarified that true justice is giving each their due.

730
00:47:39.265 --> 00:47:41.725
And so there's a interesting diagram.

731
00:47:42.005 --> 00:47:44.885
I saw him draw and I'll, I'll try to draw it.

732
00:47:45.825 --> 00:47:50.685
Um, where it talks about, if you imagine justice,

733
00:47:54.755 --> 00:47:55.565
this might help us

734
00:47:55.655 --> 00:48:00.205
understand this a little bit better.

735
00:48:00.345 --> 00:48:02.685
So we have justice, everything within this

736
00:48:02.685 --> 00:48:04.925
circle is justice.

737
00:48:07.355 --> 00:48:10.325
Outside of the circle is what you would call

738
00:48:13.265 --> 00:48:13.805
non justice

739
00:48:20.295 --> 00:48:22.485
makes sense, justice and non justice.

740
00:48:24.465 --> 00:48:27.125
But within the category of non justice,

741
00:48:28.195 --> 00:48:29.765
there's two halves to this.

742
00:48:30.545 --> 00:48:32.765
So we see two halves

743
00:48:33.355 --> 00:48:33.645
Here

744
00:48:38.865 --> 00:48:41.925
And on this side we see injustice,

745
00:48:45.095 --> 00:48:49.005
which is against the heart of God and we see

746
00:48:54.215 --> 00:48:55.645
grace and mercy.

747
00:49:03.605 --> 00:49:05.045
I thought that was a helpful view

748
00:49:05.145 --> 00:49:09.485
to understand how God works.

749
00:49:09.815 --> 00:49:14.445
Grace and mercy stand outside of his justice.

750
00:49:16.385 --> 00:49:17.565
But we see later,

751
00:49:17.825 --> 00:49:22.325
and we saw it already in Exodus 34, how he

752
00:49:22.985 --> 00:49:26.805
is just and has to be just his very character,

753
00:49:26.905 --> 00:49:28.205
his very character.

754
00:49:28.345 --> 00:49:30.365
He is justice.

755
00:49:38.015 --> 00:49:40.915
And so this attribute

756
00:49:42.215 --> 00:49:43.275
of righteousness

757
00:49:43.415 --> 00:49:46.755
or justice gives us hope that the judge of the earth will do

758
00:49:46.825 --> 00:49:49.115
what is right and uh,

759
00:49:50.215 --> 00:49:52.715
and fear really knowing that he will not

760
00:49:53.135 --> 00:49:54.835
by any means clear the guilty.

761
00:49:56.815 --> 00:49:58.075
So we imitate his justice.

762
00:49:58.145 --> 00:50:01.635
When we act with fairness, with integrity, with equity,

763
00:50:01.745 --> 00:50:05.715
when we defend the oppressed, we judge Without partiality

764
00:50:06.415 --> 00:50:08.795
we show mercy and without abandoning truth.

765
00:50:10.695 --> 00:50:13.075
The fifth moral attribute is jealousy. Jealousy.

766
00:50:13.895 --> 00:50:16.755
And so God continually, continually seeks

767
00:50:16.755 --> 00:50:17.875
to protect his own honor.

768
00:50:18.575 --> 00:50:21.995
And unlike human jealousy which is rooted in pride,

769
00:50:22.565 --> 00:50:23.875
God's jealousy is right

770
00:50:24.105 --> 00:50:27.245
because he alone deserves all worship.

771
00:50:29.825 --> 00:50:34.325
And this is a perfect outworking of the earlier term.

772
00:50:34.665 --> 00:50:38.535
His impassability, his impassability.

773
00:50:38.605 --> 00:50:41.975
It's not a reactive insecure passion,

774
00:50:42.555 --> 00:50:45.015
but a righteous and a settled

775
00:50:45.195 --> 00:50:49.135
and a constant expression of his unchanging character.

776
00:50:50.275 --> 00:50:53.895
So he imitated jealousy when we are zealous for his glory

777
00:50:53.955 --> 00:50:56.895
and we are offended when he is dishonored.

778
00:51:01.635 --> 00:51:05.215
So that is jealousy. Sixth moral attribute is wrath.

779
00:51:06.355 --> 00:51:08.815
God intensely

780
00:51:09.865 --> 00:51:11.695
hates sin.

781
00:51:13.755 --> 00:51:15.055
Romans one, the wrath

782
00:51:15.075 --> 00:51:18.135
of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness

783
00:51:18.155 --> 00:51:20.455
and unrighteousness of men who

784
00:51:20.555 --> 00:51:22.935
by their unconsciousness suppressed the truth.

785
00:51:23.675 --> 00:51:26.295
And so if you recall God's impassability,

786
00:51:26.395 --> 00:51:29.855
we know this wrath isn't an uncontrolled rage

787
00:51:30.955 --> 00:51:33.175
but is holy and it's constant

788
00:51:33.195 --> 00:51:35.575
and it is a settled opposition, evil.

789
00:51:36.355 --> 00:51:38.135
And we see that wrath is the flip side

790
00:51:38.135 --> 00:51:39.575
of his holiness and is justice.

791
00:51:41.355 --> 00:51:43.215
And we thank God for his wrath

792
00:51:43.215 --> 00:51:47.255
because of God who does not hate sin, wouldn't be worthy

793
00:51:47.275 --> 00:51:51.555
of worship for believers, Christ

794
00:51:52.255 --> 00:51:55.235
has born God's wrath on our behalf.

795
00:51:55.615 --> 00:51:59.915
It says Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come

796
00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:02.455
and we imitate his wrath.

797
00:52:02.675 --> 00:52:06.935
Not by personal vengeance, but by hating.

798
00:52:08.555 --> 00:52:09.655
Hating evil

799
00:52:09.835 --> 00:52:12.925
and injustice while showing

800
00:52:13.175 --> 00:52:15.005
mercy to sinners.

801
00:52:16.145 --> 00:52:17.165
So here's the takeaway.

802
00:52:17.415 --> 00:52:21.285
God's moral perfection show us what is right, pure and good

803
00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:23.765
and by the spirit we are being conformed

804
00:52:23.765 --> 00:52:26.885
to his likeness in these very attributes.

805
00:52:28.665 --> 00:52:30.995
Alright, attributes of purpose.

806
00:52:31.265 --> 00:52:34.995
Purpose and these display God's willing, his deciding,

807
00:52:35.735 --> 00:52:37.515
his empowering of all things.

808
00:52:37.735 --> 00:52:39.075
The first is will

809
00:52:40.305 --> 00:52:44.485
and the definition of will is the ability to decide and act.

810
00:52:45.585 --> 00:52:48.725
So God's will is that by which he approves

811
00:52:48.785 --> 00:52:52.725
and determines to bring about every action necessary

812
00:52:52.825 --> 00:52:54.405
for himself and all creation.

813
00:52:54.405 --> 00:52:57.805
We read in Ephesians one who he works

814
00:52:58.705 --> 00:53:00.805
all things according to the council of his will.

815
00:53:02.745 --> 00:53:04.965
In scripture, God's will is the ultimate

816
00:53:04.965 --> 00:53:06.445
reason for what exists.

817
00:53:06.515 --> 00:53:10.925
What occurs creation itself is by his will.

818
00:53:10.925 --> 00:53:14.125
Revelation four 11, worthy are you owe our Lord

819
00:53:14.305 --> 00:53:17.765
and God to receive glory and honor

820
00:53:18.025 --> 00:53:20.725
and power for you, created all things

821
00:53:20.825 --> 00:53:24.445
and by your will they existed

822
00:53:24.785 --> 00:53:27.405
and were created by your will.

823
00:53:29.395 --> 00:53:31.805
Even the events surrounding Jesus' death came about like

824
00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:33.925
God's hand and plan.

825
00:53:35.305 --> 00:53:40.005
And this surprises some Acts 4 27

826
00:53:40.005 --> 00:53:42.965
through 28 it says, is

827
00:53:45.275 --> 00:53:48.805
your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed both pared

828
00:53:48.805 --> 00:53:50.845
and conscious Pilate along with the gentiles

829
00:53:50.985 --> 00:53:54.525
and the peoples of Israel to do whatever your hand, God,

830
00:53:54.845 --> 00:53:57.805
whatever your hand and your plan had predestined

831
00:53:58.065 --> 00:54:02.975
to take place that paints a picture of Jesus' death

832
00:54:03.945 --> 00:54:07.605
being at the hand and plan of God.

833
00:54:10.865 --> 00:54:14.925
Our daily planning is also humbly

834
00:54:15.475 --> 00:54:16.845
conditioned by his will.

835
00:54:17.415 --> 00:54:20.045
James four 15. I love this verse.

836
00:54:22.725 --> 00:54:25.385
The passage is talking about all these plans that we want

837
00:54:25.385 --> 00:54:28.665
to make, want to go and do and accomplish and achieve.

838
00:54:29.485 --> 00:54:32.105
And it says in James four 15 it says, instead you ought

839
00:54:32.105 --> 00:54:36.855
to say, if the Lord wills, we will live

840
00:54:37.715 --> 00:54:38.975
and do this or that.

841
00:54:41.835 --> 00:54:45.655
And notice the phrase, we will live

842
00:54:47.945 --> 00:54:50.565
our living and even our breathing

843
00:54:51.515 --> 00:54:53.205
hang on his will.

844
00:54:57.275 --> 00:54:58.485
When we talk about God's will,

845
00:54:58.485 --> 00:55:01.685
it's important this distinguish revealed will from secret

846
00:55:01.875 --> 00:55:05.405
will God's revealed will gives his commands

847
00:55:05.405 --> 00:55:06.565
and is to be obeyed.

848
00:55:07.035 --> 00:55:08.125
Your will be done.

849
00:55:09.585 --> 00:55:13.245
And God's secret will is his decree of what shall be often

850
00:55:14.195 --> 00:55:16.565
only after, after it occurs.

851
00:55:17.105 --> 00:55:21.565
And holding both of those together keeps us responsible

852
00:55:22.185 --> 00:55:24.405
in obedience while trusting in his sovereignty.

853
00:55:25.285 --> 00:55:28.925
I my everybody calls those two types

854
00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:30.045
of wills, different things.

855
00:55:30.225 --> 00:55:35.205
My favorite way of calling those wills are will of command

856
00:55:35.825 --> 00:55:36.925
and will of decree.

857
00:55:36.955 --> 00:55:38.525
It's a little bit more descriptive than me,

858
00:55:38.525 --> 00:55:39.685
it's easier for me to remember.

859
00:55:40.035 --> 00:55:42.525
Will of command is simple, it's like his will is

860
00:55:42.525 --> 00:55:44.485
that you're obedient to his command in scripture.

861
00:55:44.515 --> 00:55:48.285
What does he command? It will of decree is I have

862
00:55:48.995 --> 00:55:51.125
decreed this to be, I've declared this to be.

863
00:55:51.125 --> 00:55:52.605
And so therefore it happens.

864
00:55:54.185 --> 00:55:58.565
Isaiah 46 says, says I am God

865
00:55:58.625 --> 00:56:00.885
and there is no other I'm God.

866
00:56:00.885 --> 00:56:04.085
And there's none like me declaring

867
00:56:04.825 --> 00:56:05.925
the end from the beginning

868
00:56:06.065 --> 00:56:08.085
and from ancient times things not yet done.

869
00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:12.365
That is decreeing what is going to happen.

870
00:56:12.625 --> 00:56:14.645
And he is declared everything.

871
00:56:18.385 --> 00:56:20.895
God's freedom means that he does whatever he pleases

872
00:56:21.155 --> 00:56:24.125
and that is consistent with his holy character.

873
00:56:25.905 --> 00:56:30.685
Second, second attribute here under attributes

874
00:56:30.685 --> 00:56:32.725
of purpose, omnipotence am gonna pick it up.

875
00:56:32.725 --> 00:56:36.965
Sorry. God's omnipotence means that he can do all of this.

876
00:56:36.965 --> 00:56:40.165
Holy will scripture says, is anything too hard for the Lord?

877
00:56:40.545 --> 00:56:44.405
No, nothing is with God. All things is are possible.

878
00:56:44.835 --> 00:56:47.085
He's able to do far more than we can ask or think.

879
00:56:47.265 --> 00:56:49.525
And his sovereignty is his active rule.

880
00:56:49.665 --> 00:56:52.165
He works all things according to counsel.

881
00:56:52.165 --> 00:56:55.585
Counsel of his will and his power never

882
00:56:56.135 --> 00:56:58.625
contradicts his character, cannot lie,

883
00:56:58.625 --> 00:56:59.945
cannot be tempted by evil.

884
00:57:00.045 --> 00:57:01.225
He cannot deny himself.

885
00:57:01.605 --> 00:57:04.705
And this kind of power that he exemplifies is not

886
00:57:05.015 --> 00:57:08.225
what you would classify as an absurd power.

887
00:57:08.295 --> 00:57:11.265
It's not an unreasonable crazy power.

888
00:57:15.635 --> 00:57:17.135
So it's attributes of purpose.

889
00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:22.615
Things are not ra random God's wise, ordering of all things

890
00:57:22.715 --> 00:57:25.775
and his holy power secures his purposes.

891
00:57:26.755 --> 00:57:29.935
Our calling is to obey his revealed will

892
00:57:30.515 --> 00:57:35.055
to trust his secret, will to trust his decreed will,

893
00:57:37.795 --> 00:57:42.535
and then to participate in Christ's life and mission.

894
00:57:43.965 --> 00:57:45.575
I'll really go quickly through this David

895
00:57:46.165 --> 00:57:48.095
summary attributes, what time, what you want,

896
00:57:49.005 --> 00:57:50.215
summary attributes.

897
00:57:51.275 --> 00:57:54.175
And these gather up fullness of God perfections

898
00:57:54.925 --> 00:57:56.295
into a few descriptions here.

899
00:57:56.295 --> 00:57:57.495
The first is perfection.

900
00:57:58.115 --> 00:58:02.655
God completely, completely possesses all excellent

901
00:58:02.655 --> 00:58:05.895
qualities and lacks nothing desirable.

902
00:58:06.435 --> 00:58:09.415
He is fully perfect. Nothing is missing.

903
00:58:10.395 --> 00:58:13.855
We imitate this by pursuing maturity to be perfect.

904
00:58:16.245 --> 00:58:17.825
How daunting is that? To be perfect

905
00:58:18.325 --> 00:58:22.225
as your father is perfect means to strive for wholehearted

906
00:58:22.745 --> 00:58:24.385
holiness across all of life.

907
00:58:25.245 --> 00:58:27.345
Second summary attribute blessedness.

908
00:58:27.645 --> 00:58:30.865
God delights fully in himself

909
00:58:31.365 --> 00:58:33.985
and in all that reflects his character.

910
00:58:34.775 --> 00:58:36.305
He's not restless, not needy,

911
00:58:36.305 --> 00:58:38.185
he's perfectly happy in himself

912
00:58:38.185 --> 00:58:41.025
and his delight spilled over onto us.

913
00:58:45.615 --> 00:58:47.155
The third summary.

914
00:58:47.375 --> 00:58:51.155
At beauty we see that God

915
00:58:52.255 --> 00:58:55.555
is the sum of all desirable qualities.

916
00:58:55.555 --> 00:58:58.835
We see that in Psalm 27, 4.

917
00:59:00.295 --> 00:59:03.075
One thing have I asked of the Lord that will I seek

918
00:59:03.075 --> 00:59:06.555
after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord

919
00:59:07.535 --> 00:59:11.795
all the days in my life to gaze upon the beauty

920
00:59:12.135 --> 00:59:15.795
of the Lord and to inquire in his temple.

921
00:59:19.015 --> 00:59:22.565
Beauty is this positive side of perfect is not.

922
00:59:22.635 --> 00:59:25.165
It's not just lacking nothing,

923
00:59:25.865 --> 00:59:28.965
but it's possessing everything that is desirable.

924
00:59:29.785 --> 00:59:33.005
And so we imitate this by loving the beauty of holiness.

925
00:59:34.635 --> 00:59:37.645
When we behold his beauty, scripture talks about this,

926
00:59:37.865 --> 00:59:41.445
we are changed or changed.

927
00:59:42.585 --> 00:59:47.485
So to summarize the summary attributes, God is the fullness

928
00:59:47.545 --> 00:59:48.605
of all excellence.

929
00:59:48.605 --> 00:59:51.395
Perfect, blessed, beautiful.

930
00:59:53.475 --> 00:59:58.215
So to conclude here, what have we seen?

931
00:59:58.645 --> 01:00:03.175
What do we know? God's communicable attributes are not

932
01:00:03.615 --> 01:00:07.695
abstract ideas, but rather they are His

933
01:00:07.765 --> 01:00:09.135
character revealed.

934
01:00:10.765 --> 01:00:13.185
He is admirable

935
01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:17.905
and he is imitable, admirable and imitable.

936
01:00:20.365 --> 01:00:21.505
We have a memory verse today

937
01:00:21.505 --> 01:00:22.625
and it's one we've already covered,

938
01:00:24.445 --> 01:00:27.295
but I want you now to see

939
01:00:27.555 --> 01:00:32.295
and appreciate these words as we, as I read through them.

940
01:00:32.955 --> 01:00:36.535
And I want you to identify your heart, your mind,

941
01:00:36.865 --> 01:00:40.215
those communicable attributes as I go through this.

942
01:00:42.315 --> 01:00:44.975
Exodus 34, 6, 7.

943
01:00:45.235 --> 01:00:46.615
The Lord passed before him

944
01:00:47.675 --> 01:00:52.335
and proclaimed the Lord, the Lord a God, merciful

945
01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:56.655
and gracious, slow to anger,

946
01:00:57.735 --> 01:00:59.345
abounding in steadfast love

947
01:00:59.345 --> 01:01:02.945
and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands,

948
01:01:03.575 --> 01:01:06.785
forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.

949
01:01:07.565 --> 01:01:10.905
But who will by no means clear the guilty.

950
01:01:12.645 --> 01:01:14.625
How does this point to Christ Jesus?

951
01:01:14.845 --> 01:01:18.105
We hold the glory of God, we behold it.

952
01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:22.025
It's full of grace and truth. Echoing love and faithfulness.

953
01:01:24.085 --> 01:01:25.455
John one 14 says this,

954
01:01:25.475 --> 01:01:27.535
and the word became flesh wealth among us.

955
01:01:27.755 --> 01:01:29.175
And we have seen His glory.

956
01:01:29.425 --> 01:01:33.255
Glory as of the only son from the Father full

957
01:01:33.395 --> 01:01:35.415
of grace and truth.

958
01:01:37.155 --> 01:01:41.175
So we imitate this by pursuing all of these

959
01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.815
we're merciful, gracious, we're patient,

960
01:01:44.185 --> 01:01:47.255
we're steadfast in love, we're truthful, we're forgiving.

961
01:01:47.305 --> 01:01:51.575
We're just, we don't compromise righteousness.

962
01:01:53.435 --> 01:01:57.935
My final word for you to carry as you

963
01:01:58.595 --> 01:02:02.855
go home tonight, when we behold

964
01:02:03.865 --> 01:02:05.335
God's communicable attributes,

965
01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:10.975
We see not only what he is like,

966
01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:15.215
but also what we're called to become.

967
01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:21.605
Let's pray. Father, we thank you

968
01:02:22.355 --> 01:02:25.845
that you have shown us your glory in your word

969
01:02:26.025 --> 01:02:29.885
and in Christ we confess we are slow to believe.

970
01:02:29.895 --> 01:02:30.965
We're quick to wander.

971
01:02:32.995 --> 01:02:37.765
Your mercy is tender and it is greater than our weakness.

972
01:02:37.835 --> 01:02:40.125
Your love is steadfast.

973
01:02:41.515 --> 01:02:46.045
Help us to walk in holiness, to speak truth,

974
01:02:47.225 --> 01:02:50.965
to show mercy to live in love,

975
01:02:52.385 --> 01:02:56.445
to teach us to trust your will, lean on your power

976
01:02:57.625 --> 01:03:02.245
and to rest in your blessedness and your beauty.

977
01:03:04.235 --> 01:03:08.245
Help us as we reflect your glory. In Jesus name pray. Amen.

978
01:03:08.555 --> 01:03:08.845
Amen.

979
01:03:19.515 --> 01:03:22.805
Alright, so here's the participation part of it.

980
01:03:22.805 --> 01:03:26.365
Everybody's got participation. So here we go.

981
01:03:26.795 --> 01:03:31.245
What we have is everybody remember Muhammad Ali?

982
01:03:31.665 --> 01:03:34.245
No. Champion me there.

983
01:03:35.265 --> 01:03:38.965
Say one time he was getting on an airplane fixing the head

984
01:03:38.985 --> 01:03:42.725
out to another fight and uh, the steer just comes by

985
01:03:42.725 --> 01:03:46.565
and said, sir, please open your buckle on.

986
01:03:46.565 --> 01:03:49.525
Buckle up your seatbelt. Okay.

987
01:03:49.705 --> 01:03:53.965
He says, ah, Superman don't need no no be

988
01:03:55.435 --> 01:03:57.405
Yeah, but Superman don't need no flame.

989
01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.805
She says. So here we go.

990
01:03:59.985 --> 01:04:02.085
You might go at all, you might be holding more

991
01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:05.165
hot dogs up than in rest of us for a buckle up.

992
01:04:05.225 --> 01:04:07.925
Get to the game and participate. I want you to talk out.

993
01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:11.405
I do have a rhetorical question for you first,

994
01:04:11.585 --> 01:04:14.605
but first I'm gonna call on my three Paul brothers.

995
01:04:15.265 --> 01:04:18.045
So I need you to look up, uh, captain Paul,

996
01:04:18.225 --> 01:04:23.085
please look up Romans 9 21, uh, piano Paul

997
01:04:24.155 --> 01:04:29.085
from Joshua 24 15 and two dogs St.

998
01:04:29.285 --> 01:04:30.845
Corinthians five 20.

999
01:04:31.995 --> 01:04:34.925
Your reportal question is,

1000
01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:37.925
how is God like us?

1001
01:04:39.185 --> 01:04:40.045
If he's invisible.

1002
01:04:44.245 --> 01:04:45.725
I know right now he's invisible

1003
01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:48.485
'cause he's made everything I was going talk about tonight

1004
01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:49.685
invisible in my head.

1005
01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:52.965
I can't see. Alright, so here we go.

1006
01:04:53.335 --> 01:04:55.045
We're gonna talk about invisibility.

1007
01:04:57.465 --> 01:05:00.685
How in the world does that relate to us? Let's see.

1008
01:05:00.685 --> 01:05:03.125
What Gruden has states says God's total essence,

1009
01:05:03.785 --> 01:05:07.845
all his spiritual being can never be seen by us.

1010
01:05:09.665 --> 01:05:13.325
Yet God still shows himself to us through visible

1011
01:05:14.105 --> 01:05:15.525
and created things.

1012
01:05:17.995 --> 01:05:20.445
It's invisible, but we can see him through those things.

1013
01:05:21.055 --> 01:05:24.605
God's invisibility means God himself decides

1014
01:05:24.605 --> 01:05:28.085
to whom he's gonna reveal himself from.

1015
01:05:28.085 --> 01:05:29.965
Matthew 1127.

1016
01:05:30.655 --> 01:05:33.885
God's invisibility means that we must daily,

1017
01:05:34.675 --> 01:05:37.845
intentionally seek after fellowship with him

1018
01:05:38.585 --> 01:05:40.445
and not take it for granted.

1019
01:05:41.045 --> 01:05:43.005
Jeremiah 29 13.

1020
01:05:48.585 --> 01:05:53.325
So the human beings, we as human beings, we're both a

1021
01:05:54.285 --> 01:05:56.885
creature and a person.

1022
01:05:56.915 --> 01:06:00.075
Correct? So

1023
01:06:00.735 --> 01:06:04.715
to be a creature means to completely

1024
01:06:05.825 --> 01:06:07.915
depending on God.

1025
01:06:08.095 --> 01:06:09.595
We completely depend on him.

1026
01:06:10.735 --> 01:06:13.795
All creatures do correct, but we're a person.

1027
01:06:15.135 --> 01:06:17.155
And give us a definition of that.

1028
01:06:17.165 --> 01:06:19.235
Being a person means we're related.

1029
01:06:20.395 --> 01:06:24.555
Independence or our ability to choose. We have a choice.

1030
01:06:24.695 --> 01:06:25.995
We can choose things, right?

1031
01:06:27.015 --> 01:06:29.475
He gave us a a ability to reason.

1032
01:06:33.325 --> 01:06:36.465
Self-determination. So here's the mystery we have.

1033
01:06:38.525 --> 01:06:42.145
How can you, whether a guy or girl, can you be a creature

1034
01:06:42.445 --> 01:06:45.185
and a person, someone who's totally dependent on God,

1035
01:06:45.645 --> 01:06:50.465
but somebody, a person who gets to make decisions.

1036
01:06:59.965 --> 01:07:02.465
God will. God will. Okay.

1037
01:07:12.765 --> 01:07:14.625
How, what does that look like from the Bible?

1038
01:07:14.845 --> 01:07:17.545
Can anybody tell me what, how do we see that in the Bible?

1039
01:07:19.815 --> 01:07:22.225
Genesis Okay. Being

1040
01:07:22.225 --> 01:07:24.745
Made from the earth, the, the, the dust of the earth.

1041
01:07:25.215 --> 01:07:29.265
Okay, so good. Captain Paul, read your regards please.

1042
01:07:29.685 --> 01:07:33.385
Romans 9 21 has the potter no right over the clay

1043
01:07:33.645 --> 01:07:35.025
to make out of the same month.

1044
01:07:35.205 --> 01:07:39.105
One best for honorable use and another for dishonorable use.

1045
01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:42.465
God it a dish honor, we are a creature

1046
01:07:42.685 --> 01:07:43.825
who made this correct.

1047
01:07:45.295 --> 01:07:49.985
Okay, now, uh, piano, Paul Joshua 24 15.

1048
01:07:51.355 --> 01:07:54.695
And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose

1049
01:07:54.715 --> 01:07:56.135
to stay who you'll serve.

1050
01:07:56.365 --> 01:07:59.095
Whether the gods of the Father served in a region

1051
01:07:59.155 --> 01:08:01.895
beyond the river or the gods of the Amorites

1052
01:08:02.715 --> 01:08:04.215
in whose land you dwell.

1053
01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:07.495
But as for me in my house, we'll serve the Lord

1054
01:08:09.035 --> 01:08:10.035
God. We have a choice

1055
01:08:10.035 --> 01:08:11.255
to serve God

1056
01:08:11.835 --> 01:08:14.975
or not to serve God as you person, as a creature.

1057
01:08:15.665 --> 01:08:20.565
You remain by God. You determin tell. Alright? Uh, two dogs.

1058
01:08:21.915 --> 01:08:26.445
Therefore we are ambassadors of Christ, God making his

1059
01:08:26.785 --> 01:08:29.365
for us and implore you on behalf Christ

1060
01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:30.885
and reconcile for God.

1061
01:08:32.035 --> 01:08:33.765
Corinthians by.

1062
01:08:35.225 --> 01:08:38.925
So we're creatures but we're made to do his work.

1063
01:08:39.225 --> 01:08:41.965
He wants us to work hard to glorify him. Correct?

1064
01:08:42.675 --> 01:08:44.365
Okay, so here's our second one.

1065
01:08:44.935 --> 01:08:49.285
Since you are a creature, you can only be saved by grace.

1066
01:08:50.515 --> 01:08:53.605
That is complete dependence on

1067
01:08:53.825 --> 01:08:55.805
God, on God's mercy.

1068
01:08:55.855 --> 01:09:00.205
Right? Have the fact that you are also a person means

1069
01:09:00.205 --> 01:09:02.765
that you have an essential role to play

1070
01:09:03.825 --> 01:09:05.645
in the process of redemption.

1071
01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:09.525
Very responsibility in the process of salvation.

1072
01:09:10.195 --> 01:09:14.125
What is your role in the process of salvation?

1073
01:09:15.475 --> 01:09:19.605
Succeed it. Receive it.

1074
01:09:19.715 --> 01:09:21.965
What, what, what, what, what does that entail?

1075
01:09:26.915 --> 01:09:30.445
Okay. Is there a part in there where, uh,

1076
01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:31.965
that's half of it, right?

1077
01:09:32.825 --> 01:09:35.965
What's the other half? Repentance. Repentance. Perfect.

1078
01:09:36.865 --> 01:09:38.725
You must choose the empowered

1079
01:09:38.865 --> 01:09:43.405
and be empowered by the Holy Spirit to repent of sin

1080
01:09:43.585 --> 01:09:45.645
and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.

1081
01:09:48.425 --> 01:09:51.285
But mouth Jesus.

1082
01:09:53.315 --> 01:09:58.165
Believe in your heart you'll be saved.

1083
01:10:00.185 --> 01:10:02.485
And belief. And what's

1084
01:10:06.225 --> 01:10:09.125
that's we go look at people, be baptized,

1085
01:10:09.465 --> 01:10:10.805
be the profession of it.

1086
01:10:10.995 --> 01:10:14.725
Correct. So another question now, more of application.

1087
01:10:15.105 --> 01:10:18.805
How do you pursue fellowship with God instead?

1088
01:10:19.035 --> 01:10:21.565
Because we talked about fellowship back up here, right?

1089
01:10:21.565 --> 01:10:25.285
Where God's in disability means that we must daily,

1090
01:10:26.005 --> 01:10:29.335
intentionally seek after fellowship with you

1091
01:10:29.955 --> 01:10:31.495
and not take it for granted.

1092
01:10:34.095 --> 01:10:36.495
'cause he is invisible. We need to seek that fellowship.

1093
01:10:36.675 --> 01:10:39.335
How are you doing that? Can somebody gimme an example?

1094
01:10:39.675 --> 01:10:40.375
You personally?

1095
01:10:45.525 --> 01:10:47.615
Good. Anyone else?

1096
01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:53.535
Reflecting God's glory. Good. And doing how you do that?

1097
01:10:55.355 --> 01:10:58.855
By loving is he loves caring as he cares. Forgives us.

1098
01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:00.975
He forgives good. Yeah.

1099
01:11:01.035 --> 01:11:04.055
In the way you do relationship with others. Very good.

1100
01:11:04.595 --> 01:11:09.255
Anyone else reading a word but then chewing on it? Good.

1101
01:11:10.645 --> 01:11:14.605
Good. Actually reasoning and thought process that he gave.

1102
01:11:14.785 --> 01:11:16.245
Set up. There we go.

1103
01:11:16.555 --> 01:11:19.165
Alright, I have one more question just

1104
01:11:19.185 --> 01:11:20.285
off the top of my head.

1105
01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:22.325
I don't have permission for my elders,

1106
01:11:22.325 --> 01:11:24.205
so it's not his fault all on me.

1107
01:11:24.235 --> 01:11:27.085
Okay. So if you hear someone say

1108
01:11:28.965 --> 01:11:31.245
everyone's a child of God, is that correct?

1109
01:11:31.945 --> 01:11:32.165
No.

1110
01:11:38.505 --> 01:11:42.545
Creature created God. Very good. Very good.

1111
01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:43.905
So we're all creatures.

1112
01:11:43.905 --> 01:11:46.105
We're all created in the image of God,

1113
01:11:46.765 --> 01:11:50.305
but we're not all children of God

1114
01:11:51.035 --> 01:11:53.025
until we accept Christ in their heart.

1115
01:11:53.515 --> 01:11:57.585
Right? Adopted. Very good. Thank you guys.

1116
01:11:58.075 --> 01:12:00.025
Thank you David. Appreciate you.

1117
01:12:04.005 --> 01:12:07.385
Uh, what do you wanna do? Paul? Just go or, uh, I think so.

1118
01:12:07.695 --> 01:12:12.225
Yeah. Another hall I just renamed you Paul. Thank y'all.

1119
01:12:12.485 --> 01:12:16.665
Thanks guys. Have a good one. So we're set. We're all good.

1120
01:12:16.675 --> 01:12:20.145
We're sent, we're good to go. We are sent, we are sent.

1121
01:12:20.465 --> 01:12:22.865
I, woo. I got for you. Okay.
