1
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.380
This is two weeks ago that I didn't get to do last week.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.420
So we're gonna hit this one real quick and then we'll hit this past week.

3
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.860
Let's skip ahead to where we actually start service.

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.873
That's,

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.300
I think we're coming out to a welcome maybe.

6
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.740
Nope. Good morning, Henderson. I,

7
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.180
this is the day that the Lord has made. Let's stand to our feet.

8
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.140
We're gonna sing songs together.

9
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.523
Let

10
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.710
That shot moved with the guitar. It was good. It had good movements.

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.270
Intentional. That was good.

12
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.503
Let

13
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.463
Yes,

14
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.290
We'll see you breakdown. Giant.

15
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.570
Nice. It's good found. It's a little jittery, but it, uh,

16
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.250
it's opening up the right way.

17
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.410
It's a good shot. It's very obvious who we're focusing on.

18
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.290
We're not trying to frame people in the background. That's good.

19
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.450
I think it's important that we say this too. Um,

20
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.490
her auto-tune is what's messing up here. She's actually singing the right notes,

21
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.650
but the auto tune's in the wrong key. That's why it sounds weird right now.

22
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.483
If you're wondering

23
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.913
it's a good follow.

24
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.820
Skip ahead a bit to a transition.

25
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.980
Remember,

26
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.380
just be aware whenever your camera's being taken and then as a director,

27
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.300
just make sure you're communicating y'all doing this morning, um,

28
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.900
when you are taking a, uh,

29
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.540
camera shot so that your camera hops no, to not move

30
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.140
or adjust, I should say. Movement is good. Um,

31
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.980
but you don't wanna adjust while you're here.

32
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.780
700 kids. That

33
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.020
Is amazing. That's a good transition though.

34
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.140
So this next week we'll have kids in here. They'll be laughing. They

35
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.980
We're gonna transition back into worship. We'll

36
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.100
Worship through giving and worship through song.

37
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.843
Amen.

38
00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.060
We've been taught church that if we do not praise the rocks are

39
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.420
gonna cry out. So we're gonna sing this part right here. I'm gonna start it

40
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.500
Off. All right. So here, um, to learn.

41
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.560
Okay?

42
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.700
We want, we're gonna praise him. And you wanna, so if we're on taught

43
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.320
Church, that if

44
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.120
We, um,

45
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.780
We want to invite all of you to

46
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.580
Come, this is one or two a great chance for, or the other. You see

47
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.860
What the kids have been learning for the week, the one at the middle iss,

48
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.700
and just pass that on.

49
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.940
We've been taught church that if we,

50
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.100
We will worship through giving and worship

51
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.540
Through all. So let's say this is one. I don't know if it is.

52
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.420
And then we're cutting to two here. Maybe the top, maybe, um,

53
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.540
let two be a wide shot. Uh,

54
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.540
cuz this long kind of wiggly zoom is a little bit like unsettling as you're

55
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.900
watching it. Um, so yeah,

56
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.780
let two be a wide shot and we can see what's going on while one

57
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.580
is focusing back. So one was on Katina and then we catch two, which was wide.

58
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.180
Keep it wide and then let one refocus on, uh,

59
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.260
whoever's gonna sing the next song. That,

60
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.620
and then the rocks are gonna that way we're not doing this long, so we're

61
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.900
Gonna sing this part right here. Yeah, I'm gonna start it off.

62
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.220
Very easy to learn. Okay? And we're gonna praise him.

63
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.300
If you wanna praise him through singing, that's great.

64
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.140
You wanna praise him through clapping, you know,

65
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.220
you are welcome to praise him any way that you feel. All right.

66
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.260
So I'm gonna sing it first and you go into it. Just let it all out. Let's pray.

67
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.100
Don't be like the rock. Let's pray. Right?

68
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.930
I can't

69
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:36.763
Hold back

70
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.740
My praise. I gotta let it out. I

71
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.580
Can't hold back my

72
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.140
Praise. I gotta let, I can't

73
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.140
Singing. Denise,

74
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.740
Praise. Yes. I can't

75
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.540
back. Yes. I gotta again,

76
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.540
To praise you.

77
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.740
What, what, what,

78
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.260
what earth was happening there?

79
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.620
What app? Praise you.

80
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.300
So I don't know what was happening here. Um,

81
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.360
but remember if you're, uh, running the program bus, um,

82
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.600
which is all you should be switching on the side screens.

83
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.520
They stay pro two the whole time.

84
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.560
And then all you're doing is switching the program bus.

85
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.440
If you're on the program bus in a situation like that,

86
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.960
you're just fading to black. And then whoever is,

87
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.960
um, running graphics is just clicking on the bumper video.

88
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.160
And so we won't,

89
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.640
all we'll see is camera fade to black and then that bumper video's just gonna

90
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.880
key up over top of it. So,

91
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.120
um, yeah, I don't exactly know what happened here.

92
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.040
It's a phrase. Yeah, that's the way it should be done.

93
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.480
So, um,

94
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.680
it looks like we went back and forth between a couple things there.

95
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.473
I will not.

96
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.400
Good morning church. My name's Phil Sali. Yeah, some of

97
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.720
You said good morning. Once again, it's, it's okay to do keep the,

98
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.040
keep the wide shot wide and the close shot close. Um,

99
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.280
but we don't wanna zoom this far, uh, every time it's a new,

100
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.960
a new shot. I can almost give you the feeling of impending doom.

101
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.200
Actually, mom's not here, but whoever that was, thank you. Um,

102
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.440
I'm the pastor of discipleship and Community. If you're a visitor here, I'm, uh,

103
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.800
I'm just kinda like a sub.

104
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.560
These are all good transitions. Um, so little things that we can work on

105
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.360
In prayer that he'll continue to come back and, uh, rested and,

106
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.320
and revitalized and and fulfilling the mandate of his calling. Amen. And so,

107
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:33.940
uh,

108
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.080
I'm trying to find a side shot. There we go.

109
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.080
Control our children seem to be leading

110
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.800
To the church. Okay, so here coming, uh, once again,

111
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.400
you wanna make sure that when you're cutting from front

112
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.373
to side,

113
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.800
Financially we're afraid geopolitically

114
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.090
Watch this

115
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.340
Potential war scenarios. We're afraid of

116
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.780
Things we can't control. Mm-hmm. Did I miss it or was it back? There we go.

117
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.740
Okay. So, um,

118
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.580
here we're cutting but we're also on the same

119
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.940
framing. We're afraid of from here

120
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.253
Scenarios,

121
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.260
we're afraid of things we can't control and our children seem to be leaving

122
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.380
To there and he's almost in the same exact spot. Um,

123
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.860
so things you want to keep in mind,

124
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.700
if you're going from a straight on shot to a side shot,

125
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.100
it's best to switch framing.

126
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.300
So if you're at a what knees up

127
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.860
on your front shot, uh,

128
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.500
mid waist I guess, or mid, uh, mid thigh. Um,

129
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.820
when you go to your side shot,

130
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.180
You would want to do like an elbows up.

131
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.340
You want to go close or my preference would be a head

132
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.820
to toe. Um,

133
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.380
and then place the subject just slightly in a different,

134
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.980
so like, we're coming from camera three now. So he's always, I mean,

135
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.860
typically 99% of the time from camera three they're gonna be facing this way

136
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.020
cuz we're at that, uh, house left angle. Um,

137
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.380
and they're usually looking straight out.

138
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.740
So they're pretty much always gonna be looking here.

139
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.380
And so it'll be natural for us to put them over here

140
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.180
in this left third. Cause remember we're splitting into thirds.

141
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.580
Those are your two third lines.

142
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.540
So his body and head are gonna be in this line right here.

143
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.340
And then the podium is like here, or in his case music stand.

144
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.380
Um, and that keeps the weight right cuz he's looking this way,

145
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.660
which gives us weight in the direction he's looking. Um,

146
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.420
and then it, when we have switched to a head to toe as well,

147
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.700
then it's gonna feel more natural than just like, uh,

148
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.300
it almost feels like your head has like it's a, uh,

149
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.140
twitch in your vision as opposed to a new camera angle. Um,

150
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.540
cuz they're so similar.

151
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.580
So you want to give them some clearly defined differences. Uh,

152
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.420
when you do that switch

153
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.180
Church, instead of coming to the church,

154
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.460
we know how to get them back and we do everything we can to make

155
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.593
All ending.

156
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.180
Let's stand together and worship him

157
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.820
And then don't follow, don't follow him.

158
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.460
We don't need to know where he's going.

159
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.260
So I'd just go to a wide shot and then have whoever was on one get on

160
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.860
whoever's singing the next song,

161
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.580
which in this case was not that one.

162
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.660
That was probably me that called that problem because I've been struggling on

163
00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.500
remembering his singing songs, even those written down in front of me.

164
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.820
Those are good shots. Let's see why

165
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:34.780
That's

166
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.460
Good. Um, you know, if, if we nitpick you could,

167
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.260
uh, put them just slightly higher so that they're in that,

168
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.540
that middle third. Remember we split it thirds both ways.

169
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.260
And then, um, as you zoom out, add to the bottom,

170
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.020
not the top. Cuz we really don't wanna see the screens if possible. Um,

171
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.620
it's not the end of the world, but I'd prefer not to.

172
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.090
Looking

173
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.020
Very purple. Jason

174
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.260
Focus is a little off on this one, but

175
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.500
probably camera issue more than anything else.

176
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.483
That was good too.

177
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.980
So probably started a little too far out

178
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.580
and it's gone way too long.

179
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.180
And what a gift. God's grace that we can come together.

180
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.300
Like this is his body too

181
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.380
On this one. Just keep that,

182
00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:55.940
keep that headroom kind of similar and then open up on the lower portion as

183
00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.100
opposed to, like I said,

184
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.300
that's just nit biggie. It's not, um,

185
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.700
Not the end of the one. Shame on the,

186
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.260
and our assurance is this. No,

187
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.073
no power

188
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.700
Check the focus on this one. Something's going on with that camera.

189
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.580
That was just, just way too long. It's all, it was a good pull. Um,

190
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.500
and it was a good shot. I like how it starts here. Um,

191
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.100
but it should cut now.

192
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.540
It just goes on way too long. Um,

193
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:07.020
odds are you're probably gonna keep the camera shot up longer than you think.

194
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.260
So err on the side of switching more

195
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.140
and then dial it back if you need to. Um,

196
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.780
obviously in slower parts of the song you're gonna slow down, you're switching,

197
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.700
you're not gonna be going crazy. But let it be dynamic with the song as well.

198
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.043
It's a good shot.

199
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:40.780
Let's see that one again.

200
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:55.540
Yeah, so one thing to look for with your pulls and pushes is all of them.

201
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.300
Probably anything that's not camera one right now when it pulls

202
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.260
you're getting this wiggle. You see that wiggle in there.

203
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.260
We're also opening up an overhead. We wanna keep them in that center third.

204
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:19.110
Um, but yeah, we're seeing that wiggle as we're zooming out. Uh,

205
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.510
so either keep it steady or only do it on the camera. Uh,

206
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.790
they currently can, which is

207
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.600
Morning church. My name's Josh Del.

208
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.960
I'm at Deacon here at Henderson Hills and a community group leader.

209
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.560
And I've got boon wise with me this morning.

210
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.260
And remember it's okay to sit on a wide shot.

211
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.100
We don't have to slowly zoom up while the other camera's get in.

212
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.700
This one we can sit on that wide shot.

213
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.340
I'd rather do that than slowly zoom up into, uh, my name.

214
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.460
Ison Wise. I'm 11 years old.

215
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.180
You know what's funny is from on Sunday all I could see was this from where I

216
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.900
was sitting his shoulder of my life. So I didn't even know she was up there and

217
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:13.020
Changed so much over the last year because of God and what he has done in my

218
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:13.853
life.

219
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.063
Isn't God good?

220
00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.220
It's a good shot. Well framed his

221
00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.500
Faithfulness and his goodness, our only response.

222
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.420
Cool. Good work team. Um,

223
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.060
we're making small improvements every week and it's showing, it's looking good.

224
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.740
See y'all next time.
