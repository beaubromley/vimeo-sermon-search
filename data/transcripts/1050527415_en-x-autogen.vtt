1
00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:19.525
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:20.925
It is great to see you.

3
00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:23.405
Uh, I love seeing new faces every week.

4
00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:25.285
I love seeing familiar faces every week,

5
00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:26.725
so it's a joy to be back.

6
00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:29.805
If you weren't here last week, I was out, uh, last week.

7
00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.125
I was away with our oldest son.

8
00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:33.485
He was involved in a training camp,

9
00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:36.245
and so he was busy on Sunday morning.

10
00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:38.245
And so where we were, I just went ahead

11
00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:39.685
and went to church by myself

12
00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:42.525
and found a Gospel Center church and attended that.

13
00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:44.285
And I'm grateful, first of all,

14
00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:46.805
that the same good news we preach is going forth

15
00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:47.965
there as well.

16
00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:50.805
It's, uh, amazing what God does through all kinds

17
00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:53.725
of different styles and iterations of churches,

18
00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:55.765
but it also gave me a glimpse into something.

19
00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:00.565
I, I haven't had to do this very much in my life, but,

20
00:01:00.565 --> 00:01:02.325
but even I as a pastor

21
00:01:03.865 --> 00:01:05.925
was a bit intimidated walking into a

22
00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:07.005
place I'd never been before.

23
00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:09.805
I don't know anybody, like no

24
00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:11.605
connection, just walking in there.

25
00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:13.805
I felt that as I was walking across the parking lot, felt

26
00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:16.325
that twinge in my stomach a little bit as a pastor.

27
00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:18.485
Like, I'm just going to church with brothers.

28
00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:19.725
Like, but it felt it, right?

29
00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.525
And so let me just talk to you if you're new.

30
00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:24.445
Uh, if, if you are new here, we see you.

31
00:01:24.475 --> 00:01:26.485
Like we, we know you're here.

32
00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:29.445
And we know it's not a minor thing

33
00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:32.325
that you would show up somewhere new for the first time.

34
00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.125
And so we just wanna say welcome

35
00:01:34.305 --> 00:01:35.485
and thank you for doing that.

36
00:01:36.065 --> 00:01:37.885
Uh, and maybe it doesn't stick right away,

37
00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:39.045
like it takes a moment.

38
00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:40.925
But just keep pressing in, please.

39
00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:42.125
Like, let us help you do that.

40
00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:43.925
We want to try to be as welcoming as we can,

41
00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:46.245
but we know it's a big deal to do that.

42
00:01:46.345 --> 00:01:49.005
And so just help us, help you as best we can.

43
00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:52.685
Uh, but also, if you call Henderson Hills home,

44
00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:57.965
make it a priority to find somebody who's new and,

45
00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:01.205
and pull them into the life of the church with you.

46
00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:06.045
Okay? It's not easy to do, but let's do it as we go.

47
00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.485
So I'm grateful for that experience. Help me understand.

48
00:02:08.485 --> 00:02:10.005
But I'm also really grateful

49
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:11.325
that I get to be a part of this church.

50
00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.965
So super thankful to be back and love doing this with you.

51
00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:16.605
Let's now open God's word together.

52
00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:18.725
Turning back to one Samuel.

53
00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.645
We'll be in chapter 21, Samuel Chapter 20.

54
00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:24.125
That's where we'll be today.

55
00:02:26.935 --> 00:02:28.725
We've already seen David's been anointed

56
00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:32.005
as the replacement king for Israel.

57
00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:36.365
God chose him while Saul, the one who's being replaced.

58
00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:39.445
He is now openly persecuting David.

59
00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:42.485
He's, he's against God's plan.

60
00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:45.525
He's actually trying to kill David.

61
00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:47.365
He's scared to lose his own position.

62
00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:50.085
And so going after David in all of these ways,

63
00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:51.885
and we'll see it, the rest of the book actually,

64
00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:53.165
David's on the run.

65
00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:56.725
He has to just flee for his life.

66
00:02:56.945 --> 00:03:00.445
Yet, chapter 20 today takes a bit of a deviation

67
00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:03.845
and actually focuses more on Jonathan Saul's son,

68
00:03:05.865 --> 00:03:10.325
how he reacted to his father seeking to kill David's life,

69
00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:13.165
this anointed man, how he, he's seeking to take it away.

70
00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:15.645
And what this is gonna show us,

71
00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:19.205
what it will reveal is the cost of faithfulness,

72
00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:25.085
how painful it can be to choose to be faithful to God.

73
00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:27.125
And, and sometimes that costs us things.

74
00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:29.405
And so follow along with me.

75
00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:32.685
I'm gonna read verses one through 17 to set the context

76
00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:37.335
of the chapter, to dial dialogue

77
00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:39.215
between these brother like friends,

78
00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:41.535
Saul's son, Jonathan and David.

79
00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:44.575
Jonathan and David are dialoguing. Here's how it goes.

80
00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:50.295
Then David fled from Neau in Ramah and came and said,

81
00:03:50.295 --> 00:03:52.615
before Jonathan, what have I done?

82
00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:54.655
What's my guilt? What is my sin

83
00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:56.615
before your father that he seeks my life?

84
00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:00.815
And Jonathan said to him, far from it, you shall not die.

85
00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:03.255
Behold, my father does nothing either great

86
00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:04.855
or small, without disclosing it to me.

87
00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:07.815
And why? Why should my father hide this from me?

88
00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:10.855
It's not so. But David vowed again,

89
00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.095
say, no, your father knows.

90
00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:14.015
Well, I found favor in your eyes.

91
00:04:14.075 --> 00:04:15.935
And he thinks, well, don't let Jonathan know

92
00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:17.495
lest he be grieved.

93
00:04:18.395 --> 00:04:21.135
But truly as the Lord lives, as your soul lives, there is

94
00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:22.855
but a step between me and death.

95
00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:25.925
And then Jonathan said to David, okay,

96
00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:27.085
whatever you say I'll do for you.

97
00:04:27.665 --> 00:04:29.685
And so David said to Jonathan, behold,

98
00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:31.005
tomorrow is the new moon.

99
00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:34.045
I should not fail to sit at table to eat a feast

100
00:04:34.045 --> 00:04:36.405
with the king, but let me go

101
00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:38.485
that I may hide myself in the field till the

102
00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:39.525
third day at evening.

103
00:04:39.785 --> 00:04:42.605
And if your father misses me at all, then say, well,

104
00:04:42.605 --> 00:04:46.405
David earnestly asked leave to run to Bethlehem, his city.

105
00:04:46.405 --> 00:04:49.085
There's a yearly sacrifice there for his family.

106
00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:53.245
And if he says, good, it will be well with your servant,

107
00:04:53.245 --> 00:04:54.445
meaning, I'm okay.

108
00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:58.485
But if he's angry, then know that harm is determined by him.

109
00:04:59.275 --> 00:05:01.005
Therefore, Joe, kindly with your servant,

110
00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:03.085
for you've brought your servant into a covenant

111
00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:04.125
of the Lord with you.

112
00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:06.525
But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself

113
00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:08.965
for why should you bring me to your father?

114
00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:11.845
And Jonathan said, far be it from you.

115
00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:13.805
If I knew that it was determined by my father,

116
00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:14.965
that harm should come to you.

117
00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:18.915
Would I not tell you? And David said, Jonathan, okay,

118
00:05:18.915 --> 00:05:20.595
who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?

119
00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:23.155
And Jonathan said to David, well, I will.

120
00:05:23.175 --> 00:05:24.875
So come, let us go out into the field.

121
00:05:25.495 --> 00:05:26.875
So they both went out into the field

122
00:05:26.895 --> 00:05:30.515
and Jonathan said to David, the Lord, the God of Israel,

123
00:05:30.655 --> 00:05:33.635
be witness when I have sounded out,

124
00:05:33.635 --> 00:05:35.235
meaning I've figured out what he's doing.

125
00:05:35.295 --> 00:05:38.035
My Father about this time tomorrow or the third day.

126
00:05:38.095 --> 00:05:40.235
Behold, if he's well disposed toward David,

127
00:05:40.445 --> 00:05:42.395
shall I not then send and disclose it to you?

128
00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:47.285
But should it please my Father to do you harm the Lord?

129
00:05:47.385 --> 00:05:48.445
Do so to Jonathan.

130
00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:51.405
And more also, if I do not disclose it to you

131
00:05:51.425 --> 00:05:53.525
and send you away that you may go in safety.

132
00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:57.320
May the Lord be with you as he's been with my Father.

133
00:05:58.705 --> 00:06:01.965
If I'm still alive, show me the steadfast love of the Lord

134
00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:03.085
that I may not die

135
00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:06.725
and do not cut off your steadfast love from my house

136
00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:10.125
forever, when the Lord cuts off every one of the enemies

137
00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:11.405
of David from the face of the earth.

138
00:06:12.545 --> 00:06:15.405
And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David saying,

139
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.925
may the Lord take vengeance on David's enemies.

140
00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:21.885
And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him,

141
00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:24.645
for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

142
00:06:26.905 --> 00:06:30.005
So first we need to even figure out what's going on here.

143
00:06:30.315 --> 00:06:34.045
Okay? This is a little bit of a circular dialogue

144
00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:36.205
between the two, but what's even going on?

145
00:06:36.475 --> 00:06:39.685
What does the narrator highlight for us to focus on?

146
00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:42.435
Because it seems like Jonathan's unaware

147
00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:44.035
that Saul is intending to kill David.

148
00:06:45.055 --> 00:06:48.035
We as readers already know that David already knows that.

149
00:06:48.455 --> 00:06:51.915
But Jonathan seems like he's a little bit clueless

150
00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:56.275
that Saul had determined to kill David, at least initially.

151
00:06:57.035 --> 00:06:59.235
Jonathan doesn't know. Saul's trying to kill David.

152
00:07:00.815 --> 00:07:03.515
We know that already, multiple times in various ways.

153
00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:05.475
Saul has tried to eliminate David

154
00:07:07.205 --> 00:07:08.815
That this was Saul's direction.

155
00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:12.495
He was so jealous of God's selection of David.

156
00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:16.535
He was so fixated on keeping his power at whatever

157
00:07:16.605 --> 00:07:18.015
cost he needed to.

158
00:07:18.155 --> 00:07:21.135
He was willing to put the young hero David to death

159
00:07:21.565 --> 00:07:23.135
that everybody else saw as a hero.

160
00:07:23.395 --> 00:07:24.975
He was willing to take his life.

161
00:07:27.325 --> 00:07:29.865
And so Jonathan discovers, he's learning

162
00:07:30.255 --> 00:07:33.705
what David has said is going to happen, he believes.

163
00:07:34.645 --> 00:07:38.545
Yet remember, Jonathan also knew this covenant

164
00:07:38.775 --> 00:07:40.185
between David and God.

165
00:07:40.255 --> 00:07:43.145
This anointing from God set David apart.

166
00:07:43.165 --> 00:07:45.345
And so he was already knowing

167
00:07:45.345 --> 00:07:49.185
that David was gonna emerge victorious from the strife

168
00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:51.585
that he was facing, that he would eventually be the king

169
00:07:51.585 --> 00:07:53.625
because he had seen God's anointing on David.

170
00:07:54.545 --> 00:07:57.145
Jonathan was convinced. And

171
00:07:57.145 --> 00:08:00.545
so here in renewing the covenant, that's this whole chapter,

172
00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:02.625
Jonathan committed to protect David.

173
00:08:06.095 --> 00:08:07.795
He said, David, I'm committed to protect you.

174
00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:09.075
I'll tell you if something's going on,

175
00:08:09.105 --> 00:08:11.075
I'll tell you if you need to run all of that,

176
00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:16.155
I'm gonna use my authoritative position as the king's son

177
00:08:16.615 --> 00:08:20.995
to protect the vulnerable to shelter, the one at risk,

178
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:23.715
to tell David if he needs to run away

179
00:08:23.715 --> 00:08:24.715
or if he needs to do something else.

180
00:08:25.595 --> 00:08:27.315
Jonathan said, I'm, I'm here for you, man.

181
00:08:27.415 --> 00:08:31.405
I'm protecting you. And

182
00:08:31.405 --> 00:08:32.805
so look at David's response.

183
00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:34.085
How did David respond?

184
00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:36.445
He said, well, I'm gonna bless Jonathan.

185
00:08:37.565 --> 00:08:40.795
I promise to bless you as part

186
00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:42.915
of this relational covenant that they had together.

187
00:08:43.805 --> 00:08:46.835
David was going to bless Jonathan.

188
00:08:48.225 --> 00:08:51.075
Look again at verses 14 through 17 to see this.

189
00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:55.845
This is Jonathan saying, if I'm still alive,

190
00:08:56.475 --> 00:08:59.205
show me the steadfast love of the Lord that I may not die.

191
00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:02.525
Do not cut off your steadfast love from my house forever,

192
00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:05.045
when the Lord does cut off every one of the enemies

193
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.645
of David from the face of the earth.

194
00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:07.685
We'll come back to that in a second.

195
00:09:08.505 --> 00:09:10.605
And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David saying,

196
00:09:10.625 --> 00:09:12.605
may the Lord take vengeance on David's enemies.

197
00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:15.765
And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him

198
00:09:15.765 --> 00:09:18.245
that he loved him as his own soul.

199
00:09:18.345 --> 00:09:20.165
Now here's why that's so important.

200
00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:25.165
Because what would happen often at this time in history when

201
00:09:25.285 --> 00:09:28.765
a new regime, a new authority would enter in a new dynasty,

202
00:09:28.815 --> 00:09:32.605
began in a nation, the king steps in,

203
00:09:32.825 --> 00:09:35.845
he would kill all the descendants of the previous king

204
00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:40.025
So that none of them could come back

205
00:09:40.025 --> 00:09:42.025
and say, no, no, actually I'm supposed to be the king.

206
00:09:42.045 --> 00:09:43.585
No one can make a claim to the throne.

207
00:09:43.775 --> 00:09:47.465
They would just wipe them out so that their dynasty was

208
00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:49.785
only the one that stood.

209
00:09:49.785 --> 00:09:51.585
And so see what Jonathan did here.

210
00:09:53.615 --> 00:09:57.175
Jonathan asked David to remember Jonathan's house,

211
00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:58.775
to not cut it off.

212
00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:00.535
If that's what David was planning to do.

213
00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:06.295
David's, if it was his plan to cut off the house of Saul,

214
00:10:06.655 --> 00:10:07.655
Jonathan would've been wiped out.

215
00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:09.935
But Jonathan says, Hey, listen, we,

216
00:10:09.955 --> 00:10:11.255
we are brothers together.

217
00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:12.815
Can we, can we not do that?

218
00:10:13.275 --> 00:10:15.575
And instead, can you bless my family?

219
00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:17.815
And notice what David does? He renews the covenant.

220
00:10:18.935 --> 00:10:20.925
We'll actually see later in the ch, in the, the book

221
00:10:20.925 --> 00:10:23.605
that he does fulfill this covenant.

222
00:10:23.745 --> 00:10:26.445
But here he commits to it, says, I'm gonna bless you.

223
00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:31.085
And so they have this dialogue

224
00:10:31.085 --> 00:10:33.005
for 17 verses, what happens next?

225
00:10:33.955 --> 00:10:38.165
Well, Jonathan went to discover his father's intentions.

226
00:10:38.745 --> 00:10:40.645
He says, I'm gonna sound him out. I'm gonna figure it out.

227
00:10:40.645 --> 00:10:42.245
And so David waited, hiding.

228
00:10:44.175 --> 00:10:45.795
I'm gonna summarize the next few verses.

229
00:10:45.795 --> 00:10:47.635
But basically, David didn't go to the feast

230
00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:49.235
that he was supposed to be at.

231
00:10:49.255 --> 00:10:50.475
He would've been expected to be there.

232
00:10:50.495 --> 00:10:53.155
And first day of the feast, Saul just brushed it off like,

233
00:10:53.155 --> 00:10:54.395
oh, well, okay, maybe he's just,

234
00:10:54.825 --> 00:10:56.235
he's unclean or something, okay?

235
00:10:56.235 --> 00:10:58.435
But second day, David's not there.

236
00:10:58.435 --> 00:11:01.155
And so Saul asked Jonathan, where's David?

237
00:11:03.235 --> 00:11:05.415
And Jonathan, as he said to David, he's going

238
00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.015
to tell Saul what he said.

239
00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:10.175
Well, David went home to sacrifice with his family.

240
00:11:10.195 --> 00:11:12.495
It was an important feast they needed to sacrifice.

241
00:11:12.715 --> 00:11:13.775
That's where David is.

242
00:11:15.755 --> 00:11:19.585
Well, we're gonna pick it up now in verse 30, watch

243
00:11:19.605 --> 00:11:21.105
how Saul reacted to that one.

244
00:11:23.075 --> 00:11:24.165
Jump down, verse 30.

245
00:11:29.275 --> 00:11:32.765
Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan.

246
00:11:33.465 --> 00:11:36.925
And he said to him, you son of a perverse rebellious woman,

247
00:11:37.025 --> 00:11:39.965
one of the deepest cutting remarks you can ever say towards

248
00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:42.805
someone, do I not know that you've chosen the son of Jesse

249
00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:46.125
to your own shame, to the shame of your mother's nakedness?

250
00:11:46.385 --> 00:11:49.445
For as long as the Son of Jesse lives on the earth,

251
00:11:49.555 --> 00:11:52.605
neither you nor your kingdom shall be established.

252
00:11:53.515 --> 00:11:56.765
Therefore, send and bring him to me for he shall surely die.

253
00:11:57.545 --> 00:11:59.365
And then Jonathan answered, Saul, his father,

254
00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:00.845
why should he be put to death?

255
00:12:00.915 --> 00:12:05.385
What has he done? But Saul hurled his spear at

256
00:12:05.385 --> 00:12:06.585
him to strike him.

257
00:12:07.445 --> 00:12:08.945
So Jonathan knew that his father was

258
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.265
determined to put David to death.

259
00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:13.945
Jonathan Rose from the table in fierce anger, ate no food.

260
00:12:13.965 --> 00:12:16.305
The second day of the month, he was grieved for David

261
00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:18.225
because his father had disgraced him.

262
00:12:20.415 --> 00:12:22.075
And so not only was Saul trying to kill David.

263
00:12:22.175 --> 00:12:24.115
Now here he even tries to kill his own son.

264
00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:27.685
I had somebody earlier today say,

265
00:12:27.685 --> 00:12:30.045
why didn't you just keep the spears away from Saul?

266
00:12:30.075 --> 00:12:32.325
Like he tried to kill David with spears.

267
00:12:32.325 --> 00:12:33.405
And this one, he just picked one up.

268
00:12:33.405 --> 00:12:34.685
Like, just get rid of him.

269
00:12:34.685 --> 00:12:38.525
Like, but here he's trying to even frantically

270
00:12:39.155 --> 00:12:42.165
address every issue by trying to eliminate it.

271
00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:44.965
But I want you to notice something.

272
00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:46.525
It wasn't just that he was trying to kill Jonathan.

273
00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:49.765
Notice he didn't even understand Jonathan.

274
00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:54.265
He failed to understand his sown son.

275
00:12:56.045 --> 00:12:57.105
And here's what I mean by that.

276
00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:01.095
Saul could not figure out

277
00:13:02.725 --> 00:13:05.905
why Jonathan would not want to be the king himself.

278
00:13:09.615 --> 00:13:11.175
'cause remember, that was the typical pathway.

279
00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:15.775
The king, his oldest son, would become the next king.

280
00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:19.295
That was Jonathan. So Saul being the king,

281
00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:21.175
means Jonathan would've been the next king if you

282
00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:22.295
ran the dynasty.

283
00:13:23.315 --> 00:13:26.375
And if he wanted to be the king, since God had replaced

284
00:13:27.085 --> 00:13:29.735
Saul, this, this other dynasty was coming.

285
00:13:30.835 --> 00:13:31.975
We need to eliminate that.

286
00:13:31.995 --> 00:13:33.415
If Jonathan, you're gonna be the king.

287
00:13:37.075 --> 00:13:40.265
Again, Saul could not understand why Jonathan wouldn't want

288
00:13:40.265 --> 00:13:42.505
to walk the same path Saul had walked.

289
00:13:42.725 --> 00:13:43.945
Why wouldn't you wanna be the king?

290
00:13:44.245 --> 00:13:46.465
Why don't you wanna follow the plan that I have

291
00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:47.865
for your life, son?

292
00:13:52.805 --> 00:13:53.815
Well, Jonathan went

293
00:13:53.815 --> 00:13:58.295
and told David the bad news, which of course confirmed that

294
00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:00.175
that means David would have to be on the run the rest

295
00:14:00.175 --> 00:14:04.575
of his life, or at least until Saul died, that he would have

296
00:14:04.575 --> 00:14:08.255
to be separated from, from Jonathan the rest of Saul's life.

297
00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:14.055
But watch again down in verse 42.

298
00:14:15.085 --> 00:14:16.895
This is the very end of the chapter.

299
00:14:19.785 --> 00:14:22.135
Again, a reiteration of this covenant

300
00:14:23.845 --> 00:14:27.695
that would last the rest of their lives, even

301
00:14:27.755 --> 00:14:31.055
as they parted ways, as they ran away from each other.

302
00:14:31.185 --> 00:14:34.695
Watch this verse 42, then Jonathan said to David,

303
00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:36.095
go in peace

304
00:14:37.045 --> 00:14:39.455
because we have sworn both of us in the name

305
00:14:39.455 --> 00:14:43.335
of the Lord saying, the Lord shall be between me and you,

306
00:14:43.595 --> 00:14:46.535
and between my offspring and your offspring forever.

307
00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:50.495
And he rose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.

308
00:14:53.135 --> 00:14:55.155
Now, we might skip over that phrase, go in peace.

309
00:14:56.065 --> 00:14:59.915
That is all over the Bible as a, an expression

310
00:14:59.935 --> 00:15:01.395
of divine approval.

311
00:15:03.215 --> 00:15:06.145
Go in peace. Go in peace.

312
00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:09.305
Again, David's on the run for his life.

313
00:15:11.585 --> 00:15:15.125
But if you remember last week, like Ryan, so well said,

314
00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:18.885
because Yahweh, the Lord is involved here.

315
00:15:19.425 --> 00:15:22.125
You can have peace even when you're on the

316
00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:23.205
run for your life.

317
00:15:24.065 --> 00:15:25.805
That's what Jonathan says, go in peace.

318
00:15:27.265 --> 00:15:30.165
You Will succeed. You will have victory here.

319
00:15:31.065 --> 00:15:35.215
Go in peace. God is with you. Jonathan believed that.

320
00:15:38.245 --> 00:15:41.945
Now, here's the next question. That's what happened.

321
00:15:41.945 --> 00:15:45.995
But but what does all this mean? That's the story.

322
00:15:46.095 --> 00:15:48.035
But what does this mean?

323
00:15:48.175 --> 00:15:50.675
As we've often seen in one Samuel already,

324
00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:53.355
there's a contrast very clearly here, right?

325
00:15:55.105 --> 00:15:57.995
There's two perspectives on how people responded

326
00:15:57.995 --> 00:16:00.675
to God's anointing of David as the next king.

327
00:16:02.015 --> 00:16:03.395
And it shows us what this means.

328
00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:05.275
Well, first, we've already seen this repeatedly throughout

329
00:16:05.275 --> 00:16:09.595
the book, that Saul clearly opposed God's will.

330
00:16:11.115 --> 00:16:14.155
I mean, Saul was completely against Yahweh's will

331
00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:16.355
in every way, in every step,

332
00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:19.635
which led to his removal, right?

333
00:16:19.635 --> 00:16:20.835
He had lack of faith in God.

334
00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:23.915
So he, he was removed from the kingship,

335
00:16:25.615 --> 00:16:27.035
but he's still in the position.

336
00:16:29.045 --> 00:16:31.625
And his opposition to God's will showed up like this.

337
00:16:31.685 --> 00:16:32.945
He could have humbled himself.

338
00:16:33.165 --> 00:16:36.345
He could have submitted to the plan of God through David.

339
00:16:36.725 --> 00:16:38.305
He could have gotten outta the way

340
00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.305
and said, okay, David's the king.

341
00:16:40.365 --> 00:16:44.225
Now I'm out. I abdicate my throne. David's the king.

342
00:16:44.225 --> 00:16:46.305
This is who God said is gonna be it.

343
00:16:47.085 --> 00:16:50.425
He could have done that, and he would've saved himself

344
00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:52.425
and saved his people a whole lot

345
00:16:52.425 --> 00:16:56.245
of pain, But he never did.

346
00:16:58.005 --> 00:17:01.735
In fact, the rest of the book is the story

347
00:17:01.795 --> 00:17:05.135
of Saul trying to remove David from the equation.

348
00:17:06.965 --> 00:17:08.305
That's his whole focus.

349
00:17:09.335 --> 00:17:11.585
Instead of being the king leading his people towards Yahweh,

350
00:17:11.585 --> 00:17:13.545
he was just trying to eliminate David.

351
00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:18.745
He never submitted to God's plan, never submitted to

352
00:17:20.195 --> 00:17:23.745
God's will because it went against his selfish heart.

353
00:17:28.795 --> 00:17:31.775
That's Saul. But Jonathan,

354
00:17:33.335 --> 00:17:34.455
Jonathan on the other hand, he,

355
00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:38.135
he is faithfully seeking Yahweh's.

356
00:17:38.135 --> 00:17:41.715
Will Saul clearly opposed Yahweh's, will

357
00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:45.155
Jonathan faithfully sought God's will.

358
00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:52.245
He was even following God by supporting

359
00:17:52.265 --> 00:17:53.925
and following David above

360
00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:55.725
and beyond his own father

361
00:17:57.585 --> 00:17:59.125
who wasn't seeking God's will.

362
00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:01.725
He said, I'm following God's plan here.

363
00:18:04.135 --> 00:18:05.155
Now, here's the interesting thing.

364
00:18:05.155 --> 00:18:06.475
This is where the tension comes.

365
00:18:06.495 --> 00:18:08.155
He never abandons his father.

366
00:18:09.715 --> 00:18:11.335
He even goes back to his father

367
00:18:11.435 --> 00:18:13.415
and dies with his father in battle.

368
00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:21.285
Yet his

369
00:18:21.285 --> 00:18:22.285
heart was with David, right?

370
00:18:24.415 --> 00:18:25.875
His heart was with David.

371
00:18:25.975 --> 00:18:27.355
He needed to honor his father,

372
00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:30.555
but he had to follow God by honoring

373
00:18:30.615 --> 00:18:32.355
and have his heart towards David.

374
00:18:32.575 --> 00:18:33.595
Why was his heart that way?

375
00:18:33.595 --> 00:18:35.475
Because he knew David was God's anointed.

376
00:18:35.475 --> 00:18:39.755
He knew that was God's plan again, even though he knew

377
00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:41.995
that meant he was never gonna be the king himself.

378
00:18:44.245 --> 00:18:46.225
He was supposed to be next in line,

379
00:18:46.365 --> 00:18:47.945
but he says, I don't care.

380
00:18:49.655 --> 00:18:50.785
That doesn't matter to me.

381
00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:54.505
That doesn't matter because I'm abandoning personal, uh,

382
00:18:54.745 --> 00:18:56.105
a pursuit of personal greatness.

383
00:18:56.285 --> 00:18:57.505
I'm abandoning that completely

384
00:18:57.615 --> 00:19:00.385
because my commitment to God must have priority.

385
00:19:02.025 --> 00:19:03.825
I don't need to follow my own pathway

386
00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:05.145
or my father's pathway.

387
00:19:05.365 --> 00:19:06.585
I'm following God's pathway.

388
00:19:09.855 --> 00:19:12.555
And so in that, even his abandonment

389
00:19:12.555 --> 00:19:13.955
of personal greatness in

390
00:19:13.955 --> 00:19:16.475
that we actually see Jonathan's greatness, right?

391
00:19:18.295 --> 00:19:22.185
Because his, his willingness to count it all as loss

392
00:19:22.405 --> 00:19:25.385
for the sake of obedience to Yahweh, he abandoned

393
00:19:25.385 --> 00:19:27.465
because he knew that was priority

394
00:19:27.575 --> 00:19:29.025
over anything else in his life.

395
00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:36.645
What a contrast, Saul, Jonathan, how each responded

396
00:19:36.645 --> 00:19:40.735
to the Lord here, this is what it means.

397
00:19:44.055 --> 00:19:47.195
But a good teacher always asks a further question when it

398
00:19:47.195 --> 00:19:48.555
comes to what it seems like.

399
00:19:48.555 --> 00:19:51.995
All right? That's the end. A good teacher asks a further

400
00:19:52.355 --> 00:19:55.475
question, typically a question, something like, okay, why?

401
00:19:58.135 --> 00:20:02.055
Why does this matter? Right? That's, that's the question.

402
00:20:02.155 --> 00:20:04.385
Now, here's what it means. Okay?

403
00:20:04.385 --> 00:20:05.385
We, we can see the contrast.

404
00:20:05.385 --> 00:20:07.105
We can see Saul and Jonathan's responses.

405
00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:09.505
But, but why is this here? Why does it matter?

406
00:20:12.955 --> 00:20:15.405
Well, I wanna share just three lessons from this

407
00:20:16.235 --> 00:20:17.725
that I feel like we can apply

408
00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:19.685
to our lives showing us why this matters.

409
00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:23.045
Why does this picture get painted the way it is?

410
00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:25.285
Why does it speak to us and what does it do for us today?

411
00:20:25.285 --> 00:20:28.725
Well, here's part of what chapter 20 teaches us.

412
00:20:30.175 --> 00:20:34.765
First, it's that friendships can be life-giving and deep

413
00:20:36.305 --> 00:20:37.885
and friendships can be

414
00:20:38.635 --> 00:20:42.325
deep life-giving nourishing in our lives.

415
00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:49.685
We saw this a couple weeks ago when David

416
00:20:49.825 --> 00:20:52.765
and Jonathan committed, uh, to each other.

417
00:20:52.765 --> 00:20:55.285
There, there was this sense of, of Jonathan committing

418
00:20:55.285 --> 00:20:56.325
to David as the new king.

419
00:20:56.325 --> 00:20:57.765
There was a com, a covenant there.

420
00:20:57.945 --> 00:21:00.005
But here it's fully formed.

421
00:21:00.115 --> 00:21:04.045
It's fully showing up in chapter 20 where they're willing

422
00:21:04.045 --> 00:21:06.485
to protect one another in risky ways.

423
00:21:07.915 --> 00:21:10.645
David's promising to bless Jonathan's descendants.

424
00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:12.125
There was tearful goodbyes.

425
00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:15.205
There's love beyond anything that's just surface level.

426
00:21:15.205 --> 00:21:18.085
There's a soul level kind of love here.

427
00:21:20.235 --> 00:21:21.825
Again, don't think too, too much of this.

428
00:21:22.165 --> 00:21:25.385
The text doesn't let us, but what does that mean for us?

429
00:21:25.445 --> 00:21:26.865
Why is this here the way it is?

430
00:21:28.615 --> 00:21:30.385
Well, I know that many of us have been hurt

431
00:21:30.385 --> 00:21:31.545
by friendships over the years,

432
00:21:34.865 --> 00:21:39.035
Like Deep pain from friends

433
00:21:39.135 --> 00:21:40.715
who turned on you.

434
00:21:43.215 --> 00:21:46.515
But here's the truth. Our experience does not mean

435
00:21:46.515 --> 00:21:50.155
that friendships like this are actually impossible,

436
00:21:53.155 --> 00:21:55.245
because where did their commitment come from?

437
00:21:56.055 --> 00:21:58.445
Where did that deep soul level love come from?

438
00:21:58.445 --> 00:22:00.965
Well, first, it was because of their shared faith in Yahweh

439
00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:05.765
That Their hearts, both of them were primarily

440
00:22:06.605 --> 00:22:07.605
oriented toward the Lord.

441
00:22:07.715 --> 00:22:11.445
Like that was focus number one, our hearts towards God.

442
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:15.345
Along with that, there was also a shared mission,

443
00:22:15.985 --> 00:22:18.985
a shared pursuit of the most important things.

444
00:22:19.055 --> 00:22:21.945
They were both focused on what God wanted them to do, not

445
00:22:21.945 --> 00:22:24.705
what they wanted to do or their selfish desires wanted.

446
00:22:24.845 --> 00:22:27.065
It was what does God want? And that's what I want.

447
00:22:31.985 --> 00:22:34.945
Do you have friends like this, right?

448
00:22:34.945 --> 00:22:37.225
Like buzzing woody maybe. Like you kind of see that, right?

449
00:22:38.005 --> 00:22:39.385
You got a friend. I don't know if

450
00:22:39.385 --> 00:22:40.825
that's like, but you see what I mean?

451
00:22:40.825 --> 00:22:42.945
Like there's, there's a depth to theirs

452
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:44.545
that is way different.

453
00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:49.485
Serious, though, a lot of us have a whole lot

454
00:22:49.485 --> 00:22:54.185
of acquaintances, but very few, if any,

455
00:22:55.335 --> 00:22:58.265
friendships where we walk away, filled up,

456
00:22:58.475 --> 00:23:01.305
where we walk away sacrificed for,

457
00:23:01.325 --> 00:23:02.825
and we sacrifice for them.

458
00:23:02.825 --> 00:23:06.065
And there's a deep, deep, deep love

459
00:23:07.715 --> 00:23:09.105
where they know everything about you

460
00:23:09.405 --> 00:23:10.625
and they still yell, love you.

461
00:23:10.625 --> 00:23:13.665
The same. Do we have those?

462
00:23:16.475 --> 00:23:17.915
I fear that most of us don't.

463
00:23:20.335 --> 00:23:21.275
And so if you're sitting there and

464
00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:21.955
you think, okay, well that's me.

465
00:23:21.995 --> 00:23:23.435
I, I feel alone right now. I don't have

466
00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:24.555
those kind of people in my life.

467
00:23:24.555 --> 00:23:27.795
What do I do? You feel alone? I don't have that.

468
00:23:27.825 --> 00:23:30.595
Okay, what do I do? Well, you have to take a risk.

469
00:23:32.465 --> 00:23:33.525
You have to step out.

470
00:23:34.185 --> 00:23:36.925
You, you have to take a risk, step out.

471
00:23:37.025 --> 00:23:40.485
You have to realize that love is costly,

472
00:23:40.715 --> 00:23:45.595
love is risky, and you might get hurt again.

473
00:23:49.695 --> 00:23:51.595
But if you never step out in faith,

474
00:23:51.775 --> 00:23:53.675
you will never reap the rewards

475
00:23:54.055 --> 00:23:56.075
of what's on the other side of that step.

476
00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:02.985
And so take that step. Open up your life.

477
00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:06.585
Trust the Lord as you seek this, right?

478
00:24:06.585 --> 00:24:07.705
You're not trusting that person.

479
00:24:08.105 --> 00:24:09.225
Ultimately, you're trusting the Lord

480
00:24:09.455 --> 00:24:12.225
through his means to encourage you.

481
00:24:15.235 --> 00:24:16.735
And let me just say, as a side note,

482
00:24:17.805 --> 00:24:19.935
I've had too many conversations with people who tried that.

483
00:24:20.115 --> 00:24:23.215
And they got just ghosted. They people left.

484
00:24:23.215 --> 00:24:26.175
They didn't respond and bailed on him.

485
00:24:28.055 --> 00:24:32.545
Sat with a young man just this week who tried to reach out

486
00:24:32.945 --> 00:24:35.305
'cause we'd connected him with someone tried to reach out

487
00:24:35.325 --> 00:24:36.905
and the guy just never responded.

488
00:24:36.905 --> 00:24:38.265
And he was so discouraged by that.

489
00:24:38.265 --> 00:24:40.105
Listen, if somebody reaches out to you

490
00:24:40.285 --> 00:24:41.625
and somebody says, I need help.

491
00:24:41.865 --> 00:24:43.825
I need a friend. Don't bail.

492
00:24:45.215 --> 00:24:47.545
Like spend some time sacrifice.

493
00:24:47.655 --> 00:24:49.825
Make it a point to engage them, to care for them,

494
00:24:49.885 --> 00:24:53.345
to befriend them, grow deep with them, give life back

495
00:24:53.345 --> 00:24:54.585
and forth to one another.

496
00:24:55.285 --> 00:24:58.565
We don't wanna hurt anyone. It happens too often.

497
00:25:01.555 --> 00:25:03.255
But Jonathan and David show us that that kind

498
00:25:03.255 --> 00:25:04.935
of friendship is actually possible.

499
00:25:08.455 --> 00:25:10.835
But here's something else. Chapter 20 teaches us,

500
00:25:13.275 --> 00:25:17.245
it's that family can be hard and soul straining.

501
00:25:20.795 --> 00:25:23.735
Family can be hard and soul straining.

502
00:25:23.735 --> 00:25:25.855
That was Jonathan and Saul's relationship, right?

503
00:25:29.485 --> 00:25:32.615
When a family has an imbalanced spiritual dynamic

504
00:25:32.805 --> 00:25:34.695
that pulls at its very fabric,

505
00:25:37.405 --> 00:25:38.945
and some of you know what I'm talking about, right?

506
00:25:38.945 --> 00:25:42.025
Some of you have parents who are not believers

507
00:25:43.355 --> 00:25:46.375
and you felt this tension that as you follow Jesus

508
00:25:46.435 --> 00:25:47.775
and you're seeking to obey him,

509
00:25:47.775 --> 00:25:49.735
they might completely disagree with everything you're doing.

510
00:25:52.755 --> 00:25:57.285
Some of you have children who are pursuing a lifestyle

511
00:25:57.395 --> 00:25:58.805
against everything you've taught,

512
00:25:58.805 --> 00:26:01.165
against everything you've modeled for them their whole life.

513
00:26:01.165 --> 00:26:03.125
And it makes family gatherings really difficult.

514
00:26:07.845 --> 00:26:09.735
It's similar with Jonathan and Saul, right?

515
00:26:09.765 --> 00:26:13.695
They were at opposite ends in their, their faith,

516
00:26:13.785 --> 00:26:15.455
their devotion to Yahweh.

517
00:26:16.655 --> 00:26:18.255
Jonathan seeking to obey God,

518
00:26:18.355 --> 00:26:20.175
I'm doing everything I can to follow God.

519
00:26:20.605 --> 00:26:23.055
Saul just acting religious at times when it made it

520
00:26:23.055 --> 00:26:26.695
convenient, opposite ends of the spectrum

521
00:26:27.875 --> 00:26:30.535
to such an extent that Saul could not even see

522
00:26:30.535 --> 00:26:32.855
that Jonathan was trying to honor the Lord

523
00:26:33.155 --> 00:26:36.055
by following David, even trying

524
00:26:36.055 --> 00:26:40.375
to kill his own son For his faith.

525
00:26:45.885 --> 00:26:48.625
My wife and I have been in ministry long enough now

526
00:26:48.625 --> 00:26:51.745
that we have seen variations of families,

527
00:26:51.815 --> 00:26:55.825
this dysfunctional, many of our college students, many

528
00:26:55.825 --> 00:26:57.985
of our young couples as we're walking

529
00:26:57.985 --> 00:27:01.025
through premarital stuff with them in our years of ministry,

530
00:27:01.025 --> 00:27:02.665
we've seen this over and over

531
00:27:02.765 --> 00:27:05.745
and over, where these people we're sitting with in church,

532
00:27:05.925 --> 00:27:08.385
in, in times together premarital,

533
00:27:08.605 --> 00:27:09.785
and we're talking with them that

534
00:27:09.785 --> 00:27:10.945
they are closer to each other.

535
00:27:10.945 --> 00:27:13.185
They're closer to their peers and and brothers

536
00:27:13.185 --> 00:27:14.385
and sisters in Christ in the church.

537
00:27:14.385 --> 00:27:16.105
They're closer to them than they are

538
00:27:16.105 --> 00:27:17.545
to their biological families.

539
00:27:22.675 --> 00:27:24.455
Now, that's something the only Holy Spirit can do

540
00:27:24.485 --> 00:27:25.775
because they didn't know each other

541
00:27:25.775 --> 00:27:27.335
before they showed up in Weatherford, right?

542
00:27:27.335 --> 00:27:29.935
And it's all of a sudden now God's knit them together.

543
00:27:30.635 --> 00:27:33.135
But think of the tension that puts right.

544
00:27:34.615 --> 00:27:36.735
A young couple trying to follow Jesus in their marriage

545
00:27:36.735 --> 00:27:39.055
and both their families are pulling 'em apart part.

546
00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:45.335
But here's what that means. It makes it essential

547
00:27:45.565 --> 00:27:49.735
that the church is a place for those kind of people to land.

548
00:27:51.595 --> 00:27:54.085
That they feel like their their safe.

549
00:27:54.085 --> 00:27:57.005
Because if their pursuit of Jesus puts them at odds

550
00:27:57.235 --> 00:28:00.645
with their biological family, they better know

551
00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:03.965
that they have a family here no matter what.

552
00:28:07.965 --> 00:28:10.345
In fact, it was one of those college students in Weatherford

553
00:28:10.345 --> 00:28:13.105
who pointed the following verse out in Psalm 68.

554
00:28:13.105 --> 00:28:14.905
I don't know if I'd ever seen this in this way before,

555
00:28:15.325 --> 00:28:17.225
but it speaks to this situation.

556
00:28:18.995 --> 00:28:23.225
Psalm 68, verses five and six says, father of the fatherless

557
00:28:23.605 --> 00:28:27.505
and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation.

558
00:28:28.525 --> 00:28:31.065
God settles the solitary in a home.

559
00:28:33.385 --> 00:28:35.365
Oh, and we'd think of orphans and wi. Okay, great.

560
00:28:35.585 --> 00:28:38.965
But what about somebody like Jonathan who's been kind

561
00:28:38.965 --> 00:28:41.445
of run off from his family and you're pursuing Jesus

562
00:28:41.545 --> 00:28:43.565
and your family says, I don't care about that

563
00:28:43.745 --> 00:28:45.405
and you can't come home, or whatever it is.

564
00:28:45.745 --> 00:28:50.175
Do they have a home? Okay, so how do we apply this?

565
00:28:52.965 --> 00:28:55.435
Lemme talk to you parents first, including myself.

566
00:28:58.715 --> 00:29:01.065
Don't get in the way of your kids following the Lord.

567
00:29:05.775 --> 00:29:07.185
Like if they wanna move overseas

568
00:29:07.205 --> 00:29:09.705
to share the gospel, celebrate that.

569
00:29:10.835 --> 00:29:12.825
Don't try to say No, you can take my grand babies away.

570
00:29:12.915 --> 00:29:15.185
Don't ever like you celebrate that.

571
00:29:16.425 --> 00:29:18.295
'cause They feel God's call in their life

572
00:29:18.295 --> 00:29:19.975
to go share the gospel and sacrifice

573
00:29:19.975 --> 00:29:21.055
and cost for everything.

574
00:29:21.055 --> 00:29:22.295
Like if they don't wanna go to college,

575
00:29:22.915 --> 00:29:24.655
if they don't wanna get the same degree that you got

576
00:29:24.655 --> 00:29:26.295
and follow through and take the family business,

577
00:29:26.535 --> 00:29:28.255
whatever it is, instead they wanna go to seminary,

578
00:29:28.425 --> 00:29:30.495
serve the Lord vocationally with their career.

579
00:29:30.915 --> 00:29:32.335
You say yes to that

580
00:29:35.165 --> 00:29:36.465
And on and on and on.

581
00:29:36.605 --> 00:29:37.985
We can go, right? We can say,

582
00:29:38.295 --> 00:29:39.665
stop getting in the way of them.

583
00:29:39.765 --> 00:29:41.925
And you're, you're completely not following Jesus

584
00:29:41.985 --> 00:29:43.405
and they're wanting to, and you're saying, no,

585
00:29:43.465 --> 00:29:44.525
I'm too tired to go.

586
00:29:44.625 --> 00:29:46.165
No, you. You get 'em to church, right?

587
00:29:46.165 --> 00:29:47.165
You do these kind of things

588
00:29:47.465 --> 00:29:49.645
to foster their hunger for the Lord.

589
00:29:51.135 --> 00:29:53.685
Lemme talk to you. Kids, children, students, whatever.

590
00:29:53.935 --> 00:29:55.285
Don't antagonize your parents.

591
00:29:56.095 --> 00:29:57.765
Don't push their buttons on purpose just

592
00:29:57.765 --> 00:29:59.205
because you feel more spiritual than they are.

593
00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:00.845
Right? That doesn't work. Either.

594
00:30:00.985 --> 00:30:03.045
You respect, you honor as best you can,

595
00:30:03.265 --> 00:30:05.445
but you prioritize Jesus over everything else.

596
00:30:08.635 --> 00:30:11.695
Here's the key, right? All of us, every single, no matter

597
00:30:11.695 --> 00:30:15.015
what age, pursue the Lord wholeheartedly, right?

598
00:30:15.015 --> 00:30:16.015
That's the way it's gonna work out.

599
00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:19.305
And we're just fostering this in feeding

600
00:30:19.325 --> 00:30:20.465
us amongst each other.

601
00:30:21.805 --> 00:30:25.065
Family can be hard, can be soul straining,

602
00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:26.425
but it can also be life-giving.

603
00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:27.545
It can be encouraging.

604
00:30:27.565 --> 00:30:29.865
It can be discipling your own children

605
00:30:29.965 --> 00:30:31.505
and watching God do something with that.

606
00:30:34.005 --> 00:30:35.465
But here's what it all sets up.

607
00:30:35.565 --> 00:30:37.425
The last point today, really why this

608
00:30:37.425 --> 00:30:39.545
chapter actually matters the most.

609
00:30:41.425 --> 00:30:45.145
Jonathan's life shows us that faith will be costly,

610
00:30:46.325 --> 00:30:47.945
yet it will be ever rewarding.

611
00:30:50.435 --> 00:30:53.625
Faith will be costly.

612
00:30:55.225 --> 00:30:56.845
We don't like talking about this very much

613
00:30:57.125 --> 00:30:58.885
'cause it kind of pushes against our comfort.

614
00:31:00.015 --> 00:31:04.645
Faith will cost you, but it will be ever rewarding.

615
00:31:05.765 --> 00:31:08.085
Jonathan knew he was not supposed to abandon his father,

616
00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:10.325
but he also knew that his commitment

617
00:31:10.325 --> 00:31:12.405
to his father could never claim

618
00:31:13.245 --> 00:31:15.165
priority over his commitment to Yahweh.

619
00:31:18.815 --> 00:31:20.395
And that cost him something, didn't it?

620
00:31:22.545 --> 00:31:24.875
That cost him the future kingship.

621
00:31:26.575 --> 00:31:28.635
It almost cost him his life getting

622
00:31:28.635 --> 00:31:29.955
pinned to the wall with a spear.

623
00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:33.435
It eventually does cost him his life in battle.

624
00:31:38.265 --> 00:31:41.365
But how do you think God saw Jonathan's actions?

625
00:31:44.175 --> 00:31:46.195
He was pleased with Jonathan's faith.

626
00:31:47.095 --> 00:31:49.195
He was pleased with Jonathan's obedience,

627
00:31:49.615 --> 00:31:51.195
his commitment to God's plan.

628
00:31:51.255 --> 00:31:53.595
He was pleased with Jonathan.

629
00:31:53.595 --> 00:31:55.675
Listen, it's no different for us today.

630
00:31:59.765 --> 00:32:00.995
Again, we don't like talking about this,

631
00:32:01.015 --> 00:32:03.875
but God sent his son in such a way

632
00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:05.475
that it would divide people.

633
00:32:06.895 --> 00:32:08.755
It would divide even households.

634
00:32:11.235 --> 00:32:13.755
I mean, Jesus said it. Listen to Matthew chapter 10.

635
00:32:15.345 --> 00:32:17.835
This is verses 37 through 39.

636
00:32:18.805 --> 00:32:21.515
Jesus says, whoever loves father

637
00:32:21.615 --> 00:32:24.235
or mother more than me is not worthy of me.

638
00:32:25.555 --> 00:32:26.965
Whoever loves son

639
00:32:27.025 --> 00:32:29.845
or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

640
00:32:30.505 --> 00:32:32.165
And whoever does not take his cross

641
00:32:32.465 --> 00:32:35.005
and follow me is not worthy of me.

642
00:32:35.755 --> 00:32:39.245
Whoever finds his life here will lose it.

643
00:32:39.345 --> 00:32:44.125
And whoever loses his life here for my sake will find it.

644
00:32:45.755 --> 00:32:49.765
Does that not sound so radical to our modern ears?

645
00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:53.195
Like that sounds completely outta whack?

646
00:32:53.195 --> 00:32:54.595
Like Jesus could never have said that? No.

647
00:32:54.835 --> 00:32:56.795
'cause family is most important to us.

648
00:32:58.255 --> 00:33:00.355
We revolve our whole lives around our kids,

649
00:33:00.375 --> 00:33:02.675
and we say, this is the most of, we're gonna get everything

650
00:33:02.695 --> 00:33:04.835
for them and make it right for them.

651
00:33:05.685 --> 00:33:06.875
Jesus, what did he say?

652
00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:11.535
He said that your kids cannot become an idol.

653
00:33:13.175 --> 00:33:15.545
Your kids cannot become preeminent.

654
00:33:16.465 --> 00:33:20.985
A good thing cannot become a God thing in your life.

655
00:33:24.755 --> 00:33:28.225
There are so many distractions that compete for our focus.

656
00:33:28.295 --> 00:33:29.665
They compete for our attention.

657
00:33:29.935 --> 00:33:33.265
They compete for our devotion, for our time, for our energy.

658
00:33:33.645 --> 00:33:38.145
But coming to Jesus means dying to self.

659
00:33:41.805 --> 00:33:44.585
And even though that death to self means you have

660
00:33:44.585 --> 00:33:46.585
to set aside what you want,

661
00:33:50.015 --> 00:33:51.535
E even though submitting to him

662
00:33:51.635 --> 00:33:54.055
and his will like for Jonathan was costly,

663
00:33:54.155 --> 00:33:56.735
and it is costly, it will be costly for you.

664
00:33:56.885 --> 00:33:59.895
Setting aside all those desires saying, I don't want that.

665
00:34:00.015 --> 00:34:02.055
I want you. You set up, it's costly.

666
00:34:02.115 --> 00:34:04.655
Yes, but it is absolutely worth it.

667
00:34:07.265 --> 00:34:10.445
How? Because you're not the first.

668
00:34:11.495 --> 00:34:14.965
Jesus himself took up his cross

669
00:34:15.225 --> 00:34:19.925
to pay your price, to make you worthy before God.

670
00:34:22.605 --> 00:34:26.145
But that's not even all of it. Like, yes, he died.

671
00:34:26.145 --> 00:34:28.505
He, he said, you pick up your cross. But he did it first.

672
00:34:28.685 --> 00:34:30.345
He took up his cross to make you worthy.

673
00:34:30.405 --> 00:34:32.705
But that's not even all because he didn't stay dead.

674
00:34:33.025 --> 00:34:34.345
Remember, right? That's not the end of the story.

675
00:34:34.485 --> 00:34:38.545
He now freely gives life to those who do die

676
00:34:38.545 --> 00:34:40.345
to themselves for his sake.

677
00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:44.065
So you die, okay? But you know what? You get life.

678
00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:47.625
He says, I give you life that you're dead.

679
00:34:47.965 --> 00:34:50.105
I'm dead in my trespasses and sins,

680
00:34:50.205 --> 00:34:54.385
but in him, I am made alive spiritually and forever.

681
00:34:56.975 --> 00:34:58.795
And that happens because we've seen him.

682
00:34:59.885 --> 00:35:02.435
We've seen him as better than anything else.

683
00:35:02.775 --> 00:35:05.515
We say, God, I want to obey your will. God.

684
00:35:05.635 --> 00:35:08.555
I want to crucify my desires.

685
00:35:10.085 --> 00:35:13.985
He says, okay, here's life and life abundant.

686
00:35:16.525 --> 00:35:20.465
So is it costly to follow Jesus? Absolutely.

687
00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:25.495
It's, but

688
00:35:25.555 --> 00:35:28.455
Romans eight says that the sufferings

689
00:35:28.635 --> 00:35:33.055
of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory

690
00:35:33.085 --> 00:35:34.855
that is to be revealed to us.

691
00:35:36.905 --> 00:35:38.365
It is costly. You suffer.

692
00:35:38.795 --> 00:35:42.485
It's not even close, not worth comparing to the glory

693
00:35:42.555 --> 00:35:44.245
that is to be revealed to us.

694
00:35:44.465 --> 00:35:47.765
And until that time comes, listen, I am sure it continues.

695
00:35:47.835 --> 00:35:50.845
That neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers,

696
00:35:50.865 --> 00:35:53.765
nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,

697
00:35:53.905 --> 00:35:57.205
nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,

698
00:35:57.475 --> 00:35:59.725
will be able to separate us from the love

699
00:35:59.725 --> 00:36:02.045
of God in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

700
00:36:03.705 --> 00:36:07.325
The cost is high, But did you see it?

701
00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:12.965
The rewards are infinitely higher.

702
00:36:15.865 --> 00:36:19.285
How do you know the love of God? You say, I'm out.

703
00:36:19.895 --> 00:36:23.485
Jesus, I need you. And nothing

704
00:36:25.725 --> 00:36:27.525
separates you from that love.

705
00:36:29.005 --> 00:36:31.445
Whatever cost, whatever sacrifice, whatever suffering.

706
00:36:31.445 --> 00:36:33.045
It's not worth comparing to the glory,

707
00:36:33.185 --> 00:36:34.565
but it's also never going

708
00:36:34.565 --> 00:36:36.325
to separate you from the love of God.

709
00:36:36.645 --> 00:36:38.525
Jonathan understood the love of God

710
00:36:38.545 --> 00:36:40.965
for the first time in his life, and he said, I'm in.

711
00:36:41.665 --> 00:36:46.325
And God said, I, yeah, let's go. Same for you.

712
00:36:48.785 --> 00:36:52.965
The cost is high, but the rewards are ever higher.

713
00:36:54.225 --> 00:36:56.485
So trust him. Trust him.
