16
00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:19.285
I just turned it on. I'm ready. It's ready to go. Mm-hmm.

00:01:20.695 --> 00:01:22.805
Thank you. Sherry, you not staying?

Huh? Oh, you got the girl cut. Thank you. Alright.

19
00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:35.085
Thank you very much. You, did we follow that?

20
00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:37.245
I mean, is there homework? And we have to,

21
00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:39.325
and if you're taking this, I'm not taking the

22
00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:40.685
class, although I'd love to.

23
00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:47.205
Do we have extra values for that now? We saw?

24
00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:54.525
Yeah. It was on a day or two.

25
00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:01.925
No, we we did, but they sold out quick. So a good

26
00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.405
Discernment or I wouldn't even even talk

27
00:02:03.405 --> 00:02:07.845
about There he is.

28
00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:11.845
He's back here. Should never doubted me.

29
00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:13.685
You missed last week, didn't you?

30
00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:24.085
Here? Oh, I may forgot to do that.

31
00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:31.365
You got all your assignment done? Of course.

32
00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:33.765
Yep. Good. Finished about 20 minutes

33
00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:34.785
Ago. Alright.

34
00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:35.115

35
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.085
Sunday. I,

36
00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:52.085
when I was added to the group, it was just the teachers,

37
00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:55.605
the teachers group, not just the

38
00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:00.725
Teachers. It was

39
00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:03.045
like the ones that had been teaching. Oh yeah.

40
00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:07.605
It wasn't the regular. That was a

41
00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:15.685
we praying, we wanted the men to be part of the prayer

42
00:03:15.685 --> 00:03:16.085
because

43
00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:23.085
gonna

44
00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:26.805
Go ahead and get started. I think we're ready

45
00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:28.065
To go. Yes,

46
00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:28.945
sir.

47
00:03:31.475 --> 00:03:32.685
Well, good evening everybody.

48
00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:36.325
Thank you. Thanks.

49
00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:39.805
I love the responses.

50
00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:42.165
Um, we'll go ahead and get started

51
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:46.405
and we can let people trickle in who want to come here

52
00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:51.765
after the buzzer, but if you have not gotten

53
00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.325
handouts, they're up here.

54
00:03:54.545 --> 00:03:57.405
So there's two and a memory verse.

55
00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:00.045
Does everybody have the two handouts and the memory verse?

56
00:04:01.725 --> 00:04:03.965
I don't have reverse One reverse. Okay.

57
00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:08.445
Most important Thing to sign that role

58
00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:10.665
And sign the roll.

59
00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:19.285
All right, well welcome. We've made it to, oh,

60
00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:20.645
I thought I had the week number up there.

61
00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:23.205
Maybe I've got it on the handout. I think this is week six.

62
00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:26.725
Yep. Okay. Of systematic theology if you made it this far.

63
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.205
Wow. Good for you.

64
00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:33.645
Um, and we're gonna be, uh, tackling a tough one tonight.

65
00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:35.485
So we're gonna be talking about the trinity

66
00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:40.365
and this is one of those doctrines that, um,

67
00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:43.285
I think will make your head spin a bit.

68
00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:45.565
And if you were here two weeks ago

69
00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:48.525
and I taught on the meat communicable attributes I told you

70
00:04:48.525 --> 00:04:49.965
that would make your head spin.

71
00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:52.005
I think they all kind of make your head spin a little bit.

72
00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:56.685
But this one specifically will tonight come on in

73
00:04:58.695 --> 00:04:59.695
Right there.

74
00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:04.205
Alright. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna pray

75
00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:05.765
for us in just a minute,

76
00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:08.125
but I always want to have kind of a cold open

77
00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:12.365
and why this doctrine is important.

78
00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:16.005
Okay? Lemme just ask the question.

79
00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:17.685
I wasn't going to, but I'm gonna,

80
00:05:17.905 --> 00:05:19.605
why is this doctrine important?

81
00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:21.965
Why is the trinity important?

82
00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:26.485
Helps us understand the nature of God.

83
00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:30.645
Yeah. It helps us understand who God is.

84
00:05:31.715 --> 00:05:34.205
Each one has a role And each,

85
00:05:34.715 --> 00:05:36.445
Each of the eternity has a

86
00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:37.925
Role, whatever we're gonna call that

87
00:05:38.345 --> 00:05:39.345
Yes.

88
00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:42.525
Has a role. Right? So father, son will, right

89
00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:46.525
Holly, he is was so prevalent nature world

90
00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:52.845
that monotheism is expressed in that trinity.

91
00:05:53.865 --> 00:05:56.765
And that's just an important fact. It's not

92
00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.065
How it feels.

93
00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:02.485
It's tomorrow feels expressing itself.

94
00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:05.285
And we're gonna talk about that

95
00:06:05.285 --> 00:06:09.165
because that of all the critics out there,

96
00:06:10.545 --> 00:06:12.805
that's one of the things that trips up people the most.

97
00:06:13.595 --> 00:06:17.245
They would say that we would be worshiping three guys.

98
00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:20.925
And that three in one concept is just

99
00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:23.445
really hard to sink in.

100
00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:27.165
Right? Anything else?

101
00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:31.005
Why the trinity, why this doctrine is important?

102
00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:36.885
Well, I'm gonna show you two reasons here

103
00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:40.685
and we're gonna start with something we might not always

104
00:06:40.755 --> 00:06:42.805
talk about in church.

105
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:48.125
But I'm gonna read a passage from the to start.

106
00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:51.285
I'm, I'm okay, I'm setting up.

107
00:06:51.565 --> 00:06:53.685
I thought you forgot setting up for the prayer.

108
00:06:55.065 --> 00:06:56.365
Let me just read this verse though.

109
00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:58.165
Out of the Quran that says, oh people

110
00:06:58.185 --> 00:06:59.285
of the book and that's us.

111
00:06:59.995 --> 00:07:03.845
Okay? That's Christians commit no excesses in your

112
00:07:04.085 --> 00:07:05.245
religion, nor say of Allah.

113
00:07:05.265 --> 00:07:07.485
But, but the truth. Christ Jesus, the son of Mary,

114
00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:10.325
was no more than a messenger of aah

115
00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:14.015
say not Trinity desist.

116
00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:15.975
It will be better for you.

117
00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:20.575
For Allah is one God glory Beto him far exalted as he

118
00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:21.815
above having a son.

119
00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:27.455
And from Ali's, uh, footnotes

120
00:07:27.795 --> 00:07:30.975
and his translation, he says, the doctrines of Trinity

121
00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:34.855
equality with Allah and sonship are repudiated

122
00:07:35.035 --> 00:07:36.135
as blasphemies.

123
00:07:37.345 --> 00:07:38.815
Allah is independent of all needs

124
00:07:38.815 --> 00:07:41.815
and has no need of a son to manage his affairs.

125
00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:48.155
Okay, so point number one is

126
00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:51.515
you may have heard that Christianity

127
00:07:51.935 --> 00:07:54.955
and Islam worship the same God.

128
00:07:58.815 --> 00:08:01.435
We don't believe that. And right here, we don't need

129
00:08:01.435 --> 00:08:05.355
to go any farther than what's up here on strength one God,

130
00:08:05.415 --> 00:08:07.155
the God of Islam goes out of his way

131
00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:08.635
to say he does not have a son.

132
00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:10.675
Mm-hmm. Christianity

133
00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:16.395
and our God really went out of his way to say that He does.

134
00:08:17.065 --> 00:08:19.595
Good point. Yeah. So we don't have to go any farther.

135
00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:21.475
We don't have to go into the moral codes

136
00:08:21.475 --> 00:08:26.225
and all this kind of stuff between the two religions to know

137
00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:27.625
that they are very, very different.

138
00:08:27.845 --> 00:08:30.705
And one of the clear separations is this idea

139
00:08:31.005 --> 00:08:32.105
of the trinity.

140
00:08:32.975 --> 00:08:36.785
Okay? Second point, as we remain on Islam,

141
00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:40.625
you've heard of the Dome of the Rock.

142
00:08:40.845 --> 00:08:41.865
Mm-hmm. Okay.

143
00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:46.225
Over on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, constructed by AB

144
00:08:46.685 --> 00:08:48.625
and 6 92 ad.

145
00:08:49.965 --> 00:08:51.705
Here's kind of the schematic of it.

146
00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:55.725
And all over this, at the pointer here,

147
00:08:58.535 --> 00:09:00.835
all over this, this is the only original part

148
00:09:00.855 --> 00:09:03.355
of ab Malik's construction we still have today.

149
00:09:03.495 --> 00:09:06.075
And that's this inner ambulatory in the center part

150
00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:08.455
inside the dome of the rock.

151
00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:11.175
And all over that in tile mosaics

152
00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:14.135
are inscriptions in Arabic.

153
00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:17.375
And right here on the eastern wall

154
00:09:17.755 --> 00:09:21.015
and the inside of the wall, we see basically

155
00:09:21.045 --> 00:09:24.295
that same verse, that same Quranic verse.

156
00:09:25.645 --> 00:09:29.295
Okay? And if we go a step farther, all

157
00:09:29.315 --> 00:09:33.615
of these yellow stars are inscriptions that would

158
00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:37.095
denounce the trinity.

159
00:09:38.805 --> 00:09:40.695
They all claim Allah.

160
00:09:40.915 --> 00:09:43.335
One, he has no partners, he has no associates.

161
00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:45.455
And Jesus was not his son.

162
00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:49.275
And he was only a messenger, only a prophet.

163
00:09:50.975 --> 00:09:54.875
So you wonder, they went through such great lengths

164
00:09:55.495 --> 00:10:00.235
in this building to be a polemic

165
00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:04.155
against the Trinity of all the things

166
00:10:04.155 --> 00:10:06.595
that they could write about their God.

167
00:10:07.105 --> 00:10:09.515
They chose to really spend a lot of energy on

168
00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:11.835
Dean Nelson the Trinity.

169
00:10:13.175 --> 00:10:16.475
So it's very, very important. Very, very important.

170
00:10:18.055 --> 00:10:21.755
So with that, we're gonna pray. Okay?

171
00:10:24.215 --> 00:10:25.995
Father, you are such a good guy.

172
00:10:27.525 --> 00:10:29.315
Thank you for revealing

173
00:10:29.975 --> 00:10:32.635
who you are in your scripture.

174
00:10:32.925 --> 00:10:34.835
Thank you that you have given that to us.

175
00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:37.835
Thank you that we have it in English in our

176
00:10:37.835 --> 00:10:39.635
own native tongue.

177
00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.395
It wasn't written that way, but we have it today.

178
00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:46.395
So we know the word of God and we know clearly what it says.

179
00:10:47.975 --> 00:10:50.715
And we know that you are a triune God.

180
00:10:52.725 --> 00:10:55.865
And Father, that that topic is so important.

181
00:10:55.935 --> 00:10:57.105
It's such a hot topic.

182
00:10:57.215 --> 00:10:59.105
It's a hot button, really in the world today

183
00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:02.145
that many people disagree with that.

184
00:11:03.325 --> 00:11:04.665
And so, father, I pray

185
00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:07.225
that you would just reveal your truth to us tonight.

186
00:11:07.385 --> 00:11:09.185
I pray that my words would be truthful.

187
00:11:10.105 --> 00:11:11.785
I pray that we would be edified.

188
00:11:13.185 --> 00:11:14.745
I pray that we would walk out today

189
00:11:14.745 --> 00:11:17.425
with just a better understanding, not just of an academic

190
00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:20.785
doctrine, although we want that too,

191
00:11:21.965 --> 00:11:23.745
but that we would walk away blessed

192
00:11:23.925 --> 00:11:26.225
and really just knowing you better

193
00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:29.685
and who you are just a little better when we leave

194
00:11:30.195 --> 00:11:31.285
than when we walked in.

195
00:11:32.265 --> 00:11:34.525
So Father, I pray that you'll be gracious to us

196
00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:35.845
and help us to do that tonight.

197
00:11:36.105 --> 00:11:39.565
We pray that you'll be glorified too. In Jesus name. Amen.

198
00:11:42.275 --> 00:11:44.405
Alright, so our outline tonight,

199
00:11:46.355 --> 00:11:47.685
because it's so important,

200
00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:49.645
we wanna make sure we have a solid definition.

201
00:11:49.645 --> 00:11:51.125
And we're gonna spend a lot of time on this.

202
00:11:51.195 --> 00:11:54.805
This will be, it'll feel like walking through mud,

203
00:11:57.815 --> 00:12:00.275
but sometimes we gotta walk through mud to get

204
00:12:00.335 --> 00:12:02.555
to the place that we want to go.

205
00:12:02.905 --> 00:12:06.155
Okay? So bear with this, it'll be a little technical.

206
00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:09.435
Then we'll get to the essentials of the doctrine,

207
00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.755
recognizing errors in the teaching on Trinity,

208
00:12:13.695 --> 00:12:17.035
and then the work of the Trinity in our lives tonight,

209
00:12:17.035 --> 00:12:19.195
because we wanna have some application, right?

210
00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:21.435
And we're gonna end up with David

211
00:12:21.495 --> 00:12:24.835
and he's gonna kind of bring us home with some questions,

212
00:12:25.135 --> 00:12:26.235
uh, that he's put together.

213
00:12:27.415 --> 00:12:28.835
So the definition,

214
00:12:28.895 --> 00:12:33.075
and we're gonna start with, we can,

215
00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:35.955
we can have a little analogy here that I, I kind

216
00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:37.315
of liken this as a,

217
00:12:38.485 --> 00:12:42.975
we're gonna tightrope over the Grand Canyon, Okay?

218
00:12:43.755 --> 00:12:45.415
How would we go about tightrope and

219
00:12:45.555 --> 00:12:48.935
or tightrope walking over the Grand Canyon?

220
00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:53.295
Um, very carefully. Very carefully, Victor. Yeah.

221
00:12:54.195 --> 00:12:56.175
But we want to have an idea of

222
00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:57.975
where we're headed first, right?

223
00:12:58.085 --> 00:13:01.015
It's almost like it's very common, right?

224
00:13:01.015 --> 00:13:02.535
So you don't get seasick air sick, right?

225
00:13:02.535 --> 00:13:06.535
You want to have a stable event that you can look at so

226
00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:09.335
that when we're rocking back and forth, we don't get sick.

227
00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:11.695
And I think tight roping, we want to, we want

228
00:13:11.695 --> 00:13:12.735
to see the other side.

229
00:13:12.795 --> 00:13:14.175
We don't want to get caught in the middle

230
00:13:14.195 --> 00:13:15.815
and start looking down, right?

231
00:13:16.635 --> 00:13:17.935
We want to see the other side.

232
00:13:17.935 --> 00:13:19.815
So we're gonna start by looking at the other side.

233
00:13:20.725 --> 00:13:24.255
Otherwise, I could never really enjoy myself.

234
00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:26.175
I could never give,

235
00:13:46.715 --> 00:13:47.855
is this a Samsung tv?

236
00:13:47.855 --> 00:13:48.855
Because

237
00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:55.475
That's not where we're going.

238
00:13:56.155 --> 00:13:57.335
No, this is not where we're going.

239
00:14:01.005 --> 00:14:03.335
Alright? I think it always takes twice

240
00:14:03.555 --> 00:14:04.575
before it connects.

241
00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:13.095
Here's where we're headed. We are headed towards

242
00:14:14.275 --> 00:14:16.255
our definition, which we're gonna go out

243
00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:17.255
of Wayne Broom's book.

244
00:14:19.005 --> 00:14:21.895
It's very, very, it's very, very good definition.

245
00:14:21.925 --> 00:14:24.015
It's very simple, okay?

246
00:14:24.015 --> 00:14:25.735
And I think we need to start with the simple.

247
00:14:25.895 --> 00:14:27.495
I know that we're headed towards the simple,

248
00:14:27.495 --> 00:14:28.575
because we're not gonna get

249
00:14:28.575 --> 00:14:29.775
into the simple here in a minute.

250
00:14:30.755 --> 00:14:34.015
It says, God eternally exists as three persons,

251
00:14:34.035 --> 00:14:35.535
father, son, and Holy Spirit.

252
00:14:35.635 --> 00:14:39.775
And each person is fully God. And there is one God.

253
00:14:43.035 --> 00:14:48.015
Simple, simple enough. We get that Maybe, maybe not.

254
00:14:50.235 --> 00:14:52.165
If you want a little, little bit more meat on the

255
00:14:52.165 --> 00:14:54.325
bone, we can stay modern.

256
00:14:54.385 --> 00:14:56.525
And here's Phoebe Orfield's, uh,

257
00:14:56.525 --> 00:14:58.325
definition from about a hundred years ago.

258
00:15:00.215 --> 00:15:03.325
There is only one or one only in true God,

259
00:15:03.345 --> 00:15:06.605
but in the unity of the Godhead, there are three co-eternal

260
00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:10.245
and co-equal persons the same and substance,

261
00:15:11.105 --> 00:15:13.485
but distinct in subsistence.

262
00:15:15.635 --> 00:15:17.805
Okay? You see that's basically Broome

263
00:15:17.805 --> 00:15:20.245
with a little bit more hump to it.

264
00:15:21.305 --> 00:15:24.405
And we don't have to understand all these words perfectly.

265
00:15:24.405 --> 00:15:26.565
We're gonna get to that. Okay?

266
00:15:28.485 --> 00:15:31.085
Needless to say, when we're on this tightrope,

267
00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:34.965
it's gonna be easy for it to start swaying back and forth.

268
00:15:34.985 --> 00:15:36.005
And we want to make sure

269
00:15:36.795 --> 00:15:39.045
that we're always looking straight ahead.

270
00:15:39.045 --> 00:15:42.365
This is where we're going. Just remember Bruno's definition

271
00:15:42.365 --> 00:15:44.205
that we're gonna go back and we're gonna actually build

272
00:15:44.205 --> 00:15:45.485
through church history,

273
00:15:47.625 --> 00:15:49.205
our understanding of the Trinity.

274
00:15:49.595 --> 00:15:52.125
Okay? Before we start going into what does the Bible say?

275
00:15:52.525 --> 00:15:55.045
'cause what does, what does the Bible say about the trinity?

276
00:15:55.775 --> 00:15:58.885
Where is the verse that talks about the Trinity?

277
00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:03.965
Genesis one, one. Who say it? Anybody have one? Genesis one.

278
00:16:03.985 --> 00:16:07.805
One it The word trinity.

279
00:16:08.465 --> 00:16:11.445
Oh, the word trinity. No word. Sorry. Okay.

280
00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:12.925
I think I might know where you're

281
00:16:12.925 --> 00:16:14.125
headed and we can get there.

282
00:16:14.185 --> 00:16:15.205
And as Christians,

283
00:16:15.415 --> 00:16:19.805
we've pretty much exhausted all the things we can get out

284
00:16:19.805 --> 00:16:21.205
of the scripts are about the trinity,

285
00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:25.365
but the word trinity itself, like David said, is nowhere.

286
00:16:26.705 --> 00:16:31.165
So it's amazing that we have a definition

287
00:16:31.165 --> 00:16:33.925
of the trinity without one being given

288
00:16:34.105 --> 00:16:36.045
to us in the scriptures.

289
00:16:36.475 --> 00:16:38.245
Okay? So think about that too.

290
00:16:38.245 --> 00:16:40.045
Keep that in the back of your, your heads.

291
00:16:41.105 --> 00:16:42.485
So we're gonna go back to the beginning.

292
00:16:43.705 --> 00:16:45.885
And the very first church father

293
00:16:45.985 --> 00:16:50.805
who mentions the word trinity, is this guy named Ian.

294
00:16:51.545 --> 00:16:52.565
You may have heard of him.

295
00:16:53.465 --> 00:16:55.725
Uh, he was, uh, head

296
00:16:55.725 --> 00:16:58.045
of the church in a town called Carthage.

297
00:16:58.115 --> 00:17:01.365
It's in modern day Tunisia, okay? In North Africa.

298
00:17:02.785 --> 00:17:04.445
And here's a little bit about what he says.

299
00:17:04.505 --> 00:17:06.725
He wrote in Latin, uh, people on the west side

300
00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:09.165
of the church, early church spoke Latin from primarily.

301
00:17:09.585 --> 00:17:13.765
So all are, are of one by unity that is of substance.

302
00:17:13.765 --> 00:17:15.565
There's that key word substance, okay?

303
00:17:16.855 --> 00:17:19.245
Latin words are very beliefs. Yeah.

304
00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:25.525
And the unity into a Trinity Triose placing in

305
00:17:25.525 --> 00:17:29.685
that order, the three persons, which is the Latin persona,

306
00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.685
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

307
00:17:32.865 --> 00:17:36.125
So Ian really kind of nailed it here.

308
00:17:36.345 --> 00:17:39.445
And this is only about, well, it's about 180 years

309
00:17:39.535 --> 00:17:41.125
after the death of Christ.

310
00:17:41.835 --> 00:17:45.165
Okay? But you can look at that one of two ways.

311
00:17:45.345 --> 00:17:46.765
One, why did it take him so long?

312
00:17:47.705 --> 00:17:50.565
And the other one, how I look at it is, it's remarkable

313
00:17:50.635 --> 00:17:51.965
that, that early in the church,

314
00:17:51.965 --> 00:17:54.205
they had a definition of trinity.

315
00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:55.845
'cause it's not spelled out in scripture.

316
00:17:55.855 --> 00:17:58.405
These people have a mastery of the scripture enough

317
00:17:58.425 --> 00:18:01.805
to really understand who God is.

318
00:18:02.555 --> 00:18:04.845
Okay? To me, I think that's, that's pretty fascinating.

319
00:18:06.225 --> 00:18:09.285
Uh, but we see basically almost everything here in Groove's

320
00:18:09.285 --> 00:18:12.765
definition, way back in the year two 13, okay?

321
00:18:14.585 --> 00:18:17.085
The state of the Catholic church, uh, they,

322
00:18:17.085 --> 00:18:18.765
they were all in a Catholic church back then.

323
00:18:19.705 --> 00:18:21.045
That's kind of what they call the church.

324
00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:22.325
It was the church Catholic.

325
00:18:22.425 --> 00:18:24.525
We today have a different understanding of

326
00:18:24.525 --> 00:18:25.805
what the word Catholic means.

327
00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:27.525
It just means general, it's the general

328
00:18:27.585 --> 00:18:29.925
church back in those days.

329
00:18:30.305 --> 00:18:33.765
So they would all say they're part of the Catholic church.

330
00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:40.605
Okay? So the words pre naia, now we're gonna go to Naia

331
00:18:40.605 --> 00:18:45.485
and I have to say happy birthday to the Council

332
00:18:45.585 --> 00:18:48.885
of naia, which is back in 3 25 80.

333
00:18:49.065 --> 00:18:53.485
Did you know it's the 1700th birthday of the Council of Na?

334
00:18:53.845 --> 00:18:56.765
I bet you, I bet you don't knew that another, yeah, right?

335
00:18:57.385 --> 00:18:58.725
Oh, are they? Yeah. I didn't know that.

336
00:18:59.235 --> 00:19:01.685
Okay, so we are actually celebrating.

337
00:19:03.305 --> 00:19:06.245
So the Council of NAIA was called by Constantine,

338
00:19:07.785 --> 00:19:09.125
the upper of Rome.

339
00:19:09.745 --> 00:19:14.405
And they weren't necessarily concerned with the Trinity

340
00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:16.405
and discussing the doctrine of the Trinity.

341
00:19:16.465 --> 00:19:18.965
But what they were concerned about was the doctrine

342
00:19:18.965 --> 00:19:20.965
of Christ, who Christ is.

343
00:19:20.965 --> 00:19:23.245
That was a big controversy in the church at that time.

344
00:19:24.865 --> 00:19:27.285
And so it doesn't specifically talk about the Trinity,

345
00:19:27.545 --> 00:19:30.125
but we can glean information about the

346
00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:31.285
Trinity by what they said.

347
00:19:31.625 --> 00:19:34.165
So we believe in one God, the Father Almighty

348
00:19:34.705 --> 00:19:37.125
and is one Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God,

349
00:19:37.205 --> 00:19:39.605
begotten from the Father, only the God

350
00:19:39.795 --> 00:19:41.525
that is from the substance.

351
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:42.965
Okay? There's that word substance.

352
00:19:42.965 --> 00:19:46.165
Again, this was composed in Greek.

353
00:19:46.225 --> 00:19:49.085
So the Greek word there is cia. Okay? I've got up there.

354
00:19:51.705 --> 00:19:54.895
Jesus Christ, the same substance of the Father,

355
00:19:55.475 --> 00:19:59.055
God from God, light from light, true God from true God,

356
00:19:59.415 --> 00:20:02.095
begotten, not made of one substance.

357
00:20:02.115 --> 00:20:03.615
And now we tack on the prefix.

358
00:20:03.785 --> 00:20:08.255
Cuomo meaning the same Cuomo, Lucia meaning same substance.

359
00:20:09.765 --> 00:20:11.815
Okay? These were fighting words kind

360
00:20:11.815 --> 00:20:13.055
of in the early church, okay?

361
00:20:13.055 --> 00:20:15.015
There was a lot of divisiveness over this.

362
00:20:15.015 --> 00:20:17.575
There was a lot of collaboration in the council

363
00:20:18.275 --> 00:20:20.655
to really get to the bottom of who Jesus really is.

364
00:20:21.275 --> 00:20:25.135
And what they came up with was that Jesus is of the same

365
00:20:26.815 --> 00:20:29.455
substance as the Father.

366
00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:32.415
So we're getting to that point of

367
00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:36.055
how do you get three in one slowly

368
00:20:36.915 --> 00:20:38.415
but through time, okay?

369
00:20:38.415 --> 00:20:41.695
Through centuries of dialogue and study.

370
00:20:42.355 --> 00:20:45.415
Are, are we gonna get there? Okay.

371
00:20:45.415 --> 00:20:49.515
So that was the, but it's really

372
00:20:49.565 --> 00:20:53.035
after the Ian time that we really start

373
00:20:53.035 --> 00:20:56.115
to get into our modern definition of the Trinity.

374
00:20:56.775 --> 00:21:01.275
And it's these guys, the cap, ocean fathers cap, Doha,

375
00:21:01.275 --> 00:21:02.755
and I'll show you a map here in a couple slides.

376
00:21:04.455 --> 00:21:07.435
Cap, nice was in Turkey, modern day Turkey

377
00:21:07.815 --> 00:21:12.395
and just east of NAIA was a place called Cappadocia.

378
00:21:12.615 --> 00:21:16.195
And these three church leaders in Cappadocia

379
00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:19.435
really, um, paved the way

380
00:21:19.495 --> 00:21:21.555
for our modern understanding of the Trinity.

381
00:21:21.745 --> 00:21:23.515
Okay? So these cap ocean fathers,

382
00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:28.035
and I'll quote basal of Caesarea here in 3 73 ad

383
00:21:29.005 --> 00:21:31.595
we're therefore bound to confess the son to be

384
00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:32.715
of one substance.

385
00:21:32.745 --> 00:21:35.995
Okay? Here's that same language again of one substance.

386
00:21:36.015 --> 00:21:39.675
The homo, who's a Greek figure with the father

387
00:21:39.975 --> 00:21:43.715
as it's written notice he says as it's written,

388
00:21:45.935 --> 00:21:49.795
but the father to exist in his own proper person.

389
00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:54.555
And remember, Tulia used a Latin word persona,

390
00:21:54.615 --> 00:21:55.755
and that's where we still,

391
00:21:55.805 --> 00:21:59.755
after 1800 years now, use this word person okay?

392
00:21:59.775 --> 00:22:03.515
To define what Jesus is in relation

393
00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:05.075
to God, right?

394
00:22:06.735 --> 00:22:09.835
But in Greek, there's this word, prepost

395
00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:13.395
or hypostasis, okay, I've got up there.

396
00:22:14.515 --> 00:22:16.515
I gotta say that's probably my favorite Greek word.

397
00:22:17.895 --> 00:22:22.535
And for reasons of, it's just profound.

398
00:22:23.355 --> 00:22:24.735
If you were to study this word,

399
00:22:24.755 --> 00:22:28.335
and I've, I've tried my best to understand it.

400
00:22:29.235 --> 00:22:31.655
Uh, it is really rich, it's very philosophical

401
00:22:31.835 --> 00:22:33.135
and there's a lot of philosophy

402
00:22:33.135 --> 00:22:34.855
that we are discussing here, okay?

403
00:22:35.155 --> 00:22:39.935
Um, but what Basal had understood is

404
00:22:39.935 --> 00:22:41.055
that the father

405
00:22:41.275 --> 00:22:45.815
and the son exist thereof one substance,

406
00:22:45.815 --> 00:22:48.735
but they exist in their own individual

407
00:22:50.955 --> 00:22:54.465
hypostasis or hypostasis, okay?

408
00:22:55.335 --> 00:22:59.025
That we're gonna, this, this little, this is deep mud

409
00:22:59.255 --> 00:23:01.705
that we're dredging through, okay?

410
00:23:01.705 --> 00:23:03.705
That this will, this will start to kind of,

411
00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:06.345
will digest it thoroughly as we go.

412
00:23:08.255 --> 00:23:11.425
Okay? He exists in his own proper person, the son and his

413
00:23:11.425 --> 00:23:12.625
and the Holy Ghost and his,

414
00:23:12.805 --> 00:23:15.985
as they themselves have clearly delivered the doctrine.

415
00:23:17.955 --> 00:23:22.135
I'm glad Basal thinks it's clear. Do you think it's clear?

416
00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:26.375
Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I adjustment.

417
00:23:27.045 --> 00:23:28.695
Yeah. And that's what basal was doing.

418
00:23:28.885 --> 00:23:31.935
It's just screams at you. It does, it does.

419
00:23:33.405 --> 00:23:35.815
What I think we need to do and what's missing

420
00:23:35.875 --> 00:23:39.175
and why not everybody can say that, is we have

421
00:23:39.175 --> 00:23:41.215
to tune our ears to that frequency.

422
00:23:42.435 --> 00:23:46.805
And that is, that is, um, that comes with maturity,

423
00:23:47.235 --> 00:23:49.165
that comes with prayer, that comes

424
00:23:49.165 --> 00:23:50.845
with seeking the Holy Spirit

425
00:23:51.065 --> 00:23:54.805
and asking him to illuminate these truths to us

426
00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:58.005
that aren't necessarily spelled out in the black and white.

427
00:23:59.625 --> 00:24:01.685
But basal at this time was saying it's clear,

428
00:24:02.155 --> 00:24:03.405
it's clearly delivered.

429
00:24:03.905 --> 00:24:08.645
And he thought of this as God is of one, what

430
00:24:10.525 --> 00:24:13.445
substance and three, what

431
00:24:14.435 --> 00:24:17.085
persons So hypostasis, okay,

432
00:24:19.665 --> 00:24:24.005
he goes on because it's not all clear maybe

433
00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:25.125
what these words are.

434
00:24:25.345 --> 00:24:26.805
So he even actually defines these

435
00:24:26.805 --> 00:24:27.925
words a couple years later.

436
00:24:27.945 --> 00:24:29.885
He says the distinction between Lucia

437
00:24:29.985 --> 00:24:32.725
and Hypostasis is the same as that

438
00:24:32.725 --> 00:24:35.785
between the general and the particular.

439
00:24:37.445 --> 00:24:38.465
And we come back to that.

440
00:24:39.405 --> 00:24:42.225
In the case of the Godhead, we confess one essence

441
00:24:42.365 --> 00:24:45.825
or substance, so as to not give a varying definition

442
00:24:45.825 --> 00:24:49.385
of existence, but we confess a particular hypostasis in

443
00:24:49.385 --> 00:24:51.865
order that our conception of the father, son,

444
00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:54.865
and Holy Spirit may be without confusion

445
00:24:55.565 --> 00:24:57.705
and Clear.

446
00:24:59.845 --> 00:25:02.825
His goal was to make it clear

447
00:25:03.605 --> 00:25:04.905
for the people, for us.

448
00:25:06.415 --> 00:25:08.905
Okay? So now this distinction between Lucia

449
00:25:09.085 --> 00:25:10.825
and Hypostasis, the general

450
00:25:10.965 --> 00:25:15.185
and the particular, what does that mean, if you will

451
00:25:17.115 --> 00:25:19.305
think of a human?

452
00:25:20.535 --> 00:25:23.185
Okay. You can even just close your eyes, just think

453
00:25:23.185 --> 00:25:24.945
of a human, okay?

454
00:25:26.575 --> 00:25:28.065
Give you 20 seconds,

455
00:25:42.815 --> 00:25:43.815
Okay? Now

456
00:25:43.815 --> 00:25:48.305
open your eyes and here I am.

457
00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:53.425
What you, what you were thinking of.

458
00:25:53.455 --> 00:25:54.465
What were you thinking of?

459
00:25:55.175 --> 00:25:57.625
What, what thoughts came to your mind when you did that?

460
00:25:58.015 --> 00:25:59.345
Because this was a technique

461
00:25:59.345 --> 00:26:02.625
that the early church actually used to think

462
00:26:02.625 --> 00:26:03.665
between these two terms.

463
00:26:03.815 --> 00:26:07.345
What, what did you think of when you thought of human?

464
00:26:10.175 --> 00:26:14.025
Okay, but what she is a human, I'm sure,

465
00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:16.025
but like what about,

466
00:26:16.805 --> 00:26:19.065
I'm just talking about the nature of a human.

467
00:26:19.455 --> 00:26:23.225
Like what is it that you think of? Physical body. A human.

468
00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:25.985
Physical body. Okay, what else?

469
00:26:30.045 --> 00:26:31.905
Spirit and soul. Spirit and soul.

470
00:26:31.905 --> 00:26:36.225
There's an inside, inner, immaterial part to the human.

471
00:26:38.095 --> 00:26:39.815
Anything else? Anything. Maybe a part of that,

472
00:26:40.555 --> 00:26:41.555
Of the mind.

473
00:26:43.025 --> 00:26:44.245
Reason. Reason.

474
00:26:45.705 --> 00:26:49.685
So we have, uh, emotion maybe as well

475
00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.485
part of that, part of the soul.

476
00:26:53.605 --> 00:26:57.085
A volition a will we can desire. We can will things.

477
00:26:57.615 --> 00:27:01.085
Conscience. Conscience, yeah. Okay.

478
00:27:02.145 --> 00:27:05.245
So when I said here I am,

479
00:27:06.465 --> 00:27:09.485
it may not have been exactly what you were thinking of

480
00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:12.405
because you were thinking of the general, what is a human,

481
00:27:12.595 --> 00:27:15.325
what things specifically are characterizing a human?

482
00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:18.245
I am an example of one.

483
00:27:18.245 --> 00:27:21.125
I promise, but

484
00:27:21.705 --> 00:27:23.765
so are you or so are you.

485
00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:26.685
Okay? So that's what he's talking about, the general

486
00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:30.085
and the particular, I am a particular human.

487
00:27:30.895 --> 00:27:32.125
Human is the general.

488
00:27:32.345 --> 00:27:33.525
So now when we think about the

489
00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:34.565
Godhead, what's he talking about?

490
00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:40.765
This distinction is between God and the nature of God

491
00:27:42.075 --> 00:27:43.495
and Father, son

492
00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:47.775
and Holy Spirit are the particular, okay.

493
00:27:47.955 --> 00:27:49.255
So do you see that difference?

494
00:27:49.255 --> 00:27:51.775
Do you see the difference between the general, which is God

495
00:27:52.195 --> 00:27:56.215
and the particular, which are the three persons of the God?

496
00:27:57.435 --> 00:28:01.815
Is that clear? Okay. It's mud.

497
00:28:02.505 --> 00:28:05.655
Thank you, David. So now to kind

498
00:28:05.655 --> 00:28:09.535
of summarize this teaching is usia refers to what God is one

499
00:28:09.595 --> 00:28:12.235
of, and hypostasis

500
00:28:12.335 --> 00:28:15.435
or a person refers to what God is three of.

501
00:28:15.745 --> 00:28:19.915
Okay? That's a, that's I think a good way to understand

502
00:28:19.915 --> 00:28:21.195
between this one

503
00:28:21.195 --> 00:28:23.155
and three, which we're getting back to your point earlier,

504
00:28:24.895 --> 00:28:26.675
uh, of what we clearly understand,

505
00:28:26.775 --> 00:28:28.715
but most of the rest of the world does not.

506
00:28:30.545 --> 00:28:35.515
Okay? And then our friend Augustine, uh,

507
00:28:35.725 --> 00:28:40.075
after that 400, he sums it up with this tongue twister here.

508
00:28:40.075 --> 00:28:42.675
The Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit intimate a divine

509
00:28:42.875 --> 00:28:44.875
unity of one and the same substance.

510
00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:49.205
He was a Latin speaker in an indivisible equality, and

511
00:28:49.205 --> 00:28:52.085
therefore that they are not three gods, but one God,

512
00:28:52.445 --> 00:28:54.285
although the father have begotten the son.

513
00:28:54.425 --> 00:28:57.085
And so he who is the father is not the son,

514
00:28:57.585 --> 00:28:59.445
and the son is begotten by the Father.

515
00:28:59.545 --> 00:29:01.925
And so he who is the son is not the father.

516
00:29:02.465 --> 00:29:04.845
And the Holy Spirit is neither the father nor the son,

517
00:29:04.985 --> 00:29:06.565
but only the spirit of the Father

518
00:29:06.585 --> 00:29:09.125
and of the son himself, also co people with the father

519
00:29:09.185 --> 00:29:11.605
and the son partake to the unity of the Trinity.

520
00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:17.705
And now it's crystal clear, right?

521
00:29:20.005 --> 00:29:22.305
He has a way, he has a way of speaking to

522
00:29:22.305 --> 00:29:25.025
where he's summarizing all of this doctrine

523
00:29:25.025 --> 00:29:28.705
that we've built up now over 200 years into one

524
00:29:29.515 --> 00:29:33.935
digestible paragraph.

525
00:29:35.085 --> 00:29:37.055
Okay? So now let's look at this on map

526
00:29:37.795 --> 00:29:40.095
and let's go back to ion's right here in cartridge.

527
00:29:40.095 --> 00:29:43.325
Okay, here two 13, he's writing about the Trinity.

528
00:29:43.425 --> 00:29:44.565
We didn't discuss origin,

529
00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:49.885
but he's over here in the Nile Delta in Alexandria,

530
00:29:50.025 --> 00:29:52.725
in Northern Egypt, about that same time.

531
00:29:52.785 --> 00:29:55.845
But he's also, he also came up with something very similar

532
00:29:55.945 --> 00:29:57.925
to Ian regarding the Trinity.

533
00:29:59.265 --> 00:30:02.435
Here is the council Ofia in 3 25,

534
00:30:02.695 --> 00:30:05.195
the cap Ocean fathers 3 75,

535
00:30:05.775 --> 00:30:08.035
and then finishing up with Augustine and 400.

536
00:30:08.035 --> 00:30:09.835
What do you notice about this map pattern?

537
00:30:13.385 --> 00:30:14.995
It's all over the place, isn't it?

538
00:30:17.825 --> 00:30:21.915
They didn't have smartphones, they didn't have, uh, texts.

539
00:30:21.975 --> 00:30:24.155
Origin was not texting tulia.

540
00:30:24.255 --> 00:30:26.315
Hey, uh, buddy, what are you thinking about the Trinity?

541
00:30:28.025 --> 00:30:31.355
Yeah, it was hard to get around

542
00:30:31.895 --> 00:30:35.155
and you had to have something physical as far

543
00:30:35.155 --> 00:30:37.795
as a correspondence to be able to communicate.

544
00:30:37.895 --> 00:30:40.195
So think about how difficult it would be

545
00:30:41.975 --> 00:30:45.475
to have consistent doctrine in this early church with

546
00:30:45.505 --> 00:30:47.755
that basically is your playground.

547
00:30:49.435 --> 00:30:51.535
You have base that I, I mean that's,

548
00:30:51.535 --> 00:30:53.255
that's very similar to the size of us.

549
00:30:54.035 --> 00:30:55.775
So think about it.

550
00:30:56.005 --> 00:30:58.695
This is out here happening in Arizona, up here in New York.

551
00:31:00.405 --> 00:31:01.575
They're discussing this.

552
00:31:01.915 --> 00:31:06.175
It just helps us appreciate how this may have taken a couple

553
00:31:06.195 --> 00:31:09.535
of centuries even really to get hammered out.

554
00:31:10.165 --> 00:31:11.095
Okay? Does that make sense?

555
00:31:17.805 --> 00:31:19.455
Okay, how are we doing with the typo?

556
00:31:19.875 --> 00:31:21.615
We see where we're going. Are we in the middle

557
00:31:21.615 --> 00:31:24.135
of the Grand Canyon kind of wobbling and shaking right now?

558
00:31:24.155 --> 00:31:27.175
Are we looking down? Are we good on the definition?

559
00:31:27.195 --> 00:31:28.215
Is there anything we want to go

560
00:31:28.215 --> 00:31:30.215
over again with the definition? Is anything not

561
00:31:31.065 --> 00:31:32.065
Clear?

562
00:31:33.535 --> 00:31:35.975
Remember we're building something over two centuries

563
00:31:37.715 --> 00:31:39.175
to get to where we want to go.

564
00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:41.175
Okay? Does anybody happen?

565
00:31:41.425 --> 00:31:43.855
Maybe this is for related hypo and stasis.

566
00:31:43.875 --> 00:31:46.975
Is that a compound word that means something independent?

567
00:31:47.895 --> 00:31:50.655
I don't know. And I agree to know. I'm glad asked it.

568
00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:53.815
I I really want to talk an hour on this, but,

569
00:31:53.955 --> 00:31:58.335
but I'm not, I can't, yes, it's compound word hubo

570
00:31:58.635 --> 00:32:00.855
or hypo means under

571
00:32:01.915 --> 00:32:04.015
and stasis means stand.

572
00:32:04.995 --> 00:32:06.735
So if you think of our word understanding,

573
00:32:08.765 --> 00:32:13.495
what does understanding mean in its etymology?

574
00:32:13.605 --> 00:32:16.775
What does understand mean? It's, it's a weird word.

575
00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:19.815
We kind of know how we use it, but what does it mean?

576
00:32:19.815 --> 00:32:21.055
It means to stand under

577
00:32:21.715 --> 00:32:24.495
and grasp something that's above you, that means to hold up

578
00:32:24.495 --> 00:32:26.735
and understand what is

579
00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:30.635
Being discussed right now.

580
00:32:31.495 --> 00:32:34.715
So when you apply it to this in a hypostasis, you know,

581
00:32:34.715 --> 00:32:35.915
what does that have to do with?

582
00:32:36.735 --> 00:32:38.075
Um, God,

583
00:32:39.105 --> 00:32:42.765
it actually does mean something philosophically that

584
00:32:44.335 --> 00:32:48.285
Jesus as a hypostasis of God

585
00:32:49.345 --> 00:32:52.725
is the reality in our view of what God is.

586
00:32:53.585 --> 00:32:55.885
So, and Jesus even says it himself.

587
00:32:56.105 --> 00:32:59.605
He who has seen me has seen a father.

588
00:33:00.585 --> 00:33:04.205
So he is the visible image of the invisible God.

589
00:33:04.355 --> 00:33:05.405
Paul says that too.

590
00:33:06.145 --> 00:33:09.005
So that's exactly what that word hypostasis means.

591
00:33:09.145 --> 00:33:12.165
It means a manifested reality

592
00:33:12.385 --> 00:33:15.125
and understanding of what God is.

593
00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:17.045
So when people saw Jesus,

594
00:33:17.185 --> 00:33:21.435
if he walked in the room right now, we could say

595
00:33:22.425 --> 00:33:26.225
there's everything God is right there.

596
00:33:26.975 --> 00:33:31.625
That would be, he would be our manifested reality of

597
00:33:32.165 --> 00:33:34.985
who God is when he walks in his door.

598
00:33:35.445 --> 00:33:38.505
So it's a very rich philosophical term that we can go

599
00:33:38.505 --> 00:33:41.385
with a lot more, but that's really the root of

600
00:33:41.385 --> 00:33:44.065
what the word means as we break it down.

601
00:33:44.215 --> 00:33:45.705
Yeah, that's a great question.

602
00:33:46.785 --> 00:33:50.865
Anything else before we go on to talk about the essentials?

603
00:33:52.275 --> 00:33:54.385
We're back to ham's definition now.

604
00:33:54.405 --> 00:33:57.345
So we, I think we got past the deepest part of the canyon,

605
00:33:58.125 --> 00:34:02.905
if you're still hanging in there. Yeah,

606
00:34:03.505 --> 00:34:07.665
I, uh, that is a rich word and it's, it's deep

607
00:34:07.665 --> 00:34:10.465
and it just makes me think of belief

608
00:34:11.725 --> 00:34:16.545
to eliminate the Son who is the hypo

609
00:34:18.245 --> 00:34:20.785
stasis of God, of God, our understanding

610
00:34:20.805 --> 00:34:22.345
of God. And they have,

611
00:34:22.885 --> 00:34:23.885
And they have done Of that.

612
00:34:24.125 --> 00:34:25.125
And that's just

613
00:34:26.525 --> 00:34:31.305
If, if without Jesus it says

614
00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:34.665
He is the image, the visible image of the invisible God.

615
00:34:34.665 --> 00:34:35.985
You take Jesus out of the picture.

616
00:34:36.085 --> 00:34:38.345
You just had an invisible God. Yeah.

617
00:34:40.375 --> 00:34:43.785
What do you do with that? You do with that

618
00:34:44.655 --> 00:34:46.625
what humanity did until Jesus came

619
00:34:47.245 --> 00:34:50.065
and revealed who God is.

620
00:34:50.065 --> 00:34:53.345
This is why it is critical that God has a son.

621
00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:56.825
And you can't go post enough signs

622
00:34:56.885 --> 00:34:58.865
to say Jesus is not the son of God.

623
00:34:58.865 --> 00:35:01.305
Because without that, what we have

624
00:35:03.825 --> 00:35:06.185
anything to stand under, right?

625
00:35:07.725 --> 00:35:11.465
So let's go to the, the, the, the definition of wing Bruno,

626
00:35:11.525 --> 00:35:13.345
I'm gonna twist it 'cause I think you might have

627
00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:15.545
gotten a little bit backwards.

628
00:35:15.885 --> 00:35:17.945
Not, not that it's bad, but I'm gonna start with the end

629
00:35:17.945 --> 00:35:19.385
of his definition of work forward.

630
00:35:19.975 --> 00:35:22.225
There's one God, this is essential today.

631
00:35:22.415 --> 00:35:25.865
This is essential number one, that there is one God.

632
00:35:27.515 --> 00:35:28.775
So what does the scripture say?

633
00:35:30.325 --> 00:35:33.935
Well, Isaiah 43 10 says Before me, no God was formed,

634
00:35:34.235 --> 00:35:35.975
nor shall there be any after me.

635
00:35:36.655 --> 00:35:39.205
I am Yahweh. There is no other God besides me.

636
00:35:39.205 --> 00:35:40.285
There is no other God.

637
00:35:43.335 --> 00:35:45.795
And if you want other passages, there's a few. Yeah.

638
00:35:46.375 --> 00:35:47.675
Um, right.

639
00:35:47.795 --> 00:35:52.275
I I don't think we need to harp on this too much of

640
00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:54.355
what the scripture says about there's only one God,

641
00:35:54.415 --> 00:35:56.595
but God himself is one

642
00:35:58.195 --> 00:36:01.515
a slightly different twist on the same thing.

643
00:36:02.255 --> 00:36:06.355
The Shama hero, Israel, Yahweh, our God, Yahweh is one

644
00:36:07.335 --> 00:36:09.755
you shall love Yahweh, your God with all your heart

645
00:36:10.015 --> 00:36:12.115
and with all your soul and with all your might.

646
00:36:13.055 --> 00:36:16.035
So there's one God and he himself is one.

647
00:36:16.175 --> 00:36:17.715
So we're getting a lot of ones here.

648
00:36:18.425 --> 00:36:22.005
Doesn't mean that God is one. I know what it means.

649
00:36:22.005 --> 00:36:24.085
That there's only one God that's monotheism.

650
00:36:24.235 --> 00:36:27.405
What does it mean when it says God is one though

651
00:36:28.555 --> 00:36:29.555
Unified?

652
00:36:30.195 --> 00:36:31.365
Unified there has to there.

653
00:36:31.585 --> 00:36:35.645
So unified means that there's something to unify, right?

654
00:36:35.905 --> 00:36:38.805
Yes. So you go back to the scriptures again,

655
00:36:38.805 --> 00:36:39.965
even the Old Testament

656
00:36:41.545 --> 00:36:43.685
and I, I don't know if it's screaming,

657
00:36:43.945 --> 00:36:46.045
but it's hinting it, it's hinting.

658
00:36:46.475 --> 00:36:49.645
It's, it's, it's, it's disgusting it, right?

659
00:36:49.755 --> 00:36:50.805
It's not hiding it.

660
00:36:51.635 --> 00:36:53.005
Some gonna say maybe it is,

661
00:36:53.105 --> 00:36:56.965
but it's there for the ones who as adhere

662
00:36:56.985 --> 00:37:00.005
to here what's being said.

663
00:37:01.025 --> 00:37:03.245
And Jesus himself affirms this in Mark.

664
00:37:04.505 --> 00:37:07.645
So now we have our graphic, which is the other handout here,

665
00:37:09.265 --> 00:37:11.165
and there's a lot on that graphic

666
00:37:11.265 --> 00:37:13.485
and that's really something for you guys just to take

667
00:37:13.485 --> 00:37:16.885
with you and digest it at your leisure.

668
00:37:17.505 --> 00:37:18.765
But we're gonna actually build

669
00:37:18.765 --> 00:37:20.765
that graphic here on the screen.

670
00:37:20.865 --> 00:37:24.605
So I'm glad you're all sitting. Here's how we start.

671
00:37:26.415 --> 00:37:27.925
There is one God,

672
00:37:29.185 --> 00:37:33.765
and that's gonna be the blue circle in the middle, okay?

673
00:37:34.425 --> 00:37:37.565
Now we're gonna go on to the central number two, uh,

674
00:37:37.585 --> 00:37:42.565
before we do the five Solas, if you've heard

675
00:37:42.565 --> 00:37:45.445
that of reformed theology, which is fairly recently,

676
00:37:45.445 --> 00:37:47.045
church history speak.

677
00:37:47.945 --> 00:37:52.405
Um, number five is this concept of so Deo Gloria,

678
00:37:53.495 --> 00:37:56.205
which means to the glory of God alone.

679
00:37:57.265 --> 00:38:01.325
So not only is he one God, he says, I am Yahweh

680
00:38:01.325 --> 00:38:02.485
and that is my name and my glory.

681
00:38:02.605 --> 00:38:04.885
I gift it no other, okay?

682
00:38:07.075 --> 00:38:09.325
Amen on that. We're we're good on that.

683
00:38:09.825 --> 00:38:13.965
The problem is, um, Jesus says this,

684
00:38:14.145 --> 00:38:18.005
and now Father glorify me in your own presence

685
00:38:18.005 --> 00:38:22.705
with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.

686
00:38:31.065 --> 00:38:34.765
See any, uh, problems with that verse? The only problem

687
00:38:34.865 --> 00:38:39.365
Is if you saw it as, uh, God as more than one God.

688
00:38:40.125 --> 00:38:42.945
Uh, if you look at it from the verse, you look at it as

689
00:38:43.805 --> 00:38:46.345
two persons and one God,

690
00:38:46.735 --> 00:38:48.545
then it under then it's understanding.

691
00:38:49.095 --> 00:38:52.945
Yeah. But do you see how the religious leaders

692
00:38:52.965 --> 00:38:55.585
of the day wanted to throw stones at him

693
00:38:56.565 --> 00:38:58.545
on face value is so humble.

694
00:38:58.975 --> 00:39:00.265
It's completely glassless.

695
00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:05.145
If you look at this at face value, yes, I know

696
00:39:05.145 --> 00:39:09.105
where you're going and you're correct, but at face value

697
00:39:09.205 --> 00:39:10.625
and at this part in our definition

698
00:39:10.645 --> 00:39:14.065
and our, our dredging through bud to understand the trinity,

699
00:39:15.335 --> 00:39:17.345
that seems to blatantly contradict that.

700
00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:21.065
But we know it doesn't. So hang in there.

701
00:39:22.125 --> 00:39:27.025
The remedy, the cure for this is essential number two.

702
00:39:28.285 --> 00:39:32.185
And that is that God is three persons.

703
00:39:37.725 --> 00:39:38.785
We see that in the scripture.

704
00:39:40.325 --> 00:39:43.305
We can go back and we can look at how, uh,

705
00:39:43.455 --> 00:39:45.985
hold back the beginning creation.

706
00:39:47.605 --> 00:39:49.625
We brought up Genesis, right?

707
00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:53.665
Genesis 1 26 says, then God said,

708
00:39:53.765 --> 00:39:56.705
let us make man in our image, choose the us.

709
00:39:59.405 --> 00:40:00.705
We have a couple of options.

710
00:40:01.855 --> 00:40:05.385
None of 'em are good except the one we all know and love.

711
00:40:05.405 --> 00:40:09.225
And that's Trinity. The other ones would be multiple guys,

712
00:40:11.525 --> 00:40:13.225
angels hanging out with God.

713
00:40:14.605 --> 00:40:16.705
Uh, but they don't create things, right?

714
00:40:17.085 --> 00:40:19.625
Unless you understand verse one and two and two,

715
00:40:20.725 --> 00:40:21.725
One and two. Verse one,

716
00:40:21.725 --> 00:40:24.145
two, yeah, well, yeah, it's building up, right?

717
00:40:24.295 --> 00:40:25.625
This is not just, I pulled that

718
00:40:25.625 --> 00:40:27.185
of context, but without that.

719
00:40:29.515 --> 00:40:30.735
But now let's go through the Trinity.

720
00:40:30.765 --> 00:40:33.815
Have we not all one father and is not one God created us.

721
00:40:33.845 --> 00:40:36.175
Malachi says the Father creates, right?

722
00:40:37.845 --> 00:40:41.135
Paul says Jesus Christ, through whom we exist,

723
00:40:42.165 --> 00:40:44.455
Paul says that Jesus creates,

724
00:40:46.475 --> 00:40:49.215
Joe says, the Spirit of God made me.

725
00:40:51.845 --> 00:40:55.185
So we have the Trinity as we peruse all of scripture, right?

726
00:40:55.285 --> 00:40:56.745
And, and we talked about it.

727
00:40:56.745 --> 00:40:59.145
The verse isn't there, the one verse,

728
00:40:59.245 --> 00:41:00.665
the the gotcha verse isn't there,

729
00:41:00.885 --> 00:41:03.385
but we don't read just one verse.

730
00:41:03.445 --> 00:41:04.505
We read the whole book.

731
00:41:05.325 --> 00:41:09.145
And the whole book, I agree screams Trinity.

732
00:41:09.685 --> 00:41:13.265
So we can see that creation, we see salvation.

733
00:41:13.325 --> 00:41:15.105
How much more will the blood of Christ to,

734
00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:18.465
through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish

735
00:41:18.465 --> 00:41:22.145
to God, purify our conscience from the dead, from dead words

736
00:41:22.405 --> 00:41:23.825
to serve the live in God.

737
00:41:24.375 --> 00:41:25.745
Okay? We see him at work,

738
00:41:26.605 --> 00:41:30.985
the tri God at work in the Trinity, and very similar here.

739
00:41:30.985 --> 00:41:34.325
And Peter, I think we got our notes.

740
00:41:37.345 --> 00:41:40.325
One God, three in authority go therefore

741
00:41:40.325 --> 00:41:41.965
and make disciples of all nations,

742
00:41:41.965 --> 00:41:46.065
baptizing them in the name of which means what?

743
00:41:46.885 --> 00:41:50.625
In the authority of the Father of the Son

744
00:41:51.445 --> 00:41:56.065
and the Holy Spirit, And was declared

745
00:41:56.065 --> 00:41:59.545
to be the son of God in power according to the spirit

746
00:41:59.645 --> 00:42:02.465
of holiness by his resurrection from the dead,

747
00:42:02.475 --> 00:42:03.785
Jesus Christ, our Lord.

748
00:42:03.845 --> 00:42:06.465
So the very event of the resurrection,

749
00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:09.625
we all agree it's a very powerful event.

750
00:42:09.645 --> 00:42:12.865
But there were three at work in the resurrection.

751
00:42:13.355 --> 00:42:17.785
Jesus was just, it was the physical body that got raised,

752
00:42:17.925 --> 00:42:22.025
but it was the Holy Spirit through God the Father.

753
00:42:22.485 --> 00:42:24.865
And it was a, it was a team effort.

754
00:42:25.485 --> 00:42:28.345
It was not just God, it was God,

755
00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:32.545
but three in one God doing the resurrection, right?

756
00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:35.625
You see that expanding.

757
00:42:35.645 --> 00:42:38.105
Now our graphic with a central number two,

758
00:42:38.325 --> 00:42:41.945
and we've got these three persons out here.

759
00:42:42.775 --> 00:42:44.625
It's funny, I had, I had lunch with Joe Morrow

760
00:42:44.625 --> 00:42:45.985
and I, we talked about this

761
00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:48.265
and I told him, I, I made a graphic for this.

762
00:42:48.295 --> 00:42:49.545
He's like, did you make it a triangle?

763
00:42:52.375 --> 00:42:54.225
Like, yeah, spoil, spoiler. Alert. Alert.

764
00:42:55.125 --> 00:42:59.305
Um, but with Augustine's help, we can actually start

765
00:42:59.305 --> 00:43:02.795
to understand how these three are

766
00:43:03.755 --> 00:43:05.305
distinct, right?

767
00:43:05.365 --> 00:43:08.305
And his definition, he says the father is not the son.

768
00:43:09.405 --> 00:43:11.585
Son is not the father. The spirit is

769
00:43:11.585 --> 00:43:12.745
neither the father nor the son.

770
00:43:13.175 --> 00:43:16.425
Okay? So this is where we're at now with essential one

771
00:43:16.425 --> 00:43:17.665
and essential number two.

772
00:43:18.055 --> 00:43:19.545
What we've gotta do now is go to

773
00:43:19.545 --> 00:43:23.225
that essential number three, which is each of these persons

774
00:43:24.245 --> 00:43:26.345
is themselves distinctly fully

775
00:43:26.525 --> 00:43:29.385
God, Okay?

776
00:43:29.805 --> 00:43:31.385
The Father is God.

777
00:43:31.555 --> 00:43:32.705
We've seen Malachi,

778
00:43:33.325 --> 00:43:35.385
and I don't think we're gonna camp out here too long

779
00:43:35.385 --> 00:43:38.545
because I would say that this is probably the easiest part

780
00:43:38.545 --> 00:43:42.865
of the lesson is, and you could go outside of our faith

781
00:43:43.165 --> 00:43:45.585
and people would understand that the Father is God,

782
00:43:47.325 --> 00:43:49.105
but the Son is also God.

783
00:43:50.045 --> 00:43:51.065
And I won't read all this,

784
00:43:51.085 --> 00:43:53.385
but you know, John one, one in the beginning was the word,

785
00:43:53.405 --> 00:43:54.425
the word was with God.

786
00:43:54.425 --> 00:43:57.945
And the word was God. You skipped down to verse 14.

787
00:43:57.965 --> 00:44:00.505
And the word became flesh, okay?

788
00:44:00.505 --> 00:44:03.745
That's clearly, clearly talking about Jesus

789
00:44:04.125 --> 00:44:05.705
and his deity.

790
00:44:08.005 --> 00:44:10.225
He even claims that I'm the Father are one.

791
00:44:10.545 --> 00:44:12.385
Remember God, Yahweh is one.

792
00:44:13.355 --> 00:44:16.745
Jesus says the same thing, I'm the Father are one.

793
00:44:17.325 --> 00:44:20.065
So he's even getting himself into this oneness

794
00:44:21.605 --> 00:44:22.605
Of God.

795
00:44:24.295 --> 00:44:28.735
Paul tells Titus that Jesus is God.

796
00:44:29.885 --> 00:44:32.885
John says that he's the true God of eternal life.

797
00:44:34.265 --> 00:44:36.245
And we could put much more up there,

798
00:44:36.585 --> 00:44:39.445
but we haven't gotten to Christology yet in this series.

799
00:44:39.545 --> 00:44:40.605
We will next semester,

800
00:44:40.705 --> 00:44:43.605
but, uh, we gotta least touch on this.

801
00:44:45.585 --> 00:44:47.285
And here's the fundamentals, okay?

802
00:44:47.305 --> 00:44:51.725
And this is Hebrews is a very, very deep book.

803
00:44:52.825 --> 00:44:54.965
And the first four verses

804
00:44:54.965 --> 00:44:56.925
of Hebrews are probably the deepest part

805
00:44:56.925 --> 00:44:58.645
of the deep book of Hebrews.

806
00:44:59.345 --> 00:45:02.725
And in verse three, it says, he being Jesus,

807
00:45:03.465 --> 00:45:05.405
he is the radiance of the glory

808
00:45:05.405 --> 00:45:08.245
of God in the exact imprint of his nature.

809
00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:14.885
That Greek word is hypostasis.

810
00:45:17.285 --> 00:45:20.845
Remember what that means? Jesus is the

811
00:45:21.495 --> 00:45:25.845
exact representation of the reality

812
00:45:25.865 --> 00:45:30.005
of God are, like I said, when he walks through the door,

813
00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:35.045
when we see him, we see exactly everything

814
00:45:35.705 --> 00:45:37.805
God is in him.

815
00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:43.285
And it, it, ESV says nature.

816
00:45:43.725 --> 00:45:47.445
I, I have a slight philosophical issue with that,

817
00:45:47.445 --> 00:45:50.405
which I'm not gonna uh, pound the table on,

818
00:45:50.825 --> 00:45:53.685
but the new King James probably gets it right, I think

819
00:45:53.745 --> 00:45:56.845
or maybe a little bit more clear that says, uh,

820
00:45:56.955 --> 00:45:59.925
they actually use the word person there for hypostasis.

821
00:46:00.125 --> 00:46:01.165
'cause hypostasis, remember

822
00:46:01.165 --> 00:46:02.405
that is what God is the three of.

823
00:46:03.825 --> 00:46:08.485
So persons would be, I think philosophically the better

824
00:46:09.235 --> 00:46:10.925
term to actually use there.

825
00:46:13.025 --> 00:46:15.565
Um, Paul says, he breaks it down a little simpler here.

826
00:46:15.565 --> 00:46:17.125
He says, he's the image jumping

827
00:46:18.505 --> 00:46:20.805
and whoever has seen me has seen the Father.

828
00:46:22.195 --> 00:46:25.125
Okay? We kind of talked about that already.

829
00:46:27.065 --> 00:46:28.645
And the Holy Spirit is God,

830
00:46:29.145 --> 00:46:32.125
but member Acts five, Peter said, Ananias,

831
00:46:32.145 --> 00:46:34.765
why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit?

832
00:46:35.385 --> 00:46:36.525
You have not lied to man,

833
00:46:36.545 --> 00:46:40.005
but to you God, that he's clearly

834
00:46:40.845 --> 00:46:44.485
equating the Holy Spirit with God in that single sentence.

835
00:46:47.135 --> 00:46:49.285
These things, God has revealed us through the Spirit.

836
00:46:49.675 --> 00:46:52.765
Paul says in 20 years, for the spirit searches everything,

837
00:46:52.765 --> 00:46:54.765
even the depths of God for

838
00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:56.965
who knows the person's thoughts except the spirit of

839
00:46:56.965 --> 00:46:58.445
that person which is in him.

840
00:46:58.865 --> 00:47:02.205
So also no thoughts of God except the spirit of God.

841
00:47:02.205 --> 00:47:04.725
That's a very unique relationship between the Spirit

842
00:47:04.825 --> 00:47:09.765
and God, meaning that they are the same just as my spirit

843
00:47:09.865 --> 00:47:12.725
and me understand each other.

844
00:47:13.505 --> 00:47:16.965
So the Spirit and God are one and the same.

845
00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:21.205
Okay, back to the graphic, what do we do

846
00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:22.605
with this essential number three?

847
00:47:24.305 --> 00:47:28.325
Well, there's paths of each of them to

848
00:47:31.185 --> 00:47:36.165
The God, okay, this isn't perfect, this is as good

849
00:47:36.165 --> 00:47:38.405
as I could put together on PowerPoint.

850
00:47:39.865 --> 00:47:43.085
Um, I'm sure there's a better one,

851
00:47:44.865 --> 00:47:48.525
but this will, this will suffice I think right now.

852
00:47:48.625 --> 00:47:51.845
So this is kind of the basics of the graphic

853
00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:54.125
that you've got, which I filled in a bunch of verses

854
00:47:54.125 --> 00:47:55.445
and everything else that you can kind

855
00:47:55.445 --> 00:47:56.965
of go reference, don't believe me.

856
00:47:57.585 --> 00:48:00.045
Go look at these verses up, read 'em for yourselves,

857
00:48:00.685 --> 00:48:04.205
meditate on those and really truly seek what the meaning

858
00:48:04.225 --> 00:48:05.285
of trinity is.

859
00:48:06.265 --> 00:48:09.165
So that or in your understanding. So hey Dan, yeah.

860
00:48:10.905 --> 00:48:15.005
Review number two guys through person three blanks.

861
00:48:15.665 --> 00:48:16.925
The second one, one.

862
00:48:22.865 --> 00:48:23.085
So

863
00:48:23.145 --> 00:48:25.125
The mixed up on second And third.

864
00:48:25.285 --> 00:48:27.925
I, I did, I I switched the slides after I made the thing.

865
00:48:27.935 --> 00:48:29.965
Sorry. Um, yeah, it's creation.

866
00:48:30.745 --> 00:48:33.605
And then the next one on your handout would be authority.

867
00:48:33.905 --> 00:48:38.085
And then the next one is salvation, I believe. Sorry.

868
00:48:38.085 --> 00:48:41.925
Good catch. Alright, so now

869
00:48:41.925 --> 00:48:44.285
that we've got the essentials down, understand

870
00:48:44.285 --> 00:48:48.885
what the definition is of the, of the trinity, we ought

871
00:48:48.885 --> 00:48:51.845
to now understand what happens when one

872
00:48:51.845 --> 00:48:53.845
of those essentials gets tweaked a little bit.

873
00:48:53.915 --> 00:48:57.605
Okay? This is, this is the tightrope again and we the wall

874
00:48:58.225 --> 00:49:00.805
and we start to sway from one side to the next.

875
00:49:02.895 --> 00:49:04.725
Let's start with errors in this first

876
00:49:06.315 --> 00:49:07.805
that there is one God, okay?

877
00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:11.645
The opposite of monotheism would be polytheism, right?

878
00:49:11.665 --> 00:49:14.955
We talked about that. There's a definition of it up there.

879
00:49:14.955 --> 00:49:19.475
The belief in of for worship of more than one God

880
00:49:21.805 --> 00:49:26.075
about some examples, Hinduism, Buddhism,

881
00:49:26.785 --> 00:49:28.595
Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses,

882
00:49:28.935 --> 00:49:33.275
and nearly every ancient religion, uh,

883
00:49:33.275 --> 00:49:36.355
they were notorious for finding multiple things

884
00:49:36.375 --> 00:49:39.115
to worship in their world.

885
00:49:42.945 --> 00:49:47.115
Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, um, at the very root

886
00:49:47.135 --> 00:49:49.275
of it are, are polytheistic

887
00:49:49.975 --> 00:49:53.555
and their belief system, um, Jesus is a God.

888
00:49:54.545 --> 00:49:59.115
That means that other ones to including the Father.

889
00:49:59.895 --> 00:50:04.475
So multiple gods. That's a fairly easy one though.

890
00:50:05.315 --> 00:50:07.755
What about these other ones? So if there's errors in

891
00:50:08.025 --> 00:50:10.995
essential number two, then God is three persons.

892
00:50:12.225 --> 00:50:16.915
What happens here? Well, this, what we find is

893
00:50:16.915 --> 00:50:20.875
that people merge persons of the Trinity, they combine them

894
00:50:21.295 --> 00:50:24.995
or they omit one or more persons of the trinity.

895
00:50:25.175 --> 00:50:27.725
So if there's not three persons anymore,

896
00:50:29.475 --> 00:50:30.525
what are some examples?

897
00:50:32.605 --> 00:50:36.645
Modalism, if you've heard of that, that God offers, uh, uh,

898
00:50:36.745 --> 00:50:39.605
he, uh, he operates and, and,

899
00:50:39.865 --> 00:50:42.605
and modes like the Father does this, the son does

900
00:50:42.605 --> 00:50:43.925
that the Holy Spirit does that.

901
00:50:44.405 --> 00:50:48.445
Whatever the need is. That was a very early document.

902
00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:49.965
The church, Islam

903
00:50:49.965 --> 00:50:54.375
and Judaism, we might classify them

904
00:50:54.435 --> 00:50:56.015
as other religions or whatever,

905
00:50:56.075 --> 00:51:00.935
but at the root of it, they are, uh, the error is that

906
00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:04.535
they did not believe in free persons of God.

907
00:51:07.715 --> 00:51:10.295
And right here in our town of Evan,

908
00:51:10.355 --> 00:51:12.855
the Philadelphia church is God according to their website,

909
00:51:13.445 --> 00:51:14.735
they deny the person of dis

910
00:51:15.355 --> 00:51:18.935
or the the Holy Spirit that puts them in this.

911
00:51:22.555 --> 00:51:24.535
So these are just some examples.

912
00:51:26.555 --> 00:51:30.055
Um, yeah, the father is the son is the spirit.

913
00:51:30.205 --> 00:51:31.735
Okay, so we go back to the graphic.

914
00:51:32.435 --> 00:51:34.975
All those words that say is not you would just take the

915
00:51:34.985 --> 00:51:36.375
knots off and say is,

916
00:51:36.995 --> 00:51:39.455
and that's what this era would look like in the early

917
00:51:39.455 --> 00:51:42.255
church, especially when we talk about modalism,

918
00:51:42.405 --> 00:51:46.815
what modalism is. Yeah,

919
00:51:47.575 --> 00:51:49.335
Modalism is

920
00:51:49.335 --> 00:51:52.175
Another way of saying it, is that God might show up today

921
00:51:52.595 --> 00:51:56.095
as, or might be referred to today, reveal as father,

922
00:51:56.835 --> 00:51:58.615
but in another situation in a few more minutes,

923
00:51:58.625 --> 00:52:00.775
might be able to spirit like one at a time.

924
00:52:00.965 --> 00:52:02.175
Yeah, kind of a one at a time.

925
00:52:02.235 --> 00:52:04.295
As, as as more of a functional thing.

926
00:52:04.995 --> 00:52:08.615
So when, when God wants to do this, he does it as the son.

927
00:52:08.615 --> 00:52:10.935
When God wants to do this, he does it as the Holy Spirit

928
00:52:11.835 --> 00:52:13.095
as modes.

929
00:52:13.095 --> 00:52:15.735
There's different modes of operation within the God.

930
00:52:17.475 --> 00:52:19.335
For example one.

931
00:52:20.195 --> 00:52:24.375
Dan, would it be a stretch to say that a cessationist church

932
00:52:28.755 --> 00:52:32.255
Regard spiritual gifts Here no longer?

933
00:52:36.755 --> 00:52:38.315
I wouldn't, I wouldn't go that far.

934
00:52:39.395 --> 00:52:40.795
I think you can still believe

935
00:52:40.795 --> 00:52:43.795
that there the Holy Spirit is deity and part of the godhead

936
00:52:44.055 --> 00:52:47.875
and not believe he supplies certain gifts anymore.

937
00:52:48.545 --> 00:52:52.115
That wouldn't necessarily remove any godness?

938
00:52:53.795 --> 00:52:56.155
I wouldn't think so just off the top

939
00:52:56.155 --> 00:52:57.595
of my head I probably wouldn't do it that far.

940
00:53:00.535 --> 00:53:01.535
Was there another

941
00:53:02.195 --> 00:53:03.195
I got a question. Yeah,

942
00:53:03.195 --> 00:53:04.185

943
00:53:05.235 --> 00:53:07.555
I Had been thinking about this I guess after the last,

944
00:53:09.215 --> 00:53:11.995
and I was thinking that as a musical chord

945
00:53:13.925 --> 00:53:16.275
notes, so played the,

946
00:53:20.425 --> 00:53:22.275
like kids play.

947
00:53:25.045 --> 00:53:26.045
Do you think of that analogy?

948
00:53:30.525 --> 00:53:34.605
I I I you'll you'll notice I didn't put any analogies in

949
00:53:34.605 --> 00:53:36.605
this class because I all bad.

950
00:53:38.765 --> 00:53:40.205
I I I appreciate that.

951
00:53:40.365 --> 00:53:44.805
I appreciate the SUN analogy.

952
00:53:45.005 --> 00:53:48.685
I appreciate the ones that says I am multiple things.

953
00:53:48.905 --> 00:53:51.085
I'm a dad and a son at the same time,

954
00:53:52.585 --> 00:53:55.605
but I'm not, I operate in different modes.

955
00:53:56.885 --> 00:54:00.685
I can't, I can't do it all at the same time like God does.

956
00:54:02.225 --> 00:54:04.765
And three like a CNE

957
00:54:04.765 --> 00:54:07.485
and a G, yeah, it's beautiful together

958
00:54:07.505 --> 00:54:11.245
and they're individual, but you can play them individually

959
00:54:11.665 --> 00:54:12.885
and you don't have to have 'em

960
00:54:12.885 --> 00:54:14.245
as a chord and even as a chord.

961
00:54:14.245 --> 00:54:16.805
They're three distinctly separate notes

962
00:54:17.505 --> 00:54:20.885
and they don't really have a functional tie

963
00:54:21.025 --> 00:54:23.845
to the cord necessarily.

964
00:54:25.065 --> 00:54:27.645
So I stopped short

965
00:54:27.665 --> 00:54:30.285
of analogies.

966
00:54:30.545 --> 00:54:33.725
You're saying good thinking though. I love it.

967
00:54:33.805 --> 00:54:36.925
I love the, but it's very hard

968
00:54:36.925 --> 00:54:39.565
to find something like the trinity in our natural

969
00:54:39.575 --> 00:54:40.765
world and in our experience.

970
00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:44.765
Um, and we have to really be honest

971
00:54:44.765 --> 00:54:46.365
that there isn't anything like it.

972
00:54:47.385 --> 00:54:50.355
This doctrine is not something we can duplicate

973
00:54:50.895 --> 00:54:53.915
in our understanding in our minds.

974
00:54:54.135 --> 00:54:56.995
It just is not, we have to take these concepts.

975
00:54:56.995 --> 00:54:59.955
We have to, we have to research 'em, we have

976
00:54:59.955 --> 00:55:02.915
to build 'em up, we have to understand them, we have

977
00:55:02.915 --> 00:55:07.715
to believe them And we kind

978
00:55:07.715 --> 00:55:09.155
of will hit a wall at some point.

979
00:55:12.235 --> 00:55:16.995
I don't believe that that wall is um, reach just

980
00:55:17.055 --> 00:55:18.435
yet because I do believe

981
00:55:18.435 --> 00:55:20.315
that we're still supposed to see this.

982
00:55:21.005 --> 00:55:22.475
We're still supposed to study this.

983
00:55:22.475 --> 00:55:26.075
We're still still supposed to meditate on who God is,

984
00:55:28.205 --> 00:55:30.155
Can't fully know him, but we can know him

985
00:55:30.735 --> 00:55:32.355
And but we can know him

986
00:55:32.535 --> 00:55:35.235
and we can know him better tomorrow than we do today.

987
00:55:35.905 --> 00:55:37.205
And we can knowing better the day

988
00:55:37.205 --> 00:55:39.125
after that than we did tomorrow.

989
00:55:39.825 --> 00:55:43.285
And so there's still grounds for searching

990
00:55:43.305 --> 00:55:46.085
and seeking in our faith to grow in our faith.

991
00:55:47.935 --> 00:55:50.955
So that wall, we may never hit the wall until

992
00:55:51.705 --> 00:55:52.475
it's our last

993
00:55:52.655 --> 00:55:56.875
breath, but there is a wall.

994
00:55:57.255 --> 00:55:59.675
We are not God and we will not be God

995
00:56:00.335 --> 00:56:02.715
and we will not fully understand this.

996
00:56:05.805 --> 00:56:07.395
Maybe, probably ever, maybe,

997
00:56:07.815 --> 00:56:09.915
but especially not in this lifetime.

998
00:56:10.695 --> 00:56:14.795
So let's go on to errors in this third essential here.

999
00:56:14.985 --> 00:56:16.755
That each person is fully God.

1000
00:56:16.755 --> 00:56:18.795
Do you see the difference between essential two and three?

1001
00:56:19.615 --> 00:56:23.645
Is that true that God is three

1002
00:56:23.675 --> 00:56:25.365
persons, is number two?

1003
00:56:26.105 --> 00:56:30.085
Number three is each of those persons is fully gone.

1004
00:56:30.835 --> 00:56:32.365
Okay? Is that distinction clear?

1005
00:56:33.545 --> 00:56:37.205
Do you, okay, so let's,

1006
00:56:37.875 --> 00:56:39.845
what happens if we get something wrong here?

1007
00:56:41.635 --> 00:56:45.165
This error diminishes or removes one

1008
00:56:45.225 --> 00:56:49.285
or more attributes of God from one

1009
00:56:49.285 --> 00:56:50.485
of the persons of the Trinity.

1010
00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.165
Okay? Lemme go through that again.

1011
00:56:53.675 --> 00:56:56.845
This error diminishes or removes one

1012
00:56:56.905 --> 00:57:00.365
or more attributes of God from a person of the trinity.

1013
00:57:04.665 --> 00:57:07.445
The example is Arianism, okay?

1014
00:57:08.085 --> 00:57:11.925
A very popular heresy in the early church did not believe

1015
00:57:11.925 --> 00:57:13.325
that Jesus was full of God.

1016
00:57:14.205 --> 00:57:15.645
Subordinationism, that is

1017
00:57:16.365 --> 00:57:20.285
a hierarchy in nature, not in function.

1018
00:57:20.745 --> 00:57:23.285
So that means that one is lesser in nature

1019
00:57:23.755 --> 00:57:24.925
than the other, okay?

1020
00:57:24.925 --> 00:57:28.125
And that we can't, we can't do that adoption isn't

1021
00:57:28.125 --> 00:57:30.365
that Jesus was just an adopted son, okay?

1022
00:57:30.465 --> 00:57:32.165
His baptism, he became God's

1023
00:57:32.165 --> 00:57:36.005
son Again.

1024
00:57:36.025 --> 00:57:38.445
You've got five minutes and David's gonna come up here.

1025
00:57:38.915 --> 00:57:42.885
What I'm going to do is now bring this home.

1026
00:57:43.355 --> 00:57:45.125
This was a lot of Dr through mud.

1027
00:57:45.125 --> 00:57:47.045
This was a lot of academia.

1028
00:57:47.355 --> 00:57:50.815
This is a lot of, um, funny Greek words.

1029
00:57:50.885 --> 00:57:53.295
This is a lot of stuff that you know, we have in our heads.

1030
00:57:53.315 --> 00:57:55.455
Now what do we do with it once it's in our heads?

1031
00:57:56.995 --> 00:57:58.255
I'm a firm believer that you,

1032
00:57:58.255 --> 00:57:59.615
God put this stuff in your heads,

1033
00:58:00.555 --> 00:58:02.055
but what do we do with it now?

1034
00:58:02.115 --> 00:58:04.655
How does it affect our live lives?

1035
00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:08.935
So let's go back to our salvation and let's see how God

1036
00:58:08.995 --> 00:58:11.295
and his triunity works in our salvation.

1037
00:58:11.445 --> 00:58:15.535
Paul says in conclusions in him, you also,

1038
00:58:15.535 --> 00:58:19.615
when you heard the word truth, the gospel of your salvation

1039
00:58:19.715 --> 00:58:22.775
and believed in him, Jesus were sealed

1040
00:58:22.775 --> 00:58:26.655
with the promised Holy Spirit who is the guarantee

1041
00:58:26.675 --> 00:58:29.575
of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it

1042
00:58:29.595 --> 00:58:30.695
to the praise of His glory.

1043
00:58:31.955 --> 00:58:33.015
See how they work together?

1044
00:58:35.515 --> 00:58:38.015
We all know the gospel where it says believe in

1045
00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:39.095
him, believe in Jesus.

1046
00:58:40.725 --> 00:58:43.535
What happens to the Holy Spirit then enters our

1047
00:58:43.565 --> 00:58:45.655
life at that moment.

1048
00:58:46.405 --> 00:58:48.415
Okay, we're in. Dwell with the Holy Spirit

1049
00:58:50.755 --> 00:58:54.695
Is a beautiful reality of the three in one,

1050
00:58:55.245 --> 00:58:56.495
working in unity.

1051
00:58:56.815 --> 00:58:59.295
Triunity working in unity, right?

1052
00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:04.375
Jesus says, when the spirit of truth comes,

1053
00:59:04.555 --> 00:59:05.935
he will guide you into all the truth.

1054
00:59:06.715 --> 00:59:08.735
For he will not speak on his own authority.

1055
00:59:08.735 --> 00:59:10.655
Notice he calls him, he is not a dick,

1056
00:59:12.575 --> 00:59:14.475
always fears a he. Why is he a he

1057
00:59:15.075 --> 00:59:16.075
A person? 'cause

1058
00:59:16.075 --> 00:59:17.155
he's a person, he's God.

1059
00:59:17.945 --> 00:59:20.195
Same pronouns can do what the Father is the Son.

1060
00:59:22.305 --> 00:59:25.765
But whenever he hears, he will speak interesting

1061
00:59:26.145 --> 00:59:27.645
and he will declare you the things

1062
00:59:27.645 --> 00:59:29.525
that have become He will glorify me.

1063
00:59:29.805 --> 00:59:33.005
Remember, Jesus was asking for the Father to glorify him

1064
00:59:33.585 --> 00:59:36.485
and now he's saying that the Spirit will also glorify him.

1065
00:59:36.595 --> 00:59:39.165
This glory that God said he would give

1066
00:59:39.245 --> 00:59:41.725
to no other is shared.

1067
00:59:41.805 --> 00:59:42.845
A hundred percent, a hundred percent,

1068
00:59:42.925 --> 00:59:44.085
a hundred percent within the trinity.

1069
00:59:45.355 --> 00:59:48.325
Each gets glory in its fullest.

1070
00:59:49.945 --> 00:59:51.525
But he will take what is mind.

1071
00:59:51.655 --> 00:59:53.605
Jesus says, and declare it to you.

1072
00:59:53.665 --> 00:59:55.405
All of the Father has is mind.

1073
00:59:56.035 --> 00:59:58.525
Therefore I said that He will take what is mind

1074
00:59:58.525 --> 01:00:01.285
and declare to you everything the Father has as mind

1075
01:00:01.285 --> 01:00:04.925
and the Holy Spirit will tell you this is a beautiful image

1076
01:00:05.065 --> 01:00:08.925
of how the Trinity works in this scenario.

1077
01:00:08.935 --> 01:00:10.805
Jesus is talking about, this is our daily life.

1078
01:00:10.805 --> 01:00:14.215
This is whenever we need help. Whenever we need help.

1079
01:00:14.475 --> 01:00:17.255
How often we need help. I need lot, a lot.

1080
01:00:18.405 --> 01:00:23.255
It's the triune God supplying this help to us.

1081
01:00:26.005 --> 01:00:30.215
He's our equipper. Now there are varieties of gifts, okay?

1082
01:00:30.215 --> 01:00:33.015
These are spiritual gifts, but the same spirit

1083
01:00:33.075 --> 01:00:35.415
and there are varieties of service, but the same board.

1084
01:00:35.415 --> 01:00:37.095
There's varieties of activities,

1085
01:00:37.115 --> 01:00:40.455
but there's the same God who empowers them all in everyone.

1086
01:00:42.355 --> 01:00:46.415
It is God dispensing to all believers,

1087
01:00:47.665 --> 01:00:51.215
these gifts, the same spirit, the same board,

1088
01:00:52.235 --> 01:00:53.935
the same God equipment.

1089
01:00:56.595 --> 01:01:00.495
And last one, he's our unity.

1090
01:01:01.765 --> 01:01:02.765
This is

1091
01:01:04.405 --> 01:01:08.055
Guys, This is amazing and God, God is one.

1092
01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:11.575
There is unity in God, but he's trying you.

1093
01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:14.215
So there's trinity in the unity.

1094
01:01:14.315 --> 01:01:16.895
But this trinity now becomes the basis for us

1095
01:01:17.115 --> 01:01:18.455
as individual persons

1096
01:01:20.155 --> 01:01:22.455
to have unity with each other.

1097
01:01:23.725 --> 01:01:24.775
This is what the verse says.

1098
01:01:24.775 --> 01:01:27.175
There is one body and one spirit just as you are called

1099
01:01:27.275 --> 01:01:30.655
to the one hope that belongs to you, to your call.

1100
01:01:31.075 --> 01:01:34.655
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God,

1101
01:01:35.395 --> 01:01:39.215
and Father of all who is over all and through all.

1102
01:01:40.355 --> 01:01:45.255
And in all the triune God is

1103
01:01:45.255 --> 01:01:50.095
the sole basis for why we as individual people,

1104
01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:54.295
I'm not blood related to any of you,

1105
01:01:56.395 --> 01:01:57.735
but you're all brothers and sisters.

1106
01:01:59.765 --> 01:02:01.735
That just blows me away as an only child.

1107
01:02:01.755 --> 01:02:03.095
And that's very special to me.

1108
01:02:03.295 --> 01:02:05.895
I now have lots of brothers and sisters and I love 'em all.

1109
01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:11.375
And it's because of the tri of God equipping us

1110
01:02:11.635 --> 01:02:15.575
and causing us to be kindred spirits with each other.

1111
01:02:17.585 --> 01:02:19.965
Right? So the Trinity is not just important

1112
01:02:20.325 --> 01:02:21.645
academically, it's, it is our life.

1113
01:02:22.075 --> 01:02:23.405
This document is our life.

1114
01:02:23.475 --> 01:02:25.965
It's our, it's our function within the church.

1115
01:02:25.995 --> 01:02:27.085
It's our reason for living.

1116
01:02:27.235 --> 01:02:31.645
It's our, it's the unification of all of us as Christians.

1117
01:02:32.275 --> 01:02:35.765
Okay? And with that, I can stick around afterwards

1118
01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:39.365
for questions, but we have a, we have a guest teacher here.

1119
01:02:40.115 --> 01:02:41.805
Give it up Dave. Everybody

1120
01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:46.125
I like. Thank you.

1121
01:02:46.125 --> 01:02:49.005
Okay, so everybody hold your hands up,

1122
01:02:49.775 --> 01:02:51.645
stand up, get some blood flow.

1123
01:02:51.645 --> 01:02:54.565
You're gonna need it all. Here we go.

1124
01:02:55.955 --> 01:02:57.365
Okay, go ahead and sit back down.

1125
01:02:57.955 --> 01:02:59.885
This is the book that we had one,

1126
01:02:59.885 --> 01:03:01.125
the books we had recommended

1127
01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:03.125
for the court delighting in the Trinity.

1128
01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:06.765
It is awesome. Please read it.

1129
01:03:06.765 --> 01:03:09.325
Delighting Trinity written by Michael Reeds.

1130
01:03:09.325 --> 01:03:12.805
He is the president of the seminary in Wales back, uh,

1131
01:03:13.015 --> 01:03:15.045
Wells pastor that was recently here,

1132
01:03:16.545 --> 01:03:18.245
uh, came and everything.

1133
01:03:19.035 --> 01:03:20.605
He's attending his seminary.

1134
01:03:20.745 --> 01:03:22.245
So, okay,

1135
01:03:22.545 --> 01:03:25.405
so we've been talking about the Trinity and who God is.

1136
01:03:25.505 --> 01:03:29.405
So a lot of times we look at God, we may think of God

1137
01:03:29.425 --> 01:03:30.765
as a creator and river.

1138
01:03:30.905 --> 01:03:33.965
We talked a little bit about that a couple weeks ago.

1139
01:03:34.585 --> 01:03:38.075
But in reality, God is loved

1140
01:03:38.075 --> 01:03:42.715
because he exists as a trinity.

1141
01:03:46.375 --> 01:03:48.755
So how do we know God is loved?

1142
01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:53.375
How do we know?

1143
01:03:55.705 --> 01:03:56.995
Thought? Say something.

1144
01:03:57.745 --> 01:04:00.355
Okay, good. Do you have an example

1145
01:04:00.455 --> 01:04:02.315
of it off the top of your head

1146
01:04:03.625 --> 01:04:06.275
That Okay, I'll let my brother, uh, two.

1147
01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:07.515
Go ahead. Four.

1148
01:04:08.655 --> 01:04:12.835
She said it. Four. I cheated. What'd you say first John.

1149
01:04:12.835 --> 01:04:14.195
Four. Okay.

1150
01:04:15.335 --> 01:04:16.515
Or go ahead Paul.

1151
01:04:17.335 --> 01:04:20.675
Way I the truth and the life.

1152
01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:24.275
No one comes to father except through me. Okay.

1153
01:04:25.855 --> 01:04:29.715
That's John. 14, six John 14. Six. Okay.

1154
01:04:30.215 --> 01:04:32.995
Uh, piano man. What's another one?

1155
01:04:34.025 --> 01:04:35.715
John 1724.

1156
01:04:35.975 --> 01:04:38.155
Father I retired that they also,

1157
01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:41.875
and you have given me, may be with me where I am

1158
01:04:43.055 --> 01:04:45.155
to see my glory that you have given me.

1159
01:04:45.475 --> 01:04:47.835
'cause you left me before the foundation of the world.

1160
01:04:48.455 --> 01:04:50.875
We know God is love 'cause he's a father

1161
01:04:51.535 --> 01:04:52.835
and Jesus is his son.

1162
01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:57.195
He loves the son. That life-giving love of the Son.

1163
01:04:57.615 --> 01:05:00.355
The triune God includes the Father, the Son,

1164
01:05:00.615 --> 01:05:01.635
and the Holy Spirit.

1165
01:05:02.055 --> 01:05:06.275
The Father is so-called because he is a life-giving father

1166
01:05:06.695 --> 01:05:07.715
and father's children.

1167
01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:12.035
God has always existed as a father throughout eternity

1168
01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:15.275
is naturally outgoing and life giving.

1169
01:05:15.935 --> 01:05:17.035
And one John,

1170
01:05:18.345 --> 01:05:22.805
or yeah, first John four, it says, let us love one another.

1171
01:05:23.425 --> 01:05:25.125
For love comes from God.

1172
01:05:26.045 --> 01:05:29.685
Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.

1173
01:05:30.195 --> 01:05:31.965
Whoever does not love God,

1174
01:05:33.385 --> 01:05:36.805
but whoever does not love does not know God

1175
01:05:37.235 --> 01:05:39.125
because God is love.

1176
01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:41.865
Okay, so you ready?

1177
01:05:42.485 --> 01:05:44.465
But how does genuine love

1178
01:05:45.535 --> 01:05:50.185
from God differ from the love that a wicked man,

1179
01:05:51.095 --> 01:05:54.265
such as as he shows love to his son?

1180
01:05:54.765 --> 01:05:55.765
How is that different?

1181
01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:59.465
It's steadfast, unconditional.

1182
01:05:59.975 --> 01:06:02.545
Unconditional. See, would he not, would

1183
01:06:02.545 --> 01:06:06.225
that wicked man not have unconditional towards his own son?

1184
01:06:08.535 --> 01:06:10.545
That own Person. His own person? Okay.

1185
01:06:13.725 --> 01:06:14.725
Anyone else?

1186
01:06:18.495 --> 01:06:22.225
Imagine a love that's, that's gonna meet your every need

1187
01:06:23.835 --> 01:06:27.305
based on how much and what exactly you need it to be.

1188
01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:30.985
It's a love that with Jesus is full of grace

1189
01:06:31.005 --> 01:06:33.145
and truth we talked about maybe two weeks ago.

1190
01:06:34.295 --> 01:06:35.945
It's, it's perfect love.

1191
01:06:36.765 --> 01:06:39.745
We, we might be able to have unconditional love as far

1192
01:06:39.745 --> 01:06:42.145
as we're able to define it and act on uncondition.

1193
01:06:43.335 --> 01:06:45.435
But I would, I would argue

1194
01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:47.675
that his is perfectly unconditional.

1195
01:06:48.225 --> 01:06:50.315
Okay, good. And his is perfectly full

1196
01:06:50.315 --> 01:06:51.675
of grace when we need grace

1197
01:06:51.855 --> 01:06:53.915
and perfectly full of truth when we need truth.

1198
01:06:54.935 --> 01:06:57.275
And that love is really hard to replicate in our,

1199
01:06:57.615 --> 01:06:58.955
in ourselves, right?

1200
01:06:59.335 --> 01:07:00.915
And, and, and I don't know that we can,

1201
01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:02.885
Right?

1202
01:07:03.695 --> 01:07:06.835
You had, so, uh, just while we were still centered back

1203
01:07:06.855 --> 01:07:10.115
for us that perfect.

1204
01:07:12.345 --> 01:07:15.275
Good. Alright, so let's skip on here

1205
01:07:15.275 --> 01:07:17.035
and know that in four,

1206
01:07:17.165 --> 01:07:21.835
since the Christian God is striking the tri, the Trinity

1207
01:07:22.615 --> 01:07:25.955
is at the heart of all Christian faith shaping

1208
01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:28.115
and strengthening every other truth.

1209
01:07:28.815 --> 01:07:30.755
It supports all Christian thinking.

1210
01:07:32.015 --> 01:07:34.635
So now we get to get personal here we'll go.

1211
01:07:35.215 --> 01:07:39.635
Do you consider the relationship within the triune God,

1212
01:07:41.235 --> 01:07:45.685
when you form your thoughts, how you respond

1213
01:07:45.745 --> 01:07:49.125
to somebody else, you actually think that through.

1214
01:07:49.825 --> 01:07:52.845
That's how the, the relationship of God the father

1215
01:07:52.865 --> 01:07:54.085
and loving and the Son

1216
01:07:54.385 --> 01:07:57.045
and that reflection of his love back to the Father.

1217
01:07:58.105 --> 01:08:00.725
You think about that the way when you respond to somebody,

1218
01:08:00.755 --> 01:08:03.925
when they then, when they've done something

1219
01:08:03.925 --> 01:08:07.725
or said something to you, you think about that love

1220
01:08:07.725 --> 01:08:08.725
that you've received.

1221
01:08:11.235 --> 01:08:12.565
Anybody have any examples?

1222
01:08:12.605 --> 01:08:16.425
I know that's a tough one, but I wanted to go there just

1223
01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:21.065
to help us because a Aaron always, in some of his classes,

1224
01:08:22.085 --> 01:08:25.225
he was talking about how we gotta think about

1225
01:08:25.605 --> 01:08:27.825
how God would think and take it

1226
01:08:27.925 --> 01:08:32.145
and take all of our thoughts, Kathy, in the mind to

1227
01:08:32.415 --> 01:08:35.585
what God would be thinking right before him.

1228
01:08:35.735 --> 01:08:37.225
Naturally our response,

1229
01:08:37.285 --> 01:08:41.025
and This applies them here,

1230
01:08:43.255 --> 01:08:47.505
love even when it's hard, how can, how can you

1231
01:08:48.495 --> 01:08:51.945
intentionally show love to someone difficult today?

1232
01:08:52.945 --> 01:08:56.745
And what specific steps can you take to see them

1233
01:08:56.775 --> 01:09:00.065
through God's eyes?

1234
01:09:03.245 --> 01:09:04.905
You realize they're, they're broken.

1235
01:09:06.565 --> 01:09:08.985
You know, God loves me a broken person.

1236
01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:12.905
God also gonna love that as person.

1237
01:09:13.085 --> 01:09:17.305
We need to be a witness to, to show them that love

1238
01:09:18.285 --> 01:09:19.705
God, you.

1239
01:09:21.565 --> 01:09:22.585
And if they're not a

1240
01:09:22.585 --> 01:09:24.185
Christian, how are they gonna know you?

1241
01:09:27.015 --> 01:09:30.745
That love right? Says they'll know I love him.

1242
01:09:33.295 --> 01:09:37.545
Alright, let the

1243
01:09:37.545 --> 01:09:39.145
Trinity shape your identity.

1244
01:09:39.365 --> 01:09:42.185
How can you remind yourself each day that your

1245
01:09:42.705 --> 01:09:44.625
identity is rooted in God's life

1246
01:09:45.005 --> 01:09:48.345
and your relationship with the Father, the Son,

1247
01:09:48.405 --> 01:09:49.425
and the Holy Spirit?

1248
01:09:53.645 --> 01:09:58.105
How can you remind yourself each day that your identity,

1249
01:09:58.485 --> 01:10:00.665
who you are as a Christian

1250
01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:05.305
who may born again, you have the Holy Spirit,

1251
01:10:05.325 --> 01:10:08.185
and how do you remind yourself on that?

1252
01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:11.745
And now God's love and your relationship with him,

1253
01:10:13.665 --> 01:10:18.225
I say ways and just our existence that all those

1254
01:10:18.935 --> 01:10:22.425
that of God life through

1255
01:10:24.975 --> 01:10:28.105
with spirit that speaks up in the Creation act.

1256
01:10:28.205 --> 01:10:32.065
So just the fact that we wake up, we take a breath in,

1257
01:10:32.255 --> 01:10:33.905
there's life and a breath.

1258
01:10:34.215 --> 01:10:37.185
Mind of the Spirit reminded our position

1259
01:10:38.085 --> 01:10:39.225
of being called sons

1260
01:10:39.225 --> 01:10:44.105
and daughters adopted, that just our existence within

1261
01:10:44.105 --> 01:10:46.985
his family and our relationship remains based on our

1262
01:10:47.425 --> 01:10:48.865
identity as being sons

1263
01:10:48.865 --> 01:10:51.705
and daughters, which will inherit by Jesus' son,

1264
01:10:52.075 --> 01:10:54.145
which give us relationship to the Father

1265
01:10:55.255 --> 01:10:57.785
that we be His presence.

1266
01:10:58.995 --> 01:11:01.425
Speak to the Father, spoken.

1267
01:11:02.885 --> 01:11:06.505
Um, so just outta existing.

1268
01:11:14.315 --> 01:11:17.325
Alright, thank you. That's all I got.

1269
01:11:18.905 --> 01:11:19.885
So, so

1270
01:11:32.585 --> 01:11:33.285
why don't we stand

1271
01:12:48.465 --> 01:12:48.685
The

1272
01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:31.875
Pray for us.

1273
01:15:35.115 --> 01:15:38.085
Lord, I don't believe we touched on a 10th

1274
01:15:38.905 --> 01:15:40.605
of this doctrine tonight, that

1275
01:15:43.515 --> 01:15:45.645
that is the reality of you are.

1276
01:15:46.985 --> 01:15:48.645
But Lord, we did the best that we can.

1277
01:15:48.785 --> 01:15:52.805
And we feel you in this, this lest the Father

1278
01:15:53.265 --> 01:15:56.525
and I pray that the words tonight would be,

1279
01:15:58.095 --> 01:16:02.125
Would, uh, would go with everybody as they leave this place.

1280
01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:03.725
Father. And this, these words would

1281
01:16:04.635 --> 01:16:08.405
rest on our souls tonight, even as we go in our cars

1282
01:16:08.665 --> 01:16:11.365
to go home, as we lay down in bed

1283
01:16:11.385 --> 01:16:14.045
and our thoughts just come rushing in.

1284
01:16:14.045 --> 01:16:15.525
Father, I I pray that

1285
01:16:16.385 --> 01:16:18.405
we wouldn't drown out these thoughts tonight.

1286
01:16:18.405 --> 01:16:20.085
That these thoughts would occupy us.

1287
01:16:20.085 --> 01:16:22.645
That we fall asleep to these thoughts tonight.

1288
01:16:23.465 --> 01:16:26.245
And we wake up to these thoughts tomorrow morning

1289
01:16:27.145 --> 01:16:30.565
and go about our day, go back to work, think about it.

1290
01:16:32.145 --> 01:16:33.245
And the next day, father

1291
01:16:33.245 --> 01:16:36.685
and I I know there, I know that there's a, a wall

1292
01:16:36.685 --> 01:16:37.805
between man and God.

1293
01:16:37.905 --> 01:16:41.405
But Father, help us always to be driving towards that wall.

1294
01:16:41.405 --> 01:16:44.805
Just equip us, power us as you know, that you've

1295
01:16:45.005 --> 01:16:48.845
provided the, the, the way for us to be able to come to you

1296
01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:51.365
closer and closer each day.

1297
01:16:51.365 --> 01:16:52.605
And I pray that for everybody here,

1298
01:16:52.605 --> 01:16:55.285
where we would just increase our faith every day

1299
01:16:55.865 --> 01:16:59.725
as you allow Father, equip us, meet us where we're at,

1300
01:17:00.755 --> 01:17:02.805
pick us up, carry us to the next stage,

1301
01:17:03.465 --> 01:17:05.125
and just trust you to do that work.

1302
01:17:05.665 --> 01:17:07.125
Be with everybody's relief here.

1303
01:17:07.125 --> 01:17:08.685
Keep us safe. Watch over us.

1304
01:17:08.685 --> 01:17:10.045
Protect Jesus.
