1
00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.265
Are you thankful for the Celebrate Recovery worship team?

2
00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:24.545
Amen. Amen. Thank you guys.

3
00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:28.385
Uh, they are so good

4
00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:30.145
and they're not used to Sunday mornings,

5
00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:32.225
and so some of them had some anxiety this morning.

6
00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:35.065
I was real proud that they just, they they did a great job.

7
00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:36.425
And so, I'm Phil Lee.

8
00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:39.345
I'm the minister of Discipleship and community here,

9
00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.665
and I wanna thank Pastor John

10
00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:43.505
and our elder council for giving me the

11
00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:44.665
opportunity to preach this morning.

12
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.905
And we're gonna be looking at the work of God

13
00:00:48.295 --> 00:00:50.825
through the ministry of a prophet named Samuel.

14
00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:53.305
And so please turn in your Bible to Samuel nine.

15
00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:55.385
We'll be looking at chapters nine and 10 today.

16
00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:56.785
And while you're turning there,

17
00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:58.345
I've got, uh, some questions.

18
00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:01.585
I think that personal reflection is important for us.

19
00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:03.945
The kind of the why me questions.

20
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:05.745
How did I get to where I am now?

21
00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:08.225
And am I where God wants me to be?

22
00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:10.745
Uh, what if I had chosen something different?

23
00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:12.545
And so questions of meaning

24
00:01:12.565 --> 00:01:14.785
and fulfillment creep in sometimes

25
00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.025
it's usually when I'm doing something that I, that

26
00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:20.825
that's just never finished, uh, like mowing

27
00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:23.305
or, um, uh, house cleaning.

28
00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:25.265
And my wife is rolling her eyes now

29
00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:26.345
because, uh, she's thinking,

30
00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:30.595
I don't remember ever seeing you do that, or traffic.

31
00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:33.075
And in Edmond, I think this is a, a kind

32
00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:34.235
of a bone to pick for a minute.

33
00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:38.675
Um, uh, if you're cleaning up somebody else's mess,

34
00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:41.315
that's an opportunity for self-reflection sometimes.

35
00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:44.715
But, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna get personal for a minute.

36
00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:47.475
How many of you have ever questioned your identity waiting

37
00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:48.475
in the school pickup line?

38
00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:51.355
Anyone? Anyone? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just a grandpa.

39
00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:53.875
And so I just get called in emergency situations

40
00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:55.995
and I'm already like, oh, are you kidding me?

41
00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:58.315
Why are these people waiting at lunch

42
00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:00.235
to pick up their kids at three?

43
00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:04.355
But anyway, um, and then there's the whole traffic issue.

44
00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:06.675
It's the only time I'm ever in a hurry,

45
00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:09.155
Edmund Stoplights mock me.

46
00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:11.925
And, uh, the absence

47
00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:15.045
of the left turn lane sometimes smirk at me.

48
00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:17.645
And so, uh, but questions

49
00:02:17.645 --> 00:02:19.165
of personal reflection are important.

50
00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:22.165
Today I'm gonna filter into the talk, an opportunity

51
00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:23.525
to tell you a story about a little boy.

52
00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:26.405
He was born and raised in a tiny rural farm

53
00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:27.605
community in western Oklahoma.

54
00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.005
This is not me, but I, I got to go

55
00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:31.765
to my grandparents every year,

56
00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:36.285
and I, I remember filling my days with fishing and,

57
00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:37.845
and I, I, they didn't let me have a

58
00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:39.005
gun, so I didn't do any hunting.

59
00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:42.205
But, um, I remember catching grasshoppers,

60
00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:44.365
and when I caught the right size grasshopper, I thought, oh,

61
00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:45.485
I'm gonna catch something with this.

62
00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:48.165
And sure enough, I would learn to bait my hook and cast

63
00:02:48.165 --> 00:02:49.565
and sometimes catch something.

64
00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:51.965
And so that's exactly what happened to him.

65
00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:56.965
And it seems as if in a small western rural farm community,

66
00:02:57.225 --> 00:03:00.385
if that's the only thing to do, I've learned

67
00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:02.585
that fishing is another great opportunity

68
00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:04.025
for personal reflection.

69
00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:06.945
And sometimes questions of meaning

70
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.185
and fulfillment are not a laughing matter.

71
00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:11.825
You ever feel like you're just going through the motions

72
00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:13.945
or you ask yourself, what's the point?

73
00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:16.465
Nothing I do seems to matter.

74
00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:20.465
You ever wonder if anybody would notice if you were gone?

75
00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:22.985
Or do you think maybe I'm just wasting space

76
00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:26.785
or just going through life one step at a time?

77
00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:29.745
Do you worry that you're not making a contribution

78
00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:31.305
or bringing any value?

79
00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:35.385
Do you battle feelings of insignificance or doubt

80
00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:37.945
or just general restlessness?

81
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:42.315
Well, these questions of significance get much darker.

82
00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.795
If you think sometimes people will do things

83
00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:47.515
to numb those feelings of meaninglessness

84
00:03:47.935 --> 00:03:50.755
and insignificance, sometimes they'll numb them

85
00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:52.035
with dangerous behaviors.

86
00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:53.475
And I'm not gonna identify

87
00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:55.115
what those dangerous behaviors are.

88
00:03:55.215 --> 00:03:56.475
You know what they are.

89
00:03:57.655 --> 00:04:00.955
And sometimes we flirt with those dangerous behaviors.

90
00:04:00.955 --> 00:04:02.795
And some of you may be flirting with them right now,

91
00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:05.355
but I'm glad you're here

92
00:04:05.355 --> 00:04:07.595
because if you'll give me 25 more minutes,

93
00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:10.435
we will learn about things about God

94
00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:12.795
that are absolutely gonna change your perspective.

95
00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:15.635
And as the scripture says, renew your mind.

96
00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.635
These two chapters are about God at work

97
00:04:18.655 --> 00:04:20.475
and the life of a man named Saul

98
00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:23.835
and of his chosen people, Israel, through the prophet Samuel

99
00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:26.755
and the apostle Paul, who by the way,

100
00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:29.075
was a rib rabbinically trained Pharisee,

101
00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:33.195
whose parents named him after a king named Saul.

102
00:04:34.155 --> 00:04:35.915
Summarize the work of God in Acts 13.

103
00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:36.955
You don't have to turn there,

104
00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:39.475
but it says the God of this people.

105
00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:41.395
Israel chose our fathers

106
00:04:41.535 --> 00:04:43.315
and made the people great

107
00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.675
during their stay in the land of Egypt.

108
00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:49.595
So we see up, he made their name great in the land of Egypt

109
00:04:49.815 --> 00:04:51.675
for 200 years, they were slaves.

110
00:04:51.675 --> 00:04:53.275
That's good, that's bad.

111
00:04:54.505 --> 00:04:57.685
And with an upli lifted hand, he led them out of it.

112
00:04:57.685 --> 00:05:00.205
That's good. And for about 40 years,

113
00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:01.765
he put up with them in the wilderness.

114
00:05:02.265 --> 00:05:03.845
That's bad. And then

115
00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.325
after destroying seven nations in

116
00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:06.405
the land of Canaan, that's good.

117
00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:09.875
He gave them the land as an inheritance. That's good.

118
00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.955
And this all took about 450 years.

119
00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:13.955
And after that, he gave them judges.

120
00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:18.395
That's bad until Samuel, the prophet. That's good.

121
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.915
And then he asked for, and then they asked for a king.

122
00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:27.065
That's bad. Yeah, that's bad. And God warned them.

123
00:05:27.135 --> 00:05:28.545
This is not part of your passage here,

124
00:05:28.545 --> 00:05:30.785
but God warned 'em, this is not going to go well for you.

125
00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:35.925
But he gave them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe

126
00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:37.765
of Benjamin for 40 years.

127
00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:40.365
And so last week, pastor John did a great job,

128
00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:44.005
an excellent exposition of chapter eight, where Israel asked

129
00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:47.365
for a king, uh, the beginnings of the mark of Israel now

130
00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:48.445
as a monarchy.

131
00:05:49.145 --> 00:05:52.085
And we see the transition from, uh, uh,

132
00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:53.325
from where they were.

133
00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:55.445
I believe it was called a tribal confederacy,

134
00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:56.765
now to a monarchy.

135
00:05:57.145 --> 00:05:58.965
And Samuel was getting very old.

136
00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:01.165
Uh, why is it every time they asked me

137
00:06:01.165 --> 00:06:03.285
to preach the passages about someone old,

138
00:06:04.345 --> 00:06:08.045
he pointed his sons as judges, and they blew it.

139
00:06:08.045 --> 00:06:09.525
They had become a nightmare.

140
00:06:09.945 --> 00:06:12.085
Uh, they had become selfish and immoral

141
00:06:12.085 --> 00:06:13.365
and unjust, not

142
00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:16.445
what you want in a judge, a living nightmare.

143
00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:19.245
And these people had remembered Eli's son,

144
00:06:19.305 --> 00:06:20.445
if you remember Hockney

145
00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:24.995
and Phineas, they didn't want anything to do with a a,

146
00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:27.915
a holy man's sons or evil sons.

147
00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:31.115
And so they asked Samuel to appoint a king.

148
00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:35.075
And, and as I was studying for this passage, uh, I'm,

149
00:06:35.135 --> 00:06:36.475
I'm reading through the scriptures

150
00:06:36.475 --> 00:06:38.755
and I read in Isaiah 43, I want you to listen to this,

151
00:06:39.635 --> 00:06:41.935
but now, thus says the Lord.

152
00:06:42.075 --> 00:06:45.175
So who's speaking, Lord God, who created you?

153
00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:49.375
Oh, Jacob, who formed you? Oh, Israel, look at verse 15.

154
00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:54.775
I am the Lord, your holy one, the creator of Israel,

155
00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:56.695
your king.

156
00:06:58.465 --> 00:07:02.085
So when asking for a king, Israel's literally rejecting God

157
00:07:02.145 --> 00:07:05.165
as their king, and they wanna be like the other nations,

158
00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:06.885
but God is sovereign.

159
00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:09.685
And he warned them, if you do this, it will go badly.

160
00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:11.485
And indeed it does go badly.

161
00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:15.485
But, but what you're gonna see as we go through first

162
00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:17.005
and second Samuel, is there's up

163
00:07:17.025 --> 00:07:20.085
and down points in the life of King Saul,

164
00:07:20.705 --> 00:07:22.045
but God let them have their way.

165
00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:24.445
And Saul, the son of Kish, has chosen

166
00:07:24.465 --> 00:07:25.925
to be Israel's first king.

167
00:07:26.275 --> 00:07:28.165
Well, this little boy who grew up hunting

168
00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:30.645
and fishing one day gave his life to Jesus,

169
00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:33.825
a little Baptist church in western Oklahoma.

170
00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:37.305
And he seemed to sense God's calling

171
00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:39.545
to serve him in the gospel ministry,

172
00:07:39.845 --> 00:07:42.145
but he also grew very strong and very large,

173
00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:44.345
and became a football star in that tiny little town.

174
00:07:44.485 --> 00:07:46.345
And the University of Kansas offered him a

175
00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:47.505
scholarship to play football.

176
00:07:47.845 --> 00:07:50.385
So he had kind of a crisis of identity and belief

177
00:07:50.385 --> 00:07:51.385
and decided, you know what?

178
00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:54.545
I think since I surrendered my life to the Lord,

179
00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.475
I'm gonna become a student minister instead

180
00:07:58.055 --> 00:08:00.155
in a small town in Oklahoma.

181
00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:04.075
And, uh, I was a youth minister in Tulsa, in Oklahoma.

182
00:08:04.135 --> 00:08:05.195
And I want you to know right now,

183
00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:07.755
if I'd been given an opportunity to play Kansas football,

184
00:08:09.185 --> 00:08:10.265
I would've taken it right?

185
00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:12.025
Because that's kind of a big deal.

186
00:08:12.165 --> 00:08:14.065
Now you're a scholarshiped athlete,

187
00:08:14.085 --> 00:08:16.625
but he has decided that he's going

188
00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:19.545
to do something differently, that he's gonna not do what

189
00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:22.065
looks like everybody thinks ought to be done,

190
00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:23.745
but he's gonna do what God's called him to do.

191
00:08:24.415 --> 00:08:27.665
Well now in, uh, Samuel one

192
00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:30.185
and two, we're gonna see in chapter nine that Samuel

193
00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:32.425
acquired a king.

194
00:08:32.835 --> 00:08:35.065
Write that down. They acquired a king.

195
00:08:35.065 --> 00:08:36.145
And I wanna talk to you about,

196
00:08:36.355 --> 00:08:38.785
about confusing distractions for a minute.

197
00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:41.185
There's a, uh, verses one

198
00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:43.785
and two are kind of a microcosm of chapters nine and 10,

199
00:08:44.165 --> 00:08:46.745
but it'll show you how we'll be looking at these in

200
00:08:46.765 --> 00:08:47.945
two entire chapters.

201
00:08:48.115 --> 00:08:51.465
Let's read. There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish,

202
00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:53.185
son of Abiel, son of,

203
00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:57.765
or son of Becca Roth, son of Aya, uh, Benjamin Knight,

204
00:08:58.405 --> 00:08:59.485
a man of wealth.

205
00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:01.965
Now, this is an important verse,

206
00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:04.005
but if you're not looking for it, you don't see it.

207
00:09:04.005 --> 00:09:08.285
Verse two. And this verse just frankly kind of makes me mad.

208
00:09:09.045 --> 00:09:12.585
He had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man.

209
00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:16.385
There was not a man among the people, more handsome than he

210
00:09:17.175 --> 00:09:18.545
from the shoulders upward.

211
00:09:18.605 --> 00:09:20.465
He was taller than any of the people.

212
00:09:25.715 --> 00:09:28.295
So I wanna talk about confusing distractions, okay?

213
00:09:28.355 --> 00:09:32.055
If you are not looking verse one doesn't seem

214
00:09:32.285 --> 00:09:36.215
that important, but this is about a man of Benjamin

215
00:09:37.175 --> 00:09:41.205
whose name was Kish, a Benjamin Knight, a man of wealth.

216
00:09:42.075 --> 00:09:44.125
It's important because if we're not looking for it,

217
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.725
we'll forget the fact that Saul was a Benjaminite.

218
00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:52.485
This is about 825 years in between Genesis 49

219
00:09:53.065 --> 00:09:55.165
in first Samuel nine.

220
00:09:55.585 --> 00:09:58.765
And if you'll remember back, God made a promise to Abraham

221
00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:03.405
and Sarah saying that you'll be, uh, the, the beginnings

222
00:10:03.585 --> 00:10:05.845
of a family that will produce a king.

223
00:10:06.975 --> 00:10:11.835
And then Jacob, Abraham's grandson, he's near death

224
00:10:11.895 --> 00:10:13.915
and he calls together his 12 sons,

225
00:10:14.095 --> 00:10:16.675
and he blesses each of them in birth order.

226
00:10:17.175 --> 00:10:18.795
And these blessings, if you will,

227
00:10:18.895 --> 00:10:21.235
are actual prophecies about their future.

228
00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:24.995
And Jacob's 12 sons then become the patriarchs

229
00:10:24.995 --> 00:10:26.675
of the 12 tribes of Israel.

230
00:10:26.975 --> 00:10:30.395
So Saul is a man of Benjamin from the tribe of Benjamin.

231
00:10:30.455 --> 00:10:33.355
So when Jacob addresses his fourth son,

232
00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:35.955
it's not Benjamin, it's Judah.

233
00:10:36.255 --> 00:10:40.115
And he says in Genesis four, uh, 49 10, the scepter

234
00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:45.835
meaning the kings, the scepter shall not depart from Judah.

235
00:10:45.975 --> 00:10:48.715
Now, those of you who are, uh, familiar with scripture,

236
00:10:48.775 --> 00:10:52.075
and you followed God's covenant promise all the way through

237
00:10:52.335 --> 00:10:54.395
to the New Testament, you'll realize,

238
00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:58.115
and by the way, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars agree

239
00:10:58.115 --> 00:11:01.355
with Christian scholars that this is a messianic prophecy

240
00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:04.315
that God's king will come from the tribe of Judah.

241
00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:06.195
You've heard of the lion of Judah, right?

242
00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:08.235
Jesus is the king of kings

243
00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:10.715
and the lion from the tribe of Judah.

244
00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:13.635
Amen? Now, this is a prophecy saying

245
00:11:13.635 --> 00:11:16.275
that Jesus will establish an everlasting kingdom.

246
00:11:17.195 --> 00:11:19.895
And he was born about 2000 years after Jacob died.

247
00:11:19.915 --> 00:11:23.135
But, but you can trace his ancestry back to Judah,

248
00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:25.695
both in Luke three and in Matthew one.

249
00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:27.295
But here's an essential fact

250
00:11:27.295 --> 00:11:29.055
that if you're not looking for it, you'll miss.

251
00:11:29.485 --> 00:11:32.415
Saul is not from the tribe of Judah.

252
00:11:32.955 --> 00:11:35.135
Now, the tribal leaders, they don't know about God's

253
00:11:35.135 --> 00:11:38.495
promises, yet they've not followed God's covenant still

254
00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:39.575
very, very early on.

255
00:11:39.575 --> 00:11:42.535
So we can't blame them for missing this covenant promise.

256
00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:46.535
But we know that God intended to fulfill this covenant

257
00:11:46.635 --> 00:11:49.935
of promise to Abraham, and through Jacob,

258
00:11:50.355 --> 00:11:53.605
and through the tribe of Judah, a king will come

259
00:11:53.605 --> 00:11:55.085
through the tribe of Judah

260
00:11:55.185 --> 00:11:59.165
and will fulfill the promise of the lion of Judah

261
00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:00.725
and the lion of David.

262
00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:03.205
But right now, the timing isn't right.

263
00:12:03.205 --> 00:12:07.045
In one Samuel, God will fulfill his promise

264
00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:09.845
in his way and in his time.

265
00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:13.485
But what he's got right now is a really tall, good looking,

266
00:12:13.485 --> 00:12:14.485
wealthy benge of mine.

267
00:12:15.285 --> 00:12:19.255
Okay? So Saul, according to verse two, was tall and wealthy.

268
00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:21.495
Now, you might think, oh, this is, this is important.

269
00:12:21.505 --> 00:12:24.375
Write this down. Well, this is just a minor fact.

270
00:12:25.235 --> 00:12:27.535
In fact, he's one of the only Israelites identified

271
00:12:27.535 --> 00:12:30.895
as someone being very tall, being wealthy and tall

272
00:12:30.915 --> 00:12:33.135
and handsome, like all the kings

273
00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:35.935
of the other nations is important to the Israelites,

274
00:12:36.895 --> 00:12:38.315
but it's not that important to God.

275
00:12:39.315 --> 00:12:40.575
But because he was so wealthy

276
00:12:40.675 --> 00:12:43.575
and good looking, the people imagined him

277
00:12:43.635 --> 00:12:45.415
to be the king that they wanted.

278
00:12:45.955 --> 00:12:47.975
And so God allowed Saul to be king,

279
00:12:49.075 --> 00:12:52.175
but this wasn't the kind of king that God had promised

280
00:12:52.175 --> 00:12:53.295
and God had planned.

281
00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:56.455
He wasn't unique from other kings.

282
00:12:56.595 --> 00:12:59.135
He was like the na, the kings of the other nations.

283
00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:03.255
And so even if it wasn't perfect, God would continue

284
00:13:03.255 --> 00:13:04.615
to work through this choice.

285
00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:08.315
Now, listen, wisdom is

286
00:13:08.835 --> 00:13:10.875
ignoring confusing distraction

287
00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:13.915
and focusing on God's promises.

288
00:13:14.215 --> 00:13:17.355
And with that, I wanna talk about lost donkeys for a minute.

289
00:13:18.505 --> 00:13:22.435
Okay? So the story starts off with Saul

290
00:13:22.575 --> 00:13:25.955
and an unnamed service on a mission sent by his father

291
00:13:26.215 --> 00:13:28.275
to find some lost donkeys.

292
00:13:29.245 --> 00:13:31.635
Verse three. Now the donkeys of Kish

293
00:13:32.335 --> 00:13:33.795
Saul's father were lost.

294
00:13:34.175 --> 00:13:36.235
So the king said to his son,

295
00:13:36.575 --> 00:13:39.955
or I mean, Kish said to his son, take one of the young men

296
00:13:39.955 --> 00:13:42.315
with you and arise and go and look for the donkeys.

297
00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:45.155
So it seems like maybe a little boy catching

298
00:13:45.155 --> 00:13:46.315
grasshoppers to go fishing.

299
00:13:46.435 --> 00:13:48.395
I mean, it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, right?

300
00:13:48.535 --> 00:13:53.455
But listen, there's a literary motif,

301
00:13:53.775 --> 00:13:57.775
a pattern all through one Samuel, where Saul proves

302
00:13:57.775 --> 00:13:59.215
to not be a good shepherd.

303
00:14:00.015 --> 00:14:03.475
And he's a, a lousy guy, probably as a wealthy young man,

304
00:14:03.495 --> 00:14:05.995
had never had an opportunity to search for lost donkeys.

305
00:14:06.215 --> 00:14:08.835
But this is a pattern that Saul's not a good shepherd.

306
00:14:08.935 --> 00:14:12.315
And in contrast, the scripture describes David

307
00:14:13.055 --> 00:14:15.915
Saul's replacement from the line of Judah

308
00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:20.575
as God's plan for Israel's king as an excellent shepherd.

309
00:14:20.915 --> 00:14:23.535
His leadership, his strength is dependence on God,

310
00:14:24.035 --> 00:14:25.775
all examples of being a good shepherd.

311
00:14:26.235 --> 00:14:29.935
So King David from the tribe of Judah gives us a huge hint

312
00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.455
as far as what you want in a king.

313
00:14:31.635 --> 00:14:33.695
And that's what he says in Psalms 23.

314
00:14:33.965 --> 00:14:36.015
Most of us can quote it, the Lord

315
00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:39.405
is my shepherd, I shall not want.

316
00:14:40.105 --> 00:14:42.755
So David acknowledges that his strength,

317
00:14:43.395 --> 00:14:44.515
strength comes from the Lord.

318
00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:47.395
And then even a better contrast than that,

319
00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:50.555
we find in John 10 when Jesus himself is speaking

320
00:14:50.575 --> 00:14:53.485
and he says, I am the good shepherd.

321
00:14:54.745 --> 00:14:58.145
I know my own and my own know me

322
00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:02.475
just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father,

323
00:15:02.975 --> 00:15:05.995
and I lay down my life for my sheep.

324
00:15:06.535 --> 00:15:07.835
Now, I want to talk about shepherding.

325
00:15:07.835 --> 00:15:09.555
Well, for a minute, you guys know I'm the pastor

326
00:15:09.795 --> 00:15:11.195
of discipleship and community,

327
00:15:11.495 --> 00:15:14.875
and you know that my, my role here is to help the church

328
00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:17.395
to identify a disciple making church, a culture

329
00:15:18.055 --> 00:15:19.075
and a disciple.

330
00:15:19.095 --> 00:15:22.475
Making culture is not a good culture if it's not a

331
00:15:22.995 --> 00:15:25.275
shepherd culture or a good shepherd culture.

332
00:15:26.335 --> 00:15:27.675
Um, and,

333
00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:30.035
and I probably am not gonna say anything more important than

334
00:15:30.035 --> 00:15:31.235
what I'm about to say right now.

335
00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:36.335
If you are not involved in a disciple making relationship,

336
00:15:36.795 --> 00:15:38.655
if you're not being shepherded, well,

337
00:15:39.035 --> 00:15:40.455
you are in spiritual danger.

338
00:15:40.995 --> 00:15:42.855
As a matter of fact, if you're here

339
00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:45.575
and you're not involved in a disciple making relationship,

340
00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:48.775
odds are that you'll not be here in two years.

341
00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:51.615
There's no real connection, there's no real guiding

342
00:15:51.635 --> 00:15:53.455
or protecting, and you'll move on

343
00:15:53.455 --> 00:15:55.575
because you won't think this is a good place for you.

344
00:15:55.595 --> 00:16:00.255
But, but I want you to know we have 65 community groups each

345
00:16:00.255 --> 00:16:03.335
with 65 plus leaders

346
00:16:04.115 --> 00:16:05.575
all working at shepherding.

347
00:16:05.605 --> 00:16:07.615
Well, what does a good shepherd do?

348
00:16:08.325 --> 00:16:11.615
Well, it watches out for dangerous enemies that might attack

349
00:16:11.675 --> 00:16:15.135
or, and it, it, a good shepherd protects and defends and,

350
00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:17.735
and tends to the sick and to the wound

351
00:16:17.735 --> 00:16:19.295
and a good shepherd searches

352
00:16:19.715 --> 00:16:22.095
and rescues the loss or trapped.

353
00:16:22.995 --> 00:16:25.535
Um, we have 65 community groups,

354
00:16:25.595 --> 00:16:28.775
but we also have in the neighborhood of 30 micro groups.

355
00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:30.295
Now, these are gender-based groups

356
00:16:30.295 --> 00:16:32.255
that go deeper relationally

357
00:16:32.515 --> 00:16:34.375
and ask questions of accountabilities

358
00:16:34.405 --> 00:16:35.455
like, how are you doing?

359
00:16:35.955 --> 00:16:37.695
Are you, have you been staying in God's word?

360
00:16:38.195 --> 00:16:40.095
How can I pray for you? And then they do pray

361
00:16:40.095 --> 00:16:42.535
for one another, and they go deeper and deeper and deeper.

362
00:16:42.915 --> 00:16:45.095
And something that I'm very, very excited about is

363
00:16:45.095 --> 00:16:46.935
that next Sunday at five o'clock,

364
00:16:47.345 --> 00:16:51.055
we'll be launching our mentor ministry, both men and women.

365
00:16:51.555 --> 00:16:55.215
And if you don't have someone who shepherds you well,

366
00:16:55.355 --> 00:16:58.575
who loves you and encourages you, who you learn to trust

367
00:16:58.595 --> 00:17:02.615
and to follow someone who, uh, leads and guides

368
00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:05.335
and feeds the sheep, if you don't have someone,

369
00:17:05.355 --> 00:17:06.775
you're in spiritual danger.

370
00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:09.375
And the good shepherd loves the sheep

371
00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:11.775
and tries to earn the trust of the mentor.

372
00:17:11.835 --> 00:17:14.375
And so at the end of the service, if you go right across

373
00:17:14.395 --> 00:17:17.255
to the, to the cross, you'll see two bistro tables

374
00:17:17.355 --> 00:17:19.735
and a sign that says, men's and women's ministering.

375
00:17:19.755 --> 00:17:21.295
I'd like for you to get involved in that

376
00:17:22.445 --> 00:17:26.495
because true followers of the good shepherd,

377
00:17:27.535 --> 00:17:30.305
love and trust the shepherd above all others.

378
00:17:30.805 --> 00:17:32.585
And I pray that you have a relationship

379
00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:34.185
with the good shepherd, Jesus Christ.

380
00:17:34.585 --> 00:17:35.905
I pray that you're involved in

381
00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:37.305
the disciple making relationship.

382
00:17:37.885 --> 00:17:40.465
Do you know the Good Shepherd?

383
00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:44.435
Well, Saul couldn't find the lost donkeys,

384
00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.235
and he's ready to quit and go home.

385
00:17:48.095 --> 00:17:50.325
And then an unnamed servant suggests

386
00:17:50.325 --> 00:17:53.245
that they go visit the man of God in a nearby town

387
00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:54.725
to see if he could help.

388
00:17:55.105 --> 00:17:57.325
And Saul's like, well, we don't have any bread to give him.

389
00:17:57.325 --> 00:17:59.525
And so he's got excuses why he doesn't wanna meet

390
00:17:59.715 --> 00:18:00.765
this man of God.

391
00:18:00.785 --> 00:18:04.045
And so, uh, in fact, throughout this, uh, story,

392
00:18:04.065 --> 00:18:06.725
you see the servant being the wise one,

393
00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:09.815
and not Saul, look at verse six.

394
00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:13.175
But he, this is Saul's servant said to him, behold,

395
00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:14.775
there's a man of God in this city,

396
00:18:15.115 --> 00:18:16.775
and he's a man who's held in honor,

397
00:18:17.115 --> 00:18:18.695
and all that he says comes true.

398
00:18:18.915 --> 00:18:20.455
So let's go there

399
00:18:20.595 --> 00:18:23.055
and perhaps he can tell us the way we, he we should go.

400
00:18:23.995 --> 00:18:27.495
And so the man turned out to be Samuel, the prophet,

401
00:18:27.595 --> 00:18:30.495
and this was a divine surprise appointment.

402
00:18:30.595 --> 00:18:35.215
See, God, uh, Samuel, uh, was, had been warned the day

403
00:18:35.215 --> 00:18:36.655
before that Saul was coming.

404
00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:41.135
So you see God arranging this surprise divine appointment.

405
00:18:41.315 --> 00:18:42.335
But you see Saul saying,

406
00:18:42.535 --> 00:18:43.775
I don't know if we should go or not.

407
00:18:43.955 --> 00:18:46.175
And dad's probably worried about us. We should get back.

408
00:18:46.385 --> 00:18:48.215
Verse 16. Now, the day

409
00:18:48.215 --> 00:18:51.095
before Saul came, the Lord had revealed to Samuel,

410
00:18:51.695 --> 00:18:53.335
tomorrow about this time, I will send you

411
00:18:53.335 --> 00:18:55.015
to a man from the land of Benjamin.

412
00:18:56.035 --> 00:18:57.055
He knows who this is.

413
00:18:58.785 --> 00:19:01.035
Saul doesn't know who this is, but God knows who this is.

414
00:19:01.035 --> 00:19:02.155
And now he's selling Samuel,

415
00:19:03.385 --> 00:19:05.605
you shall anoint him to be Prince.

416
00:19:06.265 --> 00:19:09.205
Now, the the Hebrew word for prince, there is a unique word.

417
00:19:09.225 --> 00:19:13.125
It can also mean ruler and leader, but this ruler

418
00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:15.125
and leader is to be over my people Israel.

419
00:19:15.545 --> 00:19:18.205
He shall save my people from the hand of the Philistines.

420
00:19:18.595 --> 00:19:23.545
Very key phrase for I have seen my people

421
00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:26.885
because their cry has come to me.

422
00:19:28.065 --> 00:19:29.865
I wanna talk about clear direction.

423
00:19:30.005 --> 00:19:34.665
Now in contrast to confusing, confusing distractions,

424
00:19:35.525 --> 00:19:39.305
the God who sees one of the earliest names of God is El Roy,

425
00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:42.985
which means he, the God who sees,

426
00:19:43.335 --> 00:19:45.465
also hears the cries of his people.

427
00:19:45.765 --> 00:19:48.465
And so Samuel is ready to anoint Saul

428
00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:49.625
as Israel's first leader.

429
00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:51.385
And then Saul and Samuel finally

430
00:19:51.475 --> 00:19:52.785
meets Saul, doesn't recognize him.

431
00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:53.785
Is anybody surprised?

432
00:19:55.245 --> 00:19:56.505
And Samuel tells Saul,

433
00:19:56.505 --> 00:19:58.225
don't worry about the donkeys they've been found.

434
00:19:58.335 --> 00:20:02.545
This is really not about the donkeys. Okay?

435
00:20:04.865 --> 00:20:06.485
And then he surprises Saul

436
00:20:07.325 --> 00:20:09.465
and he treats him like a future king.

437
00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.625
He invites him to a banquet

438
00:20:11.625 --> 00:20:14.105
and he gives him the best part of the sacrifice.

439
00:20:14.405 --> 00:20:15.785
And then he invites him to sleep there,

440
00:20:15.785 --> 00:20:18.065
and he gives him the best place to stay on the roof

441
00:20:18.115 --> 00:20:19.225
where the evening breeze.

442
00:20:19.525 --> 00:20:22.185
And then he personally escorts Saul

443
00:20:22.445 --> 00:20:24.345
and his servant to the edge of town,

444
00:20:24.595 --> 00:20:27.585
which not doesn't happen to a lot of people with Samuel.

445
00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:31.385
And so look at verse 27, as they were going to the outskirts

446
00:20:31.385 --> 00:20:34.265
of the city, Samuel says to Saul, tell the servant

447
00:20:34.285 --> 00:20:35.385
to pass on before us.

448
00:20:36.785 --> 00:20:40.245
And when he'd passed on, stop here for yourself for a while,

449
00:20:40.905 --> 00:20:44.845
and this is another key verse that I may make known to you.

450
00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:46.685
The word of God.

451
00:20:47.075 --> 00:20:50.045
This is where the clear direction comes from.

452
00:20:50.345 --> 00:20:53.885
The God who sees Elroy hears the Christ his people,

453
00:20:54.145 --> 00:20:57.125
and then makes known to them the word of God.

454
00:20:57.555 --> 00:21:00.965
Then Samuel secretly anoints Saul with oil the next day

455
00:21:01.185 --> 00:21:04.245
and officially marks him as Israel's chosen leaders.

456
00:21:04.265 --> 00:21:07.725
So let's look at verse. I mean, uh, chapter 10, God

457
00:21:08.285 --> 00:21:11.005
anoints a king, chapter 10, verse one.

458
00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:14.445
Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head

459
00:21:14.745 --> 00:21:18.405
and kissed him and said, has not the Lord anointed you

460
00:21:18.465 --> 00:21:21.725
to be prince leader ruler over the people Israel?

461
00:21:22.235 --> 00:21:24.245
Well, Saul is not looking for this.

462
00:21:25.355 --> 00:21:28.805
He's just trying to find some donkeys and he can't find him,

463
00:21:28.805 --> 00:21:29.885
and he's ready to go home.

464
00:21:30.305 --> 00:21:32.405
And then the servant says, let's go find this man of God.

465
00:21:32.405 --> 00:21:34.045
He is like, we don't have any bread to give him.

466
00:21:35.005 --> 00:21:38.185
And he's making excuses why God shouldn't use him.

467
00:21:38.185 --> 00:21:39.305
And that's what he does to Samuel.

468
00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:41.305
He is like, I'm from the time of Benjamin.

469
00:21:42.165 --> 00:21:45.265
I'm from the least of the people of the tribe of Benjamin.

470
00:21:47.295 --> 00:21:51.225
But see, you can't make excuses.

471
00:21:52.445 --> 00:21:54.025
If God wants to use you.

472
00:21:54.725 --> 00:21:56.385
God has bigger plans

473
00:21:57.205 --> 00:22:01.065
and our excuses are moot when God has bigger plans.

474
00:22:01.365 --> 00:22:04.145
And just as he turns to leave Samuel, look at

475
00:22:04.145 --> 00:22:05.265
what the text says.

476
00:22:05.525 --> 00:22:07.465
And never forget this verse, verse nine,

477
00:22:07.615 --> 00:22:10.225
when he turned his back to leave Samuel,

478
00:22:11.085 --> 00:22:13.025
God gave him another

479
00:22:13.435 --> 00:22:16.195
heart, a new heart.

480
00:22:17.215 --> 00:22:20.395
The condition of your heart is an enormous factor

481
00:22:20.695 --> 00:22:21.755
for God to do his work.

482
00:22:22.435 --> 00:22:25.235
A pure heart, a trusting heart, a humble heart,

483
00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:27.635
a grateful heart, a forgiving heart.

484
00:22:27.925 --> 00:22:30.915
These are the heart conditions that only God can give.

485
00:22:31.375 --> 00:22:33.155
And God gave him a new heart.

486
00:22:33.155 --> 00:22:35.035
And you're saying, well, I want a new heart.

487
00:22:35.085 --> 00:22:36.755
How's a guy get a new heart like that?

488
00:22:37.265 --> 00:22:40.835
Well, how does a guy go from being somebody who's not

489
00:22:40.835 --> 00:22:42.675
that good of a shepherd, someone who kind

490
00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:46.115
of hides re from responsibility, someone who shows a, a,

491
00:22:46.395 --> 00:22:48.395
a general malaise and an aptist.

492
00:22:48.655 --> 00:22:51.275
How does they, how do you go from that to someone

493
00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:55.555
who God can trust to lead and protect his chosen people?

494
00:22:55.785 --> 00:22:58.435
Well, here is precisely how it happens.

495
00:22:58.645 --> 00:23:02.995
Verse six, then the spirit of the Lord will rush on you

496
00:23:03.575 --> 00:23:05.075
and you will prophesy with them

497
00:23:05.735 --> 00:23:08.035
and be turned into another man.

498
00:23:08.665 --> 00:23:11.885
So God gives you a new heart because of your new heart.

499
00:23:11.945 --> 00:23:13.045
Now you're a new person.

500
00:23:13.865 --> 00:23:15.525
God changes the hearts of people

501
00:23:15.525 --> 00:23:17.165
through the power of the Holy Spirit.

502
00:23:17.745 --> 00:23:20.405
One of our core values is desperate

503
00:23:20.405 --> 00:23:22.165
dependence on the Holy Spirit.

504
00:23:22.465 --> 00:23:25.645
And listen to all the ways that the Holy Spirit is able

505
00:23:25.645 --> 00:23:26.805
to make you into a new person.

506
00:23:27.425 --> 00:23:30.845
In John 16, the Holy Spirit serves as the divine instructor

507
00:23:31.225 --> 00:23:32.565
and guide you into the truth.

508
00:23:33.065 --> 00:23:35.805
In one John two, the Holy Spirit anoints you

509
00:23:35.805 --> 00:23:37.565
and teaches you about all things.

510
00:23:38.385 --> 00:23:41.325
In John 14, the Holy Spirit teaches you all things

511
00:23:41.345 --> 00:23:45.005
and reminds you of everything Jesus has told you.

512
00:23:46.115 --> 00:23:48.335
And in Acts 10, the Holy Spirit speaks to you

513
00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:50.375
and directs you the right way.

514
00:23:51.385 --> 00:23:54.405
And in two Corinthians three, in one Peter three 18,

515
00:23:54.465 --> 00:23:55.885
the Holy Spirit, by the way,

516
00:23:55.885 --> 00:23:57.725
before I wanna read this, I'm gonna say something, okay?

517
00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:00.085
Uh, one of my jobs is try

518
00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:01.925
to turn this into a disciple making culture.

519
00:24:02.305 --> 00:24:05.285
And I've encouraged many of you to take on the role

520
00:24:05.285 --> 00:24:09.085
of a mentor and, uh, maybe, um, micro group leader

521
00:24:09.105 --> 00:24:10.365
or maybe a CG leader.

522
00:24:10.705 --> 00:24:12.325
And you know, the number one excuse,

523
00:24:12.325 --> 00:24:13.725
and this isn't just Henderson Hills,

524
00:24:14.025 --> 00:24:15.405
the number one excuse in all

525
00:24:15.405 --> 00:24:17.915
of Christianity is like, I'm just not ready.

526
00:24:18.775 --> 00:24:19.795
I'm just not prepared.

527
00:24:20.535 --> 00:24:24.475
And I just wanna say, I agree with you 100%, neither am I,

528
00:24:24.475 --> 00:24:27.515
because it is the Holy Spirit that produces life

529
00:24:27.735 --> 00:24:30.635
and is able to make you competent to minister.

530
00:24:31.065 --> 00:24:35.755
It's his work, not my work. It's his work, not your work.

531
00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:40.835
And then Samuel gives Saul this newly anointed king,

532
00:24:41.115 --> 00:24:44.555
a series of signs that will serve to confirm that

533
00:24:44.555 --> 00:24:45.555
what he's saying is true.

534
00:24:45.975 --> 00:24:47.155
You'll meet two men

535
00:24:47.255 --> 00:24:49.435
and they'll tell you the lost donkeys have been found.

536
00:24:50.215 --> 00:24:52.715
You'll meet three men, they'll have three goats

537
00:24:52.715 --> 00:24:53.955
and three loaves of bread and the

538
00:24:53.955 --> 00:24:55.115
skin of wine, and you're out of bread.

539
00:24:55.215 --> 00:24:57.235
And they'll offer your bread and you'll take it.

540
00:24:59.065 --> 00:25:00.685
And then there will be prophets

541
00:25:01.025 --> 00:25:03.645
and they'll be carrying various musical instruments.

542
00:25:03.905 --> 00:25:08.085
And the power of the Holy Spirit will come on you, Saul,

543
00:25:08.225 --> 00:25:11.285
and you will prophesy as if you were one of the prophets.

544
00:25:11.505 --> 00:25:15.405
And suddenly, Saul finds himself caught up in his new role

545
00:25:15.635 --> 00:25:19.965
with a new, a new man, with a new heart, with a new power.

546
00:25:20.265 --> 00:25:24.925
And despite his doubts, God is at work in Saul changing him.

547
00:25:25.775 --> 00:25:27.315
And now we have a new king.

548
00:25:28.755 --> 00:25:31.975
And later Samuel calls the people together

549
00:25:32.035 --> 00:25:33.135
to introduce the king.

550
00:25:33.135 --> 00:25:34.375
It's at mitzvah. Lots

551
00:25:34.375 --> 00:25:36.375
of important things have happened in mitzvah,

552
00:25:36.555 --> 00:25:37.855
and this is no different.

553
00:25:37.995 --> 00:25:42.895
Samuel reminds them, by the way, that by asking for a king,

554
00:25:42.895 --> 00:25:45.335
you're essentially rejecting God as your king,

555
00:25:46.205 --> 00:25:47.505
but they still wanted a king.

556
00:25:47.525 --> 00:25:49.625
And so they held a lottery for a king.

557
00:25:50.095 --> 00:25:51.225
This is an election year.

558
00:25:51.285 --> 00:25:52.625
I'm not suggesting anything different,

559
00:25:54.435 --> 00:25:56.655
but Saul is chosen by lot,

560
00:26:00.565 --> 00:26:01.785
but he's so anxious.

561
00:26:02.085 --> 00:26:04.225
And by the way, let's give Saul a break here for a minute.

562
00:26:04.615 --> 00:26:06.465
When you first read this, you think, you know what,

563
00:26:06.615 --> 00:26:08.225
what a milk toast.

564
00:26:10.205 --> 00:26:13.985
But Saul, I mean, but Samuel has said you don't want a king.

565
00:26:13.985 --> 00:26:15.105
And they're like, yes, we do. And he is like,

566
00:26:15.105 --> 00:26:16.745
he's gonna take everything you have your son's,

567
00:26:16.745 --> 00:26:18.705
your daughters, your money or whatever, and

568
00:26:18.765 --> 00:26:20.865
and there's like, Hey, Saul, you get to be that king.

569
00:26:21.325 --> 00:26:23.745
I'm gonna hide in the luggage too, right?

570
00:26:24.605 --> 00:26:28.025
That's not what happens when, when they identify

571
00:26:28.055 --> 00:26:31.705
that it's Saul and he's hidden among the leg l luggage.

572
00:26:32.845 --> 00:26:34.495
He's already been anointed as king,

573
00:26:34.495 --> 00:26:37.215
and he's already been confirmed through these signs.

574
00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:39.295
And he should have been confident in

575
00:26:39.395 --> 00:26:40.415
God after his anointing.

576
00:26:40.475 --> 00:26:42.655
But, but he looks fearful and insecure.

577
00:26:42.835 --> 00:26:44.845
And when I say, I need you to be a mentor,

578
00:26:45.185 --> 00:26:46.645
or I need you to find a mentor,

579
00:26:47.065 --> 00:26:49.565
or I need you to be involved in a micro group, you are like,

580
00:26:49.625 --> 00:26:53.995
eh, sounds a little too and fill in the blank.

581
00:26:54.075 --> 00:26:56.955
I don't really care what the excuse is. Okay?

582
00:26:58.015 --> 00:26:59.315
We are the exact same way.

583
00:27:00.015 --> 00:27:03.035
We, we sometimes take a step back

584
00:27:03.075 --> 00:27:07.235
and say, I don't think God could use me just like Saul did.

585
00:27:07.815 --> 00:27:09.195
But God gave him a new heart.

586
00:27:10.165 --> 00:27:13.225
God made him a new person, and God made him a new king.

587
00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:15.785
And when the people saw him, they were thrilled

588
00:27:15.885 --> 00:27:18.225
and they shouted, long live the king.

589
00:27:18.965 --> 00:27:23.545
And despite this amazing moments, moments,

590
00:27:23.545 --> 00:27:26.225
this is not your typical royal royal coronation.

591
00:27:26.285 --> 00:27:28.545
And I think that some of Saul's reluctance

592
00:27:28.885 --> 00:27:33.105
and some of his, maybe even spiritual ineptness

593
00:27:33.765 --> 00:27:35.985
is a sign of struggles ahead.

594
00:27:36.085 --> 00:27:38.465
But for now, Israel has their king.

595
00:27:38.935 --> 00:27:41.345
Well, what I want us to do now is they're gonna change the

596
00:27:41.345 --> 00:27:44.385
sermon from, from the text through the application.

597
00:27:45.245 --> 00:27:47.665
And so, uh, this isn't just a history

598
00:27:47.685 --> 00:27:49.545
of Israel's new king Saul.

599
00:27:49.775 --> 00:27:53.305
This isn't just an introduction into the mon monarchy, okay?

600
00:27:53.495 --> 00:27:57.185
This is not about Saul or Samuel or even Israel.

601
00:27:57.375 --> 00:28:00.505
This is a story first and foremost about God.

602
00:28:00.765 --> 00:28:03.705
And that's what we should do when we read the scripture, not

603
00:28:03.705 --> 00:28:05.065
as about what does this say about me,

604
00:28:05.065 --> 00:28:06.425
but what does this say about God?

605
00:28:06.725 --> 00:28:09.545
And I promised you when we started that if you would listen

606
00:28:09.605 --> 00:28:10.665
for 25 minutes,

607
00:28:10.665 --> 00:28:13.745
that God would absolutely change your perspective,

608
00:28:14.015 --> 00:28:16.185
that you would be renewed in your mind.

609
00:28:16.205 --> 00:28:17.265
And the first thing I want you

610
00:28:17.265 --> 00:28:19.985
to know is about God's subtle ways.

611
00:28:21.445 --> 00:28:25.085
God's ways are very subtle. Ask Gideon, he wasn't in this.

612
00:28:25.105 --> 00:28:26.485
He wasn't in that. He was in the what?

613
00:28:26.485 --> 00:28:30.405
The still small voice.

614
00:28:31.925 --> 00:28:34.545
God can often be very low key and gentle,

615
00:28:35.735 --> 00:28:38.635
but he's the guiding hand be behind everything

616
00:28:38.635 --> 00:28:40.275
that happens in these two chapters.

617
00:28:40.855 --> 00:28:43.155
Saul's mission to find the donkeys is not

618
00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:44.275
about lost donkeys.

619
00:28:44.465 --> 00:28:48.595
It's about the very hand of God leading Saul to Samuel.

620
00:28:49.215 --> 00:28:53.355
And so Saul, do you think you might be chasing lost donkeys?

621
00:28:53.355 --> 00:28:56.275
No. It's God preparing you for something else.

622
00:28:56.495 --> 00:28:58.275
So I just wanna say, Phil

623
00:28:59.255 --> 00:29:01.035
and anyone listening to Phil today,

624
00:29:01.175 --> 00:29:03.795
do you think you might be chasing lost donkeys?

625
00:29:04.775 --> 00:29:08.555
No. This might be God preparing you for something else.

626
00:29:09.015 --> 00:29:11.155
You're not just going through the up motions.

627
00:29:11.655 --> 00:29:13.515
You can, you can find fulfillment

628
00:29:13.515 --> 00:29:16.555
and meaning during your own donkey search.

629
00:29:17.295 --> 00:29:19.115
In fact, today at lunch, uh,

630
00:29:19.505 --> 00:29:21.835
this would be a great opportunity to say, Hey, what, what,

631
00:29:22.055 --> 00:29:23.435
what's your lost donkey deal?

632
00:29:25.225 --> 00:29:26.725
And to have a conversation as to

633
00:29:26.725 --> 00:29:28.645
what God might be doing because he's subtle.

634
00:29:29.505 --> 00:29:32.365
And it is in the, uh, con, it is within the confines

635
00:29:32.365 --> 00:29:34.765
of a relational community that people are able to say, well,

636
00:29:34.765 --> 00:29:37.005
I think this is what God might be doing in your life.

637
00:29:38.285 --> 00:29:40.705
Why? Because number two, God is at work in the world.

638
00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:42.805
He is still at work in the world today.

639
00:29:43.225 --> 00:29:45.445
And sometimes it's difficult for us to see this

640
00:29:45.505 --> 00:29:48.125
or believe this when we're sitting in the line waiting

641
00:29:48.225 --> 00:29:51.405
for our kids or when we're sitting at the left turn, no,

642
00:29:51.465 --> 00:29:52.765
no left turn lines when we're

643
00:29:52.765 --> 00:29:53.885
sitting to trying to make a left turn.

644
00:29:53.885 --> 00:29:55.445
It's just not happening. What are you gonna do?

645
00:29:55.445 --> 00:29:59.805
You can just sit there and go, yeah, you can do that.

646
00:30:01.045 --> 00:30:04.415
Or you can use this as an opportunity to say,

647
00:30:04.415 --> 00:30:05.535
what is God trying to teach me?

648
00:30:06.445 --> 00:30:08.895
What if for the rest of the school year you prayed

649
00:30:08.895 --> 00:30:10.655
for your kids while you were sitting on waiting for them,

650
00:30:11.625 --> 00:30:13.475
what, instead of sitting there, where are they?

651
00:30:13.595 --> 00:30:14.835
I told them to meet me right here.

652
00:30:15.575 --> 00:30:17.675
And they're just like, there's, I'm just kidding.

653
00:30:19.495 --> 00:30:21.885
Don't, don't, don't waste that opportunity.

654
00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:23.365
What's your lost donkey story?

655
00:30:23.365 --> 00:30:26.085
Because God is still, he's still at work in the world

656
00:30:26.105 --> 00:30:27.445
and his work is not finished.

657
00:30:27.665 --> 00:30:30.805
And he loves involving those who he loves

658
00:30:31.505 --> 00:30:32.765
to accomplish his work.

659
00:30:33.385 --> 00:30:35.205
And he, Saul is teaching us.

660
00:30:35.345 --> 00:30:38.565
He can choose anyone he wants to progress his plan.

661
00:30:39.185 --> 00:30:41.205
You're not just wasting space.

662
00:30:41.745 --> 00:30:44.365
You can be involved in God's work

663
00:30:44.585 --> 00:30:47.245
and what you're doing for God matters.

664
00:30:48.385 --> 00:30:50.565
And I need you to look for surprising appointments.

665
00:30:51.605 --> 00:30:54.385
That's number three, God surprising appointments.

666
00:30:54.745 --> 00:30:56.545
Remember when the unnamed servant insisted

667
00:30:56.545 --> 00:30:58.105
that they find the man of God?

668
00:30:58.405 --> 00:31:00.225
And Saul said, we don't have anything to give him.

669
00:31:00.245 --> 00:31:02.105
And and he seemed to be avoiding the meeting,

670
00:31:02.165 --> 00:31:06.425
but it was in this meeting that was orchestrated by God.

671
00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:09.825
Remember the day before God said to Samuel,

672
00:31:10.045 --> 00:31:12.025
I'm sending somebody, I'm Vegemite to meet you.

673
00:31:12.645 --> 00:31:14.625
God will bring people to you

674
00:31:14.645 --> 00:31:16.505
to help equip you for his service.

675
00:31:17.395 --> 00:31:20.125
Sometimes in a community group, sometimes in a micro group,

676
00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:21.205
sometimes in mentorship,

677
00:31:21.355 --> 00:31:25.105
sometimes walking down the street, God can do that.

678
00:31:25.855 --> 00:31:27.275
And then lastly, I want you to see

679
00:31:27.275 --> 00:31:29.915
that God's spirit is changing lives.

680
00:31:30.415 --> 00:31:32.275
The Holy Spirit is changing lives.

681
00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:34.915
Saul serves as an example for us.

682
00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:36.795
I wanna give you a new heart

683
00:31:37.215 --> 00:31:38.915
and I wanna make you a new person.

684
00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:42.595
And God's gift to Saul was change.

685
00:31:42.895 --> 00:31:46.635
He was transformed by the Holy Spirit, able now to lead

686
00:31:46.815 --> 00:31:49.195
and to be strong and battle against the Philistines,

687
00:31:49.335 --> 00:31:50.555
to hear the word of God

688
00:31:50.735 --> 00:31:53.915
and to follow the instructions from God's prophet Samuel.

689
00:31:55.235 --> 00:31:57.935
God changes lives through the ministry of the Holy Spirit,

690
00:31:58.955 --> 00:32:00.885
turning Saul into a different person.

691
00:32:01.985 --> 00:32:03.925
God uses circumstances

692
00:32:04.225 --> 00:32:07.925
and people to accomplish his purposes in the work

693
00:32:08.065 --> 00:32:10.845
and in the lives of people, and transforms them.

694
00:32:10.985 --> 00:32:14.445
He changed them. He makes them ready for his service,

695
00:32:14.915 --> 00:32:16.245
sometimes subtly.

696
00:32:16.985 --> 00:32:19.125
But God is at work in the lives of people.

697
00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:21.965
Is he changing you this morning?

698
00:32:23.045 --> 00:32:24.275
Don't be duped into thinking.

699
00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:25.955
I'm just going through the motions.

700
00:32:26.865 --> 00:32:29.365
You don't have to ask yourself what's the point?

701
00:32:29.665 --> 00:32:30.725
We know the point.

702
00:32:32.465 --> 00:32:34.165
Or this little boy who grew up in Western

703
00:32:35.085 --> 00:32:36.205
Oklahoma, his name is Brad.

704
00:32:37.285 --> 00:32:40.845
And Brad Clay used his love for the outdoors

705
00:32:41.505 --> 00:32:43.885
and his love for Jesus to minister

706
00:32:43.885 --> 00:32:45.245
to the students in his church.

707
00:32:45.625 --> 00:32:47.565
And the dads couldn't stay away.

708
00:32:48.225 --> 00:32:50.325
And so the dads started being involved,

709
00:32:50.345 --> 00:32:52.365
and it went from a student ministry thing now

710
00:32:52.465 --> 00:32:53.925
to an entire church thing,

711
00:32:54.185 --> 00:32:56.765
and he called it Final Descent Outdoors.

712
00:32:57.155 --> 00:33:00.045
It's a ministry which was born inside

713
00:33:00.065 --> 00:33:02.485
of a little boy searching for donkeys.

714
00:33:02.485 --> 00:33:06.565
Okay? I made that part up into a national television show,

715
00:33:06.565 --> 00:33:09.445
which is in 40 million homes in North America.

716
00:33:09.905 --> 00:33:12.485
And Brad will be our keynote speaker on Thursday night at

717
00:33:12.485 --> 00:33:14.605
the men's ministry tailgate at 6:00 PM

718
00:33:15.025 --> 00:33:16.125
You should plan to be there.

719
00:33:16.225 --> 00:33:21.205
You see, this is an example of the work of God and church.

720
00:33:21.555 --> 00:33:25.525
Hear me. God is at work that Jesus' death

721
00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:28.725
and resurrection, they display God's plan for the world,

722
00:33:28.945 --> 00:33:30.365
and his kingdom has arrived.

723
00:33:30.585 --> 00:33:34.845
And the new king who lived a life, died his death

724
00:33:34.985 --> 00:33:37.685
and resurrected on our behalf, wants us to be

725
00:33:38.205 --> 00:33:39.365
involved in his ministry.

726
00:33:39.945 --> 00:33:41.725
The Lord Jesus is our king.

727
00:33:42.665 --> 00:33:46.285
And the gospel says, believe and trust and repent

728
00:33:46.505 --> 00:33:47.885
and submit to King Jesus,

729
00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:50.605
because those who submit to him will live

730
00:33:50.605 --> 00:33:52.685
for him for eternity.

731
00:33:53.715 --> 00:33:56.855
And God's mission declares that Jesus who died

732
00:33:56.855 --> 00:34:00.545
and rose again in order to save us, will help us

733
00:34:00.845 --> 00:34:03.105
and through us set the world, right?

734
00:34:04.495 --> 00:34:07.655
Let's join Him in this mission. Let's pray.

735
00:34:08.515 --> 00:34:09.815
Father, we thank you so much

736
00:34:10.245 --> 00:34:12.295
that you give us examples like this all

737
00:34:12.295 --> 00:34:15.605
through the Old Testament of people who are not prepared

738
00:34:15.605 --> 00:34:18.045
to do something great for you, but you use them anyway,

739
00:34:18.305 --> 00:34:20.485
and you change them through the power of the Holy Spirit.

740
00:34:21.005 --> 00:34:22.765
I pray, Lord, that through these songs

741
00:34:22.825 --> 00:34:23.925
and through these prayers

742
00:34:23.945 --> 00:34:26.445
and through our willingness to submit and repent,

743
00:34:26.445 --> 00:34:28.165
and to fall in line with what you want for us,

744
00:34:28.165 --> 00:34:29.725
that lives will be changed

745
00:34:30.445 --> 00:34:32.565
starting this morning for your glory.

746
00:34:33.025 --> 00:34:34.405
In Jesus' name, amen.
