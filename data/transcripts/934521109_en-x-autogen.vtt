WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:00.575
Yeah.

2
00:00:00.805 --> 00:00:02.095
Amen. What a blessing. Amen.

3
00:00:03.845 --> 00:00:07.095
Yeah, it's, uh, it's always encouraging to see

4
00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:09.295
how God's been at work among us for the last 60 years.

5
00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:10.495
We're celebrating that this month,

6
00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:12.375
but we also believe that God wants

7
00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:16.095
to do even more abundantly than he has in the past,

8
00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:17.575
over the next 60 plus years.

9
00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:19.215
Uh, so we're looking forward

10
00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:20.295
to that and trusting him forward.

11
00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:21.895
If I haven't had the privilege of meeting you yet,

12
00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:24.655
my name's John, one of the pastors here, love to meet you.

13
00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:28.215
Uh, we'd love to get to know you as we can.

14
00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:30.415
And so we're studying parts of the book

15
00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:32.495
of one Corinthians right now, just looking at the idea

16
00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:35.655
of faithfulness, both God's faithfulness to us,

17
00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:39.415
but then also how that enables us to be faithful to him.

18
00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:41.335
And so take your copy of God's word.

19
00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:43.255
Turn there with me if you can.

20
00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.975
One Corinthians chapter one, the start of it.

21
00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:48.575
First nine verses is where we're gonna be today.

22
00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:51.215
One Corinthians one, one through nine.

23
00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:57.945
As you find it, as you settle in to that, I, I, I want us

24
00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.865
to do a little thought experiment together to get started.

25
00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:03.385
I was talking to a pastor friend of mine this week

26
00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:06.105
and uh, he had a great idea similar to this, but,

27
00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:08.305
but what I want, I want, I want us to do, I want you

28
00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:12.745
to do is, is to examine your life and,

29
00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:16.265
and think about like your, your past,

30
00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:20.465
your present, and your future.

31
00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:25.115
And so think, think about your past,

32
00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:28.715
like the choices you've made, uh, the sins you've committed,

33
00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:30.515
failures, successes.

34
00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:32.835
But just think primarily about the way you view your past

35
00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:36.435
and then then your present, your circumstances today, like

36
00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:37.875
where you're at in life, what's going on,

37
00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:41.795
what you're experiencing, and then think about your future.

38
00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:46.035
So just think about those three sections of life.

39
00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:48.395
But in doing so, here's what I want us to start with.

40
00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:52.995
I want you to consider how you would think about your past,

41
00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:54.715
your present, and your future.

42
00:01:56.635 --> 00:01:59.815
Yet in doing so, you would remove the faithfulness of God.

43
00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:05.755
In other words, how would we view our past, our present,

44
00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:09.035
and our future if God was not faithful?

45
00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:13.625
Now, here's how I would answer that.

46
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:18.505
At least looking back at my past

47
00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:22.305
without God's faithfulness, it'd be a lot of regret

48
00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:27.435
over choices I've made, sins I've committed, habits I had,

49
00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:32.795
I'd also be defined by what other people think about me

50
00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:34.595
or say about me or have done.

51
00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:39.445
To me. If I think about my present circumstances

52
00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:41.805
without God's faithfulness, I,

53
00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:44.685
I'd be disappointed I didn't have more.

54
00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:48.685
I'd also be really sad that not everybody loves me

55
00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:53.355
and that would really sway and and change my life.

56
00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:58.685
And then looking to the future without a faithful God,

57
00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:01.355
how would I view my future?

58
00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:05.835
Well, it'd be a lot of fear over what could happen

59
00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:07.635
to me or to my family.

60
00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:10.075
Even thinking about death,

61
00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:11.755
I would wonder what, what even happens.

62
00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:14.235
I would be so afraid of that moment.

63
00:03:19.145 --> 00:03:20.925
So what would change then

64
00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:25.185
when we do include the faithfulness of God?

65
00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:32.225
Like how does God being faithful change the way

66
00:03:32.225 --> 00:03:35.105
that we view our past, our present, and our future?

67
00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:39.185
And that's what we're gonna see today.

68
00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:44.445
This reality that we can hold fast the confession

69
00:03:44.505 --> 00:03:48.925
of our hope without wavering for he

70
00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:51.045
who promised is faithful,

71
00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:56.965
that we can hold fast to this confession of hope

72
00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:02.055
because he who promised is faithful.

73
00:04:03.905 --> 00:04:05.685
That's what one Corinthians one, one

74
00:04:05.685 --> 00:04:06.965
through nine will show us.

75
00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:11.085
It'll show us God's faithfulness, past, present, and future

76
00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:14.095
and how that changes our lives today.

77
00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:19.985
Let me read it. Paul called

78
00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:22.545
by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus

79
00:04:23.365 --> 00:04:27.625
and our brother Sese to the church of God that is in Corinth

80
00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:30.705
to those sanctified in Christ Jesus called

81
00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:32.185
to be saints together with all those

82
00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:33.905
who in every place call upon the name

83
00:04:33.905 --> 00:04:36.265
of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord

84
00:04:36.265 --> 00:04:40.465
and ours grace to you and peace from God, our Father

85
00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:41.785
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

86
00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:45.985
I give thanks to my God always for you

87
00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:47.345
because of the grace of God

88
00:04:47.345 --> 00:04:48.865
that was given you in Christ Jesus,

89
00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:52.585
that in every way you were enriched in Him, in all speech,

90
00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:54.465
in all knowledge, even

91
00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:58.625
as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you, so

92
00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:02.225
that you're not lacking in any gift as you wait

93
00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:04.345
for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ

94
00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:08.865
who will sustain you to the end guiltless in the day

95
00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:10.185
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

96
00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:16.885
God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship

97
00:05:16.885 --> 00:05:18.605
of His son, Jesus Christ,

98
00:05:18.865 --> 00:05:22.535
our Lord God.

99
00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:25.335
We need you to open our eyes and our minds

100
00:05:25.335 --> 00:05:27.415
and our hearts to see what you want us

101
00:05:27.415 --> 00:05:30.735
to see today from this passage, from your word

102
00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:34.825
for us to see our past, present,

103
00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:39.375
future from your perspective, to be doers

104
00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:40.655
of the word, not hearers only.

105
00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:45.725
God, we know around the world right now, there's a lot

106
00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:48.635
that is troubling.

107
00:05:50.745 --> 00:05:52.355
Pray for peace in the Middle East

108
00:05:55.515 --> 00:05:56.815
And it can create fear.

109
00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.845
So God, I pray that even today in this passage,

110
00:06:02.025 --> 00:06:05.775
you would remind us of your faithfulness, your goodness,

111
00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:09.215
and we would be able to trust you more.

112
00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:14.945
Thank you. God, help us. Holy Spirit illuminate this to us.

113
00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:17.825
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

114
00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:22.475
So first, let's look back to our pasts,

115
00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:27.595
how God was faithful there using one Corinthians one

116
00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.115
to answer the first question that we have.

117
00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:31.475
What has the Lord Jesus Christ done?

118
00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:34.905
What has Jesus done?

119
00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:38.505
What has God done looking at our past?

120
00:06:38.535 --> 00:06:40.985
Well, first we saw here in this passage,

121
00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:44.185
he has sanctified us, right?

122
00:06:44.185 --> 00:06:45.825
That's the first thing we can see right away,

123
00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:47.905
that he has sanctified us.

124
00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:50.825
That Paul wrote this letter to the church in Corinth

125
00:06:51.165 --> 00:06:55.665
and then he calls them to those sanctified in Christ Jesus.

126
00:06:56.535 --> 00:06:58.865
That word sanctified means made holy.

127
00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:03.385
It means set apart from the regular, the normal.

128
00:07:03.525 --> 00:07:06.585
He even added the phrase called to be saints.

129
00:07:08.365 --> 00:07:10.945
Not some like super class of Christian

130
00:07:10.945 --> 00:07:12.705
that gets a stained glass window made out of you.

131
00:07:12.705 --> 00:07:14.305
Like that's not what we're talking about. Saints.

132
00:07:14.305 --> 00:07:19.225
We're talking about those who are holy ones in God, right?

133
00:07:19.335 --> 00:07:21.385
Holy ones a saint.

134
00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:24.455
What he's talking about in other words is

135
00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:28.615
for those God has drawn to salvation, anyone

136
00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:30.695
who calls upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

137
00:07:30.755 --> 00:07:33.255
he has set apart, has made holy

138
00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:39.235
as a Christian, he's made them acceptable.

139
00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:42.675
He's made them able to be in his presence.

140
00:07:42.855 --> 00:07:47.665
Now where as a sinner we can't, but now as a saint we can.

141
00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:51.705
But notice the sphere in which this happens.

142
00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:55.385
He says, those sanctified in Christ Jesus,

143
00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:58.745
he's not just saying those sanctified, poof, it happens.

144
00:07:58.885 --> 00:08:00.265
He just kinda randomly does it.

145
00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:03.665
It's sanctified in Christ Jesus.

146
00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:09.015
Paul showed here, it's through Christ that we are made holy

147
00:08:09.675 --> 00:08:10.735
not our own actions.

148
00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:15.575
It's his perfection that counts us as perfect.

149
00:08:15.845 --> 00:08:18.815
When we believe it, it's his blood

150
00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:21.655
that cleanses us completely to make us

151
00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:24.725
holy in Christ.

152
00:08:24.785 --> 00:08:26.525
In fact, nine times

153
00:08:27.345 --> 00:08:30.165
in just these nine verses the name Jesus Christ shows up

154
00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:33.395
like Paul can't do it enough.

155
00:08:33.495 --> 00:08:35.435
He can't say it enough that this is the point.

156
00:08:36.305 --> 00:08:41.095
It's in Christ. It's all about him. He is our salvation.

157
00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:43.895
He is our hope. Don't miss that.

158
00:08:46.445 --> 00:08:47.985
But just think for a second what that means.

159
00:08:49.015 --> 00:08:52.095
That if we're sanctified in Christ Jesus, what that means,

160
00:08:52.235 --> 00:08:55.135
the tense of sanctified means it already

161
00:08:55.345 --> 00:08:56.365
has been accomplished.

162
00:08:57.935 --> 00:09:01.865
It's already happened. This is not a future. This is a past.

163
00:09:03.095 --> 00:09:05.105
What that means is that if you're in Christ,

164
00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:07.065
you are already holy.

165
00:09:08.175 --> 00:09:09.715
You're already a saint.

166
00:09:12.915 --> 00:09:15.495
That's how our faithful God sees you Christian.

167
00:09:17.445 --> 00:09:20.995
I think about that. That's

168
00:09:20.995 --> 00:09:24.155
how our faithful God sees you, meaning all those things

169
00:09:24.155 --> 00:09:25.875
that I regret about my past.

170
00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:32.965
He has exchanged it for forgiveness.

171
00:09:35.085 --> 00:09:37.335
He's exchanged the regret with forgiveness

172
00:09:39.075 --> 00:09:41.405
because I am sanctified.

173
00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:44.525
I have been sanctified in Christ.

174
00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:48.475
So let's live differently because of that, right?

175
00:09:48.475 --> 00:09:51.195
Like let's think differently about our past.

176
00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:52.435
But look what else he's done.

177
00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:55.995
He's not only sanctified us, he has enriched us.

178
00:09:56.255 --> 00:09:59.515
It says Paul's writing to this church

179
00:09:59.575 --> 00:10:02.715
and he says he's enriched you.

180
00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:05.755
Church, like verses four through seven, this grace

181
00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:10.315
of God has enriched the Corinthian believers

182
00:10:10.415 --> 00:10:12.595
and he talking about spiritual gifts.

183
00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:15.595
They've been given these gifts.

184
00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:17.795
It's, it's a enriching kind of idea.

185
00:10:20.405 --> 00:10:22.545
In fact, it's the same word. This gift.

186
00:10:22.645 --> 00:10:26.265
And grace has the same root word in Greek chorus

187
00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:30.345
that the grace is a gift and the gift is God's grace.

188
00:10:30.445 --> 00:10:31.745
It works together.

189
00:10:32.085 --> 00:10:34.305
But notice Paul wrote in verse five,

190
00:10:34.485 --> 00:10:36.705
God had enriched them in every way.

191
00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:41.555
He's saying God had given them all the gifts they needed.

192
00:10:41.945 --> 00:10:45.435
This church didn't lack anything that God wanted them

193
00:10:45.435 --> 00:10:47.155
to have for the purpose he had for them.

194
00:10:49.465 --> 00:10:51.935
Which later he goes on in chapter 12 here

195
00:10:52.915 --> 00:10:55.335
to talk about the church that he's referring

196
00:10:55.335 --> 00:10:56.895
to here being the body of Christ.

197
00:10:58.255 --> 00:11:00.225
That there's all these different parts members

198
00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:02.585
that have all been given different functions,

199
00:11:02.585 --> 00:11:06.265
different gifts, we might say, for the good of the whole,

200
00:11:06.285 --> 00:11:08.025
for the good of the other parts,

201
00:11:08.095 --> 00:11:12.625
that they're reliant on one another for the full functioning

202
00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:15.265
of the body according to what God has for it.

203
00:11:18.335 --> 00:11:21.555
So just to be reminded of this, for you

204
00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:25.125
to be reminded believer, you

205
00:11:25.465 --> 00:11:29.365
and I have been gifted by the Lord God Almighty,

206
00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:32.205
if we're believers, you

207
00:11:32.665 --> 00:11:36.605
and I have been graced with the gifts

208
00:11:36.755 --> 00:11:38.365
that God wants for us.

209
00:11:38.795 --> 00:11:41.445
What that means is that you're not worthless,

210
00:11:42.545 --> 00:11:44.005
you're not unnecessary.

211
00:11:46.315 --> 00:11:48.325
Your past might say you are

212
00:11:48.425 --> 00:11:50.805
or others might say you are because of your past.

213
00:11:50.945 --> 00:11:53.565
You are not worthless, you're not unnecessary.

214
00:11:54.365 --> 00:11:58.965
I need your gift. You need my gift.

215
00:11:59.825 --> 00:12:02.925
We need each other in the body of Christ so

216
00:12:02.925 --> 00:12:05.325
that we can grow into God's maturity He has for us.

217
00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:08.675
Ephesians forcep, every

218
00:12:08.675 --> 00:12:10.905
part is critical.

219
00:12:14.425 --> 00:12:17.965
So again, while, while on our own without the faithfulness

220
00:12:17.985 --> 00:12:21.005
of God, we might look back at our past with regret,

221
00:12:21.995 --> 00:12:24.875
with shame, disappointment.

222
00:12:27.245 --> 00:12:29.225
See what the Lord Jesus Christ has done.

223
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:34.175
He's sanctified us. He's enriched us.

224
00:12:35.525 --> 00:12:38.775
He's saved you. He's made you holy. He's gifted you.

225
00:12:39.795 --> 00:12:41.255
We can be sustained

226
00:12:41.285 --> 00:12:44.895
because he who promised has always been faithful

227
00:12:49.475 --> 00:12:51.095
yet is he faithful today?

228
00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.335
I know it's an easy answer, Greg. It's quick.

229
00:12:55.435 --> 00:12:59.475
Yes, but there's some days

230
00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:00.755
it's not that quick, right?

231
00:13:02.695 --> 00:13:05.185
There's some days that it's not as easy to say that

232
00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:09.105
when we look around at our current circumstances

233
00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:12.185
and we get discontent real fast or we get disappointed

234
00:13:12.185 --> 00:13:14.945
because it's not this way or we get distracted by this

235
00:13:15.005 --> 00:13:18.225
or that, it's not maybe as easy to say,

236
00:13:19.855 --> 00:13:21.185
yeah, he's faithful today.

237
00:13:21.445 --> 00:13:24.185
Our problems can so easily overwhelm us.

238
00:13:26.095 --> 00:13:30.595
So how is he faithful today? That's the question past, yes.

239
00:13:30.975 --> 00:13:35.195
How is the Lord Jesus Christ working and faithful today?

240
00:13:35.195 --> 00:13:39.115
What's he doing today? We look at our present.

241
00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:46.335
Well first he's purifying us. We look at this passage.

242
00:13:46.555 --> 00:13:49.415
We know we can piece together some of the elements here

243
00:13:49.415 --> 00:13:53.655
that says, God is purifying us as believers.

244
00:13:55.975 --> 00:14:00.555
And so track this. Remember, he has sanctified us.

245
00:14:00.975 --> 00:14:02.395
So we already are that

246
00:14:04.585 --> 00:14:06.125
and he's called us.

247
00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:08.605
It says to be saints,

248
00:14:09.375 --> 00:14:12.165
which includes both the past action

249
00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:15.285
and the ongoing action as a result.

250
00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:20.675
You can even see it here in verse eight,

251
00:14:20.705 --> 00:14:22.995
that on the day Jesus returns, he's going

252
00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.995
to declare us guiltless.

253
00:14:26.475 --> 00:14:29.535
That's a word that means blameless in a legal

254
00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:32.345
sense like so.

255
00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:35.305
So what this is saying is like you and I are going to appear

256
00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:38.825
before the judge's bench on that day

257
00:14:39.165 --> 00:14:43.425
and our guilty record will have been erased like we will

258
00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:45.065
have been it.

259
00:14:45.065 --> 00:14:46.305
It will have been sent away.

260
00:14:47.585 --> 00:14:48.995
It's like it never even happened

261
00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:50.515
'cause Jesus didn't sin in any way.

262
00:14:50.575 --> 00:14:53.485
So ours is clean because his is standing for us.

263
00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:56.325
It's all covered by Jesus Christ.

264
00:14:58.065 --> 00:15:00.245
In fact, it's what Romans eight says.

265
00:15:00.345 --> 00:15:03.485
Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?

266
00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:08.685
It's God who justifies means there's no more

267
00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:12.025
usability for those who are in Christ.

268
00:15:15.245 --> 00:15:17.785
Now we know that that's coming someday, that's future.

269
00:15:19.045 --> 00:15:21.265
But it's also a reminder

270
00:15:22.405 --> 00:15:26.485
of the believers' position now like today,

271
00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:30.245
that just as we will be on that day,

272
00:15:31.225 --> 00:15:35.595
that's the way we even are today, guiltless.

273
00:15:36.855 --> 00:15:38.755
Now I know you're looking at your life like I just sin this

274
00:15:38.755 --> 00:15:40.035
morning on the way to church, right?

275
00:15:40.095 --> 00:15:44.035
So the point is even that's covered.

276
00:15:45.605 --> 00:15:47.375
When God would stand you

277
00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:50.925
before the bench so to speak, it's covered.

278
00:15:52.075 --> 00:15:54.135
His blood covers past, present, future sins.

279
00:15:54.135 --> 00:15:56.615
It's already covered. So here's the point.

280
00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:01.135
If that's who we are, like if we're

281
00:16:01.725 --> 00:16:05.935
already saints already, holy already guiltless,

282
00:16:07.195 --> 00:16:11.615
here's what Jesus is doing today with that ongoing action.

283
00:16:11.995 --> 00:16:14.975
He is making us more like that reality.

284
00:16:18.015 --> 00:16:19.385
He's purifying us.

285
00:16:19.535 --> 00:16:22.025
He's bringing us closer to the way

286
00:16:22.025 --> 00:16:24.425
that we will actually be on that day.

287
00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:27.345
It's a process we call sanctification.

288
00:16:29.065 --> 00:16:30.525
Now he has sanctified us,

289
00:16:30.785 --> 00:16:32.885
but the process of sanctification is

290
00:16:32.885 --> 00:16:34.085
making us more like that.

291
00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:39.445
Now we're matching our reality. God's making us more holy.

292
00:16:39.555 --> 00:16:40.845
He's making us more pure.

293
00:16:41.155 --> 00:16:44.165
It's what one Thessalonians four 13 says, this is the will

294
00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:46.285
of God for you, your sanctification.

295
00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:50.345
And then he gives a list of actions

296
00:16:51.095 --> 00:16:53.025
that happen in your daily life.

297
00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:56.495
So he's saying sanctification is a process.

298
00:16:58.895 --> 00:17:01.555
So what Paul is saying, check this out, tie this together.

299
00:17:01.905 --> 00:17:06.585
What Paul is saying here is that as believers,

300
00:17:07.755 --> 00:17:09.295
we just need to live out who we already are.

301
00:17:10.115 --> 00:17:13.835
If we already are sanctified, holy guiltless,

302
00:17:14.665 --> 00:17:15.915
just start living it out.

303
00:17:17.605 --> 00:17:19.945
You don't have to try to be it, you already are it.

304
00:17:19.965 --> 00:17:23.155
So just live it out. Sounds

305
00:17:23.195 --> 00:17:24.235
a lot easier than it actually is.

306
00:17:24.355 --> 00:17:27.195
I know, but that's the point he's making.

307
00:17:28.725 --> 00:17:30.535
He's working to purify you,

308
00:17:30.995 --> 00:17:33.055
to make you more like you will be one day.

309
00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:35.755
That also means though,

310
00:17:37.185 --> 00:17:39.435
when we look at our present circumstances instead

311
00:17:39.435 --> 00:17:44.105
of lamenting, instead of looking

312
00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:46.145
around and worrying about my circumstances,

313
00:17:46.175 --> 00:17:47.745
it's not the way I would want it disappointed.

314
00:17:47.745 --> 00:17:51.125
Instead, I could see those circumstances as God's means

315
00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:55.365
to purify me, to sanctify me,

316
00:17:56.425 --> 00:17:57.765
to almost look at these things

317
00:17:57.825 --> 00:18:00.045
and say, thank you, God, for the hard things

318
00:18:01.905 --> 00:18:04.675
because I know you're shaping me through those things,

319
00:18:05.415 --> 00:18:08.755
to purify me, to sanctify me.

320
00:18:08.775 --> 00:18:12.155
And I'm talking about even that hard relationship at work,

321
00:18:15.675 --> 00:18:18.405
even that that injury that just won't seem to heal,

322
00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:22.505
even that sickness that never goes away.

323
00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:25.025
Even even that consistent financial struggle

324
00:18:25.025 --> 00:18:29.575
that you face every month, even

325
00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:33.855
that in all of it.

326
00:18:35.695 --> 00:18:37.995
In all of it, I can know.

327
00:18:39.965 --> 00:18:43.105
See if you can fall along. He's still working on me

328
00:18:44.485 --> 00:18:46.625
to make me what I ought to be.

329
00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:47.945
Right? You remember that I'm, I learned

330
00:18:47.945 --> 00:18:50.185
that song 40 years ago and it still just comes up.

331
00:18:52.085 --> 00:18:53.385
But that's true, isn't it?

332
00:18:54.295 --> 00:18:58.665
He's still working on me to make me what I ought to be

333
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.505
and what I will be one day.

334
00:19:03.875 --> 00:19:07.895
And he uses even hard times to do that.

335
00:19:09.675 --> 00:19:13.415
As Romans five says, we rejoice in our sufferings

336
00:19:14.465 --> 00:19:16.755
knowing that suffering produces endurance.

337
00:19:17.185 --> 00:19:20.755
Endurance produces character. Character produces hope.

338
00:19:21.505 --> 00:19:23.075
Hope does not put us to shame

339
00:19:23.075 --> 00:19:25.715
because God's love has been poured into our hearts

340
00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.155
through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us,

341
00:19:30.695 --> 00:19:33.065
suffering leads to

342
00:19:33.065 --> 00:19:36.035
that if we let it.

343
00:19:37.485 --> 00:19:40.265
So he's purifying us. That's what he's doing right now.

344
00:19:41.295 --> 00:19:43.665
He's purifying us. But he's also notice

345
00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:45.385
what it said in one Corinthians one,

346
00:19:45.815 --> 00:19:47.465
he's also sustaining us.

347
00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:51.415
We saw how he's faithful in the past,

348
00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:55.535
sanctify in rich gift.

349
00:19:56.485 --> 00:19:59.695
He's purifying and he's sustaining us today.

350
00:19:59.755 --> 00:20:01.335
One Corinthians one, look at verses seven

351
00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:05.295
and eight again so that you're not lacking in any gift

352
00:20:05.475 --> 00:20:08.335
as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ,

353
00:20:08.715 --> 00:20:13.655
who will sustain you to the end guiltless in the day

354
00:20:13.655 --> 00:20:14.935
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

355
00:20:15.075 --> 00:20:18.455
So Jesus is coming back someday.

356
00:20:21.405 --> 00:20:23.385
Yet the Corinthians and you

357
00:20:23.385 --> 00:20:26.225
and I are tempted to think, man, how?

358
00:20:26.845 --> 00:20:29.185
How can I even make it

359
00:20:29.185 --> 00:20:32.705
that far my life?

360
00:20:32.735 --> 00:20:35.105
Look at the world. How can I make it?

361
00:20:35.105 --> 00:20:38.225
They they needed to be reminded how they could even make it

362
00:20:38.835 --> 00:20:42.425
verse nine, because God is faithful,

363
00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:47.965
because God is faithful.

364
00:20:50.265 --> 00:20:54.165
In fact, the original language puts the emphasis on faithful

365
00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.885
by putting it first in the sentence it says

366
00:20:56.885 --> 00:20:58.965
essentially, faithful is God.

367
00:21:00.895 --> 00:21:02.965
Faith, like this is what you need to remember.

368
00:21:03.565 --> 00:21:06.405
Faithful is God. He

369
00:21:06.585 --> 00:21:08.765
is faithful.

370
00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:12.045
'cause I know on some days I, I know on some days

371
00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:14.285
how quickly I am tempted to think

372
00:21:14.285 --> 00:21:16.005
that everything's falling apart in my life.

373
00:21:19.425 --> 00:21:22.875
It's all collapsing. How can I even make it through the day?

374
00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.485
And I tend to, this is the phrase

375
00:21:27.485 --> 00:21:29.085
that came the last couple months.

376
00:21:29.245 --> 00:21:30.285
I tend to worry it out

377
00:21:33.215 --> 00:21:34.685
where I'm thinking about the next

378
00:21:34.685 --> 00:21:35.965
steps of whatever could happen.

379
00:21:37.435 --> 00:21:39.245
Well, what if this happens? Well then that's gonna happen.

380
00:21:39.245 --> 00:21:40.885
Well, if that happens, then this is gonna happen

381
00:21:40.905 --> 00:21:42.685
and then this is and so on and so forth.

382
00:21:42.685 --> 00:21:44.685
And you just keep going out. Right?

383
00:21:44.705 --> 00:21:49.005
And I get all worked up about step 45 when step

384
00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:50.085
two might not even happen.

385
00:21:51.555 --> 00:21:53.285
Anybody else do that? Am I the only one?

386
00:21:53.285 --> 00:21:54.445
Maybe I think like

387
00:21:58.195 --> 00:21:59.425
don't worry it out

388
00:22:00.505 --> 00:22:03.235
because what I'm afraid of in that moment, what I'm doing in

389
00:22:03.235 --> 00:22:05.475
that moment, I'm afraid that I won't have enough

390
00:22:05.695 --> 00:22:07.035
to handle step 45.

391
00:22:08.305 --> 00:22:13.275
What am I doing? I'm not trusting God in that moment.

392
00:22:15.025 --> 00:22:16.885
I'm not trusting his sovereign plan

393
00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:18.285
that he knows what he's doing.

394
00:22:18.665 --> 00:22:21.205
I'm not trusting his provision in the moment.

395
00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:26.365
I feel like I have to be in control in order to prevent

396
00:22:26.505 --> 00:22:29.805
or restrict the danger that I see coming on step 45.

397
00:22:34.235 --> 00:22:36.945
Jesus had some words to say about that

398
00:22:38.225 --> 00:22:39.605
in Matthew chapter six.

399
00:22:41.025 --> 00:22:42.485
He says, therefore I tell you,

400
00:22:42.745 --> 00:22:45.285
do not be anxious about your life, what you'll eat

401
00:22:45.285 --> 00:22:47.405
or what you'll drink, nor about your body.

402
00:22:47.515 --> 00:22:50.525
What you will put on is not life more than food

403
00:22:51.465 --> 00:22:52.845
and the body more than clothing.

404
00:22:52.875 --> 00:22:54.165
Look at the birds of the air.

405
00:22:54.595 --> 00:22:57.165
They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns.

406
00:22:57.165 --> 00:22:58.685
Yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

407
00:22:59.345 --> 00:23:01.005
Are you not of more value than they?

408
00:23:02.505 --> 00:23:05.165
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour

409
00:23:05.165 --> 00:23:06.205
to his span of life?

410
00:23:08.695 --> 00:23:10.115
Why are you anxious about clothing?

411
00:23:10.595 --> 00:23:12.475
Consider the lilies of the field. They they grow.

412
00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:13.755
They neither toil nor spin.

413
00:23:13.775 --> 00:23:16.155
Yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was

414
00:23:16.155 --> 00:23:17.195
not arrayed like one of these.

415
00:23:18.715 --> 00:23:20.815
But if God so closed the grass of the field,

416
00:23:20.815 --> 00:23:22.935
which today's alive tomorrow is thrown into the oven,

417
00:23:23.245 --> 00:23:24.775
will he not much more clothe you

418
00:23:25.395 --> 00:23:26.615
of you, owe you of little faith.

419
00:23:28.245 --> 00:23:30.975
Therefore, do not be anxious

420
00:23:32.465 --> 00:23:33.565
saying, what shall we eat?

421
00:23:33.565 --> 00:23:36.645
What shall we drink? What shall we wear the Gentiles seek?

422
00:23:36.645 --> 00:23:38.525
After all these things, your heavenly Father knows

423
00:23:38.525 --> 00:23:42.925
that you need them all, but seek first the kingdom of God

424
00:23:43.185 --> 00:23:44.325
and his righteousness

425
00:23:44.585 --> 00:23:46.645
and all, all these things will be added to you.

426
00:23:48.735 --> 00:23:51.465
Therefore do not. This is it right here.

427
00:23:51.565 --> 00:23:53.105
Do not be anxious about tomorrow,

428
00:23:53.845 --> 00:23:55.585
for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

429
00:23:57.645 --> 00:24:00.325
Sufficient for the day is its own trouble,

430
00:24:02.575 --> 00:24:05.515
not step 45, you're on step one.

431
00:24:06.055 --> 00:24:08.475
That's what you need to be concerned about right now.

432
00:24:08.475 --> 00:24:09.995
That's what you need to focus on, right?

433
00:24:11.425 --> 00:24:12.845
And notice what Jesus said there.

434
00:24:12.985 --> 00:24:16.845
He promised that each day will have trouble.

435
00:24:22.225 --> 00:24:24.525
Yet don't forget the other promise we saw today in one

436
00:24:24.525 --> 00:24:25.805
Corinthians one, eight, which says

437
00:24:25.805 --> 00:24:29.325
that the Lord Jesus Christ will sustain you to the end.

438
00:24:31.055 --> 00:24:32.275
That's a promise too, right?

439
00:24:32.335 --> 00:24:34.195
So he promised troubles coming every day,

440
00:24:34.495 --> 00:24:38.325
but the promise is also he'll sustain you.

441
00:24:40.735 --> 00:24:43.795
Now, that does not mean that he won't protect you from

442
00:24:44.545 --> 00:24:49.465
criticism at work or from cancer and you

443
00:24:49.465 --> 00:24:53.335
or your family, but

444
00:24:53.335 --> 00:24:54.615
here's what you can trust.

445
00:24:56.945 --> 00:24:58.605
You don't know. Maybe that stuff's coming for you

446
00:24:58.625 --> 00:25:00.165
and for me, and maybe that's going to happen.

447
00:25:00.225 --> 00:25:03.725
But here's what you can trust that in the middle of all of

448
00:25:03.725 --> 00:25:06.325
that, because he sustains you,

449
00:25:06.615 --> 00:25:08.725
there is still some unique goodness

450
00:25:08.745 --> 00:25:10.045
to be experienced in the middle

451
00:25:10.045 --> 00:25:14.295
of it as you go through it.

452
00:25:17.275 --> 00:25:18.775
And this changes everything, doesn't it

453
00:25:21.335 --> 00:25:25.625
Like we can be satisfied in him, even as we wait

454
00:25:25.765 --> 00:25:27.985
for the revealing, even as we wait through the troubles

455
00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:30.585
and we deal with trials because the Lord Jesus Christ is

456
00:25:30.585 --> 00:25:33.065
purifying us in it and he's sustaining us in it.

457
00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:35.905
That's how we can be satisfied.

458
00:25:37.415 --> 00:25:40.435
All the disappointments, all the discontent

459
00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:43.595
that we might face in our daily lives.

460
00:25:44.225 --> 00:25:47.075
He's exchanging that for satisfaction in him.

461
00:25:49.945 --> 00:25:53.315
He's proving to us He is enough for us.

462
00:25:57.665 --> 00:25:59.005
But that's the thing about hope.

463
00:26:01.745 --> 00:26:03.855
We've all been there at some point where we know

464
00:26:05.285 --> 00:26:08.095
that when we're confident something is coming in the future,

465
00:26:08.715 --> 00:26:11.255
it sure seems to change the way we act and think here

466
00:26:11.255 --> 00:26:14.895
and now when you know that trip is coming

467
00:26:14.895 --> 00:26:17.375
or when you know that gift is going to be given, you can,

468
00:26:17.795 --> 00:26:21.495
you can change the way you think and act even today.

469
00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:26.945
And so it's good for us to be reminded

470
00:26:26.945 --> 00:26:29.545
of God's faithfulness in the past, his faithfulness

471
00:26:29.645 --> 00:26:30.665
to us in the present.

472
00:26:33.645 --> 00:26:34.945
But what will he do in the future?

473
00:26:37.285 --> 00:26:39.985
How is he faithful tomorrow and the next day

474
00:26:39.985 --> 00:26:43.765
and the forever, just as much as he has been and is today?

475
00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:46.445
What will he do in the future?

476
00:26:49.205 --> 00:26:50.495
Well, I've already said it a little bit,

477
00:26:50.495 --> 00:26:52.575
but it's what Paul wrote here in verse seven.

478
00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:54.735
We're all waiting for the revealing

479
00:26:55.475 --> 00:26:57.295
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

480
00:26:59.145 --> 00:27:02.935
We're on that day. As the scriptures refer to many times,

481
00:27:03.445 --> 00:27:05.495
that verse eight says here on that day,

482
00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:10.495
the eastern sky will split open and we will finally see him.

483
00:27:10.915 --> 00:27:13.255
He will meet us face to face.

484
00:27:15.685 --> 00:27:17.535
This is what Jesus is going to do.

485
00:27:17.555 --> 00:27:20.495
We don't know when, but we know it's going to happen.

486
00:27:23.535 --> 00:27:28.075
In fact, it's what Hebrews 9 27 28 says

487
00:27:30.055 --> 00:27:33.065
that just as it is appointed for man to die once and

488
00:27:33.065 --> 00:27:35.745
after that comes judgment, the bench of the judge.

489
00:27:37.365 --> 00:27:40.865
So Christ having been offered once to bear the sins

490
00:27:40.865 --> 00:27:45.505
of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin,

491
00:27:45.765 --> 00:27:49.985
but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.

492
00:27:54.705 --> 00:27:57.785
I don't want us to skim over that last phrase too quickly,

493
00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:01.495
eagerly waiting for him.

494
00:28:01.635 --> 00:28:04.535
Is that, is that the orientation of our hearts,

495
00:28:08.265 --> 00:28:11.275
this anxious expectation of seeing him?

496
00:28:12.665 --> 00:28:13.835
Like we wake up in the morning

497
00:28:13.855 --> 00:28:17.395
and we think maybe today's the day I get to see Jesus

498
00:28:19.205 --> 00:28:21.865
is, is that how we posture our hearts?

499
00:28:25.315 --> 00:28:27.355
I confess to you that that's

500
00:28:27.355 --> 00:28:29.035
so often not on my heart and mind.

501
00:28:33.275 --> 00:28:35.095
Now, maybe when life is especially hard,

502
00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:36.415
I tend to think that way.

503
00:28:37.035 --> 00:28:39.255
But the majority of times it's kind

504
00:28:39.255 --> 00:28:41.015
of in the background if there at all.

505
00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:45.585
So why? Why is it not right here?

506
00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:47.185
Why is it not on the forefront of our minds?

507
00:28:47.185 --> 00:28:49.705
If we're not eagerly expecting, eagerly wait,

508
00:28:49.845 --> 00:28:50.865
why is it not there?

509
00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:52.945
Well, maybe because we, we might believe

510
00:28:52.945 --> 00:28:54.705
that he won't actually come back.

511
00:28:56.795 --> 00:28:58.935
We don't believe it because we've been burned

512
00:28:59.315 --> 00:29:00.735
so many times in this life

513
00:29:00.835 --> 00:29:03.695
by unfulfilled promises from people we love and trusted.

514
00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:06.375
And they kept saying this and they didn't come through.

515
00:29:06.595 --> 00:29:08.015
And now we're thinking, well, maybe not.

516
00:29:08.995 --> 00:29:11.945
Maybe Jesus isn't actually telling us the truth,

517
00:29:13.755 --> 00:29:15.015
or it seems so delayed.

518
00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:16.655
It's just been so long, man.

519
00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:17.735
Maybe it's not actually gonna happen.

520
00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:24.955
But remember verse nine was just say,

521
00:29:25.135 --> 00:29:26.675
God is faithful.

522
00:29:29.175 --> 00:29:31.475
You've seen it in the past. You've seen it in your life.

523
00:29:31.775 --> 00:29:34.435
God is faithful. Faithful is God, right?

524
00:29:34.755 --> 00:29:37.875
Remember, this is the point. He always has been, always is.

525
00:29:38.135 --> 00:29:42.325
And so we can know, he always will be faithful

526
00:29:46.205 --> 00:29:49.625
Or maybe, maybe his return is not on the forefront

527
00:29:49.625 --> 00:29:51.865
of our minds because we kind of like it here.

528
00:29:54.935 --> 00:29:56.835
We kind of enjoy it here.

529
00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:02.115
In fact, I've had a number of young people along the

530
00:30:02.315 --> 00:30:04.755
ministry years I've served, come to me over the years

531
00:30:04.815 --> 00:30:08.395
and say that they, they sure wanted Jesus to come back,

532
00:30:08.415 --> 00:30:10.235
but they wanted him to wait till after the wedding.

533
00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:16.555
And I am not dogging on that group specifically.

534
00:30:16.795 --> 00:30:17.835
'cause I probably said that too.

535
00:30:19.195 --> 00:30:20.835
'cause we all do it in some ways, don't we?

536
00:30:21.815 --> 00:30:22.845
We all do it in ways.

537
00:30:22.855 --> 00:30:25.165
We're like, boy, I really want you to come back Jesus,

538
00:30:25.265 --> 00:30:26.845
but I sure wanna see my grandkids.

539
00:30:27.005 --> 00:30:29.485
I sure want to graduate. Like whatever it is, we come up

540
00:30:29.485 --> 00:30:30.885
with all these things.

541
00:30:31.315 --> 00:30:35.005
What it shows That we're too comfortable here,

542
00:30:38.455 --> 00:30:42.385
that this is home to us rather than our true home.

543
00:30:42.975 --> 00:30:46.275
That There's a little bit of idolatry in our hearts.

544
00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:52.505
That we love things here more than we love the

545
00:30:52.505 --> 00:30:53.585
Lord who's coming back.

546
00:30:56.315 --> 00:30:57.915
I read this from Piper this week.

547
00:30:58.015 --> 00:30:59.795
He said, there is a phony faith

548
00:30:59.945 --> 00:31:02.235
that once only escaped from hell,

549
00:31:02.495 --> 00:31:04.115
but has no desire for Christ.

550
00:31:05.705 --> 00:31:06.875
That does not save.

551
00:31:07.985 --> 00:31:10.845
And it does not produce an eager expectation

552
00:31:10.905 --> 00:31:12.205
for Christ to come.

553
00:31:13.725 --> 00:31:17.185
It would rather that Christ not come for as long as possible

554
00:31:17.245 --> 00:31:20.025
so that it can have as much of this world as possible.

555
00:31:22.555 --> 00:31:26.135
But the faith that really holds on to Christ as the treasure

556
00:31:26.235 --> 00:31:29.695
and hope and joy is the faith that makes us along

557
00:31:29.795 --> 00:31:31.055
for Christ to come.

558
00:31:31.555 --> 00:31:33.135
And that is the faith that saves,

559
00:31:35.395 --> 00:31:38.965
take Christ not just as your fire insurance policy,

560
00:31:39.345 --> 00:31:42.325
but as your eagerly awaited bridegroom and friend and Lord.

561
00:31:47.475 --> 00:31:50.175
So some of us are waiting or are not waiting eagerly

562
00:31:50.175 --> 00:31:52.055
because we may not believe or

563
00:31:52.055 --> 00:31:56.485
because we love this world too much still.

564
00:31:56.485 --> 00:31:59.485
Others are just hoping for the end to come

565
00:31:59.505 --> 00:32:02.845
to finally get rid of all this mess, the junk in the world

566
00:32:02.905 --> 00:32:06.565
and and all the sin and carnage and pain and ungodliness.

567
00:32:06.595 --> 00:32:09.085
They're just like, end it Lord. Come on.

568
00:32:11.415 --> 00:32:13.195
But is that the right perspective? Either?

569
00:32:17.045 --> 00:32:18.385
Here's another way it's been said.

570
00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:20.225
The early believers were not looking

571
00:32:20.285 --> 00:32:21.505
for something to happen.

572
00:32:22.175 --> 00:32:23.785
They were looking for someone to come.

573
00:32:25.945 --> 00:32:28.755
Looking for the train to arrive is one thing,

574
00:32:29.695 --> 00:32:32.835
but looking for someone we love to come on

575
00:32:32.835 --> 00:32:34.475
that train is a whole nother matter.

576
00:32:36.865 --> 00:32:39.165
Is he coming to do the sin and ungodly

577
00:32:39.185 --> 00:32:40.325
and strike it all away?

578
00:32:40.765 --> 00:32:42.325
Absolutely. But is that what we want?

579
00:32:42.385 --> 00:32:44.005
Or do we want the the one who's coming?

580
00:32:47.555 --> 00:32:49.175
See, that's what strengthens our hearts.

581
00:32:49.275 --> 00:32:53.575
That's what sustains our lives, is not just

582
00:32:53.575 --> 00:32:55.415
that everything's gonna be made right, it's the fact

583
00:32:55.415 --> 00:32:59.295
that we have a faithful God who we love,

584
00:32:59.585 --> 00:33:03.535
who's returning for us to take us home with him forever.

585
00:33:05.445 --> 00:33:09.465
That's why Psalm 27, 4 says, wait for the Lord,

586
00:33:10.165 --> 00:33:12.065
be strong and take courage.

587
00:33:13.845 --> 00:33:18.325
Wait for the Lord. In other words, wait

588
00:33:18.325 --> 00:33:19.405
for the one you love.

589
00:33:20.785 --> 00:33:24.695
He's coming back. So stand strong today

590
00:33:25.965 --> 00:33:28.295
because not only is he gonna meet us in that moment,

591
00:33:28.595 --> 00:33:29.615
here's another part of it.

592
00:33:29.685 --> 00:33:34.095
He's going to purify us and perfect us in that moment.

593
00:33:35.745 --> 00:33:37.295
We've been building to this right past,

594
00:33:37.355 --> 00:33:38.935
taking care of present.

595
00:33:38.965 --> 00:33:41.815
He's working on us. Some days coming, he's going

596
00:33:41.875 --> 00:33:43.295
to perfect us.

597
00:33:43.325 --> 00:33:45.975
What He's made us already, these sanctified saints,

598
00:33:45.975 --> 00:33:49.135
blameless the image of Christ, he's shaping us into daily.

599
00:33:49.995 --> 00:33:52.615
One day he's gonna finally finish that,

600
00:33:52.875 --> 00:33:54.015
and it's that day when it's coming.

601
00:33:55.975 --> 00:33:59.745
Philippians 1, 6, 1 of my favorite verses, I'm sure of this,

602
00:33:59.775 --> 00:34:04.665
that he who began a good work in you will surely bring

603
00:34:04.665 --> 00:34:06.945
it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.

604
00:34:08.915 --> 00:34:12.425
So if he started a work in your life, if he's starting

605
00:34:12.485 --> 00:34:15.665
to do something like he's saved you, he is saving you,

606
00:34:15.665 --> 00:34:16.705
and one day he will save you.

607
00:34:17.085 --> 00:34:19.585
If he started it, he's going to finish it.

608
00:34:21.315 --> 00:34:22.845
Take heart in that.

609
00:34:25.385 --> 00:34:27.565
And because all of this is coming,

610
00:34:27.875 --> 00:34:30.005
because we know Jesus will meet us,

611
00:34:30.005 --> 00:34:33.645
because we know he will perfect us instead of the fear

612
00:34:33.645 --> 00:34:34.645
that comes with the future.

613
00:34:34.955 --> 00:34:37.205
What we instead can see is hope,

614
00:34:39.715 --> 00:34:41.295
is fear of the unknown.

615
00:34:41.325 --> 00:34:43.055
Like that. Fear creeps in

616
00:34:43.055 --> 00:34:44.695
because we don't even know what's gonna happen this

617
00:34:44.695 --> 00:34:46.055
afternoon, let alone tomorrow.

618
00:34:48.115 --> 00:34:49.535
It takes one phone call

619
00:34:49.555 --> 00:34:51.335
to change your whole life, doesn't it?

620
00:34:53.325 --> 00:34:56.145
One doctor's appointment, one instance on the highway.

621
00:34:56.205 --> 00:35:00.865
It takes one moment and what you had thought and dreamed

622
00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:03.105
and planned is totally changed.

623
00:35:04.425 --> 00:35:05.845
We have no idea what's gonna happen.

624
00:35:05.865 --> 00:35:08.685
So that's where fear starts to creep in Step 45,

625
00:35:09.475 --> 00:35:10.645
fear over that.

626
00:35:12.355 --> 00:35:15.325
Instead of fear though, because this is true,

627
00:35:15.325 --> 00:35:19.605
because God is utterly dependable, we can exchange

628
00:35:19.605 --> 00:35:20.725
that fear with hope.

629
00:35:23.215 --> 00:35:24.315
The fear that we have

630
00:35:24.545 --> 00:35:28.475
because of the future in our normal worldly, earthly,

631
00:35:28.585 --> 00:35:31.995
fleshly lives that can be exchanged with hope,

632
00:35:32.095 --> 00:35:35.155
the blessed hope that Titus two 13 identifies

633
00:35:35.155 --> 00:35:38.445
as the appearing of the glory of our great God

634
00:35:38.445 --> 00:35:39.565
and Savior Jesus Christ.

635
00:35:40.425 --> 00:35:41.805
That's where hope comes from.

636
00:35:46.455 --> 00:35:48.475
So do you remember how we started this sermon today?

637
00:35:49.755 --> 00:35:52.335
The thought experiment where you look at your past, present,

638
00:35:52.335 --> 00:35:53.855
future, but in doing

639
00:35:53.915 --> 00:35:56.215
so you've removed the faithfulness of God.

640
00:35:56.365 --> 00:35:57.775
What did we get from that?

641
00:35:59.785 --> 00:36:03.405
When we look at our past, we get regret, shame.

642
00:36:05.215 --> 00:36:06.865
Look at our present. What? What do we get?

643
00:36:06.865 --> 00:36:07.745
We get discontent,

644
00:36:08.605 --> 00:36:12.325
disappointment, and we look at our future.

645
00:36:12.345 --> 00:36:14.885
We get a lot of fear over the unknown,

646
00:36:16.605 --> 00:36:18.765
but now we've come back around

647
00:36:18.865 --> 00:36:21.605
and we've been reminded of the faithfulness

648
00:36:21.705 --> 00:36:23.245
of God, past, present, future.

649
00:36:23.385 --> 00:36:25.645
We see how he has done it.

650
00:36:25.675 --> 00:36:27.165
What ought to be different now

651
00:36:31.465 --> 00:36:32.995
because God is faithful,

652
00:36:33.895 --> 00:36:37.815
he exchanged the regret with forgiveness.

653
00:36:39.205 --> 00:36:43.505
He's exchanged the discontent with satisfaction,

654
00:36:45.265 --> 00:36:48.675
and he's exchanged the fear with hope.

655
00:36:51.465 --> 00:36:53.485
That's how he sustains us. Church.

656
00:36:55.425 --> 00:36:59.765
In the midst of all the problems that I have, here's

657
00:36:59.765 --> 00:37:01.085
to the problems I don't have anymore.

658
00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:04.245
I don't have a fear of separation from God forever.

659
00:37:05.935 --> 00:37:09.335
I don't have the fear of his absence today,

660
00:37:11.695 --> 00:37:15.595
and I don't have the fear of an insecure future anymore.

661
00:37:19.965 --> 00:37:22.005
I know that in the midst of all of it,

662
00:37:22.005 --> 00:37:25.645
because God is faithful in all of what I'm experiencing.

663
00:37:25.645 --> 00:37:27.805
He has some unique goodness for me in it.

664
00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.355
We just need to look to him for it.
