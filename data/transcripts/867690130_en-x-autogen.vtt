1
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.800
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.560
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

3
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.840
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth

4
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.360
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in

5
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.293
God.

6
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.240
When Christ who is your life appears, then you will also appear with him. And

7
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.480
Well, good morning again, church. Uh,

8
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.080
what a gift it is to be together today as it is every Sunday. Uh,

9
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.440
you might notice some things that are a little bit different up here.

10
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.480
You might hear some things a little different. Uh,

11
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.800
this are now sadly HD screens. Great.

12
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.720
You can see everything. So, uh, anyway, uh, so that's that.

13
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.840
There's one screen missing yet here that will go between.

14
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.960
It'll have mostly lyrics on it. So just so you know,

15
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.600
we're not finished yet with even the lobby. So things are still working,

16
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.680
but we're thankful that, uh, it does sound incredible.

17
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.920
And we're excited to see how God's gonna continue to use that.

18
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.360
We're thankful for his provision through you and through the land and everything

19
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.440
that, uh, God did. If you're new to our church, I hope you feel welcomed.

20
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.400
We'd love to meet you. Hopefully we get a chance to, uh,

21
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.200
get to meet you and then you get to meet us.

22
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.200
So please come say hello to one of us up here or out there at the lobby.

23
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.200
Just say hi and get to know us. Wanna feel connected here. Uh,

24
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.680
that's what we hope for you feel as we get into it today.

25
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.920
How many of you ever forgotten something? Anybody ever forgotten anything?

26
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.720
Homework at school, maybe or, uh,

27
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.000
your credit card at a pizza place in Chickasha, uh,

28
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.560
not speaking from experience there or a Bitcoin password

29
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.080
to get $220 million? Anybody? No.

30
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.240
That was Stephan Thomas did that a few years ago,

31
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.280
so he must feel pretty badly. But forgetting things does make us feel terrible,

32
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.163
right?

33
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.440
Yet nothing we've ever forgotten in our daily lives

34
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.040
can compare to what we're gonna talk about today.

35
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.280
Potentially forgetting that has not only daily realities and

36
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.990
consequences, but eternal as well.

37
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.180
And so to see that,

38
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.540
take your copy of God's word and turn with me to Colossians chapter two.

39
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.580
It's in the New Testament, Colossians chapter two.

40
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.060
We're continuing through Colossians and we'll be in chapter two verses six

41
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.480
through 15 today as we take the fall to walk through Colossians

42
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.480
Colossians two, six through 15. Now, now verse six.

43
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.640
Marks a shift in the book itself in the letter that Paul's writing to

44
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.520
the church at Colossae. And,

45
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.360
and we know it's a shift because the massive first word in verse

46
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.700
six,

47
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.320
and this is something you should be looking for when you're reading the Bible by

48
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.680
yourself. What is this shift?

49
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.400
What's the word there that he used at the beginning of verse six? What is it?

50
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.480
Therefore, therefore, right. And so we need to ask what's the therefore,

51
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.320
therefore we need to understand why it's there.

52
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.080
It's a shift in his whole letter.

53
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.720
Because what that word means is anything that comes after that is based on what

54
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.080
he just said before that. So in other words,

55
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.440
what he's done with this whole introduction where he's talked about who God is,

56
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.280
he's talked about how we can, we can understand his salvation of us.

57
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.480
He's talked about the supremacy of Christ and all of this that we know and,

58
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.520
and come to understand about the gospel. He says, because of all of that,

59
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.560
do this. That's what we're about to see, is what he says then in response, like,

60
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.480
what is the therefore now leading us to in the body of the letter

61
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.920
Here it is starting with verse six, down through 15 today.

62
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.960
Therefore, as you received Christ, the Lord,

63
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.120
so walk in him rooted and built up in him and established in

64
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.600
the faith just as you were taught abounding in Thanksgiving.

65
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.920
See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy.

66
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.840
An empty deceit according to human tradition,

67
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.120
according to the elemental spirits or principles of the world and not according

68
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.953
to Christ.

69
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.740
For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.

70
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.460
And you have been filled in him who is the head of all rule and authority

71
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.753
in him. Also,

72
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.420
you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands by putting off the

73
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.980
body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,

74
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.780
having been buried with him in baptism,

75
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.780
in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of

76
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.020
God who raised him from the dead.

77
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.030
And you who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh,

78
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.110
God made alive together with him having forgiven us all our trespasses

79
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.910
by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands.

80
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.470
This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.

81
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.270
He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame by

82
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.810
triumphing over them in him. God,

83
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.170
we need you to show us today what you want to show us.

84
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.800
We need your spirit to open our, our minds eyes,

85
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.120
our hearts eyes to see and feel and understand what you want us to see here.

86
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.960
How you want to change our lives, how you want us to see you differently.

87
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.520
Make us in our hearts good soil that this seed of the gospel plants

88
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.560
in and produces good fruit in our lives. God, this is your work.

89
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.960
It's not me. Get me outta the way.

90
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.600
Get get your word and and yourself at the center of everything today.

91
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.240
Teach us, show us, change us for your glory.

92
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.000
In Jesus' name. Amen.

93
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.320
So the thread that we're beginning to pull here will follow us through the next

94
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.360
few weeks of Colossians. In fact, pretty much the whole rest of Colossians,

95
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.080
'cause it goes back to the, the point of the entire letter.

96
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.320
Why was Paul writing this to them? Because remember,

97
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.360
this young church in Colossae was surrounded by a smorgasbord of other

98
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.840
religions. There were false religious practices and uh,

99
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.080
religious rituals and philosophies and practices and pagan things

100
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.080
all around, all happening right in their vicinity,

101
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.800
including a form of Judaism that was right at their doorstep.

102
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.720
And so people all around this church were saying that there were all kinds of

103
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.360
spiritual and material powers that even Christians were supposed to pacify.

104
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.490
Like you. You guys need to worry, okay, you can do your thing,

105
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.530
but you need to worry about these material and physical and spiritual powers out

106
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.730
there and you better do something to make them happy too.

107
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.690
That's what they were hearing.

108
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.860
And so the temptation for these new Christians was to get sucked into all of

109
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.660
these other beliefs and all these other practices and to lose the essence

110
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.740
of the gospel that had freed them.

111
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.010
That's why Paul made it a point to say to this young church that they needed to

112
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.370
remember the gospel.

113
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.750
Remember this gospel that they had received? Like just remember it.

114
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.590
'cause he's saying, you guys might have forgotten this.

115
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.070
He said this again already in chapter one, but, but here again very clearly,

116
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.670
he says, remember the gospel you received?

117
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.940
And look at verse eight. He says it this way,

118
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.460
see to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy.

119
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.700
An empty deceit according to human tradition,

120
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.140
according to the elemental principles of the world and not according to Christ.

121
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.700
Pretty clear, right?

122
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.330
Don't get sucked into all these worldly ideas,

123
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.970
including he mentions human traditions.

124
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.890
We'll talk a lot more about this next week. But,

125
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.490
but here he is referencing Jewish traditions.

126
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.250
How do we know he's talking about Jewish traditions? Well,

127
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.970
because he mentions circumcision in the next verse. And,

128
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.450
and circumcision for the Jews was a physical designation that they were God's

129
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.160
people.

130
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.850
Like it marked them off from the rest of society that this was something that

131
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.890
showed they were gods. And so Paul making a big deal about it here,

132
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.270
it's an indication that at least some people in the church were being tempted to

133
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:55.550
try to go back to Judaism. That, that maybe they had heard,

134
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.270
okay, Christ, that's fine, Jesus. Okay?

135
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.470
But you also have to do these Jewish things in order to make sure you're saved.

136
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.730
Well, that's why Paul here says what he says.

137
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.010
He reminds them of the gospel that they had received earlier,

138
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.850
that gospel that Romans one says is the power of God for the salvation of those

139
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:21.410
who believe nothing else. It's the gospel.

140
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.330
It's Jesus work in your place. He's saying, guys, you had received Christ,

141
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.930
Jesus the Lord, you were rooted, built up,

142
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.890
established in the faith that you were taught. So don't drift.

143
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.710
Well, what was this faith that they had been taught?

144
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.230
What was this gospel message that he's referencing here? Well,

145
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.070
it's one Corinthians 15, three and four. He says,

146
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.990
I delivered to you as of first importance. What I also received,

147
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.670
that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures. He was buried.

148
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.470
And then he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures.

149
00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.830
That's the gospel. In essence,

150
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.950
add one Timothy three 16, great indeed, we confess is the mystery of godliness.

151
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.230
That he Christ was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the spirit,

152
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.310
seen by angels proclaimed among the nations,

153
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.230
believed on in the world and taken up in glory.

154
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.750
Like those were hymns of faith.

155
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.910
The gospel truth that they passed around at that time that just marked

156
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.870
in their minds, this is what the gospel actually is.

157
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.110
This is the truth that they could stand on.

158
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.470
This is the truth that they would be saved by.

159
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.870
This was the only thing they needed. Nothing else.

160
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.560
They didn't need to add anything to that gospel.

161
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.460
But just think about the culture and colossae,

162
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.760
I'm sure that those philosophies and the worldly principles

163
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.840
that they were hearing, I'm sure they were all really nicely packaged, right?

164
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.950
I mean, just think about the people who were spreading all of that information.

165
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.950
They were probably really good at what they were saying.

166
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.270
They were very easy to listen to.

167
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.950
These people would make it sound very appealing for these worldly philosophies

168
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.350
and principles Paul talks about to be believed.

169
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.710
And so it might have been fairly simple to slip into those things.

170
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.470
It might have been hard to resist.

171
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.010
These Christians again, might have heard from other people that, okay,

172
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.010
it's fine for you to worship Jesus,

173
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.930
but you also need to add all of these other things on top of it.

174
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.900
And it might've sounded good.

175
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.140
It might've appealed to their flesh that we kind of wanna work for our

176
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.860
salvation, don't we? And so they were like, well, maybe that's true.

177
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.160
That's why Paul went into this extended section on who

178
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.880
God is and what he's done. Like when you're identifying counterfeit money,

179
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.650
it's okay to be aware of what counterfeits can look like. But what do you do?

180
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:08.330
You study the real thing and know it so well that you can identify

181
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.810
any other false money, any other counterfeit money that might come your way.

182
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.490
'cause you know the real things so well, that's what Paul's talking about here.

183
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.970
His answer to the threats that the Colossians were facing

184
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.690
was to remind them of the God of their salvation.

185
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.920
He didn't try to answer everything. He does answer some,

186
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.720
but doesn't try to answer everything. He just says, no, no, remember, here's,

187
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.080
here's who God is. Remember who God is and what he's done for you.

188
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.910
And he says, Hey, if you really say you worship him,

189
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.070
then you should revere him.

190
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.200
Like you should revere this God, you say you worship right now.

191
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.000
Now that word revere, we don't use it a whole lot. Maybe Paul revere,

192
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.880
but that's not a different, that's a different thing, right? So,

193
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.600
so revering someone,

194
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.380
it means we respect, we love, we honor,

195
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.380
we give authority to, that's, that's how we revere someone,

196
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.780
even to the point where we, we maybe fear them a little bit

197
00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.830
here. Here's how I heard it described years ago.

198
00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.510
It's like when you're a little kid. So kids,

199
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.590
you might have had this actually happen recently to you,

200
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.590
like you're a little kid and you're standing there and this massive dog just

201
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.750
walks right up to you and it's taller than you are, but it it face-to-face,

202
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.070
it just stands right here, right?

203
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.750
So it's kind of cool and also a little terrifying that that dog

204
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.190
is this big right in front of you, right? That's in a sense,

205
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.180
kind of the idea we get here. That it's,

206
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:47.980
it's really cool to think about God and to to honor him. It's also should,

207
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.220
it also should be a little terrifying to us.

208
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.620
When we truly think about who God is,

209
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.740
we should revere God because of who he is.

210
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.820
And that's why Paul describes who he is.

211
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.470
Starting in verse nine, look at what he says about this God,

212
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.670
for in him the whole fullness of deity dwells

213
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.390
bodily. Who's he talking about? In whom is he referencing?

214
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.510
He's talking about Jesus. Now,

215
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:23.930
just let that marinate for a moment. Just,

216
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.250
just think about this for a second.

217
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.850
The whole fullness of deity,

218
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.810
all that God is

219
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.700
dwells in the body of Jesus

220
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.200
mind blowing hard to understand.

221
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.070
And I know saying that brings up some theological questions.

222
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.110
I I talked about this a couple weeks ago as well in chapter one,

223
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.560
as we start talking about, there's are deep,

224
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.920
profound things as we start to open this box of,

225
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.800
of the incarnation of Christ, and we talk about the Trinity, like there's,

226
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.880
there's hard things to grasp.

227
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.940
But notice what verse nine says.

228
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.900
It says not only that Jesus is fully God, even as he took on a fully human body,

229
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.500
that's the incarnation,

230
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.060
but there's also a more to God than just Jesus.

231
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.000
See,

232
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.880
I think we can get too Christ centric at times where we neglect the

233
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.360
fullness of God.

234
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.570
And I say that as we're in a series called Christ Above all I understand

235
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.450
I'm saying that in that context,

236
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.200
what we're saying with Christ above all is that in relation to

237
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.760
all the other philosophies and religious practices and worldview

238
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.720
around the people in Colossi Christ was and

239
00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.920
still is above them all.

240
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.960
What we're not saying Is that God, the Son,

241
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.600
is somehow less than God the Father or God the Spirit,

242
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.040
or somehow more than God the Father or God the Spirit.

243
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:13.200
We're not saying anything about that. No, God is Trinity one God, three persons.

244
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.730
Here's how I read it this week. There is, but one,

245
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.730
living in true God everlasting without body parts or

246
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.170
passions of infinite power, wisdom and goodness.

247
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.010
The maker and preserver of all things both visible and invisible.

248
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.490
And in unity of this godhead, there'd be three persons of one, substance,

249
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.690
power, and eternity. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

250
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.430
Now I know hard to understand, right? Yes,

251
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.790
it's really hard to understand,

252
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.270
but it's incredibly important for us to grasp this as best we can. God is God,

253
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.070
we're not. So we're not gonna fully understand it. But,

254
00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:01.110
but this is one piece that distinguishes our beliefs from all other

255
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.650
religious practices and beliefs. I heard this,

256
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.890
I I'm gonna get the the number wrong so you can go check this. But,

257
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.410
but recently they did a survey of

258
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.370
church-going, people, like attending people,

259
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.450
not just ones who come on Christmas and Easter,

260
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.250
but but like you who are here almost weekly, right?

261
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.690
They did a survey and asked the questions theologically that, that we should,

262
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.610
should ask. Like, what is this? What is this? What is it? One of the questions

263
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:38.370
was the question, do Christians and Muslims worship the same God?

264
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.930
40 some percent said yes.

265
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.903
Hear that

266
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.980
40 some percent of people who go to church all the time

267
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.140
say, yeah, Allah, God almighty, they're the same.

268
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.700
Now I'm gonna answer that question for you,

269
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.700
that if you get a call from Barna or somebody,

270
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.460
you know how to answer the question. They're not the same.

271
00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.820
They're not. This is the God we worship.

272
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.140
And one of the main things distinguishing that is the fact that it's one God,

273
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.780
three persons Trinity, right? That this is what is different. It's not the same.

274
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.060
We're not just looking perspectives. This and this. No, it's not the same.

275
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:39.500
This is God who is unique over all. And in him,

276
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.820
in Jesus, the body all thi all the fullness of God dwells

277
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.470
mind blowing but also encouraging, right?

278
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.860
But, but think about that all the fullness of God,

279
00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.540
it dwells within Jesus bodily. Why would Paul say that?

280
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.620
Why would he write that here? Well,

281
00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.900
he wrote that to remind the Colossians as verse 10 says, that,

282
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:10.420
that truth makes Christ the head of all rule and authority.

283
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.340
If he is God, all the fullness of God dwells within him bodily.

284
00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.460
That means he is above all these other authorities, all these other powers,

285
00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.820
all these other rulers,

286
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.780
everything else that they might be tempted to be pulled into,

287
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.820
they are underneath God Almighty.

288
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.250
And so Paul says, Hey guys, remember this is who he is.

289
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.490
So don't turn back to that stuff. You don't need that.

290
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:41.410
You've got God almighty, the fullness of God dwells within him.

291
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.690
And by the way, he says there,

292
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.610
the fullness of God also fills you with everything you will ever need in your

293
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.360
life. So don't, don't seek that stuff.

294
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.360
It's underneath the God you worship.

295
00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.880
Now, that's just verse nine. There's more to this, right? Look further. Why?

296
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.600
Why should we revere God? Verse 11

297
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.730
in him, that's in Jesus. Also,

298
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:14.010
you were circumcised with the circumcision made without hands by putting off the

299
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.650
body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ.

300
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.490
And so he's talking again about the circumcision stuff. He's,

301
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.730
he's talking here about a spiritual circumcision that has nothing to do with

302
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:25.040
physical flesh.

303
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.490
It's cutting off the old sinful self that each one of us has.

304
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.900
And he's saying again to those people who would say, no,

305
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.540
you gotta be Jewish to be a Christian. No,

306
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.910
that's not what it's about anymore.

307
00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.030
It's about the power of God to redeem sinners and mark them off himself.

308
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.030
How did he do that? He did that through his death where he,

309
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.960
he in a sense put off the body of flesh in his death.

310
00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.280
He cut off the flesh so that the new covenant,

311
00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.440
he could give us new hearts,

312
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.960
cut off the flesh sin of our hearts and say, here's something new.

313
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:09.150
That's what God does. Revere him,

314
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.740
talked about baptism. We got to celebrate that earlier in both services.

315
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.180
Praise God for that. But verse 12, he says it this way,

316
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.460
having been buried with him in baptism,

317
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.060
in which you are also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of

318
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.180
God who raised him from the dead.

319
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.660
So he does the same thing we do every time we baptize someone.

320
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:31.940
This is a tangible picture of the death and resurrection of Christ

321
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.060
that his death and resurrection is,

322
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.020
is creating a spiritual reality inside you. Not baptism itself,

323
00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.620
but what it points to is what God does inside you.

324
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.400
And so think about it just like you saw when you go under the water,

325
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.520
it's a sign that you've already identified with the death of Christ on your

326
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.420
behalf. When you come up outta the water,

327
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.140
it's a sign that you've already identified with the resurrection of Christ on

328
00:21:59.140 --> 00:21:59.973
your behalf.

329
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:05.040
And then all of that is done in faith, right? He says,

330
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.000
faith is what saves done in faith that one day fully,

331
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.040
he's going to resurrect your body.

332
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:16.040
Just like Jesus' was resurrected 2000 years ago. Like you're saying, God,

333
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.840
I believe that just like this symbolizes your death and resurrection someday I

334
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.440
get to be resurrected to you did it first. I get to do it someday as well.

335
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.260
And I believe in that. And so in other words,

336
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.340
Paul says to the Colossians, Hey,

337
00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.980
if the God you say you worship can do all of that,

338
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:40.350
why turn back to anything else? Why do you need all the worldly philosophies?

339
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.830
Why do you need any of that other stuff? You've got all of this.

340
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.390
Don't get sucked back into that worldly stuff that's useless.

341
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.050
It's not even done. Verse 13, he talks to the Gentile Colossians,

342
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:58.850
especially because the Jews saw the Gentiles as, as in in a sense,

343
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.010
dead because they're outside of the covenant.

344
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.410
And then, so Paul says this in verse 13. He says,

345
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:11.410
you who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your

346
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.210
flesh, that's the Jews saw them since they were uncircumcised. You're outside,

347
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:20.170
you're dead. And then you add this trespasses that that because we're sinners,

348
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.410
were spiritually dead. Man that puts the Gentiles in a bad place, doesn't it?

349
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.830
You're dead 'cause you're outside the covenant.

350
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.350
You're dead because you're a sinner in general. Like you are dead.

351
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:38.460
No hope yet. Verse 13 doesn't stop there.

352
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.580
God made you alive together with Jesus having forgiven us

353
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.040
all our trespasses, right? Just like God,

354
00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.320
the Father reached into the life of the body of Jesus and made him alive.

355
00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:56.160
He makes you alive spiritually by forgiving us our trespasses. So Paul saying,

356
00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.240
Hey, Colossians, hey, hey Colossians, remember

357
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.440
it was Christ, it was Father,

358
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.240
it was God who made you alive spiritually.

359
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:11.010
None of the other stuff did those gods, those philosophies, they don't work.

360
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.150
God made you alive. So don't turn back to any of it.

361
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.840
Christ is enough. Don't turn back.

362
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.720
But you think, okay, God forgives sin. How does he do that?

363
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.000
Like does God just kind of, you know,

364
00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.800
sweep it under the rug and kind of forget that it's even there?

365
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.160
Does he do any of that stuff? Like kinda ignore it? Is that how he forgives?

366
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.280
No. Look at verse 14,

367
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.130
forgiven us all our trespasses by canceling the record of debt that stood

368
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.690
against us with its legal demands. This he set aside,

369
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.530
nailing it to the cross.

370
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.090
This is most likely referring to the law of God,

371
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.310
which says that if we've broken any of it, we're guilty of breaking all of it.

372
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.640
So we have a record of debt. So, so imagine, here's the picture.

373
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.820
You're sitting in a courtroom and, and you're sitting there with,

374
00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.190
with this record a debt.

375
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.390
And it doesn't matter how much you've tried to balance the scales,

376
00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.070
it doesn't matter how much good you've tried to do to overcome that.

377
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.310
You sit there because of that record, guilty,

378
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:35.010
you've sinned against God. You are guilty, you have a debt,

379
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.850
and that debt is a debt that you can't pay back.

380
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.970
It's a chasm that you can't cross. It's a ransom that you could never pay.

381
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:50.670
But God can Right? Hear that you can't pay it,

382
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:55.030
you can't do it. God can, right? 'cause what does it say This, this record,

383
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.270
this guilty verdict. He set aside, nailing it to the cross.

384
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.870
Man, I got this picture this week. This is like it.

385
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:08.470
God took that guilty verdict. The rap sheet of all the stuff you've ever done,

386
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.430
all the guilty things that you are guilty for, right?

387
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.190
All the sins you've done against God. He took that rap sheet.

388
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.110
And just think about, think about the stacks of paper that would be,

389
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:22.110
just think about how deep that rap sheet is that you have.

390
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.390
Because if you're sending us God for your whole life and even the future ones

391
00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.610
you're gonna do, he took that

392
00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:35.240
and he put it up here on the wood of the cross,

393
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.960
put Jesus' hand in front of it. And as that nail was going through Jesus' wrist,

394
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.360
that hammer was hitting it not only through that,

395
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.400
but through that whole guilty verdict into that wood on your behalf,

396
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.430
right? That's what this says.

397
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.340
The stacks and stacks. Listen,

398
00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.620
I know you're sitting here and some of you're like, I've done too much.

399
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.010
It doesn't matter how deep that stack is, it still goes through into the wood.

400
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.570
I know you're sitting there and you're thinking, I, I've gone too far.

401
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.070
And you're thinking about that thing that you hope nobody finds out about,

402
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:18.130
that you hope, nobody ever knows about. Listen,

403
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.570
God watched you do that.

404
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.560
And if you believe in him in your place, that's what happens.

405
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:33.600
That guilty, whatever gets there, Jesus' nail goes through his hand,

406
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.400
through that into the wood and it's carried, set aside, right? What a God

407
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:44.300
do you see this? What a God we serve. He's not just loving us,

408
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.260
he's not just forgiving us.

409
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.980
He's also paying the price for those sins that you and I commit against him.

410
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.580
He sets it aside. That word means erase.

411
00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:59.850
It's gone. It's been nailed to the cross. It's finished

412
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.450
this. Do you see why Paul is saying to the Colossians,

413
00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.690
Hey revere this God revere him because of all that he's done.

414
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.950
Because here's what that brings. Verse 15,

415
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:18.510
he disarmed as he did that he disarmed the rulers and authorities put

416
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:23.390
them to open shame by triumphing over them in him. That's a victory parade,

417
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.470
that word triumph.

418
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.680
He paraded them through shaming them.

419
00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.960
Listen, this is what, this is what I, I heard I read about this week.

420
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.480
Everything they tried to do to Jesus, he did to them.

421
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:45.120
They stripped him naked. They shamed him.

422
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:50.110
They tried to take away his power by putting him on that cross.

423
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:57.370
And yet as they did that, Jesus stripped them.

424
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.770
He showed them shame. And he showed them to be powerless.

425
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:08.590
In the very act of them trying to overcome him, he overcame them.

426
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.790
That is the truth and the beauty of what we've seen, all of that,

427
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.990
everything from verses nine through 15,

428
00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.750
all of that is why Paul said in verse eight,

429
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.190
see to it that no one takes you captive by anything else.

430
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:29.180
Don't be held captive by anything else. You've seen the power of God.

431
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.060
You've been freed by the power of God. You've been made alive in God.

432
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.900
So don't turn back to your dead captivity.

433
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.920
None of those things are philosophies or powers or anything can give you life.

434
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.120
The only way you find life is in Christ. Who is your life. Colossians three,

435
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:48.953
four says,

436
00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:56.560
this week, a church member pointed out to me how the word captive here

437
00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.350
reminds us of Israel. So many times in the Old Testament,

438
00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.330
especially in the wilderness, especially on Mount Sinai,

439
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.250
and you'll get to that here in a second, but just think about this,

440
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.690
the Israelites, they were captives in Egypt. They were slaves.

441
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.930
They were held in captivity by, uh, Egypt.

442
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:21.270
Yet they saw the power of God to free them through the

443
00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:25.710
10 plagues, through the splitting of the Red Sea to free them from captivity.

444
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:32.670
Yet as Moses went up on the mountain to receive the covenant

445
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:37.390
expectations from God what was happening at the base of the mountain,

446
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:45.520
they immediately, it says, began fashioning an idol,

447
00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.440
a golden calf. And they pointed to it and said, this is our God now.

448
00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:56.930
And all over the Old Testament, you see them say this phrase, in essence,

449
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:02.250
we, we wanna go back to Egypt, we want to go back.

450
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:08.310
It was better in Egypt. We want to go back to Egypt. This is our God,

451
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.143
we wanna go back.

452
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.950
It's like they had spiritual amnesia,

453
00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.590
they had ungrateful hearts. They'd forgotten the character of God.

454
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.870
They'd forgotten what God had done for them. And so,

455
00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.990
so how did God respond in that moment? Did he just write 'em off,

456
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.830
kicked them out, said, forget you, I'm gonna go find some new people.

457
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:31.830
Is that what he did? No,

458
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:37.760
he disciplined them and then he called them back,

459
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.680
invited them back, said, come back to me. Follow me.

460
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.490
Remember what I've done, the whole story, that Old Testament is this,

461
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.970
this cycle of how God looks at them,

462
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.570
calls them back, redeems them.

463
00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.640
They follow him for a while and then they forget again. And they forget.

464
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.080
And they move back to these other idols and other falsehoods and,

465
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.880
and principles and powers. And they,

466
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.920
they get disciplined and God brings 'em back, calls 'em back,

467
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.680
and then they follow for a while and then they forget and they go back and they

468
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.400
seek more. It's just over and over and over and over again.

469
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:21.170
But I'm so glad that you and I are not like that, right?

470
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.720
We would never do that.

471
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:33.570
We would never turn our back on God and forget all that he's done for us

472
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.450
and turn to all this other silliness. We'd never do that, right?

473
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.000
We've gone so far, we've, we've progressed.

474
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.020
No, you know, I'm being facetious on that, right?

475
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.890
This is the story of every single one of us.

476
00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.700
This is what you and I do. Every one of us. And, and listen,

477
00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:01.660
maybe you're still dead in your sin and you're not even aware of coming

478
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.370
to God.

479
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:06.740
This is my prayer today is that you would see God rightly in Christ today,

480
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.500
all that he's done for you. You would turn to him in faith and say, I'm all in.

481
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.280
I need you. I can't do it myself. I'm exhausted.

482
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.400
I'm tired of chasing all this other stuff to try to find my fulfillment.

483
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.360
It's not happening.

484
00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:25.440
My prayer is that you see him and you turn to this redeeming, restoring,

485
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.560
renewing, victorious God that he is.

486
00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.520
But for all of us who are already believers, already

487
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.200
every one of us is prone to this, to the same things.

488
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.920
The Colossians were tempted by what Israel did in the wilderness. John Calvin,

489
00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.840
he said that our hearts are idol factories.

490
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.840
We just keep creating new idols, coming up with new things to chase and pursue.

491
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.080
And this is gonna fulfill me. This is gonna fulfill me.

492
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.400
And we chase after all of it,

493
00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:00.960
we drift from this reverence of God to all these worldly philosophies and

494
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.793
principles.

495
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.180
And so we chase, after every Instagram influencer that sounds good,

496
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.840
appeals to us in some way, that that's gonna be the fulfillment or,

497
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.600
or every new gadget that we see come up on Amazon.

498
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.000
Or we gotta buy that and buy that, that's gonna fulfill this. Or,

499
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.480
or we gotta keep up with the new house every couple years because that's the

500
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.920
image I need to have for other people.

501
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.360
Or we, we pick a talking head on TV and that becomes the truth.

502
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.520
And everything about it they say is absolutely right.

503
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.940
Or or the, the spiritual gurus on TikTok that just sound like, man, this,

504
00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:45.540
this sounds good. That sure seems to make logical sense.

505
00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.020
I think that's what I need to believe.

506
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.920
Or every theological shift made to

507
00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.080
affirm our sinful behavior.

508
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.650
Listen, young people especially,

509
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:11.090
but all of us are prone to this. Hear me?

510
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:16.750
You are tempted right now to create your own truth all over the place.

511
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.390
Truth is not something you create. Hear me.

512
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:27.670
Truth is something you discover because there's only one.

513
00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:32.150
You can't have your truth and their truth and they compete somehow. It,

514
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:35.900
it is not true. Right? It it, it's,

515
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:40.840
it's discovering the truth. That's what we're talking about here.

516
00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.160
We do all of those things.

517
00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.960
We chase after all these worldly principles and philosophies.

518
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.960
'cause we think somehow that's gonna satisfy us.

519
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.220
But those are all deceitful,

520
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.460
worldly philosophies and principles they can never satisfy.

521
00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.420
They can never fulfill you. No matter what it feels like,

522
00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.620
what you think about it, it will never satisfy.

523
00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.060
The only thing that can fill you is the one who made you.

524
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:11.650
The only one who can fill you is the one who created you. The one listen.

525
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:16.370
The one in whom the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, the head of all else,

526
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:21.610
the resurrector, the giver of new life, the victor over all things.

527
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.050
Like when you think about that, is there ever any really comparison here?

528
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:30.250
Is there really any comparison? Paul's saying to them, Hey guys,

529
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:34.370
remember this is who God is. And don't forget, you already know this God,

530
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.730
you already know him. So why do you need to turn back to all this other stuff?

531
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.560
You're not sitting back here trying to make objective decisions. Well,

532
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.240
this one makes right. This one makes right. This seems right. Like no,

533
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:50.560
you already know. If you're in Christ, you know him already. So don't turn away.

534
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.980
Why would you walk back into slavery in captivity

535
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:57.540
when you have freedom?

536
00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:05.190
He's already put all those things to shame. He's already proved them powerless,

537
00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:06.750
proved them worthless.

538
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.270
So

539
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.103
Why go back?

540
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.970
As I've already said, it's the same for us today though, right?

541
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.760
And so the question we need to ask, why do we keep doing it?

542
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.940
Why do we keep going back? Why do we keep drifting?

543
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.940
Why do we keep thinking about this is better than this that we have in Christ?

544
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:30.953
Why?

545
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.650
Because not only do we have spiritual amnesia, we have gospel amnesia.

546
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.290
We forget this gospel.

547
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:47.890
And we instead begin to think on the worldly philosophies and sin and

548
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:52.730
temptations. And that's where we get our minds focused instead of remembering.

549
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.730
And so church, listen, this is why we gather here.

550
00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.270
This is why this is essential for us.

551
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.550
That's why your time in the word by yourself daily,

552
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.750
regularly is essential. That's why time with brothers and sisters is essential.

553
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.550
Because you and I need to be reminded of these things.

554
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:16.630
We quickly forget, we quickly run away. We forget.

555
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:21.040
And so we needed to be reminded every day. Well,

556
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.320
lemme remind you today of this gospel truth,

557
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.660
That Jesus lived the perfect life you should have lived.

558
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.420
He died the death you deserved for that sin.

559
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.540
And he defeated the enemy of sin and death by coming outta the grave alive on

560
00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.880
the third day. And now he sits ascended,

561
00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.280
reigning over all things and he's coming back one day, right?

562
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.280
That is the gospel that he has done that to forgive you and to free you

563
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.880
from the captivity of your sin. That's what he's done for you church.

564
00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.480
Remember that? And so hear that when you remember that.

565
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:53.920
What you need to remember is that whatever he's tempting you with right now,

566
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:57.650
he's already overcome it. He's already defeated it, right?

567
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.050
If that's the truth of the gospel,

568
00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:02.410
you don't need to be sucked into what the enemy's tempting you know,

569
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.273
he's already won

570
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:09.660
whatever is reminding you of the deadness of your past.

571
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:11.953
You

572
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:16.030
Need to remember that Christ has made you alive. You're already alive.

573
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.590
You're not dead anymore. You're alive.

574
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:25.080
Whatever's claiming a debt against you. No, you're still guilty.

575
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:26.880
You've gone too far,

576
00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.760
you've done too much whatever's claiming a debt against you. See this.

577
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.200
He's already nailed it to the cross. Remember,

578
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.670
this is the truth of the gospel. So hear me.

579
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.190
Don't be held captive by any of that stuff.

580
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:43.930
You are free from it.

581
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:49.610
If you have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ in your place, you are free.

582
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.530
Stop going back to captivity

583
00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.990
and listen, be full of gratitude for that too, right?

584
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:03.483
Oh man,

585
00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.870
If this is who God is and this is what he has done,

586
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.670
be full of gratitude.

587
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:16.190
We don't deserve any of it. We couldn't earn any of it,

588
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.550
and we regularly turn away from it.

589
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:25.990
And yet God in His grace has saved us. He's redeemed us.

590
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.270
He's made us new like, oh man,

591
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:36.370
grateful heart. That's why Paul says here abounding in thanks, giving.

592
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.930
That's what should completely change our lives.

593
00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:44.490
A life filled with gratitude.

594
00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.293
Listen,

595
00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:54.120
the less that we reflect on what God has done for us,

596
00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:01.000
the quicker we run to all these other things and forget the gospel.

597
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:08.170
But the more we reflect on the good news of Christ,

598
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.570
the more we think about it, the slower our eyes drift to other things,

599
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:16.670
The slower we,

600
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:22.110
we see our our lives look opposed to Christ.

601
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:26.350
The more we reflect on his grace, the more our faith is rooted,

602
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.590
built up in Him and established in him. The more we reflect,

603
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.990
the more we remember, the more we'll gratefully,

604
00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.040
gratefully walk in him just as we've received him.

605
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.400
The more we reflect on the gospel, more,

606
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.360
we're reminded of who he is and what he's done,

607
00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.720
the more we're going to share that faith with people at school,

608
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.640
with people at work, people in our home, people here at church,

609
00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.320
and for some of you to the ends of the earth as well.

610
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.740
That's why here

611
00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:59.430
we focus way more on what he has done for you

612
00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:05.500
over what you need to do for him or do differently in your life.

613
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.370
Because our only sure foundation is what he's already done rather than how well

614
00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:12.610
we're gonna do at this thing, right?

615
00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.710
And because we so quickly forget,

616
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:21.750
we need to be reminded over and over and over of this

617
00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:25.910
gospel that he is our solid foundation, that he is the one who's changed us,

618
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:30.310
that he is doing a work in us. There's no need. Hear me.

619
00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:35.550
There's no need to fall back into the captivity of

620
00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:39.200
worldly principles and philosophies. He's enough.

621
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.600
So let's live for him in that.
