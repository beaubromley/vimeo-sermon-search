1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.400
Who is

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.700
the god like Yahweh the god

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.500
of wrath the god of Mercy The

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.000
God Who reaches down to unworthy

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.200
people.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.500
Well, it is so great to see you church. I'm thankful that

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.300
at least a few of you have started up your thread game a

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.300
little bit with me on these last sermons of the series like this.

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
This is a tradition. I started now almost

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.400
12 years ago where out in Trinity

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.700
Baptist Church and Weatherford Oklahoma my first Pastor it we

12
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.800
began this because I I started

13
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.300
my pastor by preaching through the entire book of Ephesians and

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.100
I thought it was John mccarthur or something because I

15
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.000
was like 26 sermons through the whole book and it was limping to

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.300
the Finish Line where I was like man, I got to honor

17
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.200
their endurance through this thing and so we decided to

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.800
do this and it's just kind of stuck with it. And so it's fun but

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.800
thinking about sermons the hardest

20
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.200
part of any sermon is the conclusion the ending

21
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.700
It's like flying a plane The Landing is the the

22
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.500
most important part the most complicated part most

23
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.200
difficult part. I was I was with a

24
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.100
man in our church flying around in his little Cessna and and

25
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.700
I know I understand that taking off and cruising

26
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.000
it out. There's there's more to it than what it

27
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.400
seems like but I know for sure that the landing

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
is the most involved and most critical part.

29
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.300
It's the same with the sermon.

30
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.700
Like you can have a great flight.

31
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.300
And then as you get close to the airport, you just start circling and

32
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.600
circling and circling and then you can you can crash land

33
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.200
that thing and what do people walk out remembering of course,

34
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.900
is that Landing?

35
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.500
Even a serious can be similar to that. Whereas we

36
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.200
have now spent 13 weeks in the Book

37
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.000
of Micah in the Old Testament.

38
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.000
It's been so powerful.

39
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.400
It's been really challenging but now we've come to the end.

40
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.300
I actually thought about like playing The Boys to Men song

41
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.500
into the road, but I didn't think I'd be appropriate right now. You know,

42
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.800
that's the end of the

43
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.900
Road because I can't like I can't let go. I don't know so seriously, but

44
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.300
but as intimidating as this book was like

45
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.600
to me walking into this now a

46
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.000
few months ago.

47
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.300
As difficult as it has been to hear some of the things that God says to

48
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.100
us in it.

49
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.100
It's been such a sweet study.

50
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.100
I've been so good and I want to avoid Crash Landing this thing and so

51
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.500
I wanted to end well for us.

52
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.800
Well, thankfully the book itself comes to a beautiful conclusion.

53
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.100
I don't have to work very hard. It does it itself and

54
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.400
so take your copy of God's word and turn with me.

55
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.600
to the end of Micah

56
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.100
for the final time in this series Micah chapter

57
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.500
7 the very end last couple verses.

58
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.700
Now before we conclude this powerful book, we need to quickly review

59
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.200
where we've come so far.

60
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.400
Some of you might be jumping into this out of nowhere or at least just a

61
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400
refresher for all of us.

62
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.400
We need to review where we've come and so we started this

63
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.500
whole thing by asking the question who is like

64
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.200
Yahweh.

65
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.800
Who is like Yahweh?

66
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.500
Do you remember why we asked that question at the beginning?

67
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.300
Because that's what the name Micah actually

68
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.800
means.

69
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.300
Who is like Yahweh. That's what his

70
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.600
very name is that from before Micah was even born

71
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.700
God called him as a prophet to

72
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.400
his people to the southern Kingdom of Judah primarily.

73
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.500
He did speak to the north, but mostly to the South and in

74
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.100
his very name Micah.

75
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.800
God chose Micah to be the one to call God's

76
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.700
people back to him.

77
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.000
Call God's people back to live this holy life

78
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.200
this set apart life. Micah was

79
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.400
primarily used for that purpose to remind

80
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.300
these people who God is and what he

81
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.600
says to them and then

82
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.200
In memory of who he is,

83
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200
they should turn away from their idols and turn back to follow him.

84
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.800
That was a whole life Micah lived.

85
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.200
But in light of who God is as he

86
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.500
showed himself through this book that he's utterly distinct. He's holy

87
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.100
he's different.

88
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.500
It led us to the second question, which was who can

89
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.400
then Ascend to Yahweh.

90
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.400
Who is like Yahweh, but then who can ever

91
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.500
Ascend to him? That's the main image.

92
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.300
We've had throughout this entire series.

93
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.300
That right off the bat you remember in chapter 1 God comes down from his

94
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.000
holy mountain.

95
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.600
He descends to his people to judge

96
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.300
the Nations.

97
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.600
All of chapter one is Judgment that he is all-powerful.

98
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.900
He's lifted up high above everything. He's perfectly spotless.

99
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.100
And yet he came down to say you are not.

100
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.600
But one day he's going to renew and restore that

101
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.200
mountain as the dwelling place of

102
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.700
him and his people again, and so we are forced to

103
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.300
ask the question. Okay, how do we get there?

104
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.300
Like we want to be there with God. How do we get there who can

105
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.200
Ascend to that mountain of God to be with him? How

106
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.100
do we get there? Is it is it our effort?

107
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.400
Can we climb that mountain and get to him or or does

108
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.900
he somehow bring us up there with him?

109
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.500
That question was it behind the entire book of

110
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.500
Micah's who can Ascend to be with him?

111
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.700
We saw God's heart his character.

112
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.700
That he had empathy for the outcast. He desired

113
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.300
Purity in his people. And so the question then is

114
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.600
who can ever be with God if that's who he is.

115
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.600
Because we're not like that.

116
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.400
And we've seen hints of the answer throughout the book thankfully.

117
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.700
But it's really all been building to what we're going to see today in this

118
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.100
chapter.

119
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.400
Before we get there though. There's a third question. We've been asking throughout Micah.

120
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.300
In light of who God is in light of who he's called us as

121
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.400
his people to be will we then live for

122
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.500
him?

123
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.200
Who is like him who can Ascend to him will we then live

124
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.500
for him?

125
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.400
If we are his people if we claim to be as people

126
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.100
will live lives marked by his heart.

127
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.400
Changed by his character loving what he loves being

128
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.500
like him.

129
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.000
Because remember what Judah had been doing.

130
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.100
They've been stealing Land from the poor they'd been

131
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.400
taking bribes flaunting their evil. Deeds

132
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.300
cheating each other with deceitful weights. They

133
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.700
were worshiping Idols. They were playing with sorcery. They

134
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.100
were abandoning God in every way.

135
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.900
They were opposed. It was there's this old word antigoglin

136
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.400
that says that they were on they were not close

137
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.900
to what God wanted.

138
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.800
They were at odds with what he wanted their

139
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.000
crooked. You might say.

140
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.000
That's why Micah's call in Micah 6:8. If you

141
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.900
remember his call to act justly to love being

142
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.200
faithful to one another to walk humbly with

143
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.500
Yahweh. That's why it was so prophetic to

144
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.000
his people.

145
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.500
Because Micah was not comfortably surrounded by

146
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.400
those who agreed with him about those people

147
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.900
out there.

148
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.400
Like he's just tossing red meat to his fans like yeah, they're

149
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.400
terrible aren't they? And he's throwing throwing through no, he's turning around

150
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.600
and speaking God's truth to those who were supposed to be God's

151
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.700
people.

152
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.000
That's true Prophet. That's true prophetic Ministry.

153
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.600
Is when you're confronting your own people.

154
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.000
about their faults

155
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.400
That they were called to live lives of Holiness. They were

156
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.100
called the point other nations around them to Yahweh, but

157
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.700
they were not.

158
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.500
And so what was their hope then?

159
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.400
They've hit this place of crisis.

160
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.300
God has called them out repeatedly. If God is Holy if

161
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.500
God's on his holy mountain and if we're not holy what

162
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.200
hope do we have to ever be with him they were

163
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:12.400
saying

164
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.100
Same for us since all of sin and fall short of the glory of

165
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.300
God and we are due his wrath the

166
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.100
wages of sin is death. What hope do we have to be

167
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.200
with God ever again?

168
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.700
Well, that's how Micah concludes the book.

169
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.600
As we've reviewed the entire thing. This is how he concludes it.

170
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.700
He started with the character of God.

171
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.800
He infused the character of God throughout the book.

172
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.400
And now he lands the plane with the character of

173
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:45.500
God.

174
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.400
It's just about who God is.

175
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.700
But here's the difference.

176
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.400
He doesn't talk about the character of God in this way at this time at

177
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.600
the end of the book. He doesn't talk about it in a way to infuse

178
00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.600
Terror into us.

179
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.900
He's not saying these things.

180
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.300
To say this is God be afraid of him. He's saying this is

181
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.100
who I know God to be.

182
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.300
Even towards sinful people like you and me. He's saying

183
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.200
I know who God is look at who he is verses 18

184
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.800
through 20.

185
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.300
Who is a God Like You?

186
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.400
Pardoning iniquity passing over

187
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.100
transgression for the remnant of his inheritance.

188
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.000
He does not retain his anger forever.

189
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.200
Because he Delights instead fast, love.

190
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.400
He will again have compassion on us. He will

191
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.500
tread our iniquities underfoot.

192
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.500
You God will cast all our sins into the depths of

193
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.300
the sea. You will show faithfulness to

194
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.900
Jacob and steadfast. Love to Abraham as you

195
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.300
have sworn to our fathers from the days of

196
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:55.700
old.

197
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.500
What a landing, right?

198
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.600
Beautiful powerful life-giving words to

199
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.400
land This Plane, but did you see how he began

200
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.000
the section?

201
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.300
Verse 18, he asked the question who is a

202
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.000
God Like You

203
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.700
this is the sandwich to his name at the beginning who

204
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.200
said who is like Yahweh. Now, he asked the question

205
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.100
at the very end. This book end. He says who's a God

206
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.500
Like You

207
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.300
Who is like Yahweh, who is a God Like You?

208
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.100
but notice

209
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.300
That this question this time is not asked in

210
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.800
a fearful kind of way, like what can ever who

211
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.800
could ever be with God like who is like Yahweh

212
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.200
and we're terrified of it. This is almost in an excited

213
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.300
kind of way like who is like Yahweh.

214
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.800
Who is like this God?

215
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.400
Who is like yeah, because everything he

216
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.800
writes after this these last three verses it's

217
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.900
positive, right?

218
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.600
that this is

219
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.200
a God who is utterly unique?

220
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.400
because of what he does for his people

221
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.600
Who is like this guy?

222
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.500
There's no other God like this.

223
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.000
Who is forgiving like this restoring like

224
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.000
this forgetting like this responding

225
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.300
like this? Who is like Yahweh, right?

226
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.100
But again, that's the whole point.

227
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.600
Micah was wanting his people to remember what

228
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.000
they had that nobody else had.

229
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.000
Not to become arrogant about that but to be changed by

230
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.600
that reality.

231
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.200
Mike is like God. Do you remember this is our God.

232
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.200
So be different live differently in light of

233
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.200
this not take it for granted and wander off

234
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.800
into your own selfish Pursuits Judah. You should remember

235
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.300
and draw near.

236
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.900
Is it not the same for us today?

237
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.300
Is this not the same challenge for us today?

238
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.500
That's why we keep coming back to the gospel to the

239
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.100
good news of the life death and resurrection of

240
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.400
Jesus in our place.

241
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.700
That he paid the price for our sins to remind us

242
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.300
of that to be changed by that.

243
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.200
Are someone compare it to one of those old Coke

244
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:29.600
machines?

245
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.200
Now sometimes when you would put your quarter in

246
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.100
there, it would get kind of stuck about two inches down in there.

247
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.600
So, what did you do?

248
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.400
You banged on the side over and over and over again until it

249
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.400
finally dropped down in there and you got your Coke out.

250
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.400
Kids, I know they do don't have coins anymore and

251
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.000
many machine I get that but it used to happen that way.

252
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.500
But that's what someone said that you have to do with the

253
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.300
gospel. We keep banging it into our heads

254
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.900
until it finally drops down into our hearts and produces the

255
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.500
good fruit that God wants it to produce.

256
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.200
We forget Paul Tripp said we have gospel amnesia.

257
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.100
And we just keep forgetting. This is who God is this is

258
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.200
what he's done and we've got to keep coming back to it

259
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.500
because the whole book of Mike.

260
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.400
Is the story of Judah for getting who God is?

261
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.500
Running off into all kinds of other things

262
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.600
trying to find life in

263
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.600
all those other things.

264
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.900
When they had already had life.

265
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:35.700
in him

266
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.300
They kept forgetting that God is who he

267
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.700
says he is in Exodus 34 verses 6

268
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.700
and 7.

269
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.500
God himself says the Lord Yahweh a

270
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.600
god merciful and gracious.

271
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.600
Slow to anger abounding and steadfast

272
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.600
love and faithfulness.

273
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.000
Keeping steadfast love for thousands forgiving iniquity

274
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.000
and transgression and sin.

275
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.500
But who will by no means clear the guilty.

276
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.300
Visiting the iniquity of the fathers and the children and the children's

277
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.900
children to the third and the fourth generation.

278
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.800
Micah wanted the people to remember that

279
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.400
That this is who our God is.

280
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.400
draw near to Him He blesses to thousands Generations

281
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.600
but if you turn away from him he's going to

282
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.000
Visit judgment on you and your children.

283
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.200
They needed to remember and be changed by

284
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.500
that picture.

285
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.400
That's why Micah in these three verses

286
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.300
at the end of chapter 7. He taught a master class and

287
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.100
who Yahweh is

288
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.200
He paints a beautiful picture.

289
00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.700
Of even just two aspects of God's

290
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.300
character.

291
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.000
His mercy and his sovereignty.

292
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.600
That his mercy and sovereignty to facets of

293
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.700
the Lord that should lead us to a deep Abiding Love

294
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.900
for God.

295
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.800
But also a deep abiding faith in God.

296
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.800
Because this is why the Lord is so utterly unique.

297
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.700
among all the gods

298
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.900
first because he forgives our sin.

299
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.800
Who is like Yahweh?

300
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.900
That he forgives our sin.

301
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.600
I mean look again at this string of stunning forgiveness

302
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.500
metaphors.

303
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.600
Look at verses 18 and 19 Micah 7 again.

304
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.600
Who is a God Like You?

305
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.800
Pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression

306
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.500
for the remnant of his inheritance.

307
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.900
He does not retain his anger forever because he Delights in

308
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.600
steadfast love.

309
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.200
He will again have compassion on us. He'll tread our

310
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.400
iniquities our sins underfoot and he

311
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.700
will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.

312
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.900
Like wow, right who is like Yahweh.

313
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.700
Just look at all that it says about him first he pardons

314
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.400
iniquity.

315
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.600
The image we get here is the removal of Sin from

316
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.500
someone and the putting of that sin on

317
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:30.900
someone else.

318
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.100
so that word means

319
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.700
it's what the suffering servant does in Isaiah 53.

320
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.700
We're in verse 4. It says he has borne our griefs and

321
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.400
carried our sorrows.

322
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.500
Leading to verse 11 where he shall bear their

323
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.300
iniquities.

324
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.200
That means he takes them off and puts them

325
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:53.500
on.

326
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.300
Off us on to him. That's the pardoning there.

327
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.700
In other words what that means is that someone must die for sin.

328
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.300
Either you or a sufficient substitute who

329
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.200
can pardon you.

330
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.800
He pardons God Yahweh pardons our iniquities.

331
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.000
He passes over transgression it says.

332
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.700
The image we get here is overlooking a fault.

333
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.700
Which essentially just means forgiveness, right?

334
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.800
Yes, you've done it but I'm going to overlook pass

335
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.200
over it. Now. This is not arbitrary doesn't happen

336
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.000
for everyone because it says this forgiveness is

337
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.900
only reserved for his remnant.

338
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.400
His inheritance meaning those who are his by

339
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.400
faith. That's who he forgives.

340
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.300
Keep going in chapter 7. He says God does not

341
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.400
retain his anger forever because he Delights instead

342
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.400
fast. Love.

343
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.500
Kids remember this whole series we've had this one Hebrew

344
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.600
word coming up that you got to get the throat into right? Yes

345
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.800
said, right that's this idea of steadfast love.

346
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.200
It shows up all over my cup. It actually shows up all

347
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.500
over the Old Testament, too.

348
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.600
Primary word to show God's merciful love

349
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.700
for his people.

350
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.500
Which fits well in this concept of pair of Pardon and

351
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.000
forgiveness, right?

352
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.600
It's merciful love. It's steadfast love.

353
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.900
I'm gonna love you no matter what.

354
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.600
But I want you to see something about this here.

355
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.000
Not only does God just tolerate has

356
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.100
said.

357
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.200
What does it say?

358
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.700
He Delights in it.

359
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.900
He Delights in it.

360
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.300
This this struck me this week really heavy. Have

361
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.600
you ever thought of God's mercy like that?

362
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.300
Have you ever thought of God's mercy in that way

363
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.300
that he is excited to forgive you.

364
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.700
I think what most of us grew up thinking is

365
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.500
our picture of God is one of disgust.

366
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.200
towards us

367
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.900
that he's up there just ticked off on us all the time.

368
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200
But but do you see this?

369
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.400
This says he Delights in triumphing over judgment with

370
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.000
Mercy.

371
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.700
He Delights in that it's what Isaiah 30 Verse

372
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.700
18 says so beautifully therefore the

373
00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.300
Lord waits to be gracious to you.

374
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.200
And therefore he exalts himself to show

375
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.200
Mercy to you.

376
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.600
For the Lord is a God of Justice. Yes.

377
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.300
But blessed are all those who wait for him.

378
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.900
Because he waits to show Grace to us.

379
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.500
This is steadfast love

380
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.200
don't think of him in the other way think of him as this way.

381
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.400
He's delighting and showing forgiveness to you.

382
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.800
And Micah says here's why because Yahweh has compassion

383
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.100
on his people.

384
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.100
That word compassion is a word that pictures how a mother yearns

385
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.800
for her child.

386
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.500
The idea that God yearns for his people. This

387
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.500
is his heart toward his people. He's not angry at

388
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.400
his people. He has Grace towards him. He wants

389
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.100
to show Mercy towards them.

390
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.200
There's even more to this Micah 7 also says

391
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.500
he Treads our iniquities our sins under his feet.

392
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.300
You've seen the the oak trees dropping their leaves and

393
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.600
the acorns right now. Imagine as you would

394
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.300
walk over those things and kind of crush them

395
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.200
under your feet as you're walking over your yard or over

396
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.700
the sidewalk. That's what God does with our

397
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.500
sins.

398
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.900
Crushing them under his feet.

399
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.200
It's what he does with our sins that he's not just like

400
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.400
averting his eyes and hoping he doesn't notice that

401
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.400
we've sinned. He's actually destroying them

402
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.600
like they're an enemy.

403
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.600
Because that's what they are, right? That's what sin is towards us. They

404
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.700
are an enemy to our soul sin is

405
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.200
something that keeps us from God. It is something that

406
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.900
destroys us and so God has to conquer

407
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.800
that to bring us back to him.

408
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.400
How does he do that?

409
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.500
By sweeping them under the rug and hoping that they don't or pushing

410
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.200
them in the closet and shoving that door closed and hope it doesn't explode

411
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.100
on no. That's not how he does it right? He does it through.

412
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.700
The perfect life death and resurrection of Jesus Christ in

413
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.500
our place paying the penalty for

414
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.300
our sin the full price of it and then

415
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.300
defeating it by coming back out of the Grave alive on

416
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:03.700
the third day.

417
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.800
That's how he conquers sin.

418
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.300
And if all that wasn't enough.

419
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.600
Micah 7:19 says God will cast

420
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.700
all our sins into the depths of the sea.

421
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.300
Which is a common phrase throughout the Old Testament. That means they

422
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.500
are completely gone.

423
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.900
And the image comes from The Exodus you remember how Pharaoh's Army

424
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.200
was chastened God's people out as they they

425
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.200
let him go but then they wanted him back and so they chased after

426
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.900
them and that the people of God are stuck behind between

427
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.400
the Red Sea in front of them and Pharaohs Army

428
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.600
behind them and they're like God, what are we going to do about this?

429
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.800
And God said watch.

430
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.800
Splits the sea open they walk through on dry land and Pharaoh's

431
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.300
Army starts coming through and what happens?

432
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.000
God destroys them.

433
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.500
But not only destroys them. He also throws them

434
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.400
into the depths of the sea.

435
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.800
Where they are never seen again.

436
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.100
That's the image.

437
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.200
Of what God does with our sin our greatest enemy.

438
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.200
He defeats it and throws it away.

439
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.000
Who is a God Like You?

440
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.400
Pardoning iniquity and passing over

441
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.200
transgression for the remnant of his inheritance.

442
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.200
He does not retain his anger forever because he

443
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.100
Delights instead fast. Love.

444
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.600
He will again have compassion on us. He will

445
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.600
tread our iniquities underfoot. You will

446
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.600
cast all our sins into the depths of

447
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.600
the sea. Is that not a beautiful picture of

448
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:47.900
forgiveness?

449
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.800
For a people like Judah who have been so wicked.

450
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.300
So far from God.

451
00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.700
Just gives them hope.

452
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.700
That if they would just turn from their sin and turn to the Lord in faith.

453
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.000
He would forgive them.

454
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.200
He would restore them no matter how far they had

455
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.300
gone. He Delights in being merciful.

456
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.500
Same for you and me today.

457
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.500
Listen if you're sitting in shame right

458
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:26.700
now.

459
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.800
because of your past

460
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.400
or because of your present.

461
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.900
See the heart of God towards you.

462
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.700
See God's heart toward you.

463
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.800
So what Psalm 103?

464
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.400
Verses 11 through 13 says for as

465
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.000
high as the heavens are above the Earth. So great

466
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.100
is his steadfast love. There's that word

467
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.000
again toward those who fear Him

468
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.700
as far as the East is from the West so far.

469
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.000
Does he remove our transgressions from us?

470
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.600
As a father shows compassion to his children. So the

471
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.800
Lord shows compassion to those who fear

472
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.300
Him.

473
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.400
What that means is if you turn to Jesus in your

474
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.900
place, you have a compassionate father who

475
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.900
removes your sin.

476
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.700
And not only does he throw it into the bottom of the ocean. He also

477
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.500
separates you from it. As far as the East

478
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.500
is from the West.

479
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.200
Now now think about that for a second. Why does he not

480
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.800
say as far as the north is from the south?

481
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.600
Because when you think about the globe right no matter

482
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.400
what that NBA player says the Earth is not flat. It's a

483
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.500
globe right like so no matter how far you you can

484
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.900
go north eventually you hit the North Pole and

485
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.600
you go north and then you start going South again.

486
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.500
And you you hit the North Pole you go south you hit the South Pole you start going

487
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.600
north again. So if you say north to south the distance

488
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.000
is about 12,000 miles.

489
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.200
And you can make it that far eventually you can work from

490
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.700
north to south but think about it if you start going east.

491
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.800
You never hit West do you?

492
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.200
You go to infinity and beyond right East keeps going east.

493
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.400
All the way around and around that's as far as

494
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.400
the East is from the West.

495
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.500
That's what he does with your sin.

496
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.900
That's God's heart.

497
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.100
For those who turn to him in faith.

498
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.400
unbeliever

499
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.100
This is the most important thing you could ever hear in your life.

500
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.400
Not because I'm saying it to you but because this

501
00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.900
is what God says to you.

502
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.100
The biggest problem in your life is not a

503
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.000
lack of Education a lack of

504
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.300
Economic Opportunity a lack of of relationships.

505
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.200
Whatever you might say. This

506
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.200
is my issue. The biggest problem in your life is that

507
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.300
you have sinned against a holy God and you if nothing else

508
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.000
changes you are due as judgment.

509
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.500
If I don't say that at arrogance because here's where.

510
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.100
Who we all still see that same God.

511
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.600
Who does Judge sin who is just and

512
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.400
righteous? He also has provided an

513
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.600
opportunity for you to be forgiven of your sins

514
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.300
through the blood of Jesus in your place.

515
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.400
Yes, this is true judgment. But there's also

516
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.800
this offering of the gift of mercy of

517
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.600
not giving you what you deserve because of

518
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.600
your sin of pardoning you taking your

519
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.700
sin off and putting it on Jesus.

520
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.300
And so that's that's you right now. I'm believer. So

521
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.200
right where you are if you see I need that in my life

522
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.100
right where you are. You can with your whole heart. You can

523
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.600
tell the Lord that you've sinned against him that you deserve his

524
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.200
judgment, but you want his forgiveness through Jesus.

525
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.800
And you say to him Jesus you are my only hope in life

526
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.300
and death. I have nothing else. I can't

527
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.900
do it. I need you.

528
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.200
Because this is the kind of God that he

529
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:29.500
is.

530
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.700
that he Delights in Mercy

531
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.600
So don't think you're too far don't think you're too

532
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.200
dirty. He Delights in taking someone

533
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.700
like you.

534
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.600
And making you his child.

535
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.300
Cleaning you up drawing you into his family. That's what

536
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:48.800
he does.

537
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.000
This is who he is.

538
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.800
But listen this also applies to you believer.

539
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.000
Because you might be sitting there in shame.

540
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.400
wallowing in your past

541
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.400
feeling unworthy feeling unloved.

542
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:14.800
hear me friend

543
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.400
this is your

544
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.000
God pardoning

545
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.600
passing over

546
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.200
delighting and mercy

547
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.000
showing compassion

548
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.300
crushing sin and treating us as

549
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.400
if he's completely forgotten our sin.

550
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.200
And so if you truly want him.

551
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.400
If you are truly repentant meaning you

552
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.200
see I am headed towards sin and destruction and

553
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.700
judgment and I don't want that anymore and I'm turning

554
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.400
towards him in faith. Not just kind

555
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.500
of saying I'm sorry God and keep going this way. I turn

556
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.600
to him. This is what he does.

557
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.500
And what that turning does and his filling does is it

558
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.700
gives you the strength to stop living in the bondage and

559
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.700
darkness of sin?

560
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.100
And you can instead live in this freedom.

561
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.400
Of dying to yourself and turning to

562
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.900
him and letting him live his life through you.

563
00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.000
So listen believer, he's not up there.

564
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.500
disappointed in you

565
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.900
disgusted that you're not doing more for him.

566
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.400
Now he loves you Just the Way You Are.

567
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.400
You are his child.

568
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.500
But he also loves you too much to leave you where you are.

569
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.700
Because he's got so much more for you.

570
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.300
He's got so much more truly Abundant Life

571
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.400
for you to live that you were designed to

572
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.100
live. He's got more for you. So yes, he loves

573
00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.400
you right where you are. Don't ever think that you have to earn his love.

574
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.600
He loves you and then he loves you too much to keep

575
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.000
you there.

576
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.700
Which is actually the promise that we get from verse 20.

577
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.800
in Micah 7

578
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.400
Micah's coming in on approach. He's almost done with this

579
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.200
Landing. He's looking to Yahweh. He's seeing

580
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.400
his character.

581
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.500
And in all of this Micah knew for certain that this

582
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.600
is a God who fulfills his promises?

583
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.300
Mercy, and sovereignty were the two things he's talking about and so

584
00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.100
he said God forgives our sins and he fulfills

585
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.200
his promise. This means he never changes.

586
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.700
He never changes the same God who promised

587
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.300
to make Abraham a great nation through which

588
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.200
he'd bless. All the nations is the same God that would

589
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.900
be faithful to bring that promise about someday.

590
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.100
Listen, if you think that God's Gonna back out halfway down the

591
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.500
road to this thing. You've mistaken God.

592
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.400
now to Micah

593
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.000
and to the remnant it might have seemed.

594
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.900
Like God had given up.

595
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.600
But they went back to his promises.

596
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.300
They looked up they looked back. They said God is a

597
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.700
God who fulfills his promises Micah knew

598
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.800
God's character. He trusted in this Yahweh. So

599
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.400
even when he couldn't see the results, he said

600
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.300
I know who God is.

601
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.600
I know this is who God is and so I'm clinging to

602
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.100
him. It's the same for you and me.

603
00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.300
No matter what you are facing no matter

604
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.400
what things look like around us. This is who

605
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.300
our God still is.

606
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.100
He is our salvation.

607
00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.500
He's the God who promised all these things but

608
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.600
he's also the guy who came in the flesh to fulfill all

609
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.300
of these promises some we're going to celebrate over the next few weeks

610
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:09.100
with Advent with Christmas this Incarnation God In

611
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.800
the Flesh coming in glory to

612
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.300
say I'm going to come through on what

613
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.400
I said, I'm gonna come through on

614
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.100
and see this is the god who will one day restore as

615
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.100
Micah's prophesied. He says God is one day going

616
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.500
to restore that mountain.

617
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.200
As his dwelling place as the dwelling place of his

618
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.400
people with him and the only way up there is by God

619
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.600
bringing you up there with him.

620
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:39.300
but one day

621
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.300
it's all gonna be restored. It's all gonna be made right?

622
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.400
Who is a God Like You?

623
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.400
pardoning iniquity

624
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.700
and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance.

625
00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:02.000
He does not retain his anger forever because he Delights instead

626
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.700
fast. Love.

627
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.500
He will again have compassion on us. He will tread

628
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.700
our iniquities underfoot.

629
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.100
You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.

630
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.500
You will show faithfulness to Jacob instead fast.

631
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.300
Love to Abraham as you have sworn to our

632
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.700
fathers from the days of old.

633
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.400
Who is like Yahweh?

634
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:26.600
No.

635
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.700
And so come let us adore him.

636
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.600
And let us give our lives to him all day

637
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.800
every day.

638
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.100
Because he is worthy of it.
