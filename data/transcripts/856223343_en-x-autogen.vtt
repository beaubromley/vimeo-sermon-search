1
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.040
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.880
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

3
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.840
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth

4
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.960
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

5
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.520
When Christ who is your life appears,

6
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.680
then you will also appear with him in glory.

7
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.640
Well, good morning church family.

8
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.640
It's always great to be together in a spirit of worship like this. Uh,

9
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.200
if you're new with us, my name is John. I'm one of the pastors here.

10
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.720
I would love to get to meet you if I haven't yet. Please come say hello to us.

11
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.840
Uh, there's ways you can do that out in the lobby as well or right up here

12
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.680
afterwards. Um, as always, it's an honor to get to open God's word with you. If,

13
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.120
uh, you are new, you may not know.

14
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.800
We just started a series of sermons through the Apostle Paul's letter to the

15
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.440
Colossian Christians in the New Testament. And so we're just getting into that,

16
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.680
being reminded of this truth.

17
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.400
You see it everywhere on the logos that Christ is above all.

18
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.320
Plus, last week you saw, uh,

19
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.680
some things about the book that maybe help us understand as we go into it. Uh,

20
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.560
the many false beliefs that that church that was young in Colossae was facing

21
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.200
was, was assaulting that church.

22
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.520
And so Paul felt it was important for him to write this letter to defend the

23
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.080
gospel. What is the gospel actually in itself,

24
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.600
but then what does it mean and implications for it?

25
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.920
And we saw last week really how our context today is not that much different

26
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.120
from what it was 2000 years ago in Colossae.

27
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.560
And so this speaks to us just as much as it did to them.

28
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.040
And so go ahead and take your copy of God's word. Turn with me to Colossians.

29
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.120
It's most of the way towards the end.

30
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.360
It's a little bit after a couple long books. Romans one, two Corinthians,

31
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.000
Colossians. Just put a bookmark there. Again,

32
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.520
you've got some ways to do that out in the lobby. Uh,

33
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.560
that would magnets or phone lock screens, whatever.

34
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.200
But put a bookmark there and we'll come back to it over the next few weeks.

35
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.360
Of course, before we get there though,

36
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.320
one of my favorite days of the year is Thanksgiving. Anybody else love?

37
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.080
Thanksgiving is your favorite day. Uh,

38
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.680
I'll always with family and football's on all day.

39
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.320
Of course I always eat way too much pumpkin pie. Well, I should say, uh,

40
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.560
whipped cream with a little bit of pumpkin pie. Let's say it that way. Uh,

41
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.800
it just, it's sweet time together, of course.

42
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.360
But one of the funny moments to me in nearly every Thanksgiving I'm at is the

43
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.480
mixed reaction around the table whenever we are are,

44
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.240
are sitting down and we're just about to get ready to eat.

45
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.600
And then someone says,

46
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.160
let's all go around the table and say what we're thankful for. Right?

47
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.400
You know what I'm talking about, right? I am not throwing stones at that.

48
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.520
It's just fine. Keep doing it. But,

49
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.680
but it's just so funny the reactions you get. Some people are groaning,

50
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.680
some people are chuckling. Uh,

51
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.080
some people get these wide eyes like they don't wanna say anything. Uh,

52
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.880
all of these reactions are different. Some people treat it like a joke, right?

53
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.040
Just say, I'm so thankful for my family and they look around at everybody just,

54
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.360
it's not really serious in that. But,

55
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.360
but think about that moment again. I get it. It's fine.

56
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.280
But is that true gratitude, right? Is that really what Thanksgiving,

57
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.240
not just the day, but Thanksgiving in general. Is that really what that's about?

58
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.900
Is it valid if we have to force it to say thank you for things?

59
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.130
Well, today we're gonna see what true thanksgiving really is all about,

60
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.330
where it comes from, plus what it leads to.

61
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.920
And we're just gonna be a few verses now into the book of Colossians verses

62
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.560
three through eight of chapter one. You'll see it here.

63
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.480
We always thank God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

64
00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.000
When we pray for you, since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,

65
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.880
of the love that you have for all the saints,

66
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.280
because of the hope laid up for you in heaven of this,

67
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.880
you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel,

68
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.720
which has come to you as indeed in the whole world,

69
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.880
that is bearing fruit and increasing as it also does among you,

70
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.360
since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth,

71
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.320
just as you learned it from a paths our beloved fellow servant,

72
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.800
he's a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf and is made known to us.

73
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.660
Your love in the Spirit. God,

74
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.460
help us to see today what you want us to see. Open our eyes, our hearts,

75
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.620
our lives for your change to happen.

76
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.460
That we would not be merely hearers of the word,

77
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.060
but we would be doers of it in your power,

78
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.860
for your glory in Jesus authority we pray. Amen.

79
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.860
So again, this,

80
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.400
this was typical of the Apostle Paul when he would write letters after

81
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.440
introducing himself.

82
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.280
He would include this section of Thanksgiving for his readers.

83
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.000
But it was actually more than just saying, Hey, thanks for being who you are.

84
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.600
And almost every one of his letters recorded here in the New Testament.

85
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.360
This Thanksgiving section gives the theological basis for the rest of the

86
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.920
letter. It's the foundation. It's about what God had done for them.

87
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.160
And that's what then gave him the ability to say what he said later.

88
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.080
And so Paul's Thanksgiving was not just to puff them up like,

89
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.160
like here's how great you are. Here's how awesome you are.

90
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.280
It's actually reminding them again of the glory of Christ and what he had

91
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.480
done for them. It's,

92
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.240
it's a reminder before he gets too far into it that his salvation was

93
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.400
great. And in reality,

94
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.120
that should be the source of our Thanksgiving giving.

95
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.520
God himself should be the source of Thanksgiving.

96
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.480
God is our source.

97
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.320
We're gonna see this a lot more next week whenever we look at starting in verse

98
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.880
nine, what Paul prays for the people, actually his prayer for them.

99
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.920
But notice again in verse three, he writes this. He says,

100
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.360
we always thank God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you.

101
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.160
So he's regularly praying for them and he's thanking God for them,

102
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.920
thanking God for what he's done.

103
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.040
But notice the theological statement Paul's making here.

104
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.040
He's not just praying to some generic God out there.

105
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.480
He's not even just praying to the,

106
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.560
the Jewish God that he had been praying to for his most of his life until

107
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.640
a couple years ago. No,

108
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.600
he's praying to this God known as the Father of the one who used

109
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.200
to see as an imposter, Jesus Christ,

110
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.240
the one that he was persecuting trying to squash out.

111
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.120
Now he sees God Yahweh as the Father of Lord Jesus Christ.

112
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.760
And notice it wasn't just a generic Jesus either the Lord Jesus Christ,

113
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.400
like the fullest term you could use for who Jesus was.

114
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.280
But this was who Paul and the church saw Jesus to be, right?

115
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.400
They saw Jesus as God himself.

116
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.920
'cause remember that was counter to whatever other gods were around them.

117
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.000
In Colossae,

118
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.080
they were hearing all these other things that this could be a God and this could

119
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.880
be a God and there could be a lot of gods. And he says, no, Jesus is God.

120
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:41.360
But that, remember, that was the source of thanksgiving for Paul.

121
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:48.000
That anything good in our lives comes from God Almighty.

122
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.760
It comes from the Lord of heaven and earth. The sovereign one, the good one,

123
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.920
the holy one. What we just sang about, it comes from him.

124
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.920
That's the source of our Thanksgiving.

125
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.840
So everything he's about to say about the Colossians to the Colossians,

126
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.520
everything else in this letter, all about them, all about the gospel,

127
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.920
it's all sourced from God.

128
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.240
That's the foundation of everything. And that's a good reminder for us today,

129
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.760
isn't it? See, we cannot,

130
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.520
especially in a, a very blessed wealthy area,

131
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.040
we cannot divorce God's blessings from the source.

132
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.480
And we tend to love what we have instead of remembering where we get it from.

133
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.480
Everything. Even our breath comes from him.

134
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.200
As James one 17 says,

135
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:46.200
every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of lights.

136
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.120
So you think about that Thanksgiving table,

137
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.280
of course you won't be excited to share what you're thankful for.

138
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.360
If you don't truly see God as the giver of all good things in your life,

139
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.800
if you just assume you have, everything's good, I've got it because I am good,

140
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.560
you're not gonna be grateful. Paul is grateful here.

141
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.840
The source of his thanksgiving is God himself.

142
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.280
But then he continues and he shows the Colossians.

143
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.720
The foundation of thanksgiving then is hope.

144
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.880
Everything good comes from God.

145
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.120
But then the the basis for it is hope.

146
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.760
Look again at verses four and five,

147
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.410
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for

148
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.370
all the saints because of the hope laid up for you in

149
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.130
heaven. Now,

150
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.770
the construction here in the original language is a little backwards to us.

151
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.370
The way Greek was written is different than the way English works.

152
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.690
And so it can get a little confusing to us. It reads a little funny to us.

153
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.370
But notice the first word of verse four is the word sense,

154
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.530
S I N c E. That word ties it back to what he just said,

155
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.410
right? So he says something, he says sense. So there,

156
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.810
there's a connection between those two things that the reason,

157
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.430
so notice this.

158
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.370
The reason he thinks God when he prays for them is because he'd heard about

159
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.410
their faith and their love, that they were full of faith, full of love.

160
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.930
He's like, man, thank you God for that.

161
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:30.450
But further he sees the reason they have that faith in love

162
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.890
in verse five is because of the hope laid up for them in heaven.

163
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.330
See that He's thanking for what he sees,

164
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.170
but then he ties it to the foundation, which is their hope.

165
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.290
That's why he gives thanks. Now this word for hope,

166
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.650
we use that word all the time. Like I hope the cowboys win.

167
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.280
Probably not going to, but like I hope, I hope, I hope there's like this,

168
00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:03.200
this idea of this state or activity of longing that we're we're expectant

169
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.320
for something, right?

170
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.640
But here the word actually refers to the thing hoped for

171
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.950
four. Here it's,

172
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.590
it's this thing laid up for them in heaven,

173
00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.310
that something is stored there for them later.

174
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.070
Like that squirrel in your backyard, you know,

175
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.310
digging holes and putting acorns in there that that's the hope.

176
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.190
Not that he hopes it's still there,

177
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.190
but it's the actual hope itself in the ground.

178
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.310
Something stored up for us is the hope. Yes,

179
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.550
there's expectancy for that of course,

180
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.670
but it's more about the tangible item.

181
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.070
And so when Paul writes this here in Colossians one,

182
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.790
he's talking about this hope laid up for them in heaven is this perfect eternity

183
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.590
in the new creation with Jesus.

184
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.750
Like this is the hope that you have laid up,

185
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.910
stored up for you in heaven is this reality.

186
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.590
You get to be with him forever in perfection.

187
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.430
Not just that you long for it, look forward to it,

188
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.510
but it actually is something to hold onto.

189
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:11.710
I love how one Peter one verses three through five says it,

190
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.590
it ties hope to that future. It says,

191
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.590
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

192
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.430
according to his great mercy,

193
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.350
he's caused us to be born again to a living hope through the

194
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.750
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

195
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.870
Not just that notice to an inheritance that is imperishable,

196
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.110
undefiled, unfading kept in heaven for you.

197
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:40.150
Who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be

198
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:45.310
revealed in the last time. So he's saying, you've been born again.

199
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.470
You have a living hope because Christ is alive. But it's not just about today.

200
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.750
It's about something coming. And the fact that he is alive,

201
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.230
we're gonna sing this song later, and I just, I can't wait living hope, right?

202
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.390
We're gonna sing that song about Jesus who is alive and one day's coming back to

203
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.870
take us home with him. That's the hope.

204
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.310
And if you remember the,

205
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.990
the Colossian church was being squeezed by all these religions around

206
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.350
them, many of which would not even mention an afterlife at all.

207
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.030
It was all about just kind of getting your life right here.

208
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.950
And so the hope for the colossian Christians of something greater to

209
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.550
come would be a powerful witness in their culture.

210
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.870
That's what one Peter says later in chapter three. In your hearts, honor Christ,

211
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.710
the Lord as holy. That means honor him as Christ above all,

212
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.950
always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you

213
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:47.310
for a reason, for the hope that is in you. Right?

214
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.200
So this is a witness. The fact that we can look at the future and say,

215
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.960
you know what? There's a hope coming. There's a certainty of hope coming.

216
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.200
It's faith that I can't see it,

217
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.600
but I still know it's there and there is hope that comes.

218
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.600
That's a massive witness when you face death,

219
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.960
when you face hard times.

220
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.430
But that's not just a witness. That same eternal hope is a powerful motivator

221
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.110
because in Colossians one,

222
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.230
verse five is how the word ties back to the statements in verse four.

223
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.470
I'm gonna read it again since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,

224
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:28.990
of the love you have for all the saints because of the hope laid up for you

225
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.310
in heaven. So our hope in Christ,

226
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:38.230
coming back one day is a powerful motivation for constant faith

227
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.270
and costly love. Even today,

228
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.950
like just think about it. If I have all that I need,

229
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.350
if I know that on the other side of death I have everything forever,

230
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.070
then then I can be steady. Today

231
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.650
I can sacrifice more willingly.

232
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.370
'cause I'm not holding on to this stuff because I got it all already coming.

233
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.690
See how this works, right?

234
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:09.170
There's a hope there that gives me different reactions today.

235
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.890
And those are the things that he talks about that spring from eternal hope.

236
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.170
He's seeing their faith in love. And so he says, your hope is why you do that.

237
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.610
And that's the results of hope.

238
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.050
And so notice what it leads to. Again, I'm gonna dig into those a little bit.

239
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.290
Eternal hope in Christ leads to faith in Christ. First,

240
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.610
this is verse four, right? He's he's saying I,

241
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.450
I can see this in you because of the hope you have.

242
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.650
You have faith in Christ Jesus.

243
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:50.570
Now, I'm sure you've heard about or read about in the news how that word faith

244
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:55.650
is often thrown around so flippantly as meaning any religious belief,

245
00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.250
right? You've heard that people of all faiths.

246
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.570
And in some sense that's true because there's people who believe what they

247
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.330
believe. Of course they do believe those things. But notice in here,

248
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:11.610
Colossians one, Paul makes it very explicit. It's not just faith in anything.

249
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.850
It's faith in Christ Jesus, Faith.

250
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.330
And that word faith means not only which,

251
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.650
which we kind of waver back and forth when we talk about faith,

252
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.330
it's not just mentally agreeing to a set of facts about Jesus.

253
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.130
It's personal trust and commitment to Jesus.

254
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:36.330
But we can't forget that it actually is assenting agreeing to affirming a

255
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:41.090
set of beliefs about who Jesus is. You have to believe who Jesus is.

256
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.050
You have these exclusive claims of truth about Jesus.

257
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.370
We agree with yes, as part of faith.

258
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.480
And think about how countercultural that would've been in in Paul's day in

259
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.600
Colossae with all these mixed religions going that that they're saying any

260
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.600
different way is what you can believe. And that's okay.

261
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.080
Paul's saying that only faith in Jesus is the way to be good with God.

262
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.120
How countercultural that would be,

263
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.250
is that not counter-cultural today just as much, right?

264
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:14.890
Like

265
00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.730
These exclusive claims that only through Christ can you be right

266
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.490
with God, right? No, no. We're told all over the place,

267
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.410
there's many ways to God.

268
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.810
You can believe whatever you want and you'll eventually get there.

269
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.050
We're worshiping the same God as those people over there, right?

270
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.370
And and any exclusive claims of truth, man,

271
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.050
we're stiff arming those really fast. Like we don't like to be told what to do.

272
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.730
But that's the nature of faith.

273
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:50.210
It does involve affirming the set of truths about who Jesus is,

274
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.530
that he is above all else, that he is the only way.

275
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:59.870
And then of course committing to him as a result of that, he's,

276
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.190
he's putting this in front of us, in front of the Colossian Christians saying,

277
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.950
guys, I've heard of your faith.

278
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.870
I've heard of your commitment to him.

279
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.450
But just like back then today, man,

280
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:19.130
our sinful nature kicks against that submission to Jesus as the

281
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:24.130
exclusive way as Jesus commanding our lives. I mean, we, we push back on that,

282
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.770
but, but think about how that can get a little bit easier

283
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.410
if we start with the eternal hope that's laid up for believers,

284
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.170
Right?

285
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.610
When you think about the fact that we've been given everything that I need for,

286
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:47.040
okay, I'm all yours, Jesus, you, you've given me everything. So, okay,

287
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.713
whatever you say,

288
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.920
Romans eight says that in this hope we were saved. Now,

289
00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.200
hope that is seen is not hope for who hopes for what he sees.

290
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.960
But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

291
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.400
I love that phrase. You can't see Jesus,

292
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.080
you can't see eternity with him. You can't see heaven.

293
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.480
We can't see those things, but we know 'cause Jesus resurrected, it's there,

294
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.360
but we wait for it with patience. We wait for it.

295
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.320
Committing to him in faith that he's got this under control,

296
00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.040
that's what hope does, builds our faith.

297
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:35.270
Yet Paul also understood that that kind of hope fueled faith should then produce

298
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.150
something like in verse four,

299
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.230
we learned that their hope led to faith of course,

300
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.190
but their hope didn't just stop with like mentally agreeing with this.

301
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.080
Their hope led to a sacrificial love,

302
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.760
right? You see that here, that that your love,

303
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.480
not only for those that are just like them, not only for their, their buddies,

304
00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:01.600
their hope led to a love that was sacrificial for all the

305
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.160
saints, For everybody who believed.

306
00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.490
In fact, verse eight calls it a spirit filled love.

307
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.730
And if you know the Holy Spirit, you know that,

308
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:18.610
that he's not just a feeling like there's an action, there's an activity.

309
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.770
And if it's a spirit filled love, that means it's going to be active,

310
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.650
it's gonna be sacrificial soul.

311
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.930
And listen, if anything, if anything,

312
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.570
this spirit filled Jesus kind of agape love is what distinguishes

313
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.330
Christians from the rest of the world,

314
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.290
the absolute base level at minimum.

315
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.170
This is what distinguishes should distinguish that we sacrifice

316
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.970
for others good.

317
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:51.170
You think of the story of the Thessalonians in the New Testament,

318
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:56.570
impoverished really had nothing and they gave

319
00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.370
sacrificially money to support the Macedonian church that was in desperate need.

320
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:07.610
Why? Because they love them as their brothers and sisters in Christ.

321
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.770
For all the saints, your love for all the saints,

322
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.410
it's an evidence of their love First John,

323
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.650
the whole book of first John verses or chapters three and four especially

324
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:23.290
says, here's how you know you are alive spiritually. You wanna know,

325
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.530
you wanna know the test. Do you love the brothers?

326
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.890
Do you love the brothers and sisters in the church? Do you love one another?

327
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:34.530
That's the true test because it models how Jesus loved us.

328
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.290
If he loved us like that, we can love one another like that.

329
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.340
But, but how does that relate to? And he says, okay, great.

330
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:45.980
We can love each other.

331
00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.540
But how does that relate to this hope laid up for you in heaven in verse five?

332
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.470
Well, here's, here's how one Peter says it,

333
00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.580
One Peter one 20 through 23 talking about Jesus,

334
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.980
that he was foreknown before the foundation of the world,

335
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.060
but he was made manifest in the last times,

336
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:07.420
visible in the last times for the sake of you.

337
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.460
Who through him are believers in God who raised him.

338
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.820
God raised him from the dead,

339
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:18.020
gave him glory so that your faith and hope are in God.

340
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.300
But this, watch this verse 22,

341
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:26.060
having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere,

342
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.820
brotherly love, love one another,

343
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.060
earnestly from a pure heart since you've been born again,

344
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.540
not a perishable seed but of imperishable through the living abiding word of

345
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:38.570
God.

346
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:43.300
What that means is that if you have been made new

347
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.030
by God, through faith,

348
00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:51.030
by hearing and believing this word of truth, the gospel, he says,

349
00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.990
if that's true of you, you ought to be loving the brothers.

350
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.350
You ought to be loving the church.

351
00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.510
You ought to be loving the brothers and sisters around you.

352
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:04.270
You ought to be loving like Christ because

353
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.590
he's made you different. He's made you new. It's evidence of your faith.

354
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:15.150
So again, you see, eternal hope leads to deeper faith in Christ.

355
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:19.350
It leads to loving others for Christ, Right? This,

356
00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:24.070
this hope that's settled means you can be steady at work when you get

357
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.790
blasted for something or you can be,

358
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.590
you can be steady when you get that cancer diagnosis.

359
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.310
You can be steady when you face difficult times in in your home

360
00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.740
and you can love sacrificially the brothers and sisters around you because of

361
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.900
the hope that's coming that you have everything you need already.

362
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.440
So there's a lot of hope.

363
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.080
But Paul then summarizes that entire word of hope with one word at the end of

364
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:52.913
verse five.

365
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.720
Look at the word he uses at the end of verse five in Colossians one.

366
00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.720
It's the word of hope, the gospel.

367
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.920
Here's how he says, you wanna know what that word of hope is. It's the gospel

368
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.790
that they'd heard the good news. It's the word of hope. It's the word of truth.

369
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.790
And for Paul, it was important, not just because it was good news,

370
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.510
it was because of the truth it contains. That makes it good news.

371
00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.640
See, the gospel to Paul is not merely an invitation.

372
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.200
You tack onto the end of a sermon.

373
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.200
It's not merely a technique for changing people's lives.

374
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.320
It's not what he says about the gospel. He says,

375
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.280
the gospel's actually a power that is let loose in the world because of who it's

376
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:47.030
about. Again,

377
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.710
he's opposing false claims all over colossae.

378
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.870
And instead of that he says, let's go back to the gospel.

379
00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.150
Go back to the gospel,

380
00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:01.070
go back to the truth that's found in one Corinthians chapter 15

381
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:07.110
verses one through four. I would remind you of the gospel I preach to you,

382
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.750
which you received in which you stand, and by which you're being saved.

383
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.830
If you hold fast to the word I preach to you, unless you believed in vain.

384
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:20.390
So this is the gospel that not only saves, it's what we stand in even today.

385
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.470
Verse three, for I delivered to you as a first importance. What I also received,

386
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:25.260
here's the gospel.

387
00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.630
Basically that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures.

388
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:33.670
He was buried and he was raised on the third day in accordance with the

389
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.470
scriptures. That's what he goes back to.

390
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.350
He's, this is the most important message I can ever tell you is this truth,

391
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.200
that Jesus died and was resurrected.

392
00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.800
No other religious system has a God who took on flesh,

393
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.320
lived the perfect life,

394
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.240
died a substitutionary death to pay for our sins,

395
00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.000
and then defeated death to come outta that grave alive.

396
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.600
Like that truth,

397
00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.600
the word of hope is what guarantees the hope stored up.

398
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.520
For those who believe that hope in heaven,

399
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.880
it's guaranteeing that because Christ isn't still dead,

400
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:16.840
he actually is alive.

401
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:24.460
This is why here we always sing the gospel.

402
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.340
We pray the gospel, we preach the gospel.

403
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.740
We call one another to believe the gospel and respond to the gospel like this is

404
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.300
all it is. Why? Because it is true.

405
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.940
It's the word of truth proven in Christ, in his resurrection,

406
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.540
and it is the word of hope that points us to something to come.

407
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:52.240
Paul wrote in Romans one 15 that even Christians need the gospel

408
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.520
regularly. All of us.

409
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:59.960
It's not just the entry point like the the ticket you give to the ticket

410
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.720
taker going into the concert, right?

411
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.160
That it's not just that it is actually what we need. The word of hope,

412
00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.920
that's the constant drumbeat you get here.

413
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.260
The gospel pointing us to Christ above all, because we lead,

414
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.380
we believe that will lead us to hope, that will lead us to faith,

415
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.340
and that will lead us to sacrificial love.

416
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.920
Here's what's beautiful about this passage in Colossians. It doesn't stop there

417
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:37.960
Because then spilling out of Paul's mouth are words regarding the

418
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.200
power of that gospel.

419
00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.160
He almost personifies it. In verse six, he says,

420
00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:50.240
it has come to you like the gospel, got legs and ran to colossal. No, no.

421
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.640
It was through Eris, right?

422
00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.040
We know this local boy who came to Christ and Paul sent him back to preach the

423
00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.240
gospel in his hometown. This beloved servant, faithful minister.

424
00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.480
He loved them. He was loved. This is a apris,

425
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.240
an example really we could all follow.

426
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.040
Whether you leave Edmund or not be a minister of the gospel where you are,

427
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.800
but Paul said the gospels come to you.

428
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:19.000
It's power not just personified. He imagined it then like a plant.

429
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.800
This is so interesting. Look at verse six. He says,

430
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.000
the gospels come to you as indeed in the whole world.

431
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:31.280
It is bearing fruit and increasing as it also does among you

432
00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.480
since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth.

433
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:41.400
So he's now not just a person, it's a plant. Well, we know it's not a plant,

434
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.720
but, but notice what he's doing.

435
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:48.790
He reminds them here that the gospel was at work among them,

436
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:53.710
it was bearing fruit. It was increasing in their own lives.

437
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.390
The gospel was at work. It's just like in Galatians five,

438
00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.510
he talks about the fruit of the spirit showing up,

439
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.830
that God's changing you. Or John 15,

440
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:08.430
Jesus said he appointed all believers to bear fruit like this is

441
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.110
showing something different. Or Mark four,

442
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.670
the parable Jesus gave where the good soil received,

443
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:17.990
the gospel seed produced fruit 30 fold, 60 fold, a hundred fold.

444
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.790
Something happens when the gospel takes root.

445
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:27.800
What this means is that the colossian Christians should take heart in the fact

446
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.120
that the gospel really was working in their lives. Paul's an objective,

447
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.440
outsider, looks at colossae. He says, Hey guys, I can see it

448
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.400
like I can see it.

449
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.200
Riss even was praying for this, that that the church, this is in chapter four,

450
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:48.200
that the church would stand, mature and fully assured in the will of God.

451
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.760
Paul and Riss were praying that the church would grow because of the gospel,

452
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:53.880
Because

453
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.580
Why? Why would they need to hear this? Maybe they couldn't see it themselves.

454
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.690
Maybe. Maybe they were a little bit blinded by these other religious systems.

455
00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:07.970
It was drowning out the fact that God really was at work in their life and they

456
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.450
could not see it. That they needed to hear again.

457
00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.650
That gospel was at work among them.

458
00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.940
Maybe they were confused by all the religious experiences that everybody else

459
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.140
was having around them, and it sure seemed like, man,

460
00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.900
what we're experiencing is not like what they,

461
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.620
they're a little bit crazy over there.

462
00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.540
They're doing some weird stuff over there, man.

463
00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.740
Mine doesn't look like what they seem to look like. You know, Paul says,

464
00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.380
Hey guys, remember what God, what God has done,

465
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.380
and listen, that's the thing about experiences. It can mislead you either way.

466
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.900
An experience can mislead you from the truth, but,

467
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.540
but a lack of experience can also mislead you that you don't have something just

468
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.420
because you're not experiencing what they have. Listen,

469
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.500
the reality is God was making them each more like Jesus,

470
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.620
and sometimes that takes a really long time. In fact,

471
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.180
it takes all of us our whole lives, But,

472
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.540
but you might not be able to see it every day or week,

473
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.420
but you look back a couple years and you say, oh, that that's the way I was.

474
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.820
Now look at the way God made me to be and and even collectively,

475
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.260
he's looking at the church saying, guys, look,

476
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.140
you're way more loving together than you were before. Don't miss it.

477
00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.020
It's not crazy fanciful stuff like they're experiencing,

478
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.020
but notice it's working in you. God is working in you.

479
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:31.870
Listen,

480
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.190
I know you might not feel like it right now. Church.

481
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.680
You don't have the same conversion experience like this guy over over here or

482
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.360
that lady over there. You grew up in the church.

483
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.320
You don't really know a time you didn't know Jesus,

484
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.040
but you know you love him and committed to him.

485
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.040
Your journey to Christ is very different than everybody else's. That's okay.

486
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.540
Has God worked in your life? That's the question.

487
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.780
Like can you attribute change in your life to God doing something

488
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.620
or just 'cause you're in a better situation than you were before that,

489
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.420
that that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about God's work.

490
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.900
I just met with a man this week

491
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.660
who shared how deeply God had broken him and he'd been a believer

492
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.540
in his mind his whole life, but just the last couple years, his pride,

493
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.593
his control,

494
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:24.220
God had crushed him in some big ways and now though

495
00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:26.390
now he lives free.

496
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.950
He's free to live a life that just follows Jesus and is honest and open.

497
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:37.630
How encouraged it was for me, how encouraging it was to hear this truth

498
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.680
and so God is at work in your life.

499
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.080
Can you attribute anything in your life to what God has done? Look for it.

500
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:52.160
Look way back and see what God has done and then submit to his

501
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.360
work continued today 'cause you're not finished.

502
00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.080
But also he was talking to the church in Colossae are,

503
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.080
are we church becoming more gentle,

504
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.180
becoming more servant minded, kinder,

505
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:12.100
more generous as a church where we're giving away?

506
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.300
'cause the gospel's not just gonna work in us individually.

507
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:19.060
The gospel's gonna work in us together as a whole as well.

508
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:26.430
And so the God of salvation was working in their lives.

509
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:31.230
But also notice this growing plant was so powerful that it was going beyond

510
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:35.310
Colossae. It was going to all parts of the earth.

511
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:40.230
He says this hope was spreading beyond just

512
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.870
their church. Why?

513
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:48.950
This missional spread of hope was spreading because it was

514
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.790
empowered. This is the truth.

515
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.030
The spread of hope in your life, in our lives,

516
00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.950
in the world is empowered by God. Because remember,

517
00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.590
it's God who causes the growth of the gospel in us.

518
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.030
It's God who sins and plants it elsewhere.

519
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.070
Now, does he use us? Yes, he does.

520
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:19.310
In light of the hope he's given us like we should work hard to plant and sow and

521
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.870
water the gospel seed, but we cannot forget this is God's work.

522
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.310
Gospel work is God's work.

523
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.950
It is interesting that some people believe this phrase in verse six,

524
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:36.310
that he uses bearing fruit and increasing that phrase is a callback to Genesis

525
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.400
one and two, that narrative where God creates everything.

526
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.720
'cause remember what happened then remember,

527
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.680
it was God's word that was creating and commanding,

528
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.200
and then through Adam, he called to multiply and fill the earth.

529
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:58.680
Check this out here in Colossians one,

530
00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.280
it's the word of truth,

531
00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:06.680
God's word that recreates and commands through

532
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:12.040
the new Adam Jesus to multiply and fill the earth.

533
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.050
Right? You see that like he's still called. That's still what he wants,

534
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:21.850
is that multiplication. Matthew 28, go make disciples of all nations.

535
00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.970
Even in Acts 1224, the same phrase is used.

536
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:30.170
The word of God increased and multiplied like

537
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:34.770
this is a thread. From the very beginning. God was like, I want worshipers.

538
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.570
What I intended in the beginning through Christ now through us,

539
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:45.570
is that God fills the earth with his glory through redeemed humanity.

540
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.970
Adam and Eve were supposed to start that way, fill the earth with worshipers.

541
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.290
It failed. Now, through Christ,

542
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.450
he's filling the earth with worshipers through us on mission,

543
00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.850
a redeemed humanity. Here's what that means.

544
00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:02.050
As you and I hear the word of truth,

545
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:06.930
the gospel we're filled with hope. Leading to faith and love.

546
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:12.770
God's plan from the beginning is more and more fulfilled. That we are,

547
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.570
we are filling the earth as we live sin, we multiply the gospel.

548
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:21.610
We are filling the earth with worshipers that he intended from the beginning,

549
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.970
and here's what happens as a result. Here's the the end game of this,

550
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:32.130
a global eternal kingdom society that

551
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.850
lives, thinks, acts loves like Jesus.

552
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:40.970
That's the new kingdom. One day we'll be fully inaugurated.

553
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:44.450
For now, we are just multiplying, multiplying,

554
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:49.870
multiplying as we live sent, And so if you wonder, that's why we're here.

555
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:55.510
That's why God still left us here. He didn't just poof us when we got saved,

556
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:58.310
right? He, he left us here. Why did he leave us for this?

557
00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:01.670
That's why we gather together to be reminded of these truths so we can go

558
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:02.190
multiply.

559
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.350
That's why we love one another like we do because it's an image of the kingdom

560
00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:08.950
to come. That's why we go and carry that gospel.

561
00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:13.790
That's why all of this happens is because God wants his glory to shine through

562
00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:14.683
his people

563
00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:21.790
and that should be for us, a grateful response

564
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.990
where our lips are full of Thanksgiving.

565
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.030
Why? Because Christ has saved us that,

566
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:37.200
that he is above all holy, righteous,

567
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.840
but he has saved us, so what else would we do

568
00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.160
but give our lives to him? That's why

569
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.240
we preach the gospel. That's why Paul reminds him.

570
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.800
It's because of the gratitude we have for all that he's done for us,

571
00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.640
and praise God for that. Praise God for the hope that we have.
