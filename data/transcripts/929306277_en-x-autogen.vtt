1
00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:01.065
He is risen.

2
00:00:01.795 --> 00:00:04.705
Risen. Okay, good. I love that.

3
00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:06.945
Some of you're clapping and some of you said what, right?

4
00:00:07.085 --> 00:00:10.585
So, uh, he is risen. He is risen. There you go.

5
00:00:10.745 --> 00:00:12.465
I, I'm happy with either one of those, right? Yeah.

6
00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.185
Um, what a great problem to have.

7
00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:17.105
We've got people sitting in the hallway over here.

8
00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:19.385
We got people sitting along the wall, like,

9
00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.705
praise God for that, right?

10
00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:24.625
Like just, uh, thank you for being flexible.

11
00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:27.265
I know this is chaos. It's beautiful chaos,

12
00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:29.905
but it is so, uh, just, we can make it right.

13
00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:31.705
We'll do this, okay? Uh, if you're new

14
00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:32.745
to our church, my name is John.

15
00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:33.825
I'm one of the pastors here.

16
00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:35.705
We're grateful you choose to be here.

17
00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:38.545
Uh, please let us know if you are new and,

18
00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:40.385
and kind of looking to, uh,

19
00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:41.705
take a step forward with the church.

20
00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:43.625
We've got people at the front right of here afterwards,

21
00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:46.025
but specifically the new here area out there would be your

22
00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:49.505
best bet to go introduce yourself, get to know us, and,

23
00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:50.905
and we would get to know you a little bit.

24
00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:52.425
Please let us do that. We'd love to.

25
00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:57.425
Uh, but we are here on the highest peak of all the mountains

26
00:00:57.425 --> 00:00:59.505
of our faith called Resurrection Day.

27
00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:02.305
And so it is a, a gathering that we

28
00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:05.025
don't do anything different than we do every

29
00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:06.265
other Sunday of the year.

30
00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.625
But it just seems like it matters a little bit more,

31
00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:10.345
even though it's not.

32
00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:12.985
But, but really what I'm gonna talk about today is

33
00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:17.425
what Tim call Tim Keller called the hinge upon which the

34
00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:19.465
story of the world pivots.

35
00:01:20.925 --> 00:01:23.905
That's how critical this really is. How important this is.

36
00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:27.105
It's the resurrection of Christ, that he was dead

37
00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:28.505
for three days and now he's alive.

38
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.985
Like that's the simple base level message of it.

39
00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:36.995
Which if that is true, that changes everything.

40
00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:42.275
It makes unbelief implausible.

41
00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:49.445
But if that is false, if it's untrue,

42
00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:51.885
if he didn't really come back from the grave,

43
00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:53.445
that changes everything as well, doesn't it?

44
00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:58.235
It makes belief implausible.

45
00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:03.435
That's how critical Easter really is.

46
00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:06.675
Everything rises or falls on whether he stayed dead

47
00:02:07.575 --> 00:02:09.835
or whether he came outta that grave alive.

48
00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:12.645
Now, many people don't believe

49
00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:15.645
that he did come back to life.

50
00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:19.805
Some would say that it's scientifically impossible

51
00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:23.285
for someone to die three days later to come back to life.

52
00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:27.965
It just can't happen. Some of you might be in that frame

53
00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:30.485
of mind right now, and you just got

54
00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:31.565
drug here 'cause your family came.

55
00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:33.405
That's it's real happens.

56
00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:38.645
But there are some of us who, who would believe that?

57
00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:41.805
Who would say, yeah, of course Jesus resurrected, we believe

58
00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:45.805
that, but, but you don't really understand the meaning

59
00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:46.925
of why it matters

60
00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:51.135
or how it affects our lives to

61
00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:57.335
and forever hope to clear up some of those things today

62
00:02:57.435 --> 00:02:58.855
as we go into God's word,

63
00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:01.405
which is one Corinthians 15 for us today.

64
00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:04.085
So take your copy, God's word, turn there with me,

65
00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:05.405
one Corinthians 15.

66
00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:08.725
It's in the New Testament. Later in the Bible you'll find a,

67
00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:10.085
a longer book, one Corinthians.

68
00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:12.965
If you don't have a Bible, uh, you can find one

69
00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:14.965
underneath the seat around you or in front of you.

70
00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:17.605
Uh, if you don't own a Bible at all,

71
00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:19.285
please take that home as our gift to you.

72
00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:20.765
We'd love to let you take that

73
00:03:20.765 --> 00:03:22.565
and read who God is through that.

74
00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:26.805
We're gonna begin a new series next week, by the way,

75
00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:29.085
in First Corinthians, so just kind of continuing on

76
00:03:29.765 --> 00:03:31.125
a little bit in that book,

77
00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:35.155
but just as a bit of background as we go into this today,

78
00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:37.795
the, the apostle Paul was writing this letter to

79
00:03:38.335 --> 00:03:39.715
the church in Corinth

80
00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:41.435
and they'd asked him a series of questions.

81
00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:45.075
They were looking for answers from a leader in the church.

82
00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:47.195
And so they were saying, Hey, what, what do we do with this?

83
00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:49.595
How do we handle this? How do we respond here?

84
00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:52.155
And part of those questions dealt with resurrection.

85
00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:56.645
And so Paul here in one Corinthians 15,

86
00:03:57.825 --> 00:04:02.525
he spent 11 verses explaining the basic gospel message,

87
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.645
the good news that Jesus died.

88
00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:08.365
He was buried. And he raised again, like that's the essence,

89
00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:09.485
the core, the basic.

90
00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:12.725
But he also said to them

91
00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:15.845
that this was not just a made up story, like a group

92
00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:16.845
of 12 guys got together

93
00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:18.245
and came up with this awesome way

94
00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:20.445
to change the world or change their lives.

95
00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:22.165
And so it wasn't just a made up story

96
00:04:22.165 --> 00:04:25.805
because actually about 500 people saw Jesus alive

97
00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:28.365
after he was obviously dead and buried.

98
00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:31.235
So he is saying, you guys can believe this,

99
00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:33.595
this is the gospel, the good news.

100
00:04:35.335 --> 00:04:39.495
But there were some people in Corinth who denied

101
00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:41.175
that resurrection is even possible.

102
00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:46.485
There's no way that just does not happen.

103
00:04:47.815 --> 00:04:50.275
Or, or maybe they might have believed that the soul

104
00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:54.195
lasts forever, but the body just kind of fades away.

105
00:04:54.705 --> 00:04:57.975
It's not important. And so

106
00:04:57.975 --> 00:05:01.095
that's why Paul then goes into this to explain

107
00:05:01.095 --> 00:05:04.415
to them the consequences of denying resurrection.

108
00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.895
Okay guys, so you believe resurrection's impossible.

109
00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:11.535
So, so let me explain to you the implications of that.

110
00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:15.535
Let me argue why you shouldn't,

111
00:05:15.595 --> 00:05:16.775
but also tell me,

112
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.615
tell you why it gets down the road as it does.

113
00:05:19.635 --> 00:05:22.135
And so we're gonna see it here, the consequences

114
00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.775
of denying resurrection just in general at all.

115
00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:27.845
And we'll see it here. First Corinthians chapter

116
00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:29.485
15, starting in verse 12.

117
00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:32.595
I'll read a few verses then we'll

118
00:05:32.595 --> 00:05:33.755
talk about it a little bit.

119
00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:39.035
Now, if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead,

120
00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.795
how can some of you say that there is no resurrection

121
00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:45.475
of the dead, but if there is no resurrection of the dead,

122
00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:47.435
then not even Christ has been raised.

123
00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:50.355
And if Christ has not been raised,

124
00:05:50.355 --> 00:05:53.715
then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.

125
00:05:55.015 --> 00:05:57.725
We are even found to be misrepresenting God

126
00:05:57.995 --> 00:05:59.685
because we testified about God

127
00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:02.365
that he raised Christ whom he did not raise.

128
00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:05.675
If it's true that the dead are not raised for,

129
00:06:05.675 --> 00:06:07.955
if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised,

130
00:06:08.455 --> 00:06:10.955
and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile

131
00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:12.715
and you are still in your sins,

132
00:06:14.395 --> 00:06:16.365
then those also who've fallen asleep

133
00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:19.365
or died in Christ have perished.

134
00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:25.805
If in Christ we have hope in this life only we are

135
00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:29.325
of all people most to be pitied.

136
00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:32.605
So notice how Paul went about this.

137
00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:35.365
He gets the question about resurrection and,

138
00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:37.485
and he goes about it in a really logical,

139
00:06:37.885 --> 00:06:39.005
reasoned kind of way.

140
00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:41.405
So you, you see if then statements,

141
00:06:41.405 --> 00:06:44.765
you see him repeat himself, you see him follow logic to say,

142
00:06:44.765 --> 00:06:46.285
well, if you believe this, here's next.

143
00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:48.085
You believe that? Well here's next.

144
00:06:48.085 --> 00:06:51.725
Here's the logical implications of denying

145
00:06:52.555 --> 00:06:54.365
that resurrection's even possible.

146
00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:57.725
And notice what he says first he says

147
00:06:57.725 --> 00:07:01.365
that if someone believes that, then what you're saying is

148
00:07:01.365 --> 00:07:04.515
that our testimony is a lie, right?

149
00:07:04.515 --> 00:07:06.915
So he's an apostle, he's proclaiming the gospel

150
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.475
to the world, he's taking it out to the nations.

151
00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:12.435
And he says, if you're saying denying resurrection is

152
00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:13.515
where you believe, then,

153
00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:15.035
then you're telling us that we're lying.

154
00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:18.625
'cause remember, he's talking to people

155
00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:22.505
who he assumed were believers, they're in the church.

156
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:23.585
And so he's saying, you, you,

157
00:07:23.585 --> 00:07:24.825
you guys believe this stuff, right?

158
00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:26.905
But if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead,

159
00:07:27.305 --> 00:07:30.745
a basic tenet of our faith, how can you even say

160
00:07:30.745 --> 00:07:32.545
that there's no resurrection at all?

161
00:07:33.965 --> 00:07:36.745
That's the foundational part of our beliefs.

162
00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:39.665
It doesn't make any sense for you to deny, resurrection

163
00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:40.825
and still be a Christian.

164
00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:46.375
Plus it again, accuses the apostles of lying.

165
00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:48.895
That's what verse 15 says.

166
00:07:48.895 --> 00:07:51.615
They'd be found to be misrepresenting God.

167
00:07:51.925 --> 00:07:54.575
They said he did, but he didn't.

168
00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:58.265
If they believe that, okay, so how does that apply?

169
00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:00.025
Well, what's the logic for us then?

170
00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:06.625
Well, if we deny that resurrection can happen at all,

171
00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:10.235
then, then that's to turn around

172
00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:12.395
and also say that anyone who preaches

173
00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:13.835
that message is a liar.

174
00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.375
By the way, it's also to say

175
00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:20.355
that the New Testament is lying to us.

176
00:08:22.075 --> 00:08:26.375
And it's also to say that Jesus himself was a liar

177
00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:30.165
because he said, I'm coming back after the third day

178
00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:34.845
because if resurrection is

179
00:08:35.255 --> 00:08:37.525
impossible, then our message

180
00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:40.365
that Christ has been raised is actually untrue.

181
00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:42.845
We've made up a story.

182
00:08:42.895 --> 00:08:45.645
We're lying to get people on our side even though it's a

183
00:08:45.645 --> 00:08:47.965
foundational element of our faith as Christians.

184
00:08:48.475 --> 00:08:52.125
It's not true if we deny resurrection.

185
00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:57.505
But, but here's, here's maybe the, the worst part of this

186
00:08:58.845 --> 00:09:02.625
that would also mean then that Christ is still dead.

187
00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:06.265
Like if we deny resurrection,

188
00:09:07.705 --> 00:09:09.155
that means Christ is still dead.

189
00:09:13.245 --> 00:09:15.225
That's what you see in verses 13 and 16.

190
00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:16.665
He repeats himself almost exactly.

191
00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.425
He says, if the dead are not raised,

192
00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:20.905
then not even Christ has been raised.

193
00:09:20.965 --> 00:09:22.705
And that's a massive problem, right?

194
00:09:26.285 --> 00:09:30.065
See, if Jesus had died never to be raised again,

195
00:09:31.015 --> 00:09:34.225
then what that means is that it proves

196
00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:38.465
that death could take the loveliest and best life ever

197
00:09:39.925 --> 00:09:41.025
and finally break it.

198
00:09:43.325 --> 00:09:44.755
Death would win.

199
00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:48.275
That there's, there's something that, that,

200
00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:50.275
that means there's no hope because there's something

201
00:09:50.755 --> 00:09:52.435
stronger than God.

202
00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:55.195
That means the tomb is still sealed

203
00:09:56.335 --> 00:09:58.395
and Christ is still dead.

204
00:09:58.415 --> 00:09:59.435
That's still back there.

205
00:09:59.495 --> 00:10:02.915
He, his bones are still in that tomb.

206
00:10:08.535 --> 00:10:10.795
It also means then though along with that,

207
00:10:10.815 --> 00:10:13.875
if you deny resurrection verses 14, 17,

208
00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:16.675
and 18, say then that our faith is futile.

209
00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:23.355
If you deny resurrection our faith, if Christ is still dead,

210
00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:24.875
our faith is useless,

211
00:10:28.945 --> 00:10:31.485
our preaching is empty, our belief is in vain.

212
00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:36.695
And and he says it here, you are still in your sins.

213
00:10:39.165 --> 00:10:41.225
Now, how does that work? Well follow this one.

214
00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:43.265
Peter two says

215
00:10:43.265 --> 00:10:47.065
that Christ bore our sins in his body on the

216
00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:48.345
tree, on the cross.

217
00:10:49.525 --> 00:10:50.625
So there, there is a measure

218
00:10:50.645 --> 00:10:53.265
of when he was dying on the cross

219
00:10:54.005 --> 00:10:55.985
in shedding his atoning blood.

220
00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:59.305
It pays for covers our sin,

221
00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:03.535
but the victory over those

222
00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:06.695
sins actually occurs when he walked out

223
00:11:06.695 --> 00:11:10.175
of the grave alive, right?

224
00:11:10.195 --> 00:11:12.015
So, so you see there's parts here.

225
00:11:12.675 --> 00:11:14.775
He, he did part of it here, part of it here.

226
00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:16.335
And all of that matters together.

227
00:11:16.515 --> 00:11:18.055
But, but, so lemme try to illustrate this

228
00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:19.135
for you a little bit.

229
00:11:19.135 --> 00:11:21.135
It's not perfect, but it's at least something we can

230
00:11:21.135 --> 00:11:22.175
kind of grasp here.

231
00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:26.215
Imagine you and I are wrapped up in our sins.

232
00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:30.055
We're we are enslaved by our sin.

233
00:11:30.055 --> 00:11:32.575
Where, where we can't get out, there's nothing we can do

234
00:11:32.635 --> 00:11:34.455
to get out of those sins.

235
00:11:34.455 --> 00:11:35.855
But when Christ died,

236
00:11:37.165 --> 00:11:40.095
when I put my faith in his work in my place,

237
00:11:41.685 --> 00:11:44.935
then the scripture says I effectively died with him.

238
00:11:45.995 --> 00:11:47.135
And what that means is

239
00:11:47.135 --> 00:11:51.895
because of his blood, it means that those chains are broken.

240
00:11:52.485 --> 00:11:55.365
That I have been set free from sin.

241
00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:59.365
Now those chains have been broken,

242
00:11:59.415 --> 00:12:01.445
their power has been cut off.

243
00:12:03.955 --> 00:12:06.095
But those chains can still be heavy, can't they?

244
00:12:07.775 --> 00:12:10.475
So again, just imagine you're wrapped up with chains and,

245
00:12:10.815 --> 00:12:14.275
and, and you're sitting there before and you can't get out.

246
00:12:14.435 --> 00:12:18.115
There's no way out. But when Christ died, it broke the power

247
00:12:18.215 --> 00:12:19.435
of those chains.

248
00:12:19.455 --> 00:12:20.675
It broke them open.

249
00:12:20.855 --> 00:12:23.395
So you're released now, but,

250
00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:25.915
but we can still sit there wrapped up, can't we?

251
00:12:27.685 --> 00:12:31.495
We can still stay kept down.

252
00:12:33.265 --> 00:12:36.965
We could remain in that place where the power's been broken,

253
00:12:37.105 --> 00:12:39.165
but we stay in that stage.

254
00:12:42.305 --> 00:12:45.245
But since they've been broken, remember if they're not

255
00:12:45.845 --> 00:12:49.165
powerful anymore, you can literally walk right out of them.

256
00:12:49.265 --> 00:12:53.825
Now that's, if, that's exactly what Romans six says.

257
00:12:55.765 --> 00:12:58.665
It says, just as Christ was raised from the dead

258
00:12:58.725 --> 00:13:03.465
by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness

259
00:13:03.485 --> 00:13:07.025
of life that the chains have been broken

260
00:13:07.485 --> 00:13:11.665
and we have the power in Christ new to walk out of him.

261
00:13:13.605 --> 00:13:16.305
That's the idea of the resurrection, illustrating

262
00:13:16.305 --> 00:13:18.705
that not only are the power of the chains

263
00:13:18.705 --> 00:13:21.025
and sin broken, you now have the ability

264
00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:24.665
to walk in a new life, out of the tomb, out of the chains

265
00:13:25.015 --> 00:13:26.785
that you couldn't before.

266
00:13:27.575 --> 00:13:30.025
Were set free from sin by his death,

267
00:13:30.085 --> 00:13:31.705
but were given new life.

268
00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:34.625
By his resurrection, he defeated death.

269
00:13:34.685 --> 00:13:36.985
So we don't have to lay in it anymore.

270
00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:42.755
That's why without resurrection, our faith is fruitless.

271
00:13:45.895 --> 00:13:47.925
Death still wins in the end.

272
00:13:49.435 --> 00:13:51.215
We don't have hope of eternal life.

273
00:13:51.275 --> 00:13:53.495
We are still in our sins.

274
00:13:53.555 --> 00:13:57.575
We don't have the ability to walk towards life eternal

275
00:13:59.045 --> 00:14:00.565
'cause we're still there.

276
00:14:00.585 --> 00:14:03.005
And and listen, he, he was writing to people

277
00:14:03.025 --> 00:14:04.045
who were worried about this.

278
00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:07.565
If you die, so imagine Christ hasn't been resurrected.

279
00:14:07.565 --> 00:14:10.445
If you die, he says you perish eternal.

280
00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:14.205
That perish word is a, an eternal judgment kind of word.

281
00:14:16.065 --> 00:14:18.045
You're still in your sins and you perish.

282
00:14:18.045 --> 00:14:20.045
And so you, you're thinking about that person.

283
00:14:20.135 --> 00:14:22.165
These people are thinking about the brothers

284
00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:24.965
and sisters that died in Christ.

285
00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:26.605
They were believers. What happens to them?

286
00:14:28.685 --> 00:14:29.425
It says, if Christ

287
00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:30.745
hasn't been raised, they're, they're done.

288
00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:35.125
You perish. Same for us.

289
00:14:35.225 --> 00:14:39.205
That's why the fourth consequence

290
00:14:39.205 --> 00:14:41.485
of denying resurrection is

291
00:14:41.485 --> 00:14:45.735
that our life is pitiable as a result.

292
00:14:47.415 --> 00:14:48.545
Like if we stand here

293
00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:50.225
and deny resurrection,

294
00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.805
If we're basing our eternal hope on a lie,

295
00:14:57.875 --> 00:15:00.725
then we deserve pity.

296
00:15:03.795 --> 00:15:06.135
All this that we're doing here today is a massive waste

297
00:15:06.135 --> 00:15:09.435
of time right there.

298
00:15:09.435 --> 00:15:11.195
There are a whole lot of other things we could be doing

299
00:15:11.195 --> 00:15:13.075
that would be more fun than sitting here listening

300
00:15:13.075 --> 00:15:17.885
to a guy talk for 30 minutes in.

301
00:15:17.945 --> 00:15:22.005
In fact, not only are we wasting our time, but

302
00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:26.885
but just think about how we, we choose to do things

303
00:15:26.945 --> 00:15:29.165
and not do things because we're Christians,

304
00:15:29.165 --> 00:15:31.125
because we talk about this, we believe the Bible,

305
00:15:31.335 --> 00:15:32.805
we're doing these things and we're saying

306
00:15:32.805 --> 00:15:33.845
where I'm not gonna do this.

307
00:15:33.905 --> 00:15:36.285
I'm gonna do this and, and we make our lives harder.

308
00:15:36.545 --> 00:15:38.125
If Christ has not been raised,

309
00:15:38.335 --> 00:15:40.085
we're doing all that for no reason.

310
00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:44.975
We're making our lives harder for no reason.

311
00:15:47.795 --> 00:15:49.375
We might as well just go live it up.

312
00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:52.615
We might as well just go have a good time

313
00:15:52.615 --> 00:15:54.175
because in the end there's no consequence.

314
00:15:55.235 --> 00:15:59.745
We might as well just go use everyone

315
00:15:59.805 --> 00:16:00.865
and use everything

316
00:16:00.965 --> 00:16:03.905
to give ourselves the highest pleasure we can find in this

317
00:16:03.905 --> 00:16:06.945
moment right here and now there's no consequence,

318
00:16:06.975 --> 00:16:08.505
there's nothing after this anyway.

319
00:16:08.645 --> 00:16:10.585
So we might as well just go enjoy ourselves.

320
00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:16.395
Isn't that the prevailing thought of our culture though?

321
00:16:18.935 --> 00:16:22.485
Isn't that the way that almost animal-like in our instincts

322
00:16:22.485 --> 00:16:24.285
that we just say right here

323
00:16:24.285 --> 00:16:25.285
and now, this is all that matters.

324
00:16:25.465 --> 00:16:26.645
I'm gonna get the highest level

325
00:16:26.645 --> 00:16:28.125
of pleasure I can out of this.

326
00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:35.065
But when you think about it, if there is no resurrection,

327
00:16:35.255 --> 00:16:36.945
that makes total sense, doesn't it?

328
00:16:38.435 --> 00:16:39.765
This is all there is here

329
00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:42.445
and now I might as well get as most out of it as I can.

330
00:16:46.065 --> 00:16:47.525
But what do you get in the end?

331
00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:53.915
You don't get endless hope. What you get is a hopeless end.

332
00:16:57.375 --> 00:17:00.875
That's why we kind of spend our lives trying to avoid death,

333
00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:03.275
trying to not talk about it, trying to push it off as far

334
00:17:03.275 --> 00:17:05.835
as, because this, this is all there is.

335
00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:08.595
Gotta make the most of it. Gotta live it out.

336
00:17:13.035 --> 00:17:16.805
Well, thankfully, on this resurrection day,

337
00:17:16.805 --> 00:17:18.485
that's not the end of the passage, right?

338
00:17:19.065 --> 00:17:21.205
That's pretty hopeless, pretty miserable at this point.

339
00:17:22.705 --> 00:17:24.535
We're just here trusting in a delusion.

340
00:17:27.685 --> 00:17:31.675
Verse 20 of one Corinthians 15, verse 20 corrects us.

341
00:17:35.115 --> 00:17:38.725
But look for those words throughout scripture.

342
00:17:38.775 --> 00:17:41.525
Those are key words. They're transitions.

343
00:17:41.525 --> 00:17:43.725
They say, Hey, on the contrary,

344
00:17:45.385 --> 00:17:46.805
but in fact,

345
00:17:47.105 --> 00:17:50.885
Christ has been raised from the dead, right?

346
00:17:51.105 --> 00:17:53.365
So, so he's saying over

347
00:17:53.425 --> 00:17:57.435
and over again, he's saying, here's what happens.

348
00:17:57.435 --> 00:17:59.555
If you don't believe this, if you don't believe it all,

349
00:17:59.735 --> 00:18:00.355
if you don't believe

350
00:18:00.515 --> 00:18:02.035
resurrection's possible, here's what you get.

351
00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:05.995
But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead

352
00:18:06.515 --> 00:18:07.915
'cause remember, the foundation

353
00:18:07.935 --> 00:18:10.635
and fabric of our faith falls apart.

354
00:18:11.055 --> 00:18:12.155
If he hasn't been raised.

355
00:18:13.645 --> 00:18:15.215
There's no reason for us to be here.

356
00:18:15.215 --> 00:18:17.815
There's absolutely no reason for us to do what we are doing.

357
00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:19.895
But praise God that he has,

358
00:18:20.195 --> 00:18:23.615
and the word that he has been raised, it's a continual word.

359
00:18:23.805 --> 00:18:25.975
It's a word that means he didn't just raise one time

360
00:18:26.035 --> 00:18:27.415
and then probably died later.

361
00:18:27.675 --> 00:18:32.415
He raised continually staying as the risen Lord permanently.

362
00:18:33.475 --> 00:18:36.575
That's this idea of he has raised, that's

363
00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:37.575
what I wanna shift now to.

364
00:18:37.675 --> 00:18:40.735
We talked about the consequences of denying resurrection.

365
00:18:40.925 --> 00:18:44.135
What about the consequences of Christ's resurrection?

366
00:18:45.365 --> 00:18:47.135
What are the implications of that?

367
00:18:47.355 --> 00:18:49.055
We know what happens when we deny it.

368
00:18:49.245 --> 00:18:52.095
What happens now because of it?

369
00:18:54.145 --> 00:18:56.875
Look at verses 20 through 26,

370
00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:01.045
by the way, again, he says, fallen asleep, that means died.

371
00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:02.765
It's a great illustration of

372
00:19:02.765 --> 00:19:03.965
what we're gonna talk about here in a second.

373
00:19:03.965 --> 00:19:05.005
Just keep that in mind.

374
00:19:06.185 --> 00:19:08.445
But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead.

375
00:19:08.585 --> 00:19:13.285
The first fruits of those who have fallen asleep for as

376
00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:17.765
by a man came death by a man has come also the resurrection

377
00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:20.765
of the dead for as in Adam all die.

378
00:19:21.185 --> 00:19:23.685
So also in Christ shall all be made alive.

379
00:19:24.945 --> 00:19:28.765
But each in his own order, Christ the first fruits,

380
00:19:29.195 --> 00:19:31.685
then at his coming, those who belong to Christ

381
00:19:33.155 --> 00:19:34.325
then comes the end.

382
00:19:34.835 --> 00:19:37.205
When he delivers the kingdom to God, the Father,

383
00:19:37.215 --> 00:19:39.285
after destroying every rule and every authority

384
00:19:39.285 --> 00:19:42.565
and every power for he must reign

385
00:19:42.575 --> 00:19:45.045
until he's put all his enemies under his feet,

386
00:19:46.065 --> 00:19:49.445
the last enemy to be destroyed is death.

387
00:19:52.885 --> 00:19:57.705
So what happens? Because Christ arose?

388
00:19:59.555 --> 00:20:02.325
Well, first what we learn is that that means

389
00:20:03.245 --> 00:20:07.745
resurrection's coming for believers too, right?

390
00:20:08.015 --> 00:20:10.145
What are the implications of Christ's resurrection?

391
00:20:10.855 --> 00:20:13.985
Believers get resurrection as well.

392
00:20:14.015 --> 00:20:15.665
This is all the first fruit stuff

393
00:20:15.665 --> 00:20:17.145
that Paul wrote about here.

394
00:20:17.145 --> 00:20:18.585
You might not understand that. That's fine.

395
00:20:18.615 --> 00:20:20.905
It's, it's explained here in a little bit when

396
00:20:20.905 --> 00:20:21.945
you think about it.

397
00:20:22.095 --> 00:20:25.305
Paul was probably picturing the Passover feast.

398
00:20:26.285 --> 00:20:28.145
You might remember that from the Old Testament

399
00:20:28.145 --> 00:20:29.225
history of the Exodus.

400
00:20:29.255 --> 00:20:32.665
When God's people get released from slavery out of Egypt,

401
00:20:32.725 --> 00:20:35.145
it began the Passover festival.

402
00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:37.595
And so they would celebrate that,

403
00:20:37.615 --> 00:20:40.315
but at the same time, it was also a great harvest festival.

404
00:20:41.805 --> 00:20:43.545
It was at the same kind of time

405
00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:45.945
of year when those things would coincide.

406
00:20:45.965 --> 00:20:49.005
And so when you go back to the Old Testament, Leviticus 23,

407
00:20:49.005 --> 00:20:51.605
where I know you stopped in your reading plan this year,

408
00:20:51.785 --> 00:20:52.925
you gave it up at that point.

409
00:20:53.225 --> 00:20:56.585
But Leviticus 23 is where

410
00:20:57.245 --> 00:21:01.065
God commands his people to bring the first fruits,

411
00:21:01.065 --> 00:21:05.825
the the first best batch of the harvest to the tabernacle

412
00:21:05.885 --> 00:21:07.585
to say offer it to God.

413
00:21:09.505 --> 00:21:12.605
And that was an illustration then of

414
00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:13.805
what they would then go back

415
00:21:13.865 --> 00:21:15.765
and receive the rest of the harvest.

416
00:21:17.065 --> 00:21:19.035
They couldn't touch it, they couldn't use it,

417
00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:20.595
they couldn't sell it.

418
00:21:20.595 --> 00:21:22.155
They couldn't do any of that with the rest of it

419
00:21:22.165 --> 00:21:23.755
until they offered the first fruits.

420
00:21:25.815 --> 00:21:29.275
But, but in a sense, this first fruit offering was a sign

421
00:21:30.015 --> 00:21:31.235
of the harvest to come.

422
00:21:34.965 --> 00:21:37.465
Is that not what we see here with the resurrection of Jesus?

423
00:21:40.605 --> 00:21:43.225
It was a sign of the resurrection

424
00:21:43.245 --> 00:21:44.785
of believers that's coming later.

425
00:21:45.885 --> 00:21:49.985
The first fruits for those

426
00:21:50.085 --> 00:21:51.265
who belong to Christ.

427
00:21:51.325 --> 00:21:54.105
Notice it says this is the first fruits,

428
00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:56.745
this is the first example of what's going to happen later.

429
00:21:56.895 --> 00:21:58.385
He's first then his people.

430
00:22:01.085 --> 00:22:04.165
I wanna clarify something about this resurrection.

431
00:22:05.105 --> 00:22:07.805
See, what we talk about and think about often is, is that

432
00:22:08.005 --> 00:22:10.085
whenever we're resurrected, there's gonna be some kind

433
00:22:10.085 --> 00:22:12.965
of like we're we're floating around on clouds with harps

434
00:22:13.105 --> 00:22:15.365
and somehow we're gonna be this disembodied.

435
00:22:15.395 --> 00:22:17.125
Somehow we get wings outta this thing.

436
00:22:17.145 --> 00:22:19.445
I'm not sure how that works, but we're, we're floating

437
00:22:19.445 --> 00:22:23.645
through and, and it's just this weird eternal sort of moment

438
00:22:26.725 --> 00:22:29.945
or that we're gonna be reincarnated into something based on

439
00:22:29.945 --> 00:22:32.785
our works here and it's based on levels then

440
00:22:33.965 --> 00:22:35.465
that's not at all what this is.

441
00:22:36.565 --> 00:22:38.655
When we talk about the resurrection that you

442
00:22:38.715 --> 00:22:39.975
as a believer will receive.

443
00:22:41.115 --> 00:22:44.015
It is actually you resurrected

444
00:22:45.875 --> 00:22:49.425
where you get a new fully human body

445
00:22:51.015 --> 00:22:52.345
just like Jesus's was.

446
00:22:53.575 --> 00:22:55.385
Because remember when he was resurrected,

447
00:22:55.405 --> 00:22:57.025
you see people coming up to him

448
00:22:57.025 --> 00:22:58.185
and they're like, are you real?

449
00:22:58.295 --> 00:23:00.265
Like they think he's a ghost in some ways.

450
00:23:00.325 --> 00:23:02.185
And, and what they could do is they could put their

451
00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:03.465
fingers in the wounds.

452
00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:04.905
They could in his side, they could touch

453
00:23:04.905 --> 00:23:06.105
him, they could hug him.

454
00:23:06.125 --> 00:23:10.545
He was eating food. He was a figure, a human body,

455
00:23:12.415 --> 00:23:13.595
you know, it was very different,

456
00:23:14.415 --> 00:23:18.235
but it was still a human body that was remade.

457
00:23:19.805 --> 00:23:22.975
It's what you and I believers will receive as well.

458
00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:26.375
Not only will receive a new body will also be brought into

459
00:23:27.015 --> 00:23:30.335
a world that is incomparably more

460
00:23:30.335 --> 00:23:31.695
desirable than this one is.

461
00:23:33.005 --> 00:23:35.455
Like, man, we try to make this as great as we can.

462
00:23:35.475 --> 00:23:36.775
We try to look for everything we can.

463
00:23:36.805 --> 00:23:38.975
This is nice and it's great to get in creation

464
00:23:38.975 --> 00:23:42.775
and worship God, but we can't even see a glimmer in this

465
00:23:42.835 --> 00:23:43.975
of what it's gonna be someday.

466
00:23:45.265 --> 00:23:49.525
That's the resurrection that Christ was the first fruits of

467
00:23:49.525 --> 00:23:51.845
that we as believers will receive as well.

468
00:23:54.535 --> 00:23:57.955
But I, but I know like how, how's it even possible?

469
00:23:58.805 --> 00:24:01.755
How's that possible for us to receive that blessed benefit?

470
00:24:01.995 --> 00:24:04.875
I mean, Christ did it. Okay, I get it. He's God.

471
00:24:04.895 --> 00:24:06.675
But how do we get that?

472
00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:10.955
It's through what Paul wrote here about Adam

473
00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:13.875
and our connection to Adam.

474
00:24:13.935 --> 00:24:15.995
Now this is Adam from the Adam and Eve.

475
00:24:15.995 --> 00:24:17.875
Genesis 1, 2, 3 story, right?

476
00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:22.365
First human in a way,

477
00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:25.565
our representative head you might say,

478
00:24:26.875 --> 00:24:31.325
because at the time the Jews believed that when Adam sinned,

479
00:24:31.985 --> 00:24:35.925
all of us, the whole human race effectively sinned with him

480
00:24:36.535 --> 00:24:37.805
since we were from him.

481
00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:41.835
And so we're all then guilty.

482
00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:43.755
That's how sin and death entered our

483
00:24:43.755 --> 00:24:44.995
lives, entered the world.

484
00:24:45.065 --> 00:24:47.115
It's through Adam and we are all caught up in it.

485
00:24:48.295 --> 00:24:49.635
And some people think, well, that's not fair.

486
00:24:49.745 --> 00:24:51.235
Okay, well you sin too, don't you?

487
00:24:51.355 --> 00:24:53.675
I sin like I'm just as guilty.

488
00:24:54.725 --> 00:24:56.035
We're all stuck in this

489
00:24:56.055 --> 00:25:01.005
and we're all then as sinners deserving of death.

490
00:25:04.365 --> 00:25:07.745
But with the coming of Christ, that cycle was broken.

491
00:25:08.105 --> 00:25:10.225
'cause remember, he was not of the seed of Adam.

492
00:25:12.315 --> 00:25:13.335
The cycle was broken.

493
00:25:13.475 --> 00:25:16.135
And so Jesus sinless and he conquered death.

494
00:25:16.445 --> 00:25:20.495
What that means is that when we, we connect, unify with him,

495
00:25:21.235 --> 00:25:25.255
the the, the ability we have to receive

496
00:25:25.255 --> 00:25:28.815
what he offers is now a new power that overcomes

497
00:25:28.815 --> 00:25:30.375
what we once were connected to.

498
00:25:30.745 --> 00:25:33.095
We're still connected, Adam, we're still physically dying.

499
00:25:33.275 --> 00:25:36.935
Yes, but the new power in Christ, this

500
00:25:37.445 --> 00:25:42.175
sinless Christ breaks the power so that we're not tied

501
00:25:42.195 --> 00:25:43.855
to the death of Adam anymore.

502
00:25:45.405 --> 00:25:46.625
The spiritual death of Adam.

503
00:25:46.725 --> 00:25:50.425
We have a new hope, a new power in Christ.

504
00:25:52.685 --> 00:25:55.705
In fact, that's the illustration he gives here in verse 23.

505
00:25:55.725 --> 00:25:56.745
He uses the word order.

506
00:25:56.885 --> 00:25:59.805
You see that, but each in his own order,

507
00:25:59.805 --> 00:26:02.005
that order word is a military term

508
00:26:04.575 --> 00:26:07.105
that in a sense, there, there's like two waves.

509
00:26:08.325 --> 00:26:11.185
Uh, you think of a military, especially the old times

510
00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:14.505
of military where they'd go in waves of troops battle line

511
00:26:14.605 --> 00:26:16.065
and they'd just go in waves, right?

512
00:26:16.725 --> 00:26:19.665
In a sense, there's two waves in this battle.

513
00:26:19.835 --> 00:26:23.185
First captain Jesus, he's leading the charge

514
00:26:23.485 --> 00:26:25.185
and he's going out on his own.

515
00:26:25.525 --> 00:26:28.305
And we are, he's, we're following him as his troops.

516
00:26:28.805 --> 00:26:30.825
The believers are right behind him.

517
00:26:32.095 --> 00:26:33.145
He's charged ahead

518
00:26:34.045 --> 00:26:36.625
and we're following along in the same direction right

519
00:26:36.625 --> 00:26:38.985
behind him as he goes into this battle.

520
00:26:41.565 --> 00:26:43.480
You think about it like the pictures you get

521
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.560
and the images you get of those battles, how fearful

522
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.725
that would be where you're walk, walking in line,

523
00:26:47.965 --> 00:26:49.365
marching towards the battle line

524
00:26:49.365 --> 00:26:52.005
and you're about to meet how fearful you would be.

525
00:26:52.105 --> 00:26:54.045
Are we gonna overcome this? Are we gonna win?

526
00:26:55.815 --> 00:26:57.225
Well, this battle is different.

527
00:26:59.225 --> 00:27:02.325
We can run behind our captain

528
00:27:03.165 --> 00:27:06.205
victoriously knowing that we are going to be

529
00:27:06.385 --> 00:27:08.685
and confident we're going to be victorious

530
00:27:08.685 --> 00:27:12.405
because just ahead of us, what we've watched is our victor.

531
00:27:12.875 --> 00:27:13.965
He's already pierced

532
00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:15.925
through the battle line on the other side,

533
00:27:16.105 --> 00:27:17.445
and we're coming right behind him

534
00:27:18.465 --> 00:27:19.325
and we don't have to worry

535
00:27:19.325 --> 00:27:20.445
about whether we're gonna win or not.

536
00:27:20.445 --> 00:27:22.725
We've already seen, he's won the battle for us

537
00:27:23.745 --> 00:27:27.885
and we walk right behind him, that enemy line of death

538
00:27:27.945 --> 00:27:30.605
and sin has been broken in him.

539
00:27:32.135 --> 00:27:33.355
We receive the benefit.

540
00:27:33.815 --> 00:27:35.675
And that's good news on its own, right?

541
00:27:36.735 --> 00:27:38.715
But that's not even it. There's more here.

542
00:27:39.335 --> 00:27:43.685
But because then he says in verse 24, then comes the end.

543
00:27:44.955 --> 00:27:47.535
So we've watched him pierce through the enemy line already,

544
00:27:47.595 --> 00:27:51.495
but then comes the end where at some future climax,

545
00:27:51.515 --> 00:27:54.455
Christ will fully destroy even death.

546
00:27:55.825 --> 00:27:58.635
He's already defeated it, but some days come

547
00:27:58.635 --> 00:28:01.395
and he's gonna fully destroy it and put it away.

548
00:28:01.535 --> 00:28:06.375
How great is that? And listen, I know how good news

549
00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:09.985
that is because I know what it feels like

550
00:28:10.005 --> 00:28:11.425
to lose a hero, grandpa.

551
00:28:15.865 --> 00:28:20.035
And I know what it feels like to, to wrestle

552
00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:22.075
with an uncertain medical diagnosis.

553
00:28:22.095 --> 00:28:24.955
And you, you don't, you don't know what the next days hold

554
00:28:25.215 --> 00:28:30.155
and, and you don't know when you're struggling

555
00:28:30.255 --> 00:28:32.875
day by day through this emotional concern

556
00:28:32.895 --> 00:28:33.955
or this family struggle

557
00:28:33.975 --> 00:28:36.795
and you're just thinking there is no end to this ever.

558
00:28:42.245 --> 00:28:43.735
This is good news

559
00:28:44.685 --> 00:28:49.375
because what it means is that life is certain in Christ.

560
00:28:52.415 --> 00:28:55.155
Yes, life eternal, the resurrection.

561
00:28:55.155 --> 00:28:57.875
We're gonna live forever. But I'm talking about something

562
00:28:57.875 --> 00:28:59.875
more than just that physical life forever.

563
00:29:02.185 --> 00:29:05.645
I'm talking about true new life.

564
00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:09.245
That's what this is referring to,

565
00:29:11.475 --> 00:29:14.645
that life is certain in Christ.

566
00:29:14.905 --> 00:29:17.005
And what that means is that there's coming a day

567
00:29:18.665 --> 00:29:22.155
when this resurrected Christ will destroy every power

568
00:29:22.345 --> 00:29:25.315
that has come against him, where he will,

569
00:29:26.575 --> 00:29:28.995
he will crush the enemy under his feet.

570
00:29:28.995 --> 00:29:30.355
Right now, he's already got

571
00:29:30.355 --> 00:29:32.075
that like the old WWF stuff, right?

572
00:29:32.075 --> 00:29:34.475
They're hanging on the rope. He's got his enemy under his

573
00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:35.635
foot, on his neck, right?

574
00:29:35.635 --> 00:29:37.315
Just yanking on. He's already got that.

575
00:29:37.545 --> 00:29:39.555
He's already in authority over the enemy.

576
00:29:39.735 --> 00:29:42.565
But there's a day coming, they'll be completely gone.

577
00:29:44.485 --> 00:29:49.115
Even death that

578
00:29:49.115 --> 00:29:51.315
that's the enemy you and I can do nothing about, right?

579
00:29:53.765 --> 00:29:55.035
Every other enemy in our lives,

580
00:29:55.055 --> 00:29:56.275
we can do something about it.

581
00:29:58.025 --> 00:29:59.645
We can get bigger guns, bigger bombs.

582
00:30:00.825 --> 00:30:04.415
We, we can, we can go through the better defense systems

583
00:30:04.415 --> 00:30:07.175
around our house or around our social structure

584
00:30:07.395 --> 00:30:10.455
or we, we can attack medically

585
00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.495
or systematically or scientifically.

586
00:30:12.495 --> 00:30:14.575
We can do all kinds of stuff against the enemies we face

587
00:30:14.805 --> 00:30:15.815
here and now.

588
00:30:18.435 --> 00:30:22.375
But there is no pill. There's no cream.

589
00:30:22.565 --> 00:30:26.495
There's no thing that can keep death at bay.

590
00:30:29.105 --> 00:30:31.755
It's coming for us. Every one of us.

591
00:30:33.595 --> 00:30:35.775
We cannot keep it away.

592
00:30:37.495 --> 00:30:40.275
And listen, there's even a time 2000 years ago when God,

593
00:30:40.275 --> 00:30:41.515
the son took on a human nature

594
00:30:41.575 --> 00:30:45.115
and he was on that cross, that old rugged cross.

595
00:30:46.005 --> 00:30:47.835
There was a moment in history where

596
00:30:48.605 --> 00:30:50.515
death thought it had won.

597
00:30:55.655 --> 00:30:56.715
But three days later,

598
00:31:00.685 --> 00:31:04.745
but three days later, death

599
00:31:05.325 --> 00:31:08.305
was swallowed up in victory, right?

600
00:31:11.935 --> 00:31:15.305
Because death is a strong enemy. Absolutely.

601
00:31:15.565 --> 00:31:18.065
But believers do not have to fear death

602
00:31:18.215 --> 00:31:19.825
because resurrection wins.

603
00:31:21.565 --> 00:31:23.705
We don't have to look death in the face,

604
00:31:23.705 --> 00:31:24.785
whether it's our own death

605
00:31:24.785 --> 00:31:26.905
and we're just like, no, no, no, I don't want to stay away

606
00:31:27.005 --> 00:31:28.465
or, or it's the death of a loved one

607
00:31:28.465 --> 00:31:30.145
or it's sickness or trials.

608
00:31:30.245 --> 00:31:32.305
We don't have to look at that with fear

609
00:31:32.305 --> 00:31:36.985
because we know God wins and he will reign fully

610
00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:38.145
and finally forever.

611
00:31:38.325 --> 00:31:41.065
And so for the believer, there's no fear in death anymore

612
00:31:43.615 --> 00:31:47.985
because two Timothy one 10 says, Christ has destroyed death

613
00:31:48.405 --> 00:31:49.465
and has brought life

614
00:31:49.605 --> 00:31:51.945
and immortality to light through the gospel.

615
00:31:53.925 --> 00:31:55.785
So friends, this is the meaning of Easter.

616
00:31:57.405 --> 00:32:01.905
The Son of God came on a mission to defeat sin,

617
00:32:02.365 --> 00:32:05.585
to vanquish death and to liberate mankind.

618
00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:08.145
Do you believe this?

619
00:32:13.995 --> 00:32:15.385
Jesus says in John 11,

620
00:32:17.065 --> 00:32:19.025
I am the resurrection and the life.

621
00:32:20.175 --> 00:32:24.865
Whoever believes in me, though he die yet shall he live.

622
00:32:26.165 --> 00:32:29.065
And everyone who lives and believes in me shall never

623
00:32:29.285 --> 00:32:31.465
die. Do you believe

624
00:32:31.465 --> 00:32:32.465
This?

625
00:32:36.085 --> 00:32:39.925
So maybe you think that resurrection's impossible,

626
00:32:43.385 --> 00:32:45.365
or maybe you think that resurrection is only

627
00:32:45.365 --> 00:32:47.205
for those people who aren't as bad as you are.

628
00:32:50.665 --> 00:32:53.445
Or maybe you're just not even sure how the benefits Christ

629
00:32:53.995 --> 00:32:55.645
purchased apply to you.

630
00:33:00.185 --> 00:33:02.925
How about we instead reorient our beliefs around

631
00:33:02.925 --> 00:33:07.885
what God's word has said, which leads us,

632
00:33:07.905 --> 00:33:11.805
and I hope you've seen this today, it leads us to the hope

633
00:33:12.145 --> 00:33:14.605
of Christ's resurrection for us.

634
00:33:19.115 --> 00:33:22.565
Something That gives us not just hope forever and ever

635
00:33:22.585 --> 00:33:24.005
and like, well, yeah, we'll get that someday,

636
00:33:24.465 --> 00:33:26.405
but a living hope

637
00:33:26.695 --> 00:33:31.695
today that changes everything.

638
00:33:33.905 --> 00:33:35.005
Do you believe this.
