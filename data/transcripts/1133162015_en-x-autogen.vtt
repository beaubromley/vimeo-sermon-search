00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:05.085
Well church, this is another beautiful

2
00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:07.045
picture of the gospel.

3
00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:09.965
This is Gabe Jeter

4
00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:15.765
and over the last couple months working with one

5
00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:20.245
of our members and then having a family specifically be

6
00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:22.885
praying for him over the last couple months, he's come

7
00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:25.205
to realize just a few weeks ago, came forward

8
00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:27.885
after his service, talked to one of our prayer partners and,

9
00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:30.245
and shared, I just, I need Jesus.

10
00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:36.005
And so this today is evidence of that.

11
00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:37.605
It's not the only evidence,

12
00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:40.885
but it is a part of what it means to follow Jesus,

13
00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:44.965
to declare that publicly through baptism as a symbol,

14
00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.045
another symbol of death to life

15
00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:50.245
of what's happened spiritually.

16
00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:53.925
And so Gabe, I get to baptize you, my friend.

17
00:00:54.235 --> 00:00:58.005
What a gift it is on today, like today to hear

18
00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.645
and to see this happen.

19
00:01:00.065 --> 00:01:02.965
And so because of your profession of faith in Jesus,

20
00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:05.325
I baptized you in the name of the Father, son

21
00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:06.125
and Holy Spirit,

22
00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:19.625
Listen, church, maybe,

23
00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.985
maybe somebody is in the same place

24
00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:23.305
Gabe was a few weeks ago.

25
00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:26.225
We got prayer partners down here at the front.

26
00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.145
As soon as we're done, men and women who'll be willing

27
00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:30.945
and love the privilege to talk with you

28
00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:34.145
and pray with you about that, about anything.

29
00:01:34.755 --> 00:01:36.425
Maybe God's working on your heart with that guilt

30
00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:37.705
and you need to find somewhere

31
00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:39.825
that you can get some help walking outta that.

32
00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:40.865
We'd love to help you with that.

33
00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:44.425
So I pray for Gabe and pray for us as we leave today.

34
00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:47.705
Lord, thank you so much for what you've done in Gabe's life

35
00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:51.865
and how you have worked to bring him through

36
00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:54.505
so many circumstances to a place to see you

37
00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:55.945
and see his need for you,

38
00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:00.345
and to be able to live now in a freedom that comes with

39
00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:04.305
your blood, washing him clean spiritually.

40
00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:07.745
I pray for each of us that we would walk in

41
00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:10.705
that freedom today knowing that there is

42
00:02:10.885 --> 00:02:12.865
so much the enemy can accuse us of.

43
00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:15.785
But Jesus, you knew it all too, and you took it to the cross

44
00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:17.065
and then to the grave,

45
00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:18.825
and you came outta that grave alive

46
00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:21.185
with victory over all of it.

47
00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:24.825
So may we walk in that freedom today.

48
00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:28.985
May we lean on each other towards the freedom

49
00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:32.345
that you offer us knowing this is a hard battle,

50
00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:35.345
but you're at work in us having already won that battle

51
00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:40.625
to bring us home one day fully and completely purified.

52
00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:44.505
Grateful God bless us. Send us for your glory.

53
00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:48.825
In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Amen. Love you church.

54
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.085
We are sent.

55
00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:52.505
Amen.
