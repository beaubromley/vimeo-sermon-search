WEBVTT

1
00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:20.765
Well, what a morning already church.

2
00:00:20.765 --> 00:00:23.765
Really what a last couple weeks it's been.

3
00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:25.165
Uh, it's just amazing

4
00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:28.325
to watch lives transformed from places all over the world.

5
00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.125
And, uh, we get a chance to participate in that.

6
00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:33.645
I mean, one of our church's values is life giving hope,

7
00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:37.445
where we are, uh, reflecting the gospel

8
00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:39.205
of Jesus with delight.

9
00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:42.805
Uh, as we build relationships infused with grace

10
00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.205
and joy, uh, we're seeing that happen.

11
00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:47.725
Like, uh, it's a palpable sense of excitement

12
00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:49.405
that is really sweet to be a part of.

13
00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:51.245
So, super grateful to be here.

14
00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:53.525
Uh, let's turn now to God's word, back

15
00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:57.805
to our he Shall Reign series in one Samuel,

16
00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:01.085
one Samuel Chapter 25 is where we're gonna be today.

17
00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:07.805
Now, last week we saw the future King David.

18
00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:11.325
He was continuing his growth process.

19
00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:16.525
He's learning how to trust God for justice on his behalf.

20
00:01:17.385 --> 00:01:20.325
Uh, the current king Saul was chasing him down, trying

21
00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:21.445
to hunt his life.

22
00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:26.565
And, and so David had to entrust Saul even to God,

23
00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:28.285
and that was a growth process.

24
00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:31.965
Well, today we're gonna see continued growth in David.

25
00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:36.325
He actually, here we'll face a different kind

26
00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:38.685
of unexpected opportunity.

27
00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:42.325
We'll see how David grows in trust through that.

28
00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:45.565
But it's also gonna lead us to some things.

29
00:01:45.595 --> 00:01:47.445
It's gonna lead us to examine how we face

30
00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:51.005
unexpected temptations in our own lives even today.

31
00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:53.445
So I wanna start by just reading the

32
00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:54.525
first part of verse one.

33
00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:59.005
It almost offhandedly mentions a really important part

34
00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:00.485
of the narrative here.

35
00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:03.125
So look at just first, first part of verse one.

36
00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:06.885
Now, Samuel died like, that's it.

37
00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:09.205
I just, this great man

38
00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:10.885
that the whole thing's named after, right?

39
00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:13.285
Just Samuel died and all Israel assembled

40
00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:15.245
and mourned for him and they buried him in his

41
00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:16.685
house at Rama.

42
00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:18.525
If you remember Samuel, of course,

43
00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:19.765
yes, it's named after him.

44
00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:22.445
But he was God's prophet during this season.

45
00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:24.685
And he was the one who anointed both Saul

46
00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:26.725
and David as the future kings.

47
00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:29.885
Saul first and then David, when Saul lost it,

48
00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:33.245
that was even God's vessel for Saul was to bring

49
00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:35.245
that judgment on him to say,

50
00:02:35.265 --> 00:02:36.685
you don't get to be the king anymore.

51
00:02:37.065 --> 00:02:38.605
Uh, here's how this is gonna work out.

52
00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:41.645
And so Samuel is a really important piece

53
00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:43.245
of the puzzle through the process.

54
00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:48.165
But what happened when he died was that it removed a measure

55
00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:49.605
of protection for David

56
00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:53.565
because David could have said if anybody questioned his

57
00:02:53.795 --> 00:02:55.565
credentials, he could have, Hey, go ask Samuel.

58
00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:59.845
I mean, Samuel anointed me, so he's now Samuel's gone.

59
00:03:01.345 --> 00:03:02.765
And so how would Saul

60
00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.605
and even others respond to David?

61
00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:08.525
Now that Samuel's dead,

62
00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:12.485
it's gonna show up a lot in later chapters, especially, but,

63
00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:15.285
but here we'll see just hints of it, how important it is.

64
00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:19.605
And so look at the rest of verse one down through verse 13.

65
00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:22.045
This is the rest of the scene involving David.

66
00:03:24.585 --> 00:03:27.315
Then David Rose and went down to the wilderness of Piran.

67
00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:30.275
And there was a man in Mayon whose business was in Carmel.

68
00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:34.635
The man was very rich. He had 3000 sheep, a thousand goats.

69
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.755
He was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

70
00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:39.395
Now the name of the man was Neal, the name

71
00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:40.515
of his wife Abigail.

72
00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:42.915
The woman was discerning and beautiful,

73
00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:45.555
but the man was harsh and badly behaved.

74
00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:48.675
It was Caite. David heard in the wilderness

75
00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:49.915
that Neal was shearing his sheep.

76
00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:51.235
And so David sent 10 young men

77
00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:53.395
and David said to young men, go to Carmel.

78
00:03:53.535 --> 00:03:57.235
Go to Neal. Greet him in my name. Thus you shall greet him.

79
00:03:57.235 --> 00:03:59.595
Peace be to you, Nial. Peace be to your house.

80
00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.115
Peace be to all that you have.

81
00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:03.795
I hear that you have shearers now

82
00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:05.075
your shepherds have been with us.

83
00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:07.355
We did them no harm. They miss nothing

84
00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:08.715
all the time they're in Carmel.

85
00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:10.515
Ask your young men, they'll tell you,

86
00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:13.555
therefore, let my young men find favor in your eyes.

87
00:04:13.615 --> 00:04:15.235
We come on a feast day.

88
00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:17.355
Please give whatever you have at hand

89
00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:18.715
to your servants and to your son.

90
00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:22.315
David. When David's young men came, they said all this

91
00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:23.395
to the ball in the name of David.

92
00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:25.755
And then they waited and Nal

93
00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:29.035
answered David's servants, who's David?

94
00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:34.095
Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days

95
00:04:34.095 --> 00:04:35.455
who are breaking away from their masters.

96
00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:37.415
Shall I take my bread and my water

97
00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:39.415
and my meat that I've killed from my shearers

98
00:04:39.415 --> 00:04:41.415
and give it to men who come from I don't know where.

99
00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:44.735
And so David's young men turned away, came back,

100
00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:46.135
told David all this,

101
00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:49.575
and David said to his men, every man strapped on his sword,

102
00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:52.135
every man of them strapped on his sword.

103
00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:55.735
David also strapped on his sword and about 400 men went up

104
00:04:55.735 --> 00:04:58.855
after David while 200 remained with the baggage.

105
00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:03.335
Now we'll come back to that last bit in a second,

106
00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:06.655
but lemme just give you why I structured this sermon the

107
00:05:06.655 --> 00:05:07.935
way I did today.

108
00:05:08.235 --> 00:05:11.175
Really, we're gonna follow the character development

109
00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:13.175
of each person involved here.

110
00:05:13.675 --> 00:05:16.375
So what the text does, it kind of develops them over time.

111
00:05:16.395 --> 00:05:18.175
We see Nal and David already here.

112
00:05:18.175 --> 00:05:21.215
We'll see others as the narrative leads us to those.

113
00:05:21.835 --> 00:05:23.095
But we're gonna just take it

114
00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:25.215
by persons as we go through this.

115
00:05:25.635 --> 00:05:26.655
And you'll see what I mean here.

116
00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:29.415
The first character, of course, we come to is nal.

117
00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:31.855
Now, the character development it gives us is

118
00:05:31.855 --> 00:05:34.655
that his folly, his foolishness led him

119
00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:36.055
to be blind in spirit.

120
00:05:37.715 --> 00:05:41.535
His foolishness led him to be blind in his spirit.

121
00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:45.925
Now, if you didn't catch it while we're reading through

122
00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:48.325
that, the first thing we learned about this man

123
00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:51.405
was not his name, but that he was very rich.

124
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.125
Like he had a booming sheep business.

125
00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:55.685
Everything was going well for him.

126
00:05:57.825 --> 00:06:01.165
The problem comes when his name is actually introduced

127
00:06:01.915 --> 00:06:04.605
because his name nal, in the original language,

128
00:06:05.405 --> 00:06:06.725
actually means fool.

129
00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:12.035
Now you wouldn't name your kid fool, right?

130
00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:15.435
Like, like you introduced to my son conman, right?

131
00:06:15.435 --> 00:06:18.715
Like, you wouldn't do that. This, this is my daughter joker.

132
00:06:18.775 --> 00:06:20.475
No, you wouldn't do those kinds of things.

133
00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:23.515
But in the, in the Old Testament, they seemed to name

134
00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:25.195
and we don't know why, but it's,

135
00:06:25.195 --> 00:06:27.875
it's almost prophetic when you look at a person's name.

136
00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:30.075
We don't know why the parents would've thought they did

137
00:06:30.225 --> 00:06:33.275
what they did, but Neal's name

138
00:06:34.345 --> 00:06:36.435
sets the tone for this whole chapter.

139
00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:40.645
Now, just as a minor point,

140
00:06:40.865 --> 00:06:43.485
it doesn't really have a whole lot to do with this chapter,

141
00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:47.085
but, but the, the enemy of David so far has been Saul.

142
00:06:47.355 --> 00:06:48.885
Saul never appears in this chapter.

143
00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:52.285
He'll show up in 26 again.

144
00:06:52.285 --> 00:06:54.285
He was in 24, but he is not here in 25.

145
00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:59.245
So what we learn here is that in a sense you could see Nial

146
00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:03.365
as like a stand in for Saul, kind of the foil

147
00:07:03.365 --> 00:07:06.525
that David is interacting with almost as a trial run,

148
00:07:06.645 --> 00:07:09.365
a practice run in how to deal with Saul.

149
00:07:09.505 --> 00:07:11.965
He did it right in 24. He'll do it again in 26.

150
00:07:12.025 --> 00:07:14.485
But, but here it's like there's a practice session.

151
00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:18.735
The Lord gives him not a one-to-one correlation,

152
00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:21.495
but you can see what, why, what I mean when we get to it.

153
00:07:21.815 --> 00:07:23.535
'cause watch again what happened here in chapter 25,

154
00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:26.415
David's men had been good to Neal's men.

155
00:07:26.605 --> 00:07:28.695
Like they protected him. They provided for him.

156
00:07:28.765 --> 00:07:30.535
They had not taken anything from them.

157
00:07:30.715 --> 00:07:32.255
And so David's good to Neal.

158
00:07:32.395 --> 00:07:35.295
He assumed Nial was gonna be good to him back. Right?

159
00:07:36.895 --> 00:07:40.315
Yet, what did he get? Look at verses 10 and 11 again.

160
00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:45.095
Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse?

161
00:07:46.355 --> 00:07:48.585
There are many servants breaking away from their masters.

162
00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.025
Shall I take my bread and water

163
00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:51.625
and meat and give it to these guys?

164
00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:52.665
I don't even know where they're come from.

165
00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:54.305
Like should I do that?

166
00:07:56.745 --> 00:07:59.755
Like David got dismissed, he got shunned.

167
00:07:59.975 --> 00:08:04.355
He almost even got accused of rebelling against his master.

168
00:08:08.415 --> 00:08:12.115
So clearly Nabal was foolish in his

169
00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:16.395
interpretation of Israel's political situation.

170
00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:20.145
He didn't understand how this thing was working out.

171
00:08:21.745 --> 00:08:23.545
Possibly, we don't know this for sure, but possibly

172
00:08:23.745 --> 00:08:27.665
'cause Saul might have even been enabling prosperity

173
00:08:27.765 --> 00:08:30.785
for Neal somehow, Which

174
00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:32.425
that happens a lot politically, right?

175
00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:34.545
You give me a favor, I'll give you a favor

176
00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:36.305
and that could have been happening here.

177
00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:37.985
But all we know is

178
00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:40.985
that Nal was foolish according to his name.

179
00:08:41.165 --> 00:08:43.785
And even his actions, he was self-sufficient.

180
00:08:43.925 --> 00:08:47.185
He was prideful and that made him blind spiritual.

181
00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:49.665
He couldn't discern what God was doing through David.

182
00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:52.985
He couldn't see it that maybe God had something other than

183
00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:54.345
store than Saul

184
00:08:55.225 --> 00:08:57.365
and he couldn't even see that God was the one who had

185
00:08:57.605 --> 00:08:59.725
provided all that Neal had to begin with.

186
00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:02.725
It wasn't 'cause he was a master businessman.

187
00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:04.245
It was 'cause God had given him all that

188
00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.205
and he just never saw it.

189
00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:10.525
But here's what Neal's response did.

190
00:09:12.105 --> 00:09:15.205
It provided a massive temptation for David.

191
00:09:18.065 --> 00:09:21.095
David has grown a lot

192
00:09:21.635 --> 00:09:24.575
in the chapters we've walked to until this point,

193
00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:27.175
but here we continue

194
00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:29.975
to see it even maybe an exponential way.

195
00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:31.415
We see his growth in obedience.

196
00:09:32.565 --> 00:09:34.575
David's continuing to grow all the way

197
00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:36.255
through God's shaping him into the man he

198
00:09:36.255 --> 00:09:37.375
needs him to be, to be the king.

199
00:09:37.715 --> 00:09:40.535
But here we see it in full color,

200
00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:44.495
his growth in obedience to God.

201
00:09:47.315 --> 00:09:48.935
And I love how honest the Bible is

202
00:09:49.885 --> 00:09:52.215
because did you see how David responded initially

203
00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:55.335
to Nepal's refusal?

204
00:09:57.515 --> 00:09:59.405
Everybody get up. Get your sword. Let's go.

205
00:10:00.785 --> 00:10:02.685
And we know what he's intending, right?

206
00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:06.445
In fact, later it records it.

207
00:10:06.445 --> 00:10:10.805
Verses 21 and 22, show his intentions says,

208
00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:12.805
surely in vain, David says, surely in vain

209
00:10:12.805 --> 00:10:15.445
of I guarded all this fellow has in the wilderness so

210
00:10:15.445 --> 00:10:16.965
that nothing's missed and all that belonged to him,

211
00:10:17.035 --> 00:10:20.685
he's returned to me evil for good God do so to the enemies

212
00:10:20.685 --> 00:10:23.965
of David and more Also, if by morning I leave so much

213
00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:26.405
as one male of all who belonged to Nal,

214
00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:30.085
that was David's intention.

215
00:10:30.715 --> 00:10:33.645
Meaning he was, he was going with these 400 men

216
00:10:33.905 --> 00:10:37.005
to go kill every male in the ball's clan.

217
00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:42.425
Dozens of them probably. That was in David's heart.

218
00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:49.335
But did you catch what just happened here?

219
00:10:51.695 --> 00:10:53.995
It was another unexpected opportunity for David.

220
00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:58.105
Remember last week, he's hiding in the cave.

221
00:10:58.655 --> 00:11:02.225
Saul, his enemy who's trying to kill him comes in the cave

222
00:11:03.165 --> 00:11:04.665
and David has the opportunity

223
00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:08.465
to slay his enemy, but he doesn't.

224
00:11:12.395 --> 00:11:16.295
Nal presents David with another unexpected opportunity.

225
00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:20.045
How's he gonna respond?

226
00:11:21.545 --> 00:11:24.055
Would he pass the test like he did last time?

227
00:11:26.415 --> 00:11:28.385
Well, initially it sure seemed like he wouldn't

228
00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:30.425
because he is on a mission.

229
00:11:30.735 --> 00:11:33.385
He's heated. He's going to kill all of these men.

230
00:11:36.085 --> 00:11:37.155
Watch what happens next.

231
00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:41.745
Starting in verse 14, we see another character not

232
00:11:41.745 --> 00:11:43.265
introduced, but developed

233
00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:45.265
because we saw her already in verse three,

234
00:11:45.785 --> 00:11:47.945
a woman who's discerning and beautiful.

235
00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:52.325
It says, watch starting in verse 14, what happens here?

236
00:11:54.415 --> 00:11:57.475
But one of the young men told Abigail the ball's wife

237
00:11:57.655 --> 00:12:00.235
to behold, David sent messengers outta the wilderness

238
00:12:00.235 --> 00:12:02.235
to greet our master and he railed at them.

239
00:12:03.775 --> 00:12:05.595
Yet David's men were very good to us

240
00:12:05.695 --> 00:12:06.955
and we suffered no harm.

241
00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:08.675
We didn't miss anything when we were in the fields.

242
00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:11.115
As long as we went with them, they were a wall

243
00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:12.715
to us both day and night.

244
00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:15.155
All the while we are with them keeping the sheep.

245
00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:18.945
Now therefore, know this and consider what you should do

246
00:12:19.365 --> 00:12:22.305
for harm is determined against our master nal

247
00:12:22.305 --> 00:12:23.465
and against all his house.

248
00:12:24.215 --> 00:12:26.265
He's such a worthless man that no one can speak to him.

249
00:12:28.515 --> 00:12:32.525
When, uh, Abigail then made haste, made 200 loaves

250
00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:34.005
and two skins of wine, 500

251
00:12:34.185 --> 00:12:36.925
or five sheep already prepared five seas of parched grain,

252
00:12:37.285 --> 00:12:40.445
a hundred clusters of raisins, 200 cakes of figs,

253
00:12:40.475 --> 00:12:41.525
laid 'em on donkeys.

254
00:12:41.525 --> 00:12:43.685
And she said to her, young men, go before me.

255
00:12:43.685 --> 00:12:44.845
Behold, I'll come after you.

256
00:12:45.025 --> 00:12:46.605
But she did not tell her husband to ball

257
00:12:47.545 --> 00:12:48.965
as she wrote on the donkey came

258
00:12:48.965 --> 00:12:50.005
down under the cover of the mountain.

259
00:12:50.025 --> 00:12:52.485
Behold David and his men came down toward

260
00:12:52.485 --> 00:12:53.925
her and she met them.

261
00:12:56.225 --> 00:12:57.285
Now, this is beginning

262
00:12:57.305 --> 00:12:59.005
to develop this character named

263
00:12:59.235 --> 00:13:02.525
Abigail Neal's wife, right?

264
00:13:03.815 --> 00:13:06.755
And right away we start to see what verse three said,

265
00:13:06.755 --> 00:13:07.875
discerning and beautiful.

266
00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.475
We start to see this discernment

267
00:13:09.475 --> 00:13:10.675
show up right away, don't we?

268
00:13:12.565 --> 00:13:16.345
In fact, her wisdom throughout this passage,

269
00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:20.025
her wisdom will show up as grace in action

270
00:13:20.485 --> 00:13:22.145
to all kinds of people involved here.

271
00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:25.985
Abigail's wisdom and discernment will show up as grace

272
00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:29.825
in action to nal to David to others

273
00:13:30.425 --> 00:13:31.505
involved in this as well.

274
00:13:34.475 --> 00:13:37.075
'cause did you see her act here? What, what did she do?

275
00:13:37.255 --> 00:13:41.155
She on her own had the idea to try to pacify

276
00:13:41.665 --> 00:13:46.095
David's anger like she knew Nal was a

277
00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:47.135
fool like everybody else did.

278
00:13:47.435 --> 00:13:50.095
She knew I I need to spare his life somehow.

279
00:13:50.245 --> 00:13:51.935
This is a way to do it. Here's my idea.

280
00:13:52.115 --> 00:13:54.015
And she goes about it in a wise way.

281
00:13:54.075 --> 00:13:56.935
She knew she had to avert some imminent crisis.

282
00:13:57.395 --> 00:13:58.615
And so how did she do it?

283
00:13:58.725 --> 00:14:00.375
Just like anybody else would do it.

284
00:14:00.515 --> 00:14:01.935
She sent a charcuterie board,

285
00:14:05.505 --> 00:14:06.505
Right? Do you see that?

286
00:14:06.505 --> 00:14:08.695
You read through this thing, you're like,

287
00:14:08.695 --> 00:14:10.855
what I, I had one of those at Thanksgiving, like

288
00:14:10.855 --> 00:14:14.415
that was just, oh, is food, meat, bread,

289
00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:15.895
snacks, all kinds of stuff.

290
00:14:15.915 --> 00:14:18.895
She sent it ahead to say to David, who's got a hungry army

291
00:14:18.995 --> 00:14:20.135
by the way, she's like here.

292
00:14:23.085 --> 00:14:27.705
It was a peace offering. You might say, did it work though?

293
00:14:29.715 --> 00:14:32.285
Like was her spiritual discernment enough

294
00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:36.245
to avert the crisis that was coming for Neal?

295
00:14:37.965 --> 00:14:39.365
Starting in verse 23, watch this.

296
00:14:41.735 --> 00:14:44.065
When Abigail saw David, she hurried

297
00:14:44.065 --> 00:14:45.545
and got down from the donkey and fell

298
00:14:45.545 --> 00:14:47.625
before David on her face and bowed to the ground.

299
00:14:48.525 --> 00:14:49.785
She fell at his feet

300
00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:53.485
and said on me alone, my Lord, be the guilt.

301
00:14:54.465 --> 00:14:56.325
Please let your servant speak in your ears.

302
00:14:56.385 --> 00:14:57.725
Let hear the words of your servant.

303
00:14:58.305 --> 00:15:01.765
Let not my Lord regard this worthless fellow nal for

304
00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:02.805
as his name is.

305
00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:05.445
So is he. Nal is his name. Folly is with him.

306
00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:08.725
But I your servant did not see the young men

307
00:15:08.725 --> 00:15:09.805
of my Lord whom you sent.

308
00:15:10.865 --> 00:15:13.365
Now then my Lord, as the Lord, Yahweh lives

309
00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:14.525
as your soul lives

310
00:15:14.525 --> 00:15:17.725
because the Lord has restrained you from blood guilt

311
00:15:17.905 --> 00:15:19.445
and from saving with your own hand.

312
00:15:19.745 --> 00:15:20.965
Now then let your enemies

313
00:15:20.965 --> 00:15:24.005
and those who seek to do evil to my Lord be asal.

314
00:15:25.475 --> 00:15:27.495
And now let this present all the food

315
00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:30.255
that your servants brought to my Lord be given

316
00:15:30.255 --> 00:15:31.695
to the young men who follow my Lord.

317
00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:35.175
Please forgive the trespass of your servant.

318
00:15:35.915 --> 00:15:38.895
For the Lord will certainly make my Lord David a sure house

319
00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:41.535
because he's fighting the battles of the Lord.

320
00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:44.015
Evil shall not be found in you as long as you live.

321
00:15:45.115 --> 00:15:47.495
If men rise up to pursue you, seek your life.

322
00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:49.775
The life of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle

323
00:15:49.835 --> 00:15:52.415
of the living in the care of the Lord your God,

324
00:15:53.115 --> 00:15:55.375
the lives your enemies, he shall sling out

325
00:15:55.395 --> 00:15:56.615
as from the hall of a sling.

326
00:15:57.885 --> 00:16:00.545
And when the Lord Yahweh has done to my Lord, according

327
00:16:00.545 --> 00:16:02.545
to all the good that he's spoken concerning you

328
00:16:02.725 --> 00:16:04.225
and has appointed you prince

329
00:16:04.285 --> 00:16:08.745
or king over Israel, my Lord shall have no cause of grief

330
00:16:08.765 --> 00:16:12.065
or pangs of conscience for having shed blood without cause

331
00:16:12.525 --> 00:16:15.425
or for my Lord working salvation himself.

332
00:16:15.485 --> 00:16:17.505
And when the Lord's dealt well with you,

333
00:16:18.425 --> 00:16:22.175
remember your servant like is

334
00:16:22.175 --> 00:16:23.735
that not an incredible speech?

335
00:16:26.035 --> 00:16:27.935
She comes with such humility.

336
00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:32.015
She comes with such just grace

337
00:16:32.535 --> 00:16:34.175
dripping out of everything.

338
00:16:36.005 --> 00:16:40.575
Like she comes with this courage to meet this man,

339
00:16:40.675 --> 00:16:42.815
man she's never met before, who could take her life,

340
00:16:43.185 --> 00:16:46.095
who's coming to take her husband and all her family's life.

341
00:16:48.025 --> 00:16:50.325
She comes with such theological understanding

342
00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:51.845
of the whole situation, doesn't she?

343
00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:55.725
She knew exactly David's anointed role.

344
00:16:55.775 --> 00:16:57.725
She'd heard about Samuel anointed.

345
00:16:57.825 --> 00:16:59.845
She knew what David was called to do.

346
00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:01.445
She knew how that would play out.

347
00:17:01.585 --> 00:17:03.845
She also knew how that should play out.

348
00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:06.805
She remembered Samuel talking about

349
00:17:06.805 --> 00:17:07.885
the way the king should be.

350
00:17:08.065 --> 00:17:09.325
She knew God's character

351
00:17:09.465 --> 00:17:12.685
and so she knew David, you should never try

352
00:17:12.685 --> 00:17:15.005
to work salvation your own hands,

353
00:17:17.085 --> 00:17:19.355
never try to work it out yourself.

354
00:17:21.325 --> 00:17:25.615
It's not an amazing picture of grace through Abigail

355
00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:29.915
to David, like her wisdom on how

356
00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:30.955
to handle this situation.

357
00:17:31.085 --> 00:17:35.595
Again, grace in action to spare nial from being killed,

358
00:17:35.815 --> 00:17:37.915
to spare David from following some track.

359
00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:40.355
He didn't ne follow to spare all kinds of people.

360
00:17:40.355 --> 00:17:44.995
This is grace in action. How she do it. She told the truth.

361
00:17:46.575 --> 00:17:48.275
She reminded David of his calling.

362
00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:52.955
She refocused his mind back towards the Lord

363
00:17:55.955 --> 00:17:58.655
And she humbled herself even to the point

364
00:17:58.655 --> 00:18:01.415
where she took blame, where she had no blame.

365
00:18:03.195 --> 00:18:06.935
Remember that she wasn't involved. These men came to Nal.

366
00:18:06.995 --> 00:18:10.055
He was the one who spouted off. She was completely.

367
00:18:10.275 --> 00:18:11.935
And she had no idea this even happened.

368
00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:18.875
And yet she took the blame and watch how David responded.

369
00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:23.745
Look at verse 32. And David

370
00:18:23.855 --> 00:18:25.945
said to Abigail, blessed be the Lord.

371
00:18:26.165 --> 00:18:29.385
Yahweh, the God of Israel who sent you this day to meet me.

372
00:18:30.695 --> 00:18:33.385
Blessed be your discretion, your discernment.

373
00:18:33.725 --> 00:18:37.385
And blessed be you who've kept me this day from blood guilt

374
00:18:37.565 --> 00:18:41.545
and from working salvation with my own hand, for surely

375
00:18:41.545 --> 00:18:44.345
as the Lord, the God of Israel lives who's restrained me

376
00:18:44.345 --> 00:18:45.985
from hurting you unless you'd hurried

377
00:18:45.985 --> 00:18:47.105
and come to meet me truly

378
00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:49.505
by mourning there had not been left to the ball so much

379
00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:51.905
as one male, meaning I was gonna do

380
00:18:51.905 --> 00:18:53.225
this until you showed up.

381
00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:56.175
And then David received from her

382
00:18:56.175 --> 00:18:57.255
hand what she had brought him.

383
00:18:57.275 --> 00:18:59.575
And he said to her, go up in peace to your house.

384
00:19:00.355 --> 00:19:02.655
See, I've obeyed your voice. I've granted your petition.

385
00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:09.035
Abigail's plan worked right? See that it worked.

386
00:19:09.455 --> 00:19:12.435
And David, what we learned about him here is he continued

387
00:19:12.435 --> 00:19:14.115
growing in his obedience to the Lord.

388
00:19:16.175 --> 00:19:18.075
He was reminded that he was not supposed

389
00:19:18.075 --> 00:19:19.515
to take matters into his own hands.

390
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.955
He was supposed to trust the Lord to work it out himself.

391
00:19:23.135 --> 00:19:26.275
And he knew he needed that. God knew he needed that himself.

392
00:19:26.295 --> 00:19:30.265
He needed to grow and

393
00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:31.785
and watch how this has worked out.

394
00:19:31.785 --> 00:19:34.785
24, chapter 24, he had a test.

395
00:19:35.705 --> 00:19:37.985
I gotta trust God with Saul.

396
00:19:38.065 --> 00:19:39.065
I mean, he's right in front of me.

397
00:19:39.105 --> 00:19:41.665
I could take his life, but no God, I'm not supposed to touch

398
00:19:41.665 --> 00:19:43.465
or anointed here, okay?

399
00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:48.225
God, I'm not supposed to take out Nal who offended me.

400
00:19:48.325 --> 00:19:49.385
I'm not supposed to do that.

401
00:19:49.465 --> 00:19:50.745
I gotta trust you to work it out.

402
00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:53.385
And we'll see the full development of

403
00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:57.505
that next week in chapter 26 again with Saul

404
00:19:58.525 --> 00:20:00.935
that David grew into this

405
00:20:00.935 --> 00:20:05.425
Understanding And

406
00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:08.145
what a blessing Abigail was to David, right?

407
00:20:11.365 --> 00:20:15.565
She intervened, she reminded David of his calling,

408
00:20:15.945 --> 00:20:17.125
who he was in the Lord.

409
00:20:19.655 --> 00:20:23.435
She helped David overcome the temptation of vengeance.

410
00:20:26.405 --> 00:20:28.145
And as a result, David matured.

411
00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:31.785
Just reading this, I was reminded

412
00:20:31.845 --> 00:20:34.265
of Hebrews chapter three, verse 13.

413
00:20:34.365 --> 00:20:36.745
It says, exhort one another every day as long

414
00:20:36.745 --> 00:20:39.825
as it's called today, that none of you may be hardened

415
00:20:39.965 --> 00:20:41.345
by the deceitfulness of

416
00:20:41.485 --> 00:20:42.485
Sin.

417
00:20:43.695 --> 00:20:46.435
And David was deceived here by sin, wasn't it?

418
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:51.345
And we all need that. We all need people who willing

419
00:20:51.345 --> 00:20:54.025
to step into the gap that we, we get off track

420
00:20:54.085 --> 00:20:56.185
and we think we're doing right, but but no, we're not.

421
00:20:56.205 --> 00:20:57.945
And and God intervenes through someone.

422
00:20:58.085 --> 00:20:59.385
We all need people like that.

423
00:20:59.385 --> 00:21:01.425
We need parents who are going to help us

424
00:21:02.775 --> 00:21:05.065
stay away from foolishness as we grow and mature

425
00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:06.305
before we can make our own decisions.

426
00:21:08.165 --> 00:21:09.905
We need godly friends

427
00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:14.505
who will courageously call us out when we're about

428
00:21:14.505 --> 00:21:17.265
to walk down a path that will really hurt us and others.

429
00:21:19.355 --> 00:21:21.695
We need pastors who are willing to tell us the truth

430
00:21:22.295 --> 00:21:24.295
whenever we're wandering away from God's plan.

431
00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:29.605
We need church members to support us

432
00:21:30.105 --> 00:21:33.045
as we choose holiness over the ways of the world.

433
00:21:35.065 --> 00:21:39.395
Like we need people who will look at us and say truth to us.

434
00:21:39.645 --> 00:21:42.605
Every one of us needs that. And that's what happened here.

435
00:21:43.785 --> 00:21:48.685
And Abigail is held up in such high esteem as a result.

436
00:21:50.465 --> 00:21:52.605
In fact, I love how one preacher back in the 18

437
00:21:52.605 --> 00:21:53.925
hundreds described it.

438
00:21:54.745 --> 00:21:57.005
He says, Abigail is the conquerors,

439
00:21:58.225 --> 00:22:02.245
one woman in the right mightier than 400 men in the wrong.

440
00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:07.425
A hurricane stopped at the site of a water Lily

441
00:22:08.845 --> 00:22:11.895
Niagara dashed back by a drop of dew

442
00:22:13.675 --> 00:22:14.975
by her bravery intact.

443
00:22:15.165 --> 00:22:19.295
Abigail has saved her husband, saved her home, and put

444
00:22:19.295 --> 00:22:22.655
before all ages an illustrious specimen of

445
00:22:22.655 --> 00:22:26.215
what a woman can do if she's godly and prudent

446
00:22:26.395 --> 00:22:28.775
and self-sacrificing and vigilant

447
00:22:28.955 --> 00:22:30.655
and devoted to the interests of others.

448
00:22:32.965 --> 00:22:34.545
May we all be like Abigail.

449
00:22:37.765 --> 00:22:39.705
And so far so good in the story then, right?

450
00:22:42.285 --> 00:22:44.185
Yet here's the unanswered question so far.

451
00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:47.815
Listen, the ball gonna get away with this.

452
00:22:50.295 --> 00:22:54.475
He clearly was opposed to God by being opposed to David.

453
00:22:54.735 --> 00:22:57.955
And the way he handled David was completely ungodly.

454
00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:01.005
So was Neal gonna get away with this?

455
00:23:01.805 --> 00:23:03.405
I mean, David was gonna go take care of it.

456
00:23:04.305 --> 00:23:05.525
No, I gotta trust you. God.

457
00:23:06.545 --> 00:23:08.845
Was Neal going to get away with it?

458
00:23:10.035 --> 00:23:11.845
David's like, man, I trust you with Saul.

459
00:23:12.265 --> 00:23:16.745
Can I trust you with Neal? Well watch what God did.

460
00:23:16.745 --> 00:23:20.105
He used Abigail again in a way, starting in verse 36,

461
00:23:21.175 --> 00:23:22.385
Abigail came to Neal.

462
00:23:23.205 --> 00:23:24.905
Behold he was holding a feast in his house

463
00:23:24.905 --> 00:23:25.945
like the feast of a king.

464
00:23:26.225 --> 00:23:27.225
That's just pride, right?

465
00:23:27.345 --> 00:23:29.145
A lot of money thought he was king,

466
00:23:30.045 --> 00:23:31.665
and Neal's heart was married within him.

467
00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:32.905
He was very drunk. And

468
00:23:32.905 --> 00:23:35.225
so she told him nothing at all till the morning light in the

469
00:23:35.225 --> 00:23:36.745
morning when the wine had gone out of Nal.

470
00:23:36.805 --> 00:23:39.105
His wife told him these things

471
00:23:39.605 --> 00:23:41.185
and his heart died within him.

472
00:23:41.525 --> 00:23:42.705
And he became as a stone.

473
00:23:43.645 --> 00:23:44.865
And about 10 days later,

474
00:23:45.905 --> 00:23:48.885
the Lord struck Neal and he died.

475
00:23:51.215 --> 00:23:54.165
See that God worked it out.

476
00:23:55.585 --> 00:23:57.055
David didn't even have to lift a finger.

477
00:23:58.585 --> 00:24:00.645
In fact, that's what David says next in verse 39,

478
00:24:00.645 --> 00:24:03.245
when David heard that Neal was dead, he said,

479
00:24:03.355 --> 00:24:06.565
blessed be the Lord who has veed.

480
00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:09.045
The insult I received at the hand of Nal

481
00:24:09.705 --> 00:24:12.485
and has kept back his servant, meaning David,

482
00:24:13.145 --> 00:24:15.365
God kept me back from wrongdoing.

483
00:24:16.225 --> 00:24:20.925
The Lord has returned the evil of Nal on his own head.

484
00:24:23.265 --> 00:24:27.555
David's like, God did this. God delivered me.

485
00:24:28.655 --> 00:24:30.875
See it. It might be a little hard to understand

486
00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:33.115
or difficult to see in this passage,

487
00:24:33.295 --> 00:24:37.755
but the point that's being made is that God is sovereign

488
00:24:38.095 --> 00:24:41.115
and he has a purpose in redemption.

489
00:24:42.175 --> 00:24:43.995
He has a purpose in working out the

490
00:24:43.995 --> 00:24:45.555
deliverance of his people.

491
00:24:47.465 --> 00:24:50.165
He will always accomplish his plan.

492
00:24:53.215 --> 00:24:57.605
Now here's the thing on our side of that, the timing

493
00:24:59.175 --> 00:25:01.325
might not always work out like we think it should.

494
00:25:03.195 --> 00:25:08.005
Even the mechanism God uses the application of

495
00:25:08.005 --> 00:25:10.805
that may not be what we would selfishly want.

496
00:25:10.875 --> 00:25:13.045
Like it would've felt really good for David

497
00:25:13.385 --> 00:25:16.205
to walk into Neal's camp and just slaughter them.

498
00:25:17.305 --> 00:25:18.805
It would've been the absolute wrong thing to do,

499
00:25:20.475 --> 00:25:21.855
but that's what David would've preferred.

500
00:25:22.075 --> 00:25:26.895
But what we have to do is trust God's promise

501
00:25:27.165 --> 00:25:29.885
that he's working it out and he will.

502
00:25:32.825 --> 00:25:35.105
'cause remember for David, the Lord had promised David

503
00:25:35.105 --> 00:25:36.625
that he was going to be the king

504
00:25:38.845 --> 00:25:41.465
and he was going to eventually put all

505
00:25:41.465 --> 00:25:43.865
of David's enemies down before him.

506
00:25:45.835 --> 00:25:48.375
And so David has this opportunity to do it to Saul,

507
00:25:48.435 --> 00:25:49.455
to do it in Nal.

508
00:25:49.455 --> 00:25:50.935
Next week, we'll see him again with Saul.

509
00:25:50.935 --> 00:25:54.215
David had the opportunities and he had to trust God's timing

510
00:25:54.515 --> 00:25:55.815
and God's ways there.

511
00:25:56.365 --> 00:25:59.215
This scene is a reminder of that for David.

512
00:26:01.695 --> 00:26:04.225
Abigail completely understood that for David in many ways

513
00:26:05.035 --> 00:26:06.785
she's like, you know David, you're gonna be the king.

514
00:26:07.005 --> 00:26:08.585
We know that. And David, all your

515
00:26:08.585 --> 00:26:09.705
enemies are gonna be down before you.

516
00:26:09.925 --> 00:26:13.025
That's fine. But you can't take justice in your own hands.

517
00:26:14.685 --> 00:26:17.265
You've gotta remember that, David, you can't do that.

518
00:26:17.325 --> 00:26:20.865
You cannot work out salvation in your own hands.

519
00:26:21.485 --> 00:26:23.945
And what did David do whenever he heard of Neal's death?

520
00:26:25.605 --> 00:26:28.265
He was reminded again that that's what God does.

521
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:32.025
And just think of the encouragement it would've given him

522
00:26:32.535 --> 00:26:34.265
knowing that Saul was still out there

523
00:26:34.265 --> 00:26:36.185
somewhere coming after him.

524
00:26:37.745 --> 00:26:40.925
God said, you can trust me. He did within the ball.

525
00:26:41.145 --> 00:26:42.965
God took care of the ball. And so, you know,

526
00:26:43.045 --> 00:26:47.405
know David's like, all right God, I'll trust you with Saul

527
00:26:49.305 --> 00:26:50.645
and we'll see the full development of

528
00:26:50.645 --> 00:26:52.165
that next week in chapter 26.

529
00:26:54.295 --> 00:26:55.315
But really, that's the whole point.

530
00:26:55.315 --> 00:26:56.315
We've said over

531
00:26:56.315 --> 00:26:57.995
and over the last couple weeks, you see it here,

532
00:26:57.995 --> 00:27:00.875
when we trust God to do his work, when we don't take

533
00:27:01.505 --> 00:27:03.915
matters into our own hands, we trust him.

534
00:27:04.215 --> 00:27:05.635
He will work it out.

535
00:27:07.075 --> 00:27:09.665
Maybe not our time, maybe not our ways, but he will.

536
00:27:10.325 --> 00:27:11.345
He will work it out.

537
00:27:12.745 --> 00:27:15.545
I mean, just think about how David wrote this again.

538
00:27:15.545 --> 00:27:17.305
David was running away from Psalm,

539
00:27:17.305 --> 00:27:18.985
he's writing Psalms all in the caves.

540
00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:19.985
He's hiding in. But this is

541
00:27:19.985 --> 00:27:24.985
what he says in Psalm 57, Be merciful

542
00:27:25.435 --> 00:27:26.675
Oh God, be merciful to me.

543
00:27:26.775 --> 00:27:28.835
For in you, my soul takes refuge

544
00:27:30.285 --> 00:27:31.745
in the shadow of your wings.

545
00:27:31.905 --> 00:27:34.865
I will take refuge till the storms of destruction pass

546
00:27:34.965 --> 00:27:35.965
By.

547
00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:41.915
I cry out to God most high to God who fulfills his purpose

548
00:27:42.175 --> 00:27:46.585
for me in the cave running away

549
00:27:46.585 --> 00:27:47.745
from someone trying to kill him.

550
00:27:48.295 --> 00:27:50.345
He's like, God, God, I'm, I'm under your wings.

551
00:27:50.645 --> 00:27:51.865
I'm, I'm hiding in you.

552
00:27:53.265 --> 00:27:54.945
I trust you're gonna fulfill your purpose for me.

553
00:27:56.185 --> 00:27:58.315
Sure it doesn't look like it right now, but I trust you.

554
00:28:02.305 --> 00:28:07.165
Can we, can we trust the Lord in our

555
00:28:07.165 --> 00:28:11.165
time of need till the storms of destruction pass by?

556
00:28:13.285 --> 00:28:17.865
Can we trust our lives to him who judges justly

557
00:28:17.935 --> 00:28:21.625
that he will work out what he wants to happen in his time?

558
00:28:21.625 --> 00:28:22.985
And here's what can we trust him with that?

559
00:28:23.165 --> 00:28:24.985
Can we, David did, can we?

560
00:28:27.145 --> 00:28:30.035
Because he's got a purpose. God has a purpose in redemption.

561
00:28:30.035 --> 00:28:32.915
If we are his by faith in Jesus Christ,

562
00:28:33.095 --> 00:28:34.155
we know he has a purpose.

563
00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:37.195
And at the very least part of his purpose is

564
00:28:37.195 --> 00:28:38.875
that he's gonna take us home with him someday.

565
00:28:41.785 --> 00:28:44.365
And that simple truth, as much

566
00:28:44.365 --> 00:28:46.725
as things don't work out the way we want him to hear

567
00:28:47.075 --> 00:28:49.245
that simple truth, he's taken us home someday

568
00:28:49.715 --> 00:28:54.565
that can give us extreme ability to stand strong even today,

569
00:28:57.085 --> 00:29:00.585
To stand in hope in the face of whatever comes your way,

570
00:29:00.765 --> 00:29:04.225
no matter what it is, God can give you hope.

571
00:29:04.535 --> 00:29:06.025
Knowing that is coming

572
00:29:09.525 --> 00:29:14.405
even, even in the face of the temptations

573
00:29:15.275 --> 00:29:16.725
that like the waves on the beach.

574
00:29:16.915 --> 00:29:18.805
Just keep pounding your life.

575
00:29:21.545 --> 00:29:25.005
You can stand strong in hope even when

576
00:29:25.055 --> 00:29:26.685
those temptations

577
00:29:27.615 --> 00:29:28.615
Pound you.

578
00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:32.365
See, here's the thing about this passage, the surface

579
00:29:32.505 --> 00:29:34.085
of it, we kind of get it.

580
00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:36.205
We kind of understand it. But there's something going on

581
00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:38.325
much deeper below the surface here.

582
00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:43.565
Really this is a battle between the kingdom of God

583
00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:45.045
and the kingdom of Satan.

584
00:29:47.605 --> 00:29:50.015
Because the enemy of our souls brought this

585
00:29:50.535 --> 00:29:52.335
surprise attack on David.

586
00:29:54.515 --> 00:29:55.535
He knew who David was.

587
00:29:55.915 --> 00:29:57.295
He knew what David was supposed to be.

588
00:29:59.215 --> 00:30:02.395
And David's walking around the wilderness for years.

589
00:30:02.395 --> 00:30:05.315
Potentially. He knows Saul's a guy he's gotta worry about.

590
00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:07.195
And so he's always looking around for Saul.

591
00:30:07.195 --> 00:30:09.115
He's like, man, I gotta, where's Saul? Let's find out.

592
00:30:09.115 --> 00:30:10.995
Let's go the opposite way. Let's go around the mountain.

593
00:30:10.995 --> 00:30:13.915
Like he's looking for Saul. He knows that Saul is a threat.

594
00:30:14.015 --> 00:30:18.705
And then this Nal guy comes outta nowhere. Wait a second.

595
00:30:18.745 --> 00:30:20.945
I wasn't, look, hold up. I thought Saul was my problem.

596
00:30:22.005 --> 00:30:25.865
And now Na ball shows up. What was God doing?

597
00:30:27.635 --> 00:30:30.015
He was continuing to allow David to be tested,

598
00:30:31.075 --> 00:30:32.095
to grow his faith,

599
00:30:32.395 --> 00:30:35.775
to get attacked from a different direction, yet still have

600
00:30:35.775 --> 00:30:37.335
to trust God in the middle of it.

601
00:30:41.085 --> 00:30:43.785
Now, I love again how honest the Bible is.

602
00:30:44.225 --> 00:30:46.665
'cause David initially was gonna

603
00:30:46.665 --> 00:30:47.785
take things into his own hands.

604
00:30:48.085 --> 00:30:50.665
He was not handling this right from the beginning.

605
00:30:51.005 --> 00:30:54.825
But God graciously intervened through Abigail.

606
00:30:55.045 --> 00:30:58.345
And that is what led David to trust God in a new way.

607
00:31:04.145 --> 00:31:08.225
'cause remember the beginning said that Samuel had died.

608
00:31:10.865 --> 00:31:13.115
That adds a layer to this that says, you know what?

609
00:31:13.175 --> 00:31:15.235
Hey David, are you still gonna trust

610
00:31:15.655 --> 00:31:17.915
and obey even if Samuel's not around?

611
00:31:19.335 --> 00:31:21.065
Like you could go to Samuel and listen and,

612
00:31:21.065 --> 00:31:23.945
and think through and process how to handle this situation,

613
00:31:23.945 --> 00:31:25.705
but Samuel's not there anymore.

614
00:31:25.845 --> 00:31:28.345
Are you gonna handle it the same way God is continuing

615
00:31:28.365 --> 00:31:30.465
to layer tests on David's heart.

616
00:31:33.025 --> 00:31:35.895
James one says, know this, my beloved brothers,

617
00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:38.855
let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow

618
00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:40.655
to anger for the anger

619
00:31:40.675 --> 00:31:43.775
of man does not produce the righteousness of God.

620
00:31:46.135 --> 00:31:47.765
David, would you pass that test

621
00:31:49.095 --> 00:31:50.825
even without Samuel there to help you?

622
00:31:52.885 --> 00:31:55.745
And listen, this this matters not just for David's life

623
00:31:55.765 --> 00:31:58.665
or for the sparing of people in the family.

624
00:31:58.775 --> 00:32:00.465
This, this matters for David's life.

625
00:32:00.565 --> 00:32:01.905
Yes, but it also matters

626
00:32:01.905 --> 00:32:04.185
because the Messiah would eventually come

627
00:32:04.215 --> 00:32:05.385
from the line of David.

628
00:32:06.685 --> 00:32:09.505
And the question being asked here is, what kind

629
00:32:09.505 --> 00:32:12.545
of throne would that Messiah come to sit on?

630
00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:15.735
Would it be a throne of

631
00:32:16.395 --> 00:32:17.895
I'm taking justice into my own hands,

632
00:32:17.995 --> 00:32:19.055
I'm handling it myself.

633
00:32:19.315 --> 00:32:20.895
I'm gonna bring it about myself.

634
00:32:20.915 --> 00:32:23.575
Is that the kind of throne that the savior would come to?

635
00:32:23.915 --> 00:32:27.975
Or would it be a throne full of humility and sacrifice

636
00:32:28.635 --> 00:32:30.735
and trusting the Lord fully?

637
00:32:33.655 --> 00:32:35.395
So you see how this test matters for David,

638
00:32:35.455 --> 00:32:38.715
but it matters much more than that as well.

639
00:32:41.925 --> 00:32:44.575
Well, listen, church, we're we're not in the line of David.

640
00:32:44.585 --> 00:32:45.815
We're not in the line of the Messiah.

641
00:32:45.835 --> 00:32:50.815
We don't have to be held to that idea, but,

642
00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:54.255
but the same attacks that David was facing,

643
00:32:56.425 --> 00:32:57.685
we face every day as well.

644
00:33:01.975 --> 00:33:05.155
See second Corinthians two says that Satan is scheming

645
00:33:05.985 --> 00:33:09.185
against God's people trying

646
00:33:09.185 --> 00:33:12.185
to derail their lives away from God's plan and purpose.

647
00:33:13.205 --> 00:33:14.465
Is that not what he was doing with David?

648
00:33:15.295 --> 00:33:18.145
He's trying to scheme this way to get somebody else there.

649
00:33:19.355 --> 00:33:20.865
First Peter five, eight says,

650
00:33:21.115 --> 00:33:24.105
Satan is a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.

651
00:33:24.365 --> 00:33:25.665
Was that not what he was doing with David?

652
00:33:25.685 --> 00:33:28.185
He wanted to destroy David through this way.

653
00:33:28.445 --> 00:33:29.665
Is that not what he does with us?

654
00:33:31.285 --> 00:33:33.305
And listen, there's one thing we know about the enemy.

655
00:33:34.965 --> 00:33:38.305
He does not work most often through these

656
00:33:39.215 --> 00:33:41.105
full on from the front kind

657
00:33:41.105 --> 00:33:42.545
of assaults that you can see coming.

658
00:33:43.525 --> 00:33:45.575
Because then what we could do is we could prepare.

659
00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:48.695
We, we know it's coming. We can see the army this way.

660
00:33:48.695 --> 00:33:50.255
We can see the battle we can set up,

661
00:33:50.255 --> 00:33:51.815
we can prepare, we can know it's coming.

662
00:33:52.155 --> 00:33:53.855
That's not often how he works.

663
00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:58.375
He often brings his attacks in very surprising ways

664
00:34:00.135 --> 00:34:01.465
When we're not prepared for it.

665
00:34:01.665 --> 00:34:05.425
Whenever we're at our weakest or when things are unexpected.

666
00:34:08.355 --> 00:34:10.015
You've seen national Geographic, right?

667
00:34:10.015 --> 00:34:14.215
That gazelle goes off to drink, completely oblivious

668
00:34:14.215 --> 00:34:16.135
to the lions creeping through the grass,

669
00:34:16.285 --> 00:34:18.175
hunting it right next to it.

670
00:34:19.715 --> 00:34:23.015
It thinks it's safe, it has no expectations,

671
00:34:23.595 --> 00:34:25.495
and all of a sudden it gets taken.

672
00:34:28.825 --> 00:34:31.205
And so the enemy was coming after, sit after David.

673
00:34:34.195 --> 00:34:37.855
If the enemy's coming after us, then we better be prepared

674
00:34:37.855 --> 00:34:39.015
and know how to stand.

675
00:34:39.015 --> 00:34:43.295
Right? So how do we do that?

676
00:34:45.075 --> 00:34:47.455
How can we overcome temptation?

677
00:34:49.905 --> 00:34:54.635
There's only one way through the hope of Christ

678
00:34:55.335 --> 00:34:57.795
who offers us victory.

679
00:35:01.985 --> 00:35:03.495
Don't walk away from here saying, well,

680
00:35:03.495 --> 00:35:05.135
I gotta try harder to overcome temptation.

681
00:35:05.235 --> 00:35:06.775
The only hope you have

682
00:35:06.835 --> 00:35:10.295
and I have is to rest in the victory

683
00:35:10.955 --> 00:35:12.015
of Christ.

684
00:35:12.035 --> 00:35:15.855
Listen Christ who, who not only defeated sin

685
00:35:15.855 --> 00:35:17.495
and temptation by living a perfect life,

686
00:35:17.855 --> 00:35:19.015
resurrecting from the grave, but

687
00:35:19.015 --> 00:35:23.255
who also offers us victory when we face temptation.

688
00:35:25.255 --> 00:35:28.875
Now, he might actually send a physical person

689
00:35:29.175 --> 00:35:31.355
to be the intervention just like Abigail was for Dave.

690
00:35:31.375 --> 00:35:34.075
He might do that. He's done it in my life.

691
00:35:34.185 --> 00:35:36.795
He's probably done it in most of our lives. He might.

692
00:35:39.205 --> 00:35:42.625
But listen, he providentially promises

693
00:35:43.005 --> 00:35:46.345
to intervene in one specific way.

694
00:35:46.605 --> 00:35:48.545
As one Corinthians 10 13 says,

695
00:35:49.045 --> 00:35:51.025
no temptation has overtaken you.

696
00:35:51.095 --> 00:35:54.225
That is not common to man. Meaning we all face them.

697
00:35:54.845 --> 00:35:56.705
God is faithful

698
00:35:56.885 --> 00:36:00.185
and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability.

699
00:36:00.565 --> 00:36:04.585
But with the temptation, he will also provide the way

700
00:36:04.685 --> 00:36:08.345
of escape that you may be able to endure it.

701
00:36:10.925 --> 00:36:12.085
I know what it feels like

702
00:36:12.275 --> 00:36:15.005
that you feel like there's no way I can't do

703
00:36:15.395 --> 00:36:17.205
what this temptation is asking me to do.

704
00:36:17.865 --> 00:36:19.285
It can feel like there's no way out.

705
00:36:19.385 --> 00:36:21.565
It can feel like you just have to sin.

706
00:36:23.065 --> 00:36:24.805
But if you are in Christ, listen,

707
00:36:24.825 --> 00:36:28.005
if you get nothing else today, if you are in Christ

708
00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:32.205
by faith, if you are his, you don't have give in.

709
00:36:36.545 --> 00:36:39.165
You don't have to like, even if that's just your phrase.

710
00:36:39.165 --> 00:36:41.485
Like, I don't have to do that. I don't have to.

711
00:36:43.345 --> 00:36:45.205
Now, why can you say that with such confidence?

712
00:36:47.355 --> 00:36:49.765
Because If you're in Christ, you are a new

713
00:36:50.525 --> 00:36:52.125
creation in Christ.

714
00:36:53.145 --> 00:36:54.565
And Galatians two 20 says,

715
00:36:54.805 --> 00:36:56.765
I have been crucified with Christ.

716
00:36:57.325 --> 00:37:01.925
I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.

717
00:37:04.545 --> 00:37:06.765
So how can you say I, I don't have to do that.

718
00:37:07.605 --> 00:37:08.965
I don't have to take vengeance.

719
00:37:09.215 --> 00:37:11.565
David would've said, I don't have to do that. Why?

720
00:37:11.635 --> 00:37:14.645
Because you have a savior

721
00:37:15.185 --> 00:37:17.805
who lives his life through you.

722
00:37:18.715 --> 00:37:20.845
That means you don't have to fight it on your own.

723
00:37:20.865 --> 00:37:22.125
You don't have to fight it yourself.

724
00:37:22.225 --> 00:37:23.245
You can just let him fight.

725
00:37:23.285 --> 00:37:25.165
I I no longer live Christ lives in me.

726
00:37:25.335 --> 00:37:26.805
Jesus, you gotta do this right?

727
00:37:29.815 --> 00:37:30.845
Isn't that good news?

728
00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:33.445
Because listen, I know I'm not

729
00:37:33.445 --> 00:37:34.685
strong enough to fight temptation.

730
00:37:35.565 --> 00:37:37.765
I know how weak I, how I give in

731
00:37:38.345 --> 00:37:41.005
so quickly when I'm trusting myself, man, it's,

732
00:37:41.155 --> 00:37:42.805
it's almost instantaneous.

733
00:37:46.405 --> 00:37:49.605
I need someone who's overcome it for me.

734
00:37:51.005 --> 00:37:52.885
I need a victor to stand in my place

735
00:37:52.885 --> 00:37:54.005
and fight the battle for me.

736
00:37:54.065 --> 00:37:57.605
That's what I need. And praise God

737
00:37:57.755 --> 00:37:59.805
that he has provided that

738
00:38:00.025 --> 00:38:02.965
For me, And he's provided that for you.

739
00:38:02.985 --> 00:38:04.725
If we rest in the victory

740
00:38:05.105 --> 00:38:08.205
and the power of Jesus, the overcomer.
