1
00:00:19.265 --> 00:00:20.475
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.635
It is really good to see you all this morning,

3
00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:23.755
especially you students.

4
00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:26.675
I hope you all survived the weekend. Are we awake?

5
00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:30.155
You guys with me? That was really,

6
00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:33.275
there might be some sleeping here this morning.

7
00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:37.115
We'll see. Well, I, if you haven't, if I haven't met you

8
00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:38.195
yet, my name is Chris Cross.

9
00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:39.835
I'm one of the elders here.

10
00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:41.875
It's my privilege to serve you in that way

11
00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:45.275
and I'm excited to get back into our study

12
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.715
of First Samuel this morning.

13
00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:50.555
As much as I pushed for a Song of Solomon Study

14
00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:51.995
to celebrate Valentine's Day,

15
00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:54.275
this is probably the better option this morning.

16
00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.555
But before we get into First Samuel,

17
00:00:58.685 --> 00:00:59.955
let's start with a little story.

18
00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:04.795
So back in 1946, there were two gentlemen, one by the name

19
00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:07.635
of a Bookman and the other Albert C. Carter,

20
00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.755
and they introduced the world to this little device

21
00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:12.675
that if you shook it up, it would give you a

22
00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.195
randomly generated answer.

23
00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:18.075
Well, a couple of years later, in 1950,

24
00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:21.435
a company called Brunswick Billiards commissioned these men

25
00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:22.595
to take that toy

26
00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.875
and repackage it into a promotional

27
00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:25.995
product that they could use.

28
00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:29.235
And that's when it became known as the Magic eight Ball.

29
00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:32.715
Now this is the knockoff version that you can get

30
00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:36.035
for like 800 tickets at Main Event if you wanna make a trip

31
00:01:36.465 --> 00:01:37.555
over after church.

32
00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:41.435
Uh, but I'm sure most of us had one of these little vices,

33
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:43.235
or at least knew someone that did as a kid.

34
00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:47.195
And we used to ask some of our most deepest,

35
00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:49.915
profound life questions of these little things.

36
00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:54.915
Questions like, does Jimmy have a crush on Marisa?

37
00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.195
And if you were like my sister,

38
00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:01.035
maybe you were asking questions like, will I get

39
00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:02.595
to marry Jonathan Taylor Thomas?

40
00:02:05.015 --> 00:02:06.915
Or perhaps you have questions like me?

41
00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:09.195
Questions like, is this the year

42
00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:12.475
that the Dallas Cowboys finally win a Super Bowl?

43
00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:15.195
Yeah, yeah. You guys right?

44
00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:18.155
The answer is always wouldn't bet on it, right?

45
00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:24.195
Well, as we grow up, we stop using these little devices

46
00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:27.355
to answer our questions, but wouldn't it be nice if we had

47
00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:29.515
something like this that we could call on, right?

48
00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.955
To answer those questions that we have now, questions like,

49
00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:35.235
should I take that job

50
00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:38.435
or is this the right person for me to marry?

51
00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:40.435
Or how about this one?

52
00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:43.235
How about, uh, should I quit my job

53
00:02:43.615 --> 00:02:46.675
and live overseas as a missionary live since, right?

54
00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:52.665
Or how about should I forgive that family member who hurt me

55
00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:56.435
and if I do, do I let them back into my life?

56
00:02:58.195 --> 00:03:00.685
You see, we have these questions as humans,

57
00:03:00.685 --> 00:03:03.725
because we are so limited in our knowledge,

58
00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:05.965
we don't know what's around the corner,

59
00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:08.805
we don't know what's gonna lead to the best outcomes.

60
00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.125
And if I'm honest, I ask these questions

61
00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.005
because I just wanna know what's gonna make me happiest

62
00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.165
or at least the most comfortable in life.

63
00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:18.845
Or perhaps we don't ask these questions at all

64
00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:20.925
because we just assume we already know what's best

65
00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:23.045
for our lives, and so we just act accordingly.

66
00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:28.125
But in our better moments, I think we ask these questions

67
00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:31.205
because we actually, we truly want to know

68
00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:32.285
what God's will is.

69
00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:37.095
You see, at least in our limited knowledge, we understand

70
00:03:37.095 --> 00:03:38.855
that he is unlimited in his.

71
00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:42.295
At least we understand that he does have a plan

72
00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:45.975
and at least we understand that he is mindful of us.

73
00:03:46.675 --> 00:03:49.775
Yet oftentimes I think we struggle with this question

74
00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:52.415
of discerning what is God's will.

75
00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:55.295
Now let me be perfectly clear.

76
00:03:56.565 --> 00:03:58.085
I don't want you to be misled this morning.

77
00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:01.165
God is not some magic eight ball that we just shake up

78
00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:03.645
and peer into whenever we have a decision

79
00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:04.725
that we need to make in life.

80
00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:07.845
Now, what we'll see today is that God is actually

81
00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:09.525
so much better than that

82
00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:12.125
and the way that he works with us to reveal his will.

83
00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:17.855
So as we continue in one Samuel this morning, we will see

84
00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:18.855
through the life of David

85
00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:22.735
that God does reveal his will to his people.

86
00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:26.335
The question then becomes are we a people

87
00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.015
who inquire of him?

88
00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.975
Are we a people who listen

89
00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:33.615
and obey to the will that he does reveal to us?

90
00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:37.575
So to see how that plays out in David's story,

91
00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:40.375
let us turn now to God's revealed words.

92
00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:42.055
So please turn with me in your Bibles

93
00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:44.375
to First Samuel chapter 23.

94
00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:49.845
And as you make your way there, let's go before the Lord

95
00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:51.685
and let's seek him out in prayer

96
00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:53.325
because we do need him this morning.

97
00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:56.005
So Father, we come before you this morning

98
00:04:57.185 --> 00:04:59.085
and we open up our hearts to you.

99
00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:03.605
God give us ears that hear your word, give us hearts

100
00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:04.965
that are submitted to your will.

101
00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:06.965
Speak to us through your living

102
00:05:07.065 --> 00:05:08.605
and active word this morning.

103
00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:13.365
We trust what you promise is true, that you will speak

104
00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:15.045
to us if we seek you, Lord.

105
00:05:15.505 --> 00:05:18.485
So speak to us this morning, submit our hearts to you.

106
00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:20.485
It's in your name we pray. Amen.

107
00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:24.965
So starting in chapter 23, verse one says,

108
00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:26.045
now they told David,

109
00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:29.925
behold the Philistines are fighting against keila

110
00:05:30.265 --> 00:05:32.045
and are robbing the threshing floors.

111
00:05:32.945 --> 00:05:34.525
So let's, let's stop there.

112
00:05:34.525 --> 00:05:37.325
Before we get too far into this story,

113
00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:39.965
let's get our bearings with where we are,

114
00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:41.365
where we're at in First Samuel.

115
00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:43.205
Remember first Samuel is a narrative.

116
00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:46.565
So it's important that we look at each individual story in

117
00:05:46.725 --> 00:05:47.725
the context of the,

118
00:05:47.725 --> 00:05:49.565
of the greater plot that's being told here.

119
00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:51.285
So how did we get here?

120
00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:54.765
Well, if you recall over the last few chapters, we know

121
00:05:54.765 --> 00:05:57.125
that David is on the run from King Saul.

122
00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:01.205
So Saul was God's first appointed king of Israel,

123
00:06:01.665 --> 00:06:03.605
yet he has been rejected by God

124
00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:06.765
because of this pattern of blatant disobedience

125
00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:09.045
that he continues to have against God's will.

126
00:06:09.945 --> 00:06:13.405
And we learned in chapter 16 that God has appointed David

127
00:06:14.155 --> 00:06:15.285
described as a man

128
00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:19.965
after God's own heart to succeed King Saul as the next

129
00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:21.845
uh, heir to the throne.

130
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.045
And as God has brought success

131
00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:27.165
after success to David, David's popularity

132
00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:30.005
amongst the people of Israel has continued to increase.

133
00:06:30.385 --> 00:06:31.485
But along with that,

134
00:06:32.105 --> 00:06:35.165
Saul's jealousy has also continued to increase.

135
00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:40.725
And we see King Saul refusing to accept God's will for him

136
00:06:40.745 --> 00:06:44.605
and the kingdom, and he becomes obsessed with killing David

137
00:06:44.945 --> 00:06:46.525
and eliminating him from the picture.

138
00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:49.685
You see, Saul appears to believe that he has the power

139
00:06:49.705 --> 00:06:51.565
to force his own will

140
00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:55.605
and becoming reality in spite of what God has clearly

141
00:06:56.355 --> 00:06:58.965
told to him, clearly revealed to him that there was

142
00:06:58.965 --> 00:07:01.365
to be another that was going to inherit the throne.

143
00:07:02.695 --> 00:07:06.355
So over the last couple of weeks, we have seen Saul's

144
00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:11.755
continue spiral into this self obsession that has led him

145
00:07:11.775 --> 00:07:14.635
to completely distort his perception of reality.

146
00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:18.115
And this is what we saw last week when he came to Knob

147
00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:19.755
and massacred the city of Knob.

148
00:07:20.215 --> 00:07:24.555
And along with it, 85 priests of the Lord and the women

149
00:07:24.615 --> 00:07:27.235
and the children, all Israelites, all his own people,

150
00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:31.995
he massacres there except for there's one priest

151
00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:36.115
that escapes Knob Abiathar and he flees to David

152
00:07:36.215 --> 00:07:38.475
and we'll see him show up today in our story.

153
00:07:38.575 --> 00:07:41.635
So with that, that all brings us to chapter 23.

154
00:07:42.655 --> 00:07:45.435
And with that context, let's start back again in verse one.

155
00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:48.155
Now they told David,

156
00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.915
behold the Philistines are fighting against keah

157
00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:53.995
and are robbing the threshing floors.

158
00:07:54.865 --> 00:07:58.715
Therefore, David inquired of the Lord, shall I go

159
00:07:58.735 --> 00:08:00.275
and attack these Philistines?

160
00:08:01.055 --> 00:08:04.315
And the Lord said to David, go and attack the Philistines

161
00:08:04.335 --> 00:08:05.675
and save keah.

162
00:08:06.615 --> 00:08:09.035
But David's man said to him, behold,

163
00:08:09.335 --> 00:08:12.835
we are afraid here in Judah how much more than if we go

164
00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:15.115
to Keah against the armies of the Philistines.

165
00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:18.495
Then David inquired of the Lord again,

166
00:08:18.515 --> 00:08:21.455
and the Lord answered him, arise, go down to Keah

167
00:08:21.515 --> 00:08:23.935
for I will give the Philistines into your hand.

168
00:08:25.075 --> 00:08:27.495
And David and his men went tequila

169
00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:29.175
and fought with the Philistines

170
00:08:29.515 --> 00:08:31.135
and brought away their livestock

171
00:08:31.515 --> 00:08:33.415
and struck them with a great blow.

172
00:08:33.715 --> 00:08:37.135
So David saved the inhabitants of Kela.

173
00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:40.495
So the last time that we saw David, he

174
00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:42.935
and his men were hiding out in the forest

175
00:08:43.035 --> 00:08:44.415
of Herath and Judah.

176
00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:45.935
Now how did they get there?

177
00:08:46.605 --> 00:08:48.655
Well, if you remember back in chapter 22,

178
00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:52.695
the prophet Gad had instructed David to get out

179
00:08:52.695 --> 00:08:54.535
of the strongholds in which they were hiding

180
00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:56.525
and go into the land of Judah.

181
00:08:57.465 --> 00:09:00.125
Now, on the surface, this does not seem like the most

182
00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:03.365
strategic move, move for David to do because he,

183
00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:05.725
after all, he's trying to hide from Saul, right?

184
00:09:06.825 --> 00:09:08.725
So why would he want to go to Judah?

185
00:09:08.855 --> 00:09:10.125
Where, where Saul

186
00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:12.925
and all of his allies would be crawling all over

187
00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:17.085
that land looking for David know the most strategic thing

188
00:09:17.085 --> 00:09:19.685
that David could have done, the safest thing to do,

189
00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:22.205
the most reasonable thing to do would've been

190
00:09:22.205 --> 00:09:25.405
to stay in the strongholds away from kings Saul

191
00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:27.405
where he could not find them.

192
00:09:27.705 --> 00:09:30.765
But nevertheless, David is there in the strongholds waiting

193
00:09:31.265 --> 00:09:33.325
for God to tell him what to do next.

194
00:09:35.035 --> 00:09:38.535
You see, God has been conditioning David to be still enough

195
00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:40.055
to listen to his will.

196
00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:43.535
And this is quite the change from the fear-driven antics

197
00:09:43.535 --> 00:09:46.255
that we saw in David early on in his flight from Saul,

198
00:09:46.725 --> 00:09:50.135
that was the David that we saw deceive a alek, the priest

199
00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:52.215
to get provisions from him.

200
00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:55.735
That was the David that we saw pretending to be a mad man,

201
00:09:55.735 --> 00:09:58.775
pretending to be crazy, to get away from the Philistines

202
00:09:58.775 --> 00:10:03.385
and Gath right now, you see David has quieted,

203
00:10:03.765 --> 00:10:05.745
or sorry, God has quieted David's heart

204
00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:08.305
and refocused David's attention

205
00:10:08.885 --> 00:10:11.705
and turned his ear back towards him to listen.

206
00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:16.465
And David says so himself in thinking about these events,

207
00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:21.065
he writes in Psalm 56, he says this, I know that God is

208
00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:25.945
for me and God whose word I praise in the Lord whose word I

209
00:10:25.945 --> 00:10:28.585
praise and God I trust

210
00:10:29.705 --> 00:10:30.945
I shall not be afraid.

211
00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:32.585
What can man do to me?

212
00:10:34.045 --> 00:10:37.025
See, David's trust now is in whatever God has for him

213
00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:41.225
wherever God wants him to go, no matter how sensible

214
00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:45.905
or nons sensible it might seem, he is quiet now

215
00:10:45.905 --> 00:10:48.665
and he is settled even in the middle of this storm

216
00:10:48.735 --> 00:10:50.225
that he finds himself in.

217
00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:54.945
Because even in the middle of that storm, David is confident

218
00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:58.385
that he is carried along by the one who shows the wind how

219
00:10:58.385 --> 00:11:00.705
to blow and tells the rain where to fall.

220
00:11:01.765 --> 00:11:04.825
So when God tells him through the prophet Gad, get up,

221
00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:06.865
get out of the strongholds

222
00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:10.185
and go into the land of Judah, he doesn't hesitate.

223
00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:12.385
He doesn't need to know why.

224
00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:14.985
He just gets up and he goes,

225
00:11:15.485 --> 00:11:17.345
and then he waits there in Judah for

226
00:11:17.345 --> 00:11:20.765
what the Lord will do next and what the Lord does next

227
00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:23.365
and bring him word from Keah

228
00:11:23.675 --> 00:11:26.525
that the Philistines are oppressing the Israelites there.

229
00:11:27.575 --> 00:11:30.075
And here we see David's dilemma.

230
00:11:31.855 --> 00:11:34.155
So Keila was a fortified city

231
00:11:35.015 --> 00:11:39.235
in Judah about 20 miles to the south and west of Jerusalem.

232
00:11:40.255 --> 00:11:43.795
And we hear here that David gets word

233
00:11:43.795 --> 00:11:46.075
that the Philistines are pressing the Israelites there

234
00:11:46.075 --> 00:11:47.675
by robbing the threshing floors.

235
00:11:48.015 --> 00:11:50.355
The, so the threshing floors would've been these areas

236
00:11:50.665 --> 00:11:52.515
outside of the city walls

237
00:11:52.935 --> 00:11:55.125
where the Israelite farmers would've been bringing in their

238
00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:57.405
grain to be stamped out and processed into food.

239
00:11:58.145 --> 00:11:59.645
So when the Philistines are coming

240
00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:02.245
and oppressing the Israelite farmers there,

241
00:12:02.245 --> 00:12:04.125
they're robbing them of the fruits of their labor.

242
00:12:04.665 --> 00:12:07.125
But not only that, they're cutting off supply lines,

243
00:12:07.715 --> 00:12:10.245
food supply for the city of Kila.

244
00:12:11.025 --> 00:12:13.605
And so you can see this is a pretty desperate situation

245
00:12:13.955 --> 00:12:15.845
that Keah finds itself in.

246
00:12:16.705 --> 00:12:18.885
And so they put out this call for help

247
00:12:19.545 --> 00:12:23.085
and the call comes to David as he's in the forest of Herath.

248
00:12:24.025 --> 00:12:26.325
Now, it's interesting that this call comes to David.

249
00:12:27.505 --> 00:12:30.165
Why not Saul? Saul's the king.

250
00:12:31.715 --> 00:12:34.175
Saul's the one that God tells in chapter nine

251
00:12:34.235 --> 00:12:36.615
to save the Israelite people from the

252
00:12:36.615 --> 00:12:37.655
hand of the Philistines.

253
00:12:37.705 --> 00:12:40.855
Isn't this Saul's responsibility to come to the rescue

254
00:12:40.955 --> 00:12:45.375
of Keah or perhaps the call does come to Saul

255
00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:46.615
and he just ignores it?

256
00:12:47.645 --> 00:12:50.775
Perhaps Saul is too busy with his conquest

257
00:12:50.835 --> 00:12:52.735
to hunt down David and kill David,

258
00:12:53.165 --> 00:12:55.535
that he completely ignores his responsibility

259
00:12:55.555 --> 00:12:58.375
to his own people and doesn't come to Keah.

260
00:12:59.275 --> 00:13:02.895
Now, we don't know for certain why Saul isn't in Keah

261
00:13:02.895 --> 00:13:04.055
or why Saul didn't come,

262
00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:08.535
but we do know that the call goes out to David for help.

263
00:13:09.275 --> 00:13:11.855
And so what does David do here?

264
00:13:11.855 --> 00:13:14.855
He is hiding out for his life in Judah,

265
00:13:15.075 --> 00:13:17.295
and yet he is faced with this decision

266
00:13:17.445 --> 00:13:19.815
because his neighbors over here need help.

267
00:13:19.845 --> 00:13:21.255
They find themselves in a crisis.

268
00:13:22.915 --> 00:13:24.175
So stop and think for a second.

269
00:13:24.285 --> 00:13:27.775
What would you do in this moment? Or what would I do?

270
00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:32.925
On the one hand, we might be tempted to think, well man,

271
00:13:32.955 --> 00:13:35.045
I've got enough on my plate as it is.

272
00:13:35.155 --> 00:13:37.565
I've got Saul breathing down my neck,

273
00:13:37.565 --> 00:13:39.885
I've got his spies crawling all over

274
00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.085
the land looking for me.

275
00:13:41.435 --> 00:13:45.165
I've got these 400 men here who are all looking to me

276
00:13:45.585 --> 00:13:48.165
to give them guidance to help them, to protect them,

277
00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:49.525
to lead them in right ways.

278
00:13:50.585 --> 00:13:52.565
Now, I understand this, there's a problem here,

279
00:13:52.585 --> 00:13:55.365
but surely this isn't my responsibility at the time.

280
00:13:57.005 --> 00:13:59.025
Or perhaps we'd be on the other side of that coin

281
00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:02.865
and we would hear of this crisis, someone in need of help,

282
00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:04.185
and we would just jump right in

283
00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:05.985
and say, well man, I can fix that.

284
00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:08.505
Come on guys, let's go. Let's go take care of this situation

285
00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:09.825
and jump right in.

286
00:14:11.375 --> 00:14:13.285
Might suggest that actually both

287
00:14:13.665 --> 00:14:15.645
of those responses would be wrong.

288
00:14:16.945 --> 00:14:19.195
Instead, let's look at what David does here.

289
00:14:20.015 --> 00:14:21.355
You'll see it in verse two.

290
00:14:21.855 --> 00:14:25.195
It says, therefore David inquired of the Lord,

291
00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.675
shall I go and attack these Philistines?

292
00:14:29.175 --> 00:14:32.875
And the Lord said to David, go and attack the Philistines

293
00:14:32.875 --> 00:14:34.035
and save keah.

294
00:14:34.935 --> 00:14:38.275
You see, before taking any action, David wanted to know

295
00:14:38.275 --> 00:14:39.275
what God's will was.

296
00:14:39.855 --> 00:14:41.275
So we brought it before him.

297
00:14:42.495 --> 00:14:44.435
And this is the first principle that I want us

298
00:14:44.435 --> 00:14:47.555
to learn this morning, that if we really want to know

299
00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:48.635
what God's will is,

300
00:14:49.865 --> 00:14:51.740
and I know I have all of you, you hanging on the edge

301
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.045
of your seats because we all wanna

302
00:14:53.045 --> 00:14:54.205
know what God's will is, right?

303
00:14:54.945 --> 00:14:57.965
But listen, if we really wanna know what God's will is,

304
00:14:58.945 --> 00:15:00.165
we should seek him.

305
00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:04.675
Now you're probably thinking, well, gee, Chris, thank you,

306
00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:05.795
captain obvious, right?

307
00:15:07.385 --> 00:15:10.795
Yeah, captain obvious. But listen, think about this.

308
00:15:11.635 --> 00:15:14.715
I think there's oftentimes that we think we want

309
00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:15.835
to know what God's will is.

310
00:15:15.895 --> 00:15:18.115
Or we say we wanna know what God's will is,

311
00:15:18.695 --> 00:15:20.355
but we don't actually ask him.

312
00:15:21.535 --> 00:15:23.715
We don't actually seek him.

313
00:15:24.935 --> 00:15:28.755
We don't look for what he's revealed His will already to be,

314
00:15:32.145 --> 00:15:34.885
or perhaps we do ask him, but it's only

315
00:15:34.895 --> 00:15:37.965
after we've already decided for ourselves what, what he,

316
00:15:37.965 --> 00:15:39.525
what we want his will to be.

317
00:15:40.855 --> 00:15:44.075
And trust me, we are awfully good at convincing ourselves

318
00:15:44.075 --> 00:15:47.475
that God's will aligns with our own if we're not careful.

319
00:15:48.895 --> 00:15:50.795
In fact, we're gonna see an example of

320
00:15:50.795 --> 00:15:52.995
that played out in just a few verses ahead.

321
00:15:54.095 --> 00:15:55.515
But this isn't what David does.

322
00:15:56.805 --> 00:15:58.345
He is presented with information,

323
00:15:59.015 --> 00:16:00.985
this opportunity to make a decision.

324
00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:03.545
And before he does anything else, he brings it

325
00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:06.265
before the Lord and says, God, what would you have me do?

326
00:16:07.715 --> 00:16:11.425
Shall I go down? Shall I save keah?

327
00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.225
Now, it doesn't tell us exactly

328
00:16:14.525 --> 00:16:16.345
how David inquires of the Lord here.

329
00:16:16.345 --> 00:16:18.065
Perhaps it was through the prophet Gad

330
00:16:18.365 --> 00:16:19.705
who we assume is still with him,

331
00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.705
or perhaps it was directly in prayer.

332
00:16:22.725 --> 00:16:25.025
We don't really know. But what we do know is that God

333
00:16:25.655 --> 00:16:29.785
clearly tells him, yes, go and save Keah.

334
00:16:30.685 --> 00:16:32.505
But remember David isn't alone here.

335
00:16:33.215 --> 00:16:36.625
He's got this ragtag army of 400 misfit men that are

336
00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:39.025
with him, and they're not so convinced about

337
00:16:39.025 --> 00:16:40.665
where David says God is leading them.

338
00:16:41.845 --> 00:16:44.145
See that in verse three, they come against him

339
00:16:44.145 --> 00:16:46.785
and say, behold, we are afraid here in Judah

340
00:16:47.405 --> 00:16:50.865
how much more than if we go to keah against the armies

341
00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:51.905
of the Philistines?

342
00:16:53.105 --> 00:16:55.605
And their response really isn't all that surprising, right?

343
00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:59.205
I mean, we can understand the position that they're in to go

344
00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:02.285
to Keah, to fight against the Philistines would've been

345
00:17:02.285 --> 00:17:04.125
putting them in danger enough as it is.

346
00:17:04.985 --> 00:17:07.045
But even more so than that, by going there,

347
00:17:07.045 --> 00:17:09.325
they would be outing themselves to Saul, the one

348
00:17:09.325 --> 00:17:10.365
that they've been hiding from,

349
00:17:10.745 --> 00:17:13.205
and he would know exactly where they were.

350
00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:16.605
And you know this, this reminds me

351
00:17:16.605 --> 00:17:19.565
that there are many times when God has clearly given his

352
00:17:19.565 --> 00:17:23.535
will to us and it doesn't make sense to others,

353
00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:26.455
especially sometimes those that are closest to us.

354
00:17:27.595 --> 00:17:30.855
And we are often faced with opposition that tells us, well,

355
00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:32.375
that doesn't really seem wise

356
00:17:32.475 --> 00:17:36.005
or That's not what I would do, but get this.

357
00:17:36.005 --> 00:17:39.085
Isn't that so true of God's clearly expressed

358
00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:40.605
will in his word?

359
00:17:40.715 --> 00:17:44.605
Sometimes it doesn't often make sense, at least to

360
00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:47.165
what makes sense to to humanity, right to us.

361
00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:52.605
Yet we see Jesus tell us things like love your

362
00:17:52.715 --> 00:17:54.645
enemies what?

363
00:17:55.875 --> 00:18:00.675
Pray for those who persecute you. Or what about this one?

364
00:18:00.695 --> 00:18:02.275
If someone sues you

365
00:18:02.275 --> 00:18:05.075
and takes your shirt, well just give him your coat.

366
00:18:05.105 --> 00:18:09.715
Also are are you serious Jesus? Like, think about that.

367
00:18:10.735 --> 00:18:14.675
Yet, God's ways, his will are

368
00:18:14.935 --> 00:18:17.475
so much better than our ways.

369
00:18:18.215 --> 00:18:20.915
His definition of wisdom is so much better,

370
00:18:21.055 --> 00:18:22.795
so much higher than ours.

371
00:18:23.965 --> 00:18:27.705
So David here, he hears the concerns of his men,

372
00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:29.665
valid concerns in the human sense.

373
00:18:30.205 --> 00:18:33.305
And what does he do? Does he counter back?

374
00:18:34.175 --> 00:18:35.345
Does he just ignore them?

375
00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:38.345
Does he give in to the majority opinion

376
00:18:38.445 --> 00:18:39.745
and not go down to keah?

377
00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:43.585
No. What does he do? Tells us in verse four that again,

378
00:18:44.005 --> 00:18:46.225
he inquires of the Lord.

379
00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:51.235
And then it says, the Lord answered him, arise, go down

380
00:18:51.235 --> 00:18:54.555
to keah for I will give the Philistines into your hand.

381
00:18:54.575 --> 00:18:55.675
Now, isn't that beautiful?

382
00:18:56.815 --> 00:19:01.035
Not only does God tell David what he want,

383
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.635
what he wants he and his men to do,

384
00:19:02.935 --> 00:19:04.435
but he gives him this promise

385
00:19:04.465 --> 00:19:07.435
that he will give him the victory over the Philistines.

386
00:19:09.225 --> 00:19:12.125
And what if we look across all of scripture, we see time

387
00:19:12.305 --> 00:19:14.845
and time and time again that God always

388
00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.965
delivers on his promises.

389
00:19:16.965 --> 00:19:18.605
And that's exactly what he does here.

390
00:19:19.065 --> 00:19:24.005
See it in verse five, says in David and his men went to Kela

391
00:19:24.345 --> 00:19:25.885
and fought with the Philistines

392
00:19:25.945 --> 00:19:27.405
and brought away their livestock

393
00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:29.325
and struck them with a great blow.

394
00:19:30.065 --> 00:19:33.525
So David saved the inhabitants of Kela.

395
00:19:34.045 --> 00:19:36.925
I mean, how great is that ending to this episode? Right?

396
00:19:37.575 --> 00:19:39.405
David inquires of the Lord.

397
00:19:40.785 --> 00:19:42.485
He waits and he listens for

398
00:19:42.485 --> 00:19:44.245
what God will will instruct him to do.

399
00:19:45.745 --> 00:19:48.845
And then he acts upon what God tells him to do and

400
00:19:48.845 --> 00:19:51.685
because of his willingness to submit to God's will,

401
00:19:52.115 --> 00:19:54.885
what a victory that God brings for his people.

402
00:19:58.035 --> 00:20:00.205
This brings us to the second principle I want us

403
00:20:00.205 --> 00:20:02.925
to learn this morning, that

404
00:20:02.945 --> 00:20:05.325
to walk in God's will, we must seek him.

405
00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:08.565
Yes, but then we must also be willing to listen

406
00:20:09.065 --> 00:20:11.885
to his revealed truth as he gives it to us.

407
00:20:14.045 --> 00:20:17.255
This is why we find that phrase He who has ears to hear,

408
00:20:17.475 --> 00:20:20.975
let him hear written all over the scriptures

409
00:20:20.975 --> 00:20:23.655
because God does reveal himself

410
00:20:24.715 --> 00:20:27.415
and God does reveal his will to his people.

411
00:20:28.635 --> 00:20:31.775
Now, we may not be privy to every part of God's will,

412
00:20:32.475 --> 00:20:35.255
and we're absolutely not going to understand every part

413
00:20:35.255 --> 00:20:37.495
of the will that he does reveal to us.

414
00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:41.855
Paul himself wonders over this in Romans 11.

415
00:20:41.955 --> 00:20:45.575
He says, oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom

416
00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:50.565
and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his ways?

417
00:20:50.825 --> 00:20:51.965
How inscrutable

418
00:20:52.625 --> 00:20:55.565
or how sorry, how unsearchable are his judgments?

419
00:20:55.585 --> 00:20:57.285
How inscrutable his ways.

420
00:20:59.435 --> 00:21:03.135
Yet God clearly has revealed much of his will to us

421
00:21:03.135 --> 00:21:05.695
through his word written in the Bible

422
00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:09.895
and through his word, lived out in the flesh in Jesus.

423
00:21:11.275 --> 00:21:14.655
You see, the beginning of knowing God's will is to know him,

424
00:21:15.515 --> 00:21:18.015
to know who he has revealed himself to be.

425
00:21:19.155 --> 00:21:21.935
And we know this to be true, that to really know the will

426
00:21:21.935 --> 00:21:26.245
of anyone, you must know that person the way

427
00:21:26.245 --> 00:21:29.565
that they think, their patterns, their consistent character.

428
00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:33.055
And I'll give you an example of that.

429
00:21:33.075 --> 00:21:35.495
So there are two types of people when it comes

430
00:21:35.495 --> 00:21:37.375
to getting back from a vacation.

431
00:21:38.595 --> 00:21:40.415
On the one hand you have the type

432
00:21:40.415 --> 00:21:43.455
that you been a long trip home, you're tired,

433
00:21:44.075 --> 00:21:46.855
you bring all the bags in from the car, you go

434
00:21:46.855 --> 00:21:48.055
to the laundry room and you just

435
00:21:48.055 --> 00:21:49.095
drop 'em in the laundry room.

436
00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:52.375
And then what do you do? You go to bed, right?

437
00:21:52.375 --> 00:21:53.735
You wait to tackle that in the morning.

438
00:21:55.765 --> 00:21:57.745
And then there's my beautiful wife, Mara.

439
00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:03.265
See, we love to road trip as a family

440
00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:04.545
to the beaches in Florida.

441
00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:07.585
And on the last day of that trip,

442
00:22:07.955 --> 00:22:11.265
we'll get up early like 5:00 AM we'll pack up the car

443
00:22:11.845 --> 00:22:14.345
and we'll drive for the 16 hours all

444
00:22:14.345 --> 00:22:15.425
the way back to Oklahoma.

445
00:22:16.215 --> 00:22:17.305
It's late. We're tired.

446
00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:22.185
And in that moment, what do you think my will is?

447
00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:25.055
Oh, I'm ready. Yeah, I'm the first type.

448
00:22:25.075 --> 00:22:27.415
I'm ready to go to bed. But

449
00:22:27.415 --> 00:22:29.295
what do you think Mara's will is in that moment?

450
00:22:30.555 --> 00:22:33.335
It does not matter how late it is

451
00:22:33.475 --> 00:22:36.975
or how tired she is, she is not going to rest

452
00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:38.415
until every sock

453
00:22:38.555 --> 00:22:41.735
and toothbrush has been put back in its rightful place.

454
00:22:42.435 --> 00:22:45.455
And even the luggage itself has been tucked away into bed

455
00:22:45.875 --> 00:22:46.935
for sweet slumber.

456
00:22:48.155 --> 00:22:50.375
And you see, even though

457
00:22:51.315 --> 00:22:53.815
Mara's will is polar opposite from mine,

458
00:22:54.795 --> 00:22:56.095
I'm able to know her will.

459
00:22:56.395 --> 00:22:59.135
I'm able to understand it kind of,

460
00:23:00.755 --> 00:23:05.335
and I'm able to step into it because I know her, I love her

461
00:23:05.335 --> 00:23:06.495
and I want to honor her.

462
00:23:07.585 --> 00:23:10.365
And to be honest, what I found out in marriage is her will

463
00:23:10.465 --> 00:23:12.365
is usually better than mine is.

464
00:23:12.985 --> 00:23:17.845
But so it is with knowing God's will we begin

465
00:23:17.925 --> 00:23:22.405
by waking up to this fact that he has spoken his will

466
00:23:23.185 --> 00:23:26.405
in many ways over millennia, over thousands of years,

467
00:23:26.545 --> 00:23:30.645
he has revealed who he is to his people, how he thinks,

468
00:23:31.105 --> 00:23:33.565
his patterns, his consistent character.

469
00:23:34.885 --> 00:23:38.655
Hebrews one instructs us that long ago at many times,

470
00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:42.735
and in many ways God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,

471
00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:46.765
but in these days he has spoken to us by his son.

472
00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:51.415
So the question then is, are we willing

473
00:23:51.955 --> 00:23:53.295
to listen to his word?

474
00:23:54.155 --> 00:23:55.655
Are we willing to listen

475
00:23:55.715 --> 00:23:58.135
to his revealed will in the scriptures

476
00:23:58.275 --> 00:23:59.815
and in the life of Jesus?

477
00:24:01.435 --> 00:24:03.775
And are we then willing to step into

478
00:24:03.895 --> 00:24:06.855
that will even when it's opposed to our own will?

479
00:24:09.185 --> 00:24:11.165
And with that question that brings us now

480
00:24:11.225 --> 00:24:13.765
to look at Saul's delusion.

481
00:24:14.905 --> 00:24:17.245
So let's pick back up in first Samuel 23.

482
00:24:18.085 --> 00:24:22.325
Starting back in verse six says, when a BFR, the son

483
00:24:22.325 --> 00:24:26.605
of a Himalaya had fled to David tequila, he had come down

484
00:24:26.605 --> 00:24:28.045
with an EOD in his hand.

485
00:24:28.145 --> 00:24:29.485
Now we'll get back to that in a second.

486
00:24:30.505 --> 00:24:33.405
Now, I was told Saul that David had come tequila

487
00:24:34.065 --> 00:24:38.325
and Saul said, get this, God has given him into my hand

488
00:24:39.225 --> 00:24:41.965
for he has shut himself in by entering a town

489
00:24:41.965 --> 00:24:43.765
that has gates and bars.

490
00:24:45.185 --> 00:24:49.085
And Saul summoned all the people to war to go down tequila

491
00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:52.565
to besiege David and his men.

492
00:24:53.945 --> 00:24:57.445
So let's stop there. Did you happen to notice the condition

493
00:24:57.445 --> 00:24:59.565
of Saul's heart right here?

494
00:25:00.945 --> 00:25:04.725
He is utterly delusional in his perception of reality.

495
00:25:05.785 --> 00:25:07.685
He hears that David is in Kela

496
00:25:08.305 --> 00:25:10.405
and David's there fighting against the Philistines

497
00:25:10.405 --> 00:25:11.605
that he should be fighting against.

498
00:25:12.945 --> 00:25:16.885
And yet somehow he thinks that God is giving David over

499
00:25:16.905 --> 00:25:21.005
to him into his hand for Saul to kill him, to murder him.

500
00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:24.045
I mean, we read stories like this

501
00:25:24.145 --> 00:25:27.605
and we just wanna think like Saul, wake up man.

502
00:25:29.965 --> 00:25:33.345
But let this remind us that we are all equally capable

503
00:25:33.525 --> 00:25:36.345
of falling into such delusions if we're not rooted in

504
00:25:36.345 --> 00:25:38.935
Christ, if we are not

505
00:25:39.025 --> 00:25:41.615
after God's own heart.

506
00:25:43.605 --> 00:25:47.205
Jeremiah 17, nine declares that the heart is deceitful

507
00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:50.405
above all things and it is desperately sick

508
00:25:51.105 --> 00:25:52.125
who can understand it?

509
00:25:52.745 --> 00:25:55.285
We don't even understand our own hearts most of the time.

510
00:25:56.355 --> 00:25:58.085
This is why it's imperative

511
00:25:58.475 --> 00:26:00.845
that we take every thought captive

512
00:26:01.265 --> 00:26:04.085
and that we test every motivation of our hearts.

513
00:26:04.715 --> 00:26:05.925
This is why it's critical

514
00:26:05.925 --> 00:26:08.965
that we pray prayers like David does in Psalm 1 39,

515
00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:13.365
and we say, search me, oh God, know my heart.

516
00:26:14.585 --> 00:26:17.365
Try me and know my thoughts Lord,

517
00:26:17.465 --> 00:26:19.165
see if there'd be any grievous in way,

518
00:26:19.165 --> 00:26:22.045
and then God lead me in the way of everlasting.

519
00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:27.445
See, Saul's heart was so deceived by his selfish ambition

520
00:26:27.835 --> 00:26:30.205
that he projected his own will onto Gods,

521
00:26:31.195 --> 00:26:33.845
even though God had made it abundantly clear

522
00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:37.045
that his will was for Saul to no longer be king.

523
00:26:37.795 --> 00:26:39.325
Saul rejects God's will

524
00:26:39.865 --> 00:26:42.005
and rather makes up this false reality

525
00:26:42.425 --> 00:26:43.685
to support what he wants.

526
00:26:45.495 --> 00:26:47.475
And notice the contrast that we see here

527
00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:49.315
between Saul and David.

528
00:26:50.215 --> 00:26:52.715
You see Saul when he's with presented

529
00:26:52.715 --> 00:26:54.635
with information about Keah, what does he do?

530
00:26:55.735 --> 00:26:57.915
He just assumes that he knows God's will

531
00:26:57.915 --> 00:26:59.835
and then acts according to what he feels is best.

532
00:27:01.455 --> 00:27:03.195
But when David is presented

533
00:27:03.195 --> 00:27:05.075
with information about Keah, what does he do?

534
00:27:05.705 --> 00:27:08.835
Yeah, we saw it twice. He inquires of the Lord.

535
00:27:10.085 --> 00:27:11.865
See, while David was seeking

536
00:27:11.865 --> 00:27:15.465
after the kingdom of God, Saul was seeking

537
00:27:15.465 --> 00:27:17.425
after his own kingdom, Saul's kingdom.

538
00:27:19.085 --> 00:27:21.825
So likewise, our third principle is this.

539
00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:25.785
If we are to walk in God's will, we must be willing

540
00:27:25.785 --> 00:27:28.145
to surrender our own kingdoms.

541
00:27:28.245 --> 00:27:32.425
As we look to abide in his brothers

542
00:27:32.425 --> 00:27:36.265
and sisters, let us be a people who seek first the kingdom

543
00:27:36.285 --> 00:27:40.905
of God who submit to his lordship over our lives

544
00:27:42.365 --> 00:27:46.185
and then who abide, who live in the peace of his provision

545
00:27:46.445 --> 00:27:47.545
and his judgments.

546
00:27:49.065 --> 00:27:52.805
So as we pick back up in verse nine, we'll continue to see

547
00:27:52.805 --> 00:27:55.605
how how David's submission to God's kingdom

548
00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:57.285
continues to play itself out.

549
00:27:58.185 --> 00:27:59.485
So look with me at verse nine.

550
00:27:59.485 --> 00:28:03.205
It says, David knew that Saul was plotting harm against him,

551
00:28:03.945 --> 00:28:08.125
and he said to a BFR of the priest, bring the EOD here.

552
00:28:08.985 --> 00:28:11.085
All right, so what is the deal with the eod?

553
00:28:11.175 --> 00:28:13.205
We've seen it mentioned twice here now, right?

554
00:28:14.425 --> 00:28:16.965
So the EO would've been this garment

555
00:28:17.005 --> 00:28:19.365
that the high priest wore covering his torso

556
00:28:20.385 --> 00:28:22.245
and attached to the EOD would've been

557
00:28:22.245 --> 00:28:25.765
what was called the breast piece of judgment or decision.

558
00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:29.125
And in that breast piece would've been contained

559
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:31.125
what was called the Uum and the tum.

560
00:28:31.585 --> 00:28:33.445
So what were the Uum and the tum

561
00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:36.565
besides some fun words to say, well,

562
00:28:36.565 --> 00:28:37.965
we don't really know exactly.

563
00:28:38.115 --> 00:28:41.125
Most scholars believe that these were probably two stones,

564
00:28:41.285 --> 00:28:43.005
a white stone and a dark stone

565
00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:47.205
that the priest would use in discerning god's will.

566
00:28:47.385 --> 00:28:49.485
So basically it would look like this.

567
00:28:49.485 --> 00:28:51.925
They would ask a question of the Lord, a yes

568
00:28:51.925 --> 00:28:55.165
or no question, then they would reach into the breast piece

569
00:28:55.225 --> 00:28:57.685
and pull out one of these two stones.

570
00:28:57.705 --> 00:29:00.325
If it was a white one, the answer is yes.

571
00:29:00.425 --> 00:29:02.325
If it's a black one, the answer is no.

572
00:29:03.625 --> 00:29:07.565
Now, this might seem like the priests were just relying on

573
00:29:07.615 --> 00:29:10.245
blind chance to discern God's will and make a decision.

574
00:29:11.025 --> 00:29:13.725
But scripture tells us this is clearly one of the ways

575
00:29:13.725 --> 00:29:16.165
that God had instructed his people at the time

576
00:29:16.625 --> 00:29:18.085
to seek out God's will

577
00:29:18.385 --> 00:29:20.205
and to listen to what he wanted them to do.

578
00:29:22.595 --> 00:29:24.975
And think about this, the fact that God worked

579
00:29:24.975 --> 00:29:26.855
through something as seemingly random

580
00:29:28.075 --> 00:29:30.815
as this should only elevate our perspective

581
00:29:30.815 --> 00:29:32.455
of God's sovereignty.

582
00:29:32.655 --> 00:29:37.055
I mean, this blows my mind that everything, even

583
00:29:37.085 --> 00:29:39.135
what seems like pure chance to us,

584
00:29:39.135 --> 00:29:40.535
like basically flipping a coin

585
00:29:42.305 --> 00:29:45.565
are within his complete divine knowledge and control.

586
00:29:46.475 --> 00:29:50.045
Doesn't that blow your mind of how God can get his outcomes

587
00:29:50.465 --> 00:29:52.365
of his will out of something like that?

588
00:29:53.805 --> 00:29:56.705
And let this also be a comfort to you if you find yourself

589
00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:59.585
paralyzed in trying to discern God's will

590
00:29:59.585 --> 00:30:01.225
because you don't wanna mess up his plans.

591
00:30:02.975 --> 00:30:07.005
Trust me, even if you wanted to, you don't have the power

592
00:30:07.145 --> 00:30:08.405
to disrupt God's will.

593
00:30:09.495 --> 00:30:13.245
There is nothing that you can do that can thwart God's plans

594
00:30:13.305 --> 00:30:14.925
or upend his sovereign decree.

595
00:30:16.145 --> 00:30:19.965
If it is God's will, it's going to happen period.

596
00:30:21.145 --> 00:30:24.045
And if you need proof of this, just look at the empty tomb

597
00:30:25.195 --> 00:30:29.845
because in man's best attempt to stop the reign

598
00:30:29.845 --> 00:30:32.805
of Jesus and literally kill God's will,

599
00:30:32.805 --> 00:30:34.325
they crucified him on a cross.

600
00:30:35.915 --> 00:30:37.655
But Sunday came, didn't it?

601
00:30:38.595 --> 00:30:40.495
And with it, the resurrection

602
00:30:40.915 --> 00:30:42.895
and glorious display of Christ Jesus,

603
00:30:42.995 --> 00:30:46.495
our Lord's sovereign victory over sin and death

604
00:30:46.875 --> 00:30:49.775
and any force that could possibly stand in

605
00:30:49.775 --> 00:30:50.815
his way of reigning.

606
00:30:51.715 --> 00:30:55.735
So believe me, if he can overcome that, there is no decision

607
00:30:55.735 --> 00:30:58.895
that you or I can make that will stand in his way

608
00:30:58.895 --> 00:31:00.015
of doing what he wants.

609
00:31:02.405 --> 00:31:06.625
So David calls on a BSR of the priest to bring the ephod

610
00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:09.305
to him because he wants to seek out God's will

611
00:31:09.815 --> 00:31:11.265
when he hears of Saul's threats.

612
00:31:12.165 --> 00:31:14.465
And he cries out in verse 10, look with me there.

613
00:31:15.925 --> 00:31:18.745
He says, oh Lord, the God of Israel,

614
00:31:19.615 --> 00:31:22.465
your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come

615
00:31:22.465 --> 00:31:25.465
to Keah to destroy the city on my account.

616
00:31:26.535 --> 00:31:29.185
Will the men of keah surrender me into his hand?

617
00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:34.465
Will Saul come down as your servant has heard, oh Lord,

618
00:31:34.605 --> 00:31:37.425
the God of Israel, please tell your servant.

619
00:31:38.565 --> 00:31:41.225
And the Lord said he will come down.

620
00:31:42.295 --> 00:31:44.785
Then David said, will the men of keyless surrender me

621
00:31:44.785 --> 00:31:46.745
and my men into the hand of Saul?

622
00:31:47.045 --> 00:31:49.705
And the Lord said, they will surrender you.

623
00:31:51.125 --> 00:31:54.655
Then David and his men who are about 600 arose

624
00:31:54.795 --> 00:31:58.175
and departed from Keah and they went wherever they could go.

625
00:31:59.365 --> 00:32:02.255
When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keah,

626
00:32:02.475 --> 00:32:03.775
he gave up the expedition

627
00:32:05.035 --> 00:32:07.855
and David remained in the strongholds and the wilderness

628
00:32:08.195 --> 00:32:11.335
and the hill country of the wilderness of Ziff.

629
00:32:11.355 --> 00:32:13.375
And Saul sought him every day,

630
00:32:13.875 --> 00:32:16.695
but God did not give him into his hand.

631
00:32:18.775 --> 00:32:21.695
I want us to notice here the posture of David

632
00:32:21.755 --> 00:32:24.895
before Yahweh, the Lord, especially in comparison

633
00:32:25.195 --> 00:32:26.575
to the arrogance that we just saw.

634
00:32:26.595 --> 00:32:31.255
And Saul David three times here refers

635
00:32:31.255 --> 00:32:35.295
to himself as God's servant taking on the posture

636
00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:39.485
of submission to the one true king Yahweh,

637
00:32:39.585 --> 00:32:40.645
the God of Israel.

638
00:32:41.665 --> 00:32:44.165
So when hearing that Saul was coming down

639
00:32:44.165 --> 00:32:47.045
to do battle against him, so David could have had any number

640
00:32:47.045 --> 00:32:49.925
of knee-jerk reactions, he could have been fearful

641
00:32:50.585 --> 00:32:53.005
and tried to convince the people of Keah to hide him

642
00:32:53.005 --> 00:32:54.205
or protect him from Saul.

643
00:32:56.535 --> 00:32:58.075
On the other hand, he could have been angry

644
00:32:58.455 --> 00:33:00.275
or obstinate and decided, you know what?

645
00:33:00.335 --> 00:33:01.715
No, I'm gonna stand my ground

646
00:33:01.715 --> 00:33:03.435
and I'm not gonna, I'm gonna fight Saul

647
00:33:03.735 --> 00:33:04.755
and I'm gonna, I'm going

648
00:33:04.755 --> 00:33:07.155
to defeat him like I just did the Philistines.

649
00:33:08.755 --> 00:33:12.895
But no, it is with a servant mindset that he again,

650
00:33:13.185 --> 00:33:15.975
seeks out the Lord's guidance realizing

651
00:33:15.975 --> 00:33:17.935
that it was ultimately God's kingdom

652
00:33:18.285 --> 00:33:20.615
that was being established, not David's.

653
00:33:22.195 --> 00:33:23.415
So God answers him

654
00:33:23.715 --> 00:33:26.295
and reveals that Saul is indeed coming down.

655
00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:31.145
And he also reveals that the people of Keah whom David

656
00:33:31.245 --> 00:33:33.465
and his men had just saved by the way,

657
00:33:34.555 --> 00:33:35.905
would indeed betray him

658
00:33:36.065 --> 00:33:39.665
and hand him over to be killed by Saul if he were to stay.

659
00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:44.465
Now, I don't wanna miss something really important here

660
00:33:44.465 --> 00:33:46.745
that we see about God and his omniscience.

661
00:33:47.245 --> 00:33:50.645
Did you catch this? There's this fact

662
00:33:50.645 --> 00:33:53.965
that God even knows the outcome of potential scenarios

663
00:33:54.235 --> 00:33:56.165
that never even come to pass.

664
00:33:57.265 --> 00:33:58.605
He knows that the inhabitants

665
00:33:58.605 --> 00:34:01.565
of Keah would have handed David over

666
00:34:01.905 --> 00:34:03.885
to Saul if he were to have stayed.

667
00:34:04.045 --> 00:34:08.765
I mean, how high above us is God's wisdom, his omniscience,

668
00:34:08.785 --> 00:34:12.245
his sovereign knowledge over all things, all circumstances,

669
00:34:12.795 --> 00:34:14.965
even those that don't ever happen.

670
00:34:17.405 --> 00:34:20.545
And this is where we get to witness God's deliverance.

671
00:34:21.405 --> 00:34:24.825
See, because God's word is trustworthy, David

672
00:34:24.965 --> 00:34:26.945
and his men are delivered from Saul once

673
00:34:26.955 --> 00:34:28.545
again by the hand of the Lord.

674
00:34:29.525 --> 00:34:31.595
And I want us to notice something really important

675
00:34:31.625 --> 00:34:34.075
here in this instance.

676
00:34:34.335 --> 00:34:37.155
God doesn't tell David exactly what he should do next.

677
00:34:38.255 --> 00:34:40.325
David seeks out wisdom from the Lord.

678
00:34:40.505 --> 00:34:43.445
Yes, but God doesn't tell him what his next steps should be.

679
00:34:44.535 --> 00:34:47.265
Instead he gives him insight, he gives him knowledge, yes.

680
00:34:48.005 --> 00:34:50.825
But then he lets David act according

681
00:34:50.845 --> 00:34:53.945
to his own judgment based on that information, based on

682
00:34:53.945 --> 00:34:55.385
what God has revealed to him.

683
00:34:56.955 --> 00:34:59.215
And as David trusts that God has for him

684
00:34:59.315 --> 00:35:01.335
and remembers that God has proven

685
00:35:01.435 --> 00:35:04.695
to deliver him from his enemies, he makes the decision

686
00:35:04.795 --> 00:35:06.175
to not fight against Saul,

687
00:35:06.915 --> 00:35:09.975
to not bring destruction on the city of Keah,

688
00:35:11.035 --> 00:35:14.535
but instead to depend upon God for deliverance

689
00:35:14.555 --> 00:35:16.175
as he escapes to the wilderness.

690
00:35:17.475 --> 00:35:19.775
So here we see our final principle that I want us

691
00:35:19.775 --> 00:35:23.215
to learn this morning, that to walk according to God's will,

692
00:35:23.795 --> 00:35:25.335
we should follow David's example

693
00:35:25.395 --> 00:35:29.055
and obey the will that God has revealed to us.

694
00:35:30.195 --> 00:35:33.415
And then we should trust him fully with the outcome.

695
00:35:36.305 --> 00:35:39.085
So what are we to do with this story?

696
00:35:39.425 --> 00:35:41.565
So we, yes, we've looked at these four principles

697
00:35:42.035 --> 00:35:44.725
that we should follow if we are to walk in God's will,

698
00:35:46.115 --> 00:35:47.815
but I admit there is a temptation

699
00:35:47.815 --> 00:35:50.015
for me when I read stories like this in the Bible

700
00:35:50.025 --> 00:35:54.295
where God clearly speaks his will of direction to someone

701
00:35:54.295 --> 00:35:55.695
that I begin to think, well,

702
00:35:56.275 --> 00:35:58.215
why doesn't God show up in my life that way?

703
00:35:58.845 --> 00:36:01.255
Perhaps if I just pray hard enough

704
00:36:01.755 --> 00:36:03.455
or if I look for the right signs,

705
00:36:03.555 --> 00:36:06.735
or if I interpret the stars right, then I'm gonna know

706
00:36:06.735 --> 00:36:08.055
what God's will is for me.

707
00:36:09.415 --> 00:36:12.995
And while I will say yes, God does work in

708
00:36:12.995 --> 00:36:15.795
that way at times when he deems it necessary.

709
00:36:16.765 --> 00:36:19.555
Let's not forget the central plot line

710
00:36:19.555 --> 00:36:21.715
of which this story sits in one Samuel.

711
00:36:22.625 --> 00:36:25.435
This whole account of of one Samuel

712
00:36:26.055 --> 00:36:29.875
is about God bringing about his will to raise up David and

713
00:36:30.095 --> 00:36:33.075
and establish him as the king of Israel.

714
00:36:34.095 --> 00:36:36.355
Yes, for the good of pe of the good of the people

715
00:36:36.355 --> 00:36:38.715
of Israel at the time, but ultimately

716
00:36:39.215 --> 00:36:42.035
to establish the messianic line by which Jesus

717
00:36:42.685 --> 00:36:45.875
would eventually come centuries later to inherit the throne.

718
00:36:47.575 --> 00:36:49.515
So we shouldn't be surprised at all

719
00:36:49.655 --> 00:36:54.395
to see God working in some pretty remarkable overt ways here

720
00:36:54.455 --> 00:36:57.275
to make sure that that mission comes to pass, right?

721
00:36:59.535 --> 00:37:02.875
So while we wish that we could have a priest

722
00:37:02.935 --> 00:37:05.395
and an eod, a Euro and a humum,

723
00:37:05.895 --> 00:37:09.595
or at bare minimum, a divine magic eight ball

724
00:37:09.775 --> 00:37:12.355
to give us direction to our decisions

725
00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:15.595
or our dilemmas, let me challenge you to believe

726
00:37:15.595 --> 00:37:19.875
that those things were just shadows of the better access

727
00:37:19.875 --> 00:37:23.395
that we have to God now, the better access that we have

728
00:37:23.395 --> 00:37:26.035
to God's will today, you see,

729
00:37:26.035 --> 00:37:30.985
because God did carry out his will for Jesus, the Messiah

730
00:37:30.985 --> 00:37:32.425
to come through the line of David.

731
00:37:33.365 --> 00:37:36.745
And because Jesus in perfect submission to the Father's,

732
00:37:36.745 --> 00:37:39.385
will left heaven to come

733
00:37:39.485 --> 00:37:42.425
and save a people who also would betray him,

734
00:37:44.045 --> 00:37:47.665
we now have a great high priest in Jesus

735
00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:49.705
who is seated at the right hand

736
00:37:50.085 --> 00:37:51.985
of the majesty of throne in heaven.

737
00:37:53.775 --> 00:37:55.875
And he's interceding on our behalf forever.

738
00:37:57.335 --> 00:38:00.755
And by his spirit whom he sent, which indwells us,

739
00:38:00.975 --> 00:38:04.955
we have now been given direct access to God who guides us

740
00:38:05.055 --> 00:38:06.675
and leads us into all truth.

741
00:38:08.325 --> 00:38:11.705
And finally, we have something that David didn't have.

742
00:38:11.805 --> 00:38:16.105
We have the entirety of God's written word at our fingertips

743
00:38:17.215 --> 00:38:21.275
and in it the beautiful treasure of God's redemptive plan

744
00:38:21.455 --> 00:38:24.485
for humanity and who he is

745
00:38:25.185 --> 00:38:26.605
and what he wants for us.

746
00:38:28.655 --> 00:38:31.315
So believer, I'll leave you with this.

747
00:38:32.825 --> 00:38:36.725
Inquire of the Lord, seek him

748
00:38:36.945 --> 00:38:40.005
and His will listen

749
00:38:40.185 --> 00:38:41.965
and obey to what He commands.

750
00:38:44.025 --> 00:38:47.245
And then let's trust him as we wait

751
00:38:47.265 --> 00:38:48.605
to see what he will do next.

752
00:38:51.625 --> 00:38:53.885
And to that end, will you pray with me?

753
00:38:56.225 --> 00:38:58.805
Father, we do seek you this morning,

754
00:39:01.475 --> 00:39:04.245
Lord, we do admit that your will, your ways are

755
00:39:04.245 --> 00:39:05.445
so much higher than ours.

756
00:39:08.185 --> 00:39:11.405
God, give us hearts that are submitted to your kingdom.

757
00:39:11.665 --> 00:39:15.285
God, we lay down our own kingdoms, our own wills,

758
00:39:15.305 --> 00:39:16.805
our own selfish ambitions.

759
00:39:17.425 --> 00:39:18.805
We lay it at the foot of the cross

760
00:39:18.825 --> 00:39:21.205
and say, God, do with us what you will.

761
00:39:22.155 --> 00:39:24.445
This people that you've purchased by your blood

762
00:39:25.825 --> 00:39:28.285
for yourself, God, do with us what you will.

763
00:39:28.615 --> 00:39:32.925
We're submitted to you. Reveal yourself to us

764
00:39:32.925 --> 00:39:35.525
through your word, through your son Jesus.

765
00:39:35.865 --> 00:39:37.605
And let us step into that will God.

766
00:39:40.345 --> 00:39:41.965
We love you. We depend upon you,

767
00:39:41.985 --> 00:39:43.965
and we wait for what you will do next.

768
00:39:47.105 --> 00:39:49.045
So as we get ready to sing this next song,

769
00:39:49.285 --> 00:39:50.405
I would encourage you just

770
00:39:50.405 --> 00:39:52.325
to take a few more moments and sit there.

771
00:39:54.305 --> 00:39:56.085
The worship team is gonna come back up

772
00:39:56.085 --> 00:40:00.445
and we're gonna sing this song together, but sit there

773
00:40:00.445 --> 00:40:03.605
and consider what it means to live within God's will.

774
00:40:04.755 --> 00:40:06.965
Seek him out, inquire of him,

775
00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:11.405
and then see what he will do as we wait for him.

776
00:40:12.335 --> 00:40:14.885
Let's worship together as we wrap up this morning.
