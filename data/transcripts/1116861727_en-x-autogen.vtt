WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.965
Uh, I'll sing those first on your lyric sheet

2
00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:04.205
says four lines there.

3
00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:05.845
Um, I'll do those twice

4
00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:09.045
and then actually I'm gonna walk us through it.

5
00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:13.565
Uh, so the second time through will be,

6
00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:16.245
I'm calling on the God

7
00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:24.005
a shepherd Boy.

8
00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:29.765
Courageous. I may not

9
00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:34.165
face, but I've gotten my own.

10
00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:43.205
Oh God, my God. I need you. Oh God. So

11
00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:45.685
Just give a little space there, um, afterwards.

12
00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:50.365
Um, and then once we get to Sothebys,

13
00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:52.445
down chorus twice through there.

14
00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:57.485
And then, uh, we'll just go to

15
00:00:57.485 --> 00:00:59.245
that instrumental before the bridges.

16
00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:01.405
And then from that point on, the rest

17
00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:04.085
of the song is exactly the same, like the recording un up

18
00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:07.165
until there was a six minute mark on the recording.

19
00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:11.245
But, um, basically it gets us into doing that chorus twice

20
00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:13.805
and instrumentals, um, out.

21
00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.965
Where do you want us to come in with you?

22
00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:23.505
Uh, I think it would be good to come in

23
00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:24.745
after the Bridges are going.

24
00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:27.625
Um, I'm, I'm gonna do my best to try to get them to,

25
00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:29.785
they know the song, so I'm gonna get 'em to sing it.

26
00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:31.985
Um, so I might back off a little bit.

27
00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:37.425
So I think the should start coming in on, uh,

28
00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:41.485
maybe after the instrumental, just

29
00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:42.765
so it leaves a lot of space there.

30
00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:45.565
Is that cool? After the instrumental

31
00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:50.305
after the chorus is twice before the Bridges correct.

32
00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:57.185
Don't want guide? No, it's just an intro guy

33
00:01:57.475 --> 00:02:02.125
Who's the Guy Intro.

34
00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:06.985
Yeah. Yeah. Do you want the count?

35
00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:12.735
It'll help. Yeah.

36
00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:15.655
If you don't want the guy wanna count,

37
00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:20.135
It won't, I don't think it'll matter.

38
00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:25.055
Yeah. Uh,

39
00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:25.495
so

40
00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:32.235
we are That's correct.

41
00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:37.465
Um, yeah,

42
00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:39.665
so the instrumental is four times.

43
00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:43.465
We're not going to bridge four. Just know that coming.

44
00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:45.785
Oh, we will kind of come back out of that.

45
00:02:46.585 --> 00:02:49.625
I will probably do another chorus there.

46
00:02:52.225 --> 00:02:55.315
Yeah. You freed your, freed the captives then part. Yeah.

47
00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.275
And we'll be back down.

48
00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:01.325
Um, I think it'd be really helpful to get to

49
00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:02.365
that progression.

50
00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:06.565
Uh, bridge

51
00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:08.645
of it was like the Lord.

52
00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:11.705
So we're ringing out,

53
00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:22.225
Uh, Uh, let's give this a try.

54
00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:25.145
I know there's a lot here. Uh, we got this.

55
00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:26.785
We'll work through some kinks

56
00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:27.905
as along the way if we need to.

57
00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:30.735
What's

58
00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:44.645
So we're playing through this as Lord supper's being passed,

59
00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:46.365
taking all those things.

60
00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:48.125
So we'll be in this intro for a while.

61
00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:51.165
It'll be easy just to jump in when we need to

62
00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:30.725
Of God

63
00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:35.685

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:36.245

I'm standing on your faithfulness

100
00:13:45.355 --> 00:13:46.575
on your faith.

101
00:13:56.475 --> 00:13:58.535
Say, let's stay on the wand there. Yeah.

102
00:14:04.075 --> 00:14:04.895
You went to the what?

103
00:14:05.495 --> 00:14:06.495
I went To the

104
00:14:07.135 --> 00:14:08.135
Oh you did. Okay.

105
00:14:08.135 --> 00:14:08.935
Sorry.

106
00:14:09.055 --> 00:14:12.455
I missed, I I'm had of trouble hearing the one over three.

107
00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:14.575
That was it, where it started.

108
00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:20.445
I think it would be Okay. One over three.

109
00:14:22.045 --> 00:14:24.265
You are the one you king

110
00:14:25.695 --> 00:14:27.665
Lord over everything.

111
00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:32.705
Jesus. There is no other Jesus.

112
00:14:33.195 --> 00:14:37.985
There is no other will never change.

113
00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:43.145
Your name is here to Jesus.

114
00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:47.585
There is there?

115
00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:56.285
Yeah. That's great. Yeah.

116
00:15:00.675 --> 00:15:04.965
Cool. Uh, any thoughts throughout that?

117
00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:06.825
Yes.

118
00:15:39.715 --> 00:15:43.365
Yeah. Yeah.

119
00:15:43.365 --> 00:15:45.845
I would say vocal is coming in as much as you want

120
00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:47.205
to on these songs for sure.

121
00:15:47.825 --> 00:15:50.415
Um, there's a little bit of a pace on

122
00:15:50.415 --> 00:15:51.895
that verse four on saying, God,

123
00:15:51.895 --> 00:15:54.455
that might feel a little weird with everybody in,

124
00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:58.495
but I think we could, everything else let's sing.

125
00:16:00.485 --> 00:16:01.025
That's good.

126
00:16:11.735 --> 00:16:13.115
Yep. Yeah. As

127
00:16:19.615 --> 00:16:22.015
we were going through that, I have a little bit of a plan

128
00:16:22.635 --> 00:16:25.225
to prompt them to do something and not just listen to us.

129
00:16:34.965 --> 00:16:38.255
I do have an idea though, like an intentional idea.

130
00:16:39.075 --> 00:16:42.155
So, but no good.

131
00:16:42.275 --> 00:16:43.675
I I definitely don't want the moment

132
00:16:43.675 --> 00:16:45.635
of just them standing there watching those instruments.

133
00:16:45.635 --> 00:16:50.545
We so Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna try to keep them there.

134
00:16:51.275 --> 00:16:53.715
That's good. Okay.

135
00:16:58.005 --> 00:17:02.835
Ah, please do. Um, do we wanna run it again?

136
00:17:02.935 --> 00:17:06.315
Uh, structurally I felt it felt pretty comfortable that run

137
00:17:06.315 --> 00:17:10.145
through, but do we want to run anything again through that?

138
00:17:16.115 --> 00:17:16.405
Yeah.

139
00:17:21.115 --> 00:17:22.165
Cool. Yeah, we can do that.

140
00:17:24.145 --> 00:17:28.365
So, who's like the Lord we're gonna do?

141
00:17:28.365 --> 00:17:32.715
Who is like the Lord? Um, just to get some there.

142
00:17:33.505 --> 00:17:33.725
Yep.

143
00:17:38.855 --> 00:17:43.775
Uh, verse four. So I'm

144
00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:45.575
calling on the God of Jake David, sorry.

145
00:17:45.995 --> 00:17:47.935
Who made us shepherd boy courageous.

146
00:17:48.275 --> 00:17:50.005
I'm gonna sing that two times

147
00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:53.565
and then I may not face Goliath, but I've got my own giants.

148
00:17:53.735 --> 00:17:58.705
Small little pause chorus twice right there. Yep.

149
00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:02.105
And then bridge one, bridge two.

150
00:18:02.205 --> 00:18:07.145
Bridge three holds back into chorus twice.

151
00:18:07.765 --> 00:18:07.985
Yep.

152
00:18:12.995 --> 00:18:14.965
Then it is, uh, well this, yeah,

153
00:18:14.985 --> 00:18:17.275

And then, uh, then we'll be in lose like the Lord. Bridge

00:19:35.985 --> 00:19:36.965
The darkest

156
00:19:41.025 --> 00:19:44.725
who can break the curse generations.

157
00:19:45.945 --> 00:19:46.165

Oh, uh, let's,

232
00:54:33.575 --> 00:54:37.805
I guess this is trial and error.

233
00:58:35.035 --> 00:58:36.765
Welcome to Henderson Hills.

234
00:58:39.265 --> 00:58:42.725
We are disciple makers anchored in truth, compelled by love

235
00:58:42.905 --> 00:58:44.805
and desperately dependent on the Lord.

236
00:58:46.745 --> 00:58:48.605
We are generous with what God has given us

237
00:58:48.985 --> 00:58:51.205
and we share life giving help with those around us.

238
00:58:53.665 --> 00:58:56.365
Our mission is to equip one another to love Jesus.

239
00:58:56.585 --> 00:58:58.845
And lip syn, we are glad you're here,

240

and I'm glad that you are here.

244
00:59:21.185 --> 00:59:24.485
Um, one thing that I wanna make sure that you, um,

245
00:59:24.735 --> 00:59:26.565
don't leave here without doing is at least getting

246
00:59:26.565 --> 00:59:28.565
to shake someone's hand and meet someone here.

247
00:59:28.985 --> 00:59:33.285
And a very easy way to do that is to go to our new here, uh,

248
00:59:33.515 --> 00:59:36.245
desk out at the lobby and meet someone out there.

249
00:59:36.245 --> 00:59:37.725
They'll be able to give you a little bit more information

250
00:59:37.725 --> 00:59:39.725
about who we are here at Henderson Hills.

251
00:59:40.185 --> 00:59:42.245
And if you have been coming here for some time,

252
00:59:42.775 --> 00:59:45.125
maybe you've been visiting for the last few weeks or months,

253
00:59:45.225 --> 00:59:47.085

254
00:59:47.085 --> 00:59:49.885

Uh, so if you'll, is it next week? I think it's next week.

260

We'd love for you to come be a part of that as well.

261
01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:11.845
So, uh, go ahead and dive into that and,

01:00:11.845 --> 01:00:13.845

264
01:00:16.665 --> 01:00:18.645
And then finally, if you are looking for a place

01:00:18.645 --> 01:00:21.285

266
01:00:21.465 --> 01:00:22.605
or you play an instrument,

267
01:00:23.065 --> 01:00:26.285
or you wanna learn how to be involved with running sound

268
01:00:26.345 --> 01:00:27.485
or lights or cameras.

269
01:00:27.555 --> 01:00:31.325
Here we are having a worship ministry interest lunch next

270
01:00:31.325 --> 01:00:32.845

271
01:00:32.985 --> 01:00:35.285

Uh, so come to that as well

273
01:00:37.405 --> 01:00:39.045
and get a little bit of information about what it means

274
01:00:39.045 --> 01:00:41.885
to serve in the worship ministry here at Henderson Hills.

275
01:00:41.945 --> 01:00:43.525
To do that, you can meet with some

276
01:00:43.525 --> 01:00:45.805

277
01:00:45.905 --> 01:00:47.645
and we'd love to give you some more information there.

278
01:00:48.465 --> 01:00:51.125
And then finally, uh, I would love to invite all of us

279
01:00:51.185 --> 01:00:54.965
to stand up and take some time to greet one another.

280
01:00:55.465 --> 01:00:57.525
Uh, get to know each other a little bit more.

281
01:00:58.185 --> 01:01:00.845
Um, come up with an icebreaker,

282
01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:17.405
Someone Chest bumps in here.

283
01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:23.795
We're doing something right. All right,

284
01:01:24.545 --> 01:01:27.275
well, let me invite you to make your way back to your seats

285
01:01:27.295 --> 01:01:30.075
and let's get involved in some time of worship this morning.

286
01:01:32.645 --> 01:01:34.595
We're gonna start this morning singing a new song,

287
01:01:34.595 --> 01:01:35.915
the wave it song here this morning,

288
01:01:36.975 --> 01:01:40.235
and to put ourselves in the right frame of reference, uh,

289
01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.355
for what we're singing in this song.

290
01:01:42.655 --> 01:01:45.435
I'd like to read from Psalm one 13 this morning.

291
01:01:48.265 --> 01:01:50.755
This is starting in verse five of Psalm one 13.

292
01:01:50.755 --> 01:01:54.875
He says, who is like the Lord our God who is seated on high,

293
01:01:55.775 --> 01:01:57.835
who looks far down on the heavens

294
01:01:57.855 --> 01:02:00.915
and the earth, he raises the poor from the dust

295
01:02:00.975 --> 01:02:04.635
and lifts the needy from the Ashe to make them sit

296
01:02:04.635 --> 01:02:07.835
with princes, with the princes of his people.

297
01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.675
He gives the barren woman a home,

298
01:02:10.815 --> 01:02:13.155
making her the joyous mother of children.

299
01:02:13.895 --> 01:02:15.155
Praise the Lord.

300
01:02:15.855 --> 01:02:17.355
And that's what I want us to do this morning

301
01:02:17.415 --> 01:02:21.445
as we reflect on who our God is, who Jesus is.

302
01:02:22.265 --> 01:02:25.405
And just ask that question, who is like the Lord?

303
01:02:25.465 --> 01:02:28.325
And as we, as we consider that, let's respond

304
01:02:28.705 --> 01:02:30.685
and praise this morning as we sing this song.

305
01:02:30.685 --> 01:02:32.125
So let's worship together this morning

306
01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:45.165
There before

307
01:02:51.385 --> 01:02:55.925
the stars and sun who

308
01:02:56.435 --> 01:02:56.725
said,

309
01:03:14.385 --> 01:03:16.805
who can make the darkest demon?

310
01:03:20.425 --> 01:03:21.045
Who can

311
01:04:10.855 --> 01:04:11.075
the,

312
01:05:08.415 --> 01:05:10.355
the Lord, everything.

313
01:05:11.525 --> 01:05:15.915
Jesus. There is no, Jesus there is

314
01:05:20.915 --> 01:05:21.915
Your name.

315
01:05:39.725 --> 01:05:40.725
A

316
01:07:08.695 --> 01:07:10.305
When I was lost,

317
01:07:12.935 --> 01:07:16.385
your presence was where I found home.

318
01:07:17.685 --> 01:07:17.905
You

319
01:07:25.445 --> 01:07:30.065

320
01:07:30.155 --> 01:07:32.785

321
01:09:06.005 --> 01:09:06.125
I,

322
01:09:22.565 --> 01:09:22.685

01:09:56.235 --> 01:10:01.175
You are strong and have witnessed it. Your content.

325
01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:02.655
I witnessed it

326
01:10:03.275 --> 01:10:06.895
and I'm confident I'll see it again.

327
01:10:07.395 --> 01:10:08.395
And,

328
01:10:53.575 --> 01:10:53.795
And

329
01:11:03.395 --> 01:11:03.515
I,

330
01:11:19.805 --> 01:11:19.925
I

331
01:12:24.525 --> 01:12:28.245
Faithful seen you breathe

332
01:12:37.225 --> 01:12:37.645
worthy.

333
01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:53.805
Pour my praise. You're worthy.

334
01:12:54.985 --> 01:12:58.245
God, you're worthy of all of it.

335
01:13:00.985 --> 01:13:02.485
God, we thank you that you are worthy.

336
01:13:02.585 --> 01:13:04.485
God, we thank you for all the things

337
01:13:04.485 --> 01:13:05.645
that you've done in our lives.

338
01:13:05.785 --> 01:13:08.165
God, may we be quick to proclaim those things.

339
01:13:08.665 --> 01:13:11.445
In your name we pray. Amen. You may be seated.

340
01:13:29.615 --> 01:13:31.595
That's it. Okay.

341
01:13:33.295 --> 01:13:35.515
Didn't feel like that was finished. Okay. Yeah.

342
01:13:35.515 --> 01:13:37.995
The court progression didn't finished. It was not Yeah.

343
01:13:38.975 --> 01:13:40.635
May tweak that for next week.

344
01:13:42.035 --> 01:13:43.235
'cause that's gonna make people like you.

345
01:13:43.505 --> 01:13:47.475
Like don't feel right. Resolve please.

346
01:13:47.775 --> 01:13:48.795
Um, okay.

347
01:13:49.735 --> 01:13:53.195
So I'm gonna preach for a while about David

348
01:13:54.815 --> 01:13:57.835
and the last point about him

349
01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:02.835
and Jesus fulfilling what David couldn't.

350
01:14:03.815 --> 01:14:05.235
And then talk about

351
01:14:07.565 --> 01:14:09.275
Jesus specifically.

352
01:14:09.315 --> 01:14:10.475
A couple things at the very end.

353
01:14:10.505 --> 01:14:13.005
Then I will pray, leave some prayer time there

354
01:14:13.865 --> 01:14:17.965
and then say, invite Chris back up to do the Lord's supper.

355
01:14:18.625 --> 01:14:20.965
So let's have Chris come.

356
01:14:24.305 --> 01:14:26.005
So we're going to enter a time of, um,

357
01:14:26.765 --> 01:14:27.925
participating in the Lord's Supper

358
01:14:29.145 --> 01:14:31.165
and I'll explain a little bit of what that is.

359
01:14:31.785 --> 01:14:36.605
Um, and I'll also explain that, um, if you are not yet a,

360
01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:39.725
uh, disciple of Jesus, uh, believer, follower of Jesus, um,

361
01:14:39.755 --> 01:14:42.685
we'd invite you just to, um, let those trays pass by you.

362
01:14:42.835 --> 01:14:45.245
This is something that Jesus commanded believers to do,

363
01:14:45.345 --> 01:14:46.445
his disciples to do.

364
01:14:47.145 --> 01:14:48.925
So it been that time reflecting.

365
01:14:49.905 --> 01:14:51.765
But if you take those elements, um,

366
01:14:52.755 --> 01:14:55.405
explain a little bit about how we're going to take those,

367
01:14:55.735 --> 01:14:59.445
spend some time in reflection, also inviting those

368
01:14:59.445 --> 01:15:01.565
that are serving to go ahead and start passing those out.

369
01:15:02.755 --> 01:15:06.525
Give a little bit of time for that to, to be passed.

370
01:15:07.515 --> 01:15:11.245
Then I will, um, read from one Corinthians 11

371
01:15:12.745 --> 01:15:14.805
and we'll take the elements together.

372
01:15:15.905 --> 01:15:20.885
Um, and do we need

373
01:15:20.885 --> 01:15:22.605
a prayer moment you think after that?

374
01:15:22.665 --> 01:15:26.325
Or just go straight into the song?

375
01:15:28.475 --> 01:15:29.285

And that'll be it. Can we

445
01:26:59.065 --> 01:27:00.565
do the bumper video again

446
01:27:00.565 --> 01:27:04.805
and see if there's a way we can ease the transition of

447
01:27:04.805 --> 01:27:06.525
that a little bit?

448
01:27:33.575 --> 01:27:38.025
What do you think? Just fade the music out

449
01:27:38.025 --> 01:27:39.345
completely before it gets to that.

450
01:27:39.525 --> 01:27:43.225
Or the bumper video, the way it ends,

451
01:27:45.285 --> 01:27:47.185
it just ends on such an awkward, like,

452
01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:53.345
and it said like a minor chord and it starts to go up

453
01:27:54.765 --> 01:27:56.345
And it, and then I'll have nick extend it

454
01:27:57.245 --> 01:27:58.245
To resolve it. Yeah.

455
01:27:58.245 --> 01:28:00.465
Yeah. It it leaves a tension. Yeah.

456
01:28:00.465 --> 01:28:01.785

01:44:17.265 --> 01:44:21.635
This is where I, right inside,

560
01:44:23.905 --> 01:44:25.315
this is where I

561
01:44:30.315 --> 01:44:30.435
I

562
01:44:59.305 --> 01:45:03.595
that again, this is where I

563
01:45:05.205 --> 01:45:07.395
right inside your house,

564
01:45:08.785 --> 01:45:10.395
this is where I

565
01:45:11.255 --> 01:45:13.275
Be Right inside.

566
01:45:15.055 --> 01:45:16.955
If I was a bird, I,

567
01:45:23.355 --> 01:45:23.475
I

568
01:45:30.245 --> 01:45:32.115
don't ever fight.

569
01:45:38.315 --> 01:45:41.075
I know I along. I

570
01:45:43.485 --> 01:45:46.035
right your side.

571
01:45:47.835 --> 01:45:49.835
I know where I belong.

572
01:45:50.445 --> 01:45:54.715
Right here by your side to open fields.

573
01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:59.515
And I know that you are eating me.

574
01:46:01.715 --> 01:46:02.675
I don't want,

575
01:46:08.515 --> 01:46:08.835
I don't

576
01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:42.995

577
01:46:43.705 --> 01:46:48.515
Amen. Those who the of.

578
01:46:49.225 --> 01:46:50.645

579
01:46:55.225 --> 01:46:56.285
God, can I,

580
01:47:02.305 --> 01:47:03.605

581
01:47:03.995 --> 01:47:04.995
Come on.

01:47:06.755 --> 01:47:10.365

Oh, You name me

586
01:47:25.495 --> 01:47:26.495

587

The

588
01:47:51.375 --> 01:47:56.285
David said, I rather have one day in your house

589
01:47:57.915 --> 01:47:59.725
than a thousand anywhere else.

590
01:48:04.455 --> 01:48:05.725
David said,

591
01:48:07.905 --> 01:48:09.925
I'd rather have one day in your house

592
01:48:11.435 --> 01:48:13.245
than a thousand anywhere else.

593
01:48:17.585 --> 01:48:19.045
So my soul says,

594
01:48:21.025 --> 01:48:25.005
I'd rather have one day in your house than,

595
01:48:28.035 --> 01:48:32.125
than I'd rather have one.

596
01:48:34.425 --> 01:48:35.805
I'd rather have one day

597
01:48:41.475 --> 01:48:42.605
than thousand

598
01:48:43.635 --> 01:48:44.635
Else.

599
01:48:45.895 --> 01:48:48.965
Those who dwell in the house of God.

600
01:48:51.145 --> 01:48:52.145
Wow.

601
01:48:53.385 --> 01:48:56.485
Wow. It Makes my so

No my side.

619
01:52:19.885 --> 01:52:23.785
You the Miami,

620
01:52:29.045 --> 01:52:33.065
my side on

621
01:52:33.125 --> 01:52:34.865
the Miami.

622
01:53:03.025 --> 01:53:03.645
How much is it?

623
01:59:20.755 --> 01:59:22.525
Welcome to Henderson Hills.

624
01:59:25.065 --> 01:59:28.525
We are disciple makers, anchored in truth, compelled by love

625
01:59:28.705 --> 01:59:30.525
and desperately dependent on the Lord.

626
01:59:32.345 --> 01:59:34.245
We are generous with what God has given us

627
01:59:34.625 --> 01:59:36.925
and we share life giving hope with those around us.

628
01:59:39.425 --> 01:59:42.125
Our mission is to equip one another to love Jesus.

629
01:59:42.345 --> 01:59:44.845
And lip syn. We're glad you're here.

630
01:59:49.795 --> 01:59:51.245
Good morning church. We are so glad

631
01:59:51.245 --> 01:59:53.085
that you are here this morning.

632
01:59:53.425 --> 01:59:56.205
Um, a few are new to Henderson Hills

633
01:59:56.225 --> 01:59:58.085
as you're making your way in, uh,

634
01:59:58.085 --> 01:59:59.525
maybe it's the first time you're here

635
01:59:59.525 --> 02:00:01.005
or maybe you've been here for a couple weeks

636
02:00:01.005 --> 02:00:02.085
and you haven't had a chance to

637
02:00:02.085 --> 02:00:03.165
really get plugged in anywhere.

638
02:00:03.635 --> 02:00:06.645
What I would like to first off is just invite you to, uh,

639
02:00:07.115 --> 02:00:09.045
well one thing, just meet someone in here.

640
02:00:09.185 --> 02:00:11.245
Uh, we'll have a second to turn around

641
02:00:11.245 --> 02:00:12.325
and greet each other in a second.

642
02:00:12.425 --> 02:00:14.245
So make sure that you don't leave today

643
02:00:14.245 --> 02:00:16.205
before someone is, uh, shaking your hand.

644
02:00:16.225 --> 02:00:17.845
At least introduce themselves to you.

645
02:00:18.225 --> 02:00:20.845
But another really easy way to start to that, that,

646
02:00:20.875 --> 02:00:23.325
that process of getting plugged in here is to go, uh,

647
02:00:23.325 --> 02:00:25.885
meet someone at our new here desk out in the lobby

648
02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:28.325
afterwards, and they can get you some more information about

649
02:00:28.325 --> 02:00:30.405
what it means to join in, in the life

650
02:00:30.405 --> 02:00:31.445
of Henderson Hills here.

651
02:00:32.185 --> 02:00:34.845
For those of you that maybe have been here for a little bit

652
02:00:34.845 --> 02:00:36.125
of time, maybe a couple weeks

653
02:00:36.225 --> 02:00:37.485
or have been coming for a couple of months,

654
02:00:37.485 --> 02:00:40.845
and you're ready to take that next step of diving deeper

655
02:00:41.635 --> 02:00:43.405
into the life of Henderson Hills,

656
02:00:43.825 --> 02:00:47.125
we have a meaningful membership class that is next Sunday.

657
02:00:47.785 --> 02:00:50.845
Uh, would love to invite you all to come be a part of that.

658
02:00:50.865 --> 02:00:53.645
If you have not, uh, gone through that before,

659
02:00:53.645 --> 02:00:55.285
or if you're just interested in what it looks like

660
02:00:55.285 --> 02:00:57.725
to be a member of Henderson Hills, we'd love to invite you

661
02:00:57.725 --> 02:00:59.125
to come join that as well.

662
02:01:00.065 --> 02:01:02.965
And then the third thing I wanna announce this morning is if

663
02:01:02.985 --> 02:01:04.245
you are looking for a place

664
02:01:04.265 --> 02:01:08.205
to serve here at Henderson Hills, uh, maybe you are a singer

665
02:01:08.465 --> 02:01:09.925
or maybe you play an instrument

666
02:01:10.505 --> 02:01:12.845
or perhaps you're interested in learning how

667
02:01:12.845 --> 02:01:16.205
to run the audio and the visual and the, the lights

668
02:01:16.305 --> 02:01:18.125
and cameras and all that we have here.

669
02:01:18.705 --> 02:01:21.245
Uh, we have an interest worship ministry,

670
02:01:21.525 --> 02:01:23.405
interest lunch next week as well.

671
02:01:23.515 --> 02:01:25.205
That'll be at noon in the offices.

672
02:01:26.065 --> 02:01:29.285
Uh, just come to that, uh, be able to ask some questions,

673
02:01:29.345 --> 02:01:31.165
see what it's like to serve along in the

674
02:01:31.165 --> 02:01:32.645
worship ministry here.

675
02:01:32.715 --> 02:01:34.245
We'd love to be for you to be a part of that.

676
02:01:34.375 --> 02:01:36.245
We'll also have some staff members out in the lobby

677
02:01:36.245 --> 02:01:39.245
after the services if you want to ask 'em a few questions

678
02:01:39.245 --> 02:01:40.245
to see what that looks like.

679
02:01:40.725 --> 02:01:42.205
I would love you to be a, a part of

680
02:01:42.205 --> 02:01:44.205
what we do here at the worship ministry as well.

681
02:01:45.345 --> 02:01:48.845
And like I alluded to, I want to spend this time making sure

682
02:01:48.845 --> 02:01:50.605
that we greet one another, uh,

683
02:01:50.605 --> 02:01:53.045
that we spend the time being a little bit more, more

684
02:01:53.045 --> 02:01:55.285
of the fellowship of the community of Henderson Hills here.

685
02:01:55.305 --> 02:01:56.845
So I want you all to stand up.

686
02:01:58.045 --> 02:02:00.525
Take a little bit of time to greet those around you.

687
02:02:00.855 --> 02:02:03.445
Maybe ask them if we should have a banjo

688
02:02:03.545 --> 02:02:06.725
or a harmonica as part of our worship ministry next.

689
02:03:25.665 --> 02:03:28.685
All right. I, man, I hate to end the conversations early.

690
02:03:28.795 --> 02:03:31.005
Hopefully we can pick those back up after service.

691
02:03:31.745 --> 02:03:34.505
But as we make our way back to our seats this morning,

692
02:03:34.505 --> 02:03:37.265
we're gonna get involved in our time of worship and singing.

693
02:03:37.295 --> 02:03:41.385
This morning. We're gonna be, uh, singing a newer song

694
02:03:41.385 --> 02:03:43.105
that we haven't sung here this morning.

695
02:03:43.765 --> 02:03:46.705
And to explain a little bit what we're singing.

696
02:03:46.775 --> 02:03:48.305
What I would, what I want to do is I wanna start

697
02:03:48.305 --> 02:03:50.985
with reading, uh, Psalm one 13.

698
02:03:52.325 --> 02:03:53.945
Uh, I'm gonna start in verse four

699
02:03:55.045 --> 02:03:56.865
and just listen to this and consider this.

700
02:03:57.065 --> 02:03:58.505
'cause this will set up everything that we're about

701
02:03:58.505 --> 02:03:59.825
to sing together as a church.

702
02:03:59.885 --> 02:04:03.785
So Psalm one 13, starting in verse four, the Lord is high

703
02:04:04.435 --> 02:04:07.345
above all nations in his glory above the heavens.

704
02:04:09.125 --> 02:04:13.545
Who is like the Lord our God who is seated on high,

705
02:04:14.685 --> 02:04:17.985
who looks far down on the heavens and the earth.

706
02:04:19.325 --> 02:04:21.025
He raises the poor from the dust

707
02:04:21.085 --> 02:04:25.305
and he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit

708
02:04:25.305 --> 02:04:28.145
with princes, with the princes of his people.

709
02:04:29.285 --> 02:04:31.145
He gives the barren woman a home,

710
02:04:32.085 --> 02:04:34.185
making her the joyous mother of children.

711
02:04:34.965 --> 02:04:36.025
Praise the Lord.

712
02:04:37.105 --> 02:04:40.405
And so this song that we're going to sing together, it asks

713
02:04:40.405 --> 02:04:42.365
that question, who is like the Lord

714
02:04:43.105 --> 02:04:45.085
who can do these things that the Lord does?

715
02:04:45.145 --> 02:04:46.765
And as we consider that this morning,

716
02:04:47.535 --> 02:04:50.805
let's result in the same way that, that that Psalm does.

717
02:04:50.805 --> 02:04:53.445
And just praising the Lord, declaring how great he is.

718
02:04:53.825 --> 02:04:55.845
So let's sing that together this morning

719
02:04:56.065 --> 02:04:58.165
and declare how great our God is

720
02:05:07.825 --> 02:05:09.645
was there before there was

721
02:05:13.665 --> 02:05:17.245
who illuminates the stars And Son,

722
02:05:19.705 --> 02:05:20.725
who has said,

723
02:05:31.265 --> 02:05:32.685
And who Can

724
02:05:33.185 --> 02:05:35.605
The Storm whisper,

725
02:05:38.265 --> 02:05:41.765
who can make the dark run?

726
02:05:44.385 --> 02:05:44.965
Who can

727
02:07:30.195 --> 02:07:34.255
the one, the Lord over everything

728
02:07:35.455 --> 02:07:36.455
Jesus.

729
02:07:37.025 --> 02:07:40.645
No, Jesus, there is no Father.

730
02:07:41.835 --> 02:07:43.125
Your world will never

731
02:07:43.305 --> 02:07:44.765
Change because

732
02:07:44.835 --> 02:07:49.365
Your name is here to say no.

733
02:07:52.105 --> 02:07:53.105
No.

734
02:07:54.785 --> 02:07:57.485
The Lord

735
02:09:10.595 --> 02:09:11.595
King Jesus. There's

736
02:09:11.595 --> 02:09:15.005
no one like him. Amen.

737
02:09:34.555 --> 02:09:37.725
When I was lost all alone,

738
02:09:38.515 --> 02:09:41.765
your presence was where I found home.

739
02:09:42.705 --> 02:09:47.005
You were there now,

740
02:09:53.695 --> 02:09:58.365
every without

741
02:10:02.335 --> 02:10:05.045
right now sing.

742
02:10:05.045 --> 02:10:06.045
I've witnessed it.

743
02:11:31.765 --> 02:11:31.885
I

744
02:12:03.845 --> 02:12:06.715
God's given us each a story to declare who he is.

745
02:12:07.135 --> 02:12:09.715
So let's sing out of all the good things

746
02:12:09.715 --> 02:12:11.915
that he's done in our lives that we can tell others about.

747
02:12:15.545 --> 02:12:19.875
Good. You are good. And I've witnessed it.

748
02:12:21.775 --> 02:12:23.715
You are strong and I've witnessed it.

749
02:12:25.935 --> 02:12:28.235
You are constant. I've witnessed it

750
02:12:28.975 --> 02:12:32.915
and I'm confident I'll see it again

751
02:12:33.175 --> 02:12:34.715
and again, you,

752
02:12:45.755 --> 02:12:47.095
and I'm confident

753
02:15:06.335 --> 02:15:07.825
your promise is

754
02:15:08.035 --> 02:15:09.035
Never.

755
02:15:10.325 --> 02:15:11.325
And I've got

756
02:15:26.325 --> 02:15:28.545
God, we thank you that you are worthy of all

757
02:15:28.545 --> 02:15:30.665
of our praise, all of our worship.

758
02:15:31.765 --> 02:15:34.105
God, wait, may we think about the things

759
02:15:34.105 --> 02:15:36.545
that you have done in our lives and share that with others.

760
02:15:36.805 --> 02:15:39.545
God, I thank you for salvation

761
02:15:39.645 --> 02:15:41.225
and the good news that that brings us.

762
02:15:44.235 --> 02:15:45.865
Thank you so much. You may have a seat.

763
02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:05.125
Hello. Good morning Church.

764
02:16:05.255 --> 02:16:07.845
Isn't it great to be able to gather like this?

765
02:16:07.985 --> 02:16:09.605
Uh, my name's John. If I haven't met you yet.

766
02:16:09.625 --> 02:16:10.605
I'm one of the pastors here.

767
02:16:10.685 --> 02:16:11.805
I get to preach most of the time.

768
02:16:11.945 --> 02:16:13.765
But I would love to meet you if I get a chance

769
02:16:13.765 --> 02:16:14.965
to at some point soon.

770
02:16:15.505 --> 02:16:17.045
Uh, today is a really exciting day

771
02:16:17.045 --> 02:16:19.965
because we are kicking off a new sermon series

772
02:16:20.515 --> 02:16:25.045
that will take us until Thanksgiving, last fall and spring.

773
02:16:25.185 --> 02:16:29.085
We studied the book of First Samuel looking at that

774
02:16:29.385 --> 02:16:31.005
as it got us into the story.

775
02:16:31.055 --> 02:16:32.405
We're gonna continue the story.

776
02:16:32.505 --> 02:16:37.005
Now as we study the book of Second Samuel last week,

777
02:16:37.005 --> 02:16:38.285
Aaron reminded us really well

778
02:16:38.355 --> 02:16:40.205
that basically this whole thing, first

779
02:16:40.205 --> 02:16:43.765
and second Samuel has been about God's peoples abandonment

780
02:16:44.025 --> 02:16:45.285
of God as their king.

781
02:16:45.985 --> 02:16:48.125
And it was supposed to be a theocracy.

782
02:16:48.345 --> 02:16:50.045
And they were instead searching

783
02:16:50.045 --> 02:16:52.965
for an earthly king like everyone else around them.

784
02:16:54.305 --> 02:16:57.365
But as they did, so a further question was

785
02:16:57.365 --> 02:16:58.645
who was gonna be that king?

786
02:16:58.835 --> 02:17:00.725
That was part of the process of developing

787
02:17:00.725 --> 02:17:02.605
what we saw in one Samuel.

788
02:17:02.605 --> 02:17:05.965
That God had promised a certain man to lead the nation

789
02:17:06.145 --> 02:17:08.485
as the king, but who was that going to be?

790
02:17:08.665 --> 02:17:12.325
And so we looked at who will reign? Who shall reign.

791
02:17:12.345 --> 02:17:14.885
We used this chart, if you remember, we tracked

792
02:17:14.885 --> 02:17:16.765
how God was going to bring that about,

793
02:17:16.865 --> 02:17:19.365
how the transition from judges to kings happened.

794
02:17:19.665 --> 02:17:22.365
And then how the first king was Saul.

795
02:17:22.365 --> 02:17:23.885
And, and Saul looked the part head

796
02:17:23.885 --> 02:17:26.365
and shoulders above everyone else was handsome.

797
02:17:26.385 --> 02:17:29.645
All of this, he looked like he would be the one God would've

798
02:17:29.645 --> 02:17:32.605
picked, but his heart was not close to God.

799
02:17:33.675 --> 02:17:35.295
And so God had promised a man

800
02:17:35.295 --> 02:17:36.935
after God's own heart to lead his people.

801
02:17:37.155 --> 02:17:39.655
And so God anointed David to replace Saul.

802
02:17:41.705 --> 02:17:44.355
Well, second Samuel is the story

803
02:17:44.455 --> 02:17:47.435
of David's rise to the throne.

804
02:17:49.055 --> 02:17:51.515
How did he come into that position?

805
02:17:52.015 --> 02:17:54.235
But then also, how did he, how did he handle it

806
02:17:54.615 --> 02:17:56.635
as he stepped into that role?

807
02:17:57.135 --> 02:17:59.475
Now we're gonna use another chart here in Second Samuel.

808
02:17:59.575 --> 02:18:00.715
So you'll see this every week.

809
02:18:00.715 --> 02:18:03.275
You might take a picture of it at some point, either today

810
02:18:03.335 --> 02:18:04.915
or in the next few weeks.

811
02:18:05.135 --> 02:18:07.435
But as you look at this chart, you're gonna see

812
02:18:08.145 --> 02:18:09.515
David's rise and fall.

813
02:18:09.815 --> 02:18:12.115
That's the book of two Samuel. Shows us that.

814
02:18:12.255 --> 02:18:14.755
And we will learn yes, that, that David

815
02:18:15.735 --> 02:18:18.155
was God's promise king for Israel,

816
02:18:18.775 --> 02:18:20.635
in fact was Israel's greatest king.

817
02:18:21.695 --> 02:18:25.315
But we'll also see that David was limited.

818
02:18:26.875 --> 02:18:28.465
There were some serious limitations.

819
02:18:28.465 --> 02:18:30.785
There's there's a rise to the throne. Yes.

820
02:18:30.885 --> 02:18:33.945
But then we're also gonna see David's faults along the way

821
02:18:34.165 --> 02:18:37.265
and the consequences of what comes as a result.

822
02:18:38.905 --> 02:18:41.915
He's not always the hero we make him out to be,

823
02:18:44.835 --> 02:18:46.865
which means there's something important we need

824
02:18:46.865 --> 02:18:49.025
to just set up from the beginning here.

825
02:18:51.375 --> 02:18:56.335
David is merely a pointer to the true king.

826
02:18:58.355 --> 02:19:03.105
We'll see a lot about David. He's the, the example.

827
02:19:04.405 --> 02:19:07.265
But he's merely a pointer to the true promised

828
02:19:07.855 --> 02:19:09.465
king Jesus.

829
02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:12.595
And so in one sense, we'll see two

830
02:19:12.595 --> 02:19:13.875
Samuel's David's testimony.

831
02:19:14.665 --> 02:19:17.115
Like it's his successes, it's his failures,

832
02:19:17.145 --> 02:19:20.635
it's his experience of God's grace and mercy in his life.

833
02:19:21.215 --> 02:19:25.555
But also, we'll see how all of that points us

834
02:19:26.145 --> 02:19:28.935
forward to the Messiah.

835
02:19:30.125 --> 02:19:32.145
So as we get into this, I wanna start us off just

836
02:19:32.145 --> 02:19:34.505
by praying, uh, briefly and,

837
02:19:34.505 --> 02:19:37.465
and getting this, this whole series laid before the Lord,

838
02:19:37.465 --> 02:19:38.705
because it's not my word.

839
02:19:38.705 --> 02:19:40.625
It's, it's not anything that we can do.

840
02:19:40.655 --> 02:19:42.185
It's, it's his word to us.

841
02:19:42.325 --> 02:19:45.905
And so let's ask for God's power really on this

842
02:19:46.125 --> 02:19:47.425
as we go through the next months.

843
02:19:47.565 --> 02:19:50.705
God thank you. Thank you for your word.

844
02:19:51.395 --> 02:19:53.585
Thank you for the opportunity to study your word,

845
02:19:53.585 --> 02:19:54.705
that we get to see it

846
02:19:55.565 --> 02:19:59.705
and we pray Holy Spirit, that you would apply it

847
02:19:59.705 --> 02:20:01.065
to our lives knowing it happened

848
02:20:01.105 --> 02:20:02.185
a couple thousand years ago.

849
02:20:04.355 --> 02:20:06.935
But the relevance of it for us today

850
02:20:09.765 --> 02:20:12.415
help us to see through the lenses you want us to see

851
02:20:12.415 --> 02:20:15.455
that our world is not that much different.

852
02:20:16.435 --> 02:20:17.935
Our lives, our hearts are not much

853
02:20:18.005 --> 02:20:19.935
that much different from what they were then.

854
02:20:21.195 --> 02:20:24.045
But we need your power. God. This is yours Earth.

855
02:20:26.285 --> 02:20:29.065
Get us outta the way. All the distractions

856
02:20:30.205 --> 02:20:33.305
to let us see your word and see what you want us to see and

857
02:20:33.365 --> 02:20:34.905
and apply what you want us to see.

858
02:20:34.965 --> 02:20:37.505
Not merely being hearers but doers of your word.

859
02:20:39.045 --> 02:20:42.015
Help us God in Jesus' name. Amen.

860
02:20:43.915 --> 02:20:45.295
So I invite you now to turn

861
02:20:45.435 --> 02:20:48.495
to two Samuel in the Old Testament.

862
02:20:49.165 --> 02:20:50.175
It's pretty early in there.

863
02:20:50.175 --> 02:20:52.255
If you start flipping from the front, you'll find it there.

864
02:20:52.355 --> 02:20:54.295
Put a bookmark there. Of course we're gonna be in

865
02:20:54.295 --> 02:20:56.695
that every week over the course of this narrative.

866
02:20:58.355 --> 02:21:00.775
Now as you find it, it might seem like as we go

867
02:21:00.775 --> 02:21:03.095
through this, that we're taking really big chunks

868
02:21:03.315 --> 02:21:05.535
of scripture a couple chapters at a time.

869
02:21:06.195 --> 02:21:07.855
But that's the nature of narrative.

870
02:21:08.285 --> 02:21:11.175
Like you can't break up narrative at times without

871
02:21:11.175 --> 02:21:12.495
losing the point of the story.

872
02:21:13.115 --> 02:21:14.215
So you can look at a little section,

873
02:21:14.275 --> 02:21:15.695
but then you miss the bigger picture.

874
02:21:15.835 --> 02:21:18.215
And so we're gonna take some bigger chunks of it.

875
02:21:18.215 --> 02:21:20.335
Like today we're gonna look at chapters one

876
02:21:20.335 --> 02:21:23.095
through three of two Samuel.

877
02:21:24.055 --> 02:21:26.535
'cause part of it recaps the end of one Samuel,

878
02:21:26.545 --> 02:21:28.015
which we already kind of know about.

879
02:21:29.035 --> 02:21:32.135
But then it also sets up David's reign as the king.

880
02:21:32.155 --> 02:21:34.575
And so we're gonna see all this point together

881
02:21:34.715 --> 02:21:36.335
to see David as the king.

882
02:21:36.365 --> 02:21:39.415
That God wanted, the kind of king that God wanted,

883
02:21:39.415 --> 02:21:42.975
that he was not one who was gonna seize power through

884
02:21:43.695 --> 02:21:45.255
violence or manipulation.

885
02:21:45.675 --> 02:21:47.295
He was going to have an an evident

886
02:21:47.365 --> 02:21:49.255
integrity in the way he was leading.

887
02:21:49.405 --> 02:21:52.615
It's gonna show us all that here in these couple chapters

888
02:21:53.565 --> 02:21:56.955
about David because we're gonna watch him respond

889
02:21:57.135 --> 02:21:58.355
to Saul's death.

890
02:21:59.745 --> 02:22:01.115
Saul died at the end of First Samuel.

891
02:22:01.245 --> 02:22:02.675
We're gonna watch him respond to that.

892
02:22:02.895 --> 02:22:05.635
But then we're also gonna watch him lead through people

893
02:22:06.495 --> 02:22:08.675
in crisis, in chaos and division.

894
02:22:09.455 --> 02:22:13.105
How did he handle that? And we'll see how again, all

895
02:22:13.105 --> 02:22:15.385
of it points us to the greater king Jesus.

896
02:22:16.885 --> 02:22:19.385
And so look with me now at Second Samuel chapter one.

897
02:22:19.445 --> 02:22:20.585
I'm not gonna be able to read all

898
02:22:20.585 --> 02:22:22.105
of these chapters 'cause our time's limited.

899
02:22:22.165 --> 02:22:24.185
But I wanna give you highlights, some summary statements.

900
02:22:24.185 --> 02:22:26.925
We'll dig into the parts that are most critical.

901
02:22:26.985 --> 02:22:29.045
But, but here's what happens right outta the gate.

902
02:22:29.195 --> 02:22:33.205
This is the parallel account to what we saw at the end

903
02:22:33.205 --> 02:22:34.365
of one Samuel of Saul's death.

904
02:22:34.675 --> 02:22:36.485
This is what David was experiencing

905
02:22:36.705 --> 02:22:39.885
as Saul was experiencing the end of his life.

906
02:22:39.985 --> 02:22:41.925
And so let me just again set the tone.

907
02:22:41.925 --> 02:22:44.605
There was, there was a big battle with the Philistines,

908
02:22:44.605 --> 02:22:47.125
a lot of people coming against Israel and,

909
02:22:47.185 --> 02:22:49.605
and David was in a different part of the country.

910
02:22:50.105 --> 02:22:52.725
And so he was experiencing this and hearing this.

911
02:22:53.065 --> 02:22:55.205
But then Saul and Jonathan,

912
02:22:55.345 --> 02:22:58.005
and that's David's best friend, they were in this battle.

913
02:22:58.065 --> 02:23:02.605
And then David heard in this scene about Saul

914
02:23:02.645 --> 02:23:04.765
and Jonathan having died in the battle.

915
02:23:07.095 --> 02:23:09.755
How did he hear about this? Well, they didn't have

916
02:23:10.265 --> 02:23:11.795
like Snapchat or anything.

917
02:23:11.815 --> 02:23:15.235
It wasn't anything like that. It was, it was this man

918
02:23:15.865 --> 02:23:20.635
running a long way to tell David he happened

919
02:23:20.635 --> 02:23:23.275
to be from Saul's camp and he happened to be in Amalekite.

920
02:23:23.335 --> 02:23:26.315
The Amalekites were the defeated enemies of God's people

921
02:23:26.375 --> 02:23:28.995
and they were enslaved by the the leaders.

922
02:23:29.215 --> 02:23:34.075
And so this man came and told David about Saul's death.

923
02:23:36.705 --> 02:23:38.285
Now he wanted to impress David.

924
02:23:39.135 --> 02:23:41.245
David didn't know who he was. He wanted to impress David.

925
02:23:41.425 --> 02:23:44.445
And he in his mind thought, man, David's gonna love

926
02:23:44.665 --> 02:23:47.285
to hear about his enemy, Saul dying.

927
02:23:48.545 --> 02:23:50.685
And so I'm gonna tell him I'm gonna be the one

928
02:23:50.825 --> 02:23:53.765
to inform David about Saul's death.

929
02:23:53.865 --> 02:23:56.685
And what he does in it is he says, Hey, hey David.

930
02:23:57.645 --> 02:24:00.995
I was the one who killed Saul. It was me.

931
02:24:03.255 --> 02:24:07.075
Now if you remember from one Samuel 31, that's a discrepancy

932
02:24:08.935 --> 02:24:12.545
because Saul in the battle was so badly wounded,

933
02:24:12.545 --> 02:24:15.265
he actually fell on his own sword in that chapter.

934
02:24:17.475 --> 02:24:21.575
And so we discover that this amalekite was apparently lying

935
02:24:21.715 --> 02:24:23.295
to David to gain favor.

936
02:24:24.705 --> 02:24:28.175
Maybe I'll get a a part in his, his kingship.

937
02:24:28.205 --> 02:24:29.615
I'll get a a good role.

938
02:24:32.255 --> 02:24:35.705
Well let's watch David respond to the news.

939
02:24:35.775 --> 02:24:39.265
This is verses 11 and 12 of two Samuel one.

940
02:24:43.265 --> 02:24:44.525
He hears of Saul's death.

941
02:24:44.595 --> 02:24:47.405
Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them.

942
02:24:48.385 --> 02:24:50.165
And so did all the men who were with him.

943
02:24:50.225 --> 02:24:54.965
And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul

944
02:24:54.985 --> 02:24:57.445
and for Jonathan, his son, and for the people of the Lord

945
02:24:58.025 --> 02:24:59.365
and for the house of Israel

946
02:24:59.635 --> 02:25:02.125
because they had fallen by the sword.

947
02:25:04.755 --> 02:25:06.055
Now don't forget something here.

948
02:25:07.725 --> 02:25:11.685
Saul was the man who had tried to kill David multiple times.

949
02:25:13.115 --> 02:25:14.765
He'd hunted him like a wild animal.

950
02:25:15.145 --> 02:25:18.165
He had David on the run for 10 years in the wilderness.

951
02:25:19.795 --> 02:25:24.605
That was who David, look at his heart, right David, instead

952
02:25:24.605 --> 02:25:26.565
of hating Saul, there was grief.

953
02:25:28.185 --> 02:25:30.435
Instead of rejoicing over Saul's death,

954
02:25:30.565 --> 02:25:32.395
there was a sense of mourning.

955
02:25:33.325 --> 02:25:37.035
David grieved the loss of the Lord's anointed king.

956
02:25:37.465 --> 02:25:39.795
Even though it was Saul, David grieved it

957
02:25:39.795 --> 02:25:41.355
because he was anointed by God.

958
02:25:41.355 --> 02:25:44.315
He even wrote a song. David wrote most of the Psalms.

959
02:25:44.415 --> 02:25:46.395
He even wrote a song of lament

960
02:25:47.935 --> 02:25:49.595
to be sung by God's people.

961
02:25:49.655 --> 02:25:52.315
You find it here in verses 19 through 27.

962
02:25:52.895 --> 02:25:54.755
I'm just gonna read a couple key parts of this.

963
02:25:56.345 --> 02:25:59.075
This is David's song about Saul and Jonathan dying.

964
02:25:59.075 --> 02:26:02.475
It says, your glory, Israel is slain on your high places.

965
02:26:03.135 --> 02:26:05.195
How the mighty have fallen.

966
02:26:06.945 --> 02:26:08.315
Saul and Jonathan, beloved

967
02:26:08.375 --> 02:26:10.955
and lovely in life, in death, they were not divided.

968
02:26:11.145 --> 02:26:12.795
They were swifter than eagles.

969
02:26:12.945 --> 02:26:14.595
They were stronger than lions.

970
02:26:16.695 --> 02:26:20.755
How the mighty have fallen the weapons of war perished.

971
02:26:22.815 --> 02:26:25.795
So David is grieving even publicly

972
02:26:27.045 --> 02:26:28.195
about Saul's death.

973
02:26:29.555 --> 02:26:31.255
Not only that, but look at how he responded

974
02:26:31.255 --> 02:26:33.335
to the Amalekite man who told him about Saul's death

975
02:26:33.335 --> 02:26:35.575
and told him that he had been the one who killed Saul.

976
02:26:35.575 --> 02:26:37.655
Look at verses 14 through 16.

977
02:26:41.145 --> 02:26:43.455
David said to him, how is it that you are not afraid

978
02:26:43.515 --> 02:26:46.135
to put out your hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?

979
02:26:47.125 --> 02:26:48.615
Then David called one of the young men

980
02:26:48.615 --> 02:26:50.015
and said, go execute him.

981
02:26:51.505 --> 02:26:53.045
And he struck him down so that he died.

982
02:26:53.045 --> 02:26:55.285
And David said to him, your blood be on your head

983
02:26:55.465 --> 02:26:59.485
for your own mouth has testified against you saying,

984
02:26:59.685 --> 02:27:01.445
I have killed the Lord's anointed.

985
02:27:03.835 --> 02:27:06.335
And so David had this man who claimed to kill Saul,

986
02:27:06.355 --> 02:27:09.455
had him executed because of his admission.

987
02:27:11.565 --> 02:27:13.935
Like this man should have recognized the sanctity

988
02:27:13.955 --> 02:27:18.695
of the Lord's anointed king As Saul was the king.

989
02:27:18.915 --> 02:27:20.935
And he should not have have been

990
02:27:20.995 --> 02:27:23.695
so flippantly handling that life.

991
02:27:23.865 --> 02:27:25.975
David himself, remember how David handled this?

992
02:27:26.025 --> 02:27:28.215
David had a couple opportunities

993
02:27:28.755 --> 02:27:31.535
to take Saul's life, but he didn't.

994
02:27:33.315 --> 02:27:37.585
He Could have gained the throne improperly

995
02:27:37.765 --> 02:27:39.825
by taking Saul's life, but he didn't.

996
02:27:41.215 --> 02:27:44.385
This man, the Amalekite man was trying to manipulate things

997
02:27:44.525 --> 02:27:45.745
to his own ends.

998
02:27:45.845 --> 02:27:47.265
And what happened? He paid the price.

999
02:27:51.645 --> 02:27:56.445
Here's the point. David revealed his

1000
02:27:56.445 --> 02:27:59.525
heart in his response to Saul's death.

1001
02:28:01.165 --> 02:28:04.595
Like we see very clearly David's heart

1002
02:28:05.545 --> 02:28:07.235
when he hears about Saul's death.

1003
02:28:08.975 --> 02:28:12.545
This man who tried to take him out, he's gone.

1004
02:28:12.965 --> 02:28:15.625
How did David respond? Well, he could have rejoiced.

1005
02:28:18.005 --> 02:28:19.025
Saul's finally gone.

1006
02:28:20.005 --> 02:28:22.525
The pathway's finally clear for me to be the king.

1007
02:28:22.665 --> 02:28:26.625
He could have rejoiced thrown a party, but he didn't.

1008
02:28:27.635 --> 02:28:30.055
He grieved. He mourned, he wept.

1009
02:28:32.445 --> 02:28:35.395
Which leads to a question for us.

1010
02:28:37.515 --> 02:28:38.895
Is that how you love your enemies?

1011
02:28:43.325 --> 02:28:47.495
Like do you grieve when your enemy suffers?

1012
02:28:49.555 --> 02:28:53.685
When your enemy, your opponent, the antagonist in your life,

1013
02:28:54.625 --> 02:28:58.485
do you grieve when they suffer or especially when they die?

1014
02:28:59.105 --> 02:29:01.365
Or are you more apt to throw a party for it?

1015
02:29:01.425 --> 02:29:02.885
Are you to celebrate it?

1016
02:29:02.915 --> 02:29:07.805
Like to, to encourage the excitement around you about

1017
02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:09.285
that person's downfall?

1018
02:29:13.515 --> 02:29:15.855
We saw this in Romans 12 this summer.

1019
02:29:17.795 --> 02:29:21.775
One of the most challenging realignment statements in Romans

1020
02:29:21.775 --> 02:29:25.255
12 is verses 19 and 20.

1021
02:29:25.315 --> 02:29:27.895
It says, beloved never avenge yourselves,

1022
02:29:28.595 --> 02:29:30.415
but leave it to the wrath of God.

1023
02:29:30.795 --> 02:29:32.895
For it is written, vengeance is mine,

1024
02:29:33.255 --> 02:29:34.935
I will repay, says the Lord.

1025
02:29:35.835 --> 02:29:38.415
To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.

1026
02:29:38.835 --> 02:29:41.375
If he's thirsty, give him something to drink for.

1027
02:29:41.515 --> 02:29:45.215
By so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head.

1028
02:29:47.225 --> 02:29:49.185
Remember, David had multiple opportunities

1029
02:29:49.605 --> 02:29:53.025
to take out his enemy to kill Saul, but he didn't.

1030
02:29:55.105 --> 02:29:57.565
He could have made his life a whole lot easier,

1031
02:29:57.945 --> 02:30:01.325
but instead he trusted that God's justice is perfect.

1032
02:30:02.105 --> 02:30:04.045
Our revenge is never perfect.

1033
02:30:06.085 --> 02:30:07.465
We don't always see the whole story.

1034
02:30:07.525 --> 02:30:09.545
We don't always handle it exactly as we should.

1035
02:30:09.765 --> 02:30:14.105
And so he trusted God to take care of Saul as he did.

1036
02:30:14.245 --> 02:30:16.825
And notice it turned out a whole lot better

1037
02:30:16.885 --> 02:30:18.505
for David than if he would've done it himself

1038
02:30:20.255 --> 02:30:24.225
because David is is completely innocent.

1039
02:30:24.335 --> 02:30:27.105
There's no way anyone could accuse David

1040
02:30:27.725 --> 02:30:30.265
of anything improper here he was in a

1041
02:30:30.265 --> 02:30:31.305
completely different part of the country.

1042
02:30:31.305 --> 02:30:32.505
Didn't even know it was happening.

1043
02:30:32.855 --> 02:30:35.865
He's his hands were clean in Saul's death.

1044
02:30:36.205 --> 02:30:37.225
How could he say that?

1045
02:30:37.225 --> 02:30:41.385
Because he had overcome evil with good,

1046
02:30:42.855 --> 02:30:46.365
he didn't try to overcome evil with more evil, right?

1047
02:30:46.365 --> 02:30:49.045
Martin Luther King Jr. Said that that only adds to evil.

1048
02:30:51.125 --> 02:30:53.345
He said, I'm gonna overcome evil with good.

1049
02:30:53.405 --> 02:30:56.785
And it turned out exactly right for David.

1050
02:31:00.025 --> 02:31:03.525
And so this principle from Romans 12

1051
02:31:04.585 --> 02:31:06.925
is the same for us today.

1052
02:31:08.485 --> 02:31:10.905
For us who are believers in Christ, follow Jesus.

1053
02:31:11.085 --> 02:31:14.265
We claim to be Christians in our lives.

1054
02:31:15.735 --> 02:31:19.685
That means things should look different in, in our lives.

1055
02:31:21.265 --> 02:31:23.565
Things should be different in how we handle those

1056
02:31:23.565 --> 02:31:25.085
who oppose us, those who are enemies,

1057
02:31:25.365 --> 02:31:26.605
whatever we would call it, right?

1058
02:31:27.065 --> 02:31:29.045
Things should look a little bit different in

1059
02:31:29.105 --> 02:31:33.805
how we handle things like the way we speak about those

1060
02:31:33.865 --> 02:31:36.085
who are on the opposite side of the spectrum from us.

1061
02:31:39.585 --> 02:31:43.125
Our social media usage should be different in the way we

1062
02:31:43.125 --> 02:31:46.725
speak about people who may be different or may be opposed.

1063
02:31:48.915 --> 02:31:53.185
The bumper stickers on your car should look different

1064
02:31:53.935 --> 02:31:55.345
than everybody else's in the world.

1065
02:31:57.825 --> 02:31:59.515
This is true about us.

1066
02:31:59.535 --> 02:32:03.315
Now it doesn't mean you, you would trust your enemy.

1067
02:32:03.515 --> 02:32:07.355
I I get that. But if Jesus said, love your enemies

1068
02:32:07.615 --> 02:32:09.475
and pray for those who persecute you,

1069
02:32:10.965 --> 02:32:14.655
then we should not participate in rejoicing over

1070
02:32:14.755 --> 02:32:16.015
our opponent's failures.

1071
02:32:16.915 --> 02:32:19.155
We should grieve like David.

1072
02:32:19.455 --> 02:32:21.875
We should grieve when a failure happens.

1073
02:32:21.975 --> 02:32:24.395
We should grieve, uh, the mourning when someone

1074
02:32:24.905 --> 02:32:25.955
dies like that again.

1075
02:32:25.955 --> 02:32:29.515
We don't trust that we have to give our lives away to them.

1076
02:32:29.775 --> 02:32:33.675
No, but we should speak as well as we can about those,

1077
02:32:33.905 --> 02:32:35.395
even those who've wronged us,

1078
02:32:38.255 --> 02:32:41.945
be honorable towards those who

1079
02:32:42.575 --> 02:32:45.105
deserve honor, which the image of bearer of God

1080
02:32:45.105 --> 02:32:46.545
that everyone is deserves honor,

1081
02:32:49.745 --> 02:32:52.635
even despite their failures towards us.

1082
02:32:52.965 --> 02:32:56.085
Maybe that's what Jesus did.

1083
02:32:57.715 --> 02:33:02.505
This is what David modeled for us. David was a hi.

1084
02:33:02.525 --> 02:33:04.705
His heart was so in love with God

1085
02:33:06.505 --> 02:33:10.295
that he could love his enemy, even mourning

1086
02:33:10.295 --> 02:33:13.975
and grieving the loss, the death of this man

1087
02:33:14.275 --> 02:33:15.415
who had persecuted him.

1088
02:33:16.005 --> 02:33:19.615
Like that's a great king, isn't it?

1089
02:33:21.385 --> 02:33:24.645
That's a great king that he could be trusted like that.

1090
02:33:26.785 --> 02:33:30.155
Well, here's another aspect of David's qualifications.

1091
02:33:30.265 --> 02:33:32.115
This is chapters two and three.

1092
02:33:32.145 --> 02:33:34.915
Show us this again right after Saul died.

1093
02:33:35.755 --> 02:33:40.395
I mean he, it seemed like the pathway was open

1094
02:33:40.775 --> 02:33:43.035
for the, for David to take the throne.

1095
02:33:45.015 --> 02:33:48.275
But like the legend has said, not so fast my friend.

1096
02:33:52.005 --> 02:33:53.585
See, remember the chart? You're gonna see this

1097
02:33:53.585 --> 02:33:54.745
again throughout the series.

1098
02:33:55.245 --> 02:33:56.505
If you look all the way on the left,

1099
02:33:58.155 --> 02:34:00.345
David was immediately anointed king

1100
02:34:00.405 --> 02:34:04.445
but only anointed king of Judah, one

1101
02:34:04.465 --> 02:34:06.965
of the tribes of Israel.

1102
02:34:08.865 --> 02:34:11.045
And he made his home in he, which

1103
02:34:11.785 --> 02:34:13.285
it doesn't fit the rest of the story.

1104
02:34:13.445 --> 02:34:14.445
'cause you think Jerusalem and

1105
02:34:14.445 --> 02:34:15.445
all this stuff, yes, we'll get there.

1106
02:34:15.625 --> 02:34:17.645
But until then he's just, just in Hebrew,

1107
02:34:18.045 --> 02:34:21.845
a a little town in the south and he's king of one tribe.

1108
02:34:22.575 --> 02:34:26.175
Judah, Because Abner,

1109
02:34:26.485 --> 02:34:28.975
there's a name you're gonna need to remember, the commander

1110
02:34:28.975 --> 02:34:30.055
of Saul's army.

1111
02:34:31.625 --> 02:34:34.735
Abner had taken one of Saul's other sons

1112
02:34:34.735 --> 02:34:36.415
that didn't die in the battle ish.

1113
02:34:36.585 --> 02:34:37.655
Boche, that's his name.

1114
02:34:38.295 --> 02:34:40.655
I don't hear kids' name that anymore. I don't know why.

1115
02:34:40.835 --> 02:34:45.455
But uh, his name ish Boche, you can remember

1116
02:34:45.455 --> 02:34:47.975
that probably he Abner said, okay, no,

1117
02:34:47.975 --> 02:34:50.095
this son is the king of the rest of Israel.

1118
02:34:51.125 --> 02:34:53.135
David's king of Judah one tribe.

1119
02:34:53.355 --> 02:34:56.055
The 11 tribes are under this guy

1120
02:34:56.275 --> 02:34:59.655
and I'm his military commander, David Joab.

1121
02:34:59.835 --> 02:35:01.455
You guys are in Judah, that's fine.

1122
02:35:01.715 --> 02:35:04.855
But what we see setting up here is a civil war, right?

1123
02:35:05.645 --> 02:35:07.375
There's supposed to be one nation.

1124
02:35:08.555 --> 02:35:11.135
Now we've got this split happening with two people who claim

1125
02:35:11.395 --> 02:35:12.855
to be the king.

1126
02:35:15.085 --> 02:35:16.505
But notice what Abner was doing.

1127
02:35:16.525 --> 02:35:18.385
It was, it's a classic case of human

1128
02:35:19.005 --> 02:35:21.465
wisdom versus divine appointment.

1129
02:35:22.005 --> 02:35:23.545
God said, David's gonna be the king.

1130
02:35:24.235 --> 02:35:28.745
Abner said, no, this guy is, it's already setting up

1131
02:35:28.745 --> 02:35:29.825
to be a clash.

1132
02:35:31.865 --> 02:35:35.435
Well look at what chapter three verse one says,

1133
02:35:37.815 --> 02:35:39.185
just the second part of this.

1134
02:35:40.175 --> 02:35:43.665
This is the battle it's forming. The Civil War is beginning.

1135
02:35:43.755 --> 02:35:45.305
Watch what this verse says

1136
02:35:45.685 --> 02:35:47.305
to see the results of what happens.

1137
02:35:49.965 --> 02:35:52.275
It says there was a long war between the house of Saul,

1138
02:35:52.275 --> 02:35:54.795
the house of David, and David grew stronger

1139
02:35:55.055 --> 02:35:56.915
and stronger while the house

1140
02:35:57.015 --> 02:35:59.955
of Saul became weaker and weaker.

1141
02:36:03.605 --> 02:36:06.025
God who had promised this many, many years

1142
02:36:06.025 --> 02:36:10.585
before was shifting the kingdom to David.

1143
02:36:12.045 --> 02:36:13.945
It was happening even in a battle.

1144
02:36:16.625 --> 02:36:18.285
But here's what's interesting about this story.

1145
02:36:18.745 --> 02:36:19.965
It takes a little bit of a turn

1146
02:36:19.965 --> 02:36:23.965
because Abner actually defects from ish Bhe

1147
02:36:23.965 --> 02:36:25.805
and he comes over and he starts to follow David.

1148
02:36:26.745 --> 02:36:30.685
And all the 11 tribes that used to be under that side began

1149
02:36:30.945 --> 02:36:33.085
to slowly trickle over to follow David.

1150
02:36:33.085 --> 02:36:34.685
We'll see that over the next couple chapters.

1151
02:36:36.745 --> 02:36:38.085
And so Abner says, no, I'm

1152
02:36:38.085 --> 02:36:39.845
with David Now there was a problem though

1153
02:36:39.845 --> 02:36:44.045
because Joe Ab, who is David's primary military leader,

1154
02:36:44.225 --> 02:36:45.845
was not involved in those conversations.

1155
02:36:46.145 --> 02:36:49.925
So imagine this Joe AB is on the opposite side from Abner.

1156
02:36:49.985 --> 02:36:51.445
And then he comes home one day

1157
02:36:51.545 --> 02:36:53.925
and all of a sudden he hears that Abner's on their side.

1158
02:36:53.985 --> 02:36:56.925
Now watch what happens here.

1159
02:36:58.475 --> 02:37:01.565
This is chapter three verses 22 through 25.

1160
02:37:02.675 --> 02:37:05.045
This is what Joab thought of the whole situation.

1161
02:37:09.915 --> 02:37:11.645
Just then the servants of David arrived

1162
02:37:11.715 --> 02:37:14.485
with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them.

1163
02:37:14.825 --> 02:37:17.085
But Abner was not with David at Hebron

1164
02:37:17.085 --> 02:37:20.125
for he'd sent him away and he'd gone in peace when Joab

1165
02:37:20.125 --> 02:37:23.365
and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab,

1166
02:37:23.975 --> 02:37:26.685
Abner the son, Abner came to the king, he's let him go

1167
02:37:26.705 --> 02:37:28.125
and he's gone in peace.

1168
02:37:29.225 --> 02:37:31.645
And then Joab went to the king and said, what have you done?

1169
02:37:34.325 --> 02:37:35.905
Be old Abner came to you.

1170
02:37:36.365 --> 02:37:38.585
Why is it you sent him away so that he's gone?

1171
02:37:38.645 --> 02:37:41.585
You know, Abner, the Sonner came to deceive you

1172
02:37:42.525 --> 02:37:44.585
and to know you're going out and you're coming in

1173
02:37:44.605 --> 02:37:46.625
and to know all that you are doing.

1174
02:37:48.575 --> 02:37:50.985
He's like, dude, listen. Did you not? That's your enemy.

1175
02:37:51.735 --> 02:37:53.425
Abner's your enemy. What are you doing?

1176
02:37:54.165 --> 02:37:56.105
You're giving him a chance to see what we're doing

1177
02:37:56.125 --> 02:37:58.385
and how we're gonna battle his people.

1178
02:37:59.725 --> 02:38:01.105
Now lemme just give you a side note.

1179
02:38:03.595 --> 02:38:07.305
Abner had killed Joe Abs brother in the earlier battle.

1180
02:38:07.765 --> 02:38:10.665
So there was some serious animosity between these two guys,

1181
02:38:10.735 --> 02:38:13.345
even though they're on the opposite sides, there's even more

1182
02:38:13.365 --> 02:38:16.385
so that there's this personal piece of it as well.

1183
02:38:18.035 --> 02:38:21.495
And so Joab watch how he handles this.

1184
02:38:21.545 --> 02:38:25.935
Verse 26, when Joab came out from David's presence,

1185
02:38:25.935 --> 02:38:27.695
he sent messengers after Abner

1186
02:38:27.795 --> 02:38:30.095
and they brought him back from the cistern of Cyrah.

1187
02:38:30.235 --> 02:38:32.095
But David did not know about it.

1188
02:38:33.715 --> 02:38:34.975
And when Abner returned to Hebrew

1189
02:38:34.975 --> 02:38:37.535
and Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak

1190
02:38:37.535 --> 02:38:40.495
with him privately and there he struck him in the stomach so

1191
02:38:40.495 --> 02:38:44.335
that he died for the blood of Asel, his brother.

1192
02:38:47.745 --> 02:38:50.925
And so here we have another test for David.

1193
02:38:54.145 --> 02:38:57.165
We have division in the nation,

1194
02:38:59.565 --> 02:39:02.305
we have this conflict amongst his leaders.

1195
02:39:05.465 --> 02:39:09.565
And now there's this murder which could have been

1196
02:39:10.965 --> 02:39:12.675
understood that David was the one

1197
02:39:12.675 --> 02:39:14.355
who manipulated this whole thing to work out,

1198
02:39:14.355 --> 02:39:16.395
that he had job go take out Abner.

1199
02:39:16.495 --> 02:39:18.315
It could have come back to David.

1200
02:39:18.495 --> 02:39:20.075
At the very least, it's one

1201
02:39:20.075 --> 02:39:22.315
of his generals murdering someone.

1202
02:39:22.385 --> 02:39:27.035
Like that's all really a big test for David's leadership.

1203
02:39:27.685 --> 02:39:31.905
How's he gonna lead through this crisis? Watch this.

1204
02:39:33.075 --> 02:39:37.785
Verse 28 afterward, when David heard

1205
02:39:37.785 --> 02:39:41.585
of it, he said, I and my kingdom are forever guiltless

1206
02:39:41.885 --> 02:39:44.625
before the Lord for the blood of Abner.

1207
02:39:44.685 --> 02:39:47.985
The son of no like he publicly

1208
02:39:48.935 --> 02:39:50.105
disavowed abner's.

1209
02:39:50.165 --> 02:39:51.945
He had, I have nothing to do with this.

1210
02:39:53.915 --> 02:39:56.085
Even watch this verse 29.

1211
02:39:56.945 --> 02:39:58.445
May it fall upon the head of Joab

1212
02:39:58.445 --> 02:40:00.085
and upon all his father's house, may the house

1213
02:40:00.085 --> 02:40:01.285
of Joab never be without.

1214
02:40:01.355 --> 02:40:05.445
Like he, he calls a curse down on Joab.

1215
02:40:06.515 --> 02:40:08.205
He's like, I didn't have anything to do with this.

1216
02:40:09.075 --> 02:40:11.365
Joab did it. And he is cursed

1217
02:40:11.365 --> 02:40:14.365
because of the vengeance he took on Abner.

1218
02:40:14.365 --> 02:40:18.445
Now look at verses 31 and 32, then David said to Joab

1219
02:40:18.445 --> 02:40:20.485
and to all the people who are with him, tear your clothes,

1220
02:40:20.705 --> 02:40:22.045
put on sackcloth and mourn

1221
02:40:22.045 --> 02:40:24.165
before Abner King David followed the beer,

1222
02:40:24.225 --> 02:40:28.325
the the funeral procession, they buried Abner at he

1223
02:40:28.665 --> 02:40:30.005
and the king lifted up his voice

1224
02:40:30.025 --> 02:40:34.125
and wept at the grave of Abner and all the people wept.

1225
02:40:34.625 --> 02:40:38.365
So again, just like with Saul, what's David doing?

1226
02:40:38.675 --> 02:40:41.045
He's publicly mourning for his enemy.

1227
02:40:42.255 --> 02:40:44.535
I mean remember Abner was on Saul's side.

1228
02:40:45.585 --> 02:40:47.885
He would've helped Saul try to take out David.

1229
02:40:48.105 --> 02:40:51.165
And now David is saying this enemy,

1230
02:40:51.505 --> 02:40:53.245
I'm mourning for his death.

1231
02:40:56.495 --> 02:40:58.035
And now verse 35,

1232
02:41:00.655 --> 02:41:02.345
then all the people came to persuade David

1233
02:41:02.345 --> 02:41:03.985
to eat bread while it was yet day.

1234
02:41:04.125 --> 02:41:06.305
But David swore saying, God do so to me

1235
02:41:06.305 --> 02:41:07.985
and more also if I taste bread

1236
02:41:07.985 --> 02:41:10.705
or anything else till the sun goes down.

1237
02:41:10.805 --> 02:41:15.425
That's just a sign of grief, lamenting publicly fasting

1238
02:41:15.575 --> 02:41:17.785
because of the death of Abner.

1239
02:41:21.215 --> 02:41:22.875
But I want you to watch what all that did.

1240
02:41:23.415 --> 02:41:25.515
So that was David's response to this whole crisis.

1241
02:41:26.245 --> 02:41:28.515
Watch what happens next, 36 and 37.

1242
02:41:31.935 --> 02:41:35.035
And all the people took notice of it

1243
02:41:36.785 --> 02:41:40.405
and it pleased them as everything that the king did,

1244
02:41:40.405 --> 02:41:41.405
pleased all the people.

1245
02:41:41.825 --> 02:41:44.765
So all the people in all Israel understood that day

1246
02:41:44.915 --> 02:41:47.765
that had not been the king's will to put to death.

1247
02:41:48.015 --> 02:41:49.325
Abner the son of Ner.

1248
02:41:51.605 --> 02:41:54.725
So you see what happened, David's

1249
02:41:54.845 --> 02:41:56.685
transparency, David's integrity.

1250
02:41:56.955 --> 02:42:01.205
Through the process, it won the people's hearts.

1251
02:42:04.655 --> 02:42:06.285
David led with integrity.

1252
02:42:07.855 --> 02:42:11.025
Like this is why God could trust David to be the king,

1253
02:42:11.365 --> 02:42:13.025
not Saul whose heart was far from God.

1254
02:42:13.025 --> 02:42:14.465
David's heart is close to God.

1255
02:42:14.645 --> 02:42:17.105
And he says here David, I'm gonna give you the kingship.

1256
02:42:17.165 --> 02:42:20.945
Why? Because here we see even through division, David led

1257
02:42:20.945 --> 02:42:22.705
through that with integrity.

1258
02:42:25.165 --> 02:42:26.985
All kinds of things could go haywire here,

1259
02:42:29.175 --> 02:42:30.905
divided people, divided leaders.

1260
02:42:32.325 --> 02:42:35.105
But David led with integrity

1261
02:42:38.075 --> 02:42:40.605
through division, through war, through blatant sin.

1262
02:42:40.655 --> 02:42:44.325
David was that. Now listen, what does integrity even mean?

1263
02:42:46.105 --> 02:42:48.915
Integrity is when your private life matches

1264
02:42:49.265 --> 02:42:50.395
your public testimony.

1265
02:42:51.025 --> 02:42:54.025
Like it's not your one way, that way

1266
02:42:54.125 --> 02:42:58.975
and one way here you're the same in every situation.

1267
02:42:59.675 --> 02:43:00.735
Is that true of you?

1268
02:43:03.655 --> 02:43:05.795
And I'm not just saying like when things are really good in

1269
02:43:05.795 --> 02:43:07.715
life, of course it's easy to be the same both ways.

1270
02:43:07.735 --> 02:43:09.115
But when things crumble in your life

1271
02:43:09.215 --> 02:43:11.685
and internally you're one way but externally

1272
02:43:11.685 --> 02:43:15.925
or a different way is your life marked by integrity?

1273
02:43:16.305 --> 02:43:20.045
And let's just, let's just play it out in real ways.

1274
02:43:22.705 --> 02:43:25.895
Think about how often we as Christians

1275
02:43:28.175 --> 02:43:30.275
say we should act in certain ways

1276
02:43:32.205 --> 02:43:35.425
and then the reality of our lives looks radically different.

1277
02:43:38.675 --> 02:43:40.975
And and I'm not saying that just from kind

1278
02:43:40.975 --> 02:43:45.855
of objective evidence, statistically this bears out.

1279
02:43:47.895 --> 02:43:49.245
Lemme just give you a couple examples.

1280
02:43:51.315 --> 02:43:53.455
We talk about sexual purity a lot,

1281
02:43:56.435 --> 02:43:57.495
yet pornography

1282
02:43:57.915 --> 02:44:00.935
and just messing around runs rampant,

1283
02:44:02.895 --> 02:44:05.355
not just through young people, through

1284
02:44:05.355 --> 02:44:06.515
older generations as well.

1285
02:44:11.385 --> 02:44:13.645
We declare that, that we

1286
02:44:13.645 --> 02:44:16.605
as Christians believe in the sacredness of marriage.

1287
02:44:17.825 --> 02:44:20.405
And yet dozens upon dozens of spouses

1288
02:44:20.915 --> 02:44:23.125
feel mistreated.

1289
02:44:23.315 --> 02:44:27.815
They're terrified and they're abused within churches.

1290
02:44:33.865 --> 02:44:37.885
We say we believe in caring for the poor, caring

1291
02:44:37.905 --> 02:44:40.805
for the outcast, being generous to those in need,

1292
02:44:41.145 --> 02:44:45.005
yet our money and our time flow to the lake house

1293
02:44:45.505 --> 02:44:47.285
or to more toys for ourselves.

1294
02:44:52.965 --> 02:44:55.595
And we could go on and on we

1295
02:44:55.775 --> 02:44:58.565
say, And yet we do.

1296
02:45:02.965 --> 02:45:04.145
And listen, here's the problem.

1297
02:45:04.815 --> 02:45:07.945
It's not just that we're disobeying God when our lives

1298
02:45:08.595 --> 02:45:11.785
don't come close to matching what we say.

1299
02:45:14.115 --> 02:45:18.895
The world sees all this as mere religious performance.

1300
02:45:20.375 --> 02:45:21.785
They don't see true faith.

1301
02:45:22.255 --> 02:45:25.505
They see a social club with a little bit

1302
02:45:25.505 --> 02:45:27.185
of morality sprinkled on top of it.

1303
02:45:29.445 --> 02:45:34.235
Is that what this is? Now we

1304
02:45:34.375 --> 02:45:38.375
say it's not, but

1305
02:45:38.375 --> 02:45:39.575
does it play out that way?

1306
02:45:43.405 --> 02:45:45.465
And so something needs to change in our lives, right?

1307
02:45:46.935 --> 02:45:49.185
Like something needs to change and

1308
02:45:49.185 --> 02:45:51.065
and we see David living with integrity

1309
02:45:51.065 --> 02:45:52.225
through the chaos of all that.

1310
02:45:52.225 --> 02:45:54.745
How did he get there? Well, I want you

1311
02:45:54.745 --> 02:45:56.025
to watch something real quick.

1312
02:45:56.085 --> 02:45:57.905
Go back to chapter two, verse one,

1313
02:46:00.585 --> 02:46:01.835
chapter two, verse one.

1314
02:46:01.835 --> 02:46:04.395
This is right after Saul died. He finds out about it.

1315
02:46:04.765 --> 02:46:09.685
Watch this Chapter two verse one.

1316
02:46:10.015 --> 02:46:14.845
After this, after Saul died, David inquired of the Lord,

1317
02:46:15.695 --> 02:46:18.045
shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?

1318
02:46:18.665 --> 02:46:20.285
And the Lord said to him, go up.

1319
02:46:20.425 --> 02:46:22.885
And David said, okay, to which shall I go up?

1320
02:46:23.105 --> 02:46:24.965
And God said to he,

1321
02:46:27.045 --> 02:46:29.185
now we could skate over that really quickly.

1322
02:46:29.365 --> 02:46:34.105
But did you see the key phrase, David inquired

1323
02:46:34.565 --> 02:46:35.585
of the Lord?

1324
02:46:37.695 --> 02:46:41.505
That phrase is used at least six times in first

1325
02:46:41.505 --> 02:46:44.905
and second Samuel David inquired of the Lord

1326
02:46:44.905 --> 02:46:46.025
before he stepped into something.

1327
02:46:46.225 --> 02:46:48.025
David inquired of the Lord.

1328
02:46:48.045 --> 02:46:50.585
And that reveals something about David's heart, doesn't it?

1329
02:46:51.645 --> 02:46:54.305
It means his highest priority was knowing

1330
02:46:54.485 --> 02:46:57.185
and obeying God's will with integrity.

1331
02:46:57.645 --> 02:47:01.785
He trusted God. Your will is over my personal ambition.

1332
02:47:02.065 --> 02:47:03.145
I think I could do it this way,

1333
02:47:03.325 --> 02:47:04.585
but God, what do you want me to do?

1334
02:47:04.865 --> 02:47:05.945
I think I wanna go over here.

1335
02:47:06.085 --> 02:47:07.385
God, what do you want me to do?

1336
02:47:08.325 --> 02:47:10.305
And then any authority he walked into,

1337
02:47:10.605 --> 02:47:12.665
he received it from above.

1338
02:47:12.845 --> 02:47:15.385
He received it before he lived it out,

1339
02:47:15.485 --> 02:47:17.825
he responded in submission to the ultimate authority

1340
02:47:17.925 --> 02:47:19.425
and said, okay, God, what do you want?

1341
02:47:19.645 --> 02:47:21.185
I'm giving you my life.

1342
02:47:21.525 --> 02:47:23.305
Is that how you live your life

1343
02:47:26.525 --> 02:47:27.945
before making any decision,

1344
02:47:28.125 --> 02:47:30.345
before stepping forward in any way you

1345
02:47:30.345 --> 02:47:31.465
say, God, what do you want?

1346
02:47:33.095 --> 02:47:34.585
Like Jesus said it this way.

1347
02:47:35.005 --> 02:47:39.145
Do you pray God not my will, but your will be done?

1348
02:47:42.255 --> 02:47:44.075
Is that how we walk into life?

1349
02:47:44.295 --> 02:47:46.355
Are you thinking first

1350
02:47:46.375 --> 02:47:49.555
and foremost, God, your commands are my highest priority?

1351
02:47:50.465 --> 02:47:53.395
Nothing else. God, not my personal ambition, my preference,

1352
02:47:53.515 --> 02:47:55.675
I want your will be done.

1353
02:47:55.975 --> 02:47:58.955
Or are you more focused on personal ambition?

1354
02:47:59.255 --> 02:48:02.835
Are you more focused on saying, I'm gonna go about my way,

1355
02:48:03.175 --> 02:48:04.475
I'm gonna do it this way.

1356
02:48:04.855 --> 02:48:08.155
I'm gonna force my plan rather than wait on God's

1357
02:48:08.155 --> 02:48:09.795
plan and God's timing.

1358
02:48:11.475 --> 02:48:13.335
Listen, I can get there so fast.

1359
02:48:13.775 --> 02:48:17.615
I can go through my life as, as I trust my own intuition.

1360
02:48:17.895 --> 02:48:20.215
I trust my own history, my own knowledge.

1361
02:48:20.335 --> 02:48:24.015
I can go back and lean on everything rather than saying,

1362
02:48:24.015 --> 02:48:26.735
okay, God prayerfully God, what do you want me?

1363
02:48:26.805 --> 02:48:28.375
What? Let me find in your word.

1364
02:48:28.515 --> 02:48:30.135
How do you want me to handle this situation?

1365
02:48:30.275 --> 02:48:31.615
How do you want me to go through my life?

1366
02:48:31.795 --> 02:48:34.135
How would you say I handle this? All of that.

1367
02:48:35.435 --> 02:48:36.735
Is that the way you live your life?

1368
02:48:36.955 --> 02:48:38.695
Or are you just saying, God, I got this.

1369
02:48:39.245 --> 02:48:40.615
I'll see you on the other side.

1370
02:48:44.585 --> 02:48:48.685
And we wonder why we say this is what we believe,

1371
02:48:49.705 --> 02:48:51.365
yet we do this over here.

1372
02:48:54.515 --> 02:48:59.145
This is why. And

1373
02:48:59.145 --> 02:49:02.705
so integrity and integrity is

1374
02:49:02.705 --> 02:49:06.025
where you say something you believe and you do that.

1375
02:49:08.145 --> 02:49:10.365
It matches your public life.

1376
02:49:11.125 --> 02:49:13.085
Testimony matches your private life.

1377
02:49:14.425 --> 02:49:16.285
What's the environment that that grows in?

1378
02:49:16.595 --> 02:49:20.445
It's this attitude where you seek God's will above your own.

1379
02:49:20.505 --> 02:49:23.245
You submit to his leadership

1380
02:49:23.665 --> 02:49:27.445
and he in that process, he makes you more like Jesus.

1381
02:49:28.465 --> 02:49:32.205
If you've just woken up every morning and said, not my will,

1382
02:49:32.205 --> 02:49:36.165
but yours be done in that temptation on Friday night,

1383
02:49:36.505 --> 02:49:39.125
not my will but yours be done in that moment.

1384
02:49:39.185 --> 02:49:40.325
You have to make a decision of

1385
02:49:40.325 --> 02:49:41.885
where you're gonna spend your life.

1386
02:49:42.345 --> 02:49:46.205
Not my will but yours be done, right? That's the the choice.

1387
02:49:46.665 --> 02:49:50.045
Day by day moment by moment, not my will, but yours be done.

1388
02:49:50.105 --> 02:49:52.605
And as you do that in small ways,

1389
02:49:55.165 --> 02:49:59.835
God prepares you for the bigger things, just like he did

1390
02:49:59.835 --> 02:50:00.195
with David

1391
02:50:05.665 --> 02:50:06.965
so far here in first

1392
02:50:06.985 --> 02:50:08.765
and second Samuel, we've watched David

1393
02:50:08.865 --> 02:50:09.925
do all that pretty well.

1394
02:50:11.895 --> 02:50:15.385
He's been a good example, how to love our enemies.

1395
02:50:16.915 --> 02:50:18.535
How to live with an eternal mindset.

1396
02:50:18.835 --> 02:50:20.855
How to, how to live and lead with integrity.

1397
02:50:21.565 --> 02:50:23.015
He's been a good example.

1398
02:50:23.425 --> 02:50:27.615
Sadly, that won't be true for much longer.

1399
02:50:31.995 --> 02:50:34.695
You may remember Adam and Eve's story in the Garden of Eden.

1400
02:50:37.315 --> 02:50:38.375
Two chapters were great.

1401
02:50:40.645 --> 02:50:43.295
Chapter three, everything falls apart.

1402
02:50:46.465 --> 02:50:49.565
It doesn't take much time for David

1403
02:50:50.545 --> 02:50:53.925
to fall into similar traps that Saul

1404
02:50:54.625 --> 02:50:56.485
and many others did.

1405
02:50:59.605 --> 02:51:03.395
Which leads us back to the overall point of these books.

1406
02:51:06.925 --> 02:51:09.595
David is a good example of a man after God's own heart.

1407
02:51:10.825 --> 02:51:13.435
He's a great king, Israel's greatest king.

1408
02:51:14.055 --> 02:51:15.275
But hear this,

1409
02:51:16.125 --> 02:51:19.235
David is not the hero of this story.

1410
02:51:24.905 --> 02:51:26.075
He's merely a pointer

1411
02:51:27.615 --> 02:51:30.355
to the true hero.

1412
02:51:32.015 --> 02:51:34.635
The one who fulfilled what David could only

1413
02:51:35.355 --> 02:51:37.035
resemble Jesus Christ.

1414
02:51:39.735 --> 02:51:43.955
See David, Jesus fulfilled what David could only

1415
02:51:44.665 --> 02:51:47.715
bear some resemblance to he.

1416
02:51:47.735 --> 02:51:49.835
He looked a little bit like the Savior.

1417
02:51:50.255 --> 02:51:52.755
He lived a little bit like the Messiah.

1418
02:51:53.175 --> 02:51:56.755
He was in many ways a type of the Christ,

1419
02:51:57.135 --> 02:51:58.595
the Savior to come.

1420
02:51:58.895 --> 02:52:01.475
He teaches us a whole lot about the Messiah.

1421
02:52:01.475 --> 02:52:05.035
That's why this Messiah is called the Son of David, partly

1422
02:52:05.245 --> 02:52:07.445
because of how David exemplified it.

1423
02:52:07.465 --> 02:52:10.445
And of course through David's line, the Messiah came,

1424
02:52:10.905 --> 02:52:14.605
yet there was a greater king to come from David,

1425
02:52:18.305 --> 02:52:20.805
the perfect king, the one who fulfilled,

1426
02:52:20.865 --> 02:52:23.765
who did in full everything that David could only do.

1427
02:52:23.825 --> 02:52:26.565
In part who David only modeled,

1428
02:52:26.585 --> 02:52:28.365
who David only did imperfectly.

1429
02:52:28.625 --> 02:52:32.405
He was able to do it perfectly, fully and fulfill it all.

1430
02:52:32.555 --> 02:52:36.685
Just think about how Jesus is the greater David, right?

1431
02:52:36.685 --> 02:52:40.355
Listen, Jesus loved his enemies, not just

1432
02:52:40.415 --> 02:52:44.635
by grieving over them, but by actually dying for them.

1433
02:52:47.435 --> 02:52:51.465
Jesus sought his father's will perfectly, even in the Garden

1434
02:52:51.465 --> 02:52:56.065
of Eden, with the cross facing him the next day, Jesus said,

1435
02:52:56.085 --> 02:52:57.505
not my will, but yours be done.

1436
02:53:00.555 --> 02:53:02.465
Jesus led with complete transparency

1437
02:53:02.565 --> 02:53:04.505
and integrity every moment of his life.

1438
02:53:04.505 --> 02:53:07.625
Hebrews four 15, we do not have a high priest who's unable

1439
02:53:07.625 --> 02:53:09.065
to sympathize with our weaknesses,

1440
02:53:09.365 --> 02:53:12.265
but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are

1441
02:53:12.765 --> 02:53:14.625
yet without sin.

1442
02:53:17.955 --> 02:53:19.735
And because of that, through his death

1443
02:53:19.835 --> 02:53:24.255
and resurrection, he ended the ultimate division between God

1444
02:53:24.675 --> 02:53:28.815
and sinners, bringing lost humanity back

1445
02:53:28.835 --> 02:53:31.575
to himself, back home to the Father.

1446
02:53:31.875 --> 02:53:33.295
That's what Jesus did.

1447
02:53:33.555 --> 02:53:36.695
The chaos David led through Jesus led through ultimate chaos

1448
02:53:37.035 --> 02:53:39.175
and he brought his people back to himself.

1449
02:53:41.745 --> 02:53:42.955
This is the greater king.

1450
02:53:43.505 --> 02:53:45.715
This is the Promised King,

1451
02:53:46.885 --> 02:53:48.705
the one we worship here today.

1452
02:53:48.765 --> 02:53:50.785
All praise to that true king Jesus Christ.

1453
02:53:50.795 --> 02:53:51.545
Let's pray together.

1454
02:53:59.225 --> 02:54:02.575
Lord, this is your word. Thank you for showing us

1455
02:54:02.755 --> 02:54:04.295
who you are through it

1456
02:54:05.395 --> 02:54:07.175
and showing us a little bit about ourselves.

1457
02:54:07.195 --> 02:54:09.215
And so, God, I pray right now for us that

1458
02:54:10.825 --> 02:54:14.575
There may be somebody walking in here today who was looking

1459
02:54:14.675 --> 02:54:18.675
for a king, and they've been looking

1460
02:54:18.695 --> 02:54:21.675
for a king in this world, in their own self, over

1461
02:54:21.735 --> 02:54:22.755
and over and over.

1462
02:54:23.815 --> 02:54:25.795
And they've always been disappointed

1463
02:54:28.095 --> 02:54:30.065
because those kings will always fail us.

1464
02:54:32.925 --> 02:54:35.105
Or maybe they've been looking for the way that they could.

1465
02:54:35.295 --> 02:54:36.705
They could live it out themselves.

1466
02:54:37.135 --> 02:54:38.345
They could be their own king.

1467
02:54:38.345 --> 02:54:41.185
They could live it out perfectly enough to be able

1468
02:54:41.185 --> 02:54:43.985
to be surely brought into heaven someday.

1469
02:54:46.365 --> 02:54:49.545
But God, you've shown us and shown them they can't.

1470
02:54:52.645 --> 02:54:55.145
God, we need a savior king

1471
02:54:57.725 --> 02:55:00.945
and praise you, God, that you did it for us.

1472
02:55:03.785 --> 02:55:05.925
And so may we worship with that in mind.

1473
02:55:06.065 --> 02:55:09.485
May we respond to you with that in mind.

1474
02:55:10.265 --> 02:55:12.645
In Jesus' name, amen.

1475
02:55:14.555 --> 02:55:16.725
Part of that response will be the Lord's supper today.

1476
02:55:16.785 --> 02:55:18.365
So invite Chris, one of our elders to,

1477
02:55:18.385 --> 02:55:19.405
uh, lead us through that time.

1478
02:55:22.055 --> 02:55:26.285
Thank you John. We do get the honor

1479
02:55:26.345 --> 02:55:28.125
and the privilege of celebrating the

1480
02:55:28.125 --> 02:55:29.405
Lord's Supper together this morning.

1481
02:55:30.345 --> 02:55:32.245
And, uh, what a beautiful thing this is that we get

1482
02:55:32.245 --> 02:55:33.325
to do as a church.

1483
02:55:33.665 --> 02:55:37.245
Um, remembering Jesus and what he has accomplished,

1484
02:55:37.245 --> 02:55:41.525
and one for us, what he has won in the victory for himself.

1485
02:55:42.385 --> 02:55:46.285
Um, and then looking forward, um, to him returning and,

1486
02:55:46.705 --> 02:55:51.005
and, uh, finishing the work that he began, uh,

1487
02:55:51.065 --> 02:55:53.365
if you are helping with serving the elements of the Lord.

1488
02:55:53.365 --> 02:55:54.445
So I invite you to go ahead

1489
02:55:54.445 --> 02:55:56.125
and, uh, make your way to start serving those,

1490
02:55:56.125 --> 02:55:57.285
passing out the trays.

1491
02:56:00.025 --> 02:56:02.565
And as they are working on, uh,

1492
02:56:02.565 --> 02:56:06.005
passing out those elements this morning, scripture tells us

1493
02:56:06.145 --> 02:56:08.565
to, uh, make this a time

1494
02:56:08.905 --> 02:56:11.245
of reflection to search ourselves.

1495
02:56:11.385 --> 02:56:16.285
And one, it tells us to look if there's any, um, anything

1496
02:56:16.285 --> 02:56:18.405
that's keeping us any sin that's keeping us,

1497
02:56:18.405 --> 02:56:22.045
especially within the body, uh, from, from, uh,

1498
02:56:22.045 --> 02:56:24.565
being in perfect unity with one another, if there's anything

1499
02:56:24.565 --> 02:56:28.365
that's causing this, uh, harmony

1500
02:56:28.665 --> 02:56:30.845
to not exist in the body, to deal with that,

1501
02:56:31.745 --> 02:56:34.005
or if there's unrepentant sin in our hearts

1502
02:56:34.025 --> 02:56:35.245
to deal with that.

1503
02:56:36.145 --> 02:56:40.085
And as also this is something for believers, for disciples

1504
02:56:40.145 --> 02:56:41.165
of Jesus to do.

1505
02:56:41.705 --> 02:56:44.405
Um, if you are not yet a disciple of Jesus

1506
02:56:44.705 --> 02:56:47.525
and not a believer or part of his family, invite you

1507
02:56:47.525 --> 02:56:49.245
to just go ahead and pass those trays on

1508
02:56:49.705 --> 02:56:53.565
and take this time as we all consider together.

1509
02:56:53.795 --> 02:56:56.405
Look inside, make sure there's nothing

1510
02:56:56.405 --> 02:56:59.125
that's unrepented in ourselves as we take this together.

1511
02:57:06.665 --> 02:57:07.805
So this is something that we do

1512
02:57:09.235 --> 02:57:10.885
because Jesus commands us to,

1513
02:57:12.705 --> 02:57:14.405
and it's a good thing that he does

1514
02:57:14.405 --> 02:57:18.965
because it, it reminds us of what he instituted

1515
02:57:18.965 --> 02:57:23.725
with his disciples on the night that he was betrayed just

1516
02:57:23.725 --> 02:57:24.805
before going to the cross.

1517
02:57:26.985 --> 02:57:29.885
Two, one, unite them together, remind them that it's going

1518
02:57:29.885 --> 02:57:32.005
to get hard, it's going to be rough,

1519
02:57:32.185 --> 02:57:34.645
but these are the things that hold you together.

1520
02:57:34.825 --> 02:57:38.485
The fact that I am, I'm laying down my life for you

1521
02:57:38.505 --> 02:57:41.085
and purchasing you as my body.

1522
02:57:41.825 --> 02:57:43.685
So we get to do that together this morning,

1523
02:57:44.185 --> 02:57:46.925
but also forces us to not just look in or look to the past,

1524
02:57:47.585 --> 02:57:48.885
but to look up at Jesus

1525
02:57:48.945 --> 02:57:52.085
and recognize that he is sitting on the throne today

1526
02:57:52.825 --> 02:57:55.525
and he is sitting in victory over sin and death.

1527
02:57:56.585 --> 02:57:59.845
And it also causes us to look forward to his return

1528
02:58:00.375 --> 02:58:03.205
where he is coming back for his bride, his church,

1529
02:58:04.105 --> 02:58:05.605
and he's making all things new.

1530
02:58:05.605 --> 02:58:09.005
And so we get to celebrate that together as a church.

1531
02:58:09.465 --> 02:58:11.365
And then finally, it causes us to look

1532
02:58:11.365 --> 02:58:12.605
around at one another.

1533
02:58:12.905 --> 02:58:16.325
And oftentimes we spend this time praying, which we should

1534
02:58:16.345 --> 02:58:19.525
and looking inward, but also look around, look

1535
02:58:19.525 --> 02:58:22.965
around at everyone in this room that we are

1536
02:58:23.715 --> 02:58:25.165
Jesus's body, his church.

1537
02:58:25.345 --> 02:58:27.845
And this is a communal thing. We're eating a meal together.

1538
02:58:28.345 --> 02:58:31.485
And let's celebrate this together, realizing that all

1539
02:58:31.485 --> 02:58:33.605
of this is for the glory of Jesus.

1540
02:58:36.905 --> 02:58:39.165
So as you have your elements, we're gonna read

1541
02:58:39.505 --> 02:58:42.325
as Paul instructs us to do it in first Corinthians 11,

1542
02:58:43.705 --> 02:58:46.565
the reminder of why we do this together as his people.

1543
02:58:48.795 --> 02:58:52.205
Paul says, for our received from the Lord Jesus,

1544
02:58:52.835 --> 02:58:54.245
what I also deliver to you

1545
02:58:55.955 --> 02:58:58.525
that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed,

1546
02:58:58.525 --> 02:58:59.525
he took bread.

1547
02:59:00.345 --> 02:59:02.405
And when he had given thanks, he broke it

1548
02:59:02.465 --> 02:59:05.885
and said, this is my body, which is for you.

1549
02:59:06.665 --> 02:59:08.405
Do this in remembrance of me.

1550
02:59:08.425 --> 02:59:09.805
So let's take the bread together.

1551
02:59:18.985 --> 02:59:22.525
And he says in the same way, also, he took the cup

1552
02:59:22.935 --> 02:59:24.165
after supper saying,

1553
02:59:25.035 --> 02:59:27.365
this cup is the new covenant in my blood.

1554
02:59:28.585 --> 02:59:32.245
Do this as often as you drink it and remembrance of me.

1555
02:59:32.385 --> 02:59:34.765
So let's take the cup in remembrance of Jesus.

1556
02:59:38.585 --> 02:59:41.805
And finally it says, for as often as you eat this bread

1557
02:59:41.825 --> 02:59:44.445
and drink this cup, you proclaim

1558
02:59:45.185 --> 02:59:46.885
the Lord's death until he comes.

1559
02:59:46.885 --> 02:59:48.085
And so that's what we've done this morning.

1560
02:59:48.615 --> 02:59:50.965
We've proclaimed Jesus' death

1561
02:59:51.065 --> 02:59:53.565
and his resurrection, recognizing

1562
02:59:53.565 --> 02:59:55.005
that he's coming back for his people.

1563
02:59:56.265 --> 02:59:58.885
So let's pray together as we recognize this morning.

1564
02:59:59.175 --> 03:00:04.005
Jesus, thank you first

1565
03:00:04.005 --> 03:00:08.605
of all for saving us, for your sacrifice, for giving us

1566
03:00:09.275 --> 03:00:13.965
your body and pouring your blood for us.

1567
03:00:16.095 --> 03:00:18.285
Thank you for redeeming a people, for yourself,

1568
03:00:19.025 --> 03:00:21.685
for creating unity amongst people

1569
03:00:21.685 --> 03:00:24.445
that have no business being in unity with one another.

1570
03:00:24.825 --> 03:00:27.365
But we are unified by you, Jesus, and your spirit.

1571
03:00:28.585 --> 03:00:31.645
And thank you for the the glorious promise that we have

1572
03:00:31.645 --> 03:00:33.405
of your return to make all things new.

1573
03:00:33.465 --> 03:00:36.525
One day. God, we submit to you, we love you,

1574
03:00:36.525 --> 03:00:39.245
and we thank you this morning, it's in your naming prayer,

1575
03:00:40.225 --> 03:00:43.085
and invite you to stand with us as we continue

1576
03:00:43.085 --> 03:00:44.565
to worship our Jesus this morning.

1577
03:00:58.045 --> 03:00:59.085
Sing to our king, who

1578
03:01:18.465 --> 03:01:19.245
and all,

1579
03:01:48.355 --> 03:01:48.975
And to

1580
03:03:32.245 --> 03:03:33.305
To the greater king.

1581
03:03:33.515 --> 03:03:37.105
Jesus, the one that is deserving of all praise.

1582
03:03:37.805 --> 03:03:40.865
Um, we sing these phrases of day and night.

1583
03:03:40.865 --> 03:03:42.785
Night and day, let incense rise.

1584
03:03:42.895 --> 03:03:44.265
It's the praise that we are giving

1585
03:03:44.285 --> 03:03:45.505
to him because he deserves it.

1586
03:03:47.325 --> 03:03:49.145
So as repeat, repeat this phrase.

1587
03:03:50.455 --> 03:03:54.465
Give him your adoration day

1588
03:03:56.285 --> 03:03:59.485
and incense rise,

1589
03:04:01.265 --> 03:04:03.285
day and night, night

1590
03:04:03.385 --> 03:04:06.485
and David incense rise,

1591
03:04:08.265 --> 03:04:10.165
day and night,

1592
03:04:12.875 --> 03:04:15.485
rise day.

1593
03:04:15.625 --> 03:04:15.845
And

1594
03:05:30.775 --> 03:05:35.625
give him your praise for you.

1595
03:05:38.555 --> 03:05:38.905
Enter

1596
03:05:49.645 --> 03:05:52.025
you of it all

1597
03:05:57.165 --> 03:05:59.305
you of it all

1598
03:06:05.265 --> 03:06:05.485
you.

1599
03:06:12.905 --> 03:06:14.805
You deserve the glory

1600
03:06:22.905 --> 03:06:25.245

You know,

1669
03:29:20.675 --> 03:29:22.405
Welcome to Henderson Hills.

1670
03:29:24.945 --> 03:29:27.965
We are disciple makers, anchored in truth, compelled

1671
03:29:27.965 --> 03:29:30.165
by love, and desperately dependent on the Lord.

1672
03:29:32.305 --> 03:29:34.245
We are generous with what God has given us,

1673
03:29:34.665 --> 03:29:36.885
and we share life giving help with those around us.

1674
03:29:39.345 --> 03:29:42.005
Our mission is to equip one another to love Jesus.

1675
03:29:42.265 --> 03:29:44.725
And lip syn, we are glad you're here.

1676
03:29:49.435 --> 03:29:52.085
Well, good morning, church. How are we doing this morning?

1677
03:29:52.185 --> 03:29:56.005
We good? Oh, all right. All right. I'm, uh, I am Chris.

1678
03:29:56.245 --> 03:29:58.645
I get the privilege of serving as one of your elders, uh,

1679
03:29:58.675 --> 03:29:59.725
here at Henderson Hills.

1680
03:30:00.185 --> 03:30:01.765
So glad that you're with us this morning.

1681
03:30:02.225 --> 03:30:05.245
Uh, if you are new, this is, maybe this is your first time

1682
03:30:05.345 --> 03:30:07.725
or maybe you've come for the last couple weeks, uh,

1683
03:30:07.725 --> 03:30:09.485
but you haven't had a chance to really get plugged

1684
03:30:09.485 --> 03:30:10.525
in with anyone here yet.

1685
03:30:10.525 --> 03:30:12.765
What I would encourage you to do is

1686
03:30:12.785 --> 03:30:15.645
to not leave here without shaking at least one person's

1687
03:30:15.645 --> 03:30:17.485
hand, uh, introducing yourself.

1688
03:30:17.485 --> 03:30:19.485
Hopefully someone's already done that for you this morning.

1689
03:30:20.265 --> 03:30:24.565
And another really easy way to do that is out in the lobby,

1690
03:30:24.565 --> 03:30:25.725
there is a new here desk.

1691
03:30:26.065 --> 03:30:29.125
Uh, go out there after the service, uh,

1692
03:30:29.235 --> 03:30:31.005
meet someone out there at the new hair desk,

1693
03:30:31.025 --> 03:30:33.005
and they will get you plugged in with a little bit

1694
03:30:33.005 --> 03:30:34.005
of the life at the church here.

1695
03:30:34.005 --> 03:30:35.165
I'll help you introduce you to

1696
03:30:35.165 --> 03:30:36.565
what we're about here at Henderson Hills.

1697
03:30:37.705 --> 03:30:39.805
And if you have been coming here for maybe a few weeks

1698
03:30:39.865 --> 03:30:42.765
or a few months, and you are interested in diving a little

1699
03:30:42.765 --> 03:30:45.885
bit deeper into the life of Henderson Hills here, uh,

1700
03:30:45.915 --> 03:30:46.965
what I would encourage you

1701
03:30:46.965 --> 03:30:50.365
to do is next week we have a meaningful membership class

1702
03:30:50.435 --> 03:30:52.085
that is happening right after church.

1703
03:30:52.505 --> 03:30:54.805
So I'd encourage you to get signed up for that

1704
03:30:54.865 --> 03:30:57.325
and be a part of our meaningful membership, uh,

1705
03:30:57.595 --> 03:30:59.445
work workshop or class, uh,

1706
03:30:59.585 --> 03:31:01.325
to learn a little bit more about Henderson Hills,

1707
03:31:01.385 --> 03:31:03.325
who we are, what we believe, uh,

1708
03:31:03.345 --> 03:31:05.205
and then what we're about here is serving Jesus.

1709
03:31:05.665 --> 03:31:08.325
Uh, so be a part of that. And then finally, uh,

1710
03:31:08.345 --> 03:31:11.365
the last thing I want to announce this morning is if you are

1711
03:31:11.365 --> 03:31:13.685
looking for a place to serve here at Henderson Hills,

1712
03:31:14.395 --> 03:31:17.685
perhaps, uh, you have some musical ability.

1713
03:31:17.825 --> 03:31:19.965
You sing, you play an instrument,

1714
03:31:20.505 --> 03:31:22.605
or you're really interested in learning

1715
03:31:22.625 --> 03:31:25.325
and participating in how the, uh, the lights

1716
03:31:25.385 --> 03:31:27.845
and the audio visual, the cameras, all of

1717
03:31:27.845 --> 03:31:29.325
that happens here at Henderson Hills.

1718
03:31:29.555 --> 03:31:31.325
What I would encourage you to do is come

1719
03:31:31.325 --> 03:31:34.845
to a worship ministry interest lunch next week

1720
03:31:35.025 --> 03:31:36.445
as well, right after the service.

1721
03:31:37.105 --> 03:31:38.605
Uh, I think it's gonna be done in the offices.

1722
03:31:38.835 --> 03:31:40.005
Come to that, uh,

1723
03:31:40.005 --> 03:31:42.245
learn a bit about our worship ministry here

1724
03:31:42.245 --> 03:31:43.765
and how you can get involved there.

1725
03:31:43.915 --> 03:31:45.885
There's also some staff out in the lobby

1726
03:31:46.415 --> 03:31:48.245
afterwards if you want to just talk to them

1727
03:31:48.245 --> 03:31:50.325
and learn more about what that looks like here.

1728
03:31:51.705 --> 03:31:54.565
So finally, what I want us to do is to stand up

1729
03:31:54.585 --> 03:31:57.005
and let's spend a little bit of time greeting one another,

1730
03:31:57.075 --> 03:31:58.205
fellowshiping together.

1731
03:31:58.425 --> 03:32:00.005
And I'll ask you this question.

1732
03:32:00.505 --> 03:32:02.085
Should we include a banjo

1733
03:32:02.225 --> 03:32:04.845
or a harmonica in our worship ministry here?

1734
03:33:36.545 --> 03:33:39.005
Well, I, I hate to end the conversations early.

1735
03:33:39.505 --> 03:33:41.285
Um, but hopefully you can pick those back up

1736
03:33:41.285 --> 03:33:43.685
after the service, pick up where, where you were.

1737
03:33:44.745 --> 03:33:46.085
Uh, I'd encourage you all to go ahead

1738
03:33:46.085 --> 03:33:47.205
and make your way back to your seats.

1739
03:33:47.255 --> 03:33:49.885
We're going to, uh, begin our time of worship

1740
03:33:50.525 --> 03:33:53.325
together here singing, and we're singing a new

1741
03:33:53.325 --> 03:33:54.565
song here this morning.

1742
03:33:54.565 --> 03:33:55.725
Now, we haven't sung before,

1743
03:33:56.665 --> 03:33:58.165
but in this song that we're singing,

1744
03:33:58.505 --> 03:33:59.925
we ask the question over

1745
03:33:59.945 --> 03:34:03.365
and over again, who is like the Lord, who is like Jesus,

1746
03:34:03.915 --> 03:34:05.765
this, this God that we serve.

1747
03:34:06.945 --> 03:34:09.525
And to help us consider that a little bit this morning,

1748
03:34:09.665 --> 03:34:11.485
I'm gonna read from Psalm one 13.

1749
03:34:11.945 --> 03:34:13.005
I'm gonna start in verse four.

1750
03:34:13.955 --> 03:34:16.325
It's gonna talk about who this God is that we serve.

1751
03:34:16.905 --> 03:34:18.445
So lemme read that for us this morning.

1752
03:34:19.845 --> 03:34:22.445
Starting in verse four, says, the Lord is high

1753
03:34:22.575 --> 03:34:26.805
above all nations and his glory above the heavens.

1754
03:34:27.985 --> 03:34:31.445
Who is like the Lord our God, who is seated on high,

1755
03:34:32.665 --> 03:34:35.165
who looks far down on the heavens and the earth,

1756
03:34:36.265 --> 03:34:39.285
and hear this, he raises the poor from the dust,

1757
03:34:40.185 --> 03:34:44.045
and he lifts the needy from the ash heep to make them sit

1758
03:34:44.045 --> 03:34:46.685
with princes, with the princes of his people.

1759
03:34:48.105 --> 03:34:50.045
He gives the barren woman a home,

1760
03:34:50.945 --> 03:34:53.405
making her the joyous mother of children.

1761
03:34:54.025 --> 03:34:55.245
Praise the Lord.

1762
03:34:56.185 --> 03:34:57.765
So this morning, that's what we're gonna do.

1763
03:34:57.855 --> 03:34:59.045
We're gonna praise the Lord,

1764
03:34:59.065 --> 03:35:02.725
and we're gonna consider who God is, who this Jesus is,

1765
03:35:03.025 --> 03:35:05.565
and all the things that are unique about him.

1766
03:35:05.585 --> 03:35:06.765
And as we consider those things,

1767
03:35:06.775 --> 03:35:09.925
we're just gonna result in this joyous praise

1768
03:35:09.945 --> 03:35:11.005
of who Jesus is.

1769
03:35:11.585 --> 03:35:13.805
So let's sing this song together this morning.

1770
03:35:13.825 --> 03:35:14.825
In praise of Jesus,

1771
03:35:28.455 --> 03:35:30.285
There was creation.

1772
03:35:32.985 --> 03:35:35.285
Who illuminates the stars?

1773
03:35:38.825 --> 03:35:42.125
Who has said eter in the ocean?

1774
03:35:43.545 --> 03:35:45.045
Oh, there just

1775
03:35:51.625 --> 03:35:52.565
can, the

1776
03:35:57.745 --> 03:35:59.245
can dark.

1777
03:36:03.425 --> 03:36:07.165
Who can? The curse generations

1778
03:36:58.945 --> 03:36:59.165
Who

1779
03:37:48.785 --> 03:37:53.485
you are the one who king the Lord over everything.

1780
03:37:54.575 --> 03:37:58.005
Jesus. There is no Father Jesus.

1781
03:37:58.455 --> 03:37:59.845
There is no Father.

1782
03:38:00.915 --> 03:38:02.725
Your world will never change

1783
03:38:03.235 --> 03:38:06.965
because your name is here to say Jesus.

1784
03:38:07.495 --> 03:38:08.525
There is no

1785
03:38:16.315 --> 03:38:17.315
Lord.

1786
03:39:28.745 --> 03:39:32.795
Celebrate who? He's no one

1787
03:39:32.795 --> 03:39:33.795
Like him. Let's

1788
03:39:33.795 --> 03:39:34.765
praise him this morning.

1789
03:39:36.345 --> 03:39:38.005
Yes, in light of who God is,

1790
03:39:38.225 --> 03:39:39.805
we have a story to tell, right?

1791
03:39:40.425 --> 03:39:43.285
He has done Good work in our lives if we are his child.

1792
03:39:43.385 --> 03:39:44.925
So let's proclaim the good work

1793
03:39:44.925 --> 03:39:46.245
that he's done in our life today.

1794
03:39:53.195 --> 03:39:57.365
When I was lost alone, your

1795
03:39:57.885 --> 03:40:00.565
presence was where I found home.

1796
03:40:01.785 --> 03:40:02.765
You were there

1797
03:40:09.975 --> 03:40:12.645
every high, every

1798
03:40:14.065 --> 03:40:17.365
you never without hope.

1799
03:40:31.345 --> 03:40:32.005
You breathe

1800
03:41:04.985 --> 03:41:09.765
throne down your life

1801
03:41:10.505 --> 03:41:11.765
to rescue us.

1802
03:41:17.395 --> 03:41:18.165
News that we can.

1803
03:42:24.545 --> 03:42:24.885
I'm gonna

1804
03:42:25.045 --> 03:42:26.325
Sing about all the good things

1805
03:42:26.325 --> 03:42:27.725
that he has done in our lives.

1806
03:42:28.055 --> 03:42:30.845
These characteristics of are true about who he

1807
03:42:30.845 --> 03:42:31.845
Is. Let's sing this out.

1808
03:42:31.845 --> 03:42:31.885

1809
03:42:36.225 --> 03:42:38.445
You are good. And I've witnessed it.

1810
03:42:40.385 --> 03:42:42.645
You are strong, and I've witnessed it.

1811
03:42:44.545 --> 03:42:46.525
You are constant. I've witnessed it,

1812
03:42:47.425 --> 03:42:50.565
and I'm confident I'll see.

1813
03:42:51.745 --> 03:42:54.325
And you and I,

1814
03:45:45.635 --> 03:45:46.635
Amen.

1815
03:45:49.425 --> 03:45:52.325
God, you are worthy. God, you are constant.

1816
03:45:52.345 --> 03:45:53.805
You are never changing God.

1817
03:45:54.115 --> 03:45:56.645
Even when our circumstances look different, God,

1818
03:45:56.665 --> 03:45:57.885
you are always the same.

1819
03:45:58.525 --> 03:45:59.765
I thank you for your faithfulness.

1820
03:45:59.985 --> 03:46:01.045
God, I thank you for the things

1821
03:46:01.045 --> 03:46:02.045
that you've done in our lives

1822
03:46:02.065 --> 03:46:03.765
and the ways you are continuing to work.

1823
03:46:04.865 --> 03:46:07.725
God, may we never forget that you are above it all.

1824
03:46:07.785 --> 03:46:10.605
God, you reign above it all and you are worthy. Amen.

1825
03:46:11.225 --> 03:46:12.225
You may be seated.

1826
03:46:33.245 --> 03:46:34.615
Well, good morning, church.

1827
03:46:34.795 --> 03:46:38.055
It is great to gather together like this every week.

1828
03:46:38.155 --> 03:46:39.815
Uh, my name's John, one of the pastors here.

1829
03:46:39.815 --> 03:46:40.855
I get to preach most of the time.

1830
03:46:40.875 --> 03:46:42.495
If I haven't met you yet, I'd love

1831
03:46:42.495 --> 03:46:43.735
to meet you sometime soon.

1832
03:46:44.195 --> 03:46:45.935
So just come say hi. When you see me.

1833
03:46:46.285 --> 03:46:47.495
Today's a really special day.

1834
03:46:47.555 --> 03:46:49.535
We are kicking off a new sermon series,

1835
03:46:49.995 --> 03:46:51.615
and we're gonna walk through the book

1836
03:46:51.715 --> 03:46:54.855
of Second Samuel over the next couple months.

1837
03:46:55.605 --> 03:46:57.975
Last fall and spring, we walk

1838
03:46:57.975 --> 03:46:59.335
through the book of First Samuel.

1839
03:46:59.795 --> 03:47:01.295
And so that began the story.

1840
03:47:01.395 --> 03:47:04.255
Now we're going to kind of continue the story

1841
03:47:04.325 --> 03:47:05.695
through the book of Second Samuel.

1842
03:47:06.245 --> 03:47:09.895
Last week, Aaron, well reminded us that really the whole

1843
03:47:10.705 --> 03:47:12.975
story has been about God's people

1844
03:47:13.905 --> 03:47:15.895
abandoning God as their king.

1845
03:47:16.475 --> 03:47:18.895
Uh, that's really the whole genesis of the story, is

1846
03:47:18.895 --> 03:47:21.575
that they were searching instead of following God,

1847
03:47:21.575 --> 03:47:23.215
they were searching for an earthly king.

1848
03:47:23.675 --> 03:47:27.695
And that has not gone well for them. And so they did that.

1849
03:47:27.885 --> 03:47:30.535
That was really the premise of it was, who shall reign?

1850
03:47:30.535 --> 03:47:33.135
It really should be God. But the, the secondary question

1851
03:47:33.135 --> 03:47:34.935
with that was then, well, okay, if they're searching

1852
03:47:34.935 --> 03:47:36.615
for an earthly king, who's gonna be that king?

1853
03:47:37.755 --> 03:47:39.815
And then it was the process of figuring out

1854
03:47:40.075 --> 03:47:44.855
who God had promised this type of man to lead the country.

1855
03:47:45.395 --> 03:47:46.815
But they had to figure out who that was.

1856
03:47:47.315 --> 03:47:48.935
And so we showed this chart, maybe some

1857
03:47:48.935 --> 03:47:52.015
of you remember this throughout the whole of one Samuel,

1858
03:47:52.475 --> 03:47:54.135
and we tracked how that played out.

1859
03:47:54.235 --> 03:47:57.135
And so we saw the transition from judges to kings,

1860
03:47:57.475 --> 03:47:59.815
and then how the development happened

1861
03:47:59.815 --> 03:48:01.535
where the first king was Saul.

1862
03:48:01.755 --> 03:48:02.935
And he looked the part head

1863
03:48:02.935 --> 03:48:04.575
and shoulders above her handsome, right?

1864
03:48:04.605 --> 03:48:07.375
He's the guy. And he, he seemed like he would be the one,

1865
03:48:07.755 --> 03:48:10.215
but his heart was not close to God.

1866
03:48:10.795 --> 03:48:12.455
And so God had promised a man

1867
03:48:12.455 --> 03:48:13.735
after God's own heart to lead his people.

1868
03:48:13.955 --> 03:48:17.775
And that transition from Saul then to David, God,

1869
03:48:17.935 --> 03:48:20.095
anointed David to replace Saul.

1870
03:48:21.085 --> 03:48:23.255
Well, second Samuel, that was first Samuel.

1871
03:48:23.255 --> 03:48:26.255
Second Samuel is David's rise to the throne.

1872
03:48:26.635 --> 03:48:29.685
How he steps into that role, and then how he handles it

1873
03:48:29.895 --> 03:48:32.365
after he steps into that role.

1874
03:48:32.855 --> 03:48:34.925
We're gonna use another chart for second Samuel.

1875
03:48:35.185 --> 03:48:36.845
So you might take a picture of this now.

1876
03:48:36.845 --> 03:48:38.965
We'll have it up every week at some point, usually.

1877
03:48:39.545 --> 03:48:41.125
So, uh, you'll see this a couple times,

1878
03:48:41.145 --> 03:48:43.965
but it's gonna be the rise and fall of David.

1879
03:48:44.825 --> 03:48:47.085
Now, the idea is yes, we're gonna learn

1880
03:48:47.085 --> 03:48:49.685
that David was God's promised king for Israel.

1881
03:48:49.745 --> 03:48:51.325
He was the one. But

1882
03:48:54.215 --> 03:48:55.525
we'll also see that David was limited.

1883
03:48:56.505 --> 03:48:57.805
He was the promised king.

1884
03:48:58.265 --> 03:49:00.445
But limited in that role,

1885
03:49:01.565 --> 03:49:03.255
there's gonna be a rise to the throne.

1886
03:49:03.555 --> 03:49:06.935
Yes, there will be, uh, David's, uh, process

1887
03:49:07.155 --> 03:49:09.295
of becoming the greatest King Israel ever had.

1888
03:49:09.315 --> 03:49:11.735
But then there's also gonna be faults

1889
03:49:12.155 --> 03:49:13.775
of David along the way,

1890
03:49:14.395 --> 03:49:18.135
and the consequences that come from those faults.

1891
03:49:19.555 --> 03:49:21.335
See, David is not always the hero

1892
03:49:21.965 --> 03:49:23.535
that we make him out to be.

1893
03:49:25.515 --> 03:49:27.775
In fact, there's some pretty serious issues,

1894
03:49:28.945 --> 03:49:30.535
which really may.

1895
03:49:30.675 --> 03:49:32.215
It means something that we need

1896
03:49:32.215 --> 03:49:34.295
to set up right here at the beginning of the whole series.

1897
03:49:35.125 --> 03:49:38.255
This is something we won't forget, can't forget, is

1898
03:49:38.255 --> 03:49:41.935
that David is merely a pointer

1899
03:49:42.395 --> 03:49:44.535
to the true promised King.

1900
03:49:45.685 --> 03:49:48.055
He's the promised king that, that Israel needed.

1901
03:49:48.555 --> 03:49:51.615
But, but he's really just pointing us forward to the true

1902
03:49:52.695 --> 03:49:55.455
promised King whose name is Jesus.

1903
03:49:56.275 --> 03:49:58.055
That's really what the whole book is about.

1904
03:49:58.195 --> 03:50:00.375
So in one sense, we'll see second Samuel's,

1905
03:50:00.375 --> 03:50:03.375
like David's testimony, his successes, his failures,

1906
03:50:03.635 --> 03:50:05.135
his experiences of God's grace.

1907
03:50:05.435 --> 03:50:07.895
That's a great picture for us to learn from.

1908
03:50:08.315 --> 03:50:11.575
But it's also the main point how all of that

1909
03:50:12.595 --> 03:50:14.535
points us to the Lord.

1910
03:50:15.315 --> 03:50:16.815
And so don't forget that as we go through it.

1911
03:50:16.815 --> 03:50:18.415
That's why I want to begin just by praying

1912
03:50:18.475 --> 03:50:21.415
for this whole series that we're gonna set a tone for this.

1913
03:50:21.415 --> 03:50:24.255
We're gonna ask the Lord to bless it, give us his power

1914
03:50:24.675 --> 03:50:27.615
as we walk through this power, this passage of scripture.

1915
03:50:27.755 --> 03:50:30.735
So, Lord, thank you for the opportunity to study

1916
03:50:31.285 --> 03:50:32.735
through your word.

1917
03:50:32.795 --> 03:50:35.335
And, and we don't, we don't know.

1918
03:50:35.675 --> 03:50:40.305
We don't think this is merely Man's words.

1919
03:50:41.605 --> 03:50:45.945
This is your word. And we know that with that

1920
03:50:47.905 --> 03:50:50.955
Holy Spirit, you empower your word.

1921
03:50:51.895 --> 03:50:54.315
You highlight, you exalt your word.

1922
03:50:54.375 --> 03:50:56.995
And so God, as as we study it over the next couple months,

1923
03:50:57.025 --> 03:51:01.155
this you unique Book of two Samuel Lord, use it to teach us,

1924
03:51:01.255 --> 03:51:02.795
use it to change our hearts and,

1925
03:51:02.895 --> 03:51:05.635
and move us forward to be more like you.

1926
03:51:06.335 --> 03:51:10.555
As we look to the true promised king that we celebrate

1927
03:51:10.555 --> 03:51:13.525
and worship every week, help us guys.

1928
03:51:13.525 --> 03:51:14.965
It's gotta be your work. It's not mine.

1929
03:51:14.985 --> 03:51:18.525
Get us outta the way. Remove distractions that we can see

1930
03:51:18.525 --> 03:51:21.325
what you want us to see in Jesus name.

1931
03:51:21.795 --> 03:51:25.800
Amen. And so I invite you now to turn in your copy

1932
03:51:25.800 --> 03:51:30.445
of God's word to Second Samuel early in the Old Testament.

1933
03:51:30.445 --> 03:51:31.365
You just start from the beginning.

1934
03:51:31.365 --> 03:51:32.525
You start flipping back a little bit.

1935
03:51:32.525 --> 03:51:36.445
You'll find second Samuel, uh, put a bookmark there

1936
03:51:36.505 --> 03:51:38.765
or your, your little ribbon in your Bible,

1937
03:51:38.765 --> 03:51:41.085
because we'll be there every week as we walk

1938
03:51:41.085 --> 03:51:45.005
through this narrative, as you turn there.

1939
03:51:45.005 --> 03:51:46.565
It might seem like as we walk through this,

1940
03:51:46.565 --> 03:51:48.885
that we're taking really big chunks of scripture.

1941
03:51:50.105 --> 03:51:52.525
And and that's partly true because we'll take a two

1942
03:51:52.525 --> 03:51:54.485
or three chapters at a time sometimes.

1943
03:51:54.665 --> 03:51:56.485
And, and that can seem overwhelming.

1944
03:51:56.545 --> 03:51:58.325
But the reality is that's just narrative.

1945
03:51:58.505 --> 03:52:01.765
That's just the, the nature of this. You, you have a story.

1946
03:52:02.625 --> 03:52:04.765
You can't break it up into little sections

1947
03:52:04.765 --> 03:52:06.165
or you lose the point of the story.

1948
03:52:07.105 --> 03:52:10.525
So we have to take bigger sections to understand the point

1949
03:52:11.195 --> 03:52:13.285
that God was trying to reveal here.

1950
03:52:13.385 --> 03:52:15.525
So for example, today we're gonna look at chapters one

1951
03:52:15.525 --> 03:52:18.605
through three, three chapters of two Samuel,

1952
03:52:19.195 --> 03:52:20.885
because part of it recaps

1953
03:52:20.885 --> 03:52:22.765
what we already saw at the end of one Samuel.

1954
03:52:23.225 --> 03:52:25.965
And the rest of it sets up David to be the king

1955
03:52:26.555 --> 03:52:28.005
that we need.

1956
03:52:29.515 --> 03:52:31.615
It sets up David, not just as the king,

1957
03:52:31.615 --> 03:52:36.535
but also the kind of king that God wanted for his people.

1958
03:52:37.235 --> 03:52:39.775
Not a king who would seize power by violence

1959
03:52:39.875 --> 03:52:42.815
or manipulation, but one whose integrity would

1960
03:52:42.865 --> 03:52:43.975
shine really brightly.

1961
03:52:43.975 --> 03:52:46.255
That's what he was saying through these couple chapters.

1962
03:52:46.315 --> 03:52:49.175
God, this God's saying to us, this is the kind of man

1963
03:52:49.805 --> 03:52:51.415
that I want to be the king.

1964
03:52:51.435 --> 03:52:53.815
And we'll see that in David in these chapters.

1965
03:52:53.815 --> 03:52:56.735
How he responds to Saul's death. That's a big test for him.

1966
03:52:57.035 --> 03:53:00.535
But also the division we see among God's people.

1967
03:53:00.685 --> 03:53:01.935
There's a big test there.

1968
03:53:02.555 --> 03:53:04.735
And again, all of it will point us forward

1969
03:53:04.835 --> 03:53:06.575
to the true king Jesus.

1970
03:53:07.675 --> 03:53:10.215
And so let's look now Second Samuel chapter one.

1971
03:53:10.665 --> 03:53:11.895
Again, I can't read all three

1972
03:53:11.895 --> 03:53:13.175
chapters, we just don't have enough time for that.

1973
03:53:13.195 --> 03:53:14.935
But I'm gonna give you highlights, summary statements,

1974
03:53:15.525 --> 03:53:18.335
dive into critical pieces of it and,

1975
03:53:18.395 --> 03:53:20.975
and walk through the story so we're not missing anything.

1976
03:53:21.435 --> 03:53:24.615
And so what wrap, what happens right outta the gate here is,

1977
03:53:25.275 --> 03:53:27.735
is the parallel account of Saul's death.

1978
03:53:27.915 --> 03:53:30.215
The King of Israel has died.

1979
03:53:30.595 --> 03:53:32.695
One Samuel 31 was, was the actual story

1980
03:53:32.715 --> 03:53:34.935
of Saul dying in the battle scene.

1981
03:53:35.285 --> 03:53:37.175
Here. It's David's account.

1982
03:53:37.195 --> 03:53:40.575
And, and David's experience at the same parallel time.

1983
03:53:41.135 --> 03:53:42.735
'cause what was happening, a big battle

1984
03:53:42.735 --> 03:53:43.815
with the Philistines.

1985
03:53:44.505 --> 03:53:46.895
These people were trying to overtake Israel.

1986
03:53:47.165 --> 03:53:49.575
David's in a different part of the country, and Saul

1987
03:53:49.575 --> 03:53:52.095
and his son, Jonathan, who was David's best friend,

1988
03:53:52.115 --> 03:53:53.535
by the way, they were in the battle

1989
03:53:53.995 --> 03:53:56.175
and they ended up dying in the battle.

1990
03:53:57.575 --> 03:53:58.745
Well, here's what happens. One

1991
03:53:58.745 --> 03:54:02.425
of the servants from Saul's camp who was an amalekite,

1992
03:54:02.425 --> 03:54:04.625
which is one of the defeated enemies of God's people,

1993
03:54:05.165 --> 03:54:06.225
he comes to David

1994
03:54:06.605 --> 03:54:09.545
and says, Hey David, listen, I, I'm,

1995
03:54:09.565 --> 03:54:13.305
I'm telling you some news you need to know Saul's died.

1996
03:54:14.265 --> 03:54:15.905
'cause David didn't know there wasn't Snapchat

1997
03:54:15.965 --> 03:54:17.465
or Twitter or anything like that.

1998
03:54:17.465 --> 03:54:19.945
It was just like David needed to find some guy shows up

1999
03:54:19.945 --> 03:54:21.665
and says, Hey, Saul is dead.

2000
03:54:21.765 --> 03:54:22.905
Now here's the thing about this guy.

2001
03:54:23.225 --> 03:54:24.605
He wanted to impress David.

2002
03:54:26.185 --> 03:54:29.205
He was certain in his mind that David would love

2003
03:54:29.205 --> 03:54:32.885
to hear the fact that Saul, his, his enemy, had died.

2004
03:54:34.105 --> 03:54:37.085
And so this man walks in, says, Hey David,

2005
03:54:37.085 --> 03:54:38.525
listen, Saul's dead.

2006
03:54:39.205 --> 03:54:40.925
I got him. I killed him. Them.

2007
03:54:43.885 --> 03:54:47.625
Now that's different than what we read in one Samuel 31.

2008
03:54:48.495 --> 03:54:50.985
It's a dis, it's distinct from that

2009
03:54:50.985 --> 03:54:53.745
because what we read in that is that Saul was

2010
03:54:53.745 --> 03:54:56.185
so badly wounded that he had fell on his own sword

2011
03:54:56.245 --> 03:54:57.505
and died in the battle.

2012
03:54:57.525 --> 03:54:59.745
And so this man walks in this am Malachi

2013
03:54:59.745 --> 03:55:01.265
and says, Hey, I killed him.

2014
03:55:02.135 --> 03:55:05.845
He's lying in order to curry favor

2015
03:55:06.995 --> 03:55:08.165
with the new king.

2016
03:55:08.735 --> 03:55:11.565
Maybe he'll give me a a position in his new

2017
03:55:11.565 --> 03:55:12.725
kingdom or something like that.

2018
03:55:12.985 --> 03:55:17.685
We don't know. But he's clearly lying to impress the king.

2019
03:55:19.645 --> 03:55:22.855
Well, watch how David responded to the news.

2020
03:55:24.125 --> 03:55:26.935
This man came and said, Hey, I got Saul. He's dead.

2021
03:55:27.175 --> 03:55:29.575
I did it. Aren't you proud?

2022
03:55:29.665 --> 03:55:33.535
Watch David's response verses 11 and 12 here in chapter one.

2023
03:55:35.355 --> 03:55:38.205
Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them.

2024
03:55:38.205 --> 03:55:39.445
That's a sign of grief.

2025
03:55:40.265 --> 03:55:42.325
And so did all the men who were with him.

2026
03:55:42.545 --> 03:55:46.605
And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul

2027
03:55:46.605 --> 03:55:49.325
and for Jonathan, his son, and for the people of the Lord

2028
03:55:49.465 --> 03:55:50.605
and for the house of Israel

2029
03:55:50.605 --> 03:55:52.965
because they had fallen by the sword.

2030
03:55:55.355 --> 03:55:58.755
Now, don't forget who Saul was.

2031
03:56:00.145 --> 03:56:04.195
Saul was the man who had multiple times tried to kill David.

2032
03:56:05.285 --> 03:56:07.215
He'd hunted him like a wild animal.

2033
03:56:07.395 --> 03:56:10.295
He had kept him on the run for 10 years. This was the man.

2034
03:56:10.565 --> 03:56:13.915
Saul was the man that we see.

2035
03:56:14.065 --> 03:56:15.955
David's heart show up.

2036
03:56:16.385 --> 03:56:18.675
Saul was the man that David was

2037
03:56:19.715 --> 03:56:22.625
grieving for his loss.

2038
03:56:23.505 --> 03:56:25.355
Instead of hatred, there was grief.

2039
03:56:25.545 --> 03:56:28.435
Instead of rejoicing over his enemy's death,

2040
03:56:28.435 --> 03:56:29.795
there was mourning.

2041
03:56:32.185 --> 03:56:36.615
David grieved the loss of God's anointed king that Saul was.

2042
03:56:39.235 --> 03:56:41.495
He even wrote a song of lament.

2043
03:56:41.495 --> 03:56:43.855
David wrote most of the Psalms, you can go through

2044
03:56:43.855 --> 03:56:45.175
and find his name on a lot of those.

2045
03:56:45.795 --> 03:56:47.815
He wrote a song of lament to be sung

2046
03:56:47.815 --> 03:56:50.215
by God's people over the loss of Saul

2047
03:56:50.355 --> 03:56:52.695
and Jonathan, we find it here in chapter one,

2048
03:56:52.695 --> 03:56:54.095
verses 19 through 27.

2049
03:56:54.395 --> 03:56:55.815
You can read the whole thing. I'm just gonna read

2050
03:56:55.855 --> 03:56:56.895
a couple pieces to show you.

2051
03:56:57.155 --> 03:56:59.175
It says verse 19, your glory,

2052
03:56:59.275 --> 03:57:01.535
Israel is slain on your high places.

2053
03:57:01.795 --> 03:57:03.055
How the mighty have fallen.

2054
03:57:04.785 --> 03:57:07.095
Verse 23, Saul and Jonathan, beloved

2055
03:57:07.155 --> 03:57:08.575
and lovely in life and death.

2056
03:57:08.575 --> 03:57:11.215
They were not divided. They were swifter than eagles,

2057
03:57:11.815 --> 03:57:12.855
stronger than lions.

2058
03:57:13.125 --> 03:57:15.895
He's upholding them. Verse 27, how the mighty have fallen

2059
03:57:16.235 --> 03:57:18.415
and the weapons of war perished.

2060
03:57:19.735 --> 03:57:24.685
So he wrote a song, uh, of grief for the nation to sing.

2061
03:57:27.935 --> 03:57:31.925
Not only that, watch how he responded to the amalekite man

2062
03:57:31.925 --> 03:57:34.365
who came and told him about Saul's death.

2063
03:57:35.075 --> 03:57:36.725
Look at verses 14 through 16.

2064
03:57:40.075 --> 03:57:43.825
David said to him, how is it you were not afraid

2065
03:57:43.845 --> 03:57:46.585
to put out your hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?

2066
03:57:47.905 --> 03:57:49.315
Then David called one of the young men

2067
03:57:49.315 --> 03:57:50.795
and said, go execute him.

2068
03:57:51.295 --> 03:57:53.155
And he struck him down so that he died.

2069
03:57:54.035 --> 03:57:55.695
And David said to the Amalekite, man,

2070
03:57:55.695 --> 03:57:57.295
your blood be on your head

2071
03:57:57.355 --> 03:57:59.935
for your own mouth has testified against you saying,

2072
03:58:00.215 --> 03:58:02.335
I have killed the Lord's anointed.

2073
03:58:04.255 --> 03:58:06.835
He had the man who claimed to have killed Saul.

2074
03:58:06.835 --> 03:58:11.035
He had him executed right like

2075
03:58:13.535 --> 03:58:17.225
this man, this Amalekite man should have recognized the

2076
03:58:17.265 --> 03:58:19.385
sanctity of God's anointed king.

2077
03:58:20.245 --> 03:58:24.795
He should have been terrified to touch him

2078
03:58:24.795 --> 03:58:26.995
because remember, that's what David did when David was

2079
03:58:26.995 --> 03:58:28.915
fleeing from Saul had multiple chances

2080
03:58:28.915 --> 03:58:31.595
to take Saul out instead of Saul trying to kill him.

2081
03:58:31.815 --> 03:58:34.405
He didn't. He said, no, no,

2082
03:58:34.425 --> 03:58:35.765
I'm not gonna touch the Lord's anointed.

2083
03:58:35.765 --> 03:58:37.045
He repeated that multiple times.

2084
03:58:37.385 --> 03:58:39.085
I'm not touching the Lord's anointed.

2085
03:58:39.185 --> 03:58:42.365
I'm not going to gain the throne improperly.

2086
03:58:42.705 --> 03:58:45.165
God promised it to me. I'm not gonna do it myself.

2087
03:58:45.465 --> 03:58:47.165
I'm going to allow God to do it.

2088
03:58:47.275 --> 03:58:50.045
This Amalekite man said a whole different mindset.

2089
03:58:50.355 --> 03:58:52.005
He's like, I'm gonna manipulate this whole

2090
03:58:52.405 --> 03:58:53.645
situation to my ends.

2091
03:58:54.665 --> 03:58:57.625
And what happened? He paid the ultimate price.

2092
03:59:01.365 --> 03:59:05.905
So here's the point. David revealed his heart

2093
03:59:06.285 --> 03:59:08.545
in his response to Saul's death.

2094
03:59:09.645 --> 03:59:10.665
That's what we see here.

2095
03:59:13.495 --> 03:59:17.845
David revealed his passionate love for God,

2096
03:59:18.765 --> 03:59:19.925
a man after God's own heart.

2097
03:59:19.935 --> 03:59:23.045
David revealed that here by the way.

2098
03:59:23.145 --> 03:59:27.325
He responded to his enemy, Saul dying.

2099
03:59:31.025 --> 03:59:32.425
'cause he could have. Think about it.

2100
03:59:33.165 --> 03:59:34.945
He could have rejoiced that. Saul's gone.

2101
03:59:35.045 --> 03:59:38.705
My opponent is gone. The pathway to the throne is clear.

2102
03:59:38.885 --> 03:59:42.105
Now I got this. I'm king. Now it's clear.

2103
03:59:42.325 --> 03:59:43.185
But he doesn't do that.

2104
03:59:47.825 --> 03:59:50.735
Which leads us to a question for us today.

2105
03:59:52.885 --> 03:59:55.345
Is that how you love your enemies?

2106
04:00:00.625 --> 04:00:04.715
Like do you grieve when your enemy suffers?

2107
04:00:07.515 --> 04:00:12.265
If your opponent or the antagonist in your life dies?

2108
04:00:13.125 --> 04:00:15.265
Do you mourn for their death?

2109
04:00:19.075 --> 04:00:20.615
Or are you more apt to throw a party

2110
04:00:20.685 --> 04:00:21.855
like, man, they deserved it.

2111
04:00:21.855 --> 04:00:23.175
They got what they deserve. Finally,

2112
04:00:26.515 --> 04:00:29.695
and listen, we saw this as we studied Romans 12 this summer,

2113
04:00:30.355 --> 04:00:35.035
one of the most challenging realignment statements in

2114
04:00:35.035 --> 04:00:38.665
Romans 12 verses 19 and 20.

2115
04:00:39.095 --> 04:00:41.465
Beloved never avenge yourselves,

2116
04:00:42.895 --> 04:00:44.555
but leave it to the wrath of God.

2117
04:00:44.975 --> 04:00:46.835
For it is written, vengeance is mine,

2118
04:00:47.115 --> 04:00:48.675
I will repay, says the Lord.

2119
04:00:49.885 --> 04:00:52.705
To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.

2120
04:00:53.735 --> 04:00:57.275
If he's thirsty, giving something to drink for, by so doing,

2121
04:00:57.275 --> 04:01:00.075
you will heap burning coals on his head.

2122
04:01:02.025 --> 04:01:04.245
It doesn't say if he's hungry, laugh at him.

2123
04:01:04.425 --> 04:01:07.165
If he's thirsty, keep pushing him further away.

2124
04:01:07.305 --> 04:01:09.485
No, it says you provide,

2125
04:01:10.625 --> 04:01:14.305
you love them again.

2126
04:01:14.545 --> 04:01:16.145
Remember, David had multiple opportunities

2127
04:01:16.205 --> 04:01:19.305
to take out his enemy to kill Saul, but he didn't do it

2128
04:01:22.155 --> 04:01:25.275
'cause he trusted that God's justice is perfect.

2129
04:01:26.615 --> 04:01:29.075
Our revenge is never perfect.

2130
04:01:30.835 --> 04:01:32.255
We don't know the situation fully.

2131
04:01:32.795 --> 04:01:34.375
We will not do it rightly,

2132
04:01:35.275 --> 04:01:36.935
and we'll be guilty on the other side of it.

2133
04:01:36.955 --> 04:01:41.175
So David trusted God to deal with the situation.

2134
04:01:41.835 --> 04:01:44.255
And you know what? It ended up actually way better

2135
04:01:44.635 --> 04:01:46.535
for David than if he had taken Saul out

2136
04:01:46.535 --> 04:01:47.815
some other way, some other time.

2137
04:01:48.035 --> 04:01:49.255
It ended up better for David

2138
04:01:49.775 --> 04:01:51.855
'cause no one could accuse David of anything.

2139
04:01:51.875 --> 04:01:54.615
At this point. He's in a

2140
04:01:54.615 --> 04:01:55.695
whole different part of the country.

2141
04:01:55.915 --> 04:01:57.775
He had no knowledge of it even happening.

2142
04:01:58.115 --> 04:02:01.215
And now David is the king.

2143
04:02:03.075 --> 04:02:05.415
His hands were clean. Why?

2144
04:02:05.415 --> 04:02:08.015
Because of Romans 12, that mentality.

2145
04:02:08.195 --> 04:02:10.655
He said, I'm gonna overcome evil with good.

2146
04:02:11.905 --> 04:02:13.485
I'm not gonna, like Martin Luther King Jr.

2147
04:02:13.485 --> 04:02:14.645
Said, I'm not gonna overcome evil

2148
04:02:14.645 --> 04:02:16.085
with evil 'cause that just multiplies evil.

2149
04:02:17.105 --> 04:02:18.895
I'm gonna overcome evil with good.

2150
04:02:22.225 --> 04:02:25.135
And we see the result. And

2151
04:02:25.135 --> 04:02:26.415
so let's just play this out for us.

2152
04:02:28.575 --> 04:02:32.315
If that attitude is true of us, if that's commanded of us,

2153
04:02:37.445 --> 04:02:39.475
don't you think that should mean our lives look pretty

2154
04:02:39.475 --> 04:02:42.175
different than the way of the world,

2155
04:02:42.245 --> 04:02:43.695
even than what they commonly do.

2156
04:02:44.925 --> 04:02:46.785
It means things should be very different in

2157
04:02:46.905 --> 04:02:49.865
how we speak about those who oppose us, those

2158
04:02:49.865 --> 04:02:52.825
who are considered enemies, those who are antagonizing us.

2159
04:02:53.005 --> 04:02:54.385
We should speak differently about them.

2160
04:02:54.565 --> 04:02:57.745
Our social media usage should be very different in the way

2161
04:02:57.745 --> 04:02:58.745
we speak about people.

2162
04:02:59.055 --> 04:03:01.985
That way our bumper stickers on our car should not be just

2163
04:03:01.985 --> 04:03:03.105
like everybody else's in the world.

2164
04:03:05.525 --> 04:03:09.145
If this is the mentality, if Jesus said to love your enemies

2165
04:03:09.365 --> 04:03:13.145
and to pray for those who persecute you, we should refuse

2166
04:03:13.565 --> 04:03:15.785
to rejoice when someone on the other side

2167
04:03:15.785 --> 04:03:17.645
of the aisle suffers.

2168
04:03:19.875 --> 04:03:22.095
We should be radically different in the way we treat

2169
04:03:22.095 --> 04:03:23.375
those who oppose us.

2170
04:03:27.675 --> 04:03:29.375
Now, I'm not saying we trust those people,

2171
04:03:31.685 --> 04:03:35.105
but I am saying we ought to speak as well as we can of them.

2172
04:03:36.015 --> 04:03:39.465
Even if they've heard us, we should try to honor

2173
04:03:39.535 --> 04:03:42.585
what we can in that image bearer of God like we are.

2174
04:03:42.845 --> 04:03:46.185
And yes, we don't give everything away to them,

2175
04:03:46.285 --> 04:03:48.185
but despite their failures toward us,

2176
04:03:48.325 --> 04:03:50.065
if Jesus looked at his enemies

2177
04:03:50.065 --> 04:03:52.705
and said, father, forgive them, we can do the same.

2178
04:03:56.365 --> 04:03:57.735
It's what David models so well.

2179
04:03:58.275 --> 04:04:00.135
His heart was so in love with God

2180
04:04:00.135 --> 04:04:02.975
that he could love his enemy, by grieving his enemy's death,

2181
04:04:06.325 --> 04:04:09.145
by honoring him through a song.

2182
04:04:09.815 --> 04:04:11.265
This man who persecuted him.

2183
04:04:14.415 --> 04:04:17.335
I mean, that's the kind of king that God wanted, right?

2184
04:04:19.245 --> 04:04:23.815
It's a good king. So that's one aspect

2185
04:04:23.815 --> 04:04:24.855
of his qualifications.

2186
04:04:24.855 --> 04:04:27.975
Here's another. In the chapters two

2187
04:04:27.975 --> 04:04:29.335
and three, we start to see

2188
04:04:30.045 --> 04:04:32.735
some things show up in David again that adds

2189
04:04:32.735 --> 04:04:33.935
to the qualifications again.

2190
04:04:34.045 --> 04:04:37.455
When Saul died, it seemed like now there's a clear path

2191
04:04:37.455 --> 04:04:41.255
to the throne like David, man, it's yours now.

2192
04:04:41.255 --> 04:04:45.495
Everything is good except for like the, uh,

2193
04:04:45.495 --> 04:04:47.735
legend once said, not so fast my friend.

2194
04:04:51.175 --> 04:04:52.605
We're gonna throw the chart back up there

2195
04:04:52.745 --> 04:04:54.205
and you'll see it on the left.

2196
04:04:54.215 --> 04:04:58.405
David was immediately anointed king of Judah,

2197
04:04:59.715 --> 04:05:03.145
which was only one of the 12 tribes of Israel.

2198
04:05:04.365 --> 04:05:06.905
And then you see that he moved to Hebron,

2199
04:05:07.035 --> 04:05:08.825
which is a small town in the south.

2200
04:05:08.895 --> 04:05:11.865
It's not Jerusalem, which is eventually going to be the,

2201
04:05:11.965 --> 04:05:14.545
the the capital that we will find out, of course.

2202
04:05:14.605 --> 04:05:16.825
But he's in Hebron. He's down in the middle of nowhere.

2203
04:05:17.175 --> 04:05:18.985
King of just one of the 12 tribes.

2204
04:05:20.195 --> 04:05:21.565
Because here's what happened.

2205
04:05:22.895 --> 04:05:26.405
Abner, who was the commander of Saul's army,

2206
04:05:28.355 --> 04:05:30.545
Abner, took one of Saul's other sons

2207
04:05:30.545 --> 04:05:31.545
who didn't die in the battle.

2208
04:05:31.885 --> 04:05:33.585
His name was ish Boche,

2209
04:05:33.995 --> 04:05:35.665
which is not on the top 10 baby names.

2210
04:05:35.705 --> 04:05:37.745
I don't know why, but ish Boche,

2211
04:05:40.745 --> 04:05:43.325
He took that son and said, you're the king.

2212
04:05:43.555 --> 04:05:46.845
Your dad was Saul, you're the king of these tribes.

2213
04:05:47.185 --> 04:05:48.445
All of Israel. 11.

2214
04:05:50.675 --> 04:05:52.965
Well, David's over here, king of one tribe, Judah,

2215
04:05:52.965 --> 04:05:54.085
which is really small too.

2216
04:05:54.105 --> 04:05:55.965
And him and Joe Ab, his military commander,

2217
04:05:55.965 --> 04:05:57.285
they're over here doing this and Israel chef

2218
04:05:57.285 --> 04:05:59.125
and Abner over here doing this.

2219
04:05:59.705 --> 04:06:02.285
It, it starts to smell like civil war, doesn't it?

2220
04:06:03.965 --> 04:06:06.785
And, and things are starting to heat up a little bit here

2221
04:06:07.415 --> 04:06:08.985
that, that Abner didn't like David.

2222
04:06:09.005 --> 04:06:10.865
And so he's like, I'm gonna make Raeth the king

2223
04:06:10.865 --> 04:06:12.225
and this is what's gonna look now.

2224
04:06:14.735 --> 04:06:19.695
Well, it was clearly a case of human, human intuition,

2225
04:06:19.785 --> 04:06:22.855
human wisdom versus divine appointment.

2226
04:06:23.585 --> 04:06:28.535
David, anointed by God as the king Abner says,

2227
04:06:28.535 --> 04:06:30.215
no, no, no ish, which that's gonna be the king.

2228
04:06:32.885 --> 04:06:35.735
Well watch what happens. Look at chapter three.

2229
04:06:36.085 --> 04:06:40.775
Skip ahead a little bit to chapter three verse one.

2230
04:06:43.715 --> 04:06:47.225
We're gonna see the results of that as we go skipping a lot

2231
04:06:47.225 --> 04:06:48.385
of the battles that happened.

2232
04:06:48.385 --> 04:06:50.145
But watch this verse one of chapter three.

2233
04:06:51.035 --> 04:06:52.905
There was a long war between the house

2234
04:06:52.905 --> 04:06:54.065
of Saul and the house of David.

2235
04:06:54.445 --> 04:06:56.065
And David grew stronger

2236
04:06:56.285 --> 04:07:00.145
and stronger while the house of Saul became weaker

2237
04:07:00.525 --> 04:07:04.585
and weaker Even

2238
04:07:04.585 --> 04:07:09.475
through a battle, God was fulfilling his promise to David

2239
04:07:10.135 --> 04:07:12.595
to shift the kingdom to David.

2240
04:07:13.995 --> 04:07:17.975
It was happening. God was bringing about the fulfillment

2241
04:07:17.995 --> 04:07:19.055
of his promise.

2242
04:07:19.155 --> 04:07:21.135
But here's what's interesting about how this played out.

2243
04:07:22.845 --> 04:07:26.695
What happened next is that Abner who was with the 11 tribes

2244
04:07:26.695 --> 04:07:31.015
and with the king, he anointed, he actually defects

2245
04:07:31.075 --> 04:07:32.335
and changes his mind

2246
04:07:32.335 --> 04:07:34.175
because of something the Israel did to him.

2247
04:07:34.395 --> 04:07:36.415
He changed his mind and said, no, I'm following David now.

2248
04:07:36.555 --> 04:07:39.055
He defects and comes over to follow David

2249
04:07:39.195 --> 04:07:43.495
and all the 11 tribes begin to trickle alongside with him.

2250
04:07:43.545 --> 04:07:45.175
We'll see that over the next couple chapters.

2251
04:07:46.275 --> 04:07:49.335
But there was a problem. Abner was the enemy.

2252
04:07:49.935 --> 04:07:53.695
Military commander, David's commander Joe Joab was not

2253
04:07:53.935 --> 04:07:55.015
involved in those conversations.

2254
04:07:56.605 --> 04:07:58.095
Joab has no idea this is happening.

2255
04:07:58.685 --> 04:07:59.775
He's out doing the work

2256
04:08:01.385 --> 04:08:04.925
and he comes home, watch what he thought was happening.

2257
04:08:05.315 --> 04:08:07.925
This is verses 22 through 25

2258
04:08:09.425 --> 04:08:13.275
of chapter three, Starting verse 22.

2259
04:08:13.385 --> 04:08:15.475
Just then the service of David arrived

2260
04:08:15.475 --> 04:08:18.355
with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them.

2261
04:08:18.375 --> 04:08:20.115
But Abner was not with David at Hebrew.

2262
04:08:20.115 --> 04:08:23.315
And he'd sent him away. He'd gone in peace when Joab

2263
04:08:23.315 --> 04:08:26.635
and all the army with him came, it was told Joab, Abner,

2264
04:08:26.895 --> 04:08:28.275
the son of Ner came to the king.

2265
04:08:28.745 --> 04:08:30.435
He's let him go. He's gone in peace.

2266
04:08:31.345 --> 04:08:33.525
And then Joab went to the king and said, what have you done?

2267
04:08:34.855 --> 04:08:36.115
The old Abner came to you.

2268
04:08:36.175 --> 04:08:38.155
Why is it that you sent him away so that he's gone?

2269
04:08:38.175 --> 04:08:40.675
You know, Abner, the son of Ner came to deceive you

2270
04:08:41.615 --> 04:08:42.715
and to know you're going out.

2271
04:08:42.715 --> 04:08:45.275
You're coming in and to know all that you are doing.

2272
04:08:45.735 --> 04:08:48.235
Now here's a little side note, why would Abner not?

2273
04:08:48.785 --> 04:08:50.675
Well Joe Ab not trust Abner, partly

2274
04:08:50.795 --> 04:08:52.475
'cause he was on the other side, but also

2275
04:08:53.445 --> 04:08:56.515
Abner had killed Joe Abs brother in a battle earlier.

2276
04:08:57.815 --> 04:09:00.275
So there was already personal

2277
04:09:00.595 --> 04:09:01.995
animosity between the two of them.

2278
04:09:03.215 --> 04:09:06.035
And Joe was like, dude, listen, he, David, he's coming

2279
04:09:06.055 --> 04:09:07.635
to try to figure out our plans.

2280
04:09:08.065 --> 04:09:10.075
He's deceiving. You don't trust him.

2281
04:09:13.165 --> 04:09:16.735
Well watch how Joab handled this situation.

2282
04:09:16.795 --> 04:09:17.815
Verses 26

2283
04:09:17.835 --> 04:09:22.245
and 27, When Joab came out from God's,

2284
04:09:22.245 --> 04:09:23.245
from David's presence.

2285
04:09:23.245 --> 04:09:25.045
He sent messengers after Abner

2286
04:09:25.045 --> 04:09:26.885
and they brought him back from the cistern of Sarah.

2287
04:09:27.545 --> 04:09:29.685
But David did not know about this.

2288
04:09:30.585 --> 04:09:32.635
And When Abner returned to Hebrew

2289
04:09:32.655 --> 04:09:35.275
and Joab took him aside in the midst of the gate to speak

2290
04:09:35.275 --> 04:09:38.075
with him privately, and there he struck him in the stomach

2291
04:09:38.455 --> 04:09:42.235
so that he died for the blood of Asel, his brother.

2292
04:09:46.845 --> 04:09:49.975
This is a test for David, isn't it?

2293
04:09:52.505 --> 04:09:56.675
You've got division among the people, you've got

2294
04:09:57.475 --> 04:09:58.795
conflict among his leaders.

2295
04:10:00.735 --> 04:10:04.705
It's a test of David as the new king.

2296
04:10:06.695 --> 04:10:09.945
Plus you have not only the divisions, you have this murder.

2297
04:10:10.085 --> 04:10:12.265
Now that it could have come back on David,

2298
04:10:12.455 --> 04:10:14.785
that he manipulated the enemy's death.

2299
04:10:14.925 --> 04:10:17.625
He brought Abner in here, he deceived him

2300
04:10:17.625 --> 04:10:19.345
and then sent Joe AB to go finish the job.

2301
04:10:19.415 --> 04:10:21.785
Like, no, he, he could have been read that way.

2302
04:10:24.035 --> 04:10:25.095
If it's not that at,

2303
04:10:25.275 --> 04:10:27.855
at the very least it's you got a general murdering another

2304
04:10:27.855 --> 04:10:31.015
general, like that's not so it's a problem.

2305
04:10:31.085 --> 04:10:35.095
It's a test. How was David gonna lead through the crisis?

2306
04:10:37.685 --> 04:10:38.995
Watch verse 28.

2307
04:10:41.155 --> 04:10:43.845
Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, I

2308
04:10:43.845 --> 04:10:46.165
and my kingdom are forever guiltless

2309
04:10:46.225 --> 04:10:49.085
before the Lord for the blood of Abner, the son of Ner.

2310
04:10:49.555 --> 04:10:54.445
Like he publicly disavowed anything, any involvement.

2311
04:10:54.465 --> 04:10:56.845
He didn't have anything to do with this.

2312
04:10:57.155 --> 04:11:00.285
Even the next verse, he calls down a curse on Joab

2313
04:11:00.285 --> 04:11:02.565
because Joab took vengeance he shouldn't have.

2314
04:11:03.965 --> 04:11:06.955
David says, I didn't do it. Joab did it and he was wrong.

2315
04:11:10.335 --> 04:11:12.555
Now verses 31 and 32, watch.

2316
04:11:13.495 --> 04:11:15.635
And then David said to Joab

2317
04:11:15.635 --> 04:11:18.275
and to all the people who were with him, tear your clothes

2318
04:11:18.375 --> 04:11:21.355
and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner

2319
04:11:21.375 --> 04:11:23.275
and King David followed the beer.

2320
04:11:23.275 --> 04:11:24.795
That's the the coffin.

2321
04:11:25.145 --> 04:11:28.195
They buried Abner at Hebron and the king lifted up his voice

2322
04:11:28.255 --> 04:11:32.275
and wept at the grave of Abner and all the people wept.

2323
04:11:33.345 --> 04:11:35.035
This sounds familiar, doesn't it?

2324
04:11:37.105 --> 04:11:41.415
It's what he did with Saul enemy number one. Saul.

2325
04:11:41.865 --> 04:11:43.175
David grieved him.

2326
04:11:43.665 --> 04:11:45.695
Abner was on the other side with Saul

2327
04:11:45.915 --> 04:11:50.315
and he grieved abner's loss publicly.

2328
04:11:52.655 --> 04:11:54.775
And Now verse 35.

2329
04:11:57.565 --> 04:11:59.425
And then all the people came to persuade David

2330
04:11:59.445 --> 04:12:00.945
to eat bread while it was yet day.

2331
04:12:00.945 --> 04:12:03.145
But David swore saying, God do so to me

2332
04:12:03.145 --> 04:12:04.825
and more also if I taste bread

2333
04:12:05.125 --> 04:12:07.345
or anything else, till the sun goes down.

2334
04:12:07.845 --> 04:12:09.305
That's just signs of grief.

2335
04:12:09.975 --> 04:12:12.605
He's lamenting fasting publicly saying,

2336
04:12:13.145 --> 04:12:15.685
you should be grieving the loss of Abner two.

2337
04:12:19.505 --> 04:12:21.005
So he's again, showing his heart.

2338
04:12:21.225 --> 04:12:22.365
But watch what all that did.

2339
04:12:22.365 --> 04:12:24.085
Here's why I went through this watch

2340
04:12:24.115 --> 04:12:26.485
what happens next verses 36 and 37,

2341
04:12:29.065 --> 04:12:31.845
and all the people took notice of it

2342
04:12:32.705 --> 04:12:35.855
and it pleased them as everything

2343
04:12:35.855 --> 04:12:37.335
that the king did, pleased all the people.

2344
04:12:37.635 --> 04:12:40.295
So all the people of and all Israel understood that day.

2345
04:12:40.515 --> 04:12:43.175
It had not been the king's will to put to death.

2346
04:12:43.625 --> 04:12:45.495
Abner, the son of Ner.

2347
04:12:47.555 --> 04:12:52.105
Like you see what happened, David, in his transparent

2348
04:12:52.855 --> 04:12:54.865
integrity filled leadership,

2349
04:12:55.445 --> 04:12:57.345
he won the hearts of the people.

2350
04:12:59.115 --> 04:13:01.445
Like, no, no, David didn't do that. That was Joab.

2351
04:13:02.605 --> 04:13:05.825
We love David. We trust David. Watch how he's responded.

2352
04:13:06.695 --> 04:13:08.315
It won the people's hearts.

2353
04:13:08.315 --> 04:13:10.315
You see why God could trust David

2354
04:13:11.265 --> 04:13:12.915
with the kingship of his people.

2355
04:13:14.225 --> 04:13:15.965
His heart was close to God, he was wanting

2356
04:13:15.965 --> 04:13:18.005
to do all the right things in every situation.

2357
04:13:18.295 --> 04:13:22.205
David led through division, he led

2358
04:13:22.205 --> 04:13:24.175
with integrity like that.

2359
04:13:24.175 --> 04:13:28.225
That's the point here. Even through division, the chaos

2360
04:13:29.735 --> 04:13:32.945
murders and, and people divided and,

2361
04:13:32.965 --> 04:13:34.945
and tribes splitting up like all of this.

2362
04:13:34.955 --> 04:13:37.465
David was like, I, I have integrity

2363
04:13:37.725 --> 04:13:40.905
and I'm going to lead with it through all of that.

2364
04:13:45.365 --> 04:13:50.245
Now, what is integrity? Basic answer,

2365
04:13:50.245 --> 04:13:54.205
integrity is when your private life matches

2366
04:13:54.835 --> 04:13:59.335
your public testimony, the way you think and live

2367
04:13:59.335 --> 04:14:01.775
and act inside yourself matches the way

2368
04:14:02.125 --> 04:14:03.775
that you act publicly.

2369
04:14:03.775 --> 04:14:08.735
You're the same in every situation. Is that true of you?

2370
04:14:12.815 --> 04:14:14.555
And and I'm not just saying like when things are really

2371
04:14:14.555 --> 04:14:15.835
good, you know, you can do

2372
04:14:15.835 --> 04:14:17.475
that when things are good in your life,

2373
04:14:17.895 --> 04:14:19.715
of course you can act the same way with everybody.

2374
04:14:19.745 --> 04:14:20.795
It's not, that's not a problem.

2375
04:14:21.015 --> 04:14:25.135
But when things fall apart, crumble, it begins

2376
04:14:25.135 --> 04:14:26.575
to really squeeze out what's

2377
04:14:26.655 --> 04:14:27.735
actually in the sponge of your heart.

2378
04:14:29.965 --> 04:14:34.245
Are you the same in every situation? That's integrity.

2379
04:14:36.455 --> 04:14:39.715
And I man, this, this was hard to, this part was hard

2380
04:14:39.895 --> 04:14:40.995
for me this week to write,

2381
04:14:41.215 --> 04:14:45.315
but let, let's just think about how we as Christians

2382
04:14:46.005 --> 04:14:47.115
don't do this very well.

2383
04:14:50.255 --> 04:14:54.405
Think about how often what we say

2384
04:14:54.945 --> 04:14:56.565
we believe and how we should live

2385
04:14:58.585 --> 04:15:02.075
doesn't in any way match the way we actually live.

2386
04:15:05.065 --> 04:15:07.125
And I don't just say that to, to say, well,

2387
04:15:07.125 --> 04:15:09.685
I think objectively kind of, you know, it's,

2388
04:15:09.755 --> 04:15:10.845
it's a bit of here and there.

2389
04:15:10.925 --> 04:15:12.325
I see it happen from time to time.

2390
04:15:12.505 --> 04:15:17.175
No, statistically this bears out that we

2391
04:15:17.175 --> 04:15:19.495
as Christians say, we believe and do certain things,

2392
04:15:19.595 --> 04:15:20.815
but we actually don't.

2393
04:15:20.815 --> 04:15:21.975
Lemme give you a couple examples.

2394
04:15:24.715 --> 04:15:29.665
We talk about sexual purity a lot, yet pornography

2395
04:15:30.765 --> 04:15:34.145
and just messing around runs rampant,

2396
04:15:35.885 --> 04:15:39.255
not just in younger people, in every generation,

2397
04:15:42.615 --> 04:15:46.195
we declare the, the sacredness that we as Christians,

2398
04:15:46.755 --> 04:15:51.035
marriage is sacred and yet hundreds upon hundreds

2399
04:15:51.035 --> 04:15:55.075
of spouses are abused and mistreated

2400
04:15:55.215 --> 04:15:58.185
and are terrified to go home within churches.

2401
04:16:03.905 --> 04:16:08.085
We, we say we believe in caring for the poor, caring

2402
04:16:08.105 --> 04:16:11.365
for the outcast in providing generously to people in need,

2403
04:16:11.705 --> 04:16:14.925
yet our money and our time flow to the lake house

2404
04:16:15.225 --> 04:16:17.005
or to more toys for ourselves.

2405
04:16:22.185 --> 04:16:25.925
We say we believe, we say we treasure and cherish,

2406
04:16:26.225 --> 04:16:29.525
and yet our lives look so far from it.

2407
04:16:33.215 --> 04:16:35.235
And we could go on and on. There's list after list.

2408
04:16:35.235 --> 04:16:39.155
But listen, when our lives don't come close to matching

2409
04:16:39.155 --> 04:16:43.655
what we say, the world looks at this

2410
04:16:44.115 --> 04:16:46.615
and just sees it as religious performance.

2411
04:16:49.285 --> 04:16:50.495
They don't see true faith.

2412
04:16:52.565 --> 04:16:55.015
What they see is a social club with a little bit

2413
04:16:55.015 --> 04:16:56.655
of morality sprinkled on top of it.

2414
04:17:00.395 --> 04:17:02.895
And so something needs to change in our lives, right?

2415
04:17:04.745 --> 04:17:07.475
Like, is that all this is, is this just a social club

2416
04:17:07.475 --> 04:17:09.275
that we have some Jesus language on top?

2417
04:17:09.455 --> 04:17:13.385
Is that all? Is that all this is something needs

2418
04:17:13.385 --> 04:17:14.585
to change in our lives?

2419
04:17:14.965 --> 04:17:16.585
How do we get to that level of integrity

2420
04:17:16.635 --> 04:17:17.785
where we're the same person?

2421
04:17:18.035 --> 04:17:20.945
Every situation, every situation of life,

2422
04:17:20.995 --> 04:17:23.545
we're gonna look the same externally, internally,

2423
04:17:24.145 --> 04:17:25.465
regardless of how our life's going.

2424
04:17:25.645 --> 04:17:27.985
How can we get there? How did David get there?

2425
04:17:31.155 --> 04:17:33.055
Go back quickly to chapter two verse one.

2426
04:17:38.055 --> 04:17:40.665
Just quickly look at this Chapter two verse one.

2427
04:17:41.775 --> 04:17:43.705
This was right after Saul died,

2428
04:17:44.125 --> 04:17:45.945
the crisis moment of his life.

2429
04:17:46.005 --> 04:17:48.265
He could decide to go whichever way he wanted.

2430
04:17:48.275 --> 04:17:49.385
Watch this verse one

2431
04:17:49.555 --> 04:17:52.505
after this, David inquired of the Lord,

2432
04:17:53.315 --> 04:17:55.345
shall I go up into the any of the cities of Judah?

2433
04:17:55.405 --> 04:17:56.785
The Lord said to him, go up. Okay?

2434
04:17:56.785 --> 04:17:58.185
David said, all right, to which shall I go up?

2435
04:17:58.285 --> 04:18:02.625
And he said to Hebrew, did you see what that phrase was?

2436
04:18:02.915 --> 04:18:05.465
David inquired of the Lord.

2437
04:18:09.015 --> 04:18:12.905
That phrase appears at least six times in first

2438
04:18:12.905 --> 04:18:16.775
and second Samuel I, as he is deciding where

2439
04:18:16.775 --> 04:18:18.215
to go, deciding what to do.

2440
04:18:18.275 --> 04:18:20.615
Should I do this? Should I, how could I talk this way?

2441
04:18:20.615 --> 04:18:21.655
David inquired to the Lord.

2442
04:18:21.705 --> 04:18:22.815
David inquired to the Lord

2443
04:18:22.955 --> 04:18:26.135
that's revealing something about his heart, right?

2444
04:18:28.615 --> 04:18:31.955
It means David's highest priority was knowing God's will

2445
04:18:32.095 --> 04:18:33.315
and obeying God's will.

2446
04:18:33.315 --> 04:18:36.235
David, I God's, God's saying, David is saying,

2447
04:18:36.255 --> 04:18:37.395
God, I want to follow you.

2448
04:18:37.595 --> 04:18:39.915
I want to know your will. I wanna be obedient to you.

2449
04:18:40.255 --> 04:18:41.395
He, he had integrity

2450
04:18:41.735 --> 04:18:44.795
and he was saying, God, I trust your will over my ambition.

2451
04:18:45.035 --> 04:18:48.155
I want nothing else but your will.

2452
04:18:49.695 --> 04:18:51.795
Any authority he received came from his

2453
04:18:51.795 --> 04:18:53.075
submission to the ultimate authority.

2454
04:18:53.295 --> 04:18:56.235
It wasn't him claiming it, it was him receiving it

2455
04:18:56.335 --> 04:18:57.755
and he lived it out with integrity.

2456
04:18:58.935 --> 04:19:00.115
Is that how you live your life?

2457
04:19:03.155 --> 04:19:05.335
Is that how you live your life?

2458
04:19:07.065 --> 04:19:10.675
Have you said to your heavenly Father, not my will,

2459
04:19:10.935 --> 04:19:15.175
but your will be done in every

2460
04:19:15.775 --> 04:19:17.535
situation, every moment.

2461
04:19:18.045 --> 04:19:21.295
Your highest priority is God, I wanna obey you.

2462
04:19:21.565 --> 04:19:23.375
Your commands, your leadership,

2463
04:19:23.375 --> 04:19:25.535
everything in my life is all yours.

2464
04:19:25.675 --> 04:19:28.615
Or are you more focused on your personal ambition,

2465
04:19:28.845 --> 04:19:31.855
your personal preferences, your way of doing things?

2466
04:19:32.075 --> 04:19:35.695
Are you trying to force through your plan instead of waiting

2467
04:19:35.755 --> 04:19:36.855
for God's timing?

2468
04:19:38.945 --> 04:19:40.365
Are you going about your life?

2469
04:19:40.465 --> 04:19:42.045
And man, this is really easy for me to do.

2470
04:19:42.225 --> 04:19:44.205
Are you going through your life saying, okay,

2471
04:19:44.515 --> 04:19:46.965
I've got all this intuition, I've got all this knowledge,

2472
04:19:47.075 --> 04:19:48.405
I've got all this history.

2473
04:19:48.805 --> 04:19:51.125
I know how to live my life. I know where I'm going.

2474
04:19:51.525 --> 04:19:55.575
I don't need you. God, none of us would ever say

2475
04:19:55.575 --> 04:19:56.935
that, but we live it.

2476
04:20:02.945 --> 04:20:07.475
Instead of humbly coming to prayerfully, coming

2477
04:20:07.495 --> 04:20:11.115
to God's Word and saying, God, what do you want?

2478
04:20:12.635 --> 04:20:13.845
Like God, what's your will?

2479
04:20:16.115 --> 04:20:18.165
Clearly commands are his will.

2480
04:20:18.345 --> 04:20:19.485
But then he's like, he,

2481
04:20:19.485 --> 04:20:21.805
he's not maybe gonna write it on the sky where you should go

2482
04:20:21.805 --> 04:20:23.485
to college or where you should do this

2483
04:20:23.505 --> 04:20:24.525
or that, or who are you gonna marry?

2484
04:20:24.965 --> 04:20:27.525
Whatever it is like He, but, but you should filter

2485
04:20:27.585 --> 04:20:28.645
it through the lens.

2486
04:20:28.945 --> 04:20:31.805
God, show me God, tell me whichever way

2487
04:20:31.825 --> 04:20:34.325
and trust he's gonna lead your pathway as you go.

2488
04:20:34.465 --> 04:20:35.645
Is that the way you live your life?

2489
04:20:35.655 --> 04:20:38.605
Every moment you wake up of the day and,

2490
04:20:38.605 --> 04:20:41.165
and every moment of the day you say, God, not my will,

2491
04:20:41.165 --> 04:20:43.405
but your will be done on Friday night.

2492
04:20:43.405 --> 04:20:45.045
When that temptation comes, God,

2493
04:20:45.105 --> 04:20:46.565
not my will, your will be done.

2494
04:20:46.755 --> 04:20:50.125
When you face that crisis moment in your family, God,

2495
04:20:50.225 --> 04:20:52.565
not my will, your will be done at work

2496
04:20:52.625 --> 04:20:55.125
and you're tempted to do a little bit of cutting corners,

2497
04:20:55.225 --> 04:20:56.805
God, not my will, but your will be done.

2498
04:20:58.355 --> 04:20:59.575
Is that how you live your life?

2499
04:21:04.185 --> 04:21:06.245
That's the environment integrity grows in.

2500
04:21:07.345 --> 04:21:10.565
That's when you submit to the, the will of the Father

2501
04:21:11.385 --> 04:21:13.485
and you say, God, I'm getting out of the way.

2502
04:21:13.795 --> 04:21:16.005
It's yours. I'm following you.

2503
04:21:16.985 --> 04:21:18.285
He makes you more Christ-like

2504
04:21:18.525 --> 04:21:20.685
'cause you obey him, you follow him.

2505
04:21:23.545 --> 04:21:26.125
And that's how he grows the character in you

2506
04:21:26.125 --> 04:21:28.405
that looks more like Jesus in the small things

2507
04:21:29.225 --> 04:21:31.725
as he prepares you for something that may be bigger later

2508
04:21:37.425 --> 04:21:39.285
and so far in first and second Samuel.

2509
04:21:39.285 --> 04:21:40.765
But we've seen David do that pretty well.

2510
04:21:45.025 --> 04:21:46.485
But sadly that won't last very long.

2511
04:21:49.135 --> 04:21:53.275
You may remember the story in Genesis of the Garden of Eden

2512
04:21:53.275 --> 04:21:57.235
and Adam and Eve, like it was really good for two chapters.

2513
04:22:00.125 --> 04:22:01.985
And then chapter three, it all tanks

2514
04:22:01.985 --> 04:22:03.065
and everything goes south.

2515
04:22:03.205 --> 04:22:05.995
And, and we'll see David

2516
04:22:07.885 --> 04:22:10.575
fall into some of the same traps that Saul

2517
04:22:10.635 --> 04:22:12.895
and others did as the king,

2518
04:22:16.405 --> 04:22:19.635
which again leads us to the overall point of these books.

2519
04:22:21.665 --> 04:22:22.805
Yes, David's a great example.

2520
04:22:22.875 --> 04:22:24.165
He's a man after God's own heart.

2521
04:22:24.165 --> 04:22:25.365
He's Israel's greatest king.

2522
04:22:25.365 --> 04:22:28.805
But hear me, David is not the hero of this story.

2523
04:22:33.625 --> 04:22:38.155
He's merely a pointer to the true hero.

2524
04:22:38.535 --> 04:22:42.075
The one who fulfilled all that David could merely

2525
04:22:42.715 --> 04:22:44.315
resemble Jesus Christ.

2526
04:22:45.805 --> 04:22:47.195
Jesus fulfilled

2527
04:22:48.305 --> 04:22:51.875
what David could only bear some resemblance to

2528
04:22:53.655 --> 04:22:54.675
now we're gonna see David.

2529
04:22:55.215 --> 04:22:57.475
Yes, he appeared to be a savior in many ways.

2530
04:22:57.575 --> 04:22:59.635
He re he brought the nation together.

2531
04:22:59.895 --> 04:23:01.195
He was a savior of his people.

2532
04:23:01.255 --> 04:23:04.675
He was kind of messiah like kind of Christ-like in a way.

2533
04:23:04.895 --> 04:23:08.195
He was a type. He taught us a lot about the Messiah to come.

2534
04:23:08.455 --> 04:23:10.075
But he is not the savior.

2535
04:23:10.075 --> 04:23:13.995
There's a true greater king to come after David.

2536
04:23:15.265 --> 04:23:17.645
And he's the one that we stand today

2537
04:23:17.905 --> 04:23:21.925
and we worship the perfect king who did everything in full

2538
04:23:22.075 --> 04:23:24.805
that David could only do in part who fulfilled it all.

2539
04:23:24.805 --> 04:23:26.485
Everything David did imperfectly.

2540
04:23:26.695 --> 04:23:29.765
Jesus did perfectly just listen to how he did this,

2541
04:23:29.905 --> 04:23:31.325
how Jesus is the greater David.

2542
04:23:31.745 --> 04:23:35.485
He loved his enemies, not just by grieving for them,

2543
04:23:35.945 --> 04:23:37.485
but by dying for them.

2544
04:23:40.085 --> 04:23:42.955
Jesus sought the father's will perfectly, even in the garden

2545
04:23:42.955 --> 04:23:46.115
of Gethsemane when he's facing the, the horror of the cross,

2546
04:23:46.295 --> 04:23:48.115
the very next day he said,

2547
04:23:48.375 --> 04:23:49.835
not my will, but your will be done.

2548
04:23:52.345 --> 04:23:55.085
He always led with complete transparency and integrity.

2549
04:23:55.115 --> 04:23:58.165
Hebrews four 15, we do not have a high priest who's unable

2550
04:23:58.165 --> 04:23:59.485
to sympathize with our weaknesses,

2551
04:23:59.785 --> 04:24:02.845
but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are

2552
04:24:03.345 --> 04:24:04.605
yet without sin.

2553
04:24:06.745 --> 04:24:08.525
That's our king. Perfect.

2554
04:24:10.795 --> 04:24:12.215
And because of that perfection,

2555
04:24:12.215 --> 04:24:15.175
because of that obedience through his death

2556
04:24:15.175 --> 04:24:19.375
and resurrection, he has ended the ultimate division

2557
04:24:19.645 --> 04:24:20.695
between God

2558
04:24:20.795 --> 04:24:24.575
and humanity, by bringing sinners back home

2559
04:24:24.795 --> 04:24:26.855
to God the Father, the civil war

2560
04:24:26.855 --> 04:24:29.295
that David faced has no candle to hold

2561
04:24:29.475 --> 04:24:32.295
to the desperate dependence we have on God

2562
04:24:32.315 --> 04:24:35.695
to take sinners home with him only through his work.

2563
04:24:38.125 --> 04:24:41.375
That is our king. That's who this is pointing us to.

2564
04:24:43.805 --> 04:24:47.185
And all praise should go to that true king Jesus Christ.

2565
04:24:47.235 --> 04:24:50.545
Let's pray. God, thank you so much for your grace

2566
04:24:50.805 --> 04:24:55.305
and mercy, your word pointing us to those truths.

2567
04:24:55.325 --> 04:24:59.025
And I pray, God, that, that we would recognize

2568
04:24:59.045 --> 04:25:02.225
and see you as the true king.

2569
04:25:02.275 --> 04:25:03.785
Learn from what we can with David,

2570
04:25:04.365 --> 04:25:07.265
but point to you, look to you, worship you.

2571
04:25:11.045 --> 04:25:13.985
But I know there's some of us walked in this room today,

2572
04:25:15.245 --> 04:25:18.625
and we've spent most of our lives looking for a king

2573
04:25:21.245 --> 04:25:24.665
In this world, somebody to satisfy, somebody

2574
04:25:24.665 --> 04:25:26.185
to fulfill somebody, to protect

2575
04:25:26.655 --> 04:25:28.585
something, to do all of that.

2576
04:25:29.005 --> 04:25:33.265
And they are disappointed and exhausted in that search.

2577
04:25:36.855 --> 04:25:40.105
Some have walked in here looking for themself

2578
04:25:40.725 --> 04:25:43.225
to be the king, to be able to live it out perfectly,

2579
04:25:43.245 --> 04:25:45.785
to be this one that, that I just described.

2580
04:25:47.685 --> 04:25:49.825
And they're recognizing that they can't do that.

2581
04:25:51.535 --> 04:25:53.265
They never could. And so God,

2582
04:25:53.265 --> 04:25:55.225
what you're just showing us always is that we need

2583
04:25:55.225 --> 04:25:56.225
to save your king

2584
04:25:59.045 --> 04:26:01.865
and praise the Father that you provided.

2585
04:26:04.205 --> 04:26:06.905
God the Son, took on flesh to do all of this

2586
04:26:09.205 --> 04:26:13.585
so that we could be saved, which means you're worthy.

2587
04:26:15.045 --> 04:26:18.385
So God, draw us to yourself in that, help us see you rightly

2588
04:26:18.885 --> 04:26:21.905
and respond to you rightly in Jesus' name.

2589
04:26:22.495 --> 04:26:25.025
Amen. Part of

2590
04:26:25.025 --> 04:26:28.145
that response today involves the Lord's supper as a reminder

2591
04:26:28.145 --> 04:26:29.745
of what that savior king has done for us.

2592
04:26:29.765 --> 04:26:31.985
So invite El uh, one of our elders, Chris,

2593
04:26:32.055 --> 04:26:33.105
come lead us through that.

2594
04:26:36.675 --> 04:26:41.065
Thank you John, for that message of, um,

2595
04:26:41.585 --> 04:26:44.505
a reminder of our call to integrity,

2596
04:26:44.645 --> 04:26:46.705
but also the reminder that Jesus is the one

2597
04:26:46.705 --> 04:26:49.705
that's the perfect example of all of thats the reason

2598
04:26:49.705 --> 04:26:51.825
that we are here today.

2599
04:26:51.965 --> 04:26:55.545
We have this fellowship together as disciples,

2600
04:26:55.605 --> 04:27:00.025
as his believers, as his followers, And

2601
04:27:00.025 --> 04:27:02.085
that's why we serve the Lord's Supper.

2602
04:27:02.105 --> 04:27:05.645
So if you are, um, if you're helping to serve the, the,

2603
04:27:05.665 --> 04:27:07.325
the elements this morning, will you go ahead

2604
04:27:07.325 --> 04:27:09.605
and make your way and begin in passing out those trays?

2605
04:27:11.045 --> 04:27:13.605
I do wanna remind us though that this is something

2606
04:27:13.605 --> 04:27:17.645
that we do as, as, uh, god's, as Jesus's disciples,

2607
04:27:17.665 --> 04:27:18.685
as unified body.

2608
04:27:19.105 --> 04:27:20.845
And so there are a couple of instances

2609
04:27:20.845 --> 04:27:23.205
where we shouldn't take this, um,

2610
04:27:23.475 --> 04:27:25.005
this supper, this meal together.

2611
04:27:25.985 --> 04:27:29.605
And if you are not a disciple of Jesus yet, our hope is

2612
04:27:29.605 --> 04:27:31.405
that you are and you become part of this body.

2613
04:27:31.825 --> 04:27:33.405
Um, but we would ask you to go ahead

2614
04:27:33.405 --> 04:27:36.165
and just pass those trays on, um, as this is something

2615
04:27:36.165 --> 04:27:39.325
that Jesus has commanded for his church to do.

2616
04:27:41.025 --> 04:27:43.685
And if you have any unrepentant sin

2617
04:27:43.985 --> 04:27:47.605
or grievances, especially within the body that are, um,

2618
04:27:48.105 --> 04:27:51.285
not dealt with, I would also encourage you to pass that on.

2619
04:27:51.345 --> 04:27:54.365
And, and until we've, uh, restored unity

2620
04:27:54.425 --> 04:27:55.845
and harmony within the body,

2621
04:27:56.105 --> 04:27:58.765
and we take this meal together rightly, uh,

2622
04:27:59.185 --> 04:28:02.165
to honor the unity that Jesus has created in the body,

2623
04:28:04.185 --> 04:28:06.885
and as we take this meal together, we're reminded

2624
04:28:06.885 --> 04:28:09.245
of why Jesus commands us to do this.

2625
04:28:09.245 --> 04:28:12.405
And it's, it's such a good thing that Jesus does command us

2626
04:28:12.405 --> 04:28:13.485
to take this meal together

2627
04:28:13.915 --> 04:28:16.045
because it's a reminder of several things.

2628
04:28:16.225 --> 04:28:20.685
One, it's a reminder how Jesus has created a people

2629
04:28:22.035 --> 04:28:26.845
He's brought out like as in an exodus, a people for himself.

2630
04:28:27.265 --> 04:28:29.325
And the way he did is by dying on a cross,

2631
04:28:30.245 --> 04:28:33.205
shedding his own blood, breaking his own body so

2632
04:28:33.205 --> 04:28:34.565
that we can be redeemed.

2633
04:28:35.545 --> 04:28:36.925
And so it's a reminder of that.

2634
04:28:37.915 --> 04:28:40.565
It's also a reminder of the unity he's created in the body

2635
04:28:40.565 --> 04:28:41.605
that we share together.

2636
04:28:41.825 --> 04:28:43.125
But it's also a reminder of

2637
04:28:43.125 --> 04:28:46.525
how Jesus is victorious reigning on the throne right now.

2638
04:28:48.705 --> 04:28:51.725
So what I'm going to do is, uh,

2639
04:28:52.785 --> 04:28:55.125
I'm gonna encourage us to look a few different directions,

2640
04:28:55.315 --> 04:28:57.805
look in the past or look inwardly first

2641
04:28:58.305 --> 04:28:59.765
to see if this is something we should

2642
04:28:59.765 --> 04:29:01.245
be participating in this morning.

2643
04:29:01.995 --> 04:29:04.605
Look to the past. Remember what Jesus has done for us

2644
04:29:04.745 --> 04:29:05.885
to create this church.

2645
04:29:07.475 --> 04:29:10.525
Look upward to recognize Jesus on the throne

2646
04:29:11.285 --> 04:29:12.525
reigning even today.

2647
04:29:13.385 --> 04:29:17.325
And then look forward to see what he has promised to redeem

2648
04:29:17.895 --> 04:29:20.885
fully people for himself and make all things new.

2649
04:29:21.305 --> 04:29:22.965
And that's what we celebrate this morning.

2650
04:29:23.945 --> 04:29:25.925
So as you receive the elements,

2651
04:29:25.965 --> 04:29:29.125
there'll be two cups stacked on top of each other,

2652
04:29:29.505 --> 04:29:31.005
the bread and, and the drink.

2653
04:29:33.225 --> 04:29:35.245
I'm gonna, I'm gonna read through these instructions

2654
04:29:35.245 --> 04:29:38.125
that Paul gives us for taking of this supper.

2655
04:29:39.705 --> 04:29:43.285
He says in one Corinthians 11, Paul says,

2656
04:29:43.285 --> 04:29:47.325
for I received from the Lord, what I also deliver to you

2657
04:29:48.795 --> 04:29:51.605
that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was

2658
04:29:51.605 --> 04:29:52.965
betrayed, he took bread.

2659
04:29:53.745 --> 04:29:56.205
And when he had given thanks, he broke it

2660
04:29:56.345 --> 04:29:59.525
and said, this is my body, which is for you.

2661
04:30:00.625 --> 04:30:03.005
Do this in remembrance of me.

2662
04:30:03.025 --> 04:30:05.405
So let's do that as we remember Jesus this morning.

2663
04:30:13.785 --> 04:30:18.045
And it says in the same way also, he took the cup

2664
04:30:18.495 --> 04:30:21.445
after supper saying, this cup

2665
04:30:22.425 --> 04:30:25.405
is the new covenant in my blood.

2666
04:30:26.585 --> 04:30:30.685
Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.

2667
04:30:30.745 --> 04:30:32.125
So let's drink the cup together.

2668
04:30:36.145 --> 04:30:38.685
And then the way he he finishes the says is he says,

2669
04:30:38.705 --> 04:30:41.565
for us often as you eat this bread

2670
04:30:41.585 --> 04:30:44.925
and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's

2671
04:30:44.925 --> 04:30:46.325
death until he comes.

2672
04:30:46.745 --> 04:30:48.845
And so church, that's what we've just done today

2673
04:30:49.705 --> 04:30:52.685
by taking these simple elements, this cracker

2674
04:30:52.785 --> 04:30:56.685
and this juice we've proclaimed

2675
04:30:57.265 --> 04:31:00.725
in a way we can't even fathom Jesus's death

2676
04:31:01.305 --> 04:31:02.725
and what that has accomplished.

2677
04:31:02.745 --> 04:31:04.005
And we look around this room

2678
04:31:04.625 --> 04:31:08.365
and recognize all of this belongs to Jesus, all of us.

2679
04:31:10.155 --> 04:31:12.805
It's for him and for his glory.

2680
04:31:12.905 --> 04:31:14.285
And then we look to the future

2681
04:31:14.345 --> 04:31:18.085
and we proclaim not just his death, but his resurrection

2682
04:31:18.105 --> 04:31:19.765
and the fact that he's coming back.

2683
04:31:20.985 --> 04:31:23.085
And so this is something we do in celebration

2684
04:31:23.185 --> 04:31:24.245
and remembrance, yes.

2685
04:31:24.265 --> 04:31:26.565
But also in celebration of the victory

2686
04:31:26.875 --> 04:31:29.045
that Jesus has won for himself.

2687
04:31:29.105 --> 04:31:32.845
So let's celebrate that today. Church, let me pray for us.

2688
04:31:33.625 --> 04:31:35.925
Father, we are so thankful.

2689
04:31:35.935 --> 04:31:37.845
Jesus, we are so thankful for you

2690
04:31:38.745 --> 04:31:40.965
and for how you have won this victory.

2691
04:31:41.145 --> 04:31:44.725
How you have made us a people unified in your body,

2692
04:31:45.035 --> 04:31:46.285
purchased by your blood.

2693
04:31:48.345 --> 04:31:52.205
God, remind us this morning just how great

2694
04:31:52.205 --> 04:31:54.045
of a king we have in Jesus

2695
04:31:55.465 --> 04:31:57.805
and make us more into the image of Him as we,

2696
04:31:58.225 --> 04:32:00.085
as we spur one another on.

2697
04:32:00.395 --> 04:32:03.525
Lord, we love you. It's your name. Amen.

2698
04:32:04.345 --> 04:32:09.085
So will you stand with us as we respond to that good news

2699
04:32:09.225 --> 04:32:10.925
and worshiping our king Jesus together

2700
04:32:29.185 --> 04:32:31.645
And all the saints,

2701
04:32:39.625 --> 04:32:43.525
throne and all

2702
04:32:45.385 --> 04:32:45.805
elders

2703
04:33:03.825 --> 04:33:04.285
of it,

2704
04:33:10.385 --> 04:33:11.405
you all,

2705
04:33:13.705 --> 04:33:18.405
You the

2706
04:34:50.325 --> 04:34:52.105
All this greater king Jesus,

2707
04:34:54.285 --> 04:34:56.505
he does deserve the glory this morning from his people.

2708
04:34:57.725 --> 04:35:00.105
So as he sing these lines, I say day and night.

2709
04:35:00.275 --> 04:35:02.105
Night and day, let incense rise.

2710
04:35:02.215 --> 04:35:06.105
It's the praise of his people rising up to him, giving him

2711
04:35:06.175 --> 04:35:07.785
what he is worthy of.

2712
04:35:10.765 --> 04:35:14.665
So as this church just sing this, lift your praise to him,

2713
04:35:15.175 --> 04:35:17.305
your hearts, your minds up to him

2714
04:36:59.845 --> 04:37:00.885
worthy of it.

2715
04:37:10.745 --> 04:37:15.565
You the

2716
04:37:49.945 --> 04:37:52.765
For from you are all things.

2717
04:37:54.105 --> 04:37:59.005
And until you're all things who you deserve

2718
04:37:59.935 --> 04:38:01.755
glory from.

2719
04:38:01.775 --> 04:38:03.475
You, Thomas,

2720
04:38:04.855 --> 04:38:07.315
for from you are all things.

2721
04:38:25.165 --> 04:38:27.115
Let's call out to our God This morning

2722
04:38:30.935 --> 04:38:33.395
I'm calling God

2723
04:38:38.375 --> 04:38:39.435

2724
04:38:45.865 --> 04:38:48.515

2725
04:38:48.695 --> 04:38:53.685

May the shepherd boy

2727
04:38:57.175 --> 04:38:58.175
Courageous.

2728
04:39:01.085 --> 04:39:02.485
I may not face,

2729
04:39:04.745 --> 04:39:07.205
but I've got my own shy.

2730
04:39:09.625 --> 04:39:12.525
Oh God, my God I need

2731
04:39:12.545 --> 04:39:13.545

I need God

2737
04:40:17.345 --> 04:40:19.325
And your children.

on your faithfulness.

2744
04:43:31.655 --> 04:43:36.635
We praise God for that faithfulness. Amen. Amen. Yep.

2745
04:43:37.905 --> 04:43:41.235
That is, that is, he is the rock.

2746
04:43:42.295 --> 04:43:46.075
Not this not situations being right. He is the rock.

2747
04:43:46.735 --> 04:43:49.355
His faithfulness to us is what we build our lives on.

2748
04:43:50.135 --> 04:43:52.795
And so you can, maybe you're struggling with that right now.

2749
04:43:52.795 --> 04:43:54.715
Don't know the answers, don't know what's coming,

2750
04:43:54.775 --> 04:43:56.875
what's next, how to handle situations.

2751
04:43:57.255 --> 04:43:58.275
If we can pray for you.

2752
04:43:58.465 --> 04:43:59.955
There's many women right here at the front

2753
04:44:00.205 --> 04:44:02.355
after every service, we'd love to pray for you

2754
04:44:02.855 --> 04:44:06.035
and just help kind of take that need to the throne of grace,

2755
04:44:06.295 --> 04:44:08.155
to find mercy and grace in our time of need.

2756
04:44:08.775 --> 04:44:11.395
We do need him. It's okay to admit that it's,

2757
04:44:11.465 --> 04:44:13.035
it's a safe place to admit

2758
04:44:13.035 --> 04:44:14.435
that you don't have it all together.

2759
04:44:15.295 --> 04:44:17.715
Uh, 'cause he does praise God for that. Thank you Lord.

2760
04:44:18.325 --> 04:44:21.755
Thank you for your grace and mercy to us today.

04:44:28.615 --> 04:44:32.435
of integrity that looks so different

2763
04:44:33.185 --> 04:44:34.915
because you've transformed us.

2764
04:44:36.345 --> 04:44:37.795
Holy Spirit, make that happen.

2765
04:44:37.905 --> 04:44:40.635
Help us one baby, step forward today.

2766
04:44:41.905 --> 04:44:43.915
Another one tomorrow, another one the next day

2767
04:44:43.915 --> 04:44:45.115
until we see you face to face.

2768
04:44:45.205 --> 04:44:49.405
Thank you God. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen.

2769
04:44:49.475 --> 04:44:51.325
Love you church. We are sent.
