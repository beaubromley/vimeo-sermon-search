00:00:04.205 --> 00:00:05.265
All throughout scripture,

2
00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:08.185
God's people clunked to his promises.

3
00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:13.385
Promises of a king who will come,

4
00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:19.145
a savior who will reign, a redeemer,

5
00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:21.305
who will bring light into the darkness.

6
00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:29.265
True Jesus. God's plan unfolds

7
00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:34.665
from promise to presents.

8
00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:43.185
Good morning church. It is truly a blessing

9
00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:46.705
to be in the presence of our Lord with you this morning.

10
00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.985
My name is Chris. I have the honor of serving, of getting

11
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.865
to serve as one of your elders here at Henderson Hills.

12
00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.705
If we've not met before, please, please come find me.

13
00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:56.905
I'm gonna stand up here at the

14
00:00:56.905 --> 00:00:58.025
end of the service, come find me.

15
00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:01.865
I'd love to meet you. And if you are new to Henderson Hills

16
00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:04.305
or perhaps you're visiting for the first time, first off,

17
00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:05.465
I just wanna say I'm thrilled

18
00:01:05.535 --> 00:01:07.425
that you are here this morning.

19
00:01:07.645 --> 00:01:10.705
Our hope is that you find community here

20
00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:14.785
and there's a couple of easy ways, uh, to get started there.

21
00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:16.505
One is out in the lobby

22
00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:18.345
after the services, there's an area

23
00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:19.545
out there called new here.

24
00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:21.985
If you go over there after the services,

25
00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:24.465
there'll be some people there that can, um,

26
00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:27.625
give you some resources, uh, introduce themselves

27
00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:30.065
and get you plugged in with Henderson Hills.

28
00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:33.305
The other even easier way to do that is in the back

29
00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:35.225
of your, uh, chairs.

30
00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:36.985
There's a QR code

31
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:39.265
or it's on, on the bulletin that you received as well.

32
00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.585
If you scan that QR code, fill out a little bit of info

33
00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:44.225
of your information and send that to us.

34
00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:45.865
Uh, we will reach out to you

35
00:01:45.865 --> 00:01:47.545
with some information about Henderson Hills

36
00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:49.785
and hopefully get you plugged in here.

37
00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:53.305
Well, today we uh, get

38
00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:57.705
to continue celebrating this Christmas season as we get

39
00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:00.905
to look at the promises that were fulfilled in the coming

40
00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:02.025
of our king Jesus.

41
00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:04.145
We started that last week

42
00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:05.705
and we get to continue this morning.

43
00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:08.985
And I'd like us to begin our time this morning in a

44
00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:10.425
Psalm, Psalm 10.

45
00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:13.025
It was written hundreds of years

46
00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:14.905
before that first Christmas season.

47
00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:19.345
But as I read this psalm, listen to the words here.

48
00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:25.105
The psalmist writes, why? Why?

49
00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:28.265
Oh Lord, do you stand so far away?

50
00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:34.985
Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble

51
00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:40.785
in arrogance, the wicked hotly pursue the poor.

52
00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.185
Let them be caught in the schemes that they've devised

53
00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:49.625
for the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul

54
00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:54.785
and the one greedy for gain, curses and renounces the Lord.

55
00:02:57.115 --> 00:03:00.885
In verse 12, he says, arise, oh Lord, oh God.

56
00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:05.205
Lift up your hand and forget not the afflicted.

57
00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:11.805
And then the psalmist ends by saying, oh Lord,

58
00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:15.685
you hear the desire of the afflicted,

59
00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:19.725
you will strengthen their heart

60
00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:23.245
and you will incline your ear to do justice

61
00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:26.045
to the fatherless and the oppressed.

62
00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:31.245
So that man who is of the earth may strike terror.

63
00:03:31.955 --> 00:03:32.955
Know more

64
00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:35.145
Why.

65
00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:39.845
Oh Lord, do you stand so far away?

66
00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:43.845
That's the question that the author

67
00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:46.725
of this psalm asks is he looks around him

68
00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:48.765
and he sees the oppression

69
00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:50.925
and injustices all around him in the world.

70
00:03:52.425 --> 00:03:55.325
And if we look around our world today, it's easy

71
00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:57.805
to echo this question as well.

72
00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:00.685
Why, Lord, do you seem so far away

73
00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:06.765
when we see over 300 students kidnapped from a Catholic

74
00:04:06.765 --> 00:04:11.405
school in Nigeria, when we hear of another mass shooting,

75
00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:15.845
when we see homeless sleeping under a bridge over

76
00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:20.605
by Penn Square Mall, when we experience broken families

77
00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:25.165
and see children left orphaned by absent parents, we ask,

78
00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:27.965
why do you stand so far away?

79
00:04:27.995 --> 00:04:32.695
Lord, across the globe we see rampant

80
00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:35.215
hunger, racism, abuse

81
00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:38.735
and war as we speak.

82
00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:40.695
As we sit here this morning, do you realize

83
00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:44.215
that there are over 28 million human beings

84
00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:47.815
being forced into labor, sold into sex trafficking?

85
00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:54.565
Sadly, this is not a new phenomenon.

86
00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:56.245
You know, generation

87
00:04:56.245 --> 00:04:59.445
after generation, humanity has continued

88
00:04:59.445 --> 00:05:04.245
to carry out injustices of the worst kinds, slavery,

89
00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:06.685
genocide, class systems.

90
00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:11.805
They all point to this human tendency to oppress

91
00:05:12.065 --> 00:05:15.085
and exploit others for our own personal gain.

92
00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:21.365
And the nation of Israel, to whom this psalmist belonged,

93
00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:24.485
was no stranger to oppression and injustice.

94
00:05:25.135 --> 00:05:28.285
Oppression that they experienced from both outside nations

95
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.245
but also from within.

96
00:05:31.745 --> 00:05:35.325
See, Israel was born out of slavery in Egypt,

97
00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:37.925
Israel had been conquered

98
00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:40.525
and led into exile by other nations,

99
00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:42.685
but it was also oppressed

100
00:05:42.705 --> 00:05:45.765
and abused by its own kings, its own elders

101
00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:47.725
and its own religious leaders.

102
00:05:50.045 --> 00:05:53.805
Although they were promised by God to be a great nation,

103
00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:57.325
a nation to whom all the other o other nations

104
00:05:57.325 --> 00:05:59.445
of the world would look to for blessing,

105
00:06:00.705 --> 00:06:04.725
Israel now found itself insignificant on the world stage

106
00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:08.765
under Roman occupation, paying taxes to a Caesar

107
00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:11.565
who declared himself to be God instead of Yahweh.

108
00:06:14.655 --> 00:06:18.755
So for generations, Israel had longed for a savior,

109
00:06:20.165 --> 00:06:23.805
a long awaited promise, Messiah King who had finally

110
00:06:24.715 --> 00:06:26.325
removed their oppression

111
00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:29.405
and reign with actual righteousness and justice.

112
00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:35.245
But yet here they were waiting

113
00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:40.485
and still asking why, oh Lord, do you stand

114
00:06:40.705 --> 00:06:41.725
so far away?

115
00:06:46.135 --> 00:06:48.315
But the Lord was not so far away

116
00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:53.145
on the contrary, as we saw last week,

117
00:06:55.045 --> 00:06:59.825
his presence was astonishingly near the very presence

118
00:06:59.845 --> 00:07:04.425
of the Lord was already here in an insignificant town in

119
00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:08.225
Galilee, in the womb of a young virgin girl.

120
00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:16.275
See, long did lay the world in sin and error pining,

121
00:07:16.275 --> 00:07:20.475
but a thrill of hope had already come and a new

122
00:07:20.535 --> 00:07:24.715
and glorious mourn was already dawning in Israel.

123
00:07:26.215 --> 00:07:28.275
And so I want to pick up this morning

124
00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:29.915
where we left off last week

125
00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:32.715
and see how that was already at work.

126
00:07:33.455 --> 00:07:37.635
So will you turn with me in God's word to Luke chapter one,

127
00:07:37.775 --> 00:07:40.075
and we're gonna pick back up in verse 39.

128
00:07:40.855 --> 00:07:42.555
That's where we ended off last week.

129
00:07:46.055 --> 00:07:49.235
And as you get to Luke one, let's, let's go

130
00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.595
to the Lord in prayer this morning.

131
00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:55.715
'cause we do need him. So God, I've I pray, father, I pray

132
00:07:55.715 --> 00:07:57.395
that you'll be with us this morning, spirit,

133
00:07:57.465 --> 00:08:00.835
will you open up our ears to hear your word

134
00:08:00.835 --> 00:08:05.275
and to hear it rightly Jesus, draw our attention to you.

135
00:08:07.375 --> 00:08:11.515
Let us see you for who you are, not for

136
00:08:11.515 --> 00:08:13.155
who we perceive you to be.

137
00:08:13.655 --> 00:08:15.835
But God, let us see you rightly this morning

138
00:08:15.935 --> 00:08:17.115
and let us glorify

139
00:08:17.115 --> 00:08:19.395
and magnify your name as we read your word.

140
00:08:20.225 --> 00:08:22.555
It's in your name we pray. Amen.

141
00:08:24.095 --> 00:08:28.675
So Luke chapter one, starting in verse 39, Luke writes,

142
00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:31.835
in those days, Mary arose

143
00:08:32.015 --> 00:08:34.195
and went with haste into the hill country

144
00:08:35.255 --> 00:08:39.275
to a town in Judah, and she entered the house of Zacharia

145
00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:41.115
and greeted Elizabeth.

146
00:08:41.215 --> 00:08:42.675
So let's, let's stop there

147
00:08:42.675 --> 00:08:44.035
and let's get our bearings for a second.

148
00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:49.315
So why was Mary in such a hurry here to go see Elizabeth?

149
00:08:50.305 --> 00:08:52.235
Well, if you remember back from last week,

150
00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:57.645
Mary has just had her world turned upside down an angel,

151
00:08:58.845 --> 00:09:03.165
a true to life angel, otherworldly spiritual being

152
00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:06.845
who called himself Gabriel, has just appeared to her

153
00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:08.925
and then delivered this bit of news to her.

154
00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:13.085
He says, he said, Hey Mary, you're going to have a son sun,

155
00:09:14.945 --> 00:09:17.605
and this sun is going to be king over Israel.

156
00:09:18.485 --> 00:09:21.485
I mean that in itself is pretty incredible news

157
00:09:21.485 --> 00:09:22.965
to hear from an angel, right?

158
00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:26.885
But then he says, it's not just gonna be any king,

159
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.965
a king whose reign will never end.

160
00:09:30.385 --> 00:09:32.925
And so the bells are probably going off from Mary at this

161
00:09:32.925 --> 00:09:36.005
point, realizing he's talking about the Messiah,

162
00:09:37.145 --> 00:09:39.525
the anointed one who has been promised

163
00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:41.445
to gen promised for generations.

164
00:09:42.705 --> 00:09:43.925
See, Mary's parents

165
00:09:43.985 --> 00:09:47.885
and her grandparents must have talked about the Messiah in

166
00:09:47.885 --> 00:09:51.205
their home all the time, thinking about

167
00:09:51.505 --> 00:09:55.725
how one day a Messiah would come to save them, the rabbis

168
00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:58.685
and the synagogue and Nazareth where Mary Mu

169
00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:00.685
and her family must have gone to every week,

170
00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:03.285
probably talked about the Messiah nearly every

171
00:10:03.285 --> 00:10:04.405
week that they went there.

172
00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:09.565
And yet this angel Gabriel just said that she,

173
00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:13.925
of all the women in Israel's history, was chosen by God

174
00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:16.485
to give birth to that Messiah King.

175
00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:21.205
And more than that, he said that this child

176
00:10:21.205 --> 00:10:24.925
that she would have is going to be God's son, literally

177
00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:29.085
conceived by the Holy Spirit in her womb.

178
00:10:29.675 --> 00:10:34.605
Somehow, even as a virgin, she was going to give birth

179
00:10:34.745 --> 00:10:36.285
to God's own child.

180
00:10:38.775 --> 00:10:41.515
Her head already spinning at this news.

181
00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:43.515
The angel doesn't stop there.

182
00:10:43.535 --> 00:10:45.155
He goes on to inform her

183
00:10:45.505 --> 00:10:47.995
that her much older relative Elizabeth

184
00:10:49.285 --> 00:10:50.585
was also pregnant,

185
00:10:51.015 --> 00:10:54.265
even though she had been barren all her years.

186
00:10:54.365 --> 00:10:56.785
And in her old age, she was gonna have a child.

187
00:10:58.685 --> 00:11:02.105
See God had made the impossible come true for her.

188
00:11:02.685 --> 00:11:06.385
And so Mary, considering all this, believes

189
00:11:06.385 --> 00:11:09.665
that God was going to do this seemingly impossible thing

190
00:11:09.725 --> 00:11:11.145
for her as well.

191
00:11:12.895 --> 00:11:16.985
Just put yourself in Mary's shoes for a second. What?

192
00:11:17.175 --> 00:11:19.225
What an afternoon that must have been for her, right?

193
00:11:19.285 --> 00:11:21.065
How do you even begin to process that?

194
00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:25.945
I can picture her friends coming over later that evening

195
00:11:26.165 --> 00:11:28.705
and maybe they're shooting the breeze talking about,

196
00:11:28.925 --> 00:11:31.065
you know, this great olive oil

197
00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:32.665
that they found at the market that morning.

198
00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:36.105
Or could you believe that traffic jam of goats

199
00:11:36.105 --> 00:11:37.585
that kept us from getting to the well earlier?

200
00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:38.665
That was unbelievable, right?

201
00:11:39.525 --> 00:11:40.745
And then they'd turn to Mary

202
00:11:40.765 --> 00:11:42.905
and they'd be like, so Mary, what's new in your world?

203
00:11:43.655 --> 00:11:46.625
Like what would she even say to them, right?

204
00:11:47.245 --> 00:11:50.025
How could they possibly understand what she's experiencing?

205
00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:56.365
So no wonder we find Mary hurrying off to see Elizabeth

206
00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:57.845
of all the people in the world.

207
00:11:57.845 --> 00:12:01.445
Perhaps she can relate to what she's just experienced.

208
00:12:03.865 --> 00:12:07.005
Now, I don't know if first trimester morning sickness is a

209
00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:08.325
thing when you're carrying the son of God,

210
00:12:09.305 --> 00:12:12.965
but I can't imagine that this 90 mile journey from Galilee

211
00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:15.085
to Judah was easy on a pregnant woman,

212
00:12:15.625 --> 00:12:17.245
but props to Mary, she does it.

213
00:12:17.995 --> 00:12:19.245
That also reminds me

214
00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:22.205
that I think pregnancy is like the only human

215
00:12:22.205 --> 00:12:23.525
superpower we really have.

216
00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:25.965
You women are like terrifyingly tough when you're pregnant.

217
00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:31.205
And yet anyways, Mary makes it to Elizabeth's home.

218
00:12:32.825 --> 00:12:36.245
And when she arrives, let's look at Elizabeth's reaction.

219
00:12:38.995 --> 00:12:41.065
Start starting in verse 41 says,

220
00:12:41.065 --> 00:12:43.905
and when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary,

221
00:12:43.965 --> 00:12:45.625
the baby leaped in her womb

222
00:12:47.245 --> 00:12:50.225
and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit

223
00:12:50.365 --> 00:12:52.865
and she exclaimed with a loud cry.

224
00:12:53.135 --> 00:12:54.985
Blessed are you among women

225
00:12:56.285 --> 00:12:58.505
and blessed is the fruit of your womb.

226
00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:02.825
And why is this granted to me that the mother

227
00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:07.145
of my Lord should come to me for behold,

228
00:13:07.145 --> 00:13:09.585
when the sound of your greeting came to my ears,

229
00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:11.865
the baby in my womb leaped for joy

230
00:13:13.365 --> 00:13:15.065
and blessed is she who believed

231
00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:17.105
that there would be a fulfillment of

232
00:13:17.105 --> 00:13:18.665
what was spoken to her from the Lord.

233
00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:22.385
What a greeting to receive when you walk

234
00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.425
into someone's home, right?

235
00:13:24.255 --> 00:13:27.025
When my family gets together, we usually greet each other

236
00:13:27.025 --> 00:13:29.905
with like, Hey, did you see the Cowboys game last week?

237
00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.545
Nothing like this.

238
00:13:34.445 --> 00:13:37.385
But you see, when Mary walks into Elizabeth

239
00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:40.065
and Zacharia's home, she's not just gracing them

240
00:13:40.065 --> 00:13:41.065
with her own presence.

241
00:13:42.085 --> 00:13:46.385
Now in her womb, she's carrying the very presence of God

242
00:13:47.015 --> 00:13:49.905
into their home and the presence

243
00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:52.745
of Jesus brings blessing with it.

244
00:13:56.375 --> 00:13:58.555
See, as we get into this Christmas season,

245
00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:01.515
and I realize some of you guys have already been at it since

246
00:14:01.515 --> 00:14:04.875
like August, looking at you, hobby lobby,

247
00:14:06.355 --> 00:14:08.435
I always, I always think it's funny the juxtaposition

248
00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:10.915
of like Halloween direct decorations

249
00:14:10.915 --> 00:14:12.675
and Christmas decorations at the same time.

250
00:14:13.345 --> 00:14:15.715
It's like they're in this battle, but Christmas wins.

251
00:14:16.695 --> 00:14:19.155
So anyways, as we celebrate Christmas, one

252
00:14:19.155 --> 00:14:22.235
of the things I love seeing is all the nativity sets.

253
00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:26.075
My mom always had tons of these in our home growing up.

254
00:14:27.585 --> 00:14:28.875
When we think of Christmas

255
00:14:28.975 --> 00:14:31.235
and we celebrate Christmas, we think of nativity.

256
00:14:32.215 --> 00:14:35.835
We think of the birth of Jesus, we think of the manger

257
00:14:37.015 --> 00:14:41.595
and the star, the angels, the shepherds, the wise men.

258
00:14:42.175 --> 00:14:43.675
We think of Mary and Joseph,

259
00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:48.075
and of course we think of baby Jesus, God's son,

260
00:14:48.535 --> 00:14:52.805
the Savior Christ, finally born, finally come to earth.

261
00:14:54.265 --> 00:14:58.685
But looking here at this passage, I see something that our,

262
00:14:58.785 --> 00:15:00.725
our nativity sets are missing.

263
00:15:02.265 --> 00:15:04.885
Do you notice here that the shepherds were not the first

264
00:15:05.075 --> 00:15:08.365
ones to leap for joy at the coming of the of the Messiah?

265
00:15:10.065 --> 00:15:11.725
No, it says it was. It was John

266
00:15:12.895 --> 00:15:14.965
while still in his own mother's tummy.

267
00:15:15.065 --> 00:15:18.645
He can't contain himself at the near presence of Jesus.

268
00:15:18.755 --> 00:15:20.445
When Mary walks into the room,

269
00:15:21.985 --> 00:15:23.965
and he must have really been jumping in there

270
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:26.485
because Elizabeth notices this isn't just any other kick

271
00:15:28.545 --> 00:15:31.285
you see before he is even born,

272
00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:34.605
Jesus is already filling the hearts of his people

273
00:15:35.155 --> 00:15:36.925
with overflowing joy.

274
00:15:39.065 --> 00:15:42.325
And it's not just John affected by the presence of Jesus.

275
00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:44.645
Notice Elizabeth's reaction.

276
00:15:46.255 --> 00:15:47.405
Verse 40 tells us,

277
00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:50.365
and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit

278
00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:53.565
and she exclaimed with a loud cry.

279
00:15:54.065 --> 00:15:55.125
So did you catch that?

280
00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:58.885
This wasn't your typical Oh, sweet Mary, welcome

281
00:15:58.905 --> 00:16:00.165
to our home kind of greeting.

282
00:16:00.265 --> 00:16:04.925
No, she's getting loud. And why is she getting loud

283
00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:07.005
in her home is

284
00:16:07.005 --> 00:16:10.125
because the Holy Spirit is doing a work there.

285
00:16:11.065 --> 00:16:14.265
Notice that John

286
00:16:16.325 --> 00:16:18.745
has already been filled with the Holy Spirit as a baby.

287
00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:20.265
We saw that back in verse 15,

288
00:16:20.365 --> 00:16:22.145
and he's in that womb just jumping.

289
00:16:23.925 --> 00:16:27.825
And Mary, pregnant Mary has raced to visit Elizabeth

290
00:16:27.825 --> 00:16:30.865
after just having the Holy Spirit overshadow her.

291
00:16:32.035 --> 00:16:35.825
Jesus is in Mary's tummy, literally concede with the DNA

292
00:16:35.825 --> 00:16:39.425
of the Holy Spirit and the only other human in this room,

293
00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:42.865
Elizabeth, is filled with the Holy Spirit

294
00:16:42.965 --> 00:16:45.465
and is now screaming at the coming of Jesus.

295
00:16:46.445 --> 00:16:48.865
People of God. There is a time for everything.

296
00:16:49.955 --> 00:16:52.585
There is a time to weep and a time to laugh.

297
00:16:52.585 --> 00:16:55.385
There's a time to mourn and a time to dance.

298
00:16:55.445 --> 00:16:57.585
And you better believe that the presence

299
00:16:57.585 --> 00:17:00.025
of the Messiah is a time to get a little bit rowdy.

300
00:17:00.175 --> 00:17:02.705
Amen in, oh, come on.

301
00:17:03.335 --> 00:17:05.625
I've been to, I've been to Mahjong nights

302
00:17:05.695 --> 00:17:06.865
that are rowdier than that.

303
00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:10.465
We're, we're talking about Jesus here.

304
00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:14.905
He's the Messiah, the anointed one, the root

305
00:17:14.925 --> 00:17:16.785
of Jesse from the line of David.

306
00:17:17.855 --> 00:17:20.665
He's the king of kings, the Lord of Lords,

307
00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.025
the alpha and the Omega.

308
00:17:22.965 --> 00:17:25.385
He is the Lord of all creation by him

309
00:17:25.765 --> 00:17:29.185
and for him, all things in heaven and earth exist.

310
00:17:29.325 --> 00:17:32.625
He is the only righteous one, the spotless lamb

311
00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:34.185
and the author of our salvation.

312
00:17:34.445 --> 00:17:38.305
He is the prince of peace, the wonderful counselor,

313
00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:39.585
the mighty God.

314
00:17:40.445 --> 00:17:43.705
He came to earth, he proclaimed freedom to the captives.

315
00:17:43.925 --> 00:17:46.825
He was crucified on a cross, buried in a tomb

316
00:17:47.005 --> 00:17:48.065
and raised to life.

317
00:17:48.075 --> 00:17:50.845
Three days later, he ascended to the Father

318
00:17:50.845 --> 00:17:54.325
where he sits now at the right hand interceding on our

319
00:17:54.325 --> 00:17:55.805
behalf as the great high priest.

320
00:17:56.105 --> 00:17:59.765
And he's coming back one day to redeem all of his creation

321
00:17:59.765 --> 00:18:01.045
and make all things new.

322
00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:03.085
This, this is Jesus

323
00:18:03.905 --> 00:18:06.365
and his presence is worth getting rowdy for.

324
00:18:06.815 --> 00:18:11.605
Right? This

325
00:18:11.825 --> 00:18:13.725
is why Elizabeth got loud

326
00:18:15.705 --> 00:18:19.045
and look at the blessing that flows out of her.

327
00:18:20.455 --> 00:18:24.605
First. She claims that Mary is blessed among women.

328
00:18:25.985 --> 00:18:28.205
Now, millions of women have been blessed

329
00:18:28.305 --> 00:18:29.965
by the Lord to carry a child.

330
00:18:30.715 --> 00:18:33.845
Even Elizabeth herself is experiencing immense blessing

331
00:18:34.305 --> 00:18:35.405
in that way, right?

332
00:18:35.535 --> 00:18:38.805
Right. That moment. And don't get me wrong, the creation

333
00:18:38.825 --> 00:18:42.445
of life inside the mother's womb is a miracle in it itself.

334
00:18:43.865 --> 00:18:47.485
Yet Mary's blessing goes beyond just mere pregnancy.

335
00:18:48.355 --> 00:18:50.885
Elizabeth gives this second blessing

336
00:18:50.985 --> 00:18:52.605
to the child that she's carrying.

337
00:18:53.545 --> 00:18:56.965
See, Elizabeth filled with the Holy Spirit recognizes

338
00:18:56.965 --> 00:19:00.205
that this isn't just any baby that Mary is carrying.

339
00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:05.675
No. Elizabeth in faith

340
00:19:07.895 --> 00:19:09.675
in humility, she exclaims.

341
00:19:09.975 --> 00:19:13.315
Why is this granted to me that the mother

342
00:19:13.375 --> 00:19:16.075
of my Lord should come to me?

343
00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:21.125
Amazing faith that Elizabeth has, that she believes

344
00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:22.765
that the, that the baby

345
00:19:22.765 --> 00:19:26.605
that Mary is carrying is the Messiah king.

346
00:19:27.025 --> 00:19:31.605
She calls him her Lord even though she can't see or touch

347
00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:33.405
or even hold him yet.

348
00:19:35.185 --> 00:19:38.565
So can you imagine what this church would look like,

349
00:19:38.635 --> 00:19:42.525
what our lives would look like if we carried that same

350
00:19:43.325 --> 00:19:46.645
humility in our approach to the king, that we had this

351
00:19:47.445 --> 00:19:50.605
humility in us that says, why is it granted to us

352
00:19:51.275 --> 00:19:54.605
that we could even be in the presence of you, king Jesus?

353
00:19:56.715 --> 00:20:00.015
Our lives would look drastically different.

354
00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:05.105
And then finally, Elizabeth offers a third blessing

355
00:20:05.835 --> 00:20:08.665
again on Mary that she is blessed.

356
00:20:08.805 --> 00:20:12.385
But take note of the reason is not

357
00:20:12.385 --> 00:20:15.825
because she is worthy of blessing for her righteousness or

358
00:20:15.825 --> 00:20:18.665
because of her status in society is not

359
00:20:18.945 --> 00:20:21.505
because she somehow earned this pregnancy

360
00:20:21.505 --> 00:20:23.625
with her meekness or her humility.

361
00:20:25.285 --> 00:20:28.105
No, Elizabeth says that Mary is blessed

362
00:20:28.105 --> 00:20:31.785
because she believed in the promises of God.

363
00:20:33.925 --> 00:20:37.465
So don't miss this critical facet of God's blessing.

364
00:20:37.525 --> 00:20:40.305
It is not something that we earn by doing.

365
00:20:41.415 --> 00:20:44.545
It's something that we receive by believing.

366
00:20:45.325 --> 00:20:48.445
Yes, Mary was blessed among women, but it was

367
00:20:48.445 --> 00:20:51.805
because God chose to work in her to do a great

368
00:20:51.805 --> 00:20:52.805
and marvelous thing.

369
00:20:52.825 --> 00:20:57.085
And Mary in faith believed that it would come to pass.

370
00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:03.085
Now get this 30 years from this moment,

371
00:21:04.095 --> 00:21:06.485
Jesus has grown and he's in his ministry

372
00:21:07.785 --> 00:21:09.205
and he encounters this woman

373
00:21:09.265 --> 00:21:12.125
who delivers a very similar blessing on his mom.

374
00:21:12.275 --> 00:21:17.005
Mary, check this out. It's in chapter 11, verse 27.

375
00:21:18.145 --> 00:21:21.285
And Luke writes, he says, as Jesus said these things,

376
00:21:21.525 --> 00:21:24.165
a woman in the crowd raised her voice

377
00:21:24.265 --> 00:21:27.525
and said to him, blessed is the womb that bore you

378
00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:29.285
and the breasts at which you nursed.

379
00:21:31.505 --> 00:21:34.565
But see Jesus's response to her, he says,

380
00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:38.485
blessed rather are those who hear the word

381
00:21:38.485 --> 00:21:39.765
of God and keep it.

382
00:21:42.195 --> 00:21:43.895
So do you see what Jesus does here?

383
00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:49.975
Is he ignoring or is he discounting the blessing on his mom?

384
00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:53.975
On Mary? No, Jesus loves his mother,

385
00:21:55.675 --> 00:22:00.215
but Jesus is pointing out something here that Mary was one

386
00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:04.215
who heard the word of God, the promises that he made to her,

387
00:22:04.795 --> 00:22:08.175
and she believed and she was blessed.

388
00:22:10.035 --> 00:22:12.735
Listen, my friends, this is my ask of you this morning.

389
00:22:14.115 --> 00:22:15.895
If you hear his word,

390
00:22:16.555 --> 00:22:21.135
if you hear his voice declaring these realities about

391
00:22:21.195 --> 00:22:23.255
who this Jesus is that we worship

392
00:22:23.435 --> 00:22:24.735
and celebrate at Christmas,

393
00:22:25.475 --> 00:22:28.175
and if you hear his promise to be our savior,

394
00:22:28.395 --> 00:22:32.135
to be your savior believe,

395
00:22:33.765 --> 00:22:38.695
believe that he is the Lord, the Messiah, the Son

396
00:22:38.855 --> 00:22:42.745
of God, and the blessing that comes

397
00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:45.865
with God's presence belongs to you,

398
00:22:48.765 --> 00:22:51.465
why would you wait another second

399
00:22:51.925 --> 00:22:53.385
and miss out on that blessing?

400
00:22:57.425 --> 00:23:01.885
So Mary encouraged by the blessing of her dear relative

401
00:23:02.745 --> 00:23:06.965
bursts out and praise of her Lord, the Lord

402
00:23:06.965 --> 00:23:09.365
that she's presently carrying inside of her,

403
00:23:10.425 --> 00:23:12.885
and she exclaims with the most powerful hymns

404
00:23:12.885 --> 00:23:14.325
that we have recorded in scripture.

405
00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:17.605
It's been known for centuries in the church

406
00:23:17.825 --> 00:23:21.845
as the magnifico, which comes from the Latin translation

407
00:23:21.845 --> 00:23:25.365
of the first line of the song, but I don't know Latin.

408
00:23:25.745 --> 00:23:27.725
So we're gonna read this in English together,

409
00:23:28.345 --> 00:23:29.405
and it goes like this.

410
00:23:30.905 --> 00:23:33.845
My soul magnifies the Lord

411
00:23:35.265 --> 00:23:39.445
and my spirit rejoices in God my savior,

412
00:23:41.075 --> 00:23:43.975
for he has looked on the humblest state of his servant.

413
00:23:44.275 --> 00:23:46.685
For behold, from now on,

414
00:23:46.945 --> 00:23:49.485
all generations will call me blessed,

415
00:23:51.665 --> 00:23:55.965
for he who is mighty, has done great things for me.

416
00:23:56.025 --> 00:23:58.645
And holy is his name.

417
00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:03.605
His mercy is for those who fear him

418
00:24:04.275 --> 00:24:06.165
from generation to generation.

419
00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:08.285
He has shown strength with his arm.

420
00:24:09.225 --> 00:24:12.325
He has scattered the proud and the thoughts of their hearts.

421
00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:15.565
He has brought down the mighty from their thrones

422
00:24:15.585 --> 00:24:18.205
and exalted those of humble estate.

423
00:24:19.945 --> 00:24:23.165
He has filled the hungry with good things

424
00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:27.085
and the rich he has sent away empty.

425
00:24:29.295 --> 00:24:32.955
He has helped his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy

426
00:24:33.655 --> 00:24:36.275
as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham

427
00:24:36.335 --> 00:24:38.235
and to his offspring forever.

428
00:24:39.165 --> 00:24:43.875
Young Mary, dear mother of our Lord Jesus, how beautiful

429
00:24:43.935 --> 00:24:48.315
and powerful of praise, your words of praise are still

430
00:24:48.375 --> 00:24:52.665
to this day and how rich they are as they speak

431
00:24:52.665 --> 00:24:55.865
of God's fulfilled promises to his people, both

432
00:24:55.885 --> 00:24:58.945
to her individually, but also to all of his people.

433
00:25:01.415 --> 00:25:05.145
This hymn of Mary's, while only a few lines long,

434
00:25:05.245 --> 00:25:09.105
is absolutely just saturated with the Hebrew scriptures.

435
00:25:12.005 --> 00:25:13.405
I wanna draw your attention to this.

436
00:25:14.225 --> 00:25:18.365
So as we look at Mary's hymn, notice

437
00:25:18.395 --> 00:25:22.885
that every single line, every single line

438
00:25:22.945 --> 00:25:27.165
of her hymn pulls directly from the Hebrew scriptures

439
00:25:27.165 --> 00:25:29.005
of the Old Testament, as we would call it,

440
00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:33.045
and not just one reference, there's multiple reference.

441
00:25:33.075 --> 00:25:35.525
It's just saturated with with the word.

442
00:25:36.665 --> 00:25:40.045
See, Mary, even as a young girl, a young teenage girl,

443
00:25:40.145 --> 00:25:41.845
she was well versed in the scripture

444
00:25:42.585 --> 00:25:45.205
and it's obvious that she has stored up God's

445
00:25:45.205 --> 00:25:46.285
word in her heart.

446
00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:48.125
It just flows out

447
00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:50.645
of everything she says in her praise of the Lord.

448
00:25:52.105 --> 00:25:55.925
And she sees the entirety of all the Old Testament as coming

449
00:25:55.925 --> 00:25:58.605
to fruition in whatever God was doing

450
00:25:58.705 --> 00:26:00.685
inside her womb at that very moment.

451
00:26:02.405 --> 00:26:04.045
I mean, let that sink in for a second.

452
00:26:04.115 --> 00:26:07.605
That thousands of years of human history

453
00:26:08.585 --> 00:26:11.965
are all leading up to this very moment

454
00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:15.965
and that very room that she stood in with Elizabeth.

455
00:26:18.825 --> 00:26:23.685
And as she considers the weight of that moment, Mary is

456
00:26:24.325 --> 00:26:27.005
overcome with humility before her Lord.

457
00:26:29.575 --> 00:26:31.115
But as we'll see in her song

458
00:26:31.935 --> 00:26:35.515
and the mercy of God lifts up for lowly.

459
00:26:37.315 --> 00:26:39.695
See, Mary begins her song

460
00:26:39.795 --> 00:26:42.335
by pointing all attention to the Lord.

461
00:26:42.475 --> 00:26:43.845
She says, my soul,

462
00:26:44.745 --> 00:26:49.645
or it could be translated my life, my being the very essence

463
00:26:49.665 --> 00:26:54.285
of who I am, magnifies, enlarges,

464
00:26:54.375 --> 00:26:59.125
makes great of draws attention to the Lord the Messiah.

465
00:27:00.615 --> 00:27:04.365
She's recognizing that all of her being exists to make much

466
00:27:04.465 --> 00:27:06.445
of Jesus and to glorify him.

467
00:27:08.225 --> 00:27:10.765
And she goes on exclaiming that her spirit

468
00:27:11.885 --> 00:27:15.965
rejoices it's abundantly glad because of God, her savior,

469
00:27:17.265 --> 00:27:20.245
and notice that she uses Savior in a very

470
00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:23.085
personal way, my savior.

471
00:27:23.625 --> 00:27:27.645
She says, this young lady knows

472
00:27:27.645 --> 00:27:30.445
that she is in desperate need of being saved

473
00:27:31.425 --> 00:27:33.285
and the one that she's carrying is gonna be

474
00:27:33.285 --> 00:27:34.365
the one that's going to save her.

475
00:27:36.825 --> 00:27:38.525
She continues on in humility,

476
00:27:39.565 --> 00:27:42.525
recognizing her lowly position before God.

477
00:27:43.665 --> 00:27:46.125
She says, for he has looked on the humblest state

478
00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:49.925
of his servant, Mary acknowledges

479
00:27:49.925 --> 00:27:51.685
that there is nothing in her position

480
00:27:51.745 --> 00:27:53.405
or status that makes her desirable

481
00:27:53.585 --> 00:27:56.045
for such an honorable task as this.

482
00:27:56.225 --> 00:28:01.205
Yet God in his might has chosen to make much of her life

483
00:28:01.205 --> 00:28:05.785
through Jesus, and all she can respond with

484
00:28:06.605 --> 00:28:09.905
is just awestruck wonder at her God.

485
00:28:11.545 --> 00:28:12.915
Holy is his name.

486
00:28:13.055 --> 00:28:16.395
She bursts out, he is set

487
00:28:16.525 --> 00:28:18.275
apart, he is other.

488
00:28:18.945 --> 00:28:21.435
There's nothing that can compare to him.

489
00:28:21.665 --> 00:28:23.115
He's in a league of his own.

490
00:28:25.095 --> 00:28:28.875
And then with the rest of her song, Mary illustrates just

491
00:28:29.055 --> 00:28:32.315
how holy, how set apart, how different he is

492
00:28:34.455 --> 00:28:36.995
as she considers her own circumstances.

493
00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.115
And then as she thinks

494
00:28:39.115 --> 00:28:41.555
and reflects on how God has shown his power

495
00:28:41.615 --> 00:28:43.755
and his faithfulness throughout all of scripture,

496
00:28:44.485 --> 00:28:46.875
she's enraptured by this fact

497
00:28:48.705 --> 00:28:50.195
that God shows his mercy

498
00:28:50.295 --> 00:28:52.635
and his power through the weaknesses

499
00:28:52.735 --> 00:28:55.625
of his people, not their might.

500
00:28:57.625 --> 00:29:00.145
I love how David Mathis puts this.

501
00:29:00.145 --> 00:29:03.225
He says, Mary celebrates the kind of God he is

502
00:29:04.015 --> 00:29:07.465
different than us, shattering our paradigms

503
00:29:08.085 --> 00:29:11.665
as he shows his strength, not by recruiting the strong,

504
00:29:12.765 --> 00:29:14.505
but by rescuing the weak.

505
00:29:16.425 --> 00:29:17.965
See, when men want to be great,

506
00:29:18.835 --> 00:29:20.925
they surround themselves with a great team.

507
00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:23.165
That's why the Oklahoma City thunder are so great, right?

508
00:29:24.035 --> 00:29:26.565
Yeah, yeah. Hey, you better amen.

509
00:29:26.565 --> 00:29:27.925
Like that when we talk about Jesus too, Joe,

510
00:29:32.065 --> 00:29:33.285
but they're, they're a team

511
00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:36.445
of highly talented individuals surrounding themselves

512
00:29:36.445 --> 00:29:38.645
with other highly talented individuals.

513
00:29:39.865 --> 00:29:44.165
But you see, God doesn't need anyone to be great.

514
00:29:44.835 --> 00:29:46.325
He's great all on his own.

515
00:29:46.425 --> 00:29:50.245
And contrary to our thinking, God shows his greatness

516
00:29:50.305 --> 00:29:54.005
by being with the poor and the lowly.

517
00:29:55.235 --> 00:29:58.565
This God rallies to the weak, not the strong.

518
00:30:00.785 --> 00:30:03.365
See, God's ways are not our ways.

519
00:30:03.855 --> 00:30:07.525
God's kingdom upends the kingdoms of this world.

520
00:30:09.295 --> 00:30:12.675
And see here how Mary demonstrates this.

521
00:30:13.605 --> 00:30:17.955
First she points out his mercy is

522
00:30:18.115 --> 00:30:19.915
for those who fear him.

523
00:30:22.015 --> 00:30:26.515
Notice it's for those who fear him, not those

524
00:30:26.695 --> 00:30:29.275
who impress him or win his respect.

525
00:30:30.655 --> 00:30:32.995
But that's what our conventional wisdom would say.

526
00:30:34.585 --> 00:30:36.765
But to those who had aim to make a name

527
00:30:36.765 --> 00:30:40.485
for themselves instead of God, see what God's position is.

528
00:30:41.865 --> 00:30:44.005
She says He has shown strength with his arm

529
00:30:44.465 --> 00:30:46.085
and he has scattered the proud

530
00:30:46.105 --> 00:30:47.405
and the thoughts of their hearts.

531
00:30:48.145 --> 00:30:51.445
He has brought down the mighty from their thrones.

532
00:30:51.785 --> 00:30:54.405
See, foolish are we when we think that anything

533
00:30:54.405 --> 00:30:56.965
that we can accomplish or acquire

534
00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:59.685
or possess will make us great.

535
00:30:59.955 --> 00:31:02.965
None of it, none of it earns God's mercy.

536
00:31:04.515 --> 00:31:08.405
None of it can remotely compare to his greatness.

537
00:31:10.545 --> 00:31:13.725
Our lives biggest accomplishments are considered just

538
00:31:14.075 --> 00:31:17.965
rubbish in comparison to the surpassing glory

539
00:31:17.965 --> 00:31:19.205
of knowing our king Jesus.

540
00:31:22.545 --> 00:31:25.485
But if our achievements don't impress the

541
00:31:25.485 --> 00:31:27.125
Lord, then what does?

542
00:31:28.775 --> 00:31:31.185
What grabs the attention of the king?

543
00:31:34.015 --> 00:31:37.665
Well, Mary tells us in verse 52, she says,

544
00:31:37.665 --> 00:31:40.065
he has exalted those of humble estate.

545
00:31:41.515 --> 00:31:43.895
He has filled the hungry with good things

546
00:31:44.755 --> 00:31:47.295
and the rich he has sent away empty.

547
00:31:48.855 --> 00:31:50.595
He has helped his servant Israel

548
00:31:50.595 --> 00:31:54.235
and remembrance of his mercy as we as he spoke

549
00:31:54.255 --> 00:31:57.475
to our fathers, to Abraham and his offspring forever.

550
00:31:57.695 --> 00:32:00.915
You see, the king's eyes are on the lowly.

551
00:32:02.335 --> 00:32:05.955
He sees the poor, the humbled, the hungry.

552
00:32:07.455 --> 00:32:10.595
He notices and is drawn to the one who knows just

553
00:32:10.655 --> 00:32:12.115
how needy they are.

554
00:32:13.975 --> 00:32:15.955
He responds to the down chardon

555
00:32:16.135 --> 00:32:18.955
and goes out of his way to look for the outcast.

556
00:32:20.265 --> 00:32:23.395
He's the king of a people who are in need of mercy

557
00:32:23.395 --> 00:32:26.715
because they are hopelessly broken in their own sins.

558
00:32:30.425 --> 00:32:34.125
As we read on in Luke's account of Jesus's life.

559
00:32:35.315 --> 00:32:37.045
It's no coincidence that we find

560
00:32:37.575 --> 00:32:40.565
Jesus preaching this same message at the

561
00:32:40.565 --> 00:32:41.685
beginning of his ministry.

562
00:32:43.065 --> 00:32:46.005
In Luke four, we see Jesus reciting from Isaiah.

563
00:32:46.185 --> 00:32:48.845
He says, the spirit of the Lord is upon me

564
00:32:49.635 --> 00:32:51.405
because he has anointed me

565
00:32:51.585 --> 00:32:53.725
to proclaim good news to the poor.

566
00:32:54.865 --> 00:32:57.845
He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives

567
00:32:57.845 --> 00:33:02.125
and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty those

568
00:33:02.225 --> 00:33:06.165
who are oppressed, to proclaim the year

569
00:33:06.625 --> 00:33:08.245
of the Lord's favor.

570
00:33:09.595 --> 00:33:12.895
And then he says, today this scripture has been fulfilled.

571
00:33:13.235 --> 00:33:16.575
And your hearing, you see, those are the kind

572
00:33:16.575 --> 00:33:20.295
of people whom this anointed one, this Messiah king desires

573
00:33:20.515 --> 00:33:21.815
to fill his kingdom with.

574
00:33:23.225 --> 00:33:26.295
Those are who this Messiah king who Mary will give birth

575
00:33:26.295 --> 00:33:28.695
to in nine short months has come

576
00:33:28.695 --> 00:33:30.655
to bring unimaginable blessing to.

577
00:33:32.195 --> 00:33:35.455
And that's why Mary can't help but sing

578
00:33:36.845 --> 00:33:38.615
because the blessed can't help

579
00:33:38.755 --> 00:33:41.455
but rejoice in God's presence.

580
00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:48.075
So in light of all of this, I want you to consider

581
00:33:48.075 --> 00:33:51.235
with me this morning, who is blessed among us?

582
00:33:53.255 --> 00:33:55.955
Is that the rich, the powerful,

583
00:33:56.445 --> 00:33:58.395
those highly esteemed in society?

584
00:33:59.855 --> 00:34:01.115
Is it the popular ones?

585
00:34:03.535 --> 00:34:05.795
Are they the blessed ones who are self-sufficient,

586
00:34:05.795 --> 00:34:08.595
having no shortage of friends, social status

587
00:34:08.775 --> 00:34:10.955
or comforts those with the biggest house

588
00:34:10.975 --> 00:34:14.275
or the important job or the high position in the church?

589
00:34:15.935 --> 00:34:17.115
The world might say so,

590
00:34:17.115 --> 00:34:19.395
and if we're honest with ourselves, we might even think so.

591
00:34:21.905 --> 00:34:24.125
But hear what Jesus, the Son of Mary

592
00:34:25.195 --> 00:34:26.805
says about such assumptions.

593
00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:28.645
This is in Luke six.

594
00:34:30.655 --> 00:34:33.245
Jesus says, wo to you who are rich,

595
00:34:34.585 --> 00:34:39.295
for you've received your constellation wo to you

596
00:34:39.475 --> 00:34:42.615
who are full now for you will be hungry,

597
00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:48.695
wo to you who laugh now for going to mourn

598
00:34:48.695 --> 00:34:52.315
and weep wo to you

599
00:34:52.335 --> 00:34:56.275
and all people speak well of you for so their fathers did

600
00:34:56.275 --> 00:34:57.315
to the false prophets.

601
00:34:59.335 --> 00:35:01.395
You see, Jesus grieves for those

602
00:35:01.535 --> 00:35:03.795
who are lulled into ignorance by their pursuit

603
00:35:03.795 --> 00:35:07.115
of worldly success, chasing

604
00:35:07.125 --> 00:35:09.755
after false securities they thank into themselves.

605
00:35:10.305 --> 00:35:13.275
Nothing bad is ever going to happen to us.

606
00:35:14.365 --> 00:35:15.715
Their hope is in themselves

607
00:35:16.455 --> 00:35:19.115
and they're too proud to see God.

608
00:35:19.215 --> 00:35:22.235
The God who gives life and gives it abundantly.

609
00:35:24.855 --> 00:35:28.915
But take note of whom Jesus says are the truly blessed just

610
00:35:29.075 --> 00:35:33.675
before then it says, blessed are you who are poor.

611
00:35:35.015 --> 00:35:36.715
For yours is the kingdom of God.

612
00:35:38.515 --> 00:35:40.765
Blessed are you who are hungry now

613
00:35:40.865 --> 00:35:42.765
for you will be satisfied.

614
00:35:44.115 --> 00:35:47.485
Blessed are you who weep now for you will laugh.

615
00:35:49.075 --> 00:35:51.325
Blessed are you when people hate you

616
00:35:52.145 --> 00:35:54.805
and when they exclude you and revile you

617
00:35:54.945 --> 00:35:58.765
and spur your name as evil on account of the son of man,

618
00:35:59.525 --> 00:36:04.405
rejoice in that day and leap for joy like John

619
00:36:04.465 --> 00:36:05.485
and his mother's tummy.

620
00:36:05.715 --> 00:36:10.165
Leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven.

621
00:36:10.305 --> 00:36:14.325
For so their fathers did to the prophets, Jesus says,

622
00:36:14.545 --> 00:36:19.185
the poor, the hungry, those who weep,

623
00:36:20.165 --> 00:36:23.145
the excluded, the reviled, the hated

624
00:36:24.205 --> 00:36:27.345
who clinging desperately to Jesus, the son of man.

625
00:36:27.725 --> 00:36:32.705
His kingdom is for them like it was

626
00:36:32.925 --> 00:36:34.065
for the unclean

627
00:36:34.485 --> 00:36:39.005
and rejected leper like it was

628
00:36:39.145 --> 00:36:43.995
for a demon possessed lunatic like it was

629
00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:47.035
for a ragtag group of sinful fishermen.

630
00:36:47.735 --> 00:36:51.315
His kingdom is for a desperately dependent paralytic

631
00:36:51.315 --> 00:36:54.835
and for an immoral woman despised by the religious elites.

632
00:36:56.735 --> 00:36:58.115
His kingdom is for the widow

633
00:36:58.655 --> 00:37:02.115
and for the orphan, his kingdom is

634
00:37:02.115 --> 00:37:05.515
for a rich tax collector, humbled beating his chest,

635
00:37:05.535 --> 00:37:08.675
crying out, God be merciful to me a sinner.

636
00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:13.795
It is for a wandering lost sheep

637
00:37:14.135 --> 00:37:18.715
and a repentant prodigal son, Jesus,

638
00:37:19.415 --> 00:37:22.955
the son of God, the king of kings is the merciful savior

639
00:37:23.415 --> 00:37:28.195
of the blind beggar, the savior of the thief on the cross,

640
00:37:28.325 --> 00:37:32.555
dying next to him of greedy Zacchaeus

641
00:37:33.135 --> 00:37:34.515
of demon tormented.

642
00:37:34.515 --> 00:37:39.155
Mary Magdalene. He's the Savior of John the Baptist,

643
00:37:39.555 --> 00:37:41.515
a strange wilderness dweller

644
00:37:41.975 --> 00:37:44.235
and the Lord of his mother, Elizabeth, an elderly,

645
00:37:44.935 --> 00:37:46.395
shamed, barren woman.

646
00:37:49.215 --> 00:37:53.755
And he's the savior of his own mother, Mary, a young, unwed,

647
00:37:53.755 --> 00:37:56.595
insignificant girl from lowly Nazareth

648
00:37:57.655 --> 00:37:59.675
of whom today we proclaim.

649
00:37:59.675 --> 00:38:01.515
Blessed are you among women

650
00:38:03.095 --> 00:38:04.795
and blessed is the fruit of your womb.

651
00:38:05.975 --> 00:38:10.475
And blessed is she who believed that what God would do all

652
00:38:10.545 --> 00:38:15.475
that he promised to do, she was truly blessed

653
00:38:15.575 --> 00:38:20.195
for in her womb, God himself had finally

654
00:38:20.745 --> 00:38:22.355
come to dwell with man.

655
00:38:25.255 --> 00:38:29.435
So let us too, as we recognize our own lowly

656
00:38:29.855 --> 00:38:31.115
and humble estate

657
00:38:31.215 --> 00:38:35.035
before our king, let's follow Mary's example.

658
00:38:36.735 --> 00:38:39.725
Let's rejoice in Jesus our Savior,

659
00:38:39.945 --> 00:38:44.285
and let's magnify him with every bit of our souls.

660
00:38:46.185 --> 00:38:48.325
To that end, let's pray this morning.

661
00:38:48.465 --> 00:38:52.525
God, if we, we magnify

662
00:38:53.195 --> 00:38:57.045
your name, Lord God, you are great

663
00:38:57.385 --> 00:38:59.325
and worthy of all of our praise.

664
00:38:59.505 --> 00:39:01.845
We rejoice in the salvation

665
00:39:01.945 --> 00:39:05.365
and we love the salvation that you've given to us.

666
00:39:06.435 --> 00:39:10.045
Poor lowly sinners who are deserving of nothing

667
00:39:10.945 --> 00:39:14.005
but your wrath, and yet you love us Anyway,

668
00:39:15.945 --> 00:39:18.525
remind us of how great you are

669
00:39:19.665 --> 00:39:22.165
and how desperately needy we are.

670
00:39:22.305 --> 00:39:24.445
For your grace in your love

671
00:39:24.985 --> 00:39:27.405
and our lives, we glorify you.

672
00:39:27.515 --> 00:39:30.165
King Jesus, magnify your name.

673
00:39:35.195 --> 00:39:37.255
One way that we get to magnify the Lord's.
