1
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.600
it

2
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.700
you

3
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.100
welcome again beloved to this Gathering of

4
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.400
Henderson Hills Baptist Church. My name is John and it's

5
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.900
great to see you as we continue in this Advent Series

6
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.400
this Christmas series that word

7
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400
Advent remember simply means coming or appearing.

8
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.600
And so this this is looking back to those faithful

9
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.300
Saints of olds who are awaiting for the Messiah to

10
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.200
come and they were looking ahead and waiting on his Advent his

11
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.500
appearing and so we we identify with them

12
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.600
yet in this season. We're also still awaiting something

13
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.400
ourselves.

14
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.400
That's Christ's second Advent at the end his second

15
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.900
appearing when all will be made, right?

16
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.400
And so these symbols and in these words that were studying in

17
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.100
this season are meant to create in us and

18
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100
anticipation.

19
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400
Both for what we celebrate in a couple weeks that incarnation of

20
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.000
of God In the Flesh Jesus coming

21
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.500
as a baby. We celebrate that

22
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
we're awaiting that but it also should point

23
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.000
us forward to that second coming.

24
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.800
When we will see all of of

25
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.600
the the things we're waiting for happen in

26
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.300
full form that's already in some part, but it's not

27
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.400
yet fully finished. And so we wait

28
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400
for that.

29
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.100
And that should lead us to live our lives differently

30
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.400
today.

31
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.500
And so to get there we have taken this

32
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.100
Advent series to look at five different words.

33
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.200
This is traditionally throughout the generations the same kind

34
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.100
of idea that these five words exemplify what

35
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.300
they were waiting for back then but also

36
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.000
what we're waiting for in full.

37
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.600
And each candle on this Reef will symbolize one of

38
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.300
those words represent one of those words.

39
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.000
And we light a new one each week as you'll see a little

40
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.300
bit later and we started this last Wednesday night where we

41
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.500
lighted the candle of hope that Jesus

42
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.800
fulfills the hope of every longing

43
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.000
heart both in part now, but in full in

44
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.300
the future, if you miss that one, you can go back on our website

45
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.400
on the app. You can go watch that one from Wednesday night to

46
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.600
catch up.

47
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.300
But today building off of that. Hope we will

48
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.800
look at how Jesus is the Peace of every

49
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.200
longing heart. So take your copy

50
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.800
of God's word and turn to the book of Ephesians to see that.

51
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.000
Ephesians chapter 2 in the New Testament Ephesians most

52
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.500
of the way through

53
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.600
Big Book of Romans

54
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.200
first second Corinthians Galatians Ephesians chapter

55
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.100
2 verses 11 through 22

56
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.800
Again, our word today is peace.

57
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.900
How Jesus is the Peace of every longing heart?

58
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.100
now one way to define a word is to lay out

59
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.400
a series of antonyms or words

60
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.400
that mean the exact opposite of what the word means

61
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.200
and so you can kind of get a feel for what it does mean and so what's

62
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.500
contrary to peace

63
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.300
Well, like Tolstoy said of course, it's War right

64
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.700
War and Peace, but but there's more to it.

65
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.500
The opposite of of peace is also division.

66
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.500
We're worried.

67
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.200
hate

68
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.800
chaos

69
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.900
stress

70
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.500
those are all opposites of peace. There's a lot of different meanings to

71
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.000
the word. Peace. So there's a lot of different antonyms to the same

72
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.600
word.

73
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.400
But at the essence of every definition of peace

74
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.000
Is the Old Testament Hebrew word shalom?

75
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.300
Shalom you might have heard of before.

76
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.300
It's a word that means complete.

77
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.600
were whole

78
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.200
think of a stone that has perfectly

79
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.300
whole shape with no cracks through

80
00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.500
it.

81
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.600
Or think of a brick wall that has no gaps.

82
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.700
And no missing bricks. It's complete.

83
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.800
The Bible project says the Shalom refers to something that's complex

84
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.700
with lots of pieces, but is

85
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.400
in a state of completeness or wholeness.

86
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.800
So imagine that 1,000 piece puzzle that

87
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.400
you and your family are going to work on over Christmas break, right?

88
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.600
You got whether that's like kittens or baby Yoda or

89
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.500
something, whatever you've got that you you dump that box

90
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.800
out and and you you know that that's that's in

91
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.400
chaos, right?

92
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.100
Just all the pieces strewn all over the place. But what do you

93
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.000
do you start to bring Shalom to the

94
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.600
puzzle?

95
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.800
Turn all the pieces over right side up so you can see the colors you separate

96
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.900
the edge pieces out you start to do the frame of

97
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.700
the puzzle. And then you start to match

98
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.600
the picture on the box with what you're doing

99
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.700
down here until it's complete.

100
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.700
shalom

101
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.600
kind of like that with our extremely complex lives, right?

102
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.200
Our Shalom breaks down when relationships

103
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.300
are out of alignment or

104
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.300
when situations are out of alignment or when things

105
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.500
are missing in our lives and things break down. It's

106
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.600
chaos. That is

107
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.800
out of peace

108
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.600
It's when you don't feel peaceful, right when all

109
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.200
these things are going on, and it's not as it should

110
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.300
be.

111
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.600
When life is no longer whole whenever it needs

112
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.200
to be restored in some way when you feel chaos.

113
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.000
It's a lack of peace.

114
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.000
And so what do you do you try to bring shalom?

115
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.600
To your life by I got to finish that project. I

116
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.200
need to repay that someone that I've I've heard or

117
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.900
there's a loss. I got to pay that back or or relationship that's

118
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.700
broken. I need to restore that so we

119
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.100
can flourish together. Like that's what you start to do.

120
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.800
You start to bring Shalom you go about trying to make things whole

121
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.100
again.

122
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.200
but the nonchaloam that Brokenness

123
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.400
is where we find ourselves here in Ephesians 2.

124
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.300
Now right before the section will study Paul had just described the

125
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.500
beauty of individual salvation by grace through faith

126
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.900
in Jesus.

127
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.700
But in verses 11 through 22 here, he applies that

128
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.100
same gospel to the whole body.

129
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.700
To how it shows up.

130
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.200
with a group

131
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.700
Here it is verses 11 through 22. Listen.

132
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.900
Therefore just because of the Gospel remember that at

133
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.600
one time you Gentiles in the flesh called

134
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.200
the uncircumcision by what is called the circumcision, which

135
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.300
is made in the flesh by hands. Remember that you

136
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.100
were at that time separated from Christ alienated from

137
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.300
the common wealth of Israel strangers to the covenants of

138
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.000
Promise having no hope without God in the

139
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.200
world.

140
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.300
But now in Christ Jesus you were once far off

141
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.100
have been brought near by the blood of Christ for he himself

142
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.700
is our peace.

143
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.600
Who has made us both one has broken down in his flesh the

144
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.500
dividing wall of hostility by abolishing the

145
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.700
law of Commandments expressed in ordinances.

146
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.200
That he might create in himself one new man in

147
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.900
place of the two so making peace.

148
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.300
And might reconcile us both to God in one body through the

149
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:38.700
cross.

150
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.100
thereby killing the hostility

151
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.200
and he came and preached peace to you who are far

152
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.100
off and peace to those who were near.

153
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.400
For through him we both have access in one

154
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.000
Spirit to the father.

155
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.500
So then you are no longer strangers and Aliens, but you are fellow citizens

156
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.800
with the Saints and members of the household of God.

157
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.900
Built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Christ.

158
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.800
Jesus himself being the Cornerstone.

159
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.400
In whom the whole structure being joined together grows

160
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.700
into a holy Temple in the Lord.

161
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.000
In him you also are being built together into a

162
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.500
dwelling place for God by the spirit.

163
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.000
God help us understand this help us see your peace

164
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.800
that shows up in daily life

165
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.300
as well.

166
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.800
And Jesus name help us.

167
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.000
amen

168
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.200
And so what was the problem here?

169
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.400
As we look at this passage in this early church in Ephesus. What

170
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.000
was the problem?

171
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.800
Well, the problem was that you had people from Jewish backgrounds

172
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.200
who were believing in Christ coming to Faith In Jesus.

173
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.800
And then you also had people who are from non-jewish backgrounds believing

174
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.500
in Jesus coming to faith in Christ.

175
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.400
Which meant that that these people over here who were

176
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.500
historically ostracized by the Jews who had

177
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.300
been kept to the fringes of society and kept

178
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.700
to the fringes of worship.

179
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.200
We're now in the church together.

180
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.500
These people are once enemies once opposing groups

181
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.600
were now together and that made that potentially explosive

182
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.600
because there was not peace traditionally

183
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.500
between these two groups.

184
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.100
There was tolerance but there was no peace true

185
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.200
Unity here. There was not shalom.

186
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.300
There was merely division.

187
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.700
There was division that happened in life.

188
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.000
division among people here

189
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.200
and you see it right the language used in verse

190
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.100
12. He says separated alienated strangers.

191
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.200
Even verse 14 explicitly talks about this

192
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.600
dividing wall of hostility.

193
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.300
It's like East and West Germany, right? Remember that there was a dividing wall that

194
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.400
kept people apart from each other. That's a

195
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.200
lack of Shalom, right?

196
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.400
Israel had cast them off and said that because they did not

197
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.000
have God's covenant by God's law then

198
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.000
they were excluded.

199
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.300
Which actually was not just a Jewish Problem from

200
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.600
before Jesus this actually dripped into the church this

201
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.400
same thought process showed up where there

202
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.800
was a debate early in the church whether Gentile Believers

203
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.300
had to become Jewish to be Christians.

204
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.200
It's the whole book of Galatians you go read how this debate happened that

205
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.200
they need to go through these rituals to become Christians like hold up.

206
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.700
It was just this division among people.

207
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.100
That was the problem. It was division in the

208
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.300
world.

209
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.600
But it was even division within the church that Paul's addressing

210
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.500
here in Ephesians 2.

211
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.400
Well thankfully 2,000 years of progress has

212
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.500
solved this problem, right?

213
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.000
No, there is sadly so

214
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.400
much more division now that seems than ever

215
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:06.500
before.

216
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.300
Course, we have wars between nations happening around the world. But

217
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.400
but even on such basic things

218
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.000
like like politics and sports were so divided.

219
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.500
I can't even tell you the things that I heard on the sidelines. I

220
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.000
don't know away game.

221
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.100
Like no literally I can't repeat it. It's so bad like I would be

222
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:29.800
terrible.

223
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.400
Like here in these things about my mom. I'm like

224
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.500
guys it's just a game like come on, man.

225
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.400
Some of you even saw it in your family's last week at Thanksgiving, right?

226
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.600
As soon as your uncle brought up the economy, man, everything goes south

227
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.800
and nobody has any more fun.

228
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.700
Division is not gone from churches either.

229
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.900
We're preaching style or music style or clothing

230
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.900
choices become reasons people split congregations.

231
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.400
Or were some churches will show disdain for those who

232
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.400
don't look like or dress like or

233
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.500
think like the majority.

234
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.100
And so it becomes a very homogeneous group.

235
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.100
Now hear me. I'm not talking about when leaders abuse Trust.

236
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.000
or when

237
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.600
or when we have first tier issues like theological concerns

238
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.300
over the atonement or the deity

239
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.200
of Christ not talking about those things that we must

240
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.500
stand firm on absolutely.

241
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.400
I'm talking about second or even third level

242
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.500
issues where it might be harder to

243
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.000
come together because of preferences and backgrounds, but

244
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.000
we're commanded to come together on.

245
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.700
Doesn't mean we're all going to agree preferences, and we're

246
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.000
not all unanimous.

247
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.000
But Unity is what we're commanded to have.

248
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.200
but the reason

249
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.700
they're still division in the world.

250
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.200
The reason they're still division among people outside the

251
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.600
church even inside the church is because our modern society

252
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.600
has not Advanced past the source

253
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.400
of that disunity.

254
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.000
Which is our Wicked hearts.

255
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.500
It's in here.

256
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.400
This is the foundation behind all the other

257
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.500
problems in the world.

258
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.500
James 4 makes it very clear.

259
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.300
Verses 1 through 4, what causes corals and what causes

260
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.100
fights among you is it not this that your

261
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.300
passions your desires are at War

262
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:51.900
within you?

263
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.900
You desire and you do not have and so you murder.

264
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.400
You covet and cannot obtain and so you fight and

265
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.200
quarrel.

266
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.400
You do not have because you do not ask you ask

267
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.200
and don't receive because you ask wrongly to spend on

268
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.100
your own Passions.

269
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.600
You adulterous people?

270
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.300
Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with

271
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:13.500
God?

272
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.400
Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself

273
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.400
an enemy of God.

274
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.900
selfish sin

275
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.600
is the reason there is war in the world. The reason

276
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.200
there's Strife in your family. The reason they're splits

277
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.300
in churches.

278
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.100
It's because of this inside of each one

279
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.500
of us.

280
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:40.900
And that's bad.

281
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.800
Carnage it hurts

282
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.400
But there's actually a deeper consequence here than any

283
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.100
of those other problems.

284
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.300
This those are bad but there's a deeper one. Not only do we have division among

285
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.600
people because of our sin James 4 even said now we

286
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.400
because of that have enmity with God.

287
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.200
Because of what's inside of us.

288
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.300
Because of our sin because of our selfishness brings enmity

289
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.700
with God.

290
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.800
And you saw it here in Ephesians 2 right over and

291
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.000
over this this separation from God because God

292
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.200
is Holy because God is separate. He's

293
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.100
different. He's other he's perfect and for

294
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.800
anyone to be with God we must be just like him.

295
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.500
We must be like him or we can't be with him.

296
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:30.900
Here's the problem though.

297
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.200
Beginning of Ephesians 2 verses 1 through 3 we read this.

298
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.300
You were dead in the trespasses and sins and what

299
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.400
you once walked following the course of this world which

300
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.400
James 4 said brings enmity with God, right?

301
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.200
Following the prince of the power of the air the spirit that is now

302
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.100
at work and the sons of Disobedience among whom we

303
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.500
all once lived in the passions of our flesh.

304
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.300
Carrying out the desires of the body and the mind

305
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.200
and were by Nature as a result of all of

306
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.000
that children of Wrath.

307
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.500
like the rest of mankind

308
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.700
meaning every one of us

309
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.900
and listen to be a child of Wrath means that

310
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.200
wrath is your inheritance.

311
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.600
It means that that wrath.

312
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.500
Towards sin is coming on you.

313
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.200
And your sin?

314
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.000
Because he's holy.

315
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.900
He must do something with sin.

316
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.400
And this is the problem for every one of us on our own.

317
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.000
And there's nothing we can do ourselves to to

318
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.600
fix the problem to overcome this issue to

319
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.400
gain access to God to bring peace to our

320
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.200
lives. We can't

321
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.400
but praise the Lord that he can.

322
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.200
Praise the Lord that he can because thankfully this

323
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.200
passage in Ephesians 2 not only describes the problem it also

324
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.600
explains the solution.

325
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.200
It gives us the solution to that

326
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.900
same problem of division among people of enmity

327
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.400
with God. It gives us the solution not just

328
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.000
a bad news. This is also the good news.

329
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.400
But notice here the solution had nothing to do

330
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.400
with human ingenuity.

331
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.500
And nothing to do with with our our education

332
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.700
improving or political situation improving. This

333
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.600
was a spiritual problem. So it needed a

334
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.300
spiritual solution.

335
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.300
And that's called the Messiah.

336
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.100
solution to this problem

337
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.700
that Ephesians 2 shows us

338
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.900
Is the messiah?

339
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.600
It is the Messiah the predicted one. They

340
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.400
were waiting for in the Old Testament. This this one

341
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.100
they were longing for.

342
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.100
The one we now know as Jesus.

343
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.100
This is the solution given the

344
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.300
solution to their problems and see what he

345
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.400
did. Right. Let's go back through see what he did to fix

346
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.600
their problems in Ephesians 2.

347
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.800
Verse 13 says he shed his blood to

348
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.600
bring near the Gentiles.

349
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.600
Instead of where they were before where they were kept outside the

350
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.100
temple.

351
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.200
Excluded now.

352
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.200
They had equal access to God's presence

353
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.300
Through jesus' Blood, not any

354
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.800
animal anymore or anything else that was all taken care of jesus' blood

355
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.400
brought Jews and Gentiles into the holy

356
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.000
place.

357
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200
to God's very presence

358
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.600
He brought near the Gentiles and

359
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.600
then in verse 14 through 16. Jesus broken body

360
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.700
destroyed that dividing wall

361
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.700
of hostility.

362
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.500
He made these formerly separated groups

363
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.600
now one body.

364
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.000
Through his broken body in other words. He was shredded so

365
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.000
that we could be healed.

366
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.900
He was torn into pieces so

367
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.600
that we could be unified we could be completed

368
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.900
we could be whole.

369
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.500
shalom

370
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.300
his broken body brought about

371
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.600
Shalom for us.

372
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.200
And the final thing he said it says here in Ephesians

373
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.000
2 that Jesus did to fix the problems.

374
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.500
He provided acts in one Spirit

375
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.300
to the father both, Jew and

376
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.500
Gentile access to very God himself.

377
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.500
through the spirit

378
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.300
through his broken body through his blood and all of

379
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:46.900
that is true.

380
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.300
He fixed all the problems all that is true because of what verse 14

381
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.100
says about Jesus.

382
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.000
It says that he himself is our

383
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
peace.

384
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.200
That's the Greek version of that same word. We've looked at in Hebrew Old

385
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.100
Testament Shalom. This is the the Greek version of that that he

386
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.600
himself this this Messiah Savior.

387
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.500
Jesus is our peace.

388
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.300
This is the same thing that Isaiah predicted.

389
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.600
About the Messiah that would come in the Messiah.

390
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.500
He looked at this 700 years before Jesus showed up

391
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.300
and he predicted this Isaiah 9 verses 6

392
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:27.700
and 7.

393
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.700
He says this.

394
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.800
for to us a child is born to

395
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.300
us a son is given and the government

396
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.100
shall be upon his shoulder his name Shall be Called

397
00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.100
wonderful counselor, Mighty God Everlasting father Prince

398
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.300
of

399
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.000
peace shalom

400
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.800
of the increase of his government and of

401
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.900
Peace there will be no end.

402
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.300
On the throne of David over his kingdom to establish it to uphold it

403
00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.800
with Justice with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore.

404
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.500
The Zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

405
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.800
He himself.

406
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.400
Prince of Peace is our peace. It's

407
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.200
what Jesus was was declared to be

408
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.900
even by the Angels who showed up the night. He was born they they

409
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.100
came to these dirty Shepherds out on the

410
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.200
fields and he says they they shout this glory to

411
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.700
God in the highest and on Earth. Peace.

412
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.300
Among those with whom he is pleased.

413
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.100
That's what Jesus himself said.

414
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.200
He was going to give his followers unlike anything the

415
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.600
world would offer John 14:27. Jesus says, peace

416
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.900
I leave with you.

417
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.100
my peace

418
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.200
not the world's peace. They can't do anything. Nothing can do this.

419
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.600
My peace. I give to you. Nothing else

420
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.400
hear me. Nothing else can give you the peace your

421
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:50.900
longing for.

422
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.700
even the situation you're worried about fixing working

423
00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.600
out all that you think it should be

424
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.700
Will not give you the peace that you long for.

425
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.400
It's only found in Jesus himself as

426
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.200
our peace.

427
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.400
But that peace he is that he brings all that.

428
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.000
It does something.

429
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.500
Here it does something in Ephesians chapter 2.

430
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.600
What are the results we see here?

431
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.100
From this Messiah being our peace. What are the

432
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.100
results that we see very clearly?

433
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.400
Well, here's the first result we see from Jesus being our peace.

434
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.500
The first result in Ephesians 2 is that we now have

435
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.000
and can have eternal peace with God.

436
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.700
So this Messiah coming that we're waiting for that

437
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.300
they were waiting for he brings peace with

438
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.600
God.

439
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.200
Sal Romans 5 describes it so well

440
00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.900
verses 1 and 2 say since we have been justified by

441
00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.600
faith. We have peace with God through our

442
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.400
Lord Jesus Christ.

443
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.800
Through him we have obtained access by faith

444
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.000
into this grace in which we stand and

445
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.200
we rejoice in Hope of the

446
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.800
glory of God.

447
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.300
See, this is what the Old Testament saints were longing for.

448
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.700
This is what they were waiting for is this full consistent

449
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.400
piece with and access to

450
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.200
God himself. That's what they wanted.

451
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.500
Because they didn't have it. They had to go to the temple they had to to wait. They

452
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.300
were they were longing for this. They didn't see it in full form around

453
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.000
them and they were waiting for this consistent piece.

454
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.300
They're waiting for this Messiah to come and bring that Shalom back.

455
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.300
That they once had back in the Garden of Eden

456
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.300
that they once had in the promised land in some form they were

457
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.600
waiting for peace again.

458
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.100
To restore the wholeness.

459
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.800
Of the broken relationships that they had between themselves each

460
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.100
other and their creator.

461
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.000
Unbeliever, this is the aching you feel deep down in your soul.

462
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.300
Is something's off.

463
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.900
And you can't find a way to fix it.

464
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.000
It's this.

465
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.800
peace with God

466
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.200
But did you see what Romans 5:1 said the only way we can get that

467
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:19.900
peace with God.

468
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.100
It says through being justified by faith.

469
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.000
It's a legal term. That means being set, right.

470
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.600
And it goes back to Ephesians 2. We're continuing on right

471
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.300
before what we just read Ephesians 2:8 and 9.

472
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.600
It says that by Grace you have been saved through

473
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.200
faith.

474
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.500
And this is not your own doing it is the gift of God

475
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.400
not a result of works so that no

476
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.500
one may both.

477
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.700
Now kids Christmas is coming up.

478
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.400
You don't earn your gifts, right?

479
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.400
At least parents. I hope not that's it. Let's have a conversation about that if

480
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.700
you if you are but kids right you don't earn your

481
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.000
gifts.

482
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.300
If you if you had to earn your gifts, they stop

483
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.300
being gifts. They become a wage. It becomes something you earn.

484
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:13.900
Or you lose?

485
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.000
No with a gift you simply receive a gift

486
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.400
you're trusting that The Giver of

487
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.300
that gift is good and they are giving you something good.

488
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.800
That's what you trust in receiving a gift.

489
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.100
But like some of you did I I grew up

490
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.700
in church my whole life.

491
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.300
Here's what here's what I fear happens for many of us in that

492
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:42.600
situation.

493
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.800
Here's what I worry. We believe wrongly about this

494
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.400
regarding salvation.

495
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.800
First I fear that we somehow wrongly believe

496
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.700
that we deserve that gift.

497
00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.200
of salvation

498
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.100
And we're not really that bad.

499
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.400
And sure God looked into the world and said

500
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.300
man, they're they're decent human being I should save them

501
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.300
get them on my team. Right like somehow we we think that that's

502
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.100
where we're better than the jerk down the street or jerk at

503
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.400
school like we we're okay we deserve this, right?

504
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.200
or maybe

505
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.300
we wrongly believe that.

506
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.400
Man, we better keep our nose clean so we can keep that

507
00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:30.800
gift.

508
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.400
And there's this fear creeping over your shoulder that

509
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.600
you're always about to lose that gift of selfish

510
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.300
that God's about to snatch it away from you because you just

511
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.200
did too much.

512
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.200
You went too far this time.

513
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.100
But I can't do you see here.

514
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.400
God's heart in Ephesians 2 that his

515
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.200
desire

516
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.900
his heart is to bring us near to

517
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.300
himself.

518
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.500
That he he wants those who were without hope in

519
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.300
the world those who are without God in the world. He says

520
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.700
come near to me.

521
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.000
Let me let me reconcile you. Let me

522
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.200
give you access to God. Let me adopt you into my

523
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.900
family. Let me dwell inside of you. What Grace here.

524
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.500
This is the kind of peace with God.

525
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.000
Through the Messiah that those Old Testament saints were

526
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:32.600
longing for.

527
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.500
It's what we all need.

528
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.300
To know that confidently not to not to walk

529
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.400
around and prideful arrogance not to walk around in fear.

530
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.000
It's to walk around in confident humble. Peace

531
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.400
with God through Jesus in our

532
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:49.500
place.

533
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.600
It's what we all need but it's also hear me.

534
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.300
It's also what we are we're hopeful and

535
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.300
anticipating and longing for in the future that will come one

536
00:28:59.300 --> 00:28:59.900
day in full.

537
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.900
Because again, we're not living in full. Peace yet. Are we?

538
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.200
There's still Brokenness. There's still chaos. There's still things

539
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.400
that we we choose to do that that sort of lead us away

540
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.800
from that peace with God that we feel daily, but

541
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.700
what we're longing for

542
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.500
What we're longing for church is what what is coming someday where

543
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.000
everything that threatens that shalom in

544
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.900
our lives will one day be removed.

545
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.000
All the external and internal forces that threaten shalom

546
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.500
in our lives will one day be removed. It's what

547
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.900
Revelation 21 three through five describes where he

548
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.400
looks into heaven and he says Behold The

549
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.600
Dwelling Place of God is with man.

550
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.200
Perfect. Peace with God face to face

551
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.300
with our creator he will dwell with them. They will

552
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.500
be his people God himself will be with them as their God.

553
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.900
He'll wipe away every tear from their eyes Death

554
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.100
Shall be no more neither shall there be

555
00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.200
mourning nor crying nor pain anymore for the former things

556
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.900
have passed away.

557
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.000
And he who is Seated on the throne said behold? I

558
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.500
am making all things new unbelievers

559
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.500
don't you want that too?

560
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.600
Like we all as Believers long for that day. We know that's

561
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.800
coming and we we have a hope for that day, but unbeliever

562
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.900
don't you want that to

563
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.100
There's a hope in you. There's a aching in you for

564
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:24.900
that same thing.

565
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.400
It's only found in Jesus.

566
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:30.900
He himself.

567
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.800
is our peace

568
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.500
peace with God is essential both now

569
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.500
and forever.

570
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.800
But there's actually one other result in Ephesians 2 of this Advent.

571
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.800
this Messiah

572
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:50.800
it's this.

573
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.700
Unity among people

574
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.000
So what was once division?

575
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:01.500
Among people now in the Messiah there

576
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.100
can be Unity.

577
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.600
It can be Unity among people in Jesus.

578
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.300
Like when you go back and read Ephesians 2:11 through 22 and you

579
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.200
think through what what the Apostle Paul was writing here.

580
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.800
It seems like he goes out of his way to describe

581
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.500
the feeling the Gentiles must have felt

582
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.700
as they were excluded from the Jewish traditions.

583
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:31.000
These words that describe the separation for so

584
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.000
long. But what that does is it only magnifies the

585
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.700
gracious Unity that Jesus himself brings

586
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.900
in light of that.

587
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.500
I mean just look back through this verse 13 He says they who

588
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.800
are once far off have now been brought near.

589
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.400
Verse 14. He made them both one new man.

590
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.300
In verse 15 abolished broke down the wall

591
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.300
of the ceremonial law that used to divide them. He

592
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.200
says what was once divided now, you're back verse 16.

593
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.300
He reconciled them together in one body through

594
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.100
the cross Verse 18, they both have access to the

595
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.700
father through Jesus in the spirit.

596
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.100
verse 19 no longer foreigners now fellow citizens

597
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.100
leading to verses 20 to 22. Which describe how God is

598
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.800
making his church his new Dwelling Place.

599
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.800
Where all these pieces that were once chaos and Scattered are

600
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.200
now joined together perfectly.

601
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.200
And his his word his his Christ is

602
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.800
the foundation.

603
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.500
And it brings Shalom right like that puzzle. Chaos now

604
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.300
pictured perfect. It's shalom.

605
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.400
See this whole Passage.

606
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.800
It paints a beautiful Colossians 3:11

607
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.600
you go read that later Colossians 3:11 picture of

608
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.000
unity in the church this restored.

609
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.400
Grace of unity

610
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.000
through jesus' life death and Resurrection

611
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.200
Which also means that Jews and Gentiles and what he's

612
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.200
talking about Ephesus that was happening the unity was happening. It was hard but

613
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.600
it was happening which means that that kind of unity is

614
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.700
something that we can experience today as well.

615
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.800
If it's through Jesus if it's through the gospel.

616
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.500
Through the spirit. We have the ability for the

617
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.600
same kind of unity today even.

618
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.400
Even in the many nationalities represented Among Us

619
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.400
in this church.

620
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.700
Even as those from diverse backgrounds who

621
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.300
didn't grow up in church like me didn't grow up in a

622
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.600
safe family like you like even from diverse

623
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.400
backgrounds who who understand the gospel plug

624
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.300
in here even among that. There's Unity even

625
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.100
as we share peace with the downcast and the outcast out there

626
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.300
even as we go and and see God bring more

627
00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.200
people because the gospel still the same

628
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.700
as it was in Ephesus, then we can have Unity no

629
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:03.900
matter what

630
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.600
No matter what. We're facing no matter what differences we

631
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.200
have. It's just going to take some Hig puff to

632
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:11.600
maintain it.

633
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.500
I know some of you're like, what did he just say? What what

634
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.000
is that?

635
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.300
Let me describe. It's been a couple years of this journey for

636
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.300
us as a church, but higpuff is an acronym we use to show

637
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.300
what we do to maintain Unity higpuff humility

638
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.800
gentleness patience forbearance.

639
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.400
That's what it is humility generals patience and forbearance,

640
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.000
and it comes from Ephesians chapter 4.

641
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.400
Just a page to the right. Maybe it's what we find in verses

642
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.200
1 through 3 and you'll hear it here.

643
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.300
That in light of the Gospel again. Paul says

644
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.800
I a prisoner of the Lord.

645
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.200
Urge you to walk in a manner worthy of

646
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.800
the calling to which you've been called with all humility and

647
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.700
gentleness with patience bearing with

648
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.700
one another in love or forbearance.

649
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.500
Eager to maintain the unity

650
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.700
of the spirit in the bond of peace.

651
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.000
There's that word again. Peace.

652
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.300
There's the that's the the glue that holds us

653
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.600
together. Right? It's peace in Jesus.

654
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.500
He himself is our peace, but now it's up

655
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.100
to us.

656
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.500
The spirit's already given us Unity. It says he's

657
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.300
he's welding us together like two

658
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.100
metals.

659
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.900
It's up to us to maintain that Unity is what it says.

660
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.900
eagerly maintaining it through higpuff

661
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.500
Now again, like I said before it doesn't mean we're going to agree on every

662
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.200
preference doesn't mean we're ever Oregon's gonna

663
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.600
agree on every way. We should do certain things in here

664
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.400
or in the world. It just means we don't fight

665
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.000
each other we fight for Unity.

666
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.600
We fight for Unity in the midst of the diversity.

667
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.400
And think about how these four qualities higpuff help

668
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.800
maintain unity in the church. Just hear

669
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.700
these humility.

670
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.100
What that means is that I'm putting you ahead of

671
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:12.600
myself.

672
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.200
What if you walked in here what if every one of us walked in

673
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.900
here on a Sunday and thought about more what everybody

674
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.600
else likes?

675
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.200
or enjoys

676
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.100
what if as we think about gentleness?

677
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.300
Which means that I'm not going to fly off the handle when I disagree with

678
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:33.500
you.

679
00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.300
When I don't get in my way, what if what if

680
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.300
we were always calm in our responses towards one another?

681
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:41.900
in the church

682
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.700
or even online

683
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.100
and gentleness

684
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.500
flowing out of us

685
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.600
patience

686
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.700
patience means I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.

687
00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.300
And give you time and space to grow.

688
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.400
And so what if we walked around in our lives assuming the

689
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.300
best of others?

690
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.500
the best intentions the best motivations

691
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.000
Now I get trust to understand that there's a level of

692
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.400
that that we need to continue to build. But what if we just assumed the

693
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:17.400
best?

694
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.400
And we're patient.

695
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.300
And the f is forbearance which in the

696
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.100
text is bearing with one other in love. That means I'm going

697
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.600
to forgive you when you blow it because I

698
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.000
love you.

699
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.400
And I'm trusting God to change you.

700
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.700
Not me.

701
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.400
God to change you.

702
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.400
I'm bearing with you in love.

703
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.200
Because I know God's working.

704
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.600
Think about each one of us having that

705
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.200
higpuff attitude.

706
00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.000
Would that not Foster Unity within the church?

707
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.800
Absolutely. What?

708
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.400
But again, we can only do that.

709
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.600
We can only do that if we have peace with God ourselves.

710
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.200
Individually each one of us having peace with God if we have been

711
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.700
put back together in shalom.

712
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.300
If the chaos of Our Lives has

713
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.100
been restored in Jesus.

714
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.700
Now, I know I say that perfect. Peace is still future.

715
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.000
There will still be disagreements there will still be tiffs. There will

716
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.700
still be issues. There will still be things that happen in the world. But the beauty of

717
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.400
this Messiah is that he now brings

718
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.600
a foretaste of that Glory Divine in

719
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.300
our lives even today.

720
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.300
So we have glimpses and feelings of

721
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.500
Hope and peace and joy and love

722
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.600
showing up because of Jesus even today.

723
00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:58.700
but one day

724
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.800
in full we long for that day.

725
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.100
And so so you might be sitting here today.

726
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.400
In your life is chaos.

727
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.600
And you've tried everything to try to fix it.

728
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.600
And you know you don't have peace with God right now.

729
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.600
You know, this is not describing you. What

730
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.200
do you do with that you turn from your sin and yourself and

731
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.600
you turn to Jesus in your place?

732
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.600
You receive this gift of Salvation at

733
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:30.900
Christmas.

734
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:32.900
What better gift?

735
00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.400
That's that's if you feel that right now you

736
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.600
turn to the one who he himself is your peace

737
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.400
you turn to him. But then once you have that.

738
00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.900
And for those of us who do believe.

739
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.700
We are now called to live out that Shalom

740
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.700
here on Earth.

741
00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.100
To be what Jesus said in Matthew 5 to be peacemakers.

742
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.000
Shalom makers

743
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.300
now again, the only way we can do that is in his

744
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.500
power alone him doing that through us as we abide

745
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.100
in him. But but this this peacemaking, this

746
00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.300
is how the world around us gets a taste

747
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:19.900
of Eternity.

748
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.300
That's how they just they they start to see Shalom happen

749
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.200
because because the world isn't showing that how do they see

750
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.100
it? They see it in us and through us.

751
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.600
Where Jesus being our peace?

752
00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.200
Means we bring a wholeness to those who

753
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.400
are entrapped in poverty. For example.

754
00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.600
And we show the world a diverse Church

755
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.300
unified around the gospel. They're like,

756
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.500
wow. I've never seen that before or you start to humble

757
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.300
yourself and you confront somebody over a sin,

758
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.800
but then you end up with a deeper relationship when they

759
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.900
walk in Repentance.

760
00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.800
That's Shalom. That's that's wholeness coming

761
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.300
to the world.

762
00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.300
When a man's broken over his addiction and he comes to you and you

763
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.500
you lead him to Jesus and he walks in

764
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.500
Humble repentance and you walk with him towards

765
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.000
wholeness in his life his family.

766
00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.300
And on and on we could go of how the world sees peace

767
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.900
through us as we bring Shalom

768
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.600
to those around us. That's what happens as

769
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.700
people as people see the glory of God shine through

770
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.500
us. They see

771
00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.500
shalom

772
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.700
they begin to long for that same peace

773
00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.800
in their lives.

774
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.200
They longed to know the one.

775
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.400
As Ephesians 2:14 said they long to know the one who he

776
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.100
himself is our peace.

777
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.900
So let's wait on him for that and let's be that kind of people.

778
00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.700
In light of his peace for us and that candle

779
00:41:59.700 --> 00:41:59.800
today.

780
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.900
That candle of peace is what we're going to light this morning.

781
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.800
To remind us of how Jesus came to

782
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.800
bring peace and Jesus is our peace. We

783
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.000
lighted the candle of Hope on Wednesday night. And

784
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.800
today we'll add peace to it as the

785
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.300
second candle and invite the Adele family

786
00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.400
up here today to lead us through that.

787
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.200
Josh is one of our deacons they co-lead a

788
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.200
community group both Josh and Jenny serve Faithfully

789
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.400
in many ways in our kids ministry.

790
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.200
And their family again is going to light the Hope candle and

791
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.600
then the peace candle as well and read

792
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.200
some scripture that points us to

793
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:42.800
the Messiah.

794
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.500
That brings us peace that Messiah who

795
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.100
is our peace. We will see it in.

796
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.500
scripture today

797
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.200
How beautiful upon the mountains are the

798
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.900
feet of him who brings good news who publishes peace

799
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.200
who brings good news of Happiness who publishes

800
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.000
salvation? He says to Zion your

801
00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.600
god reigns the voice of your Watchman. They

802
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.900
lift up their voice together. They sing for Joy for

803
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.800
I to eye the return of the Lord to

804
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.400
Zion Break Forth together and singing

805
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.300
you waste places of Jerusalem for the Lord

806
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.700
has confronted his people.

807
00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.300
He has redeemed Jerusalem. The Lord has

808
00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.400
bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the

809
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.400
nations and all the ends of the Earth. Shall see the salvation

810
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.100
of our God.

811
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.200
Praise be to God.

812
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:08.700

Thank you for your blessing of peace.

815
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.700
Thank you for being our foundation.

816
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.900

817
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:21.700
times of pain

818
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.500
Thank you that through Jesus we have access to

819
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.500
your peace which passes all understanding.

820
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.800
Lift up this congregation and our leadership.

821
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.400
Ask for you to guard our hearts and our minds

822
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.500
in Christ Jesus.

823
00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.800
Pray for peace and unity among us so

824
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.300
we can better glorify you.

amen
