1
00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:01.225
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:04.105
Welcome to this gathering of Henderson Hills.

3
00:00:04.205 --> 00:00:05.745
My name's John, one of the pastors here.

4
00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:08.745
If you're new to our church, we would love to meet you.

5
00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:10.305
There's a new here area out in the lobby.

6
00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:13.265
Just go say hello and uh, let us know you're here.

7
00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:14.705
We'd love to let you know a little bit about us.

8
00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:17.785
Uh, if you call Henderson Hills home too, it is great

9
00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:18.945
to see you.

10
00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:20.905
We love you being here as well.

11
00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:24.425
So today, uh, is something

12
00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.825
that we call typically good, uh, Palm Sunday.

13
00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:29.345
Wow. I got ahead of myself a little bit there.

14
00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:33.705
Palm Sunday, which looks back

15
00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:36.585
to Jesus' final entrance into Jerusalem

16
00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:40.665
before he was eventually crucified a few days later on

17
00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:41.945
what we call Good Friday.

18
00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:47.305
Uh, and so that means, of course what that uh, looks forward

19
00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:51.145
to is Easter Sunday next week, resurrection day,

20
00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.985
where we will see that, uh, we gather together

21
00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:58.985
and we need to add a service for the space issues

22
00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:00.345
that we typically run into on Easter.

23
00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:02.145
And so there are different times next Sunday.

24
00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.305
Just remember that 8, 9 30, 11,

25
00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:07.345
if you can consider attending the eight

26
00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:08.545
or the 11 that would help us

27
00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:10.505
with serving our guests that day.

28
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.945
Uh, just so you know. But that's coming up this next week.

29
00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:17.265
And so thankful for this week to remind us, refocus us.

30
00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:20.745
I'm excited about it As we get into Palm Sunday today

31
00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:23.705
though, uh, let's start with some audience participation.

32
00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:27.225
Raise your hand if your life is perfect.

33
00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:32.945
Okay, good. Nobody. Alright, that's good to know.

34
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:36.145
Um, no, nobody did. Right. My hand's not up.

35
00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:37.545
Your hand isn't up. Of course.

36
00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:40.905
And we know that's kinda a silly question. Yet.

37
00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:43.345
Here's what I know many are struggling with.

38
00:01:45.815 --> 00:01:49.075
You think at least you're tempted to think

39
00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:52.595
everyone's life is perfect except yours.

40
00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:56.065
And so you feel like there's something wrong with you.

41
00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:00.155
And listen, Instagram doesn't help us with this, right?

42
00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:02.635
You have this, this filtered version of life

43
00:02:02.635 --> 00:02:05.195
that you put on there when the reality is something very

44
00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:07.875
much different than what is often seen there.

45
00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:10.435
But, but that's the projection is that life is perfect

46
00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:11.675
for everybody else except for me.

47
00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:13.555
But it's just not true, right?

48
00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:17.485
So let's try it a little bit differently.

49
00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:21.045
Raise your hand if there is something about your life

50
00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:23.125
that you would like to be different.

51
00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:27.405
Yes. Every one. Every one of us, right?

52
00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:30.085
Like that's the truth. And we all have something in our

53
00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:32.485
lives that we would like to change.

54
00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:33.965
Some are struggling financially

55
00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:35.885
and you're just trying to make ends meet.

56
00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:37.925
Or you've got a health issue nobody can figure out.

57
00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:39.325
Or your kids are rebelling

58
00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.325
and you don't know how to handle that with your grandkids

59
00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:43.165
and all those issues there.

60
00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:45.565
Or maybe you're, they're getting bullied at school

61
00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:48.365
or you have a dead end job

62
00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:51.325
or something in the world is crisis

63
00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:54.885
and you just feel like that's heavy on your soul right now.

64
00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:58.885
Everyone has something we'd like different.

65
00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:02.885
Now here's the thing we do with that is that we all then try

66
00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:06.005
to seek solutions to those problems.

67
00:03:08.185 --> 00:03:12.205
We all look for answers, solutions that will never satisfy.

68
00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:14.005
And we do it because we want that button

69
00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:15.325
that fixes everything.

70
00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:16.525
We want deliverance, right?

71
00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:20.885
We want that easy fix it button to make it all go away.

72
00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:25.795
Listen, we're not the first ones to feel that.

73
00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:30.115
We're not the first ones to look around at our world

74
00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:32.115
and hope something would be different.

75
00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:36.035
Look for deliverance, want and cry out for salvation.

76
00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:41.745
We're not the first, but what's the real answer

77
00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:43.825
if what we've tried over

78
00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:45.265
and over again is not getting us there?

79
00:03:45.285 --> 00:03:47.505
What's the real answer? Well, let me show you.

80
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:50.505
Take your copy of God's Word and turn with me to the gospel.

81
00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:51.305
According to

82
00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:55.845
Matthew, it's in the New Testament.

83
00:03:55.845 --> 00:03:57.845
It's about two thirds of the way through.

84
00:03:57.845 --> 00:04:00.485
You'll find the New Testament. Matthew is the first book.

85
00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:03.405
The gospel according to Matthew, be in chapter 21,

86
00:04:03.985 --> 00:04:05.125
big number 21 there.

87
00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:10.645
And this is where Jesus entered Jerusalem couple days

88
00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:12.205
before he ended up being crucified.

89
00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:14.685
This is what we call the triumphal entry

90
00:04:14.685 --> 00:04:18.565
or the palm Sunday, Matthew 21.

91
00:04:19.465 --> 00:04:21.245
I'm gonna look at verses one through 17.

92
00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.845
I'll read all of it, then we'll come back and look at it.

93
00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:29.405
Now, when they drew near to Jerusalem, came to Beth Page

94
00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:32.525
to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, sang

95
00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.165
to them, go into the village in front

96
00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:36.685
of you immediately you'll find a donkey tide

97
00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:37.805
and a cult with her.

98
00:04:38.455 --> 00:04:40.045
Untie them and bring them to me.

99
00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:41.805
If anyone says anything to you,

100
00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:43.845
you shall say the Lord needs them

101
00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:45.445
and he will send them at once.

102
00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:48.525
This took place to fulfill what the prophet spoken

103
00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:51.405
by the prophet saying, say to the daughter of Zion.

104
00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:54.245
Behold, your king is coming to you humble

105
00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:56.525
and mounted on a donkey, on a cult,

106
00:04:56.585 --> 00:04:57.885
the full of a beast of burden.

107
00:04:59.205 --> 00:05:01.345
So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them,

108
00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:02.345
and they brought the donkey

109
00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:04.345
and the cult put them, put on them their

110
00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:05.505
cloaks, and he sat on them.

111
00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.185
And most of the crowds spread their cloaks on the road.

112
00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:10.185
And others cut branches from the trees

113
00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:11.305
and spread them on the road.

114
00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.745
And the crowds that went before him

115
00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:15.185
and that followed him were shouting

116
00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:17.385
Hosanna to the son of David.

117
00:05:18.295 --> 00:05:20.505
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,

118
00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:22.265
Hosanna in the highest.

119
00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:25.005
And when he entered Jerusalem,

120
00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:27.685
this whole city was stirred up saying, who is this?

121
00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:30.525
And the crowd said, this is the prophet Jesus

122
00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:32.085
from Nazarus of Galilee.

123
00:05:33.535 --> 00:05:36.715
And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold

124
00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:37.715
and bought in the temple.

125
00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:40.555
And he overturned the tables of the money changers

126
00:05:40.555 --> 00:05:42.315
and the seats of those who sold pigeons.

127
00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:44.035
And he said to them, it is written,

128
00:05:44.575 --> 00:05:46.395
my house shall be called a house of prayer.

129
00:05:46.695 --> 00:05:50.615
But you make it a dent of robbers And a blind.

130
00:05:50.615 --> 00:05:53.095
And the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them.

131
00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:54.895
But when the chief priest

132
00:05:54.895 --> 00:05:57.200
and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, did,

133
00:05:57.265 --> 00:05:59.765
and the children crying out in the temple, hosanna

134
00:05:59.765 --> 00:06:01.845
to the son of David, they were indignant.

135
00:06:02.705 --> 00:06:04.885
And they said to him, do you hear what these are saying?

136
00:06:06.025 --> 00:06:07.405
And Jesus said to them, yes.

137
00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:09.205
Have you never read outta the mouth

138
00:06:09.205 --> 00:06:10.365
of infants and nursing babies?

139
00:06:10.465 --> 00:06:13.885
You have prepared praise and leaving them.

140
00:06:13.885 --> 00:06:17.525
He went out to the city, to Bethany and lodged there.

141
00:06:19.435 --> 00:06:20.485
Lord, this is your word.

142
00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:24.365
And clearly I need to get outta the way of this.

143
00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:28.445
And so I trust you are gonna work and speak in spite of me.

144
00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:31.725
I pray that you'll give, uh, clarity.

145
00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:35.865
You'll speak through your word and your way

146
00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:39.025
and your time to our hearts, that we'd be open in good soil

147
00:06:39.445 --> 00:06:42.745
to receive it and that you would bear good fruit.

148
00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:48.025
30, 60, a hundred fold for your glory for others, good

149
00:06:48.025 --> 00:06:51.025
for our good through obedience

150
00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:53.065
to your text that you've given us.

151
00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:56.905
Thank you Lord in Jesus' name. Amen.

152
00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:00.905
Now before we get too far into this,

153
00:07:00.905 --> 00:07:01.905
there's a couple phrases

154
00:07:01.905 --> 00:07:04.145
or words we saw in this that we need to define.

155
00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:06.265
Help us understand what's even going on here.

156
00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:08.385
And they were repeated a number of times in the passage.

157
00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:11.385
And so first you saw the word hosanna.

158
00:07:11.485 --> 00:07:13.745
People were shouting this, the kids were shouting this

159
00:07:14.415 --> 00:07:16.505
hosanna, what does that word even mean?

160
00:07:16.855 --> 00:07:19.505
Well, it's a combination of two Hebrew words

161
00:07:19.775 --> 00:07:21.105
that they mash together.

162
00:07:21.245 --> 00:07:23.705
And it basically just means save.

163
00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:28.125
We pray, save us. We pray.

164
00:07:30.745 --> 00:07:33.565
It was actually pretty common back in Jewish history.

165
00:07:35.035 --> 00:07:38.365
It's used a number of times in the Psalms, especially

166
00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.965
around the feast of the Tabernacles

167
00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:44.205
that they would celebrate every year back in Israel.

168
00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:45.965
And, and this was around that.

169
00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:47.805
And there was this remembrance, there was,

170
00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:49.285
shout the word hosanna.

171
00:07:49.505 --> 00:07:52.925
Let me give an example. Psalm one 18 verse 25,

172
00:07:53.195 --> 00:07:54.325
save us, we pray.

173
00:07:54.465 --> 00:07:58.045
Oh Lord, oh Lord, give us success. We pray. Right?

174
00:07:58.045 --> 00:08:00.685
They're, they're crying out both in a

175
00:08:00.755 --> 00:08:02.285
looking back kind of way.

176
00:08:02.785 --> 00:08:05.885
God thank you for saving us your uh, uh, exodus,

177
00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:08.165
deliverance, all of that you thank you for saving us.

178
00:08:08.785 --> 00:08:11.365
And it's also kinda looking forward that God,

179
00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:12.965
we know we're gonna need a salvation again.

180
00:08:13.145 --> 00:08:17.405
So save us, we pray it's back and forward.

181
00:08:20.045 --> 00:08:21.505
So that's the way they were using it here

182
00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:22.745
in Matthew 21, right?

183
00:08:23.455 --> 00:08:26.905
Like there's this, this rejoicing over God's deliverance

184
00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:28.505
and that he will, again,

185
00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:30.945
there's a rejoicing here in Matthew 21.

186
00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:34.065
They're praying for assistance from God

187
00:08:35.735 --> 00:08:36.955
and they're attributing that

188
00:08:36.955 --> 00:08:39.075
to God's anointed one, his Messiah.

189
00:08:39.215 --> 00:08:43.355
In fact, here they see Jesus as that seeing him

190
00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:45.675
as the savior that they were longing for.

191
00:08:47.285 --> 00:08:49.305
And we know that's true, that that's what they were seeing

192
00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:50.585
because of the way they say it.

193
00:08:51.055 --> 00:08:54.585
Hosanna not just hosanna by itself, Hosanna to the son

194
00:08:54.585 --> 00:08:56.585
of David, right?

195
00:08:56.585 --> 00:09:00.065
So there's a added piece that they add on Hosanna

196
00:09:00.065 --> 00:09:01.625
to the son of David.

197
00:09:01.655 --> 00:09:05.595
Well what does that mean? Again,

198
00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:09.715
that was a common term used for back then for the Messiah.

199
00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:13.995
They took the Old Testament and the prophecies

200
00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:15.075
and they mashed it all together.

201
00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:19.635
And it came out with Messiah son of David,

202
00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:21.555
that that was their term.

203
00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:25.635
They knew from the promises given to David.

204
00:09:25.645 --> 00:09:28.515
We'll look at it in a second. That Israel's greatest king,

205
00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:32.275
they knew that God had promised David that from his lineage

206
00:09:32.975 --> 00:09:34.195
the Messiah would come.

207
00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:38.305
How do we know that's true? Well second Samuel,

208
00:09:38.395 --> 00:09:39.945
we'll study second Samuel this fall.

209
00:09:40.685 --> 00:09:43.785
It says this. This is what God says to David,

210
00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.425
the greatest king Israel ever had.

211
00:09:46.525 --> 00:09:48.065
He said, wait, there's something better coming.

212
00:09:48.315 --> 00:09:51.065
Verse 12, when your days David are fulfilled

213
00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:53.385
and you lie down with your fathers, meaning you die,

214
00:09:54.545 --> 00:09:57.185
I God will raise up your offspring

215
00:09:57.185 --> 00:10:00.025
after you who shall come from your body, your family.

216
00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:02.505
And I will establish his kingdom.

217
00:10:04.025 --> 00:10:05.685
He shall build a house for my name.

218
00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:08.485
I will establish the throne of his kingdom.

219
00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:13.215
For I will be to him a father.

220
00:10:14.035 --> 00:10:17.135
He shall be to me a son when he commits iniquity.

221
00:10:17.135 --> 00:10:18.615
I will discipline with the rod of men,

222
00:10:18.925 --> 00:10:20.455
with the stripes of the sons of men.

223
00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:22.935
But my steadfast love will not depart from him

224
00:10:23.275 --> 00:10:25.935
as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from

225
00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:27.735
before you and your house.

226
00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:31.895
And your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.

227
00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:34.975
Your throne shall be established forever.

228
00:10:37.935 --> 00:10:41.395
And so those people in Jerusalem who were shouting

229
00:10:42.505 --> 00:10:47.195
Jesus's glory hosanna to the son of David, they knew

230
00:10:47.425 --> 00:10:49.955
that none of David's lineage had actually

231
00:10:50.235 --> 00:10:51.275
fulfilled that promise.

232
00:10:51.455 --> 00:10:56.065
Yet that Romans were in town like they were not

233
00:10:56.305 --> 00:10:58.665
reigning forever as is like there was something going on

234
00:10:58.665 --> 00:11:03.145
that wasn't fulfilled yet of this promise through David.

235
00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:04.505
And so they were longing for that.

236
00:11:04.505 --> 00:11:06.265
They were looking, waiting for

237
00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:10.545
anticipating this forever king to deliver them.

238
00:11:14.195 --> 00:11:16.255
And so these crowds, as they heard about Jesus,

239
00:11:17.315 --> 00:11:20.335
as they watched him with his compassion, his miracles,

240
00:11:20.335 --> 00:11:22.695
they sure felt like this one's the one

241
00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:25.015
the way Jesus spoke to their leaders.

242
00:11:25.075 --> 00:11:26.655
It was like this guy, he's coming

243
00:11:26.725 --> 00:11:27.935
into blow the whole thing up.

244
00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:28.975
This is the one on.

245
00:11:32.195 --> 00:11:33.535
Except there was a massive problem.

246
00:11:36.415 --> 00:11:39.425
They were actually looking for the wrong kind of savior.

247
00:11:40.775 --> 00:11:42.585
They weren't wrong in looking for the Savior.

248
00:11:42.815 --> 00:11:45.385
They were looking for the wrong kind of savior.

249
00:11:45.695 --> 00:11:49.585
Most of those people, their primary focus was ridding

250
00:11:50.185 --> 00:11:52.025
Israel's land of the hated Romans.

251
00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:56.645
Those people who were corrupting God's promises

252
00:11:56.645 --> 00:11:58.645
to his people, they were interpret,

253
00:11:58.645 --> 00:12:00.005
they were invading the land.

254
00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:03.365
He's like, get rid of 'em. That's our focus.

255
00:12:06.265 --> 00:12:09.765
Yet what they missed was that God had a much bigger plan

256
00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:11.605
than merely their comfort

257
00:12:11.745 --> 00:12:14.885
and their prosperity in those borders of their nation.

258
00:12:16.415 --> 00:12:19.115
God had something way bigger in mind.

259
00:12:19.145 --> 00:12:22.635
They were looking past what God said eternal blessings were

260
00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:26.035
and the the deep need they had for spiritual salvation,

261
00:12:26.035 --> 00:12:27.195
they were looking past all that

262
00:12:27.335 --> 00:12:29.555
to see they needed a political savior.

263
00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:34.165
That's why many

264
00:12:34.185 --> 00:12:38.605
of these same people ended up just a few days later calling

265
00:12:38.785 --> 00:12:40.165
for his crucifixion.

266
00:12:42.085 --> 00:12:43.655
Hosanna, save us. You're the one

267
00:12:44.525 --> 00:12:45.525
Crucify.

268
00:12:45.995 --> 00:12:49.125
Because they didn't get what they were wanting from him.

269
00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:57.065
Now I did this this week, I, I was looking at that

270
00:12:57.085 --> 00:12:59.225
and I'm sitting here thinking like how guys,

271
00:12:59.285 --> 00:13:00.385
how could you have missed it?

272
00:13:01.995 --> 00:13:03.345
Jesus was doing all these things.

273
00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:04.185
He was saying all these things.

274
00:13:04.245 --> 00:13:05.225
How could you have missed it?

275
00:13:05.325 --> 00:13:07.145
It seems so obvious to us

276
00:13:10.455 --> 00:13:11.795
yet let's give 'em a little grace here.

277
00:13:11.985 --> 00:13:16.915
Okay? Like these people, their desire for

278
00:13:16.915 --> 00:13:21.195
what they were desiring, that same desire is in every one

279
00:13:21.195 --> 00:13:22.355
of us too, isn't it?

280
00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:27.045
Like we're looking for a deliver, we're looking

281
00:13:27.105 --> 00:13:28.325
for a savior, aren't we?

282
00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:32.785
But are you looking for the wrong kind of savior?

283
00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:37.855
Am I looking for a savior

284
00:13:38.195 --> 00:13:40.735
who can merely make my life easier

285
00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:44.815
or make my life more comfortable or take away my enemies

286
00:13:45.035 --> 00:13:47.375
and make it all satisfying?

287
00:13:48.075 --> 00:13:49.575
Am I looking for that kind of savior

288
00:13:49.835 --> 00:13:53.015
or am I looking for the true savior?

289
00:13:55.215 --> 00:13:57.035
See, here's, here's the big idea today.

290
00:13:57.035 --> 00:13:58.795
If you're gonna write one thing down, if you do that,

291
00:13:58.795 --> 00:14:00.075
if you don't, okay, lemme just

292
00:14:00.075 --> 00:14:01.355
encourage you to remember this one thing.

293
00:14:01.355 --> 00:14:05.555
If you only remember this, great. But here it is.

294
00:14:05.585 --> 00:14:06.955
When you take all of this together,

295
00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:13.405
Jesus came not to improve our kingdom,

296
00:14:15.225 --> 00:14:16.805
but to bring us into his kingdom.

297
00:14:19.575 --> 00:14:20.645
Right? There's a difference,

298
00:14:22.155 --> 00:14:23.425
which is what they were looking for.

299
00:14:23.425 --> 00:14:25.065
Like that you take their, their mindset

300
00:14:25.205 --> 00:14:27.905
and how they're shouting and and saying and responding.

301
00:14:28.115 --> 00:14:30.745
Jesus came not to improve our kingdom,

302
00:14:31.165 --> 00:14:32.825
but to bring us into his

303
00:14:37.845 --> 00:14:39.635
where he delivers us in

304
00:14:39.635 --> 00:14:42.795
that kingdom from our deepest problems like sin

305
00:14:43.055 --> 00:14:44.595
and death and ourselves.

306
00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:49.505
He's not here to serve us and cater to us.

307
00:14:49.885 --> 00:14:52.845
He is here to bring us into his

308
00:14:52.915 --> 00:14:54.885
kingdom that he's the king of.

309
00:14:55.955 --> 00:14:58.535
And many in that crowd missed it.

310
00:15:01.015 --> 00:15:02.935
'cause what they were looking for was a new David

311
00:15:03.805 --> 00:15:05.815
like they thought son of David, okay, well we're looking

312
00:15:05.815 --> 00:15:07.375
for a new David who's gonna come in

313
00:15:07.515 --> 00:15:09.575
and fulfill what David failed at,

314
00:15:09.685 --> 00:15:11.735
what other people failed at as the king.

315
00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:13.495
David is going to be the one

316
00:15:13.515 --> 00:15:15.015
who could make Israel great again.

317
00:15:15.185 --> 00:15:18.135
Let's do that. Let's look for that. Let's long for that.

318
00:15:18.365 --> 00:15:20.455
They missed it. We often miss it too.

319
00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:27.325
What we need to be looking for is far greater than

320
00:15:27.755 --> 00:15:30.845
what they were looking for then A kingdom

321
00:15:31.065 --> 00:15:33.765
of this world far greater than David,

322
00:15:33.985 --> 00:15:36.005
far greater than anything we could search

323
00:15:36.025 --> 00:15:38.925
for here we're looking towards the true and better.

324
00:15:38.925 --> 00:15:42.915
David, the one that David himself was looking forward to.

325
00:15:44.915 --> 00:15:48.155
I mean, you keep reading in Matthew 22, in 21 into 22.

326
00:15:48.245 --> 00:15:52.595
Jesus himself affirms that statement

327
00:15:52.595 --> 00:15:54.955
that David was looking to his Lord.

328
00:15:56.595 --> 00:15:58.215
He was looking forward to a messiah

329
00:15:58.215 --> 00:15:59.615
that David knew he wasn't the one.

330
00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:02.535
And David wouldn't be if any of his sons be the one.

331
00:16:02.675 --> 00:16:04.255
He was like, there's a messiah coming

332
00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:07.015
who's gonna reign over everything.

333
00:16:11.465 --> 00:16:15.525
So we can't look for a David ish figure

334
00:16:15.825 --> 00:16:17.165
that's gonna save us here.

335
00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:19.925
Any kingdom mindset here that's gonna save us,

336
00:16:19.925 --> 00:16:21.245
deliver us, make our lives better.

337
00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.205
What we gotta look for is the true and better.

338
00:16:23.205 --> 00:16:27.005
David, the son of David who's proven himself here.

339
00:16:28.785 --> 00:16:30.075
Yeah, here's what we learned about David

340
00:16:30.075 --> 00:16:31.515
through the first Samuel series.

341
00:16:32.815 --> 00:16:36.315
We learned that David is in many ways a type

342
00:16:36.775 --> 00:16:37.915
of the Messiah.

343
00:16:38.185 --> 00:16:41.475
He's somebody who exemplifies a lot of the characteristics

344
00:16:41.695 --> 00:16:45.635
and we can learn from to show us who the Messiah is.

345
00:16:45.635 --> 00:16:46.675
He wouldn't perfect at it.

346
00:16:46.895 --> 00:16:50.675
But there's a reason the Messiah is referred to as Son

347
00:16:50.675 --> 00:16:52.915
of David, right?

348
00:16:52.915 --> 00:16:54.275
That David is a great example.

349
00:16:56.375 --> 00:17:00.835
And so like I did last week, contrasting Saul

350
00:17:00.855 --> 00:17:04.555
and Jesus to point us to the true king in many ways.

351
00:17:04.555 --> 00:17:05.595
We can do the same thing with David

352
00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.115
since he's the son of David.

353
00:17:08.965 --> 00:17:12.915
Let's contrast, compare David and Jesus.

354
00:17:12.925 --> 00:17:14.595
David had a lot more going for him.

355
00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:16.595
We didn't compare Saul with anything.

356
00:17:16.805 --> 00:17:19.995
We're gonna compare some of David with Jesus

357
00:17:20.255 --> 00:17:23.715
to learn something about Jesus today because of it.

358
00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:27.195
Contrast later. But we'll get to that.

359
00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:29.755
But there's something similar first.

360
00:17:29.775 --> 00:17:32.875
And Matthew 21 actually showed us that they both first,

361
00:17:33.225 --> 00:17:34.995
they both fulfilled prophecy.

362
00:17:36.825 --> 00:17:40.115
Both David and Jesus actually fulfilled prophecy.

363
00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:46.255
Let's start with David. This is months ago.

364
00:17:46.255 --> 00:17:48.775
But do you remember Hannah at the beginning, chapter two

365
00:17:48.775 --> 00:17:52.485
of Samuel, she prayed to God

366
00:17:52.715 --> 00:17:57.005
that he would give his king strength.

367
00:17:58.265 --> 00:17:59.435
They didn't have a king yet.

368
00:18:00.755 --> 00:18:02.485
They didn't even know they were gonna want a king.

369
00:18:04.115 --> 00:18:08.135
And she said, give strength to your king exalt the horn

370
00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:09.375
of your anointed.

371
00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:12.215
That was eventually fulfilled, not in Saul, but in David.

372
00:18:15.175 --> 00:18:18.745
Then think about when Samuel went to uh Saul

373
00:18:18.745 --> 00:18:20.345
after Saul's first rebellion.

374
00:18:23.025 --> 00:18:24.995
Saul looks at Samuel sa.

375
00:18:24.995 --> 00:18:26.395
Samuel looks at Saul and says,

376
00:18:28.055 --> 00:18:31.235
Yahweh has sought out a man after his own heart.

377
00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:35.105
A phrase used about David over and over.

378
00:18:37.645 --> 00:18:39.225
And then later when Samuel actually goes

379
00:18:39.225 --> 00:18:41.505
to anoint the next king, he goes to this little village.

380
00:18:41.565 --> 00:18:43.785
He has this family. There's eight sons land up

381
00:18:43.785 --> 00:18:44.905
and he goes through the first seven.

382
00:18:45.255 --> 00:18:48.105
None of those guys, the most unlikely one, happens

383
00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:50.265
to be the one that God looks

384
00:18:50.445 --> 00:18:52.305
and says The Lord sees not

385
00:18:52.305 --> 00:18:55.225
as man sees man looks on the outward appearance,

386
00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:59.345
but the Lord looks on the heart, David.

387
00:19:01.295 --> 00:19:03.675
And so David is the fulfillment of of prophecy

388
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.715
given to show that he's the one.

389
00:19:09.285 --> 00:19:13.865
But David comparatively was nowhere close to the amount

390
00:19:13.865 --> 00:19:17.225
of prophecies that Jesus fulfilled hundreds of years

391
00:19:17.245 --> 00:19:19.025
before Jesus came on the scene.

392
00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:22.145
There were prophecies given that he ended up fulfilling.

393
00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:25.295
Now you can go read this online somewhere.

394
00:19:25.295 --> 00:19:26.615
You can read books about this.

395
00:19:27.455 --> 00:19:31.295
Scholars actually debate the number of prophecies

396
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.055
because we define prophecy differently at times

397
00:19:33.525 --> 00:19:34.975
that Jesus actually fulfilled.

398
00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:39.475
But at a minimum, at a minimum,

399
00:19:39.665 --> 00:19:43.835
it's well over 200 specific prophecies

400
00:19:43.835 --> 00:19:45.635
that Jesus fulfilled when he showed up.

401
00:19:45.775 --> 00:19:50.315
And in his life. Sometimes people say up

402
00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:52.755
to almost 400 prophecies

403
00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:55.275
that Jesus fulfilled from the Old Testament hundreds years

404
00:19:55.275 --> 00:19:57.955
before Jesus filled them out.

405
00:19:58.605 --> 00:19:59.915
Lemme give you some examples.

406
00:20:00.975 --> 00:20:05.565
The time of his birth where he was born in Bethlehem,

407
00:20:05.875 --> 00:20:07.525
that he was gonna be born of a virgin,

408
00:20:08.315 --> 00:20:10.685
that he would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver,

409
00:20:12.175 --> 00:20:15.985
that he would be mocked, crucified, pierced, all

410
00:20:15.985 --> 00:20:18.545
that was predicted that he would die with the wicked

411
00:20:18.645 --> 00:20:19.945
but be buried with the rich.

412
00:20:19.945 --> 00:20:21.465
That was which tomb he was put in

413
00:20:21.465 --> 00:20:23.745
that he'd be from the geneal genealogy

414
00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:25.825
of David and so many more.

415
00:20:25.915 --> 00:20:28.625
Those are examples of things said hundreds of years

416
00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:32.225
before that Jesus fulfilled two exactness,

417
00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:38.965
which Jesus even kind of proves here in Matthew 21, he turns

418
00:20:38.965 --> 00:20:40.005
to his two disciples

419
00:20:40.185 --> 00:20:42.245
and he predicts when they go into

420
00:20:42.245 --> 00:20:43.285
this village, what are they gonna find?

421
00:20:44.445 --> 00:20:48.565
A donkey with a a mom donkey with its unwritten

422
00:20:49.295 --> 00:20:50.725
child, its cult.

423
00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:55.405
And he says, go find them. Bring 'em back.

424
00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:56.685
And they're like, okay. And they

425
00:20:56.685 --> 00:20:57.765
go in there and they, what do they find?

426
00:20:57.915 --> 00:21:02.405
They find a mother donkey with an unwritten cult. Hello?

427
00:21:02.715 --> 00:21:03.885
It's supposed to point them

428
00:21:03.885 --> 00:21:07.525
to something like Jesus is the fulfillment, which the,

429
00:21:07.575 --> 00:21:10.485
again, the proof of that is Zechariah nine verse nine,

430
00:21:10.755 --> 00:21:12.205
that the Messiah would show up

431
00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:13.765
as a humble king on a young donkey.

432
00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:15.005
Jesus said, watch this.

433
00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:17.205
I'm gonna fulfill it in front of you.

434
00:21:18.785 --> 00:21:20.155
They go and find it, bring it back.

435
00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:22.315
That's how we get the triumphal entry.

436
00:21:23.665 --> 00:21:25.005
So Jesus fulfilled prophecy.

437
00:21:25.005 --> 00:21:26.445
But here's what's amazing about all this.

438
00:21:26.795 --> 00:21:29.165
This just gets into some apologetics kind of stuff here.

439
00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:32.325
You just take eight prophecies,

440
00:21:33.365 --> 00:21:35.045
I mentioned seven or eight, nine, right there.

441
00:21:36.205 --> 00:21:37.255
Just take eight of them.

442
00:21:39.435 --> 00:21:43.255
The statistical probability of one person

443
00:21:43.985 --> 00:21:46.575
fulfilling just eight of those

444
00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:52.205
is something like one in 10 to the 17th power.

445
00:21:54.665 --> 00:21:56.085
Now I know you can't even visualize that number,

446
00:21:56.105 --> 00:21:57.165
so let's put it up on the screen.

447
00:21:57.345 --> 00:21:59.325
That's one with 17 zeros behind it,

448
00:22:00.785 --> 00:22:02.485
100 quadrillion.

449
00:22:05.355 --> 00:22:08.845
Imagine if you covered the state of Texas with nickels

450
00:22:09.385 --> 00:22:12.325
one foot deep and you reach in

451
00:22:12.505 --> 00:22:16.205
and you pick out the one red nickel randomly out

452
00:22:16.205 --> 00:22:17.205
of the entire place

453
00:22:17.205 --> 00:22:18.685
and you pick the right one the first time.

454
00:22:21.525 --> 00:22:24.695
That is the probability statistically

455
00:22:24.715 --> 00:22:29.295
of one person fulfilling just eight Jesus over 200, up

456
00:22:29.295 --> 00:22:31.455
to 400, fulfilled them all.

457
00:22:32.115 --> 00:22:33.415
That's stunning, isn't it?

458
00:22:35.045 --> 00:22:37.695
Like only God, there's no randomness to this.

459
00:22:37.845 --> 00:22:41.255
Only God could have set all this up for it to exactly happen

460
00:22:41.315 --> 00:22:45.175
as it did to prove who he is.

461
00:22:47.475 --> 00:22:49.815
So while they both fulfilled prophecy Jesus,

462
00:22:49.955 --> 00:22:52.975
of course in a lot bigger way, but they both did.

463
00:22:53.075 --> 00:22:54.295
Here's the second comparison.

464
00:22:56.245 --> 00:22:58.735
Both David and the son of David cared for the outcast.

465
00:23:00.685 --> 00:23:01.815
They cared for the outcast.

466
00:23:01.815 --> 00:23:05.655
Think about David at the end of one Samuel.

467
00:23:05.655 --> 00:23:07.815
We saw him kind of stepping into the kingship.

468
00:23:09.445 --> 00:23:10.535
What was he doing? He was,

469
00:23:10.915 --> 00:23:13.335
his heart was right towards being the king.

470
00:23:13.355 --> 00:23:15.735
He was walking in a way that his,

471
00:23:15.995 --> 00:23:18.295
his focus was on delivering people from

472
00:23:18.315 --> 00:23:19.415
the oppression they were in.

473
00:23:19.415 --> 00:23:21.695
He was defeating the oppressors he was protecting

474
00:23:21.695 --> 00:23:22.695
and providing for people.

475
00:23:22.965 --> 00:23:24.975
That was what the king was supposed to do.

476
00:23:25.275 --> 00:23:27.335
He was doing it as he needed to.

477
00:23:27.335 --> 00:23:29.255
We'll see it even more in Second Samuel.

478
00:23:31.025 --> 00:23:32.235
There's a forgotten son

479
00:23:32.235 --> 00:23:35.035
of Saul who's crippled from a young age

480
00:23:36.215 --> 00:23:38.035
and David takes him into his own family.

481
00:23:38.065 --> 00:23:41.055
Essentially. He cared for the outcast.

482
00:23:44.015 --> 00:23:47.725
Well, let's just take here in Matthew 21 in this just

483
00:23:47.725 --> 00:23:48.845
the temple scene.

484
00:23:48.915 --> 00:23:52.205
Just one little glimpse of Jesus' life. Way more than this.

485
00:23:52.225 --> 00:23:53.805
But look what this showed us.

486
00:23:54.065 --> 00:23:56.565
He drove out those who were keeping people from worshiping.

487
00:23:57.425 --> 00:23:58.645
He healed the blind

488
00:23:58.645 --> 00:24:00.685
and the lame as those things kept people from worshiping,

489
00:24:00.685 --> 00:24:01.925
they had to stay out in the courtyard.

490
00:24:02.035 --> 00:24:03.885
They could come in now if they were healed.

491
00:24:04.585 --> 00:24:07.045
He loved children in ways few other leaders did.

492
00:24:07.415 --> 00:24:09.365
Those kids themselves saw the Messiah.

493
00:24:09.675 --> 00:24:10.845
They're like, this is the one.

494
00:24:12.145 --> 00:24:13.725
Nobody else loved the children like that.

495
00:24:16.095 --> 00:24:18.195
See, what this is saying is that all of it points

496
00:24:18.215 --> 00:24:20.595
to the fact that Jesus came to fulfill

497
00:24:21.315 --> 00:24:24.235
prophecy from Isaiah 700 years earlier.

498
00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:27.275
This is what Jesus himself identified with Luke four.

499
00:24:27.455 --> 00:24:29.515
He says, the spirit of the Lord is upon me.

500
00:24:29.705 --> 00:24:32.315
He's anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.

501
00:24:33.255 --> 00:24:36.155
He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives recovering

502
00:24:36.155 --> 00:24:38.595
of sight to the blind to set it liberty, those

503
00:24:38.595 --> 00:24:40.675
who are oppressed to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.

504
00:24:40.695 --> 00:24:42.315
That's what Jesus came to do.

505
00:24:42.535 --> 00:24:44.075
In fact, that's also what the kings

506
00:24:44.075 --> 00:24:45.395
of Israel were supposed to do.

507
00:24:45.505 --> 00:24:49.355
Similar things like that, care for the outcast,

508
00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:53.195
make this a safe place for everyone to live.

509
00:24:57.275 --> 00:24:58.335
And so we can compare Jesus,

510
00:24:58.535 --> 00:25:00.255
I just dabbled in the surface of that a little bit.

511
00:25:01.925 --> 00:25:05.755
We can compare them, but they're not equals.

512
00:25:08.575 --> 00:25:10.275
So we also need to contrast them.

513
00:25:12.025 --> 00:25:13.795
There's some contrast between David

514
00:25:13.795 --> 00:25:17.075
and Jesus that we can learn a lot about Jesus through those.

515
00:25:20.335 --> 00:25:21.845
Again, just look at this temple scene.

516
00:25:23.435 --> 00:25:25.245
Matthew 21, look at verses 12

517
00:25:25.245 --> 00:25:29.985
and 13, specifically, Jesus entered the temple,

518
00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:32.265
drove out all who sold and bought in the temple

519
00:25:32.285 --> 00:25:34.425
and he overturned the tables, the money changers

520
00:25:34.425 --> 00:25:36.145
and the seats of those who sold pigeons.

521
00:25:36.405 --> 00:25:38.625
And he said to them, it is written again,

522
00:25:38.625 --> 00:25:39.945
this was quoted from Isaiah 56.

523
00:25:40.325 --> 00:25:42.465
My house shall be called a house of prayer.

524
00:25:43.245 --> 00:25:44.865
But you make it a den of robbers.

525
00:25:47.855 --> 00:25:49.915
Now, unfortunately, what I've heard people do with

526
00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:54.165
that passage, they've actually given them,

527
00:25:54.495 --> 00:25:56.725
given people license for temper tantrums

528
00:25:57.105 --> 00:25:58.485
and said, Hey man, they deserved it.

529
00:25:59.235 --> 00:26:01.525
They deserved it. I get to do it because they deserved it.

530
00:26:01.635 --> 00:26:04.285
Like, no, that's not what this is saying.

531
00:26:05.475 --> 00:26:07.765
This is teaching us something really important about Jesus

532
00:26:07.825 --> 00:26:10.005
and we might miss it if we're only focused on what he did

533
00:26:10.005 --> 00:26:11.445
with the tables and all that kind of stuff.

534
00:26:14.595 --> 00:26:19.075
'cause remember the temple's purpose, that was the place

535
00:26:19.075 --> 00:26:20.155
that God dwelled among his people.

536
00:26:20.705 --> 00:26:22.475
That was the place that people received

537
00:26:22.475 --> 00:26:23.835
forgiveness for their sins.

538
00:26:23.835 --> 00:26:25.795
That's how that mechanism worked.

539
00:26:26.135 --> 00:26:27.795
It was a location for worship.

540
00:26:28.095 --> 00:26:29.475
It was where all nations were

541
00:26:29.635 --> 00:26:30.675
supposed to come and be blessed.

542
00:26:30.945 --> 00:26:33.835
That was why God installed the temple.

543
00:26:35.575 --> 00:26:37.435
Yet the religious leaders

544
00:26:38.215 --> 00:26:41.195
at the time had abused it for their own gain.

545
00:26:42.745 --> 00:26:47.095
They had started to lose the mission of the temple.

546
00:26:49.285 --> 00:26:53.945
So Jesus needed to come overturn it.

547
00:26:56.055 --> 00:26:57.635
It had abandoned its original purpose.

548
00:26:57.855 --> 00:26:59.915
And so God said, Jesus, here's what we're gonna do.

549
00:26:59.915 --> 00:27:02.075
We're gonna flip the tables of this thing.

550
00:27:04.765 --> 00:27:08.025
But don't forget, again, we're contrasting David and Jesus.

551
00:27:08.155 --> 00:27:12.305
Don't forget that, that the tabernacle was

552
00:27:13.015 --> 00:27:14.665
David's system of worship.

553
00:27:16.405 --> 00:27:17.905
That's where David would worship.

554
00:27:17.965 --> 00:27:21.265
That's where David needed to receive forgiveness

555
00:27:21.265 --> 00:27:22.505
through sacrifices.

556
00:27:22.935 --> 00:27:26.905
That was where the worship happened. David was in that.

557
00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:30.585
So the contrast here is that David was in that system,

558
00:27:30.965 --> 00:27:34.025
but Jesus, we saw it here, was over that system.

559
00:27:36.865 --> 00:27:40.735
Right David, that's how he worshiped the son of David,

560
00:27:40.735 --> 00:27:44.065
though he's over that

561
00:27:45.715 --> 00:27:47.215
he was over the system.

562
00:27:47.275 --> 00:27:50.415
He had the authority to come in

563
00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:53.135
and hit the reset button on the whole thing.

564
00:27:55.235 --> 00:27:56.485
This is wrong. This is wrong.

565
00:27:56.635 --> 00:27:58.765
What authority does he have to say that?

566
00:27:58.835 --> 00:28:02.965
Well, he showed it just a couple days later

567
00:28:02.965 --> 00:28:05.285
because not only did he flip the tables in the temple,

568
00:28:05.345 --> 00:28:08.165
he also repeatedly said that his body is the temple.

569
00:28:09.545 --> 00:28:11.525
You tear it down. Three days later I'll build it back up.

570
00:28:11.525 --> 00:28:13.485
And they were like, you can't build this building like that.

571
00:28:14.155 --> 00:28:15.285
He's like, I'm not talking about that.

572
00:28:16.585 --> 00:28:17.585
I'm talking about the true temple.

573
00:28:19.745 --> 00:28:23.495
And So his authority to do that, proven by his death

574
00:28:23.555 --> 00:28:27.255
and resurrection over all the system, he can do it.

575
00:28:27.475 --> 00:28:31.575
And what we learned from that is that we don't come to God

576
00:28:31.575 --> 00:28:32.855
through a building anymore.

577
00:28:32.995 --> 00:28:37.125
We come to God through a person, the Son

578
00:28:37.125 --> 00:28:38.485
of God in the flesh.

579
00:28:39.825 --> 00:28:43.685
The Son of David is the way to the Father now,

580
00:28:45.135 --> 00:28:46.675
not through any system

581
00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:50.355
or through a person like David, it's through the son

582
00:28:50.355 --> 00:28:51.555
of God, the Son of Dave.

583
00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:56.085
So David was in the system. Jesus was over the system.

584
00:28:56.085 --> 00:28:58.725
There's one more contrast though I wanna make between David

585
00:28:58.725 --> 00:29:00.685
and Jesus and and it highlights again

586
00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:02.645
how great our God is in

587
00:29:02.645 --> 00:29:05.125
that He would send his son to be this Messiah.

588
00:29:05.135 --> 00:29:10.045
Watch this. Do you remember how David was referred to

589
00:29:10.865 --> 00:29:13.765
by Samuel, by God, by others?

590
00:29:15.235 --> 00:29:17.085
What was kind of his, his catchphrase.

591
00:29:17.105 --> 00:29:19.405
His title was one Samuel 13, 14.

592
00:29:19.425 --> 00:29:22.645
It says, the Lord has sought out a man

593
00:29:23.015 --> 00:29:24.525
after his own heart.

594
00:29:24.965 --> 00:29:28.595
Remember that? And that's how David's referred to a man

595
00:29:28.595 --> 00:29:32.375
after God's own heart, which means that he was longing

596
00:29:32.375 --> 00:29:34.695
for God, he wanted God, he pursued God.

597
00:29:34.695 --> 00:29:37.975
And that's great. It's an example for all of us.

598
00:29:38.075 --> 00:29:41.485
We should be men and women who are our hearts are after God.

599
00:29:41.675 --> 00:29:44.205
Like want him long for him, love him.

600
00:29:47.215 --> 00:29:49.595
But when we contrast David with Jesus,

601
00:29:49.735 --> 00:29:51.275
we see something even greater show

602
00:29:51.275 --> 00:29:52.275
Up.

603
00:29:53.705 --> 00:29:56.765
See, David merely had a heart after God.

604
00:29:58.535 --> 00:30:00.405
Jesus though was

605
00:30:00.895 --> 00:30:02.405
God's very heart,

606
00:30:06.245 --> 00:30:07.245
Right? David had a

607
00:30:07.245 --> 00:30:10.195
heart after God. Yes, he, he loved God.

608
00:30:10.215 --> 00:30:12.915
He wanted God. He had a heart after God.

609
00:30:13.335 --> 00:30:17.275
Yet Jesus was God's very heart in the flesh.

610
00:30:18.335 --> 00:30:19.675
He was God's heart.

611
00:30:21.685 --> 00:30:23.665
He was God's heart in the flesh.

612
00:30:23.665 --> 00:30:26.665
Listen to what Colossians one says In Jesus,

613
00:30:27.445 --> 00:30:30.545
all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell.

614
00:30:32.235 --> 00:30:36.455
It means everything that's in God is God and is in Jesus.

615
00:30:38.365 --> 00:30:40.575
Like, don't miss this. What we're saying here is that

616
00:30:40.575 --> 00:30:42.895
that like John one says, the Son of God

617
00:30:43.485 --> 00:30:45.535
took on flesh and dwelt among us.

618
00:30:47.515 --> 00:30:51.125
That means Jesus did not lose divinity in any way.

619
00:30:51.505 --> 00:30:54.725
He just added on a human nature to his divinity.

620
00:30:56.845 --> 00:31:01.695
It's not like 50 50 half human, half God, he's 100% God

621
00:31:01.915 --> 00:31:03.215
and 100% man.

622
00:31:04.535 --> 00:31:06.675
And it blows our minds to think about that. But that's true.

623
00:31:06.975 --> 00:31:08.515
He did not lose anything.

624
00:31:08.695 --> 00:31:13.595
All that is in God, the very heart of God is seen in Jesus.

625
00:31:13.735 --> 00:31:14.875
So that's why this is so important.

626
00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:18.555
Church, when we look at Jesus, we see God,

627
00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:21.815
everything about Jesus, whatever it is,

628
00:31:22.075 --> 00:31:24.415
it shows us who God is.

629
00:31:28.505 --> 00:31:32.005
Why am I telling you this? Because when we look at

630
00:31:32.005 --> 00:31:36.895
that temple scene And they saw the wonderful works

631
00:31:36.925 --> 00:31:41.495
that Jesus was doing, when we look at that scene, we saw two

632
00:31:42.045 --> 00:31:44.495
very different responses to this.

633
00:31:44.495 --> 00:31:49.445
Jesus, did you notice, right?

634
00:31:49.445 --> 00:31:51.005
The chief priests and the scribes,

635
00:31:52.505 --> 00:31:55.565
what'd they feel? They were threatened

636
00:31:56.105 --> 00:31:57.105
By this Jesus.

637
00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:58.715
They

638
00:31:59.385 --> 00:32:03.345
Instead of repenting, they doubled down,

639
00:32:04.365 --> 00:32:08.825
got frustrated, and ultimately led the charge in having

640
00:32:08.835 --> 00:32:10.745
Jesus crucified just a couple days

641
00:32:10.745 --> 00:32:14.225
Later, We're about to lose everything guys.

642
00:32:14.525 --> 00:32:15.505
He, he's look at all

643
00:32:15.505 --> 00:32:16.625
the people that're already going after him.

644
00:32:16.625 --> 00:32:18.705
We're about to lose it all. We better take care of that.

645
00:32:22.895 --> 00:32:24.235
That's one response in the temple.

646
00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:27.115
But there was a second response. Who was it? The children.

647
00:32:30.035 --> 00:32:33.215
The children recognizing who Jesus was.

648
00:32:33.605 --> 00:32:35.055
They praised him for it.

649
00:32:35.275 --> 00:32:39.605
And that is a fulfillment of Psalm eight, verse two,

650
00:32:39.695 --> 00:32:42.205
which says, outta the mouths of babes

651
00:32:42.205 --> 00:32:43.565
and infants, you've prepared praise

652
00:32:45.855 --> 00:32:47.105
that they look at this Jesus.

653
00:32:48.565 --> 00:32:51.105
And what they see is God

654
00:32:53.605 --> 00:32:56.625
two very different responses to the same moment,

655
00:32:58.125 --> 00:33:02.265
the same things they all saw, and these children looked

656
00:33:02.265 --> 00:33:03.905
and worshiped the Messiah.

657
00:33:08.095 --> 00:33:09.555
So that leaves us with the question then,

658
00:33:11.525 --> 00:33:12.425
how do you see Jesus

659
00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:18.015
if this is who he is?

660
00:33:19.115 --> 00:33:21.125
How Do you see Jesus?

661
00:33:23.365 --> 00:33:26.145
Are you trusting him to be your savior?

662
00:33:28.395 --> 00:33:30.535
And I don't just mean like eternity.

663
00:33:32.325 --> 00:33:35.805
I got my fire insurance. I'm not gonna end up away from God.

664
00:33:35.825 --> 00:33:38.365
I'm gonna be with him like I, I'm trusting him for that.

665
00:33:38.585 --> 00:33:41.565
Are you trusting him to be your savior in the middle

666
00:33:41.585 --> 00:33:46.265
of your mess today, in the middle

667
00:33:46.365 --> 00:33:48.305
of it all right now?

668
00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:54.545
Or are you looking for a different kind of savior?

669
00:33:56.765 --> 00:34:00.825
Are you looking for one who just improves your kingdom?

670
00:34:05.065 --> 00:34:06.805
Now, I wrestled with this all week.

671
00:34:08.245 --> 00:34:09.845
I asked myself like, okay, how do I know?

672
00:34:11.285 --> 00:34:13.325
I don't want I, I wanna trust him in the right ways.

673
00:34:13.485 --> 00:34:15.085
I wanna trust him as king

674
00:34:15.085 --> 00:34:17.005
and God I I don't want to trust him just

675
00:34:17.005 --> 00:34:19.045
to help me like make my life easier.

676
00:34:19.745 --> 00:34:24.355
How do I know? Same question you're asking. How do we know?

677
00:34:25.435 --> 00:34:27.015
Here's a good heart check question.

678
00:34:29.635 --> 00:34:30.945
Think about what you pray for

679
00:34:33.445 --> 00:34:35.015
when you examine your prayer life.

680
00:34:35.015 --> 00:34:36.175
Think about what you pray for.

681
00:34:38.145 --> 00:34:41.855
Is it for comfort or character?

682
00:34:45.065 --> 00:34:48.475
When you pray, God save me. God deliver me.

683
00:34:48.615 --> 00:34:53.515
Are you praying for comfort or for character?

684
00:34:57.455 --> 00:35:01.975
Are you praying That God's some kind of vending machine

685
00:35:02.805 --> 00:35:07.535
that you can get peace and comfort and ease and a nice life

686
00:35:07.875 --> 00:35:11.415
and that's what you want God to save you for four?

687
00:35:13.675 --> 00:35:18.175
Or are you praying for God to shape you in your character

688
00:35:18.285 --> 00:35:19.655
through the difficult time?

689
00:35:20.075 --> 00:35:21.855
Yes, you can pray that God would take it, but

690
00:35:21.855 --> 00:35:24.295
but your heart is not in hoping that would happen.

691
00:35:24.445 --> 00:35:27.375
Your heart is saying, God shaped me into the image of Jesus

692
00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:29.215
that I know you're doing right now.

693
00:35:31.415 --> 00:35:34.015
I surrender to your plan not to

694
00:35:34.015 --> 00:35:35.535
what I think my life should look like.

695
00:35:35.725 --> 00:35:37.805
That is a whole different way of praying, right?

696
00:35:39.385 --> 00:35:41.685
For comfort or for character. Which one are you praying?

697
00:35:41.685 --> 00:35:43.205
That's how we can see.

698
00:35:43.385 --> 00:35:45.765
Are you praying that God's this vending machine giving you

699
00:35:46.115 --> 00:35:49.045
good things, blessings, all the things that you would want?

700
00:35:49.185 --> 00:35:51.405
Or are you praying like Thomas

701
00:35:51.625 --> 00:35:54.405
did now love this passage?

702
00:35:55.515 --> 00:35:57.525
When Thomas saw Jesus

703
00:35:58.055 --> 00:36:01.605
after Jesus resurrected for the first time Thomas saw him.

704
00:36:01.745 --> 00:36:02.965
Here's how he responded.

705
00:36:03.065 --> 00:36:04.485
He said, my Lord

706
00:36:04.825 --> 00:36:05.685
and my God,

707
00:36:09.475 --> 00:36:12.535
that's how we should see Jesus.

708
00:36:12.675 --> 00:36:14.295
Do you see the son of David like that?

709
00:36:14.555 --> 00:36:16.255
Or do you see the son of David as

710
00:36:16.765 --> 00:36:19.695
this other lesser savior?

711
00:36:23.795 --> 00:36:24.815
Do you see him as your king?

712
00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:26.815
Do you see him as the one in charge, as the one

713
00:36:26.815 --> 00:36:30.735
who you submit to as the God over all that he is the true

714
00:36:30.735 --> 00:36:34.495
and better David who conquered our greatest enemies of sin

715
00:36:34.515 --> 00:36:35.895
and death and ourselves.

716
00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:37.935
That's who we should be looking for.

717
00:36:38.165 --> 00:36:41.095
Instead of this son of David, like the crowd saw him,

718
00:36:44.525 --> 00:36:48.605
who praised him one day, yet abandoned him

719
00:36:48.605 --> 00:36:50.845
and called for his crucifixion just a few days later,

720
00:36:54.235 --> 00:36:56.845
looking for the wrong kind of salvation.

721
00:37:01.175 --> 00:37:05.125
Again, remember, Jesus came not to improve our kingdom,

722
00:37:07.585 --> 00:37:08.925
but to bring us into his.

723
00:37:11.605 --> 00:37:15.225
So let's respond to him with that Hosanna idea. Save us.

724
00:37:15.565 --> 00:37:18.825
But with the right kind of perspective that who we're asking

725
00:37:18.885 --> 00:37:21.505
to save us is the king over all things.

726
00:37:23.585 --> 00:37:26.085
And his plan is better than ours.
