00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:04.685
This is Melissa Carlton

2
00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:09.365
At the age of 37.

3
00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:13.685
She said, the way she said it was that Christ knocked her

4
00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:17.485
to her knees and she trusted Christ.

5
00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:20.245
And just a couple years ago,

6
00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:24.925
but now in the last few weeks, God has just brought her

7
00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.365
to a place of conviction to say, I've never been baptized.

8
00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:29.725
I've never declared my faith publicly like that.

9
00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:32.725
And so this is what we're doing today

10
00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:34.565
and rejoicing with Melissa,

11
00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.965
what he's done in her life over the years, thankful

12
00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:41.405
for the opportunity to express that through baptism.

13
00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:45.085
And so based on your profession of faith that you gave to us

14
00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:48.645
and have talked with us over the last few weeks about I get

15
00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:50.125
to baptize you in the name of the Father,

16
00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:51.565
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

17
00:00:57.355 --> 00:00:59.965
Amen. Amen. Amen.

18
00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:03.085
Church, would you pray with me?

19
00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:07.285
Lord, I'm so thankful for these testimonies of

20
00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:10.285
life transformation, that Lord,

21
00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:12.285
you have done a work in Ryland and Melissa

22
00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:17.605
and we get to see evidence of that every day and,

23
00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:20.285
and this is an act declaring that to the world,

24
00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:23.045
to the church that you have saved.

25
00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:25.285
And so, Lord, I pray you continue

26
00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:26.565
to grow them in their faith.

27
00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:30.165
Grow them in the depth of their knowledge of you, their love

28
00:01:30.165 --> 00:01:32.285
for you and their love for others.

29
00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:35.565
As a response. Lord, this is your grace.

30
00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.485
It's a picture of death to life spiritually.

31
00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:41.965
And I pray for anyone out there who has never tasted

32
00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:44.165
and seen that you are good, that you are the Savior,

33
00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:48.045
that you are the one who can take life out of death,

34
00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:49.845
who can bring beauty out of ashes.

35
00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:53.605
These are evidences of that even today.

36
00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:58.765
Work in those lives as evidence of these testimonies

37
00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:01.085
that they've seen you.

38
00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:03.365
I pray for others to see you as well.

39
00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:06.405
Bless them, Lord, grow them. Help us as a church.

40
00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:11.365
Help them grow in their faith. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

41
00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:13.685
Amen. Amen. Amen. Church, we love you.
