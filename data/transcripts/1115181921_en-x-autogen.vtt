00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.055
Well, good morning everyone,

2
00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:22.855
and happy Labor Day weekend to you.

3
00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:26.215
My name is Aaron Ferguson.

4
00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:27.935
I'm one of the elders here at Henderson Hills,

5
00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:30.575
and we are so glad that you are here today.

6
00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:33.935
Uh, labor Day, fun fact for you.

7
00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:38.285
There's over 160 countries in the world

8
00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:39.965
that celebrate Labor Day.

9
00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:44.685
Uh, not every nation does, of course, but most of them.

10
00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:47.805
Egypt, for example, does not celebrate Labor Day.

11
00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:52.525
Everyone in Egypt works on Labor Day from the top down,

12
00:00:53.455 --> 00:00:55.685
which sounds kinda like a pyramid scheme to me,

13
00:00:56.065 --> 00:00:58.405
but don't judge me.

14
00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:02.405
Uh, we're so glad that you're here today.

15
00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:05.485
I have a special assignment today

16
00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:09.685
and my job is to look one more time at first Samuel

17
00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:14.205
before we start a series next week on Second Samuel.

18
00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:18.125
Now, John has given me

19
00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:23.245
31 chapters to go over in 35 minutes.

20
00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:29.845
He got to do this 29th and 29 sermons.

21
00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:33.805
So you're gonna have to put your seatbelt on.

22
00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:35.845
We're gonna have to hustle through today.

23
00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:39.045
Thank you John Wilmuth.

24
00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:41.645
But we'll get to that in just a minute.

25
00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:46.045
All 29 sermons are on our church website.

26
00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.245
If you missed one of those,

27
00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:49.285
you can go there and, uh, look at that.

28
00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:51.805
This is a fantastic Old Testament book

29
00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:53.685
that we're gonna review today.

30
00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:55.365
So hope you have your Bibles.

31
00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.525
We're gonna dive in and, uh,

32
00:01:57.525 --> 00:01:59.365
cover quite a bit of ground very quickly.

33
00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:01.365
Now, if you're anything like my students,

34
00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:04.805
when I say let's review, they kind of roll their eyes

35
00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:09.045
and slip into a coma, but don't do that this morning, okay?

36
00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:10.565
Don't. If you're one of those that pushes,

37
00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:12.965
skip the recap on the Netflix show.

38
00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:16.005
Resist the urge this morning,

39
00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:20.085
and, uh, I think you'll enjoy what we're about to cover.

40
00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:24.725
Besides, I binged watched all 19 hours

41
00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:27.045
of the First Samuel series for you.

42
00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:30.525
Now, I was asleep for about eight hours of it,

43
00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:31.845
but that's okay.

44
00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:34.325
We won't talk about that. So turn with me

45
00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:35.685
to Judges chapter 21.

46
00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:39.085
Let's jump right in to our study.

47
00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:42.205
While you're turning there, I want

48
00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:45.445
to give you some basics on the book of First Samuel.

49
00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:49.445
Did you know the books of First

50
00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:52.365
and second Samuel are actually one book originally

51
00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:55.925
and later translators separated them

52
00:02:55.945 --> 00:02:57.645
for organization and simplicity.

53
00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:02.325
So we get the two books today, but they used to be one,

54
00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:04.045
and though the books are named

55
00:03:04.055 --> 00:03:08.405
after Samuel, there's actually, we believe three authors,

56
00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:13.165
one Chronicles 29 29 tells us, mentions three guys, Samuel,

57
00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:18.005
of course, and then two prophets, Nathan and Gad.

58
00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:22.725
So why are the books named after Samuel? Good question.

59
00:03:22.795 --> 00:03:25.845
Well, he's the one that anoints the first two kings

60
00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:28.925
of Israel, and so they give him the credit

61
00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:30.965
for these two books.

62
00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:33.325
So there you go. There's some basics about the Book

63
00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:35.005
of one Samuel.

64
00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:36.765
Today I want to answer three questions.

65
00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:41.845
What is one Samuel all about? What happens in the book?

66
00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:44.645
Uh, what are some of the major themes in the book

67
00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:47.325
and what is the big picture of the book?

68
00:03:47.325 --> 00:03:49.765
What are we supposed to take away from

69
00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:51.045
our study of one Samuel?

70
00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:53.245
So let's do that answer.

71
00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:55.565
Question number one, what happens in one Samuel?

72
00:03:55.715 --> 00:03:59.125
Join me in judges 2125.

73
00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:03.485
To understand one Samuel, we've got to begin here.

74
00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:07.595
In those days, there was no king in Israel.

75
00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:11.435
Everyone did what was right in his own eyes. Okay?

76
00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:13.075
Why is that verse important?

77
00:04:13.505 --> 00:04:18.075
Well, before one Samuel, there were no kings, only judges.

78
00:04:19.365 --> 00:04:22.875
After one Samuel, there are kings.

79
00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:27.595
So what happens in one Samuel, they transition from judges

80
00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:29.675
to kings.

81
00:04:30.785 --> 00:04:32.275
Okay, we can all go home now.

82
00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:34.435
Now there's a little more to it than that,

83
00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:36.475
but that's a good start.

84
00:04:37.255 --> 00:04:40.075
Before one Samuel, you had judges, and

85
00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:42.635
after one Samuel, we have kings.

86
00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:45.515
Uh, during the period of judges, the people

87
00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:47.275
of God had his laws,

88
00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:50.755
and if they obeyed his laws, he blessed them.

89
00:04:50.935 --> 00:04:53.995
If, if they disobeyed, he kind of removed his blessing

90
00:04:54.615 --> 00:04:56.915
and they were conquered by some neighboring tribe,

91
00:04:57.695 --> 00:04:58.755
and then they would repent

92
00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:01.595
and God would send a, a, deliver a judge

93
00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:03.515
who would rescue them.

94
00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:05.555
And they repeat this cycle multiple times

95
00:05:06.255 --> 00:05:07.395
in the period of judges.

96
00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:09.875
So in those days, things were very chaotic.

97
00:05:11.455 --> 00:05:12.995
Now let's go to one Samuel.

98
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:15.315
We'll spend the rest of the morning in one Samuel.

99
00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:19.275
Let jump with me to chapter four, one Samuel chapter four.

100
00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:22.915
We are gonna jump right into that chaos.

101
00:05:23.235 --> 00:05:24.835
I was just talking about Israel's at

102
00:05:24.935 --> 00:05:26.035
war with the Philistines.

103
00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:31.235
There two of their priests, HNI

104
00:05:31.255 --> 00:05:34.195
and Phineas lead everybody out to war.

105
00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:36.995
Unadvised take the arc of the covenant with them,

106
00:05:37.775 --> 00:05:41.235
not a good decision and disaster strikes.

107
00:05:41.235 --> 00:05:44.835
So join me one Samuel chapter four, verse 17.

108
00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:48.585
One of the guys escapes comes back

109
00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:50.145
and talks to Eli, the high priest.

110
00:05:50.605 --> 00:05:52.025
He who brought the news answered

111
00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:56.385
and said to Eli, Israel has fled before the Philistines,

112
00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:58.805
and there has been a, a great defeat among the people.

113
00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:03.285
And your two sons, Eli Hni and Phineas are dead.

114
00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:05.245
And the Ark of God

115
00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:08.205
or the Ark of the Covenant has been captured.

116
00:06:09.705 --> 00:06:11.445
And as soon as he mentioned the Ark of God,

117
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.925
Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side

118
00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:17.245
of the gate, and his neck was broken and he died.

119
00:06:17.265 --> 00:06:18.645
For the man was old and heavy,

120
00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:22.525
and he had judged Israel for 40 years.

121
00:06:23.405 --> 00:06:26.085
Israel's defeated in battle the Ark of the Covenant stolen.

122
00:06:26.225 --> 00:06:29.005
Oh, by the way, HNE and Phineas are dead, and Eli falls over

123
00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:30.445
and, and he's out too.

124
00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:33.765
So something's happening right here at the beginning

125
00:06:34.065 --> 00:06:35.125
of one Samuel.

126
00:06:35.305 --> 00:06:38.725
And what we have is sort of a new era coming in.

127
00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:41.885
God is at work. Skip on down to verse 21.

128
00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:45.135
Eli's daughter-in-law was pregnant.

129
00:06:45.235 --> 00:06:49.375
She names the child, IBA, which means no glory,

130
00:06:50.395 --> 00:06:52.855
saying the glory has departed from Israel

131
00:06:53.055 --> 00:06:55.895
because the arc of God has been captured and

132
00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:57.415
because of her father-in-law and her husband.

133
00:06:58.115 --> 00:07:02.105
In verse 22, she says, the glory has departed from Israel.

134
00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:03.505
The arc of God has been captured.

135
00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:07.705
Now, this is one of the lowest moments in Israel's history,

136
00:07:09.085 --> 00:07:10.785
and it's into this setting

137
00:07:10.855 --> 00:07:14.345
that Samuel is born and raised.

138
00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:17.745
Now Samuel's gonna be the last judge of Israel.

139
00:07:17.745 --> 00:07:19.425
He is gonna anoint the first kings

140
00:07:19.925 --> 00:07:22.865
and transition Israel into a monarchy.

141
00:07:23.095 --> 00:07:25.225
What did they have before they had a monarchy?

142
00:07:25.225 --> 00:07:28.905
When a king is in charge, they actually had a theocracy,

143
00:07:29.905 --> 00:07:32.825
a theocracy, theo meaning God rules.

144
00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:35.305
God was ruling them directly,

145
00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:39.545
but they are going to reject God as king

146
00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:42.065
and they're gonna ask for a human king.

147
00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:44.025
So join me in one Samuel eight.

148
00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:45.025
Let's skip ahead a little bit.

149
00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:47.265
One Samuel chapter eight

150
00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:52.585
and verse four, all the elders

151
00:07:53.165 --> 00:07:56.665
of Israel gathered together came to Samuel at Rama

152
00:07:56.665 --> 00:07:59.545
and said to him, behold, you are old

153
00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:01.505
and your sons do not walk in your ways.

154
00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:03.545
Now, a point for us, a king

155
00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:05.425
to judge us like all the nations.

156
00:08:06.605 --> 00:08:08.865
But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said,

157
00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:10.305
give us a king to judge us.

158
00:08:10.325 --> 00:08:12.465
And Samuel prayed to the Lord.

159
00:08:13.405 --> 00:08:16.345
In verse seven, the Lord said to Samuel, obey the voice

160
00:08:16.365 --> 00:08:18.385
of the people in all that they say to you,

161
00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.425
for they have not rejected you,

162
00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:24.105
but they have rejected me from being king over them.

163
00:08:24.115 --> 00:08:27.625
There you can see the theocracy God ruling.

164
00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:32.465
So Israel rejects God as king. They, they want a human king.

165
00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:34.945
They wanna be like all the other nations around them.

166
00:08:35.525 --> 00:08:37.345
Samuel says, that's not a good idea.

167
00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:41.425
And he warns them about the abuse of kings.

168
00:08:41.805 --> 00:08:44.825
The people don't listen. They insist on having a king.

169
00:08:45.445 --> 00:08:49.505
And so God leads Samuel to Saul.

170
00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:52.825
Join me next chapter, chapter nine,

171
00:08:54.605 --> 00:08:56.665
in verse 17, chapter nine,

172
00:08:56.665 --> 00:09:00.905
and verse 17, when Samuel saw Saul,

173
00:09:01.565 --> 00:09:04.145
the Lord told him, here's the man of whom I spoke to you.

174
00:09:04.285 --> 00:09:08.945
It is he who shall restrain my people. Okay?

175
00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:12.265
So the Lord led Samuel to the first king Saul.

176
00:09:13.415 --> 00:09:16.265
Turn the page to chapter 10, verse 24.

177
00:09:17.645 --> 00:09:19.665
Samuel introduces Saul to the people.

178
00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:22.265
Samuel said to all the people,

179
00:09:23.805 --> 00:09:25.905
do you see him whom the Lord has chosen?

180
00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:27.825
There's none like him among all the people.

181
00:09:27.885 --> 00:09:31.225
And all the people shouted, long live the king.

182
00:09:33.495 --> 00:09:37.155
So here we go. We now have a human king named Saul.

183
00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:41.155
Now Saul has some success, but it doesn't last very long.

184
00:09:41.855 --> 00:09:43.795
Why? Because he gets off track pretty quickly.

185
00:09:44.415 --> 00:09:46.595
He disobeys some of God's commands

186
00:09:47.375 --> 00:09:49.395
and he's gonna lose the kingdom as a result.

187
00:09:50.185 --> 00:09:53.315
Skip ahead to one Samuel chapter 13,

188
00:09:54.535 --> 00:09:59.355
one Samuel chapter 13, verse 13, Samuel says

189
00:09:59.355 --> 00:10:01.035
to Saul, the Saul has disobeyed.

190
00:10:01.975 --> 00:10:03.395
You have done foolishly.

191
00:10:04.215 --> 00:10:06.275
You've not kept the command of the Lord your God,

192
00:10:06.275 --> 00:10:09.035
which he commanded you for.

193
00:10:09.035 --> 00:10:10.675
Then the Lord would've established your

194
00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:11.875
kingdom over Israel forever.

195
00:10:12.815 --> 00:10:14.875
But now your kingdom shall not continue.

196
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.155
And the Lord has sought out a man

197
00:10:17.155 --> 00:10:19.515
after his own heart that's David.

198
00:10:20.575 --> 00:10:23.555
And the Lord commanded him to be prince over his people

199
00:10:23.745 --> 00:10:27.395
because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you.

200
00:10:28.135 --> 00:10:32.395
So God took the kingdom away from Saul, gives it to David,

201
00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:35.715
and let's skip ahead into chapter 16.

202
00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:39.435
Where does that happen? Chapter 16, verse 12.

203
00:10:41.255 --> 00:10:44.195
And he, Samuel sent

204
00:10:44.215 --> 00:10:46.595
and brought him David in.

205
00:10:47.495 --> 00:10:50.555
He was ruddy, he had beautiful eyes, was handsome,

206
00:10:50.555 --> 00:10:54.915
and the Lord said, arise, anoint him, David, for this is he,

207
00:10:55.695 --> 00:10:58.075
Samuel took the horn of oil

208
00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:00.195
and anointed him in the midst of his brothers.

209
00:11:00.775 --> 00:11:03.075
And the spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from

210
00:11:03.075 --> 00:11:04.355
that day forward.

211
00:11:05.815 --> 00:11:07.955
Now, this is a very odd situation.

212
00:11:07.955 --> 00:11:09.675
You have a king sitting on the throne

213
00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:13.915
and now you have, his successor has already been anointed.

214
00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:18.675
So this is gonna cost some tension in their relationship.

215
00:11:18.775 --> 00:11:20.395
At first, Saul and David were friends.

216
00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:24.275
Uh, David served in Saul's court

217
00:11:25.055 --> 00:11:27.395
and married Saul's daughter

218
00:11:28.055 --> 00:11:29.915
and was best friends with his son.

219
00:11:30.415 --> 00:11:33.875
But then everything fell apart when David defeated Goliath

220
00:11:34.815 --> 00:11:37.235
and the Philistines, Saul became jealous.

221
00:11:38.535 --> 00:11:42.275
Uh, the women sung Saul has killed his thousands

222
00:11:42.275 --> 00:11:45.515
and David his 10 thousands, right?

223
00:11:45.515 --> 00:11:47.955
Look, with with me at, uh, chapter 18,

224
00:11:48.845 --> 00:11:51.115
everything turns in their relationship.

225
00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:57.265
Chapter 18, verse eight, Saul was very angry.

226
00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:02.605
This saying displeased him, he said, they have ascribed

227
00:12:02.665 --> 00:12:05.045
to David 10,000 and to me, thousands.

228
00:12:05.955 --> 00:12:07.565
What more can he have? But the kingdom

229
00:12:08.265 --> 00:12:11.485
and Saul ied David, from that day on,

230
00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:13.765
he was suspicious of David.

231
00:12:13.795 --> 00:12:17.485
From that day on for the rest of the book, chapters 18

232
00:12:17.505 --> 00:12:21.245
to 31, Saul pursues David tries to kill him,

233
00:12:22.305 --> 00:12:25.405
and David literally goes on the run until Saul dies

234
00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:28.245
in battle in chapter 31.

235
00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:32.805
So Israel's monarchy is off to a rocky start.

236
00:12:34.335 --> 00:12:36.275
Saul's administration is a disaster.

237
00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:38.235
The Philistines defeat Israel.

238
00:12:39.065 --> 00:12:40.755
They're no better off than they were

239
00:12:40.815 --> 00:12:42.475
before they had a human king.

240
00:12:42.475 --> 00:12:43.795
They're no better off than they were,

241
00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:45.355
than in the period of judges.

242
00:12:47.015 --> 00:12:48.875
So that's the book of one Samuel.

243
00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:51.755
There's a whole lot of other plots and subplots,

244
00:12:51.775 --> 00:12:53.795
but you get the gist here of what happened.

245
00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:57.835
Now that Saul is dead, we're gonna open up next week,

246
00:12:58.135 --> 00:13:00.755
second Samuel and David is gonna be king,

247
00:13:01.175 --> 00:13:04.475
and we'll take off, uh, from there with our new series.

248
00:13:05.665 --> 00:13:07.995
Okay, second question.

249
00:13:08.785 --> 00:13:11.395
What are we supposed to take from a book like one Samuel?

250
00:13:11.465 --> 00:13:12.755
What are the major themes?

251
00:13:12.755 --> 00:13:16.275
What are we be looking for in the book of one Samuel?

252
00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:21.075
Well, I have chosen four this morning, four major themes,

253
00:13:21.095 --> 00:13:22.995
and when you put them together, they make a big picture.

254
00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:26.685
And we'll see that picture here in just a minute.

255
00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:30.485
Let's talk about the four themes. First, four themes.

256
00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:32.885
Now, this obviously probably more than four,

257
00:13:32.985 --> 00:13:35.325
but here's the four that I jump out at me.

258
00:13:35.895 --> 00:13:39.805
Theme number one in one Samuel is kings. Kings.

259
00:13:40.025 --> 00:13:43.325
No surprise there. Israel transitioned from

260
00:13:43.425 --> 00:13:45.765
judges two kings.

261
00:13:46.705 --> 00:13:49.085
Now, some 500 years earlier though,

262
00:13:50.635 --> 00:13:55.015
God told Abraham that his descendants would produce kings.

263
00:13:55.015 --> 00:13:57.095
Listen to Genesis 17, six.

264
00:13:58.285 --> 00:14:02.065
God said to Abraham, I'll make you exceedingly fruitful

265
00:14:02.065 --> 00:14:03.345
and I'll make you into nations

266
00:14:03.845 --> 00:14:06.465
and kings shall come from you.

267
00:14:08.005 --> 00:14:09.785
The partial fulfillment of

268
00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:11.985
that prophecy happens here in one Samuel.

269
00:14:12.725 --> 00:14:16.905
We get Saul, we get David, and I say partial fulfillment

270
00:14:16.905 --> 00:14:19.145
because there's more to come, which we'll get

271
00:14:19.145 --> 00:14:20.225
to later in just a minute.

272
00:14:21.325 --> 00:14:24.785
Israel thought having a human king would

273
00:14:24.785 --> 00:14:26.185
answer all their problems.

274
00:14:26.885 --> 00:14:30.905
But the problem is human kings are just as flawed as we are.

275
00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:33.565
And so there's trouble.

276
00:14:34.475 --> 00:14:38.005
Only God is a perfect king

277
00:14:38.065 --> 00:14:41.085
who can reign in justice and wisdom.

278
00:14:41.535 --> 00:14:43.765
Human leaders will always disappoint.

279
00:14:44.545 --> 00:14:48.005
But that's the first theme in one Samuel is kings.

280
00:14:48.185 --> 00:14:49.325
How about the second theme?

281
00:14:49.425 --> 00:14:53.595
The second theme in one Samuel is obedience. Obedience.

282
00:14:53.865 --> 00:14:55.555
Turn with me to chapter 15.

283
00:14:57.025 --> 00:14:59.195
Chapter 15, right in the middle

284
00:14:59.215 --> 00:15:02.995
of one Samuel is the turning point of the book.

285
00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:07.875
God expected obedience from everyone in the story.

286
00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:12.995
His people, his priests, and his kings.

287
00:15:13.655 --> 00:15:15.555
If they obeyed God, he blessed them.

288
00:15:15.615 --> 00:15:18.675
If they didn't obey God, he removes their the blessing.

289
00:15:19.215 --> 00:15:22.755
And the turning point comes when Saul Disobeys God,

290
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:27.615
chapter 15, verse 22, Samuel says to

291
00:15:28.285 --> 00:15:32.655
Saul, has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings

292
00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:35.455
and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord.

293
00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:40.295
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice.

294
00:15:41.725 --> 00:15:43.145
Go on to the end of 23

295
00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:46.905
because you, Saul have rejected the word of the Lord.

296
00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:48.425
You've disobeyed.

297
00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:52.505
He has also rejected you from becoming king

298
00:15:54.505 --> 00:15:55.525
or from being King.

299
00:15:56.185 --> 00:15:57.365
Saul's success is king,

300
00:15:57.425 --> 00:16:00.965
was dependent on whether he was obedient to God.

301
00:16:00.965 --> 00:16:04.965
Now, God is speaking to Saul here in this passage,

302
00:16:05.105 --> 00:16:06.845
but in a larger sense, he's speaking

303
00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:08.285
to the whole nation of Israel.

304
00:16:08.515 --> 00:16:11.725
Obedience matters to God.

305
00:16:12.065 --> 00:16:14.725
And even in a larger sense, he's speaking to us today.

306
00:16:15.595 --> 00:16:18.605
Obedience matters to God.

307
00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:21.485
Jesus said in John 14, if you love me,

308
00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:24.605
you will keep my commandments.

309
00:16:24.915 --> 00:16:28.765
Obedience matters even in the New Testament.

310
00:16:28.765 --> 00:16:32.805
So obedience matters to God, but Saul was disobedient

311
00:16:33.185 --> 00:16:35.325
and he's gonna lose the kingdom.

312
00:16:36.065 --> 00:16:40.445
So theme number one, kings theme number two is obedience.

313
00:16:40.445 --> 00:16:41.765
How about theme number three?

314
00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:45.205
Theme number three is the sovereignty of God.

315
00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:48.085
The sovereignty of God.

316
00:16:48.695 --> 00:16:51.445
Don't be scared of the word sovereignty.

317
00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:54.645
It just means power of God, authority of God.

318
00:16:54.715 --> 00:16:56.365
He's in charge, he's in control.

319
00:16:57.035 --> 00:16:59.845
Turn with me to chapter two, back at the beginning

320
00:17:00.905 --> 00:17:02.005
of the book.

321
00:17:04.425 --> 00:17:07.605
You know, when we identify characters of this book,

322
00:17:07.605 --> 00:17:08.805
several people come to mind.

323
00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:14.365
Eli, the high priest, Samuel, the last judge, Saul,

324
00:17:14.845 --> 00:17:18.125
Jonathan, David, even Hannah, who prays for a son.

325
00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:19.365
There's lots of characters here,

326
00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:23.885
but the main character in the story is none of those people.

327
00:17:24.115 --> 00:17:28.845
It's God. God is the main character of one Samuel.

328
00:17:28.995 --> 00:17:30.445
He's the one directing the action.

329
00:17:30.715 --> 00:17:34.445
Look with me at the prayer. Hannah's praying for a son.

330
00:17:34.445 --> 00:17:35.965
Look at chapter two, verse seven.

331
00:17:37.985 --> 00:17:40.805
She says, the Lord makes poor and makes rich.

332
00:17:41.705 --> 00:17:43.565
He brings low and he exalts.

333
00:17:43.585 --> 00:17:45.565
He raises up the pore from the dust.

334
00:17:46.675 --> 00:17:50.725
He lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit

335
00:17:50.725 --> 00:17:52.605
with princes and inherit a seat of honor.

336
00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:56.205
For the pillars of the earth are the Lords.

337
00:17:56.225 --> 00:17:58.125
And on them, he has set the world.

338
00:17:59.025 --> 00:18:02.805
Hannah recognizes God's sovereignty.

339
00:18:02.995 --> 00:18:04.685
He's the one that's in control here.

340
00:18:04.715 --> 00:18:06.045
He's the one that's in charge.

341
00:18:07.385 --> 00:18:09.285
Now, where do we see God's sovereignty?

342
00:18:09.285 --> 00:18:10.445
In the book of one Samuel?

343
00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:13.365
Well, let me share a few things with you,

344
00:18:13.365 --> 00:18:14.485
Hannah, at the very beginning.

345
00:18:14.545 --> 00:18:16.725
Praise to the Lord for a child,

346
00:18:17.385 --> 00:18:21.205
she recognizes God is the one who controls childbirth.

347
00:18:21.795 --> 00:18:26.085
He's sovereign. God holds Eli, the high priest

348
00:18:26.225 --> 00:18:28.125
and his sons accountable.

349
00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:31.845
He's the judge holding Israel's spiritual

350
00:18:31.845 --> 00:18:33.085
leaders accountable.

351
00:18:33.825 --> 00:18:35.045
God handed over Israel

352
00:18:35.045 --> 00:18:36.805
to the Philistines or the Philistines.

353
00:18:37.105 --> 00:18:40.565
God protected the Ark of the Covenant when it was captured,

354
00:18:40.785 --> 00:18:42.925
God gave Samuel permission to choose a king.

355
00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:46.325
God kept King Saul accountable to obeying him.

356
00:18:47.885 --> 00:18:50.065
God chose David as the second king.

357
00:18:50.645 --> 00:18:53.785
And God protected David from Saul.

358
00:18:54.445 --> 00:18:56.825
You know, we always tend to focus on the the main

359
00:18:56.825 --> 00:18:58.545
characters, those who are on the stage.

360
00:18:59.045 --> 00:19:01.785
But it's God who is working behind the scenes here.

361
00:19:01.895 --> 00:19:05.505
He's the main character directing all the action.

362
00:19:06.585 --> 00:19:10.205
So Hannah, Eli, Samuel, Saul, David, all had

363
00:19:10.205 --> 00:19:13.245
to wait on the Lord for their directions.

364
00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:17.235
He is sovereign. He is sovereign.

365
00:19:17.775 --> 00:19:21.035
Now, God was sovereign then. And guess what?

366
00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:24.435
He's sovereign today. Even in your life,

367
00:19:25.495 --> 00:19:26.755
you might think you're in charge

368
00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:28.155
of your life, but you're not.

369
00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:34.105
He is. You might think at times, no one's in control.

370
00:19:34.105 --> 00:19:37.545
Look at the chaos all around us. Someone's in control.

371
00:19:37.935 --> 00:19:41.905
It's God. He's behind the scenes directing all things

372
00:19:42.085 --> 00:19:43.505
to fulfill his purposes.

373
00:19:43.505 --> 00:19:46.225
One of my favorite verses, Proverbs 16, nine,

374
00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:47.385
we may plan our way,

375
00:19:47.385 --> 00:19:50.665
but it's the Lord who directs our steps.

376
00:19:51.725 --> 00:19:52.945
You can plan all day long,

377
00:19:52.945 --> 00:19:54.745
but it's God who is behind the scenes.

378
00:19:54.885 --> 00:19:58.465
He is sovereign. So theme number one, kings theme.

379
00:19:58.465 --> 00:20:01.545
Number two, obedience theme. Number three, sovereignty.

380
00:20:02.515 --> 00:20:05.225
Theme number four might not seem as obvious

381
00:20:05.365 --> 00:20:08.385
as the other three, but this one really jumps out at me.

382
00:20:08.385 --> 00:20:10.905
And that is the chase. The chase.

383
00:20:12.215 --> 00:20:15.395
There are three chases in one Samuel.

384
00:20:16.025 --> 00:20:20.155
What do I mean chase? Number one is Israel.

385
00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:25.075
Israel was God's chosen nation set on earth to glorify him,

386
00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:26.475
be different, be unique.

387
00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:30.715
But instead of doing that, they wanted

388
00:20:30.715 --> 00:20:33.355
to be like all the other nations.

389
00:20:34.105 --> 00:20:37.315
They were chasing after the world.

390
00:20:38.385 --> 00:20:39.875
They didn't wanna be different.

391
00:20:40.425 --> 00:20:42.115
They wanted to be just like the world.

392
00:20:42.695 --> 00:20:47.325
That's the first chase. Israel chased the world's likeness.

393
00:20:48.265 --> 00:20:50.725
The second person that chases somebody is Saul,

394
00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:52.245
probably the one you're thinking of.

395
00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:55.725
God had chosen Saul to be the first king

396
00:20:55.745 --> 00:20:57.045
of his chosen nation,

397
00:20:57.105 --> 00:20:59.245
and his descendants could have been kings forever.

398
00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:03.765
God says, but instead of doing what God wanted,

399
00:21:04.705 --> 00:21:07.205
he spends all of his time chasing after David.

400
00:21:09.915 --> 00:21:13.165
He's completely obsessed with chasing David

401
00:21:13.465 --> 00:21:14.605
and even killing David.

402
00:21:15.465 --> 00:21:19.445
He couldn't allow for somebody to be more loved

403
00:21:19.785 --> 00:21:21.885
or more valuable than him.

404
00:21:22.905 --> 00:21:26.725
So rather than focus on what God wanted, he's chasing David

405
00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:27.845
and wasting his time.

406
00:21:29.185 --> 00:21:31.495
Chase number three is David.

407
00:21:32.765 --> 00:21:37.715
David Bible says he's a man after God's own heart.

408
00:21:38.695 --> 00:21:41.035
He chases hard after the Lord.

409
00:21:41.975 --> 00:21:45.155
In one Samuel, his relationship with the Lord,

410
00:21:45.165 --> 00:21:49.275
especially trusts in him in ways no one else would.

411
00:21:49.295 --> 00:21:51.515
You remember the story of Goliath?

412
00:21:51.515 --> 00:21:53.115
Everybody's afraid of Goliath.

413
00:21:53.585 --> 00:21:55.275
They see Goliath, they don't see God.

414
00:21:55.575 --> 00:21:57.635
He shows up and he sees God and not Goliath.

415
00:21:58.385 --> 00:22:00.195
There's something different about this guy.

416
00:22:00.225 --> 00:22:01.755
He's chasing hard after the Lord.

417
00:22:02.415 --> 00:22:05.875
He worships God when he is in the desert, getting chased

418
00:22:05.875 --> 00:22:08.835
by Saul, he writes Psalms about the Lord.

419
00:22:08.855 --> 00:22:13.275
Listen to Psalm 18. I love you, Lord.

420
00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:16.635
My strength, the Lord is my rock, my fortress, my deliverer,

421
00:22:17.055 --> 00:22:18.275
my God, my rock

422
00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:21.555
and whom I take refuge, my shield, the horn

423
00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:23.795
of my salvation, my stronghold.

424
00:22:24.795 --> 00:22:27.315
I call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised.

425
00:22:27.415 --> 00:22:29.595
I'm saved from my enemies.

426
00:22:30.125 --> 00:22:32.795
David was chasing the Lord.

427
00:22:34.045 --> 00:22:37.265
The chase is your fourth theme.

428
00:22:38.005 --> 00:22:40.385
Now let me stop right here and ask you a question.

429
00:22:41.005 --> 00:22:42.505
Who are you chasing today?

430
00:22:45.235 --> 00:22:46.295
Who are you chasing today?

431
00:22:46.295 --> 00:22:48.175
Many of you might be chasing the world.

432
00:22:50.815 --> 00:22:53.075
You wanna be like the world, rather than being indifferent.

433
00:22:53.075 --> 00:22:56.015
You wanna blend in with the world.

434
00:22:56.015 --> 00:22:57.135
You don't wanna stand out.

435
00:22:58.035 --> 00:23:01.975
But the Bible tells us, do not be conformed to this world

436
00:23:02.635 --> 00:23:05.175
and don't even love the world or the things of the world.

437
00:23:05.235 --> 00:23:06.775
The world is passing away.

438
00:23:07.795 --> 00:23:10.535
Why waste time trying to be like the world?

439
00:23:12.575 --> 00:23:14.425
Some of you may be chasing the image

440
00:23:14.565 --> 00:23:16.265
of others like Saul was.

441
00:23:18.695 --> 00:23:22.675
You have fallen for the lie that others are more loved, more

442
00:23:23.755 --> 00:23:28.005
valuable, more this, more that you look at others

443
00:23:28.185 --> 00:23:30.085
as your standard of perfection.

444
00:23:30.705 --> 00:23:32.525
You know, young people are being taken today

445
00:23:32.585 --> 00:23:33.605
by this very thing.

446
00:23:34.105 --> 00:23:38.125
Social media is the bar for the image today.

447
00:23:39.295 --> 00:23:41.315
And if they are not liked and followed

448
00:23:41.455 --> 00:23:43.635
and praised by an audience, they don't know what to do.

449
00:23:43.635 --> 00:23:46.685
They're chasing after the image of others.

450
00:23:49.065 --> 00:23:50.875
When we should be chasing after the Lord.

451
00:23:51.025 --> 00:23:53.635
Like David, are you in God's word?

452
00:23:53.815 --> 00:23:56.795
Are you listening to him trying

453
00:23:56.795 --> 00:23:58.275
to discern his will for your life?

454
00:23:58.335 --> 00:23:59.875
Are you trying to glorify him?

455
00:24:00.915 --> 00:24:04.245
Wherever that takes you at work, at school,

456
00:24:05.105 --> 00:24:07.405
in your neighborhood, wherever you go,

457
00:24:07.505 --> 00:24:08.845
you're chasing the Lord.

458
00:24:09.205 --> 00:24:11.605
Whatever it is for he wants for your life

459
00:24:11.625 --> 00:24:12.645
and glorifying him.

460
00:24:12.645 --> 00:24:16.585
And all you do, who are you chasing today?

461
00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:21.105
What is consuming your time, your energy and your treasure?

462
00:24:21.205 --> 00:24:25.545
Is it the world? Is it others? Is it the Lord?

463
00:24:26.975 --> 00:24:30.665
Well, those are the four themes that I see in one Samuel.

464
00:24:31.285 --> 00:24:33.985
Now let's put those four puzzle pieces together

465
00:24:34.925 --> 00:24:39.145
and we start to see a big picture here in one Samuel,

466
00:24:39.245 --> 00:24:40.585
and I'll wrap up with this today.

467
00:24:41.055 --> 00:24:44.385
What is the big picture of one Samuel? It's pretty simple.

468
00:24:45.015 --> 00:24:49.285
It's Christ. Jesus says himself.

469
00:24:49.395 --> 00:24:52.565
Luke 24, all the Old Testament books

470
00:24:52.815 --> 00:24:54.445
point to him.

471
00:24:56.135 --> 00:24:59.035
So the big picture of any book in the Old Testament is

472
00:24:59.035 --> 00:25:01.795
Christ, no matter what book you're reading,

473
00:25:01.895 --> 00:25:05.515
Christ is the key to understanding it.

474
00:25:05.575 --> 00:25:08.595
So we have to look at one Samuel with the lens

475
00:25:09.735 --> 00:25:12.755
of the Messiah to come Jesus Christ

476
00:25:13.615 --> 00:25:16.435
and ask ourselves, how does this book point to Christ?

477
00:25:17.255 --> 00:25:18.475
So let's answer that question.

478
00:25:18.535 --> 00:25:22.755
How does this book, first Samuel point to Christ?

479
00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:24.435
Turn back with me to chapter two.

480
00:25:24.495 --> 00:25:29.355
Let me show you some things in chapter two, Hannah,

481
00:25:29.465 --> 00:25:34.375
when she's praying for a son, a child points

482
00:25:34.375 --> 00:25:36.715
to Christ in her prayer.

483
00:25:36.745 --> 00:25:38.635
Look at first Samuel two in verse 10.

484
00:25:38.715 --> 00:25:39.795
Second half of verse 10,

485
00:25:40.335 --> 00:25:42.035
the Lord will judge the ends of the earth.

486
00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:45.335
She says He will give strength to his king

487
00:25:45.355 --> 00:25:47.055
and exalt the horn of his anointed.

488
00:25:48.395 --> 00:25:52.475
Now, is this a prophecy of Saul or David?

489
00:25:53.845 --> 00:25:55.035
Could be partially,

490
00:25:55.935 --> 00:25:58.835
but this is also a prophecy of the anointed,

491
00:25:58.835 --> 00:25:59.875
the king that is to come.

492
00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:04.075
Jesus Christ, she's pointing to Christ who is to come.

493
00:26:05.775 --> 00:26:09.785
Look on down at uh, verse 35, God prophesied to Eli of a,

494
00:26:10.085 --> 00:26:12.065
of a perfect priest to come someday.

495
00:26:12.485 --> 00:26:15.105
In verse 35, I will raise up

496
00:26:15.105 --> 00:26:19.785
for myself a faithful priest who shall do according to

497
00:26:19.785 --> 00:26:23.665
what is in my heart and in my mind was that

498
00:26:24.545 --> 00:26:26.025
answered in Samuel.

499
00:26:27.705 --> 00:26:31.875
Partially it's gonna be ultimately fulfilled in Christ.

500
00:26:32.175 --> 00:26:36.075
Samuel is actually a picture of Christ.

501
00:26:36.525 --> 00:26:39.355
Think about it. He was dedicated to the Lord from birth.

502
00:26:39.775 --> 00:26:42.155
He spends a whole lot of time in the house of God,

503
00:26:42.155 --> 00:26:45.805
the tabernacle, and he was Israel's spiritual leader.

504
00:26:46.785 --> 00:26:48.125
So he's a picture of Christ.

505
00:26:48.185 --> 00:26:50.405
Listen to, uh, verse 26, if you're right there.

506
00:26:50.465 --> 00:26:51.565
Go back to verse 26.

507
00:26:52.105 --> 00:26:56.085
The boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature

508
00:26:56.425 --> 00:27:00.585
and in favor with the Lord and also with man Jesus.

509
00:27:00.845 --> 00:27:03.105
The same thing, instead of Jesus as a boy.

510
00:27:03.215 --> 00:27:07.785
Luke 2 52, if you like to connect verses here, Luke 2 52,

511
00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:10.785
Jesus grew in stature and wisdom

512
00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:13.145
and in favor with God, in favor with man.

513
00:27:13.295 --> 00:27:17.185
This is the Bible's way of linking Samuel to Christ.

514
00:27:17.975 --> 00:27:22.945
He's a picture. He's a, he's a type of Christ. So is David.

515
00:27:23.615 --> 00:27:24.705
David's a picture of Christ.

516
00:27:24.705 --> 00:27:28.355
We're gonna see that in Second Samuel, okay?

517
00:27:29.015 --> 00:27:30.275
But the real picture

518
00:27:30.695 --> 00:27:33.515
of Christ is when we put those four themes together

519
00:27:34.415 --> 00:27:36.075
and they start to fit like a puzzle.

520
00:27:36.615 --> 00:27:40.155
So let's do that as we close today. Take those four themes.

521
00:27:40.215 --> 00:27:42.115
How do we see Christ in those four themes?

522
00:27:43.025 --> 00:27:46.675
Well, first in the theme of kings, the kings

523
00:27:46.675 --> 00:27:51.595
of Israel are gonna foreshadow the greater king who is

524
00:27:51.595 --> 00:27:53.475
to come, the Messiah Christ.

525
00:27:54.575 --> 00:27:56.915
Listen to, uh, Isaiah chapter nine.

526
00:27:56.945 --> 00:27:59.155
This is, uh, typically a passage we

527
00:27:59.155 --> 00:28:00.315
read around Christmas time.

528
00:28:01.735 --> 00:28:04.675
For to us, a child is born to us, a son is given,

529
00:28:04.895 --> 00:28:07.115
and the government shall be upon his shoulder,

530
00:28:07.895 --> 00:28:10.035
and his name shall be called wonderful counselor,

531
00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:13.115
mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace,

532
00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:16.835
of the increase of his government and of his peace.

533
00:28:16.835 --> 00:28:20.425
There will be no end on the throne of David

534
00:28:20.605 --> 00:28:23.985
and over his kingdom to establish it, to uphold it

535
00:28:23.985 --> 00:28:25.425
with justice and with righteousness.

536
00:28:25.895 --> 00:28:27.105
From this time forth

537
00:28:27.445 --> 00:28:31.345
and forevermore, Jesus is the king to come.

538
00:28:32.685 --> 00:28:34.185
The kings in Israel

539
00:28:34.205 --> 00:28:37.425
and one Samuel foreshadow the great king who is to come.

540
00:28:37.805 --> 00:28:42.515
How about theme number two, obedience. Obedience.

541
00:28:43.005 --> 00:28:46.035
Human kings, of course, are imperfect.

542
00:28:46.745 --> 00:28:48.355
They do not obey perfectly.

543
00:28:48.355 --> 00:28:50.515
But the king to come, the Messiah

544
00:28:51.605 --> 00:28:53.815
will obey perfectly.

545
00:28:54.595 --> 00:28:59.295
In fact, Christ obeyed his father all the way to the cross.

546
00:28:59.965 --> 00:29:03.335
Philippians chapter two, verse eight, Paul says,

547
00:29:03.905 --> 00:29:08.055
being found in human form, he Jesus humbled himself

548
00:29:08.195 --> 00:29:12.815
by becoming obedient, even to the point of death.

549
00:29:13.425 --> 00:29:14.535
Death on a cross.

550
00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:19.495
Jesus was perfectly obedient to his father.

551
00:29:20.365 --> 00:29:24.715
Hebrews chapter four, uh, the author

552
00:29:24.715 --> 00:29:27.595
of Hebrews says, Jesus was obedient and never sinned.

553
00:29:27.975 --> 00:29:30.515
He obeyed God perfectly.

554
00:29:30.575 --> 00:29:32.395
So the theme of obedience

555
00:29:33.185 --> 00:29:36.595
here is fulfilled in the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

556
00:29:37.695 --> 00:29:39.875
How about that third theme, sovereignty.

557
00:29:41.005 --> 00:29:43.205
Absolutely because of his obedience.

558
00:29:43.415 --> 00:29:47.325
Jesus is given the name above all names.

559
00:29:48.555 --> 00:29:51.015
And he even tells his disciples, Matthew 28,

560
00:29:51.555 --> 00:29:53.775
all authority has been given in heaven

561
00:29:53.915 --> 00:29:58.255
and on earth to me, he is sovereign.

562
00:29:58.355 --> 00:30:00.455
He is the Lord of all.

563
00:30:01.115 --> 00:30:04.415
And one day he will return to rule over his kingdom.

564
00:30:05.115 --> 00:30:06.815
He shall reign.

565
00:30:07.445 --> 00:30:12.095
That was our, our title for the series of one Samuel.

566
00:30:12.395 --> 00:30:17.215
He Shall Reign. Okay, what about the fourth theme?

567
00:30:17.435 --> 00:30:19.695
The chase. The chase.

568
00:30:20.475 --> 00:30:23.575
Now, Jesus was more than just a man after God's own heart.

569
00:30:24.435 --> 00:30:26.575
He was actually God in the flesh.

570
00:30:27.675 --> 00:30:31.015
And he does something that Adam could not do, something

571
00:30:31.015 --> 00:30:34.055
that Israel could not do, something that Saul

572
00:30:34.115 --> 00:30:36.175
and David could not do.

573
00:30:36.555 --> 00:30:40.855
He glorifies the Lord in a way no one else can do.

574
00:30:42.195 --> 00:30:44.215
In fact, when he is baptized Matthew three,

575
00:30:45.155 --> 00:30:47.615
God the Father says, this is my beloved son

576
00:30:47.615 --> 00:30:49.935
and whom I am well pleased.

577
00:30:50.995 --> 00:30:53.895
And Jesus, at the end of his life, John chapter 17 says,

578
00:30:54.495 --> 00:30:55.775
I have glorified you

579
00:30:55.775 --> 00:30:57.455
and everything I've done, I've accomplished

580
00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:58.815
everything you sent me to do.

581
00:30:59.675 --> 00:31:01.175
No one else has done this.

582
00:31:01.395 --> 00:31:04.695
Not Adam, not Israel, not Saul, not David.

583
00:31:04.955 --> 00:31:06.935
No one could glorify or chase

584
00:31:07.145 --> 00:31:10.455
after the Lord like Jesus did.

585
00:31:11.155 --> 00:31:13.455
So you put all four themes together

586
00:31:14.635 --> 00:31:17.375
and they make a beautiful picture of Christ.

587
00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:21.355
So guess what? Second Samuel's gonna be all about Christ.

588
00:31:22.135 --> 00:31:23.755
We don't need to listen to the next series

589
00:31:23.755 --> 00:31:25.835
because we know it's all about now.

590
00:31:26.595 --> 00:31:29.115
I do ask you to come next week as we open up Second Samuel,

591
00:31:29.255 --> 00:31:34.035
but we know ahead of time it's going to be about Christ.

592
00:31:34.495 --> 00:31:38.275
So how do I recap First Samuel as we close,

593
00:31:39.385 --> 00:31:42.515
it's the story of Israel's first kings

594
00:31:43.255 --> 00:31:44.795
who fail miserably.

595
00:31:46.945 --> 00:31:50.245
But it's also a story that foreshadows the king to come.

596
00:31:51.305 --> 00:31:55.485
The Messiah, Jesus Christ, who obeys his father perfectly,

597
00:31:55.675 --> 00:31:59.485
goes to the cross, dies for our sin,

598
00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:01.925
is raised from the grave,

599
00:32:02.145 --> 00:32:04.605
and he'll come back someday to reign again.

600
00:32:05.145 --> 00:32:09.685
He shall reign. That is first Samuel.

601
00:32:09.785 --> 00:32:14.205
So we are ready for Second Samuel next week.

602
00:32:15.495 --> 00:32:18.045
Lemme close with just a few questions for you as we

603
00:32:18.735 --> 00:32:20.205
enter into a time of prayer.

604
00:32:23.085 --> 00:32:27.945
Who is your king this morning? Who is your king?

605
00:32:29.045 --> 00:32:33.115
Is it you? Is it God?

606
00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:37.845
Who's calling the shots in your life right now?

607
00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:40.725
Who is it that you are obeying?

608
00:32:42.155 --> 00:32:45.535
How are you doing at obeying the Lord?

609
00:32:47.075 --> 00:32:50.175
Are you recognizing God's sovereignty in your life?

610
00:32:51.495 --> 00:32:55.335
I can plan my way, but Lord direct my steps.

611
00:32:56.755 --> 00:32:58.655
And who are you chasing today?

612
00:33:00.475 --> 00:33:03.415
Are you chasing after the world and all it has

613
00:33:03.475 --> 00:33:05.055
and all it tells you that you need?

614
00:33:06.555 --> 00:33:08.375
Are you chasing after the image of others

615
00:33:09.895 --> 00:33:11.635
or are you chasing hard after the Lord?

616
00:33:13.105 --> 00:33:15.125
You know, you and I were created a glorified God.

617
00:33:15.865 --> 00:33:16.965
He is our king.

618
00:33:19.065 --> 00:33:22.385
We are to love him and obey him

619
00:33:23.675 --> 00:33:27.415
and pursue him more than anything else in your life.

620
00:33:28.805 --> 00:33:31.785
He shall reign one day as King of all.

621
00:33:32.365 --> 00:33:36.425
But is he reigning right now in your heart today,

622
00:33:38.435 --> 00:33:39.385
let's pray together

623
00:33:45.255 --> 00:33:48.355
As you have your head bowed and eyes closed.

624
00:33:49.305 --> 00:33:51.075
Just to make you aware again, we have men

625
00:33:51.075 --> 00:33:53.795
and women who are here to pray for you.

626
00:33:53.795 --> 00:33:55.555
They're on both sides of the auditorium.

627
00:33:55.555 --> 00:33:57.435
If you have something you need prayed for today,

628
00:33:58.265 --> 00:33:59.555
they would love to do that.

629
00:34:02.205 --> 00:34:04.025
But right there in your chair, I want you to think

630
00:34:06.495 --> 00:34:07.645
about the answer to some

631
00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:09.205
of those questions I just asked you.

632
00:34:12.565 --> 00:34:14.745
Are you going through a difficult challenge right now?

633
00:34:14.845 --> 00:34:18.535
And are you complaining to God what's taken so long?

634
00:34:20.935 --> 00:34:23.995
Or are you praying patiently like Hannah?

635
00:34:24.215 --> 00:34:27.355
God, I just, I want to glorify you in all that I do.

636
00:34:27.585 --> 00:34:30.355
Help me to be patient while I wait for you.

637
00:34:33.455 --> 00:34:34.835
How are you doing? Obeying?

638
00:34:34.895 --> 00:34:37.075
Are you struggling like Saul

639
00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:38.955
and getting yourself into a bunch of trouble?

640
00:34:42.105 --> 00:34:43.525
Change, change today,

641
00:34:45.645 --> 00:34:47.365
rededicate your life to the Lord.

642
00:34:47.395 --> 00:34:48.805
Lord, I want to obey you.

643
00:34:49.085 --> 00:34:52.285
Whatever that is, I, I wanna take my hands off of my life

644
00:34:53.145 --> 00:34:55.245
and open them up and do whatever it is

645
00:34:55.425 --> 00:34:56.605
God you want me to do.

646
00:34:59.265 --> 00:35:02.805
And Lord, I want to chase hard after you, like David.

647
00:35:07.125 --> 00:35:08.465
Is that your prayer this morning?

648
00:35:13.295 --> 00:35:16.985
Lord, you are on the throne today, not us.

649
00:35:17.565 --> 00:35:18.905
You are on the throne today.

650
00:35:19.125 --> 00:35:23.345
You reign over all things, including our lives.

651
00:35:25.285 --> 00:35:28.465
We are in your hands. Do with us

652
00:35:28.765 --> 00:35:31.515
as you please Lord.

653
00:35:31.545 --> 00:35:33.635
It's our desire this morning to chase heart

654
00:35:33.635 --> 00:35:35.875
after you, to glorify you with everything we have,

655
00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:40.735
everything we have.

656
00:35:43.235 --> 00:35:45.335
You be our number one. You be our king.

657
00:35:47.555 --> 00:35:52.175
We love you Lord. Pray that you'll be pleased by the worship

658
00:35:53.035 --> 00:35:54.215
in these next few minutes.

659
00:35:55.245 --> 00:35:57.255
It's in Christ now we pray. Amen.

660
00:36:00.875 --> 00:36:02.815
And would you stand with us as we continue to.
