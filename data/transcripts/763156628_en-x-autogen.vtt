00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.600
Hmm testing one to all right. Sorry for

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.200
the delay. We've had a few technical difficulties this evening.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.600
I want you to see I'm going to be looking at some fantastic Graphics

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.700
that you will not be able to see.

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.400
But we're gonna talk first

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.600
about the pathway. We're not satisfied for

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.000
someone just to come to one section of the pie. Yes,

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
we want to worship together and we'll sing God's

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.700
word together and hear God's word preach pray together, but

10
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.600
we want to move that person from an experience where

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.600
they set silently into a relational environment

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.200
with their community group. Now every community

13
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.500
group is an open Group, which means you can come On Any Sunday and

14
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.700
feel welcome right away, but we're

15
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.300
not satisfied with a group large enough

16
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
to wear some people cannot speak from week to week

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.800
and no one knows that they haven't spoken. We would

18
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
love to get them into a an intentional relational

19
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.800
environment with a reproducible process so that

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.700
a leader can pour into them so that they they

21
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.400
go from largely silent with one person

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.800
having studied to now

23
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.400
the group together is thinking

24
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.100
about the same passage And discussing it as

25
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.200
And so that's the micro group now outside of that

26
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.800
micro group. We've not talked about this much.

27
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.600
But there is an opportunity to go one-on-one. Now,

28
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.200
the one-on-one is on a ask needed basis. You

29
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.100
don't need to meet weekly one-on-one. But

30
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.500
occasionally this has happened in the groups in the

31
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.600
small groups micro groups that I've discipled is that

32
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.400
somebody will say something in the course of a discussion

33
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.200
that you know needs to be followed up on but shouldn't

34
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.400
necessarily be followed up on in the

35
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.600
group.

36
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.300
Rusty I shared with you Rusty story

37
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.600
rusty said one time that he was really frustrated

38
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.300
in his marriage because when he got home she didn't seem

39
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.200
to be interested in him and he didn't think

40
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.600
that was right and he was going to just get busy playing golfers. I

41
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.300
don't know what he said but it wasn't in it wasn't the right answer

42
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.400
and I could have said Rusty that's not the

43
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.100
right answer, you know better than that, but that's that's not the kind

44
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.700
of relationship. We're going for in this option group on the

45
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.300
way to the car.

46
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.100
In the parking lot one-on-one. I said Rusty.

47
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.400
We need to get together this week. He goes. I know it.

48
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.400
You know.

49
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.400
any

50
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.300
we're gonna private conversation and he knew that at that

51
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.200
moment. I was going to encourage him and I was going to give him a little

52
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.300
homework assignment. It was going to be just he and I and sure

53
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.500
enough it. They were just fine.

54
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.200
He had just gotten into a rut and he needed

55
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.700
somebody to come alongside him and courage him. So that's the pathway. The

56
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.200
pathway is from a disconnected.

57
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200
members of the church

58
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.000
to relationally connected and then intimately

59
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.100
connected in A discipleship experience

60
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.800
where they're they're concerned

61
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.400
about one another and so

62
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.200
that's that's one thing we talked about what else that we

63
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.300
talked about. What is the disciples anybody know the definition of

64
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.900
disciple?

65
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.500
If I started you off.

66
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.400
One who is following?

67
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.300
Oh see I I made it intentionally easy.

68
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.400
Not all the answers are going to end with Jesus. Okay. So

69
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.300
yes one who is following

70
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.600
Jesus one? Who is do what?

71
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.600
Changed by Jesus so

72
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.500
Let me just share with you. This is the hard part about discipleship. Okay

73
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.400
care groups or Community groups.

74
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.600
We can kind of track your metrics through

75
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600
attendance. We know whether you're

76
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.500
attendance is holding steady growing or

77
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.900
falling. Okay, but in discipleship, we're

78
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.300
asking in a micro group. We're asking that

79
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.900
you cap your attendance at four.

80
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.800
You say well if somebody's comes we're down 25% or

81
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.600
doesn't come we're down 25% Yeah, that's not

82
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.200
we don't care about that. Right? What we care

83
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.100
about is transformed lives and it's really difficult to

84
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.700
attract the metrics of

85
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.500
a life that is changing. You know it

86
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.300
in your own heart when it's happening, you know,

87
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.400
when you've stepped away from the

88
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.500
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. I'm

89
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.200
in the spirit is always with you, but you can grieve the

90
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.500
Holy Spirit and this is a great story. You

91
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.200
can tell I'm not using notes how many of you have grieve the Holy Spirit at least

92
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.300
one time in your life. Okay today? Yeah. Okay hands up

93
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.200
and right you can grieve the Holy Spirit, but you

94
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.400
can also walk with the Holy Spirit be

95
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.800
filled with the Holy Spirit indwelt and empowered by

96
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.600
the Holy Spirit and that's what we're seeking to do in a

97
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.100
micro group is that we know in fact I can

98
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.400
take you back to my very first group and I

99
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.400
can look on the face of each one of those teenage.

100
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.100
Boys, and I can tell you who's walking with

101
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.000
the spirit or not just by the countenance on their face.

102
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.400
That's the truth. And I think you'll be able to experience

103
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.100
the exact same thing once you

104
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.300
Once you get involved in the micro group like that, so one who's following Jesus

105
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.200
one who's being changed by Jesus and one is committed to the mission of

106
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.000
Jesus and that's disciple making so let's

107
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.100
talk about tonight. Let's turn to page four.

108
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.700
Page four in your curriculum talks about casting the vision.

109
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.600
Now, we know that the vision statement

110
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.600
of our church is to love equip one

111
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.900
another to love Jesus and to live sense and

112
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.800
this pathway is taking us outside of

113
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.300
the building.

114
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.200
into a relational environment of your choosing

115
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.500
We're not going to tell you where to meet or when

116
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.000
to meet. I would encourage weekly some say

117
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.000
you can do it bi-weekly, but I would encourage weekly but

118
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.300
but we would like for you to do it off campus and then

119
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.700
one another's homes in the right coffee shop

120
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.300
or restaurant some coffee shops are very busy. And

121
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.700
so that's not a great relational environment some you know,

122
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.700
when how many of you guys remember when concrete polished

123
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.700
concrete got real popular.

124
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.300
Yeah, it's a horrible place to listen if everything

125
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.000
is hard like that, right? So anyway, so

126
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.700
you're looking to take your your mission

127
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.300
the disciple making mission on the

128
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.800
road you're living scent you're off campus, but

129
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.300
what's what's the

130
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.300
actual mission statement that we

131
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.500
want to become a hub before an

132
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.900
all ages disciple making movement. So we're actually

133
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.600
we talk about the casting the vision. This

134
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.500
is not the church's Vision. This is another Sunday

135
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.400
school answer look down over here because you guys got Jesus

136
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.200
so quickly while ago

137
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.600
Who is the church?

138
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.800
We are okay. Let me all said people and

139
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.500
because you were thinking about here's the church. Here's the

140
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.200
steeple open the doors and see.

141
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.500
All the people well now we are the church. I am

142
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.500
the church. This is not the church's Vision.

143
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.400
This is my vision. So that's what it means to cast

144
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.200
vision. And the first thing we have to do when

145
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.800
we're casting vision is resist the

146
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.000
temptation to repeat old patterns.

147
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.300
Let me just warn you that this is

148
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.200
a serious concern for me. Okay, because

149
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.400
I'm getting older and the older I get the harder

150
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.900
it is for me to change my my rhythm my patterns

151
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.100
last week Carol and

152
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.000
I went to California to be with granddaughters and

153
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.000
my daughter and her husband. We had a

154
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.900
great trip, but about three days in both. She and I were thinking.

155
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.400
Who?

156
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.300
I can't wait to get home, you know, but why

157
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.400
because we know where we're going to sleep when we're gonna go to bed when we're

158
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.400
going to get up how we're going to get up what's gonna happen when we get up that doesn't

159
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.300
happen at this new house with all these little

160
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.500
Tyrant granddaughters

161
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.200
They tell me when I get up and what I do when I get up

162
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.300
and they are gonna tell you when it's time to go to sleep and when you're not

163
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.700
going to be able to go to sleep and so I what happens

164
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.400
in a church. That's at least my age.

165
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.600
Is that we have patterns and one of the great patterns

166
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.400
of our church is a Bible studies

167
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.300
now Bible studies are important and we're

168
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.300
never going to get away from those.

169
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.100
The the scripture is replete with with commands

170
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.000
to study the scripture. And so that's fantastic.

171
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.700
But we're not talking about Bible studies

172
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.000
where one person prepares and the other

173
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.400
people respond to the questions that they've asked.

174
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.200
Okay, that's Bible study where there's one person preparing. Nobody

175
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.700
else has to even really come prepared.

176
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.100
I'm not going to have anybody raise hands. I don't get anybody

177
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.300
in trouble here. How many of you are CG leaders and

178
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.300
you think maybe you're the only one who studied

179
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.200
the passage that week?

180
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.300
Right happens every week, right? Okay. We had

181
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.500
I see that hand. I see that hand. But yeah, so but in

182
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.000
discipleship, we're gonna all be reading

183
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.700
the same passage during

184
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.600
the week. And then when we get together, we'll come

185
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.100
together as a community of people who realize that

186
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.100
it's not about attendance necessarily and it's not about

187
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.300
you having studied so that you can expound what you've learned

188
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.700
upon me. It's about us learning together and US

189
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.700
challenging one another to apply whatever truths

190
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.600
we've learned that week.

191
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.800
So that there's accountability in that.

192
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.800
But there's also Intimacy in that.

193
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.300
Not everybody likes intimacy. Amen.

194
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.900
Yeah, there's Intimacy in that.

195
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.000
Guy's my age. We

196
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.900
have not been huge fans of intimacy. But

197
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.900
what I want you to hear me say is that Jesus method

198
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.200
of disciple making this isn't on page three

199
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.200
doesn't work at a surface level.

200
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.200
It compels us to connect with people in a deeply

201
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.800
personal way. It's life on life up front

202
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.400
and in your face, it's motivated by love fueled

203
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.400
by the Holy Spirit and the end result is

204
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.900
dramatic transformation. That's what we're after Community is

205
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.200
where God does his best work. It's how he

206
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.400
created us before the fall. God said it's

207
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.600
not good that man be alone.

208
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.900
So we were created for community in his likeness the

209
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.300
word for God there is in the plural. That's

210
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.600
why when you read it in a in a good translation. It says let us

211
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.700
create man in our own image. So

212
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.600
the very trinitarian nature

213
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.500
of God as one who is one yet

214
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.100
in community.

215
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.700
is is that's how we were designed so

216
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.200
nobody flourishes when

217
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.400
they stand alone Nobody Breaks the power of sin

218
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.600
or experiences a Deeper Life With God when they stand alone.

219
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.000
You learn how Jesus Rescues us through genuine

220
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.100
discipleship relationships. I

221
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.700
saw tonight when

222
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.900
I was walking through the hallway after dinner. I

223
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.600
saw a couple of guys who by

224
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.300
virtue of their Ministry they spent a

225
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.200
lot of time together and I can tell by the way, they were looking at each other

226
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.000
and laughing with one another that these guys really care

227
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.800
for one another and it just just reminded

228
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.300
me what what I'm challenging each of us to begin to

229
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.300
do intentionally is when you become an

230
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.800
intentional leader, you are beginning to plan

231
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.600
for a relational environment with a potential disciple.

232
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.900
And so tonight we're gonna discuss in the next few minutes. How

233
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.200
do we have that conversation?

234
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.200
And we're gonna look at the writings of two different men. The writer

235
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.300
of our book is Craig Etheridge. And then

236
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.500
there's another writer named Greg Ogden and they've

237
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.700
both listed a step-by-step process for inviting

238
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.700
someone. The first one is pray.

239
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.200
on page two and Page 8 both

240
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.800
writers say your first step is pray. Ask

241
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.200
the Lord to place on your on your heart hungry people

242
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.600
to whom he's drawing you to

243
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.700
look for people that are faithful available and

244
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.900
teachable. So let's while you

245
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.600
guys are looking for that page. Let me just say this.

246
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.300
Don't expect the church to

247
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.400
put you in A discipleship relationship. Okay, if you

248
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.700
wait for me to call and say I found the perfect disciple for

249
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.400
you, you may never disciple anyone.

250
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.600
Okay, don't wait for that. Okay, that's happens every

251
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.800
Sunday and it's called Community groups. Right? But

252
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.200
what what we're doing is we're asking you to become

253
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.500
the intentional leader and to pray about who is God

254
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.000
leading me to invite to be

255
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.600
in A discipleship relationship and you're gonna be investing

256
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.900
your time your energy your your love

257
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.500
and care and connection with this person. So

258
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.700
it needs to be the right person pray who

259
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.300
that person is and then once you've selected that person

260
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.800
that God's leading you to

261
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.200
You approach them and ask if they would think about

262
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.100
maybe meeting together a couple of times and maybe with a

263
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.000
couple of others notice that first.

264
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.600
It's it's attainable. Let's just

265
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.800
get together for some coffee and just about everybody can do that. All

266
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.200
right, and but then you have the

267
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.200
conversation the conversation. Let me just let me

268
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.300
just say I believe this with everything in my

269
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:25.500
heart.

270
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.500
that if you agree to do this

271
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.800
You have alerted an adversary that hates

272
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.400
this decision.

273
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.200
And so if you're not careful about where you go

274
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.400
to have this conversation, then you're going to have it in the wrong spot

275
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.800
and it's not going to go. Well, you've prayed about it you believe that God

276
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.600
has led you to select this person. And then you you hit

277
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.300
them up in between the nine

278
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.300
and 10:30 services and there's

279
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.100
people coming this way and they got to pick their kids up at the at the

280
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.100
hillside kids and and they just

281
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.300
had a fight with their wife because their wife didn't

282
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.600
get certain things done. But threaten they thought they would and and so

283
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.200
they're gonna like no no. No, there's just no

284
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.400
time for that. So what you're gonna do is pick the right place

285
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.900
and you're gonna pick a good time. Typically the

286
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.000
best time is the time they suggest

287
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.200
You know, what's a good time for you?

288
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.100
Well, Tuesday's work good for me. Well, let's let's plan on getting together

289
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.400
Tuesday then and then you're gonna ask sincere questions and this

290
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:26.400
is

291
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.300
this is where this opposite begins to kind of become a

292
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.300
it's not a step-by-step process. It's a it's a skill.

293
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.300
It's an art. It's a relational feature of a real

294
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:39.800
relationship.

295
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.300
Say hey, you know what? I am.

296
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800
I'm curious about something.

297
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.800
And you kind of pick their interests say I want

298
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.300
to do something.

299
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.400
Where I get closer to the Lord.

300
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.900
And I've been praying that God would show me somebody is that

301
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.200
something would be interested in you would you be interested in

302
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.700
being in a in a group that wants to get closer to Lord? So how

303
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.100
are things going in your life right now?

304
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.400
Yeah, are you having a having regular time with the Lord alone?

305
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.500
Yeah, and these are serious sincere questions. I'm how's

306
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.400
that thing with your mom?

307
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.200
You know you guys are so good to ask me about my mom.

308
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.700
And by the way, I forgot to turn my phone on.

309
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.200
Okay, because she's gonna be calling, you know, she's gonna be calling here any

310
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:26.300
minute.

311
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:27.400
so

312
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.300
How's that thing? And it's it's a big deal in my

313
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.300
life. So you want to know how is that going? Well, you're gonna know the same

314
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.300
thing about the person you're asking could to disciples so ask sincere

315
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.400
questions. And then number this is

316
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.000
on page six make the ask.

317
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.500
Tell them that you've been praying and asking God how

318
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.300
you could get involved in our churches disciple making

319
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:49.600
mission.

320
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.200
You can say I went to this thing on Wednesday nights. It

321
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.800
was 12 weeks long. He talked about it. He wouldn't stop talking about it.

322
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.300
And then I don't know what I was thinking, but I raised my hand I said I was going to be a

323
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:00.900
disciple maker.

324
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.100
I was gonna be an intentional leader.

325
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.300
And then share your own story.

326
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.200
My story is this I was raised in a

327
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.200
Christian home and and I was a pretty good boy, but it

328
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.100
wasn't until my youth Minister came and said I

329
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.100
want you to pray about something. I want you to be in a group and we're gonna meet

330
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.200
every week and we're gonna memorize scripture together. We're gonna talk about the Bible together.

331
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.200
We're gonna learn how to have quiet times what we

332
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.500
used to call him back in a second. He's and would you

333
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.600
pray about it and I was in seventh grader.

334
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.300
No one had ever asked me to pray about anything.

335
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.300
And so now for the first time my faith is kind of becoming my

336
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:39.400
own.

337
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.900
I'm having to say.

338
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.100
Am I going to meet every week?

339
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:44.900
And I did.

340
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.500
And it literally changed the trajectory of

341
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.900
my life now so that let me think somewhere in

342
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.100
the neighborhood of 40.

343
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.400
To 50 years later. I'm still talking about discipleship.

344
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.700
Right, so it's important to get

345
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.700
to the place on your ask where you're clearly

346
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.700
stating what you're asking them to do. Tell them

347
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.000
what's involved is number five. It's on page nine remind them

348
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.500
that the micro group will be studying and reading

349
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.400
and working through content daily.

350
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.700
with two goals in mind

351
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.500
and these are the two goals. Remember transformation is

352
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.400
the ultimate goal goal. Number one, each disciple will

353
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.100
be learning the biblical content and responding to the group just a

354
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.300
minute just a minute ago. Eddie tabling

355
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.300
was telling me I've got an opportunity to Mentor a guy and I'm not quite sure what to

356
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.100
do. I said let me show you a thing on your phone that you can do or you guys can

357
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.500
read the same passage of scripture and you can both comment on it in real

358
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.300
time and you see one another's comments it goes man. That'll

359
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:43.600
be perfect.

360
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.300
So you get to decide that if that's what you want to do or

361
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.400
not, but but you're going to

362
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.400
Be engaging in biblical content and then responding to

363
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.300
the group and number two each disciple will be working at

364
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.500
establishing a daily habit of engaging in

365
00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.200
God's word.

366
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.100
we want

367
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.700
we want every believer.

368
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.500
to be in a individual relationship

369
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.100
with God through his word.

370
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.300
Let's think of a few passages.

371
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.600
Second Timothy 3:16 17 all scriptures given

372
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.300
by inspiration of God. It's breathed out by God

373
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.400
in his profitable for correction reproofing and instruction

374
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.100
in righteousness. So that the person the man of God

375
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.100
may be perfect and thoroughly furnished unto all good

376
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.100
works. So there's that transformation for you have to have a

377
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.800
relationship with God's word and it ought to happen daily. Okay.

378
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.600
What's another one?

379
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.900
Good Bible verse.

380
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.500
Josh 1:8

381
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.100
this book of the law will not departed thy mouth, but thou shall

382
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.800
meditate on it. They're in day and night and according.

383
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.500
That thou mayest observe to do whatsoever is written therein.

384
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.700
So that

385
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.300
Yes, so that your way shall be prosperous and

386
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.100
you shall have good success. There's that transformation period good.

387
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.100
I love a good KJV guy man. We're on

388
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.300
the same team. We're saying things that some of y'all have never heard before over here.

389
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.700
What are they saying? All right.

390
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.500
Now six is gonna be up to you is the

391
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.200
intentional leader. We are going to provide for you and

392
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.100
you can see it there in your handout. We're gonna

393
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.300
provide for you a covenant.

394
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.700
And some groups will start their very

395
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.300
first meeting by signing the Covenant in front

396
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.100
of one another and dating it. They get to keep their

397
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.500
own Covenant. You don't hand it into the church, you know

398
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.400
call the the elders when someone misses a

399
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.800
meeting. All right, it's them covenanting with

400
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.700
the group and with the Lord and with themselves

401
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.600
say, I'm gonna do this I'm gonna

402
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.700
take this seriously. They need to have a see a

403
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.200
clear sense of what's expected of them and number seven.

404
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.600
disciples need to prayerfully consider the invitation

405
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.500
I would recommend hard wholeheartedly to

406
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.500
say I don't want you to answer me right now. I want

407
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.300
you to think about this and pray about this.

408
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.500
I've been praying about it and God led me to you, but I want you to know that

409
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.000
this is what God's calling you to do.

410
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.400
All right, and we'll get together next week and we can decide

411
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.000
if it's something you want to do or not. Okay, ask him

412
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.800
to count the cost.

413
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.300
Which reminds me of a passage of scripture that Jesus said deny

414
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.400
yourself.

415
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.200
Pick up your cross and follow me. You count the cost

416
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.100
and then you give the answer that has been prayerfully discerned.

417
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.800
Is this what God wants?

418
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.500
I think we know the answer.

419
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.000
Okay.

420
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.700
And then lastly set the first regular meeting

421
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.800
and get started. This is on page 11.

422
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.700
Find a quiet place where you'll be able to grow in

423
00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.000
this intimate transparency as a group. I

424
00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.800
don't know where that place is. I

425
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.900
see groups meeting at the Panera all the time.

426
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.900
I'm not sure how in a minute it is since it's such

427
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.100
a busy place but find a place where you guys can

428
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.800
meet regularly and and have that meeting. I I've

429
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.200
been praying and I'm thinking that God wants me to

430
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.200
start a group out of Staff members.

431
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.200
And and some of our younger staff

432
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.200
members are their hard-working. They love the lord. They're on Mission with

433
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.500
the church, but I just love to have an

434
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.200
opportunity to pour into their lives. I don't I haven't asked

435
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.400
anybody yet. So don't tell them.

436
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.600
But I might ask them. All right. So on

437
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.200
your discussion sheet there

438
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.400
is three questions first one's

439
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.200
got two questions on it. So be five questions all together,

440
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.200
I think grab and

441
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.200
somebody to belong to your micro group. If you're by yourself try to

442
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.200
find one. That's smaller and Jump Right In

443
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.500
and before you leave tonight began

444
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.400
praying about our who is it that

445
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.300
God's gonna ask me to to be in my first

446
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.800
Micro group. All right, let's pray father. Thank

447
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.200
you for these folks. I thank you Lord for their willingness to

448
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.200
to come and to be a part

449
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.000
of something bigger than themselves Lord. We do want to

450
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.300
become a church that does more than just talks about this authorship.

451
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.300
We want to be disciple makers.

452
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.200
We want to come next year and have stories that we can tell

453
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.200
of lives that were changed and marriages that were saved and

454
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.100
and Lord we want to we want

455
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.200
to be able to boast on you and your power to change our

456
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.200
hearts and lives Lord. I pray father that.

457
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.400
And we would be able to discern what our old

458
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.700
patterns causing us not to want to be able to do this and

459
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.900
that Lord you would give us the wisdom know how to how to

460
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.400
how to not repeat those old patterns, but get involved

461
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.200
in what you're calling us to do is disciple makers and it's

462
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.400
in Jesus name. I pray amen.
