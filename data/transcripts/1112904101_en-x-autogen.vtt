00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:05.235
Good morning church.

2
00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:06.875
It is a great day,

3
00:00:06.935 --> 00:00:09.595
and we get to start with one of the best things that we do

4
00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:12.435
as a church is watch and participate

5
00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.875
and encourage those who are being baptized

6
00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:17.555
because they have already proclaimed their faith in Jesus.

7
00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:18.995
They want to tell you the same thing.

8
00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:21.515
So this is my friend, Kinzie foci,

9
00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:25.235
and she is here to, uh, declare

10
00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:27.395
that she has talked to us about things.

11
00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.235
She's already talked to her parents, all of that.

12
00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:32.875
But what she's told us is that Jesus is her Lord and Savior,

13
00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:34.635
and she trusts him with her eternity.

14
00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:36.595
So we're super thankful to do that.

15
00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:41.515
Yeah, super thankful to get to celebrate

16
00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:45.795
that today as she declares that with this illustration of

17
00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:49.355
what happens inside our hearts by being baptized.

18
00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:52.995
And so Kenzie, based on your profession of faith, I get

19
00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:54.795
to baptize you in the name of the Father,

20
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.195
son, and Holy Spirit.

21
00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:05.275
That's Right. Lord, thank you so much

22
00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:07.955
for this illustration of what it means to,

23
00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:09.675
to be dead spiritually

24
00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:12.795
and then to be raised to life spiritually, forever,

25
00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:16.555
and ever to be with you and to know you and to love you.

26
00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:19.315
God, what a gift of grace that that is,

27
00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:20.555
that she didn't work for this.

28
00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:23.475
She didn't earn it, but you reached into her life

29
00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:25.595
and brought her to life spiritually.

30
00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:29.595
We pray for her as she follows you every day, that

31
00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:31.955
as those ups and downs come, she leans in.

32
00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.555
Trust you that we as a church come alongside her

33
00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:38.115
and her parents to help her follow you more

34
00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:39.355
closely every day.

35
00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:42.315
Lord, thank you for the day. We get to celebrate that here.

36
00:01:42.545 --> 00:01:44.875
Looking forward to the day we celebrate your return.

37
00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:47.115
In Jesus name, amen.

38
00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:51.515
Amen. It's so good to see.
