00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:03.625
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.825
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:09.545
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.905
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:17.105
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:25.145
Well, good morning everyone.

7
00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.265
My name is John, one of the pastors here.

8
00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:28.905
If you are new to our church, we're

9
00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:30.225
so grateful you would take a step

10
00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:31.985
and uh, be here with us today.

11
00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.065
Uh, but also if you call Henderson Hills home,

12
00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.505
it's always great to see you as well.

13
00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.305
We love being together like this. Okay?

14
00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:43.585
So raise your hand if you want to be blessed by God.

15
00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:48.625
Okay? Never hand if you didn't raise your hand.

16
00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:49.785
I got some questions for you

17
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:51.345
so we can talk later about that.

18
00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:53.625
But, uh, but I wonder something though, if we took

19
00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:54.625
that a step further

20
00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:58.145
and we ask the question, okay, yeah, you raised your hand,

21
00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.265
but, but why do you want God's bless?

22
00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:05.385
We probably get a wider variety of answers.

23
00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:09.105
Somebody might say, well, it it to make me happy

24
00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.185
or to enjoy my life more,

25
00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:13.865
or to make things go well for my family.

26
00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:16.425
And I, I think if, if we even took it a step further

27
00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:17.905
and we injected truth serum

28
00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:20.345
and we had to be really brutally honest,

29
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.145
what we might see is

30
00:01:22.145 --> 00:01:23.745
that some would say we want God's

31
00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:25.865
blessing so that we're rich.

32
00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:29.225
We want God's blessing so that

33
00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:31.465
we're healthy perfectly all the time,

34
00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:33.145
or that we have a, a prominent job

35
00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:34.825
that everybody looks up to.

36
00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:40.665
The problem is that all of those reasons are inadequate

37
00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:44.825
for why we should seek God's blessings.

38
00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:48.185
That's the direction that Psalm 67 is

39
00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:49.345
going to lead us to today.

40
00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:51.185
And so if you're not there already, turn

41
00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:52.665
with me to God's word.

42
00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:57.025
Psalm 67, roughly in the middle, you open it up,

43
00:01:57.025 --> 00:01:58.545
you'll probably hit Psalms there.

44
00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:02.825
Continuing our years long journey through the Psalms,

45
00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:05.225
just one by one kind of summers hit

46
00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.625
and miss throughout the year as well.

47
00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:10.385
Now this psalm we're gonna look at today is very short.

48
00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:12.145
It's only seven verses long,

49
00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:18.185
but it's very important the Jews would often read it at the

50
00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:19.265
end of every Sabbath.

51
00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:22.465
In fact, in the early 18 hundreds, the Church

52
00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:24.425
of England said that this psalm should be read at

53
00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:25.505
every worship gathering.

54
00:02:27.805 --> 00:02:31.825
It also reflects the blessing that the priests were

55
00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:34.345
to pronounce, say,

56
00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:38.745
over God's people every time they gathered numbers.

57
00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:41.665
Chapter six verses 24 through 26.

58
00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:43.265
This is what the priests were to say,

59
00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:44.745
that the Lord bless you

60
00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:48.905
and keep you, the Lord make his face shine upon you

61
00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:50.145
and be gracious to you.

62
00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:54.465
The Lord lift up his countenance, his face upon you

63
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:56.105
and give you peace.

64
00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.945
That's what God told the priest to say

65
00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.205
to the people every time.

66
00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:08.165
But again, though, Psalm 67 will show us why we are

67
00:03:08.185 --> 00:03:09.805
to seek God's blessing,

68
00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.965
which again may be a little different than we might have

69
00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:14.405
thought originally.

70
00:03:15.505 --> 00:03:16.765
So look at Psalm 67.

71
00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:18.365
I'm gonna read the whole thing to begin with

72
00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:21.525
to the choir master with stringed

73
00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:22.645
instruments, a psalm, a song.

74
00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:24.645
Remember these were, these were supposed to be read

75
00:03:24.665 --> 00:03:26.085
and sung at times.

76
00:03:26.115 --> 00:03:30.925
This one especially may God be gracious to us

77
00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:34.605
and bless us and make his face to shine upon us.

78
00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:36.245
Sounds familiar, right?

79
00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:41.365
Sayah that your way may be known on earth, your saving power

80
00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:42.485
among all nations.

81
00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:45.165
Let the peoples praise you, oh God,

82
00:03:45.665 --> 00:03:47.285
let all the peoples praise you.

83
00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:51.845
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy for you.

84
00:03:51.845 --> 00:03:53.205
Judge the peoples with equity

85
00:03:53.205 --> 00:03:55.525
and guide the nations upon earth.

86
00:03:56.655 --> 00:03:59.485
Sayah, let the peoples praise you.

87
00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.645
Oh God, let all the peoples praise you.

88
00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:04.325
The earth has yielded its increase.

89
00:04:04.585 --> 00:04:08.725
God, our God shall bless us, God shall bless us.

90
00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:11.405
Let all the ends of the earth fear him.

91
00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:17.965
God, thank you for your word this psalm,

92
00:04:17.965 --> 00:04:19.925
that's one of my favorites.

93
00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:23.645
So deeply felt in my soul. Thank you God for this word.

94
00:04:23.665 --> 00:04:26.285
And I pray that you would make our hearts today, every one

95
00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:31.125
of us good soil that this word would plant in

96
00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:32.565
that heart soil

97
00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:36.925
and it would bear fruit 30 fold, 60 fold, a hundred fold.

98
00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:40.005
Give us eyes to see it.

99
00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:44.285
Give us ears to hear it and a willingness to receive it

100
00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:46.645
and to act on it in your spirit's power.

101
00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:51.525
Help us God for your glory. In Jesus' name. Amen.

102
00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.765
So we, we can take this on its own,

103
00:04:55.765 --> 00:04:58.565
but if we were to trace this psalm, the roots

104
00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:02.325
of it all the way back, we would find that it's founded,

105
00:05:02.515 --> 00:05:06.485
it's rooted in God's covenant promise to Father Abraham

106
00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:10.365
who had many sons, many sons had.

107
00:05:10.365 --> 00:05:11.405
Wait, okay, I'm not gonna keep going

108
00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:12.605
because that's gonna get in your head, right?

109
00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:15.525
So sorry about that already. I've had that in my all week.

110
00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:17.605
So, uh, but

111
00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:21.125
but seriously all the way back in Genesis chapter 12 verses

112
00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:24.565
one through three, listen to what God says to Abraham.

113
00:05:24.665 --> 00:05:28.245
The Lord said to Abraham, Abraham, go from your country

114
00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:29.485
and your kindred

115
00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:32.365
and your father's house to the land that I will show you

116
00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:35.245
and I will make of you a great nation.

117
00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:37.085
And I will bless you

118
00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:40.765
and make your name great so that you will be a blessing.

119
00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:43.845
I'll bless those who bless you, him who dishonors you.

120
00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:46.765
I will curse. And in you all the families

121
00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:49.045
of the earth shall be blessed.

122
00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:54.485
So this sets the agenda for Abraham's life,

123
00:05:54.945 --> 00:05:58.445
but it also sets the agenda for his descendants, right?

124
00:05:58.445 --> 00:06:01.445
This was the Abrahamic covenant that God made

125
00:06:01.655 --> 00:06:03.565
where this set the tone

126
00:06:03.565 --> 00:06:06.685
because this man who at the time was not a worshiper

127
00:06:06.685 --> 00:06:10.805
of Yahweh, God called him and set him apart.

128
00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:14.725
This man who was at the time childless with his wife

129
00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:18.445
and they were both too old to have children.

130
00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:24.205
God says, I'm gonna make you a large nation by

131
00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:26.885
that meaning you're gonna have a huge family.

132
00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:29.245
And so that, that's our first point.

133
00:06:29.245 --> 00:06:32.205
Before we get too far into this, in relation to Psalm 67,

134
00:06:32.265 --> 00:06:34.725
the first point is that Abraham was blessed by God.

135
00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:38.165
Like we don't just take Psalm 67 on its own.

136
00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:43.045
We have to remember this was God's blessing of Abraham.

137
00:06:44.385 --> 00:06:47.965
And you saw it in Genesis 12. God said, I will bless you.

138
00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:52.045
Not I might, I will,

139
00:06:52.065 --> 00:06:55.925
but did you notice why God was gonna bless Abraham

140
00:06:58.105 --> 00:07:00.885
so that you will be a blessing?

141
00:07:02.035 --> 00:07:03.125
That was Genesis 12.

142
00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:08.525
I will bless you so that you will be a blessing so

143
00:07:08.525 --> 00:07:12.565
that in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.

144
00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:15.805
That was the end of verse three, that God blessed Abraham

145
00:07:16.545 --> 00:07:18.605
to be a blessing to others.

146
00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:23.485
That word for families at the end of verse three,

147
00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:26.485
it means people, groups, distinct cultures.

148
00:07:27.505 --> 00:07:29.325
You see it repeated throughout the Old Testament,

149
00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:32.205
even in the New Testament, kinda the gentile idea of

150
00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:34.805
of family groups clans

151
00:07:37.275 --> 00:07:40.765
that in Abraham, through Abraham, God was going

152
00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:43.165
to bless all the families.

153
00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:46.325
And so that means yes, materially,

154
00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.565
financially God was gonna bless Abraham to bless others.

155
00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:51.405
But first

156
00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:54.445
and foremost what we trace the lineage of the Bible,

157
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:58.925
the the scarlet thread throughout is that this blessing

158
00:07:59.825 --> 00:08:02.485
of the families of the earth was gonna come

159
00:08:02.485 --> 00:08:04.605
through Abraham's family lineage.

160
00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:08.005
That you track it all the way through

161
00:08:08.065 --> 00:08:10.805
and eventually you see the Messiah, Jesus,

162
00:08:12.565 --> 00:08:17.225
a descendant of Abraham in you, all the families

163
00:08:17.445 --> 00:08:19.385
of the earth would be blessed.

164
00:08:19.445 --> 00:08:23.385
So again, notice God didn't give Abraham all

165
00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:25.505
that he gave him materially

166
00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:27.105
financially, yes, all those things.

167
00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:29.225
But even a family, Isaac

168
00:08:29.485 --> 00:08:33.465
and the lineage like he, God didn't give him that merely

169
00:08:33.485 --> 00:08:37.585
for Abraham alone, that his blessing came on Abraham.

170
00:08:37.605 --> 00:08:39.345
So that Abraham could have all the things that he wanted.

171
00:08:39.365 --> 00:08:43.545
Is that why? No. He was blessed to be a blessing to others,

172
00:08:45.355 --> 00:08:49.505
which is what his faith in God brought about as we track it

173
00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:51.265
through the Bible.

174
00:08:53.045 --> 00:08:56.485
That's what forms the backdrop for Psalm 67.

175
00:08:58.415 --> 00:09:00.035
And in verse one, we've already seen the

176
00:09:00.035 --> 00:09:01.315
callback to the blessing.

177
00:09:01.315 --> 00:09:04.635
The priests were to give, in Psalm 67, they call back

178
00:09:04.635 --> 00:09:06.875
to number six, God be gracious to us.

179
00:09:08.575 --> 00:09:11.715
God shine your face upon us. God bless us.

180
00:09:12.255 --> 00:09:14.995
Number six, that blessing was a reminder

181
00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:18.075
of Abraham receiving that promise from God.

182
00:09:18.305 --> 00:09:19.635
They were to bless the people.

183
00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:21.715
Now, Psalm 67 picks it up

184
00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:25.725
and says, Israel, hey Israel, you were

185
00:09:25.725 --> 00:09:26.925
to seek God's blessing too.

186
00:09:28.555 --> 00:09:29.925
Abraham was blessed by God.

187
00:09:30.265 --> 00:09:33.845
Israel, throughout your history seek God's blessing.

188
00:09:35.465 --> 00:09:38.765
You are to seek his blessing. 'cause this is a request here.

189
00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:43.565
This is a prayer saying, God, we ask you to bless us God.

190
00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:45.805
God shine your face upon us.

191
00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:51.205
Even that little word sayah, we kind

192
00:09:51.365 --> 00:09:52.805
of skate over that really fast.

193
00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:56.125
It's a Hebrew where they indicated some kind of a pause,

194
00:09:56.525 --> 00:09:58.045
a musical interlude maybe.

195
00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:01.045
But notice where it sits here right

196
00:10:01.045 --> 00:10:05.765
after verse one, it says, you need to pause and consider

197
00:10:05.865 --> 00:10:10.615
and think about what just was said in verse one, just

198
00:10:10.615 --> 00:10:13.295
to sit on that request for God's blessing.

199
00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:16.695
Stop for a moment and consider

200
00:10:18.725 --> 00:10:21.495
that you're asking the God of the universe to bless you.

201
00:10:21.795 --> 00:10:26.595
Wow. But what we come

202
00:10:26.595 --> 00:10:31.075
to find out throughout this short Psalm is

203
00:10:31.075 --> 00:10:32.235
that their reason

204
00:10:32.335 --> 00:10:35.155
to seek God's blessing was the same as Abraham's.

205
00:10:38.155 --> 00:10:39.285
It's throughout the Psalm,

206
00:10:39.285 --> 00:10:41.485
especially though seen in the structure.

207
00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:43.965
And this is where you have to read carefully.

208
00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:45.365
And this is something that I wanted just

209
00:10:45.365 --> 00:10:46.605
to show you a little bit,

210
00:10:46.605 --> 00:10:48.885
because remember these psalms are poetry.

211
00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:53.365
Doesn't mean they follow logical flow very often.

212
00:10:54.235 --> 00:10:56.125
Like you read the New Testament, Paul's writing a letter,

213
00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:58.725
he's making an argument, he's tracing something.

214
00:10:59.865 --> 00:11:01.125
The Psalms don't work like that.

215
00:11:02.075 --> 00:11:05.965
They're poetry, which means that you can

216
00:11:06.735 --> 00:11:08.445
often find patterns.

217
00:11:09.945 --> 00:11:13.365
And one tool to find a pattern is called chiasm.

218
00:11:14.685 --> 00:11:16.365
C-H-I-A-S-M.

219
00:11:16.705 --> 00:11:19.885
Chiasm is where the, the first verses parallel the last

220
00:11:20.025 --> 00:11:22.485
verses, and then the next set

221
00:11:22.485 --> 00:11:23.965
of verses you come up from the bottom

222
00:11:24.065 --> 00:11:27.365
and those parallel each other and then so on and so forth.

223
00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:28.965
You come in both ways

224
00:11:29.025 --> 00:11:31.965
and they parallel each other all leading to finally

225
00:11:32.905 --> 00:11:36.365
the middle is what the author was emphasizing.

226
00:11:37.265 --> 00:11:38.485
And you wouldn't pick that up normally,

227
00:11:38.485 --> 00:11:41.125
but you have to read it carefully and look at it.

228
00:11:41.385 --> 00:11:43.925
And so I was trying to think of a way to illustrate this.

229
00:11:43.955 --> 00:11:46.325
Well, think of like the beak of a puffin.

230
00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:49.325
So when you look at that, by the

231
00:11:49.325 --> 00:11:50.365
way, those are not penguins.

232
00:11:50.365 --> 00:11:52.085
I, I thought that my whole life, like those are part

233
00:11:52.085 --> 00:11:54.485
penguin, but they're not, they're birds.

234
00:11:54.585 --> 00:11:57.285
So, uh, but but you see the, the beak, right?

235
00:11:58.425 --> 00:12:00.845
The top and bottom, it looks like a almost a greater than

236
00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:04.205
sign where it comes down and in to the point.

237
00:12:05.265 --> 00:12:08.285
So the directions of both are heading towards the

238
00:12:08.285 --> 00:12:10.605
middle to the point.

239
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.805
That's what's happening here in Psalm 67.

240
00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:14.765
So the rest of your life, when you see a puffin, you think

241
00:12:14.765 --> 00:12:16.125
of Psalm 67, okay?

242
00:12:18.545 --> 00:12:20.685
But it has a really clear castic structure.

243
00:12:20.705 --> 00:12:22.805
And so I'm gonna show you on the screen here that

244
00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:26.525
that verses one and two are parallel to verses six

245
00:12:26.585 --> 00:12:27.645
and seven, the end

246
00:12:27.875 --> 00:12:31.205
because it's opening with a prayer for God to bless them.

247
00:12:31.465 --> 00:12:32.965
And what does it end with? It ends

248
00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:35.925
with probably a future prophetic fulfillment of

249
00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:37.045
that same blessing.

250
00:12:37.045 --> 00:12:38.325
Those go together.

251
00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:41.205
But then you see, notice, this is where it's really clear.

252
00:12:41.205 --> 00:12:43.405
Verse three and verse five, you come up

253
00:12:43.425 --> 00:12:45.005
and to the right a little bit

254
00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:47.245
because those are identical verses, right?

255
00:12:48.095 --> 00:12:51.085
Verse three and verse five are exactly the same

256
00:12:51.085 --> 00:12:53.165
where they're saying, God,

257
00:12:53.225 --> 00:12:54.845
we want all peoples to praise you.

258
00:12:57.175 --> 00:13:01.795
What'd that leave us with? Verse four, right?

259
00:13:01.905 --> 00:13:04.635
It's pointing to the the point verse four

260
00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:07.795
where it says this middle of the sandwich,

261
00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:10.195
you might say the hinge, the point of the whole thing.

262
00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:13.395
What does it say? It's a prayer for the gladness

263
00:13:13.455 --> 00:13:18.035
of the nations in God as they submit

264
00:13:18.335 --> 00:13:21.915
to his righteous rule, his sovereign guidance.

265
00:13:22.055 --> 00:13:25.475
That's what the author wanted to emphasize.

266
00:13:29.085 --> 00:13:30.825
Now we'll get to the nations in a moment,

267
00:13:32.485 --> 00:13:35.225
but if that was to be true of all the nations,

268
00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:40.705
Then it certainly was to be true of Israel as well, right?

269
00:13:40.735 --> 00:13:45.385
Like if it's God, we, we want let all the nations be glad.

270
00:13:46.965 --> 00:13:49.625
We should be glad in you as well.

271
00:13:49.645 --> 00:13:53.545
And so just taking it first at surface level here,

272
00:13:54.965 --> 00:13:59.425
Israel was to seek God's blessing for their own gladness.

273
00:13:59.915 --> 00:14:04.905
First, like to seek the blessing of God

274
00:14:05.005 --> 00:14:07.105
for their own gladness.

275
00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:12.265
Verse one, they were to ask God to bless them,

276
00:14:12.605 --> 00:14:17.145
to be gracious to them, to make his face shine upon them.

277
00:14:17.145 --> 00:14:20.825
Which is just a symbolic way of saying that God was smiling

278
00:14:21.575 --> 00:14:24.505
over them, that God's favor

279
00:14:25.245 --> 00:14:26.585
was resting on them.

280
00:14:27.725 --> 00:14:32.545
God, we want you to smile when you look at us, want you

281
00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:34.225
to look with pleasure.

282
00:14:36.925 --> 00:14:38.505
And so what we see is at least

283
00:14:39.325 --> 00:14:42.825
and the very least, those blessings of God were to

284
00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:45.785
increase Israel's enjoyment of God.

285
00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:50.225
That they were glad in him as their king,

286
00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:51.685
that they were overjoyed,

287
00:14:51.685 --> 00:14:54.605
that this God would look at them with favor.

288
00:14:58.085 --> 00:15:01.825
God had set Israel apart to be his,

289
00:15:02.925 --> 00:15:06.705
to be his cherished possession, to be his very own people

290
00:15:07.845 --> 00:15:08.865
out of all the nations.

291
00:15:08.885 --> 00:15:09.865
Not because they deserved it

292
00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:10.985
or because they were the biggest.

293
00:15:11.405 --> 00:15:14.705
He just chose to take them as his

294
00:15:18.155 --> 00:15:19.285
That should fill them.

295
00:15:19.825 --> 00:15:23.005
And they should sing with this joy.

296
00:15:24.385 --> 00:15:28.525
That's what Psalm 67 is saying to them First,

297
00:15:28.825 --> 00:15:30.805
you should be glad in him.

298
00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:35.765
But what we again see here is

299
00:15:35.765 --> 00:15:39.205
that God was blessing them so

300
00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:41.325
that they would be a blessing to the nations.

301
00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:47.225
So that the nations would be glad as well.

302
00:15:49.505 --> 00:15:52.925
Israel seek God's blessing so that you are glad in God.

303
00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:56.245
And so that the nations are glad in God.

304
00:15:58.905 --> 00:16:00.375
Again, that that's verse four, right?

305
00:16:00.395 --> 00:16:02.495
The meat of the sandwich. Remember the the

306
00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:03.655
very middle point of it.

307
00:16:04.035 --> 00:16:05.415
Let the nations be glad

308
00:16:05.605 --> 00:16:07.895
that was the first line of verse four.

309
00:16:08.995 --> 00:16:10.975
Let the nations be glad.

310
00:16:10.995 --> 00:16:14.415
In other words, God was blessing Israel so

311
00:16:14.415 --> 00:16:16.935
that he would be known among the nations.

312
00:16:19.035 --> 00:16:23.365
They were to publicly live out a response to his

313
00:16:23.925 --> 00:16:27.125
guidance, to his salvation, to his good way

314
00:16:27.315 --> 00:16:29.925
that he told them how to live to his saving power,

315
00:16:30.145 --> 00:16:33.325
to his judgment that saved them all of that they were

316
00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:35.205
to live out such a way

317
00:16:35.585 --> 00:16:39.805
and be so compelled by their own gladness in him

318
00:16:41.395 --> 00:16:43.965
that they wanted all peoples to be glad in him as well.

319
00:16:45.475 --> 00:16:50.085
Like so transformed by this grace of God

320
00:16:51.525 --> 00:16:53.505
To say we want all the nations to know him.

321
00:16:56.605 --> 00:16:58.095
That was what we saw for Abraham.

322
00:16:58.455 --> 00:16:59.535
Remember back in Genesis 12,

323
00:17:01.745 --> 00:17:04.205
and it was the theme that Isaiah picked up

324
00:17:06.505 --> 00:17:08.445
Isaiah 49 verse six.

325
00:17:09.065 --> 00:17:10.925
God says, it's too light a thing

326
00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:13.845
that you should be my servant to raise up merely the tribes

327
00:17:13.845 --> 00:17:16.085
of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel.

328
00:17:16.725 --> 00:17:19.485
I will make you a light to the nations

329
00:17:21.155 --> 00:17:24.885
that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.

330
00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:29.445
So what this means is

331
00:17:29.445 --> 00:17:32.005
that God would give Israel the most joy

332
00:17:33.425 --> 00:17:36.405
and he would shine the brightest like that through them

333
00:17:37.585 --> 00:17:41.285
as they kept a global perspective on his blessings to them

334
00:17:42.825 --> 00:17:46.805
as they saw it from God's perspective, as they expanded

335
00:17:47.355 --> 00:17:50.085
this joy that they'd been given to others.

336
00:17:53.785 --> 00:17:55.725
You can probably see where this is setting, can't you

337
00:18:00.425 --> 00:18:01.605
as God's people today,

338
00:18:03.575 --> 00:18:04.845
These Truths are still the same.

339
00:18:07.865 --> 00:18:09.685
We are to seek God's blessing too.

340
00:18:11.235 --> 00:18:12.605
Abraham was blessed by God.

341
00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:14.245
Israel was to seek God's blessing.

342
00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:17.405
We are to seek God's blessing also.

343
00:18:20.345 --> 00:18:23.805
But again, not for selfish reasons.

344
00:18:26.325 --> 00:18:29.805
'cause listen to how James four three says it very clearly.

345
00:18:30.065 --> 00:18:32.125
You ask and do not receive

346
00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:36.925
because you ask wrongly to spend it on your passions.

347
00:18:39.195 --> 00:18:41.365
He's saying God's not blessing you

348
00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:43.485
because you're just merely asking.

349
00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:45.285
So you can spend it on yourself.

350
00:18:46.505 --> 00:18:47.925
So you can use it for yourself.

351
00:18:49.335 --> 00:18:50.725
God's not gonna give you anything for that.

352
00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:53.585
He knows that's harmful for you.

353
00:18:53.585 --> 00:18:54.905
And so he is not gonna give it but it.

354
00:18:55.285 --> 00:18:58.185
But there's a difference what we're asking for here.

355
00:18:58.195 --> 00:19:00.065
We're not merely to ask for God's blessings,

356
00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:02.665
for our own comforts, to make our lives easier,

357
00:19:03.565 --> 00:19:06.105
to one up the next guy because look how much we have.

358
00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:08.465
And you don't. That's not it.

359
00:19:08.525 --> 00:19:11.505
The reasons are still the same today as they were back then.

360
00:19:14.645 --> 00:19:17.615
Just like for Israel, they were to seek God's blessings

361
00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.575
to increase their gladness in God first

362
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:21.935
and then the gladness of the nations through them.

363
00:19:22.165 --> 00:19:25.255
It's the same. We are to seek God's blessings first so

364
00:19:25.255 --> 00:19:26.735
that we can love him more deeply.

365
00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:34.755
God, we want you to bless us so we can love you more deeply.

366
00:19:36.345 --> 00:19:37.435
Like he's a good father.

367
00:19:39.815 --> 00:19:44.755
And so we should long for him verse one, to smile on us,

368
00:19:45.335 --> 00:19:48.635
to be gracious to us, to bless us so

369
00:19:48.635 --> 00:19:52.595
that we can know him more so that we can love him more and

370
00:19:52.595 --> 00:19:56.595
and the more we love him, then the more abundant praise

371
00:19:56.625 --> 00:19:58.635
that we saw in Psalm 67, the more

372
00:19:58.635 --> 00:20:01.675
that abundant praise just pours out of our lives, out

373
00:20:01.675 --> 00:20:05.595
of our mouths, the more we love him.

374
00:20:07.675 --> 00:20:09.715
I mean, just think about it. We talk about

375
00:20:09.715 --> 00:20:10.755
what we love, right?

376
00:20:11.945 --> 00:20:15.755
Like, like when you have grandkids, you're more than happy

377
00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:17.555
to post pictures on Facebook about him,

378
00:20:17.575 --> 00:20:19.515
to show anybody who asks.

379
00:20:19.515 --> 00:20:22.555
Like you're at some random restaurant meeting a stranger

380
00:20:22.575 --> 00:20:23.995
and you're like, Hey, you wanna see my grandkids?

381
00:20:23.995 --> 00:20:26.715
Like that's how you do it, right? Because you love 'em.

382
00:20:28.705 --> 00:20:29.995
It's not just that though, right?

383
00:20:31.295 --> 00:20:33.515
The newest gadget you purchased, you got the new iPhone,

384
00:20:33.515 --> 00:20:35.075
you got the new gadget at the house,

385
00:20:35.135 --> 00:20:36.275
the new system, whatever it is.

386
00:20:36.275 --> 00:20:38.075
Like you, you love talking about that.

387
00:20:38.175 --> 00:20:40.755
You love talking about your favorite team and how well

388
00:20:40.775 --> 00:20:42.195
or how poorly they're doing.

389
00:20:42.495 --> 00:20:45.915
And you can see how that just comes out of you naturally.

390
00:20:48.065 --> 00:20:50.085
Or you're at the Grand Canyon, you see that sunset

391
00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:53.045
and you wanna take 5,000 pictures of it

392
00:20:53.045 --> 00:20:55.205
because you want everybody to know how great it was.

393
00:21:00.535 --> 00:21:05.115
So I'm afraid that, I'm afraid we don't praise

394
00:21:05.455 --> 00:21:07.075
God like that.

395
00:21:09.325 --> 00:21:11.065
Partly because we don't love him that much.

396
00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:17.325
We're not glad. We're not thrilled.

397
00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:22.965
And so we sit stone faced when the gospel is proclaimed.

398
00:21:25.525 --> 00:21:27.545
We, we sit there with our hands in our pockets

399
00:21:27.545 --> 00:21:30.905
and don't sing at all because we just don't care that much.

400
00:21:36.815 --> 00:21:38.115
And I'm not saying that to you.

401
00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:39.915
I'm saying that to myself even this week.

402
00:21:40.075 --> 00:21:42.875
I mean, I, I had to ask the question,

403
00:21:44.535 --> 00:21:46.635
am I really that glad in God?

404
00:21:49.425 --> 00:21:51.435
Like is, is it is just something that it's like,

405
00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:53.875
is my gladness in him really increasing

406
00:21:57.585 --> 00:22:02.285
or am I more glad in all kinds of other things instead

407
00:22:02.285 --> 00:22:04.165
of him than I get to read my Bible for five minutes,

408
00:22:04.165 --> 00:22:05.565
but then I get to go watch that show?

409
00:22:05.635 --> 00:22:05.925
Like

410
00:22:11.225 --> 00:22:14.965
am I allowing my heart to be stolen away to lesser gods

411
00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:19.915
that his word even says will never satisfy?

412
00:22:24.425 --> 00:22:28.355
Like how can you and I say to the nations, be glad in God

413
00:22:29.095 --> 00:22:33.875
if we're not even that glad in God, If he doesn't

414
00:22:34.855 --> 00:22:37.155
excite, awaken, move us.

415
00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.905
Okay? So how do we grow in this?

416
00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:47.065
Like I, we're all sitting here kind of pressed down

417
00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:48.185
by God's word here, okay?

418
00:22:48.185 --> 00:22:49.905
So how do we grow in this area?

419
00:22:51.935 --> 00:22:55.305
Well, we look to God's word here in Psalm 67

420
00:22:56.485 --> 00:23:00.985
and we begin to recall who God is, what God has done.

421
00:23:01.045 --> 00:23:02.785
And we think first as this says,

422
00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:05.945
we think first about his sovereign guidance in our lives,

423
00:23:08.525 --> 00:23:11.745
his good way that he has worked in us and how he's led us.

424
00:23:14.205 --> 00:23:15.985
And I know we might not always understand

425
00:23:15.985 --> 00:23:19.465
what he's doing in the moment, but we can't help

426
00:23:19.845 --> 00:23:23.145
but praise when we see the resulting

427
00:23:23.545 --> 00:23:24.825
blessings of what he's done.

428
00:23:26.785 --> 00:23:30.225
I mean, just think of Abraham. God said to him,

429
00:23:30.795 --> 00:23:33.265
leave your house, your family, your land.

430
00:23:33.925 --> 00:23:37.745
Go. He's like, okay, where am I going? I'll show you.

431
00:23:39.695 --> 00:23:42.025
Like, do I need to go east or what?

432
00:23:42.495 --> 00:23:45.485
I'll show you when you get there, I'll show you.

433
00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:48.285
And when Abraham did

434
00:23:48.285 --> 00:23:51.245
what he was called to do, what happened? God blessed

435
00:23:51.425 --> 00:23:52.425
Him.

436
00:23:52.865 --> 00:23:54.525
He didn't understand. He was confused.

437
00:23:54.745 --> 00:23:55.925
And I look around this room

438
00:23:57.545 --> 00:23:59.645
and I know so many stories

439
00:24:02.815 --> 00:24:07.405
where you've suffered loss, you've had an illness,

440
00:24:08.545 --> 00:24:11.605
you've had financial struggles here and there.

441
00:24:11.665 --> 00:24:14.325
And yet I watch and hear me.

442
00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:18.485
I'm so built up in my faith watching

443
00:24:19.305 --> 00:24:23.245
people walk through story after story after story

444
00:24:23.305 --> 00:24:25.205
and look back and see what God has done

445
00:24:25.205 --> 00:24:26.685
and declare what God has done,

446
00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:29.085
bless them in it and through it.

447
00:24:33.265 --> 00:24:36.085
And so we can look at God's way, his guidance,

448
00:24:36.265 --> 00:24:40.405
and we can see his blessings and we can identify

449
00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:41.765
and we can celebrate.

450
00:24:41.865 --> 00:24:44.325
And that is one way

451
00:24:45.305 --> 00:24:47.125
to grow in our gladness in

452
00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:48.185
God.

453
00:24:50.275 --> 00:24:53.415
But we can also look back at his righteous judgment

454
00:24:53.915 --> 00:24:55.455
as Psalm 67 says.

455
00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:57.375
And we can know that that's a good thing.

456
00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:02.025
Yet how do we look at judgment as a good thing?

457
00:25:02.025 --> 00:25:03.985
Because the reality is that we all stand guilty

458
00:25:03.985 --> 00:25:05.225
according to his standard.

459
00:25:05.245 --> 00:25:07.985
If he is the judge, we're guilty for him.

460
00:25:08.965 --> 00:25:10.305
So how does that spark praise?

461
00:25:11.165 --> 00:25:13.105
How does that spark gladness in God

462
00:25:13.105 --> 00:25:14.465
by looking at his judgment?

463
00:25:16.055 --> 00:25:20.345
Because verse two also included, remember his saving power.

464
00:25:23.925 --> 00:25:28.785
So he's the judge and he has saving power.

465
00:25:29.025 --> 00:25:31.025
'cause just think about this, right? Our good father

466
00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:36.905
has blessed us by sending his only begotten son

467
00:25:37.885 --> 00:25:39.625
to be in our place for

468
00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:44.175
Us To, to take

469
00:25:44.325 --> 00:25:45.495
through his life, death

470
00:25:45.495 --> 00:25:49.415
and resurrection on that cross in his grave coming out

471
00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:52.135
of it, all of that, that that counts for us.

472
00:25:52.365 --> 00:25:55.815
That that covers our whole sin, that that takes

473
00:25:55.815 --> 00:25:58.255
that judgment away from us.

474
00:25:58.555 --> 00:26:01.295
And that he defeats sin and death on our behalf.

475
00:26:01.555 --> 00:26:04.495
And so the judgment is actually a blessing when we look

476
00:26:04.495 --> 00:26:05.575
at it from that perspective.

477
00:26:06.035 --> 00:26:09.935
Yes. And so that

478
00:26:10.475 --> 00:26:12.935
as a believer, that is how we can know

479
00:26:13.745 --> 00:26:15.215
God's blessings, right?

480
00:26:15.215 --> 00:26:17.375
We can be reminded, we can grow in gladness.

481
00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:19.175
That's why we preach the gospel. That's why we sing the

482
00:26:19.175 --> 00:26:21.815
gospel to just increase our gladness

483
00:26:22.075 --> 00:26:23.255
in God for what he's done.

484
00:26:26.015 --> 00:26:27.525
We've received material blessings.

485
00:26:27.525 --> 00:26:30.485
None of us in this room richer than 99% of the world

486
00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:31.565
around us.

487
00:26:33.355 --> 00:26:35.485
Like we've received material blessing.

488
00:26:35.585 --> 00:26:37.645
We can be grateful for that.

489
00:26:37.705 --> 00:26:39.565
But even more importantly,

490
00:26:39.575 --> 00:26:41.365
we've received spiritual blessings

491
00:26:43.025 --> 00:26:45.925
and increases our love for him when we think and reflect

492
00:26:45.925 --> 00:26:50.845
and rejoice, even just

493
00:26:50.845 --> 00:26:54.445
look at the second line of verse six, look at,

494
00:26:54.515 --> 00:26:55.565
look at verse six here.

495
00:26:58.345 --> 00:27:00.205
The earth has yielded its increase.

496
00:27:01.185 --> 00:27:05.415
God, our God shall bless us,

497
00:27:06.865 --> 00:27:08.815
might just skim over that really fast.

498
00:27:08.915 --> 00:27:11.575
But, but this is, this is talking about not just some God

499
00:27:11.575 --> 00:27:12.775
who's abstract out there.

500
00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:16.135
We don't know who he is. No, this is a personal God.

501
00:27:16.245 --> 00:27:18.255
This is our God. It says

502
00:27:20.015 --> 00:27:21.975
'cause That's what he's wanting us to seek.

503
00:27:24.965 --> 00:27:29.055
He's wanting us to seek the treasure of an intimate,

504
00:27:29.425 --> 00:27:32.255
close knit relationship with God through Jesus Christ.

505
00:27:34.275 --> 00:27:37.895
Not just a religious action, not just a set of morals

506
00:27:37.925 --> 00:27:39.775
that I lived better than I used to.

507
00:27:40.085 --> 00:27:42.855
Like an intimate relationship with the God of the universe

508
00:27:43.005 --> 00:27:44.335
through Jesus Christ.

509
00:27:44.335 --> 00:27:47.855
Where like Ephesians three says, we can know the love

510
00:27:47.855 --> 00:27:49.975
of Christ that surpasses knowledge.

511
00:27:51.285 --> 00:27:53.375
Like how do you know something that surpasses knowledge?

512
00:27:53.375 --> 00:27:58.075
It's because it's in here that you may be

513
00:27:58.235 --> 00:28:00.355
filled with all the fullness of God.

514
00:28:01.265 --> 00:28:02.635
What a blessing. When you answered

515
00:28:02.635 --> 00:28:03.675
that question at the beginning, I

516
00:28:03.675 --> 00:28:04.795
wanna be blessed by God, right?

517
00:28:05.055 --> 00:28:08.435
Filled with all the fullness of God. What a blessing.

518
00:28:10.995 --> 00:28:14.275
Stunning. So seek it. Yes, seek it.

519
00:28:14.655 --> 00:28:16.715
You may love him more.

520
00:28:19.775 --> 00:28:24.435
Yet again, like for Abraham, like

521
00:28:24.435 --> 00:28:28.475
for Israel, he has not given us those blessings

522
00:28:28.545 --> 00:28:29.995
just for ourselves.

523
00:28:32.785 --> 00:28:35.165
We are also to seek God's blessings so

524
00:28:35.165 --> 00:28:37.605
that we can live sin more widely.

525
00:28:41.065 --> 00:28:43.845
To love him more deeply. Yes.

526
00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:49.045
And to live sin more widely.

527
00:28:53.285 --> 00:28:57.605
Remember verse one, may God be gracious to us, bless us,

528
00:28:58.075 --> 00:29:00.645
make his face shine upon us.

529
00:29:00.775 --> 00:29:02.685
Great prayer. Keep praying that.

530
00:29:03.065 --> 00:29:05.885
But verse two starts with right that

531
00:29:07.635 --> 00:29:09.965
John Piper says, that's the key word of the whole verse that

532
00:29:12.175 --> 00:29:13.685
bless us, God bless us God,

533
00:29:13.875 --> 00:29:16.405
that your way may be known on earth.

534
00:29:16.545 --> 00:29:19.285
You are saving power among all nations.

535
00:29:19.665 --> 00:29:22.205
That's the reason God has blessed us.

536
00:29:22.445 --> 00:29:24.485
'cause remember the core of the Psalm,

537
00:29:24.595 --> 00:29:26.965
like remember the point of the puffins beak, right?

538
00:29:27.915 --> 00:29:28.925
Like when you see that picture

539
00:29:29.065 --> 00:29:31.525
and you see a puff, you think of this right here.

540
00:29:32.945 --> 00:29:35.405
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy.

541
00:29:35.715 --> 00:29:38.405
Amen. The whole thing is blessing us.

542
00:29:38.515 --> 00:29:41.965
He's pointing us to let the nations be glad

543
00:29:41.965 --> 00:29:44.485
that God blessing his people with guidance

544
00:29:44.585 --> 00:29:47.245
and salvation would lead, like Revelation said,

545
00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:49.885
re lead all people groups

546
00:29:49.945 --> 00:29:51.645
to be represented around the throne of God.

547
00:29:52.835 --> 00:29:54.965
Like that was God's heart from the beginning.

548
00:29:55.035 --> 00:29:56.685
He's not second plan B.

549
00:29:56.685 --> 00:29:57.965
Like, this is how we're gonna work this.

550
00:29:57.985 --> 00:30:00.085
Oh, I guess I gotta call. No, all the people

551
00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:04.205
from Genesis 12, all the families,

552
00:30:05.105 --> 00:30:08.805
all the nations, Jesus, Matthew 28,

553
00:30:09.345 --> 00:30:12.005
go into all nations and make disciples, right?

554
00:30:12.635 --> 00:30:16.725
This is a theme. So when you tie this together,

555
00:30:18.305 --> 00:30:20.685
it seems here that if we want

556
00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:23.285
to increase our gladness in God,

557
00:30:26.155 --> 00:30:28.725
then our hearts must be globally focused.

558
00:30:28.755 --> 00:30:31.805
Like God says, if we want

559
00:30:31.805 --> 00:30:33.605
to increase our own gladness in God,

560
00:30:33.605 --> 00:30:35.045
which is a right desire,

561
00:30:37.105 --> 00:30:39.685
our hearts should be globally focused like God says.

562
00:30:39.685 --> 00:30:42.685
Because God promises to bless his people

563
00:30:42.985 --> 00:30:45.045
to be a blessing to the nations.

564
00:30:48.665 --> 00:30:51.245
Now, you might think I, I had to wrestle with this like,

565
00:30:51.245 --> 00:30:55.805
is God just using us then We're just tools vessels, is

566
00:30:55.805 --> 00:30:57.045
that, is that all we are?

567
00:30:58.465 --> 00:30:59.765
No, he does it this way

568
00:31:00.515 --> 00:31:02.405
because he loves the nations,

569
00:31:04.745 --> 00:31:09.565
But also because he knows that our joy in all that God is

570
00:31:09.625 --> 00:31:13.525
for us, it increases

571
00:31:14.425 --> 00:31:16.325
as it expands into the lives of others.

572
00:31:18.355 --> 00:31:21.405
Like when you can take that joy God's given you

573
00:31:21.665 --> 00:31:24.085
and you can expand it into the lives of others like it,

574
00:31:24.155 --> 00:31:27.165
it's doubling, tripling in your own heart

575
00:31:27.305 --> 00:31:28.765
as you serve, as you give, as you.

576
00:31:28.875 --> 00:31:30.525
It's so joy filling.

577
00:31:32.355 --> 00:31:34.005
It's better to give than receive, right?

578
00:31:37.545 --> 00:31:39.965
But I love how John Piper said it in his famous book,

579
00:31:39.985 --> 00:31:43.565
let the Nations Be Glad He said, if God blesses his people

580
00:31:43.625 --> 00:31:46.645
for the sake of the nations, then God is most likely

581
00:31:46.705 --> 00:31:49.285
to bless us when we are planning and longing

582
00:31:49.285 --> 00:31:51.405
and praying to bless the nations.

583
00:31:52.425 --> 00:31:56.085
If God wants his goods to get to the nations,

584
00:31:56.545 --> 00:31:59.405
he will fill the truck that's driving toward the nations.

585
00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:04.125
He will bless the church that's pur pouring itself out

586
00:32:04.145 --> 00:32:05.445
for the unreached peoples of the world.

587
00:32:06.105 --> 00:32:09.805
And this blessing is not payment for a service rendered

588
00:32:10.945 --> 00:32:14.245
its power and joy for a mission to accomplish.

589
00:32:16.665 --> 00:32:18.795
When we move toward the unreached peoples,

590
00:32:18.815 --> 00:32:20.835
we are not earning God's blessings.

591
00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:24.035
We're leaping into the river of blessings

592
00:32:24.105 --> 00:32:26.395
that is already flowing to the nations.

593
00:32:29.725 --> 00:32:31.985
In other words, we're just joining God in

594
00:32:31.985 --> 00:32:36.105
what he's already doing and he's gonna bless that, right?

595
00:32:38.495 --> 00:32:42.085
This is why we're planning on hiring our first church

596
00:32:42.325 --> 00:32:43.605
planning resident this summer.

597
00:32:45.475 --> 00:32:49.165
This is why we're expanding global mission trip

598
00:32:49.165 --> 00:32:50.605
opportunities left and right.

599
00:32:53.165 --> 00:32:55.255
This is why we host evangelism trainings

600
00:32:55.555 --> 00:32:58.855
and encouraging block parties at Christmas and July 4th

601
00:32:59.035 --> 00:33:02.375
and mission outreach for VBS to your neighborhoods.

602
00:33:05.175 --> 00:33:09.265
This is why we long for every single person in our church

603
00:33:09.285 --> 00:33:14.105
to be involved in going, sending, praying, giving,

604
00:33:14.595 --> 00:33:19.145
supporting what God is doing here in his mission work.

605
00:33:22.025 --> 00:33:24.665
I read this quote. It's been said that every lamp

606
00:33:24.975 --> 00:33:27.945
that is lighted is lighted to shine,

607
00:33:30.795 --> 00:33:33.335
not to put under that bushel, hide.

608
00:33:34.165 --> 00:33:38.095
It's to shine So that they may see your good works

609
00:33:38.115 --> 00:33:40.855
and glorify your father who is in heaven.

610
00:33:42.355 --> 00:33:45.575
But every lamp, every light of the world, now that you

611
00:33:45.575 --> 00:33:48.495
and I are, is lighted to shine.

612
00:33:51.445 --> 00:33:55.115
Which is why every worship gathering, what do we end with?

613
00:33:55.535 --> 00:33:58.435
We are sent, I've changed that a little bit by the way

614
00:33:59.055 --> 00:34:01.475
you say you are sent, but I'm included in that too.

615
00:34:02.975 --> 00:34:04.195
We are sent.

616
00:34:04.255 --> 00:34:08.465
Are sent 'cause.

617
00:34:08.705 --> 00:34:10.945
'cause just like God, the Son was sent by God the Father,

618
00:34:11.685 --> 00:34:14.345
and then God the Son turned to his disciples

619
00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:19.545
and by extension us sent us to the nations.

620
00:34:21.805 --> 00:34:25.945
Romans 10 says this, everyone who calls on the name

621
00:34:25.945 --> 00:34:27.145
of the Lord will be saved.

622
00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:29.185
How then will they call on him

623
00:34:29.185 --> 00:34:30.505
and whom they've not believed?

624
00:34:31.085 --> 00:34:34.465
How are they to believe in him of whom they've never heard?

625
00:34:35.045 --> 00:34:37.425
And how are they to hear without someone preaching?

626
00:34:37.845 --> 00:34:39.025
And how are they to preach

627
00:34:39.325 --> 00:34:42.665
unless they are sent as it is written?

628
00:34:42.845 --> 00:34:45.905
How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good

629
00:34:46.535 --> 00:34:47.535
News?

630
00:34:48.965 --> 00:34:53.025
That's for each one of us, not just for the missionaries

631
00:34:53.245 --> 00:34:57.745
or the pastors, every single one of us.

632
00:34:58.255 --> 00:35:01.585
Some of us are called to move to other nations. Yes.

633
00:35:01.805 --> 00:35:04.305
And that might be what God is calling some of you right now

634
00:35:04.305 --> 00:35:06.465
to do, is to go to the nations for his glory,

635
00:35:06.685 --> 00:35:10.465
for your own joy in some way, but for His glory.

636
00:35:10.695 --> 00:35:11.905
Some of us are called,

637
00:35:12.245 --> 00:35:15.425
but all of us are called to move toward our neighborhoods

638
00:35:16.965 --> 00:35:18.465
and the nations that have moved here.

639
00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:24.265
All of us, because Romans 10 leads us

640
00:35:24.265 --> 00:35:26.545
to believe people can't be glad in God

641
00:35:26.605 --> 00:35:27.665
if they don't know him.

642
00:35:32.565 --> 00:35:37.245
And so we send, and our joy is more

643
00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:41.125
full when we respond to God's blessings in these ways.

644
00:35:45.525 --> 00:35:48.685
A few years ago we, we studied through the book of Judges

645
00:35:49.305 --> 00:35:50.645
during our worship gatherings.

646
00:35:51.115 --> 00:35:53.205
Some of you might remember that we entitled

647
00:35:53.205 --> 00:35:55.445
that series identity crisis.

648
00:35:56.845 --> 00:35:59.325
'cause judges is filled with God's people forgetting

649
00:35:59.385 --> 00:36:02.925
who they were in relation to who God is turning away

650
00:36:02.945 --> 00:36:04.165
to idol after idol.

651
00:36:05.905 --> 00:36:08.125
And one of the challenges that we gave at that time was

652
00:36:08.125 --> 00:36:10.805
to memorize one Peter two, nine and 10

653
00:36:12.915 --> 00:36:17.485
because it reminds us of our identity in Christ

654
00:36:18.705 --> 00:36:21.685
to keep us from slipping into

655
00:36:21.835 --> 00:36:23.885
forgetfulness as well.

656
00:36:26.825 --> 00:36:27.845
Listen to what it says.

657
00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:32.405
But you talking to believers, right?

658
00:36:33.665 --> 00:36:37.965
You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,

659
00:36:39.125 --> 00:36:43.245
a holy nation, a people for his own possession

660
00:36:43.875 --> 00:36:47.045
that you may proclaim the excellencies of him

661
00:36:47.045 --> 00:36:50.565
who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light

662
00:36:52.355 --> 00:36:55.565
once you were not a people, but now you are God's people.

663
00:36:57.055 --> 00:37:00.985
Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received

664
00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:05.015
Mercy Like you see how beautiful that is,

665
00:37:07.115 --> 00:37:08.175
how that reminds us.

666
00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:11.695
But, but think about how it relates to Psalm 67,

667
00:37:13.615 --> 00:37:17.305
that if you are in Abraham by faith in Christ,

668
00:37:17.645 --> 00:37:19.705
if you're a part of Genesis twelve's, blessing

669
00:37:19.705 --> 00:37:22.465
of all the families, that's what Galatians three says.

670
00:37:22.525 --> 00:37:26.065
If you are in Christ, you are God's special,

671
00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:28.825
very own cherished possession.

672
00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:32.225
Like in my sin, I was far from God,

673
00:37:32.245 --> 00:37:34.425
but now in Christ, I've been brought near.

674
00:37:34.455 --> 00:37:35.665
I've received mercy.

675
00:37:36.285 --> 00:37:38.865
I'm a part of God's people where I wasn't part of before.

676
00:37:40.805 --> 00:37:45.745
Yet again, did you see why? Why did God do that?

677
00:37:45.885 --> 00:37:50.665
Why did God bless that you may proclaim the excellencies

678
00:37:50.765 --> 00:37:53.225
of him who called you into his marvelous light?

679
00:37:55.005 --> 00:37:56.345
Do you see the gladness there?

680
00:37:59.285 --> 00:38:03.345
Marvelous light, not just any light, marvelous light,

681
00:38:03.485 --> 00:38:08.025
the excellencies, the the honor of who he is.

682
00:38:08.125 --> 00:38:10.345
That's what we get to proclaim.

683
00:38:10.405 --> 00:38:13.545
We have joyful access to him as his children,

684
00:38:13.685 --> 00:38:14.905
as a part of his family.

685
00:38:16.175 --> 00:38:18.875
And so, like Westminster said a long time ago, the purpose

686
00:38:18.975 --> 00:38:22.915
of our lives is to glorify God

687
00:38:23.015 --> 00:38:27.795
and to enjoy him forever, to receive his blessings,

688
00:38:27.795 --> 00:38:31.475
to enjoy those things absolutely grow ever deeper in

689
00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:32.555
our love for him.

690
00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:36.805
But all of it is also so that we may use it

691
00:38:37.265 --> 00:38:38.925
for his glory among the nations.

692
00:38:40.155 --> 00:38:44.005
It's not just for us. It's for His glory.

693
00:38:45.795 --> 00:38:46.855
And so let's seek him.

694
00:38:47.075 --> 00:38:50.955
Church, let's love him

695
00:38:52.635 --> 00:38:55.605
because he's made us glad

696
00:38:56.985 --> 00:39:00.725
and let's live for him because he's made us glad.
