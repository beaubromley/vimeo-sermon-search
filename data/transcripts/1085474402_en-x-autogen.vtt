1
00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:35.115
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.755
It's great to see you. Uh, I pray that you're doing well

3
00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:40.835
and they're not too tired after the storms last night.

4
00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.915
Um, but as we get into it today, I once heard

5
00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:46.355
a teacher talk about how she used

6
00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:49.795
to make her students in elementary school walk laps

7
00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:51.515
around the playground at recess.

8
00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:55.835
And one morning, uh, the one girl comes up to her

9
00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:59.915
and reports that another student had cut the corner

10
00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.075
while she was walking her laps.

11
00:01:03.115 --> 00:01:05.855
So the teacher invites the other student over

12
00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:09.175
and just calmly asks her, did, did you,

13
00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:10.615
while you were walking your laps earlier,

14
00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:11.815
did, did you cut the corner?

15
00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:16.135
And the girl nervously looked away and said, no.

16
00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:19.545
Now this teacher was an old school,

17
00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:21.145
knew all the tricks, kind of teacher.

18
00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:26.505
And so she asks again this time, added some magical words

19
00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:28.505
to the end of the question.

20
00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:33.145
And she said, did you cut the corner just a little bit?

21
00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:37.635
And for some reason, that gave the girl

22
00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:39.275
vulnerability to share the truth.

23
00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:43.915
And she said, yes, ma'am. Now, why do I share that?

24
00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:48.425
Because I fear that many of us

25
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.225
treat holiness in our lives in the same way.

26
00:01:56.655 --> 00:02:00.275
See, most of us are not pursuing like the big sins,

27
00:02:02.675 --> 00:02:05.675
but all of us are prone

28
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:07.995
to wander just a little bit.

29
00:02:12.835 --> 00:02:14.375
But this is really important to talk about.

30
00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:18.145
This is really important because you

31
00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:20.225
and me growing in purity

32
00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:23.105
and growing in obedience to God is

33
00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:27.585
what God has for us as his purpose for our lives.

34
00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:30.805
This is his will for us.

35
00:02:30.915 --> 00:02:33.805
This is what first Thessalonians four verse three says,

36
00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:38.005
this is the will of God, your sanctification.

37
00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:44.135
This is what God designed us for, God's purpose,

38
00:02:44.275 --> 00:02:48.895
for your life and for mine is to realign us back

39
00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:52.415
to the perfect standard that Jesus set like He showed us

40
00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:55.215
what a perfect human life looks like.

41
00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:01.655
Yet here's, here's the problem. As we look at a standard

42
00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:04.335
like that, as we look at Jesus being perfect, it,

43
00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:06.655
it prompts a couple questions in our minds.

44
00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:09.775
First of all, like, okay, am I anywhere close to that?

45
00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:11.535
Am I growing towards that?

46
00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:13.735
What does that look like compared to me?

47
00:03:15.805 --> 00:03:18.385
We know that's what we're supposed to be someday.

48
00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:22.305
But, but, but how, how can I even grow into that image

49
00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:25.095
that seems so impossible?

50
00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:28.055
How is it even possible for me in this life?

51
00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:33.455
Well, that's what I hope you see today in God's word.

52
00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:37.865
And so turn back with me to Romans chapter 12.

53
00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:41.825
We're walking through this chapter over the next couple

54
00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:43.145
months, just what does it look like

55
00:03:43.145 --> 00:03:45.825
to live a transformed life in Christ?

56
00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:50.105
Romans 12 specifically verse nine.

57
00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:51.705
Today is where we're going to be Again,

58
00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:53.305
everything in this chapter is a response

59
00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:54.505
to God's great love for us.

60
00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:58.625
Everything in this chapter is, is geared in line with that.

61
00:03:58.645 --> 00:04:00.985
All the commands are are for that gift.

62
00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:02.785
And, and in response to that gift,

63
00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:03.905
that's what this chapter is.

64
00:04:03.905 --> 00:04:06.455
It's reflection in response.

65
00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:10.225
As we looked at verse nine, the first phrase,

66
00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:11.505
let love be genuine last week.

67
00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:14.785
But there's two more phrases here in verse nine.

68
00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:16.505
That's what we're gonna study today.

69
00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:19.505
These two phrases, look at how it continues.

70
00:04:21.205 --> 00:04:25.835
Abhor, what is evil? Hold fast to what is good.

71
00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:29.955
Abhor what is evil? Hold fast to

72
00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:33.785
what is good, God is.

73
00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:35.665
As we look at this, we realize

74
00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:37.065
and acknowledge this is your word.

75
00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:40.865
This is as short as it is, as simple as it may seem.

76
00:04:40.885 --> 00:04:41.905
We know it's not easy

77
00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:43.785
and we know that, that what you're doing

78
00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:47.385
with this is you're wanting to reset our hearts

79
00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:50.265
and draw us to you and lead us in the way of our lasting.

80
00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:53.865
So God, I pray we would all look deeply

81
00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:56.505
as you show us deeply.

82
00:04:58.015 --> 00:04:59.755
If there's any wicked way in us,

83
00:05:01.295 --> 00:05:03.675
and you would lead us in that way everlasting

84
00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:08.285
for your glory, for our good, we would see it and follow it.

85
00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:11.005
In Jesus' name. Amen.

86
00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:16.005
So I already said we're gonna talk about holiness today.

87
00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:18.485
What even is holiness like we need

88
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.765
to define the term if we're talking about it today is,

89
00:05:20.785 --> 00:05:24.405
is holiness like mere moral improvement to just kind

90
00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:26.845
of grow in your ability, maybe even moral perfection?

91
00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:28.005
Is that what holiness is?

92
00:05:28.225 --> 00:05:31.885
Or is holiness more of like a, an internal thing

93
00:05:31.885 --> 00:05:34.725
that it it deals with something on the inside?

94
00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:41.945
Yes. Like both it, it's used in scripture both ways.

95
00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:44.995
It indicates a moral quality

96
00:05:44.995 --> 00:05:47.475
that someone is living more like Christ.

97
00:05:47.475 --> 00:05:50.675
That's holiness. It talks about it in that way. Absolutely.

98
00:05:50.695 --> 00:05:51.995
And you can grow in that.

99
00:05:52.255 --> 00:05:55.555
It also talks about just the nature of something

100
00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.605
that it is holy.

101
00:05:59.995 --> 00:06:01.975
That's actually the foundation we're gonna set today.

102
00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:03.655
You remember last week if you were here,

103
00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:04.735
we talked about love

104
00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:07.495
and how God's love is the foundation for our love.

105
00:06:07.595 --> 00:06:09.375
We love because he's first loved us.

106
00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:11.735
There's a similar foundation we're setting here today.

107
00:06:12.085 --> 00:06:16.255
It's the fact that God in Christ, if you are in Christ,

108
00:06:16.555 --> 00:06:20.735
he has made you holy like you are holy.

109
00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:24.245
The rest of today we're gonna build off of this,

110
00:06:24.595 --> 00:06:27.845
that if you are in Christ, if you have believed,

111
00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:30.005
like if you have given your heart

112
00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:31.005
and your faith to

113
00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:35.095
Jesus, then you are holy.

114
00:06:37.985 --> 00:06:40.405
Now. We'll, we'll we'll look at the progressive nature

115
00:06:40.425 --> 00:06:41.965
of this a little bit later.

116
00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:43.725
'cause I know some of you're even thinking about this.

117
00:06:43.725 --> 00:06:44.765
Like I'm not holy. Look at

118
00:06:44.765 --> 00:06:46.045
what I did this morning to my kids.

119
00:06:46.045 --> 00:06:48.445
Right? No. So it's not about that yet.

120
00:06:48.445 --> 00:06:49.645
We'll get there right now.

121
00:06:49.645 --> 00:06:52.325
What we're talking about is positional holiness.

122
00:06:55.045 --> 00:06:58.905
Who you are in Christ, who he's made you to be.

123
00:06:59.015 --> 00:07:00.345
This is what we're talking about here.

124
00:07:00.665 --> 00:07:02.505
Remember Romans 12, one, the first verse

125
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.425
of this whole chapter we spent a couple

126
00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:06.105
weeks ago looking at this.

127
00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:07.625
It says, I appeal to you,

128
00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:10.185
therefore brothers, by the mercies of God

129
00:07:10.405 --> 00:07:14.585
to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy

130
00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:19.435
and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.

131
00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:22.355
We, we looked at that and we said, you already are holy.

132
00:07:22.735 --> 00:07:25.235
So you can know that when you offer yourself,

133
00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:27.755
you're an acceptable sacrifice to God.

134
00:07:28.575 --> 00:07:30.355
So offer so die to self.

135
00:07:30.545 --> 00:07:34.475
Give yourself to the Lord because you already are holy.

136
00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:39.805
It's all over the scriptures though. Titus three verse five.

137
00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:41.965
He saved us not

138
00:07:41.965 --> 00:07:44.725
because of works done by us in righteousness,

139
00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:49.005
but according to his own mercy, by the washing

140
00:07:49.945 --> 00:07:53.725
of regeneration and the renewal of the Holy Spirit.

141
00:07:56.165 --> 00:07:59.815
That means that you are seen as clean now no matter

142
00:07:59.815 --> 00:08:02.295
what you've done, how much you've done, God looks at you,

143
00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:05.815
washed clean by His grace,

144
00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:09.745
his mercy elsewhere.

145
00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:13.025
One Peter two verse nine says that we are now a

146
00:08:13.575 --> 00:08:15.105
holy nation.

147
00:08:17.905 --> 00:08:21.335
Later in Hebrews verse th verse 12 of chapter 13,

148
00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:25.775
Jesus' death it says was to satisfy the people,

149
00:08:26.095 --> 00:08:28.775
sanctify the people through his blood.

150
00:08:29.735 --> 00:08:31.375
Sanctify means to make holy.

151
00:08:31.715 --> 00:08:36.095
His death was to make his people holy.

152
00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:41.525
So again, here's the foundation we will build off of this.

153
00:08:41.545 --> 00:08:44.365
We can't forget this. If you are in Christ,

154
00:08:44.465 --> 00:08:47.485
if you are a believer by faith in Jesus' life, death

155
00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.485
and resurrection for you, if that's where your heart aligns,

156
00:08:50.545 --> 00:08:53.765
you stand in that, then spiritually you stand

157
00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:55.245
holy before God.

158
00:08:56.795 --> 00:09:01.445
That is your position and God made you that, right?

159
00:09:01.445 --> 00:09:03.685
This is not, you earned it somehow.

160
00:09:04.035 --> 00:09:06.485
This is not, you did improve morally enough

161
00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:08.085
to be able to stand before God.

162
00:09:08.085 --> 00:09:10.365
Like that. You couldn't. I couldn't.

163
00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:15.705
But God did and made you that for you

164
00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:20.785
because of that.

165
00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:24.255
Then because of that,

166
00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:27.775
when Jesus then says, be holy,

167
00:09:28.395 --> 00:09:32.005
as I am holy, what he means

168
00:09:33.305 --> 00:09:35.885
is live out who you already are.

169
00:09:38.415 --> 00:09:42.135
'cause be holy is passive, right? Like it's, it's a given.

170
00:09:42.445 --> 00:09:45.335
It's a received, you're positionally holy.

171
00:09:45.675 --> 00:09:47.575
So be that like you already are.

172
00:09:48.935 --> 00:09:52.265
Live it out by God's power,

173
00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:56.905
realign your daily lifestyle with your spiritual reality.

174
00:09:58.055 --> 00:10:00.825
This is who you are. So start living it out.

175
00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:04.705
You are positionally in Christ already this, that's

176
00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:05.945
what Romans one through 11 says.

177
00:10:05.965 --> 00:10:07.465
By the way, it defends

178
00:10:07.465 --> 00:10:09.465
that you are positionally in Christ there.

179
00:10:09.815 --> 00:10:13.745
Then practically work that out more every day.

180
00:10:14.935 --> 00:10:17.875
That's Romans 12 through 16, right?

181
00:10:18.195 --> 00:10:21.315
Positionally, you are this. So practically work this out.

182
00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:24.755
Specifically chapter 12 gives us the character that we need

183
00:10:24.755 --> 00:10:26.155
to have specifically here today.

184
00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:28.515
Verse nine. This is how you do that.

185
00:10:30.065 --> 00:10:32.885
How do you live out that you're already holy?

186
00:10:33.075 --> 00:10:35.085
What does that look like day to day?

187
00:10:37.645 --> 00:10:42.035
What did he say first here again as a response

188
00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:44.035
to already be made holy.

189
00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:47.755
What does he say abhor, what is evil?

190
00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:51.865
How do we do? How do we live it out?

191
00:10:52.525 --> 00:10:55.025
How do we live off the foundation of holiness?

192
00:10:56.085 --> 00:11:00.385
We abhor what is evil? What is rotten?

193
00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:03.435
What doesn't line up with the character of God?

194
00:11:03.435 --> 00:11:04.595
That's that word evil.

195
00:11:06.545 --> 00:11:08.605
Now, I know that word abhor is one

196
00:11:08.605 --> 00:11:10.405
that we don't use very often, first of all

197
00:11:10.525 --> 00:11:11.885
'cause it's hard to say doesn't

198
00:11:11.885 --> 00:11:13.085
roll off the tongue very easily.

199
00:11:13.265 --> 00:11:16.765
But, but can we agree that it just sounds terrible,

200
00:11:16.955 --> 00:11:21.205
doesn't it right to abhor something like it just,

201
00:11:21.345 --> 00:11:23.525
it just really makes you feel bad.

202
00:11:23.585 --> 00:11:25.765
And we often use the word hate here instead,

203
00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:28.085
but let's not miss the nuance.

204
00:11:29.765 --> 00:11:32.065
Why did God's word pick this word?

205
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:38.325
Because the word abhor brings with it the idea

206
00:11:38.385 --> 00:11:42.845
of having a visceral reaction to something you dislike

207
00:11:43.345 --> 00:11:44.765
so much so that you avoid it.

208
00:11:47.015 --> 00:11:48.945
When I was a kid, my mom paid me $5

209
00:11:49.045 --> 00:11:50.625
to try a little piece of tomato.

210
00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:56.765
And let's just say I had a visceral reaction to it.

211
00:11:57.025 --> 00:11:59.965
My gag reflex hit really hard. And so what do I do now?

212
00:12:00.245 --> 00:12:03.845
I avoid tomatoes. It's just the reality of it.

213
00:12:04.205 --> 00:12:08.365
I, I had such a dislike that my body reacted to it

214
00:12:08.365 --> 00:12:11.045
and so now I avoid them completely.

215
00:12:12.655 --> 00:12:14.375
I know that's kind of silly compared to this, but,

216
00:12:14.515 --> 00:12:17.655
but that's the idea of abhorring something is that you,

217
00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:20.375
you strongly do not just like I kind of dislike it,

218
00:12:20.395 --> 00:12:24.575
but so strongly hate abhor it,

219
00:12:25.505 --> 00:12:26.755
that that's how you react.

220
00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:32.635
I love how the apostle Paul explained this more deeply over

221
00:12:32.695 --> 00:12:36.355
in Ephesians chapter five, verses three through 12.

222
00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:40.355
Just listen to with that idea of hor, of abhorring hating

223
00:12:40.355 --> 00:12:42.115
what is evil, listen to

224
00:12:42.115 --> 00:12:46.845
how he says it here in Ephesians five, sexual immorality

225
00:12:46.905 --> 00:12:48.245
and all impurity

226
00:12:48.385 --> 00:12:52.285
or covetousness must not even be named among you

227
00:12:52.995 --> 00:12:54.375
as is proper among saints.

228
00:12:55.075 --> 00:12:57.615
Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk

229
00:12:57.875 --> 00:12:59.855
nor crude joking, which are out of place.

230
00:13:00.275 --> 00:13:04.055
But instead, let there be thanksgiving for you may be sure

231
00:13:04.055 --> 00:13:06.375
of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure

232
00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:09.255
or who is covetous, that is an idolater,

233
00:13:09.515 --> 00:13:11.575
has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ.

234
00:13:11.595 --> 00:13:14.855
And God let no one deceive you

235
00:13:14.855 --> 00:13:16.655
with empty words for because of these things.

236
00:13:16.655 --> 00:13:19.135
The wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.

237
00:13:19.725 --> 00:13:21.735
Therefore, do not become partners with them.

238
00:13:22.195 --> 00:13:24.335
For at one time you were darkness,

239
00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.695
but now you are light in the Lord.

240
00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:29.215
Walk as children of light.

241
00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:32.335
For the fruit of light is found in all that is good

242
00:13:32.335 --> 00:13:33.615
and right and true

243
00:13:34.975 --> 00:13:37.755
and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.

244
00:13:39.605 --> 00:13:42.185
Now listen to this verse 11, take no part

245
00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:45.065
in the unfruitful works of darkness,

246
00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:50.185
but instead expose them for it is shameful even to speak

247
00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:54.705
of the things that they do in secret, right?

248
00:13:54.705 --> 00:13:56.065
That's pretty clear, isn't it?

249
00:13:58.255 --> 00:14:02.915
It says that Christians, we, we should hate evil so much

250
00:14:03.265 --> 00:14:08.135
that we avoid it, that we should be

251
00:14:08.345 --> 00:14:13.295
known for how much we don't even consider being a part

252
00:14:13.515 --> 00:14:16.935
of those kinds of things like sexual morality, greed,

253
00:14:17.145 --> 00:14:21.855
crude joking that we revile it so much

254
00:14:21.855 --> 00:14:23.815
that we avoid it all together.

255
00:14:24.075 --> 00:14:28.655
Why? Because those are examples of dark things

256
00:14:30.505 --> 00:14:32.205
and we aren't in darkness anymore.

257
00:14:34.215 --> 00:14:37.385
What does it say? He's made us light in the Lord.

258
00:14:37.565 --> 00:14:39.825
So if we're light not in darkness, we walk

259
00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:41.225
as if we are in the light.

260
00:14:41.225 --> 00:14:44.065
Now we walk as children of light. So we don't participate.

261
00:14:44.065 --> 00:14:45.385
We don't even want to participate

262
00:14:45.445 --> 00:14:46.585
in the things of the darkness.

263
00:14:51.695 --> 00:14:55.075
That's why the searching question

264
00:14:55.075 --> 00:14:59.985
that I asked myself all week in,

265
00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:02.465
in light of all of this, just like that teacher at recess,

266
00:15:02.965 --> 00:15:04.825
the searching question I asked was,

267
00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:08.465
how am I compromising just a little bit?

268
00:15:14.075 --> 00:15:18.845
How am I compromising just a little bit?

269
00:15:20.765 --> 00:15:22.405
I know how to avoid the big stuff, but,

270
00:15:22.545 --> 00:15:26.085
but just a little bit meaning like instead of hating

271
00:15:27.425 --> 00:15:29.845
any evil that still remains in my heart,

272
00:15:32.145 --> 00:15:34.045
I'm pretty content to let it simmer.

273
00:15:36.605 --> 00:15:37.745
Let it fester in there,

274
00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:41.145
dabble in it a little bit here and there.

275
00:15:42.475 --> 00:15:44.355
Like how, how am I

276
00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:47.515
compromising just a little bit?

277
00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:52.005
Like I know I'm positionally holy in Christ,

278
00:15:52.305 --> 00:15:54.845
but how am I not living that out

279
00:15:55.365 --> 00:15:56.725
progressively in my daily life?

280
00:15:58.345 --> 00:15:59.765
I'm just content to stay where I'm at.

281
00:15:59.765 --> 00:16:01.365
What, why am I doing it that way?

282
00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:07.285
See, listen, if I, if we were having a personal conversation

283
00:16:07.305 --> 00:16:11.335
and I asked you, have you, have you compromised your faith?

284
00:16:13.555 --> 00:16:16.755
I mean most of us would say pretty strongly, quickly, no,

285
00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:19.155
no, I'm a believer.

286
00:16:19.275 --> 00:16:20.835
I know I'm going to heaven when I die.

287
00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:22.035
I know I have a relationship with God.

288
00:16:22.135 --> 00:16:24.635
I'm forgiven of my sins. I haven't compromised my faith.

289
00:16:25.935 --> 00:16:30.835
But if I asked you, have you compromised just a little bit,

290
00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:34.475
would that change your answer?

291
00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:40.395
Like if you just sat on that question,

292
00:16:41.205 --> 00:16:42.835
maybe you'd write this down and do this later.

293
00:16:42.855 --> 00:16:44.995
If you, if you just sit on that question for a,

294
00:16:45.195 --> 00:16:46.195
a few quiet moments,

295
00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:48.275
and we'll do this again a little bit later, but,

296
00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:50.635
but if you just sat there and reflected

297
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.235
and asked God, a whole lot would rise

298
00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:54.515
to the sur surface, wouldn't it?

299
00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:57.415
If we're honest,

300
00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:00.975
if we just take Matthew five through seven,

301
00:17:00.975 --> 00:17:02.375
Jesus famous sermon on the Mount

302
00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:05.735
and just read through that, prayerfully asking, God, show me

303
00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.935
any wicked way in me, don't you think

304
00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:12.495
there'd be quite a few things start

305
00:17:12.495 --> 00:17:15.015
to get exposed in our hearts that we just let slide

306
00:17:15.015 --> 00:17:17.975
and then slip through and, and motives that are bad

307
00:17:18.075 --> 00:17:19.335
and, and we see all that.

308
00:17:19.355 --> 00:17:21.055
We start to let that rise to the surface.

309
00:17:21.245 --> 00:17:21.695
It's there

310
00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:28.305
like again, I saw it in myself this week.

311
00:17:31.465 --> 00:17:35.065
I know I fear, I, I know that I do this,

312
00:17:35.065 --> 00:17:36.705
but I fear that we

313
00:17:37.435 --> 00:17:40.945
allow a lot more in our lives than we're readily

314
00:17:40.945 --> 00:17:42.265
willing to admit.

315
00:17:45.615 --> 00:17:49.445
Like I fear that we don't hate sin as much as we say we do.

316
00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:56.945
See, here's what we're doing humans.

317
00:17:57.365 --> 00:18:02.225
We, we are so prone to set the standard from the bottom up.

318
00:18:04.305 --> 00:18:06.485
And so what we're doing is we're comparing ourselves

319
00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:11.325
to a murderer or to an adulterer or to Hitler

320
00:18:11.585 --> 00:18:13.325
or whatever, and we, we look at that,

321
00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:14.405
we're like, man, we're okay.

322
00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:16.245
I'm not as bad as they are.

323
00:18:16.275 --> 00:18:17.285
Look, I'm, I'm closer

324
00:18:17.465 --> 00:18:19.805
to straight vertical than they are like I I get.

325
00:18:23.985 --> 00:18:26.805
But when we look to Jesus and,

326
00:18:28.335 --> 00:18:32.835
and we, we see then how far from vertical

327
00:18:32.835 --> 00:18:34.075
that we really actually are,

328
00:18:37.455 --> 00:18:39.875
how much we allow in our lives, it's not of God.

329
00:18:39.975 --> 00:18:42.075
If we really just align ourselves and, and,

330
00:18:42.075 --> 00:18:43.915
and examine ourselves according to his standard,

331
00:18:44.095 --> 00:18:45.555
we are so far off.

332
00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:51.425
So then the question is what do we do with that?

333
00:18:52.695 --> 00:18:54.105
Like what should we do then?

334
00:18:56.375 --> 00:18:58.345
Well, what, what did Romans 12 say to do?

335
00:19:01.105 --> 00:19:02.695
Abhor? What is evil?

336
00:19:03.805 --> 00:19:05.575
Like when we see how far off we

337
00:19:05.575 --> 00:19:06.695
are, what do we do with that?

338
00:19:06.915 --> 00:19:10.775
We recommit to hating our sin like

339
00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:12.015
God hates our sin.

340
00:19:14.325 --> 00:19:15.785
And I'm talking about all of it,

341
00:19:15.965 --> 00:19:17.985
not just the big ones but all of it.

342
00:19:20.745 --> 00:19:21.765
Not just the actions

343
00:19:23.185 --> 00:19:26.765
but even the thoughts behind the actions.

344
00:19:28.465 --> 00:19:30.835
Like that's what Sermon on the Mount is so powerful to do.

345
00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:33.155
When Jesus talked about, he didn't just talk about actions,

346
00:19:33.155 --> 00:19:35.155
he talked about the motivations behind the actions.

347
00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:37.995
He talked about the reason you do fill in the blank.

348
00:19:39.685 --> 00:19:42.105
That's even what we must hate

349
00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:46.615
and we have to recommit to this.

350
00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:50.135
We have to, we have to crush the lust in our hearts

351
00:19:50.205 --> 00:19:53.095
that causes us to take a second glance at that woman.

352
00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:59.335
We have to die to the desire for a greater reputation

353
00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:01.095
that causes us to lie to people,

354
00:20:01.115 --> 00:20:02.135
to make ourselves look better.

355
00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:09.515
Like we have to cut off that relationship

356
00:20:09.665 --> 00:20:11.675
that is stirring up thoughts of gossip

357
00:20:12.055 --> 00:20:13.355
and bullying in your life.

358
00:20:14.795 --> 00:20:18.985
Cut it off. And again,

359
00:20:18.985 --> 00:20:19.985
we've gotta be active in this

360
00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:23.145
because like John Owens said about 500 years ago, he said,

361
00:20:23.145 --> 00:20:26.585
you've got to be killing sin or it will be killing you.

362
00:20:29.305 --> 00:20:30.795
This is a war, right?

363
00:20:30.795 --> 00:20:33.115
We can't just sit back and say, well it will be fine.

364
00:20:33.415 --> 00:20:38.075
No, in God's power, we have to commit to put sin to death,

365
00:20:38.335 --> 00:20:41.395
to kill it in our lives, to hate it.

366
00:20:41.735 --> 00:20:45.515
Not just try to manage it, not just try to tame it,

367
00:20:45.695 --> 00:20:47.685
not put it in the closet, stuff it back there

368
00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:50.165
so nobody sees it or that we hope it doesn't destroy us.

369
00:20:50.425 --> 00:20:52.965
No, we can't do that. We must kill it.

370
00:20:53.395 --> 00:20:57.005
Even if it costs us financially

371
00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:03.615
or professionally or socially,

372
00:21:06.835 --> 00:21:08.535
it might cost something

373
00:21:08.995 --> 00:21:11.895
but we must kill it.

374
00:21:17.205 --> 00:21:21.025
And listen, I say that strongly, which only makes me

375
00:21:21.025 --> 00:21:22.545
that much more grateful

376
00:21:23.565 --> 00:21:25.025
for the foundation that we started with.

377
00:21:27.665 --> 00:21:31.355
Remember, Christ already overcame sin.

378
00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:36.735
Christ has made you holy

379
00:21:38.035 --> 00:21:39.815
by winning that battle over sin.

380
00:21:40.735 --> 00:21:44.905
Like so Christ has defeated the sin that we wrestle with,

381
00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:46.505
the sin that we struggle with, the evil that surround us.

382
00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:49.625
He's already overcome it. He has already made us holy.

383
00:21:49.845 --> 00:21:53.505
And so what that means is the foundation must supersede

384
00:21:53.505 --> 00:21:55.345
what we've been talking about, how hard it is to do this.

385
00:21:55.525 --> 00:21:57.505
The foundation is that you can

386
00:21:59.245 --> 00:22:01.425
by God's power live out this reality

387
00:22:01.425 --> 00:22:03.145
that you already are holy in Christ.

388
00:22:03.375 --> 00:22:06.265
It's possible. I know it may seem impossible

389
00:22:07.005 --> 00:22:09.545
to overcome sin, to hate sin, yes,

390
00:22:10.885 --> 00:22:12.665
but in Christ it is possible

391
00:22:12.855 --> 00:22:14.985
because he's already got the victory over it.

392
00:22:16.225 --> 00:22:20.565
So take heart in that, right? Be grateful for that.

393
00:22:25.085 --> 00:22:27.775
When we saw Romans 12, nine, the rest of it there was,

394
00:22:27.775 --> 00:22:29.895
there was actually another imperative there, right?

395
00:22:31.975 --> 00:22:34.305
That last phrase of the verse, what did it say?

396
00:22:36.365 --> 00:22:39.295
Hold fast to what is good

397
00:22:43.725 --> 00:22:44.595
Abhor, what is evil?

398
00:22:45.185 --> 00:22:48.035
Hold fast to what is good.

399
00:22:49.765 --> 00:22:51.095
It's like the other end of the spectrum, right?

400
00:22:52.645 --> 00:22:54.335
It's almost like these are counterweights.

401
00:22:55.445 --> 00:22:59.455
That the way you abhor evil is by clinging more to

402
00:22:59.455 --> 00:23:02.055
what is good, to what aligns with God's character, to

403
00:23:02.055 --> 00:23:03.535
what he sees as good.

404
00:23:03.565 --> 00:23:05.015
It's like they go together.

405
00:23:05.315 --> 00:23:07.135
The more you do one, the less you do the other one, right?

406
00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:08.775
So they go together in this

407
00:23:08.875 --> 00:23:10.495
and in the original language, that word

408
00:23:10.835 --> 00:23:13.535
for hold fast is actually the idea

409
00:23:13.535 --> 00:23:17.455
of gluing things together, cementing together

410
00:23:17.715 --> 00:23:20.535
to join or fasten firmly together.

411
00:23:20.685 --> 00:23:23.575
It's the same word you might have heard at a wedding

412
00:23:24.455 --> 00:23:27.895
sometime ago, Genesis 2 24, all the way back

413
00:23:27.895 --> 00:23:28.895
before the fall of man.

414
00:23:28.895 --> 00:23:31.855
He says, therefore a man shall leave his father

415
00:23:32.155 --> 00:23:35.535
and his mother and hold fast to his wife

416
00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:39.535
and they shall become one flesh.

417
00:23:42.725 --> 00:23:44.615
That concept is all over God's word.

418
00:23:44.695 --> 00:23:47.525
A husband, husband and wife become one.

419
00:23:47.675 --> 00:23:48.765
They are distinct,

420
00:23:49.705 --> 00:23:52.365
but they are intimately joined together

421
00:23:52.745 --> 00:23:54.845
as if they are one entity.

422
00:23:57.385 --> 00:23:58.635
Beautiful picture of the gospel.

423
00:24:00.935 --> 00:24:05.885
Romans 12, nine says that we are to be

424
00:24:05.885 --> 00:24:08.005
that with what is good.

425
00:24:09.375 --> 00:24:14.145
Hold fast. Cement yourself to what is good.

426
00:24:14.285 --> 00:24:17.785
So much so that it's like you are one with it.

427
00:24:22.775 --> 00:24:27.445
Here's the problem though, I don't always

428
00:24:27.445 --> 00:24:28.485
do that very well.

429
00:24:31.435 --> 00:24:34.355
I don't, I don't hold fast to things

430
00:24:34.355 --> 00:24:36.595
that are good 100% of the time.

431
00:24:36.745 --> 00:24:38.875
Like I hold fast to myself a lot.

432
00:24:39.835 --> 00:24:42.235
I hold fast to my phone a lot.

433
00:24:42.595 --> 00:24:43.795
I hold fast to the things

434
00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:47.355
of the world a lot more than I hold fast to the things

435
00:24:47.705 --> 00:24:49.595
that are good at times in my life.

436
00:24:51.905 --> 00:24:53.125
And so this is reality.

437
00:24:53.195 --> 00:24:55.885
Like we don't always hold fast to what is good.

438
00:24:55.885 --> 00:24:58.565
And the the reality, the the truth is if we're fair,

439
00:25:01.255 --> 00:25:04.115
if we measure ourselves according to Christ's standard,

440
00:25:04.495 --> 00:25:07.515
we will always feel a little bit discouraged by

441
00:25:07.515 --> 00:25:09.355
how far we are off of that.

442
00:25:12.925 --> 00:25:14.945
So here's the wrestling we have to do.

443
00:25:15.085 --> 00:25:16.865
How do we then avoid hopelessness?

444
00:25:19.405 --> 00:25:21.875
We're supposed to to align ourselves.

445
00:25:21.875 --> 00:25:23.395
We're supposed to be like Christ.

446
00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:24.715
But we're so far from that.

447
00:25:24.715 --> 00:25:28.275
How can we not get hopeless in that struggle?

448
00:25:32.215 --> 00:25:33.405
Think about an oak tree.

449
00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:38.365
I read one author asked the question, how did

450
00:25:38.365 --> 00:25:39.365
that tree start?

451
00:25:42.335 --> 00:25:45.025
Well, with just an acorn, right?

452
00:25:45.025 --> 00:25:48.145
Like some absent-minded squirrel dropped it somewhere

453
00:25:48.165 --> 00:25:49.785
and it gets pressed into the soil.

454
00:25:50.205 --> 00:25:52.545
As it gets pressed into the soil, it begins to germinate

455
00:25:52.685 --> 00:25:56.765
and roots form, which led

456
00:25:56.765 --> 00:26:01.125
to a stem growing upward, which led to branches emerging,

457
00:26:01.135 --> 00:26:05.725
which led to then a few leaves coming off of those branches.

458
00:26:05.945 --> 00:26:10.205
But but notice That's an oak tree, right?

459
00:26:13.125 --> 00:26:17.905
It's just in miniature form. That is an oak tree.

460
00:26:17.905 --> 00:26:21.185
It's not a future oak tree that is an oak tree.

461
00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:23.505
Yet you know why God planted that acorn?

462
00:26:26.125 --> 00:26:28.855
Because he intended for a mighty oak.

463
00:26:30.265 --> 00:26:34.915
Because in that half ounce acorn is the potential

464
00:26:35.575 --> 00:26:40.275
for a 30 ton oak tree that spreads its branches wide,

465
00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:44.565
providing shade, providing food for animals, all

466
00:26:44.585 --> 00:26:45.765
of those things.

467
00:26:47.185 --> 00:26:50.645
And over time that little sapling with the right process

468
00:26:51.435 --> 00:26:53.685
will eventually mature

469
00:26:54.225 --> 00:26:56.805
and grow into that 30 ton oak tree.

470
00:27:00.265 --> 00:27:05.225
Same thing in us over time

471
00:27:06.795 --> 00:27:11.405
with God's process, his work in us, we will grow,

472
00:27:11.945 --> 00:27:16.805
we will mature into that strong tree like that

473
00:27:17.175 --> 00:27:19.805
where our, our daily lives begin

474
00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:22.325
to match more like our positional

475
00:27:22.325 --> 00:27:25.195
reality over time.

476
00:27:25.545 --> 00:27:26.715
That happens where,

477
00:27:26.765 --> 00:27:29.115
where you just have at the beginning you have a glimmer

478
00:27:29.115 --> 00:27:33.755
of hope that grows into a full fledged life-giving joy

479
00:27:34.025 --> 00:27:35.755
that lasts through whatever comes your way.

480
00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:41.065
You, you see that you start by just tolerating people

481
00:27:41.285 --> 00:27:43.825
and that grows over time to where you begin

482
00:27:43.825 --> 00:27:45.065
to actually love your enemies.

483
00:27:47.395 --> 00:27:50.535
You have really flaky self-control early in life.

484
00:27:50.595 --> 00:27:54.015
But as you grow into that, it becomes this deep moral

485
00:27:54.775 --> 00:27:56.335
goodness that everybody can see.

486
00:27:58.105 --> 00:27:59.445
That's growth.

487
00:27:59.585 --> 00:28:01.485
And so yes, we need to realize that,

488
00:28:01.595 --> 00:28:05.685
that we don't measure up to Christ's perfect standard.

489
00:28:06.145 --> 00:28:07.525
But here's the question.

490
00:28:07.855 --> 00:28:10.405
Let's start measuring success a little bit differently

491
00:28:10.865 --> 00:28:11.925
by this question.

492
00:28:12.115 --> 00:28:14.765
Like the teacher with the student this time though,

493
00:28:15.185 --> 00:28:16.605
how am I growing?

494
00:28:17.275 --> 00:28:22.175
Just a little bit. We know we don't measure

495
00:28:22.195 --> 00:28:26.735
up, But let the question be this.

496
00:28:29.165 --> 00:28:30.945
How am I actually just growing a little bit?

497
00:28:34.115 --> 00:28:37.005
Because remember that tiny sapling

498
00:28:38.395 --> 00:28:41.915
is an oak tree, right?

499
00:28:41.915 --> 00:28:43.235
We're not saying anything that you have to earn your

500
00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:45.875
salvation or or prove yourself to be sick.

501
00:28:45.975 --> 00:28:47.715
No, that is an oak tree.

502
00:28:49.325 --> 00:28:53.665
And if there are even just buds of leaves on the branches,

503
00:28:54.135 --> 00:28:55.945
that tree is bearing fruit, right?

504
00:28:56.655 --> 00:28:59.185
It's alive, it's bearing fruit. It just looks tiny.

505
00:28:59.335 --> 00:29:01.505
It's a bud right? Now it's not a full fledged like you have

506
00:29:01.505 --> 00:29:03.505
an apple tree that hasn't butted out yet.

507
00:29:03.695 --> 00:29:07.345
It's not full of apples yet. But is there growth happening?

508
00:29:07.925 --> 00:29:11.935
That's the question. It's not whether it looks perfect

509
00:29:12.035 --> 00:29:15.215
or not yet it's is the growth occurring?

510
00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:22.925
So think about your life. Are you

511
00:29:22.925 --> 00:29:26.165
further along in your faith than you were a year ago?

512
00:29:29.595 --> 00:29:33.775
Am I more Christlike today than I was at the age of 25?

513
00:29:36.945 --> 00:29:38.205
And listen, I, I realize

514
00:29:38.265 --> 00:29:40.565
and fully acknowledge regularly to you and to my wife

515
00:29:40.585 --> 00:29:41.805
and to my kids and to everyone.

516
00:29:42.105 --> 00:29:45.165
I'm not perfect yet, but praise God, I'm not where I was.

517
00:29:48.025 --> 00:29:50.855
Can't we can't we realize that we get discouraged

518
00:29:50.975 --> 00:29:52.735
'cause we don't measure up perfectly yet, but,

519
00:29:52.915 --> 00:29:55.495
but look at what God has done.

520
00:29:57.365 --> 00:29:58.455
Look at how he's grown.

521
00:29:58.455 --> 00:30:01.495
You look at how he's moved in your life.

522
00:30:03.505 --> 00:30:05.925
And so that's the question. Are you growing

523
00:30:07.655 --> 00:30:09.545
even in baby step kind of ways?

524
00:30:13.615 --> 00:30:15.515
Are you growing? Do you see the fruit

525
00:30:15.515 --> 00:30:18.475
of the spirit coming out more regularly in your life?

526
00:30:18.475 --> 00:30:20.275
Do you see the Holy Spirit working in you

527
00:30:20.535 --> 00:30:22.795
to grow in your ability to hate what is evil

528
00:30:22.815 --> 00:30:23.875
and clinging to what is good?

529
00:30:23.975 --> 00:30:25.515
Do you see that growing more

530
00:30:26.575 --> 00:30:28.355
as you look over the long period of time?

531
00:30:34.085 --> 00:30:37.485
Now here's the thing about all this, just as true

532
00:30:37.485 --> 00:30:38.565
for you as it is for me.

533
00:30:40.335 --> 00:30:41.435
We come in here every Sunday,

534
00:30:41.655 --> 00:30:42.875
we come in here Wednesday nights,

535
00:30:42.935 --> 00:30:45.595
we do other things at other times with other groups

536
00:30:46.175 --> 00:30:48.035
and we rejoice and sing

537
00:30:48.135 --> 00:30:52.395
and praise God for what he's done to make us

538
00:30:52.995 --> 00:30:54.675
positionally holy before God.

539
00:30:55.985 --> 00:30:58.355
He's justified us, meaning made right with God.

540
00:30:58.625 --> 00:31:01.155
He's made us holy one day He's coming back to take us home.

541
00:31:01.155 --> 00:31:03.195
All that we, we rejoice in the fact

542
00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:04.795
that we will be with him forever.

543
00:31:05.135 --> 00:31:08.475
And that's positional and we rightly rejoice in that.

544
00:31:11.435 --> 00:31:15.575
But progressive holiness here is hard.

545
00:31:19.785 --> 00:31:23.465
Positional holiness is, it's not easy, but it's simple.

546
00:31:23.855 --> 00:31:26.465
It's because of Christ. Praise God for that.

547
00:31:27.225 --> 00:31:29.745
Progressive holiness today is hard

548
00:31:29.745 --> 00:31:33.605
because for the rest of our lives, whether you're old

549
00:31:33.605 --> 00:31:34.925
or whether you're young, for the rest

550
00:31:34.925 --> 00:31:37.765
of our lives there will be a tension between the good

551
00:31:37.985 --> 00:31:40.485
and the evil inside us and around us.

552
00:31:42.015 --> 00:31:44.225
There's always this reality

553
00:31:44.695 --> 00:31:46.905
that there will be times in our lives.

554
00:31:47.485 --> 00:31:50.025
The counterweights don't always go the right way

555
00:31:50.085 --> 00:31:52.585
and there'll be times we grow more than we do at other times

556
00:31:52.585 --> 00:31:55.705
in our lives that will grow less at some times than

557
00:31:55.755 --> 00:31:56.785
other parts of our lives.

558
00:31:57.085 --> 00:31:59.705
The track of holiness in your life is not zero to a hundred

559
00:31:59.885 --> 00:32:02.465
and it's a perfectly vertical like straight

560
00:32:02.535 --> 00:32:03.945
line between the two.

561
00:32:04.205 --> 00:32:06.185
It often looks a whole lot more like this

562
00:32:06.725 --> 00:32:08.025
as you grow in your life.

563
00:32:08.965 --> 00:32:12.345
But the trend is towards holiness.

564
00:32:12.685 --> 00:32:14.465
It just might mean in this week, this month,

565
00:32:14.535 --> 00:32:16.545
this day it's a little bit struggle.

566
00:32:17.765 --> 00:32:21.705
But eventually God grows you and you keep growing over time.

567
00:32:22.005 --> 00:32:23.065
That's the reality.

568
00:32:23.065 --> 00:32:25.545
There will be times that we make more progress.

569
00:32:25.615 --> 00:32:26.785
It's hard, it's a struggle.

570
00:32:26.925 --> 00:32:28.625
But listen, that's not a new problem.

571
00:32:29.735 --> 00:32:30.745
It's not unique to you.

572
00:32:31.365 --> 00:32:33.465
You and I are not the first people to have dealt

573
00:32:33.465 --> 00:32:34.585
with this reality.

574
00:32:36.275 --> 00:32:38.745
We're not facing something that has not been faced before.

575
00:32:39.185 --> 00:32:40.805
Listen to the Apostle Paul,

576
00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:43.725
who the greatest missionary in the world has ever known.

577
00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:49.705
Listen to what he says. Romans 7 21 through 24.

578
00:32:50.885 --> 00:32:54.025
He says, I find it a law that when I want to do right,

579
00:32:54.735 --> 00:32:56.505
evil lies close at hand.

580
00:32:58.205 --> 00:33:01.385
For I delight in my, in the law of God, in my inner being

581
00:33:02.425 --> 00:33:07.265
I want to, but I see in my members the body another law

582
00:33:07.525 --> 00:33:09.465
waging war against the law of my mind

583
00:33:09.485 --> 00:33:11.265
and making me captive to the law of sin

584
00:33:11.265 --> 00:33:14.545
that dwells in my members, wretched man that I am

585
00:33:14.685 --> 00:33:17.745
who will deliver me from this body of death.

586
00:33:19.395 --> 00:33:21.125
Like that's strangely encouraging to me.

587
00:33:21.915 --> 00:33:24.565
This is Paul, like the the great Paul.

588
00:33:24.745 --> 00:33:26.125
And he's saying, man, I'm struggling.

589
00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:29.775
It's hard Because he's honest.

590
00:33:31.375 --> 00:33:35.135
Progressive sanctification is hard. It's a struggle.

591
00:33:35.485 --> 00:33:38.095
It's a constant battle. So how do we fight it?

592
00:33:39.295 --> 00:33:42.385
If we could give up, how do we fight?

593
00:33:45.425 --> 00:33:47.255
Let's remember our foundation today, right?

594
00:33:49.135 --> 00:33:53.185
Remember who you are, Christian, like this is first.

595
00:33:53.745 --> 00:33:57.905
Remember that because Jesus was sinless, that

596
00:33:58.125 --> 00:34:02.225
by his death he has made you holy as well.

597
00:34:03.265 --> 00:34:05.065
I guess what he did, he's made you that.

598
00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:07.025
It's not that you could earn it.

599
00:34:07.175 --> 00:34:09.145
He's given you a new nature, a new identity.

600
00:34:09.445 --> 00:34:11.145
One that naturally recoils from

601
00:34:11.145 --> 00:34:13.825
what doesn't match his character.

602
00:34:15.175 --> 00:34:17.025
He's made you different.

603
00:34:17.565 --> 00:34:20.305
You are different in him.

604
00:34:20.765 --> 00:34:22.745
And then driven by that grace,

605
00:34:25.305 --> 00:34:28.885
we are then to give every effort to grow in our hatred

606
00:34:28.945 --> 00:34:30.645
of evil pursuing godliness.

607
00:34:30.785 --> 00:34:34.565
That's then what we do in response to his grace.

608
00:34:36.515 --> 00:34:40.605
Okay? So how do we do that? Well, don't overcomplicate this.

609
00:34:43.045 --> 00:34:44.745
Let me just give you a simple way to think about this.

610
00:34:44.765 --> 00:34:47.185
How do I grow in this ability to hate what was evil

611
00:34:47.205 --> 00:34:48.385
and and clinging to what is good?

612
00:34:48.385 --> 00:34:50.105
How do I do that? Lemme just give you a simple way.

613
00:34:51.475 --> 00:34:53.345
Think about the things you do in life.

614
00:34:53.345 --> 00:34:55.705
Think about pursue, watch, whatever.

615
00:34:57.425 --> 00:35:01.245
If we wanna grow in this, just do less of the things

616
00:35:01.755 --> 00:35:04.925
that steal your affections from Christ

617
00:35:06.495 --> 00:35:10.035
and do more of the things that stir your affections

618
00:35:10.175 --> 00:35:14.235
for Christ, right?

619
00:35:14.235 --> 00:35:18.015
Think about that. Do less of the things

620
00:35:18.085 --> 00:35:19.455
that steal your heart

621
00:35:19.455 --> 00:35:21.895
and your affections away from the Lord.

622
00:35:22.135 --> 00:35:24.135
Whatever that is in your life. Maybe it's video games

623
00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:26.775
or maybe it's this person in your relationship

624
00:35:26.835 --> 00:35:28.335
or maybe it's lust

625
00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:30.215
or maybe it's greed or maybe it's whatever else.

626
00:35:30.275 --> 00:35:33.495
And like I pursue it that way. Do less of that stuff.

627
00:35:35.225 --> 00:35:36.505
'cause what that does is steals you

628
00:35:36.505 --> 00:35:37.645
heart away from the Lord.

629
00:35:37.705 --> 00:35:41.895
Do less of that, but do more

630
00:35:42.435 --> 00:35:45.535
of the things that stir your affections for Jesus.

631
00:35:45.715 --> 00:35:48.055
The things that are going to increase your love,

632
00:35:48.055 --> 00:35:50.495
that stir your heart to follow him.

633
00:35:50.495 --> 00:35:52.535
More. Like worship together with your brothers

634
00:35:52.535 --> 00:35:55.215
and sisters, reading his word and discovering who Christ is.

635
00:35:55.475 --> 00:35:58.415
You're seeing man this time with my kids or

636
00:35:58.515 --> 00:35:59.935
or nature in this way.

637
00:35:59.985 --> 00:36:02.815
Those are things that stir my affections for Jesus.

638
00:36:03.075 --> 00:36:06.245
And so I wanna do more of that and do less of other stuff.

639
00:36:07.805 --> 00:36:08.995
Don't overcomplicate this.

640
00:36:10.345 --> 00:36:11.755
Just think about everything you do,

641
00:36:11.755 --> 00:36:13.675
everything you think about, everything you want to do

642
00:36:13.975 --> 00:36:17.235
and say, does that stir my affection for Jesus

643
00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:18.715
or steal it away

644
00:36:20.325 --> 00:36:22.665
and then make a decision based on that.

645
00:36:26.775 --> 00:36:31.085
But again, don't forget that this desire to hate evil

646
00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:32.725
and submit yourself to what is good.

647
00:36:32.785 --> 00:36:35.885
Romans seven said it's gonna be a struggle at times.

648
00:36:36.505 --> 00:36:37.925
It will be a struggle.

649
00:36:38.025 --> 00:36:39.645
And so you have to make a decision at times.

650
00:36:39.805 --> 00:36:40.885
I have to make a decision at times.

651
00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:43.365
Am I going to obey God even when it's hard?

652
00:36:46.595 --> 00:36:47.975
That's why we can't forget this truth.

653
00:36:49.415 --> 00:36:53.785
Deuteronomy 10 13 says this, that that all that God commands

654
00:36:54.085 --> 00:36:56.545
for us is for our good.

655
00:36:59.765 --> 00:37:02.905
See, God's not up there as a cosmic killjoy just

656
00:37:02.905 --> 00:37:04.065
saying, you can't have any fun.

657
00:37:04.185 --> 00:37:05.505
I just want you to follow all the rules.

658
00:37:05.565 --> 00:37:10.055
That's not what God's like God is saying, I designed life

659
00:37:10.275 --> 00:37:12.055
to work the best way this way.

660
00:37:12.235 --> 00:37:14.375
If you wanna flourish, here's how you live your life.

661
00:37:14.475 --> 00:37:16.375
And so we follow that. We obey that.

662
00:37:16.435 --> 00:37:18.255
That's where life is actually the best.

663
00:37:21.115 --> 00:37:22.335
And so he's not trying

664
00:37:22.355 --> 00:37:25.375
to keep us down When we hold what's good

665
00:37:25.675 --> 00:37:29.895
and we eliminate what's evil, we align with his character

666
00:37:30.075 --> 00:37:31.575
that's gonna be good for us.

667
00:37:33.315 --> 00:37:34.735
But I'm not gonna get to do what they do.

668
00:37:34.755 --> 00:37:37.855
I'm not gonna get to experience that He's got what's better

669
00:37:37.995 --> 00:37:41.915
for you if you just listen and obey.

670
00:37:42.175 --> 00:37:45.315
He will lead you towards the goodness of it.

671
00:37:45.375 --> 00:37:47.715
So those are ways we fight. Those are ways we fight.

672
00:37:48.305 --> 00:37:52.895
Stay in it because there's one more way.

673
00:37:52.895 --> 00:37:55.655
We fight through this tension we feel daily in our lives.

674
00:37:57.885 --> 00:38:00.345
And this may be one of the most important reasons.

675
00:38:00.525 --> 00:38:04.105
Do you remember, remember how Romans 7 24 ended?

676
00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:05.825
I just read it a second ago.

677
00:38:07.735 --> 00:38:10.435
He, he said, wretched man that I am

678
00:38:11.735 --> 00:38:13.755
who will deliver me from this body of death.

679
00:38:16.125 --> 00:38:18.145
You feel that one, right? Like some of you feel that.

680
00:38:18.305 --> 00:38:19.385
I feel that in my soul.

681
00:38:19.385 --> 00:38:21.625
Like go man, I'm time's

682
00:38:21.625 --> 00:38:24.025
wretched God, just get me outta here.

683
00:38:24.025 --> 00:38:26.425
Like I'm ready for this to be done. Get outta here.

684
00:38:26.465 --> 00:38:27.665
I I just wanna be gone.

685
00:38:30.595 --> 00:38:33.725
That is not the cry of a desperate man.

686
00:38:34.395 --> 00:38:38.125
When Paul says that that is

687
00:38:38.925 --> 00:38:41.325
a cry that's actually full of hope

688
00:38:41.435 --> 00:38:42.885
because he's not asking that

689
00:38:42.885 --> 00:38:43.925
because he doesn't know the answer.

690
00:38:44.195 --> 00:38:47.085
He's asking that rhetorically to set up what he's about

691
00:38:47.085 --> 00:38:48.605
to say in verse 25.

692
00:38:48.855 --> 00:38:50.285
Who's gonna deliver me Verse 25.

693
00:38:50.545 --> 00:38:53.165
Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

694
00:38:54.585 --> 00:38:57.285
He knew the answer. He just like, God,

695
00:38:57.325 --> 00:38:58.645
I wanna cry this out to you.

696
00:38:58.985 --> 00:39:01.245
Thanks be to God that you are going

697
00:39:01.245 --> 00:39:02.805
to deliver me that believer.

698
00:39:03.075 --> 00:39:05.725
That is our ability to stand firm today.

699
00:39:06.065 --> 00:39:08.365
It hinges on the fact that we have a God who's

700
00:39:08.365 --> 00:39:10.845
with us in the battle, who has already won the battle

701
00:39:11.065 --> 00:39:14.605
and is one day coming back to deliver us from all the evil

702
00:39:14.605 --> 00:39:15.805
that we battle every day.

703
00:39:16.865 --> 00:39:20.485
The evil inside us, the evil around us one day is coming.

704
00:39:20.715 --> 00:39:22.645
He's going to deliver us.

705
00:39:22.785 --> 00:39:25.765
That's what makes it easier today to hate what is evil,

706
00:39:25.945 --> 00:39:26.965
to cling to what is good.

707
00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:29.845
Because we know that some days coming, we won't have

708
00:39:29.845 --> 00:39:31.325
to struggle anymore.

709
00:39:32.585 --> 00:39:34.365
That's what I love about Philippians one, six.

710
00:39:34.635 --> 00:39:39.285
Yeah, one of my favorite verses is Philippians one, six.

711
00:39:39.525 --> 00:39:41.445
I am sure of this, that he

712
00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:44.845
who began a good work in you will bring it

713
00:39:44.845 --> 00:39:46.965
to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.

714
00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:50.005
He started the sanctification,

715
00:39:50.225 --> 00:39:52.925
the holiness work in you when you believed.

716
00:39:53.105 --> 00:39:55.365
But he's working it all out to bring it

717
00:39:55.365 --> 00:39:58.885
to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.

718
00:39:59.075 --> 00:40:02.365
He's realigning you even today towards that standard.

719
00:40:02.625 --> 00:40:05.805
But one day's coming when we'll be fully aligned to it.

720
00:40:08.865 --> 00:40:10.125
And so what do we do until then?

721
00:40:13.865 --> 00:40:15.485
We lay aside every weight

722
00:40:16.025 --> 00:40:18.965
and sin that so easily entangles us

723
00:40:20.825 --> 00:40:23.565
and we run with endurance the race

724
00:40:23.565 --> 00:40:24.805
that is marked out for us.

725
00:40:26.025 --> 00:40:29.005
Fixing our eyes on our prize.

726
00:40:29.695 --> 00:40:33.005
Jesus, He's the finish line.

727
00:40:34.785 --> 00:40:37.765
He just brings this full holiness with him when he comes.

728
00:40:39.905 --> 00:40:41.565
That's our hope. So let me invite you

729
00:40:41.565 --> 00:40:43.085
to close your eyes with me for a moment.

730
00:40:44.405 --> 00:40:45.485
I said, we're gonna do this

731
00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:48.165
before to just take these questions

732
00:40:48.165 --> 00:40:50.405
and reflect on them for a few moments here.

733
00:40:56.985 --> 00:40:59.365
If you've ever wondered whether God would answer prayer,

734
00:40:59.555 --> 00:41:02.885
this is one he will make very clear.

735
00:41:06.635 --> 00:41:08.525
When you ask God, search me

736
00:41:08.545 --> 00:41:13.005
and see if there's any wicked way in me, he will show you.

737
00:41:16.505 --> 00:41:20.525
And so that question of am I compromising just a little bit?

738
00:41:22.705 --> 00:41:26.365
Ask yourself that and

739
00:41:26.385 --> 00:41:31.045
and just don't, don't run to the love

740
00:41:31.045 --> 00:41:33.085
of God and the forgiveness of God too quickly.

741
00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:38.805
Sit in this because we are so prone to self-deception.

742
00:41:42.465 --> 00:41:43.485
And so sit in this

743
00:41:43.485 --> 00:41:46.205
and just say, God, where am I

744
00:41:46.285 --> 00:41:47.685
compromising Just a little bit.

745
00:41:48.095 --> 00:41:50.485
Where am I allowing things in my life that are not of you?

746
00:41:50.485 --> 00:41:52.845
Where am I just being content and

747
00:41:52.945 --> 00:41:56.645
and satisfied to have all this junk in there?

748
00:41:57.065 --> 00:41:58.885
Why God show me

749
00:42:03.745 --> 00:42:08.045
and God give me a hatred, a holy hatred of it.

750
00:42:13.545 --> 00:42:14.845
So much so that I avoid it.

751
00:42:20.105 --> 00:42:24.205
And Lord, I pray that as we reflect on that, as

752
00:42:24.205 --> 00:42:27.885
as you spend the next few minutes and hours and days

753
00:42:27.985 --> 00:42:31.445
and weeks and and we're that that pebble is in our shoe

754
00:42:31.445 --> 00:42:32.565
and we can't get away from it of

755
00:42:32.565 --> 00:42:34.085
how we're compromising just a little bit.

756
00:42:34.715 --> 00:42:38.885
Lord, that you in that also draw us back to your love

757
00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:43.565
and how you have already forgiven us,

758
00:42:43.565 --> 00:42:46.605
already made us holy positionally in Christ

759
00:42:49.515 --> 00:42:51.725
that we can't sin too much.

760
00:42:54.865 --> 00:42:58.805
But Lord, I pray that we would so be transformed,

761
00:42:58.915 --> 00:43:02.485
that we would grow in hating sin more,

762
00:43:02.485 --> 00:43:04.445
that we would grow in our obedience

763
00:43:04.445 --> 00:43:07.685
to you more we would grow as we look to you

764
00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:09.965
and submit to your work in our lives,

765
00:43:09.965 --> 00:43:12.565
that we look more like Jesus tomorrow than we did today.

766
00:43:13.865 --> 00:43:15.405
At five years from now, we'd look back

767
00:43:15.405 --> 00:43:17.045
and say, wow, God, what you've done

768
00:43:20.585 --> 00:43:23.645
yet, looking forward to the day you return

769
00:43:23.745 --> 00:43:25.125
and finish the work.

770
00:43:27.715 --> 00:43:29.445
Lord, give us strength. May everyone in this room,

771
00:43:30.005 --> 00:43:33.245
everyone watching online, may we all have a renewed sense

772
00:43:33.665 --> 00:43:35.285
of your victory over sin

773
00:43:35.665 --> 00:43:40.325
and your gift of the ability for us to walk that out today.

774
00:43:43.575 --> 00:43:45.165
You'd free people from the chains

775
00:43:45.545 --> 00:43:47.965
of darkness to walk in the light.

776
00:43:48.185 --> 00:43:53.085
God, do that. Do that among us. It's not us, God, it's you.

777
00:43:53.185 --> 00:43:57.485
So may we worship you now. In Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.

778
00:43:57.485 --> 00:43:58.005
Let's stand together.
