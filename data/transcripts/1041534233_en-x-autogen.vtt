00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:03.725
The one who is the true light, who gives light

2
00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:05.765
to everyone was coming into the world,

3
00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:27.795
he was in the world and the world was made through him.

4
00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:29.755
But who was this light?

5
00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:37.155
He was and is God with us?

6
00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:43.495
So let me explain.

7
00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.535
Had somebody asked me if I lost my

8
00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:51.855
fantasy football league or something?

9
00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:53.975
No, actually won mine.

10
00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:58.135
Um, so our family life team

11
00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:01.655
last week had a Christmas party

12
00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:04.215
with all the volunteers or students and kids.

13
00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:06.535
Everybody works with them. And they had a contest

14
00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:10.775
called an ugly Sweater Decorating Contest where the prize

15
00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:14.255
for the winning team was

16
00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:16.815
that I wear it on this Sunday before Christmas.

17
00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:20.135
So yeah, here we are.

18
00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.775
Uh, they had to incorporate the table number

19
00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:26.575
that they were sitting at as well.

20
00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:28.175
So on the ninth day of Christmas,

21
00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:29.655
we had nine elders praying.

22
00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:33.575
So yeah, uh, if you're new here,

23
00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:35.255
it's not always like this, okay?

24
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:38.455
Uh, I do normally wear a Christmas suit on Sunday

25
00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:39.535
before Christmas.

26
00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:41.695
But um, let's just say we don't take ourselves

27
00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:42.735
very seriously around here.

28
00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.535
We take Jesus very seriously, but we can laugh

29
00:01:45.915 --> 00:01:48.535
and have a good time along the way towards that end, okay?

30
00:01:48.915 --> 00:01:51.735
So, uh, if you, well by the way,

31
00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:54.535
I just hope I don't turn into forkey, uh,

32
00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:57.335
where things just start falling off as I'm preaching.

33
00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:00.775
Like, 'cause this has already been some things lost.

34
00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:03.615
So just, we'll just move on. All right?

35
00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:04.615
Anyway, if you're not already there,

36
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:06.335
take your copy of God's word.

37
00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.535
Turn with me to the book of John, the gospel

38
00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:11.455
of John chapter one.

39
00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:14.585
As we're working through this month,

40
00:02:14.595 --> 00:02:16.425
we've been focused on the biblical word,

41
00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:17.945
Emmanuel, what we just saying?

42
00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:23.065
That idea that God is with us, that word looks at

43
00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:26.265
who he is and we've been building that idea as we go

44
00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:28.265
through this journey in John chapter one.

45
00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:33.185
But who is this God who came to be with us?

46
00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:37.675
Who is the God who gives life the word

47
00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:39.115
that gives life the word

48
00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:40.795
that shines a light into the darkness?

49
00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:45.185
Who is that? The one who came to save? Who actually is that?

50
00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.865
Well, this last section of the introduction of John

51
00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:51.745
verses one through 18, it it culminates

52
00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:53.825
this last section verses 14

53
00:02:53.825 --> 00:02:56.985
through 18 culminates the description of Jesus,

54
00:02:57.175 --> 00:02:59.365
this God the Son taken on flesh.

55
00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:03.965
We saw that he is now not only life, he is not only light.

56
00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:07.325
What we'll see today is that he is also grace and truth.

57
00:03:08.705 --> 00:03:10.525
He is grace and truth.

58
00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:13.045
And so I'm gonna read the whole section verses one

59
00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:15.765
through 18 we've been building to this point

60
00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:18.605
where eternity past leads to

61
00:03:18.795 --> 00:03:20.765
what we saw him do back then.

62
00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.205
What did he do when he shows up?

63
00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:26.685
Look at what these 18 verses teach us about God.

64
00:03:28.815 --> 00:03:32.355
In the beginning was the word and the word was with God

65
00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:33.435
and the word was God.

66
00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:36.475
He was in the beginning with God.

67
00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:38.995
All things were made through him.

68
00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:42.275
And without him was not anything made that was made

69
00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:47.325
in him was life and the life was the light of men.

70
00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:49.965
The light shines in the darkness

71
00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:51.925
and the darkness has not overcome it.

72
00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:56.005
There was a man sent from God whose name was John.

73
00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:58.805
He came as a witness to bear witness about the light

74
00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:00.525
that all might believe through him.

75
00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:02.445
He was not the light,

76
00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:04.485
but he came to bear witness about the light,

77
00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:06.905
the true light which gives light

78
00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:08.585
to everyone was coming into the world.

79
00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:11.185
He was in the world and the world was made through him.

80
00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:13.065
Yet the world did not know him.

81
00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:17.365
He came to his own and his own people did not receive him,

82
00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:21.325
but to all who did receive him, who believed in his name,

83
00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:23.445
he gave the right to become children of God

84
00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:26.725
who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,

85
00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:29.445
nor of the will of man, but born of God.

86
00:04:31.425 --> 00:04:35.405
And the word became flesh and dwelt among us.

87
00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:38.965
And we have seen His glory, glory as

88
00:04:38.965 --> 00:04:42.365
of the only son from the Father full of grace and truth.

89
00:04:43.745 --> 00:04:45.715
John bore witness about him and cried out.

90
00:04:45.745 --> 00:04:48.915
This was he of whom I said, he who comes after me, ranks

91
00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:50.875
before me because he was before me.

92
00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:56.355
For from his fullness, we have all received grace upon grace

93
00:04:57.475 --> 00:04:59.015
for the law was given through Moses.

94
00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:01.655
Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

95
00:05:02.955 --> 00:05:05.415
No one has ever seen God, the only God

96
00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:06.655
who is at the father's side.

97
00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:10.695
He has made him known God.

98
00:05:10.695 --> 00:05:13.935
This is your beautiful powerful word

99
00:05:15.165 --> 00:05:18.335
showing us about the word God, the Son.

100
00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:23.295
Jesus made flesh. And so God, give us a picture today.

101
00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:25.815
I pray that our hearts would be stirred in

102
00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:27.415
affection for you.

103
00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:29.015
That we would realize

104
00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:30.895
that this is not just business as usual.

105
00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:33.415
Christmas is not just sentimentality.

106
00:05:33.815 --> 00:05:37.535
Christmas means you, God came to be known

107
00:05:39.175 --> 00:05:41.235
and we would recognize and believe

108
00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:44.315
and worship you with everything we are as a result of that.

109
00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:49.115
Show us today, God, what you want us to know and believe

110
00:05:49.735 --> 00:05:53.135
and act upon for your glory.

111
00:05:54.015 --> 00:05:55.715
In Jesus' name, amen.

112
00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:01.325
So when you're reading the Bible, one solid principle of how

113
00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:04.125
to interpret the Bible is to look for repeated words.

114
00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:06.325
And you see that a couple times here.

115
00:06:06.325 --> 00:06:07.725
It tends to show an emphasis on

116
00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:10.365
what God's spirit is wanting us to know and recognize

117
00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:11.605
and understand here.

118
00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:12.605
Well we zoom in

119
00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:16.325
to these five verses specifically we see a word repeated

120
00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:18.645
two times in verse 14.

121
00:06:18.675 --> 00:06:20.485
It's implied in a few other spots, but,

122
00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:22.085
but verse 14 has it twice.

123
00:06:22.155 --> 00:06:26.985
It's the word glory, which in the original Greek language

124
00:06:27.005 --> 00:06:28.785
you see that word on the screen.

125
00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:33.785
The the word is dsa and that word means fame or recognition

126
00:06:33.925 --> 00:06:37.225
or prestige or giving honor to someone

127
00:06:37.405 --> 00:06:40.025
or something enhancing the honor.

128
00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:42.105
You might have heard the big word doxology.

129
00:06:43.045 --> 00:06:46.505
Uh, it's a similar word used in in uh, the church a lot

130
00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:49.625
where it's the study of worship, the practice of worship

131
00:06:49.635 --> 00:06:53.905
where we're giving honor to the Lord, we're glorifying God.

132
00:06:54.005 --> 00:06:56.865
That's doxology coming from that word, doxa,

133
00:06:56.865 --> 00:06:58.385
which is glory right here.

134
00:06:58.445 --> 00:07:01.225
But that that concept's not just repeated in verse 14,

135
00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:02.585
twice it even shows up.

136
00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:07.785
Verse 15, John talks about the ranking of this word

137
00:07:08.215 --> 00:07:09.465
that he's been talking about the whole time.

138
00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:12.665
Then verse 18, John talks about the only God.

139
00:07:13.005 --> 00:07:16.345
That's a phrase that's often tied with God's glory.

140
00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:20.575
And so we'll get to some other repeated words in a moment.

141
00:07:20.675 --> 00:07:21.735
But the thread running

142
00:07:21.735 --> 00:07:25.135
through the section here is clearly the notion of glory,

143
00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:28.815
glory that's tied to the word

144
00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.535
that he's been talking about since verse one,

145
00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:33.735
the word and glory.

146
00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:36.815
So each of our points today is gonna fill out this

147
00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:38.095
picture of glory.

148
00:07:39.215 --> 00:07:41.885
It'll teach us about God, who he is and what he's done.

149
00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:45.125
And first we start right off in verse 14, with

150
00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:50.115
that glory incarnate, glory incarnate.

151
00:07:52.135 --> 00:07:55.195
You again may not understand that word, but just look at it.

152
00:07:55.215 --> 00:07:57.395
You carnivore, you've heard that

153
00:07:57.395 --> 00:08:01.275
before of flesh eaters, uh, that's talking about body

154
00:08:01.455 --> 00:08:04.435
and so incarnate in fleshed

155
00:08:05.995 --> 00:08:07.495
the word became flesh.

156
00:08:07.495 --> 00:08:09.655
Look at that again. Verse 14, just the first part

157
00:08:11.235 --> 00:08:15.695
and the word, that same word from verse one became flesh

158
00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.375
and dwelt among us.

159
00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:22.775
The word God that we've seen already became flesh.

160
00:08:23.005 --> 00:08:27.095
Only five words yet packed with meaning.

161
00:08:29.195 --> 00:08:33.135
And John intentionally said it this way to counteract one

162
00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:37.655
of the dominant heresies At the time there was a heresy

163
00:08:37.655 --> 00:08:40.695
that said that the physical body itself was bad.

164
00:08:41.295 --> 00:08:42.935
Spiritual things are good. The physical body,

165
00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:44.215
you need to be freed from it.

166
00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.045
And what does John do here?

167
00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:51.075
John pictures God's view of the body here

168
00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:55.035
by saying the body is a key part of you as a person.

169
00:08:55.705 --> 00:08:58.405
It itself also needs to be redeemed,

170
00:08:58.825 --> 00:09:00.405
not just your spiritual side.

171
00:09:02.045 --> 00:09:04.705
If Jesus didn't need, if if, if God didn't need

172
00:09:04.705 --> 00:09:06.425
to redeem the body, Jesus would've just come

173
00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:07.625
as some kind of spirit form.

174
00:09:08.445 --> 00:09:09.785
But he came as a body.

175
00:09:09.785 --> 00:09:13.115
He came in a body and and here's the truth.

176
00:09:13.265 --> 00:09:15.115
This might be a little bit of a a

177
00:09:15.115 --> 00:09:16.355
difference than you've heard before.

178
00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:19.115
He didn't just enter into a man's body

179
00:09:20.135 --> 00:09:21.665
that was another heresy at the time.

180
00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:25.785
It says clearly he took on flesh,

181
00:09:26.615 --> 00:09:30.905
meaning he added a human nature already to his divine nature

182
00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:36.105
so that he could dwell among us.

183
00:09:37.765 --> 00:09:41.985
And that word for dwelt is really an interesting word here

184
00:09:41.985 --> 00:09:44.305
because it's the same word used in the Old Testament

185
00:09:44.305 --> 00:09:45.825
for the word tabernacle.

186
00:09:46.675 --> 00:09:49.885
That was God's dwelling place among his people

187
00:09:50.265 --> 00:09:51.485
as they wandered through the wilderness.

188
00:09:51.485 --> 00:09:52.885
And once they even planted in the land,

189
00:09:52.985 --> 00:09:55.325
it was God's dwelling place.

190
00:09:55.665 --> 00:09:59.995
So the word literally added on a human nature.

191
00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:01.435
He became flesh.

192
00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:04.575
He tabernacled among us

193
00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:08.205
to bring his presence to his people.

194
00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:11.765
That's the whole meaning of Christmas.

195
00:10:11.765 --> 00:10:15.965
By the way, see, God the Son

196
00:10:16.955 --> 00:10:21.365
took on flesh and became a baby born in Bethlehem.

197
00:10:22.415 --> 00:10:25.595
That's what we mean when we say glory talking about God.

198
00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.115
Glory incarnate,

199
00:10:28.445 --> 00:10:30.995
glory made flesh the incarnation

200
00:10:31.215 --> 00:10:32.555
and that's what we have seen.

201
00:10:32.655 --> 00:10:35.315
We couldn't see it otherwise, but that's what it says.

202
00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:40.115
We have seen His glory as a result of the incarnation,

203
00:10:42.045 --> 00:10:44.715
which is the next piece here about this glory.

204
00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:47.875
We see glory incarnate, but then we see glory revealed.

205
00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:51.425
This glory has been revealed

206
00:10:51.805 --> 00:10:55.545
to us again.

207
00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:59.625
Verse 14, watch this and the word became flesh

208
00:11:00.165 --> 00:11:03.705
and dwelt among us and we have seen His glory.

209
00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:06.705
Glory as of the only son

210
00:11:06.765 --> 00:11:10.985
or the only begotten you might say from the Father full

211
00:11:10.985 --> 00:11:12.385
of grace and truth.

212
00:11:13.655 --> 00:11:16.185
This is Trinitarian language all over this,

213
00:11:17.445 --> 00:11:19.025
but it's not the first time.

214
00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:22.425
It's not the only time John 17 five,

215
00:11:22.555 --> 00:11:24.505
Jesus himself is praying to the Father.

216
00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:27.985
He says, glorify me in your own presence

217
00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:31.425
with the glory I had with you before the world existed.

218
00:11:33.335 --> 00:11:35.435
So the Father and the Son, I know it's complicated,

219
00:11:35.575 --> 00:11:39.955
but Jesus himself understood this, that the glory is part

220
00:11:39.955 --> 00:11:41.075
of just being God.

221
00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:46.345
And it says here in verse 14, we've seen the glory of God.

222
00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:51.615
Well how did we see it? Well, it's by the word

223
00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:54.045
becoming flesh and dwelling among us.

224
00:11:55.585 --> 00:12:00.005
We see the glory of God through Jesus Christ himself.

225
00:12:02.535 --> 00:12:03.795
And here's why this is so important

226
00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:07.915
because Romans one says there are aspects about God

227
00:12:07.915 --> 00:12:10.515
that we can learn through creation,

228
00:12:11.585 --> 00:12:13.635
that we can understand a little bit about

229
00:12:13.655 --> 00:12:16.435
who God is on its own creation itself.

230
00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:18.235
De declares the glory of God,

231
00:12:19.015 --> 00:12:21.075
but we cannot know his character

232
00:12:21.805 --> 00:12:23.055
just by looking at creation.

233
00:12:25.565 --> 00:12:27.745
See, unless God showed us

234
00:12:27.805 --> 00:12:30.685
who he is, we wouldn't understand.

235
00:12:31.145 --> 00:12:34.325
We wouldn't fully understand who God is

236
00:12:34.345 --> 00:12:35.805
and understand his glory.

237
00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:39.605
He had to create a way for us to understand.

238
00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:42.285
He had to know how we, we had to know

239
00:12:42.285 --> 00:12:46.165
through some way we could understand And what does it say?

240
00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:48.525
We learn about this glory, this glory revealed.

241
00:12:48.525 --> 00:12:53.305
What do we learn about it? It says He's full of grace

242
00:12:53.325 --> 00:12:55.885
and truth, right?

243
00:12:55.885 --> 00:12:59.965
He said that at in verse 14, full of grace and truth.

244
00:13:00.015 --> 00:13:02.685
Those are also words repeated in this section.

245
00:13:02.745 --> 00:13:07.095
If you notice that grace is said, uh, truth is said twice,

246
00:13:07.275 --> 00:13:11.455
but grace is used four times in just these five verses.

247
00:13:13.505 --> 00:13:16.165
So again, repeated words mean we should pay attention.

248
00:13:16.305 --> 00:13:18.285
In fact, look again at verse 16, how

249
00:13:18.285 --> 00:13:20.165
that verse talks about grace.

250
00:13:21.465 --> 00:13:24.605
It says for from his the word become flesh

251
00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:25.965
from his fullness.

252
00:13:26.425 --> 00:13:29.845
We have all received grace upon grace.

253
00:13:31.485 --> 00:13:36.245
Isn't that interesting that word for fullness,

254
00:13:36.345 --> 00:13:38.085
it means something like the sum total

255
00:13:38.305 --> 00:13:40.005
or everything it ever could be.

256
00:13:41.345 --> 00:13:43.765
All that it brings with it it it's there.

257
00:13:44.145 --> 00:13:47.685
And the word here is the fullness, the fullness of the word.

258
00:13:47.825 --> 00:13:52.355
It says distributes things here.

259
00:13:52.785 --> 00:13:55.305
Good gifts like grace,

260
00:13:56.785 --> 00:14:00.075
like when the word specifically when the word was revealed,

261
00:14:00.695 --> 00:14:01.915
the fullness of the word,

262
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:05.635
his fullness brought us grace, right?

263
00:14:05.635 --> 00:14:08.195
So the fullness of grace, that is the glory revealed the

264
00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:10.275
fullness of grace came with him.

265
00:14:13.785 --> 00:14:16.035
Look at that phrase again at the end of verse 16.

266
00:14:16.495 --> 00:14:19.835
Here's how my translation says it, grace upon grace,

267
00:14:21.205 --> 00:14:24.235
maybe your translation says something different, but

268
00:14:24.335 --> 00:14:26.315
but grace upon grace, what?

269
00:14:26.315 --> 00:14:28.755
What that means is that grace replaces grace.

270
00:14:28.775 --> 00:14:30.395
You kinda layering it like a cake.

271
00:14:30.605 --> 00:14:32.795
Grace upon grace, upon grace, upon grace.

272
00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:34.955
Maybe yours says grace, for grace.

273
00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:37.635
That means if you would take one of them away, you get this.

274
00:14:37.785 --> 00:14:38.795
Well, it's the same thing.

275
00:14:38.935 --> 00:14:40.235
You take grace away, you get grace.

276
00:14:40.345 --> 00:14:43.675
It's just repeated over and over. I love this translation.

277
00:14:44.135 --> 00:14:46.355
One gracious blessing after another.

278
00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:50.475
And so you see what this is saying to us, right?

279
00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:55.285
When the word the glory revealed himself,

280
00:14:56.665 --> 00:15:01.445
the fullness he brought was grace upon grace,

281
00:15:01.955 --> 00:15:03.445
upon grace, upon grace.

282
00:15:05.915 --> 00:15:07.845
This is not just a New Testament principle.

283
00:15:07.845 --> 00:15:12.445
Listen to this in the Old Testament, Lamentations 3 22

284
00:15:12.445 --> 00:15:16.045
and 23 says the steadfast love, that's the covenant love

285
00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:18.405
of the Lord never ceases.

286
00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:21.565
His mercies never come to an end.

287
00:15:22.035 --> 00:15:24.525
They are new every morning.

288
00:15:25.755 --> 00:15:29.525
Great is your faithfulness like

289
00:15:29.655 --> 00:15:34.595
that sun comes up every morning, day upon day upon day,

290
00:15:35.165 --> 00:15:37.195
grace upon grace in the Old Testament,

291
00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:40.075
mercy upon mercy upon mercy every day.

292
00:15:41.515 --> 00:15:43.735
That's the truth of the fullness.

293
00:15:44.055 --> 00:15:47.335
Bringing with it the glory of God revealed in Christ

294
00:15:48.495 --> 00:15:53.125
means we received the fullness of grace when he showed up.

295
00:15:53.155 --> 00:15:54.885
It's like a bubbling spring, right?

296
00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:58.605
An infinite spring of grace just constantly bubbling up

297
00:15:58.665 --> 00:16:00.205
and bubbling up and bubbling up.

298
00:16:00.425 --> 00:16:02.485
Or you might think in this time of the year,

299
00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:04.485
you might think it's like an escalator where

300
00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:06.565
that star just keeps coming and coming

301
00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:08.325
and coming and coming, right?

302
00:16:08.325 --> 00:16:11.965
It just keeps going. It never ends.

303
00:16:12.425 --> 00:16:15.765
The sum total of all the grace

304
00:16:16.115 --> 00:16:19.885
that there ever could be is found in Jesus Christ.

305
00:16:21.805 --> 00:16:24.145
The glory revealed the fullness of grace.

306
00:16:24.565 --> 00:16:27.225
We get grace upon grace. Why is that?

307
00:16:27.225 --> 00:16:29.905
Because he himself is full of grace.

308
00:16:30.605 --> 00:16:32.385
He is grace itself.

309
00:16:32.465 --> 00:16:34.185
I mean, just think about a, a wet sponge.

310
00:16:36.005 --> 00:16:38.255
When you squeeze a wet sponge, what comes out of it?

311
00:16:40.665 --> 00:16:44.665
I know I heard water. If water's in the sponge right,

312
00:16:45.525 --> 00:16:46.745
you could fill it with Kool-Aid

313
00:16:46.745 --> 00:16:47.985
and it comes out Kool-Aid, right?

314
00:16:47.985 --> 00:16:50.465
That's the idea. Whatever is inside of it,

315
00:16:50.825 --> 00:16:53.545
whatever it's full of, you squeeze it, it comes out

316
00:16:55.875 --> 00:16:57.655
the fullness of grace.

317
00:16:59.215 --> 00:17:04.005
Jesus being full of grace means it just flows out of him

318
00:17:06.465 --> 00:17:07.795
from his fullness.

319
00:17:09.015 --> 00:17:11.995
We have received grace upon grace.

320
00:17:14.515 --> 00:17:18.735
That means there's no limit no matter

321
00:17:18.885 --> 00:17:19.975
what you have done.

322
00:17:21.075 --> 00:17:25.375
There's no limit grace upon grace upon grace,

323
00:17:29.365 --> 00:17:33.075
but that glory revealed it wasn't just full of grace, right?

324
00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:38.395
Did you see it? Verse 14 says, he is full

325
00:17:38.415 --> 00:17:40.275
of grace and truth.

326
00:17:42.165 --> 00:17:46.755
Verse 17, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

327
00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.445
And so he's the fullness of grace

328
00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:53.785
and he is the fullness of truth.

329
00:17:56.445 --> 00:17:58.825
So the glory revealed brought grace

330
00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.985
and truth in its fullness.

331
00:18:03.845 --> 00:18:07.065
Now that word truth here means the content of what is true.

332
00:18:07.285 --> 00:18:10.825
And we kind of understand that inherently not true based on

333
00:18:10.825 --> 00:18:12.905
what you or I think about the situation,

334
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.985
but true based on the standard of truth, Jesus,

335
00:18:17.705 --> 00:18:20.695
which he himself said in John 14, six, Jesus said,

336
00:18:20.775 --> 00:18:24.845
I am the way, the truth and the life, right?

337
00:18:24.985 --> 00:18:28.205
The truth, not just I have truth, I am full of truth.

338
00:18:28.565 --> 00:18:30.405
I am the truth

339
00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:33.925
in its fullness.

340
00:18:36.465 --> 00:18:37.485
But what does that even mean?

341
00:18:38.725 --> 00:18:40.855
Like we talk about that we amen it. We believe it. Yeah.

342
00:18:40.855 --> 00:18:42.215
Okay, but what does that even mean?

343
00:18:42.315 --> 00:18:45.775
Of course, fullness of truth means his commands

344
00:18:45.795 --> 00:18:48.855
and we need to obey his commands and that's good for us.

345
00:18:49.075 --> 00:18:53.255
Yes, but here's how we hone in on something for us today.

346
00:18:54.495 --> 00:18:58.595
If Jesus is the fullness of truth, then

347
00:18:58.705 --> 00:19:02.675
that means everything in our lives is to be measured by him.

348
00:19:04.705 --> 00:19:09.075
If he's the standard, everything in our lives must be

349
00:19:09.355 --> 00:19:10.755
measured by him.

350
00:19:11.615 --> 00:19:15.715
How he lived, how he spoke, how he responded,

351
00:19:16.015 --> 00:19:20.595
how he loved should be us too,

352
00:19:21.965 --> 00:19:25.875
should be the way we do it measured by his standard.

353
00:19:26.055 --> 00:19:30.875
See, love is not measured by the standard of the world.

354
00:19:32.295 --> 00:19:34.585
Love is how Jesus exemplified it,

355
00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:38.335
how he loved even his enemies.

356
00:19:40.295 --> 00:19:41.715
So, so we can think we're loving,

357
00:19:41.775 --> 00:19:43.235
but if we're not loving like Jesus,

358
00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:45.435
we're not hitting the standard of truth.

359
00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:51.975
Generosity is not measured compared to the standard

360
00:19:51.995 --> 00:19:54.015
of those people around us and how generous they are

361
00:19:54.015 --> 00:19:55.015
or we are or not.

362
00:19:55.065 --> 00:19:56.975
Generosity is how Jesus did it

363
00:19:57.145 --> 00:20:00.095
where he gave his very life for others.

364
00:20:03.575 --> 00:20:08.025
Purity. Purity's not measured based on how, how,

365
00:20:08.025 --> 00:20:09.425
how you're bad or worse

366
00:20:09.425 --> 00:20:11.225
or better than someone else around you.

367
00:20:11.255 --> 00:20:13.025
It's not comparative to anyone else.

368
00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:14.785
Purity is how Jesus did it.

369
00:20:14.925 --> 00:20:19.905
Who by the way lived a perfect life, never sinning once.

370
00:20:20.275 --> 00:20:24.825
Jesus is the standard. He's the fullness of truth.

371
00:20:27.335 --> 00:20:29.545
He's the fullness of grace. He's the fullness of truth.

372
00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:33.865
And so when the glory of God revealed himself

373
00:20:34.325 --> 00:20:38.465
as the only son from the Father, what we now see

374
00:20:38.685 --> 00:20:40.865
and understand is what grace

375
00:20:40.965 --> 00:20:44.885
and truth actually look like in Jesus.

376
00:20:45.105 --> 00:20:48.325
The glory revealed shows us us rather than their ideas

377
00:20:48.395 --> 00:20:49.885
that we kind of understand in our heads.

378
00:20:50.225 --> 00:20:53.445
We see grace and truth in its fullness in Jesus Christ.

379
00:20:56.855 --> 00:21:00.595
And that's why this glory is supreme.

380
00:21:02.835 --> 00:21:05.855
That's why this glory incarnate, this glory revealed.

381
00:21:06.125 --> 00:21:10.375
This glory is supreme over all other

382
00:21:10.485 --> 00:21:11.895
potential competitors.

383
00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:16.815
Which by the way is something even John the

384
00:21:16.815 --> 00:21:17.935
Baptist understood.

385
00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:21.295
You remember who he was, right?

386
00:21:21.395 --> 00:21:25.055
He was the Old Testament prophet Elijah like figure

387
00:21:25.955 --> 00:21:28.535
who was sent by God to prepare the way for the Messiah

388
00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:32.735
to ready the, the pathway that that they would see

389
00:21:32.755 --> 00:21:35.575
and understand who the Messiah was coming to be.

390
00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:38.055
And many and many people thought he was the Messiah.

391
00:21:38.315 --> 00:21:40.935
He told them, no, I'm not. I'm just pointing to the Messiah.

392
00:21:41.315 --> 00:21:43.095
But he was someone,

393
00:21:43.545 --> 00:21:47.855
Jesus himself called the greatest man ever born of a woman.

394
00:21:49.825 --> 00:21:52.205
And so John is a a big time figure.

395
00:21:54.795 --> 00:21:58.455
But did you see what verse 15 records about John the Baptist

396
00:21:58.935 --> 00:22:00.095
claiming about Jesus?

397
00:22:01.415 --> 00:22:04.985
Look at it again. Verse 15, John bore witness about him

398
00:22:05.405 --> 00:22:08.905
and cried out this was he of whom I said, he who comes

399
00:22:08.905 --> 00:22:11.425
after me, ranks before me

400
00:22:11.535 --> 00:22:13.985
because he was before me.

401
00:22:15.405 --> 00:22:16.705
Now, there's a couple things going on here.

402
00:22:16.705 --> 00:22:18.505
I'll explain what he means there.

403
00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:24.575
First John, the Baptist's perspective was that the glory

404
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:27.935
of Jesus was greater than any other

405
00:22:28.225 --> 00:22:29.735
glory anywhere else.

406
00:22:31.015 --> 00:22:32.875
See, there's a lot of talk about rankings right now

407
00:22:33.615 --> 00:22:34.715
who ranks above whom?

408
00:22:34.715 --> 00:22:36.115
Who, who deserves to be here

409
00:22:36.115 --> 00:22:37.555
versus who deserves to be there.

410
00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:39.395
They shouldn't have made it, they shouldn't make it.

411
00:22:39.495 --> 00:22:41.835
All of these. It's a lot of ranking talk.

412
00:22:42.135 --> 00:22:44.875
But John the Baptist knew where he stood.

413
00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:53.985
Jesus, John later said this about Jesus, I'm unworthy

414
00:22:54.085 --> 00:22:55.945
to even untie his sandal.

415
00:22:58.455 --> 00:22:59.955
The illustration of being on your face

416
00:22:59.955 --> 00:23:02.315
before someone touching the dirtiest part of their body.

417
00:23:02.505 --> 00:23:03.715
He's like, I can't even do that.

418
00:23:03.775 --> 00:23:06.635
I'm not even worthy to get close to him in that way.

419
00:23:06.815 --> 00:23:08.715
He also understood in chapter

420
00:23:08.765 --> 00:23:10.315
three, he's talking about Jesus.

421
00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:14.955
He says, man, I must decrease, but Jesus must increase.

422
00:23:17.925 --> 00:23:22.265
And then he said this. He said, he who comes from above is

423
00:23:22.435 --> 00:23:26.965
above all John this,

424
00:23:27.235 --> 00:23:31.525
this hu, this humble man gazing upon the glory

425
00:23:31.525 --> 00:23:32.725
of God in Jesus Christ.

426
00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:35.405
He recognized where he stood

427
00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:40.505
because he recognized the glory of God found in Jesus.

428
00:23:41.645 --> 00:23:42.865
And so he knew the ranking,

429
00:23:43.365 --> 00:23:44.865
but he also understood something else.

430
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.245
Second, John understood that Jesus was God in the flesh.

431
00:23:51.235 --> 00:23:56.055
He knew it. He knew it from before he even met Jesus.

432
00:23:56.415 --> 00:23:57.935
'cause remember what verse 15 said?

433
00:23:58.195 --> 00:24:01.695
He who comes after me, ranks before me

434
00:24:02.005 --> 00:24:04.255
because he was before me.

435
00:24:05.495 --> 00:24:09.065
He's talking about Jesus's preexistence as God,

436
00:24:09.135 --> 00:24:11.545
that Jesus wasn't born like he was born.

437
00:24:11.675 --> 00:24:15.545
Jesus was born as a man taking on flesh, God

438
00:24:16.425 --> 00:24:17.425
becoming a man.

439
00:24:19.235 --> 00:24:21.445
Because in the timeline, if you know your story

440
00:24:21.445 --> 00:24:24.845
around Christmas, John the Baptist was actually born

441
00:24:24.855 --> 00:24:28.615
first with Elizabeth.

442
00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:32.055
He was born a couple months ahead of when Jesus was born.

443
00:24:32.395 --> 00:24:36.455
But here, John clearly says, Jesus existed before I did.

444
00:24:38.335 --> 00:24:40.335
I was created. Jesus was not created.

445
00:24:42.225 --> 00:24:43.685
God the Son was not created.

446
00:24:43.685 --> 00:24:45.085
Which points us back to verse one.

447
00:24:45.325 --> 00:24:47.765
Remember this in the beginning was the word.

448
00:24:48.735 --> 00:24:51.515
He was already there. The word was with God

449
00:24:51.515 --> 00:24:53.035
and the word was God.

450
00:24:53.185 --> 00:24:56.155
John knew Jesus was God the Son.

451
00:24:59.345 --> 00:25:01.725
So glory incarnate,

452
00:25:02.055 --> 00:25:06.045
glory revealed it certainly was supreme over John

453
00:25:07.835 --> 00:25:12.425
Glory, over John Supreme, over John again, as great

454
00:25:12.425 --> 00:25:16.705
as John the Baptist was this giant of a man

455
00:25:16.805 --> 00:25:18.825
who Jesus looked at and said was great.

456
00:25:19.005 --> 00:25:22.225
As faithful as John was, there was zero comparison

457
00:25:22.225 --> 00:25:23.945
between John and Jesus.

458
00:25:25.745 --> 00:25:28.525
The glory of God and Jesus was supreme over

459
00:25:29.245 --> 00:25:31.165
anything John brought to the table.

460
00:25:31.545 --> 00:25:34.085
But we also see something else here in verse 17.

461
00:25:34.555 --> 00:25:37.845
This glory was superior also over Moses.

462
00:25:40.585 --> 00:25:41.675
Over Moses two.

463
00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:45.495
Look at verses 16

464
00:25:45.595 --> 00:25:50.485
and 17 again, for from his fullness,

465
00:25:50.905 --> 00:25:52.805
we have all received grace upon grace

466
00:25:53.345 --> 00:25:55.285
for the law was given through Moses.

467
00:25:56.015 --> 00:25:59.405
Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

468
00:26:02.525 --> 00:26:03.735
John, notice what he does.

469
00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:09.245
He compares the incarnation of Jesus with the giving

470
00:26:09.345 --> 00:26:14.055
of the law in the Old Testament that both in a way

471
00:26:14.055 --> 00:26:17.815
where God revealing himself to his people.

472
00:26:17.995 --> 00:26:19.895
Now we often on our side of this

473
00:26:20.425 --> 00:26:23.935
we'll pit those two things against each other like, ah,

474
00:26:23.935 --> 00:26:24.935
we're not law people anymore.

475
00:26:24.935 --> 00:26:28.895
We're Jesus people and we'll think they're in opposition.

476
00:26:29.435 --> 00:26:31.015
We forget when we do that.

477
00:26:31.075 --> 00:26:33.615
We forget that God's giving

478
00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:38.535
of the law was actually a measure of his grace too, right?

479
00:26:38.675 --> 00:26:39.695
You ever thought about it that way?

480
00:26:42.065 --> 00:26:45.685
Because remember when God freed his people from slavery in

481
00:26:45.735 --> 00:26:50.605
Egypt, he graciously gave them a covenant by which they were

482
00:26:50.605 --> 00:26:53.725
to live so they would do well in the promised land

483
00:26:55.315 --> 00:26:58.175
and so that they would reflect his goodness

484
00:26:58.315 --> 00:26:59.815
to a watching world around them.

485
00:27:00.595 --> 00:27:04.575
The law was good to lead them towards those things.

486
00:27:07.905 --> 00:27:09.925
It reflected the character of God to them.

487
00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:12.925
They wouldn't have known otherwise how good God was.

488
00:27:13.425 --> 00:27:15.725
But he told them, he showed them.

489
00:27:15.865 --> 00:27:19.185
He gave them his words so that they could know him.

490
00:27:19.845 --> 00:27:21.465
It was good. The law was good,

491
00:27:25.585 --> 00:27:28.565
but it was still law and commandments, right?

492
00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:34.865
That's why Jesus coming full of truth and grace.

493
00:27:36.575 --> 00:27:40.805
Grace upon grace He came in that that's why

494
00:27:40.805 --> 00:27:41.805
that's such good news.

495
00:27:43.065 --> 00:27:48.005
If we only had law, it's good, but it's not good news.

496
00:27:51.685 --> 00:27:54.515
Jesus is truth, absolutely,

497
00:27:54.775 --> 00:27:57.635
but he, he does that in a gracious way.

498
00:27:59.265 --> 00:28:02.685
He is truth. He does it in an undeservedly kind way

499
00:28:04.545 --> 00:28:06.195
because when Jesus is the truth,

500
00:28:06.415 --> 00:28:07.875
you go read the New Testament.

501
00:28:08.445 --> 00:28:11.195
There are some times that Jesus is really firm

502
00:28:12.515 --> 00:28:14.895
in teaching the truth to people who need it to hear it.

503
00:28:16.335 --> 00:28:18.625
Matthew five, in the Sermon on the Mount

504
00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:20.065
where Jesus is talking about,

505
00:28:20.245 --> 00:28:23.145
you guys hear it this way, that this is sin.

506
00:28:23.265 --> 00:28:24.625
I actually take it a whole lot farther

507
00:28:24.725 --> 00:28:26.025
and I go to your heart and say,

508
00:28:26.025 --> 00:28:28.545
this is actually the sin root of that one sin.

509
00:28:30.925 --> 00:28:35.685
So he's firm, he he's really firm in

510
00:28:35.865 --> 00:28:38.485
the truth as he taught people how to live.

511
00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:40.325
He's saying, here's the standard, it's me.

512
00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:42.125
It's not what everybody else says it's me.

513
00:28:43.365 --> 00:28:46.065
But in that he in grace

514
00:28:46.845 --> 00:28:50.505
showed God's compassion and love toward broken

515
00:28:50.565 --> 00:28:51.785
and sinful people like you

516
00:28:51.785 --> 00:28:56.275
and me all over the place, those

517
00:28:56.335 --> 00:28:59.355
who needed God's forgiveness, he said, here's grace,

518
00:28:59.695 --> 00:29:01.395
here's love, here's forgiveness.

519
00:29:05.445 --> 00:29:07.825
But again, don't pit it against the law

520
00:29:07.825 --> 00:29:11.605
because remember in the law, God made a way for you

521
00:29:11.605 --> 00:29:15.045
to be forgiven through sacrificial systems that he set up.

522
00:29:16.225 --> 00:29:17.335
There was still grace,

523
00:29:18.735 --> 00:29:20.525
there was law, but there was still grace.

524
00:29:20.915 --> 00:29:24.575
It's just that now in its fullness,

525
00:29:25.395 --> 00:29:28.525
you see it in Jesus, you see grace,

526
00:29:28.705 --> 00:29:31.085
you see truth exemplified shown

527
00:29:31.185 --> 00:29:34.845
and given grace upon grace through Jesus

528
00:29:35.195 --> 00:29:37.525
because what the law could never do,

529
00:29:38.905 --> 00:29:40.815
Jesus came to do that.

530
00:29:41.775 --> 00:29:44.795
Listen to this in Romans chapter eight it says,

531
00:29:44.855 --> 00:29:48.115
for God has done what the law weakened

532
00:29:48.215 --> 00:29:49.875
by the flesh could not do

533
00:29:50.775 --> 00:29:53.435
by sending his own son in the likeness

534
00:29:53.535 --> 00:29:55.795
of sinful flesh for sin.

535
00:29:56.055 --> 00:29:59.115
He condemned sin in the flesh in order

536
00:29:59.115 --> 00:30:00.515
that the righteous requirement

537
00:30:00.515 --> 00:30:03.755
of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according

538
00:30:03.755 --> 00:30:05.795
to the flesh but according to the spirit.

539
00:30:07.495 --> 00:30:11.075
That's why this glory revealed in God, the Son,

540
00:30:11.375 --> 00:30:13.955
the flesh He took on that glory.

541
00:30:14.135 --> 00:30:16.995
That's why that is supreme over every other glory

542
00:30:16.995 --> 00:30:20.275
because that's the only way we could actually be saved.

543
00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:26.205
The law is good. The law has grace, but it cannot save us.

544
00:30:26.475 --> 00:30:30.645
It's only through the God man, Jesus satisfying the demands

545
00:30:30.705 --> 00:30:35.045
of that law and then dying on the cross for us

546
00:30:35.385 --> 00:30:37.645
and the penalty of that sin in our lives.

547
00:30:39.425 --> 00:30:42.755
It's the only way that's grace because we don't deserve it.

548
00:30:46.055 --> 00:30:50.515
His glory, supreme seen in grace and truth

549
00:30:53.765 --> 00:30:57.045
and notice this, everything I've said so far,

550
00:30:58.735 --> 00:31:01.345
God did all of that so

551
00:31:01.345 --> 00:31:03.745
that his glory could be known.

552
00:31:07.515 --> 00:31:12.175
He did everything chapter one says, so that

553
00:31:13.515 --> 00:31:16.055
his glory could be known,

554
00:31:18.665 --> 00:31:22.955
not just hinted at not just suspected,

555
00:31:23.495 --> 00:31:28.035
but actually known, not just known about.

556
00:31:28.295 --> 00:31:29.755
We know about God's glory,

557
00:31:30.915 --> 00:31:34.995
actually known His glory can be known because listen, if you

558
00:31:34.995 --> 00:31:38.555
and I in our sin would see God in all

559
00:31:38.555 --> 00:31:40.195
of his fullness, we would die.

560
00:31:42.575 --> 00:31:45.595
No one can see God and live because we're sinful. He's not.

561
00:31:45.665 --> 00:31:48.395
He's holy, he's glorious. We would die.

562
00:31:49.645 --> 00:31:53.215
Even Moses on Sinai, the mountain

563
00:31:53.245 --> 00:31:56.335
that God invited him up to to say, come meet with me.

564
00:31:56.725 --> 00:31:59.615
Even on the mountain, Moses says, God,

565
00:31:59.775 --> 00:32:00.775
I wanna see your glory.

566
00:32:00.955 --> 00:32:02.215
And God's like, Hey, hold up.

567
00:32:02.395 --> 00:32:04.335
Uh, I'm gonna put you in this cave

568
00:32:04.435 --> 00:32:06.815
and I'm just gonna let you see the very last

569
00:32:06.965 --> 00:32:08.455
glimmer of my robe.

570
00:32:11.815 --> 00:32:13.375
'cause he knew Moses couldn't handle it.

571
00:32:13.995 --> 00:32:17.065
Moses could not see God and live

572
00:32:17.065 --> 00:32:20.105
because of Moses being human, sinful

573
00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:21.665
and God being glorious and holy.

574
00:32:26.415 --> 00:32:30.155
Yet in that same scene where Moses is involved

575
00:32:30.185 --> 00:32:33.875
with God's glory, God reveals his character to Moses

576
00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:39.215
that in his fullness, he's merciful,

577
00:32:39.555 --> 00:32:42.285
he's gracious, he is slow to anger, abounding

578
00:32:42.285 --> 00:32:44.405
and steadfast love and faithfulness.

579
00:32:44.505 --> 00:32:46.645
And so what we get a picture of here is

580
00:32:46.645 --> 00:32:49.165
what God was doing is saying, here's a glimpse of my glory.

581
00:32:49.265 --> 00:32:50.845
Here's a little sliver of my glory.

582
00:32:50.955 --> 00:32:53.405
Yeah, you see this part of my robe, but here's who I am.

583
00:32:53.465 --> 00:32:56.565
Here's who I am. My words are telling you who I am.

584
00:32:56.745 --> 00:32:59.925
My glory is this is, this is this,

585
00:33:00.105 --> 00:33:03.245
but here's where this matters in John one 18, what

586
00:33:03.245 --> 00:33:05.765
that shows us is that in Jesus Christ,

587
00:33:06.145 --> 00:33:10.525
in the word becoming flesh, we get a more full revelation

588
00:33:10.745 --> 00:33:12.445
of God's glory as God.

589
00:33:12.465 --> 00:33:16.235
The Son makes him known like we'll hear it,

590
00:33:16.925 --> 00:33:19.595
we'll hear it, we'll read it, we'll understand it.

591
00:33:20.215 --> 00:33:23.075
We get a glimpse of God through his word.

592
00:33:23.135 --> 00:33:27.315
But what we actually see in Jesus since he actually is God,

593
00:33:27.615 --> 00:33:31.715
is that in him, he reveals God to us in ways

594
00:33:31.715 --> 00:33:33.635
that no other revelation can reveal.

595
00:33:35.075 --> 00:33:39.745
Just think about this. God's word in the Old

596
00:33:39.945 --> 00:33:42.065
Testament was mediated through prophets

597
00:33:44.165 --> 00:33:45.775
like they spoke on behalf of God.

598
00:33:45.955 --> 00:33:48.255
Nobody got God's word directly.

599
00:33:48.255 --> 00:33:51.975
It was God's prophets speaking his word to people.

600
00:33:52.185 --> 00:33:56.295
God's glory, even in that tabernacle was hidden

601
00:33:56.355 --> 00:33:57.575
behind a curtain.

602
00:33:59.675 --> 00:34:01.255
It was mediated through priests.

603
00:34:01.255 --> 00:34:03.175
They had to go in there in a special way and

604
00:34:03.235 --> 00:34:07.375
and kind of appease and go and sacrifice and come back out

605
00:34:07.395 --> 00:34:09.175
and this carry back and forth.

606
00:34:09.175 --> 00:34:12.295
They were priests mediating between the glory of God.

607
00:34:12.315 --> 00:34:15.415
Nobody could go in besides the one man once a year, right?

608
00:34:16.315 --> 00:34:21.025
That's the point. Those revelation

609
00:34:21.255 --> 00:34:22.945
ways were limited.

610
00:34:26.295 --> 00:34:28.595
Yet Jesus came so

611
00:34:28.595 --> 00:34:32.715
that his people could experience the glory of God in full.

612
00:34:37.365 --> 00:34:40.945
He came to say, I am God, I am the glory of God

613
00:34:41.545 --> 00:34:42.865
revealed to you.

614
00:34:44.345 --> 00:34:47.125
So we see God's glory in Jesus.

615
00:34:47.345 --> 00:34:50.565
And then by the way, for us today, he plants his spirit

616
00:34:50.785 --> 00:34:54.405
inside of us to dwell within us, not just to dwell with us

617
00:34:56.375 --> 00:35:01.365
so that we have the glory of God within us now, all

618
00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:05.045
because God the son

619
00:35:05.905 --> 00:35:10.555
became flesh and dwelt among us so

620
00:35:10.555 --> 00:35:11.675
that we could know him.

621
00:35:14.185 --> 00:35:15.995
Otherwise, God stays over here.

622
00:35:16.215 --> 00:35:17.675
We stay here, we're in trouble.

623
00:35:17.775 --> 00:35:19.995
We might know about God, but we wouldn't know him

624
00:35:20.015 --> 00:35:24.875
unless he makes the way for us to experience His glory

625
00:35:27.345 --> 00:35:29.285
and to be transformed

626
00:35:30.465 --> 00:35:33.165
as we gaze upon His glory.

627
00:35:33.165 --> 00:35:35.125
Listen to what second Corinthians three says.

628
00:35:35.185 --> 00:35:38.765
As Paul reflects on this idea, he says, we all

629
00:35:39.035 --> 00:35:41.925
with unveiled face, meaning that veil

630
00:35:41.995 --> 00:35:44.725
that separated us from God has been taken away.

631
00:35:44.785 --> 00:35:47.965
Now we have access back and forth with the glory of God.

632
00:35:47.985 --> 00:35:52.005
He says, we all with unveiled face, behold looking at,

633
00:35:52.005 --> 00:35:56.165
staring at the glory of the Lord are being transformed

634
00:35:56.715 --> 00:36:00.445
into the same image from one degree of glory to another.

635
00:36:02.555 --> 00:36:07.195
Right? That's the unmediated glory of God.

636
00:36:07.295 --> 00:36:11.475
Now we gaze and stare and look at it and reflect on it,

637
00:36:11.475 --> 00:36:15.555
and he changes us into that kind

638
00:36:15.775 --> 00:36:16.915
of image again

639
00:36:20.975 --> 00:36:23.555
and and still remember church, listen at Christmas,

640
00:36:25.015 --> 00:36:28.615
remember, God could have left us in our sin.

641
00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:32.525
He could have abandoned us

642
00:36:32.995 --> 00:36:35.245
because we turned our backs on him.

643
00:36:35.505 --> 00:36:36.845
We said, we don't want anything to do with you.

644
00:36:37.105 --> 00:36:40.485
We don't care. We could have been left in

645
00:36:40.485 --> 00:36:43.045
that eternal deadness and darkness,

646
00:36:46.445 --> 00:36:50.885
but he didn't because of his grace.

647
00:36:52.135 --> 00:36:57.005
What did he do? He took on flesh to give us life,

648
00:36:58.185 --> 00:37:01.885
to shine light into the darkness of our sin,

649
00:37:04.245 --> 00:37:08.155
to be and flesh out grace

650
00:37:08.615 --> 00:37:12.035
and truth, to save us, to make us more like Him.

651
00:37:12.415 --> 00:37:13.995
That's why he came.

652
00:37:14.185 --> 00:37:16.755
Just like Jesus prayed, John 17, he said,

653
00:37:16.825 --> 00:37:19.795
this is eternal life that they know you,

654
00:37:20.735 --> 00:37:23.875
the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you sent.

655
00:37:24.105 --> 00:37:28.425
This is why he came so that we would be able,

656
00:37:28.775 --> 00:37:30.905
sinners like you and me would be able

657
00:37:30.965 --> 00:37:34.305
to know him in a way we never could on our own,

658
00:37:38.565 --> 00:37:39.345
and so do you.

659
00:37:42.605 --> 00:37:46.985
Do you know him? If you don't

660
00:37:49.485 --> 00:37:51.495
turn from your sin and turn to him

661
00:37:51.515 --> 00:37:55.395
and say, I believe Jesus I I believe in you,

662
00:37:58.605 --> 00:38:02.815
and if you do believe, rejoice in him.

663
00:38:04.435 --> 00:38:06.955
Rejoice in this glory incarnate.

664
00:38:07.905 --> 00:38:12.435
This glory revealed this glory supreme over all things,

665
00:38:12.735 --> 00:38:16.915
and may we live in the hope of that glory known

666
00:38:17.925 --> 00:38:20.715
today, this week in

667
00:38:20.995 --> 00:38:23.675
Christmas and every day.

668
00:38:25.055 --> 00:38:28.115
That's the hope we have in the glory of God

669
00:38:28.985 --> 00:38:29.995
seen in Jesus Christ.

670
00:38:31.125 --> 00:38:33.235
Would you pray with me towards that end today

671
00:38:38.665 --> 00:38:43.045
As we look at him, as we gaze upon his glory

672
00:38:43.605 --> 00:38:46.565
revealed in His word,

673
00:38:48.705 --> 00:38:50.405
in the word Jesus,

674
00:38:53.595 --> 00:38:55.765
just reflect on that for a moment to say

675
00:38:56.945 --> 00:39:01.485
and ask yourself, what does that belief mean to me?

676
00:39:01.755 --> 00:39:05.965
What does that mean? Belief mean? Do you believe?

677
00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:13.845
Have you seen God like this?

678
00:39:18.985 --> 00:39:21.405
Listen, if he's been just a buddy on a shelf

679
00:39:21.405 --> 00:39:24.205
that you pull down whenever you need him, but

680
00:39:24.205 --> 00:39:25.885
otherwise he has nothing to do with your life, then

681
00:39:25.885 --> 00:39:28.765
that is wrong.

682
00:39:32.305 --> 00:39:35.485
The glory of God revealed in Jesus means he is.

683
00:39:35.485 --> 00:39:40.365
Everything should be everything to us.

684
00:39:43.935 --> 00:39:45.725
Maybe that means this Christmas looks a little different

685
00:39:45.725 --> 00:39:48.605
to worship him, not just be sentimental about the holiday,

686
00:39:48.785 --> 00:39:52.085
but to worship Him God with us

687
00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:57.245
so that we would know him and glorify.

688
00:39:59.505 --> 00:40:01.725
If you have some questions about that, come find one of us

689
00:40:01.725 --> 00:40:04.125
after the service is done, just to be honest

690
00:40:04.145 --> 00:40:06.925
and ask questions and love to help you with that.

691
00:40:12.035 --> 00:40:13.405
This is our God.

692
00:40:26.915 --> 00:40:28.165
Lord, we give you the glory.

693
00:40:32.905 --> 00:40:34.805
You must increase, we must decrease.

694
00:40:39.025 --> 00:40:41.845
The one who is from above is above all

695
00:40:47.185 --> 00:40:48.205
you are before us.

696
00:40:48.905 --> 00:40:50.525
You are higher than us

697
00:40:51.785 --> 00:40:55.165
and so may we give you the glory that you are worthy of.

698
00:41:01.295 --> 00:41:04.885
Thank you God. We don't deserve grace upon grace,

699
00:41:06.305 --> 00:41:09.685
and yet you made the way you came to us to make us

700
00:41:11.835 --> 00:41:15.765
more like you as we believe so God, give us

701
00:41:15.765 --> 00:41:17.365
that faith we need today.

702
00:41:17.745 --> 00:41:19.525
In Jesus' name, amen.
