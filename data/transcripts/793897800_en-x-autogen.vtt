1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.400
For the grace of God offers salvation to

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.700
all people teaching us to live Godly

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.200
life.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.500
Jesus gave himself for us to redeem us and to

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
purify for himself.

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.500
A people that are his very own.

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.400
Well, good morning. Again Church. It is a joy to be a part of those every

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.700
time we do that and so it is something

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.000
that we hope encourages you and challenges you as well

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.400
just as as I try to do with every wedding that

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.400
I am a part of even just attending to say that

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.200
it's a reminder to me of my

13
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.700
commitment to my wife 17 and a half years ago. So

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.400
maybe as a parent that's just a reminder for you

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.000
as well.

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200
But I'm excited to see so many new faces with us over the last few weeks.

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
And if that's you we hope that you feel at some

18
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.100
point when you're ready comfortable enough to be able to be known here. We want

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.600
to make that as simple as possible as more likely as

20
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.100
possible because there's something about connection something about

21
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.200
belonging to a people and being known by

22
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.100
that we want you to to get there now. It's

23
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.800
a step of faith. I realized for you who are new but again,

24
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.500
let us help you there's a QR code there come introduce

25
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
yourself to us. Either way. We want to help you.

26
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.800
But what we're doing is we're continuing our series through the book of Titus in

27
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.100
God's word. And so go ahead and turn there with me

28
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.000
late in the New Testament towards the end the book of

29
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.600
Titus.

30
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
This is the Apostle Paul's letter to his man

31
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.300
on Crete whose name was Titus which is

32
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
why it's called Titus very creatively as you're turning

33
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300
there though many years ago. I went to

34
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.300
a Men's Conference because I

35
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.100
thought it would be helpful and it had it had

36
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.300
the lineup of the most popular speakers at the time.

37
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.800
But looking back I can identify some

38
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.200
problems.

39
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.300
That I now see some serious

40
00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.900
errors.

41
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.300
In that multiple men on that platform now have disqualified

42
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.100
themselves from Ministry because they don't

43
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.700
match the character qualities of Elders that we saw from

44
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.100
Titus 1 verses 5 through 9 a couple weeks ago.

45
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400
And they have fallen off in various ways,

46
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.100
but also at that conference.

47
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.100
There was an inordinate focus on on Manliness.

48
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.000
that now feels way more secular and

49
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.200
worldly then Godly

50
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.900
in Christ like

51
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.600
Now hear me. I'm thankful for those who are pushing and striving

52
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.200
to strengthen the resolve of men to stand up

53
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.500
and and stand in the Gap and protect and defend

54
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.400
and and bring Justice. Yes.

55
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.400
but when manhood devolves into a tough

56
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.300
guy contest

57
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.100
or that emotions are weak and you

58
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.800
can never cry.

59
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.300
Or some caricature that if you don't like

60
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.500
guns and trucks that you're not a real man.

61
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.400
Like that's where we've missed it.

62
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.800
And we've gotten off track somewhere.

63
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.300
And so what we're going to see in Titus 2 today is a

64
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.800
picture of true manhood.

65
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.900
As we look back at this scene in Crete.

66
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.900
We'll see the truth that Godly manhood is different than worldly. Manhood.

67
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.300
Godly Godly manhood is very different.

68
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.900
Than worldly manhood.

69
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.800
See in contrast thinking about that 2,000 years ago increase in

70
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.900
contrast to the way of that world that was being lived

71
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.100
in.

72
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.200
In contrast to those remember false teachers who were

73
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.000
who were Liars?

74
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.400
They were evil beasts.

75
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.700
They were lazy gluttons.

76
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.100
in contrast to all that what does God say a real

77
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.700
man looks like

78
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.900
What does God say a real man acts like?

79
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.900
Titus 2 verses 1 through 10 will show us

80
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.200
Now when I read this passage in a moment, you need to know that I'm planning to come

81
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.500
back through this same passage next week with a

82
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.600
focus on discipling women.

83
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.600
You'll see it kind of bounces back and forth. So we're going to take the same passage next

84
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.100
week about women. So let me

85
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.800
talk to you wives today.

86
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.300
Don't be elbow and your husband today through the

87
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.200
sermon. Did you hear what he said? You know, like that's not gonna

88
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.300
be good because it's coming back for you next week, right? So so it's

89
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.400
gonna be back and forth. God is an equal opportunity rebuker. So

90
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.400
we're both gonna have to learn and grow in these things. So

91
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.400
don't just just let the Lord work. Okay, right.

92
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.500
Plus you can't change anyone by nitpicking and nagging anyway,

93
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.600
and so let's let the Lord work, right?

94
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.400
Let's be humble enough to set our lives before this

95
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.600
both both our lives and our significant others

96
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.200
lives and other people in our lives. They're like, let's let's

97
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.400
be humble enough to say God. This is yours and you need to change this

98
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.200
you need to work on this including me.

99
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.300
Allowing that to happen humbling ourselves before his

100
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.700
word.

101
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.900
So don't be elbow and but also women don't check out on this because because hear

102
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.900
me if you're not married.

103
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.600
And you want to be married?

104
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.700
What I hope you hear today are the character qualities of

105
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.800
a man. You should look for.

106
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.100
This is what you should be striving for praying for.

107
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.000
Maybe you're not married and you don't want to be married. That's fine. Look

108
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.200
for ways to encourage the men in

109
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.900
your life towards these kinds of things.

110
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.200
and then wives

111
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.900
look for how you can pray for your husband.

112
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.400
How you can lift him up in these ways as you'll see in

113
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.600
God's word.

114
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.400
Let's look now at Titus 2 verses 1 through

115
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.600
10.

116
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.500
But as for you, that's remember Paul talking

117
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.200
to Titus in contrast to what he just said

118
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.200
about the false teachers. He says but as for you Titus

119
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.100
teach what Accords with sound Doctrine?

120
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.300
Older men are to be sober-minded dignified self-controlled.

121
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.900
Sound in faith in love and instead fastness.

122
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.800
Older women likewise are to be reverent in Behavior

123
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.200
not Slanders or slaves to much

124
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.500
wine. They are to teach what is good? And so train

125
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.300
the young women to love their husbands and children to be self-controlled pure

126
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.900
working at home kind submissive to

127
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.100
their own husbands that the word of God may not be

128
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.800
reviled.

129
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.800
Likewise urge the younger men to be self-controlled.

130
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.000
Show yourself in all respects to be

131
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.200
a model of good works.

132
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.400
And in your teaching show Integrity dignity and sound speech

133
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.500
that cannot be condemned.

134
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.400
So that an opponent may be put to shame having nothing

135
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.600
evil to say about us.

136
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.400
Bond servants are to be submissive to their own masters and everything.

137
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.400
They are to be well pleasing not argumentative not pilfering

138
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.700
or stealing not show but

139
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.700
showing all good faith.

140
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.400
So that in everything they may Adorn the

141
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.100
doctrine of God our savior.

142
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.400
God we need you.

143
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.800
This is your word speaks directly to

144
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.300
that scene in creat, but we know it speaks to us today.

145
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.200
So give us ways to apply give us

146
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.400
ways to see give us ways to understand make us good soil

147
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.300
in our hearts to understand what you want for us

148
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.000
as men.

149
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.400
To support those around us those men in our lives.

150
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.900
That you might show the world something different.

151
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.000
Thank you, Lord.

152
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.000
Holy Spirit work in us today in Jesus Authority

153
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.500
we pray amen.

154
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.100
So if you remember from the end of chapter one last week.

155
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.400
The false teachers were upsetting whole families.

156
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.700
That's the way it says it.

157
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.200
They were teaching false things and it was it was

158
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.200
it was affecting families. And so they it was

159
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.000
affecting the way families were supposed to behave the way they were

160
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.700
supposed to interact the household codes. You might say and so here in

161
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.500
Titus 2, there's a corrective to that.

162
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.300
Titus needs to hear what Paul says

163
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.300
that the false teachers teaching this Paul says here's what

164
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.400
a Godly household looks like.

165
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.400
Here's what kind of Lifestyle matches healthy Doctrine.

166
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.400
The gospel, here's what it looks like because remember this is this is

167
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.400
Titus. We're talking about his very own the church is

168
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.000
but we are so so we submit Our Lives including

169
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.700
our families to what God wants.

170
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.600
So what does healthy manhood look

171
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.400
like then?

172
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.500
Let's examine what it looks like for the cretan Believers here,

173
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.600
but then how we can apply it to our lives today. What

174
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.600
is healthy? Manhood sound remember

175
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.800
that word sound means healthy. So we're talking Health here.

176
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.800
Well verse 2 and verse 6 are the two verses specifically given

177
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.300
regarding men in the church. The first ones to the

178
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.300
older men. The second one wants to the younger men.

179
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.700
Now here's just a side note in verse 2. The Greek

180
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.400
is doesn't mean old. Like you're not

181
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.500
old guys. It's actually aged like a

182
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.300
fine cheese. So think of that like if I

183
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.400
get all just like cheese, right? So anyway, but that's

184
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.100
what older men are to be and then what younger men

185
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.900
and the list for older men is much longer. Yes.

186
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.300
But remember it's assumed here that a

187
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.400
younger man will eventually be an older man.

188
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.200
So don't you think we should be pursuing this list

189
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.300
of the older men all men should be

190
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.300
pursuing what you see in the list for older men here.

191
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.600
That's what this list is look at verse 2 again. Let's read it.

192
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:13.000
Older men are to be sober-minded dignified self-controlled sound

193
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.800
and faith in love and instead fastness.

194
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.600
It's quite the list right? There's a lot of similar words in there a lot

195
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.600
of similar meanings. And so what I did is I summarized

196
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.900
them into three categories of healthy manhood.

197
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.300
Took all that right there and tried to summarize it down

198
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.800
into three simple words.

199
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.900
First that a healthy man is loving.

200
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.900
Healthy man is loving.

201
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.500
He says at the end an older man ought to be sound or healthy.

202
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.300
in love

203
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.500
That's the Greek word agape.

204
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.100
Very familiar word used in all of the

205
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.300
New Testament for love, especially for the

206
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.400
love. That is sacrificial that Jesus has for

207
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.000
his people.

208
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.000
Ephesians 5 verse 2 commands us to walk

209
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.200
in agape.

210
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.200
as Christ Agape us

211
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.600
and gave himself up for us a fragrant

212
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.700
offering and sacrifice to God.

213
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.700
So Christ his love was

214
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.200
a sacrifice. And so what you see here is

215
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.500
a true picture of what Love Actually is. We've

216
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.300
said it before here that love is willing self-sacrifice for

217
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.300
the good of someone else even when they don't deserve it

218
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.900
and even when they can never pay you back.

219
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.700
It's it's love that is giving so a

220
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.100
Godly Man is someone who is healthy in the

221
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.700
way. He loves others.

222
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.800
Sacrifices for others a sacrificial lifestyle

223
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.500
generously giving to those in your

224
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:50.700
life.

225
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.500
Just think of the parable of the Good Samaritan that Jesus told in Luke chapter 10.

226
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.700
In that story there were religious people who passed by

227
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.800
this man who'd been beaten up on the side of the road.

228
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.700
Cross to the other side, but the Good Samaritan had

229
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.100
compassion for him.

230
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.600
And not only felt something but he he picked

231
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.400
the man up. He bandaged his wounds. He took care

232
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.100
of him at the hotel. He paid for that man to stay

233
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.700
there. As long as he needed to stay there. That was Jesus saying this

234
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.800
is what love looks like.

235
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.400
Not just that he felt compassion, but he actually did

236
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.300
something about it. That's how you love your neighbor. Jesus

237
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:33.700
says.

238
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.600
That's the picture Jesus gave and so it's not just a feeling.

239
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.300
And it's not just dad's. Listen, it's not just saying I love

240
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:44.600
my kids.

241
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.600
It's actually sacrificing and

242
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.200
dying to yourself.

243
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.300
As a living sacrifice for others.

244
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.600
you remember the the cretans were described as

245
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.600
Liars

246
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.400
evil

247
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.500
that word Beast is like animal impulses. They're

248
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.500
led by their flesh. They're led by just whatever drives them

249
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.300
at that moment, right? They're lazy gluttons.

250
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.100
So to be think about this to be a sacrificially loving

251
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.300
man.

252
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.200
in that culture

253
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.900
would have been in direct contrast to

254
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.600
the way of the world.

255
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.100
But hear me it's in direct contrast to the way

256
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.600
of our world today too, isn't it?

257
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.800
Because most everything in our lives as

258
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.400
men says go get yours.

259
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.700
Take what you want.

260
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800
live for yourself

261
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.200
Go do your thing, right? All this culture breeds

262
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.100
selfishness?

263
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.800
When God's call to men in Ephesians 5 is

264
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.500
to give is to sacrifice like

265
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.400
he did for us.

266
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.400
Later Ephesians 5 when he's talking about marriage, he says

267
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.200
husbands Agape your wives.

268
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.200
As Christ Agape the church and gave

269
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:17.800
himself for her.

270
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.800
How did Christ love the church he gave himself?

271
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.800
He died for the church.

272
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.100
Husbands do that for your wife.

273
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.600
So Godly Man a healthy man is loving.

274
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.600
in the way God describes loving

275
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.200
but Titus 2 also says that a healthy

276
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.300
man is faithful.

277
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:46.900
He's faithful.

278
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.100
Again here at the end of that verse it says that he is

279
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.900
sound or healthy in faith.

280
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.400
and instead fastness

281
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.800
that first there's a deep faith in this man.

282
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.000
a trust in the Lord

283
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.300
a trust that keeps one Rock Solid

284
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.600
in fact steadfastness is one of the greatest qualities

285
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.900
that I admire in older men.

286
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.300
There was a man in the church that we served out in

287
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.400
Weatherford Oklahoma my first church out of Seminary.

288
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.200
a man named Toby Hawkins

289
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.200
Who was the steadiest man that I've ever met?

290
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.100
You know those people right that just they're the same

291
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.600
every day, you know what you're gonna get from them and they are constant everything

292
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.400
bad happens. Everything good happens. They are

293
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:37.800
steady.

294
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.000
The other word that the end of verse 2 is similar, it's steadfastness

295
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.800
right that there's faith and steadfastness it

296
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.200
that word means the ability to stand up

297
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.000
under pressure.

298
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.500
to hold out under difficulty

299
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.300
like when you're getting pressed you're getting pushed you're able

300
00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.900
to stand nothing changes.

301
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.600
It's easy to stand when there's no wind on you. But when there's a 70 mile-hour

302
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.400
Gail, it's a little harder, right but steadfast means I'm standing

303
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.000
still no matter what's coming. That's steadfast.

304
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.600
Patience endurance fortitude perseverance. Those

305
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.800
are similar words to steadfastness.

306
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.700
Jonathan Edwards, some of you might know that name he modeled

307
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.000
this quality back in 1750.

308
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.500
Jonathan Edwards, one of the greatest theologians in American history.

309
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.000
He was fired after serving

310
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.300
over 20 years at the church in Northampton,

311
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.800
Massachusetts.

312
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.100
And there was a man in the in the precedings that happened is like

313
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.700
a week-long deal a man named David Hall he participated

314
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.100
in it and here's how he recorded the way Edwards responded.

315
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.300
To the news he had been fired.

316
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.100
Here's what David Hall wrote that faithful witness talking about

317
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.400
Jonathan Edwards that faithful witness received the

318
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.000
shock unshaken.

319
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.900
I never saw the least symptoms of displeasure in

320
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.100
his countenance his face the

321
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:13.700
whole week.

322
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.700
But he appeared like a man of God.

323
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.000
Who's happiness was out of the reach of his enemies and

324
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.500
whose treasure was not only a future but

325
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.700
a present good.

326
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.200
overbalancing all imaginable ills

327
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.700
of life

328
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.400
Even to the astonishment of many who could

329
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.800
not be at rest without his dismission.

330
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:39.700
Steady, right?

331
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.400
He knew his treasure was something out there that nobody

332
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.300
else could see he's like, what can you do to me?

333
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.300
20 years of faithful Ministry and he gets fired and

334
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.300
he's okay.

335
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.700
Steady faithful to the Lord first and

336
00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.300
foremost because he knew his call was to preach the gospel. He's like,

337
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.300
well, I can do that here or there wherever and he knew that was what his

338
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.100
primary task was. His trust was in

339
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.600
the Lord's hands, but then also steadfast and

340
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.600
confidence in daily life.

341
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.300
No matter what wind comes he's steady.

342
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.900
That's how men should be.

343
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.200
Never to the point of arrogance.

344
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.900
That's not what we're talking about.

345
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.600
But think about Jesus when he was in the garden how he resolved.

346
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.400
I prayed this he said father not my will but your will

347
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:34.600
be done.

348
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.200
Meaning I am in for whatever you have and I'm

349
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.500
gonna stand strong on it.

350
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.400
No matter the cost no matter how painful it is.

351
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.100
I'm Yours God.

352
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.800
steadfastness

353
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.800
You see how different that is in the way of the world.

354
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.100
Because people all around us.

355
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.600
are constantly lying

356
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.500
they're pulled to and fro by these animal impulses that

357
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.600
we have in our flesh. You see that every day around

358
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.700
us. You see gluttons overdoing everything in

359
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.500
our society.

360
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.900
But when Godly men are steady.

361
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.200
Are unmoved even by difficulties in

362
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:23.600
life?

363
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.400
the world takes notice

364
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400
the world notices

365
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.400
that kind of Faith stands out.

366
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.300
In a world that's gone crazy.

367
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.200
There's one more category here in Titus 2 regarding healthy manhood.

368
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.400
It's being self-controlled.

369
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.500
Loving faithful self-controlled.

370
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.500
Now you catch something here that this was the only one

371
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.300
Paul mentioned for the younger men in

372
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:00.600
verse 6.

373
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.800
I'll talk about that more in a second. But but

374
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.000
when you think about what he said to the older men

375
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:07.600
in verse 2

376
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.600
much of what he wrote to them could be

377
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.600
summarized by this phrase self-controlled.

378
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.600
I mean just look at it. He said sober-minded.

379
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.400
That means you're able to clearly think now we know the term

380
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.500
sober and in light of being drunk when you're drunk with

381
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.700
alcohol. You can't clearly think so he's saying being sober-minded it

382
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.500
clear judgment that you can understand the world

383
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.800
and situation you're facing.

384
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.900
dignified

385
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.100
That's a word that means worthy of respect Noble.

386
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.500
Think of those cretans who are lazy gluttons.

387
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.400
Like if you're a lazy Glutton if that's what you're marked as you're not going

388
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.900
to be respected, right?

389
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.600
But really that's that's all summarized by self-control.

390
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.200
You have self-control in your thoughts. You have self control and your actions. Are

391
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.600
you able to manage?

392
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.400
And really self-control is at the root of so many parts

393
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400
of our lives.

394
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.500
That's why he calls it out for the young men

395
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.300
as the only thing.

396
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.000
Like that's the root of all of these other things.

397
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.200
By the way, women listen self-control is not just a male thing, right? This

398
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.400
is for all of us.

399
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.300
Self-control even says it to the women we'll talk about this next week. He says

400
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.200
it in there in verse 5 to be self-control. So this

401
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.800
is a human thing.

402
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.300
Not just men.

403
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.500
But listen guys, I'm speaking as a man. Listen

404
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.500
guys, if you can get this one figured out early.

405
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.500
Man, you're gonna win a lot more of the battles along the way.

406
00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.600
Sadly, that's not my story.

407
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:00.900
as a Young Man

408
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.500
I was out of control in some ways.

409
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.000
When I would be considered a young man here.

410
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.800
I don't need to go in all the details of it, but maybe in maybe in

411
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.000
this moment today. You're feeling that you're out

412
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.200
of control in some area of your life.

413
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.600
It's a helpless feeling, isn't it?

414
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.700
And you know things are just going way off

415
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.200
track.

416
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.100
And you almost feel like you can't do anything about it.

417
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.300
Maybe it's

418
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.500
For you, maybe you're out of control in your finances.

419
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.600
And you're just spending money to try to find significance and

420
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.000
feel some void in your life through spending money.

421
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.100
Or maybe it's in your relationships and it's just out of control. And so

422
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.400
what you do is you run away from everything because you don't want to get hurt.

423
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.300
Or maybe what's out of control in your life is food.

424
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.300
We're pornography or video games or or whatever it is.

425
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.300
You can sense that out of control this in your life,

426
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:11.600
but

427
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.400
hear me here when we talk about self-control. I'm afraid

428
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.200
that we often respond to that feeling of being out of

429
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.700
control by getting self-control wrong.

430
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.000
See, here's what I mean by this.

431
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.000
We hear the word self control all of us have grown up

432
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.300
in this situation like you need self-control and and what we do though

433
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:31.800
with that.

434
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.400
Is we run to rules?

435
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.600
We start to put fences around those

436
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.000
rules.

437
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.600
We doubled down on things. We try harder in

438
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.200
this like we White Knuckle it you know what I

439
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.600
mean by that we squeeze really hard your knuckles turn white you

440
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.200
try and to get this right to make

441
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.900
it happen.

442
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.700
But it doesn't work does it?

443
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.800
I know it doesn't work.

444
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:03.800
I've been there.

445
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.500
Then what happens here? Here's what happens. We we trial these things we build

446
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.400
defenses and then we fail again and we run

447
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.500
and hide and shame.

448
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.700
But listen, all of that that I was just describing that's false self-control

449
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.900
really in the end.

450
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.700
Because what you're doing, what I was doing is just managing a problem

451
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.100
that will eventually destroy you.

452
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.300
Trying to grip it with closed hands because you think

453
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.300
you have self-control over it.

454
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.500
Just just think about first think of those operative words

455
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.100
in that.

456
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:49.500
self

457
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:52.800
control

458
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.000
And we love control don't so so self. Like

459
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.300
that's what we're trying to brute force

460
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.100
it to happen.

461
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:04.900
and control

462
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.300
and manage this problem.

463
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.900
But the way of the Cross is different.

464
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.300
the way the cross

465
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.200
Is exposing it?

466
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.700
being humiliated

467
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.900
having the hard conversation about it.

468
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.300
Not trying to manage it and hide it and and keep it in the

469
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.800
closet back there. No, it's opening that door

470
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.900
to it. And listen. I've been there it is terrifying to

471
00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.800
open your hands up and lose control

472
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.300
because then you don't know what's going to come on

473
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.100
the other side of that.

474
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.300
You have self-control you think I've got this. I know what

475
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.200
I can feel how this is gonna go even though it's out

476
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.100
of control still but you think you have control you open it up and

477
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.200
you're like, I don't know how they're going to respond.

478
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.000
When I confess that I don't know how they're going to

479
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.300
respond when I say that to the church. I don't know how they're going

480
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.700
to handle that. I don't know what that's going to lead to and

481
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.800
it's terrifying.

482
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.600
but in that moment of confession

483
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.200
that moment of vulnerability

484
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.600
that Holy trust in the Lord

485
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.000
what that brings is reconnection.

486
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.900
When you're gripping and hiding your disconnected, but

487
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.700
what that happens when you open it up reconnection happens

488
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.400
with God where you've you've been hiding away from him. And

489
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.400
now he brings you back. You come back to him and

490
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.700
it brings reconnection with others. There's no more secrets

491
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.800
between the two of you and so you are open meaning

492
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.400
reconnect.

493
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.600
You can come back to your father.

494
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.200
Through the shed blood of Jesus where you can

495
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.200
open your hands up and you know your sin and

496
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.200
your shame is covered and that in that you

497
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.700
find true self-control.

498
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.300
We might rename this.

499
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.100
new self control

500
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.300
Colossians 3 says put off the old man

501
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.000
put on the new self.

502
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.400
So when I talk in self-control like grip it make it forced it

503
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.600
into what you want it to be the new self-control is

504
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.200
you're submitting to how God wants to work in

505
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.100
you and change you.

506
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.900
And allow him to work in you right?

507
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.000
See, I don't know how the gospel of grace somehow

508
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.100
got Twisted into something that

509
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.100
forces you to try harder.

510
00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.700
You understand what I'm saying about like.

511
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.100
Yeah, we're saved by grace, but then you better make it

512
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.300
happen the rest of your life.

513
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.300
What did Jesus say?

514
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.400
Matthew 11

515
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.600
:28 through 30.

516
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.200
Come to me.

517
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.100
All who labor and are heavy

518
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.300
laden. I will give you rest.

519
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.400
Take my yoke my my burden upon you

520
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.500
and learn from me for I am gentle and

521
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.600
lowly in heart and you'll find rest for

522
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.700
your souls.

523
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.000
For my yoke is easy in my burden is light.

524
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.900
Don't turn self control into something. It's not.

525
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.200
Remember self control Galatians 5

526
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.400
is a fruit of God's spirit within you.

527
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.900
He produces it in you and so

528
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.900
the only way you get it is by

529
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.100
abiding in him.

530
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.300
It's by by dying to

531
00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.400
self opening your hands and letting him

532
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.100
have control.

533
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.500
of that situation of your whole life

534
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.400
and when you do that, you'll see your ability to

535
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.400
overcome Temptation grow and grow and grow.

536
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.700
Not because you've got it figured out and you've got it tried harder

537
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.200
to get there.

538
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.600
But because you've released it and said Jesus is yours.

539
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.700
So I know that all this is not a comprehensive definition of Godly

540
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.200
manhood.

541
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.700
But see how a loving faithful self-controlled

542
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.800
kind of life is so

543
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.700
different than the way of the world.

544
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.500
Like just imagine a bunch of men walking around our

545
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.000
church.

546
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.900
Living like that.

547
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.100
Leading their families like that.

548
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.000
Being single like that.

549
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.400
Like it is that not a powerful picture of

550
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.900
what God could do through men saying Jesus. We're

551
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.100
yours.

552
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.600
Our church would be better for that. Our homes would

553
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.000
be better for that. Our world would be better because of

554
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.200
that.

555
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.400
And so that's the picture of man, but here's the thing back in Crete.

556
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.300
They didn't have many if any good

557
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.500
examples of what that looks like.

558
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.400
Remember what cretans are?

559
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.500
Liars evil beasts lazy gluttons, that's all they were. And

560
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.600
so now they're like, okay, what does this look like Paul? So Paul

561
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.300
then calls Titus to be an example.

562
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.100
Titus is coming in kind of from the outside. He might have been from Crete but

563
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.600
but most likely he's he's been somewhere else for a while. He's coming back there and

564
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.100
he says Paul says to Titus you need

565
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.200
to set the pace man.

566
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.900
Find Elders who can set the pace, but you've got to do it.

567
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.800
That's what he says in verses 7 and 8 saying show yourself.

568
00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.600
That's a singular word to tie to show yourself in

569
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.800
all respects to be a model of good works in your

570
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.400
teaching show Integrity dignity and sound speech that

571
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.300
cannot be condemned. So an opponent maybe put to

572
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.700
shame having nothing evil to say about us.

573
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.900
You see what he said show yourself.

574
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.300
Not pridefully not arrogantly.

575
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.600
They needed someone to be a model for them.

576
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.200
The Greek word there is two paws from which we get our

577
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.000
word type.

578
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.000
Like you type you see marks show up. It's the example of

579
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.200
Jesus seen even

580
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.400
in the Old Testament through Moses and these things like those look like Jesus

581
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.800
a little bit. That's the idea of type.

582
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.400
It's What's Happening Here? We needed someone to be an example. Like

583
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.800
in First Peter. 5:3 Elders are to be an example to

584
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.600
the flock. It's the same kind of idea.

585
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.000
so older men he says

586
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.200
Titus you do this older men though, but also women you

587
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.800
are also supposed to do this to be an

588
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.100
example.

589
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.400
To those who go behind you. This is all we're talking about we're talking about disciple making

590
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.400
That you just set an example. You live a life that someone can

591
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.300
follow say oh, that's what it looks like to follow Jesus. That's what

592
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.200
we're talking about here. He says to tie to show

593
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.800
yourself to be an example of the things God's designed

594
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.200
us to do.

595
00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.200
They need to see it Titus. They need to see what it looks

596
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.300
like to follow Jesus.

597
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.500
And do it in a way that no one can speak badly. That's about

598
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.700
the the above reproach idea from chapter one, like do

599
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.400
it in a way that no one can criticize that you don't

600
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.100
actually do what you say you're doing

601
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.000
but hear me young people.

602
00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.600
This is not just for the older women. Older men

603
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.200
to leaders in the church. Don't hear that that

604
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.500
is it because Paul also had a guy in

605
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.100
Ephesus. His name was Timothy.

606
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.300
Timothy is a young guy.

607
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.200
Similar to Titus in Crete. This is what Paul said

608
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.600
to Timothy in 1st Timothy 4:12. He says

609
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.500
let no one despise you for your youth.

610
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:21.400
but

611
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.600
set the Believers an example.

612
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.700
In speech in conduct in love in faith

613
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.100
impurity.

614
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.600
Doesn't matter how old you are.

615
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.600
Set an example.

616
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.000
But listen, the only way you can do that.

617
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.800
Is if you have been transformed by Jesus first.

618
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.400
Again, we're not saying try harder make you make sure you be an

619
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.300
example. We're saying be transformed by Jesus. So

620
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.000
you are an example. You cannot manufacture this kind of

621
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.600
Lifestyle.

622
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.400
It only happens. If God has put a

623
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.000
new heart and a new spirit inside you by faith

624
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.000
in his life death and Resurrection in your place.

625
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.200
That he's made you a new creation a new self control, right?

626
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.300
Where you remember? You're loved not because of what you

627
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.000
have done or what you have performed for him.

628
00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.700
That he loves you.

629
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.300
Even before you could anyway earn it. He loves you

630
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.400
even when you were his enemy he loves you.

631
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.600
And when you remember that.

632
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.300
Now even even with the new heart, I understand. Yes, we're

633
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.200
going to to have our flesh still there. We're gonna fall into

634
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.700
temptation from time to time all of that. But in that

635
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.200
as we lean on the Lord, he works in

636
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.000
our lives. He changes us. He makes us new

637
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.000
which then allows you to turn around and be an example to those who are behind

638
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.300
you.

639
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.200
In the Journey of Faith now, I might say

640
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.400
behind you. It may be one step like you you're only

641
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.700
one step ahead of them. But but you know something they don't know.

642
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.500
You don't have to have a degree from Seminary to

643
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.400
be an example to be a leader to make disciples. It doesn't

644
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.300
demand that it all it demands is that you are taking steps forward

645
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.800
and someone's one step behind you.

646
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.300
And able to walk with you and follow you towards.

647
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:21.900
Jesus

648
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.600
And again, all of this plays out not just theoretically.

649
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.700
Not just in the church all this plays out in

650
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:34.600
Daily Life.

651
00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.300
Right. This this is this is an example. We set not

652
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.500
just by talking about it in here. This is an example we set in

653
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:43.900
life.

654
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.700
Remember those false teachers the pagans and Crete.

655
00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.400
They were living this completely opposite life. The Christian's

656
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.000
life was supposed to be set apart.

657
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.200
And notice Paul here in verses 9 and 10.

658
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.600
It seems like it's out of touch. It's out of like just

659
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.400
offshoot somewhere. No, he talks about these Bond

660
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.900
servants and verses 9 and 10.

661
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.000
This is one example.

662
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.400
Of how this worked out for a Christian, even if

663
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.800
they were a slave and had an unbelieving Master.

664
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.300
He's like saying in the worst case scenario this

665
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.900
still works.

666
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.500
Watch this look at verses 9 and 10 again.

667
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.300
Bond servants are to be submissive to their own masters in everything

668
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.000
there to be well pleasing not argumentative not

669
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.300
pilfering stealing but showing all

670
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.000
good faith. So that everything they may Adorn

671
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.500
the doctrine of God our savior.

672
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.900
He's like this is an example.

673
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.500
In contrast to other Bond servants

674
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.700
who would have been arguing who had been subversive who

675
00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.500
would have been all kinds of Thieves.

676
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.300
He says Christian Bond servants.

677
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.100
If you're a Christian and you're in that situation you are to Adorn

678
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.900
the gospel.

679
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:14.100
The Greek word there is cosmeo where

680
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.600
we get the root word of cosmetics.

681
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.400
It's the word Adorn to make it in other words to make the

682
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.500
gospel of God as beautiful as possible.

683
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.300
It already is but we make it so attractive by

684
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.500
our lives that they're so

685
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.000
different that people are saying I want what you have.

686
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.900
What is it that you have that something so precious

687
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.100
to you?

688
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.400
And changed you so much. I want that.

689
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.300
So what Martin Luther said 500 years ago, he said because the

690
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.400
Lost cannot see our faith that's

691
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.800
internal right? It's a faith inside. He

692
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.100
says they ought to see our works.

693
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.400
Then hear our Doctrine and then they

694
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.300
might be converted.

695
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.500
They can't see what we believe.

696
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.100
But they can see our lives.

697
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.300
then they might listen and then they might

698
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:13.500
believe

699
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.600
that's his order of operation there.

700
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.200
And so listen men, this is again. We'll talk about next week

701
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.700
with women but men today.

702
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.500
Are you pursuing a Godly vision of manhood?

703
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.500
Or are you pursuing the world's Vision a manhood?

704
00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.300
Hear me in all this. I'm not implying that that men should

705
00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:41.800
be soft.

706
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.500
Men should be weak.

707
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.000
Because remember our ultimate example of this is Jesus.

708
00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.400
The man who showed us strength under

709
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.000
control his entire life.

710
00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.500
He wasn't weak. He wasn't soft.

711
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.500
He had all the strength and power in the in universe.

712
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.300
And he kept it under control the entire time.

713
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.700
See we need men to step up and bring Justice

714
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.500
and gladly assume responsibility in

715
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.200
life. Yes. We just better do that with

716
00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.000
love and faithfulness and self-control.

717
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.200
That's how we go about that task. I mean just think about

718
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.000
how safe.

719
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.000
People would feel around you.

720
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.800
If these things marked your life.

721
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:38.000
If you're a known as a man who's loving and faithful and

722
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.100
self new self-controlled.

723
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.800
Your wife your kids your friends

724
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.900
your coworkers would feel safe.

725
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.900
Because that's who you are.

726
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.800
What an example of Jesus to those people?

727
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.600
So just think about analyzing yourself Psalm 139. Ask God

728
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.300
to show us our hearts analyze Yourself In

729
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:06.700
This Moment.

730
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.400
Do you lead with sacrificial generosity?

731
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.800
giving of yourself

732
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.200
Do you model faithfulness to God and to the

733
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.500
people that he is entrusted to you? Are you consistent and

734
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.200
faithful to them?

735
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.400
Are you rock solid stable when the Winds of

736
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.800
Life come your way. Are you are you steady?

737
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.500
And are you opening your hands with your lust your

738
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.300
Temptation? Whatever you opening your hands to

739
00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.300
Jesus with it and saying this is yours.

740
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.300
If those things Mark you welcome to

741
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:51.700
manhood.

742
00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.400
It's what it is.

743
00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.900
It has nothing to do with how tough guy you are.

744
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.200
Or whether you like sports or guns or not, like

745
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.200
it has nothing to do with any of that stuff. You can go ahead and like that stuff.

746
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.000
There's nothing wrong with that. Just don't make those extra biblical

747
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.700
things your standard of manhood.

748
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.100
Like you're you're example in your mind should be Jesus not John Wayne.

749
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.000
Should be Jesus loving faithful self-control because

750
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.500
Godly manhood is different than worldly. Manhood.

751
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.300
It looks completely different. We've seen

752
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.200
it all day. So instead of pursuing the ways of

753
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.600
the crowds around us.

754
00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.800
Let's set an example of what it means to pursue

755
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.500
Jesus with our entire hearts.

756
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.400
Leaning on the blood of Jesus when we fail

757
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:47.700
at that.

758
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.200
Because you will I will.

759
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.400
We need Grace. We need his love. We need his blood to cover

760
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.200
us. But also as we do that adorning the

761
00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:58.700
gospel.

762
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.200
with a transformed kind of life
