00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:07.125
Well, church, it's always a great day to get to see this,

2
00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:12.445
uh, act of obedience, this illustration of salvation.

3
00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:15.325
And so we get to celebrate with the Greenlaw family today.

4
00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:17.525
This is Elliot just had a birthday Thursday,

5
00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:21.525
but we get to celebrate a spiritual marker in his life

6
00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:24.965
as he came to faith and just continued to follow.

7
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:27.765
Jesus wanted to express that publicly

8
00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:29.365
through this act of baptism.

9
00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:31.965
So we're here today to celebrate with him to do that.

10
00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:35.405
Uh, it's a symbol again of what God has done in his heart,

11
00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:40.965
that spiritually dead, now alive, kind of buried

12
00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:44.765
with Christ, raised in him to follow him the rest

13
00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:47.085
of his life so we can celebrate that today

14
00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.005
and to honor Christ in what he's done.

15
00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:53.485
And so, Elliot, based on your profession of faith, I get

16
00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:56.165
to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son,

17
00:00:56.185 --> 00:00:57.205
and the Holy Spirit.

18
00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:05.325
Amen. Amen.

19
00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:08.765
God, thank you for this, this celebration.

20
00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.165
It's not the act of salvation.

21
00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.325
It is what you've already done in his heart

22
00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:18.565
and life forever choosing and drawing, and now redeeming

23
00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:22.365
and assuring guaranteeing his salvation forever and ever

24
00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:24.405
because of what Christ has done for him

25
00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:26.005
and his life, death and resurrection.

26
00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:28.845
But Lord, this is an act of obedience.

27
00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.605
It's an act of illustration. It's a declaration.

28
00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:35.925
So this is one step of that for the rest of Elliot's life.

29
00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:38.725
God, I pray that his family has done such a good job

30
00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:39.805
pointing him to you.

31
00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:43.045
I pray as a church we would do the same, to continue

32
00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:46.045
to point him in the direction of the path

33
00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:47.925
of righteousness found in you alone, Christ.

34
00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.245
Fill him with your spirit. Help him

35
00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.005
to look to you in all things.

36
00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:55.285
In Jesus' name, amen.

37
00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:58.125
Amen. Amen. If you would stand with.
