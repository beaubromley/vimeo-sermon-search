1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Friday's been kind of hard.

2
00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:04.245
It's been a stressful day of work,

3
00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:08.725
and I've spent the last like, um, 30 minutes just trying

4
00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:10.245
to decompress from what's happened.

5
00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:13.205
So it's okay. Not every day is good.

6
00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:15.925
Some days are hard, but it's good that we're here.

7
00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:18.045
Uh, we get study the work together.

8
00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:22.005
Um, we get to look at how good our God is

9
00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:26.845
and, um, examine, uh, Jesus in

10
00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:29.245
a new way tonight that allows us

11
00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:30.925
to just worship him even more.

12
00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:34.285
So, let's go ahead and pray as we get started.

13
00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:37.765
Uh, focus our hearts. Some. We're gonna learn tonight.

14
00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:39.765
Lord God, we love you.

15
00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:44.765
We are still, um, so grateful,

16
00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:49.605
uh, for your desire for us.

17
00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.085
We're thankful for the salvation that we have.

18
00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:58.005
And you, we love, uh,

19
00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:02.245
the salvation that you've given to us, that we are sinners

20
00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:04.285
and we bring nothing to the table.

21
00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:07.325
And yet you are gracious and you are good.

22
00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:12.725
It's you. Make a way for us to be called your sons

23
00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:15.485
and daughters and eternally be in your family.

24
00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:19.445
God, we, uh, we invite your spirit.

25
00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:24.245
Not that you need our invitation, you can work as, uh,

26
00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:27.365
as you please, but we invite you to come.

27
00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:29.085
We ask that you will come

28
00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:31.885
and your spirit will, um, speak to us tonight

29
00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:36.685
as we examine your word, as you reveal things to us, uh,

30
00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:39.925
uh, in our own hearts, in our own lives.

31
00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:44.085
Uh, reveal things through the experience in the world

32
00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:46.365
around us, and shape those thoughts

33
00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:49.365
and those experiences by your word to see you more rightly

34
00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:52.005
and to glorify your son Jesus.

35
00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:53.765
That's our prayer. We love you

36
00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:54.925
and your son's gonna

37
00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:59.765
pray well.

38
00:01:59.835 --> 00:02:01.645
Just a couple matters of housekeeping.

39
00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:03.845
Thanksgiving is next week.

40
00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:05.805
I know that caught me by supplies today

41
00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:06.965
when I looked at the calendar.

42
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:09.885
Can't believe that this already next week.

43
00:02:10.185 --> 00:02:14.245
Uh, so we will, uh, we'll not have, uh, our class next week.

44
00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:16.805
We'll be closed on Wednesday for Thanksgiving.

45
00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:19.805
So, um, hopefully get some time celebrating

46
00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:23.245
with some loved ones and friends on Thanksgiving next week.

47
00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:27.165
Get some time of rest. Uh, mark, I believe the week

48
00:02:27.175 --> 00:02:31.485
after that we will be meeting as a recap for this semester.

49
00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:34.685
Is that fair? In our last official meeting in here. Okay.

50
00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:39.925
For the seminary students. We'll have one more online. Okay.

51
00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:42.245
So next, not next week, but the week after.

52
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.765
We'll be back here, uh, to recap

53
00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:46.645
what we've learned over this semester,

54
00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:50.765
but just a recap of what we've learned so far.

55
00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:55.425
Um, so going back to August when we started,

56
00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:00.205
um, we've, we've gone through several, um, doctrines.

57
00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:03.245
We've looked in depth these doctrines over the course

58
00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.645
of several weeks, just as a reminder of things

59
00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:06.965
that we've examined in here together.

60
00:03:07.015 --> 00:03:10.045
We've studied the doctrine of the word of God.

61
00:03:11.215 --> 00:03:15.765
We've studied the doctrine of who God is, uh, his existence,

62
00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:20.285
his no ability, his attributes, his communicable

63
00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:21.805
and incommunicable attributes.

64
00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:24.325
And we've looked at the doctrine of the trinity Together.

65
00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:28.925
We've examined the works of God and his creation

66
00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:30.205
and his providence.

67
00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:33.525
We've looked at the works of God and his miracles.

68
00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:35.965
Uh, we've looked at prayer.

69
00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:38.325
Steve led us that night, uh,

70
00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:40.885
angelic beings in spiritual realm.

71
00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:42.245
I remember Jacob meeting us

72
00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:43.685
through a discussion at the end of that.

73
00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:46.045
And then over the last two weeks,

74
00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:47.445
we looked at the doctrine of man.

75
00:03:47.445 --> 00:03:48.525
Trevor led one week.

76
00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:51.805
And then we looked last week at what, uh, what it means

77
00:03:51.805 --> 00:03:55.285
to be male and female and how that applies to us

78
00:03:55.345 --> 00:03:56.645
as image bearers of God.

79
00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:00.965
So all of that framework that we've studied together so far

80
00:04:01.555 --> 00:04:03.085
this semester brings us to the night

81
00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:05.925
where we're gonna study the doctrine of sin.

82
00:04:07.745 --> 00:04:10.925
So having spent the last several weeks examining the

83
00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:14.605
holiness of God, we looked at how the glory

84
00:04:14.745 --> 00:04:17.165
of Yahweh is on display and his creation.

85
00:04:17.985 --> 00:04:20.125
And then specifically over these last two weeks,

86
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.965
we were able to discuss at the link God's intention

87
00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:26.485
for his glory and his wisdom to be on display in humans

88
00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:27.605
as his image bearers.

89
00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:30.245
That all brings us to tonight.

90
00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:34.085
So why do you think, just as an intro question

91
00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:37.605
to tonight's topic, why do you think it's necessary, uh,

92
00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:40.125
to have a solid understanding of those subjects

93
00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:42.445
that we've looked at so far this semester?

94
00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:47.045
His word, who got it, his, his works on display.

95
00:04:48.145 --> 00:04:49.805
Why is it good to have a solid understanding

96
00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:53.005
of those subjects before we study the concept

97
00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:54.685
of sin and its consequences?

98
00:04:54.915 --> 00:04:57.205
What do you think what you got?

99
00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:00.005
'cause sin, basically, whenever we go

100
00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:01.645
against God's intention

101
00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:04.085
Way That he work, that

102
00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:07.765
is God's intentions against his design.

103
00:05:11.235 --> 00:05:12.245
What else is it important

104
00:05:13.235 --> 00:05:14.965
Puts us in our rightful place?

105
00:05:15.955 --> 00:05:20.205
Yeah, that's good. Let's elaborate on that.

106
00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:23.125
What, what is our rightful place? What do we mean by that?

107
00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:26.845
We aren't God, I heard something. We aren't God.

108
00:05:27.115 --> 00:05:29.125
Yeah. That we aren't God. It's good.

109
00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:33.205
Have a solid understanding of who God is

110
00:05:33.545 --> 00:05:35.525
and how other he is from us.

111
00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:36.955
It's good.

112
00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:41.005
Anything else? Understanding his own.

113
00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:45.725
And it helps his understand sin better when we think,

114
00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:51.765
when we understand who He's and how perfect He's,

115
00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:55.645
and it's, you know, it's just a,

116
00:05:57.355 --> 00:05:58.355
Yeah.

117
00:05:59.035 --> 00:06:01.605
Yeah. It's, it's kind of establishing that standard.

118
00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:03.845
Like we don't have the standard to look at.

119
00:06:03.915 --> 00:06:07.245
It's really hard to build any sort of framework around that.

120
00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:10.405
Right. Other thoughts?

121
00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:14.245
I mean, you should want to, if you love something,

122
00:06:14.305 --> 00:06:16.565
you should want know as much as you possibly can.

123
00:06:16.745 --> 00:06:20.365
That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully you guys have seen that.

124
00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:22.165
I know I've seen that over the last few

125
00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:23.325
weeks studying this together.

126
00:06:23.665 --> 00:06:26.085
Um, the more we look at God

127
00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:29.125
and the more we, um, take in who he is

128
00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:30.485
and what he's done, our love

129
00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:32.085
and our adoration for him grows.

130
00:06:32.085 --> 00:06:34.405
Right? And that's good to have that love

131
00:06:34.405 --> 00:06:38.885
and adoration for God before we look at this concept of sin.

132
00:06:39.445 --> 00:06:40.445
'cause it helps ground us

133
00:06:41.105 --> 00:06:45.485
and what, um, what the good standard is, right?

134
00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:48.645
What to look forward to. Yeah.

135
00:06:48.885 --> 00:06:51.405
Although God and his holiness

136
00:06:51.425 --> 00:06:55.605
and wisdom, as we've seen, created a perfectly good universe

137
00:06:56.555 --> 00:06:57.925
that was designed to reflect

138
00:06:57.925 --> 00:07:01.445
and share his glory, what we'll see tonight is

139
00:07:01.445 --> 00:07:04.805
that his created image bearers as well as some angels.

140
00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:06.765
We don't want to disregard that fact,

141
00:07:06.865 --> 00:07:08.205
but, um, us

142
00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:11.525
as his image bearers rejected his design and authority.

143
00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:16.805
And we choose to be like God by the fit,

144
00:07:16.905 --> 00:07:18.645
by defining wisdom for ourselves.

145
00:07:18.825 --> 00:07:21.325
In essence, that's what we're gonna be looking at tonight.

146
00:07:21.325 --> 00:07:25.205
When we look at the concept of sin at its core.

147
00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:26.325
That's, that's what it is.

148
00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:31.205
And the study tonight, um, sin from its definition,

149
00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:32.725
how do we define sin?

150
00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:34.645
We'll put some framework around that.

151
00:07:35.495 --> 00:07:38.245
We'll look at how sin plays out in its nature

152
00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:41.845
and in our nature, and then we'll look at the results,

153
00:07:41.945 --> 00:07:44.805
the consequences, uh, the punishment for sin.

154
00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:50.245
Our, uh, key verse for tonight is Romans five 12.

155
00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:53.325
I think you have that, uh, on your card.

156
00:07:53.385 --> 00:07:56.565
So let's, let's read that together tonight

157
00:07:57.905 --> 00:08:01.725
as someone read Romans five 12 for us.

158
00:08:04.075 --> 00:08:06.485
Therefore, just the sin came into the world

159
00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:09.325
through one man and death through sin.

160
00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:13.085
And so death spread to all men, because all sin.

161
00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:18.525
Yeah. We're gonna look at this in

162
00:08:18.525 --> 00:08:19.565
depth in just a little bit.

163
00:08:19.905 --> 00:08:22.045
Um, and really what the, what the real meaning

164
00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:23.405
behind this verse is.

165
00:08:23.705 --> 00:08:26.325
And we'll see it in context too as we look together tonight.

166
00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:28.685
But let's take a step back from there.

167
00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:32.005
So sin, if you just think about it, sin is not a word

168
00:08:32.005 --> 00:08:34.445
that we just use in common language outside

169
00:08:34.445 --> 00:08:37.645
of Christian biblical culture, right?

170
00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:42.365
At work. If someone, you know, steals

171
00:08:42.365 --> 00:08:45.725
and takes credit for something that you produce,

172
00:08:46.235 --> 00:08:47.525
it's not like you go to your boss

173
00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:51.285
and say, man, Tommy over here really sinned against me

174
00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:52.525
by stealing my work.

175
00:08:52.825 --> 00:08:55.845
You know, it's not just that, it's not a common word

176
00:08:55.845 --> 00:08:57.365
that we use in our everyday language.

177
00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.085
So if you were to go out, let's say you went out

178
00:09:00.085 --> 00:09:04.445
to the street and you did this whole, um, family feud stuff,

179
00:09:04.475 --> 00:09:07.405
hold a hundred people, uh, well,

180
00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:09.525
how do you think they would answer the question?

181
00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:13.005
What is sim just a hundred, a hundred brand new people?

182
00:09:13.675 --> 00:09:14.685
What do you think they would say?

183
00:09:19.845 --> 00:09:23.085
Disobedience to God. Disobedience to God? Yeah.

184
00:09:23.705 --> 00:09:26.285
Things like murder. Yeah, murder.

185
00:09:29.605 --> 00:09:30.605
Anything Just generally bad.

186
00:09:30.955 --> 00:09:32.525
Just I would say most people

187
00:09:32.525 --> 00:09:36.325
of probably don't think too much of like sin.

188
00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:40.605
What a very generic answer. Just tell them that.

189
00:09:40.755 --> 00:09:44.005
Yeah. Doing bad ways. Right? That's good.

190
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.525
What do you think, what sins are seen as the worst

191
00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:51.645
by humans across the world,

192
00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:55.205
or maybe even throughout history?

193
00:09:56.035 --> 00:09:58.565
What do you think people generally say?

194
00:09:58.565 --> 00:10:00.605
These are just, that's the worst kind

195
00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:02.725
Type of state. Murder,

196
00:10:03.385 --> 00:10:05.245
Murder, that one's pretty universally, right?

197
00:10:05.755 --> 00:10:08.085
Harming children. Harming children.

198
00:10:11.755 --> 00:10:15.045
What else? Anything else? Make that top list

199
00:10:17.235 --> 00:10:19.805
That, That stealing?

200
00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.565
Yeah, I think if you were to ask most people, they would,

201
00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:28.165
their framework around sand would revolve

202
00:10:28.165 --> 00:10:29.565
around kind of those things, right?

203
00:10:29.785 --> 00:10:30.805
Really bad things.

204
00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:34.245
Um, But we are,

205
00:10:34.245 --> 00:10:37.325
we're gonna look at sin tonight from a biblical standpoint.

206
00:10:37.465 --> 00:10:40.125
So get a better idea, better definition of

207
00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:41.285
what sin truly is.

208
00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:45.605
Gda, in the book, we've been studying to find sin

209
00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:49.725
as any failure to conform to the moral law of God

210
00:10:50.785 --> 00:10:53.525
and act attitude or nature.

211
00:10:54.865 --> 00:10:57.645
So if we, if we look at that definition that he provides,

212
00:10:57.645 --> 00:11:00.405
there's a few assumptions that, um, we can

213
00:11:01.085 --> 00:11:02.445
derive from that definition.

214
00:11:03.985 --> 00:11:06.245
The first assumption that we could derive is

215
00:11:06.245 --> 00:11:08.925
that God sits in the seat of authority to define

216
00:11:08.925 --> 00:11:10.605
what is good and what is not good.

217
00:11:12.145 --> 00:11:15.605
So if we say the moral law of God, that assumes

218
00:11:15.605 --> 00:11:17.565
that God is the one who is defining

219
00:11:17.565 --> 00:11:19.045
what is good and what is not good.

220
00:11:20.145 --> 00:11:21.885
But there's assumptions that go beyond that.

221
00:11:22.705 --> 00:11:25.965
We assume that as the creator of all things

222
00:11:26.025 --> 00:11:29.285
and the origin of all things, that anything

223
00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:31.645
and everything that God does is good.

224
00:11:31.715 --> 00:11:34.405
It's not just good or not good

225
00:11:34.405 --> 00:11:36.805
because he declared it to be good.

226
00:11:36.835 --> 00:11:38.325
Like he wrote it down as a list.

227
00:11:39.155 --> 00:11:41.765
It's because He, whatever he does, anything

228
00:11:41.765 --> 00:11:44.125
and everything that he does by nature is good.

229
00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:48.725
Going a little bit further than that, we would assume

230
00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:50.525
that anything and everything

231
00:11:51.235 --> 00:11:55.325
that exists in God's nature is good just by matter

232
00:11:55.385 --> 00:11:56.405
of existence.

233
00:11:57.065 --> 00:11:58.805
If God is the origin of all things,

234
00:11:58.955 --> 00:12:03.085
just everything in His nature is essentially good

235
00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:06.045
because he is from what everything comes from.

236
00:12:08.545 --> 00:12:11.485
The next assumption that we could make from that is

237
00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:14.525
that if there is a, that there is a moral law,

238
00:12:14.865 --> 00:12:18.525
and that moral law exists because God exists.

239
00:12:19.855 --> 00:12:22.345
This is an important distinction to make, that, um,

240
00:12:22.585 --> 00:12:25.705
a moral law was not created by God.

241
00:12:25.935 --> 00:12:28.185
It's not something that he came up with.

242
00:12:29.125 --> 00:12:31.505
It simply exists because God exists.

243
00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.225
If God exists, there is a moral law.

244
00:12:34.225 --> 00:12:37.985
Because everything that God does, everything that He is,

245
00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:42.345
is the moral law of what is the standard of what

246
00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.345
that moral law is.

247
00:12:44.415 --> 00:12:46.465
They are the moral law is not rules

248
00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:49.545
or laws that God has created and could

249
00:12:49.545 --> 00:12:51.305
therefore alter recklessly.

250
00:12:51.725 --> 00:12:55.185
But they're instead immutable, dependable qualities

251
00:12:55.245 --> 00:12:57.385
of his nature reflected in our universe.

252
00:12:58.455 --> 00:13:01.745
They exist because God exists, not because God created them

253
00:13:01.765 --> 00:13:03.065
or recognized them later.

254
00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:06.425
This moral law is absolutely true

255
00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:08.945
and fundamental to reality.

256
00:13:10.965 --> 00:13:14.425
The next assumption that we could derive in is

257
00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:18.145
that God's will defines what is morally good.

258
00:13:18.685 --> 00:13:20.305
If it is in God's will,

259
00:13:21.525 --> 00:13:25.545
and God will something to be that it is morally good if

260
00:13:26.365 --> 00:13:27.705
as it is with God's will.

261
00:13:29.085 --> 00:13:31.665
On the surface, that sounds easy and of course,

262
00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.825
but we'll see some situations where that is hard

263
00:13:35.365 --> 00:13:36.825
and it's hard to reckon with.

264
00:13:38.325 --> 00:13:40.505
The next assumption that we can make is that anything

265
00:13:40.655 --> 00:13:43.585
outside of God's will is morally wrong.

266
00:13:46.765 --> 00:13:49.825
And then the last assumption is God's will.

267
00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:53.065
That humanity follows his design for life

268
00:13:53.885 --> 00:13:56.705
and relationship with him and with others.

269
00:13:59.045 --> 00:14:00.065
And so if we've assumed

270
00:14:00.085 --> 00:14:03.865
before that God's will is morally good, anything that falls

271
00:14:04.015 --> 00:14:05.705
outside of his will

272
00:14:05.705 --> 00:14:09.985
and his design for humanity is in essence morally wrong.

273
00:14:11.445 --> 00:14:15.465
So Gruden goes on to explain that sin, when examined

274
00:14:15.465 --> 00:14:17.825
by this definition, presents itself in three ways.

275
00:14:18.445 --> 00:14:21.665
And action. That would be the things that we do.

276
00:14:22.555 --> 00:14:23.945
These are the behavioral things.

277
00:14:24.105 --> 00:14:26.425
A lot of the examples we came up with, stealing, murder,

278
00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:31.385
lying, gossip, cheating, but not just in action

279
00:14:31.385 --> 00:14:34.505
or behavior, but it presents itself in attitude.

280
00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:39.745
This would be the things that we desire, envy, covetousness,

281
00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:42.985
hatred, lust, selfishness.

282
00:14:45.045 --> 00:14:49.105
And then also sin presents itself in moral nature.

283
00:14:49.845 --> 00:14:51.565
So the internal character

284
00:14:51.565 --> 00:14:54.685
or essence of who we are as persons,

285
00:14:56.265 --> 00:14:57.325
we see this in scripture.

286
00:14:57.435 --> 00:14:59.525
Just a couple of brief comments,

287
00:14:59.545 --> 00:15:01.085
and we'll get into this a little bit more later.

288
00:15:01.235 --> 00:15:02.365
Ephesians two, three.

289
00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:06.125
Paul states, we were by nature children of wr.

290
00:15:07.305 --> 00:15:10.125
He says, again, in Romans five, eight, while we were

291
00:15:10.225 --> 00:15:12.685
yet sinners, Christ died for us.

292
00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:16.845
It's not, he doesn't use the term why we were yet sinning

293
00:15:16.945 --> 00:15:18.845
as if it was just based on our actions.

294
00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:22.965
But he talks about the essence of actually who we are,

295
00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:24.605
defined as sinners.

296
00:15:24.945 --> 00:15:26.085
Christ died for us.

297
00:15:27.665 --> 00:15:31.765
So these three, if we look at sin from those three angles,

298
00:15:32.675 --> 00:15:34.445
they help to build a frame, a framework

299
00:15:34.465 --> 00:15:36.685
for understanding the full scope of sin.

300
00:15:37.985 --> 00:15:39.565
But Ultimately, we haven't really talked about

301
00:15:39.595 --> 00:15:41.525
what is sin at its core.

302
00:15:42.175 --> 00:15:45.565
We've kind of said it shows up in these in these ways.

303
00:15:46.545 --> 00:15:49.805
But ultimately, what is sin at its core?

304
00:15:51.845 --> 00:15:53.245
I just ask this question to you all.

305
00:15:53.265 --> 00:15:55.485
Do you believe that there's an underlying thread

306
00:15:55.485 --> 00:15:57.445
that weave into the fabric of all sin?

307
00:16:02.885 --> 00:16:04.785
Do you see one or do you have ideas of what

308
00:16:04.785 --> 00:16:05.865
that might look like?

309
00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:10.905
It's putting our will above God's will.

310
00:16:11.565 --> 00:16:13.345
That's a good, that's really Good answer.

311
00:16:14.205 --> 00:16:15.265
The will above God's will.

312
00:16:15.965 --> 00:16:17.345
I'm trying to think of, you know,

313
00:16:17.345 --> 00:16:19.585
how Jesus says like he's the life I think of it,

314
00:16:19.685 --> 00:16:22.825
sin is the absence of life sense.

315
00:16:23.295 --> 00:16:27.905
Yeah. Because if God himself is light anything outside

316
00:16:27.905 --> 00:16:28.265
of God,

317
00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:35.065
let me ask you a question.

318
00:16:35.275 --> 00:16:36.985
Might go back a couple weeks on this one,

319
00:16:36.985 --> 00:16:38.665
but what is the chief end of me?

320
00:16:42.315 --> 00:16:44.515
Glorify God, Glorify God,

321
00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:48.515
Enjoy him, Enjoy it, and enjoy him eternally.

322
00:16:49.305 --> 00:16:52.755
Yeah. So going back a couple weeks, when Trevor led us,

323
00:16:53.735 --> 00:16:56.675
we looked at how humans were designed as image bearers,

324
00:16:56.675 --> 00:16:58.315
but we were designed ultimately to worship.

325
00:17:00.525 --> 00:17:04.635
Truthfully, all of creation is, is designed to worship God,

326
00:17:05.335 --> 00:17:07.475
but specifically humans were designed to worship.

327
00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:10.995
And we weren't just designed to worship anything.

328
00:17:11.015 --> 00:17:12.515
We were designed to worship God

329
00:17:12.545 --> 00:17:14.555
that created both individually

330
00:17:15.015 --> 00:17:17.795
and then us, also collectively as a species

331
00:17:18.695 --> 00:17:21.875
or to ate together, bear his image and worship him.

332
00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:24.795
We are designed in this way.

333
00:17:25.815 --> 00:17:28.195
But if man will not worship godly creator,

334
00:17:29.065 --> 00:17:31.355
what do you think fills that vacuum of adoration

335
00:17:31.355 --> 00:17:33.195
that we were designed to express?

336
00:17:37.005 --> 00:17:39.345
So in other words, ask a simple, simple way.

337
00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:41.905
If we don't worship God, are we gonna worship something

338
00:17:42.335 --> 00:17:43.335
Safe?

339
00:17:44.385 --> 00:17:48.785
I heard some answers say, say yeah, ourselves.

340
00:17:49.395 --> 00:17:53.845
Yeah. It's kind of like, um,

341
00:17:54.945 --> 00:17:56.245
I'm thinking a really bad analogy.

342
00:17:57.265 --> 00:18:01.485
Um, a car is designed to drive, right?

343
00:18:01.745 --> 00:18:05.405
That's what it's made to do. We are designed to worship.

344
00:18:05.535 --> 00:18:06.645
We're made to worship.

345
00:18:07.185 --> 00:18:08.205
So just

346
00:18:08.205 --> 00:18:10.125
because we're not going, if we don't worship God,

347
00:18:10.135 --> 00:18:13.365
we're gonna still be worshiping by design.

348
00:18:13.365 --> 00:18:14.685
That's what we're designed to do.

349
00:18:15.545 --> 00:18:19.765
So inescapably man will worship something in God's place.

350
00:18:21.025 --> 00:18:24.365
What's the, what's the Christian ease, the biblical word

351
00:18:24.955 --> 00:18:27.405
that we, that we know that to be

352
00:18:27.745 --> 00:18:30.165
and we worship something else other than God.

353
00:18:30.315 --> 00:18:32.565
Idol. Idol idolatry. Yeah.

354
00:18:33.525 --> 00:18:38.405
I would say that idolatry is ultimately that thread

355
00:18:38.635 --> 00:18:40.765
that weaves through all of sin.

356
00:18:42.595 --> 00:18:47.005
John Piper describes as any feeling or thought

357
00:18:48.225 --> 00:18:51.925
or speech or action that comes from a heart

358
00:18:52.475 --> 00:18:55.325
that does not treasure God over all things.

359
00:18:57.015 --> 00:18:58.285
Let's look at this in scripture

360
00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:00.325
and see how Paul plays this out a little bit.

361
00:19:00.435 --> 00:19:04.005
Will you turn with me to Romans one?

362
00:19:08.335 --> 00:19:10.925
We're gonna start in verse 18.

363
00:19:11.335 --> 00:19:14.605
We're gonna read Romans one 18 through 21.

364
00:19:16.505 --> 00:19:20.155
Does someone read that for us? Romans one 18 through 21,

365
00:19:27.815 --> 00:19:29.475
The WR of God revealed,

366
00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:32.275
condemn against the all ungodliness

367
00:19:32.295 --> 00:19:36.715
and un of them, provide their un the truth

368
00:19:37.815 --> 00:19:39.555
for what can be known about God.

369
00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:42.625
That's plain to them because God has shown it to them

370
00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:48.025
for his invisible attributes, mainly his eternal power.

371
00:19:48.165 --> 00:19:50.745
Divine nature have been clearly perceived

372
00:19:51.255 --> 00:19:53.025
ever since the creation of the world

373
00:19:53.565 --> 00:19:54.825
and the things that have been made.

374
00:19:55.365 --> 00:20:00.025
So they are without excuse for

375
00:20:00.225 --> 00:20:01.425
although they knew God.

376
00:20:01.815 --> 00:20:04.745
They did, they did not honor him as God

377
00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:06.505
or give thanks to him,

378
00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:09.345
but they became futile in their thinking

379
00:20:10.325 --> 00:20:12.065
and their foolish hearts were darkened.

380
00:20:14.655 --> 00:20:17.825
Yeah, this is a pretty powerful accusation

381
00:20:18.205 --> 00:20:21.585
and explanation that Paul makes of the human condition.

382
00:20:23.085 --> 00:20:24.545
It explains a lot of

383
00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:28.345
why we see the world the way that it is.

384
00:20:28.365 --> 00:20:31.705
But ultimately, what Paul explains here is that men,

385
00:20:32.015 --> 00:20:34.465
mankind at least suppress the truth.

386
00:20:35.455 --> 00:20:38.305
Because what can be known about God is plain to them.

387
00:20:38.365 --> 00:20:41.465
We talked about this, about those, uh, attributes of God,

388
00:20:41.575 --> 00:20:44.545
some of those being globally visible about God,

389
00:20:44.565 --> 00:20:47.405
but also his moral law is visible

390
00:20:47.945 --> 00:20:50.165
and experienced by us as humans.

391
00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:52.965
And he says that although they knew God,

392
00:20:52.965 --> 00:20:56.685
they did not glorify him as God or give thanks to him.

393
00:20:57.755 --> 00:21:00.255
So ultimately, when he's saying that there's this root

394
00:21:00.435 --> 00:21:02.455
of suppressing the truth about God

395
00:21:03.835 --> 00:21:07.215
and suppressing that desire to basically

396
00:21:07.235 --> 00:21:09.535
to avoid giving him glory things,

397
00:21:10.285 --> 00:21:13.935
that is what's going on in the human condition, is that we,

398
00:21:13.935 --> 00:21:17.575
even though we know the truth, or we knew about who God is

399
00:21:17.595 --> 00:21:20.895
and who were designed to worship, we suppress that truth.

400
00:21:21.395 --> 00:21:24.095
To avoid giving him glory

401
00:21:25.675 --> 00:21:30.265
going on in Romans one, will summon read 22 and 23

402
00:21:34.885 --> 00:21:39.505
To be wisest.

403
00:21:39.525 --> 00:21:40.525
God.

404
00:21:46.575 --> 00:21:49.105
Yeah. So remember that.

405
00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:51.025
If man's not going to glorify God,

406
00:21:52.005 --> 00:21:53.985
if man's not gonna worship God, we're going

407
00:21:53.985 --> 00:21:55.585
to worship something in his place.

408
00:21:55.605 --> 00:21:57.345
And what does Paul say here?

409
00:21:57.345 --> 00:22:00.945
That man, if they're not worshiping God turns to worship.

410
00:22:03.095 --> 00:22:05.095
Creation. Creation. Yeah.

411
00:22:05.995 --> 00:22:10.335
We worship things in the creatures instead of the creator.

412
00:22:10.475 --> 00:22:14.815
We worship things created instead of the origin, the creator

413
00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:16.215
of all things God.

414
00:22:17.275 --> 00:22:19.575
The result of that simple nature idol

415
00:22:19.835 --> 00:22:22.575
who plays itself out in many shapes and forms.

416
00:22:22.905 --> 00:22:25.175
We've seen that throughout the history of humanity.

417
00:22:26.515 --> 00:22:27.815
But all of those vice,

418
00:22:28.125 --> 00:22:31.535
whether it's the ancient Egyptians worshiping raw,

419
00:22:31.595 --> 00:22:35.055
the Sun God, or us worshiping ourselves

420
00:22:36.085 --> 00:22:38.015
through these devices that we use,

421
00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:44.295
they all boil down to the same basic fact that sin

422
00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:47.495
hates and suppresses the truth of God

423
00:22:48.395 --> 00:22:51.855
and it exchanges it for what sin loves and worships.

424
00:22:52.955 --> 00:22:54.095
Sin loves to worship

425
00:22:54.435 --> 00:22:57.655
and serve the creature, not the creator.

426
00:22:59.035 --> 00:23:01.575
So when we reject the truth that God is the one

427
00:23:01.635 --> 00:23:06.415
and only king who deserves our worship and our adoration,

428
00:23:07.795 --> 00:23:09.815
and when we live as worshipers designed

429
00:23:09.995 --> 00:23:12.455
to live in submission to his, to his lives.

430
00:23:12.595 --> 00:23:15.735
And perfect rule, when we live in that way, instead of

431
00:23:15.735 --> 00:23:19.655
how we're designed, we sin, we live in sin.

432
00:23:22.395 --> 00:23:26.055
So explain this corruption that we see to explain further

433
00:23:26.165 --> 00:23:29.015
what sin is, this corruption of God's perfect design.

434
00:23:29.395 --> 00:23:31.975
The biblical authors have used a myriad of different ways

435
00:23:32.155 --> 00:23:34.935
to, to show this, but they use, um,

436
00:23:36.265 --> 00:23:40.055
three terms very often to explain what sin is.

437
00:23:40.845 --> 00:23:43.055
They use language, um, like sin,

438
00:23:43.775 --> 00:23:45.295
iniquity, and transgression.

439
00:23:45.365 --> 00:23:46.445
If you look throughout scripture,

440
00:23:46.695 --> 00:23:48.885
those three words are used over and over

441
00:23:48.945 --> 00:23:51.725
and over again to explain this condition

442
00:23:51.725 --> 00:23:53.045
of sin that we've been talking about.

443
00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:56.205
So I want us to spend a little bit of time examining each

444
00:23:56.205 --> 00:23:59.165
of one of those words and how they're used in scripture

445
00:23:59.585 --> 00:24:02.805
and how it helps eliminate, um, a little bit better what,

446
00:24:03.075 --> 00:24:06.205
what we're talking about when we say the word saying.

447
00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:10.685
So the first one of those to illustrate this word.

448
00:24:11.865 --> 00:24:13.285
Um, let's do

449
00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.285
This.

450
00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:16.245
Who's to, who's to shoot a shot here?

451
00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:21.125
Mark, you start us up. Alright, all. Can you make this?

452
00:24:21.145 --> 00:24:24.085
If you, you make it. You read my illustration. Oh, okay.

453
00:24:25.025 --> 00:24:27.045
So Don't try No, try your best.

454
00:24:31.105 --> 00:24:33.205
That's Pretty good. What you got, man?

455
00:24:36.095 --> 00:24:38.245
Hello? Oh,

456
00:24:40.535 --> 00:24:41.925
Let's Start sweat, man.

457
00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:46.365
All right, one more. David, you guys.

458
00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:52.085
Okay. I would say all three

459
00:24:52.085 --> 00:24:53.405
of you guys are pretty good errands

460
00:24:55.215 --> 00:24:56.215
Close.

461
00:24:57.105 --> 00:25:01.685
But ultimately, while those were close, none

462
00:25:01.685 --> 00:25:03.325
of 'em actually hate.

463
00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:06.005
Right? What would we call that?

464
00:25:06.435 --> 00:25:09.125
Missing? The Mark. Missing the mark. Yeah.

465
00:25:09.125 --> 00:25:12.605
You've probably heard this, this term, this explanation.

466
00:25:13.665 --> 00:25:16.405
So that is the English word sent.

467
00:25:18.305 --> 00:25:21.045
The Hebrew word for that is qta,

468
00:25:21.865 --> 00:25:23.565
and the Greek word is Tia.

469
00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:26.165
But all three of those words,

470
00:25:26.165 --> 00:25:28.165
whether we use the English word sin

471
00:25:28.825 --> 00:25:31.605
or we use the Hebrew word as the biblical author said,

472
00:25:31.605 --> 00:25:33.165
or the Greek word hamartia.

473
00:25:34.285 --> 00:25:36.485
Ultimately what it means is to fail

474
00:25:37.105 --> 00:25:39.605
to miss the mark, to miss the goal.

475
00:25:41.385 --> 00:25:46.005
Um, that word, uh, is not always used in reference

476
00:25:46.025 --> 00:25:47.445
to like moral sin.

477
00:25:48.025 --> 00:25:52.445
In, in scripture in judges 2016, that saying word is used

478
00:25:52.465 --> 00:25:56.405
to describe how an expert with a, with a sling, um,

479
00:25:56.455 --> 00:25:57.605
could sling a stone

480
00:25:57.705 --> 00:26:01.725
and not, not miss the mark, not miss the bullseye.

481
00:26:02.675 --> 00:26:06.965
It's the same word that's used in Proverbs 19 two, uh,

482
00:26:07.075 --> 00:26:10.965
when the, uh, proverbs says that we, that people

483
00:26:10.965 --> 00:26:14.405
who act hastily while traveling are likely

484
00:26:14.625 --> 00:26:19.005
to Qatar are likely to miss their intended destination.

485
00:26:20.585 --> 00:26:23.445
So that brings us to the, the question then.

486
00:26:23.545 --> 00:26:25.685
So if sin is missing a goal

487
00:26:25.865 --> 00:26:29.325
or missing the mark, what is that goal?

488
00:26:29.425 --> 00:26:30.425
What's the goal?

489
00:26:34.815 --> 00:26:38.325
Perfection. Perfection. Yeah, that's good.

490
00:26:38.695 --> 00:26:39.765
Let's elaborate on that.

491
00:26:42.275 --> 00:26:45.405
Righteousness. Righteousness. Yeah.

492
00:26:45.905 --> 00:26:50.565
Ob Obedience. Be call. Yeah.

493
00:26:51.065 --> 00:26:53.045
Be light like Jesus. Yeah.

494
00:26:56.115 --> 00:27:00.325
Yeah. Pretty high standard, right?

495
00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:06.285
So even though Aaron hit the rim of the pitcher,

496
00:27:07.905 --> 00:27:11.205
it wasn't ultimately making the goal, right?

497
00:27:11.825 --> 00:27:13.365
It wasn't the actual thing.

498
00:27:18.625 --> 00:27:22.245
Sin doesn't mean that we are or to, to not miss the goal.

499
00:27:22.245 --> 00:27:23.365
Doesn't mean that we are God,

500
00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:26.805
but we are living according to his design.

501
00:27:27.465 --> 00:27:30.725
We exist according to his design.

502
00:27:32.565 --> 00:27:36.645
Ultimately, that plays itself out in how we love him

503
00:27:37.065 --> 00:27:38.205
and respond to him.

504
00:27:38.665 --> 00:27:41.605
How we love one another perfectly.

505
00:27:42.385 --> 00:27:44.885
That's what God's design for humanity was.

506
00:27:46.905 --> 00:27:48.165
So let's look at the second word.

507
00:27:48.305 --> 00:27:51.085
So we've looked at the most common one. Sin.

508
00:27:51.825 --> 00:27:54.085
The second word that's used often in scripture is

509
00:27:54.085 --> 00:27:55.205
this word in Nick way.

510
00:27:56.025 --> 00:27:57.365
And if you're like me,

511
00:27:57.365 --> 00:28:00.525
you probably never use the word iniquity just in like

512
00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:01.965
everyday language, right?

513
00:28:03.655 --> 00:28:05.635
So what does this word iniquity mean?

514
00:28:05.695 --> 00:28:10.435
So English word iniquity, the Hebrew word would be Avon Vo

515
00:28:11.335 --> 00:28:12.635
not Hebrew.

516
00:28:12.635 --> 00:28:13.635
Speaker.

517
00:28:15.265 --> 00:28:16.715
Make. Huh?

518
00:28:17.615 --> 00:28:18.035
Makeup.

519
00:28:19.975 --> 00:28:22.715
Makeup, no.

520
00:28:22.715 --> 00:28:24.715
But now that I know the Hebrew meaning of this word,

521
00:28:24.715 --> 00:28:26.475
that seems kind of funny.

522
00:28:27.615 --> 00:28:29.515
So ultimately what this word means,

523
00:28:29.855 --> 00:28:32.675
and the verb tense would be to aah,

524
00:28:34.455 --> 00:28:36.675
but it implies

525
00:28:38.865 --> 00:28:43.075
something that was straight, but is now bent.

526
00:28:44.345 --> 00:28:49.035
Another way we could say would be bent or crooked,

527
00:28:52.065 --> 00:28:53.285
or even it,

528
00:28:59.325 --> 00:29:01.445
I didn't make it home before I came over here tonight,

529
00:29:01.445 --> 00:29:03.165
but the illustration I wanted to show

530
00:29:03.165 --> 00:29:05.485
for this would be if you were to take a,

531
00:29:05.575 --> 00:29:07.965
let's say a paper towel tube, right?

532
00:29:08.545 --> 00:29:10.565
And you were to shine a light through that tube,

533
00:29:11.585 --> 00:29:13.445
you would be able to see the light on the other side.

534
00:29:13.705 --> 00:29:17.005
But as soon as you bend that tube, you shine the light

535
00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:19.365
through that there would be no visible light

536
00:29:19.865 --> 00:29:21.005
in even from this side.

537
00:29:21.245 --> 00:29:23.405
'cause now that pad is bent, it's crippled.

538
00:29:28.385 --> 00:29:31.965
So something that is used to describe that as bent, crooked,

539
00:29:32.025 --> 00:29:34.005
or twisted as an enc crooked road.

540
00:29:35.505 --> 00:29:39.005
The scriptures also use this word to describe a back

541
00:29:39.155 --> 00:29:41.965
that is bent out of shape in a physical sense.

542
00:29:43.025 --> 00:29:46.325
But it implies a distorting of what, uh, what was

543
00:29:46.325 --> 00:29:48.445
otherwise beautiful or good.

544
00:29:49.785 --> 00:29:52.245
And it's something that is twisting, that something

545
00:29:52.245 --> 00:29:53.485
that was good or beautiful

546
00:29:53.485 --> 00:29:55.725
and is something that is ugly and evil.

547
00:29:55.835 --> 00:29:58.005
Instead of being fruitful

548
00:29:58.005 --> 00:30:02.285
and multiplying, we see murder and death.

549
00:30:03.675 --> 00:30:08.565
Instead of caring for the poor, we see instead envy

550
00:30:08.705 --> 00:30:11.885
and stealing from our neighbor instead

551
00:30:11.885 --> 00:30:13.285
of submitting to one another.

552
00:30:13.385 --> 00:30:16.765
And love, we see things like lust

553
00:30:18.425 --> 00:30:21.005
and using others for our own pleasure.

554
00:30:23.505 --> 00:30:26.965
The word is also used to refer not just to the action,

555
00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:30.645
the crooked or bent actions, but also the crooked

556
00:30:30.645 --> 00:30:34.045
and bent results of our actions of our sin.

557
00:30:35.195 --> 00:30:37.005
It's used iniquity is used

558
00:30:37.005 --> 00:30:39.285
to describe things like suffering people.

559
00:30:40.315 --> 00:30:43.125
It's used to describe shattered relationships.

560
00:30:43.995 --> 00:30:48.565
It's used to describe, uh, violence amongst nations.

561
00:30:50.225 --> 00:30:51.805
So when we hear the biblical phrase

562
00:30:52.025 --> 00:30:56.645
to bear your iniquity, this is what that is.

563
00:30:58.115 --> 00:31:00.685
That term often is foreign to us.

564
00:31:00.795 --> 00:31:02.805
What does it mean to bear your iniquity?

565
00:31:03.345 --> 00:31:07.365
It means burying God allows mankind to carry the weight

566
00:31:07.505 --> 00:31:10.565
of their own crooked vent and twisted choices.

567
00:31:12.025 --> 00:31:14.605
That's what that means to bear your nuclear.

568
00:31:15.545 --> 00:31:19.965
So when you think about understanding sin as the twisting

569
00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:24.605
or the bending of what God intended to be straight, How does

570
00:31:24.605 --> 00:31:25.805
that help you to see

571
00:31:25.865 --> 00:31:28.005
and understand the consequences of sin more clearly?

572
00:31:29.025 --> 00:31:29.595
What do you think?

573
00:31:42.135 --> 00:31:46.075
How does understanding sin as bending

574
00:31:46.075 --> 00:31:49.915
or twisting God's intended design or humanity

575
00:31:50.015 --> 00:31:53.475
and creation allow you to understand its consequences?

576
00:31:55.015 --> 00:31:58.955
Its results. It's pretty easy to look at the world

577
00:31:59.095 --> 00:31:59.955
and see the,

578
00:32:09.055 --> 00:32:13.755
so those price makes are pass straight and then for that.

579
00:32:13.895 --> 00:32:17.275
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's good.

580
00:32:17.985 --> 00:32:21.715
Well, if you gave me example of a paper towel mm-hmm.

581
00:32:21.795 --> 00:32:23.395
Think you had a gun that's bent,

582
00:32:24.175 --> 00:32:25.915
it might either blow up on you, right?

583
00:32:26.105 --> 00:32:28.555
Yeah. Or it's at loose in shoot my shoot

584
00:32:28.555 --> 00:32:29.555
Skirt. Yeah. Not shoot

585
00:32:29.555 --> 00:32:30.275
street. Yeah.

586
00:32:30.545 --> 00:32:33.675
Even slightly, slightly off. True. Right

587
00:32:34.185 --> 00:32:35.275
Down down range.

588
00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:38.755
Yeah. It kind of comes back to the illustration that

589
00:32:39.275 --> 00:32:40.805
John was using with the plumb line,

590
00:32:40.805 --> 00:32:42.885
right in our, in our sermon series.

591
00:32:43.035 --> 00:32:47.005
That anything that's just slightly Ben, slightly off

592
00:32:47.715 --> 00:32:51.885
from true north is gonna lead to horrible results one way

593
00:32:51.885 --> 00:32:53.485
or the other way off from Right.

594
00:32:54.025 --> 00:32:57.605
That's good. So we've looked at these words,

595
00:32:58.115 --> 00:33:00.485
said we've looked at iniquity.

596
00:33:04.345 --> 00:33:05.565
The last word that we'll look at

597
00:33:05.565 --> 00:33:08.965
that the biblical authors use to describe

598
00:33:09.555 --> 00:33:12.005
what we're talking about tonight is the word transgression.

599
00:33:13.025 --> 00:33:16.245
So the Hebrew word that they use is pecha,

600
00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:18.565
and the Greek word is Pima.

601
00:33:19.385 --> 00:33:22.725
So pecha refers to the ways

602
00:33:22.755 --> 00:33:25.445
that people violate the trust of others

603
00:33:25.945 --> 00:33:27.965
as in the betrayal of a relationship.

604
00:33:29.145 --> 00:33:31.405
So this plays out in multiple kinds

605
00:33:31.405 --> 00:33:33.165
of relationships throughout scripture.

606
00:33:33.785 --> 00:33:37.045
Um, it can be between persons, it could be between nations.

607
00:33:38.095 --> 00:33:41.275
And if two nations are in a treaty with one another

608
00:33:42.295 --> 00:33:43.755
and one nation breaks,

609
00:33:43.945 --> 00:33:46.875
that treaty violates the terms of that treaty.

610
00:33:47.465 --> 00:33:51.875
That nation would be said to, uh, paal with the other,

611
00:33:52.295 --> 00:33:55.155
to break trust with the other party.

612
00:33:55.575 --> 00:33:56.955
That's the word that it's used.

613
00:33:57.025 --> 00:33:58.715
Transgression is that same word.

614
00:33:59.735 --> 00:34:01.675
So this transgression

615
00:34:01.775 --> 00:34:05.755
or breaking of relational trust can happen between humans.

616
00:34:06.375 --> 00:34:07.955
We can peal with one another

617
00:34:08.255 --> 00:34:09.595
and break trust with one another.

618
00:34:11.375 --> 00:34:14.315
And we can also peal with God, break trust

619
00:34:14.345 --> 00:34:16.315
between God and man.

620
00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:19.675
Some ways that we see this played out in scripture is in

621
00:34:19.805 --> 00:34:22.875
Hosea, the prophet accuses the Israelites

622
00:34:22.875 --> 00:34:27.035
of Pesa transgression because of their worship of other gods

623
00:34:27.035 --> 00:34:30.115
and violating the trust between Israel and Yahweh.

624
00:34:30.115 --> 00:34:34.435
As that, that's transgression and another prophet.

625
00:34:34.575 --> 00:34:38.155
In Amos, we see the prophet associates transgression

626
00:34:38.155 --> 00:34:41.555
with its choice to mistreat or ignore the poor

627
00:34:41.735 --> 00:34:45.995
and the vulnerable community, which is ultimately a betrayal

628
00:34:47.975 --> 00:34:50.075
of breaking of trust of humanity

629
00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:52.715
and honoring humans made in God's image.

630
00:34:54.975 --> 00:34:57.235
So how does transgression

631
00:34:58.705 --> 00:35:01.155
with our neighbor ultimately equate

632
00:35:01.375 --> 00:35:03.475
to transgression with God?

633
00:35:03.615 --> 00:35:07.515
How does betraying trust with our neighbor ultimately

634
00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:10.715
equates to breaking trust with God?

635
00:35:11.665 --> 00:35:14.075
Well, it doesn't it break the second

636
00:35:14.185 --> 00:35:15.515
commander. Love your neighbor.

637
00:35:15.945 --> 00:35:19.635
Love your neighbor. Yeah. Yeah. Oh God.

638
00:35:19.825 --> 00:35:23.475
Love your neighbor. I'm gonna ask this in a

639
00:35:23.535 --> 00:35:26.555
and uh, maybe frame this question with a story.

640
00:35:26.555 --> 00:35:28.115
Right? So just recently,

641
00:35:28.195 --> 00:35:31.755
a couple weeks ago in the sermon series, we looked at, um,

642
00:35:32.165 --> 00:35:36.235
David sin, uh, against, uh, Uriah ahead type,

643
00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:42.205
where he took Bathsheba, Uriah's wife slept with,

644
00:35:42.495 --> 00:35:43.565
slept with Bashiva,

645
00:35:43.945 --> 00:35:47.405
and then went to have Uriah, his friend killed.

646
00:35:47.815 --> 00:35:51.765
Right? And when David is confessing that sin

647
00:35:51.765 --> 00:35:55.325
before God, he says this, this phrase

648
00:35:55.345 --> 00:35:58.645
to God in Psalm 51 says, I'm against you

649
00:35:58.745 --> 00:36:00.405
and you only have I sinned.

650
00:36:00.905 --> 00:36:03.965
But if you've just read that story, you're like, man, no,

651
00:36:03.965 --> 00:36:05.565
David, you s sin against your right.

652
00:36:05.665 --> 00:36:07.005
You sin against dash shiva.

653
00:36:07.825 --> 00:36:10.605
But how David views it is those sins.

654
00:36:10.605 --> 00:36:15.405
While yes, transgressions with Uriah, breaking trust

655
00:36:15.405 --> 00:36:19.365
with Uriah, breaking trust with Ashima, he ultimately views

656
00:36:19.365 --> 00:36:23.485
that as breaking trust with God, sinning against God.

657
00:36:24.065 --> 00:36:26.765
So coming back to that question, how does that transgression

658
00:36:27.795 --> 00:36:30.165
with our neighbor, breaking trust with our neighbor,

659
00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:33.085
ultimately if waits up, breaking trust with God?

660
00:36:34.365 --> 00:36:35.965
I think kind of how you saying earlier

661
00:36:35.965 --> 00:36:38.605
that God is the creator and you just hurt

662
00:36:38.705 --> 00:36:41.125
or, you know, destroyed something that he created.

663
00:36:42.005 --> 00:36:43.525
I guess he tells us to love one another,

664
00:36:43.625 --> 00:36:45.765
but it's also created all of us equally.

665
00:36:46.185 --> 00:36:47.445
So, especially if you hurt someone

666
00:36:47.745 --> 00:36:50.365
that's literally like taking someone's favorite item

667
00:36:50.395 --> 00:36:51.805
that they work so hard to make

668
00:36:51.825 --> 00:36:53.645
and just inspected it on the ground. Mm-hmm.

669
00:36:53.865 --> 00:36:54.085
So

670
00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:04.685
how else it's a disregard of that person,

671
00:37:06.115 --> 00:37:07.645
whether it's the neighbor

672
00:37:08.345 --> 00:37:11.685
or ultimately it's of God.

673
00:37:12.185 --> 00:37:14.605
Mm-hmm. Because of all that she just said.

674
00:37:21.325 --> 00:37:22.325
Thoughts on that

675
00:37:25.385 --> 00:37:26.385
Two? I think it's, uh, first

676
00:37:26.385 --> 00:37:28.565
John, he says, uh,

677
00:37:29.145 --> 00:37:31.925
how can you say you love, uh, God?

678
00:37:31.945 --> 00:37:36.045
And you can't see in the nature neighbor, you can't see.

679
00:37:37.105 --> 00:37:40.805
So I think there's a correlation between it's easy to say,

680
00:37:40.805 --> 00:37:43.205
well, I love God theoretically.

681
00:37:43.395 --> 00:37:44.685
Yeah. But it's harder

682
00:37:44.705 --> 00:37:47.965
to say I love a real concrete in your face.

683
00:37:49.115 --> 00:37:51.605
It's sort of like, uh, we talked talking about the sin

684
00:37:51.605 --> 00:37:53.605
of murder and the image of God.

685
00:37:54.545 --> 00:37:57.205
Uh, God states that it's wrong

686
00:37:57.205 --> 00:37:59.525
because man's amazing God's image.

687
00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:01.565
So in some ways, I think similar in

688
00:38:01.565 --> 00:38:03.125
transgressing the image of God.

689
00:38:03.555 --> 00:38:04.555
Yeah,

690
00:38:05.075 --> 00:38:06.405
Yeah, Yeah.

691
00:38:06.405 --> 00:38:08.205
Similar language to what Jesus says too.

692
00:38:08.305 --> 00:38:12.645
How he commands us is basically that whole, um,

693
00:38:14.265 --> 00:38:16.725
saying of whenever you did this to the least

694
00:38:16.725 --> 00:38:17.925
of these, you did it to me.

695
00:38:17.975 --> 00:38:20.245
Right? Whenever you took care of the poor, clothed,

696
00:38:20.545 --> 00:38:24.765
the naked, um, bound up the broken heart and the hurting,

697
00:38:25.525 --> 00:38:26.645
whenever you did the least of those,

698
00:38:26.755 --> 00:38:29.765
it's like you were doing it to me, God identifies

699
00:38:30.555 --> 00:38:32.845
with his image bearers in that way.

700
00:38:33.025 --> 00:38:34.805
So if we sin against one another

701
00:38:35.795 --> 00:38:37.645
with sin against his image bearers

702
00:38:37.665 --> 00:38:40.605
and transgress against others, God views that

703
00:38:40.705 --> 00:38:42.405
as if you're doing it to him.

704
00:38:44.385 --> 00:38:47.845
It elevates definitely the weight of our sin,

705
00:38:48.145 --> 00:38:50.525
and especially sin in our relationships with one another.

706
00:38:51.515 --> 00:38:53.205
It's not just hurting one another.

707
00:38:53.905 --> 00:38:55.765
You're hurting that relationship with God

708
00:38:55.905 --> 00:38:57.125
by hurting one another.

709
00:39:01.385 --> 00:39:03.605
So hopefully these three sins

710
00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:05.965
and understanding those a little bit further,

711
00:39:05.965 --> 00:39:10.405
missing the mark, that it's bent and twisted and crooked,

712
00:39:11.065 --> 00:39:15.765
and that it's breaking trust, those words to describe sin,

713
00:39:15.765 --> 00:39:19.045
helps to fill out your understanding of what sin looks like.

714
00:39:20.425 --> 00:39:23.485
So the next question that we have in, are all of us affected

715
00:39:23.705 --> 00:39:26.125
by sin or all humans affected by sin?

716
00:39:26.245 --> 00:39:29.365
I think we all will not to that,

717
00:39:29.425 --> 00:39:31.125
but let's look at that, what that looks like.

718
00:39:31.125 --> 00:39:33.565
There would be, uh, Romans five.

719
00:39:34.535 --> 00:39:36.205
We're going to flip over there we

720
00:39:36.205 --> 00:39:37.405
were, we were in Romans one.

721
00:39:37.405 --> 00:39:39.125
So if you're still there, flip over a couple pages.

722
00:39:39.265 --> 00:39:42.845
Romans five, we're gonna look at verses 12 to 14.

723
00:39:43.795 --> 00:39:45.805
This is where our verse for the night comes from.

724
00:39:47.995 --> 00:39:49.045
Paul writes here that

725
00:39:49.045 --> 00:39:53.085
therefore just as sin came into the world through one man

726
00:39:53.905 --> 00:39:58.245
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men,

727
00:39:58.245 --> 00:40:02.805
because all sin for sin indeed was in the world

728
00:40:02.905 --> 00:40:04.765
before the law was given.

729
00:40:04.825 --> 00:40:09.255
But sin is not counted. Whether is no law, stay with me.

730
00:40:09.295 --> 00:40:10.455
I know this can get confusing.

731
00:40:11.235 --> 00:40:13.295
Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses,

732
00:40:14.325 --> 00:40:17.535
even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression

733
00:40:17.535 --> 00:40:20.895
of Adam, who was a type of the one to come.

734
00:40:20.915 --> 00:40:23.215
So I, I understand this can be a bit difficult

735
00:40:23.215 --> 00:40:27.295
to read both in the odd language that Paul is using,

736
00:40:27.395 --> 00:40:30.575
and also it can be difficult to read in his content.

737
00:40:31.405 --> 00:40:35.545
Paul's saying some pretty, um, radical things here.

738
00:40:36.015 --> 00:40:39.465
He's saying, read that again, that death,

739
00:40:40.395 --> 00:40:43.665
death spread to all men because all sin.

740
00:40:43.805 --> 00:40:46.945
And he says that in relationship to talking about Adam's

741
00:40:47.665 --> 00:40:48.665
specific sin.

742
00:40:49.645 --> 00:40:53.745
So basically he's saying, because Adam sinned, all sinned.

743
00:40:55.245 --> 00:40:57.345
And it's not, what it's not saying is that

744
00:40:57.345 --> 00:40:59.625
because Adam sinned, all will sin.

745
00:41:00.075 --> 00:41:04.225
While that is true, he's saying when Adam sinned

746
00:41:04.335 --> 00:41:08.505
that one sin, it's as if we all sin, all

747
00:41:08.505 --> 00:41:10.945
of humanity sin with Adam.

748
00:41:12.295 --> 00:41:15.825
Essentially what Paul is explaining here is what we've come

749
00:41:15.825 --> 00:41:19.305
to know as the doctrine of imputed or inherited sin.

750
00:41:20.605 --> 00:41:22.225
So we're gonna look at this in two ways.

751
00:41:22.265 --> 00:41:24.505
We're gonna talk about inherited guilt

752
00:41:25.165 --> 00:41:26.585
and inherited corruption.

753
00:41:27.765 --> 00:41:32.385
So inherited guilt is the, is the idea the fact

754
00:41:32.385 --> 00:41:36.485
that we are all counted guilty because of Adam's sin.

755
00:41:36.545 --> 00:41:39.805
So this idea that all men's sin means that God

756
00:41:40.845 --> 00:41:45.085
considers all of us, all of us as humanity as having sinned.

757
00:41:45.435 --> 00:41:50.125
When Adam disobeyed a little further on in

758
00:41:50.125 --> 00:41:51.565
verses 18 and 19,

759
00:41:52.225 --> 00:41:54.285
you see Paul elaborate on this a little bit more.

760
00:41:54.425 --> 00:41:57.005
He says that by one man's disobedience,

761
00:41:57.595 --> 00:42:01.445
many were made sinners because of one man's disobedience.

762
00:42:02.155 --> 00:42:04.125
Many were made sinners.

763
00:42:04.945 --> 00:42:08.605
So when Adam's sin, God basically considers all

764
00:42:09.025 --> 00:42:12.685
who would descend from Adam as also being sinners.

765
00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:16.005
So that is inherited guilt.

766
00:42:16.055 --> 00:42:17.085
We'll talk about that in just

767
00:42:17.325 --> 00:42:18.365
a little bit more in just a second.

768
00:42:18.745 --> 00:42:21.125
But also wants to look at what inherited corruption.

769
00:42:21.145 --> 00:42:25.245
So if we're taking inherited sin as one broad ca category,

770
00:42:25.245 --> 00:42:28.525
we're looking at how that plays out as guilt and corruption.

771
00:42:29.145 --> 00:42:32.405
So inherited corruption, say that we have a sinful nature

772
00:42:32.915 --> 00:42:34.405
because of Adam's sin.

773
00:42:34.995 --> 00:42:38.045
Sometimes you might hear this referred to as original sin.

774
00:42:38.705 --> 00:42:40.565
Uh, it's basically the same idea.

775
00:42:40.865 --> 00:42:44.485
It speaks to the fact that all humans are inherently born

776
00:42:44.485 --> 00:42:48.365
with a fallen nature with sinful tendencies,

777
00:42:49.035 --> 00:42:52.525
desires, and dispositions bent on rebelling against God

778
00:42:53.065 --> 00:42:54.165
and his good order.

779
00:42:54.795 --> 00:42:57.805
Essentially, it's why the world has a sin problem,

780
00:42:57.805 --> 00:43:01.725
because we have in us this corrupt nature bent towards

781
00:43:02.545 --> 00:43:05.205
sin rather than being bent towards righteousness.

782
00:43:06.655 --> 00:43:11.405
Psalm 51, verse five, David describes this in himself

783
00:43:11.465 --> 00:43:14.285
as God is revealing it to him, saying, behold,

784
00:43:14.765 --> 00:43:17.045
I was brought forth in inequity.

785
00:43:17.235 --> 00:43:20.085
That same word for being bent, twisted, corrupt.

786
00:43:20.105 --> 00:43:23.765
He says, I was brought forth in inequity and in sin.

787
00:43:23.825 --> 00:43:26.565
My mother concede me, essentially saying,

788
00:43:26.955 --> 00:43:28.565
from the time I was born,

789
00:43:29.745 --> 00:43:33.045
before I was even born, I was already bent,

790
00:43:33.195 --> 00:43:34.365
twisted, and corrupted.

791
00:43:34.485 --> 00:43:36.245
I didn't become twisted

792
00:43:36.245 --> 00:43:40.045
and corrupted as I sinned to saying, as when I was born,

793
00:43:40.365 --> 00:43:42.885
I was already sinful and twisted.

794
00:43:44.065 --> 00:43:46.805
And what he's ultimately doing is describing that himself,

795
00:43:46.825 --> 00:43:48.125
but also describing that

796
00:43:48.225 --> 00:43:52.045
as the human condition in our natures.

797
00:43:52.665 --> 00:43:55.445
We totally lack spiritual good before our God

798
00:43:56.505 --> 00:44:00.005
and in our actions we are totally unable to do

799
00:44:00.565 --> 00:44:02.045
spiritual good before God.

800
00:44:02.195 --> 00:44:06.125
Even at our best efforts, we are unable incapable

801
00:44:06.705 --> 00:44:10.325
of being good before God because of our corruption.

802
00:44:13.905 --> 00:44:16.045
So this is a pretty difficult reality for us

803
00:44:16.045 --> 00:44:17.125
to come to terms with, right?

804
00:44:18.785 --> 00:44:22.045
And it's hard for us to accept, even in biblical circles.

805
00:44:22.045 --> 00:44:23.685
It's hard for us to accept this,

806
00:44:23.735 --> 00:44:27.205
especially if we've grown up in western American culture

807
00:44:27.335 --> 00:44:29.725
where we tend to be very individualistic.

808
00:44:31.305 --> 00:44:35.365
We like to think that our future positions are determined by

809
00:44:35.365 --> 00:44:36.365
what we do, right?

810
00:44:37.115 --> 00:44:40.085
It's that idea of like, I don't care what I was born into.

811
00:44:40.405 --> 00:44:41.765
I can make a name for myself.

812
00:44:41.965 --> 00:44:43.805
I can make a living for myself, whatever.

813
00:44:43.835 --> 00:44:44.925
It's a name for myself.

814
00:44:46.985 --> 00:44:50.005
And so we, we kind of want to reject this

815
00:44:50.465 --> 00:44:53.045
and it, it hurts a little bit to accept,

816
00:44:54.785 --> 00:44:57.285
but in a moment I'll, we'll talk about why that idea

817
00:44:57.345 --> 00:45:00.405
of being so ruggedly individualistic is actually not a very

818
00:45:00.405 --> 00:45:01.725
good thing for us.

819
00:45:03.345 --> 00:45:04.765
And it might seem unfair,

820
00:45:04.865 --> 00:45:07.605
but really this idea of imputation isn't

821
00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:09.125
as foreign as we think.

822
00:45:09.235 --> 00:45:10.325
I'll give you an example of this

823
00:45:10.325 --> 00:45:13.245
that maybe we can all can somewhat relate to.

824
00:45:13.975 --> 00:45:18.235
Um, does anyone hear a football fan?

825
00:45:18.555 --> 00:45:23.035
American football family? I am Jacob is we're going to,

826
00:45:24.705 --> 00:45:28.915
yeah, I know you guys all have fantasy football teams

827
00:45:29.015 --> 00:45:30.195
on your phones right now.

828
00:45:32.305 --> 00:45:34.395
Okay? So consider, what is it called?

829
00:45:35.215 --> 00:45:38.635
If the offense is lined up, ready to run play,

830
00:45:39.495 --> 00:45:41.835
the quarterback is behind series calling cadence.

831
00:45:43.455 --> 00:45:45.715
And that slot receiver over here

832
00:45:46.525 --> 00:45:48.515
jumps off the line. What do we call that?

833
00:45:48.965 --> 00:45:51.035
False start. False start. False start, right?

834
00:45:51.035 --> 00:45:54.835
False start. Every, all other 10 players,

835
00:45:55.135 --> 00:45:56.435
11 players on the field.

836
00:45:57.375 --> 00:45:59.555
The other 10 did not move,

837
00:45:59.775 --> 00:46:04.515
but yet one over here, one receiver moves.

838
00:46:05.585 --> 00:46:06.675
What does the referee do?

839
00:46:07.555 --> 00:46:08.715
Penalize the whole team

840
00:46:08.935 --> 00:46:10.435
Throws, throws the flag, right?

841
00:46:10.545 --> 00:46:14.155
It's on the field. All starts call, does just

842
00:46:14.155 --> 00:46:16.955
that one receiver have to move back five yards?

843
00:46:19.055 --> 00:46:23.195
No, the entire team moves back, right? Change

844
00:46:23.195 --> 00:46:26.155
That Because of one man's mistake.

845
00:46:27.405 --> 00:46:30.065
All 11 have to move back with him.

846
00:46:31.525 --> 00:46:33.305
So this is a very simple example,

847
00:46:34.245 --> 00:46:37.905
but I'm, I'm using it to draw out the idea that this idea of

848
00:46:38.415 --> 00:46:41.505
imputed consequences, imputed sin, is really not as,

849
00:46:41.645 --> 00:46:43.145
as formed as we might think.

850
00:46:43.685 --> 00:46:45.545
We don't, we have no problem accepting

851
00:46:45.545 --> 00:46:47.265
that when it comes to football, right?

852
00:46:49.125 --> 00:46:52.265
And it's the same idea by one man's sin, Adam.

853
00:46:53.845 --> 00:46:56.625
All of humanity is counted as being on Adam's team.

854
00:46:57.325 --> 00:47:01.705
And we all accept the penalty to the weight of that sin.

855
00:47:06.245 --> 00:47:08.745
Now that's heavy. It's hard to reconcile with.

856
00:47:09.725 --> 00:47:13.625
But there's also good news when it comes to imputation,

857
00:47:14.615 --> 00:47:15.745
imputed consequences.

858
00:47:17.415 --> 00:47:20.265
Because while it can be difficult when it comes to sin,

859
00:47:21.295 --> 00:47:22.945
this reality, this existence

860
00:47:22.945 --> 00:47:25.865
of the mutation brings overwhelming blessing when

861
00:47:25.865 --> 00:47:26.905
Jesus applies it.

862
00:47:28.605 --> 00:47:31.605
So read the rest of Romans five 15 through 19.

863
00:47:31.625 --> 00:47:35.845
Is someone still there? Let's look at the rest of that.

864
00:47:35.845 --> 00:47:38.085
Does someone read verses 15 through 19?

865
00:47:38.825 --> 00:47:42.725
If the free gift does not like the T for as many died

866
00:47:42.785 --> 00:47:46.205
to one man's trespass much more because grace of God

867
00:47:46.505 --> 00:47:49.805
and the free gift by the grace of that one man, Jesus

868
00:47:50.945 --> 00:47:52.365
Christ, abounded from amen.

869
00:47:53.665 --> 00:47:55.525
And the free gift does not like the result

870
00:47:55.525 --> 00:47:56.565
of the one man's sin

871
00:47:57.465 --> 00:48:00.805
for the judgment following one trespass, but condemnation.

872
00:48:01.585 --> 00:48:04.725
But the free gift following many trespasses

873
00:48:05.675 --> 00:48:07.045
brought justification.

874
00:48:08.665 --> 00:48:12.165
Or because one man's trespass death brain from that one man,

875
00:48:12.755 --> 00:48:15.765
much more for those who receive the abundance of grace

876
00:48:16.545 --> 00:48:18.885
in the pre righteousness brain in the life,

877
00:48:19.105 --> 00:48:20.325
the one man Jesus Christ.

878
00:48:25.465 --> 00:48:28.045
We could read that 10 times over and over again

879
00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:30.125
and just worship Jesus more

880
00:48:30.125 --> 00:48:31.685
and more each time we read it, right?

881
00:48:32.995 --> 00:48:35.965
Because what he's saying there, remember we talked about how

882
00:48:36.545 --> 00:48:38.645
our individualistic mindset isn't so good?

883
00:48:40.355 --> 00:48:43.805
Well think about everything we talked about so far. So far.

884
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:46.805
How many of us have missed the mark?

885
00:48:47.545 --> 00:48:51.485
How many of us have lived out some sort of broken

886
00:48:51.665 --> 00:48:52.885
or twisted behavior?

887
00:48:53.985 --> 00:48:55.885
How many of us have committed transgression

888
00:48:55.885 --> 00:48:56.965
against our neighbors?

889
00:48:57.625 --> 00:48:59.645
If we really want individual results

890
00:48:59.785 --> 00:49:03.165
for our individual actions, we're all hopeless, right?

891
00:49:03.255 --> 00:49:05.485
We're all completely guilty.

892
00:49:05.665 --> 00:49:08.925
But the good news of invitation here is

893
00:49:08.925 --> 00:49:13.325
that our eternal position of righteousness, it's not up

894
00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:16.965
to us to earn, we're not capable of earning it,

895
00:49:17.505 --> 00:49:21.765
but it's imputed to us in Christ Jesus, the new Adam.

896
00:49:23.145 --> 00:49:25.845
So all, even though through the first Adam,

897
00:49:26.145 --> 00:49:30.565
we all inherit sin, what's being offered to us

898
00:49:30.595 --> 00:49:34.885
through Jesus is eternal, um,

899
00:49:35.065 --> 00:49:39.165
sanctification, eternal glory, eternal redemption through

900
00:49:39.405 --> 00:49:40.685
that man's righteousness.

901
00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:44.205
Isaiah 53 6 reminds us

902
00:49:44.205 --> 00:49:46.485
that all we like sheep have gone astray.

903
00:49:47.065 --> 00:49:49.725
We have turned every one of us to his own way.

904
00:49:50.865 --> 00:49:55.805
And the Lord Yahweh has laid on him Jesus, the iniquity,

905
00:49:56.355 --> 00:50:00.245
that same word of us all that corrupted,

906
00:50:00.515 --> 00:50:02.445
twisted result of our sins.

907
00:50:02.865 --> 00:50:05.485
He has laid it on Jesus on our behalf.

908
00:50:06.585 --> 00:50:09.205
So while you might wrestle with why

909
00:50:09.915 --> 00:50:14.565
imputed sin is difficult, um, also understand

910
00:50:14.785 --> 00:50:17.485
and remember that imputed righteousness

911
00:50:18.625 --> 00:50:21.805
is far more glorious than the sin.

912
00:50:23.785 --> 00:50:26.485
So we're gonna move forward here to our last section here

913
00:50:26.485 --> 00:50:28.490
before we, we get into a little bit of discussion

914
00:50:29.665 --> 00:50:33.045
and we're gonna look at the punishment, the results of sin.

915
00:50:35.025 --> 00:50:39.205
So first question I'll ask is, does there have

916
00:50:39.205 --> 00:50:40.725
to be a punishment for sin?

917
00:50:40.825 --> 00:50:43.605
Yes. 'cause God is holding Yes. 'cause God is holding.

918
00:50:49.145 --> 00:50:53.325
But why God's holy? Why must there be a punishment for sin?

919
00:50:54.095 --> 00:50:55.365
Can't be the presence of sin.

920
00:50:56.135 --> 00:50:57.485
Can't be in the presence of sin.

921
00:51:05.515 --> 00:51:06.965
He's Infinitely wholly.

922
00:51:07.105 --> 00:51:10.925
So the punishment must be infinite

923
00:51:12.705 --> 00:51:14.205
to correspond with the infinite

924
00:51:15.355 --> 00:51:16.355
Outrage. Yeah.

925
00:51:16.355 --> 00:51:20.565
Gut his gut, his also gut his adjust

926
00:51:20.825 --> 00:51:22.925
so he can just wash it away.

927
00:51:23.195 --> 00:51:26.885
Just forgive God, affect just,

928
00:51:27.795 --> 00:51:28.795
Yeah. Yeah.

929
00:51:28.795 --> 00:51:30.045
It has to be just

930
00:51:30.475 --> 00:51:31.475
Time. He

931
00:51:31.475 --> 00:51:32.725
can be gracious and loving,

932
00:51:32.785 --> 00:51:35.885
but he also is just, yeah, at the short of it,

933
00:51:35.975 --> 00:51:39.165
God's righteousness demands it so that he can be glorified

934
00:51:39.945 --> 00:51:41.445
in the university University's created.

935
00:51:42.865 --> 00:51:44.525
So we're gonna look at the punishment.

936
00:51:44.655 --> 00:51:46.525
We're gonna go through this a little, little quickly,

937
00:51:47.625 --> 00:51:50.965
but we're gonna break down the punishment for sin, uh,

938
00:51:51.065 --> 00:51:54.405
in five ways, five categories for how this breaks down.

939
00:51:55.945 --> 00:51:58.765
But as we look at these, uh, we're not gonna just look at

940
00:51:58.765 --> 00:52:00.765
what the punishment is, but we're also gonna look at

941
00:52:00.765 --> 00:52:03.685
how Jesus endures this punishment for us.

942
00:52:05.025 --> 00:52:07.445
So the first punishment that we see for sin is

943
00:52:07.445 --> 00:52:10.405
that there's going to be suffering and hardship in life.

944
00:52:11.105 --> 00:52:13.565
So going back to the curse in Genesis three,

945
00:52:13.575 --> 00:52:18.525
after Adam's sin, we see God, um, say

946
00:52:18.605 --> 00:52:21.045
that there will be a universal punishment

947
00:52:21.045 --> 00:52:23.405
for sin in the fact that life is going to be a struggle

948
00:52:23.585 --> 00:52:25.765
for all of humanity going forward.

949
00:52:27.145 --> 00:52:28.285
We see in that curse

950
00:52:28.315 --> 00:52:31.005
that this plays out in relational struggles

951
00:52:31.075 --> 00:52:32.405
between the man and the woman.

952
00:52:33.385 --> 00:52:35.685
Um, but we also see that it's just going

953
00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.485
to be difficult to survive.

954
00:52:37.745 --> 00:52:39.845
It says from the sweat of your brow, you're gonna,

955
00:52:40.025 --> 00:52:42.965
you're gonna, um, produce fruit food

956
00:52:42.965 --> 00:52:44.245
for the ground for you to survive.

957
00:52:44.775 --> 00:52:46.205
Where if you think about the condition

958
00:52:46.305 --> 00:52:48.285
before was a abundance, right?

959
00:52:49.025 --> 00:52:52.285
And God was supplying everything There is going

960
00:52:52.285 --> 00:52:54.605
to be difficulty, hardship in life.

961
00:52:54.635 --> 00:52:57.205
It's just gonna be hard to live.

962
00:52:58.145 --> 00:53:00.085
So my question there is how did Jesus

963
00:53:00.895 --> 00:53:03.925
experience this punishment for sin and his earthly life?

964
00:53:15.055 --> 00:53:15.405
Sorry,

965
00:53:15.905 --> 00:53:16.905
Yes.

966
00:53:17.205 --> 00:53:18.405
Ultimately pay paid that.

967
00:53:20.305 --> 00:53:22.965
But how did he experience suffering and hardship and life

968
00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:28.845
Experience lazarous and sw over it?

969
00:53:29.185 --> 00:53:32.485
So experienced death. Yeah.

970
00:53:32.595 --> 00:53:33.685
Loss. Yeah.

971
00:53:35.505 --> 00:53:37.925
So he experienced, um, hunger,

972
00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:41.045
feeling hunger, weariness.

973
00:53:42.465 --> 00:53:43.465
He

974
00:53:44.035 --> 00:53:45.035
Yeah. Yeah.

975
00:53:45.035 --> 00:53:47.925
Just living as a human is hard. Right?

976
00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:52.165
Betrayal. Betrayal. Yeah. He experienced betrayal,

977
00:53:52.165 --> 00:53:53.925
But Jesus didn't have original sin. Right?

978
00:53:54.345 --> 00:53:56.325
But he definitely experienced the punishments,

979
00:53:56.345 --> 00:53:57.525
the consequences of sin.

980
00:53:57.545 --> 00:53:59.165
Yes. No, he did not have original sin.

981
00:54:00.865 --> 00:54:03.405
He was tempted. He was tempted. Yeah.

982
00:54:04.385 --> 00:54:08.365
All the things that just make life hard, Jesus endure.

983
00:54:09.745 --> 00:54:13.445
So this brings us to this second punishment for sin, is

984
00:54:13.445 --> 00:54:15.525
that there will be physical pain and death.

985
00:54:15.745 --> 00:54:19.245
So along with that hardship in life, God issued to Adam,

986
00:54:19.345 --> 00:54:23.045
the penalty of death and decay as a result of his sin.

987
00:54:23.045 --> 00:54:26.325
He says, for you are dust into dust, you shall return.

988
00:54:28.495 --> 00:54:30.405
Let's talk about physical pain and death.

989
00:54:30.665 --> 00:54:33.925
How did Jesus experience physical pain

990
00:54:34.025 --> 00:54:36.885
and death for sin and his crucifixion?

991
00:54:39.635 --> 00:54:44.405
Torture that he endured before physical? Yeah.

992
00:54:48.435 --> 00:54:51.285
Yeah. The torture that he endured going to the paint

993
00:54:51.345 --> 00:54:54.285
or going to the cross wasn't a quick thing for sure.

994
00:54:58.545 --> 00:55:01.325
So the spiritual pain of taking on the sin of the world

995
00:55:01.985 --> 00:55:04.125
became, yeah.

996
00:55:04.355 --> 00:55:05.365
Yeah, that's a good one.

997
00:55:05.365 --> 00:55:06.485
And we'll talk a little bit more of that.

998
00:55:07.665 --> 00:55:11.565
The, just the physical pain endure to,

999
00:55:12.785 --> 00:55:14.365
to think about the flogging

1000
00:55:14.825 --> 00:55:19.725
or having to drag his cross up a hill, being nailed

1001
00:55:19.825 --> 00:55:22.085
to it, hanging there, struggling for breath,

1002
00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:26.405
and then ultimately experiencing death as a human.

1003
00:55:27.185 --> 00:55:29.845
Uh, Jesus absolutely endured physical pain

1004
00:55:29.865 --> 00:55:33.565
and death as a punishment for sin.

1005
00:55:33.565 --> 00:55:38.245
Taking that on. The third punishment we see is

1006
00:55:38.245 --> 00:55:41.365
psychological pain and bearing the guilt of sin.

1007
00:55:43.025 --> 00:55:46.805
So, uh, going back to Genesis, it says, then the eyes

1008
00:55:46.865 --> 00:55:49.405
of both were opened and they knew that they were naked.

1009
00:55:51.065 --> 00:55:54.125
Um, all Christians have experienced this sense

1010
00:55:54.225 --> 00:55:55.725
of shameful exposure.

1011
00:55:56.075 --> 00:56:00.365
When we sin and we know that we've done wrong, um,

1012
00:56:00.385 --> 00:56:02.285
the Holy Spirit convicts us of that, right?

1013
00:56:02.345 --> 00:56:04.845
But there's a consequence, there's a punishment for sin.

1014
00:56:05.265 --> 00:56:07.325
That's just knowing this bitter sense

1015
00:56:07.325 --> 00:56:09.205
that we're we're not right.

1016
00:56:09.395 --> 00:56:10.885
That something is not right,

1017
00:56:11.505 --> 00:56:13.085
and that we're separated from that.

1018
00:56:13.275 --> 00:56:17.445
It's this psychological pain and shame. Guilt of sin.

1019
00:56:18.145 --> 00:56:21.205
So consider for a moment with me, what,

1020
00:56:21.395 --> 00:56:23.645
what this must have been like for Jesus to endure.

1021
00:56:24.545 --> 00:56:26.485
So we have Jesus who's perfectly holy

1022
00:56:26.665 --> 00:56:30.805
and blameless, to suddenly have the full guilt

1023
00:56:30.865 --> 00:56:34.045
of all humanity's sin suddenly be thrust upon him.

1024
00:56:36.825 --> 00:56:39.525
All that he hated most sin.

1025
00:56:42.085 --> 00:56:45.685
Hmm. Was suddenly poured fully out on him,

1026
00:56:47.305 --> 00:56:49.685
having never experienced guilt for sin.

1027
00:56:49.685 --> 00:56:52.445
Something he never experienced in his life.

1028
00:56:52.445 --> 00:56:54.765
Leading up to that, his eternity leading up to that,

1029
00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:59.685
to suddenly dealing with bearing the weight of all sin

1030
00:56:59.705 --> 00:57:01.765
or that guilt being put on his shoulders.

1031
00:57:02.235 --> 00:57:06.285
That must have been crushing to experience as he was there.

1032
00:57:07.585 --> 00:57:10.005
The fourth punishment moving forward is

1033
00:57:10.155 --> 00:57:11.165
what you were referring to,

1034
00:57:11.305 --> 00:57:13.285
the spiritual pain of abandonment.

1035
00:57:14.185 --> 00:57:15.285
So in the garden, Adam

1036
00:57:15.385 --> 00:57:19.405
and Eve hid, when they sinned, they hid from one another.

1037
00:57:20.435 --> 00:57:22.805
They were, remember going back to our conversation

1038
00:57:22.805 --> 00:57:24.965
of being alone, being bad.

1039
00:57:24.995 --> 00:57:26.365
They hid from one another,

1040
00:57:27.025 --> 00:57:29.845
but they also hid from the presence of the Lord God.

1041
00:57:30.705 --> 00:57:33.885
So as a result of sin, fellowship between God and man,

1042
00:57:33.885 --> 00:57:36.925
and between man and fellow, man is broken, broken.

1043
00:57:39.425 --> 00:57:42.085
How do you think that Jesus experienced this penalty

1044
00:57:42.265 --> 00:57:43.525
for sin and his death?

1045
00:57:46.235 --> 00:57:50.685
Hear a lot about Peter, you know, away from Christ.

1046
00:57:52.605 --> 00:57:54.565
I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing all

1047
00:57:56.385 --> 00:57:58.325
the bosses were running around scared

1048
00:57:58.545 --> 00:58:00.405
and thinking this guy's phony

1049
00:58:00.505 --> 00:58:03.445
and looking to take care of themselves.

1050
00:58:03.865 --> 00:58:08.605
It says they all fox.

1051
00:58:12.865 --> 00:58:16.605
It wasn't just separation from his fellow man, his neighbor,

1052
00:58:16.605 --> 00:58:20.325
his friends, but he experienced his spiritual abandon.

1053
00:58:20.585 --> 00:58:22.805
My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

1054
00:58:24.325 --> 00:58:26.345
And then finally we'll end here.

1055
00:58:27.485 --> 00:58:30.985
The last punishment for sin is the wrath of God.

1056
00:58:31.245 --> 00:58:33.465
So finally, the holiness

1057
00:58:33.505 --> 00:58:36.785
and justice of God requires that every single sin be paid

1058
00:58:36.805 --> 00:58:40.865
for sin being by its very nature opposed the existence

1059
00:58:40.865 --> 00:58:43.625
and glory of God demands a righteous

1060
00:58:43.685 --> 00:58:46.945
and a holy fury against it from the God

1061
00:58:46.945 --> 00:58:47.985
who created all things.

1062
00:58:48.855 --> 00:58:51.225
It's what Hebrews talks about as its fearful thing

1063
00:58:51.225 --> 00:58:52.945
to fall into the hands of the living God.

1064
00:58:54.045 --> 00:58:57.185
So we're gonna end before Brad comes up

1065
00:58:57.185 --> 00:58:58.545
and leads us into discussion.

1066
00:58:59.245 --> 00:59:01.505
And I want us to consider about what it actually means.

1067
00:59:01.505 --> 00:59:04.065
That Jesus bore all the wrath

1068
00:59:05.045 --> 00:59:07.465
of the Father against our sins while in the cross,

1069
00:59:10.285 --> 00:59:13.585
how excruciating it must have been as we as wave

1070
00:59:13.755 --> 00:59:18.105
after wave of God's intense anger against sin

1071
00:59:18.695 --> 00:59:20.105
came crashing down on it.

1072
00:59:23.405 --> 00:59:24.565
I try to think about that.

1073
00:59:24.585 --> 00:59:26.205
I'm like, who could possibly bear that?

1074
00:59:26.205 --> 00:59:27.245
None of us do, right?

1075
00:59:27.355 --> 00:59:29.605
None of us could bear the wrath,

1076
00:59:29.745 --> 00:59:34.525
the full on unfiltered wrath of God on sin, all sin.

1077
00:59:35.185 --> 00:59:36.645
And yet Jesus does.

1078
00:59:38.465 --> 00:59:40.005
So I want us to think about that

1079
00:59:40.065 --> 00:59:43.965
and affect the way that they view his last moments

1080
00:59:43.985 --> 00:59:45.005
of Jesus on the cross.

1081
00:59:45.035 --> 00:59:48.445
When he's sitting there and he finally says it is finished.

1082
00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:50.005
He agrees at his last

1083
00:59:50.315 --> 00:59:54.565
because he's just finished enduring the full wrath of God

1084
00:59:55.345 --> 00:59:56.685
on him for all sin.

1085
00:59:57.505 --> 00:59:59.365
And that's what he endured upon.

1086
01:00:00.505 --> 01:00:03.205
So those are the punishments of sin results.

1087
01:00:04.425 --> 01:00:05.965
So I'm gonna stop there, Brad,

1088
01:00:05.985 --> 01:00:07.445
I'm invite you to come on here.

1089
01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:20.125
Thank you Chris.

1090
01:00:25.505 --> 01:00:29.885
Uh, you live me in a bad spot to follow that.

1091
01:00:30.705 --> 01:00:35.245
So, um, I want to touch a ladder note.

1092
01:00:38.045 --> 01:00:42.565
I love true false questions. I love them.

1093
01:00:43.865 --> 01:00:48.685
You know why I have at least 50%

1094
01:00:48.685 --> 01:00:53.165
chance to get it right, better than multiple choice?

1095
01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:55.045
'cause then it goes down to 25.

1096
01:00:55.105 --> 01:00:57.405
And if I have to, you know, write an answer,

1097
01:00:57.545 --> 01:00:58.805
it goes to zero usually.

1098
01:00:59.265 --> 01:01:01.565
So I love true false questions

1099
01:01:03.025 --> 01:01:05.165
and uh, I was going to just

1100
01:01:07.395 --> 01:01:10.165
give out a whole bunch of true false questions tonight

1101
01:01:10.865 --> 01:01:14.245
to get us thinking about more about

1102
01:01:16.065 --> 01:01:18.525
the doctrine of sin, the consequences of sin.

1103
01:01:18.985 --> 01:01:20.885
And that just didn't seem perfect.

1104
01:01:21.795 --> 01:01:26.165
Such as is it sinful to gamble on sports?

1105
01:01:28.915 --> 01:01:30.495
Is Satan your greatest enemy

1106
01:01:31.995 --> 01:01:36.575
or is it a So I'm not gonna do those,

1107
01:01:37.955 --> 01:01:39.215
but I did want to go deeper.

1108
01:01:40.175 --> 01:01:43.695
I I did want to make it a lot more

1109
01:01:44.615 --> 01:01:49.055
personal instead of just trying it as a true false Yes.

1110
01:01:55.265 --> 01:01:58.375
Think about, you don't have to say who it is,

1111
01:01:58.395 --> 01:02:02.335
but you can think about the happiest,

1112
01:02:03.075 --> 01:02:05.535
the most joyful Christian that you know.

1113
01:02:17.555 --> 01:02:20.405
Why are they that way, way, or why were they

1114
01:02:38.845 --> 01:02:39.995
Maybe a better question.

1115
01:02:42.085 --> 01:02:46.035
Would somebody say that you were the most

1116
01:02:46.955 --> 01:02:49.075
happiest and joyful Christian family?

1117
01:02:54.215 --> 01:02:58.355
And so I say all that to, to get down to

1118
01:02:59.145 --> 01:03:00.315
what we're talking about today.

1119
01:03:10.255 --> 01:03:14.995
The greatest, the

1120
01:03:15.275 --> 01:03:18.075
greatest thing in the world is to be a Christian.

1121
01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:24.675
The greatest thing in the world is to be saved.

1122
01:03:27.575 --> 01:03:30.155
And so when he just went through those five things

1123
01:03:31.735 --> 01:03:34.915
and I get lower and lower and lower and lower

1124
01:03:35.095 --> 01:03:36.515
and shorter, you might see,

1125
01:03:41.575 --> 01:03:45.395
do I enjoy my Christian Hood?

1126
01:03:46.215 --> 01:03:50.995
Do I do I love my salvation?

1127
01:03:53.805 --> 01:03:56.155
Psalm 74, for those

1128
01:03:56.175 --> 01:04:01.175
who love their salvation, do we do that?

1129
01:04:04.795 --> 01:04:09.375
Do they see it on your face and in your life?

1130
01:04:10.515 --> 01:04:14.375
Not just some giddy, uh, you know,

1131
01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:18.135
trite, oh praise God Anyway, kind of person,

1132
01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:23.455
but true joy despite

1133
01:04:24.815 --> 01:04:27.175
horrible things that may happen in your life.

1134
01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:39.975
Lemme ask you this. How often

1135
01:04:40.115 --> 01:04:41.775
do you think about your salvation?

1136
01:04:48.475 --> 01:04:49.815
Do you think about it every day,

1137
01:04:53.245 --> 01:04:54.895
once a week, Sundays

1138
01:04:58.155 --> 01:05:01.495
or supper Easter?

1139
01:05:12.235 --> 01:05:15.775
If you think about the, the happiest, most joyful Christian

1140
01:05:15.775 --> 01:05:20.525
that you know, could it be

1141
01:05:23.275 --> 01:05:27.085
that they knew the lost in, in their support,

1142
01:05:27.595 --> 01:05:32.285
that he just, and they knew it down

1143
01:05:32.305 --> 01:05:33.325
to their core

1144
01:05:33.705 --> 01:05:37.325
and down to their Bones.

1145
01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:40.765
They knew their lostness

1146
01:05:40.765 --> 01:05:44.245
and their depravity to such an extent

1147
01:05:45.235 --> 01:05:49.245
that it translated into what Chris just said, I'm

1148
01:05:49.265 --> 01:05:50.485
so happy to be saved.

1149
01:05:52.465 --> 01:05:53.605
Can you believe it?

1150
01:05:56.675 --> 01:05:57.845
It's unbelievable.

1151
01:06:08.525 --> 01:06:12.965
I don't think, I mean, it's hard.

1152
01:06:13.825 --> 01:06:15.365
We all put on a pretty good front,

1153
01:06:17.025 --> 01:06:18.645
all look pretty put together.

1154
01:06:24.785 --> 01:06:26.605
But it's a true joy.

1155
01:06:26.605 --> 01:06:30.125
And it's a true, you know, going back

1156
01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:32.685
to Thanksgiving next week, gratitude

1157
01:06:33.145 --> 01:06:37.685
and thankfulness that all my word, I'm supposed to be dead.

1158
01:06:41.215 --> 01:06:45.055
I have no chance without him. None. Zero.

1159
01:06:47.075 --> 01:06:50.135
And yet he lets me be in his family.

1160
01:06:58.595 --> 01:07:01.415
Am I not happier in my salvation

1161
01:07:03.045 --> 01:07:05.575
because I'm noth in my sin?

1162
01:07:12.565 --> 01:07:13.715
Chris already said it.

1163
01:07:16.535 --> 01:07:19.355
Do we treasure Christ above all?

1164
01:07:22.255 --> 01:07:27.235
Do I love God more than I love Brenda?

1165
01:07:29.495 --> 01:07:34.395
Do I more than you might love your kids

1166
01:07:38.145 --> 01:07:39.275
more than you love yourself?

1167
01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:43.315
And all the things that that entails.

1168
01:07:55.695 --> 01:08:00.075
Why is it that many of us

1169
01:08:00.825 --> 01:08:05.475
have a difficult time seeing us, seeing ourselves

1170
01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:10.435
as totally depraved?

1171
01:08:12.065 --> 01:08:16.485
What, why do we, I'm just asking

1172
01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:21.005
why do we not talk about that more?

1173
01:08:25.345 --> 01:08:26.345
Any thoughts?

1174
01:08:29.885 --> 01:08:32.165
I think it's like a spectrum. I think there's a lot people

1175
01:08:32.165 --> 01:08:36.445
that see themselves as maybe better than other people.

1176
01:08:36.705 --> 01:08:37.845
And like that is a sin.

1177
01:08:38.025 --> 01:08:39.325
But then there's also plenty of people

1178
01:08:39.325 --> 01:08:42.125
that have such like low self-confidence that,

1179
01:08:42.515 --> 01:08:43.525
that they're not good enough

1180
01:08:43.705 --> 01:08:45.125
and matter what they do, they're never

1181
01:08:45.825 --> 01:08:49.965
and you

1182
01:08:50.275 --> 01:08:52.805
beautiful creation from God.

1183
01:08:53.105 --> 01:08:54.845
And that is, that's a blessing.

1184
01:09:23.745 --> 01:09:28.565
How about our, um, our witnessing and our evangelism?

1185
01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:38.005
How does our view of the total depravity

1186
01:09:38.005 --> 01:09:40.565
of man affect that?

1187
01:09:42.875 --> 01:09:44.205
Because I think it should.

1188
01:09:47.965 --> 01:09:51.885
'cause if I, if I look at the person

1189
01:09:52.795 --> 01:09:56.285
that bros across the counter from me or in the drive through

1190
01:09:57.505 --> 01:10:00.845
and I see them as, oh my word,

1191
01:10:00.845 --> 01:10:04.605
they're not gonna make it without him.

1192
01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:07.525
Like there's no hope.

1193
01:10:10.755 --> 01:10:13.125
What does that, does that stir anything up in me?

1194
01:10:13.185 --> 01:10:17.365
You know, does it, does it cause me to say, Hey, do you go

1195
01:10:17.365 --> 01:10:20.365
to church anywhere or have you ever heard of God?

1196
01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:25.165
Or how are you and God or just striking up a conversation

1197
01:10:27.465 --> 01:10:32.045
and yet it's just not cool, right? And it's hard

1198
01:10:32.625 --> 01:10:34.325
And You get embarrassed

1199
01:10:34.465 --> 01:10:38.165
and uncomfortable,

1200
01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.375
Right? I think too, and

1201
01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:47.805
certain people

1202
01:10:48.025 --> 01:10:51.605
and even certain communities, it's sort of easy

1203
01:10:51.705 --> 01:10:54.525
to see the brokenness in the world

1204
01:10:54.665 --> 01:10:56.525
or sort of the wrong on display.

1205
01:10:56.985 --> 01:10:58.525
But I think like a place like Edmond where

1206
01:10:59.175 --> 01:11:02.005
we're good at kind of putting on a face

1207
01:11:02.265 --> 01:11:04.085
and there's more prosperity

1208
01:11:04.145 --> 01:11:06.325
and things like that, it's easy for people

1209
01:11:06.325 --> 01:11:07.525
to feel like, well I don't need that.

1210
01:11:08.225 --> 01:11:11.685
You know, make my life not be better than yours is. Right?

1211
01:11:11.785 --> 01:11:13.445
Or I'm healthier than you are.

1212
01:11:14.465 --> 01:11:18.405
And, but the doctrine of sin teaches us that we're all,

1213
01:11:18.705 --> 01:11:20.525
we all need a savior, right?

1214
01:11:21.145 --> 01:11:23.845
And it doesn't matter how bad it is

1215
01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:26.325
or it's not, it's not circumstantial.

1216
01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:27.445
It's a set thing.

1217
01:11:31.275 --> 01:11:34.565
Sometimes the hardest people to reach are people

1218
01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:37.965
who have it all together and don't have any needs.

1219
01:11:40.025 --> 01:11:44.445
And so I, I want to just, um,

1220
01:11:44.945 --> 01:11:48.205
my wife knows I sit in depravity quite a bit.

1221
01:11:49.365 --> 01:11:53.925
I sit in it a lot, maybe to a fold,

1222
01:11:55.425 --> 01:11:57.685
but it sure makes me appreciate

1223
01:11:59.075 --> 01:12:00.645
much more than I ever have

1224
01:12:03.595 --> 01:12:04.725
that I get to be with him.

1225
01:12:06.875 --> 01:12:09.925
That I get to be in his presence.

1226
01:12:10.045 --> 01:12:11.685
I get to be in his presence right now.

1227
01:12:12.475 --> 01:12:15.885
It's not like, Hey, I get to go to heaven someday. I do.

1228
01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:18.085
I get to enjoy him right now.

1229
01:12:19.825 --> 01:12:23.685
And you know, we should be doing cartwheels.

1230
01:12:24.665 --> 01:12:27.485
You really should. Like, you should be weird.

1231
01:12:28.585 --> 01:12:30.005
You should be very strange.

1232
01:12:30.235 --> 01:12:32.285
It's like, I don't like to be around him

1233
01:12:32.565 --> 01:12:36.005
'cause he's just weird smiling all the time.

1234
01:12:36.775 --> 01:12:39.525
Happy, wanting to talk about God.

1235
01:12:42.755 --> 01:12:47.285
Yeah, we should, we should.

1236
01:12:55.075 --> 01:12:57.885
Last question. I'm,

1237
01:12:59.065 --> 01:13:00.085
I'm preaching to myself.

1238
01:13:01.625 --> 01:13:05.165
I'm not asking you to answer any questions.

1239
01:13:05.945 --> 01:13:07.245
I'm just talking to myself.

1240
01:13:15.305 --> 01:13:17.845
Why will I be happy when I enter heaven?

1241
01:13:19.365 --> 01:13:23.805
I Think that

1242
01:13:26.105 --> 01:13:28.285
what's the chief reason

1243
01:13:30.475 --> 01:13:31.765
that I'm so happy?

1244
01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:53.645
Alright, Brett, Chris,

1245
01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:56.525
Hey, uh, we, we are out of time.

1246
01:13:57.115 --> 01:13:58.925
It's what you guys need to run, go for it.

1247
01:13:59.395 --> 01:14:00.485
What I'd like to do is

1248
01:14:00.485 --> 01:14:03.245
For everybody to line up over here, we're bring car

1249
01:14:04.705 --> 01:14:08.325
all the way across if you're able,

1250
01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:10.725
if you're able. No,

1251
01:14:10.745 --> 01:14:11.965
Uh, I thought let's do this.

1252
01:14:12.415 --> 01:14:14.885
Let's, everybody probably knows it.

1253
01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:18.365
Um, a song that keeps coming to mind.

1254
01:14:19.045 --> 01:14:20.525
I had other ones, but we're out of time.

1255
01:14:21.105 --> 01:14:23.845
Um, anybody know John Newton?

1256
01:14:23.845 --> 01:14:28.485
Is John Newton was, I should say is, uh,

1257
01:14:28.515 --> 01:14:31.885
well he was a, before he wrote the song, amazing Grace.

1258
01:14:32.665 --> 01:14:34.325
He was the captain of the slave ship

1259
01:14:35.585 --> 01:14:39.685
and he was by his own account, a terrible individual.

1260
01:14:40.585 --> 01:14:44.125
And so anyway, he got, he met Christ, changed his life.

1261
01:14:44.905 --> 01:14:47.765
And uh, he wrote the song Amazing Grace that we all sang.

1262
01:14:48.945 --> 01:14:53.045
And he famously said, uh, on his, on his deathbed,

1263
01:14:53.765 --> 01:14:55.045
I think he lost his eyesight.

1264
01:14:55.745 --> 01:14:59.205
And uh, he was losing his mind, uh, just in old age.

1265
01:14:59.825 --> 01:15:03.845
And he was fond of saying, uh, you know, I don't remember

1266
01:15:03.845 --> 01:15:07.085
what I would say it exactly, but, um, he said,

1267
01:15:07.205 --> 01:15:08.605
there's one thing I remember

1268
01:15:09.355 --> 01:15:14.055
and it's that I am a, um, I remember way He said,

1269
01:15:14.115 --> 01:15:17.775
I'm a terrible sinner and God is a great savior

1270
01:15:17.835 --> 01:15:21.455
and Christ is a great savior and I'm, I'm a great sinner

1271
01:15:21.955 --> 01:15:23.935
and Christ is a great savior.

1272
01:15:24.755 --> 01:15:26.495
And anyway, so he wrote these words,

1273
01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:27.735
I want to sing the first line.

1274
01:15:28.355 --> 01:15:31.095
You gotta stand up, join, you know it, sing it

1275
01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:33.255
so you know, listen to me.

1276
01:15:33.805 --> 01:15:36.215
Alright. Amazing.

1277
01:15:39.625 --> 01:15:44.415
Sweet. The sounding saved

1278
01:15:45.645 --> 01:15:48.935
love, like meaning

1279
01:15:51.335 --> 01:15:54.255
I was, was lost.

1280
01:15:55.595 --> 01:15:58.415
But Now I found

1281
01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:00.615
Was My,

1282
01:16:02.035 --> 01:16:05.095
but now I see.

1283
01:16:06.925 --> 01:16:08.735
What do we think for the words of this song

1284
01:16:08.735 --> 01:16:09.855
that we sing easily?

1285
01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:12.855
Like sometimes the words don't even strike us

1286
01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:16.055
as they should, but as we think about John Newton,

1287
01:16:16.325 --> 01:16:20.895
this great center who met this great savior, we're reminded

1288
01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.055
of our own story.

1289
01:16:22.145 --> 01:16:24.775
Maybe by some measure we're not that bad,

1290
01:16:24.775 --> 01:16:26.255
or maybe by others we're worse.

1291
01:16:26.835 --> 01:16:29.455
But at the end of the day, that is the gospel truth

1292
01:16:30.195 --> 01:16:32.935
we take away, is that we are great sinners

1293
01:16:33.235 --> 01:16:36.135
and we live in a world full of great sin

1294
01:16:36.315 --> 01:16:40.575
and wrecked by the fall of, yet you are great savior

1295
01:16:41.115 --> 01:16:43.175
and you are overcoming the world.

1296
01:16:43.715 --> 01:16:45.495
And Lord, we look to you, we love you,

1297
01:16:45.995 --> 01:16:47.455
and we thank you indeed as bread.

1298
01:16:47.475 --> 01:16:51.775
So we thank you for your salvation and Christ holy name.

1299
01:16:52.085 --> 01:16:54.495
Amen. Alright, thank you. Well done.
