00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.400
Even though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death. I

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.900
will not fear for you are with me. You are

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.500
my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.500
You restore me and Lead Me For Your

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.800
Glory.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.300
I long to dwell in your house forever.

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.200
Well, good morning to you church. It's great to see you on this spring

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.000
forward Sunday all bright-eyed. I can

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.000
tell everybody's wide awake. I know you lost an hour

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.300
sleep, but it's okay because you're here. And so that's all that matters.

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.500
We're excited to be together. If you're new to our church.

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
We're thankful. You would come we hope you're welcome and

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.100
encouraged and and challenged in your pursuit of Jesus

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
while you're with us. We'd love to get to know you if we can so, please

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.000
figure out a way for that. It's right and see back in front of

16
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.200
you or just come say hello.

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.800
But if you've been around Henderson Hills for any length of time, you know that almost

18
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.600
four years ago. Now we began a Year's long

19
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.200
journey. It's gonna takes about 15 years that we

20
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.100
figured out to get through the book of Psalms one by one. So we're

21
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.300
gonna take him one at a time 150 there and we hit

22
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.700
him in the Summers. We hit him on these what we call shoulder weeks

23
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.100
like this around spring break. So we're gonna

24
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.800
take a while so stick around and we'll get there eventually by the

25
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.700
way, Alan Rice one of our elders took the Psalms

26
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.100
and and repoatized them back into

27
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.600
English the way that they might have read in the original language

28
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.000
and that's available out at the bookstore. If you want to

29
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.400
be it as a part of the psalm study use those

30
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.000
in your own time.

31
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.400
But before we hit the couple week run up

32
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.200
to Easter that's coming in a few weeks. We are going to

33
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.700
today and next Sunday take the next Psalms up

34
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.500
in order. That's how we're going through. I'm just one at a time. And so

35
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.400
what we're doing today is Psalm 53.

36
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400
So if you're not there yet already turn in your copy

37
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
of God's word to Psalm 53. It's funny as we've walked through

38
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.000
these every one of these has been very timely just not

39
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.400
planning which order and how we get there right

40
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.400
when we're doing them. It's just whatever's next and so Psalm

41
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.800
53

42
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.300
We'll see today is very timely as well. Now before we

43
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300
get into it though. I have an interesting fact about

44
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.000
this Psalm that we need to be aware of before we get

45
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.500
into it Psalm 53 is almost identical to

46
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.500
Psalm 14.

47
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.800
We studied Psalm 14 back in December of 2019. So

48
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.700
it's been three and a half years ago. But except for

49
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.900
verse 5, they're identical nearly.

50
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.400
Now why would that have occurred?

51
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.900
Don't you think that the people who are collating the scriptures back

52
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.000
then would have seen that and been like removing the

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.800
duplicate.

54
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.200
Like when I poured out a handful of Skittles in my hand when

55
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.900
I was a kid, I was always eat the duplicates and just leave the five single

56
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.300
ones right, by the way, that was

57
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.600
back when there was the good stuff the lime not this green apple garbage,

58
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.800
right? The lime stuff was good.

59
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.000
Why would they have left to duplicate though?

60
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.200
Don't you think they would have seen that? Well, it's kind of like the way.

61
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.300
In modern musicals the way Melodies and

62
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.800
rhythms work in modern musicals. You see something

63
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.400
happen early and then it continues on and shows

64
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.000
up again. Later.

65
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.600
But it adds depth that adds meaning and it's a different context and

66
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.400
you learn something about how the musical is working

67
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.200
because of that it develops the storyline as it

68
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.300
fits into the new context.

69
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.200
And so as we look at Psalm 53, yeah lots going

70
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.000
to sound the same as it did three and a half years ago.

71
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.200
But think just for a second how much

72
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.200
has changed in the last three and a half years?

73
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.200
Right. That was BC that was before covid. So everything

74
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.000
has has changed a lot

75
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.500
since then, right? We've all walked through and have

76
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.000
a different perspective in so many things.

77
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.800
That time in our lives revealed a lot.

78
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.100
Just a couple things first. It had it revealed where we

79
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.100
had been putting our hope.

80
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.300
in

81
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.500
our work or finances

82
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.600
Or our planning of our lives or our

83
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.000
government or whatever else that we've been put a lot

84
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.200
of Hope in those things and it exposed that but also that time

85
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.900
revealed how much each of us desires control.

86
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.400
And how when any semblance of that control is

87
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.900
lost?

88
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.800
And people lose it, right. We saw that in

89
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.700
that time frame.

90
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.600
And so I believe each one of us is going to be impacted today by

91
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.300
this repeated psalm.

92
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.700
In a fresh way. We'll see something today. So

93
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.200
Psalm 53 look at it with me now.

94
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.900
The fool says in his heart there is no God.

95
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.700
They are corrupt doing abominable iniquity. There's

96
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.600
none who does good.

97
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.300
God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if

98
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.700
there are any who understand who seek after God.

99
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.000
And they've all Fallen away.

100
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.200
Together they've become corrupt. There's none who

101
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.200
does good. Not even one.

102
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.200
Have those who work evil. No knowledge.

103
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.300
Who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon God.

104
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.900
There they are in great Terror where there is no Terror.

105
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.300
For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against

106
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.500
you you put them to shame for God has rejected

107
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.700
them.

108
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.500
Oh the salvation for Israel would come out of Zion.

109
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.900
When God restores the fortunes of his people let Jacob

110
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.700
Rejoice let Israel be glad.

111
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.300
God help us see what you want us to see today in your

112
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.500
word.

113
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.200
Give us good soil in our hearts that we would receive this and

114
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.900
it would bear good fruit in our lives.

115
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.200
Challenge us where we need it convictus I pray

116
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.000
for someone today who's hurting they be comforted by this.

117
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.500
Lead us in your way everlasting God.

118
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.700
in Jesus name

119
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.800
amen

120
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.400
now just like Psalm 14. This one was also written by David. He

121
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.600
was in a tough spot in his life. He's he's looking around

122
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.200
and he's seeing few people like him that are

123
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.100
pursuing Yahweh. And so it was so bad for him

124
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.000
at this point it got to the point where where he even used one of the strongest biblical

125
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.000
words for someone who had turned away from God and

126
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.200
we saw that in verse 1, that's the word fool.

127
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.100
The Biblical word fool has has so

128
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.200
much behind it. But but listen, it has very

129
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.300
little to do with someone's intellectual capacity.

130
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.400
That's how we often use it today. But but biblically it has

131
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.400
more to do with someone's spiritual capacity.

132
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.600
With with who they are in their

133
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.100
relationship with God where they're Pursuits in Life

134
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.600
or taking them. That's what it means when it says fool.

135
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.300
So it's used here in Psalm 53 that someone who has turned away from

136
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.200
God look at the result. They've become futile. They've become

137
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.900
worthless.

138
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.300
You might call them a good for nothing.

139
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.700
And so when we look at that picture we see yes fools

140
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.600
around us everywhere.

141
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.300
I mean certainly we see fools everywhere on social

142
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.900
media every day on streaming services at school

143
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.300
at work. We see fools all

144
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.300
around us, but instead of merely pointing the

145
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.600
finger outward at everybody else.

146
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.100
I wanted to see that that we can be

147
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.900
foolish as well.

148
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.400
Every one of us can be foolish. Yes fools are

149
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.700
everywhere, but it including inside us.

150
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.700
That there's a fool there, too.

151
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.300
Here's how we get to that. Here's how here's how we can say that.

152
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.200
First what we learn from Psalm 53, is that the fool lives

153
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.500
as if there is no God.

154
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.400
The fool lives as if there is no God, that's

155
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.300
what it says. Right the fool says in his heart. There is no God.

156
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.300
Verse 1 says that that in the deepest part of who he

157
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.400
is or she is the deepest part

158
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.000
of who they are. They've declared absolute Independence.

159
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.000
There's no Authority.

160
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.500
And you see in verses 1 through 4 how that plays out which

161
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.600
that attitude in their heart brings corruption.

162
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.800
It brings evil Deeds. It brings ignorance. It could

163
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.100
even get to the point where somebody starts attacking Believers. That's

164
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.300
what saying no God in

165
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.600
your heart gets to

166
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.700
Now again, this is not saying anything about a person's intellectual

167
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.300
capacity.

168
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.200
Because some of the smartest people in the world can also be the

169
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.300
most foolish.

170
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.300
So why David writes here that if a person claims God does

171
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:57.900
not exist.

172
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.400
It's not that they are misguided in their belief. And

173
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.100
that's it. No, it's actually a gesture of

174
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.000
defiance.

175
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.400
Romans 1:22 says claiming to

176
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.300
be wise they became fools.

177
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.400
And we we know it we have it all together and that's

178
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.300
how they get to being a fool. So this

179
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.400
is not here. This this is not merely philosophical atheism.

180
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.400
Where someone has faith that God does not

181
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.300
exist.

182
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.300
It's not merely philosophical atheism. This is

183
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.800
actually functional atheism.

184
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.700
Where someone is living as if God doesn't exist.

185
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.300
It's what Romans 1:28 says that they

186
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.900
did not see fit to acknowledge God.

187
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.200
It's an act of defiance but it's also an act of

188
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.300
trying to avoid culpability trying to avoid

189
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.200
any potential judgment and saying I don't I don't want to

190
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.900
deal with that. And so no, there's no God.

191
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.500
And so yes, this is when someone says

192
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.400
intellectually an atheist says no, there's no God living

193
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.300
like that. Yes, but see that this

194
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.400
same truth can also be true of anyone.

195
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.400
It can even be true of us as Believers that this can happen that

196
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.800
the fool still lives inside us as well.

197
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.400
Because the reality is no one likes to submit, right?

198
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.100
That that flesh that's inside of

199
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.300
us Rises up when something threatens its Authority

200
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.400
threatens. It's it's Direction in our lives the flesh

201
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.500
wants control and if somebody starts attacking that it's gonna rise

202
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:50.800
up,

203
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.200
But let me be clear about this.

204
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.800
Every time you live outside of

205
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.900
the authority of God in your life.

206
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.600
You choose something do something outside of God's

207
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.300
Authority. You are saying with the fool in verse

208
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.700
1. There's no God.

209
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.100
Functionally, that's what you're saying. Right? Is

210
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:16.500
that not true?

211
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.900
Is it not functional atheism when you do whatever

212
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.500
you want instead of whatever God

213
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.700
says for you to do.

214
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.600
Like that time, I knowingly swiped the answer

215
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.600
sheet in class.

216
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.500
Put it in my binder.

217
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.300
Or every time I knowingly turned on

218
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.100
the computer to go to that website.

219
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.800
Yet in my mind what was running through

220
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.900
there is saying it's not a big deal.

221
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.700
Nothing's going to happen.

222
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.300
Is that not in essence saying with

223
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.000
the fool? There's no God.

224
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.900
You might intellectually think yeah, of course there is but functionally

225
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.100
in that moment, you're saying

226
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.300
no, there's no God. When you cheat on your taxes. Are

227
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.900
you not saying that there's no God.

228
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.500
When you gossip or you slander or you exclude people

229
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.500
are you not saying there's no God?

230
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.200
plus you're eating up your brothers and sisters like Psalm 53

231
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.500
said

232
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.400
like when you live selfishly not generously you're

233
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.700
saying there's no God.

234
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.900
When you lash out at the waiter who messed up your order, you're

235
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.000
saying there's no God.

236
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.700
When you watch that show that dehumanizes men

237
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.700
and women into objects for your pleasure. You're saying

238
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.500
there's no God.

239
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.300
Listen, if you live without the fear of God, you

240
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.400
can claim to be a believer all

241
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.900
you want yet you can act and think functionally no

242
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.400
different than anyone else around us.

243
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.200
And because you've said there's no God, I'm gonna do whatever I want

244
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.100
and you might think I'm immune to that. I

245
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.100
can't no I there's no way I could get there listen apart from

246
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.400
Christ.

247
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.200
That's the only way we can live.

248
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.000
It's the only way we can least all right here versus two and

249
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.000
three God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if

250
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.800
there are any who understands who seek after God. They've all

251
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.800
Fallen away together. They have become corrupt. There

252
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.800
is none who does good not even one.

253
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.900
That's the same argument Paul picks up in Romans chapter 3 when he repeats

254
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.200
this statement and he adds other more intense

255
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.500
phrases explaining our depravity apart

256
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.900
from God.

257
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.900
And I know we talk a lot about that around here that God makes the

258
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.300
believer new spiritually that you are

259
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.000
a new creation. Yes.

260
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.700
But the theological principle here, is that our sinful flesh

261
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.900
still hangs on.

262
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.200
We're still in these flesh suits the sin

263
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.700
Nature's still there even as we're new

264
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.200
and so what that means is that we have been justified

265
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.400
in Christ made right with

266
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.700
God through his bloodshed.

267
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.100
We have been Justified. We are being Sanctified meaning

268
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.200
we're made more like Jesus every day.

269
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.200
But it's still future.

270
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.700
The day that we're going to be glorified.

271
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.200
Which means we're going to be given new bodies that will

272
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.700
be uncorrupted not tainted with sin anymore that sin

273
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.200
nature will be completely gone, but that is still future.

274
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.700
And so until that day that

275
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.300
foolish flesh still wants to

276
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.200
creep up and take over again.

277
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.000
Paul in Romans 7 with this tension of like man, I do what I don't

278
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.300
want to do but I don't do what I want to do and it's like what will deliver

279
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.000
me Jesus?

280
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.200
But we feel the tension, right?

281
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.300
That's what we're talking about here. So yes, there are

282
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:17.900
fools all around us.

283
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.500
There are people who are living as if they are

284
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.600
their own God.

285
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.400
Or living as if that experience is their God.

286
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.000
Or living as if that identity is their God.

287
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.700
Anything that that you set as ultimate is your god is

288
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.600
what we're talking about when you think about God here, but

289
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.400
you and I can slip into that black hole,

290
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:45.700
too.

291
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.100
Where we set God aside in our

292
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.500
lives and we effectively live like an unbeliever again.

293
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.300
There's no God.

294
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.300
But here's what King David saw. He was

295
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.800
lamenting this reality.

296
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.500
He saw it all around him back then but he saw a

297
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.200
glimmer of the future.

298
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.400
in verse 5

299
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.300
There they are in great Terror where there is

300
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.200
no Terror.

301
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.800
For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against

302
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.400
you you put them to shame for God

303
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.800
has rejected them.

304
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.900
What David saw here is that the unrepentant fool

305
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.100
receives God's judgment?

306
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.700
The fool says there is no God the unrepentant fool receives

307
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.800
then God's judgment.

308
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.100
This verse 5 is the major difference between Psalm

309
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.200
14 and Psalm 53.

310
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.100
In Psalm 14, there was a there's more of

311
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.300
an emphasis on God protecting his people.

312
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.600
Here the emphasis is on God's judgment.

313
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.100
But notice this judgment in the verse here is is to

314
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.600
relieve God's people temporarily. Yes,

315
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.400
but there's also a judgment that lasts into

316
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.600
eternity.

317
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.400
permanent

318
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.500
there's a temporary judgment where where those who set themselves

319
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.200
against God. It says that God will give them

320
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.500
fear where there is. No reason for them to fear.

321
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.100
Terror where there is no Terror meaning they're gonna be

322
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.300
scared of leaves falling or Shadows coming they're gonna be scared of

323
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.600
things. They shouldn't be scared of

324
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.400
This actually happened in a big way a couple times in

325
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.300
the Old Testament, but here's one.

326
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.600
Second Kings chapter 7 where where the powerful

327
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.400
Syrian Army had besieged Samaria.

328
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.200
And this Army was the most powerful Army at the time and there

329
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.400
was no way that Israel was going to beat them.

330
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.300
And Syria had set up this Siege and

331
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.900
there was absolutely no way they could lose this battle.

332
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.800
But God had promised his people Deliverance.

333
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.300
And he did it in a miraculous way.

334
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.600
For the Lord had made the army of the syrians hear

335
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.400
the sound of Chariots and of horses

336
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.200
the sound of a great Army so that they

337
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.500
said to one another behold the king of Israel has hired against us

338
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.100
the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against

339
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.500
us and so they fled away in the Twilight and

340
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.600
abandoned their tents their horses and their donkeys leaving

341
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.300
the camp as it was and fled for their

342
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:40.900
lives.

343
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.400
So you see what happened?

344
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.400
Like they're all encamped here. They're all

345
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.300
strong. This Mighty Army. There's no way

346
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.200
they could be beaten, but all the sudden they started hearing something.

347
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.200
And they were scared of the Shadows.

348
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.400
And there was no threat that they actually had but

349
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.200
God caused Terror where there was. No Terror.

350
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.600
And they fled away.

351
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.200
And so it happened back then but listen doesn't that

352
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.400
happen every day, too.

353
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.300
Doesn't this kind of judgment happen today all around

354
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:17.600
us?

355
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.400
And we see people who are not focused on God

356
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.400
seeming to remain in a permanent

357
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.600
state of panic.

358
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.000
I just worrying about everything.

359
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.300
Never able to rest.

360
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.500
needing to medicate

361
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.900
With substances or sports or streaming

362
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.300
services?

363
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.500
Just always on edge.

364
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.200
Even self-proclaimed Believers can get there, right?

365
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.500
Living in this constant state of anxiety by

366
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.200
trying to carry the whole world on your shoulders.

367
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.700
You remember that sculpture of Atlas maybe a

368
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.100
painting you've seen of it where the guys leaning over got the

369
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.600
whole globe on his shoulder.

370
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.800
I've got a picture of that in my office and I've got a big red

371
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.600
circle with a line through it.

372
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.800
But that's what we get to right.

373
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.900
Listen when you functionally remove God and try

374
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.200
to take on the full responsibility of

375
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.400
Life yourself.

376
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.500
Like all the war in the world all the terrorists and

377
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.300
the world all the disease all the politics all

378
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.100
the family drama in your own like you try to

379
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.500
take God out of that and you carry all that. No wonder

380
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.400
there's Terror

381
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.600
No wonder we're anxious. No wonder we're fearful

382
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.400
and worried.

383
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.700
But we must repent of that.

384
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.800
Because God's people ought not to be that way.

385
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.400
Isaiah 26:3 reminds us you

386
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.100
keep him in perfect. Peace whose mind

387
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.500
is fixed on you.

388
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.800
You see that fixed on you.

389
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.400
And I get it. There's a lot of other things factoring into this. There's there's chemical

390
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.300
I get it.

391
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.500
but the most of us

392
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.300
instead of constantly scrolling through

393
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.500
social media feeds that are just filled with Terror.

394
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.100
Or having your favorite cable news station on 24/7. That's

395
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.000
just pandering to you.

396
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.600
And showing you one way and causing fear

397
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.400
in all of that. What Philippians 4 8

398
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.700
9 says we should do instead is whatever is

399
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.600
true. Whatever is Honorable. Whatever is

400
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.600
just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever

401
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.300
is commendable if there's any Excellence if

402
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.900
there's anything worthy of Praise think about these things.

403
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:11.900
How do you do that?

404
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.300
dig deep into God's word

405
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.100
talk about the gospel with brothers and sisters all the

406
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.300
time memorize scripture. Listen to

407
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.800
sermons sing worship songs. Think

408
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.100
about the Lord just constantly fixing

409
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.200
your mind on him. It's like

410
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.400
that old. Well known him says, right.

411
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.500
Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus

412
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.000
Look full in his wonderful face.

413
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.100
and the things of Earth

414
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.500
will grow strangely dim.

415
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.100
in the light of his glory and

416
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.600
grace

417
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.300
fixing your mind on him.

418
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.000
It means we can have no fear.

419
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.200
Because God is with us.

420
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.900
That's what David saw and he hoped in.

421
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.000
For God's enemies though.

422
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.400
That's not the case.

423
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.400
God will often temporarily judge them like

424
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.000
we talked about this constant sense of panic all the time,

425
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.100
but there's even worse coming than that.

426
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.100
You see verse 5 talked about God scattering the

427
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.700
bones of his enemies.

428
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.700
Putting them to permanent shame because he's rejected

429
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:43.900
them.

430
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.300
This is talking about physical death. Of course that this

431
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.200
Army that seems so strong. They might think they're strong.

432
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.400
They cannot stand against the god of creation. He will

433
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.500
win the battle.

434
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.100
But this also points us to something

435
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:03.600
eternal.

436
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.800
because when you tie it with the next verse verse 6

437
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.000
it talks about salvation coming for Israel talks about

438
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.400
restoring The Fortunes of his people that's talking eternity,

439
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:16.600
right?

440
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.600
That's talking eternally that God

441
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.000
restores the fortune because it happened temporarily a few times

442
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.600
but it happens eternally permanently fully. That's what

443
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.300
we're seeing. He's referencing here, but then it

444
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.000
also

445
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.900
Ads layers whenever you think about God rejecting people.

446
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.800
That's what he says here. Right? God has rejected them.

447
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.000
Think about it who are the ones that God Rejects?

448
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.800
Well, James, 4:6 says that God opposes the

449
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.400
proud.

450
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.700
And gives grace to the humble.

451
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.800
That word proud there means self-sufficient.

452
00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.300
independent

453
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.200
maybe like verse 1 says

454
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.100
there is no God.

455
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.300
And God will reject the proud because they've turned

456
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.300
their backs on him because they have said I don't need you

457
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.400
God they've assumed they could do life on their

458
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.100
own even hear me, even if they're not

459
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.700
actively opposed outwardly opposed

460
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.300
to God or to his people this is

461
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.000
an inward in their heart. They have said

462
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.600
I'm opposed to you God.

463
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.700
There is no God. I don't want you to be Lord.

464
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.400
But that's why here let me remind you.

465
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.300
That's why I said

466
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.900
the unrepentant fool receives

467
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.600
God's judgment

468
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.000
because the reality is that all of us.

469
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.400
Will act a fool at some point in our lives, right?

470
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.300
Each of us will allow that flesh to creep back

471
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.800
up and try to take over some of you have even

472
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.800
this morning. It happened for you, right you felt that creep up

473
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.200
and say no don't do the right thing. I want

474
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.300
you to do what I want you to do, right? The flesh will try to come back

475
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.600
over in that but but this is talking

476
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:20.700
about

477
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.200
when the full

478
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.100
dominates

479
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.000
when the fool in US is in control, not God.

480
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.300
When we are unrepentant in that attitude.

481
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.100
That's when God's judgment comes.

482
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.100
That's the image we get here from verse 5 of the enemy in camping

483
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.100
against God and his people.

484
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.600
Like they've set up shop in opposition to

485
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:53.900
the Lord.

486
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.600
It's not just it's not just slipping into that position then

487
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.500
quickly repenting and being back in the presence of God. That's not

488
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.800
what we're talking about. No, this is an active. There's no

489
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.000
God God. I don't need you kind of

490
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.500
opposition.

491
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.200
In fact, it's the lifestyle that we

492
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:15.700
see.

493
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.200
in First Corinthians 6 verses 9 and 10

494
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.800
Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the

495
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.400
kingdom of God?

496
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.100
Do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral nor

497
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.600
idolaters nor adulterers nor

498
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.900
those who practice homosexuality nor

499
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.100
thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards

500
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.000
nor revilers nor swindlers will

501
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.600
inherit the kingdom of God.

502
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.600
You see that though. Did you notice those are all

503
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.200
habitual positions?

504
00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.500
Those are all unrepentant positions.

505
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.400
It's not saying that if you've stolen something in your life, you're

506
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.100
out. It's saying are you a thief?

507
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.600
Is this something you are marked by are you an idolater? Are

508
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.400
you an adulterer is your life marked by

509
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.300
these things that is in camping

510
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.400
against God in Psalm 53.

511
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.300
And saying I've set up shop. This is my identity. This

512
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.900
is who I am. This is what I do. I can't do anything else that's against

513
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.300
God.

514
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.400
And God says he'll put those unbelievers to shame forever.

515
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.500
They've rejected the authority of God their whole

516
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.000
life now. It's just permanent.

517
00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.700
The image we get from this word shame.

518
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.300
In verse 5 the image we get from that word is that

519
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.400
these people these Imaging these people as they're walking as

520
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.800
captured prisoners in

521
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.300
a Victory Parade back into the Winning

522
00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.200
Side City.

523
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.400
So they've been defeated and they've got chains around their hands

524
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.200
and their feet and they're kind of shuffling down the street.

525
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.000
They got guards right next to them watching over them and they've got the city

526
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.500
celebrating the king's Victory

527
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.900
around them, but they're just shuffling in the parade ashamed.

528
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:23.900
hear me that's

529
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.200
that's coming for you if you don't repent.

530
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.500
Like and it's it's it hurts me just it doesn't it's

531
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.300
not fun to say that.

532
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.400
But God's word is clear.

533
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.500
If you reject God in any way, he will reject

534
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:43.800
you.

535
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.700
This is not everybody gets in.

536
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.200
It's not everybody gets a trophy right this is this is

537
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.300
if you reject God, he will reject you you will walk in

538
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.900
Eternal shame.

539
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:01.600
Thankfully.

540
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.100
Thankfully verse 5 is not the end.

541
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.200
Otherwise, we're all in trouble.

542
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.100
David looked at the trials he and his people were facing.

543
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.800
And he had a glimmer of hope.

544
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.300
He had a glimmer of hope as well. Even though

545
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.000
he saw all this around him. He had a glimmer of hope.

546
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.100
Look at verse 6.

547
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.400
Oh that salvation for Israel would come out

548
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.200
of Zion when God restores the fortunes of

549
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.800
his people.

550
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.500
Let Jacob Rejoice let Israel be

551
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.500
glad.

552
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.400
So there there's a two-fold. Hope here notice first.

553
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.600
David's looking at his enemy and camped around God's people the

554
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.700
enemy threatening his life and David recalled that

555
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.800
fear is always groundless because

556
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.400
God always takes counter action against his

557
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:57.700
enemies.

558
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.600
God's always at work for his people even

559
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.400
in the moment, right? We we don't even see it

560
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.100
at times. We don't even understand it most of the

561
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.600
time but we know God is working to bring

562
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.100
about his good purpose.

563
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.100
David looked back at all of his history. All of Israel's history

564
00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.600
and he knew God was good.

565
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.700
And God's at work.

566
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.600
So salvation is coming at least temporarily we

567
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.600
know that but there was also a bigger Deliverance hinted

568
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:28.800
at here.

569
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.100
This language. He uses about salvation coming out

570
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.400
of Zion Zion. Remember is is God's Mountain. It's

571
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.300
a symbol for Heaven For Eternity for Jerusalem. The

572
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.400
new one. He's he's pointing that

573
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.500
as the summary of Eternal salvation that

574
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.500
it would bring Salvation. Plus there's

575
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.200
this request to restore the fortunes of

576
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.300
his people plus they're the words about rejoicing and

577
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.600
being glad right all of this has an eternal

578
00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.300
ring to it.

579
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.600
Is there's Eternal language feeling in

580
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.000
this?

581
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.200
Which by the way that's that's language used all over

582
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.100
the book of Isaiah.

583
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.500
Same kinds of things over and over again saying hey, this is what's coming.

584
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.500
This is what's coming salvation's coming from Zion. That's

585
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.100
all over Isaiah. But then listen to this

586
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.700
Zechariah 9 verse 9. It is explicit here.

587
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.200
It says Rejoice greatly o

588
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.900
Daughter of Zion.

589
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.200
Shout aloud o daughter of Jerusalem behold.

590
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.900
Your king is coming to you.

591
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.800
Righteous and having salvation. Is

592
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.300
he humble mounted on a donkey

593
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.200
on a Colt the foal of a donkey? Who's that

594
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:46.500
talking about?

595
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.300
Let's talk about the Messiah the one we now

596
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.000
know as Jesus the prophecy of the king bringing

597
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.500
salvation out of Zion out of

598
00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.300
the Mountain of God bringing joy and

599
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.200
gladness to his people you see how this all ties together.

600
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.200
So God is offering hope to his people here.

601
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.300
He's saying to Israel through David you're threatened by enemy Nations.

602
00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.500
Hey, you're salvation's coming.

603
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.400
And at times he would bring temporary Deliverance,

604
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.300
but primarily he's offering hope even to

605
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.100
us today.

606
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.000
As we look around and we see an atheistic culture

607
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.200
dominated by lies.

608
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.300
foolishness everywhere around

609
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:31.600
us

610
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.100
and so he's offering hope that there's coming a day salvation will come from

611
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.500
Zion for us to

612
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.000
but at the same time he's offering a hope to even

613
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.500
the fool here.

614
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:51.900
because remember

615
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.300
those fools are not only outside of us.

616
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.200
A fool lives inside each one of us.

617
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.400
each one of us

618
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.000
has that fool in side of us?

619
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.600
Remember Romans 3:23 all have sinned and fall short

620
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.200
of the glory of God.

621
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.100
We're all fools apart from

622
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.700
any intervention of God.

623
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.000
And so we're do his judgment. We are really in a

624
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.800
bad place from birth on.

625
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.700
But that's the beauty of the Gospel.

626
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.000
the beauty of the Gospel

627
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.900
is that Romans 3 continues by saying that we are justified by

628
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.600
his grace as a gift through the

629
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.100
Redemption that is in Christ Jesus.

630
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.500
That he came to do it and he offers it as a

631
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.600
gift even to fools.

632
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.000
Like you and me.

633
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.500
See fools go through life thinking that

634
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.000
there is no ultimate Authority.

635
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.500
But Jesus became the wisdom

636
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.700
of God for us First Corinthians 1 says

637
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.400
by fully submitting every moment to his

638
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.900
father and the will of God.

639
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.300
Fools as we saw live Lives full of

640
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.100
sin full of evil Deeds, but there was

641
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.900
no trace of moral corruption in Jesus.

642
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.300
Psalm 53:4 says fools even eat

643
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.500
up God's people

644
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.800
Well, Jesus was eaten up in our place.

645
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.200
By taking on our judgment all of

646
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.600
the weight and penalty of sin poured on to him

647
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.200
in our place. He was the one

648
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.300
who took all of it for us. And so the question

649
00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.000
I'm going to ask you.

650
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.500
Do you believe that?

651
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.300
Do you believe that do you believe that he

652
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.600
is who he said he is he did what he said he would do and

653
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.300
he accomplished it all if you believe that

654
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.400
then turn from your sin and yourself and turn to

655
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.600
Jesus with your whole life.

656
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.800
Turn to The God Who is there The God Who is real The

657
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.000
God Who came to save you?

658
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.200
and your life

659
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.600
can be filled with joy even even when

660
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.600
the darkness floods in all around us.

661
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.500
your life

662
00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.400
with your eyes fixed on him can be filled with

663
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:36.800
joy.

664
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.600
and believer listen

665
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.800
We should all rejoice and be

666
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.200
glad.

667
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.200
Right. That's what it said.

668
00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.300
It's what it said in Zechariah. It's said

669
00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.600
in Isaiah. That's what it says here at the end of verse 6. Let Jacob

670
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.800
Rejoice let Israel be glad like we as the sons

671
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.500
of Israel like we we can believe

672
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.300
and rejoice and be glad and

673
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.900
live trusting obedient lives.

674
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.400
Why?

675
00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.600
Because our Salvation has come.

676
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.400
Our wisdom has come and our future

677
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.300
is secure.

678
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.500
No matter what we face every day.

679
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.600
those Eternal truths

680
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.400
mean that we can rejoice and be

681
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.000
glad

682
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.600
like Psalm 126 starts with it

683
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.600
says when the Lord restored the fortunes of

684
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.200
Zion.

685
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.900
We were like those who dream.

686
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.300
Our mouth was filled with laughter our

687
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:50.200
tongue with shouts of joy, and

688
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.400
then they said among the Nations the Lord

689
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.700
has done great things for them.

690
00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.700
The Lord has done great things for

691
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.900
us. We are glad.

692
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.500
Are you glad Church?

693
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.400
Are you glad that our salvations are has come are

694
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.500
you glad that our wisdom has come are you glad that your future

695
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.300
is secure if you are we should

696
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.700
rejoice and be glad all day every

697
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.500
day. No matter what we face, right?

698
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.000
This I want to invite the worship leaders out. We're going to rejoice.

699
00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.500
in that truth

700
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.300
that God has won. The battle. God is our Victory. God is

701
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:31.700
our salvation.

702
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.200
And so we should rejoice.

703
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:37.800
and be glad

704
00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.900
we should not be sad about the gospel.

705
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.500
grieve your sin

706
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.100
but Rejoice that our Salvation has come.
