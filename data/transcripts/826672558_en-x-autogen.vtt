1
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.860
Well, good morning. Good morning. That was okay.

2
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.860
I think you can do better than that. Good morning. Great.

3
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.620
So it is great to be with you and, uh, you know,

4
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.940
happy Mother's Day to our mother's. Uh, you know,

5
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.940
I was thinking about Mother's Day, and, uh, I'm reminded of a story. My aunt,

6
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.100
like so many of us, she was touched with a cancer battle.

7
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.380
And, uh, this was a number of years ago while my grandparents were still living.

8
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.460
And, uh, so she was working through that cancer battle. And, uh,

9
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.580
she lived, uh, she lives in Knoxville, Tennessee,

10
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.380
as does my grandparents at the time. And, uh,

11
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.020
as she went through that cancer battle,

12
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.540
one of the things she did is she would go see her mother every day. Actually,

13
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.660
it was every morning. And oftentimes she would actually,

14
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.620
it was early in the morning,

15
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.940
she would get in the bed with her mother and just talk.

16
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.740
Now you gotta understand,

17
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.820
my aunt at this time was in her seventies

18
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.460
and my, my grandmother or sixties, and my grandmother was about in her eighties.

19
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.460
And so my mom asked my grandmother, Hey, what's the deal here?

20
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.540
And my grandmother said, Jan, you never stop being a mother.

21
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.060
Isn't that true? So,

22
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.900
whether you're a young mother or a more mature mother,

23
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.620
we want to honor you. We also recognize, as was said earlier, that sometimes,

24
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.140
um, when it comes to mothers, it gets a little complicated in families.

25
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.500
And so some of you don't know white how to feel about a day like today.

26
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.740
Here's what I want to encourage you with. We have a God who sees you,

27
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.140
who knows you, who loves you.

28
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.980
And I love the fact that the scripture over and over and over,

29
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.700
it gives us a picture of how we understand God.

30
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.820
And that's what we're talking about, knowing God. But you know,

31
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.180
sometimes in the Old Testament and in the New Testament,

32
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.310
God is described as a mother. Isn't that amazing?

33
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.030
So if it's complicated in your family, or if you celebrate today,

34
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.950
here's what we wanna say in all things.

35
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.560
We want to look to our Lord to give us hope and joy,

36
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.360
to give us comfort when it's been hard, and, uh,

37
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.680
to help us on our journey through life, because God has given us life.

38
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.480
So I wanna talk today about, uh, knowing God.

39
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.160
Now, I know in your handout it says that we're looking at, uh,

40
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.840
here come the judge. Here come the judge. Right? But here's the reality.

41
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.160
That's Joel three, one through 16. I thought in light of, uh,

42
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.440
the complicated nature of that passage, which we'll cover next week,

43
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.440
thought it might be good for us to get a glimpse of the end of the story.

44
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.120
So today we're actually looking at Joel three 17 through 21.

45
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.640
So if you have your Bible turned there, Joel three 17 through 21.

46
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.360
And in this passage we're gonna be talking about knowing God. And you say,

47
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.360
Heath, why are you flipping it up? Well, there are a couple of reasons, right?

48
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.240
Uh,

49
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.120
mother's Day is one of the three most attended Sundays on the planet,

50
00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.000
right? That's number one.

51
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.670
So it's a complicated passage that we're gonna be looking at, uh,

52
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.670
in three, one through 16. And, uh,

53
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.830
so I want to give us the end of the story to help contextualize some of the

54
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.070
difficult bit bits that we're gonna handle next week.

55
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.230
The second thing that I want to say is, uh,

56
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.990
that is a long passage of scripture,

57
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.750
and there's a lot of things to work through next week. So, uh,

58
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.030
I thought I might flip it up.

59
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.870
This end of the story's gonna help us understand next week a little bit better.

60
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.390
Okay? So that's why we're doing what we're doing.

61
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.110
So today we're talking about knowing God. Now, if you have your Bible,

62
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.430
turn to three 17, and we're gonna begin reading there. And I'll,

63
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.310
I'll make some comments as we go.

64
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.590
And then I wanna offer three reflections from this passage about knowing

65
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.990
God. Okay? Knowing God.

66
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.750
So three 17 begins, and it reads this way,

67
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.190
then you will know that I am the Lord, your God.

68
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.430
Stop. Then after then, then what?

69
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.650
Well,

70
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.390
the passage is talking about after the judgment described in three,

71
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.790
one through 16. Uh, God judges, uh, certain groups,

72
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.230
and he saves other groups. So we'll talk about that next week.

73
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.110
But it's in that judgment and salvation

74
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.270
after that, when that happens, then

75
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.630
you, Israel will know, I am the Lord your God,

76
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.110
who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain. And let me stop here.

77
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.990
What in the world is Zion? We're you remember that old song, right?

78
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.350
We're marching to Z. Anybody remember that? Or is that just me? Okay,

79
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.190
there's like five of us in this room, awesome. Solidarity. We're together,

80
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.880
right? Zion, what is Zion? Zion is an Old Testament concept.

81
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.720
It's a place, it's the place where God dwells.

82
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.360
Psalm 46 talks about Zion. Uh,

83
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.840
Psalm 95 through 100 talks about God's

84
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.480
kingship and reign in Zion.

85
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.000
Zion is the place where God dwells.

86
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.720
And it's, uh, a, a, a people. That is the people of Jerusalem.

87
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.480
It's a place, it's a city. And in the Old Testament,

88
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.520
particularly in the prophets,

89
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.280
Zion is a city often described as a mother lady Zion.

90
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.360
Zion is the place that has been judged in sin,

91
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.120
but redeemed by God's victorious act. That's Zion.

92
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.480
And here Zion is saved,

93
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.440
delivered by the activity of God.

94
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.320
So once God has delivered Zion and purged it of sin,

95
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.080
he dwells there. So check this out, then you will know that I am the Lord,

96
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.360
your God, who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain,

97
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.080
Jerusalem will be holy. And this is an important point here.

98
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.280
Only God is holy.

99
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.750
So you're not holy. I'm not either, really?

100
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.453
Yeah, really.

101
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.670
There's only one reality that is holy and that is God.

102
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.870
And then what God does out of his holiness,

103
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.190
he makes things holy.

104
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.990
And what is holy in the things that God makes Holy.

105
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.550
It's like in the Old Testament, at the temple, uh,

106
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.670
God would consecrate or the other language that we use in English is sanctify,

107
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.870
make things holy. Another way to say that is not to say, I am holier.

108
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.390
That's a lot of times what we think. We think, oh,

109
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.190
I'm hol you're impure. I'm holier than now.

110
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.670
That's not the picture of holiness. Actually, in the Old Testament,

111
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.670
in the Old Testament, holiness is something that's fit to use.

112
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.630
So, instance at the temple,

113
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.030
God could make a shovel. Holy. Well,

114
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.830
why would he make a shovel? Holy, because that's the, the,

115
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.630
the shovel carried the ashes from the altar and put 'em in a safe

116
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.110
space. God could make a, uh, an altar, holy

117
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.590
God could make a person holy God could make a priest

118
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.550
holy. Only God can do that. We can't do that. Why?

119
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.070
Because there's only one reality that is perfectly holy, and that is God.

120
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.390
And what that means is pure undefiled

121
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.670
completely separate and unique,

122
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.483
that's holy,

123
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.760
but God confers holiness onto human beings.

124
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.840
See how that works? So you can see here already,

125
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.400
Jerusalem will be holy. Why?

126
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.560
Because Jerusalem is so much better than every other place. No,

127
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.720
it's because God has made it holy in judgment and in salvation.

128
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.280
See how that works? So that's what that means.

129
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.400
Jerusalem will be holy.

130
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.880
So we're talking about a time in judgment and salvation where God

131
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.320
reveals himself, that we will know that he is the Lord,

132
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.800
our God who dwells in Zion, his holy mountain,

133
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:38.040
Jerusalem will be holy. And then we see this other thing, foreigners will never,

134
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.320
uh, overrun it again. Now, you might be thinking, oh,

135
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.480
foreigners will never overrun it again, man,

136
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.920
God must be racist or xenophobic. Or maybe he's, you know,

137
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.480
this political party or that this has nothing to do with any of that.

138
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.780
So what you need to understand, and this is getting to next week,

139
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.420
so if you want to know more about this,

140
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.660
come next week and we'll talk a little bit more about it.

141
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.540
But what you need to understand is the story of Israel is the story of

142
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.700
invasion. That is to say, Israel,

143
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.220
when they got into the land,

144
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.780
they were constantly under threat from foreign invasion, asy,

145
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.420
Babylon, I mean, all sorts of other nations as well.

146
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.780
But those are the two biggies, asy and Babylon. Also,

147
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.780
Israel was under foreign occupation in Egypt. In,

148
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.420
in other words, they were in Egypt. And we know this from the Book of Exodus.

149
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.980
They were residing down there, and then they became slaves,

150
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.290
laborers under Egyptian thumb. And then after,

151
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.890
you know, a, a long period of time, they got into the land of Israel,

152
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.610
and they were under a threat by Assyria and then later Babylon.

153
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.130
And they were conquered by both nations,

154
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.210
at least the northern kingdom in 7 22 was conquered by Assyria.

155
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:02.890
And then the Southern kingdom was wiped out by, uh, Babylon in 5 86,

156
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.530
b c e. And then after that, even when they got back into the land

157
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:14.230
in 5 39 BC after they got into the land, and Cyrus, uh,

158
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.470
issued this decree, Israel can go back from their, you know, uh, exile.

159
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.710
They can come back into the promised Land. Even after that,

160
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.310
they were under threat from Persia and they were under foreign

161
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.970
occupation.

162
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:31.750
So what I'm getting at here is the story of Israel is a story where there's

163
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.390
always constant invasion into their land. They're always under threat

164
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.190
from what? From foreign powers who want to oppress them.

165
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.720
So it has nothing to do with xenophobia,

166
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.360
it has nothing to do with, uh, anti-immigration policies or anything like that.

167
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.680
So we gotta kind of separate what the Bible is talking about from our own

168
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.640
political agendas, okay?

169
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.360
And so what's going on here is God is saying, Israel,

170
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.360
you will no longer be under threat in Zion because foreigners won't under,

171
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.920
uh, overrun my borders. Period. Why?

172
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.240
Because God dwells there,

173
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.600
he provides perfect protection and perfect peace.

174
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.440
Now, verse 18 gives further clarification of that picture.

175
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.480
Look at it in that day,

176
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.520
the mountains will drip with sweet wine. Now, we've,

177
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.560
if you're a close reader of scripture,

178
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.560
you've already heard that language of sweet wine,

179
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.080
because it shows up earlier in the book of Joel.

180
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.640
I'll talk about that in a few minutes. In that days, the mountain will drip,

181
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.960
the mountains will drip with sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk.

182
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.120
And you say, gosh, is that, uh, 2% or is that whole milk?

183
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:02.160
Well, uh, do you remember how the land of Israel is described, uh,

184
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.320
by God when he talks about the land, when, when Israel's going into it?

185
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.840
Think about the Book of Exodus and numbers and Deuteronomy.

186
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.560
The land of Israel is described as a land flowing with milk

187
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.520
and honey, sweet things, right? Milk actually,

188
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.920
um, you know, it,

189
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.200
it may be yes from all the livestock, but it's,

190
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.840
it's probably an image talking about fatness and abundance, just like honey is,

191
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.000
honey is maybe bee honey, right? We certainly have that in the land of Israel,

192
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.300
but it also may come from, um, uh,

193
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.820
fig trees and it may come from date palms. The, the, the,

194
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.480
the, the fruit that that's there, that's beautiful. It's delicious.

195
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.960
If you don't like dates, I'm sorry, they, it's good, right? Sweet.

196
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:56.600
It's delicious. But at any rate, the mountains will drip with sweet wine.

197
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.800
The hills will flow with milk. All the streams of Judah will flow with water.

198
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.600
So you have milk and you have wine, and you have water.

199
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.600
And more than that,

200
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.880
you have a spring issuing from the Lord's house watering the valley of the eks.

201
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.240
I'll talk about the valley of the Eks in just a minute.

202
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.440
Egypt will become desolate and eat them a desert wasteland because of the

203
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.200
violence done to the people of Judah in whose land they shed innocent blood.

204
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.040
But Judah will be inhabited forever.

205
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.080
And Jerusalem from generation to generation, I will pardon their blood guilt,

206
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.200
which I have not pardoned for the Lord dwells in Zion.

207
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.040
I'll walk us through verse 21 in just a minute.

208
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:42.960
This passage actually helps us understand what it means to know

209
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.080
God and I, again, three reflections.

210
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.040
Just wanna walk through this quickly and briefly. Uh,

211
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.200
I would love to spend about six hours here,

212
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.760
but I think you would throw tomatoes at me if you have them.

213
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.480
Or maybe your Bible, you just throw it at me six hours. Or maybe, you know, uh,

214
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.520
well, I don't know if I've shared this with you,

215
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.600
but I was a pastor in North Carolina, and, uh,

216
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:11.240
it was a little tobacco road church. It was incredible, uh, little church.

217
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.600
Most of that congregation had grown up, uh,

218
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.400
growing and cutting and drying tobacco, right? So a little church, uh,

219
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.360
called, it's not even in a town, it was called Justice Community, right?

220
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.920
Justice. That's a great name. So I got up to preach and, uh, you know, I said,

221
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.960
well, you know, I, I, you know,

222
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.920
one of the deacons said that I could preach for an hour and a half,

223
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.280
and I thought that was really generous. And this guy out in the,

224
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.560
and I know him now, I mean, I got to know him over my time there,

225
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.520
but he's in the back. And he said this, well, preacher, you can go, how long,

226
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:49.280
however long you want, but we're outta here at noon, right?

227
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.560
So it may be one of those things where, you know, I'm not gonna go long.

228
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.533
I'm really not.

229
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.800
But I do wanna offer some reflections here on what this text teaches us about

230
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.480
knowing God num number one, this is the first reflection.

231
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:06.760
Knowing God is possible. Let me say this again.

232
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.560
Knowing God is possible.

233
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.840
Now, the other day, one of my kids was almost in despair,

234
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.400
why? She's in, uh, getting in more advanced math.

235
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.200
And, uh, she's in this math and she was really frustrated.

236
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.000
She was working through this math problem, and I could see it.

237
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
She was getting more and more frustrated. She needed help. And so she said, dad,

238
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.680
help me. And so I,

239
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:45.160
being the very patient and kind father that I am, I said,

240
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.640
you need to figure this out on your own.

241
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.760
It's been a long time since I've been in seventh grade math, right?

242
00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:00.100
But she was working through this problem. She didn't understand it.

243
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.740
And I said, you can do this. You can figure this out. She said, no,

244
00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.780
I can't. It's not possible. It's not noble. I, I'm just,

245
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.940
I don't know how to do it.

246
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.240
She didn't think that understanding that math was possible.

247
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.100
She felt inadequate to the task. Now,

248
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:28.060
some of us actually have that perspective on God knowing God,

249
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.420
forget it. Impossible. It's not even no way.

250
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.780
God has more important things to do than to bother with me.

251
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.260
My life isn't all that significant. The man upstairs,

252
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.740
he's got stuff to do. I mean, like, run a world or, you know,

253
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.220
care for the universe or, you know, global warming or whatever it might be.

254
00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.430
He's got more important things to deal with than measly old man.

255
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.110
But besides that, he's like, uh, God, how can I ever know him?

256
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.060
Now, I love this because this passage reminds us

257
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.340
not that knowing God is impossible,

258
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.300
but my friends knowing God is actually

259
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:20.170
possible. Have you ever had this perspective?

260
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.170
There's no way I could ever know God. His his ways are,

261
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:30.450
are absolutely too lofty for me. I'm just, I'm just a little worm

262
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.720
compared to the massive weight of divinity.

263
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.450
Well, here's a reality. I don't know what to tell you.

264
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.410
Joel three 17 reminds us that knowing God is

265
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.210
possible. You say he No, no. I mean,

266
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.770
let's go biblical theology here. And biblical theology is a fancy,

267
00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.490
nerdy way of saying that the Bible interprets the Bible. I mean,

268
00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:02.410
doesn't Paul in one Timothy say something like this one Timothy six

269
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:06.250
15 through 16, he is the blessed and only sovereign,

270
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.690
the king of kings, the Lord of Lords,

271
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:13.330
who alone is immortal and who lives. And listen to this phrase,

272
00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:17.650
what Paul says to Timothy. He lives in inapproachable, unapproachable light,

273
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.810
whom no one has seen or can see to him, be honor internal power. Amen.

274
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:29.970
Oh my goodness, God dwells in unapproachable light. Nobody's ever seen him.

275
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.970
How in the world can we know him?

276
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.270
Joel three 17, what does he say?

277
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.590
Then you shall

278
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.730
know. No. And the Hebrew here,

279
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.650
the language in the original text here is not know about.

280
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.150
I mean, I have a driver's license.

281
00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.350
You see me on Sunday, uh, you know, preaching,

282
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.670
and you might think I know Heath,

283
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.510
but I would just say your knowledge of me may be kinda like that driver's

284
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:14.190
license. It's way different than my wife who knows me

285
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.990
deeply, relationally.

286
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.300
See the kind of knowledge that's implied here than you

287
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.380
shall know that I am Lord your God

288
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:33.220
is not driver's license kind of information. Yes, there's Heath. He's five 10.

289
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.580
Yes, he has brown hair, blue eyes. Yes, I know Heath, I know God.

290
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.660
That's not the picture here.

291
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.380
What God is saying is

292
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.680
When he acts in judgment and salvation,

293
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.680
then you will understand. Listen to this,

294
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.760
the very heart and character of God.

295
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.980
You will know him, not know, know about God.

296
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.980
I mean, we're not brains on sticks walking about,

297
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.900
we're human beings and we wanna know somebody.

298
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.810
We want to know them personally. God is saying here,

299
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.770
after he works in judgment and salvation,

300
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.610
then you will know that I am the Lord your God. It's possible.

301
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:29.050
You know, it reminds me we've already seen this language. You will know I will,

302
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.250
you will know, you will know. It happens here,

303
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:35.170
but you remember where else it happens. It happens in Joel 2 27.

304
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:40.370
You will know that I am present in Israel and I am the Lord your God.

305
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.730
And there is no other. My people will never again be put to shame.

306
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.170
That's Joel 2 27.

307
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:50.090
We've seen this before and again here,

308
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.210
it's after God, judges and saves.

309
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:58.370
Then God's people will know the very heart and character of God.

310
00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.810
You will know that I am the Lord your God.

311
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.490
I want us to rest on this phrase. You will know that I am the Lord your God.

312
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.890
Did you know this phrase is like a,

313
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:16.820
it's like, uh, have you ever seen a movie where, uh,

314
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.540
the movie is alluding to or quoting

315
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.670
or kind of pointing back to an old movie?

316
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:30.110
Have you ever seen that? Where you watch this movie and you think,

317
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.190
I've seen this scene before? Yes, you have.

318
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.790
Because that scene in this present movie is drawing on an older movie.

319
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.670
It's kind like that in the Old Testament. We call this

320
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.110
illusion, a l l u S I O N or echoes from other texts.

321
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.350
And that's what's going on here. You shall know.

322
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.110
Do you know where that language first appears? Exodus,

323
00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:01.200
what God says to his people in Exodus, for instance, chapter six, verse seven,

324
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.240
he says, look, I'm going to deliver you.

325
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.120
I'm gonna pour out some plagues on the people of Egypt and after,

326
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.440
and I deliver you from, uh, Egyptian slavery.

327
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.200
He says in Exodus six, seven,

328
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.160
I will take you as my people and I will be your God.

329
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.560
You will know that I am the Lord your God,

330
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.360
who brought you out from the forced labor of the Egyptians.

331
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.680
You will know this is a, a disclosure formula. God says,

332
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.600
I am going to make myself known to you.

333
00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.240
We see it again in Exodus 1612, where God says,

334
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.840
I've heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them, he tells us to Moses,

335
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.800
tell them at twilight, you will eat meat.

336
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.360
It's when they're complaining in the wilderness about they don't have any food.

337
00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:55.200
So God sends them quail. At twilight you will eat meat.

338
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.600
And in the morning you will eat bread until you are full,

339
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:03.040
then you will know that I am the Lord your God. See what's going on here.

340
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.680
When God acts in either judgment or in this case 16,

341
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.920
he gives the manna and quail in salvation,

342
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:18.040
that becomes an indicator on how we understand or how

343
00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.880
we grasp the very heart of God. We know God.

344
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.200
The point here is that knowing God is not

345
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.680
mysterious. It's possible to know God.

346
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.560
Now, some of you in this room are thinking, well, that's, I,

347
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.440
I just don't know about that. I mean, I've never heard him speak.

348
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.600
I I've never talked to him like audibly.

349
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:53.240
So how in the world can I know God? Well,

350
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.880
here's what I would say to you, my friend.

351
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.080
That's one of the reasons he's given us his word. If you wanna know God,

352
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.720
I mean know the heart of God personally,

353
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:08.410
one of the things we can say is God has given us his word that we might

354
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.100
know him. You say, well, I've never heard God.

355
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.460
Let me just ask you a question. How are we doing on the Bible reading stuff?

356
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.070
Because, and I'm not being judgey here.

357
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:27.110
I'm just saying God's given us his words so that we might know him.

358
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.110
How do we know that God is knowable?

359
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.670
Knowing God is possible because he said so in his word.

360
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.140
That's the first reflection. Knowing God is definitely possible.

361
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.060
Some of us might be thinking, well, God doesn't know us.

362
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.900
He doesn't care about us. Yes, he does.

363
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.020
And it's his desire for us to know him.

364
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.340
He wants us to know more than what movies are out there.

365
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.820
He wants us to know more than just how to be good at our job,

366
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.740
how to make money. What's the most, uh,

367
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.980
incredible trend on TikTok? He wants us to know more than that.

368
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.140
He wants us to know him. And it's possible.

369
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.460
This leads us to this second reflection from this passage of scripture.

370
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.940
Not only is knowing God possible, but look at this.

371
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.580
We know God by both presence and absence.

372
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:35.100
Let me say that again. We know God by both presence and

373
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:40.700
absence. You say, huh, I don't remember seeing that in this text.

374
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.470
Well, let me unpack this for you as I do. Let me just say this. Uh,

375
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:52.430
have you ever used this phrase, oh, yes, I know person X, Y, or Z? Oh,

376
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.390
yes, I I know person X, Y, or Z. Of course I do.

377
00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.830
It reminds me of the fact that actually this is a true story.

378
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.830
Once upon a time,

379
00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:09.230
I received a Christmas card from the President of the

380
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.630
United States, and I'm not kidding,

381
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.750
I was as surprised as you are whenever I received it.

382
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.430
And I thought, this is a joke. But sure enough, it wasn't.

383
00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.750
This Christmas card came signed

384
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.590
to my family, from his family,

385
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:35.730
and I thought, huh, president knows me.

386
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.740
Feels pretty good, right? It would be easy for me, right?

387
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.300
To say, oh, yes, I know the president sent me a Christmas card.

388
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.460
Best wishes to your family from our family. Oh, yes, we're tight.

389
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.420
But the reality is,

390
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.380
I don't know this guy at all and he doesn't know me.

391
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.900
You know how this works.

392
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.460
I'm on some list and then on that list,

393
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.620
I got sent a Christmas card. Now it's cool,

394
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.340
but it would be kind of untruthful, wouldn't it? If I were to say,

395
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.140
I know the President, yes, he sent me a Christmas card.

396
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:18.300
Might be good in a social situation, might make everybody say, Ooh,

397
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.030
but it's not true. Now,

398
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:28.030
why do I tell us that story? Because there's a difference, isn't there?

399
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.950
Between, uh,

400
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.990
knowing in theory something and knowing really

401
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:39.590
somebody, it's different than the Christmas cards I get from the people. I love,

402
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:45.350
the people I'm friends with. When they send me a Christmas card, it's, man,

403
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.430
I was thinking about you, Heath, and thinking about your family. We,

404
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:53.110
we just want to give you an update on how we're doing. I, I love this. Uh,

405
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:56.590
the Christmas card thing, it's a little different. In the UK when we live there,

406
00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:01.350
we don't get Christmas cards as much. You know what we get end of year letters.

407
00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.790
And what happens is the people who know us, I mean, my PhD supervisor used to,

408
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:12.790
uh, do this quite a bit. Uh, he would send us, and he still does, but uh,

409
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.070
a little bit older now, but he,

410
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:18.590
he sends us these end of year letters and it kind of debriefs the whole year.

411
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.950
I think that's pretty good practice. You see the difference there,

412
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.950
that end of year letter's radically different than this card that the president

413
00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.813
sent.

414
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:32.950
There's a difference between knowing somebody and just kind of putting a front

415
00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:37.150
out there and saying, well, I know this person.

416
00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.320
Why do I tell you this story?

417
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.360
Because knowing about God

418
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.790
is different than really knowing God.

419
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:57.650
God doesn't want kind of a, a presidential Christmas card kind of knowledge.

420
00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:03.400
He wants to know us, and he wants us to know him.

421
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.360
And what we're about to look at shows us that God reveals himself in both

422
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.440
presence and absence. Let me look at this presence bit.

423
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.320
We know God by his presence amongst his people.

424
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.600
Look at this phrase in three 17,

425
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.280
God who dwells in Zion, who resides,

426
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.320
who sits down

427
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.900
and lives with his people in Zion, that's the image here.

428
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.860
God who dwells in Zion after judgment and salvation,

429
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.220
God dwells amongst his people.

430
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.180
God doesn't want to be a drop-in visitor to your life.

431
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.810
God doesn't want to be a Sunday only resident. In your experience,

432
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.410
God wants to live

433
00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:03.080
among his people to dwell other language

434
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:07.840
gets at this idea. Think about the Johanna or John, the gospel of John.

435
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.320
Uh, the abiding language, same idea.

436
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.200
God is not kind of a, a drop-in visitor or just kind of a Facebook friend.

437
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.280
No, God wants to dwell with his people, his presence.

438
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.440
That's what Ed's talking about. Presence, the presence of God.

439
00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.160
God longs to take up residents among us.

440
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:37.760
God's presence is with his people once they've been purified of their sin and

441
00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.320
purged of evil. And then God dwells with us.

442
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.960
I want you to think about that for a minute.

443
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:51.620
What does it do to your heart to know that the Holy God who created

444
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.380
the universe, the galaxies,

445
00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:58.790
who understands

446
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.820
the end from the beginning, what does it do to your heart to know?

447
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.510
He wants to know you and me personally,

448
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.270
and not just kind of at a distance level.

449
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:18.350
He wants us to dwell with him, and he wants to dwell with us.

450
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:24.770
That's an image that talks about presence.

451
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:31.250
God wants to be present in your life, in the highs, in the lows,

452
00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:35.450
in the triumphs, in the tragedies.

453
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:40.530
God longs to dwell with you

454
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.650
and me. We know God

455
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.070
in terms of this dwelling, his presence,

456
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.390
but in his presence, there are some things that are going to be absent.

457
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:57.613
So we know God

458
00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:03.810
by what is revealed in absence.

459
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:11.470
Uh, before I get to that absence bit, have you ever thought about the,

460
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:16.110
uh, benefits that accompany God's presence? The benefits?

461
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:23.100
What's it like for God to sit down and dwell in your life? You say, well,

462
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.170
I don't think about that. We should Joel us.

463
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.610
Look at verse 18, this image of, you know,

464
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:37.170
in that day, the mountains will drip with sweet wine,

465
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.450
hills will flow with milk. All the streams of Judah will flow with water.

466
00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:45.130
A spring will issue from the house of the Lord watering the valley of the

467
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.840
Acacia.

468
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.050
What we need to understand is Joel doesn't say God wants to dwell with you,

469
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.930
and that's it. No,

470
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:55.170
he gives an entire verse that explains the benefits of God's presence.

471
00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.640
And we shouldn't shy away from this.

472
00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:03.360
Have you ever thought about the benefits of God's presence?

473
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.890
Well, here we see there's sweet wine.

474
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.090
We see the hills are flowing with milk, whatever that means.

475
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:17.090
We also see there's waters and springs to understand the benefits of

476
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.810
divine presence. We need to understand earlier in the the book,

477
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:27.050
we saw the tragedy of divine absence. Do you remember this?

478
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.570
In chapter one,

479
00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:35.530
you had no sweet wine. This is one five, there's no sweet wine.

480
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:38.970
But by three 18, when God shows up, there's sweet wine.

481
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:45.530
In one seven, there's no vine or fig. But by three 18,

482
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.170
the hills are flowing with milk.

483
00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:54.670
In chapter one, verse 10 through 12, there's drought. But now in three 18,

484
00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.190
guess what? There's water flowing everywhere.

485
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.150
And if you don't know, if you've never been to the, the land of Israel,

486
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:06.910
I'm going again, I'm taking, uh, a, a group, uh,

487
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:12.110
I think early, God willing, early December of 2023.

488
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.430
It's one of my favorite places to go.

489
00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.910
But if you've never been to the land of Israel, you gotta understand it is a,

490
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.270
uh, a land that desperately needs water,

491
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.350
right? And if water doesn't come, people die.

492
00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:30.080
Especially in the ancient world,

493
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.680
a land completely dependent on the rains.

494
00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.840
So if there's no water, people are dying. But in God's presence,

495
00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.530
there's lots of water, Water, water everywhere.

496
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:49.670
It's everywhere. So what are the benefits of divine presence?

497
00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.510
Wine, milk, water. More than this. Look at this.

498
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.670
A stream will come up from the temple watering the valley of,

499
00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:00.750
in some of your translations, it might read shaim.

500
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.100
Or in the version that we're looking at the acacia.

501
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.780
Do you know what an acacia cre a tree is an acacia tree.

502
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.340
In the Middle East is a tree that grows in the desert.

503
00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.900
You see what's going on here? God's gonna provide streams in the desert

504
00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:22.240
from his presence.

505
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.100
There are benefits that accompany God's

506
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.860
presence. Maybe you feel like you're going through a drought in your life.

507
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.660
My friends, God's presence provides water for a thirsty soul.

508
00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:46.630
Sometimes we don't like to talk about the benefits of divine presence.

509
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.630
Sometimes we use this kind of language. We say things like, well,

510
00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:54.510
I worship God for who he is, not what he does.

511
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.270
And we think that that sounds spiritual.

512
00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.710
And on the one side, I think that's right. Right?

513
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:06.910
God is not a divine gumball machine. We put in our 25 cents of faith and outs,

514
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:10.390
spits a gumball of good God doesn't work that way.

515
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:14.270
So God's not our glorified divine gumball machine.

516
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.740
And if you don't know what a gumball machine is, get out more. Right?

517
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.340
God is in a, a, a glorified gumball machine. That's true.

518
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.700
But sometimes we forget

519
00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:34.060
that the scripture outlines again and again and again, and it does.

520
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.180
So in this passage, there are benefits to the divine presence in our lives.

521
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:45.330
In here. It's <unk> fertility, beauty,</unk>

522
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.233
life.

523
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.850
I love the fact that over and over and over again,

524
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:56.930
the scriptures remind us of the benefits of following God.

525
00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:01.350
Do you remember Psalm 1 0 3? I love this.

526
00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:08.800
Bless the Lord, owe my soul and all that is within me. Bless his holy name.

527
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:13.800
Bless the Lord owe my soul. And what does it say? Do not forget his benefits.

528
00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:19.240
And then what happens in the rest of that psalm is the psalmist starts to list

529
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:24.060
all of the benefits of God's presence.

530
00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:29.870
God is her healer, our forgiver, our redeemer. God is compassionate.

531
00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.070
He's loving. He's the giver of good gifts. God provides renewal.

532
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:37.680
He is righteous. He confers righteousness. He provides justice. He's patient.

533
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.000
He's long suffering. He's kind.

534
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.740
And those things can be experienced in your life and mind.

535
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:52.130
Likewise, Joel reminds us of the benefits of divine presence.

536
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:55.890
God provides provision, care and life.

537
00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.850
They're benefits to God's presence.

538
00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.450
So God is known by his presence,

539
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.450
but in his presence, there are some things that are gonna be absent.

540
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:11.530
So we know God by what is also absent from His presence.

541
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.410
We know this in verse 17.

542
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.530
Foreigners will never overrun his holy mountain ever again.

543
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:22.930
And what does that actually mean? In the time that he's talking about,

544
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:27.410
there will be an end to all wars. There will be no war,

545
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:32.030
war, war will be absent from God's presence.

546
00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.230
You also see this in the next verse.

547
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.390
Egypt and Eden will be displaced and defeated. You see that? Check it out.

548
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:43.190
Verse 19, Egypt will become desolate at Edom, a desert wasteland.

549
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:46.750
A lot of scholars have said, well, I wonder when this is actually, uh,

550
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:51.590
pictured historically. Well, we don't really know,

551
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:55.630
but here's what I can say in the Old Testament,

552
00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.830
Egypt is the great, uh, power of oppression. In other words,

553
00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:04.070
in the memory of Israel, Egypt is over and over and over again,

554
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:08.270
pictured as the oppressor of God's people. And what about Eden?

555
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:13.710
Now, I mentioned this in 5 86 bc you have,

556
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:17.510
uh, the Neo Babylonian, uh, king Nebuchadnezzar.

557
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:23.130
He conquers the, the nation of Judah. And, uh,

558
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:26.250
in the, the memory of Israel. And you can see this, for instance,

559
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.610
in the book of a Obadiah in the Old Testament.

560
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.210
You can also see it in Lamentations four.

561
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.750
What you find is Edom is Israel's kind of kin brother

562
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.190
and Edom betrays Israel,

563
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:46.710
or in this case Judah and Colludes with the Babylonians

564
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:51.350
so that Edom can get some of the benefits of the Concord territory.

565
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.040
So they're,

566
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.560
they're known as a fraternal country

567
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:59.760
that betrays Judah.

568
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:06.230
So the fact that Edom and Egypt are defeated and never again

569
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.510
will they experience kind of a ancy, what does that tell us?

570
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.470
It tells us that, frankly, check this out,

571
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:19.310
oppression and betrayal will be absent from God's kingdom.

572
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.780
We also see that exploitation will be absent from God's kingdom.

573
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:31.420
We also see that innocent bloodshed murder will be absent from God's

574
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:36.520
presence. We know God by what is not present with God's presence, oppression,

575
00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:38.440
greed, murder, abuse, betrayal,

576
00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:43.640
and sin will not be present in God's presence because God is just kind, fair,

577
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.720
generous, true, holy.

578
00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.520
And when God makes all things new in this time that he's talking about, listen,

579
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.720
he abolishes all the evils of the world and set the world

580
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:59.160
to rights. Mothers. I would encourage you,

581
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:05.560
if you want to help your children, remind them of these things,

582
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:12.700
remind them that God is known

583
00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.420
by what's present in his presence, by what is absent in His presence as well.

584
00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.180
And this is the last thought from this passage.

585
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:26.080
We know God as he makes all things new. You might be saying, well, he,

586
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:31.200
I don't know where this occurs. And you know, all things new.

587
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.440
I don't see that in this passage.

588
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.920
Here's what I would say to you in the Old Testament, especially in the prophets,

589
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.080
what you need to understand is the prophet set a pattern and this pattern is

590
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.200
picked up again and again and again.

591
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.520
And then it shows up in the New Testament,

592
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.280
particularly in the Book of Revelation.

593
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.080
You know that book of Revelation is often called the climax of prophecy.

594
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.000
But I want you to think about this.

595
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:59.960
Joel depicts a time when God judges the wicked and delivers

596
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:04.360
those. He is preserved and he does this.

597
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:07.760
And when he does this, he's gonna dwell in his holy mountain.

598
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:13.200
He's gonna make all things new. There's gonna be no more war, no more grief,

599
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.133
no more tears,

600
00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.920
no more crying water will be flowing from the throne.

601
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:24.680
Does any of this sound familiar? It should

602
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.860
We know God

603
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.200
as he makes all things do.

604
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:36.160
Let me read Revelation 21 and 22.

605
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.800
Not the whole thing. Don't panic.

606
00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.630
Then I heard this is verse chapter 21, verse three.

607
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.510
Then I heard a loud voice from the throne. Look,

608
00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.750
God's dwelling is with humanity. And he will live with them.

609
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:56.510
They will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them and be their God.

610
00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:00.550
Do you see that language? God's dwelling with his people.

611
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.310
He will live away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more grief,

612
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:09.310
crying pain will be no more because of the previous things that passed away.

613
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.470
Then the one seated on the throne, his name is Jesus. He says, look,

614
00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:16.470
I'm making everything new.

615
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.060
And then chapter 22, verse one.

616
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.920
Then he showed me the river of the water of life,

617
00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:29.960
clear as crystal flowing from the Ro throne of God and of the lamb down the

618
00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.560
middle of a city's main, main street.

619
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.960
The tree of life was on each side of the river, bearing 12 kinds of fruit,

620
00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.880
producing its fruit. Every month,

621
00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.160
the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

622
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:41.080
There will no longer be any curse.

623
00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.600
The throne of God and of the lamb will be in the city,

624
00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.280
and his servants will worship him. They will see his face,

625
00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.640
and his name will be on their foreheads. Night will be no more.

626
00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.760
People will not need the lamp of a light of a lamp on the light of the sun

627
00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:56.880
because the Lord God will give them light and they will reign forever

628
00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.680
and ever. Here's what we need to understand.

629
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:04.480
This passage in Joel is pointing us to God's ultimate

630
00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.760
renewal of all things.

631
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.560
When Jesus is on the throne and he makes all things

632
00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.600
new, do you see the similarity?

633
00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:18.040
God dwelling with humanity and revelation God dwelling with his people In

634
00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.000
Zion, new heavens,

635
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.080
you see the water image showing up again and again here from Joel,

636
00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.920
and then Revelation. You see fruit and healing and forgiveness.

637
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:33.840
No curse, divine presence, absence of grief. No more tears,

638
00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:38.020
no more pain. We know God

639
00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:42.390
by how he makes all things new.

640
00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:48.630
And the key to all of this, my friends, is found in verse five, revelation 21,

641
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:54.030
the one seated on the throne. What does he say? Behold, I make all things new.

642
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:58.950
Who is this? Jesus. How does all this happen?

643
00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:02.070
That's pictured in Joel. I'll tell you, it's Jesus.

644
00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.110
If you wanna know God, you look to Jesus.

645
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:10.350
He is the agent of salvation

646
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:15.410
who makes all things new. He can make your life new. You wanna know God,

647
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.273
know Jesus.

648
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.650
Maybe you've never experienced the reality of Jesus in your life.

649
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.330
Maybe you've never experienced the forgiveness that he offers.

650
00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.810
Maybe you have never stepped across the line of faith and said,

651
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:35.410
I want to follow Jesus. I want God's dwelling to be with me.

652
00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:39.610
