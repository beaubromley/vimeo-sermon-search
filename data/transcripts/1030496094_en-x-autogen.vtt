00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:22.045
Well, good morning again, church, it's great to see you.

2
00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:23.405
If you are new to our church,

3
00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:24.685
we're so thankful you'd be here.

4
00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:27.285
We would hope that you feel encouraged

5
00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:29.925
and welcomed, yet challenged in your pursuit of Jesus.

6
00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:32.285
We'd love to have you introduce yourself

7
00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:34.245
to us out at the new here area in the lobby right

8
00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:36.205
after we're done, just so we can get to know you,

9
00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:37.765
ask questions of us, all of that.

10
00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:40.365
We'd love to answer those if we can.

11
00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:42.005
And if you call Henderson Hills home,

12
00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:43.725
it's always great to be together.

13
00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:45.605
Uh, we are so thankful to be able

14
00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:47.565
to walk this journey together towards Jesus.

15
00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:49.565
It is a gift to our souls.

16
00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:52.205
Uh, as we continue our series

17
00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:53.365
through the book of First Samuel.

18
00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:55.405
I wanna share again, a, a well-known illustration.

19
00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:58.685
I've shared this probably two or three times in the last six

20
00:00:58.685 --> 00:00:59.925
or seven years I've been here,

21
00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:02.725
but I feel like it applies well again today.

22
00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:07.285
Uh, so imagine I tell my son to go clean his room.

23
00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:10.085
Now, uh, by the way, that's not a picture of one

24
00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:12.045
of our boys' rooms, just that's a random picture off the

25
00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:14.005
internet, so don't be accusing them of anything.

26
00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:17.725
Uh, but just, you know, I say go clean your room.

27
00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:19.925
It's clear. He knows what I mean. Right?

28
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:23.695
Well, imagine he comes back a couple hours later

29
00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:26.615
and he proudly says, Hey dad,

30
00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:28.815
I memorized what you said.

31
00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:31.255
You said go clean your room.

32
00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:36.585
Like, what? How's, how am I gonna respond to that?

33
00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:38.225
Like, oh, congratulations son.

34
00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:39.825
That's exactly what I wanted you to do, right?

35
00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:41.585
Here's the donut. No, like, how would I respond?

36
00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:43.105
No, go clean your room, man.

37
00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:48.115
So he comes back a couple hours later, said, Hey dad,

38
00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:52.865
listen, uh, I can say go clean your room in Greek.

39
00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:59.065
What? No, go clean your room, man. Like, what?

40
00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:01.815
What are you doing? Okay.

41
00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:04.095
Comes back a couple hours later, he says, okay, dad, listen,

42
00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.415
I've been really taking to heart what you said.

43
00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:07.935
And, uh, here's what we're gonna do.

44
00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:10.855
Me and a couple friends we're gonna gather every week

45
00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:13.575
and we're going to talk about

46
00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:15.695
what it would look like if I cleaned my room

47
00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:19.145
and we're gonna write songs about it

48
00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.785
and sing about cleaning your room.

49
00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:22.625
And we're gonna just sit there

50
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:25.705
and really just, just abide in that statement.

51
00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:29.665
Go clean your room. Like, no, that's not gonna work. Right?

52
00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:34.145
He knows the, the call was to go clean his room.

53
00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:35.945
Like it's, it's abundantly clear

54
00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:38.225
and not just clean it partially like he knows

55
00:02:38.285 --> 00:02:41.865
to clean the room fully and immediately.

56
00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:46.535
Well, something similar actually is

57
00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:48.655
what is the final nail in the coffin

58
00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:51.375
of King Saul's leadership in one Samuel.

59
00:02:53.955 --> 00:02:57.155
Remember, one of the keys to a monarchy working at all

60
00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:02.875
in Israel was the king's obedience to the Lord's commands.

61
00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:06.795
So our passage today will show us

62
00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:08.635
what happened when Saul didn't obey,

63
00:03:10.685 --> 00:03:13.985
but it will also serve as a warning to us today

64
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.105
who call ourselves followers of Jesus.

65
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:21.455
It will, it will caution us to how we handle similar things.

66
00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:24.925
So if you're not already there, go ahead

67
00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:26.125
and take your copy of God's Word

68
00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:29.205
and turn with me to one Samuel, chapter 15,

69
00:03:33.085 --> 00:03:34.145
one Samuel 15.

70
00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:36.225
Look at the whole chapter today.

71
00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:38.505
What we've seen so far in the entire book of one Samuel

72
00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:42.625
as we walk this journey is that Saul has shown glimpses

73
00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:45.465
of what could make him a great king if he

74
00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:46.585
really wanted to be one.

75
00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:51.585
But the prevailing trend in Saul's life has been toward

76
00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:54.155
failure, set up that way.

77
00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:58.335
And then the whole time we've seen very little else.

78
00:04:00.235 --> 00:04:03.335
But God is gracious. Look here at verses one through three.

79
00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:08.455
'cause it seems like God is giving Saul one more chance

80
00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:12.445
to show that he could be the king.

81
00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:15.105
And it's against an enemy

82
00:04:15.105 --> 00:04:17.265
that the Israelites have had since they left

83
00:04:17.275 --> 00:04:18.345
Egypt in the Exodus.

84
00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:21.865
This group of people will see in this section have been a,

85
00:04:22.535 --> 00:04:24.905
just a thorn in the side of Israel,

86
00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:28.525
completely opposed to God.

87
00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:33.865
So God says to Saul, Hey, here's another chance,

88
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:36.495
chapter 15 verse one.

89
00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.535
Samuel said to Saul,

90
00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:41.215
Samuel was God's prophet speaking on behalf of God.

91
00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:43.175
Samuel said to Saul, the Lord sent me

92
00:04:43.175 --> 00:04:45.375
to anoint you king over his people, Israel.

93
00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:49.375
Now therefore, listen, you'll hear a word like that a lot.

94
00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:50.935
Listen to the words of the Lord,

95
00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:53.625
thus says the Lord of hosts.

96
00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:56.105
I have noted what Amalek did

97
00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:58.225
to Israel in opposing them on the way when

98
00:04:58.225 --> 00:04:59.305
they came up out of Egypt.

99
00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:02.545
Now, go Saul and strike Amalek

100
00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:05.625
and devote them to destruction all that they have.

101
00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:10.275
Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child

102
00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:13.875
and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.

103
00:05:15.845 --> 00:05:19.465
Now, before we go any further here, we need to deal

104
00:05:19.465 --> 00:05:20.785
with this difficult idea

105
00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:25.045
that God would command the utter destruction of a people

106
00:05:26.645 --> 00:05:29.375
because it feels kinda like some sort of ethnic cleansing,

107
00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:31.255
weird, sad thing.

108
00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:35.945
And listen, there's no, there's no easy answer to this

109
00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:36.945
that doesn't sound cold.

110
00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:40.265
It's caused people to question their faith.

111
00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:43.585
But here's what we do know about this.

112
00:05:44.565 --> 00:05:46.985
It is God's judgment on sin.

113
00:05:48.455 --> 00:05:52.065
Like I said, these people were completely opposed to God

114
00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:55.025
and to his people in every way, very destructive.

115
00:05:57.255 --> 00:05:58.705
This was God's judgment on sin.

116
00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:01.585
Wrath is always God's judgment on sin,

117
00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:05.135
both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.

118
00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:06.375
Even the New Testament kind

119
00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:11.095
of focuses it toward the end times more eschatological idea

120
00:06:11.355 --> 00:06:13.055
of judgment at the end.

121
00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:15.295
But don't forget, even in the New Testament,

122
00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:17.135
there are scenes like Anani

123
00:06:17.155 --> 00:06:18.615
and Sfi in Acts five,

124
00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:22.255
where God's judgment happens immediately in the moment.

125
00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:28.215
And so God's wrath is always judgment on sin.

126
00:06:30.715 --> 00:06:32.215
But I I we need to consider this.

127
00:06:32.415 --> 00:06:36.105
'cause even in Saul's day, this practice

128
00:06:36.105 --> 00:06:39.585
of wiping out nations was becoming less common,

129
00:06:41.345 --> 00:06:44.775
primarily because it's it's singular purpose.

130
00:06:45.795 --> 00:06:48.935
The only reason God commanded it was clearing the land

131
00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:53.825
for God's people, which also

132
00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:57.025
means that there's no warrant for it today

133
00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:03.655
because it was tied to God's covenant with his people

134
00:07:04.355 --> 00:07:06.695
at that time and for that purpose.

135
00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.255
And so there's no reason for it to happen.

136
00:07:10.275 --> 00:07:14.215
And again, it was then, it was very strategic in that way.

137
00:07:15.475 --> 00:07:18.575
But the the point though, again, no easy answers,

138
00:07:18.635 --> 00:07:22.415
but the point is that the thread throughout the Bible is

139
00:07:22.415 --> 00:07:26.755
that sin will be judged like that's abundantly clear.

140
00:07:26.755 --> 00:07:28.555
That's what we learn here. That's why this happens.

141
00:07:28.655 --> 00:07:30.515
That's why we see Anani survive.

142
00:07:30.695 --> 00:07:32.115
All sin will be judged,

143
00:07:36.035 --> 00:07:38.685
whether that's immediately or in the future.

144
00:07:39.265 --> 00:07:42.405
God is just, sin will be judged.

145
00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:47.115
In fact, what we're seeing from this scene is

146
00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:50.275
that this is a, a foreshadowing of what could even happen

147
00:07:50.455 --> 00:07:54.245
to Saul if he chooses not to follow the Lord.

148
00:07:56.885 --> 00:07:58.185
And so look now what happened next?

149
00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:00.345
That was the command verses four through nine.

150
00:08:00.415 --> 00:08:01.865
Show us really the battle.

151
00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:04.705
This is really the only section of the entire chapter

152
00:08:04.705 --> 00:08:05.985
that deals with the battle.

153
00:08:06.405 --> 00:08:08.625
The focus is on Samuel confronting Saul.

154
00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:11.545
We'll see that, but look at verses four through nine.

155
00:08:13.645 --> 00:08:14.945
So Saul summoned the people

156
00:08:14.965 --> 00:08:18.705
and numbered them in Teim, 200,000 men on foot,

157
00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:19.945
10,000 men of Judah.

158
00:08:20.575 --> 00:08:24.265
Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay wait in the valley.

159
00:08:24.325 --> 00:08:27.745
And Saul said to the kin Knights, this was a, a group

160
00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:29.785
of people that helped the Israelites.

161
00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:31.105
Even though they lived with Amalek,

162
00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:32.665
they helped the Israelites in that journey.

163
00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:35.505
Saul said to them, go depart, go down from

164
00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:38.225
among the malachite, lest I destroy you with them.

165
00:08:38.325 --> 00:08:40.465
For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel.

166
00:08:40.465 --> 00:08:43.545
When they came up out of Egypt, he warned the, the ones

167
00:08:43.545 --> 00:08:44.625
who might be friendly to them.

168
00:08:45.695 --> 00:08:48.235
So the Ken Knights departed from among the malachite

169
00:08:48.655 --> 00:08:52.195
and Saul defeated the Amalekites from Hala as far as shore,

170
00:08:52.195 --> 00:08:53.275
which is east of Egypt.

171
00:08:54.165 --> 00:08:57.525
And he took a gag, the king of the Amalekites, alive

172
00:08:58.025 --> 00:09:00.165
and devoted to destruction all the people

173
00:09:00.515 --> 00:09:01.925
with the edge of the sword.

174
00:09:03.155 --> 00:09:05.175
But Saul and the people spared a gag

175
00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:06.575
and the best of the sheep

176
00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:09.855
and of the oxen, of the fatted calves and the lambs

177
00:09:09.855 --> 00:09:13.355
and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them.

178
00:09:14.635 --> 00:09:16.195
All that was despised and worthless.

179
00:09:16.195 --> 00:09:18.315
They did devote to destruction.

180
00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:25.995
Now, it's interesting the way the narrator

181
00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:29.115
framed this because it's very clear

182
00:09:30.275 --> 00:09:33.775
the contrast between what God had commanded Saul to do

183
00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:38.105
and and what he actually did, right?

184
00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:41.065
So remember verse three, go and strike a mal

185
00:09:41.085 --> 00:09:43.665
and devote to destruction all that they have.

186
00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:46.645
Do not spare anything.

187
00:09:47.345 --> 00:09:50.005
People or animal don't spare anything.

188
00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:51.685
But what do we see Saul

189
00:09:51.685 --> 00:09:53.765
and his men do in verses four through nine?

190
00:09:56.425 --> 00:09:57.435
Like, do you see the difference here?

191
00:09:57.435 --> 00:10:00.215
There's no doubt what happened here.

192
00:10:00.925 --> 00:10:03.575
Saul did not obey God's command.

193
00:10:06.885 --> 00:10:09.455
Well, look at how God responds. Verses 10 and 11.

194
00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:13.945
The word of the Lord came to Samuel.

195
00:10:16.045 --> 00:10:17.805
I regret that I've made Saul King

196
00:10:18.545 --> 00:10:20.965
for he has not turned back from following me

197
00:10:20.965 --> 00:10:23.845
and has not performed my commandments.

198
00:10:25.235 --> 00:10:28.415
And Samuel was angry and he cried to the Lord all night.

199
00:10:29.825 --> 00:10:31.125
Now, we'll come back to the re

200
00:10:31.145 --> 00:10:32.405
regret thing a little bit later.

201
00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:36.815
But, but did you see Samuel's heart here, this prophet

202
00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:40.135
of the Lord who God used to anoint, who's used to lead, like

203
00:10:40.285 --> 00:10:43.295
what a powerful picture of his heart devoted to God.

204
00:10:43.355 --> 00:10:46.655
He is torn up by the fact that Saul did what he did,

205
00:10:46.765 --> 00:10:50.495
that Saul was not the one that God had originally chosen.

206
00:10:50.495 --> 00:10:53.415
Like He, he was wrestling with this reality

207
00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:55.815
that things are going south real fast.

208
00:10:56.365 --> 00:11:00.635
Like our prayer should be God, make us

209
00:11:00.745 --> 00:11:04.795
that committed to your standards, to your holiness, to you

210
00:11:05.015 --> 00:11:08.035
and, and your glory, God, make us that committed,

211
00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:11.635
that we are torn up even when somebody else sins

212
00:11:11.635 --> 00:11:13.475
because it taints the glory of God.

213
00:11:16.025 --> 00:11:17.325
And so what does Samuel need to do?

214
00:11:17.325 --> 00:11:20.045
Well, he needed to find Saul and confront him. Of course.

215
00:11:20.225 --> 00:11:21.605
So look at verse 13.

216
00:11:25.725 --> 00:11:27.145
Samuel came to Saul

217
00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.985
and Saul said to him, blessed be you to the Lord.

218
00:11:30.945 --> 00:11:33.785
I have performed the commandment of the Lord.

219
00:11:35.645 --> 00:11:37.945
Now, did you catch how Saul responded to Samuel?

220
00:11:37.945 --> 00:11:39.865
Samuel shows up and Saul walks

221
00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:41.025
out a little bit of buttering up.

222
00:11:41.245 --> 00:11:42.945
Hey, Samuel, man, hey, you're a,

223
00:11:43.005 --> 00:11:44.385
you are such a blessing to the Lord.

224
00:11:44.485 --> 00:11:48.185
You know that like you're just so great. Love you Samuel.

225
00:11:48.645 --> 00:11:49.945
You're such a great guy.

226
00:11:52.345 --> 00:11:56.845
But then he preemptively tries to cover, watch this.

227
00:11:57.785 --> 00:12:01.085
Hey Samuel, you're a great guy. I obeyed the Lord.

228
00:12:01.505 --> 00:12:03.245
Aren't aren't you proud of me, Samuel?

229
00:12:05.035 --> 00:12:07.915
I obeyed what God commanded me to do. I I aren't you proud?

230
00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:10.635
Now, the only thing Samuel knows at this point is

231
00:12:10.635 --> 00:12:12.275
what God had told him.

232
00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:17.455
Samuel wasn't at the battle. He didn't know how it all went.

233
00:12:17.475 --> 00:12:19.775
That's all he knows. He's walking up to Saul.

234
00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:22.335
All he knows is God said, Saul didn't obey.

235
00:12:22.335 --> 00:12:23.975
And Saul comes to him and says, no, I did.

236
00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:31.315
Which is what makes the next scene so tragically humorous.

237
00:12:32.235 --> 00:12:36.225
'cause Saul had just said, Hey, Samuel, I obeyed.

238
00:12:36.685 --> 00:12:38.065
But now look at verse 14.

239
00:12:40.915 --> 00:12:44.815
And Samuel said, what then is this bleeding

240
00:12:44.915 --> 00:12:47.255
or the sound that a sheep makes?

241
00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:49.775
What then is this bleeding of the sheep in my ears

242
00:12:50.155 --> 00:12:53.015
and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?

243
00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.285
Like Samuel shows up, he's like, wait a sec, salt.

244
00:12:58.305 --> 00:13:02.565
If if you obey, then why am I hearing all these animals?

245
00:13:05.635 --> 00:13:08.335
If you did obey, if God told you to destroy everything,

246
00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:11.255
why do I still hear all of the animals?

247
00:13:14.165 --> 00:13:17.625
It it, it's kinda like when a, when a woman goes to her dog

248
00:13:17.685 --> 00:13:21.305
and asks the dog who ate the lipstick

249
00:13:23.825 --> 00:13:24.765
and the dog's just

250
00:13:24.765 --> 00:13:26.865
like, I don't know what you're talking about.

251
00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:29.505
I have no idea, right? Like, isn't

252
00:13:29.505 --> 00:13:31.225
that the most absurd picture you've ever seen in your life?

253
00:13:31.225 --> 00:13:32.825
Right? It's kind of fun.

254
00:13:32.825 --> 00:13:35.305
Some weeks I get to search for stuff like that. It's wild.

255
00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:37.705
But that's kinda what's happening here.

256
00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:41.585
It's Saul is just like, I obeyed, did I not?

257
00:13:41.685 --> 00:13:44.185
And Saul and Samuels, do you not hear this?

258
00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:47.935
This is exactly what God told you not to do.

259
00:13:50.395 --> 00:13:54.555
And so it seems like Saul is caught just like the dog.

260
00:13:54.555 --> 00:13:57.995
Like just seems like Saul is caught red-handed.

261
00:13:58.055 --> 00:14:02.115
But as we've seen him do so far already, he had an excuse

262
00:14:05.195 --> 00:14:07.495
and his excuse that this is gonna be key

263
00:14:07.495 --> 00:14:08.655
for the rest of our time today.

264
00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:11.695
His excuse seemed like a godly one.

265
00:14:13.585 --> 00:14:15.685
It seemed like he was wanting to do things right.

266
00:14:19.305 --> 00:14:23.115
Look at verse 14 again, then I'm gonna read 15 verse 14.

267
00:14:23.135 --> 00:14:25.155
Samuel said, what then is this bleeding

268
00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:26.235
of the sheep in my ears?

269
00:14:26.255 --> 00:14:31.195
And the lowing of the oxen that I hear, Saul said, they,

270
00:14:32.765 --> 00:14:36.655
they would be, the people have brought them from the

271
00:14:36.785 --> 00:14:40.695
Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep

272
00:14:40.695 --> 00:14:45.175
and of the oxen to sacrifice to the Lord your God.

273
00:14:46.325 --> 00:14:48.065
And the rest we devoted to destruction.

274
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.775
Haven't we seen this before from Saul?

275
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:59.545
Often in Saul's life there was this veneer of religion

276
00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:04.385
where, where, where he even seemed

277
00:15:04.765 --> 00:15:06.705
to be doing things right,

278
00:15:07.205 --> 00:15:09.985
but in his heart he was not following the Lord.

279
00:15:10.645 --> 00:15:15.175
He was doing good actions, religious things,

280
00:15:16.075 --> 00:15:18.465
but in his heart he wasn't.

281
00:15:19.525 --> 00:15:20.975
It's even look at verse 15.

282
00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:24.855
There's a subtle shift when Saul says this to Samuel.

283
00:15:25.635 --> 00:15:30.155
He says, they were sacrifices to the Lord your God.

284
00:15:31.825 --> 00:15:36.465
You see that Saul, the king of Israel,

285
00:15:37.685 --> 00:15:41.335
says to Samuel, Hey, we were gonna sacrifice to your God,

286
00:15:44.825 --> 00:15:47.825
not my God, not our God, your God.

287
00:15:50.185 --> 00:15:51.415
Again, further evidence

288
00:15:51.415 --> 00:15:54.535
that Saul's heart was not toward the Lord at all.

289
00:15:57.535 --> 00:15:58.995
But you have to think about it here.

290
00:15:58.995 --> 00:16:03.515
Wouldn't wouldn't God want the best

291
00:16:03.575 --> 00:16:05.115
of the best animals?

292
00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:09.245
His offerings? It, it sure seems like

293
00:16:09.245 --> 00:16:10.805
that's God, God's desire.

294
00:16:10.805 --> 00:16:12.405
That's what he would want. I mean, why not?

295
00:16:12.515 --> 00:16:14.605
He's, he says everywhere. Bring your best.

296
00:16:14.745 --> 00:16:16.925
We say it here, right? Bring your best to the Lord.

297
00:16:17.005 --> 00:16:18.485
Wouldn't God want this?

298
00:16:21.145 --> 00:16:23.325
Except for the fact that God commanded them

299
00:16:23.345 --> 00:16:24.445
to destroy it all?

300
00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:30.525
It didn't matter how great those sacrifices were.

301
00:16:31.185 --> 00:16:33.765
It was not what God wanted.

302
00:16:37.005 --> 00:16:39.985
And watch how Samuel confronted Saul over his sin.

303
00:16:40.235 --> 00:16:45.015
Verse 16, then Samuel

304
00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:46.615
said to Saul, stop.

305
00:16:50.265 --> 00:16:52.305
I will tell you what the Lord said to me this night.

306
00:16:52.765 --> 00:16:56.345
And Saul said, speak. Look at verse 17 and on.

307
00:16:56.345 --> 00:16:59.345
And Samuel said, though you are little in your own eyes,

308
00:16:59.525 --> 00:17:01.705
are you not the head of the tribes of Israel?

309
00:17:02.325 --> 00:17:04.265
The Lord anointed you king over Israel.

310
00:17:04.445 --> 00:17:05.945
And the Lord sent you on a mission

311
00:17:06.405 --> 00:17:08.985
and said, go devote to destruction the sinners,

312
00:17:09.205 --> 00:17:11.905
the Amalekites fight against them until they're consumed.

313
00:17:12.525 --> 00:17:15.225
Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord?

314
00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:17.925
Why did you pounce on the spoil

315
00:17:18.185 --> 00:17:20.325
and do what was evil in the side of the Lord?

316
00:17:21.795 --> 00:17:25.295
And Saul said to Samuel, I've obeyed the voice of the Lord.

317
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.375
I've gone on the mission in which the Lord sent me.

318
00:17:28.575 --> 00:17:30.775
I brought a gag, the king of Amalek,

319
00:17:30.775 --> 00:17:33.055
and I've devoted the Amalekites to destruction.

320
00:17:33.675 --> 00:17:36.935
But the people took the spoil sheep

321
00:17:36.935 --> 00:17:39.375
and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction,

322
00:17:39.555 --> 00:17:42.295
to sacrifice to the Lord your God, in Gilgal.

323
00:17:44.665 --> 00:17:49.605
So notice what Samuel was even doing for Saul in the moment.

324
00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:52.805
Saul was, was bringing excuse after excuse.

325
00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:53.885
And Samuel comes to him

326
00:17:53.885 --> 00:17:56.285
and says, Hey listen, I'm gonna give you a way outta this.

327
00:17:58.215 --> 00:18:00.515
I'm gonna give you a chance to repent

328
00:18:00.735 --> 00:18:02.035
and to fix your mistake

329
00:18:02.105 --> 00:18:04.395
that you could actually make this right.

330
00:18:04.615 --> 00:18:07.875
But what does Saul do? He again shifts the blame.

331
00:18:12.245 --> 00:18:14.105
It was the people who took all those animals.

332
00:18:14.245 --> 00:18:16.665
Sam, come on Samuel, the people, I couldn't stop 'em.

333
00:18:16.665 --> 00:18:21.545
The people took the animals they wanted

334
00:18:21.545 --> 00:18:22.785
to sacrifice to your God.

335
00:18:22.785 --> 00:18:24.465
Samuel, come on, give 'em a break.

336
00:18:28.235 --> 00:18:29.375
How tragic though, right?

337
00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:35.585
Deflecting, pointing fingers,

338
00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:38.565
trying to excuse your behavior.

339
00:18:41.435 --> 00:18:44.035
Grateful that we've moved past that in our day, haven't we?

340
00:18:46.795 --> 00:18:49.695
No. Right? We all do this daily.

341
00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:51.855
We all do this.

342
00:18:52.075 --> 00:18:55.975
But the truth of the matter here is that excuses never work.

343
00:19:01.025 --> 00:19:05.275
Never excuses

344
00:19:05.565 --> 00:19:06.875
never work.

345
00:19:08.085 --> 00:19:09.285
'cause here's what Saul had done.

346
00:19:10.705 --> 00:19:12.195
Saul had listened to the wrong voice.

347
00:19:14.665 --> 00:19:15.615
Whose voice did he listen?

348
00:19:15.615 --> 00:19:16.775
He listened to the people's voice.

349
00:19:17.745 --> 00:19:19.525
He listened to his own selfish voice.

350
00:19:19.865 --> 00:19:21.805
He listened to every other voice

351
00:19:22.425 --> 00:19:24.365
except the voice of the Lord.

352
00:19:27.325 --> 00:19:30.625
He even said that he did it, but did he? No.

353
00:19:31.885 --> 00:19:33.785
He partially might have done it,

354
00:19:34.675 --> 00:19:36.015
but he didn't listen to the Lord

355
00:19:36.035 --> 00:19:38.095
and say, I'm going to follow you in every way,

356
00:19:38.105 --> 00:19:40.455
which compromised his obedience to God.

357
00:19:41.405 --> 00:19:42.465
He listened to the wrong voice.

358
00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:52.045
And so Samuel responds, really, this is the,

359
00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:54.565
the next couple verses is the key section we've been

360
00:19:54.685 --> 00:19:56.685
building to for the last five chapters.

361
00:19:58.825 --> 00:20:01.765
All these weeks we've been looking at this narrative build

362
00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:05.605
and build and build to culminate here in verses 22 and 23.

363
00:20:06.135 --> 00:20:07.965
Watch what Samuel says to Saul

364
00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:14.045
and Samuel said, has the Lord

365
00:20:14.145 --> 00:20:16.565
as great delight in burnt offerings

366
00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:20.085
and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord.

367
00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:25.445
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice.

368
00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:30.845
And to listen than the fat of rams for rebellion is

369
00:20:30.845 --> 00:20:35.535
as the sin of divination, witchcraft, presumption is

370
00:20:35.535 --> 00:20:37.055
as iniquity and idolatry

371
00:20:38.245 --> 00:20:41.135
because you have rejected the word of the Lord.

372
00:20:41.835 --> 00:20:44.735
He has also rejected you from being king.

373
00:20:47.005 --> 00:20:51.825
Just powerful. And

374
00:20:51.985 --> 00:20:54.705
I wanna work backwards on that, those two verses.

375
00:20:54.705 --> 00:20:56.945
Let's work up from the end to the beginning of

376
00:20:56.945 --> 00:20:59.065
what Samuel said to Saul here, this is really critical.

377
00:20:59.065 --> 00:21:02.385
Watch this. Saul had rejected God's word,

378
00:21:02.685 --> 00:21:05.145
so God rejected him from being the king.

379
00:21:07.755 --> 00:21:10.895
But it wasn't just that Saul had failed one time.

380
00:21:13.325 --> 00:21:16.345
It wasn't that he just, he kind of made a mistake

381
00:21:16.565 --> 00:21:17.825
and he failed one time.

382
00:21:17.935 --> 00:21:21.065
It's that his heart was not oriented towards the Lord.

383
00:21:21.285 --> 00:21:24.785
He didn't want to obey, he didn't want to listen to God.

384
00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:28.025
He didn't wanna seek God. He wanted to try to pacify God.

385
00:21:31.955 --> 00:21:36.065
Which then you move up verse 23, it says that

386
00:21:36.065 --> 00:21:39.265
that's basically the same thing as witchcraft.

387
00:21:41.325 --> 00:21:44.045
Rebellion is like witchcraft.

388
00:21:46.285 --> 00:21:47.615
It's like idolatry.

389
00:21:47.645 --> 00:21:51.495
When you presume upon yourself it's as bad as idolatry.

390
00:21:53.405 --> 00:21:54.705
Do you see what he's doing here?

391
00:21:57.415 --> 00:22:02.235
What he's saying is that all of it, every single sin,

392
00:22:02.415 --> 00:22:05.155
no matter what class we might put it in, every one

393
00:22:05.155 --> 00:22:07.235
of it separates you from God.

394
00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:12.535
It's not that you have to be perfect to earn salvation,

395
00:22:12.725 --> 00:22:15.615
because every one of us idolize, every one of us,

396
00:22:15.685 --> 00:22:17.495
presume every one of us rebel.

397
00:22:17.595 --> 00:22:18.895
We all do it.

398
00:22:19.045 --> 00:22:21.815
What he's talking about here is it gets to your heart.

399
00:22:23.655 --> 00:22:25.945
Even David will see him in a couple weeks show up.

400
00:22:26.245 --> 00:22:28.145
He doesn't live this out perfectly,

401
00:22:28.405 --> 00:22:32.065
but his heart was towards God, a man after God's own heart.

402
00:22:32.255 --> 00:22:33.465
It's about the heart.

403
00:22:33.655 --> 00:22:36.945
Just because someone on the outside like Saul looks

404
00:22:37.705 --> 00:22:42.385
religious, if their heart is not toward

405
00:22:42.685 --> 00:22:45.345
the Lord, all those actions are useless.

406
00:22:49.775 --> 00:22:53.915
And what this says, what Samuel says, is that they are just

407
00:22:54.215 --> 00:22:58.915
as guilty as an idol worshiper, as someone

408
00:22:58.915 --> 00:23:03.075
who worships a false God, as an adulterer, as someone

409
00:23:03.495 --> 00:23:05.355
who makes a deal with the devil.

410
00:23:05.855 --> 00:23:08.635
It doesn't matter. You might be religious on the outside,

411
00:23:08.635 --> 00:23:10.995
but if your heart is not towards God, it's the same

412
00:23:11.135 --> 00:23:12.075
as adultery

413
00:23:16.755 --> 00:23:18.485
because what does God really want?

414
00:23:18.545 --> 00:23:20.085
You keep moving up that section, right?

415
00:23:20.085 --> 00:23:21.805
What does God really want? Verse 23

416
00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:24.605
for rebellion is the sin is divination.

417
00:23:24.605 --> 00:23:27.725
Presumption is the sin of iniquity and idolatry.

418
00:23:27.835 --> 00:23:30.205
What he said prior to that, behold

419
00:23:30.265 --> 00:23:33.405
to obey is better than sacrifice

420
00:23:35.855 --> 00:23:38.675
to listen than the heart, uh, the

421
00:23:38.675 --> 00:23:39.995
to listen than the fat of rams.

422
00:23:39.995 --> 00:23:41.555
Like you can offer all these sacrifices.

423
00:23:41.735 --> 00:23:45.845
God wants you to listen to him. God wants you to obey him.

424
00:23:45.865 --> 00:23:48.765
That's way better. God cares about sacrifices.

425
00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:52.605
The entire book of Leviticus is about sacrifices.

426
00:23:53.025 --> 00:23:57.125
God cares about how they're done well in the Old Testament.

427
00:23:57.225 --> 00:24:02.145
But what does he want more? He wants the worshiper heart.

428
00:24:03.045 --> 00:24:07.495
He wants the heart. He wants your heart.

429
00:24:07.555 --> 00:24:10.935
He wants my heart. He wants every worshiper hearts.

430
00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:14.895
What what that means is that he wants that person to listen

431
00:24:15.395 --> 00:24:19.135
to his word, want to and want to obey.

432
00:24:20.485 --> 00:24:25.305
That's what he wants. He doesn't even

433
00:24:25.305 --> 00:24:29.505
want the best animal sacrificed to him

434
00:24:29.775 --> 00:24:32.345
because that person, listen, this,

435
00:24:33.955 --> 00:24:35.165
this is what we can get to.

436
00:24:35.165 --> 00:24:37.325
This is the temptation of religious people like us.

437
00:24:37.915 --> 00:24:40.965
This is where we can get. He doesn't even want that

438
00:24:41.725 --> 00:24:44.085
sacrifice best, the best offering given.

439
00:24:44.225 --> 00:24:47.765
He doesn't even want that when someone is using it

440
00:24:48.105 --> 00:24:49.765
to cover up the rest of

441
00:24:49.765 --> 00:24:51.165
what they're doing with the rest of their life.

442
00:24:55.555 --> 00:25:00.415
You ever done that before? You've gone to church,

443
00:25:00.595 --> 00:25:04.175
you've posted scripture on your social

444
00:25:04.175 --> 00:25:05.535
media like you're supposed to.

445
00:25:05.675 --> 00:25:07.175
You're, you've given money,

446
00:25:07.175 --> 00:25:09.015
you've even served in the church,

447
00:25:12.215 --> 00:25:13.675
yet the rest of your life

448
00:25:16.445 --> 00:25:19.355
looks completely contrary to the way of Jesus.

449
00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:28.855
Jesus very clearly said it, quoting Isaiah in Mark seven,

450
00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:32.895
six, Jesus said this, people honors me with their lips,

451
00:25:34.185 --> 00:25:37.475
but their heart is far from me.

452
00:25:41.415 --> 00:25:44.625
I've, I've been there man, like

453
00:25:46.685 --> 00:25:50.765
I've been there where everything else looks far from God.

454
00:25:50.765 --> 00:25:53.545
But I've gotta put that front, that facade.

455
00:25:53.545 --> 00:25:58.125
I've gotta make it look right. Can I tell you something?

456
00:25:58.585 --> 00:26:03.535
It is miserable. It, it is.

457
00:26:03.895 --> 00:26:07.225
I useless in the end.

458
00:26:08.605 --> 00:26:09.785
What's, what's the benefit of it?

459
00:26:09.815 --> 00:26:12.545
It's that people appreciate or respect you in some way.

460
00:26:12.545 --> 00:26:16.925
You get what you want. It's useless in the end.

461
00:26:22.875 --> 00:26:25.245
What does God want more than religious actions?

462
00:26:25.635 --> 00:26:27.605
More than offerings, more than sacrifices.

463
00:26:27.605 --> 00:26:30.565
What does God actually want the most? He wants your heart.

464
00:26:33.035 --> 00:26:36.965
He says, to obey is better than sacrifice.

465
00:26:38.645 --> 00:26:41.225
To obey is better than singing songs.

466
00:26:41.565 --> 00:26:42.905
To obey is better than given.

467
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.525
Money to obey is better than sir like, to obey is

468
00:26:46.595 --> 00:26:47.805
what God wants.

469
00:26:48.225 --> 00:26:52.485
But what that means is there must be a fundamental change in

470
00:26:52.485 --> 00:26:56.605
your desires that you actually want to obey him.

471
00:26:59.555 --> 00:27:04.295
And that desire to obey him only comes from the orientation

472
00:27:04.635 --> 00:27:09.125
of your life being toward him, right?

473
00:27:09.125 --> 00:27:11.885
You see that you're not gonna wanna obey him if you don't

474
00:27:11.885 --> 00:27:13.605
even want to follow him.

475
00:27:16.725 --> 00:27:20.025
And so when you have that desire to follow him, then

476
00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:23.225
as your king, he is someone you want to listen to.

477
00:27:23.405 --> 00:27:25.865
You wanna say, okay, God, what do you want? Say to me?

478
00:27:25.975 --> 00:27:28.025
What do you want to lead me into?

479
00:27:28.025 --> 00:27:31.025
Because I want to obey what you want me to obey.

480
00:27:31.105 --> 00:27:34.425
I wanna listen to you. My heart is oriented towards you.

481
00:27:34.665 --> 00:27:36.105
I want you See how this all works?

482
00:27:36.935 --> 00:27:39.265
There's gotta be a fundamental change inside

483
00:27:39.265 --> 00:27:43.545
because I can only sustain those actions of religiosity,

484
00:27:43.885 --> 00:27:45.265
of churchianity.

485
00:27:45.545 --> 00:27:49.095
I can only do that for so long. I'm gonna fail at that.

486
00:27:50.285 --> 00:27:53.445
I can't sustain it because it doesn't come from inside me.

487
00:27:54.955 --> 00:27:59.555
But when my heart is changed by the spirit of God,

488
00:27:59.825 --> 00:28:03.235
then my heart then wants to follow him.

489
00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:06.435
It wants to go clean my room when he tells me to do it

490
00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:07.515
and I'll do it joyfully.

491
00:28:13.085 --> 00:28:17.655
None of that was true of Saul, right? That that was not he.

492
00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:21.215
He was more focused on making sure everybody else was happy.

493
00:28:22.965 --> 00:28:25.265
He wanted to make sure everybody else had what they wanted.

494
00:28:25.265 --> 00:28:26.625
He wanted to make sure that he looked good.

495
00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:29.545
He even built a memorial to himself in response

496
00:28:29.545 --> 00:28:32.025
to this victory over the Amalekites.

497
00:28:32.695 --> 00:28:35.515
He wanted to make sure he looked good, that he had a veneer

498
00:28:35.515 --> 00:28:37.675
of religion that might appease God.

499
00:28:37.675 --> 00:28:38.715
Like that's what he was trying.

500
00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:41.675
He was all focused on himself. It didn't work.

501
00:28:44.445 --> 00:28:45.785
God saw right through it.

502
00:28:48.965 --> 00:28:53.325
He knew Saul's heart. He rejected him.

503
00:28:57.995 --> 00:29:00.085
Well, you can imagine that. Finally hit Saul.

504
00:29:02.305 --> 00:29:04.125
All this has happened. Saul finally

505
00:29:04.645 --> 00:29:06.205
recognizes what has happened.

506
00:29:07.795 --> 00:29:09.945
Everything we've been building to it's now final

507
00:29:11.235 --> 00:29:13.205
that Saul had officially been

508
00:29:13.405 --> 00:29:15.005
rejected as the king of Israel.

509
00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:18.755
He stays in the position for a few more chapters,

510
00:29:18.755 --> 00:29:20.035
we'll see going forward.

511
00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:23.955
But he's rejected as king of Israel. He will not sustain it.

512
00:29:24.735 --> 00:29:26.435
God is going to replace him.

513
00:29:26.435 --> 00:29:30.315
And watch how Saul tried to respond and just feel this.

514
00:29:31.805 --> 00:29:33.955
Maybe this is something you felt in your life.

515
00:29:35.885 --> 00:29:40.555
Verse 24, Saul said to Samuel,

516
00:29:41.205 --> 00:29:45.005
I have sinned for I have transgressed the commandment

517
00:29:45.005 --> 00:29:48.125
of the Lord and your words because I feared the people

518
00:29:48.185 --> 00:29:49.405
and obeyed their voice.

519
00:29:50.105 --> 00:29:52.205
Now therefore, please pardon my sin

520
00:29:52.205 --> 00:29:55.285
and return with me that I may bow before the Lord.

521
00:29:56.465 --> 00:29:59.005
And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you.

522
00:29:59.425 --> 00:30:01.205
You have rejected the word of the Lord.

523
00:30:01.385 --> 00:30:04.525
The Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel.

524
00:30:04.865 --> 00:30:08.765
As Samuel turned to go away, Saul sees the skirt

525
00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:10.365
of his robe and it tore.

526
00:30:11.625 --> 00:30:13.965
And Samuel said to him, the Lord has torn the kingdom

527
00:30:13.965 --> 00:30:15.525
of Israel from you this day

528
00:30:16.505 --> 00:30:17.765
and has given it to a neighbor

529
00:30:17.765 --> 00:30:19.325
of yours who's better than you.

530
00:30:21.305 --> 00:30:24.275
And also the glory of Israel will not lie

531
00:30:24.295 --> 00:30:26.475
or have regret, for he is not a man

532
00:30:26.475 --> 00:30:27.715
that he should have regret.

533
00:30:29.155 --> 00:30:33.215
And then Saul said, I've sinned yet honor me now

534
00:30:33.275 --> 00:30:36.535
before the elders of my people and before Israel

535
00:30:37.155 --> 00:30:40.955
and return with me that I may bow before the Lord your God.

536
00:30:42.575 --> 00:30:45.515
So Samuel turned back after Saul and Saul bowed

537
00:30:45.935 --> 00:30:47.075
before the Lord.

538
00:30:47.815 --> 00:30:52.125
Now we read that and we wonder,

539
00:30:52.305 --> 00:30:56.725
had Saul changed it, it sure seemed like now I've sinned.

540
00:30:56.795 --> 00:30:59.125
I've done everything wrong. Had Saul changed?

541
00:30:59.505 --> 00:31:00.965
It seems like he's repentant.

542
00:31:04.285 --> 00:31:07.665
But again, did you see his perspective in verse 30?

543
00:31:07.985 --> 00:31:08.985
I emphasized it right.

544
00:31:09.085 --> 00:31:10.985
He still wanted to be honored

545
00:31:11.405 --> 00:31:13.465
before the Lord, before his people.

546
00:31:16.115 --> 00:31:18.135
He was still focused on himself.

547
00:31:19.045 --> 00:31:20.815
He's like, Samuel, please, I don't wanna look

548
00:31:20.835 --> 00:31:21.895
bad in front of my people.

549
00:31:22.195 --> 00:31:25.255
So Samuel, can you come with me and and let me bow down

550
00:31:25.255 --> 00:31:26.975
before you and it looks like I'm doing the right thing.

551
00:31:26.975 --> 00:31:28.295
That's kind of what he's saying, right?

552
00:31:30.095 --> 00:31:32.285
Again, he could have owned up.

553
00:31:32.545 --> 00:31:34.605
He could have said, I'm guilty.

554
00:31:34.785 --> 00:31:37.245
He could have said, I am wrong. I failed.

555
00:31:37.645 --> 00:31:39.725
I could even go make it right, right.

556
00:31:39.725 --> 00:31:44.035
Now, imagine if he goes and he takes care of the king

557
00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.835
and he goes and takes care of all the sheep.

558
00:31:46.055 --> 00:31:49.715
He could have made it right at the time. But Saul never did.

559
00:31:53.235 --> 00:31:57.085
Saul never did. And it sets us up this tension between Saul

560
00:31:57.145 --> 00:32:00.045
and whoever this new king will be in the upcoming chapters.

561
00:32:01.245 --> 00:32:04.055
This neighbor, who Samuel says, is better than you,

562
00:32:04.715 --> 00:32:08.455
not better morally, better focused on the Lord

563
00:32:08.595 --> 00:32:10.335
as a king should be in Israel.

564
00:32:11.485 --> 00:32:14.225
And there will be a tension that we'll see play out over the

565
00:32:14.225 --> 00:32:15.945
next few chapters.

566
00:32:20.185 --> 00:32:25.135
But watch the sad conclusion here, Samuel

567
00:32:25.355 --> 00:32:29.535
and Saul, part ways never to speak again.

568
00:32:31.375 --> 00:32:36.045
Verse 34, Samuel went to Rama and Saul went up to his house

569
00:32:36.065 --> 00:32:40.085
and Gibbon and Samuel did not see Saul again

570
00:32:40.085 --> 00:32:41.165
until the day of his death.

571
00:32:42.905 --> 00:32:45.125
But Samuel grieved over Saul

572
00:32:46.595 --> 00:32:47.615
and the Lord regretted

573
00:32:47.615 --> 00:32:50.135
that he had made Saul King over Israel.

574
00:32:50.845 --> 00:32:52.095
What a tragedy, isn't it?

575
00:32:55.595 --> 00:32:59.985
This whole chapter, man like Saul, this man

576
00:32:59.985 --> 00:33:04.965
with such great potential anointed

577
00:33:04.965 --> 00:33:06.805
as God's first king of Israel,

578
00:33:10.005 --> 00:33:11.505
yet a man whose heart wasn't in it.

579
00:33:13.695 --> 00:33:17.155
His heart was not devoted to the Lord.

580
00:33:19.875 --> 00:33:22.655
And that caused God much grief,

581
00:33:25.365 --> 00:33:28.455
knowing what he had to do to replace Saul with a new king

582
00:33:28.615 --> 00:33:30.335
that was a man after God's own heart.

583
00:33:30.395 --> 00:33:31.695
But but that's the idea.

584
00:33:31.695 --> 00:33:34.455
That word regret, God doesn't change.

585
00:33:34.595 --> 00:33:36.095
God doesn't need new information.

586
00:33:36.485 --> 00:33:40.935
It's the idea of what it does to his heart that that that's

587
00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:42.215
what sin does.

588
00:33:43.435 --> 00:33:46.695
It brings sorrow, great sorrow

589
00:33:47.155 --> 00:33:48.535
to God's heart.

590
00:33:52.345 --> 00:33:54.885
But how do we reconcile this? It seems like God regrets.

591
00:33:54.905 --> 00:33:56.565
It says it. But what we learn here is

592
00:33:56.565 --> 00:33:58.965
that somehow in his sovereignty, God chooses

593
00:33:58.965 --> 00:34:00.725
to respond to human actions.

594
00:34:01.705 --> 00:34:06.425
But his purposes and plans never change God's way above us.

595
00:34:06.485 --> 00:34:09.345
He, we can't understand this, but that's how he's set it up.

596
00:34:09.455 --> 00:34:12.985
That he somehow responds to disobedience when it comes

597
00:34:13.285 --> 00:34:17.465
and responds to obedience when it comes to us,

598
00:34:17.525 --> 00:34:18.625
it seems like, but,

599
00:34:18.685 --> 00:34:21.585
but that's the way God has set it up to work out.

600
00:34:21.585 --> 00:34:24.185
Because you remember this, one of the key stipulations

601
00:34:24.365 --> 00:34:27.225
for the King of Israel was that they were

602
00:34:27.545 --> 00:34:31.185
to be wholeheartedly devoted to God

603
00:34:31.365 --> 00:34:33.305
and obeying his commands.

604
00:34:36.485 --> 00:34:40.785
If they failed at that, remember they were to repent.

605
00:34:40.975 --> 00:34:42.345
They were to turn back to him.

606
00:34:43.045 --> 00:34:46.735
If they didn't return, if their heart was not

607
00:34:47.495 --> 00:34:51.175
oriented toward him, then God says, I will reject you.

608
00:34:52.865 --> 00:34:54.885
So is God dependent on us?

609
00:34:54.945 --> 00:34:56.605
No, that's the way God set it up to work.

610
00:34:56.865 --> 00:34:59.925
And so he would reject a king who wasn't focused.

611
00:34:59.945 --> 00:35:02.925
That's why God had said to Saul, I'm gonna replace you

612
00:35:02.925 --> 00:35:05.765
with a man after your after God's own heart.

613
00:35:07.115 --> 00:35:09.735
That's the key. Remember the heart is the issue.

614
00:35:12.405 --> 00:35:15.585
But he said to the king, you must obey me.

615
00:35:18.885 --> 00:35:21.585
But listen, don't we have the same key stipulation

616
00:35:21.645 --> 00:35:26.575
for us today, like

617
00:35:26.575 --> 00:35:28.055
as his representatives on earth,

618
00:35:28.695 --> 00:35:30.645
which the king was his representative in Israel

619
00:35:30.665 --> 00:35:31.765
as his representatives on earth.

620
00:35:31.985 --> 00:35:36.305
Now, aren't we supposed to be wholeheartedly devoted

621
00:35:36.445 --> 00:35:39.565
to listening to His word and obeying his word?

622
00:35:41.685 --> 00:35:43.065
And when we fail, what do we do?

623
00:35:43.245 --> 00:35:45.305
We turn back to him in repentance.

624
00:35:45.305 --> 00:35:46.705
That's what we're called to do.

625
00:35:46.885 --> 00:35:51.345
But here is a key difference that king

626
00:35:52.315 --> 00:35:56.275
failed, rejected the key difference for us.

627
00:35:57.375 --> 00:36:00.825
If we are his by faith,

628
00:36:02.235 --> 00:36:03.455
he will never reject us.

629
00:36:06.255 --> 00:36:07.275
Now what's the difference?

630
00:36:09.605 --> 00:36:12.255
Shouldn't we as Christians get rejected just like

631
00:36:12.255 --> 00:36:13.415
that king get rejected?

632
00:36:13.415 --> 00:36:15.415
Shouldn't that be the case? Why is it different now?

633
00:36:15.445 --> 00:36:19.855
Because we have a substitute who perfectly

634
00:36:20.515 --> 00:36:22.575
obeyed all of God's commands

635
00:36:22.795 --> 00:36:26.935
and then who also died as our substitute so we wouldn't have

636
00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:28.575
to die because of our failures.

637
00:36:30.405 --> 00:36:33.145
See, that's the truth that changes everything is

638
00:36:33.145 --> 00:36:35.425
that Christ obeyed perfectly.

639
00:36:38.205 --> 00:36:41.665
The king was supposed to obey. He failed our king.

640
00:36:42.115 --> 00:36:45.665
Check this out, right? Our king who now reigns overall,

641
00:36:46.005 --> 00:36:47.385
he did obey perfectly.

642
00:36:47.525 --> 00:36:49.225
And so he has the right to stand

643
00:36:49.325 --> 00:36:50.665
as the permanent king forever.

644
00:36:53.055 --> 00:36:54.735
'cause here's what Hebrews four 15 says,

645
00:36:54.735 --> 00:36:58.495
that we do not have a high priest who is unable

646
00:36:58.555 --> 00:37:00.095
to sympathize with our weaknesses.

647
00:37:00.395 --> 00:37:04.015
We have a high priest who in every respect has been tempted

648
00:37:04.315 --> 00:37:07.135
as we are yet without sin.

649
00:37:10.815 --> 00:37:13.265
There's a lot of research going on in our world that

650
00:37:13.895 --> 00:37:15.705
asks people who call themselves Christians,

651
00:37:15.935 --> 00:37:17.305
theological questions.

652
00:37:18.525 --> 00:37:20.985
One of those questions that's often asked is, did Jesus sin?

653
00:37:21.675 --> 00:37:24.785
There is a shockingly high amount of people

654
00:37:24.785 --> 00:37:25.945
who call themselves Christians and say,

655
00:37:25.945 --> 00:37:27.025
yeah, Jesus sin just like me.

656
00:37:27.025 --> 00:37:30.005
He's a man. That's a problem

657
00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:33.205
because then we don't have a standard

658
00:37:33.545 --> 00:37:37.605
or we don't have a, a substitute in our place taking on the

659
00:37:37.665 --> 00:37:40.125
sin that we did on a perfect sacrifice.

660
00:37:40.225 --> 00:37:42.045
And so we don't have that first of all.

661
00:37:42.105 --> 00:37:44.165
But then the flip side is called the double

662
00:37:44.185 --> 00:37:45.245
double imputation.

663
00:37:45.505 --> 00:37:48.485
We also then don't have any righteousness planted on us

664
00:37:48.515 --> 00:37:49.965
because of his perfection.

665
00:37:51.885 --> 00:37:55.025
That's why Jesus being perfect is so critical for us

666
00:37:57.395 --> 00:38:00.245
because he said He is perfect.

667
00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:01.725
He lived it out. He is perfect.

668
00:38:01.985 --> 00:38:04.565
And so he takes our sin as our substitute.

669
00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:08.405
And then he gives us his righteousness as our substitute

670
00:38:08.405 --> 00:38:09.565
because he perfectly obeyed.

671
00:38:10.465 --> 00:38:12.755
That is a key part of the gospel.

672
00:38:13.215 --> 00:38:14.835
You cannot be a Christian

673
00:38:16.815 --> 00:38:18.155
if you don't have that covering you.

674
00:38:19.355 --> 00:38:22.905
You might be religious, but it's not a heart change.

675
00:38:26.125 --> 00:38:27.745
And so I want to, I wanna just say something

676
00:38:27.745 --> 00:38:29.665
because I know this is where I've been.

677
00:38:31.935 --> 00:38:33.945
When we hear sermons

678
00:38:33.945 --> 00:38:35.925
or Bible studies about obedience,

679
00:38:39.695 --> 00:38:41.395
we all sit in this feeling of like,

680
00:38:41.415 --> 00:38:42.595
man, I failed this morning.

681
00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:47.165
God's telling me I'm supposed to obey. He wants my heart.

682
00:38:47.545 --> 00:38:50.925
My heart was not oriented to him even an hour ago, right?

683
00:38:50.925 --> 00:38:52.045
Like, and we're sitting here,

684
00:38:52.045 --> 00:38:53.205
we get discouraged, get overwhelmed.

685
00:38:53.205 --> 00:38:55.045
We get sad. We get beaten up

686
00:38:56.825 --> 00:38:58.885
by a pastor just says, you need to obey, right?

687
00:38:58.885 --> 00:39:01.125
We're supposed to listen and obey, trust and obey.

688
00:39:01.125 --> 00:39:02.525
There's no other way to be happy in Jesus

689
00:39:03.225 --> 00:39:04.245
and trust and obey, right?

690
00:39:04.245 --> 00:39:05.405
Like that's, that's what we hear.

691
00:39:06.225 --> 00:39:10.375
But we sit here and we think I, I can't.

692
00:39:12.065 --> 00:39:13.825
I struggle with that. I'm not perfect at it.

693
00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:16.485
And so I just wanna blow this down for a second.

694
00:39:16.565 --> 00:39:18.165
I want us to sit here in this

695
00:39:21.375 --> 00:39:24.825
Christian, listen, God never

696
00:39:25.215 --> 00:39:26.705
regrets saving you.

697
00:39:31.415 --> 00:39:34.115
He says He regretted making Saul King.

698
00:39:34.115 --> 00:39:36.075
It's 'cause he was so grieved over the sin.

699
00:39:37.815 --> 00:39:40.945
Christian God never regrets saving you

700
00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:46.505
even when you don't go clean your room.

701
00:39:49.025 --> 00:39:50.325
He knew what he was buying.

702
00:39:51.265 --> 00:39:52.485
He knew what he was getting into.

703
00:39:53.525 --> 00:39:56.705
He knew what you would be like when he was purchasing

704
00:39:56.705 --> 00:39:57.905
you on the cross.

705
00:39:58.205 --> 00:40:00.745
Now, he wants you to listen to nor obey, not just

706
00:40:00.745 --> 00:40:02.785
because He wants you to 'cause it's good for us.

707
00:40:04.155 --> 00:40:07.005
It's better. Our life is better in a sense

708
00:40:07.325 --> 00:40:09.125
whenever we do listen and obey.

709
00:40:09.305 --> 00:40:12.725
But he also knows that he doesn't want

710
00:40:13.325 --> 00:40:15.205
religious rituals with no heart.

711
00:40:17.655 --> 00:40:22.465
He doesn't want that. He wants

712
00:40:22.485 --> 00:40:23.545
you to listen and obey,

713
00:40:23.545 --> 00:40:24.905
but he doesn't want it done with no heart.

714
00:40:25.125 --> 00:40:29.625
But when you fail, if your heart is toward it,

715
00:40:29.625 --> 00:40:34.185
when you fail, and you will, the truth

716
00:40:34.405 --> 00:40:37.585
of the gospel is that you have an advocate.

717
00:40:38.745 --> 00:40:42.245
You have someone who stands in your place in death

718
00:40:42.585 --> 00:40:45.045
and stands in your place in life

719
00:40:47.195 --> 00:40:50.175
and he never regrets saving you.

720
00:40:51.465 --> 00:40:55.655
What? Great love is this right church. That kind of love.

721
00:40:57.075 --> 00:41:00.295
That's what makes me want to listen to him.

722
00:41:02.485 --> 00:41:06.975
That kind of love is what makes me want to hear his commands

723
00:41:07.205 --> 00:41:09.735
that are good for me as he leads me in grace.

724
00:41:12.725 --> 00:41:14.255
It's that kind of love that's so great.

725
00:41:14.255 --> 00:41:18.095
That makes me want to obey him in every way.

726
00:41:20.665 --> 00:41:21.805
Not because I have to, but

727
00:41:21.805 --> 00:41:25.805
because I've been given the grace to do it.

728
00:41:28.695 --> 00:41:30.995
So let's reflect on that as I pray for a moment here.

729
00:41:35.805 --> 00:41:37.735
Reflect on that great love of God.

730
00:41:49.065 --> 00:41:50.815
We're gonna take the Lord's supper here in a moment

731
00:41:50.955 --> 00:41:55.655
to remind us of the broken body and shed blood of Jesus.

732
00:41:55.835 --> 00:41:58.255
But, but Jesus, remember, Jesus did that

733
00:42:01.725 --> 00:42:04.255
because he loves you.

734
00:42:07.085 --> 00:42:08.335
Christian. Rest in that.

735
00:42:10.675 --> 00:42:13.615
Let that spur and compel us towards obedience and action.

736
00:42:18.525 --> 00:42:22.375
When we hypocritically live a life

737
00:42:22.375 --> 00:42:26.295
that we're not living on the inside, let's just stop,

738
00:42:27.365 --> 00:42:29.255
confess it, own up

739
00:42:30.515 --> 00:42:35.095
and say, Jesus, I wanna follow you in his grace.

740
00:42:36.225 --> 00:42:37.095
He'll meet you in it.
