WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.035 --> 00:00:01.125
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:01.745 --> 00:00:04.005
Uh, if you're new to our church, we're glad you're here.

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.005
We're thankful that you would choose to worship with us.

4
00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:07.445
We'd love to meet you if we can.

5
00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:10.685
Uh, there's a big new here area out there in the lobby.

6
00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:14.045
Uh, also if you call Henderson Hills home, uh,

7
00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:15.605
we also love to see you.

8
00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:17.965
It's great to gather together like this every week.

9
00:00:17.965 --> 00:00:20.725
It's such a joy to be a family like that.

10
00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:25.565
For the past couple months, we've been examining many facets

11
00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:27.965
of the diamond called God's faithfulness.

12
00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:32.805
How selected passages out of one Corinthians have shown us

13
00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:36.725
that in unique ways, that he is faithful,

14
00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:39.325
that he is trustworthy, he's dependable,

15
00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:43.565
he is someone we can have full confidence in, someone

16
00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:46.005
that we can base our whole lives on

17
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:50.125
and we can found our future and our present on.

18
00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:53.005
And so today, in light of all of that,

19
00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:56.125
just like we did last week, therefore four

20
00:00:57.605 --> 00:00:59.255
because he is faithful,

21
00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:01.055
therefore we are then empowered

22
00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:05.215
to live a faithful life in response to respond

23
00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:06.975
with faithfulness ourselves.

24
00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:09.335
In other words, what changes for us

25
00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:13.455
because of his faithfulness in our lives?

26
00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:16.255
Well, go ahead and take your copy of God's word.

27
00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:19.695
Turn with me to one Corinthians chapter 16.

28
00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:23.775
Now one Corinthians 16, the end

29
00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:26.935
of Paul's first letter to that church.

30
00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.385
Many letters went like this,

31
00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:33.265
that at the end they would put all these greetings

32
00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:35.025
and thanksgivings in there for the people

33
00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:36.505
that they were writing to.

34
00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:38.705
And, and in the middle of all of

35
00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:40.585
that they would sometimes insert

36
00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:42.785
a quick summary of the letter.

37
00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:46.265
And that's what this is. We'll see it here.

38
00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:49.905
One Corinthians 16 verses 13 and 14.

39
00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:59.675
Be watchful. Stand firm in the faith.

40
00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:04.835
Act like men. Be strong.

41
00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:09.355
Let all that you do be done in

42
00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:12.425
love, God help us.

43
00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:16.305
Two short verses, but so much here.

44
00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:20.985
Holy Spirit, speak through your word today.

45
00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:23.185
Speak to our hearts.

46
00:02:23.245 --> 00:02:27.905
May we be good soil ready to receive this good word,

47
00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:29.545
your gospel planted

48
00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:34.545
and that you would bear fruit a hundredfold in our lives

49
00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:39.145
to be doers, not just hearers of this word today.

50
00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:42.865
You've gotta work in our hearts so we won't hear it.

51
00:02:44.275 --> 00:02:48.975
So do it for your glory. Our good. In Jesus' name. Amen.

52
00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:53.735
Now I know students, you're almost done with school

53
00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:55.215
for the year, so you don't want me

54
00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:57.335
to add any more onto it, of course.

55
00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:01.685
But we need to do a quick grammar study of this passage

56
00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:03.965
because it's gonna help us frame the rest

57
00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:05.645
of this time together.

58
00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:07.925
It's really, really important for us.

59
00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:12.165
So look again at verse 13 as four commands right there.

60
00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:13.645
You see those rapid fire one

61
00:03:13.645 --> 00:03:15.805
after another seeming really quick.

62
00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:19.685
But in language there is a thing called voice.

63
00:03:20.905 --> 00:03:23.565
Not just that we're speaking, but it's referring to active

64
00:03:23.825 --> 00:03:25.965
or middle or passive voice,

65
00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:28.245
especially in the language this was

66
00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:29.485
originally written in in Greek.

67
00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:32.885
And so active means you are doing the action.

68
00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:36.965
Middle means you're kind of doing it with you to yourself.

69
00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:40.005
And passive means it's being done to you.

70
00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:42.995
And that's really important here

71
00:03:42.995 --> 00:03:44.235
because when you read this in English,

72
00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:48.755
it sure seems like it's all just really forceful means.

73
00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:52.635
Go stand firm, be stand alert, be strong.

74
00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:56.235
It's, it's like this action of a general to his troops.

75
00:03:57.985 --> 00:04:00.645
Almost a locker room speech, right? Kind of drum it up.

76
00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:03.285
Let's get going as we run out the field, we're ready.

77
00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:07.775
But we need to know the voices of each one of these

78
00:04:08.305 --> 00:04:10.215
words here in the original language.

79
00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:12.095
And so let's work through these four.

80
00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:17.295
Be watchful is a present active verb.

81
00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:22.615
It means you are to stay alert in an ongoing continual way.

82
00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:28.065
Not just once, but ongoing. Then stand firm is also present.

83
00:04:28.065 --> 00:04:31.985
Active means you need to remain constantly steadfast.

84
00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:35.355
Well come back to all these here in a moment.

85
00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:37.515
Act like men is present, middle.

86
00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:41.675
Remember that's kind of this, putting it on consistently

87
00:04:41.955 --> 00:04:43.955
yourself, almost like a robe wrapping it on.

88
00:04:45.015 --> 00:04:48.685
But the fourth one, be strong

89
00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:53.735
is a passive verb.

90
00:04:54.325 --> 00:04:58.775
It's present. Passive means you're constantly receiving it.

91
00:05:00.615 --> 00:05:04.465
It's still an imperative, which means it's a command

92
00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:08.545
to continually be receiving strength.

93
00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:12.755
Well, strength from whom? Well,

94
00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:14.475
that's not just strength from some

95
00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:15.955
outside source here on earth.

96
00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:16.995
It's strength from the Lord.

97
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.835
It's from his faithfulness to us

98
00:05:19.835 --> 00:05:21.755
that we've seen the whole series.

99
00:05:24.105 --> 00:05:27.685
So be strengthened is the command.

100
00:05:30.155 --> 00:05:31.445
Well, we take these four words

101
00:05:31.445 --> 00:05:34.885
and what that means for us today then is

102
00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:37.405
that God's strength enables us

103
00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:42.515
to fight God's strength.

104
00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:44.955
So we're taking these four as a group.

105
00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:50.015
God's strength enables us the ability

106
00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:56.085
to fight grants it to us, right?

107
00:05:56.085 --> 00:05:57.325
It's the fourth of the four,

108
00:05:57.385 --> 00:05:59.165
but it's really important 'cause it's passive.

109
00:05:59.505 --> 00:06:00.965
So you're receiving the strength

110
00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:03.085
to even do the other things.

111
00:06:03.185 --> 00:06:05.605
So we can fight in this battle.

112
00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:07.125
Now what battle am I talking about?

113
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.605
Well, it's the battle that Paul wrote against the entire

114
00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:13.805
letter of one Corinthians,

115
00:06:15.985 --> 00:06:18.795
that the Corinthians were tempted to side

116
00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:22.475
with worldly truths rather than the the gospel.

117
00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:25.675
Eternal truths. That's a battle, right?

118
00:06:27.935 --> 00:06:29.235
The Corinthians were tempted

119
00:06:29.235 --> 00:06:31.995
to divide within the church over leaders

120
00:06:32.295 --> 00:06:33.955
or other things within the church.

121
00:06:33.955 --> 00:06:37.155
That's a fight to overcome that temptation.

122
00:06:40.135 --> 00:06:42.435
The Corinthians were tempted every day towards sexual

123
00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.675
immorality and lawsuits and idolatry

124
00:06:45.775 --> 00:06:47.595
and greed and gluttony.

125
00:06:48.765 --> 00:06:50.395
Those are spiritual battles.

126
00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:55.895
Listen, if you, and I think that coming

127
00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.015
to Christ makes things easy.

128
00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:02.535
We are way wrong in that thought

129
00:07:04.905 --> 00:07:06.715
that our lives will be free from hardship.

130
00:07:06.975 --> 00:07:08.755
That's kind of how it's sold at times, right?

131
00:07:08.755 --> 00:07:11.515
Come to Jesus, all your problems go away. No, we're wrong.

132
00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:15.555
The enemy comes after us when we follow Christ.

133
00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:20.075
And so we need to rest in

134
00:07:20.455 --> 00:07:25.435
and receive God's strength in order to fight well.

135
00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:29.865
And so those other three commands

136
00:07:29.865 --> 00:07:31.665
that fourth one's passive receive the strength.

137
00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:34.745
The three commands before that give us the active ways

138
00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:38.545
that we do fight in this battle of life.

139
00:07:39.445 --> 00:07:41.585
The demeanor we have, you might say,

140
00:07:41.765 --> 00:07:44.185
as we fight this battle.

141
00:07:44.845 --> 00:07:47.265
So look again, it says first with alertness.

142
00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:52.105
That's the first command he gives in verse 13, be watchful.

143
00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:57.925
So fight with alertness in God's strength. Be watchful.

144
00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:02.445
Constant readiness on the alert for a threat.

145
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:08.045
In fact, this is one of the common words Jesus used himself

146
00:08:08.585 --> 00:08:12.205
in the parables he gave regarding the soon coming

147
00:08:12.885 --> 00:08:14.205
judgment at the end of time.

148
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.265
And the way he said it was like, you know, if you knew,

149
00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:26.025
if you knew that a thief was coming to break into your house

150
00:08:26.055 --> 00:08:27.865
between two and 4:00 AM

151
00:08:29.255 --> 00:08:30.845
you'd stay awake for that, wouldn't you?

152
00:08:30.895 --> 00:08:32.325
Right? You would, you would.

153
00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:34.205
You would stay alert if you're like, okay,

154
00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:36.805
they told you they're coming so you would stay awake.

155
00:08:36.865 --> 00:08:38.965
You would stay alert. That's the image.

156
00:08:38.965 --> 00:08:40.605
Jesus paints with those parables.

157
00:08:40.605 --> 00:08:44.005
Like if you know the robber's coming, you stay alert.

158
00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.155
It's also the word that Jesus used

159
00:08:47.435 --> 00:08:49.315
whenever he was in the garden with his disciples

160
00:08:49.315 --> 00:08:50.635
before he was crucified.

161
00:08:52.455 --> 00:08:55.685
And he said, come pray with me. But he said, remain here.

162
00:08:55.905 --> 00:09:00.645
And the word he used was, watch with me. It's the same word.

163
00:09:00.715 --> 00:09:02.645
It's stay awake is what he was saying.

164
00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:05.295
Which if you know the story, they didn't

165
00:09:06.215 --> 00:09:08.015
multiple times stay awake.

166
00:09:10.215 --> 00:09:13.635
And so the idea here is that in God's strength,

167
00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:16.945
in light of everything

168
00:09:16.945 --> 00:09:19.585
that was coming at the Corinthians in their world,

169
00:09:20.135 --> 00:09:21.465
they were to be watchful.

170
00:09:21.575 --> 00:09:24.585
They were to stay alert at their posts.

171
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:29.715
They needed to stay guarded against the corrupting

172
00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:32.355
influences in Corinth.

173
00:09:34.715 --> 00:09:36.065
Jesus, in fact, in the garden.

174
00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:37.905
He said it a little differently another time.

175
00:09:38.845 --> 00:09:41.585
He said, watch again the same word, watch

176
00:09:41.805 --> 00:09:45.105
and pray that you may not enter into temptation.

177
00:09:46.325 --> 00:09:49.505
For the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

178
00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:55.365
Meaning you gotta stay diligent, stay on the ball, stay

179
00:09:55.935 --> 00:10:00.625
alert against the corrupting influences,

180
00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:01.785
the sinful temptations.

181
00:10:01.805 --> 00:10:05.265
But they also needed to be alert, watchful

182
00:10:05.565 --> 00:10:08.705
for the bad theology that was floating all

183
00:10:08.725 --> 00:10:11.345
around them in Corinth, tempting them

184
00:10:11.345 --> 00:10:14.545
to doubt the gospel truths that they knew and cherished.

185
00:10:17.755 --> 00:10:22.705
Well think about that. Are those things not the same

186
00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.265
kind of things that we need to be alert for?

187
00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:29.785
It's not just in Corinth, it's in Edmond, it's in America.

188
00:10:31.785 --> 00:10:36.275
Like don't we just as much tend to drift along

189
00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:40.825
with the currents of the world just like they did tempted

190
00:10:40.825 --> 00:10:43.305
to fall into the same traps that they did,

191
00:10:43.305 --> 00:10:45.625
where we fall into sexual immorality

192
00:10:45.685 --> 00:10:49.605
as anyone else in the world where we are tempted

193
00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:53.005
to live, greedy self-centered lives just like

194
00:10:53.065 --> 00:10:54.445
any unbeliever would.

195
00:10:56.245 --> 00:11:00.085
It's right here where we can be tempted

196
00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:01.485
to judge each other

197
00:11:01.665 --> 00:11:05.725
and to treat each other based on social status rather than

198
00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:07.805
shared status in Jesus Christ.

199
00:11:07.825 --> 00:11:12.525
As brothers and sisters we're tempted with the same things.

200
00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:16.935
It's like the frog. You've heard this analogy.

201
00:11:17.035 --> 00:11:20.135
The frog in the the kettle, the pot on the stove, right?

202
00:11:22.175 --> 00:11:24.875
You can very slowly turn the heat up on

203
00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:25.915
the frog in the water.

204
00:11:26.055 --> 00:11:29.475
He won't even notice. You know why?

205
00:11:30.705 --> 00:11:33.275
Because he's a cold-blooded animal.

206
00:11:34.615 --> 00:11:36.385
What that means is not his

207
00:11:36.925 --> 00:11:38.865
spirit has anything that he's cold-blooded.

208
00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:43.105
No he, he's cold-blooded means he, he adapts

209
00:11:43.485 --> 00:11:44.625
to his environment.

210
00:11:47.065 --> 00:11:49.845
We might say he accommodates

211
00:11:51.725 --> 00:11:56.405
fits in to the environment in

212
00:11:56.405 --> 00:11:57.845
which he is.

213
00:12:00.255 --> 00:12:04.045
Let's not be the frog church. Let's not be the frog.

214
00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:10.855
We need to be watchful for the rising temperature

215
00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:15.455
of temptations to sin that are coming all around us

216
00:12:17.045 --> 00:12:19.625
for the rising temperature of bad theology

217
00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:22.465
that is just being saturated all over social

218
00:12:22.465 --> 00:12:23.785
media, all over tv.

219
00:12:25.275 --> 00:12:27.975
Not just coming from those false teachers,

220
00:12:28.035 --> 00:12:29.215
but even coming from news.

221
00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:30.695
So-called news stations,

222
00:12:36.025 --> 00:12:38.325
the pull of the culture to just fit in,

223
00:12:39.545 --> 00:12:40.965
to be just like everyone else.

224
00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:42.325
That is this.

225
00:12:42.785 --> 00:12:47.365
Be watchful, be alert to things that will grieve God,

226
00:12:48.385 --> 00:12:50.125
to things that his word says, grieve.

227
00:12:50.185 --> 00:12:51.685
And and in his strength,

228
00:12:52.465 --> 00:12:55.205
his strength, we avoid them.

229
00:12:56.545 --> 00:12:59.885
That's what it means to be watchful, to be with alertness,

230
00:12:59.905 --> 00:13:02.165
to fight with alertness.

231
00:13:02.225 --> 00:13:04.805
And that's actually the next imperative here.

232
00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:09.005
In light of that stand firm, in the faith

233
00:13:10.825 --> 00:13:13.895
stand firm, in the faith that God's strength

234
00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:19.375
grants us the ability to fight with steadfastness,

235
00:13:21.745 --> 00:13:24.315
with steadfast faith.

236
00:13:25.585 --> 00:13:28.075
That phrase means to be firmly committed

237
00:13:29.505 --> 00:13:31.005
in conviction and belief.

238
00:13:31.075 --> 00:13:35.485
Here he says steadfast stand firm in the faith.

239
00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:40.995
Now notice what he says. Not just stand firm in faith.

240
00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:45.035
Stand firm in the faith.

241
00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:50.995
That's the Jude one, three faith that was once

242
00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:53.355
for all delivered to the saints.

243
00:13:53.355 --> 00:13:55.195
That's the same faith that Peter, Paul,

244
00:13:55.265 --> 00:13:57.115
John had in the early church.

245
00:13:57.115 --> 00:14:00.555
That's the same faith we have that's based on the gospel.

246
00:14:01.255 --> 00:14:03.675
His word. He's not talking about

247
00:14:04.445 --> 00:14:06.395
stand firm in your personal faith

248
00:14:06.395 --> 00:14:08.515
because man, I know myself that's pretty shaky.

249
00:14:10.345 --> 00:14:12.565
It waivers based on how my day goes.

250
00:14:13.825 --> 00:14:15.805
So if I stand firm in my faith, man,

251
00:14:15.865 --> 00:14:17.325
I'm gonna be all over the map.

252
00:14:17.545 --> 00:14:21.245
He says, stand firm in the faith, the gospel,

253
00:14:22.305 --> 00:14:25.565
his word in Christ.

254
00:14:27.155 --> 00:14:28.615
And that's the reason you can stand faith.

255
00:14:28.615 --> 00:14:32.375
That's the reason I can stand firm in the faith,

256
00:14:32.685 --> 00:14:35.935
because it's trustworthy, it's solid, it's based on someone

257
00:14:36.355 --> 00:14:38.975
and something that is historically

258
00:14:39.235 --> 00:14:43.065
and reasonable in its accuracy

259
00:14:45.325 --> 00:14:48.975
that God has done this for us in Christ, the core doctrines

260
00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:50.175
of Christianity.

261
00:14:50.485 --> 00:14:54.405
It's, it's true and it's right and it's solid.

262
00:14:55.565 --> 00:14:58.335
That means even in the face of opposition, even in the face

263
00:14:58.335 --> 00:15:00.295
of temptation, even in the face of

264
00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:04.495
what Ephesians four describes as every wind of doctrine,

265
00:15:04.865 --> 00:15:09.175
human cunning, deceitful schemes, the enemy bringing out us,

266
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:13.255
even in the face of the waves of that just hammering,

267
00:15:13.725 --> 00:15:15.015
hammering on the rock.

268
00:15:16.325 --> 00:15:19.385
It's solid. It's solid.

269
00:15:21.335 --> 00:15:23.185
Well, the battle's no different for us today,

270
00:15:23.185 --> 00:15:25.945
church as to what they were feeling.

271
00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:28.185
That's way he right this stand firm in the faith.

272
00:15:28.215 --> 00:15:29.505
It's no different for us.

273
00:15:29.685 --> 00:15:31.345
We are faced today with criticism

274
00:15:31.885 --> 00:15:34.025
for our faith from every angle.

275
00:15:36.845 --> 00:15:40.265
We are tempted every day to water down what we believe.

276
00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:48.575
That's why just as much we must stand firm in the faith just

277
00:15:48.595 --> 00:15:50.975
as much as they did back then in Corinth

278
00:15:50.975 --> 00:15:54.455
because the enemy is gonna constantly try to chip away

279
00:15:57.145 --> 00:15:58.845
at the exclusivity of Christ

280
00:16:02.505 --> 00:16:06.525
at the uh, he, he's gonna tempt us to believe like

281
00:16:07.395 --> 00:16:09.045
well surely everybody gets in right?

282
00:16:09.925 --> 00:16:11.365
I mean God is love.

283
00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:15.965
So isn't this universal

284
00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:22.245
or even a lesser extent to what we call inclu inclusivism?

285
00:16:22.265 --> 00:16:23.765
That's a hard word to say. Try it.

286
00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:29.725
I inclusivism that means anyone who's genuine about seeking

287
00:16:29.735 --> 00:16:31.765
after whoever God that they're seeking

288
00:16:31.815 --> 00:16:36.045
after surely God gives them salvation too, right?

289
00:16:38.405 --> 00:16:40.545
And the enemy just tosses those thoughts

290
00:16:40.645 --> 00:16:43.065
and those little things into the world

291
00:16:43.845 --> 00:16:48.345
and it starts to, to lodge into our minds that maybe we,

292
00:16:48.485 --> 00:16:51.745
we really don't have the truth.

293
00:16:52.635 --> 00:16:54.265
Maybe those things do sound right.

294
00:16:54.265 --> 00:16:55.345
Maybe those things are right.

295
00:16:57.855 --> 00:17:00.075
We have to stand firm in the faith.

296
00:17:00.215 --> 00:17:02.915
Not only that the world will mock us

297
00:17:03.535 --> 00:17:08.475
for rejecting the fleeting pleasures of sin so that we can

298
00:17:09.815 --> 00:17:12.825
please our God so

299
00:17:12.825 --> 00:17:14.825
that we can please him

300
00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:17.845
and get made fun of mocked.

301
00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:22.435
That's why we must stand firm in the faith.

302
00:17:23.635 --> 00:17:26.115
I love how one author described, uh,

303
00:17:26.455 --> 00:17:29.035
you might know the armor of God from Ephesians six.

304
00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:32.795
There's, there's shoes if you didn't know that.

305
00:17:32.795 --> 00:17:34.435
There's shoes in the armor of God.

306
00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:36.795
Here's how one author described it.

307
00:17:36.795 --> 00:17:40.795
Listen to verse 15 of Ephesians six.

308
00:17:41.975 --> 00:17:44.035
It says as shoes for your feet.

309
00:17:44.035 --> 00:17:45.315
This is the armor of God, shoes

310
00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.795
for your feet having put on the readiness given

311
00:17:47.895 --> 00:17:50.245
by the gospel of peace

312
00:17:51.555 --> 00:17:53.485
that you've put on these kinds of shoes.

313
00:17:53.585 --> 00:17:55.205
Now he's probably looking at a Roman

314
00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:56.365
soldier as he's writing this.

315
00:17:56.365 --> 00:17:58.005
And so a Roman soldier's shoes,

316
00:17:58.615 --> 00:18:03.205
their sandals were low cut boots, boot like sandals

317
00:18:03.205 --> 00:18:04.645
with straps that held them on kind

318
00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:06.605
of going up the shin a little bit like that.

319
00:18:06.605 --> 00:18:09.005
And fact, I saw some of you wearing them this morning.

320
00:18:09.105 --> 00:18:11.685
Uh, it was interesting, uh, walking around today.

321
00:18:11.705 --> 00:18:16.205
Anyway, um, but the souls on those sandals were thick

322
00:18:16.315 --> 00:18:20.605
leather and they actually had short nails on the bottom

323
00:18:20.785 --> 00:18:22.165
of them for grip.

324
00:18:22.165 --> 00:18:24.565
They were almost like cleats if you've played sports right?

325
00:18:26.945 --> 00:18:28.255
Those were not meant for running.

326
00:18:29.995 --> 00:18:33.805
What they were meant for was for the soldier to dig in

327
00:18:34.185 --> 00:18:36.885
and stand against the enemy

328
00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:39.525
because all of the armor

329
00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:41.405
of God is defensive apart

330
00:18:41.405 --> 00:18:42.565
from the sword, which you could even argue.

331
00:18:42.585 --> 00:18:44.125
The sword is defensive. It's kind

332
00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:46.285
of just impaling the enemy, impales himself.

333
00:18:46.345 --> 00:18:50.795
But, but the idea of all of it's defensive, even the shoes

334
00:18:53.055 --> 00:18:54.945
that a soldier might get pushed.

335
00:18:57.085 --> 00:19:01.945
But the goal is to stand, not slide as you're pushed

336
00:19:05.695 --> 00:19:07.645
stand firm in the faith, right?

337
00:19:11.435 --> 00:19:15.335
We are able to fight this battle of life

338
00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.615
with steady feet

339
00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:20.935
because of God's faithfulness to us in the gospel.

340
00:19:21.075 --> 00:19:23.095
Notice that, right? The shoes

341
00:19:23.155 --> 00:19:25.495
or the gospel, the readiness, the gospel of peace.

342
00:19:25.595 --> 00:19:27.495
You're standing firm in the gospel.

343
00:19:27.955 --> 00:19:30.295
Christ took the place of sinners like you and me.

344
00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:33.825
I can stand on that. And as the enemy pushes,

345
00:19:34.405 --> 00:19:38.335
the world pushes, we can stand fast.

346
00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:42.725
But that takes courage, doesn't it?

347
00:19:44.895 --> 00:19:49.835
It takes courage to stand firm in the faith when the

348
00:19:49.835 --> 00:19:50.955
enemy comes at us.

349
00:19:52.415 --> 00:19:56.115
It takes constant courage to fight in God's strength,

350
00:19:56.255 --> 00:20:00.035
to stand firm, to not shrink, to not slide.

351
00:20:00.455 --> 00:20:01.475
It takes courage,

352
00:20:04.015 --> 00:20:06.565
which is the third command here in this verse,

353
00:20:06.565 --> 00:20:09.445
which is translated in the ESV act like men

354
00:20:11.165 --> 00:20:14.225
to play the man as some would translate it.

355
00:20:14.495 --> 00:20:16.545
King James says, quit you like men.

356
00:20:16.705 --> 00:20:17.985
I have no idea what that even means.

357
00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:20.145
Uh, but that's what it says it.

358
00:20:21.885 --> 00:20:23.825
The essence of that word is conduct

359
00:20:23.935 --> 00:20:25.425
oneself in a courageous way.

360
00:20:27.845 --> 00:20:29.425
Now, what Paul was not doing here,

361
00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:30.665
'cause it sure sounds like it,

362
00:20:30.685 --> 00:20:33.905
but it, he wasn't contrasting anything about

363
00:20:34.305 --> 00:20:35.825
masculinity or femininity.

364
00:20:35.825 --> 00:20:40.505
That's not what he's doing. He's merely using a common word

365
00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:42.185
at the time that was used in a whole lot

366
00:20:42.185 --> 00:20:45.105
of different context to contrast

367
00:20:46.175 --> 00:20:49.245
full groundness with child likeness,

368
00:20:52.105 --> 00:20:54.555
manhood with being a child.

369
00:20:57.265 --> 00:20:58.435
Because think back to

370
00:20:58.435 --> 00:21:00.755
what he said just a few chapters earlier.

371
00:21:02.785 --> 00:21:04.915
This is one Corinthians 1311.

372
00:21:05.455 --> 00:21:08.915
He says, when I was a child, I spoke like a child.

373
00:21:09.515 --> 00:21:12.035
I thought like a child. I reasoned like a child.

374
00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:16.715
When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.

375
00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:21.085
See, that's what he's getting to here.

376
00:21:21.105 --> 00:21:23.205
In other words, what he's saying there is when I matured,

377
00:21:24.625 --> 00:21:28.655
when I grew up, I put away childish things.

378
00:21:31.075 --> 00:21:35.215
So what he meant here in one Corinthians 16 was,

379
00:21:35.215 --> 00:21:39.705
whether you're a man or a woman, he's not saying we all need

380
00:21:39.705 --> 00:21:40.985
to act like men.

381
00:21:41.005 --> 00:21:42.385
The call here was to grow up.

382
00:21:43.955 --> 00:21:46.775
The call here was to mature, to act like an adult.

383
00:21:46.995 --> 00:21:50.735
And an adult is courageous by definition.

384
00:21:53.665 --> 00:21:56.355
This is not talking about some worldly definition

385
00:21:56.355 --> 00:21:59.075
of manliness, like MMA fighting

386
00:21:59.175 --> 00:22:00.955
or not crying ever in your life.

387
00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:02.675
Like that's not what he's saying anything.

388
00:22:03.305 --> 00:22:05.195
He's talking about gospel courage.

389
00:22:08.855 --> 00:22:11.495
'cause think of Lydia in Philippi.

390
00:22:11.515 --> 00:22:14.415
She hosted a church in her house that was risky

391
00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:18.015
in a context like she was in.

392
00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:19.895
It was risky, but she did it.

393
00:22:21.725 --> 00:22:24.425
And then you think of Paul, his example over

394
00:22:24.525 --> 00:22:28.305
and over where he's not strong man competition.

395
00:22:28.535 --> 00:22:31.145
He's, he's preaching boldly in the face

396
00:22:31.145 --> 00:22:32.985
of opposition and persecution.

397
00:22:34.325 --> 00:22:39.285
That's courage, that's manliness in his context.

398
00:22:39.465 --> 00:22:42.685
So to be courageous is to faithfully

399
00:22:43.615 --> 00:22:46.645
carry out one's responsibilities even in the face

400
00:22:46.645 --> 00:22:49.925
of opposition, even in the face of extreme danger.

401
00:22:50.195 --> 00:22:52.325
Even in the face of frightening circumstances.

402
00:22:52.785 --> 00:22:54.805
You do what you're supposed to do.

403
00:22:57.895 --> 00:23:00.675
You don't give into fear, you don't give into hopelessness.

404
00:23:03.995 --> 00:23:06.735
Listen, following Christ is not for cowards.

405
00:23:10.835 --> 00:23:12.815
And I'm not talking just back in the first century

406
00:23:12.815 --> 00:23:15.255
because there are more Christians being martyred

407
00:23:15.475 --> 00:23:17.695
and imprisoned today than there

408
00:23:17.695 --> 00:23:18.855
were back in the first century.

409
00:23:23.105 --> 00:23:24.485
So yes, that's part of this.

410
00:23:26.645 --> 00:23:29.745
But even every day you

411
00:23:29.745 --> 00:23:34.145
and I are faced with this, this situation

412
00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:37.385
or this moment or this conversation in which courage is

413
00:23:37.385 --> 00:23:40.665
needed to stand firm in the faith

414
00:23:43.905 --> 00:23:48.045
to do the right thing when the wrong thing means you would

415
00:23:48.045 --> 00:23:52.825
get a bonus at work, takes courage

416
00:23:55.215 --> 00:23:59.875
to boldly speak up whenever everyone else is doing something

417
00:23:59.875 --> 00:24:02.075
and they start mocking you for not doing it.

418
00:24:02.295 --> 00:24:06.495
And you speak up as to why takes courage

419
00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:11.395
to care for the person that the rest

420
00:24:11.415 --> 00:24:13.395
of the group is over here gossiping about

421
00:24:13.395 --> 00:24:14.595
and you're caring for that person.

422
00:24:16.285 --> 00:24:17.065
It takes courage.

423
00:24:21.075 --> 00:24:23.615
And remember when we did the grammar study this,

424
00:24:23.685 --> 00:24:28.315
this one's in the middle voice, which means

425
00:24:29.615 --> 00:24:30.835
you put it on.

426
00:24:32.605 --> 00:24:36.505
So, so you receive it from the Lord like a, like a robe

427
00:24:36.505 --> 00:24:38.385
or a a coat or a jacket or something.

428
00:24:38.565 --> 00:24:40.425
You receive it from the Lord,

429
00:24:40.725 --> 00:24:42.705
but then you've gotta wrap yourself up in it.

430
00:24:45.155 --> 00:24:47.575
You've gotta take courage, you've gotta put it on.

431
00:24:47.875 --> 00:24:50.295
You can choose to apply it.

432
00:24:52.195 --> 00:24:54.055
So what we're saying here is we're not saying you

433
00:24:54.055 --> 00:24:55.175
gotta go be courageous.

434
00:24:55.235 --> 00:24:56.895
You gotta go drum it up

435
00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.295
and you gotta go like get in the mirror

436
00:24:58.315 --> 00:25:00.015
before that big pitch before the bosses

437
00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:01.775
and you start to, you know, ham, uh,

438
00:25:01.775 --> 00:25:02.815
here we go, here we go, here we go.

439
00:25:02.815 --> 00:25:04.295
I gotta go. You, you don't have to do that.

440
00:25:06.395 --> 00:25:08.295
You don't have to have the courage drummed up,

441
00:25:08.575 --> 00:25:09.895
manufactured in you.

442
00:25:10.035 --> 00:25:11.135
No god's.

443
00:25:11.575 --> 00:25:15.525
Remember, God's strength is what gives you the ability

444
00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:19.445
to then go fight with mature courage.

445
00:25:21.665 --> 00:25:23.965
He grants it to you, you wrap it up in it

446
00:25:23.965 --> 00:25:25.445
and you walk, you fight.

447
00:25:29.395 --> 00:25:31.615
And so again, church this like a general

448
00:25:31.675 --> 00:25:33.535
to his soldiers before a battle.

449
00:25:33.805 --> 00:25:38.375
This is how God's army us is to be.

450
00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:43.465
We are to fight in his strength with alertness,

451
00:25:43.815 --> 00:25:46.505
with steadfastness and with courage.

452
00:25:47.285 --> 00:25:51.105
We are to fight. 'cause remember church, we are not,

453
00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:54.865
the church is not meant to be a cruise ship where we get all

454
00:25:54.865 --> 00:25:57.065
of our needs met, we get entertained

455
00:25:57.325 --> 00:25:59.265
and we walk away too full from the buffet.

456
00:26:02.285 --> 00:26:06.095
No, the church is meant to be a battleship

457
00:26:08.445 --> 00:26:10.955
where every sailor has their assignment

458
00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:13.975
from Captain Jesus.

459
00:26:14.915 --> 00:26:16.855
And it's to go on this mission

460
00:26:17.085 --> 00:26:19.575
that he has ordered for us to go on.

461
00:26:22.695 --> 00:26:24.355
May that be what we are about here.

462
00:26:25.725 --> 00:26:27.065
But this is not a cruise ship.

463
00:26:28.275 --> 00:26:30.845
This is a battleship sending out,

464
00:26:31.145 --> 00:26:32.685
coming back, getting filled up.

465
00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:35.765
All of us have our assignment and we go on his mission.

466
00:26:40.135 --> 00:26:42.035
And so that gets me a little fired up.

467
00:26:42.035 --> 00:26:43.075
But, but here's what can happen.

468
00:26:45.825 --> 00:26:49.125
If we just sat on those punchy phrases from verse 13,

469
00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:53.115
we all kind of get motivated, get get going.

470
00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:58.425
If we just stayed in verse 13, it could turn us

471
00:26:59.885 --> 00:27:00.865
pretty harsh,

472
00:27:02.825 --> 00:27:06.595
demanding it.

473
00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:10.475
We could start to feel kind of angry, forceful,

474
00:27:10.975 --> 00:27:14.035
get this kind of courage from the world feeling

475
00:27:14.135 --> 00:27:16.035
and then we start blasting off on Facebook

476
00:27:16.055 --> 00:27:18.435
and all kinds of different things because I'm standing firm.

477
00:27:22.495 --> 00:27:25.875
That's why I believe Paul balanced it with verse 14

478
00:27:27.565 --> 00:27:29.335
because look at verse 14 again.

479
00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:34.275
Let all that you do be done

480
00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:36.955
in love.

481
00:27:40.755 --> 00:27:43.775
Now, that's not what a general would say to his troops right

482
00:27:43.775 --> 00:27:44.815
before they go into the battle, right?

483
00:27:47.445 --> 00:27:49.415
They're all out there ready to go fighting

484
00:27:49.755 --> 00:27:51.975
and about to run into the front lines, right?

485
00:27:51.975 --> 00:27:54.255
There he is. Like do it in love, right?

486
00:27:54.255 --> 00:27:55.335
Like now he wouldn't do that,

487
00:27:59.465 --> 00:28:01.085
but it is what he think about this.

488
00:28:01.265 --> 00:28:03.725
It is what his speech would be

489
00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:05.605
to his soldiers about the way they were

490
00:28:05.605 --> 00:28:06.645
to treat one another, right?

491
00:28:07.905 --> 00:28:09.825
You better love each other.

492
00:28:11.955 --> 00:28:13.335
You may not like each other all the

493
00:28:13.335 --> 00:28:15.695
time, but you're to love each other.

494
00:28:16.235 --> 00:28:20.935
That's the way you are to treat one another, to things

495
00:28:20.935 --> 00:28:22.215
that threaten the faith.

496
00:28:23.355 --> 00:28:24.615
Yes, we must fight,

497
00:28:26.845 --> 00:28:30.945
but to others, including our enemies, we are to love.

498
00:28:34.495 --> 00:28:37.075
In reality. This verse verse 14, it,

499
00:28:37.175 --> 00:28:41.515
it distills the whole letter into a single sentence

500
00:28:44.785 --> 00:28:46.715
because love was a basic

501
00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:49.195
but lacking ingredient

502
00:28:49.845 --> 00:28:51.515
among the believers in the Corinth church,

503
00:28:54.625 --> 00:28:58.225
which is again why Paul wrote chapter 13,

504
00:28:59.645 --> 00:29:00.825
the famous love chapter

505
00:29:00.825 --> 00:29:03.305
that's used at weddings all the time when it's really about

506
00:29:03.305 --> 00:29:04.585
relationships within the church.

507
00:29:08.485 --> 00:29:10.705
It works. Okay? I'm not gonna condemn you for saying it,

508
00:29:11.765 --> 00:29:12.825
but notice the context.

509
00:29:13.615 --> 00:29:15.425
It's about church relationships

510
00:29:15.445 --> 00:29:17.585
and how we work together as the church.

511
00:29:20.375 --> 00:29:22.715
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels,

512
00:29:22.715 --> 00:29:25.795
but have not love, I'm a noisy gong or a clinging symbol.

513
00:29:26.415 --> 00:29:29.395
If I have prophetic powers understand all mysteries

514
00:29:29.395 --> 00:29:31.875
and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as

515
00:29:31.875 --> 00:29:36.355
to remove mountains but have not love, I'm nothing.

516
00:29:38.495 --> 00:29:40.355
If I give away all I have

517
00:29:41.145 --> 00:29:43.525
and if I deliver up my body to be burned

518
00:29:44.145 --> 00:29:46.925
but have not love, I gain nothing.

519
00:29:49.335 --> 00:29:54.005
Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or boast.

520
00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:55.885
It is not arrogant or rude.

521
00:29:56.935 --> 00:29:58.875
It does not insist on its own way.

522
00:29:59.775 --> 00:30:02.075
It is not irritable or resentful.

523
00:30:03.055 --> 00:30:04.915
It does not rejoice at wrongdoing,

524
00:30:04.915 --> 00:30:06.595
but it rejoices with the truth.

525
00:30:08.105 --> 00:30:10.835
Love bears all things, believes all things,

526
00:30:11.245 --> 00:30:14.475
hopes all things, endures all things.

527
00:30:16.975 --> 00:30:19.795
So now faith, hope and love abide these three.

528
00:30:20.215 --> 00:30:23.275
But the greatest of these is love.

529
00:30:24.905 --> 00:30:26.235
It's in the church, right?

530
00:30:27.745 --> 00:30:29.125
But where do we get that kinda love?

531
00:30:32.065 --> 00:30:33.785
'cause that's not just sentimental feeling, right?

532
00:30:34.555 --> 00:30:36.385
Where do we get that kind of love again?

533
00:30:36.385 --> 00:30:38.745
Like everything else? We can't come up with it on our own.

534
00:30:38.885 --> 00:30:41.025
So just like we receive strength to fight,

535
00:30:41.365 --> 00:30:44.025
we receive this love from God.

536
00:30:45.295 --> 00:30:46.475
Romans five, verse five,

537
00:30:46.725 --> 00:30:49.715
God's love has been poured into our hearts

538
00:30:49.715 --> 00:30:53.635
through the Holy Spirit, like the container of your heart.

539
00:30:53.655 --> 00:30:56.395
God opened it up, poured his love all the way into it.

540
00:30:56.415 --> 00:30:58.595
And then you look at the classic lines all over one.

541
00:30:58.705 --> 00:31:02.695
John says, we know love

542
00:31:02.695 --> 00:31:06.775
because he laid down his life for us, love is from God.

543
00:31:06.775 --> 00:31:11.335
Even this says this, God is love. Wow.

544
00:31:13.755 --> 00:31:16.125
Then you have one John four 19,

545
00:31:18.425 --> 00:31:19.525
the clearest explanation

546
00:31:19.525 --> 00:31:20.565
of what we're talking about here today.

547
00:31:20.585 --> 00:31:22.885
It says this, we love

548
00:31:23.475 --> 00:31:25.805
because he first loved us.

549
00:31:28.785 --> 00:31:33.005
In other words, God's love grants us the ability to love.

550
00:31:35.765 --> 00:31:38.635
God's strength grants us the ability to fight.

551
00:31:39.525 --> 00:31:41.995
God's love grants us the ability to love

552
00:31:45.145 --> 00:31:46.325
his love for us.

553
00:31:46.765 --> 00:31:48.165
Remember, it's not just sentimental feeling

554
00:31:48.395 --> 00:31:51.525
that you can flippantly change based on circumstances.

555
00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:56.205
This is love in sending his son to the world,

556
00:31:56.345 --> 00:31:59.485
to give us life, to be the substitutionary payment

557
00:31:59.865 --> 00:32:01.005
for our sins.

558
00:32:01.225 --> 00:32:03.245
That's what love is

559
00:32:03.265 --> 00:32:06.845
and that's what compels us to then love as well,

560
00:32:09.015 --> 00:32:12.795
to love as Matthew 22, great commandment to love Him first

561
00:32:12.985 --> 00:32:16.315
with all that we are because we've been born of God,

562
00:32:16.315 --> 00:32:17.435
because we know God.

563
00:32:18.465 --> 00:32:20.325
We can't do that unless he loved us first.

564
00:32:20.505 --> 00:32:23.245
But then also not just to love him, to love others.

565
00:32:24.155 --> 00:32:26.045
Like Paul said in one Corinthians 13,

566
00:32:26.045 --> 00:32:28.525
because God's loved us in the way that he's loved us,

567
00:32:28.825 --> 00:32:30.405
we can then love others like that.

568
00:32:33.145 --> 00:32:35.405
That's what Paul said here in one Corinthians 16.

569
00:32:35.615 --> 00:32:39.665
Everything we do must be done, done in love.

570
00:32:42.535 --> 00:32:43.595
That's our motive.

571
00:32:46.175 --> 00:32:49.035
To seek the best for someone else, to

572
00:32:49.545 --> 00:32:52.675
willingly self-sacrifice for the good of someone else,

573
00:32:52.785 --> 00:32:54.115
even when they don't deserve it.

574
00:32:54.215 --> 00:32:58.795
And even when they could never pay me back. That's love.

575
00:33:01.595 --> 00:33:03.745
Think about how that changes our response to God.

576
00:33:07.145 --> 00:33:10.525
If, if he's loved us like he has our love for him,

577
00:33:10.635 --> 00:33:11.925
then is okay.

578
00:33:12.625 --> 00:33:16.845
My goal, God is to glorify you with everything that I am,

579
00:33:17.065 --> 00:33:20.445
to make your name famous, to obey you and what you say

580
00:33:20.515 --> 00:33:22.045
because you're worth it.

581
00:33:24.105 --> 00:33:26.755
Even at the cost. It's gonna cost me. You're worth it.

582
00:33:27.095 --> 00:33:29.195
And I give and I give and I give

583
00:33:29.195 --> 00:33:33.055
because I love him for loving me first.

584
00:33:36.265 --> 00:33:38.165
And then think about how it changes our response to others.

585
00:33:39.825 --> 00:33:42.485
How do we react then horizontally

586
00:33:42.755 --> 00:33:45.995
here, similar.

587
00:33:47.665 --> 00:33:50.525
If God loved us in this way, we look for ways

588
00:33:50.625 --> 00:33:51.845
to give to others.

589
00:33:52.305 --> 00:33:55.125
We look for ways to elevate other people,

590
00:33:55.545 --> 00:33:59.125
to serve them well, to make their lives better,

591
00:33:59.625 --> 00:34:02.325
to also identify sin that is hurting them.

592
00:34:03.765 --> 00:34:07.105
That's love because I want the best for you

593
00:34:09.025 --> 00:34:13.705
because you want the best for me, sin is never God's best.

594
00:34:15.855 --> 00:34:17.875
But it's not harsh, not brash.

595
00:34:18.295 --> 00:34:22.635
It is love, gentle saying, Hey, come back to him.

596
00:34:22.945 --> 00:34:27.315
Come back to him. And listen,

597
00:34:27.455 --> 00:34:30.955
if the church in Corinth had been living according

598
00:34:31.015 --> 00:34:32.715
to this principle of love,

599
00:34:34.845 --> 00:34:36.935
then they would not have gotten themselves

600
00:34:37.045 --> 00:34:38.335
into the messes that they did.

601
00:34:38.435 --> 00:34:42.105
All throughout this letter. That's

602
00:34:42.105 --> 00:34:44.345
what John Ctim said many, many years ago.

603
00:34:44.345 --> 00:34:46.785
He said, if love had not been neglected,

604
00:34:48.205 --> 00:34:50.095
then they would not have been puffed up.

605
00:34:50.885 --> 00:34:52.775
They would not have divided over leaders.

606
00:34:53.405 --> 00:34:56.095
They would not have brought lawsuits against one another.

607
00:34:56.965 --> 00:34:58.095
They would not have committed

608
00:34:58.095 --> 00:34:59.455
adultery with their father's wife.

609
00:35:00.325 --> 00:35:02.575
They would not have despised the weaker brother.

610
00:35:02.725 --> 00:35:05.695
They would not have been prideful about their own gifts.

611
00:35:06.115 --> 00:35:07.735
If they had not neglected love,

612
00:35:07.735 --> 00:35:09.175
they wouldn't have had all those problems.

613
00:35:09.315 --> 00:35:11.095
That's how critical love is

614
00:35:14.065 --> 00:35:15.115
even for us today.

615
00:35:18.985 --> 00:35:21.125
And so yes, we have to have the courage

616
00:35:22.435 --> 00:35:23.685
that we'll never retreat,

617
00:35:26.305 --> 00:35:29.485
but we also must have the love that we're never fail.

618
00:35:33.265 --> 00:35:35.285
So we're gonna worship together in a moment, church.

619
00:35:35.305 --> 00:35:37.685
But I want you to think about this as we prepare for that

620
00:35:40.155 --> 00:35:43.405
because God has loved us in this way.

621
00:35:44.825 --> 00:35:47.445
We are now granted the ability

622
00:35:47.865 --> 00:35:49.925
and the call to love him

623
00:35:50.585 --> 00:35:52.645
and to love others in that same kind of way.

624
00:35:54.805 --> 00:35:56.545
That's what a faithful life looks like.

625
00:35:56.565 --> 00:35:59.345
If you're wondering, okay God, what are, what am I doing

626
00:35:59.615 --> 00:36:01.105
that I need to be faithful in?

627
00:36:01.105 --> 00:36:03.705
How can I be faithful? It's pretty simple.

628
00:36:06.815 --> 00:36:07.985
It's terribly difficult

629
00:36:09.685 --> 00:36:11.415
because the enemy's coming at you,

630
00:36:11.675 --> 00:36:12.855
the world is coming at you.

631
00:36:12.855 --> 00:36:16.495
Your own flesh is working against you. It's simple though.

632
00:36:17.775 --> 00:36:20.265
It's not complicated. Don't overthink this.

633
00:36:21.535 --> 00:36:23.345
What does a faithful life look like?

634
00:36:26.725 --> 00:36:29.995
God's strength as he strengthens us.

635
00:36:30.625 --> 00:36:33.815
It's being alert to things that might trip us up

636
00:36:35.035 --> 00:36:38.415
and it's being courageously firm

637
00:36:39.395 --> 00:36:43.375
in the faith that we sing about and talk about

638
00:36:43.875 --> 00:36:46.335
and study about and worship

639
00:36:46.445 --> 00:36:50.415
because of that's what a faithful life looks like.

640
00:36:52.465 --> 00:36:56.895
Let's ask him to help us towards all that as we do it all in

641
00:36:57.485 --> 00:36:57.775
love.
