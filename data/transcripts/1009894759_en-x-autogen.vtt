1
00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:21.195
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:23.195
Uh, my name's John, one of the pastors here.

3
00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:24.475
Uh, it's great to see you.

4
00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:26.435
If I haven't had the pleasure meeting you yet, I'd love to.

5
00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:29.955
So come say hi. Come find me. Uh, we are glad you're here.

6
00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:31.395
Uh, whether you've been here a long time

7
00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:33.995
or just today's your first time, we're glad you're here.

8
00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:36.115
Go ahead and take your copy of God's word.

9
00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:38.155
Turn with me back to First Samuel

10
00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.315
as we continue our sermon series

11
00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:43.915
through this great book called He Shall Reign.

12
00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:47.155
The whole book of first Samuels, we're gonna walk

13
00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:48.515
through over the next few months.

14
00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:51.875
Now, as you turn to chapter four of First Samuel,

15
00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:54.955
let me warn you, we're attempting a massive task today,

16
00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:58.155
four chapters in one sermon.

17
00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:02.595
Now, I know some of you're like, wait a second,

18
00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:04.755
I didn't sign up to be here till dinner.

19
00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:07.555
Okay, so obviously I'm not gonna read every word.

20
00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:08.715
We're not gonna be able to do that.

21
00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:12.235
It's part of, of even the question I was asking like can we,

22
00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:15.315
can we really be faithful to the text with that much

23
00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.515
to take on?

24
00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:20.115
Well, the reality is this is really one

25
00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:22.355
long section in itself.

26
00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:24.755
And so if we were to break it up, it wouldn't,

27
00:01:24.775 --> 00:01:26.355
it wouldn't make sense in some ways.

28
00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:29.395
It would kind of even dilute the theological principles

29
00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:32.035
that God wants to teach us through this long section.

30
00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:34.595
And we'll see some things about him.

31
00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:36.595
Specifically, we're gonna see the theme

32
00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:40.115
of God's holiness very clearly in this today.

33
00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:45.515
God's holiness His, his set apartness and,

34
00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:48.035
and how he is sovereignly unique

35
00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:50.115
and how he deserves all the praise he deserves.

36
00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:51.395
All the worship. That's, that's

37
00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:52.515
what we're gonna see very clearly.

38
00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.795
We're also gonna see some things about us as humans

39
00:01:57.515 --> 00:02:02.195
'cause we're gonna watch Israel mistreat, God misunderstand,

40
00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:03.475
God mistreat him,

41
00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:05.395
and then we'll learn how similar we are

42
00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:07.915
in our lives even today.

43
00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:11.715
So let's pray and ask for his help. God, we need you today.

44
00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:13.675
We need you not just 'cause it's four chapters.

45
00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.355
We need you all the time, anytime, every time

46
00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:19.875
that we would see you rightly in your word,

47
00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:22.595
that you've given us the encouragement of it,

48
00:02:22.615 --> 00:02:26.155
but also the instruction and the correction of it.

49
00:02:26.155 --> 00:02:27.555
So God, do that today in our hearts.

50
00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:31.275
Help us to see it as you want us to see it

51
00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:34.475
and see ourselves as you want us to see us all in light

52
00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:36.035
of you and who you are.

53
00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:41.355
Help us, God, holy Spirit speak in Jesus' name. Amen.

54
00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:44.115
And so what we need to do first

55
00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:46.035
before we get to those four chapters actually go back

56
00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:49.635
before, uh, even the book itself, first Samuel, we,

57
00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:51.755
we go back all the way to the context

58
00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:55.315
and theme of why this was even happening at the time.

59
00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:57.835
Because at the end of the book of Judges, which is right

60
00:02:57.835 --> 00:02:59.485
before first Samuel, you'll find

61
00:02:59.955 --> 00:03:02.045
that even though Israel was in the land

62
00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:05.725
that God had promised them they were morally corrupt

63
00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:10.245
and even theologically bankrupt like the end of Judges,

64
00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:13.365
we looked at this a few years ago, end of judges is just a

65
00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:16.085
horrific scene of

66
00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:19.685
how far they had gone away from God.

67
00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:22.605
They were morally corrupt, theologically bankrupt,

68
00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:24.765
blatant sin everywhere.

69
00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:25.765
They were fighting each other.

70
00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:26.885
They weren't fighting the enemies

71
00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:28.005
they were supposed to be fighting.

72
00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:31.485
And the question was arising at the time over whether God

73
00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:33.285
would actually destroy them

74
00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:34.925
because of their covenant

75
00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:38.405
unfaithfulness that was on the table.

76
00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:40.205
There was a question about that.

77
00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:43.845
Or would someone restore Israel

78
00:03:45.235 --> 00:03:47.205
from their drift away from God?

79
00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:54.205
Enter Samuel this miraculous gift from the Lord

80
00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:57.325
who is given back to God by his faithful mother.

81
00:03:57.825 --> 00:04:01.565
Hannah and Samuel we remember was called from

82
00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:05.765
before birth to Judge Israel to be a priest for Israel,

83
00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:07.005
to be a prophet for Israel.

84
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:09.245
This is Samuel's new role yet again,

85
00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:12.085
the situation he was called from was not pretty.

86
00:04:14.265 --> 00:04:18.205
You remember Samuel's life was early on in the tabernacle

87
00:04:18.205 --> 00:04:22.085
around Eli, the faithful priest and his sons Hockney

88
00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:25.365
and Phineas who were extremely wicked,

89
00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:27.365
even publicly wicked, right?

90
00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:31.535
Everybody knew it and God was

91
00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:32.775
not okay with it.

92
00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:35.725
So you can read things in the Bible

93
00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:37.525
and you can kind of wonder was God just kind

94
00:04:37.525 --> 00:04:38.645
of like, ah, it's not a big deal.

95
00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:43.525
Well, well no actually God is offended when

96
00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:44.605
people dishonor him.

97
00:04:46.055 --> 00:04:48.945
Like this is not something we can forget about God.

98
00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:53.345
He is offended when people dishonor him.

99
00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:57.815
Again, we're kind of going back a little bit

100
00:04:57.835 --> 00:05:01.615
before chapter four, but this is what they were doing

101
00:05:01.755 --> 00:05:06.095
and God's response to this is one Samuel 2 29 and 30.

102
00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:10.415
Just as a reminder, Why do you scorn?

103
00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:13.135
This is God talking. Why do you scorn my sacrifices

104
00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:15.135
and my offerings that I commanded for my dwelling?

105
00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:17.175
Why do you honor your sons above me

106
00:05:17.195 --> 00:05:19.375
by fattening yourselves on the choices parts

107
00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:21.055
of every offering of my people, Israel,

108
00:05:22.195 --> 00:05:24.325
therefore the Lord, the God of Israel declares,

109
00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:26.645
I promise your house and the house, your father should go in

110
00:05:26.645 --> 00:05:27.645
and out before me forever.

111
00:05:28.105 --> 00:05:30.885
But now the Lord declares far be it from me.

112
00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:33.325
For those who honor me, I will honor

113
00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:36.805
and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

114
00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:39.605
So that's the problem, right?

115
00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:43.045
And then verse 33 says it this way, the only one

116
00:05:43.045 --> 00:05:45.245
of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be

117
00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:48.485
spared to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart.

118
00:05:48.665 --> 00:05:51.605
And all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword

119
00:05:51.945 --> 00:05:53.725
of men, right?

120
00:05:53.785 --> 00:05:57.685
See, God is offended when people dishonor him.

121
00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:00.165
He's not up there disinterested, kind

122
00:06:00.165 --> 00:06:01.725
of twiddling his thumbs just like, well,

123
00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:02.925
whatever you can do whatever you want.

124
00:06:03.025 --> 00:06:07.965
No, this God of justice is offended when people dishonor

125
00:06:07.965 --> 00:06:10.385
him because he's holy,

126
00:06:11.295 --> 00:06:14.265
Because He's worthy of us giving all the praise

127
00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:16.225
and all the glory and all the honor to him.

128
00:06:16.415 --> 00:06:17.585
He's worthy of praise

129
00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:21.905
and service, not dishonor and selfishness.

130
00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:28.395
And we'll see how God responds as we move into chapter four.

131
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.345
And what we come into chapter four Facing is a,

132
00:06:33.385 --> 00:06:35.145
a fast-paced narrative

133
00:06:35.455 --> 00:06:37.585
that involves the arc of the covenant.

134
00:06:38.285 --> 00:06:40.145
Now, you might have heard of it before, it's the thing

135
00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:42.625
that Indiana Jones was chasing, right?

136
00:06:42.725 --> 00:06:44.505
That's the thing we're looking for.

137
00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:46.505
But it's also, in fact, if you've been

138
00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:49.865
through our Good Friday experience, you've seen a replica

139
00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:54.545
of the arc of the covenant, as you can see right here.

140
00:06:55.735 --> 00:06:57.745
This was a box

141
00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:00.825
specifically designed by God.

142
00:07:00.885 --> 00:07:02.385
It was covered with gold.

143
00:07:02.525 --> 00:07:06.305
It was a symbol of God's presence with his people.

144
00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:11.025
And it sat within the most holy place in the tabernacle

145
00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:15.265
behind the curtain, in the eventual temple as well.

146
00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:17.985
And it was where the high priest would go in and out

147
00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:22.585
and he would meet the presence of God there at this

148
00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:24.185
in a sense altar.

149
00:07:25.805 --> 00:07:26.985
But that's the Ark of the Covenant.

150
00:07:26.985 --> 00:07:29.585
And so we're gonna see this as a main piece

151
00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:32.945
of this narrative going around the country.

152
00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:37.025
Now, as Samuel remember, Samuel was growing in his stature.

153
00:07:37.045 --> 00:07:41.345
He was growing in his prophetic figure in favor with Israel

154
00:07:41.725 --> 00:07:44.145
as he was growing in that we saw some enemies show up

155
00:07:45.405 --> 00:07:46.665
called the Philistines.

156
00:07:47.855 --> 00:07:50.905
They were to be driven out of the land,

157
00:07:53.075 --> 00:07:55.305
which is what kicks us into chapter four.

158
00:07:55.335 --> 00:07:56.785
Just look at verse one.

159
00:07:56.805 --> 00:07:58.665
It says that Israel went out

160
00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:01.305
to battle against the Philistines.

161
00:08:01.305 --> 00:08:03.145
So this is a shift in the narrative.

162
00:08:03.205 --> 00:08:06.105
Now we've seen just kinda the backstory

163
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:07.265
of the characters and figure.

164
00:08:07.325 --> 00:08:11.105
And then chapter four hits verse one, here's the battle.

165
00:08:12.895 --> 00:08:17.025
What becomes quickly clear though is that what's about

166
00:08:17.025 --> 00:08:19.345
to happen was a result

167
00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:21.905
of them not asking God what they should do.

168
00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:25.385
In fact, not listening to this man of God,

169
00:08:25.675 --> 00:08:29.505
God's chosen leader, they go out in this battle.

170
00:08:29.765 --> 00:08:32.945
In fact, they were routed pretty significantly.

171
00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:37.145
That's why we get to verse three.

172
00:08:40.675 --> 00:08:42.735
And when the people came to the camp, the elders

173
00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:45.535
of Israel said, why has the Lord defeated us today

174
00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:50.135
before the Philistines let us bring the ark of the covenant

175
00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:53.615
of the Lord here from Shiloh, that it may come among us

176
00:08:53.955 --> 00:08:56.885
and save us from the power of our enemies.

177
00:08:57.785 --> 00:08:58.925
So that was their idea.

178
00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:01.365
Okay, let's go get the ark and bring it here.

179
00:09:01.365 --> 00:09:04.485
Maybe that will help. And so they end up bringing the ark.

180
00:09:04.485 --> 00:09:06.445
In fact, Eli, the priest stays back.

181
00:09:06.635 --> 00:09:09.085
He's trembling in fear that they were doing this.

182
00:09:09.345 --> 00:09:13.605
But hti and PHUs, his sons accompanied the ark to the camp.

183
00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:18.565
Now verse five, as soon as the ark of the covenant

184
00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:20.125
of the Lord came into the camp,

185
00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:22.885
all Israel gave a mighty shout so

186
00:09:22.885 --> 00:09:24.725
that the earth resounded right?

187
00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:27.605
They were pumped up because they saw the ark come in.

188
00:09:27.705 --> 00:09:30.005
It was like this superstitious idea

189
00:09:30.005 --> 00:09:32.525
that maybe this will be the thing that helps us.

190
00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:36.335
Verses six through eight,

191
00:09:37.765 --> 00:09:39.775
when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting,

192
00:09:39.775 --> 00:09:41.615
they said, what is this great shouting in the camp

193
00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:44.015
of the Hebrews mean when they learned the arc

194
00:09:44.015 --> 00:09:45.375
of the Lord had come into the camp,

195
00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:47.895
the Philistines were afraid for, they said,

196
00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:49.855
A God has come into the camp

197
00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:52.215
and they said, woe to us

198
00:09:52.355 --> 00:09:54.055
for nothing like this has happened before.

199
00:09:54.735 --> 00:09:56.815
Woe to us who can deliver us from the power

200
00:09:56.835 --> 00:09:58.055
of these mighty gods.

201
00:09:58.225 --> 00:10:01.775
These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort

202
00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:05.045
of plague in the wilderness, Right?

203
00:10:05.045 --> 00:10:07.925
So, so even the Philistines knew God's reputation.

204
00:10:09.405 --> 00:10:13.495
Somehow they had heard about what he had done to

205
00:10:14.035 --> 00:10:15.735
the Egyptians in Exodus.

206
00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:18.415
Remember the 10 plagues splitting the the sea open

207
00:10:18.415 --> 00:10:19.575
Like they had heard about that.

208
00:10:19.595 --> 00:10:21.655
And so they didn't know who God was,

209
00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:22.735
didn't have a relationship with him,

210
00:10:22.835 --> 00:10:24.455
but they had heard what he had done before.

211
00:10:26.555 --> 00:10:27.735
So they were worried

212
00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:29.735
and they knew at this point like, all right,

213
00:10:30.185 --> 00:10:31.575
we're gonna have to fight as hard

214
00:10:31.575 --> 00:10:32.695
as we've ever fought before.

215
00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:35.135
This is something we, we've never seen this before.

216
00:10:35.145 --> 00:10:37.735
We're gonna have to come after this harder than ever

217
00:10:37.735 --> 00:10:38.935
and watch what happens next.

218
00:10:39.835 --> 00:10:40.975
Verses 10 and 11.

219
00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:47.015
And so the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated

220
00:10:48.445 --> 00:10:50.305
and they fled every man to his home.

221
00:10:50.305 --> 00:10:51.865
And there was a very great slaughter

222
00:10:51.965 --> 00:10:54.825
for 30,000 soldiers of Israel fell.

223
00:10:56.085 --> 00:11:00.945
And the arc of God was captured and the two sons of Eli Hni

224
00:11:00.945 --> 00:11:02.505
and Phineas died.

225
00:11:05.315 --> 00:11:09.695
So Israel's great plan didn't work. Let's bring the arc.

226
00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:12.255
Maybe this will be the answer and it didn't work.

227
00:11:14.795 --> 00:11:15.895
But more than that,

228
00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:20.235
the prophecy back in chapters two

229
00:11:20.235 --> 00:11:21.835
and three that God had given to Samuel

230
00:11:21.975 --> 00:11:26.635
and given to Eli came true Hoffey.

231
00:11:26.635 --> 00:11:28.275
And Phineas died by the sword.

232
00:11:28.305 --> 00:11:30.755
Even Eli himself, he keep reading in chapter four,

233
00:11:30.935 --> 00:11:34.235
Eli himself, when he heard of the tragic news of his sons

234
00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:37.035
and the arc, he fell over and died.

235
00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:41.015
It's what God had said was going to happen.

236
00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:45.035
And so that's part of it. That's bad enough.

237
00:11:45.055 --> 00:11:49.225
But worst of all, the arc of God

238
00:11:50.005 --> 00:11:51.785
had fallen into enemy hands.

239
00:11:56.065 --> 00:11:59.485
The symbol of God's presence with his people

240
00:12:01.485 --> 00:12:05.965
was now in the hands of pagans of his enemies.

241
00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:12.085
The glory had departed Israel.

242
00:12:15.685 --> 00:12:17.145
But I don't want us to miss something

243
00:12:17.325 --> 00:12:19.065
and we get lost in the story.

244
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:23.265
Don't miss what Israel had been trying to do here.

245
00:12:26.305 --> 00:12:28.315
They were completely dishonoring God.

246
00:12:29.505 --> 00:12:31.995
They were scorning his sacrifices.

247
00:12:31.995 --> 00:12:35.875
They were blatantly sinning even in the tabernacle.

248
00:12:36.815 --> 00:12:40.155
Yet at the same time, they were wanting God to honor them.

249
00:12:44.785 --> 00:12:45.795
Like you see this right?

250
00:12:46.105 --> 00:12:50.075
They trivialized God, they trivialized his worship,

251
00:12:50.575 --> 00:12:53.995
but at the same time they thought they could manipulate him

252
00:12:54.265 --> 00:12:56.515
into giving them power and victory and battle.

253
00:13:00.895 --> 00:13:01.915
You can't do it right?

254
00:13:03.175 --> 00:13:06.555
God cannot be manipulated into honoring us.

255
00:13:09.425 --> 00:13:13.875
Like this is clear right here

256
00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:18.115
that God cannot be manipulated into honoring us.

257
00:13:18.295 --> 00:13:21.795
Now we sit here two, 3000 years later, right?

258
00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:23.715
And we look back at this

259
00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:27.995
and we say, man, of course, Like it's very clear for us

260
00:13:28.055 --> 00:13:30.955
to see that from our seat here, 3000.

261
00:13:30.955 --> 00:13:31.955
Like we can see it.

262
00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:33.475
It's there like, oh boy guys,

263
00:13:33.735 --> 00:13:35.355
how did you ever think that would work?

264
00:13:38.925 --> 00:13:41.955
Don't we do the same thing all the time?

265
00:13:44.775 --> 00:13:47.145
Like, Like don't you And I do the same things

266
00:13:50.225 --> 00:13:51.755
like we make light of worship

267
00:13:53.575 --> 00:13:55.715
and then we expect God to bless it

268
00:13:56.415 --> 00:13:59.495
Or, Or

269
00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:03.015
or I like at the times I don't pray

270
00:14:04.435 --> 00:14:07.615
and then I expect God to pour his presence out on me.

271
00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:14.705
Or the times that we make life decisions completely on our

272
00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:18.225
own and then we expect God to bless them wholeheartedly.

273
00:14:18.285 --> 00:14:23.235
The or you're

274
00:14:23.355 --> 00:14:25.915
addicted to pornography and then you expect

275
00:14:25.935 --> 00:14:28.395
and assume that God's gonna protect you somehow

276
00:14:28.425 --> 00:14:31.355
because you go to church more often than most people do.

277
00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:38.025
Or you spend and spend

278
00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:40.905
and spend, yet you rarely give to anything.

279
00:14:40.925 --> 00:14:43.665
But you just know God's gonna continue to give you more.

280
00:14:47.975 --> 00:14:50.905
Like, we'll, we'll decorate our houses with crosses

281
00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:54.325
and we'll put phrases like verses in our bios.

282
00:14:54.505 --> 00:14:58.605
Yet we're shocked somehow whenever God doesn't protect

283
00:14:58.625 --> 00:15:01.845
or when our life hurts because we're living for ourself over

284
00:15:01.865 --> 00:15:03.085
and over and over in our lives.

285
00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:08.185
God is holy

286
00:15:09.105 --> 00:15:12.675
I He will not be mocked.

287
00:15:14.945 --> 00:15:18.765
God is holy and he cannot be manipulated into honoring us.

288
00:15:21.995 --> 00:15:23.845
Like if you've turned your back on him,

289
00:15:24.985 --> 00:15:27.005
do not be surprised when he allows you

290
00:15:27.005 --> 00:15:28.085
to struggle and suffer.

291
00:15:33.345 --> 00:15:34.485
But there's another truth we need

292
00:15:34.485 --> 00:15:35.525
to remember about God here.

293
00:15:37.605 --> 00:15:40.615
It's that he will be honored with or without us.

294
00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:49.205
We might not be all in. We might in fact be dishonoring him.

295
00:15:49.425 --> 00:15:53.455
He will be honored with or without us.

296
00:15:54.235 --> 00:15:56.615
God let Israel lose the battle.

297
00:16:00.365 --> 00:16:04.225
But watch what God does. Starting in chapter five. Now

298
00:16:09.405 --> 00:16:10.575
Look at verses one and two.

299
00:16:10.575 --> 00:16:13.095
When the Philistines captured the arc of God,

300
00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:15.815
they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashton.

301
00:16:16.645 --> 00:16:18.975
Then the Philistines took the Ark of God

302
00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:21.455
and brought it into the house of Dagon

303
00:16:21.515 --> 00:16:24.095
and set it up beside Dagon.

304
00:16:24.155 --> 00:16:27.495
Now, Dagon was the Philistines God that they had chosen

305
00:16:28.035 --> 00:16:29.135
to follow.

306
00:16:29.435 --> 00:16:33.615
And bringing the ark into the temple of God was

307
00:16:33.635 --> 00:16:35.495
of their God was symbolic, right?

308
00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.095
It was almost like, you know, when you see in sports

309
00:16:38.155 --> 00:16:39.535
and all these things, there's taunting

310
00:16:39.775 --> 00:16:40.935
involved a lot in sports.

311
00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:43.575
Like there's this measure of of tough ness

312
00:16:43.575 --> 00:16:45.735
that you're gonna overcome and I'm gonna taunt you

313
00:16:45.735 --> 00:16:46.935
because I just defeated you.

314
00:16:46.995 --> 00:16:48.135
That's what's happening here.

315
00:16:48.285 --> 00:16:50.535
They brought the arc into the temple of their God

316
00:16:50.555 --> 00:16:54.695
to taunt the God saying, we defeated you, we defeated you.

317
00:16:54.835 --> 00:16:57.295
You are our enemies. You're done. We won.

318
00:17:00.315 --> 00:17:02.975
Yet as the philosopher Lee Corso would say, not

319
00:17:02.975 --> 00:17:04.015
so fast my friend.

320
00:17:07.185 --> 00:17:09.795
Look at verses three and four and

321
00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:12.595
and listen, don't miss God's subtle humor here.

322
00:17:15.185 --> 00:17:17.395
When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day,

323
00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:20.675
behold Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground

324
00:17:20.735 --> 00:17:22.075
before the ark of the Lord.

325
00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:25.795
So they took Dagon, put him back in his place, kinda like,

326
00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.955
oh well maybe an earthquake or something.

327
00:17:27.955 --> 00:17:29.035
We don't know. But verse four.

328
00:17:29.175 --> 00:17:30.515
But when they rose early the next morning,

329
00:17:30.515 --> 00:17:33.315
behold Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground

330
00:17:33.315 --> 00:17:36.195
before the ark of the Lord and the head of Dagon.

331
00:17:36.215 --> 00:17:39.595
And both his hands were lying, cut off on the threshold.

332
00:17:39.595 --> 00:17:42.515
Only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.

333
00:17:43.975 --> 00:17:45.555
Pretty clear what's happening here, right?

334
00:17:46.745 --> 00:17:48.555
Like this is the picture we put up at the beginning

335
00:17:48.555 --> 00:17:49.820
of this, the series, right?

336
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.445
Like this is the idea who kept knocking over the statue.

337
00:17:52.665 --> 00:17:55.205
Was somebody slipping in the air? And no, it was God, right?

338
00:17:56.505 --> 00:17:58.445
It was God who knocked it over.

339
00:17:58.545 --> 00:18:01.485
It was God who cut off its head, cut off its hands.

340
00:18:02.845 --> 00:18:06.455
What he was doing was showing his power over any other God.

341
00:18:09.875 --> 00:18:12.855
Yet it wasn't just this statue and that whole process.

342
00:18:13.085 --> 00:18:16.015
Look at, look at verses seven, uh, six and seven here.

343
00:18:18.235 --> 00:18:21.575
The hand of the Lord was heavy against the people of Ashdod.

344
00:18:21.955 --> 00:18:23.255
And he terrified

345
00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:26.775
and afflicted them with tumors, both Ashdod and his territory.

346
00:18:26.965 --> 00:18:29.775
When the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said,

347
00:18:29.995 --> 00:18:32.895
the Ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us.

348
00:18:33.235 --> 00:18:37.895
For his hand is hard against us and against Dagon our God.

349
00:18:38.795 --> 00:18:40.735
So not only the statue itself,

350
00:18:41.035 --> 00:18:42.455
God also afflicted the people.

351
00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:47.005
Now there's an interesting word play

352
00:18:47.135 --> 00:18:48.765
throughout these chapters.

353
00:18:49.865 --> 00:18:52.445
On the word translated both honor

354
00:18:53.655 --> 00:18:55.235
and heavy or fat.

355
00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:57.235
We've seen it a number of times throughout the whole book

356
00:18:57.235 --> 00:19:00.515
already, and it intertwines both that word

357
00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:03.795
that's pretty much the same word in Hebrew honor and heavy.

358
00:19:04.095 --> 00:19:06.635
It intertwines with the hand of God.

359
00:19:06.635 --> 00:19:09.275
You'll see this show up here in a number of ways.

360
00:19:09.555 --> 00:19:14.515
'cause think about this, it it said God's hand was not

361
00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:20.065
on the heavy priest named Eli, right?

362
00:19:20.065 --> 00:19:21.225
He said he was fat, he was

363
00:19:21.235 --> 00:19:22.465
heavy, he was getting fat off them.

364
00:19:22.515 --> 00:19:26.265
Sacra, he was heavy. God's hand was not on Eli.

365
00:19:26.285 --> 00:19:28.185
But here we just saw that God's hand

366
00:19:28.725 --> 00:19:33.265
was heavy on the Philistines, even to the point

367
00:19:33.265 --> 00:19:36.865
of cutting off what from that statue, the hands

368
00:19:37.605 --> 00:19:42.445
of Dagon, all of that was to show

369
00:19:42.475 --> 00:19:45.525
that the God of Israel was to be honored

370
00:19:46.335 --> 00:19:48.045
heavy in their eyes.

371
00:19:49.465 --> 00:19:52.805
So there's this back and forth of the hand of God doing this

372
00:19:52.805 --> 00:19:55.045
and the hand of God not doing this and cutting off hands

373
00:19:55.045 --> 00:19:57.245
and heaviness and worship all of that.

374
00:19:57.555 --> 00:19:59.365
That was to show that God is worthy

375
00:20:00.225 --> 00:20:02.885
of the weight of glory.

376
00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:08.495
Well, these Philistines are panicking at this point.

377
00:20:09.515 --> 00:20:11.895
And so what they do from Ashton, they sent the ark up

378
00:20:11.895 --> 00:20:13.415
to the next city called Gath.

379
00:20:13.985 --> 00:20:16.735
We'll see Gath show up a little bit later in the narrative

380
00:20:16.835 --> 00:20:18.895
in one Samuel, but, but what we see in Gath,

381
00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:21.255
God's hand was heavy on them too.

382
00:20:21.635 --> 00:20:24.975
And we see this, it's Tuma show up there just as much

383
00:20:24.975 --> 00:20:26.295
as it did in Ash dot, right?

384
00:20:28.995 --> 00:20:30.575
And so the gas, they're freaking out

385
00:20:30.575 --> 00:20:31.655
and they see the same thing happen.

386
00:20:31.655 --> 00:20:33.335
So they're like, we gotta get this thing outta here.

387
00:20:33.475 --> 00:20:34.655
So they go up to Akron

388
00:20:34.655 --> 00:20:37.335
and they take what happens in Akron, same thing.

389
00:20:37.335 --> 00:20:39.935
Philistine city catches the tumor again

390
00:20:40.035 --> 00:20:41.655
and all of this is happening over.

391
00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:43.375
And so they were just like, we're done with this.

392
00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:45.215
And they send it off back to Israel.

393
00:20:47.795 --> 00:20:50.165
They had seen now that God is the Lord

394
00:20:50.265 --> 00:20:51.765
and there's nothing they can do about it.

395
00:20:51.765 --> 00:20:53.485
There's nothing they can prevent it.

396
00:20:53.505 --> 00:20:56.365
So they just asked his heavy hand to leave them,

397
00:21:00.275 --> 00:21:02.015
but they didn't send the ark away empty.

398
00:21:03.395 --> 00:21:06.815
In fact, they actually made a a few golden mice

399
00:21:06.815 --> 00:21:10.615
and golden tumors to accompany the ark

400
00:21:10.615 --> 00:21:12.055
as it went back to Israel.

401
00:21:12.075 --> 00:21:13.895
Now, just imagine you're on the receiving end of that.

402
00:21:15.085 --> 00:21:18.255
Like what in the world tumors, mice? Like what?

403
00:21:18.685 --> 00:21:20.815
What happened over there? Right? That's what you would get.

404
00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:25.415
But that's the idea that they were trying to atone

405
00:21:26.235 --> 00:21:28.255
in a way for their sin.

406
00:21:30.905 --> 00:21:35.605
You get into chapter six, this is verses five and six.

407
00:21:35.605 --> 00:21:36.965
The Philistines are debating this.

408
00:21:36.965 --> 00:21:39.565
They say, so you must make images of your tumors, images

409
00:21:39.565 --> 00:21:42.165
of your mice that ravage the land, give glory

410
00:21:42.165 --> 00:21:43.245
to the God of Israel.

411
00:21:43.795 --> 00:21:46.645
Perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you

412
00:21:46.645 --> 00:21:47.965
and your gods and your land.

413
00:21:48.305 --> 00:21:50.005
Why should you harden your hearts?

414
00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:53.005
As the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts

415
00:21:53.815 --> 00:21:55.605
after he dealt severely with them,

416
00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:58.285
did they not send the people away And they

417
00:21:58.325 --> 00:22:00.795
departed, right?

418
00:22:00.795 --> 00:22:04.665
They learned that when God's hand is heavy, you need

419
00:22:04.665 --> 00:22:06.745
to honor him and you need to get outta the way

420
00:22:06.965 --> 00:22:09.465
and say, okay, here you can have them back.

421
00:22:13.045 --> 00:22:15.305
So check this out. I read this in a commentary.

422
00:22:15.305 --> 00:22:19.385
This was interesting, the narrative here, it reads like

423
00:22:19.945 --> 00:22:24.465
a military campaign conducted not by a human army

424
00:22:24.465 --> 00:22:27.625
with a human commander, but by God himself.

425
00:22:29.875 --> 00:22:32.025
Check this out. See, he, he traveled.

426
00:22:32.245 --> 00:22:35.425
God traveled alone into Felicia

427
00:22:37.315 --> 00:22:39.395
invading and conquering city

428
00:22:39.645 --> 00:22:42.955
after city, executing their king Dagon,

429
00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:46.075
getting the enemy to surrender

430
00:22:46.415 --> 00:22:50.115
and then returning home triumphantly with the spoils of war.

431
00:22:52.975 --> 00:22:57.605
Humans had nothing to do with it, it was just God himself.

432
00:22:58.985 --> 00:23:00.085
But again, that's the point.

433
00:23:00.485 --> 00:23:02.365
Remember, God will be honored with

434
00:23:02.365 --> 00:23:06.625
or without us in the midst

435
00:23:06.805 --> 00:23:08.745
of human weakness and failure.

436
00:23:09.165 --> 00:23:13.425
We see God's power and we see the weight of God's glory.

437
00:23:13.695 --> 00:23:14.825
Even his own people.

438
00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:17.665
Yes, the Philistines understood it for the first time,

439
00:23:17.885 --> 00:23:20.825
but even his own people understood this more as a result

440
00:23:20.835 --> 00:23:24.585
where even at the end of chapter six, in verse 20, they say,

441
00:23:25.085 --> 00:23:27.945
who is able to stand before the Lord?

442
00:23:28.255 --> 00:23:32.475
This holy God, these same people

443
00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:34.515
who had been turning their back on God for

444
00:23:34.515 --> 00:23:35.835
so long, finally see it.

445
00:23:35.835 --> 00:23:39.515
And they're like, who can stand? Who? What is this God?

446
00:23:40.255 --> 00:23:44.045
And who can ever stand before him in his holiness?

447
00:23:47.235 --> 00:23:48.415
That's the question, isn't it?

448
00:23:51.735 --> 00:23:52.985
Like, do we ever consider that?

449
00:23:55.515 --> 00:23:59.775
Do we ever really dig deep into the seriousness

450
00:23:59.875 --> 00:24:02.855
of our sin, that it's rebellion

451
00:24:02.855 --> 00:24:04.295
against the king of the universe?

452
00:24:05.085 --> 00:24:09.185
Like, Do I let my heart open

453
00:24:09.605 --> 00:24:13.465
to the reality of the weight of God's glory?

454
00:24:16.865 --> 00:24:18.995
Like there's no way I could stay the same, right?

455
00:24:20.805 --> 00:24:24.455
There's no way you could stay the same if you allow yourself

456
00:24:24.475 --> 00:24:29.255
to really reflect on the weight of glory in God Almighty,

457
00:24:31.915 --> 00:24:33.505
which is exactly what happens next.

458
00:24:36.395 --> 00:24:38.885
Chapter seven of one, Samuel.

459
00:24:42.385 --> 00:24:44.205
See, Israel finally understood

460
00:24:44.675 --> 00:24:47.725
that it was their bankrupt theological perspective

461
00:24:47.725 --> 00:24:48.925
that got them in this mess.

462
00:24:50.305 --> 00:24:52.075
Like the reason they were having the trouble,

463
00:24:52.255 --> 00:24:53.875
the reason they were defeated was

464
00:24:53.875 --> 00:24:57.115
because of their perspective on who God wi is.

465
00:24:57.335 --> 00:25:01.835
And Samuel, their judge, their prophet, their priest,

466
00:25:01.935 --> 00:25:03.555
he was gonna lead them out of it.

467
00:25:05.975 --> 00:25:08.595
So look at first Samuel chapter seven. Look at verse three.

468
00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:14.225
And Samuel said to all the house of Israel,

469
00:25:14.685 --> 00:25:17.785
if you are returning to the Lord with all your heart,

470
00:25:18.735 --> 00:25:21.985
then put away the foreign gods and the ot.

471
00:25:21.985 --> 00:25:24.985
Those were figures of Gods that from among you

472
00:25:24.985 --> 00:25:29.065
and direct your heart to the Lord and serve Him only,

473
00:25:29.405 --> 00:25:32.225
and he will deliver you outta the hand of the Philistines.

474
00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:36.265
What'd he say? He said, repent.

475
00:25:38.085 --> 00:25:40.605
I mean, that's what he, he said, turn back to God.

476
00:25:40.865 --> 00:25:43.765
Get rid of everything else you've been trusting in.

477
00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:49.105
Serve Him Verses five and six.

478
00:25:51.335 --> 00:25:53.985
Then Samuel said, gather all Israel at mspa.

479
00:25:54.105 --> 00:25:55.505
I will pray to the Lord for you.

480
00:25:56.005 --> 00:25:58.505
So they gathered at Misbah, drew water, poured it out

481
00:25:58.505 --> 00:26:01.185
before the Lord and fasted on that day.

482
00:26:01.365 --> 00:26:04.625
And they said, there we have sinned against the Lord.

483
00:26:06.085 --> 00:26:08.865
And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Misbah.

484
00:26:08.865 --> 00:26:10.105
You see what they said, right?

485
00:26:10.105 --> 00:26:12.945
We have sinned against the Lord.

486
00:26:13.085 --> 00:26:15.705
Is that not a proper way to honor him,

487
00:26:18.025 --> 00:26:22.445
to acknowledge that he's right, you are wrong.

488
00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:26.315
That you've turned away from him, that you've been,

489
00:26:26.495 --> 00:26:28.555
you've been trusting in yourself.

490
00:26:28.895 --> 00:26:30.795
No, he's actually worthy of your obedience.

491
00:26:30.815 --> 00:26:32.635
Is that not proper obedience

492
00:26:32.935 --> 00:26:37.715
and proper worship, proper honor to just repent?

493
00:26:42.105 --> 00:26:43.535
But here's the thing about this scene.

494
00:26:44.115 --> 00:26:46.055
The threat hadn't gone away yet. Right?

495
00:26:49.145 --> 00:26:50.245
Here's, look at verse seven.

496
00:26:52.975 --> 00:26:54.945
When the Philistines heard that the people

497
00:26:54.945 --> 00:26:57.665
of Israel had gathered at Mfah, the lords

498
00:26:57.665 --> 00:27:00.505
of the Philistines went up against Israel, meaning they,

499
00:27:00.505 --> 00:27:01.825
they began to attack.

500
00:27:03.045 --> 00:27:06.225
And when the people of Israel heard of it, they were afraid

501
00:27:06.885 --> 00:27:07.905
of the Philistines.

502
00:27:07.905 --> 00:27:11.505
So, so here's the tension, right?

503
00:27:11.525 --> 00:27:14.385
We see that the question again comes back,

504
00:27:14.725 --> 00:27:16.305
had God abandoned Israel,

505
00:27:20.115 --> 00:27:22.485
were things gonna go the same way like they did before?

506
00:27:24.665 --> 00:27:25.825
Remember, they were all gathered together.

507
00:27:25.825 --> 00:27:27.385
They thought they had this thing right?

508
00:27:27.385 --> 00:27:28.505
They brought the ark with them

509
00:27:28.505 --> 00:27:30.745
and they were like, okay, God, we're gonna win now.

510
00:27:30.965 --> 00:27:32.865
And so here it comes again to fill his teeth.

511
00:27:32.865 --> 00:27:35.625
Come have they have they come back to God?

512
00:27:35.805 --> 00:27:39.665
Is he, is he truly with them? Have has he abandoned them?

513
00:27:42.635 --> 00:27:44.025
Watch this. Verse eight.

514
00:27:45.825 --> 00:27:49.285
And the people of Israel said to Samuel, do not cease

515
00:27:49.385 --> 00:27:51.965
to cry out to the Lord our God for us,

516
00:27:52.355 --> 00:27:56.005
that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines.

517
00:27:56.665 --> 00:27:59.045
Notice their immediate response is different already.

518
00:28:00.885 --> 00:28:02.775
They face the Philistines the first time. What they do?

519
00:28:02.775 --> 00:28:03.655
Well, let's fix this problem.

520
00:28:03.655 --> 00:28:04.935
Let's go get the ark and bring it back.

521
00:28:05.045 --> 00:28:07.335
This time what they do, they cried out to God

522
00:28:10.425 --> 00:28:11.485
verses nine through 11.

523
00:28:12.785 --> 00:28:14.365
So Samuel took a nursing lamb

524
00:28:14.385 --> 00:28:17.725
and offered it worshiped as a burnt offering to the Lord.

525
00:28:17.745 --> 00:28:19.885
And Samuel cried out to the Lord for Israel.

526
00:28:20.105 --> 00:28:21.685
And the Lord answered him

527
00:28:22.025 --> 00:28:24.085
as Samuel was offering the burnt offering,

528
00:28:24.265 --> 00:28:26.765
the Philistines drew near to attack Israel.

529
00:28:27.065 --> 00:28:30.205
But the Lord thundered with a mighty sound

530
00:28:30.235 --> 00:28:32.245
that day against the Philistines

531
00:28:32.245 --> 00:28:33.925
and threw them into confusion.

532
00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:36.605
And they were defeated before Israel.

533
00:28:37.705 --> 00:28:39.045
The minute of Israel went out from as

534
00:28:39.045 --> 00:28:41.365
but pursued the Philistines struck them as far as

535
00:28:41.365 --> 00:28:42.365
below Beth Carr.

536
00:28:45.035 --> 00:28:48.935
So check this out. Who actually defeated the Philistines?

537
00:28:50.965 --> 00:28:54.595
God did. Now there was some responsibility they had to take.

538
00:28:54.615 --> 00:28:56.515
Yes, kind of thing, but, but it was, God did.

539
00:28:56.875 --> 00:28:58.635
Remember who did it in verse in chapters five

540
00:28:58.635 --> 00:28:59.675
and six on his own.

541
00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:03.915
God did it. God doesn't need us.

542
00:29:05.485 --> 00:29:07.825
He defeated the Philistines on his own.

543
00:29:07.885 --> 00:29:10.785
And just like he had predicted back with Hannah,

544
00:29:11.345 --> 00:29:13.585
remember her prayer back in chapter two, verse 10,

545
00:29:13.965 --> 00:29:16.385
the adversaries of the Lord shall be broken into

546
00:29:16.385 --> 00:29:17.705
pieces against them.

547
00:29:17.845 --> 00:29:19.745
He will thunder in heaven.

548
00:29:22.075 --> 00:29:23.605
It's exactly what just happened, right?

549
00:29:25.655 --> 00:29:26.915
God won the battle

550
00:29:27.175 --> 00:29:31.405
and check out the result for Samuel seven verses 12 and 13.

551
00:29:32.155 --> 00:29:35.445
Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between MPA and Shin

552
00:29:35.445 --> 00:29:38.765
and called its name Ebenezer for he said, till now,

553
00:29:38.765 --> 00:29:40.205
the Lord has helped us.

554
00:29:41.265 --> 00:29:42.925
So the Philistines were subdued,

555
00:29:43.185 --> 00:29:45.805
did not again enter the territory of Israel.

556
00:29:46.065 --> 00:29:48.365
And the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.

557
00:29:48.585 --> 00:29:50.405
All the days of Samuel.

558
00:29:51.625 --> 00:29:53.405
It wasn't perfect peace yet,

559
00:29:54.305 --> 00:29:56.845
but the Lord had helped them.

560
00:29:57.145 --> 00:30:00.605
He responded to their cry for help.

561
00:30:01.735 --> 00:30:04.085
Which by the way, that's what that word ebenezer means.

562
00:30:04.985 --> 00:30:06.325
It has nothing to do with Scrooge.

563
00:30:06.325 --> 00:30:08.965
Don't think that way, right? Like it's, it's Ebenezer.

564
00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:11.965
The word in Hebrew means stone of help.

565
00:30:15.485 --> 00:30:19.465
It was the stone that Samuel set up as a marker

566
00:30:19.845 --> 00:30:22.945
of remembrance that, hey, God has helped us.

567
00:30:23.035 --> 00:30:24.665
Don't you remember? Like this is proof.

568
00:30:24.895 --> 00:30:27.305
This stone reminds us. God helped us here.

569
00:30:27.565 --> 00:30:29.585
God helped us here. God helped us here.

570
00:30:29.585 --> 00:30:33.665
That's why when we sing that song here, I raise my Ebenezer.

571
00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:35.705
We're not saying anything differently

572
00:30:35.705 --> 00:30:36.785
than they're saying right here.

573
00:30:36.915 --> 00:30:39.265
We're reminding ourselves that God is our help.

574
00:30:39.605 --> 00:30:41.505
God is the one who comes near to us.

575
00:30:41.845 --> 00:30:44.225
God is the one who answers our cry. He's our help.

576
00:30:44.495 --> 00:30:47.385
He's our fortress. So why should I fear anything else?

577
00:30:50.545 --> 00:30:55.325
The weight of God's glory is always heavier than anything

578
00:30:55.325 --> 00:30:57.825
else, man.

579
00:30:57.865 --> 00:30:59.745
I know life feels heavy at times, doesn't it?

580
00:31:01.345 --> 00:31:03.565
The weight of God's glory is way

581
00:31:03.565 --> 00:31:04.565
Heavier.

582
00:31:08.725 --> 00:31:09.865
But here's, here's something else.

583
00:31:09.935 --> 00:31:12.025
This section is meant to remind us of

584
00:31:12.985 --> 00:31:14.155
something really important.

585
00:31:14.155 --> 00:31:15.715
The flip side of even this in a way

586
00:31:16.465 --> 00:31:19.635
that we are blessed when we honor God.

587
00:31:21.225 --> 00:31:24.165
You remember he actually said that in chapter two, to those

588
00:31:24.165 --> 00:31:25.285
who honor me, I will honor,

589
00:31:26.665 --> 00:31:29.325
we are blessed when we honor God.

590
00:31:29.525 --> 00:31:32.245
'cause you remember the people, the priests,

591
00:31:32.355 --> 00:31:34.525
when they were living in wicked dishonor,

592
00:31:34.675 --> 00:31:36.765
they were judged severely.

593
00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:39.645
Their life was messy, their life was difficult.

594
00:31:39.645 --> 00:31:41.485
Things were really hard in life.

595
00:31:41.765 --> 00:31:43.125
Whenever they were dishonoring.

596
00:31:43.185 --> 00:31:45.805
God, when the people tried to manipulate God

597
00:31:46.225 --> 00:31:50.085
to treat his worship with corruption, yet still expect him

598
00:31:50.085 --> 00:31:51.645
to bless them, what happened?

599
00:31:51.645 --> 00:31:56.165
They were defeated. Even when the enemy,

600
00:31:56.165 --> 00:31:58.885
the Philistines tried to mock God by putting the arc

601
00:31:58.885 --> 00:32:02.605
of the covenant in the temple of Dagon, what happened?

602
00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:05.005
Plagues. His hands were cut off.

603
00:32:07.765 --> 00:32:11.365
When we dishonor, God, life hurts.

604
00:32:12.145 --> 00:32:14.805
It doesn't work right? It's painful. We are defeated.

605
00:32:15.665 --> 00:32:18.765
But when notice, remember when the people turned back

606
00:32:18.765 --> 00:32:21.765
to God in chapter seven, when they directed their hearts

607
00:32:21.765 --> 00:32:25.325
to the Lord, when they served him only what happened?

608
00:32:25.865 --> 00:32:27.045
God won the battle for them.

609
00:32:29.825 --> 00:32:33.245
Now, I'm not saying that when you turn to the Lord,

610
00:32:34.845 --> 00:32:36.445
Everything's gonna work out perfectly.

611
00:32:39.035 --> 00:32:40.085
Like you're gonna win the game.

612
00:32:40.085 --> 00:32:41.885
You're gonna get the A, you're gonna make the

613
00:32:42.145 --> 00:32:43.165
cut, you're gonna get the job.

614
00:32:43.165 --> 00:32:44.685
Like that's not what we're saying here,

615
00:32:46.005 --> 00:32:49.135
because Israel will see very quickly in the next chapter,

616
00:32:49.225 --> 00:32:50.575
still had a lot of troubles,

617
00:32:52.065 --> 00:32:54.155
even though they'd turned their hearts to God.

618
00:32:55.995 --> 00:33:00.455
But we know that God will not bless those

619
00:33:00.835 --> 00:33:01.895
who dishonor him.

620
00:33:05.185 --> 00:33:08.585
Those who try to manipulate him, those

621
00:33:08.685 --> 00:33:13.265
who stand in opposition to him, he will not bless those.

622
00:33:17.445 --> 00:33:20.145
In reality, that's all of us.

623
00:33:21.565 --> 00:33:25.865
All humans from birth are enemies of God

624
00:33:25.865 --> 00:33:26.985
because of our sin.

625
00:33:29.565 --> 00:33:32.225
And it's only like we think of how many good things we have,

626
00:33:32.245 --> 00:33:33.865
how many good things unbelievers have.

627
00:33:34.055 --> 00:33:36.785
It's only God's common grace that allows any of that

628
00:33:36.785 --> 00:33:38.185
to come into life.

629
00:33:39.885 --> 00:33:42.305
Yet, because he is so good and

630
00:33:42.305 --> 00:33:45.105
because he loves so much, he

631
00:33:45.385 --> 00:33:48.025
provided a way for even us as his enemies

632
00:33:48.085 --> 00:33:52.025
to be saved from his wrath, to receive his blessing.

633
00:33:52.205 --> 00:33:53.585
And that is through the life, death,

634
00:33:53.585 --> 00:33:55.825
and resurrection of Jesus in our place.

635
00:33:56.855 --> 00:34:01.065
Whereas we direct our hearts to him as we serve him,

636
00:34:01.325 --> 00:34:04.345
he pours out his eternal blessings on us.

637
00:34:05.025 --> 00:34:07.305
Blessings like having peace with him forever,

638
00:34:07.765 --> 00:34:08.825
and peace with each other

639
00:34:10.785 --> 00:34:12.935
where our eternity is secure

640
00:34:13.235 --> 00:34:15.535
so we can face death without any fear,

641
00:34:17.895 --> 00:34:20.365
where we know that we have a hope

642
00:34:20.545 --> 00:34:23.245
and a joy in life today, no matter what we face,

643
00:34:23.255 --> 00:34:27.445
those are his eternal blessings to his people.

644
00:34:30.275 --> 00:34:31.575
And so just think about that today,

645
00:34:34.455 --> 00:34:38.085
since he is the source of every blessing,

646
00:34:38.945 --> 00:34:43.085
how can your heart be more tuned to his today?

647
00:34:45.045 --> 00:34:49.975
Like how? How can you remove idols in your life so

648
00:34:49.975 --> 00:34:52.135
that you can return to him?

649
00:34:52.235 --> 00:34:57.215
That's the question. Today we see the

650
00:34:57.215 --> 00:34:58.295
stark contrast.

651
00:35:00.305 --> 00:35:03.155
What does God want from your heart today?
