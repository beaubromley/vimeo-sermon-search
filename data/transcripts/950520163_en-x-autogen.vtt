00:00:01.275 --> 00:00:03.605
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:06.805
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.565
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:13.925
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:17.125
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:28.325
Well, good morning, church. Morning.

7
00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:32.805
I wish, uh, you could just be up here at the front

8
00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.805
and listen to the worship this morning.

9
00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.525
You were doing amazing job of worshiping God.

10
00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:41.005
Uh, it just, it just blessed my,

11
00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:42.725
I actually forgot I was supposed to preach.

12
00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:44.725
Uh, I got caught in the moment.

13
00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:46.925
Thank you for being here this morning.

14
00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.645
I wanna invite you to open your copy of God's word

15
00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:51.245
to Psalm 65.

16
00:00:51.865 --> 00:00:54.405
My name is Perry Walker. I'm your mission's director.

17
00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:58.845
And, uh, it's such an honor this morning to be able

18
00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:02.725
to look at this beautiful psalms when we're between series

19
00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:06.245
and Pastor John preaching Many times we've been working our

20
00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:09.325
way through the Psalms, we're made our way all the way up

21
00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:10.605
to Psalm 65.

22
00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:12.685
And so that's where we're at right now.

23
00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:16.245
And so I have the honor and the blessing of teaching and,

24
00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:19.125
and sharing this morning from this beautiful Psalms.

25
00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.005
Our prayer is that just God would speak to us

26
00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:23.525
through this psalm,

27
00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:25.365
are you finding your place there in scripture?

28
00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:28.565
Amen. Beautiful Psalms,

29
00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:30.045
this morning, let me ask you a question.

30
00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:33.405
How big is your God?

31
00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:37.225
How big is your God?

32
00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:40.705
Sometimes, let's just be honest, the struggles in life,

33
00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:45.785
the distractions of life can feel so big that often

34
00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:50.905
there is a temptation to believe that God can't handle it,

35
00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:56.545
that we feel like we have big problems and a small God.

36
00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:01.145
This Psalm reminds us we have

37
00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:02.745
a big God,

38
00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:05.225
and when we get our minds wrapped around

39
00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:08.705
how big this God is, it is going to put

40
00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:11.465
your life in perspective.

41
00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:14.425
That's my prayer this morning. Amen. Amen.

42
00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:18.305
Well, this is a special time of the year. I love springtime.

43
00:02:18.775 --> 00:02:21.465
It's uh, it's just one of my favorite times of the year.

44
00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:25.625
Everything is, is coming back to life. Grass is greener.

45
00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:29.385
Trees just overnight, the leaves come out on the trees.

46
00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:30.865
The days are longer.

47
00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:34.065
What I like about summer is everybody seems nicer.

48
00:02:34.845 --> 00:02:38.185
You know, they just are, they're just nicer people and uh,

49
00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:40.985
and uh, they say thank you and please a little bit more.

50
00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:42.545
It's just a good time of the year.

51
00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:44.985
If you're a nature lover, a tree hugger.

52
00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:49.105
This is your psalms. This is, this is a psalm about nature.

53
00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:53.265
Psalm 65 is a beautiful hymn of praise

54
00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:57.825
that acknowledges God's goodness provision and, and,

55
00:02:57.885 --> 00:03:00.765
and in the particular context of nature,

56
00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:02.725
it's a psalm pinned by David.

57
00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:08.085
And, uh, it just speaks to God's provision in our life.

58
00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:11.525
It's, it is blessing God for what he has given us.

59
00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:14.885
Psalm 65, we see David here.

60
00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:17.965
He's going to talk about God's grace.

61
00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:21.325
God's might, he's going to tell us about

62
00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:24.045
God's blessings in humanity.

63
00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:28.085
This was a worship song, a worship psalm.

64
00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:31.845
It was sung many times or it could have been sung

65
00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:34.325
after a season of drought.

66
00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:38.165
And all of a sudden the rains come, but more than likely

67
00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:42.165
because of the wording in the Psalms, there is a reference

68
00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:46.485
to keeping vows to God, to worshiping God in,

69
00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:48.405
in Zion, we're gonna read that

70
00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:53.045
more than likely this Psalm was used during the Feast

71
00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:54.125
of the Tabernacles.

72
00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:58.725
That was an eight day time of celebration at the end

73
00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:00.685
of a harvest season.

74
00:04:01.465 --> 00:04:05.245
And here, the, the people would sing this hymn in their

75
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.285
worship services

76
00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:09.165
and their praise for God, for the, the harvest

77
00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:10.805
that God had bring

78
00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:14.765
because it is a, is a harvest of plentiful harvest,

79
00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:17.085
a harvest that God brings.

80
00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:21.565
It's this particular psalm, Psalm 65 is one

81
00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:25.405
of only three Psalms that have the word atone

82
00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:28.965
or atonement in it, which is the idea of atonement.

83
00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:31.765
Is God covering our sin?

84
00:04:32.065 --> 00:04:34.925
God redeeming us, God atoning for our sin.

85
00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:38.205
This Psalms, Psalms 78

86
00:04:38.305 --> 00:04:40.765
and 79 are the three only Psalms

87
00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:42.165
that have that word in them.

88
00:04:43.275 --> 00:04:46.965
This is a beautiful reminder to give God glory

89
00:04:47.785 --> 00:04:52.125
and that we can pray to God for both our spiritual

90
00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:54.285
and our physical needs.

91
00:04:54.705 --> 00:04:59.605
He is a God that meets us at the point of our needs.

92
00:05:00.025 --> 00:05:02.405
So let me just begin by reading this morning,

93
00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:06.765
and we're in Psalm 65 and we're just gonna break this up.

94
00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:09.885
The Psalm naturally is divided into three sections,

95
00:05:10.145 --> 00:05:13.005
and we're just gonna take 'em one at a time and uh,

96
00:05:13.065 --> 00:05:14.365
and work our way through them.

97
00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:19.405
So Psalm 65 verses one through four, praise is due

98
00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:23.645
to you, oh God in Zion and you shall keep

99
00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:27.205
and to you shall vows be performed.

100
00:05:27.985 --> 00:05:29.485
Oh, you who hear prayers

101
00:05:29.785 --> 00:05:33.845
to you shall all flesh come when iniquities prevail against

102
00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:36.325
you, you atone for our transgression.

103
00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:39.285
Blessed is the one you choose to bring near

104
00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:41.325
to dwell in your courts.

105
00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:46.125
We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house,

106
00:05:46.475 --> 00:05:49.445
with the holiness of your temple.

107
00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:52.725
David begins here in verse one

108
00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:55.845
and declaring that praise and

109
00:05:56.065 --> 00:05:59.845
and worship belong to the God of Zion

110
00:05:59.865 --> 00:06:03.405
and Zion being that that Jerusalem, that holy place,

111
00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:07.565
and he's talking about here to the nation of Israel,

112
00:06:07.665 --> 00:06:09.445
it speaks to the nation of Israel.

113
00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:13.005
And if all we had was verse one, we would think

114
00:06:13.115 --> 00:06:16.165
that this is the Psalms really for the Hebrews

115
00:06:16.425 --> 00:06:20.245
and for Jerusalem, but verse two expands that

116
00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:23.805
and it begins to, to, to draw our worship.

117
00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:26.445
It says that it is a worship of praise

118
00:06:26.745 --> 00:06:28.085
and it basically says

119
00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:30.445
of all people, look what it says there.

120
00:06:30.985 --> 00:06:34.405
Oh, you who hear prayer to you

121
00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:37.005
shall all flesh come.

122
00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:40.165
This psalm is an expression

123
00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:43.165
of a universal need for God.

124
00:06:44.485 --> 00:06:46.765
Wherever you are in the world, wherever your,

125
00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:50.485
wherever you were born, wherever your geography is from this

126
00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:54.285
psalm is saying, you need God.

127
00:06:54.745 --> 00:06:57.285
All peoples of the earth, not just the Jewish people,

128
00:06:57.745 --> 00:07:01.685
not just the Hebrew people, all must come to God.

129
00:07:02.745 --> 00:07:05.525
The truth is that this psalm is teaching us first

130
00:07:05.715 --> 00:07:07.725
that God hears our prayers

131
00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:13.125
and he forgives us even though we don't deserve it.

132
00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:17.925
I find great comfort in that and knowing that when I pray

133
00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:21.645
and communicate with God, he hears my prayer.

134
00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:25.125
In verse three, David describes the root

135
00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:27.365
of the problem of humanity.

136
00:07:28.065 --> 00:07:31.885
We know it is sin. Look what he says here in verse three.

137
00:07:32.555 --> 00:07:36.245
When iniquities prevail against me, you atone

138
00:07:36.745 --> 00:07:38.365
for our transgressions.

139
00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:43.165
We all are experts on the subject of sin so we understand

140
00:07:43.355 --> 00:07:44.405
what he's talking about.

141
00:07:44.775 --> 00:07:48.885
David was filling the weight of his sin, his iniquities,

142
00:07:49.065 --> 00:07:52.125
and he says it is God who atones for that.

143
00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:54.885
Notice that David didn't say that animal

144
00:07:55.445 --> 00:07:57.445
sacrifices were atoning for the sin.

145
00:07:57.595 --> 00:08:00.445
Even though there was a sacrificial system in place,

146
00:08:01.575 --> 00:08:02.805
David knew better than that.

147
00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:07.965
He knew that the blood of animals could not pay for the sin

148
00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:12.245
of humanity, and so he, he understood that.

149
00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:13.725
Notice what he says.

150
00:08:14.105 --> 00:08:15.805
He says it is God

151
00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:19.565
who is covering over the people's sin.

152
00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:22.405
Here, David is declaring later on

153
00:08:22.405 --> 00:08:25.845
what Paul would talk about in the book of Ephesians.

154
00:08:26.115 --> 00:08:28.685
Ephesians chapter two verses four through five,

155
00:08:29.265 --> 00:08:33.725
but God being rich in mercy became the

156
00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:35.765
because of his great love for us,

157
00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:39.925
which we loved us even when we were dead in our trespasses,

158
00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:44.165
made us alive together with Christ by grace,

159
00:08:44.745 --> 00:08:45.765
you have been saved.

160
00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:49.845
We're reminded here that it is God

161
00:08:50.235 --> 00:08:51.685
that brings salvation.

162
00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:54.405
It is God who covers our sin.

163
00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:59.805
That the sacrifice of animals, our efforts and our desires

164
00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:03.085
and our our, our working it out is never enough.

165
00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:06.485
It is God who atone for our sin.

166
00:09:07.325 --> 00:09:09.525
I remember as a young man when I came to Christ,

167
00:09:10.105 --> 00:09:14.325
my experience was I had chosen to follow God

168
00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:16.205
and that was true from my perspective,

169
00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:20.365
but anybody that has ever given their heart to Jesus Christ

170
00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:22.925
and become a full follower of Jesus Christ

171
00:09:22.985 --> 00:09:24.845
and surrender to him, they know

172
00:09:24.845 --> 00:09:27.605
that no sooner than you thought you had chosen,

173
00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:30.805
that you realize that God had chosen you

174
00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:32.285
and been calling you out

175
00:09:32.545 --> 00:09:35.685
and setting aside the circumstances of your life

176
00:09:36.585 --> 00:09:39.165
and you see that it is God who pursues us.

177
00:09:39.715 --> 00:09:42.365
Here we see that the people needed a savior

178
00:09:42.945 --> 00:09:46.485
and God continued to show mercy towards the people by

179
00:09:47.005 --> 00:09:48.245
covering their sin,

180
00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:52.285
but let's just be honest, to be justified

181
00:09:52.665 --> 00:09:57.285
before God, to receive his favorable treatment,

182
00:09:58.195 --> 00:09:59.445
something had to happen

183
00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:03.165
and that was the death of Jesus Christ.

184
00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:06.965
It's really not until we get to the New Testament

185
00:10:07.395 --> 00:10:11.405
that we understand how radical the grace

186
00:10:11.505 --> 00:10:13.205
of God really is.

187
00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:17.995
I love the Old Testament. I love reading the stories.

188
00:10:18.675 --> 00:10:22.355
I love reading how God is at, and I read through those pages

189
00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:24.155
and I see the grace of God in there,

190
00:10:24.255 --> 00:10:27.475
but it is when I come to the New Testament that I see

191
00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:29.555
how radical that grace is.

192
00:10:29.975 --> 00:10:34.395
It is through the death of Christ, God's perfect sacrifice.

193
00:10:34.865 --> 00:10:39.515
That atonement for our sin was made once and for all.

194
00:10:40.255 --> 00:10:41.475
We have been saved.

195
00:10:42.455 --> 00:10:45.795
We have been saved from the penalty of sin

196
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:50.195
and our sins are forgiven in Christ.

197
00:10:50.705 --> 00:10:53.665
Amen. We rest in that,

198
00:10:55.225 --> 00:10:58.085
but there is a blessing that comes from God, this,

199
00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:00.245
these are blessings that come from God.

200
00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:03.085
Not only is our sin forgiven,

201
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:06.925
but the Bible declares here in this passage in the Psalms

202
00:11:06.925 --> 00:11:09.845
that we're at that as a redeemed people

203
00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:12.925
we are brought near to God.

204
00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:14.845
Look what it says in verse four.

205
00:11:15.555 --> 00:11:17.845
Blessed is the one you choose

206
00:11:18.905 --> 00:11:21.885
and bring near to dwell in your court.

207
00:11:24.005 --> 00:11:28.725
Salvation is not just the forgiveness of my sin.

208
00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:32.335
If that's all that salvation was,

209
00:11:32.805 --> 00:11:35.375
then the moment I sin again I would be in trouble.

210
00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:38.855
Salvation is the forgiveness of our sin through the blood

211
00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:42.895
of Jesus Christ and we celebrate that we live in that,

212
00:11:43.955 --> 00:11:45.175
but it's more than that.

213
00:11:46.015 --> 00:11:50.775
Salvation actually is also a change in how God sees me,

214
00:11:52.705 --> 00:11:55.715
how I relate to God and how he relates to me.

215
00:11:56.975 --> 00:12:01.035
Now, we see in this passage that we are drawn to God.

216
00:12:01.455 --> 00:12:03.915
He changes how he sees us.

217
00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:06.715
Our relationship with God has changed

218
00:12:07.015 --> 00:12:10.035
and now as redeemed, we can live

219
00:12:10.695 --> 00:12:12.275
in his presence.

220
00:12:14.595 --> 00:12:18.485
Amen. Listen, to live in the presence

221
00:12:18.545 --> 00:12:20.685
of God is an incredible thing.

222
00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:25.005
I remember one of my first trips to the country of Haiti.

223
00:12:26.155 --> 00:12:28.405
Well, no sooner than we arrived in Port-au-Prince,

224
00:12:28.405 --> 00:12:29.845
we stopped at an orphanage

225
00:12:30.505 --> 00:12:33.645
and there at the orphanage we began to be introduced

226
00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:36.125
to some children and we began to hear their stories

227
00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:39.005
and our hearts were overwhelmed.

228
00:12:39.665 --> 00:12:44.165
We also heard how God had called this beautiful lady a

229
00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:46.485
servant of the Lord, to go and minister

230
00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:50.365
and rescue these children who had been stricken with disease

231
00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:52.245
and left for dead.

232
00:12:53.225 --> 00:12:56.325
As the children began to soak in our love

233
00:12:56.705 --> 00:13:01.485
and our presence, these children began, we began to cry

234
00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:05.125
and just watching these children, we were over Kim,

235
00:13:05.395 --> 00:13:06.685
with the goodness of God.

236
00:13:07.105 --> 00:13:09.205
We felt the presence of God.

237
00:13:09.425 --> 00:13:12.365
We felt the provision of God for these children

238
00:13:12.745 --> 00:13:14.005
and for our own lives.

239
00:13:14.185 --> 00:13:15.565
It was an incredible moment.

240
00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:19.725
While there was great need around us in that country,

241
00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:24.885
God's presence was enough in the life of these children.

242
00:13:25.565 --> 00:13:26.925
I remember praying that day

243
00:13:27.185 --> 00:13:29.325
for the team and for these children.

244
00:13:29.805 --> 00:13:33.485
I remember praying that, that God would just to thank him

245
00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:38.405
and that now I know what it means to have my cup overflow.

246
00:13:39.545 --> 00:13:41.605
Has your cup ever overflowed

247
00:13:41.605 --> 00:13:43.565
because of the presence of the Lord in your life?

248
00:13:43.945 --> 00:13:47.365
The abundance? That's what this psalms is talking about.

249
00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:51.645
Listen, God's presence is enough. Amen.

250
00:13:51.795 --> 00:13:55.605
When you're going through difficult days, we as Christians,

251
00:13:56.065 --> 00:14:00.485
we should be humble because our salvation is by grace.

252
00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:04.525
We did not earn it. The Bible says we should be holy

253
00:14:04.865 --> 00:14:09.445
and loving because our salvation is costly and yet to God

254
00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:12.005
and yet it cost us nothing.

255
00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:14.245
We should be at peace

256
00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:18.445
because the Bible says that our salvation is enough.

257
00:14:19.185 --> 00:14:20.365
It satisfies.

258
00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:22.245
We should be grateful

259
00:14:22.355 --> 00:14:26.605
because this salvation secures us a place at the table

260
00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:31.125
where we can be satisfied in the presence of God

261
00:14:31.155 --> 00:14:35.445
because God's provision is in his presence.

262
00:14:35.755 --> 00:14:40.455
Amen. I prayer, my prayer this morning for you is that

263
00:14:41.205 --> 00:14:44.215
that you this morning in the presence of God,

264
00:14:44.245 --> 00:14:45.815
that your need would be met

265
00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:48.615
and that you would experience God in his fullness

266
00:14:49.275 --> 00:14:51.805
and that would be satisfying in your life.

267
00:14:52.785 --> 00:14:54.285
We see in this passage too

268
00:14:54.425 --> 00:14:58.485
and that we are to proclaim the God of might

269
00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:03.285
in Psalm 65 verses five through eight, we read

270
00:15:03.985 --> 00:15:05.245
by awesome deeds.

271
00:15:05.245 --> 00:15:07.365
You answer us with righteousness, oh God

272
00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:11.325
and our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth

273
00:15:12.105 --> 00:15:15.365
and the furth seas, the one who

274
00:15:15.425 --> 00:15:19.085
by his strength establishes the mountains being girded

275
00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:23.725
with might so still the roaring seas, roaring of the waves,

276
00:15:23.945 --> 00:15:28.685
the ret of the people so that those who dwell in the ends

277
00:15:28.685 --> 00:15:33.125
of the earth are in all of your sights signs.

278
00:15:34.025 --> 00:15:37.685
You make the going out and the mor of the morning

279
00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:40.485
and the evening to shout for joy.

280
00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.365
This second section

281
00:15:42.705 --> 00:15:46.245
of this psalm is speaking all about the power

282
00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:50.085
and the might of this Lord, of this of God.

283
00:15:50.435 --> 00:15:53.485
This is an incredible display of the power

284
00:15:53.545 --> 00:15:55.205
of God on the earth.

285
00:15:56.385 --> 00:16:00.205
The passage itself in verse six points out two examples.

286
00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:02.325
The first being he notice what he says.

287
00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:05.005
The one who has has his

288
00:16:05.525 --> 00:16:10.125
strength establishes the mountains being girded with might.

289
00:16:10.915 --> 00:16:13.845
It's saying that God is the creator of the earth.

290
00:16:13.915 --> 00:16:15.845
He's the creator of the mountains

291
00:16:16.065 --> 00:16:18.645
and his power is on display.

292
00:16:18.905 --> 00:16:23.085
His might is on display in these beautiful mountains.

293
00:16:23.305 --> 00:16:27.125
Yes, if you've ever climbed a mountain, I had the experience

294
00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:30.965
of climbing with two of my sons in keto Ecuador one time on

295
00:16:30.965 --> 00:16:33.005
a mountain, and I'll just be honest with you,

296
00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:35.245
that mountain kicked my tail.

297
00:16:36.325 --> 00:16:38.885
I got about halfway up that mountain of about 10 hours

298
00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:41.845
of walking and my legs give out and uh,

299
00:16:41.985 --> 00:16:43.845
and I couldn't make it to the top.

300
00:16:44.185 --> 00:16:45.325
The mountain was too big.

301
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:48.285
The reality is mountain, we don't move mountains.

302
00:16:48.985 --> 00:16:50.645
We do our best just to tunnel

303
00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:52.405
through edges of the mountains.

304
00:16:52.955 --> 00:16:55.245
They are huge and they are majestic,

305
00:16:55.345 --> 00:16:57.685
and if you have ever stood on top of a mountain,

306
00:16:58.065 --> 00:17:02.605
you understand how powerful and majestic they really are.

307
00:17:03.585 --> 00:17:08.325
God has put mountains on the earth to, to remind us

308
00:17:08.345 --> 00:17:10.125
of his power and his might.

309
00:17:10.145 --> 00:17:13.765
The Bible says the second example we see here in verse

310
00:17:13.765 --> 00:17:18.045
seven, who steals the roaring sees the roaring

311
00:17:18.145 --> 00:17:19.285
of the waves.

312
00:17:20.065 --> 00:17:22.885
The waves of the ocean are fascinating when

313
00:17:22.885 --> 00:17:23.965
you consider their power.

314
00:17:24.305 --> 00:17:27.685
If you've ever went and saw the ocean or stood in the ocean

315
00:17:28.025 --> 00:17:30.525
and the waves start rolling in, you know

316
00:17:30.525 --> 00:17:32.925
that they can almost knock you down, just standing,

317
00:17:33.315 --> 00:17:34.925
just not even very deep at all.

318
00:17:34.925 --> 00:17:36.565
They are, they are powerful.

319
00:17:36.665 --> 00:17:41.125
The ocean is the o the waves can, they can take rocks

320
00:17:41.145 --> 00:17:42.605
and turn them into sand.

321
00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:45.085
They can reshape a coastline.

322
00:17:45.825 --> 00:17:48.085
The waves can take our largest ship

323
00:17:48.345 --> 00:17:50.765
and just toss it around like it's a toy.

324
00:17:51.185 --> 00:17:53.085
The here we see that.

325
00:17:54.385 --> 00:17:57.645
Why does the, the psalmist record these events of nature,

326
00:17:58.065 --> 00:17:59.805
the mountains and the roaring sea.

327
00:18:00.015 --> 00:18:04.125
Verse eight tells us why it's so that we are in all

328
00:18:04.745 --> 00:18:07.325
of the signs of God.

329
00:18:08.725 --> 00:18:11.135
They tell us, they remind us

330
00:18:12.075 --> 00:18:13.775
to seek God.

331
00:18:15.475 --> 00:18:16.825
We've all had that experience.

332
00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:17.985
If you've been out in nature,

333
00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:20.305
when you're looking at a sunset,

334
00:18:20.765 --> 00:18:24.025
you're looking at a mountain or watching the waves roll in

335
00:18:24.165 --> 00:18:28.465
and you're overwhelmed with the fact that we have a creator

336
00:18:29.945 --> 00:18:32.765
and that he created this beautiful place for us

337
00:18:33.315 --> 00:18:37.285
because he loved us and it speaks to the awesomeness

338
00:18:37.465 --> 00:18:39.405
and the power of God.

339
00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:43.605
Notice in verse five what it says by awesome deeds.

340
00:18:44.225 --> 00:18:48.445
You answer us, he's talking about prayer with righteousness.

341
00:18:49.145 --> 00:18:52.365
Oh God, of our salvation, the hope of all the ends

342
00:18:52.365 --> 00:18:57.205
of the earth to the farthest sees these things,

343
00:18:57.255 --> 00:18:58.405
these, the ocean

344
00:18:58.465 --> 00:19:02.445
and the mountains, they remind us of the, the fact that God

345
00:19:02.995 --> 00:19:04.845
answers our prayers.

346
00:19:06.065 --> 00:19:10.365
God hears our prayers. God can meet our need.

347
00:19:10.905 --> 00:19:13.805
God can bring salvation. Amen.

348
00:19:14.375 --> 00:19:17.285
These are monuments to the power of God.

349
00:19:18.265 --> 00:19:20.085
Let me ask you, did you come this morning

350
00:19:20.085 --> 00:19:21.565
with a prayer on your heart?

351
00:19:22.305 --> 00:19:23.725
Did you come with a need?

352
00:19:24.645 --> 00:19:27.405
I can tell you with assurance that God, the God

353
00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.165
who created the mountains,

354
00:19:29.305 --> 00:19:32.725
he can meet you at the point of that need.

355
00:19:33.575 --> 00:19:37.325
David is telling us that the to to look at the earth

356
00:19:37.465 --> 00:19:41.205
and see God can be, can be trusted.

357
00:19:41.585 --> 00:19:46.285
He has the power and the might to work in us and through us.

358
00:19:49.275 --> 00:19:51.915
I also know that it's very easy when we're going

359
00:19:51.915 --> 00:19:54.555
through difficult times to be

360
00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:59.315
so absorbed in our own troubles that we do not see

361
00:19:59.315 --> 00:20:03.075
that all that God is doing around us

362
00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:04.635
and around the world,

363
00:20:06.325 --> 00:20:09.905
but this Psalms reminds us, look what it says in verse five.

364
00:20:10.485 --> 00:20:13.945
It tells us that the God who holds the sea in the palm

365
00:20:13.945 --> 00:20:15.865
of his hand is the hope

366
00:20:16.205 --> 00:20:18.945
of all the ends of the earth.

367
00:20:21.135 --> 00:20:23.325
God's salvation began with a man

368
00:20:23.325 --> 00:20:26.805
and his family named Abraham out to the Hebrews,

369
00:20:27.345 --> 00:20:31.445
but then through Jesus Christ, we see that God's plan

370
00:20:31.785 --> 00:20:35.965
and mission to redeem a lost world moves farther than that

371
00:20:36.345 --> 00:20:38.045
and God is on a mission.

372
00:20:38.545 --> 00:20:42.845
He takes his his gospel, he takes his work across boundaries

373
00:20:42.845 --> 00:20:46.965
of nation races, language, geographical locations.

374
00:20:47.745 --> 00:20:51.765
God is the God of all nations is

375
00:20:51.765 --> 00:20:53.125
what this psalm declares.

376
00:20:55.555 --> 00:20:57.175
God blesses his people

377
00:20:58.515 --> 00:21:01.895
and he blesses his people to reach all peoples.

378
00:21:01.895 --> 00:21:03.735
That's what we believe here at Henderson Hills.

379
00:21:04.635 --> 00:21:06.895
We believe that God has blessed us.

380
00:21:06.955 --> 00:21:09.575
We have the gospel, we have the word of God.

381
00:21:09.955 --> 00:21:12.255
We can come together in freedom and worship.

382
00:21:12.915 --> 00:21:14.495
We worship with our families.

383
00:21:14.515 --> 00:21:16.695
We, we, we have beautiful services.

384
00:21:17.395 --> 00:21:19.415
We are a blessed people,

385
00:21:20.595 --> 00:21:23.895
but God blesses his people so that he can reach

386
00:21:25.155 --> 00:21:26.255
all people.

387
00:21:28.005 --> 00:21:30.995
This week we have a team

388
00:21:31.455 --> 00:21:35.755
of volunteers from our church going out to North Wells.

389
00:21:35.755 --> 00:21:38.235
They're gonna be led by Jennifer Monsour.

390
00:21:38.285 --> 00:21:39.635
She's gonna be leading that te

391
00:21:40.135 --> 00:21:42.115
and going to a country of wells

392
00:21:42.115 --> 00:21:45.875
where once they were evangelized, once they had the gospel,

393
00:21:45.925 --> 00:21:48.795
there were, there's huge church buildings over there,

394
00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:52.395
but from one generation not reaching the next,

395
00:21:52.975 --> 00:21:55.355
it is a country that is lost now in the churches,

396
00:21:55.935 --> 00:21:57.675
the large churches, 20 people

397
00:21:58.415 --> 00:22:00.235
and Jennifer's taking teams over there

398
00:22:00.535 --> 00:22:02.355
and they're going to be ministering

399
00:22:02.475 --> 00:22:03.715
to those people in wells.

400
00:22:03.895 --> 00:22:08.315
We have teams going to Columbia, Mexico, Nicaragua,

401
00:22:09.135 --> 00:22:12.675
Panama, Asia, Japan, Canada.

402
00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:14.915
Folks, we are busy

403
00:22:17.505 --> 00:22:19.005
and we are sending out people

404
00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:22.885
to the nations here at Henderson Hills this morning.

405
00:22:23.265 --> 00:22:25.085
We have had a church that we have worked

406
00:22:25.085 --> 00:22:27.685
with in Brussels for years.

407
00:22:28.385 --> 00:22:29.805
The pastor's name is Mike,

408
00:22:29.945 --> 00:22:32.405
his wife's name is Tina This morning.

409
00:22:32.955 --> 00:22:36.325
They are baptizing six new believers

410
00:22:36.585 --> 00:22:40.525
and all six are six different nationalities.

411
00:22:41.155 --> 00:22:45.005
Amen. We have a God who is a God

412
00:22:45.385 --> 00:22:46.445
of the nations.

413
00:22:48.395 --> 00:22:50.455
He is a God for everybody.

414
00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:55.415
This next Sunday, on June the second,

415
00:22:56.225 --> 00:22:59.695
we're gonna be having a, a future mission's lunch.

416
00:22:59.775 --> 00:23:01.255
You've been seeing that promoted,

417
00:23:01.915 --> 00:23:04.495
but it is a time where you can come

418
00:23:04.635 --> 00:23:06.775
and hear about all of these trips.

419
00:23:07.725 --> 00:23:11.415
It's a time where you can join God in his mission

420
00:23:11.915 --> 00:23:13.335
to reach the earth.

421
00:23:13.575 --> 00:23:15.935
I hope you'll come. I hope you'll participate in that

422
00:23:17.055 --> 00:23:18.185
this afternoon.

423
00:23:19.175 --> 00:23:22.425
From three to five, we have an open house.

424
00:23:22.925 --> 00:23:24.225
You probably didn't even know this,

425
00:23:24.285 --> 00:23:25.585
but we have mission houses

426
00:23:26.245 --> 00:23:29.545
and we have a mission houses where missionaries come

427
00:23:30.045 --> 00:23:31.265
and they can furlough

428
00:23:31.765 --> 00:23:33.905
and we just remodeled our mission house.

429
00:23:34.615 --> 00:23:37.625
It's a beautiful work. Jen George did a great job with that.

430
00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:40.585
Everybody contributed. It was an amazing achievement.

431
00:23:40.725 --> 00:23:44.145
We hope you'll this afternoon drop by from three to five

432
00:23:44.565 --> 00:23:45.645
and just look at this

433
00:23:45.645 --> 00:23:49.405
because this house is going to be used for missionaries

434
00:23:49.505 --> 00:23:51.125
to come while they're on furlough

435
00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:53.885
and rest fellowship with us.

436
00:23:54.235 --> 00:23:58.245
Tell their story and find ways that we can come alongside

437
00:23:58.245 --> 00:24:01.205
of them and bless them on their fields around the world.

438
00:24:01.595 --> 00:24:02.645
This is strategic.

439
00:24:02.675 --> 00:24:05.605
It's important, and we ask God to bless this.

440
00:24:05.905 --> 00:24:07.245
We hope you'll be part of that.

441
00:24:08.395 --> 00:24:12.805
This psalm reminds us that we have a God of all the nations.

442
00:24:13.705 --> 00:24:16.565
The last part of this psalm is going to be talking about

443
00:24:16.565 --> 00:24:20.565
that we need to trust in the God of blessings.

444
00:24:21.435 --> 00:24:25.565
Look what it says. You visit the earth and water it.

445
00:24:25.785 --> 00:24:30.325
You greatly enrich it. The rivers of God are full of water.

446
00:24:30.745 --> 00:24:35.405
You provide their grain for you are preparing it.

447
00:24:35.865 --> 00:24:40.605
You water it with furs abundantly settling the ridges,

448
00:24:41.035 --> 00:24:44.245
softening it with showers and blessing its growth.

449
00:24:44.865 --> 00:24:47.365
The crown of the year with your bounty,

450
00:24:47.785 --> 00:24:50.925
you wa your wagon tracks overflow with abundance.

451
00:24:51.585 --> 00:24:53.805
The pastors of the wilderness overflow.

452
00:24:54.065 --> 00:24:56.725
The hills gird themselves with joy.

453
00:24:57.345 --> 00:25:00.445
The meadows clothe themself with flocks.

454
00:25:00.905 --> 00:25:04.485
The the valleys deck themselves with grain.

455
00:25:04.915 --> 00:25:09.125
They shout a song together for joy.

456
00:25:10.335 --> 00:25:13.235
You get the picture. It's a picture of abundant.

457
00:25:13.695 --> 00:25:18.555
God himself cares for the world that he has made.

458
00:25:19.615 --> 00:25:23.995
God is not out of touch with his world. He is not outdated.

459
00:25:24.375 --> 00:25:26.355
He is participating in his world.

460
00:25:26.415 --> 00:25:29.875
He says it comes down and he waters it.

461
00:25:30.255 --> 00:25:32.715
The writer says he waters the land of the cr.

462
00:25:32.765 --> 00:25:36.315
David is declaring its God himself who comes

463
00:25:36.695 --> 00:25:39.315
and visits the earth, who waters the earth.

464
00:25:39.655 --> 00:25:41.755
He takes the ridges and softens them.

465
00:25:41.975 --> 00:25:44.315
He softens the ground with the rain so

466
00:25:44.315 --> 00:25:46.435
that the farmer can put in the seed

467
00:25:46.615 --> 00:25:48.435
and then that there is abundance harvest.

468
00:25:48.895 --> 00:25:53.315
It is God himself who is actively blessing us.

469
00:25:54.175 --> 00:25:58.075
It is not by our own hands. It is not by our technology.

470
00:25:58.585 --> 00:26:00.315
It's not by our creativity.

471
00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:05.475
We only thrive and are sustained because God is doing it.

472
00:26:05.775 --> 00:26:08.595
Yes, we sang this morning every breath,

473
00:26:09.535 --> 00:26:11.035
but do we really believe that?

474
00:26:12.155 --> 00:26:14.115
I tell you what, I had the privilege of working

475
00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:17.235
as a hospital for almost nine years as a chaplain

476
00:26:17.335 --> 00:26:19.995
and set by people every day that struggled

477
00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:23.775
for the next breath, and they learned really quick that it's

478
00:26:23.775 --> 00:26:25.895
by God's grace that the next breath comes.

479
00:26:26.925 --> 00:26:29.415
This is a God who is in our creation,

480
00:26:29.515 --> 00:26:33.215
who is working in our lives, A God who can be trusted.

481
00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:37.095
He's also a God who has made it profitable.

482
00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:40.575
Look what it says in verse 11. He's describing the harvest.

483
00:26:40.715 --> 00:26:43.095
He says, the harvest that people enjoy

484
00:26:43.275 --> 00:26:46.485
because God has made the earth profitable.

485
00:26:46.865 --> 00:26:50.925
It is, it is. It's interesting to me as I travel

486
00:26:51.665 --> 00:26:55.045
all the different kinds of foods that really happen

487
00:26:55.045 --> 00:26:57.205
because there's all these different kinds

488
00:26:57.205 --> 00:26:58.845
of soil in the earth.

489
00:26:59.225 --> 00:27:02.765
God is an amazing God. He, he, he does all of this.

490
00:27:03.045 --> 00:27:04.485
I don't know if you realize it or not,

491
00:27:04.905 --> 00:27:09.125
but um, in Peru, for example, Peru boast

492
00:27:09.185 --> 00:27:13.005
of over 4,000 potato variations.

493
00:27:13.585 --> 00:27:15.245
Now, now I know what you're thinking right now.

494
00:27:15.445 --> 00:27:19.485
I thought there was only two mashed and and baked right,

495
00:27:20.545 --> 00:27:23.645
but, but there's actually 4,000 varieties

496
00:27:23.665 --> 00:27:25.485
of potatoes in Peru.

497
00:27:25.485 --> 00:27:27.565
They're, they're farmed in the Andean region

498
00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:32.405
of Peru raging from purple to pink to blue to red varieties.

499
00:27:33.145 --> 00:27:34.165
And here's the point.

500
00:27:34.635 --> 00:27:38.405
This is not just some random chance.

501
00:27:40.115 --> 00:27:44.925
This is a God who by design an activity in his creation

502
00:27:45.745 --> 00:27:47.085
has created diversity

503
00:27:47.545 --> 00:27:49.645
and different soils and different plants.

504
00:27:50.025 --> 00:27:51.565
The Andean people know

505
00:27:51.795 --> 00:27:54.365
that if you get too much rain one year only

506
00:27:54.365 --> 00:27:55.405
these potatoes grow.

507
00:27:56.025 --> 00:27:58.125
If you don't have any rain that year,

508
00:27:58.275 --> 00:27:59.805
only these potatoes grow.

509
00:28:00.025 --> 00:28:03.285
But the truth is they know they will always have food

510
00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:05.285
because God thought of that

511
00:28:07.175 --> 00:28:10.875
God is an incredible God and he is active in this earth

512
00:28:10.935 --> 00:28:11.955
and he made this earth

513
00:28:12.175 --> 00:28:13.875
and he brings a harvest to the people.

514
00:28:14.445 --> 00:28:16.595
Psalm 65 reminds us

515
00:28:16.825 --> 00:28:20.315
that God is bringing a harvest not only of abundance

516
00:28:20.495 --> 00:28:21.635
and provision for us,

517
00:28:21.935 --> 00:28:26.435
but a harvest of souls of people around the world.

518
00:28:26.855 --> 00:28:30.195
The key to understanding this last section has to do

519
00:28:30.195 --> 00:28:31.875
with the abundance of the harvest.

520
00:28:32.305 --> 00:28:35.755
Look at it just very briefly bef in verse nine.

521
00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:39.515
You greatly enrich it that says, the rivers

522
00:28:39.515 --> 00:28:41.235
of God are full of water.

523
00:28:41.295 --> 00:28:42.475
Do you catch the language?

524
00:28:42.765 --> 00:28:47.115
Verse 10, the water in its furrows abundantly.

525
00:28:47.695 --> 00:28:50.915
You crown verse 11, you crown the years with your bounty.

526
00:28:51.105 --> 00:28:55.035
Your wagon tracks overflow with abundance.

527
00:28:55.295 --> 00:28:58.715
The picture here is that the harvest is so great

528
00:28:59.025 --> 00:29:02.475
that the grain on the cart is falling off of the harvest

529
00:29:02.895 --> 00:29:05.115
and it's filling the wagon tracks

530
00:29:05.415 --> 00:29:07.395
and nobody's even going back to pick it up.

531
00:29:07.505 --> 00:29:12.395
Because of the abundance of God, the blessings

532
00:29:12.575 --> 00:29:16.955
of God, God blesses us abundantly.

533
00:29:18.675 --> 00:29:21.945
Every day I watch tv, it tells me I don't have enough

534
00:29:23.545 --> 00:29:24.805
and I deserve more.

535
00:29:25.625 --> 00:29:29.685
But when I read this book, I see God telling me

536
00:29:30.445 --> 00:29:32.445
I have made provision for you.

537
00:29:32.905 --> 00:29:37.885
It is enough and be grateful and be generous.

538
00:29:39.735 --> 00:29:40.775
I look at this passage

539
00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:45.485
and I realize that God is not a stingy God

540
00:29:46.435 --> 00:29:48.085
with the things of this earth.

541
00:29:49.145 --> 00:29:51.485
He is a blessing God who gives us,

542
00:29:51.825 --> 00:29:56.485
and God is overflowing with his blessings on us,

543
00:29:57.465 --> 00:29:58.925
and we are to be grateful for that.

544
00:30:00.525 --> 00:30:02.215
This is a beautiful Psalms

545
00:30:03.555 --> 00:30:05.855
and it speaks to our relationship to God.

546
00:30:06.515 --> 00:30:07.935
It speaks of our world.

547
00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:11.295
It speaks of God's mission to redeem the world,

548
00:30:12.195 --> 00:30:13.655
but it also speaks to us.

549
00:30:14.835 --> 00:30:16.815
Let me ask you the question once more.

550
00:30:18.165 --> 00:30:20.905
How big is your God?

551
00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:28.935
Maybe you're here today

552
00:30:31.015 --> 00:30:34.395
and you're feeling tossed around in a roaring sea of life

553
00:30:35.715 --> 00:30:38.535
and you're thinking to yourself it is out of control

554
00:30:38.555 --> 00:30:39.575
and it is hopeless.

555
00:30:40.665 --> 00:30:45.095
Maybe you're even asking yourself, can God help?

556
00:30:46.935 --> 00:30:49.275
Can God even hear my prayers?

557
00:30:51.155 --> 00:30:54.695
And I'm here to tell you based on the word of God,

558
00:30:55.085 --> 00:30:59.775
that the God who spoke the mountains into existence hears

559
00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:04.385
your prayer and can do something about it.

560
00:31:05.435 --> 00:31:07.505
Jesus, when he was with his disciples,

561
00:31:08.085 --> 00:31:11.585
was in a storm one night and he got up from his sleep

562
00:31:11.685 --> 00:31:14.345
and he walked out and looked at the storm in the life

563
00:31:14.345 --> 00:31:17.425
of his disciples, and then he looked at the storm over the

564
00:31:17.445 --> 00:31:20.665
sea and all he did was say two words, be quiet, be still,

565
00:31:21.605 --> 00:31:23.185
and the wave ceased.

566
00:31:24.385 --> 00:31:26.885
And listen, if Jesus can say two words

567
00:31:27.145 --> 00:31:30.325
and come a sea in his power

568
00:31:30.745 --> 00:31:34.445
and in his love, he can speak into your life

569
00:31:36.005 --> 00:31:37.265
and he can make a difference.

570
00:31:38.715 --> 00:31:39.865
Maybe you're here today

571
00:31:42.225 --> 00:31:44.685
and you're feeling the weight of your sin.

572
00:31:46.085 --> 00:31:47.315
David said it this way.

573
00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:50.875
Our iniquities continue to prevail against us.

574
00:31:52.255 --> 00:31:54.165
We're heavy from that load.

575
00:31:54.745 --> 00:31:57.045
We are living in ways

576
00:31:57.115 --> 00:32:01.165
that we should not live all of us sin.

577
00:32:01.165 --> 00:32:03.925
The Bible says and falls short of the holiness

578
00:32:04.385 --> 00:32:06.365
and the glory of God.

579
00:32:07.485 --> 00:32:11.305
But God rather than issue wrath on us,

580
00:32:11.885 --> 00:32:13.425
he makes provision for us.

581
00:32:14.405 --> 00:32:16.105
God is merciful.

582
00:32:16.105 --> 00:32:20.385
The Bible says, and he covers our sin that we have committed

583
00:32:20.385 --> 00:32:21.825
because he loves us.

584
00:32:23.725 --> 00:32:26.145
But God is not just a loving God.

585
00:32:26.965 --> 00:32:29.905
He is a holy and a just God

586
00:32:30.445 --> 00:32:33.625
and his just must be satisfied.

587
00:32:34.685 --> 00:32:38.145
And the Bible says that out of that sense of justice,

588
00:32:38.735 --> 00:32:42.405
just like a judge on the bench could be merciful,

589
00:32:42.865 --> 00:32:44.165
but he has to be fair.

590
00:32:44.705 --> 00:32:47.685
He has to be just, he has to follow the law.

591
00:32:49.705 --> 00:32:51.165
God in his mercy

592
00:32:51.385 --> 00:32:53.685
and in his justice, he He,

593
00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:56.725
he pays the price for our sin.

594
00:32:57.385 --> 00:33:00.965
And the Bible says the price was the sacrificial

595
00:33:00.965 --> 00:33:02.485
death of his son.

596
00:33:03.785 --> 00:33:08.525
God loved us enough that he sent his only son to die

597
00:33:08.585 --> 00:33:11.885
for us to redeem us, to cover us,

598
00:33:12.305 --> 00:33:14.765
to change his relationship with us.

599
00:33:15.825 --> 00:33:19.085
So it satisfies his justice

600
00:33:20.265 --> 00:33:22.205
and it's motivated out of his love.

601
00:33:23.065 --> 00:33:25.325
And all we do is come to him.

602
00:33:26.225 --> 00:33:28.085
The atonement is found.

603
00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:31.285
Our salvation is found in the death, burial,

604
00:33:31.465 --> 00:33:33.525
and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

605
00:33:37.685 --> 00:33:42.645
I believe that this psalm is calling us to God, to repent

606
00:33:43.925 --> 00:33:47.945
and to surrender our lives to Jesus Christ as our only Lord

607
00:33:47.945 --> 00:33:50.025
and Savior, the provision that God has made

608
00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:56.345
and then with all of our might, with every cell in our body,

609
00:33:56.855 --> 00:33:58.665
with every minute on our clock,

610
00:33:59.095 --> 00:34:02.625
with every resource in our pocket, with every strength

611
00:34:02.725 --> 00:34:06.105
of we have in our muscles to live

612
00:34:06.605 --> 00:34:09.745
and praise God because he is our savior

613
00:34:10.725 --> 00:34:12.425
and he is our sustainer.

614
00:34:12.895 --> 00:34:13.185
Amen.
