1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.400
Even though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death. I

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.000
will not fear for you are with me. You are

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.500
my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.900
You restore me and Lead Me For Your Glory.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.300
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.500
Well, good morning everyone. Hey, that

7
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.800
was pretty good.

8
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.400
As Ryan mentioned last week was

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.300
spring break which is why many of our students

10
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.300
were on a mission trip.

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.400
And although I don't have kids that

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.300
are still in school. I had spring break last week as

13
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.200
well. My wife and I took the week off

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.500
and we did some really exciting things. We got

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.700
to do things like clean out gutters trim

16
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.200
trees paint have Plumbing

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.800
work done at our house all kinds

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.100
of really fun stuff. So it was a very

19
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.800
restful week.

20
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.400
But today we're going to look at Psalm 54.

21
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.000
And I'm gonna go ahead and invite you to

22
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.300
go ahead and get your Bibles out whether you have printed copy

23
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
or digital copy. Go

24
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.100
ahead and get them out get them ready get to that spot and we'll be using

25
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.100
that in just a minute.

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.400
But as I studied for this message, I started

27
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.900
looking for some stories from

28
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.300
people who had come to

29
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.700
the end of their resources.

30
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.100
And they had nothing left.

31
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
But to ask God to do something that only he

32
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.600
could do.

33
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.300
And I came across this story about Dallas Theological

34
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.800
Seminary.

35
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.200
And so it goes like this in 1924

36
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.000
Dallas Theological Seminary

37
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.400
almost went bankrupt.

38
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.400
And on the day that it was supposed to be foreclosed on at

39
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.900
noon.

40
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.300
Dr. Harry Ironside the president of the

41
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.400
Seminary at the time held a prayer

42
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.500
meeting in his office.

43
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.400
And that day Dr. Ironside prayed a

44
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400
prayer that he had prayed many many times before.

45
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.700
But on this day, he prayed it like this. It says Lord,

46
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.400
we know that the cattle on a thousand hills

47
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400
are thine.

48
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.400
Please sell some of them and give us the money.

49
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.300
Makes sense, right?

50
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.400
So as he prayed with some staff

51
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.600
and faculty there a tall Texas oil

52
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.000
man walked into the receptionist office

53
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.500
and he said I just sold

54
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.300
two carloads full of

55
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.700
cattle.

56
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.700
You see where this is going, don't you?

57
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.400
And he said I've been trying to make this business deal

58
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.800
work and it just won't it won't go through.

59
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.700
So I feel compelled to give this money to the

60
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.200
Seminary.

61
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.200
He goes, I don't know if you really need this or not. But here's the

62
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.600
check.

63
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.500
the receptionist jumped up ran in and burst

64
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.400
into the room where everybody was praying and said Harry

65
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.600
God just sold the cattle.

66
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.300
Now Dr. Ironside and his staff they

67
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.900
were desperate.

68
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.000
They were out of resources and the bank was going to

69
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.800
come call it.

70
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.000
And he and them were completely dependent

71
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.600
upon God.

72
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.400
And God came through.

73
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.100
And he did it with style.

74
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.600
One of our values as a church is that we rely on

75
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.700
the Holy Spirit to empower our lives and

76
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.000
the church as we humbly abide in

77
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.100
Jesus.

78
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.200
Recognizing that we can do nothing apart from

79
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.500
him.

80
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.300
Have you ever found yourself in a situation? Were you

81
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.800
have exhausted all of your resources?

82
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.800
You got nothing left?

83
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.100
How are you going to solve a problem that you have?

84
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.000
No resources for?

85
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.100
You're destitute you're desperate.

86
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.800
And you're utterly dependent on someone else.

87
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.400
To get you out of trouble.

88
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.900
Psalm 54 David gives us a perfect example

89
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.600
Of what desperate dependence is

90
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.500
supposed to look like?

91
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.400
Now I didn't set out to preach a sermon on one of

92
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.300
our values. This is just the psalm. That was next.

93
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.600
But this Psalm really spoke to my life and it

94
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.700
it very quickly became obvious

95
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.300
that this was one of

96
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
those psalms that just exemplified what it

97
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.500
looks like to live out this value in our lives.

98
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.300
So I asked you to open up your Bible. So let's let's go

99
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.300
there to Psalm 54 and we're going to read God's

100
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.900
word together.

101
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.300
Now there's a line at the beginning of

102
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.600
this Psalm before you get to the actual verses. I'm gonna

103
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.400
go ahead and read that it may or may not be in your Bible. But

104
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.100
then I'll talk about it here in a minute. So that

105
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.700
line says to the choir Master with

106
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.100
stringed instruments a mask of David.

107
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.700
When the zephites went and told Saul is not David hiding

108
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.100
Among Us.

109
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.400
Verse 1. Oh God, Save Me by your name

110
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.400
and vindicate me by your might o God

111
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.800
here my prayer.

112
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.400
Give ear to the words of my mouth for strangers have

113
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.300
risen against me.

114
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.900
Ruthless men seek my life.

115
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.400
They do not set God before themselves. Say la.

116
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.600
Behold God is my helper.

117
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.600
And the Lord is the upholder of my life.

118
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.100
He will return the evil to my enemies and your

119
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.900
faithfulness put an end to them.

120
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.800
With a free will offering I sacrifice to you.

121
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.000
I will give thanks to your name O Lord for

122
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.700
it is good.

123
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.200
For he has delivered me from every trouble.

124
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.600
And my eye has looked in Triumph on

125
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.300
my enemies.

126
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.500
So looking at this Psalm that opening line

127
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.000
is what's known as a superscript.

128
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.200
And that's just an informational line that gives us

129
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.300
more details about what's to come.

130
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.900
So the first thing that we see is that this is written

131
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.600
to the choir Master with stringed instruments.

132
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.900
So this just means that the author intended that

133
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.000
this be sung in a corporate setting with

134
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.500
accompanying instruments.

135
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.900
And next is it's a mask goal of David David.

136
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.100
In this case is the soon-to-be king

137
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.700
of Israel.

138
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.400
What's a maskel?

139
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.600
I'm glad you asked.

140
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.800
A mask who is just a literary term that means to instruct

141
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800
or make perceivable.

142
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.700
This Psalm was not only to be used in a

143
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.300
corporate worship setting but it was intended to

144
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.500
instruct God's people.

145
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.400
And I pray that it instructs us today.

146
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.700
Next it references the zephites.

147
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.300
Telling Saul that David's hiding Among

148
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.500
Us.

149
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.200
This reference gives us direct insight to what's going on

150
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.700
in David's life as he wrote this

151
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.600
and we know that this reference is to first

152
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.800
saw a first Samuel 23.

153
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.400
So what happened to David that it would

154
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.900
Inspire him to write this?

155
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.300
Well this first Samuel 23 is the

156
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.300
account of David going to

157
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:05.900
the aid.

158
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.500
of the city of kiela

159
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.400
Now I'm certain that I mispronounced that I tried

160
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.800
the Hebrew pronunciation in my Bible software and you're

161
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.100
just going to get the Oki version.

162
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.800
Got no shot.

163
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.300
So David was told that the

164
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.300
Philistines were attacking and robbing the city of

165
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.000
kiela.

166
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.000
And so David sought the Lord and asked if

167
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.600
he should go and attack the Philistines.

168
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.100
And the Lord answered him. Yes.

169
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.100
But David's men were afraid.

170
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.100
So David sought the Lord a second time.

171
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.500
And the Lord responds to David once again.

172
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.700
He says that he will deliver the Philistines into

173
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.300
their hands.

174
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.700
So David does his Lord instructs and he

175
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.100
goes and he attacks and defeats the

176
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.900
Philistines and saves the city.

177
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.500
but in doing this David catches the attention of Saul

178
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.600
who is actually seeking to kill David at the time because he

179
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.500
was a threat to the throne of Israel.

180
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.300
So Saul plots to send an

181
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.800
army to the city of kiela.

182
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.900
And trap David in the city because this was

183
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.200
a city that had walls and

184
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.400
Gates and Saul knew that if he could get there

185
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.300
and trap David inside.

186
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.100
He would have them.

187
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.200
David Gets wind of this plot of Saul

188
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:42.600
and

189
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.700
once again, he cries out to the Lord.

190
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.500
and the Lord replies

191
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.700
And assures David that he should in fact go he should

192
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:52.900
leave.

193
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.500
Otherwise the city that he just saved.

194
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.000
Would certainly turn him and his men over to Saul's

195
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.300
Army.

196
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.300
So David and his men they flee Into the Wilderness.

197
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:08.800
when

198
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.400
Saul heard that David had escaped he gave

199
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.100
up his plot.

200
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.300
So if you want to know more about what happened between David

201
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.000
and Saul

202
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.300
go and read first Samuel 23 and

203
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.600
24. It truly is one of the great stories

204
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.700
of the Bible and how God

205
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.800
perseveres.

206
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.200
So in Psalm 54, we have three sections.

207
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.800
And the first of these three sections is verses 1

208
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.200
through 3.

209
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.300
And this represents David's cry for help.

210
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.800
Verse 1 says oh God Save Me by your name and vindicate

211
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.400
me by your might who God hear my

212
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.400
prayer give ear to the words of my mouth for

213
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.000
strangers have risen against me ruthless men

214
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.800
seek my life.

215
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.300
They do not set God before themselves.

216
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.500
say la sala is just a word that calls our

217
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.700
attention that there's something that we should stop and meditate

218
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.100
on and focus on and give our

219
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.800
attention to

220
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.100
So verses 1 and 2 David says save me.

221
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.200
Help me.

222
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.200
And in the first Samuel account David sought the Lord and

223
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.800
he cried out to God to save him.

224
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.500
from The Strangers

225
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.500
Okay.

226
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.300
He knew and he deeply believed that God

227
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.200
would save him.

228
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.000
Just as he had before.

229
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.100
David knows that God is the only one that can

230
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.500
help him.

231
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.800
And we know just as David did that God

232
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.400
is our rescuer.

233
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.300
Our Redeemer our protector

234
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.600
and our sustainer

235
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:04.700
think about this.

236
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.300
David was being hunted by Saul the

237
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.600
king of Israel.

238
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.200
That's not good.

239
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200
That's really really bad.

240
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.200
think of this in terms of

241
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.300
the president and the Armed Forces of

242
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.900
the United States hunting you

243
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.000
That's almost certainly you're going to

244
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.100
get caught and killed, right?

245
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.200
You got no chance.

246
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.600
Saul's Army intended to find David

247
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.700
and kill him and his men.

248
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.900
We may not have somebody out to kill us.

249
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.000
But often we do have enemies, don't we?

250
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.800
And they try and do us harm. Maybe even destroy us

251
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.800
destroy our reputations.

252
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.800
We've all had somebody who was out to get us.

253
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.400
And trying to cause us hardship.

254
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.600
have your souls

255
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.500
been fellow Christians

256
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.100
How painful is that?

257
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.600
The answer is it's horribly painful.

258
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.100
People that are supposed to love and care for you attacking you.

259
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.000
What's that about?

260
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.300
Is this really how we're supposed to treat each other?

261
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.900
Oh Jesus and John 13 34

262
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.500
and 35 has something to say about that.

263
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.900
It says a new commandment. I give to you that you

264
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.600
love you have love for one

265
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.200
another just as I have loved you.

266
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.800
You are also to love one another by this

267
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.600
all people.

268
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.700
will know

269
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.200
that you are my disciples.

270
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.200
if you have love for one another

271
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.300
we're supposed to love each other not attack each

272
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:06.300
other.

273
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.600
But this Brokenness this hatred and jealousy.

274
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.800
Where people seek to do harm to each other for no good

275
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:16.900
reason.

276
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.500
Is why God had to send his son to die for our

277
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:21.900
sins.

278
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.400
Jesus had to pay the price for our wickedness.

279
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.600
If you've ever been attacked in this way.

280
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.400
You've probably experienced deep hurt.

281
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.400
This kind of hurt it stays with you for

282
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.000
a lifetime.

283
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.200
If that's ever happened to you, I am really really

284
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.600
sorry.

285
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.600
It shouldn't be that way.

286
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.400
It's happened to me.

287
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.900
More than I care to think about.

288
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.500
And it happened to David.

289
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.700
You see verse 3 says that for strangers

290
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.300
have risen against me.

291
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.500
The zephites are actually The Strangers that David is referring

292
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:08.900
to here.

293
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.700
And they were known in maybe in some of your translations that

294
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.700
uses these words as ruthless and Violent

295
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.000
Men.

296
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:19.700
but

297
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.400
these people were not strangers at all.

298
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.400
They were fellow Israelites.

299
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.300
The word for strangers here in Hebrew just refers

300
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.400
to someone or something.

301
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.000
That is foreign to the

302
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.800
community where it's standards.

303
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.100
These men weren't strangers to David's

304
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.200
Nation, but they were strangers to

305
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.700
the faith that they were supposed to share.

306
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.900
They were not part of the true Israel.

307
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.100
The Apostle Paul was one of the most highly thought about

308
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.800
the thought of Jews until he met Jesus.

309
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.400
Romans 28 or 2:28 and 29 says

310
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.300
for no one is a Jew who is

311
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.000
merely one outwardly.

312
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.700
Nor is circumcision outward and physical.

313
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.800
But a Jew is one inwardly and circumcision is

314
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.600
a matter of the heart.

315
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.200
by the spirit

316
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.100
not by the letter.

317
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.900
His praise is not from man, but from God.

318
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.400
These men weren't just betraying David.

319
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.100
They were betraying their faith.

320
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:39.400
and God

321
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.900
how Despicable

322
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.600
how outrageous

323
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.300
That these men would act this way.

324
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.000
They were supposed to be brothers.

325
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:56.700
Wait a minute.

326
00:16:59.100 --> 00:16:59.900
Let's flip this around.

327
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:02.900
Are you?

328
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.800
The Saul in someone else's story

329
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.600
I know that one stings.

330
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.400
It stung me.

331
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.900
Have you ever been so mad about something or at

332
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.700
someone that you went on the attack against

333
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.000
them?

334
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.200
Maybe you didn't attack them directly. Maybe you just attack them to

335
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:28.700
other people.

336
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.200
If we're honest

337
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.800
most of us probably have

338
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:39.900
My point is this.

339
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.400
If we can identify with David.

340
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.300
We should be honest.

341
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.900
And identify with Saul as well.

342
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.600
It's easy to see ourselves as victims.

343
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.700
We have to be honest with ourselves.

344
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.300
And see that we are more like Saul than we

345
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.000
want to admit.

346
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.200
the difference is how

347
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.300
or if

348
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.500
we seek the Lord.

349
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.000
I'm sorry.

350
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.600
I had to do that.

351
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.600
But as I studied and prayed through this this was

352
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.400
one of those lightning bolts that hit me.

353
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.500
And I was deeply convicted.

354
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:32.500
that

355
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.500
I have definitely been the Saul and someone else's story.

356
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.100
And that's not right.

357
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.500
Sometimes I lose sight of my

358
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:48.800
faith.

359
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.400
And I become the attacker.

360
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:52.800
instead of

361
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.600
acting like David and crying out to God.

362
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.700
Okay back to happy thoughts.

363
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.300
In verse 1 and 2 David views God

364
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.000
as his savior his helper the upholder of

365
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.400
his life.

366
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.600
and he trusted

367
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.000
in God and in God alone to

368
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.500
be just

369
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.200
but David didn't just view God as

370
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.200
his savior or rescuer or his get out

371
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.100
of jail free card.

372
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.100
He also believed he was his Lord.

373
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.300
You see for salvation. We we don't

374
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.800
only receive forgiveness.

375
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.400
for our sins

376
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:39.900
or

377
00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.400
Jesus says our savior, but we

378
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.200
also receive Jesus as our Lord.

379
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.600
Read first Samuel 23 for yourself. David didn't

380
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.100
decide for himself.

381
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.700
He asked God what to do.

382
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.500
God directed his steps.

383
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.100
And because of this David worshiped the Lord.

384
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.000
And he gladly gave an offering to it.

385
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.600
As I studied for Samuel in the psalm. I saw

386
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.500
something in David's prayer that I think is actually missing in

387
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.400
mine a lot of the time.

388
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.700
David asked the Lord Lord. What do you want?

389
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.700
How do you want me to act?

390
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800
And God answered him.

391
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.200
Now what it seems like in this text is that

392
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.600
David heard the audible voice of God?

393
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.900
And got a response immediately.

394
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.100
But the text doesn't actually say that but that's what

395
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:46.700
it seems like.

396
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.800
It might have been an immediate voice of God moment.

397
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.700
Or it might have been a day.

398
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.300
a week

399
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:56.700
a month

400
00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.500
Even longer we don't know.

401
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.200
What we do know is that David expected an answer?

402
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.400
And he had no conditions on that answer. His hands were

403
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.700
open.

404
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.800
Lord I will do what you ask.

405
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.600
See changing what I asked

406
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.800
for. That's actually the easy part.

407
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.400
Being willing to wait for the answer.

408
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.700
With no conditions and open hands and

409
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.100
an open heart for God to say

410
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.400
what he wants me to do.

411
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.400
That that's a challenge.

412
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.500
That's difficult.

413
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:40.700
for us

414
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.100
As Christians this means we have to

415
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.100
see Jesus as Lord.

416
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.700
Not is the magic grantor of self-centered wishes.

417
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.800
And this brings us to Verses 4 and 5.

418
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.100
And David has issued a confession of his

419
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:03.600
faith.

420
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.000
Behold God is my helper. And the Lord is the upholder

421
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.700
of my life.

422
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.200
Here David makes a change in

423
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.100
the tone of this psalm.

424
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.500
He seemingly stops to acknowledge God as the upholder

425
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.900
and the sustainer of his life.

426
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.200
David is declaring that God is the one who does for him

427
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.600
what he cannot do for himself.

428
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.800
He's in a vulnerable state.

429
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:35.800
He's trapped.

430
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.700
His enemies are bearing down on him.

431
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.500
And he is powerless.

432
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.200
To stop Saul's attempts to kill him.

433
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.500
He can't talk or fight his way out of it, and he

434
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.200
recognizes that this is all in God's hands.

435
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.200
We say that a lot don't we it's in God's hands.

436
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.500
But how often are you actually in a situation where it

437
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.900
is really in God's hands.

438
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.000
It's David reminding himself and us that

439
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.000
this is the nature of God. He is

440
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.100
the one in control and he is

441
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.800
upholding Our Lives by his will.

442
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.700
He's saying his tone seems to go beyond just a

443
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.600
casual reminder to summon up

444
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.700
the courage in the to have

445
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.500
confidence in God In This Moment.

446
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.100
He actually seems to Delight in the truth of it all.

447
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.100
It's a joy for him to be able to have full confidence

448
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.200
in God.

449
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.400
I think about how little I go beyond

450
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.500
merely knowing that God is in control but truly

451
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.500
delighting in it.

452
00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.700
That's a true work of the Holy Spirit.

453
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.700
As for me to be able to Delight.

454
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.500
In the fact that I'm not in control.

455
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.400
God is

456
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.600
I'm in his hands.

457
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.700
Everything in US wants to fight and scratch and

458
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.200
Claw for control of our own lives.

459
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.300
But David, he's demonstrating that there's

460
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.700
a restful joy in trusting God fully.

461
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.300
Even when evil is coming for you.

462
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.500
If you belong to God.

463
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.800
Nothing can change that.

464
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.400
If you have trusted Jesus to be your lord and

465
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.400
your savior, then he is both your savior

466
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.000
and your distress.

467
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.500
And he is your lord.

468
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.200
Over the outcomes of the challenges of your life.

469
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.700
I'm going to say that one more time. He is your savior in

470
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.200
distress and the Lord over the outcome

471
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.600
of the challenges of your life.

472
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.200
God is in control of it all.

473
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.000
every minute

474
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.100
every detail

475
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:21.400
all of it.

476
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.500
In verse 5 it says he will return the evil

477
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.500
to my enemies.

478
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.800
In your faithfulness put an end to them.

479
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.900
You see evil wants to come for us all.

480
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.900
If we belong to God evil wants what God has.

481
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.500
Evil is literally born into us.

482
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.300
Through the as descendants of the first man Adam.

483
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.000
But when you read your Bible and you watch closely.

484
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.300
You'll see that God always prevails always.

485
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.300
David knows this

486
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.900
As Christians we're probably kind of uncomfortable with verse

487
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.000
5.

488
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.500
Doesn't the Bible tell us to turn the other cheek

489
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.800
and pray for our enemies.

490
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.100
His first seems to go directly against that.

491
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.300
David is declaring that God will destroy his enemies.

492
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.500
It just seems wrong and vindictive.

493
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.000
But if we look closely at what David's actually saying he's he's

494
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.600
asking God to do something. He's not

495
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.200
asking God to do something that's out outside of his

496
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.300
character. He's actually asking God to act according

497
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.800
to his character.

498
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.800
You see God is the writer of wrongs.

499
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.600
Why else would he take the penalty for

500
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.300
our sin and rebellion and

501
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:56.800
wickedness?

502
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.200
Why would he take that on his own son?

503
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.600
Sacrificing him to die a sinner's

504
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:05.800
death.

505
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.300
just to write the wrongs that each one of us are guilty of

506
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.400
David is asking God to act in accordance

507
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.800
with his faithfulness and Truth.

508
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.900
Romans 3:21 through 26 says but now

509
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.100
the righteousness of God has been manifested apart

510
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.300
from the law although the law and

511
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.100
the prophets bear witness to it.

512
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.600
the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus

513
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.900
Christ for all who believe

514
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.500
For there is no distinction for all have sinned

515
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.100
and fall short of the glory of God and are

516
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.600
justified by his grace as a

517
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:50.800
gift.

518
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.200
Through the Redemption that is in Christ

519
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.600
Jesus whom God put forward as a propitiation

520
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.200
or a substitute.

521
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.900
by his blood

522
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.000
to be received by faith

523
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.400
This was to show God's righteousness.

524
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:10.800
because

525
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.400
In his Divine forbearance. He had passed

526
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.600
over former sins.

527
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.200
It was to show his righteousness at the present time.

528
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.400
So that he might be just and the justifier

529
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.800
of the one who has faith in

530
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.200
Jesus.

531
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.900
You see God made, right?

532
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.900
the greatest wrong

533
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.000
in all of human history

534
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.200
sin

535
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.900
He wiped it out.

536
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.500
by the blood of Jesus

537
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.500
he wiped it out by the blood of Jesus.

538
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.900
for all those who have faith in him

539
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.500
because of the character of God David has

540
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.400
complete confidence that the Lord only has

541
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.400
his good in mind. He has complete confidence that

542
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.400
the Lord will deliver Justice in his

543
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.400
way and in his time.

544
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.000
the righteous way

545
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.900
our last section points us to

546
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.700
David's promise to worship

547
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.100
verse 6 says with a free will offering I

548
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.200
will sacrifice to you.

549
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.400
I will give thanks to your name. Oh lord for it

550
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:38.900
is good.

551
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.900
As David is anticipating.

552
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.900
The victory over his enemies he

553
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.900
is consumed with gratefulness that drives

554
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.800
this deep need to worship His rescuer.

555
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.200
His worship begins with a free will offering this

556
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.800
isn't some pre-prescribed offering.

557
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.200
It's an offering that is produced out of

558
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.600
his desire to worship.

559
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.000
He didn't have to do it. He wanted to do it.

560
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.300
David is worshiping God for something that God hasn't even

561
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:19.700
done yet.

562
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.300
David is also sharing his story of

563
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.700
Deliverance with God's people.

564
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.500
So that they can worship together.

565
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.500
And celebrate God's victory.

566
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.800
Because he knows that joining together in worship will

567
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.800
bring greater glory to God and it

568
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.300
will encourage the faith of God's people.

569
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.300
David is worshiping God based on

570
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.000
his name.

571
00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.300
Remember how God is referenced in Verses 4

572
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:55.700
and 5?

573
00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.900
helper upholder sustainer of

574
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.200
his life deliverer of Justice

575
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.500
He is worshiping God.

576
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.300
Not based on what he is done, but what

577
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.000
he will do.

578
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.600
It hasn't happened yet.

579
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.700
He's worshiping God just for who he is.

580
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.400
These verses are describing.

581
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.600
the who of God

582
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.000
not just the what?

583
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.100
David's worship is also driven by his confidence

584
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.600
in God.

585
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.200
His confidence in him as rescuer.

586
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.100
Because of what God has done for him in the past.

587
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.300
You remember a story called David and Goliath?

588
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.300
Once again David defeated a foe who

589
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.900
was by all accounts.

590
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.700
an actual Giant

591
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.700
and David was this little guy with a

592
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.000
slingshot?

593
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:02.600
and yet

594
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.100
he defeats the Giant.

595
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.700
David no, stranger

596
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.700
to God delivering victory

597
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.900
No matter what the odds.

598
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.200
Or the evil that stacked against him.

599
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.400
and this

600
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.000
is fuel for his worship.

601
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.500
No, we've seen David cry for

602
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:29.700
help.

603
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.500
We've seen him confess his faith and we've seen

604
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.500
him worship God.

605
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.500
For us as Believers, this Psalm

606
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:40.900
is a reminder.

607
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.700
It's a reminder that we can and we should have

608
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.500
confidence in Jesus Philippians 2

609
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.500
9 and 10 says therefore God is highly

610
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.500
exalted him and bestowed on him the name that

611
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.400
is above every name so that

612
00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.500
at the name of Jesus every knee should

613
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.000
bow in heaven and honor and under

614
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.400
the Earth and every tongue confess

615
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.500
that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of

616
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.500
God the Father.

617
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.500
Satan will use the ungodly to

618
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.300
threaten our faith and all that we hold

619
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:17.700
dear.

620
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.400
This Psalm is the reminder that God Alone

621
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.100
holds the keys to Victory.

622
00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.200
He holds the keys to victory over sin.

623
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.000
over evil

624
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:34.800
and even death

625
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.300
God will crush the enemies of his children.

626
00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.300
Sometimes God's victories.

627
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.500
over our enemies

628
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.400
They come quick.

629
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.400
They seem immediate.

630
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.100
Sometimes they're going to be slow.

631
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.300
and even some

632
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.800
they may come after death.

633
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.600
After we're gone.

634
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.800
But he will always Deliver Us.

635
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.500
But he's going to do it in his time and his way.

636
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.100
But it's always going to be for our good.

637
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.700
When we are faced with trouble and are desperate for Rescue.

638
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.900
We can have confidence.

639
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.800
to boldly

640
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.400
cry out

641
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600
in jesus' name

642
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.300
we can pray for him to deliver us

643
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.700
for from our enemies.

644
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.200
after all

645
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.500
Jesus taught us in Matthew 6:13

646
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.200
to pray

647
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.200
Deliver Us

648
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.100
From the evil one.

649
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:52.800
We can also.

650
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.300
Call to our memory.

651
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.300
all the examples

652
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.200
of how God has delivered his people

653
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.700
Moses in the Red Sea Daniel from the Lion's Den

654
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.400
Shadrach Meshach and Abednego from the fiery furnace.

655
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.800
Paul too many times to count

656
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.300
and Peter who Peter from drowning

657
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.300
and so many more

658
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.500
the idea is this

659
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.700
God is our savior. He's our rescuer.

660
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:28.800
He's Our Redeemer.

661
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.300
He's also our Lord.

662
00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.200
And he's in control.

663
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.000
If you're like me, you're quick to forget.

664
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.100
You're quick to forget the ways that God is delivered you.

665
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.700
Maybe we should think more often.

666
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.100
About when God has delivered us.

667
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.700
When he's preserved us.

668
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.300
and when he saved us

669
00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.300
for those of you who may not have a saving relationship with our

670
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:00.600
Lord.

671
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.600
Just yet. You're still seeking still asking

672
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:05.900
questions.

673
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.500
I would offer you this.

674
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.200
This Psalm is a perfect.

675
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.600
example of the good news of Salvation that

676
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.600
Jesus offers to those who

677
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.300
receive it

678
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.700
we're all in trouble and surrounded by the consequences of

679
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.900
our very own sin.

680
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.500
But God through Jesus Paid the death paid the

681
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.200
penalty.

682
00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.300
For sin for my sin and

683
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:40.900
for yours.

684
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.000
He provided a way to be rescued.

685
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.100
by God once and for all

686
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.200
just like David.

687
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.600
We are all in a desperate situation because of our sin.

688
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:55.900
every one of us

689
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.600
Jesus is the only one who can save us.

690
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.300
If you'd like to know more about how Jesus can become your

691
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.500
lord and savior find one of our elders or our

692
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.200
staff or or maybe even if you came with

693
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.400
somebody have a conversation with them ask the questions.

694
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.900
I'm sure that they would love to talk to you.

695
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.100
As we close and the band is going to come out. I want

696
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.400
us all to do something together. Okay?

697
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.700
You can put away your Bibles.

698
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.300
And I'm going to have everybody bow their

699
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:32.500
heads.

700
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.200
I want each one of us to take some time.

701
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.000
Just a minute.

702
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:47.700
and reflect

703
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.200
on a time when

704
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.400
God is rescued you.

705
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.900
Bow your head close your eyes.

706
00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.200
Focus your attention on God

707
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.900
it might have been your moment of salvation.

708
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.000
It might have been when he delivered you from addiction.

709
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.400
It might have been from physical danger or emotional Danger.

710
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.200
or

711
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.200
maybe you're under attack right now.

712
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.600
And you need his help.

713
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.900
Thank God for how he's delivered you.

714
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.200
and remember

715
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.500
that you can ask God for deliverance from your

716
00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.100
attacker.

717
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.900
And you can have confidence that he is going to deliver.
