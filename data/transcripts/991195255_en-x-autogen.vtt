00:00:01.275 --> 00:00:03.605
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:06.805
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.565
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:13.925
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:17.085
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:30.165
Well, amen. And good morning. My name is Mark Kellerman.

7
00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:31.965
I'm the residency director here.

8
00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:35.005
And uh, gosh, I'd rather not stop.

9
00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:37.125
I'd like to continue

10
00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:40.925
to bask in the holiness and the glory of God.

11
00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:42.445
So why don't we just do that for a moment.

12
00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:43.885
Let me pray for us one more time.

13
00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:48.805
Almighty God, again, we thank you for the truths

14
00:00:48.955 --> 00:00:50.325
that we have just sung.

15
00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.645
We thank you Lord for the glory

16
00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:55.165
that you are and that you have.

17
00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:59.205
Thank you Lord, that you would condescend to come

18
00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:02.325
to a place like this filled with a room, filled

19
00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:03.565
with people like us,

20
00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:08.525
and that you would move in our hearts, that you would speak

21
00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:10.685
to us, that you would address us,

22
00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:12.405
that you would have your way with us,

23
00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.605
that you would be revealed to us was.

24
00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:19.815
And God, we just respond in worship.

25
00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:24.455
We say that we love you, we honor you.

26
00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:29.295
And Lord, we want it to be with more than just our mouths.

27
00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:33.015
We pray that our lives would continually be changed

28
00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:37.975
to reflect you in worship, that our lives would be lived

29
00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:39.535
for your glory and honor.

30
00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:44.915
And Lord, we thank you for your mercy in our lives.

31
00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:46.035
Thank you for the words

32
00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:49.515
that we'll consider here in your holy and written word.

33
00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:50.635
And I pray you would speak it

34
00:01:51.295 --> 00:01:53.795
to us now in Jesus mighty name.

35
00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:56.835
Amen. Well, if you have a Bible,

36
00:01:56.835 --> 00:01:59.155
please join me in the book of Psalms.

37
00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:02.675
We're continuing our series in the book of Psalms

38
00:02:02.675 --> 00:02:04.995
and we're at Psalm chapter 74.

39
00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:09.115
And as you turn there, lemme just ask a couple of questions

40
00:02:09.135 --> 00:02:10.835
to kind of get us started.

41
00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:15.075
First off, I would just say, have you ever faced trials

42
00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:18.435
or struggles that just wouldn't go away

43
00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:22.035
in your journey with God?

44
00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:26.515
Are there questions that linger and even at times haunt you?

45
00:02:27.535 --> 00:02:29.595
You know, we love to hear the stories

46
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.515
of God at work in the world around us.

47
00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:33.075
We call them testimonies.

48
00:02:33.075 --> 00:02:35.355
We love to hear the ways in which God is saved

49
00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:36.915
and redeemed and rescued.

50
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:40.715
But what we find difficult is life

51
00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.635
between the problem and the remedy.

52
00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:49.155
And we need to have eyes of faith even in those moments

53
00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:53.955
when the answer has not yet arrived to our prayers

54
00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:55.035
and to our pleading.

55
00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:59.245
Perhaps you're troubled by the world around you,

56
00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.645
the culture at large

57
00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:04.845
that is on full blast in rebellion against God.

58
00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:08.485
And we wonder, does God see that? What is his reply?

59
00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:12.205
And it burdens us, I think at times.

60
00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:15.845
So if that's you, if, if you can relate to any of that,

61
00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:19.005
then I think Psalm 74 will be a helpful guide.

62
00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:22.965
In fact, I would encourage you to view Psalm 74 as a bit

63
00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:27.285
of a tour guide along that journey as we seek

64
00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:31.445
to trust God in uncertain and dangerous

65
00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:34.725
and at times difficult and dark times.

66
00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:40.525
So in this chapter in Psalm 74, we encounter

67
00:03:41.645 --> 00:03:45.205
a man, the author, the Psalmist Asaf,

68
00:03:46.105 --> 00:03:50.645
and he's grieved and he's overwhelmed by his circumstances.

69
00:03:51.515 --> 00:03:53.365
He's unsure about the future.

70
00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:58.085
He can see clearly the problems of the past and the present.

71
00:03:58.665 --> 00:04:00.965
And he's asking God to intervene.

72
00:04:01.545 --> 00:04:04.045
And it begins with this sort of potent cry.

73
00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:08.245
We read in the first line, Psalm 74, verse one.

74
00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:10.125
He says, oh God, why?

75
00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:15.565
Why do you cast us off forever?

76
00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:20.085
Why does your anger smoke against the

77
00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.965
sheep of your pasture?

78
00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:26.045
Now this psalm is similar to Psalm 73,

79
00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:28.005
which we saw last week.

80
00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:30.645
And then also as we continue into the future,

81
00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:33.645
Psalm 79 when we arrived there,

82
00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:38.085
actually these are very similar cries and prayers

83
00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:41.285
and Psalms, indeed, we, as we've seen the book

84
00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:43.685
of Psalms are, is the book of p songs.

85
00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:46.765
These are the prayers and the p songs of God's people.

86
00:04:46.825 --> 00:04:49.805
But a, as we get there, uh, the,

87
00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:53.565
the thing I wanna consider in this chapter is that,

88
00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:55.365
you know, we're not able, we just don't have time

89
00:04:55.385 --> 00:04:58.885
to wr out all of the various issues that arise,

90
00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:00.805
all the different things we wanna see

91
00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:02.685
and ask about this text.

92
00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:05.365
But the goal is to take it in as a whole.

93
00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:09.965
And, and my hope is that you'll come away with some handles

94
00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:14.045
and footholds on Psalm 74 when we're all done.

95
00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.925
So you might even think about it this way, great,

96
00:05:15.925 --> 00:05:18.245
if you're like me at all and like a visual learner

97
00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:21.285
and you think graphically, then think about it like this.

98
00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:25.205
So Psalm 74 is essentially exists in

99
00:05:25.205 --> 00:05:26.525
three main parts.

100
00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:28.885
So there's the beginning, the middle

101
00:05:28.985 --> 00:05:31.685
and the end, the first, second and third parts.

102
00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:33.965
Now the first part

103
00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:37.205
and the third part, like if you're reading downward,

104
00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:38.845
they are linked.

105
00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:40.965
If you're familiar with the way the internet works,

106
00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:42.925
you might call them hyperlinked.

107
00:05:43.705 --> 00:05:46.605
And this is a reflection of, you know,

108
00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:49.205
what Pastor John talked about several weeks ago.

109
00:05:49.695 --> 00:05:53.845
There is a Hebrew, uh, style of writing referred to

110
00:05:53.865 --> 00:05:54.965
as a chiasm.

111
00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:58.485
And this is a sort of layering of issues and points.

112
00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:00.645
So the top relates to the bottom

113
00:06:00.745 --> 00:06:02.525
and then differing, uh,

114
00:06:02.665 --> 00:06:05.165
layers within the text relate to each other.

115
00:06:05.435 --> 00:06:07.445
They're kind of linked in that way.

116
00:06:07.445 --> 00:06:09.205
You might think of concentric circles

117
00:06:09.205 --> 00:06:10.885
or the outlines of a target

118
00:06:11.065 --> 00:06:13.725
and with a bullseye right in the center.

119
00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:16.845
But the way that I want you to think about it,

120
00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:18.605
and I think this is helpful to me

121
00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:21.765
to think about Psalm 74 this way, is

122
00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:24.645
to picture it in your mind like scaling a mountain.

123
00:06:25.465 --> 00:06:27.725
And I've got this image here that I drew up.

124
00:06:27.725 --> 00:06:30.325
Hopefully it's helpful. What we see is that the psalm,

125
00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:34.005
first he beg the psalmist, he begins in the valley

126
00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:37.885
of his circumstances and problems

127
00:06:38.425 --> 00:06:42.285
and he's crying out to God in his grief, in his pain

128
00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:43.685
and in his despair.

129
00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:48.485
And then what he does is he shifts his focus away from his

130
00:06:48.485 --> 00:06:52.285
circumstances and his problems and he thinks about God

131
00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:54.445
and all of his glory and power

132
00:06:54.865 --> 00:06:56.725
and promises and his faithfulness.

133
00:06:58.465 --> 00:07:01.245
He meditates on God and he worships God.

134
00:07:02.425 --> 00:07:06.685
And then that becomes the catalyst for his ability

135
00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:09.525
to then descend back along the path,

136
00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:11.925
following his his journey

137
00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:15.845
and to descend back into those realities with confidence

138
00:07:16.145 --> 00:07:19.725
and faith and the ability to pray to God with boldness

139
00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:21.645
and to know that he would be heard.

140
00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:24.645
And so with that in mind, we get started in the first

141
00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:29.285
section, which also provides our introduction.

142
00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:31.685
Lemme just read the first three verses.

143
00:07:32.755 --> 00:07:36.615
Oh God, why do you cast us off forever?

144
00:07:38.245 --> 00:07:42.105
Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?

145
00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:47.505
Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old,

146
00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:51.625
which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your heritage.

147
00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:56.265
Remember Mount Zion where you have dwelt direct your steps

148
00:07:56.725 --> 00:08:01.705
to the perpetual ruins, the enemy has destroyed everything

149
00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:03.665
in the sanctuary.

150
00:08:04.925 --> 00:08:09.665
Do you hear the anguish in this man's words disaster

151
00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:14.865
had struck and Asaf he wrote with a sense of this terrible

152
00:08:15.385 --> 00:08:19.025
question, not only had God disciplined them in his judgment,

153
00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:21.385
but the fear that seems to be

154
00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:25.145
tangible in his words is this question,

155
00:08:25.565 --> 00:08:28.265
has God cast us off permanently?

156
00:08:29.365 --> 00:08:31.865
Has God perhaps abandoned us forever?

157
00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:35.865
Would this always be the case? Would he always be angry?

158
00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:40.665
Would his posture towards us be one of opposition forever?

159
00:08:43.915 --> 00:08:46.215
And I think the question here for him was,

160
00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:48.655
would his circumstance ever change?

161
00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:51.535
Because the only way they would was

162
00:08:51.675 --> 00:08:54.135
by the grace and the power of God.

163
00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:57.405
So he begins here with this question, why?

164
00:08:58.385 --> 00:09:01.845
And you know, I do take this why to be a bit more

165
00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:03.245
of a rhetorical question.

166
00:09:03.405 --> 00:09:07.005
I don't, I don't think that he's actually asking God to sort

167
00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.125
of enumerate the reasons.

168
00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:12.325
Like I don't think he would be satisfied by the Lord saying,

169
00:09:12.325 --> 00:09:15.845
well, okay, asap, let me tell you, there was, you know,

170
00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:19.285
let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 15 million.

171
00:09:19.345 --> 00:09:20.645
How many, how many things do you want?

172
00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:24.365
I don't think he's looking for an explanation.

173
00:09:24.685 --> 00:09:27.645
I think this is the hard cry of pain

174
00:09:28.065 --> 00:09:31.725
and of anguish of his own uncertainty.

175
00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:33.085
I think the reasons are clear.

176
00:09:33.085 --> 00:09:36.405
If you read the Bible and you know, uh, the back side

177
00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:38.525
of this story, which I'll mention a little more about in a

178
00:09:38.525 --> 00:09:41.285
moment, I think that the reality is

179
00:09:42.355 --> 00:09:46.405
that he is just expressing his sense of pain in the moment

180
00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:48.965
because of course God has not changed.

181
00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:51.845
It's just that the, uh, that circumstances

182
00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:54.165
they appear this way.

183
00:09:55.035 --> 00:09:56.965
It's like, I love what one author said.

184
00:09:56.965 --> 00:10:00.965
He said, this is the desperate, this is a desperate psalm,

185
00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:04.685
but it is not the song of an atheist.

186
00:10:05.675 --> 00:10:10.325
This is the psalm or the whale of the cry of a true

187
00:10:11.185 --> 00:10:12.845
but struggling believer.

188
00:10:13.725 --> 00:10:16.365
I mean, this guy wouldn't even be praying if he really

189
00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:17.645
believed God was not listening.

190
00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:19.605
He wouldn't even be praying if he thought

191
00:10:19.605 --> 00:10:20.885
that it was, it was pointless.

192
00:10:20.935 --> 00:10:22.405
There was no one there or

193
00:10:22.405 --> 00:10:25.205
that God was always had already determined against him.

194
00:10:25.435 --> 00:10:26.645
He's crying out to God

195
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:31.005
because he actually believes that he hears him.

196
00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:33.885
He actually believes that he is for him

197
00:10:34.585 --> 00:10:37.485
and that is why he is praying.

198
00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:39.805
And so in verses two and three, he calls on God

199
00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:42.605
to remember his people and his place

200
00:10:43.665 --> 00:10:45.085
and to do something about it.

201
00:10:45.085 --> 00:10:49.485
He says, direct your steps to the perpetual ruins.

202
00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:52.005
Run to our rescue.

203
00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:55.125
It's like pick up your feet and come our way.

204
00:10:57.165 --> 00:10:59.345
And this is how the psalm gets started in

205
00:10:59.495 --> 00:11:00.785
this is our first point.

206
00:11:01.325 --> 00:11:03.865
If you're following the outline, we see the psalmist,

207
00:11:03.865 --> 00:11:07.265
he grieves in loss and pain.

208
00:11:07.805 --> 00:11:10.025
And I think it's part of the lesson we take away is

209
00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:13.705
that it's right to grieve in our loss and pain.

210
00:11:13.705 --> 00:11:16.305
Sometimes we think it's a, it's a matter of faith.

211
00:11:16.365 --> 00:11:18.625
If we it's or it's a matter of unbelief.

212
00:11:19.165 --> 00:11:20.585
If we acknowledge our problems

213
00:11:20.585 --> 00:11:21.865
or we say, man, I have this issue

214
00:11:21.865 --> 00:11:23.385
or concern it, it's

215
00:11:24.025 --> 00:11:27.505
actually the only place you can begin if you're in the

216
00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:31.345
valley, the only way up is to recognize

217
00:11:31.435 --> 00:11:32.865
where you are on the map.

218
00:11:33.565 --> 00:11:36.265
So we grieve in our loss, in our pain.

219
00:11:36.685 --> 00:11:39.265
Let me continue as we read in verses three to nine,

220
00:11:41.525 --> 00:11:44.585
direct your steps to the perpetual ruins.

221
00:11:45.365 --> 00:11:48.425
The enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary.

222
00:11:49.255 --> 00:11:53.065
Your foes have roared in the midst of your meeting place,

223
00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:57.045
they set up their own signs for signs.

224
00:11:57.475 --> 00:12:00.725
They've come in and they've redecorated their symbols,

225
00:12:00.725 --> 00:12:03.605
their banners, their flags, they put them everywhere

226
00:12:03.865 --> 00:12:05.525
and they've torn down the Lord's.

227
00:12:06.755 --> 00:12:10.605
They were like those who swing axes in a forest of trees

228
00:12:11.785 --> 00:12:13.085
in all its carved wood.

229
00:12:13.085 --> 00:12:15.525
They broke down with hatchets and hammers.

230
00:12:15.995 --> 00:12:17.965
They set your sanctuary on fire.

231
00:12:18.345 --> 00:12:21.685
The profane, they profane the dwelling place of your name,

232
00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:23.565
bringing it down to the ground.

233
00:12:23.565 --> 00:12:26.605
They're like lumberjacks just cutting down everything.

234
00:12:26.915 --> 00:12:29.805
They're like vandals going in and just destroying.

235
00:12:30.105 --> 00:12:33.245
As they went, they said to themselves,

236
00:12:34.425 --> 00:12:36.765
we will utterly subdue them.

237
00:12:37.395 --> 00:12:41.485
They burned all the meeting places of God in the land.

238
00:12:41.945 --> 00:12:44.325
We do not see our signs.

239
00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:46.845
There is no longer any prophet

240
00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:52.605
and there is none among us who knows how long.

241
00:12:55.745 --> 00:12:58.965
The context to what's going on in this psalm,

242
00:12:58.985 --> 00:13:03.725
the background if you will, is that God had rescued

243
00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.605
and redeemed the people of Israel out

244
00:13:06.605 --> 00:13:07.845
of all the nations of the earth.

245
00:13:08.665 --> 00:13:11.005
And he had called them to himself.

246
00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:13.405
And he did that for a very specific reason.

247
00:13:13.935 --> 00:13:18.605
First and foremost, this was the family to whom he was going

248
00:13:18.605 --> 00:13:22.285
to bring the savior of the world into the world.

249
00:13:23.065 --> 00:13:25.765
He was going to come from this race of people,

250
00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:28.325
but among them as a nation.

251
00:13:29.145 --> 00:13:32.285
The goal and the desire of God for them was that

252
00:13:32.505 --> 00:13:34.725
as he said in so many different ways, you are a,

253
00:13:35.025 --> 00:13:37.485
you are a holy, you are a chosen people,

254
00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.485
you are a royal priesthood.

255
00:13:40.605 --> 00:13:43.725
A holy nation called out of darkness into light the idea.

256
00:13:43.825 --> 00:13:48.045
So even in the people of Israel, they had priests

257
00:13:48.675 --> 00:13:52.645
that represented God to them as a people.

258
00:13:53.505 --> 00:13:55.365
But this comment here that they were called

259
00:13:55.365 --> 00:13:59.245
to be a holy priesthood as a nation, reflects the fact

260
00:13:59.245 --> 00:14:02.325
that they were called to represent God

261
00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:04.325
to the nations of the world.

262
00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:06.205
They were called to represent the

263
00:14:06.205 --> 00:14:07.445
nations of the world to God.

264
00:14:07.665 --> 00:14:10.885
And so their role in part were priests of God most high

265
00:14:10.945 --> 00:14:12.005
to represent him.

266
00:14:12.465 --> 00:14:15.165
And that was a very much a part of their calling,

267
00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:18.125
God's reason for drawing them out of the nations.

268
00:14:20.305 --> 00:14:23.325
But the Jewish people had rebelled against God.

269
00:14:23.835 --> 00:14:28.045
They had reengaged in gross immorality and idolatry

270
00:14:28.185 --> 00:14:32.885
and sin for generations after generation after generation.

271
00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:36.565
And God had warned them and he had wooed them

272
00:14:36.905 --> 00:14:40.565
and he had threatened them and yet they had scorned him.

273
00:14:40.595 --> 00:14:43.845
They had scoffed at him and they had ridiculed him.

274
00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.485
And at this point, God's patience had worn out.

275
00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:52.925
And when it came, his judgment reigned down hard

276
00:14:53.545 --> 00:14:55.325
on the people of Israel.

277
00:14:56.835 --> 00:14:58.375
The result was that the wicked

278
00:14:59.105 --> 00:15:02.135
pagan Babylonians had triumphed over God's people,

279
00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:04.815
slaughtering and enslaving them.

280
00:15:05.555 --> 00:15:07.895
All that they had known and loved have been lost.

281
00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:11.055
And at this point in Psalm 74, it appears

282
00:15:11.365 --> 00:15:13.495
that likely even years had passed

283
00:15:14.275 --> 00:15:16.575
and they were wondering what the future held.

284
00:15:17.235 --> 00:15:21.655
God seemed silent and there appeared to be no end in sight

285
00:15:21.715 --> 00:15:24.415
and no remedy possible.

286
00:15:25.045 --> 00:15:27.855
Jerusalem had been invaded, the temple destroyed

287
00:15:27.855 --> 00:15:29.775
and the people conquered.

288
00:15:30.245 --> 00:15:33.335
This was their circums, excuse me,

289
00:15:33.335 --> 00:15:34.695
this was their circumstance.

290
00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:38.575
This was the valley of their realities

291
00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:40.415
and of their situation.

292
00:15:41.125 --> 00:15:43.215
This section concludes in verses 10 through 11.

293
00:15:43.385 --> 00:15:47.335
Again, we hear this refrain, how long,

294
00:15:47.635 --> 00:15:49.375
oh God the foe.

295
00:15:49.395 --> 00:15:52.815
How long is the foe to scoff is the enemy

296
00:15:52.835 --> 00:15:54.495
to revile your name forever?

297
00:15:55.875 --> 00:15:58.735
Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?

298
00:15:59.445 --> 00:16:02.015
That is like biblically the sword, hand the sword,

299
00:16:02.075 --> 00:16:03.375
the the hand of power

300
00:16:03.635 --> 00:16:08.135
and of action, take it out of the fold of your garment

301
00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:10.055
and destroy them.

302
00:16:10.195 --> 00:16:14.295
Excuse me, God's patience.

303
00:16:14.435 --> 00:16:19.055
Um, sorry. And so here, this is an impassioned prayer

304
00:16:19.235 --> 00:16:21.975
for God to hurry up and to defend his people.

305
00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:25.975
I think ASAP represents the remnant of God's people.

306
00:16:26.765 --> 00:16:29.335
He's not one that has been a rebellion against God

307
00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:32.295
or he has come to repentance for that.

308
00:16:32.675 --> 00:16:36.215
But he is among those who still believe in God

309
00:16:36.435 --> 00:16:38.535
and are left with the consequences of

310
00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:39.775
what other people has done.

311
00:16:40.075 --> 00:16:42.975
And yet he is dealing with it nonetheless.

312
00:16:44.825 --> 00:16:46.685
And there's two main things that are at stake

313
00:16:46.795 --> 00:16:50.805
that we hear over and again as he asks this, how long

314
00:16:50.985 --> 00:16:54.085
and why and cause God to act as we see

315
00:16:54.315 --> 00:16:57.045
that his circumstances are in his mind,

316
00:16:57.555 --> 00:16:59.165
he's asking God to intervene.

317
00:16:59.545 --> 00:17:02.725
And then also we repeatedly see

318
00:17:02.725 --> 00:17:05.445
that he is concerned about the honor

319
00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:07.605
of God among the nations.

320
00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:12.045
That God's name is being defamed because of these things.

321
00:17:12.145 --> 00:17:14.565
And that is one of his concerns.

322
00:17:16.025 --> 00:17:19.445
So this is what the psalmist grieves,

323
00:17:20.155 --> 00:17:22.605
this is his location on the map.

324
00:17:22.985 --> 00:17:25.685
And this brings us to our second point, which is,

325
00:17:25.685 --> 00:17:28.005
if you're following the outline, it is that we believe

326
00:17:28.745 --> 00:17:30.845
in eternal realities.

327
00:17:32.025 --> 00:17:36.685
So just listen here as we enter into this next section, how

328
00:17:37.285 --> 00:17:39.285
dramatically the tune changes

329
00:17:40.505 --> 00:17:44.005
as we rise up from the valley of discouragement

330
00:17:44.425 --> 00:17:48.925
and soar into the heights of who God is and what he is like

331
00:17:49.225 --> 00:17:51.285
and what he has done.

332
00:17:51.545 --> 00:17:55.925
We read about it beginning in verse 12, yet

333
00:17:56.985 --> 00:17:58.765
God, my king is from

334
00:17:58.765 --> 00:18:02.285
of old working salvation in the midst of the earth.

335
00:18:02.705 --> 00:18:05.445
He begins by saying He yet or

336
00:18:06.345 --> 00:18:08.245
but is another thing he might say.

337
00:18:08.825 --> 00:18:10.325
He says all that's true.

338
00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:13.965
But this also is true.

339
00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:16.965
He says to himself, there is something else

340
00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:19.285
that I need to consider.

341
00:18:20.185 --> 00:18:22.445
And here he shifts from his circumstances

342
00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:26.885
and he calls to mind these things that are true about God.

343
00:18:27.775 --> 00:18:31.085
God's glory and power, his acts

344
00:18:31.265 --> 00:18:35.885
of power in the past, his promises about the present

345
00:18:36.505 --> 00:18:39.365
and the future is Colossians three,

346
00:18:39.385 --> 00:18:43.205
two said He's actively setting his mind on things

347
00:18:43.235 --> 00:18:44.525
that are above.

348
00:18:45.785 --> 00:18:48.685
And we continue and read after verse 12.

349
00:18:48.865 --> 00:18:53.525
Yet God, my king is from of old working salvation.

350
00:18:53.785 --> 00:18:55.005
In the midst of the earth,

351
00:18:55.905 --> 00:18:58.245
you divided the sea by your might.

352
00:18:58.865 --> 00:19:02.085
You broke the heads of the sea, monsters on the waters,

353
00:19:02.825 --> 00:19:07.045
you crush the heads of leviathan, you gave him his food

354
00:19:07.145 --> 00:19:08.645
for the creatures of the wilderness.

355
00:19:09.265 --> 00:19:11.685
You split open springs in Brooks,

356
00:19:12.145 --> 00:19:14.285
you dried up ever flowing streams.

357
00:19:15.095 --> 00:19:17.005
Yours is the day yours also,

358
00:19:17.025 --> 00:19:19.845
the night you have established the heavenly

359
00:19:19.845 --> 00:19:21.245
lights and the sun.

360
00:19:21.945 --> 00:19:24.365
You have fixed all the boundaries of the earth.

361
00:19:25.025 --> 00:19:28.405
You have made the summer and the winter.

362
00:19:30.225 --> 00:19:33.365
In the first section, the first 11 verses

363
00:19:34.145 --> 00:19:37.925
the psalmist calls God to remember, he calls on God

364
00:19:37.925 --> 00:19:41.485
and says, oh God, remember your people, remember your place.

365
00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:46.965
Remember your promises. And here he shifts gears

366
00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:48.725
and he calls on himself.

367
00:19:49.465 --> 00:19:53.045
He calls on his people to remember God.

368
00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:55.605
He says, oh God, remember us.

369
00:19:55.785 --> 00:19:56.925
And then now he shifts gears

370
00:19:57.065 --> 00:20:00.605
and he says, oh us remember God.

371
00:20:01.945 --> 00:20:05.645
And this is an essential aspect for us for prayer.

372
00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:09.725
Anytime we are wrestling with something that is unknown

373
00:20:09.825 --> 00:20:12.445
or uncertain or difficult or hard

374
00:20:12.465 --> 00:20:14.765
or bringing us down, we call on God.

375
00:20:15.145 --> 00:20:19.325
God remember me, but we must call on ourselves

376
00:20:19.865 --> 00:20:22.405
to also remember God.

377
00:20:23.465 --> 00:20:26.085
God, my king is from of old. Verse 12.

378
00:20:26.265 --> 00:20:29.925
He is sovereign, reigning, timeless,

379
00:20:30.555 --> 00:20:33.445
working salvation in the midst of the earth he is saving,

380
00:20:34.345 --> 00:20:36.405
acting, intervening.

381
00:20:37.345 --> 00:20:39.965
As this section continues, he's seen as creator,

382
00:20:40.835 --> 00:20:42.445
sustainer, and savior.

383
00:20:42.745 --> 00:20:46.845
And the psalmist is calling all of these things to mind.

384
00:20:47.905 --> 00:20:51.805
The examples that he lists here, I think seem to come to me.

385
00:20:52.115 --> 00:20:56.845
They come from examples, from the exodus of his establishing

386
00:20:56.845 --> 00:20:59.165
of his people delivering them out of bondage

387
00:20:59.185 --> 00:21:02.405
to slavery in Egypt and also God's act

388
00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:04.605
and power in creation.

389
00:21:05.145 --> 00:21:07.965
He parted the sea, I think possibly the Red Sea

390
00:21:08.145 --> 00:21:09.245
during the Exodus.

391
00:21:09.505 --> 00:21:13.165
It was his power over the great monsters on land and sea.

392
00:21:13.835 --> 00:21:15.165
This can be taken different ways,

393
00:21:15.225 --> 00:21:17.885
but I think it's symbolic for the powers of Egypt,

394
00:21:18.395 --> 00:21:20.205
both on land and in the sea.

395
00:21:20.395 --> 00:21:23.045
When he parted the waters and they were rescued

396
00:21:23.105 --> 00:21:25.925
and then rained down the ocean upon their enemies,

397
00:21:27.215 --> 00:21:29.595
he split open springs and Brooks,

398
00:21:30.125 --> 00:21:31.795
after they passed through the wilderness

399
00:21:31.795 --> 00:21:33.435
before entering in the promised land,

400
00:21:33.705 --> 00:21:36.555
they crossed the Jordan on dry land

401
00:21:36.945 --> 00:21:40.035
because it also parted before them.

402
00:21:41.635 --> 00:21:44.275
Likewise. So he dried up streams, he

403
00:21:44.515 --> 00:21:45.875
provided water in the wilderness.

404
00:21:46.615 --> 00:21:49.715
He owns the day as well as the night.

405
00:21:50.695 --> 00:21:52.555
He made all the planets.

406
00:21:52.815 --> 00:21:56.235
He made the moon and all the moons, the stars,

407
00:21:56.455 --> 00:21:58.035
the asteroids and meteors.

408
00:21:58.415 --> 00:22:02.555
He made black holes every dimension, whether it's seen

409
00:22:02.975 --> 00:22:07.795
or unseen, he made nebula, corks and quasars and asteroids.

410
00:22:08.255 --> 00:22:10.635
He set the boundaries to space and time

411
00:22:11.135 --> 00:22:13.755
and the laws of physics he dreamed up

412
00:22:14.095 --> 00:22:16.795
and put into place geology and weather

413
00:22:17.015 --> 00:22:20.835
and nature, God's power and ownership in

414
00:22:20.935 --> 00:22:22.355
and over all things.

415
00:22:24.615 --> 00:22:26.715
And this is the God he calls to mind.

416
00:22:28.085 --> 00:22:31.745
He says, God, call, remember me, remember us.

417
00:22:32.245 --> 00:22:35.385
But he says to himself, oh God, oh, oh me, oh us.

418
00:22:36.825 --> 00:22:39.105
Remember, this is our God.

419
00:22:40.605 --> 00:22:43.965
I love this quote by g Campbell Morgan from

420
00:22:44.085 --> 00:22:45.125
a generation ago.

421
00:22:45.225 --> 00:22:48.645
He says, talk, he's commenting on Psalm 74.

422
00:22:48.665 --> 00:22:52.965
He says, things could hardly be worse to the eyes

423
00:22:53.185 --> 00:22:55.605
of sight, human sight, the first part.

424
00:22:56.105 --> 00:22:59.525
And then came the declaration of what the eyes of faith

425
00:23:00.425 --> 00:23:03.845
beheld the second part, in spite

426
00:23:03.845 --> 00:23:07.325
of all the seeming apparent contradictions, God was seen

427
00:23:07.325 --> 00:23:09.405
as king working in salvation.

428
00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:13.525
And then he says, further, the man of faith is never blind

429
00:23:14.265 --> 00:23:16.925
to the desolation, the problems.

430
00:23:17.585 --> 00:23:21.605
We don't pretend we don't see them. No, we see them clearly.

431
00:23:21.865 --> 00:23:26.645
We see all the terrible facts. But he sees more than that.

432
00:23:27.585 --> 00:23:32.285
He sees God. Therefore his last word is never desolation.

433
00:23:33.065 --> 00:23:35.965
His last word is always salvation.

434
00:23:36.505 --> 00:23:39.525
And we see this happening in Psalm 74.

435
00:23:39.645 --> 00:23:42.005
I love what this other author I read said, he said,

436
00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:45.685
what the psalmist believes here begins to engage

437
00:23:45.755 --> 00:23:46.925
what he grieves.

438
00:23:47.905 --> 00:23:50.405
And that makes all the difference as he begins

439
00:23:50.405 --> 00:23:54.205
to encourage himself with these eternal realities.

440
00:23:54.265 --> 00:23:56.845
God is great and God is good.

441
00:23:56.905 --> 00:24:00.405
And we need that kind of clarity when we face the struggles

442
00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:03.085
and the trials and the mockery

443
00:24:03.105 --> 00:24:06.245
and the uncertainty that we encounter in the world.

444
00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:11.725
So this is where we see asap, beginning

445
00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:16.365
to scale the heights of God's glory and power and promises.

446
00:24:16.745 --> 00:24:19.405
Um, I've got a picture of a mountain view

447
00:24:19.745 --> 00:24:22.085
of this is overlooking.

448
00:24:22.265 --> 00:24:24.405
So, so you know, if you've ever climbed a mountain,

449
00:24:25.235 --> 00:24:27.285
then you know it can be hard to get there,

450
00:24:27.285 --> 00:24:29.245
especially if it's tall, high, big one.

451
00:24:30.425 --> 00:24:32.965
And yeah, and sometimes even along the way you might feel

452
00:24:32.965 --> 00:24:34.885
like, I'm not sure that

453
00:24:34.905 --> 00:24:36.125
I'm actually gonna make it to the top.

454
00:24:36.705 --> 00:24:39.285
But here's what happens when you come out there,

455
00:24:39.355 --> 00:24:42.525
when you scale the heights in this regard,

456
00:24:42.525 --> 00:24:44.085
when you think about the glory of God

457
00:24:44.085 --> 00:24:45.485
and you force yourself

458
00:24:45.505 --> 00:24:47.525
to take your eyes off your circumstances

459
00:24:47.865 --> 00:24:51.125
and to fix them squarely on God is you reach a place

460
00:24:51.135 --> 00:24:54.885
where you can actually see more than you thought was there.

461
00:24:55.985 --> 00:24:58.325
You, there's so much you take in from

462
00:24:58.325 --> 00:24:59.565
that kind of a vantage point.

463
00:24:59.825 --> 00:25:01.285
You can see where you've been.

464
00:25:02.105 --> 00:25:04.525
In fact, you see things you walked right by

465
00:25:04.525 --> 00:25:05.765
and didn't even know they were there.

466
00:25:06.465 --> 00:25:08.605
And then you can see all the journey along the way

467
00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:10.765
and you can also see where you're going

468
00:25:11.665 --> 00:25:12.805
and you see what's ahead.

469
00:25:12.865 --> 00:25:14.685
And even though it's hard and by the end

470
00:25:14.685 --> 00:25:17.725
of the journey typically you're far more tired than when you

471
00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:19.685
started, it's downhill from there.

472
00:25:20.715 --> 00:25:22.805
It's all downhill. And you have perspective,

473
00:25:23.205 --> 00:25:24.645
a vantage, you have vision.

474
00:25:25.465 --> 00:25:29.165
And it enables you to descend back into the realities

475
00:25:29.165 --> 00:25:31.165
of your struggles and your problems

476
00:25:31.165 --> 00:25:33.485
and your life with faith and confidence.

477
00:25:33.485 --> 00:25:36.045
Knowing where you are, knowing where you're going.

478
00:25:39.585 --> 00:25:43.045
And this is the thing that I think fuels our faith.

479
00:25:43.745 --> 00:25:46.405
And we see this in Psalm 74, again, as the,

480
00:25:46.505 --> 00:25:48.765
as the psalmist is setting his mind

481
00:25:49.545 --> 00:25:50.965
on things that are above.

482
00:25:51.085 --> 00:25:52.685
I wanna encourage you when you're in this moment,

483
00:25:53.145 --> 00:25:56.885
to just take the time to enumerate the glory of God.

484
00:25:57.665 --> 00:26:00.925
You can flip through your Bible, ransack your Bible, looking

485
00:26:00.945 --> 00:26:04.445
for the glory of God, the acts of God, the promises of God.

486
00:26:04.865 --> 00:26:07.605
If it helps pick up a theology about God

487
00:26:07.665 --> 00:26:10.285
and read the nature of who he is and what he's like.

488
00:26:10.285 --> 00:26:11.485
Think about all that he's done

489
00:26:12.465 --> 00:26:15.645
and indeed all that he is going to do.

490
00:26:17.385 --> 00:26:19.805
We see this in Psalm 74.

491
00:26:20.985 --> 00:26:25.765
We are not blind to trouble problems or our pain

492
00:26:25.905 --> 00:26:30.405
or circumstances, but sometimes we are blinded by them.

493
00:26:31.345 --> 00:26:33.845
And we need to have the spiritual vision

494
00:26:34.065 --> 00:26:38.525
and sight to see God, to see more than what is going on.

495
00:26:38.525 --> 00:26:39.805
It reminds me of an old song,

496
00:26:40.245 --> 00:26:41.365
I think it's called Lead of Love.

497
00:26:41.385 --> 00:26:43.965
It said, I had to walk through through the rocks

498
00:26:44.425 --> 00:26:45.725
to see the mountain view.

499
00:26:45.825 --> 00:26:48.925
But looking back, what I see is I see the lead of love.

500
00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:52.685
I see God leading me even when it was hard.

501
00:26:54.025 --> 00:26:56.285
So here at this point, the psalmist is better equipped

502
00:26:56.305 --> 00:26:58.165
to reengage his realities

503
00:26:58.465 --> 00:27:01.365
and he comes back down at them in faith.

504
00:27:01.555 --> 00:27:03.085
It's like what one author said,

505
00:27:03.085 --> 00:27:06.005
that worship is the solution to our problems.

506
00:27:06.115 --> 00:27:08.285
Worship is the answer to our questions.

507
00:27:08.305 --> 00:27:12.605
It is the catalyst for confident prayer, and

508
00:27:12.605 --> 00:27:16.885
therefore we want to approach God this way so

509
00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:19.245
that we can be fueled in our faith in that regard.

510
00:27:19.545 --> 00:27:23.445
Our second point is that we believe eternal realities.

511
00:27:23.865 --> 00:27:28.125
So now this brings us to our last section in Psalm 74,

512
00:27:28.225 --> 00:27:30.845
and it's verses 18 to the end.

513
00:27:30.905 --> 00:27:34.085
And let's read it. Uh, if you wanna follow along,

514
00:27:34.365 --> 00:27:39.005
re remember this, oh Lord, how the enemy scoffs

515
00:27:39.705 --> 00:27:42.125
and a foolish people reviles your name.

516
00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:46.125
Do not deliver the soul of your dove, his people

517
00:27:46.385 --> 00:27:47.405
to the wild beast.

518
00:27:47.825 --> 00:27:50.485
Do not forget the life of your poor forever.

519
00:27:51.555 --> 00:27:54.125
Have regard for the covenant, for the dark.

520
00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:58.485
Places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.

521
00:27:59.745 --> 00:28:02.725
Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame.

522
00:28:03.705 --> 00:28:07.645
Let the poor and needy praise your name, arise.

523
00:28:07.905 --> 00:28:09.605
Oh God, defend your cause.

524
00:28:10.685 --> 00:28:13.085
Remember how the foolish scoff at you all the day.

525
00:28:14.225 --> 00:28:19.165
Do not forget the clamor of your foes, the uproar of those

526
00:28:19.265 --> 00:28:23.805
who rise up against you, which goes up continually.

527
00:28:25.265 --> 00:28:30.085
So 10 times in these six verses, the psalmist calls on God

528
00:28:30.425 --> 00:28:33.885
to save God's people and to defend his honor.

529
00:28:34.225 --> 00:28:35.405
And he does so like this.

530
00:28:35.425 --> 00:28:38.765
He says, remember the scoffing and reviling.

531
00:28:39.745 --> 00:28:43.085
Do not abandon us or forget us.

532
00:28:43.915 --> 00:28:46.085
Have regard for your covenant promises.

533
00:28:46.105 --> 00:28:49.565
Let us not turn back in shame. Let the poor and needy us.

534
00:28:49.835 --> 00:28:53.485
Pray your name arise, defend your cause.

535
00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:57.085
Remember, do not forget the scoffing

536
00:28:57.305 --> 00:29:01.725
and reviling, the reason that we can pray prayers like that.

537
00:29:01.785 --> 00:29:05.285
And the reason the psalmist prays like that is

538
00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:08.325
because he knows that God hears him.

539
00:29:09.145 --> 00:29:14.125
He knows that God is aware, he knows that God remembers.

540
00:29:15.145 --> 00:29:19.485
And he knows that God can and will act to rescue

541
00:29:20.105 --> 00:29:24.125
and redeem and to restore him and his people.

542
00:29:27.045 --> 00:29:29.385
And so this is where our third point, uh, this is

543
00:29:29.385 --> 00:29:30.465
where we come in our outline.

544
00:29:30.605 --> 00:29:34.585
The third point is that we plead with God to intervene.

545
00:29:34.685 --> 00:29:36.065
We grieve our circumstances.

546
00:29:36.645 --> 00:29:39.665
We believe in the truth about who God is.

547
00:29:39.725 --> 00:29:43.445
And we plead with God to intervene.

548
00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:45.405
There's a variety, all this variety

549
00:29:45.505 --> 00:29:49.805
of specific requests we could talk about, uh, at, at length.

550
00:29:50.265 --> 00:29:53.925
But this psalm ends here with a bit of tension in the air.

551
00:29:54.105 --> 00:29:55.605
And I kinda wanna highlight that for us.

552
00:29:56.025 --> 00:30:00.165
Um, you know, on the one hand at this point,

553
00:30:00.705 --> 00:30:02.845
the psalmist, okay, so if you just think about

554
00:30:03.545 --> 00:30:04.885
that's the end of the psalm.

555
00:30:05.825 --> 00:30:08.045
And and there's really not a resolution

556
00:30:09.015 --> 00:30:13.205
other than he has started where he was, he ascended

557
00:30:13.205 --> 00:30:17.485
to the glory of God and then he pray confidently in boldly.

558
00:30:18.345 --> 00:30:20.885
And yet in the Psalm itself, there's not

559
00:30:21.405 --> 00:30:24.965
actually a resolution beyond that other than the confidence

560
00:30:24.965 --> 00:30:29.605
that he is heard, that God knows that God can

561
00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:30.765
and will act.

562
00:30:33.135 --> 00:30:36.075
Now we do know, of course, as we look at the history

563
00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:37.635
that we read in the Bible,

564
00:30:37.695 --> 00:30:39.875
and we know the story of what God had did in the world,

565
00:30:40.375 --> 00:30:43.275
we know that this man's prayers were all answered.

566
00:30:43.635 --> 00:30:45.595
I don't know if it all came the way he pictured it

567
00:30:45.775 --> 00:30:48.755
or if it all happened in his lifetime, but God rescued

568
00:30:48.755 --> 00:30:49.755
and redeemed his people.

569
00:30:50.095 --> 00:30:51.275
The temple was rebuilt.

570
00:30:51.575 --> 00:30:55.115
And so much so that enough time elapsed that again,

571
00:30:55.415 --> 00:30:57.355
the people of Israel rebelled against God.

572
00:30:57.615 --> 00:30:59.355
And again, the temple was destroyed.

573
00:30:59.775 --> 00:31:01.435
So in our past

574
00:31:02.095 --> 00:31:05.875
and in his future, God answered this man's prayers.

575
00:31:05.895 --> 00:31:09.355
But there is that uncertainty left in the Psalm itself.

576
00:31:11.095 --> 00:31:12.545
Another thing is that I think that

577
00:31:12.825 --> 00:31:14.785
whenever we read a psalm like this,

578
00:31:15.725 --> 00:31:17.345
it it can be sort of uncomfortable.

579
00:31:17.345 --> 00:31:19.345
Like, I'll be honest, when I first read through this, I,

580
00:31:19.425 --> 00:31:21.505
I felt like, man, this is a little depressing.

581
00:31:22.135 --> 00:31:24.065
It's a little depressing to think so long

582
00:31:24.685 --> 00:31:27.665
and openly about these kinds of problems.

583
00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:30.945
But I think one thing that it does that is important for us

584
00:31:30.945 --> 00:31:32.705
to consider is

585
00:31:32.705 --> 00:31:36.985
that it challenges us at like a heart level, kind

586
00:31:36.985 --> 00:31:39.425
of the idolatries of our lives.

587
00:31:40.135 --> 00:31:42.785
What I mean by that is we see a person

588
00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:47.025
or a a people who have lost, uh, all sense of ease

589
00:31:47.445 --> 00:31:52.185
or comfort or prosperity or convenience or control

590
00:31:52.245 --> 00:31:53.425
or self-determination.

591
00:31:53.765 --> 00:31:57.185
And that threatens us as human beings. Like that's obvi.

592
00:31:57.245 --> 00:31:58.345
All those things are good things,

593
00:31:58.405 --> 00:32:02.985
but that's what idolatry is, is it's anything that we serve,

594
00:32:03.645 --> 00:32:04.785
uh, more than God.

595
00:32:05.445 --> 00:32:08.705
And so whenever we, I, at least for me, I read these things

596
00:32:08.765 --> 00:32:10.865
and I think we face a bit of

597
00:32:10.865 --> 00:32:12.785
that when we read a psalm like this

598
00:32:12.895 --> 00:32:14.585
because it feels threatening.

599
00:32:14.615 --> 00:32:17.865
It's like, man, uh, these things are hard and challenging.

600
00:32:17.985 --> 00:32:19.585
I want God to answer those prayers.

601
00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:23.465
But the question remains if I don't have them,

602
00:32:25.195 --> 00:32:26.765
then is God enough?

603
00:32:27.005 --> 00:32:28.085
I think of the apostle Paul.

604
00:32:28.285 --> 00:32:29.885
I said he, we don't know what it was.

605
00:32:29.885 --> 00:32:31.685
He said he had this thorn in his side

606
00:32:32.305 --> 00:32:34.285
and pleaded with God to take it away.

607
00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:36.605
He said three times. And I think he means by

608
00:32:36.605 --> 00:32:39.325
that three seasons of time, he's begging God.

609
00:32:39.665 --> 00:32:41.085
And what was the Lord's reply?

610
00:32:41.705 --> 00:32:46.405
The Lord said, Paul, my grace is sufficient for you

611
00:32:47.035 --> 00:32:51.645
because my power is perfected in your weakness.

612
00:32:52.315 --> 00:32:54.805
There's something I'm doing you don't understand.

613
00:32:55.585 --> 00:32:58.165
And in the end, Paul was satisfied with that.

614
00:32:58.945 --> 00:33:02.045
And it's something that we need to hold in mind

615
00:33:02.275 --> 00:33:04.205
because the truth is God tests us.

616
00:33:04.585 --> 00:33:08.205
He tries us, he purifies us in some of those hard times.

617
00:33:08.785 --> 00:33:12.005
And the truth is there's always more going on than we see.

618
00:33:12.465 --> 00:33:16.485
And we can believe that as we trust and follow God.

619
00:33:17.465 --> 00:33:19.485
So likewise here, the very end

620
00:33:20.345 --> 00:33:22.685
in Psalm 22, 74, 22,

621
00:33:22.745 --> 00:33:27.205
and 23, he says, arise, oh God, defend your cause.

622
00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:30.445
Remember how the foolish scoffed you all the day.

623
00:33:31.305 --> 00:33:33.845
Do not forget the clamor of your foes.

624
00:33:34.505 --> 00:33:37.125
The uproar of those who rise against you,

625
00:33:37.375 --> 00:33:39.445
which goes up continually.

626
00:33:39.445 --> 00:33:42.005
They mock, they scorn, they revile, they ridicule,

627
00:33:42.665 --> 00:33:45.285
but God brings them to judgment.

628
00:33:45.795 --> 00:33:48.445
This reminds me quickly of Psalm two.

629
00:33:49.255 --> 00:33:52.845
Psalm two goes like this, why do the nation's rage

630
00:33:52.905 --> 00:33:56.125
and the people's plot in vain, the kings

631
00:33:56.125 --> 00:33:57.405
of the earth set themself

632
00:33:57.425 --> 00:34:00.965
and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord

633
00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:03.525
and against his anointed saying,

634
00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:05.965
let us burst their bonds apart

635
00:34:06.385 --> 00:34:08.605
and cast away their accords from us.

636
00:34:09.825 --> 00:34:14.245
But he who sits in the heavens, this is God. He laughs.

637
00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:18.285
The Lord holds them in derision, then he will speak

638
00:34:18.285 --> 00:34:19.325
to them in his wrath

639
00:34:19.665 --> 00:34:23.005
and terrify them in his fury saying, as for me,

640
00:34:23.405 --> 00:34:26.725
I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill.

641
00:34:28.085 --> 00:34:30.485
I will tell of the decree the Lord said to me,

642
00:34:30.825 --> 00:34:32.045
you are my son today.

643
00:34:32.165 --> 00:34:34.485
I have begotten you ask of me

644
00:34:34.545 --> 00:34:37.165
and I will make the nations your heritage

645
00:34:37.505 --> 00:34:39.605
and the ends of the earth your possession.

646
00:34:40.625 --> 00:34:42.405
You shall break them with a rod of iron

647
00:34:42.465 --> 00:34:44.605
and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.

648
00:34:44.985 --> 00:34:48.645
Now therefore, oh kings be wise, be warned.

649
00:34:48.865 --> 00:34:52.685
Oh rulers of the earth serve the Lord with fear

650
00:34:53.305 --> 00:34:55.045
and rejoice with trembling.

651
00:34:55.395 --> 00:34:57.245
Kiss the sun lest he be angry

652
00:34:57.585 --> 00:35:01.205
and you perish in the way for his wrath is quickly kindled.

653
00:35:01.715 --> 00:35:05.445
Blessed are all who take refuge in him,

654
00:35:07.625 --> 00:35:08.725
the nations of the earth.

655
00:35:09.995 --> 00:35:12.445
Even sometimes this thing rises up in us.

656
00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:13.645
We mock against God,

657
00:35:13.705 --> 00:35:16.965
we scorm we ridicule him in our culture.

658
00:35:17.255 --> 00:35:18.485
We're doing it right now.

659
00:35:19.275 --> 00:35:20.645
Just turn on the nightly news

660
00:35:21.785 --> 00:35:24.085
and what the promise and the certainty is.

661
00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:28.245
The warning is that it will be no small thing.

662
00:35:28.345 --> 00:35:32.405
And God will write us down in judgment because he is a holy

663
00:35:32.625 --> 00:35:33.765
and a righteous God.

664
00:35:34.425 --> 00:35:36.165
And we will give an answer and account.

665
00:35:36.585 --> 00:35:41.565
The Bible says every slight word will be given an answer to.

666
00:35:42.905 --> 00:35:45.565
But this is true of any warning in the Bible.

667
00:35:46.825 --> 00:35:47.885
If God didn't care

668
00:35:48.505 --> 00:35:49.565
and didn't wanna be heard,

669
00:35:49.585 --> 00:35:51.125
he wouldn't issue any kind of a warning.

670
00:35:51.845 --> 00:35:55.965
Implicit in a warning is an invitation to change,

671
00:35:56.665 --> 00:36:00.205
an invitation to turn, an invitation to

672
00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:01.925
return to God.

673
00:36:02.585 --> 00:36:05.525
An invitation to the biblical word is repent.

674
00:36:05.995 --> 00:36:07.965
That is reorient from a life.

675
00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:11.965
Live for yourself to pursuing your life. Live for God.

676
00:36:12.195 --> 00:36:13.845
It's turning from your sin.

677
00:36:14.025 --> 00:36:16.885
And to him, who is the only one who can forgive

678
00:36:17.465 --> 00:36:19.565
and save and change you.

679
00:36:20.975 --> 00:36:23.595
The Bible says, today is the day of salvation.

680
00:36:23.975 --> 00:36:25.395
The Bible says that today.

681
00:36:25.535 --> 00:36:27.035
If you hear his voice,

682
00:36:27.775 --> 00:36:30.635
do not harden your heart against him, but respond.

683
00:36:30.635 --> 00:36:33.115
And so I would just say, if there's anyone here in this room

684
00:36:33.135 --> 00:36:34.635
you've never trusted in Jesus,

685
00:36:34.975 --> 00:36:37.555
and you realize, you feel like, Hey, I'm that rebel.

686
00:36:37.855 --> 00:36:41.035
That's the story of my life, then don't leave this morning

687
00:36:41.645 --> 00:36:43.795
until you have trusted in Jesus Christ.

688
00:36:44.305 --> 00:36:45.515
Come talk to any one of us.

689
00:36:45.625 --> 00:36:47.795
We'd love to lead you along that journey

690
00:36:47.795 --> 00:36:49.195
because we've been there too.

691
00:36:49.955 --> 00:36:52.435
'cause every single one of us is a rebel,

692
00:36:52.435 --> 00:36:54.555
an enemy against God in our own nature.

693
00:36:55.545 --> 00:36:57.395
Amen. Every single one of us.

694
00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:59.515
And we all deserve the wrath of God.

695
00:36:59.535 --> 00:37:01.955
Yet he has lavished mercy on us.

696
00:37:02.175 --> 00:37:05.475
He has reigned down mercy on us in Jesus Christ.

697
00:37:05.495 --> 00:37:09.835
He has saved us more than we would've ever even asked for.

698
00:37:10.705 --> 00:37:15.115
Amen. This is a bit of the journey

699
00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:17.235
of Psalm 74.

700
00:37:18.785 --> 00:37:21.595
Even as he weeps over the destruction of Jerusalem,

701
00:37:21.605 --> 00:37:24.555
there was another man who wept over Jerusalem.

702
00:37:24.765 --> 00:37:27.635
About 500 years later, the Lord Jesus, at the end

703
00:37:27.635 --> 00:37:28.755
of his earthly life

704
00:37:28.755 --> 00:37:31.035
and ministry, he was about to go to the cross

705
00:37:31.055 --> 00:37:32.435
and he wept over the city

706
00:37:33.215 --> 00:37:36.355
and he said, yet again, people are going to invade

707
00:37:36.355 --> 00:37:39.075
and destroy because you do not realize the time

708
00:37:39.495 --> 00:37:41.195
of the season, the moment.

709
00:37:41.815 --> 00:37:44.515
And it was that their savior, the Messiah, their king

710
00:37:45.495 --> 00:37:47.155
had actually come.

711
00:37:48.205 --> 00:37:50.915
Psalm 74, the temple had been destroyed

712
00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:53.995
because of Israel's sin and rebellion.

713
00:37:54.015 --> 00:37:55.395
And yet, in the life

714
00:37:55.775 --> 00:37:56.875
and ministry of Jesus,

715
00:37:56.925 --> 00:37:59.315
there was another temple that was destroyed.

716
00:37:59.335 --> 00:38:02.995
He said in John two 19, in 21, destroy this temple.

717
00:38:03.215 --> 00:38:05.515
And in three days, I will raise it up again.

718
00:38:06.135 --> 00:38:08.755
But he was speaking, it says, of the temple

719
00:38:09.185 --> 00:38:12.475
that was his body where they failed.

720
00:38:13.165 --> 00:38:15.595
Jesus Christ succeeded where you

721
00:38:15.615 --> 00:38:20.035
and I fail, Jesus Christ succeeded in his life

722
00:38:20.295 --> 00:38:22.035
and death and resurrection.

723
00:38:22.335 --> 00:38:24.835
And every single one of us must trust him

724
00:38:25.335 --> 00:38:28.115
and embrace him and follow him.

725
00:38:30.065 --> 00:38:34.035
Amen. How are we doing on time?

726
00:38:34.565 --> 00:38:38.165
We're going long. Uh, so here's what I'm gonna do.

727
00:38:39.105 --> 00:38:42.685
I'm gonna skip this part and land the plane.

728
00:38:46.535 --> 00:38:48.435
You know, there's a lot going on when we bring

729
00:38:48.435 --> 00:38:49.595
these kinds of prayers to God.

730
00:38:50.635 --> 00:38:53.395
I think our reminding him, you know, it seems weird

731
00:38:53.395 --> 00:38:56.355
to remind God of something like as though he could forget.

732
00:38:56.495 --> 00:38:58.235
We know he doesn't. Um,

733
00:38:58.735 --> 00:39:00.795
but there's a way in which we entrusted to him.

734
00:39:01.555 --> 00:39:03.515
I if we had time, I'd read Philippians four.

735
00:39:03.735 --> 00:39:05.675
It says, cast all your anxieties on him.

736
00:39:05.985 --> 00:39:07.155
It's 'cause these things are heavy.

737
00:39:07.155 --> 00:39:08.835
They're harder, they're hard for you to carry.

738
00:39:09.105 --> 00:39:11.355
They're hard for me to carry. We need bigger shoulders.

739
00:39:11.355 --> 00:39:12.635
And we put them on gods.

740
00:39:12.935 --> 00:39:15.035
He invites it and he helps us to care.

741
00:39:15.075 --> 00:39:17.675
Likewise, I think as we do that, uh, he,

742
00:39:17.775 --> 00:39:20.475
we also align ourselves with the way God sees the world.

743
00:39:20.535 --> 00:39:23.395
We, we even align ourselves emotionally with God.

744
00:39:24.455 --> 00:39:26.715
And, and we are shaped by that.

745
00:39:26.745 --> 00:39:29.715
Part of prayer is not only asking God things,

746
00:39:30.415 --> 00:39:34.155
but it is also being conformed to his image.

747
00:39:34.935 --> 00:39:39.155
As we think about the truth of who he is and what he's done.

748
00:39:39.155 --> 00:39:41.435
It honors him when we pray like that.

749
00:39:41.615 --> 00:39:44.515
So, uh, this is, so it brings us to our,

750
00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:47.835
it's our final point, which is where we trust in the future.

751
00:39:48.415 --> 00:39:49.795
We trust in future grace.

752
00:39:50.185 --> 00:39:51.835
This is where we live in the moment.

753
00:39:52.215 --> 00:39:54.315
Uh, we ascend the heights of the glory of God.

754
00:39:54.495 --> 00:39:56.315
We descend back into our realities

755
00:39:56.535 --> 00:40:01.035
and then we proceed in trust in the present and the future.

756
00:40:01.645 --> 00:40:04.835
Grace of God that he provides for us in this way, our pro,

757
00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:07.795
our problems, our issues, our struggles,

758
00:40:08.065 --> 00:40:10.715
they become like a proxy for experiencing God.

759
00:40:11.085 --> 00:40:13.355
There are opportunities for us to encounter him.

760
00:40:13.375 --> 00:40:18.275
Romans 8 28 says, God somehow, amazingly uses all things

761
00:40:19.055 --> 00:40:21.035
for our good and for his glory.

762
00:40:21.495 --> 00:40:23.635
And we see that over and over again.

763
00:40:23.655 --> 00:40:25.875
You might say that the fix is in.

764
00:40:26.705 --> 00:40:28.755
It's like God has his thumb on the scales.

765
00:40:28.945 --> 00:40:30.795
Humanly speaking, we're like, that's cheating.

766
00:40:30.855 --> 00:40:33.795
That's a problem. But here's the truth about your future.

767
00:40:34.935 --> 00:40:36.675
God has his thumb on the scales.

768
00:40:36.695 --> 00:40:41.475
He has already solved every single one of your problems.

769
00:40:42.185 --> 00:40:44.235
It's just a matter of us getting to

770
00:40:44.235 --> 00:40:45.715
that point in history and time.

771
00:40:46.335 --> 00:40:49.155
And that's what we'd call future grace.

772
00:40:49.705 --> 00:40:51.915
That his grace will sustain us now

773
00:40:52.335 --> 00:40:54.635
and it will sustain us when we get there.

774
00:40:55.175 --> 00:40:58.315
And it will sustain us, sustain us beyond his way.

775
00:40:58.315 --> 00:40:59.435
In a moment we're gonna sing a song.

776
00:40:59.955 --> 00:41:03.675
Sing in the line is I know how the story ends

777
00:41:04.335 --> 00:41:06.555
and that's the thing we fix our gaze on.

778
00:41:08.255 --> 00:41:11.435
So when we're faced with protracted trials

779
00:41:11.975 --> 00:41:16.355
and questions that haunt us, if we're, if we're sort

780
00:41:16.355 --> 00:41:19.275
of in the midst of a story that God is writing but writing,

781
00:41:19.535 --> 00:41:23.315
but we're not yet to the victory side of that, we persevere

782
00:41:23.935 --> 00:41:26.355
in the face of taunts and mockery in our culture.

783
00:41:26.655 --> 00:41:29.395
We trust God who sees and hears them and knows them

784
00:41:29.695 --> 00:41:32.195
and even redeems people like that

785
00:41:32.195 --> 00:41:34.755
because we know he redeemed people like us.

786
00:41:36.455 --> 00:41:40.955
We grieve, we believe we plead, we trust in future grace.
