WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.500
Amen. Well, good morning, church. Uh, my name is Trr Lewis.

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.380
It's a pleasure to get to be with you this morning. Um,

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.580
I get to serve as one of the elders here at Henderson Hills and when we get to

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.460
teach, it's a special pleasure. Um, bring your greetings from the elder council.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.260
We meet every other Tuesday night and pray for our church family,

6
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.740
both specifically and just in general for needs. And that's a huge, um,

7
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.060
privilege of our to get to do in honor, um,

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.420
and welcome on Memorial Day. Uh, we do wanna remember today,

9
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.660
we wanna remember those who have served our country in the military. Um,

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.740
we wanna remember you all who may have family members that are serving right

11
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.460
now, um, and those who have lost loved ones, family and friends,

12
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.820
uh, to military service. So I wanna take a moment this morning to pray,

13
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.780
pray for us to that end. And then as we open God's word, father,

14
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.700
this morning we, um, open your word to read about your spirit.

15
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.260
Your spirit poured out to your sons and daughters.

16
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.980
And we know that your spirit moves in so many mighty ways. Father,

17
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.100
one of those is through comforter, through healer. And so, father,

18
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.900
we pray that this morning for those who are remembering those whom they've lost,

19
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.780
we thank you for the sacrifice, the example, um, that they set in that of,

20
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.820
of sacrificing themselves, um, for others,

21
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.740
just as you did for us Father. And this morning, as we open your word,

22
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.020
I pray that your spirit would speak, Lord, not through the notes on the page,

23
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.460
but Father, um, into the hearts of those who hear.

24
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.380
It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Okay, well,

25
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.860
um, it is a pleasure to get to be here. Um, I,

26
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.220
I signed up for the Sunday after Heath Thomas,

27
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.580
cuz I thought he might have left some of his hair products backstage,

28
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.740
and he didn't, unfortunately. So, um,

29
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.860
so here we are this morning,

30
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.860
but this is Pentecost Sunday and Pentecost Sunday is a Sunday in the

31
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.340
church calendar where we recognize and we

32
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.160
observe.

33
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.020
We remember the coming of the Holy Spirit on the disciples

34
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.060
in Jerusalem. And it's a time for us to,

35
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.180
to reflect and to see how the Holy Spirit's been at work. Now,

36
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.980
my wife and I have been at members of Henderson Hills here for about 19 years.

37
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.300
And several years ago we were, um,

38
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.420
a part of serving a meal at the college house, um, with our community group,

39
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.420
or it may have been a flock at the time, I can't remember in that transition.

40
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.180
But I was there and we would hang around and visit with the college students

41
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.620
after the meal. And they would, uh, ask questions.

42
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.420
We would talk about their major and career aspirations.

43
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.700
And this one Sunday night, this one, uh, student from the Middle East,

44
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.580
we were sitting on the porch, I still remember it clear as day. And he said,

45
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.980
you know, I know about this God, I've heard people talk about him. Um, I,

46
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.760
people have told me about Jesus, but what is the Holy Spirit?

47
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.470
What is the Holy Spirit?

48
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.110
And so I'm certain that I fumbled through some answer. And we, we talked for,

49
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.950
for some time, um, and I,

50
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.950
I pray that the word used some of those words to water seeds in his life.

51
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.350
And he seemed fairly content with the answer. And so we parted ways.

52
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.390
But I've thought about that question in the year since that it's probably been a

53
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.990
decade both about that question, but also the motivation of the question.

54
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.670
And the first thing I wanna do this morning is to rephrase that question,

55
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.630
not what is the Holy Spirit, but who is the Holy Spirit?

56
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.430
That's our question this morning. Who is the Holy Spirit?

57
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.070
And as we open the text, we're gonna see him move.

58
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.670
And then we're gonna look throughout Scripture at his actions and attributes.

59
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.630
We see today that the Holy Spirit is God, the Trinity,

60
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.510
the Holy Spirit is part of the Trinity. He's God with us.

61
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.270
Now, the earliest,

62
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.270
earliest writings about the Trinity were from this guy named Tetuan,

63
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.030
which is a cool name to say. And also he was from Tunisia,

64
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.310
which is in Northern Africa, which is a whole nother, a whole nother deal.

65
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.110
But he, he, he put together the different, um,

66
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.670
parts of scripture that talk about God the Father, God the Son,

67
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.030
and God the Spirit, and develop this doctrine of the Trinity

68
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.790
thousands of years ago in about one 50 ad.

69
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.790
And so we see the Trinity at work throughout scripture,

70
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.790
and today we're gonna focus on that person of the Holy Spirit.

71
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.110
One particular verse, we'll come back to you later, but we see in Titus three,

72
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.750
uh, verses four through six, he says,

73
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.630
but when the goodness and loving kindness of our God, our Savior appeared,

74
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.870
he saved us not because of works and righteousness,

75
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.670
but according to his own mercy by the washing

76
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.950
and regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,

77
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.710
whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior.

78
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.520
So we see the Father of the Son and the Holy Spirit all working together,

79
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.280
God three in one. And as followers of Christ,

80
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.160
we should know who is the Holy Spirit.

81
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.600
We should be intimately acquainted with him because there are,

82
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.440
there are myriad of misrepresentations and countless confusions about who he is

83
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.660
and how we are to relate to him. Now, for the last five weeks,

84
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.220
we've walked through the book of Joel,

85
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.820
the prophecy of the Day of the Lord coming.

86
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.220
And we read in Joel 2 28 through 30, it says,

87
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.100
and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit on

88
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.660
all flesh. Your sons and your daughter shall prophesy.

89
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.300
Your old men shall dream dreams.

90
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.140
Your young men shall see visions even on the male and female servants.

91
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.660
In those days, I will pour out my spirit

92
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.230
that there has come, we are in that time.

93
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.480
We live in the age of that fulfillment when the Holy Spirit has been poured out

94
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.680
to us. And so let's turn today, acts chapter two.

95
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.120
We're gonna read of that time in scripture where the Holy Spirit came on and was

96
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.600
poured out on the disciples at Pentecost.

97
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.400
Now obviously we cannot answer fully

98
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.800
who is the Holy Spirit today, but we're gonna look at three key things.

99
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.640
We're gonna look at his appearance when he appeared, when he came on the scene.

100
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.000
We're gonna look at his attributes, both in the Old and New Testament,

101
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.920
and also at his actions. So let's turn in Acts two.

102
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.320
So we see this Pentecost, it's the Feast of Weeks.

103
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.160
It's a time where people have gathered in Jerusalem.

104
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.850
It's a time where they came to celebrate the harvest,

105
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.690
celebrate the first fruits with a sacrifice.

106
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.610
And so Jews were gathered from all over the known world at that time to

107
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.170
Jerusalem. It was a huge celebration.

108
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.050
And we read Luke's words in Acts chapter two. He says,

109
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.010
when the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all gathered together in one place.

110
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.330
And suddenly there came from heaven, a sound like a mighty rushing wind.

111
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.890
And it filled the entire house where they were sitting and divided tongues of

112
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.490
fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.

113
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.930
And they were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as

114
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.840
the Spirit gave them utterance. Now, there were dwelling in Jerusalem,

115
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.760
Jews devout men from every nation under heaven. And at this sound,

116
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.000
a multitude came together and they were bewildered because each one was hearing

117
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.160
them speak in his own language. And they were amazed and astonished saying,

118
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.560
are not all these speaking Galilean?

119
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.740
And how is it that we hear each of us in our own native language,

120
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.140
Parthians and meads, elamites and resonance of Mesopotamia,

121
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.220
Judea, OCIA Ponta in Asia, Faria Phi, Egypt,

122
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.060
and the parts of Egypt belonging to cyrene visitors from Rome,

123
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.220
both Jews and Proselytes Creon Arabian.

124
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.300
We hear them telling in our own tongues, the mighty works of God

125
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.780
and all we're amazed saying to one another, what does this mean?

126
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.100
But others mock them saying they're filled with new wine.

127
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:25.040
So this scene happens when God has created an atmosphere for his spirit to move.

128
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.080
He's brought people in to hear this message. He's prepared the place.

129
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.400
And Jesus had commanded his disciples to stay.

130
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.160
You could imagine that in this time,

131
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.760
this probably wasn't the most comfortable place for the disciples to be.

132
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.840
There were Jews coming from all over the world. But just a chapter before,

133
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.360
just before his ascension,

134
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.240
Christ says he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait,

135
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.800
to wait for the promise from the Father, in which he said,

136
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.520
you heard from me for John baptized with water,

137
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.810
but you'll be baptized with the Holy Spirit.

138
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.810
Not many days from now.

139
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.130
Now this had been 10 days from the time that he spoke these words.

140
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.010
So the time from, uh, Passover to Pentecost was 50 days.

141
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.090
We read in Acts one that the Lord in his, um,

142
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.450
in his resurrection body before the ascension was with the disciples for 40

143
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.250
days, right? So even we can do the math,

144
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.410
that's 10 days that the disciples were waiting and they were probably ready,

145
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.490
right? They were probably ready for this gift, for this Holy Spirit to come.

146
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.450
You can imagine that they had enthusiasm, but it might have started to wane.

147
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.730
They may have even started to question when or if this Holy Spirit might come.

148
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.540
And so they were gathered, they were praying,

149
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.860
and then suddenly Luke riots, like a mighty rushing wind from heaven,

150
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.100
the Spirit came in and filled the house,

151
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.500
but he didn't just fill the house above them.

152
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.860
It says he divided into individual tongues of fire and appeared to them and

153
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:07.380
rested individually on each one of them and filled the, filled them,

154
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.580
filled the disciples. So when the spirit comes,

155
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.460
he comes in power and he comes individually to Phyllis.

156
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.500
We see them in the Spirit, begin to speak in different languages.

157
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.900
They're able to communicate these mighty works of God in a new way.

158
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.420
You see, when the spirit's poured out, he creates connection and community.

159
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:34.220
He's a, he's given new abilities to these disciples of Christ to speak.

160
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.640
And we see that he's empowering the message.

161
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.080
And we see later that he will embolden them then to go.

162
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.200
And you see the disciples were ready for this.

163
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.840
They were anticipating this work of the Spirit.

164
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.240
John Jesus had been teaching back in John.

165
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.040
We read John 14 and in 16 about the promise of the Holy Spirit.

166
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.400
And then just before he left, he told them to wait.

167
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.360
And so they had been anticipating this gift, this gift of the helper.

168
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.480
So they were looking what God would do. But you see,

169
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.280
the rest of the world wasn't ready

170
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.510
just as the world wasn't ready for Jesus. And many missed the Messiah.

171
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.480
The people gathered, the Jews gathered there, weren't ready for the Holy Spirit.

172
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.730
But we want to be ready. We want to know the spirit.

173
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.930
We want to be able to recognize him at work.

174
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.810
We wanna know properly what is the spirit at work and what is not the spirit at

175
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.210
work. So we're gonna spend some time this morning looking at his actions and his

176
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.010
attributes. You see, there's a,

177
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.170
there's a level of subjectivity and objectivity. Okay?

178
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.810
There's subjectivity where we feel the spirit, we see a move,

179
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.450
but then there's objectivity of seeing the spirit in the word.

180
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.370
And we're gonna do both this morning.

181
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.640
But I wanna start with looking at the word because that lays our foundation for

182
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.493
who God is.

183
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.120
And then that allows us to look at the actions and see is that the spirit at

184
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.480
work around us.

185
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.790
The other reality is that when we study something, we see it around us, right?

186
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.070
If there's something that we study, that we know if we're,

187
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:16.310
if we're shopping for something new, if you're looking for a new, um,

188
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.870
Honda Accord, right?

189
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:22.310
Then you notice all the Honda Accords on the road around you. And if you're,

190
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:26.230
if you're, if you've noticed or been exposed to a new flavor or a new spice,

191
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.310
then, then you start to taste that in foods.

192
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.950
Maybe you hadn't tasted it in before.

193
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.150
And so we want to gather an appreciation this morning. So if it,

194
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.630
if it feels academic for a minute, as we walk through some scripture, uh,

195
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.870
rest in that and uh, and and,

196
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.230
and take notes of scripture to go back and look at, and this is just a taste,

197
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.150
so that as you start to look through scripture,

198
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.710
we're gonna see the spirit more and more at work.

199
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.990
So let's look at his attributes.

200
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.710
So we talked earlier that the Spirit is God, the Holy Spirit is God.

201
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.990
And so any attribute of God that we would say applies to the Spirit,

202
00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.670
father, son and spirit all have the same attributes.

203
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:07.790
They display their divinity in different ways and at different times,

204
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.670
but they all have those attributes.

205
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.830
So let's look at omniscience as an attribute.

206
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.030
We know that we would say God is omniscient. He is all knowing.

207
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.590
And Paul writes in one Corinthians chapter two, verse nine, he says,

208
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.910
but as it is written, what no I has seen nor ear has heard,

209
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.630
nor the heart of man imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.

210
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.670
These things God has revealed to us through the Spirit,

211
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.510
for the spirit searches everything,

212
00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.630
even the depths of God for who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of

213
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.890
that person which is in him. So also,

214
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:48.690
no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the spirit of God.

215
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.530
You see friends, the spirit is all know him. He's also omnipresent.

216
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.490
He's everywhere. In Psalm 1 39,

217
00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.130
the famous song from David, he sings,

218
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.570
where shall I go from your Spirit? Or Where shall I flee from your presence?

219
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.010
If I ascend to the heaven, you are there. If I make my bed and shield,

220
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:09.303
you are there.

221
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.930
If I take on the wings of the morning and dwell on the uttermost of the sea,

222
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.810
even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me.

223
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.570
Holy Spirit is everywhere. We can't escape his presence.

224
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.330
He's also omnipotent the spirit's all powerful.

225
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.910
Paul writes to us in Romans 15, he says,

226
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.390
I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished

227
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.830
through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience by word and by deed,

228
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.470
by the power of signs and wonders,

229
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.030
by the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

230
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.950
So that from Jerusalem and all the way around to a rium,

231
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.960
I will have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ.

232
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.880
And you see together,

233
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.280
Paul is linking the ministry and the power of Christ with the ministry and the

234
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.360
power of the Spirit because they're inseparable.

235
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.520
Both are all powerful.

236
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.760
Next we would say that God is holy. Well, that's easy.

237
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.240
It's right there in the name Holy Spirit, right?

238
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.240
We see that the Lord is sovereign. Our God is sovereign. He is in control.

239
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.590
We see the spirit's sovereignty played out in one Corinthians 12, verse 11,

240
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:29.270
where he says, he gives gifts to believers as he apportions,

241
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.110
as he wills in the Old Testament. In first Samuel,

242
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:38.070
we see his sovereignty played out as the Holy Spirit rushes on

243
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.470
Saul in his anointing as the first king of Israel,

244
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:47.390
the Holy Spirit is eternal. The writer of Hebrews identifies him in verse nine,

245
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.990
in chapter nine, verse 14, as the eternal Spirit,

246
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.670
holy Spirit is loving. And second Samuel, chapter seven,

247
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.910
he's speaking of David. And he says, I will be to him a father,

248
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.030
and he shall be to my son, to be to me a son. When he commits iniquity,

249
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:10.150
I will discipline him with a rot of men, with the stripes of the sons of men.

250
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.260
But my steadfast love will not depart from him.

251
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.950
And then Paul in Romans five,

252
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.740
tells us about our hope. And he says,

253
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.020
this hope does not put us to shame because God's love has been poured into our

254
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.940
hearts through the Holy Spirit.

255
00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.980
That the Holy Spirit is love in the same way. God is love.

256
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.690
And he pours that into our hearts. Holy Spirit is gracious.

257
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.410
We see that in one Corinthians 12 where it says,

258
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.010
no one can say that Jesus' Lord, except in the Spirit,

259
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.050
it's by his grace.

260
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.170
It's through his graciousness even that we can say that he is Lord.

261
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.090
He speaks to our spirit, he calls our spirit and he gives us life.

262
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.980
The Holy Spirit is steadfast. He's always with us. He never leaves.

263
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.340
In Ephesians one, Paul writes in him, you also,

264
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.460
when you heard the word of truth,

265
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.460
the gospel of your salvation and believed in him,

266
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:17.690
you were sealed with a promised Holy Spirit who is the guarantee of our

267
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.250
inheritance until we acquire possession of it to the praise of His glory.

268
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.790
So we see through all these attributes,

269
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.670
these are attributes that we would describe to God the Father, God the Son,

270
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:34.110
and also God, the Spirit. So if there's anything that we take away from today,

271
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.710
we should know that the Spirit is God. He's not heir,

272
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.230
he's not a figment, he's not a ghost.

273
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.510
He is personal and he is personable. He is knowable.

274
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.880
Now, this side of heaven, we can't know him perfectly,

275
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.680
but he does know us perfectly and he breathes into us.

276
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.290
So let's look at the actions of the spirit. What's he doing?

277
00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.610
What is the spirit doing?

278
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.330
We don't have to go very far into scripture until we see the spirit. In fact,

279
00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.770
in Genesis, in Genesis chapter one,

280
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.450
we see the spirit in creation says in the beginning,

281
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.050
God created the heavens in the earth.

282
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.010
The earth was without form and void and darkness was over the face of the deep.

283
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:23.210
And the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the

284
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.810
waters. You see, it's the spirit of God that was there and moving.

285
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.810
He's hovering over the creation that he's about to create

286
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:38.130
in later. In that, in in, in that same chapter, in verse 27 26,

287
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:43.250
we see this famous creation verse Genesis 1 26, where he says,

288
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.970
let us make man in our image, in our likeness.

289
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.850
And many times we, we put God the Father and God the Son,

290
00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.690
together in that narrative. And that is very true. And God,

291
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.650
the Spirit is there just as much. We read later in, in Genesis two,

292
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.050
that he breathed life into Adam.

293
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.890
He was the breath of life.

294
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.570
David sings this out in his psalms and Psalm 33 where he says the word

295
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:16.530
made the heavens and the breath, the Spirit made the host. And then Psalm 1 0 4,

296
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.850
he says, when the breath is taken away, there's death.

297
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.050
But when the spirit is sent, it creates life.

298
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.660
And so we see this breath of God, this breathing out this action of the spirit.

299
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.780
And that's why the study of the Holy Spirit is called nematology. Now,

300
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.060
we didn't put that on the notes because nobody would've come,

301
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.820
but nematology is the study of the spirit. It's the study of the breath of God.

302
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:47.020
Christology, the study of Christ, pathology, the study of the Father,

303
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.980
and nematology the study of the Spirit.

304
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.020
So in a moment, at the end of the service,

305
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.820
when we're singing about the breath of our lungs singing out, praise to God,

306
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.720
that's the Holy Spirit in us. That's the breath of God.

307
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.280
That's the new life in us.

308
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.850
We read later in Ezekiel, uh, chapter 37, about him not only giving,

309
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.530
but also sustaining and creating new life.

310
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:20.610
So if you'll turn into Ezekiel 37, we're gonna read that

311
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.510
now. If you get an Old Testament scholar, PhD, you get Old Testament.

312
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.670
If you get a bone doctor, you get bones, right?

313
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.230
So we're gonna read Ezekiel 37. It says,

314
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:39.030
the hand of the Lord was upon me and he brought me out in the

315
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:43.150
spirit of the Lord and sent me down in the middle of the valley

316
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:49.480
and it was full of bones. And he led me around among them.

317
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.280
And behold,

318
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.670
there were very many on the surface of the valley and they were very dry.

319
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:03.370
And he said to me, son of man, can these bones live? And I answered,

320
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.450
oh Lord, you know? Then he said to me,

321
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.850
prophesy over these bones and say to them, oh, dry bones,

322
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.290
hear the word of the Lord, thus says the Lord God to these bones,

323
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.450
behold that will cause breath to enter into you and you will live.

324
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.050
And I will a sinews upon you and cause flesh to come upon you and cover you with

325
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.650
skin and put breath in you and you shall live.

326
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:32.970
And you shall know that I am the Lord. Ezekiel continues to write, he says.

327
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.570
So I prophesied and I commanded. And as I prophesied,

328
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:40.130
there was a sound and behold a rattling. And the bones came together,

329
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.610
bone to bone. And I looked behold,

330
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.250
and there were sinews on them and flesh came upon them and skin had covered

331
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:50.210
them, but there was no breath in them. And then he said to me,

332
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:55.210
prophesy to the breath, prophesy son a man and say to the breath,

333
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.730
thus says the Lord God

334
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.980
come from the four wins of breath and breathe on these slain that they may live.

335
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.060
So I prophesied as the Lord commanded me,

336
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.500
and the breath came into them and they lived and stood on their feet and

337
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.340
exceedingly great army. And then he said to me, son of man,

338
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.620
these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say,

339
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.380
our bones are dried up. Our hope is lost. Indeed, we are cut off,

340
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.980
therefore prophesy and say to them, thus says the Lord, behold,

341
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.780
I will open your graves and I will raise your graves on my people,

342
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.660
and I will bring you into the land of Israel.

343
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.100
You shall know that I'm the Lord when I open your graves and raise your graves

344
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.300
on my people. I will put my spirit in you and you shall live,

345
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.380
and I will place you in your own land.

346
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:48.060
And then you shall know that I am the Lord. I have spoken. I will do it,

347
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.940
declares the Lord.

348
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:55.430
Now that's a long passage about the Spirit speaking to

349
00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.390
Ezekiel and then moving through as a breath of life into these dry bones.

350
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:05.230
And, and the Spirit then takes me into Ephesians two,

351
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.910
where Paul writes that we were dead in our transgressions,

352
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:13.670
but praise God that we've been given new and sustaining life through the Spirit.

353
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.970
We also read that the Holy Spirit inspires holiness in that new life.

354
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.170
We're called to live holy lives, p uh,

355
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.810
David and and Psalm 1 43 Rights, teach me to do your will. Oh God,

356
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.250
let your good spirit lead me on level ground.

357
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.540
We see the old, the the Old Testament example of the spirit giving strength,

358
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.140
giving power for special things at special times. And judges,

359
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.980
we studied that several years ago about Samson and Gideon and Deborah,

360
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.160
all receiving the spirit to do the mighty works of God.

361
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:56.000
We see the spirit of God anointing and leading through Saul and through David.

362
00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:02.240
We see him coming and going in these men's lives for

363
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.120
his will and for God's glory.

364
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.063
In Isaiah,

365
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.370
we read that the Spirit will rest on the Messiah in chapter 11,

366
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.450
that wisdom and understanding power and might knowledge and the fear of the

367
00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:20.290
Lord, the Spirit at work. And we see that revealed,

368
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:24.570
we see that fulfilled in Christ's baptism as is anointing,

369
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.290
as the Spirit came down like a dove.

370
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.510
The Holy Spirit points to Christ in all things.

371
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.000
And we see him breathing out scripture throughout the prophets.

372
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:42.240
Earlier in Ezekiel two, um, God said to Ezekiel, in, in chapter two,

373
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.920
verse one through three says, son of man,

374
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.600
stand on your feet and I will speak with you. And as he spoke to me,

375
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.880
Ezekiel rights, the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet.

376
00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.000
And I heard him speaking to me. And he said to me, son of man,

377
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.600
I send you to the people of Israel,

378
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.040
to the nation of rebels who have rebelled against me.

379
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.600
We read later in second Peter that no prophecy

380
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.150
was ever produced by the will of man,

381
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:16.510
but men spoke from God as they were carried on by the Holy Spirit. You see,

382
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.470
Peter was talking about his own observations,

383
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.310
his own ways that he saw Christ.

384
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.770
But he says that we have seen the prophetic word more confirmed, more fulfilled,

385
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.330
even through scripture, through the Spirit at work.

386
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.850
And so this is the heritage of the spirit. This is, this is what the,

387
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.850
the disciples would've been able to see in their writings.

388
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.610
They would've seen the spirit of truth, the spirit of God,

389
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:48.970
the breath of God, the Holy Spirit at work all throughout the Old Testament.

390
00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.650
And so they anticipated his coming.

391
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.890
They anticipated that promise of John chapter 14.

392
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.010
And in John chapter 16, where,

393
00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:05.090
where God pro Jesus promises that he's gonna send another helper and

394
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:09.330
that a helper we're also bring to remembrance all that Jesus has taught.

395
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.950
And so as we go throughout the New Testament, we see the Holy Spirit convicting.

396
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.350
We see him helping and healing. We see Him counseling.

397
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.480
Paul writes that He prays for us when we can't pray for ourselves,

398
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.840
that he bears fruit in our lives.

399
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.480
He gives boldness to the followers of Christ and he guides us.

400
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.800
But let's jump back into Acts chapter two and see this work of the Spirit played

401
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.110
out in verse four

402
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:46.430
We're reminded. It says He filled all with the Holy Spirit.

403
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.670
All were filled with the Holy Spirit. Now that filled is saturated, right?

404
00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.400
That's the, that's the fulfillment. When Christ said you would be baptized,

405
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.360
immersed, filled with, saturated with the Holy Spirit.

406
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.200
And then he goes about his work.

407
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.680
We know this story where the disciples were able to speak in all these different

408
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.480
languages and people that came from all these other countries could understand

409
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.040
as if in their own language. And they weren't just speaking about anything.

410
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.360
They weren't just speaking randomly.

411
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.440
They were speaking about the mighty works of God.

412
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:23.520
This was an undoubtedly a work of the Spirit. And then in this time,

413
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:27.360
Peter preaches his first sermon. He's empowered by the Holy Spirit.

414
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.840
And there's order that comes.

415
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.560
And Peter lifts his voice and he proclaims Christ.

416
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.770
He walks through this revelation.

417
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.410
He explains for these Jews that this is the revelation of Joel.

418
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.370
This is the pouring out of the spirit. It's not new wine.

419
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:46.750
And then he,

420
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:51.170
he reminds him of the words of David of the Messiah in Psalm 16,

421
00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:55.650
and then proclaims that Jesus is that Messiah where he says,

422
00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.250
I saw the Lord always before me.

423
00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.700
He is at my right hand that I not may not be shaken. Therefore,

424
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.460
my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced and my flesh will dwell in hope.

425
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.860
So he recites these words that would've resonated.

426
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.900
And through the spirit he has used to connect the Father to the Son,

427
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.700
he reveals to them that the Messiah that they were waiting is Christ who they

428
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.340
crucified. And he's very clear in that he doesn't pull any punches at all.

429
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.470
And then we get to verse 36, and Peter brings it home.

430
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.050
He says,

431
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:35.550
let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him

432
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:40.550
both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.

433
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.820
Now we see a flip. We've seen the spirit working through Peter,

434
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.100
working through the disciples,

435
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.540
and now we see the Spirit at work and the hearers.

436
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.420
He says Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart.

437
00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.700
They were cut to their core.

438
00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.020
And they said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles Brothers, what shall we do?

439
00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:06.790
And Peter said to them, repent and be baptized.

440
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.830
You see, the Holy Spirit was at work and those hearers,

441
00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.070
he was calling and convicting.

442
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.810
And Peter simply completes the truth of the gospel. He says,

443
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:22.410
repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the

444
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:27.170
forgiveness of your sins. And you'll receive the same gift of the Holy Spirit.

445
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.090
This promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off.

446
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:36.930
Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord our God.

447
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.040
And so this is the work of the spirit in the world.

448
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.330
He works through enabling and calling followers of Christ,

449
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.330
but he also works in those to whom he is speaking.

450
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:55.730
And so it is important. It's important that we know who the Holy Spirit is.

451
00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:01.090
He is God. He's omnipotent, he's omniscient, he's wholly imperfect.

452
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.490
He's He's all those things.

453
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.510
And we see these actions of what He does. We see him call and convict.

454
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:14.550
We see him in dwell and illuminate. He helps and he heals.

455
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:20.630
We see in Titus that he regenerates and he renews. He points to Jesus,

456
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:25.110
the Prince of Peace. The Holy Spirit directs our desires.

457
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:30.750
He secures and he sanctifies us. He empowers us for proclamation

458
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:37.620
and all that's good. The work of the Spirit is good. And in Romans eight,

459
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:42.300
Paul tells us that the Spirit bears witness with our spirit.

460
00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.220
He reminds us as followers that we did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall

461
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:47.860
back into fear.

462
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.740
But we've received the spirit capital s of adoption as

463
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.980
sons by whom we cry. Abba Father, the Spirit himself,

464
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.780
bears witness with our spirit.

465
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:04.110
And so we all have a personal testimony of how the Spirit has worked in our

466
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:08.070
lives. That as we look for the spirit at work in our lives,

467
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.630
we're gonna see him at work in our lives if we are indeed followers of Christ.

468
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:18.310
I can look back and see his call and conviction on my heart sitting on a cabin

469
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.630
floor at Sky Ranch Camp so many years ago.

470
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.060
And I,

471
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.340
I can remember the Holy Spirit speaking to me while I was pumping gas at a

472
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.860
7-Eleven on 15th and Western,

473
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:34.440
opening my heart to the truths of why he had moved our family to Oklahoma,

474
00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.920
why he had guided and directed, and I didn't know why,

475
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.160
but then he revealed that

476
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.720
I remember the work of the Spirit in our family and mine and

477
00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.680
Julie's hearts walking through a miscarriage that he helped. And he healed us.

478
00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.960
He comforted us in that season.

479
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.440
I remember the work of the spirit sitting right back over here,

480
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.920
right where the hos are sitting,

481
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.720
speaking to my heart during a service and directing where I would go to serve in

482
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.800
Nicaragua and not move to another place.

483
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.060
And then I remember the work of the spirit,

484
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:19.910
him speaking to my heart and speaking through me to teach pastors in

485
00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:24.710
Nicaragua. And if you had told me years before that I would ever be doing that,

486
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:29.790
I would've said, no way, Jose. But the Spirit works.

487
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:30.950
And he moves and he does.

488
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:35.510
Mighty works for proclamation and he promises to do the same.

489
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.160
But too often we miss it.

490
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.680
We miss the work of the Holy Spirit because we're not tuned in to what he's

491
00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.480
doing. Some people, some churches, um,

492
00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.600
think only about God the Father in this, in this otherness,

493
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.080
this reverence in all. And he's unapproachable and we get focused and,

494
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.120
and we can get dried out with that. And others might only focus on,

495
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:05.920
on Christ the Son. And he's our bro and our bff and first among brothers.

496
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.040
And we lose that reverent awe.

497
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.140
And others still might only focus on the spirit of what he might do for me,

498
00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:16.820
what he might give me, how he might prophesy through me, heal me,

499
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.340
pour out on me. And Satan wants that division.

500
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.020
He wants us to,

501
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.780
to piecemeal out and lose sight of the perfect unity that is in God.

502
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:33.200
This triunity, the Trinity. You see the truth.

503
00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.120
The reality is that God, the Father,

504
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:40.920
sent God the Son so that we might know him and be joined

505
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.600
back to him. And then God, the Son, sent the Spirit,

506
00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.720
the Holy Spirit to be a permanent resident in our lives,

507
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.560
not coming and going,

508
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:55.560
but staying and filling to help and to counsel and to direct and

509
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.393
give life,

510
00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.980
to point to Christ and to illuminate his word,

511
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.610
which is how we might know the Father. You see,

512
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:09.520
the Spirit calls people. And he's calling today,

513
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.330
he's calling me and he's calling you.

514
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:20.090
He called the followers in Jerusalem to repent and be

515
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:25.010
baptized. And that may be the call for some today to repent,

516
00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:27.770
to turn from sin, to turn to Christ,

517
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.850
to allow that spirit of renewal and regeneration to work.

518
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:38.450
He may be calling you as followers of Christ to turn from sin

519
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:42.810
and trust in him, to turn from the world and the security of the world,

520
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.250
and trust in him as ultimate security.

521
00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:51.550
And he may be calling us to simply kneel and to know,

522
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:55.670
to know God, to spend time at his feet,

523
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.670
to be filled with the spirit and then to proclaim his truth to those around us.

524
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.450
So this morning, as we go to the Lord in prayer,

525
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.770
as we sit at the feet of the cross of Christ,

526
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.330
as we open our hearts through the spirit,

527
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.610
let us pray and listen to how the Spirit might be calling.
