1
00:00:01.275 --> 00:00:03.605
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:06.805
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.565
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:13.925
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:17.085
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:28.125
Well, good morning, if you would please open your Bibles

7
00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:29.285
to Psalm 73.

8
00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.575
Psalm 73. I'm glad you're here this morning.

9
00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:35.895
Uh, my name is Aaron Ferguson

10
00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:39.055
and I'm one of the elders here at Henderson Hills

11
00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:41.015
and it's my privilege to

12
00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.815
study Psalm 73 with you this morning.

13
00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:47.615
While you're turning there, I wanna wish you a happy moon

14
00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:48.775
landing day.

15
00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:51.735
It's actually yesterday,

16
00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:56.295
but as a teacher of American history, I keep track

17
00:00:56.295 --> 00:00:57.295
of these sorts of things.

18
00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:00.815
On July 20th, 1969,

19
00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:05.445
the Apollo 11 mission landed

20
00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:08.045
Neil Armstrong

21
00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:12.045
and Buzz Aldrin on the moon in the Eagle, one

22
00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:15.445
of the most watched events in world history,

23
00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:17.805
some 600 million viewers.

24
00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:20.805
And of course we got those famous words,

25
00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:23.605
the eagle has landed.

26
00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:27.645
Yeah. And then Neil first man

27
00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:30.765
to step foot on the moon uttered that profound statement.

28
00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:36.005
That's one small step for man, one giant

29
00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:37.805
leap for mankind.

30
00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:40.125
Yeah, I guess you could say he understood the

31
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.565
gravity of the situation.

32
00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:47.285
Um, anyway, that goes down in history as one

33
00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:51.685
of the greatest statements that uh, anyone has ever made.

34
00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:53.605
What did they do on the moon?

35
00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:56.725
They spent quite a bit of time gathering rocks.

36
00:01:56.725 --> 00:01:59.405
They drove the buggy down to uh, moon River

37
00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.085
and they uh,

38
00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:06.885
They went to Starbucks, got a latte.

39
00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:08.045
Anyway, they did some other things.

40
00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:10.485
You'll be interested to know

41
00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:14.965
that since 1969 they've been back to the moon six times.

42
00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:18.725
They've also set up a, uh, space station,

43
00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:20.725
the Hubble Telescope and other things.

44
00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:22.365
And of course they built a new restaurant.

45
00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:25.965
If you haven't heard, uh, critics say the food is great,

46
00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:27.125
but there's no atmosphere.

47
00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.805
So, so sorry.

48
00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:37.365
Don't fact check me on any of that. Okay.

49
00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.565
My students at school, they, they've learned to, uh,

50
00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:44.965
believe about half of what I say.

51
00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:49.005
And so anyway, I know that gives you great confidence

52
00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:52.045
as we go into uh, Psalm 73.

53
00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:57.205
But anyway, we are in a 15 year

54
00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:59.765
series on the book of Psalms

55
00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:02.525
and we've made it almost halfway.

56
00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:06.925
Psalm 73, the uh, Psalms are just

57
00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:11.125
songs, poems set to music.

58
00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:13.645
Uh, there's five books.

59
00:03:13.645 --> 00:03:16.565
They're arranged in five books with about eight authors,

60
00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:17.965
maybe more than that.

61
00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:20.765
Books one and two. We just finished last week,

62
00:03:20.785 --> 00:03:22.565
mostly written by King David.

63
00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:26.385
And you'll notice today

64
00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:29.145
as you look at Psalm 73 right there somewhere,

65
00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:30.385
it should say book three.

66
00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:36.155
So book three opens with Psalm 73 goes through Psalm 89,

67
00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:40.675
and most of these are written by a man named asap.

68
00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:43.555
You'll see maybe a super script right there

69
00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:47.475
underneath Psalm 73, Psalm written by asap.

70
00:03:47.575 --> 00:03:49.515
So who is this ASAP character?

71
00:03:49.515 --> 00:03:53.075
It would be helpful to know before we dive in to Psalm 73.

72
00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:57.995
ASAP appears several times in one Chronicles chapter six

73
00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.595
and 16 and 25

74
00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:04.315
and some other places, he's a Levite.

75
00:04:04.935 --> 00:04:07.595
And if you remember, the sons of Levi, the descendants

76
00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:12.275
of Levi were assigned by God to take care of the tabernacle

77
00:04:12.275 --> 00:04:16.355
or the the temple King David even assigned some

78
00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:17.435
of them to lead worship.

79
00:04:18.455 --> 00:04:21.795
So when you went to the temple, you heard worship music

80
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.915
and ASAP was one of those worship leaders.

81
00:04:24.975 --> 00:04:28.315
So he's a songwriter, he's a skilled musician,

82
00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:29.915
the Bible says, and even a prophet,

83
00:04:31.455 --> 00:04:34.075
and he's more than uh, uh, 12

84
00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:38.475
Psalms are attributed to asap.

85
00:04:38.535 --> 00:04:40.395
So this is asap.

86
00:04:40.475 --> 00:04:43.355
I wish we had time to dive in a little more deeply on

87
00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:45.515
who the man is, but we have a long

88
00:04:45.525 --> 00:04:46.715
Psalm ahead of us this morning.

89
00:04:46.775 --> 00:04:47.875
So I want to dive right in.

90
00:04:48.105 --> 00:04:52.075
What does ASAP want us to know in Psalm 73?

91
00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:54.955
Well, if you'll join me there, let's read it together,

92
00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:55.995
28 verses.

93
00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:57.835
But this is fantastic.

94
00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:03.615
Psalm says this verse one, truly God is good

95
00:05:03.795 --> 00:05:07.175
to Israel to those who are pure in heart.

96
00:05:08.035 --> 00:05:10.615
But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled.

97
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:15.205
My steps had nearly slipped for I was envious

98
00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:18.765
of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

99
00:05:19.145 --> 00:05:23.685
For they had no pains or pain until death.

100
00:05:23.695 --> 00:05:27.285
Their bodies were fat and sleek, meaning healthy.

101
00:05:28.645 --> 00:05:30.415
They are not in trouble as others are.

102
00:05:30.415 --> 00:05:32.695
They are not stricken like the rest of mankind.

103
00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:35.575
Therefore, pride is their necklace.

104
00:05:36.015 --> 00:05:37.695
Violence covers them as a garment.

105
00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:41.415
Their eyes swell out through fatness.

106
00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:43.095
Don't you hate when that happens?

107
00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:47.535
They didn't have the word bulge back in that day.

108
00:05:48.475 --> 00:05:50.615
Uh, their eyes were bulging, greedy.

109
00:05:52.225 --> 00:05:56.095
Their hearts overflow with follies, they scoff

110
00:05:56.115 --> 00:05:58.605
and speak with malice or hatred.

111
00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:02.485
Lawfully. They threaten oppression.

112
00:06:02.485 --> 00:06:04.285
They set their mouths against the heavens

113
00:06:04.285 --> 00:06:05.925
and their tongues struts through the earth.

114
00:06:06.555 --> 00:06:08.645
Therefore, his people turn back to them

115
00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:10.405
and find no fault in them and

116
00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:12.165
and they say, how can God know

117
00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:16.075
as their knowledge in the most high behold,

118
00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:19.515
these are the wicked always at ease

119
00:06:20.495 --> 00:06:21.995
and they increase in riches.

120
00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:25.635
So he is looking around and he sees the wicked,

121
00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:27.355
how good they have it, and then he looks at

122
00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:29.515
himself and look what he says.

123
00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:33.755
Verse 13, all in vain have I kept my heart clean

124
00:06:33.815 --> 00:06:37.905
and washed my hands in innocence for all day long.

125
00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:39.785
I've been stricken and rebuked every morning.

126
00:06:40.765 --> 00:06:42.305
If I had said I will speak,

127
00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:44.985
thus I would've betrayed the generation of your children.

128
00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:49.785
He didn't want to admit his doubts of God to anybody else.

129
00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:55.885
Verse 16. But when I thought how to understand this,

130
00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:59.685
it seemed to me a wearisome task until I went

131
00:06:59.705 --> 00:07:01.245
to the sanctuary of God

132
00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:04.805
and then I discerned their end.

133
00:07:05.855 --> 00:07:07.805
Truly, you set them in slippery places.

134
00:07:07.945 --> 00:07:09.565
You make them fall to ruin

135
00:07:10.785 --> 00:07:13.805
how they are destroyed in a moment swept away utterly

136
00:07:14.345 --> 00:07:16.365
by terrors like a dream.

137
00:07:16.365 --> 00:07:20.245
When one awake so Lord, you rouse yourself, you despise them

138
00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:23.845
as phantoms or ghosts in a bad dream.

139
00:07:25.185 --> 00:07:27.355
When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked

140
00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:29.435
and hard, I was brutish and ignorance.

141
00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:31.835
I was like a beast towards you.

142
00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:35.275
Nevertheless, I am continually with you.

143
00:07:36.275 --> 00:07:39.215
You hold my right hand, you guide me with your counsel

144
00:07:40.035 --> 00:07:42.535
and afterward you'll receive me to glory.

145
00:07:44.205 --> 00:07:46.385
And then he finishes with this, whom have I in heaven

146
00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:50.905
but you and there is nothing on earth I desire besides you.

147
00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:55.895
My flesh and my heart may feel that God is the strength

148
00:07:55.895 --> 00:07:58.375
of my heart and my portion forever.

149
00:07:59.805 --> 00:08:02.785
For behold, those who are far from you shall perish.

150
00:08:03.325 --> 00:08:05.985
You put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you.

151
00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:09.825
But as for me, it is good to be near God.

152
00:08:10.855 --> 00:08:14.335
I have made the Lord God my refuge that I may tell

153
00:08:14.355 --> 00:08:15.375
of all your works.

154
00:08:16.685 --> 00:08:18.475
Let's pray together and ask God to

155
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.475
bless our time and his word.

156
00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:25.355
Lord, we're grateful for Psalm 73 this morning, grateful for

157
00:08:25.865 --> 00:08:28.035
ASAP and the wisdom that you've given him.

158
00:08:28.785 --> 00:08:33.175
Help us apply the truth of your word today

159
00:08:33.275 --> 00:08:37.215
to our lives and let us see our circumstances in a new

160
00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:39.655
eternal perspective.

161
00:08:40.725 --> 00:08:42.535
It's in Christ name we pray. Amen.

162
00:08:45.845 --> 00:08:48.895
Well, in Psalm 73, Asaf has a crisis

163
00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:52.135
of faith, a crisis of faith.

164
00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:54.935
Have you ever had a crisis of faith, maybe circumstances

165
00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:58.245
that challenged what you believe

166
00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:01.925
or maybe something that's pushed you so far

167
00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:05.205
that you doubted God or distrusted God?

168
00:09:07.055 --> 00:09:08.705
What do you do in a moment like that?

169
00:09:08.805 --> 00:09:10.945
How do you respond to a crisis of faith?

170
00:09:10.945 --> 00:09:15.145
Well, let me first define a crisis just

171
00:09:15.145 --> 00:09:16.345
so we're all on the same page.

172
00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:17.705
I'm gonna give you two definitions.

173
00:09:18.435 --> 00:09:21.665
First definitions from Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary.

174
00:09:22.865 --> 00:09:26.025
A crisis is the decisive state of things

175
00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:28.945
or the point of time when an affair has arrived at its

176
00:09:28.945 --> 00:09:32.385
height and must soon terminate

177
00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:34.065
or suffer a change.

178
00:09:35.695 --> 00:09:39.625
Note the word change here, crisis leads to change.

179
00:09:40.595 --> 00:09:44.305
dictionary.com, little more modern definition,

180
00:09:44.425 --> 00:09:46.345
a crisis is a turning point for better

181
00:09:46.445 --> 00:09:48.345
or worse, a condition of instability

182
00:09:48.345 --> 00:09:50.985
or danger leading to

183
00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:53.545
a decisive change.

184
00:09:55.205 --> 00:09:58.055
Both definitions tell us that crisis

185
00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:00.455
produces change.

186
00:10:01.485 --> 00:10:03.735
Something has to change.

187
00:10:04.315 --> 00:10:05.775
Either the crisis changes

188
00:10:06.795 --> 00:10:09.935
or you do something has to change.

189
00:10:10.155 --> 00:10:11.935
That's what the word crisis means.

190
00:10:12.715 --> 00:10:15.375
The truth is though, you're always going to have

191
00:10:16.545 --> 00:10:18.375
crazy circumstances in your life,

192
00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:22.205
you're always gonna have crises, right?

193
00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.565
You're either in a crisis

194
00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:25.565
or you're about to go into a crisis

195
00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:26.885
or you're coming out of a crisis

196
00:10:27.345 --> 00:10:30.445
or always have crazy circumstances in our life.

197
00:10:30.545 --> 00:10:33.925
So what needs to change is not the fact

198
00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.205
that we're gonna have crises, but how we view them,

199
00:10:37.745 --> 00:10:40.945
our perspective of our circumstances,

200
00:10:41.085 --> 00:10:43.905
and asaps gonna help us by sharing his experience.

201
00:10:44.385 --> 00:10:45.745
I have broken down this long

202
00:10:46.845 --> 00:10:50.585
28 verse Psalm into three sections.

203
00:10:51.115 --> 00:10:53.305
First, Asaf encounters a crisis.

204
00:10:53.395 --> 00:10:55.185
We'll look at a crisis that he encounters.

205
00:10:56.045 --> 00:10:58.745
Second ASAP evaluates his crisis,

206
00:10:58.885 --> 00:11:02.385
and third Asaf ends his crisis.

207
00:11:03.415 --> 00:11:06.505
What changes? Let's look a little more closely at these

208
00:11:06.505 --> 00:11:07.945
three sections.

209
00:11:08.495 --> 00:11:11.145
What crisis did Asaf encounter?

210
00:11:12.455 --> 00:11:14.305
What crisis did Asaf encounter?

211
00:11:14.305 --> 00:11:16.225
Look back at verses two and three with me.

212
00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:20.745
He started with my feet nearly slipped. Why?

213
00:11:21.245 --> 00:11:22.505
Why did his feet nearly slip?

214
00:11:22.645 --> 00:11:25.305
He, he says this, I was envious

215
00:11:25.525 --> 00:11:29.425
of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked,

216
00:11:30.145 --> 00:11:32.705
I saw how good bad people had it

217
00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:34.945
and then I began to look at myself.

218
00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:38.865
Look at verses 13 and 14, all in vain.

219
00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:42.065
What a waste of time have I kept my heart clean

220
00:11:43.045 --> 00:11:46.265
and wash my hands in innocence for all day long?

221
00:11:46.335 --> 00:11:48.145
I've been stricken and rebuked every morning.

222
00:11:49.825 --> 00:11:52.205
So what's the crisis that he's facing here?

223
00:11:53.155 --> 00:11:54.605
He's looking around at the world

224
00:11:54.665 --> 00:11:57.485
and he sees bad people have it so good

225
00:11:59.065 --> 00:12:02.045
and good people have it so bad.

226
00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:06.125
That's the crisis that he's facing.

227
00:12:06.145 --> 00:12:09.805
If you look at verse four, bad people live pain-free lives.

228
00:12:11.025 --> 00:12:14.385
So he thinks also in verse four,

229
00:12:14.445 --> 00:12:16.145
the wicked are healthy and strong.

230
00:12:18.165 --> 00:12:20.675
Verse five, they don't have troubles like everyone else.

231
00:12:21.775 --> 00:12:24.755
Verses six through nine, they are prideful and cruel

232
00:12:24.895 --> 00:12:26.715
and yet they have it all.

233
00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:31.245
Verse 11, they boast that God is ignorant

234
00:12:31.265 --> 00:12:32.845
and he can't see what's going on.

235
00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:36.525
Verse 12, they are at ease

236
00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.405
and they're increasing and they're riches.

237
00:12:40.045 --> 00:12:42.465
And then verse 16, he tries to understand it

238
00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:44.185
and he just can't make sense of it all.

239
00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:49.535
Now, ASAP has done all the right things and his mind

240
00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:53.415
and yet these evil people were better off than he

241
00:12:54.195 --> 00:12:56.055
was and that's not fair.

242
00:12:58.755 --> 00:13:00.725
Have you ever said those words, that's not fair.

243
00:13:02.335 --> 00:13:04.875
Or why God,

244
00:13:05.975 --> 00:13:08.675
why am I suffering when other people aren't?

245
00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:11.905
Why do I have to go through this?

246
00:13:13.045 --> 00:13:14.585
Why is this happening to me?

247
00:13:16.955 --> 00:13:20.895
How can there be a good God with all the evil in the world?

248
00:13:23.475 --> 00:13:28.365
God must not be just or loving. Don't you love me?

249
00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:30.795
God, we've all been there.

250
00:13:32.225 --> 00:13:35.565
How do you reconcile what you see and feel

251
00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:39.315
and experience with

252
00:13:39.315 --> 00:13:40.715
what you know about God?

253
00:13:40.785 --> 00:13:43.595
Your faith in God? Be very, very careful right here.

254
00:13:44.025 --> 00:13:48.115
There's a ditch that believers often fall into

255
00:13:48.935 --> 00:13:51.555
and you'll notice that ASAP nearly di if you look back at

256
00:13:51.555 --> 00:13:54.435
verse two, he said, my feet almost stumbled.

257
00:13:55.115 --> 00:13:56.195
I almost fell right here.

258
00:13:57.625 --> 00:14:01.745
'cause of my circumstances, my steps nearly slipped. Why?

259
00:14:02.615 --> 00:14:04.425
When you're in these crazy circumstances

260
00:14:04.565 --> 00:14:06.705
or you have a crisis, you really have two options

261
00:14:07.445 --> 00:14:09.025
and Asaf had both options.

262
00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:10.665
Here are your two options.

263
00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.385
You can either trust God with your circumstances

264
00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:19.235
or you can trust your understanding of your circumstances.

265
00:14:21.685 --> 00:14:23.465
You can trust God with your circumstances

266
00:14:23.565 --> 00:14:27.585
or you can trust your understanding of your circumstances.

267
00:14:27.765 --> 00:14:31.625
Now you are familiar with Proverbs three, five, trust

268
00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:35.505
in the Lord Solomon says with all your heart

269
00:14:36.325 --> 00:14:41.025
and do not lean on your own understanding in all your ways,

270
00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:45.225
even your difficulties, even your hard circumstances.

271
00:14:45.295 --> 00:14:48.945
Acknowledge him and he will make straight your past.

272
00:14:49.365 --> 00:14:51.365
In the first half of Psalm 73, 3,

273
00:14:51.835 --> 00:14:54.645
Asaf is evaluating his circumstances

274
00:14:55.355 --> 00:14:56.645
with his own understanding

275
00:14:57.715 --> 00:14:59.935
and we do that all the time, don't we?

276
00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:01.935
He came to verse 16.

277
00:15:01.995 --> 00:15:04.695
He actually uses the word, when I thought how

278
00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:08.855
to understand this, it seemed to me a weary some task.

279
00:15:08.955 --> 00:15:10.535
He couldn't make sense of it all.

280
00:15:11.865 --> 00:15:14.565
In fact, his understanding led him

281
00:15:14.585 --> 00:15:17.325
to assume some wrong conclusions about God.

282
00:15:18.295 --> 00:15:22.125
God's not fair. God's not just God doesn't love me.

283
00:15:24.005 --> 00:15:25.305
He almost abandoned his faith.

284
00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:27.225
He says, I almost stumbled, almost fell.

285
00:15:27.975 --> 00:15:31.825
Wait, that's the ditch that I warned about.

286
00:15:33.575 --> 00:15:37.195
Please hear me. We often are guilty

287
00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:39.795
of evaluating God's character

288
00:15:41.595 --> 00:15:46.465
by our circumstances when we should be evaluating our

289
00:15:46.465 --> 00:15:48.665
circumstances by God's character.

290
00:15:50.585 --> 00:15:52.605
That's a lot of words, but lemme say that again.

291
00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:57.125
We are often guilty of evaluating or judging God

292
00:15:58.105 --> 00:16:00.165
and his character by our circumstances.

293
00:16:01.665 --> 00:16:02.965
God, I know you're this,

294
00:16:03.145 --> 00:16:06.725
but look what's happening to me just like ASAP was doing

295
00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:09.165
when we should be evaluating our

296
00:16:09.365 --> 00:16:12.045
circumstances by God's character.

297
00:16:12.045 --> 00:16:16.505
What do I mean? Go back to verses 16 and 17.

298
00:16:16.505 --> 00:16:18.905
This is the turning point of Psalm 73.

299
00:16:20.135 --> 00:16:23.905
When I thought how to understand this, Asaf says, it seemed

300
00:16:23.905 --> 00:16:28.105
to me a weary some task until I went

301
00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:29.865
to the sanctuary of God

302
00:16:31.005 --> 00:16:33.385
and then I discerned there end

303
00:16:35.655 --> 00:16:38.785
asap went to the sanctuary of God, he went to the temple,

304
00:16:39.985 --> 00:16:43.765
the place where God dwelled in Jerusalem,

305
00:16:45.765 --> 00:16:48.145
the place of worship where he led music

306
00:16:49.945 --> 00:16:52.805
and they were reminded of all the Psalms of David

307
00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:57.175
and he began to ponder the truth in those psalms

308
00:16:57.175 --> 00:16:59.535
and he began to realize, I've got it all wrong.

309
00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:03.285
He began to have his eyes opened

310
00:17:03.385 --> 00:17:05.045
and he began to have a new perspective.

311
00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:08.005
It was in the sanctuary of God

312
00:17:08.595 --> 00:17:11.805
that he got an eternal perspective.

313
00:17:13.085 --> 00:17:14.225
His eyes were open.

314
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:18.005
He saw the big picture in the sanctuary

315
00:17:18.005 --> 00:17:20.485
of God when he turned his attention to God

316
00:17:20.825 --> 00:17:24.525
and contemplated who God is and what he says.

317
00:17:25.425 --> 00:17:30.065
He came to his senses. Verse 17, I discerned therein.

318
00:17:30.225 --> 00:17:35.165
I realized where I was wrong in the wrong ways

319
00:17:35.165 --> 00:17:37.905
that I was thinking I wanna stop right here

320
00:17:37.925 --> 00:17:41.905
and stress the significance of scripture intake.

321
00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:46.135
Scripture intake may not have ever heard that phrase before,

322
00:17:46.195 --> 00:17:49.445
but you and I must regularly be reading,

323
00:17:49.965 --> 00:17:53.935
studying God's word, scripture, intake, taking it in,

324
00:17:55.265 --> 00:17:57.315
absorbing it, meditating on it.

325
00:17:57.975 --> 00:18:00.475
You and I need to be at church.

326
00:18:01.175 --> 00:18:03.915
You need to be in a small group Bible study.

327
00:18:03.915 --> 00:18:07.595
You need to be exposing yourself to sound

328
00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:10.195
biblical teaching regularly.

329
00:18:10.535 --> 00:18:15.395
Why? Because these things remind us of who God is

330
00:18:15.575 --> 00:18:19.475
and what he says, and we can evaluate our circumstances in

331
00:18:19.475 --> 00:18:21.275
light of who he is and what he says.

332
00:18:23.785 --> 00:18:25.245
Go to the sanctuary of God.

333
00:18:25.245 --> 00:18:29.085
You're familiar with Psalm 1 19, 1 0 5, thy word is a

334
00:18:29.635 --> 00:18:33.245
lamp into my feet and a light into my path.

335
00:18:33.295 --> 00:18:37.125
We've got to be regularly going to the sanctuary of God,

336
00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:38.605
going into the presence of God.

337
00:18:39.045 --> 00:18:43.245
I know God is with you all of the time. He's for believers.

338
00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:45.245
He's indwelling you, but you know what I mean.

339
00:18:45.245 --> 00:18:48.045
Getting in the presence of God, getting into God's word,

340
00:18:48.045 --> 00:18:51.325
getting into God's house helps you to see

341
00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:54.885
your circumstances with an eternal perspective.

342
00:18:56.065 --> 00:18:58.045
Be careful not to evaluate

343
00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:01.445
or judge God's character by your circumstances.

344
00:19:02.185 --> 00:19:05.165
Rather evaluate your circumstances by God's character.

345
00:19:05.435 --> 00:19:10.225
What does that mean? Evaluate your circumstances in light of

346
00:19:10.325 --> 00:19:11.745
who God is.

347
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:16.025
In other words, don't start with your circumstances

348
00:19:16.165 --> 00:19:17.345
and try to figure things out.

349
00:19:19.395 --> 00:19:21.705
Don't start with your understanding.

350
00:19:22.275 --> 00:19:24.025
Don't go to the world

351
00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:26.865
and see what the world has to say about your circumstances.

352
00:19:27.635 --> 00:19:30.505
Start with God. Take every thought captive.

353
00:19:30.975 --> 00:19:33.445
Paul would say, what does that mean?

354
00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:38.385
Here's what I mean by that. Ask yourself these questions.

355
00:19:38.575 --> 00:19:40.385
What does God say about himself?

356
00:19:41.335 --> 00:19:44.325
What does God say about you?

357
00:19:46.515 --> 00:19:51.355
What does God say about your circumstances,

358
00:19:52.215 --> 00:19:53.235
the world around you?

359
00:19:53.235 --> 00:19:54.835
What does God have to say about this?

360
00:19:54.835 --> 00:19:57.675
Start with him and not your understanding.

361
00:19:57.965 --> 00:19:59.755
Where do we find the answers to those things?

362
00:19:59.755 --> 00:20:01.035
We find them in God's word.

363
00:20:02.135 --> 00:20:05.115
Listen, in a time of crisis, which we're all going through

364
00:20:05.965 --> 00:20:08.755
crazy circumstances, current events right now,

365
00:20:08.755 --> 00:20:12.875
right in our country, it's important that you go

366
00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:16.315
to God's word and speak truth to yourself.

367
00:20:17.845 --> 00:20:20.515
Speak truth to yourself just like Philippians four,

368
00:20:20.515 --> 00:20:25.275
eight says, whatever is true, think on those things.

369
00:20:26.765 --> 00:20:29.335
It's important when your circumstances are crazy,

370
00:20:29.945 --> 00:20:31.135
speak truth to yourself.

371
00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:34.975
That's what asaps gonna do. He meditates on four truths.

372
00:20:35.015 --> 00:20:37.455
I wanna walk you through the four truths

373
00:20:37.455 --> 00:20:38.535
that he meditates on.

374
00:20:39.425 --> 00:20:41.815
Truth number one in a crisis.

375
00:20:43.195 --> 00:20:44.895
Truths you need to tell yourself.

376
00:20:44.995 --> 00:20:48.605
You need to remind yourself. Truth number one, God is good.

377
00:20:50.925 --> 00:20:55.545
God is good. I don't mean that he can do good sometimes.

378
00:20:55.825 --> 00:20:59.185
I mean he is good and he can't do anything else

379
00:20:59.565 --> 00:21:02.715
but good God is good.

380
00:21:04.595 --> 00:21:08.555
I love that this psalm begins in verse one.

381
00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:12.075
Truly God is good.

382
00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:17.665
ASAP knows it, but watch what he does. He makes a mistake.

383
00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:23.115
God is good, but the next word is in the next verse,

384
00:21:23.255 --> 00:21:26.305
but God is good,

385
00:21:26.525 --> 00:21:29.425
but as for me, I look at my circumstances,

386
00:21:30.525 --> 00:21:31.705
that's a very important

387
00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:35.935
but right there when you put a

388
00:21:35.955 --> 00:21:38.055
but in that sentence, God is good,

389
00:21:38.155 --> 00:21:42.255
but you're gonna focus on whatever comes after the but

390
00:21:44.115 --> 00:21:46.495
and negate what came before the buts.

391
00:21:48.565 --> 00:21:50.525
I know God is this,

392
00:21:51.025 --> 00:21:54.395
but we can't do that.

393
00:21:55.455 --> 00:21:59.865
God is good, period. No but's about it, right?

394
00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:03.065
He is good. We can't do that.

395
00:22:03.385 --> 00:22:04.905
Remember, don't evaluate God's character

396
00:22:04.905 --> 00:22:05.905
by your circumstances.

397
00:22:07.105 --> 00:22:09.225
Evaluate your circumstances by God's character.

398
00:22:10.605 --> 00:22:12.385
We also know Romans 8 28,

399
00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:15.985
God works all things for good.

400
00:22:17.215 --> 00:22:18.345
He's not only good,

401
00:22:18.365 --> 00:22:21.465
but he works all things for good to those who love him,

402
00:22:22.445 --> 00:22:24.465
to those who are called according to his purpose.

403
00:22:25.045 --> 00:22:27.785
Listen to that. God is good.

404
00:22:28.445 --> 00:22:32.065
He has a good plan and a good purpose for you.

405
00:22:33.645 --> 00:22:36.225
Now, please hear that His good

406
00:22:36.925 --> 00:22:39.025
is not the world's version of good.

407
00:22:42.005 --> 00:22:46.285
It may not include good health or wealth

408
00:22:46.545 --> 00:22:49.965
and stuff or fame or a position.

409
00:22:50.615 --> 00:22:53.245
God's good for you is your sanctification.

410
00:22:54.205 --> 00:22:57.995
Verse Thessalonians four, three, that you

411
00:22:59.105 --> 00:23:01.315
conform to the image of his son,

412
00:23:01.315 --> 00:23:03.475
that you become more like Christ,

413
00:23:03.495 --> 00:23:04.915
that's God's good in your life

414
00:23:05.295 --> 00:23:09.115
and sometimes that requires difficulties in your life.

415
00:23:09.935 --> 00:23:11.715
Can God conform you to the image

416
00:23:11.715 --> 00:23:13.715
of his son while you have an easy life?

417
00:23:16.095 --> 00:23:17.255
I know you don't want to hear that

418
00:23:18.055 --> 00:23:19.495
'cause we all pray, Lord, give me an easy

419
00:23:19.605 --> 00:23:22.415
life, but wait a minute.

420
00:23:23.355 --> 00:23:28.085
An eternal perspective is Lord, make me more like Christ

421
00:23:29.485 --> 00:23:32.985
and that requires difficulties in your life.

422
00:23:34.285 --> 00:23:38.385
God is good and he'll use your circumstances for good truth.

423
00:23:38.385 --> 00:23:39.825
Number one, you can trust him.

424
00:23:40.955 --> 00:23:45.805
Truth number two, ASAP reminds himself, God is is sovereign.

425
00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:49.515
God is sovereign. It's a big word.

426
00:23:49.575 --> 00:23:52.875
It just means that he's in control of all things,

427
00:23:53.025 --> 00:23:55.715
even your life and your circumstances.

428
00:23:56.385 --> 00:24:01.015
Even the wicked, look at verse 18.

429
00:24:01.805 --> 00:24:05.295
Once he goes to the sanctuary and he, his eyes are open

430
00:24:05.295 --> 00:24:06.735
and he gets an eternal perspective.

431
00:24:06.785 --> 00:24:11.215
Verse 18, truly you God set them the wicked

432
00:24:11.835 --> 00:24:12.975
in slippery places.

433
00:24:14.115 --> 00:24:15.855
You make them fall to ruin

434
00:24:16.395 --> 00:24:18.495
how they are destroyed in a moment swept away

435
00:24:18.495 --> 00:24:19.655
utterly by terrors.

436
00:24:21.115 --> 00:24:23.965
Wait a minute. If God sets the wicked

437
00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:26.725
and slippery places, God is in control.

438
00:24:29.055 --> 00:24:33.195
If he causes them to fall to ruin, God is in control.

439
00:24:33.375 --> 00:24:34.435
God is sovereign.

440
00:24:35.025 --> 00:24:38.195
Even when we think things are out of control,

441
00:24:38.335 --> 00:24:39.395
he is in control.

442
00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:44.895
Verse 27, skip down to 27 for behold, those

443
00:24:44.915 --> 00:24:48.935
who are far from you will perish talking about the wicked

444
00:24:49.795 --> 00:24:52.255
you have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.

445
00:24:52.715 --> 00:24:53.975
God is not only sovereign

446
00:24:53.975 --> 00:24:57.775
but in his sovereignty, he is the judge of all men.

447
00:24:57.865 --> 00:25:02.415
Small and great. God is the judge. He's your judge.

448
00:25:03.755 --> 00:25:05.575
God is sovereign and he's judged.

449
00:25:06.475 --> 00:25:08.255
Things might seem out of control.

450
00:25:09.735 --> 00:25:11.995
The wicked might seem like they are prospering,

451
00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:14.755
but they have to answer to him one day.

452
00:25:15.935 --> 00:25:18.155
It may not be today, but it will be in his time.

453
00:25:18.335 --> 00:25:21.475
God will judge all men small and great

454
00:25:21.695 --> 00:25:24.955
and many of them will be destroyed.

455
00:25:25.015 --> 00:25:28.565
He will sentence them to destruction.

456
00:25:29.235 --> 00:25:32.705
Asaf says, and he's right. God is good.

457
00:25:32.715 --> 00:25:35.825
Truth number one, God is sovereign. He's in control.

458
00:25:36.215 --> 00:25:37.905
Even when you think things are outta control,

459
00:25:38.415 --> 00:25:39.505
he's in control.

460
00:25:39.845 --> 00:25:43.545
You can trust him. Truth number three,

461
00:25:46.155 --> 00:25:49.015
God has perfect understanding.

462
00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:54.625
You do not. Neither do I.

463
00:25:56.435 --> 00:25:57.695
God has perfect understanding.

464
00:25:57.695 --> 00:26:01.055
What I mean by that is he's wise, he's all wise.

465
00:26:01.195 --> 00:26:05.695
He knows what he's doing. He knows why things are happening.

466
00:26:06.435 --> 00:26:08.975
We don't necessarily, our understanding is deficient.

467
00:26:09.725 --> 00:26:13.435
It's lacking and ASAP recognizes that.

468
00:26:13.435 --> 00:26:15.075
Look at verses 21 and 22.

469
00:26:16.605 --> 00:26:17.725
Remember, he's in the presence of God.

470
00:26:17.725 --> 00:26:19.005
He's getting an eternal perspective

471
00:26:19.005 --> 00:26:23.205
and he says this, when my soul was embittered,

472
00:26:23.205 --> 00:26:25.885
when I was angry with you, God pricked in hard.

473
00:26:25.885 --> 00:26:28.965
He was torn up inside I was brutish.

474
00:26:29.945 --> 00:26:34.035
British means without sense. I was senseless and ignorant.

475
00:26:34.115 --> 00:26:37.155
I was foolish. He's admitting his shortcomings.

476
00:26:37.635 --> 00:26:40.475
I was like a beast, an animal just reacting

477
00:26:40.475 --> 00:26:41.715
to my circumstances.

478
00:26:41.785 --> 00:26:44.765
Animals react, right?

479
00:26:44.765 --> 00:26:46.565
They don't think through things, they just react.

480
00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:50.685
I was like a beast Before you, God, notice why

481
00:26:51.355 --> 00:26:53.085
Asaf was brutish and ignorance.

482
00:26:53.395 --> 00:26:54.525
This is very interesting.

483
00:26:54.985 --> 00:26:57.805
He was embittered and pricked and hard.

484
00:26:57.805 --> 00:27:01.005
He was torn up inside. In other words, his thoughts,

485
00:27:01.705 --> 00:27:06.165
his emotions, his feelings got the better of him.

486
00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:12.485
Did you hear that? Sometimes your thoughts, your emotions,

487
00:27:12.485 --> 00:27:13.925
your feelings get the better of you

488
00:27:13.925 --> 00:27:17.325
and that's why God says, trust in me with all your heart

489
00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:21.045
and do not lean on your understanding

490
00:27:22.755 --> 00:27:24.565
because your understanding is going

491
00:27:24.565 --> 00:27:26.365
to be tainted by your emotions.

492
00:27:26.365 --> 00:27:29.405
What you're going through at the moment. Don't do that.

493
00:27:29.475 --> 00:27:31.885
Your understanding is deficient, his is not.

494
00:27:33.845 --> 00:27:36.565
I wanna just go off on a tangent, a couple

495
00:27:36.565 --> 00:27:38.845
of points right here that I thought of as I was thinking

496
00:27:38.845 --> 00:27:42.285
through how we understand things, our perspective

497
00:27:42.305 --> 00:27:44.125
of things and a couple of things.

498
00:27:44.205 --> 00:27:48.675
I think ASAP notes ASAP saw

499
00:27:48.695 --> 00:27:50.275
how good the wicked had it

500
00:27:50.295 --> 00:27:53.315
and he thought that he should envy them.

501
00:27:53.315 --> 00:27:54.395
Look again at verse three.

502
00:27:54.515 --> 00:27:58.475
I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the

503
00:27:58.475 --> 00:27:59.675
prosperity of the wicked.

504
00:28:02.175 --> 00:28:04.465
When you're trying to understand things around you,

505
00:28:04.645 --> 00:28:05.905
you need to understand this.

506
00:28:07.045 --> 00:28:09.995
Other people are not your standard for imitation.

507
00:28:13.565 --> 00:28:17.555
Other people are not your standard for imitation.

508
00:28:17.775 --> 00:28:19.675
God is your standard for imitation.

509
00:28:21.145 --> 00:28:23.715
Paul said, imitate me as I imitate Christ.

510
00:28:27.085 --> 00:28:30.055
When you focus on what others have or what others do

511
00:28:30.155 --> 00:28:32.095
or don't do or don't have to do,

512
00:28:34.035 --> 00:28:38.585
you get discouraged, you get discontent.

513
00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:41.465
When you begin to look around you

514
00:28:41.485 --> 00:28:46.265
and look at compare your lot to others, all

515
00:28:46.265 --> 00:28:47.305
of a sudden you're unhappy.

516
00:28:47.645 --> 00:28:50.025
You're angry with God saying That's not fair.

517
00:28:52.095 --> 00:28:56.975
Take some time to look at all the pronouns used in Psalm

518
00:28:56.975 --> 00:29:00.335
73 verses four through 12.

519
00:29:00.395 --> 00:29:02.655
He starts out with they, they get to do this

520
00:29:02.715 --> 00:29:04.215
and they get to do that and

521
00:29:05.795 --> 00:29:07.855
and then about halfway through verses 13

522
00:29:07.875 --> 00:29:11.415
and 17, he's looking at himself, I don't have this

523
00:29:11.475 --> 00:29:13.655
and I don't have that and my life's miserable.

524
00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:15.295
He's looking at other people

525
00:29:15.395 --> 00:29:16.975
and he's comparing them to himself

526
00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:20.455
and he doesn't come to his senses until verses 18 to 28.

527
00:29:21.435 --> 00:29:24.655
All of a sudden, the pronouns change to you God.

528
00:29:26.125 --> 00:29:28.185
He got his eyes off of what was around him

529
00:29:28.205 --> 00:29:30.785
and turned his eyes to the Lord.

530
00:29:34.435 --> 00:29:35.745
Don't focus your attention on

531
00:29:35.745 --> 00:29:37.305
what others are doing what they have.

532
00:29:37.555 --> 00:29:38.945
Focus your attention on the Lord

533
00:29:39.965 --> 00:29:41.420
and you'll get a right perspective.

534
00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:43.885
Second little tangential note here,

535
00:29:46.855 --> 00:29:47.865
ASAP looks at the world

536
00:29:48.005 --> 00:29:51.715
and he believes that they are better off than he is.

537
00:29:52.615 --> 00:29:55.915
Listen, the world is not better off than you are.

538
00:29:57.715 --> 00:30:01.005
It's easy to think that sometimes, but it's not true.

539
00:30:02.565 --> 00:30:04.425
The world might seem successful

540
00:30:05.085 --> 00:30:07.865
and rich Bible tells us in God's eyes

541
00:30:08.415 --> 00:30:09.905
they're poor and miserable.

542
00:30:12.675 --> 00:30:17.585
Their lives are shallow, unstable, slippery,

543
00:30:18.135 --> 00:30:21.665
ASAP says they're chasing things that don't last,

544
00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:24.865
that don't matter, that don't count.

545
00:30:24.965 --> 00:30:28.425
In the end, your life is built on the rock.

546
00:30:28.955 --> 00:30:31.745
Their life is built on the sand.

547
00:30:32.525 --> 00:30:36.305
During difficult circumstances, you have a faith

548
00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:37.465
that is eternal

549
00:30:37.605 --> 00:30:42.385
and unshakeable worth the sacrifice

550
00:30:42.385 --> 00:30:43.505
that you're having to go through.

551
00:30:45.415 --> 00:30:47.085
Truth number one, God is good.

552
00:30:48.325 --> 00:30:51.425
God is sovereign and he has perfect understanding.

553
00:30:52.245 --> 00:30:56.155
You can trust him. Truth number four,

554
00:30:56.425 --> 00:30:59.955
ASAP reminds himself that despite your failures,

555
00:31:00.255 --> 00:31:01.875
God is faithful.

556
00:31:03.705 --> 00:31:05.915
Despite your failures, God is faithful.

557
00:31:05.935 --> 00:31:08.355
He will never leave you or forsake you.

558
00:31:08.375 --> 00:31:11.475
The Bible says He walks with you

559
00:31:11.825 --> 00:31:13.595
through your circumstances.

560
00:31:13.815 --> 00:31:17.395
God is faithful. Look at verses 23 and 24.

561
00:31:18.395 --> 00:31:19.755
Nevertheless, he says,

562
00:31:19.755 --> 00:31:24.475
after all he said, nevertheless, despite all of that,

563
00:31:25.355 --> 00:31:27.035
I am continually with you.

564
00:31:28.065 --> 00:31:32.605
You hold my right hand like a father does, a child

565
00:31:33.115 --> 00:31:35.365
with your counsel, with your words.

566
00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:37.765
You guide me again like a father

567
00:31:38.845 --> 00:31:41.665
and afterward receive me to glory.

568
00:31:42.915 --> 00:31:44.375
You know, you and I are prone

569
00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:47.015
to abandon God when things get difficult,

570
00:31:48.155 --> 00:31:49.615
he will never abandon us.

571
00:31:52.265 --> 00:31:54.005
We can trust him to keep his promises.

572
00:31:54.005 --> 00:31:57.605
We can trust him to keep his word even though we don't

573
00:31:58.115 --> 00:32:00.565
regularly keep our promises or keep our word.

574
00:32:00.665 --> 00:32:03.245
God is faithful. He was faithful yesterday.

575
00:32:03.815 --> 00:32:07.325
He'll be faithful to you today. He'll be faithful tomorrow.

576
00:32:09.715 --> 00:32:13.195
God is faithful. Asaf nearly

577
00:32:13.225 --> 00:32:15.365
slipped or stumbled.

578
00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:20.225
Rather than evaluating God's character by his circumstances,

579
00:32:20.365 --> 00:32:21.945
he evaluated his circumstances

580
00:32:22.685 --> 00:32:24.985
by God's character and you know what?

581
00:32:25.085 --> 00:32:29.215
His crisis came to an end. Let's finish up here.

582
00:32:30.235 --> 00:32:33.975
How did as a's crisis end simple.

583
00:32:34.545 --> 00:32:38.475
There was a change. Remember the definition

584
00:32:38.475 --> 00:32:39.650
of crisis at the beginning.

585
00:32:40.065 --> 00:32:42.405
Crisis produces change,

586
00:32:43.985 --> 00:32:45.405
so what changed?

587
00:32:47.245 --> 00:32:48.655
Well, you'll find out

588
00:32:48.655 --> 00:32:50.895
that a ASAP circumstances didn't change,

589
00:32:50.955 --> 00:32:53.255
but his perspective of them did.

590
00:32:54.125 --> 00:32:58.445
Your circumstances may not change,

591
00:32:59.665 --> 00:33:02.965
but your perspective of your circumstances can change.

592
00:33:04.645 --> 00:33:09.505
You and I have very little control in this world.

593
00:33:09.625 --> 00:33:10.985
I hope you figured that out by now.

594
00:33:11.655 --> 00:33:13.385
There's very little that you can control.

595
00:33:14.005 --> 00:33:17.585
You can't control much of what happens to you, but you

596
00:33:17.605 --> 00:33:22.185
and I have 100% control of how we respond to

597
00:33:22.185 --> 00:33:23.225
what happens to us.

598
00:33:25.895 --> 00:33:28.595
Let me say that again. You may not be able to control

599
00:33:28.595 --> 00:33:30.755
what happens to you, but you can control

600
00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:32.835
how you respond to what happens to you.

601
00:33:34.275 --> 00:33:37.235
I said earlier, the truth is you will always have crazy

602
00:33:37.235 --> 00:33:38.675
circumstances in your life.

603
00:33:38.975 --> 00:33:41.355
If you're not going through them now, you're about to.

604
00:33:44.885 --> 00:33:45.955
Those aren't gonna change.

605
00:33:46.865 --> 00:33:51.155
What can change our perspective of our circumstances.

606
00:33:51.825 --> 00:33:53.795
When you know who God is

607
00:33:54.855 --> 00:33:57.875
and what he says, then your crises,

608
00:33:58.225 --> 00:34:00.995
your crazy circumstances won't overwhelm you.

609
00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:08.915
Notice how ASAP finishes Psalm 73, verse 25.

610
00:34:12.135 --> 00:34:16.455
After all he is been through, I almost slipped.

611
00:34:16.615 --> 00:34:18.375
I almost stumbled. I tried to figure this out.

612
00:34:18.455 --> 00:34:21.615
I got into God's presence. He got an eternal perspective.

613
00:34:21.805 --> 00:34:24.895
He's reminded himself of the truths that

614
00:34:25.435 --> 00:34:26.815
who God is and what he says.

615
00:34:26.875 --> 00:34:30.865
He says this, whom have I in heaven but you.

616
00:34:32.805 --> 00:34:36.305
He reminds himself that the focus comes back to God.

617
00:34:37.135 --> 00:34:38.745
Whom have I in heaven but you

618
00:34:38.925 --> 00:34:43.235
and there's nothing that I desire besides you.

619
00:34:44.455 --> 00:34:49.035
As long as I have the Lord, he's all I need is

620
00:34:49.035 --> 00:34:50.115
what ASAP is saying.

621
00:34:51.875 --> 00:34:53.725
He's come full circle here, hasn't he?

622
00:34:54.735 --> 00:34:57.215
A relationship with God? Let them have their money.

623
00:34:57.755 --> 00:34:59.975
Let them have their prosperity. Let 'em have their health.

624
00:35:02.015 --> 00:35:04.275
All I want is God.

625
00:35:05.345 --> 00:35:09.465
He's the only thing I desire on this earth.

626
00:35:09.815 --> 00:35:11.705
Have you come to that place in your life

627
00:35:14.205 --> 00:35:17.915
where you've recognized that there's nothing on this earth

628
00:35:18.825 --> 00:35:23.535
that you need, nothing on this earth will satisfy you.

629
00:35:25.215 --> 00:35:28.355
You could have it all and you would be disappointed.

630
00:35:29.525 --> 00:35:32.315
Empty, shallow and miserable.

631
00:35:33.855 --> 00:35:37.085
Don't believe me. Just read some of the biographies

632
00:35:37.145 --> 00:35:41.185
of the wealthiest people in the world, musicians

633
00:35:41.285 --> 00:35:43.305
and athletes and movie stars.

634
00:35:44.665 --> 00:35:47.005
You can have it all and be disappointed and shallow

635
00:35:47.185 --> 00:35:52.005
and miserable, whom have I in heaven but you.

636
00:35:53.725 --> 00:35:55.055
Your hope in this life

637
00:35:55.315 --> 00:35:57.095
and the next is

638
00:35:58.995 --> 00:36:00.555
not anything in this world.

639
00:36:00.985 --> 00:36:03.355
Your hope in this life in the next is Christ.

640
00:36:05.365 --> 00:36:06.825
He is all you need.

641
00:36:07.375 --> 00:36:09.505
Whom have I in heaven but Christ

642
00:36:10.565 --> 00:36:13.105
and nothing on this earth I desire but him.

643
00:36:13.445 --> 00:36:14.465
Can you say that today

644
00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:19.755
as SAS circumstances had not changed,

645
00:36:19.935 --> 00:36:23.435
but his perspective of them had changed?

646
00:36:25.745 --> 00:36:26.875
Look at verse 26.

647
00:36:28.745 --> 00:36:31.125
My flesh and my heart may fail,

648
00:36:31.265 --> 00:36:35.485
but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

649
00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:41.155
Remember, he said, the wicked are are uh, healthy

650
00:36:41.335 --> 00:36:44.155
and strong, and I wanna be healthy and strong.

651
00:36:44.255 --> 00:36:47.995
I'm sick all the time. Right? He was comparing himself.

652
00:36:48.295 --> 00:36:51.355
Now he says, you know what? His perspective has changed.

653
00:36:52.215 --> 00:36:54.075
My flesh and my heart may fail.

654
00:36:54.775 --> 00:36:57.115
God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

655
00:36:58.335 --> 00:37:00.795
At some point, your heart

656
00:37:00.855 --> 00:37:02.995
and your flesh, your body will fail.

657
00:37:04.625 --> 00:37:08.085
If the Lord doesn't come back, death awaits us all.

658
00:37:09.715 --> 00:37:12.325
Your body is temporary.

659
00:37:12.955 --> 00:37:16.685
It's broken, it's weak, it's fragile,

660
00:37:19.085 --> 00:37:20.535
it's perishable.

661
00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:23.695
Paul says, and the next, you can't take your body

662
00:37:23.695 --> 00:37:24.815
with you into the next life.

663
00:37:24.815 --> 00:37:28.255
It's perishable. You need an imperishable body in the next

664
00:37:28.285 --> 00:37:30.905
life and there's only one person

665
00:37:31.045 --> 00:37:33.265
who can give you an imperishable body.

666
00:37:33.855 --> 00:37:38.555
It's Christ. You'll

667
00:37:38.705 --> 00:37:39.955
lose this body

668
00:37:39.975 --> 00:37:42.755
and you'll be given a glorified body

669
00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:45.725
without any frailties.

670
00:37:46.845 --> 00:37:50.195
Sicknesses. My heart

671
00:37:50.815 --> 00:37:53.075
and my flesh may fail me,

672
00:37:53.075 --> 00:37:57.275
but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

673
00:37:57.415 --> 00:38:00.035
He will give you eternal life.

674
00:38:00.185 --> 00:38:04.355
Life without any frailties. Sicknesses.

675
00:38:07.795 --> 00:38:10.015
His perspective has changed even though his

676
00:38:10.015 --> 00:38:11.335
circumstances have not.

677
00:38:13.725 --> 00:38:16.015
Finally, he finishes in verses 27

678
00:38:16.035 --> 00:38:20.235
and 28 verse 28.

679
00:38:20.235 --> 00:38:21.875
We've mentioned 27 verse 28.

680
00:38:22.335 --> 00:38:24.235
As for me, it is good to be near God.

681
00:38:25.475 --> 00:38:28.995
I have made the Lord God my refuge that I may tell

682
00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:31.115
of all your works.

683
00:38:33.155 --> 00:38:36.245
Remember, he started off with, I know God is good,

684
00:38:36.345 --> 00:38:37.485
but this is what I see.

685
00:38:38.475 --> 00:38:39.485
He's come full circle

686
00:38:39.625 --> 00:38:44.405
and he says, it is good for me to be near God.

687
00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:47.965
I've made him my refuge. I desire nothing else.

688
00:38:48.185 --> 00:38:52.385
You are all I have. Forget my circumstances.

689
00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.965
I want to be near God.

690
00:38:57.075 --> 00:38:59.135
He ends by saying, basically, I want

691
00:38:59.135 --> 00:39:00.375
to be near God at all times.

692
00:39:01.875 --> 00:39:03.755
I want to trust him at all times.

693
00:39:03.995 --> 00:39:06.355
I want to tell others about him at all times.

694
00:39:07.065 --> 00:39:08.835
That is life right there.

695
00:39:09.615 --> 00:39:14.395
To know Christ, to be like Christ,

696
00:39:14.575 --> 00:39:17.355
to be with Christ, to tell others about Christ.

697
00:39:19.865 --> 00:39:21.775
Asaps circumstances have not changed,

698
00:39:22.945 --> 00:39:25.645
but his perspective of them had.

699
00:39:27.325 --> 00:39:28.965
I want to close with an illustration.

700
00:39:29.775 --> 00:39:32.085
We're all familiar with a solar eclipse,

701
00:39:35.245 --> 00:39:36.455
smaller object.

702
00:39:36.725 --> 00:39:39.695
Moon blocks a larger object, the sun,

703
00:39:40.555 --> 00:39:45.085
and for a few moments we stand in darkness.

704
00:39:47.695 --> 00:39:51.115
Now, for centuries, solar eclipses have caused

705
00:39:51.775 --> 00:39:53.395
people a lot of anxiety.

706
00:39:54.155 --> 00:39:57.775
People have been afraid of solar eclipses thinking

707
00:39:57.775 --> 00:39:59.015
that they were bad omens

708
00:39:59.015 --> 00:40:00.015
or the world was gonna come

709
00:40:00.015 --> 00:40:01.455
to an end or we're all gonna die.

710
00:40:03.085 --> 00:40:07.845
But you and I know the truth of a solar eclipse today.

711
00:40:09.315 --> 00:40:12.255
Yes, for a few moments we're gonna be in the

712
00:40:12.255 --> 00:40:16.045
dark, but just hold on.

713
00:40:16.065 --> 00:40:17.725
The sun is still there

714
00:40:19.105 --> 00:40:23.085
and we will be in the sun in just a few minutes.

715
00:40:23.185 --> 00:40:28.095
The light will shine. I know

716
00:40:28.095 --> 00:40:29.975
a lot of you are going through some difficult

717
00:40:29.975 --> 00:40:31.255
circumstances right now.

718
00:40:32.495 --> 00:40:34.125
Again, if you're not, you will be soon.

719
00:40:36.325 --> 00:40:37.825
It is so tempting for us

720
00:40:39.325 --> 00:40:43.065
to let our circumstances attract our attention away from God

721
00:40:43.165 --> 00:40:46.655
and and judge his character based on

722
00:40:46.655 --> 00:40:47.655
what we're experiencing,

723
00:40:47.755 --> 00:40:52.415
but we must not allow our circumstances to eclipse

724
00:40:52.955 --> 00:40:54.815
our faith in God.

725
00:40:55.425 --> 00:40:58.215
Don't let any smaller object

726
00:40:59.395 --> 00:41:02.055
get in your way of seeing your God.

727
00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:06.095
Your God is much, much bigger than any circumstance

728
00:41:06.235 --> 00:41:07.775
or crisis you may face.

729
00:41:09.505 --> 00:41:12.595
Don't panic, don't fear.

730
00:41:14.915 --> 00:41:16.745
Trust the Lord with all your heart.

731
00:41:16.795 --> 00:41:18.865
Don't lean on your own understanding.

732
00:41:20.985 --> 00:41:24.675
Evaluate your circumstances in light of

733
00:41:24.695 --> 00:41:26.275
who God is and what he says.

734
00:41:27.845 --> 00:41:30.565
He is good. He is sovereign.

735
00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:33.055
He is wise and his.

736
00:41:33.145 --> 00:41:37.595
His understanding is perfect and he's faithful.

737
00:41:37.655 --> 00:41:40.765
You can trust him no matter what you're going through.

738
00:41:41.715 --> 00:41:43.445
Your circumstances may not change,

739
00:41:43.545 --> 00:41:45.565
but your perspective of them can.
