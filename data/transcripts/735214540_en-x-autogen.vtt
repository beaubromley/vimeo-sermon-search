00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.000
if you

2
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.600
Good morning church. My name is TR Lewis like John said

3
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.100
and it's a pleasure to get to be with you

4
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.400
this morning opening God's word and worshiping so thank you to Joe and

5
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.600
the worship team for leading us this this

6
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.300
month through the month of July. Henderson Hills has been blessed

7
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.300
to have over 100 Years of cumulative preaching

8
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.500
experience in the pulpit.

9
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
And this is my second time. So we'll bring the average

10
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.300
down a little bit today.

11
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.500
But but praise God that he uses Broken Vessels.

12
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.100
To preach his word. We pray that the spirit this morning would open our

13
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.600
hearts. So let's do that this morning in prayer.

14
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.000
Father God as we come to your word.

15
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.000
May we do it humbly.

16
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.700
May we let your word do the work?

17
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.400
Of conviction, maybe we

18
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.000
let your spirit.

19
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.700
Do the work.

20
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.600
of opening

21
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.000
our eyes and our hearts to your truth.

22
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.500
Jesus name we pray amen.

23
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.500
Amen, well my family and I've been here for about 18 years

24
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.800
at Henderson Hills, and we've loved

25
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.200
Henderson Hills and you guys have loved us very well over this

26
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.300
time.

27
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.300
And about a year in about a year into our time here at Henderson Hills

28
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.000
Mike wall.

29
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.300
Invited me to go on a medical mission trip

30
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.100
to Indonesia to do a medical relief trip

31
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.000
after the the devastating tsunami to hit

32
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.100
in 2004 and and I

33
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.000
was humbled when he asked me to do that and when

34
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.300
I say humbled, I mean really proud that he asked

35
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.100
me to do that. There's a little

36
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.200
bit of a mix and I I pray those in my medical training. I

37
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.200
was in my residency at that time and I'd pray that God would start to open that door

38
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.300
for medical missions. I've done some of that earlier in

39
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.100
life, but was really eager to do more.

40
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.500
And about a week before we were supposed to leave on that

41
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.100
trip. I was at work at the

42
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.000
hospital on a call shift.

43
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.300
And I had experienced a pain

44
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.400
in my chest that I had not known before to

45
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.700
that degree.

46
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.800
See for years.

47
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.300
For years before this. I've been having these little pains in

48
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.200
my chest that would that would get me down. It was

49
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.800
usually after a long bike ride or a workout and I've

50
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.200
had it checked out when I was in high school never really

51
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.600
got an answer as to what it was.

52
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.200
But in that moment on that day that pain took me to my

53
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.400
knees and I could I couldn't breathe well, and I

54
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.800
had to had to seek help.

55
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.100
And the doctor years before had said if you're

56
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.100
in the middle of one of these episodes go find and get

57
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.900
a chest x-ray.

58
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.200
And so as I found myself in the

59
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.600
ER it was easy. So I I got a

60
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.300
chest x-ray that day. I hadn't for years for a decade. I'd ignored

61
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.400
that.

62
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.300
And when that x-ray got developed it showed that my left lung

63
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.200
was 30% collapsed and so it explained it was

64
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.000
the answer to what had been plaguing me all those years.

65
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.300
It was the answer that required a treatment.

66
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.200
So I wrestled in that I had that week of man. I

67
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.200
really want to go and all my doctors that were training me said you

68
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.000
can't you can't go forward with this. You have to get it fixed.

69
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.100
And so I sat in Mike's office with tears and

70
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.500
told him that I wasn't going to be able to go but I had to submit.

71
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.200
To having that problem surgically treated and so I did.

72
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.300
See I was I was used to being the one diagnosing the problem.

73
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.600
I was used. I was in training to fix the problem I had

74
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.200
on I was the one in the scrubs and the white coat. I wasn't supposed to

75
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.300
be the one having the surgery.

76
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.300
But I did and the Lord used that time in a

77
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.100
really really special way.

78
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.200
You see I was broken physically in that time and it revealed

79
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.800
a need for help.

80
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.600
The X-ray gave the diagnosis, but the X-ray

81
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.200
didn't make my lung collapsed. They merely

82
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.600
gave the answer.

83
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.300
It and I'd use that line. I'd use that phrase with

84
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.400
patience that that this MRI this didn't give

85
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.300
you whatever your problem is, but now it is a step towards

86
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.800
fixing it.

87
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.700
But for me, that was a little bit hard to hear myself.

88
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.400
So today we look at God's word. Look at his Passage.

89
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.500
And we want to see our hearts the way

90
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.500
God sees them.

91
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.400
We want to see them for how they really are.

92
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.100
So today just to put everybody kind of

93
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.600
at ease a little bit. We're going to answer we're gonna fill in all the blanks on

94
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.300
your notes first.

95
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.000
So our theme is seen seeing God's heart the way he

96
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.400
does.

97
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.000
The next line on there is God sees our sin.

98
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.700
He sees our sin.

99
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.700
The second one is God knows our heart.

100
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.300
He can see our hearts and he knows

101
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.200
our hearts.

102
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.200
The third line in your notes is God has made a

103
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.800
way to make us clean.

104
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.500
He sees our sin our sin separates us from him and he has

105
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.700
made a way to make us clean.

106
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.000
The fourth line is he is just and

107
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.200
he is just a fire.

108
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.200
He is just and he is just a fire and in him. We are

109
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.700
Justified.

110
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.800
In him, we are Justified.

111
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.200
So we got out of the way so I don't have to worry about touching all those points and you guys

112
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.800
can listen. You've got your notes filled out.

113
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.300
So you can sit back and relax and

114
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.700
enjoy.

115
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.600
But this morning we're going to turn in your turn your Bibles to Luke chapter

116
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.600
18, we're gonna be studying verses 9 through

117
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.600
14. And as we read Jesus's words, he's speaking

118
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.800
to a very prideful bunch.

119
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.000
And so as we read these words if you catch yourself thinking I know

120
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.200
who really needs to hear this.

121
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.900
I've got this golf buddy or a Facebook friend or my

122
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.000
kids or my spouse.

123
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.400
If you're thinking that beware.

124
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.300
If you get through this passage, you have a list of who you're going to send the link

125
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.000
to afterwards.

126
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.100
Let's think again.

127
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.200
So let's come to the passage.

128
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.500
Luke chapter 18 verses 9 through 14 he told this Parable

129
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.100
to some who trusted in themselves that they

130
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.300
were righteous and treated others with

131
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.900
contempt.

132
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.500
So he told this story.

133
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.400
Two men went up into the temple to pray one a

134
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.600
Pharisee and the other tax collector.

135
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.700
the Pharisee standing by himself prayed thus

136
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.000
God I thank you that I'm not like the other men.

137
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.900
Extortioners unjust adulterers or

138
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.000
even like this tax collector. I fast

139
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.600
twice a week. I give tithes of

140
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.400
all that I get.

141
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.500
But the tax collector standing far off would not even lift up his

142
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.500
eyes to heaven.

143
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.600
He beat his breast.

144
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.800
Saying God be merciful to me a sinner.

145
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.300
I tell you this man went down to

146
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.800
his house Justified rather than the other for everyone

147
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.500
who exalts himself will be humbled. But the one who humbles

148
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.900
himself will be exalted.

149
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.400
this reading this morning the story that

150
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.200
Jesus tells is one of self-righteousness on

151
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.500
the part of the Pharisee resulting in Pride and his

152
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.100
looking on others is truly an example of not seen

153
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.400
our own Hearts the way that God does.

154
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.300
So let's take a few minutes to kind of walk through this story. We're

155
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.600
going to look at some of the details better and see how we

156
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.100
can take away from this story and how it can affect our

157
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.400
lives.

158
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.200
And really this is a story within a story right this the

159
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.700
grander story is Luke telling his

160
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.800
holy and spirit Holy Spirit inspired.

161
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.200
count of Jesus's life

162
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.200
and in the middle of this the middle of Jesus on the

163
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.200
road traveling meeting people and teaching we have this story of

164
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.200
two guys walk into a temple, right?

165
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.500
And so for the for the previous nine chapters of

166
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.200
Luke Jesus has been in this midst of

167
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.000
a journey towards Jerusalem. He's progressing towards Jerusalem

168
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.900
and we see glimpses of his teaching glimpses of

169
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.400
his interactions with the Pharisees and tax collectors

170
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.400
all along the way.

171
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.300
And so he's he's journeying towards you somewhere at this

172
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.400
point between Galilee and Jericho.

173
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.400
And all along he's teaching he's healing he's being

174
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.000
challenged.

175
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.200
He's really he's just one chapter ways towards the end. He's just

176
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.200
one chapter away from riding into Jerusalem on the Donkey.

177
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.700
And so this isn't the first time he's been challenged by

178
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.000
the Pharisees. This isn't his first message. In fact

179
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.200
two chapters earlier. If you look at if you look back just flip a page back probably

180
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.900
to Luke 16

181
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.300
He gives a very clear word to the Pharisees in Luke chapter 16

182
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:46.900
verse 15.

183
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.300
They just challenged him about his teaching. He says you were

184
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.800
those who justify yourself before men.

185
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.900
But God knows your heart.

186
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.200
For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the

187
00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.800
side of God.

188
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.400
But apparently that didn't do the trick that that didn't

189
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.200
resonate with them in some way and so he goes on he teaches

190
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.400
his disciples more in this

191
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.200
first part of chapter 18 about prayer and then he

192
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.000
moves on to the story.

193
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.300
These two guys walk into a temple.

194
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.200
But of course, they're not any two guys.

195
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.700
It's a Pharisee and a tax collector.

196
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.600
And so

197
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.400
although we see the Pharisees as bad guys and the

198
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.800
tax collectors is the perennial hero of the story.

199
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.500
That's not how they would have viewed that that's not how the dusty people

200
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.300
sitting around. Jesus's feet would have heard

201
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.700
this story at first.

202
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.000
I seen the Pharisees were actually the religious Elite of

203
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.300
the day.

204
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.000
They were the ones who put forward the facade of righteousness. They

205
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.400
were the ones who upheld Jewish teaching and

206
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.300
law and even exceeded it in the way that they lived.

207
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.400
They prided themselves in being righteous examples and going beyond

208
00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.800
the law.

209
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.400
And the tax collectors they were the they were the most demised.

210
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.300
So let's look a little bit so the tax collectors.

211
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.800
Reserve they regarded himself as these Pious preservers

212
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.300
of the law.

213
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.200
And is interesting they didn't have this wasn't like a bestowed title. This

214
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.100
was someone who chose.

215
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.400
To walk this extra Road they added on

216
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.800
to God's law.

217
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.500
They had no official power, but they put forward this

218
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.700
extra holiness.

219
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.500
In an attempt to Garner a respect

220
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.400
among the people, right? Certainly all

221
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.500
the Pharisees had fish stickers on the backs of their cars,

222
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.100
right?

223
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.000
And this week we were talking with some friends

224
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.300
of my life reminded me early in our relationship and our

225
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.100
dating relationship. I gave her a fish placard the nice silver one

226
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.700
to go in the back of her car.

227
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.600
And I assured her in that moment that if she had the fish placard

228
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.100
on the back of her car then she would be safe from

229
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.800
ever getting pulled over having a ticket.

230
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.200
This is not a story only made for the pull but this is a real story.

231
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.200
That night driving home from her house. I got pulled over.

232
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.900
With a fish placard on the back of my car and went

233
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.600
away from there with not one but two tickets for my

234
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.800
infractions at night.

235
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.300
But it wouldn't have been uncommon to see the Pharisees in the temple.

236
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.300
It wasn't unusual for Pharisees to come into the temple.

237
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.400
And actually they had they would go they had their regular seats even right

238
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.900
and they would assume those.

239
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.400
But Jesus wasn't fooled.

240
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.500
He could see their hearts and if you look back at Matthew 23 later

241
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.600
this week, you'll see how Jesus really felt about the Pharisees

242
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.400
and the scribes.

243
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.300
So what about the tax collector?

244
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.100
A tax collectors were the black hat Cowboys. They were the bad

245
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.300
guys.

246
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.500
Right, they would have seldom be seen darkening the doorsteps

247
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.200
of the Temple.

248
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.300
most of them were Jewish

249
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.700
a lot of them like we think Matthew had something happen earlier

250
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.400
in his life. Mostly had something where they went away. They turned away

251
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.200
from their Jewish Heritage. They turned away from their

252
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.400
faith and they became sellouts to the Romans.

253
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.100
They were collecting taxes to the for the Romans from their Hebrew

254
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.900
Brethren, but they were also extortioners right

255
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.300
they were robbing. They were cheating.

256
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.400
their brothers

257
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.600
he was it wasn't natural for them to continue to associate

258
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.400
they were considered separated but in

259
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:23.700
a bad way.

260
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.400
So we have to put aside kind of our VBS lenses where

261
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.200
we know the Pharisees a bad guy. We know the tax collector or

262
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.000
something good is going to happen and we can why we want to watch this

263
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.900
story evolve.

264
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.000
So let's look at their postures as they enter the temple.

265
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.100
It says in Luke and the ESV that both of them came in

266
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.100
they stood right?

267
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.200
But in the Greek those words for stand are very different.

268
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.000
The Greek word for standing used of the Pharisee is

269
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.400
one of assuming his regular

270
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.600
seat, right? He was standing with pride.

271
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.900
He was standing as if he deserved to be there.

272
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.900
in the presence of God

273
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.500
Not necessarily bad, but

274
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.700
it is if you carry that pride in your

275
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.000
heart.

276
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.000
The word stand we see for the tax collector is a

277
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.400
timid attitude. It even says that he was standing far

278
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.300
off. He wasn't even in the same part of the temple. He didn't he

279
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.600
didn't feel himself equal to that.

280
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.600
And he stood with a timid way even a different word used.

281
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.400
And he had his head hung. He wouldn't lift. He

282
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.100
couldn't lift.

283
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.300
His eyes up.

284
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:35.500
to the Lord

285
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.400
So in this physical expression of their

286
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.800
spiritual conditions, we see these two men come and

287
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.100
do the temple.

288
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.400
But what about their prayers as Jesus unpacks their

289
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.300
prayers we start to really see their heart.

290
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.100
And really the Pharisees prayer isn't as much of a prayer

291
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.100
as it is a self-righteous Soliloquy before

292
00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:57.400
God.

293
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.500
He's laying out all the things that he is not

294
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.500
and he lays out all the reasons that God should

295
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.700
love him.

296
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.500
First he thinks God that he is not like other men. He thanks

297
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.900
God that he's not an extortioner. He's not unjust. He's

298
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.100
not an adulterer.

299
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.800
And he punctuates it by saying I'm not like this other

300
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.200
man this tax collector.

301
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.600
It seems as though he was aware of his surroundings

302
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.200
aware of what was going on and even from a surface

303
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.200
level presentation of

304
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.500
We we see that God reveals. Jesus is revealing. This

305
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.900
Pharisee is prideful.

306
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.600
He's using comparison of himself with others as

307
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.500
a means to.

308
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.200
Cover up the sin. That's really in his

309
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.300
life.

310
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.600
It gives him a self-assurance. It gives himself.

311
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.600
Justification as he makes these comparisons.

312
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.100
But then he moves on he moves on to boast about

313
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.400
his holy actions of the things

314
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.200
that he does.

315
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.100
Above and beyond the law first. He boasts about

316
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.800
his fasting.

317
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.400
Jewish law at that time required that they fast once a

318
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:07.400
year.

319
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.800
And that on the day of atonement.

320
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.200
In this Pharisee boasts before God that he fasts twice a

321
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:14.300
week.

322
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.200
To celebrate Moses going to the mountain and coming back

323
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:18.400
down.

324
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.300
a few days later

325
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:21.500
and so he

326
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.200
he's boasting this righteous action before God.

327
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.400
He boasts about as fasting.

328
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.500
the exact opposite

329
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.500
of what we're called to do of what Jesus teaches us

330
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.000
to do.

331
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.300
He talks about.

332
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.200
his tithing

333
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.300
he logs his time and he Tides everything that

334
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.900
he gets was common for the Pharisees and that day to tithe

335
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.200
off spices and herbs in every

336
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.400
single thing and it was above and beyond what that Mosaic

337
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.500
law had commanded.

338
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.200
So the the self-inflated practice of the

339
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.700
Pharisees in general particularly this one that we read of today, it

340
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.400
left no room for a need for savior.

341
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.300
their attempts

342
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.500
Filling the law and going beyond the law themselves.

343
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.200
Put everything on their plate.

344
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.200
But these practices were meaningless to God

345
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.400
because he could see their hearts.

346
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.500
And now we see the tax collector the tax collector

347
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.800
standing far off and another part of the temple with his head

348
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.600
hung.

349
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.500
He was ashamed of his sin, but he didn't run from

350
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:36.800
God.

351
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.500
He came to the temple to pray and to plead with God for

352
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.000
mercy.

353
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.500
And I believe that this is evidence of the work of the holy spirit in his

354
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:46.600
life.

355
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.300
Even before he entered the temple that day if there

356
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.300
was something that brought him in.

357
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.000
There was something that brought him into that place before God.

358
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.200
He knew that he could go there and receive Mercy. It may

359
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.400
have been a lesson that he learned as a child.

360
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.200
Even before he left and turned

361
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.100
to his his life as a tax collector.

362
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.400
And the prayer the tax collector is one that can serve as a model for

363
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:14.800
us today.

364
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.700
When we're faced with a Brokenness of sin.

365
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.200
And as much as the Pharisees heart was full of Pride. The tax

366
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.900
collectors was overcome with Brokenness and

367
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.600
humility.

368
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.700
So we read his plea to the Lord. He says

369
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.900
these words God be merciful

370
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.400
to me a sinner.

371
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.900
He got it, right.

372
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.600
With hot tears and a burning throat. He confessed his sinfulness to

373
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.200
the only one who could forgive and wash away

374
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.900
his sins.

375
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.100
And as we read this prayers, we read these words of the

376
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.300
tax collector reminded of Psalm 51.

377
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.600
And Psalm 51 David is praying a

378
00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.100
similar prayer.

379
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.800
In the first three verses he says have mercy

380
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.300
on me o God.

381
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.500
According to your steadfast love according to your abundant Mercy

382
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.400
bought out my transgressions.

383
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.200
Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me

384
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.100
from my sin for I know that my transgressions

385
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.300
And my sin is ever before me.

386
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.000
David had received the diagnosis of his Brokenness and

387
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.000
he went to go be healed from it.

388
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.200
And we see the reality of this working out in

389
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.700
verse 17 later in the chapter.

390
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.800
or David says

391
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.200
the sacrifices of God or a broken

392
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:38.700
spirit

393
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.300
a broken and contrite heart o God,

394
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.700
you will not despise.

395
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.600
And that's exactly what we see the tax collector bringing before

396
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.400
God a broken spirit.

397
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.000
A broken and contrite Hearts. You

398
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.600
see he doesn't boast in himself.

399
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.000
He asks only for mercy.

400
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.100
So the tax collector saw his sin the way

401
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:03.800
that God did.

402
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.700
And in these seven words that he prays he impacts the

403
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.500
whole truth of the gospel for us.

404
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.900
He starts out with God. He cries out to God His Holy Father our

405
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.800
Holy Father.

406
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.900
the god of Mercy

407
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.300
he confesses that he is a sinner.

408
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.400
In fact, he confesses that he is the

409
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.300
sinner the way it's phrase. The originally says

410
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.400
I Am The Sinner as if you were the only one

411
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.100
and he is he's only one for God before God.

412
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.500
We see him beat his breast. He's not beating his

413
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.700
hands. He's not beating his mind. He's beating his chest his

414
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.200
heart.

415
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.900
As if he knows where the root of his sin is,

416
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.500
he's attacking that root of sin and

417
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.200
then he pleads for mercy.

418
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.400
I need Mercy.

419
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.100
He seeks Mercy from our merciful god.

420
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.600
And we see a translated as mercy and in other words for the translation of

421
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.700
that in the Greek is propitiate me God be

422
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.300
merciful to me propitiate me.

423
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.000
And that's one of my favorite words that used in the New Testament as

424
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.500
John and Paul used propitiation to describe

425
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.900
Christ atoning sacrifice for us.

426
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.400
And that's a word that we don't we don't throw around much propitiation, but

427
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.500
it means atonement.

428
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.300
It means paying the price that we couldn't pay on

429
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.200
our own right?

430
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.500
It means appeasing a holy God for the penalty of

431
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.400
our sin.

432
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.900
And it's what Christ did for us you see Christ is

433
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.500
the propitiation for our sin and

434
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.000
also our propitiator.

435
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.400
It's a means of regaining favor a propitiation to

436
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.500
regains that favor that was lost in the

437
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:52.900
garden.

438
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.700
It's Christ's earning back a forgiveness that we couldn't earn

439
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.200
on our own through any tithing or fasting or

440
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.100
anything that we might do.

441
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.300
in first John

442
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.400
in Chapter 2 in chapter 4 there are two verses that John

443
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.500
teaches about this. He says my little children. I'm writing

444
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.700
these things to you that you may not sin.

445
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.200
But if anyone does sin we have an advocate with the father

446
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.200
Jesus Christ the righteous he is a

447
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.700
propitiation.

448
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.200
For our sins and not for

449
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.000
ours only but also for the sins of the

450
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.200
world.

451
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.400
And then he goes on to chapter 4 to say in this love not

452
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.600
that we have loved God, but that he loved us.

453
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.500
And sent his son to be the propitiation for our

454
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:36.800
sins.

455
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.400
Through that gift. It's through that propitiation that he averts

456
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.900
that Jesus averts the Wrath.

457
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.100
of our holy God

458
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.400
So in this short prayer the tax collector pleads for exactly what

459
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.100
he needs.

460
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.400
It's amazing how at times the Holy Spirit can

461
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.900
work a perfect understanding of this complex.

462
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.600
process

463
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:05.100
theologians have written volumes and volumes on mercy

464
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.400
and Grace and

465
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.700
salvation and propitiation and total

466
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.600
Reliance on God, but it's the tax collector gets

467
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.000
it he gets propitiation even without

468
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.200
the study

469
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:18.900
I think about a

470
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.800
high school student who can drain three-pointer after

471
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.400
three pointer, right or hit a

472
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.900
300 yard drive down the Fairway.

473
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.000
It would take professors.

474
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.400
Lecture Halls full of chalkboards to explain the physics and

475
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.300
the mechanics behind what it takes to do those

476
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.300
things and yet naturally people can just

477
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.200
do that in their gifting and that's that's similar to

478
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.400
how the Holy Spirit I think works in this tax collector. He

479
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.200
doesn't understand all the mechanics. He

480
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:49.900
just understands.

481
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.300
That the god before he

482
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.900
please his merciful.

483
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.600
And that this God sent his son Christ.

484
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.500
To forgive us of our sins and so the tax collector gets

485
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.800
propitiation.

486
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.700
He understands it.

487
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.200
You see we don't have to be theological Giants to come

488
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.000
before the cross.

489
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.600
We just have to be humbled by our sin and see our

490
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.800
hearts the way God sees them.

491
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.500
We have to recognize that separation that our sin.

492
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:23.900
creates

493
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.200
and then we have to remember that God made a way to make us clean. He

494
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.900
doesn't want us to stay separated. He doesn't want us to stay in our sin. He's

495
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.500
made a way to make us clean and he's made it through the washing

496
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.400
of the blood of Jesus Christ.

497
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.700
And what does the tax collector receive when he finishes his

498
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.700
prayer for mercy?

499
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.600
He went away Justified.

500
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.200
Jesus says that that man went down to his house Justified.

501
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.300
But not the other he makes a clear distinction that the

502
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.600
Pharisee was not justified by any of the things that he boasts

503
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:57.700
in.

504
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.900
And as we read about this justification, I

505
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.500
want to share a little excerpt. This

506
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.400
is Charles spurge and his commentary about this part of the story and

507
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.300
it was really neat and less you think that I read

508
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.900
a lot of Charles Spurgeon Alan shared this with me so credit to

509
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.000
him.

510
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.400
It says this is this is spurgeon's

511
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.200
words. This is all that Christ did for him was cast

512
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.200
about his shoulders to be the robe of

513
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:23.600
his Beauty.

514
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.700
That moment all the guilt that he had ever committed himself

515
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.800
was washed entirely away and

516
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.700
lost forever.

517
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.100
when a sinner believes in Christ his sins positively

518
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.200
cease to be

519
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.700
And what is more wonderful they all cease to be?

520
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.100
As Kent says in these well-known lines.

521
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.400
It's a poem.

522
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.000
It says here's pardon for the transgressions past

523
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:53.300
it matters not how black they're

524
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.400
cast.

525
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.100
And oh my soul with Wonder View.

526
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.600
For sins to come. Here's pardon,

527
00:25:59.600 --> 00:25:59.800
too.

528
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.600
They're all swept away in one solitary instant

529
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.700
the crimes of many years.

530
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.100
extortions adulteries or even

531
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:10.400
murder

532
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.800
wiped away in an instant

533
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.100
For you will notice the Absolution was instantaneously given.

534
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.500
He went away from that place.

535
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.200
Justified he went away from that place declared.

536
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.500
Holy declared innocent.

537
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.100
by his righteous judge

538
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.900
So let's learn about Justified. Let's learn about being made, right?

539
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.500
as Paul taught the Romans in chapter

540
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:43.700
3

541
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.100
Romans chapter 3 verses 21 through 28 28

542
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.400
Paul writes to the Romans he says but now the

543
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.400
righteousness of God has been manifested apart from

544
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:55.900
the law.

545
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.300
all of the law and the prophets bear witness to

546
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.600
it the righteousness of God through faith

547
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.800
in Jesus Christ for all who believe

548
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.800
amen for there is no distinction for

549
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.400
all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and

550
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.600
are Justified.

551
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.800
by his grace

552
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.400
as a gift

553
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.900
through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus.

554
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.400
whom God put forward

555
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.700
as a propitiation by his blood to be

556
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.700
received by faith.

557
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.300
This was to show God's righteousness because in

558
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.100
his Divine forbearance. He had passed over former sins.

559
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.700
It was to show his righteousness that the present time so

560
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.400
that he might be just and justifier of

561
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.700
the one who has faith in Jesus.

562
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.300
Then What Becomes of our boasting?

563
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.700
It is excluded.

564
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.100
By what kind of law by law of Works? No.

565
00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.900
by the law of faith

566
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.400
for we hold that one is justified by faith

567
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.100
apart from the works of the law.

568
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.900
See our God is just

569
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.400
and our God is also the justifier.

570
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.400
He sent his son.

571
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.700
to be the propitiation

572
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.900
the blood of Christ shed on our behalf.

573
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.800
We are forgiven.

574
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.800
And the Lord has declared his righteous.

575
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.300
Not through the law but through the blood.

576
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.300
Because on our own we're forsaken.

577
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.100
When we try to do it on our own.

578
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.200
We're without hope.

579
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.900
On our own we have every reason for despair.

580
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.000
We beat our chests and we hang our heads.

581
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.000
but in him

582
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.000
in Christ

583
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.900
We have been Justified. We've been declared righteous. Yes,

584
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.900
he sees our sin. Yes, we beat

585
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.300
our breasts over conviction. We

586
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.400
beat our hearts and repentance and our hatred

587
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.000
of our sin.

588
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.400
And yes, he knows he sees he

589
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.700
hears and yes, he loves us in that.

590
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.300
Yes, he declares this redeemed innocent and

591
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:07.900
holy.

592
00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.800
See Christ defeated our sin.

593
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.100
Through faith and repentance. He declares this. Holy.

594
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.400
Because of Christ and that is how

595
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.300
God sees the hearts of those who come

596
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.800
to him in faith.

597
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.100
He sees our hearts perfectly.

598
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.400
He sees our hearts completely.

599
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.700
We're fully known to him and we're fully loved in

600
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.200
Christ Jesus.

601
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.700
In him we too are Justified

602
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.700
just like the tax collector.

603
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.500
So we see the tax collector go away perfectly

604
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.700
Justified and then Jesus leaves us

605
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.200
with a mic drop paradox.

606
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.700
as he often does

607
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.300
those who exalt themselves will be

608
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:55.900
humbled.

609
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.000
And the humbled will be exalted.

610
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.400
He punctuates this parable.

611
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:02.700
with this

612
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.300
Jesus is known for teaching and upside

613
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.100
down life, right?

614
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.000
Lose your life to find it first will be last servant will

615
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.400
be the greatest.

616
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.300
Those who exalt themselves will be humbled.

617
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.400
And those who humble themselves will be exalted but none of this makes sense.

618
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.700
Except in the kingdom of God.

619
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.300
You see we have no need to make much of ourselves before God.

620
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.500
Because anything anything that we might bring is

621
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.800
like filthy rags.

622
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.900
And anything that's good in us as followers

623
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.400
of Christ is because of the work that the Holy Spirit has

624
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.200
done in our lives.

625
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.700
The friends we are Justified and we are exalted as

626
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.300
we trust in Christ. But what do we do with that? So what

627
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.400
do we do that as Brothers and Sisters in Christ who are

628
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.000
Justified?

629
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:55.400
number one

630
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.200
Don't be proud.

631
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.600
Right. There's a Temptation toward that as we

632
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.300
walk in sanctification.

633
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.600
Satan tries to bring up this temptation

634
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.200
towards Pride that maybe we're doing

635
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.000
a little bit of it.

636
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.400
on our own

637
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.100
so don't be proud.

638
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:16.900
number two

639
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.400
be honest with ourselves and with God about our

640
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:21.900
sin.

641
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.600
We need to continue to see our hearts the way God sees

642
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:25.800
them.

643
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.600
That's how we come to the cross at first and that's how we continue

644
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.000
to walk with Christ.

645
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.500
number three

646
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.400
We continue to plea for mercy and continue to rest upon Christ

647
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.700
as a propitiation for our sins.

648
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.100
We understand that our Salvation was bought by the blood of

649
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.500
Christ.

650
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.100
That there's nothing that we did to deserve it and nothing that

651
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:52.600
we could do.

652
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.600
We need to remind ourselves that it was done willingly by

653
00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.000
God.

654
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.600
Because of his love for us.

655
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.600
Not to appease an Angry God.

656
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.400
But to satisfy the holy Wrath of a

657
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.300
loving God.

658
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.600
What else do we do with our justification?

659
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.900
number four We Trust in it

660
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.300
We Trust in that justification

661
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.200
we see our heart the way God sees it now he sees us

662
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.500
as holy and redeeming so we don't let

663
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.300
the shame of sin continue because we

664
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.100
know that those sins have been forgiven.

665
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.400
and when Satan tries to hold those over our heads

666
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:37.900
we say no.

667
00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.700
We rest in the blood of Christ.

668
00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.300
We trust that we forgiven and have been made

669
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:45.600
clean.

670
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.500
We don't forget from where we've come but we rest that

671
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.800
we've been made clean and then walk in that identity.

672
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.700
We walk out first Thessalonians 5, right we pray continually

673
00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.300
we rejoice in all circumstances.

674
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.200
We give thanks.

675
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.300
We walk for his glory.

676
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.700
We walk with thankful hearts and we celebrate we celebrate the

677
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.100
work that God has done in US.

678
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.600
We Rejoice like Paul and Galatians 2 that we've been crucified

679
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.300
with Christ.

680
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.600
And that we no longer live, but Christ lives in US.

681
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.100
so the next question is

682
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.800
but what if I'm a Pharisee?

683
00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.100
What if outwardly?

684
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.700
I put forward this facade of righteousness, but inwardly.

685
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.500
I'm broken and sick and deflated.

686
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.300
What if I've tried to build my own righteousness apart from

687
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:48.500
God?

688
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.500
Well, I think what Jesus tells us is

689
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.800
those who exalt themselves will be humbled.

690
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.000
And that's a good place to be.

691
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.900
I would say if you say what if I'm a Pharisee, I

692
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.100
would say let the overwhelming love of God overtake you.

693
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.600
Let his truth let the word of God cover and

694
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.400
saturate you let it expose the true depth

695
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.600
of your need for him.

696
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.500
Stop ignoring sin.

697
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.200
Stop trying to fix or manage sin on your

698
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:22.400
own.

699
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.900
Stop playing the comparison game to help you deal with your sin.

700
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.900
Stop simply polishing that empty facade and

701
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.800
devoting yourself to appearances.

702
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.300
If we see ourselves as the Pharisee, we have to let our

703
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.900
walls of perception down.

704
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.500
And let me let you in all on a secret. We all still sin.

705
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.300
Every older every Church staff member every worship leader

706
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.500
every community group leader every student leader.

707
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.900
Every single person in this building and outside of this building.

708
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.700
Still has to deal with sin.

709
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.300
If you're the Pharisee like I at times in

710
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.100
the past have been the Pharisee and want to try to fix it.

711
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:11.200
don't

712
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.400
beat your breast beat your heart plead to

713
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.500
God for Mercy from Humble and can try

714
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.100
heart and receive justification.

715
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.500
Receive the justification that the tax collector

716
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.400
