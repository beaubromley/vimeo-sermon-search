00:00:02.345 --> 00:00:05.565
All throughout scripture, God's people clunked

2
00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:10.005
to his promises, promises

3
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:14.605
of a king who will come, a savior

4
00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:17.285
who will reign, a redeemer,

5
00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:19.445
who will bring light into the darkness.

6
00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:27.405
True Jesus. God's plan unfolds

7
00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:32.805
from promise to presents.

8
00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:39.005
Isn't that beautiful? Uh,

9
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:40.445
our team did a great job on that.

10
00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:42.165
We'll show that for the next few weeks.

11
00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:45.845
If you are new, uh, my name is John. I'd love to meet you.

12
00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.725
I'm one of the pastors here. I get to preach most

13
00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:50.045
of the time, and so it's an honor to do that.

14
00:00:50.345 --> 00:00:51.885
But it is an honor to meet you as well.

15
00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:54.645
Uh, if you are ready at some time,

16
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.725
whenever that is, you can scan that QR code in front of you

17
00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.245
or you can take that card out to the seat, out to the lobby

18
00:01:01.825 --> 00:01:03.405
and would meet someone there.

19
00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:06.605
We wanna help just connect you deeper in your faith, uh,

20
00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:07.885
hopefully to our church as well,

21
00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:09.765
but, uh, primarily to Jesus more

22
00:01:09.865 --> 00:01:11.805
so help us help you with that.

23
00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:16.005
Also, let me remind you that it is, uh, today,

24
00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:18.885
actually maybe tomorrow, I got one email this morning.

25
00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:21.645
The QR code that you'll see on the screen gets you the daily

26
00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:23.685
advent email leading up to Christmas.

27
00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:25.925
And so this is just a way for us to prepare together,

28
00:01:26.175 --> 00:01:27.885
Aaron Ferguson, put it together for us.

29
00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:29.605
Uh, make sure you're signed up for that.

30
00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:31.925
It's a great opportunity to prepare your heart

31
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.125
rightly for Christmas.

32
00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.125
If you miss it on the screen, it's on your notes

33
00:01:35.185 --> 00:01:37.485
as well if you didn't get that QR code in time.

34
00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:40.605
But it is officially Christmas season now

35
00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:41.885
that we are past Thanksgiving.

36
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:43.525
I don't know if that's your philosophy or not,

37
00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:46.005
but uh, here we are officially now.

38
00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:49.165
And so we wanted to take these next few weeks just to walk

39
00:01:49.165 --> 00:01:53.845
through the actual story of what happened 2000 years ago.

40
00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:59.125
A lot of people are familiar with generalized ish kind

41
00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.845
of ways that they feel like they know the Christmas story,

42
00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:04.325
but this will actually, Luke one

43
00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:06.565
and two will clarify it for us.

44
00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:10.365
Not only that, it all beautifully relates back to

45
00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:12.005
what we just finished walking

46
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:13.965
through in First and second Samuel.

47
00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:17.645
It ties together that we were looking back then

48
00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:19.285
for the promised King.

49
00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:23.045
Well, here he actually shows up.

50
00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:26.685
So from promise to presence,

51
00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:31.685
his is the throne of his father David.

52
00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:36.125
What that means for us today then is this,

53
00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:38.565
if you remember nothing else, you can remember this today,

54
00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:43.605
is that God keeps his promises even

55
00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:47.245
through unexpected means and unworthy people.

56
00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:52.005
God keeps his promises. That's what we're gonna learn today.

57
00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:56.525
God keeps his promises even through unexpected means

58
00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:59.165
and unworthy people.

59
00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:04.825
We saw glimpses of that truth throughout one and two Samuel.

60
00:03:05.865 --> 00:03:08.345
I mean, God used supernatural events

61
00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:10.625
and sinful people

62
00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:14.265
to accomplish his purposes in Israel back then.

63
00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:16.785
So we've seen glimpses of it,

64
00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:20.465
but now we will see it in living color right here

65
00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:22.745
in Luke one and two.

66
00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:26.465
And here's why this is so important for us today.

67
00:03:28.705 --> 00:03:31.115
This is not just to help us have a little more

68
00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.915
sweet Christmas season, like this is not

69
00:03:33.915 --> 00:03:35.235
for cinnamon mentality.

70
00:03:37.545 --> 00:03:40.755
What we're talking about here is the reality.

71
00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:46.755
Knowing some of you may be in the fog of doubt right now

72
00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:50.805
or, or you see events in your life

73
00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:52.685
and you're thinking, man, there's no way

74
00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:55.005
that God could be good.

75
00:03:57.035 --> 00:03:58.315
I, I look at this situation

76
00:03:58.335 --> 00:04:00.235
and I'm just thinking like, man,

77
00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:01.835
does he really have a plan here?

78
00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:03.995
It doesn't seem like it. It sure seems like all I'm getting

79
00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:05.155
is just pounded left and right.

80
00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:07.475
No, this, this can't be good.

81
00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:12.725
And so with that as the background,

82
00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:16.805
that's why we look at this a little more afresh today,

83
00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:20.575
that God keeps his promises even

84
00:04:20.575 --> 00:04:24.395
through unexpected means and unworthy people.

85
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:28.355
So let's pray towards that end together now, Lord,

86
00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:32.835
we do ask you to use your word today to speak to

87
00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:37.245
that person who's questioning

88
00:04:37.595 --> 00:04:39.885
whether this stuff is really legit or not.

89
00:04:41.745 --> 00:04:44.045
You would speak to that person who's looking at their

90
00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:46.805
situation in life and just thinking, there's no way out.

91
00:04:46.805 --> 00:04:51.485
There's hopeless situations all around me. Can God be good?

92
00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:54.205
Does God have a plan? Lord, show us today.

93
00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:59.165
Remind us as we walk into the storm later in life,

94
00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:03.235
remind us of these truths today that you keep your promises.

95
00:05:06.735 --> 00:05:08.965
Speak that to our tr, our minds, our hearts,

96
00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:14.355
that we would not lose sight in this Christmas season.

97
00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:16.155
We'd not lose sight of what it's really all about.

98
00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:22.225
You keep your promises, Lord, teach us today in Jesus' name.

99
00:05:22.935 --> 00:05:26.425
Amen. So if you're not already there, go ahead

100
00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:28.305
and turn with me in your copy of God's word

101
00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:31.785
to the gospel according to Luke chapter one.

102
00:05:33.005 --> 00:05:35.505
If you're unfamiliar with the Bible, that's about three

103
00:05:35.505 --> 00:05:36.945
fourths of the way through, uh,

104
00:05:36.945 --> 00:05:38.705
you'll hit the New Testament, we call it.

105
00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:42.265
That's Matthew begins it, then Mark, then Luke,

106
00:05:42.735 --> 00:05:47.215
just chapter one, first words of it, we call it the gospel.

107
00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:51.735
According to Luke, it means the good news of Jesus according

108
00:05:51.835 --> 00:05:53.695
to meaning from his perspective.

109
00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:57.925
But, but this is just the researched historical account

110
00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:02.725
of the good news about Jesus, what he did, who he was,

111
00:06:02.755 --> 00:06:04.525
what he said, all of that.

112
00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:06.205
In fact, that's what he starts

113
00:06:06.205 --> 00:06:09.085
with in the first four verses right here, verses one

114
00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:13.365
through four of chapter one says, in as much

115
00:06:13.385 --> 00:06:16.525
as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things

116
00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:20.085
that have been accomplished among us, just as those

117
00:06:20.085 --> 00:06:21.845
who were from the beginning were eyewitnesses

118
00:06:21.845 --> 00:06:24.485
and ministers of the word have delivered them to us,

119
00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:28.445
it seemed good to me also having followed all things closely

120
00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:31.765
for some time past to write an orderly account

121
00:06:31.765 --> 00:06:33.805
for you most excellent Theophilus,

122
00:06:34.155 --> 00:06:35.925
that you may have certainty

123
00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:38.925
concerning the things you have been taught.

124
00:06:40.865 --> 00:06:44.295
So here's what we know about Luke from historical records.

125
00:06:44.295 --> 00:06:46.175
What we see of Luke is that he was a physician,

126
00:06:47.065 --> 00:06:48.575
which means he was a researcher.

127
00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.455
He wasn't just gonna take it stock value,

128
00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:51.935
he was going to study it.

129
00:06:51.955 --> 00:06:54.815
He was somebody who was not originally part

130
00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.735
of the 12 that followed Jesus.

131
00:06:56.955 --> 00:06:58.935
He was coming to faith a little bit later

132
00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:01.455
as they shared the gospel with him.

133
00:07:02.035 --> 00:07:04.495
And here's what I love about Luke is he would not have been

134
00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:07.295
one to just take it from face value and just believe it.

135
00:07:07.415 --> 00:07:09.775
'cause you said it right? He's going, think about it.

136
00:07:09.775 --> 00:07:11.015
He's going to look into it.

137
00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:13.375
He's not gonna take this faith stuff lightly.

138
00:07:13.675 --> 00:07:18.655
To him then belief was reasonable. He looked into it.

139
00:07:18.755 --> 00:07:20.015
He was was

140
00:07:20.015 --> 00:07:21.895
of course God opened his eyes and heart to see it.

141
00:07:21.895 --> 00:07:23.055
But he looked at all the facts.

142
00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:26.135
He looked at all the history. He asked a bunch of questions.

143
00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:29.595
And even in that in many ways

144
00:07:29.755 --> 00:07:31.875
because of that, he believed

145
00:07:34.685 --> 00:07:38.105
that's what he was doing here for Theophilus, this recipient

146
00:07:38.205 --> 00:07:40.185
of his writings, both Luke and Ax.

147
00:07:40.205 --> 00:07:41.865
We don't know who Theophilus actually was.

148
00:07:42.565 --> 00:07:44.225
It could have been a pseudonym for somebody else

149
00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:45.865
to protect the guy he was writing to,

150
00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:50.465
or most likely it was used as a catchall

151
00:07:51.135 --> 00:07:55.185
name for a group of people that he's writing this

152
00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:57.465
for a generalized audience.

153
00:07:57.605 --> 00:07:58.945
People who imagine this,

154
00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:01.785
who had received some instruction about Jesus.

155
00:08:01.935 --> 00:08:04.865
They were probably believers in Jesus,

156
00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.385
but for some reason they needed to be reassured

157
00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:12.185
of the reliability of the information they'd been receiving.

158
00:08:13.175 --> 00:08:15.585
Like, okay, is this I, I think I believe this,

159
00:08:15.765 --> 00:08:19.345
but ah, I just need some confidence in it.

160
00:08:20.245 --> 00:08:21.305
So that's what he's doing here.

161
00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:24.265
He's giving Theophilus, you're giving this group

162
00:08:24.265 --> 00:08:27.225
of people the truth of the history, the facts

163
00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:30.865
of the history, which was important of course some,

164
00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:34.225
some backing to the events that was important.

165
00:08:34.285 --> 00:08:36.465
But he was not just giving them a factual

166
00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:37.865
rundown of what happened.

167
00:08:39.465 --> 00:08:44.405
He was also speaking of the belief that those facts

168
00:08:45.175 --> 00:08:47.845
would lead to, right?

169
00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:49.925
It wasn't just a set of history, right?

170
00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:53.525
This is not just a history book. It does tell us history.

171
00:08:53.545 --> 00:08:56.125
It is historical, but it's not just that.

172
00:08:56.355 --> 00:09:01.245
It's also leading people to believe in the one it speaks of.

173
00:09:01.505 --> 00:09:03.365
And so these people had believed

174
00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.925
and now they're needing the foundation behind it

175
00:09:06.025 --> 00:09:07.165
and the certainty of it.

176
00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:09.045
And Luke's like, I got you. Here it is.

177
00:09:10.105 --> 00:09:12.485
He provided a solid basis

178
00:09:13.025 --> 00:09:15.205
for their faith in Jesus Christ.

179
00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:20.975
And so for us then we're gonna see a lot of promises

180
00:09:21.685 --> 00:09:24.055
that Luke shows were fulfilled.

181
00:09:25.245 --> 00:09:26.295
What that means is

182
00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:28.615
that when we look at the promises from our perspective,

183
00:09:28.615 --> 00:09:31.135
looking back at all, God has said, all God has done

184
00:09:31.325 --> 00:09:32.735
what we know first

185
00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:36.015
and foremost here is that God's promises stand

186
00:09:36.315 --> 00:09:37.615
as historically certain.

187
00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:40.195
That's guarantee.

188
00:09:40.195 --> 00:09:44.755
What we learn here first is that God's promises stand as

189
00:09:45.315 --> 00:09:46.635
historically certain.

190
00:09:48.095 --> 00:09:50.755
All God has said, all God has promised, all God has done.

191
00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:55.755
It's historically certain the

192
00:09:55.755 --> 00:09:57.915
gospel, we talk about the good news about Jesus.

193
00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:01.475
It's not just a myth, it's not just a legend.

194
00:10:01.665 --> 00:10:03.595
It's not just some story we came up with

195
00:10:03.595 --> 00:10:05.115
to make ourselves feel better.

196
00:10:05.385 --> 00:10:09.875
This is eye witness testimony that is carefully researched

197
00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:13.835
and handed down, right?

198
00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:15.955
You know how it works. You've seen those courtroom shows,

199
00:10:15.955 --> 00:10:17.355
hopefully not been in court too often,

200
00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:18.635
but you've seen the shows, right?

201
00:10:18.635 --> 00:10:21.715
That you, you see the most credible thing

202
00:10:21.865 --> 00:10:25.795
that is presented in a courtroom is eyewitness testimony.

203
00:10:27.065 --> 00:10:29.075
Like, I saw it happen. That's the guy, right?

204
00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:31.555
That's the one. They did it. They were not there.

205
00:10:31.775 --> 00:10:35.115
All of that eyewitness testimony brings the most behind it.

206
00:10:35.585 --> 00:10:38.355
This is eyewitness testimony.

207
00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:41.875
What Luke was researching, recording,

208
00:10:41.905 --> 00:10:43.435
writing down, investigating.

209
00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:46.515
That's why we can stake our eternity on it.

210
00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:49.195
This is not just somebody sitting in a room writing a story.

211
00:10:49.345 --> 00:10:52.115
This is researched eyewitness accounts.

212
00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:56.275
Notice Luke says, I followed all things closely.

213
00:10:57.935 --> 00:10:59.675
He was involved, he was looking into it.

214
00:10:59.695 --> 00:11:02.235
He was writing then an orderly account.

215
00:11:02.465 --> 00:11:05.075
What that means is that God cares about facts.

216
00:11:07.175 --> 00:11:09.915
God cares about and works in history.

217
00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:12.195
This is not a parallel universe

218
00:11:12.195 --> 00:11:14.555
where we're living a life here and there

219
00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:16.795
and we're living out the facts of history

220
00:11:17.015 --> 00:11:19.795
and God's paralleling it over here with some kind of myth.

221
00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:21.435
That's a legend. That's a story.

222
00:11:21.695 --> 00:11:26.635
No, he's working in real history, not just spiritual ideas.

223
00:11:27.275 --> 00:11:28.915
Nebulous, nothingness out there.

224
00:11:29.225 --> 00:11:33.435
This is real entered into our lives kind of history.

225
00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:36.135
That's the story of Christmas.

226
00:11:36.835 --> 00:11:38.215
That's why we can look at this

227
00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:40.495
and say these are historically certain.

228
00:11:40.495 --> 00:11:44.135
That's also why when we talk about Christian hope,

229
00:11:45.545 --> 00:11:49.575
we're not just talking about like a wishful thinking, man,

230
00:11:49.615 --> 00:11:51.175
I really hope my team wins this week.

231
00:11:51.415 --> 00:11:52.735
I really hope this happens.

232
00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:55.525
I really hope I get that for Christmas.

233
00:11:55.525 --> 00:11:56.925
So not just wishful thinking,

234
00:11:57.355 --> 00:12:01.765
this hope we are talking about Christian hope is anchored in

235
00:12:01.785 --> 00:12:04.485
the bedrock of historical reality.

236
00:12:06.215 --> 00:12:09.995
We have hope for the future because something happened,

237
00:12:10.985 --> 00:12:12.955
because God exists.

238
00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:15.315
We know we have hope for the future

239
00:12:15.315 --> 00:12:16.675
because of that historical

240
00:12:17.105 --> 00:12:18.105
Reality.

241
00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:22.115
And that's the trend in our day.

242
00:12:23.595 --> 00:12:26.015
So much of our world floats through life

243
00:12:26.205 --> 00:12:29.735
with this vague sense of something spiritual happening.

244
00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:33.935
Even Christians can trend towards that.

245
00:12:33.935 --> 00:12:36.735
That it's all about this spirituality and spiritualism

246
00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:38.375
and you're just kind of feelings based.

247
00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:40.535
And everything's about this idea.

248
00:12:42.765 --> 00:12:47.225
No dig into the certainty of what God has done.

249
00:12:49.175 --> 00:12:50.475
The certainty of it.

250
00:12:50.705 --> 00:12:53.715
It's good that in an age of relativism

251
00:12:53.975 --> 00:12:57.275
and fake news, God says,

252
00:12:57.875 --> 00:12:59.195
I have entered into history.

253
00:12:59.595 --> 00:13:02.635
I have acted, tested, evaluated.

254
00:13:02.895 --> 00:13:05.555
You can rest your soul on this.

255
00:13:07.155 --> 00:13:10.525
It's Good news for us that something certain

256
00:13:11.645 --> 00:13:12.645
Exists.

257
00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:16.145
God keeps his promises

258
00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:21.175
and those promises stand as historically certain.

259
00:13:24.255 --> 00:13:25.355
And he does that even through

260
00:13:25.355 --> 00:13:26.755
unexpected means and unworthy people.

261
00:13:27.895 --> 00:13:29.675
So watch what Luke recorded first.

262
00:13:30.345 --> 00:13:32.195
He's researched, he's writing this account.

263
00:13:32.455 --> 00:13:33.555
Here's what he starts with.

264
00:13:33.555 --> 00:13:37.995
Verse five, in the days of Herod king

265
00:13:37.995 --> 00:13:40.355
of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharia

266
00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:41.955
of the division of Ajam.

267
00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:44.155
He had a wife from the daughters of Aaron

268
00:13:44.175 --> 00:13:45.875
and her name was Elizabeth.

269
00:13:46.895 --> 00:13:48.235
And they were both righteous

270
00:13:48.575 --> 00:13:51.675
before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments

271
00:13:51.675 --> 00:13:52.755
and statutes of the Lord.

272
00:13:53.815 --> 00:13:57.115
But they had no child because Elizabeth was barren

273
00:13:57.495 --> 00:13:59.355
and both were advanced in years.

274
00:14:01.745 --> 00:14:06.205
And so it's interesting that the first thing Luke chooses

275
00:14:06.205 --> 00:14:10.285
to record has nothing to do with the person

276
00:14:10.395 --> 00:14:12.365
that eventually we talk about all the time.

277
00:14:13.265 --> 00:14:14.805
He starts with Zechariah and Elizabeth.

278
00:14:14.805 --> 00:14:16.325
It doesn't start with Mary, it doesn't start with anybody.

279
00:14:16.325 --> 00:14:20.485
Jesus. He starts with Zechariah, this godly man

280
00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:21.925
who was a priest in Israel at the time,

281
00:14:21.925 --> 00:14:23.965
and it tells us a little bit about his wife, Elizabeth.

282
00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:26.245
Her situation, their situation

283
00:14:26.545 --> 00:14:28.085
and the details are important.

284
00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:32.085
I say this every time, we can't skip over the details

285
00:14:32.425 --> 00:14:33.445
of the Bible

286
00:14:33.445 --> 00:14:36.885
because verse six says, they were both righteous

287
00:14:36.885 --> 00:14:39.925
before God walking blamelessly in all God's commandments.

288
00:14:40.345 --> 00:14:44.165
But that did not mean their life was perfect as

289
00:14:44.205 --> 00:14:45.205
A result.

290
00:14:47.415 --> 00:14:50.955
Verse seven. But they had no child

291
00:14:51.995 --> 00:14:53.685
because Elizabeth was barren

292
00:14:54.345 --> 00:14:55.765
and both were advanced in years.

293
00:14:57.945 --> 00:14:59.925
Here's what that means contextually back then.

294
00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:05.865
That means probably for decades, Elizabeth walked around

295
00:15:08.895 --> 00:15:13.025
considered less than some shame,

296
00:15:13.645 --> 00:15:18.195
heaped on her as she watched sisters,

297
00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:22.475
cousins, nieces get pregnant, have babies,

298
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:27.985
and she's decades after decades barren.

299
00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:32.205
It was considered a curse in some ways.

300
00:15:37.285 --> 00:15:39.945
And I'm sure if you try to put yourself in her shoes,

301
00:15:41.695 --> 00:15:43.825
that would've tempted her to doubt God, wouldn't it?

302
00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:50.055
God, does God really have a good plan in store for our life?

303
00:15:50.335 --> 00:15:52.495
I mean, this is the thing we are praying for.

304
00:15:52.555 --> 00:15:54.535
We want we long for. It's a good desire.

305
00:15:54.535 --> 00:15:55.855
It's not sinful, it's not an idol.

306
00:15:55.955 --> 00:16:00.265
We want a baby, but God, you're not answering that.

307
00:16:02.255 --> 00:16:06.875
Why are you really good? Do you really have a good plan?

308
00:16:09.745 --> 00:16:11.765
But I don't. I want you to feel that part of it,

309
00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:17.245
but don't miss what it says here about them.

310
00:16:18.585 --> 00:16:21.955
That was true. You can feel the weight of that.

311
00:16:23.335 --> 00:16:27.395
But don't miss that. They both still remained faithful.

312
00:16:29.145 --> 00:16:30.195
They walked righteously.

313
00:16:30.195 --> 00:16:32.395
They were blameless, they were hurting,

314
00:16:32.905 --> 00:16:36.315
they were feeling less than there was this sense of man,

315
00:16:36.315 --> 00:16:37.955
where is God in this situation?

316
00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:42.635
Yet they both still remained faithful the entire time

317
00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:47.815
and watch what happened next.

318
00:16:49.255 --> 00:16:53.735
Starting in verse eight. Now, while he was serving as priest

319
00:16:53.735 --> 00:16:56.415
before God, when his division was on duty, according

320
00:16:56.415 --> 00:16:58.975
to the custom the priesthood, he was chosen by lot

321
00:16:59.275 --> 00:17:01.375
to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.

322
00:17:01.955 --> 00:17:03.495
The whole multitude of the people were praying

323
00:17:03.495 --> 00:17:04.895
outside at the hour of incense

324
00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:07.135
and there appeared to him an angel

325
00:17:07.155 --> 00:17:08.575
of the Lord standing on the right side

326
00:17:08.575 --> 00:17:09.775
of the altar of incense.

327
00:17:10.675 --> 00:17:12.495
And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him

328
00:17:12.495 --> 00:17:13.895
and fear fell upon him.

329
00:17:14.475 --> 00:17:16.615
But the angel said to him, do not be afraid.

330
00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:20.175
Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard.

331
00:17:22.005 --> 00:17:24.025
And your wife, Elizabeth will bear you a son.

332
00:17:24.805 --> 00:17:25.985
You should call his name John.

333
00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:28.305
You'll have joy and gladness

334
00:17:28.305 --> 00:17:30.745
and many will rejoice at his birth for he will be great

335
00:17:30.745 --> 00:17:34.645
before the Lord and he must not drink wine or strong drink

336
00:17:34.985 --> 00:17:36.525
and he'll be filled with the Holy Spirit,

337
00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:37.805
even from his mother's womb

338
00:17:38.585 --> 00:17:40.405
and he will turn many of the children of Israel

339
00:17:40.405 --> 00:17:41.405
to the Lord their God.

340
00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:43.525
He will go before him in the spirit

341
00:17:43.525 --> 00:17:46.365
and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers

342
00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:48.245
to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom

343
00:17:48.265 --> 00:17:51.725
of the just to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.

344
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:57.975
Now, you can't question the sovereignty

345
00:17:57.975 --> 00:17:59.055
of God in this situation

346
00:17:59.525 --> 00:18:00.895
because the way they would do it,

347
00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:02.215
all these priests would stand out there

348
00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:04.055
and it was by lot almost like dice.

349
00:18:04.055 --> 00:18:05.615
They would throw these and say, all right,

350
00:18:05.615 --> 00:18:06.975
you're up because of this.

351
00:18:07.595 --> 00:18:11.295
And so as they did that, who happened to get the lot

352
00:18:11.295 --> 00:18:13.215
that time Zechariah

353
00:18:13.365 --> 00:18:15.855
because God wanted him in the temple at this moment

354
00:18:16.075 --> 00:18:17.335
for this purpose.

355
00:18:19.835 --> 00:18:22.375
And so God sovereignly puts Zechariah in the temple.

356
00:18:22.565 --> 00:18:24.055
He's fulfilling his priestly duties.

357
00:18:24.595 --> 00:18:27.575
God then sends this angel we discover later is Gabriel

358
00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:30.095
who shows up a couple times in these two chapters.

359
00:18:30.315 --> 00:18:32.695
He shows up. Gabriel says to Zechariah,

360
00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:34.775
verse 13, what does he say?

361
00:18:35.725 --> 00:18:38.015
Your prayer has been heard

362
00:18:41.005 --> 00:18:42.945
the prayer that Zechariah

363
00:18:42.945 --> 00:18:45.345
and Elizabeth had been praying potentially for decades.

364
00:18:46.905 --> 00:18:49.115
Gabriel says, your prayer's been heard.

365
00:18:51.405 --> 00:18:55.775
Just as a side note, it's not wrong to pray for something

366
00:18:56.085 --> 00:18:58.615
that God places on your heart as a desire from him.

367
00:19:00.745 --> 00:19:02.845
You wanna be married. It's not an

368
00:19:02.845 --> 00:19:03.885
idol, but you want to be married.

369
00:19:03.905 --> 00:19:05.085
You long for that. Pray for it.

370
00:19:06.315 --> 00:19:10.755
You want a child, pray for it. You want a job, pray for it.

371
00:19:10.755 --> 00:19:13.195
Like those things are not wrong to pray for as long

372
00:19:13.195 --> 00:19:15.595
as they don't become an idol, they're not wrong to pray for.

373
00:19:15.595 --> 00:19:17.075
This is a good desire.

374
00:19:17.455 --> 00:19:21.315
Yet part of trusting God in that is submitting

375
00:19:21.315 --> 00:19:22.355
to God's timing in

376
00:19:22.355 --> 00:19:26.455
that 'cause.

377
00:19:26.455 --> 00:19:28.335
They might have seemed like, man, this is too late.

378
00:19:29.725 --> 00:19:32.495
It's been decades. We're advanced in years. Like what?

379
00:19:32.495 --> 00:19:34.015
What do we do? It's too late, right?

380
00:19:34.275 --> 00:19:37.655
But in God's perfect plan, now is the time.

381
00:19:39.375 --> 00:19:42.555
Not five years ago, not 40 years ago. Now is the time.

382
00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:45.155
This is the moment. This is when God had ordained

383
00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:48.715
that this is going to be the specific child they get.

384
00:19:48.935 --> 00:19:49.995
His name was gonna be John.

385
00:19:54.475 --> 00:19:55.905
Don't don't doubt.

386
00:19:56.535 --> 00:19:58.545
Even if it takes longer than you think it should.

387
00:20:00.735 --> 00:20:04.795
Now Gabriel interestingly describes the child to Zacharia

388
00:20:06.135 --> 00:20:09.715
And as he describes this baby what he's going to be,

389
00:20:10.215 --> 00:20:15.035
it all points to John being a prophet about the strong drink

390
00:20:15.055 --> 00:20:16.635
and what he's gonna be and what he's gonna do.

391
00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:19.235
All that's pointing to John being a prophet, which is great,

392
00:20:19.235 --> 00:20:20.435
but it's not just any prophet.

393
00:20:21.545 --> 00:20:23.915
It's a prophet. He says that would be like Elijah,

394
00:20:24.215 --> 00:20:27.355
widely considered the greatest prophet in Israel's history.

395
00:20:28.665 --> 00:20:29.835
Like this baby, you're gonna get

396
00:20:29.835 --> 00:20:30.915
zacharia, not just any old baby.

397
00:20:30.915 --> 00:20:33.875
This is gonna be the one like the the greatest one,

398
00:20:33.875 --> 00:20:37.195
the Elijah like figure coming to Israel.

399
00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:41.635
And again, details matter 'cause look again verses 16

400
00:20:41.635 --> 00:20:45.325
and 17, Gabriel says,

401
00:20:45.385 --> 00:20:47.165
and he will turn many of the children

402
00:20:47.185 --> 00:20:48.605
of Israel to the Lord their God.

403
00:20:49.145 --> 00:20:50.405
He will go before him.

404
00:20:50.465 --> 00:20:52.485
We don't know who him is yet in the spirit

405
00:20:52.545 --> 00:20:56.605
and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers

406
00:20:56.605 --> 00:20:58.925
to the children, the disobedient to the wisdom of the just

407
00:20:59.145 --> 00:21:01.405
to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.

408
00:21:03.725 --> 00:21:05.985
Now I want you to listen with that in mind

409
00:21:06.205 --> 00:21:09.025
to the very last words of the Old Testament.

410
00:21:10.545 --> 00:21:13.435
Malachi chapter four, the very last thing God said

411
00:21:13.455 --> 00:21:15.475
before, 400 years of silence

412
00:21:15.845 --> 00:21:17.995
until this moment when Gabriel shows up,

413
00:21:18.255 --> 00:21:21.075
that's the the breaking of 400 years of silence.

414
00:21:21.535 --> 00:21:25.155
The very last thing God said back in Malachi four,

415
00:21:25.655 --> 00:21:29.835
behold I will send you Elijah, the prophet before the great

416
00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:31.675
and awesome day of the Lord comes

417
00:21:32.895 --> 00:21:35.075
and he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children

418
00:21:35.535 --> 00:21:37.275
and the hearts of children to their fathers.

419
00:21:38.075 --> 00:21:39.235
Lest I come and strike the land

420
00:21:39.235 --> 00:21:40.715
with a decree of utter destruction.

421
00:21:44.315 --> 00:21:48.255
See that right? This, this is who this baby's gonna be.

422
00:21:50.105 --> 00:21:53.345
Zechariah hears from Gabriel that that his son John is going

423
00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:57.425
to be that Elijah figure that Malachi four said

424
00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:58.825
and then 400 years of silent.

425
00:21:58.825 --> 00:22:01.985
This is the promise fulfilled from 400 years ago.

426
00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:08.065
He's going to be the one to prepare the way for the Messiah.

427
00:22:08.125 --> 00:22:11.785
That's where he said he will go before him. Who's him?

428
00:22:12.005 --> 00:22:15.825
The Messiah Before God shows up,

429
00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:18.865
this baby, John's gonna grow up

430
00:22:18.865 --> 00:22:23.065
and prepare the way for that king to come.

431
00:22:26.455 --> 00:22:27.515
Now, I dunno about you,

432
00:22:28.655 --> 00:22:32.995
but if an angel showed up in my room, I would tend

433
00:22:32.995 --> 00:22:34.575
to believe him, right?

434
00:22:34.655 --> 00:22:35.975
I don't know, maybe I'm just, I'd be

435
00:22:35.975 --> 00:22:37.495
so terrified I'd be on my face.

436
00:22:37.535 --> 00:22:39.055
I couldn't, couldn't speak Richard.

437
00:22:39.195 --> 00:22:41.175
By the way, every time an angel shows up

438
00:22:41.295 --> 00:22:43.055
to anybody in the Bible, the first thing they have

439
00:22:43.055 --> 00:22:44.255
to say is like, don't be afraid.

440
00:22:44.445 --> 00:22:46.055
Like 'cause you're terrified.

441
00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:49.375
This shining man just comes, shows up in your room like,

442
00:22:49.375 --> 00:22:50.495
yeah, that'd be terrifying.

443
00:22:51.385 --> 00:22:56.025
Don't be afraid. Well watch how Zechariah responded

444
00:22:56.025 --> 00:22:58.345
to this verse 18.

445
00:23:00.975 --> 00:23:04.315
And Zacharia said to the angel, how shall I know this

446
00:23:04.775 --> 00:23:08.435
for I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.

447
00:23:08.615 --> 00:23:09.995
I'm glad he didn't call her old.

448
00:23:10.095 --> 00:23:11.315
He just said advanced in years.

449
00:23:11.335 --> 00:23:13.035
So you can use that one later if you want to.

450
00:23:13.455 --> 00:23:17.275
But he just said she's advanced in years. I'm old.

451
00:23:18.515 --> 00:23:21.895
My wife's advanced years. How is this going to be possible?

452
00:23:21.955 --> 00:23:23.935
He looked at his situation.

453
00:23:25.035 --> 00:23:26.855
He had heard all the angel what it said.

454
00:23:27.275 --> 00:23:29.335
He looked at the the facts of the situation.

455
00:23:29.335 --> 00:23:31.935
He's like, man, there's no way this,

456
00:23:31.935 --> 00:23:34.135
this is biologically impossible.

457
00:23:34.135 --> 00:23:36.375
Look, we've already tried for decades. This is not working.

458
00:23:36.445 --> 00:23:39.375
This is not possible. I'm old, she's advanced in you.

459
00:23:39.445 --> 00:23:41.255
This is not going to work.

460
00:23:42.155 --> 00:23:44.775
But listen, let's give him a little bit of grace here.

461
00:23:45.045 --> 00:23:48.895
'cause don't we all do that? To an extent, isn't

462
00:23:48.895 --> 00:23:50.815
that the human condition that we sit here

463
00:23:50.835 --> 00:23:52.895
and we look at an a seemingly impossible

464
00:23:53.255 --> 00:23:54.335
situation and we think there's no way.

465
00:23:55.965 --> 00:23:59.065
You look at a dead marriage, you look at a prodigal child,

466
00:23:59.885 --> 00:24:01.545
you look at the debt that's looming over you

467
00:24:01.545 --> 00:24:03.145
and you just think there's no way out.

468
00:24:05.215 --> 00:24:07.225
This is an impossible situation.

469
00:24:07.285 --> 00:24:10.105
So yeah, Zechariah was looking at his situation

470
00:24:10.105 --> 00:24:11.185
thinking, this is impossible.

471
00:24:11.565 --> 00:24:13.785
We do the same thing.

472
00:24:14.925 --> 00:24:16.985
But aren't you thankful that we serve a God

473
00:24:17.005 --> 00:24:18.985
who specializes in resurrection?

474
00:24:21.915 --> 00:24:24.935
And we're gonna watch a little bit later in chapter one,

475
00:24:25.595 --> 00:24:28.015
how God fulfills this promise to Zechariah.

476
00:24:28.845 --> 00:24:30.535
Like it comes to pass, it happens.

477
00:24:30.675 --> 00:24:34.885
But I want you to see like we kind of sat in the feeling

478
00:24:34.945 --> 00:24:37.605
of Elizabeth, that she's doubting and questioning.

479
00:24:37.955 --> 00:24:39.725
This is Zechariah's turn.

480
00:24:40.585 --> 00:24:42.685
And he's doubting, he's questioning what is going on.

481
00:24:42.725 --> 00:24:45.045
I don't understand how this could be possible. Watch how God

482
00:24:45.325 --> 00:24:50.185
Responds To Zechariah here starting verse 19.

483
00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:54.045
And the angel answered him, I am Gabriel.

484
00:24:54.565 --> 00:24:56.325
I stand in the presence of God

485
00:24:56.585 --> 00:24:58.125
and I was sent to speak to you

486
00:24:58.225 --> 00:24:59.485
and to bring you this good news.

487
00:24:59.995 --> 00:25:02.365
Meaning like, Hey, don't take it up with me.

488
00:25:02.365 --> 00:25:04.685
Take it up with the Father. Like he's the one who sent me.

489
00:25:04.875 --> 00:25:06.045
He's got this under control.

490
00:25:09.755 --> 00:25:12.015
And behold, you'll be silent

491
00:25:12.835 --> 00:25:14.535
and unable to speak until the day

492
00:25:14.535 --> 00:25:17.295
that these things take place because you did not believe

493
00:25:17.295 --> 00:25:20.095
My words, Which will be fulfilled in their time.

494
00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:22.925
And the people were waiting for zacharia.

495
00:25:22.925 --> 00:25:24.685
And they were wondering at his delay in the temple.

496
00:25:24.705 --> 00:25:26.605
And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them.

497
00:25:27.105 --> 00:25:28.805
And they realized he'd seen a vision in the temple

498
00:25:28.805 --> 00:25:31.085
and he kept making signs to them and remained mute.

499
00:25:31.665 --> 00:25:34.005
And when his time of service ended, he went to his home.

500
00:25:35.755 --> 00:25:39.145
Verse 24, after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived.

501
00:25:40.655 --> 00:25:43.235
And for five months she kept herself hidden, saying,

502
00:25:43.235 --> 00:25:45.675
thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on

503
00:25:45.675 --> 00:25:50.115
me to take away my reproach, that shame among people.

504
00:25:53.155 --> 00:25:54.735
Here's what I want you to see with this

505
00:25:57.775 --> 00:26:02.135
zechariah's unbelief could not stop God's plan.

506
00:26:04.025 --> 00:26:07.015
God did it. He,

507
00:26:07.195 --> 00:26:09.295
he saw this happen in his wife.

508
00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:12.815
He saw this happen in their lives. Zechariah's.

509
00:26:12.815 --> 00:26:15.855
Unbelief could not stop God's plan,

510
00:26:16.315 --> 00:26:20.615
but hear me, it can silence our praise.

511
00:26:23.835 --> 00:26:27.715
'cause you were designed, created by God to worship,

512
00:26:28.255 --> 00:26:31.275
to praise him that your life would reflect the glory

513
00:26:31.275 --> 00:26:32.275
and goodness of God.

514
00:26:32.295 --> 00:26:34.475
That's what you are created and designed to do.

515
00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:35.875
That's what you're supposed to do.

516
00:26:36.095 --> 00:26:39.915
But if we doubt that God can truly bring light out of dark

517
00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:44.045
life, out of death hope, out of uncertainty, if we doubt

518
00:26:44.045 --> 00:26:46.805
that, then the praise we were designed to give

519
00:26:47.435 --> 00:26:48.925
will be quenched.

520
00:26:51.285 --> 00:26:56.075
He was made mute because he didn't believe.

521
00:26:59.075 --> 00:27:00.415
So here's what I want us to learn from this.

522
00:27:00.415 --> 00:27:02.295
Here's, I believe God gave this to us

523
00:27:02.515 --> 00:27:03.515
To today.

524
00:27:05.775 --> 00:27:06.975
'cause I know a lot of situations.

525
00:27:06.975 --> 00:27:08.535
I know people are going through a lot as we deal

526
00:27:08.535 --> 00:27:10.535
with God's promises and think about who God is.

527
00:27:10.835 --> 00:27:12.015
Here's here's the point.

528
00:27:13.345 --> 00:27:17.135
God's promises overcome human impossibility

529
00:27:17.225 --> 00:27:18.225
Every time.

530
00:27:20.775 --> 00:27:23.765
God's promises will always overcome

531
00:27:24.375 --> 00:27:26.005
human impossibility.

532
00:27:28.035 --> 00:27:30.135
We look at our situation, we look at our lives,

533
00:27:30.195 --> 00:27:32.375
we look at this whole thing around us

534
00:27:33.995 --> 00:27:35.975
and we think this thing is impossible.

535
00:27:36.085 --> 00:27:39.615
There's no way out. We see an insurmountable hurdle.

536
00:27:40.235 --> 00:27:43.175
But we forget God can do whatever he wants.

537
00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:50.565
And what God promises he accomplishes.

538
00:27:51.695 --> 00:27:53.595
If he's promised it, he performs it.

539
00:27:54.425 --> 00:27:56.635
Even when biology or age

540
00:27:56.735 --> 00:28:00.235
or barrenness, it all screams impossible to zacharia.

541
00:28:00.455 --> 00:28:03.435
But the Lord can create something out of nothing.

542
00:28:05.195 --> 00:28:06.505
Don't you remember Genesis one,

543
00:28:06.565 --> 00:28:08.945
the very first page in the beginning there was nothing

544
00:28:09.965 --> 00:28:11.945
and God spoke and there was something.

545
00:28:13.575 --> 00:28:14.675
That's what God does.

546
00:28:14.895 --> 00:28:18.195
He by definition can bring something out of nothing.

547
00:28:18.535 --> 00:28:20.875
He can do that in Zacharia and Elizabeth

548
00:28:20.895 --> 00:28:22.915
and he can do that in your life

549
00:28:23.295 --> 00:28:24.295
Too.

550
00:28:27.295 --> 00:28:28.915
And he doesn't need your Strength.

551
00:28:31.395 --> 00:28:34.105
Again, spoke and something out of nothing.

552
00:28:34.325 --> 00:28:36.545
He doesn't need your tools. He doesn't need your strength.

553
00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:38.265
Like, man, I can't work through them. They're too weak.

554
00:28:38.445 --> 00:28:40.185
No, he doesn't need your strength.

555
00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:41.425
What he needs is your faith.

556
00:28:43.295 --> 00:28:44.555
He needs zacharia to look at him

557
00:28:44.555 --> 00:28:45.755
and say, okay, God, you got this.

558
00:28:46.055 --> 00:28:49.785
I'm in. He needs you to say, I don't understand this.

559
00:28:49.785 --> 00:28:51.225
It doesn't look like anything. He's gonna come

560
00:28:51.225 --> 00:28:52.505
of this, but God, I believe you.

561
00:28:52.615 --> 00:28:54.305
This is your promise. I'm standing on it.

562
00:28:54.605 --> 00:28:56.345
That's what he needs. He needs your faith.

563
00:28:56.965 --> 00:28:58.065
He brought about the Savior,

564
00:28:58.125 --> 00:29:01.345
the world in unexpected ways here in Luke one and two.

565
00:29:01.485 --> 00:29:05.975
He can do whatever he wants in your life too. Trust him.

566
00:29:07.525 --> 00:29:10.255
Just trust him. It may not turn out

567
00:29:10.255 --> 00:29:11.375
like you thought it would.

568
00:29:11.515 --> 00:29:12.295
It may be decades

569
00:29:12.465 --> 00:29:13.775
later than you thought it was gonna happen.

570
00:29:13.995 --> 00:29:16.135
But he will accomplish what he

571
00:29:16.455 --> 00:29:17.455
Promised.

572
00:29:21.065 --> 00:29:22.065
Trust him.

573
00:29:25.735 --> 00:29:28.265
Well, here's what I love about how Luke

574
00:29:28.365 --> 00:29:29.365
Set this up.

575
00:29:31.025 --> 00:29:32.825
'cause that was hard. I mean, Zacharia question,

576
00:29:32.825 --> 00:29:34.465
he's going with mute for a while like that.

577
00:29:34.575 --> 00:29:38.865
Okay? As that was going on with Zacharia and Elizabeth

578
00:29:38.865 --> 00:29:40.105
and their life and the promise

579
00:29:40.165 --> 00:29:41.460
and all that stuff happening happening,

580
00:29:41.955 --> 00:29:43.925
Gabriel wasn't done working yet.

581
00:29:45.555 --> 00:29:49.895
He continued his assignment. Next, look at verse 26 to 33.

582
00:29:54.165 --> 00:29:56.545
In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God

583
00:29:56.545 --> 00:30:00.465
to a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin Betroth,

584
00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:03.025
to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David.

585
00:30:04.085 --> 00:30:05.305
The Virgin's name was Mary.

586
00:30:06.165 --> 00:30:08.625
And he came to her and said, greetings, oh favored one.

587
00:30:08.725 --> 00:30:12.285
The Lord is with you. But she was greatly troubled at the

588
00:30:12.285 --> 00:30:13.565
saying, trying to discern

589
00:30:13.635 --> 00:30:15.085
what sort of greeting this might be.

590
00:30:16.105 --> 00:30:18.405
And the angel said to her, do not be afraid, Mary,

591
00:30:19.065 --> 00:30:20.925
for you have found favor with God.

592
00:30:22.345 --> 00:30:24.805
Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son

593
00:30:24.985 --> 00:30:26.885
and you shall call his name Jesus.

594
00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:30.775
He'll be great and he'll be called the son of the most high.

595
00:30:31.355 --> 00:30:32.615
And the Lord God will give

596
00:30:32.615 --> 00:30:34.095
to him the throne of his father David.

597
00:30:34.515 --> 00:30:35.615
And he will reign over the house

598
00:30:35.615 --> 00:30:38.455
of Jacob forever and of his kingdom.

599
00:30:38.665 --> 00:30:40.655
There will be no end.

600
00:30:42.595 --> 00:30:43.815
And so here's the difference.

601
00:30:45.045 --> 00:30:46.415
That promise to Zachary

602
00:30:46.415 --> 00:30:47.695
and Elizabeth was an awesome promise.

603
00:30:47.935 --> 00:30:50.735
I mean barren for decades. Finally, get a baby.

604
00:30:50.805 --> 00:30:52.535
He's gonna be a cool dude. Like this is gonna be awesome.

605
00:30:52.725 --> 00:30:57.055
It's great. But that pales in comparison to the promise

606
00:30:57.405 --> 00:30:59.095
that is even greater right here.

607
00:30:59.435 --> 00:31:03.615
The incarnation of the son of the most high, the son of God,

608
00:31:03.675 --> 00:31:06.455
the second person of the Trinity taking on flesh

609
00:31:06.755 --> 00:31:08.215
and dwelling among us.

610
00:31:08.445 --> 00:31:10.375
That is overwhelmingly stunning.

611
00:31:12.945 --> 00:31:14.885
And here's the cool part. If you've been with us

612
00:31:14.885 --> 00:31:18.165
for the last few months, those last two verses I read

613
00:31:19.145 --> 00:31:21.085
should sound familiar

614
00:31:22.865 --> 00:31:27.475
because this is exactly the covenant that God made

615
00:31:27.475 --> 00:31:30.155
with David all the way back in two Samuel seven.

616
00:31:31.535 --> 00:31:32.815
I wanna read it to you. Listen to this.

617
00:31:32.845 --> 00:31:37.055
This is what God said to David, said, David,

618
00:31:37.155 --> 00:31:38.335
here's my covenant with you.

619
00:31:38.335 --> 00:31:40.095
This is what I promise to you, David.

620
00:31:40.525 --> 00:31:42.015
When your days are fulfilled

621
00:31:42.115 --> 00:31:43.615
and you lie down with your fathers,

622
00:31:43.855 --> 00:31:45.455
I will raise up your offspring

623
00:31:45.455 --> 00:31:47.495
after you who shall come from your body.

624
00:31:47.715 --> 00:31:49.455
And I will establish his kingdom.

625
00:31:50.435 --> 00:31:52.535
He shall build a house for my name.

626
00:31:52.935 --> 00:31:55.615
I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.

627
00:31:57.495 --> 00:31:58.535
I will be to him a father,

628
00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:03.735
and he shall be to me a son, the son of the most high.

629
00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:04.895
See what's happening here,

630
00:32:06.975 --> 00:32:11.665
this is a thousand years later when God said that to David,

631
00:32:11.725 --> 00:32:14.145
he said, you're gonna have his son on the throne

632
00:32:14.405 --> 00:32:15.665
who will be my son forever.

633
00:32:16.045 --> 00:32:17.425
And you're gonna have this house

634
00:32:17.605 --> 00:32:19.785
and you're gonna have this child on the

635
00:32:19.785 --> 00:32:21.465
kingdom throne forever.

636
00:32:21.985 --> 00:32:23.625
A thousand years later, we see

637
00:32:23.885 --> 00:32:26.025
to marry this is who your son's gonna be.

638
00:32:31.125 --> 00:32:33.625
The promise became presence.

639
00:32:36.235 --> 00:32:38.615
And again, that promise to secondmental Elizabeth was great.

640
00:32:38.675 --> 00:32:41.485
It was awesome. But this promise right here is

641
00:32:41.485 --> 00:32:42.685
what it's all really about.

642
00:32:44.025 --> 00:32:46.365
All those promises, even the promise about John,

643
00:32:46.365 --> 00:32:49.765
even the promises from Genesis three through Malachi four,

644
00:32:49.955 --> 00:32:54.125
they all center on this miraculous Messiah.

645
00:32:55.655 --> 00:32:58.005
Everything, all the promises of God,

646
00:32:58.335 --> 00:32:59.685
everything in the Old Testament,

647
00:32:59.685 --> 00:33:02.485
everything in the New Testament, it all centers on this one,

648
00:33:02.835 --> 00:33:06.885
this promise of the miraculous Messiah to come, the son

649
00:33:06.905 --> 00:33:11.005
of the most high becoming like you and me to save us.

650
00:33:11.105 --> 00:33:13.405
That's what it all revolves around

651
00:33:14.855 --> 00:33:16.325
everything in the Old Testament.

652
00:33:16.325 --> 00:33:18.405
Genesis three, Malachi four, the promise

653
00:33:18.545 --> 00:33:22.085
of redemption was centered on a savior, this messiah

654
00:33:22.145 --> 00:33:24.085
to come, a kinsman redeemer.

655
00:33:24.185 --> 00:33:26.965
One who would come from the family in order

656
00:33:26.965 --> 00:33:27.965
to redeem the family.

657
00:33:30.305 --> 00:33:32.485
That's why this next piece of the puzzle is so important.

658
00:33:34.305 --> 00:33:35.935
Again, this is not just sentimentality.

659
00:33:35.935 --> 00:33:37.535
This is really critical.

660
00:33:37.605 --> 00:33:40.415
Look at verses 34 through 38 of Luke one.

661
00:33:42.275 --> 00:33:43.415
And Mary said to the angel,

662
00:33:43.515 --> 00:33:44.975
how will this be since I'm a virgin?

663
00:33:45.715 --> 00:33:47.015
And the angel answered her,

664
00:33:47.015 --> 00:33:48.495
the Holy Spirit will come upon you

665
00:33:48.635 --> 00:33:50.895
and the power of the most high will overshadow you.

666
00:33:51.765 --> 00:33:54.935
Therefore, the child to be born will be called holy.

667
00:33:55.515 --> 00:33:58.255
Set apart the Son of God.

668
00:34:00.085 --> 00:34:01.385
Behold, your relative, Elizabeth,

669
00:34:01.385 --> 00:34:03.265
in her old age has also conceived a son.

670
00:34:03.455 --> 00:34:06.785
This is the sixth month with her who was called barren

671
00:34:07.615 --> 00:34:10.425
because nothing will be impossible with God.

672
00:34:12.365 --> 00:34:14.385
And Mary said, behold, I'm the servant of the Lord.

673
00:34:14.925 --> 00:34:17.225
Let it be to me according to your word.

674
00:34:17.605 --> 00:34:18.985
And the angel departed from her.

675
00:34:21.475 --> 00:34:23.815
See, here's the reality, the fact

676
00:34:23.815 --> 00:34:25.135
that Jesus was born of a virgin.

677
00:34:25.245 --> 00:34:26.615
It's not just some party trick.

678
00:34:26.615 --> 00:34:27.655
It's not just a cool miracle.

679
00:34:28.075 --> 00:34:31.335
It actually has to do with why and how we are saved.

680
00:34:32.965 --> 00:34:34.015
This is a big deal

681
00:34:34.805 --> 00:34:38.335
because if the Son of God came only as God,

682
00:34:38.965 --> 00:34:41.055
then he wouldn't be able to relate to us

683
00:34:41.355 --> 00:34:44.615
and then wouldn't be able to redeem our bodies and creation.

684
00:34:45.085 --> 00:34:46.615
He'd just be God and we'd be humans.

685
00:34:48.515 --> 00:34:51.415
But the flip side, if he only has a sinful father

686
00:34:51.835 --> 00:34:55.315
and a sinful mother, then he's not able

687
00:34:55.335 --> 00:34:57.075
to be the sufficient sacrifice

688
00:34:57.175 --> 00:34:59.075
to cover the penalty for our sins.

689
00:35:00.025 --> 00:35:04.475
He's just another guy. That's why this is so important.

690
00:35:04.695 --> 00:35:06.275
It has to be both God

691
00:35:06.455 --> 00:35:08.715
and man, which is why he was born of a virgin.

692
00:35:09.575 --> 00:35:12.635
He didn't have the seed of Adam, yours

693
00:35:12.635 --> 00:35:15.875
and mine, that we of the sinful seed flowing through us.

694
00:35:16.175 --> 00:35:19.515
And he also did have the flesh of humanity.

695
00:35:21.265 --> 00:35:23.595
He's both God and man in one.

696
00:35:23.615 --> 00:35:26.075
That's the mind blowing reality of Christmas.

697
00:35:26.535 --> 00:35:27.915
That's why this was such a big deal.

698
00:35:28.465 --> 00:35:31.075
It's not just an old couple conceiving, which is great,

699
00:35:31.335 --> 00:35:34.315
but this was new creation beginning in a

700
00:35:34.315 --> 00:35:35.475
teenage girl's womb.

701
00:35:36.645 --> 00:35:37.965
This is the mixture of God

702
00:35:37.965 --> 00:35:42.045
and man together as one fully God, fully man becoming flesh.

703
00:35:42.385 --> 00:35:46.765
And that is the preview, the preview

704
00:35:47.185 --> 00:35:50.745
of what is to come in the new creation someday God

705
00:35:50.745 --> 00:35:54.915
and man together again, beginning

706
00:35:55.495 --> 00:35:58.595
in a teenage girl's womb 2000 years ago,

707
00:36:02.445 --> 00:36:05.095
it's the fulfillment of another promise.

708
00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:08.615
This one, 700 years earlier,

709
00:36:08.915 --> 00:36:10.615
Isaiah seven 14, read it earlier.

710
00:36:10.645 --> 00:36:13.375
Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign.

711
00:36:13.435 --> 00:36:16.175
Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son

712
00:36:16.315 --> 00:36:19.735
and shall call his name Emmanuel, which means God

713
00:36:19.805 --> 00:36:24.215
with us 700 years.

714
00:36:24.285 --> 00:36:26.695
Promise given. Promise fulfilled.

715
00:36:26.695 --> 00:36:29.015
That's what Luke 1 37 said, nothing,

716
00:36:30.125 --> 00:36:32.015
nothing will be impossible with God.

717
00:36:33.655 --> 00:36:35.265
This barren couple conceives.

718
00:36:35.455 --> 00:36:38.825
It's not impossible, this virgin getting pregnant.

719
00:36:38.855 --> 00:36:41.465
It's not impossible, God taking on flesh.

720
00:36:41.655 --> 00:36:45.985
It's not impossible. Nothing will be impossible with God.

721
00:36:45.985 --> 00:36:47.265
That's why I love Mary's response.

722
00:36:47.335 --> 00:36:48.705
Zacharias was a little questioning,

723
00:36:48.765 --> 00:36:51.345
but Mary's response to Gabriel is faith.

724
00:36:51.345 --> 00:36:52.865
Look at verse 38 again.

725
00:36:53.085 --> 00:36:56.065
She said, behold, I am the servant of the Lord.

726
00:36:56.365 --> 00:36:59.305
Let it be to me according to your word.

727
00:37:01.395 --> 00:37:05.975
I'm in. I'm I'm your servant. I'm yours.

728
00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:09.695
I am all in you. Do what you need to do. God.

729
00:37:12.205 --> 00:37:14.705
See, none of these people deserved to be used by God.

730
00:37:16.445 --> 00:37:18.055
Whether they were old and barren

731
00:37:18.055 --> 00:37:20.695
or whether they were living in this backwoods cast off

732
00:37:20.695 --> 00:37:21.775
town like Nazareth.

733
00:37:22.285 --> 00:37:25.575
They did not deserve to be used by God.

734
00:37:25.795 --> 00:37:29.135
Yet God used their very weakness

735
00:37:30.475 --> 00:37:32.255
to glorify his name.

736
00:37:32.855 --> 00:37:35.095
'cause here's what God was shouting to us through this.

737
00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:38.975
Using this teenage girl, using this barren couple,

738
00:37:39.145 --> 00:37:41.295
using all the different environments

739
00:37:41.295 --> 00:37:42.815
that we'll see over the next couple chapters.

740
00:37:42.885 --> 00:37:45.055
What God was shouting to us is

741
00:37:45.055 --> 00:37:47.935
that salvation is his work, not ours.

742
00:37:49.805 --> 00:37:51.495
They couldn't manufacture the Messiah.

743
00:37:51.515 --> 00:37:53.215
Plenty of people tried along the way.

744
00:37:53.305 --> 00:37:54.535
We're gonna rebel against Rome.

745
00:37:54.535 --> 00:37:56.255
And they ended up getting squashed, right?

746
00:37:56.255 --> 00:37:58.215
They, they couldn't manufacture the Messiah,

747
00:37:58.555 --> 00:38:00.575
nor could they earn the Messiah.

748
00:38:02.005 --> 00:38:03.935
They couldn't deserve him. They couldn't be good enough.

749
00:38:04.155 --> 00:38:08.895
You can only receive the Messiah by faith

750
00:38:10.795 --> 00:38:13.335
and say with Mary, behold, I am your servant.

751
00:38:14.615 --> 00:38:16.395
Let it be to me, according to your word.

752
00:38:18.925 --> 00:38:20.135
This is the point of Christmas

753
00:38:20.135 --> 00:38:23.715
Church, This, that God has come.

754
00:38:25.625 --> 00:38:28.885
None of us deserved it, but

755
00:38:28.885 --> 00:38:31.125
because he's faithful to his promises, he

756
00:38:31.125 --> 00:38:34.255
Came Thousands of years of promises.

757
00:38:34.255 --> 00:38:36.045
He says, I'm gonna do, gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.

758
00:38:36.105 --> 00:38:38.485
I'm gonna do it. It's clear already in Luke one,

759
00:38:38.585 --> 00:38:41.285
God was weaving together this beautiful tapestry

760
00:38:41.465 --> 00:38:45.485
of all the promises showing up finally fully in Jesus

761
00:38:45.505 --> 00:38:47.285
Christ, the long awaited Messiah.

762
00:38:48.105 --> 00:38:50.365
It all culminates in this one.

763
00:38:50.385 --> 00:38:53.445
That's why you and I should never allow Christmas

764
00:38:53.905 --> 00:38:55.405
to become just sentimental.

765
00:38:57.165 --> 00:38:58.545
It should be about certainty

766
00:38:58.815 --> 00:39:00.665
that the promises find their yes

767
00:39:00.665 --> 00:39:03.065
and amen in Jesus Christ alone.

768
00:39:05.965 --> 00:39:09.185
And what that should do is should breed un expectant faith

769
00:39:09.895 --> 00:39:11.545
that if God could do all that,

770
00:39:13.275 --> 00:39:15.095
if God could keep his promises

771
00:39:15.235 --> 00:39:16.975
and show up like that,

772
00:39:17.205 --> 00:39:21.215
then expectant faith means when things look impossible.

773
00:39:21.575 --> 00:39:22.735
I don't have to be cynical

774
00:39:22.735 --> 00:39:24.495
because I serve a God of resurrection

775
00:39:25.475 --> 00:39:27.215
and I serve a God who's kept his promises

776
00:39:27.215 --> 00:39:28.535
for thousands upon thousands of years.

777
00:39:28.795 --> 00:39:30.175
Why would he stop now?

778
00:39:35.635 --> 00:39:37.295
And you might sit there and think, I'm unworthy.

779
00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:40.055
I don't deserve that kind of love.

780
00:39:42.945 --> 00:39:44.975
Don't let your unworthiness keep you from

781
00:39:44.975 --> 00:39:46.175
Christ this Christmas.

782
00:39:48.875 --> 00:39:52.055
In fact, your unworthiness is the only qualification you

783
00:39:52.055 --> 00:39:54.285
need to come to Christ.

784
00:39:55.865 --> 00:39:57.325
You realize you don't bring anything to the table,

785
00:39:57.345 --> 00:39:58.405
you don't have anything to offer.

786
00:39:58.465 --> 00:40:01.045
You are far from God. You are an enemy of God.

787
00:40:01.275 --> 00:40:03.765
That is the very thing that says, okay, you're in

788
00:40:04.795 --> 00:40:08.125
Because you see Jesus as the only hope, the only savior,

789
00:40:10.785 --> 00:40:13.795
because it's from promise to presence.

790
00:40:15.405 --> 00:40:16.625
The king has come.

791
00:40:19.135 --> 00:40:20.455
I wanna invite our worship leaders to come out.

792
00:40:20.455 --> 00:40:23.415
Now, I also wanna invite our prayer partners to go ahead

793
00:40:23.415 --> 00:40:24.735
and go to the sidewalls here

794
00:40:24.765 --> 00:40:27.095
because I wanna just explain for a second

795
00:40:27.365 --> 00:40:29.655
what those opportunities are for you.

796
00:40:31.485 --> 00:40:32.655
When we say prayer partners

797
00:40:32.655 --> 00:40:33.695
nearly every week, we talk about that.

798
00:40:33.915 --> 00:40:36.495
And, and what that means is that's an opportunity for you

799
00:40:37.155 --> 00:40:39.735
to go talk to someone, ask for prayer

800
00:40:40.175 --> 00:40:43.615
whenever you might need somebody else to, to have faith

801
00:40:43.675 --> 00:40:44.855
for you right now.

802
00:40:47.385 --> 00:40:48.845
And so here's a couple encouragement.

803
00:40:48.925 --> 00:40:51.685
I would just say if, if maybe you have felt

804
00:40:52.845 --> 00:40:56.375
Christmas become more sentimental, then certain,

805
00:40:58.755 --> 00:41:02.215
and you've maybe doubted that this thing is really real

806
00:41:02.275 --> 00:41:04.455
and it's just more about the lights and presents and,

807
00:41:04.555 --> 00:41:08.295
and cookies and things and you're, you're needing

808
00:41:08.315 --> 00:41:10.255
to just say, Hey, can you, can you pray

809
00:41:10.255 --> 00:41:14.735
that God would light afresh that fire in my heart of

810
00:41:14.895 --> 00:41:16.415
what Christmas is really about, of

811
00:41:16.415 --> 00:41:18.375
what Jesus is really about?

812
00:41:18.555 --> 00:41:20.455
And you ask for somebody to pray for you for that.

813
00:41:20.455 --> 00:41:24.135
That's one way to do that. Or maybe,

814
00:41:25.865 --> 00:41:28.255
maybe things do look impossible in your life right now.

815
00:41:29.765 --> 00:41:31.865
You got something going on, some situation

816
00:41:31.865 --> 00:41:33.580
that you feel like there's no way, no way out.

817
00:41:34.355 --> 00:41:38.725
This is hopeless. And you need somebody to just kind

818
00:41:38.725 --> 00:41:40.925
of believe for you for a second

819
00:41:42.005 --> 00:41:44.625
and pray for you that you can take a baby step

820
00:41:44.655 --> 00:41:45.705
into that kind of faith too.

821
00:41:45.725 --> 00:41:47.545
Go ask for prayer from them as well.

822
00:41:50.385 --> 00:41:53.925
Or maybe it's just, yeah, you feel unworthy.

823
00:41:55.065 --> 00:41:57.045
You've never seen this kind of love before.

824
00:41:57.045 --> 00:41:58.405
You've never seen this kind of Jesus,

825
00:41:58.875 --> 00:42:00.165
this kind of God before.

826
00:42:01.885 --> 00:42:03.065
And you just say, man, I,

827
00:42:03.225 --> 00:42:04.545
I don't, I don't know what that's like.

828
00:42:04.805 --> 00:42:07.385
Can you tell me what it means to really believe

829
00:42:07.805 --> 00:42:11.465
and have a relationship with that God, they would love

830
00:42:11.465 --> 00:42:12.505
to talk with you about that.

831
00:42:14.495 --> 00:42:16.745
From promise to presence. He has come.

832
00:42:19.045 --> 00:42:20.785
So at any point during the next few

833
00:42:20.785 --> 00:42:22.585
minutes, go talk to one of them.

834
00:42:23.085 --> 00:42:26.785
Go pray with them. Lord, we do pray in light

835
00:42:26.785 --> 00:42:31.155
of your word today that you would lead us

836
00:42:31.855 --> 00:42:36.515
to see you rightly, to see you as the God

837
00:42:36.515 --> 00:42:39.555
that you are the promise keeper.

838
00:42:42.545 --> 00:42:44.075
That not only do you make promises

839
00:42:44.075 --> 00:42:45.915
and you can't back it up, you've made the promises.

840
00:42:45.915 --> 00:42:48.075
You've proven that you have backed it up.

841
00:42:48.495 --> 00:42:51.115
We have no doubt, no question that you can do it again.

842
00:42:53.895 --> 00:42:55.595
And Lord, I know some of the stories in this room

843
00:42:55.595 --> 00:42:57.995
that are heavy feel impossible.

844
00:42:57.995 --> 00:43:02.355
But God, you are, you are not hindered.

845
00:43:02.355 --> 00:43:05.595
You are not worried. You are not concerned about what

846
00:43:05.615 --> 00:43:07.035
to us may seem impossible.

847
00:43:13.115 --> 00:43:15.635
I thank you for that foretaste of glory, divine

848
00:43:15.655 --> 00:43:16.795
of, of what is coming.

849
00:43:16.985 --> 00:43:19.875
Lord, we, we talk about how you,

850
00:43:20.815 --> 00:43:23.315
the Old Testament saints would've longed for you to come

851
00:43:23.315 --> 00:43:24.475
for the Messiah to show up.

852
00:43:24.475 --> 00:43:25.515
They were looking ahead to that.

853
00:43:25.615 --> 00:43:29.635
We know that you have come, but we also long for the day.

854
00:43:29.975 --> 00:43:33.435
You return Jesus and redeem it all and save us forever.

855
00:43:35.255 --> 00:43:38.395
And so when we sing this come thou long expected Jesus.

856
00:43:38.695 --> 00:43:41.155
We know they were praying that for you to come, Jesus,

857
00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:42.995
we're praying that for you to come again Jesus

858
00:43:44.895 --> 00:43:48.915
and to come reign in our hearts right now, help us trust you

859
00:43:50.385 --> 00:43:53.035
even today as we long for the day, you come back.

860
00:43:53.035 --> 00:43:56.275
Thank you God in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.

861
00:43:56.275 --> 00:43:57.675
Let's stand together for you're able and worship.
