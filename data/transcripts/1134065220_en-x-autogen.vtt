1
00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:27.845
Beans were hot.

2
00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:37.685
Somehow I got later

3
00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:42.125
it up and flick the juice on

4
00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:48.605
mostly.

5
00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:52.205
So come over and

6
00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:02.125
be, need to be.

7
00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:07.325
They were all day, all day still bubbling.

8
00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:08.045
When I pulled my,

9
00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:37.165
when was this?

10
00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:51.525
It went, I, oh yeah. Nothing on

11
00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:37.165
my skin is,

12
00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:48.525
can you get off?

13
00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:56.165
Get, I thought it was too,

14
00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:00.565
my team kind.

15
00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:02.565
I lost one because he's in the military.

16
00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:06.005
I another guy.

17
00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:12.365
Tomorrow I'll see if I can find

18
00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:15.245
out text.

19
00:05:04.635 --> 00:05:09.045
Good evening. Good evening. Are you guys blessed? Good.

20
00:05:09.435 --> 00:05:10.925
Good. Everybody have a good day.

21
00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:14.325
I, I don't know about you guys,

22
00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:17.805
but, um, one of the things that I feel

23
00:05:18.245 --> 00:05:21.445
whenever I come running this room on Wednesday night is

24
00:05:22.285 --> 00:05:26.445
I feel like my day has been full packed

25
00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:30.245
and I'm rushing to dinner and I'm rushing into this room,

26
00:05:30.745 --> 00:05:34.485
and I'm not quite getting to the point of

27
00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:39.285
peace where I can actually enjoy

28
00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:41.845
and appreciate God and what he's got.

29
00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:47.085
So, as we start, I don't know how you guys unwind.

30
00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:48.285
I don't, I don't know how you do it.

31
00:05:48.325 --> 00:05:51.765
I used to, uh, have these jobs that I'd get to work, uh,

32
00:05:51.865 --> 00:05:56.285
and I, my commute would be like 45 minutes to the job, used

33
00:05:56.285 --> 00:05:59.645
to lived in North Edmond, worked in El Reno, if

34
00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:01.205
that gives you any indication, right?

35
00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.685
One of the things that I loved about that was

36
00:06:05.545 --> 00:06:07.085
it gave me time to gear up in the morning,

37
00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:10.245
and it gave me time to wind down in the evening.

38
00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:12.485
And I got to spend time, quiet.

39
00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:15.125
Time on the way, quiet time on back. Come

40
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.125
Back.

41
00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:17.765
This isn't 45 minutes,

42
00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:19.445
but I'd like to take a couple minutes to pray

43
00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:23.805
as we start time so that we can get our minds

44
00:06:23.805 --> 00:06:25.245
and hearts calm.

45
00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:30.125
Go free. Well, God, thank you for today.

46
00:06:30.945 --> 00:06:32.885
Uh, thank you that each one of us

47
00:06:33.665 --> 00:06:36.565
and woke up this morning with breath in our lungs, father

48
00:06:36.635 --> 00:06:41.125
with energy and to roll out of bed, uh, father with a,

49
00:06:41.345 --> 00:06:44.925
an outlook on the things that we would be engaged in

50
00:06:45.665 --> 00:06:47.365
and, uh, do.

51
00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:50.605
If Father, I know that all those plans,

52
00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:53.125
if everybody in this room is like me, none

53
00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:56.085
of those plans always turn out the way that we want.

54
00:06:56.745 --> 00:06:58.765
Our days get crazy and we get hectic

55
00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:02.485
and, uh, father, we lose track of all of the plans

56
00:07:02.675 --> 00:07:06.525
that we had, and we do the things that, uh,

57
00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:08.005
oftentimes become urgent

58
00:07:08.385 --> 00:07:12.205
and we end up kind of getting just run through life.

59
00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:16.285
And I don't want that to be our time here tonight.

60
00:07:17.475 --> 00:07:20.765
Just pray that you would, so our minds

61
00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:23.565
and our hearts should remove the distractions of the day

62
00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:27.685
that you would allow us to enter into your presence,

63
00:07:28.745 --> 00:07:30.885
and that we might come to know you.

64
00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:36.005
That is our desire. It's in.

65
00:07:40.115 --> 00:07:43.725
Okay? So how'd you guys get here?

66
00:07:46.755 --> 00:07:47.885
Back seat in my son's spot.

67
00:07:51.065 --> 00:07:52.065
Not really the question,

68
00:07:55.545 --> 00:07:56.545
Why are You here?

69
00:07:56.585 --> 00:07:57.585
Why

70
00:07:59.165 --> 00:08:03.565
Glorify God that

71
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.685
that's the answer, right?

72
00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:08.245
I mean, that's certainly the answer we wanting.

73
00:08:08.305 --> 00:08:10.925
That's, that's the answer I want from all

74
00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:13.325
of our Bible students and everything.

75
00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:18.685
Um, oftentimes we really have to reflect on that question

76
00:08:19.025 --> 00:08:21.805
and the answer multiple times in a day,

77
00:08:22.905 --> 00:08:25.445
not just when we're in this room, right?

78
00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:30.205
Why am I here? How did I get here?

79
00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:34.965
So tonight, as we think about and talk about,

80
00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:37.805
and I want this to be dialogue, okay?

81
00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:42.205
As we think about, talk about the doctrine command, I want,

82
00:08:42.365 --> 00:08:45.245
I want us to think and talk about two things

83
00:08:46.065 --> 00:08:47.445
and really only two things.

84
00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:50.975
The first is our origin,

85
00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:53.935
and the second is our purpose.

86
00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:57.645
Okay? How did I get here?

87
00:08:59.025 --> 00:09:03.645
And what am I doing here now that I'm here, right?

88
00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:06.525
So as we,

89
00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:10.215
as we think about those things, how did we get here?

90
00:09:12.175 --> 00:09:14.065
What is our order here?

91
00:09:20.565 --> 00:09:23.225
My mom's name's Beverly and my dad's name's Robert.

92
00:09:23.645 --> 00:09:25.545
You know, we could talk about birds and bees

93
00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:26.665
and all that kind of stuff, but

94
00:09:26.725 --> 00:09:28.105
that's not really what I'm getting at.

95
00:09:28.805 --> 00:09:30.185
How did we get here?

96
00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:35.745
By the word of God speaking in the sin existence,

97
00:09:35.855 --> 00:09:39.665
created side of the work of the dirt, the word of God

98
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.345
speaking us into existence.

99
00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:47.905
The scriptures in Genesis chapter one begin with this,

100
00:09:48.215 --> 00:09:52.665
this concept, this term next to Hilo, out

101
00:09:52.765 --> 00:09:53.665
of nothing,

102
00:09:55.335 --> 00:09:58.105
something God created.

103
00:09:58.405 --> 00:10:00.905
All that was created out of nothing.

104
00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:04.105
So let's turn Genesis chapter one.

105
00:10:12.175 --> 00:10:16.225
Sure. At some point in time, all of us have, uh,

106
00:10:16.335 --> 00:10:17.745
learned and memorized.

107
00:10:18.045 --> 00:10:22.025
Day one, day two, day three, day four, day five, day six.

108
00:10:22.275 --> 00:10:25.385
Right? And then day seven, what happens on day seven?

109
00:10:26.295 --> 00:10:29.545
Rest rested, right? Okay.

110
00:10:30.245 --> 00:10:33.345
If you think about though day one through six,

111
00:10:34.575 --> 00:10:38.545
what was it that God created in those days?

112
00:10:39.825 --> 00:10:41.505
I don't need a, just think about

113
00:10:41.505 --> 00:10:42.545
all the things that God created.

114
00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:45.225
Give, give some examples, man.

115
00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:48.785
Energy and line,

116
00:10:49.555 --> 00:10:50.555
Space.

117
00:10:50.885 --> 00:10:53.705
Say that again. Space. Space, okay.

118
00:10:54.495 --> 00:10:56.025
Seasons, plants.

119
00:10:57.175 --> 00:11:01.425
Okay, with the planets came the sun

120
00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:06.665
and the moon and the stars and all of what we see.

121
00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:11.265
What about before the plan and

122
00:11:11.265 --> 00:11:15.745
before the sun, like light and darkness.

123
00:11:16.815 --> 00:11:21.545
Time, time began right at this point.

124
00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:28.545
What else? John plays all things.

125
00:11:29.045 --> 00:11:30.545
The ocean. The what?

126
00:11:30.845 --> 00:11:33.545
The book of John says he created all things, all things.

127
00:11:33.685 --> 00:11:36.785
He did. The ocean.

128
00:11:37.695 --> 00:11:40.065
What about what's in the ocean? All those things.

129
00:11:40.975 --> 00:11:45.745
Anybody at diver here? Yeah, man. Love it.

130
00:11:46.785 --> 00:11:48.665
I mean, really love being under the water.

131
00:11:48.685 --> 00:11:50.985
That's pretty sweet. If you haven't been under the

132
00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:52.545
water, you have no idea.

133
00:11:52.565 --> 00:11:53.885
The magical things that got.

134
00:11:56.635 --> 00:11:57.925
What about the things on the land,

135
00:11:59.305 --> 00:12:01.605
Air, water, All those, all the animals.

136
00:12:01.865 --> 00:12:03.285
All the current, you guys, you go

137
00:12:03.285 --> 00:12:04.605
to the zoo, you've been to the zoo, right?

138
00:12:04.915 --> 00:12:06.325
Yeah. What's your favorite zoo animal?

139
00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:10.165
All All of them. Pit boat.

140
00:12:11.805 --> 00:12:14.325
Actually mine or the is

141
00:12:14.325 --> 00:12:15.325
Mine.

142
00:12:15.905 --> 00:12:16.965
All the birds in the air.

143
00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:21.445
I mean, can you think of some magnificent things

144
00:12:21.555 --> 00:12:24.285
that God created out of?

145
00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:27.725
Nothing. Something God created.

146
00:12:28.025 --> 00:12:30.965
Can you think of magnificent things? Spider.

147
00:12:31.825 --> 00:12:33.685
Spider things will happen. Yeah,

148
00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:36.965
Because The spiders created, the cop has created, made.

149
00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:41.285
Spider. Spider. Just do it.

150
00:12:41.515 --> 00:12:42.515
Spiders. Just do it.

151
00:12:44.345 --> 00:12:45.645
Or just a baby think.

152
00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:49.765
I don't know how you could deny God and look at a baby.

153
00:12:50.795 --> 00:12:52.405
Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:12:53.025 --> 00:12:54.165
One of the greatest experiences

155
00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:56.005
of my life is watching my children be born.

156
00:12:56.925 --> 00:12:58.165
Probably the greatest experience

157
00:12:58.165 --> 00:13:00.165
of my life is watching my children.

158
00:13:02.435 --> 00:13:04.445
Something I could dare do.

159
00:13:05.245 --> 00:13:07.045
Watching someone else's children be born.

160
00:13:07.435 --> 00:13:09.325
Like that's disgusting.

161
00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:13.725
On the other hand, like that's special,

162
00:13:16.785 --> 00:13:21.365
but all of those things that God created,

163
00:13:22.425 --> 00:13:24.325
we could read all of the verses

164
00:13:24.425 --> 00:13:27.525
and see how he created the birds in the air

165
00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:29.565
and the fish in the sea and all of these things.

166
00:13:30.545 --> 00:13:35.405
God saved what scripture tells us is the best for last.

167
00:13:36.985 --> 00:13:37.985
And what was that?

168
00:13:43.595 --> 00:13:45.685
Yeah. So

169
00:13:47.385 --> 00:13:51.125
how do we get here? We're

170
00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:52.365
Creative.

171
00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:57.355
We were created by a God who is highly

172
00:13:58.435 --> 00:14:01.715
creative, very particular.

173
00:14:02.815 --> 00:14:07.155
We were created by a God who had a

174
00:14:07.665 --> 00:14:12.075
magnificent design that is so intricate

175
00:14:12.175 --> 00:14:15.275
and detailed that whether you believe

176
00:14:15.385 --> 00:14:18.155
that the earth is young at 6,000 years,

177
00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:21.675
or you believe that the earth is old at 6 million years,

178
00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:25.635
mankind still has not identified

179
00:14:25.695 --> 00:14:28.235
and understood all of its workings.

180
00:14:30.545 --> 00:14:33.315
That is the God that created us.

181
00:14:37.215 --> 00:14:42.035
So as mankind being created,

182
00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:46.715
we have to ask another question.

183
00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:53.245
Why? Why would God have created us?

184
00:14:57.715 --> 00:15:01.125
What are some of the things that, that the world might say?

185
00:15:02.195 --> 00:15:05.205
What are some of the arguments that the world might give?

186
00:15:06.315 --> 00:15:08.005
Someone needed to tend to the soil.

187
00:15:09.035 --> 00:15:11.685
Someone needed to tend to this way. Okay?

188
00:15:12.265 --> 00:15:14.685
He, he actually gave man a responsibility

189
00:15:15.105 --> 00:15:17.325
to do this right when you put him in the garden.

190
00:15:18.995 --> 00:15:19.995
Okay,

191
00:15:21.725 --> 00:15:22.725
I heard that one.

192
00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:25.965
Okay. A another need.

193
00:15:26.345 --> 00:15:30.925
So we've got a need here and a need here. Lonely. Okay?

194
00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:35.565
Why else? I read the word regents,

195
00:15:36.255 --> 00:15:37.485
which is a fancy word,

196
00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:41.365
but basically we're here to help carry out his glory

197
00:15:41.585 --> 00:15:43.725
and his order as in his lightness.

198
00:15:43.995 --> 00:15:46.045
Okay? Everything that he's made, he wants us

199
00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:47.765
to care and represent that.

200
00:15:47.825 --> 00:15:49.925
His love for his creation. Yeah.

201
00:15:49.985 --> 00:15:52.005
And we're his ambassadors or regions? Yeah.

202
00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:53.645
I mean they use the word regions. Yeah.

203
00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:55.685
So for sure, for sure.

204
00:15:56.745 --> 00:15:59.045
Listen, let's think about those things though.

205
00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:01.725
All of those things we just kind of came up with

206
00:16:02.155 --> 00:16:06.365
that weren't like these really specific, uh, biblical

207
00:16:06.885 --> 00:16:07.965
concepts, right?

208
00:16:08.985 --> 00:16:13.605
All of these have some concept in them that God somehow

209
00:16:14.185 --> 00:16:17.485
had a need for man,

210
00:16:19.995 --> 00:16:23.325
that there was a need to cultivate the soils

211
00:16:23.385 --> 00:16:25.445
and need for companionship.

212
00:16:25.495 --> 00:16:29.045
There was a need for fulfilling some thing,

213
00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:32.325
right? Is that true?

214
00:16:33.185 --> 00:16:34.325
No. No.

215
00:16:35.425 --> 00:16:37.165
Why? He

216
00:16:37.355 --> 00:16:38.355
Doesn't need anything.

217
00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:42.565
Like, God doesn't need it because he wants it.

218
00:16:43.385 --> 00:16:46.165
He did it because he wants, it ought to be fun

219
00:16:48.385 --> 00:16:49.385
For sure. He did it because

220
00:16:49.385 --> 00:16:50.725
he has got a love

221
00:16:50.825 --> 00:16:52.285
and that love that he shows.

222
00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:56.285
The father shows the son and he reflects it back to it.

223
00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:57.485
He does that again

224
00:16:57.485 --> 00:17:00.765
because he is a gift God that loves and he gives.

225
00:17:01.465 --> 00:17:03.645
So he created a being like that

226
00:17:06.665 --> 00:17:07.725
To display his glory.

227
00:17:10.805 --> 00:17:12.845
I want you to think about this, this concept of need,

228
00:17:12.845 --> 00:17:14.725
though a little bit further, right?

229
00:17:17.305 --> 00:17:20.725
God has an incommunicable

230
00:17:21.065 --> 00:17:22.725
and, sorry, I'm gonna start on that.

231
00:17:23.025 --> 00:17:27.525
An incommunicable attribute that he is

232
00:17:28.475 --> 00:17:30.325
independent of all things.

233
00:17:30.385 --> 00:17:33.245
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right? Okay.

234
00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:38.005
God doesn't need anything.

235
00:17:38.665 --> 00:17:42.085
The scriptures actually tell us that he's self existent.

236
00:17:42.705 --> 00:17:46.645
The scriptures tell us that he was not lonely.

237
00:17:47.075 --> 00:17:48.805
Look at John 17, five.

238
00:17:49.565 --> 00:17:52.045
Somebody pull that up for me real quick.

239
00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:57.165
Somebody else. Look up John 1724.

240
00:17:57.265 --> 00:17:59.565
So somebody get verse five, somebody get verse 24,

241
00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:04.325
And Now Father glorify me in your own presence

242
00:18:04.435 --> 00:18:08.205
with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.

243
00:18:09.445 --> 00:18:10.625
That's Jesus talking.

244
00:18:11.205 --> 00:18:12.705
So if we had a printed Bible,

245
00:18:12.705 --> 00:18:14.345
that'd be in red letters, right?

246
00:18:14.445 --> 00:18:17.105
Mm-hmm. That, that red letter tells us

247
00:18:17.105 --> 00:18:21.305
that Jesus was saying, Lord, when I was with you,

248
00:18:21.365 --> 00:18:25.105
we had this communion together,

249
00:18:26.925 --> 00:18:29.505
we have perfect relationship.

250
00:18:29.815 --> 00:18:34.225
Does that sound like a God who is needy of relationship?

251
00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:39.065
No. What about verse 24?

252
00:18:41.715 --> 00:18:45.505
Jesus speaking to the Father, father, I desire that

253
00:18:46.015 --> 00:18:50.705
they also, who you have given me be with me where I am,

254
00:18:51.125 --> 00:18:54.745
so that they may see my glory, which you have given me

255
00:18:55.725 --> 00:18:58.025
for you loved me before the foundations,

256
00:18:58.445 --> 00:18:59.505
the foundation of the Lord.

257
00:19:00.175 --> 00:19:02.465
Yeah. Love.

258
00:19:04.085 --> 00:19:06.225
Has anybody in here ever

259
00:19:07.535 --> 00:19:09.385
been loved?

260
00:19:14.845 --> 00:19:17.825
That's really brilliant. Sit. Yes.

261
00:19:20.455 --> 00:19:23.865
Okay. If, if you have been loved,

262
00:19:25.005 --> 00:19:28.985
do you know, can you be alone?

263
00:19:29.565 --> 00:19:34.425
Can you be needing companionship when you are in

264
00:19:34.495 --> 00:19:35.545
that relationship?

265
00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.325
No. Yeah.

266
00:19:41.105 --> 00:19:44.405
The, the need is completely fulfilled.

267
00:19:44.825 --> 00:19:47.645
But even more so than this, God

268
00:19:48.265 --> 00:19:50.325
didn't need it anyway.

269
00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:53.885
It's very difficult to understand

270
00:19:54.195 --> 00:19:56.005
that he would have been complete

271
00:19:56.105 --> 00:20:00.525
and perfect had any of that not ever existed.

272
00:20:03.275 --> 00:20:06.285
Okay? So he doesn't have a need.

273
00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:08.085
He's not lonely in that way.

274
00:20:08.505 --> 00:20:10.885
How about is he lacking something

275
00:20:10.885 --> 00:20:13.165
that may only man can provide?

276
00:20:13.865 --> 00:20:16.725
We, we've talked over here just in a negotiation that,

277
00:20:16.825 --> 00:20:19.205
you know, maybe man might have been created,

278
00:20:19.225 --> 00:20:21.565
the world might say to cultivate things.

279
00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:26.885
Is there some need that only man could fulfill?

280
00:20:29.425 --> 00:20:32.405
No, there's nothing like that.

281
00:20:33.305 --> 00:20:38.285
How about is there, um, did God lack longevity?

282
00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:44.485
Meaning God needed offspring

283
00:20:45.225 --> 00:20:48.685
to perpetuate some name,

284
00:20:49.105 --> 00:20:53.205
or God needed offspring to perpetuate some, you know,

285
00:20:53.205 --> 00:20:54.565
lifestyle or something like that?

286
00:20:54.705 --> 00:20:55.805
Did God need that?

287
00:20:57.955 --> 00:21:01.255
No, Because he's eternal, right?

288
00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:03.875
So

289
00:21:04.155 --> 00:21:07.815
He Didn't need in that way.

290
00:21:10.115 --> 00:21:12.655
I'm gonna challenge those concepts a little bit different

291
00:21:12.655 --> 00:21:13.735
way as well.

292
00:21:14.645 --> 00:21:18.815
Okay? We know God to be eternal.

293
00:21:22.295 --> 00:21:23.955
If I know God's eternal

294
00:21:25.255 --> 00:21:29.155
and I know that God is unchanging.

295
00:21:30.825 --> 00:21:35.635
Okay? Now, those two things, eternal and unchanging.

296
00:21:35.855 --> 00:21:40.635
If I suppose that God is need

297
00:21:42.095 --> 00:21:46.635
in some way, how long is God

298
00:21:46.685 --> 00:21:47.915
going to be needy?

299
00:21:50.785 --> 00:21:55.315
He's eternal forever. If he's, if he's eternal

300
00:21:55.455 --> 00:21:58.115
and he's unchanging, he's unchangeable,

301
00:21:58.295 --> 00:21:59.915
he will be needy forever.

302
00:22:01.345 --> 00:22:04.035
Okay? Why would a God,

303
00:22:05.655 --> 00:22:09.995
why would anybody create mankind

304
00:22:10.985 --> 00:22:12.155
that is temporary

305
00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:15.635
and flawed to fill a need that they cannot fill

306
00:22:16.175 --> 00:22:18.915
in a temporary way when the need is permanent?

307
00:22:21.705 --> 00:22:25.155
That doesn't make any sense at all.

308
00:22:29.095 --> 00:22:31.795
God didn't need us to create us.

309
00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:38.235
God created us for a purpose, though.

310
00:22:41.255 --> 00:22:45.035
So then why did God create us?

311
00:22:50.425 --> 00:22:53.035
Anybody? We have an answer.

312
00:22:54.205 --> 00:22:57.075
Could we go look maybe in that point of creation?

313
00:22:57.125 --> 00:22:59.035
Let's go back to Genesis chapter one.

314
00:22:59.175 --> 00:23:00.555
You guys were there just a minute ago.

315
00:23:04.625 --> 00:23:06.875
Look in verse start in verse 26.

316
00:23:08.965 --> 00:23:12.915
Let's read through verse 29.

317
00:23:15.415 --> 00:23:20.155
Yes, Genesis one verses 26

318
00:23:20.155 --> 00:23:24.075
through 29, Is what He,

319
00:23:25.265 --> 00:23:27.875
what Moses writes, then God said,

320
00:23:28.855 --> 00:23:33.835
let us make man in our image after our likeness,

321
00:23:35.175 --> 00:23:38.275
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea

322
00:23:38.415 --> 00:23:41.315
and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock,

323
00:23:41.335 --> 00:23:42.515
and over all the earth

324
00:23:42.935 --> 00:23:45.880
and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.

325
00:23:46.865 --> 00:23:51.645
So God created man in his own image, in the image

326
00:23:51.645 --> 00:23:56.165
of God, he created him, male and female, he created them,

327
00:23:57.655 --> 00:23:58.755
and God bless them.

328
00:23:59.175 --> 00:24:01.995
And God said to them, be fruitful and multiply

329
00:24:02.055 --> 00:24:03.835
and fill the earth and sub do it,

330
00:24:04.095 --> 00:24:06.155
and have dominion over the fish of the sea

331
00:24:06.155 --> 00:24:07.515
and over the birds of the heavens,

332
00:24:07.515 --> 00:24:10.675
and over every living thing that moves on the earth.

333
00:24:13.495 --> 00:24:14.755
And God said, behold,

334
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:17.555
I have given you every plant yielding seed

335
00:24:17.555 --> 00:24:19.475
that is on the face of all the earth

336
00:24:19.695 --> 00:24:22.995
and every tree with seed in its fruit.

337
00:24:23.735 --> 00:24:26.515
You shall have them for food.

338
00:24:29.375 --> 00:24:31.835
Why does it say that we were created

339
00:24:37.515 --> 00:24:37.715
dominion.

340
00:24:38.865 --> 00:24:43.755
Okay. Dominion to have rule over the earth

341
00:24:43.935 --> 00:24:45.195
and the things that end the earth.

342
00:24:45.825 --> 00:24:50.555
Okay? We, we care for his creation. Okay?

343
00:24:50.665 --> 00:24:52.635
It's part of the dominion, part of dominion.

344
00:24:52.635 --> 00:24:55.155
It's part of that caring for what he created, for sure.

345
00:24:55.335 --> 00:24:57.715
And you know, you're reflecting that love that he has

346
00:24:57.815 --> 00:25:00.435
for his creation, right? So,

347
00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:02.435
Well 'cause we was

348
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.795
made in his reflection, his image.

349
00:25:06.775 --> 00:25:11.675
Now he's, and he did that. He created us in his image.

350
00:25:12.175 --> 00:25:15.675
And so now as we create things multiply upon the earth,

351
00:25:15.815 --> 00:25:19.315
we are increasing his image.

352
00:25:19.455 --> 00:25:23.155
We are to bury his image and that multiply upon the earth.

353
00:25:23.305 --> 00:25:26.075
That is why, okay. Or his glo through that.

354
00:25:26.465 --> 00:25:29.635
Okay? Did you guys ca catch that?

355
00:25:30.985 --> 00:25:33.515
There's, there's a, a specific, uh,

356
00:25:37.275 --> 00:25:39.955
guidance here on what we're supposed to do

357
00:25:40.665 --> 00:25:43.595
that is fundamental to what David just shared.

358
00:25:44.625 --> 00:25:48.155
It's in this passage. What does it say?

359
00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:50.115
It says, we are to be something.

360
00:25:52.495 --> 00:25:55.195
His image, Not his image.

361
00:25:58.655 --> 00:26:01.395
Dan. Fruitful. Fruitful.

362
00:26:02.295 --> 00:26:05.755
We are to be fruitful and multiply. Right?

363
00:26:06.245 --> 00:26:08.955
We're to procreate later in scripture.

364
00:26:09.535 --> 00:26:13.435
God tells the people to fill the earth.

365
00:26:15.565 --> 00:26:18.075
We're getting close. We're not there yet. Right?

366
00:26:19.305 --> 00:26:21.195
Fill the earth. It's perforate.

367
00:26:22.015 --> 00:26:23.915
God doesn't just want us to procreate though.

368
00:26:25.135 --> 00:26:28.355
We, we know this because in Deuteronomy chapter six,

369
00:26:28.905 --> 00:26:30.755
when we look in Deuteronomy chapter six,

370
00:26:30.815 --> 00:26:34.075
it tells us exactly, not only are we procreate,

371
00:26:34.455 --> 00:26:38.155
but we are to train into our children

372
00:26:38.695 --> 00:26:40.555
and teach our offspring

373
00:26:40.775 --> 00:26:44.245
and raise them up in the ways of the Lord.

374
00:26:45.675 --> 00:26:48.925
That is really the multiplication of that,

375
00:26:49.715 --> 00:26:53.005
that God requires of us.

376
00:26:53.435 --> 00:26:57.445
When we look at Genesis chapter one, it is not enough

377
00:26:57.955 --> 00:27:02.725
that we should just simply create children.

378
00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:07.285
There's a purpose for those children to bear the image

379
00:27:07.285 --> 00:27:10.365
of God in the same way that we're designed.

380
00:27:11.435 --> 00:27:15.565
Okay? What else is in there?

381
00:27:21.665 --> 00:27:23.405
Oh, You keep saying

382
00:27:23.405 --> 00:27:25.005
that God made everything that was good.

383
00:27:25.475 --> 00:27:26.615
In fact, it was very good.

384
00:27:27.235 --> 00:27:29.615
And I wasn't joking earlier when I said he did it

385
00:27:29.615 --> 00:27:31.295
because he had, it was too fun to do.

386
00:27:31.605 --> 00:27:33.095
Yeah. And I was inspired by that

387
00:27:33.335 --> 00:27:36.015
'cause of Revelation four, which says that worthy of Lord

388
00:27:36.075 --> 00:27:37.335
to receive glory and honor

389
00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:39.415
and power without his created all things

390
00:27:39.955 --> 00:27:43.535
and for thy pleasure, they are and were created.

391
00:27:44.635 --> 00:27:45.655
He was pleased to do it.

392
00:27:47.155 --> 00:27:51.335
And so when we live out the purposes that he designed us

393
00:27:51.335 --> 00:27:53.935
to do that for now, that's one

394
00:27:53.935 --> 00:27:55.015
of the ways that we please him.

395
00:27:57.905 --> 00:28:00.295
Let's flip that. What did just said,

396
00:28:01.035 --> 00:28:02.135
how many parents in the room?

397
00:28:04.025 --> 00:28:07.135
Hands. Hands. That's awesome. Parents are the room.

398
00:28:07.525 --> 00:28:11.935
Have your children ever not done what you asked them to do?

399
00:28:15.875 --> 00:28:17.215
Double hands, double hands and thumb. Yeah.

400
00:28:17.275 --> 00:28:19.655
We don't need, we don't even need names.

401
00:28:19.925 --> 00:28:22.455
This current or past? Current or past.

402
00:28:23.805 --> 00:28:26.975
Have your children ever blatantly disobeyed

403
00:28:27.365 --> 00:28:29.175
what you told them to do?

404
00:28:31.605 --> 00:28:36.215
Have your children ever naively not done something

405
00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:38.735
that you expected them to do?

406
00:28:40.595 --> 00:28:42.655
In those, in all of those examples

407
00:28:42.675 --> 00:28:46.935
and all of those cases were, what was your,

408
00:28:48.075 --> 00:28:50.735
uh, receipt from that?

409
00:28:51.035 --> 00:28:53.295
How did you feel about that?

410
00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:57.975
Did you feel

411
00:28:59.325 --> 00:29:02.415
honored, respected?

412
00:29:03.795 --> 00:29:07.535
Did you feel that you were loved and cherished?

413
00:29:12.065 --> 00:29:14.255
Think about how God must feel

414
00:29:15.765 --> 00:29:18.495
with the sin that man

415
00:29:19.605 --> 00:29:22.335
Came with, right?

416
00:29:23.675 --> 00:29:25.375
We just see it in a fraction.

417
00:29:26.835 --> 00:29:29.135
God goes so much deeper into us,

418
00:29:29.915 --> 00:29:33.415
but yet we're designed to do all these things.

419
00:29:33.755 --> 00:29:35.095
You guys missed one by the way.

420
00:29:35.885 --> 00:29:37.535
Like we really need to look at this one.

421
00:29:37.795 --> 00:29:42.165
It, it's really important. It is actually in first 29.

422
00:29:43.505 --> 00:29:47.685
At the very end. It says, you shall have them for food.

423
00:29:48.465 --> 00:29:51.925
So God created us to do the most Baptist thing

424
00:29:52.065 --> 00:29:54.285
to ever be done, which is to eat.

425
00:29:54.985 --> 00:29:57.045
And if you want proof, all we have

426
00:29:57.045 --> 00:29:59.325
to do is walk down the hall, right?

427
00:30:01.655 --> 00:30:03.045
Maybe Trevor, yes.

428
00:30:04.805 --> 00:30:08.365
I think the be fruitful multiply is,

429
00:30:10.765 --> 00:30:12.605
I don't think we wait to read that

430
00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:14.205
to say, oh, you know what?

431
00:30:14.295 --> 00:30:15.805
Maybe kids are being a good thing.

432
00:30:16.985 --> 00:30:18.205
It seems more like,

433
00:30:20.315 --> 00:30:24.845
without even thinking too hard about it, couples who

434
00:30:25.465 --> 00:30:28.125
aren't kids think more

435
00:30:28.125 --> 00:30:32.045
or less unselfishly that they want to share their love with,

436
00:30:32.955 --> 00:30:35.445
with that person that they're gonna bring to the world.

437
00:30:36.945 --> 00:30:39.685
So that's a good thing. 'cause if we really thought

438
00:30:39.685 --> 00:30:41.965
logically, we might say, well,

439
00:30:42.595 --> 00:30:43.845
it's gonna cost a lot of money.

440
00:30:44.825 --> 00:30:47.325
It might not bring me joy all the time.

441
00:30:48.425 --> 00:30:50.925
So maybe, maybe not

442
00:30:54.635 --> 00:30:57.245
certainly an act of obedience,

443
00:30:57.265 --> 00:31:01.725
but also an act of blessing from the work, right?

444
00:31:03.065 --> 00:31:06.205
Um, I think it also has something to do with like,

445
00:31:06.795 --> 00:31:09.805
like a spiritual mentorship for other people.

446
00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:12.285
Like I think like if I don't have kids right now,

447
00:31:12.405 --> 00:31:16.405
I could still obey it and like disciple someone or something

448
00:31:16.425 --> 00:31:17.645
and leave them spiritually.

449
00:31:17.645 --> 00:31:19.605
And that would be like me multiplying

450
00:31:20.105 --> 00:31:21.105
Our people. Yeah.

451
00:31:21.105 --> 00:31:22.325
Which is very cool.

452
00:31:22.425 --> 00:31:25.605
So if we, if we were to kind of take a detour,

453
00:31:26.165 --> 00:31:29.165
I would detour us to Galatians chapter five and chapter six,

454
00:31:30.105 --> 00:31:32.685
and Galatians chapter five, what we're told

455
00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:35.365
by Paul is we're told that we have a responsibility

456
00:31:35.425 --> 00:31:38.245
to bear our own burdens and to actually grow in the Lord.

457
00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:40.445
And then he turns right around chapter six

458
00:31:40.445 --> 00:31:41.965
and he says, well, you know what?

459
00:31:41.965 --> 00:31:44.245
You're also responsible to bear one another's burdens

460
00:31:44.825 --> 00:31:45.845
in that same way.

461
00:31:46.345 --> 00:31:49.085
And I think that's absolutely the case we're talking about

462
00:31:49.085 --> 00:31:52.525
that it's a great, uh, great context we might go to,

463
00:31:52.905 --> 00:31:56.365
to talk about, uh, mentoring and meeting one another.

464
00:31:58.105 --> 00:32:03.045
Um, so in this,

465
00:32:03.345 --> 00:32:05.205
we find our purpose to glorify God.

466
00:32:05.425 --> 00:32:10.325
We talked about, to enjoy him and delighting him.

467
00:32:11.115 --> 00:32:13.125
Last week, Steve shared, uh,

468
00:32:13.185 --> 00:32:15.725
one comment on his notes on the first page, if you guys saw

469
00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:20.205
that, uh, was that the chief end of man is to

470
00:32:20.965 --> 00:32:22.845
glorify God and enjoy him forever.

471
00:32:22.845 --> 00:32:26.325
Him, right? We see a lot of, uh,

472
00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:28.965
glorifying God, enjoying

473
00:32:28.985 --> 00:32:32.045
and delighting in him those just as equally as important.

474
00:32:32.045 --> 00:32:33.165
Look at Romans five.

475
00:32:49.785 --> 00:32:51.645
Romans five is sergeant verse one.

476
00:32:56.275 --> 00:32:59.365
Paul writes, therefore, since we have been justified

477
00:32:59.505 --> 00:33:02.045
by faith, we have peace with God

478
00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:04.165
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

479
00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:08.525
Through him, we have also obtained access by faith

480
00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:10.565
and the disgrace in which we stand.

481
00:33:11.185 --> 00:33:15.445
And we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

482
00:33:16.385 --> 00:33:18.805
Not only that, but we rejoice on our sufferings knowing

483
00:33:18.805 --> 00:33:20.765
that suffering produces endurance

484
00:33:21.265 --> 00:33:23.005
and endurance produces character.

485
00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:24.325
A character produces hope.

486
00:33:24.825 --> 00:33:27.245
And hope does not put us to shame

487
00:33:27.475 --> 00:33:30.685
because God's love has been poured into our hearts,

488
00:33:30.685 --> 00:33:34.085
through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

489
00:33:35.485 --> 00:33:37.645
We're rejoice in the hope of God.

490
00:33:39.275 --> 00:33:42.005
Look, look also at one Thessalonians chapter five

491
00:33:58.155 --> 00:34:00.445
star in verse 16 through 18.

492
00:34:02.235 --> 00:34:05.835
Rejoice always pray without ceasing.

493
00:34:05.835 --> 00:34:08.675
Give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of God

494
00:34:09.175 --> 00:34:11.795
and Christ Jesus for you,

495
00:34:12.595 --> 00:34:15.075
rejoice always to rejoice in him.

496
00:34:15.945 --> 00:34:17.595
Look, these, these go together

497
00:34:17.745 --> 00:34:19.635
because we're praying without ceasing.

498
00:34:19.655 --> 00:34:21.115
Who is it that we bring to?

499
00:34:24.575 --> 00:34:26.635
We give thanks in all circumstances.

500
00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:28.315
Who is it that we give thanks to?

501
00:34:30.255 --> 00:34:33.315
We give thanks to the one that is in control of

502
00:34:33.575 --> 00:34:35.755
and command all things.

503
00:34:36.535 --> 00:34:39.515
And from whose hand, all good things come

504
00:34:42.125 --> 00:34:43.125
Right.

505
00:34:46.095 --> 00:34:50.315
Lastly, one Peter, turn over.

506
00:34:50.315 --> 00:34:51.635
First Peter chapter one,

507
00:34:58.405 --> 00:34:59.875
verse eight and nine.

508
00:35:02.175 --> 00:35:04.915
Though you have not seen him, you love him,

509
00:35:05.575 --> 00:35:09.235
though you do not now see him, you believe in him

510
00:35:09.575 --> 00:35:13.315
and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible

511
00:35:13.895 --> 00:35:17.595
and filled with glory, obtaining the of your faith,

512
00:35:17.695 --> 00:35:20.235
the salvation of your souls.

513
00:35:22.535 --> 00:35:24.715
We have a purpose.

514
00:35:25.495 --> 00:35:30.195
If someone asks you the question, why are you here?

515
00:35:32.965 --> 00:35:34.475
Don't think about the tactical.

516
00:35:36.725 --> 00:35:40.005
Think about this strategically, think about the purpose.

517
00:35:40.815 --> 00:35:43.685
Think about why am I really here?

518
00:35:45.535 --> 00:35:47.225
When you're walking down the odds of Walmart,

519
00:35:47.925 --> 00:35:49.185
why am I really here?

520
00:35:49.655 --> 00:35:51.345
There's a person you're passing here

521
00:35:51.345 --> 00:35:52.905
and there's a person I'm passing here

522
00:35:52.905 --> 00:35:56.185
and there's a person I'm gonna talk to at the,

523
00:35:56.365 --> 00:35:57.945
at the counter when I check out.

524
00:35:58.955 --> 00:36:02.425
Maybe sometimes because times we like fly through

525
00:36:02.425 --> 00:36:04.305
that self checkout thing, right?

526
00:36:05.835 --> 00:36:10.345
Think about that. I

527
00:36:10.745 --> 00:36:12.465
I think it's, it's really interesting.

528
00:36:12.465 --> 00:36:15.665
This next question I've got is what does it really mean?

529
00:36:15.855 --> 00:36:19.825
This to be made in the image of God,

530
00:36:20.365 --> 00:36:21.425
to bear this image?

531
00:36:21.455 --> 00:36:25.825
What does that mean when I don't know how many

532
00:36:25.825 --> 00:36:28.505
of you guys are actually like, have a book and read book

533
00:36:28.505 --> 00:36:30.065
and all that, or just come to

534
00:36:32.485 --> 00:36:33.825
the time we have together.

535
00:36:34.005 --> 00:36:37.185
But in the particular chapter here

536
00:36:37.725 --> 00:36:40.585
on the origin man, um,

537
00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:43.105
Gruten goes into some great detail

538
00:36:43.685 --> 00:36:47.625
and builds an argument around why we really don't need to,

539
00:36:47.845 --> 00:36:51.785
you know, be very specific about what it means

540
00:36:51.845 --> 00:36:53.105
to be in the image of God.

541
00:36:53.815 --> 00:36:57.345
That all these scholars have gone to this great, uh, pains

542
00:36:57.525 --> 00:37:00.745
and, you know, built great arguments for it and everything.

543
00:37:01.445 --> 00:37:05.945
And Gruder says that it is essentially

544
00:37:06.525 --> 00:37:11.385
for us to pour into the word

545
00:37:12.565 --> 00:37:17.145
and everything we come to know about gout is

546
00:37:18.455 --> 00:37:22.505
what that is the image of gout.

547
00:37:23.525 --> 00:37:24.785
All the things that we can think about.

548
00:37:26.005 --> 00:37:30.305
But yet there's some things that we might say, man,

549
00:37:30.525 --> 00:37:32.265
may not have gotten for God.

550
00:37:33.935 --> 00:37:35.515
But let's talk for a minute about

551
00:37:38.345 --> 00:37:39.915
what this means.

552
00:37:41.415 --> 00:37:42.875
Um, page 2 36.

553
00:37:42.875 --> 00:37:46.795
In the, in the book says this, groom writes,

554
00:37:46.895 --> 00:37:51.795
the text only needs to affirm that man is like God.

555
00:37:52.735 --> 00:37:56.595
And the rest of scripture fills in more details

556
00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:57.795
to explain this.

557
00:37:59.415 --> 00:38:01.755
In fact, as we read the rest of scripture, we realize

558
00:38:01.755 --> 00:38:03.955
that a full understanding of man's likeness

559
00:38:03.955 --> 00:38:08.355
to God would require a full understanding of who God is

560
00:38:08.975 --> 00:38:11.675
in his being and in his actions,

561
00:38:12.015 --> 00:38:15.395
and a full understanding of who man is

562
00:38:15.655 --> 00:38:17.315
and what he does.

563
00:38:20.835 --> 00:38:24.875
I love this. He's spot on

564
00:38:26.855 --> 00:38:28.355
our community group in college

565
00:38:28.355 --> 00:38:30.515
and young adults, uh, about,

566
00:38:31.315 --> 00:38:34.285
it's probably been about a year ago now, we actually, uh,

567
00:38:34.315 --> 00:38:39.125
went through a systematic theology that happens

568
00:38:39.345 --> 00:38:41.485
to be all of the questions

569
00:38:42.075 --> 00:38:45.525
that we ask our deacons to fill out

570
00:38:46.235 --> 00:38:49.245
from a doctrinal perspective so

571
00:38:49.245 --> 00:38:50.805
that we can ensure from a church

572
00:38:51.155 --> 00:38:54.245
that they are doctrinally aligned with us.

573
00:38:56.385 --> 00:39:00.485
And I, I did a little experiment with everyone

574
00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:02.565
because those questions are put in a,

575
00:39:02.585 --> 00:39:04.365
in a particular order, okay?

576
00:39:04.365 --> 00:39:07.605
They're not just randomly 40 to semi questions.

577
00:39:07.835 --> 00:39:09.445
They're put in a particular order.

578
00:39:10.985 --> 00:39:12.965
And I asked everybody when we started,

579
00:39:13.105 --> 00:39:14.365
you know, we did a, a summary.

580
00:39:15.065 --> 00:39:17.885
We, we went through and said why we're doing this?

581
00:39:17.985 --> 00:39:19.725
And we talked about kind of opening it up,

582
00:39:20.585 --> 00:39:22.565
handed out all the 40 questions to everybody.

583
00:39:22.665 --> 00:39:25.925
And I said, Hey. I said, where would you guys like to start?

584
00:39:26.535 --> 00:39:28.125
Where do you want to begin?

585
00:39:29.825 --> 00:39:32.085
Any guesses where everybody wanted to begin?

586
00:39:33.945 --> 00:39:37.245
30 to 40 we're pretty far down the list.

587
00:39:37.585 --> 00:39:39.485
We were like smack dab in the middle somewhere.

588
00:39:39.745 --> 00:39:41.445
And it was actually, we started out

589
00:39:41.825 --> 00:39:44.045
and it had to do with the doctrine of sin.

590
00:39:46.225 --> 00:39:49.725
Man, I tell you what, like God couldn't have set this thing

591
00:39:49.725 --> 00:39:50.885
up any better, right?

592
00:39:50.995 --> 00:39:54.445
Because we got right into the doctrine of sin

593
00:39:54.445 --> 00:39:56.165
and we were starting to talk about it.

594
00:39:56.465 --> 00:39:58.125
And in order to understand

595
00:39:58.225 --> 00:40:00.765
and talk about the doctrine of sin, in order

596
00:40:00.825 --> 00:40:04.045
to grasp it at all, you have to grasp

597
00:40:04.265 --> 00:40:07.845
and you have understand that there is a holy God

598
00:40:08.235 --> 00:40:11.685
that is completely perfect in all of his attributes.

599
00:40:11.835 --> 00:40:14.805
Because sin is anything that contradicts

600
00:40:15.395 --> 00:40:16.885
what those attributes are.

601
00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:20.605
We have to understand the doctrine of God first.

602
00:40:22.835 --> 00:40:26.725
What drew him saying here is absolutely the same thing

603
00:40:26.905 --> 00:40:28.045
for the doctrine of man.

604
00:40:28.345 --> 00:40:31.085
In order for us to understand the doctrine of man

605
00:40:31.105 --> 00:40:35.765
and our purpose, our ability to actually reflect the

606
00:40:36.325 --> 00:40:38.045
likeness and the being

607
00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:41.805
and the image of him in this world, we have

608
00:40:41.805 --> 00:40:43.165
to understand God.

609
00:40:45.585 --> 00:40:49.125
It is the fundamental for everything

610
00:40:50.035 --> 00:40:51.245
that we do.

611
00:40:52.635 --> 00:40:53.525
Just to understand.

612
00:40:57.345 --> 00:40:59.085
So back to the question.

613
00:41:00.065 --> 00:41:02.085
In what ways do we

614
00:41:02.975 --> 00:41:05.085
share this image of God?

615
00:41:09.025 --> 00:41:13.965
United Word. Okay? Kindness is an attribute of God.

616
00:41:14.665 --> 00:41:17.285
Our kindness is one.

617
00:41:18.295 --> 00:41:22.205
Relational, Relational. Explain that.

618
00:41:24.425 --> 00:41:28.445
How we love others through kindness, how we respect them,

619
00:41:28.545 --> 00:41:31.245
how we love them, and knows our family.

620
00:41:31.245 --> 00:41:32.965
Whoever that everyone, yeah,

621
00:41:33.385 --> 00:41:34.725
Family, neighbors.

622
00:41:34.905 --> 00:41:39.325
He created his head's why he made that.

623
00:41:39.435 --> 00:41:41.965
That was the whole reason he made, had eve,

624
00:41:42.235 --> 00:41:44.685
took Eve from Adam's side, is so

625
00:41:44.685 --> 00:41:46.285
that they could have the relationship.

626
00:41:46.385 --> 00:41:49.845
He wasn't made just to be a single person human as

627
00:41:49.945 --> 00:41:51.205
for a relationship.

628
00:41:53.225 --> 00:41:54.685
We, we hadn't talked about that.

629
00:41:55.105 --> 00:41:59.885
So Genesis chapter one tells us this general

630
00:42:01.165 --> 00:42:06.085
creation, Genesis chapter two tells us specific account of

631
00:42:06.085 --> 00:42:09.605
that creation with daily leadership referring to, yeah.

632
00:42:12.065 --> 00:42:13.065
How about physically?

633
00:42:14.825 --> 00:42:18.725
No. No. Why not

634
00:42:20.975 --> 00:42:21.975
God's spirit.

635
00:42:22.625 --> 00:42:26.005
God is spirit, which is another act.

636
00:42:26.875 --> 00:42:28.045
John 4 22.

637
00:42:29.205 --> 00:42:31.845
Absolutely. Well, when God appeared to Abraham,

638
00:42:32.225 --> 00:42:33.565
he also had a human, Peter.

639
00:42:34.065 --> 00:42:35.565
That's right, that's right.

640
00:42:36.035 --> 00:42:37.605
When God appeared to Abraham,

641
00:42:37.745 --> 00:42:40.685
God appeared in several different times in the

642
00:42:40.685 --> 00:42:42.045
Old Testament before, right?

643
00:42:42.465 --> 00:42:43.925
We know those to be theos

644
00:42:44.625 --> 00:42:48.565
and those thes are all time periods when we believe

645
00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:52.725
that Jesus is the one that appeared with Adam

646
00:42:53.025 --> 00:42:54.845
and in representation of God.

647
00:42:55.365 --> 00:42:59.085
Absolutely. But David,

648
00:42:59.745 --> 00:43:03.565
to your point, John, uh, 4 24 does tell us

649
00:43:03.565 --> 00:43:05.325
that God is spirit.

650
00:43:07.115 --> 00:43:09.565
John one 18 says

651
00:43:09.715 --> 00:43:12.805
that no one has seen God.

652
00:43:14.015 --> 00:43:18.925
Right? You remember when Moses was in the,

653
00:43:19.215 --> 00:43:21.605
sorry, David was in the cliff, right?

654
00:43:21.875 --> 00:43:25.165
He's wanting to see God got passes by God says,

655
00:43:25.165 --> 00:43:28.525
you gotta turn your back and just the wind goes right.

656
00:43:28.755 --> 00:43:32.565
Another example of that God is invisible.

657
00:43:32.975 --> 00:43:34.245
Colossians one 15.

658
00:43:36.165 --> 00:43:39.905
So when we look at ourselves in the image of God, I think

659
00:43:39.905 --> 00:43:40.945
From a mankind

660
00:43:40.945 --> 00:43:43.785
Perspective, we oftentimes think about

661
00:43:44.675 --> 00:43:47.145
y'all must have arms and legs and fingers and toes. No.

662
00:43:47.145 --> 00:43:49.825
Doesn't. When you can, you assume

663
00:43:49.855 --> 00:43:52.985
that spirit doesn't have a form ness.

664
00:43:53.975 --> 00:43:56.625
What about you remember donkey, the be

665
00:43:57.285 --> 00:44:02.065
he was rid on the donkey, donkey saw, end with this word

666
00:44:03.685 --> 00:44:05.265
saw bigger of the spirit,

667
00:44:05.635 --> 00:44:06.635
Right? So

668
00:44:06.635 --> 00:44:09.225
you not, you cannot assume

669
00:44:09.225 --> 00:44:12.585
that also spirit could have form kind of form.

670
00:44:12.815 --> 00:44:13.815
Yeah,

671
00:44:15.355 --> 00:44:17.265
We're for angels, we're told all kinds

672
00:44:17.265 --> 00:44:18.825
of things about their design, right?

673
00:44:18.985 --> 00:44:21.505
I mean, they have crazy number of wings

674
00:44:21.565 --> 00:44:25.265
and they have, you know, these very scary types of images

675
00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:26.505
that are described in scripture.

676
00:44:26.725 --> 00:44:28.665
So, um, that's,

677
00:44:28.765 --> 00:44:30.945
that's not when we're talking about God though,

678
00:44:31.225 --> 00:44:35.925
God has taken on his spirit home. Right?

679
00:44:36.685 --> 00:44:38.565
I was gonna say, try to lead off of that, to try

680
00:44:38.565 --> 00:44:41.245
and give like a better visual example is like when you're

681
00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:42.485
talking about the image of God,

682
00:44:42.495 --> 00:44:44.525
we're not specifically talking about something physical

683
00:44:44.525 --> 00:44:46.405
because then you can apply that to anyone.

684
00:44:46.465 --> 00:44:48.845
So it's like, if you think God is a physical being like

685
00:44:48.845 --> 00:44:51.845
Jesus than like people who are women or have no arms

686
00:44:52.025 --> 00:44:53.925
or born this way, that doesn't mean they're any

687
00:44:53.925 --> 00:44:55.165
less of an individual God.

688
00:44:55.985 --> 00:44:58.165
So like, yes, God is physical as in Jesus,

689
00:44:58.465 --> 00:44:59.605
But good point.

690
00:44:59.605 --> 00:45:02.765
That's not the thing. Trevor.

691
00:45:04.685 --> 00:45:08.925
I think one thing that is interesting for me to think about

692
00:45:09.665 --> 00:45:12.805
is that our bodies do speak about God.

693
00:45:13.515 --> 00:45:16.845
Like we have ears and God ears, we have mouths

694
00:45:16.845 --> 00:45:18.965
and God speaks, we have eyes

695
00:45:18.985 --> 00:45:20.645
and God sees, you know what I mean?

696
00:45:20.835 --> 00:45:22.525
Like there are things about our bodies that

697
00:45:23.195 --> 00:45:24.525
reflect the nature of God,

698
00:45:25.425 --> 00:45:28.085
but not in like a physical form, not a physical

699
00:45:28.085 --> 00:45:28.805
Field. Yeah.

700
00:45:29.105 --> 00:45:32.045
And especially like you're talking about the triune

701
00:45:33.505 --> 00:45:35.045
in his fullness

702
00:45:35.315 --> 00:45:39.405
because you, we would say the top of sun, uh,

703
00:45:39.585 --> 00:45:42.765
pre carbonate sun seemed assume form

704
00:45:43.315 --> 00:45:44.685
certainly took on flesh.

705
00:45:45.945 --> 00:45:49.165
So, so God in Christ now has a body, right?

706
00:45:49.585 --> 00:45:51.045
But that's different than, yeah.

707
00:45:53.395 --> 00:45:55.725
Good points. One More. I have one

708
00:45:55.725 --> 00:45:56.845
More. Yeah, one more.

709
00:45:56.945 --> 00:46:00.085
Uh, what I say, we are man is created an energy.

710
00:46:00.105 --> 00:46:03.205
God, if we were to also consider how

711
00:46:04.095 --> 00:46:08.165
human kind is separate from all their creative beings, uh,

712
00:46:08.445 --> 00:46:12.205
I would say that we have a six, we have hope,

713
00:46:12.225 --> 00:46:14.005
dreams, we can plan.

714
00:46:14.185 --> 00:46:17.765
We love all their creative beings do not have

715
00:46:17.765 --> 00:46:19.485
that conscience

716
00:46:19.995 --> 00:46:24.885
Consciousness that, so in, in addition

717
00:46:24.885 --> 00:46:27.445
to relational, you hit nail on the head.

718
00:46:27.445 --> 00:46:30.605
There's kind of three other moral, spiritual, and mental.

719
00:46:32.745 --> 00:46:37.525
We morally have these guides

720
00:46:37.525 --> 00:46:40.805
that we know to be true, right?

721
00:46:41.065 --> 00:46:45.605
To follow, um, spiritual aspects as well.

722
00:46:45.665 --> 00:46:50.325
Mental aspects, the ability to think and collegiate.

723
00:46:50.425 --> 00:46:53.125
We as human beings are able to,

724
00:46:53.265 --> 00:46:58.005
and have continued to make things more complicated, right?

725
00:46:59.105 --> 00:47:01.725
We, we share in the attribute

726
00:47:02.075 --> 00:47:05.325
that God perfectly displayed in creation.

727
00:47:05.985 --> 00:47:09.925
We create oftentimes, unfortunately, our own turmoil

728
00:47:12.665 --> 00:47:13.685
we share in those things.

729
00:47:15.385 --> 00:47:19.815
So how do you feel like man's doing

730
00:47:20.835 --> 00:47:23.015
in fulfilling this purpose

731
00:47:29.165 --> 00:47:30.085
with the people I run with?

732
00:47:31.395 --> 00:47:36.205
Okay, the church is like Lebanon alone.

733
00:47:36.875 --> 00:47:40.805
Yeah. Over time, I think about today compared

734
00:47:40.805 --> 00:47:42.085
to 4,000 years ago,

735
00:47:43.105 --> 00:47:47.645
and I'm encouraged time horizon

736
00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:55.605
human kind is multiplying is the fruitfulness

737
00:47:55.745 --> 00:47:56.845
that's individual.

738
00:47:58.585 --> 00:48:00.885
The actual disc point of God's image, right

739
00:48:00.885 --> 00:48:02.725
through the multiplication Absolutely.

740
00:48:03.645 --> 00:48:06.805
Question. These are, these are things that we're,

741
00:48:06.805 --> 00:48:10.405
we're not gonna get into any detail with time, right?

742
00:48:11.105 --> 00:48:14.325
So over the next couple weeks, as we continue

743
00:48:14.325 --> 00:48:18.325
to talk about document manage what's coming up in two weeks,

744
00:48:18.525 --> 00:48:21.485
I think from now month, um, couple weeks from now,

745
00:48:22.055 --> 00:48:23.605
we'll talk more about those things.

746
00:48:23.665 --> 00:48:26.805
You're absolutely right. We don't know.

747
00:48:27.705 --> 00:48:29.045
We, well, first of all,

748
00:48:29.705 --> 00:48:32.365
we know from scripture multiple places, right?

749
00:48:33.145 --> 00:48:35.405
Man does not seek after God.

750
00:48:37.825 --> 00:48:42.605
So if God's image is so important, if us knowing him is

751
00:48:42.665 --> 00:48:47.165
so important to us, reflecting the image that he, uh,

752
00:48:47.265 --> 00:48:52.125
put into us to display, then we should

753
00:48:52.835 --> 00:48:53.885
seek after God.

754
00:48:54.355 --> 00:48:58.245
Because the only way we're going to be able to do that is

755
00:48:58.245 --> 00:49:00.725
to know who he is, right?

756
00:49:01.385 --> 00:49:02.405
To understand.

757
00:49:03.985 --> 00:49:07.645
We can't exhaust our knowledge

758
00:49:07.645 --> 00:49:09.565
and understanding in the side.

759
00:49:11.095 --> 00:49:13.645
Those Ians 13, the end of the very end

760
00:49:13.645 --> 00:49:17.465
of the chapter tells us what tells us.

761
00:49:17.525 --> 00:49:21.665
We are known. In part we,

762
00:49:21.765 --> 00:49:24.145
we know in part, but we are known fully.

763
00:49:24.285 --> 00:49:26.785
And when we see him, we will know him

764
00:49:27.005 --> 00:49:29.585
as he knows us, right?

765
00:49:30.965 --> 00:49:35.545
So when we think about the whole process of our salvation,

766
00:49:36.125 --> 00:49:37.905
we can start with justification

767
00:49:38.445 --> 00:49:41.385
and we can go through sanctification and sanctification.

768
00:49:41.535 --> 00:49:46.105
Just think of it simply as a continuous process of

769
00:49:47.075 --> 00:49:51.145
confession, repentance, confession, repentance over

770
00:49:51.285 --> 00:49:52.865
and over and over again.

771
00:49:53.395 --> 00:49:55.065
Until we are becoming like,

772
00:49:55.205 --> 00:49:58.065
but we'll not be like until are

773
00:49:58.865 --> 00:50:00.745
glorified in his presence.

774
00:50:01.215 --> 00:50:05.905
When we'll know him fully, then we'll be like him.

775
00:50:06.615 --> 00:50:07.985
Okay? Back into that.

776
00:50:09.725 --> 00:50:12.305
So den talks about one other thing, I'm going to just kind

777
00:50:12.305 --> 00:50:14.385
of, uh, close on this bit of conversation.

778
00:50:14.405 --> 00:50:15.665
We only have a few minutes left.

779
00:50:16.565 --> 00:50:20.345
Um, here talks about one other thing, um,

780
00:50:21.605 --> 00:50:24.505
and that is this image.

781
00:50:27.785 --> 00:50:30.445
He talks about it in terms of being

782
00:50:31.115 --> 00:50:33.485
damaged, not destroyed.

783
00:50:37.025 --> 00:50:38.025
So what did you say?

784
00:50:39.355 --> 00:50:41.845
True? Who says truth?

785
00:50:42.885 --> 00:50:45.805
I said damaged, not destroyed. How so?

786
00:50:46.755 --> 00:50:47.845
Well, it even says that

787
00:50:47.855 --> 00:50:52.005
after the fall in three, in five, one and nine, six

788
00:50:52.745 --> 00:50:57.245
and Genesis, it states that the real well, nine, six,

789
00:50:57.385 --> 00:50:59.405
it states that they can't commit murder.

790
00:50:59.625 --> 00:51:01.965
Not to commit murder because we are man is

791
00:51:01.965 --> 00:51:03.125
made in the image of God.

792
00:51:03.395 --> 00:51:05.565
Stewart's still, were still buried after the fall.

793
00:51:06.195 --> 00:51:08.725
That image you got even

794
00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:11.525
in, forgot the verse.

795
00:51:11.625 --> 00:51:13.725
But in the New Testament talking about,

796
00:51:13.805 --> 00:51:16.365
I think it's James three nine Target, we're not

797
00:51:16.365 --> 00:51:17.405
to cursing another person

798
00:51:17.405 --> 00:51:19.405
because they are made into gun, not to spark.

799
00:51:19.405 --> 00:51:22.165
Talk about, about not to do harm to, yeah.

800
00:51:24.515 --> 00:51:29.085
What perspectives should that give us of how we engage

801
00:51:29.145 --> 00:51:32.525
and treat and interact with others that are not

802
00:51:38.945 --> 00:51:39.325
Do what

803
00:51:44.005 --> 00:51:48.325
I, we would treat one another with this respect

804
00:51:49.065 --> 00:51:50.065
And Attention.

805
00:51:51.225 --> 00:51:53.285
We wouldn't, we would treat one another that way.

806
00:51:53.385 --> 00:51:58.245
Why should we treat any of other, any of God's other created

807
00:51:59.415 --> 00:51:59.765
About

808
00:52:03.355 --> 00:52:04.845
Potentially greater care?

809
00:52:06.055 --> 00:52:07.285
David Saying you treat

810
00:52:07.315 --> 00:52:08.605
Potentially greater care.

811
00:52:13.985 --> 00:52:16.805
He said potentially greater care for those

812
00:52:16.835 --> 00:52:18.885
that are not yet.

813
00:52:21.915 --> 00:52:26.245
Because our aim is what reconciliation.

814
00:52:26.785 --> 00:52:29.045
Our aim is rec reconciliation, not

815
00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:30.365
with us, no reconciliation.

816
00:52:30.535 --> 00:52:32.365
We've got ministry of reconciliation,

817
00:52:32.725 --> 00:52:33.805
ministry of reconciliation.

818
00:52:34.585 --> 00:52:37.645
Our aim is to display the of God

819
00:52:37.665 --> 00:52:42.165
before our aim is to, is for them to then

820
00:52:42.795 --> 00:52:46.365
display the image of God that they were created in, right?

821
00:52:46.625 --> 00:52:48.965
Yes. Over and over and

822
00:52:48.965 --> 00:52:49.965
Over again.

823
00:52:52.905 --> 00:52:54.565
So man,

824
00:53:05.395 --> 00:53:09.685
that so that we might bring

825
00:53:14.345 --> 00:53:17.685
our obedience in our

826
00:53:19.115 --> 00:53:21.885
procreation, our obedience in teaching

827
00:53:21.885 --> 00:53:24.405
and training our children and others around us.

828
00:53:24.625 --> 00:53:27.805
Our obedience in making disciples

829
00:53:29.745 --> 00:53:33.805
is of the utmost importance to us.

830
00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:39.045
That's main and purpose.

831
00:53:43.185 --> 00:53:46.405
Um, Jackson is gonna come up

832
00:53:46.505 --> 00:53:48.565
and share for a few minutes.

833
00:54:05.615 --> 00:54:07.435
All right, uh, my name's Jackson.

834
00:54:07.775 --> 00:54:09.475
If I had the pleasure of meeting y'all.

835
00:54:09.615 --> 00:54:12.035
Um, I serve here at Henderson as,

836
00:54:12.615 --> 00:54:14.915
or I work in our college ministry, young adults.

837
00:54:15.495 --> 00:54:17.475
Um, so if you're interested in born in any

838
00:54:17.475 --> 00:54:18.595
college students here, let know.

839
00:54:19.135 --> 00:54:23.555
Um, but In our time

840
00:54:23.555 --> 00:54:25.555
of discussion, I kind of wanna model something

841
00:54:25.555 --> 00:54:30.115
after what we do in college ministry every Sunday, uh, right

842
00:54:30.415 --> 00:54:32.075
during the first service, uh,

843
00:54:32.215 --> 00:54:33.835
we have a thing called table talks.

844
00:54:34.175 --> 00:54:35.635
So there's this little discussion,

845
00:54:35.895 --> 00:54:40.115
or sorry, a little teaching, um, that falls by discussion

846
00:54:40.115 --> 00:54:41.635
and a little teaching discussion,

847
00:54:42.075 --> 00:54:43.235
a little teaching discussion.

848
00:54:43.615 --> 00:54:46.715
And I've found that so much more impactful in my life than

849
00:54:46.955 --> 00:54:50.115
carrying what I've learned into my day to day.

850
00:54:50.695 --> 00:54:52.995
And so that's kind of what I want to do for us.

851
00:54:53.175 --> 00:54:55.435
I'm gonna ask you to do something a little bit uncomfortable

852
00:54:55.855 --> 00:54:57.315
and talk to those around you.

853
00:54:58.015 --> 00:55:02.155
Um, so I've prepared five questions, um, to kind

854
00:55:02.155 --> 00:55:04.555
of help lead that time, lead that discussion for you.

855
00:55:05.015 --> 00:55:07.835
Um, you by no means have to go off of these, I don't want

856
00:55:07.835 --> 00:55:08.835
to limit you in any way,

857
00:55:08.895 --> 00:55:10.715
but if you like, shoot, I don't know where to start.

858
00:55:10.985 --> 00:55:15.115
This is what this is for. I'll try to find up here.

859
00:55:15.375 --> 00:55:19.515
But, um, Paul, I love this idea

860
00:55:19.535 --> 00:55:21.395
of being created in the image of God.

861
00:55:21.435 --> 00:55:23.035
I think it's something super practical

862
00:55:23.425 --> 00:55:25.555
that we can take in our day to day lives.

863
00:55:26.015 --> 00:55:28.275
So a couple questions, stuff to think about.

864
00:55:28.305 --> 00:55:31.435
Talk about Is, do your commitments

865
00:55:31.575 --> 00:55:35.635
and goals align with God's purpose for your life?

866
00:55:36.505 --> 00:55:39.755
Does this idea, does learning that you were created

867
00:55:39.815 --> 00:55:44.035
for God's glory, does that change the way you view your life

868
00:55:44.035 --> 00:55:46.235
or how you're using your life right now?

869
00:55:47.575 --> 00:55:51.915
How do you represent God's character in your everyday life?

870
00:55:52.185 --> 00:55:53.955
What are you currently doing right now

871
00:55:54.065 --> 00:55:56.395
that showcases God's care to God's attributes?

872
00:55:58.455 --> 00:56:01.675
How do you know and enjoy God personally?

873
00:56:02.055 --> 00:56:03.995
Is that something you're doing right now?

874
00:56:04.215 --> 00:56:06.315
And in what ways are you doing that?

875
00:56:07.935 --> 00:56:10.475
Trevor kind of talked about this earlier, but how,

876
00:56:11.175 --> 00:56:13.595
or sorry, how does being made in the image

877
00:56:13.595 --> 00:56:15.915
of God change the way you view others?

878
00:56:17.575 --> 00:56:18.795
We talked about a little bit already.

879
00:56:18.855 --> 00:56:22.035
How does that change the way you view unbelievers?

880
00:56:23.785 --> 00:56:26.965
And then lastly, I think Mark into this question as well, is

881
00:56:26.995 --> 00:56:29.005
what does the creation of man

882
00:56:29.545 --> 00:56:31.685
the reveal about God's character, what does

883
00:56:31.685 --> 00:56:33.525
that teach you about who God means?

884
00:56:34.625 --> 00:56:37.005
So let's take a couple moments, maybe groups

885
00:56:37.025 --> 00:56:38.445
of three to four.

886
00:56:39.675 --> 00:56:41.325
I'll come back up here and we'll talk about it.

887
00:56:57.395 --> 00:56:57.885
There's

888
00:56:57.885 --> 00:56:58.085
One,

889
00:57:07.025 --> 00:57:08.405
you join us

890
00:57:24.385 --> 00:57:24.805
so dark.

891
00:57:50.305 --> 00:57:53.965
Are you enjoying? Do you

892
01:00:04.385 --> 01:00:04.845
go anywhere?

893
01:00:38.525 --> 01:00:39.045
I mean, what

894
01:00:53.855 --> 01:00:56.845
being in like in it

895
01:00:57.835 --> 01:00:59.685
with him, looking for it.

896
01:00:59.985 --> 01:01:00.405
Listen,

897
01:01:06.435 --> 01:01:10.085
looking for how he,

898
01:06:19.925 --> 01:06:22.365
I hate to interrupt any conversations.

899
01:06:23.665 --> 01:06:25.605
Always my least favorite part on Sundays.

900
01:06:25.605 --> 01:06:27.885
Okay, there's a lot.

901
01:06:31.585 --> 01:06:33.485
Before I hand Things over to Mark really quick,

902
01:06:33.685 --> 01:06:36.325
I just am curious, I want to hear from maybe a couple

903
01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:39.285
Different people, um, kind of

904
01:06:39.285 --> 01:06:40.525
what your group talked about.

905
01:06:40.595 --> 01:06:42.725
What discussed, what were some common things

906
01:06:42.725 --> 01:06:44.245
That might have Popped up?

907
01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:51.685
Oh, share.

908
01:06:55.765 --> 01:06:59.765
I think on the goals, I don't think we all have the same

909
01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:04.245
goals, have some goals.

910
01:07:06.245 --> 01:07:10.725
I I just don't think we at all

911
01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:14.405
agree on what, what they are

912
01:07:25.935 --> 01:07:26.285
About

913
01:07:30.945 --> 01:07:34.045
the general lecture of these questions about, you know,

914
01:07:34.045 --> 01:07:37.365
us sharing our likeness with the world.

915
01:07:37.385 --> 01:07:39.165
You know, we say this church often

916
01:07:39.165 --> 01:07:40.605
that we love God and we love the people.

917
01:07:41.915 --> 01:07:43.885
When we got into discussion about in this world,

918
01:07:43.945 --> 01:07:45.005
it staying the sin

919
01:07:45.145 --> 01:07:49.445
and a lot of the world doesn't follow God's eternal plan.

920
01:07:49.705 --> 01:07:53.685
Uh, as, as Christians, how do we reflect that in a world

921
01:07:53.685 --> 01:07:57.965
that has rules sometimes of completely talent to God

922
01:07:59.105 --> 01:08:01.365
and you know, sometimes can get in trouble, uh,

923
01:08:02.465 --> 01:08:04.525
in workplace, uh, we just talked about

924
01:08:04.665 --> 01:08:08.365
how we have opportunities to do that at times, uh,

925
01:08:08.905 --> 01:08:11.765
and still respect everybody's, uh,

926
01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:14.125
walk, whatever that may be.

927
01:08:15.145 --> 01:08:17.765
And I said, well, what I do is I teach.

928
01:08:17.905 --> 01:08:19.085
So when I get up

929
01:08:19.085 --> 01:08:21.485
and introduce myself, we all introduce ourselves

930
01:08:21.485 --> 01:08:23.645
to each other as a class, is

931
01:08:23.645 --> 01:08:25.445
to just share what's important to me.

932
01:08:26.665 --> 01:08:28.725
And it's really kind of invitation to what it kids,

933
01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:30.845
I share them what's important to me.

934
01:08:31.555 --> 01:08:34.405
There's an invitation disguised it matter. So

935
01:08:35.465 --> 01:08:38.525
That's kind of one Aspect.

936
01:08:38.545 --> 01:08:39.545
All this,

937
01:08:50.395 --> 01:08:51.725
Knowing God personally

938
01:08:51.745 --> 01:08:55.485
and spending time with him helps line the other things up,

939
01:08:55.935 --> 01:08:59.085
helps us, reflect us in together,

940
01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.685
and it aligns our desires more.

941
01:09:12.825 --> 01:09:15.525
We talked about reflecting an image bearing

942
01:09:16.305 --> 01:09:17.365
and something that Mt.

943
01:09:17.365 --> 01:09:21.125
Wright wrote about, um, was just imagining ourselves

944
01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:23.805
as a mirror, but instead of a mirror hanging on the wall,

945
01:09:23.805 --> 01:09:25.525
think of it as a pitched at 45 degrees.

946
01:09:26.585 --> 01:09:31.525
So God's image reflects on us out in the world.

947
01:09:32.185 --> 01:09:34.965
So we reflect his character, his love, his racist mercy,

948
01:09:35.025 --> 01:09:37.525
his truth, and everything else like that 45 degree angle.

949
01:09:37.585 --> 01:09:39.205
And then vice versa. It's a two-way street.

950
01:09:39.585 --> 01:09:43.285
We reflect back to God, praise, adoration,

951
01:09:43.285 --> 01:09:44.765
thanksgiving and glory.

952
01:09:44.825 --> 01:09:49.125
And so that reflection is running both directions off

953
01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:50.645
that mirror visually.

954
01:09:52.565 --> 01:09:54.985
We want be diligent to, with the spirit's help keep

955
01:09:54.985 --> 01:09:57.425
that mirror a good reflection.

956
01:09:57.965 --> 01:10:00.905
So when it's staying with sin, let's confess it

957
01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:02.625
and clean that up and,

958
01:10:02.885 --> 01:10:06.065
and try to be that, uh, with the spirit's,

959
01:10:06.065 --> 01:10:07.105
help that reflection out.

960
01:10:11.325 --> 01:10:13.945
That's a good mark.

961
01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:17.345
That's all I job.

962
01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:35.745
Excuse me while I check Facebook.

963
01:10:38.855 --> 01:10:43.785
Just kidding. Yeah. Thanks guys. That was great. Um,

964
01:10:51.645 --> 01:10:55.505
so, um, you know, I've been looking ahead

965
01:10:55.805 --> 01:11:00.625
for the class next semester. Hey, you can do the

966
01:11:00.865 --> 01:11:01.865
Bathroom here.

967
01:11:08.245 --> 01:11:09.185
We, y'all want to try,

968
01:11:14.075 --> 01:11:16.565
Well it project to the bathroom, I guess.

969
01:11:17.545 --> 01:11:19.685
Anyway, I'm out of time.

970
01:11:20.225 --> 01:11:23.765
Um, so looking ahead to the class next semester,

971
01:11:23.815 --> 01:11:25.205
we've got systematic part two.

972
01:11:26.355 --> 01:11:28.685
Part of what we'll do is the doctrine of salvation.

973
01:11:29.755 --> 01:11:32.375
And so in that we're talking about how God

974
01:11:33.365 --> 01:11:37.575
rescues us in Christ from our broken,

975
01:11:38.115 --> 01:11:39.895
fallen image, right?

976
01:11:40.315 --> 01:11:44.455
Our simple nature. We are rescued by God in spite of that.

977
01:11:45.035 --> 01:11:47.175
But then a part of it, a part of that is understanding.

978
01:11:47.835 --> 01:11:50.215
Uh, what we'll also study then is the idea

979
01:11:50.215 --> 01:11:51.255
of sanctification.

980
01:11:52.005 --> 01:11:55.095
That is the idea of the work of God

981
01:11:55.515 --> 01:11:58.015
and his grace in our lives by the power of the Holy Spirit

982
01:11:58.895 --> 01:12:01.015
changing us to make us more like what?

983
01:12:03.805 --> 01:12:06.655
More like I'm open

984
01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:09.215
to suggestions what Christ.

985
01:12:09.755 --> 01:12:13.295
Christ, right? Who, who is the image of God?

986
01:12:14.595 --> 01:12:18.615
And so the idea of God's work of grace in our lives is he,

987
01:12:18.765 --> 01:12:22.655
he's making us more and more like the original imageable.

988
01:12:22.915 --> 01:12:26.095
We won't meet that in this life fully, you know?

989
01:12:26.095 --> 01:12:27.615
But there is a process of,

990
01:12:28.035 --> 01:12:30.735
of restoring the ruins, if you will.

991
01:12:30.835 --> 01:12:35.135
And so, but the idea that Christ being that the perfect man,

992
01:12:35.275 --> 01:12:36.295
the perfect image

993
01:12:36.295 --> 01:12:38.655
of God we're made in the image and likeness of God.

994
01:12:39.035 --> 01:12:41.775
But the Bible says that the Lord Jesus was made that he,

995
01:12:41.835 --> 01:12:45.775
he is you wanna make, he is the image of God, right?

996
01:12:46.515 --> 01:12:49.335
And, uh, so anyway, as I was thinking about these things

997
01:12:49.355 --> 01:12:52.295
and I was thinking about a song that we might sing together

998
01:12:52.515 --> 01:12:55.495
to conclude, I I really couldn't find a good one

999
01:12:55.495 --> 01:12:58.295
that has sang about the image of God in man.

1000
01:12:58.475 --> 01:13:02.735
But I thought the whole point of the image of God in man

1001
01:13:03.355 --> 01:13:07.015
and mankind is, is that it reflects the goodness

1002
01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:09.215
and the glory and the greatness of God.

1003
01:13:09.275 --> 01:13:11.335
So, uh, I just want to sing this song.

1004
01:13:11.455 --> 01:13:12.655
I don't know if you would all know it.

1005
01:13:13.035 --> 01:13:17.775
Uh, it's by Fernando Ortega. It's, um, our great God.

1006
01:13:18.005 --> 01:13:21.255
Sure. So let's, uh, you would stand

1007
01:13:22.075 --> 01:13:23.495
and together

1008
01:15:04.425 --> 01:15:04.645
And

1009
01:15:32.025 --> 01:15:32.245
our,

1010
01:15:37.345 --> 01:15:41.405
And Rock

1011
01:16:42.795 --> 01:16:43.015
and

1012
01:16:53.955 --> 01:16:54.175
All,

1013
01:18:08.065 --> 01:18:09.065
All right.

1014
01:18:09.585 --> 01:18:12.165
You may be dismissed and you are upset

1015
01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:20.165
Every time.
