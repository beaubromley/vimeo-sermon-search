1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.600
We are going to do tonight in its

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.100
entirety and that's that's week. Six. Okay, this was supposed to

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.100
be last week's.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.800
And we had two more weeks.

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.300
Remember as we go through this flow.

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.900
We had two more weeks which we were going to devote to translation. Okay

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.300
our last step in this process. So what

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.300
we're going to do is we are going to take those

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
two weeks and we're gonna combine them into one but we're

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.500
gonna miss and we're gonna skip a lot of stuff next

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.600
week, so we're not going to talk about the translations

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.800
into other languages.

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.400
We're just going to focus on English Okay, so next

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.700
week.

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.000
Thankfully, it'll be all in English.

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.200
No more Greek. No more Hebrew all English. Okay, so

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.700
we are going to do that. And if

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.400
you want to know more about the

19
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.400
other translations, it's really a wonderful story.

20
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.500
I think how the Bible was translated into different

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
languages other than our own English was

22
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.000
not God's Divine language, right?

23
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.300
The Originals were Greek and Hebrew and they were translated

24
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.500
into multiple multiple languages all throughout history. It's

25
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.400
a fascinating walk as you

26
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.100
take that Journey Through Time.

27
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
If you want to learn and know more about that, you can

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.100
always go to the website that was

29
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.200
on the syllabus my website and you can

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.300
get week seven stuff download it and look

31
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.100
at it through your leisure.

32
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.200
But we're going to focus on the ending of week 7

33
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.600
and then week 8 stuff next week and that'll conclude.

34
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.700
Our our study. Okay. So let

35
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.200
me open this up on a word of prayer and we're going to dive into tonight. So

36
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.000
God we are just so grateful for you

37
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.500
Lord to bring us out here for another Wednesday. Thank you

38
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.100
for this.

39
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.400
Subset Lord of your great

40
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.200
church Lord, who is here tonight?

41
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.000
Who wants to learn and most importantly to

42
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.800
know you better?

43
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.400
To grow closer to you in their faith.

44
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.100
and father just walk more humbly and

45
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.900
more obedient before you and

46
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.200
It is inspiring it is it is

47
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.400
encouraging Lord to see that and how

48
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.600
you're working in this church.

49
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.300
Fathers continued to do that Lord and we

50
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.100
just ask your blessing on on this evening father. Just give

51
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.500
me the right words to say and Lord. I

52
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.400
pray that it would be edifying to those that are here pray for

53
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.500
Troy and Aaron in the other room to give them strength

54
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.800
and Lord. I pray that you would be blessed

55
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.100
and work mightily in that

56
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.100
room as well in Jesus name. Amen.

57
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.000
Okay, so we've come a long way right we've come a long

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.100
way

59
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.000
We have one more stop in this transmission process

60
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.700
and that'll be this thing up

61
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.400
on the screen.

62
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.400
Called textual criticism I've asked this before.

63
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.000
Who has heard of this before?

64
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.400
Okay, and there's a fair amount of hands going up

65
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000
which is which is pretty impressive because I'll tell

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.200
you.

67
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.300
This is not often taught. It's not

68
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.500
going to be preached from the pulpit.

69
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.700
And it's seldom taught.

70
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.700
to

71
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.400
students of of the Bible

72
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.300
So I love it. This is one of the things

73
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.100
that really drew me in to this whole study was

74
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.500
textual criticism. I'll admit

75
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.300
to you that when I first heard about this and this thing

76
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.800
called textual criticism my first response and reaction was

77
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.100
a little skeptical

78
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.700
Okay.

79
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.700
First of all criticism and Bible to

80
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.100
me always makes me draw back a

81
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.300
little bit.

82
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.500
So is this done by a group of people who are critical?

83
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.900
of the Bible

84
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.800
turns out that's not the case.

85
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.600
But that was my initial reaction to it.

86
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.400
So we're going to go through we're going to learn what it is and we

87
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.600
are going to understand what it

88
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.900
can do.

89
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.900
And then we're going to walk through a little exercise. You

90
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.100
don't have to do the exercise. It's already been

91
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.100
done. But I'm going to show you the results, which I

92
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.600
think was pretty pretty interesting. We did a little exercise in

93
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.500
our community group a few years back and it

94
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.500
Lends itself very nicely to falling into

95
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.300
this chapter of our story. So this is one of

96
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.100
my favorite. If not my favorite of all of these

97
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.800
lessons to teach and hopefully you'll understand why

98
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.200
as we go through

99
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.400
little history. We always have to start out with a little history.

100
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.300
You see in the picture. That is a bust of Homer.

101
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.200
From classical Greek times. He

102
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.100
was an author and textual criticism really has its roots all the way

103
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.300
back in classical Greek.

104
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.200
People in the libraries used to gather manuscripts of

105
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.100
a lot of Homer's works and sift through those

106
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.500
manuscripts and try and put together a reasonable reading

107
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.000
of homers works such

108
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.800
as The Iliad and the Odyssey.

109
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.500
the first

110
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.300
mention of textual criticism as it's applied to

111
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.000
the Bible was a man named theodotus

112
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.200
back in the second century.

113
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.200
Who was excommunicated?

114
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.200
Now he was a heretic as

115
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.400
well. And so that fits but

116
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.200
What he was excommunicated for in addition

117
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.200
to that was his use of logic and grammatical

118
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.800
exegesis and math and

119
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.200
empirical science in his interpretation of the

120
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.700
scriptures.

121
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.400
And the church did not.

122
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.900
necessarily like that

123
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.300
so he was given the boot but

124
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.000
his

125
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.900
methods were picked up.

126
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.100
By later followers who you might have heard of origin Jerome

127
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.100
Augustine.

128
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.400
But one thing we have to understand in addition to some of

129
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.600
the things that we learned in previous weeks that old traditions

130
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.500
Die Hard.

131
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.100
The church is notoriously bad at that.

132
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.600
about

133
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.300
dividing between theology

134
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.800
and things that are taught and ordinated in

135
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.000
the scripture verses Traditions that

136
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.500
the church has picked up over time.

137
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.300
That's been very hard in church history as we study

138
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.400
that.

139
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.800
For the church to recognize that and understand that Traditions

140
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.300
are not.

141
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.500
Something that was ordained necessarily by Jesus or the

142
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.800
apostles.

143
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.000
so textual criticism

144
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.300
What is it?

145
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.400
In yellow print up here. It says

146
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.300
it's concerned with the textual variance in either

147
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.200
manuscripts or printed editions in order to reconstruct a

148
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.700
specific reading of the text.

149
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.800
Now what specific reading would we be interested in reconstructing

150
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.600
for the New Testament?

151
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.100
It'd be the original, okay.

152
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.300
We don't necessarily care at this point what the

153
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.300
New Testament looked like in the year 800 we want

154
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.400
to know what the New Testament really looked like in the very beginning

155
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.900
as it was being written, right because we want

156
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.200
our Bibles today.

157
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.500
To be an accurate representation translation of

158
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.800
that original work.

159
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.700
Okay, that's what we're really going after here.

160
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.000
So textual criticism allows us the

161
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.400
tools.

162
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.800
provides for us the tools

163
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.500
to reconstruct a reading in the reading we want is

164
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.000
the original.

165
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.500
So how do we go about practicing textual

166
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.800
criticism?

167
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.300
Two fundamental criteria. Okay. Remember we

168
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.400
have all these manuscripts and now not last week because we weren't

169
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.200
here but now you got to reach back and remember two weeks ago.

170
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.000
We looked at a whole bunch of manuscripts.

171
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.900
And we saw that there was variant readings.

172
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.400
All the manuscripts did not 100% agree.

173
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.900
With each other. Okay. Remember that?

174
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.100
Well texture criticism deals with that.

175
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.200
Number one the first criteria is we need to choose the reading that

176
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.300
best explains the origin of the others.

177
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.300
Okay, if we find the reading of

178
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.300
the variance out there that best explains the other ones

179
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.700
that must be the original.

180
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.700
Okay, that's the first criteria. The second is.

181
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.500
To decide we have to know that the Reconstruction of

182
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.500
the history of a variant reading is prerequisite to forming

183
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.300
a judgment about it. We're going to choose. Is it reading

184
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.200
a or reading B?

185
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.400
Which one gave rise to the other?

186
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.600
And if we can explain how this one B was

187
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.300
derived from a then we feel

188
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.800
much more confident that a was the original.

189
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.500
Okay, and we're going to see that played out in the exercises.

190
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.400
We have two types of evidence. Okay, we have two types

191
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.600
of evidence that we have at our disposal.

192
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.900
Okay, the data points. Okay, textual criticism

193
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.200
is a science. So to do science we need

194
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.700
data we use data. So we have external and

195
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.300
internal evidence external evidence deals with the

196
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.300
manuscript itself.

197
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.900
And what is its date? That's a very important piece of

198
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.000
data.

199
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.300
And what is its geographical distribution? We

200
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.500
talked about that a little bit, but we're really going to hit that.

201
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.400
here in a couple slides

202
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.600
Okay, and then the internal evidence deals with the work

203
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.200
itself?

204
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.000
Okay, we're going to look for things like.

205
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.200
If we have a variant that's in discussion here

206
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.200
or maybe in dispute does a variant rating actually

207
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.400
sound like something that this author.

208
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:09.800
right

209
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.600
Does it sound like Mark?

210
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.500
Okay, we talked about one of the top three.

211
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.800
Areas of the New Testament that has been disputed as

212
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.800
to its authenticity was the ending of Mark.

213
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.300
right Mark chapter 16 and verses 9

214
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.100
through 20

215
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.100
Okay, and when we read those 12 verses we see

216
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.200
that there's vocab that

217
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.500
there's language there's grammar in there that does not.

218
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.900
Sound like the mark.

219
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.500
that we know that wrote the first

220
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.600
16 and a half chapters

221
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.700
Okay, or 15 and a half chapters?

222
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.800
So we're looking for Clues externally and internally

223
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.300
in order to do this.

224
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.400
process or the study of textual criticism

225
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.200
So let's go back and we now we need to understand a little

226
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.600
bit about history and geography to understand why we have these variations

227
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.600
in I mentioned geography. It's a

228
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.300
very very important subject. So let's talk

229
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.400
a little bit we go all the way back to the beginning and Jesus

230
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.300
gives us the Great Commission. He tells us to go into

231
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:19.600
all the world.

232
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.500
Right Make Disciples of all Nations. He says

233
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.100
well.

234
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.500
Good thing for the church. He actually made that

235
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.000
possible on day one.

236
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.000
Right the church did not go out.

237
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.400
God brought people to the church on day

238
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.700
one right? Remember the the Pentecost.

239
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.900
Have Acts chapter 2.

240
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.700
So we have people coming to Jerusalem from all

241
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.200
of these nations that you

242
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.500
see up on the board.

243
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.600
And if you fast forward a little bit.

244
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600
further into time

245
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.200
by the middle of the first century the area in

246
00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.800
green.

247
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.300
These arrows that are green were all of those people

248
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.000
from Pentecost. They took the gospel with them to their Homeland, but

249
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.900
now the disciples are starting to go out.

250
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.800
Right and they occupy a lot of this area in turkey

251
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.200
and Greece and you see Rome most of that

252
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.200
was Paul, right? So you see the church starting to

253
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.400
go out. And so we have this idea this fundamental concept.

254
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.100
I brought it up a couple of weeks ago that the church

255
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.400
is a four-dimensional organism.

256
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.700
Right, it occupies space in the three dimensions.

257
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.600
but differently

258
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.800
in different

259
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.400
points of time in history

260
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.600
Okay, and that's that fourth dimension is time.

261
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.600
Will really see that in a map.

262
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:43.700
like this

263
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.000
so up on the screen we have purple.

264
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.300
Right in here a little bits of North Africa.

265
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.200
That's what the church looked like in its extent

266
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.000
by about the end of the second century.

267
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.300
Green is the other color on here. And this is the extent of

268
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:00.600
the church.

269
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.000
by the middle of the fourth century

270
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.800
Okay, you see it occupying different places at

271
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.700
different times.

272
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.400
If we fast forward a little bit more by the end of

273
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.200
the first millennium.

274
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.700
We see that now some of that has shrunk.

275
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.100
The church was not expanding like it did in

276
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.200
the first few centuries, but rather with the rise of

277
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.000
Islam in the seventh to the 10th centuries.

278
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.600
much of this area in the East and the South

279
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.400
had been taken back and is now

280
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.700
occupied and controlled by

281
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:36.800
Muslims

282
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.100
Okay, so the church is four-dimensional occupies different

283
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.300
places at different times. That is

284
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.200
a fundamental concept which I want everybody to walk

285
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.100
away with because it's really going to help us understand why we

286
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.400
need to do texture criticism and how

287
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.300
we handle it in the process.

288
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.300
Staying with this subject of time and space.

289
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.800
Up on the screen now is a map of the

290
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.200
circum Mediterranean area.

291
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.300
And the different types of manuscripts are

292
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.300
in this box and we talked about those two weeks ago. Okay.

293
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.700
I hope you remember, but we're going to bring it back now.

294
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.300
These are the four types of manuscripts. We have of the

295
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.900
New Testament Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. We

296
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.500
have the papyri. We have the magic schools minuscules and

297
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.200
lectionaries.

298
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.800
We showed you examples of those a couple weeks ago, but now

299
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.400
here are the date ranges.

300
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.300
Of each of those. Okay, so just bringing this

301
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.900
back from two weeks ago, but also

302
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.000
on this map

303
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.300
We see the different text types.

304
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.700
Maybe some of you have heard these names before and we certainly have brought

305
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.200
them up over the last couple of weeks. But now we're going to

306
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.400
actually Define them.

307
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.800
Okay, we have the Western text which

308
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.100
as you might have guessed is in the

309
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.400
western part of the church. That's why it's called the Western

310
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.500
text, but you can see the age ranges.

311
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.800
Of the western text type third about third

312
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.700
of the sixth centuries.

313
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:14.900
alexandrian

314
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.300
which is localized around Alexandria in

315
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.000
Northern Egypt on the Nile Delta.

316
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.800
Is the oldest text type that we have?

317
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.200
and then last but

318
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.100
certainly not least is the Byzantine text.

319
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.800
This is the text. That was later.

320
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:36.500
which was

321
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.900
found distributed in the smaller area of

322
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.100
the Byzantine Empire.

323
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.400
At the beginning of the second Millennium. Okay about the tenth of

324
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.000
the 15th centuries.

325
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.800
I say certainly not least because those are the majority of

326
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.200
our manuscripts right. Do you remember that

327
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.200
from a couple weeks ago the younger manuscripts the

328
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.700
10th to the 15th century?

329
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.700
Are the most abundant?

330
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.600
in our database

331
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.500
Okay, and those most of which we would

332
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.400
characterize as Byzantine in its text

333
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:11.900
type?

334
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.000
Now what all these types mean?

335
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.300
Okay quickly through these alexandrian I said before was

336
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.000
the oldest text. It's the earliest text.

337
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.400
We know it from the manuscripts that have been found around

338
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.000
Alexandria in Egypt.

339
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.500
It's known for its short terse rough

340
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.800
less harmonized readings. Well,

341
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.000
that doesn't sound good. Does it?

342
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.300
Except when you're interested in textual criticism. We

343
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.000
understand that usually

344
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.400
The short terse rough less harmonized readings are

345
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.700
the original ones.

346
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.200
People over time have tended to smooth out

347
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.600
a lot of those rough edges.

348
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.200
The alexandrian text you see in point D

349
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.900
here underlies most Modern English

350
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.500
New Testaments.

351
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.400
Most likely the New Testament that you're reading in

352
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.000
your Bible.

353
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.500
has been taken from and is a translation of

354
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.700
For the most part generally speaking the alexandrian text

355
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.700
unless you have a new King James, okay.

356
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.200
the Western text

357
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.400
Again, it's a very old textural tradition. You

358
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.400
see it's in the third to the sixth Century. That's fairly early church,

359
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.000
right?

360
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.400
But geographically speaking, even though it

361
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.500
is fairly diverse. It is the most diverse geographically speaking.

362
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.600
largely largely confined to the western part

363
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.000
of Europe

364
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.400
Okay, the western part of the church. That's why it's

365
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.200
called the Western text.

366
00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.200
It is found in some Greek manuscripts, but

367
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.400
it is largely known for underlying the

368
00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.800
Latin tradition.

369
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.800
Of the New Testament, okay.

370
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.300
We're not going to talk much about the Latin text. That's what

371
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.000
we have to cut out.

372
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.200
but the Latin text

373
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.900
Is is very old?

374
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.500
Okay, it was translated in about the

375
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.500
second century into Latin.

376
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:19.600
and

377
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.200
largely still used in much of the Roman Catholic church

378
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.200
today. Okay. So the Latin tradition is

379
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.800
a very long-standing and influential and

380
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.500
important tradition.

381
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.000
The Byzantine text. Okay. We've already kind of

382
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.000
talked about that. It is the majority of our manuscripts.

383
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.200
have this Byzantine text type okay over 80% of our

384
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.200
manuscripts dominant in the Byzantine Empire and it

385
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.200
underlies

386
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.900
what we talked about

387
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.400
three weeks ago

388
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.600
and we called the Texas receptus. Okay. Those

389
00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.300
were those early harassments stefanus

390
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.100
Visa elsivir.

391
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.500
Those guys when they made out their their additions

392
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.200
of the Greek New

393
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:08.500
Testament.

394
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.800
We now come to know their new testament texts as

395
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.500
the textus receptus.

396
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.300
But all they had at their disposal at their

397
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.200
time were these Byzantine manuscripts? Okay,

398
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.600
and it is this textus receptus, which

399
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.600
is used in it was used by the translators of

400
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.200
the King James.

401
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.900
Talk about that next week.

402
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.400
A really I think a helpful diagram to really

403
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.600
help bring this all into into play and understanding why

404
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.300
we have these different texts in different places. And why

405
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.700
do they come and go at certain times in history?

406
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.200
Here we have a chart which shows in the

407
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.000
black boxes.

408
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.500
all the manuscripts

409
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.100
from the different Traditions a for

410
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.200
alexandrian West W for Western m

411
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.700
for majority text but

412
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.800
it is the Byzantine text. Okay, some

413
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.300
people call it the majority text. They're slight differences,

414
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.400
but for our purposes, they're the same thing.

415
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.100
There is a TR appear for textus receptus this

416
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.100
big balloon of manuscripts as

417
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.400
we go from time, which marches upward.

418
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.400
in the later centuries

419
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.300
Are all of these Byzantine manuscripts? Okay, but now

420
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.400
we have the three geographic regions.

421
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.700
Let's see what happens as we March through time. Well

422
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.400
starting with the alexandrian texts.

423
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.000
We have the Muslim Conquest. Okay, Alexandria

424
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.200
is in Egypt Egypt. Today is a Muslim Nation.

425
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.600
That happened a long time ago actually, so when

426
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.400
the Muslims came in and took over.

427
00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:49.900
Of course.

428
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.900
the copying of the New Testament drastically dwindled

429
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.900
In Egypt, okay, so that's why the alexandrian

430
00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.800
textual tradition.

431
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.600
died out

432
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.500
When and where it did?

433
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.100
As we go on and we look at the Western. The Western does not

434
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.300
have a lot of manuscript evidence again. I tell you it's

435
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.700
mostly in the Latin but what happened to the western part of

436
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.000
Europe we talked about this a number of weeks ago.

437
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.200
The understanding and the speaking and the reading of Greek it

438
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.900
died out.

439
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.900
Right. That was a major major thing when the Roman Empire split and

440
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.600
the western part of Europe no longer spoke Greek

441
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.300
after that point it became thoroughly latinized.

442
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.100
So when they stopped speaking Greek in the

443
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.000
western part of Europe.

444
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.200
they stopped having a reason to

445
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.300
copy Greek manuscripts in the western part

446
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.400
of Europe. So that tradition dies out at that point.

447
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:48.800
and

448
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.300
the eastern part of Europe thrives for

449
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.600
the next eight or nine hundred years

450
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.900
And so we get this.

451
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.400
Just acceleration and proficiency

452
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.600
of copying Greek manuscripts in

453
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.900
the Middle Ages in the eastern part of the Empire. So

454
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.800
Greece and Turkey, but it dies out

455
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.000
when the Muslims come in and invade Constantinople

456
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.000
in the middle of the 15th century.

457
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.200
And then also the printing press.

458
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.800
so once you have a printing press

459
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.400
You stop having a need for people to handwrite things.

460
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.800
Right? And so that helps us understand why

461
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.100
and where?

462
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.200
The Byzantine or the majority textual tradition dies out

463
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:34.900
as well.

464
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.300
So we talk about variations and now we're going to spend some time

465
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.000
talking about the variance. Okay, we know they're there.

466
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.900
We've seen a couple.

467
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.900
Now let's begin to categorize them so we can work through

468
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.000
all of the variants through this process okay

469
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.300
of textual tradition or textual criticism.

470
00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.200
There's only two types of variance at a very high

471
00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.300
level.

472
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.900
unintentional and intentional

473
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.200
yeah.

474
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.700
That's pretty pretty underwhelming of a categorization, right?

475
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.400
You probably could have guessed that. Yes, there are

476
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.300
intentional changes to the

477
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:15.700
text.

478
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.000
Okay, that's just something that we have to come to grips with.

479
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.200
We have to understand that. It's a fact that that has happened in the

480
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.300
history of the transmission of the

481
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:26.600
Bible.

482
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.800
But now we're going to find out how we deal with that. Okay. So when

483
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.300
we talk about unintentional there's lots of

484
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.200
ways that you can make mistakes. Okay, and those are

485
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.200
listed here. We're not going to go through them for time. We're actually going to see them

486
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.000
unfold as we get into our exercise.

487
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.300
But why would somebody intentionally change the Bible?

488
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.200
Why would somebody intentionally change the word of God?

489
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.100
Do they not have the reverence for it that you

490
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:54.800
and I do?

491
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.800
Of course, we can't speak to their hearts individually.

492
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.500
But one of the things we also have to understand is that they can

493
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.300
display a reverence for the Bible every bit as

494
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.800
much as you and I can today.

495
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.200
By treating it differently than how we would treat it.

496
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.300
We think an old manuscript is Untouchable. You

497
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.100
got to preserve it in a glass case never touch it.

498
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.200
Don't breathe around it.

499
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:26.600
but

500
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.100
much of the people throughout history were let's say

501
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.200
much more Hands-On.

502
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.300
They had reverence for it, but their reverence shows

503
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.700
up in different ways.

504
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.900
If they see a spelling mistake, they're going to fix it.

505
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.400
Because it's God's word. It should be correct.

506
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.800
If there's a portion of the Bible in one

507
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.700
gospel that shows up differently in another gospel. They're

508
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.600
going to harmonize it.

509
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.900
Because it's God's word and it should be harmonized. Okay

510
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.300
that shows reverence.

511
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.700
But from our standpoint and for this exercise they have tampered

512
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.300
with the text.

513
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.700
There was no ill will.

514
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.100
in this

515
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.500
there was there was no.

516
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.100
Devious deceit going here that I'm going

517
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.400
to make new doctrines. I'm going to say Jesus really didn't rise from

518
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.400
the dead and start my own belief system. There's not none

519
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:19.700
of that.

520
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.000
Going on.

521
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.300
Clearing up some geographical and historical difficulties.

522
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.600
Additions of other details. Okay. These

523
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.300
are all examples that are

524
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.800
well known and well documented in the manuscripts.

525
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.900
intentional changes

526
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.600
But we need to understand what that means.

527
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.900
And not go running wild saying that people changed Christianity.

528
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.500
They didn't change Christianity.

529
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.700
From their point of view they were making it more understandable.

530
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.800
Okay, but from our point of view they have corrupted the

531
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.200
text and if we're trying to get back to the

532
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.100
original text, we have to see through that.

533
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.200
Okay, and textual criticism allows us the ability in the

534
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200
tools to be able to do that.

535
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.200
my favorite

536
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.300
variant of all time is this one

537
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.300
on the screen. Okay, it is from

538
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.000
a 14th century minuscule

539
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.000
Okay, the small cursive letters.

540
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.200
And it's taken from The Book of Luke remember in

541
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.400
Luke. There's a genealogy of Jesus right and Luke chapter

542
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:31.500
3.

543
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.300
Familiar with that. Well, I have underlined in

544
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.000
red here.

545
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.200
Are variant of interest and I'm going to translate it for

546
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.300
you as we go through the genealogy follow along see if

547
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.100
this makes sense Seth.

548
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.600
the son of nation the son of Adam the son

549
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.700
of a minadab the Son of God the son

550
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.300
of Aram the son of hezron the

551
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.200
son of Perez

552
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.000
Anything sound off?

553
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.500
You did not know that the creator of the heavens in the Earth was named

554
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.500
Perez.

555
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.500
Did you?

556
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.200
And why is God in the middle of a genealogy?

557
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.800
Is that sound a little off to you?

558
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.800
Okay, so is this scribe a

559
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.500
heretic?

560
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.500
Is this scribe trying to create his own

561
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.100
belief system? Well

562
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.900
textual criticism allows us the tools to understand

563
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.300
this.

564
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.400
In a lot of the manuscripts there's different ways describes what

565
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.200
handle genealogies. Sometimes they would write them

566
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.400
out in paragraph form, which we just saw. Sometimes they

567
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.600
would put them in columns.

568
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.300
and sometimes

569
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.600
Two ways. You can write them in columns as one where the columns go from

570
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.300
top down go over top down go

571
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.500
over top down or you can read and ping

572
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.300
pong back and forth in the columns.

573
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.200
Well the Scribe we can deduce.

574
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.300
Was looking at a manuscript and copying from a manuscript that had

575
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.200
the genealogies in two columns.

576
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.000
like this

577
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:13.600
which

578
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.400
The Scribe of the original document put them

579
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.900
in columns top-down top-down but describe

580
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.200
who was copying it

581
00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.100
Took that to read.

582
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.300
Left right left right left, right and before

583
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.200
you know it you get all the names.

584
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.700
out of order

585
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.800
because they should have been red top down. He read them left, right?

586
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.600
And you end up with the manuscript that we

587
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.600
just showed so now this just

588
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.500
becomes a laughable.

589
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.100
Curiosity, right? It's no big

590
00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:48.200
deal.

591
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:49.700
It's a

592
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.500
what we're about to see in this diagram here.

593
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.600
It is a meaningful.

594
00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.400
variation

595
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.600
But it's not possible.

596
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.400
It's not viable.

597
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.000
So Dr. Dan Wallace, we talked about him before he

598
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.500
created this document or somebody created

599
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.700
it from listening to him.

600
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.200
And we talk about these variants, right? And how many

601
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.400
did we say that there are in the New Testament?

602
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.300
I don't believe that we did.

603
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.400
So I'm gonna tell you now.

604
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.300
back in 1700

605
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.100
John Mill we talked about him two weeks ago.

606
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.300
Came to the realization as he's counting

607
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.200
them up from his 100 manuscripts that there he kind

608
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.200
of 30,000 variations in the

609
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.700
New Testament.

610
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.200
That was back in 1700.

611
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.300
300 years later

612
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.500
5800 manuscripts later

613
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.300
the estimate now is somewhere on the order of

614
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.700
300 to 400,000.

615
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.200
variations in the New Testament

616
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.600
We need to understand that number.

617
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.200
And we need to understand how that number should make

618
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.800
us feel.

619
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.000
At first glance it sounds like

620
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:09.500
a big blow.

621
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.000
And granted a lot of people who are antagonistic to

622
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.100
the Bible have come at us saying there's

623
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:20.200
300 to 400,000 variations and

624
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.800
all these manuscripts. How can you trust?

625
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.100
your Bible

626
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.700
We hear that a lot. But now let's categorize these

627
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.000
variants. Okay?

628
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.800
75% of them are spelling errors.

629
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.600
19% of the rest

630
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:41.000
are

631
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.200
untranslatable

632
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.500
meaning you and I will never know it because it

633
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.500
does not affect the translation one bit.

634
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.200
It's hidden.

635
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.800
in there

636
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.900
In other words, you can't physically bring it into translation. Let's

637
00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.700
put it that way.

638
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.100
That's 90. That's 94%

639
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.400
of all the variants

640
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.900
Are either spelling mistakes or not translatable? What

641
00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.400
about the rest?

642
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.300
5% are meaningful variants, but

643
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.000
they're not possible that one that we just looked at in the last

644
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.500
slide with Luke's genealogy. That's a meaningful one. Right if we

645
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.100
were to understand that meaning that would change a lot

646
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:23.400
of stuff.

647
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.900
But we know that it's not viable. It's just not possible. We understand

648
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.200
how that mistake had been made.

649
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.500
1%

650
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.600
Is All That Remains and those are the meaningful and

651
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.200
possible?

652
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.600
Variance but one of the things we need to understand about that 1% Now,

653
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.400
we're down we're not three or four hundred thousand now, we're down to three or

654
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.100
four thousand that's still a lot but one of

655
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.700
the things we need to understand about that number.

656
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.600
and this category

657
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.900
Is that while they are meaningful and possible they none

658
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.000
of them?

659
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.200
affect any Doctrine

660
00:31:59.200 --> 00:31:59.900
of Christianity

661
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.000
Okay, they're minor in their significance.

662
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.900
they might be meaningful to alter the the possible meaning

663
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.700
of a text, but they're insignificant to

664
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.600
what you and I believe

665
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.600
Okay, so that helps us then really narrow

666
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.300
the number down and with that we're going

667
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.200
to understand how some of these mistakes are made.

668
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.100
So I'm going to take you you're not all now honorary members of our

669
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:27.900
community group.

670
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.300
Okay, and we're going to go back to the year

671
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.200
2017.

672
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.300
All the way back was that five years.

673
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.900
And we did a little exercise.

674
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.500
unbeknownst to everybody in our community group, but me I was

675
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.100
kind of like

676
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.600
a little devious in my methods, but what I

677
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.600
wanted people to do

678
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600
was copy God's word.

679
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.000
Has anybody ever done that taking a chunk of God's word and

680
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.700
copied it?

681
00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.000
I don't mean print it out in word. I mean just take a pen and

682
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.700
a paper and write it out anybody done that like a significant one

683
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.200
not just like Jesus wept.

684
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:06.700
We're talking about.

685
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.500
A book of the Bible or something like that. Well,

686
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.100
that was what I wanted people to do as we

687
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.400
were teaching through some of this stuff and we got to hell.

688
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.900
How scribes actually sit and write out

689
00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:22.300
God's word.

690
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.700
I wanted people to do that for themselves. Okay, and

691
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.100
that's a way to grow close to the Lord.

692
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.000
It's one thing to read his word, but we

693
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.700
pay much more attention when we're reading it and reciting

694
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.400
it and writing it down.

695
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.200
Okay, because that is the methodology here the way the

696
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.400
monks in the Middle Ages would do it is they would actually read a

697
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.200
portion of the scripture.

698
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.600
They would meditate on it memorize it.

699
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.600
And then they would write it down and recite it

700
00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.100
back as their writing it.

701
00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.300
And then go back to the next phrase and do

702
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.500
it repeatedly, imagine copying the entire Bible that

703
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:03.700
way.

704
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.500
How long would that take right?

705
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.800
So that was what I just encouraged people

706
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.800
to do take it in your English Bible that copying

707
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.900
Greek manuscripts. We're just taking in your English Bible and

708
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.300
copy down God's word. And what we're going

709
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.000
to do is start out with a relatively small book Colossians.

710
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:22.900
Okay.

711
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:29.600
Okay.

712
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.400
what I'm going to do when everybody is done,

713
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.400
that is I'm going to take all those manuscripts and

714
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.200
I'm going to

715
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.800
go through them like a textual critic.

716
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.200
Okay, and I did tell people I was going to do that.

717
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.200
But what is my methodology? Well, I'm going to pick one

718
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.900
of the manuscripts that's given to me as a base. I'm

719
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.300
going to go through each manuscript and compare it

720
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.700
to that base manuscript, and I'm going to note every

721
00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.200
variant.

722
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.000
I'm going to look for spelling abbreviations addition

723
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.100
subtractions word orders all of this

724
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:07.500
stuff.

725
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.700
And I'm not going to worry so much about capitalization or punctuation because

726
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.200
those were not real things in the early

727
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:14.900
manuscripts.

728
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.400
And I'm going to tally up all of the different variants.

729
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.200
And then I'm going to show people how well they did as scribes.

730
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.000
But what I'm actually trying to do.

731
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.100
Is not make people feel bad.

732
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.600
What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to restore what it

733
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.500
is that they copied.

734
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.000
And I'm not going to look at what it is that they copied because that's

735
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.500
what a textual critic of the Bible actually does.

736
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.600
We have manuscripts, but we don't have the originals. Right? So

737
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.200
this is an exercise that I tried to do with

738
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.100
just our community group in a small setting.

739
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.100
Trying to mimic what text critics today are trying to

740
00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.300
do with the New Testament.

741
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.600
Okay. I hadn't seen a study like this before.

742
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.500
But I wanted to give it a go.

743
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.000
and you don't need

744
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.400
Turns out this this case we copied the ESV. You don't

745
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.300
need the ESV to be able to restore the text

746
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.200
of the ESV.

747
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.700
That's the conclusion.

748
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.100
That we came to and I'll show you I'll walk you through it.

749
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.400
So now a little bit about the book of Colossians it has four chapters.

750
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.500
It has 95 verses it has 1582 words.

751
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.100
And here are our lucky participants. I took

752
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.800
the names off to protect the innocent or

753
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.700
In this case the very very guilty.

754
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.100
members of our community group

755
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:46.300
Okay.

756
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.600
We have seven manuscripts now. Some people didn't copy the ESV. And

757
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.400
of course, I can't use that one. Right that would be that would

758
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.200
be beyond the scope. But seven people copied the

759
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.500
ESV the entire book of Colossians. Well one person gave

760
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.600
up halfway through chapter one, but that's okay.

761
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.500
I can use that right? We have some manuscripts in

762
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.900
the in the historical record that aren't complete.

763
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.600
If it's got a chapter in it we can use it.

764
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.400
So I used it.

765
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.000
Now the results.

766
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.900
How many variants?

767
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.000
Do you think?

768
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.800
That we had out of seven manuscripts seven participants copying

769
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.700
the book of Colossians.

770
00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.500
How many variants and I mean how many differences between

771
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.200
any of these manuscripts do you think that we had?

772
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.900
Anybody wanted to shout out a guess?

773
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.900
800 that's a lot.

774
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.300
It's a really good guess but it's that that's

775
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.400
a lot. We didn't quite have that many.

776
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.100
We had 95.

777
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.200
Okay, now 800 would have been really impressive that would have

778
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.200
made for a much better lesson, but that would have drove me nuts trying to

779
00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.500
piece together 800 mistakes 95 though

780
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.200
is a lot.

781
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.200
Right. We have 95 verses in the book of

782
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.800
Colossians. That's one perverse.

783
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.800
If you think about it for every verse in Colossians, I

784
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.900
had to analyze an error.

785
00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:14.700
for every verse

786
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.900
and then here are the results.

787
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.100
Of those and we had some people

788
00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.300
were very good at this. Nobody was perfect.

789
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.200
Let's stop and think about that for a brief second.

790
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.900
nobody copied

791
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.100
the ESV

792
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.300
Colossians perfectly without making a mistake. Nobody did

793
00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:38.400
it.

794
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.100
Some people got pretty close.

795
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.000
three and four

796
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.800
this person

797
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.400
who I won't tell you is me.

798
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.600
Had 31 and had the most mistakes.

799
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.100
I was not trying to make mistakes. That's the point

800
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.300
none of us.

801
00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.800
Were trying to make mistakes.

802
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.600
Okay. So what kind of mistakes did we see? Well this

803
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.400
scribe f

804
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.600
started abbreviating cutting corners

805
00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:14.400
little ampersands here for the word and Little W

806
00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.100
slashes for the word with

807
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.600
okay cutting corners.

808
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.800
Right. Those are all variations. Those

809
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.700
are all variants.

810
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.700
Do we see abbreviations in the historical

811
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.500
record we do.

812
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.200
P46 from the second century. It's a

813
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.900
Greek manuscript in the red circles. You see abbreviations.

814
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.100
Kai Omega for Cristo

815
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:41.200
Christ

816
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.900
Divine names we call these nominous chakra.

817
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.000
In the early Church in the early manuscripts, they would

818
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.200
often take the Divine names and they would abbreviate him taking

819
00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.700
the first and the last letter with a little bar on top.

820
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.900
To abbreviate out of reverence and respect the Divine

821
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.300
name. So God Jesus Christ spirit.

822
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.500
And there was a much bigger list too as time went on all those

823
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.300
abbreviations. We know exactly what was intended. They

824
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.100
don't come across in any translation.

825
00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.300
But those are Corruptions.

826
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.400
Those were not original those were done

827
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.400
later. So they are variants and we

828
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.600
have to check those.

829
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.300
And we have to tally those up.

830
00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.600
spelling mistakes

831
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.400
this person spelled trespasses wrong and then

832
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.900
spelled it right in the same verse.

833
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.800
Again, I won't tell you that to me.

834
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.700
That's a mistake. That's a variant.

835
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.700
scribe of f

836
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.800
Be filled with the knowledge of his will in Al spiritual

837
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.500
wisdom. They didn't spell. All right a

838
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.100
l l.

839
00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.400
That's a mistake. That's a variant.

840
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.300
transposition deals with the word order

841
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.500
in Colossians 1:4 the Scribe of H says faith

842
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.600
in Jesus Christ.

843
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.500
Describe of F and all the other ones read faith in

844
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.400
Christ Jesus. Well Christ Jesus and

845
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.800
Jesus Christ are the same person.

846
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.800
But that's a textual corruption.

847
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.000
It's a mistake. It's a variant we have to tally it up.

848
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.500
Does it change the meeting?

849
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.400
No does not change the meaning do we

850
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.300
see this in a historical record? We absolutely do.

851
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.400
p46 again from the second century and 1st

852
00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.400
Corinthians 1:1

853
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.900
says an apostle of Christ Jesus

854
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.500
Well codex cine Atticus in the

855
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.500
fourth Century says an apostle of Jesus Christ. It's the exact

856
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.400
same.

857
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.600
error exact same variant

858
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.300
That our community group unintentionally reproduced.

859
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.300
That is also found in the manuscripts.

860
00:41:59.100 --> 00:41:59.400
Okay.

861
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:01.700
substitution

862
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.900
Food or drink or food and drink?

863
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.300
And an ore not the same word. They do mean different things

864
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.000
but in some context they can be synonymous.

865
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.500
And in this case, it can be synonymous. It's a

866
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.900
substitution. It's a corruption. We have to tally it.

867
00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.200
But it does not change the meaning and only one scribe did

868
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.800
it the other ones were unanimous and saying food

869
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.700
and drink?

870
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.500
Now here's an interesting one.

871
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.300
Colossians 2:13, you might recognize this verse

872
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.200
and you who were raised in your trespasses.

873
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.400
Does that sound right?

874
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.800
I believe it should say you who were dead in your trespasses.

875
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.500
past tense before Christ

876
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.600
Now what kind of heretic in our community group?

877
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.600
Would write you who were raised in your

878
00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.500
trespasses?

879
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.400
Just when I was about to call the Elders and come

880
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:03.900
to a meeting.

881
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.700
We thought about textual criticism and what could they possibly

882
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.000
other than intentionally have done to create

883
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.800
this heresy.

884
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.500
Well, it turns out if you look at the verses before

885
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:17.800
that.

886
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.600
Says you also were also raised with

887
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.300
him through faith in the powerful working of

888
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.200
God who raised him from the dead and you who were

889
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.000
raised in your trespasses.

890
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.300
Raised is on the brain.

891
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.600
Raised as a repeated word.

892
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.200
And our brains can often play tricks on us if

893
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.800
we hear of word over and over and over again, it becomes locked

894
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.400
and we subconsciously put it

895
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.200
in there when the next verb is needed.

896
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.000
Instead of dead, which is correct. It becomes raised.

897
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.100
Okay, so we can reproduce and understand this mistake.

898
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.400
There was no intentional heresy.

899
00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:58.800
at all

900
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.300
omissions to the brothers at Christ

901
00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:07.000
rights e c says the brothers in

902
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.700
Christ at colase.

903
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:10.300
Okay.

904
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.100
Scribe e left out the words in Christ.

905
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.800
Meaningful but not viable, right?

906
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.600
We know that all the other ones got it, right.

907
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.700
And brothers in Christ or just brothers has

908
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:26.800
no difference in meaning.

909
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.900
To us we understand.

910
00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.300
What this mistake is is actually getting at

911
00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.000
it's not a significant difference.

912
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.700
Additions, here's a little addition for all of the Saints.

913
00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.200
And this one and all the others say for all the

914
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.600
saints. So just that word of.

915
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.200
That's all it is.

916
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.800
It does not affect the meaning one

917
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.100
bit.

918
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.300
I'm going to skip a few for time and we're

919
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.300
going to get to some of the good ones.

920
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.900
Actually, I do want to point this one out.

921
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.300
And Alternate for laga. Forlaga is the actual.

922
00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.500
Manuscript that you're copying from. Okay. That's

923
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.600
the one I'm trying to reproduce in this exercise. So

924
00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.300
scribe J.

925
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.900
Inscribe G read differently here.

926
00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.600
Okay Colossians 11.

927
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.200
Jay says being strengthened. Gee says

928
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.200
may you be strengthened those are different verbal conjugations

929
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.500
of the of the verb to strengthen.

930
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.100
Okay, once a participle and one's more of a subjunctive. So

931
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.000
which ones correct? Well, I can't

932
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.100
just go to which scribe was the worst because J and G were the

933
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:41.400
two best.

934
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.200
Here's another instance where you do look at the proficiency

935
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.500
Of The Scribe and the competency Of

936
00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.600
The Scribe these were two of the best and here they disagree.

937
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.000
So what's going on?

938
00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.300
Well, it turns out that we have a bit of a moving Target.

939
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.400
The ESV originally said being

940
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.100
strengthened.

941
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.600
In 2016 the ESV actually changed its

942
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:07.900
wording.

943
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.300
To read may you be strengthened.

944
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.400
Okay, so a moving Target in this

945
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.200
case. Okay, it becomes very difficult and we do have some

946
00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.200
snafus like this.

947
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.400
Which make it very difficult it adds uncertainty to

948
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.100
my job as a text critic when this is going on.

949
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.200
Now, let's talk a little bit about.

950
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.900
These are my favorites haploggraphy. Meaning something

951
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.700
is omitted.

952
00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.400
Okay, and there's a there's a certain process of

953
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.700
how this happens. I'm going to read what scribes see

954
00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.900
right here. And you tell me if this makes sense.

955
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.800
See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy

956
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.500
and empty deceit according to human

957
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.400
tradition according to Christ.

958
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.100
See to it that no one takes you captive according to

959
00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.300
Christ. Why would Paul write that?

960
00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.500
Again, just one. I'm about to call the Elders.

961
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.700
I go through the manuals on textual criticism.

962
00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.600
And there's a very very easy explanation to

963
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:19.800
this.

964
00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.300
Haploggraphy often deals with

965
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.600
going back to reading similar words and losing

966
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.800
your place. Okay haploggraphy means

967
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:31.600
that you go back.

968
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.200
You write the first instance. Sorry you go. You look

969
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.700
at let me get this, right?

970
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.600
Okay, you write down.

971
00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.100
the first word according

972
00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.800
right here, which I'm circling.

973
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.300
You write it down. So you write down the first

974
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.300
occurrence of a word?

975
00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.600
But then when you go back to the page your eye

976
00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.300
goes back to the second occurrence of

977
00:47:59.300 --> 00:47:59.700
the word.

978
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.600
and everything between the first and the second occurrence is

979
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.000
then

980
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.800
Is then omitted?

981
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.400
Okay, so everything in the verse that's

982
00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.600
underlined here described just omitted.

983
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.300
Okay, his eyes went back to a different

984
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.100
spot on the page.

985
00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.800
Which was incorrect and all those words got left out.

986
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.600
Look, here's the word according. He wrote down according,

987
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.200
but when he went back to the page, he looked

988
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.200
at this word according.

989
00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.000
And all the words that are underlined were emitted.

990
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.300
Okay, that's haploggraphy. That's when you go back to a similar word

991
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.400
or a similar ending to a word.

992
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.300
And leave out the stuff in between. Does that happen

993
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.800
in the manuscripts?

994
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.400
It does.

995
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.600
Codex alexandrinus of the fifth century

996
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.700
and First Corinthians 9:2 describe left

997
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.800
out the entire verse.

998
00:48:58.100 --> 00:48:59.200
He omitted all of

999
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.500
nine verse 2

1000
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.200
why because the last four words of verse 1

1001
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.800
and the last four of words of verse 2 are

1002
00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.600
the exactly the same.

1003
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.500
so the Scribe

1004
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.400
went back to the place. He thought was the

1005
00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:20.400
right place, but it was not he went back to the other four

1006
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.400
words and ended up omitting all of verse 2.

1007
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.500
Okay, the Scribe e says sexual

1008
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.000
immorality passion evil desire. We're listing all

1009
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.200
these sins, but they left out impurity.

1010
00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.600
Why because it has the same ending as

1011
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.600
the word right before it the ity.

1012
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.500
And is so easy to go back and see

1013
00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.900
something similar and lose your place. Okay

1014
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.400
the brain.

1015
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.400
Sometimes plays tricks on us.

1016
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.400
Here's another good one.

1017
00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.300
If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of

1018
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:04.100
the world, do you submit to regulations?

1019
00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.200
That's not even a real sentence.

1020
00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:11.200
What's missing what's missing is the

1021
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.300
part of why as if you were still alive in

1022
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.700
the world, do you submit to regulations?

1023
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:21.100
How did this error come about the exact same way? You're right

1024
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.300
down this word world?

1025
00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.700
And your eye goes back to this word world.

1026
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.300
And you leave out everything in between all of

1027
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.200
these omittances of either a word and

1028
00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:36.000
ending of a word or an entire sentence or entire verse.

1029
00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:38.400
Are easily explained?

1030
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.800
By understanding how the mind works.

1031
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.200
And by seeing this repeated over and over again in

1032
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.600
the manuscripts. Now, the opposite of haploggraphy is

1033
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.600
datography. That's where

1034
00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.800
we have a repetition so

1035
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.400
Listen to this.

1036
00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.300
Continue steadfastly in prayer being watchful in

1037
00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.400
it with Thanksgiving at the same time pray also for us that

1038
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.500
God may open to us that God may open to us a

1039
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.700
door for the world.

1040
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.100
to catch that

1041
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.100
how did this happen?

1042
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.300
the word us

1043
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.200
So just like the last instance was you see the

1044
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.200
first occurrence and your mind goes back to the second and you

1045
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.200
leave out stuff here you write the first and the second

1046
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.000
and then your eye goes back to the first again.

1047
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.500
and you rewrite the entire passage in between

1048
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.800
okay, one of our scribes and our community group.

1049
00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.100
Did this without even knowing?

1050
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.600
Does this happen in the manuscripts?

1051
00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.600
Yes, it does.

1052
00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.200
Codex vaticanus are the fourth Century

1053
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.500
in Acts. 1934 says great is Artemis of

1054
00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.100
the Ephesians great is Artemis of the

1055
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:00.600
Ephesians.

1056
00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.000
Why because the endings of the words before and after that?

1057
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.700
Are exactly the same and they've repeated.

1058
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.300
the words

1059
00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.100
now we tally up all of

1060
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:16.700
these variants.

1061
00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.000
I told you there was 95.

1062
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:20.800
How do we then?

1063
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:27.300
Critique this and come to conclusions. Well,

1064
00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:29.400
we got to give these confidence ranges.

1065
00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.600
Okay. This is what the Committees do the actual text

1066
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.600
critics of the New Testament. They will assign all

1067
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.500
of these variences.

1068
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.600
That we see in all the manuscripts different levels of confidence

1069
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.300
and I've kind of mimicked that here if we give it

1070
00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.800
an a that means we're 100% confident in the reading.

1071
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.600
B 75 C50 d25

1072
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.300
Okay in the confidence ranges of whether these are

1073
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.700
could be legitimate or not.

1074
00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.700
Here's what came up with.

1075
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.000
All but two of them.

1076
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.000
Were a hundred percent?

1077
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.700
Because they were easily identified we

1078
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.000
understood that they were not viable. These mistakes

1079
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.800
could be could be explained by.

1080
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.400
Just our knowledge of how the mind works.

1081
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.600
two of them were a little difficult because the

1082
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.100
scribes were

1083
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.600
You know, it just wasn't one. It was two who made

1084
00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.400
the variant and sometimes the two one

1085
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:29.700
of the two.

1086
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.100
Were pretty competent in what else

1087
00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:35.200
they had done so it becomes a little bit more difficult.

1088
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.600
And so I had to give a couple of these a little bit lower confidence.

1089
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.100
But here's what the end result is.

1090
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.200
Out of 95 variants where we have a

1091
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.200
variant of one per verse.

1092
00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.400
in the book of Colossians

1093
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:58.700
The confidence in restoring the original ESV

1094
00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.000
without even looking at it.

1095
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.600
From Seven manuscripts none of which were perfect.

1096
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.300
All of which had errors in

1097
00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:10.000
them was 99.97.

1098
00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.700
That's not bad.

1099
00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.800
when you factor in

1100
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:21.000
that if we would have gone back to these two.

1101
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.300
And said, well the majority of the manuscripts had this one.

1102
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.400
So I'm going to actually choose that to be the original and the

1103
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.900
majority of this had this one to be original and

1104
00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.200
if I would have chosen the majority rules out

1105
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.700
of those it would have been a hundred percent.

1106
00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.900
We would have reconstructed perfectly.

1107
00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.500
the ESV

1108
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:44.600
from

1109
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.900
all imperfect manuscripts

1110
00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.700
Okay. I hope that provides some encouragement.

1111
00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:55.800
because when we take this

1112
00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.700
To the data that we have. We have

1113
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.500
5,800 manuscripts of the New Testament

1114
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.300
in Greek. Not seven 5,800

1115
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.900
Plus all of the other languages plus all of the church fathers, so

1116
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.800
what that's going to do for us.

1117
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.000
it will provide confidence but

1118
00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:20.300
We will also have a lot more than 95 variants,

1119
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.700
right? The reason why we had 95 in

1120
00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.100
our community group was because we had seven think how much

1121
00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:28.200
more we would have had if our community group would

1122
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.800
have had 5,800 people.

1123
00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:33.400
Doing this and none of those would have been perfect either.

1124
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:37.600
Okay. I hope you can see how the number of mistakes and variances just

1125
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.800
going to escalate.

1126
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:40.500
from there

1127
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.300
Now we have 15 minutes left. Actually. This will

1128
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.300
work out pretty good.

1129
00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:52.700
Remember in week one.

1130
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.300
I told you to open your Bibles to acts 8:37

1131
00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.500
and remember that.

1132
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.200
And only a few of you had that verse in

1133
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.900
it. Most of your Bibles didn't have that verse.

1134
00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.600
Okay acts 8:37 is one of the more famous examples

1135
00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.200
of a verse that many people would say is

1136
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.400
missing in your Bible.

1137
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.700
The King James has acts 8:37 the

1138
00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.700
modern translations like your ESV and IV.

1139
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.500
Those do not have that verse so now

1140
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.500
we're actually going to walk through a little

1141
00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:30.800
bit of textual criticism.

1142
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.200
Of our verse so this is no longer an exercise

1143
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.300
in English. Now, we're going to actually see what the deal

1144
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:37.600
is.

1145
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.600
With acts 8:37. Does it

1146
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.200
belong in our Bibles or not? Some Bibles have

1147
00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.500
it some don't who got it, right?

1148
00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.100
And how do we know?

1149
00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.100
Because it's one thing for us to read it in our

1150
00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.800
Bible. See it's missing and just go. Yeah.

1151
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.400
Okay, the footnote down here says it's not in

1152
00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.800
some manuscripts that's good enough for me.

1153
00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.100
Well, that wasn't good enough for me ever.

1154
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.800
I wanted to pursue that understand why is

1155
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.200
it not in some manuscripts? Because we are talking

1156
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.300
about the word of God here.

1157
00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.200
So let's go through it. Let's look at the data you all can

1158
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:13.400
read that.

1159
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.400
Can't read that but I will tell you what it what it

1160
00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:19.500
says.

1161
00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:24.300
This is our database for acts 8:37.

1162
00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.200
Okay, and in the

1163
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.800
white columns so out here and

1164
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.300
down.

1165
00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.700
And when I say down we are starting with the first

1166
00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:38.000
century second third fourth all

1167
00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:40.800
the way down to 15 16

1168
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.500
17th centuries. Okay. So time is

1169
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.000
running down the page.

1170
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.200
So all of these

1171
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:51.700
numbers and letters in these white columns

1172
00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:54.500
represent the database that we have all of

1173
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.100
the witnesses for the New Testament text.

1174
00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.400
that do not have

1175
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.000
acts 8:37 in them.

1176
00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.100
Okay, that's in the white.

1177
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.000
We have here gray a light

1178
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:13.700
gray right here. These are all

1179
00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.400
of the manuscript Witnesses the Greek and

1180
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.000
other languages and church fathers.

1181
00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.200
witnesses that do have the verse

1182
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.700
but not the way that Erasmus and the

1183
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.100
King James have the verse.

1184
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.000
It's a slightly different text.

1185
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.000
And this darker gray out here.

1186
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.500
are all the witnesses that do

1187
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:38.900
have

1188
00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.600
acts 8:37

1189
00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.100
in the correct wording of the King James.

1190
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.200
One of the first things that we notice and you

1191
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.900
don't have to read the numbers to know all of these numbers that

1192
00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.700
are squished together right here in the later centuries.

1193
00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.800
Those are which kind of text.

1194
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:04.600
Byzantine those are Byzantine manuscripts the

1195
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.700
Byzantine textual tradition the mass

1196
00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.200
of manuscripts in the Middle Ages.

1197
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.800
those usually

1198
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.500
agree with the Texas receptus

1199
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.300
and then therefore the King James.

1200
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.100
but in this case

1201
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.400
they don't.

1202
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.400
All of those Mass manuscripts in the Middle Ages do not have

1203
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.400
acts 8:37 in it.

1204
00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:36.100
There are a fair amount of manuscripts that do.

1205
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.600
Have acts 8:37.

1206
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.300
Okay, but we're going to get into that.

1207
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.800
Now is acts 8:37 and important

1208
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:48.400
verse. Well read what it says. Then Philip said

1209
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.300
this is Ethiopian eunuch. And Philip is evangelizing.

1210
00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.800
He wants to get baptized in verse 837 says

1211
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.300
then Philip says if you believe

1212
00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:59.900
with all your heart you may

1213
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.300
And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ

1214
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.100
is the Son of God. Well, at least it's nothing

1215
01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:06.800
important, right?

1216
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.600
Now this is very important.

1217
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.400
It's a testimony of his faith.

1218
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.500
That allows him to get baptized.

1219
01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.200
Why would somebody omit that right and that's

1220
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.200
what we hear a lot. Your Bible doesn't have that in there. It's

1221
01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.600
it's not correct or worse it's satanic.

1222
01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.800
Okay, we've heard that.

1223
01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.400
Let's look at the evidence. We're text critics. Now. Let's actually

1224
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.300
do textual criticism. Let's look at the data. The earliest

1225
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.000
that we see of Acts

1226
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.400
8:37 is from the church father

1227
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.100
irenaeus irenaeus if you've heard

1228
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.600
of that name before maybe you have

1229
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.600
But you might not know where he's from. He's from Leon in

1230
01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.100
France.

1231
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.900
Okay, that's where his church was.

1232
01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:57.900
in modern day, France

1233
01:00:59.300 --> 01:00:59.700
he writes.

1234
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.300
As did also the believing unit himself and

1235
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:06.500
immediately requesting to be baptized. He said I believe Jesus

1236
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.300
Christ to be the Son of God. Well, it sounds a lot like our

1237
01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:09.800
verse right?

1238
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:11.500
right

1239
01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.700
that was taken from about the year 180.

1240
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.200
very old

1241
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:18.900
that's early church.

1242
01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.100
but

1243
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.600
where is irenaeus?

1244
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.800
He's all the way out in the westernmost

1245
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.900
part of the church.

1246
01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.400
We talked about the Western text as being one

1247
01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:35.800
that

1248
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:40.000
It it paraphrases it commentates it

1249
01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.400
it adds it Smooths.

1250
01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.600
It brings tradition into the text to

1251
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.700
bring out the meaning.

1252
01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.900
Irenaeus is in the western part of Europe.

1253
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.500
The very first Greek manuscript that we have that

1254
01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.600
contains the verse is codex e which

1255
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.200
is in a sixth century.

1256
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.800
Okay, and this is also a western manuscript?

1257
01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.600
So why did Erasmus put it in his text?

1258
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.100
If the manuscript evidence wasn't there, why did he

1259
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.900
do it? Let's look into his methodology here. So he had

1260
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.200
a manuscript.

1261
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.400
Of the Greek of the book of Acts and it

1262
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.300
had the verse but the

1263
01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.300
verse is located here in this red box.

1264
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.700
It's not in the main body.

1265
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.100
It's in the margin.

1266
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.700
Okay, and this is a manuscript from the 15th century,

1267
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.500
so it's not old.

1268
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.600
Remember Erasmus is living in the 16th century. So

1269
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.100
this is within a hundred years of Erasmus here.

1270
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.700
It's not old.

1271
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.300
Okay, but this was his evidence that he had

1272
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.800
to work with because he did not have remember. He did not have 5,800

1273
01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.300
manuscripts.

1274
01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:56.700
He used seven.

1275
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.400
So here's his methodology in his first edition of 1516 Erasmus

1276
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.400
claims that the verse quote is not

1277
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400
found in the Greek manuscripts.

1278
01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:12.600
he's familiar with it, but it is not found in the Greek manuscripts,

1279
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:12.900
but

1280
01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:17.100
because it is in his Latin version which

1281
01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:19.400
again remember Latin is mostly

1282
01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.000
over here in the western part.

1283
01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:22.500
of Europe

1284
01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:23.900
right

1285
01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.300
and because in his manuscript in

1286
01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.200
the Greek that he did have it's in the margin.

1287
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.700
He comes to this conclusion that however, I think the emission

1288
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.300
was the result of a negligent scribe.

1289
01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.100
Whether he knew it or not or would admit to it or

1290
01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.500
not. He is doing textual criticism. He is making a judgment.

1291
01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.300
Of whether that verse should be in the Bible or not.

1292
01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:54.400
And he made the Judgment that it should why because he

1293
01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.500
had Witnesses. He had the Latin which

1294
01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.400
has it in and he had this Greek manuscript which

1295
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.400
was on the side. Well, maybe the Scribe just

1296
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.500
like omitted it accidentally and

1297
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:09.500
let somebody later or put it on the side and it actually was a mistake

1298
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.800
and it should be long in the text. That was his

1299
01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.400
conclusion.

1300
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.300
The problem or one of the other problems is he did not

1301
01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.800
include that Greek text it was on the margin what

1302
01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.200
he did was he took the Latin because he thought that was

1303
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.000
better in this verse and back translated

1304
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.900
it into Greek.

1305
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.700
That opens up a whole other.

1306
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.900
Set of possible errors.

1307
01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:43.500
So by doing that he wrote down a Greek text

1308
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:47.000
for acts 8:37, which has never been found

1309
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.900
in any.

1310
01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.400
manuscript

1311
01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:50.400
ever

1312
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.400
except one that was in the 17th

1313
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.400
century or the late 16th century, which was

1314
01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.200
after Erasmus had lived.

1315
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.100
So that doesn't count.

1316
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.500
But it's this text.

1317
01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.800
that Erasmus chooses from the back translated

1318
01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.300
Latin

1319
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.700
Which gets?

1320
01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.500
solidified into the textus receptus

1321
01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:19.700
which then gets translated into the King James

1322
01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:20.400
Bible.

1323
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.500
But that text has never been found in any manuscript.

1324
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.100
So is this verse missing?

1325
01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.300
Does your Bible that does not include that?

1326
01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.300
Have an error. Did they take it out? Is it purposeful?

1327
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.900
Here's the logic flow. Here's the workflow. What we

1328
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:47.200
know is acts 8:37 was unjustifiably added

1329
01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.500
by Erasmus in 1516.

1330
01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.000
He made a textual criticism judgment call.

1331
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.000
That was not supported.

1332
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.800
He thought it was a mistake, but he had no proof of that.

1333
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.800
Now the verse designation.

1334
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:05.700
remember

1335
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.400
were originated by stefanus in his

1336
01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.200
Greek text in 1551.

1337
01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.500
Okay, that's after Erasmus now they

1338
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.200
get verses.

1339
01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.000
Added to it.

1340
01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.300
The King James is translated from a Greek

1341
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:28.500
addition that contained erasmus's text of the

1342
01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.000
verse.

1343
01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:33.200
and stefanus's first designation 37

1344
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:34.900
in it

1345
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.500
So the King James then has an ax 837.

1346
01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:45.300
But when textural criticism is later applied and

1347
01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:47.500
found that diverse is not

1348
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.000
original.

1349
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.200
It was a later Western addition in the

1350
01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.200
western part of the church in the early part of the church, but it

1351
01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.500
was in addition nonetheless when that was discovered.

1352
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.500
When you correctly remove the verse.

1353
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.600
number 37 goes away

1354
01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:09.100
because you can't Cascade back, right? You're not going to

1355
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.500
you're not gonna take away the tradition of verse 8:30 or

1356
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.100
38 is Now 37 39 is now 38. You're

1357
01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:15.500
not going to do that.

1358
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.800
It's much more simpler.

1359
01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.900
To just omit the entire verse.

1360
01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:25.100
And so that's what your version your ESV or your

1361
01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.500
NIV or whatever other Modern English Bible

1362
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.700
that you use has done.

1363
01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:34.700
They have applied that textual criticism methodology found

1364
01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:37.100
that the verse was not original by

1365
01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.200
doing that research.

1366
01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:41.900
Have omitted it and then verse 37.

1367
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.000
goes away

1368
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.400
So this is the official decision of the committee. I'm

1369
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.200
not going to read that. It's

1370
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:51.400
it's

1371
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.500
it's complex, but it does go through a lot of

1372
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.900
good data, but what I would suggest is

1373
01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.900
You have Bibles you have commentaries you have these other things if

1374
01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.700
you're at all interested in what we

1375
01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:07.700
talked about tonight.

1376
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:12.200
I would strongly encourage you to get a textural.

1377
01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:13.800
commentary

1378
01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.500
Okay textual commentary we'll go

1379
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.100
through exactly what we just did with acts 837 but

1380
01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.500
for every verse.

1381
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.300
That has these variants.

1382
01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:30.500
And go through and explain the textual

1383
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.500
criticism and how you arrive at the decision.

1384
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:34.900
of whether

1385
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.800
it's variant A or B or C or D or whatever. Okay.

1386
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.400
So a textural commentary will do

1387
01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.500
that. Here's just one example of one up here. This is Philip Comfort.

1388
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.300
It's it's actually

1389
01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:50.900
pretty well written it's exhaustive and

1390
01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.400
he will tell you which Modern English

1391
01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.400
versions have chosen variant A or B or C

1392
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.400
or D. And so it's it's fairly

1393
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.300
easily to digest.

1394
01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.600
Okay, but in our last minute.

1395
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.900
We want to address this critical question.

1396
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.200
Is our new testament reliable, we just found out

1397
01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.600
that there's 300 to 400,000 variants.

1398
01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.300
There's verses that are in one Bible, but not

1399
01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:23.000
another Bible.

1400
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.800
And I will tell you.

1401
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:30.600
That people have used everything that

1402
01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.400
I just said.

1403
01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.000
As an attack on the word of

1404
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:35.300
God.

1405
01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.500
as an argument for you and I

1406
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.500
to lose our trust in the Bible and what

1407
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:44.900
it says.

1408
01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.800
Okay, but let's walk through we've already walked through the science

1409
01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.100
part of this and how you know, we don't don't take these emotional

1410
01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.800
arguments and lose our faith.

1411
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.300
We just go no, let's sit down. Let's actually

1412
01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.100
look at this rationally and let's just

1413
01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:00.300
see.

1414
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.200
Who's right?

1415
01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.600
Okay, we learned in our first week.

1416
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.100
That God's word is inspired in the

1417
01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:11.300
original writings without error in their meeting in their

1418
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.500
meeting. Well now we're looking at copies ever since

1419
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.600
then we're looking at copies and there's no guarantee that

1420
01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.100
those copies are inerrant.

1421
01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.400
or perfect

1422
01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.400
I just showed you how seven Born Again Believers in our

1423
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.200
community group can try their best to copy God's word

1424
01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.400
and never get it, right.

1425
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:36.100
How much more when we have 5800 manuscripts and

1426
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.700
all these other languages as well?

1427
01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.200
But it is true. We do not have the

1428
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.100
original manuscripts and there are hundreds of thousands of

1429
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.800
variations in the copies.

1430
01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:47.800
but

1431
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.400
this is because we have an abundance of manuscripts.

1432
01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.600
Okay, and we've talked about the number.

1433
01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.200
And human beings were the ones who were

1434
01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.100
making the copies.

1435
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.000
And human beings are not known for being perfect.

1436
01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:10.200
Now let's address the variations and summarize this.

1437
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.000
99% are untranslatable.

1438
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:15.800
insignificant

1439
01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.500
or they're just not possibly original.

1440
01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.600
Remember I said the goal of textual criticism is to understand the

1441
01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.300
origination of an error if we

1442
01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.300
can understand the origination of an error we can rightly call

1443
01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.200
it an error.

1444
01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.100
And it becomes not even possible to be

1445
01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:33.900
an original.

1446
01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:35.100
writing

1447
01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.700
only 1% are significant impossible, but

1448
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.700
No, Christian doctrine is affected.

1449
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.000
In any way whatsoever.

1450
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.800
In that 1%

1451
01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:50.300
so therefore

1452
01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:53.400
we have a very high confidence.

1453
01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.500
A very high confidence in reconstructing the original New

1454
01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:57.800
Testament.

1455
01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.000
even in spite of those difficulties

1456
01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:06.400
Okay. I hope this has been informative. This has

1457
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.900
been something that's not often taught. I love it. I

1458
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:13.200
will be up here. If you want to talk about any additional questions,

1459
01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:15.300
you might have I'm hoping you

1460
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.400
do have questions, but at the most are the least

1461
01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:22.100
I hope this has been comforting because people

1462
01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.300
will talk about this.

1463
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.200
When they're attacking the faith.

1464
01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.800
Okay, I've heard it. I've seen it. I've watched YouTube. I've watched

1465
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.500
the videos. It's out there.

1466
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:38.200
But we have ways to deal with this. This is not

1467
01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:41.200
something that we just get up in arms and we panic and

1468
01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.200
we run and you know hide we can

1469
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.300
face this and this is something that

1470
01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:50.600
has been proven now over the last few centuries. So

1471
01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.400
this is nothing new.

1472
01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.500
At all, so at the very least I hope you understand and take

1473
01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.000
the the takeaways from this slide and I hope

1474
01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.800
it's a blessing and I hope it's a comfort and an encouragement.

1475
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.600
to you all but if you have other questions, I

1476
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.300
will be happy to

1477
01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.300
answer them. So thank you guys so much for coming out. I

1478
01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:09.600
appreciate it.
