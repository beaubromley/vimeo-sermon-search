WEBVTT

1
00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:19.645
Well, good morning.

2
00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:24.405
Well, that was good. It was good to, good

3
00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:25.565
to see you once again.

4
00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:29.045
And I always love coming to Henderson Hills.

5
00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:33.005
Uh, John, I've known for a very, very long time, uh,

6
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.045
before actually I moved to Oklahoma.

7
00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:38.565
John was one of my students, uh, in a demon, uh,

8
00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:40.165
seminar, if I'm not mistaken.

9
00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:43.925
And it was great. Uh, not demon, not demon

10
00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.405
doctor of ministry, I think it was.

11
00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:51.285
And, uh, anyway, it's great to be with him

12
00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:54.245
and I'm so grateful, uh, to your pastor for the invitation.

13
00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:59.045
And it's great that you guys are studying. First Samuel.

14
00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.605
I love First Samuel. How many

15
00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:06.125
of you have really enjoyed this series on First Samuel?

16
00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:10.965
I have, yeah. It's great hearing, uh,

17
00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:13.245
what God is doing in the life of this church.

18
00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:16.365
And really, when we open God's word, uh,

19
00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:17.965
unbelievable things happen.

20
00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:20.445
It's no wonder that the Bible is described

21
00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:23.525
as sharper than a two-edged sword.

22
00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:28.205
It's able to cleave joint and marrow.

23
00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:30.225
I mean, that's pretty powerful

24
00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:31.465
when we think about the word of God.

25
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:36.505
And, uh, there's a reason why it's described that way,

26
00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:38.985
because indeed it cuts us asunder.

27
00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:42.865
It, it opens us up, it lays bare our intentions,

28
00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:44.745
our hidden desires,

29
00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.945
and all of the things that are deep inside of us.

30
00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:49.825
It opens all of that up.

31
00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:52.825
And that's actually what's gonna happen today

32
00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:56.545
as we look at one Samuel Chapter 14.

33
00:01:57.085 --> 00:01:59.225
So I'm gonna ask you if you have your Bible, go ahead

34
00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:01.745
and open to one Samuel 14, uh,

35
00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:03.665
because that's the passage that we're going

36
00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:04.905
to be exploring today.

37
00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:06.545
And the way that we're gonna approach this is I'm gonna

38
00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:10.745
read, uh, really verses 24 through 52.

39
00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:12.705
That's a lot of text, so hang with me.

40
00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:17.705
But I'm gonna be referring back to verses one through 23.

41
00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:19.545
And what you need to understand about this passage

42
00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:23.005
of scripture is this is a, uh, uh,

43
00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:25.445
basically a little embedded story about

44
00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:28.655
Jonathan and Saul.

45
00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:33.415
Saul is the king of Israel. Jonathan is his son.

46
00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:38.205
And actually this story of Saul

47
00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.685
and Jonathan begins

48
00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:42.725
with a focus on Jonathan in verses one through 23.

49
00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:47.645
And then it turns to Saul in verses 24 through 52.

50
00:02:48.025 --> 00:02:50.645
So I'm gonna be referring to Saul and Jonathan

51
00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:54.085
because what the text actually does is establishes a

52
00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:58.325
contrast between the life and the intention, the desire

53
00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:02.925
and the faith of Jonathan versus the life, the intention,

54
00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:06.005
the desire, and the faith of Saul.

55
00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:09.005
And when we look at these two figures,

56
00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:12.405
we see a little bit of ourselves.

57
00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:15.385
So we're gonna look at that together.

58
00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:17.385
Now, what you need to understand about first

59
00:03:17.685 --> 00:03:20.905
and second Samuel is they're really actually one book.

60
00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:24.505
And they tell the story of the rise

61
00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:27.425
of the king in Israel.

62
00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:31.375
And, uh, it's not just the king, any old king.

63
00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:33.855
It's the king that God desires.

64
00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:38.315
And so it opens with this story about

65
00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:42.715
a woman named Hannah who can't have a baby,

66
00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:46.715
and God does something miraculous on her behalf.

67
00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:50.675
And she sings a song in, uh, first Samuel chapter two.

68
00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:53.995
And that embedded in there, she talks about the king.

69
00:03:55.105 --> 00:03:59.365
And then in second Samuel 22, uh, second Samuel, chapter 22

70
00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:03.285
and 23, 1 of the things that you see is at the end of that,

71
00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:06.125
there's another little, uh, poem,

72
00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:08.645
and it's sung by David.

73
00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:10.765
And in there he talks about the king.

74
00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:12.005
The reason this is important is

75
00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:14.685
because it's almost like the bookends of the, of this book

76
00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:16.605
talk about the king

77
00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:20.645
and how God is the rock that we can trust

78
00:04:20.985 --> 00:04:22.605
and he's gonna raise up a king.

79
00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:25.725
And so it raises this question, who is this king?

80
00:04:27.155 --> 00:04:29.775
And the rest of one and two Samuel? Play that out.

81
00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:32.855
Here we are in one Samuel 14,

82
00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:36.615
Saul has been anointed as king over Israel.

83
00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:41.085
And yet in chapter 13, which you may remember,

84
00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:44.885
Saul has been rejected as king.

85
00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:49.325
And then 14, you have the story we're gonna look at today.

86
00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:52.485
And then in chapter 15, more bad news for Saul.

87
00:04:52.485 --> 00:04:55.725
So already in the kind of the frame

88
00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:58.725
around verse chapter 14, you get

89
00:04:59.525 --> 00:05:01.005
negative portraits about Saul.

90
00:05:01.005 --> 00:05:05.095
And that's important because that helps us understand how

91
00:05:05.095 --> 00:05:07.375
to read Saul's actions.

92
00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:09.095
How many of you like movies?

93
00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:14.095
Or how many of you like to watch videos on your device?

94
00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:19.095
Anybody? If you like your device, raise, flash it at me.

95
00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:22.055
Somebody's on Netflix right now. That's rude.

96
00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:28.135
What you need to understand about what you need

97
00:05:28.135 --> 00:05:30.735
to understand about, uh, biblical narrative, like first,

98
00:05:30.735 --> 00:05:34.035
second Samuel, we like to think that it's, uh,

99
00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:35.835
telling us everything.

100
00:05:35.975 --> 00:05:37.115
But if you could imagine,

101
00:05:37.575 --> 00:05:39.035
and you might want to do this right now,

102
00:05:39.075 --> 00:05:40.315
I give you permission to do this.

103
00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:44.355
Uh, turn on your, if you've got your, your, your device,

104
00:05:44.825 --> 00:05:47.475
turn on your, uh, your video.

105
00:05:48.305 --> 00:05:50.555
I've got mine on, right? I'm looking at myself now.

106
00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:52.475
It's looking at you, right?

107
00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:54.395
Turn on your video, and I want you

108
00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:56.995
to look like scan my, the stage.

109
00:05:57.225 --> 00:06:00.155
Do it right. Now, this is very important.

110
00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:03.675
Make your own little movie. Don't take pictures of me.

111
00:06:03.755 --> 00:06:07.515
I haven't authorized that, right? But take a look.

112
00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:09.235
If you were watching a little video

113
00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:11.515
or creating a video, this is what you need to understand.

114
00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:15.235
As you move around, you're setting the frame on what's

115
00:06:15.235 --> 00:06:16.275
important and what's not.

116
00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:19.675
You can zoom in, you can zoom out, you can say,

117
00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:22.235
I'll only show this bit, but I'm not gonna show that bit.

118
00:06:22.335 --> 00:06:24.115
How do you do that? You do this through your camera.

119
00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:29.235
So you and I both understand how to set different kind of,

120
00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:32.075
uh, layers of focus on our devices.

121
00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:34.115
What you need to understand is in the biblical

122
00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:36.035
text, it does the same thing.

123
00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:40.595
It doesn't tell us everything about Saul's life

124
00:06:40.655 --> 00:06:43.675
or his reign, or David's life or his reign.

125
00:06:43.935 --> 00:06:47.755
It really zooms in and frames up certain situations

126
00:06:48.015 --> 00:06:50.595
or certain stories in the life of Saul or of David

127
00:06:50.895 --> 00:06:53.195
or of Jonathan, to tell the story.

128
00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:56.535
And what is the story? This is the story.

129
00:06:57.515 --> 00:07:01.045
Who is the king that Israel needs?

130
00:07:02.445 --> 00:07:05.625
And so what we're gonna talk about today is lessons.

131
00:07:06.805 --> 00:07:10.985
In fact, we're gonna have seven lessons from the story of

132
00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:15.185
Saul and Jonathan that help us understand

133
00:07:15.805 --> 00:07:17.465
the king we need.

134
00:07:18.055 --> 00:07:20.345
Okay? You with me? Alright.

135
00:07:20.415 --> 00:07:23.905
Open your Bible to one Samuel Chapter 14.

136
00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:27.465
Now, what you need to understand is in verses one

137
00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:31.305
through 23, Jonathan has instigated a fight

138
00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:32.665
with the Philistines.

139
00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:38.375
And in this fight, God does this miraculous, uh, victory.

140
00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:41.055
And then the fight continues

141
00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:44.815
and it continues, and it continues.

142
00:07:44.875 --> 00:07:48.015
And now in verse 23

143
00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:52.895
and 24, we see the the fight is continuing on and

144
00:07:52.915 --> 00:07:54.295
and God's people are, are,

145
00:07:54.595 --> 00:07:56.495
are really pursuing the Philistines.

146
00:07:56.915 --> 00:07:59.335
So the battle extends beyond Beth Aven

147
00:07:59.955 --> 00:08:02.175
and the men of Israel were worn out that day.

148
00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:06.655
Now, why were they worn out from fighting? Well, not really.

149
00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:10.055
The reason that they're worn out is not just

150
00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.615
because of the fight, but

151
00:08:11.615 --> 00:08:14.375
because of this, Paul, uh, Saul

152
00:08:15.275 --> 00:08:17.335
had placed the troops under an O oath.

153
00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:19.575
The man who eats food before evening

154
00:08:19.635 --> 00:08:23.615
before I've taken vengeance on my enemies is cursed.

155
00:08:24.355 --> 00:08:28.015
You might wanna underline that verse. Why?

156
00:08:28.685 --> 00:08:31.735
Because it reveals a little bit about Saul

157
00:08:31.735 --> 00:08:32.895
and what's important to him.

158
00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.415
So none of the troops tasted any food.

159
00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.575
Verse 25, everyone went into the forest

160
00:08:38.635 --> 00:08:39.735
and there was honey on the ground.

161
00:08:39.755 --> 00:08:44.175
So they, he's just uttered this oak, this vow.

162
00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:48.055
He said, if anybody eats food from my army,

163
00:08:49.105 --> 00:08:50.245
you're gonna be a curse.

164
00:08:50.435 --> 00:08:52.525
They go into the forest, and guess what?

165
00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:56.605
There's food on the ground. What is it, honey?

166
00:08:57.705 --> 00:09:00.685
And when the troops entered the forest, they saw the flow

167
00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:02.685
of honey, but none of them ate any of it

168
00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:05.485
because they feared the oath that Saul had made.

169
00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:09.245
However, Jonathan, you remember, Jonathan is Saul's son.

170
00:09:09.705 --> 00:09:11.645
He hadn't heard his father make the oath

171
00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:13.725
or the troops swear the oath.

172
00:09:14.425 --> 00:09:16.165
So he reached out with the end of his staff,

173
00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:18.405
he was carrying, dipped it into the honeycomb.

174
00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:20.965
And when he ate the honey, uh,

175
00:09:21.105 --> 00:09:23.245
the Bible says his eyes lit up,

176
00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:25.525
or, uh, he had light in his eyes.

177
00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:28.605
It basically, he revived himself. He renewed his energy.

178
00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.565
Then one of the troops said,

179
00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:34.045
your father made the troops solemnly swear.

180
00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:36.605
The man who eats food today is cursed

181
00:09:36.865 --> 00:09:38.485
and the troops are exhausted.

182
00:09:39.805 --> 00:09:44.485
Jonathan replied, my father has brought trouble to the land.

183
00:09:44.635 --> 00:09:45.725
Underline that phrase,

184
00:09:46.545 --> 00:09:49.165
my father has brought trouble to the land.

185
00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.085
Just look at how I've renewed energy

186
00:09:51.205 --> 00:09:52.845
because I tasted a little of this, honey.

187
00:09:53.265 --> 00:09:56.045
How much better? If the troops had eaten freely from the

188
00:09:56.045 --> 00:09:59.125
plunder they took from their enemies, then the slaughter,

189
00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:01.125
the Philistines would've been much greater.

190
00:10:02.525 --> 00:10:04.015
Then you have a summary statement.

191
00:10:05.275 --> 00:10:07.415
The, the Israelites struck down the Philistines

192
00:10:07.415 --> 00:10:10.055
that day from Mik mash all the way the Agilon,

193
00:10:10.745 --> 00:10:13.695
since the Israelites were completely exhausted, they rushed

194
00:10:13.695 --> 00:10:17.415
to the plunder, took sheep, goats, cattle calves,

195
00:10:18.055 --> 00:10:19.735
slaughtered them on the ground, ate meat

196
00:10:19.735 --> 00:10:20.935
with the blood still in it.

197
00:10:21.195 --> 00:10:25.575
Now, just so we're clear, this, uh, the,

198
00:10:25.595 --> 00:10:29.855
the chase from mash all the way the a agilon is, um,

199
00:10:31.085 --> 00:10:32.575
it's about 15 miles.

200
00:10:34.305 --> 00:10:38.355
So imagine chasing an army through hill country,

201
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:43.715
over rocks and terrain fighting for 15 miles all day.

202
00:10:45.155 --> 00:10:47.475
I mean, I've got two kids at home still.

203
00:10:47.615 --> 00:10:49.955
Two of my kids are in college, two of my kids are at home.

204
00:10:51.015 --> 00:10:53.555
And, uh, they're, they're not fighting all well, most

205
00:10:53.555 --> 00:10:54.995
of the time they're not fighting all day.

206
00:10:56.175 --> 00:10:58.075
But I'm just thinking about my son.

207
00:10:58.295 --> 00:11:02.355
The amount of food he eats on a normal day is shocking.

208
00:11:05.075 --> 00:11:06.995
I I cannot imagine how famished

209
00:11:08.065 --> 00:11:10.295
these warriors would be if they were chasing

210
00:11:10.395 --> 00:11:13.295
and fighting for 15 miles all day long.

211
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:16.475
And their king had said, you can't eat any food.

212
00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:21.565
Well, guess what happens? The day is up.

213
00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:24.925
They start seeing all the plunder, the Philistines,

214
00:11:24.925 --> 00:11:26.045
and that is the animals.

215
00:11:26.825 --> 00:11:28.285
And they say, we're really hungry.

216
00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:30.485
'cause we said that we wouldn't eat and we haven't eaten.

217
00:11:30.825 --> 00:11:32.485
The day is over, now we're going to eat.

218
00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:36.925
And so they begin to slaughter all of the sheep

219
00:11:36.925 --> 00:11:40.245
and the goats and the cattle and the calves on the ground

220
00:11:40.305 --> 00:11:42.285
and ate meat with the blood still in it.

221
00:11:42.305 --> 00:11:43.445
Now, why is that significant?

222
00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.605
What they did is they were so hungry

223
00:11:45.665 --> 00:11:47.445
and famish, they took the animals

224
00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:49.645
and they put 'em on the ground and slaughtered them.

225
00:11:49.965 --> 00:11:52.085
Normally what would happen is you would hang it according

226
00:11:52.085 --> 00:11:54.925
to Israelite law so that the blood would drain out,

227
00:11:56.695 --> 00:11:58.835
and that was how it was supposed to be done.

228
00:11:58.855 --> 00:12:01.795
So when it says they eat the, they ate the meat

229
00:12:01.795 --> 00:12:02.835
with the blood still in it,

230
00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:04.595
it means they made the slaughter on the ground

231
00:12:04.815 --> 00:12:07.155
and they were so hungry, they just quickly

232
00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:09.675
made a quick slaughter, didn't drain the meat,

233
00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:13.315
drained the blood, which was a violation of the law.

234
00:12:14.965 --> 00:12:17.125
And that's bad, okay?

235
00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:20.405
So Somem reported to Saul, look,

236
00:12:20.425 --> 00:12:22.005
the troops are sinning against the Lord

237
00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:23.565
by eating meat with the blood in it.

238
00:12:23.905 --> 00:12:25.725
And Saul said, you've been unfaithful,

239
00:12:26.035 --> 00:12:28.085
roll a large stone over here at once.

240
00:12:28.585 --> 00:12:31.125
And then he said, go among the troops

241
00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:34.685
and say to them, let each man bring me his ous sheep,

242
00:12:34.785 --> 00:12:37.085
do the slaughtering here on this stone

243
00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:38.925
so it's not on the ground.

244
00:12:38.985 --> 00:12:40.645
So the blood can drain out a little bit.

245
00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.155
Do do the slaughtering here,

246
00:12:43.175 --> 00:12:45.155
and then you can eat, don't sin against the Lord

247
00:12:45.155 --> 00:12:46.355
by eating meat with the blood in it.

248
00:12:46.935 --> 00:12:49.995
So every one of the troops brought his ox that night

249
00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:51.315
and slaughtered it there.

250
00:12:52.465 --> 00:12:55.195
Then Saul built an altar to the Lord.

251
00:12:55.295 --> 00:12:58.275
It was the first time he had built an altar to the Lord.

252
00:12:59.455 --> 00:13:01.355
Now that's an interesting note.

253
00:13:02.065 --> 00:13:03.715
This is the first time as king,

254
00:13:04.545 --> 00:13:06.045
he has built an altar to the Lord.

255
00:13:07.085 --> 00:13:10.395
We'll come back to that. Saul said, let's go down

256
00:13:10.395 --> 00:13:11.795
after the Philistines tonight

257
00:13:11.795 --> 00:13:13.195
and plum to them until morning.

258
00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:16.075
Don't even let one remain. Do whatever you want.

259
00:13:16.075 --> 00:13:17.355
The troops replied.

260
00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:21.485
But the priest said, well, I think we,

261
00:13:21.705 --> 00:13:23.565
we should approach God, the here.

262
00:13:24.145 --> 00:13:28.285
So Saul inquired of God, and he said, should I go

263
00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:29.445
after the Philistines?

264
00:13:29.995 --> 00:13:33.125
Will you hand them over to Israel? Now look at what happens.

265
00:13:33.665 --> 00:13:37.325
He asked God because the priest encouraged him to do so,

266
00:13:38.725 --> 00:13:40.095
whether he should go into battle.

267
00:13:40.115 --> 00:13:41.135
And he said, you know, are the

268
00:13:41.135 --> 00:13:42.375
Philistines gonna be handed over?

269
00:13:42.475 --> 00:13:43.535
And God didn't answer.

270
00:13:46.835 --> 00:13:50.165
Saul said, verse 38, all the, all, all you leaders

271
00:13:50.185 --> 00:13:51.245
of the troops come here.

272
00:13:51.615 --> 00:13:52.645
Let's investigate.

273
00:13:52.655 --> 00:13:55.365
Let's figure out how this sin has occurred today.

274
00:13:55.665 --> 00:13:57.125
And then he makes another vow.

275
00:13:57.445 --> 00:14:01.365
Remember the first vow was, if anybody eats food today,

276
00:14:02.265 --> 00:14:03.765
before I have vengeance on my

277
00:14:03.765 --> 00:14:04.965
enemies, you're gonna be cursed.

278
00:14:05.025 --> 00:14:07.965
Now, he makes another vow that's rash.

279
00:14:09.145 --> 00:14:12.735
And he says this, as surely as the Lord lives,

280
00:14:13.275 --> 00:14:15.575
who sa saves Israel, even if it's

281
00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:20.385
because of my son, Jonathan, that did the sin

282
00:14:20.385 --> 00:14:22.905
that prevents God from answering Saul.

283
00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:28.425
He says, even if it's Jonathan, that person must die.

284
00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:32.455
Not one of the troops answered him.

285
00:14:32.835 --> 00:14:36.855
So he said to all Israel, you'll be on one side, and my

286
00:14:37.475 --> 00:14:39.135
and my son, Jonathan will be,

287
00:14:39.355 --> 00:14:41.495
and I am my son, Jonathan will be on the other side.

288
00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.655
And the troops replied, do whatever you want.

289
00:14:44.435 --> 00:14:47.455
So Saul said to the Lord, God of Israel,

290
00:14:47.755 --> 00:14:49.975
why have you not answered your servant today?

291
00:14:50.355 --> 00:14:52.005
If the unrighteousness is in me

292
00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:56.005
or my son, Jonathan Lord God of Israel, give orim.

293
00:14:56.465 --> 00:14:59.485
But if the fault is your people, Israel give tome.

294
00:14:59.515 --> 00:15:01.125
This is the rum and the thme.

295
00:15:01.265 --> 00:15:04.605
It is, uh, it's a way of discerning the will of God.

296
00:15:05.595 --> 00:15:06.655
And they little stones.

297
00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:09.015
One is, um, more of a whitish color

298
00:15:09.155 --> 00:15:10.615
and one is a darker color.

299
00:15:11.435 --> 00:15:13.215
And if you get the darker color,

300
00:15:14.075 --> 00:15:15.855
you're the one who's in trouble.

301
00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:18.895
And if you get the whiter color of the rock,

302
00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:20.615
then you're clear.

303
00:15:21.515 --> 00:15:22.565
Well, guess what happened?

304
00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:25.035
Jonathan and Saul were selected

305
00:15:25.695 --> 00:15:27.555
and the troops were clear to the charge.

306
00:15:28.265 --> 00:15:30.875
Then Saul said, cast the lot between me,

307
00:15:30.895 --> 00:15:31.995
my, my son, Jonathan.

308
00:15:32.055 --> 00:15:35.515
And Jonathan was selected. Saul commanded him.

309
00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:36.635
Tell me what you did.

310
00:15:37.715 --> 00:15:41.095
So Jonathan said to him, well, I tasted a little honey

311
00:15:41.095 --> 00:15:43.495
with the end of my staff, I was carrying, I'm ready to die.

312
00:15:50.465 --> 00:15:54.075
Saul declared to him, may God punish me and do so severely.

313
00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:57.915
If you do not die, Jonathan.

314
00:15:59.755 --> 00:16:01.535
And then all of a sudden, guess what happens?

315
00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:05.055
The people say to Saul, must Jonathan die?

316
00:16:05.955 --> 00:16:08.175
He accomplished such a great deliverance for Israel.

317
00:16:08.195 --> 00:16:12.255
No, as the Lord lives, not a hair of his head will fall

318
00:16:12.255 --> 00:16:15.055
to the ground for he worked with God's help today.

319
00:16:17.445 --> 00:16:20.185
So the people redeemed Jonathan

320
00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:22.545
and he didn't die.

321
00:16:22.855 --> 00:16:25.225
Then Saul gave up the pursuit of the Philistines,

322
00:16:25.405 --> 00:16:27.665
and the Philistines returned to their own territory.

323
00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:29.545
And then you have a summary statement

324
00:16:29.545 --> 00:16:31.825
of Saul's kingship that says this.

325
00:16:32.015 --> 00:16:33.945
When Saul assumed kingship over Israel,

326
00:16:33.945 --> 00:16:35.465
he fought against all his enemies,

327
00:16:35.845 --> 00:16:37.865
all his enemies in every direction.

328
00:16:38.495 --> 00:16:40.225
Moab the Ammonites, Edem, the kings

329
00:16:40.225 --> 00:16:41.985
of Zah and the Philistines.

330
00:16:42.225 --> 00:16:43.945
Wherever he turned, he caused havoc.

331
00:16:44.565 --> 00:16:46.745
He fought, bravely, defeated the Amalekites

332
00:16:46.745 --> 00:16:48.585
and rescued Israel from those who plundered them.

333
00:16:49.555 --> 00:16:51.465
Sauls sons were Jonathan ish

334
00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:56.495
and, uh, Mahua, the names of his two daughters were Meab,

335
00:16:56.835 --> 00:16:58.215
his firstborn and Michal.

336
00:16:58.515 --> 00:17:02.015
The the younger, the name of Saul's wife was, I know him,

337
00:17:02.015 --> 00:17:03.615
the daughter of Aima.

338
00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:07.375
The name of the commander of his army was Abner's, son

339
00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:10.255
of Saul's, uncle n You're gonna

340
00:17:10.495 --> 00:17:11.575
remember all these names, right?

341
00:17:13.025 --> 00:17:17.005
Saul's father was Kish, Abner's father was na son of Aviel.

342
00:17:17.865 --> 00:17:19.725
The conflict with the Philistines was

343
00:17:19.725 --> 00:17:21.205
fierce, all of Saul's day.

344
00:17:22.425 --> 00:17:24.725
So whenever Saul noticed any strong

345
00:17:24.745 --> 00:17:27.955
or valiant man, he enlisted him.

346
00:17:28.135 --> 00:17:32.715
Now, what you need to focus on is this opening,

347
00:17:33.095 --> 00:17:36.755
uh, verse verse 24, where Saul says,

348
00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.075
I'm gonna take vengeance on my enemies.

349
00:17:40.755 --> 00:17:42.775
And, uh, you can't eat any food.

350
00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:46.975
And if you do before I take vengeance on my enemies, uh,

351
00:17:47.075 --> 00:17:48.295
you know you're cursed.

352
00:17:48.395 --> 00:17:49.645
That's the rash vowel.

353
00:17:49.645 --> 00:17:54.515
Verse 24, the concluding sec, uh, verse of this section.

354
00:17:54.525 --> 00:17:59.395
Verse 20, uh, 52, Saul, the text says,

355
00:18:00.465 --> 00:18:01.475
Saul fighting men.

356
00:18:01.495 --> 00:18:04.115
And whenever he saw one, he goes, I, uh, you're on my team.

357
00:18:05.135 --> 00:18:07.155
Now that means good strategy, right?

358
00:18:07.175 --> 00:18:08.715
If he's a king, he wants to,

359
00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.875
but it tells us a little bit something about Saul.

360
00:18:12.985 --> 00:18:14.555
He's worried about his enemies,

361
00:18:15.145 --> 00:18:16.795
he's worried about his kingdom.

362
00:18:17.505 --> 00:18:20.235
He's worried about bringing people to his side.

363
00:18:20.735 --> 00:18:23.755
And the text is framing up through those pronouns.

364
00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:27.355
I, me, my Saul's

365
00:18:27.355 --> 00:18:29.535
heart, it's about him.

366
00:18:30.995 --> 00:18:33.735
But who's the book of one Samuel about God

367
00:18:34.035 --> 00:18:36.335
and the king that God will bring?

368
00:18:38.635 --> 00:18:40.265
We'll, we'll unpack that in just a minute.

369
00:18:41.465 --> 00:18:43.805
So this passage of scripture is really important

370
00:18:43.805 --> 00:18:45.565
and it, it shows us some lessons

371
00:18:45.635 --> 00:18:49.455
that we need to learn.

372
00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:52.155
Okay? Here's the first lesson.

373
00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.525
It comes in verses one through 23,

374
00:18:56.025 --> 00:18:59.925
and it contrasts against Saul and his perspective.

375
00:19:00.465 --> 00:19:04.785
And it's the lesson of perhaps the power

376
00:19:05.365 --> 00:19:07.165
of perhaps

377
00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:12.655
P-E-R-H-A-P-S perhaps.

378
00:19:14.115 --> 00:19:18.055
Now, Saul, according to the text,

379
00:19:18.395 --> 00:19:20.535
his focus really is on himself.

380
00:19:22.775 --> 00:19:26.635
And because of that, he has a tendency

381
00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:32.155
to treat God in a very particular way as a means to his end.

382
00:19:33.815 --> 00:19:38.185
Jonathan, by contrast, has a relationship with God.

383
00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:40.945
He doesn't treat God like a screwdriver

384
00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:42.665
that he can use to get what he wants.

385
00:19:43.245 --> 00:19:47.715
He treats God like God, the one

386
00:19:47.835 --> 00:19:51.155
with whom he must deal, the one

387
00:19:51.155 --> 00:19:53.075
with whom he has a relationship.

388
00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:54.915
And Jonathan's relationship

389
00:19:54.915 --> 00:19:57.555
with God is real in evident in the ways

390
00:19:57.555 --> 00:19:58.795
that he speaks about God.

391
00:19:58.815 --> 00:20:00.315
So if you have your Bible, turn back

392
00:20:00.315 --> 00:20:01.795
to the beginning of chapter 14.

393
00:20:02.775 --> 00:20:07.195
And if you look around verse

394
00:20:07.655 --> 00:20:11.235
six, you get a little glimpse into the,

395
00:20:11.415 --> 00:20:12.555
the heart of Jonathan.

396
00:20:13.905 --> 00:20:15.365
He talks to his armor bearer.

397
00:20:15.365 --> 00:20:16.725
It's just he and his armor bearer.

398
00:20:16.725 --> 00:20:18.045
He is looking up at the garrison

399
00:20:18.045 --> 00:20:19.445
of the Philistines up on a hill

400
00:20:19.445 --> 00:20:21.645
and he says, you know, I think we should go take that.

401
00:20:22.645 --> 00:20:26.465
I mean, after all, they're up there.

402
00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:28.625
Let's see if we can go take it.

403
00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:30.545
And he says this, come let us.

404
00:20:30.545 --> 00:20:32.105
This is verse six of chapter 14.

405
00:20:32.285 --> 00:20:34.825
Let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised.

406
00:20:34.825 --> 00:20:35.905
That is the Philistines.

407
00:20:36.885 --> 00:20:39.145
And in the ESV, the English standard version,

408
00:20:39.205 --> 00:20:40.265
it translates the Hebrew.

409
00:20:40.335 --> 00:20:42.705
This way. It may be that the Lord will work for us,

410
00:20:43.085 --> 00:20:45.385
for nothing can hinder the Lord from saving

411
00:20:46.085 --> 00:20:47.805
by many or by few.

412
00:20:48.305 --> 00:20:52.045
In other versions, that phrase it may be is translated.

413
00:20:52.235 --> 00:20:54.285
Perhaps it's the Hebrew word, ULA.

414
00:20:54.585 --> 00:20:56.845
If you're interested, most of you aren't,

415
00:20:56.845 --> 00:20:58.845
and that's fine, right?

416
00:20:58.875 --> 00:21:02.745
It's this Hebrew word, ula, perhaps, perhaps

417
00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:06.985
it shows up in key moments in actually in the Old Testament.

418
00:21:07.915 --> 00:21:12.645
Uh, when the Neite king in the book of Jonah

419
00:21:13.695 --> 00:21:15.115
is facing obliteration

420
00:21:16.405 --> 00:21:20.425
and Jonah has preached, the king goes, well,

421
00:21:21.065 --> 00:21:22.825
I think we should repent.

422
00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:26.305
I mean, after all, perhaps God will save us.

423
00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:31.465
Perhaps God is free to do whatever he wants.

424
00:21:33.355 --> 00:21:38.275
God can save as Jonathan says, by many whole big army

425
00:21:38.815 --> 00:21:42.715
or at, in this case, in verses one through 23, God can save

426
00:21:43.065 --> 00:21:46.555
with the king's son, Jonathan and his armor bearer.

427
00:21:47.135 --> 00:21:49.895
Few, God's free to do whatever he wants.

428
00:21:50.635 --> 00:21:51.775
Why does Jonathan know that?

429
00:21:51.775 --> 00:21:53.295
Because he has a relationship with God.

430
00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:57.765
Saul wants to manipulate God to his side.

431
00:21:59.005 --> 00:22:01.725
Jonathan just wants to walk in his relationship with God.

432
00:22:03.095 --> 00:22:06.595
So this language of perhaps opens us up to that truth.

433
00:22:08.665 --> 00:22:12.285
It may be that God will give deliverance this day.

434
00:22:12.305 --> 00:22:14.485
He can do it with a few, or he can do it with many.

435
00:22:16.025 --> 00:22:18.205
Why does Jonathan use this language of perhaps

436
00:22:18.205 --> 00:22:21.285
because he knows God, he rightly states

437
00:22:21.315 --> 00:22:23.445
that God can save?

438
00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:28.155
That's true. And it's true that God can save with many

439
00:22:28.895 --> 00:22:30.195
an army or a few.

440
00:22:30.655 --> 00:22:34.195
That's true. God can use a small group to do mighty things.

441
00:22:34.195 --> 00:22:37.265
After all, Gideon, in the book of Judges,

442
00:22:39.405 --> 00:22:42.545
God uses small group to conquer a many people.

443
00:22:43.545 --> 00:22:45.085
Or think about the 12 disciples.

444
00:22:46.545 --> 00:22:48.165
12 people changed the world.

445
00:22:49.065 --> 00:22:52.045
God can use few or he can use many.

446
00:22:52.045 --> 00:22:55.845
Look at the church today, few people with maximum impact,

447
00:22:55.865 --> 00:22:59.445
but sometimes God uses many people to impact many.

448
00:23:00.035 --> 00:23:02.645
It's the free choice of God, which he will use

449
00:23:03.025 --> 00:23:06.085
and which he will choose to use at whichever time, according

450
00:23:06.085 --> 00:23:08.925
to his own will, his own desire, his own pleasure.

451
00:23:09.155 --> 00:23:12.925
He's God. So it's true that God will use Jonathan

452
00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:14.405
and his armor bearer.

453
00:23:15.385 --> 00:23:18.765
That's true. Or is it Jonathan doesn't know.

454
00:23:19.645 --> 00:23:21.545
He says, well, if you look at the story of Israel,

455
00:23:21.805 --> 00:23:25.905
he could do either so perhaps he'll use us.

456
00:23:26.335 --> 00:23:29.945
Perhaps he won. It's up to the free choice of God.

457
00:23:32.455 --> 00:23:35.855
Jonathan is not trying to make God

458
00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:37.495
do something.

459
00:23:38.035 --> 00:23:40.055
He recognizes who God is.

460
00:23:41.005 --> 00:23:45.045
He recognizes God is utterly free in his relationship

461
00:23:45.245 --> 00:23:47.165
with you and his relationship with me.

462
00:23:47.165 --> 00:23:50.965
So what's grounding his faith? He knows God.

463
00:23:52.715 --> 00:23:56.145
He trusts God. He's in relationship with God.

464
00:23:57.655 --> 00:23:58.955
So he is able to confirm

465
00:23:59.175 --> 00:24:02.835
and affirm the truth of God while leaving God free to do

466
00:24:02.865 --> 00:24:05.555
what he wants to do in his situation.

467
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:08.715
It's the power of perhaps, eh, I don't know. Perhaps.

468
00:24:08.845 --> 00:24:11.645
We'll see. I trust him either way.

469
00:24:15.165 --> 00:24:18.395
Saul is very different than Jonathan.

470
00:24:20.605 --> 00:24:24.825
Saul's purpose is to get vengeance on his enemies. Verse 24.

471
00:24:26.515 --> 00:24:30.215
And so what he's doing throughout this passage

472
00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:34.215
is using religious stuff to get

473
00:24:34.955 --> 00:24:36.095
God to act.

474
00:24:37.155 --> 00:24:39.655
You know what it's like? How many of you like, uh,

475
00:24:40.955 --> 00:24:42.085
gumball machines?

476
00:24:43.905 --> 00:24:45.145
I like gumball machines.

477
00:24:45.245 --> 00:24:47.465
In fact, there's a picture of a gumball machine.

478
00:24:49.725 --> 00:24:53.475
Oftentimes we treat God like a glorified

479
00:24:53.705 --> 00:24:54.915
gumball machine.

480
00:24:55.915 --> 00:24:59.805
I'll put my quarter of faith in, manipulate God to act

481
00:25:00.385 --> 00:25:01.685
so I can get what I want.

482
00:25:01.785 --> 00:25:05.565
My gumball. But God is not a gumball machine.

483
00:25:06.405 --> 00:25:09.925
There's always, perhaps, I don't know

484
00:25:10.725 --> 00:25:12.465
either way, I trust God.

485
00:25:13.075 --> 00:25:17.195
Isn't that true? In the life of faith, wherever you remember

486
00:25:17.195 --> 00:25:19.595
that old song, wherever he leads, I'll go.

487
00:25:20.495 --> 00:25:23.135
He may lead us here. He may lead us there.

488
00:25:24.375 --> 00:25:27.495
He may heal, he may provide ultimate healing in heaven.

489
00:25:28.275 --> 00:25:31.905
God is free. We're contingent.

490
00:25:35.065 --> 00:25:37.085
So what does God invite us to do?

491
00:25:38.805 --> 00:25:43.515
Trust him in relationship with him.

492
00:25:44.405 --> 00:25:46.825
The more that we have a close relationship, we see, we see

493
00:25:46.825 --> 00:25:49.485
that God is better than anything.

494
00:25:50.185 --> 00:25:52.805
And so Jonathan was content to say perhaps.

495
00:25:53.005 --> 00:25:56.205
I mean, if we go up and we die, who cares? I trust him.

496
00:25:57.705 --> 00:26:01.555
Saul, by contrast, wants to use God.

497
00:26:02.395 --> 00:26:04.405
What about you? What about me?

498
00:26:06.725 --> 00:26:08.225
Do we understand the power of perhaps?

499
00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:12.425
Are we trying to manipulate God? Just a question.

500
00:26:13.265 --> 00:26:14.595
It's a lesson we must learn.

501
00:26:15.105 --> 00:26:18.885
Lesson two, faith matters

502
00:26:19.955 --> 00:26:23.645
most talked about Jonathan's relationship with God draws us

503
00:26:23.645 --> 00:26:27.285
to con consider this truth about faith.

504
00:26:27.505 --> 00:26:31.365
It matters most. Saul is worried about position.

505
00:26:32.075 --> 00:26:33.645
Saul is worried about power.

506
00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:37.285
Saul is worried about his enemies. Notice the language.

507
00:26:37.315 --> 00:26:41.285
It's always first person. It's my enemies. His enemies.

508
00:26:41.315 --> 00:26:42.565
It's all about Saul.

509
00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:47.645
Saul is worried about position, reputation, power,

510
00:26:49.685 --> 00:26:51.505
the people he is gonna get vengeance against.

511
00:26:53.565 --> 00:26:55.185
Do you know what it's not about With Saul?

512
00:26:56.825 --> 00:26:59.055
Faith in God.

513
00:27:00.305 --> 00:27:05.135
Faith however matters most Jonathan's relationship

514
00:27:05.135 --> 00:27:07.255
with God contrasts against Saul

515
00:27:07.395 --> 00:27:09.655
and reminds us that position doesn't matter.

516
00:27:10.205 --> 00:27:13.465
Most money doesn't matter.

517
00:27:14.255 --> 00:27:18.425
Most enemies don't matter most.

518
00:27:19.405 --> 00:27:22.105
The fear of others or the respect of others does not matter.

519
00:27:22.495 --> 00:27:25.915
Most victory does not matter.

520
00:27:26.105 --> 00:27:30.185
Most faith in the God

521
00:27:30.685 --> 00:27:32.545
who made us matters most.

522
00:27:33.045 --> 00:27:34.945
You see, Jonathan is presented

523
00:27:35.005 --> 00:27:37.025
as a faithful follower of the Lord.

524
00:27:37.695 --> 00:27:38.825
Saul, not so much.

525
00:27:40.615 --> 00:27:43.235
So let's do a heart check when it comes to this question

526
00:27:43.235 --> 00:27:44.955
of faith, shall we?

527
00:27:46.005 --> 00:27:48.305
How are we doing on the lesson of faith matters most.

528
00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:52.185
Let's do a self inventory. I'm a teacher by training.

529
00:27:52.245 --> 00:27:55.385
And so one of the things that we like to do is assessments.

530
00:27:56.645 --> 00:27:58.145
If you were to assess your heart

531
00:27:58.145 --> 00:28:00.505
and your life, I mean honestly,

532
00:28:02.205 --> 00:28:05.215
what are those temptations that seem to rise

533
00:28:05.785 --> 00:28:07.415
above faith?

534
00:28:09.515 --> 00:28:12.505
We've just come from a Saturday, and I don't know about you,

535
00:28:13.565 --> 00:28:17.725
but, uh, it was a an extraordinarily challenging day

536
00:28:17.725 --> 00:28:18.725
for the state of Oklahoma.

537
00:28:19.425 --> 00:28:19.645
And

538
00:28:24.005 --> 00:28:26.965
sometimes when it's an extraordinarily challenging day

539
00:28:26.965 --> 00:28:29.205
for the state of Oklahoma on a Saturday,

540
00:28:30.145 --> 00:28:33.165
we come in here on a Sunday and we feel defeated.

541
00:28:34.605 --> 00:28:35.825
But can I ask you something?

542
00:28:35.925 --> 00:28:37.265
In the grand scheme of things,

543
00:28:38.865 --> 00:28:40.925
do defeats on the football field

544
00:28:42.315 --> 00:28:43.975
defeat our faith?

545
00:28:44.995 --> 00:28:48.895
Come on. We get excited on a Saturday

546
00:28:49.755 --> 00:28:51.175
and we're somber on a Sunday,

547
00:28:52.855 --> 00:28:55.555
and maybe we need to do an assessment about which is most

548
00:28:55.555 --> 00:28:56.755
weighty in our lives.

549
00:28:58.125 --> 00:28:59.465
Can I get in your business a little bit?

550
00:28:59.565 --> 00:29:02.505
You can't fire me, so whatever, right?

551
00:29:03.275 --> 00:29:04.425
Which is most important.

552
00:29:07.075 --> 00:29:10.525
What we're trying to do, for instance, at OBU, is I'm trying

553
00:29:10.585 --> 00:29:14.365
to help our community understand faith matters most.

554
00:29:15.905 --> 00:29:20.565
Uh, be a doctor, be an engineer, uh, be an attorney,

555
00:29:21.385 --> 00:29:22.885
be a physical therapist, great.

556
00:29:22.945 --> 00:29:27.445
Do all of that. But as God uses you in those fields,

557
00:29:28.825 --> 00:29:32.035
live all of life with deep faith,

558
00:29:33.095 --> 00:29:35.115
strong hands, right?

559
00:29:35.505 --> 00:29:38.155
Full hearts, wise minds.

560
00:29:38.925 --> 00:29:43.125
Faith matters most faith animates our life.

561
00:29:43.375 --> 00:29:45.485
Faith, faith animates our work.

562
00:29:45.735 --> 00:29:49.365
Faith in Jesus, not in ourselves. Amen.

563
00:29:51.005 --> 00:29:54.875
Faith matters most. Here's the third lesson. I love that.

564
00:29:54.915 --> 00:29:56.475
I love this. This is, I'm gonna spend a little bit

565
00:29:56.475 --> 00:29:58.075
of time on this, so just hang with me.

566
00:29:59.355 --> 00:30:02.115
Religion can be a mask.

567
00:30:02.135 --> 00:30:05.555
Lesson number three, religion can be a mask.

568
00:30:05.935 --> 00:30:09.675
Now, I like this because it's so evocative

569
00:30:09.695 --> 00:30:10.795
of our current world.

570
00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:14.355
In verse 35, in this passage, one of the things

571
00:30:14.355 --> 00:30:16.715
that we note is Saul builds antar.

572
00:30:17.695 --> 00:30:21.475
Now, on the face of it, building an altar is a good thing.

573
00:30:22.795 --> 00:30:24.435
Whenever the saints of old encountered

574
00:30:24.495 --> 00:30:25.515
God, guess what they did?

575
00:30:25.665 --> 00:30:28.555
They built an altar to commemorate what God had done.

576
00:30:29.085 --> 00:30:32.075
Think about Abram, when he built an altar between Bethel

577
00:30:32.075 --> 00:30:35.835
and AI to commemorate God's guidance to the promised land.

578
00:30:36.455 --> 00:30:39.395
And there at the altar where he built that place

579
00:30:39.495 --> 00:30:41.315
and commemorated God's kindness

580
00:30:41.455 --> 00:30:44.035
and his graciousness, he called on the name of the Lord.

581
00:30:44.145 --> 00:30:48.755
Worship an altar is a beautiful thing.

582
00:30:50.135 --> 00:30:53.315
In those instances, altars are an expression

583
00:30:53.455 --> 00:30:57.115
of a deep relationship where God has proven, faithful

584
00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:59.355
to an individual or to a family.

585
00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:01.995
Altars are good.

586
00:31:04.455 --> 00:31:08.765
However, the altar here,

587
00:31:09.905 --> 00:31:11.175
we've got questions about it.

588
00:31:12.305 --> 00:31:13.605
Why is he building an altar?

589
00:31:15.275 --> 00:31:18.485
Well, in this context, we don't see a lot about his

590
00:31:19.695 --> 00:31:20.815
devotion to the Lord.

591
00:31:20.845 --> 00:31:24.955
Chapter 13, he's kind of doing some weird stuff.

592
00:31:24.955 --> 00:31:28.675
In chapter 13, the beginning of chapter 14 is Jonathan,

593
00:31:29.005 --> 00:31:31.955
who's going out in faithfulness, the beginning

594
00:31:32.055 --> 00:31:34.715
of our section today, verse 2024.

595
00:31:35.705 --> 00:31:39.475
Saul is more focused than anything on his vengeance.

596
00:31:40.735 --> 00:31:43.035
So why is he building an altar to God?

597
00:31:45.305 --> 00:31:47.045
It looks like, and this is the nature

598
00:31:47.045 --> 00:31:48.405
of biblical narrative, it's subtle.

599
00:31:49.395 --> 00:31:51.575
It shows an action and says, think about that.

600
00:31:52.825 --> 00:31:53.875
Well, let's think about this.

601
00:31:54.455 --> 00:31:57.125
Why is he building an altar to glorify?

602
00:31:57.225 --> 00:32:02.165
God doesn't look that way.

603
00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:06.255
It looks like he's building an altar to try

604
00:32:06.255 --> 00:32:09.155
and manipulate God so he can get his vengeance.

605
00:32:10.835 --> 00:32:12.415
He inquires of the priest

606
00:32:12.505 --> 00:32:14.695
after the priest says, you should do this.

607
00:32:16.055 --> 00:32:18.145
He's not really attuned to the things of God.

608
00:32:19.895 --> 00:32:21.715
And this is a great reminder for us

609
00:32:21.715 --> 00:32:25.315
that religion can oftentimes mask

610
00:32:26.735 --> 00:32:28.755
deeper sin issues in our lives.

611
00:32:31.005 --> 00:32:34.725
In fact, if you look at Saul's life in this passage,

612
00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:38.405
he tells his people that they shouldn't eat food.

613
00:32:39.905 --> 00:32:43.155
That's crazy. The law didn't demand this,

614
00:32:44.375 --> 00:32:48.035
didn't demand, uh, you know, self-denial of food.

615
00:32:49.825 --> 00:32:50.845
So what's he concerned about?

616
00:32:50.845 --> 00:32:53.285
He's certainly not concerned about the good of his soldiers.

617
00:32:54.815 --> 00:32:56.145
He's concerned about his vengeance.

618
00:32:56.775 --> 00:32:58.305
He's not the concerned about the good

619
00:32:58.325 --> 00:33:00.225
of God's name in God's glory.

620
00:33:00.245 --> 00:33:03.065
It looks like he's building an altar for his own name so

621
00:33:03.065 --> 00:33:05.625
that he can manipulate God and he can get his vengeance.

622
00:33:06.095 --> 00:33:07.465
He's concerned about himself.

623
00:33:07.815 --> 00:33:09.025
He's concerned about his kingdom.

624
00:33:09.415 --> 00:33:10.865
He's concerned about his vengeance,

625
00:33:12.465 --> 00:33:14.485
but he's not necessarily concerned about God.

626
00:33:16.365 --> 00:33:20.385
He uses religion as a mask to hide his intentions.

627
00:33:21.545 --> 00:33:23.105
Sacrifice alter inquiring of God,

628
00:33:23.105 --> 00:33:24.505
having a priest hanging around.

629
00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:27.285
These are all external things.

630
00:33:27.855 --> 00:33:30.765
Masks that hide his true worship.

631
00:33:32.445 --> 00:33:35.855
Saul, like many of us, worships at the altar of me,

632
00:33:37.035 --> 00:33:38.775
myself and I,

633
00:33:39.945 --> 00:33:43.325
and he's engaging that false worship in the midst

634
00:33:43.505 --> 00:33:44.885
of the people of God.

635
00:33:46.275 --> 00:33:50.625
It's pure evil. How does this happen where

636
00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:53.845
religion masks pure evil?

637
00:33:54.025 --> 00:33:56.695
How does that happen? I'm reminded

638
00:33:56.715 --> 00:33:58.615
of a psychologist called M Scott p

639
00:33:58.635 --> 00:34:00.655
and one of the things that he says is,

640
00:34:01.895 --> 00:34:03.425
many times in the life of a church

641
00:34:03.685 --> 00:34:04.745
or religious groups,

642
00:34:04.845 --> 00:34:07.425
you find just abhorrent things going on,

643
00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:09.625
but they look good from the outside.

644
00:34:09.685 --> 00:34:11.185
It, it just, it doesn't make any sense.

645
00:34:12.005 --> 00:34:13.905
But then because he is a Christian psychologist,

646
00:34:14.005 --> 00:34:15.785
he draws our attention to Lucifer.

647
00:34:16.005 --> 00:34:18.585
You remember Lucifer Wright, son of the morning,

648
00:34:18.845 --> 00:34:20.145
the other name for Satan,

649
00:34:20.645 --> 00:34:23.945
the angel who's rebelled against God gets defeated.

650
00:34:24.205 --> 00:34:27.825
You remember, do you remember what Lucifer looks like?

651
00:34:28.995 --> 00:34:32.285
Well, if you think about William Blake, that great poet, uh,

652
00:34:32.565 --> 00:34:34.685
American poet, he used to do these prints.

653
00:34:34.685 --> 00:34:35.925
And one of the things that he did,

654
00:34:36.025 --> 00:34:37.725
and I think I have a a picture of it,

655
00:34:38.525 --> 00:34:40.085
Lucifer, uh, there he is.

656
00:34:41.335 --> 00:34:44.065
He's beautiful, he's glorious.

657
00:34:44.175 --> 00:34:46.825
He's Linds, he's bright,

658
00:34:48.525 --> 00:34:49.625
and yet pure evil.

659
00:34:51.675 --> 00:34:53.495
Why? Because religion can mask.

660
00:34:53.635 --> 00:34:54.935
We put up this false front

661
00:34:55.235 --> 00:34:57.575
and friends, the church is not a perfect place.

662
00:34:57.645 --> 00:35:00.175
It's oftentimes not even the most beautiful

663
00:35:00.175 --> 00:35:01.895
place on the outside.

664
00:35:03.455 --> 00:35:07.025
It's a bunch of broken people recognizing we have desperate

665
00:35:07.055 --> 00:35:10.505
need and that me need is met in one person, Jesus.

666
00:35:11.565 --> 00:35:13.985
And so we can be honest. We can be open.

667
00:35:14.685 --> 00:35:16.225
We don't have to put up false fronts.

668
00:35:17.625 --> 00:35:21.795
Saul, on the other hand, is using religion as a mask

669
00:35:22.335 --> 00:35:23.515
to hide his sin.

670
00:35:24.495 --> 00:35:28.955
Lesson number four, God is greater.

671
00:35:31.875 --> 00:35:34.755
Jonathan recognizes that God is greater than a Philistine.

672
00:35:34.775 --> 00:35:37.035
He says, Hey, God is free to do whatever he wants.

673
00:35:37.125 --> 00:35:41.525
Wants God can deliver with a big army or a small group.

674
00:35:41.525 --> 00:35:43.685
Doesn't make any difference because God is greater.

675
00:35:45.245 --> 00:35:48.665
In verses one through 23, he di he demonstrates

676
00:35:48.665 --> 00:35:52.295
that God is greater, but Saul

677
00:35:53.855 --> 00:35:56.705
doesn't view God as greater.

678
00:35:58.345 --> 00:36:01.025
Jonathan. He believed God was greater than external

679
00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:02.505
threats, the Philistines.

680
00:36:03.635 --> 00:36:05.815
And when he's called out for eating honey,

681
00:36:06.195 --> 00:36:07.455
he says, I'm ready to die.

682
00:36:07.555 --> 00:36:12.345
Die. I don't care. He, he, he doesn't even think about it.

683
00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:15.065
Jonathan believed God was greater even

684
00:36:15.065 --> 00:36:16.225
than the opinion of his father.

685
00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:19.025
He believed that God was greater than anything,

686
00:36:19.095 --> 00:36:21.105
even in life and in death.

687
00:36:21.205 --> 00:36:23.025
Why? Because his relationship with God

688
00:36:23.445 --> 00:36:26.985
and the promises that God has given, proved to be true.

689
00:36:27.165 --> 00:36:30.335
He knew it. One scholar says it this way.

690
00:36:31.015 --> 00:36:33.895
Jonathan's faith filled actions had inter,

691
00:36:33.895 --> 00:36:36.775
inadvertently brought about the defeat of two great enemies

692
00:36:36.775 --> 00:36:37.815
of Yahweh's purposes.

693
00:36:38.155 --> 00:36:40.375
One external, the Philistines

694
00:36:40.995 --> 00:36:42.615
and one internal,

695
00:36:43.755 --> 00:36:46.195
a misguided king Saul.

696
00:36:46.895 --> 00:36:49.565
How true God is greater.

697
00:36:49.905 --> 00:36:52.805
We can trust in God's provision protection.

698
00:36:52.985 --> 00:36:55.005
We can trust in God's promises.

699
00:36:55.185 --> 00:36:57.645
We learn to trust that God is greater.

700
00:36:57.645 --> 00:37:01.645
Listen to me in relationship with God, not just coming

701
00:37:01.665 --> 00:37:04.245
to church on a Sunday, going through the motions,

702
00:37:04.265 --> 00:37:06.685
but not have a living relationship with God.

703
00:37:07.005 --> 00:37:08.765
Students, young people listen to me.

704
00:37:09.715 --> 00:37:13.115
Relationship with God is better than scrolling.

705
00:37:13.215 --> 00:37:16.885
The zombie scrolling that we do. It's better.

706
00:37:18.935 --> 00:37:19.955
He satisfies.

707
00:37:22.305 --> 00:37:25.805
He takes us on a journey that's so exciting, so surprising.

708
00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:32.115
God is greater. Lesson five.

709
00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:35.645
There's a difference between the interior,

710
00:37:36.585 --> 00:37:37.965
the exterior of life.

711
00:37:39.045 --> 00:37:41.535
When we look at how Saul is presented, we can't help

712
00:37:41.535 --> 00:37:44.055
but ask the question, what is going on inside

713
00:37:44.055 --> 00:37:46.015
of Saul externally?

714
00:37:46.045 --> 00:37:47.775
He's doing all the right thing, offering,

715
00:37:48.135 --> 00:37:49.655
sacrificing, quoting the Bible.

716
00:37:51.275 --> 00:37:54.655
And yet on the inside it is absolutely bereft.

717
00:37:55.435 --> 00:38:00.365
We see a difference between his interior life

718
00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:02.005
and his exterior life in terms

719
00:38:02.025 --> 00:38:04.285
of the two rash vows that he makes.

720
00:38:05.985 --> 00:38:09.015
Verse 24, 1 could no one can eat anything during the day

721
00:38:09.015 --> 00:38:10.055
or else they'll be cursed.

722
00:38:10.075 --> 00:38:11.575
Why? Because he wants his vengeance.

723
00:38:12.235 --> 00:38:13.375
He doesn't care about his people.

724
00:38:15.765 --> 00:38:17.985
The second rash vow, anybody who's sinned

725
00:38:17.985 --> 00:38:19.385
and presented, prevented,

726
00:38:19.485 --> 00:38:21.425
saw from hearing God will be killed.

727
00:38:21.455 --> 00:38:24.225
Even if it's Jonathan, his son, verse 39,

728
00:38:24.225 --> 00:38:25.745
he doesn't even care about his son, Jonathan.

729
00:38:26.825 --> 00:38:31.005
He cares about himself Deep inside.

730
00:38:33.435 --> 00:38:38.345
Saul has a problem. The wrong person is on the

731
00:38:38.345 --> 00:38:39.385
throne of his life.

732
00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:43.645
And friends, we can experience the same thing, can't we?

733
00:38:43.965 --> 00:38:45.725
I mean, it's church might as well be honest.

734
00:38:46.875 --> 00:38:48.545
Oftentimes, the throne

735
00:38:48.645 --> 00:38:52.465
of our lives has the wrong person on it.

736
00:38:53.885 --> 00:38:57.865
Job, money. That person that you're trying to pursue,

737
00:39:02.385 --> 00:39:05.805
the throne of your life is only suited for one king.

738
00:39:05.825 --> 00:39:06.845
And that's king Jesus.

739
00:39:10.355 --> 00:39:13.365
It's the interior. I love the way that the Book

740
00:39:13.365 --> 00:39:14.805
of Samuel gets at this.

741
00:39:15.665 --> 00:39:16.725
We look at the outward,

742
00:39:17.385 --> 00:39:21.055
but it's God that looks on the heart.

743
00:39:23.125 --> 00:39:24.985
As God looks on our hearts this morning,

744
00:39:25.785 --> 00:39:28.245
what's going on on the interior of our lives?

745
00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:31.285
And maybe today, God is calling us

746
00:39:32.145 --> 00:39:34.645
to have some house cleaning on the inside.

747
00:39:35.445 --> 00:39:37.155
Maybe you need to lay some things down.

748
00:39:38.135 --> 00:39:40.035
For some of us in this room, it may mean that we need

749
00:39:40.035 --> 00:39:43.235
to step across the line of faith for the first time,

750
00:39:44.395 --> 00:39:48.695
turn from our sins and turn to King Jesus.

751
00:39:50.375 --> 00:39:51.835
Get the inner life right.

752
00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:58.595
Lesson six, spiritual blindness is real.

753
00:40:00.205 --> 00:40:01.985
Now, there's a couple of things

754
00:40:01.985 --> 00:40:03.905
that we need to really focus on.

755
00:40:03.935 --> 00:40:05.665
Like in verses 29 through 30.

756
00:40:06.015 --> 00:40:08.825
What Jonathan says is, um, in verse 29,

757
00:40:09.125 --> 00:40:11.545
my father has troubled this land.

758
00:40:11.545 --> 00:40:13.665
That language of trouble shows up in another

759
00:40:13.665 --> 00:40:14.705
place in the Old Testament.

760
00:40:14.705 --> 00:40:17.865
Ready? Joshua Chapter seven. Anybody know your Bible?

761
00:40:18.445 --> 00:40:22.075
Joshua chapter seven. It's the story of Aiken.

762
00:40:23.055 --> 00:40:24.405
Aiken sinned against God

763
00:40:25.185 --> 00:40:26.845
and it caused trouble for himself,

764
00:40:28.315 --> 00:40:30.855
his family, and for Israel.

765
00:40:30.855 --> 00:40:33.535
They commemorated that place where Aiken sin

766
00:40:33.555 --> 00:40:35.895
by calling it aor trouble.

767
00:40:37.525 --> 00:40:38.855
Saul uses that verb here.

768
00:40:40.085 --> 00:40:43.855
It's like Saul is saying, oh man, I mean, Jonathan's saying,

769
00:40:44.045 --> 00:40:47.175
Saul, my dad has a cord.

770
00:40:48.465 --> 00:40:51.515
The entire land here, that's intentional.

771
00:40:52.565 --> 00:40:56.225
And it shows us something about the interior life of Saul

772
00:40:56.225 --> 00:40:57.425
and what's wrong, what's wrong with Saul?

773
00:40:57.495 --> 00:40:58.825
It's not that he is a bad guy.

774
00:41:00.015 --> 00:41:00.705
He's living in,

775
00:41:04.425 --> 00:41:05.075
he's blind.

776
00:41:05.255 --> 00:41:06.755
He doesn't even understand what he's doing.

777
00:41:06.945 --> 00:41:10.515
He's causing trouble for everyone around him.

778
00:41:10.895 --> 00:41:15.385
And he's blind to it. He can't see it.

779
00:41:17.025 --> 00:41:20.125
In verse 37, there's there, there's a really que uh,

780
00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:24.985
big question about, uh, why, why doesn't God answer

781
00:41:25.655 --> 00:41:28.925
when Saul asks God didn't answer?

782
00:41:29.065 --> 00:41:30.685
Why? Why doesn't he answer?

783
00:41:32.535 --> 00:41:36.325
And he's throwing the rum in the th casting lots, trying

784
00:41:36.325 --> 00:41:39.205
to figure out who's made the who's, who's the problem here?

785
00:41:41.955 --> 00:41:44.855
And he's gonna kill whoever the problem is,

786
00:41:44.855 --> 00:41:46.255
even if it's own son, right?

787
00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:49.965
But the reality is the text is being so subtle here.

788
00:41:50.505 --> 00:41:53.375
The problem is Saul,

789
00:41:55.375 --> 00:41:57.705
he's about himself, not about God.

790
00:41:59.265 --> 00:42:02.455
He's a problem, not his son, Jonathan,

791
00:42:02.795 --> 00:42:04.175
so much so listen to this.

792
00:42:04.795 --> 00:42:06.415
The king has uttered an oath.

793
00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:09.935
And usually in the ancient world,

794
00:42:10.005 --> 00:42:12.775
when a king says something, what he says goes,

795
00:42:13.965 --> 00:42:15.185
but look what happens.

796
00:42:18.845 --> 00:42:23.575
The people, they contravene the king's command.

797
00:42:23.715 --> 00:42:25.775
Why? Because it's not a good command.

798
00:42:28.155 --> 00:42:30.335
And the text is showing us that the king

799
00:42:30.365 --> 00:42:33.455
that they need is not Saul.

800
00:42:35.605 --> 00:42:37.485
Unbelievable. He's blind.

801
00:42:38.665 --> 00:42:42.555
Have you ever seen the story or the cartoon?

802
00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:47.375
Where's Waldo Etsy's now doing these commercials, right?

803
00:42:47.475 --> 00:42:51.665
And Waldo's back, right? Where's Waldo? Where's Waldo?

804
00:42:52.015 --> 00:42:53.865
Well, it's hard because he's always there,

805
00:42:53.865 --> 00:42:54.905
but you can never see him.

806
00:42:56.145 --> 00:43:00.795
Sometimes. That is how it is with God. God's present.

807
00:43:00.895 --> 00:43:05.075
We just don't see him. That's Saul. God's present.

808
00:43:05.545 --> 00:43:08.735
Saul can't see him. Where's Waldo? Where's the Lord?

809
00:43:09.085 --> 00:43:10.335
Saul can't see him. He's blind.

810
00:43:11.625 --> 00:43:15.605
He needs to have his spiritual eyesight regained.

811
00:43:16.285 --> 00:43:19.045
And as we know, only Jesus can do that.

812
00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:24.645
Spiritual blindness is real. Final lesson, very simple.

813
00:43:25.755 --> 00:43:28.885
What I began with is where I leave us.

814
00:43:29.545 --> 00:43:32.045
The story of one and two Samuel is really about the

815
00:43:32.045 --> 00:43:33.565
king that Israel needs.

816
00:43:33.595 --> 00:43:36.755
It's the king we need. And who is that?

817
00:43:37.675 --> 00:43:41.525
Well, in this passage we see it's certainly not Saul

818
00:43:42.225 --> 00:43:43.405
as we'll discover later.

819
00:43:43.475 --> 00:43:46.085
It's not gonna be Jonathan because he dies with Saul.

820
00:43:47.315 --> 00:43:50.775
Who is it? Well, it's David, not as you go through the book

821
00:43:50.775 --> 00:43:55.355
of Second Samuel, the king we

822
00:43:55.355 --> 00:43:57.545
need is coming.

823
00:43:58.745 --> 00:44:01.915
His name is Jesus. He's the king

824
00:44:01.935 --> 00:44:03.875
who provides perfect righteousness,

825
00:44:04.145 --> 00:44:06.595
perfect peace, perfect joy.

826
00:44:06.975 --> 00:44:09.515
He forgives our sins. He renews our lives.

827
00:44:09.775 --> 00:44:11.875
He gives us life and life to the fullest.

828
00:44:12.095 --> 00:44:13.435
That's the king that we need.

829
00:44:13.525 --> 00:44:15.315
Who's on the throne of your heart and your life?

830
00:44:16.385 --> 00:44:19.195
Some of you need to turn from your sin today

831
00:44:19.615 --> 00:44:20.475
and turn to Jesus.
