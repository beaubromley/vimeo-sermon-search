00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:35.045
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:36.605
Uh, anybody else tired?

3
00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:41.125
Uh, I think if you see anybody wearing these shirts today,

4
00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:43.885
they probably are, uh, kids and leaders included.

5
00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:46.445
I actually slept through my alarm this morning,

6
00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:49.485
so it's been, I'm dragging

7
00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:51.685
and kind of skating around this morning pretty quickly.

8
00:00:51.865 --> 00:00:53.485
But listen, it was, it was powerful

9
00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:55.605
to see God at work all week.

10
00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:58.005
It really was an honor to be a part of it,

11
00:00:58.005 --> 00:00:59.085
to watch student leaders

12
00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:02.245
and adult leaders to watch the kids be responsive

13
00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:04.005
and engaged from the jump Monday night.

14
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.885
They were ready to worship and engage in God's word

15
00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:10.045
and so special and a blessing to be a part of it.

16
00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.925
Well, today we come to the penultimate sermon

17
00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:17.685
of this series called Realigned through Romans 12.

18
00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.285
If you don't know what that word means,

19
00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:20.925
that means next week is the last one.

20
00:01:20.925 --> 00:01:22.205
This is the next to last one.

21
00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:25.525
Uh, and if you're new to our church, that means one thing

22
00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:28.765
that as we finish out a long series, you'll see some

23
00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:31.565
of us dressed up, uh, to honor the time

24
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:34.165
that we've spent in a long series like this.

25
00:01:34.665 --> 00:01:36.205
You don't have to participate if you don't want to,

26
00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:37.885
but it just means don't be shocked

27
00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:38.925
when you show up next week.

28
00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:41.045
Like, is there a funeral today? No, it's okay.

29
00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:43.165
We got, uh, just the end of a series.

30
00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:47.765
That's what we're doing. But today we come to

31
00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.365
what is possibly the hardest command

32
00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:52.885
in all of Romans 12.

33
00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:57.715
Remember, we're seeking to realign our lives

34
00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:00.035
to the perfect standard of Jesus.

35
00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:05.435
Now he shows us what a life lived perfectly looks like.

36
00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:08.035
And so what we've also seen every week is

37
00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:10.595
how far from this standard we actually are.

38
00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:13.755
We measure off of different standards and different things

39
00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:15.755
and, and we don't match it.

40
00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:18.075
And so we've been challenged

41
00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:21.075
and convicted every week as we see how far off of

42
00:02:21.075 --> 00:02:22.115
that standard we are,

43
00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:25.595
but also in some way it feels like all

44
00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:29.875
of them have been building to this one today, that

45
00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:33.605
they've gotten progressively harder

46
00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:35.685
as they've dug deeper into our souls,

47
00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:36.725
they've pushed us further.

48
00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:41.285
All leading to today where we're talking about

49
00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:46.525
loving your enemies, like those who oppose you,

50
00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:48.845
those who are against you, those

51
00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:51.875
who hurt you, how do you love them?

52
00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:57.845
And, and how did Jesus model that perfectly for us?

53
00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:00.845
What can we learn from how he did it

54
00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:03.805
that we can apply today?

55
00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:06.755
And here's why this is so important

56
00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:10.355
because maybe more than any of the other ones,

57
00:03:11.945 --> 00:03:15.355
this command best reveals the transformation

58
00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:18.075
that God has brought in your heart.

59
00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:23.805
Like this is what we talked about

60
00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:25.565
with the kids all week at camp.

61
00:03:25.675 --> 00:03:28.725
This, this very thing that if we stop

62
00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:32.845
and reflect on what God has done for us,

63
00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:36.265
How can we not turn around

64
00:03:36.325 --> 00:03:38.065
and love others, including our enemies?

65
00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:43.265
Because the reality is every single one of us from birth

66
00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:46.425
on our own, apart from any intervention by God,

67
00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:50.905
we are all enemies of God due to our sin against him.

68
00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:53.385
Like we don't deserve his love.

69
00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:56.905
We deserve his wrath, we deserve his judgment.

70
00:03:59.485 --> 00:04:01.705
And yet Romans five, eight,

71
00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:07.085
while we were still sinners, his enemies,

72
00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:09.315
Christ died for us.

73
00:04:11.225 --> 00:04:12.835
Like that's stunning, isn't it?

74
00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:16.355
Like that reality of him loving his enemies, his his,

75
00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:18.795
his ones who are opposed to He loves us.

76
00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:23.035
He's, he's just overwhelming to us to think about that.

77
00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:29.685
And so as we get into this today, keep that gospel

78
00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:32.505
at the forefront of your mind.

79
00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:35.535
Like that is the foundation

80
00:04:35.595 --> 00:04:37.175
for everything else we'll talk about today.

81
00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:41.375
That's the foundation of what we're gonna see, of how

82
00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:42.895
to love our enemies and how to apply all

83
00:04:42.895 --> 00:04:45.055
of this really in Romans 12.

84
00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:48.495
And so this is hard. It's difficult.

85
00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:51.095
So let's pray and ask God for help.

86
00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:52.695
Lord, we come humbly

87
00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:57.335
before you asking you in your grace

88
00:04:57.355 --> 00:05:01.575
and mercy that you shine through your word,

89
00:05:01.575 --> 00:05:03.655
that you speak, get me outta the way.

90
00:05:03.655 --> 00:05:06.015
And you speak through what you've written down

91
00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:07.175
and the importance of it.

92
00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:10.895
And in spite of the difficulty of it, God, we would see

93
00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:15.115
and hear and not just be hearers of it,

94
00:05:15.135 --> 00:05:16.595
but doers of the word as well.

95
00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:22.555
Lord, protect us from the enemy who's gonna throw defeaters

96
00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:24.515
in our minds all day about this.

97
00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:30.795
Keep us just focused on seeing you

98
00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:34.725
and your word today In this maybe most

99
00:05:36.405 --> 00:05:41.175
critical command to show what your work is in our lives.

100
00:05:42.015 --> 00:05:45.475
Help us God, in Jesus' name. Amen.

101
00:05:47.835 --> 00:05:50.775
So we'll be back in Romans 12 as we've been all summer.

102
00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:51.975
So turn there with me

103
00:05:51.995 --> 00:05:54.295
and we're actually gonna look at a couple verses

104
00:05:54.995 --> 00:05:56.575
in the chapter over the last few weeks.

105
00:05:56.665 --> 00:05:59.525
We've looked at phrases from verses.

106
00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.445
But this one we're gonna see actually a couple whole

107
00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:03.005
verses in this.

108
00:06:03.205 --> 00:06:04.205
'cause Paul had a lot to say.

109
00:06:05.145 --> 00:06:07.405
In fact, this is the thing he talks about the most in this

110
00:06:07.405 --> 00:06:09.365
entire section, is this idea

111
00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:11.965
of loving your enemies maybe 'cause it's that important.

112
00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:15.635
But we're gonna start in verse 14.

113
00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.755
There's one radical command right off the bat here.

114
00:06:18.755 --> 00:06:20.035
We'll see more as we get later.

115
00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:22.115
But just verse 14 for now, watch this.

116
00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:26.495
Bless those who persecute you.

117
00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:29.775
Bless and do not curse them.

118
00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:34.075
Okay, so let's just remember the context of

119
00:06:34.075 --> 00:06:35.635
what was happening back in Rome

120
00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:37.795
that would've precipitated Paul writing this

121
00:06:37.815 --> 00:06:38.995
to the Roman Christians.

122
00:06:40.195 --> 00:06:42.635
Remember that the early church was not popular,

123
00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:44.355
nor was it prevalent.

124
00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:47.595
Like there weren't church buildings on every corner.

125
00:06:47.935 --> 00:06:50.675
It wasn't culturally acceptable to be a Christian back then.

126
00:06:50.735 --> 00:06:52.035
In fact, they thought you were a cult

127
00:06:52.135 --> 00:06:54.395
or they thought you were trying to take over Rome

128
00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:55.595
and overthrow Caesar.

129
00:06:55.695 --> 00:06:57.355
And so they were not for you,

130
00:06:58.765 --> 00:07:00.755
which means they would've been persecuted,

131
00:07:00.815 --> 00:07:02.115
not actually celebrated.

132
00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:06.555
They would've been called names they would've been laughed

133
00:07:06.615 --> 00:07:09.595
at, they would've been probably fired from jobs thrown in

134
00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:14.475
prison, possibly even physically harmed, merely for saying,

135
00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:16.435
I identify with Jesus Christ.

136
00:07:19.215 --> 00:07:21.745
They would've been experiencing the worst evil

137
00:07:22.335 --> 00:07:26.265
that the enemy could throw at them through the pagan world

138
00:07:26.265 --> 00:07:27.265
that they lived in.

139
00:07:30.965 --> 00:07:33.505
Yet this is how the Christian life turns

140
00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:35.225
that world upside down

141
00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:39.365
where the world says get even.

142
00:07:39.895 --> 00:07:44.525
Jesus says, get blessing. The world says get even.

143
00:07:44.735 --> 00:07:47.125
Jesus says, no. Get about blessing. Go bless people.

144
00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:50.845
Go bless them. We actually get our word eulogy from this

145
00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:52.325
word for blessing.

146
00:07:54.405 --> 00:07:56.125
What's a eulogy at a funeral, right?

147
00:07:56.235 --> 00:07:59.245
It's you saying honorable things kind,

148
00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.005
blessing things about the person who's died.

149
00:08:02.105 --> 00:08:04.725
That's a eulogy. That's the word we get it from here.

150
00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:08.765
The blessing that he's saying we should give to those

151
00:08:09.185 --> 00:08:11.065
who persecute us.

152
00:08:13.595 --> 00:08:14.815
So notice what he's saying.

153
00:08:16.325 --> 00:08:19.015
He's not saying, just be polite to your enemies.

154
00:08:21.285 --> 00:08:22.585
Be nice to your enemies.

155
00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:28.535
Like this is the explosive power of the gospel

156
00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:33.855
entering into a fallen world where instead of cursing

157
00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:37.375
or attacking your enemies, you are

158
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.575
to bless your enemies.

159
00:08:42.325 --> 00:08:46.885
That is radical. That is completely counter-cultural.

160
00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:53.445
And notice it's not just bless those enemies

161
00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:55.205
who are actually nice to you at that moment, moment.

162
00:08:57.015 --> 00:09:00.065
It's when they are per, when they are persecuting you.

163
00:09:00.715 --> 00:09:02.705
Bless those who per, that's an active word.

164
00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:05.625
Bless those who are persecuting you right now.

165
00:09:05.685 --> 00:09:09.905
He says, we're not to curse them back.

166
00:09:09.905 --> 00:09:10.825
We're to bless them back.

167
00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:14.945
And here's what that does.

168
00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:19.825
When you bless someone back who's persecuting you, it

169
00:09:20.345 --> 00:09:24.345
reverses their hatred, blessing.

170
00:09:24.345 --> 00:09:26.345
Instead of cursing when someone hates you,

171
00:09:26.345 --> 00:09:29.505
someone persecutes you and you, you don't curse them back.

172
00:09:29.505 --> 00:09:30.785
You instead bless them back.

173
00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:34.505
It reverses the hatred that they've tried to attack you

174
00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:36.305
with it reverses it back.

175
00:09:36.455 --> 00:09:39.625
What they thought would get to you

176
00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.055
actually comes back to them as blessing.

177
00:09:45.205 --> 00:09:46.415
Like they thought they'd get at you,

178
00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:47.455
they thought this would work.

179
00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:48.895
This would be the thing. This would be the one

180
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.215
that that takes 'em out.

181
00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.535
This would be the one that really gets that Christian down.

182
00:09:52.795 --> 00:09:55.495
And what they get in response is blessing.

183
00:09:59.535 --> 00:10:02.145
When someone cuts you down, you build them up.

184
00:10:04.455 --> 00:10:06.145
When someone slanders your name,

185
00:10:06.485 --> 00:10:07.945
you speak well of their name.

186
00:10:10.155 --> 00:10:12.965
When someone attacks you, you love them.

187
00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:18.045
Well, Like this, this is,

188
00:10:18.155 --> 00:10:20.485
this is completely radical.

189
00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:25.695
I was trying to think of a way to illustrate this and,

190
00:10:25.715 --> 00:10:27.535
and this is probably a terrible illustration,

191
00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:29.695
but it's kind of like the reverse card in the game.

192
00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:33.255
Uno, you know like how

193
00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:34.975
that game simply works, right?

194
00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:37.015
It's the order of play is coming clockwise.

195
00:10:37.015 --> 00:10:39.495
You play the reverse card and it goes back counterclockwise

196
00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:42.535
and, and, and simple, right?

197
00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:44.735
This is not complicated. It's not hard to understand.

198
00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:46.975
Here's the thing about it though.

199
00:10:47.075 --> 00:10:50.975
It actually blesses the next person, the person next to you.

200
00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:55.215
And I'm probably way over analyzing this simple card game in

201
00:10:55.215 --> 00:10:56.535
thinking of this way, but I'm trying

202
00:10:56.535 --> 00:10:57.655
to figure out how to illustrate this.

203
00:10:58.275 --> 00:10:59.655
But, but imagine this, right?

204
00:10:59.655 --> 00:11:02.255
So it's coming your way and you play the reverse card

205
00:11:02.555 --> 00:11:04.815
and the person next to you, it blesses them

206
00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:08.055
by giving them an opportunity to play another card instead

207
00:11:08.055 --> 00:11:10.375
of waiting all the way around the circle to

208
00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:11.855
where they have to play again.

209
00:11:13.595 --> 00:11:14.725
Okay? That didn't work. All right?

210
00:11:14.725 --> 00:11:19.365
So when we bless our persecutor,

211
00:11:20.035 --> 00:11:21.725
it's the ultimate reverse card.

212
00:11:23.075 --> 00:11:24.125
What it does is it takes

213
00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:26.845
what they thought was gonna hurt you and it reverses them

214
00:11:27.225 --> 00:11:30.845
and it it takes the the hate and it turns into blessing.

215
00:11:31.475 --> 00:11:34.405
It's the Christians' war cry against evil

216
00:11:37.105 --> 00:11:40.915
Because when we bless our persecutor, we are proving

217
00:11:41.305 --> 00:11:42.475
that we are sons

218
00:11:42.475 --> 00:11:43.795
and daughters of the one

219
00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:45.795
who loved us when we were his enemies.

220
00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:48.675
Like that's the reversal of this.

221
00:11:48.745 --> 00:11:51.235
It's not like it's it's I for an eye thing anymore.

222
00:11:51.465 --> 00:11:54.125
It's no, I am stead completely different now.

223
00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:56.845
I've loved you like Christ has loved me.

224
00:11:57.155 --> 00:11:58.525
It's just illustrating

225
00:11:58.525 --> 00:12:01.805
what Jesus did while hanging on the cross.

226
00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:06.205
He didn't curse those who nailed him to the cross.

227
00:12:06.235 --> 00:12:08.565
What did he do? He blessed them.

228
00:12:08.565 --> 00:12:11.245
He said, father, forgive them

229
00:12:12.345 --> 00:12:13.485
for they know not what they do.

230
00:12:15.705 --> 00:12:18.885
He didn't curse back. He blessed back.

231
00:12:20.645 --> 00:12:21.815
Like that's the standard.

232
00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:24.175
If you think, man, I I'm good at that.

233
00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:27.175
I got that one taken care of. I love my enemy's real well.

234
00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:31.075
If they would be killing you, could you look at them

235
00:12:31.075 --> 00:12:32.075
and say, I forgive you.

236
00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:35.955
Like Stephen in Acts seven who's getting stoned

237
00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:37.035
for merely standing up

238
00:12:37.035 --> 00:12:39.755
and saying, Jesus is Lord, he's getting killed.

239
00:12:39.975 --> 00:12:41.435
And as he's doing it, he's looking

240
00:12:41.455 --> 00:12:42.995
and saying, God forgive them.

241
00:12:44.365 --> 00:12:46.515
Could you say that That's the standard.

242
00:12:47.505 --> 00:12:49.775
Could you be living that out? That's the standard.

243
00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:55.605
So I think we're pretty far from that most of us.

244
00:12:57.455 --> 00:13:00.075
But that's our prayer is that this is the standard

245
00:13:00.225 --> 00:13:04.075
that shows up daily for us in huge ways.

246
00:13:04.445 --> 00:13:07.875
Maybe you would be persecuted and and killed for your faith,

247
00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:13.675
but also in small ways every day as you face

248
00:13:14.515 --> 00:13:15.835
hardship or pain or suffering

249
00:13:15.855 --> 00:13:18.555
or hurt from someone, that you can love them

250
00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:21.075
instead of cursing them back.

251
00:13:25.585 --> 00:13:26.765
So it reverses their hatred.

252
00:13:26.865 --> 00:13:29.125
But actually Romans 12 goes further with this.

253
00:13:30.675 --> 00:13:33.685
Look at verses 17 and 19 now

254
00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:38.175
and follow this with me starting in verse 17.

255
00:13:41.115 --> 00:13:43.435
Repay no one evil for evil,

256
00:13:44.695 --> 00:13:45.995
but give thought to do

257
00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:48.635
what is honorable in the sight of all.

258
00:13:49.865 --> 00:13:53.275
Now verse 19, Beloved never

259
00:13:53.835 --> 00:13:54.995
avenge yourselves,

260
00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:59.595
but leave it to the wrath of God for it is written,

261
00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:00.955
vengeance is mine.

262
00:14:01.275 --> 00:14:03.515
I will repay, says the Lord.

263
00:14:06.905 --> 00:14:09.205
Now we've talked a lot about pride

264
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.885
and humility over the last couple weeks.

265
00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:15.885
This strikes at the very heart of our pride.

266
00:14:17.555 --> 00:14:21.855
The fact that we feel like we need to settle the score,

267
00:14:23.455 --> 00:14:24.945
that we need to make it equitable.

268
00:14:24.945 --> 00:14:26.625
If we're hurt, then we need to hurt back.

269
00:14:26.935 --> 00:14:31.875
It's gotta be fair. That is a prideful heart.

270
00:14:35.305 --> 00:14:36.725
Now, before we go further, I need

271
00:14:36.725 --> 00:14:37.965
to make a little side note here

272
00:14:37.965 --> 00:14:39.165
and to make a clarification,

273
00:14:41.105 --> 00:14:43.415
we're not talking in this about justice

274
00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.975
by the state, the government.

275
00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.815
'cause in the very next chapter, chapter 13,

276
00:14:48.845 --> 00:14:52.325
Paul talks about the sword meaning justice,

277
00:14:53.755 --> 00:14:56.845
that God has given that to the state, to the government

278
00:14:57.585 --> 00:15:00.165
to bring peace and to keep peace

279
00:15:00.385 --> 00:15:04.005
and to have legal standards and to bring justice

280
00:15:04.385 --> 00:15:05.925
and to protect people.

281
00:15:06.265 --> 00:15:07.965
That's definitely part of it.

282
00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:13.745
But we're talking about here today is personal vengeance.

283
00:15:15.235 --> 00:15:17.665
We're talking about personal responses

284
00:15:19.175 --> 00:15:21.915
to slights, to persecution, to hurts.

285
00:15:22.975 --> 00:15:24.795
How do we respond individually?

286
00:15:27.325 --> 00:15:30.655
Well, if you just followed what Romans 12 said,

287
00:15:30.885 --> 00:15:35.645
it's very clear We are not to repay evil for evil.

288
00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:39.385
We are not to avenge ourselves.

289
00:15:41.225 --> 00:15:44.365
We are not to try and settle the score ourselves.

290
00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:50.105
And notice it's not most of the time

291
00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:55.655
like it's only true in small stuff,

292
00:15:55.675 --> 00:15:57.175
but man, when it's really bad

293
00:15:58.035 --> 00:16:00.095
or when they deserve it, then you can take revenge.

294
00:16:01.365 --> 00:16:03.505
But most of the time you're not supposed to take No, no.

295
00:16:03.525 --> 00:16:07.035
Did you see it? We are not to take vengeance.

296
00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:11.305
We are not to seek revenge ever.

297
00:16:12.955 --> 00:16:15.165
That that's what it says. You can't make anything out of

298
00:16:15.165 --> 00:16:16.565
that other than what that is like.

299
00:16:16.565 --> 00:16:19.565
You are not to take vengeance. Why?

300
00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:24.465
He says it because vengeance belongs to God alone.

301
00:16:26.835 --> 00:16:28.815
That's what Paul does here in verse 19.

302
00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:32.695
He cites Deuteronomy 32 35.

303
00:16:33.205 --> 00:16:35.735
This is from the Old Testament. This is from the law of God.

304
00:16:35.735 --> 00:16:39.015
This was God revealing his character, revealing his nature,

305
00:16:39.195 --> 00:16:41.535
saying This is who I am, this is what I'm about.

306
00:16:41.915 --> 00:16:45.735
And God said the same thing that we have quoted here.

307
00:16:45.915 --> 00:16:50.095
He said it vengeance is mine. I will repay.

308
00:16:51.755 --> 00:16:55.015
God owns it. God takes it away from anybody

309
00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:56.175
else and says it's mine.

310
00:16:56.575 --> 00:17:01.485
I own vengeance. I will be the one to repay.

311
00:17:01.485 --> 00:17:04.725
That means God will settle every account,

312
00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:10.895
every wrong will be made right

313
00:17:14.965 --> 00:17:16.225
either at the cross

314
00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:19.985
where Christ bore God's full wrath for sin.

315
00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.465
That's where justice came.

316
00:17:21.725 --> 00:17:25.585
Or maybe in this life that person reaps what they sow

317
00:17:25.775 --> 00:17:28.625
that may be justice or for sure in hell

318
00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:30.665
where the unrepentant will face the full wrath

319
00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:31.665
of God forever.

320
00:17:33.885 --> 00:17:37.615
Justice will be done. Every wrong will be made right?

321
00:17:37.615 --> 00:17:42.415
Justice will come. And when we trust that, here's the point.

322
00:17:43.325 --> 00:17:47.375
Leaving vengeance to God trusts his sovereign justice.

323
00:17:48.245 --> 00:17:52.905
That That he is sovereign. We trust God.

324
00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:55.865
We trust that you're going to bring justice in your time

325
00:17:55.865 --> 00:17:58.665
and your way at your call

326
00:18:00.385 --> 00:18:03.905
sovereignty that he will and he can.

327
00:18:07.635 --> 00:18:10.805
When We leave vengeance to God, it trusts his

328
00:18:11.315 --> 00:18:12.565
sovereign justice.

329
00:18:16.005 --> 00:18:17.825
Now what I'm about to say is gonna get kind of hard

330
00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:22.485
when we take revenge into our own hands.

331
00:18:24.705 --> 00:18:25.805
We are playing God.

332
00:18:29.635 --> 00:18:34.535
We're saying to God, I don't trust you

333
00:18:34.535 --> 00:18:37.375
to handle this, so I'm gonna handle it.

334
00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:43.025
God, I don't trust your timing on this.

335
00:18:43.225 --> 00:18:44.225
I think it should happen quicker.

336
00:18:44.505 --> 00:18:46.105
I think it should happen now.

337
00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:47.745
And so I'm gonna take care of it.

338
00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:50.425
I don't trust you enough to deal with it.

339
00:18:52.945 --> 00:18:55.835
Like you see how crazy that sounds when we say it that way.

340
00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:57.315
But isn't that what we do?

341
00:19:02.165 --> 00:19:04.175
Because here's the, here's the question.

342
00:19:04.315 --> 00:19:09.135
Do we have perfect knowledge of the entire situation to

343
00:19:09.135 --> 00:19:11.335
where we would make a perfect decision on how to handle it?

344
00:19:12.815 --> 00:19:16.015
No. Do we have

345
00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:19.695
perfect knowledge of what's coming around the corner?

346
00:19:19.765 --> 00:19:21.975
Like what's gonna happen in the next minute,

347
00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:23.495
the next hour, the next day?

348
00:19:23.555 --> 00:19:25.135
We have no idea what's coming.

349
00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:31.005
Do we have perfect knowledge of what's actually best

350
00:19:31.145 --> 00:19:33.205
for everyone involved in every situation?

351
00:19:35.095 --> 00:19:39.885
No. So we should leave

352
00:19:39.885 --> 00:19:43.545
vengeance to God, the one

353
00:19:43.545 --> 00:19:47.305
who has perfect knowledge, the one who knows

354
00:19:47.305 --> 00:19:49.945
what his plan is and what is coming around the next corner.

355
00:19:50.325 --> 00:19:53.065
The one who knows what's best for every single person,

356
00:19:53.475 --> 00:19:55.745
every situation, he knows all those things.

357
00:19:55.805 --> 00:19:57.745
He is sovereign. He knows all.

358
00:19:58.045 --> 00:20:02.385
And so when we list, when we release Our

359
00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:05.345
supposed right to revenge,

360
00:20:08.075 --> 00:20:11.135
we walk out of that prison of bitterness

361
00:20:13.275 --> 00:20:15.375
in full trust that God's gonna take care of it.

362
00:20:17.865 --> 00:20:18.985
'cause that's what bitterness is, right?

363
00:20:19.065 --> 00:20:22.305
I don't, I, I don't wanna release this in my heart towards

364
00:20:22.585 --> 00:20:25.665
somebody who's hurt me because I want them to pay.

365
00:20:28.195 --> 00:20:31.595
I want them to suffer because I suffered or I want that.

366
00:20:31.595 --> 00:20:32.875
That's, that's bitterness, right?

367
00:20:32.875 --> 00:20:34.595
It's holding onto that in my heart

368
00:20:34.595 --> 00:20:36.195
that I hope they get what they deserve.

369
00:20:36.495 --> 00:20:38.355
That's, that's a prison.

370
00:20:40.015 --> 00:20:43.795
If we could just release that in full trust

371
00:20:43.895 --> 00:20:46.075
of a sovereign just God

372
00:20:46.295 --> 00:20:50.215
and say, you've got this, God, you, you take care of this.

373
00:20:50.575 --> 00:20:51.655
I know you will. I know you.

374
00:20:51.955 --> 00:20:53.095
It may not be on my timing,

375
00:20:53.355 --> 00:20:55.295
it may not be when I could even see it happen,

376
00:20:55.595 --> 00:20:59.805
but I trust you and I'm free from

377
00:20:59.805 --> 00:21:01.165
what held me down before.

378
00:21:01.835 --> 00:21:06.515
When you entrust your pain

379
00:21:07.295 --> 00:21:10.955
to the perfect judge who sees all, who knows all

380
00:21:11.135 --> 00:21:14.515
who will make all things right, that is not weakness.

381
00:21:16.315 --> 00:21:20.165
That is strength. Because you're trusting in a,

382
00:21:21.105 --> 00:21:24.845
you have absolute confidence in a God who is sovereign

383
00:21:24.905 --> 00:21:28.565
and just that's strength, that's not weakness.

384
00:21:28.905 --> 00:21:30.845
That's not saying I, I don't wanna do anything about it.

385
00:21:31.025 --> 00:21:33.285
I'm just getting outta the way. No, it's, it's trust

386
00:21:34.145 --> 00:21:37.405
and that's strong in the kingdom of God.

387
00:21:40.865 --> 00:21:43.115
Just think about how Jesus modeled this for us.

388
00:21:45.925 --> 00:21:49.955
There was a principle in his day of an eye for an eye,

389
00:21:50.155 --> 00:21:53.595
a tooth for a tooth, this legalistic sense of justice

390
00:21:53.705 --> 00:21:55.755
that if they did this to you, you can do that back to them.

391
00:21:58.115 --> 00:22:00.545
Watch how he flipped that whole thing on its head.

392
00:22:02.165 --> 00:22:05.015
This is in the sermon on the Mount Matthew five verses

393
00:22:05.015 --> 00:22:06.215
38 through 48.

394
00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:08.015
Very familiar. You might have heard this stuff before,

395
00:22:08.015 --> 00:22:10.255
but just listen with the ears now of

396
00:22:10.255 --> 00:22:11.775
what we've been through so far.

397
00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:14.855
Jesus says, you've heard that it was said an eye

398
00:22:14.855 --> 00:22:16.255
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

399
00:22:16.715 --> 00:22:20.015
But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil.

400
00:22:20.635 --> 00:22:22.735
But if anyone slaps you on the right

401
00:22:22.735 --> 00:22:23.815
cheek, turn them the other.

402
00:22:24.005 --> 00:22:25.775
Also, if anyone would sue you

403
00:22:25.775 --> 00:22:28.495
and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.

404
00:22:28.795 --> 00:22:31.535
If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles,

405
00:22:32.445 --> 00:22:33.775
give to the one who begs from you.

406
00:22:33.955 --> 00:22:36.135
Do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.

407
00:22:38.075 --> 00:22:39.215
You have heard that it was said,

408
00:22:39.235 --> 00:22:41.255
you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.

409
00:22:42.825 --> 00:22:44.565
But I say to you, love your enemies

410
00:22:44.785 --> 00:22:48.405
and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be sons

411
00:22:48.405 --> 00:22:51.125
of your father who is in heaven, for he makes his son rise

412
00:22:51.125 --> 00:22:53.365
on the evil and on the good sends rain on the

413
00:22:53.365 --> 00:22:54.405
just and on the unjust.

414
00:22:54.945 --> 00:22:58.325
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?

415
00:22:59.065 --> 00:23:00.805
Do not even the tax collectors do the same.

416
00:23:01.875 --> 00:23:03.335
And if you greet only your brothers,

417
00:23:03.335 --> 00:23:04.695
what more are you doing than others?

418
00:23:05.755 --> 00:23:07.755
Do not even the gentiles do the same?

419
00:23:09.365 --> 00:23:10.585
You therefore must be perfect

420
00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:12.745
as your heavenly father is perfect.

421
00:23:16.445 --> 00:23:19.625
Does that not sound radical to our modern ears?

422
00:23:21.825 --> 00:23:23.235
Wait a second, listen, you're telling me

423
00:23:23.585 --> 00:23:27.075
that I I I shouldn't defend myself.

424
00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:30.355
Is that what Jesus is saying here?

425
00:23:31.435 --> 00:23:33.925
Here you're telling me I need to just give money away

426
00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:35.405
to people who are trying to steal from me.

427
00:23:35.405 --> 00:23:37.485
Is that what he's saying here? It sounds so radical

428
00:23:37.485 --> 00:23:41.245
because we have such, uh, we've marinated in this culture

429
00:23:41.785 --> 00:23:44.125
of justice and, and injustice and

430
00:23:44.125 --> 00:23:46.645
and fighting for what's yours and keeping yours

431
00:23:46.645 --> 00:23:49.165
and all this stuff and and when we've marinated that so long

432
00:23:49.165 --> 00:23:50.365
that this sounds so radical.

433
00:23:52.905 --> 00:23:55.325
But Jesus said this is the kingdom way.

434
00:24:01.005 --> 00:24:04.505
And Jesus not only taught about it, he lived it.

435
00:24:04.855 --> 00:24:08.305
This is how he loved his enemies,

436
00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:10.905
how he trusted his sovereign father.

437
00:24:11.015 --> 00:24:15.625
This is one Peter 2 21 through 23 says for

438
00:24:15.685 --> 00:24:16.825
to this you've been called

439
00:24:16.825 --> 00:24:20.585
because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example

440
00:24:20.925 --> 00:24:22.825
so that you might follow in his steps.

441
00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:27.785
He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth,

442
00:24:27.785 --> 00:24:30.145
meaning he didn't deserve anything he was getting.

443
00:24:31.525 --> 00:24:35.645
But when he was reviled, he did not revile in return

444
00:24:37.365 --> 00:24:39.775
when he suffered, he did not threaten

445
00:24:41.505 --> 00:24:44.445
but continued entrusting himself to him.

446
00:24:44.545 --> 00:24:46.165
Who judges justly

447
00:24:50.065 --> 00:24:52.515
Said, my father knows

448
00:24:52.865 --> 00:24:55.845
best he will judge.

449
00:24:56.385 --> 00:24:59.285
He will make it all right. I trust him.

450
00:25:02.255 --> 00:25:04.075
So while we may not understand it always

451
00:25:05.695 --> 00:25:07.915
and as hard as it can be to do

452
00:25:10.315 --> 00:25:12.565
leaving vengeance to God, trust

453
00:25:12.595 --> 00:25:15.045
that he will work it out way better than you

454
00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:19.205
and I ever could and you trying

455
00:25:19.205 --> 00:25:20.725
to work it out might actually get you in trouble.

456
00:25:23.085 --> 00:25:27.885
So trust him. Let him handle it in his time and his way

457
00:25:28.105 --> 00:25:30.165
and release the bitterness of it so

458
00:25:30.165 --> 00:25:32.205
that you can walk in freedom.

459
00:25:37.045 --> 00:25:38.855
Well, you might be asking the question, well, okay,

460
00:25:38.855 --> 00:25:43.495
what do I do then if I'm not supposed to fight back,

461
00:25:43.495 --> 00:25:45.975
if I'm not supposed to, to revile and return?

462
00:25:45.975 --> 00:25:49.315
What do I do if I don't take matters into my own hands?

463
00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:50.715
What do I do then in response?

464
00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:53.595
Because hear me, we're not supposed to be passive.

465
00:25:55.165 --> 00:25:57.545
So Romans 12 will continue to show us we're not supposed

466
00:25:57.545 --> 00:25:58.585
to be passive in this.

467
00:25:58.655 --> 00:26:00.745
Just taking hits, doing nothing about it.

468
00:26:01.205 --> 00:26:03.865
Listen to Romans 12 verses 19 through 21.

469
00:26:04.775 --> 00:26:05.985
This is finishing the chapter.

470
00:26:06.015 --> 00:26:08.545
This is a contrast between what we should do

471
00:26:08.685 --> 00:26:09.705
and what we often do.

472
00:26:12.405 --> 00:26:15.465
Romans 1219 through 21, beloved never avenge yourselves,

473
00:26:15.645 --> 00:26:17.985
but leave it to the wrath of God for it is written,

474
00:26:17.985 --> 00:26:20.865
vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.

475
00:26:22.005 --> 00:26:23.705
Here's what we do to the contrary.

476
00:26:23.885 --> 00:26:25.665
If your enemy is hungry, feed him.

477
00:26:26.325 --> 00:26:29.065
If he's thirsty, give him something to drink for.

478
00:26:29.125 --> 00:26:31.905
By so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head.

479
00:26:33.115 --> 00:26:36.415
Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good.

480
00:26:39.385 --> 00:26:43.405
This is the Christian's secret weapon against evil,

481
00:26:45.615 --> 00:26:48.315
not retreat, not retaliation.

482
00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:54.615
Radical love like this is

483
00:26:54.615 --> 00:26:57.655
saying you could try to gain power through revenge,

484
00:26:58.275 --> 00:27:00.135
but this is saying the power

485
00:27:00.195 --> 00:27:03.335
of transforming love is far greater than anything you can

486
00:27:03.335 --> 00:27:05.095
manipulate and work out yourself.

487
00:27:06.495 --> 00:27:10.785
Love actually is greater again, not passive non-resistance,

488
00:27:10.815 --> 00:27:13.585
just kind of waiting it out, getting shot at all the time.

489
00:27:13.645 --> 00:27:16.105
No, this is aggressive love toward them.

490
00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:19.105
This is saying that we don't just

491
00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:20.545
refuse to harm our enemies.

492
00:27:20.685 --> 00:27:23.105
We actually actively seek their welfare.

493
00:27:23.765 --> 00:27:25.745
We actually meet their physical needs.

494
00:27:25.885 --> 00:27:28.745
We show them practical kindness. That's what this is saying.

495
00:27:28.965 --> 00:27:31.545
Our goal is to love them into God's kingdom,

496
00:27:31.965 --> 00:27:34.545
to reveal something different that we have

497
00:27:34.735 --> 00:27:36.065
that others don't have.

498
00:27:40.185 --> 00:27:43.165
And what did God's word say that all that would do

499
00:27:43.185 --> 00:27:45.645
to the person who is persecuting you.

500
00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:49.325
It says, as you tangibly love them,

501
00:27:49.585 --> 00:27:51.965
you'll heap burning coals on their head.

502
00:27:53.595 --> 00:27:56.655
Now obviously that's not to be taken literally like this

503
00:27:56.855 --> 00:27:58.695
December, you invite them over for a game of Uno

504
00:27:58.695 --> 00:28:00.375
and you put 'em right next in front of the fireplace

505
00:28:00.395 --> 00:28:02.575
and you heap the coals on their head as they're sitting.

506
00:28:02.595 --> 00:28:04.455
That's not what this is saying to do.

507
00:28:07.335 --> 00:28:11.215
These coals are shame

508
00:28:12.275 --> 00:28:15.775
and conviction that burn in the conscience

509
00:28:17.695 --> 00:28:22.135
whenever say for example, someone has tried to hurt you,

510
00:28:22.975 --> 00:28:25.855
persecute you, and all you get back in response,

511
00:28:26.515 --> 00:28:30.995
all they get back in response is love it.

512
00:28:31.305 --> 00:28:32.715
It's so confusing

513
00:28:34.645 --> 00:28:38.895
because what it does is it's,

514
00:28:39.675 --> 00:28:44.465
it's saying like That person wants to hurt you,

515
00:28:44.845 --> 00:28:47.825
and all they get is, is love back.

516
00:28:47.825 --> 00:28:50.105
Their hatred is reversed into love

517
00:28:50.125 --> 00:28:52.345
and it creates a moral crisis in their heart

518
00:28:52.345 --> 00:28:55.705
because they realize in that moment how much they are doing

519
00:28:55.855 --> 00:28:57.345
that is so different than you are.

520
00:28:57.435 --> 00:29:00.145
Their hatred is exposed by your love

521
00:29:00.285 --> 00:29:02.705
and that only does a work in their heart.

522
00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:04.905
You are not supposed to take revenge.

523
00:29:05.045 --> 00:29:08.105
You're allowing God to work in their heart as you love them,

524
00:29:09.075 --> 00:29:10.215
as you bless them back.

525
00:29:10.405 --> 00:29:13.895
That creates something in themselves that is this idea

526
00:29:14.035 --> 00:29:17.135
of coals of shame and conviction in their heart.

527
00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:23.485
And so we, we get that.

528
00:29:23.645 --> 00:29:25.725
I think we can understand and probably have seen that happen

529
00:29:25.725 --> 00:29:26.885
before in this world,

530
00:29:27.945 --> 00:29:31.435
but when we think about doing this man

531
00:29:31.435 --> 00:29:32.955
that seems impossible, doesn't it?

532
00:29:34.705 --> 00:29:36.405
To really love someone who's hurting me

533
00:29:36.425 --> 00:29:38.565
to really love someone who's persecuting me,

534
00:29:38.565 --> 00:29:40.045
that sounds so impossible.

535
00:29:42.755 --> 00:29:45.935
Or when you think about the scale of evil in our world,

536
00:29:47.415 --> 00:29:50.595
how pervasive it is, like

537
00:29:50.695 --> 00:29:52.475
how could good ever win?

538
00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:56.435
Look, look at this. Look at the world like how could good

539
00:29:57.145 --> 00:30:00.155
ever win out over all of this around us?

540
00:30:01.095 --> 00:30:03.155
But Man,

541
00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:04.955
this is the great reversal of the kingdom of God.

542
00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:08.835
Many of Jesus' parables talk about the kingdom

543
00:30:08.855 --> 00:30:11.435
of God being something that seems so small, seems

544
00:30:11.435 --> 00:30:13.955
so insignificant and it just begins to grow slowly

545
00:30:14.015 --> 00:30:15.635
and all of a sudden it takes over everything.

546
00:30:17.535 --> 00:30:20.555
That's the idea here is that yeah, evil is pervasive,

547
00:30:20.555 --> 00:30:22.355
evil is all around us,

548
00:30:22.735 --> 00:30:25.835
but the great reversal in the kingdom of God is

549
00:30:25.835 --> 00:30:28.955
that evil seems strong, but good is stronger.

550
00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:32.515
Love is mightier than hate. Light conquers darkness.

551
00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:34.435
That is the kingdom of God.

552
00:30:34.565 --> 00:30:35.875
We're not just resisting evil,

553
00:30:36.015 --> 00:30:38.835
we are actually overcoming evil with good.

554
00:30:40.865 --> 00:30:43.525
That's the point when overcoming evil with good,

555
00:30:43.755 --> 00:30:48.315
that conquers the darkness like we have darkness all

556
00:30:48.315 --> 00:30:49.955
around us, it conquers it.

557
00:30:49.955 --> 00:30:52.515
When we overcome evil with good,

558
00:30:57.155 --> 00:30:59.255
we should never deny that our world is pretty dark.

559
00:31:01.165 --> 00:31:03.025
We got a lot of darkness all around us,

560
00:31:04.085 --> 00:31:07.665
but we have a couple options in how we can respond to that

561
00:31:07.985 --> 00:31:08.985
Darkness.

562
00:31:11.145 --> 00:31:13.125
We could sit back and just complain about it.

563
00:31:14.785 --> 00:31:16.125
We could throw stones at it.

564
00:31:16.985 --> 00:31:18.315
Look at how evil these people are.

565
00:31:18.315 --> 00:31:20.675
Look at how dark this world is and we could just sit back

566
00:31:20.695 --> 00:31:24.555
and lob grenades at it

567
00:31:26.635 --> 00:31:31.165
or, Or we could start shining some

568
00:31:31.165 --> 00:31:32.685
light into the dark world.

569
00:31:34.675 --> 00:31:36.305
Those are options that we have.

570
00:31:37.245 --> 00:31:39.545
We could try bringing in some good

571
00:31:39.845 --> 00:31:41.665
to overcome the evil that's all around us.

572
00:31:42.765 --> 00:31:45.145
We could look at it and try to avoid it

573
00:31:45.145 --> 00:31:46.625
and stay away from it and complain about it.

574
00:31:46.645 --> 00:31:49.025
Or we could start bringing good into the evil.

575
00:31:49.405 --> 00:31:53.835
We could remember that we're not victims here, man.

576
00:31:53.835 --> 00:31:55.595
Look at how dark the world is. Well, we're so sorry.

577
00:31:55.605 --> 00:31:57.795
We're so sad we live here. No, we're not victims.

578
00:31:58.215 --> 00:32:01.795
We are actually by the overcoming love and power of God.

579
00:32:01.935 --> 00:32:04.355
We are victors in this world.

580
00:32:05.945 --> 00:32:08.495
Jesus talks about, yes, in this world you'll have trouble,

581
00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:11.495
but take heart because I have overcome the world.

582
00:32:11.795 --> 00:32:13.215
That's hope. We have.

583
00:32:15.025 --> 00:32:17.895
We're in Christ, which means we are victors over the

584
00:32:18.135 --> 00:32:20.215
darkness and over the evil already.

585
00:32:22.275 --> 00:32:23.415
So why are we overwhelmed

586
00:32:24.205 --> 00:32:27.495
that we can't see good overcome evil?

587
00:32:29.925 --> 00:32:33.065
In fact, that's what you were designed for Christian

588
00:32:34.805 --> 00:32:36.585
to bring good into the world.

589
00:32:37.095 --> 00:32:40.595
That was, That was one of the major themes.

590
00:32:40.715 --> 00:32:42.595
I preached all week about this at kids camp

591
00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:47.075
and we looked at Ephesians two, the transformation

592
00:32:47.075 --> 00:32:50.235
that comes whenever you are dead in your sin, far from God,

593
00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:52.355
separated from him, hopeless in the world.

594
00:32:52.735 --> 00:32:56.155
But God rich in mercy brought about this transformation

595
00:32:56.155 --> 00:32:58.435
through the gospel to make you alive in

596
00:32:58.435 --> 00:32:59.875
him by grace, through faith.

597
00:33:00.095 --> 00:33:02.035
You did nothing. You can earn nothing.

598
00:33:02.335 --> 00:33:03.675
You should boast about nothing.

599
00:33:03.895 --> 00:33:06.275
But then listen to how Ephesians two ends,

600
00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:09.595
that section it says, for we are his workmanship,

601
00:33:09.945 --> 00:33:12.835
created in Christ Jesus for good works,

602
00:33:14.255 --> 00:33:18.005
which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.

603
00:33:21.595 --> 00:33:23.895
That's what God did when he saved you.

604
00:33:24.115 --> 00:33:28.455
He set it up uniquely that you can show him off

605
00:33:28.835 --> 00:33:32.655
to a world that is dark in ways that only you can,

606
00:33:32.805 --> 00:33:34.375
that he designed for you to do it.

607
00:33:34.475 --> 00:33:39.095
And that is through good works, overcoming evil with good.

608
00:33:45.065 --> 00:33:49.535
He wasn't a perfect man, but in the face of much evil

609
00:33:49.595 --> 00:33:52.505
and hatred, Martin Luther King Jr.

610
00:33:52.595 --> 00:33:55.505
Tried to exemplify this concept as best he could.

611
00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:59.735
I know he had moral faults, he had theological faults.

612
00:33:59.755 --> 00:34:03.215
But in the midst of an intense battle in America

613
00:34:03.635 --> 00:34:05.615
for whether African Americans were gonna be treated

614
00:34:05.675 --> 00:34:09.025
as equals or not, He tried to love

615
00:34:11.705 --> 00:34:14.635
like he, he was faced with much

616
00:34:15.585 --> 00:34:18.035
intense threats to him and his family.

617
00:34:20.685 --> 00:34:22.465
He took heat from all sides.

618
00:34:24.405 --> 00:34:25.545
He paid a high price,

619
00:34:27.405 --> 00:34:30.465
but his focus was on loving people who hated him.

620
00:34:33.145 --> 00:34:36.835
There's a quote that he wrote, said, talked a lot about,

621
00:34:37.005 --> 00:34:38.915
we'll put it on the screen as well so you can see this, but,

622
00:34:38.915 --> 00:34:40.275
but listen to what he said.

623
00:34:42.605 --> 00:34:44.255
Returning hate for hate.

624
00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:49.725
Multiplies hate adding deeper darkness

625
00:34:49.945 --> 00:34:52.365
to a night already devoid of stars.

626
00:34:55.045 --> 00:34:57.245
Darkness cannot drive out darkness.

627
00:34:58.945 --> 00:35:03.275
Only light can do that Hate cannot

628
00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:04.635
drive out hate.

629
00:35:05.825 --> 00:35:06.995
Only love can do

630
00:35:06.995 --> 00:35:10.955
that church.

631
00:35:10.955 --> 00:35:13.795
This is what it looks like to live as a citizen of heaven

632
00:35:15.175 --> 00:35:16.805
while still here on earth.

633
00:35:21.005 --> 00:35:22.775
This is how we show a watching world,

634
00:35:23.085 --> 00:35:25.535
that our God reigns over all things.

635
00:35:25.565 --> 00:35:28.095
That we can trust him with the future.

636
00:35:28.325 --> 00:35:30.855
That we don't have to take anything into our own hands.

637
00:35:30.915 --> 00:35:34.335
We can trust that he's gonna do it and he reigns over all.

638
00:35:34.615 --> 00:35:37.095
'cause when they see us, bless instead of curse,

639
00:35:37.475 --> 00:35:39.725
when they see us trust God's justice

640
00:35:39.755 --> 00:35:41.125
instead of seeking revenge.

641
00:35:41.835 --> 00:35:44.725
When they see us overcoming hatred with love,

642
00:35:44.995 --> 00:35:47.565
when they see all of that, they see something

643
00:35:47.635 --> 00:35:50.925
that can only be explained by the gospel of Jesus Christ.

644
00:35:51.835 --> 00:35:54.285
They see something that can only be produced

645
00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:58.965
as we reflect on the great love of God for enemies like us,

646
00:36:00.235 --> 00:36:02.125
that we can love our enemies just like that.

647
00:36:05.145 --> 00:36:07.205
So let's pray towards that end together.

648
00:36:10.065 --> 00:36:12.285
And I just want us to take some time to reflect on this

649
00:36:16.825 --> 00:36:21.165
in light of his word, as we seek

650
00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:24.645
to realign our lives back to the standard of Christ,

651
00:36:25.235 --> 00:36:28.445
just reflect for a moment, first on the gospel of Jesus,

652
00:36:32.395 --> 00:36:36.525
that he would love an enemy like you,

653
00:36:39.065 --> 00:36:41.325
to make you his child,

654
00:36:43.625 --> 00:36:45.205
to adopt you into his family.

655
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:51.165
That is stunning

656
00:36:54.665 --> 00:36:59.165
to pay for your life, your redemption with his son's life.

657
00:37:03.075 --> 00:37:03.765
It's overwhelming.

658
00:37:08.065 --> 00:37:12.605
And so maybe you are a believer here today,

659
00:37:13.065 --> 00:37:15.245
and this, this I pray, is reawakening

660
00:37:15.995 --> 00:37:19.885
something in your heart for his great love for you,

661
00:37:20.465 --> 00:37:21.765
his personal love for you.

662
00:37:23.515 --> 00:37:24.565
Just rejoice in that.

663
00:37:25.345 --> 00:37:26.685
Let that fill you so much

664
00:37:26.685 --> 00:37:28.445
that you overflow with love for others.

665
00:37:32.785 --> 00:37:34.565
Or maybe you don't know that love

666
00:37:34.745 --> 00:37:37.685
and you've, you've just seen today that he's,

667
00:37:37.685 --> 00:37:38.885
or maybe over the last few weeks

668
00:37:38.905 --> 00:37:41.005
or once he's, he's been stirring your heart

669
00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:42.405
to say that, man, you're not a believer.

670
00:37:42.425 --> 00:37:43.725
You don't know me. I don't know you.

671
00:37:43.735 --> 00:37:47.565
Let's, let's, let's take that reality today.

672
00:37:47.905 --> 00:37:49.645
And if that's you and just run

673
00:37:49.705 --> 00:37:52.965
to him, you feel unworthy.

674
00:37:53.025 --> 00:37:54.525
You don't feel like you can measure up.

675
00:37:54.825 --> 00:37:57.685
He doesn't ask you to do that before you come to him.

676
00:37:59.865 --> 00:38:03.845
He did it for you. So run freely to him

677
00:38:05.185 --> 00:38:08.605
in faith, in his life, death and resurrection for you.

678
00:38:10.465 --> 00:38:12.365
He saves those who come to him by faith.

679
00:38:18.785 --> 00:38:21.805
All of us though, need to reflect on this

680
00:38:24.275 --> 00:38:26.845
application of what we've seen in God's word.

681
00:38:28.795 --> 00:38:30.165
Just a couple questions.

682
00:38:33.505 --> 00:38:36.285
The question is not whether someone has wronged

683
00:38:36.285 --> 00:38:39.165
you, every one of us.

684
00:38:43.345 --> 00:38:45.725
The question is, will you trust God enough

685
00:38:45.905 --> 00:38:47.085
to love your enemies?

686
00:38:49.945 --> 00:38:54.925
Do you trust him to release it

687
00:38:55.745 --> 00:38:56.925
and love them instead?

688
00:38:58.975 --> 00:39:02.525
Maybe not trust them but to love them?

689
00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:15.005
Will you believe that his way

690
00:39:15.005 --> 00:39:18.325
of overcoming evil is better than the world's way?

691
00:39:21.465 --> 00:39:22.605
You don't have to take revenge.

692
00:39:22.625 --> 00:39:24.805
You don't have to take matters into your own hands.

693
00:39:24.905 --> 00:39:28.045
You can trust God. Do you trust God's way?

694
00:39:32.275 --> 00:39:37.165
That good, that love will overcome darkness

695
00:39:37.385 --> 00:39:37.965
and hate

696
00:39:48.805 --> 00:39:50.485
tying it with the gospel again?

697
00:39:50.485 --> 00:39:54.165
Then will you let the love of Christ

698
00:39:54.785 --> 00:39:56.165
so fill your heart?

699
00:39:57.715 --> 00:40:01.725
That blessing flows out to everyone around you, even those

700
00:40:01.725 --> 00:40:02.605
who persecute you

701
00:40:07.025 --> 00:40:08.525
to be filled with the love

702
00:40:09.265 --> 00:40:10.805
and the spirit of God

703
00:40:12.715 --> 00:40:14.525
that it overflows in blessing.

704
00:40:19.155 --> 00:40:22.165
Lord, this is hard. This is so hard.

705
00:40:25.395 --> 00:40:26.285
Help us, God.

706
00:40:33.785 --> 00:40:35.285
Church is in a moment

707
00:40:37.305 --> 00:40:39.885
as we sing the rest of the time together.

708
00:40:40.025 --> 00:40:44.845
If you maybe are wrestling with maybe some unforgiveness

709
00:40:44.945 --> 00:40:46.165
or bitterness in your heart

710
00:40:47.025 --> 00:40:49.005
and you just want someone to pray for you

711
00:40:50.795 --> 00:40:52.455
or talk with someone briefly about that,

712
00:40:52.455 --> 00:40:54.335
or maybe talk about what it means to be a believer,

713
00:40:54.565 --> 00:40:59.015
Christian, we have a prayer team just set up against the

714
00:40:59.015 --> 00:41:03.535
walls here, inside this room on the sides during the songs.

715
00:41:05.075 --> 00:41:07.255
So at any point, just slip outta your seat, go talk

716
00:41:07.255 --> 00:41:09.935
to somebody if you need to or after.

717
00:41:13.275 --> 00:41:14.455
But let's just rejoice

718
00:41:14.455 --> 00:41:18.735
and respond first to his great love for enemies like us.

719
00:41:21.355 --> 00:41:24.655
So if you're able to stand together, sing with faith.
