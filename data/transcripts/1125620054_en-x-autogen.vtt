WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.295 --> 00:00:02.205
There will be people from every tribe,

2
00:00:02.255 --> 00:00:03.605
every tongue, every nation.

3
00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:06.725
There will be people from penile singing the praises

4
00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:08.795
of lamb in their language.

5
00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.875
Um, and we, we look forward to that day,

6
00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:23.415
shall I, Alan, uh, and planning Aglo.

7
00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:27.335
And, Hi, I'm Alan, and me

8
00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:29.535
and my wife are planting a church in North Wales.

9
00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.775
So my, uh, my first contact with

10
00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:34.975
what I would say true Christianity was, um, was

11
00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:37.095
through an American missionary, um, over in Wales

12
00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.575
back in 2012.

13
00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:43.215
Um, so Will Bowden was over from the States.

14
00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:45.295
He was living in Wales as a missionary.

15
00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:48.175
He was the first guy to put a Bible in my hand, um,

16
00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:50.095
and the first person to speak about Jesus

17
00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:51.495
as somebody he knew.

18
00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:52.975
And I didn't have a category for that,

19
00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:54.735
and that was mind blowing.

20
00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.015
So that's where my journey began.

21
00:00:56.275 --> 00:00:59.615
So the, um, the first, uh, person from Henderson that I, uh,

22
00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:00.895
that I met was, was Chris Jones.

23
00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:03.415
Um, I met Chris

24
00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:07.055
before I was saved, which was, um, which was great for me.

25
00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:12.055
Um, in that, In our church in Swansea, we didn't have many,

26
00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:14.255
I don't wanna say older Christians, um,

27
00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:16.495
but we'll say more mature Christians.

28
00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:19.615
Um, and so having, uh, mission teams over from Oklahoma,

29
00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:21.095
it wasn't just about evangelism,

30
00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:22.575
but also about showing what mature

31
00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:23.655
Christian life looked like.

32
00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:26.695
And so, um, Chris was kind of Uncle Chris

33
00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:28.215
for a lot of us in that church.

34
00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:31.095
Um, him and his team showing us what it meant to be a,

35
00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:32.495
a mature follower of Christ.

36
00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:35.575
So my wife and I were in a conference down in South Wales

37
00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:36.815
about two and a half years ago.

38
00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:40.055
Um, and although we were seated at different places in,

39
00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.095
in the hall, um, during the sermon, uh,

40
00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:44.375
we both felt the Lord speak to us in the same three ways.

41
00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:48.335
Um, the, this quiet voice saying, clean, clean, clean,

42
00:01:48.335 --> 00:01:50.855
which is the area, um, that we're, we're going to move to,

43
00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:53.215
um, it's a peninsula up in North Wales.

44
00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:58.055
Um, we both saw in our, in our mind, a a vision of the,

45
00:01:58.155 --> 00:01:59.735
the mountains of Penea.

46
00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:02.415
And then, um, the Lord spoke to us through,

47
00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:04.615
through the woods of Psalm 121, um,

48
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.895
called Come After Me.

49
00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.135
Um, I lift my eyes to the hills from

50
00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:11.215
where does my help come?

51
00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.855
And we spent time seeking the Lord in prayer, um,

52
00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:16.775
coming alongside our, our church in Kamar as well, uh,

53
00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:19.375
discerning what the Lord's will was for us.

54
00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:21.775
And, um, became clear that going north

55
00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:23.255
and starting a new work was

56
00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:24.735
what he had in my, uh, in, in store for us.

57
00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:27.975
So the area that we are moving to, um, pen theme

58
00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:30.535
that peninsula up in North Wales, um,

59
00:02:30.555 --> 00:02:33.015
around 10,000 people live in the rural area,

60
00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:35.295
which is the area that we in particular feel called to.

61
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.895
Of those 10,000 people, um,

62
00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:40.535
56% would say that they're Christian.

63
00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:43.255
Um, but realistically, maybe 2%

64
00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:45.015
of them actually attend a place of worship.

65
00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:48.015
And even those places of worship are not ones

66
00:02:48.175 --> 00:02:49.495
where the gospel is being preached.

67
00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:53.735
Um, we would say that there is no healthy church in

68
00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:55.375
that area through the medium of Welsh.

69
00:02:55.715 --> 00:02:58.655
And it is an area where 70% of people speak Welsh

70
00:02:58.655 --> 00:02:59.765
as their first language,

71
00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:03.485
and 77% have some proficiency with the language.

72
00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:07.365
Um, and so the Lord's put it on our heart,

73
00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:10.925
and we think it's, um, a biblical calling to, to make sure

74
00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:12.725
that people hear the gospel in their tongue

75
00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:16.685
and build a relationship with God in their language

76
00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:18.965
and worship him in their language.

77
00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:21.685
We trust that on the last day there will be people from

78
00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:23.885
every tribe, every tongue, every nation.

79
00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:26.965
There will be people from penile singing the praises

80
00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:29.045
of the land in their language.

81
00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:31.085
Um, and we, we look forward to that day.

82
00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:34.565
So the ways that you can be praying for us, um, firstly,

83
00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:35.645
please, please thank the Lord

84
00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.645
for he's done in our lives over the last two

85
00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:39.605
and a half years as he's prepared us for this work.

86
00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:44.325
Um, he's been so gracious in bringing a team around us of,

87
00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:46.445
uh, you know, for you guys, it is a small team.

88
00:03:46.675 --> 00:03:48.165
It's six people. Um,

89
00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:50.645
but we're really blessed to have already a, a, a team of,

90
00:03:51.985 --> 00:03:54.605
of people full of zeal for the Lord and his work.

91
00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:56.525
Um, thank the Lord that already

92
00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:59.045
before we're even going, um, in the visits that we've had,

93
00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:01.485
um, some people have given their lives to Christ already,

94
00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:05.125
um, and pray more than anything that we would be faithful to

95
00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:09.805
what he's calling us to do, um,

96
00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:14.125
adding Vete and ene.

97
00:04:15.295 --> 00:04:16.765

Um, we are so looking forward to see
