WEBVTT

1
00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:21.015
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:22.175
It's great to see you.

3
00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:24.295
Uh, if you're new to our church, we're thankful

4
00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:25.815
that you would choose to be with us.

5
00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:28.255
Uh, we'd love to get to know you, help you connect

6
00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:31.295
with the Lord, and connect with our church if possible.

7
00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:34.015
And so you just head out to the new here area in the lobby.

8
00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:35.855
Uh, there's someone out there to greet you and,

9
00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:38.295
and to get to know you as best we can.

10
00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:40.575
Uh, but you're here on a great Sunday

11
00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.615
because we are nearing the end of this series

12
00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:46.135
through the book of First Samuel.

13
00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:50.295
In fact, next Sunday will be the last sermon

14
00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:51.615
in this series.

15
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:55.055
Hint, hint, for those of you who join me in dressing up

16
00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:57.775
to honor that, uh, that's what's coming next week.

17
00:00:57.875 --> 00:00:59.895
But it's been powerful to see

18
00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:01.735
as we've journeyed this whole book,

19
00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:05.255
the the Israel Struggle for a King.

20
00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:08.495
And, and they had to decide whether they were going

21
00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.255
to allow, just simply let God be their king,

22
00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:13.495
or if they were gonna ask for a king

23
00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:14.935
like everyone else around them.

24
00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:16.615
And we've seen where they've gone with that,

25
00:01:16.615 --> 00:01:21.575
that they did ask for a king, yet God still worked in spite

26
00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:23.335
of their rebellion.

27
00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:26.535
And he was preparing the way for David

28
00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:29.655
to eventually become the greatest king that Israel ever had

29
00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:34.855
as a type of the Messiah that he was looking forward

30
00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:36.695
to the Messiah to come.

31
00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:39.415
David is a type of that.

32
00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:42.575
As we get into it today though, I want

33
00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:45.735
to tell you about my high school experience with an author,

34
00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:48.215
uh, that some of you might have heard of named, uh,

35
00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:49.335
Shakespeare, I think is his name.

36
00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:51.815
Right. Um, and listen,

37
00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:54.615
I don't remember a whole lot about what I would read.

38
00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:56.975
I, I do remember Cliff's Notes was a big help at the time,

39
00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:01.735
but, uh, I, I do remember something about what he, uh,

40
00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:04.415
when we were assigned to read this in English class, it was

41
00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:07.735
all his works we read were tragedies.

42
00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:12.175
Tragedies. And I give you a couple examples, Romeo

43
00:02:12.175 --> 00:02:15.295
and Juliet, that's a tragedy where these two young people

44
00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:18.295
who are supposedly in love actually end up dying for that.

45
00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:19.575
And it's tragic.

46
00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:21.975
And then you've got Macbeth, which is even more relevant

47
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.855
to this discussed ambition and tyranny

48
00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:29.135
and prideful vengeance ending tragically as well.

49
00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:35.845
Well, the narrative involving King Saul here in one Samuel

50
00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:38.605
is definitely a tragedy

51
00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:43.455
because it describes the terrible events

52
00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:46.575
that befall this main character named Saul.

53
00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:48.915
And it just think about Saul, right?

54
00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:53.235
Such high talent, such high expectations,

55
00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:59.245
yet such pride, such self-sufficiency,

56
00:03:01.675 --> 00:03:03.705
eventually leading to his demise.

57
00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:07.505
And we'll see here at the end of this book.

58
00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:11.345
See, in many ways, Saul was the anti-hero.

59
00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:14.525
David is often not perfectly,

60
00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:16.725
but often presented as this is what you should do.

61
00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:20.645
And Saul is the case of what you are not supposed to do

62
00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:23.605
nearly in its entire life.

63
00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:28.615
And we'll see that today in its full and final form,

64
00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.855
and it gets really dark.

65
00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:36.335
Yet in that darkness, my hope is that we today

66
00:03:37.355 --> 00:03:40.375
can see the light of the gospel through it

67
00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:43.975
and the hope we can have in the gospel as well.

68
00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:46.685
And so if you're not already there, turn with me

69
00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:48.325
to First Samuel chapter 28.

70
00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:52.845
First Samuel in the Old Testament, big number 28,

71
00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.125
and that's chapter 28.

72
00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:57.925
This is actually the section we skipped last week.

73
00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:01.685
If you were here, we tracked through David's story,

74
00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:05.565
the narrator inserted chapter 28 in the middle,

75
00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:09.845
as a way to contrast Saul with David,

76
00:04:10.755 --> 00:04:15.285
That While David was resetting his relationship

77
00:04:15.315 --> 00:04:19.445
with the Lord and actually ended up able to avoid the battle

78
00:04:19.715 --> 00:04:23.165
that was coming with the Philistines Saul,

79
00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:26.005
you'll see today what he was doing

80
00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:28.965
as he prepared for that same battle.

81
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.495
Look at it now with me. I'm gonna start in verse three.

82
00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:35.615
I'm gonna read the whole chapter,

83
00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:39.795
chapter 28, starting in verse three.

84
00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:45.995
Now, Samuel had died and all Israel had mourned for him

85
00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:47.995
and buried him in Rama his own city.

86
00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:50.395
And Saul had put the mediums

87
00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:52.555
and the necromancers out of the land.

88
00:04:54.135 --> 00:04:56.915
The Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Hunam,

89
00:04:56.915 --> 00:05:00.035
and Saul gathered all Israel and they encamped at Gilboa.

90
00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:04.395
When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid.

91
00:05:04.775 --> 00:05:05.995
His heart trembled greatly.

92
00:05:07.595 --> 00:05:09.335
And when Saul inquired of the Lord,

93
00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:11.615
the Lord did not answer him

94
00:05:12.765 --> 00:05:15.265
Either By dreams or by em or by prophets.

95
00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:19.665
Then Saul said to his servants, seek out for me a woman

96
00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:22.465
who is a medium that I may go to her and inquire of her.

97
00:05:24.255 --> 00:05:25.595
His servants said to him, behold,

98
00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:26.715
there's a medium at indoor.

99
00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:29.515
And so Saul disguised himself and put on other garments

100
00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:31.315
and went, he and two men with him.

101
00:05:31.575 --> 00:05:33.515
And they came to the woman by night

102
00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:36.995
and he said, divine for me by a spirit

103
00:05:37.055 --> 00:05:39.755
and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you.

104
00:05:40.815 --> 00:05:42.675
And the woman said to him, surely you know

105
00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:44.995
what Saul has done, how he's cut off the mediums

106
00:05:44.995 --> 00:05:46.195
and Necker answers from the land.

107
00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:48.035
Why then are you laying a trap for my life

108
00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:49.035
to bring about my death?

109
00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:55.135
But Saul swore to her by the Lord, As the Lord lives,

110
00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:57.190
no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.

111
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.205
And he said, then the woman said,

112
00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:00.325
whom shall I bring up for you?

113
00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:02.645
And he said, bring up Samuel for me.

114
00:06:03.835 --> 00:06:06.485
When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice.

115
00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:09.485
And the woman said to Saul, why have you deceived me?

116
00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:13.205
You are Saul. And the king said to her, do not be afraid.

117
00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:16.085
What do you see? The woman said to Saul,

118
00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:17.725
I see a God coming up out of the earth.

119
00:06:18.985 --> 00:06:20.485
He said to her, what's his appearance?

120
00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:22.205
And she said, an old man is coming up.

121
00:06:22.205 --> 00:06:23.285
He's wrapped in a robe.

122
00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:25.205
And Saul knew that it was Samuel,

123
00:06:25.265 --> 00:06:27.485
and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage.

124
00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:30.165
Then Samuel said to Saul,

125
00:06:30.225 --> 00:06:32.325
why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?

126
00:06:33.635 --> 00:06:35.325
Saul answered, I'm in great distress

127
00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:37.245
for the Philistines are warring against me,

128
00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:39.565
and God has turned away from me

129
00:06:39.905 --> 00:06:43.805
and answers me no more either by prophets or by dreams.

130
00:06:44.435 --> 00:06:46.725
Therefore, I've summoned you to tell me what I shall do.

131
00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:49.845
And Samuel said, why then do you ask me

132
00:06:50.575 --> 00:06:52.085
since the Lord has turned from you

133
00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:56.575
and become your enemy, the Lord has done to you as he spoke

134
00:06:56.595 --> 00:06:59.255
by me, for the Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand

135
00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:00.695
and given it to your neighbor, David,

136
00:07:01.445 --> 00:07:03.735
because you did not obey the voice of the Lord,

137
00:07:03.835 --> 00:07:06.815
did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek.

138
00:07:06.815 --> 00:07:09.535
Therefore, the Lord has done this thing to you this day.

139
00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.845
Moreover, the Lord will give Israel also

140
00:07:12.845 --> 00:07:16.285
with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you

141
00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:19.365
and your sons shall be with me, meaning die.

142
00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:22.665
The Lord will give the army Israel also

143
00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:23.865
into the hand of the Philistines.

144
00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:27.925
Then Saul fell at once, full length on the ground, filled

145
00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:30.085
with fear because of the words of Samuel.

146
00:07:30.535 --> 00:07:31.925
There was no strength in him.

147
00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:33.525
He'd eaten nothing all day, all night.

148
00:07:33.705 --> 00:07:36.485
And the woman came to Saul when she saw he was terrified,

149
00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:38.765
she said, behold, your servant has obeyed you.

150
00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.285
I've taken my life in my hand.

151
00:07:40.285 --> 00:07:42.085
Listen to what you said to me now,

152
00:07:42.085 --> 00:07:43.445
therefore, you obey your servant.

153
00:07:43.665 --> 00:07:45.725
Let me set a morsel of bread before you

154
00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:46.685
and eat that you should have

155
00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:47.845
strength when you go on your way.

156
00:07:48.785 --> 00:07:50.245
He refused. He said, I will not eat.

157
00:07:50.425 --> 00:07:52.205
But his servants together with a woman urged him.

158
00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:53.965
He listened to their words and he rose from the bed

159
00:07:53.965 --> 00:07:55.685
and sat on the bed and the woman

160
00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:56.845
had a fatten calf in the house.

161
00:07:56.865 --> 00:07:58.445
She killed it, took flour

162
00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:00.085
and needed it baked on lemon bread with it.

163
00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:03.365
She put it before Saul and his servants, and they ate,

164
00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:07.165
and then they rose and went away that night.

165
00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.955
So a lot to explain here.

166
00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:14.675
I know we'll get into it a little bit more,

167
00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:17.315
but let's just take first glance, just look at

168
00:08:17.315 --> 00:08:18.915
what we just saw.

169
00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:23.395
Is it not stunning how far

170
00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:28.815
Saul has fallen king, anointed all

171
00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:30.855
of this, and here on the night

172
00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:33.735
before, the most important battle of his life,

173
00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:35.175
this is what he's doing.

174
00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:40.905
That's why it's a tragedy. It's tragic.

175
00:08:43.365 --> 00:08:45.265
So here's what we're gonna do with this passage.

176
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.305
As we see the tragedy of Saul's life,

177
00:08:48.425 --> 00:08:51.345
I wanna use this passage to simply share three principles

178
00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:54.625
from Saul's life and really from the whole book,

179
00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:57.250
but then, then also three applications from his life

180
00:08:57.345 --> 00:08:58.685
and the book as well.

181
00:08:58.865 --> 00:09:02.325
So three principles, then three applications.

182
00:09:02.345 --> 00:09:03.645
And here's the first principle,

183
00:09:05.075 --> 00:09:06.295
really, again, the whole book.

184
00:09:07.525 --> 00:09:09.095
It's that Saul responded

185
00:09:09.095 --> 00:09:11.975
to crisis differently than David did.

186
00:09:14.765 --> 00:09:17.815
Saul responded to crisis differently than David.

187
00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:20.495
We've seen it over and over again, especially right here.

188
00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:23.825
You see it again. Here's the first crisis

189
00:09:23.895 --> 00:09:26.665
that Saul faced here in chapter 28, the first crisis,

190
00:09:27.035 --> 00:09:29.585
right off the bat, verse three, it's that Samuel had died.

191
00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:34.215
Now remember Samuel Heath's named the book, of course, but

192
00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:35.975
but the stabilizing force

193
00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:40.215
that helped transition Israel from the judges to the kings.

194
00:09:40.645 --> 00:09:44.335
This, this voice of God, the mouthpiece of God, the one

195
00:09:44.335 --> 00:09:46.855
who anointed both the kings of Saul

196
00:09:46.855 --> 00:09:51.215
and David, this amazing, powerful figure that was the vessel

197
00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:52.935
of God to the people.

198
00:09:53.325 --> 00:09:56.775
He's now gone. He's dead.

199
00:09:59.035 --> 00:10:02.055
So how would Saul respond to that crisis?

200
00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:06.585
Well, he derailed even further.

201
00:10:07.975 --> 00:10:10.225
He'd already been, now he's even further.

202
00:10:10.245 --> 00:10:12.225
And that's the main point of this passage.

203
00:10:14.215 --> 00:10:15.665
It's Saul's, the all

204
00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:19.145
of chapter 28 is Saul's response to verse six.

205
00:10:19.975 --> 00:10:21.225
Look at what verse six says.

206
00:10:24.085 --> 00:10:26.495
When Saul inquired of the Lord,

207
00:10:26.995 --> 00:10:29.415
the Lord did not answer him.

208
00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:32.565
Dreams are in Prophe.

209
00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:35.085
Those are the ways that God would speak at that time.

210
00:10:35.905 --> 00:10:40.765
But again, the point the Lord did not answer him

211
00:10:41.785 --> 00:10:45.005
all of chapter 28 is Saul's response to that.

212
00:10:48.155 --> 00:10:50.375
And, and really Samuel's death is kind

213
00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:54.535
of just a metaphor here for Saul's relationship with God.

214
00:10:56.315 --> 00:10:59.095
Samuel and Saul had not spoken for months,

215
00:10:59.155 --> 00:11:00.735
if not years at this point.

216
00:11:01.915 --> 00:11:06.215
And now Samuel's completely gone in a way, God

217
00:11:06.755 --> 00:11:09.335
and Saul had not spoken for years.

218
00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:13.075
And Now in a sense, God is

219
00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:14.345
Gone.

220
00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:19.705
He's abandoned Saul. Saul is in the dark.

221
00:11:21.645 --> 00:11:23.945
And so that's the first crisis. How would Saul respond?

222
00:11:24.165 --> 00:11:27.545
He freaks out. The other crisis only added a layer to this,

223
00:11:27.545 --> 00:11:29.385
that the Philistines were right on the border.

224
00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:32.145
They're coming, right? They've amassed for battle.

225
00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:33.465
This whole thing's about to come.

226
00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:35.105
And how would Saul respond to this one?

227
00:11:35.205 --> 00:11:37.625
We saw how he responded to Samuel's death.

228
00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:39.305
How would Saul respond to this?

229
00:11:39.305 --> 00:11:44.265
Verse five, when Saul saw the army of the Philistines,

230
00:11:44.325 --> 00:11:48.145
he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly.

231
00:11:51.225 --> 00:11:55.525
Zero, trust in the Lord, no remembrance

232
00:11:55.905 --> 00:11:59.165
of all that God had done for generation

233
00:11:59.165 --> 00:12:00.845
after generation for his people.

234
00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:03.845
He came through, he defended them, he defeated the enemy.

235
00:12:03.945 --> 00:12:06.405
He completely forgot all of that.

236
00:12:06.545 --> 00:12:10.005
He just looked at his circumstances with utter terror.

237
00:12:12.155 --> 00:12:14.855
The army. What's hopeless?

238
00:12:16.675 --> 00:12:20.725
He was afraid. You add to that

239
00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:24.325
verse 15, what Saul said there, he's like,

240
00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:25.445
I'm in great distress.

241
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.365
The Philistines are warring against me.

242
00:12:27.585 --> 00:12:30.525
God has turned away from me and answers me no more.

243
00:12:33.275 --> 00:12:36.265
Right? He, he understands. He is a desperate man, right?

244
00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:40.345
He is terrified of the army. He knows God's abandoned him.

245
00:12:40.605 --> 00:12:42.785
He, he, he's so afraid

246
00:12:44.725 --> 00:12:49.015
that here in chapter 28, he breaks God's explicit

247
00:12:49.955 --> 00:12:52.095
law against the spirit world.

248
00:12:54.595 --> 00:12:56.015
That's how desperate he is.

249
00:12:57.205 --> 00:12:59.515
God's not speaking the army's right here.

250
00:12:59.635 --> 00:13:00.955
I better go find a way.

251
00:13:03.445 --> 00:13:06.565
I guess I'll use this way, Samuel. I need you.

252
00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:08.805
I gotta find somehow, and he just tries

253
00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:10.085
to figure out an answer.

254
00:13:10.865 --> 00:13:13.405
And he breaks God's law in doing so,

255
00:13:13.815 --> 00:13:16.205
quite the comparison to David, right?

256
00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:19.955
Again, David's not perfect.

257
00:13:20.045 --> 00:13:23.875
We'll see that again in the second Samuel passages in the

258
00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:26.435
fall when we get to that, like, that's, that's clear.

259
00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:30.715
David's not perfect, but David consistently came back

260
00:13:30.895 --> 00:13:32.995
to God when he was confronted over sin.

261
00:13:34.935 --> 00:13:36.035
He, he kept coming back.

262
00:13:36.055 --> 00:13:39.035
He kept returning to his trust in Yahweh.

263
00:13:39.035 --> 00:13:40.595
He said, God, I know you're gonna work this out.

264
00:13:40.775 --> 00:13:42.235
God, I know I strayed from you.

265
00:13:42.595 --> 00:13:43.915
I I need to come back to you.

266
00:13:44.235 --> 00:13:47.155
I know you're gonna work it out. I'm gonna trust you, Saul,

267
00:13:47.415 --> 00:13:49.435
at the complete opposite end of that spectrum.

268
00:13:52.015 --> 00:13:54.295
I don't trust you. I'm gonna do everything against you.

269
00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:57.695
That's what Saul gets to at this point.

270
00:14:03.935 --> 00:14:05.595
He responded to crisis very differently

271
00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.355
because something in his heart was very different than

272
00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:12.065
David's second

273
00:14:12.065 --> 00:14:13.585
principle is very similar to that actually.

274
00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:17.365
It's that Saul loved himself

275
00:14:17.385 --> 00:14:19.365
and this world more than he loved God.

276
00:14:21.785 --> 00:14:23.315
Seen it here, right? Chapter 28.

277
00:14:23.315 --> 00:14:26.475
But it's also throughout the whole book, Saul loved himself

278
00:14:26.935 --> 00:14:29.555
and this world more than God.

279
00:14:33.095 --> 00:14:35.095
I mean, Saul was trying to kill David

280
00:14:35.095 --> 00:14:36.295
because he felt threatened.

281
00:14:36.475 --> 00:14:38.575
He thought David's gonna steal my throne.

282
00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:41.655
In fact, God had already said David was gonna be the king,

283
00:14:41.655 --> 00:14:42.775
but Saul was like, no, no, no.

284
00:14:42.775 --> 00:14:44.535
I gotta clinging to this. I gotta hold on

285
00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:45.935
to everything like it's mine.

286
00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:48.175
I, I cherish this so much

287
00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:52.325
because Saul thought he had a better plan

288
00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:53.725
for his life than what God had.

289
00:14:53.825 --> 00:14:55.525
He thought, I have a better plan for Israel.

290
00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:57.765
I have a better plan for the world than

291
00:14:57.765 --> 00:14:59.325
what God has in store.

292
00:14:59.545 --> 00:15:02.445
So I'm gonna take it into my hands instead of trusting God.

293
00:15:06.645 --> 00:15:08.345
See, Saul had forgotten

294
00:15:09.155 --> 00:15:11.825
God's promise all the way back in Deuteronomy six,

295
00:15:12.015 --> 00:15:14.665
when God delivered his people out of slavery in Egypt.

296
00:15:14.805 --> 00:15:16.145
He brought them through the wilderness.

297
00:15:16.245 --> 00:15:19.385
He showed them miracle after miracle, all of these things.

298
00:15:19.725 --> 00:15:22.385
He says, then at the end, he says, I'm gonna bless you

299
00:15:22.925 --> 00:15:27.335
if you obey me, if you keep this covenant,

300
00:15:28.035 --> 00:15:29.815
all of this will be your, all

301
00:15:29.815 --> 00:15:34.295
of this will be a blessing if you, the covenant is, if you

302
00:15:35.245 --> 00:15:38.255
Deuteronomy six, five, love the Lord your God

303
00:15:38.445 --> 00:15:39.775
with all your heart and

304
00:15:39.775 --> 00:15:41.855
with all your soul and with all your might.

305
00:15:43.805 --> 00:15:48.615
That was it. Like if you guys want the blessing, love me

306
00:15:48.725 --> 00:15:51.175
with everything you are,

307
00:15:51.525 --> 00:15:54.135
that was Israel's primary responsibility.

308
00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:58.255
That was Saul's primary responsibility to love God first

309
00:15:58.355 --> 00:15:59.815
and foremost above all else.

310
00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:06.175
But instead, Saul put God to the test

311
00:16:07.575 --> 00:16:11.275
by chasing after all these other gods, including himself

312
00:16:11.535 --> 00:16:12.555
as his God.

313
00:16:13.535 --> 00:16:17.955
And what it did is it kindled God's anger against Saul.

314
00:16:22.105 --> 00:16:23.235
Saul loved himself

315
00:16:23.895 --> 00:16:27.115
and this world more than he loved God.

316
00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:33.915
It reminds me of in the New Testament, there's a story

317
00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:37.715
of Jesus talking to this man who was very rich,

318
00:16:39.335 --> 00:16:43.325
and this young man was moral, upright,

319
00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:47.665
did the right things, and Jesus pushed on the one thing

320
00:16:48.285 --> 00:16:50.225
in his heart that he was unwilling to give up.

321
00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:51.665
It was his wealth.

322
00:16:54.635 --> 00:16:56.815
And he said, you need to give that up to follow me.

323
00:16:56.835 --> 00:16:59.895
And the man walked away from Jesus.

324
00:17:03.685 --> 00:17:08.145
See, Saul loved his stuff, his power, his prestige,

325
00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:13.105
his position, all of that more than he loved Yahweh.

326
00:17:19.355 --> 00:17:22.535
And he lost the kingdom because of it,

327
00:17:22.805 --> 00:17:24.935
because of his rebellion against God.

328
00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:27.895
This is the third principle.

329
00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:32.335
He lost the kingdom because he said, God, I don't want you.

330
00:17:32.615 --> 00:17:36.055
I want to be in control. I think I have a better plan.

331
00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:41.055
My plan is better than yours. That's rebellion against God.

332
00:17:42.735 --> 00:17:43.915
And he lost the kingdom.

333
00:17:47.035 --> 00:17:50.365
You might recall back in earlier chapters in first Samuel,

334
00:17:54.705 --> 00:17:58.655
Samuel confronted Saul when Saul failed

335
00:17:58.655 --> 00:18:02.135
to obey God's command fully remember,

336
00:18:02.555 --> 00:18:06.055
God had commanded Saul to, to go to the Amalekites

337
00:18:06.055 --> 00:18:07.535
and to wipe everything out

338
00:18:07.535 --> 00:18:10.415
because they were opposing God in everything, in every way.

339
00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:15.895
And Saul kept some of 'em like the, the good animals

340
00:18:16.035 --> 00:18:17.815
for sacrifices is what he said, right?

341
00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:18.935
I'm gonna keep this stuff and,

342
00:18:18.955 --> 00:18:20.855
and God, I'm using this for you, right?

343
00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:22.415
I'm supposed to do this this way,

344
00:18:22.415 --> 00:18:23.575
but no, I'm gonna do it my way.

345
00:18:25.715 --> 00:18:30.515
This is what Samuel said to Saul back at

346
00:18:30.515 --> 00:18:32.795
that time, back in chapter 15, if you remember

347
00:18:32.795 --> 00:18:36.395
that chapter 15, this is what Samuel said to Saul.

348
00:18:36.735 --> 00:18:40.675
He said, has the Lord as great delight and burnt offerings

349
00:18:40.675 --> 00:18:43.315
and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord.

350
00:18:46.365 --> 00:18:49.545
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice.

351
00:18:51.325 --> 00:18:55.625
To listen to God is better than the fat

352
00:18:55.625 --> 00:18:56.945
of rams, right?

353
00:18:57.145 --> 00:18:59.305
'cause, 'cause Saul said, no, no, I'm gonna keep the good

354
00:18:59.855 --> 00:19:01.265
animals for the sacrifice.

355
00:19:01.805 --> 00:19:05.385
And Samuel's like God doesn't want that.

356
00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:08.425
God wants you. God wants your heart.

357
00:19:08.485 --> 00:19:10.905
God wants you to obey, to listen. That's what he wants.

358
00:19:11.245 --> 00:19:13.985
Now, watch what else he says, Samuel says to Saul,

359
00:19:14.325 --> 00:19:18.465
for rebellion is as the sin of divination

360
00:19:20.085 --> 00:19:24.105
And presumption is as iniquity and idolatry,

361
00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:28.415
because you have rejected the word of the Lord.

362
00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:32.055
He has also rejected you from being king.

363
00:19:34.185 --> 00:19:35.685
And you add verse 28 down there,

364
00:19:35.745 --> 00:19:39.605
the Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day,

365
00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:42.165
has given it to a neighbor of yours who's better than you.

366
00:19:44.355 --> 00:19:45.845
That is what Samuel said

367
00:19:45.845 --> 00:19:48.565
to Saul all the way back in chapter 15,

368
00:19:49.235 --> 00:19:50.965
when Saul rebelled.

369
00:19:52.345 --> 00:19:53.885
And here in chapter 28,

370
00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:58.165
that message just gets repeated from Samuel to Saul, right?

371
00:19:59.195 --> 00:20:00.685
Saul hears the exact same thing

372
00:20:00.795 --> 00:20:03.285
that God has become your enemy, Saul.

373
00:20:03.905 --> 00:20:07.885
God tore the kingdom away from you in favor of David Saul.

374
00:20:07.885 --> 00:20:12.665
You're in trouble. Which leads us

375
00:20:12.665 --> 00:20:14.905
to finally what we'll see next week.

376
00:20:16.295 --> 00:20:18.115
As spoiler alert, Saul

377
00:20:18.115 --> 00:20:20.075
and his sons die in the battle,

378
00:20:21.285 --> 00:20:22.815
just like God said would

379
00:20:22.815 --> 00:20:27.045
happen again.

380
00:20:28.505 --> 00:20:30.245
Is the story of Saul not a tragedy?

381
00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:35.365
Is it not just so sad to watch as we've been walking

382
00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:39.285
through this for months, we see Saul who has such potential,

383
00:20:39.285 --> 00:20:43.645
such a high stand, he just declines step by step by step

384
00:20:44.105 --> 00:20:46.765
to finally this point here.

385
00:20:48.365 --> 00:20:52.765
E even interestingly, back in chapter 15, Samuel equated

386
00:20:53.345 --> 00:20:56.565
the sin of rebellion with the sin of divination.

387
00:20:56.625 --> 00:21:01.485
Did you see that? To the point now in chapter 28,

388
00:21:02.865 --> 00:21:05.555
Saul actually does the sin of divination.

389
00:21:06.915 --> 00:21:11.095
It wasn't just like it. He actually dabbled in it.

390
00:21:15.725 --> 00:21:19.175
It's a tragedy. And

391
00:21:19.175 --> 00:21:20.535
so the question is, what do we do with it?

392
00:21:20.845 --> 00:21:21.855
What do we learn from this?

393
00:21:24.085 --> 00:21:26.015
Yeah, from this passage, chapter 28, of course.

394
00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:29.775
But really from the whole book, as we trace the narrative

395
00:21:29.775 --> 00:21:31.575
of Saul's life, what do we learn from this?

396
00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:33.015
And so we had the three principles.

397
00:21:33.015 --> 00:21:37.935
We see what God has done and how he's, how he's used this

398
00:21:37.955 --> 00:21:40.055
and how Saul has tracked and they signed.

399
00:21:40.275 --> 00:21:42.335
But but what are the three applications next?

400
00:21:42.475 --> 00:21:45.695
So we saw the principles. Now the three applications we can

401
00:21:45.905 --> 00:21:48.495
glean from this passage.

402
00:21:49.995 --> 00:21:51.415
So here, here's the first one today.

403
00:21:53.985 --> 00:21:56.885
Beware of searching for worldly answers

404
00:21:57.265 --> 00:21:58.845
to spiritual problems.

405
00:22:01.865 --> 00:22:06.205
Beware searching for worldly answers to

406
00:22:07.205 --> 00:22:08.485
spiritual problems.

407
00:22:12.675 --> 00:22:15.215
We need to read carefully when we read God's word,

408
00:22:16.195 --> 00:22:17.925
When we read chapter 28, carefully.

409
00:22:17.925 --> 00:22:22.125
It's interesting how many times this concept of hearing God

410
00:22:23.155 --> 00:22:26.005
listening to God, voice of God comes up in this passage.

411
00:22:26.325 --> 00:22:29.165
'cause think about this. Samuel was God's mouthpiece.

412
00:22:29.415 --> 00:22:30.525
Verse three, he died.

413
00:22:31.425 --> 00:22:34.365
So it's kinda like it stopped in some way.

414
00:22:34.455 --> 00:22:39.365
Verse six, God didn't answer Saul, he says that verse 15,

415
00:22:39.675 --> 00:22:41.125
Saul had seen that.

416
00:22:41.185 --> 00:22:42.845
God stopped answering him.

417
00:22:44.355 --> 00:22:47.585
Verse 16, Samuel said, why do you ask me? Right?

418
00:22:47.935 --> 00:22:50.425
There's all these things about hearing from God.

419
00:22:50.425 --> 00:22:52.145
Verse 17, God had spoken through Samuel

420
00:22:52.245 --> 00:22:53.745
before, but he's not anymore.

421
00:22:53.885 --> 00:22:56.785
In verse 18, Saul didn't obey God's voice.

422
00:22:56.815 --> 00:22:58.985
Like, so there's all this happening here.

423
00:22:59.095 --> 00:23:02.385
Hearing from God seems to be the core issue here.

424
00:23:04.955 --> 00:23:08.275
'cause the, the core issue was not something physical like,

425
00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:12.275
man, that the Philistine Army's coming, or Samuel has died.

426
00:23:12.575 --> 00:23:16.915
The core issue was that God had stopped speaking to Saul.

427
00:23:20.125 --> 00:23:24.895
He doesn't know what to do with that. It was

428
00:23:25.255 --> 00:23:27.855
a spiritual problem at its heart, right?

429
00:23:28.315 --> 00:23:31.215
It wasn't a physical problem of armies or deaths.

430
00:23:31.215 --> 00:23:34.575
It was a spiritual problem in his heart.

431
00:23:35.075 --> 00:23:39.305
Yet instead of getting to that root

432
00:23:39.685 --> 00:23:42.665
and running in repentance, back

433
00:23:42.665 --> 00:23:44.345
to God saying, here's where I am.

434
00:23:44.605 --> 00:23:46.005
I'm, I'm wrong here.

435
00:23:46.505 --> 00:23:49.805
He instead disobeyed further

436
00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:54.945
By heading to this necromancer, this medium, this

437
00:23:55.825 --> 00:23:57.465
spiritual woman.

438
00:23:59.045 --> 00:24:03.665
Now we could go really far down the rabbit hole of that, of

439
00:24:03.665 --> 00:24:06.225
what actually happened here in chapter 28.

440
00:24:07.245 --> 00:24:10.385
And if you go read about it later, you'll find all kinds

441
00:24:10.385 --> 00:24:13.345
of debate and opinions on what actually happened here

442
00:24:13.615 --> 00:24:15.905
with this woman and the spirit and Samuel.

443
00:24:16.045 --> 00:24:17.825
And was it just in Saul's mind?

444
00:24:17.885 --> 00:24:19.425
Was he thinking this way

445
00:24:19.445 --> 00:24:21.945
or was it actually happening that Samuel, we, we don't know.

446
00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:30.395
But what we know for sure is that this is evidence

447
00:24:30.495 --> 00:24:33.995
of how far Saul had fallen spiritually.

448
00:24:36.685 --> 00:24:40.335
Because God's law was abundantly clear that

449
00:24:40.335 --> 00:24:42.335
what he's doing here, what she's doing,

450
00:24:42.335 --> 00:24:45.175
what he's participating in, was forbidden.

451
00:24:45.795 --> 00:24:49.625
It was sinful. There's no question.

452
00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:51.225
It's not like some preference issue

453
00:24:51.225 --> 00:24:52.465
or it's a vague thing in the,

454
00:24:52.645 --> 00:24:55.665
it is absolutely clear in the Old Testament.

455
00:24:55.775 --> 00:24:57.345
It's what pagan nations did.

456
00:24:57.585 --> 00:24:58.945
'cause they didn't have a God who spoke to them.

457
00:24:58.945 --> 00:25:01.865
They're trying to find their way by finding spirits

458
00:25:01.865 --> 00:25:03.385
and spiritual world stuff.

459
00:25:03.385 --> 00:25:05.305
They're trying to, they didn't have a God who spoke.

460
00:25:05.325 --> 00:25:07.385
So they did that. That's what pagan nations did.

461
00:25:07.445 --> 00:25:09.705
It had no place in the people of God.

462
00:25:11.355 --> 00:25:15.255
In fact, the law said mediums

463
00:25:15.615 --> 00:25:17.535
necromancers were to be put to

464
00:25:18.605 --> 00:25:19.605
Death's. Why?

465
00:25:19.605 --> 00:25:20.945
This woman was so afraid, right?

466
00:25:21.355 --> 00:25:22.625
She's like, are you trapping me?

467
00:25:22.655 --> 00:25:25.665
Like you said, the king should know as Saul.

468
00:25:25.665 --> 00:25:28.705
Yet the king said, I'm supposed to be put out of the,

469
00:25:30.895 --> 00:25:31.735
I still make a lot of money

470
00:25:31.735 --> 00:25:32.975
doing this, so I'm still doing it.

471
00:25:32.995 --> 00:25:35.575
But you see this as dangerous, right?

472
00:25:37.855 --> 00:25:39.165
Which is in fact what Saul

473
00:25:39.445 --> 00:25:40.565
apparently believed to begin with.

474
00:25:40.685 --> 00:25:42.125
'cause he's the one who said all

475
00:25:42.125 --> 00:25:43.605
of them be put outta the land.

476
00:25:43.985 --> 00:25:48.655
Yet, in his desperation, what does he do?

477
00:25:49.975 --> 00:25:51.435
He breaks his own prohibition.

478
00:25:51.435 --> 00:25:55.035
He goes and finds this medium, and he sins.

479
00:25:59.635 --> 00:26:02.495
It was actually the final straw with God.

480
00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:09.665
First Chronicles reports it like this about Saul

481
00:26:10.375 --> 00:26:13.185
chapter 10 of one Chronicles says, Saul died

482
00:26:13.325 --> 00:26:14.945
for his breach of faith.

483
00:26:16.165 --> 00:26:18.345
He broke faith with the Lord in

484
00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:20.385
that he did not keep the command of the Lord.

485
00:26:20.395 --> 00:26:24.625
We've already seen that one. And also consulted a medium

486
00:26:25.975 --> 00:26:27.465
seeking guidance.

487
00:26:28.605 --> 00:26:30.665
And here's the kicker. He did not

488
00:26:30.935 --> 00:26:32.185
seek guidance from the Lord.

489
00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:36.875
Therefore, the Lord put him to death

490
00:26:37.615 --> 00:26:40.435
and turned the kingdom over to David, the son of Jesse.

491
00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:48.125
Again, this was a spiritual problem that Saul tried

492
00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:50.325
to use worldly means to answer.

493
00:26:53.285 --> 00:26:58.235
You ever done that before you ever had

494
00:26:58.235 --> 00:27:00.035
something in your soul that's not right,

495
00:27:00.135 --> 00:27:01.755
and you feel like I'm separated from God?

496
00:27:01.815 --> 00:27:05.635
I'm, I'm a little bit, it's a little drifting spiritually,

497
00:27:05.735 --> 00:27:09.835
and, and I'm gonna look for worldly answers to fix it.

498
00:27:11.595 --> 00:27:13.155
I, I have, I'm gonna share

499
00:27:13.155 --> 00:27:14.675
with you a little bit of my battle in this.

500
00:27:14.705 --> 00:27:16.355
This is just because maybe my brain,

501
00:27:16.465 --> 00:27:18.355
like engineering degree, those kind of things.

502
00:27:18.355 --> 00:27:21.075
Maybe this is how I work, but here's the problem.

503
00:27:21.225 --> 00:27:23.995
I'll, I'll feel spiritually dry, sometime

504
00:27:25.735 --> 00:27:28.705
undisciplined, spiritually, just kind

505
00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:30.865
of see 'em drifting away from the Lord a little bit.

506
00:27:30.885 --> 00:27:34.625
And, and instead of what it should be, here's

507
00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:38.345
where my mind will go, drifting undisciplined.

508
00:27:38.345 --> 00:27:40.465
Like, okay, I need a new planner.

509
00:27:41.655 --> 00:27:44.065
Like I, I need a new, I need a new system.

510
00:27:44.735 --> 00:27:46.705
Like I'm gonna write this. I gotta get my to-do

511
00:27:46.705 --> 00:27:47.785
list a calendar, right?

512
00:27:47.785 --> 00:27:48.905
Like, I'm just on discipline.

513
00:27:48.905 --> 00:27:51.425
I gotta figure out a way to order my day better, right?

514
00:27:51.425 --> 00:27:53.305
Like, that's how may be productive, right?

515
00:27:53.365 --> 00:27:55.825
No, like it's a spiritual problem.

516
00:27:55.825 --> 00:27:57.825
Like I, I'm completely missing the point here.

517
00:27:58.125 --> 00:28:00.225
My problem is in here.

518
00:28:00.495 --> 00:28:03.865
It's not about systems and paper and calendars.

519
00:28:04.055 --> 00:28:05.305
None of that's my problem.

520
00:28:05.735 --> 00:28:09.105
What I need is that my love has grown cold.

521
00:28:09.465 --> 00:28:12.865
I need to run back to my father and find hope

522
00:28:12.925 --> 00:28:15.145
and joy in life in abiding in him.

523
00:28:15.145 --> 00:28:17.705
That's my problem. It has nothing to do

524
00:28:17.705 --> 00:28:19.225
with my calendar at all.

525
00:28:19.295 --> 00:28:23.875
It's all about in here the spiritual problem I'm trying

526
00:28:23.875 --> 00:28:25.955
to fix with a worldly means

527
00:28:26.825 --> 00:28:28.915
it's a spiritual problem.

528
00:28:31.745 --> 00:28:33.295
Maybe you don't relate to that one, okay?

529
00:28:34.785 --> 00:28:36.655
Maybe you're dissatisfied with your life

530
00:28:37.725 --> 00:28:41.375
because you have heard over

531
00:28:41.635 --> 00:28:43.015
and over thousands

532
00:28:43.015 --> 00:28:45.495
of different reasons why you should be dissatisfied

533
00:28:45.495 --> 00:28:48.655
with your life because you don't look the right way.

534
00:28:48.885 --> 00:28:50.615
Your relationship's not right,

535
00:28:50.755 --> 00:28:52.455
or you don't have a relationship or,

536
00:28:52.595 --> 00:28:55.015
or your job's less than ideal.

537
00:28:55.395 --> 00:28:56.935
And so you're like, man, I'm dissatisfied.

538
00:28:56.995 --> 00:28:59.495
The world is constantly tossing dis.

539
00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:02.215
Every commercial you watch on TV is

540
00:29:02.215 --> 00:29:03.735
because it's trying to create

541
00:29:04.355 --> 00:29:06.575
dissatisfaction in you in something.

542
00:29:06.675 --> 00:29:07.855
And so that's what you feel.

543
00:29:08.275 --> 00:29:12.335
Yet, instead of turning to God and his word

544
00:29:12.475 --> 00:29:16.735
and abiding in him for satisfaction, we instead turn

545
00:29:16.875 --> 00:29:19.135
to TikTok or to self-help books

546
00:29:19.315 --> 00:29:21.015
or whatever else, thinking, well,

547
00:29:21.015 --> 00:29:22.295
this is gonna be the answer.

548
00:29:22.505 --> 00:29:26.135
Maybe this little 92nd clip will solve all my problems.

549
00:29:29.475 --> 00:29:31.735
And it's worldly means to try

550
00:29:31.735 --> 00:29:34.215
to solve what's really a spiritual problem inside me

551
00:29:34.215 --> 00:29:37.575
that I'm dissatisfied with God, not with my life.

552
00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:45.105
Now, you might get a snippet here and there

553
00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:48.155
because all truth is God's truth.

554
00:29:48.155 --> 00:29:49.235
Like there might be something you

555
00:29:49.235 --> 00:29:50.395
catch, like, yeah, that, that works.

556
00:29:50.775 --> 00:29:53.355
It will not sustain you though,

557
00:29:55.545 --> 00:29:59.275
like a relationship with God Almighty does

558
00:30:03.395 --> 00:30:05.535
beware of searching

559
00:30:05.535 --> 00:30:07.375
for worldly answers to spiritual problems.

560
00:30:11.945 --> 00:30:14.045
Here's the second application from Saul's life.

561
00:30:14.115 --> 00:30:18.105
Similar, it's

562
00:30:18.105 --> 00:30:20.945
that it will get very dark while you are sinning.

563
00:30:21.645 --> 00:30:25.445
It will get very dark

564
00:30:27.145 --> 00:30:31.095
while you are walking down a path of sin.

565
00:30:32.465 --> 00:30:36.965
All of chapter 28 is an illustration of this at here,

566
00:30:36.965 --> 00:30:38.005
at the end of Saul's life.

567
00:30:38.355 --> 00:30:41.845
This is just the capstone, the final step.

568
00:30:43.705 --> 00:30:45.595
It's all about darkness. Did you see that?

569
00:30:48.575 --> 00:30:51.275
He, in verse six, he says, God's not speaking to me.

570
00:30:51.635 --> 00:30:54.195
I, I think God's abandoned me. What does that feel like?

571
00:30:54.225 --> 00:30:55.235
That feels like darkness.

572
00:30:56.095 --> 00:30:57.955
He feels like he's walking around in darkness

573
00:30:57.955 --> 00:30:59.875
because he has no ability to hear from God.

574
00:31:00.135 --> 00:31:04.715
And then he goes to this woman under the cover of darkness

575
00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:09.985
at night, he disguises himself in a dark way

576
00:31:10.245 --> 00:31:11.545
so that no one can see him.

577
00:31:11.605 --> 00:31:12.945
No one knows who he is.

578
00:31:13.125 --> 00:31:18.065
And then the message he received is not a positive one.

579
00:31:19.115 --> 00:31:20.565
It's a very dark message, right?

580
00:31:20.905 --> 00:31:23.405
You have had the kingdom ripped away from you

581
00:31:23.545 --> 00:31:24.805
and you're gonna die tomorrow.

582
00:31:27.325 --> 00:31:29.105
And then at the end, he leaves

583
00:31:30.235 --> 00:31:31.825
still under the cover of darkness.

584
00:31:35.055 --> 00:31:38.585
This chapter 28 is just the final straw.

585
00:31:39.005 --> 00:31:41.265
But this was the trajectory we've

586
00:31:41.265 --> 00:31:42.545
been watching of Saul's life, right?

587
00:31:44.175 --> 00:31:46.985
This has been the whole time he started up here.

588
00:31:47.325 --> 00:31:50.465
He was so anointed and high, all this great things.

589
00:31:50.845 --> 00:31:52.945
He was expected to be this amazing man.

590
00:31:53.005 --> 00:31:54.785
And then he just step by step

591
00:31:55.085 --> 00:31:57.705
by step into the darkness deeper

592
00:31:58.125 --> 00:32:01.025
and deeper from the time he rebelled against God's command,

593
00:32:01.125 --> 00:32:03.625
he went further and further and further into it.

594
00:32:05.825 --> 00:32:10.285
He was trying to hunt and kill David multiple times.

595
00:32:10.745 --> 00:32:13.645
He cast off God's plan, God's law.

596
00:32:13.715 --> 00:32:17.565
Even we saw it here, the final straw, this forbidden woman

597
00:32:17.675 --> 00:32:21.205
that he goes into to, into her house to get her

598
00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:22.285
to tell him something.

599
00:32:22.475 --> 00:32:23.845
He's so desperate. He's trying

600
00:32:23.845 --> 00:32:25.645
to get Samuel to answer for him.

601
00:32:25.785 --> 00:32:27.205
He has no clue what's going on.

602
00:32:27.355 --> 00:32:30.485
He's that far into the darkness.

603
00:32:35.115 --> 00:32:37.415
But that's always the trajectory of sin, isn't it?

604
00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:42.975
Like darkness, sin

605
00:32:43.685 --> 00:32:47.335
doesn't get better, it doesn't get lighter.

606
00:32:47.675 --> 00:32:52.255
The farther you go down that path, that is the trajectory

607
00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:53.735
of sin.

608
00:32:55.475 --> 00:32:57.355
I know, I know.

609
00:32:57.535 --> 00:33:01.035
Sin always promises to make life better.

610
00:33:02.565 --> 00:33:04.545
It promises to make life more pleasurable,

611
00:33:04.685 --> 00:33:06.345
to make life more fulfilling.

612
00:33:07.405 --> 00:33:09.905
We wouldn't sin if it didn't feel good for a while.

613
00:33:11.075 --> 00:33:12.945
We're hedonists at heart, right? You know that.

614
00:33:13.695 --> 00:33:15.305
Like, I'm not gonna do this if it doesn't feel good

615
00:33:15.305 --> 00:33:18.185
or doesn't sustain me for a second, for a while.

616
00:33:18.345 --> 00:33:21.065
I wouldn't do it if it, but it's so sin does, right?

617
00:33:21.085 --> 00:33:22.505
It it, it does.

618
00:33:25.335 --> 00:33:26.915
But, but here's one you might wanna write down.

619
00:33:26.915 --> 00:33:28.075
This is not original to me.

620
00:33:28.735 --> 00:33:31.075
Sin always over promises

621
00:33:31.415 --> 00:33:35.855
and under delivers every single time.

622
00:33:38.095 --> 00:33:41.435
It offers overpromising something

623
00:33:41.855 --> 00:33:45.715
and underdelivering every single time.

624
00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:49.395
The enemy loves the bait and switch game, right?

625
00:33:49.395 --> 00:33:50.395
You know, like you go fishing

626
00:33:50.655 --> 00:33:52.075
and you toss the lure out there,

627
00:33:52.255 --> 00:33:54.235
it sure looks like a nice little worm that

628
00:33:54.235 --> 00:33:56.035
that bass is gonna come up, it's gonna take it,

629
00:33:56.095 --> 00:33:59.515
and it's promising something, sustaining a meal,

630
00:33:59.955 --> 00:34:01.755
whatever it is, what's inside that worm?

631
00:34:02.995 --> 00:34:06.825
A hook. So it tosses the lure

632
00:34:06.885 --> 00:34:09.065
and the listen, the enemy is tossing lures left

633
00:34:09.065 --> 00:34:12.745
and right at us every single day with hooks inside.

634
00:34:12.925 --> 00:34:16.425
So when you bite on it, he sets the hook and he's got you.

635
00:34:19.375 --> 00:34:20.795
It always over promises

636
00:34:20.955 --> 00:34:24.865
and under delivers, it will destroy

637
00:34:28.385 --> 00:34:30.805
sin might feel pleasurable for a season.

638
00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:32.085
It might look appealing.

639
00:34:32.085 --> 00:34:33.845
It might look like this is the right way to go,

640
00:34:34.145 --> 00:34:35.405
but it will only lead

641
00:34:35.405 --> 00:34:37.805
to increasing darkness the further you go in it.

642
00:34:41.495 --> 00:34:43.155
And I know, listen, I've been there.

643
00:34:43.875 --> 00:34:45.235
I know what some

644
00:34:45.235 --> 00:34:48.715
of you right now are feeling when you're walking day

645
00:34:48.775 --> 00:34:49.995
by day in that darkness

646
00:34:50.175 --> 00:34:53.035
and you know, you, you feel like there is no way out.

647
00:35:01.475 --> 00:35:03.525
There's a, there's a sunk cost fallacy

648
00:35:05.795 --> 00:35:06.885
that we feel like,

649
00:35:06.885 --> 00:35:09.925
because I've already gone down a little bit of that path,

650
00:35:10.245 --> 00:35:11.565
I might as well just go all the way.

651
00:35:13.045 --> 00:35:14.785
You've sunk some of the costs already.

652
00:35:14.785 --> 00:35:15.985
Like, well, I've already sinned.

653
00:35:16.145 --> 00:35:17.625
I might as well just keep going in it.

654
00:35:17.625 --> 00:35:19.305
Might as well just keep doing it like that.

655
00:35:23.305 --> 00:35:26.685
If you have already begun to walk down a path of darkness,

656
00:35:28.735 --> 00:35:30.675
you, you get nothing else today.

657
00:35:30.675 --> 00:35:34.235
Hear this, you don't have to keep going down that path.

658
00:35:34.235 --> 00:35:35.355
If you're in the kingdom of God,

659
00:35:35.845 --> 00:35:39.665
There, There is nothing making you

660
00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:41.545
continue that path.

661
00:35:41.685 --> 00:35:44.385
You don't have to listen there.

662
00:35:44.385 --> 00:35:46.305
There's a truth in one Corinthians 10 13.

663
00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:48.905
No temptation has seized you except

664
00:35:48.905 --> 00:35:50.425
what is common to all of us.

665
00:35:51.205 --> 00:35:53.105
But God is faithful him, not let you be tempted beyond

666
00:35:53.105 --> 00:35:55.945
what you can bear, meaning what He strengthen you to handle.

667
00:35:56.365 --> 00:36:00.065
And he will always provide a way out.

668
00:36:01.665 --> 00:36:05.015
Every time you're tempted, there's a way out.

669
00:36:06.595 --> 00:36:10.085
We just have to look for it, and we have to want it.

670
00:36:11.815 --> 00:36:13.675
Sin is pleasurable. You don't want it often,

671
00:36:13.895 --> 00:36:16.075
but there is a way

672
00:36:16.695 --> 00:36:19.415
out in God's power.

673
00:36:19.415 --> 00:36:23.055
There's always a way out. Saul's life is a tragic picture

674
00:36:23.355 --> 00:36:24.655
of having an opportunity

675
00:36:24.785 --> 00:36:29.015
after opportunity to turn back to God, to exit strategy,

676
00:36:29.235 --> 00:36:31.855
his darkness, to just abdicate his throne

677
00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:33.255
and say, David, okay, you're the king.

678
00:36:33.435 --> 00:36:34.735
I'm out. He gets a position.

679
00:36:34.875 --> 00:36:37.935
We don't know how that would've played out, but he never

680
00:36:38.595 --> 00:36:39.595
Did.

681
00:36:40.575 --> 00:36:42.835
He kept walking the path of darkness,

682
00:36:42.895 --> 00:36:47.195
and he destroyed his life and his son's life as a result.

683
00:36:51.665 --> 00:36:54.085
And so, man, it, it's dark.

684
00:36:54.585 --> 00:36:56.965
Saul's life is a picture of darkness

685
00:36:59.685 --> 00:37:02.225
and it's a, a, a darkness that a lot of us

686
00:37:03.865 --> 00:37:06.115
Have Or are walking in right now.

687
00:37:09.165 --> 00:37:10.165
And so here's

688
00:37:11.525 --> 00:37:13.665
My hope is

689
00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:16.505
That in light of how dark sin is

690
00:37:16.685 --> 00:37:21.025
and how dark our path often is, I also want to share

691
00:37:21.295 --> 00:37:23.545
with the third application that has hope

692
00:37:23.615 --> 00:37:26.345
that we can see the gospel very clearly.

693
00:37:26.845 --> 00:37:27.905
Now because of it,

694
00:37:28.085 --> 00:37:31.305
the final application actually looks forward from Saul.

695
00:37:31.405 --> 00:37:36.145
The anti-hero to the true hero is that Jesus experienced

696
00:37:36.785 --> 00:37:38.865
darkness so that we wouldn't have to

697
00:37:43.825 --> 00:37:46.895
Jesus experienced darkness so

698
00:37:46.895 --> 00:37:49.855
that we would not have to anymore.

699
00:37:52.915 --> 00:37:56.815
Now, we don't know if Saul truly was

700
00:37:58.145 --> 00:38:02.015
God's or not, that that's not mine to judge.

701
00:38:02.175 --> 00:38:04.135
I can't see his heart. That's between him and God.

702
00:38:04.375 --> 00:38:07.895
I don't know if he truly is a believer of filled with faith.

703
00:38:08.095 --> 00:38:11.385
I don't know. That's between him and God.

704
00:38:11.565 --> 00:38:15.545
But what we do know very clearly is that Saul persisting

705
00:38:15.765 --> 00:38:20.185
to turn away from God, led to God appearing

706
00:38:20.325 --> 00:38:21.425
to abandon him.

707
00:38:24.485 --> 00:38:28.635
You don't want me anymore. You got it.

708
00:38:31.895 --> 00:38:33.945
Like, that's how God works, right? We, he won't.

709
00:38:35.835 --> 00:38:37.445
Someone who doesn't want God

710
00:38:37.635 --> 00:38:38.925
will not be one of God's people.

711
00:38:40.235 --> 00:38:42.615
God changes his hearts. God makes you want him.

712
00:38:43.875 --> 00:38:47.215
And so Saul persisted, abandoning God,

713
00:38:47.355 --> 00:38:49.295
and so God abandoned him.

714
00:38:52.175 --> 00:38:54.635
And that's every case we've seen over

715
00:38:54.875 --> 00:38:55.995
and over throughout history.

716
00:38:56.255 --> 00:38:58.035
You abandoned God. You say forget you

717
00:38:58.055 --> 00:38:59.275
God, and he a abandons you.

718
00:38:59.415 --> 00:39:03.955
But there's one, There's one massive

719
00:39:04.225 --> 00:39:08.555
case where someone was forsaken

720
00:39:08.815 --> 00:39:13.315
by God in spite of the fact that they never abandoned him

721
00:39:13.585 --> 00:39:16.765
Once. And it

722
00:39:17.465 --> 00:39:19.285
Is the very reason that we

723
00:39:19.285 --> 00:39:23.005
who are in Christ today can have hope, that we will not

724
00:39:23.225 --> 00:39:27.925
and cannot ever experience abandonment by God in our lives.

725
00:39:28.075 --> 00:39:32.845
It's the fact that Jesus went to the cross track with this.

726
00:39:32.855 --> 00:39:36.925
Watch this Jesus, his whole life was lived in light, right?

727
00:39:36.985 --> 00:39:38.445
He said, I am the light of the world.

728
00:39:38.555 --> 00:39:40.485
He's living in light, perfect lifestyle,

729
00:39:40.485 --> 00:39:42.125
perfect communion with his father.

730
00:39:42.125 --> 00:39:45.325
Everything is perfect. He's walking in light every single

731
00:39:45.505 --> 00:39:46.765
moment of his life.

732
00:39:47.025 --> 00:39:48.685
But then think about how dark it got

733
00:39:48.685 --> 00:39:52.625
For him at the end, the night

734
00:39:53.005 --> 00:39:55.265
Before he was crucified. He's in a dark

735
00:39:55.365 --> 00:39:58.745
Garden, and in that he's praying, God,

736
00:39:58.745 --> 00:40:00.225
Take this cup away from me

737
00:40:00.225 --> 00:40:02.265
because I know the darkness that comes with it.

738
00:40:02.495 --> 00:40:05.225
This, the wrath of God poured out on me like

739
00:40:05.265 --> 00:40:06.305
I know that's coming.

740
00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:09.865
And then he's nailed to the cross where three hours

741
00:40:10.005 --> 00:40:13.345
of the day was total darkness over the land.

742
00:40:14.125 --> 00:40:18.985
And in that, he on the cross cries out, my God, my God,

743
00:40:19.405 --> 00:40:21.785
why have you forsaken me?

744
00:40:27.335 --> 00:40:28.335
Think about it.

745
00:40:29.345 --> 00:40:30.715
That was supposed to be us up

746
00:40:30.715 --> 00:40:31.715
There on that cross, right?

747
00:40:33.755 --> 00:40:35.735
That's us. We deserve that.

748
00:40:36.435 --> 00:40:39.615
We deserve to be abandoned by a holy God

749
00:40:39.615 --> 00:40:42.895
because we have rebelled and turned our back over and over

750
00:40:42.915 --> 00:40:44.055
and over against him.

751
00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:47.455
We have said no to him over and over and over.

752
00:40:50.205 --> 00:40:53.665
Yet this is the good news of the gospel, that

753
00:40:53.665 --> 00:40:57.985
because Jesus was willing to endure the darkness

754
00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:02.385
of God's wrath, the darkness of God's abandonment for us,

755
00:41:02.845 --> 00:41:05.385
we can now walk in the light of Jesus forever.

756
00:41:07.405 --> 00:41:09.935
Like we don't have to remain in darkness ever anymore.

757
00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:13.295
Like not just future forever, like today,

758
00:41:14.615 --> 00:41:16.345
because he experienced it for us.

759
00:41:16.605 --> 00:41:18.385
He defeated it for us.

760
00:41:18.565 --> 00:41:21.905
So we can walk in light today, second Corinthians five,

761
00:41:22.125 --> 00:41:24.945
for our sake, he made him who knew no sin

762
00:41:25.165 --> 00:41:28.065
to be sin on our behalf, so that in him,

763
00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.585
we might become the righteousness of

764
00:41:29.585 --> 00:41:30.585
God.

765
00:41:31.235 --> 00:41:34.165
Not just righteousness one day, righteousness today,

766
00:41:34.315 --> 00:41:36.845
that you are not darkness believer.

767
00:41:38.145 --> 00:41:39.965
You don't have to walk in darkness believer

768
00:41:41.755 --> 00:41:42.775
he is the light of the world.

769
00:41:42.835 --> 00:41:46.775
He is light in. This is the light that God offers us.

770
00:41:46.875 --> 00:41:51.655
Church, that's what Isaiah said thousands of years ago.

771
00:41:51.655 --> 00:41:53.775
He said, those who walk in great darkness have

772
00:41:53.775 --> 00:41:54.815
seen a great light.

773
00:41:56.185 --> 00:41:59.255
Who's the light? The light is Jesus Christ.

774
00:42:00.155 --> 00:42:03.135
The light is the perfect one who took our place so

775
00:42:03.135 --> 00:42:05.655
that we could be free from the darkness.

776
00:42:05.835 --> 00:42:07.935
We don't have to be chained up by it anymore.

777
00:42:08.115 --> 00:42:09.655
That's great news, isn't it?

778
00:42:09.655 --> 00:42:12.795
Church, like for sinners like you and me.

779
00:42:14.215 --> 00:42:18.425
We need this. We need this.

780
00:42:20.605 --> 00:42:22.265
So I just wanna invite us now

781
00:42:23.165 --> 00:42:24.585
to enter into a spirit of prayer.

782
00:42:26.325 --> 00:42:30.465
As, as you consider, as we consider, as we think, I,

783
00:42:30.545 --> 00:42:35.085
I want us to just acknowledge

784
00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:37.445
what God is doing, rest in what He's doing, and

785
00:42:37.545 --> 00:42:41.005
and really consider what he is doing among us right now.

786
00:42:42.775 --> 00:42:43.835
I'm gonna invite our worship leaders

787
00:42:43.855 --> 00:42:45.835
to come out while we do this,

788
00:42:46.055 --> 00:42:49.915
but just in a spirit of prayer,

789
00:42:49.975 --> 00:42:50.955
I'm gonna ask a couple questions

790
00:42:54.915 --> 00:42:57.415
and, and these are questions that we all need to consider

791
00:42:58.875 --> 00:43:00.815
in light of what God has done today.

792
00:43:04.895 --> 00:43:07.635
And so just humble yourself right now before the Lord.

793
00:43:12.485 --> 00:43:15.505
Ask him to show you first

794
00:43:17.045 --> 00:43:19.985
how you have looked for worldly answers to spiritual things.

795
00:43:22.535 --> 00:43:24.195
How you've trusted the ways of the world

796
00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:29.595
instead of trusting him and his ways.

797
00:43:30.585 --> 00:43:32.195
Have you done that? How?

798
00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:43.475
Just run back to him in that say,

799
00:43:43.475 --> 00:43:44.555
God, forgive me for that.

800
00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:46.995
I've, I've never trusted you for this.

801
00:43:47.155 --> 00:43:49.835
I, I have trusted my own talents and abilities

802
00:43:49.855 --> 00:43:51.795
and resources instead of trusting you.

803
00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:55.635
Forgive me. He wants to

804
00:43:56.535 --> 00:43:57.995
be your stronghold.

805
00:44:00.085 --> 00:44:00.635
Trust him.

806
00:44:07.535 --> 00:44:10.515
Or maybe you really are walking in darkness right now,

807
00:44:13.215 --> 00:44:14.475
and it feels so hopeless.

808
00:44:15.415 --> 00:44:17.275
It feels like you can't ever get out of it.

809
00:44:17.275 --> 00:44:18.315
There's no way out.

810
00:44:22.235 --> 00:44:24.515
I hope you've seen today hope

811
00:44:27.745 --> 00:44:29.115
that you don't have to stay there.

812
00:44:30.815 --> 00:44:34.245
You don't have to find this resigned

813
00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:35.805
spirit to be in the darkness.

814
00:44:35.805 --> 00:44:40.525
You can walk in light the light of Jesus,

815
00:44:42.185 --> 00:44:43.565
the defeater of darkness.

816
00:44:45.345 --> 00:44:50.325
So run to him in faith, in that cry out, say, God,

817
00:44:50.405 --> 00:44:54.485
I need you to rip this darkness outta me to change my heart.

818
00:44:55.645 --> 00:44:58.845
I see that you are the savior and you can free me from this.

819
00:44:58.905 --> 00:45:01.485
God, do it and just cry out to him in that.

820
00:45:09.865 --> 00:45:11.805
Or maybe this one, this is, this was mine.

821
00:45:13.855 --> 00:45:15.645
Maybe you've just become numb

822
00:45:17.945 --> 00:45:21.085
to the glorious grace and mercy of God for you

823
00:45:26.185 --> 00:45:27.205
not do anything too bad.

824
00:45:27.205 --> 00:45:31.045
You're just drifting numb and it doesn't move your spirit.

825
00:45:36.875 --> 00:45:38.645
Just ask him right now.

826
00:45:38.985 --> 00:45:42.765
God, awaken my stir, my affections for you

827
00:45:44.385 --> 00:45:47.165
to see your carrying

828
00:45:47.225 --> 00:45:49.645
of the darkness for my light.

829
00:45:52.145 --> 00:45:54.925
And run to him in that in humble submission.

830
00:45:56.535 --> 00:46:01.245
Enjoy God. Ask him, God, give me, give me a

831
00:46:03.955 --> 00:46:07.525
restore restored joy of your selfish.
