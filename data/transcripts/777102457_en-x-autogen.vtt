00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.300
Well, it's great to see you tonight friends. This is

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.200
the kickoff to our Advent season Christmas

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.300
season and some of you might be a little unfamiliar with

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.000
that word Advent. It has Latin roots

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.600
and it really just means appearing or

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.500
coming and so the idea is that

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.500
in the context of Christianity. It represents a

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.000
couple different things. It represents first how we talk

9
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.700
about it in terms of the Old Testament Saints who were looking

10
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.700
forward to longing for waiting for the

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.200
Messiah to come which we now

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.300
know and celebrate in in Christ. Jesus being born,

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.900
right? That's that's the idea that we can look back and and join

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.600
with them as they were waiting for it. But also

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500
as we're going to see over the next few weeks, it's more than just kind of

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.200
identifying with them and they're waiting there's more to it

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.300
than that. There's an element that we are still

18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.900
waiting, too.

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.000
Now we're still waiting in a sense for Christ's second Advent.

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.400
His second appearing his second coming.

21
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
and that many of the same things that they were waiting for back in

22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.800
the Old Testament waiting for that Messiah to bring

23
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.600
and things that we might even see glimpses of today. We're

24
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.500
actually still waiting for our hearts are longing

25
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200
for them to come in full.

26
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.700
And we'll see glimpses of these things but in full later and

27
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.900
that is what we're celebrating with the word Advent in

28
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.300
this season.

29
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't know about you, but it was a bit of a mind shift. I had

30
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.100
to turn on my my Christmas season in my head

31
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.300
even as we're seeing those songs. It took me a second to catch on that. We're

32
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.100
actually in Christmas now, but but Thanksgiving is

33
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.600
over and so here we are at Christmas if you played Christmas before Thanksgiving,

34
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.300
I'm sorry. That's your it's a problem. I

35
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
don't know about for you. But for me it is now we're into Christmas. And

36
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.400
so here we are as we go now what has traditionally

37
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.900
been used to Mark these weeks leading up to Christmas is

38
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.100
this sort of Advent wreath of

39
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.400
various forms of that. It's what's called an Advent

40
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.600
wreath and it has these candles that are lighted weekly

41
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.400
leading up to and kind of preparing our hearts

42
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.400
for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

43
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.700
And here's why we have a physical symbol

44
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.300
like this. It has it really no meaning in itself. But

45
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.600
it's it's a symbol of that anticipation as we

46
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.700
think ahead to each candle being lighted. It

47
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.200
keeps our minds on what it means for Jesus to be

48
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.800
born that there was a sense you think about the

49
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.200
Testament they were they were looking ahead looking forward we're doing the

50
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.300
same thing looking forward and there's there's an anticipation of

51
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.000
that middle candle being lighted at some point,

52
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.300
which is the one that simply symbolizes Jesus.

53
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.700
But they they felt waiting they felt anticipation. We

54
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.200
feel the same way.

55
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.400
But what it also points us to and this is what we hope this gets us

56
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.700
towards as we have this out for the next few weeks is we

57
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.300
hope that it reminds us that what we're longing for and what we're waiting for

58
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.800
with Christmas has nothing to do with toys or gifts.

59
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.400
or stuff in any way

60
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.500
it has everything to do with What A Savior

61
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.000
alone could do for us.

62
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.800
That every one of us has the same need that what we need most is

63
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.600
this salvation from our sins and that's what

64
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.800
we anticipate coming in Jesus. We celebrate has

65
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.400
come in Jesus as he came to do

66
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.700
exactly that thing that we needed.

67
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.600
So Advent, as I said positions are hearts

68
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.200
in the longing that the Old Testament Saints would have felt

69
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.500
we can identify and position our hearts there but

70
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.300
it also points us forward to what we are longing for as well

71
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.300
our full salvation one day where

72
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.500
we're out of this that we're in right now.

73
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.200
That the fullness of these things God's promise will one day be

74
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.300
fulfilled in full.

75
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.200
And it'll be fully promised and fully accomplished and

76
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.400
we have reason to believe it's on its way. We we've seen things but

77
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.200
it's not yet here.

78
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.000
And so we wait we watch and that's

79
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.200
Advent.

80
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.300
And so as we walk through the next couple weeks talking about these

81
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.700
specific words as we study at this way. Let

82
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.800
the Lord stir your heart.

83
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.000
to a sense of

84
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.100
Strength for today and bright. Hope for tomorrow.

85
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.700
Because of what he's done and what he will do.

86
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.100
In fact, that's the first word hope that we're going to study in this

87
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.300
Advent season tonight. We're going to look at Hope and so take your coffee of

88
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.500
God's word and turn with me to Matthew chapter 12.

89
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.300
Matthew chapter 12 if you didn't bring yours, there's one underneath one

90
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.500
of the seats in front of you potentially.

91
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.000
somewhere around you

92
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.500
But Matthew chapter 12 is where we're going to be looking starting

93
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.800
in verse 15 at this concept of

94
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.200
Hope.

95
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.400
Now that concept of Hope is pretty misunderstood in our world today.

96
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.500
We use the word. Hope a lot when we're talking about sports. For example,

97
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.600
like I really hope the Thunder win.

98
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.300
Pretty doubtful this year, but you know like you hope that

99
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.500
they win or or even like I hope that I get that scholarship

100
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.300
that you're looking for from school or

101
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.600
I hope that I get that promotion at work. There's there's

102
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.500
this this word hope that we use but it has this air

103
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.600
of uncertainty, doesn't it?

104
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.100
It's like man, I don't really know if it's gonna happen. I hope it

105
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.700
does that's how we use the word a lot, but biblical hope.

106
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.600
Is very different.

107
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
I love how the Bible project puts this where it talks about how the Hebrew

108
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.700
words for Hope do involve a

109
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.200
measure of waiting. Like like Noah in

110
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.500
the ark the word used. There is that he was waiting for the end, right? So

111
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.600
you just sitting there kind of

112
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.100
Waiting it out and he's waiting on God. Yes, but he's

113
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.300
waiting it out. That's one sense of the word. But the other one

114
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.700
the main word kava. The picture

115
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.800
is like a chord that is pulled tight and

116
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.400
there's a tension in it until you release it.

117
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.400
So think of a Bungie cord where you've you've pulled it tight and there's a

118
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.100
tension there. There's an expectation you feel until

119
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.200
something happens till something

120
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.800
changes.

121
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.500
That's the idea of of hope

122
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.100
that we're talking about with Advent. But but

123
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.100
here's the thing in both cases, whether it's the chord pulled tight

124
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.100
or whether it's no waiting.

125
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.700
That hope is fixed on a person.

126
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.300
Every time it's used in scripture. It's talking

127
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.000
about it fixed on a person you're waiting on something and

128
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.100
it's that thing is God.

129
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.500
The words for Hope are most often used in a crisis.

130
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.600
When nothing else is going right they have

131
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.300
to wait on God.

132
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.500
That even when there's no evidence things will get better you wait on

133
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.400
God that word. Wait is the same word for hope that's that's

134
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.600
the same in expectation that you've got this tightened out.

135
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.400
You're waiting to see what's going to happen.

136
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.200
That's the idea of Hope and a prophet in

137
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.000
the Old Testament named Jose is a great example of this.

138
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.300
See Hosea was facing the same

139
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.300
kind of trouble we've seen in Micah that Micah was facing over

140
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.300
those last few months. We walked through that book that that there were

141
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.400
these enemy and Nations entering the land and trying to take over

142
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.500
and they're pressing in and he was seeing it all around

143
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.400
him yet Hosea instead of worrying or

144
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.300
fearing he chose to Hope in God.

145
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.300
Because he prophesied this in Hebrews 215 that

146
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.400
God would turn the valley of trouble.

147
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.700
into a door of Hope

148
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.000
That's that word kava that that sense of

149
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.400
expectation waiting hoping.

150
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.100
The cord was pulled tight that God was going

151
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.300
to do something here. God was working this out. And so

152
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.200
he's expectant in that.

153
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.200
And here's how Jose do that. How did Hosea know that

154
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.600
so confidently because he looked back to the Exodus.

155
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.000
He looked back to what God had done to deliver his people out of

156
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.300
Egypt. He said God did it once God can do it again.

157
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.300
God had redeemed his people out of Egypt before surely he can

158
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.500
do it again. God can work like that again, so I'm expectant.

159
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.200
I'm waiting. I'm hoping.

160
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.100
In fact, that's the basis.

161
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.300
for all of our hope

162
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.100
It's God's past faithfulness that motivates

163
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.700
our future expectation.

164
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.600
We look forwardly by looking backwardly.

165
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.000
Like we look forward by looking backwards by

166
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.700
looking at what God has done. You

167
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.300
don't trust in the circumstances you face right now you

168
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.800
trust in God's character.

169
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.200
That's what gives you hope.

170
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.300
When you're facing whatever you face, that's what we're seeing here

171
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.400
in Matthew 12.

172
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.600
Now as a quick context this passage right before this passage

173
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.400
we're going to read today is that Jesus went into the synagogue and

174
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.000
he healed a man on the Sabbath day.

175
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.200
And the religious leaders, they came after Jesus when they saw him

176
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.400
do this and and they tried to trap Jesus which by

177
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.200
the way anytime you try to trap Jesus a bad idea.

178
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.600
But but that's what they were trying to do. And so what Jesus showed them

179
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.900
he flipped it and he said it's actually right to do

180
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.400
good on the Sabbath, isn't it? Like don't

181
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.400
you agree with me Pharisees they had

182
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.200
to of course.

183
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.500
and so they began to conspire against Jesus and

184
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.100
that leads us to the Cross eventually but right after

185
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.600
what he does he we see Matthew

186
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.600
record this Matthew 12 verse 15 down to

187
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.000
verse 21

188
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.200
Jesus aware of this this conspiring this

189
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.400
conspiring against him he withdrew from there and many

190
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.500
followed him and he healed them all and he

191
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.900
ordered them not to make him known.

192
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.600
And this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah.

193
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.700
Behold my servant whom I've chosen my beloved

194
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.500
with whom my soul is well pleased. I will

195
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.400
put my spirit upon Him He will Proclaim Justice to the

196
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.800
Gentiles. He will not quarrel or cry aloud nor

197
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.900
will anyone here is voice in the streets a bruised

198
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.200
Reed. He will not break a smoldering Wick he

199
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.700
will not quench until he brings Justice to Victory

200
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.200
and in his name the Gentiles

201
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.500
will

202
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.400
hope

203
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.300
That's the word they will hope now. This

204
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.900
is nearly a direct quote from Isaiah 42.

205
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.500
Which Isaiah predicted about the Messiah 700

206
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.100
years before Jesus showed up

207
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.000
and said this was what he was going to be like and so right away Matthew's showing

208
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.200
Jesus fulfills the prophecies. That

209
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.000
was Matthew's argument. He's saying Jesus is this Messiah

210
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.600
folks but notice how and

211
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.200
when Matthew does this?

212
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.900
He positions this this Messianic fulfillment

213
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.600
in the middle.

214
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.200
Of Jesus healing people and declaring freedom

215
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.800
from the Sabbath law this

216
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.200
legalistic interpretation of it that the

217
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.100
Pharisees had been doing.

218
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.400
He's going to heal and he's going to reinterpret the law. And and then

219
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.700
he also says not just is this Messiah coming

220
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.900
for the Jewish people? He's coming for the Gentiles as

221
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.100
well twice. He mentions that

222
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.500
now the Gentiles remember those are the people who are non-ethnically Jewish.

223
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.800
That means anybody who's not Israel is a

224
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.100
gentile.

225
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.700
And so in Matthew saying here is this prophesied

226
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.300
Messiah was coming to bring Justice to

227
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.100
the Gentiles.

228
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.100
Now when you hear he's bringing Justice to someone that means

229
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.600
by definition there's an injustice happening, right?

230
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.400
It's got to bring Justice to them because they're not getting Justice right

231
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.200
now is Injustice happening.

232
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.300
Well, what were they experiencing did Gentiles remember

233
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:35.900
we're cut off?

234
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.800
from the hope of Israel

235
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.100
They had lesser access to God in the

236
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.400
temple. They had lesser access to God in other ways. And so

237
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.700
they had no hope.

238
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.100
In fact the Greek word in the New Testament that is used for

239
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.900
despair.

240
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.200
Is actually the word a compound word

241
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.000
that says away from Hope.

242
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.300
Like the Gentiles were Cast Away from hope so they were despairing when

243
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.200
they had hope as Israel that they

244
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.800
were hoarding a little here.

245
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.200
But Matthew says that's not the way the Messiah is going to

246
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.400
be. He's going to be God's representative. He's going to be the one who would

247
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.400
not cast off the Gentiles but he would instead gently and

248
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.600
Tenderly and quietly and carefully care for

249
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.900
and restore those who were lost.

250
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.200
That would be Justice.

251
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.500
Because it would align with God's right way with God's heart

252
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.500
for the Nations. We've seen this if you've been around church here for

253
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.300
any length of time you've seen as we go back to the very beginning

254
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.200
of Genesis. This is God's heart. He's for the

255
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.500
Nations not just for one. He's for all nations that

256
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.200
that's Justice to God is that all nations

257
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.400
would be included in this and so he's coming to

258
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.800
bring hope as the Savior Messiah to

259
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.300
All Nations.

260
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.100
Which by the way that's why we have stars everywhere around here right

261
00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.500
this season.

262
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.400
So why the the decoration will work on tonight is stars is

263
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.200
because back in Genesis 12 God promised to

264
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.500
Abraham that his descendants would be more numerous than the

265
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.200
stars in the sky.

266
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.200
Remember kids that's where Abraham gets told by God to walk

267
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.700
outside and try to count the Stars.

268
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.100
Go home and do that tonight, right? I'm gonna go outside. I'm gonna count

269
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.400
the stars in the sky you can't

270
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.600
And God said Abraham, that's how many descendants you're

271
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.400
going to have now. That's that's a lot.

272
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.700
And the symbol is that God is going to open this Covenant

273
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.100
of Salvation up to the Nations and

274
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.100
it will be countless how many people God will

275
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.500
be able to save through that that's why we

276
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.400
have stars here because what we see in Jesus the

277
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.600
Messiah is the Fulfillment.

278
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.100
As he has come to be the one to bring

279
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.500
about that salvation.

280
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.300
And so these Saints of old.

281
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.900
Could look back.

282
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.900
At God's fulfillment of his promises in Exodus especially

283
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.600
and they could have hope as they waited on

284
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.300
God for him to deliver them again.

285
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.900
That was why they kept repeating it throughout the Old Testament Exodus Exodus

286
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.000
Exodus. Remember that remember that don't forget that don't forget

287
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.700
that because that gave them encouragement and hope today.

288
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.300
That God had defeated their most powerful

289
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.000
enemy before.

290
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.600
Egypt

291
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.500
so he could do it again, right?

292
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.200
He would do it again.

293
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.300
But listen, that's the same kind of hope we today Church.

294
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.600
That we gentiles.

295
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:33.800
can have

296
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.200
like they look back and said God defeated Egypt. What do

297
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.500
we have to fear today? We can look today that we what

298
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.900
similar to God doing that in Exodus. We were

299
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.600
born in slave to our most powerful enemy

300
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.200
sin and we were enslaved to

301
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.300
its process. It's it's end it's never

302
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.500
ending penalty, which is death what that was where we were

303
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.900
that we are in our own sin.

304
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.300
And yet God defeated our most powerful enemy.

305
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.600
How did he do that? He did that through his life death and

306
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.600
Resurrection. His cross has empty tomb are symbols that

307
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.800
he defeated death and when he opened the tomb that

308
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.400
opened the door of hope for us.

309
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.500
It's what first Peter 1:3 says that according to God's Great

310
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.300
Mercy. He's caused us to be born again to a Living

311
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:24.700
Hope.

312
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.300
Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead that hope we

313
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.400
have makes us new it's alive. It's something

314
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.800
that should give us a sense of expectation that

315
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.000
the core has been pulled and one day he's coming back.

316
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.400
So just like the Old Testament Saints placed their hope not

317
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.000
in their circumstances they placed their hope in a person.

318
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.300
It's the same for us. Our hope is in Jesus the Overcomer of

319
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.200
death our greatest enemy sin and death the

320
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.500
overcomeer of that Jesus Christ. That's what his first Advent

321
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:57.800
does.

322
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.800
When we look at Christmas, that's what he came to do. What

323
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.300
his first appearance does it provides for us

324
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.200
strength for today. Hope for tomorrow because of

325
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.000
what his overcoming work did for us.

326
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.000
But again, we said this the whole time.

327
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.200
Not only are we hoping in his first Advent there's a sense

328
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.100
where we're still waiting for the Fulfillment of

329
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.700
these things as well. These this full fulfillment

330
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.900
of Hope because because we know this is not complete

331
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.200
yet.

332
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.400
Well that of course is coming someday in the future at that second

333
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.900
Advent his second appearing his second coming.

334
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.700
Where he will remove us from the very presence of sin.

335
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.100
That's that's a beautiful sense of hope that we can

336
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.500
have.

337
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.200
That is coming someday, but listen

338
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.100
church, that is how we as Christians can have hope today.

339
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.700
That all of that is how we can have hope today.

340
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.200
We're talking about this earlier this week

341
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.300
and I love last week. Actually, I talked to it with Phil about this and

342
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.200
he was give this great illustration. I got to give him credit for it. So

343
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.000
this is yours Phil.

344
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.500
It's like whenever you you record the the game

345
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.900
the big game, let's say football game.

346
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.100
You record the game and you've gone to something. You got a wedding or you've

347
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.200
got something else that you've got to go to and you can't watch it at all. But you record it

348
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.200
and you're trying to go full radio silence on this thing to make

349
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.200
sure you don't hear who wins. So you go back and watch it like it's live, right?

350
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.300
Skip the commercials which is better right you want to do it. That way

351
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.600
you go full radio silence to try to keep this but somebody

352
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.700
spills the beans.

353
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.300
Frustrating that is that you now know the final score and you know your team

354
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:36.500
won.

355
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.100
And it's kind of exciting but it's also kind of disappointing because you wanted to watch it

356
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.400
that way, but but think about this.

357
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.500
Think about how you go home and now watch that game a little bit differently,

358
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:46.900
don't you?

359
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.900
Like, you know the outcome already.

360
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.300
You know the end score, you know, your team

361
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.600
wins, you know all of it. Think about how you watch it. The fumbles

362
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.500
don't matter as much anymore.

363
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.600
Right the penalty that ref missed clearly

364
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.700
the holding right you miss that one.

365
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.200
Yeah.

366
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.200
What about when the the team at the like late in the

367
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.400
fourth quarter, they throw a pick six and the team runs it back and and

368
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.300
the other team gets ahead and you're like, oh man. Yeah, that's bad. But

369
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.000
it's not that big a deal right you watch the game very differently.

370
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.300
Why because you know the end result already.

371
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.600
You know that your team wins.

372
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.300
And so that's the idea we get here the same way when our lives now

373
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.000
what if since we know the end of

374
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.300
the story what if our hope is higher than the headlines?

375
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.600
What if our hope is going beyond anything that's happening right

376
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.200
now in the world happening on CNN or Fox News

377
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.300
or whatever you watch like it's it's above that the hope is way up

378
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.000
here not conditional here.

379
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.800
What if we have a hope that we can cling to while the nation's rage

380
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.200
around us? We have hope.

381
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.600
What if we had hope in the Lord like Psalm 130 describes

382
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.300
for with the Lord there is steadfast love

383
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.700
and with him. There is plentiful Redemption.

384
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.400
See the only way

385
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.800
That we can have genuine hope in the face of Earthly circumstances

386
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.400
is to put our hope

387
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.200
in something that is out of the reach of

388
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.000
our surroundings.

389
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.200
you know like if you

390
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.700
so so kids.

391
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.300
If Mom puts the cookies on the counter, you

392
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.100
can reach those, right?

393
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.400
But if if she puts the cookies above the cabinet.

394
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.200
You can't get there.

395
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.300
So the same thing if we're putting our hope in something that's on the cabinet

396
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:42.800
level here.

397
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.200
The enemy can come snatch that away really fast. He can

398
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.300
take it away from any angle all this and we can't put our hope

399
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.300
there if we put our hope in something that's Out Of Reach of our circumstances then

400
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.200
that's secure.

401
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.800
That's what we're talking about with this Advent idea.

402
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.900
That's what Advent does.

403
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.700
Is it reminds us to put our hope in God alone?

404
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.300
To put our hope above our surroundings as

405
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.400
we celebrate what he has done in his first Advent and

406
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.000
all the work he did in his life. But we also anticipate what

407
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.600
he will do someday in his second Advent.

408
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.000
We look forward by Looking Backward.

409
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.100
We look forward by Looking Backward. We're trusting the character of

410
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.100
God that our eternity is secure because what he's done for us.

411
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.000
That's biblical hope and it's what we celebrate at Christmas.

412
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.800
at this God Has Come In the Flesh once

413
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.800
and he's coming back again. Someday In the Flesh just like

414
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.100
he did and so we wait with hope.

415
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.800
See, that's the candle that we are going to light tonight.

416
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.400
The first candle of advent is hope the

417
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400
candle of Hope.

418
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.300
And so as we go through the process of the next few weeks

419
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.200
of lighting all of these you're going to hear those words, you're going to talk about each of

420
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.400
those words separately. But tonight. The first one is hope

421
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.700
I'm invite the the wheat family up here tonight to help lead

422
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.100
us through this tonight as we as

423
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.500
we celebrate the beginning of Advent and

424
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.400
Jay and Brady and Wendy Also Serve Faithfully in

425
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.200
many ways in our kids ministry and their family is

426
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.200
going to light the candle as they read scripture and

427
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.800
pray for us as we continue to worship

428
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.100
tonight.

429
00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.900
Isaiah 11:1 through 10 there shall

430
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.500
come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse and

431
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.200
a branch from his roots shell bear fruit and the

432
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.500
spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and

433
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.600
understanding the spirit of counsel and might the

434
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.800
spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord and his Delight

435
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.300
shall be in the fear of the Lord. He shall not judge by

436
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.900
what he's by what his eyes see or decide despite

437
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.600
what his ears hear but with righteousness

438
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.600
he shall judge the poor and decide with equity for

439
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.200
the meek of the earth and he shall strike the Earth

440
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.400
with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips. He

441
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.000
shall kill the wicked righteousness shall be the

442
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.800
belt of his waste and faithfulness the belt of his loins the

443
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.200
wolf shall dwell with the lamb and the

444
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.600
leopard shall lie down with the young goat in the calf

445
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.300
and The Lion and the fat and calf together and the

446
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.100
little child shall lead them the cow and the bear

447
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.900
shall Grace their young shall lie down together and the

448
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.900
lion shall eat straw like the ox

449
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.200
The nursing child shall play over the whole of the

450
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.700
Cobra and the weaned child shall put his hand at

451
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.700
the adder's Den. They shall not hurt or destroy

452
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.200
in all the Holy Mountain.

453
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.200
For the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the

454
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.200
waters cover the sea in that day the root

455
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.700
of Jesse who shall stand as a signal for his peoples of

456
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.800
him. Shall the nations in choir and has resting place

457
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.000
shall be glorious.

458
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.300
Let's pray.

459
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.500
God thank you for giving us the ability to

460
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.400
come together and worship and celebrate you in this

461
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:26.500
season.

462
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.200
Thank you for sending your Messiah.

463
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.300
To rescue us from sin and death and Conquer it.

464
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.800
Thank you for the hope of yours. Your son's

465
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:38.900
return.

466
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.200
Thank you for the hope that we will rejoice with

467
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.800
you. I pray that you would just soften soften our

468
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.400
hearts. Give us peace during this season

469
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.900
allow us to be the vessel.

470
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.300
This shines your light so that others can see your glory.

471
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.800
Also understand that the reason we we

472
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.700
even have this season is because of you.

473
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.400
amen
