1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.490
From there.

2
00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:03.725
Today we're continuing our summer sermon series

3
00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:05.125
through Romans 12,

4
00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.365
and we're examining what a transformed life in Christ really

5
00:00:09.365 --> 00:00:13.565
looks like as we realign ourselves as best we can, but,

6
00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:18.125
but by the Holy Spirit to the standard of Jesus, the perfect

7
00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:20.005
vertical of Jesus.

8
00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:24.565
As we get into it today, I want to tell you, uh,

9
00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:26.405
about a story of a, a woman.

10
00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.605
You might know her name, Rosaria Butterfield.

11
00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:30.725
Now she has a powerful story.

12
00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.725
She recorded it in a book called The Secret Thoughts

13
00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:35.245
of An Unlikely Convert.

14
00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:40.525
Now, her story is powerful

15
00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:42.965
because for part of her life she was a professor

16
00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:44.405
of women's studies

17
00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:46.685
and she was living a same-sex lifestyle,

18
00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.285
even hating Christians

19
00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:51.285
and working against them in, in many active ways,

20
00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.405
writing articles and books about it.

21
00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:57.985
And that was her life until till the pastor

22
00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:01.945
of a small church and his wife befriended Rosaria,

23
00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:05.465
invited her over for meals and,

24
00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:09.345
and had practical needs met in her life and prayed for her.

25
00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:10.985
And they built a relationship with her.

26
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:14.185
And over time it built this deep connection.

27
00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:15.985
And she says that they never pushed her.

28
00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:17.625
Uh, they just loved her.

29
00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:20.265
They cared for her, answered questions if they could,

30
00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:23.225
but really just was caring for her as a person.

31
00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:28.065
And a few years later, uh, one day as she was happening

32
00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:30.145
to be at the church, he was preaching a sermon.

33
00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:32.105
And, and in that moment, God opened her heart

34
00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:36.145
to believe the gospel to be changed

35
00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:37.505
by the gospel completely.

36
00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:39.865
Her life is totally different now.

37
00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.825
It's a powerful picture of what God can do

38
00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:44.305
and she attributes that first

39
00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:46.025
and foremost to the Lord and what he did.

40
00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:50.585
But she also mentions the radically ordinary hospitality

41
00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:53.305
of that pastor and his wife.

42
00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:59.665
They were Christians who sought out this woman

43
00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:01.825
who was opposed to God, who,

44
00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:04.145
who many Christians would have nothing to do with,

45
00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:05.345
wanted to avoid her.

46
00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:09.185
They sought her out and they invited her into their lives.

47
00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:14.625
Well, that's the command we're going

48
00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:17.345
to see in Romans 1213 today.

49
00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:20.945
Seek to show hospitality.

50
00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:26.035
Seek to show hospitality.

51
00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:29.285
And here's why this is so important

52
00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:33.045
because I think most of us misunderstand

53
00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:37.085
what hospitality really is when we hear

54
00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:38.365
that word hospitality, most

55
00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:40.845
of us assume it's all about having a big house or

56
00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.165
or being able to host a lot of parties

57
00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:44.685
and entertain people at your house.

58
00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:46.125
And and that's hospitality.

59
00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:48.165
Emily, when we were at seminary

60
00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:50.445
and my wife, she heard from a woman that

61
00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:53.205
to be hospitable you have to iron the bedsheets

62
00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:54.325
that you put on people's beds.

63
00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:01.085
Like if that's where we're going with hospitality

64
00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:03.485
or big house, like we're all outta that one, right?

65
00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:06.165
There's there's no way we could do that.

66
00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.565
And some of us, like I don't even have a house.

67
00:03:07.635 --> 00:03:10.805
Okay, well, here, that's why I'm glad for

68
00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:13.285
what the Bible says about this topic

69
00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:16.955
because it has nothing to do

70
00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:19.035
with whether you even have a house.

71
00:03:20.865 --> 00:03:24.795
It's about your heart. It's about what is in here.

72
00:03:24.895 --> 00:03:27.875
And here's what we need, this, this reorientation

73
00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:29.795
around this idea of hospitality

74
00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:31.755
because I believe the very mission

75
00:03:31.755 --> 00:03:33.875
of God flows directly through this concept.

76
00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:38.555
This is how he's gonna reach the world first and foremost.

77
00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:42.155
And so since it's that big a deal, we need to ask God

78
00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:43.675
for help as we go into this.

79
00:03:43.705 --> 00:03:47.355
Lord, we pray as, as we look at this topic, it's heavy.

80
00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:50.715
Uh, there's a challenge here that we'll all feel.

81
00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:53.475
And so, Lord, I pray your spirit would remove obstacles,

82
00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:56.395
get, get things out of our way, in our minds

83
00:03:56.395 --> 00:03:59.115
that we would be able to hear and receive and understand.

84
00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:00.915
And as James says, obey

85
00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:03.635
what you've called us to in your word.

86
00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:05.755
But it's gotta be your work.

87
00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:10.435
Lord, change us if we need it today. In Jesus' name. Amen.

88
00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:13.395
So here's how we're gonna go about this today.

89
00:04:14.315 --> 00:04:17.555
I wanna teach the actual language of the phrase

90
00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:19.155
that we're studying in Romans 1213.

91
00:04:19.185 --> 00:04:21.995
Just simply look at the meaning of the language

92
00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:24.675
and then we're gonna hang four lessons off of it

93
00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:26.435
as we seek to apply it.

94
00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:29.395
And so we're gonna start in, in Romans 1213, just

95
00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:33.835
that first word, seek When we dig into

96
00:04:33.835 --> 00:04:35.035
that word in the original language,

97
00:04:35.035 --> 00:04:36.875
that word is deko in the Greek.

98
00:04:36.935 --> 00:04:40.555
And it means to pursue or to chase after

99
00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:43.875
or to eagerly pursue chase.

100
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:47.395
Uh, follow something eagerly with energy

101
00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:48.715
and pursuit

102
00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:52.155
that in a sense you're intensely hunting something

103
00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:56.955
you're seeking for opportunities to do that thing.

104
00:04:57.065 --> 00:04:59.875
It's actually, we use that language like we,

105
00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:03.955
because it's actually the same word used for persecution

106
00:05:05.095 --> 00:05:06.235
in Matthew five 10.

107
00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:10.475
Jesus said, blessed are those who are persecuted.

108
00:05:10.475 --> 00:05:14.195
That's the same word. Dko for righteousness sake

109
00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:16.435
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

110
00:05:18.095 --> 00:05:22.395
And so the same word for seek in our verse is

111
00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:24.595
persecution over here.

112
00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:29.155
So think about how persecutor will pursue Christians

113
00:05:29.255 --> 00:05:30.315
to mistreat them, right?

114
00:05:30.315 --> 00:05:31.635
Like they have to go intentionally

115
00:05:31.635 --> 00:05:34.955
after it to find the people to do what they're going to do.

116
00:05:36.855 --> 00:05:37.915
So that's the first word. But

117
00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:40.595
that last word hospitality is really interesting.

118
00:05:41.755 --> 00:05:44.195
'cause basically in Greek they took two different words

119
00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:45.995
and they mashed it into one word.

120
00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:49.835
And so you'll see it on the screen. It's the word philia.

121
00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:52.915
And so again, means nothing to most, but

122
00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:54.955
but it's actually two words, Philo

123
00:05:55.335 --> 00:05:57.925
and xenia put together as one word.

124
00:05:57.945 --> 00:06:00.885
Now you might have heard a little bit about that first one,

125
00:06:01.135 --> 00:06:03.685
Philo, it's the word we use for brotherly love.

126
00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:07.445
Like the, the city of Philadelphia is the city of

127
00:06:08.515 --> 00:06:09.565
brotherly love, right?

128
00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:14.045
So Phila is philo, which means brotherly love. So love.

129
00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:19.445
But that second part of it, Xenia means stranger.

130
00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:23.695
It's where we get our word xenophobia from.

131
00:06:25.225 --> 00:06:27.335
Xenophobia is the prejudice against

132
00:06:27.435 --> 00:06:30.735
or fear of someone who is from a different nation

133
00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:32.775
or a different tribe or a different group

134
00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:36.335
and you're afraid of or going to stay away from.

135
00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:38.735
That's xenophobia. It's this word.

136
00:06:38.735 --> 00:06:41.815
It's those people we call aliens or strangers.

137
00:06:42.075 --> 00:06:44.775
That's the idea coming across with this word.

138
00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:48.415
And so as we see it, let's be very clear about this

139
00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:51.465
'cause that word hospitality is the whole point of this.

140
00:06:52.365 --> 00:06:54.105
Phileo, let's be very clear

141
00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:57.425
that word hospitality in English in the original language

142
00:06:57.615 --> 00:07:01.785
literally means love of strangers,

143
00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:08.045
hospitality in the text, love of strangers.

144
00:07:08.045 --> 00:07:10.445
Does that do a little bit different than maybe

145
00:07:10.445 --> 00:07:12.765
what you walked in here with thinking hospitality.

146
00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:18.975
So what that applies like is

147
00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:22.375
that hospitality is not just hanging out with your buddies.

148
00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:28.015
It, it's not merely hosting a party for your kids',

149
00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:29.535
classmates that you already know all of them.

150
00:07:30.915 --> 00:07:32.415
That's not hospitality.

151
00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:35.935
Hospitality is love of strangers.

152
00:07:39.785 --> 00:07:40.885
So that's what this means.

153
00:07:43.035 --> 00:07:45.245
Well, now let's, let's take four lessons

154
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.325
and hang it off that foundation.

155
00:07:47.605 --> 00:07:48.965
'cause we're gonna grow in the desires

156
00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:50.045
to grow in obedience to this, right?

157
00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:52.325
Applying this command. So here's some things we

158
00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:53.485
need to remember.

159
00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:56.565
Four things we need to remember based on what it means

160
00:07:57.545 --> 00:07:58.765
as we seek to apply it.

161
00:07:58.765 --> 00:08:01.325
Here's the first one. This means

162
00:08:01.325 --> 00:08:05.245
that biblical hospitality is a pursuit, not a preference.

163
00:08:08.475 --> 00:08:13.445
Christian hospitality is a pursuit, not a preference.

164
00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:18.545
Remember that first word, seek it's dko.

165
00:08:18.545 --> 00:08:20.545
It means to pursue, to chase

166
00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:23.105
after, to follow eagerly

167
00:08:24.355 --> 00:08:26.225
again in a similar way to

168
00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:28.105
how people would persecute the early church.

169
00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:31.225
And so we take that word, we flip it around.

170
00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:35.265
And in Romans 12, 13 means we are to hunt

171
00:08:35.685 --> 00:08:40.305
for opportunities to welcome strangers in the same

172
00:08:40.845 --> 00:08:44.465
energy and intensity that people would persecute Christians.

173
00:08:46.555 --> 00:08:49.435
I think Saul, right in Acts, he would, he would go

174
00:08:49.485 --> 00:08:50.795
after Christians.

175
00:08:51.175 --> 00:08:54.155
He was finding seek, seeking them, hunting them.

176
00:08:54.455 --> 00:08:58.885
That's how we should be in our way of welcoming strangers.

177
00:09:01.255 --> 00:09:02.635
It means hospitality is not passive.

178
00:09:04.105 --> 00:09:05.355
It's not just sitting back and waiting

179
00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:06.755
for the opportunities to come your way.

180
00:09:06.815 --> 00:09:11.705
You're hunting, looking, seeking. It's also not optional.

181
00:09:12.975 --> 00:09:15.345
This is a command, right?

182
00:09:15.615 --> 00:09:17.825
It's not just that you have the, the right personality

183
00:09:18.045 --> 00:09:21.385
or the right circumstances or comfort level with strangers.

184
00:09:21.385 --> 00:09:24.145
No, this is a command for all of us to pursue.

185
00:09:24.175 --> 00:09:27.305
It's a, it's a qualification for us as elders.

186
00:09:27.365 --> 00:09:28.705
That's part of the qualifications.

187
00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:30.145
But this is a command for all of us.

188
00:09:30.145 --> 00:09:31.425
Some of us have the gift of it,

189
00:09:31.485 --> 00:09:33.225
but this is a command for all of us.

190
00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:39.355
It's not optional. It's an intentional pursuit

191
00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:42.115
that we are seeking to show hospitality.

192
00:09:42.175 --> 00:09:43.995
And that means even if it's dangerous.

193
00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:48.365
'cause remember when Paul was writing this in Romans 12,

194
00:09:49.545 --> 00:09:51.265
hospitality would have been dangerous.

195
00:09:52.695 --> 00:09:55.225
That stranger they were welcoming could have been a criminal

196
00:09:55.225 --> 00:09:57.425
for all they knew could have been carrying some

197
00:09:57.425 --> 00:09:58.705
disease that they didn't know about.

198
00:09:58.925 --> 00:10:00.105
It could have been somebody

199
00:10:00.105 --> 00:10:03.345
that was bringing this burden on their limited resources

200
00:10:03.365 --> 00:10:04.865
and it was gonna cost them something.

201
00:10:05.045 --> 00:10:07.545
It was dangerous. Like the Good Samaritan parable.

202
00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:10.425
This man pays for him for a year to to live

203
00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.545
and be taken care of.

204
00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:13.585
Like it's a burden on him to do that.

205
00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:15.545
But he said, I'm hospitable.

206
00:10:15.845 --> 00:10:19.505
Yet as dangerous as it might be, as costly as it might be,

207
00:10:19.715 --> 00:10:22.865
God's word still commands this of us.

208
00:10:23.085 --> 00:10:26.745
The active pursuit of opportunities to welcome others.

209
00:10:30.265 --> 00:10:32.685
And so it's a pursuit, not a preference. And you know why?

210
00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:35.765
Why is this so important? Why should we do this?

211
00:10:35.795 --> 00:10:37.405
Because God pursued us.

212
00:10:40.115 --> 00:10:43.895
We pursue hospitality because God pursued us.

213
00:10:46.535 --> 00:10:49.825
This is so important and it's all over the Bible.

214
00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:54.705
Like God built this into the fabric of redemption.

215
00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:58.305
It's all over the Bible. God pursued us.

216
00:10:59.045 --> 00:11:02.385
It starts all the way back in Israel in the Old Testament

217
00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:04.385
as they were coming out of Egypt.

218
00:11:05.055 --> 00:11:08.905
Leviticus 1933 and 34 says, when a stranger, this is God.

219
00:11:09.055 --> 00:11:11.825
When a stranger sojourns with you in your land,

220
00:11:12.165 --> 00:11:13.505
you shall do him no wrong.

221
00:11:14.645 --> 00:11:17.145
You should treat the stranger who sojourns with you

222
00:11:17.205 --> 00:11:18.625
as the native among you.

223
00:11:19.005 --> 00:11:21.345
And you shall love him as yourself.

224
00:11:21.725 --> 00:11:24.305
For you were strangers in the land of Egypt,

225
00:11:25.265 --> 00:11:26.665
I am the Lord your God.

226
00:11:27.985 --> 00:11:29.285
Did you notice his motivation?

227
00:11:30.745 --> 00:11:35.005
God says, do this first because I'm the Lord and

228
00:11:35.005 --> 00:11:38.045
because as I'm the Lord I brought you out.

229
00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:40.925
You, you once were strangers in Egypt, but now you're not.

230
00:11:42.025 --> 00:11:44.285
And so because you're not now, you can care

231
00:11:44.285 --> 00:11:45.525
for those who are strangers.

232
00:11:45.525 --> 00:11:48.445
You can love them like I loved you, I pursued you in Egypt.

233
00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:51.525
You can pursue others in your land.

234
00:11:53.535 --> 00:11:54.955
It is in the Old Testament. It's in the

235
00:11:54.955 --> 00:11:56.275
New Testament as well.

236
00:11:56.305 --> 00:11:57.995
This is Ephesians chapter two.

237
00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:02.195
Verse 12 tells us to remember that you were at

238
00:12:02.195 --> 00:12:05.275
that time separated from Christ, alienated

239
00:12:05.785 --> 00:12:10.035
from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants

240
00:12:10.055 --> 00:12:14.555
of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.

241
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:18.635
Yet what did God do?

242
00:12:20.415 --> 00:12:24.515
He welcomed us in as strangers into his family.

243
00:12:24.805 --> 00:12:27.715
Verse 13. But now in Christ Jesus, you

244
00:12:27.715 --> 00:12:31.275
who are once far off have been brought near by the blood

245
00:12:31.275 --> 00:12:35.205
of Christ, like strangers

246
00:12:35.205 --> 00:12:38.365
before now, not strangers actually in the family.

247
00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:41.965
Verse 19. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens.

248
00:12:42.145 --> 00:12:44.005
You are fellow citizens with the saints

249
00:12:44.065 --> 00:12:46.685
and members of the household of God.

250
00:12:46.905 --> 00:12:51.445
God built hospitality into the very fabric of the gospel.

251
00:12:53.645 --> 00:12:55.525
'cause think about how he showed hospitality, right?

252
00:12:55.815 --> 00:12:59.645
Jesus left the comforts of heaven

253
00:13:01.055 --> 00:13:05.615
of his home to pursue strangers

254
00:13:05.615 --> 00:13:06.975
and rebels like you and me.

255
00:13:08.425 --> 00:13:10.915
He Made himself uncomfortable.

256
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:14.435
He ate with tax collectors and sinners.

257
00:13:14.435 --> 00:13:17.035
Those who are considered outsiders. He went after them.

258
00:13:17.415 --> 00:13:20.875
And then as he's doing that, he's now prepared a place

259
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.795
for us who were once strangers to now live

260
00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:25.315
with him in his home forever.

261
00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:30.565
That's hospitality, isn't it? Like God set the pace.

262
00:13:30.745 --> 00:13:35.365
God set the pattern for us in his very redemption

263
00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:38.685
of us that we can pursue in our mission.

264
00:13:40.135 --> 00:13:43.785
Because think about it. When we truly grasp the reality

265
00:13:43.785 --> 00:13:48.635
that God has welcomed us into his household, that

266
00:13:48.635 --> 00:13:52.155
that God has made us co-heirs with Christ,

267
00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:56.705
that he's built this eternal home for us.

268
00:13:58.175 --> 00:14:00.785
Like when we grasp it, how can we not turn around

269
00:14:00.805 --> 00:14:02.545
and eagerly welcome other

270
00:14:02.545 --> 00:14:07.225
people again?

271
00:14:07.225 --> 00:14:09.945
Because God pursued us first.

272
00:14:11.785 --> 00:14:13.685
We can go pursue others.

273
00:14:16.695 --> 00:14:17.875
Here's the thing though about this.

274
00:14:19.865 --> 00:14:21.355
Many of us don't do this, right?

275
00:14:24.945 --> 00:14:28.565
We don't pursue the stranger we, we avoid, we run away from.

276
00:14:31.775 --> 00:14:35.195
So why don't we do this? It's clear, it's commanded.

277
00:14:35.195 --> 00:14:37.235
It's in the fabric of the gospel. Why don't we do this?

278
00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:40.195
Well, it's, it's the same reason we don't obey God

279
00:14:40.195 --> 00:14:41.315
in all kinds of other ways.

280
00:14:42.805 --> 00:14:44.575
It's because of idolatry in our hearts.

281
00:14:46.415 --> 00:14:50.065
Because something has taken priority over what God said

282
00:14:50.065 --> 00:14:51.065
to do in.

283
00:14:51.815 --> 00:14:53.955
And we follow that instead of following the Lord.

284
00:14:56.355 --> 00:14:58.335
And so I want to just identify,

285
00:14:58.365 --> 00:14:59.695
there's probably way more than this,

286
00:14:59.695 --> 00:15:03.615
but I wanna just identify three, three obstacles

287
00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:07.695
that will will keep us from following this command.

288
00:15:08.085 --> 00:15:12.775
Like three idols that that we will have to have to overcome,

289
00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.415
like these obstacles, these hurdles in our way.

290
00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:18.375
We're gonna have to overcome that in order to obey

291
00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:19.575
what God has said to do here.

292
00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:22.295
There's things in our hearts keeping us from doing this.

293
00:15:22.365 --> 00:15:23.615
What are a few of those?

294
00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:31.675
Well here's, here's the first one. It's the idol of comfort.

295
00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:36.155
Man. We just love our rest.

296
00:15:37.255 --> 00:15:40.715
We love our routines, we love our preferences.

297
00:15:43.435 --> 00:15:46.975
So we don't seek to show hospitality. You know what?

298
00:15:46.975 --> 00:15:48.815
Because it's disruptive to our plans.

299
00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:50.375
This is what I wanted do with my afternoon.

300
00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:52.415
This is what I wanted to do with my evening man.

301
00:15:52.415 --> 00:15:54.615
It's been a long week. I don't wanna do anything on

302
00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:56.015
that Friday night to go minister those.

303
00:15:56.075 --> 00:15:58.135
Ah, no I don't. I want to take my time.

304
00:15:58.325 --> 00:16:00.055
This is my time, my rest.

305
00:16:00.395 --> 00:16:02.375
That's the idol of comfort

306
00:16:03.365 --> 00:16:07.935
because hospitality is inherently disruptive to our plants.

307
00:16:09.155 --> 00:16:12.835
It Will force you to be outside of what you wanna do

308
00:16:12.985 --> 00:16:15.715
because it is not natural.

309
00:16:16.895 --> 00:16:17.915
But just think about that.

310
00:16:20.165 --> 00:16:24.835
God's love for us disrupted heaven itself.

311
00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:28.595
It didn't, it needed nothing.

312
00:16:30.205 --> 00:16:32.335
They could have, God could have kept it that way,

313
00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:36.755
but no took on flesh to come to us,

314
00:16:37.025 --> 00:16:39.635
make himself uncomfortable to pursue us.

315
00:16:39.935 --> 00:16:42.995
He disrupted his comfort to come to us.

316
00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:46.985
That's hospitality. The idol

317
00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:50.185
of comfort will keep us from pursuing this.

318
00:16:52.765 --> 00:16:54.495
There's also the idol of control

319
00:16:56.325 --> 00:16:58.295
that keeps us from pursuing welcome

320
00:17:00.815 --> 00:17:03.575
'cause strangers bring unpredictability.

321
00:17:05.585 --> 00:17:07.635
Like you never know outcomes

322
00:17:08.175 --> 00:17:10.715
or conversations, how things are gonna go.

323
00:17:10.715 --> 00:17:11.875
Maybe there's something's gonna happen,

324
00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:13.035
maybe something's gonna be said.

325
00:17:13.255 --> 00:17:16.435
You can't control that. So yes, it's unpredictable.

326
00:17:16.455 --> 00:17:18.995
It won't always turn out the way we hope it will.

327
00:17:19.065 --> 00:17:22.195
There's an element of risk involved in hospitality.

328
00:17:23.975 --> 00:17:26.555
And so what do we do? We want to control safety.

329
00:17:26.735 --> 00:17:29.235
We want to control everything working out.

330
00:17:29.235 --> 00:17:31.555
And so we just don't get in the mess.

331
00:17:35.635 --> 00:17:39.255
But, but one of the fundamental theological principles in

332
00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:42.375
our faith is that we believe in a sovereign God.

333
00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:48.725
And so don't we think that if we obey what he has said

334
00:17:48.785 --> 00:17:52.565
to do, that we can trust him with the results

335
00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:53.765
of what he's told us to do.

336
00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:56.415
Like God, this is a risk.

337
00:17:56.515 --> 00:17:58.815
God, this looks a little costly, God this, he's like,

338
00:17:58.855 --> 00:18:00.095
I know I told you to do it

339
00:18:00.095 --> 00:18:02.295
and I'm gonna work it all out for your good.

340
00:18:03.825 --> 00:18:05.115
Even if it doesn't look like we

341
00:18:05.115 --> 00:18:06.155
think it should or want it to.

342
00:18:06.935 --> 00:18:10.955
The idol of control keeps us from hospitality.

343
00:18:13.695 --> 00:18:15.945
Then there's the idol of appearances.

344
00:18:18.635 --> 00:18:20.365
Like we fear that our home might be

345
00:18:20.425 --> 00:18:21.485
not, it's not good enough.

346
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:24.365
I don't have enough money to do that or,

347
00:18:24.465 --> 00:18:26.285
or maybe people aren't really gonna need what I have

348
00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:27.885
to offer or whatever it is.

349
00:18:27.945 --> 00:18:29.805
And you think this is the way things look.

350
00:18:30.035 --> 00:18:31.925
Certainly it won't look right or

351
00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:34.565
or possibly even worse, this one, this one's probably worse.

352
00:18:37.665 --> 00:18:40.485
We fear what people are going to think

353
00:18:43.485 --> 00:18:45.535
when those people come over to our house

354
00:18:47.685 --> 00:18:49.855
When We're seen at a restaurant having a meal

355
00:18:49.855 --> 00:18:51.135
with them.

356
00:18:55.725 --> 00:18:59.105
You know, Jesus faced the same kind of idea.

357
00:19:01.445 --> 00:19:04.055
This is Luke 5 29 through 31.

358
00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:06.735
Levi made Jesus a great feast in his house.

359
00:19:07.145 --> 00:19:09.215
There was a large company of tax collectors

360
00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.135
and others reclining at table with them.

361
00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:12.975
And the Pharisees

362
00:19:13.035 --> 00:19:16.935
and their scribes grumbled at his disciples

363
00:19:18.665 --> 00:19:19.845
saying, why do you eat

364
00:19:19.845 --> 00:19:21.725
and drink with tax collectors and sinners?

365
00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:24.015
And Jesus answered them.

366
00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:26.095
Those who are well have no need

367
00:19:26.115 --> 00:19:28.735
of a physician, but those who are sick.

368
00:19:33.425 --> 00:19:35.285
So there might be some religious folks

369
00:19:35.315 --> 00:19:38.885
that grumble a bit about your pursuit of hospitality.

370
00:19:41.905 --> 00:19:45.725
And the enemy will do everything he can

371
00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:48.245
to keep you from doing this.

372
00:19:50.585 --> 00:19:55.405
But don't forget, God welcomed us when we were

373
00:19:55.465 --> 00:19:57.045
at our worst, right?

374
00:19:58.715 --> 00:20:00.455
We didn't clean ourselves up to come to him.

375
00:20:00.515 --> 00:20:02.255
He met us in the middle of the mess.

376
00:20:02.355 --> 00:20:04.495
Why would we not welcome others in the middle of their mess?

377
00:20:05.755 --> 00:20:08.215
And why would we be offended at someone else who's trying

378
00:20:08.215 --> 00:20:09.655
to meet someone in the middle of their mess

379
00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:11.215
because they're doing what God does?

380
00:20:11.475 --> 00:20:16.385
Why are we not? So there's

381
00:20:16.385 --> 00:20:18.945
gonna be obstacles, this idol of comfort, this idol

382
00:20:18.965 --> 00:20:20.745
of control, this idol of appearances.

383
00:20:20.745 --> 00:20:22.385
There's gonna be things in our way.

384
00:20:22.385 --> 00:20:24.465
The enemy tosses these things in our minds,

385
00:20:24.565 --> 00:20:26.185
but God has commanded us to do this.

386
00:20:26.445 --> 00:20:28.825
And God empowers us to do this.

387
00:20:30.575 --> 00:20:31.745
This says it's very heart.

388
00:20:32.015 --> 00:20:35.105
This is in the fabric of the gospel so we can,

389
00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:37.465
and listen, don't think it's gonna be overly hard.

390
00:20:37.575 --> 00:20:39.865
It's gonna be like a masochist. You just love pain.

391
00:20:40.015 --> 00:20:41.785
This is all costly to you.

392
00:20:41.965 --> 00:20:43.865
No, listen, there are great blessings

393
00:20:43.885 --> 00:20:45.225
as we walk in faith like this.

394
00:20:47.035 --> 00:20:50.005
When you step out in faith in this kind of way

395
00:20:50.265 --> 00:20:53.525
to show hospitality, to seek to show like you step into

396
00:20:53.525 --> 00:20:55.925
that man, there are great blessings that come in your life.

397
00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:02.175
Again, think about how we've been realigning our lives all

398
00:21:02.175 --> 00:21:06.335
summer with Jesus's perfect standard with his life.

399
00:21:06.825 --> 00:21:09.895
Jesus was the most hospitable person ever.

400
00:21:11.695 --> 00:21:15.355
And so when we start to show hospitality, we are beginning

401
00:21:15.415 --> 00:21:17.955
to realign ourselves with Christ.

402
00:21:18.045 --> 00:21:20.235
We're conforming to his image.

403
00:21:20.395 --> 00:21:22.235
'cause think about what happens when you show hospitality.

404
00:21:22.455 --> 00:21:26.515
It realigns us by increasing our capacity for love.

405
00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:30.355
I didn't know I could love someone that different than me.

406
00:21:30.475 --> 00:21:32.115
I didn't know I could love someone like that.

407
00:21:32.135 --> 00:21:34.675
It it kills selfishness as you gotta get outside

408
00:21:34.675 --> 00:21:37.755
of your comfort and it starts to rip out those things

409
00:21:37.945 --> 00:21:39.915
that you've held back for too long.

410
00:21:39.975 --> 00:21:42.195
It cultivates sacrifice in your life.

411
00:21:42.365 --> 00:21:45.595
Think is that not Christ-like love,

412
00:21:46.825 --> 00:21:48.835
unselfish sacrifice

413
00:21:49.345 --> 00:21:53.675
that is more Christ-like As you are forced to do that

414
00:21:54.255 --> 00:21:57.475
in showing hospitality, it grows your heart.

415
00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:02.785
So he grows you into Christ's image. That's a blessing.

416
00:22:03.005 --> 00:22:06.985
But it also means God's presence is in a unique way there

417
00:22:07.165 --> 00:22:08.585
as you practice hospitality.

418
00:22:11.265 --> 00:22:12.765
So there's an interesting teaching Jesus

419
00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:15.765
gives in Matthew 25.

420
00:22:15.795 --> 00:22:16.965
He's talking about the final judgment

421
00:22:17.225 --> 00:22:21.365
and he's talking of characteristics of true Christians.

422
00:22:22.145 --> 00:22:23.605
And he uses sheep and goats

423
00:22:23.605 --> 00:22:26.965
and he says sheep, the true believers are doing things

424
00:22:27.155 --> 00:22:31.045
that the goats aren't doing with the right heart, at least.

425
00:22:33.095 --> 00:22:36.395
And he, he says it this way, Matthew 25, this is 35 and 36.

426
00:22:37.365 --> 00:22:39.555
Jesus says, for I was hungry, he gave me food.

427
00:22:39.675 --> 00:22:41.115
I was thirsty. You gave me drink.

428
00:22:41.635 --> 00:22:45.035
I was a stranger and you welcomed me. I was naked.

429
00:22:45.135 --> 00:22:47.075
You clothed me. I was sick. You visited me.

430
00:22:47.195 --> 00:22:49.355
I was in prison and you came to me.

431
00:22:50.295 --> 00:22:53.035
Sounds a lot like hospitality, doesn't it?

432
00:22:55.215 --> 00:22:59.515
But, but notice Jesus did something here where like he,

433
00:22:59.515 --> 00:23:01.075
he said, I was this.

434
00:23:01.295 --> 00:23:05.435
You did this to me. That they were in a sense doing it

435
00:23:05.715 --> 00:23:07.435
actually to Jesus, which was confusing to them.

436
00:23:07.755 --> 00:23:08.955
'cause they were like, Jesus, when did we,

437
00:23:09.135 --> 00:23:12.115
and so that's what he, they say next verses 37 through 39,

438
00:23:12.335 --> 00:23:13.675
the righteous will answer him saying, Lord,

439
00:23:13.675 --> 00:23:16.435
when did we see you hungry and feed you?

440
00:23:17.225 --> 00:23:18.835
When did we see you thirsty, give you a drink?

441
00:23:18.835 --> 00:23:20.875
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you

442
00:23:21.375 --> 00:23:22.435
or naked and clothe you?

443
00:23:22.545 --> 00:23:25.035
When did we see you sick or in prison and and visit you?

444
00:23:25.035 --> 00:23:26.795
Jesus, we never saw you do any of those things.

445
00:23:26.855 --> 00:23:31.685
So how did we do it to you? Look what he says. Verse 40.

446
00:23:32.505 --> 00:23:34.045
And the king will answer them truly.

447
00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:37.125
I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these

448
00:23:37.705 --> 00:23:40.445
my brothers, you did it to me.

449
00:23:42.765 --> 00:23:43.765
You did it to me.

450
00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:48.625
I'm there. It's like verse two

451
00:23:48.625 --> 00:23:52.025
of Hebrews 13 says, do not neglect to show hospitality

452
00:23:52.045 --> 00:23:53.905
to strangers for thereby some

453
00:23:53.905 --> 00:23:58.905
of entertained angels unawares

454
00:23:59.355 --> 00:24:01.435
So here's what happens as we pursue hospitality,

455
00:24:01.615 --> 00:24:03.715
we have no idea what God is doing in that moment.

456
00:24:06.285 --> 00:24:07.785
We have no idea what he's doing

457
00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:08.985
behind the scenes in that moment.

458
00:24:09.045 --> 00:24:12.025
But what we do know is he has made that a holy moment

459
00:24:13.255 --> 00:24:17.145
that his presence is there somehow uniquely, he's infusing

460
00:24:17.145 --> 00:24:20.025
that moment to make it a blessing to us

461
00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:23.425
because Psalm 1611 says, in his presence,

462
00:24:23.425 --> 00:24:24.825
there's fullness of joy.

463
00:24:25.245 --> 00:24:28.785
So if God is present as we minister to the stranger,

464
00:24:29.175 --> 00:24:30.545
then we get joy

465
00:24:30.575 --> 00:24:32.145
because we're with his presence

466
00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:33.945
as we minister to the stranger.

467
00:24:35.665 --> 00:24:38.585
What a blessing. And we get joy

468
00:24:39.095 --> 00:24:43.465
from the Lord in the moment as we seek to show hospitality.

469
00:24:44.245 --> 00:24:45.385
And so that's a huge blessing.

470
00:24:45.385 --> 00:24:46.785
But then also, think of this, think

471
00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:50.625
of the friendships you never would've expected you could

472
00:24:50.625 --> 00:24:54.545
ever have with people who are so different than you are.

473
00:24:56.775 --> 00:24:58.175
I just think about the international students

474
00:24:58.175 --> 00:24:59.335
that we have here at our church.

475
00:24:59.335 --> 00:25:01.055
The last few years, that number has just grown

476
00:25:01.115 --> 00:25:02.135
and grown and grown.

477
00:25:02.435 --> 00:25:05.135
And it is unbelievably special to watch

478
00:25:05.435 --> 00:25:08.935
how God has brought people from Africa, Southeast Asia,

479
00:25:09.195 --> 00:25:11.815
the Middle East has brought them to our doorstep.

480
00:25:11.955 --> 00:25:14.295
And we have built relationships with each other

481
00:25:14.515 --> 00:25:16.855
and we have learned so much from them

482
00:25:18.795 --> 00:25:20.405
That I would never would've had the opportunity

483
00:25:20.405 --> 00:25:22.125
to do any other way apart from being

484
00:25:22.245 --> 00:25:23.445
a part of what God's doing.

485
00:25:25.255 --> 00:25:27.425
Just think of the unexpected blessings that come

486
00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:29.825
with friendships from people all over the world

487
00:25:30.365 --> 00:25:31.865
who see things differently than you do,

488
00:25:32.085 --> 00:25:34.425
who can help you understand how to walk

489
00:25:34.425 --> 00:25:35.745
through life from their perspective.

490
00:25:35.845 --> 00:25:37.705
It is a huge blessing.

491
00:25:41.075 --> 00:25:44.145
Maybe the greatest blessing though, is that hospitality

492
00:25:44.145 --> 00:25:45.745
that we're talking about builds God's kingdom.

493
00:25:47.885 --> 00:25:50.305
It, it's one of the ways God builds his kingdom

494
00:25:50.305 --> 00:25:54.625
because it builds bridges of gospel conversation

495
00:25:54.625 --> 00:25:56.505
as you serve someone and love them and care for them

496
00:25:56.505 --> 00:25:57.585
and meet the needs that they have

497
00:25:57.605 --> 00:26:00.345
as you pick them up from the airport as a new student

498
00:26:00.365 --> 00:26:03.065
to UCO, and you're driving home to their apartment

499
00:26:03.165 --> 00:26:05.105
for 30 minutes and you're helping move 'em in.

500
00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:07.945
All this stuff like that, think of the trust and care

501
00:26:08.085 --> 00:26:09.305
and conversations you have

502
00:26:09.305 --> 00:26:10.665
with someone in the middle of that.

503
00:26:10.865 --> 00:26:12.825
'cause all they know is that you've cared for them

504
00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:13.905
and love them, and they're

505
00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:15.145
interested to see what you have to say.

506
00:26:17.605 --> 00:26:20.775
That you get to model the love

507
00:26:20.965 --> 00:26:25.055
that Christ has shown us in the way you treat a stranger.

508
00:26:28.605 --> 00:26:31.465
And how it models then the eternal home

509
00:26:31.695 --> 00:26:33.425
that God has prepared for us.

510
00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:36.425
Revelation seven says, people from all nations will gather

511
00:26:36.425 --> 00:26:37.665
around the throne of God

512
00:26:37.845 --> 00:26:40.585
and even around the, the wedding feast of the lamb,

513
00:26:40.675 --> 00:26:43.285
we're gonna eat together forever and share

514
00:26:43.345 --> 00:26:46.245
and rejoice together with people from all walks of life.

515
00:26:46.515 --> 00:26:49.245
What a blessing it is to get to taste that even now.

516
00:26:51.715 --> 00:26:53.535
That's what he's given us as blessings.

517
00:26:56.385 --> 00:27:00.005
So again, Christian hospitality is not merely being

518
00:27:00.115 --> 00:27:02.245
courteous socially to every person.

519
00:27:04.755 --> 00:27:09.015
It is a gospel driven, joy filled pursuit

520
00:27:09.275 --> 00:27:11.375
of welcoming strangers for the glory

521
00:27:11.395 --> 00:27:12.775
of God and for their good.

522
00:27:14.655 --> 00:27:17.545
It's not about how perfect your home is

523
00:27:17.725 --> 00:27:19.505
or how great of a cook you are

524
00:27:19.645 --> 00:27:21.825
or how creative your party invitations are.

525
00:27:21.965 --> 00:27:25.545
That's not it. It's about having a heart so captured

526
00:27:25.965 --> 00:27:30.465
by God's welcome of you that it overflows into your welcome

527
00:27:30.805 --> 00:27:32.625
of every person you ever meet.

528
00:27:37.385 --> 00:27:41.485
And don't overthink this. It can be so simple.

529
00:27:44.505 --> 00:27:47.775
Start small, but start now.

530
00:27:48.845 --> 00:27:50.175
Just invite one person

531
00:27:50.315 --> 00:27:53.575
or one family over to your house for a simple

532
00:27:54.085 --> 00:27:55.095
meal this week.

533
00:27:56.605 --> 00:27:58.855
Like you don't have to get out the whole adult Lunchable

534
00:27:59.015 --> 00:27:59.975
charcuterie board thing and

535
00:27:59.975 --> 00:28:01.095
get it all fancy and all this stuff.

536
00:28:01.095 --> 00:28:03.175
Like just throw some paper plates out there,

537
00:28:03.315 --> 00:28:05.215
get some pizza and say, Hey, come on.

538
00:28:05.215 --> 00:28:10.085
Let's, let's have a dinner. All it's about is your heart.

539
00:28:11.115 --> 00:28:13.485
It's not about entertaining or showing off or performing.

540
00:28:13.555 --> 00:28:16.005
It's about I love you and care for you. Let's talk.

541
00:28:19.635 --> 00:28:21.165
Look for the lonely person at church.

542
00:28:24.685 --> 00:28:26.465
Invite them into your life.

543
00:28:26.685 --> 00:28:28.625
Sit with you, care, care for them.

544
00:28:31.065 --> 00:28:33.335
Offer your home for a Bible study or a prayer meeting

545
00:28:33.355 --> 00:28:34.375
or something that, that we

546
00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:35.495
can just say, Hey, there's got space.

547
00:28:35.495 --> 00:28:40.365
Let's use it. Think about

548
00:28:40.365 --> 00:28:42.605
your neighborhood or your workplace and,

549
00:28:42.605 --> 00:28:44.965
and think about the people from other nations who've moved

550
00:28:44.965 --> 00:28:48.955
there or even know that at UCO,

551
00:28:48.955 --> 00:28:52.795
there are dozens, if not hundreds of international students.

552
00:28:54.415 --> 00:28:58.115
At least 80% of them never see the inside

553
00:28:58.115 --> 00:29:00.155
of an American home while they're a student here.

554
00:29:01.705 --> 00:29:05.095
That's tragic and they're long.

555
00:29:05.095 --> 00:29:06.535
They want it, they would enjoy it.

556
00:29:06.555 --> 00:29:09.935
And you could talk to someone who has a completely different

557
00:29:10.455 --> 00:29:11.775
religion, worldview, everything,

558
00:29:12.075 --> 00:29:13.575
and just say, Hey, you wanna come over

559
00:29:13.575 --> 00:29:16.415
for dinner once every couple weeks and just talk?

560
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:20.595
See what happens. It's not

561
00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:21.755
that complicated.

562
00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:27.085
Similarly though, like sit down with an immigrant

563
00:29:28.175 --> 00:29:29.515
and just ask 'em their story.

564
00:29:31.965 --> 00:29:33.775
Like you, you don't have to talk politics.

565
00:29:33.775 --> 00:29:35.375
You don't have to agree on everything,

566
00:29:35.435 --> 00:29:38.375
but just, just say, Hey, can I hear how you got here?

567
00:29:40.555 --> 00:29:42.605
It might totally transform your view

568
00:29:42.605 --> 00:29:44.045
of everything that's going on.

569
00:29:48.095 --> 00:29:50.385
Have a conversation with someone who's different than you

570
00:29:50.385 --> 00:29:53.305
politically, socially, ethnically.

571
00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:56.635
Just ask questions. You don't have to try to debate.

572
00:29:56.635 --> 00:29:58.755
You don't have to try to come at it with some angle.

573
00:29:58.755 --> 00:30:00.875
Just say, Hey, can I hear your thoughts on this?

574
00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:02.675
Tell me, tell me why you feel that way.

575
00:30:04.965 --> 00:30:06.025
And just have a conversation.

576
00:30:06.025 --> 00:30:08.785
Just try to be welcoming in that

577
00:30:09.925 --> 00:30:12.185
our theme all week at camp was, as we go,

578
00:30:12.805 --> 00:30:15.065
as we go about this, let's be praying

579
00:30:15.125 --> 00:30:16.665
and asking God to show us

580
00:30:16.665 --> 00:30:18.025
opportunities we might have been missing.

581
00:30:18.135 --> 00:30:20.665
Like that person at work that you're now seeing like, wow,

582
00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:22.345
I could have, I could have been a lot

583
00:30:22.345 --> 00:30:23.465
more intentional with them before.

584
00:30:23.495 --> 00:30:25.385
Yeah, that's who God wants you to talk to.

585
00:30:27.085 --> 00:30:28.855
Pray for opportunities, pray for his eyes

586
00:30:28.855 --> 00:30:30.175
that you might have been missing things

587
00:30:30.355 --> 00:30:33.615
and pray for a heart that would want to welcome others

588
00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:34.975
for the glory of God.

589
00:30:39.945 --> 00:30:44.615
I met Sean in 2007, right

590
00:30:44.695 --> 00:30:46.895
after we'd moved to Fort Worth so I could attend seminary.

591
00:30:46.895 --> 00:30:49.335
Emily and I moved there and lived in an apartment

592
00:30:49.395 --> 00:30:51.375
and right around the corner was an ihop.

593
00:30:51.595 --> 00:30:54.055
And so, uh, I happened to meet a man

594
00:30:54.675 --> 00:30:56.335
at our doorstep selling magazines.

595
00:30:56.335 --> 00:30:57.855
And he was down in his luck. And so I said, Hey,

596
00:30:57.855 --> 00:30:59.095
let's just go eat a meal at ihop.

597
00:30:59.095 --> 00:31:00.735
And so I had my Bible out on the table.

598
00:31:01.495 --> 00:31:03.255
I was sharing the gospel with this man, and a

599
00:31:03.255 --> 00:31:07.375
and a waiter walks up And says, is that a a bible?

600
00:31:08.495 --> 00:31:11.535
I say, yeah, it is. He said, listen, I, I'm sorry

601
00:31:11.535 --> 00:31:13.695
to interrupt, but I, I've asked a lot

602
00:31:13.695 --> 00:31:16.135
of people questions about that and, and nobody can answer.

603
00:31:16.135 --> 00:31:17.895
Would you be willing to try and answer the questions?

604
00:31:18.455 --> 00:31:20.775
I was like, yes, yes.

605
00:31:22.715 --> 00:31:25.295
And so we began to meet nearly weekly for two

606
00:31:25.295 --> 00:31:30.055
and a half years, and we'd meet at Starbucks

607
00:31:30.075 --> 00:31:31.375
or Brahms or wherever else.

608
00:31:31.635 --> 00:31:34.655
And, and, and even he came to our house a few times

609
00:31:35.795 --> 00:31:40.535
and he got to hold our firstborn son

610
00:31:41.095 --> 00:31:45.735
a newborn and experienced the excitement we had with that.

611
00:31:48.315 --> 00:31:51.535
And then he also got to see us walk

612
00:31:51.535 --> 00:31:53.215
through a miscarriage just a few months later

613
00:31:54.515 --> 00:31:57.865
and to see the peace

614
00:31:58.125 --> 00:32:01.385
and faith we had through it, plus

615
00:32:01.565 --> 00:32:04.665
how our church family came around us in that process.

616
00:32:04.925 --> 00:32:06.705
He saw all that from the inside.

617
00:32:09.645 --> 00:32:11.055
Sean would regularly talk about

618
00:32:11.675 --> 00:32:15.455
the difference he saw in my eyes that I had a peace

619
00:32:15.515 --> 00:32:18.815
and a joy that he didn't have, but that he longed for.

620
00:32:22.055 --> 00:32:26.355
See, Shawn's story is very similar to the first part

621
00:32:26.355 --> 00:32:27.875
of Rosaria Butterfield's story.

622
00:32:29.665 --> 00:32:33.965
Broken searching in every style

623
00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:35.565
of relationship for life,

624
00:32:37.715 --> 00:32:40.405
Yet denying his creator and his savior.

625
00:32:45.325 --> 00:32:47.905
Now, I wish I so wish I could give you

626
00:32:49.855 --> 00:32:52.665
that redemption moment, like in her story,

627
00:32:54.995 --> 00:32:56.495
but I don't know if Sean's story has that.

628
00:32:59.165 --> 00:33:03.465
We moved away and he changed his phone number after a while

629
00:33:03.525 --> 00:33:04.745
and I lost touch with Sean.

630
00:33:07.595 --> 00:33:10.795
I still pray for him. I have his birthday on my calendar

631
00:33:12.285 --> 00:33:14.945
and I pray that we were just like one piece of the puzzle

632
00:33:15.325 --> 00:33:19.105
for him, showing him Christian Love

633
00:33:19.885 --> 00:33:21.545
by inviting him into our lives.

634
00:33:21.615 --> 00:33:24.225
Like he had three car wrecks in two years.

635
00:33:24.325 --> 00:33:25.905
We helped pay for car repairs.

636
00:33:26.165 --> 00:33:28.705
His partner left him and he was broken.

637
00:33:28.805 --> 00:33:30.105
And so we tried to care for him

638
00:33:30.105 --> 00:33:31.465
emotionally through that journey.

639
00:33:31.565 --> 00:33:33.185
And, and all these things were happening.

640
00:33:33.185 --> 00:33:35.305
And, and so we were planting, planting,

641
00:33:35.985 --> 00:33:37.585
planting much in his life.

642
00:33:37.645 --> 00:33:40.905
And I'm praying that someone else will eventually get

643
00:33:40.905 --> 00:33:42.345
to harvest that fruit.

644
00:33:47.445 --> 00:33:51.785
I'm praying that someday he would find where I serve

645
00:33:52.165 --> 00:33:53.345
and he would walk through those doors

646
00:33:53.605 --> 00:33:54.665
on a Sunday and come down.

647
00:33:54.705 --> 00:33:55.745
I would lose it.

648
00:33:56.945 --> 00:33:58.025
I mean, I would just like,

649
00:33:58.845 --> 00:34:00.585
and he's changed, transformed by the gospel.

650
00:34:00.825 --> 00:34:02.305
I would just, I can't even imagine.

651
00:34:05.825 --> 00:34:08.045
But I don't want you to think that I'm the hero here.

652
00:34:10.485 --> 00:34:12.045
I pray that God worked through what we did

653
00:34:12.065 --> 00:34:13.365
and tried to plant in his life.

654
00:34:13.365 --> 00:34:15.925
And yes, but I think God's primary intention for

655
00:34:15.925 --> 00:34:18.845
that whole process of two and a half years was to change me.

656
00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:27.985
See, I saw Sean's life up close and I saw things

657
00:34:27.985 --> 00:34:29.945
and heard things that I'd never seen or heard before.

658
00:34:32.755 --> 00:34:36.375
He told me painfully how he had been abused

659
00:34:36.595 --> 00:34:39.745
by church leaders in all kinds of ways

660
00:34:41.525 --> 00:34:45.025
and how Christ so-called Christians treated him, said things

661
00:34:45.025 --> 00:34:47.425
to him through the rest of his life.

662
00:34:51.375 --> 00:34:53.875
See, from the beginning when he saw my Bible,

663
00:34:53.935 --> 00:34:55.595
his question was about sexuality.

664
00:34:57.835 --> 00:34:59.295
And he's trying to figure that out

665
00:34:59.295 --> 00:35:00.575
and trying to wonder through that and,

666
00:35:00.595 --> 00:35:01.655
and struggling with things.

667
00:35:01.795 --> 00:35:04.615
And, and so he asked me all the time about that.

668
00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:07.375
And listen, I never wavered on what the Bible says.

669
00:35:07.755 --> 00:35:08.855
We disagreed on that.

670
00:35:11.685 --> 00:35:13.025
But it gave me an empathy

671
00:35:14.835 --> 00:35:16.855
For The struggle

672
00:35:17.685 --> 00:35:20.885
That he has And what he's experienced

673
00:35:21.395 --> 00:35:25.325
that led him in many ways to, that I had compassion

674
00:35:26.265 --> 00:35:27.525
as I understood him more.

675
00:35:28.495 --> 00:35:29.855
I had compassion for him

676
00:35:30.405 --> 00:35:32.295
Because I genuinely loved him.

677
00:35:33.805 --> 00:35:38.645
And I longed still longed for Christ to be his redeemer,

678
00:35:39.665 --> 00:35:42.685
to take all of that and, and wash it away

679
00:35:42.905 --> 00:35:44.125
and make him a new creation.

680
00:35:44.365 --> 00:35:46.365
I i pray that that's what would happen.

681
00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:50.365
But it felt deep in my soul. That was my longing for him.

682
00:35:54.305 --> 00:35:57.405
And so listen, church, we are conditioned

683
00:35:58.225 --> 00:35:59.485
to fear the stranger.

684
00:36:02.785 --> 00:36:05.965
Our media amplifies the anxieties we

685
00:36:06.115 --> 00:36:07.845
feel of the other.

686
00:36:12.025 --> 00:36:16.925
But Christian hospitality is an act of faith over fear.

687
00:36:19.505 --> 00:36:23.125
And it's a way to treat every person as the image bearer

688
00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:24.445
of God that they are,

689
00:36:25.585 --> 00:36:29.805
and to point them to the perfect image that we are aiming

690
00:36:29.825 --> 00:36:32.885
to see their lives redeemed by and

691
00:36:33.265 --> 00:36:37.365
and drawn towards like

692
00:36:37.365 --> 00:36:38.605
it's grace and truth.

693
00:36:38.945 --> 00:36:42.645
We can have both. It's possible to be both at the same time.

694
00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:51.945
So here's the question. In a

695
00:36:52.065 --> 00:36:56.745
gated community world, how are we going

696
00:36:56.765 --> 00:37:00.225
to open our homes and our hearts,

697
00:37:00.235 --> 00:37:04.225
Especially To welcome those

698
00:37:05.895 --> 00:37:07.665
that the world casts off

699
00:37:09.565 --> 00:37:11.665
who are strangers to God?

700
00:37:13.405 --> 00:37:17.785
How, how can we do that today? How can we do that this week?

701
00:37:20.995 --> 00:37:22.585
Let's pray towards that right now.

702
00:37:25.695 --> 00:37:28.865
Lord, we, God we need you every hour.

703
00:37:29.085 --> 00:37:32.945
We need you our one

704
00:37:32.945 --> 00:37:34.185
defense, our righteousness.

705
00:37:34.325 --> 00:37:35.985
You are our hope.

706
00:37:39.435 --> 00:37:41.945
Thankfully God, our living hope that we don't have

707
00:37:41.945 --> 00:37:45.785
to walk in pursuit of this, the challenge that it is.

708
00:37:45.785 --> 00:37:48.145
We don't have to walk in this with any fear

709
00:37:49.535 --> 00:37:50.865
that it won't turn out well.

710
00:37:50.885 --> 00:37:52.105
We already know the end of the story

711
00:37:56.875 --> 00:37:58.015
and you've called us to this.

712
00:37:58.275 --> 00:38:00.735
God, I pray for our idols of our hearts, things

713
00:38:00.735 --> 00:38:01.855
that need to be ripped out.

714
00:38:01.855 --> 00:38:03.215
You'd just destroy those today

715
00:38:06.635 --> 00:38:08.055
and be willing to be uncomfortable.

716
00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:10.815
We'd be willing to be a little bit outta control,

717
00:38:11.075 --> 00:38:14.215
to be willing to, to look funny to the world

718
00:38:14.355 --> 00:38:15.655
or to even other believers

719
00:38:15.655 --> 00:38:18.255
because God, our heart is to obey you,

720
00:38:21.555 --> 00:38:25.655
to look for those who are strangers, dangers

721
00:38:28.275 --> 00:38:31.815
to love those who others consider unlovable

722
00:38:37.395 --> 00:38:38.925
because God, you did that for us

723
00:38:41.935 --> 00:38:43.085
while we were enemies.

724
00:38:43.855 --> 00:38:44.685
Crest died for us.

725
00:38:49.145 --> 00:38:50.245
So Lord, may we be heart.

726
00:38:51.345 --> 00:38:55.215
May our hearts be to obey you,

727
00:38:56.315 --> 00:39:01.055
to seek to show hospitality in the way you've shown it

728
00:39:01.055 --> 00:39:05.215
to us, for your glory, for their good,

729
00:39:05.215 --> 00:39:09.175
and ultimately God, for our good changes us.

730
00:39:09.195 --> 00:39:11.575
So help us Lord. But again, thank you

731
00:39:12.525 --> 00:39:13.975
that you showed us how to do it.

732
00:39:14.605 --> 00:39:16.175
Left the glory and comfort of heaven,

733
00:39:16.235 --> 00:39:19.255
to pursue strangers like us to live the perfect death life.

734
00:39:19.255 --> 00:39:22.255
We couldn't live to die. The death we deserve to defeat sin

735
00:39:22.255 --> 00:39:23.655
and death and the resurrection so

736
00:39:23.655 --> 00:39:26.055
that we can have a living hope that we celebrate in you.

737
00:39:26.155 --> 00:39:27.735
God, may that so compel us

738
00:39:27.915 --> 00:39:31.335
to live an overflowing life towards you

739
00:39:31.595 --> 00:39:33.615
and what you have for us, for your glory.

740
00:39:33.675 --> 00:39:36.695
In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Amen.

741
00:39:36.695 --> 00:39:37.295
If you're able, let's stand.
