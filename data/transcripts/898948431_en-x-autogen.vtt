00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:03.155
All right.

2
00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:06.995
Good morning. Welcome to this gathering of Henderson Hills.

3
00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:08.875
It's not New Year yet,

4
00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.955
but we can kind of say Happy New Year, I guess, right?

5
00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:13.315
Uh, if you are new to our church,

6
00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:15.755
we're thankful you would choose to be with us today.

7
00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:17.515
Uh, we know it's, it's a big step

8
00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:19.915
to venture into a new place maybe for the first time,

9
00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:20.835
or you've been here a couple times,

10
00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:22.075
but we're grateful you're here.

11
00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:23.835
Please introduce yourself to us.

12
00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:25.675
Come let us know that you're here, uh,

13
00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:27.355
either up here at the front after the service

14
00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:29.315
or at the new here area out there.

15
00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:31.915
We'd love to meet you. There's a QR code in the seat back if

16
00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:33.515
you want to do that as well.

17
00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:36.635
Now, today we'll be a,

18
00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:39.235
a little bit different than a normal worship gathering

19
00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:43.155
because we are kicking off a week of prayer today.

20
00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:46.555
And so this whole week ahead of us will be, uh,

21
00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:47.955
various gatherings throughout the week.

22
00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:51.035
You can see that on your little, uh, announcement sheet

23
00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:52.355
that you got coming in to see it on the

24
00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:53.635
website, either, either way.

25
00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:57.035
But what we're gonna do today is, is kick that off in a way

26
00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:02.675
with, uh, a, a, a gathering of prayer that will be led

27
00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:05.915
with songs of praise, times of prayer,

28
00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.435
where you'll be involved, you'll be receiving,

29
00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.675
you'll be giving in some ways as well.

30
00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:13.755
We won't ask you to pray out loud if you're not

31
00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:14.875
comfortable with that yet.

32
00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:18.835
But we do want you to know that this is participation,

33
00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.715
involvement is what we're asking today,

34
00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.515
because the more you get into it,

35
00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.755
the more you will get out of it as well.

36
00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:28.195
Now, we often talk about revival.

37
00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:31.675
Uh, the church in America needs to be revived,

38
00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:35.115
needs revival, or, uh, an awakening, those kind of things,

39
00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:37.155
seeing people turn back to God.

40
00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:40.115
That's good of course, to desire that.

41
00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:43.915
But I know that I often am tempted to merely want that

42
00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:46.395
without anything involved.

43
00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:49.835
Like just God do something. We want revival.

44
00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:52.275
Well, here's what someone said about that.

45
00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:53.955
To desire revival.

46
00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:56.155
And at the same time, neglect prayer

47
00:01:56.295 --> 00:02:00.675
and devotion is to wish one way and walk another.

48
00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:08.035
And so when we look at what God says about his at the time,

49
00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:11.555
the, the temple, Jesus said, this is a house

50
00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:13.555
of prayer for all nations.

51
00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:16.555
Now we know that that's not a building anymore

52
00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:19.515
because we as the people of God are the temple.

53
00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:24.675
So we are still to be a house of prayer.

54
00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:26.235
And so prayer's a significant part

55
00:02:26.235 --> 00:02:29.275
of the relationship we have with God as the all nations.

56
00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:30.715
Now that we are, it's worship.

57
00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:35.075
And so we're going to participate in that as the house

58
00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:38.435
of prayer because we can approach the throne of God,

59
00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:41.435
the Lord's presence through Christ.

60
00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:44.715
Hebrews force has led us approach God's throne of grace

61
00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:47.155
with confidence so that we may receive mercy

62
00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:49.595
and find grace to help us in our time of need.

63
00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:52.715
So that's gonna be the theme of today,

64
00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:55.675
to approach the throne of God with confidence

65
00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:57.835
because we are needy people.

66
00:02:58.015 --> 00:03:02.885
Let that be the theme of our day today as we walk

67
00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:04.085
through this journey together.

68
00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:09.005
Uh, let's participate with that being our filter today

69
00:03:09.225 --> 00:03:10.365
and all week.

70
00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:12.885
So we continue our time of prayer.

71
00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:18.245
We want to next practice meditating and awaiting.

72
00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:21.245
And what does that mean exactly?

73
00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:25.245
The world has lots of suggestions for how

74
00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:26.565
to meditate these days,

75
00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:31.685
but biblical meditation is simply taking time

76
00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:34.165
to think deeply about God's word.

77
00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.245
It's not the process of clearing your mind,

78
00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.685
as the gurus might say,

79
00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:44.685
but of filling your mind with scripture or with truth.

80
00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:49.925
Uh, the word meditation simply means to chew on

81
00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:51.485
or to absorb.

82
00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:56.245
If you think about how you chew food versus

83
00:03:56.385 --> 00:04:00.845
how you chew gum, we chew food for just a few seconds

84
00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:04.765
and we swallow it, but then we might chew gum for hours

85
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.605
absorbing all of its flavor.

86
00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:10.005
And that's biblical meditation,

87
00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:11.485
and that's what we want to do this morning.

88
00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.685
So listen to a few of these verses.

89
00:04:14.685 --> 00:04:18.925
Joshua one, eight, this book of the law, God's word

90
00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:21.045
shall not depart from your mouth,

91
00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:22.805
but you shall meditate on it.

92
00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:25.565
Chew on it, day and night.

93
00:04:26.815 --> 00:04:27.925
Psalm one, verse three.

94
00:04:28.155 --> 00:04:30.205
Blessed is the man who delights in the law.

95
00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:33.765
The Lord God's word on his law.

96
00:04:33.865 --> 00:04:37.605
He meditates or choose day and night.

97
00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:43.485
Psalm one 19, how I love your law God's word.

98
00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:46.085
It's my meditation all day long.

99
00:04:47.505 --> 00:04:49.965
We wanna take a minute to meditate

100
00:04:50.945 --> 00:04:53.645
on a particular passage outta Psalm 62.

101
00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:57.005
So let me read this slowly, carefully.

102
00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:59.765
I'll make a few comments and then we'll pray together.

103
00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:06.045
Psalm 62, verse five, for God alone, oh my soul,

104
00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:08.325
wait in silence.

105
00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:11.125
For my hope is from him.

106
00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:17.485
He only is my rock in my salvation, my fortress,

107
00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:19.925
I shall not be shaken

108
00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:26.565
on my God, rest my salvation

109
00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:29.885
and my glory, my mighty rock.

110
00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:32.965
My refuge is God.

111
00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:35.685
Trust in Him at all times

112
00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:38.485
and pour out your heart before him.

113
00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:41.125
God is a refuge for us.

114
00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:46.085
So what's being said in Psalm 62 verses five through eight?

115
00:05:46.465 --> 00:05:49.205
Our hope is in God alone.

116
00:05:50.825 --> 00:05:52.325
Our hope is in God alone.

117
00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:56.325
Why notice the names that the psalmist uses for God.

118
00:05:56.395 --> 00:05:59.965
He's our rock, our fortress, our refuge,

119
00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:03.525
our salvation, and our glory.

120
00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:05.965
And why does any of that matter?

121
00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:10.165
Because we can trust in Him at all times.

122
00:06:11.845 --> 00:06:14.805
Whatever we're facing, we will not be shaken.

123
00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:18.925
'cause we can trust in Him. How do we do that?

124
00:06:20.135 --> 00:06:23.325
Psalm says, pour out your heart to the Lord

125
00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:27.325
and wait in silence for him to respond.

126
00:06:27.825 --> 00:06:31.445
You know, waiting might be the hardest part of prayer.

127
00:06:35.425 --> 00:06:40.325
We know to pray, we know the things to say in a prayer,

128
00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:44.645
but waiting, waiting is difficult.

129
00:06:47.075 --> 00:06:50.525
Waiting might be the hardest part of prayer.

130
00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:52.485
Sometimes God responds immediately.

131
00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:55.805
Sometimes he takes days, weeks,

132
00:06:56.795 --> 00:06:57.925
even longer than that.

133
00:06:58.425 --> 00:07:03.085
So what do we do while we are waiting for God to respond,

134
00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:06.245
we pray, pray some more.

135
00:07:07.185 --> 00:07:10.045
We listen in silence.

136
00:07:10.385 --> 00:07:15.365
We meditate, chew on God's word on truth.

137
00:07:16.425 --> 00:07:20.165
We wait in expectation for him to answer us.

138
00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.125
We rest.

139
00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:27.685
The Bible says in Him, we, we we're not anxious.

140
00:07:28.905 --> 00:07:31.965
We have peace. We won't be shaken.

141
00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:34.645
We, we, we run to him as our refuge.

142
00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:36.965
So let's do that right now.

143
00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:41.525
Wherever you're at right now in your life, in your,

144
00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:43.805
in this time of the year,

145
00:07:44.205 --> 00:07:47.405
whatever's happening circumstance wise, let's take a minute

146
00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:52.245
to pray and wait for God to answer.

147
00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:56.085
So right there where you're at in your seat, take a moment

148
00:07:56.665 --> 00:07:57.805
to pour out your heart

149
00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:03.045
to the Lord he loves you, he caress for you.

150
00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:08.365
He wants to hear from you. Speak to him right now.

151
00:08:16.235 --> 00:08:20.125
What are those things that concern you right now?

152
00:08:21.675 --> 00:08:23.445
What are those things that are weighing you down?

153
00:08:26.525 --> 00:08:28.215
Give them to the Lord.

154
00:08:28.515 --> 00:08:31.855
Lay them at his feet and ask for his help.

155
00:08:37.275 --> 00:08:38.335
One of the things that happens

156
00:08:38.675 --> 00:08:43.535
as you wait on the Lord in prayer is he'll convict you of

157
00:08:44.505 --> 00:08:47.255
where you've fallen short of the glory of God sin.

158
00:08:48.275 --> 00:08:50.615
And so we move now into a time of confession.

159
00:08:52.035 --> 00:08:55.285
Now, to confess your sins to God is not to tell him anything

160
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:56.485
that he doesn't already know.

161
00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:01.425
But what it is is restoring the relationship

162
00:09:01.685 --> 00:09:04.265
as you clear out the clouds that have

163
00:09:05.055 --> 00:09:07.105
have hidden that relationship.

164
00:09:07.165 --> 00:09:09.385
It doesn't mean he went anywhere. He didn't go anywhere.

165
00:09:09.445 --> 00:09:14.095
You did. And so the idea is to clear that out

166
00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:17.535
and confess and experience his cleansing forgiveness

167
00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:20.375
as one John one, nine says, when we confess our sins,

168
00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:23.495
he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins

169
00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:25.935
and to cleanse us from all our unrighteousness.

170
00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:29.015
And that's drawing back into that relationship

171
00:09:29.015 --> 00:09:32.335
that we already had as a believer with him.

172
00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:34.705
We're not getting re-saved,

173
00:09:34.705 --> 00:09:36.585
we're just restoring a relationship.

174
00:09:36.685 --> 00:09:38.585
But to, to confess and,

175
00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:42.065
and to ask for forgiveness demands something,

176
00:09:43.405 --> 00:09:47.785
it demands that we first admit that we need it.

177
00:09:48.615 --> 00:09:50.795
That we need forgiveness for something

178
00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:53.315
that we first confess humbly.

179
00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:56.075
Because instinctively we, we wiggle,

180
00:09:57.635 --> 00:09:59.175
we point the finger like Adam

181
00:09:59.235 --> 00:10:01.095
and Eve did in the garden at someone else.

182
00:10:03.095 --> 00:10:07.845
Instead, we need to humbly recognize each of us as a sinner,

183
00:10:08.245 --> 00:10:11.525
recognize where we've fallen short, confess that

184
00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:14.045
to the Lord, agree with him in that,

185
00:10:14.675 --> 00:10:16.805
that we've sinned against him.

186
00:10:17.865 --> 00:10:20.165
And so we're gonna leave some space here. Quiet.

187
00:10:21.265 --> 00:10:24.925
Uh, we don't often get quiet in our lives.

188
00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:30.555
So this space is a time for you, just by yourself, quietly

189
00:10:31.245 --> 00:10:33.515
confessing to the Lord where you know

190
00:10:33.735 --> 00:10:36.635
and he agree with him, you've fallen shore.

191
00:10:36.655 --> 00:10:38.955
So take some time as he prompts you.

192
00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:41.755
Um, he will, he will answer that prayer.

193
00:10:43.405 --> 00:10:46.395
Psalm 1 39, search my heart and know me right now.

194
00:10:46.415 --> 00:10:48.195
Do that quietly by yourself.

195
00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:49.955
Then I'll lead us through some times

196
00:10:50.315 --> 00:10:52.475
together throughout history.

197
00:10:52.475 --> 00:10:56.875
There's also been times of corporate gathered confession

198
00:10:58.285 --> 00:11:03.195
where someone confesses sin on behalf of the whole.

199
00:11:04.615 --> 00:11:06.515
So I wanna do that now with some scripture

200
00:11:06.735 --> 00:11:11.255
and some prayers in a pastoral way to care

201
00:11:11.995 --> 00:11:16.335
for our own hearts, to recognize where we need to as a body

202
00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:19.135
or as individuals confess to the Lord.

203
00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.575
We've already sang it today,

204
00:11:21.575 --> 00:11:24.655
but Psalm 1 35, 15 through 18 says, the idols

205
00:11:24.655 --> 00:11:26.855
of the nations are silver and gold.

206
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:30.015
The work of human hands, they have mouths but don't speak.

207
00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:33.055
They have eyes but don't see they have ears, but don't hear,

208
00:11:33.195 --> 00:11:34.615
nor is there breath in their mouths.

209
00:11:35.145 --> 00:11:37.535
Those who make the idols become like them.

210
00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:41.855
So do all who trust in them. Confession can be a hard thing.

211
00:11:44.255 --> 00:11:45.295
'cause again, it's humbling

212
00:11:45.795 --> 00:11:48.735
to admit your failure, admit your weakness.

213
00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:53.885
But remember this, as you confess,

214
00:11:55.245 --> 00:11:58.595
there is more grace in God than sin in you.

215
00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:02.825
Pray is God. And so not only do we have a time

216
00:12:02.825 --> 00:12:04.905
of confession, we have a time of assurance

217
00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:08.725
because the reality is we come broken.

218
00:12:10.065 --> 00:12:13.405
And the assurance we have when we come broken

219
00:12:13.585 --> 00:12:15.485
to the Lord is the cross of Christ

220
00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:21.165
who showed his love for us by pouring out his blood

221
00:12:21.225 --> 00:12:24.005
to atone for our sin.

222
00:12:24.145 --> 00:12:26.445
All that you've just confessed, all you didn't even want

223
00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:28.405
to confess, yet all you will confess later

224
00:12:28.405 --> 00:12:30.365
that's covered under the blood of Christ.

225
00:12:30.365 --> 00:12:33.085
That is the assurance we have.

226
00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:38.125
And so walk into that as you have

227
00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:41.245
received this conviction of sin

228
00:12:41.265 --> 00:12:43.685
and confessed it, received the forgiveness,

229
00:12:44.275 --> 00:12:48.805
walk in the beauty walk like the son did in the parable

230
00:12:48.805 --> 00:12:51.885
of the prodigal son, walk home like he did.

231
00:12:54.825 --> 00:12:56.285
You might think, I don't have the words.

232
00:12:56.445 --> 00:12:59.565
I don't know how to say it right, so that God will forgive

233
00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:01.525
so that I can come home.

234
00:13:01.525 --> 00:13:04.165
Listen, it was never the son's speech

235
00:13:04.515 --> 00:13:05.525
that brought him home, right?

236
00:13:07.505 --> 00:13:09.165
It was merely the fact that he came

237
00:13:09.165 --> 00:13:09.845
Home. Yes,

238
00:13:10.785 --> 00:13:11.785
Yes. And his father

239
00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:13.485
was looking for

240
00:13:13.485 --> 00:13:14.485
Him.

241
00:13:16.265 --> 00:13:17.365
So come home.

242
00:13:17.385 --> 00:13:19.525
If you're looking for words though, maybe you're like, okay,

243
00:13:19.645 --> 00:13:20.885
I don't know what to even say.

244
00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:24.085
Well, okay, here's an illustration from God's word,

245
00:13:24.085 --> 00:13:28.365
king David sin in probably the deepest way you can ever

246
00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:29.365
imagine sinning

247
00:13:30.145 --> 00:13:33.765
and hiding it, lying about it,

248
00:13:35.435 --> 00:13:37.445
when that sin was exposed, gave one

249
00:13:37.445 --> 00:13:39.405
of the greatest prayers of repentance. You'll ever

250
00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:44.525
See Psalm 51, have mercy on me.

251
00:13:44.525 --> 00:13:48.485
Oh God, according to your unfailing love,

252
00:13:49.435 --> 00:13:51.405
according to your great compassion,

253
00:13:51.725 --> 00:13:53.285
blot out my transgressions.

254
00:13:53.955 --> 00:13:58.205
Wash away all my iniquity. Cleanse me from my sin.

255
00:13:58.985 --> 00:14:03.045
For I know my transgressions, my sin is always before me.

256
00:14:04.105 --> 00:14:07.205
So create in me a pure heart, oh God,

257
00:14:08.975 --> 00:14:11.125
renew a steadfast spirit within me.

258
00:14:13.865 --> 00:14:14.865
God, I've come home,

259
00:14:16.305 --> 00:14:19.845
Do a work in me All

260
00:14:19.845 --> 00:14:22.245
because we have an advocate.

261
00:14:22.245 --> 00:14:26.085
We have a substitute. His name is Jesus Christ.

262
00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:28.165
And so before the throne of God,

263
00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:32.085
we have someone standing there who counts for us.

264
00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:36.125
So we're gonna sing that in assurance

265
00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:38.805
that we have a savior.

266
00:14:42.305 --> 00:14:45.085
As we enter into a time of intercessory prayer,

267
00:14:46.205 --> 00:14:47.885
I think it's important that we understand

268
00:14:47.995 --> 00:14:50.165
what intercessory prayer is

269
00:14:51.345 --> 00:14:53.965
and what our example from scripture really is.

270
00:14:54.665 --> 00:14:57.405
And so as I thought about this, um,

271
00:14:58.195 --> 00:15:00.885
what better example do we have than Christ himself?

272
00:15:02.185 --> 00:15:06.245
If we look at the pages of John, uh, chapter 17,

273
00:15:07.145 --> 00:15:10.885
we see Christ having a conversation with God the Father.

274
00:15:11.985 --> 00:15:15.925
And he's talking to him about how he has fulfilled

275
00:15:16.355 --> 00:15:20.045
what needed to be done here on earth, knowing full well

276
00:15:20.195 --> 00:15:23.485
that he's about to be betrayed and crucified.

277
00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:28.885
And in the midst of that, in verse eight, it says,

278
00:15:29.585 --> 00:15:31.885
for I have given them the words that you gave me.

279
00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.005
And they have received them

280
00:15:35.025 --> 00:15:39.205
and have come to know in the truth that I came from you

281
00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.805
and they have believed that you sent me.

282
00:15:42.605 --> 00:15:44.445
I am praying for them.

283
00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:47.405
I'm not praying for the world,

284
00:15:48.225 --> 00:15:53.125
but for those whom you have given me for, they are yours.

285
00:15:53.865 --> 00:15:56.965
So in the midst of Jesus knowing what is coming,

286
00:15:58.345 --> 00:16:01.725
he stops and he's praying for the disciples.

287
00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:06.285
He's interceding for them. He's petitioning the Lord.

288
00:16:07.105 --> 00:16:10.805
And even he goes on in verse 20, he talks about others

289
00:16:11.675 --> 00:16:14.805
that have believed and how he prays for them as well.

290
00:16:16.505 --> 00:16:21.085
And if we jump over to, uh, Romans chapter eight,

291
00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:26.245
verse 34, it talks about how Christ

292
00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:30.525
is seated at the right hand of the Father interceding

293
00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:35.925
on our behalf, knowing what we need,

294
00:16:36.915 --> 00:16:41.165
praying for forgiveness of sin, saying to God the Father

295
00:16:41.165 --> 00:16:45.165
that I've covered that saying that

296
00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:50.685
he will sustain us, saying that he will provide for us,

297
00:16:51.835 --> 00:16:54.285
that he'll give us comfort, he'll give us peace.

298
00:16:55.465 --> 00:16:58.525
So we have that person in Jesus

299
00:16:59.065 --> 00:17:01.325
who is interceding on our behalf.

300
00:17:02.785 --> 00:17:04.365
And John 1334

301
00:17:04.385 --> 00:17:08.965
and 35 says that the way that the world will know

302
00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:13.005
that we are his is by how we love each other.

303
00:17:14.225 --> 00:17:17.445
And what better way to express our love

304
00:17:17.945 --> 00:17:20.605
for one another than to pray for each other.

305
00:17:22.265 --> 00:17:26.685
And so I want to invite you to gather

306
00:17:26.825 --> 00:17:30.885
as a family unit or gather with three or four around you

307
00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:33.645
and just let's stand up and move together,

308
00:17:33.785 --> 00:17:36.285
and we're going to pray for each other.

309
00:17:37.345 --> 00:17:40.885
So let's do that. Now we'll transition

310
00:17:40.885 --> 00:17:42.005
to praying for the church.

311
00:17:42.905 --> 00:17:45.325
The apostle Paul gives us a great example

312
00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:48.365
in Philippians chapter one,

313
00:17:48.505 --> 00:17:51.285
it says To all the saints in Christ Jesus

314
00:17:51.465 --> 00:17:55.925
who are at Philippi with overseers and deacons, grace to you

315
00:17:56.545 --> 00:17:59.285
and peace from our God, our Father

316
00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:01.045
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

317
00:18:01.965 --> 00:18:05.045
I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,

318
00:18:05.905 --> 00:18:10.605
always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer

319
00:18:10.675 --> 00:18:14.925
with joy because of your partnership in the gospel

320
00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:20.205
from the first day until now, as we pray for our church,

321
00:18:21.315 --> 00:18:26.125
pray for your leadership, the staff, the elders,

322
00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:29.325
your deacons list.

323
00:18:29.435 --> 00:18:33.005
Lift us all up as a church that we might glorify God

324
00:18:35.145 --> 00:18:39.685
and that we would be most diligent in spreading his gospel.

325
00:18:40.215 --> 00:18:41.685
Let's pray for that right now.

326
00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:46.645
That's always one of the favorite things

327
00:18:47.235 --> 00:18:48.845
that we do as a church.

328
00:18:49.185 --> 00:18:51.165
Uh, we've done that a number of times the last few years.

329
00:18:51.265 --> 00:18:54.845
But to watch the body be the body in action in

330
00:18:54.845 --> 00:18:57.165
that time is really sweet to me.

331
00:18:57.705 --> 00:18:59.205
Uh, so thank you for engaging in that.

332
00:18:59.775 --> 00:19:01.965
Maybe that was a stretch for you. That's okay.

333
00:19:02.945 --> 00:19:06.405
Um, this should be a safe place for us to be able

334
00:19:06.405 --> 00:19:08.245
to share a need we have.

335
00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:13.435
But we know ultimately that those people in

336
00:19:13.435 --> 00:19:16.515
that circle though they care for you, love you

337
00:19:19.015 --> 00:19:23.635
in the end, cannot do anything to change

338
00:19:24.385 --> 00:19:27.875
what you've asked for prayer for, right?

339
00:19:28.195 --> 00:19:31.635
I mean, that's just the reality of our limited humanness.

340
00:19:33.975 --> 00:19:35.315
But that's why we pray

341
00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:40.035
because we are taking it to the one

342
00:19:40.655 --> 00:19:42.275
who can do something about it.

343
00:19:44.665 --> 00:19:47.725
So all over scripture, you see these times of invitation.

344
00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:54.925
You see Jesus in Matthew 11 say, come

345
00:19:54.925 --> 00:19:58.245
to me all who are weary and burdened.

346
00:19:59.525 --> 00:20:00.445
I will give you rest.

347
00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:08.485
He was echoing what God said in Isaiah 55,

348
00:20:09.035 --> 00:20:10.725
come all who are thirsty.

349
00:20:12.615 --> 00:20:14.325
Revelation, you hear over

350
00:20:14.325 --> 00:20:16.445
and over come those who are thirsty.

351
00:20:19.825 --> 00:20:23.725
And, and it's all in the context of coming to the, the,

352
00:20:24.145 --> 00:20:27.925
the fountain of living water that there is no end to.

353
00:20:30.905 --> 00:20:35.885
And so we are going to, as the needy ones,

354
00:20:38.465 --> 00:20:41.845
create space for us to come to the one

355
00:20:41.945 --> 00:20:43.765
who can meet our needs.

356
00:20:44.955 --> 00:20:46.765
Hopefully, we've been doing that all morning, of course,

357
00:20:46.825 --> 00:20:48.605
and you're doing that all day every day.

358
00:20:48.865 --> 00:20:53.485
But but a, a purposed moment for that to happen.

359
00:20:56.585 --> 00:20:59.845
So we know that in the ancient days, they would come

360
00:20:59.845 --> 00:21:03.965
to the temple to bring their needs to God in a sense.

361
00:21:04.345 --> 00:21:08.765
But we approach God now as the temple in prayer,

362
00:21:11.415 --> 00:21:13.365
still with the holiness and reverence.

363
00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:16.565
That is his holiness demands of us.

364
00:21:16.705 --> 00:21:18.725
But we come because as we've said,

365
00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:23.165
Christ is our intercessor.

366
00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:25.725
He is the one Hebrews seven says, able

367
00:21:25.725 --> 00:21:28.285
to save completely those who come to God through him,

368
00:21:28.435 --> 00:21:30.725
because he always lives to intercede for them.

369
00:21:30.785 --> 00:21:33.805
That's how we can come to the throne of God

370
00:21:34.015 --> 00:21:35.405
above with our needs.

371
00:21:37.385 --> 00:21:41.925
And so I want to invite you to come to the Lord

372
00:21:42.085 --> 00:21:43.605
through Christ today.

373
00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:47.365
Maybe that's the first time.

374
00:21:47.495 --> 00:21:48.805
Maybe you're seeing this,

375
00:21:49.635 --> 00:21:52.005
this one in your place for the first time.

376
00:21:52.265 --> 00:21:53.805
Praise God for that.

377
00:21:56.185 --> 00:22:00.725
But all of us come to God through Christ today.

378
00:22:01.545 --> 00:22:06.005
We humbly needy, come to him.

379
00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:11.805
And there's, there's something about movement

380
00:22:13.435 --> 00:22:15.405
that creates a memory.

381
00:22:17.705 --> 00:22:20.645
And I know throughout history, this has been debated back

382
00:22:20.645 --> 00:22:23.725
and forth about coming forward in a church service.

383
00:22:23.905 --> 00:22:27.285
And we, we have differing opinions in this room on that

384
00:22:27.385 --> 00:22:28.685
and how it all works and all.

385
00:22:28.695 --> 00:22:31.325
We're not trying to be manipulative in any way in this.

386
00:22:31.345 --> 00:22:34.325
But there's something about it that when you take a step,

387
00:22:35.945 --> 00:22:38.485
it creates a marker in your heart.

388
00:22:40.865 --> 00:22:44.525
You don't have to come to any forward altar type thing

389
00:22:45.125 --> 00:22:48.925
'cause you're the altar now to come

390
00:22:48.925 --> 00:22:51.525
to Jesus that's in here.

391
00:22:52.985 --> 00:22:54.565
But there might be a measure of faith

392
00:22:54.565 --> 00:22:57.485
that you can step forward into today.

393
00:22:57.635 --> 00:22:59.165
Plus you might need somebody to pray

394
00:22:59.165 --> 00:23:01.485
with you about whatever you're feeling and facing right now.

395
00:23:04.665 --> 00:23:08.405
And so in this time, whatever you're feeling facing,

396
00:23:08.405 --> 00:23:10.125
there'll be a few people down here at the front,

397
00:23:10.435 --> 00:23:15.165
some elders, some of our prayer team if you need to,

398
00:23:15.465 --> 00:23:16.885
to talk to someone, pray with someone.

399
00:23:17.185 --> 00:23:20.725
Or maybe you just need to, again symbolically,

400
00:23:20.725 --> 00:23:23.005
there's nothing super spiritual about it,

401
00:23:23.025 --> 00:23:26.245
but just to come kneel up here where, where you're showing

402
00:23:27.045 --> 00:23:30.045
yourself not anybody else, you're not performing yourself

403
00:23:30.045 --> 00:23:34.765
where your heart is A step of faith to say

404
00:23:34.765 --> 00:23:37.445
to the Lord God, I need you again.

405
00:23:37.445 --> 00:23:38.485
You can do that right where you sit.

406
00:23:38.485 --> 00:23:39.605
You can kneel right where you are.

407
00:23:39.625 --> 00:23:41.525
You can stand, you can sit, you can do whatever.

408
00:23:41.525 --> 00:23:43.845
It's a posture of your heart. That's the point.

409
00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:50.325
But this is the time as we sing this song, Lord, I need you

410
00:23:51.185 --> 00:23:53.325
to let this be our cry.

411
00:23:54.415 --> 00:23:55.885
Every one of us needs him.

412
00:23:56.945 --> 00:23:59.565
And so let this be our cry as we

413
00:24:00.825 --> 00:24:04.525
invite one another to come to Jesus.
