1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.200
Who is

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.500
the god like Yahweh the god

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.200
of wrath the god of Mercy The

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.900
God Who reaches down to unworthy people.

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.900
Well Merry Christmas church.

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.500
So you're like did I miss something here? I know went

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
to bed early that I hibernate for two months. No. Okay. Listen, I

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.200
know it's cooler outside and maybe I'm

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.500
just really Desiring Christmas season, but you are

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.600
not crazy. We are still walking through

11
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.100
this journey through Micah in the

12
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.000
Old Testament where we are seeing God's fullness. But

13
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.400
but today we get to come to

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.400
a passage that's pretty familiar predicting this

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.900
Messiah who is coming.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.300
And it's one that we often use at Christmas because it talks about this little town

17
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.800
called Bethlehem.

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.400
And so to celebrate I brought this little Christmas tree up here

19
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.800
that I keep in my study over in the offices and just keep

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.800
it up there all year round. I don't know where Emily and I obtained this

21
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.200
but somehow it came

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.000
to our house and it sure came in handy when we were

23
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.800
in Fort Worth a few years ago.

24
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.400
See if you didn't know my wife and I both have engineering degrees

25
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.200
from Oklahoma State University and we went

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.400
to Seminary. I went to Seminary in Fort

27
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.200
Worth. And so while I was in summary actually worked for two years

28
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
designing HVAC systems in buildings using my

29
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.500
degree which eight to five traveling for

30
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.600
work battling traffic the whole deal like working

31
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.300
with unbelievers all that. I experience that and

32
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.400
by the way, I'm so thankful for that because it gave me a picture of what

33
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.000
real real Ministry in the world looks like like

34
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.600
when you go to work during the week, I understand what

35
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.800
that is. So God blessed me with that opportunity, but I

36
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.800
started working at that company right before Christmas.

37
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.800
And so I brought this little Christmas tree to my cubicle and I

38
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.400
put it right up on top the top highest shelf

39
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.200
in my cubicle where we're really everybody could see as

40
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.400
they walk by could see it from a kind of across the room and those kind

41
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.200
of things and other people had Decor up and stuff like that. So I

42
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700
wasn't the only one

43
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.300
the difference was I just left this up all year.

44
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.800
Now I probably just forgot to take it home in January. But but

45
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.000
it really worked out providentially for me in a

46
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.600
number of different ways because people would walk by like in

47
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.800
February or June and they'd

48
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.000
be like, you know Christmas was a

49
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.900
couple months ago, right?

50
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.000
And and I would have the opportunity.

51
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.700
This this question provided an opportunity for me to actually

52
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.800
get to the gospel.

53
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.700
Because my response to them would be Hey, listen

54
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.900
for me every day is Christmas Day.

55
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.100
Now they'd go report me to HR. But anyway, it was

56
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.100
like this thing of like I don't think he's saying but it was the

57
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.000
idea that I would tell them.

58
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.200
This reality that it's not just a holiday to celebrate once

59
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.800
a year for us who are believers.

60
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.100
That this is something that signifies.

61
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.400
That our Savior King has come and that

62
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.000
changes everything.

63
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.500
Like this is reality. Something has happened that if God

64
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.300
really did take on human flesh to come

65
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.900
save us then that deserves a year-round celebration,

66
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.900
right? That's not just a little few week

67
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.200
few days in a week at the end of

68
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.600
the year.

69
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.100
In fact, that's the main point. We're going to see today actually.

70
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.800
In Micah 5. We'll see that that every day is Christmas

71
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.200
Day.

72
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.100
so rejoice

73
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.600
every day is Christmas Day.

74
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.900
So Rejoice take heart.

75
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.600
Take joy.

76
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.700
Because the Messiah has come.

77
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400
That changes everything.

78
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.400
And so let's turn now to Micah chapter 5.

79
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.500
Micah chapter 5 is where we're going to be today. I'm

80
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.200
going to call a little bit of an audible today. We had

81
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.300
planned Micah five two through

82
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.400
nine for today and some of you may have even studied

83
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.800
that this morning or will in your community groups. We are

84
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.700
still going to cover that but I realize as

85
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.900
I Was preparing that I bit off a little bit too much to chew in

86
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.100
those eight verses and so what we're

87
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.100
gonna do is shift.

88
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.300
The second part of verse 5 all the way down through verse 9 on

89
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.200
to next week and it'll be with verses 10

90
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.900
through 15. It's actually going to fit well together in that as well.

91
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.300
But today we're just going to focus in on

92
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.600
verses 2 through the first line of verse 5.

93
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.400
Very familiar passage, but here's what I believe God

94
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400
wanted to do with this.

95
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.200
Sovereign right so he knew this was coming he new how this would work

96
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.200
out this week. And so what he wants to do, I believe as I

97
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.100
was seeing him do that in me this week as I Was

98
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.700
preparing it these few verses

99
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.100
Will lead us to just stare at

100
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.300
Jesus for the next 30 or 40 minutes.

101
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.500
Like to just gaze at his glory

102
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.500
because that's what we're gonna see in this passage. I'm going to get Christmas in October

103
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.400
Christmas and Micah

104
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.200
It's just going to tell us about the Messiah.

105
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.200
Just who he is who he was who he's going to

106
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.600
be like this. This should not be a lot of application today

107
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.100
right now. I can get this thing to walk out here. This is what I should do

108
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.600
today this week. No, that's not gonna be that. It's just gonna look at Jesus.

109
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.200
Going to lead us to respond in worship with

110
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.600
our whole lives more fully.

111
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.300
Which I'm fine with if you're fine with rest sound good, right? Like let's just

112
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.100
look at Jesus for the next 30 minutes.

113
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.500
So see if this passage. I read it see if

114
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.400
it sounds Christmassy to you.

115
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.100
Because all through Micah we've seen we've been

116
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.000
looking for this deliver looking for this king that's coming.

117
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.500
Listen to what? This says versus two through

118
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.600
the first line of verse 5.

119
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.000
Says but you o Bethlehem.

120
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.300
Ephratha you who are too little to be among the clans of

121
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.200
Judah from you shall come forth for me

122
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200
one who is to be ruler in Israel.

123
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.100
Who's coming forth is from of old from ancient days?

124
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.300
Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who

125
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.400
is in labor has given birth.

126
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.700
Then the rest of his brothers shall return to the people of Israel.

127
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.400
And he this this ruler shall

128
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.100
stand and Shepherd his flock in the strength of

129
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.300
the Lord in the Majesty of the name of the Lord his God.

130
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.600
And they shall dwell secure.

131
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.300
For now, he shall be great to the ends of

132
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.700
the Earth.

133
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.800
Shall be their peace.

134
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.900
God we look at this and we see Christmas. Yes, but but

135
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.300
may we see you today?

136
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.700
Now pray you would open our eyes.

137
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.100
Open our hearts.

138
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.200
To just be stirred and worship with our

139
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.200
whole lives.

140
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.900
Because you've come.

141
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.700
This is who you are. May we see that in fresh ways today?

142
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.600
understand you better than ever before see how

143
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.000
this all links together and

144
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.700
and glorify you with our lives. Help us God.

145
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.900
In jesus' name we pray.

146
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.200
amen

147
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.200
and so again, what we're going to do is we're just going to gaze at this

148
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.800
Messiah deliver that we've been waiting for in Micah

149
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.100
that they were waiting for that we see here in these few

150
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.500
verses

151
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.800
just look at this Messiah who he

152
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.500
is and that should land lead us to Faith should lead

153
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.600
us to worship. Let's just study him.

154
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.500
So what do we see here about him?

155
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.000
Well first just some some basic factual information

156
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.500
about him is that this Messiah would be

157
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.000
born in Bethlehem?

158
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.100
Right just a basic Truth born in Bethlehem. In

159
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.500
fact, most people if they've been around any form of

160
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.600
church their entire lives at all. They've they've probably

161
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.300
got this one in the bank somewhere right Bethlehem is

162
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.500
where he was going to be born. Right? They they have heard that

163
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.500
somewhere or sung the song but what you might not know

164
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.600
is there actually two bethlehems in that

165
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.000
region.

166
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.500
Which is why this one is distinguished as Bethlehem Ephrata?

167
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.800
And what that word does is it links it

168
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.000
with David?

169
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.300
It links to with David's Hometown. So how how does that that's

170
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.600
King David David Goliath, right? How does it link that with David?

171
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.700
Well in 1st Samuel 17:12 we

172
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.100
read this.

173
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.500
That David was the son of an ephrathite of

174
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.100
Bethlehem in Judah named

175
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.000
Jesse.

176
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.800
So David was from this town.

177
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.800
It's important. This actually also shows up later. When

178
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.500
when Joseph who was Mary's husband. This

179
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.700
was 2,000 years ago now.

180
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.300
Joseph Mary's husband. Jesus is adopted father.

181
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.600
He took Mary with him whenever the census

182
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.100
was called for he took him back where

183
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.200
He took them back to Bethlehem, which is

184
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.000
where Joseph's family was from.

185
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.000
He was an ephrathite.

186
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.400
And then we linked this with the Isaiah 11:1 it

187
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.400
predicts there shall come forth a shoot from the stump of

188
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.100
Jesse.

189
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.200
A branch from his roots shall bear fruit. So you

190
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.100
tie all of these pieces together and what you get

191
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.800
is this fulfillment of the prophecy from Micah?

192
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.000
700 years before Jesus was born that

193
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.400
the Messiah he's predicting was going

194
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.900
to be born in this little town of Bethlehem.

195
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.100
That the Savior was coming through the line of Jesse in the

196
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.900
line of David the line of Judah really from before in Genesis 49

197
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.200
that this was all going to happen in this Tiny Town

198
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.800
of Bethlehem.

199
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.700
Micah said 700 years before it happened. Here's how

200
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.000
it goes.

201
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.300
So this Messiah deliver born in Bethlehem?

202
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.700
But not just a person born somewhere

203
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.200
the second aspect of this Messiah deliver is that

204
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.800
he would be living for Yahweh.

205
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.000
It says very clearly this Messiah is going to

206
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.600
live for Yahweh in verse 2. God says out of

207
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.000
this Tiny Town one shall come forth for

208
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.300
me. Those two words for me is what we're focused

209
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:41.400
on.

210
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.300
Now I feel like an insignificant part of this verse it's

211
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.900
not that big of a deal here. Actually it is

212
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.800
because remember

213
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.400
how the vast majority of all the other

214
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.800
rulers in Israel and Judah had been

215
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.600
How had they been living?

216
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.600
They were Wicked idolatrous leaders.

217
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.900
Leading their people into their own sin.

218
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.500
Into idolatry into worshiping of the Gods this was who

219
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.500
they had been all of them had fallen short of

220
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.800
God's standard of what a king was supposed to be.

221
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.900
this King, however

222
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.300
The Messiah King would be for Yahweh.

223
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.500
Would come forth for me. God says for Yahweh

224
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.900
both in orientation the way that he's focused

225
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.500
on his life that he would be solely focused on pleasing

226
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.300
the father. He's four Yahweh, but

227
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:36.500
also

228
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.100
as a perfect representative of Yahweh.

229
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.200
He's for me.

230
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.100
Right. This is who I want you to see as a

231
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.400
representative of me. It's what Colossians 1

232
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.200
says about Jesus.

233
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.900
That he is the image of

234
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.800
the invisible God.

235
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.900
perfect picture

236
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.600
of God In the Flesh

237
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.400
And in him all the fullness of God was pleased to

238
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.400
dwell. That's who Jesus is said

239
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.300
to be that that he is for God.

240
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.400
Given for us that means everything about the

241
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.700
Messiah would perfectly point to Yahweh.

242
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.800
All these failed Kings along the way even David failed Kings

243
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.600
would not perfectly represent.

244
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.700
until the Messiah

245
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.100
it's what it Isaiah 11.

246
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.400
prophesied about this

247
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.500
one to come says the spirit of the Lord shall rest

248
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.000
upon him.

249
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.700
The spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and

250
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.900
might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.

251
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.500
And his Delight shall be in the fear of the

252
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.100
Lord. He shall not judge by what his eyes see or

253
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.600
decide disputes by what his ears hear but with righteousness he

254
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.600
shall judge the poor.

255
00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.700
And decide with equity for the meek of the Earth.

256
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.900
He shall strike the Earth with the rod of his mouth with

257
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.700
the breath of his lips. He shall kill the wicked.

258
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.000
And righteousness shall be the belt of his waist and faithfulness

259
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.200
the belt of his loins.

260
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.600
When you look through that list of what that Messiah is going to be. It sounds

261
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.700
like what Israel and Judah were missing out on right?

262
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.400
The way they were treating the poor the way they were treating the wicked,

263
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.500
right? They get preference to the evil preference to the wealthy.

264
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.500
All of that was happening. No the Messiah.

265
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.200
Will be living for Yahweh. And this is what it

266
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.600
will look like.

267
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.300
totally different

268
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:37.600
now

269
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.900
it could be that that person is different and just one

270
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.500
of many.

271
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.400
But it's really important that this Messiah would be

272
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.500
a ruler in Israel.

273
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.300
Notice, that's what it says in Micah 5 that that this one

274
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.200
who's going to be living for Yahweh is actually going to

275
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.300
be the ruler in Israel. He would take the rightful place.

276
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.900
That God was supposed to have as the king.

277
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.800
God had ordained that they were there these

278
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.800
kings that they wanted were supposed to be some certain

279
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.500
way. They've kept failing at that because

280
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.800
they were supposed to be a theocracy originally.

281
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.700
That word being means that they were supposed to be having God

282
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.100
as their King solely as a nation

283
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.400
that God was the king over them. They rebelled against

284
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.400
that they wanted an Earthly King instead. And God

285
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.200
said, okay, here you go, but they kept getting in trouble because of all

286
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.300
these Wicked kings that they had.

287
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.100
And God said, well, actually I wanted you to follow me.

288
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.700
I wanted you to follow me not these

289
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.200
people who will lead you astray who will fail you at times

290
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.400
follow me. Let me be your king. And so

291
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.200
now with the Messiah we get back to that.

292
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.200
We get back to this being the true king the Everlasting King.

293
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.400
The one who is not just a ruler in

294
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.300
Israel the one who is the ruler of Israel?

295
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.600
Totally different right the sure final

296
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.300
King that they actually need. He's the one who's going to

297
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.700
fill that void.

298
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.500
He's the one that God promised to David.

299
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.600
Back in second Samuel 7:16 when he's

300
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.800
talking to David about this family line that he has. He

301
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.600
says your house and your kingdom.

302
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.100
Shall be made sure forever before me.

303
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.500
Your throne David shall be established forever.

304
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.000
He's pointing forward to this Messiah King. Who's from

305
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.000
the line of David remember?

306
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.500
Through Jesse through Bethlehem this

307
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.700
one who's going to come?

308
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.700
Will be sure and established Forever This

309
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.800
is Jesus the one that they called son of David.

310
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.100
This is Jesus who fulfills this a ruler

311
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.000
they need?

312
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.200
But when you think about it, he says here your throne

313
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.800
will be established forever. How can someone Reign forever?

314
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.000
The only way someone can Reign forever is if they have existed from

315
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.300
eternity as well.

316
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.300
Like this is this is an eternal ruler. This is somebody who's

317
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.200
existed forever and ever both eternity

318
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.100
past and Eternity future. That's the word in verse

319
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.600
2. It says this Messiah is coming forth is

320
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.000
from of old.

321
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.800
from ancient days

322
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.300
That language is the same language used in Daniel chapter

323
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:40.800
7.

324
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.800
Talking about God and it says he is the Ancient of

325
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.700
Days.

326
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.600
same idea

327
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.600
and what that means is that God is eternal.

328
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.300
It's showing God's eternality which God himself

329
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.700
says about the Messiah here that he has existed from

330
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.500
those ancient days.

331
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.100
This is a key theological Point here that that we need

332
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.900
to keep in our minds. Remember. Jesus was not created 2,000

333
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.100
years ago in Mary's womb.

334
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.200
Like you and I are created when when those two

335
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.400
cells come together and it's a new creation. That's a whole

336
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.500
new thing. It's it's something that didn't exist before what Jesus

337
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.600
did as Eternal God the son.

338
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.200
He just took on flesh there in Mary's womb.

339
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.300
He doesn't have the seed of man.

340
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.600
like we do

341
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.900
he is God who's existed and just just take

342
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.600
on flesh.

343
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.400
So he's a hundred percent God and a hundred

344
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:44.800
percent man.

345
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.200
Living this life for us

346
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.200
and dying and resurrecting and ascending back like that's

347
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.600
that's God but it starts not at the

348
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.400
womb. It starts from eternity past.

349
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.200
I know that kind of blows our minds hard to conceive hard to get yes.

350
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.900
But what that means is that when you look at Jesus.

351
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.300
As the image of the invisible God you are looking at the

352
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.100
Eternal God.

353
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.300
You are looking at Eternal God who not

354
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.200
only existed eternity past. He's also existing into eternity

355
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:18.400
future.

356
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.400
So the one who's going to Reign on the

357
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.600
throne of David forever is someone who does exist

358
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.100
forever?

359
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:28.800
His name is Jesus.

360
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.000
But here's where things get a little tricky.

361
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.700
Not that that wasn't complicated enough, right? Okay.

362
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.400
but remember for those who were hearing this 2,700 years

363
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.100
ago as Micah was writing these and saying

364
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:45.600
these things

365
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.500
at the time this promised King that he's talking about was still

366
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.400
future for them, right?

367
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.900
I mean, they're literally in threats. They're at risk

368
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.100
for Exile and and at War and

369
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.700
So they're hoping forward future for this promised

370
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.800
Messiah this King.

371
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.400
It was all still future because if you've tracked with us through Micah here,

372
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.400
right you you remember there's a lot of pain and sorrow there

373
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.300
about to have to go through.

374
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.900
God was disciplining his people to purify and

375
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.400
refine out this Remnant and so now

376
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.900
They're going to have to go through some pain before this savior

377
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.200
would come that's what verse 3 refers to he says

378
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.700
this King will give them up until the

379
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.300
time comes.

380
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.200
He's talking about the exile.

381
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.200
He's talking about that. They're about to go to Babylon in the next hundred years

382
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.800
or so. They're going to go to Babylon for a season, but then sometime after

383
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.300
that.

384
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.100
A woman will give birth to this child.

385
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.200
And then the exiled Brothers will return.

386
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.100
And so here again, this is what we talked about a couple

387
00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.200
weeks ago this already but not yet nature of the kingdom of

388
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:00.400
God.

389
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.200
And some of that makes it really confusing when we deal with prophecy and

390
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.000
how to handle where when this was going to happen. Did it

391
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.300
happen like this time and later or is it just once or is it future is

392
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:11.900
it current?

393
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.700
We hit it here because what he's talking about was fulfilled in

394
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.200
part.

395
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.300
A couple hundred years later when the remnant of God's

396
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.400
people return to the land from Babylon.

397
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.800
That's Ezra Nehemiah you go read those books. That's their Journey back

398
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.300
into the land that they were in

399
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.900
right now that they got exiled from.

400
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.300
so there's a partial fulfillment of them coming back

401
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.200
to the land but

402
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.500
Just a shadow.

403
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.800
Because there was not full.

404
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.700
full fulfillment of all that we see here in Micah 5

405
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.000
there was not this one Messiah King who would do all of

406
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.800
these things it wasn't true yet.

407
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.800
It was a partial fulfillment.

408
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.600
But it's a shadow of the full and complete return

409
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.300
coming one day for God's people.

410
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.500
That there had to be this this woman giving birth

411
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.100
to a child.

412
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.100
And then everybody comes back together.

413
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.200
Well, we have the ability, of course to look

414
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.400
back at something that happened for

415
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.700
us 2,000 years ago for them 700 years later.

416
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.000
Where this woman named Mary did birth a

417
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.900
child. Who is this deliverer Jesus?

418
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.300
Who fulfills all these prophecies? We now look

419
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.800
back and say that's the Messiah.

420
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.500
And so that's already happened in some sense, right? It

421
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:38.900
has but

422
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.600
but the full return has not yet happened.

423
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.600
We're still in kind of this Exile period in a

424
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.300
sense where we're not unified. We're not back in

425
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.500
the land. We're not with our Messiah King reigning

426
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.300
we're not there yet. All of these things in verses three

427
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.400
through five haven't happened yet.

428
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.600
And so they have in some sense. Yes, there's glimpses of

429
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.900
it, but we're still looking forward to a day to come right?

430
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.100
When this Messiah deliverer will come back fully and finally and

431
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.000
Reign on Earth as he is right now in heaven. We are

432
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.300
looking forward to that day as well. There's a there's a

433
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.900
future element to us here as well.

434
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.100
That we're longing for something just like they were

435
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.000
longing for something.

436
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.800
But here's what this passage also does.

437
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.400
See there's this Messiah deliver. We've been talking about there's this

438
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.500
Messiah King coming. What will he

439
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:40.600
do?

440
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.200
when his kingdom fully comes

441
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.400
What is he already doing in some sense? But what he will

442
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.200
do fully verse 4 says he will Shepherd in

443
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.000
strength.

444
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.000
Just abundantly clear. He will Shepherd in strength here.

445
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.000
And that image of of shepherdings all over Micah, right?

446
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.500
They would understood that they saw Shepherds all the time. They get that

447
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.100
idea. But what we learned from this is this

448
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.900
is a picture of security protection love.

449
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.000
When he Shepherds in strength, there's a Shepherd cares

450
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.400
for and protects his flock this Messiah will

451
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.200
do the same for his sheep for those who are

452
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:22.700
his by faith.

453
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.100
He will Shepherd his flock. That's

454
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.600
what the word stand brings here.

455
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.400
Because it says he'll stand and Shepherd his flock what

456
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.600
that word stand means is that he has the authority needed to

457
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.500
complete the task.

458
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.600
and that's good news because

459
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.200
he should be if we're trusting in Him

460
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.200
to do it. He should have the authority to do it and he also not only has that

461
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.700
he has the strength of Yahweh to do it as well.

462
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.200
He's got the authority to do it. He's got the strength to

463
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.500
do it. He can be our Shepherd. That means there's nothing that can stand

464
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.700
against him.

465
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.400
There's nothing that can separate his flock from his protective hand.

466
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.900
This is the messiah.

467
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.300
and the beauty of this

468
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.400
Is that Jesus gladly takes up

469
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.900
that mantle in the New Testament?

470
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.500
We're in John. 10:14. Jesus says I am the

471
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.200
Good Shepherd.

472
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.200
right this this shepherding and strength and Micah 2 says is

473
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.800
going to come the Micah 5 says is going to come Jesus says

474
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.500
I'm here.

475
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.200
I am this Good Shepherd and

476
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.400
just listen, I'm gonna read a lot of that passage in Luke in John

477
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.300
10. Listen to what that means when he says he's the Good Shepherd

478
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:39.600
listen.

479
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.200
It says he knows his own and his own

480
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:43.800
know him.

481
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.900
He calls his Sheep by name and he

482
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.400
leads them out.

483
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.900
That's you and me if we're his.

484
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.300
He goes before them and they follow his

485
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:57.700
voice.

486
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.400
He stays when it gets hard.

487
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.700
And he lays his life down to give

488
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.300
his sheep Abundant Life.

489
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:12.600
church that

490
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.900
Is what it means to Shepherd in strength.

491
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.500
When Jesus says I am the Good Shepherd.

492
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.800
He's looking back to this picture in Micah 5 of shepherding his

493
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.700
strength. Jesus says I am the Good Shepherd, but don't think

494
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.800
it's something different. Here's what it means. Jesus says.

495
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.300
I'm gonna lead you I'm gonna know you I'm going to guide you

496
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.300
and be with you. I'm going to protect you. I'm going

497
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:38.600
to

498
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.400
die for you

499
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.700
that is shepherding in strength. It's not arrogant. It's

500
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.800
not domineering.

501
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.800
It's humble sacrificial leadership.

502
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.700
That's what it means to Shepherd in Bible terms.

503
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.700
But here's what we can get to with that.

504
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.700
We can think that that means

505
00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:05.800
it's soft.

506
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.700
It's weak.

507
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.500
Right that that means are you shepherding? You're just gonna sit around on rocks

508
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.200
and talk about Theology and have a good time together.

509
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.600
Right, that's not the only idea of shepherding.

510
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.900
It's not weak because Micah 5 verse 4.

511
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.500
Says the reason he can bring that security is because of

512
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.600
his great power.

513
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.000
Because he's great in power.

514
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.100
Listen to verse 4 again.

515
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.500
It says he shall stand and Shepherd his flock in the strength

516
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.200
of the Lord in the Majesty of the name the Lord

517
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.400
his God and they shall dwell secure for now.

518
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.400
He shall be great to the ends of the Earth.

519
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.400
Did you see the shepherding idea has with it

520
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.500
strength? We already saw that.

521
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.500
That means his foundation strong secure. His walls are

522
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.500
strong enough to hide in he has the strength needed

523
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.800
but then there's this idea. He's standing shepherding

524
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.000
in the Majesty of the Lord.

525
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.900
That word majesty means height or

526
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.600
imminence.

527
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.400
The idea is imagine a throne room

528
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.500
of a palace.

529
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.600
And the King's throne is elevated above everything else.

530
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.700
There's always steps up to it like every movie you watch every thing picture

531
00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.800
you there's always steps up to the throne. It's always elevated

532
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.800
above everything else. Why?

533
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.600
Because it's signifies strength and power

534
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.400
and authority.

535
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.700
That you should not dare come against the person sitting

536
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.300
on that throne.

537
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.400
They have the full power to do anything they

538
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:56.800
want to do.

539
00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.000
That's the idea here with this word majesty in

540
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.200
the Majesty's. He's shepherding in the Majesty The

541
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.700
Authority imminence power of

542
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.700
the Lord our God.

543
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.000
Not only that. There's this word great at the end of

544
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:14.500
verse 4.

545
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.300
It says the Messiah will be great to the ends of

546
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.400
the Earth that word great means. Yes, he's going to be famous. He's

547
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.400
gonna be glorious, of course, but the the idea

548
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.500
of the word great is that it brings

549
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.000
with it strength.

550
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.300
Think about that great mountain in chapter 4 that's

551
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.000
going to be elevated above all the other mountains. It's a great Mountain. It

552
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.900
doesn't mean it's just like awesome thumbs up. It's powerful.

553
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.200
And and the think about when the Magi from

554
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.400
the East came to see Jesus in chapter 4

555
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.500
it talked about the Nations will stream to this great

556
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.100
mountain, right?

557
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.700
This is a symbol of what's happening. Is that Jesus is

558
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.400
this one on the mountain who's raining

559
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.300
and the nations are beginning to stream to him.

560
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.300
Desire to hear who he is and what he says.

561
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.500
But he'll be great. It means strong and above

562
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.000
all the others and all of that fits together

563
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.600
to think about this Messiah that he is great in

564
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.500
power.

565
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.200
Nothing can stand against him. Nothing is stand

566
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.300
in opposition and last they can try but they will not

567
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.000
last our King will win the war in the end.

568
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.700
That's why we can dwell secure Church.

569
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.600
This is who our Messiah is we can dwell secure

570
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.700
that doesn't mean we won't go through hard times in this

571
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.400
life. And as we Face things now, but it

572
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.300
does mean we can trust him on the backside of this. There's

573
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.500
going to be glory.

574
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.300
That's what Psalm 144 verse 2 says that he

575
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.400
is my steadfast love and my Fortress.

576
00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.300
my stronghold

577
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.300
my deliverer

578
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.800
my shield in whom I take refuge.

579
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.700
Is he that for you?

580
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.600
Do you run to him whenever things get

581
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:13.800
hard?

582
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.300
Or do you run to anything else?

583
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.300
Is he your Refuge?

584
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.400
He is powerful. So run and rest.

585
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:28.800
in him

586
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.200
But there's one more aspect of this Messiah that we need to see today.

587
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.300
It's the very first phrase of chapter of

588
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.100
verse 5.

589
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.800
And it's a simple phrase It's just says and he

590
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.300
shall be their peace.

591
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.500
He shall be.

592
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.200
their peace

593
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.500
this Messiah deliver

594
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.400
this Savior King that they were waiting for

595
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.100
that we get the picture of here. Not only will he

596
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.700
give his people peace. He is

597
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.100
their peace. He will be their peace.

598
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.500
Because think about what we've just seen about this Messiah.

599
00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.200
He is King.

600
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.500
He has eternal power. He has strength he has Authority he

601
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.500
has Majesty. He has Greatness by virtue of

602
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.200
all of that. He is our peace.

603
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.400
In fact, that's how Isaiah frames it in Isaiah 9

604
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.600
verses 6 and 7.

605
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.400
Listen to this he says for to us a child

606
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.000
is born to us a son is given.

607
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.800
And the government shall be upon his shoulder and

608
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.500
his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor, Mighty

609
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.100
God Everlasting father Prince

610
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.900
of Peace.

611
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.500
Of the increase of his government and of Peace

612
00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.000
there shall be no end.

613
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.500
On the throne of David and over his kingdom to establish

614
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.300
it to uphold it with Justice with righteousness from

615
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.400
this time forth and forevermore. The Zeal

616
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.100
or power of the Lord of hosts will do this.

617
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.900
So this ruler it's talking about.

618
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.200
That both Isaiah said Micah said

619
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.600
this ruler will have an ever-increasing eternal

620
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600
Kingdom.

621
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.600
That's full of justice and righteousness and

622
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.100
peace.

623
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.900
Why because he's the Prince of Peace?

624
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.200
If if the Prince of Peace is in charge of the Kingdom,

625
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.300
what do you think is going to be evident in the Kingdom?

626
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.000
Peace is going to rain.

627
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.500
He is the Prince of Peace. So he is going to bring peace

628
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.200
and be peace for us and man. We

629
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.300
look forward to that day. Don't we?

630
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.300
when we see Strife in Nations

631
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.500
she Strife politically in her own Nation.

632
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.300
We see divisions in our

633
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:07.700
own families.

634
00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.300
We long for the Prince of Peace that

635
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.300
one day. There will be peace on Earth as there is in heaven

636
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.200
already when the Messiah returns when he

637
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.200
comes and fully and finally Reigns on

638
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.400
the earth. He will bring peace across the

639
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.400
board as he is this Messiah King.

640
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.100
And the reality is that as we live out these principles daily these

641
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.400
Kingdom ideas. We see peace show

642
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.200
up more in our lives.

643
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.700
But listen, here's the most important way.

644
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.400
For you and me to experience peace today.

645
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.800
Is that we have peace with God through Christ.

646
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:52.800
right now

647
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.300
not just Pete like well how good what good is

648
00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:58.500
it?

649
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.400
If we have no war no family Strife no issues in

650
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.100
the world and yet we don't have peace with God what good is that all?

651
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.600
Romans 5:1 says if we have been justified by

652
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.200
faith, we have peace with God through our

653
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.000
Lord Jesus Christ.

654
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.400
Remember what the angel said when they announced the birth

655
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.500
of Jesus to the Shepherds?

656
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.600
They appeared in the sky scared these guys to death, but they they

657
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.300
said something to them. They said glory to God in

658
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.200
the highest and on Earth peace among those

659
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.300
with whom he's pleased.

660
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.000
The Prince of Peace is coming.

661
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.700
Being born in Bethlehem. So come see

662
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.500
Glory to God in the highest but think about that if if

663
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.200
he came to bring peace and his his heart is to

664
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.100
create peace with God through Jesus Christ, if if

665
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.100
that's the truth and we would only

666
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.100
need to find peace with

667
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.500
God if we were at once at war with God,

668
00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:58.700
right?

669
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.200
It you can't fix a problem. That's not

670
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.500
there. You can't bring peace to something if there's not enmity if

671
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.100
there's Not War.

672
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.500
If there's not Division, and so if we need peace with

673
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.900
God then we were at one time and are

674
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.300
in some cases at war with

675
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:17.500
God.

676
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.700
We're enemies in our sin.

677
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.200
with God

678
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.900
But that's what makes the good news truly good, right?

679
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.600
It's like Ephesians Romans 5:10 says while we were enemies. We

680
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.900
were reconciled to God by the death of his son.

681
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.100
Like we didn't even deserve this.

682
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.200
He looked across that battle line. So to speak

683
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.400
right you have that line between two warring armies.

684
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.100
He looked across there and he said no

685
00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.300
you're coming with me.

686
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.300
You're my enemy and yet I love you enough to

687
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.300
pluck you out and pull you to my side

688
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.000
while we were enemies. We were reconciled to God by the death

689
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:07.000
of his son. That only happens through faith. It doesn't mean he just randomly chooses

690
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.300
people and you have nothing in part of

691
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.400
that like he says by faith.

692
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.200
Which means you're going to acknowledge that you're going to know that

693
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.400
he's calling you you're going to respond to his life death and

694
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.800
Resurrection in your place. You're gonna say Jesus you're Perfection counts

695
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.800
for mine your death counts for mine your Resurrection

696
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.500
counts for mine. That's what brings peace

697
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.200
with God Church.

698
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.400
Because the one who knew no sin.

699
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.200
Became sin on your behalf.

700
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.900
So that you might in him become the righteousness of God.

701
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.300
To give us peace with God to reconcile us

702
00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.500
back to God. That's the gospel.

703
00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.400
That's the hope we have the power of God for the

704
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.400
Salvation those who believe.

705
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.300
For those who place their faith in that Messiah.

706
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.200
The deliverer we've been promised.

707
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.300
Because here's what Romans 5:11 says that should lead

708
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.300
us to it says it should lead us to rejoicing.

709
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.400
Should lead us that we rejoice in God through

710
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.000
our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we've received reconciliation.

711
00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.400
I mean just think.

712
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.500
About to know to know that you as an

713
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.300
enemy of God.

714
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.900
Due to your sin have now been reconciled back

715
00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.300
to him through the Messiah. What

716
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.400
joy that brings right?

717
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.300
That your eternity is secure in

718
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.100
him.

719
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.200
Not because you have a hold on him. It's because he's

720
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.400
holding on to you. He's done it all he's accomplished the

721
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.600
task. He's paid the price. That's the hope and joy

722
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.700
we get that's what Israel was longing for.

723
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.400
When Micah preaches this message to them.

724
00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.800
They're like give me some of that.

725
00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.800
I want that whoever that guy is that Messiah Bring

726
00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.100
It On.

727
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.800
I want that.

728
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.600
They were Longing For What Isaiah? 7:14 said would

729
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.100
come with the Messiah they longed for therefore.

730
00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.400
The Lord himself will give you a sign the Virgin

731
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.200
shall conceive and bear a son and shall call

732
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.000
his name Emmanuel.

733
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.200
That word Emmanuel or Emanuel whichever way

734
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.600
you want to spell that. It means god with us.

735
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.200
It means god with us. They were longing for

736
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.300
the restoration of their land for them to be a nation

737
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.300
again with God as their King that he would come back

738
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.300
and Reign again, like he should then in a sense. We're still

739
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.500
waiting as well. Right? We're waiting for Emmanuel God In

740
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.600
the Flesh to come back and return and Reign fully

741
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.400
on Earth this Messiah to come back once and

742
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.400
for all we're longing for that as well.

743
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.100
But here's the difference.

744
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.300
We have something they didn't have.

745
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.400
What They Knew by faith we know by name

746
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.200
And that name is Jesus that name is this promised

747
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.700
messiah's name is Jesus Christ,

748
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.300
Jesus Messiah. He's the the John

749
00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.300
1 Word become flesh who came and

750
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.300
dwelt among us. We've seen his glory glory is

751
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.300
the only son from the only father. That's what we have seen and

752
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.400
know and yeah, we're in Lexile right now. He's left us

753
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.200
for a little while and we struggle through that,

754
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.500
but we don't wait without hope

755
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.100
We don't wait without these glimmers of Light breaking

756
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.100
through the darkness.

757
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.000
That we see and know.

758
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.000
That because one thing he did.

759
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.100
while he was on Earth

760
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.700
paid the full penalty for our sin.

761
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.500
He made a way for us to be redeemed and reconciled back

762
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.300
to God. That's the one thing we know that they didn't know was coming.

763
00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.600
We look back and we see that we are secure

764
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.900
forever in that Messiah.

765
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.400
That is why we can say that every day is Christmas Day.

766
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.500
because when this Messiah came

767
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.800
Not just we hope he does come someday when he came.

768
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.400
He fully did everything

769
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:15.900
needed.

770
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.300
To reconcile us back to God.

771
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.800
And one day he's coming back.

772
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.300
To set up his kingdom fully and finally hear on

773
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.400
Earth. And so when we look at all of that picture about who

774
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.100
this Messiah is, what should we do? We should rejoice

775
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.600
Christmas is every day of Our Lives because

776
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.500
that that Messiah has come.

777
00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800
And we rejoice.

778
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.100
If by faith your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life

779
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.200
in heaven rejoice.

780
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.800
and rejoice

781
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.200
that your Messiah King is going to come back

782
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.700
one day and take you home with him.
