1
00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:19.285
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:22.765
What a morning. It has been already in 15 minutes.

3
00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:27.965
I mean, we just get such a, a joy to see what God is doing.

4
00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:29.925
It's an honor to be a part of, just to kind of sit back

5
00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:33.005
and watch and see, uh, what God is doing among us.

6
00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:34.085
It's awesome. And

7
00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:36.045
so if you are new to our church, my name's John.

8
00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:37.205
I'm one of the pastors here.

9
00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:39.765
If I have not had the privilege of meeting you yet,

10
00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:41.725
I would love to, uh, after the service,

11
00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.045
before the service sometime

12
00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:44.285
during the week, we'd love to do that.

13
00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.405
Uh, please come say hello.

14
00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:48.405
As we get into God's word today though,

15
00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:49.525
I wanna ask a question.

16
00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:51.205
Uh, start with this.

17
00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:56.085
Have you ever been tempted to take revenge on someone?

18
00:00:57.425 --> 00:00:59.565
Uh, if you have raise your hand, like, uh,

19
00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:01.005
I might see my hands up, right?

20
00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:03.485
So, uh, if you are not raising your hand,

21
00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:06.805
I'm probably gonna ask you if you're lying about that, okay?

22
00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:10.085
Uh, so it's okay to be honest here, right? We can do that.

23
00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:13.165
All of us, all of us have been tempted

24
00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:15.125
to take revenge.

25
00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:17.775
It's almost innate to us.

26
00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:19.775
Like even from a very young age,

27
00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:22.535
when you think about like the playground picture, right?

28
00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:24.575
One kid throws a punch. What's gonna happen next?

29
00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:26.295
That kid's throwing a punch back, right?

30
00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.175
It's just gonna happen. That's how it works.

31
00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.735
And in, in, in many ways, we have to learn as we get older

32
00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:34.815
how to control those reactions.

33
00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:37.255
So we don't just throw hands on the playground all the time.

34
00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:40.255
We've gotta figure out how to control that action.

35
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.575
But here's the thing about that.

36
00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:46.495
Sometimes it's not just about the action, right?

37
00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:51.935
It takes something supernatural to get that desire,

38
00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:54.095
not merely out of our actions,

39
00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:58.415
but to get that desire out of our hearts, to get that desire

40
00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:01.095
for revenge out of the deepest part of us.

41
00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:02.615
Because it still shows up, doesn't it?

42
00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:04.695
Even if we don't throw hands on the playground,

43
00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:06.055
we still see it in here.

44
00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:10.255
You get that less than stellar job performance review

45
00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:13.655
and you, you're tempted to slander or gossip about your boss

46
00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:18.035
or someone badmouth you on social media.

47
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:19.155
And so you're tempted at school

48
00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:21.075
to trip 'em in the hallway just to make him laugh

49
00:02:21.255 --> 00:02:22.595
and make people laugh at him, right?

50
00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:26.365
Or that person steals money from you

51
00:02:26.365 --> 00:02:28.765
and you're tempted to just drop the hammer legally.

52
00:02:32.595 --> 00:02:35.135
Or even your spouse annoys you in some way.

53
00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:36.855
And so you feel like this, I'm gonna silent

54
00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:37.935
treatment, that kind of thing.

55
00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:42.735
And this vengeful right? And on and on we could go.

56
00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:44.135
It's not just about those things, it's about

57
00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:46.415
so many other things because of our sinful flesh.

58
00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:51.375
That desire for vengeance is deep in our hearts, all of us.

59
00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:56.455
So what's the answer? What do we do with that?

60
00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:00.325
Well, let's see what God's word says

61
00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:02.445
starting in one Samuel Chapter

62
00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:05.925
24, 1 Samuel 24.

63
00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:08.125
As we continue the series through this book,

64
00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:12.445
nearing the end, we'll come into a couple weeks from now.

65
00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:14.885
We'll hit the end of it. But I just wanna read the first

66
00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:18.285
seven verses of one Samuel 24 to start.

67
00:03:18.355 --> 00:03:19.365
It's gonna set the context.

68
00:03:19.635 --> 00:03:23.525
It's very quick moving pace of this start.

69
00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:26.925
It's gonna set the context for everything else though

70
00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:29.885
as you'll see the rest of today.

71
00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:32.605
So first Samuel of 24, just the first seven verses,

72
00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:38.205
When Saul returned from following the Philistines,

73
00:03:38.445 --> 00:03:41.845
remember he had been distracted from chasing David by going

74
00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:43.165
to have to fight the Philistines.

75
00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.885
He returned, meaning he came back to the fight he was told,

76
00:03:47.145 --> 00:03:49.005
behold David's in the wilderness of in Getti.

77
00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:53.205
Then Saul took 3000 chosen men out of all of Israel

78
00:03:53.205 --> 00:03:54.205
and went to seek David

79
00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:56.325
and his men in front of the wild goats rocks.

80
00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:58.885
And he came to the sheep folds, by the way,

81
00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:02.885
where there was a cave and Saul went into relieve himself.

82
00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:05.285
That means what you think it does.

83
00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:07.805
So just we're not gonna talk about that again. Okay?

84
00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:09.445
Now, David

85
00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:12.325
and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave

86
00:04:13.145 --> 00:04:16.045
and the men of David said to him, here's the day

87
00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:17.205
of which the Lord said to you.

88
00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:19.525
Behold, I'll give your enemy into your hand.

89
00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:22.165
You shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.

90
00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:26.755
So David arose and stealthily cut off a

91
00:04:26.755 --> 00:04:28.315
corner of Saul's robe.

92
00:04:29.765 --> 00:04:31.465
And afterward David's heart struck him

93
00:04:31.615 --> 00:04:34.265
because he had cut off a corner of Saul's robe.

94
00:04:35.285 --> 00:04:37.305
He said to his men, the Lord forbid

95
00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:39.225
that I should do this thing to my Lord.

96
00:04:39.525 --> 00:04:42.945
The Lord's anointed to put out my hand against him,

97
00:04:42.945 --> 00:04:44.625
seeing he is the Lord's anointed.

98
00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:49.425
And so David persuaded strongly, his men with these words

99
00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:53.825
and did not permit them to attack Saul and Saul rose up

100
00:04:53.825 --> 00:04:55.825
and left the cave and went on his way.

101
00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:00.345
Now God, we know this is not the end of the chapter

102
00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:01.545
and there's a lot more left.

103
00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:04.225
But we pray this. We just get this picture, this framing

104
00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:07.305
of the scene that you have shown us

105
00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:10.145
so much already in these few verses.

106
00:05:10.475 --> 00:05:15.225
Teach us more, change our hearts more by virtue of

107
00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:17.865
what you've shown here and what you will teach us.

108
00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:20.545
Holy Spirit, this is your job to do that.

109
00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:23.105
Speak through your word

110
00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:25.585
into our hearts and give us eyes to see it.

111
00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:28.025
In Jesus' name, amen.

112
00:05:30.325 --> 00:05:31.825
Now the rest of the chapter, we'll get

113
00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:33.105
to a little bit later, it's full

114
00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:35.225
of really important dialogue between Saul and David.

115
00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:38.185
We'll get to that. But these first seven verses pretty much

116
00:05:38.185 --> 00:05:40.865
contained the whole of the story of this chapter.

117
00:05:42.295 --> 00:05:44.505
Saul was anointed by God as Israel's first king.

118
00:05:46.165 --> 00:05:49.465
He had lost that kingship effectively

119
00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:51.985
by denying God as his king.

120
00:05:52.725 --> 00:05:56.105
And so God anointed David as the replacement king.

121
00:05:56.885 --> 00:05:57.885
And so the tension is

122
00:05:57.885 --> 00:05:59.285
that they're both anointed at this point.

123
00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:03.645
But we see how God is, is shifting the leadership

124
00:06:03.645 --> 00:06:05.525
of the nation to David over time.

125
00:06:05.545 --> 00:06:08.245
But Saul is still effectively in that position

126
00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:11.605
and in his jealousy over losing it to David,

127
00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:14.245
he was seeking David's life, trying

128
00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:17.725
to eliminate David from the equation over and over and over.

129
00:06:17.985 --> 00:06:22.245
Yet we have seen God protected David from

130
00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:23.765
Saul repeatedly.

131
00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:28.305
But here's the question we haven't asked yet.

132
00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:31.465
Was Saul safe from David?

133
00:06:33.955 --> 00:06:36.545
David was safe from Saul. Saul couldn't even find him.

134
00:06:37.725 --> 00:06:41.985
But was Saul safe from David? That's the question.

135
00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.825
Chapter 24 begins to answer.

136
00:06:45.435 --> 00:06:47.025
David comes into prominence.

137
00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:48.785
How would he respond to the fact

138
00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:51.105
that Saul is now less prominent

139
00:06:51.105 --> 00:06:55.465
and David has opportunities like Saul has had opportunities?

140
00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:01.245
Well, here's what we learned right away is that David's men

141
00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:04.965
wanted power by force, right?

142
00:07:04.965 --> 00:07:08.765
We saw that David's men for sure at least,

143
00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:10.365
they wanted power by force.

144
00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:15.695
See, Saul is on the hunt for David

145
00:07:15.715 --> 00:07:17.735
and this is just west of the dead Sea.

146
00:07:18.235 --> 00:07:20.655
Uh, it's in the middle of nowhere. It's a wilderness.

147
00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:22.095
It's really harsh conditions.

148
00:07:22.515 --> 00:07:25.935
And so Saul ended up in one of these caves in the area

149
00:07:26.325 --> 00:07:28.295
that dot that whole area.

150
00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:29.695
If you've ever been able to be over there,

151
00:07:29.695 --> 00:07:30.975
it's incredible to see it.

152
00:07:32.395 --> 00:07:35.135
And it just happened to be the cave that David

153
00:07:35.195 --> 00:07:36.615
and his men were hiding in.

154
00:07:38.835 --> 00:07:41.535
Now, David's men read the situation

155
00:07:41.555 --> 00:07:43.575
and they saw this as God's providence,

156
00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:48.215
that God would deliver Saul into David's hand

157
00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:50.575
to finally rid himself of this

158
00:07:51.135 --> 00:07:53.375
constant death threat against David's life.

159
00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:57.965
He's got an opportunity. That's why they said

160
00:07:58.155 --> 00:07:59.605
what they said in verse four.

161
00:07:59.635 --> 00:08:04.455
Look again. Here is the day of which the Lord said to you.

162
00:08:04.635 --> 00:08:06.255
Behold, I'll give your enemy into your hand.

163
00:08:06.255 --> 00:08:08.855
You shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.

164
00:08:10.245 --> 00:08:12.295
Like they, they looked at the situation.

165
00:08:12.295 --> 00:08:14.455
That's the way they were certain

166
00:08:14.685 --> 00:08:16.695
that they read the situation correctly.

167
00:08:16.885 --> 00:08:21.855
This was God's will to free them from this threat.

168
00:08:25.355 --> 00:08:29.105
Was it though, because David had a

169
00:08:29.105 --> 00:08:30.265
different interpretation, right?

170
00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.535
Even though he had every clear opportunity

171
00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:39.135
to take Saul's life in that cave, he merely cut off a part

172
00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:40.455
of Saul's robe.

173
00:08:43.105 --> 00:08:44.885
Now, to us, that's not that big a deal,

174
00:08:45.745 --> 00:08:48.235
like just a little piece of fabric.

175
00:08:48.455 --> 00:08:52.635
But, but many believe that it more

176
00:08:53.745 --> 00:08:55.885
than just David showing Saul

177
00:08:55.885 --> 00:08:57.405
that I could have killed you and I didn't.

178
00:08:57.555 --> 00:09:00.765
That it meant more that it actually alludes back

179
00:09:00.765 --> 00:09:04.605
to chapter 15 when Saul and was with Samuel and,

180
00:09:04.605 --> 00:09:08.005
and Samuel told Saul that God was taking the kingdom away.

181
00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:10.005
And Saul grabbed his robe and it tore

182
00:09:10.345 --> 00:09:12.085
and Samuel said, Hey, that's

183
00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:13.365
what God's doing with the kingdom.

184
00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:16.845
He's tearing it away from you that this in some way

185
00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:19.365
alludes back to that moment.

186
00:09:19.805 --> 00:09:21.725
'cause that robe that Saul was wearing,

187
00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:23.685
it was a symbol of the kingship.

188
00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:26.845
It it was something that showed

189
00:09:26.915 --> 00:09:28.245
that he was the only one who could wear it.

190
00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:31.685
It was probably had some nice fringes on the edge of it.

191
00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:34.565
That was the way often those kings looked at the time.

192
00:09:34.585 --> 00:09:37.125
And that's why I think David was so convicted

193
00:09:37.385 --> 00:09:38.605
by this act that he did.

194
00:09:40.655 --> 00:09:43.085
Verse five, it says David's heart struck him

195
00:09:43.085 --> 00:09:44.245
because of what he had done.

196
00:09:45.465 --> 00:09:50.215
Why? Because David cutting off the corner

197
00:09:50.675 --> 00:09:53.735
of the robe could have been construed

198
00:09:53.965 --> 00:09:58.175
that it was a symbolic effort to take the kingship by force.

199
00:10:00.915 --> 00:10:04.525
That he says the robe is mine in a sense

200
00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:07.325
that he was pushing Saul off the throne

201
00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:09.285
and taking this position himself.

202
00:10:11.755 --> 00:10:12.935
That's the way it could have.

203
00:10:12.955 --> 00:10:14.815
And I think that's why David was really like, oh,

204
00:10:14.895 --> 00:10:17.815
I shouldn't have done that because that's

205
00:10:17.815 --> 00:10:19.255
what people would've read into it.

206
00:10:19.315 --> 00:10:22.055
And so what we learn again is David was sensitive

207
00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:24.455
to God's work in his heart.

208
00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:28.375
He's continuing to prove himself more and more worthy.

209
00:10:28.405 --> 00:10:29.855
He's growing in his trust

210
00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:31.615
that the Lord's gonna work all this out.

211
00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:34.895
And so he's settling into that reality.

212
00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:37.495
That's why we see verse six as an example.

213
00:10:37.495 --> 00:10:39.175
Look at what David said in verse six.

214
00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:45.955
He said, the Lord, Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing

215
00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:48.635
to my Lord little L.

216
00:10:49.145 --> 00:10:52.035
He's talking about his Lord the king Saul.

217
00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:54.755
He's still respectful of the position

218
00:10:56.175 --> 00:10:57.715
he calls Saul the Lord.

219
00:10:57.955 --> 00:10:59.195
Yahweh's anointed.

220
00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:02.195
Lord forbid that I should do this

221
00:11:02.455 --> 00:11:03.755
to put out my hand against him,

222
00:11:04.135 --> 00:11:06.115
seeing he is the Lord's anointed.

223
00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:10.115
Again, David respected, understood.

224
00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:14.155
His fear of the Lord was bigger than his fear of Saul.

225
00:11:15.325 --> 00:11:16.875
We'll see even more later as we get

226
00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:18.995
to the dialogue later in the chapter.

227
00:11:19.055 --> 00:11:22.915
But David knew again, Saul had been anointed by God as well.

228
00:11:25.095 --> 00:11:26.865
Even though Saul was shown his true colors,

229
00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:27.945
he was trying to kill David.

230
00:11:28.005 --> 00:11:30.705
He was showing he wasn't truly following the Lord.

231
00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:34.585
But David feared God enough not to take Saul's life.

232
00:11:36.265 --> 00:11:38.865
'cause the command was don't touch the Lord's anointed.

233
00:11:40.155 --> 00:11:43.455
And so David respected that, knew that feared God enough

234
00:11:43.455 --> 00:11:47.095
that even though it might have seemed providential,

235
00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:50.945
That God had provided Saul right in front of him

236
00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:53.245
to kill him, to take Saul out.

237
00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:56.085
David did not want to take revenge.

238
00:12:00.655 --> 00:12:03.835
So watch what happened next. Saul left the cave.

239
00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:05.795
Saul knew none of this had happened, right?

240
00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.355
He's le he he left.

241
00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:10.075
He doesn't even notice his robe is a little shorter.

242
00:12:10.095 --> 00:12:14.645
He doesn't know any of that. Watch now verses eight

243
00:12:14.645 --> 00:12:16.925
through 22, and again this is just dialogue

244
00:12:16.925 --> 00:12:18.005
between Saul and David.

245
00:12:18.045 --> 00:12:19.405
Everything's happened already,

246
00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:23.045
but now we see how it plays out.

247
00:12:23.295 --> 00:12:28.075
Verse eight afterward, David also arose

248
00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:30.715
and went outta the cave and he called after Saul.

249
00:12:30.775 --> 00:12:32.075
Now let's just stop for a second.

250
00:12:32.395 --> 00:12:35.515
Remember, David knew Saul was hunting him.

251
00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:37.155
David knew Saul could never find him.

252
00:12:37.255 --> 00:12:38.395
And now he's coming outta the cave

253
00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:39.475
and saying, Hey Saul, I'm here.

254
00:12:39.685 --> 00:12:44.075
Right? Like that's a bit of a risk, but you see his heart.

255
00:12:44.575 --> 00:12:45.835
So he went outta the cave. He called

256
00:12:45.835 --> 00:12:47.355
after Saul, my Lord the king.

257
00:12:48.425 --> 00:12:51.155
When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face

258
00:12:51.255 --> 00:12:52.555
to the earth and pay Domage.

259
00:12:53.255 --> 00:12:56.675
And David said to Saul, why do you listen to the words

260
00:12:56.695 --> 00:12:59.875
of men who say, behold, David seeks your harm.

261
00:13:00.735 --> 00:13:02.915
Behold, this day, your eyes have seen

262
00:13:02.935 --> 00:13:06.075
how the Lord gave you today into my hand in the cave.

263
00:13:07.105 --> 00:13:10.115
Some told me to kill you, but I spared you.

264
00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:13.635
I said, I will not put out my hand against my Lord

265
00:13:13.655 --> 00:13:15.275
for he is the Lord's anointed.

266
00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:21.355
See my Father, see the corner of your robe in my hand for

267
00:13:21.355 --> 00:13:22.675
by the fact that I cut off the corner

268
00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:24.035
of your robe and did not kill you.

269
00:13:24.735 --> 00:13:26.955
You may know and see that there's no wrong

270
00:13:27.055 --> 00:13:28.555
or treason in my hands.

271
00:13:29.635 --> 00:13:30.955
I have not sinned against you,

272
00:13:31.135 --> 00:13:33.275
though you hunt my life to take it.

273
00:13:34.775 --> 00:13:36.555
May the Lord judge between me and you.

274
00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:39.555
May the Lord avenge me against you,

275
00:13:39.895 --> 00:13:42.155
but my hand shall not be against you.

276
00:13:43.545 --> 00:13:45.405
As the proverb of the ancients says,

277
00:13:45.405 --> 00:13:46.925
outta the wicked comes wickedness.

278
00:13:47.385 --> 00:13:49.205
But my hand shall not be against you.

279
00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:50.885
After whom has the King

280
00:13:50.885 --> 00:13:53.245
of Israel come out After whom do you pursue

281
00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:57.565
after a dead dog, after a flea, may the Lord

282
00:13:57.565 --> 00:14:00.405
therefore be judged and give sentence between me and you

283
00:14:00.825 --> 00:14:02.405
and see to it and plead my cause

284
00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:03.645
and deliver me from your hand.

285
00:14:05.615 --> 00:14:08.315
As soon as David is finished speaking these words to Saul,

286
00:14:08.425 --> 00:14:10.355
Saul said, is this your voice?

287
00:14:10.575 --> 00:14:14.035
My son David Saul lifted up his voice and wept

288
00:14:14.035 --> 00:14:17.155
and said to David, you are more righteous than I

289
00:14:18.095 --> 00:14:19.675
for you have repaid me good.

290
00:14:19.705 --> 00:14:21.915
Whereas I have repaid you evil

291
00:14:23.015 --> 00:14:26.075
and you've declared this day how you have dealt well with me

292
00:14:26.455 --> 00:14:27.595
and that you did not kill me.

293
00:14:27.595 --> 00:14:28.875
When the Lord put me into your hands

294
00:14:30.015 --> 00:14:32.635
for if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe?

295
00:14:34.365 --> 00:14:36.265
So may the Lord reward you with good for

296
00:14:36.265 --> 00:14:37.385
what you've done to me this day.

297
00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:41.385
Now behold, I know that you shall surely be king.

298
00:14:42.485 --> 00:14:45.025
The kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.

299
00:14:46.035 --> 00:14:47.465
Swear to me, therefore, by the Lord

300
00:14:47.465 --> 00:14:49.185
that you will not cut off my offspring

301
00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:51.565
after me, that you will not destroy my name

302
00:14:51.565 --> 00:14:52.725
outta my father's house.

303
00:14:53.415 --> 00:14:54.805
David swore this to Saul.

304
00:14:54.805 --> 00:14:56.325
And Saul went home, but David

305
00:14:56.385 --> 00:14:58.005
and his men went up to the stronghold.

306
00:15:00.865 --> 00:15:04.085
Now, if you remember from previous chapters,

307
00:15:04.085 --> 00:15:05.165
you remember there were be there.

308
00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:08.005
There were bunches of people who were feeding Saul the lie

309
00:15:08.035 --> 00:15:09.085
that David was

310
00:15:09.165 --> 00:15:13.775
after him too, that he better take out David

311
00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:15.215
first or David's gonna kill him,

312
00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:19.905
which was partly the reason David did this here.

313
00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:24.745
He attempted peace by persuasion, by trying

314
00:15:24.765 --> 00:15:27.425
to persuade Saul to change his mind.

315
00:15:29.565 --> 00:15:31.905
He attempted peace by persuasion.

316
00:15:31.925 --> 00:15:33.905
He knew people were feeding Saul the lie.

317
00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:35.705
So he's like, Hey Saul, let me show you.

318
00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:37.905
Lemme try to persuade you. That's not true.

319
00:15:38.045 --> 00:15:41.105
And there was a masterclass given by David right here.

320
00:15:42.205 --> 00:15:44.065
How he goes about this is just phenomenal.

321
00:15:44.095 --> 00:15:45.625
He's proving to to Saul

322
00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:47.625
that there's no a vengeance in David's heart

323
00:15:47.885 --> 00:15:49.865
or else Saul would've been dead by now

324
00:15:52.025 --> 00:15:53.165
and watch how he did this.

325
00:15:53.615 --> 00:15:56.125
Watch how David handled this situation in in verse eight.

326
00:15:56.125 --> 00:16:00.525
It shows his posture even was a humble posture, bowing low

327
00:16:00.545 --> 00:16:01.685
before Saul.

328
00:16:01.685 --> 00:16:02.965
He was not coming in arrogance.

329
00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:07.885
He asked Saul to consider the facts of the situation

330
00:16:10.245 --> 00:16:11.325
compared to what Saul had heard.

331
00:16:11.505 --> 00:16:13.645
Here's what actually happened today, Saul.

332
00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:18.725
It doesn't match, right? David even appealed to scripture

333
00:16:18.905 --> 00:16:20.805
as part of his defense saying that,

334
00:16:20.825 --> 00:16:22.325
Hey Saul, you believe this too?

335
00:16:22.325 --> 00:16:24.205
Like don't you see this is

336
00:16:24.205 --> 00:16:25.805
what I would've done if I was wicked.

337
00:16:27.575 --> 00:16:30.235
And David ultimately entrusted the whole situation

338
00:16:30.235 --> 00:16:32.355
to the Lord as the judge between them.

339
00:16:34.885 --> 00:16:36.185
Now here's what's interesting about this.

340
00:16:36.725 --> 00:16:38.585
The way Saul responded to David.

341
00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:42.545
It seemed to work like what David tried to do here.

342
00:16:43.455 --> 00:16:48.385
Saul was almost seeming to agree. Look at verse 17 again.

343
00:16:49.805 --> 00:16:51.705
He said to David, you're more righteous than I.

344
00:16:51.705 --> 00:16:53.665
You've repaid me good. I've repaid you evil.

345
00:16:54.605 --> 00:16:56.785
You've declared how you've dealt well with me.

346
00:16:56.885 --> 00:17:00.965
You didn't kill me Like verse 20.

347
00:17:01.025 --> 00:17:03.125
He even agrees, I know you shall be surely king.

348
00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:05.365
The kingdom of Israel shall be established.

349
00:17:05.495 --> 00:17:07.645
Swear that you won't cut me off.

350
00:17:07.645 --> 00:17:09.925
Like that sounds like a defeated man.

351
00:17:10.945 --> 00:17:13.725
Sounds like a repentant heart, doesn't it?

352
00:17:15.385 --> 00:17:19.955
And again, if we only take this chapter that might be true,

353
00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:24.235
we might see, oh yeah, Saul leaves lets him go

354
00:17:24.575 --> 00:17:27.595
and David leaves and everything is good again.

355
00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:30.875
But we can't take just this chapter

356
00:17:33.045 --> 00:17:34.935
like we can't take just this chapter.

357
00:17:34.995 --> 00:17:36.455
We don't read in isolation.

358
00:17:36.675 --> 00:17:41.255
See, Saul actually continued to seek David's life

359
00:17:41.985 --> 00:17:43.815
throughout the rest of the book.

360
00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:48.375
Saul knew what he said to David was true.

361
00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:52.965
And look how far he had fallen. He knew this was wrong.

362
00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:56.965
He knew David was to be the king and Saul kept after him.

363
00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:06.085
Now, as we consider the chapter

364
00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:09.245
as a whole, the facts

365
00:18:09.245 --> 00:18:10.645
of the situation are pretty straightforward,

366
00:18:10.645 --> 00:18:12.165
pretty simple to understand, right?

367
00:18:12.305 --> 00:18:14.285
We, we've heard this story probably before.

368
00:18:15.145 --> 00:18:17.045
We can clearly grasp what David did here.

369
00:18:17.105 --> 00:18:18.965
He did the right thing, he didn't,

370
00:18:19.505 --> 00:18:20.965
you can see it pretty clearly.

371
00:18:21.265 --> 00:18:24.365
But we need to ask a couple questions of it

372
00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:27.895
and really ask a couple questions of ourselves

373
00:18:28.795 --> 00:18:29.895
in light of it.

374
00:18:32.255 --> 00:18:34.475
So I just want you to, I started with this a little bit.

375
00:18:34.515 --> 00:18:35.875
I want you to play this out in your head.

376
00:18:35.955 --> 00:18:38.915
I, I think put yourself in this situation.

377
00:18:40.655 --> 00:18:43.075
So there's a man who is committing all

378
00:18:43.075 --> 00:18:45.755
of his resources toward taking your life.

379
00:18:48.425 --> 00:18:51.645
It puts you on the run. It upends everything in your life.

380
00:18:52.025 --> 00:18:56.455
You can't live in any normalcy. He's after you.

381
00:18:56.475 --> 00:18:58.815
But then all of a sudden, that man ends

382
00:18:58.815 --> 00:18:59.855
up right in front of you.

383
00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:02.415
He doesn't know you're there. He's right in front of you.

384
00:19:02.635 --> 00:19:04.695
And everyone around you is telling you

385
00:19:04.765 --> 00:19:07.015
that God put him there so

386
00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:10.095
that you can end this battle once and for all.

387
00:19:10.565 --> 00:19:14.255
What would you do? You ever seen that TV show

388
00:19:14.255 --> 00:19:16.335
that talks about this, puts you in a situation like

389
00:19:16.335 --> 00:19:17.615
what would you do in this situa?

390
00:19:18.565 --> 00:19:22.315
What would you do here? Would you

391
00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:24.755
take vengeance on Saul?

392
00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:27.635
Would you take Saul's life?

393
00:19:27.865 --> 00:19:30.995
He's been throwing spears at you, sending troops at you,

394
00:19:31.055 --> 00:19:33.275
trying to kill you over and over and over.

395
00:19:33.585 --> 00:19:34.795
He's right there in front of you.

396
00:19:35.055 --> 00:19:37.515
You have the opportunity to kill him. Would you?

397
00:19:42.675 --> 00:19:46.135
Now, I'm fully aware this is an extreme case.

398
00:19:47.675 --> 00:19:49.845
It's really hard to put ourselves in a situation like that.

399
00:19:50.165 --> 00:19:52.725
I hope none of us are ever in a situation like that before.

400
00:19:56.235 --> 00:20:01.215
But the reality is, every day you

401
00:20:01.215 --> 00:20:04.695
and I face similar temptations

402
00:20:05.755 --> 00:20:06.575
to take vengeance

403
00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:11.395
in a million other ways.

404
00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:16.595
We are tempted similarly, that's where this gets

405
00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:17.915
to the heart for us.

406
00:20:20.685 --> 00:20:22.185
See, here's the fundamental question.

407
00:20:23.525 --> 00:20:24.825
The fundamental question of all this.

408
00:20:25.255 --> 00:20:29.465
Will I trust God to fight my battles

409
00:20:31.085 --> 00:20:34.065
or will I try to take matters into my own hands?

410
00:20:36.095 --> 00:20:37.665
Will I trust God to fight the battle

411
00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:41.265
or will I take matters in my own hands?

412
00:20:41.685 --> 00:20:44.105
Do I think I have a right to revenge?

413
00:20:50.395 --> 00:20:52.575
Now next week, we'll see, David had some room

414
00:20:52.595 --> 00:20:57.215
to grow in this, but he passed the test here, didn't he?

415
00:20:58.955 --> 00:21:01.775
He, he's presented with an unexpected opportunity in the

416
00:21:01.805 --> 00:21:04.895
cave and it reveals that his heart was right.

417
00:21:05.155 --> 00:21:07.655
He really was a man after God's own heart.

418
00:21:07.655 --> 00:21:10.375
He didn't want to do anything that would hinder

419
00:21:10.905 --> 00:21:12.415
God's work through him.

420
00:21:14.295 --> 00:21:17.675
And we've said it the entire series, we've said it today.

421
00:21:18.095 --> 00:21:22.835
It all comes back to a person's trust in the Lord.

422
00:21:25.015 --> 00:21:26.795
Do we trust God in this or not?

423
00:21:27.505 --> 00:21:29.835
This is how David said it to Saul in verse 12.

424
00:21:30.195 --> 00:21:33.725
Remember this, May the Lord judge

425
00:21:33.755 --> 00:21:35.445
between me and you.

426
00:21:37.135 --> 00:21:39.515
May the Lord avenge me against you,

427
00:21:39.735 --> 00:21:42.555
but my hand shall not be against you.

428
00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:48.115
And then in verse 15, may the Lord be judged

429
00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:52.515
and give sentence between me and you and see to it

430
00:21:52.575 --> 00:21:56.795
and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand.

431
00:21:58.095 --> 00:22:01.955
You see that right? David trusted the Lord

432
00:22:02.055 --> 00:22:03.355
to resolve the situation.

433
00:22:04.575 --> 00:22:06.595
He could have taken matters into his own hands.

434
00:22:06.655 --> 00:22:08.395
He could have done it right there.

435
00:22:08.455 --> 00:22:11.795
But think about the potential consequences.

436
00:22:12.055 --> 00:22:16.975
If he would've done that, there probably would've been

437
00:22:17.005 --> 00:22:21.175
some who would've aligned around Jonathan as the next king.

438
00:22:22.455 --> 00:22:24.775
Jonathan was Saul's son. Next in line.

439
00:22:25.485 --> 00:22:27.775
Many people would've said, well, David did that.

440
00:22:27.915 --> 00:22:30.015
No, we're gonna, we're Jonathan's the one.

441
00:22:32.865 --> 00:22:35.205
People would not have trusted David as much

442
00:22:35.205 --> 00:22:36.485
because of what he did to Saul.

443
00:22:39.135 --> 00:22:41.105
Like if you're gonna take his life, we sure might.

444
00:22:41.105 --> 00:22:42.585
Well, you might take my life too. I don't know.

445
00:22:45.775 --> 00:22:47.795
He would've been disobeying the Lord's command

446
00:22:47.975 --> 00:22:51.235
and that would have led to God's discipline in his life,

447
00:22:51.285 --> 00:22:52.915
which would've been painful.

448
00:22:54.415 --> 00:22:57.715
So you can see all of these in, in spite

449
00:22:57.775 --> 00:23:01.235
of this apparent victory, he would have won oversaw.

450
00:23:03.505 --> 00:23:04.935
There would've been great deal of pain.

451
00:23:09.675 --> 00:23:11.265
Maybe some of you have been there, right?

452
00:23:14.575 --> 00:23:18.145
I've been there. Have you ever taken vengeance

453
00:23:18.145 --> 00:23:19.225
on someone who hurt you?

454
00:23:20.365 --> 00:23:22.065
And in the moment it felt really good.

455
00:23:22.455 --> 00:23:24.145
Like man, I got 'em.

456
00:23:26.685 --> 00:23:31.045
But then the pain came, the consequences came.

457
00:23:33.805 --> 00:23:35.705
It didn't really turn out the way you thought it would.

458
00:23:37.735 --> 00:23:39.295
Consequences came in your life.

459
00:23:39.315 --> 00:23:42.805
You never could have predicted all

460
00:23:42.805 --> 00:23:44.845
because of vengeance.

461
00:23:49.525 --> 00:23:54.105
Listen, that's why Romans 12 is so instructive for us today.

462
00:23:56.235 --> 00:24:00.965
Because if we are Christians, if you are a Christian,

463
00:24:04.505 --> 00:24:07.045
we ought to be different in this

464
00:24:10.745 --> 00:24:12.325
not only for other people's sake,

465
00:24:12.325 --> 00:24:16.125
that we don't hurt other people, but also for our own souls.

466
00:24:18.135 --> 00:24:20.845
We've got to be different in this.

467
00:24:23.715 --> 00:24:25.335
Now here's a little preview.

468
00:24:25.745 --> 00:24:27.895
After Easter, late April,

469
00:24:28.225 --> 00:24:30.695
we're gonna take a deep dive into Romans 12.

470
00:24:31.795 --> 00:24:35.575
The whole chapter, just spend weeks in that chapter

471
00:24:37.405 --> 00:24:40.535
because it shows us what it looks like

472
00:24:40.795 --> 00:24:45.165
to truly follow Jesus, to love him with all that we are

473
00:24:45.385 --> 00:24:48.485
and to live a life that looks like his.

474
00:24:52.215 --> 00:24:53.315
I'm really excited about that.

475
00:24:53.335 --> 00:24:55.195
But, but I wanna just show you a little glimpse

476
00:24:55.905 --> 00:24:59.275
with this topic today, what Romans 12 says

477
00:25:00.885 --> 00:25:02.595
about this issue.

478
00:25:03.735 --> 00:25:04.155
Listen,

479
00:25:08.915 --> 00:25:11.025
bless those who persecute you.

480
00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:14.405
Bless and do not curse them.

481
00:25:16.865 --> 00:25:19.025
Repay no one evil for evil.

482
00:25:19.885 --> 00:25:22.625
But give thought to do what is honorable in the sight

483
00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:24.865
of all if possible.

484
00:25:25.165 --> 00:25:27.985
So far as it depends on you live

485
00:25:28.815 --> 00:25:30.425
peaceably with all.

486
00:25:32.215 --> 00:25:34.305
Like is that not an incredible picture

487
00:25:34.685 --> 00:25:38.105
of a transformed life, of a transformed heart,

488
00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:39.265
of a different way of living?

489
00:25:39.565 --> 00:25:41.625
That's radical, right? It's the same way.

490
00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:42.945
Listen, this is not new.

491
00:25:43.135 --> 00:25:45.385
It's the same way Jesus said it in the Sermon on

492
00:25:45.385 --> 00:25:46.465
the Mount in Matthew five.

493
00:25:46.735 --> 00:25:47.905
He's talking about the way

494
00:25:47.905 --> 00:25:49.825
of the world versus the way of Christ.

495
00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:51.025
Listen to what he says.

496
00:25:51.285 --> 00:25:53.825
You've heard that it was said, an eye for an eye

497
00:25:53.825 --> 00:25:54.825
and a tooth for a tooth.

498
00:25:55.495 --> 00:25:57.945
Like that's the way of the world vengeance.

499
00:25:58.965 --> 00:26:00.025
Pay it back equal.

500
00:26:01.565 --> 00:26:04.905
But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil.

501
00:26:06.045 --> 00:26:07.625
But if anyone slaps you on the right

502
00:26:07.625 --> 00:26:08.985
cheek, turn to him the other.

503
00:26:09.095 --> 00:26:10.985
Also, if anyone would sue you

504
00:26:10.985 --> 00:26:13.465
and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.

505
00:26:14.125 --> 00:26:16.385
And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go

506
00:26:16.385 --> 00:26:18.945
with him two miles, give to the one who begs from you.

507
00:26:19.125 --> 00:26:22.025
Do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.

508
00:26:23.935 --> 00:26:28.345
Does that not sound so radical to our modern ears

509
00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:36.335
in a world dominated by vengeance,

510
00:26:36.755 --> 00:26:38.615
by giving someone what they deserve?

511
00:26:41.085 --> 00:26:45.465
This sounds crazy. They hurt me.

512
00:26:46.655 --> 00:26:50.175
They should get it. This, this sounds crazy,

513
00:26:51.875 --> 00:26:53.615
but it's the way of Christ, isn't it?

514
00:26:54.765 --> 00:26:56.135
This is Jesus himself.

515
00:26:56.285 --> 00:26:57.655
It's red letters in your Bible

516
00:26:57.715 --> 00:26:58.735
if you want to take that right?

517
00:26:58.765 --> 00:27:02.135
It's, it's Jesus saying this is the way it is.

518
00:27:02.205 --> 00:27:04.935
Like Romans 12 said, instead of cursing someone,

519
00:27:05.155 --> 00:27:06.015
you bless them

520
00:27:09.455 --> 00:27:10.625
someone who hurts you.

521
00:27:10.645 --> 00:27:11.865
You don't gossip about 'em,

522
00:27:11.865 --> 00:27:13.905
you don't slander them, you bless them.

523
00:27:17.825 --> 00:27:21.325
You never live the eye for an eye mantra of the world.

524
00:27:21.355 --> 00:27:23.445
Instead, you look to honor people, you look

525
00:27:23.445 --> 00:27:26.925
to build peace like David tried to do with Saul.

526
00:27:27.025 --> 00:27:28.525
You try to be a peacemaker

527
00:27:30.025 --> 00:27:34.515
and ultimately you leave your life.

528
00:27:34.615 --> 00:27:39.035
You entrust your life to the sovereign God of the universe.

529
00:27:41.145 --> 00:27:43.105
'cause Romans 12 continues with this.

530
00:27:45.095 --> 00:27:48.225
Beloved never avenge yourselves,

531
00:27:49.445 --> 00:27:52.065
but leave it to the wrath of God.

532
00:27:52.445 --> 00:27:55.185
For it is written. Vengeance is mine.

533
00:27:55.745 --> 00:27:57.385
I will repay, says the Lord.

534
00:27:59.945 --> 00:28:02.325
To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.

535
00:28:02.425 --> 00:28:05.405
If he's thirsty, give him something to drink for.

536
00:28:05.505 --> 00:28:08.565
By so doing, you will heat burning coals on his head.

537
00:28:09.345 --> 00:28:13.365
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

538
00:28:16.065 --> 00:28:19.695
Again, a life like that, a life lived like that, that

539
00:28:20.215 --> 00:28:22.175
evidences a transformed heart, doesn't it?

540
00:28:23.055 --> 00:28:24.615
'cause that's not natural to any of us.

541
00:28:24.915 --> 00:28:27.535
That's not going to happen just because we're humans.

542
00:28:27.835 --> 00:28:30.335
That's the opposite of what happens

543
00:28:30.335 --> 00:28:35.275
because we're humans Where

544
00:28:35.275 --> 00:28:36.635
you're not overcome by evil,

545
00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:39.035
but instead you overcome evil with good

546
00:28:41.335 --> 00:28:42.845
where you're not saturated

547
00:28:42.845 --> 00:28:45.085
with the vengeance the world promotes.

548
00:28:49.485 --> 00:28:53.335
Instead, you are so trusting in the Lord that you seek

549
00:28:53.555 --> 00:28:55.375
to do good to those who hurt you.

550
00:28:55.595 --> 00:28:58.055
You seek to forgive people when they hurt you.

551
00:28:58.315 --> 00:29:01.415
You love your enemies as Jesus commanded us to do.

552
00:29:04.835 --> 00:29:08.355
'cause David did that. And as he did that, Saul realized

553
00:29:08.465 --> 00:29:10.835
that David had something that Saul didn't have.

554
00:29:12.015 --> 00:29:15.155
He he saw something in in David that was different.

555
00:29:16.095 --> 00:29:18.875
He was a better man than he, Saul said,

556
00:29:20.365 --> 00:29:21.585
but we can't miss something else.

557
00:29:21.765 --> 00:29:25.265
We have to assume that what David did, as Romans 12 said,

558
00:29:25.485 --> 00:29:28.945
was just heaping burning coals on Saul's head

559
00:29:30.715 --> 00:29:33.645
that Saul could not get away from it.

560
00:29:33.645 --> 00:29:35.725
Which is maybe why Saul kept coming after him.

561
00:29:35.725 --> 00:29:38.125
He felt so convicted by David's life.

562
00:29:38.345 --> 00:29:40.805
He just felt so guilty over what he was doing to David.

563
00:29:40.985 --> 00:29:42.685
He just couldn't stop. And it made him kind

564
00:29:42.685 --> 00:29:45.975
of crazy either way.

565
00:29:45.975 --> 00:29:50.495
Here's the point. As Christians,

566
00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:56.095
instead of trying to gain power by force,

567
00:29:57.205 --> 00:30:00.215
instead of trying to use vengeance

568
00:30:00.555 --> 00:30:02.495
to solve our problems,

569
00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:06.085
we are supposed to trust God.

570
00:30:08.795 --> 00:30:10.735
We are supposed to trust God.

571
00:30:10.835 --> 00:30:14.295
And that is what will brightly point

572
00:30:14.675 --> 00:30:16.175
to our good God and savior.

573
00:30:18.465 --> 00:30:20.685
In fact, we saw an example

574
00:30:20.825 --> 00:30:23.565
of it this morning in the baptisms.

575
00:30:26.025 --> 00:30:28.135
Maybe you missed it came in a little bit late.

576
00:30:28.135 --> 00:30:29.335
But here, here's the testimony.

577
00:30:29.395 --> 00:30:32.735
One of 'em how it went in this family,

578
00:30:32.875 --> 00:30:34.975
the older brother came to Christ first,

579
00:30:35.715 --> 00:30:38.135
but in their culture that caused pain

580
00:30:38.195 --> 00:30:39.935
and shame to the family.

581
00:30:40.795 --> 00:30:43.375
So much so that the younger brother tried to harm

582
00:30:43.435 --> 00:30:45.055
and even kill the older brother.

583
00:30:47.575 --> 00:30:50.395
Yet it was the older brother's constant faith

584
00:30:50.975 --> 00:30:54.475
and transformed life of peace and love

585
00:30:54.615 --> 00:30:58.635
and kindness that made the younger brother curious

586
00:31:00.315 --> 00:31:02.865
about what he has, that he doesn't have.

587
00:31:04.645 --> 00:31:06.135
Curious enough to read the Bible.

588
00:31:06.225 --> 00:31:08.575
Eventually realizing that he was a sinner too

589
00:31:08.755 --> 00:31:13.015
and that God loved him to send his son to be the sacrifice

590
00:31:13.195 --> 00:31:14.615
to pay for our sins.

591
00:31:15.595 --> 00:31:17.975
And this morning that older brother

592
00:31:18.575 --> 00:31:21.575
baptized the younger brother, like,

593
00:31:22.875 --> 00:31:24.335
do you understand what just happened?

594
00:31:24.335 --> 00:31:28.055
Right? It would be like David baptizing Saul

595
00:31:29.675 --> 00:31:31.775
and Saul saw it and came to faith

596
00:31:31.955 --> 00:31:34.015
and he's like, oh, I guess I need what he has.

597
00:31:34.235 --> 00:31:35.535
And David baptizes him.

598
00:31:35.535 --> 00:31:37.815
Like, here's how the younger brother put it in his testimony

599
00:31:38.145 --> 00:31:40.295
today, I know with all my heart

600
00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:42.015
that Jesus Christ is the truth.

601
00:31:42.395 --> 00:31:45.335
He is the way, the truth and the life. He saved me.

602
00:31:45.555 --> 00:31:47.055
It changed my life forever.

603
00:31:47.615 --> 00:31:50.055
I praise Jesus Christ for bringing me out

604
00:31:50.055 --> 00:31:51.575
of darkness into his marvelous life.

605
00:31:52.405 --> 00:31:53.895
Like that is only God.

606
00:31:57.585 --> 00:31:59.935
Lemme give you a little glimpse. We did not plan all this

607
00:31:59.935 --> 00:32:03.495
to happen today with this sermon like Monday.

608
00:32:03.775 --> 00:32:07.295
I heard that story and I'm just like, okay,

609
00:32:07.445 --> 00:32:10.415
this is the perfect illustration of exactly

610
00:32:10.485 --> 00:32:14.015
what God has done through

611
00:32:14.895 --> 00:32:19.615
a transformed life, through not taking vengeance

612
00:32:21.265 --> 00:32:22.605
To Save a life.

613
00:32:24.145 --> 00:32:26.885
That's what it does. That's what he can free you from.

614
00:32:27.065 --> 00:32:31.245
That's what he can free us from the chains of that

615
00:32:32.045 --> 00:32:34.005
enslavement to vengeance.

616
00:32:36.215 --> 00:32:39.075
And then it frees other people as a result of that.

617
00:32:41.795 --> 00:32:45.015
But here's the question though. Like that's incredible.

618
00:32:45.155 --> 00:32:47.935
But here's the question. I was wrestling with this all week

619
00:32:47.935 --> 00:32:49.135
and I hope you are as well.

620
00:32:50.755 --> 00:32:54.635
How can we get there? How can we

621
00:32:54.635 --> 00:32:56.035
ever get to that point?

622
00:32:56.195 --> 00:32:57.715
'cause the world is only vengeance.

623
00:32:58.345 --> 00:32:59.715
Give people what they deserve.

624
00:32:59.715 --> 00:33:03.815
That's the river we're swimming in. How do we get to that?

625
00:33:06.745 --> 00:33:07.995
I've been hinting at it the whole time,

626
00:33:08.055 --> 00:33:12.595
but the answer is not getting up outta your chair later

627
00:33:12.775 --> 00:33:15.595
and walking away, just trying harder not to be vengeful.

628
00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:19.675
'cause you can't walk away from what's inside here.

629
00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:26.645
And as much as David was a good example in this

630
00:33:26.645 --> 00:33:28.365
moment, he is not perfect.

631
00:33:30.065 --> 00:33:31.565
And there's nothing in him

632
00:33:31.565 --> 00:33:33.205
that could actually transform the

633
00:33:33.205 --> 00:33:34.285
deepest parts of who we are.

634
00:33:34.385 --> 00:33:35.485
He can't do anything.

635
00:33:35.545 --> 00:33:38.325
He can be an example for us, but he is limited.

636
00:33:41.235 --> 00:33:44.155
That's why who this was really pointing us

637
00:33:44.175 --> 00:33:47.275
to was the one called the Son of David,

638
00:33:48.615 --> 00:33:51.195
The Christ, the Messiah, Jesus

639
00:33:51.775 --> 00:33:55.675
who himself embodied power by humility.

640
00:33:58.085 --> 00:34:02.495
Watch this. Jesus embodied power

641
00:34:02.875 --> 00:34:03.975
by his humility.

642
00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:07.855
We've said this before in the series, that David's life

643
00:34:08.915 --> 00:34:13.695
was a type of Christ, meaning it pointed us forward.

644
00:34:14.705 --> 00:34:17.375
David lived a thousand years before Jesus came, right?

645
00:34:18.125 --> 00:34:22.095
David's life pointed us forward to something and and,

646
00:34:22.315 --> 00:34:24.495
and give us images of something

647
00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:26.855
that would be perfectly full.

648
00:34:27.435 --> 00:34:28.455
He gives us hints

649
00:34:31.115 --> 00:34:34.415
and through that lens, when we look through that lens,

650
00:34:34.795 --> 00:34:37.455
the parallels start to jump off the page here.

651
00:34:38.735 --> 00:34:42.365
Watch this. Just think of Jesus' life.

652
00:34:44.855 --> 00:34:46.925
Jesus, when he first started,

653
00:34:46.925 --> 00:34:51.005
after 30 years of obscurity, he lives in in Nazareth area

654
00:34:51.145 --> 00:34:53.325
and at at the beginning of his public ministry,

655
00:34:53.355 --> 00:34:55.325
he's baptized by John.

656
00:34:57.535 --> 00:35:00.875
And as he comes up out of the water, it's in a sense

657
00:35:01.415 --> 00:35:03.715
the public anointing of Jesus.

658
00:35:04.855 --> 00:35:06.355
The Father speaks, it's my beloved

659
00:35:06.495 --> 00:35:07.755
son, to whom I'm well pleased.

660
00:35:07.975 --> 00:35:09.955
The dove of the Holy Spirit floats down.

661
00:35:10.465 --> 00:35:12.915
It's, it's like this anointing has happened

662
00:35:12.935 --> 00:35:16.155
and everybody notices this guy in a sense for the first time

663
00:35:19.295 --> 00:35:23.435
yet three years go by before his cru.

664
00:35:23.655 --> 00:35:26.915
So he spent three years with that anointing.

665
00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:33.875
Yet he did not grasp for the fulfillment

666
00:35:34.055 --> 00:35:37.885
of God's promises in that anointing prematurely

667
00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:41.845
a lot like David, right?

668
00:35:42.695 --> 00:35:46.525
David was anointed, had to wait through all kinds of things

669
00:35:46.865 --> 00:35:49.765
to get to where he finally was given it by God instead

670
00:35:49.765 --> 00:35:50.765
of taking it himself.

671
00:35:50.775 --> 00:35:53.365
Watch this, Jesus in the wilderness in Matthew four,

672
00:35:54.555 --> 00:35:55.845
he's tempted by the enemy.

673
00:35:56.615 --> 00:35:57.765
Satan comes to him and says,

674
00:35:57.905 --> 00:35:59.685
you can have all the kingdoms of the world

675
00:35:59.685 --> 00:36:00.685
Right now.

676
00:36:02.355 --> 00:36:05.335
And Jesus says, Nope, it's not time yet.

677
00:36:07.255 --> 00:36:09.775
And he said, knowing I'll get those eventually

678
00:36:10.355 --> 00:36:12.495
in God the father's time, but not yet.

679
00:36:14.085 --> 00:36:17.545
And so he resisted. He did not take it by force.

680
00:36:17.555 --> 00:36:19.425
Think of Jesus in the garden.

681
00:36:21.215 --> 00:36:24.025
He's wrestling with this overwhelming nature

682
00:36:24.365 --> 00:36:26.705
of carrying our sin to the cross.

683
00:36:27.205 --> 00:36:31.385
Yet he said, he determined not as I will, but as you will.

684
00:36:31.605 --> 00:36:36.135
My Father, full submission

685
00:36:36.195 --> 00:36:37.775
to his father's will throughout his

686
00:36:37.775 --> 00:36:41.675
Life Think of Jesus submitting

687
00:36:41.935 --> 00:36:44.355
to the humiliation of the cross,

688
00:36:44.495 --> 00:36:46.875
having every power at his disposal

689
00:36:47.295 --> 00:36:50.475
to get down off the cross, to strike down those

690
00:36:50.495 --> 00:36:53.275
who were captivating, who were who were killing him.

691
00:36:53.495 --> 00:36:55.995
He had every opportunity to do that.

692
00:36:56.295 --> 00:36:58.755
Yet here's what Philippians two

693
00:36:58.785 --> 00:37:03.025
Says, Though he was in the form of God.

694
00:37:03.045 --> 00:37:07.145
He did not count equality a thing to be grasped, held onto,

695
00:37:07.885 --> 00:37:10.425
but he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant,

696
00:37:10.555 --> 00:37:13.345
being born in likeness of men being found in human form.

697
00:37:13.345 --> 00:37:16.825
He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point

698
00:37:17.005 --> 00:37:19.825
of death, even death on a cross.

699
00:37:21.085 --> 00:37:23.265
That's humble submission, right?

700
00:37:23.845 --> 00:37:27.025
Not grasping it himself, but humbly submitting.

701
00:37:29.155 --> 00:37:31.345
Think about even now, Jesus.

702
00:37:31.615 --> 00:37:34.785
Hebrews 10 teaches us when Christ offered

703
00:37:34.845 --> 00:37:37.145
for all time a single sacrifice for sins,

704
00:37:37.245 --> 00:37:41.545
he sat down at the right hand of God waiting from that time

705
00:37:41.955 --> 00:37:45.865
until his enemies shall be made a footstool for his feet.

706
00:37:48.165 --> 00:37:50.305
See, here's the point. We must have the same

707
00:37:50.855 --> 00:37:52.345
mind in ourselves.

708
00:37:52.535 --> 00:37:54.505
That humility of Christ

709
00:37:54.765 --> 00:37:57.225
who had all the power, all the potential.

710
00:37:57.365 --> 00:38:00.345
Yet he revealed it through his submission,

711
00:38:00.895 --> 00:38:04.865
through his humble submission, trusting his father

712
00:38:05.125 --> 00:38:09.105
to give him the authority he knew was his at right time.

713
00:38:09.365 --> 00:38:12.265
In his father's time, his father's way, he said,

714
00:38:12.325 --> 00:38:14.345
I'm not going to take it myself.

715
00:38:15.535 --> 00:38:18.625
Even if it meant he had to suffer

716
00:38:19.405 --> 00:38:23.555
For it, even die for it.

717
00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:30.435
Yet, aren't you glad that because

718
00:38:31.135 --> 00:38:32.835
He Did that

719
00:38:35.305 --> 00:38:39.565
We have a hope in life and death

720
00:38:41.515 --> 00:38:46.045
because Jesus waited, did not claim himself.

721
00:38:46.465 --> 00:38:49.405
He submitted fully even to death.

722
00:38:49.585 --> 00:38:52.645
We have a hope in life and death.

723
00:38:53.305 --> 00:38:57.365
His perfect suffering serves us, saves us

724
00:38:58.035 --> 00:39:00.925
such that we can then identify with him

725
00:39:01.225 --> 00:39:03.205
as we suffer, as we wait.

726
00:39:05.585 --> 00:39:07.525
But what that waiting does is it helps us grow,

727
00:39:08.535 --> 00:39:12.565
helps us trust, helps us depend on him

728
00:39:12.865 --> 00:39:17.045
to submit our lives to him, to work it all out for us.

729
00:39:19.905 --> 00:39:21.965
Here's how I wanna close with this passage of scripture.

730
00:39:22.585 --> 00:39:24.925
It perfectly encapsulates everything I've said today.

731
00:39:24.985 --> 00:39:27.445
It points us to the hope of Christ forever. And Everett.

732
00:39:27.445 --> 00:39:31.085
First Peter chapter two verses 19 through 24.

733
00:39:31.425 --> 00:39:32.765
Go read it later as well.

734
00:39:32.985 --> 00:39:36.565
But this is what we will lead into singing as a response

735
00:39:36.625 --> 00:39:37.965
to this is what it says.

736
00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:41.885
This is a gracious thing when mindful of God,

737
00:39:42.345 --> 00:39:45.325
one endures sorrows while suffering.

738
00:39:45.525 --> 00:39:48.405
Unjustly for what credit is it?

739
00:39:49.425 --> 00:39:51.325
If you, when you suffer and are beaten

740
00:39:51.425 --> 00:39:53.485
or when you sin are beaten for it, you endure.

741
00:39:54.145 --> 00:39:57.005
But if when you do good and suffer for it, you endure.

742
00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:59.845
This is a gracious thing in the sight of God.

743
00:40:00.785 --> 00:40:02.645
For to this you have been called

744
00:40:02.795 --> 00:40:05.965
because Christ also suffered for you,

745
00:40:06.875 --> 00:40:08.205
leaving you an example.

746
00:40:08.425 --> 00:40:12.645
So you might follow in his steps. He committed no sin.

747
00:40:12.675 --> 00:40:16.405
Neither was deceit found in his mouth. When he was reviled.

748
00:40:16.585 --> 00:40:19.605
He did not revile in return when he suffered,

749
00:40:19.945 --> 00:40:20.965
he did not threaten,

750
00:40:21.305 --> 00:40:24.765
but he continued entrusting himself to him

751
00:40:25.065 --> 00:40:26.685
who judges justly.

752
00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:32.325
He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree

753
00:40:32.515 --> 00:40:34.365
that we might die to sin

754
00:40:34.545 --> 00:40:38.565
and live to righteousness by his wounds.

755
00:40:38.865 --> 00:40:40.365
You have been healed.

756
00:40:41.095 --> 00:40:43.965
Let's stand together and let's respond to that Savior

757
00:40:44.505 --> 00:40:45.285
for his goodness.
