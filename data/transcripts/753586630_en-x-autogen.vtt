00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.600
Who is

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.900
the god like Yahweh the god

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.500
of wrath the god of Mercy

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.400
The God Who reaches down to

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400
unworthy people.

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.400
It sure is good to be together this morning church.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.600
Go ahead and take your copy of God's word and turn to Micah chapter

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.500
4 with me if you would.

9
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.900
Open the app scroll down Micah 4.

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.600
Actually going to slip into chapter 5 a little bit.

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.000
Now normally I start a sermon with some kind of.

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000
creative illustration or personal story or

13
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.400
something else to get our minds working towards what God has

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.500
for us in his word.

15
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.900
But today I feel that it's just right to start by acknowledging the

16
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.500
pain and suffering that many people are feeling right

17
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.700
now.

18
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.400
for various reasons various causes

19
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.800
It's been a hard week for a lot of people including me

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.400
including our church, including our city

21
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.100
including the world. I mean, it's

22
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.000
it's everywhere. In fact his Elders on Tuesday night. We just

23
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.600
spent an extended time of focused prayer for the emotional

24
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.600
needs in our church.

25
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.300
Those that we know about and those that

26
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.200
we don't know about.

27
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.600
Maybe for you. It's a new diagnosis.

28
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.600
or inflation hitting you hard

29
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.900
or it's conflict in your family. That just doesn't seem to end.

30
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.800
Or it's the political situation in our nation.

31
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.400
Or maybe it's one of the three deaths that we had in the last three

32
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400
days in our church.

33
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.900
including

34
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.200
David Bolivar who write down on the front row every

35
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.500
week and

36
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
So could be one of those things for you or

37
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.700
it could be.

38
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.300
What happened with the police officer this week and your families affected by

39
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.500
that or you're just worried about things or maybe it's

40
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.900
even shame from your past.

41
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.200
There's just this emotional struggle and it's pain that

42
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.100
you're feeling some of you might even be to the point where you

43
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.300
feel like this as Saints of old have called The Dark

44
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.400
Night of the Soul.

45
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.900
You feel like God is absent like how could God ever be here and

46
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.300
stuff like this or where you feel like, it's just

47
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.700
all hopeless and there's no way out of this.

48
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.500
First let me remind you something that you don't have

49
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.800
to suffer in silence.

50
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.300
let someone in

51
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.400
Here, it's okay. Not to be okay here.

52
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.900
Want to be able to face things head on difficult.

53
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.700
Situations the Bible commands us to weep with those

54
00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.700
who weep.

55
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600
So this is a part of what it is to be a church.

56
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.300
But here's the problem that I've found over the years of ministry. Is that

57
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.800
most people

58
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.300
Have no theological understanding of suffering.

59
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.200
Can't figure out no way to

60
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.400
grasp what God is doing in the middle of pain.

61
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.400
And so what we do with the pain instead?

62
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.100
Is we medicate it?

63
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.100
We avoid it.

64
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.600
Even deny it.

65
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.400
But that kind of a perspective on pain and suffering

66
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.200
misses the truth. We're gonna see in Micah for

67
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.300
today.

68
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.000
a truth that for them back then sparked this

69
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.600
sustaining hope

70
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.900
But also I believe a hope that can sustain us.

71
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.200
And change us just as much today.

72
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.200
It's a hope that while we may feel like

73
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.600
we're in a dark night right now.

74
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.600
Might feel that that is true now.

75
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.400
By God's mercy. The world does not end in

76
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.100
a tragedy.

77
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.800
There's an eternal Sunrise that is coming.

78
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.600
And the pain is not permanent.

79
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.200
It's what Psalm 30 verse 5 says so well in the New Living

80
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.100
Translation, it says weeping may last through the night, but

81
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.400
joy comes with the morning.

82
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.400
Like if you get nothing else today.

83
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.300
It's all centered around that weeping may last through the

84
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.500
night, but joy comes with the morning.

85
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.200
We'll see that in Micah for today.

86
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.500
starting in verse 6 down through chapter 5 verse

87
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.600
1

88
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.100
In that day declares the Lord I will assemble the

89
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.500
lame and gather those who've been driven away and Those whom I've afflicted.

90
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.600
The lame I will make a Remnant those who were cast

91
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600
off a strong Nation.

92
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.100
And the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion from this

93
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.300
time forth and forevermore.

94
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.100
And you owe Tower of the flock Hill of the

95
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.400
daughter of Zion that's talking about Jerusalem to you. Shall

96
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.700
it come the former Dominion shall come kingship for

97
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.900
the daughter of Jerusalem.

98
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.300
Now, why do you cry aloud is there no King

99
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.600
in you?

100
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.000
as your counselor perished

101
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.100
that pain seized you like a woman in labor.

102
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.300
Writhe and groan or push. Oh Daughter

103
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.100
of Zion like a woman in labor.

104
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.400
For now, you should go out from the city and dwell in the Open Country.

105
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.100
You shall go to Babylon.

106
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.300
There you shall be rescued. They're the

107
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.700
Lord will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.

108
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.300
Now many nations are assembled against you saying let

109
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.400
her be defiled let our eyes gaze upon Zion.

110
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.000
But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord.

111
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.500
They do not understand his plan that he's gathered

112
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.400
them as sheaves to the threshing floor.

113
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.200
Rise and thresh. So Daughter of Zion for

114
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.400
I will make your horn iron. I'll make your hoofs bronze.

115
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.400
You shall beat in pieces many people shall devote

116
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.200
their game to the Lord their wealth to the lord of the whole

117
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.500
Earth.

118
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.600
Now muster your troops. Oh daughter of troops.

119
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.700
Siege is laid against us.

120
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.300
With a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the

121
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.800
cheek.

122
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.000
So like we saw last week in verse 1 as Micah

123
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.800
referenced what he said the latter days this phrase here

124
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.800
the that day in verse 6 is also referring

125
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.600
pointing forward to this full and

126
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.000
final reign of the Messiah King.

127
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.800
That day is the day the Messiah

128
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.400
returns that General time around there that

129
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.300
he brings a host of reversals into this upside down

130
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.600
world.

131
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.300
And so Micah is looking forward but unlike

132
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.900
last week.

133
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.900
We was pretty simple to understand how the future Dynamic

134
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.000
of that worked. It was all looking forward to the

135
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.000
end here. It seems like Micah's jumping back and forth.

136
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.500
Between his day and the future and maybe even interim times between

137
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.500
it makes it difficult to understand what he's referring to.

138
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.300
Is he talking about something happening at the moment? He's saying these

139
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.400
things he's talking about some prophetic future event. Is

140
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.500
he talking about even some interim thing that like return from

141
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.300
Babylon? What's he talking about throughout this mix? It

142
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.900
seems like it's back and forth.

143
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.900
Even complicating matters is that profits would often include double

144
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.100
references to things where we have

145
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.300
a historic understanding of something that he says

146
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.000
happened and it did happen, but it's also saying it's going to

147
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.000
happen again someday.

148
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.200
Maybe in a little different way, but it's going to happen someday future.

149
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.500
So it's so confusing. That's why Scholars have

150
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.600
debated these things for centuries.

151
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.300
Just know that I can't explain it in 30 minutes. Okay. So this is

152
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.600
the idea that we're going to have is that there's a lot of muddiness here.

153
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.000
I'm gonna try to make it less money along the way

154
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.300
but there's a lot of confusing things here.

155
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.400
But here's the thing we know for sure.

156
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.800
When we look at this just like I said last week Micah

157
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.300
here is primarily referring to what we

158
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.600
call the kingdom of God.

159
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.200
It keeps referencing mostly the kingdom of

160
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.700
God here that past present future Kingdom

161
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.800
that kind of goes above worldly countries and

162
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.400
people it's like the kingdom of God over all

163
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.200
of this past present future and what Mike is

164
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.200
doing in this section last week. He did this week

165
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.900
again. He's showing what will happen.

166
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.500
as God Reigns in people's hearts

167
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.500
more today

168
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.800
But also what will happen as he reigns someday in

169
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.000
the future on Earth in physical form.

170
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.100
Like that's coming. It's not just we get to get out of here. Go to heaven

171
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.300
that someday. It's coming back to a new heavens and new

172
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:17.600
earth here.

173
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.000
That's how we're going to apply this today. There's there's going to

174
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.600
be some things we look at both prophetically forward and

175
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.900
what will happen in some specific things. But also, how

176
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.700
does this matter for us today?

177
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.900
How is this valuable for our daily lives?

178
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.500
We'll see a couple truths first.

179
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.900
The truth to observe here is that in the kingdom of God weakness is

180
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.100
shaped into strength.

181
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.400
We learn this right here weakness is

182
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.300
shaped into strength, especially clear versus six through

183
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:54.500
eight.

184
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.100
He mentions the lame.

185
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.100
You afflicted.

186
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.700
The cast off driven away one.

187
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.200
He talks about those who are weak.

188
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.200
Leave labeling out. All this groups of people that we don't know who is who but

189
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.100
but they're all weak ones. But what he says is that they will

190
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.600
now be gathered back into the land and they will be made into a strong

191
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.700
Nation now,

192
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.000
Even the former Dominion the former King ship shall

193
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.200
come back to Jerusalem.

194
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.400
To the city remember at the end of chapter three we saw was

195
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.200
about to be destroyed by the enemies. It says no, it's

196
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.700
actually going to come back someday.

197
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400
to this location

198
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.400
what that means the whole time is that God had not forgotten them.

199
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.500
That the Sheep had been injured the Sheep had been scattered,

200
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.000
but the great Shepherd would gather his flock back

201
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.500
together.

202
00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.400
Those who trust him. That's what he calls The Remnant those who

203
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.500
trust in him as their king would be gathered around

204
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.400
this Tower in verse 8. Now.

205
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.900
What's about the tower? Well, that's an illustration of safety.

206
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.000
Because they would build up part of their land and that would

207
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.600
be where the shepherd would stand up high and he would watch and

208
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.600
scan for threats that were coming to his flock

209
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.300
that he was wanting to protect. Of course. They would

210
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.600
gather around the tower and Micah says that Tower

211
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.600
is going to be Jerusalem again someday.

212
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.300
Which means it's gonna be a safe place.

213
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.700
It's gonna be a place that God's people can come to and be

214
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.300
safe because

215
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.100
God would be among his flock there.

216
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.800
Not just because it's a walled City. But because God himself

217
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.000
is back among his flock. That's

218
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.500
what makes them.

219
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.500
a strong Nation

220
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.600
now we know looking historically there was a limited fulfillment of

221
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.500
this promise.

222
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.300
A couple hundred years later from when Micah wrote this as

223
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.800
Ezra and Nehemiah led the Exiles back into Jerusalem.

224
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.200
They began to rebuild the city it began to look a little

225
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.100
bit like this.

226
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.700
But not fully right?

227
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.800
So we know ultimately that verse 7 indicates. It

228
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.600
says fourth time forth and forevermore. This is

229
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.600
talking about the Eternal Kingdom.

230
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.700
When when God fully destroys

231
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.900
his enemies and he reigns fully Forever

232
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.400
on the earth. This is talking about that

233
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.200
time that day right the latter days.

234
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.100
It's talking about that time where he reigns and all those

235
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.800
who had been afflicted by their own sin. And by

236
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.300
other people's sin if they trust in the king,

237
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.400
they'll be safe. They'll be home. They'll be secure.

238
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.900
What a promise to look forward to right.

239
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.400
Think about these people who are under such threat the enemy

240
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.200
Assyrians were right on the outside of their walls and they're hearing this

241
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.800
and say, okay, even if this thing gets destroyed it's coming back. Someday God's

242
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.800
gonna take care of us. He's going to protect us.

243
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.200
They thought all hope was lost. But no Micah says it's coming

244
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:13.400
back.

245
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.400
But also think for us today that knowing this is coming for us. There's

246
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.300
a day that all will be secure. There'll be no more pain in sorrow

247
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:22.800
and suffering.

248
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.900
It's good news.

249
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.700
But think think now a little more deeply into

250
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.600
this about how this this weakness into

251
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.300
strength idea. How does that relate to us? How does that affect our

252
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.400
day-to-day lives both individually and as

253
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.000
a church, how does this

254
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.700
Change us.

255
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.300
How does it change our attitudes how we're respond to other people

256
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.200
how we view people? How does weakness into strength and the

257
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.400
kingdom of God change us?

258
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.700
first it means

259
00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.400
That you don't have to have it all together to be a part of this Kingdom.

260
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.600
Did you notice God is going after?

261
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.200
the lame

262
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.000
The Afflicted the outcasts The Driven away God is

263
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.200
pursuing them. Now

264
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.100
we know those conditions had to do with their own sin primarily. It's

265
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.400
the reason they were that way but even

266
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.300
if it was someone else's sin, it's still affected

267
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:21.600
them.

268
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.300
And they were they were hurting they were outcasts. And

269
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.500
so they're feeling this separation feeling this Exile from

270
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.700
God that there was such distance.

271
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.400
Yet God was pursuing them.

272
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.500
He was inviting them into his secure

273
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.900
home if they would trust him.

274
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.700
He sang Come On In.

275
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.300
Which in fact is the entry point to the kingdom of

276
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:50.500
God?

277
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.600
Jesus said it Matthew 5 verse 3. He said blessed

278
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.400
are the poor in spirit.

279
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.700
For theirs shall be the kingdom of heaven.

280
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.300
Right that poverty of spirit.

281
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.200
It's not that just you.

282
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.400
Were downcast and you think lowly of

283
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.400
yourself. It's the idea that you have a humble recognition

284
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.000
of your sin your weakness your separation from

285
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.600
God and you bring nothing to the table. That's the

286
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.300
poverty of spirit. But in that acknowledgment you then

287
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.400
come to Jesus.

288
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.400
You come to him and say Lord. I

289
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.700
need you. I need your life death and Resurrection in

290
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.400
my place to count for me. I cannot do

291
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.900
this on my own. I am weak. I am in darkness.

292
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.900
I need you.

293
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.800
Here's the reality of our world that we live in.

294
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.100
It will scream to you.

295
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.700
Only the Strong Survive

296
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.300
don't show weakness climb on other people to

297
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.800
get what you want, right? That's what the world says. But

298
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.500
God does not notice. God does not turn

299
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.600
weak people away from the kingdom of God.

300
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.000
Which actually pulls them in?

301
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.800
He goes after them and says you're weak. Come on, you're weak.

302
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.300
Come on.

303
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.800
He gives Grace to those who acknowledge their weakness.

304
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.500
He gives Grace to them.

305
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.200
And so start there.

306
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.000
Start there.

307
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.200
Because here's what God does with it.

308
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.100
When we acknowledge that we are weak and

309
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.700
we get to that place. What he does is he uses weak ones

310
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.600
for his glory.

311
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.400
He turns in the kingdom of God. He turns weakness into

312
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.500
strength.

313
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.600
Just listen to First Corinthians 1.

314
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.300
Versus 26 through 31. He says consider your

315
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.700
calling not many of you were wise according

316
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.500
to worldly standards. Not many were powerful

317
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.800
not many were of noble birth. But God chose

318
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.800
what is foolish in the world to shame the wise God

319
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.200
chose? What is weak in the world to shame the

320
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.100
strong God chose? What is low and despised in

321
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.200
the world even things that are not to bring to nothing things that are

322
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.000
so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.

323
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.900
And because of him you are in Christ Jesus who became

324
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.200
to us wisdom from God righteousness sanctification

325
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.300
Redemption so that as it

326
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.600
is written let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.

327
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.500
Did you see what that said?

328
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.400
It said that you might be weeping through the night

329
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.700
of life right now.

330
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.100
Even just comparatively where you're you're looking

331
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.400
around everybody else seems to be strong. Everybody else seems to have it all together and

332
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.400
you know, you don't and so you're you're weeping you're

333
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.400
through the dark but hear me joy comes with the morning.

334
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.600
This is the kingdom of God. This is what Jesus does in you

335
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.600
and and he gives joy and it's not just in

336
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.100
how he uses you. He gives you Joy just in him in

337
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.500
his salvation just in his presence that

338
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.200
he would invite you in include you a part

339
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.200
of his family like just be in that for a second, right?

340
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.400
There's joy that God would choose a

341
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.200
weak one like you a weak one like me and say come

342
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.900
on into my family.

343
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.200
Never earn. It. Don't deserve it. Come on.

344
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.500
Joy in that church.

345
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.100
But then understand this too. We saw it here that

346
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.600
that even more joy comes whenever the Lord

347
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600
uses you.

348
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.000
For his purposes his kingdom principle purposes.

349
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.600
And I know some of you're sitting there saying well.

350
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.100
How can he ever use me?

351
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.500
I don't have any big gifts. I can't speak on the stage. I don't have much of

352
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.100
money and you know my past I mean, you know

353
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.500
what I've done. How could God ever use me? Yes, you're thinking

354
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.800
that but you have to remember this. It's not about you.

355
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.300
You're the tool in the Master's Hand, right?

356
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.300
Did you notice something? Look how many times in Micah 4 God says?

357
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.800
I will assemble I will gather I

358
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.300
will make them the remnant I will make

359
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.400
them a strong Nation. I will reign over them. It's

360
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.100
not about you.

361
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.500
Yeah, you're weak. He acknowledges that you're weak. But he

362
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.300
chose the weak to shame the strong who think they're strong.

363
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.900
That's why the kingdom entry point is humble faith.

364
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.300
Because listen if I think that that all that I can do

365
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.200
is because I'm so awesome and I got all the gifts and

366
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.500
I've got all the abilities who gets the glory for that.

367
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:43.500
I do.

368
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.500
But if I acknowledge the truth about

369
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.600
my life that I am so weak that

370
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.000
I really am by the grace of

371
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.900
God everything that I am like if I have an honest acknowledgment

372
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.200
of my true self, then who gets the

373
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.400
glory whenever God works through me.

374
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.600
Feed Us

375
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.500
That's the point of this.

376
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.200
It's been said this way. I love this quote. God created the world out of

377
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.500
nothing.

378
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.700
As long as you are not yet, nothing God

379
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.000
cannot make something out of you.

380
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.200
You've got to acknowledge weakness and

381
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.600
and that you are really nothing and that God then does something

382
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.400
miraculous in you and through

383
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:30.500
you.

384
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.800
Because in the kingdom of God weakness is shaped into strength.

385
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.600
It's backwards. I know.

386
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.800
But that's how God shows himself off.

387
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.400
That's what second Corinthians 12 verses 9 and 10

388
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:48.500
says

389
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.300
but he said to me my grace is sufficient for

390
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:53.500
you.

391
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.500
For my power is made perfect in weakness.

392
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.200
Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my

393
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.600
weaknesses so that the power of Christ May

394
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.200
rest upon me.

395
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.100
For the sake of Christ, then I am content with weaknesses

396
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.700
insults hardships persecution calamities.

397
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.200
For when I am weak.

398
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:19.600
I'm strong.

399
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.200
In the kingdom of God, he turns weakness into strength.

400
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.300
Here's the second truth. We observe in Micah 4 about this Kingdom.

401
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.900
Suffering is shaped into character.

402
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.200
Suffering is shaped into character.

403
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.100
I said before there's a lot of Yoyo in this verse These passages.

404
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.500
Regarding the time when things are happening. They were going to go through suffering.

405
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.600
That was talked about a lot through this. There's a lot of struggle they're

406
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.300
going through but God in verse 10 in his grace.

407
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.400
God would redeem them. It's a beautiful word that word

408
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.700
redeem used all over the Old Testament talking about

409
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.600
purchasing back a lost object.

410
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.500
It's with Ruth that whole story kinsman redeemer. That's that's part of that. Same

411
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.200
word that God says here. He's going to redeem his

412
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.500
people out of the land of Babylon.

413
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.000
So this is not all bad news.

414
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.200
But notice something in verses 9 and 10,

415
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.200
I'm gonna read those again. I want you to look at these two

416
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.100
verses look for the imperatives the commands here.

417
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.200
Verse 9. He asked the question. Why do you cry out? Is there no King in you?

418
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.500
Talking about like they forgot that they had a

419
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.600
king really was God has your counselor perished that

420
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.000
pain sees you like a woman in labor. Now. Look at this.

421
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.400
Rise grown or push?

422
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.900
O Daughter of Zion like a woman in labor now, you

423
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.100
shall go out from the

424
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.500
city you shall dwell in the Open Country. You

425
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.100
shall go to Babylon. Those are commands.

426
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.200
But there you shall be rescued and we see this hope they're the

427
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.600
Lord of redeem you from the hand of your enemies. You see the commands

428
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.000
there though.

429
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.100
There were commands given God said through Micah. He's

430
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.400
commanding them to suffer like

431
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.200
a woman in labor.

432
00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.100
By the way, remember at this time there were no epidurals. So this was

433
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.100
like the full thing, right?

434
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.200
He says you're going to suffer. That's what God is

435
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.200
comparing to this Exile that was about to come. He's saying

436
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.500
you're gonna have to go through this. You're gonna be rescued. Yes,

437
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.800
but you have to go through this now.

438
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:47.900
their job

439
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.400
was to endure the discipline that

440
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.300
God was bringing due to their sin and Rebellion.

441
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.500
think about this metaphor though for a second this childbirth metaphor

442
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:02.700
he gives

443
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.500
Absolutely terrible suffering for a season, but the end

444
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.500
result of bringing forth that baby is worth

445
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:10.700
it.

446
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.800
And even the glory of the

447
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.300
birth and the baby that you get on

448
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.200
the other end is magnified by the enduring of the

449
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.800
suffering to get there.

450
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.400
It's worth it even more because of what you go through to get there.

451
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.900
That's what Yahweh was doing here with his people.

452
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.600
He had to discipline them.

453
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.500
To tear down their sin so that

454
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.800
he could build up them again in righteousness and

455
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.300
holiness.

456
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.300
They're pain had a purpose.

457
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.200
To refine them to change them that they

458
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.400
wouldn't have learned any other way, but they had to go through this to understand.

459
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.300
It's the same for us today, isn't it?

460
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.700
When God disciplines those he loves.

461
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.100
God's purpose is not

462
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.900
Revenge

463
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.500
or Vengeance or anger his purpose his

464
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.100
growth correction.

465
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.800
It's what Hebrews 12 says.

466
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.400
Verses 5 through 11 says have you forgotten the

467
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.700
exhortation that addresses you as Sons?

468
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.300
My son do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord

469
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.100
nor be weary when reproved or corrected by

470
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.700
him for the Lord disciplines the one he loves.

471
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.400
chastises every son who he receives

472
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.200
It's for discipline. You have to endure.

473
00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.200
God is treating you as Sons for what son is

474
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.800
there whom his father does not discipline.

475
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.700
If you're left without discipline in which all have participated your

476
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.000
illegitimate children not Sons.

477
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.200
Besides us we've had Earthly fathers who disciplined us

478
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.200
and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to

479
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.700
the father of spirits and live.

480
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.600
For they discipline us for a short times it seem best to them. But God

481
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.500
disciplines us for our good that we

482
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.600
may share his holiness.

483
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.400
For the moment all discipline seems painful rather

484
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.300
than Pleasant.

485
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.300
But later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those

486
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.700
who have been trained by it.

487
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.300
So you see it right there that often for us to

488
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.600
get where we need to be.

489
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.100
For us to get where God wants us to

490
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:32.300
be.

491
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.500
We have to be disciplined.

492
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.700
But don't ever forget God. Does that out of love for

493
00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:41.900
you?

494
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.100
It's not Vengeance. It's not spite. He does it out of

495
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.700
love when we blow it when we make a mess of Our Lives. God

496
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.500
loves us enough to redirect us toward

497
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.300
his right way. He wants better for us. He doesn't

498
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.900
want us to walk down that path is going to destroy us and others.

499
00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.900
He loves us too much.

500
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.600
Let us go that way.

501
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.300
They brings us back. Of course, it seems painful. Like when when

502
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.400
you're a discipline as a child. You don't look at your parents. Say

503
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.500
yeah, thank you. That was awesome like you it's not pleasant.

504
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:15.800
painful

505
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.400
But we can't get to the peaceful fruit of righteousness.

506
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.900
Without being trained by God's discipline

507
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.400
in our lives.

508
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.100
part of the deal

509
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.300
and so I think we understand that inherently. I think we get the fact

510
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.300
that I blew it. I need to be disciplined so I can grow. Yes, we get

511
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:40.600
that.

512
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.000
But here's what's harder to grasp.

513
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.500
The times in our lives when we suffer.

514
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.500
And it's not our fault.

515
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.300
When we suffer because of someone else's sin.

516
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.200
And there's even times in our lives other other times where we

517
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.800
just we suffer just because we live in a broken world.

518
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.200
Because we live in a fallen world and people die and

519
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.700
cancer happens and it's not anybody's fault necessarily.

520
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.300
Like those are the harder ones to understand, right?

521
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.100
But hear me even in all of that.

522
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.300
Even in those moments of suffering. God uses

523
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.800
even that to shape you.

524
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.400
To change you to bring about character in

525
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:33.800
your life.

526
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.800
That's what Romans 5 verses 3 through 5 says.

527
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.400
Not only that but we rejoice in

528
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.400
our sufferings.

529
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.700
Knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance

530
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.800
produces character and character produces hope

531
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.500
and hope does not put us to shame because God's

532
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.100
love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy

533
00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.500
Spirit who has been given to us.

534
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.800
in other words if you allow it to

535
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.600
if you allow God to work in you through

536
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.200
your suffering then God will bring character in

537
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:10.500
your life.

538
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.800
And that character leads to Hope because it's not.

539
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.200
Judgment God's love has been poured into

540
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.300
our heart. It's out of love that he's disciplined. He's

541
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.100
suffering these allowing these things to happen because he loves you

542
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.000
enough to give you hope in the middle of all of it.

543
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.600
See our understanding of suffering must be based in the

544
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.300
sovereignty of God.

545
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.600
That if we have repented and believed in Jesus in

546
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.100
our place, if we are his by faith, we

547
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.400
can believe that everything he does

548
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.300
everything he allows is because he does love us.

549
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.100
We may not understand why.

550
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.100
And we might not even like it.

551
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.600
We might grow as we suffer through it.

552
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.100
But we can have hope.

553
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.500
That just like he was going to redeem them from the Exile. He

554
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.400
is Our Redeemer as well and that

555
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.200
for those who love God all things work together

556
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.400
for good for those who are called according to his purpose Romans. 8:28

557
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:15.700
says

558
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.400
And what is that purpose the very next verse verse 29 the purpose

559
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.500
is to be conformed to the image of his son.

560
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.500
character

561
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.200
everything in our lives works for his purpose and that's

562
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.900
to make us look more like Jesus.

563
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.300
I rarely recommend books in sermons, but

564
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.100
this one.

565
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.500
by Elizabeth Elliott

566
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.800
called suffering is Never for Nothing.

567
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.700
Would be well worth your investment.

568
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.700
If you don't know her story, she has a great perspective on terrible trials in

569
00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.200
life. Her husband was killed as a missionary.

570
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:01.800
She knows.

571
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.100
But listen to one of the quotes from the book, she said I

572
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.200
don't know what you're going through talking to you or me. I don't

573
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.500
know what you're going through but I can say that I know the

574
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.400
one who knows.

575
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.000
And I have come to see that it's through the deepest suffering

576
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.700
that God has taught me the deepest lesson.

577
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.000
in the kingdom of God

578
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.700
suffering is shaped into character.

579
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.000
So when life is hard?

580
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.000
Don't throw your hands up and say forget this I give up.

581
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.900
When life is hard don't seek relief in the wrong places. Don't

582
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.200
don't run after things that would hurt you.

583
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.800
No instead press into the Lord.

584
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.100
Seek him in the darkness you're walking in

585
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.500
knowing that this light and momentary Affliction is preparing

586
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.400
for us an eternal weight of Glory. That is beyond

587
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.400
all comparison these four 17

588
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.500
This light and as heavy as it feel light

589
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.700
and momentary affliction.

590
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.100
It's preparing us for something.

591
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:10.700
infinitely better

592
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.500
morning is coming.

593
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.800
The Eternal Sunrise is coming one day daylight

594
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.700
is near so get ready.

595
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.300
There's one more aspect of the kingdom of God. We find here in

596
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:28.800
this passage.

597
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.200
It's that threat is shaped into victory.

598
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.000
Thread is shaped into victory.

599
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.300
I want to read again chapter 4 verse 11 down through

600
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.300
chapter 5 verse 1

601
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.000
Micah looks at his

602
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.200
contemporaries. He says many nations are assembled against you now.

603
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.100
And they're saying let her be defiled let our eyes gaze upon

604
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.300
Zahn. Maybe they're wanting to destroy the city, but they do

605
00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.700
not know the thoughts of the Lord.

606
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.200
They do not understand his plan that he's gathered them

607
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.300
as sheaves to the threshing floor a rise and

608
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.200
thresh show Daughter of Zion. I'll Make Your Horn Iron. I'll

609
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.600
make your hoofs bronze. You shall be in pieces many people's devote

610
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.900
their gain to the Lord their wealth of the Lord the whole Earth.

611
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.400
Muster your troops daughter troops sieges laid

612
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:19.800
against us.

613
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.500
With a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the

614
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:23.800
cheek.

615
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.100
So again this roller coaster ride of time

616
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.100
jumps back and forth, but some of the seems like

617
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.700
it's happening right around Micah in the moment some of it seems like it's future. It's

618
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.200
gonna happen someday.

619
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:38.800
So what do we do with this?

620
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.500
We can nitpick and discuss and debate

621
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.600
for hours over the details here. But here's what here's

622
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.700
what they needed to know. First. The original here is they need to understand that

623
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.300
there was a final Victory coming one day, right?

624
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.500
So hang on right? There's it may look bad now, but

625
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.300
there's a coming a day when everything will be the way

626
00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.000
it's supposed to be.

627
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.500
But they would have needed hope to carry on during that day

628
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.800
too, right?

629
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.400
As the swords and Spears clattered around outside the

630
00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.000
walls and they're like, how do we even hang on today? That's

631
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.900
what Micah showed him.

632
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.100
that even though

633
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.100
the enemy seemed to be dominating Judah at

634
00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:22.300
that time.

635
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.600
God had a plan in all of it.

636
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.100
I read it this week in a commentary. It said the enemies think they

637
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:35.200
have a brilliant plan to gather at Jerusalem, but actually

638
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.300
it is God who's Gathering them?

639
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.400
They want to destroy Jerusalem, but in the end God will

640
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.500
Thresh and destroy the Nations who attacked Jerusalem.

641
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.300
They want to desecrate Zion and loot its Temple, but

642
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.500
Zion will end up consecrating the enemy's wealth

643
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.000
to God.

644
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.400
Like God was turning weakness into strength. We saw that here. He's

645
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.200
turning this threat into victory.

646
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.000
He flipped it on him. He said come on in. Come on in guys. Come on in.

647
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.600
Come to Jerusalem gather around.

648
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.500
for one purpose

649
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.400
which in fact if you go back and read Isaiah chapter 37, we

650
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.300
we seek God in part fulfill This Promise by

651
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:22.500
miraculously destroying 185,000 Assyrian

652
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.400
troops at one time.

653
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.900
They all gathered around Jerusalem and then goth

654
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.600
wipes out 185,000

655
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.600
So I know that there's a lot going on here and some of this is still future. There's

656
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.800
still things happening. But the overall point to this is that those who

657
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.700
arrogantly oppose God will not

658
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.000
have the last say

659
00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.200
They will be defeated.

660
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.300
That's the opposition they're facing and God says.

661
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.700
One day it will be complete.

662
00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.800
See, that's the picture that Micah was painting for us here. Is

663
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.300
that even if it seems like all hope is

664
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.000
lost.

665
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.700
Hope is actually still there.

666
00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.700
Hope is still present. How can we be so sure though.

667
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.100
Because manager looks like these enemies are going to take us out.

668
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.600
How can we be so sure that hopes still alive and

669
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.500
we're going to Exile for the next however, many like we don't know what's gonna

670
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.800
happen on the back end. How can we be so sure?

671
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.700
Because our God will win the battle.

672
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.300
He will show himself Victorious.

673
00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.100
They've seen Farmers threshing out the grain. They know what that looks

674
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.100
like and they see now that God will strengthen them and

675
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.700
God will strengthen us to overcome the enemy.

676
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.600
But again, it's not because we have any strength in ourselves. It's

677
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.600
because Jesus has overcome the world already.

678
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.300
See, this is the gospel. Hope we have just how this all

679
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.600
comes forward to us today.

680
00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.300
Because think about how dark it was.

681
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.600
When Jesus like chapter 5

682
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.100
verse 1 was being struck on the

683
00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.100
face with a rod by the religious leaders.

684
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.500
Think of how the darkness fell on the world as Jesus

685
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.600
is up on the cross for hours and darkness how

686
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.200
dark it was at that time. Think about how dark it

687
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.800
was for those three days when he was in the Tomb think

688
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.200
out life was dark in so many ways.

689
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.700
But Sunday's coming, right?

690
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.200
just think

691
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.600
of that glorious morning

692
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.700
when light burst out of the darkness when life

693
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.500
burst out of death

694
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.800
all hope had seemed lost all hope had seemed like

695
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.500
it was gone to the Wayside defeat seemed

696
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.500
inevitable. The enemy was laughing because he thought he

697
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.300
won at that time, but then it all turned around into Eternal

698
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.600
Victory through this Messiah named Jesus.

699
00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.800
that the threat

700
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.300
turned into victory

701
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.200
the very thing the enemy tried to do

702
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.300
to destroy the king actually brought victory for

703
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:08.700
the king.

704
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.300
And not only that first John 5 verse 4 says if

705
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.300
we trust in Jesus we share in that

706
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.100
Victory, too.

707
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.900
It's not just we're looking up here like congratulations clapping

708
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.300
for the king. We share in that

709
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.400
Victory as well. That's what the kingdom of God does

710
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:28.900
Church.

711
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.500
That threats may come threats trials will

712
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.400
be experienced and if we don't have any hope in those then

713
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.900
of course, there's every reason to give up.

714
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.100
Hope is the thing that people need right now, right?

715
00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.100
If we don't have any hope, let's just give up we might as well just throw in

716
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.500
the towel. We're done. Yeah, of course, it shouldn't last but

717
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.500
if we trust in him

718
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.500
if we trust in this King this Messiah the

719
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.200
Savior the Victor that means we have the

720
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.200
strength of his might in US.

721
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.000
That means that we are being shaped into

722
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.700
his character through all of it.

723
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.900
And that means that we have the Assurance of Victory

724
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.000
on the other side of this.

725
00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.300
That's why.

726
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.700
We have hope to carry on no matter what we face every

727
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:21.900
day.

728
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.000
We don't know when God's gonna bring all this to pass.

729
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:28.900
We just know he will.

730
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.800
So hold on Church.

731
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.300
Weeping may last through the night.

732
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.000
But joy comes with that morning.
