00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.800
Well, Happy New Year Church. Welcome to

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.900
2023 and this Gathering of

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.800
Henderson Hills Baptist Church.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.300
My coach used to say when we were watching film

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.300
in the dark late and early and all

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.600
that. He says it he'd rather have you standing than sleeping? So

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.100
if you stayed up too late last night, feel free to go to

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.400
the edges or the back and stand up to stay awake. I get that Rob.

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.500
So if you're new to our church, we're grateful

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.100
that you're here. We're thankful that we

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.300
get to have such a joyous occasion to

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.600
celebrate kick off a new year. We want to get to know you. Maybe you're

13
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.800
coming off a Christmas Eve and you're here and maybe you're trying to

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.300
start a new Rhythm this year. However that looks for you either

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.300
way. We want to know you and help you. However, we

16
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.300
can there's a QR code and seat in front of you or just come talk to one

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.400
of us today the big desk out there one of us up here. We'd

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.300
love to just to meet you and get to know you that way

19
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.100
but as we look ahead and look at all the

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.300
unknowns and all the uncertainties and all the possibilities of

21
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
a new year ahead of us. I have this small slip of

22
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.300
paper here. It's torn off of a larger sheet, of course,

23
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.400
and I don't remember the whole context of why I wrote or what paper

24
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.200
On this all of that but it sits on my desk.

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.000
It's right underneath my monitor. I see it all the time when I'm writing sermons

26
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.100
and you're gonna see a picture of it because you can't see this of course,

27
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.500
but I've talked about this before over the last couple years, but

28
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.900
here's what it says in my chicken scratch handwriting

29
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.300
here on it. I wrote in pencil it

30
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.100
says a question.

31
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.600
It says when will we get desperate for

32
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.900
him?

33
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.600
When will we get desperate for him?

34
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.400
Speaking for myself. It was like, when will I

35
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.400
stop being so self-reliant?

36
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.700
And in fact, there's a word underneath it. The word

37
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.200
is broken.

38
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.600
That's the idea behind whatever I was

39
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.700
writing this meeting in. I don't know what it was. But

40
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.000
but I know the date because up in the

41
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.700
top right corner, very small up there. I dated it.

42
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.900
And it's three ten twenty twenty.

43
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.400
Little did I know what was coming the very next day

44
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.100
March 11th of 2020 which

45
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.700
was the night the Thunder game got derailed because

46
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.500
one of the opposing players got covid and they began to postpone

47
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.200
everything and and all the cancellations began to happen

48
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.500
including that weekend for our church where

49
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.600
we hadn't been online at all, but then we go completely online

50
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.900
for two and a half months.

51
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.700
We were affected by it as well. Now wherever

52
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.100
you stand in all those issues I get there's debate in

53
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.600
that but

54
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.400
but no one can deny that the day after

55
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.800
me asking the question of myself. When

56
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.100
will we get desperate for him?

57
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.200
Our Lives fundamentally changed because of

58
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.800
covid

59
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.000
it's like God was stripping away everything

60
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.800
that we had been relying on.

61
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.400
like

62
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.700
finances jobs entertainment

63
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.300
Comforts God was stripping it all away

64
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.400
and was revealing our need for

65
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.600
him.

66
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.500
He did it even more deeply in me personally.

67
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.300
A year later when I was dealing with crippling vertigo for

68
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.900
a couple months and even at that moment for

69
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.700
that stretch wondering if I'm ever going to be able to function again.

70
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800
But God does that.

71
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.300
at times in our lives

72
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.800
He might use nature.

73
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.700
or sorrow

74
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.500
or other common occurrences in our lives to shake us

75
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.700
up.

76
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.500
to awaken us from our spiritual stupor

77
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.700
to challenge and confront our laziness. He brings

78
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.400
things or allows things into our lives.

79
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.700
Yet as we'll see today. He does it all.

80
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.500
to draw us nearer to him

81
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.600
Any of it all of it is to draw us nearer and

82
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.000
closer to him.

83
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.500
Because we were made to be dependent on him.

84
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.600
We so often forget that and we we

85
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.200
start to to think we're self-made that

86
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.400
we can handle it. All we can do what we need to do. We can make this thing happen.

87
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.500
We forget that we were made to be dependent on

88
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.800
him.

89
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.700
And that's who we want to be.

90
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.900
Around here as a church as individuals as families, we want to be dependent

91
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.700
like that. In fact, one of our churches values

92
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.500
the things that we hold tightly to is called

93
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.900
desperate dependence.

94
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.300
And it's from that season like it. It's directly tied in

95
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.800
my brain and in our hearts as Elders back to covid and

96
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.200
in my vertigo, it's tied to that

97
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.300
desperate dependence where instead of thinking that we can

98
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.100
do it all ourselves like our programs and

99
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.300
our skills. We put it all in the right formula It's Gonna Change

100
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.100
lives. No the way we say it is we rely on

101
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.200
the Holy Spirit to empower our lives and our church

102
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.800
as we humbly abide in Jesus recognizing we

103
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.200
can do nothing apart from him.

104
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.000
That's one of our core values.

105
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.700
Which is why we felt led to start 2023.

106
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.600
With this that we're kind of loosely calling a solemn

107
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.600
assembly today.

108
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.500
Realigning our hearts to God's

109
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.700
ways and expressing our dependence upon him.

110
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.100
Where we're not just going to talk about it. We're going to

111
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.400
practice that we're gonna actually do some things and hopefully get us to

112
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.500
that.

113
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.400
Desperate dependence leads us to today but it's also why we're starting off

114
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.200
the week of 2020 this first week of 2023 with

115
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.300
what we're calling a week of prayer very creatively, but

116
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.500
but a week of prayer.

117
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.100
Where we're going to be praying separately on our own

118
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.000
of course, but then also a couple times together.

119
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.600
Depending on the Lord.

120
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.200
Gathering to say God we need you we can do

121
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.400
nothing apart from you and I'll explain more about both today

122
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.200
and this week as we go forward, but we need to see

123
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.700
it in God's word. And so take your copy of God's word. Turn with me to the

124
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.500
Book of Joel.

125
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500
We're going to be today in Joel chapter 2.

126
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.100
Joel is in the Old Testament really if you were here

127
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.400
the fall we were in Micah just a few pages left from there.

128
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.300
You'll find the Book of Joel short

129
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.800
little book there.

130
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.500
now as you turn there, I'm not going to do a deep dive into the overall of

131
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.000
Joel today because

132
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.200
at the beginning of my regularly scheduled sabbatical coming up

133
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.400
in April Heath Thomas is going to come and

134
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.500
he is going to he's an expert on the prophets which

135
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.500
Joel's a profit. He's an expert he's going to do a deep dive

136
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.300
into the Book of Joel for the first five weeks of my

137
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.500
sabbatical where he's gonna preach through this whole book

138
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.300
so you can look forward to that. We're just going to touch on it a

139
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.500
little bit today and for our purposes what we need to understand.

140
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.200
About Joel he was a prophet

141
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.400
similar to Micah. He spoke on behalf of God to his

142
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.500
people.

143
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.700
And in all the prophets there were warnings of judgment to

144
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.600
come as they turned away from God, but there

145
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.200
were also Promises of restoration if they

146
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.200
returned to God that's in every one of the prophets. You see that

147
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.000
back and forth.

148
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.800
But Joel's context specifically.

149
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.400
Was he was saying what he's saying here in the Book of Joel immediately

150
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.600
after God had sent a

151
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.200
swarm of locusts.

152
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.000
to judge his people

153
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.000
Now we might only know the word Locust from like Charlton

154
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.500
Heston 10 commandments the plague

155
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.400
it's one of the plagues.

156
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.700
Kids, here's a way to think about it like bugs life the enemy grasshoppers.

157
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.400
That's kind of what a locust is. And so think look like

158
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.300
they're gonna eat stuff and that's what they did. God sent this swarm Army

159
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.900
of locusts and they ate everything all

160
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.300
the trees grain Vineyards. All of

161
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.100
it was gone, which means they had no food and they had no prospects of

162
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.400
food.

163
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.200
That was the Judgment God brought on his people. They had

164
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.800
turned away from him to follow these false gods

165
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.400
and they had sinful thoughts and actions and

166
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.100
so God disciplined his people.

167
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:22.800
Yet.

168
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.400
through Joel

169
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.700
God offered the promise of restoration if

170
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.000
they would return to him.

171
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.300
If they turned back, but but he he offers that

172
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.400
yet still through Joel. He says actually there's

173
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.300
a worse disaster coming. There's

174
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.600
total Destruction coming if you continue down this path, I'm

175
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.900
gonna send an army not of locust but of people to completely

176
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.700
destroy your land.

177
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.400
And eventually we see in the history. That's what

178
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.800
happened.

179
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.700
But for this opportunity this moment in time

180
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.700
for Judah they had the opportunity to see

181
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.200
which way they were going to go.

182
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.300
Now here's what we can't do with this. I said this back with Micah we

183
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.200
can't make a one-to-one comparison here.

184
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.300
With with God blessing our land like this.

185
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.700
So if we if we return to the Lord as his people God's

186
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.200
Gonna Bless America, no that it's not the same because we're not

187
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.200
a Theocratic nation state living in God's

188
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.600
Promised Land like they were

189
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.400
so this is not the kingdom here. So if we

190
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.300
repent God's not necessarily going to bless our land,

191
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.200
but what we do need to see here.

192
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.400
This is what Joel's instructive for us.

193
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.400
We need to see why God was saying this

194
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.200
to his people.

195
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.500
Why was God doing the things here and saying these

196
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.000
things to his people and how were they supposed to

197
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.100
respond to it?

198
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.100
Because the one thing we can relate to is being God's people

199
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.100
as Christians.

200
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.900
How should we respond to what God says here and

201
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.500
seeing that will lead us then

202
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.800
to think more christianly about events in

203
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.400
the world events in our lives.

204
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.300
As we lift our eyes to the Sovereign god of the

205
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:12.900
universe.

206
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.200
And so we'll see here. Look now at Joel 2

207
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.000
starting in verse 12 down through verse 17.

208
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.200
That's big number two little number 12 underneath that and we're going

209
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.500
to see what God Said to his people how they were to respond as

210
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.500
we reflect on our response to the things in

211
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.300
our lives today.

212
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.200
Yet even now declares the Lord.

213
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.700
Return to me with all your heart.

214
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.300
With fasting with weeping and with Mourning.

215
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.300
And rind or tear your hearts and not your

216
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:46.600
garments.

217
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.400
Return to the Lord your God for his gracious and merciful slow

218
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.400
to anger abounding in steadfast

219
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:54.600
love.

220
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.000
And he relents over disaster.

221
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.500
Who knows whether he will not turn and relent and leave a blessing behind him

222
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.400
a grain offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God.

223
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.500
Blow the trumpet in Zion consecrate a fast

224
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.700
call a solemn assembly.

225
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.100
Gather the people consecrate the congregation assemble.

226
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.500
The elders gathered the children even nursing

227
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:18.900
infants.

228
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.400
Let the bridegroom leave his room let the bride leave

229
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.200
her chamber.

230
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.200
between the vestibule and the altar let the priests the Ministers of

231
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.400
the Lord weep and say

232
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.900
spare your people O Lord

233
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.700
and make not your heritage a reproach a byword

234
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.700
among the Nations.

235
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.600
Why should they say among the peoples? Where is

236
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.200
their God?

237
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.800
Lord help us understand

238
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.300
help us to see what you want us to see that our

239
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.400
eyes are ears. Our hearts would be open to be good soil for

240
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:52.500
the

241
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.200
The seed of your word the seed of the Gospel to

242
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.600
plant and bear good fruit help us to see it. Holy

243
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.000
spirit Empower us to respond as you

244
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.600
want us to respond For Your Glory.

245
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.700
In Jesus name amen.

246
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.900
So I've already kind of alluded to this but the first point that the disaster that

247
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.700
we would experience should first summon us

248
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.200
to the Lord.

249
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.600
That's the point we see here is that they've experienced this

250
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.200
utter disaster?

251
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.200
The Locust eating everything watched their first

252
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.300
response. It should be to summon to the Lord to

253
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.200
come to the Lord this Gathering of people.

254
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.400
We see here right similar to what we're doing today. It was all

255
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.700
the people it was older to younger. It was Elders. It

256
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.400
was babies. It was everybody. That's how serious this

257
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.900
was because of the things that had been happening.

258
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.600
They called it a solemn assembly a heavy

259
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.200
weighted Gathering of people. Like there was

260
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.300
a seriousness to this thing. It wasn't just a party. It was

261
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.300
something they took serious and Joel here.

262
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.500
He piles up the imperatives to emphasize the

263
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.900
urgency of this situation.

264
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.700
Even to the point where he tells a bride

265
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.300
and a groom that they better leave their wedding so that they come

266
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.200
like that's that's a big deal. Go tell the bride at

267
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.400
that wedding. You're coming to next week, right? Hey, you need to stop and

268
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.100
you need to go to church right? Like that's not gonna work.

269
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.500
But that's how serious this was.

270
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.100
And notice why in verse 12,

271
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.200
God said he wanted his people back.

272
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.300
They had turned away from him. They turned away from his Covenant

273
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.200
Love. They had wandered walked their own way. And

274
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.200
so he says return to me.

275
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.100
Even now he says there's a urgency to the

276
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.300
verse 12 like even now don't wait. Don't wait

277
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.800
till next week. Don't wait till you get married now return to

278
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.100
me.

279
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.900
see our natural response

280
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.500
may be to run away from the Lord when things are hard.

281
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.100
To question his goodness.

282
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.300
To run and try to hide from him. You've seen

283
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.200
it. We've all done this our kids all the time when

284
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.800
you were a kid, right you you know, you did something wrong.

285
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.500
You're a natural reaction wasn't probably to go. Tell your parents.

286
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.500
Hey, I broke the vase right like it. Wasn't that you

287
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.400
ran and hit.

288
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.500
Because you were afraid of what could happen the authority figure

289
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.500
you didn't want to confront that and so that's not natural to

290
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.800
us. But but what God wants for

291
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.100
us. It's for us to draw near to him

292
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.000
in that he wants us to pull to him because

293
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.200
he draws near he draws

294
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.800
near to us.

295
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.200
He says he draws near Psalm 34 to the Brokenhearted.

296
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.600
When we're broken over something in our lives, he draws near to

297
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.800
that and so I want you to hear this today, whatever you feel.

298
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.200
Whatever you carried the weight of 2022 into this year

299
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.700
and you're looking ahead with with Dread not with excitement and

300
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.200
you're feeling like man this whole thing's a

301
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.700
mess right now. Whatever you feel he wants

302
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.700
you close.

303
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.300
He doesn't want you to drift. He doesn't want you to walk away to doubt. He

304
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.000
wants you close. He wants you to draw near and Pull near.

305
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.600
No matter what your facing.

306
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.500
But I keep talking about this disaster.

307
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.600
What's that even mean? Like what does that word? Well, it's

308
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.800
the Hebrew word Raha which actually means evil

309
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.200
in some cases, but here it means

310
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.100
calamity.

311
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.600
adversity

312
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.900
hardship, we might say

313
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.400
now as I say that you might not be

314
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.200
thinking that you are going through a disaster right now.

315
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.300
Like you look at this and you think well, certainly not the level

316
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.300
of locust eating everything like for Judah. I'm not going through it.

317
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.700
Like that's pretty good right now life's pretty smooth sailing.

318
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.100
I think everything is great.

319
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.200
The problem with that is is I know this in my life and

320
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.700
you as well like in that that moment those seasons

321
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.200
of life, we default to self-sufficiency really

322
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.900
quickly, don't we?

323
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.100
Everything's good.

324
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.200
I don't really need God. I got this dangerous place

325
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.900
to be right.

326
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.100
But here's what we need to see any hardship.

327
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.700
Whether you perceive it to be large or small, you know, it's like these massive things

328
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.500
disasters like this or or even small things

329
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.400
any any speed bump hiccup anything

330
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.500
that chinks the armor in our lives and cause us

331
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.000
to step back and think a little bit any of those hardships

332
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.600
should be seen as a prompt to

333
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.800
draw near to the Lord.

334
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.700
It should be just this trigger.

335
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.500
like, oh I'm reminded again to draw

336
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.200
near to pull towards him not to run away not

337
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.300
to drift away but to be pulling near and now

338
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.900
this adversity we're talking about this disaster can be

339
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.200
just because we live in a fallen world.

340
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.600
Just because we live in this broken place.

341
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.400
It's not the way it's supposed to be in you might say it this way things that

342
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.800
aren't your fault their quotes, right?

343
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.200
This is this is stuff that happens when the virus

344
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.400
comes or a war happens or or someone else does

345
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.200
something to you, right? That's that's adversity in

346
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.000
your life that you had really nothing to do with and it just

347
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.000
happens to you because of sin in the world.

348
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.700
It can be that kind of adversity lose a job. You see these sorts

349
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.100
of things.

350
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:35.900
Trip us up.

351
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.400
But there can be other adversity that will come in your life because

352
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.900
of your own sinful decisions and actions.

353
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.800
You reap what you sow you pay the consequence.

354
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.100
for sinning

355
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.400
for walking down this road. That's not God ordained and

356
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.300
you pay the price and you experience hardship in

357
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.900
your life and it's adversity.

358
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.200
Yes, it happens.

359
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.500
Our first reaction to either of those but especially

360
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.300
the second one should not be like Adam and

361
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:10.700
Eve in the garden.

362
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.400
Where we try to hide from God and run away from

363
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:15.700
him.

364
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.300
We should instead draw near to him not like the little kid running

365
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.500
away from mom like you draw near to him, but

366
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.500
that's the shift we have to make because that's not natural

367
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.000
to us.

368
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.100
Here's the only way that's going to work.

369
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.300
The only way you could ever Pull near to God like to

370
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.000
the authority to run to mom when you break the vase instead of

371
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.200
running away. The only way you can do that is because of his character.

372
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.500
Did you see it in verse 13?

373
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.200
Return to the like sin. It's remember who he's

374
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.800
talking to here.

375
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.300
He's talking to people who have worshiped Idols sacrifice

376
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.400
to these false gods done all kinds

377
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.400
of evil stuff. He says return to

378
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.900
the Lord your God come back.

379
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.600
Don't clean yourself up before you come just come.

380
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.400
Because that word for means because

381
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.400
he is gracious.

382
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.700
and merciful

383
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.300
slow to anger abounding instead

384
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.100
fast, love.

385
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.900
I was thinking about the the parable of the Prodigal Son.

386
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.600
God's the father in that right? The parable is

387
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.300
not necessarily about the sons.

388
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.400
The parable is about the father in his heart first and

389
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:36.700
foremost.

390
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:38.800
because the father

391
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.000
No, remember he saw him coming from a long

392
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:43.400
way off.

393
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.300
Which means he was watching for him to come

394
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.100
back which means he was sitting there ready?

395
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:51.600
Ready?

396
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.500
For that sun to come back.

397
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.700
anticipating him coming back

398
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.400
And so that's the heart of the father. But but you have to think now

399
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.400
about the sun think about that son who goes to a far-off

400
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.500
country wastes all of his fathers inheritance. He

401
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.700
spins it on all kinds of sinful junk like this whole

402
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.300
scene would be right. He's wasted it

403
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.900
all he's lost it all.

404
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.300
The only way he's going to come back.

405
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.400
Is because he knows his father's good.

406
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.600
He has every reason to stay and to run away and stay

407
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.200
lost and to be out there and and yet he

408
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.500
comes back because he knows his father is

409
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.500
good and has his good for him. Now. He doesn't believe he's

410
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.500
going to accept him, right?

411
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.800
But he still says I that's my best option.

412
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.300
And so he comes back and the father runs to him and Embraces him

413
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.300
and brings him in kills the fatted calf the whole party all of

414
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:49.400
that.

415
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.400
He only comes back. You will only run to

416
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.500
God when you sin if you see him

417
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.500
as gracious and merciful slow to

418
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.200
anger and abounding in love for you.

419
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.400
You've got to see that.

420
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.500
But then you have to think. Okay. Well.

421
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.300
All right. I got that.

422
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.100
I need to come back.

423
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:13.700
how

424
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.100
how could I ever come back?

425
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.300
How should we come back? How do we when we recognize that we

426
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.000
have drifted?

427
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.000
When we have gotten complacent we've forgotten

428
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.300
that he is our first love that

429
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.800
he's priority number one, and we've we've made everything else. How do

430
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.300
we come back?

431
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.500
How should we come back? Well first clearly we

432
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.000
see it here repent.

433
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.300
repent

434
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.500
that's the image we get here from verse 12. God says return to

435
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:51.700
him.

436
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.500
with all your heart

437
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.600
with weeping

438
00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.400
Mourning

439
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.400
He says rind or tear your hearts, not your

440
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:04.900
garments.

441
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.600
Now like what does that even mean? Why are we ripping clothes? Well back

442
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:10.900
then.

443
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.400
There was when there was extreme grief over something.

444
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.100
They would often symbolically tear their

445
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.200
clothes like literally taking their shirt and ripping it and

446
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.500
all open.

447
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.200
They would tear their clothes. They would cry out in anguish. They would

448
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.700
even throw ashes on their head at times all because they

449
00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.800
were showing Brokenness.

450
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.000
But notice God says here. He doesn't just want an external display

451
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.400
of supposed repentance because

452
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.600
anybody can tear your clothes like you can throw ashes

453
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.300
on your head and you can do everything you're supposed to do and your heart

454
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.200
is completely Wicked.

455
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.300
What he says here is he wants our hearts?

456
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.200
He wants inward change before external change.

457
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.700
Because their their sin had caused such deep separation

458
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.500
from God it had brought separation from him. It

459
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.200
had brought disaster on their land. And so God says you better

460
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.000
grieve that you should grieve your sin.

461
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.200
I wonder have you ever felt.

462
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.400
that kind of weight

463
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.500
over your own sinful actions

464
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.700
like have you ever felt?

465
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.400
So horribly about your sin

466
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.900
that it almost makes you sick physically.

467
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.300
Or or weeping you're crying

468
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.600
because of what you've done not because of the effects or the consequences,

469
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.700
but because you have sinned against God.

470
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.100
That's what he says. You should feel we should feel.

471
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.700
Because that hurt was to be so profound their hearts changed.

472
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.600
Because that's where true transformation lies, right?

473
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.200
Anybody can modify behavior for a little while?

474
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.300
You can teach a wild animal how to do certain things

475
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.400
if you give enough treats.

476
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.700
You can you can manage Behavior you can do enough for

477
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.900
a while, but true transformation lasting

478
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.700
change.

479
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.800
Comes from what second Corinthians 7:10 calls Godly grief.

480
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.300
Different than worldly grief, it's Godly grief. Not

481
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.100
just apologizing to God.

482
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.700
It's true deep grief over sin.

483
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.800
Because how many times we've all had this we've all done it probably you do

484
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.700
something. You say I'm sorry.

485
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.300
And you do it again.

486
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.700
Sorry do it again. Sorry do it again and it's hundreds of

487
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.200
those right?

488
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.300
Is that sorry really genuine?

489
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.200
Not really, right. So so what we're talking about is

490
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.800
this true sorrow over sin. That's what produces Earnest

491
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.200
action because we're not just talking about sorrow. We're talking

492
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:54.900
about steps.

493
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.100
There's action to it.

494
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.300
I read somebody say it this way like it's one thing

495
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.300
to get woken up at 5 am.

496
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.800
It's a whole other thing to get out of bed at 5 am.

497
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.500
Right, you understand that like you get woken to me like yeah, I did

498
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:12.900
mess up.

499
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.400
Right. No you get up and do something about

500
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.800
it. That's what we're talking about with repentance.

501
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.000
That's what God's discipline is meant to bring in our lives.

502
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.600
That we awaken to where our sin is leading us where we repent from

503
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.600
that we turn from it and we change.

504
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.200
And that's that's primarily for whenever the disaster in your life is because

505
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.400
your own doing your own sin, which is majority. But

506
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.800
even if the disaster were experiencing is not

507
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.200
Directly tied to our own sin.

508
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.400
It's crisis in the world. It's something happening to you. Even

509
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.500
if it's not your fault, so to speak God

510
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.900
still wants to use it to refocus our hearts.

511
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.000
Crisis reveals stuff it just it just puts

512
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.200
you in different place. You look at it from a different angle all the sudden and it

513
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.600
shows you something shows you weak points. It

514
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.700
gives you the opportunity to pray what Psalm 139:23

515
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.900
and 24 says search me.

516
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.600
Oh God and know my heart.

517
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.300
Try me know my thoughts see if

518
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.900
there's any Grievous way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting.

519
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.000
What a great prayer, right and listen, all you wonder

520
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.800
if God answers prayers. He'll answer that prayer.

521
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.200
And whatever he shows you then you lay before him and repentance.

522
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.700
Knowing he's gonna forgive you.

523
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.900
Remember the character of God.

524
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.100
He's gracious and merciful slow to anger abounding in

525
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.900
love. He's he's proven that here this proven that

526
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.600
in Jesus taking the final

527
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.800
disaster the worst disaster death. He's

528
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.900
taken that on the cross paid for it and defeated

529
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.500
it. So what fear do we have to bring

530
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.100
these things before him now?

531
00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.900
We should come with joy.

532
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.000
I've blown it. I've walked away. I've been

533
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.400
selfish. I've been prideful God take this

534
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.200
away from me. I know you already have forgiven me for it.

535
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.400
Change me make me different because I want fellowship with

536
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.000
you. I want Purity in my life. I want to be a

537
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.300
good example of Christ likeness to the world around me. God

538
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.400
changed me. We should do that with joy not running

539
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.500
away and hiding.

540
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.500
Bring your stuff to him bring the sin to him

541
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.900
and he will forgive you.

542
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.800
So he brings us to him in these disaster like

543
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.300
moments to repent first and foremost.

544
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.600
But he adds a couple things in this summons in verse 12.

545
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.700
He says that we should respond with fasting.

546
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.600
to these calamities

547
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.300
we respond we draw near to the

548
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.200
Lord in fasting.

549
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.300
Now here's what we often do with fasting in our day.

550
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.100
We don't talk about a whole lot. We don't do it a lot.

551
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.500
but what it can turn into is some kind of like spiritual Eagle

552
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.800
Scout award that only the super serious

553
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.300
Christians do and everybody else is like lower level lower

554
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.800
class like you if you're serious about you you fast or

555
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.000
you fast man you are serious about

556
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.400
Don't forget that Jesus said nobody's supposed to know you're doing

557
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:33.600
it.

558
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.200
So don't use it. It's like a spiritual badge of honor that

559
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.800
you are a fasting person. Like that's that's missing the

560
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.000
point.

561
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.200
But it's clearly important here in Joel.

562
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.800
And it's all over the Old Testament that God's people fasted when

563
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.400
they felt desperate before the Lord.

564
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.000
And notice this was a public fast

565
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.900
a call for a public fast. There

566
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.300
was many others all throughout they're even days of

567
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.200
the year that they would fast. So they so we're not saying that you

568
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.300
can't ever talk about the fasting.

569
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.900
What Jesus was saying is that you don't walk around looking

570
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.700
like you're more spiritual by the way, you're so

571
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.400
tired and hungry because you're fasting no he's

572
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.200
saying just live your life normally, but he doesn't say you

573
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.500
can't fast together because of desperation before

574
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:23.900
the Lord.

575
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.600
People fasted when they were in trouble and they recognized their

576
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.400
Drift from the Lord individually, but then the group as a

577
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.800
whole the nation would come together. It's even when they needed direction

578
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.400
from the Lord.

579
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.700
Which is picked up in the New Testament by the way, Jesus.

580
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.300
And the early church leadership asking God

581
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.900
for direction and who should go they fasted and

582
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.000
they prayed and they set apart Paul and Barnabas.

583
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.500
So this is part of it.

584
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.700
It shows desperation. It shows dependence asking

585
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.300
God even if it's not directly tied to your own sin. It's still

586
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.200
an expression of desperate dependence.

587
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.100
That we're trying to be about around here.

588
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:07.500
so

589
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.500
we are calling for a fast.

590
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.100
Friday

591
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.300
At least from lunch.

592
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.800
But there's no formula. There's no like fixed way

593
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.900
to do this. So if it's modified for you medically or

594
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.600
something else that you see would be more helpful like

595
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.200
just whatever.

596
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.000
but at least

597
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.100
Friday lunch for some who would choose to do that.

598
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.400
Take that time. You'd normally be a normal human

599
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.100
function of eating you take that time and set it aside

600
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.600
for prayer and for devotion focus on the Lord.

601
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.800
that as you feel the physical hunger

602
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.700
it reminds you of the spiritual hunger that's always there.

603
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.100
That we mask with so many other things.

604
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.500
And so we're gonna do that separately. Of

605
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.200
course as we're walking through life and if

606
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.400
you're able then one way we're going to gather at that time. Is

607
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.300
that on Facebook or Facebook page for

608
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.400
our church at noon Joe and I are going to be live streaming

609
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.200
a time of prayer and praise because often fasting

610
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.600
is tied with prayer very directly.

611
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.300
And it's a corporate thing. We can't all gather at noon

612
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.500
together. And so we're going to do it on Facebook. It's kind

613
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.600
of like what we did back in the early days the pandemic midday 20s,

614
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.600
we would live stream those interactive with people praying

615
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.300
through some things on our Facebook page. We're going to do something like that

616
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.200
again just to focus our hearts and Minds

617
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.000
on seeking God that Friday.

618
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.800
But let me just challenge you beyond Friday.

619
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.000
That's one thing and we can do that. Okay, great, but

620
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.300
But beyond that consider how to draw near to

621
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.900
the Lord yourself personally.

622
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.400
Like regularly making this a rhythm somehow using

623
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.300
fasting in your life to just expose your own

624
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.400
heart and to express your dependence on God figure out ways

625
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.300
to make that happen.

626
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.600
It's one way not the only way it's one way to

627
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.200
draw near.

628
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.900
There's one more though here in Joel 2 of this invitation

629
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.500
to return one more action. It's what

630
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.400
the whole next week's going to be centered on. It's prayer.

631
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.600
repent fast pray

632
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.200
They are summoned here to pray.

633
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.500
It's all over what is said to the people in 12

634
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.100
13 14. It's explicit in verse

635
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.100
17 for the priests as they stand between the vestibule and the

636
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.800
alter meaning in the temple grounds kind of as a go between within

637
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.300
people and God they were to pray that God

638
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.600
would relent. They it's kind of like Moses for the people and exodus this

639
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.600
this kind of idea, but it's all about prayer where

640
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.500
they're crying out to the Lord to change their

641
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.500
situation to overcome their enemies to fix their

642
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.400
hearts to bless them again.

643
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.600
Notice, this is a prayer not just for their needs prayer

644
00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.700
for the problems in their life the pains

645
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.500
and their legs, right? It's not just prayer for that. It's broken dependence

646
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.900
on the lord. It's desperate dependence

647
00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.200
for God to move.

648
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.300
But that's what a crisis does right.

649
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.300
Think about how your prayers change when you get that phone call from

650
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:17.700
the doctor.

651
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.600
Like that morning list, you're praying for this this this this you get

652
00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.700
the phone call from doctor. It's a whole different ballgame.

653
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.800
And you are diving in you're a focused and you're one one

654
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.200
track.

655
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.300
dependence on the Lord

656
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.700
It's not just for your own Comfort anymore. It's for this when you're when your

657
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.400
family member struggles or when this happens you you start praying

658
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.200
differently. It's why the church in Acts

659
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.600
was devoted to prayer.

660
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.400
Because they felt the crisis they felt the threat of

661
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.600
people potentially coming after them to kill them.

662
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.100
Church in Acts also understood that the task Jesus

663
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.500
left for them was so far

664
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.800
beyond themselves. There's no way they could do with him.

665
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.300
They needed him like God you tell us we're gonna go to the ends of

666
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.100
the Earth with this thing.

667
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.200
We don't even know like 20 miles out from here

668
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.800
and you're telling us the ends of the Earth.

669
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:13.500
God you got to do this.

670
00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.700
There's no way we can do this on our

671
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.000
God you have to work.

672
00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.200
David Platt said that the early church.

673
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.300
For there for them the early church prayer was

674
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:30.900
fundamental.

675
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.600
Well today in our churches. We've made it supplemental.

676
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.500
We can do this. We got it. Oh, yeah, God, could you bless our plans,

677
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:41.700
please?

678
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.400
God

679
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.100
we finally hit the end of our rope. Can you take care of this

680
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:49.500
for us?

681
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.900
So here in a moment, we're going to pray.

682
00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:58.800
with that in mind

683
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.300
But also during this week of prayer.

684
00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.200
You can see it on your notes or in the app. If you're using that

685
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.000
their prayer Points each day to pray for.

686
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.700
We'll put social media posts up about them every day. You'll get

687
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.400
it maybe even got one this morning from us. If you have the app about

688
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.700
a notification to pray today for certain things right get

689
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.100
one every day this week.

690
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.900
And this is just as a way for all of us to knock on the door of Heaven asking God

691
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:25.800
to do what only he can do.

692
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.400
depending on him for him to move for him

693
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.200
to do things only he can take the credit for

694
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.600
and so we're gonna pray separately. We're gonna focus our hearts devote ourselves

695
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.700
to prayer but also,

696
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.000
on Wednesday morning

697
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:40.800
6 am

698
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.700
down in student room one which is down the hallway that direction there's

699
00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.700
entrances around it.

700
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.400
We're going to be gathering again to pray.

701
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.000
At our church in Fort Worth. We had refugees that were from the

702
00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.300
middle of Africa. We have Afghan refugees here, and we have a few others, but

703
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.800
but from like the Congo area Burundi they

704
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.900
ended up in Fort Worth.

705
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.400
And they showed up and one of them was a church planter.

706
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.100
And we were talking in first week. They were there. He's like oh so so

707
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.500
when do you pray?

708
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.200
Like as a church I said, well, you know, we're we're making a

709
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.300
step forward in our time of gathering and we're praying and services more than

710
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.200
we do and and we're trying to as Elders pray better

711
00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.600
and he's like no. No, when do you pray?

712
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.500
It's like what do you mean? It's like no one's your prayer meeting.

713
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.400
I said well we don't have one.

714
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:36.900
He said well.

715
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.300
And he started laying out that they would meet multiple times

716
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:40.900
a week.

717
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.400
To pray just not not preaching not singing nothing just

718
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.700
to devote to the Lord.

719
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.000
And we wonder why God is moving in such immense ways

720
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.400
around the world other places.

721
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.300
Planting churches. He planted two churches in his home country

722
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.600
five churches in refugee camp.

723
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.400
Like okay gosh.

724
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.800
supplemental right

725
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.900
So we're going to gather we're going to pray Focus time.

726
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.700
Because we want God to do what only he can take the credit for.

727
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.100
We don't want to do what things that we can do that by

728
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.200
our skill and our ability our money we can make

729
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:23.700
happen.

730
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.000
It's not what we want.

731
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.400
We want God to do what only he can take because then

732
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.400
he gets the glory for it not us.

733
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.100
If you can't make it at 6am on Wednesday pray, we are if you

734
00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:40.000
can only make it for 20 minutes of it come for 20 minutes. If you only make it for 40 or

735
00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.000
10, whatever just be praying that God

736
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.400
would move.

737
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.700
But again this notice Joel 2 was the

738
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.100
people's response to disaster.

739
00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.500
God called them to return back to him and they

740
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.000
showed their heart changed through repentance through fasting through

741
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.500
prayer.

742
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.300
And notice verse 14. They didn't know if God was going to change the situation

743
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:04.600
or not.

744
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.400
Who knows whether God's gonna turn a who knows whether this

745
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.300
cut this enemy nation's gonna take us over. We don't know if God's

746
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.700
Gonna spare us from that. We don't know.

747
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:16.900
We don't know either.

748
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.100
You don't know.

749
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.100
Well, God, take away that cancer. Well God fix that marriage. We don't know.

750
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.200
We pray that he will we pray in faith that he will.

751
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.000
But only God knows his Sovereign plan.

752
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.100
But because we do know that he loves us.

753
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.200
That he has good in store for his children who love him

754
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.000
and are called according to his purpose then that means we can surrender to

755
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.400
him and to his plan.

756
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.700
following him expressing dependence on him

757
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.200
in Practical real ways

758
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.300
That's what this is all about.

759
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.300
But here's a sad thing that I know happens in my heart.

760
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.600
when I face hardships

761
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.300
Maybe this happens to you as well.

762
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.300
when something comes up

763
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.600
triggering that hardship that speed bump that crisis that

764
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.400
disaster whatever it is.

765
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.200
I get really myopic and what I mean by that

766
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.700
is tunnel vision.

767
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.500
Like you're looking through a tube and it's one thing. That's all

768
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.300
it is that one issue that one crisis. It's

769
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.900
all about everything about that.

770
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.100
And you completely forget everything else around you

771
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.100
it becomes all about that.

772
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:34.200
And so yes.

773
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.200
Yes disasters meant to draw us back to the

774
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.200
Lord but hardship and struggle should

775
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.500
also direct us to the Future.

776
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:51.100
Like it's so easy to get locked in and forget everything

777
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.600
else including what's coming. We cannot

778
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.000
forget what's coming as well.

779
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.900
Did you see the end of verse 17 here?

780
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.500
That because of what Judah was going through other people

781
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.100
and other nations were doubting whether Yahweh was even real.

782
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.900
Right. Did you see that? Where is there God?

783
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.200
Has God not abandoned them. I mean they say they believe

784
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.200
in this Yahweh who provides for them, but is he even real I mean

785
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.300
look at they just got all these locusts eaten everything.

786
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.000
They become a byword which means like a laughing stock.

787
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:28.900
Is God even real?

788
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.500
Isn't it true that when you are going through the fire?

789
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.200
You might be tempted to think the same

790
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:41.500
thing.

791
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.500
God are you really good?

792
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.100
God look at what I'm going through. Are you even there?

793
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.000
I don't feel you.

794
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.500
All I feel is Carnage and pain.

795
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.300
It looks like you're not in control.

796
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.300
That's why we cannot forget our Eternal perspective.

797
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.100
See even in the Book of Joel in most of the prophets. There's this look to the

798
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.400
Future.

799
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.000
It's to this day of the Lord they call it.

800
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.600
It's to where God is going to judge his enemies fully

801
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.100
and finally and he's going to bless his people fully and finally and

802
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.800
everything's gonna be made right the Messiah comes and full form

803
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.900
Kingdom on Earth all of that. It's done.

804
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.000
but notice Joel this was

805
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.300
2,500 years ago. He's looking through

806
00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.800
that glass pretty dimly.

807
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.300
He's looking ahead to something he has no idea about but what

808
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.500
do we have the privilege of seeing we look back at this

809
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.800
Messiah Jesus who lived died

810
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.600
resurrected to guarantee that

811
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.300
that restoration is coming someday.

812
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.300
Because think about that when he came up out of the Grave alive with a

813
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.500
new body what it means is that those who are in him also will

814
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.400
one day be resurrected with a new body. No more

815
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.900
sickness no more death.

816
00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.600
He's guaranteed that restoration.

817
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.400
Even more than that when he ascended back to Heaven that means

818
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.600
one day he's coming back to inaugurate his kingdom fully

819
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.400
and finally on Earth where he is the king. There's no

820
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.400
more sin. There's no more warring Nations. It's just

821
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.400
him and his people fully perfect.

822
00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.200
Is guaranteed it?

823
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.300
So Joel is looking at this like man someday. I

824
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.300
hope this happens. I don't know what it looks like exactly. We still look

825
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.200
ahead. Yes, but we also look back to Jesus and what

826
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.600
he's done to guarantee all of this.

827
00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:39.600
That's how

828
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:41.800
that's how job.

829
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.000
That's how job could say.

830
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.000
which by the way

831
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.600
I know your life is hard.

832
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:52.900
Go read job.

833
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.400
He experienced the worst suffering beyond anything

834
00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.600
any of us will ever experience.

835
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.600
But that's that perspective that Eternal perspective is

836
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.300
how he could say in job 19:25 and

837
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.700
26. He says for I know that my redeemer

838
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.200
lives.

839
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.000
And at the last at the end, he will stand upon

840
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.500
the Earth.

841
00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.600
And after my skin has been thus destroyed

842
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.900
which for job he got destroyed.

843
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.600
Yet in my flesh.

844
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.300
Shall see God.

845
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.500
This is gonna be destroyed but I'm gonna get a new body and

846
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.500
in that body. I'll see God who standing on the earth.

847
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.300
That's how job could see it.

848
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.000
faith

849
00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.700
listen, I know the destruction of everything we know and love is hard when

850
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.800
you lose things. It's immensely difficult

851
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.700
and it should draw Us near to the Lord. Absolutely because

852
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.600
Hebrews 4:16 says let us with confidence draw

853
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.500
near to the throne of grace that we would

854
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.500
receive mercy and find Grace to help in our time of need. He

855
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.300
wants you to come to him for mercy and Grace

856
00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:10.900
in your need.

857
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.800
It should draw us to him, but it should also direct our

858
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.500
minds to the fact that this is not

859
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.100
the end.

860
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.800
Restorations coming the kingdom is coming

861
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.900
on Earth as it is in heaven. We have a king who Sovereign

862
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.400
who is good. And that's why we can

863
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.600
repent differently. That's why we can fast differently. That's

864
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.600
why we can pray differently.

865
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.500
Even if we don't understand what's going on, even if we can't see through

866
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.600
the mess.

867
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.200
Psalm 27:14 says wait for

868
00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:47.600
the Lord.

869
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.600
Wait for Yahweh. Be strong Let Your Heart Take courage.

870
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.200
Wait for the Lord.

871
00:44:58.900 --> 00:44:59.700
So what we're going to do now.

872
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.000
In light of all that we've seen in Joel how God's

873
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.300
stirring our hearts towards this dependence on

874
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.900
him. We're going to enter into a time set aside consecrated

875
00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.800
for the Lord in prayer.

876
00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.300
So over the next few minutes the worst leaders come back out and help be

877
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.300
a part of this. We're going to sing. We're going to pray we're gonna do some things

878
00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.400
as we are led by the spirit through

879
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.600
it. But let's just start in reflection

880
00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.300
of what God's done here in Joel 2 how

881
00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.100
he's applied that to our hearts.

882
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.100
And just ask you to Bow your heads to close your

883
00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:41.000
eyes. There's nothing super spiritual about that. It's just merely to remove distractions

884
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.600
from our lives.

885
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.700
And we can just focus on the Lord and even see

886
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.100
in our Mind's Eye what he wants us to

887
00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:48.400
see.

888
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.500
So just start by doing that and and quietly.

889
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.400
On your own just begin reflecting on what God has said

890
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.300
to you today.

891
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.700
How he wants you to respond to this.

892
00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.800
As James says to be a doer of the word not a

893
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.600
hearer only.

894
00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:17.600
What is he showing you?

895
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.700
about some things that

896
00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.800
even walking away from him in

897
00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.300
and holding on to your way instead of his way.

898
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.000
You've been looking at or participating in or

899
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.900
or eating or drinking those

900
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.200
things and

901
00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.100
he wants you to return to him.

902
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:46.800
What is it?

903
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.700
Maybe even pray Psalm 139 right

904
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.300
now 23 and 24.

905
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.800
Search me o God.

906
00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.700
know my heart

907
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.900
try me and know my thoughts what ask

908
00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.900
him to show you the motivations underneath

909
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:23.300
everything.

910
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.200
And see if there be any Grievous way in me.

911
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.300
Lead Me in the way Everlasting

912
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.200
ask him to show you sin.

913
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.200
temptations that you're holding on to

914
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.500
and ask him to lead you in the way.

915
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:49.200
his way

916
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.800
until 2 said to consecrate the congregation that's an idea

917
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.500
of setting apart purifying.

918
00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.200
How does he want to purify you right now?

919
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:26.300
Cleanse wash away junk that's cluttering

920
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.500
your pursuit of Jesus.

921
00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:31.900
Take it to him.

922
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.200
Goodness, take it to him.

923
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.100
Let him forgive let him wash.

924
00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.200
You confess your Cindy's faithful and just to forgive you and to cleanse you

925
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.100
from all unrighteousness.

926
00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.400
Maybe for the first time ever or in a long time. You're feeling the

927
00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:01.900
weight.

928
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.600
of the sin

929
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:07.300
in your life

930
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:09.800
and you just can't

931
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.600
can't even sit. You have to you're kind of being forced to

932
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.400
your knees before the Lord. That's fine.

933
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.700
Nothing wrong with right where you are getting out

934
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.100
sitting on the ground on your face

935
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.200
on your knees. Whatever. If you need to come to the front, it's kind

936
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.600
of a marker. There's nothing spiritual about this up here, but just a

937
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.000
marker in your own heart of a step of faith.

938
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:33.900
Don't be ashamed.

939
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.300
He wants you to feel the weight of it so that he can lift the

940
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.800
weight off in his grace.

941
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.100
Others of you might be feeling that disaster from the outside

942
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:02.900
Source right now.

943
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.800
It's nothing you did. It's

944
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.600
that diagnosis or

945
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.500
that abusive spouse or

946
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:15.400
that

947
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.300
job loss, or

948
00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:19.000
whatever

949
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.200
from an outside

950
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.400
pressure on you and you're feeling the weight of that and

951
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.700
it's restricting. It's hard to follow Jesus

952
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.200
and pursue him.

953
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.100
We want to help carry that burden for you.

954
00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:38.400
So we've done this.

955
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.500
something like this before where if you

956
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.100
would just be so bold if that's you if you're feeling the

957
00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.100
weight of something that

958
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.300
it just so burdensome to you. It's hindering worship

959
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.700
hindering your faith.

960
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.400
I don't really believe that God's good at times I struggle to see his

961
00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:57.600
goodness.

962
00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.000
If you'd be so bold to just stand up and admit

963
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.200
that and say I need prayer because we

964
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.700
want to surround you want people to to gather around you and pray for

965
00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:10.200
you in this moment. We're not going to separate all out and do the

966
00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.700
prayer groups like we've done before but but if you'd be willing if you're in

967
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.900
that moment and you're like I am in the disaster life is

968
00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:19.500
hard. I can't find my way. Would you

969
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.300
just stand up right now or raise your hand if you're unable to stand up.

970
00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.200
and if there's a few people right around there

971
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.400
you kind of take a look and quickly just look and

972
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:29.600
if

973
00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.700
There's a few that would gather around. Those people are standing. Thank

974
00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:34.500
you. Thank you.

975
00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.600
And just pray for them briefly Right Where You Are.

976
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.800
And just care for each other.

977
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.200
There's no shame.

978
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.200
There's no shame in admitting like Brokenness because we're

979
00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:47.600
all broken.

980
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.000
And there's moments that we feel it more than others. But if that's you right now

981
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.100
again, don't don't hesitate if you if you need prayer stand up

982
00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.400
right now or raise your hand.

983
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.400
if you're seeing that somewhere around there just

984
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.400
Gather around and pray for them even out

985
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.200
loud pray for them.

986
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.000
God I thank you for these who have

987
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.100
courageously admitted where they're at.

988
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.900
God meet them where they are.

989
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.400
You draw near to the Broken Heart of these have admitted and

990
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.700
and said even publicly that they are brokenhearted right

991
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.400
now for whatever reason and we pray you would draw near

992
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:38.700
to them.

993
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.300
They would feel your love and peace through brothers and

994
00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.400
sisters surrounding them right now.

995
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.400
Thank you God.

996
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.100
care for them care for all of us those who

997
00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.200
are even wanting to but didn't

998
00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:00.400
stand up.

999
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:03.600
encourage God

1000
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.800
encourage and meet needs

1001
00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:18.500
one thing that

1002
00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:20.000
we

1003
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.400
see happen in situations and times like these in our

1004
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:26.800
lives where

1005
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.800
God kind of asks the question of us.

1006
00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:36.900
Will we surrender to him?

1007
00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:38.800
We don't like that word.

1008
00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.500
but when he's the authority King

1009
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.800
savior who's good?

1010
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:47.500
It's worth it.

1011
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.500
We have no fear should have no fear to surrender these

1012
00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.300
situations. We're praying for anything else in our lives to him.

1013
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.500
Remember the songs that we sing are also prayers.

1014
00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.600
So we're going to sing a song very familiar. I surrender

1015
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:04.700
all.

1016
00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:06.700
as a prayer

1017
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.400
so wherever you've kind of walked through the last few minutes here

1018
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.000
God's shown you some things in your heart open your

1019
00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.700
hands to him and say Jesus I surrender all

1020
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:17.900
to you.

1021
00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.800
This is what we

1022
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.700
've been called to what we should want.

1023
00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:25.900
hard to do

1024
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.300
But let's make this a prayer to him now as we sing I surrender all

1025
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:30.400
together.

1026
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:40.200
Oh to Jesus.

1027
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:46.800
I surrender to him.

1028
00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.100
I freely.

1029
00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.600
and Trust

1030
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.400
in his presence

1031
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:07.400
I Surrender

1032
00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:18.100

1035
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.100
It's where I

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.400
served

1037
00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.000
to Jesus

1038
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:42.900
surrendered his feet

1039
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:48.400
worldly pleasures

1040
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:52.400

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.600
It's easy to say and to sing. Of course.

1057
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:30.600
It's hard to do.

1058
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.400
So we're going to be just quiet.

1059
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.200
Process through what the Lord has showed you the last

1060
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.300
few moments.

1061
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.400
Of what does he want you to surrender to him?

1062
00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.800
Ask him to search you.

1063
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:50.600
see where

1064
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.400
Where you need to release something?

1065
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.400
We're often never quiet to let that happen. So let's

1066
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.800
just be totally quiet.

1067
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.100
and asking the Lord to move

1068
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:02.800
in our own hearts

1069
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.700
father confirming us

1070
00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:44.400
not

1071
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.800
a try harder mentality

1072
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:53.000
a New Year's resolution idea today confirm in

1073
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:56.300
us your goodness your kindness.

1074
00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.200
Your Love

1075
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.400
so deeply that it compels us to action.

1076
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.000
we take steps because

1077
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:10.700
who you are is good.

1078
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.500
Who you are is enough.

1079
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:14.500
and Who We Are

1080
00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.500
in relation to who you are

1081
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:20.300
Should bring us sorrow.

1082
00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.800
But joy, because you cross that boundary.

1083
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:34.200
So may we respond today in this week with joy?

1084
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:35.900
excitement

1085
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.300
anticipation to repent

1086
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.000
fast to pray

1087
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.600
to be near you
