WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.100
Okay, we will go ahead and get started. Thank you guys

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.900
for showing up again for the final.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.700
Wednesday in this whole series

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.000
so we did have that one cancellation a couple

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.500
of weeks ago.

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.700
Which we unfortunately can't make up.

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
So this eight weeks study is now a seven week

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.800
study.

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.500
And so that means that we have to

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.400
Omit some material.

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.200
So what I'm going to Omit is most of week 7

12
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.200
Okay week seven remember as we went through the flow here. We

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.800
had the last two weeks of this. We're going to be about the translation

14
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.800
of the scripture.

15
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.000
And really the first of those two weeks.

16
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.400
Which was week seven is going

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.900
to be mostly on the other earlier languages and

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.500
then week eight is going to focus mostly on

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.600
English. So

20
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.100
I decided to Omit a lot of the

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.000
other languages and we're just going to focus on English. So.

22
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
You're welcome. No more Greek. No more

23
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.900
Hebrew. We're just going to talk about English today. Although

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.100
I would encourage you.

25
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.300
the other languages

26
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.300
are very very important and I

27
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.400
think very very interesting also.

28
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.900
We we did not talk about Latin. We did

29
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.600
not talk about Coptic. We did not talk about Syriac. All

30
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.400
three of those languages were very

31
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.100
very important in the early church.

32
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.800
Syriac meaning the entire eastern part

33
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.100
of the church, which we don't really ever hear much about

34
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.400
but starting in remember Jesus said starting

35
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.900
in Jerusalem, Judea Samaria and the ends of the Earth.

36
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.800
well

37
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.100
Most of our history classes only go

38
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.400
west but that's a radius right? That's a radiating

39
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.500
pattern. And so we have to go east as well. Syriac is

40
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.000
the language which traveled East Latin predominantly

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.900
was in the western part of the church.

42
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.300
Talked a little bit about it here and there.

43
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.100
but we're not going to focus on it now and Coptic is

44
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.200
Egyptian

45
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.900
which was very foundational to the early Church in Alexandria and

46
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.500
Egypt, but we're not going to have time to

47
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.700
focus on that one as well. So those

48
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.700
three languages are really other than Greek.

49
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.400
The most important languages that the

50
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.500
Bible has has been translated into at least in early

51
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.700
church. Okay. The Latin Vulgate

52
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.200
was very early and still is

53
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
in use today by the clergy in

54
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.600
the Catholic Church.

55
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.200
So we are just going to talk about

56
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.300
the English Bible. Okay, so why

57
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.300
don't I open this up in prayer and then we'll get into it.

58
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.700
Lord we are just delighted Lord for

59
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.300
what you're doing in your body.

60
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.400
Lord you have given us your word you have told us

61
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.200
how you've given your word.

62
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.500
We are able to figure out with your

63
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
help and the clues that you've given us Lord how that

64
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.600
word has been Faithfully transmitted down

65
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.700
through the ages for thousands of years.

66
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400
And Lord this study has been

67
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.400
complicated.

68
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.800
This study has taken us through.

69
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.300
Difficult places in

70
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.100
geography difficult Concepts difficult languages,

71
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.200
we don't read or speak

72
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.100
or understand today.

73
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.800
But Lord, we're going to end today.

74
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.400
And Lord, I just pray that your your blessing will

75
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.800
be upon us Lord as we get to the final final stop.

76
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.100
And that's the Bible that we have today that

77
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.300
we've picked up at Mardels or

78
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.500
ordered on Amazon or

79
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.500
is on our smartphone.

80
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.100
Lord that we can read in our native language

81
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.000
and have the confidence that it is the same book.

82
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.100
That you inspired thousands of years ago.

83
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.600
So thank you for taking us on this journey. Thank you

84
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.900
for revealing yourself. Thank you for just the

85
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.400
the academic knowledge. But Lord also

86
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400
the knowledge that will hopefully grow us closer to you and

87
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.300
increase our faith.

88
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.200
And increase our defense of the Gospel.

89
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.400
So Lord, I pray that you would do this one last time for

90
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.100
us tonight that you would edify this subset

91
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.400
of your body.

92
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.600
And Lord, I just pray Lord for each one of us

93
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.100
who are here today that we would just walk away just a little

94
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.800
bit closer to you than when we came in.

95
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.600
And we just lift up Troy give him strength as he

96
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.200
teaches in the other room and finishes out that subject as well.

97
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.100
We pray all this in Jesus name. Amen.

98
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.800
English you're familiar with it up on the screen is

99
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.500
a map of all the English speakers

100
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.600
and this is going to be the end of week seven,

101
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.800
but this is where I want to start.

102
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.400
Is English is a very important language? Okay. It

103
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.000
is more important today than when it first started out many of

104
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.200
us don't even know where it came from.

105
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.200
But we speak it. It's our native language for the most part.

106
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.000
And we're fluent in it. And this is how we understand best

107
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.900
words and readings.

108
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.100
So where did it start?

109
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.000
Okay.

110
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.200
I'm glad you asked.

111
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400
We're going to go back to the early church. Okay, the island

112
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.000
of Britain was occupied.

113
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.600
Before Rome got there, but Rome also occupied it

114
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.400
and tertullian a church father in

115
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.500
North Africa writes at the end of the second century.

116
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.200
All the limits of the Spains and the diverse nations of

117
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.400
the Gauls and the haunts of the Britain inaccessible to

118
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.300
the Romans but subjugated to Christ.

119
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.500
Think about that for just a second political boundaries.

120
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.300
We may not be able to enter.

121
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.000
a place

122
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.700
but God's word.

123
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.600
can

124
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.000
God and His word know no boundaries

125
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.200
Okay, and that's the heart of this this quote

126
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200
by tertullian.

127
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.700
Romans may not have been able to conquer all of Britain.

128
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.700
But Britain can be subjugated to Christ.

129
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.800
Okay, so that's way back then.

130
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.100
but

131
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.300
Modern English gets it starts not

132
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.600
from the Romans, but from the people who migrate into England

133
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.200
after or what we now know is England

134
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.100
after the Romans have evacuated the area.

135
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.300
So they come in these are the Angles and the Saxons and the

136
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.500
Utes. You may not be descended from.

137
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.300
a German heritage

138
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.500
but your language is

139
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.300
okay, so the angles in the Utes and the

140
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.000
Saxons these were

141
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.500
Germanic peoples who migrated from

142
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.300
the continent over to the island of Britain

143
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.200
and they did that in about the fifth century beginning in

144
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.000
the fifth century.

145
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.600
So old English is very

146
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.500
much Germanic.

147
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.200
Okay, and I will show you some old English here in

148
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.200
a couple slides and I would love to see if

149
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.700
you could read it.

150
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.000
But before we get to that.

151
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.800
Who's our first hero of English scripture?

152
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.100
It's going to be this young English poet named Cadman.

153
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.700
You might be familiar with the Christian band cadman's

154
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:33.800
call.

155
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.300
They get this namesake from this man caveman.

156
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.600
Well, he had some

157
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.500
dreams. Apparently. This is the tradition. He

158
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.500
had some dreams saying compose this compose this

159
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.400
and so he would take scripture which was only available

160
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.700
in Latin at that time in this area.

161
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.700
And then begin to translate it and sing it and so

162
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.000
the very first English scripture in

163
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.400
the English language was done by

164
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.200
Cadman.

165
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.400
And it was incorporated into his poems

166
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.500
and his songs.

167
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.100
Okay, and look at the dates, this is the middle of the

168
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.300
seventh century.

169
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.200
So we're all familiar with the King James and we know it

170
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.100
to be old in its style. But this is

171
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.400
a thousand years before the King

172
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:24.600
James.

173
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.500
Okay, this is the first English scripture.

174
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.300
All that we know about Cadman was written down by

175
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.400
this man bead.

176
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.400
All that we know about bead was written down by this man

177
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.700
bead also.

178
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.700
But B department is the father of English History

179
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.300
and one of the most skilled academics

180
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.100
and theologians in his

181
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:49.500
time.

182
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.600
You can see the dates up there too about the beginning of the 8th century.

183
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.100
And he actually understood a little bit of

184
00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.500
Greek.

185
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.200
Now if you hear a few weeks ago and you

186
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.400
you were following along Greek was not known to

187
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.400
people during this time in western part

188
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.500
of Europe and England.

189
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.000
Is about as far west as you can go and still be.

190
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.400
in Europe

191
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.100
So, how did he learn Greek? Well, he picked it up

192
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.400
from an Interlinear that he had. Remember. Nobody could teach him he had

193
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:21.600
no.

194
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.200
He had no no one to teach him. No one to Mentor him or

195
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.800
show him how Greek worked or teach him the language. He picked

196
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.300
it up just by looking at Greek versus Latin.

197
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.600
He was skilled in Latin and he picked up a little bit of Greek, but

198
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.700
The last 40 days of his life. He translates the

199
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.300
Gospel of John.

200
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.500
In to English. So now we have the Gospel

201
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.200
of John in the English language, but he didn't

202
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.200
translate it from Greek. He translated it from Latin.

203
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.400
Okay, but this is the beginnings of our English scripture

204
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.000
and

205
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.300
bead is one of the heroes of the early what we call what

206
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.400
we would call The Old English times. Okay between about

207
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.100
450 and about 1,000 ad is

208
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.200
what we considered true Old English.

209
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.800
Now here you go. I'm going to take a sip of water quick and I'll

210
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.600
let you chew on this.

211
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.200
version of The Lord's Prayer in Two Old English dialects and

212
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.800
you can see

213
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.100
if you can read it.

214
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.600
Okay long enough give up.

215
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.200
Yeah, if you've been exposed to some German you might

216
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.300
have picked up be able to pick up a few words, but we can't

217
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.400
read this right. This is Old English. This is very much still

218
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.500
the transition from German to English.

219
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.000
So old English we're going to summarize it with this slide.

220
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.500
All of the Old English translations were made from the Latin Vulgate.

221
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.500
Okay, we do not have any old English being taken from

222
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.500
the Greek and the reason being

223
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.300
nobody understood it.

224
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.700
Nobody could read or write or speak it.

225
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.300
So we're going to move on to Middle English. Okay, and this is going

226
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.300
to occupy the time from about 1,000 to

227
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.600
about 1500 ad.

228
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.100
And now you might be familiar with one of the heroes of

229
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.500
the Middle English time, John Wickliffe.

230
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.700
Okay, you've heard of John Wickliffe.

231
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.900
He was an English philosopher and a theologian.

232
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.100
Called The Morning Star of the reformation and he was very

233
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.600
outspoken against the leadership of the Catholic Church.

234
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.600
Okay, he considered them incompetent and

235
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.400
out for gain.

236
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.000
And He was largely correct in that.

237
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.700
But he is credited to be the first person to translate

238
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.200
the entire Bible will give him the New

239
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.200
Testament and he and his associates finished up with

240
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.500
the Old Testament. But at his time he is credited

241
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.500
with the complete Bible in English for the

242
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.100
very first time.

243
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.600
And the date on that was 1384.

244
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.200
Okay, this is now still 250 or so

245
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.700
years before the King James. And before what

246
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.500
else if you remember before the printing press.

247
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.400
So when we look at his work, his work

248
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.700
was a translation of the entire Bible written by

249
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.300
hand.

250
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.400
Okay, he could not just send it to the publisher and have

251
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.700
him print off a couple copies.

252
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.700
but 250 manuscripts

253
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.100
at least

254
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.400
were made 20 of them complete and still

255
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.800
remain to this day.

256
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.900
I don't know that we're going to have a lot of time for storytelling. I

257
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.400
do need to get to the meat of the English

258
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.000
translations here, but Wycliffe did not

259
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.400
die a martyr.

260
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.300
But he was very much hated by the Catholic Church.

261
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.400
Okay, and hated so much that 30 years after

262
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.600
his death.

263
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.700
There was a decision made to dig up his bones and

264
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.300
burn them.

265
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.600
And those bones were then the ash

266
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.700
from the his bones were dumped into the river and there

267
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.200
is a really really good quote, which I do want to

268
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:24.600
read.

269
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.200
Okay Thomas Fuller in the 17th century

270
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.100
said they burned his bones to ashes and cast him

271
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.800
into the Swift a neighboring Brook running hard by.

272
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.000
Thus the brook hath conveyed his ashes into the Avon Avon

273
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.300
into the Severn Severn into the narrow seas and

274
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.400
they into the main ocean.

275
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.200
And thus the ashes of Wickliffe are the

276
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.000
emblem of his Doctrine which is now dispersed the

277
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.600
world over.

278
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.000
How about that? God can use even an

279
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.500
event like digging up a dead man's

280
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:57.900
bones?

281
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.300
To exemplify his word going

282
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.500
out to the entire.

283
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:03.700
Earth

284
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.100
so very cool story tragic that it happened but

285
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.600
a very cool story and how God used it for his glory.

286
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.600
And that of course burned what we now know is Wycliffe

287
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.800
Bible translators. Okay, you can go to their page and

288
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.300
There are still people on Earth today who do not

289
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.400
have the Bible in their language. That is

290
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.900
something that Wycliffe lived for died for.

291
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.900
And he would be very honored that

292
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.300
his name is being carried over today with an

293
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.500
organization. That's trying to do the same thing in our

294
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:36.500
time.

295
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.700
So you can go there to their website and see which languages they

296
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.000
still need. But let's summarize Middle English Middle English.

297
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.600
All Middle English translations were

298
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.100
made from the Latin Vulgate including Wycliffe.

299
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.000
Not from the biblical languages because because 1500

300
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.300
ad.

301
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.200
Is still too early.

302
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.300
We do not yet have the humanists and their education of the

303
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.400
Greek and the Hebrew.

304
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.400
Into Western Europe, so everything in the English language

305
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.500
up to Modern English.

306
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.000
Is going to be from the Latin.

307
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:16.400
Okay.

308
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.700
One moment while I switch.

309
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.000
presentations here

310
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.500
So what happens after Wickliffe?

311
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.600
Well English becomes much much more important

312
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.000
on a global scale.

313
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.400
Okay, it becomes much more important England becomes

314
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.600
a military superpower and the English

315
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.800
language and the culture.

316
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.300
Is being spread and more important becoming more

317
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.000
important outside of Britain as well. And of course,

318
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.100
we all know that

319
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.400
it then transfers over to our continent as well.

320
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.300
Okay. So Modern English is where we are at and

321
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.800
with Modern English. There are grammatical reasons

322
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.500
why it's called Middle English or sorry Modern

323
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:06.800
English.

324
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.000
But there's also now a turning point with Biblical scholarship.

325
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.100
Okay. Now we actually have people with the faculties to

326
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.100
understand read write understand speak.

327
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.500
The biblical languages which we didn't have in the

328
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.600
early and Middle English.

329
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.200
Okay, so our first big hero of Modern English is

330
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.100
going to be William Tyndale. You've probably heard of William

331
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.600
Tyndale as well.

332
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.200
He is credited as being the first person.

333
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.500
to translate the Bible

334
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.400
the New Testament at least from the original languages

335
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.700
into English

336
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.500
Okay, and he started on the Old Testament

337
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.100
as well because he was fluent in Hebrew as well.

338
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.500
But God did not allow him

339
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.700
to live long enough.

340
00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.500
to finish that job

341
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.800
because he added out with the King.

342
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.400
King Henry at the time

343
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.300
about his marriage and the King didn't

344
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.300
like him and the church didn't like him and he was

345
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.100
handed over and he was strangled to death.

346
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.200
And burned at the stake.

347
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.500
his dying words

348
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.600
Lord open the king of England's eyes.

349
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.100
Imagine that a martyr for wanting people to know the

350
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.500
Bible.

351
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.600
in their native language

352
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:35.700
is killed

353
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.000
and here's his dying words. It's a prayer not

354
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.300
just for the king. But that this work that

355
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.700
God was using him for would continue on.

356
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.100
Okay, it didn't matter to him that

357
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.500
he wasn't going to be involved any longer. He wanted God's work

358
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.200
to continue. Do you see that in the in the heart of

359
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.100
the of the quote?

360
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.400
But what did he want? There's a really really famous

361
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.800
conversation here, which is worth reading here.

362
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.700
About a dialogue an argument between William Tyndale and

363
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.100
a clergyman inside the Catholic Church the clergyman

364
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.700
tells Tyndale we had better be without God's laws

365
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.000
than the popes.

366
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.200
Tyndale responded I defy the Pope

367
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.200
and all his laws and if God

368
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.300
spares my life air many years. I will cause the boy

369
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.800
that driveth the plow to know more of the scriptures than

370
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.200
you do.

371
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.400
That's one of my favorite quotes in all of church history.

372
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.500
Look at what he's look at what he's saying?

373
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.000
tyndale's heart

374
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.300
I want the I want the boy that drives the

375
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.800
plows to know God's word.

376
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.300
God's word is not just meant for you.

377
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.800
High UPS in the church

378
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.600
It's meant for everybody. He could

379
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.700
have chosen anybody but to choose the plowboy

380
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.400
is relevant and indicative of

381
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.100
his comment that he wants everybody to know God's word. Everybody

382
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.800
has a fundamental right to have access.

383
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:13.700
to the Bible

384
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.400
Tyndale died for that

385
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.400
Tyndale died for that it was his mission in life to

386
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.700
do it and it was his prayer and death.

387
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.700
That it would continue on.

388
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.500
So because the church did not like him and this work

389
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.000
was so outlawed that there's only four copies

390
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.300
remaining today.

391
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.400
They were all destroyed only four remain today of

392
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.200
tyndale's work Tyndale was able to take advantage of

393
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.000
the printing press.

394
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.500
Okay, so he did not have to copy by hand.

395
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.100
So there was many many copies made but most of them were

396
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:51.600
destroyed.

397
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.500
How important was tyndale's work? Well up

398
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.400
to 83% of the King James and our

399
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.900
modern New Testament is derived directly from

400
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800
William Tyndale

401
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.300
and his pioneering work in the New Testament.

402
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:10.800
well

403
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.500
If you're going to make some enemies why.

404
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.700
What was it about his work and his translation that had

405
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.100
the church so up in arms.

406
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.100
I've got a couple examples here and it's it's worth our time

407
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.900
to to investigate some of these.

408
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.200
Jesus when he asked Peter in a

409
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.400
very famous conversation

410
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.900
Who do you say that? I am?

411
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.400
Jesus says that to Peter

412
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.000
And Peter says I believe you're the Son of God, right? And Jesus says

413
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.300
yes, and on this

414
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.800
rock. I will build my church. Well.

415
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.300
Wycliffe in 1384 translated he translates

416
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:47.800
it Church.

417
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.100
Okay Tyndale comes and he translated congregation

418
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.200
on this rock. I will build my congregation.

419
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.500
Now the Greek word EK lesia is actually

420
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.800
better translated congregation.

421
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.600
Tyndale was on to something.

422
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.400
in 1610 the douay Reams,

423
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:06.900
let me get

424
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.100
A pointer up here so you can see along.

425
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.600
the douay Reams in 1610 is a Catholic version

426
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.900
of the Bible and it goes back to

427
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.700
use the word Church King James

428
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.800
himself in his version in 1611

429
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.400
gives the authority to say no. Look we're

430
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.800
going to go back and use the word church.

431
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.800
So it was really King James and his decision.

432
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.900
That we all say in our familiar with the word church today

433
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.100
in the Protestant church.

434
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.700
Okay. If not for that we would be calling this a

435
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.300
congregation. We do use

436
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.200
that term but church was largely.

437
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.700
a derivative of the Catholic tradition

438
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.900
Why did the church have a problem with the word congregation? Well,

439
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.200
it made everybody in here.

440
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.300
equal

441
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:02.400
to

442
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.200
the head of the church or the pastor or in that

443
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.000
case the priest and the Catholic Church did not

444
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.200
want anything to do with that.

445
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.300
They liked having it to where they could lure it over the people.

446
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.900
Okay, so that's why they wouldn't allow a Bible in their language.

447
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.700
And that's why they did not like the term congregation.

448
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.500
another thing in Acts 14:23

449
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.200
where Paul is appointing Elders Wycliffe translates

450
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.700
priests.

451
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.400
They appointed priests in all the churches and all

452
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.500
the cities Tyndale changes that word to elders.

453
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.700
The douay Reams changes it back to priests.

454
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.200
And then King James does go

455
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.100
forward with tyndale's interpretation here.

456
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.600
And the Greek word presbyteras is

457
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.700
better translated as elders.

458
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.000
That's why we have Elders in our church. Today is

459
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.100
because a Tyndale.

460
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.600
And his use of the word Elders for this Greek

461
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.500
word as opposed to priests.

462
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.200
And one more and this is probably the biggest one Acts 2:38.

463
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.700
Peter said to him do ye pennants?

464
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.800
So, how do we be? How do we get saved? Do ye pennants?

465
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.800
That's what Wycliffe says in Acts 2:38

466
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.900
as Peter is preaching at Pentecost.

467
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.600
Tyndale

468
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.700
says repent

469
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.200
the Catholic do a reams of 1610 reverts back

470
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.200
to Due pennants.

471
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.600
And King James thankfully continues on with tyndale's repent.

472
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.700
The Greek word is metanoia for

473
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.300
repentance. It's a compound word. It means

474
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.500
meta after and no us

475
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.700
a thought. It's an afterthought repentance as

476
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.200
Tyndale rightly new is all in the

477
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.100
mind. It is a thought it is not an action repentance

478
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.500
is not an action. It's not something you

479
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.000
do. It's something you think.

480
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.900
And Tyndale rightly knew that about the word and

481
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.900
he took the verbal aspect out of the the

482
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.100
action-oriented verb out of

483
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.100
the translation and thankfully.

484
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.300
The Protestant Bibles from there on have done the

485
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:21.400
same.

486
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.700
Okay, you can see how important tyndale's work

487
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.000
was and why the church at that time was

488
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.900
so much against it.

489
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.700
So here's a brief list of all the things that that Tyndale

490
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.900
has coined whether words or phrases that we

491
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.200
just take for granted let there be light.

492
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.800
It came to pass eat drink and be merry.

493
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.600
No, man can serve two masters.

494
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.900
Passover scapegoat, these are all words that were and phrases

495
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.300
that were coined by Tyndale.

496
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.700
in his pioneering English Bible

497
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.000
that we are now read in ours.

498
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.500
And take for granted many times.

499
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.200
Okay, so Tyndale had given his life for

500
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.500
this.

501
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.900
Now we're going to find a pretty much a linear road

502
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.200
all the way to the King James and I'm

503
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.000
going to go rather quickly because we've got a lot of Bibles to cover here.

504
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.600
so Coverdale miles Coverdale

505
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.200
Is the successor he had taken basically tyndale's work

506
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.600
and added to it in the Old Testament where Tyndale

507
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.300
didn't translate and so Coverdale and his

508
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.600
Bible of 1535 is now the first complete printed

509
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.600
English Bible. Okay, because Tyndale didn't finish

510
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.000
the Old Testament.

511
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.500
So Coverdale did finish it, but covered El

512
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.600
didn't take it from the Hebrew. He took it from the

513
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.200
German and the Latin.

514
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.500
And he added it to tyndale's work. So we

515
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.200
don't yet have a complete Bible from the original languages. But

516
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.200
this is the next step in the process.

517
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.300
and look below

518
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.200
dedicated to the king and queen with no serious opposition.

519
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.100
A year later Tyndale will give his life.

520
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.800
This is a year before that happens.

521
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.700
And God is already beginning to answer his dying

522
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.200
prayer.

523
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.800
We can see God at work.

524
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.300
And God is often at work. Well, we pray and even

525
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.300
before we pray.

526
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.600
Right, and this is proof.

527
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.900
in history that that's true

528
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.500
Matthew's Bible 15:37 published by

529
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.300
John Rogers under the pen name of Thomas

530
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.300
Matthew. He used a pen name because later on

531
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.900
when England was ruled by the Catholic

532
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.700
Queen Mary Mary Tudor.

533
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.500
He was running for his life got caught and he was later

534
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.200
burned at the stake. So another man giving his

535
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.500
life.

536
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.400
For Bible translation in our language.

537
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:55.900
So we

538
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.000
Can have it and have access to it?

539
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.200
the great Bible

540
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.200
Henry the eighth the same man who had William Tyndale

541
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.200
murdered martyred

542
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.100
Has now authorized for the church an English

543
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.000
Bible to be translated and that's what

544
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.500
this is. This is the first one to be authorated authorized by

545
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.000
the king.

546
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.900
the great Bible called the great Bible because it was

547
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.600
very large

548
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.000
Not because it was great but because it was large.

549
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.100
as we move on

550
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.100
now when Mary does take the throne the Protestants have

551
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.700
to run for their lives. So the Protestants

552
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.400
are going to hop over the channel into

553
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.100
the continent and they're going to flee down

554
00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.800
to Geneva and they're going to come up with their translation

555
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.100
of the Bible in English in Geneva. We call

556
00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.100
it the Geneva Bible.

557
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.700
Well, who did they meet in Geneva? Well at that time it was the

558
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.200
head was John Calvin. You've probably heard of John

559
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.400
Calvin. John Calvin was French.

560
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.400
But he was more than happy to help them

561
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.200
with their translation. I don't know how much he knew

562
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.700
English, but he was more than happy to supply them notes that were anti-catholic.

563
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:17.700
Doctrine

564
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.200
so this Bible was most famous for its notes and

565
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.800
you can see that there is text.

566
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.900
And then there is a whole bunch of notes around that

567
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.700
text. It had copious copious notes.

568
00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.800
The other thing this Bible was famous for

569
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.400
It now has verses.

570
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.200
All the Bibles before the Geneva Bible did not

571
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.300
have verses right if you remember.

572
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.600
verses were created verse numbers were

573
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.000
created

574
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.300
in 1551 by stefanus in

575
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.500
his Greek addition. We talked about that about four weeks

576
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:53.600
ago.

577
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.600
The timing is now that diverse has exist and

578
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.400
they show up for the first time in the Geneva Bible

579
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.200
in English.

580
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:02.500
Okay.

581
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.300
very very popular bible

582
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.000
Shakespeare Cromwell

583
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.200
The Mayflower pilgrims the Jamestown colonists the

584
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.300
very first Bible in English in this continent was the

585
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.100
Geneva Bible.

586
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.000
So what was Calvin's influence? Well, let me

587
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.200
read you a couple of his notes.

588
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.600
And you'll find out.

589
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.700
the notes on Revelation

590
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.200
That is the Pope.

591
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.300
with hatch with hatch

592
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.500
Which hath his power out of hell?

593
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.800
and cometh stents

594
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.500
on Revelation 17:4

595
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.400
the woman is the Antichrist. That is the Pope.

596
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.700
with the whole body of his filthy creatures

597
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.400
These are in the study Guides of the Geneva Bible the

598
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:55.900
study notes.

599
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.700
Okay, you see what the church is doing? It's a very much a battle

600
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.200
between the Protestant church and the Catholic church.

601
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.300
We can't appreciate it as much these days.

602
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.300
But that's what was going on.

603
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.400
They can't alter the text, but they can sure put their opinions in

604
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.200
the sidebars and that's exactly what Calvin did

605
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:17.900
with this Bible.

606
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.500
The Bishop's Bible is next 1568.

607
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.100
The Geneva Bible was deemed two calvinistic for

608
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:30.200
the established church of England. So the second authorized Bible

609
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.500
remember, the first one was the great Bible of 1539 here.

610
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.700
We are 30 years later and this

611
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.900
is The Bishop's Bible is now ordained and

612
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.900
commissioned as a authorized Bible

613
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.500
for the church.

614
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.600
This Bible is going to be the base for

615
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.200
the King James.

616
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.700
Which will be coming at about 50 years after this.

617
00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.500
Not to be outdone.

618
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.200
The Catholics when a Protestant takes the throne.

619
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.800
Now have to run for their lives.

620
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.400
And they flee across the channel and

621
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.400
go into the continent and they established themselves that

622
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.400
do a in France.

623
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.400
And they establish a seminary and they

624
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.000
begin work on their translation.

625
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:21.700
of the Bible

626
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.200
Well, you can expect since the Geneva Bible

627
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.300
was so anti-catholicism that this Bible is

628
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.300
also going to contain notes, which would be anti protestantism.

629
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.700
That's exactly what we get in

630
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.500
Matthew 6:24 the notes say you cannot serve

631
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.400
two masters God and bail Christ and

632
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.000
Calvin.

633
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.000
Not sure how helpful this is for getting to know the Lord.

634
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.100
In a deeper and more personal way.

635
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.300
But this is what we find in the margins. This

636
00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.900
is what was going on at the time.

637
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.600
One thing also I didn't mention about the Geneva Bible.

638
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.200
It is the first one to be translated in

639
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.300
its entirety from the original languages.

640
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.800
So all of the Old Testament is now from Hebrew all of

641
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.000
the New Testament is now from Greek.

642
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.600
After the do-way Reams in 1610 we go to 1611 and

643
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.600
here is our King James.

644
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.800
We've talked a lot about the King James.

645
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.100
There is a lot of emotion attached even present

646
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.800
day to the King James.

647
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.200
Okay, I grew up learning verses and

648
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.200
memorizing verses from the King James. Maybe a

649
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.400
lot of you did too. Maybe a lot of you still do.

650
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.400
One of the things we need to be careful about.

651
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.500
is idolizing

652
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.100
a version

653
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:54.900
of God's word

654
00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.800
and that's one of the things that I want to take very very

655
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.400
cautiously tread very cautiously on

656
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.800
is that there are people today who really get emotionally attached

657
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.300
to this and really get animated and antagonistic against

658
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.100
other versions.

659
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.100
even saw YouTube video not long ago

660
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.200
where they're calling people who are King James proponents are calling all

661
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.300
the modern versions that came after that basically satanic.

662
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.000
of the devil

663
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.300
Okay. So what I don't want to do in

664
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.000
this class is put a

665
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.400
version of the book on a pedestal

666
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.200
what I tried to do and as we've walked along through the

667
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.500
history of this process of getting God's word from God

668
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:48.400
to us is understand the historical context.

669
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800
of the King James

670
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.200
so that when we encounter the King James, which we are right

671
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.500
now, we will be better informed and better equipped to

672
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.600
understand what the King James actually is.

673
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.900
King James is a beautiful translation.

674
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.100
It is a wonderful translation. It is a very accurate and a very

675
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.500
faithful translation.

676
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.300
but remember what we talked about it is

677
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.200
a very good translation of

678
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.200
about 15 or 16

679
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.300
manuscripts

680
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.100
That were confined to the Greece and Turkey area of

681
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.600
the Byzantine Empire.

682
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.300
In the 10th of the 15th centuries.

683
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.300
Okay, so it is a very accurate translation of a

684
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:37.700
fairly

685
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.500
modern from this time

686
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.600
Byzantine text

687
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.300
of the church

688
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.200
over a thousand years removed from when the writings were

689
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.900
original of the New Testament.

690
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.900
Okay, so we have to understand the historical context

691
00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.900
of the King James.

692
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.800
Before we can allow those emotions.

693
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.900
to really grip us and

694
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.000
get the conversation and the debate heated.

695
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.800
Okay, this is until fairly recently

696
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.500
the most popular translation of

697
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.400
the Bible in any language. It has since been overtaken.

698
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.300
The King James is very very Monumental and

699
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.300
very much an important work in the history

700
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:24.700
of the Bible.

701
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.200
1611 was the King James. It was

702
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.600
commissioned by King James himself.

703
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.800
Because the people loved the Geneva Bible.

704
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.100
the church loved Bishop's Bible

705
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.800
and he didn't want to versions.

706
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.600
So he said okay Scholars, give us

707
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:47.900
one.

708
00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.700
To be read by the church.

709
00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.700
And they did and they did a good job.

710
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.200
And it still remains today to be very loved and very popular.

711
00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.000
So here we have it's very linear in the early modern English

712
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.300
time frame between Tyndale and the

713
00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.500
King James. It's very linear. We talked about one Bible after another

714
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.300
coming out each getting a

715
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.600
little bit more refined.

716
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:12.700
as we go

717
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.100
but all of these Bibles you'll remember are taken

718
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.500
from what Greek text

719
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.500
the textus receptus.

720
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.800
These were the more modern the younger Greek.

721
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.700
Manuscripts from the 10th to the 15th century. They

722
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.900
did not yet at this time. Either have or appreciate

723
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.800
all of the many manuscripts.

724
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.200
We would find from earlier in the church.

725
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.400
Okay that happens after the King James.

726
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.300
How are we doing on time? Okay.

727
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.300
We're going to plow through.

728
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.500
Modern English Bibles and we're not certainly going

729
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.000
to talk about all of them because we would be here to late Thursday

730
00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.000
if we did.

731
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.600
But our first stop in the Modern English Bibles is

732
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.100
going to be this revised version.

733
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.600
This was the only authorized and recognized revision

734
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.000
of the King James version.

735
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.100
Okay, this was an authorized revision of the King James.

736
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.700
Maybe you didn't know that but they are

737
00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.600
not going to be using the Texas receptus because

738
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.200
what happened just before 1885 was

739
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.500
West cotton Hort had published their

740
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.600
Greek New Testament.

741
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.600
Which had abandoned the Texas receptus?

742
00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.100
in favor of all of the

743
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.300
older manuscripts

744
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.400
that they had found in that intermediate time between King

745
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.400
James and now would now

746
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.300
is 1885.

747
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.100
And this was done in Britain.

748
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.600
And it included American Scholars who

749
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.100
they largely ignored.

750
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.000
but

751
00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.200
they had published.

752
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.300
This English version which had abandoned the Texas

753
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.500
receptus and by doing so they had come

754
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.600
up with their version which had about 30,000 changes.

755
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.800
from the King James

756
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.200
So very different when you use a different

757
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.500
manuscript base, you're going to get lots of differences. Okay, and

758
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.200
by textual criticism last week.

759
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.100
We have explained a lot of those variances.

760
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.500
Okay, that's the power of textual criticism

761
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.200
in the beauty of why we talk about that before we do this.

762
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.300
Just makes everything sit in context a little bit more clear.

763
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.300
So now the Americans because the British Scholars

764
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.300
largely ignored their suggestions said

765
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.500
well, we want to publish our own.

766
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:45.900
and

767
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.400
the British scholar said okay, but you have to wait 14 years. We

768
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.400
have an exclusivity period of 14 years.

769
00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:53.800
As I said, okay.

770
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.900
So they work on their American version of this

771
00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.400
and it becomes a 1901 published as

772
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.500
the American Standard Version.

773
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.200
It's very it's more Americanized versus it's American

774
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.000
English versus English.

775
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.900
Okay, instead of the Holy Ghost. We see the Holy Spirit. Okay,

776
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:16.600
things like that.

777
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.500
this Bible

778
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.400
has become

779
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.600
the basis for most of our Modern English translations

780
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.800
Okay, it was used as a base for the revised Standard

781
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.600
Version the new revised Standard

782
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.400
Version the English Standard Version The New American

783
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.300
Standard Bible.

784
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.300
And then the living Bible and some others.

785
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.000
We can get lost in the acronyms. It's easy to

786
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:46.100
do. I'm going to try and keep us on task, but it's easy to

787
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.100
get a lot of these confused. I know.

788
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.100
But 30,000 differences.

789
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.300
a lot of people who were

790
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.200
part of the tradition the old school who loved the King James

791
00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.300
and these new modern versions were coming out and

792
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.100
changing God's word.

793
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.400
They were getting this same thing that this YouTube video did

794
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.800
of this can't be from God.

795
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.200
What are you doing? You're corrupting God's word. You're taking out

796
00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.700
all of this stuff, right?

797
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.700
and here is one of these places where the American Standard

798
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.600
Version and then by derivative all of the Modern English

799
00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.500
versions since

800
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.400
Have been criticized. Okay, John 6:47.

801
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.400
The King James says verily verily I say unto you he that

802
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.700
believeth on me hath everlasting life.

803
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:38.000
The new American or the American Standard Version of 1901 says I

804
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.900
say unto you he that believeth.

805
00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800
hath eternal life

806
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.600
And the ESV says something very similar so they

807
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.300
were criticized you're taking.

808
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.200
the object of Faith out of the verse

809
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.500
Jesus says believe on me.

810
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.100
You're taking the on me out. That's the most important part.

811
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.100
the problem is

812
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:05.800
That's not very.

813
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.400
accurate

814
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.500
of a criticism

815
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.300
and we can prove it all of these objections to the Modern English.

816
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.100
Bible are very very testable.

817
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.300
And so we can test it here.

818
00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.400
Did the American Standard Version and everything subsequent have

819
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.500
a theological problem with Jesus being the object

820
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.300
of our faith?

821
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:27.200
No.

822
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.100
Because just seven verses before in John 6:40.

823
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.100
It reads in the American Standard Version for this is

824
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.600
the will of my father that everyone that beholdeth the son and believeth

825
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.200
on him.

826
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.700
Should have eternal life.

827
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.500
So you see there's no problem with Jesus. There's no problem with Believing on

828
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.600
him as the object of our faith.

829
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.500
The people with the criticisms did not do the due diligence.

830
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.400
To actually see if that was the case. We let emotions.

831
00:41:59.200 --> 00:41:59.900
Grip us.

832
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.700
in a lot of these arguments and confrontations

833
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.300
very testable

834
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.200
so why is it missing in that verse well because of textual criticism.

835
00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.400
We know that the oldest manuscripts did not contain the

836
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.400
words. So those words were not put in

837
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.400
the Modern English versions.

838
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.500
It doesn't mean they have a theological problem with those words because those words

839
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.600
are on all these other verses.

840
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.500
It's just for this verse.

841
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.200
It was not original.

842
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.900
In that text and so they were omitted.

843
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.700
Another one Colossians 1:14 in whom

844
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.700
we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of

845
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:39.500
sins.

846
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.400
The ASV ESV say in whom we have our Redemption the

847
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.300
Forgiveness of sins. They left out through his blood.

848
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.500
You guys have a problem with?

849
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:51.700
the blood

850
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.200
atonement of Jesus. Why did you take it out?

851
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.200
Well, did they take it out?

852
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.700
Colossians is very much a parallel

853
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.300
with Ephesians and we can go to Ephesians in

854
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.300
the in the American Standard Version in Ephesians

855
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.600
1:7 which reads in whom we have our Redemption

856
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.300
through his blood the Forgiveness of

857
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.000
our trespasses according to the riches of his grace.

858
00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:21.300
They don't have a theological problem with Jesus. They don't

859
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.600
have a theological problem with the blood.

860
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.300
of Jesus as our atonement

861
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.600
It just was not present in the original versions

862
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.300
of Colossians, but was later added.

863
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.800
Because of the parallel passage in Ephesians, okay, we

864
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.500
can deduce this we can test this now.

865
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:43.900
looking back

866
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.700
Okay, here we go. We're going to do a run through.

867
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.000
And as I go through some of these modern versions,

868
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.800
you're probably going to be thinking

869
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.100
as I'm talking boy. This guy doesn't like

870
00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:58.600
any of them.

871
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.900
Please I do. I like a lot of them.

872
00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.000
But as tour guide along this whole process

873
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.400
along this whole journey, I do want

874
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.600
to bring out some things and be more transparent maybe then.

875
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.900
the translators have been

876
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.300
and I just want to inform.

877
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.300
I'm not condemning. I'm not telling you which ones

878
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.600
to to go do and which ones to stay away from except

879
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.300
for one case.

880
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.700
But I'm just pointing out a lot of the things which might be easily overlooked.

881
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.600
Okay, the revised standard version of 1952. We've

882
00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.300
had a 50-year gap now.

883
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.600
1952

884
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.900
this version was supposed to be out there for the

885
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.100
scholarship the academics.

886
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.000
Something that was Modern what happened before 1952 well

887
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.500
in 1947 the Dead

888
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.300
Sea Scrolls.

889
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.600
were discovered

890
00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.300
So now we have more data.

891
00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.300
So the RSV relies pretty heavily on

892
00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.300
the Dead Sea Scrolls for the Old Testament.

893
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:09.600
Okay, so but it proved to be very unpopular.

894
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.500
And today only has you know less than 5% of

895
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.600
the market share by 1990.

896
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.200
But this was the basis now.

897
00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:21.000
for

898
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:22.900
the ESV

899
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.600
Okay, we're going to show how we got there.

900
00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.600
But before we do one of the things that the RSV was

901
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.600
criticized for was it has taken a lot

902
00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.600
of the Old Testament prophecies.

903
00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.600
And divorced them from the New Testament

904
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.500
fulfillments of those prophecies.

905
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.200
Okay, and one good example of that is here in the

906
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.500
American Standard Version of Isaiah 7:14. Therefore the

907
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.500
Lord himself will give you a sign Behold a virgin shall

908
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.100
conceive and bear a son shall call his name

909
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:55.700
Emmanuel.

910
00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.400
The RSV changes that virgin to

911
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.400
a young woman.

912
00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.100
oh, that's

913
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:04.900
a big difference

914
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.300
but maintains in Matthew the Fulfillment of

915
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.700
that Behold a virgin shall conceive and

916
00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:16.100
bear son. So why did they change it to a young woman?

917
00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.200
It's because they're treating the old and the new

918
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.400
independently.

919
00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.400
And they're translating the Hebrew word Alma.

920
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.300
as young woman

921
00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:31.400
when very clearly in the New Testament Matthew is using

922
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.000
the Greek word parthenos.

923
00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.600
as virgin

924
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.500
so we understand that Isaiah is forecasting and

925
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.400
foretelling prophesying the Virgin birth.

926
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.600
But because the RSV is treating him independently we get this young

927
00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:46.900
woman.

928
00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.700
Okay, a lot of people were were turned off.

929
00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.400
By that a lot of conservatives were

930
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.200
turned off by that.

931
00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.900
now the one which I will tell you to stay away from

932
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.600
1961 the New World Translation

933
00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.100
Put out by the Watchtower Society. Those are the

934
00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:07.900
Jehovah's Witnesses.

935
00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.000
Okay.

936
00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:14.000
It is a an entirely heretical translation that

937
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.700
diminishes the person of Jesus Christ and I

938
00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.500
will show you exactly what I mean.

939
00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:20.200
John 1:1

940
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.400
in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was

941
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.900
God King James.

942
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.300
We see it in the ESV even in

943
00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.400
the Catholic the modern Catholic Bible in 1950s.

944
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.700
But what they do in the New World Translation is

945
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.200
they change it to in the beginning was the word and the

946
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.600
Word was with God and the Word was a god.

947
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:43.900
Oh.

948
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.700
That changes our interpretation entirely, doesn't

949
00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:49.900
it?

950
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.700
Now they have their reason for it.

951
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.800
but their reason is incorrect and all of the

952
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.300
people who know Greek grammar would tell you it's incorrect.

953
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:06.800
to translate it with an indefinite a versus

954
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.100
a definite the

955
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.500
but what did the New World Translation do?

956
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.300
They didn't tell us who their translators were. They left

957
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.400
that page blank. You can go to the front of your Bible and

958
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.400
you can find out exactly who translated your Bible.

959
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.500
Okay, all their names and all their credentials are listed there.

960
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.200
But at the beginning of this they leave it blank. Why did

961
00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:30.800
they leave it blank?

962
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.000
Quote they did not want to advertise themselves. But

963
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.900
let all the glory go to the author of the scriptures God.

964
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.400
Well, that's fine.

965
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.100
Except we want to know if they know what they're talking

966
00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.400
about. That's why they put their names in the

967
00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.100
front of the Bible.

968
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.800
And it was later found out that only one person on the Translating committee

969
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.100
had any knowledge of the original languages of the

970
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:57.400
Bible.

971
00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:58.700
at all

972
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.600
So they were not able to make this translation. This translation

973
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.000
was entirely made to suit their Theology and

974
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.300
we can show you another example Colossians 1 we

975
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.000
get a beautiful doxology from Paul.

976
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.900
Telling us who Jesus really is. He

977
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.700
is the Creator God.

978
00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.100
all things were created

979
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.500
by him

980
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.200
But they changed this to say because by

981
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.500
means of him all other things.

982
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.600
Were created in the heavens all other things

983
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.400
have been created through him and he is

984
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.000
also before all other things that word

985
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.300
other.

986
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.000
Is not in the Greek.

987
00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.200
It's not in any manuscript. It's not in any Greek text.

988
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.500
It's hidden.

989
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.500
hidden from the reader

990
00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.700
To support a theology which we know is

991
00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.200
incorrect.

992
00:49:59.500 --> 00:49:59.700
Okay.

993
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.200
moving on

994
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.400
1966 the Jerusalem bible

995
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.400
What happened before 1966? This is a Catholic

996
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.600
version in 1943. The pope makes a

997
00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.400
declaration that now you can.

998
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.600
Study the original languages.

999
00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.500
Now you can translate from the original languages.

1000
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.000
into English

1001
00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.100
Or any other language before that, where did you have to get your

1002
00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:30.200
your scripture from?

1003
00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.400
The Latin you had to get it from the Latin

1004
00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.700
which is not original. It is a translation.

1005
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:40.100
But now in 1943 the pope makes that declaration. And

1006
00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.400
for the first time we have an English Bible called the

1007
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.700
Jerusalem bible that was taken from the original languages.

1008
00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.200
Jr. Are Tolkien had been a part of this.

1009
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.800
He translated the Book of Jonah.

1010
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.800
And this was later updated in 1985

1011
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.900
to the New Jerusalem bible.

1012
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.200
And I have not read it. But from

1013
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.400
what I hear and have looked at it seems like a very competent.

1014
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:10.500
Translation of the scripture, but this is widely used

1015
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.300
in the English-speaking Catholic Church.

1016
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.300
So the American Standard Bible gives way to The New

1017
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.000
American Standard Bible in 1971.

1018
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.800
This was published to be a conservative alternative

1019
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.600
to the revised Standard Version the RSV, which

1020
00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.000
we talked about a few slides ago.

1021
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.500
It's considered to be one of the more or

1022
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.400
the most literal translation of

1023
00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.600
the original languages.

1024
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.900
Okay, and when I say literal?

1025
00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.700
We need to understand that literal.

1026
00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.700
Does not equal best.

1027
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.800
literal means literal

1028
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.800
that means every word comes across and sometimes

1029
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.300
it's very hard to read because we just don't

1030
00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.700
read that way. Okay, so literal does

1031
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.800
not mean best. It just means literal word

1032
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.200
for word.

1033
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.800
Although it is a very good translation.

1034
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.500
The living Bible of 1971 many of

1035
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.300
you probably know this.

1036
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.500
Kenneth Taylor

1037
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:20.400
was doing his devotions out of the King James with his

1038
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.000
kids and said well, maybe there's a way to paraphrase this to make

1039
00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.300
it more understandable for my kids.

1040
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.300
And so the living Bible was created.

1041
00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.200
out of that concept

1042
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.500
It is a paraphrase which is the opposite now of.

1043
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.600
Literal, okay literal word for

1044
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:39.900
word.

1045
00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.700
Paraphrase is now.

1046
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.600
thought for thought

1047
00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.900
a paraphrase will take the original languages and translate

1048
00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.900
out a sentence and then rearrange the

1049
00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.500
wording of that sentence and add some

1050
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.500
things to make it more readable and understandable.

1051
00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.000
So you have a very different feel.

1052
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.100
From The New American Standard to say the living Bible. Okay,

1053
00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:08.800
they're going to read very differently, but they're

1054
00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.200
both taken from the original languages. Okay.

1055
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.700
the NIV

1056
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.400
started in well before 1978 but

1057
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.300
first version published in 1978.

1058
00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:26.800
We will.

1059
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.000
Talk about this, okay.

1060
00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.400
It is now the most popular bible.

1061
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:36.200
in history

1062
00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:38.600
in any language

1063
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.400
Okay by terms of volume and sales.

1064
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.300
What they're doing though in recent updates to

1065
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:47.800
the NIV?

1066
00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.600
Is they've adopted this thing called gender neutrality

1067
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.400
and we talked a little bit about it last week as kind of a primer.

1068
00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.300
But gender neutrality was brought out by

1069
00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.500
the new revised Standard Version, but here

1070
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.300
in the NIV in 1992.

1071
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.300
They adopted a new philosophy on

1072
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:13.100
how to translate the Bible in terms of its masculinity. Okay.

1073
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.700
The Bible is very masculine book. It is

1074
00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:18.400
a lot of the pronouns are masculine a

1075
00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:18.700
lot of the

1076
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.000
A lot of the objects and a lot

1077
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:25.600
of the conversation is all dictated to

1078
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.500
us in masculine terms.

1079
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.300
That doesn't necessarily leave.

1080
00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:34.400
Women out it's just how God

1081
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.100
transmitted it in the culture that he was in

1082
00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:41.000
or the culture that the authors were in but as

1083
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.700
we can see in the niv's adopted philosophy.

1084
00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.300
They wanted to change that.

1085
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.300
It's two masculine. They wanted to change it. They say

1086
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.800
in part of their their guide authors of

1087
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.600
the biblical books.

1088
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.600
Sometimes can offend modern sensibilities.

1089
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.300
The patriarchalism. Okay, that's all the masculinity of

1090
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:03.600
the Bible.

1091
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:09.100
Can tend to deny the common human dignity of

1092
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.800
all hearers and readers.

1093
00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:12.900
Okay, how does that sound?

1094
00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:17.700
This is the philosophy that the NIV has adopted.

1095
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.400
had adopted in 1992

1096
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.700
Let's look at an example here.

1097
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.400
In the NIV of 1984. So before

1098
00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.400
that Psalm 1 1 to 3, okay.

1099
00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.100
Blessed is the man who does not walk into counsel the

1100
00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:37.600
wicked or stand the way of Sinners sitting a seat of mockers. But his

1101
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.400
Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law he

1102
00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.200
meditates on it day and night you see how masculine this

1103
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.300
is. We have the hymns the he's

1104
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.800
after they adopted

1105
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.500
the gender-neutral philosophy in 1992

1106
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.500
They wanted to publish an update in 1996. They published

1107
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:57.900
it in.

1108
00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.500
the UK

1109
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:03.300
in which they wanted to adopt this philosophy and

1110
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:04.800
change all of these pronouns to

1111
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.400
Neutral pronouns take the heat out

1112
00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.700
of it take the hymn out of it.

1113
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.200
Okay, so in 1996, they wanted to do that,

1114
00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.500
but the conservative readership of the NIV here

1115
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.200
in the states would have nothing to do with that.

1116
00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.500
Okay, they said no, we don't want that.

1117
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.200
We don't want that so they said okay, we won't

1118
00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.500
do it here in the states. We're going to publish it in the UK.

1119
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:31.300
And so they did in 1996. They published

1120
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.000
it in the UK.

1121
00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:37.100
a little bit later in 2005

1122
00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.100
They made an update to make it more readable.

1123
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.400
Okay, they wanted to make this thing they

1124
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.500
called ultimately the tniv the today's

1125
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.200
New International Version in 2005.

1126
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:54.600
So this was an international version not

1127
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.500
a US version and look how this reads here

1128
00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.700
in the same Psalm blessed. Are those who do

1129
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:01.200
not walk?

1130
00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.600
But who Delight in the law of the Lord and meditate on

1131
00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.300
his law day and night. They are like a

1132
00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.500
stream or tree planted by streams of water. You see

1133
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.400
what they did. They took the Heat and the hymn out.

1134
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.300
But this got blasted.

1135
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:19.200
Why did it get blasted not just because of the gender neutrality, but

1136
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.800
what also did they do? They didn't affect just gender they affected.

1137
00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:24.100
number

1138
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:30.400
the beauty of this Psalm doesn't lie

1139
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.500
in the he and the hymn it lies in.

1140
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.400
the soul the soul believer

1141
00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.000
Who is in the midst of the world?

1142
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.500
Who's being tempted by a group of people?

1143
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.700
It's a singular believer not being

1144
00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:49.500
tempted to go along with a plurality of

1145
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:49.900
the world.

1146
00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.400
That's what this Psalm is about.

1147
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.300
And they have completely.

1148
00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.300
obliterated that

1149
00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.500
they didn't just make it gender neutral. They made it number.

1150
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.000
plural

1151
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.200
and so they did get criticized for this the tniv was

1152
00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.000
not a good seller so they wanted to update this and

1153
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:12.300
so they did but what did they

1154
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.900
do for the NIV in 2011? Well, they brought.

1155
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.600
in under the name NIV

1156
00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.300
they snuck in their gender neutrality, which they said

1157
00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:21.800
they wouldn't do.

1158
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.500
They brought in their gender neutrality. And now

1159
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.600
we have blessed is the one it's just one we fixed it. No,

1160
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.200
but it's not masculine. It's

1161
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.500
it's neutral.

1162
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.700
Okay, so

1163
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:40.000
How we feel about gender neutrality?

1164
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.300
is one thing

1165
00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.300
but I think we can agree that.

1166
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.700
Maybe the reasons why they're doing it. We're a

1167
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:51.400
little bit of a stretch.

1168
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.600
So as to not offend the modern reader.

1169
00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.700
Should we be worried about how God's word offends people?

1170
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:02.700
I don't think so.

1171
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.000
If God wrote it, I don't want to apologize for it.

1172
00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:11.200
Okay, so instead of apologizing for

1173
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.100
it, they change the wording now.

1174
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.800
Is this Psalm only talking about a male?

1175
00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:19.900
can only a male

1176
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.800
be affected and and in

1177
00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.900
is this only talking about a man? No.

1178
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:27.900
I think it's pretty clear.

1179
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.300
But again, so it's not the read it's not the it's not

1180
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:36.000
whether they did it. It's the reasons behind why they're

1181
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.500
doing it. So gender neutrality is one

1182
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.200
and I think people people tend to fall on either side of

1183
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:41.700
the camp.

1184
00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.600
Okay, and how you feel about it your opinions?

1185
00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.800
are valid but know that other people will disagree and

1186
00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.400
in some cases I can see both sides of this.

1187
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.300
But the reasons why we're doing this I believe is

1188
00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:57.600
off.

1189
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.500
The new King James the new King James of 1982.

1190
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.400
It was not an authorized revision of the King

1191
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:06.700
James.

1192
01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.100
It was not.

1193
01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:13.300
It was a work meant to modernize the

1194
01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.900
King James.

1195
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.100
Okay.

1196
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.900
The new King James is a very literal translation.

1197
01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.300
We don't have the V and The Vow

1198
01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.000
anymore of the King James.

1199
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.400
It's been updated. It's been modernized in its

1200
01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.200
language. It's still uses.

1201
01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:32.500
the textus receptus

1202
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.700
and it is the only Bible to my

1203
01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.600
knowledge or at least one of the very very rare and

1204
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.600
few Bibles that today.

1205
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.400
Still uses the textus receptus.

1206
01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.300
as its base text

1207
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.800
But it's a very literal and very good translation.

1208
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.100
The nrsv. So this is an update to the

1209
01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.100
RSV of 1950. So here in

1210
01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.000
1989 1990.

1211
01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.400
They wanted to modernize and put

1212
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.800
something out a little bit more for the scholars again, and

1213
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.100
you can see it's intended to serve as

1214
01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.400
a translation for devotional liturgical scholarly needs

1215
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.200
of the broadest number of religious adherents.

1216
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.700
Maybe maybe we're watering it down a little too much if that's

1217
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:20.100
our goal.

1218
01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:25.700
The version was most popular among liberal Scholars

1219
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.900
and in scholarly Publications, they continue

1220
01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.200
the trend of divorcing the old

1221
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.400
and a new testament that the RSV did

1222
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.400
and they now introduced gender neutrality.

1223
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.500
So here's some of their scholarly writings in Genesis

1224
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.100
1 2

1225
01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.300
The Earth was without form and void in the darkness was upon the face

1226
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.600
of the deep. And the spirit of God was moving they say a wind

1227
01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.500
from God was moving.

1228
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.200
Just because you can translate a word some way

1229
01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.400
doesn't mean you should.

1230
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.900
most English Bibles

1231
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.400
have continued on with the spirit, but this

1232
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.100
one was different.

1233
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.500
Matthew 18:15, I love this one. If your

1234
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.000
brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you and

1235
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.900
him alone. When you neutralize that it reads like this. If

1236
01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.500
another member of the church sins against you go

1237
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.200
and point out the Fault when the two of you are alone if the

1238
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.500
member listens to you, you have regained that one.

1239
01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:27.400
now

1240
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:32.500
Jesus tells us that we're brothers and sisters

1241
01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.700
were children of God.

1242
01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:38.600
By definition that's familial terms.

1243
01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.500
terminology

1244
01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.900
nothing is more intimate.

1245
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.100
Than family relations and that's why

1246
01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.800
we're given that terminology.

1247
01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:52.700
think of how

1248
01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.200
non-intimate this sounds

1249
01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.000
if that member

1250
01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:01.700
sins against me and we go and have a private discussion. I've

1251
01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:02.200
regained that one.

1252
01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.200
How personal is that? How intimate is

1253
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:07.500
that?

1254
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.300
That's not at all what Jesus was talking about. You

1255
01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.200
lose that intimacy for the sake of neutrality.

1256
01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:20.000
The new living is not an update to the living Bible. It is

1257
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.300
a original translation from the original but it

1258
01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.900
is a very paraphrased reading of

1259
01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.500
the original.

1260
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.700
And I think a very it's this second most popular

1261
01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.800
English Bible on unit sales.

1262
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.800
Okay, I've read the new living.

1263
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.200
Front to back it's very very good.

1264
01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.800
very good if you want to sit down and take in God's word and

1265
01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.400
you have a couple hours at a time and do

1266
01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.100
it boy, you'll

1267
01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:49.100
You'll get really close to the Lord. Just reading.

1268
01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.400
And not having the distractions of just reading his word. It's very

1269
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:53.900
readable.

1270
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.200
Now we get to the ESV. Who's the Bible we use in this church?

1271
01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.200
Okay.

1272
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.600
Very good very literal.

1273
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:03.800
but

1274
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.800
for sake of transparency, we'll point out that it also carries bias.

1275
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.900
It has a calvinistic bias to it. Okay, if

1276
01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.500
you have a more calvinist leaning theology,

1277
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.700
you probably don't mind or probably don't even notice this

1278
01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.200
but one example where it comes up is

1279
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.800
in the RSV. It says in first John three eight to

1280
01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.100
nine he who commits sin is of the devil.

1281
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.400
In the ESV it says he who makes a practice of sinning.

1282
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:35.900
Is of the devil?

1283
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.100
In verse 18 here at the bottom.

1284
01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.700
Of chapter 5 we know that anyone born of God does not sin that

1285
01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.900
is a literal translation of the Greek.

1286
01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.100
The ESV says we know that everyone who has been born

1287
01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.400
of God does not keep on sinning.

1288
01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.400
They have taken some Liberties here. Okay, they have used

1289
01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.700
this Calvin influence and they have expanded

1290
01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:02.300
and interpreted the text for you. The only

1291
01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.600
thing I would say that's

1292
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.200
That I don't particularly like of this and this is just me

1293
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:12.500
as I wish they would be open when doing so, okay. There

1294
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:15.600
are ways to say we have Supply these extra words in

1295
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.400
interpretation.

1296
01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.300
But they chose not to do that. So when we read it.

1297
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.200
We're expecting a literal translation, but we

1298
01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.800
don't always get it.

1299
01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.800
Okay, the message 2002.

1300
01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.800
I don't know what more to say about this and we're coming up on time, but

1301
01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.000
It is not the word of God.

1302
01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.700
the message by Eugene Peterson

1303
01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.300
Is more of a sermon?

1304
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.500
It's more of a devotional.

1305
01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.800
Than a rendition of God's word.

1306
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.200
See if this is The Lord's Prayer that you remember with a God Like

1307
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.400
This loving you. You can pray very simply like this.

1308
01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:00.700
Our Father in Heaven reveal who you are set the

1309
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:01.100
world, right

1310
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.600
Do what's best As Above So Below Keep

1311
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.600
Us Alive with three Square meals?

1312
01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:10.500
Keep us forgiven with you and forgiving others keep us

1313
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.400
safe from ourselves and the devil you're in

1314
01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.300
charge. You can do anything you want. You're Ablaze and

1315
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.500
Beauty. Yes. Yes.

1316
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:20.600
The Lord's Prayer

1317
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.200
courtesy of the message

1318
01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:27.900
you see how this is not a literal rendition of

1319
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.300
God's word. It is capturing the meaning of

1320
01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.000
this but more in a devotional.

1321
01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.100
Way, this is how a pastor would

1322
01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:38.400
preach through this rather than a reading of

1323
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.100
the word of God.

1324
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:43.500
A couple other ones here Jesus when

1325
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.100
he tells Nicodemus you must be born again to enter the Kingdom of

1326
01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.800
Heaven is very straightforward. Even if being born again is a difficult concept

1327
01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.400
to understand.

1328
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.800
But the message renders this this way Jesus said you're

1329
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.100
not listening. Let me say it again unless a

1330
01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:00.600
person submits to this original creation the

1331
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.100
wind hovering over the water Creation The Invisible

1332
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:06.300
moving the visible a baptism into

1333
01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:09.200
a new life. It's not possible to enter God's Kingdom.

1334
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.900
I don't know about you, but

1335
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.000
Jesus was a little bit more straightforward.

1336
01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.700
This becomes a little bit more cumbersome and I don't know if

1337
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.600
I'm coming or gone in this.

1338
01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.100
Is it harmful? I don't believe it's harmful. I just believe it's a little

1339
01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:28.700
confusing.

1340
01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.700
Okay, I think a lot of the message has good intentions, but

1341
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:35.200
it can come across rather confusion confusing.

1342
01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:40.400
Last one I'm going to go through is The Net Bible? Okay, 2005.

1343
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.300
So we're getting into this.

1344
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.400
Now into this century 21st century

1345
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.400
net is a kind of

1346
01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.800
a dual meaning net for new English translation

1347
01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.600
and net meaning internet.

1348
01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.400
It is a free online resource and

1349
01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.600
it was intended to be so.

1350
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.800
Okay, what's brilliant about this version is

1351
01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.900
all of its copious copious notes.

1352
01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:09.300
If you were at all interested in

1353
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.900
this series that we're talking about and want

1354
01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.200
to know more about why did a translator choose to

1355
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.900
translate it this way versus this way or which manuscripts does

1356
01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:21.500
have this reading versus that reading?

1357
01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:25.100
Well here is Psalms 1 and

1358
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.200
here are all the notes.

1359
01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.300
That they surround the text with that have

1360
01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.500
just that type of information in it 60,000 notes.

1361
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.500
In this translation headed up by people like Dan

1362
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.500
Wallace who's very much a text critic and very much up to

1363
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.400
speed on all the stuff that we've talked about in here.

1364
01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:49.400
And you have a lot of notes that you

1365
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.400
can get from this. They're all there and the printed version and

1366
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.800
they're all hyperlinked. I believe in the online version.

1367
01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.200
So take advantage of of that kind

1368
01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.200
of scholarship that is free and out there if you

1369
01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:01.600
want it.

1370
01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.300
all right, so

1371
01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.100
to summarize

1372
01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:10.000
and then we'll stop.

1373
01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:15.500
We have a spectrum don't we we have a spectrum.

1374
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:20.500
Of what I think are good reliable renderings

1375
01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.500
of God's word.

1376
01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.300
But there's a spectrum and this now comes down to

1377
01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.500
preference. What is it that you want?

1378
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.300
Do you want something that is what we would

1379
01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.300
call formal equivalents? Okay word for

1380
01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:37.400
word. Do you want something that's going to take every word that's in

1381
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.600
the Hebrew and the Greek and translated to an equivalent

1382
01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.600
English word.

1383
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.400
You can get that. Okay, we talked about The New

1384
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.100
American Standard being, you know, one of the best at that.

1385
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.900
What you sacrifice when you get that is readability.

1386
01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.600
It might be difficult to understand.

1387
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.100
It won't flow.

1388
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.900
Okay, but you will get word for word.

1389
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.500
On the other end of the spectrum we get the

1390
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.400
paraphrases and so you have on this end you have the message

1391
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:13.300
and the living Bible and the New Living Translation.

1392
01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.900
Okay, you have these you have these paraphrases where

1393
01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.200
you get thought for thought.

1394
01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:23.500
Instead of the word for word and what do you sacrifice you sacrifice

1395
01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.200
a lot of the ability to study.

1396
01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.200
You won't know which words are there just for

1397
01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.700
readability or which words were there for you know that were

1398
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:35.000
there in the originals? Okay, so you'll lose a little

1399
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:35.400
bit of that.

1400
01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:39.500
and then there are plenty of versions in the middle, which

1401
01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.700
Appear to draw from both of these. Okay, so there is a spectrum

1402
01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.100
from

1403
01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.300
Literal word for word, but without

1404
01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:52.300
the readability all the way to paraphrase thought

1405
01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.800
for Thought which are more readable but to sacrifice

1406
01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:56.600
the study.

1407
01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.600
aspect of the scripture

1408
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.500
So how do you choose and this will be our last slide of the

1409
01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:04.300
entire one?

1410
01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:06.800
Which one is best?

1411
01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:09.200
well

1412
01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.600
As you could probably guess I'm going to say it depends.

1413
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.500
It depends on what you want. What do you want?

1414
01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.300
And there's two things which I've recommended here for people

1415
01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.300
to do with regards to God's word.

1416
01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:26.700
How do you take it in? How do you ingest it two things?

1417
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.000
You can do want us to study.

1418
01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:29.800
And want us to soak.

1419
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.400
Okay, study and soak.

1420
01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.300
If you're going to study you're going to want a more word for

1421
01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:40.900
word. You're going to want a more formal equivalent translation of

1422
01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:41.200
the Bible.

1423
01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.100
Okay, if you're wanting to soak soak meaning.

1424
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.000
Taken afternoon off.

1425
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.300
Sit down in your lawn chair open up the Bible

1426
01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.100
and just read for hours.

1427
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.400
Soaking in God's word. You're going to want something that's a

1428
01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.100
little bit more readable.

1429
01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.900
Okay, but might not have the word for word.

1430
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.200
So which ones are best for study?

1431
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.200
well

1432
01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.800
the new King James ESV The New American Standard

1433
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.300
They're kind of leading the pack. Okay, they're leading the

1434
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.600
pack as far as their their balance between readability but

1435
01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.200
being fundamentally very good at being literal.

1436
01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.600
And word for word and containing aspects

1437
01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.000
in it that you can actually study.

1438
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.600
And get closer to the Lord.

1439
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.400
We've talked about which text do they use? Well,

1440
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.500
remember the ESV in The New American Standard used the critical

1441
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.400
text. The older manuscripts the new King

1442
01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.400
James the King James are going to use the Texas receptus.

1443
01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.400
the more modern manuscripts

1444
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.600
Okay, so that might be a personal preference but I think texture criticism

1445
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.300
has led us toward the accuracy of the older manuscripts.

1446
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:50.900
Okay.

1447
01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.500
So those can be some personal preference.

1448
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.300
So what I would recommend if you're

1449
01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.500
not even knowing where to start.

1450
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.200
if you just have

1451
01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:05.300
I've got this Bible, but is it is it the

1452
01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:08.400
right one? Is it the best one for me? What I would recommend if you're

1453
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.100
trying to study God's word.

1454
01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:15.600
And wanting to be faithful and you're not sure about the differences

1455
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.700
in the manuscripts and maybe we still don't understand that fully

1456
01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.400
and completely what I would recommend did you do?

1457
01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.100
Is just get side by side.

1458
01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.300
And ESV and a new King James.

1459
01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:30.500
If you want to start somewhere start out

1460
01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.800
with an ESV and a King James or New King James side

1461
01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.400
by side and read them and see how

1462
01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.000
different they are.

1463
01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.700
Knowing that they pull from different texts, but what you can be assure

1464
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.400
of and certain of is that while there

1465
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.300
are differences in those some verses will be at not in

1466
01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.100
one and they'll be any other.

1467
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.300
What you can be sure of.

1468
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.400
is that this is as wide of variance as

1469
01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:55.800
there is

1470
01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.600
there's nothing further out to the left or further

1471
01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.300
out to the right.

1472
01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:04.700
The differences in the ESV and the new King James are going

1473
01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.700
to be the widest that the variations

1474
01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:08.700
ever get.

1475
01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.400
So there's not going to be some new wild text

1476
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.100
out there somewhere and some other version. No the

1477
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.300
boundaries of the scripture.

1478
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.700
Can be seen in those two versions.

1479
01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.100
Or if you have a new American Standard compare that with the

1480
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:27.500
new King James or you want to do the Old

1481
01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:30.300
King James and the old American Standard you can do that, too.

1482
01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.700
But if you're wanting to study and wanting to know the differences in

1483
01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.500
God's word and how you can soak it in and how you can study.

1484
01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.900
This will be my recommendations for you.

1485
01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:44.200
We're at 7:30. I think they even wanted

1486
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.300
me to stop 10 minutes ago.

1487
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.400
But that is it. You guys have made it

1488
01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.000
for eight minus one seven weeks.

1489
01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.300
This has been very complicated stuff. You guys have been Troopers and

1490
01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:59.100
putting up with this. There's a lot that is just going to go over your

1491
01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:03.400
head. You need to hear it more than once, that's fine. Please email

1492
01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.200
me. Text me call

1493
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.500
me. Just stop me. If you have any questions about anything we covered.

1494
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.400
I would love to sit down with you and go over it

1495
01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:11.700
with you.

1496
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.300
But this has been a blast for me.

1497
01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.300
I've been encouraged by seeing you guys showing up

1498
01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.100
every week and taking this in. So thank you all very much.

1499
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.200
Appreciate it.
