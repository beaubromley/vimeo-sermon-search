00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.700
Well, good morning again beloved. It's good

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.100
to see you wide awake after getting woken up

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.900
by the storms this morning. I'm sure so glad you made it. We're taking

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.800
a bit of a break this week from our series

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.400
through Micah. It's the holiday weekend. And so

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.500
just kind of don't want anybody to miss out as we

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.200
walk through verse by verse in that book. And so we're gonna dive back

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.200
into the next Psalm up as we

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.800
take a decade's long journey through that book. We're now

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.300
three years into it. In fact, we are at one

11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.800
third of the way through it today as we pick up Psalm 50. So

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.300
take your copy of God's word and turn there with me find half

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.000
way and then turn left you get to Psalm 50 big number

14
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.800
50 in the Book of Psalms.

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.400
But here's what's funny as we just pick up the next one. That's up in

16
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.400
these kind of off weeks like this and it's really interesting

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.500
that what we're going to see in we didn't

18
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.200
plan it this way. But what Psalm 50 is going to show us

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.700
is it's very much like Micah the whole thing feels like

20
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.100
it sounds like it. There's a lot of the same kinds of

21
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.100
themes like God's people had turned

22
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.900
away judgment was coming. And so we're gonna see God's response

23
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.300
to his people as they rebelled and

24
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.000
really what we're going to press into today is what

25
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.400
true worship looks like.

26
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.300
that's the whole theme of Psalm 50 and what God was addressing here is

27
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300
what does true worship really look like

28
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.300
as we get into it today though this past Monday and Tuesday Emily and

29
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.500
I my wife got to attend a marriage retreat in

30
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.700
Oklahoma City and it's always good to get away kind of

31
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.500
a good time to just reconnect and spend focused time

32
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.600
together, but more importantly it does give us an opportunity to renew

33
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.200
our relationship now, we're in a great place.

34
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
We have always been in our marriage a great

35
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.200
place because we put the work into it, by the way. It doesn't just happen.

36
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200
You have to like regularly scheduled maintenance on your

37
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.500
car. You kind of need to just do some checkups along the way.

38
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.400
But as we were there I was thinking about my wedding

39
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.200
ring and we just had it of course right there

40
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.700
on my finger and just thinking about certain things but but really

41
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.500
thinking about how this hundred dollars stainless steel

42
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.300
band how this is a reminder

43
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.700
of the Covenant that we entered into

44
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.700
over 17 years ago in our

45
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.800
marriage.

46
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.100
And how it daily reminds me as I wear it

47
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.300
right here. It just daily reminds me of the things that

48
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.900
we committed to each other under God together.

49
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.800
Well, that's essentially what God is going to do with Psalm 50.

50
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.200
It's kind of like a spiritual marriage retreat with his

51
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.700
bride.

52
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.400
Where there's this desire he has to renew the

53
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.900
relationship.

54
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.700
To refresh what's been missing something that as

55
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.900
he speaks about this true worship idea.

56
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.300
He calls his people. He calls us he calls

57
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.000
them.

58
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.800
to this renewed relationship

59
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.500
So we're going to see here in Psalm 50

60
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.700
and we see right away versus 1 through 6 where God lays

61
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.900
out this appeal to his people.

62
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.400
It says the mighty one God the Lord

63
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.500
he speaks and summons the Earth from the rising of

64
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.500
the sun to its setting out of Zion the

65
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.900
Perfection of beauty God shines forth.

66
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.200
Our God comes he does not keep silence before

67
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.300
him as a devouring fire around

68
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.700
him a mighty Tempest

69
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.400
He calls to the heavens above and to the Earth that he

70
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.800
may judge his people.

71
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.800
Gather to me my faithful ones who made

72
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800
a covenant with me by sacrifice.

73
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.400
The heavens declare his righteousness for God

74
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.000
himself is Judge.

75
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500
Will stop there for a moment.

76
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.400
This first picture of God the author

77
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.500
paints it it sure sounds a lot like Micah 1

78
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.600
remember we walk through the start of it and just the picture

79
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.900
of God coming down from the mountain. This Mighty

80
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.600
God. It says Yahweh that he's showing

81
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.500
himself to be visibly strong. He's the

82
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.500
one overall the Transcendent one. He is

83
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.200
God.

84
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.200
But he calls to the whole earth here and

85
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.300
notice as he does that he's he's inviting every person

86
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.100
to listen to his words. He's inviting people to to

87
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.400
hear him as he does that though notice.

88
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.000
It's not a blessing that he's bringing.

89
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.800
It says he's coming verse 6 as judge.

90
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.400
Calls the whole earth. He's coming as judge and

91
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.500
Psalm 19:1 reminds us the same idea that

92
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.500
the heavens declare his righteousness that

93
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.600
he's a worthy judge. He does all things

94
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.800
right? That's the word justice. He does everything according to

95
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.100
the rightness of it.

96
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.100
In fact, the Hebrew word for righteousness here is sedek.

97
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.200
Which is a word that means everything in its right

98
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.600
order.

99
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.100
So righteousness Justice in some ways as well

100
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.500
is is everything as it should be?

101
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.400
It's really what Deuteronomy 32 verse 4

102
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.800
describes about God. This is back in the pinnitude

103
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.700
the first five books of the Bible. This is what Deuteronomy 32:4

104
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.400
describes about God. It says the rock

105
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.700
not Dwayne Johnson The Rock talking about God his

106
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.100
work is perfect.

107
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.500
It's right for all his ways are Justice.

108
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.400
A god of faithfulness without iniquity just and

109
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.600
upright is he that's that's righteousness. That's

110
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.500
God in himself as just

111
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.500
and the judge

112
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.400
And so he calls the whole earth and says hey, it's it's all

113
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.300
coming in to hear me as I

114
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.700
speak Justice I speak rightness.

115
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.600
But notice he makes a distinction in verse 5.

116
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.400
He says gather to me my faithful ones

117
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.000
who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

118
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.400
So he's not talking about all people in this moment. He's

119
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.600
talking about his people.

120
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.400
Those ones he has a special relationship with and he's calling them

121
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.200
out distinctly even as everybody gets to listen in

122
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.600
he calls them distinctly because something's out

123
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.900
of order in their relationship.

124
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.300
He wants to renew that relationship with his people.

125
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.200
In other words, they might have the name faithful.

126
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.300
But is it in name only?

127
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.900
Are they truly the faithful ones of God?

128
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.100
And so he's calling them back to renew that relationship. He's

129
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.300
calling his people to himself and

130
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.900
say hey, let's spend some time together. Let's talk.

131
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.700
And listen church. That's that's what he's doing for us every Sunday

132
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.300
in here.

133
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.200
As We Gather to worship him like this I pray that

134
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.400
it's not just as we'll see in a little bit not just what you do because

135
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.100
it's Sunday.

136
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.400
Not just a ritual we go through to make it

137
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.900
till lunch. He's summoning our hearts to

138
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.900
A Renewed relationship with him.

139
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.100
It's kind of like a wedding ring, right? It's a reminder of what that

140
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.200
Covenant means of marriage between me and my wife. This is

141
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.200
a reminder of what he's called us to and what

142
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.400
he's done for us.

143
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.500
And so what happens in here on Sundays, but remember that's also a

144
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.400
daily reminder.

145
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.400
Right. This this is a I don't just wear this on Sundays, right?

146
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.400
I wear this every day and God. Does that through

147
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.000
his word? Does that through his Spirit? He's a daily calling

148
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.600
us to be in renewed relationship

149
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.300
believer. Listen, you ought to feel God tugging on

150
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.500
your heart regularly.

151
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.300
Now you should feel him convicting you of

152
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.200
sin. So you repent and renew the relationship. You should

153
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.200
feel him drawing your heart to spend time

154
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.800
with him intimately regularly.

155
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.400
Quietly so, you know his heart and

156
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.600
you know that you're you're freely opening your heart to him.

157
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.100
He should be pulling your heart towards him in that.

158
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.200
If he's not if you don't feel that then you should

159
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.500
be concerned.

160
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.600
Let me just think about it was again me and my wife if

161
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.400
I never talk to her if I never spent time

162
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.000
with her never listen to her. We might still

163
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.300
be married doubtful. Right? We might still be

164
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.100
married, but there would be at least no relationship at all

165
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.100
between the two of us.

166
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.500
That's what God's doing. It's wanting us to renew the relationship

167
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.800
together. He's calling us back to him.

168
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.900
to renew that

169
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.300
Okay. So how do we do that?

170
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.400
He's called us. He says here's what we're going to talk about.

171
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.400
But how do we renew that? What's the heart issue that

172
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.600
God is wanting to address in his people here in Psalm

173
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:08.700
50.

174
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.500
Well, here's the first way we renew the relationship. It's through grateful worship.

175
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.000
through grateful worship

176
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.400
It's going to give us a couple more as we get into it. But grateful worship is the first

177
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.500
one look at verses 7 through 15. We'll

178
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.700
see this truth. It it starts with almost a satirical

179
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.800
reframing of the Shema and

180
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.400
Deuteronomy 6. He said hero people Israel. I am

181
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.600
your God. Here's what I want of you. He says something similar here,

182
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.400
but it's almost kind of a satire over that.

183
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.300
And notice as I read this there's a condition to what he's

184
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.500
talking about verses 7 through 15.

185
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.100
God says here o my people and I will

186
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.400
speak.

187
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.800
Oh Israel, I will testify against you. I am God your

188
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.300
God.

189
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.700
Now here it is. Not for your sacrifices. Do I rebuke you your

190
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.600
burnt offerings are continually before me I will

191
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.800
not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds

192
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.300
for every beast on the forest is mind the

193
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.200
cattle on a thousand hills. I know all the birds of the hills

194
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.200
all that moves and the field is mine. God says

195
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.600
if I were hungry, I would not tell you for the world and it's fullness

196
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.500
our mind.

197
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.200
Do I eat the Flesh of bulls or drink the blood of

198
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:26.800
goats?

199
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.500
No, basically, he says instead offer to

200
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.500
God a sacrifice of Thanksgiving.

201
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.800
Perform your vows to the most high.

202
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.300
Call upon me in the day of trouble.

203
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.600
I will deliver you and you shall glorify me.

204
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.500
Now to get what he's saying here, you have to understand the sacrificial

205
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.600
system and the way that God set up

206
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.100
worship to be done at this

207
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.300
time. Right? There were laws that were happening all

208
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.000
throughout that the first five books about we go read those there were

209
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.200
laws for when and how people were

210
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.400
to bring animals to sacrifice at the temple

211
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.100
mainly because they needed forgiveness. And this was the

212
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.300
way God set it up to work and the only way he would forgive was

213
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.700
through the shedding of blood.

214
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.300
Because the penalty for sin is death and so

215
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.400
something had to die. Thankfully it could be a substitute.

216
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.600
Didn't have to be you every single time. It could be a substitute. But

217
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.400
what they had to do is they had to keep bringing those animals to

218
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.700
regularly cover their sins.

219
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.500
She got that side of the sacrifices. Then there were

220
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.500
feasts and festivals. It would bring more animals and more animals like

221
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.300
they were just a lot of blood. Can you imagine how much that was happening

222
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.000
all day every day?

223
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.700
That's what God said it up to be.

224
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.400
But notice in this passage that God's not referring in verse

225
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.400
8 to the actual practice of making those

226
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.400
sacrifices because he says you're doing it right you

227
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.900
actually get the logistics right is what he says.

228
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.000
You're doing the practice correctly?

229
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.400
But here's why he was not accepting their sacrifices.

230
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.100
Because they didn't care about their own spiritual condition.

231
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.700
In fact, they were trying to manipulate God through the

232
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.100
sacrifice. It's like we can do whatever we want as long

233
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.700
as we do these rules right long as we sacrifice right God's gonna

234
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.400
be okay with us.

235
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.200
Because apparently what this comes from is they had started

236
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.600
to believe The Narrative of other false religions

237
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.800
around them that sacrifices met

238
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.700
some kind of a need in that God.

239
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.300
and their God

240
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.200
my wife and I went to India in 2007 and

241
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.900
we saw it there.

242
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.800
That there were shrines everywhere.

243
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.700
hundreds upon hundreds in every

244
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.700
corner of the city

245
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.400
And what people would do is they would bring food to these

246
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.900
Idols to feed that God.

247
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.500
but the problem was

248
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.300
you walk around back and you see the caretaker of whatever Shrine that

249
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.500
is and he just taking baskets of that food and just dumping it

250
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.200
in the alley.

251
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.200
And monkeys and dogs and whatever else would come and eat

252
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.400
it and they believe that the God form would

253
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.300
take on a dog or a monkey form and and what

254
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.200
he did and that's what it needed was to be provided for.

255
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.600
but if it's a true God

256
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.600
does it need Provisions, right?

257
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.700
That's what he says here in verses 10 through 13. The true.

258
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.700
God doesn't need anything. He says every Beast.

259
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.100
On the forest is mine the cattle in a thousand hills.

260
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.700
I know all the birds of the hills all that moves in the field is mine.

261
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.900
It's like I already got everything I need I don't need anything from you.

262
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.300
If I were hungry, I wouldn't tell you because the world like if

263
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.800
I really didn't need to eat which is a a question that assumes no

264
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.100
to that answer right if I did need to eat.

265
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.400
I wouldn't tell you could already have all everything. I need the world is fullness or

266
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.500
mind. Do I eat the Flesh of bulls drink the blood of goats? Like I don't even

267
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.600
eat like you do. So, why are you trying to provide

268
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.500
for me?

269
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.400
It's the same thing. The Apostle Paul said in Athens in Acts

270
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.400
chapter 17. He says verse 24 The God

271
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.200
Who made the world and everything in it being Lord of Heaven

272
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.900
and Earth does not live in temples made by human hands nor

273
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.400
is he served by human hands as though he needed

274
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:27.700
anything.

275
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.800
Since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath

276
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.300
and everything. It's the same thing. We saw in

277
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.300
India, right? He's like you don't need to feed God. He doesn't need

278
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.200
anything. In fact gives you everything you have.

279
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.200
So what all this is saying?

280
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.300
What God is saying to his people is that you can't put me on a starvation

281
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.800
diet to get what you want.

282
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.900
Give or not just to get you in my stead here

283
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.500
in my debt. That's not how this works. He

284
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.700
doesn't need anything from us.

285
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.200
So what does he want from us?

286
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.100
What did he want from them?

287
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.400
verse 14 offer to God a sacrifice

288
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.700
of Thanksgiving

289
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.500
you might say that differently make Thanksgiving your sacrifice to

290
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:17.600
God.

291
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.100
Perform your vows to the most high call upon me in the

292
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.300
day of trouble. I will deliver you and you shall glorify me.

293
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.400
What he wants is grateful worship.

294
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.400
grateful worship

295
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.800
He doesn't want us to just go through the motions.

296
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.400
To just do the rituals to sing

297
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.900
or to give without having to Heart behind it.

298
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.100
It's not what he wants.

299
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.400
You can do all that you can do it. Right and he doesn't want it. He doesn't accept it

300
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.600
because this is what he wants. He wants a living relationship with

301
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.400
us not just dead formalism where we

302
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.200
go through all the things we supposed to do because that's the

303
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.900
way we grew up doing it. No, he wants a living relationship and

304
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.600
he's given us worship as an outlet for

305
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.900
that for us to express our gratitude to

306
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.200
him.

307
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.800
And notice here, it has nothing to do with

308
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.500
with style with contemporary or

309
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.200
traditional or whatever any sort of style because

310
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.500
we should be able to worship God no matter the style.

311
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.700
This is because this this worship has

312
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.300
nothing to do with that. It has everything to do with our hearts.

313
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.200
with gratitude

314
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.600
with Thanksgiving. He says as our sacrifice of

315
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.000
worship and praise to God.

316
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.400
Because Ephesians 5 19 and 20 says we are to sing

317
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.900
and make Melody to the Lord with your heart.

318
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.200
Giving thanks always and for everything to

319
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.000
God the Father the name of Lord Jesus Christ.

320
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.000
Like singing is just giving thanks for

321
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.600
everything to our God.

322
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.400
That's the essence of worship Church.

323
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.900
Which if we start thinking about that way?

324
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.800
That means it goes way beyond Sunday mornings, right?

325
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.500
I guess not just about what happens in here. It

326
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.800
includes this. Yes that this is not just a formalistic ritual

327
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.100
that we come together and we sing a few songs

328
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.800
because that's what we do on Sundays.

329
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.500
This is not just like an entertainment venue where

330
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.300
you merely watch and then judge if you liked it or

331
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.000
not. That's not what this is about. This is us singing

332
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.100
Praise out of thankfulness in our

333
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:37.900
hearts to God.

334
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.200
And because that's who he is and because that's

335
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.200
what he's done. Then really if our hearts are

336
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.100
right worship should explode in this room, right?

337
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.700
Like if we know that we have nothing else, but

338
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.000
him.

339
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.500
In the end nothing else then our Thanksgiving should just

340
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.800
pour out of our lives here.

341
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.700
I remember hearing the story of Believers in the underground Church

342
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.400
in China.

343
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.400
Where they travel hours just to meet

344
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.700
together once a month maybe once a quarter.

345
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.300
Just a few other believers that they know of and they they

346
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.300
meet in different locations. So they can't be tracked and and the

347
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.100
whole process of that they also as they meet together. They

348
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.400
can't even Sing Out Loud because if someone heard them singing out

349
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.100
loud, they would get turned in and arrested.

350
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.200
So what they do?

351
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.900
Is they just simply mouth the words

352
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.400
of the praise songs?

353
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.800
Maybe Whispering if anything.

354
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.400
But they're just looking around at each other and they're all in unison

355
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.800
and singing these songs together.

356
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.200
without any noise coming out

357
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.000
yet as they do that.

358
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.500
They are just weeping in gratitude for what

359
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.800
God has done for them.

360
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.800
They literally have nothing else yet.

361
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.200
They're so thankful in their worship.

362
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.600
Would you be willing to worship like that?

363
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.200
Would you be willing to Worship in

364
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.200
a situation where you're at fear for your life? You don't

365
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.100
know who's coming through that door. You got a special knock to make sure they get

366
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.500
in right like all of the would you be willing to Worship in a way that you're you're

367
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.100
never gonna be entertained by that you're never gonna

368
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.300
enjoy preferentially one way or the other you are just looking at

369
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.400
each other knowing Jesus is all we have.

370
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.900
Or would you jump ship real fast? Because this is just not enough for me.

371
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.700
It's how to check our hearts in this right. Here's another way to check your heart even even

372
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.600
as we gather together in this room like this regularly

373
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.600
is your heart unmoved as we sing and

374
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.100
as we preach the gospel.

375
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.600
Like are you completely disengaged over what we're

376
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.300
doing towards God. Are you more

377
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.600
focused on preference or Nostalgia than

378
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.300
we are at responding to Jesus and

379
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.300
what he's done for us?

380
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.000
See what we're trying to do here every week is we're trying to facilitate

381
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.100
true worship. We're not just going through the

382
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.900
motions. We're not just here to put on a show for other people.

383
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.200
And I know there might be elements. You don't prefer every week as We

384
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.200
Gather, but what you can address is your own heart.

385
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.300
That's what you can control and your heart. What

386
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.400
is my intent? Why am I here? What are we doing here? What am

387
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.400
I supposed to be doing here?

388
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.400
Because worship is not just to make you feel better.

389
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.500
Worship is not just to impress other people around

390
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.800
you that they think better about you. You must

391
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.100
remember I must remember it's so easy for me

392
00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.100
to go through the motions.

393
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.700
I must remember that this is for the

394
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.300
Lord. I'm responding to him in

395
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:09.700
this.

396
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.400
again, though

397
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.500
Yes, it has implications for what we do in here but it also has

398
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.300
implications beyond Sunday mornings, right?

399
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.300
that really

400
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.300
when I say you are sent at the end of worship Gathering worship

401
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.200
never really ended.

402
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.400
We don't end worship. You see what I mean by that right

403
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.300
worship never really ends. I mean, just listen to

404
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.300
the way Romans 12:1 says this

405
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.300
I appeal to you therefore by the

406
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.700
mercies of God to present your bodies

407
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.500
as a Living Sacrifice.

408
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.600
Holy and acceptable to God, which is your

409
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.900
spiritual worship.

410
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.000
whole self

411
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.800
Is God's desired sacrifice now?

412
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.600
not animals

413
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.700
not just actions

414
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.400
Your whole self and what motivates that he

415
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.100
says, I appeal to you by the mercies of God.

416
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.200
It's the mercy of God that you

417
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.000
deserve God's judgment and he gave you Mercy instead that

418
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.000
God put the Judgment you deserve on Jesus instead.

419
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.400
That he's a sufficient substitute his blood on that

420
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.100
altar covers it all you don't have to keep giving it. You don't have

421
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.500
to keep bringing animals. You've got all of it covered. That's what

422
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.400
motivates worship.

423
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.300
Because again worship is not just singing. That's what motivates Worship in

424
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.300
every corner as a Living Sacrifice.

425
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.500
A spiritual worship to God is through this.

426
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.400
And so just like I said our praise in here should

427
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.300
explode because of the mercy of God,

428
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.300
we should live differently because of the mercy of

429
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:05.700
God as well.

430
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.300
I just again I keep going back that the image

431
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.900
you should think today is marriage wedding ring relationship. Just

432
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.400
like I want to sing the Praises of my wife.

433
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:20.900
And live differently.

434
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.600
For her is because she's loved me so well.

435
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.100
And I look at that and I think how else should I

436
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.200
respond to that? Should I take advantage of that should take take it for

437
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.100
granted? No, I should change everything because I

438
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.300
want to honor her.

439
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.200
How much more true Is that real true in our relationship

440
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:42.900
with God?

441
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.600
She's an imperfect example of

442
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.300
of love. Yes.

443
00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.000
God is not. He has loved us perfectly. That's

444
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.900
why it says we should want to glorify him

445
00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.200
right the end of verse 15. I'll deliver you you

446
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.200
shall glorify me. That's what we should want to do

447
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.600
as we sing in here as we live out there.

448
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.200
And the more you do it out there the easier it is to do it in here.

449
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.600
that fuels this

450
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.900
so worship is what God wants from us.

451
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.600
grateful worship

452
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.100
but along those lines see he's calling this

453
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.200
renewal of a relationship in Psalm 50, but he raises

454
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.600
another issue along those lines this time directed

455
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.400
at those who claimed his name but lived

456
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.800
in opposition lived otherwise

457
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.700
continue on look at verse 16 down through 22

458
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.100
But to the wicked God says now

459
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.200
this is not Wicked people out there. This is

460
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.200
wicked people of his who are supposed to be the faithful ones, right?

461
00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.200
But to the wicked God says what right have you

462
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.400
to recite my statutes or take my Covenant

463
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.200
on your lips?

464
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.500
For you hate discipline and you cast my words behind you.

465
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.700
If you see a thief you're pleased with him, you keep company

466
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.500
with adulterers. You give your mouth free

467
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.800
reign for evil your tongue frames deceit you sit

468
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.000
and speak against your brother.

469
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.700
You slander your own Mother's Son.

470
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.700
These things you have done and I've been silent.

471
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.200
You thought that I was one like yourself, but now I

472
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.700
rebuke you and lay the charge before you.

473
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.300
Mark this then you who forget God.

474
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.900
Lest I tear you apart and they're be none to deliver.

475
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.100
Again, this sounds a lot like Micah, right?

476
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.200
That these supposed Covenant people of

477
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.800
God. We're taking the grace and mercy of God and stomping on

478
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.100
it as if it were trash.

479
00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.200
That's why God calls them to renew the

480
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.500
relationship here through sincere obedience.

481
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.300
Grateful worship was part of it that they

482
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.800
should respond and do things the right-heartedly in right-hearted

483
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.500
ways. But then now since you're obedience is

484
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.000
another way to renew that relationship.

485
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.400
Because he says it here.

486
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.900
That these people these Wicked ones had God's Commandments

487
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.300
on their walls had God's commandment

488
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.500
in their history, but had none of God's Commandments in

489
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.000
their hearts.

490
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.100
It's verse 17 you cast my words behind you.

491
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.700
It would be like if I took this wedding ring and just tossed

492
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:40.800
it.

493
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:41.900
Forget it.

494
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.600
It's what they're doing here.

495
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.200
Because remember in the Covenant agreement God made with them

496
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.600
at Mount Sinai The Ten Commandments Moses comes

497
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.200
off the mountain and says here's the ten rules to live

498
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.000
by here's here's God's covenant with us. This is

499
00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.600
what he asked of us things. Like do not steal do not

500
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.700
commit adultery. Do not lie. The basic ones, right?

501
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.200
What were these people doing?

502
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.300
They were encouraging stealing.

503
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.100
They were hanging out with adulterers and just saying no big deal.

504
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.400
They were speaking evil speaking lies speaking slander

505
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.200
against their own family.

506
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.200
Just the exact opposite of what God

507
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:24.700
Said to do.

508
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.500
And that's bad enough, of course, but just like we saw with Micah these

509
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.400
people didn't think God was going to do anything about it.

510
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.500
He's gracious, right? He's kind. He's patient. That's

511
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.900
who God is that's his character. That's God. He's good.

512
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.300
gross miscalculation, right

513
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.300
look at verses 21 and 22 again. God says to

514
00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.100
them these things you have done and I have been silent.

515
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.700
You thought that I which you can even phrase

516
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.500
that in the original language you thought that the I am

517
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.400
right Yahweh. You thought that I was one

518
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.200
like yourself you thought that the I am

519
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.500
Yahweh would just like you.

520
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.400
But now I rebuke you lay the charge before you mark this

521
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.200
you who forget God lest. I tear you apart. They're being

522
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:17.900
none to deliver.

523
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.500
In other words God is saying here I made this

524
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.300
Covenant with you. I am God.

525
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.400
There's a faithful response to that Covenant, but

526
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.000
what you're doing is not it.

527
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.400
What you are doing so-called faithful ones is not

528
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.300
being faithful and so judgment was

529
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.100
coming.

530
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.800
Remember Church Romans 2:4 says that we must not presume

531
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.300
upon the riches of his

532
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.100
kindness and forbearance and patience.

533
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.200
what that means is that

534
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.400
when God gives us.

535
00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.900
Grace it should lead us to repentance.

536
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.600
To not take advantage of his Mercy.

537
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.300
So since for them and for us God has

538
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.300
not brought full judgment yet.

539
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.200
What should our response be to him?

540
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.800
Well, it's just like back in Micah we saw.

541
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:22.900
Turn back to him.

542
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.500
insincere obedience

543
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.600
if you're running astray One Direction wrongly

544
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.100
he says turn around and go the other way.

545
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.300
Sincere obedience. It's a whole idea behind the word. Holy.

546
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.200
We sing it we talk about it the word holy means that

547
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.100
God has set apart his people to be

548
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.500
distinct to be different than the world around

549
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.400
us to show him off that we are his people.

550
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.500
Which by the way is how Romans 12 continues?

551
00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.100
verse 2 after this call to be

552
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.400
a Living Sacrifice verse 2

553
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.700
says then do not be conformed to

554
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.200
this world.

555
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.300
To fall into the mold of the world around us

556
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.300
don't be conformed but be transformed by the

557
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.600
renewal of your mind.

558
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.600
That by testing you may discern what is the will of God what is good and acceptable

559
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.200
and perfect?

560
00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.500
What that means is that sincere obedience

561
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.900
we're talking about here that God is calling us to is a desire

562
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.900
to follow God's will to follow God's plan

563
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.900
with every part of my life every

564
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.900
action every thought every inner response

565
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.500
every outer response. It's all saying

566
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.400
God. I want your will not mine. I want your plan not

567
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.900
mine. You're in charge, not me.

568
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.300
Sincere obedience is a desire to follow his will.

569
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.100
That's what for Samuel 15:22 says.

570
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.200
God says has the Lord as great Delight in

571
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.500
burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying

572
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.100
the voice of the Lord.

573
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.200
Behold to obey is better than sacrifice.

574
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.200
Meaning you could bring all of these animals you want.

575
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.000
Obedience is more faithful to God.

576
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.300
That's what he wants more than all

577
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.300
of the rituals that we go through.

578
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.300
But again, let me be clear about something.

579
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.500
Notice the point here.

580
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.900
Was Not Mere obedience

581
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.200
Because what can happen is that can get weird where we

582
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.300
start to try to earn our Salvation. We do it just because

583
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.800
we have to or whatever and you just say obedience. That's it.

584
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.200
No, remember God's calling us to sincere obedience.

585
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.500
Because like we saw with worship true worship

586
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.200
comes from the heart. It comes from inside of

587
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.600
you out to the rest of people and world

588
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.300
and all the outs external actions, right?

589
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.600
It comes from inside first same with this obedience comes should

590
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.700
come from the heart. It should come up from inside

591
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.600
of you because you want to because you're

592
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.500
grateful for what God has done for you. That's what

593
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.600
obedience come that's sincere obedience.

594
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.800
And so just like with worship.

595
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.600
It's not enough to fill the air with raised hands

596
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.500
and and swelling choruses if we're not

597
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.700
concerned with truth and equity and justice.

598
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.000
for not concerned about giving effort towards

599
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.100
applying his word.

600
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.500
To obeying God like if we're not doing that out

601
00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.600
there, he's looking at this like this will aim is five says God

602
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.400
says this take away from me the noise of

603
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.200
your songs.

604
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.800
To The Melody of your Harps. I will not listen.

605
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.800
But let Justice roll down like Waters and

606
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.600
righteousness.

607
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.600
like an Ever flowing stream

608
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.100
Saying you can come in here and raise your hands and sing We have

609
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.300
greatest music in the whole history of the church. We can do all of that.

610
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.400
He said but if you're not trying to live out the faith

611
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.500
out there. I'm not even listening.

612
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.500
Obedience is just as much worship.

613
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.700
It's from the heart sincere obedience

614
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.300
is worship too because just like

615
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.700
singing should be a grateful response to his grace. Your obedience

616
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.900
should be a grateful response to his grace, too.

617
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.000
I just think about it.

618
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.100
How else should I respond to the one who

619
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.800
lived the perfect life I couldn't live.

620
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.200
Who died the death I deserved.

621
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.400
Who defeated the enemy of sin and death? I could never defeat on

622
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.300
my own how else should I respond to that?

623
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.500
But that church is where it starts that is where it

624
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.200
starts.

625
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.400
Because Psalm 50 ends this marriage retreat.

626
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.300
By saying you renew the

627
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.400
relationship first and foremost through

628
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.500
humble faith.

629
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.800
through humble faith

630
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.200
It's in verse 23. It's what grounds the rest of it.

631
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.300
This is how he ends he's just talked judgment. He just said

632
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.000
all the things verse 23. He says the one who offers Thanksgiving

633
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.500
as his sacrifice glorifies me.

634
00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.700
To one who orders his way. Rightly. I

635
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.000
will show the salvation of God.

636
00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.200
Again, this is not saying you can earn your salvation in any way.

637
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.700
That's still a gift. Yes, but remember the context.

638
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.400
They were bringing sacrifices for the

639
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:01.900
wrong reason.

640
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.200
They were trying to manipulate God. They

641
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.500
were bringing it as ritual. There was nothing in their heart that

642
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.300
was driving it. It was not sincere in

643
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.200
any way. That's why God says the one who glorifies him is the

644
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.900
one who offers Thanksgiving as a sacrifice.

645
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.400
That's true worship. The one who comes with a

646
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.500
grateful heart for all that. God has done. That's the

647
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.000
faith side of this equation.

648
00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.000
Right you are saying.

649
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.000
And you know in your heart at the deepest part of

650
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:34.700
Who You Are.

651
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.300
That you are joyful over what God has

652
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.300
done in your place.

653
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.000
That you trust his work in your place. That's

654
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:47.500
faith

655
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.600
Right, that's trust in him in your place that

656
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.600
is core to all of this working as

657
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.300
it should but then he says this other phrase. He says

658
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.500
the one who orders his way rightly.

659
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.500
It's the same word as righteousness back

660
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:09.500
in verse 6 that God is righteousness. Now,

661
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.300
we order our way rightly.

662
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.400
And so we now align our

663
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.200
lives with God's right way.

664
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.500
That's what he means by this with God's path

665
00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.900
with God's direction. We align our lives with

666
00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:29.800
it. So we got the faith. Peace. This here

667
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.100
is the humble.

668
00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:31.900
piece

669
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.300
because to align your life with God's plan you have to acknowledge that

670
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.600
his plan is better than yours.

671
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.900
His plan is right and yours is often wrong.

672
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.600
That you are acknowledging. He's

673
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.400
in charge what he says goes I submit

674
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.200
to him and his way is not try to make him submit to my ways.

675
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.000
It's humble faith.

676
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.200
But again, that's true worship, right?

677
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.600
Where you are, so grateful for his salvation that you

678
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.500
die to yourself.

679
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.400
That you you allow him to direct your life.

680
00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.500
That you prioritize what he says to prioritize that

681
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.500
is true worship.

682
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.700
And you do what Hebrews 13?

683
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.300
Verses 15 and 16 says that in light of what Jesus has

684
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.000
done then through him. Let us continually offer

685
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.000
up a sacrifice of praise to

686
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.200
God.

687
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.500
That is the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.

688
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.500
Not just that we talk about him.

689
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.100
But we acknowledge his name same with Proverbs 3

690
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.200
you give him the credit for what he is doing

691
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.400
in your life you follow him as your lead that's

692
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.700
acknowledging his name and then verse 16 says practically

693
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.500
do not neglect to do good and to share what

694
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.000
you have for such sacrifices are

695
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.000
pleasing to God.

696
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.000
This is true worship.

697
00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.200
So, how is God?

698
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.800
Calling you back to him today.

699
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.400
How does he want to renew that relationship with you?

700
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.000
