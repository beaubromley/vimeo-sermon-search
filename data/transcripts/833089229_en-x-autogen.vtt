00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.090
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.450
I will not fear for you are with me. You are my light and my salvation.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.890
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.170
I long to dwell in your house forever.

5
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.943
Good morning,

6
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.090
I went to sleep with gum in my mouth and now there's gum in my hair.

7
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.570
And when I got outta bed this morning,

8
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.250
I tripped on the skateboard and I can tell it was going to be a terrible,

9
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.490
horrible, no good, very bad day.

10
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.330
There were lima beans for dinner. I hate lima beans.

11
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.610
There was kissing on tv. I hate kissing.

12
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.130
My bath was too hot. I got soap in my eyes.

13
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.610
My marble went down the drain.

14
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.810
The Mickey Mouse nightlight burned out and I bit

15
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.850
my tongue. It has been a terrible,

16
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.930
horrible, no good, very bad day.

17
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.200
Now, if you know your great literature,

18
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.320
you recognize Alexandra in the horrible, no good, very bad day.

19
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.200
My wife is an elementary teacher and she helped me prepare for this and get

20
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.400
this, get that ready.

21
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.520
I just want you to know that the horrible, no good,

22
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.840
very bad day is a very AP description of Psalm

23
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.480
55. And that's where we are this morning. Uh,

24
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.800
we've had some really fabulous messages up to this point. And,

25
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.000
and after me follow the Psalms, it'll be 56 next and on down.

26
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.240
But I get chapter 55 of, of Psalm, uh, Psalm 55. And uh,

27
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.000
just turn there with me if you would.

28
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.760
And this little poem is an AP description of Psalm 55

29
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.560
because Psalm 55 is just not much fun.

30
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.520
It's a, uh, psalm where David takes off and,

31
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.040
and you see that there's some psalms that are fun. You know, the 23rd Psalm,

32
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.873
the Lord is my shepherd.

33
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.960
I shall not want Psalm 100 make a joyful noise under the Lord.

34
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.720
All he lands come before his presence with singing. Those are fun Psalms.

35
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.080
Those are beautiful psalms. Those are Psalms you memorize.

36
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.160
I don't know anybody in the world who's ever memorized Psalm 55.

37
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.000
Uh, it's just hard. Psalm 55 deals with a lot of emotion.

38
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.160
And this morning we're going to take a look at that and see these emotions.

39
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.520
David is so concerned about this psalm when he starts it,

40
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.880
he uses very emotional words. And he says to God,

41
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.720
give ear a tend to enter me.

42
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.640
Listen to me. And when he addresses God,

43
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.440
he addresses God as Elohim.

44
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.600
Elohim is the name for God as mighty creator.

45
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.320
David is looking for a powerful God.

46
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.200
He's looking for a God who gets things done and that's who he addresses.

47
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.880
And so David is distracted

48
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.840
by a noisy world. We're gonna see that he's distracted by a noisy world.

49
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.480
We're gonna look at verses one through 15 of Psalm 55.

50
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.730
Give ear to my prayer of God and hide not yourself from my

51
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.250
plea for mercy. Attend to me and answer me.

52
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.010
I am restless in my complaint.

53
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.170
And I moan because of the noise of the enemy,

54
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.290
because of the oppression of the wicked. For they drop trouble upon me.

55
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.370
And in anger, they bear grudge against me.

56
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.690
My heart is in anguish within me.

57
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.530
The the terrors of death have fallen upon me.

58
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.530
Fear and tremblings come upon me and horror overwhelms me.

59
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.250
And I say, oh, that I had wings like a dove. I would fly away and be at rest.

60
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.850
Yes, I would wander far away. I would lodge in the wilderness.

61
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.290
I would hurry to find a shelter from the raging wind in tempest,

62
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.410
destroy. Oh Lord,

63
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.970
divide their tongues for I see violence and strife in the city.

64
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.490
Day and night, they go rounded on its walls and iniquity and trouble are within.

65
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.330
It ruined in its midst.

66
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.210
Oppression and fraud do not depart from its marketplace.

67
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.490
For it is not an enemy who tuns me that I could then I could bear it.

68
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.210
It is not an adversary who deals instantly with me, then I can hide from him.

69
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.490
But it is you, a man, my equal,

70
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.210
my companion, my familiar friend.

71
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.570
We used to take sweet council together within God's house.

72
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.370
We walked in the throng, let death steal over them,

73
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.250
let them go down to shield alive for evil is in their dwelling place

74
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.690
and in their heart,

75
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.180
David is distracted by a very noisy world.

76
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.220
Now, this, this, this psalm of David does not have dates.

77
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.380
It doesn't tell specific places,

78
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.700
events even doesn't even tell who the friend who was that betrayed him.

79
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.820
And there's a reason at the very beginning, David says,

80
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.260
he says, in to the choir, master with stringed instruments,

81
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.220
a mask of David.

82
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.000
Now a mask is a teaching song.

83
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.600
This is Psalm 55 is a musical. It's what it is.

84
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.800
It's a musical. It was written with stringed instruments in mind.

85
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.680
We don't have the score of the music, but we have the manuscript,

86
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.880
we have the singing for the, the word part of the singing.

87
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.720
And we don't know what the, we don't know what the music sounded like.

88
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.920
And it was probably a chant with string instruments. We don't know. We,

89
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.000
we don't know what it was. But it is a musical as a mask.

90
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.280
It's a musical for teaching.

91
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.080
And that is what David seeks to do with this song.

92
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.680
So when he sang this inside of, of their,

93
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.000
their center for that,

94
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.000
people were listening and they were learning what David had to say.

95
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.960
Now this is real, but David wants to make this lesson.

96
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.760
So David beg,

97
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.600
his song begins as a cacophony.

98
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.320
That's a real fancy word for noise. It is a cacophony,

99
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.600
it's a discordant mixture of sounds,

100
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.520
dissonance and harshness.

101
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.560
It's like the six o'clock news. That's what it's like.

102
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.620
Am I not working? Yo, y'all can hear me.

103
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.620
Can't you hear me? More or less? All right, well that is better.

104
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.340
Thank you. That's the boss, by the way. So, hi,

105
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.020
this is noise. It's what it is. A cacophony is just noise. It's,

106
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.980
it's discordant.

107
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.340
And so David is telling a story with this music.

108
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.380
He's having problems. So David gives his complaint.

109
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.940
Here's the complaint that David gave. This is David's complaint.

110
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.140
In verses three, nine and 11, there was noise, oppression, trouble,

111
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.380
anger, grudge, violence, strife, iniquity, fraud, ruin, war.

112
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.620
All of these things were going on in this song.

113
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.620
And so this was David's complaint.

114
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.580
His emotions were, he was restless. There was anguish,

115
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.020
terror, fear, trembling, horror,

116
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.580
oppression. All of these were the feelings.

117
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.940
These were the emotions that he had about what was going on in this,

118
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.660
in this psalm. And then here was his reaction. I like his reaction. He said,

119
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.740
I want to fly away. I want to wander far away.

120
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.660
I want to lodge in the wilderness and I want to find a

121
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.810
shelter to hide. Now

122
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.740
this psalm is difficult and it talks about

123
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.380
bad things. And it was written 3000 years ago.

124
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:43.020
It's 3000 years old. And folks, I, in looking at this and reading,

125
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.940
this is the first time I've ever preached Psalm 55. But in studying this,

126
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.900
I came to realize at Psalm 55, those 3000 years old,

127
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.160
it is more appropriate to our lives today

128
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.290
than it may have been in the days of David,

129
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.320
because we live in a world full of noise.

130
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.840
We live in a world of discord, of dissonance and harshness.

131
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.920
It's just everywhere. And so here's, here's what he does. He,

132
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.280
he says, we live in this and this is difficult. Now we have,

133
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.920
we have schedules, we have calendars, we have lists, we have tasks,

134
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.320
we have bills, we have decisions, we have interruptions, we have attacks,

135
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.640
betrayal, criticism, crisis, fear.

136
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.000
And that's just the short list of what we have in our lives.

137
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.520
We live in a mean world. We live in a world of anger,

138
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.040
hateful words and actions. And it comes to the point where we say to God,

139
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.080
God, Lord, sovereign,

140
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.570
would you please deliver us from all this

141
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.370
noise and all these issues? You know, I'm a,

142
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.170
I pastored for 40 years and then I retired and my wife and

143
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.650
I moved to Edmonds so I could be with my kids and mainly my grandkids.

144
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.370
But we came here to live and this is what we wanted to do. I was here for just,

145
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.370
I was retired for about three months and I became a hospice chaplain.

146
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.290
And I've been a hospice chaplain for three years.

147
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.490
And we had a meeting the other day and one of our hospice nurses was sitting

148
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.650
beside me. And, and, uh, she is a sweetheart. She is a great nurse,

149
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.010
compassionate, kind, always gentle,

150
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.650
always fun to be around and just the neatest lady in the world.

151
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.610
And we got up and was getting ready to leave. And I said, well,

152
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.770
how are you doing?

153
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.940
And it was more of just a kind of a generous little tip, my hat to you.

154
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.100
You know what she told me?

155
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.590
And she told me and she told me, and she told me.

156
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.370
And she lined out an entire litany of

157
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.170
crisis, of hurt, of anger, of,

158
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.050
of just disloyalty.

159
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:05.410
And I was just taken back by this girl who

160
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.730
smiles and everything is great. And about that,

161
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.690
deep underneath all that kindness and gentleness was just the biggest

162
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.600
hurt in the world. Now

163
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.870
that describes all of us at one point or another,

164
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.590
and maybe just right now in your life,

165
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:31.550
and this is important for us to understand what David has to say.

166
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.110
Dr. Thomas, a few weeks ago, he said this in a sermon. He said,

167
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.270
you have a God who sees you, who knows you, who loves you,

168
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.680
sees you, knows you and loves you. And that's important for us to understand.

169
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.520
And that's what David wants us to see.

170
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.840
And so he describes in graphic detail about being distracted by a noisy

171
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.920
world. Then he says, I want you to be attentive to the word of God.

172
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.640
And this is where we kind of get some good news in all of these issues. See,

173
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.320
we have someone who hates us. Satan hates us. He wants to destroy us.

174
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.640
He wants to hurt us. He wants to damage us as best he can. But God loves us.

175
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.880
He knows all about us. He cares about us, and he loves us. So we're gonna be,

176
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.040
he wants this to be attentive to the word of God.

177
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.340
And so I wanna read verses 16 through 23 and

178
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.900
see what David has to say. Now he's,

179
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.500
he had this whole lineup of bad things up to verse 15.

180
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.393
And then he says,

181
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.610
but I called to God and the Lord will save me evening

182
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.570
and morning. And at noon I utter my complaint and I moan.

183
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.130
And he hears my voice.

184
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:44.170
He redeems my soul and safety for the battle that I wage for.

185
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.610
Many are arrayed against me. God will give ear and humble them.

186
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:54.010
He who is thrown from old say law because they do not change and do not

187
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.130
fear God. My companion stretched out his hand against his friends.

188
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.890
He violated his covenant. His speech was smooth as butter.

189
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.850
Yet war was in his heart. His words were softer than oil,

190
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.210
yet they were drawn swords,

191
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.610
cast your burden on the Lord and he will sustain you.

192
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.130
He will never permit the righteous to be moved but you,

193
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.690
God will cast them down into the pit of destruction.

194
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.890
Men of blood and Tre shall not live half their days.

195
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:28.870
But I will trust you. Now, folks,

196
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.350
this this is the good news.

197
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.630
This is where we come and just look before God and say, God, you're there.

198
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:39.150
You're, you're God. I call the God. He says, and I'll, the Lord will say me.

199
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.510
He hears my voice. There is where we need to be.

200
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.590
Now here's the problem.

201
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.910
We perceive certain things that are real,

202
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.110
but we perceive them in certain ways that they're concrete.

203
00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.170
When God all along has completely different truths for us to understand and

204
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.450
to know. And this is real important,

205
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:06.930
there's a story of Elisha Elisha in, in second King, six.

206
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:12.170
Elisha was a prophet of God. He was very well known, he's very powerful.

207
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.810
And he was protecting his king from being attacked by the king of Syria.

208
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.050
And the king of Syria found out about it and said, I'm gonna kill Elisha.

209
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.490
So the king of Syria puts together an army and he comes to

210
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.770
where Elisha lives. And there his army is a raid,

211
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.690
ready to do battle for one reason, to assassinate Elisha. Well,

212
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.170
elisha's servant got up in the morning to do whats whatever servants do in the

213
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.650
morning. And when he did, he saw the army of the, of the king of Syria.

214
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:46.410
And it was massive. And the the observant came back in and yelled, Eli Elisha,

215
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.010
Elisha, an entire army is here to assassinate you.

216
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:54.360
He Elisha looked at the servant and says, listen,

217
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.590
there are more who are for us than those

218
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.540
who are for them. And then the king or the Elisha said, Lord,

219
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.060
if you would please open my servant's eyes.

220
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.400
And the servant looked and it says that the mountains were arrayed

221
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.720
with the horses and chariots of fire of God

222
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.760
to overwhelm the king of Syria. Now,

223
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.240
that's the one thing the servant saw what was real,

224
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.350
but it really wasn't real because God is God and he had an entire

225
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.870
army to protect Elisha.

226
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.790
We need to learn when those things and those times come when we can trust God

227
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:43.110
and know what he is and who he is. But you see, God is Lord,

228
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.290
he's master, he's creator. He's the God most high.

229
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.050
He's a shepherd. He's a provider. He's the rock.

230
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:57.170
Our refuge, he's a healer, a banner under which we serve.

231
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.210
He's faithful. He's just, he's glorious, he's holy, he's loving,

232
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.370
he's wise, he's merciful, he's gracious.

233
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.690
God is enormous.

234
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:14.490
God is powerful. God knows all things,

235
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.090
sees all things he loves in a perfect manner. Every one of us,

236
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:25.530
you see our problems and fears become smaller as

237
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:30.330
our understanding and our knowledge and our experiences of God get

238
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.220
bigger. When we grow in our faith with God,

239
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.500
our problems just begin to dwindle away if we trust God.

240
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.820
Now, David's musical, his his,

241
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.220
this song went on to say in verse 22,

242
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:50.740
cast your burden on the Lord and he will sustain

243
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.060
you. Now,

244
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.180
I want to kind of explain this because it is so fabulous of a phrase.

245
00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.460
This psalmist is hard. And then you get down to verse 22.

246
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.140
And this verse is worth gold. You know what the word cast, it says,

247
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.620
cast your burden to God. Now,

248
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.100
when I started looking at that and realized what the definition of that was,

249
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.900
the only thing, the way, only way I could describe it was as a teenager,

250
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.580
when I had to go out and help my uncle in the, in the,

251
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.060
in the fields and to feed cattle, he would make me load the truck.

252
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.140
And so I would have to go get these 50 pound bags of,

253
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.460
of cattle cake of of feed and I would put 'em on my shoulder and I would carry

254
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.453
'em to the truck.

255
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.100
And then I would roll them off my shoulder into the truck.

256
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.260
You know what that rolling, that rolling that load off is,

257
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.460
it's the word to cast,

258
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.640
to cast my burden is to roll something off

259
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.320
into the hands of God. Now when you hear the word sustain,

260
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.000
when you roll it off into the hands of God,

261
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:58.480
God holds that problem in his hands.

262
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.080
That's the word. Sustain.

263
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.590
I cast off my burden and God then

264
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.600
carries it in his hands.

265
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:12.260
Now,

266
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.060
there is no more beautiful picture of what we can do with God and say to him,

267
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.620
Lord, here is my problem.

268
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.420
Here are my issues and I give them to you.

269
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.950
Well, this is where we grow in our faith.

270
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:31.750
When we start casting off our problems that beset us and weigh us down

271
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:36.110
and keep us from serving him. And we trust him to take care of those issues.

272
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.963
He loves us.

273
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.190
He wants to carry our burden as he carried the cross.

274
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.770
Now, I want to, I just wanna share as a, as a hospice chaplain,

275
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.640
I have people that I see and some of them you really are really neat

276
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.800
in how they live.

277
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.880
I have a gentleman that I see who is without a doubt the most brilliant

278
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:05.080
man I've ever met. The man has a PhD in music. He is,

279
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.680
he is just the sweetest spirited man. He, he,

280
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:15.080
uh, was a professor. He was a master musician,

281
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.640
a concert pianist. He practiced twice a day.

282
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.050
He has a disease and he's under hospice care.

283
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:29.870
And now he spends his day laying in bed and he's,

284
00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.870
he's really funny to see him cuz he just sits ram rods straight in bed asleep.

285
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.470
And the way he'll sit there, and when I go by to see him,

286
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.310
I'll wake him up and we visit. He eats a great effort.

287
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:47.190
He speaks with great effort. In fact, when he speaks,

288
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:51.110
I have to take a chair up and I'll set a chair right beside his bed and lean

289
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.910
over close to him so I can hear what he says. Now,

290
00:19:55.570 --> 00:20:00.390
our world defines us many times by what we look

291
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:05.270
like or what's happening to us or by our, our handicaps or our our issues.

292
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.550
And you would look at this man and say, well,

293
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.070
he is defined by the fact that he can't do any of these things any longer.

294
00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.630
And so that's what he is.

295
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:18.110
And I want you to understand that this gentleman has never

296
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.510
ever said anything about his disease in his limitations in his life.

297
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.630
When I come to visit him, I pull the chair up beside him and we talk about God.

298
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.710
He quotes psalms to me.

299
00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:38.190
We talk about music and what is the greatest classical works of God

300
00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:43.150
in music. We talk about the Bible, we talk about our lives.

301
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.430
He talks about his family. He wants to know about my family.

302
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:51.120
He knows every one of them. Now, he is not defined by his disease.

303
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.440
He's defined by his love of God.

304
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.360
He has never once spoken about his limitations,

305
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.800
only what God is doing in his life.

306
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.240
And he is the greatest blessing that I have during the week when I visit

307
00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:10.280
my patients because he loves God and he's not limited

308
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.160
and he doesn't say that he, he has problems. He knows that he,

309
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.710
that God is foreign. You know,

310
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.150
this is where we come to a place to understand that

311
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.400
God loves us and every one of us have problems.

312
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.920
Everyone of us have difficulties and God wants us to bring those to him.

313
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.440
And sometimes we get this perception about ourselves and

314
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.520
what we can or can't do.

315
00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.320
We get a perception of what's going on and we get worried about things.

316
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.440
It says in Psalm 46, God is our refuge and strength.

317
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.520
He's a very present help in trouble.

318
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.400
Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way though the mountains be

319
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.720
moved into the heart of the sea, though it's waters roar and foam,

320
00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.080
though the mountains tremble at its swelling.

321
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.640
God is there and he loves us.

322
00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.640
We just need to kind of get out of our own way. At times,

323
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.270
when I was a little boy,

324
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.310
I went to the Clay county fair with my uncle,

325
00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.950
the one that made me the slave of feeding the, feeding the pickup.

326
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:24.190
I went as a little boy to the, to the county fair in Clay County, Henrietta,

327
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.430
Texas. And I was there,

328
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.550
a little boy and I was with my uncle and I got lost.

329
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.590
My uncle left me and he left me as a little boy.

330
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.830
And I was standing there looking around and my uncle had left.

331
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.710
And all I knew what to do was to run. And so I ran, began to cry,

332
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.670
began to call his name. And I ran and I ran and I ran.

333
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:52.590
I ran around this massive building several times trying to find my uncle.

334
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.870
And I ran and I was scared and I was alone. And he had left me.

335
00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:56.990
And it was pathetic

336
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:03.300
when all of a sudden this big old hand reached out and grabbed me by the

337
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.460
collar and stopped me and pulled me right there.

338
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.740
Now that was my perception that the whole world was trying to hurt me and that

339
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.140
my uncle had left me and that I was alone. That was my perception.

340
00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.260
You know what the reality was? Well, here's the reality.

341
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.140
My uncle was standing beside me when I got lost.

342
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.420
He never moved. He never went anywhere.

343
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.740
He was standing there watching me run around this little bitty barn. And it was,

344
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.100
the wall was only that tall.

345
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.180
He could see me all the way around that barn as I ran.

346
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:41.460
And I didn't run five or six or seven times, I ran twice around a little barn.

347
00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.190
And when I ran by, finally the second time,

348
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.680
he reached his hand out and grabbed me and he says, stop.

349
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.140
And then he said this. He said, now listen, learn this lesson.

350
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.380
I've never forgotten it. I've passed it on to my kids and grandkids.

351
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.920
If you ever get lost, if you ever get lost,

352
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.640
stand still.

353
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:07.360
Because someone who loves you is gonna come looking

354
00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.120
for you. And if you're running around,

355
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.160
they won't be able to catch you won't be able to find you stand still.

356
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.800
Someone who loves you is gonna come find you.

357
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:24.580
When we're in trouble, when we're really bothered,

358
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.870
we need to stand still and trust God cuz he loves us.

359
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:36.010
He wants to be there for us. He wants to just help us.

360
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.360
Now here's what we do. This is our response. You know, David said, I wanna run,

361
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.280
I wanna flee, I wanna hide. I just wanna be somewhere else.

362
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.270
Well, we can't do that. David couldn't do that.

363
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.070
And that wasn't the point he was trying to make. He said,

364
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:58.430
cast your cares on the the Lord and he will carry you. So what we do,

365
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.830
well, you take that word, I will tru those words. I will trust you and then you.

366
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:07.750
So what you do is you tell God. You tell God, here's my concern.

367
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.870
Here is what's distracting me. This is what? What is bothering me.

368
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:12.790
So you tell God,

369
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:18.190
then you ask God to take you in his hand to sustain

370
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.083
you.

371
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:24.470
And then you honor God by expressing your faith to the

372
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.020
Lord and you trust him.

373
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.740
All of us have stress,

374
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.420
all of us have issues.

375
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.810
And David's whole musical of Psalm 55 is this,

376
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:47.770
God is infinitely interested in the

377
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:52.380
things that you face, the problems, the issues, your anger.

378
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.340
He knows all the emotions and he cares if you just

379
00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.900
simply cast your cares into his hand so that

380
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.420
he can carry them instead of you. That's his desire.

381
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.960
That's what he wants for you to do. Father,

382
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:14.150
we worship you. We.
