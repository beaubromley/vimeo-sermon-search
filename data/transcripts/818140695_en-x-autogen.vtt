00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.200
It truly is an honor to be a part

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.300
of what God has been doing here what he is doing here. And

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.900
what I believe he's going to do here. It is a sweet

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.300
thing for us to have been apart for

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.900
the last five years and we're thankful for the time away that the

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.500
church does care for us in that as

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.400
we look forward to that. But we have more important things to focus on

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.100
today. So I want you to open your copy of

9
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.900
God's word and turn to the book of Acts with me Acts chapter

10
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.100
1

11
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.400
the book of Acts chapter 1

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.900
As you turn there, I want to start by telling you of one of my earliest memories

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.600
in my life.

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.000
It is my first day of preschool at

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.900
The Learning Tree in Enid, Oklahoma.

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100
It was just etched into my mind. Like I can still

17
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.800
feel it. It was just me and my mom.

18
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.200
I'm sure she tried to to prep me

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.500
on how this was gonna go, but I guess it didn't work.

20
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.100
Because I remember I remember

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.400
going into the building and then walking down some stairs

22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.500
into a room that for some reason was really dark. I

23
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.600
think it was a dungeon, but that's just me.

24
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.400
There were a few other kids in the room and probably some other parents Milling about

25
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.200
and I'm sure the teacher came over and said something to me, but all

26
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.500
that's just kind of blurry because the picture that's

27
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.700
burned into my mind.

28
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.600
Is is the backlit silhouette

29
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.100
of my mom as she walks out of

30
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.400
the room?

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.500
Dark, I can see let's just that it's like I can I can

32
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.200
see it in my head right now. And then I just I just

33
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.900
lost it.

34
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.700
I could feel it right now almost to my soul.

35
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.400
And go to my counselor next week and talk about that one.

36
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.300
Here's the thing though as you and I

37
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.300
know.

38
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
What I experienced that morning is part of

39
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.600
what it means to grow up.

40
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.300
See I needed to learn that first. I could

41
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.100
trust my mom was going to come back at the end of

42
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.300
the day.

43
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.900
But also that I had what I needed to thrive

44
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.900
in that environment that I've been left in.

45
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.300
I didn't know it at the time but God had prepared me. My

46
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.700
mom had prepared me for that moment.

47
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.500
And I was ready.

48
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.900
I start with that story because today we're going to talk about the Ascension of

49
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.700
Jesus Christ.

50
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.400
Last week and we talked about Christ's death and Resurrection.

51
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.200
But then what happened next?

52
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.800
Like what happened after that?

53
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.000
again that important too

54
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.500
and why why did that all happen? We need to know these things.

55
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.200
See after Jesus had lived 33 years

56
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.600
of life that we couldn't live.

57
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.300
After he died the death that we deserved.

58
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.600
And after he came back from the grave to defeat sin

59
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.000
and death for us.

60
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.600
40 days later. He just left.

61
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.800
He ascended back to heaven.

62
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.600
And I'm sure that the friends he left behind.

63
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.900
Felt a little like I did that August morning and Enid.

64
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.100
Where I was wondering if my mom would come back and if everything was going to

65
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.700
be all right.

66
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.300
That's why what we study today is so critical.

67
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.500
See if we can truly understand what we're talking about today. I

68
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.000
believe our day-to-day lives will be transformed.

69
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.200
I believe everything will change for us and here's a simple truth.

70
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.900
I hope we walk away understanding today. I try to keep it a

71
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.500
little memorable in some ways. But here's the truth.

72
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.200
I hope you can grasp today that every Christian can

73
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.900
live a faithful Life by

74
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.300
trusting in Christ and in his ascended power.

75
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400
That's what I believe. That's what God's word shows us.

76
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.600
Is that every Christian?

77
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.200
can

78
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.600
Live a faithful Life by trusting in Christ and in

79
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.100
his ascended power.

80
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.200
My hope today.

81
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.200
Is that you gain some confidence from God's word?

82
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.300
that you see this that you you can

83
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.700
have confidence as you wait for his return Yes, but

84
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.200
also confidence as you live in

85
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200
a chaotic world like we live in

86
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.100
that's what I hope you see today and we'll

87
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.100
see it in Acts chapter 1 first thing we need to do here is we need

88
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.800
to get the facts of his Ascension.

89
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.200
Like what even happened? How does this even work? What are the

90
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.000
facts the basic facts of his Ascension?

91
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.300
Look at verses 1 through 3 of chapter one to start

92
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.400
with.

93
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.300
In the first book oath Theophilus. I've dealt with all that Jesus

94
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.200
began to do and teach.

95
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.200
Until the day when he was taken up after he had given

96
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.100
commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had

97
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.300
chosen.

98
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.200
He presented himself alive to them after his

99
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.100
suffering his cross by many proofs appearing

100
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.600
to them during 40 days and speaking about

101
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.900
the kingdom of God.

102
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.300
So this is the Doctor Luke who's researching The Life of

103
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.400
Christ and and his research indicated what Jesus did

104
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.500
during those 33 years of life. Yes, but

105
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.300
but Luke then also reiterated what we see later

106
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.500
in First Corinthians 15 where it says that in those

107
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.800
40 days post-resurrection over 500

108
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.700
people saw Jesus.

109
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.400
Like they talked to him. They ate meals with him that he was not just

110
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.600
a figment of people's imagination.

111
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.200
He was there.

112
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.000
He was risen.

113
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.300
And so he was teaching his disciples about the kingdom through those

114
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.500
40 days. The problem was at the disciples as they heard

115
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.600
Jesus talk about this kingdom of God. They

116
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.900
still did not have a full understanding of what he meant

117
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.500
by it. What was about to happen?

118
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.000
Like they assumed this moment as he's risen from the

119
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.700
grave this moment was when Jesus would take over now if he

120
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.200
is the Messiah he's going to take over they even asked that

121
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.100
in verse 6. Look at this.

122
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.400
When they'd come together, they asked him asked

123
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.700
Jesus Lord, will you at this time restore the

124
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.000
kingdom to Israel?

125
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.600
In other words Jesus is this going

126
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.700
to be the time that you bring the theocracy back?

127
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.200
Like you make it the way it used to be back in the old like we

128
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.500
read about with with Dave is this is this gonna be again when

129
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.000
you do that?

130
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.000
Now they weren't necessarily wrong.

131
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.900
They just had a very limited and Earthly focus on God's

132
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.500
actions at this time.

133
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.100
And so Jesus says to them know that's not what I came for at

134
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.000
this point in history. Look at verses 7 and 8.

135
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.400
He said to them it's not for you to know times or Seasons that

136
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.400
the father has fixed by his own authority.

137
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.200
But you will receive power when the Holy

138
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.600
Spirit has come upon you and you will be my Witnesses in

139
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.300
Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and to

140
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.500
the end of the Earth.

141
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.600
So the disciples came to Jesus looking for a calendar and he

142
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.500
gave them a commission.

143
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.600
Now we talk about that Acts 1:8 commission a

144
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.400
lot right that mission

145
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.400
is is at the very core of this whole thing. We

146
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.100
call Christianity. It's not just Christians and then

147
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.700
we have a mission like Christianity is a mission.

148
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.500
That's why we say around here. We say live sin. We

149
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.300
say you are sent we say it all the time around here

150
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.300
because we find later in the New Testament. We

151
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.600
are his ambassadors. We are ministers of reconciliation that

152
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.900
he's given us this charge to go.

153
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.200
But as soon as he gave those final words

154
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.900
in verse 8, look at what happened in verse 9

155
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.300
and when he had said these things as they were looking on

156
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.300
he was lifted up in a cloud took

157
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.200
him out of their sight.

158
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.600
Just think about how stunning that

159
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.300
would have been right?

160
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.300
You might have joined in with the disciples look at

161
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.500
verse 10 and while they were gazing into heaven

162
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.400
as he went, right? They're just they're just standing

163
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.100
there gawking like you remember the cartoons where

164
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.500
the mouth just drops to the floor. Like, that's the Imagine scene.

165
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.600
I have of this that they're just staring up in heaven.

166
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800
Like what just happened?

167
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.200
I think we need to give him a break though, right?

168
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.800
Like this dude, just sitting there talking to them and then he just starts floating

169
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.100
and he goes up to heaven. They can't see anymore like

170
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.300
that would be stunning.

171
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.600
You wouldn't really know what to do in response. So natural.

172
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.500
They're just staring up into heaven. They don't know what to do with this.

173
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.700
till verse 10 continues behold

174
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.300
two men stood by them in white robes to

175
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.600
angels and said men of Galilee. Why do you stand looking

176
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.200
into heaven?

177
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.200
I got your answer Angels. Did you not just see what

178
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:18.800
happened here?

179
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.500
Why do you stand looking into heaven notice why they say it this Jesus

180
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.800
who was taken up from you into heaven will come

181
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.200
in the same way as you saw him go into

182
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.900
heaven.

183
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.500
So the apostles are staring there like a like

184
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.600
a kid at a zoo seeing a giraffe for the first time just

185
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.700
staring up into heaven.

186
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.600
But then these angels show up and say hey guys. Listen, this

187
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.100
is not the end.

188
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.400
What you just watched happen will happen someday in

189
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.100
Reverse when he comes back.

190
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.400
Meaning he is returning one day and what's he

191
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.400
coming back to do we know from the rest of scripture. He's coming back to put an end

192
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.500
to evil and to suffering and to fully and

193
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.200
finally bring about his kingdom here on Earth. That's what he's

194
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.900
coming back to do.

195
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.600
That's good news.

196
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.000
Now we think about this scene though.

197
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.200
The reality is that Jesus hypothetically could

198
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.500
have stayed and inaugurated his

199
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.100
kingdom then right?

200
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.300
He could have taken over like they asked him to take over, but

201
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.700
he didn't.

202
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.500
He left and and so so there must

203
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.600
be a purpose to him leaving and us staying

204
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:35.700
here.

205
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.300
Even like when we get converted when we repent and

206
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.300
believe and God changes our lives, he doesn't just poof us to heaven. So there's a

207
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.500
reason we are still here a reason those apostles were left there.

208
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.400
Well, that's next. We saw the facts of the rest of

209
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.400
the Ascension now, we need to understand the implications of

210
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.600
his Ascension.

211
00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.700
Why did he do it?

212
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.000
Why did this happen the way it did the implications

213
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.400
here?

214
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.100
Follow up to that is what did Jesus ascend back to heaven to do?

215
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.500
Why did he leave? Yes any implications of that for us? But but

216
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.500
what's he even doing in heaven right now?

217
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.400
Let's see send it back to heaven. So what's he doing? Is he chilling

218
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.400
on a cloud like like hanging out with Moses playing golf

219
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.300
on perfect Fairways like singing in the quiet. We don't

220
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.600
what is Jesus doing right now?

221
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.000
Listen, I hope.

222
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.300
I hope you get some encouragement here from this one Church like

223
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.200
this this right here. What is Jesus doing right

224
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.000
now man this

225
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.300
This I hope fills us up because first

226
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.900
scripture says when he went to heaven.

227
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.200
He sat down at the right hand of God.

228
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.100
Now why is that even important?

229
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.800
Why does it matter where he's sitting?

230
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.000
Because the right hand of the king.

231
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.200
Signifies honor signifies Authority

232
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.800
is signifies power.

233
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.900
Jesus even predicted this about himself Luke 22 69.

234
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.500
He's he's talking to the counsel. He's

235
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.300
in a trial moment in this and and he said

236
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.800
to them from now on you will see the son of man that's

237
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.400
his character designation of himself. It's the

238
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.700
son of man shall be seated at the right hand of the power

239
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.700
of God.

240
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.500
See that there's there's power in that

241
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.500
position. He has it's also in the Great Commission Matthew

242
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.000
28:18. Jesus said after his resurrection, all

243
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.500
authority in heaven on

244
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.300
Earth has been given to me.

245
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.600
He's got power. He's got Authority even further Paul

246
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.500
picks this up in Ephesians chapter 1 verses 20 through

247
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.300
23 that he worked in Christ when he

248
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.200
raised him from the dead seated him at his right hand

249
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.300
in the Heavenly places far above all Rule and

250
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.500
authority and power and Dominion above every name

251
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.000
that his name not only in this age, but also in the

252
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.400
one to come he put all things under his feet gave him

253
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.200
his head over all things to the church, which is his body

254
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.400
the fullness of him who fills all in all

255
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.700
I say all of that simply to say this that Jesus is the

256
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.000
king.

257
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.400
Like this this is who he is. I know

258
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.000
I know it's hard to understand how his sovereignty works out day

259
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.300
to day and you're thinking well, he's the king how come this bad

260
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.800
stuff? I know that's hard.

261
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.300
But the other worldly Kingdom has a

262
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.700
king.

263
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.200
Remember last week. Jesus says my kingdom is not of this world.

264
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.100
This other worldly Kingdom has a king. His name is Jesus

265
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.100
who is good who does good and there are no

266
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.500
competitors to his throne.

267
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.600
So what does Jesus doing right now? He's reigning as the king

268
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.400
that alone should give us confidence today,

269
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.600
right?

270
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.600
But he's not only ruling Over All.

271
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.400
Eventually bringing his kingdom in full one day.

272
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.200
He's ruling but first Timothy 2:5 says Jesus is also mediating

273
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.700
between us and the father.

274
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.900
What's Jesus doing right now? He's ruling he's mediating.

275
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.500
What's a mediator?

276
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.500
A mediator is a go-between.

277
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.800
A person who attempts to make unreconciled people

278
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.400
come to a peaceful agreement together.

279
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.800
That's what a mediator's goal is and that is

280
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.300
what Jesus is doing for you and for me right now

281
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:33.800
Christian.

282
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.300
Like he's an attorney who is defending us

283
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.500
against the enemy's accusations.

284
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.400
Tossing all these things against us and he's he's

285
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.400
defending us but he's also the one

286
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.000
who paid the penalty the judge is demanding.

287
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.200
So the judge said here's what has to happen. You're guilty. Yes.

288
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.400
But he stepped in between and said no. I'm going to take the penalty

289
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:01.700
instead.

290
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.800
He's mediating and that's just constantly happening.

291
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.400
He's given himself for our penalty.

292
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.300
So if we have Jesus mediating for

293
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.500
us, that's how we can draw near in confidence.

294
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.500
We can draw near to God in full Assurance knowing

295
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.100
that our sins are covered.

296
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.600
That we are forgiven.

297
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:30.700
Christian

298
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200
please hear that today.

299
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.500
Stop judging yourself for what Jesus has already

300
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.800
paid for cleansed and washed away.

301
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.900
You are forgiven.

302
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.400
You have a mediator you have one who paid

303
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.700
the price continually claims it

304
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.800
for you in the courtroom of Eternity. He is

305
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.300
in your place.

306
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.900
You are forgiven.

307
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.300
I know you you might regret there might be some consequences from what you've

308
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.100
done but you're not a second-class citizen in the

309
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.700
Kingdom of Heaven.

310
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.100
You're forgiven.

311
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.400
Don't walk back into it, but you're forgiven live in that

312
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.900
today.

313
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.400
So he's ruling he's mediating. There's

314
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.600
even more he's doing right now.

315
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.800
John 14

316
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.200
one through three says this

317
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.300
Jesus let not your hearts be troubled.

318
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.200
believe in God believe also in me

319
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.700
in my father's house are many rooms if

320
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.800
it were not so what I have told you that I go to

321
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.400
prepare a place for you.

322
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.700
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and we'll

323
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.400
take you to myself that where I

324
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.200
am. You may be also.

325
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.000
So like many of us sang growing up.

326
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.300
G one thing Jesus is doing right now is he's preparing

327
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.900
a big big house.

328
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.100
With lots and lots of rooms.

329
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.700
It's got a big table in it.

330
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.600
Got a big yard, you can play football. For

331
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:22.800
example.

332
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.400
That's what he's doing right now. Who's he

333
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.200
building the house for he's building a house for his children.

334
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.000
For those who trusted in him?

335
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.900
And I know life is hard.

336
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.600
It's hard for all of us in various ways. But

337
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.300
the good news here is that he's prepared. He's gone

338
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.100
to prepare a place. So we're kind of sad about that. But also

339
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.500
the king is coming back for his children.

340
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.300
If I go to prepare a place I'm going to come back for you. That's what he says.

341
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.800
So he's preparing this future home for us right

342
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.100
now.

343
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.800
There are more things I could mention that Jesus doing right now. He's he's fighting

344
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.800
the spiritual battle behind the scenes.

345
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.600
He's praying for us every moment. Like

346
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.500
these are things that we must remember Jesus doing for

347
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.200
us. But I hope you can see even just this small glimpse. Why?

348
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.600
Every Christian can live a faithful Life As

349
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.700
We Trust in Christ and in his ascended power.

350
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.200
In what he's doing for us right now. That's how we can

351
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.100
walk in confidence. That's how we can stand strong when we

352
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.600
look at this. If you are his you can stand strong

353
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.200
knowing he reigns over all that. He has forgiven

354
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.200
you and that one day he's coming back to

355
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.500
get you.

356
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.500
That's today. You can stand strong today

357
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.600
no matter what you face.

358
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.600
So that's what he's doing, but there's a flip side to this.

359
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.900
That he left to go do some things. Yes.

360
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.700
But it's also true that he then left us

361
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.700
here to do something as well.

362
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.400
Not to just merely survive, but to to do

363
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.400
something as well. We saw what Jesus doing, but what are we supposed

364
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.500
to do since he left?

365
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.500
He didn't take us with him.

366
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.000
So what are we supposed to do until he comes back to get us?

367
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.000
Well, first of all, it's

368
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.100
to repent and believe

369
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.200
right that

370
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.000
that's the core of this he wants us to

371
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.600
turn from our sin and our self and turn to Jesus life death

372
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.100
and Resurrection in our place. That's the core of

373
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.600
all of this.

374
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.400
What do we do until he comes back? We are called to repent

375
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.100
and believe.

376
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.400
It all starts there.

377
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.400
But then think about how the early church responded to this

378
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.800
moment in Acts.

379
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.600
Jesus ascended to Heaven. How did

380
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.600
the early church respond to

381
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.000
him? How did how did their lives change in

382
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.100
response now that they knew he was

383
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.200
resurrected and they knew he was ascended in all

384
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.400
authority that he had in that. What did they do?

385
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.500
Well, they became these acts 18

386
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.100
Witnesses.

387
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.700
That's the entire rest of the book of Acts is them living out?

388
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.500
What Jesus just said to do his last words were their

389
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.600
first priority? That's what they began to do.

390
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.200
Remember, what a witness is.

391
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.700
a witness

392
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.800
Is simply saying what they know what

393
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.500
they've seen?

394
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.500
There's no debate. There's no angle. There's there's

395
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.600
no one that can argue against your

396
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.200
your story your your witness your

397
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.700
testimony, right? It's your story.

398
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.600
Just think about the blind man. Jesus healed

399
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.400
in John chapter 9.

400
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.000
If you don't know the story that the scene is that the Pharisees heard

401
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.200
about Jesus healing this man. They bring the man

402
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.200
before the council they begin to question him. They're trying

403
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.100
to catch him in a lie. They even bring his parents in to say

404
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.300
is he really blind from birth or was that just a store? Like they're trying

405
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.800
to figure out how they can trap this guy and eventually trapped

406
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.200
Jesus as a result, but here's the thing.

407
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.200
They could not deny the fact that this man

408
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:28.500
was healed.

409
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.400
In fact, this is one of my favorite passages in scripture

410
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.600
in John 9:25. The man says this

411
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.400
like they're debating trying to get him to say something wrong

412
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.000
and in chapter 9 verse 25, they're talking

413
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.000
about Jesus negatively. And this is what he says.

414
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.200
Whether he is a sinner, I don't know one thing. I do know

415
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.700
that though. I was blind now I can see.

416
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.500
I you guys can think whatever you think about this guy. If

417
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.500
you think he's a profit you think he's a sinner whatever it is all I

418
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.000
know I've been blind my whole life and now I can see.

419
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.400
That's green. That's blue. I can tell that's like

420
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.200
you you see I can see now I couldn't see

421
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.700
before so he did something.

422
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.400
That's the point of a testimony, right?

423
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.800
You talk about how your life has changed and no one can deny

424
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.800
the fact that you were this and now you're this.

425
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.000
That's your story. No one can debate that.

426
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.400
But listen we get so excited about all kinds

427
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.500
of things. We get really excited about like like how

428
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.300
we lost weight or or what our favorite side hustle

429
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.600
is that we're making money this way or or how

430
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.200
our favorite team is playing or not. They're playing very well at

431
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.100
all like you we get super excited. We talk about all those things.

432
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.500
Why do we not get more excited about what God

433
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.100
has done in our lives?

434
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.300
We talk about this we post about this. We say all

435
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.600
these things. Why do we not get more excited? Like how could we not want to

436
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.600
tell people that Jesus has saved Our Lives

437
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.100
eternally.

438
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.300
That we have been saved that we actually oh

439
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.800
God.

440
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.100
We actually know God because not because we

441
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.700
made our way to him, but because he came to us in grace

442
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.400
and mercy and so we know God as a result of him

443
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.100
initiating this whole thing.

444
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.500
How can we not get excited about that see when we're truly

445
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.500
awakened to that reality?

446
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.100
Living like that and talking like that doesn't feel like

447
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.300
an obligation anymore.

448
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.600
It's done out of love.

449
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.700
It's done out of reverence. It's done out of all.

450
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.200
for how great our God is

451
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.000
I know you I've grown up in my whole life in church

452
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.300
and you've heard it over and over again. We need to go share the gospel. We need to go love people.

453
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.000
We need to these things and it kind of feels obligation.

454
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.300
I guess I got to remember to do that this week sometime right down

455
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:02.900
to store like no.

456
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:04.900
listen, if

457
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.200
if you are awake to the reality of

458
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.100
Jesus dying in your place.

459
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.100
Of him loving you enough that you were an enemy made you

460
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.900
a family like if you've been awakened to that the gratitude that

461
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.100
just compels us to talk about it.

462
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.200
Changed our lives. We must speak. It's

463
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.300
like it's like when the council commanded Peter

464
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:29.900
and John.

465
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.500
to not speak about Jesus in Acts 4:20

466
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.800
They brought him in and they said hey, you guys need to stop talking

467
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.600
about this Jesus.

468
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:41.700
their response

469
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.500
we cannot help but speak of

470
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.600
what we've seen and heard.

471
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.000
we have to

472
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.700
You can kill us we have to talk about this.

473
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.100
Because he is God who came to us

474
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.600
as our savior?

475
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.600
Just be awaken to that reality Church.

476
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.700
Now I know I get it.

477
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.500
When we start to consider this Acts 1:8 commission that

478
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.100
Jesus says to be witnesses to All Nations. It's

479
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.700
daunting.

480
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.200
Start to think how How would how do I need to respond to

481
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.000
that? I mean, I'm

482
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.600
All Nations, I can't even travel I can't I

483
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.000
don't go very far. How can I be a witness to the

484
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.400
nation? Am I disobedient to God or or you begin to think about how unqualified you

485
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.200
are or how unprepared you

486
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.300
are for this or you're afraid of what people gonna think about you if

487
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.600
you start really living this thing out and and so you see all

488
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.200
of that makes it really daunting.

489
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.500
To do what God's left us here to do.

490
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.300
Which is why we must understand how?

491
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.700
We are to go about this task.

492
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200
Seeing what Jesus is doing.

493
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:57.600
What we are to do.

494
00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.200
How do we do it?

495
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.900
How do we go about this task?

496
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.400
Well, you might have noticed that I skipped in Acts

497
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.300
1 verses 4 and 5 the first time.

498
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.300
Acts 1 verses 4 and 5 look at that now.

499
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.500
While staying with them he ordered them not to

500
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.800
depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise

501
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.400
of the father.

502
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.600
Which he said you heard from me for John baptized with

503
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.100
water, but you will be baptized with the

504
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.500
Holy Spirit not many days from now.

505
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.700
And then in verse 8 I read early but he ties the mission

506
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.200
with the Holy Spirit look at this, but you

507
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.400
will receive power.

508
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.300
When the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will

509
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.600
be my Witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea Samaria

510
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.400
and to the end of the Earth.

511
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.900
So I know you look at this commission Global and

512
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:02.400
and

513
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.100
challenging and you're gonna have stick stick your neck

514
00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.000
out a little bit all that you look at that and it is overwhelming. And yes.

515
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.200
Hear me say this every single one of us is

516
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.300
inadequate for that task.

517
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.700
That's where we all are.

518
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.400
But here's one final major implication of

519
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.900
Christ's Ascension.

520
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.100
It's that the Holy Spirit comes into every believer.

521
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.900
Now this is not the first time the Holy Spirit shows up in the Bible.

522
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.800
Holy spirit's been present and active from before creation all

523
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.000
the way through the Old Testament. He was just selective

524
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.300
as he came and went on people for

525
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.800
certain tasks and purposes.

526
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.700
the difference now

527
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.600
is that all believers have the Holy

528
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.300
Spirit indwelling them?

529
00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.900
and it happens first here in Acts chapter 2

530
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.800
the Holy Spirit comes on the first Christian. Jesus said wait till he's

531
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.200
gonna come in a couple days. Well a couple days later.

532
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.200
It's called Pentecost and you're gonna see that in a few weeks and Acts chapter

533
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.400
2. We'll get there at the end of May.

534
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.400
But he comes on them to empower them

535
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.200
to obey Christ's commands here this one

536
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.500
but all of the other ones.

537
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.700
We see in Acts 2. They received the Holy Spirit, they're filled

538
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.300
and they're obedient, but it's the same thing. It's

539
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.600
also what happens for every Christian at conversion.

540
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.800
Where the Holy Spirit fills you to empower you

541
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.100
to fulfill Christ's call also.

542
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.600
It's not just an acts two thing. This is for you and

543
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.600
me as well.

544
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.300
Yet if we're being honest.

545
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.600
If we had a choice.

546
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.700
Most of us would prefer Jesus to

547
00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.500
still be here.

548
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.500
Where Jesus be walking around talking to people like we

549
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.200
could invite him to be the guest preacher over the next few weeks. That'd be

550
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:07.400
pretty cool.

551
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.900
but listen to what Jesus says

552
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.300
John 16 verse 7. He says it is

553
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.300
to your advantage that I go away.

554
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.200
For if I do not go away the helper.

555
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.200
Critical word the helper will not come to you.

556
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.600
But if I go.

557
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.400
I will send him to you.

558
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.500
You see what that means.

559
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.600
The condition on the Holy Spirit coming into

560
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.400
the life of every believer was that Jesus

561
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.400
had to leave.

562
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.300
We want Jesus right here. No, he had to leave so that this

563
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.100
could happen and Jesus said that would actually be better for us.

564
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.400
How's that better?

565
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.900
Because then not only is God beside you you have

566
00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.400
God inside you.

567
00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.800
As Acts 1:8 says you will remember you

568
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.200
will receive power.

569
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.000
When the Holy Spirit has come upon you.

570
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.600
And the holy spirit's not different 2,000 years later. It's the

571
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.100
same Holy Spirit the same power that lives in you

572
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.800
believer.

573
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.200
And hear me when I say empowering here that simply means

574
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.200
God gives you the ability to do what he's called

575
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.000
you to do.

576
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.400
Which by the way when we say empowering for that, it means way

577
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.500
more than just preaching or moving overseas.

578
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.600
Empowering here means you're empowered

579
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.000
to serve it Camp to serve at VBS to

580
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.400
Mentor a young mom.

581
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.900
It's empowered to go on mission trips. It's empowered

582
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.300
to minister to your neighbors.

583
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.400
It's empowered to get plugged into a micro group with just a few other people

584
00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.000
here in this church. It's empowered to

585
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.000
pray diligently for the lost and for the ministry of

586
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.700
the church. That's what we're talking about here.

587
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.400
and way more

588
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.600
it's also God empowering you to overcome that temptation.

589
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.400
It's God empowering you to sacrificially love your spouse

590
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.400
when you want to be selfish.

591
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.300
it's got empowering you to step up and

592
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.400
lead out when there's a need at work and nobody else is

593
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.500
going to fill it, but you can

594
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.900
And it's God empowering our church.

595
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.400
To fill the call of God has on us to glorify him by

596
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.700
becoming this hub for an all ages disciple making movement where

597
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.500
we see lives transformed all over the place that that's God's

598
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.300
power through his holy spirit in us to do

599
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.300
those kinds of things.

600
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.500
So my mom walked out of that room that morning.

601
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.200
I could have run to the corner and curled up and

602
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.100
cried the whole time until she came back.

603
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.200
But the essence of our faith.

604
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.400
You take that into this context. The essence of our faith is

605
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.400
not just surviving until Jesus comes.

606
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:20.000
It's actually able to thrive in

607
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.900
the environment that he has left us in here.

608
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.500
That we're not just scared in the corner until he comes back. We're

609
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.700
actually able to thrive how because he's planted his

610
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.800
holy spirit inside you believer.

611
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.600
You don't have to live scared in the corner. You can thrive in

612
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.400
this. So yes, I know the mission is daunting. I

613
00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.600
know life is difficult life is painful. But

614
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.700
because Christ is ascended raining

615
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.300
ruling mediating all of those things. And because

616
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.600
he's planted his holy spirit inside of us. We can

617
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.100
have confidence to live a faithful life today and every

618
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.200
day

619
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.400
this is what enabled the church in Acts that

620
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.500
we look at and say wow amazing, right? This

621
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.300
is what enabled them to be. So mildly used

622
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:06.600
by God.

623
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.600
They're no different than we are.

624
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.700
The holy spirit's the same in them as it is in us.

625
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.700
They knew they lived as if

626
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.900
they knew that the only way they

627
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.300
could accomplish this mission is if God did it.

628
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.700
I already said earlier Peter and John boldly spoke before the council in

629
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.000
Acts chapter 4 but listen to The Believers prayer right

630
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.200
after that scene, they come back

631
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.400
and they're rejoicing they got persecuted. But listen to this acts 4:29

632
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.300
through 31. They pray now Lord

633
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.000
look upon their threats Grant to your

634
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.500
servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness.

635
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.300
While you stretch out your hand to heal

636
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.200
and signs and wonders are performed through the

637
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.800
name of your holy servant Jesus.

638
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.300
And when they'd prayed the place in which they were gathered together

639
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.400
was shaken and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and

640
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.900
continued to speak the word of God with boldness.

641
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.200
You see how they had that kind of confidence.

642
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.600
How can we have that kind of confidence today? They

643
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.200
had it we can have it because they believed and we

644
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.900
believe in a Creator God who is supremely Sovereign

645
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.100
and who Reigns over all things as the king of

646
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:24.500
kings.

647
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.300
That's that's confidence building for us. We have

648
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.700
the King on the throne. But also

649
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.800
here's another reason confidence is because our enemy

650
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.700
is like a snake with his head cut off right? He's

651
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.700
still thrashes around and he fights hard. But ultimately

652
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.000
he's already defeated.

653
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.500
The death and resurrection and soon coming return of

654
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.500
Jesus Christ has defeated the enemy.

655
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.500
And again if you're in his family.

656
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.600
Through repentance and belief you have that

657
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.000
as your confidence and you have everything you

658
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.800
need to do what he's called you to do.

659
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.000
your king

660
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.100
has resourced you.

661
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.100
with his spirits power

662
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.900
He's given you his word.

663
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.700
He's given you his body the church.

664
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.600
So you and I and every believer can

665
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.600
live a Godly life.

666
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.000
possible

667
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.900
and we can fulfill his Commission.

668
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.400
It's possible.

669
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:38.700
and remember the

670
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.300
maybe maybe one of the best parts of this is that we can do all of

671
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.900
that with confidence we can thrive in this environment today.

672
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.700
Because like my mom did at the end of that school day.

673
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.400
We know our Master is coming

674
00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.300
back to make it. All right again.

675
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.300
And so let's trust him today.

676
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.000
Let's live for him every day.

677
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.700
until that day

678
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.900
when it's all right again.

679
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.600
amen

680
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.100
Listen, I want you to remember something in this.

681
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.700
This only works.

682
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.100
this this only

683
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.900
works if we have been if you have been Justified

684
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.600
before God.

685
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.900
If you've been made right with God.

686
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:39.900
and thankfully

687
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.600
he has made the way for that to happen.

688
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.100
His broken body and shed Blood on the

689
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.800
cross is what makes the way.

690
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.300
for us

691
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.300
for Sinners Like Us.

692
00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.400
That's what we remember and celebrate with the Lord's Supper.

693
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.500
Celebrating all that God has done all that he is doing and

694
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.200
really technically all that he will do.

695
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.100
So I'm going to invite the worship leaders to come back out now.

696
00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.100
And if you're gonna serve the Lord's Supper elements, you can go ahead and come forward and

697
00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.900
begin to set those things up.

698
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.000
If you need gluten-free, it's always at the back so you can go slip out and grab that.

699
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.300
But as they come get prepared and everything gets starting set it

700
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.600
up. I know we can kind of transition our minds, but I want you and

701
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.700
I to get

702
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.300
Prepared as well.

703
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.300
They're gonna get set up all of that. But we must remember

704
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.500
a couple things as we do this.

705
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.600
First that this is a reminder.

706
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.000
That we could not save ourselves.

707
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.200
Right. This act is a reminder. We cannot save ourselves we

708
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.100
needed Jesus to do it for us. His broken body shed blood is

709
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.100
what does it but it's also reminder that he did it.

710
00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.500
we couldn't do it and he actually did it

711
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.300
his broken body and shed blood paid the price to cover our

712
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.300
sins forever and ever if we believe

713
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.200
That's why this is for believers who have declared that their faith

714
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.300
is in him publicly, but also believer remember he's

715
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.800
forgiven you.

716
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.300
He's forgiven you for all of this.

717
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.900
Walk in that rest in that today.

718
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.200
But this act is also a reminder.

719
00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.400
That our response to God's work is to

720
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.100
die to ourselves and to give him everything.

721
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:37.900
That's what he deserves.

722
00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.200
If this is who our King is, that's what he deserves all the time

723
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.700
every moment of every day. So mourn your

724
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.600
sin rejoice in his salvation and in that

725
00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.200
give your life more and more.

726
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.100
to him
