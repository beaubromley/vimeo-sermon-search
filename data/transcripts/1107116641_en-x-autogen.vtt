00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:04.125
Good morning.

2
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:08.045
My name's Bill Fudge, and this is my granddaughter Bridget.

3
00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:12.205
Uh, Bridget came to know the Lord when she was much younger,

4
00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:14.045
but didn't understand about baptism,

5
00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:18.925
but through a close friend's, uh, nearing death

6
00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:21.125
and then passing away in January,

7
00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:24.125
she started reading her Bible

8
00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:28.685
and came across a verse that spoke to her

9
00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.005
when she went to church.

10
00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:33.845
She heard the preacher preach on that verse.

11
00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:36.125
And then later that week, the same, uh,

12
00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.045
different friend spoke to her using that same verse, come

13
00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:41.405
to me and I will give you rest.

14
00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:45.405
And so she's been close drawing closer to the Lord,

15
00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:46.845
reading her scripture daily

16
00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:49.485
and realized that she needed to be baptized.

17
00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:53.805
And so today she comes to you to be baptized.

18
00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:55.845
Bridget, I have one question.

19
00:00:56.795 --> 00:00:59.925
Have you accepted the Lord as your Lord and Savior? Yes.

20
00:01:01.315 --> 00:01:03.805
Then it's my privilege, my granddaughter

21
00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:07.045
and sister in faith to baptize you in the name

22
00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:09.805
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

23
00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:16.445
Stand up.
