1
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.600
What?

2
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.100
Just trying to keep it classy around Christmas. That's what we do around here, you know.

3
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.300
No, seriously, one thing I want kids growing up

4
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.300
knowing if they've been a part of our church is that it's possible

5
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.800
to have fun while still taking your faith very seriously.

6
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.300
That they grow up knowing that this church that

7
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
they had a great time at preach the

8
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.600
gospel.

9
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.300
Saying praise to our King and disciple them

10
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.100
towards Jesus and still had fun while they were doing it.

11
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
And so that's what we're here doing today. That's what we

12
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.100
do every week. We gather together is towards that end specially

13
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.200
in the season of Advent as we look to how

14
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.800
Jesus fulfills the longings of our hearts.

15
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.500
Towards hope and peace and joy and

16
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.900
love.

17
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.600
today in part but one day

18
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.600
Fulfill those things one day in full

19
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.400
that's what Advent does it. It aligns

20
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.500
us with what happened 2,000 years

21
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.600
ago. And those who are waiting before Jesus was born in

22
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.500
that Tiny Town of Bethlehem. It aligns us

23
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.200
with what they were waiting for because we're still waiting for

24
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200
something and it stirs our hearts for what he will

25
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.200
bring one day when he comes back.

26
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.400
So today we're studying the fourth word of Advent which is love

27
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.800
And so take your copy of God's word and turn with me to first John

28
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.700
4 to see that first John

29
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.800
4 is where we will see that.

30
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.600
It's always almost to the end of the Bible. If you

31
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
hit the maps, you've gone too far. So come back a little bit through Revelation

32
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.300
first second. Third, John.

33
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.900
first John chapter 4

34
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.200
now we've had to do this every week because these words are so

35
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.200
broad. We have to define the word we're talking about so that

36
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.700
we can understand what we're even

37
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.500
talking about here because the reality is we throw this word

38
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.000
love around all the time. Like how

39
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.100
many of you love pizza?

40
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.100
Right you guys. Yeah, I'm there with you how many of you

41
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.300
love your mom? So now inherent in

42
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.800
that we know that we mean different things by that right unless maybe you

43
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.100
don't your mom's gonna feel really bad about that. So but

44
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.200
we know like there's there's differences the

45
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.600
way we use the word now thankfully in the original languages of

46
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.300
God's word. They actually had multiple words to say

47
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.200
those different things.

48
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.400
In the Old Testament Hebrew you had words for love referring to

49
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.400
the way a married couple would talk to each other and that kind

50
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.300
of love you had words that were the love we have for God the

51
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.500
Delight we have in him.

52
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.200
But there was one word that was most often used

53
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.300
for love. And that's the word that we've talked about over the

54
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.300
last few months here has said that that loyal

55
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.300
steadfast Covenant love

56
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.700
God has for his people.

57
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.100
Here's a good definition of it is that there is solid action

58
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.700
accompanying the feeling.

59
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.300
There is an affectionate feeling but there's action with it.

60
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.300
Well in the New Testament Greek you have many words as well

61
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.500
and some of you might have heard of the word phileo, which is more likely

62
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.100
there's basic relationship between people.

63
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.100
But like the Old Testament the New Testament had one

64
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.700
primary word for love and that's the word

65
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.100
that talks about God's love for us

66
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.800
our love for him.

67
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.400
Appropriate love for one another and

68
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.100
that's the Greek word gape.

69
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.500
Like has said was in the Old Testament Agape in

70
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.200
the New Testament.

71
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.700
It's used for how the Father and Son interact.

72
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.200
When the sun's baptized and the father says this is my beloved. That's

73
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.000
the root word Agape. It's how

74
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.600
we are supposed to respond to

75
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.400
God. It's what Jesus said his primary that we love God with

76
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.100
all that we are and we love our neighbor as ourselves, which is

77
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.600
what we'll talk about here in a second.

78
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.400
It's also what Paul said in First Corinthians

79
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.600
13 is the most important thing. It's this agape. Love

80
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.800
for one another.

81
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.500
In fact, it's so prevalent. Maybe the main theme

82
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.200
of the New Testament it is all over in

83
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.300
the the forms the various forms of

84
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.100
the word Agape in the New Testament 745 times.

85
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.900
That's how important this is to us.

86
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.300
Yet we still need a definition.

87
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.000
of love

88
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.400
what that has said and Agape were referring to how we're

89
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.100
going to use it today. What's the definition? Well, here's a

90
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.700
great one from one of my favorite authors named Paul Tripp. We

91
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.100
put it on your notes. You don't have to write it down. We'll put on

92
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.500
the screen as well. But here's how he defined love.

93
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.100
That it is willing self-sacrifice for

94
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.400
the good of another.

95
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.900
That does not require reciprocation or that

96
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.000
the person being loved is deserving.

97
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.900
They might try to write it down, but I'm gonna rephrase it. Maybe a little more simple here.

98
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.300
What you might say is that love is where you willingly give of

99
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.200
yourself for someone else's good.

100
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.100
Even if they can't pay you back and even if they don't deserve it.

101
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.000
That's true. Love.

102
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.300
It's not a feeling that you can fall into or fall out

103
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.400
of no matter what that country song tells you right you can't

104
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.500
fall into this feeling love is actually an action

105
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.400
love is a choice you make to act in

106
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.000
a certain way towards someone.

107
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.700
That's how Jesus can up the Annie on this and say love your

108
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.600
enemies.

109
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.300
Because let's be honest. It's really easy for us to

110
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.700
love someone that you feel the affection for right like

111
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.400
you somebody's really kind to you. You're gonna be kind to

112
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.500
them you're sacrifice for them. It's like no back and forth. It's always going

113
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.400
to be easy to do that. But the true essence of

114
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.700
love.

115
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.700
Is when you seek the good of those that you don't feel

116
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.000
that feeling for.

117
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.700
For that jerk coworker that you're thinking of right now.

118
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.200
For that neighbor who's always criticizing the way you do your

119
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.300
yard, whatever it like that that hard hard to

120
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.300
love church member that that one that you deal with

121
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.200
in your family that bully at school. Whatever it is like

122
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.100
that person. That's not easy to love.

123
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.400
Yet we're still commanded.

124
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.500
To love even those who are opposed to us.

125
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.200
So love has to be something different than just a feeling.

126
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.200
But it is a main theme of the scriptures.

127
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.200
In fact in just this short but powerful section. We're going

128
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.800
to study today.

129
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.400
Six verses hey kids

130
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.100
and students. I want you to do this as I'm reading through this count how many

131
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.900
times you see a variation of the form love?

132
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.700
Beloved loved loving anything just

133
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.400
count how many times in just six verses this word

134
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.800
shows up agape.

135
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.300
First Corinthians 4 look at verses 7 through 12

136
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.700
beloved

137
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200
let us love one another.

138
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.300
For love is from God and whoever loves has

139
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.700
been born of God and knows God.

140
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.100
Anyone who does not love does not know God because God

141
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.700
is love.

142
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.700
In this the love of God was made manifest Among Us that

143
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.500
God sent his only son into the world so that

144
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.500
we might live through him.

145
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.600
In this is love not that we have loved God, but

146
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.200
that he loved us and sent his son to be the

147
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.600
propitiation for our sins.

148
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.000
Beloved if God so loved us. We also

149
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.600
ought to love one another.

150
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.100
No one has ever seen God.

151
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.100
If we love one another God abides in us

152
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.200
and his love is perfected in US.

153
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.500
God we need you to see what you want us to see open

154
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.300
our hearts our minds our our eyes to see

155
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.700
how you want to affect our lives with

156
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.900
this very passage today.

157
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.900
Show us your love show us how to love.

158
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.300
Change our hearts towards love today for your glory in

159
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.600
Jesus name. Amen.

160
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.500
Now as I hope you can see as I was reading through that there's really only one main application

161
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.300
Point here and it's pretty simple like what we do.

162
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.700
Love one another isn't that

163
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.000
complicated today? Love one another?

164
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.400
But here's the thing that command is actually implied here. It's not explicit but

165
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.000
it is there.

166
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.100
Because in verse 7. It's it's in what we call

167
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.700
the subjunctive mood, which means it's more like he's pleading

168
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.000
with his readers to to love.

169
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.300
He's like a pep rally kind of like come on guys. Let's love

170
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.300
we need we need a love like this guys. Let's this what

171
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.200
we need to do.

172
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.600
Then in verse 11, it's more of a conditional statement that

173
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.200
assumes positive response.

174
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.100
So it's not if God has loved us like this. He's saying since God

175
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.400
has loved us like this. This is

176
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:03.700
what we do.

177
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.000
we love

178
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.500
Right, so this is assumed but it's there

179
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.400
and remember this this love one. Another command was a

180
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.800
close second to Jesus when he was asked to summarize

181
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.200
the law he gave them the great commandment.

182
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.900
And first was love God with everything you are.

183
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.300
But he said a second is like it.

184
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.200
To love your neighbor as yourself.

185
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.600
And so what he's saying in that is he's not saying there's there's two

186
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.100
commands. He's saying the way you love God with all

187
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.900
that you are is by loving others by

188
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.100
loving your neighbor as yourself, you're you're willingly

189
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.300
self-sacrificing for the good

190
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.100
of those around you even when they don't deserve it and even

191
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.800
when they can ever pay you back.

192
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.100
That's love according to God.

193
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.700
Okay, so it's pretty simple. We know what we're supposed to do. Right? Let's go go. Love one

194
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.800
another right? Well, okay, what why?

195
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.800
Why should we love one another?

196
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.400
Well, you saw a couple reasons here. We know we could

197
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.000
just say we should love but but there's there's basis behind

198
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.000
it. Look at what verse 7 says.

199
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.600
It says that love is from God.

200
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.700
That's one reason we should love one. Another is because love is from

201
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.400
God. This is the only way we know

202
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.800
what Love Actually is is how

203
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.700
he loves us.

204
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.400
It's from him. It's like growing up watching my my

205
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.200
grandpa. Love my grandma.

206
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.000
By the way, my grandma's sitting right over here today. It's kind of an honor for that, but it

207
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.100
wasn't perfect.

208
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.400
But I learned how to love my

209
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.200
wife today.

210
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.600
By watching him love her as he

211
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:51.800
did.

212
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.600
serving giving and sacrificing

213
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.200
not at all for himself, but just to give away and so

214
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.500
I learned Love by watching him love is

215
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.700
from God. We love now because

216
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.000
he first loved us.

217
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.900
He gives love he is the distributor and

218
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.000
definer of love but we have to

219
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.200
ask the question. How do we even know? What love is how do we know what God's love

220
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.100
even looks like

221
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.700
Well, thankfully we have some pictures of that.

222
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.200
The first is because his love according to

223
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.800
this passage was revealed on Christmas.

224
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.100
His love was revealed on Christmas.

225
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.600
Look at verse 9.

226
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.400
In this in other words what I'm about to say in this

227
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.500
the love of God was made manifest Among Us that

228
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.500
God sent his only son into the world so

229
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.800
that we might live through him.

230
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.400
see that

231
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.200
God sending his son into the world

232
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.200
is how his love was made visible.

233
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.300
How his love was made evident manifest how

234
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.900
his love was revealed was through Christmas?

235
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.700
That's the gift. We celebrate at Christmas, right John 3:16 for

236
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.500
God so loved the world. God loved the

237
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.700
world in this way. We might say.

238
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.000
That he sent his only son.

239
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.200
And whoever believes in him would not perish but have eternal life.

240
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.100
This was God's Christmas present to us.

241
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.400
Was his son.

242
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.100
He gave because he loved.

243
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.500
We shouldn't start with our fickle examples of Love here on

244
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.400
this Earth because just think about the people you love the

245
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:37.500
most.

246
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.200
You've hurt them at some

247
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.500
point, right?

248
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.700
They've hurt you.

249
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.700
And so even in our fickle love we we hurt

250
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.400
each other, but we shouldn't start then with that as our picture

251
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:51.800
of love.

252
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.100
We should start with God.

253
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.600
That his love of sending his son.

254
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.200
Is How We Know What Love looks like

255
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.500
So his love was revealed at Christmas, but also this passage

256
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.200
shows us that it was proven on Good Friday.

257
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.500
His love was proven.

258
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.400
Look at verse 10 on Good Friday.

259
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.000
In this is love now. This is

260
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.100
entering you can't see this in the English translation, but in the Greek original

261
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.800
language it says in this is the love.

262
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.300
Like so so this is the it love like this

263
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.300
is the top you don't get anything better than this in. This

264
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.600
is the love the defining love of every other

265
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.400
type of love the love. Not that we've loved God.

266
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.300
But that he loved us and sent his son

267
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.400
to be the propitiation for our sins.

268
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.300
So notice this Christmas present God loved us enough to give was

269
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.300
not just sending Jesus to go hang out with people do some

270
00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.900
cool Miracles and then head back home.

271
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.000
Now there was a purpose to the sending.

272
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.700
The father sent Jesus to be what?

273
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.000
the propitiation for our sins

274
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.000
Now that's a long big word. I know let's practice that for a second

275
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.300
so you can use it at Christmas next week with your family, right? So, let's say

276
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.700
it propitiation, okay?

277
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.400
Won the world is that even mean we don't use that in Daily

278
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.300
Language. And so what does it mean? It just means a lot.

279
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.400
Let's say it that way.

280
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.900
This is actually John taking a pagan

281
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.500
word from classic Greek and

282
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.500
changing its meaning to give it a theological

283
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.100
basis.

284
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.500
The originally these Pagan worshipers would

285
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.500
go their Temple and they would worship whatever God and they

286
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.300
would they would make these gifts.

287
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.500
To their God to appease his wrath and

288
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.200
hopefully win over his favor.

289
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.400
Basically, they were taking presents to this gift this God to

290
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.300
try to win him over and try to to buy them off so they

291
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.000
don't have any wrath and that they they know he's gonna be

292
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.600
on their side all of that kind of thing, but the big difference here that

293
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.900
John uses this term

294
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.000
He's he's saying in a way reminding us that hey remember Yahweh

295
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.500
does not need any gifts.

296
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.600
To win his favor towards us because God

297
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.300
already loves us.

298
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.400
He already has affection and favor towards us

299
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.400
yet at the same time. He's also

300
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:31.900
holy.

301
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.700
And his Justice towards sin will only be

302
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.400
satisfied.

303
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.700
through the penalty of death

304
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.200
and so you can bring all the gifts you want over here. You can do all

305
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.300
these things to try to win him over and get them on your side actually.

306
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.900
God doesn't need any gifts from you.

307
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.600
Yet he does demand death for sin.

308
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:00.300
That's why.

309
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.900
When Jesus was hanging on the cross.

310
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.000
He's about to die.

311
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.800
What did he shout he shouted it is finished.

312
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.400
Was he talking about he's talking about his life. No, he's talking

313
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.500
about this.

314
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.500
That he had satisfied in his death

315
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.500
on the cross the demands of the law.

316
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.600
That all of the the penalty of sin

317
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.700
that was due to the sinner.

318
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.900
the death demanded

319
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.900
Jesus said I did it. It's finished.

320
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.700
I took penalty.

321
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.400
I love how Spurgeon said it. He said the debt was

322
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.500
now to the last penny all discharged.

323
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.200
The atonement and propitiation were made once and for

324
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.100
all and forever.

325
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.200
by the one offering made in Jesus body on the

326
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.600
tree

327
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.100
There was the cup hell was in it

328
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.300
the Savior drank it not a sip

329
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.400
and then a pause not a swig and then a ceasing he

330
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.500
drained it till there was not a drop left for any

331
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.000
of his people.

332
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.900
All the judgment on sin was carried and

333
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.600
finished on the cross.

334
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.300
Like what what great love is this?

335
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.200
Well, we could never love him well enough.

336
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.700
We could never earn our way to him yet. God loved

337
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.000
us and sent Jesus to be nailed on that

338
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.000
cross to die in our place.

339
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.500
And that's what reconciled us to him as it wiped away

340
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.300
the Obstacle of sin that kept us from

341
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.300
him previously.

342
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.200
We now have access.

343
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.100
What great love is that is that not

344
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.300
the perfect demonstration of what Paul trip defined as

345
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:52.700
love?

346
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.200
Right that that nowhere else nowhere else.

347
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.700
Do we see that willing self-sacrifice Illustrated like

348
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.600
what Jesus did

349
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:04.700
especially

350
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.100
since we could never repay him for it.

351
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.500
And especially since we don't ever deserve it

352
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.200
at all.

353
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.500
Romans 5:8 God showed his love for

354
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.800
us in this that while we were still sinners Christ

355
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.800
died for us.

356
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.200
That's how we see his love is proven.

357
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.200
In his death on Good Friday.

358
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.400
Love is from God.

359
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.500
Now, why does he get to Define love and nobody else?

360
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.200
I mean, why don't we get to Define love because we Define it certain ways and

361
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.000
we would enjoy this or enjoy that why does he get to say What

362
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:50.500
Love Is

363
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.100
Well, because God is love

364
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.600
according to first John 4.

365
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.500
He defines love because he is it that's

366
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.300
the other verse the reason verse 8 gave us for why we ought

367
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.200
to love one another not only is Love from God love is part

368
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.800
of his nature.

369
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.400
God is love.

370
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.300
That's what it says right here.

371
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.400
Not here's maybe a shift in your thinking not just is

372
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.300
God loving towards you.

373
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.300
He is in his very nature love.

374
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.300
He defines it. He makes it up we

375
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.900
go back to this all the time, but when God told Moses in

376
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.600
Exodus 34 about himself.

377
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.200
Just listen to what God says.

378
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.200
The Lord, this is Yahweh the Lord

379
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.800
a god merciful and gracious.

380
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.000
Slow to anger abounding instead

381
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.100
fast, love and faithfulness.

382
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.500
That's that Hess said steadfast love. This is

383
00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.500
who he is. He is love here's

384
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.200
the problem with this.

385
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.800
Unfortunately many people have flipped

386
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.200
that around in our day.

387
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.900
And said love is God.

388
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.700
and so whatever I feel

389
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.700
whatever makes me happy.

390
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.600
That defines everything else.

391
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.900
or even saying that

392
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.500
God is only love.

393
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.400
So I can do whatever I want because there's no ramification of their

394
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:35.500
side.

395
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.700
And you better celebrate it because this is who I am.

396
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.100
Listen, none of that's true, right?

397
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.200
None of that is true.

398
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.700
It's like a diamond has so many facets.

399
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.800
God is love but also God is Holy.

400
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.500
Remember, he's he's holy and listen, that's a good thing that

401
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.100
he's holy because that means he's going to fix what's broken someday.

402
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.200
He is just

403
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.100
that he's one day going to make right all that has been

404
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.400
wrong. He's going to set right and clear away all

405
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.100
the evil. That is good news for us that he's

406
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.600
holy and he's just

407
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.100
But it should also cause us to pause a little bit of how we're living

408
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.500
how we're talking how we're believing.

409
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.900
But listen, even even the justice

410
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.600
of God the Holiness of God is driven by

411
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.500
his love.

412
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.300
Because what's he doing?

413
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.200
In clearing out the evil. What's he doing in

414
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.600
in setting everything right for his people? He's

415
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.400
working for their good.

416
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.600
He's working for our good if we are his people he's working for our

417
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.900
good which is part of the definition of love, right?

418
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.000
willing self-sacrifice for the good

419
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.600
of another he's working for our best that Justice.

420
00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.600
Is driven by his love?

421
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.400
so love is who God is

422
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.300
since he's loved us like this. We should love

423
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.700
others as well.

424
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.200
But here's what I want to I want you to see in this is that not

425
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.400
only does it give us motivation to do this

426
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.700
because of what he bases this off of but also he

427
00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.500
lays out results.

428
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.000
He shows us what will happen.

429
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.700
when we love

430
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.900
when we live out this kind of love in response

431
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.300
to his love for us. Here's what's going to happen.

432
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.500
The first point is clear.

433
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.300
when we love

434
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.400
our faith is shown.

435
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.300
First John 4 says that whenever we love others our

436
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.500
faith is made evident.

437
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.600
Look again at verses 7 and 8.

438
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.700
Beloved let us love one. Another for love is from God and whoever

439
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.200
loves has been born of God and knows God.

440
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.300
Anyone who does not love does not know God because God

441
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.300
is love.

442
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.500
Now John does not pull any punches here.

443
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.500
Very direct speaking about the affirmative

444
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.600
that those who love or

445
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.200
this way, but also warning those who are

446
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:22.700
not loving.

447
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.700
And he says here that if you have received God's love

448
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.400
for you, you will love others like this is part

449
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:30.800
of the deal.

450
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.500
If you have received his love, you will

451
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.400
love others and what that will do is improve two things. It'll

452
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.900
prove first that you have been reborn of God.

453
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.200
Now that means like a spiritual rebirth that you've

454
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.300
been given a new life as second Corinthians 5 says

455
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.800
you've been made a new creation. You've been given a new heart whose heart.

456
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.600
if God's heart

457
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.400
God is love love is from God.

458
00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.000
So if you have his heart what's going to come out of you?

459
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.400
Love right. That's the point you you've proving that

460
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.400
you have been born of God, but the

461
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.600
second Point you're also proving that, you know, God.

462
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.700
Not just that, you know about God.

463
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.400
But like Buddy the elf with Santa right like I know him, you

464
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.400
know God.

465
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.200
Like I know a lot about chip gains.

466
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.400
But I know my wife, you know, you see a difference like

467
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.200
that. I know those things differently.

468
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.500
This is the idea here is that you actually know God you

469
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.700
have a relationship with you're proving that you know him

470
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.700
and who he is.

471
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.300
films out of you

472
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.300
Loving others proves your faith, but the counters also true here.

473
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.200
You see that in verse 8.

474
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.700
Anyone who does not love does not know God because

475
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.000
God is love.

476
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.600
Now this might be the hardest part of this whole thing.

477
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.600
because when you go around our city

478
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.100
or our area region, whatever and you ask most

479
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.400
people

480
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.300
They would consider themselves a loving person wouldn't they?

481
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:11.800
most everybody would

482
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.200
Of course, we're loving of course. We're loving I'm not murdering anybody. Of course.

483
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.700
I'm a loving person. Right? Like that's what we would all say.

484
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.300
With so much of what we call love today.

485
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.300
is demanding

486
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:30.900
selfish

487
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.500
it's transactional.

488
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:35.700
It's conditional.

489
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:38.100
It's

490
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.100
it's what's in it for me. That's what kind

491
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.400
of what we call love.

492
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.300
Like yeah, I'll love you. I'll love you as long

493
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.600
as in the end I get that.

494
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:52.800
or

495
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.700
or I'll love you.

496
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.500
Until you go too far.

497
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.000
I'll love you.

498
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.600
until you don't

499
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.000
look attractive to me anymore.

500
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.800
Like you see how conditional and transactional and

501
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.900
all these things are are not true. Love at all.

502
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.100
because Jesus said

503
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.000
we must love even our enemies.

504
00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.900
That's you're not going to feel anything for them. That's a

505
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.600
different level of love, right?

506
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:27.800
But that's the whole point of this.

507
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.200
That's the whole point of what he's talking about here. This is

508
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:31.600
the measure.

509
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.400
See how we know that we've been transformed by God's

510
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.200
love for us is when we love people who don't

511
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.900
love us back.

512
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.100
That's how you know, you really are a loving person. Look at

513
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.700
first, it's not in first John. It's in Luke. Luke says

514
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.300
this this isn't sermon amount recording what Jesus said Luke 6

515
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.400
32 through 35. He says if you love those who love you what

516
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.300
benefit is that to you?

517
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.800
For even Sinners love those who love them.

518
00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.000
Of course, they're gonna yeah, you're kind your transactional.

519
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.100
It's all gonna go back and forth really? Well, of course, I'm gonna love

520
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:04.300
them.

521
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.100
And if you do good to those who do good to you. What benefit is

522
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.600
that to you? Even Sinners do the same?

523
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.300
And if you lend to those who from whom you expect to receive what

524
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.100
credit is that to you even Sinners lend to Sinners to

525
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.800
get back the same amount.

526
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.200
That's what the world does. Jesus says though.

527
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:22.900
Love your enemies.

528
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.500
And do good.

529
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.000
and lend

530
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.600
expecting nothing in return

531
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.100
And your reward will be great and you'll be

532
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.800
sons of the most high for he is kind to The Ungrateful

533
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.700
and the evil.

534
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.300
He's not saying you can earn your salvation. He's saying if you

535
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.600
truly have been born of God, if you're a child of

536
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.100
God, that's how you are going to live.

537
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.700
You're going to give and do good

538
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.100
and and lend without anything wanting to

539
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.100
come back on you like you don't want anything back. It's just Who You

540
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.900
Are.

541
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.300
Because again, it's easy to love those who love

542
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:06.500
you.

543
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.500
Who pay you back who give a lot to you as well? It's super simple,

544
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.400
but it's christ-like to love those who hate

545
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:13.600
you.

546
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.200
It's Christ like to love those who who you

547
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.000
want to to not be around very much, but you still sacrifice for

548
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.500
their good as well.

549
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.500
Now I know what you're thinking.

550
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.200
But aren't they going to start taking advantage of me?

551
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.800
What do you think happened to Jesus?

552
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.700
Jesus whole life was sacrificing was giving

553
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.400
away was serving so that other people could benefit.

554
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.700
He was helping other people flourish.

555
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.600
And the religious leaders killed him for it.

556
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.200
And yet even in that Jesus allowed that death.

557
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.500
for our good

558
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.200
even that was others focused.

559
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.100
How do you know?

560
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.600
This listen I marinated this all week. And this was

561
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:12.900
hard.

562
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.400
How do you know if you really are loving person?

563
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.500
Because this standard is looking like whoa, I

564
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:20.800
mean none of us.

565
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.800
How do we know if we are actually a loving person or not?

566
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.400
Well don't start by comparing yourself to

567
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.400
other decent human beings in Middle America.

568
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.200
Because when you start looking around like yeah, I'm a loving person. I mean

569
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.400
because everybody else is that's what we do. I let people go at the stoplight

570
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.100
and all that. Yeah. I'm a kind person. I you know, I'm loving.

571
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.300
But but listen, our standard should be higher than that.

572
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.200
Our standard should be Jesus and the way he lived

573
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.100
his life because that blows everything. We're doing out of

574
00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:57.500
the water here.

575
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.200
Here's some questions to start asking to really dig into

576
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.800
whether you are a loving person or not.

577
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.100
Do I truly sacrifice for others?

578
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.800
Is my life all about me?

579
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.800
Do I do whatever I want without considering others?

580
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.900
Think about that in a marriage.

581
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:31.900
family

582
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.200
Do I reach across boundaries?

583
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.000
To be with people who are not like me.

584
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.100
To love and care for those where it might be

585
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.100
a little more challenging. It might be something that's going to confront some things in my

586
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.000
heart. Do I love like that?

587
00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.200
Do I ever affect my own comfortable Lifestyle

588
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.400
by how much I'm generously giving to

589
00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:58.700
other people.

590
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:01.900
that's

591
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.900
that's a deep do it. Does it ever cost you anything?

592
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:07.400
to give

593
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.400
maybe even

594
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.500
This week sometime this afternoon.

595
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.200
reading through

596
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.200
a passage of scripture that the heading in my

597
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.100
Bible says marks of the true Christian

598
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.100
something we should listen to.

599
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.000
But listen to Romans 12:9 through 21 describe.

600
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.100
a lifestyle of love

601
00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.900
let love be genuine.

602
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.200
Abhor hate what is evil?

603
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.300
Hold fast to what is good.

604
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.400
Love one another with brotherly affection.

605
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.500
outdo one another in showing honor

606
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.400
do not be slothful or lazy and Zeal

607
00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.000
be fervent in spirit serve the Lord rejoice in

608
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.300
Hope be patient in Tribulation be constant

609
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:03.800
in prayer.

610
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.100
Contribute to the needs of the Saints and seek to

611
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:07.900
show hospitality.

612
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.600
It's going to dig deeper now bless those who persecute

613
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:13.800
you.

614
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.600
Bless and do not curse them Rejoice with

615
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.600
those who Rejoice weep with those who weep even unbelievers

616
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.400
live in harmony with one another do not

617
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.200
be haughty prideful but associate with

618
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.100
the lowly never be wise in your own sight.

619
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.700
Repay, no one evil for evil.

620
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.800
But give thought to do what is Honorable in the sight of all.

621
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.900
if possible so far as it depends on you live peaceably with

622
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.200
all

623
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.100
beloved never avenge yourself, but leave it to

624
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.200
the wrath of God for it is written vengeance is mine.

625
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.300
I'll repay says the Lord.

626
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.100
To the contrary if your enemy is hungry feed him

627
00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.200
if he's thirsty give him something to drink.

628
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.400
For by so doing he'll eat burning coals on his head.

629
00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.800
And do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good.

630
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.800
Go through that and just start grating your life.

631
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.800
And listen, I know how difficult this is.

632
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.200
I mean again, we're looking at this and and we're thinking

633
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.400
that none of us are going to make it.

634
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.500
None of us are true Christians now. It's easy to look at

635
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.800
a moment of your week.

636
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.900
Or a strained family relationship and

637
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.600
you look at this and you think man I'm out question the

638
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:30.700
whole thing.

639
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.100
Blew up on my kid on Wednesday like I'm out. I guess

640
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.800
I'm not a Christian like no listen.

641
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.200
Don't judge your life in a sliver of time.

642
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.400
If that's true, none of us would make it.

643
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.600
What we should think of is more what are the trends of

644
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:53.900
your life?

645
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.000
Where is god making you more

646
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.300
like himself? How is he

647
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.900
growing you in love? How are you progressing towards Romans

648
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.100
12 more than you were a year

649
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.300
ago 10 years ago. Like I know it's gonna look like this when

650
00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.100
you think of the trend upward it's gonna look like up and down

651
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.600
through your life day to day week by week, but the general Trend

652
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.600
should be towards Jesus.

653
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.000
Towards Christ likeness towards Romans 12.

654
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.100
Again, if you just judge it by one sliver it looked like this

655
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.700
for a second but over time.

656
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.000
What are the trends?

657
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.600
Are you allowing God to make you more loving?

658
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.300
Because Jesus said in John 13:35 our love for one another

659
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.100
will Mark us office his disciples.

660
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.100
That's talking to you as an individual me as an

661
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.600
individual and us as a faith family. In other

662
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.700
words. It's our love compelling to people around

663
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.400
us. Do they see it do they know that's one of our values as

664
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.700
a church compelling love that people see how much we

665
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.300
love each other.

666
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.400
And they they see Jesus they they're compelled to want

667
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:02.800
to believe.

668
00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.500
It's like it's like you have a birthmark from from birth, right?

669
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.200
You didn't earn it. You didn't manufacture that

670
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.300
you didn't try to get that your kids might ask you that a

671
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.700
lot. Right? Like what is this spot on my leg? Well, that's a birthmark.

672
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.400
our birthmark as Christians

673
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.100
is love

674
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.800
It's it's to be so compelling that people say.

675
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.100
You guys really are Christians. You're like Jesus.

676
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.200
because we love

677
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.100
so this is our faith is shown. Yes, but listen as we

678
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:38.700
celebrate Advent.

679
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.100
The coming of Christ 2,000 years ago.

680
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.700
This love is also how our God is seen

681
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:45.800
today.

682
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.500
It's how our faith is shown but it's also how our God is seen.

683
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.400
Remember what verse 12 said first John 4?

684
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.300
No one has ever seen God.

685
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.100
If we love one another God abides in us

686
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.700
and his love is perfected in us that perfected me

687
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.400
completed. It means finished.

688
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.000
It's like how you used to have to take a film

689
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.300
that you put in a camera kids. There used to be like these cameras

690
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.300
that you put this cartridge into and it would

691
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.200
spin a little bit. He had to take it to it. They take it into a dark

692
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:23.300
room.

693
00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.500
And whatever was on that film would have to be developed

694
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.200
and the image would show up as it was being

695
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.000
developed.

696
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:33.900
this

697
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.600
when we love others is how

698
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.900
the image the picture of God the image

699
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.700
of God in us is developed.

700
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.000
to the world

701
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.600
It's how they see who he

702
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:48.700
is.

703
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.500
It's as we love that we have been reborn spiritually that

704
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.500
his love abides in us. And so since

705
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.000
he's in here he is What flows out of

706
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.100
us and he is love so we reflect his heart for 33

707
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.600
years. It was Jesus on the earth in bodily form.

708
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.900
They saw God there now. It's how

709
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.700
people see him through us.

710
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.200
I read somewhere that the church is God's audio-visual presentation

711
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.400
to a dying culture.

712
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.100
He throw it up on the Whiteboard. You got the

713
00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.800
screen going got the graphs and the charts and all this stuff this

714
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.000
Church

715
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.200
is God's audio-visual presentation to the world

716
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.300
that this is who he is. This is what he looks like.

717
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.300
Let me just think about this.

718
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.200
When you walk around.

719
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.900
at your workplace and you are

720
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.200
Loving your coworkers, even though they're sitting in

721
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.400
the back room gossiping about you.

722
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.000
When we as a church take the massive amount of

723
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.500
resources God's given us and we just give away without any strings attached and

724
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.000
we're just loving churches and neighborhoods and and Ministries

725
00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.400
all over the place without any worry that

726
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.600
they're ever gonna repay us. We're ever gonna get anything out of it. We're just

727
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.200
giving generously.

728
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.400
When you put your spouse and your kids

729
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.100
ahead of yourself at home.

730
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.800
What do they see?

731
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.200
They see God.

732
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.100
They see him he is love they see love lived

733
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.900
out. They know what it looks like.

734
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.400
My favorite verses is 2 Corinthians 3:18 and it

735
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.800
says beholding the glory of the Lord. We are being transformed

736
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.000
into the same image from one degree of

737
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.300
Glory to another this is the Christ likeness growing in

738
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.800
us as we behold the love of God for

739
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.300
us this great love of God for

740
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.900
us. We lift our eyes to him. It's changing us

741
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.900
to be more like him to be more loving like

742
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.700
he is

743
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.400
The life that he came to give us first John 4

744
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.400
says the more we live in that understand what that

745
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.400
life is like in Christ and he

746
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.700
loves us so deeply the more we will love others.

747
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.800
unbeliever This Is The Love

748
00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.400
That you have been longing for your entire life.

749
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.100
the love of God

750
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.400
For you, it's not found in a person. It's not found

751
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.000
in a post.

752
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.400
The love of God for you, when you see your need

753
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.100
for that love of the Savior and you turn from

754
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:33.000
yourself and you turn to him and repentance and faith that

755
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.200
he died in your place.

756
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.000
That's the love that washes over you and fills you.

757
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.600
That you've always been empty.

758
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.700
This is the love of God you need.

759
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.600
but also believer

760
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.300
This is the love that was meant to Mark us off as his.

761
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.000
That no matter what you feel today. Remember this?

762
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.100
No matter what you feel today or no matter what you feel

763
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.900
tomorrow or whatever. It is Romans 8 says nothing.

764
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.400
Nothing can separate you from the love of God in Christ

765
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:08.600
Jesus.

766
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.500
He what kind of love the father has given to

767
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.600
us that we should be called children of God first

768
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.100
John three.

769
00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.100
that in itself

770
00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.500
an enemy of God now made a child of

771
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.100
God that means listen if you walked in here feeling unloved

772
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.200
you walked in your feeling unworthy for whatever

773
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.200
reason see this if God has taken you

774
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.400
from death to life from enemy to child. That means

775
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.100
you're his

776
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.700
and that means you're worthy.

777
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.600
He loves you more than you can ever imagine.

778
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.500
This is shown in his gift.

779
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.300
of Christmas Good Friday and his gift of Resurrection

780
00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.000
and his gift of his holy spirit living inside of you

781
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.400
Christian.

782
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:04.600
He loves you.

783
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.600
He saved you and now hear me. He is empowered you

784
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.100
to go love other people just like he's loved you.

785
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.000
rest in his love

786
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.300
It's the fourth candle. We're going to light today fourth candle

787
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.100
the Advent wreath.

788
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.700
Hope then peace then joy, and now love is added

789
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.200
to that. I want to invite the radial family up here

790
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.200
to lead us through that they serve in our kids and

791
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.400
students Ministries. They serve as Celebrate Recovery

792
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.600
disciple making all kinds of ways. They're gonna read some

793
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.600
scripture about love.

794
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.800
Light the candles and then pray for us in

795
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.700
our heart towards the Messiah.

796
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.900
So let's worship together.

797
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.800
Romans 5 6 through 8 for while

798
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.600
we were so weak at the right time Christ died

799
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.600
for the ungodly for one will scarcely die

800
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.300
for a righteous person though perhaps for

801
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.500
a good person one would dare even to die. But

802
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.200
God shows his love for us in that while we were

803
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.900
still sinners Christ died for us.

804
00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:56.900
Will you pray with us?

805
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.000
Precious Holy Father. We thank you Lord for

806
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.300
your presence with us today and for all our Brothers and Sisters in

807
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.500
Christ here to worship you.

808
00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.600
God as we continue on in this season of Advent and focus this

809
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.800
week on your love for us.

810
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.400
I'm so thankful for your word that reminds us

811
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.700
just how much truly love us.

812
00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.300
God we can never do enough to earn your love and in our

813
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.300
sins. We are as far apart from you as the East

814
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:29.900
is from the West.

815
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.800
But God in the fact that you are love.

816
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.900
You gave us the best.

817
00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.200
And most precious gift in your sons, Jesus Christ.

818
00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.800
We thank you for his wonderful and perfectly timed

819
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:43.900
birth.

820
00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.000
And for the Eternal salvation and forgiveness of

821
00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.200
our sins you deliver to us through his

822
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:50.800
perfect life.

823
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.900
death and Resurrection

824
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.600
I pray God as Christ Believers and followers

825
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.300
that we would live out your love for us

826
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.500
as we seek to bring this Same Love.

827
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.300
To every person that has yet to hear this wonderful news.

828
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.600
And had their lives changed.

829
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.200
Father we thank you, and we love you

830
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:12.600
so much.

831
00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.200
It's on the precious name of Jesus Christ. We pray

832
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:16.800
amen.
