00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:43.455
The year was 1835 when a young man named George Mueller

2
00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:48.175
discovered that there were only about 12 orphan homes in all

3
00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:49.575
of England and Wales.

4
00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:54.615
And so he decided to act, he moved to Bristol.

5
00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.655
And when he got to Bristol

6
00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:00.055
after God had changed his life when he was in college,

7
00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:01.655
he got to Brissell

8
00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:05.935
and saw that for an orphan in that city, they had

9
00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:08.335
to pay a fee to live in one of those group homes.

10
00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:09.775
Or if they couldn't pay,

11
00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:12.255
they were basically enslaved in a workhouse.

12
00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:18.035
And so he and his wife sold all their possessions,

13
00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:20.635
gave all the money to the poor,

14
00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:23.915
and began praying for God to begin an orphan home

15
00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:25.075
through their lives.

16
00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:31.355
And God provided He began to bring orphans

17
00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:34.755
because, 'cause George's desire was

18
00:01:34.755 --> 00:01:36.435
that he wanted this place to be a place

19
00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:38.195
that no orphan would be turned away

20
00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:40.395
because of poverty or because of race.

21
00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:44.115
He wanted them to be trained and educated for a trade.

22
00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:47.755
And, and so God provided and began to bring orphans

23
00:01:47.815 --> 00:01:50.115
and orphans and orphans to his door.

24
00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:51.755
And God

25
00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:55.555
provided just what they needed at just the right time.

26
00:01:57.255 --> 00:01:59.515
Now, it didn't mean that it was always easy.

27
00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:03.315
There were times whenever all the orphans would sit down

28
00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:06.915
and the staff would sit down to eat with no food in front

29
00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:09.235
of them and they would pray

30
00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:14.295
and God would provide, whether it was a baker

31
00:02:14.475 --> 00:02:15.695
who had a dream the night

32
00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:19.775
before that he needed to bake an extra measure of bread

33
00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:22.695
and bring it to him at the orphanage,

34
00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.415
or whether it was a milk cart that broke down

35
00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:27.295
outside the orphanage

36
00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:30.295
and it would've spoiled if it wasn't used immediately.

37
00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:36.445
God provided, it's estimated

38
00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:38.365
that throughout his lifetime, Mueller gave away

39
00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:41.365
what would be equivalent today of $129 million,

40
00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:47.005
helping over 18,000 children in need.

41
00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:53.045
The main British newspaper wrote at Mueller's death

42
00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:56.245
that he had robbed the cruel streets of thousands

43
00:02:56.245 --> 00:03:00.125
of victims, the jails of thousands of felons

44
00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:03.965
and the workhouses of thousands of helpless waves.

45
00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:10.405
Now, I, I realize that some people have started orphanages

46
00:03:10.405 --> 00:03:12.725
by faith and they didn't succeed like this.

47
00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:16.205
They might have even fallen apart or failed.

48
00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:23.335
And I know that Mueller's pattern of praying

49
00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:29.135
and not asking for money isn't the way we all have to do it.

50
00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:33.875
He's not the universal principle here.

51
00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:35.395
I start with his story

52
00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:37.955
because of what was in his heart,

53
00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:44.825
his desire to be generous with everything

54
00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:46.865
God entrusted to him

55
00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:54.225
to follow Christ's example that we see taught in Romans 1213

56
00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:58.145
to contribute to the needs of the saints.

57
00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:02.785
See, that's what we're doing this summer in this series

58
00:04:02.785 --> 00:04:06.945
called realigned, is we are taking Christ's perfect standard

59
00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:13.665
and we are realigning our lives by the Holy Spirit's power

60
00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:17.665
back towards that we're not there

61
00:04:18.085 --> 00:04:22.265
and we need to be realigned with Christ's life,

62
00:04:22.275 --> 00:04:25.705
which includes in our generosity.

63
00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:30.775
And here's why all this is so important,

64
00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:35.595
because nearly more than anything else in our lives,

65
00:04:36.935 --> 00:04:38.835
our view and use of money

66
00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.195
reveals the true state of our hearts.

67
00:04:43.005 --> 00:04:47.405
It reveals the idols that are actually in there.

68
00:04:50.335 --> 00:04:51.715
Here's how Jesus said it.

69
00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:56.795
Matthew six 19 through 21, he saiddo not lay up

70
00:04:56.795 --> 00:05:00.315
for yourself treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy

71
00:05:00.315 --> 00:05:01.875
and where thieves break in and steal.

72
00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:04.355
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven

73
00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:07.275
where neither moth nor rust destroys.

74
00:05:07.275 --> 00:05:08.795
And where thieves do not break in

75
00:05:08.795 --> 00:05:13.155
and steal for where your treasure is there,

76
00:05:13.155 --> 00:05:14.755
your heart will be also.

77
00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:20.095
And verse 24, he says, no one can serve two masters

78
00:05:21.515 --> 00:05:23.415
for either he will hate the one and love the other,

79
00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:26.335
or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.

80
00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:30.095
You cannot serve God and money.

81
00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.445
I heard Tim Keller talk about this one time

82
00:05:34.445 --> 00:05:36.565
that we could actually flip around verse 21

83
00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:40.405
and say it this way, where your heart is

84
00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:46.555
there, your treasure will follow where your heart is,

85
00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:49.355
that's where your treasure will flow.

86
00:05:50.685 --> 00:05:53.415
Meaning he asked this question, just think about this.

87
00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:58.245
What is it effortless for to spend money on?

88
00:06:01.005 --> 00:06:02.775
Like when you think about the way you spend money,

89
00:06:02.775 --> 00:06:03.975
like what is just effortless?

90
00:06:04.315 --> 00:06:06.135
It doesn't take any thought, no question.

91
00:06:06.195 --> 00:06:10.455
You just spend it that reveals where your heart is,

92
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.335
where your heart is, your treasure will flow.

93
00:06:13.525 --> 00:06:15.215
What that reveals where your heart, that reveal,

94
00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:18.375
that reveals where your identity is found.

95
00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:20.895
Because that's what you're looking for for me,

96
00:06:21.955 --> 00:06:24.905
is travel new experiences.

97
00:06:25.815 --> 00:06:27.745
Like I just can't wait to do something new

98
00:06:27.745 --> 00:06:30.145
and see something new and experience something new that

99
00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:31.945
that, that means I'm going to spend money

100
00:06:31.945 --> 00:06:34.985
that it's effortless to to, for you it might be close.

101
00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.825
It's not that for me, I got clothes

102
00:06:37.825 --> 00:06:39.025
that are 20 years old, right?

103
00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:42.545
But my identity is not found in the way I look or dress.

104
00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:46.545
It might be for you. And so your, your budget shows

105
00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:48.905
that the flowing of your treasure goes

106
00:06:48.905 --> 00:06:50.025
to where your heart is.

107
00:06:52.585 --> 00:06:57.085
Or it might be your kids that you're flowing that treasure

108
00:06:57.225 --> 00:06:59.885
to them because your heart is like, I want to make sure

109
00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:02.765
that they are secure and that's your idol.

110
00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:04.565
Maybe, or,

111
00:07:04.585 --> 00:07:08.565
or maybe it is something as simple as saving money, that

112
00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.645
that's your, your idol of security

113
00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:13.085
that you gotta make sure everything is secure for later

114
00:07:13.185 --> 00:07:15.365
and you gotta make sure you're gonna control the future

115
00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:19.725
so you have enough all and that's revealing your heart.

116
00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:24.715
So here's the question today.

117
00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:31.835
Is it effortless for you to give money to

118
00:07:32.775 --> 00:07:37.295
the needy or to God's kingdom through his church?

119
00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:44.435
Is it as effortless? Is it as normal?

120
00:07:45.885 --> 00:07:47.745
Is it as easy for you to do that

121
00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:49.585
and say, yes, take this here, give that.

122
00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:51.145
Here's what you need. I'm gonna provide,

123
00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:52.425
is it effortless for that?

124
00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.885
If it's not, what does

125
00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:59.515
that reveal about your heart, about

126
00:07:59.515 --> 00:08:02.115
what you're treasuring in your life?

127
00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:07.475
That's why I hope Romans 1213 moves the needle

128
00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:11.595
for us a little bit today closer to what Jesus was quoted

129
00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:15.075
as saying in, in Acts 2035, Jesus himself said, it is better

130
00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:18.315
to give than to receive.

131
00:08:20.765 --> 00:08:23.865
That's our goal today. So let's pray towards that end.

132
00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:26.145
Lord, I I ask you by your spirit's power

133
00:08:26.145 --> 00:08:28.905
to help us understand what you want us to understand

134
00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.345
and see what you want us to see today.

135
00:08:30.345 --> 00:08:33.185
And Lord, if it means that you're gonna lay a, a, a heavy

136
00:08:33.835 --> 00:08:35.985
conviction on our souls, that we be ready

137
00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:37.185
and receptive to that.

138
00:08:37.965 --> 00:08:40.345
If it means you're gonna encourage us to do more of

139
00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:42.985
what we're already doing, then Lord may we rest in that.

140
00:08:45.695 --> 00:08:48.675
But we know we need to be aligned more towards you.

141
00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:52.945
So help us Lord to see it And that you would reveal

142
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.605
where we don't treasure you enough.

143
00:08:58.155 --> 00:09:02.775
We treasure other things more. Help us in Jesus' name.

144
00:09:03.685 --> 00:09:07.955
Amen. So look now at Romans 1213

145
00:09:09.005 --> 00:09:10.995
again, just the first part, phrase by phrase.

146
00:09:10.995 --> 00:09:12.875
It's on you notes, it'll be on the screen as well.

147
00:09:13.015 --> 00:09:17.115
It says contribute to the needs of the saints.

148
00:09:19.055 --> 00:09:21.885
We're gonna see just three simple lessons from

149
00:09:21.885 --> 00:09:23.165
this short phrase.

150
00:09:24.305 --> 00:09:27.565
Here's the first. We learn

151
00:09:27.565 --> 00:09:30.605
that every saint has needs at some point

152
00:09:32.535 --> 00:09:33.845
based just on this phrase.

153
00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:38.205
We learn every saint has needs at some point.

154
00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:42.605
Now, if you're like me, you hear the word saint

155
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.765
and you think like the Roman Catholic stuff, right?

156
00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:48.445
St. Thomas, St.

157
00:09:48.445 --> 00:09:50.325
Luke stuff you've seen in stained glass

158
00:09:50.325 --> 00:09:51.405
windows before, right?

159
00:09:51.405 --> 00:09:52.845
Like you think these people

160
00:09:53.275 --> 00:09:56.645
that in their tradition have been named saints,

161
00:09:56.645 --> 00:09:59.165
that they've claimed lived a, a life of service to others,

162
00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:02.285
that they have two verifiable miracles, one before they died

163
00:10:02.305 --> 00:10:04.205
and one after they died.

164
00:10:04.205 --> 00:10:07.405
That's how you get to be a saint in that tradition.

165
00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:10.765
That's where our mind typically goes.

166
00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:15.565
Now, separate from the many theological disagreements I have

167
00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:19.565
with that, I'm really glad the Bible talks about

168
00:10:19.565 --> 00:10:22.605
that word saint in a completely different way.

169
00:10:25.685 --> 00:10:27.905
The way the Bible uses this word saint, is

170
00:10:27.905 --> 00:10:30.065
that every believer is a saint.

171
00:10:31.355 --> 00:10:34.835
'cause that word itself means one who is set apart, one

172
00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:37.955
who is made holy, one who is made righteous

173
00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:40.195
by something outside of you.

174
00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:41.435
You are changed.

175
00:10:41.695 --> 00:10:44.635
Now none of us can become a saint by what we do.

176
00:10:46.565 --> 00:10:47.705
We are made holy.

177
00:10:47.845 --> 00:10:50.625
We are made righteous by our faith in Jesus.

178
00:10:50.725 --> 00:10:52.345
His blood washes us clean

179
00:10:52.605 --> 00:10:54.665
and we are set apart for his purpose.

180
00:10:54.965 --> 00:10:57.105
We are made into a saint.

181
00:10:57.205 --> 00:11:01.025
Not said we're a saint by someone else. God makes us holy.

182
00:11:04.745 --> 00:11:06.085
Now lemme just take a side note here.

183
00:11:06.085 --> 00:11:08.245
Christian, never forget that

184
00:11:10.575 --> 00:11:15.155
the enemy will tell you lie to you based on

185
00:11:15.155 --> 00:11:17.715
what you've done, what you're struggling with now,

186
00:11:17.905 --> 00:11:20.995
that you are not holy, you are not a saint.

187
00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:23.955
You cannot get caught up in the lie.

188
00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:28.275
The Bible says you are positionally before God.

189
00:11:29.345 --> 00:11:32.555
Holy you are washed, clean,

190
00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:34.435
acceptable before God.

191
00:11:34.845 --> 00:11:36.315
Don't let the enemy lie to you.

192
00:11:38.035 --> 00:11:42.955
Remember this truth, you are a saint by faith in Christ.

193
00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:46.885
But we come back to Romans 1213.

194
00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:50.765
What this means then is if we are to contribute to the needs

195
00:11:50.765 --> 00:11:53.800
of the saints, that's referring to all followers of Christ,

196
00:11:54.095 --> 00:11:57.805
contribute to the needs of every believer that we can.

197
00:12:00.195 --> 00:12:01.735
Now we're assuming a couple things here.

198
00:12:01.745 --> 00:12:03.175
Jesus did say that we are

199
00:12:03.175 --> 00:12:05.215
to make sure our families are taken care of first.

200
00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:07.815
That's a a minimum standard.

201
00:12:07.835 --> 00:12:10.175
We don't need to make sure they're abundance, but,

202
00:12:10.175 --> 00:12:12.335
but that they're taken care of, that they're provided for.

203
00:12:12.595 --> 00:12:15.455
And Paul said if someone doesn't work, they shouldn't eat.

204
00:12:15.595 --> 00:12:16.735
So if someone's able to work

205
00:12:16.755 --> 00:12:18.055
and they're not, that's a problem.

206
00:12:19.075 --> 00:12:20.895
So we're assuming those things,

207
00:12:21.195 --> 00:12:25.695
but there will be times when Christians have genuine needs.

208
00:12:27.235 --> 00:12:28.535
And so we are to care for them.

209
00:12:28.795 --> 00:12:31.775
We are to contribute to those needs.

210
00:12:32.935 --> 00:12:35.575
I i love the picture that Second Corinthians paints of this.

211
00:12:36.805 --> 00:12:40.415
This is the apostle Paul, uh, in, in these two chapters,

212
00:12:40.415 --> 00:12:41.495
second Corinthians eight and nine.

213
00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:42.895
I'll encourage you to go read those later

214
00:12:43.225 --> 00:12:44.735
today, the full part of that.

215
00:12:44.795 --> 00:12:46.175
But in these chapters,

216
00:12:46.175 --> 00:12:48.135
what he's doing is he's encouraging these

217
00:12:48.645 --> 00:12:51.375
believers in all these churches around Asia.

218
00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:54.015
He's saying, Hey, I'm, I'm collecting money

219
00:12:54.395 --> 00:12:57.255
for the saints in Jerusalem who are really poor,

220
00:12:57.925 --> 00:12:59.575
like extremely impoverished.

221
00:12:59.575 --> 00:13:01.255
They really were about to die.

222
00:13:01.255 --> 00:13:02.815
And so he's collecting money to try

223
00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:04.335
to support them in Jerusalem.

224
00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:10.325
Yet here's the thing, the churches, he's asking for help.

225
00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:15.235
It's not like they were wealthy, they were poor too.

226
00:13:16.885 --> 00:13:20.585
And yet these churches all over gave willingly

227
00:13:20.585 --> 00:13:23.265
and abundantly to help those in need.

228
00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:27.365
And it was about their hearts as they gave,

229
00:13:28.105 --> 00:13:29.405
not about how much they could give.

230
00:13:29.425 --> 00:13:31.765
It was about their hearts as they did it.

231
00:13:31.765 --> 00:13:33.365
Because here's the thing, it could have been really

232
00:13:33.365 --> 00:13:37.045
discouraging for someone who was only able

233
00:13:37.045 --> 00:13:38.325
to give a couple pennies.

234
00:13:40.175 --> 00:13:41.255
'cause there were wealthy Christians

235
00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:42.815
that probably in those cities were like

236
00:13:42.815 --> 00:13:43.855
able to give a lot more.

237
00:13:43.995 --> 00:13:46.015
And they were just say, Hey man, take this to Jerusalem.

238
00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:47.655
I I wanna love them, care for them.

239
00:13:47.835 --> 00:13:50.415
And then this person over here can give two pennies and,

240
00:13:50.415 --> 00:13:53.095
and you would think that would be discouraging to them.

241
00:13:53.155 --> 00:13:57.135
But listen to two Corinthians eight verses 13 through 15,

242
00:13:57.235 --> 00:13:58.375
how Paul addresses that.

243
00:13:59.555 --> 00:14:02.335
He says, for I do not mean that others should be eased

244
00:14:02.335 --> 00:14:05.815
and you burdened meaning you give more than you can.

245
00:14:06.355 --> 00:14:07.775
And he's not asking you to do that.

246
00:14:10.275 --> 00:14:12.885
He's saying as a matter of fairness,

247
00:14:13.475 --> 00:14:16.565
your abundance at the present time should supply their need

248
00:14:16.745 --> 00:14:19.285
so that their abundance may supply your need.

249
00:14:19.355 --> 00:14:21.885
That there may be fairness as it is written.

250
00:14:21.885 --> 00:14:23.885
Whoever gathered much had nothing left over.

251
00:14:23.955 --> 00:14:26.405
Whoever gathered little had no lack.

252
00:14:26.515 --> 00:14:29.245
He's talking about in Exodus the wilderness.

253
00:14:30.445 --> 00:14:32.525
Whenever they were gathering the manna, it didn't matter

254
00:14:32.525 --> 00:14:34.805
how much one gathered didn't gather in more

255
00:14:34.805 --> 00:14:36.525
or less, they all ended up with the same.

256
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:40.245
It all evened out in the end. That's what he's saying here.

257
00:14:42.005 --> 00:14:44.375
Some might have more now can give more now,

258
00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:47.255
but other people might have more later can give more later.

259
00:14:47.315 --> 00:14:49.775
And then at some point it's gonna be the other way around

260
00:14:49.775 --> 00:14:52.245
that you have nothing and you need something from them.

261
00:14:52.385 --> 00:14:54.165
That's the point he's making.

262
00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:58.765
'cause the truth is that Christians are not immune

263
00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.085
to financial struggle.

264
00:15:01.535 --> 00:15:03.785
Just because you're a believer doesn't mean you won't go

265
00:15:03.785 --> 00:15:05.905
through illness or hardship or anything like that.

266
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.345
Even really faithful Christians.

267
00:15:07.355 --> 00:15:08.745
We're not saying here that just

268
00:15:08.745 --> 00:15:10.345
because you're a believer you're gonna be wealthy.

269
00:15:12.655 --> 00:15:15.915
Look at the early church, we look at them

270
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.195
as like they're the standards.

271
00:15:17.265 --> 00:15:20.155
They were faithful. They were following Jesus as close

272
00:15:20.155 --> 00:15:22.955
as you can and they were poor and persecuted.

273
00:15:25.305 --> 00:15:28.565
The apostle Paul, as he goes in obedience on the mission

274
00:15:28.615 --> 00:15:29.965
trips, God sent him.

275
00:15:30.385 --> 00:15:33.765
He needed support from believers in order to make it happen.

276
00:15:37.215 --> 00:15:38.635
So just because you have a lot now

277
00:15:40.605 --> 00:15:42.015
doesn't mean you'll have a lot later.

278
00:15:43.205 --> 00:15:46.255
There's no guarantee if you're trusting, listen, this is

279
00:15:46.275 --> 00:15:47.455
so easy to do in our culture.

280
00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:50.975
If you're trusting in a retirement plan or a savings account

281
00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:52.735
or whatever it is, something

282
00:15:52.735 --> 00:15:55.655
that you're trusting in other than the Lord

283
00:15:55.915 --> 00:15:59.735
for your financial security, man that is a fickle foundation

284
00:16:01.775 --> 00:16:06.625
because it can change like that and it can all go away.

285
00:16:07.505 --> 00:16:08.965
And then where's your foundation?

286
00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.445
This must be our foundation.

287
00:16:11.465 --> 00:16:13.285
Our hope is in Christ our eternity.

288
00:16:13.285 --> 00:16:15.125
Our security is in Christ.

289
00:16:16.105 --> 00:16:19.725
And we might need, each of us might at some point need

290
00:16:20.435 --> 00:16:21.885
even financially from others.

291
00:16:24.105 --> 00:16:26.725
And so like Jesus did, we can

292
00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:30.885
and should go about caring for people's physical needs.

293
00:16:31.715 --> 00:16:34.725
Like Jesus fed the hungry, clothed, the naked.

294
00:16:35.025 --> 00:16:39.725
He, he cared for the whole person. We should as well.

295
00:16:43.005 --> 00:16:44.905
But let's just take this one step further.

296
00:16:45.805 --> 00:16:48.945
If we broaden this out beyond just giving money,

297
00:16:49.015 --> 00:16:53.375
just giving resources, there are

298
00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.295
infinite needs all around us.

299
00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:59.085
If we start doing that, If we start to say, well,

300
00:16:59.085 --> 00:17:00.965
it's not just only about giving money, that's part of it.

301
00:17:01.105 --> 00:17:02.725
But but what if? What if it's more?

302
00:17:02.785 --> 00:17:05.925
And we as the body of Christ can meet those needs whether

303
00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:10.445
it's relational connection for the lonely or

304
00:17:10.445 --> 00:17:13.205
or whether it's emotional support for the hurting

305
00:17:15.895 --> 00:17:17.575
spiritual leadership for those who are hopeless.

306
00:17:18.265 --> 00:17:20.215
Mercy for those who feel outcast.

307
00:17:20.435 --> 00:17:23.495
If we can see those needs as important too,

308
00:17:23.755 --> 00:17:27.895
we can meet those as we look to give our lives

309
00:17:30.135 --> 00:17:34.235
and, and listen, if I begin to see every believer

310
00:17:34.735 --> 00:17:39.695
as a fellow saint, It shifts the giving

311
00:17:40.245 --> 00:17:43.255
from superiority to inferiority, that kind of thing.

312
00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:45.255
That dynamic of like, I'm gonna give you a handout

313
00:17:45.275 --> 00:17:47.535
and I'm gonna help you try to come up to my level.

314
00:17:47.795 --> 00:17:49.325
It shifts it away from that, that

315
00:17:49.505 --> 00:17:52.445
and it starts to say, no, no, this is saint to saint.

316
00:17:53.435 --> 00:17:55.685
This is family member to family member.

317
00:17:55.915 --> 00:17:57.725
This is equal to equal.

318
00:17:57.855 --> 00:18:00.525
We're just sharing as the family of God.

319
00:18:02.035 --> 00:18:04.735
No one's better, no one's worse, none of that. It's equal.

320
00:18:04.915 --> 00:18:08.295
We are all just saints together.

321
00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:14.825
It changes the dynamic. Which

322
00:18:14.825 --> 00:18:19.505
leads us to our second point today that giving

323
00:18:19.695 --> 00:18:22.865
that we're talking about engages true Christian fellowship.

324
00:18:24.955 --> 00:18:29.615
It is what facilitates, engages true Christian fellowship.

325
00:18:31.315 --> 00:18:34.295
So look again at that first word in Romans 1213,

326
00:18:35.605 --> 00:18:36.975
it's the word contribute.

327
00:18:39.005 --> 00:18:41.145
Now, in the original language this was written in,

328
00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:42.505
it's the word coin.

329
00:18:45.105 --> 00:18:47.485
If you've been in church any length of time,

330
00:18:48.225 --> 00:18:50.565
you probably recognize that word as similar

331
00:18:50.705 --> 00:18:55.165
to the word koinonia, which means fellowship.

332
00:18:55.265 --> 00:18:58.165
It means sharing. It means participation.

333
00:19:00.395 --> 00:19:02.015
Now if you grew up in church, how many

334
00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:04.575
of you had a fellowship hall in the church building

335
00:19:04.575 --> 00:19:05.575
that you grew up going to?

336
00:19:05.575 --> 00:19:09.095
Right? Anybody? Yeah, Uhhuh kinda look like this probably.

337
00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:13.575
And what did we do in the fellowship hall?

338
00:19:15.285 --> 00:19:17.775
Just ate food. That's all we did. That's it.

339
00:19:18.155 --> 00:19:20.575
We would have, we would have fellowship meals

340
00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:23.055
in the fellowship hall.

341
00:19:24.475 --> 00:19:25.975
Now, I'm not saying that's wrong

342
00:19:26.855 --> 00:19:29.625
because think about as you're eating a meal around a table,

343
00:19:29.625 --> 00:19:31.305
you're sharing a meal, right?

344
00:19:31.365 --> 00:19:32.665
So there's a sense of that.

345
00:19:32.765 --> 00:19:37.185
But this word koinonia has so much more to it.

346
00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:43.095
It's not just like handouts, charity giving money,

347
00:19:43.275 --> 00:19:45.615
it carries with it the idea of family.

348
00:19:47.295 --> 00:19:48.865
There's a connection here

349
00:19:49.035 --> 00:19:53.185
where you are entering into the struggle with those

350
00:19:53.205 --> 00:19:54.545
who need something in the moment.

351
00:19:55.035 --> 00:19:58.185
Contribute Nia to those who are in need.

352
00:19:58.205 --> 00:19:59.505
You're entering into it,

353
00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:03.785
it's participating in each other's lives that yes,

354
00:20:03.795 --> 00:20:05.705
we're giving to meet those needs,

355
00:20:05.765 --> 00:20:07.585
but really that's just an indication

356
00:20:07.615 --> 00:20:09.705
that something deeper is happening.

357
00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:11.145
That our hearts are connected,

358
00:20:11.175 --> 00:20:13.625
that we're actually walking in life together.

359
00:20:13.885 --> 00:20:16.065
And I'm just gonna give to this need that you have

360
00:20:18.585 --> 00:20:20.525
that's contributing.

361
00:20:20.545 --> 00:20:21.645
That's fellowship.

362
00:20:25.025 --> 00:20:27.525
Now this is my full-time vocation

363
00:20:27.585 --> 00:20:32.415
and so I get time to study the landscape

364
00:20:33.275 --> 00:20:37.135
of the church in America, read study, podcasts,

365
00:20:37.135 --> 00:20:38.535
other things, just kinda look around and

366
00:20:38.535 --> 00:20:41.535
and kind of identify what's going on.

367
00:20:42.755 --> 00:20:45.815
And so when I look at things like this fellowship,

368
00:20:46.135 --> 00:20:49.245
I see pockets it happening here.

369
00:20:49.455 --> 00:20:52.485
Other churches, I see things like this going on

370
00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:54.165
and I praise God for that.

371
00:20:57.125 --> 00:21:02.105
But overall, churches in

372
00:21:02.105 --> 00:21:03.705
America I think have missed it.

373
00:21:06.125 --> 00:21:08.375
That we've lowered the standard.

374
00:21:11.985 --> 00:21:13.845
See, if we're talking about fellowship like this,

375
00:21:14.825 --> 00:21:18.765
if we're talking about true koinonia participation in life,

376
00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:22.805
sharing needs, really living this out together,

377
00:21:23.745 --> 00:21:26.005
if we're looking at what this is getting to

378
00:21:30.015 --> 00:21:33.555
That is so much more than just

379
00:21:34.175 --> 00:21:37.355
coming into a room for an hour every two

380
00:21:37.415 --> 00:21:39.635
or three weeks sitting in rows

381
00:21:40.195 --> 00:21:41.675
watching something happen and going home.

382
00:21:44.675 --> 00:21:47.265
Right? This, this is, this is so much more than that.

383
00:21:48.635 --> 00:21:50.045
There's so much more here.

384
00:21:50.165 --> 00:21:53.805
What this word contribute was getting at it means true

385
00:21:53.805 --> 00:21:55.965
fellowship is that your needs are my needs.

386
00:21:56.195 --> 00:21:59.285
Your burdens are my burdens. My burdens are your burdens.

387
00:21:59.305 --> 00:22:00.525
And we're sharing this together

388
00:22:00.665 --> 00:22:03.085
and we're actually living out this life.

389
00:22:03.195 --> 00:22:05.125
It's not just coming in and being consumers.

390
00:22:05.235 --> 00:22:08.245
It's an investor in other people's lives

391
00:22:11.645 --> 00:22:14.615
that when we contribute to needs like this, we are truly

392
00:22:15.365 --> 00:22:16.735
devoted to one another.

393
00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:20.255
We are actually creating bonds that

394
00:22:20.775 --> 00:22:23.335
transcend every worldly barrier that the the

395
00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:24.935
around us tries to put on us.

396
00:22:27.745 --> 00:22:30.275
Like it shouldn't matter if you are

397
00:22:32.155 --> 00:22:35.395
socially different or economically different

398
00:22:36.595 --> 00:22:37.855
or ethnically different.

399
00:22:39.935 --> 00:22:42.925
If you are a saint, your family,

400
00:22:45.375 --> 00:22:48.315
if you're a saint by faith in Christ, you are family.

401
00:22:48.375 --> 00:22:50.795
And here this, this is a little extreme to hear,

402
00:22:51.055 --> 00:22:54.435
but if you are a saint, if we are family, that means you

403
00:22:54.435 --> 00:22:57.675
and I or those Afghan believers, we are closer

404
00:22:58.475 --> 00:23:01.195
together than you are with your unbelieving mom.

405
00:23:03.375 --> 00:23:06.555
We are more connected than you are with your

406
00:23:07.075 --> 00:23:08.155
unbelieving sister.

407
00:23:11.175 --> 00:23:15.595
The blood of Christ flows deeper than biological blood

408
00:23:16.185 --> 00:23:17.875
because we'll be with each other forever.

409
00:23:19.415 --> 00:23:21.555
And the Holy Spirit unites us together.

410
00:23:21.555 --> 00:23:23.675
That's this idea of fellowship

411
00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:25.675
and the early church is a great picture of this.

412
00:23:28.505 --> 00:23:29.915
Like we love Acts two.

413
00:23:29.935 --> 00:23:31.955
We love how they lived out their faith,

414
00:23:32.025 --> 00:23:35.035
this new radical way, powerful testimony to the gospel.

415
00:23:35.455 --> 00:23:38.755
But what made it so compelling in part was

416
00:23:38.855 --> 00:23:40.955
how different they were from each other.

417
00:23:41.735 --> 00:23:42.915
And yet that was still happening

418
00:23:43.545 --> 00:23:46.955
Because Remember the Pentecost is

419
00:23:46.955 --> 00:23:48.635
where the church was birthed.

420
00:23:48.865 --> 00:23:49.955
That was a feast

421
00:23:50.105 --> 00:23:53.195
that people from all over the world had been brought

422
00:23:53.255 --> 00:23:55.035
to Jerusalem to celebrate this

423
00:23:55.055 --> 00:23:57.275
as the Jewish calendar dictated.

424
00:23:57.275 --> 00:23:58.315
And so they were all there

425
00:23:58.415 --> 00:24:00.475
and people from all kinds of

426
00:24:00.995 --> 00:24:03.315
nationalities heard the gospel from Peter

427
00:24:03.535 --> 00:24:07.615
and believed people

428
00:24:07.675 --> 00:24:09.615
who may have been opposed to each other

429
00:24:10.035 --> 00:24:14.655
before, were now living out things like Acts 2 44

430
00:24:14.655 --> 00:24:18.455
through 47 that all who believed were together

431
00:24:19.155 --> 00:24:20.655
and had all things in common

432
00:24:21.475 --> 00:24:23.895
and they were selling their possessions and belongings

433
00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:27.335
and distributing the proceeds to all as any had need.

434
00:24:29.245 --> 00:24:31.105
And day by day attending the temple together,

435
00:24:31.465 --> 00:24:33.465
breaking bread in their homes, they received their food

436
00:24:33.465 --> 00:24:36.305
with glad, generous hearts, praising God,

437
00:24:36.305 --> 00:24:37.705
having favor with all the people.

438
00:24:37.885 --> 00:24:39.585
And the Lord added to their number day

439
00:24:39.585 --> 00:24:41.145
by day those who were being saved.

440
00:24:42.255 --> 00:24:44.185
Like that's true Christian fellowship.

441
00:24:47.305 --> 00:24:49.435
They weren't unified merely

442
00:24:49.435 --> 00:24:53.915
because they had the same economic class or

443
00:24:53.915 --> 00:24:56.675
because they had similar habits in their lives or

444
00:24:56.675 --> 00:24:58.235
because they were the same political party.

445
00:24:58.495 --> 00:24:59.835
It was way bigger than that.

446
00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:04.235
They were what Romans 12, five calls members one of another.

447
00:25:07.895 --> 00:25:10.475
Why? Because of the gospel of Jesus Christ alone.

448
00:25:11.025 --> 00:25:13.595
Because Jesus had changed their lives.

449
00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:15.235
The Holy Spirit had filled them

450
00:25:15.375 --> 00:25:19.235
and so they then contributed to one another in that pursuit

451
00:25:19.865 --> 00:25:20.955
financially of course,

452
00:25:21.255 --> 00:25:24.035
but then with time, with talent, with effort,

453
00:25:24.035 --> 00:25:26.795
with resources, with skill, all of those things

454
00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:29.475
that God had given them, they said, Hey, I'm gonna give this

455
00:25:29.475 --> 00:25:31.435
to you as anyone has needs.

456
00:25:31.735 --> 00:25:35.905
I'm gonna give it all. That's how we got

457
00:25:35.965 --> 00:25:40.265
to our new value a few years ago of reimagined generosity.

458
00:25:41.255 --> 00:25:45.185
This is a, a church value that that we see from this kind

459
00:25:45.185 --> 00:25:49.505
of idea is that it is our privilege to get to use

460
00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:54.505
what God has entrusted to each one of us, all

461
00:25:54.505 --> 00:25:57.025
of these other things, to join him in

462
00:25:57.025 --> 00:25:58.225
the care for his people.

463
00:25:59.955 --> 00:26:02.455
You know, he uses us to care for his people.

464
00:26:02.955 --> 00:26:06.375
He uses us to advance his kingdom in the world. He uses us.

465
00:26:06.445 --> 00:26:09.255
What a privilege, what a gift that is to us that he gets

466
00:26:09.255 --> 00:26:10.535
to do that through us.

467
00:26:10.845 --> 00:26:11.855
Like what a gift.

468
00:26:14.915 --> 00:26:16.315
Reimagining our generosity.

469
00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:21.505
It's what first Timothy six teaches us,

470
00:26:23.095 --> 00:26:26.945
Says, as for the rich in this present age, which by the way,

471
00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:28.505
no matter how much you have

472
00:26:28.505 --> 00:26:30.985
or don't have here in America, comparatively to the rest

473
00:26:30.985 --> 00:26:32.425
of the world, we are rich.

474
00:26:34.375 --> 00:26:38.835
So as for the rich in this present age, charge them not

475
00:26:38.835 --> 00:26:40.555
to be haughty, prideful

476
00:26:41.455 --> 00:26:44.310
nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,

477
00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:48.425
but to set their hopes on God, who richly provides us

478
00:26:48.425 --> 00:26:49.745
with everything to enjoy.

479
00:26:50.655 --> 00:26:53.505
They are to do good, to be rich in good works,

480
00:26:53.885 --> 00:26:55.945
to be generous and ready to share.

481
00:26:57.095 --> 00:26:59.745
Thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation

482
00:26:59.745 --> 00:27:02.105
for the future so that they may take hold of

483
00:27:02.105 --> 00:27:03.945
that which is truly life.

484
00:27:05.515 --> 00:27:08.725
Truly life. See, we're talking about giving.

485
00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:10.205
It's not an obligation.

486
00:27:12.205 --> 00:27:13.825
Giving is an opportunity

487
00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:18.605
to participate in God's work in the world.

488
00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:21.745
We Don't have to.

489
00:27:22.645 --> 00:27:26.515
We get to, and that is what

490
00:27:27.795 --> 00:27:30.675
encourages fellowship in the deepest sense of the word

491
00:27:30.775 --> 00:27:34.795
as we contribute to the needs of the saints.

492
00:27:37.885 --> 00:27:41.535
Here's the thing though, it's not in our nature

493
00:27:41.755 --> 00:27:43.055
to give, right?

494
00:27:44.775 --> 00:27:48.865
We are naturally selfish people. We wanna hoard.

495
00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:51.385
We want more and better stuff.

496
00:27:51.845 --> 00:27:54.025
We wanna feel secure like I'm safe.

497
00:27:54.445 --> 00:27:58.865
We want, we are selfish at our sinful nature.

498
00:28:01.915 --> 00:28:03.495
That's why if we wanna get to that kind

499
00:28:03.495 --> 00:28:05.735
of reimagined generosity, we have

500
00:28:05.735 --> 00:28:08.735
to have a motivation better than guilt

501
00:28:10.875 --> 00:28:12.365
because I could guilt trip you.

502
00:28:12.545 --> 00:28:13.565
We could guilt trip you.

503
00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:15.605
All of that could happen and it's gonna

504
00:28:15.605 --> 00:28:16.805
last for a little bit.

505
00:28:17.065 --> 00:28:21.405
But the true motivation of this kind of generosity is

506
00:28:21.405 --> 00:28:22.485
what our third point says.

507
00:28:22.825 --> 00:28:27.085
We give because of how God gives to us,

508
00:28:29.485 --> 00:28:31.105
that's the motivation that will last.

509
00:28:33.205 --> 00:28:34.425
We are generous people

510
00:28:34.735 --> 00:28:36.945
because of

511
00:28:37.005 --> 00:28:40.225
how generous our God is to us.

512
00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:47.325
This command to contribute to the needs of the saints,

513
00:28:47.745 --> 00:28:50.845
it flows from gospel grace.

514
00:28:54.805 --> 00:28:57.945
See, we don't give to earn God's favor.

515
00:28:59.365 --> 00:29:01.265
We already have God's favor in Christ.

516
00:29:03.465 --> 00:29:07.365
We don't give to become saints in some way and

517
00:29:07.385 --> 00:29:09.125
and do the works we give

518
00:29:09.315 --> 00:29:11.805
because we already are saints in Christ

519
00:29:12.545 --> 00:29:15.565
and we are filled with a generous God who gives us

520
00:29:16.075 --> 00:29:17.285
what we can give to others.

521
00:29:19.545 --> 00:29:22.515
It's giving out of the overflow of gratitude.

522
00:29:22.705 --> 00:29:25.915
It's not trying to give more to try to overcome your guilt.

523
00:29:25.985 --> 00:29:28.715
Like, man, I I, I really blew it again, I need to give more.

524
00:29:28.865 --> 00:29:31.075
Like that's, that's wrong. That's not gospel.

525
00:29:32.825 --> 00:29:36.835
This is giving in response to all that God has given us

526
00:29:37.415 --> 00:29:40.025
in Christ And in the world.

527
00:29:43.755 --> 00:29:45.895
Here's where we go back to two Corinthians eight

528
00:29:45.995 --> 00:29:48.215
for some help in understanding this.

529
00:29:49.545 --> 00:29:51.575
Again, remember, Paul's urging these believers

530
00:29:51.595 --> 00:29:53.135
to give sacrificially.

531
00:29:53.195 --> 00:29:57.255
He says this is his motivation two Corinthians eight, nine

532
00:29:57.755 --> 00:30:01.015
for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,

533
00:30:01.325 --> 00:30:05.335
that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor

534
00:30:06.275 --> 00:30:09.535
so that you by his poverty might become rich.

535
00:30:11.275 --> 00:30:12.455
That's the gospel, right?

536
00:30:13.995 --> 00:30:18.335
He says Jesus had the richest of heaven,

537
00:30:18.335 --> 00:30:19.335
everything about it,

538
00:30:19.395 --> 00:30:24.055
and yet he set that aside to become poor like us so

539
00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:27.655
that you and I could be rich with him forever.

540
00:30:29.165 --> 00:30:30.815
Like that's how much he treasures you.

541
00:30:30.985 --> 00:30:33.895
Don't forget this church like he treasures you that much

542
00:30:33.995 --> 00:30:35.455
to say, I'm gonna set that aside

543
00:30:35.555 --> 00:30:39.335
and I'm gonna go to live in the dust so I can be with them,

544
00:30:39.685 --> 00:30:42.455
live for them, die for them, resurrect for them

545
00:30:42.755 --> 00:30:44.375
and then they can be with me forever.

546
00:30:45.795 --> 00:30:49.785
He did that for you. That's his love for you.

547
00:30:50.785 --> 00:30:53.405
That's his treasuring of you.

548
00:30:53.535 --> 00:30:57.525
Which then makes our giving in response fueled by

549
00:30:57.915 --> 00:31:01.565
that gospel, which makes our giving then can be cheerful.

550
00:31:01.705 --> 00:31:03.205
If that's what God had did for us,

551
00:31:03.395 --> 00:31:05.285
then I can just cheerfully give

552
00:31:05.285 --> 00:31:07.925
because of what he's done cheerfully for me.

553
00:31:08.035 --> 00:31:11.365
When I give, I get to participate in what God did for me.

554
00:31:11.585 --> 00:31:13.645
He gave cheerfully joyfully to me.

555
00:31:13.845 --> 00:31:15.285
I get to experience a piece of that

556
00:31:15.385 --> 00:31:17.805
as I give away to others.

557
00:31:21.655 --> 00:31:25.555
See, when we think this way, that's

558
00:31:25.555 --> 00:31:29.115
what makes it become less about percentages and minimums

559
00:31:29.415 --> 00:31:31.475
and should it be gross or net, all these things.

560
00:31:31.735 --> 00:31:33.435
It takes that conversation away

561
00:31:33.615 --> 00:31:38.395
and it just means man, I get to share what God has

562
00:31:39.075 --> 00:31:40.715
entrusted to me to steward.

563
00:31:40.825 --> 00:31:42.355
Just get to share it. It doesn't matter

564
00:31:42.625 --> 00:31:45.235
what I'm doing numbers wise, it's just like,

565
00:31:45.235 --> 00:31:46.675
man, God gave me everything.

566
00:31:46.855 --> 00:31:48.355
Here's, here's what I can give away.

567
00:31:50.005 --> 00:31:53.425
It changes the conversation away from legalistic numbers

568
00:31:53.605 --> 00:31:56.265
to just sharing

569
00:31:57.135 --> 00:31:59.625
because God joyfully shared with us

570
00:32:02.325 --> 00:32:03.665
and lemme be clear about something.

571
00:32:04.915 --> 00:32:09.385
Everything I've talked about today has nothing to do

572
00:32:09.655 --> 00:32:11.225
with how much money you have.

573
00:32:13.465 --> 00:32:15.315
This is not just a conversation for those who are wealthy.

574
00:32:16.605 --> 00:32:20.625
Everything about this, it's not about your abundance,

575
00:32:21.695 --> 00:32:23.545
it's about God's abundance through you.

576
00:32:24.645 --> 00:32:26.945
He owns the cattle on a thousand hills. He owns everything.

577
00:32:27.095 --> 00:32:30.585
It's all his. Anyway, it's his abundance through you.

578
00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:35.505
Just listen to this picture of of cheerful giver.

579
00:32:35.505 --> 00:32:38.545
Again, Paul in second Corinthians was talking to people

580
00:32:38.645 --> 00:32:43.045
who were poor and he's saying, give, give generously.

581
00:32:43.045 --> 00:32:44.245
Listen to what he says.

582
00:32:44.435 --> 00:32:46.685
This is Ians nine verses six through 15.

583
00:32:46.905 --> 00:32:48.005
He says, the point is this,

584
00:32:49.435 --> 00:32:52.085
whoever sow sparingly will also reap sparingly.

585
00:32:52.085 --> 00:32:54.325
Whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.

586
00:32:54.515 --> 00:32:58.085
Each one must give as he has decided in his heart,

587
00:32:59.305 --> 00:33:01.405
not reluctantly, not under compulsion.

588
00:33:02.105 --> 00:33:03.645
For God loves a cheerful giver

589
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:08.005
and God is able to make all grace abound to you so

590
00:33:08.005 --> 00:33:09.205
that having all sufficiency

591
00:33:09.205 --> 00:33:11.845
and all things at all times you may abound in every good

592
00:33:11.845 --> 00:33:14.885
work as it is written, he's distributed freely.

593
00:33:14.995 --> 00:33:17.845
He's given to the poor. His righteousness endures forever.

594
00:33:17.955 --> 00:33:20.845
Meaning he's given all of this to you. Watch this.

595
00:33:21.025 --> 00:33:24.765
He who supplies seed to the sower bread for food will supply

596
00:33:25.025 --> 00:33:27.445
and multiply your seed for sowing

597
00:33:27.545 --> 00:33:30.405
and increase the harvest of your righteousness.

598
00:33:30.705 --> 00:33:33.845
You will be enriched in every way, to be generous,

599
00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:35.605
in every way, which

600
00:33:35.765 --> 00:33:38.565
through us will produce thanksgiving to God.

601
00:33:40.285 --> 00:33:41.515
Watch this. The ministry

602
00:33:41.515 --> 00:33:43.635
of this servant is not only supplying the needs

603
00:33:43.635 --> 00:33:45.595
of the saints but is also overflowing in many

604
00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:46.875
Thanksgivings to God.

605
00:33:47.295 --> 00:33:49.355
By their approval of this service, they,

606
00:33:49.575 --> 00:33:51.155
the world will glorify God

607
00:33:51.155 --> 00:33:53.755
because of your submission that comes from your confession,

608
00:33:53.755 --> 00:33:55.235
the gospel of Jesus Christ

609
00:33:55.535 --> 00:33:57.395
and the generosity of your contribution for them

610
00:33:57.655 --> 00:33:59.555
and for all the others while they long for you

611
00:33:59.555 --> 00:34:01.555
and pray for you because the surpassing grace

612
00:34:01.695 --> 00:34:04.395
of God upon you, thanks be to God

613
00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:06.675
for his inexpressible gift.

614
00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:11.595
That is what the supernatural grace of God does in a heart.

615
00:34:12.895 --> 00:34:17.715
It changes us from selfish motivations to

616
00:34:18.685 --> 00:34:23.435
fruit of generosity that my life orients

617
00:34:23.945 --> 00:34:25.235
away not to me.

618
00:34:25.415 --> 00:34:28.675
It orients to others as I submit to the Lord,

619
00:34:28.735 --> 00:34:30.835
as I trust the Lord with my future,

620
00:34:31.345 --> 00:34:33.515
with his whatever I got this month.

621
00:34:33.515 --> 00:34:35.955
Like, God, there's more month at the end of the paycheck,

622
00:34:36.055 --> 00:34:37.075
but I'm gonna trust you.

623
00:34:37.255 --> 00:34:38.315
I'm gonna be generous

624
00:34:38.515 --> 00:34:40.435
'cause I know in this moment you're calling me to do that

625
00:34:40.495 --> 00:34:42.395
and I'm gonna give to this person who's in need.

626
00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:46.595
And you just say, gotta trust you. Watch what he does.

627
00:34:47.645 --> 00:34:50.865
He works through you to provide for his people to

628
00:34:51.555 --> 00:34:54.185
maybe even increase your ability to do that.

629
00:34:56.505 --> 00:35:00.845
And it's all for his glory to spread through the world.

630
00:35:02.675 --> 00:35:06.775
You remember what Jesus said, John 1335, he says, by this,

631
00:35:07.115 --> 00:35:09.055
all people will know that you are my disciples.

632
00:35:09.355 --> 00:35:12.615
If you have love for one another,

633
00:35:15.045 --> 00:35:16.895
that doesn't mean affectionate

634
00:35:16.895 --> 00:35:18.335
thoughts towards someone else.

635
00:35:18.605 --> 00:35:23.015
That means genuine, sacrificial, generous love

636
00:35:23.515 --> 00:35:26.135
for someone else where I'm entered into life with you.

637
00:35:26.195 --> 00:35:28.895
I'm actually caring for you, supporting you when you need it

638
00:35:28.915 --> 00:35:30.135
and you're doing the same for me.

639
00:35:30.445 --> 00:35:32.095
That is the love he's talking about

640
00:35:33.515 --> 00:35:36.375
and that is the love that the world has not seen very well

641
00:35:36.595 --> 00:35:38.285
in churches in America.

642
00:35:41.875 --> 00:35:44.255
Now, I'm thankful that

643
00:35:44.255 --> 00:35:46.095
so many in our church give faithfully.

644
00:35:46.675 --> 00:35:48.935
We have a benevolence fund that is overflowing.

645
00:35:48.935 --> 00:35:50.815
That's how we care for people who are in need.

646
00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:53.135
If you need that, don't feel ashamed to come ask for that.

647
00:35:53.195 --> 00:35:54.895
We want to help as best we can.

648
00:35:55.155 --> 00:35:56.775
We can't help everybody in the same

649
00:35:56.775 --> 00:35:57.935
way, but we want to help.

650
00:35:58.795 --> 00:36:00.775
We have money in that.

651
00:36:00.805 --> 00:36:04.575
That is from giving people in our church.

652
00:36:04.835 --> 00:36:07.495
We have ministries that are serving, caring

653
00:36:07.495 --> 00:36:08.695
for people all over the place.

654
00:36:08.835 --> 00:36:10.655
We have disciples being made. We're gonna camps.

655
00:36:10.655 --> 00:36:11.815
We're doing all these things. VBS.

656
00:36:11.835 --> 00:36:16.115
Now, people are being cared for through the fruit

657
00:36:16.175 --> 00:36:19.995
of people generously giving through the church.

658
00:36:20.335 --> 00:36:23.435
And we're blessed that we get to begin giving more away

659
00:36:23.895 --> 00:36:28.315
to kingdom causes elsewhere as you and I give more.

660
00:36:32.145 --> 00:36:33.285
But here's the reality.

661
00:36:33.355 --> 00:36:37.075
Each of our hearts still needs some realignment.

662
00:36:39.315 --> 00:36:42.955
'cause if we're honest, none of us are fully Christlike, yet

663
00:36:46.375 --> 00:36:48.195
we still face the temptation to

664
00:36:50.275 --> 00:36:52.995
treasure things in the world more than we treasure Christ.

665
00:36:54.935 --> 00:36:59.255
We still face the temptation at times where we're not

666
00:36:59.255 --> 00:37:01.135
as generous as we could be.

667
00:37:05.025 --> 00:37:09.205
And so that's why over the last few months we have talked

668
00:37:09.215 --> 00:37:13.725
about our focus being on delighting in Christ

669
00:37:15.575 --> 00:37:17.425
Because guilt won't get us there.

670
00:37:19.305 --> 00:37:21.785
Motivational speeches won't get us there.

671
00:37:22.085 --> 00:37:25.785
Our focus has to be on Jesus

672
00:37:26.125 --> 00:37:28.145
and what he has done for us.

673
00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:31.345
That's the only way our hearts will actually change,

674
00:37:31.525 --> 00:37:33.905
and that's the only way then the flow

675
00:37:33.925 --> 00:37:36.545
of generosity will support the needs of the saints

676
00:37:36.565 --> 00:37:38.785
around us, and that's the only way the world

677
00:37:38.805 --> 00:37:39.985
around us will see

678
00:37:39.985 --> 00:37:42.425
that our faith is not just about ourselves,

679
00:37:44.545 --> 00:37:46.725
but it's about I care for you and I care for you

680
00:37:46.745 --> 00:37:49.285
and you care for me, and we are a body together

681
00:37:49.585 --> 00:37:53.805
as a community that starts by treasuring Christ more.

682
00:37:55.935 --> 00:37:57.995
So I invite you to pray with me towards that end right now,

683
00:38:02.845 --> 00:38:05.755
again, I don't know your situation, where you are,

684
00:38:05.815 --> 00:38:07.235
what's going on in your heart,

685
00:38:07.235 --> 00:38:10.035
what the Holy Spirit was impressing on you, but,

686
00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:11.875
but I just want us to stop

687
00:38:11.875 --> 00:38:16.195
and examine our hearts right now to just see

688
00:38:16.195 --> 00:38:17.755
what we have been treasuring.

689
00:38:18.785 --> 00:38:21.395
That is not what God would want us to treasure,

690
00:38:24.045 --> 00:38:27.355
where we have prioritized things wrongly over him

691
00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:29.675
where we have maybe,

692
00:38:31.515 --> 00:38:33.825
maybe idolized something and,

693
00:38:33.845 --> 00:38:36.365
and our heart is being revealed in that right now.

694
00:38:36.365 --> 00:38:37.885
Listen, that's not a bad thing.

695
00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:39.485
That is not something to run away from.

696
00:38:39.485 --> 00:38:40.725
That's something to press into

697
00:38:40.725 --> 00:38:42.405
because God is just loving you enough

698
00:38:42.465 --> 00:38:43.765
to show you that right now.

699
00:38:45.985 --> 00:38:48.965
He does that for me throughout the weeks as I prepare these

700
00:38:49.475 --> 00:38:52.045
sermons and, and he's done that and he's doing that.

701
00:38:52.965 --> 00:38:54.325
I believe in some of you right now,

702
00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:57.565
and I pray, I pray God

703
00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:03.365
that you lead us to see that there's a better way.

704
00:39:07.185 --> 00:39:08.765
So maybe what you're seeing is like you just,

705
00:39:09.355 --> 00:39:10.565
okay, I've never done this before.

706
00:39:10.635 --> 00:39:12.725
I've never, never given anything.

707
00:39:12.785 --> 00:39:14.645
And so it's just a baby step first.

708
00:39:17.475 --> 00:39:19.285
Just start small, start regularly,

709
00:39:19.295 --> 00:39:22.445
start trusting the Lord in a small way

710
00:39:23.185 --> 00:39:24.445
and watch what he does with it.

711
00:39:28.645 --> 00:39:29.895
Like, I don't think I can afford that.

712
00:39:29.895 --> 00:39:32.095
Well just do you trust God?

713
00:39:33.795 --> 00:39:35.335
It doesn't mean you give a whole lot.

714
00:39:35.335 --> 00:39:36.895
You, you see what God wants you to give

715
00:39:36.895 --> 00:39:39.135
and maybe it's just a little bit right now, a couple pennies

716
00:39:39.135 --> 00:39:41.815
to go forward and, and just say, God, I want more.

717
00:39:41.935 --> 00:39:43.215
I want to give more to you.

718
00:39:44.055 --> 00:39:46.335
I want to release more in this Lord.

719
00:39:51.085 --> 00:39:53.345
Or maybe you do have a lot and you are giving a lot

720
00:39:53.365 --> 00:39:55.985
and you can see that God is just leading you to another step

721
00:39:55.985 --> 00:39:59.465
of something that you release this selfish thing

722
00:39:59.485 --> 00:40:02.425
so you can give more to God's kingdom purposes,

723
00:40:05.095 --> 00:40:07.305
Whether it's to benevolence, to, to really make sure

724
00:40:07.305 --> 00:40:10.465
that we can care even better for those in our church

725
00:40:10.485 --> 00:40:12.505
who are struggling that they may not even know

726
00:40:13.765 --> 00:40:16.385
or somebody in your CG that is really hurting right now

727
00:40:16.385 --> 00:40:17.825
and you can say, man, let's, let's start

728
00:40:17.825 --> 00:40:19.505
to support them a little bit more

729
00:40:19.645 --> 00:40:21.825
for this season till they can get back on their feet

730
00:40:25.045 --> 00:40:29.105
or give to support this church's ministry that,

731
00:40:29.105 --> 00:40:32.265
that our heart is not to, to find more comforts for us,

732
00:40:32.335 --> 00:40:33.425
more convenience for us,

733
00:40:33.445 --> 00:40:35.985
but to expand the kingdom, to plant churches,

734
00:40:36.125 --> 00:40:38.425
to send missionaries, to care for people in schools

735
00:40:38.775 --> 00:40:41.785
that are impoverished, to support those in our city

736
00:40:41.845 --> 00:40:43.065
who need more what?

737
00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:44.265
That we wanna give more away.

738
00:40:47.745 --> 00:40:52.105
Whatever the Lord's leading you to, we are gonna take a step

739
00:40:52.105 --> 00:40:55.665
that we do every week of, of offering a time of giving

740
00:40:56.485 --> 00:40:59.625
as worship here in a moment.

741
00:40:59.725 --> 00:41:01.825
But that doesn't mean you have to, now there's online,

742
00:41:01.825 --> 00:41:03.225
there's boxes at the doors.

743
00:41:03.365 --> 00:41:04.705
You can send it by the mail.

744
00:41:04.705 --> 00:41:07.545
There's all these things, but just make

745
00:41:08.185 --> 00:41:11.345
a step, even a baby step.

746
00:41:12.125 --> 00:41:14.425
Say, Jesus, I'm committing to you.

747
00:41:14.745 --> 00:41:18.105
I want, I wanna reflect the gospel more

748
00:41:18.975 --> 00:41:20.505
through this one specific way.

749
00:41:21.575 --> 00:41:26.425
Lord, help us In Jesus' name. Amen.

750
00:41:27.255 --> 00:41:29.545
Amen. I wanna invite you to stand as the ushers come.

751
00:41:29.545 --> 00:41:31.785
We're gonna tab this time of giving as we sing,

752
00:41:32.045 --> 00:41:33.745
but let's respond in faith to Him.
