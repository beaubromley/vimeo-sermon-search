00:00:01.175 --> 00:00:02.285
Jamie Authorities say,

2
00:00:02.285 --> 00:00:03.965
this is now a criminal investigation.

3
00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:07.165
Several fires raging now down this street,

4
00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:09.925
smashing grab flash mob at a Nordstrom

5
00:00:13.975 --> 00:00:16.115
police, the number of homeless people on the streets

6
00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.715
and in shelter, medical treatment for minors,

7
00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:21.875
a surprise attack within Israel's borders.

8
00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:22.875
People are for

9
00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.955
holding fireworks.

10
00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.015
And an angel of the Lord appeared to them

11
00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:51.295
and the glory of the Lord shown around them

12
00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:52.855
and they were filled with fear.

13
00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:56.335
And the angel said to them, fear not for behold.

14
00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.095
I bring good news of great joy.

15
00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:07.455
Well, Merry Christmas Church.

16
00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:10.455
Uh, if you are new here, we're grateful

17
00:01:10.455 --> 00:01:11.575
that you would gather with us.

18
00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:13.055
Uh, we're always honored by that.

19
00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:15.095
And so please get to know us.

20
00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.095
We hope you're welcomed and encouraged while

21
00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:18.135
you're here with us today.

22
00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:20.375
Uh, my name's John, one of the pastors here.

23
00:01:20.395 --> 00:01:23.015
And so just invite you now to turn in your copy

24
00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.615
of God's word to Luke chapter two.

25
00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:28.615
Luke chapter two. We're gonna see one

26
00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:31.695
of the more forgotten characters in the Christmas story.

27
00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:35.935
His name is Simeon Luke two is where we'll be today.

28
00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:39.175
We're continuing our series, looking into this good news

29
00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:43.095
of great joy that Christ's arrival brought.

30
00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:46.255
And we're looking at what a few characters said

31
00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:49.495
and their perspective on this nativity scene

32
00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:51.935
as we get into it today.

33
00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:55.935
I want to tell you about what happened on July 4th, 2004.

34
00:01:57.195 --> 00:01:59.855
And so I had invited my girlfriend over

35
00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:02.495
to my house in Stillwater, where we were gonna hang out

36
00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:04.615
for the afternoon before heading out to Boomer Lake

37
00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:06.815
that night to watch the fireworks.

38
00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:08.655
And little did she know

39
00:02:08.655 --> 00:02:11.975
that I'd also invited our families over to a friend's house

40
00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:14.015
where they were getting dinner ready together.

41
00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:15.895
And I think you know where this is heading

42
00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:18.695
at this point right now,

43
00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:20.455
my heart was beating pretty heavily Iactually

44
00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:21.615
feel right now, a little bit.

45
00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:25.055
Um, all day. I was anxious.

46
00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:26.255
That energy in your stomach kind

47
00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:28.735
of gets a little stirring up in your soul, right?

48
00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:32.055
And, and in reality, I was probably the most nervous

49
00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:34.975
because I'd, I'd written her a song that I was going to sing

50
00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:36.615
to her and, uh, play on my guitar.

51
00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:40.935
Now, just, no, don't do that. Listen, it was terrible.

52
00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:43.295
Like it was, oh man.

53
00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:44.855
Uh, it was the only song I've ever written.

54
00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:47.975
And I knew like four basic chords.

55
00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:50.735
She kind of pluck through GCD kind of thing.

56
00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:54.855
And uh, yeah, uh, it was, listen, the only reason I did it's

57
00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:56.695
'cause that's what you're supposed to do back in 2004

58
00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:57.815
with John Mayer, right?

59
00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:00.000
Anybody know that? And that's just write the cool song.

60
00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:01.885
It was not good.

61
00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:06.165
So she graciously as I stumbled through that, uh, but,

62
00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.205
but then very simply right there in my bedroom

63
00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:10.965
at this nasty house I lived in, in college,

64
00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:12.965
we were there in my bedroom.

65
00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.325
I just went down simply in my knee

66
00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:18.565
and proposed, uh, for her hand in marriage in that moment.

67
00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:20.365
And so she said yes.

68
00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:22.645
We went over to our friend's house to tell them

69
00:03:22.645 --> 00:03:25.045
where her family and my family surprised her there.

70
00:03:25.425 --> 00:03:28.405
And we ate dinner, went to Boomer Lake, fireworks, all that.

71
00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:30.925
It was super sweet. But here's the point.

72
00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:33.125
From July 4th, 2004

73
00:03:33.975 --> 00:03:38.045
until May 14th, 2005, when we actually got married,

74
00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:42.205
we were waiting, living

75
00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.485
between two events, right?

76
00:03:44.485 --> 00:03:45.925
Something had happened

77
00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:49.605
and something was going to happen in the future.

78
00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:53.965
And, and in between those two dates, we were waiting.

79
00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:57.165
We were waiting between proposal and between the vows.

80
00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:58.205
So she'd said yes,

81
00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:01.725
but soon was coming that we were both going to say I do.

82
00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:04.445
Right? There was a gap between those.

83
00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:08.365
Yet I heard a pastor talk about this recently that that kind

84
00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:10.845
of waiting between those two things is very unique, kind

85
00:04:10.845 --> 00:04:14.965
of waiting that there are all kinds of seasons of waiting

86
00:04:14.965 --> 00:04:18.875
that we have in our lives, like waiting

87
00:04:19.015 --> 00:04:23.475
for test results where you hope something didn't happen

88
00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:25.315
or hasn't happened or isn't happening,

89
00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:29.195
or there's waiting on something that may never happen.

90
00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:32.315
Like you may never get that call back from the job,

91
00:04:32.415 --> 00:04:34.875
or you may never have that relationship you long for,

92
00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:38.435
or there's a waiting that's frustrating.

93
00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:40.395
Like when you're sitting at a red light

94
00:04:40.395 --> 00:04:42.555
and you're like, this thing's been way too long,

95
00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:45.835
or this morning when your kid just wasn't getting ready

96
00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:46.875
quickly enough, you're waiting.

97
00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:48.515
And it's frustrating.

98
00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:53.675
But this in-between waiting is different.

99
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:58.035
It's a waiting that looks back at something

100
00:04:58.035 --> 00:05:01.995
that has happened, yet it is also linked

101
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.475
to something that will happen.

102
00:05:05.815 --> 00:05:09.035
So in between, there's this measure of, of confidence

103
00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:10.035
that we have,

104
00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:12.355
because the thing that I'm waiting for,

105
00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:16.515
I already have a measure of it in my life.

106
00:05:18.895 --> 00:05:22.395
See, our relationship changed on July 4th, 2004.

107
00:05:23.575 --> 00:05:28.395
So between Emily and me, there was a, a stated public love

108
00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:31.355
and commitment, but it wasn't the same way,

109
00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:33.475
not the same way it would be at the wedding.

110
00:05:36.165 --> 00:05:38.105
Yet think about that in between waiting like

111
00:05:38.335 --> 00:05:40.985
that changed our lives, right?

112
00:05:42.095 --> 00:05:45.265
That in-between process, something had happened, right?

113
00:05:45.405 --> 00:05:47.905
So we began to prepare for something that was going

114
00:05:47.905 --> 00:05:49.585
to happen, prepare for the wedding.

115
00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:52.745
We began to prepare for our life together for the marriage.

116
00:05:52.765 --> 00:05:54.705
We would have. We, so you're starting to look for houses,

117
00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:55.905
you're starting to find jobs.

118
00:05:56.005 --> 00:05:58.005
You're figuring out how this is all gonna work,

119
00:05:58.065 --> 00:05:59.645
and bank account, all that stuff.

120
00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:00.965
You're starting to figure that out.

121
00:06:00.965 --> 00:06:03.405
Premarital counseling, you're doing these things to prepare

122
00:06:03.465 --> 00:06:04.685
for a future event.

123
00:06:04.785 --> 00:06:08.685
It was an active waiting, not just sitting

124
00:06:08.685 --> 00:06:11.285
around doing nothing, waiting for a date in the future,

125
00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:16.275
Something had happened and something would happen.

126
00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.075
And that life was lived in between.

127
00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:25.145
And Christian, listen, because of when you were born,

128
00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:31.055
all of our lives are lived in the, in-between

129
00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:38.155
2000 years ago, God, the son took on flesh,

130
00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:41.195
born in Bethlehem, ministered in Galilee,

131
00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:44.115
crucified in Jerusalem, resurrected in power,

132
00:06:44.475 --> 00:06:46.075
ascended back to heaven in glory.

133
00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:47.595
That happened then.

134
00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:51.795
And one day in the future, he is going to return

135
00:06:52.135 --> 00:06:53.595
to make all things right.

136
00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:57.395
He's going to give us his presence face-to-face,

137
00:06:57.615 --> 00:07:00.995
not just spiritually, where we'll see him in perfect peace

138
00:07:01.135 --> 00:07:02.635
and perfect joy.

139
00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:08.415
For now, though we're waiting, we're in between.

140
00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:13.555
Yet it can be a confident waiting

141
00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:17.455
because something has happened.

142
00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:20.695
We know that something will happen.

143
00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:26.975
And so we already have a measure of it already,

144
00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:29.535
which gives us confidence that it's coming in the future.

145
00:07:32.255 --> 00:07:35.495
Simeon shows us what faithful waiting looks like.

146
00:07:37.405 --> 00:07:39.415
He's in a different season of waiting. We'll see that.

147
00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:42.055
But he shows us as we look at Luke two.

148
00:07:42.075 --> 00:07:44.335
Now this, this example of faithfulness

149
00:07:44.955 --> 00:07:47.415
in the in-between that he was in.

150
00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:51.505
So look now Luke two starting in verse 22.

151
00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:58.885
And when the time came for their purification, according

152
00:07:58.885 --> 00:08:01.965
to the law of Moses, they, that's being Joseph and Mary.

153
00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:05.845
They brought him Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him

154
00:08:05.865 --> 00:08:08.605
to the Lord as it is written, the law of the Lord.

155
00:08:08.615 --> 00:08:11.045
Every male who first opens the womb shall be called

156
00:08:11.195 --> 00:08:12.325
holy to the Lord.

157
00:08:13.385 --> 00:08:15.965
And to offer a sacrifice according to

158
00:08:15.965 --> 00:08:19.405
what is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves

159
00:08:19.505 --> 00:08:21.485
or two young pigeons.

160
00:08:22.985 --> 00:08:24.845
Now, we've, we've actually jumped ahead

161
00:08:24.845 --> 00:08:25.925
in the narrative a little bit here.

162
00:08:26.425 --> 00:08:28.405
So we're not going in chronological order.

163
00:08:28.405 --> 00:08:32.365
This is a scene that is after Jesus has already been born.

164
00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:34.525
We're gonna take next week, Christmas Eve

165
00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:37.685
to look at the actual birth narrative in Luke two earlier.

166
00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:41.125
Uh, but, but today we've jumped ahead and,

167
00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:44.205
and we're gonna look at, at how faithful these people were.

168
00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:46.925
So first we see Jesus's parents, how devout they were

169
00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:48.445
to following the Lord.

170
00:08:49.705 --> 00:08:51.965
It describes some events that are kind of confusing to us.

171
00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:55.165
We don't really know what this looks like in our day,

172
00:08:55.465 --> 00:08:58.925
but the purification that this is talking about was mandated

173
00:08:58.945 --> 00:09:01.725
by God's law for a mother after giving birth,

174
00:09:01.795 --> 00:09:04.565
because that would ritually make her unclean.

175
00:09:04.865 --> 00:09:08.685
And so they had a process to be cleansed in that sense.

176
00:09:08.685 --> 00:09:09.845
So that's what they were coming to do.

177
00:09:10.185 --> 00:09:12.525
But it was also a time for this new family

178
00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:16.325
to worship the Lord, to give thanks to the Lord

179
00:09:16.325 --> 00:09:18.365
through the sacrifices that they would offer.

180
00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:22.605
By the way, notice that this, this was a poor family.

181
00:09:23.925 --> 00:09:26.295
They couldn't even afford a lamb to offer a sacrifice.

182
00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:27.575
So God gave a stipulation.

183
00:09:27.575 --> 00:09:31.415
They could have two birds instead of a, a lamb and a bird.

184
00:09:31.795 --> 00:09:33.535
That's how poor Jesus grew up.

185
00:09:33.555 --> 00:09:37.655
So just know God uses all kinds of families in this.

186
00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:41.655
But notice Joseph and Mary, they were so committed

187
00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:43.575
to faithfully obeying the Lord.

188
00:09:43.575 --> 00:09:46.775
What did they do? They, they sacrificed, they purified,

189
00:09:46.775 --> 00:09:51.175
but they also then dedicated this miracle baby to the Lord.

190
00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:52.975
Again, the Old Testament required that

191
00:09:52.975 --> 00:09:55.135
of the firstborn people would do that ritual.

192
00:09:55.555 --> 00:09:57.975
But Joseph and Mary actually followed through.

193
00:09:57.975 --> 00:10:00.335
They said, this is important to us here.

194
00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:03.095
This baby God gave us, God, it's yours.

195
00:10:05.195 --> 00:10:07.095
So Joseph and Mary, great examples of faithfulness.

196
00:10:07.155 --> 00:10:09.575
But, but next, we're introduced to Simeon,

197
00:10:10.435 --> 00:10:12.015
and this is our main focus today.

198
00:10:12.015 --> 00:10:15.295
And I want you to look at verses 25 and 26 to start with.

199
00:10:17.685 --> 00:10:20.305
Now, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon.

200
00:10:21.095 --> 00:10:22.265
This man was righteous

201
00:10:22.265 --> 00:10:25.145
and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel.

202
00:10:25.685 --> 00:10:27.665
And the Holy Spirit was upon him,

203
00:10:28.885 --> 00:10:32.505
and it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit

204
00:10:32.535 --> 00:10:34.145
that he would not see death

205
00:10:34.405 --> 00:10:37.985
before he had seen the Lord's Christ, the Messiah.

206
00:10:40.225 --> 00:10:42.645
And so here we're introduced to this idea of waiting, right?

207
00:10:44.065 --> 00:10:46.525
But, but what was Simeon waiting on?

208
00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:50.085
It says he was waiting on the consolation of Israel.

209
00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:52.005
It's an interesting phrase.

210
00:10:52.025 --> 00:10:56.085
We don't talk like that very often. But what is consolation?

211
00:10:56.595 --> 00:10:59.005
What does it mean to console someone?

212
00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:03.835
Well, it means when someone is down, you work at trying

213
00:11:03.835 --> 00:11:06.035
to encourage them, trying to cheer them up.

214
00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:09.595
You, you work at ways to alleviate their grief.

215
00:11:09.985 --> 00:11:13.115
Take the pain away. That's what consolation is.

216
00:11:14.885 --> 00:11:17.025
And that happens all over the New Testament.

217
00:11:17.025 --> 00:11:18.825
You see people like Anna, which is right

218
00:11:18.825 --> 00:11:20.665
after the story of Simeon, we're not gonna study that fully,

219
00:11:20.685 --> 00:11:24.705
but Anna is waiting for the redemption of Israel.

220
00:11:24.735 --> 00:11:27.385
There's others waiting for the kingdom of God to come.

221
00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:28.585
You see it all over the place.

222
00:11:28.685 --> 00:11:31.105
But what they're waiting for is

223
00:11:31.105 --> 00:11:33.905
what Isaiah 700 years earlier prophesied.

224
00:11:35.565 --> 00:11:37.065
Isaiah 40, verses one

225
00:11:37.065 --> 00:11:41.425
and two says, comfort, comfort, my people, says your God,

226
00:11:42.195 --> 00:11:44.145
speak tenderly to Jerusalem

227
00:11:44.525 --> 00:11:47.385
and cry to her that her warfare is ended,

228
00:11:48.135 --> 00:11:50.225
that her iniquity is pardoned,

229
00:11:50.895 --> 00:11:52.945
that she's received from the Lord's hand, double

230
00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:55.205
for all her sins.

231
00:11:55.385 --> 00:11:57.685
See, they were waiting on this comfort

232
00:11:58.675 --> 00:12:00.005
that the warfare would be over.

233
00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:01.725
Peace would come. The prince

234
00:12:01.725 --> 00:12:03.325
of peace we now know would come.

235
00:12:04.965 --> 00:12:09.285
Simeon was waiting in between God's promises he'd made like

236
00:12:09.285 --> 00:12:12.405
that one and the Messiah's arrival,

237
00:12:14.055 --> 00:12:17.785
waiting for the consolation of Israel, waiting

238
00:12:17.845 --> 00:12:20.865
for this Christ, the Messiah, to come

239
00:12:20.925 --> 00:12:25.545
and fulfill these promises, to renew their hope.

240
00:12:27.805 --> 00:12:31.385
Isaiah said it again in Isaiah 25 verse

241
00:12:31.455 --> 00:12:34.025
nine, about that day.

242
00:12:34.165 --> 00:12:37.025
It says, it will be said on that day, behold,

243
00:12:37.175 --> 00:12:38.625
this is our God.

244
00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:42.825
We have waited for him that he might save us.

245
00:12:43.935 --> 00:12:46.505
This is the Lord. We have waited for him.

246
00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:50.905
Let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

247
00:12:52.445 --> 00:12:55.875
Right? So Simeon is looking back at God's

248
00:12:55.995 --> 00:12:57.915
promises, God's character.

249
00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:02.075
And he's looking not only at the 700 years ago

250
00:13:02.135 --> 00:13:05.235
and further promises, he's also then been told

251
00:13:05.455 --> 00:13:09.235
by God's spirit that he was gonna get to see the Messiah.

252
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:12.395
So he's banking on all these promises.

253
00:13:12.655 --> 00:13:16.275
And as he waited, he was saying, God, I know Yahweh,

254
00:13:16.355 --> 00:13:18.195
I know you're gonna come through for your people.

255
00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:24.395
I know you will come through for us. That's faith.

256
00:13:28.605 --> 00:13:32.625
Now, that is the context into which

257
00:13:33.315 --> 00:13:37.705
these three, four people entered into that temple

258
00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:42.535
on that particular day with Joseph

259
00:13:42.715 --> 00:13:47.055
and Mary carrying the weeks old savior of the world,

260
00:13:49.045 --> 00:13:52.445
Simeon led by the Holy Spirit into the temple.

261
00:13:52.715 --> 00:13:55.805
They didn't know each other, we assume before this moment.

262
00:13:58.225 --> 00:14:02.945
Yet when Simeon saw that young family, when he saw

263
00:14:03.255 --> 00:14:07.545
that baby, he immediately knew.

264
00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.275
And so I just want you to imagine for a second just kind

265
00:14:13.275 --> 00:14:16.595
of picture in your head, the temple Simeon, Joseph

266
00:14:16.615 --> 00:14:17.835
and Mary holding baby Jesus.

267
00:14:17.905 --> 00:14:19.835
Just kind of picture that moment in your head

268
00:14:21.765 --> 00:14:25.665
and just imagine for a second, imagine

269
00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:31.505
Simeon's demeanor as he walked over

270
00:14:31.685 --> 00:14:32.985
to this young couple

271
00:14:33.615 --> 00:14:37.145
that he saw maybe from afar in the temple courts.

272
00:14:37.145 --> 00:14:39.185
And he, and he walks towards them

273
00:14:39.185 --> 00:14:42.785
with his tear filled gaze just fixed on that child.

274
00:14:45.775 --> 00:14:49.635
Now, now we might think Mary would be afraid of this

275
00:14:51.245 --> 00:14:53.565
stranger walking towards her like this, right?

276
00:14:55.415 --> 00:14:57.725
She'd be like, kinda carry in like Joseph, get in the way.

277
00:14:57.985 --> 00:15:00.925
Um, but remember the, the spirit

278
00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:02.525
of God was all over this scene, right?

279
00:15:03.475 --> 00:15:05.365
This was God's work.

280
00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:11.365
And and so Simeon, we know gently tenderly walks over

281
00:15:11.545 --> 00:15:13.445
and picks up baby Jesus.

282
00:15:13.585 --> 00:15:17.725
And as he holds Jesus in his arms,

283
00:15:17.945 --> 00:15:19.125
he couldn't help but worship.

284
00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:24.695
He couldn't help but bless God. Praise God.

285
00:15:26.955 --> 00:15:28.125
It's what we have recorded here.

286
00:15:28.985 --> 00:15:31.845
And Luke two, look at verses 29 through 32,

287
00:15:31.845 --> 00:15:34.845
these beautiful truths that Simeon declares

288
00:15:34.865 --> 00:15:36.765
as he's holding the Savior in his arms.

289
00:15:38.785 --> 00:15:43.285
He said, Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in

290
00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:46.295
peace according to your word,

291
00:15:47.435 --> 00:15:49.935
for my eyes, have seen your salvation

292
00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:54.625
that you've prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light

293
00:15:54.685 --> 00:15:57.705
for revelation to the Gentiles, for glory

294
00:15:58.005 --> 00:16:00.425
to your people Israel, meaning this is universal.

295
00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:02.145
God, thank you for it.

296
00:16:02.145 --> 00:16:06.795
But, but I want you to see what Simeon just said. Right?

297
00:16:06.855 --> 00:16:08.715
No, notice what he just said.

298
00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:12.035
Basically, he was saying, God, I, I don't have

299
00:16:12.035 --> 00:16:13.475
to watch this child grow up.

300
00:16:15.145 --> 00:16:18.475
Like I don't even need to see him do anything.

301
00:16:18.675 --> 00:16:20.195
I don't need to hear him say anything.

302
00:16:20.435 --> 00:16:22.155
I don't need to watch miracles walking on

303
00:16:22.155 --> 00:16:23.475
water, see his resurrection.

304
00:16:23.475 --> 00:16:25.155
I don't need any of that.

305
00:16:25.305 --> 00:16:28.395
I've seen all I need to see, let me die in peace.

306
00:16:32.295 --> 00:16:33.595
He didn't care about vindication

307
00:16:33.705 --> 00:16:34.955
because he had been waiting.

308
00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:37.795
He'd been living as if this was going to happen.

309
00:16:37.855 --> 00:16:39.435
He didn't walk around saying, I told you.

310
00:16:39.435 --> 00:16:42.675
So he just wanted to enter into this rest

311
00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:47.735
and peace that God had promised for thousands of years.

312
00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:50.895
He's like, I've got, I see it. He's here.

313
00:16:51.715 --> 00:16:53.055
He didn't care what other people thought.

314
00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:54.975
He focused on the Lord.

315
00:16:56.165 --> 00:16:58.015
It's interesting, even the word he uses

316
00:16:58.075 --> 00:17:00.215
for Lord here in the opening line

317
00:17:00.215 --> 00:17:02.895
of this is not the typical word used in the New Testament.

318
00:17:04.885 --> 00:17:07.935
It's actually where we get our word today, despot.

319
00:17:09.115 --> 00:17:11.615
That's got a negative connotation in our day, right?

320
00:17:11.615 --> 00:17:14.495
But it wasn't used that way in the New Testament, Simeon,

321
00:17:14.495 --> 00:17:16.695
what he's doing with that is he's acknowledging

322
00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:20.615
my total allegiance, my submission

323
00:17:20.955 --> 00:17:22.815
to the absolute authority God has.

324
00:17:25.155 --> 00:17:26.495
God, I am your servant.

325
00:17:31.405 --> 00:17:32.655
Well, of course, Mary and Joseph,

326
00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:35.295
as this stranger says these things, they were in awe.

327
00:17:35.295 --> 00:17:38.095
Which by the way, all the things Mary and Joseph have heard

328
00:17:38.095 --> 00:17:39.215
and seen by this point, why

329
00:17:39.215 --> 00:17:40.295
would they still be amazed at this?

330
00:17:40.295 --> 00:17:42.575
Right? But they were,

331
00:17:42.635 --> 00:17:45.135
and I think more of it is not surprised, more

332
00:17:45.135 --> 00:17:47.535
of it's just like stunned amazement

333
00:17:47.535 --> 00:17:49.015
that God would let them be a part of this.

334
00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:53.205
But that led Simeon to turn to them and prophesy this.

335
00:17:53.395 --> 00:17:55.285
Look at verses 34 and 35.

336
00:17:59.045 --> 00:18:00.085
Simeon blessed them

337
00:18:00.825 --> 00:18:04.485
and said to Mary his mother, behold, this child is appointed

338
00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:06.645
for the fall and rising of many in Israel

339
00:18:07.305 --> 00:18:09.765
and for a sign that is opposed.

340
00:18:10.905 --> 00:18:13.805
And a sword will pierce through your own soul also.

341
00:18:14.725 --> 00:18:18.425
So that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.

342
00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:22.245
Now, what in the world did he mean by all that?

343
00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:28.045
Well, first, he uses this language of fall and rising.

344
00:18:29.765 --> 00:18:32.855
What that means is that with this Messiah,

345
00:18:33.225 --> 00:18:34.815
there is no neutrality.

346
00:18:38.135 --> 00:18:41.195
You are either for Christ or you're against Christ.

347
00:18:44.015 --> 00:18:48.515
We either trip over him or are established by him.

348
00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:52.545
What Simeon is saying here is

349
00:18:52.545 --> 00:18:56.185
that this Christ is the fulcrum of history.

350
00:18:58.005 --> 00:19:01.155
Everything hinges one way or the other on him.

351
00:19:04.405 --> 00:19:06.065
But he also said, this baby would grow up

352
00:19:06.065 --> 00:19:08.905
to be a sign that is opposed.

353
00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:13.225
That sign is a strong word that means a manifestation

354
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:16.705
so visible, so clear that no one could miss it.

355
00:19:19.295 --> 00:19:21.585
It's the same word used for the miracles

356
00:19:21.585 --> 00:19:22.665
that Jesus would perform

357
00:19:22.665 --> 00:19:24.065
throughout the rest of the New Testament.

358
00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:26.465
The rest of the gospels that you see him do signs.

359
00:19:28.165 --> 00:19:31.185
And what those signs would often do, remember the scenes

360
00:19:31.185 --> 00:19:32.265
of him doing miracles?

361
00:19:32.275 --> 00:19:33.985
There were people who were just like, thank you.

362
00:19:34.245 --> 00:19:35.385
God is here kingdoms.

363
00:19:35.485 --> 00:19:39.165
But then there were other people Who saw the same sign

364
00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:42.685
and they said, no, he's not legit.

365
00:19:44.385 --> 00:19:48.085
It would reveal their hearts, right?

366
00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:55.325
He is the sign that would be opposed, even

367
00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:57.045
for Mary herself.

368
00:19:59.715 --> 00:20:01.175
She would have to decide that.

369
00:20:02.215 --> 00:20:04.535
'cause Simeon here gave her a very personal prophecy

370
00:20:05.065 --> 00:20:07.735
about her future, that she was going to stand there

371
00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:10.615
and watch her son be crucified.

372
00:20:12.435 --> 00:20:14.415
And as a parent, you would feel that, of course,

373
00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:16.055
for her son being murdered, you'd feel

374
00:20:16.055 --> 00:20:17.575
that deeply inside of you.

375
00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:20.575
But, but it would be deeper than that even

376
00:20:20.705 --> 00:20:23.135
where she would have to be confronted in that moment

377
00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:25.815
of whether this is the saving son of God or not.

378
00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:32.125
Even her heart would be revealed in this moment.

379
00:20:37.225 --> 00:20:39.965
And so that's the scene we have here with Simeon

380
00:20:40.025 --> 00:20:41.485
and Joseph and Mary and Jesus.

381
00:20:41.745 --> 00:20:43.685
And, and, and listen, I get the blessing

382
00:20:43.685 --> 00:20:44.885
of studying this all week,

383
00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.285
and so I get to know it pretty well here.

384
00:20:48.385 --> 00:20:50.525
But, but what I don't want

385
00:20:50.525 --> 00:20:53.125
to have happen in my ministry life is

386
00:20:53.125 --> 00:20:56.685
that these things like this, any text becomes academic.

387
00:20:58.435 --> 00:21:00.485
It's just about what it says and getting it right

388
00:21:00.505 --> 00:21:02.685
and making sure everybody's hurry, hearing what I want

389
00:21:02.685 --> 00:21:04.365
to hear and what God wants to say.

390
00:21:04.365 --> 00:21:07.245
Like it can't become merely academic.

391
00:21:07.265 --> 00:21:08.725
So I heard another pastor do this and

392
00:21:09.025 --> 00:21:10.045
and I did this this week.

393
00:21:10.205 --> 00:21:11.445
I asked myself the question,

394
00:21:13.885 --> 00:21:17.705
If Simeon is an example of faith in between,

395
00:21:20.845 --> 00:21:23.505
so what would it look like to allow his words

396
00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:27.025
and his life to, to kind of

397
00:21:27.545 --> 00:21:32.435
diagnose me this week, to diagnose us?

398
00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:38.945
Like what if we just hold his waiting life up against

399
00:21:39.485 --> 00:21:41.865
our waiting lives and just see where we are?

400
00:21:45.515 --> 00:21:48.095
So here I wanna ask three questions today.

401
00:21:49.195 --> 00:21:51.005
Here are three questions for us to consider

402
00:21:51.005 --> 00:21:53.645
as we allow the Lord to meet us in this as we allow him

403
00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:55.325
to convict us and strengthen us,

404
00:21:55.425 --> 00:21:58.565
and as we allow him to lead us to repentance as we need it.

405
00:21:58.565 --> 00:22:00.845
Like, like, just, just ask a couple questions here

406
00:22:01.995 --> 00:22:04.365
that I've been asking myself all week and,

407
00:22:04.505 --> 00:22:07.525
and you'll hear wrestling with, but,

408
00:22:07.545 --> 00:22:11.775
but just allow this to, to search you, search us.

409
00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:14.935
Here's the first question.

410
00:22:16.755 --> 00:22:20.135
Is the Holy Spirit upon us, like Simeon

411
00:22:23.185 --> 00:22:25.125
is the Holy Spirit upon us?

412
00:22:26.805 --> 00:22:30.735
Like Simeon's example showed he

413
00:22:30.735 --> 00:22:32.455
was in Simeon's life.

414
00:22:34.675 --> 00:22:36.855
Now, you, you read carefully when you read God's word

415
00:22:36.915 --> 00:22:39.855
and Luke was clearly trying to communicate something to us.

416
00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:41.095
Tell us something here,

417
00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:45.455
because three times in three verses, God's spirit

418
00:22:45.995 --> 00:22:48.175
is mentioned involving Simeon.

419
00:22:48.995 --> 00:22:50.695
Now, did you see this? Verse 25,

420
00:22:51.595 --> 00:22:53.535
the Holy Spirit was upon him.

421
00:22:54.705 --> 00:22:58.575
Verse 26. It was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit

422
00:22:58.765 --> 00:23:01.215
that he would not see death before he saw the Christ.

423
00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:05.575
Verse 27, Simeon came in the spirit

424
00:23:06.565 --> 00:23:07.775
into the temple.

425
00:23:07.955 --> 00:23:11.775
So, so Simeon was clearly deeply connected

426
00:23:12.045 --> 00:23:16.015
with God's spirit, and he was in tune with God's spirit

427
00:23:16.015 --> 00:23:19.135
because he was so focused on God

428
00:23:19.275 --> 00:23:21.015
and his work in the world.

429
00:23:25.515 --> 00:23:26.855
How many of us would say

430
00:23:26.855 --> 00:23:29.535
that we have a similar experience with God?

431
00:23:33.985 --> 00:23:36.725
You know, if I'm honest, I would have to say that

432
00:23:36.725 --> 00:23:38.165
that's not my experience.

433
00:23:38.165 --> 00:23:41.935
Most of the time. You just look at the picture

434
00:23:41.935 --> 00:23:43.375
of Simeon and how he was so in tune.

435
00:23:43.495 --> 00:23:46.805
I I see so many differences

436
00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:50.245
and many of us honestly would have the theological language

437
00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:53.005
to say the right things about the Holy Spirit.

438
00:23:55.655 --> 00:23:59.815
But do we really know him like Simeon did?

439
00:24:02.895 --> 00:24:04.035
Are we being led

440
00:24:04.135 --> 00:24:07.275
and controlled by the Lord where every thought,

441
00:24:07.605 --> 00:24:10.915
every action is done in light of what he would want?

442
00:24:13.915 --> 00:24:16.055
And listen, I don't want this to be, I don't mean for this

443
00:24:16.055 --> 00:24:20.225
to be discouraging because we

444
00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:21.265
need to remember something here.

445
00:24:22.165 --> 00:24:26.025
We, we we're not in the same waiting game that Simeon

446
00:24:26.045 --> 00:24:27.265
and those believers were in.

447
00:24:27.275 --> 00:24:29.425
We're, we're a post, a big event.

448
00:24:29.765 --> 00:24:32.145
And, and so, so we need to remember something here.

449
00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:36.945
We as Christians have something

450
00:24:37.135 --> 00:24:38.665
that those believers didn't have.

451
00:24:42.595 --> 00:24:44.895
Here's how Ephesians chapter one puts

452
00:24:44.895 --> 00:24:47.665
it in him.

453
00:24:47.765 --> 00:24:50.665
In Christ, you also, when you heard the word of truth,

454
00:24:50.765 --> 00:24:52.265
the gospel of your salvation

455
00:24:52.565 --> 00:24:55.465
and believed in him, when you were saved, converted,

456
00:24:55.805 --> 00:24:59.145
you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit

457
00:24:59.645 --> 00:25:00.785
who is the guarantee

458
00:25:00.785 --> 00:25:03.905
of our inheritance till we acquire possession of it

459
00:25:04.165 --> 00:25:05.665
to the praise of His glory.

460
00:25:08.055 --> 00:25:12.875
See, the difference now, now that Christ has died,

461
00:25:13.355 --> 00:25:16.395
resurrected and ascended, is

462
00:25:16.395 --> 00:25:20.795
that he sent his Holy Spirit into believers permanently.

463
00:25:23.635 --> 00:25:25.995
Simeon yes was one of a few,

464
00:25:26.335 --> 00:25:28.155
but not every believer at that time

465
00:25:28.175 --> 00:25:31.595
and all the way back in Israel had the Holy Spirit in them

466
00:25:32.855 --> 00:25:34.785
like we now do Christian.

467
00:25:38.055 --> 00:25:42.335
And what that means is what was true of Simeon

468
00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:45.395
can be true of us.

469
00:25:48.565 --> 00:25:51.905
The spirit was upon him. The spirit was leading him.

470
00:25:52.725 --> 00:25:55.185
The Spirit is inside you believer.

471
00:25:56.815 --> 00:25:59.995
And so what we have the opportunity to do is,

472
00:26:00.175 --> 00:26:04.075
is we can have this, there's not some special formula.

473
00:26:05.445 --> 00:26:07.355
Don't think you have to like, sell everything

474
00:26:07.375 --> 00:26:09.555
and go move to the temple like Simeon or Anna.

475
00:26:09.585 --> 00:26:12.275
Like don't think you have to go get in the woods

476
00:26:12.335 --> 00:26:13.995
and just be in communion with God.

477
00:26:13.995 --> 00:26:15.875
All that's not a special formula here.

478
00:26:16.215 --> 00:26:20.555
All it takes is an open heart, open hands,

479
00:26:21.115 --> 00:26:24.515
allowing him lordship of our lives

480
00:26:27.135 --> 00:26:31.585
that he calls the shots, he directs, he moves and we follow.

481
00:26:36.155 --> 00:26:37.335
By the way, just so you're hearing

482
00:26:37.405 --> 00:26:39.575
what you're hearing right now, it's not an alarm.

483
00:26:40.485 --> 00:26:41.495
It's not somebody's phone

484
00:26:43.215 --> 00:26:45.925
after this service head, the lobby,

485
00:26:46.825 --> 00:26:49.445
our special needs joyful sound choir is doing hand

486
00:26:49.455 --> 00:26:51.005
bells of Christmas carols.

487
00:26:51.025 --> 00:26:52.245
It is so good.

488
00:26:53.025 --> 00:26:55.205
So as soon as we're done in here, head out there, right?

489
00:26:55.265 --> 00:26:57.605
It, it's worth it. So just in case as you're hearing that,

490
00:26:57.605 --> 00:27:02.565
that's what you're hearing over the next few minutes, but,

491
00:27:02.565 --> 00:27:06.165
but just think about this is the Holy Spirit control.

492
00:27:06.265 --> 00:27:08.245
Am I submitting like this?

493
00:27:08.245 --> 00:27:11.965
Like what if, what if I allowed him to lead every step

494
00:27:11.965 --> 00:27:15.885
of my life And, and just lived in that?

495
00:27:15.955 --> 00:27:17.525
What if, what if I asked him,

496
00:27:17.745 --> 00:27:18.925
God, what do you want me to do?

497
00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:20.485
Who do you want me to talk to? Who do you want

498
00:27:20.485 --> 00:27:21.525
me to sit by when I come in?

499
00:27:21.595 --> 00:27:24.205
Like, what if we got out of our own way

500
00:27:25.985 --> 00:27:28.165
in our lives and in here?

501
00:27:29.775 --> 00:27:31.105
What if we got out of our own way

502
00:27:31.105 --> 00:27:32.985
and just said, holy Spirit, you do whatever you want.

503
00:27:35.995 --> 00:27:38.635
I think we would live more fully alive kind of lives.

504
00:27:40.935 --> 00:27:42.595
It would look a lot more like Simeon.

505
00:27:44.755 --> 00:27:46.875
I I pray God would do that in me.

506
00:27:49.265 --> 00:27:51.885
So is the Holy Spirit upon us like Simeon, let

507
00:27:51.885 --> 00:27:53.245
that diagnose you.

508
00:27:54.245 --> 00:27:55.345
Here's the second question.

509
00:27:57.365 --> 00:28:00.735
What is Christ revealing about our hearts?

510
00:28:02.305 --> 00:28:04.835
What is Christ revealing about our hearts?

511
00:28:07.555 --> 00:28:09.835
Remember, that's what Simeon said to Mary at the end,

512
00:28:11.435 --> 00:28:13.885
that this Christ, this child,

513
00:28:13.885 --> 00:28:15.365
would be the fulcrum of history.

514
00:28:15.365 --> 00:28:18.565
There's no neutrality when you consider Jesus.

515
00:28:18.865 --> 00:28:21.605
You can't be halfway.

516
00:28:24.675 --> 00:28:27.415
And so I asked that question of me this week,

517
00:28:29.785 --> 00:28:31.005
and I had to be honest

518
00:28:31.465 --> 00:28:33.635
and face the reality that

519
00:28:33.695 --> 00:28:37.115
so often my heart is divided in its loyalties.

520
00:28:39.525 --> 00:28:43.365
I mean, just think about Christ scanning an X-ray

521
00:28:43.785 --> 00:28:45.205
of our day-to-day lives.

522
00:28:48.305 --> 00:28:49.895
Where do our motivations land?

523
00:28:51.295 --> 00:28:54.225
Like what's deep inside here?

524
00:28:55.125 --> 00:28:58.025
Do we only give lip service to following Jesus?

525
00:29:03.385 --> 00:29:06.665
I love the little nuance Simeon gave in verse 30 when he

526
00:29:06.665 --> 00:29:10.625
prayed, my eyes have seen your salvation.

527
00:29:12.475 --> 00:29:16.575
What was he talking about? That baby, right?

528
00:29:18.365 --> 00:29:21.165
The baby. But,

529
00:29:21.165 --> 00:29:25.285
but he, he hadn't seen Jesus do any of these things

530
00:29:25.285 --> 00:29:26.965
that we know, know He came to do.

531
00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:31.565
But Jesus is a baby. He's holding. I've seen your salvation.

532
00:29:31.865 --> 00:29:33.405
God. This is what Spurgeon said.

533
00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:36.205
Not only the worker of salvation,

534
00:29:36.705 --> 00:29:38.725
but salvation itself.

535
00:29:39.815 --> 00:29:44.565
That's who Christ is. Wherever we see Christ,

536
00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:46.085
we see the salvation of God.

537
00:29:48.315 --> 00:29:50.735
Not only that, he did things to bring salvation.

538
00:29:50.845 --> 00:29:54.095
He's not merely the means to our salvation.

539
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.055
He's not merely the ticket into heaven.

540
00:29:56.325 --> 00:29:58.575
That is not merely who Christ is.

541
00:29:59.115 --> 00:30:03.295
No, we need to see Jesus as salvation itself.

542
00:30:07.265 --> 00:30:09.765
Now, that means, of course, eternally his life, death

543
00:30:09.765 --> 00:30:13.685
and resurrection purchased eternity for us, eternal life.

544
00:30:13.985 --> 00:30:17.765
But also, remember John 10 10, he purchased life abundant

545
00:30:18.105 --> 00:30:19.245
for you every day as well.

546
00:30:21.675 --> 00:30:25.235
Salvation, not just when you die

547
00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:27.785
or when Jesus comes back.

548
00:30:28.185 --> 00:30:32.465
Salvation in everything you're facing right now.

549
00:30:33.975 --> 00:30:35.605
Everything that would ever come your way,

550
00:30:35.655 --> 00:30:37.645
everything you're ever tempted by, everything

551
00:30:37.645 --> 00:30:38.885
that you ever long for.

552
00:30:39.195 --> 00:30:40.845
He's your salvation.

553
00:30:42.335 --> 00:30:45.235
But we have to see, we have to see him as Lord

554
00:30:45.335 --> 00:30:46.795
to get there first, right?

555
00:30:49.905 --> 00:30:51.445
So here, here's the third question.

556
00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:56.325
What's Christ revealing about our hearts? Of course, yes.

557
00:30:56.865 --> 00:30:58.725
But here's the, the final diagnostic.

558
00:30:59.785 --> 00:31:04.025
Are we waiting like Simeon was waiting?

559
00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:10.695
Are we waiting? Like Simeon was waiting?

560
00:31:13.215 --> 00:31:14.985
Just think about what Simeon had experienced

561
00:31:16.405 --> 00:31:17.785
at some point in his life.

562
00:31:19.395 --> 00:31:22.535
The spirit of God told him explicitly that

563
00:31:22.535 --> 00:31:26.135
before Simeon died, he would see Messiah,

564
00:31:28.475 --> 00:31:31.295
all the hopes and dreams of thousands of years

565
00:31:31.475 --> 00:31:32.935
of Israel's history.

566
00:31:35.385 --> 00:31:40.185
He'd see it. So think about

567
00:31:40.205 --> 00:31:43.265
how he would've lived in the, in-between

568
00:31:44.755 --> 00:31:46.845
promise to fulfillment.

569
00:31:46.985 --> 00:31:49.165
How would Simeon have, like, just think first.

570
00:31:49.665 --> 00:31:51.445
How would he have gone into the temple?

571
00:31:54.175 --> 00:31:56.825
Overjoyed, right? I mean,

572
00:31:56.825 --> 00:31:58.505
you can almost see Simeon at this point.

573
00:31:58.655 --> 00:32:01.465
He's walking in every time with his head on his swivel,

574
00:32:01.465 --> 00:32:02.745
like he's expectant.

575
00:32:02.935 --> 00:32:04.105
He's excited.

576
00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:05.465
He's looking around

577
00:32:05.725 --> 00:32:06.745
and he's wondering like,

578
00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:09.025
is today the day I get to meet the Messiah?

579
00:32:11.315 --> 00:32:12.845
Like the priest on duty that day?

580
00:32:13.005 --> 00:32:14.125
Simeon, what are you doing, man?

581
00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:15.845
Hey, I'm just checking to see if Messiah's

582
00:32:15.845 --> 00:32:18.565
here, don't see him yet.

583
00:32:18.705 --> 00:32:22.635
See you tomorrow. Like you, he would've,

584
00:32:22.775 --> 00:32:25.315
he would've been different in his demeanor.

585
00:32:25.465 --> 00:32:28.875
He'd been looking, looking, looking for some,

586
00:32:28.975 --> 00:32:30.755
are we waiting for God like that?

587
00:32:36.085 --> 00:32:38.345
And, and first I want you to think about, are we waiting

588
00:32:38.405 --> 00:32:41.645
for God to move in our circumstances like that?

589
00:32:44.885 --> 00:32:49.025
Are we expecting God to show off according

590
00:32:49.045 --> 00:32:50.105
to his promises?

591
00:32:53.525 --> 00:32:54.785
So I don't know what you're waiting on.

592
00:32:56.705 --> 00:32:58.015
Maybe you're waiting on a relationship.

593
00:33:02.155 --> 00:33:04.945
Maybe you're waiting on answers for an unexplained illness.

594
00:33:08.585 --> 00:33:10.015
Maybe you're waiting for a job

595
00:33:11.395 --> 00:33:13.615
or you're waiting for a prodigal child to come home

596
00:33:17.855 --> 00:33:19.355
And listen, just as a side note,

597
00:33:19.355 --> 00:33:20.555
when we're talking about waiting for something,

598
00:33:20.555 --> 00:33:22.875
we're talking about a genuine promise from God,

599
00:33:23.235 --> 00:33:24.315
a genuine move of God.

600
00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:26.915
Not just like, I'm waiting on a million dollars.

601
00:33:26.915 --> 00:33:27.915
Like no, we're not talking about that.

602
00:33:27.915 --> 00:33:31.395
We're talking about genuine God, things

603
00:33:31.985 --> 00:33:35.155
that he's promised or that he's going to do, right?

604
00:33:35.175 --> 00:33:37.235
That's the idea we're talking about here.

605
00:33:38.215 --> 00:33:42.775
And so whatever you're waiting for, wait,

606
00:33:42.805 --> 00:33:47.605
like Simeon, wait, like Simeon be expectant.

607
00:33:49.295 --> 00:33:53.975
Anticipate him like you're in a a really hard situation.

608
00:33:54.045 --> 00:33:56.295
Okay? God, how are you gonna show off through this?

609
00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:58.975
How are you gonna get more glory through this?

610
00:33:59.355 --> 00:34:02.055
How are you going to prove yourself through this?

611
00:34:04.055 --> 00:34:06.215
'cause here's the thing. We live in a culture

612
00:34:06.215 --> 00:34:07.255
of instant gratification.

613
00:34:07.595 --> 00:34:08.575
God doesn't work like that.

614
00:34:12.845 --> 00:34:16.115
Psalm 27 14 says, wait for the Lord.

615
00:34:18.065 --> 00:34:20.725
Be strong. Let your heart take courage.

616
00:34:21.835 --> 00:34:23.605
Wait for the Lord.

617
00:34:25.735 --> 00:34:27.545
That means humble submission.

618
00:34:27.545 --> 00:34:28.505
God, you're gonna have to do this.

619
00:34:28.505 --> 00:34:29.385
You're gonna have to move.

620
00:34:29.645 --> 00:34:33.155
I'm waiting on you. And

621
00:34:33.155 --> 00:34:35.835
so wait like Simmy in the circumstances you need

622
00:34:35.835 --> 00:34:37.075
to wait on Absolutely.

623
00:34:37.135 --> 00:34:40.115
But also this, and this is even more important for us.

624
00:34:42.465 --> 00:34:47.045
Are we waiting for Christ's second coming?

625
00:34:47.275 --> 00:34:51.855
Like Simeon was his first Simeon waiting

626
00:34:51.855 --> 00:34:53.615
for Messiah to show up the first

627
00:34:53.835 --> 00:34:55.295
advent, the first appearance.

628
00:34:55.595 --> 00:34:56.815
We are after that one,

629
00:34:56.915 --> 00:34:58.375
but we're still waiting on a second

630
00:34:58.435 --> 00:34:59.855
advent for Christ to come back.

631
00:34:59.855 --> 00:35:03.335
Are we waiting like th did for the Messiah?

632
00:35:05.115 --> 00:35:09.365
Like I get so distracted by silly things in the world,

633
00:35:09.785 --> 00:35:12.765
by these meaningless trivialities

634
00:35:12.995 --> 00:35:15.005
that we prioritize in our lives.

635
00:35:15.065 --> 00:35:16.445
And in so many days,

636
00:35:16.525 --> 00:35:18.365
I don't even consider the Lord's return.

637
00:35:21.825 --> 00:35:23.395
What if we all looked for

638
00:35:23.695 --> 00:35:26.475
and worked for the kingdom of God

639
00:35:26.575 --> 00:35:28.595
to come on earth as it is in heaven?

640
00:35:29.385 --> 00:35:32.355
What if we kept our eyes on eternity?

641
00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:37.845
I, I think we'd be way more earthly good

642
00:35:39.075 --> 00:35:40.935
as we kept our eyes fixed on what's coming.

643
00:35:43.545 --> 00:35:47.455
Righteous devouted, the values

644
00:35:47.555 --> 00:35:49.215
of the kingdom coming through.

645
00:35:49.215 --> 00:35:50.815
People who are focused on the kingdom

646
00:35:50.875 --> 00:35:52.215
of God over anything here.

647
00:35:53.275 --> 00:35:54.495
That's what we would look like.

648
00:35:57.315 --> 00:35:59.155
'cause remember what an engaged couple is like.

649
00:36:03.315 --> 00:36:06.835
They're excited. They're actively

650
00:36:06.945 --> 00:36:09.245
preparing for the marriage.

651
00:36:12.855 --> 00:36:13.915
Why are they so excited?

652
00:36:15.815 --> 00:36:18.545
Because Their eyes are fixed on a date

653
00:36:18.765 --> 00:36:19.905
to come in the future.

654
00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:27.015
They wanna be ready. And even as they wait,

655
00:36:27.015 --> 00:36:31.215
there's a thrilled feeling they have in their spirits

656
00:36:31.595 --> 00:36:34.895
as they anticipate this glorious union of marriage to come.

657
00:36:39.085 --> 00:36:41.985
Church. Listen, our wedding day is coming

658
00:36:47.555 --> 00:36:49.745
where the lamb of God who takes away the sin

659
00:36:49.745 --> 00:36:53.465
of the world will come back for his bride.

660
00:36:55.565 --> 00:36:56.785
And so let's wait, church.

661
00:36:59.635 --> 00:37:04.445
Let's wait in love watching, opening our lives

662
00:37:04.465 --> 00:37:05.925
to the spirit's control.

663
00:37:06.655 --> 00:37:08.565
Let's wait. Well,

664
00:37:11.475 --> 00:37:13.715
I heard a story one time about how

665
00:37:14.245 --> 00:37:16.275
these sailors on a Scottish fishing

666
00:37:16.945 --> 00:37:21.475
boat we're returning home after many days at sea.

667
00:37:22.495 --> 00:37:24.115
As they neared the shore,

668
00:37:24.115 --> 00:37:27.315
they gazed eagerly toward the shore

669
00:37:27.455 --> 00:37:31.235
and a group of their loved ones had gathered to greet them.

670
00:37:32.455 --> 00:37:35.835
And the captain looked through his binoculars

671
00:37:35.855 --> 00:37:38.835
and he began to identify some of the men's wives

672
00:37:39.065 --> 00:37:40.315
that he could see.

673
00:37:41.555 --> 00:37:44.955
I see Mary, there's Margaret, there's Anne.

674
00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:49.385
One man though became concerned

675
00:37:49.385 --> 00:37:51.185
because his wife was not there.

676
00:37:53.615 --> 00:37:56.315
And later he left the boat with a heavy heart

677
00:37:56.335 --> 00:37:58.355
and he hurried up the hill to his cottage.

678
00:38:00.735 --> 00:38:03.755
As he opened the door, his wife came running up to meet him.

679
00:38:03.945 --> 00:38:05.395
I've, I've been waiting for you.

680
00:38:08.935 --> 00:38:10.835
He replied with a gentle rebuke.

681
00:38:12.175 --> 00:38:15.995
Yes, but the other men's wives

682
00:38:16.065 --> 00:38:17.435
were watching for them.

683
00:38:21.675 --> 00:38:24.255
May we be a people actively waiting

684
00:38:25.195 --> 00:38:29.275
and watching for the Lord to return.
