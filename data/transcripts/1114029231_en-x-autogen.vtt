WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.025 --> 00:00:03.485
We on.

2
00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:03.965
Alright,

3
00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:09.605
good evening.

4
00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:14.325
Good evening. Welcome. How are you guys? Good to see you.

5
00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:18.405
Unbelievable. Okay. It's what I like to hear. Great.

6
00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:22.525
Come on in. Uh, I don't believe you. No.

7
00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:28.445
Glad you guys are here. If you're new. Thanks for coming.

8
00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:31.325
If you're second time around, thanks for coming back.

9
00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:35.605
So anyway, uh, if you haven't signed in already, David,

10
00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:37.685
do you want to explain that or did you already No.

11
00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:38.925
This letter. Check by your name.

12
00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:41.325
If you're on the roster, if you're not, just sign it.

13
00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:43.535
We got lines over there,

14
00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:45.535
but you don't have to sign if you're brand new.

15
00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:48.855
We've got an outline, a syllabus, uh, that just kind of

16
00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:51.055
as a guide to the class with a calendar on it.

17
00:00:51.675 --> 00:00:55.015
Um, we've got a theme verse, memory verse that, uh,

18
00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:58.295
I'm passing out a verse that's relevant to the whole class

19
00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.775
for each of our sessions.

20
00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:04.775
And, uh, and then there's also class notes avail available.

21
00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:08.375
If you need a pen, uh, flag David down. Let him know.

22
00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:13.215
Also, uh, if you would like to follow along as part of this

23
00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:17.175
class, or if this is your first and only class

24
00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:20.535
and you just wanna read the book we're talking about either

25
00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:22.975
way, uh, we've got a couple more copies.

26
00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:27.655
The book is Bible Doctrine by Wayne Gruden.

27
00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:32.015
If you're familiar with this book, Wayne Gruden

28
00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:34.495
actually has one that's twice this size.

29
00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:37.895
And, uh, if you're really gung-ho, I'd recommend you buy

30
00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:39.975
that one and kind of read the whole thing.

31
00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:42.095
But, uh, this one's a shorter version.

32
00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:45.775
There's actually one that is half as long as this one.

33
00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:49.455
And so it's an either even more accessible version

34
00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:52.255
that if you'd like to check that out, you can do it as well.

35
00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:54.895
But the class textbook is this book

36
00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:56.015
right here, Bible doctrine.

37
00:01:56.675 --> 00:01:58.535
So, um, we got I think two of those.

38
00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:02.335
They're going for $22 each. We don't make money off that.

39
00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:06.575
They actually lose a few pennies if we do it that way.

40
00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:09.335
But anyway, um, that was the cheapest I could find it.

41
00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:12.575
So let's see.

42
00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:17.615
Alright, let me pray for us and we'll get started.

43
00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:23.415
Almighty God, we thank you for this opportunity

44
00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:26.335
to come together as your people in this place.

45
00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:29.775
God, we thank you for the light of your word,

46
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:32.335
that your word says that it is your word.

47
00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:35.855
That it is a light to our feet. It is a lamp to our path.

48
00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:39.295
And I pray that you would give us eyes to see and pray.

49
00:02:39.475 --> 00:02:41.535
In fact, with the psalmist, we would pray, Lord,

50
00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:43.495
open our eyes that we would behold

51
00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:44.975
wonderful things in your word.

52
00:02:45.795 --> 00:02:47.935
And I pray you'd speak to us now, I pray.

53
00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:50.735
Speak to us as we gather, Lord.

54
00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:53.495
Uh, we want to not just learn more about you,

55
00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:56.655
but we also want to get to know you better personally.

56
00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:58.695
And we want to be changed

57
00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:00.765
By the knowledge of who you are.

58
00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:03.645
We want to reflect you rightly in the world.

59
00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:06.805
And so God, we pray that you come have your way in our lives

60
00:03:07.115 --> 00:03:08.285
through Jesus name.

61
00:03:08.475 --> 00:03:12.525
Amen. Alright, uh, all rice is presenting leading us today.

62
00:03:12.545 --> 00:03:15.005
So if you want come on up, we will dive in.

63
00:03:16.665 --> 00:03:17.805
Please sign the roll

64
00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:26.885
stand or do you wanna hold it?

65
00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:31.645
I'll hold it, sir.

66
00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.525
So, uh, I'm the son of a cowboy.

67
00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:38.085
And so, uh, I feel that

68
00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:40.005
whenever I'm around really smart people,

69
00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:42.405
I don't understand things very well.

70
00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:46.445
But, uh, so in this room there are a lot of smart people.

71
00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:49.005
You know, we've got Aaron, we've got Dan, we've got pr,

72
00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:50.765
Steve, a bunch of got Mark.

73
00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:53.885
So they may be able to help us a little bit.

74
00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:56.845
But I thought I would, uh, one thing

75
00:03:56.845 --> 00:03:59.085
that I can do is start with an analogy.

76
00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.365
'cause sometimes I don't understand something,

77
00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:02.885
but an analogy helps me.

78
00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:05.645
So I want you to imagine this is a little brighter.

79
00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:07.005
I was gonna bring the bright one,

80
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:08.525
but I thought it would knock out your redness.

81
00:04:08.545 --> 00:04:09.885
So that's, you know, we don't want that.

82
00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:15.845
So I want you to imagine that the Bible is the sun.

83
00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:19.765
Okay? Now, the sun's got a lot

84
00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:21.325
of good things going for it, right?

85
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.805
What are some things that the sun is good for?

86
00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:30.005
Like light, right? So enlightenment, what else?

87
00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:34.085
Life, heat, life. What else?

88
00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:40.005
Navigation, gravitation, we revolve around it.

89
00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:45.205
Uh, so basically the sun is pretty much the whole

90
00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:46.605
show for our solar system.

91
00:04:48.065 --> 00:04:52.165
Now, the bad news about that is

92
00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:55.765
that if we look at the sun in the wrong way,

93
00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:58.045
it can do us damage.

94
00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:02.685
We have to look at the sun in the right way, right?

95
00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:06.835
Um, and so that's my analogy in the upper left

96
00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:08.955
for the Bible.

97
00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:14.335
The word of God. So this week we're gonna be looking

98
00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:16.575
at the sun, the Bible itself.

99
00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:20.375
Next week we're gonna be thinking about

100
00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:24.215
where we stand in relationship to the sun

101
00:05:24.755 --> 00:05:26.735
and through what sort of goggles.

102
00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:29.975
We look at the sun, that's called terminus, right?

103
00:05:30.825 --> 00:05:32.855
We're gonna do that later this week.

104
00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:36.175
We're just focusing on the notion

105
00:05:36.395 --> 00:05:38.335
of the word of God.

106
00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:42.775
Um, now the stuff that we're gonna talk about today,

107
00:05:42.945 --> 00:05:44.615
often I'll start out with a question

108
00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:46.815
because I think, you know, again,

109
00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:48.335
there's people smarter than me in here.

110
00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:50.135
And so we can get collective wisdom.

111
00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:53.015
Then I may have something to say related

112
00:05:53.275 --> 00:05:54.935
to the sheet of paper there.

113
00:05:56.475 --> 00:05:59.005
But I want us to think about this in two ways.

114
00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:00.965
I want us to think about the Bible

115
00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:02.845
as it relates to ourselves.

116
00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:06.005
What does it do for us?

117
00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:09.365
So for example, encouragement,

118
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:12.445
enlightenment, right, guidance.

119
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.365
But a lot of this stuff we're gonna cover.

120
00:06:16.365 --> 00:06:21.285
Y'all are dang smart that you may say, I know that.

121
00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:26.465
But then I want you to think about how this can help others.

122
00:06:27.445 --> 00:06:29.945
And this is called apologetics. Okay?

123
00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:33.225
So apologetics is a weird word from the Greek,

124
00:06:33.445 --> 00:06:35.945
and it sounds like we're supposed to be apologizing

125
00:06:36.005 --> 00:06:38.865
for things, but really it just means

126
00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:40.825
from the Greek, a defense.

127
00:06:42.445 --> 00:06:46.145
So not only can we learn about the greatness

128
00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:48.225
and the importance of the Bible for ourselves,

129
00:06:48.885 --> 00:06:52.865
but along the way, I mean, how many times do we have people

130
00:06:52.935 --> 00:06:55.345
that we know that say things about the Bible

131
00:06:55.575 --> 00:06:59.465
that aren't true, and we can, uh, explain to them

132
00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:02.745
or defend the validity and the power of the Bible?

133
00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:05.145
Make sense? Mm-hmm. Okay.

134
00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:11.025
So first question that I want to dive into today

135
00:07:11.845 --> 00:07:15.465
is how do we as human beings

136
00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:17.985
know anything about God?

137
00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:23.385
I've been thinking about the notion of, uh, atheism.

138
00:07:24.055 --> 00:07:27.425
Okay? And I used to be a professor guy

139
00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:28.745
and think about other cultures,

140
00:07:30.405 --> 00:07:31.505
and I was trying to think,

141
00:07:31.805 --> 00:07:34.905
was there ever a civilization that was atheist?

142
00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:37.825
And I can't think of it.

143
00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:41.665
I mean, whenever civilization you study,

144
00:07:41.775 --> 00:07:43.585
they believe in the divine.

145
00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:46.785
They believe the divine is the cause of things.

146
00:07:46.885 --> 00:07:50.145
Now, sometimes they believe in polytheism, usually the lots

147
00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:53.465
of gods, but everyone seems

148
00:07:53.485 --> 00:07:57.185
to have an innate concept of the divine,

149
00:07:57.285 --> 00:08:00.345
and they believe certain things about the divine.

150
00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:03.225
How do we know that? How do they know that?

151
00:08:03.725 --> 00:08:08.265
How do, how do humans know about that? Sorry?

152
00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:09.985
Creation. Creation.

153
00:08:11.765 --> 00:08:14.865
So Romans one tells us, Romans chapter one says

154
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.385
that when we just look at the creation, also, lots

155
00:08:18.385 --> 00:08:20.625
of the Psalms talk about this on 1 0 4.

156
00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:24.425
Uh, that when we look at the creation,

157
00:08:25.045 --> 00:08:27.905
we can deduce certain things about God.

158
00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:31.425
So what are some things we can deduce about creation?

159
00:08:31.525 --> 00:08:35.065
By the way, this is a fancy theological term called

160
00:08:35.495 --> 00:08:36.785
general revelation.

161
00:08:37.335 --> 00:08:38.545
Okay? So

162
00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:42.385
what we know in general about God from stuff he's done.

163
00:08:43.405 --> 00:08:46.425
So what are some things we can know about God

164
00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:49.185
through what's called general revelation or creation?

165
00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:54.995
Order? Order. Things are well ordered. Okay?

166
00:08:55.545 --> 00:08:57.485
So sometimes I'll be debating with like,

167
00:08:57.485 --> 00:08:58.605
really smart atheists,

168
00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:03.245
and they say, well, what is some proof that God

169
00:09:03.865 --> 00:09:06.445
has designed things with, with great precision?

170
00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.085
And I said, okay, take a look at the moon.

171
00:09:09.195 --> 00:09:10.285
Take a look at the sun.

172
00:09:11.515 --> 00:09:15.045
They're exactly the same size from our perspective on earth.

173
00:09:15.985 --> 00:09:17.565
The moon is a certain distance.

174
00:09:17.745 --> 00:09:19.725
The sun is 400 times farther,

175
00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:22.325
and it's exactly 400 times larger.

176
00:09:23.825 --> 00:09:25.965
And they're a perfect alignment so

177
00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.125
that the moon covers the sun.

178
00:09:28.545 --> 00:09:32.285
So we can see a thing called the aurora of the sun.

179
00:09:33.885 --> 00:09:36.415
What are the odds of that happening by chance?

180
00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:39.735
You see what I'm saying? So there's order. Good. What else?

181
00:09:40.075 --> 00:09:42.295
How else do we know about? What else can we know about God?

182
00:09:43.235 --> 00:09:44.775
Beauty. Beauty?

183
00:09:45.645 --> 00:09:49.495
Okay, we can go about, man, that's, that's pretty.

184
00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:53.095
I remember one time David Barnes was telling me a story

185
00:09:53.095 --> 00:09:56.295
about he was talking to a kid camp, pardon me, David,

186
00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:58.855
if I'm treading on your stories.

187
00:09:59.755 --> 00:10:02.175
He was talking to a kid at camp that he was witnessing to,

188
00:10:02.175 --> 00:10:04.735
and the kid was like, yeah, I don't believe in God.

189
00:10:04.775 --> 00:10:05.855
I don't believe any, any of that. And

190
00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:07.055
they happened to be on a beach.

191
00:10:07.755 --> 00:10:09.615
And David goes, look at this beach.

192
00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:12.295
And the kid stared at for her,

193
00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:13.415
he goes, okay, I believe in God.

194
00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:19.055
Okay, so beauty, what else? Provision.

195
00:10:19.605 --> 00:10:22.775
Provision. We got, we got stuff to eat.

196
00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:27.935
You know, I mean, all creatures are in this kind of harmony

197
00:10:27.985 --> 00:10:30.255
where they're all eating each other, eating plants.

198
00:10:30.355 --> 00:10:33.895
And we got all this teaming life compared to, I don't know,

199
00:10:33.895 --> 00:10:36.215
say the moon, which is, you know, isn't working out for it.

200
00:10:37.195 --> 00:10:40.895
Um, what else? Power. Power.

201
00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:46.655
Got a lot of power. Solar power, got wind, power, got water,

202
00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:48.535
power, thunder, tornadoes.

203
00:10:48.595 --> 00:10:52.055
You ever heard of those in Oklahoma? Uh, what else?

204
00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:55.055
Creativity. Creativity.

205
00:10:57.275 --> 00:11:01.975
Um, I read a, a poet who was a, also a theologian,

206
00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:04.335
and she made this great statement.

207
00:11:04.355 --> 00:11:05.815
She said, at the moment in Genesis,

208
00:11:07.485 --> 00:11:11.935
when it says God made humans in God's image, right?

209
00:11:11.935 --> 00:11:14.735
Right at the beginning she said, at that point,

210
00:11:14.805 --> 00:11:15.975
what do we know about God?

211
00:11:16.725 --> 00:11:20.295
He's the creation. So human beings themselves

212
00:11:21.335 --> 00:11:25.375
innately have this creation, this power to create.

213
00:11:25.405 --> 00:11:29.615
What else? Attention to detail. Attention to details.

214
00:11:30.405 --> 00:11:35.295
Okay? Uh, you know, there's a great moment in the,

215
00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:37.175
the movie, Rudy, anybody ever seen Rudy?

216
00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:39.535
Yes. Where the priest looks at Rudy,

217
00:11:39.555 --> 00:11:40.815
and this says, I know two things.

218
00:11:40.945 --> 00:11:43.455
There is a God and I'm not him. Okay?

219
00:11:44.115 --> 00:11:46.335
You look around and you go, Psalm, bigger

220
00:11:46.395 --> 00:11:49.095
and smarter than me made this stuff right?

221
00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:55.205
Okay? So we can know a lot about God

222
00:11:56.155 --> 00:11:57.965
through what's called general revelation.

223
00:11:58.085 --> 00:11:59.405
I keep just looking around at stuff,

224
00:12:00.985 --> 00:12:03.245
but now we're talking about the Bible.

225
00:12:05.075 --> 00:12:08.405
What might we know from the Bible about God?

226
00:12:09.235 --> 00:12:13.125
That we wouldn't learn from creation?

227
00:12:13.505 --> 00:12:15.045
By the way, uh, the,

228
00:12:15.305 --> 00:12:18.525
the Bible when we're talking about it is called, uh,

229
00:12:18.755 --> 00:12:21.325
special revelation, which is a fancy way

230
00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:22.765
to send of the Bible, right?

231
00:12:24.185 --> 00:12:26.845
So what do we know about God,

232
00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:29.725
uh, from the Bible?

233
00:12:30.595 --> 00:12:35.045
That, that we, you know, that's additional to

234
00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:36.205
what we know from creation.

235
00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:41.365
He loves people a lot, loves people enough to die, right?

236
00:12:42.115 --> 00:12:43.205
Okay. That's,

237
00:12:43.205 --> 00:12:44.925
that's not something you see when you look at

238
00:12:44.955 --> 00:12:46.405
Jupiter, right?

239
00:12:47.135 --> 00:12:48.645
Right. What else?

240
00:12:52.395 --> 00:12:55.965
What other things? He has a grand, a grand story.

241
00:12:56.505 --> 00:12:57.805
He has a grand story.

242
00:12:59.185 --> 00:13:02.325
He is invested himself in human history.

243
00:13:03.225 --> 00:13:05.605
And I made a little chart up here, and, uh, it's perfect

244
00:13:05.605 --> 00:13:07.525
because, uh, university,

245
00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:09.605
we don't have markers that work very well.

246
00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:13.205
And so I pick ones that don't work very well, tr

247
00:13:13.305 --> 00:13:15.205
of course came up and picked the perfect one.

248
00:13:15.905 --> 00:13:19.645
But, uh, if we think about, uh, a,

249
00:13:19.805 --> 00:13:23.525
a grand history here, the Old Testament was written

250
00:13:24.215 --> 00:13:25.845
about a thousand year period,

251
00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:28.005
and I'm just fudging some of these numbers.

252
00:13:28.005 --> 00:13:29.605
Sometimes they're gonna be a century off.

253
00:13:29.605 --> 00:13:31.445
Sometimes they're gonna be a decade or two off.

254
00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:36.445
'cause scholars disagree. But about 1450 BC when Moses was

255
00:13:36.445 --> 00:13:40.365
bopping around to about 450 BC is when the Old

256
00:13:40.605 --> 00:13:41.725
Testament was written, okay?

257
00:13:43.555 --> 00:13:45.525
Then from about four 50 BC

258
00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:48.485
to about four BC is called the inter testim period.

259
00:13:49.105 --> 00:13:50.765
So the Old Testament's already ended.

260
00:13:51.415 --> 00:13:52.485
Stuff is happening,

261
00:13:52.545 --> 00:13:55.285
but there's no more writing in the, in in the Bible,

262
00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:56.765
the, in the camp, right?

263
00:13:57.995 --> 00:14:00.445
Then we had the New Testament written over a period

264
00:14:00.445 --> 00:14:01.925
of about 94 years

265
00:14:02.065 --> 00:14:07.005
or so from four BC when Jesus, about the time Jesus was born

266
00:14:07.465 --> 00:14:09.645
to about the time the Apostle John dies,

267
00:14:10.135 --> 00:14:12.165
which is about 90 or to 180.

268
00:14:14.035 --> 00:14:16.165
Then we have the early church.

269
00:14:17.385 --> 00:14:19.805
And I designated that from about 90 ad

270
00:14:19.865 --> 00:14:22.565
to 4 76 ad I picked 4 76.

271
00:14:22.845 --> 00:14:24.285
'cause that's when the Roman Empire fell.

272
00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:29.165
And then we have about a thousand years of

273
00:14:29.165 --> 00:14:30.365
what I call middle ages.

274
00:14:30.365 --> 00:14:32.685
And I'm gonna refer to those as the Catholic Middle Ages.

275
00:14:32.885 --> 00:14:34.445
'cause it was really only one church

276
00:14:35.025 --> 00:14:37.685
in Western Europe in the Middle Ages.

277
00:14:37.685 --> 00:14:39.125
And it was the Catholic church.

278
00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:42.805
And partly because they were awesome, but probably

279
00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:44.125
'cause they wouldn't have it any other way.

280
00:14:44.145 --> 00:14:47.685
If there were cults or sex, they, they eliminated. Right?

281
00:14:49.025 --> 00:14:52.845
And then starting with the 1517, we have the beginning of

282
00:14:52.845 --> 00:14:54.205
what are called the Protestants.

283
00:14:55.105 --> 00:14:56.845
And, uh, what are the Protestants says,

284
00:14:56.985 --> 00:14:59.565
as Mark said last week, they're protesting

285
00:15:00.715 --> 00:15:02.485
what they consider the abuses

286
00:15:02.675 --> 00:15:04.365
that the Catholic church had developed

287
00:15:04.365 --> 00:15:05.445
over that thousand years.

288
00:15:07.505 --> 00:15:10.405
And they want to go back to the Bible, okay?

289
00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:15.125
And they want to their religion to reflect more like

290
00:15:15.125 --> 00:15:16.685
what they see in the first century in the

291
00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:17.765
Book of Acts and so on.

292
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:22.005
Okay? And our church is part of

293
00:15:22.075 --> 00:15:23.525
that Protestant tradition.

294
00:15:23.585 --> 00:15:27.045
But notice how God has interweaved

295
00:15:27.555 --> 00:15:29.845
himself throughout human history.

296
00:15:30.765 --> 00:15:33.605
I mean, from Adam to Abraham, to Moses.

297
00:15:33.905 --> 00:15:36.685
He just will say, Moses, write this down here.

298
00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:38.125
I'll write the first part of it. Okay?

299
00:15:38.155 --> 00:15:40.245
It's called the Bible. Now I want you

300
00:15:40.245 --> 00:15:41.325
to write the rest of it down.

301
00:15:41.395 --> 00:15:44.085
Okay? And so he's interactive.

302
00:15:44.085 --> 00:15:47.525
What else do we know about God from the Bible?

303
00:15:47.985 --> 00:15:51.645
His essence, or who he is, is his essence, who he is.

304
00:15:52.465 --> 00:15:55.405
So we've got a bunch of Latin theological terms like

305
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:58.445
omniscient, immortal, infinite, okay?

306
00:15:59.315 --> 00:16:02.405
Omnipresent. And those words aren't in the Bible,

307
00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:04.765
but the God of the Bible is those things.

308
00:16:06.025 --> 00:16:09.405
And so he's, he really is bigger than us. Okay?

309
00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:15.085
And so those are the two kinds of revelation.

310
00:16:15.635 --> 00:16:17.205
General, special.

311
00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:23.085
Now, the next question is, if the Bible

312
00:16:24.405 --> 00:16:27.565
a special revelation, I'm gonna call it the word of God.

313
00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:30.605
Some reason why I say the word of God, I wanna go

314
00:16:30.605 --> 00:16:32.245
to Sean Cony, right?

315
00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:34.325
The water of God, right?

316
00:16:35.425 --> 00:16:38.245
Uh, why I'm gonna do everything of Sean.

317
00:16:39.545 --> 00:16:43.405
Um, so I thought David Barbon

318
00:16:43.405 --> 00:16:44.485
was gonna come up and take the mic.

319
00:16:46.985 --> 00:16:51.565
So when we're thinking about the word of God, uh,

320
00:16:51.665 --> 00:16:55.525
the question is who interprets it?

321
00:16:57.065 --> 00:17:01.165
So for the Catholic Middle Ages for a thousand years,

322
00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:06.405
they came to the conclusion that the only group

323
00:17:06.555 --> 00:17:09.525
that can properly interpret the Bible

324
00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:11.965
is the Catholic church.

325
00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:17.885
Okay? And they can interpret the Bible, uh, by the way,

326
00:17:18.065 --> 00:17:21.445
for them, for Catholic, and I, I love Catholics

327
00:17:21.445 --> 00:17:23.525
and my, my daughter and son-in-law are about

328
00:17:23.805 --> 00:17:24.845
Catholics and my grandson.

329
00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:27.565
But we're different, right?

330
00:17:27.665 --> 00:17:29.205
And we gotta know what the differences are.

331
00:17:29.825 --> 00:17:31.965
Uh, Catholics have

332
00:17:32.265 --> 00:17:35.285
as their absolute central authority for their religion.

333
00:17:36.425 --> 00:17:40.925
Not the Bible. Protestants, it's the Bible.

334
00:17:40.955 --> 00:17:44.125
It's called sola scripture. Another fancy Latin term, right?

335
00:17:45.275 --> 00:17:50.085
Sola scripture. But the Catholics hold that the authority

336
00:17:51.145 --> 00:17:53.765
for the, for their religion is the church.

337
00:17:55.665 --> 00:17:58.645
And that includes things like pub pronouncements of pubs,

338
00:17:58.645 --> 00:18:01.125
but mainly church councils and so on, right?

339
00:18:02.225 --> 00:18:04.645
And so when there's a Bible passage, the

340
00:18:05.205 --> 00:18:06.485
Catholics will interpret that

341
00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:08.085
and say, this is what it means.

342
00:18:08.185 --> 00:18:11.085
And the Catholics are supposed to believe it that way.

343
00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:15.965
Does that make sense? Now, in 1517,

344
00:18:16.425 --> 00:18:17.605
we began, uh,

345
00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:20.685
a guy named Martin Luther began what's called the

346
00:18:20.685 --> 00:18:21.765
Protestant Reformation.

347
00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:26.285
And they came up with some concepts, which

348
00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:31.765
basically leaves it up to the individual Christian

349
00:18:32.425 --> 00:18:33.805
to interpret scripture.

350
00:18:35.225 --> 00:18:38.245
Um, and one, as I said, so scripture,

351
00:18:38.775 --> 00:18:41.565
which means the Bible is the supreme authority in all

352
00:18:41.565 --> 00:18:43.125
matters of doctrine and practice.

353
00:18:44.585 --> 00:18:47.005
And the other is the priesthood of the believer.

354
00:18:48.305 --> 00:18:51.085
So, uh, I'm a Catholic, I might say,

355
00:18:51.085 --> 00:18:53.005
I don't understand this scripture passage.

356
00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:54.765
And the priest may say it means this

357
00:18:54.765 --> 00:18:57.485
because that's the tradition handed down.

358
00:18:58.515 --> 00:19:01.885
What we're on our own is Protestants except

359
00:19:01.885 --> 00:19:03.845
for the Holy Spirit, which is really helpful.

360
00:19:04.555 --> 00:19:07.405
Okay? So it is our job.

361
00:19:07.475 --> 00:19:11.005
There's no one between us and God Almighty,

362
00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:12.725
but the Holy Spirit.

363
00:19:12.905 --> 00:19:14.805
And that is enough 'cause for Christians,

364
00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:16.925
the Holy Spirit's living inside us.

365
00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:19.925
And it is the Holy Spirit who helps us

366
00:19:20.475 --> 00:19:23.525
interpret the scripture, which the Holy Spirit

367
00:19:24.145 --> 00:19:25.925
helped people write.

368
00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:30.645
So that's a pretty good means to understand the book,

369
00:19:30.675 --> 00:19:32.325
that the Holy Spirit inspired people.

370
00:19:34.305 --> 00:19:37.045
Um, so the next question is

371
00:19:37.465 --> 00:19:39.965
how do we interpret the scripture?

372
00:19:41.115 --> 00:19:42.965
Well, we're gonna be talking about that next week.

373
00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:48.005
That's got to do with goggles looking at the sun, okay?

374
00:19:48.745 --> 00:19:51.205
Uh, and that's called hermeneutics.

375
00:19:51.205 --> 00:19:53.085
Not to be confused with Herman Munster

376
00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:54.965
at a certain age, okay?

377
00:19:55.825 --> 00:19:56.885
Uh, no one's my age.

378
00:19:59.545 --> 00:20:03.525
So at the bottom it says, within the reformation

379
00:20:03.865 --> 00:20:06.285
and within theological planners, prior to it,

380
00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:09.125
a movement called reform theology,

381
00:20:09.155 --> 00:20:10.805
sometimes covenant theology.

382
00:20:11.075 --> 00:20:12.125
This is the bottom of paper.

383
00:20:12.185 --> 00:20:15.925
One that we have in there, emphasizes the authority

384
00:20:15.925 --> 00:20:19.405
of scripture, the sovereignty of God, salvation by grace

385
00:20:19.405 --> 00:20:21.885
through Christ, the necessity of evangelism.

386
00:20:22.585 --> 00:20:25.165
And we at Henderson Hills are a part of

387
00:20:25.165 --> 00:20:27.085
that reform theology tradition.

388
00:20:28.545 --> 00:20:31.845
And so the systematic theology course will view the Bible

389
00:20:32.035 --> 00:20:34.645
from that theological perspective.

390
00:20:35.505 --> 00:20:37.925
Our assumptions, number one, the Bible is true,

391
00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:40.605
and our is our only absolute standard of truth.

392
00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:46.005
Sola scripture, uh, the God of the Bible exists

393
00:20:46.185 --> 00:20:47.765
and is who the Bible says he is.

394
00:20:50.185 --> 00:20:53.165
And we will teach from a reform theological perspective.

395
00:20:53.215 --> 00:20:54.885
We're gonna kick around the idea later.

396
00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:56.205
A thing called narcy.

397
00:20:56.425 --> 00:20:58.245
I'm not sure when will do that, maybe today.

398
00:20:59.105 --> 00:21:01.405
Um, but let's go back to

399
00:21:03.505 --> 00:21:04.965
the question of the Bible.

400
00:21:07.185 --> 00:21:10.245
So what is the Bible?

401
00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:13.245
If I brought in a copy of the new of pardon

402
00:21:13.265 --> 00:21:15.205
of the Living Bible, which was the kind

403
00:21:15.205 --> 00:21:18.245
of hippie hipster bible right from the sixties.

404
00:21:18.515 --> 00:21:19.925
Okay? You know, I've read part of that.

405
00:21:21.345 --> 00:21:25.525
Uh, this is a quote from Ecclesiastes nine eight,

406
00:21:26.835 --> 00:21:30.765
from the Living Bible, wear fine clothes

407
00:21:31.715 --> 00:21:33.405
with a dash, a colo.

408
00:21:37.545 --> 00:21:40.005
Now in the King James, it says, anoint your head with oil.

409
00:21:41.755 --> 00:21:45.085
Okay? But the living

410
00:21:46.185 --> 00:21:50.125
or the dash, I probably could use a little poem.

411
00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:56.485
My life. Um, so is the Living Bible.

412
00:21:56.625 --> 00:22:01.085
The Bible is is ESB, the Bible.

413
00:22:02.425 --> 00:22:05.405
The King James. King James. King James. Yeah.

414
00:22:06.115 --> 00:22:08.765
When I was a kid, I heard, by the way, when I was a kid,

415
00:22:08.885 --> 00:22:10.965
I was given a King James Bible by the,

416
00:22:11.025 --> 00:22:12.725
the Baptist church that I was going to.

417
00:22:13.745 --> 00:22:16.325
And uh, I said, oh, is this the Bible?

418
00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:17.925
And someone out wrote, there were joking.

419
00:22:17.925 --> 00:22:18.965
They said, if it's good enough

420
00:22:18.965 --> 00:22:20.565
for Jesus, it's good enough for us.

421
00:22:21.625 --> 00:22:25.845
The okay. Uh, so what is the Bible?

422
00:22:26.105 --> 00:22:29.325
Is it, is it new standard update? I like that one.

423
00:22:30.645 --> 00:22:33.825
I like the new living. Um,

424
00:22:34.705 --> 00:22:35.905
I like the English version

425
00:22:36.015 --> 00:22:38.905
with all the notes in the E You know that with the EE

426
00:22:39.615 --> 00:22:41.105
What about the Swahili version?

427
00:22:41.455 --> 00:22:43.105
Yeah. What about the Swahili version?

428
00:22:43.485 --> 00:22:45.145
You know, I do mission work in Wales

429
00:22:45.245 --> 00:22:47.985
and they have a Welsh Bible, and sometimes I open it up

430
00:22:47.985 --> 00:22:49.385
and I'm as confused as I amm

431
00:22:49.385 --> 00:22:51.105
because still trying to learn Welsh,

432
00:22:51.105 --> 00:22:54.145
after, you know, 15 years, we even seriously,

433
00:22:54.145 --> 00:22:55.425
like the Ethiopian Bible,

434
00:22:55.525 --> 00:22:57.745
it has a million other books in it.

435
00:22:57.935 --> 00:22:58.945
Okay, we'll talk about that.

436
00:22:58.975 --> 00:23:00.265
Yeah, we're gonna talk about that later.

437
00:23:01.165 --> 00:23:02.305
So what is the Bible?

438
00:23:03.095 --> 00:23:04.865
Well, John one isn't

439
00:23:05.485 --> 00:23:09.265
the word, okay?

440
00:23:09.525 --> 00:23:12.945
So at one level the word is Jesus Christ

441
00:23:12.945 --> 00:23:14.625
himself, right?

442
00:23:15.135 --> 00:23:17.665
Because John is using a euphemism

443
00:23:18.005 --> 00:23:20.225
for Jesus Christs, okay?

444
00:23:20.925 --> 00:23:23.505
And so we have to believe that the word

445
00:23:24.055 --> 00:23:27.825
that is the second person of the Trinity is absolutely

446
00:23:28.465 --> 00:23:31.305
manifested in, uh, a book that we might hold.

447
00:23:31.365 --> 00:23:35.185
So I'll pull out the one that I tend to bring to church.

448
00:23:35.255 --> 00:23:36.345
This is the ESP.

449
00:23:36.605 --> 00:23:40.185
We have to believe that, uh, Jesus is in this,

450
00:23:40.245 --> 00:23:43.145
in his essence, by the Holy Spirit,

451
00:23:43.245 --> 00:23:44.625
but also the Father, right?

452
00:23:45.785 --> 00:23:48.725
But when I talk about the word, let's talk about a term

453
00:23:49.665 --> 00:23:50.765
called the cannon.

454
00:23:51.345 --> 00:23:53.845
And I don't mean yare parent, that's take the kind

455
00:23:54.795 --> 00:23:55.885
s**t that SME in.

456
00:23:56.625 --> 00:23:58.725
I'm talking about C-A-N-O-N.

457
00:23:59.945 --> 00:24:01.965
And uh, basically it just means

458
00:24:03.305 --> 00:24:07.445
the books in this thing uphold divided into Old Testament

459
00:24:07.445 --> 00:24:08.805
and New Testament, 66.

460
00:24:10.225 --> 00:24:14.965
Um, so the canon, what

461
00:24:16.265 --> 00:24:17.605
is the canon?

462
00:24:19.065 --> 00:24:23.245
How do we know what the Bible is? What is it?

463
00:24:25.195 --> 00:24:26.645
Anybody inspired Word of God?

464
00:24:27.075 --> 00:24:28.965
Okay, inspired word of God, he said

465
00:24:29.025 --> 00:24:30.925
as I almost slammed those by word of God.

466
00:24:30.925 --> 00:24:33.645
Yeah, okay. That's the inspired word of God.

467
00:24:34.265 --> 00:24:35.445
But how do we define it?

468
00:24:35.445 --> 00:24:39.045
Because for example, as we're gonna see, uh,

469
00:24:39.185 --> 00:24:43.205
do you know there are books that the Bible mentions

470
00:24:44.755 --> 00:24:47.405
that we don't have anymore 17 of them.

471
00:24:48.825 --> 00:24:51.965
Do you know the Catholics have a bunch more books

472
00:24:51.965 --> 00:24:53.005
in the Bible than we do?

473
00:24:54.665 --> 00:24:58.325
Do you know, there's hundreds of other scriptures out there

474
00:24:59.715 --> 00:25:01.605
that don't make either of those cuts.

475
00:25:02.595 --> 00:25:06.525
Okay? So how do we define the Bible?

476
00:25:06.785 --> 00:25:08.565
How do we know where it comes from?

477
00:25:10.465 --> 00:25:14.325
Let me, uh, make a suggestion for you.

478
00:25:14.475 --> 00:25:16.445
This is just my take, okay?

479
00:25:17.525 --> 00:25:21.485
I would argue that the original Hebrew arama

480
00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:24.085
and Greek manuscripts, the autographs

481
00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:28.165
of the original author, uh, is the Bible.

482
00:25:29.305 --> 00:25:34.005
So when Paul dictated to whoever so glad,

483
00:25:34.145 --> 00:25:35.485
and Savannah said, which St.

484
00:25:35.485 --> 00:25:38.405
Paul, uh, when John wrote stuff down,

485
00:25:38.405 --> 00:25:41.125
when Luke wrote stuff down, uh,

486
00:25:41.515 --> 00:25:44.045
When God wrote stuff down and handed it to Moses,

487
00:25:44.185 --> 00:25:47.965
and then he, God dictated to Moses that moment

488
00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:50.525
was the Bible in three different languages.

489
00:25:51.025 --> 00:25:54.565
In the Old Testament is Hebrew, their passages of Daniel

490
00:25:54.595 --> 00:25:55.965
that are an Aramaic, I think,

491
00:25:56.585 --> 00:25:59.205
and then also in the New Testament is Greek, okay?

492
00:25:59.785 --> 00:26:02.885
So to me, those are capital B Bible.

493
00:26:03.065 --> 00:26:04.925
But the good news is, is

494
00:26:04.925 --> 00:26:07.045
that the translations we have in the Bible

495
00:26:07.625 --> 00:26:10.965
are basically great for everyday use and,

496
00:26:10.985 --> 00:26:12.445
and for spiritual enlightenment.

497
00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:15.365
But it's awfully fun to look back at the Hebrew,

498
00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:16.725
the Greek and the Aramaic.

499
00:26:16.725 --> 00:26:17.925
I don't know Aramaic and I dunno,

500
00:26:17.925 --> 00:26:19.125
Hebrew, but you see what I'm saying?

501
00:26:19.145 --> 00:26:21.085
Mm-hmm. Is that, that's, that's

502
00:26:21.105 --> 00:26:22.105
The, the idea.

503
00:26:22.945 --> 00:26:26.405
But let's jump into some of these other scriptures.

504
00:26:27.345 --> 00:26:30.485
And as I said, the Old Testament was written

505
00:26:31.235 --> 00:26:35.685
from about 1450 to about four 50 ad okay?

506
00:26:37.425 --> 00:26:42.045
Uh, I mean BC yes, but Jesus comes along about four bcs.

507
00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:47.445
So what was the Old Testament for Jesus?

508
00:26:48.865 --> 00:26:53.325
The answer is, it's exactly the same Old Testament we have

509
00:26:53.325 --> 00:26:54.365
in our Protestant Bible.

510
00:26:56.545 --> 00:27:01.365
It was sort of codified about 200 bc.

511
00:27:02.065 --> 00:27:03.845
So almost 200 years

512
00:27:03.865 --> 00:27:06.405
before Jesus, it was unofficially codified.

513
00:27:07.185 --> 00:27:09.005
That's what we know, what Jesus read.

514
00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:11.645
And then about 90 ad

515
00:27:12.095 --> 00:27:16.885
after, you know, John, while John, uh, apostle John was,

516
00:27:16.985 --> 00:27:19.605
was dying somewhere, probably, uh,

517
00:27:19.655 --> 00:27:21.885
there was a synagogue called Jam

518
00:27:22.185 --> 00:27:24.805
or Jamian, where the Jews officially said,

519
00:27:24.805 --> 00:27:29.605
this is the Old Testament, but it's exactly what Jesus had.

520
00:27:31.345 --> 00:27:33.445
So what about all the scriptures

521
00:27:34.315 --> 00:27:38.885
that were written in this time that isn't in the canon?

522
00:27:39.585 --> 00:27:43.205
And what about the scriptures in the intestinal period

523
00:27:44.075 --> 00:27:45.405
that isn't in the canon?

524
00:27:46.545 --> 00:27:48.205
How do we know they're not?

525
00:27:48.395 --> 00:27:52.365
Well, that is called the Catholic Apal.

526
00:27:53.385 --> 00:27:57.365
And I brought an old copy of one of my Bibles with Roy

527
00:27:57.405 --> 00:27:58.645
and it, I'm gonna hand this around.

528
00:27:58.645 --> 00:28:01.445
And where the bookmark is, that is

529
00:28:01.445 --> 00:28:02.565
where the apocrypha starts.

530
00:28:02.715 --> 00:28:04.765
It's not very far, okay?

531
00:28:05.265 --> 00:28:07.645
But you can take a look at some of the scriptures in there.

532
00:28:07.835 --> 00:28:10.165
There's the wisdom of solving, okay?

533
00:28:10.825 --> 00:28:13.005
Uh, when I was in college, I was,

534
00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:14.885
I was a Christian when I became 11,

535
00:28:14.945 --> 00:28:16.885
but I got, you know, thinking about this stuff

536
00:28:16.885 --> 00:28:19.525
and I decided to read every word of the Catholicism.

537
00:28:20.185 --> 00:28:22.525
Uh, and then I started reading a bunch of the other stuff.

538
00:28:22.525 --> 00:28:23.645
We'll talk about that in a minute.

539
00:28:24.545 --> 00:28:26.645
So what about all the Catholic apoc?

540
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:31.005
But what happened was, it was a really smart early church

541
00:28:32.115 --> 00:28:37.045
thinker, and, uh, he,

542
00:28:37.105 --> 00:28:42.005
uh, sorry, I'm blanking out for a second.

543
00:28:44.065 --> 00:28:48.645
So what he did was, uh, he decided

544
00:28:48.905 --> 00:28:52.925
to translate the Bible into Latin.

545
00:28:53.185 --> 00:28:55.085
His name was Jerome, okay?

546
00:28:56.385 --> 00:28:58.365
And he translated the Bible into Latin,

547
00:28:58.505 --> 00:29:00.525
and that was the big hit Bible for,

548
00:29:00.665 --> 00:29:01.685
you know, a thousand years.

549
00:29:02.195 --> 00:29:06.925
Okay? And what he did was, is he said, this is the Bible

550
00:29:08.275 --> 00:29:11.045
exactly the same as the Protestant pan,

551
00:29:11.825 --> 00:29:16.005
but in the back, he said, for additional reading, okay?

552
00:29:17.025 --> 00:29:20.045
And he said, this isn't scripture, but it's in the back.

553
00:29:20.115 --> 00:29:22.045
It's the apora for additional reading.

554
00:29:22.065 --> 00:29:24.285
And it's good reading. I, I don't have a problem reading the

555
00:29:24.415 --> 00:29:28.085
Apora, but what happened was Jerome said,

556
00:29:28.085 --> 00:29:30.725
it's not scripture, but later on, the Catholic said, yeah,

557
00:29:30.755 --> 00:29:34.725
it's so, in a way it's not so much

558
00:29:34.915 --> 00:29:39.485
that Protestants took away scripture from the Bible, it's

559
00:29:39.485 --> 00:29:40.685
that the Catholics added it.

560
00:29:40.995 --> 00:29:43.125
Does that make sense? And

561
00:29:43.125 --> 00:29:44.325
there's a lot of good stuff in there.

562
00:29:44.325 --> 00:29:46.605
Wisdom of song. Now, two funny ones are,

563
00:29:46.955 --> 00:29:51.565
they're further adventures of Daniel the prophet, okay?

564
00:29:52.425 --> 00:29:54.965
And basically Daniel becomes Sherlock Holmes,

565
00:29:56.185 --> 00:29:58.285
and he is solving these really cool mysteries,

566
00:29:58.305 --> 00:29:59.565
and they're great to read.

567
00:29:59.715 --> 00:30:01.445
Okay? I don't believe them, you know, but,

568
00:30:01.905 --> 00:30:03.125
but they're, they're really awesome.

569
00:30:03.345 --> 00:30:04.965
One involves a dragon, okay?

570
00:30:05.985 --> 00:30:09.245
So, uh, and one kind of starts the concept

571
00:30:09.425 --> 00:30:12.365
of cross-examination, but enough of that.

572
00:30:12.585 --> 00:30:15.565
So I, I read 'em all if you want read the, uh,

573
00:30:15.925 --> 00:30:17.165
Catholic apra fine.

574
00:30:17.755 --> 00:30:19.845
It's, it's a lot of, it's, you know, pretty good reading.

575
00:30:20.465 --> 00:30:23.405
Is it in there Scripture? No. How do we know?

576
00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:25.125
Well, here's a, I'm gonna give you a lot

577
00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:27.085
of clues later why it's not.

578
00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:28.965
But here's a good clue.

579
00:30:31.235 --> 00:30:33.205
It's good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for us.

580
00:30:34.635 --> 00:30:36.045
None of the Catholic talk

581
00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:38.805
was in the Old Testament that Jesus wrote.

582
00:30:39.675 --> 00:30:41.685
Okay, here's another answer.

583
00:30:42.895 --> 00:30:46.805
Jesus never refers to the Catholic apocrypha one time,

584
00:30:47.925 --> 00:30:50.865
nor does any other writer of the New Testament.

585
00:30:51.935 --> 00:30:55.105
Okay? So good for additional reading.

586
00:30:55.765 --> 00:30:59.225
But again, if the, what we have here is good enough

587
00:30:59.225 --> 00:31:01.745
for Jesus, the Old Testament, it's good enough for us.

588
00:31:01.765 --> 00:31:05.505
And we got, I got more about that later. Okay?

589
00:31:07.255 --> 00:31:08.585
What about the New Testament?

590
00:31:10.565 --> 00:31:12.785
By the way, there's some really good stuff in the

591
00:31:12.785 --> 00:31:14.065
Inner Testament stuff.

592
00:31:14.645 --> 00:31:16.545
So have you ever heard, I love this name,

593
00:31:16.615 --> 00:31:18.745
it's a Jewish name, but it sounds Scottish to me.

594
00:31:18.745 --> 00:31:20.185
You ever heard of the Maccabees?

595
00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:23.345
Our schools, they sound Scottish.

596
00:31:23.365 --> 00:31:27.025
Uh, well, all about the Maccabees are there and I've read it

597
00:31:27.025 --> 00:31:28.545
and it's good swashbuckling stuff,

598
00:31:28.545 --> 00:31:31.785
and it's where we get Hanukkah okay,

599
00:31:32.335 --> 00:31:33.625
that, that comes in that.

600
00:31:33.865 --> 00:31:36.625
I hope I didn't mispronounce that. Okay.

601
00:31:37.805 --> 00:31:40.865
Um, is this all boring stuff of this stuff? You guys know?

602
00:31:41.175 --> 00:31:45.025
Okay, the board, the elders are board, okay, I got question.

603
00:31:45.315 --> 00:31:49.905
Sorry. That's the one to, is that the first five? Yes.

604
00:31:50.615 --> 00:31:55.425
Tora is the, uh, sort of Old Testament, a Jewish notion

605
00:31:55.445 --> 00:31:57.185
of just the first five books in the Bible.

606
00:31:57.925 --> 00:32:00.665
The, uh, when the Jews are,

607
00:32:00.725 --> 00:32:03.905
or Jesus, when he fought about the Old Testament,

608
00:32:03.925 --> 00:32:06.025
he broke it up into three parts.

609
00:32:07.085 --> 00:32:11.585
It was the law, which is the Torah, the five books,

610
00:32:11.845 --> 00:32:13.985
the prophets, which is the prophets.

611
00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:16.825
And then for some reason, the other bit is the writings,

612
00:32:16.995 --> 00:32:19.215
which is, you know, Proverbs and,

613
00:32:19.795 --> 00:32:21.135
and all, all that sort of stuff.

614
00:32:21.325 --> 00:32:24.775
Okay? Um, that's how, that's how they, they broke it up,

615
00:32:24.775 --> 00:32:28.615
the Jews and Jesus Does that, did that answer your question?

616
00:32:28.805 --> 00:32:32.335
Okay. Okay. Uh, any other questions?

617
00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:34.455
I guess I don't know how much time, just real quick. Yeah.

618
00:32:34.475 --> 00:32:37.535
You mentioned that Jesus, um, never,

619
00:32:39.435 --> 00:32:40.885
Like you said, it is that Jesus

620
00:32:42.065 --> 00:32:43.805
of course never mentions the apocryphal,

621
00:32:44.705 --> 00:32:46.965
but do we have evidence that Jesus

622
00:32:48.645 --> 00:32:50.925
referenced every other aspect of real testament?

623
00:32:51.545 --> 00:32:54.805
Yes. He mentioned every book of the Bible

624
00:32:55.625 --> 00:32:57.845
except four of them.

625
00:32:58.945 --> 00:33:02.725
And Esther, now that doesn't mean anything against him

626
00:33:02.725 --> 00:33:06.045
because he was just talking about stuff, so he didn't have

627
00:33:06.045 --> 00:33:07.885
to be categorical and mention all of them,

628
00:33:08.545 --> 00:33:10.445
but he's mentioned all of them,

629
00:33:10.665 --> 00:33:13.125
but four of them, I have them somewhere in my notes here.

630
00:33:14.265 --> 00:33:18.085
Um, but all the other Old Testament, he,

631
00:33:18.185 --> 00:33:19.205
he directly mentions

632
00:33:19.265 --> 00:33:22.605
and the other apostles mentioned a along those two

633
00:33:22.835 --> 00:33:24.605
From the Lord to May, it says Jesus

634
00:33:24.675 --> 00:33:27.885
through the scripture Psalm yes, prophet

635
00:33:28.355 --> 00:33:31.725
That again, On the road to May,

636
00:33:31.725 --> 00:33:34.685
which is in the last chapter of Luke, uh, Jesus,

637
00:33:34.945 --> 00:33:38.285
it says he start, he went into the scripture beginning

638
00:33:38.315 --> 00:33:40.925
with Moses, the Psalms, and the prophets,

639
00:33:41.625 --> 00:33:44.645
and talking about all things concerning himself.

640
00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:50.245
You had mentioned in specific He had, he went

641
00:33:50.245 --> 00:33:51.405
through an open scriptures,

642
00:33:51.705 --> 00:33:53.005
By the way, Jesus himself,

643
00:33:53.025 --> 00:33:55.005
and it's somewhere in here, uh,

644
00:33:55.915 --> 00:33:58.605
says basically the Old Testament spots was Zach

645
00:33:58.605 --> 00:34:00.565
arrived in the four fields.

646
00:34:01.545 --> 00:34:03.965
So he himself indirectly is saying,

647
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:06.805
I don't count the intestinal stuff. Does that make sense

648
00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:08.345
Now? Yeah.

649
00:34:08.345 --> 00:34:09.645
Um, you're,

650
00:34:10.665 --> 00:34:12.325
the note you're looking for is on page five.

651
00:34:12.385 --> 00:34:17.245
Oh, read it. Um, it's talking about not Jesus.

652
00:34:18.365 --> 00:34:20.765
T it says, the New Testament refers

653
00:34:20.765 --> 00:34:23.645
to virtually every Old Testament book except to Ezra,

654
00:34:23.645 --> 00:34:26.485
Nehemiah, Esther, Ecclesiastes, and Psalm saw.

655
00:34:28.515 --> 00:34:29.515
Okay.

656
00:34:30.825 --> 00:34:33.205
Um, okay, so

657
00:34:33.755 --> 00:34:35.925
that is the Catholic apocryphal.

658
00:34:37.065 --> 00:34:41.445
Now the next question is, uh,

659
00:34:41.665 --> 00:34:44.125
the Bible itself mentions are quote 17 books,

660
00:34:44.125 --> 00:34:45.565
which we no longer have.

661
00:34:45.665 --> 00:34:49.285
And the fancy scholarly work for that is called a stand,

662
00:34:49.495 --> 00:34:51.085
means we don't have it around the anymore.

663
00:34:51.905 --> 00:34:56.565
Uh, and, uh, there are 17 books that the Bible mentions.

664
00:34:58.025 --> 00:35:00.725
And so one, if you were a, an atheist

665
00:35:00.725 --> 00:35:01.685
or something, you'd say, well,

666
00:35:01.685 --> 00:35:02.765
we don't even have all the Bible.

667
00:35:02.825 --> 00:35:04.925
The Bible itself tells us we don't have all the Bible.

668
00:35:06.225 --> 00:35:08.485
Is that true? Well, here's answer, I don't know.

669
00:35:09.745 --> 00:35:12.405
Uh, we have everything that we need in the Bible

670
00:35:12.435 --> 00:35:13.485
that we have now,

671
00:35:14.785 --> 00:35:18.685
but it's likely that the Bible was referring to these books

672
00:35:19.025 --> 00:35:20.045
for more references.

673
00:35:20.905 --> 00:35:22.765
So for example, uh, it'll say,

674
00:35:23.425 --> 00:35:25.325
and if you want to hear more about that battle,

675
00:35:25.785 --> 00:35:27.685
why don't you read about it more in the

676
00:35:27.685 --> 00:35:28.805
Battle of the Wars Bull.

677
00:35:31.105 --> 00:35:35.085
So, uh, we know that Paul, for example, uh,

678
00:35:35.185 --> 00:35:37.365
in the New Testament, referred to

679
00:35:39.075 --> 00:35:43.725
non-Christian Greek philosophers sometimes to say,

680
00:35:44.145 --> 00:35:45.325
as they would say,

681
00:35:45.985 --> 00:35:49.125
but that doesn't make them the Bible, right?
