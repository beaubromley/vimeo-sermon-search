1
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.190
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.830
I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.630
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.950
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.270
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.670
How am I supposed to follow that?

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.750
I was getting choked up, just standing there praying, listening to that.

8
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.750
Great. Are you Lord? Amen. That was sweet.

9
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.270
Thank you worship team. Well,

10
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.510
good morning everyone. My name is Ryan Whitaker,

11
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.870
and I love getting to serve as one of your elders. Thank you for that.

12
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.750
So I, I have to ask though, how has everybody summer been?

13
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.150
Been good, right? I see a lot of smiles out there and, hey,

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.510
don't worry students. I think we have infinite weeks left, right?

15
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.350
So don't worry about that for us. You know,

16
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.870
our summer has been pretty good. A few weeks ago,

17
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.190
Lindsay and I and our four kids, we, we all piled into our minivan. It's,

18
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.830
it's kind of like a clown car now, really. Uh,

19
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.670
but we piled into our car. We took a road trip to Michigan. Now,

20
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.870
if you're like me, uh,

21
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.030
Michigan really isn't the first place you think of to go on vacation to,

22
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.750
but we were fortunate to stay, uh, alongside a beach, a along Lake Superior.

23
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.600
And it was beautiful. It was, it was worth it. Now,

24
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.680
some of the beaches there in, uh,

25
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.480
in that area are blanketed by these round tumbled

26
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.320
rocks of every variety that you could possibly imagine.

27
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.920
Reds and greens and translucent and sparkly,

28
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.360
and those are just the ones that I know the geological terms for.

29
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.440
But what we learned from the locals is that for the good stuff,

30
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.680
if you're collecting for the good stuff, you have to dig deep.

31
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.940
The,

32
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.720
the really beautiful rocks are the ones that you have to dig

33
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.320
deep for and sift through. And so

34
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.470
pray that we're bringing up the rocks today in today's

35
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.110
psalm, that God wants us to see, the ones,

36
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.870
the rocks that glorify him the most. So while this,

37
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.350
this psalm today may strike you as familiar, the theme may be familiar to you.

38
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.110
I wanna challenge you to, to dig deep. Let's sit down and dig deep and,

39
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.990
and sift through God's word and pull up these beautiful rocks

40
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.710
together. So the,

41
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.770
the choice for you this morning is this.

42
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.250
You can hold onto these rocks as precious,

43
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.290
or you can find a,

44
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.820
a piece of driftwood in the approximate shape of a bat,

45
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.740
and absolutely

46
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.900
crush it right back into the lake.

47
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.100
At least that's what I saw my boys doing. So that's your choice.

48
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.483
This morning,

49
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.780
this Psalm touches on some pain that you might feel this morning,

50
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.940
some questions that you might have.

51
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.330
Is God angry with me?

52
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.080
Why is this suffering happening to me?

53
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.920
Is it because of something that I've done?

54
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.070
And will God rescue me? Well,

55
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.430
we believe that God's word is our anchoring truth.

56
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.790
So let's see what it says today. Before we dig in, let's pray.

57
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.910
Father, you are mighty to save.

58
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.830
Jesus, we need you. We can do nothing apart from you.

59
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.670
We can prepare and go and do in life,

60
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.950
but unless we do it with with you, it's empty

61
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.370
you and you alone bring the victory. Holy Spirit,

62
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.290
come in power. Help me to speak only what's in your holy word this morning.

63
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.610
And Christ's name we pray, amen. Amen. Now,

64
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.210
if you will turn in your bibles with me to Psalm 60. Psalm 60.

65
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.930
It's in the about in the middle of your Bible.

66
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.890
And while you're turning there, uh,

67
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.330
I'm so thankful for all the guys before me while John's on sabbatical.

68
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.890
We've had a lot of people filling in, all the guys filling in before me.

69
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.890
I'm so thankful for these faithful men. Brent, our boy,

70
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.010
Jimmy. He's always one of my favorites. Brandon, it was his birthday yesterday.

71
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.090
Make sure you tell him Happy birthday, but just wonderful,

72
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.490
wonderful gifts from the Lord in these men. I'm so thankful for them.

73
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.490
So, uh, I am in this lineup,

74
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.650
the pen ultimate as it were. Uh, next week we've saved the,

75
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.370
the best for last. We have Dr. Allen Rice and he's,

76
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.330
he'll be teaching us through Psalm 61.

77
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.570
And this will be before John returns the week after.

78
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.530
And we're so looking forward to that. So Psalm 60,

79
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.450
the heading for Psalm 60 says, says this,

80
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.430
he will tread down our foes to the choir master, according to sh sha Edith,

81
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.510
a mdo of David for instruction when he strove with Aram

82
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.430
Nahra and with Aram Zoba.

83
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.300
And when Joab on his return struck down 12,000 of Edam

84
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.780
in the Valley of Salt.

85
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.570
And so that's a, a long header.

86
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.170
It's a psalm that's meant to be sung to the tune of sh

87
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.140
Edith, which means Lilly of the testimony. Now,

88
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.300
we don't know what that tune sounds like,

89
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.700
but but since this is meant to be sung by a choir and it's during a time of

90
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.580
military pressure, it's likely to a driving marching beat.

91
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.620
Okay? So Psalm 60, it's written by David,

92
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.220
and he's serving as a, a voice for the people.

93
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.420
And it's a corporate lament.

94
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.020
God's people are crying out to him for help.

95
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.470
And this is a time when God's people were under military attack,

96
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.320
under military threat. And so,

97
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.240
so perhaps this is teaching us how to pray

98
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.320
during and through the fight.

99
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.920
Now, the,

100
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.720
the battle mentioned in this title is likely what we see in Second

101
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.360
Samuel eight, where David emerges Victoria.

102
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.200
So we know the outcome of this.

103
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.120
David's efforts come in as victorious,

104
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.440
where they defeat 18,000 Edomites in the valley of salt.

105
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.760
Now, that tally is a little bit different than what we see in this psalm,

106
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.760
but we can easily account for that by taking into account different generals

107
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.840
at play, Joe ab versus abs shy,

108
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.040
and also the timing of the tally.

109
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.780
So it's not an issue at this time.

110
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.900
David was probably ruling over, uh, only part of Israel.

111
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.020
Not yet all of it. And what's interesting about this psalm,

112
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.980
I think you'll find this interesting, is that this is like a behind the scenes

113
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.220
really, because it,

114
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.340
it exposes the defeats and the setbacks that David

115
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.300
and his people experienced when the military campaign wasn't yet complete.

116
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.980
And so in this way, Psalm 60 is like a peek into David's diary.

117
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.900
And second Samuel eight is almost like his Instagram,

118
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.190
his highlight reel as an example in Second Samuel eight.

119
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.030
You'll see this two different times.

120
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.750
But it says the Lord gave victory to David wherever he went.

121
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.990
The Lord gave victory to David wherever he went. And yes,

122
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.270
we know that to be true in an overall sense, overall victory.

123
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.870
But Psalm 60 gives us an inside view into the

124
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.430
turmoil and the defeat that forms the patchwork for it.

125
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.430
The Psalm is divided up into three distinct sections.

126
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:04.350
And I think it'd be more accurate to call it tectonic plate shifts.

127
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.073
Why?

128
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.880
Because we watch David as he goes from subdued

129
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.640
into deep dark defeat and depression,

130
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.800
perhaps to uplifted,

131
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:26.000
to mountaintop heights in verifiable victory.

132
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.240
And you only go from low defeat to high victory

133
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.920
when God is working in you in plate tectonic

134
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.550
shifting ways. So let's see that.

135
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.393
Let's dig in.

136
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.910
The first shift that we see is that David is rejected.

137
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.510
He is rejected.

138
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.190
Let's read verses one through four. Now, oh God,

139
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.110
you have rejected us, broken our defenses. You have been angry. Oh,

140
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.710
restore us. You have made the land to quake. You have torn it open repair,

141
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.950
its breaches for it. Toters,

142
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.670
you have made your people see hard things.

143
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:18.510
You have given us wine to drink that makes us stagger.

144
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.650
You have set up a banner for those who fear you,

145
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.810
that they may flee to it from the bow sayah.

146
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.890
Now these verses one through four, they immediately reminded me of, uh,

147
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.410
the song Trouble by Ray Lamont,

148
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.650
who here knows that song? I'm sure a lot of you do. Uh,

149
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.930
and I would sing it for you.

150
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:48.490
But my fear is that my rendition would be a little bit too accurate and

151
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.170
uh, it may cause YouTube to take this sermon video down. Okay?

152
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.290
So just the lyrics this morning, it goes a little bit something like this.

153
00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.730
Again, this is trouble by Ray Laane. Trouble,

154
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.500
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble,

155
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.980
trouble been dogging me since the day I was born.

156
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.580
Worry, worry, worry, worry,

157
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.980
worry, worry.

158
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.340
Just won't seem to leave my mind alone.

159
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.900
So we have trouble and we have worry.

160
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.420
And this is, uh, exactly what we're seeing here in verses one through four.

161
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.140
And, and really it's, uh,

162
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.220
all of David's life is what what that is too. It's all trouble.

163
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.560
Early in his life, he was overlooked for King.

164
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.320
He contended with the threat of Goliath,

165
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:55.260
endless pursuit by Saul's murder squad. Thank you Brent for that word.

166
00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.220
Exiled from his home for years, his wife McCall taken from him.

167
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.620
He lost Samuel, he lost his best friend Jonathan.

168
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.580
Even the loss of Saul was sorrowful for him.

169
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.020
His daughter was violated. His two sons,

170
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.660
Absalom, Ajah both rebelled against him. Both killed.

171
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.460
And then there's the whole episode with Bathsheba and Uriah and

172
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.120
on and on and on. It's good to be king,

173
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.480
right? When you're king,

174
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.040
you have king-sized problems

175
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.320
and the weight of a crown is measured in worries, not gold.

176
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.640
At least maybe that's how we're tempted to think here.

177
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.760
You know, when you, when you really examine the core of each of his troubles,

178
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.940
they're actually not that different than ours.

179
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.560
So see that this morning maybe you've had your string of troubles too.

180
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.920
You've been overlooked and o underestimated at work.

181
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.920
You've been passed over for a promotion.

182
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.320
Your boss is impossible or you're not given credit for something,

183
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.120
or you're even dealing with job loss right now,

184
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.250
or even hit with serious illness, financial hardship,

185
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.050
or even a family crisis.

186
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.850
Or you've sinned in some way and you're dealing with the consequences of that.

187
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.170
You've lost relationships, you've lost trust,

188
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.640
and you're dealing with personal guilt, immense personal guilt right now.

189
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.630
Or your marriage is struggling

190
00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.590
or you feel alone.

191
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:56.310
And any of these troubles can make it feel as if

192
00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:01.100
God is rejecting you. Well,

193
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.740
David is feeling that two.

194
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.450
So in verse one,

195
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.410
David starts with just that by stating how God has rejected him and his

196
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.330
people. Oh God, you have rejected us.

197
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.870
Have you noticed that? That when someone rejects us,

198
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.310
sometimes it can feel like physical pain.

199
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:30.420
Science seems to show that the part of our brain that processes

200
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.460
rejection is the same part of our brain that processes physical pain.

201
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.100
That's right.

202
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.820
They're saying that that rejection is like physical pain to

203
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.530
our brain. Now, I, I don't know if that's true,

204
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:50.100
maybe it is, but man alive, I do know that rejection hurts.

205
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.840
It feels like I've been rejected in,

206
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.240
in every sphere of life more than more times than I can count.

207
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.990
And I think that you've probably felt that rejection too.

208
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.020
So when David says God has rejected, rejected us, that hurts, David hurts.

209
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.860
And some commentaries here describe the scene of rejection as one that is

210
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.300
steeped in contempt,

211
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:22.190
that God is sick of him and that he is

212
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.110
so disgusted with him. He,

213
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.670
he's trying to fling him away as he would and insect, he's like, ah,

214
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.750
get away from me.

215
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.630
But I think what we're seeing here is David's exposed temptation to

216
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.670
feel as if God is rejecting him,

217
00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.990
to feel like God is condemning him.

218
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:49.170
Continuing on in the text still in verse one, God, you've broken our defenses.

219
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:53.130
You've been angry with us. Restore us. He's crying out for reversal.

220
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.650
Here you have made the land quake, you have torn it open repair.

221
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.690
Its breaches for it. Totters.

222
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.730
This is like a building that's just about to fall over.

223
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.160
You have made your people see hard things.

224
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.340
You have given us wine to drink that makes us stagger. Now in scripture,

225
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.140
sometimes wine is a blessing

226
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.620
And sometimes it is judgment. Here it is judgment.

227
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.530
The wine here is judgment. It makes it to where we can't move.

228
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.290
It's bringing confusion and it's making us weak.

229
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.190
Have you ever said this before? Like I have,

230
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.870
this is so confusing why this is happening to me.

231
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.610
So now let's pull off on a scenic overlook. Let's,

232
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:54.210
let's put the car in park and uh, let's turn on the map lights and,

233
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.970
and figure out where we are. Let's ask some questions.

234
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.360
Do you wanna ask some hard questions this morning? Let's do it.

235
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:08.130
Why is David saying that God has rejected him, that God is angry with them,

236
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.490
that God has broken their defenses and on and on and on.

237
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.890
He's saying that God has done all these things. Why is he saying this?

238
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.000
Maybe the inverse question is this.

239
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:24.200
Why is he not saying that their enemies have done this,

240
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.440
that the enemy has broken their defenses, or that the,

241
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.840
the enemy has torn the land apart? Well,

242
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.320
it's because David is looking to the ultimate source here.

243
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.400
David says God has broken their defenses.

244
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:44.450
Yes, Edam, Felicia, Moab have all crushed David and defeat,

245
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.810
but they were acting as instruments of God's will

246
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.940
Agents or instruments of God's will.

247
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.160
So when David says, you have made us see hard things,

248
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.080
we rightly know that God has indeed made us see

249
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.063
hard things.

250
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.180
And we see this with Job when Satan takes everything away from

251
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.940
job, job says what He says,

252
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.980
the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.

253
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.520
And what does this cause David to likely do?

254
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.480
Well if we know David from scripture,

255
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.690
we know that he is probably examining his heart

256
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.930
in the midst of trial. The trouble that's on him

257
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.650
is causing him to rightly measure himself and his people against

258
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.450
God's holiness.

259
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.570
In Psalm 1 39, 23 through 24,

260
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.090
David cries out to God and he says, search me. Oh God,

261
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.810
know my heart.

262
00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:03.390
Try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any

263
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.710
grievous way in me

264
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.520
and lead me in the way everlasting.

265
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.520
That is spiritual self-examination.

266
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:24.040
And we'll see that this spiritual self-examination produces fruit.

267
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.080
And boy is that fruit. Sweet.

268
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.820
Let's talk a moment for on discipline and suffering.

269
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.820
Before we ask any questions. First we need to understand this believer,

270
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.290
God does not hate you. It does hate your sin.

271
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:48.690
And there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ

272
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.650
Jesus. Amen. Amen.

273
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:59.110
So how are you to understand the rejection of God's plans in your life or the

274
00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.470
suffering that you're under? Is this discipline from the Lord?

275
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.270
Well, Hebrews 12,

276
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:10.270
six says the Lord disciplines the one he loves and chastises

277
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.430
every son he receives.

278
00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:17.270
So God can see a pattern of sin in your life

279
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:22.270
and he may directly intervene to snap us out of it

280
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:28.790
and to refine us and to bring us into repentance. But understand this,

281
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.430
it's all out of his deep love for us.

282
00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.230
So he can discipline.

283
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.610
But on the other hand, we look at passages like Matthew nine,

284
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.450
when Jesus is asked a question about why this certain man was born blind.

285
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.180
Well was it, was it because his, uh,

286
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.020
he sinned or was it because his parents sinned?

287
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.460
And Jesus answers?

288
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:58.420
It's not because he sinned or because his parents sinned,

289
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.420
but so that the works of God might be displayed in

290
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.513
him.

291
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.380
So God may or may not make it clear to you if

292
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.420
something you're going through is discipline.

293
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.100
But what we do know is that every trial, you're you,

294
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.100
you face is designed to sanctify you,

295
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.540
to make you holy and bring him glory.

296
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.220
In other words, he wants to kill your sin.

297
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.740
He wants to increase your joy in Christ.

298
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.860
He wants to increase your love for him and for other people.

299
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.780
And it's all under his banner of glory.

300
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.540
James one says this, count it all joy my brothers.

301
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.180
When you meet trials of various kinds for you know that the testing

302
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.620
of your faith produces what

303
00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:00.810
steadfastness and let's steadfastness have its full

304
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:05.490
effect, that you may be perfect and complete,

305
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.970
lacking in nothing.

306
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.140
Back to the verse, back to the text. Verse four.

307
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.020
Here you have set up a banner for those who fear you,

308
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:20.220
that they may flee to it from the bow Sayah. When we read Sayah,

309
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.700
it's a good moment always to take a breath to pause.

310
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.340
And it says here that God has set up a banner for them.

311
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.860
The Hebrew word for banner is ness. What is a banner?

312
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:35.740
Well, a banner in scripture is typically a beautifully ornamented

313
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.300
flag or banner, and it's held up high on a po on a pole.

314
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.620
And it's held up front by someone brave,

315
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.620
perhaps the commander.

316
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.480
And a banner declares who you belong to and who you fight

317
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:54.403
under

318
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.840
a banner declares who you belong to and who you fight under.

319
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.710
Yet the context here, you have to see this is unusual.

320
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.190
The banner here isn't rallying the troops for an offensive,

321
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.550
but instead we find ourselves in a sea of trouble,

322
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.710
rejected shattered defenses, anger lo the the land torn apart.

323
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.930
Trouble, trouble, trouble,

324
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.793
trouble.

325
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.110
And this is signaling continued trouble,

326
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.850
not refuge or any sign of victory.

327
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:43.130
But maybe you could see it as maybe serving a defensive role as a place to

328
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:46.460
retreat and to hide. But maybe,

329
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.420
and I would say probably

330
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:56.280
this fleeing to the banner is disastrous as it paints a target

331
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.280
around God's people.

332
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.280
For the enemy archers to absolutely unleash their arrows.

333
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.320
That is devastating. Devastating.

334
00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.990
So it's clear that God's people have experienced serious setbacks, serious pain,

335
00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:19.190
and they have been rejected. Rejected. Okay,

336
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:24.150
so now let's move on to verses five through eight where we see our second shift.

337
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.790
This is a shift where David is reminded,

338
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:32.320
he's reminded of God's promises. Okay?

339
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:32.560
Again,

340
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:37.160
this is verses five through eight that your beloved ones may be delivered.

341
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.920
Give salvation by your right hand and answer us.

342
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.400
God has spoken in his holiness with exultation,

343
00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:49.240
with rejoicing. I will divide up she him and portion out the veil of sko.

344
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:54.600
Gilead is mine. Manasas mind. Rai is my helmet. Judah is my scepter.

345
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.760
Moab is my wash basin. Upon Eden, I cast my shoe over Felicia,

346
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.880
a shout in triumph.

347
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.120
Verse five, that your beloved ones may be delivered here.

348
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:13.000
David makes the plea for deliverance or salvation for the beloved

349
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.280
ones. Now, in this plea,

350
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.280
you can feel his desperation and he's appealing to the intimate

351
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.640
covenant relationship between him and God's people here.

352
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.820
And David makes it personal by using the word beloved.

353
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.860
The that his name David means beloved,

354
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.420
we are your beloved. So save us.

355
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.623
Right?

356
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.060
And he asked God to give salvation by your right hand.

357
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.780
The right hand always symbolizes power. Save us by your power.

358
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.500
In desperation, he pleads to God, answer us.

359
00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:04.440
And look here immediately after he says,

360
00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:09.840
answer us. It's as if God is stepping in and says, here I am,

361
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.280
I'm speaking to you.

362
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:18.590
To be reminded of his promises is to revive your soul

363
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:23.270
and for your eyes to be enlightened. Psalm 19 says,

364
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.750
it's beautiful. 11 years ago,

365
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.060
I found myself in the middle of a challenging work situation.

366
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.980
I felt alone and overwhelmed. And it was,

367
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.740
it was hard to keep all the holes in the boat plugged

368
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.340
and this feeling of overwhelm flowed into all of life.

369
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.020
At this time, our four kids were still little bitty kiddos.

370
00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.220
We were in the trenches

371
00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.860
and it seemed like the Lord was leading me in a new direction. Now this,

372
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.020
this time wasn't a time of moral failing.

373
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.220
This was more of an more an issue of calling.

374
00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.600
But what began was rug pull.

375
00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:15.240
After rug pull and days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months.

376
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.760
Expectations were set only to be dashed and delayed.

377
00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.240
And disapp disappointment after disappointment. It was a vicious,

378
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:28.310
vicious rollercoaster. God, have you rejected me?

379
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.710
Why have you not gone out into battle with me?

380
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:36.270
Is this discipline that you're bringing on me? God,

381
00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.550
will you rescue me from this?

382
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.010
Can I be honest with you here?

383
00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.910
It was in this season that I came to know what depression was.

384
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.640
Every morning I'd wake up and I would feel glued to my bed.

385
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.240
I didn't want to get outta bed.

386
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.560
But then I did get ready and I'd climb into the car

387
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.470
and boy, I'd gripped that steering wheel so tightly.

388
00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.920
And as I'm driving into work, I'm looking through the windshield.

389
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.680
It didn't mi it didn't matter if it was hin, brilliance outside

390
00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.960
every day was overcast.

391
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.130
But in that, in that struggle,

392
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:38.050
do you know what broke through the clouds for me being

393
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.570
reminded of God's promises, being reminded of God's promises,

394
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:48.210
I was reminded of his promises by meditating on his

395
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.040
word. Many passages were special to me,

396
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.720
but one in particular became so special to me.

397
00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.990
Over the course of that year,

398
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.310
I can't tell you how many times I recited and prayed and even sang

399
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.990
this verse, Psalm 86, 5 through seven,

400
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.210
for, for you oh Lord, are good and forgiving,

401
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.850
abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you, give ear,

402
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:25.050
oh Lord, to my prayer, listen to my plea for grace.

403
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.810
In the day of my trouble, I call on you.

404
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.610
For you answer me, He answers us.

405
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.690
And where did those verses come from?

406
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.900
They came from scripture memory,

407
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.360
man alive. I praise God for my friend Merle,

408
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:52.440
and for the near decade that I spent with him memorizing hours and hours

409
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.600
and hours of scripture praying for each other, holding each other accountable.

410
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.480
But listen to this, every time my heart and my mind were,

411
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.440
were tempted to believe lies from the devil about God,

412
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.880
lies about me, lies about my family.

413
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:16.520
God's word stood on the ready to immediately remind me

414
00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.080
that he is good.

415
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.700
Even when it,

416
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.370
it sure seems like this isn't good to remind me that

417
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:31.410
he loves me even when it seems like how in the world can this

418
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:36.210
be love to remind me that he will rescue me

419
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.490
even when this pain feels never ending.

420
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.400
Now the standard asterisks apply here. Of course,

421
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.440
if you're struggling with depression, please get help.

422
00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.640
See a counselor go to m oj across the parking lot, doctor,

423
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.080
come talk with one of us. We can help point you the right direction.

424
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.400
Whatever God leads you toward,

425
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.360
make sure that God's word is at the forefront of it.

426
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:08.360
God's word needs to lead. His word needs to lead.

427
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:14.720
Also, scripture memory isn't a replacement for regular Bible intake,

428
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:19.570
but give it a shot. Try it fighter verses.com Okay?

429
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.940
At the end, uh, all of this,

430
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:27.980
this sounds like a disclaimer for a pharmaceutical drug. Uh, uh,

431
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.700
scripture memory can cause discoloration of your Bible. Um,

432
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.180
but God's word revived my soul. It enlightened my eyes.

433
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.750
It broke through the clouds. Now the, the clouds, they kept coming,

434
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:49.550
but they kept breaking and eventually for good praise God.

435
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.260
Back to the text. Verse five, God has spoken in his holiness Again.

436
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:59.660
This is God showing up with his word after David cries for help.

437
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.140
Now look at these lands that God speaks about here, check him,

438
00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.860
which is to the west of the Jordan, the valley of sakat to the east,

439
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.060
and so on and so on and so on.

440
00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:12.260
Every one of these places is a part of the land that is, uh,

441
00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.220
part of what God promised to Israel.

442
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.900
And if you were to connect each of these like dots on a map,

443
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:24.900
it forms everything that is under Israel's, under God's control.

444
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.580
This is Israel. It's kind of like if we were to say something like,

445
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.860
New York City is mine and Miami is mine, and San Diego is mine,

446
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.180
and Seattle is mine. And that would,

447
00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.420
you'd come to understand that that is everything within the United States the

448
00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.220
same kind of thing here. So as God speaks here,

449
00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:46.900
he describes things as done, which haven't even happened yet.

450
00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.620
And so we see in is in, uh, Isaiah 46 11. God says,

451
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.580
I have spoken and I will bring it to pass.

452
00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.420
I have purposed and I will do it.

453
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.810
This is like a divine version of our phrase. Consider it done.

454
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.470
It's done guaranteed.

455
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:15.610
Except have you ever noticed how how confident some people are when they say

456
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:21.040
that phrase, consider it done wives, you ask your husband,

457
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.520
Hey, would you mind picking up some milk on your way home? And then you're,

458
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.880
you're hit with, oh, oh yeah, consider it done.

459
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.910
It's like he's giving you a five star guarantee that uh,

460
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.430
that it's happening right then and there. You might be tempted to think, boy,

461
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.310
he must be on his way to Brahms right now.

462
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:46.230
But then you get home and where's the milk? It's, it's nowhere.

463
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:51.150
It's nowhere. Consider it done. It's more like,

464
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.510
well, I contemplated it and uh,

465
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.030
if I remember to do it and if,

466
00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:00.630
if I don't need to pick up some spackle from Lowe's, right,

467
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:02.583
consider it done.

468
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:08.350
How do we as people have the audacity to claim something is done that

469
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.970
isn't done? No,

470
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.410
only when God says something like, consider it done,

471
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:20.790
can we actually consider it done? It's not a maybe.

472
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:27.070
No. When God says it, the milk's already in the fridge. Okay,

473
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.173
back to the text.

474
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.790
These lands are divided up to each of the tribes of Israel. And when God says,

475
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:38.630
Gilead is mine, Judah's my scepter and so on,

476
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.350
he's affirming his sovereignty over every inch of Israel.

477
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.470
F aim, the protective helmet represents the northern tribes.

478
00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:48.750
And Judah,

479
00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:54.110
the royal scepter signifies the monarchy Jerusalem there in the south.

480
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:58.830
But guess what? God's sovereignty doesn't stop there. He says,

481
00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.430
Moab is my wash basin. Eat him. I cast my shoe. Felicia,

482
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.590
I shout in triumph. Moab is east of Israel.

483
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.550
It's outside of Israel in a low spot near the Dead Sea.

484
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:14.470
And God is making it a place where he's washing his feet

485
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:20.290
and he's kicking off his shoes toward Edam also in the east.

486
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.010
Like he's like, they're a servant to him.

487
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.010
And he's shouting over Felicia in triumph, in victory.

488
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:31.690
So here when we see that God is in control of nations that have long been

489
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:33.690
thorns in Israel's side,

490
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.620
and these nations were once arrogant enemies,

491
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.660
but now they're serving in the lowliest of ways to the victorious

492
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.180
God of Israel. God opposes the proud,

493
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.460
but gives grace to humble. At this point we've seen David's plans rejected.

494
00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:57.420
We've seen him be reminded of God's promises and now we'll see

495
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.100
David restored.

496
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.940
Let's read that now verses nine through 12.

497
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.340
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Eden?

498
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:13.580
Have you not rejected us? Oh God, you do not. Go forth. Oh God,

499
00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.420
with our armies who grant us help against the fae. For Sal,

500
00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:21.300
vain is the salvation of man with God.

501
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.540
We shall do valiantly.

502
00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.140
It is he who will tread down our FAEs.

503
00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.980
Now this fortified city that we see in verse nine,

504
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.980
it's probably Petra, which means rock.

505
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.700
And this was a stronghold of edem.

506
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.380
And the only way into Petra is through the narrow and steep

507
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.980
canyon called the Sikh s I Q.

508
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.980
And there's only room there for two horses side by side to make it in.

509
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:57.420
And in this canyon, you were literally between a rock and a hard place.

510
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.470
Petra was a hard place to get into,

511
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.270
which also then means that it was a easy place to defend

512
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:08.210
The Tite.

513
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:13.810
Archers and troops would literally line the canyon walls and rain

514
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.930
down arrows and rocks on anybody who was to attack.

515
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:24.690
So suffice it to say Petra was safe for centuries.

516
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:30.100
So this is why we see David crying out

517
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.380
to God for help in this area. He says,

518
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.020
who will bring me to Petra? Who will bring me to this fortified city? Verse 10,

519
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:43.620
David reminds God of his problem. He needs help. Have you rejected us?

520
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.620
You're not going out with our armies. Verse 11,

521
00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:52.020
David cries out in desperation. Grant us help against the fae.

522
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.940
Israel has no hope apart from God.

523
00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.760
Starting now in the second half of verse 11 through the rest of the psalm,

524
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.600
this is where we strike gold.

525
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:09.040
This is the fruit of self-examination,

526
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.520
which is brought on by adversity.

527
00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:18.120
The next three lines are the message that I believe that God has for us today

528
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:20.840
from Psalm 60. First,

529
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:24.840
David declares vain is the salvation of man.

530
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.320
Vain is the salvation of man.

531
00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:33.160
And I think that this reveals the sin that David has uncovered

532
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.300
in the face of suffering. He has examined his heart.

533
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.980
And what is he uncovered? Pride.

534
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.170
His prideful. Striving is vain.

535
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.353
It's empty.

536
00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:56.470
He tried to win the battle himself and he is losing.

537
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.820
Next verse 12, with God, we shall do valiantly,

538
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:08.690
valiant as in with courage and with determination.

539
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.460
Notice that this isn't saying Let's sit back in our recliner and let's

540
00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.980
watch God do valiantly. No,

541
00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.300
it's with God. We will do valiantly.

542
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:30.850
Our hand is on the plow and God's hand is on our

543
00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.970
hand. Maybe you've heard this said this way.

544
00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:40.050
God works in what? What we work out. God works in what we work out.

545
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.250
In Philippians two,

546
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:46.650
Paul writes to the church to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.

547
00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:51.490
For it is God who works in you to will and to work for his

548
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.160
good pleasure. So we work it out.

549
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.720
God works in us to make it all happen.

550
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:03.270
Second half of verse 12 says this, it is God,

551
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:07.110
he who will bring down our foes. Make no mistake,

552
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.470
God is the 100% victor in the fight.

553
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.670
Proverbs 2131 says,

554
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.110
the horse is made ready for the day of battle,

555
00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:20.390
but victory belongs to the Lord.

556
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.950
Victory belongs to the Lord.

557
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:29.070
This is no contradiction to the line before that says

558
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.960
this With God,

559
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.040
we will do valiantly

560
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:42.320
because he does it all and we give it our all. He does it all.

561
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.440
We give it our all. So in fact,

562
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:51.000
any efforts on our own try to do it without him is sin. Let's be clear on that.

563
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.320
And in this arrangement, the triumph isn't ours to claim,

564
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.400
but it's God's to give.

565
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:05.140
The Psalm is clear on this point. Without God we have no hope.

566
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:09.420
There is no backup plan, there's no plan B.

567
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:14.730
And this psalm in much of the Old Testament concerns itself with physical

568
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.850
battles and conquest. You see that,

569
00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.920
but you and I know today that we are engaged in

570
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.680
spiritual battles. Ephesians six is very clear on this.

571
00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.520
We don't fight against flesh and blood,

572
00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:35.460
but we have a spiritual battlefield that lays in front of us

573
00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.280
day in and day out.

574
00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.440
And we are hopeless in these battles unless we have his presence, his wisdom,

575
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.620
his hand on our hand. And when we do,

576
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.220
we will do valiantly.

577
00:41:56.020 --> 00:42:00.520
So in these shifts from rejected to reminded to restored,

578
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:05.680
it's clear, the same God that staggers us, steadies us.

579
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:10.720
Where the song trouble falls apart

580
00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:16.440
Is that Ray LaMonte declares that in the troubles that he's in,

581
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:19.200
he's been saved by a woman.

582
00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.730
Makes for a popular song, but a woman can't save you.

583
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.450
And women, a man can't save you.

584
00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:36.350
So if you're here today with trouble surrounding you, you're feeling broken,

585
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:38.790
defeated, or lost, I want to encourage you.

586
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:42.430
I want you to know that you're in the right place.

587
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.770
This is a safe place to be real, to be vulnerable with God and with each other.

588
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.640
And we're not here to pretend like we have it all together.

589
00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.760
By God's grace we'll be a people humble and lowly.

590
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.560
We're here to embrace our brokenness and to invite God's restoration into

591
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:09.640
our lives. You know, as we've studied all of Psalm 60 today,

592
00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:15.370
maybe you're still thinking, uh, this battle that I'm in,

593
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:19.890
this doesn't feel like love. Guess what? When you read scripture,

594
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:24.850
you always read scripture in light of the rest of scripture.

595
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.080
So maybe this will help you.

596
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.620
Maybe Zephaniah a three will help you fill in some blanks.

597
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:35.260
Zephaniah is a prophet describing the coming day of the Lord,

598
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:38.740
which is a day of salvation through judgment.

599
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:45.300
This is f and i three 11 through 12. This is God speaking. Oh, on that day,

600
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.460
you shall not be put to shame because of the deeds by which you have rebelled

601
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.293
against me.

602
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.460
For then I will remove from your midst your proudly exalted ones,

603
00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.620
and you shall no longer be haughty or arrogant in my holy

604
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.180
mountain. But I will leave in your midst of people humble and lowly.

605
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.380
So just as David and his pride try to muscle it and manufacture it,

606
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.340
and his plans were crushed.

607
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.100
So the Lord removes the proudly exalted ones like Edem,

608
00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:20.700
leaving behind a people,

609
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:26.460
a remnant humble and lowly people who

610
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.820
desperately depend on the Lord.

611
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.280
So now listen to the joy, the restoration,

612
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.360
and the love that the Lord brings to his people. In verse 11,

613
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:40.600
this is glorious. The Lord your God is in your midst,

614
00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.280
a mighty one who will save.

615
00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.400
He will rejoice over you with gladness,

616
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.560
he will quiet you by his love.

617
00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:54.440
He will exalt or rejoice over you with loud singing

618
00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.720
believer He will deliver you.

619
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.660
He is the mighty one who will save. Consider it done.

620
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.580
God loves you, rejoices over you with loud singing,

621
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.620
and I hope that you feel that in your bones.

622
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:16.960
In Exodus 11,

623
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.640
Moses builds an altar to remember a victory that the Lord very clearly gave him.

624
00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:23.560
And after that he,

625
00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.800
he builds an altar to remember this victory that God gave.

626
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.120
And he calls this alter Jehovah NCI

627
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.433
Jehovah N,

628
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:39.440
which means the Lord is my banner,

629
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.480
the Lord is my banner.

630
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.093
The

631
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:49.880
This is very different than the banner that we saw today in verse four.

632
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:52.240
When we strive without God,

633
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.440
we are under a banner that serves as a target for the enemy.

634
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:03.160
Yet when we battle with the Lord well with God,

635
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.240
we will do valiantly.

636
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:11.950
And this banner that we fight under becomes the one that unites us and

637
00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.710
assures us the victory.

638
00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.830
What banner would you rather fight under

639
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.233
a target

640
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:22.770
Or

641
00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:25.800
Under the sure sign of victory?

642
00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:30.030
The truth is this.

643
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:34.670
There are people here today who aren't fighting under God's

644
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:38.230
banner. Maybe that's you.

645
00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:41.190
You're fighting and you're striving and you're trying.

646
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:46.070
And I think that you're finding that it's coming up short for you.

647
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:50.870
But listen, there's hope. There's hope.

648
00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:56.590
It's only through the gospel that we see Jesus Christ become our true

649
00:46:56.650 --> 00:47:01.170
banner with him. Our victory is guaranteed

650
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:06.650
by burying our sins on the cross, rising from the dead.

651
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:09.770
He defeated sin and death. You see,

652
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:13.410
he drank the cup of judgment that we deserved.

653
00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:19.530
He drank the wine that that was meant for us to cause us to

654
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:23.760
stagger. When we turn away from our sins,

655
00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:27.680
trust in Jesus as our Lord and Savior were forever

656
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.540
identified under his victorious banner

657
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:37.010
and we fight with him valiantly. So today,

658
00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:41.330
if you're not fighting under Christ's banner, come talk to us.

659
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:46.520
One of us down front after the service, we'd love to talk with you. Church,

660
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:49.480
Jesus is our banner.
