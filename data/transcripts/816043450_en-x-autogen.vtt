00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.300
if you

2
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.400
he is risen.

3
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Okay, he is risen.

4
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.000
amen, amen

5
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.500
They always talk about how Easter Sunday

6
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.100
is fairly simple to preach because

7
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.400
there's already a lot of anticipation and a lot of things going

8
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.200
in life. It's one of my favorite Sundays of

9
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.600
the year. It really does feel like there is newness. There's

10
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.200
life there's excitement. And so I pray that that's true

11
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.400
for you today that there may be some Resurrection happening in your own

12
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.200
heart as you are here, but the

13
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.300
last couple weeks we have been talking about

14
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.500
how this this gospel message

15
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.300
these first four books of the New Testament. We

16
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.200
call the gospels how that points us to believing

17
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.900
in Jesus as the Son of God and

18
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.200
talking specifically in that defense that

19
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.400
you may believe and we've said that each gospel writer Matthew

20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.200
Mark Luke and John they were they were inspired by

21
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.500
God's spirit to record not just by a graphical information

22
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500
about Jesus but to talk about how the

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.600
gospel message his life death and Resurrection

24
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.800
is the Hope for sinners like

25
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.500
and me

26
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400
it's not just a hey there's Sue. Jesus was like here's what he

27
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.300
did for us as well. That's what the

28
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.400
whole gospels are about and that's the really the thread

29
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.100
that runs through all four of the gospels that

30
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
is diverse. As you read them to be

31
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.700
they all have the same basic skeleton of events that point

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.200
us to this good news.

33
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.100
If you remember over the last couple weeks if you've been here that truth

34
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.400
is that Jesus has existed from eternity

35
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.800
past.

36
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.400
Yet he took on flesh was born of a virgin.

37
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.600
He lived a perfect life revealing the

38
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.200
father through his his truth speaking

39
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.800
and through his power revealing his

40
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.200
his miraculous work that he was doing

41
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.500
he showed who God was to us yet, even

42
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.400
though he never sinned in that whole process of

43
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.100
his life. He was brutally nailed to

44
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.200
a tree for

45
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.400
our sin

46
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400
what we deserved

47
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.400
that he became a sacrifice in our place to

48
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.400
pay the price for our sin and open the way back

49
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.600
up to God.

50
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.200
Yet as we've already said today his death was not

51
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.700
the end.

52
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.500
There was hope coming that that after a couple days he

53
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.800
walked out of that tomb alive where he

54
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.200
then defeated sin and death forever in that

55
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.700
action.

56
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.300
See that is the cohesive thread that

57
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.300
runs through all four of the gospels. They all have a

58
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.000
different perspective on those events. But but

59
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.300
that's what holds it all together really holds

60
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.400
the whole Bible together when you look at it in its essence.

61
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.600
But Matthew wrote that to the

62
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.200
Jews Luke wrote that to the Gentiles and

63
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
we'll see today.

64
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.400
How John has perspective on

65
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.500
those events and and his unique Viewpoint as

66
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500
he walks through that with Jesus?

67
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.400
So if you're not already there, let's take our copies of

68
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.400
God's word together and turn with me to The Gospel

69
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.700
according to John.

70
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.600
If you don't have one there might be a hardback one around

71
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.200
you underneath one of the seats. If you don't have a Bible take that

72
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.300
with you, that's our gift to you. We'd love for you to take that and read

73
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.400
about who Jesus is.

74
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.800
But we're gonna be in The Gospel according to John chapter 20 nearly

75
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800
towards the end of John.

76
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.400
And the end of chapter 20 as well.

77
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.400
John chapter 20 starting verse 30 is where we're going to be now.

78
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.700
Here's one tip about how to read the Bible.

79
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.600
Like when you're reading through the Bible if you're unfamiliar with

80
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.300
how to do that one tip is just to look for a purpose statement

81
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.300
in each book.

82
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.600
Why did that person write what they wrote and

83
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.200
so thankfully in the Book of John The Gospel according to

84
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.600
John we have his he gave us his purpose statement

85
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.600
here. It is John chapter 20 verse 30 and

86
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.300
31.

87
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.100
Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the

88
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.500
disciples which are not written in this book.

89
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.200
But these the things that I write down

90
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.900
are written.

91
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.500
So that you may believe that Jesus

92
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.500
is the Christ the son of God.

93
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.400
And that by believing you may have

94
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.500
life in his name.

95
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.300
So again out of the millions of things that

96
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.500
John could have included here about Jesus. Did you

97
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.400
see why the Holy Spirit inspired John to

98
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.800
write the things that he did.

99
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.100
So that you would believe.

100
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400
So that I would believe.

101
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.100
That Jesus is the Christ the son of

102
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.600
God the savior.

103
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.600
And that that belief he says would lead to

104
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.300
life in his name.

105
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.000
That's why we do this every week.

106
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.800
That's why we gather like this. That's why we talk about Jesus the

107
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.300
way we do that's why we've defended why we

108
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.900
can trust what we have in the Bible. It's so that we

109
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.100
can challenge you challenge each other

110
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.100
with the truth of this good news. That's the power

111
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.800
of God for the Salvation of those who believe.

112
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.200
It's merely to put Jesus in front of us and what he's

113
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.100
done so that we would believe.

114
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.400
That's why some of you are here today.

115
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.500
We pray.

116
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.300
But listen, even if you hear all that and you're like, okay, I

117
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.300
already believe all this already. Okay, even if you believe

118
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.300
all this already, aren't you looking for life?

119
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.500
Like that's what John says right so they may have life in

120
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.000
his name. Aren't you looking for life and couragement? That's what

121
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.300
we live our lives for. We're always looking for better.

122
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.100
John says it's found here.

123
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.700
In what I've written and so so as

124
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.700
you hear all this don't check out don't think this is just evangelism don't

125
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.100
think this is not for you. This is for you as

126
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.600
well to find life.

127
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.800
In what John's written here?

128
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.600
So here's the first unique element that John included is

129
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.500
he looked at jesus' life and gospel from

130
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.400
his perspective.

131
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.300
Here's the first unique thing that John included here in verses

132
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.200
19 through 29 of chapter 20, just right

133
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.100
above where we read a second ago.

134
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.600
Now the context here, let me set the scene was this

135
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.600
was after Jesus had come back to life. He died

136
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.500
on the cross been buried resurrected from the grave

137
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.100
were in that time. He spent a couple weeks with his

138
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.300
disciples where he was teaching them training them challenging them.

139
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.300
This is in that time frame. In

140
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.600
fact, this is the first time he shows up to the

141
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.500
majority of the disciples at one time.

142
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.600
Look at verse 19.

143
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.600
On the evening of that day the first day of the week the doors being

144
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.000
locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews.

145
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.300
Jesus came and stood among them and

146
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.700
said to them peace be with you.

147
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.300
And when he had said this he showed them his hands

148
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.000
and his side.

149
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.800
Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord and

150
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.600
Jesus said to them again. Peace be

151
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:55.900
with you.

152
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.200
As the father has sent me even so I am

153
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.200
sending you.

154
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.100
By the way, this is where we get. Our our churches intentional Expressions

155
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.600
live sent you are

156
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.500
sent you hear us say that all the time it's in our mission statement.

157
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.500
This is from this phrase. It's by

158
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.300
extension from the disciples to us Matthew 28 can tie

159
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.300
it together to where Jesus sent his disciples. So

160
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.700
then we also have been sent by Jesus.

161
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.900
But notice what just happened here.

162
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.000
We saw it last week. If you were here. We were walking through the Book of Mark

163
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.400
and and what we saw there was all the

164
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.300
disciples had abandoned Jesus in the garden the night

165
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.800
before he was crucified at his arrest they ran

166
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.000
away, but here just a couple days later. They're still

167
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
scared.

168
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.300
Right there. They're hiding in this room locking the door.

169
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.400
Let's get him a little Grace though here.

170
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.100
Because think about it their leader had just been killed.

171
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.200
They didn't know he'd been resurrected yet.

172
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.700
Their leader was dead. The whole religious establishment was

173
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.100
after them like they were a part of this

174
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.400
Insurrection. And so

175
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.000
They're scared. But do you see do you

176
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.000
see the grace of Jesus here?

177
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.300
the grace of Jesus in just showing up

178
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.800
the grace of Jesus to to prove

179
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.200
to them his resurrection because if

180
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.300
you read through the rest of the New Testament, you know that this whole

181
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.200
thing we're doing here it rises and falls on whether

182
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.400
Jesus is alive or not.

183
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.000
That's why Easter matters so much that this thing would fall

184
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.400
apart if Jesus had stayed in the Tomb. It's

185
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.200
really pointless for us to do what we're doing here if he stayed in the

186
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.300
Tomb, that's why it shows his grace.

187
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.900
To them to just show up.

188
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.300
But as he did this notice he did he said something

189
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:55.800
twice.

190
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.300
He said peace be with you.

191
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.000
And why did he say it two times?

192
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.100
first of all

193
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.400
Because these men were in a room and the doors

194
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.200
were locked and all of a sudden Jesus just appeared.

195
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.100
Like we don't know if he teleported in walk through the wall.

196
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.200
We don't know right and so that would be terrifying if a man

197
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.400
just shows up in the room with you and so they needed.

198
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:22.800
Peace.

199
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.000
Peace be with you. Don't be scared.

200
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.600
But also because of the context remember what I just described earlier.

201
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.800
Like we see the grace of Jesus showing up to these when

202
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.500
life was in chaos.

203
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.000
Their Futures uncertain at this point. They don't know

204
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.400
what's going to happen next. And so Jesus says, I'm

205
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.800
going to give you my peace.

206
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.400
And notice he didn't do that by changing their circumstances.

207
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.200
He gave them his Peace by giving himself.

208
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.300
He shows up and says peace be with you.

209
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.500
That's what he said back in John 14:27. He said Peace I leave

210
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.200
with you my peace. I give to you not as

211
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.400
the world gives do I give it to you? Let not your

212
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.700
hearts be troubled neither. Let them be afraid.

213
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.700
He gives peace in a different way that we think peace is like no war

214
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.400
no fighting. He says no pieces me.

215
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:23.700
Me with you.

216
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.300
Okay, so you're thinking that's great and all but but these

217
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.400
guys.

218
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.900
They were just seeing things, right?

219
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.500
I mean, they desperately wanted Jesus to be alive and so their mind

220
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.200
was playing tricks with them and they saw him right? They they thought they

221
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.000
saw him at least.

222
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.200
No, Jesus was really with them

223
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.200
because that's what he did when he allowed them

224
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.400
to see the wounds in his wrists and the the

225
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.200
big wound in his side where the spear went in. They they

226
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.900
saw it.

227
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.700
And that's why it led to great joy to

228
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.500
gladness in their hearts. Why because

229
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.100
they knew it was really him.

230
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.300
That he's alive and like

231
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.600
this is good news for them right there. They are terrified and

232
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.700
now their leaders alive again what great news

233
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.200
that is

234
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.400
now I know.

235
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.500
That's some of you may struggle to believe that that really happened.

236
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.100
That Jesus really has been resurrected from the grave because that doesn't make

237
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.200
any sense in your brain that somebody's dead and then they can just come back to life.

238
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.900
That doesn't happen.

239
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.400
Well, you're not alone in that doubt.

240
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.000
Look down at verse 24.

241
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.600
Now Thomas, this is a little bit later after that scene Thomas. One

242
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.500
of the twelve called the twin another name

243
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.500
for him was not with them. When Jesus came

244
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.800
that first time in the the locked room Thomas wasn't

245
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.200
there and so the other disciples told him Hey

246
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.500
Thomas, we've seen the Lord.

247
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.300
But Thomas said to them unless I see

248
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.400
in his hands the mark of the nails placed my finger

249
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.600
into the mark of the nails.

250
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.600
And place my hand into his side. I will

251
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.200
never believe.

252
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.000
Now we tend to give old doubting Thomas here a lot of grief.

253
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.300
But just a few days or hours even earlier don't you

254
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.400
recognize that the disciples themselves needed the

255
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.300
confirmation to?

256
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.200
Right this that they thought it might have been some kind

257
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.400
of ghost or appearance of some sort and until they

258
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.600
saw his hands and his side. They didn't believe that's

259
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.300
when they had to gladness.

260
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.800
So Thomas here just needed another step

261
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.300
of assurance. It wasn't any different than

262
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.100
the original disciples needed. He just he wanted to actually

263
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.400
touch the scars and and feel those

264
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.200
things that Jesus really was real.

265
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.600
Well, look at how round two plays out.

266
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.800
Seeing God's grace.

267
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.500
again

268
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.100
Look at verse 26.

269
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.600
eight days later

270
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.200
His disciples were inside again. So we don't know if

271
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.400
they're locked if it's hiding again, but at least they were inside a

272
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.200
room and Thomas was with them this time, although the doors

273
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.300
were locked. So there it is. They were locked. They're still scared. Jesus

274
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.400
came and stood among them.

275
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.500
And said peace be with you now

276
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.400
again, he just shows up out of

277
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.600
nowhere. So they're terrified. Peace be with you again. So

278
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.000
there it is.

279
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.800
But you can imagine in this scene.

280
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.600
Jesus turning as he appears turning

281
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.000
to a stunned and Silent Thomas.

282
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:02.900
And walking over.

283
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.500
to Thomas

284
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.600
watch verse 27

285
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.300
and then he said to Thomas.

286
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.000
Put your finger here. See my hands.

287
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.500
Put out your hand place it in my side.

288
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.400
Do not disbelieve but believe.

289
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.400
What Grace right?

290
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.400
Jesus showed up and and met Thomas where

291
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:31.600
he was.

292
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.900
Thomas even in his doubts in

293
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.500
his concerns in his questions Jesus

294
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.100
showed up and met Thomas right in the middle of those. He

295
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.300
said Hey Thomas look even even touch this

296
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.700
Thomas she feel free to touch this.

297
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.400
now we don't know if Thomas actually did follow through

298
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.100
with touching his hands and his side but doesn't say

299
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.600
But Watch What Happens verse 28?

300
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.400
Thomas answered him

301
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.700
my Lord and my God.

302
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.900
One of the greatest Declarations of truth from anyone's

303
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.500
mouth and all of God's word.

304
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.400
my Lord

305
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.200
meeting my authority my owner the one

306
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.400
in charge of my life.

307
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.500
And my God, he says my my God a phrase

308
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.000
reserved for Yahweh in the Jews minds

309
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.100
and so is as Thomas says that he

310
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.800
equates Jesus with the father with Yahweh.

311
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.900
My Lord and my God.

312
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.100
Now again, I know you might be sitting there wavering and

313
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.800
wondering whether you can believe this.

314
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.900
And and you're looking at this and you're saying oh, of course Thomas believed.

315
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.400
I mean he could literally touch Jesus. He saw him

316
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.900
face to face. Of course Thomas believed. How can I believe

317
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.300
Well, Jesus spoke directly to

318
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:08.500
you.

319
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.800
in the next verse

320
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.400
verse 29 look at this

321
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.500
Jesus said to Thomas have you believed because you have seen

322
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:18.800
me.

323
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.500
Blessed are those who have

324
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.600
not seen?

325
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.300
And yet have believed.

326
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.300
He was talking to you friend.

327
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.400
He was talking to you.

328
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.400
He's calling you and me to believe as

329
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:41.400
well.

330
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.400
He's calling you and me to believe even though that we have not seen him

331
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.700
face to face, even though he never promises to

332
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.100
show up in your room physically when you ask him to.

333
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.900
Even though he's not walking around on the earth on in physical

334
00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.500
form anymore today. We still Must Believe

335
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.800
In The Resurrection.

336
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.400
We still must believe this and remember when we say belief we're

337
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.500
talking about mentally agreeing to the facts of

338
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.900
the Resurrection. Yes, but also even

339
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.200
more staking your whole future on it.

340
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.600
It's turning from all your sin and your stuff and

341
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.500
yourself that keeps you from Jesus.

342
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.300
And it's turning to him as

343
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.600
Lord in faith that he has done enough

344
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.000
for your eternity.

345
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.100
That's belief.

346
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.100
That's how you are saved from the penalty of

347
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.800
your sin.

348
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.100
Romans 10:9 says that if you confess with

349
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.300
your mouth that Jesus is Lord.

350
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.300
And believe in your heart that God raised him from the

351
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.200
dead you will be saved.

352
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.800
That's how you are saved and

353
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.000
so believe friend.

354
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.100
Like Thomas did confess Jesus as the Lord

355
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.800
of your life as your God believe that

356
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.400
you are a sinner in need of a Salvation that

357
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.400
you can never offer yourself that you can never provide yourself.

358
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.100
confess and believe

359
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:24.700
because when you do

360
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.100
when you do turn from yourself and turn it

361
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.700
to your savior, here's what you receive you receive his

362
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.200
forgiveness.

363
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.500
When you believe in him?

364
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.600
You receive his forgiveness. Remember we're looking at aspects

365
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.600
unique to John and there's a incredibly powerful

366
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.200
picture of this.

367
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.700
It's in the next chapter chapter 21.

368
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.300
Which is a post-resurrection scene it's after again

369
00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.900
the resurrection, but it's exclusive to John.

370
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.600
Where the disciples had kind of gone back to their previous lives?

371
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.500
They were unsure what to do next because they they hadn't

372
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.500
been instructed what to do. And so they were just sort of living their lives

373
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.600
and walking through it all and many of them were fishermen.

374
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.000
So they go kind of back to that and one of them one night

375
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.100
they were out fishing and they were catching

376
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:19.300
nothing.

377
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.400
And a stranger stood on the shore and he yelled at

378
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.600
them to put their Nets on the other side of the boat and see what happens. And

379
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.400
so they're like, okay we do and they catch loads of

380
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.400
fish 153 actually exactly.

381
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.300
And they quickly figure out that that's Jesus over there. And so they

382
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.900
hurry over to the shore.

383
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.900
Jesus was already cooking them breakfast on the shore.

384
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.900
but I want you to remember something here just

385
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.300
Just days earlier.

386
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.700
These same men had abandoned Jesus

387
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.400
in the garden.

388
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.200
They'd run away at the first sign of

389
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.000
trouble. They left him on his own peter even later

390
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.400
denied that he even knew Jesus

391
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.600
three separate times.

392
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.100
Well after they ate on the shore together it was

393
00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.000
time for a conversation.

394
00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.400
This is John chapter 21 starting down in verse 15.

395
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.600
When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon

396
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.500
Peter Simon, son of John. Do you love me more

397
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.500
than these?

398
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.200
And Peter said to Jesus. Yes, Lord. You know that. I

399
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.500
love you.

400
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.500
He said to him feed my Lambs.

401
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.200
He said to him a second time Simon son of John do you

402
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.500
love me?

403
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.500
He said to him. Yes, Lord. You know that. I love you.

404
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.900
Jesus said to Peter 10 my sheep.

405
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.400
He said to him the third time Simon son

406
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.300
of John do you love me?

407
00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.000
And Peter was grieved because he said to him

408
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.100
the third time do you love me?

409
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.400
And Peter said to him Lord, you know

410
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:06.900
everything.

411
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.000
You know that I love you.

412
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.600
And Jesus said to him feed my sheep.

413
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.000
So not once not twice, but three

414
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.500
times. Jesus asked Peter the

415
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.100
question. Do you love me?

416
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.700
And not once not twice, but three times Peter responded.

417
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.400
Of course. I love you Jesus.

418
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.100
Now, why did Jesus ask Peter three times?

419
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.200
Bible doesn't say explicitly here, but think about

420
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:44.400
it.

421
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.300
Remember how many times Peter denied Jesus?

422
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.200
three times

423
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.700
I think this moment was Jesus redeeming and

424
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.000
restoring and forgiving Peter.

425
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.900
Because notice first Jesus reconfirmed the relationship here.

426
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.200
Because implied in jesus' question

427
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.300
of Peter. Hey, Peter. Do you love me is the

428
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.100
Priceless reassurance because I

429
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.200
still love you Peter.

430
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.200
By Jesus wouldn't ask that question. If he didn't

431
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.800
love Peter first down notice Jesus didn't chastise

432
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.400
Peter. He didn't rehash what happened.

433
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.700
He didn't give Peter the cold shoulder, but

434
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.700
he also didn't blow it off as no big deal.

435
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.400
No, Jesus affirmed his love

436
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.600
for Peter and he gave Peter the opportunity to

437
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.400
affirm his love back.

438
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.100
to say to Jesus Lord

439
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.100
like Thomas just did.

440
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.000
But listen, this is what Jesus Does.

441
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.600
For any who come to him in faith?

442
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.800
This scene no matter what you've done no matter how far

443
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.200
you've gone. Jesus comes after

444
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:07.500
you.

445
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.400
Jesus does what he does, he paid

446
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.300
the price to forgive you and praise God

447
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.300
he did that because there's no other way out of it for us

448
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.000
in our sin.

449
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.400
forgives

450
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.200
but listen, here's what I often happens at this point.

451
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.100
See for most of you. That's not new information.

452
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.300
None of what I've said is new like if you've been an Easter Service

453
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.100
before, you know that Jesus died and Jesus rose again.

454
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.300
You know that Jesus forgives sin, you know

455
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.100
that Jesus is the savior.

456
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.700
But do you know why?

457
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.400
Do you know why he saves?

458
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.800
Why he forgives?

459
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.200
Why he redeems?

460
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.300
Is it just to give us Heaven someday?

461
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.200
Is it just for us to kind of lazily sit around here and

462
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.100
wait for him to return and take us to Heaven? Is that is

463
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:12.900
that why he saves us?

464
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.900
Mr. Sounds like we talked about that a lot that way.

465
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.700
Which will get a cushy life because of this and cushy eternities

466
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.600
that why he saves no.

467
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.400
Did you notice what else Jesus did with Peter

468
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.700
here in John 21?

469
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.000
Not only did he Recon the relationship.

470
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.400
He also reconfirmed Peter's purpose.

471
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.400
because after each affirmation of Love Came a

472
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.600
form of this command from Jesus

473
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.800
feed my sheep.

474
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.500
Now this is not new information to Peter because

475
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.500
even just a few chapters earlier at the

476
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.700
the scene where they were having the Passover meal

477
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.200
together Jesus even predicted Peter's

478
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.900
denials.

479
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.200
Yet he also added this.

480
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.700
Hey Peter, when you have turned again strengthen

481
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.000
your brothers.

482
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.300
See Jesus knew Peter would

483
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:22.600
fall.

484
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.400
But Jesus also knew that Peter would repent

485
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.000
and Peter would recommit his life to the

486
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:30.700
mission of God.

487
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.700
Again, this is what Jesus Does.

488
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.400
These same guys who last week ran away

489
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.700
in fear. They were hiding. He then restored

490
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.500
them and redeemed them

491
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.200
through his death and Resurrection for their

492
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:48.700
sin.

493
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.600
He knew they were all going to run.

494
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.900
And he still went to the Cross. He still resurrected to

495
00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.500
overcome their sin and your sin as

496
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.500
well. Listen, it's the same for you and me today.

497
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.100
We run from God.

498
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.000
Yes, Jesus restores by faith.

499
00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.100
But hear me again, Jesus did all of that.

500
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.400
Not for us to just live cushy lives.

501
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.800
and to be decent American citizens

502
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.500
and to sit here every week and listen to Somebody talk for

503
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.300
45 minutes up here. That's not the whole point

504
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:29.800
of this thing.

505
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.500
He did all of that so that we

506
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.200
would be committed to his mission committed to

507
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.600
his purpose committed to him Above All Else. He

508
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.600
loved us and saved us so that we would pursue

509
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.700
his kingdom now.

510
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.500
That's that's what he does. He gives forgiveness so that

511
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.900
we would pursue his kingdom so that we would seek

512
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.500
first the kingdom of God and

513
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.400
his righteousness.

514
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.200
So Jesus said back in Matthew 6:33, that's what he

515
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.600
wants for us to do and I know that's daunting

516
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.400
you think about your life like okay seeking first the king in

517
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.000
everything I have to do this, but that's part of what I skipped

518
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.000
it a little bit earlier in John chapter 20 verse 22 where

519
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.700
Jesus plants his spirit in

520
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.600
his followers so that they can live

521
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.900
out what he's calling them to live out.

522
00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.100
It's the power source to be able to do this.

523
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.400
So there's that we can't forget, but I also want you to see something here.

524
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.500
It's really important. Did you see that Peter was to

525
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.200
follow this purpose?

526
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.300
Feed my sheep this purpose of God this mission of

527
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.000
God. He was to do that not out of

528
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.900
obligation.

529
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.500
But out of love for Jesus.

530
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.700
Peter do you love me?

531
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.200
If you love me feed my sheep.

532
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.200
If you love me follow me, if you love

533
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.700
me. Obey me it's the same for us.

534
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.500
See because he first loved us.

535
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.600
We are to love him with everything. We are

536
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.300
we are to give our lives for what he wants

537
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.400
for what his design and his plan

538
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.400
is in the world.

539
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.400
We are then to live for something bigger than ourselves

540
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.500
bigger than just a little bit better life here

541
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.100
or bigger than getting our own selfish way and how

542
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.300
we want our lives to be on this Earth. No, it's

543
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.200
something so much bigger. It's what Jesus himself said

544
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.300
back in John chapter

545
00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.700
18.

546
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.300
So take just a quick glance over there

547
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.600
back to the left a little bit of scroll up a little bit John chapter 18.

548
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.200
We'll show you this.

549
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.600
John 18 starting in verse 33

550
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.800
Again, this is another scene unique to John.

551
00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.300
John 18:33, this was Jesus back before

552
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.600
he was crucified. He's dialoguing with the Roman leader

553
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.600
pilot that he's talking about how he's been

554
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.900
accused of insurrection.

555
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.300
But look at how he responds to Pilate.

556
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.300
John 18 starting in verse 33 so

557
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.500
pilot entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and

558
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.300
said to him. Are you the king of the

559
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:23.800
Jews?

560
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.200
And Jesus answered kind of getting to Pilots heart. Do you

561
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.500
say this of your own accord or did others

562
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.300
say it to you about me?

563
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.500
Pilot answered it. Well, am I a Jew your own nation

564
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.300
and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have

565
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:41.600
you done?

566
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.500
And Jesus answered my kingdom is not of

567
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.200
this world.

568
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.200
If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would

569
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.600
have been fighting.

570
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.100
That I might not be delivered over to the Jews,

571
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.600
but my kingdom is not from the

572
00:30:59.600 --> 00:30:59.900
world.

573
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.200
Now what pilot was doing was trying to figure out if he should be worried about

574
00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.200
a political rival here.

575
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.300
Because Rome is going to squash that really fast.

576
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.100
But Jesus was saying that his kingdom.

577
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.200
Is infinitely higher than Rome's Kingdom.

578
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.500
That there's no political rival here because Rome gets

579
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.400
squashed compared to the

580
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.300
kingdom of God, but what did Jesus mean here? What is

581
00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.900
this Kingdom? He's talking about this other worldly Kingdom.

582
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:33.100
Well,

583
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.600
it's everywhere that Jesus rules and Reigns as

584
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.500
Lord.

585
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.100
Now one day fully and finally on Earth that will

586
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:44.300
happen.

587
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.100
But until that day comes it's in

588
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.900
the hearts and lives of believers.

589
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.800
That's why Jesus can say in John 17 that his followers are

590
00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.400
not of the world.

591
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.900
We're of a different Kingdom and it's why the Colossians

592
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.400
1 verses 13 and 14 says this here's

593
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.700
the reason because he has delivered us from the

594
00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.900
domain of darkness and transferred us

595
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.600
to the kingdom of his beloved Son

596
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.300
in whom we have Redemption the Forgiveness of sins.

597
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.300
Like that means that we are citizens of a new

598
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.600
kingdom if we believe.

599
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.600
Now we still live here. We still have bodies are still National boundaries and

600
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.400
borders on Earth. Yes, but Jesus wasn't talking

601
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.300
about a location here.

602
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.400
He's talking about how the authority and

603
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.400
power of his kingdom are derived from a source

604
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.400
outside of this world.

605
00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.400
It's not from the battle. That's why he says my followers would

606
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.100
have been fighting but this is not where my Kingdom lives.

607
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.500
It's not a national geopolitical entity. This

608
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.200
is something that is an eternal

609
00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.300
Authority that I am the Sovereign God is what he's saying

610
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.400
over all things and so

611
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.400
My kingdom is not just here.

612
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.200
Here's what that means.

613
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.500
If we are members of his

614
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.500
kingdom by faith.

615
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.000
If we are followers of Jesus.

616
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.800
Then his authority supersedes all other authority on

617
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.400
this Earth.

618
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.800
My kingdom is not of this world. This

619
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.100
world then means for us that this is

620
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.600
not our home.

621
00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:36.700
And we owe our allegiance to our true home to

622
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.400
our ultimate authority to King Jesus

623
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:39.900
himself.

624
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.000
That that's our Authority that means here this our value

625
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.300
systems should be different than the worlds. Our

626
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.700
Behavior should be different our response

627
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.900
to fools online should be different.

628
00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.500
Are use of money should be different.

629
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.800
Our love for our enemies should be different our faithfulness in

630
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.300
marriage should be different. Our parenting should be

631
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.400
different our lives today because we're

632
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.800
citizens of a new kingdom should be a foretaste of

633
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.200
what is coming one day fully and finally on Earth.

634
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.600
When Jesus the king descends after he ascended

635
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.700
we'll talk about that next week, but the descending of Jesus back

636
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.500
to Earth to reign as king over all things, that's

637
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.600
fully and finally we get a we get to be a foretaste

638
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.300
of that a practice session of what's coming

639
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:30.800
someday.

640
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.200
Again, why?

641
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.100
Because we serve a Risen Savior King named Jesus.

642
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.600
That our King cannot be defeated because he defeated

643
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.300
sin on the cross. He defeated death in

644
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.500
his resurrection. And he's one day coming back to Reign Over

645
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.400
All Things fully and finally, he's a

646
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.900
savior King who gives us the opportunity to join

647
00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.000
in his Kingdom Purpose is even today.

648
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.300
How stunning is that?

649
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.900
And we get to live out the kingdom principles.

650
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.900
And so friend listen carefully.

651
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.500
the question on the table is this

652
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.400
Who do you say that? Jesus is?

653
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.500
Whether you've never been to church ever in your life, or maybe you've

654
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.600
been in church your entire life.

655
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.300
What is your declaration about who Jesus is?

656
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.400
number Peter

657
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.700
said to Jesus Lord, you know everything.

658
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.500
remember Thomas

659
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.300
my Lord and my God.

660
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.300
But do you remember what Pilate?

661
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.700
Said to Jesus in John 18.

662
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.600
Pilate asked Jesus. Are you the king of the Jews remember what

663
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.200
Jesus said?

664
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.400
And it's the same question. He's asking you today.

665
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.400
Pilot, is that what you believe?

666
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.700
Or is that what everybody else has told you?

667
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.200
is that

668
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.000
Just what you've grown up hearing about.

669
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.000
Or is that what you really believe?

670
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.500
Is that just because you're in the atmosphere of church

671
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:32.900
world?

672
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.600
Or is that really who you say Jesus is?

673
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.300
Is that what you believe or is that just what you've heard

674
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.100
from others?

675
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.500
See today, we are inviting you to meet

676
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.300
not just an absent disinterested God.

677
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.600
We're not even inviting you to meet just a good guy who

678
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.300
sacrificed for other people because when

679
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.400
you hear those things you can refuse that very easily

680
00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.400
and doesn't really change anything in your life. No, we're inviting you

681
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.000
today to meet the reigning King of Kings.

682
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.900
We're inviting you to meet a savior who forgives

683
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.900
you through his blood and who designed

684
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.800
you to worship and to live fully for

685
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:21.900
him.

686
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.500
Anything else you and I pursue in

687
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.500
our lives will leave us unsatisfied. We'll leave

688
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.600
us unfulfilled. He designed it a certain

689
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.200
way and so hear me believe in him today.

690
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.300
Repent and believe turn from your

691
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.700
sin yourself and turn to him if maybe for the first time that would

692
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.400
be great turn from your sin and yourself and turn

693
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.100
to this Jesus in faith and trust John 1:12. He

694
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.900
starts in chapter one by saying all who received him

695
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.200
who believed in his name. He gave the right

696
00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.100
to become children of God.

697
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.100
What a blessing.

698
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.500
To be in the family of God.

699
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.100
It's through belief.

700
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.700
But also listen for every single one of us.

701
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.800
See more of who this Savior King really is.

702
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.300
Don't just let Easter pass by a death Resurrection.

703
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.600
Okay, we got all that stuff. This is who he is and take

704
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.400
a step of faith today.

705
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.300
To pursue his great Kingdom because

706
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.800
of his great love for you.
