00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.370
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.010
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

3
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.570
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth

4
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.650
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

5
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.410
When Christ who is your life appears,

6
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.650
then you will also appear with him in glory.

7
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.430
Man, did Nick do a great job with that intro video? Hey, amen. Uh,

8
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.070
just such a good reminder of the truths that we will learn and

9
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.030
be struck by as we venture into this journey through the New Testament book of

10
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.010
Colossians.

11
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.110
And so I would invite you to turn there with me if you're not already there. Uh,

12
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.310
if you want to keep that place in your Bible, we'll be in there for a long time.

13
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.990
You saw in the video that we have bookmarks out there that you can go grab right

14
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.310
under the cross. We have stickers and magnets as well. Uh, phone lock screens,

15
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.510
just kinds of things like that. Not for our logo purposes,

16
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.390
but that you would keep these things in front of you and this truth

17
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.040
of Christ above all for the next couple months, just to be reminded constantly.

18
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.960
And you'll see why as we get into it here.

19
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.770
You can also visit the new bookstore right over here. If you want to, uh,

20
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.930
get a Colossians journal.

21
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.090
You can take notes in that alongside the text of scripture there if that's for

22
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.050
you. But speaking of newness, uh, as Brandon mentioned a little bit,

23
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.490
is it not exciting to feel the life and excitement and,

24
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.290
and all kinds of things as school is about to start?

25
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.970
Some of you're not so excited about that, but, uh, most of us are. And,

26
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.570
and then the building refresh nearing completion, not fully done,

27
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.570
but almost there. I mean, I just wanna say thank you to a ton of people.

28
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.490
I can't name all of you who worked on this to get us all, uh,

29
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.290
where we are right now and how beautiful it is. Uh, but,

30
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.090
but I also wanna just stop for a second.

31
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.250
I think we need to do this and just appreciate what God has given us here. Uh,

32
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.210
I know I said last week, it's not about the stuff for the building,

33
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.330
it's about the people. But,

34
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.730
but we can still be grateful for how God has provided for

35
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.770
us in these ways where we're now debt free.

36
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.250
Where we were also able, the,

37
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.250
the chairs you're sitting on obviously aren't broken in. They're brand new. Uh,

38
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.050
the older chairs that had been broken in for about 20 years, uh,

39
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.410
we were able to bless other churches with and other ministries.

40
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.370
And so the kingdom, as Psalm 67, very clearly says,

41
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.330
we are blessed to be a blessing.

42
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.610
And so God gave us so we can give.

43
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.090
And that's an incredible truth to remember as a church, as we go forward.

44
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.730
We're blessed to be a blessing.

45
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.370
But as we look ahead to this journey through Colossians,

46
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.850
apart from a couple special weeks over the next, uh, couple months,

47
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.050
it's gonna be a journey straight through the book. Uh,

48
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.530
we'll start today and we'll end right before Thanksgiving.

49
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.410
And we're gonna see its train of thought as we go through the whole thing.

50
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.930
And over those 13 weeks or so, we're going to learn the,

51
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.770
the one primary point that I hope we get. It's all over.

52
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.410
Everything that we've got, of course, it's all over the logo. You're gonna see,

53
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.770
and I hope you get this, I hope I get this into our souls,

54
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.730
is that Christ is above all,

55
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.610
like if you boil Colossians down, as as I've put that, Christ is above all,

56
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.330
he's above all other religions.

57
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.410
He's above all idols that you and I can search after he's above all of our

58
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.730
sin. He's above everything.

59
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.680
And as I've been studying this book,

60
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.320
I'm so excited to be able to share the truth of that into

61
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.720
our lives of how that changes everything.

62
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.360
What we're gonna do today though,

63
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.520
is we're gonna look at just the first two verses of the book and get our

64
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.120
bearings and what we need to know about Colossians before we venture into it's

65
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.910
depths. Now, kids,

66
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.670
there used to be these things that you would keep in your car called maps and

67
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.600
uh, they,

68
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.280
you'd get 'em from like a rest stop or somewhere else and you'd go pick it up

69
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.240
and you'd keep it in there. And, and when you picked it up, it,

70
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.520
you noticed when you first got it, it was all folded really crisply and neatly.

71
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.280
And it was just really well done from the tourism or whoever did that. The,

72
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.360
the problem was that once you unfolded it, you could never get it back together,

73
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.240
right? And so what you would do is you'd have to unfold it and look around and,

74
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.760
and as you would take it out in your car and it covers three-fourths of the

75
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.720
dash, you would put it out there and you'd say, okay, where are we?

76
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.840
We need to know where we're going. We need to have the,

77
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.760
the legend of the map to see what this, this little,

78
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.040
little figurine is. And what, what does that mean?

79
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.680
We're going here and looking for landmarks because of the map.

80
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.800
And you know where you are, you know where you're going.

81
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.630
That's what we're going to do kind of today,

82
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.390
is we're gonna unfold the map of Colossians and lay it on the table and say,

83
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.830
okay, where do we need to go? Where are we going?

84
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.950
What does it tell us about this letter?

85
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.110
So we get a get an a lay of the land of Colossians.

86
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.390
So there will be a little bit of academic side of this.

87
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.470
We're gonna have to go through just some details of things.

88
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.870
I know it's super easy to check out when you start to get to that academic

89
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.190
world, but, but listen,

90
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.950
these things are really important for us to understand how

91
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.750
Colossians works and why it says what it says.

92
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.880
So we need to follow through with that.

93
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.480
And you'll see it right here as we begin in verses one and two,

94
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.320
looking for Christ above all,

95
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.100
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God and Timothy,

96
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.113
our brother,

97
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.580
to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae grace to you and peace

98
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.530
from God, our Father, God, even in these short verses,

99
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.870
deeply impact our hearts. Show us what you want us to see here.

100
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.030
Set up the rest of our study through Colossians,

101
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.550
where this truth of Christ above all would change us deeply.

102
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.280
Holy Spirit, I can't do that. We can't do that. I can't say enough.

103
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.440
You need to speak through your word today and every day.

104
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.030
Thank you that you promise whenever we preach your word and we study your word,

105
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.630
that you'll meet us there. We pray you would today in Jesus' name. Amen.

106
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.350
So first things first, as with any letter, we need to know who wrote it. Uh,

107
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.350
when you get a letter at home, same thing. Who wrote this? Now,

108
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.670
ancient letters were a little bit different than the way we write ours today.

109
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.870
You write a letter today started with like, dear Bill, right?

110
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.670
And then you write the letter and you sign it at the bottom.

111
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.950
The ancient letters would often start with the name of the author at the

112
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.670
beginning as a way to greet the reader and as a way to validate authenticity.

113
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.030
So they pick up this parchment and they see the name of the author right at the

114
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.390
beginning. They know they can trust it. And so that's what we see here, right?

115
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.240
Paul is mentioned straight away as one of the authors.

116
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.990
So Paul was here. Now here's, here's a bit of a side note. Paul probably was,

117
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.910
was dictating these words to ascribe 'cause we believe Paul was in prison at

118
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.950
this time, probably chained up in prison.

119
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.670
So you can't really write very well when you got chains on.

120
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.510
So he's saying these words to somebody else and they're writing it.

121
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:22.030
But that doesn't cause us to doubt the authenticity of this because look at the

122
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.950
very end. Just turn a page over, very end of chapter four, verse eight.

123
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.630
Verse 18 says,

124
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.910
I Paul write this greeting with my own hand.

125
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:38.460
Remember my chains grace, be with you. So Paul,

126
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.820
at some point he said, Hey,

127
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.740
I need to let them know that I'm actually involved here.

128
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.300
So he somehow figured out a way to, to write his own little thing.

129
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.740
I write this with my own hand. It's indifferent font.

130
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.380
It's all the things grace be with you. Remember my chains?

131
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.500
So Paul wrote, so who, who was Paul? First of all,

132
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.340
we need to know this Paul figure. Well,

133
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.260
this was the man who was formerly known as Saul,

134
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.900
who was persecuting the church initially. But then in Acts chapter nine,

135
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.900
God knocks him down, blinds him and says, no,

136
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.540
you're mine. Radically saves Paul,

137
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.240
but not only called Paul into his family, the family of God,

138
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.320
he also called Paul to be an apostle of Jesus.

139
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.160
That's the word we see here in verse one.

140
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.840
That word apostle means messenger used in a lot of different contexts,

141
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.840
but primarily the way the Bible uses it most is in reference to the original

142
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.370
12 who were with Jesus. Now, not all the 12,

143
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.050
'cause Judas didn't make it so there were 11. But then in Acts chapter one,

144
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.810
Mathias is added as one of the 12.

145
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.890
And so now they have 12 what they called apostles.

146
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.020
And so these were designated as eyewitnesses to

147
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.300
all that Jesus had said and done.

148
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.660
And they were seen as the authorities over the church at the time as the gospel

149
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.020
was going out, as letters are being written,

150
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.740
the apostles could be the ones to say, no, no, that's not of Jesus.

151
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.300
He never said that. Or yes, that's exactly what Jesus said and did.

152
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.420
Here's the gospel, here's the truth. Here's yeah, that's James.

153
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.940
He wrote that they could all kind of collectively oversee the process

154
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.270
of the gospel spreading. That was the apostles,

155
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.150
they were messengers, but they were a little bit differently. But then Paul

156
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.550
later was given the same designation.

157
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.960
The problem was that Paul wasn't directly with Jesus.

158
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.720
And so how could Paul be called an apostle too?

159
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.400
'cause he didn't actually see Jesus do any that he did. More or less.

160
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.560
We assume he didn't see anything. So how can Paul get this designation?

161
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.920
Well, remember, remember what happened on the, the road in Acts nine,

162
00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.880
Jesus shows up, even though Jesus already ascended to heaven.

163
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.160
Jesus shows up on the road, meets Paul, he transforms his life,

164
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.290
blinds him,

165
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.640
sends him away for a couple of years where Jesus then begins to teach him. Now,

166
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.320
Jesus was teaching through people all of these things, yes, but,

167
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.440
but Jesus affirmed the apostleship of Paul.

168
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.160
He says, I'm a, I'm an apostle two here. Paul says it himself. Well,

169
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.240
how can he say that? Well,

170
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.880
here's how he wrote it to the Corinthians in one Corinthians

171
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.720
chapter 15. He,

172
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.560
he's recounting his authority to preach the gospel and declare what the gospel

173
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.640
really is. He says it this way in one Corinthians 15, three through 10,

174
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.120
he says, I delivered to you as of first importance. What I also received,

175
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.760
that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures. He was buried.

176
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.440
He was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures.

177
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.760
So after his resurrection, here's what happened. Verse five,

178
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.680
he appeared to CFUs and then to the 12. That's the 12 apostles.

179
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.400
And then he appeared to more than 500 brothers at one time.

180
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.240
Most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.

181
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.160
If you want to check. It basically is why he said that.

182
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:13.200
Then he appeared to James and then to all the apostles. And last of all,

183
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.240
as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me,

184
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.680
meaning later he appeared to me, verse nine,

185
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.720
for I am the least of the apostles unworthy to be called

186
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.520
an apostle because I persecuted the church of God,

187
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.490
but by the grace of God, I am what I am.

188
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:41.090
And his grace toward me was not in vain, right?

189
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:46.050
So by the way, if you want a life verse verse 10, by the grace of God,

190
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.250
I am what I am, right?

191
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.210
That's a great one to just throw on your wall and never forget. It's nothing.

192
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.570
It's God's grace in you that brings it about. But that's what Paul is saying.

193
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.290
He didn't pull back from describing his position in Christ. He's saying,

194
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.490
I am an apostle. You guys can trust that.

195
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:06.410
But he's humble about it because he says it very clearly, this is not my work,

196
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.460
this is all God's deal. I was trying to persecute the church and God said, no,

197
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.420
you're mine and I'm gonna use you in powerful ways.

198
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.510
So he knew it was by God's will, it was through God's work.

199
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.550
But he wanted to state his credentials to these colossian Christians because

200
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.573
they didn't know him.

201
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.980
We believe that most likely Paul never visited Colossae. So he,

202
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.460
they didn't know him personally. So they're, they're having to,

203
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.740
to trust his position. Most likely.

204
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.700
We believe Eris was the one who planted the church in Colossae when,

205
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.020
when Paul was in Ephesus, which is close by in Acts 19,

206
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.540
he probably sent Ariss who was from Colossae.

207
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.020
He sent him to his hometown and said, Hey, go preach the gospel over there.

208
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.320
We'll see Ariss show up all throughout the book.

209
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.730
But Paul was like, Hey guys, listen,

210
00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.690
you need to know what you're hearing and reading from me.

211
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:06.150
You can trust it because God called me to be an apostle.

212
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.470
And so he's introducing himself. But notice even in his introduction,

213
00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.900
even as Paul stands up and says to these people, yeah,

214
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.500
I'm an apostle of Christ Jesus.

215
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.690
He's not bragging in that what he's doing is even there.

216
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.970
The focus is on Christ.

217
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:30.240
I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.

218
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.040
Like the focus is not on Paul's position. The focus is on God himself.

219
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.960
It's on Christ.

220
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.680
The emphasis is on following Jesus. He's like, I'm not just, I'm an apostle.

221
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.760
He's like, I'm an apostle of Christ by his grace, by his work,

222
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.400
I'm an apostle of Christ.

223
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.750
But we also see another name here we see Timothy,

224
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.990
and this is used as another author, Paul and Timothy,

225
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.070
another author of this letter to the Colossians. Now,

226
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.070
if we wanna be really technical,

227
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.310
we could also add the Holy Spirit as a third 'cause Holy Spirit inspired this

228
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:16.030
'cause scripture for us. We would assume that, that we know that's true. But,

229
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.230
but as far as who wrote it down, in a sense,

230
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.830
we don't know the extent of Timothy's involvement, but we know he's with Paul.

231
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.750
Clearly, maybe Timothy was adding in a few things that needed to be said or,

232
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.150
or not. Maybe it's right. Maybe he was the scribe that Paul was using.

233
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.270
We have no idea.

234
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.470
But Paul referring to Timothy as our brother

235
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:41.950
would've given Timothy credibility with the Colossians saying, Hey guys,

236
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:46.390
you can trust Timothy just like you can trust me. He's our brother.

237
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.280
Now, just as a side note, as I go forward, I,

238
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.880
I'm not gonna say Paul and Timothy every time,

239
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.960
it's gotta save some time and some words along the way here,

240
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.720
I'm just gonna say Paul, but I mean both, right?

241
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.370
So you can see why I'm gonna base it there. But that's who wrote it.

242
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.020
But then to whom did they write it? Okay, we need to know who wrote it,

243
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.390
who received it. Well, I've already hinted at that several times.

244
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:17.220
It's verse two says, it's to the Colossian Christians. Right?

245
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.500
To the Colossian Christians is who they wrote it to. That's what verse two says,

246
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.333
right

247
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.700
to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae,

248
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.100
Paul and Timothy to the saints and faithful brothers at Colossi.

249
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.180
Now, a couple things here to help you understand like how to read your Bible.

250
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.020
That's what we're doing here. I know most translations, yours probably does.

251
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.100
Mine does says brothers to the brothers, faithful brothers.

252
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.340
But,

253
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:50.280
but this letter was not merely written to the men in the church or

254
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.680
even just to a smaller group of men in the church.

255
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.000
'cause later in chapter four it says, this letter is to be read.

256
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.720
When the whole church is gathered together,

257
00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.490
which would've included both men and women and children.

258
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.610
It would've had everybody together.

259
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.970
That's why you might never have understood why this is there.

260
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.770
There might be a little super script,

261
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.610
kind of looks like an exponential if you're in math, right?

262
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.690
A little one or an a next to that word, brothers,

263
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.530
you can see it really tiny there.

264
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.560
That's to point you to something down at the very bottom of the page or to

265
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.960
click on it if it's your digital version.

266
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.120
So when you see to the saints and faithful brothers,

267
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.760
you see the one or a it points you down to the bottom.

268
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.320
And here's what this says in my Bible,

269
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.280
something similar to yours or brothers and sisters

270
00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.360
in New Testament usage, depending on the context,

271
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.920
the plural Greek word adelphoi translated brothers here

272
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.240
may refer either to brothers or to brothers and sisters.

273
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.390
And so that's what this is saying,

274
00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.350
that sometimes this word in Greek is translated brothers,

275
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.070
sometimes just men. Other times,

276
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.950
most oftentimes it's both men and women together,

277
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:12.430
kind of a group of people, mankind altogether.

278
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.110
And we know that's true that this was for the whole church because later in

279
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.150
chapter four, Paul even addresses women by name within the church.

280
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.500
So again, this is for the church.

281
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:29.460
This is not a personal correspondence. This is for the body together.

282
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.850
A second thing here has to do with the separation in verse two of saints from

283
00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.810
faithful ones, brothers and sisters, saints and faithful. So,

284
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.570
so is Paul here. This, this has happened.

285
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.170
Is he creating a class structure within the church?

286
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.210
Like you've got these extra super holy people over here called saints,

287
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.810
and then you've got people just making it over here, right? The faithful,

288
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.540
faithful ones. No, he's not doing that.

289
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:05.300
He's merely using theological language to describe the people within

290
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.393
the church

291
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.230
to the saints and faithful ones.

292
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.590
He's saying to the hearers, the church gathered, he's saying, guys,

293
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:19.230
you are made holy ones by Christ,

294
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:24.310
you are saints, by Christ. You're forgiven, you're washed clean.

295
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.670
He actually said it to the first, in the first Corinthians,

296
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.350
he said it to that church, to the church of God.

297
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:34.070
That's in Corinth to those sanctified, that means washed clean in Christ.

298
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:38.870
Jesus called to be saints together with all those

299
00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.430
who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

300
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.110
both their Lord and ours.

301
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.680
So there's no room in the church for a special class

302
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.360
of Christian called saints.

303
00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.870
You are a saint. If you're a Christian,

304
00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.790
you are positionally in Christ. You are positionally,

305
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.270
holy, sanctified, washed, clean.

306
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.110
You have no fear to stand before God if you are in Christ.

307
00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.600
And so again, what's he doing here?

308
00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.760
He's emphasizing Christ above all.

309
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.440
Because those people know as they're hearing this, they're like, no,

310
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.200
I just yesterday blew it, right? I knew I messed up.

311
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.020
I'm not a saint. But he says to them, no, you actually are.

312
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.700
And in fact, not only are you a saint,

313
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.650
you're also a faithful one because that sainthood,

314
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.810
that holiness creates something.

315
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.210
It creates a response that you are now living a faithful life.

316
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.330
'cause he's heard as we'll see next week,

317
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.850
he's heard about the way they're living.

318
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.050
He's heard about how the colossian Christians are standing fast for the gospel.

319
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.650
And he's like, GA, listen, you are faithful.

320
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.450
You're a saint in Christ and you are a faithful one.

321
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.553
It's kinda like this.

322
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.540
You know those times when you're really down on yourself and,

323
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.100
and you've been just kind of beat up by the enemy and,

324
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.500
and you feel just kind of so far from grace,

325
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.060
you're so far from God and you've, you feel that reality and all you can think,

326
00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.420
and all you're hearing in your mind is these negativity,

327
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.620
these negative thoughts.

328
00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:29.370
And then you get that email or that text from a faithful

329
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:34.110
brother or sister who just reminds you of who they

330
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.740
know you to be in Christ of what they've seen in you.

331
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.160
How encouraging is that? Right? Like you, you've, you've felt that you've,

332
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.280
you hope you've received that at some point where, where you're just down and,

333
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.600
and you pull up your phone. And that,

334
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.280
that brother from six years ago has sent you a text saying, man,

335
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.200
I just want you to know how much an impact you made in my life when you

336
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.160
discipled me for those six months. We spent time together.

337
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.400
And I just look at you as a faithful follower of Jesus.

338
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.760
And I look up to you so much.

339
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.520
Thank you for being follower of Christ like you are.

340
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.500
And all you've thought is, I'm worthless. I'm nothing.

341
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.220
This is what Paul's doing here to start the letter.

342
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.040
If you're feeling down, Colossians, if you're feeling beat up, Colossians,

343
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.520
if you're feeling far from God, Colossians, remember who you are.

344
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:26.160
That's so important for us, isn't it? Remember who you are in Christ,

345
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.600
you are holy, you are his, and he makes you faithful.

346
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.060
So don't forget that

347
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.290
as we trace this map of Colossians, though,

348
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:45.240
the next study of it begins to get a little deeper as we think about this

349
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:49.600
next question. What did they write? Saw who wrote it?

350
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.160
And we saw then what they wrote or uh, who they wrote it to.

351
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.830
What did they write? Well,

352
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:58.670
look again in verse two,

353
00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:02.670
it says To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae grace to you

354
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.390
and peace from God, our Father,

355
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.410
this was following the customary pattern of letters 2000 years ago.

356
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.410
The author gave their name and then they gave a greeting or they gave a

357
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.050
blessing. But Paul didn't follow it perfectly here.

358
00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.850
He adjusted it slightly from the usual Greek word re which

359
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.970
means greetings. Like, Hey, what's up guys?

360
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:29.930
That's how they would typically start to the distinctly Christian word

361
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.390
here, chorus, which is grace.

362
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.130
Not just hi grace to you.

363
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.730
It's the same structure.

364
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.410
He started nearly every of one of his letters with grace to you and peace from

365
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.290
God. Our Father, sometimes he adds Lord Jesus Christ too. But he,

366
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.530
he's wanting people to hear something different than every other letter they

367
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.010
received. But I don't think he's just greeting him here.

368
00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:00.460
I don't think he's just using this as a way to introduce the letter.

369
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.660
I think he is even now giving a summary of his life

370
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.380
and ministry, a summary of the gospel.

371
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.570
Because first, what's the word? He uses? Grace.

372
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.500
He says Grace to you.

373
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.810
Now that word grace means God's unmerited favor.

374
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.580
That it's a free gift of favor and love for you.

375
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.760
That means we don't deserve it. That means we can never earn it.

376
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.690
And so when you think about it that way,

377
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.010
that means grace is like a one word summary of the gospel, right?

378
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.610
This is just it. It's God's grace to us. It's what Ephesians two says,

379
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.530
by grace, you have been saved through faith.

380
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.930
And this is not your own doing. It's the gift of God,

381
00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.240
not a result of works so that no one can boast.

382
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.550
It's a gift. It's grace, it's salvation.

383
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.420
Listen, it's still blows my mind

384
00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:16.430
that because of my rebellion against God,

385
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.910
turning my back on him and saying, I'm gonna do it my way because of that,

386
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.550
what I deserve is God's wrath.

387
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.270
And nothing I could ever do could fix that problem.

388
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:37.563
Yet

389
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:45.080
the holy God of the universe would love sinful me

390
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.360
enough to take that wrath that I deserved

391
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.720
and instead pour it out onto his son on the cross.

392
00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:01.050
Like that should just blow our minds, right?

393
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.160
What, what other truth like that is,

394
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.960
that is so glorious

395
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.510
Christ above all then, right? Like if that's what he's done,

396
00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.430
if grace is what he's given me, then Christ, nothing else is needed.

397
00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.950
Just that Christ above all. But

398
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:29.050
there's actually more grace, but also peace. He says,

399
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.970
grace to you and peace from God our Father.

400
00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.600
So peace. What's that definition here would be defined as reconciliation,

401
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.950
unmerited, favor and grace. Reconciliation in peace.

402
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.570
And this word is often tied back to the Old Testament word, shalom.

403
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.610
When like everything is right. That's peace in that sense.

404
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:59.050
And that is true to an extent, but even fuller than that, this word peace,

405
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:03.490
the way it's used here is to illustrate the relationship with God

406
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.290
that you now have through Christ.

407
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.550
That's even better than just everything working out right?

408
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:15.230
Everything is peaceful in our lives. This is way better.

409
00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.710
It's, it's the truth that was sung by the angels on the night Jesus was born.

410
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.230
Remember we sing this at Christmas all the time.

411
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.830
Glory to God in the highest and on earth,

412
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.990
peace among those with whom he's pleased.

413
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.870
It's what Jesus preached in Ephesians two. Paul says it to those far off,

414
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.030
those near, it's a peace that Romans five,

415
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.590
one describes that since we've been justified by faith,

416
00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.770
we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. It's peace.

417
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:48.650
And first Colossians says it's vertical with God, yes, but it's also

418
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.210
plays out reconciliation with one another.

419
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.930
Peace with God and peace with others. As we walk in that faith.

420
00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.330
See what we're gonna learn this letter is that there's deep theological truths

421
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.930
for this peace with God in Christ who he is, what he's done,

422
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.490
that we've been made right with God. Nothing by ourselves, all by him.

423
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:12.570
But then it shows us the practical outworking of that peace in our lives,

424
00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:18.030
in our church, our families, your workplace, your classroom

425
00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.220
peace with God shows up every day.

426
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.580
You might even think of it this way,

427
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.580
the grace he's talking about expresses the cause,

428
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.990
right? The the salvation work of God. It's the cause.

429
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.510
Peace is the result.

430
00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.790
It's the effect of of the grace,

431
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.150
grace and peace.

432
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.370
And we'll see it all over Colossians.

433
00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:55.810
So we've kind of got this, this map overview so far, but this is a,

434
00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.090
this is a little deeper piece next as we get into something a little even more

435
00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.210
critical, the question now is why did they write it?

436
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.330
And we saw who wrote it? Who, who received it?

437
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:13.140
Why did they write it to the Colossians? Well,

438
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.340
first you need to know a little bit about the city of Colossae.

439
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.820
There's gonna be a map up there. It'd be in Western Turkey today.

440
00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.380
It was near La Laodicea. You'll see that in the book.

441
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.220
And on the trade route east of Ephesus.

442
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:28.860
It was on this very long trade route that went from the port cities

443
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.820
to inner of the areas. And, and so they're,

444
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.180
they're in that middle,

445
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.500
which meant that there was a lot of Greek and a lot of Roman people that lived

446
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.340
in Colossae because of that wealth.

447
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.300
And then there was a lot of Jews who had been displaced and landed in Colossae

448
00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.640
as well. And so Colossae was a spiritual melting pot.

449
00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.680
A lot of different influences all coming together.

450
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:58.480
And that religious fondue was why Paul wrote this letter to the Colossians,

451
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.370
right? He wrote this because there was a lot of cults,

452
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:07.810
a lot of false religions already there. And now the gospel had come as well.

453
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:16.130
So what was happening in Colossae was what a, what we call syncretism.

454
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.450
Like sinking together where you're mixing and matching a lot of different

455
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:26.170
religious practices and beliefs all together into something that you call new

456
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.010
from different systems. And even the Jews in Colossae were doing this.

457
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.130
They weren't purely Jew,

458
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.490
they were thrown in all kinds of stuff from other people and making a new

459
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:36.730
religion in some sense.

460
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.220
And so we think that this church in Colossae was fairly young at the time

461
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.500
that Paul was writing this. They were new believers,

462
00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:51.500
immature believers who could be easily swayed by all of those religious

463
00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:56.540
beliefs around them that they could suck into those things just as much as

464
00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.373
anybody else.

465
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.510
And so Paul wrote Colossians to address the assaults they were receiving.

466
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.910
But again, he's not responding to just something standard.

467
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.990
He can't just send them a book on Jewish thought.

468
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.830
He can't just send them a book on this specific thing.

469
00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.070
People were blending all this stuff together.

470
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.990
Even gnosticism was there where people would say, no,

471
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.110
the body doesn't matter as long as you're connected spiritually with God.

472
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.310
And what that would lead to is people could do whatever they wanted with their

473
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.750
bodies because they believe spiritually.

474
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:35.950
That's the context Paul goes into to defend the

475
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:40.330
true gospel. Guys, this is, this is the true gospel.

476
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.570
That's where we get our title here. Christ Above All.

477
00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.130
'cause he's wanting to remind them this is who Christ is.

478
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.690
This is what Christ has done.

479
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.490
Don't forget it that there's no competitors to his throne.

480
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.370
There's no other religion that works. He's the head of all things.

481
00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.290
He is the fullness of God in him, his life.

482
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:02.010
Throughout the book you'll see things like in Christ with Christ.

483
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.770
For him through him,

484
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.210
it's is Paul always going back to Jesus as everything.

485
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.820
But, but notice this.

486
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.100
Paul was not merely a systematic theologian here.

487
00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:23.040
He was also a practical theologian where he's writing to emphasize the

488
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.000
things that, that those truths should mean for daily life, for worship.

489
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:31.570
'cause he's he,

490
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.930
he's talking about the gospel as the only thing needed for salvation.

491
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.330
You don't need anything else.

492
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.750
He's talking about religious practices commanded by God.

493
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.550
You don't need to add all this other stuff. There's freedom in Christ.

494
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.150
Stop getting trapped by all these other things.

495
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:52.150
So the truth of Christ above all actually plays out in life and in worship.

496
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.200
'cause for Paul, the essence of religion is Jesus.

497
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.640
And the source of true Christian morality is Jesus above all in your life

498
00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.650
where you've died to the old self and you've raised to the new self,

499
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:14.530
that's the true source of being a new person.

500
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.370
That's why he wrote it to the Colossians.

501
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.580
But then we need to ask the question,

502
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:29.420
this final step of the map study going beyond the

503
00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.570
academic, then, okay, why do we even read it?

504
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.990
Why did he write it to them? Yeah, that's important. We need to know,

505
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:40.470
but But why do we read it? Why? Why is it important for us?

506
00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.750
What will we get out of this letter?

507
00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:47.390
What is God going to say to us through Colossians?

508
00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:53.910
Because we have a very different context than 2000 years ago in the Middle East,

509
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.650
right? Actually though,

510
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.193
when you think about it,

511
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.640
our context might not be that different than Colossae.

512
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.100
People are still making up their own truth on the fly.

513
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.540
Whatever feels good at the time

514
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.230
is that not a form of what was happening in Colossae.

515
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:29.550
We still see a lack of biblical knowledge permeating even our churches where

516
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:33.990
beliefs that have been held for 2000 years are suddenly

517
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:36.510
questioned because one guy wrote a blog about it.

518
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:45.560
We still see spiritual arrogance in some people where they are more interested

519
00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:46.780
in,

520
00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:51.400
in disqualifying others from chasing that prize than

521
00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.880
pursuing that prize themselves.

522
00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.260
We currently have a large group of Americans blending Christianity

523
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.940
with nationalistic tendencies,

524
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.060
not realizing that that actually neuter the gospel.

525
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:19.330
We still see some people more interested in following some

526
00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:24.690
externally created code of behavior than nurturing a holy

527
00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.773
heart.

528
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:34.770
We still see so-called Christians living no differently than the world

529
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:39.170
around us who are thinking they're safe because they prayed a prayer when they

530
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:43.040
were young. See, listen,

531
00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.400
we might be really far distance and time away from colossae,

532
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.840
but the human heart is still the same.

533
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:56.080
Like we still search after me being a part of a group.

534
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:58.840
Even if that means we have to compromise to be a part of that group,

535
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.510
our heart still drifts towards sin.

536
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.620
Our heart still wants all the things

537
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:16.340
that that a flesh is seeking after to be assured of its own

538
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.420
salvation by its own effort. That's what our heart is naturally doing.

539
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.300
And on and on and on, we could see we are no different than Colossians.

540
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:29.490
That's why we need the letter too. That's why we need this letter too.

541
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.610
'cause we're reading and studying Colossians,

542
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.050
not because we just want increases of our intellectual knowledge.

543
00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:40.290
What we read this for is because we want increases in our christological

544
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.810
knowledge that we need to know more about who he is and want more

545
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.810
of who he is, that he is Christ above all.

546
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:52.250
'cause Paul lands there over and over and over in this book,

547
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:57.410
that Jesus cannot be one mere element of some

548
00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.450
religion that you've made up in your mind.

549
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:07.110
That he cannot just be one of many influencers in your life.

550
00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:15.170
No, because he's the source of all life.

551
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:19.370
He is the giver of life. He's the sustainer of life.

552
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.170
He's the giver of new life.

553
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:25.650
And that means he should be the center and circumference of all of our lives.

554
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:29.850
Why? Because he's the Lord overall. He already is that.

555
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:35.440
And so we in our lives must acknowledge that and come to him in that because he

556
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.920
is Lord over everything spiritual. He's Lord over everything material.

557
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:43.000
He's Lord over everything external. He's the Lord over everything internal.

558
00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.400
He cannot just be a part of your life.

559
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.200
And so we need the Holy Spirit to awaken our hearts,

560
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.800
to see this glorious Jesus,

561
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.900
to see who he is, to see what he's done,

562
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:07.130
so that then we can give every moment of our lives to him that he is

563
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.810
worthy of it all. Listen,

564
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.970
I need to see him as strong enough to handle my sin,

565
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.610
my past, my shame.

566
00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.700
But I also need to see him as strong enough to handle my future,

567
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.640
my temptations, my decisions,

568
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.260
my joy is He enough.

569
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.380
So listen, your salvation does not start when you die and go to heaven.

570
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.950
Colossians will show us that you can actually participate with him in

571
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:52.430
the power and joy of your salvation even today.

572
00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:00.710
That's, that's what I hope you see through this study of Colossians,

573
00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:06.830
through the amazing grace and the reconciling peace that he

574
00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.670
gives us that you would see and I would see,

575
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:13.110
and we would really believe that Christ is above all.
