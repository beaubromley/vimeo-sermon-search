1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
Who is the god

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.100
like Yahweh the god

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.300
of wrath the god of Mercy The God

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.700
Who reaches down to unworthy people.

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.400
Well, happy Sunday church. My name is John. If

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.600
I haven't met you yet. Please come meet me. I'd love to meet you and I see

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.400
as a privilege and a blessing to get to preach

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.000
most every week as one way to serve the church this

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.700
fall. We are walking through the Old Testament prophet Micah

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.600
that his book is called

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.300
Micah and so you go and find that if you haven't yet,

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.300
but we are gonna be in the first few verses of chapter

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.100
4 of my cuff Micah for

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.700
first five verses as we get into it today though. I want

15
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.200
to tell you about something I read about last week an angle

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.600
can Bishop in Mozambique. His name

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000
is Dennis singulane.

18
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
And he was at the Forefront of bringing their Civil War to an

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.700
end back in 1992.

20
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.800
Now at the end of the war the UN was supposed to disarm both

21
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.500
sides.

22
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.900
But most of the weapons actually remained hidden.

23
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
Because people were afraid the conflict was start again, or they

24
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.500
were afraid of prosecution if they gave their weapons over

25
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.000
so it most in the remained hidden. So what Dennis

26
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.100
and the Christian counsel of

27
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
Mozambique what they did to resolve this continuing

28
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.500
tension.

29
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.000
Was they initiated What's called the transforming arms

30
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.700
into tools project?

31
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.600
This program advocated the return of weapons which

32
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.500
are tools of death, right?

33
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.300
Advocated return of weapons in exchange for sewing machines

34
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.200
and garden implements and bikes

35
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.800
and construction materials.

36
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.100
Tools of life, right?

37
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
And one example of Village turned over all of their weapons in

38
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.900
exchange for a tractor so they could Farm more easily.

39
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.700
In fact, nearly one million weapons were

40
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.200
exchanged in the first 10 years of this program.

41
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.100
You're asking the question what happens to the weapons though?

42
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.300
Well, they are cut up and the pieces are handed

43
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.500
over to a group of artists.

44
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.900
Who turn them into sculptures and bed frames

45
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.500
and chairs and tables and all kinds

46
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.000
of different things.

47
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.100
In fact a tree of life made out of

48
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.400
ak-47's pistols and rocket propelled grenade launchers

49
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.700
became the new symbol of peace.

50
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.600
Pretty amazing, right like this is what happened in

51
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.500
Mozambique. But here's what we're going to see today in Micah

52
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.600
4.

53
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.800
That's what the kingdom of God does.

54
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500
The kingdom of God brings a great reversal.

55
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.200
We're going to see that very clearly today that the kingdom of

56
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.000
God brings a great reversal in so

57
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.900
many ways in our lives and Society.

58
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.700
It's been said that God is a god of a world upside down.

59
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.300
He just basically as a god of surprises a god

60
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.300
of the unexpected. He flips things on its head. He does things

61
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.700
the way the world doesn't it's completely different.

62
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.800
It's a great reversal.

63
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.600
Because remember where we've come so far in Micah.

64
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.500
As God's people turned their backs on God

65
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.300
and His Covenant. He was judging them

66
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.800
by allowing destruction to come from outside forces.

67
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.100
And the reason was because the people and even the leaders of the

68
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.400
people were idolatrous. They were greedy. They were oppressing

69
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.000
the poor.

70
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.500
And worst of all they didn't believe God's true character.

71
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.400
which led then of course as we saw last week to the

72
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.900
end of chapter 3 verse 12

73
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.000
all of that led to

74
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.100
therefore Because of You Zion that Hill

75
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.400
shall be plowed as a field.

76
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.200
Jerusalem that City on that Hill shall become

77
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.700
a heap of ruins

78
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.100
And the mountain of the house house of the Lord a

79
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.300
wooded height as if it didn't even exist.

80
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.500
And it seems tragic.

81
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.500
Seems like all hope is lost. This is the end. This is

82
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.400
certainly how things are going to go, right?

83
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.800
but

84
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.700
not all hope is lost.

85
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.300
Because what Micah does next is he inserts a

86
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.800
reversal?

87
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.400
He gives this vision of the future.

88
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.000
That was intended to cause God's faithful Remnant

89
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.300
to Stand Fast and what they were facing.

90
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.300
That God has said this is what's

91
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.800
coming. The threat of of judgment is coming.

92
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.200
But if you believe in him if you still hold on to him

93
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.900
then stand fast because this is

94
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.300
coming.

95
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.400
For them back, then this would have been encouragement help and hope

96
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.600
right?

97
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.300
But I think we'll see even for us today that there is a hope that

98
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.400
we should have to be able to stand fast whenever we Face

99
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.300
trials as well.

100
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.100
So we're going to look first at these reversals In

101
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.200
this passage. I'm going to see five of

102
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.200
them.

103
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.600
I'm going to read through Chapter 4 verses 1 through 5 to see

104
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.600
where we're going. But again remember this is

105
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.100
immediately after verse 12 of chapter 3

106
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.200
where he said this is all going to be destroyed.

107
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.500
Verse 1 of chapter 4. He says it

108
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.300
shall come to pass in the latter days that

109
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.200
the mountain the mountain you just talked about being destroyed the

110
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.400
mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of

111
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.900
the mountains.

112
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.800
It should be lifted up above the hills and peoples shall

113
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.700
flow to it.

114
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.400
And many nations shall come and say come

115
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.300
let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the god

116
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.300
of Jacob that he may teach us his ways that we

117
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.100
may walk in his paths.

118
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.100
For out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the

119
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.400
Lord from Jerusalem.

120
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.100
He shall judge between many people's so decide disputes

121
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.700
for strong Nations far away.

122
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.700
And they shall beat their swords into plowshares and

123
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.300
their Spears into pruning hooks. Those

124
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.300
are garden tools.

125
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.300
Nation shall not lift up sword against Nation neither

126
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.300
shall they even learn War anymore, but they shall sit

127
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.700
every man under his Vine and under his fig tree and no

128
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.000
one shall make them afraid.

129
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.000
For the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.

130
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.900
For all the people's walk each in the name of its God, but

131
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.100
we will walk in the name of the Lord

132
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.200
Our God forever and ever.

133
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.200
Now before we dig into this past you need to clarify what he's even talking about here.

134
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.400
Because remember Micah was talking to a specific group

135
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.700
of people about 2,700 years ago who were

136
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.700
facing specific threats and needed specific. Hope

137
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.700
it's a whole book, right? It's all too someone

138
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.200
there. So for them as their hearing

139
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.400
this this surely in verse one the latter days that surely was

140
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.100
future, right it was long from now. We

141
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.300
know this is coming.

142
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.300
Anytime by the way, the prophets use that term latter days or

143
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.100
that day. It's referring to this kind of

144
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.900
indefinite time future that surrounded

145
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.300
the Lord's return the Messiah coming

146
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.600
and this this Kingdom and so they they saw that as that day

147
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.700
out there.

148
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.400
And so they had this perspective that this is surely future. But

149
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.800
we now know as we read through further in

150
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.600
God's word. We progressively get more information

151
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.300
about what was predicted here and in

152
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.100
all the other prophets.

153
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.300
And so what they're talking about is yes a location because it

154
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.200
has to happen somewhere has to start somewhere. So talking about

155
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.300
this location of a mountain and Jerusalem and those kind of things but

156
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.600
as they talked about it, they were more Kingdom focused

157
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.300
than they were location-focused.

158
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.900
Again, it matters but but they focus primarily on the

159
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.400
spiritual implications of that Kingdom that

160
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:23.800
was coming.

161
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.600
Like they're talking future as if it's gonna happen someday, but

162
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.200
here's what's going to happen whenever it does.

163
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.100
That's their priority here.

164
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.000
And so they talk about in such a way that we can glean the

165
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.100
spiritual insights from and of what's coming

166
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.200
for us as well. But we also then need to lay

167
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.500
on top of it something we call the already but

168
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.500
not yet nature of God's Kingdom.

169
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.500
So for them, it was pretty much all future right, but but

170
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.600
we think now we can look and see elements of

171
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.400
this have already happened in some ways. They're

172
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.400
already some truth to these pieces and you look at the rest of the prophets.

173
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.800
You can see already. Some of it has come but

174
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.700
not all of it yet.

175
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.800
That there's still a future element to

176
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.300
this Kingdom that's described here,

177
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:14.400
right?

178
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.200
So it's a little bit of confusion that we walk through this. What is

179
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.000
the kingdom of God? Who is it now or is it future? Well, yes.

180
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.600
Both now and already not yet.

181
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.200
So I'll explain more kind of how that plays out as we

182
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.500
go through this a little bit, but that's just so you get a an overview of

183
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.400
of really this prophecy and how we handle

184
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.400
that going forward.

185
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.100
But first again, we're going to look at the reversals. We see here as

186
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.000
we look at this Kingdom that is coming that is

187
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.600
already here in some ways. How does this reverse

188
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.500
things in the world? Look at it in Micah

189
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:49.900
4 first

190
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.900
Reversal is that the mountain that was once destroyed in

191
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.400
the kingdom is now restored.

192
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.300
The mountain that was once destroyed we see here

193
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.100
is now going to be restored that's talking about

194
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.900
Mount Zion that we just referenced at the end of chapter 3 Jerusalem's

195
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.200
Hill.

196
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.700
Right, that's where all of that the centerpiece

197
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.000
of history for Israel

198
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.200
was that but now after it had been

199
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.000
destroyed is prophesied to be destroyed and we see

200
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.100
later in history that it was.

201
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.200
At some point Micah says that it would go back to being the most

202
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.300
important Hill the highest over all

203
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.300
of the others.

204
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.400
It would regain prominence, but then there's also this idea

205
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.300
of the mountain was the place where God physically dwelled in his Temple

206
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.500
there on that mountain his people would come to worship him

207
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.500
from all over to come to Jerusalem. That

208
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.200
was where it was and now it's destroyed.

209
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.300
He removed his presence due to their sin do

210
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.100
their false worship. He said no, I I'm not dwelling there anymore.

211
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.400
But here now we see he would restore

212
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.500
that Worship On The Mountain again.

213
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.200
His perfect pattern according to the temple in heaven, he

214
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.400
would restore it here in this location. And so

215
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.500
when we we read that and we understand we say

216
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.100
clearly that hasn't happened yet, right?

217
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.800
So we even us are looking forward to something

218
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.800
like they were.

219
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.100
Here's what we're looking forward to.

220
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.300
To something that the New Testament calls the New

221
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.300
Jerusalem on this mountain.

222
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.200
Which will again be the most important city the

223
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.500
most important mountain in all of creation. That's what

224
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.500
he is restoring again. It's it's something

225
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.200
that Micah's faithful Remnant would have

226
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.600
needed to hear in the moment the hope that that brings right

227
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.300
that there's they're pressing in all of the destruction was

228
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.700
coming. They're like is this mountain is this hill gonna be destroyed like

229
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.000
God promises it might but

230
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.800
hope coming.

231
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.300
This is all going to be restored one day.

232
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.400
So hang on.

233
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.400
So that's the first reversal is that this destroyed mountain

234
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.000
now is restored second.

235
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.200
Similarly that Temple that was

236
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.500
on that mountain and will be again was that was once local

237
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.900
now, it will be Global in

238
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.700
the kingdom of God.

239
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.100
The temple that was once local now global.

240
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.400
Notice at the end of verse 1 it says people's shall flow

241
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.000
to it.

242
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.400
This also gets to an illustration right guys does

243
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.100
does water flow uphill?

244
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.600
No, so the image is like the streams flowing

245
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.300
uphill.

246
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.300
The streams of water the streams of people, but that's the

247
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.200
the reversal ideas that streams will flow up

248
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.200
to the mountain people verse 2

249
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.600
says many nations shall come.

250
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.500
To God's house. It says the house of the Lord to

251
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.300
learn and Obey what God says about himself and about

252
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.700
how to live that's what the streams are going towards because

253
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.400
remember this.

254
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.700
The temple was local before.

255
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.300
Like the Jews even Judah itself

256
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.300
saw it kind of like an exclusive club that we've got the temple here.

257
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.400
We've got the location the presence of God lives here and

258
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.600
we're gonna hinder people from fully worshiping Gentiles.

259
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.500
You stay out there. We're gonna come in here. We can come to God,

260
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.900
but nobody else really can in that sense, but

261
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:26.100
now

262
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.700
in the kingdom of God as the kingdom comes

263
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.500
versus one and two actually use some words in the

264
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:35.800
Hebrew language.

265
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.700
For people and Nations. It's it's

266
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.900
not talking about geopolitical countries

267
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.800
with a border.

268
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.700
Those words mean it's talking about families. It's

269
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.500
talking about ethnicities what we say are

270
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.400
people groups.

271
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.900
Distinct cultures and languages and and demographics

272
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.400
that that are are very different from

273
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.500
somebody who even lives 10 miles away from them. That's a people

274
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.300
group a family a clan you might say and so

275
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.200
when it says all of these nations are flowing to

276
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.300
this new city, it means this is a global

277
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.100
Temple now,

278
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.600
Not just local. It's got a global

279
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.300
idea. It's the same thing that John in Revelation.

280
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.800
He looked into heaven God gave

281
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.300
him this vision of what this Kingdom will

282
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.600
look like in the end. It's Revelation 7:9 and 10. He

283
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.300
says Behold a great multitude that no one

284
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.100
could number from every nation. That's that word

285
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.700
again from all tribes and peoples and languages standing Before

286
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.300
the Throne before the lamb clothed in white robes with

287
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.400
palm branches in their hands. They're worshiping him crying

288
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.600
out with a loud voice salvation Belongs To Our God

289
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.100
who sits on the throne and to the lamb

290
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.300
They're worshiping Jesus.

291
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.400
This is a global temple in the kingdom of

292
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:57.600
God.

293
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.900
Here's another reversal number three.

294
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.200
This Micah four Kingdom shows us

295
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.500
that laws once shunned now

296
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.800
desired.

297
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.300
The laws that once were shunned turned away

298
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.100
kicked to the side now are desired.

299
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.800
Again, all these people are flowing Upstream

300
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.200
to come to the temple to do what?

301
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.100
They're coming to hear it says.

302
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.800
Right verse 2 that he may teach us his ways and

303
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.400
that we may walk in his past for out of Zion shall

304
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.500
go forth. The law the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. They're coming

305
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.500
to hear the word of God.

306
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.500
And remember these are these foreign Nations who were

307
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.300
once opposed to anything Yahweh.

308
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.200
Right. In fact, they they mocked the true worship of Yahweh. They

309
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.000
had their own ways of living. They had their own ways of of worshiping.

310
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.200
They thought it was silly. Like why would you ever follow like don't you want

311
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.700
to eat bacon? I mean, come on, like why would you ever want to follow this guy? He's

312
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.500
telling you these things and they're saying all of

313
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.400
this until this point when the kingdom comes

314
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.300
and now it flips and all the sudden they want to hear.

315
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.800
And not just they want to hear they want to obey what God

316
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.400
has said about himself and how life works.

317
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.300
That's foreigners coming for that but even God's Own

318
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:31.500
people.

319
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.100
Because we've got a pretty negative picture of God's people so far

320
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.900
in Micah, right?

321
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.300
They've turned their backs on his Covenant laws and

322
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.600
his Commandments and they said no, I'm gonna do it my own way now instead

323
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.400
of that in the kingdom of God when the kingdom fully comes.

324
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.700
We see Ezekiel 36 verses 25

325
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.400
through 27 come to pass where God says,

326
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.400
I'll sprinkle clean water on you I will make you

327
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.300
clean from all your uncleannesses from all your Idols. I

328
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.200
will cleanse you I will give you a new heart and a

329
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.200
new spirit. I'll put within you. I'll remove Your Heart of Stone from

330
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.500
your flesh give you a heart of Flesh.

331
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.500
And I will put my spirit within you.

332
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.900
And cause you to walk in my statutes

333
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.300
and be careful to obey my rules.

334
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.000
That's what happens when the kingdom of God Reigns

335
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.600
in someone's life.

336
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.300
Not only foreigners seeing the value of

337
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:29.900
God's word.

338
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.300
But his formerly rebellious people.

339
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.300
The ones who have their whole lives turn their backs

340
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.300
on him will begin to align more with

341
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.800
What God Says is, right?

342
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.100
So what happens when the kingdom of God comes it's a great reversal?

343
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.500
the fourth one here

344
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.400
And this one shows what God's word does in the life and in

345
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.200
a society?

346
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.700
The fourth Kingdom reversal is the wars that were once raging

347
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.700
now are absent.

348
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.200
Those Wars that were raging at the

349
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.000
time that for a history in the

350
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:13.600
kingdom of God.

351
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.700
Fully Are Not absent are absent.

352
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.100
And we see it again in Micah 4 look at verses 3 and 4.

353
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.400
He shall judge between many people shall decide disputes for

354
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.400
strong Nations far away. They shall beat their swords into

355
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.200
plowshares. And there's Spears into

356
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.300
pruning hooks. Again. That's the garden implements Nation shall not

357
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.600
lift up sword against Nation. Neither. Shall they learn War anymore, but

358
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.100
they shall sit every man under his Vine under his fig tree

359
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.400
and no one shall make them afraid for the mouth of the Lord of host has

360
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.000
spoken.

361
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.400
So remember who Micah's talking to right now in this setting he's

362
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.200
saying these things most likely to

363
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.300
the remnant left with King Hezekiah as the

364
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.600
Assyrians were closing in on Jerusalem.

365
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.300
They'd already taken a lot of the land around them. And now

366
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.200
they're all holed up in Jerusalem. The Assyrians are right

367
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.500
on the outside and they're ready to destroy that City, too.

368
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800
and so these people

369
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.000
Micah's audience could hear the Spears

370
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.500
and the swords clanging around outside

371
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.500
the wall. Just ready to come overtake them

372
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.300
like they're gonna they're gonna lead to death and

373
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.300
sorrow and pain where is any hope like is it

374
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.200
always gonna be this way?

375
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.300
You know, they're sitting there thinking God is this is this what the

376
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.900
end is for us? Is this how it's gonna be?

377
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.800
Well Micah speaks for God and says no.

378
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.900
This is not how it will always be.

379
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.500
There's coming a day when things will be different. All the conflict will now

380
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.800
be gone in the kingdom of God because everything's going to be decided rightly.

381
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.200
According to God's word. Everybody's gonna be living according to God's

382
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.700
word. There will be no more conflict. In fact, all of the

383
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.500
the war games like you won't have to go to West Point anymore

384
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.300
to learn more because there's not even more

385
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.100
It's all gone. And in fact, like we saw in

386
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.400
Mozambique all the weapons will be turned into garden tools. Imagine

387
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.300
raking with like a grenade launcher or

388
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.800
something. Like that's what it's gonna happen.

389
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.200
Okay, so

390
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.500
So what will people do?

391
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.400
If we can't debate on Facebook anymore, if

392
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.000
we can't create Wars like what are people going to do all day?

393
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.100
Well, it says it right here.

394
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.200
Gonna sit under their Vines and fig trees.

395
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.600
Which we're like what what does that even mean? Okay. Well, it's an illustration for for

396
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.700
peace and prosperity.

397
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.100
Where it means like there's no threat.

398
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.500
If you got no problems, no issues. No one worried that

399
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.900
somebody's going to come take there's nothing threatening around.

400
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.700
I came I had this image as I was reading that last

401
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.600
week like you you imagine them.

402
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.400
What he's talking about here you imagine them spreading

403
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.300
out like a picnic blanket under this tree and they

404
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.300
got some peanut butter and fig jelly sandwiches and

405
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.200
they're got a nice little glass of grape juice to wash it down with and

406
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.000
they're just enjoying the Cool Breeze and hanging out having a great

407
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.200
time. Like that's the image.

408
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.900
And we're all like that's kind of funny. But no we all want that don't we?

409
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.400
We're all looking forward to fall whenever the weather turns and we can actually sit outside

410
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.300
and not sweat all day. Like that's what we want. We want this.

411
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.800
Even unbelievers want this, right?

412
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.200
In fact, this is for so Micah writes this Isaiah writes

413
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.400
a very similar passage. It's an Isaiah

414
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.900
chapter 2 that passage from Isaiah 2 is on the wall outside

415
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.800
of the United Nations.

416
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.200
This turning swords into plowshares and Spears and

417
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.300
pretty good. That's what their Desiring too.

418
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.300
So what the world is created we have this innate desire

419
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.400
in us for peace for Comfort. We know this is wrong conflict

420
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.400
and War we know it's bad like just think

421
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.500
of every Beauty whatever they call scholarship pageants now,

422
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.400
I don't know but like it's every answer to

423
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.000
the the one question. What's your greatest world world peace, right.

424
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.200
That's what I want World Peace.

425
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.000
It's in US.

426
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.000
It's it's there because we know there's something

427
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.000
better out there.

428
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.600
And we work for it. We work for it. The problem is.

429
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.300
It doesn't work, right.

430
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.100
We still fight all the time about stuff. They're still Wars going

431
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.100
on all the time. There's it's it's because the sin inside of

432
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:38.300
us.

433
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:39.800
It's there.

434
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.100
But Micah 4 says it doesn't have to be that way and one day it's not going to

435
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.000
be that way. But here's the only reason it's possible.

436
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:52.800
because in verse

437
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.400
4 he says

438
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.600
the Lord of hosts has spoken.

439
00:22:59.500 --> 00:22:59.900
see that

440
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.900
because the Lord of hosts has spoken.

441
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.800
Now that word hosts refers to the armies

442
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.200
of angels in heaven.

443
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.200
And there are Allegiance upon Legions. We don't even know how many

444
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.600
angels there are in God's Army, but he

445
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.500
fully controls them which means

446
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.400
no earthly. Army could stand a chance

447
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.100
against God's Heavenly Army.

448
00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.000
The Lord of hosts has said here's how

449
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.300
this is going to go. And so nobody stands any chance. That's why

450
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.100
there's peace.

451
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.100
When God's kingdom fully comes because God the king is

452
00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.300
fully in charge at that point.

453
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.400
Nobody has any say there's no conflict because

454
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.200
it's one way and this is how it's going to go.

455
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.700
And it's the best way because he designed it that way.

456
00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:50.600
That's coming.

457
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.500
That's coming the kingdom of God as it comes one

458
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.700
day fully will come and there's no conflict anymore.

459
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.600
No more family strife.

460
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.900
No more invasions of countries none of that.

461
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.000
It will all be resolved.

462
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.300
But we're not there yet, right.

463
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.700
so until that time comes

464
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.100
until that day

465
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.200
We know that the more God comes to

466
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.100
reign in people's lives.

467
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.200
The more life looks like this picture of

468
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.400
Peace in Micah 4.

469
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.200
Right, the more god reigns in

470
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.300
you the more peace making you will be.

471
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.800
This is coming to bear as the kingdom comes in you.

472
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.000
This should come more out of you.

473
00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.600
It's a reversal.

474
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.200
Where we once fought over everything now, peace.

475
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.300
Here's the final reversal it's in verse 5 a

476
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.300
little more hidden but it's kind of a call to action you'll see it look

477
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:01.900
at verse 5 again.

478
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.400
Says for all the people's walk each in the name of its God, but

479
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.700
we will walk in the name of the Lord Our God forever and

480
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.000
ever.

481
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.400
So here's the reversal as I see it here.

482
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.400
people that were once oppressed

483
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.300
now Victorious

484
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.800
the people that were once oppressed

485
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.000
now Victorious

486
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.400
because again remember the context of Micah 4

487
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.700
People all around them.

488
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.600
Were submitting to their own little G

489
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.100
Gods gods that are not really Gods right? They were finding all

490
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.500
these different Idols to worship. All these different gods to follow all

491
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.500
of them were submitting to their own Gods and

492
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.300
not only that they were mocking Judah as

493
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.300
they worshiped the one true God and so

494
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.500
Micah ends in verse 5 by saying

495
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.500
their gods aren't actually going to last.

496
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.400
You see that?

497
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.300
They walk in these but we walk in the name of our God

498
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.200
forever and ever they walk temporarily it might work

499
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.500
for a little while, but forever and ever our

500
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.100
god reigns. We as God's people

501
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.800
will walk in the name of Yahweh Our God forever and

502
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.100
ever.

503
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.500
That's what he means here.

504
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.300
He's saying to us. This is what he's saying to them saying to us.

505
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.300
This is what you need to see is that there's one true God

506
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.100
and he is Yahweh.

507
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.500
And so for those in that moment who were once oppressed by

508
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.200
all the unbelievers around them now they look

509
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.200
at this and they're shown to be victorious over all the

510
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.000
other false religion.

511
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.200
That they know they're about to be attacked. They're about to be overtaken, but

512
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.400
they know one day they're on the right side of history in

513
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:56.700
this thing.

514
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.000
You always God. He's the one we're going to cling to him. No matter

515
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.200
what a truth which should lead them and lead us to

516
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.300
remain faithful instead fast every day.

517
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.400
Because he is God.

518
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.800
And he's Victorious.

519
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.100
So you see these reversals, right? So the kingdom of

520
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.300
God does as kingdom comes in our lives comes in society. It comes

521
00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.100
once and for all someday it brings a great reversal and

522
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.000
how the world Works how the how the Lord cares for

523
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.300
his people how he desires worship to occur. This is what he does

524
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.600
as he brings his kingdom.

525
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.300
So the question is what do we do with this?

526
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.200
What do we do with this passage? Again? Michael was speaking to them,

527
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.300
but he said since speaking to us. What do we do? How does it apply to

528
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.400
us both now and in the future, how do we do what we

529
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.000
need to do with this? We saw what it meant for them.

530
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.900
We see glimpses of what it's going to mean for us someday.

531
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.100
What about today? How do we apply it?

532
00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.200
How we encouraged by it how we challenge by this?

533
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.100
What are some simple ways we can step forward in this?

534
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.300
Well first here's the

535
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.100
The thing we know for certain in response to

536
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:12.300
this.

537
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.500
Is like Micah called them to do we must also look to

538
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.200
the king.

539
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.000
first and foremost

540
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.100
we must look to the king.

541
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.100
She really clear throughout this passage is the reality that

542
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.900
there is a king and his name is Yahweh.

543
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.200
There's no other option.

544
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.300
And and no other God as it says in verse 5

545
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.700
know that God can sustain. No the God can last no

546
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.200
other God will prove worthy. This is him and

547
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.700
him alone and he's gonna restore all things to his way.

548
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.800
And what's going to happen someday is

549
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.000
that all human kind will respond one way

550
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.700
or the other when God shows himself

551
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.400
as the king.

552
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.700
It's best to go ahead and acknowledge Him as king now.

553
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.200
Let me just give you a warning for that don't want to wait till

554
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.300
that day. And then decide you need to acknowledge Him as King

555
00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.500
in your life today.

556
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.100
Because this Lord of hosts.

557
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.500
is the one who brings peace in our lives he

558
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.600
is our peace scripture says

559
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.500
And the way he brings peace.

560
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.300
Which the the number one need for

561
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:37.300
peace we have is in his relationship with

562
00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.500
him. That's peace. Number one. The only way he brings peace

563
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.300
in that way is ultimately through the life death and resurrection

564
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.200
of Jesus in our place.

565
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.000
And so it counts vertically first.

566
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.700
Things that that Micah's audience would have only known a

567
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.700
hint of we now know the greatest need

568
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.500
we have like they couldn't walk up the hill themselves right who

569
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.300
can Ascend who separated from us, they couldn't make

570
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.100
it and so they knew they needed something. We now know who

571
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.500
that is that something that someone is Jesus

572
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.100
God In the Flesh who lived the perfect life we could never

573
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.100
live died to death. We deserve and defeated sin and death

574
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.700
once and for all in his resurrection. That is

575
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.300
the way we have peace with God.

576
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.300
The only way you can be a part of this delivered City

577
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:25.700
someday.

578
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.200
Like if you want this Micah for picture in your

579
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.100
life you turn from your sin turn from yourself turn to Jesus.

580
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.600
You confess with your mouth that Jesus is your king and you

581
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.200
believe in your heart that God did raise him from the dead and

582
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.300
you will be saved you'll be included in this

583
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.000
city forever.

584
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.400
But listen, that's

585
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.600
I know there's a lot of effort given in the world towards self-help and

586
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.600
correction and trying to be better at a person and okay great.

587
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.200
But that is when the

588
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.600
Great reverse will begins in your life.

589
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.400
See what happens then is you say God, you're my

590
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.700
king and his kingdom starts to reign in your life.

591
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.400
His kingship is in charge of your heart

592
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.300
as you Shuffle down off the Throne of your heart and let

593
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.600
him sit rightly in his place on that Throne. That's when

594
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.100
the reversal happens in your life.

595
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.400
things begin to change so you start by looking to

596
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.600
the king not just by glancing up at him and knowing he's there but by

597
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.700
looking to him in faith and trust

598
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.900
That's what we're talking about.

599
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:34.900
Because when you do that.

600
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.700
As you look more fully to the king you will

601
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.300
naturally then live for the king.

602
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.400
You look to the king.

603
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.500
You will then begin to live for the king.

604
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.000
That's one of the main themes this passage.

605
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.800
It's the word walk or the word come. It's the same word in

606
00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.400
the original language used a little bit differently.

607
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.500
Walk walk come come which which illustrates how

608
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.400
important one's lifestyle is here, right?

609
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.600
Because these people want to walk in his paths that

610
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.500
means live not just walk a certain Road. It's

611
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.300
to live in a certain way verse 5 even

612
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.300
says that there are multiple options.

613
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.700
of who you walk in the name of

614
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.200
You see that right? He says you you represent something

615
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.300
someone as you live your

616
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:29.500
life.

617
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.600
Kind of we're in football season now, so kind of thinking like you're wearing

618
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.000
someone's Jersey as you live your life.

619
00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.200
So you have one option which is to wear the jersey of any

620
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.300
other false god or idle or

621
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.400
thing. You're living for that that you live your life having their

622
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.500
logo on your chest.

623
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.400
That you are representing them you are living for the

624
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.900
name of this entity.

625
00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.000
That's one option.

626
00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.600
The other and better and Lasting option

627
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.500
is to where yahweh's Jersey?

628
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.500
To walk in the name of Yahweh having his

629
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.400
logo on your chest in Revelation says on your forehead, right?

630
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.700
It's gonna be there where you represent him to

631
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.000
the world as you live your life.

632
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.000
And again, we're not just talking about after Jesus returns and

633
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.700
the kingdoms fully inaugurated. We're talking about putting that Jersey on now and

634
00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.200
wearing it and representing him even today as the

635
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.300
kingdom reorients our hearts and lives towards him and

636
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.000
his ways.

637
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.300
Because remember this the kingdom of God the way we

638
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.200
live in the Kingdom will often look upside down to

639
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.000
the world around us.

640
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.300
That's the whole point of why we studied The Parables this

641
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:48.500
summer.

642
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.200
Because they're about the kingdom and their their whole

643
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.100
point is to show us that the kingdom of God works completely

644
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.900
backwards to the way the world sometimes.

645
00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.200
often

646
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.100
and so he's saying to us as Jesus told the Parables he's saying reorient your

647
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.900
life reset your life around the kingdom principles

648
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.200
that I have because it's gonna look different than the way of

649
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.800
the world and the way your heart and flesh really want to go in sense.

650
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.200
Now, you've got to you've got to think differently. You got

651
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.600
a reverse this thing to live for the kingdom of

652
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:20.900
God.

653
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.900
I read it this way this week our lifestyles.

654
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.500
Are meant to be a sign of the

655
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.400
future in the present.

656
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.200
The kingdom coming in our lives

657
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.300
today is meant to show what the Kingdom looks like fully one

658
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:42.500
day.

659
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.500
To reflect it to show it to the logo of

660
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.500
the Kingdom on our chest to say here's what it looks like.

661
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.000
Here's the way you can trust. It looks.

662
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.400
So there's a lifestyle difference. Here's another part of applying

663
00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:57.800
this today.

664
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.500
We saw here that the Nations will one

665
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.500
day desire to hear God's word, right? They're going

666
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.300
to stream to this new Temple. So why don't

667
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.200
we go ahead and get a jump start on this thing and start carrying God's word

668
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:11.900
to people today.

669
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.100
Locally here your neighbors your coworkers fellow students.

670
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.400
You you carry the word of God to them globally to

671
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.300
people who don't have a chance to hear. We carry God's word to them that's

672
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.600
gonna happen in the Kingdom. So let's start doing it now.

673
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.400
Another thing we see here. If one day that they're

674
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.000
in the Kingdom fully coming. If one day there's going to

675
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.200
be peace on Earth Goodwill toward men Merry Christmas,

676
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.400
right if that's going to come someday.

677
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.900
Then we should seek to bring about that peace that Shalom

678
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.800
the Old Testament says even today.

679
00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.900
Be peacemakers even today to live Fair lives

680
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.500
with people.

681
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.100
This is Kingdom stuff to seek Justice by lining everything with

682
00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.400
God's Right Way in his word to stop coveting to

683
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.300
avoid strife and bitterness to take no revenge over

684
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.300
people to only speak words that build up not tear down.

685
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.300
This is being a peacemaker that Jesus said in Matthew

686
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.600
5:9 blessed are the peacemakers.

687
00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.400
For they shall be called sons of God.

688
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.600
Logo on your chest designated as something based

689
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.800
on your peacemaking.

690
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.500
It's a lifestyle shift to bring about the kingdom of God into day-to-day

691
00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.200
life. This is living for the king.

692
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.300
See we often talk about in church like the future hope

693
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.500
that we have an absolutely we do that one day when God's

694
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.200
kingdom fully comes. It's all gonna be perfect again like

695
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.200
the Garden of Eden was

696
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.900
Where there's no more dementia, there's no more Strife. There's

697
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.700
no more cancer and none of that's even existing

698
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.900
anymore. It's going to be one day.

699
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.800
absolutely, we hold on to that but

700
00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.400
you and I as Believers have a

701
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.900
foretaste of that Kingdom in us already.

702
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.300
Kingdom God's Reign and Rule one day

703
00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.300
fully right now in your life

704
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.700
Through you in you working out

705
00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.500
his Rule and Reign. So we should

706
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.400
then work out those principles Even

707
00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.700
in our daily lives today.

708
00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.000
It's what Jesus prayed to his father in Matthew 6:10. He

709
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.600
says your kingdom come your will

710
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.800
be done on Earth as it already is in heaven.

711
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.800
He basically prayed God let us help us

712
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.500
live out your kingdom as a perfectly

713
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.300
is up there and one day will be let us

714
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.200
live it out here today.

715
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.600
Your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven your kingdom

716
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.700
come that's the goal.

717
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.400
Because when we talk about the future like we always do about

718
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.100
how hopeful it's going to be and we celebrate in clap. What

719
00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.300
the the No More Pain No, More Death all of that. We love that

720
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.300
and we clap for that and we wait for that but you got

721
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.400
to hear me waiting is not passive.

722
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.900
Waiting is active.

723
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.300
Like we have to think waiting. We just kind of sit on the couch and veg

724
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.700
out and hope it comes someday, you know waiting is an active principle,

725
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.200
which is how second Peter 3 describes it by the

726
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.200
way second Peter 3 verses 11 through 14. He says

727
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.400
in light of this latter days that is coming

728
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.800
in light of the Kingdom coming someday. He says since

729
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.800
all these things are to be dissolved what sort

730
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.000
of people ought you to be.

731
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.200
in lives of Holiness and godliness

732
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.100
Waiting for and hastening the coming of the

733
00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:40.400
day of God.

734
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.100
He says that day of God's the heavens going to be set on fire

735
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.700
dissolved the heavenly bodies of melt as they burn basically God's gonna hit reset on

736
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.600
entire creation. But according to his promise

737
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.200
we're waiting for new heavens and new earth in which

738
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.600
righteousness dwells.

739
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.700
Therefore check this out therefore beloved since

740
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.800
you are waiting for these things.

741
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.800
Be diligent to be found by him without spot

742
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.700
or blemish.

743
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.200
Waiting is not passive waiting is active and waiting is

744
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.400
a lifestyle difference.

745
00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:18.600
because of what's coming

746
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.000
but here's the struggle in all this.

747
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.600
I'm sure those original hearers when when Micah said this and Micah 4.

748
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.700
He said it to them they struggled with this. I'm sure many of

749
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.800
you me we struggle with this as well because

750
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.400
we look around they for sure. We look around even

751
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.400
today and we see things so far from

752
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.400
God's ideal, right?

753
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.200
The kingdom of God is coming. It's already but

754
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.100
not yet. It's coming and we're looking around like

755
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.700
see much of it.

756
00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.800
So what do we do with that?

757
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.900
What should our response be to that?

758
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.500
That lack that we see.

759
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.500
was a lot of things we already seen we can do but one thing for sure is this should

760
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.100
spur in us a deeper longing for the

761
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:14.800
kingdom of God.

762
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.600
That we should long for this Kingdom

763
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.400
desire want this Kingdom to come.

764
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.500
I guess just spur in us a different heartbeat that

765
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.500
we have a glimpse of it. Yes, but the the best life that

766
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.000
we're gonna live is not now.

767
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.800
The best life is one day coming.

768
00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.800
That's what we're hoping. And that's what we know is coming.

769
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.300
That's why we can have hope even the midst of Crisis today

770
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.300
because we know something is fixed on the other

771
00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.300
side. I read this definition of hope. I love this. It says

772
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.300
a future trust that the things planned will

773
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.100
be accomplished because the person in charge is able

774
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.800
to make good on the promises that were made.

775
00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.400
It's not just hoping that it does actually happen. It's hoping

776
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.400
in those surely going to happen because the

777
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.000
one who made the promise is definitely going to make it happen.

778
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.500
And he's proven himself over and over throughout history.

779
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.400
So Hear Me church, we never have to worry that the

780
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.900
world is somehow out of control

781
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.700
like we use that term a lot don't we like man the world is out of control?

782
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:20.600
No.

783
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.100
It's not out of control because nothing not disasters

784
00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.700
not evil. Not pandemics not a

785
00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.900
cancer. Not not any persecution. Nothing

786
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.600
can undo or frustrate the

787
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.600
final goal that God has established.

788
00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.800
Now we might not understand it how it all works or how

789
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.400
he's going to take this mess and somehow straighten it

790
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.600
out, but we know he can and we know he will.

791
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.300
As surely as he walked out of that grave on the third

792
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.400
day proves he can do anything and he's

793
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.500
fully in control of even the end the worst thing death.

794
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.400
He's over it.

795
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.100
Which means that one day Church listen one day it will

796
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.700
look like Micah 4.

797
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.500
Where there's a Victorious King reigning over a

798
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.300
delivered city a city that's full of

799
00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.400
holy people from All Nations a city

800
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.400
that's full of Peace a city that's full of his glory. That's

801
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.000
what's coming. So, hang on.

802
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.900
So hang on Long want this

803
00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.100
reversal that God is bringing about

804
00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.900
in your life in the society and one day fully will finish hang on

805
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.300
to him. And as you do as you

806
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.200
trust him be reminded of what he said in Romans 8

807
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.300
of what he is guaranteeing for us. He says

808
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.700
who shall separate us from the love of Christ.

809
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.400
Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or

810
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.400
famine or nakedness or danger or sword? No, in

811
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.500
all these things. We are more than conquerors through

812
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.000
him who loved us.

813
00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.200
For I'm sure that neither death hear me, whatever you're

814
00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.500
facing right now hear me for I

815
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.600
am sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor

816
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.200
rulers nor things present nor things to

817
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.100
come nor powers nor height nor depth nor

818
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.800
anything else in all creation will be able to separate us

819
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.600
from the love of God in Christ. Jesus our lord.

820
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.300
So long for his kingdom to come

821
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.900
Church long for this reversal look to

822
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.400
your king with faith and trust and

823
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.600
as you look to him, let him change your life. Let

824
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.200
him use you to live for him

825
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.600
as the kingdom comes more today than it ever has so

826
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:39.900
far.

827
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.400
longing for the day

828
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.300
when it's finished.

829
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.200
As surely as he said on that cross it is finished. He's going

830
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.300
to finish it. All he will complete the work. He started you

831
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.900
Philippians 1:6 guarantee.

832
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.200
So hang on.
