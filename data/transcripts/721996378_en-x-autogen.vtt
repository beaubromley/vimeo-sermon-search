WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.200
Well, good morning again church. If you're new to our church,

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.100
we're grateful that you are here. Thank you. Please come say hello

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.400
to somebody we did have a great week of VBS as you've seen already

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.400
that it's an honor to get together as a church

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.300
like that and serve together with with such a great staff team

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.700
and hundreds of volunteers on the team. It really doesn't

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.100
happen without that. And so just want to say thank you

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.200
for praying and giving and serving so that it

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.300
would happen because hundreds of kids heard the gospel over and

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.200
over this week. They knew they were loved and they had

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.000
a great time of course with it.

12
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.300
So, thank you.

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.900
But today we're continuing through our Series in Jesus's

14
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.200
parables in Luke and we're looking at these stories

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.700
with a purpose and why did Jesus tell them and what did they mean and

16
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.400
this morning? We're going to see a parable that will again as most all

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.200
of them have illustrate how the values of this

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.500
world are often backwards to the

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.200
values of God's kingdom and how he

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.000
says he wants his people to live.

21
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.700
And as I was thinking about this one this week, my sports brain immediately

22
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.000
went to scoreboards.

23
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.500
You know, what a scoreboard is right, you know the primary purpose

24
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
of a scoreboard is to tell the score

25
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.800
of the game.

26
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500
Well more than that. Really when you look at a scoreboard you're

27
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.400
looking for who's winning the game, right? You're

28
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.600
trying to figure out how much time is left. But really the point is who is

29
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
ahead.

30
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.800
And that works in Sports. No problem. That is absolutely fine.

31
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.300
but in life

32
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.600
as we'll see in the parable that will study today.

33
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.100
We can easily trust in the wrong scoreboard.

34
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.100
We can trust the wrong scoreboard in life,

35
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100
especially.

36
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.200
Dealing with money.

37
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
Now here's what might be easy for you to do with this

38
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.700
as we go through today.

39
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.400
As you listen to this you might think and be

40
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.100
tempted to write it off as not for

41
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.300
you.

42
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.400
That it doesn't apply to you because you're not like Scrooge

43
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.400
McDuck remember him like swimming through his

44
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.500
money like that. You're not that and so you're like that. This isn't

45
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.300
about me.

46
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.900
But I believe that God.

47
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.900
Wants to show each of us.

48
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.500
How Deeply

49
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.200
the deception

50
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.400
of the American dream has bled into every

51
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.000
one of our hearts.

52
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.000
That we have a false view of success.

53
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.300
and fulfillment

54
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.300
that if I can just get my retirement fully funded then

55
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.700
then I'll be secure.

56
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.000
Or I want a little bit bigger house always or

57
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.500
or I I want to a little safer

58
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.200
neighborhood or better schools or whatever it is.

59
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.100
And we try to climb this ladder all in

60
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.300
a comparison game with everybody else around us.

61
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.200
That's the point.

62
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.100
See often we trust in the wrong scoreboard.

63
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.400
To see whether we are winning in life.

64
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.900
Luke 12 will press on that deeply today.

65
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.400
And so if you're not already there turn with me to The Gospel According to Luke.

66
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.700
3/4 to the way through the Bible or so third

67
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.700
book of the New Testament Matthew Mark then Luke.

68
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.400
We find it look for the big number 12. That's the chapter

69
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.800
number.

70
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.200
Luke 12 is where we'll be.

71
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.100
The question we need to ask first is what do we learn from this

72
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.400
Parable as we look at this Parable? What do we even learn as

73
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.400
with the other Parables? What's Jesus trying to teach us about his

74
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.000
kingdom about how we are to live in light of his kingdom.

75
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.200
It's what The Parables were for he's separating from the

76
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.200
kingdom Seekers from those who aren't seeking. So what he's showing

77
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.500
us here.

78
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.300
Well here in Luke 12 this point actually starts in

79
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.000
verse 13.

80
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.100
It's before we get to the actual Parable is

81
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.200
not even there yet, but it sets the scene for

82
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.000
why he told the parable here in a second.

83
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.100
So let's look at verses 13 through 15.

84
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.500
Someone in the crowd said to Jesus teacher tell my

85
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.600
brother to divide the inheritance with me.

86
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.200
But he said to him Jesus said back to a man who made

87
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.300
me a judge or arbitrator over you.

88
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.000
And Jesus continued to say to him take care and

89
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.000
be on your guard against all covetousness.

90
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.300
For one's life does not consist in the

91
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.200
abundance of his possessions.

92
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.800
Now remember at the time the inheritance of family would

93
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.600
pass on to the next generation was not divided equally.

94
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.300
That's the word divide there. It was an equal Division and this

95
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.100
man was was wanting the equal division, but actually the firstborn would get

96
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.600
more than the rest of the sons, right.

97
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.100
And so right away this man's question shows his selfishness shows

98
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.100
his jealousy as the younger brother. He's like, hey,

99
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.600
let him divide it with me.

100
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.200
That's why Jesus warned them the whole crowd about

101
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.400
living as if material things are the

102
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.700
Savior that that's where life is found.

103
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.300
And so what's interesting about this parable about to study

104
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.100
is that he actually gave the meaning of the parable before he said

105
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.600
the parable?

106
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.000
That's the meaning right there.

107
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.500
He used the parable in a second as an illustration of

108
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.900
his point, which the point here clearly was to

109
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.100
beware covetousness.

110
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.200
The question prompted his teaching was

111
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.100
beware.

112
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.400
Covetousness beware Being Greedy beware this

113
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.100
desire for more this Envy of others.

114
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.300
So his point beware covetousness and

115
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.000
we need to feel the force.

116
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.700
Of what Jesus said here in verse 15. There's a lot going on here.

117
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.100
See the words Jesus used here in verse 15.

118
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.700
I mean pay careful attention to study make

119
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.200
sure you don't miss anything. And then also he says

120
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.600
actively guard yourself against some

121
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.200
enemy coming.

122
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.100
Imagine a city with walls, he would say

123
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.100
this like post-centuries up on the walls to make

124
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.500
sure that you see an attacker coming and you can make the

125
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.000
first shots.

126
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.300
That's the intensity level.

127
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.700
Jesus brings against covetousness against every

128
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.100
greedy desire for more

129
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.700
in your heart

130
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.400
and why was he so intense because he says

131
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.000
your life.

132
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.400
your your life

133
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.200
Not just your breath and blood flow your life.

134
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.500
Does not consist in the abundance of your possessions.

135
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.800
Many life is not truly measured by how

136
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.400
much you own.

137
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.200
We put another way stop trusting the

138
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.700
wrong scoreboard.

139
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.700
That's not success. That's not value. That's

140
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.700
not worth.

141
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.800
So beware covetousness, but then thankfully Jesus defines

142
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.100
what that looks like.

143
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.200
Well, at least one way greed shows up and

144
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.000
that's the parable of the rich fool that we'll see here in a second.

145
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.300
Look at verses 16 through 21 Jesus continues in the

146
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.300
same conversation.

147
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.000
To the crowd verse 16 he told them a parable.

148
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.700
Saying the land of a rich man produced

149
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.300
plentifully.

150
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.200
And he thought to himself what shall I do for I have nowhere

151
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.500
to store my crops.

152
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.200
And he said well, I'll do this. I'll tear down

153
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.900
my Barns and build larger ones.

154
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.100
And there I'll store all my grain and my

155
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.300
goods.

156
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.200
And I will say to my soul soul. You

157
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.100
have ample Goods laid up for many years. Relax eat

158
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.800
drink be merry

159
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.700
but God said to him.

160
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.500
fool

161
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.200
this night your soul is required of you.

162
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.700
And the things you've prepared who's will they be?

163
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.500
So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is

164
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.400
not rich toward God.

165
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.500
So Jesus already said Beware covetousness that's his point.

166
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.100
Here, the illustration of the parable leads us

167
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.000
to believe and see that we need to also flee foolishness.

168
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.100
in that same process

169
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.500
beware covetousness and flee foolishness

170
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.500
as you do that

171
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.300
I mean as you read back through the parable think about how

172
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.300
many times this Rich fool said I

173
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.500
It's actually six times the word I shows

174
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.600
up and then another five times my shows up,

175
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:00.800
right?

176
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.300
And that's on purpose. Jesus is just illustrating. This man's selfishness.

177
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.700
This man thought that having a solid 401K would

178
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.600
free him up to relax to spend his days

179
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.400
live in the high life going on vacations going

180
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.100
golfing spending time with parties and friends like

181
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.200
he thought this was gonna be the dream.

182
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.000
Here's the thing though.

183
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.600
If every one of us in this room was brutally honest.

184
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.100
all of that

185
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

186
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.700
Like we want that kind of life. We we're up.

187
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.400
It's appealing to us. In fact, like that's what

188
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.500
people work for.

189
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.400
To retire early or to be able to retire at

190
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.700
some point just say here's what I'm gonna live for.

191
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.200
It's like it's like heavy from Fiddler on the Roof. If

192
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.600
you've ever seen that musical when he was told that money is

193
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.100
the world's curse.

194
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.600
He responded. Well, may the Lord smite me

195
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.800
with it. And may I never recover?

196
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.600
There is this there's this low-grade greed that

197
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.100
all of us have like man, I would be great. I'd love to have

198
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.400
that.

199
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.100
but again

200
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.600
the man and the parable had made it he had it all he

201
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.300
was set.

202
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.500
Yet the first word out of God's mouth in

203
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.400
verse 20 is what?

204
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.200
fool

205
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.500
God called this man a fool.

206
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.300
Now wait a second.

207
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.400
I thought God was loved God is love right. That sounds

208
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.300
pretty harsh. How is he? So unkind to this

209
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.800
man now God loves everyone. Yes.

210
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.500
And he loves everyone enough to tell them the truth about the

211
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.500
status of their life and their heart and

212
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.200
their future.

213
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.700
And for this wealthy man the evidence of his

214
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.500
heart and in his life pointed to nothing but

215
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.500
arrogance and greediness.

216
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.500
I mean just think about what happened here first. He failed to

217
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.100
acknowledge that the land had produced plentifully.

218
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.600
Like in the end he had nothing to do with the results.

219
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.400
Right. Yeah, we we plant and we water yes, but the

220
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.500
growth is up to God not to us.

221
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.200
You can do everything right and and it still doesn't produce right?

222
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.700
So he failed to acknowledge God and that but even further once he received

223
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.800
this massive Harvest his first thought

224
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.900
was to selfish materialism.

225
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.000
He did not acknowledge God in any way.

226
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.300
That's what Psalm 14 verse 1 actually says the

227
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.400
fool says in his heart.

228
00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.800
There is no God.

229
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.200
Whether you actually believe there is no God.

230
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.700
Or whether you just live like it.

231
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.800
It's foolish.

232
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.100
Now again, let's go back to what I said at the start you might be

233
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.500
looking at this Parable and think it's not a problem for me. I'm

234
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.500
just trying to make ends meet like I barely have enough at

235
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.300
the end of the month every month like how this is not a problem

236
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.500
for me, but remember this

237
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.200
You don't have to have a lot to be greedy.

238
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400
to be materialistic

239
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.300
It's all about your heart.

240
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.200
That you selfishly want more.

241
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.900
To have more Comforts and more conveniences or

242
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.100
nicer and newer things.

243
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.200
It's the same heart problem this man has.

244
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.400
And plus as soon as we start to live as

245
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.800
if we don't need God.

246
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.100
That what we have in this world will sustain

247
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.400
us not him. Then we start

248
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.400
to get off track.

249
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.700
So whether you can actually ever obtain it

250
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.800
or not. Don't let the American

251
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.100
dream Define the way you live your life.

252
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.300
It's the wrong scoreboard.

253
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.300
Because Jesus says here's the way to avoid that.

254
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.800
To truly take to heart the question. Jesus asked in

255
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.400
verse 20

256
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.400
Which by the way the only time God shows up as an actor

257
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.500
in a parable is here in verse 20.

258
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.600
Where God shows up to this man and asks a

259
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.400
question remember what it says God said to

260
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.300
him fool this night. Your soul is required of you the things

261
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.300
you have prepared. Whose will they be?

262
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.700
Meaning they're not going to be yours anymore.

263
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.800
And so what Jesus did with this Parable is he

264
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.900
flipped the scoreboard on this Rich fool?

265
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.400
By saying the most important thing is not how much you have.

266
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.900
The most important thing is where is your soul going?

267
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.900
What's going to happen with your soul?

268
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.500
This man's Day of Reckoning came.

269
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.900
Just like it's coming for you and for me.

270
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.600
And listen, you can't stand before God and impress him

271
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.200
with your 401k or your house or

272
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.400
your bank account or whatever else. You can't stand there and

273
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.900
press God by the way, all that's going to somebody else anyway.

274
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.200
You don't get to take it with you. The only

275
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.600
thing that matters on that day is his view of your soul.

276
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.800
Whether it whether your soul whether you turned

277
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.900
from sin turn from materialism and

278
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.200
turn to Jesus life death and Resurrection in

279
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.700
your place. Did you do that? Do you value him? It's

280
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.100
what Jesus said in verse 21 is he continued that

281
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.300
this is most important. He said so is the one who lays up

282
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.200
treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.

283
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.100
Like the comparison game there.

284
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.400
What that means is you have a choice where you're

285
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.500
going to place your satisfaction.

286
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.800
Where you are going to place your hearts treasure?

287
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.300
What he says here is that temporary riches will not

288
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.400
last are not satisfying. So instead of

289
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.300
pursuing those things cherishing those things cherish

290
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.200
godliness.

291
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.000
At this point with verse 21 cherish godliness.

292
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.000
Be rich toward God.

293
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.300
This is trusting the right scoreboard.

294
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.500
This is where you know, your soul is

295
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.600
most important but but think about that phrase what is being rich

296
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.600
toward God even mean.

297
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.400
I mean, he's going to give me a wealth. What's he talking about

298
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.600
here? How can we be rich toward God.

299
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.600
Well that word Rich means to be plentifully supplied with

300
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:14.900
something.

301
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.300
Money here, of course, but but it can mean other things plentifly supplied

302
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.100
with something. So what what's he talking about

303
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.700
being rich toward god, well in the context of spiritual riches the

304
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.300
thing you're plentively supplied with is Grace, right?

305
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.400
It's Grace.

306
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.800
That you're a big sinner.

307
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.100
covered with bigger Grace

308
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.500
you are rich.

309
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.200
wealthy

310
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.800
that even though you didn't deserve it God chose you and saved you

311
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.300
and covered all of your sin with his son's

312
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.500
blood. That is true wealth, right?

313
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.900
And that's what makes us truly Rich According To Jesus because what

314
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.500
that leads to is then our new aim

315
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.400
in life is to serve him as king spend

316
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.500
his resources entrusted to us for his glory for

317
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.300
his kingdom. That makes us then wealthy Rich

318
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.800
toward God.

319
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.700
I love how First Timothy 6.

320
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.500
Sums all of this up. So well talking about this tension

321
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.300
that we're walking in. It says godliness with contentment

322
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.400
is great gain.

323
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.300
For we brought nothing into the world. We cannot take anything out of

324
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.400
the world. But if we have food and clothing with these will

325
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.000
be content.

326
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.600
But those who desire to be rich fall into

327
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.500
temptation into a snare into many

328
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.500
senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin

329
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.000
and destruction.

330
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.300
For the Love of Money is a root of all kinds of

331
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.000
evils.

332
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.200
And it's through this craving that some have wandered away from

333
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.000
the faith and pierced themselves with many pains.

334
00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.800
See the rich fool in the parable.

335
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.300
He missed life.

336
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.200
By presuming that possessions are life.

337
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.800
When actually godliness with contentment is

338
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.200
where true life is actually found.

339
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.700
But here's the problem with all this.

340
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.100
See, you know as well as I do.

341
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.400
That the cultural current in which we

342
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:30.700
live.

343
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.400
Flows in the exact opposite direction of this

344
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.000
mentality.

345
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.100
everything around us

346
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.300
And even much of what's inside of us?

347
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.300
It screams for us to be selfish and

348
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.300
materialistic and greedy.

349
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.600
right it

350
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.700
the system is designed.

351
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.000
To make us discontent in our lives.

352
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.200
Every single commercial you have on television.

353
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.400
It's designed.

354
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.900
To make you want more and new and better.

355
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.200
to compare

356
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.500
and so when we look at what Jesus said in Luke 12

357
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.500
What first Timothy six it is? Is that impossible?

358
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.300
Is what Jesus said impulse, how can we possibly do

359
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.600
all of what he just said to do?

360
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.900
Like how can we guard ourselves against greed?

361
00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.100
When we fill this constant pressure to keep up with the

362
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.700
Joneses.

363
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.200
Again, I've said this before I'm sorry. If your last name is Jones, that's just unfortunate with

364
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:44.600
that, right?

365
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.000
How can we flee foolishness

366
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.300
when when all of the world is about

367
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.400
bigger and better and self?

368
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.200
How can we cherish godliness in this

369
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.400
kind of world that we live in? It's nearly impossible, right?

370
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.200
Well, thankfully Jesus followed up the parable that he

371
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.700
just taught.

372
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.200
With with further teaching on how we can

373
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.500
ever do this how we can pursue godliness how we

374
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.200
can trust the correct scoreboard in our

375
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.000
lives like we can see him show us how to do it.

376
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.400
In the first way is by remembering

377
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.500
that God will provide.

378
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.600
We are able to resist greed

379
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.900
to flee foolishness and trust this

380
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.700
scoreboard that Jesus puts in

381
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.000
front of us because we know he's going to provide for

382
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.500
our needs.

383
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.300
We keep reading in Luke 12 starting in verse 22.

384
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.100
See what Jesus says to his disciples now. He

385
00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.900
talked to the crowd told the parable, but he remembers dividing and

386
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.400
his disciples then need to hear this.

387
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.600
He said to the disciples. Therefore I tell you do not be anxious

388
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.400
about your life.

389
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.800
What you will eat nor about your body what you'll put on.

390
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.500
For life is more than food and the body more

391
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.100
than clothing sounds familiar, right?

392
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.400
Consider the Ravens they neither sow nor reap they have

393
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.200
neither Storehouse nor barn and yet God feeds them.

394
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.900
Of how much more value are you than the birds?

395
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.300
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to

396
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.500
his span of life if then you are not able to do a smaller

397
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.300
thing as that. Why are you anxious about the rest?

398
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.400
Consider the lilies how they grow they neither toil nor spin

399
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.500
mean they don't work at all yet. I tell you even Solomon in

400
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.600
all his glory was not arrayed like one of these

401
00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.200
but if God's so close the grass, which is

402
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.200
alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven. How

403
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.700
much more will he clothe you?

404
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.800
Oh you have little faith.

405
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.200
And do not seek what you are to eat what you are to

406
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.300
drink nor be worried.

407
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.800
For all the nations of the world seek after these things and your

408
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.200
father knows that you need them.

409
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.300
Instead seek his kingdom and these

410
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.400
things will be added to you.

411
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.600
See what Jesus just said.

412
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.500
Is that we are able to focus on the true life

413
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.500
that he offers us by seeking his kingdom

414
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:25.800
first.

415
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.600
By seeking him leading us to then stop

416
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.600
worrying. Like we're putting our focus on him. It leads

417
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.100
us to stop worrying so much about what he's going to give us

418
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.500
whether we'll have enough or not.

419
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.200
If we trust him that he is the king he is

420
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.500
our good father. He's going to provide.

421
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.600
Like with the birds here, right? Jesus mentioned these birds.

422
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.500
You don't see them renting out storage units,

423
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:51.800
right?

424
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.100
Like I kind of chuckle every time I drive down the road because it

425
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.200
seems like everywhere. There's a new storage unit being built.

426
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.500
If that's not an indication that this is a problem for

427
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.100
us in America. I don't know what is

428
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.100
just garages full of stuff and stuff and

429
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.100
stuff, right?

430
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.400
The birds don't do that.

431
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.200
They just trust their father. They worship they live. They

432
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.600
seek the kingdom in a sense. That's what they were wired

433
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:21.800
to do.

434
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.300
and God provides

435
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.400
when we trust God's provision, then we're less

436
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.300
susceptible.

437
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.000
to the Trap of materialism

438
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.900
to trusting stuff instead of God

439
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.600
But there's a second way Jesus says he says not only

440
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.600
is God going to provide for you. He also says shift your

441
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.800
scoreboard because God's also going to bless you.

442
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.800
God is going to bless you to bless others.

443
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.000
Look at verses 32 through 34. He continues all

444
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.500
about this theme of don't be anxious. Don't worry fear

445
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.700
not little flock.

446
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.400
For it is your father's good pleasure to give you

447
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.000
the kingdom.

448
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.700
Sell your possessions give to the needy.

449
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.600
Provide yourself with money bags that do not grow old

450
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.500
with a treasure in the heavens that does

451
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.600
not fail where no Thief approaches and no

452
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.500
moth destroys.

453
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.100
For where your treasure is?

454
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.400
There will your heart be also.

455
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.400
Talk about the kingdom talking about true wealth and here Jesus ties it with

456
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.100
generosity.

457
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.200
He says here's what it looks like to trust the kingdom is

458
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.600
to give generously because God's going to provide joy in

459
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.800
all that you do in that because think about that word treasure,

460
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.000
right?

461
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.900
That word treasure means when something is considered

462
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.000
valuable.

463
00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.400
I've used this one before but like Gollum with the

464
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:00.700
ring, right?

465
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.700
My press right. So he's he's treasuring

466
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.500
that ring. What because

467
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.400
he sees in his valuable. He sees it as Something's Gonna

468
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.500
Give him Joy gonna be his hope in all of

469
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.400
life. That's what he's finding the pirates with the treasure chest.

470
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.400
That's what they're looking for to find Joy the

471
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.800
rich fool in the parable.

472
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.700
Was finding his treasure in more stuff more money

473
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.700
more ease.

474
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.500
At that money and resources would give him the relaxation and partying

475
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.700
that he's so craved and that that was what he was trusting in

476
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.300
and Jesus called that foolish.

477
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.500
But I want to flip the script.

478
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.000
Here for a second.

479
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.400
What if that same man?

480
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.800
Treasured joy in the Lord instead.

481
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.500
He was trusting and treasuring this stuff. What if instead

482
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.100
he was actually treasuring joy and look

483
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.100
what if he cherished godliness as Jesus said he should

484
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.100
and when he received all of the extra he gave the

485
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.700
extra away.

486
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.300
That's what Jesus just said to do, right what he had enough for

487
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.300
him and his family. He saved some for next

488
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.300
year, but then he just blessed his village.

489
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.100
think of the joy

490
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:23.900
for them

491
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.200
and for him

492
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.200
What if the man would have said John Piper put it this way? What if

493
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.200
the man would have said?

494
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.200
God this is all yours.

495
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.000
You have made my Fields Prosper show me

496
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.400
how to express with my riches

497
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.300
that you are my treasure and the riches are

498
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:46.500
not.

499
00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.400
I already have enough. I don't need a bigger safety net. I

500
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.200
don't need better food better drink better parties.

501
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.800
I do want to make Mary. Yes, but not in

502
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.400
self-indulgent parties with Rich retirees.

503
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.800
I want to make Mary with the people who have been helped by my generosity.

504
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.600
I want the fullest blessing of giving

505
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.900
because Jesus you taught me. It is

506
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.600
more blessed to give.

507
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.400
Than to receive.

508
00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.400
Like what if that was this man's perspective?

509
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.700
What if he gets this huge evidence of

510
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.400
God's blessing and that's his perspective

511
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.300
because remember this this man had no idea that

512
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.600
that was his last night.

513
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.600
Didn't know it was coming.

514
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.700
He thought he was Secure.

515
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.000
He thought his wealth would prevent death, but it didn't.

516
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.500
Plus think about the man never even got to benefit from it.

517
00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.200
everybody else did

518
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.900
He just missed out on the party.

519
00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:57.900
right

520
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.000
Everybody else got all of the extra.

521
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:02.700
he could have

522
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.800
had a part and enjoyed it with them.

523
00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.200
And so listen, one of the common questions that we talked a

524
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.700
lot about money the last month or two.

525
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.000
If God gives you the ability to make a lot

526
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.400
of money.

527
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:18.600
Great.

528
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.200
Notice the man was not called a fool for being a

529
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.100
productive farmer.

530
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.600
He was not called a fool for being wealthy.

531
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:31.600
the question

532
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.900
is what will you do with it?

533
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.100
the question is

534
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.000
Does it lead your heart to be thorny soil?

535
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.000
Where that materialistic life chokes

536
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.100
out the work of God in your life.

537
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.200
Does it lead you to be thorny soil or does it lead you

538
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.500
to be more generous?

539
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.500
I started in first Timothy 6 earlier. Here's how

540
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.500
it continues.

541
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.500
It says As for the rich in this present age

542
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.700
charge them not to be haughty or arrogant nor

543
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.900
to set their hopes on the uncertainty of

544
00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.100
riches as we see in the world around us right now.

545
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.900
But on God set your Hope on God who richly

546
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.200
provides us with everything to enjoy.

547
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.700
They are to do good to be rich in Good

548
00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.000
Works to be generous and ready to share.

549
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.500
The storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for

550
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.100
the future.

551
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.500
So they may take hold of that which is truly life.

552
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.000
You're blessed to be a blessing.

553
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.200
It's where life is found.

554
00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.000
but in all this

555
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.600
there's an implication of a warning here.

556
00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.700
That if we are seeking life in our stuff.

557
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.700
Or in the pleasures of the world rather than

558
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.400
in God himself, then we need to beware.

559
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.200
Just in the parable itself. There is a warning like

560
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.000
that Soul was required of him that very night.

561
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.500
There's a day coming when Jesus will

562
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.700
return and call the question on us.

563
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.800
Jesus will return.

564
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.100
In fact, that's how he continues as he's teaching his disciples how to

565
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:35.500
live this truth out. He says in verse 35 stay dressed

566
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.100
for action.

567
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.500
Keep your lamps burning and be like men who are waiting for their Master to

568
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.400
come home from the wedding Feast so they may open the

569
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.000
door to him at once when he comes and knocks blessed are

570
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.300
those servants whom the master finds awake when

571
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:49.400
he comes?

572
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.400
Truly I say to you. He'll dress himself for service and have them recline at

573
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.400
table. He'll come and serve them. This is talking about eternity.

574
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.800
Jesus showing that to his disciples. We're seeing it forever if

575
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.200
he comes though, listen 38 if he comes in the

576
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.200
second watch or in the third and finds them awake blessed are those servants?

577
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.200
But then he kind of shifts the parable but know this that if the master

578
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.400
the house had known it what hour the thief was coming. He would not have left this house

579
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.100
to be broken into.

580
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.100
Kind of a second the idea that if you know when the thief

581
00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.500
is coming you're not gonna leave the door wide open.

582
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.100
But verse 40 this is the point. You also must be ready.

583
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.900
For the son of man is coming at an hour. You do not expect.

584
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.100
the rich fool

585
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.000
doesn't matter how much you have on that day.

586
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.500
If all you've been living for is your house.

587
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.000
Or your car or your resume?

588
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.900
Or your collection of seashells.

589
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.700
Or Vacations or whatever it is. If that's your

590
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.000
focus what you're going to hear on that day is full.

591
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.000
Today your soul is required of you.

592
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.500
And the urgency implied here is that no

593
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.800
one knows when that day will be.

594
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.300
You don't know when that Reckoning moment is coming when the

595
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.700
judge will come back. And so you better be ready all the time.

596
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.300
It might be tonight.

597
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.600
That's why you cannot say I'll take

598
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.100
care of it. Later.

599
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.100
that's why you cannot say once I get my 401k funded

600
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.000
then I'll give

601
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.400
or I'll follow Jesus wholeheartedly once I get out of college. I got

602
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.500
I got to enjoy this, right?

603
00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.500
Do not delay.

604
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.300
James 4 says it clearly come now you who say

605
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.100
today or tomorrow will go into such and such a town and spend a

606
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.400
year there and trade and make a profit yet. You do not know what tomorrow

607
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.300
will bring. What is your life? You are

608
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.500
a Mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.

609
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.300
Instead you ought to say if the Lord Wills will live and do

610
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.800
this or that meaning it's up to God as it is you boast

611
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.300
in your arrogance. All such boasting

612
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.000
is evil.

613
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.400
So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it for him.

614
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.800
It is sin.

615
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.400
We've seen it clearly today.

616
00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:31.100
What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world yet

617
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.200
forfeits his soul.

618
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.000
the current of the world is

619
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.700
pulling us toward trusting the wrong scoreboard.

620
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.500
And I was thinking about this last night that the relevant question

621
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.400
came up in light of Father's Day today.

622
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.300
And so dads, let me ask you mom's you're

623
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.000
included in this too. But the dads let me think with you for a second.

624
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.600
What's the goal you have for your kids?

625
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.600
Is it that they would be prosperous and moral?

626
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.100
Just decent human beings who are able to make a lot

627
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.300
of money successful.

628
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.100
again that ends

629
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.700
in despair

630
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.000
It's antithetical to God's kingdom values.

631
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.200
Because our true goal for our kids should be to help

632
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.900
them adore Jesus and to help them join him

633
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.900
in bringing in God's Kingdom.

634
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.400
That is absolutely number one over

635
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.600
everything else.

636
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.300
Because remember God would much rather us be rich toward him

637
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.400
than Rich here.

638
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.200
And there's a huge difference between those two things. That's the

639
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.500
right scoreboard that we focus on godliness. We we focus

640
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.300
on a relationship with him. We focus on building up

641
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.600
other believers and giving generously and prioritizing the

642
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.000
kingdom of God. That's what life is found

643
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.200
in.

644
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.500
That's what the martyred missionary Jim Elliot once said.

645
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.500
He said he is no fool who gives up

646
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.400
what he cannot keep to gain what

647
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.000
he cannot lose.

648
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.300
Don't trust the wrong scoreboard for you

649
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.400
for your kids.

650
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.000
Give your life.

651
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.200
To the secure one.

652
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:36.700
named Jesus

653
00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.400
but here's how I want to close.

654
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.500
See the goal of all of this today is not to create.

655
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.600
some feeling of Works based salvation

656
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.800
and we just walk away beat up by these impossibilities.

657
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.600
Now we should be absolutely critical of American materialism.

658
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.300
Yes.

659
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.700
Because it's so often the stumbling block

660
00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.500
in the way of our pursuit of Jesus.

661
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.500
We should call it out rightly.

662
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.100
But hear me the hope of the Gospel in light of

663
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.800
this Parable the hope of the Gospel is this.

664
00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.300
On the day that Jesus does return.

665
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.100
On that day you die or Jesus

666
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.800
returns. You will not be presenting to him the last

667
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.200
thing that you did with your life.

668
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.200
And you better make sure it's right. You better make sure that you get

669
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.800
it all together in that. No, you will be presenting to him the

670
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.400
last thing that Jesus did with his life for

671
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:43.500
you.

672
00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.300
Right because remember Jesus lived the perfect life you

673
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.200
could never live. I mean he overcame greed and covetousness perfectly.

674
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.200
He lived a perfectly wise life

675
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.800
was never foolish and he cherished his father above

676
00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.700
all else in his life. Then he carried

677
00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.900
our imperfections to the Cross. That's

678
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.300
what you will hold up and say this is my only

679
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:06.600
hope

680
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.300
If you're holding anything else up.

681
00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.400
How well you did how generous you were you're holding anything

682
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.300
else? It's not going to make it Jesus in your place

683
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.000
is the only thing and that's what the Lord will judge you on.

684
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.500
That's what then if we really get that into our souls

685
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.900
what motivates us then to do that.

686
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.000
We've just said the whole time.

687
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.700
That's what motivates us to say. I want to know him more. I

688
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.500
want to make him known more. I'm gonna release everything

689
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.300
counted all as loss for the sake

690
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:38.900
of knowing him.

691
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.900
Is only when you know, you're going to stand before Jesus

692
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.000
secure.

693
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.200
forever

694
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.200
that gives you the courage to do all the other stuff we've talked about

695
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:49.500
today.

696
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.300
This Jesus is better.

697
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.400
Than anything else Church?

698
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.400
so let's believe that more today and tomorrow

699
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.400
and the next day then we ever have

700
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.700
he is better.
