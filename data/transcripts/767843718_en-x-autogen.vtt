00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.500
Who is

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.900
the god like Yahweh the god

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.500
of wrath the god of Mercy The

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.000
God Who reaches down to unworthy

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.200
people.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.300
Well, good morning again beloved as you

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.000
can see, we do have some technical difficulties today.

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300
If you're just coming in joining us. None of

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.600
these speakers up here work today. Don't know why that's just

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.700
what you're dealing with with a 15 year old system sometimes so

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.500
the only speakers that you're hearing me through and are worship

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.400
team are through the front underneath the stage speaking right

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.600
here. So if you're in the front section here just know if I

14
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.900
start yelling as I preach you're gonna maybe I don't know but so you

15
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.400
want to move I don't I'm not gonna get offended by that, but that's

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.200
just what we're dealing with today. And so we know what the Lord

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.100
is still going to do what he wants to do. So thankful for that

18
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
and thank you for flexibility in these times as

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.400
we go

20
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.100
But also want to say a quick thank you before we get too far into this

21
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.000
to my sermon review team. If you did not

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.600
know that we do this every week. I have a small group of men and

23
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.900
women that gather together on Tuesday and and hear

24
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.300
my sermon as 75% form

25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.500
as it is at the time and they give helpful insights applications illustrations.

26
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.000
They help clarify some things that

27
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.600
I've maybe not been clear about and it's just a simple powerful

28
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.300
way that they serve the church they serve you and they

29
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.500
serve me they help me grow in my ability to

30
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.300
preach and so I just want to say thank you to them regularly as

31
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.400
they serve that way.

32
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.800
Yes, praise God for that. I am exponentially

33
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.300
better because of them and we are benefited by

34
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.800
that too. And so as we journey through the Old Testament Book of Micah we're

35
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.400
into chapter 7 now. So take your copy of God's word. Turn

36
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.400
with me to Micah 7.

37
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.100
Just a couple weeks left in the series will end it right before

38
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.200
Thanksgiving hints. And so one of the most as you're

39
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.800
turning there one of the most frustrating occurrences when you're traveling

40
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.000
in any capacity in an airline

41
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.800
travel is a delayed flight.

42
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.100
You know what? I mean, maybe you've experienced this that you get

43
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.200
to the airport two hours early like you're supposed to and you get in there

44
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.700
and then the the screen flashes delayed.

45
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.300
And so what do you do you have this reality that there's

46
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.500
nothing you can do about it, right? You just have to sit there and those super

47
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.000
comfortable chairs as well and and try to

48
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.600
eat your fifteen dollar sandwich without spilling mustard on your shirt. Somehow

49
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.400
like you got just wait it out in those kind of things but

50
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.400
there's a further problem here because you're sitting there your gate

51
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.400
and next to you at their gate. They're boarding their flight to

52
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.400
Des Moines and you're watching them and they're just fine. Everything's good

53
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.700
for them.

54
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.700
But that can lead to is frustration though

55
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.300
because you're sitting here watching this happen over there and you're

56
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.700
sitting here at your gate and you're sitting you're looking at these employees

57
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.400
at your gate who, you know probably could

58
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.200
do something about your problem, but they seem like they're not doing anything

59
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.600
just standing around drinking coffee.

60
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.400
You know, I think there's a measure that frustration that we can feel towards

61
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.700
God.

62
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.400
at times

63
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600
whenever it's appears to us.

64
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.400
That he's not doing anything about the evil

65
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.800
and wickedness in our world.

66
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.900
Like we look around and we see blatant ethnic

67
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.500
Prejudice and we ask the question Where's God

68
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.900
in this?

69
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.700
We see adultery destroying families and

70
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.900
we wonder where is God?

71
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.600
We see drugs and alcohol killing people and

72
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.100
people killing for it.

73
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.400
Where's God

74
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.900
We see abuse and cover-ups see sex

75
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.300
trafficking and we ask the question. Where is

76
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.800
God in this?

77
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.500
We see greed and and lies and

78
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.300
invasions and Wars.

79
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.700
Where's God

80
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.100
Even if you're a believer.

81
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.200
You can be tempted.

82
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.400
To think that somehow God is delayed.

83
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.500
That he's not really working all things out for his

84
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.700
glory and for our good.

85
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.400
Or maybe you're even further tempted to think that

86
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.900
maybe God's not strong enough to deal with these problems.

87
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.200
That the enemy is just going to win out like he appears to be winning right

88
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.300
now.

89
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.200
He's just gonna win in the end.

90
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.500
That's why we must understand what Micah has to

91
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.900
show us today in Chapter 7.

92
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.000
That God's Deliverance is always on time.

93
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.400
That's the truth today if you get nothing else.

94
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.500
God's Deliverance is always on time. It

95
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.300
might not be on our timetable, but it's never

96
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.600
late.

97
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.600
It's been said this way the wheels of Justice may

98
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.200
seem to turn slowly, but they

99
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200
turn surely.

100
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.200
Pray that today you would see that and that it would give you courage.

101
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.400
to stand fast in whatever your facing

102
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.400
but first as we get into it today, we need to understand Micah situation.

103
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.000
What was he facing in his situation that he

104
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.100
was walking through with his people of Judah.

105
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.700
Well, the situation was that we're getting near to the end of this collection of sermons that

106
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.400
Micah preached to Judah over a number of years. This is

107
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.200
a gathering of messages. He preached and

108
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.800
and what we've seen throughout the book is that they've been building.

109
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.000
These later messages repeat themes that

110
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.200
we've seen throughout the book all the way through it things like

111
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.500
God's holiness God's judgment on sin.

112
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.600
The coming restoration of this Kingdom that God's promised.

113
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.400
Yes. Those are all themes but these themes have crescendowed

114
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.300
throughout the book.

115
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.200
Which my fellow band folks would understand right? That

116
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.000
means it's building. It's getting louder. It's getting more intense throughout

117
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.100
the book.

118
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.700
That's what we're going to see here in Micah 7.

119
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.400
That what Micah was observing in his people was now as

120
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.500
far as they could go.

121
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.000
It says were it's bad. It's the worst it's ever been.

122
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.100
Throughout the book. He's looking around and saying this is a

123
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.300
tragic situation.

124
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.200
Look at verses 1 through 6 of Micah 7.

125
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.200
Woe is me for I've become as when the summer

126
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.100
fruit has been gathered as when the grapes have been

127
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.400
gleaned. There's no cluster to eat. No first ripe fig

128
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.600
that my soul desires.

129
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.700
The Godly is perished from the earth and there is no one upright among

130
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.300
mankind.

131
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.700
They all lie and wait for blood and each hunts

132
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.700
the other with a net.

133
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.600
Their hands are on what is evil to do it. Well The Prince

134
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.600
and the judge ask for a bribe the great man utters the

135
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.200
evil desire of his soul as they weave it

136
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.300
together.

137
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.200
The best of them is like a briar the most

138
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.400
upright of them a thorn hedge.

139
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.200
The day of your Watchman of your punishment has come.

140
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.900
Now they're confusion is at hand.

141
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.300
Put no trust in a neighbor have no confidence in

142
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.400
a friend guard the doors of your mouth from her who

143
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.600
lies in your arms for the sun treats the

144
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.400
father with contempt the daughter Rises up against her mother

145
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.300
the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law a Man's

146
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.800
enemies are the men of his own house.

147
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.900
Like you see this tragic situation, don't you?

148
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.300
I mean in one way Micah is speaking on behalf of the people that they

149
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.600
should feel this. But primarily he's speaking for himself where

150
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.700
he feels the evil of those around him.

151
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.100
And he laments it, right?

152
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.200
He Compares himself in verse 1 to a stripped branch. No fruit

153
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.200
on it like this. There's just this branch that

154
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.600
goes and you you see nothing on it. It's it's winter. It's

155
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.600
dead. It's empty.

156
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.400
And then in verse 2, he feels like Abraham remember Abraham

157
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.700
and Genesis 18 interceded on behalf of the city of Sodom and

158
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.200
like God just find a few people and they're still following you.

159
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.600
But here he says there's none left it appears.

160
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.200
In fact, not only have they abandoned God.

161
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.100
They've even gone full Hunger Games on each other and they're hunting each

162
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.900
other for sports.

163
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.300
Verse three adds. The people are trying to improve how they

164
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.500
do evil like they're practicing how to get better at

165
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.100
sinning.

166
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.500
leaders getting paid off

167
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.300
great men speaking evil desires

168
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.500
They're so far gone verse 4 says the best of them

169
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.200
is like that goat head sticker that you get in

170
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.800
your shoelace that just hurts like fire when you touch it, right?

171
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.800
the best of them are like that

172
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.500
Mike even laments the fact that instead of what we

173
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.200
saw in Micah 6:8 the justice and faithfulness That was

174
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.300
supposed to characterize God's people instead of

175
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.700
that.

176
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.900
No one could trust anybody else.

177
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.700
No, neighbor, no friend. No family member not even

178
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.000
your own spouse. Could you trust at all?

179
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.500
This is how far Judah had now come.

180
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.100
Everything we've seen them doing throughout the Book of Micah now

181
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.500
culminated in this the wicked state

182
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.500
of the people. We see it clearly which is

183
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.500
why Micah would naturally begin to question God,

184
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:53.800
right?

185
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.100
Because God you've promised.

186
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.200
To clean this up to restore these things, but it's

187
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.800
not happening.

188
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.100
What what is this Kingdom you're talking about? I know it's

189
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.200
still future, but it sure seems like you were going to get this better than it is. It

190
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.300
only seemed to be getting worse?

191
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.500
People getting farther away from God not closer to

192
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:15.900
him.

193
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:21.800
even today

194
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.200
as I started with and

195
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.300
And as I heard growing up from previous generations even

196
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.300
today it can seem like the world is going to hell in

197
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:32.900
a handbasket.

198
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.900
I don't even know what that means but it sure sounds bad, right?

199
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.500
But seriously, right like it's easy

200
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.400
for us just like Micah to look around and lament the state

201
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:46.700
of our world.

202
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.500
And you see these wicked things.

203
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.200
And you're sitting there at your gate at the airport and you're

204
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.700
wondering why your flight's delayed.

205
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.600
Like God don't aren't you gonna fix this?

206
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800
But let's remember something.

207
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.000
Anytime you point a finger at someone else.

208
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.700
There's three fingers pointing back at you.

209
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.800
Because remember who Micah was talking to here.

210
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.100
Who was he talking about here?

211
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.400
He's talking about Judah.

212
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.100
Those who were supposed to be God's people.

213
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.300
He's looking at them having done all of

214
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.200
these things not Assyria not these other countries out there which

215
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.700
he did a little bit. But primarily he's talking to Judah his

216
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.100
own people who were supposed to be gods.

217
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.300
And so when we look at this from our side of this now as we

218
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.700
look and apply these things this whole series of Micah,

219
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.400
right? That's us.

220
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.500
It's the only application we can give is to us today that God

221
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.500
is talking to us that he's called us to be. Holy

222
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.400
set apart to be different to be

223
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.500
a new creation to be absolutely his people

224
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.100
a holy nation for his possession.

225
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.800
Yet as we've said multiple times throughout this series sadly

226
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.300
many people in the church live no different

227
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.700
than the rest of the world around us.

228
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.900
Where we see it all over the place emptily pursuing

229
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.100
the lust of the flesh.

230
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.200
the pride of life

231
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.000
using and abusing people

232
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.600
practicing evil how to get better at it.

233
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.400
lack of trust between Brothers and

234
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.400
Sisters in Christ

235
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.900
It's in US.

236
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.400
And so what's the answer?

237
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.200
How did Micah respond when he looked around and he saw the

238
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.400
mess that he was living in and the way people were living and looked

239
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.100
like nobody was left. He's the only one following Yahweh.

240
00:12:59.500 --> 00:12:59.800
well

241
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.200
He did just like the Prophet Elijah did and ran away

242
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.000
and hid right.

243
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.300
No.

244
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.500
Look at verse 7.

245
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.600
Look at Micah's response.

246
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.800
One through six here's how it's bad and

247
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.200
bad and bad. How bad it's gotten. Here's how horrible life

248
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.400
is right now how everybody's turning

249
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.100
away verse 7

250
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.200
But as for me.

251
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.500
I will look to the Lord.

252
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.300
I will wait for the god of my salvation. My God

253
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.300
will hear me.

254
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.000
beautiful

255
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.600
No one else can be trusted.

256
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.000
No one else is following Yahweh it

257
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.500
seems but as for me he says.

258
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.000
It's like everybody else. You've been to that that Lazy River or you've been

259
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.000
to that that River where you float the tube right? Everybody else is lazily floating

260
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.600
down the current of that evil River and

261
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.900
he says but as for me,

262
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.500
I'm gonna stand against the current.

263
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.600
I'm going to stand against this flow that's going

264
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.000
towards evil. I'm going to trust Yahweh.

265
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.600
What faith he had, right?

266
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.200
You see Micah's faith in this that he was something

267
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.300
we can imitate here that Micah's Faith was so strong.

268
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.400
Nobody else followed Yahweh.

269
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.200
but he was going to

270
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.300
he didn't need to lean on anyone else. He could

271
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.600
just lean on the Lord, but look at what his faith entailed here.

272
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.300
We need to dig into his faith to understand what that even

273
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.900
means because we throw that word around a lot. What does it mean?

274
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.100
Well first he says I will look to Yahweh.

275
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.000
I will look to Yahweh that word means that he's going to

276
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.400
be on the lookout for the Lord. His eyes are going to go up to the

277
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:56.700
Lord.

278
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.200
That he's going to watch he's going to expect the clouds

279
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.300
of Despair are separating as

280
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.700
this godly man. And and really by the way anybody else who

281
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.900
would trust Yahweh as well. The clouds were breaking

282
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.400
as he was watching for the Lord to

283
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:13.600
act.

284
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.700
So this is waiting. Yes, but not waiting like you're sitting there

285
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.200
on the couch just you know, ticking the time. This is

286
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.600
waiting with expectation.

287
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.500
In verse 4. It's funny. He actually talks about this watching for

288
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.700
judgment that it's coming but now he shifts to

289
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.800
looking for evidence that God was at work.

290
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.200
I will look to the Lord to see what he is

291
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.700
going to do. Listen to this. As soon as we close

292
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.800
our eyes to the working of God as soon

293
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.000
as we stop looking for him to work. That's

294
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.400
when that door of Despair begins to open in

295
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:52.700
our lives.

296
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.500
When we throw in the towel and say forget this God surely isn't

297
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.500
working. That's when the door to

298
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.700
despair opens.

299
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.300
Even if it seems small God is always at work.

300
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.100
By the way, remember there's a lot you can't see behind the

301
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.400
scenes.

302
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.500
That God is always at work. And so he says

303
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.700
I'm going to look to y'all. I'm gonna watch for what

304
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.500
he is going to do and looking to

305
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.300
the Lord but he also says he's going to wait for the god

306
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:28.900
of his salvation.

307
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.800
So he's looking with expectation. He's also waiting. That's that's an

308
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.600
idea that he's saying God's Gonna Act, but

309
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.200
it's in God's time not mine.

310
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.500
I'm expectant that God's gonna do something but it's

311
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.400
his time. Not my time.

312
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.900
It's the same word that.

313
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.400
Psalm 42 verse 11

314
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.600
says as it's repeated it earlier in the psalm

315
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.700
as well. It says why are you cast down? Oh my

316
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.900
soul. Why are you in turmoil within me? Hope

317
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.300
Same word. Hope in God for I shall again

318
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.100
praise him my salvation and my God.

319
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.200
So the picture we get from that word.

320
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.600
Is like imagine an army?

321
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.600
All of them are in one place and they are completely surrounded

322
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.200
by the enemy.

323
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.600
You're like down in this this little Valley area

324
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.300
and the the All Around The Horizon all

325
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.500
they look and they see the enemy.

326
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.900
But that Army knows something.

327
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.000
That Army knows that help is on the

328
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:37.200
way.

329
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.400
That backup is coming.

330
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.400
They don't necessarily know when they just know it is and so

331
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.100
you can imagine so they're in this scene all the

332
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.400
enemies around them and their eyes are looking to the

333
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.200
Horizon, right?

334
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.600
They're just waiting with expectation that that

335
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.300
help is on the way and so you can imagine their heart

336
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.800
turned towards that Horizon and they're

337
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.200
just say come on. Come on. We're in trouble. Come on.

338
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.400
We need you we need and they're they're looking always for

339
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:06.700
that.

340
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.100
That's the idea of waiting.

341
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.200
with hope

342
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.300
with expectation Mike is

343
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.400
doing that. He's calling on God to come deliver him. There's an

344
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.500
air of expectation that things are going to turn around eventually once

345
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.100
he shows up.

346
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.000
He's just got to wait. Everything else is out of control.

347
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.300
Even the people of God are out of control, but Micah had

348
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.300
resolved that Yahweh is fully in control so I

349
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.100
can wait on him.

350
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.200
I can wait on his time. I can wait on his way. I can wait on

351
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.900
Yahweh.

352
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.400
And Micah knew he could have confidence God would act because

353
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.900
he knew God listened to him.

354
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.700
My God will hear me.

355
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.500
Now this was not presumptuous.

356
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.700
Like Micah felt deserving or worthy. It

357
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.300
was not any of that. It was merely a declaration of

358
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.600
the character of God towards his people.

359
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.800
that this is who God is

360
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.200
His heart yes was turned toward Yahweh. So

361
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.500
he knew that God would hear him and respond because the

362
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.300
heart of God is turned towards those whose hearts are turned

363
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:21.600
towards him.

364
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.500
He draws near to those who draw

365
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.600
near to him James 4 says.

366
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.000
So that's what Mike is Faith did.

367
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.500
Right. It was not merely a mental agreement to a

368
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.800
set of facts about God.

369
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.200
His faith his his knowledge of

370
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.500
God's Sovereign activity in the world and his trust that

371
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.600
God would act on his behalf kept him

372
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.800
out of the despair.

373
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.700
that he could have slipped into

374
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.400
He knew that God would eventually deliver him.

375
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.700
He knew that God would eventually deliver anyone else who would

376
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.500
trust in Yahweh. He says God is coming to

377
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.000
deliver us.

378
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.800
And so the question we need to ask today.

379
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.800
Does your faith sustain your soul like

380
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:14.900
that?

381
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.300
again

382
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.700
No matter what you see around you.

383
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.900
No matter how bad it gets no matter what you think things are

384
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.900
headed towards does your faith lead

385
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.700
you to look to the Lord and to

386
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.500
wait for him such that you have. Peace and

387
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.700
hope no matter what

388
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.200
Is that your faith? Do you have that kind of solid hope

389
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.100
and joy that is consistent or

390
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.200
does your soul swing?

391
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.900
Based on who wins the election Tuesday night.

392
00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.500
Or does your soul swing?

393
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.400
In fear because you see these floods over there

394
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.300
and these wars happening over there and you're starting to tie things

395
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.200
together and you're thinking this anxiety is building in

396
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.400
your heart is your soul swinging by that or or whatever else. It is

397
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.400
in your life. And your soul is doing this back and

398
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.000
forth based on conditions.

399
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.000
Remember what Mike is nation was doing it was

400
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.600
breaking apart from the inside and from the outside. It was

401
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.300
watching this thing go completely to Carnage.

402
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.800
This is what Micah's.

403
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.000
Faith led him. I read this somewhere that Micah does not

404
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.600
give up and surrender to despair but he

405
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.300
waits.

406
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.400
Which is the most powerful form of action by the

407
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:44.900
helpless?

408
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.800
Who Express in their waiting the

409
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.500
knowledge that God comes to them in the form of salvation?

410
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.400
So he could have swung to despair or he could have waited

411
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.300
and that in itself was a declaration of

412
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.600
Hope and Faith.

413
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.800
And it was a a war cry

414
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.300
against despair.

415
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.200
The most powerful thing he could have done is not try to

416
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.000
fight the battle himself. He could have

417
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.700
rested

418
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.100
that was his option.

419
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.600
So again, are you looking to the Lord for your salvation?

420
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.600
Yes, eternally, but I'm also talking Deliverance. Right?

421
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.900
Are you walking and and waiting on him with an

422
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.400
expectation for his Deliverance in

423
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.800
his time and in his way?

424
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.500
Or are you trying to fight the battle yourself?

425
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.600
Are you trusting in your own strength?

426
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.600
Are you trying to manipulate the situation that

427
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.900
you face?

428
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:54.800
Are you?

429
00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.700
Are you wandering off from him because he seems like he's delayed

430
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.400
in this situation.

431
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.700
Listen, if you don't wait patiently at that gate.

432
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.000
But you instead wander off down the Concourse to see what

433
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.100
Sharper Image has that you can play it low. If you don't if you don't

434
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.500
wait patient, you might miss your flight.

435
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.700
And you're wandering off because you're trying to find some other way to sustain you

436
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.400
and his delay has ended and he's

437
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:26.500
come.

438
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.600
That's not best for you, right?

439
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.600
You want his deliverance and so imitate his faith.

440
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.600
stand against the current

441
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.900
Be steady in the midst of Great Tribulation that's

442
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.400
coming and turbulence that's coming all around you

443
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.700
and you can you can be steady.

444
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.500
knowing

445
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.800
that your God hears you.

446
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.400
And your God's coming back. Listen it is.

447
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.600
It is easy to believe.

448
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.100
When there's no pressure.

449
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.200
When everything is exactly like you want it

450
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.300
to be it's super simple to be a Christian.

451
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.300
But there is no greater testimony to someone's Faith

452
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.200
than when everything is against you.

453
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.500
When all of life is against you, you're still

454
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.400
trusting in and you're still obeying the God

455
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.300
who hears you.

456
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.900
That's what people need to see.

457
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.200
They don't need to see that everything is just great in your

458
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.100
life. And of course you would believe that of course, you're following God

459
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.100
because he's blessing your life. Look how great your life is, of course.

460
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.000
It's easy for you, but when everything falls apart

461
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.200
When the world is absolutely opposed to everything we

462
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:53.500
believe.

463
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.300
And it gets hard and persecution does come and

464
00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.000
things do start to get a little bit unlike what

465
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.000
we want. That's whenever Faith shows up.

466
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.300
But again, you can only get there hear me you

467
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.800
we can talk about that all day. You can only get there.

468
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.500
if you have that kind of confidence that Micah had

469
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.000
his faith was strong not in just generic Faith

470
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.100
but in something in someone.

471
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.300
And in a trust that he was

472
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.000
going to and you will receive God's salvation. You cannot

473
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.400
have the kind of faith that Micah had unless you

474
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.200
know for certain that his Deliverance his

475
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.200
salvation is coming for you.

476
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.300
When we trust in the Lord by faith that he will deliver.

477
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.800
It will always be on time.

478
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.100
That's what we see next verses 8 through 10 in Micah 7.

479
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.200
Look at it with me.

480
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.600
He just said I will wait. I will look my God

481
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.200
will hear me and then verse 8 Rejoice not

482
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.500
over me my enemy.

483
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.600
When I fall I shall rise when I sit in darkness the

484
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.500
Lord will be a light to me.

485
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.100
I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I've sinned against

486
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.300
him until he pleads my cause and

487
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.300
excuse judgment for me.

488
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.300
He will bring me out to the light. I shall look upon his

489
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.600
Vindication. Then my enemy will see and

490
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.900
shame will cover her who said to me. Where is

491
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.600
the Lord your God?

492
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.200
My eyes will look upon her now. She will be trampled down

493
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.600
like the mire of the streets.

494
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.800
Do you see these reversals?

495
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.400
That God's salvation brings.

496
00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.400
Right. He says I'm gonna fall but I'm

497
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.600
gonna rise in the Lord. I am going to sit

498
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.200
in darkness at times. Yes, but the Lord's going to

499
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.600
be my light. I am going to have to endure God's discipline for

500
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.400
a season because of my sin and my people's sin.

501
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.300
But did you see at the same time? God is also going to be his attorney.

502
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.200
That God's gonna plead his cause God's Gonna execute judgment for

503
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.800
him. God is going to also be the one who frees him.

504
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.400
from the judgment

505
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.500
Here's another reversal. It seemed like the enemy was winning.

506
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.500
Yet in verse 9 Micah said God's going to execute judgment

507
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.000
on his enemies. He's going to vindicate my faith.

508
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.400
Of course, it seems like the enemy's winning now, but in verse 10, we

509
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.200
see the enemy would eventually be shamed and trampled down like

510
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.700
the mud of the streets. That's all judgment language.

511
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.300
That's all saying that there's an end coming to this.

512
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.600
Which Listen by the way, unbeliever?

513
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.300
You're hearing all this and you're like, okay, whatever. I'm just here because my mom

514
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.200
invited me, whatever.

515
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.700
That judgment that he's talking about is coming for you.

516
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.500
But it hasn't come yet, right.

517
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.000
Why not?

518
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.300
Because God has every right to take all of us out. That's just because he's

519
00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.100
holy and we're not he could do that in our sin. Absolutely.

520
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.900
But here's why it hasn't happened yet.

521
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.700
Second Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slow to

522
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.700
fulfill his promise as some count slowness

523
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.500
but is patient towards you not wishing

524
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.200
that any should perish but that all should reach repentance.

525
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.100
See, there's still people.

526
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.500
Who are not Believers yet?

527
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.400
And he's not delayed. He's got a

528
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:37.600
purpose.

529
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.000
It's his mission.

530
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.500
And so if you are an unbeliever and you're hearing this, you have the opportunity yet.

531
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.300
You're not dead yet. You have the opportunity to repent.

532
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.200
Like turn from him turn from your sin turn

533
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.700
to him.

534
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.000
And allow him to change your life.

535
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.600
through repentance and belief

536
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.100
but this question in Micah 7:10.

537
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.100
Where is the Lord your God?

538
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.300
That question and you saw it here that he's using this

539
00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.200
this female feminine language in verse

540
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.400
10 to talk about some figure out there. He's

541
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.400
talking about the Assyrian army.

542
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.500
If you remember the Syrian Army was the ones who were pressing in on Judah at

543
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.400
the time to judge them and eventually take them to Exile. But

544
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.200
for now they were just more of a threat.

545
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.700
But what that Army would do is as they would March through

546
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.100
these opposing Nations. They were very

547
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:39.800
strong military.

548
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.500
As they would March through they would taunt these

549
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.700
other nations Gods along the way and basically

550
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.600
say man, your gods are weak.

551
00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.400
Your Gods can't stand up to us. Look at our chariots. Look

552
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.300
at our forces. We have so many no God

553
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.400
could stand against us.

554
00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.400
What do you think they were saying to Judah?

555
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.500
Where is this Yahweh you're talking about.

556
00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.500
Don't you see how great our army is we're all

557
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.600
around you right now. You have no way out you have no hope where

558
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.500
is the Lord your God?

559
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.500
You talk about them all the time. Where is he you

560
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.700
might as well just give up right now.

561
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.000
But they didn't know Yahweh. Did they?

562
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.300
Yeah, they could say that to this God and that God and this God and that God and

563
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.200
these other nations and they could run over those Nations, but they didn't know

564
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.500
Yahweh because Mike is God was about to show up in

565
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.400
a really big way. In fact, we see it in Second

566
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.200
Kings where he strikes down 185,000 of those

567
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.500
Assyrians in one night.

568
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.600
And the army of Israel a Judah didn't even have to lift a

569
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:45.800
sword.

570
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.400
God just showed up.

571
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.800
And said you're going to taunt me.

572
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.300
Show you that I am the Lord of all creation but

573
00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.500
hear me.

574
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.300
We can look at that and be like, yeah, that's awesome. It's great story. But listen is

575
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.000
that not the same thing the enemy is doing to you today.

576
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:07.900
Where's the Lord your God?

577
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.600
Don't you see what's happening in your life?

578
00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:13.700
Can't you?

579
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.700
Can't you see that God really doesn't love you.

580
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.400
Is he not getting you to try to get you to to

581
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.400
tempt you that you don't need to believe this God that

582
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.000
you're just wasting your time that God's not really real. You can't

583
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.700
see him so surely he's not real or don't you think that he's not

584
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.100
good. Do you really think he has your best

585
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.700
in store? Don't you think that's what the enemy is doing.

586
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.800
And he's not just doing it like in your soul kind of this mind thing people

587
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.500
out there.

588
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.500
He's using to say.

589
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.100
Man this belief in God thing that you're futile. It's

590
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.700
unnecessary. You're just wasting your time.

591
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.300
You get your Sunday mornings back. Why don't you just go to the lake right like

592
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.600
all of these things? You're just wasting your time.

593
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.200
Let's go back to the airport gate. You're sitting there at the gate and you

594
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.500
see the pilot and you see the woman in the yellow vest

595
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.700
with the walkie-talkie and it sure

596
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.800
seems like they're not doing anything.

597
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.100
But they know something you don't know right?

598
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.200
They know that the main Works happening behind the scenes that you can't see.

599
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.400
You don't know what's happening. They're working it out. Even though it might seem

600
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.200
like they're not doing anything. What ultimately matters

601
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.000
is what's happening behind the scenes, right?

602
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.400
You know, we love the story of Daniel.

603
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.700
Daniel with his three friends not bowing down, you know not eating the

604
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.100
King's food those kind of things getting thrown in the fire

605
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.300
furnace all that. It's great great story, but the end of Daniel is actually

606
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.800
really confusing but interesting.

607
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.400
But there's a scene of Daniel 10 where Daniel prays.

608
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.200
In the angel comes three weeks

609
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:52.400
later.

610
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.800
And Daniel Hey, listen, Daniel, we heard your prayer. God

611
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.300
heard your prayer when you prayed it the first time three weeks

612
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.500
ago, but man I was in this battle for three

613
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:04.700
weeks.

614
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.200
I was fighting all of these behind the scenes

615
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.200
these wars spiritually. I was fighting this King and

616
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.600
this King and he's talking spiritual warfare spiritual battles,

617
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.900
and he's like man, I could just get here now three weeks later.

618
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.200
We have no idea what's going on behind the scenes

619
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.700
do we?

620
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.400
Like I've heard John Piper say this that if God just gave

621
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.200
us a little Glimpse behind the curtain spiritually we

622
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.100
would be overwhelmed by what we

623
00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:33.300
see.

624
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.100
That's the reality here.

625
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.800
When you can't see any results.

626
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.100
When it's different that you want different than you

627
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:45.500
want it to be.

628
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.100
And it feels like nothing is happening. You're tempted

629
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.300
to feel that question. Where is God in

630
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.800
this? Here's what you need to do.

631
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.600
You look up and you look back.

632
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.600
You look up to The God Who you know can

633
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.700
do something about the situation who you know hears

634
00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.400
you because you're his by faith You Luke up

635
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.300
to God and you look back at what God has already

636
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:11.600
done.

637
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.300
And you think there's no way God is working right now.

638
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.300
No, you look back to what he's already done that he's proven himself

639
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.200
over and over and over again.

640
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.600
And so you're looking at the situation you're like, okay God. Where where

641
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.200
are you? Where is God in this situation? Oh there

642
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.200
he is on the cross.

643
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.500
Where is God oh, there he is coming out of that tomb alive

644
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.100
on the third day.

645
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.500
Where is God in all of this situation? Oh there

646
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.100
he is ascending back to heaven.

647
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.500
Where is God? Oh, there he is with his people

648
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.300
forever. Where is God? Oh, there he

649
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.400
is coming back one day. Where is God? Oh

650
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.900
various standing in victory over all things. That's where

651
00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.500
God is.

652
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.400
This is how Colossians 2 verse 14 and 15 says

653
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.000
it he says.

654
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.300
This is how God saved us by canceling the record of

655
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.900
debt that stood against us with its legal demands.

656
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.500
This he set aside nailing it

657
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.200
to the cross and he disarmed the

658
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.400
rulers and authorities a spiritual warfare and he

659
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.400
put them to open Shame by triumphing over

660
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.400
them in him.

661
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.800
Set it aside nailing to the Cross. All of this language is Victorious

662
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.500
language, right?

663
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.500
So hear me if you have repented of your sin, and

664
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.300
you have believed in Jesus overcoming work in your place,

665
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.500
then you already stand Victorious over

666
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:43.800
the enemy.

667
00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.500
Not because you earned it not because you're strong

668
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.200
enough, but because Jesus did it for you.

669
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.600
And if you are united to him in faith, you stand

670
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.200
in his victory that enemy that

671
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.900
right now yes is Raging.

672
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.400
But one day we'll be completely annihilated and set

673
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.500
aside just like our sin.

674
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.600
And so don't lose heart friend.

675
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.000
Don't lose heart that though. It might look despairing

676
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.400
and dark right now in the world or

677
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.300
in your heart or in your family. Don't lose hope.

678
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.700
There's always hope.

679
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.500
Because you have hope that the Lord of all the Earth is coming back

680
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.700
one day and he's bringing with him this completed Kingdom.

681
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.500
Where there will be no more sin No More Death no

682
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.200
more Strife. No more emptiness. No more

683
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.000
mistrust. No more murder. No more pain. All

684
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.400
of that will be set aside that's coming back.

685
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.400
And so look to the Lord in that church.

686
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.400
Look to the Lord in whatever you are facing right now.

687
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.800
Wait for the god of your salvation.

688
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.100
Cry out with assurance that he hears you.

689
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.700
That he's never left you alone. It's not that he's absent and

690
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.100
he's coming back one day. He's right in the middle of it with you.

691
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.600
But listen, it might not be according to your schedule, right?

692
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.400
But God has never late.

693
00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.300
He's never early.

694
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.200
And he's never late.

695
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.500
So wait for him trust him.

696
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.000
It might not look like you think it should look.

697
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.700
