00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.360
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.960
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

3
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.560
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth

4
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.600
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

5
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.440
When Christ who is your life appears,

6
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.640
then you will also appear with him in glory.

7
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.890
Well, good morning, church, family. Uh,

8
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.130
we did not anticipate having a family worship gathering today, but, uh,

9
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.790
here we are.

10
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.170
And so I know that brings with it a little trepidation for some of you.

11
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.370
It also brings with it some excitement for some of you and some chaos for some

12
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.970
of you. And so, uh, let's just get this outta the way first. Uh,

13
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.290
if you don't have kids here and you're just here because you're here, hey,

14
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.090
let's pray and let's have a focus that God would work in your life

15
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.410
and all the things that you wanted today and, and needed today,

16
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.050
he'll give that to you. But also encourage those around you,

17
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.420
you who do have kids, right?

18
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.760
And so let's not give the side eye glance at somebody. Let's not do that. Uh,

19
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.280
this is not anything but what they've done for thousands of years in any church

20
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.640
gathering. Okay? Uh, also parents, lemme talk to you for a second. It's okay.

21
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.320
All right, let's, okay. Uh, if your kid makes noise,

22
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.920
your kid needs to get up and walk around and do some things, that's fine. Uh,

23
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.800
we're not against that by any means. And then kids,

24
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.560
let me talk to you for a second. I know you can hang with me, okay?

25
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.080
I've talked to you in kids area a couple times over the years. I've,

26
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.720
I've been with you. We, we can hang together, okay? We can do this. All right?

27
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.370
You can focus.

28
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.320
We're gonna walk through God's word a little bit and I know you can follow

29
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.243
along. Okay?

30
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.400
And so let's all agree that this is gonna be a great morning as it already has

31
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.720
been, as we've seen this as we go. Alright?

32
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.560
So we are going through the book of Colossians,

33
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.160
and in the study we've had so far, we see these,

34
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.320
these structures of letters show up, especially here as an example.

35
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.200
And so there was a introduction of names.

36
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.520
There was a Thanksgiving section today,

37
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.000
as most letters is gonna be a prayer. And so that's the prayer from Paul.

38
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.200
We're gonna study in Colossians, chapter one. So take your copy, God's word,

39
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.000
turn there with me. Colossians chapter one. If you don't have one,

40
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.560
it'll be on the screen or there may be one in this half of the room under the

41
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.680
seats in front of you. We haven't yet got to this side. Sorry, they're on the,

42
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.160
the big, uh, blocks over there if you need one. Uh,

43
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.040
also next week we're gonna pause on Colossians and Labor Day weekend,

44
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.480
jump into Psalms again. Then we'll come back after that two Colossians.

45
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.120
But today we're gonna study what God's word has to say about prayer

46
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.840
and of anything in our faith for, for me included.

47
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.080
This tends to be the one that we are the weakest at most of us struggle with

48
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.680
prayer, how to do it, where we do it, when we do it, all those things.

49
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.560
Most people would say they're not good at prayer.

50
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.400
Why is it so difficult to practice? Why is this the one that is the hardest?

51
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.680
Well, part of the reason is because we stay on the surface with God,

52
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.080
with him theologically, we, we, we really don't understand him deeply.

53
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.280
And so that's where our prayers land.

54
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.800
Just think about how often our prayers,

55
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.080
our petitions deal with things like good health, recovery from illness,

56
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.560
safety on the road as on a test, and so on.

57
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.960
That's kind of where we, we stay up there.

58
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.440
But when you really start to read the Bible,

59
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.200
how many of the prayers recorded in scripture have to do with any of those

60
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.033
things at all?

61
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.080
Like very few actually deal with those kinds of things.

62
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.720
It seems like in our prayer lives, as we look at that, it,

63
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.640
it seems like we've become no different than the pagans that Paul

64
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.160
was writing this letter about to the church in Colossae.

65
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.800
We've become no different than those pagans who were focused solely on physical,

66
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.380
tangible pleasure. Can life be easy?

67
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.620
That's essentially where our prayer lives go. But here's, here's the reality,

68
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.020
here's the point. Kids, if you walk away with nothing else,

69
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.220
here's what I want you to remember. What we pray for is what our priorities are.

70
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.293
Just think about that.

71
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.990
Like what we pray for is what our priorities are

72
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.243
in life.

73
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.070
So when you think about what we pray for is our greatest desire,

74
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.070
our health and wealth and comfort,

75
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.470
is that what we are always praying for?

76
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.070
Or is there more to life?

77
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.710
Is there more to eternity that we should be praying for?

78
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.950
That's why we need this passage today because it's gonna help us answer what

79
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.710
true solid Christ above all prayer would look like.

80
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.430
So let's see how God's word leads us to pray.

81
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.510
Colossians one verses nine through 14 is where we'll be today.

82
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.470
He continues this letter to the Colossians, he says,

83
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.830
and so from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you.

84
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.770
Asking.

85
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.510
You may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and

86
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.270
understanding so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord,

87
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.150
fully pleasing to him,

88
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.470
bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God,

89
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.630
being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for all

90
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.350
endurance and patience with joy giving thanks to the Father who has

91
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.230
qualified you or some manuscripts us to share in the inheritance of the saints

92
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.470
in light, he has delivered us from the domain of darkness,

93
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.830
transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son in whom we have redemption,

94
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.310
the forgiveness of sins. God help us see this.

95
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.390
We need this as it says,

96
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.630
spiritual wisdom and understanding to know what you have for us every age here

97
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:08.550
today to hear something and know about prayer better than we started.

98
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.510
But God, that's your work. This is your fruit to bear in our lives.

99
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.510
Grow us in your will for your glory. In Jesus' name.

100
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.190
Amen. And so if you remember,

101
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.350
Paul had most likely never met these people, these writing to,

102
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.470
and so he'd heard from Eris,

103
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.230
the local that that they had received the gospel,

104
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.990
it bear fruit in their lives. It was increasing.

105
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.870
And so Paul heard that he began praying. The word is constantly now.

106
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.550
Now don't think 24 7, like you have to be always in prayer like that, but,

107
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.990
but think more regularly interceding for them. That's the word we get from this.

108
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.790
Think of the way someone might pray for a wayward child.

109
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:57.080
It's not 24 7, but it is constant, right? It's, it's on your mind.

110
00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.240
It's consistent. It's never giving up. Like in Luke 18,

111
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.080
the widow pounding on the judge's door all night, give me justice.

112
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.000
That's kinda the idea we get here of constant prayer.

113
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.940
But notice for Paul,

114
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.460
the prayer he's talking about is not just when hardship comes, like when,

115
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.740
when we pray, we typically have something bad happen.

116
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.660
And then we pray immediately because of that, he's praying for things.

117
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.620
Notice how he started verse nine. And so,

118
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.900
or maybe your translation for this reason,

119
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.980
he's praying for things he just gave thanks for. He says, guys,

120
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.180
this is what I see in your life. This is exciting to watch God work.

121
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.540
And so I'm praying for those things more and more in your life, right?

122
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.780
He's praying for things that that he's just given thanks for. So it's,

123
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:48.540
it's more of an ongoing prayer, more of a, a thing that he's praying for,

124
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.100
not needs as much as he is for these concerns he has that they would grow in

125
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.300
their faith. That's one of our values here as a church is desperate dependence.

126
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.620
And we're not talking about just whenever we know things are falling apart or

127
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.380
when things are hard.

128
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.980
We're talking about all the time that this is God's work to do, not ours.

129
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.460
So he's saying that for them in their lives,

130
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.380
not just when cancer comes in your life.

131
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.660
Pray constantly for your growth and others' growth as well.

132
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.540
So notice what he says to pray for then if that's what we are to do.

133
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.420
This section's a great example of what we should prioritize and prayer.

134
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.220
'cause what you pray for is what you priorities are.

135
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.660
So first he says you should pray for others' spiritual knowledge.

136
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.260
These are the things he mentions here that,

137
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.140
that he's praying for them that we can model and pray as well.

138
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.620
Spiritual knowledge. By the way,

139
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.020
it might seem like I'm talking a lot about praying for other people here because

140
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.220
that's the way Paul's talking. He's praying for another group of people.

141
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.180
You can pray this stuff for yourself too. Don't think you can't, right? In fact,

142
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.013
you probably should.

143
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.980
But here's the question I want to ask you before we get into this.

144
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.900
Are you even praying for other people

145
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.300
or are your prayers only self-focused? It's all about you.

146
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:09.300
Let's make sure and and follow Paul's example here and pray for others as well.

147
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.700
Your brothers and sisters in Christ that you're praying for their spiritual

148
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.260
growth as we see Paul do here.

149
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.180
But look again, verse nine. He says,

150
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:24.100
he's asking that they may be filled with the knowledge of God's will and all

151
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.940
spiritual wisdom and understanding. And so Paul's praying for them.

152
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.700
We ought to pray for others to grow in their mental capacity,

153
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.660
to understand who God is and what He's done

154
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.000
that like it says in Ephesians chapter three,

155
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.120
that they may have strength to comprehend with all the saints,

156
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.840
what is the bra breadth and length and height and depth and to know the

157
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.000
love of Christ that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled with all the

158
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.040
fullness of God. Remember, what was the context?

159
00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.920
The Colossian Christians were constantly faced with the noise of

160
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.920
false religions all around them of other ways to get to

161
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.200
a God. This person was saying this, this and others saying this over here.

162
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.880
Or they were hearing this and this or ways to be satisfied in life.

163
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.000
They're hearing all of these things around them.

164
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.040
And so they needed to know what Yahweh, God Almighty said.

165
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.840
They needed to know what he said about them, what he said about life,

166
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.080
what he said about truth and faith.

167
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.480
They needed to lean into what's Paul writes in one Corinthians two,

168
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.880
this mind of Christ,

169
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:41.000
they needed to lean into that so they can know and discern what is of God,

170
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.520
what's not of God, what to do about it. Listen,

171
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.440
it is no different for us today, right?

172
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.840
Your Facebook feed, your TikTok feed, C n N, Fox News,

173
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.560
they're all presenting a lot of information to you.

174
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.080
And it's not all true. It's not all true.

175
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.880
It's constantly putting in front of you information,

176
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.480
getting you to focus on this or focus on that.

177
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.600
And you and I need the Holy Spirit's wisdom to know what's truth and what's not.

178
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.250
The Colossians, we're getting it. We're getting it as well.

179
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.530
And so we ought to be praying that God grows our minds,

180
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.490
that we can be aware and understand His will.

181
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.810
Understand how he wants us to live. As Romans 12,

182
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.970
two says, do not be conformed to this world,

183
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.970
but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.

184
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.970
That by testing you may discern what is the will of God.

185
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.050
What is good and acceptable and perfect?

186
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.340
Are you praying that for anyone else?

187
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.540
Are you praying those words for yourself at all?

188
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.860
Listen, I look around and I know in my life and our lives,

189
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.460
there's a famine of spiritual understanding in our world right now.

190
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.940
And so we need to un on our faces,

191
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:13.060
pray that God would bring spiritual understanding to our lives so we can know

192
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.893
what to do.

193
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.860
We must not cease praying for things like that.

194
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.180
But Paul also understood this like the rest of the New Testament also

195
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.620
understands this. That our faith is not merely intellectual.

196
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.260
It's not just that we know that we understand,

197
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.780
it does involve our minds, but it's intended to lead us to something.

198
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.180
This is Colossians one, verse 10.

199
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.740
It says So as,

200
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.620
so he just talked about praying for knowledge and spiritual understanding so as

201
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.440
to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord fully pleasing to him,

202
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:54.963
right? You see that

203
00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.720
the reason Paul was praying for their minds to grow was so that their life would

204
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.553
change.

205
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.520
Not just that they would go puffed up like kinda megamind growing your brain

206
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.480
more and more. Like that's not what he's talking about.

207
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.560
He's talking about so that your life would change,

208
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.280
you know more so you can do more Knowledge leads to action.

209
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.200
We ought to pray for others wise life, application of the wisdom of God.

210
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.970
This word, he says, walk here, your walk.

211
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.290
This word is used all over scripture to refer to the way we live as we follow

212
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.410
the Lord. I actually had a, in the first church I started,

213
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.490
I had a new believer get confused by that word. I asked him,

214
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.410
I didn't even think about it 'cause I'm just kind of in the culture. I like,

215
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:46.290
how's your walk doing? He's like, uh, like bouncy, I guess.

216
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.450
I don't know. And I dunno, I limp a little bit. He had no idea.

217
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.090
It's talking about your faith. It's talking about the way you live your life,

218
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.930
that the word walk is referring to the way you live in

219
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.010
light of God's work in your life, how you're following him.

220
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:06.650
And so we see here we are to walk in a manner worthy

221
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.490
of the Lord. And that worthy of the Lord is,

222
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:15.440
is what is pleasing to the Lord. Now, wait a second here.

223
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.520
Kids, you might have even picked this up. Like if we're supposed to please God,

224
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.280
does that mean that we can earn God's love in some way?

225
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:31.080
Good answer said no. No.

226
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.440
This has nothing to do with salvation.

227
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.360
This has nothing to do with good works that would earn God's love.

228
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.880
It's kind of like with your kids parents when,

229
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.160
when you're thinking about how you will love your children unconditionally

230
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.440
forever, no questions asked. Like that's just the way it is.

231
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.000
You're modeling God's love for you to your kids. Nothing will ever change that.

232
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.800
That is what we are about. But when you watch one of them serve,

233
00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.920
when you hear of the way that they treat their teachers at school really

234
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.480
positively when they're writing notes to someone that's an encouraging note or

235
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:10.600
or they're resisting a sin very clearly and you hear of that or you watch

236
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.440
them do that, man, that just lifts your spirit as a parent, doesn't it?

237
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.680
Like it makes you proud, it pleases you.

238
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.900
So it doesn't change your love,

239
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.660
but it it pleases you in the way you respond to them.

240
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.630
And so that's what he's talking about here. And so we need to know, okay,

241
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.790
what does a life that pleases the Lord look like?

242
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.110
If that's what we're called to, what does it look like?

243
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.430
What does the sorts of things we can be praying for in others' lives,

244
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.910
in our own lives? Well,

245
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:47.830
he gives a series here of three les that describe a life that pleases

246
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:48.683
the Lord.

247
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:55.160
The first one he says is that we should pray that fruit would be produced in

248
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.080
someone's life, A life that pleases.

249
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.960
God is a life that bears fruit in every good work. Verse 10 says,

250
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.970
we already saw last week in verse six that that's what this gospel word of hope

251
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.930
does. When it takes root in someone's life, it increasingly bears fruit.

252
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.730
It produces something when the gospel changes you.

253
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.580
And so the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,

254
00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.700
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Galatians five says,

255
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.700
that's fruit of the spirit working in you. Yes, but notice here,

256
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.900
Paul ties it to every good work,

257
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.500
bearing fruit in every good work. Not good works that could save you,

258
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.940
but responsive works that please God

259
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.350
Generous

260
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.620
Works that he is designed for us to fulfill,

261
00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:53.540
which is actually what Ephesians two 10 says, that we are his workmanship,

262
00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.820
his masterpiece, his creation,

263
00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.180
created in Christ Jesus for good works,

264
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:06.140
which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them,

265
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.600
Right? Not for salvation, it's in response to salvation.

266
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.200
These good works come up.

267
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.480
And you remember we studied this back in the winter in Titus,

268
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:22.240
that Titus two says that God's grace trains us to be

269
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.680
zealous for good works.

270
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.600
That something in us as God plants his gospel,

271
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:32.600
changes our hearts to want to do things that Titus two and three says that we

272
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.240
should turn from sin. We should live self-controlled,

273
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.520
godly lives in our thoughts, in our actions.

274
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.400
We should submit to authorities speak evil of no one.

275
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.800
Avoid quarreling, be gentle. Respect all people, not gossip.

276
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:48.600
Don't stir up division.

277
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.000
That's what Titus two and three says is a life that pleases God,

278
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.720
a life that is full of good works. Those kinds of things.

279
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.560
It's what Jesus said, John 15, if you obey his commandments,

280
00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:08.400
you will abide in his love when you abide in Jesus.

281
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.560
That's what he says later that that's where good fruit comes.

282
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.640
If you abide in me, you'll produce fruit.

283
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.440
So abiding comes through obedience to his commands. That's the good works,

284
00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:25.040
which then in turn produces fruits through our lives.

285
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.520
So you think about how do I obey what? What am I supposed to obey?

286
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.320
It's God's command. So think about if you would love an enemy,

287
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.840
The fruit that comes from that of course changes you.

288
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.840
But it could also change that person's heart.

289
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.160
And their heart is softened to something that you couldn't do on your own.

290
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.280
You obey God's command to give sacrificially to a needy brother and

291
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.120
sister around you in the church they're provided for. That's the fruit, right?

292
00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.180
You.

293
00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.760
You think about showing mercy to a stranger in this room that you don't know,

294
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.600
but they're sitting by themselves and you can tell something as you're seeing

295
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.440
with God's eyes and you show mercy to them as God commanded they are

296
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.920
what? The fruit is there welcomed and loved by that.

297
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.440
And you could go on and on and on. As we obey God's word.

298
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.480
He produces fruit through us.

299
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.800
So are you praying that yourself and others around you would bear more

300
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.080
fruit? Are you asking God for it?

301
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.840
Are you positioning yourself to abide in him better so that you produce more

302
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.760
fruit as God does it through you?

303
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.080
Those are ways to pray.

304
00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:46.320
That's not all though a life that pleases the Lord is that it bears

305
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.920
fruit. Verse 10, yes. But also that it grows in the knowledge of God.

306
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.560
A life that pleases the Lord is one that grows in the knowledge of God,

307
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.000
that their in their knowledge will be increased.

308
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.280
We've already talked a lot about this, but see this

309
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.280
scripture is very clear that growing in the depth of your understanding is

310
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.440
part of a life that pleases God.

311
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:19.150
I know firsthand how easy it is to get complacent and to get

312
00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.190
lazy in your pursuit of the Lord.

313
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.190
I know how easy it is to slip into this reality that if you've been in church

314
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.830
for a long time, that you think you know everything already

315
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.750
and you can think and feel like I don't need to grow.

316
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:35.950
I don't need anything else.

317
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.150
How wrong a perspective though?

318
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.920
But listen, here's the reality I found in varieties of ways in my life.

319
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.520
God won't let you stay there. You start to think,

320
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.160
I've got it all figured out. I know this. I don't need what they're offering.

321
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.000
I don't need the word. I don't need to pray. I don't need the basics anymore.

322
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.600
He won't let you stay there.

323
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:10.680
He'll take you to a place of brokenness or to

324
00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.080
a wilderness season in life

325
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:13.800
Where

326
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.880
You're gonna have to learn some things.

327
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.000
And why does he do that? Because he's good. Yeah,

328
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.200
because he's good and he's good because he wants more of you.

329
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.320
He wants more of you.

330
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.880
He wants more of your heart and he wants to reveal more of himself to you,

331
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.600
more of his nature, more of his character,

332
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.640
and in ways that you can only learn through the wilderness season.

333
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.800
So he's good to you to take you through that when you were over here kind of

334
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.520
righteously thinking, I've got it all together.

335
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.320
He takes you through some brokenness so you learn more about him.

336
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:52.930
'cause here's the reality,

337
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.960
we're always in learning mode with God because he's infinite.

338
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.960
And we're not even when we get to heaven forever, we'll be in learn mode.

339
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.160
'cause we won't be able to know anything more.

340
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.120
Like we can't know everything about God. He's God, we're not.

341
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.240
So that's where we can always grow in this kind of knowledge.

342
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.720
Pray for others towards that end.

343
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.480
Pray for yourself even help other,

344
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.360
we talk a lot about disciple making around here.

345
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.200
That's what we're talking about.

346
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.000
Just help others grow in their knowledge and understanding and application of

347
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.840
God. That's it.

348
00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:32.280
Just help 'em know and help 'em grow in that and pray for your own faith as

349
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.080
well. So that's two.

350
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.600
There's a third here that describes a God pleasing life.

351
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.720
It's in verse 11,

352
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:47.440
being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for

353
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.920
all endurance and patience with joy.

354
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.360
So here's what we need to pray for.

355
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:59.760
Pray with Paul that endurance would be provided by God.

356
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.240
Pray that endurance is provided.

357
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.720
There's so much in this verse really,

358
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.760
but I tried to boil it down to that one word endurance because I think it

359
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.560
encompasses the rest of the verse. That in order to endure

360
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:24.400
Through false religions pressing on you in colossae or

361
00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.160
to endure through pain and suffering in life,

362
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.800
or to endure through temptations that would come constantly in your life,

363
00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.920
how do you endure? You need these things.

364
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.840
This verse talks about you need to be strengthened by the Lord's dynamic

365
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.123
power.

366
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.860
That's a power that's not just kind of strength and and muscles.

367
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.820
It's a power according to God's miracle working might,

368
00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.180
that God can only do certain things we can't do.

369
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.260
That's his power and might working in us.

370
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.940
Yet you'll also need patience to endure what you face because so much of life is

371
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.340
not resolved in an instant. You gotta have some patience to walk through this,

372
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.540
yet you're to endure with joy.

373
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.420
It says that even through the tears and the aches, you see something better.

374
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.020
You see something out there that's a future and a hope.

375
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.620
That's why all of this goes together. It ties together. Endurance is the word,

376
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.820
but you need strength and power and you need patience.

377
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.740
You need joy all together as endurance.

378
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.970
But when you and I think of our prayer lives,

379
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.890
this is one major way that deviates from what God's word has just said,

380
00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:48.120
Because we so frequently pray that God would

381
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.000
remove someone from the pain, from the situation,

382
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.240
from the persecution, whatever,

383
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.400
like we want God to take it all away.

384
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.750
But are we ever praying for endurance

385
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.380
for that person as they walk through whatever it is are.

386
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.060
Are we praying for God's strength, for God's power to work? Are we,

387
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.500
are we praying that they would show joy through the pain?

388
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:28.730
Or are we only praying like the pagans in Colossae

389
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.370
that life would be easy for 'em, that life would be easy for us?

390
00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:41.490
Listen to how James chapter one verse 12 writes, it says,

391
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.850
blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial

392
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.210
for when he has stood the test. He will receive the crown of life,

393
00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.610
which God has promised to those who love him.

394
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.050
Just a few verses earlier,

395
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:02.090
he wrote that we should count it as joy when we face trials because that

396
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:06.210
joy brings about endurance and that endurance leads to that

397
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.610
steadfastness that brings the crown of life.

398
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.690
And so we should not see it as a problem when we face trials.

399
00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.730
We should see it as as a blessing. James says,

400
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.500
because then you get endurance that you never could get any way else

401
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.500
If and only if

402
00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.700
you lean on God's strength through the trial.

403
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.730
So let's pray a little bit differently, right? Let, let's pray.

404
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.090
Yes, for healing, for protection, for needs to be met.

405
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.490
God's word commands us to pray for those things.

406
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.050
We're not saying it's wrong to pray for those things,

407
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.010
but let's pray with this kind of perspective

408
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.920
as well as we pray for, for healing,

409
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.880
let's pray for joy and endurance and strength through it.

410
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.960
That's what God's word says to pray for.

411
00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.360
But if you remember this passage, if I, as I read it earlier,

412
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.080
you remember now that that we're not through with his prayer yet, right?

413
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:19.920
We haven't hit all of it because in verse 12,

414
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.720
there's a shift he makes where he begins to include himself in the

415
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.553
prayer.

416
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.750
He starts using us instead of just you,

417
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.790
you Colossians, here's what I'm praying for you.

418
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.510
But then he shifts to this us mentality and he does that because his prayer

419
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.280
turns into a beautiful explanation of eternal salvation.

420
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:47.680
Like this is what his mind shifts to where he starts to include himself

421
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.960
because he's included in that as salvation as well. He says, no,

422
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.120
this is where we have been included.

423
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.280
And he can't help but praise God.

424
00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.040
Even as he's speaking these words to whoever's writing him down, he's saying,

425
00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.280
here's what I can't get over

426
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:07.000
This reality of salvation. I mean,

427
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.400
just look at how the work of God spills out of his mouth.

428
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.000
Do. Do you pray like this?

429
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.440
Like do you see what we're gonna see here in a second? Do you pray like this?

430
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.720
Are these kinds of things in your prayers at all?

431
00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.120
Is it only I need this, I need this, I need this. Do this God do this,

432
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.720
God are this, these kinds of things in there.

433
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.930
First in verse 12, he says,

434
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:36.290
we ought to praise the Father because he's provided an inheritance for us

435
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.330
that God has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in

436
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:43.880
light.

437
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.810
What that word qualified means is that he's made us sufficient to receive it.

438
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.130
We couldn't before,

439
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:54.490
but now he's made us sufficient by including us in his family,

440
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.570
by faith. Okay, what's the inheritance we're waiting for?

441
00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.810
What is this that he's talking about?

442
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.970
It's what we saw in verse five that he's laid up this hope in heaven for

443
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:04.803
us.

444
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.050
That's the inheritance that someday we're gonna be with Jesus forever.

445
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.330
That treasure that we've been waiting on,

446
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.410
that he's waiting for the reunion to come.

447
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.490
We're gonna be with the saints in light.

448
00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.370
We're gonna be in the light of Jesus forever.

449
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:22.290
That's the inheritance He's talking about Like what a gift, right?

450
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.250
What a gift that that. This is the absolute.

451
00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.090
I know you've maybe got some good gifts in life.

452
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.290
You're waiting on inheritance from a family member. Whatever it is,

453
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.170
this is by far the best inheritance you could ever imagine made even

454
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.050
better because you don't deserve it.

455
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:42.690
And he's adopted you into his family. He's chosen you. You are his beloved,

456
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:46.650
simply because he loves you and pulled you in and said your mind.

457
00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.450
Praise God for that, right?

458
00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:54.870
And praise the Father that he's also delivered us from darkness. Paul says,

459
00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.910
he's not only given us this inheritance that we wait for,

460
00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.950
he's delivered us from darkness.

461
00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.750
It's all about eternal salvation, right?

462
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:08.270
This is the new exodus that God accomplished in salvation where he delivered us

463
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:09.430
out of slavery.

464
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.430
The location we came from is this darkness.

465
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:17.470
And that idea is used all over scripture to refer to where we are when we're

466
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.990
still lost. Darkness is where we are when we're still in our sin,

467
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.870
when we're in the domain of the enemy,

468
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:27.910
when we're owned and controlled by our sin, nature, by the enemy himself.

469
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:29.670
That's the darkness.

470
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.720
It's what Ephesians six 12 says, this present darkness.

471
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.720
And it refers to a spiritual world directed by rulers, authorities,

472
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.160
powers and forces of evil.

473
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.680
That is the darkness that we see creep into the world around us.

474
00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.200
And it's the darkness that you and I live in, in our sin.

475
00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.113
Yet

476
00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:58.260
believers can look at all of that and we can praise the Lord because

477
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.580
in Christ, he has delivered us.

478
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.740
He has rescued us from the chains of that dark prison cell and we're not

479
00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:09.820
there anymore. Like listen, the the, you remember one Peter two, nine,

480
00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.300
this has been years ago. We talked about this in the judges series.

481
00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.700
One Peter two, nine says, you are a chosen race. This is why we should worship.

482
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.460
You're a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,

483
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.540
a people for his own possession,

484
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:27.580
that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness

485
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:28.740
into his marvelous light,

486
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:34.020
that he's taken us out of that and made us completely

487
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.860
new. That's why we worship.

488
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.150
Listen, if you've repented and believed in Jesus,

489
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:46.550
you are not in darkness anymore, but you are in the light of Christ.

490
00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.990
Remember who you are, Christian man.

491
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.150
The enemy wants to toss that in you really quickly. No, no. That's who you are.

492
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.470
You are your past. You are what you used to do.

493
00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.470
You are who you still get tempted by. Like that's who you are. No, no, no, no.

494
00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.630
You're not in darkness anymore. He's delivered you from the domain of darkness.

495
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.590
You are in the light of Christ. Now, that should spark worship and response

496
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:16.470
And it should lead us to walk as children of light,

497
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.110
a life that pleases God,

498
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:23.950
a life that is in light now.

499
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.350
But not only has God delivered us out of something, as good as that is,

500
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.270
he's delivered us into something as well. Let me read these verses again,

501
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:36.550
verses 13 and 14. 'cause it shows it.

502
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:41.390
He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us

503
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:46.030
to the kingdom of his beloved son in whom we have redemption,

504
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:48.630
the forgiveness of sins.

505
00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:53.270
So he's delivered us out of the domain of darkness and he's transferred us into

506
00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:57.110
the kingdom, his kingdom of of his son,

507
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.270
the redeemed kingdom, the new kingdom.

508
00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.150
He's taken us out and put us in.

509
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.680
He's made a way for us to be part of his kingdom.

510
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.720
This new redeemed humanity that is forever and ever. That starts today.

511
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.440
It's not even finished yet, but it one day will be

512
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.400
like these verses. Just think about this. There's a reason I read those. Again,

513
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:22.280
these verses are the core of salvation, aren't they?

514
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:24.460
That

515
00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:29.260
Our sins are forgiven through the shed blood of Jesus as our sacrifice.

516
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.940
That he's our substitute that is at the core.

517
00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:36.580
That God paid a ransom of his son's life to free

518
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.280
enslaved sinners like you and me.

519
00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:44.200
And because we could never earn our way out of it, he had to do it.

520
00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.000
And simply because he loves he did it.

521
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:52.080
The redemption that redeemed is freeing from slavery to something else.

522
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.320
It's what Jesus did.

523
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.280
That's the essence of the gospel church,

524
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.340
and it's one primary reason we ought to lift up our voices and praise in here.

525
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.860
And it's why we ought to lift up our lives in pleasing God out there

526
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.740
because of what he's done.

527
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.260
But notice it should also change the way you pray as well.

528
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.050
Do you recount the gospel like that in your prayers?

529
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:35.330
And do you consider and base all your requests

530
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.890
on the sovereign good hand of God who's done this?

531
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:46.630
Listen, maybe you don't know how to do that. That's okay.

532
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.070
You've never been shown how you've never been trained,

533
00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:53.790
how there's tons of resources we could point you to to help you pray in this

534
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:54.870
kind of way. Just come ask.

535
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:58.550
That's all we'd we'd be able to do is just point you to some good resources.

536
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.590
But even better than that, here's another encouragement.

537
00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.070
Get around somebody who does pray like that and just pray with them.

538
00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.950
Like think about how did Timothy learn how to pray?

539
00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:14.190
He would just with Paul all the time, Paul's praying like this.

540
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.590
So how did Timothy learn how to pray just like this?

541
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.900
So get around someone who knows how to pray and just listen and learn

542
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:29.300
and grow in your own ability to pray these kinds of things, as Paul does.
