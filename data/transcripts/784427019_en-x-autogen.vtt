's the Angels pray.

32
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.800
Mary Joseph and the

33
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.400
land why?

34
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:01.600
this morning

35
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.200
I woke up the sunrise was beautiful this morning

36
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.900
if anyone was up to see it and I was reflecting

37
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.200
this morning on what this day means Christmas

38
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.800
Eve.

39
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.100
So that word eve it means we're on the brink of

40
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.200
something. We're waiting for something when the eve

41
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.300
of something and we're waiting for

42
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.100
Is the celebration of tomorrow that we are celebrating?

43
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.300
Jesus Christ Our Savior our King

44
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.900
the Messiah has come he's come

45
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.400
to this Earth as a baby.

46
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.100
Save us to be our savior.

47
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.800
And so the afternoon You're Here Waiting for

48
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.000
Tomorrow waiting to celebrate. I want

49
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.500
you to know the reason why he came.

50
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.600
Is where there is death.

51
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.000
He came to bring life eternal life.

52
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.300
Where there's pain he came to bring healing.

53
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.400
Where there's despair he came to bring hope

54
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.700
hope to your heart.

55
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.400
Where there's light he came to I'm sorry

56
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.200
where he's where there's Darkness. He came to push back

57
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.200
that Darkness to bring the light.

58
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.600
So I couldn't think of a better verse to read right now than John

59
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.800
1:1 through 5 and it talks about Jesus Christ the

60
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.500
word coming to be the light for

61
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.000
us. So let's read this together.

62
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.900
Says this in the beginning was the word.

63
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.900
The word was with God and the Word was God.

64
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.500
He was in the beginning with God.

65
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.100
All things were made through him.

66
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.400
And without him was not anything made that was

67
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:46.700
made.

68
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.600
And him was life and the life was the light of

69
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.100
men.

70
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.100
the light shines in the Darkness

71
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.600
and the Darkness has not overcome it.

72
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.900
best you've heaven

73
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.100
brilliant like this stars and the

74
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.800
wintery sky

75
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.300
joy of the father.

76
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.900
reach through the

77
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.100
dark shine across the

78
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:24.600
Earth

79
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.300
tragedies

80
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.400

104
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.900
At this time in the service, we're gonna invite our

105
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.300

Let me see your eyes.

What all of you you look so great.

116
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.600
Are you ready for Christmas?

117
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.800
Yes, so good to see you. We

118
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.400
have some more friends coming but as

119
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.300
they're coming I'm gonna ask something some of

120
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.300
you are so excited that I'm gonna have to ask you

121
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:13.700
to

122
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.700
take a deep breath with me.

123
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:18.700
Let it out.

124
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.300
Because I need you to be a good listener because

125
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.300
there's so many people even back there too who might

126
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.800
not be able to see and hear. So I need you up here, especially to

127
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.900
be great listeners Okay, so

128
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.600
I am super excited that it's Christmas, and I know

129
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.400
you are too.

130
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.200
and so

131
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.600
I think Christmas is amazing because

132
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.600
it's one of the times that we stop and

133
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.800
remember something astounding Benjamin

134
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.100
you want to stay here by me? Okay. Can you

135
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.700
all say astounding?

136
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.400
Yes, so this astounding thing

137
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.900
that we remember at Christmas is that God

138
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.400
came to Earth as a

139
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.100
baby and I have a story about that that I'm going

140
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.300
to tell you, but before I do.

141
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.300
I want to say something about waiting.

142
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.700
So have you ever had to wait for

143
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.300
a long time for something? Not your heads if you think you've

144
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.600
had to wait for things? Yeah, and so I was

145
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.300
thinking waiting for chocolate chip cookies

146
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.400
to finish baking has to be one of the hardest things

147
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.500
right? You could smell them you're ready

148
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.400
for them. But you just have to wait. They're not as good until they're

149
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:34.900
ready.

150
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.500
Or what about when you're getting ready to go on

151
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.500
a trip and you're really excited about where you're

152
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.400
going the countdown is on but you have

153
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.300
to wait, right? And then the other thing

154
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.000
I was thinking about especially and this one kind of

155
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.400
talked about it. I think tonight you are probably all waiting,

156
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.400
aren't you? You're probably really

157
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.400
excited about something that is

158
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.800
happening tomorrow morning. You're probably opening presents, right?

159
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.400
So all these things we have to wait

160
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.800
for just a minute. So when we

161
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.500
have to wait it's because we know

162
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.600
something great is going to happen that we

163
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.500
can wait expectantly and happily and

164
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:17.800
you know what,

165
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.400
Almost from the beginning of time God's people

166
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.500
were waiting. They were waiting for

167
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.500
this most important thing to happen. And that's

168
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.300
the story I'm going to tell you about. This is a book that many

169
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.300
of you probably have at home. You can nod your heads if you have a Jesus

170
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.000
storybook Bible. All right, good deal. Well, if

171
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.300
you can't see the pages, you can look up on the screen

172
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.700
and there there you will see the pictures. Okay. So here

173
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.200
we go. He's here. Everything was

174
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.500
ready.

175
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.500
The moment God had been waiting for was here at last

176
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.400
God was coming to help his people

177
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.100
just as he promised in the beginning, but

178
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.300
how would he come? What would

179
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.700
he be? Like, what would he do?

180
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.300
Mountains would have bound down Seas would

181
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.700
have roared trees would have clapped their hands.

182
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.200
The Earth held its breath.

183
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.800
As silent as snow falling he came in and

184
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.700
when no one was looking in the darkness

185
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.600
he came.

186
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.300
There was a young girl who was engaged to a

187
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.600
man named Joseph was the great great

188
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.500
great. Great. Great. Great grandson of

189
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.700
King David one morning. This girl was minding

190
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.400
her own business when suddenly a great

191
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.800
warrior of light appeared right there in

192
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.400
her bedroom. He was Gabriel and he

193
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.400
was an angel a special messenger from

194
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:44.800
heaven.

195
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.600
When she saw the tall shiny man standing there.

196
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.000
Mary was frightened.

197
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.800
I don't need to be scared Gabriel said God

198
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.400
is very happy with you.

199
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.300
Mary looked around to see perhaps he was talking to someone else

200
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.600
Mary Gabriel said and

201
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.400
he laughed with such gladness that Mary's eyes

202
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.100
filled with sudden tears Mary. You're

203
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.700
going to have a baby a

204
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.600
little boy. You will call

205
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.700
him Jesus. He is God's own

206
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.000
son. He's the one he's The

207
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.400
Rescuer The God Who flung

208
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.600
planets into space and kept them whirling around

209
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.100
and around the God made the universe with

210
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.600
just a word the one who could do anything at all

211
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.800
was making himself small and

212
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.100
coming down as a baby.

213
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.400
Wait, God was sending a

214
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.300
baby to rescue the world.

215
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.500
But it's too wonderful. Mary said

216
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.400
and felt her heart beating hard. How can

217
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.200
it be true? Is anything too wonderful

218
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.500
for God Gabriel asked. So Mary

219
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.700
trusted God more than her eyes could see and

220
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.700
she believed.

221
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.200
I am God's servant. She said whatever. God

222
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.200
says I will do.

223
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.600
Sure enough. It was just as the angel had

224
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.700
said nine months later. Mary was

225
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.100
almost ready to have her baby now Mary

226
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.600
and Joseph had to take a trip to Bethlehem.

227
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.800
The town King David was from but

228
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.800
when they reached the little town they found every

229
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.600
room was full. Every bed

230
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.700
was taken go away. The innkeepers

231
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.200
told them there isn't any place for you? Where would

232
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.800
they stay?

233
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.200
Soon marries baby would come they couldn't

234
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.300
find anywhere except an old tumble down

235
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.500
stable. So they stayed where the cows and

236
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.100
the donkeys and the horses stayed.

237
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.700
And there in the stable amongst the

238
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.100
chickens and the donkeys and the

239
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.400
cows in the quiet of the night. God gave the

240
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.700
world his wonderful gift the baby that

241
00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.900
would change the world was born his baby

242
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.500
son. Mary and Joseph wrapped him

243
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.100
up to keep him warm. They made a soft bed of straw

244
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.300
and use the animals feeding trophies his cradle and they

245
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.100
gazed in Wonder at God's great gift wrapped

246
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.100
in swaddling clothes and lying in a Manger

247
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.500
Mary and Joseph named him Jesus Emmanuel, which

248
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.300
means God has come to live

249
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.300
with us because of course he had

250
00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.100
So Jesus was born God had come to

251
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.300
Earth Emmanuel God With Us.

252
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.700
Will you pray with me?

253
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.300
Father thank you so much for Jesus. Thank

254
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.400

Let me again welcome you to Christmas Eve at Henderson Hills

347
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.500
one of my favorite nights of the year. Not just because it's

348
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.200
so beautiful and lots of smiles and fun and all of

349
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.900
the anticipation of what's coming later and tomorrow, but because

350
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.200
around here, we don't really just lean on

351
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.800
the cinematality of Christmas. We make it a worship Gathering.

352
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.300
That's what this is tonight. Hopefully you've already seen that

353
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.100
felt that it will be the rest of tonight as well.

354
00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.500
If I haven't met you yet. My name is John lead teaching Pastor

355
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.800
here, which basically means I preach most of the time and so

356
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.200
if I haven't met you, please come say hello to me. I'd love

357
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.300
to meet you. There's also maybe more simple way

358
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.500
QR code in the seat back in front of you to just let

359
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.200
us know you're here. There's nothing that we're gonna spam you

360
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.100

361
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.500

362
00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.400
family as well. We would love to get a record of even

363
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.300
from out of state just to say thank you for being here with us. We we

364
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.100
do ask for your email on there. So I

365
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.100
thought it's only fair for you to get here my email. So John W.

366
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.400

367
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.400
us yours because I'll give you mine. No worries about that. Now if

368
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.900
you're new to our church, you might be wondering what this whole thing is about Advent and

369
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.100
why we have candles up here all of that.

370
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.900
We've been walking through this season referred to as Advent. That word

371
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.800
is is a Latin root word. That means coming

372
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.200
or appearing and so what this

373
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.700
is is a celebration of the appearing of the Messiah

374
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.400
that we know as Jesus now, but but

375
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.600
back in the Old Testament, they were just looking forward to someone they

376
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.500
didn't know who it was and so, we now know it's Jesus but in some

377
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.800
way we're all so relating to their Waiting by our

378
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.700
waiting for his second Advent when

379
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.000
he returns and so we've got a sense of

380
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:51.800
waiting as well.

381
00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.500
What traditionally has been used to Mark these weeks leading

382
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.400
up to Christmas is an Advent wreath of this or

383
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.400
some other form usually has candles that

384
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.500
are lighted weekly as you can see, we've already been through four weeks

385
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.300
each Candle on the outside symbolizes the

386
00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.600
need we have in our hearts.

387
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.100
For the the longing of our hearts to

388
00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.500
be fulfilled for for Hope for peace

389
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.700
for Joy for love.

390
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.400
And how that that Jesus is the only source for all

391
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.000
of those things that we have needs in our hearts.

392
00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.600
Well, there's one more candle. Of course. That's the final candle in the middle and it

393
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.100
symbolizes what Jesus said about

394
00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.900
himself in John 8:12 that he is the light

395
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:35.600
of the world.

396
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.600
That he brings the light of life.

397
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.700
You heard it earlier, Joe read it John 1:4 that

398
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.200
in him was life. And that life was the light of men

399
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.600
the light shines in the darkness. The darkness has not overcome

400
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:49.800
it.

401
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.700
This is a fulfillment of what Isaiah even prophesied 700 years

402
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.300
before Jesus was born that the the people

403
00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.000
who walked in darkness have seen a great light.

404
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.000
This is what we're pointing to here that this is

405
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.400
the light of Life found in Jesus.

406
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.300
Yet even as we come to this one tonight.

407
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.700
Where we'll light this final candle celebrating Jesus bringing light.

408
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.700
The reality is that many of us.

409
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.400
Don't feel that life that God's

410
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.200
word talks about.

411
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.900
Like you might have walked in here feeling pretty empty.

412
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.100
You walk around in this supposedly joy-filled time

413
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.200
of the year and and you're just

414
00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:36.600
not there.

415
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.400
You don't have that Instagram worthy kind of life that everybody

416
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.100
else posts about because yours is just not there.

417
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.300
Even singing the lines from that song. We just sang.

418
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.000
Oh Come All Ye Faithful joyful and triumphant what

419
00:38:55.100 --> 00:39:00.300
you feel instead is faithless Joy

420
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.400
less

421
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.000
defeated

422
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.900
you might even wonder.

423
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.800
If God wants anything to do with your messy life.

424
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.600
Well, if I got good news for you friends that he

425
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.200
does Christmas in itself is

426
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.400
God's yes to that question

427
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.500
that I just asked.

428
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.700
Does God want anything to do with my messy life Christmas is

429
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.100
God's answer screaming? Yes that

430
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.900
it Christmas is for the weary Christmas for

431
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.000
the messed up. Christmas is for the broken.

432
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:37.800
Christmas is for you.

433
00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.400
Because remember not only were those in the Old Testament walking in darkness

434
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.900
as they waited for that Messiah to come. We are

435
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.200
walking in darkness to

436
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:54.300
We are the ones who chase after all these false

437
00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.000
sources of light.

438
00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.000
That only lead to further darkness and more Brokenness and

439
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.300
never satisfy. That's what makes our

440
00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.500
lives dark and empty. That's what makes us feel

441
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.500
like we do. It's a problem that God's word calls sin.

442
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.800
It's what separates you from that light of God.

443
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.600
That's talking about your own sin. Of course that brings Carnage. We

444
00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.000
all know that we have all look back at our history and we know

445
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.300
that our sin brings hardship, but it's also just

446
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.200
sin in general.

447
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.200
That this world is fractured. It's not the way it's supposed

448
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.800
to be and in general sin brings struggle.

449
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.500
people die

450
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.700
we experience loss.

451
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:36.700
We get sick.

452
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.300
But hear me, that's the world that Jesus entered into.

453
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.200
See don't get this picture like maybe from that nativity scene

454
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.400
that you have at the house. You put out every year that that was some

455
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.200
kind of perfect vision of life that everything

456
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.300
was great the star the Shepherds like it

457
00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.500
was all perfect. No.

458
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.800
Jesus was born in the middle of nowhere.

459
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.000
to pour nobody parents

460
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.500
in the midst of farm animals

461
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.800
This was the world that was full of pain and

462
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.500
Brokenness the Roman Empire people were

463
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.000
feeling oppressed. They were lonely. This was

464
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.800
all circling around this yet into that world.

465
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.100
Is the world that the Son of God the word of

466
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.300
God took on flesh and dwelt Among Us.

467
00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.600
He became a baby to identify with our

468
00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.200
Humanity.

469
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.500
He could have stayed away. He could have stayed out there above

470
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.400
the mess, but he entered into it and became

471
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.500
a baby to feel it with us.

472
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.500
But here's what we can do with Christmas we can leave it there.

473
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.600
But that's not the end of the story, right?

474
00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.500
Jesus didn't just stay a baby. He grew

475
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.300
up and lived the perfect life that you and I can't live

476
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.500
now. He then died the death that you and I deserve

477
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.300
because we can't live that life and then he came out

478
00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.300
of the Grave on the third day to defeat sin and death that we

479
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.500
could never defeat on our own. That's the whole story of

480
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.800
Christmas that Resurrection light has

481
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.100
come.

482
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.300
And darkness cannot overcome it anymore.

483
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.300
Darkness brings death

484
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.700
Jesus defeated death. The resurrection light has come.

485
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.400
So whether hear me whether you think you have it all

486
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.900
together tonight or not.

487
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.100
That's actually what Christmas is all about. Charlie Brown, right?

488
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.500
The light has come and the Darkness cannot overcome it

489
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.200
and he came for you no matter how dark you think your life

490
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.900
is he came?

491
00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.100
Mess and all he came into it.

492
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.800
But I want to be clear about something.

493
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:57.300
His salvation that we're talking about here is not automatically applied

494
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.100
to everyone.

495
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.600
We're not universalists.

496
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.300
because even when Jesus was born into his Jewish Family

497
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.800
many did not believe who he truly was.

498
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.200
They rejected him they refused to

499
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.100
believe that he was the true king and savior that they

500
00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:17.200
need.

501
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.200
And it didn't matter how faithful they were to their Jewish heritage.

502
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.200
It didn't matter how good of a person they were at that

503
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.200
point. It didn't matter because Jesus is the only way to

504
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.400
the father. He's the only way to Salvation the only way to

505
00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.200
light the only way to life.

506
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.500
So the question we need to ask tonight is have you rejected

507
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.000
Jesus?

508
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.400
Now I'm going to assume.

509
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.800
In most cases here tonight. It's probably not an active rejection

510
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.500
of Jesus because because you came to Christmas

511
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.500
Eve here, maybe your grandma drug you

512
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.500
here, but but I get like most of you would agree with

513
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.200
pretty much everything I've said tonight.

514
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.400
Like you grew up in church.

515
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.500
You have a good track record. You

516
00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.100
didn't do anything too bad. I mean you're way better than the jerk down

517
00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.400
the street at least right? So you're not a bad person. You're a

518
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.400
good decent human being living in Middle America here and

519
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.100
everything is seeming to be okay.

520
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.100
So you're not actively rejecting Jesus, but you might

521
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.600
have passively rejected him.

522
00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.700
By not acknowledging that he calls

523
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.500
the shots in your life.

524
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.000
That he actually has the the

525
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.300
what what you need to follow in your life is

526
00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.100
his way not your way. You still live as if you're

527
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:43.700
in charge.

528
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.300
And you're walking in your old life just

529
00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.200
like you used to.

530
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.100
That is rejecting Jesus.

531
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.400
Because listen to what John 1 continues to say in verses 12

532
00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.000
and 13.

533
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.500
It says to all who did receive him.

534
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.500
Who believed in his name he gave the right to become

535
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.700
children of God.

536
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.100
But notice who were born not of

537
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.600
blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man, but born

538
00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.200
of God.

539
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.200
So again, you might say you believe in Jesus.

540
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.900
But the biblical concept of faith of belief

541
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.500
is more than just agreeing with information.

542
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:35.100
Like you agree that I have a red shirt on I guess so cool. I

543
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.300
believe that. Yes. This is way different. This is Faith.

544
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.400
This is trusting with your whole life and your

545
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.000
whole future.

546
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.300
This is what leads to what he just said being reborn.

547
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.400
Now you might be like Nicodemus in John 3 saying well, how can I enter back

548
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.200
into my mother? Like that's confusing, right? Yes, of course. He says we've

549
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.300
all been born physically. Once what we all need

550
00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.700
though is to be reborn spiritually.

551
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.700
To be made new that the the Creator God would

552
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.400
remake us from the inside out

553
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.600
with a new heart a new way a

554
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.400
new desire from what God has planted in

555
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.700
us that's different.

556
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.400
That's what we need. That's what true salvation is. And that's

557
00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.200
what we all desperately have to

558
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.000
have to be with God.

559
00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.800
But that only happens when you place your trust in jesus' life

560
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.400
death and Resurrection in your place for your salvation.

561
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.600
That's the only way this Light of Christ will come

562
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.300
into your life and make you his child. I

563
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.200
mean just just stop and think for that for a second. He says

564
00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.000
be child of God. You'll be a child of God.

565
00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.800
Think of the privilege that is for the the

566
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.200
son of the king the daughter of the king of

567
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.700
any Kingdom to be able to just walk right into the the

568
00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.700
king's quarters.

569
00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.500
To have full access no matter when whatever

570
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.700
they have every privilege of the child of

571
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:07.100
the king.

572
00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.300
That's what he says.

573
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:11.900
you will have

574
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.700
When you're reborn into his family spiritually.

575
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.100
To be a child of God.

576
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:24.100
Acknowledge him as your king and his

577
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.300
work in your place and you will

578
00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.200
be saved.

579
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.200
Here's the thing. You can't you can't create that light in

580
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.600
yourself. You can't spark like you're holding that candle you you can't

581
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.100
make that thing light up on your own if you can we need to

582
00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.800
have conversation later, but you see you can't make that happen.

583
00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.600
You can't make this light shine in your heart Yourself by

584
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.500
being good enough or anything like that. It's been said this way the

585
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:50.700
light isn't something that has sprung from within

586
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.400
the world, but rather has dawned upon

587
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:53.400
it.

588
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.100
The coming living dying and raising of Jesus

589
00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.100
is what he did for our Salvation that we could not

590
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.800
do for ourselves merely by being good.

591
00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.300
The gospel is not good advice pointing out the things

592
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:11.300
we can do to make ourselves right with God. It's good news informing

593
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.300
us to the things God has done on our behalf.

594
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.700
That's the whole point of what we celebrate tonight. And every time

595
00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.400
we gather it's not how much we have done. Look at

596
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.200
how great we are. It's like look how bad we are that we

597
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.700
needed somebody to do it for us.

598
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.300
And God himself has done it.

599
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.000
And so how will you receive Jesus tonight?

600
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.300
Maybe you don't have any relationship with him at

601
00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.200
all. Will you receive his work in your place as the

602
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.700
gift of Grace? It was meant to be.

603
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.400
To see him as the light and the life you need and turn from

604
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.300
your sin and turn to him. That's what he would love to

605
00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.600
give you this present of salvation.

606
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.400
But listen, this is not just for unbelievers believer. Listen, this is

607
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.500
the same truth. You hear over and over

608
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.500
and over, but will you be freshly reminded tonight?

609
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:10.300
Of how the tender Mercy from on a high has dawned

610
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.600
upon you.

611
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:13.700
how that sunrise

612
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.500
it's like Joe talked about this morning how how the sunrise has

613
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.200
shined?

614
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.300
And it's glimmers of light and we see it for the first time

615
00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.400
that the darkness has not overcome it.

616
00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.200
That the mornings showing up.

617
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.400
And someday that day is coming in full.

618
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.500
That is what

619
00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.000
We Believe changes everything

620
00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.300
That the Light of Christ let that believer let that

621
00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.100
change everything tonight.

622
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.500
But not just tonight every night, right?

623
00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.700
Until Jesus comes back again.

624
00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:58.900
That's why that candle of light is the final candle of Advent that

625
00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.600
we will light this season. It's the one representing Jesus

626
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.000
his light that he is, of course

627
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.700
the hope and the peace the joy and the love of every

628
00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.300
longing heart, but he's also the light and

629
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.200
so I want to invite the steel and family up here tonight to lead us

630
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.200

631

632

633
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.700
candle read some scripture and

634
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.300
pray for light to flood Our Lives

635
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.400
This is Isaiah's 60 versus 1 through

636
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.900
3 and 18 through 20.

637
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.500
Arise Shine for your light has

Gates praise.

The sun shall be no more your light by

651
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.800

652
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.100

For the Lord will be your Everlasting Light and your

657

days of mourning shall be ended.

658
00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.100
Would you please pray with me?

659
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.300
Dear God we thank you so much for this Christmas Eve where we

660
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.700
can gather together and praise you as a church family. We thank

661
00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.000
you that you sent your one and only son to save us from the

662
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:16.200
price of death and to defeat sin and darkness forever Lord It's

663
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.200
So miraculous how even all the way back in the

664
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.500
book of Isaiah. You promised us this gift of eternal

665
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:21.500
life.

666
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.600
We thank you that you are a god of unconditional Covenant and

667
00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.100
that no matter what we do you will always fulfill your

668
00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:28.600
promises.

669
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.100
God we know that it can be really easy this time of

670
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:35.300
year to get caught up in the Stress and Anxiety that comes

671
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.300
along with the Christmas season. I ask that you would please

672
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:41.200
draw us back to the true meaning of Christmas and that

673
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.100
you would just help us really rejoice in the fact

674
00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.200
that we are not slaves to sin anymore.

675
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:50.800
I also pray for the people who are hurting this Christmas. I ask

676
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.300
that you would just wrap your all-powerful arms around

677
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.200
the Brokenhearted and shower the hurt Souls with

678
00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.100
your goodness and love.

679
00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.000
God this year. We really want to come back to your feet. We

680
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.300
pray that you would yearn our hearts to really understand

681
00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:06.900
what it means to have the true Spirit of Christmas and that

682
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:09.500
you would show us how to love like you did this holiday

683
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:12.400
season. We pray all of these things in Jesus name.

684
00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.000
Amen.

685
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.500
Thank you, Steven.

686
00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.000
So we are going to now.

687
00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:28.500
Symbolize how this light?

688
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.100
Of Christ comes to each one of us.

689
00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:36.300
So you have the candle hopefully on the way in

690
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:39.400
you grabbed one. If not that you can quickly go find one.

691
00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.800
But in a moment, we're going to have a few of us take the

692
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.300
light from the middle candle.

693
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.200
The Light of Christ and we're going to

694
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.500
begin Distributing that light no notice

695
00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.100
how this works right? It's person to person.

696
00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.700
That's how God ordained this to work.

697
00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.800
And so as you believer have received

698
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.600
the light.

699
00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.200
It is now our responsibility to turn and give that

700
00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.300
light to all those around us.

701
00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.600
Next to us in front of us behind us.

702
00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.200
Let's live out what Christ has called us

703
00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:20.400
to with his light. So if you're going to

704
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.400
distribute it go ahead and come on up and begin your rest

705
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.800
of you would stand with us if you're able and we will begin to

706
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.700
sing as we see God share his

707
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:30.200
light.

708
00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:17.900
You the

709
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:19.300

711

Long lay the

712
00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:43.100
world in sin

713
00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:46.800
and never applying.

Oh here.

722
00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:38.900
s

723
00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.900
when Christ was born

724
00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.200
his law is

725
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.600
And is Gospel is

726
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.500
peace?

727
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:30.600
Shall he

728
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:34.800
break for the slaves?

729
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:41.300
And in his name?

730
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.300
sweet hymns of

731
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:55.000
joy

732
00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:00.800
in grateful chorus ways.

733
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.100
We

734
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.700
let all always.

735
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:26.500
Here here.

736
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.200
when Christ was born

737
00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:25.900
really wish you could see this view up here. We appear get

738
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:29.000
the privilege every year to see this view. It's

739
00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.700
an amazing picture.

740
00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.400
but I want you to see how

741
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.600
Your one candle whenever it was just one

742
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:37.400
in a dark room.

743
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.300
Did light up?

744
00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.400
A little bit around you, right?

745
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.000
But look at how all of our candles banded together lights

746
00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:47.800
up the whole room.

747
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:52.000
This is what the church is meant to be. We together

748
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.900
the Light of Christ in US

749
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.300
individually in us together.

750
00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.100
Can light up a very dark place. That's what

751
01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:05.000
God wants for us as we pass it on to others. He

752
01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.100
then lights up the world as we are

753
01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.500
the light of the world now.

754
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.200
through us

755
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.300
but also want to bring another

756
01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.200
image to us and when you be careful, so parents might

757
01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.600
coach your kids on this one to blow the candles out now and want

758
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.400
to sit on this just for a second once the candles are

759
01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.000
blown out. So let's go and do that.

760
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.000
Okay, so you see now?

761
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.100
The darkness when the light is gone.

762
01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:44.300
So this is what the world feels like. This is what

763
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.300
people walk in darkness feeling and so

764
01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.500
we have that now.

765
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.200
Just as a feeling for that. All right, you can bring the lights back up now.

766
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.400
as we

767
01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.600
celebrate it tonight. That's our hope.

768
01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.600
Is that you see the Light of Christ through his word

769
01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.000
through the gospel and through his people.

770
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.200
And so we want to invite you to be back tomorrow morning

771
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.400
10:30 will be here actually over in the activity center down

772
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.500
the hall over there be worshiping unique way that

773
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.300
way and then next Sunday on January 1st. We're

774
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.700
going to kick off a week of prayer as a church where we

775
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.900
have a value called desperate dependence that says

776
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:25.800
God we rely on you to do everything and so we're gonna start 2023

777
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.200
off with a week of prayer. I'll explain more about that

778
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.200
as we get to that on January 1st, but we hope to see

779
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.000
you again soon. Let me pray for us as we go

780
01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.000
to the rest of our night. Thank you God for this.

781
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.800
Thank you for the blessing of families. Thank you for the blessing of

782
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.600
of friends. Thank you for the blessing of the gospel

783
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.500
and the church. We pray that now as

784
01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.200
we have seen this picture of light.

785
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.400
That you would pour it into our souls that it would

786
01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.400
shine brightly through US individually and through

787
01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.100
us as a church.

788
01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.300
May we keep our eyes fixed on you. Maybe remind us

789
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.700
of what we have in you God.

790
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.400
And send us now for your glory to the

791
01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.400
ends of the Earth to our neighborhoods to our workplaces to our

792
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.000
homes with the mission of light on

793
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.600
our lips. Thank you God.

794
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.600
May you receive the glory in all of this in jesus' Authority

795
01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.300
we pray. Amen. Amen. Love you Church

796
01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.400
Merry Christmas you are sent.
