WEBVTT

1
00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:19.525
Well good morning church.

2
00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:20.845
It's great to see you.

3
00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:23.565
Uh, if you are new to our church, we're glad you'd be here.

4
00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:25.125
We'd just ask one simple thing.

5
00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.645
You'd introduce yourself to somebody.

6
00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:29.285
There's a new here area out there just to help you connect.

7
00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.285
We wanna help you find a place here.

8
00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:33.085
Uh, but also if you've been here

9
00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:34.765
for a long time, uh, we don't forget you.

10
00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:37.045
We're glad you're here as well and we love you.

11
00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:40.725
Uh, it's a joy to be together as we walk into

12
00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:41.725
what we're gonna study today.

13
00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:43.925
We're continuing our series through the book

14
00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:45.365
of Second Samuel today.

15
00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:48.965
We reach really the mountaintop of the book.

16
00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.965
Many scholars believe this is kind of the pinnacle

17
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.485
of the entire Old Testament.

18
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.565
What we're gonna study today is God's covenant

19
00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:03.045
with King David of Israel, how God made a promise to David

20
00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:06.565
that was in part fulfilled in David's life,

21
00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:09.685
but more so fulfilled through David's lineage,

22
00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:14.205
through his genealogy, specifically

23
00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:17.445
through the promise of a forever king

24
00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:21.165
of an eternal son,

25
00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:24.405
who we now know to be Jesus.

26
00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:28.045
But two Samuel seven is the link

27
00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:31.085
to all those promises made in the Old Testament

28
00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:33.605
fulfilled in Jesus.

29
00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.925
Now, why does this matter? Well, first of all, it matters

30
00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:40.605
for our eternal salvation, right?

31
00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:42.925
We don't have a savior, we don't have salvation.

32
00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:47.725
Uh, and really we can argue that the entire Bible is one arc

33
00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:50.805
of redemption as we would see it flow

34
00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:53.205
through this covenant specifically.

35
00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:56.085
But this also matters not just for that.

36
00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:58.605
It matters for how we go about our daily lives.

37
00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:05.115
See, if you and I believe that God keeps his promises

38
00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:10.135
that he is faithful, that belief will affect

39
00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:12.615
how we live our day-to-day lives, won't it?

40
00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:16.415
Right? If you believe that,

41
00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:18.415
that God keeps his promises he's faithful,

42
00:02:18.415 --> 00:02:20.695
that means you're gonna be less worried When hard things

43
00:02:20.725 --> 00:02:25.135
come your way every day you're gonna be less troubled

44
00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:26.255
by the state of the world.

45
00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:29.895
You're gonna be able to have joy in suffering.

46
00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:31.495
You're gonna be able to have peace and chaos.

47
00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:33.695
If you believe God is who he says he is

48
00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.135
and he keeps his promises, that's

49
00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:36.815
what you will be able to do.

50
00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:40.495
That's why this is important today to remember

51
00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:45.215
that we serve a promise keeping God who is good

52
00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:48.375
to his people and faithful in all his ways.

53
00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:52.375
If we walk away with nothing else, just remember

54
00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:54.015
that and we'll be okay.

55
00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:55.655
So God, we pray as that truth

56
00:02:56.545 --> 00:03:01.125
would just settle into our hearts today, that you teach us

57
00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:04.725
through your word as we've just been walking through it.

58
00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:07.565
You show us today uniquely something you want us to see,

59
00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:10.205
but not just to hear it.

60
00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:13.805
God, as James says, that we would be doers of the word

61
00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:18.155
as well and that you fill us so

62
00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:20.355
with your spirit that we can't help

63
00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:22.835
but speak of what we've seen and heard.

64
00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:26.755
As Acts four says, thank you for being good.

65
00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:28.995
Thank you for being faithful. Remind us of that truth.

66
00:03:29.065 --> 00:03:33.275
Wash over us today as we need that in Jesus' name. Amen.

67
00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:37.955
So look with me now at Second Samuel chapter seven.

68
00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:41.275
We're gonna be just in the first three verses

69
00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:43.235
to set the stage first.

70
00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:49.005
Now, when the king, that's David,

71
00:03:49.075 --> 00:03:50.725
when the king lived in his house

72
00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:54.245
and the Lord had given him rest from all his surrounding

73
00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:57.525
enemies, the king said to Nathan, the prophet,

74
00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:00.405
see now I dwell in a house of cedar,

75
00:04:00.545 --> 00:04:02.725
but the Ark of God dwells in a tent.

76
00:04:03.865 --> 00:04:07.085
And Nathan said to the king, go do all that is in your heart

77
00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:08.485
for the Lord is with you.

78
00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:12.535
Now, as you'll see again in the chart we've been showing

79
00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:15.575
most weeks, we're not completely sure

80
00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:19.015
where this scene happened chronologically in the whole

81
00:04:19.085 --> 00:04:22.495
narrative because in the next couple chapters,

82
00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.415
we're actually gonna see more

83
00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:24.855
battles that David has to fight.

84
00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:26.415
So it seems like he's given rest here.

85
00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:27.735
So we're not totally sure.

86
00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:30.335
Regardless, we're now at the stage at least

87
00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:33.095
where David's the king of all of Israel, not just Judah,

88
00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:34.695
all 12 tribes.

89
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:36.055
He's the king. And

90
00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:39.535
whenever this rest from the battle actually happened,

91
00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:43.015
what it provided for David was an opportunity for him

92
00:04:43.035 --> 00:04:44.455
to stop and reflect.

93
00:04:46.675 --> 00:04:49.655
And you remember David's heart was oriented toward God.

94
00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:50.775
He is a man after God's own heart.

95
00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:54.615
And so his heart naturally gravitated toward worship

96
00:04:54.725 --> 00:04:55.895
towards God.

97
00:04:57.515 --> 00:04:59.975
And so as he did that, he sat back and he's looking around

98
00:05:00.035 --> 00:05:02.215
and as he, he lifted his eyes to God,

99
00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:03.895
he was convicted in his heart

100
00:05:06.085 --> 00:05:09.135
that he lived in a really nice house paneled with cedar.

101
00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:13.335
Probably was nicer than the old laminate wood paneling

102
00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:15.135
that was in your room when you were growing up, right?

103
00:05:15.165 --> 00:05:17.055
Like that's not what we're talking about.

104
00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:18.815
These are like really nice cedar walls.

105
00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.255
Okay, probably not look like that.

106
00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:25.015
But the place where God's arc dwelled,

107
00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:27.295
which was the symbol of God's presence with his people,

108
00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:30.215
was some tent curtains around it.

109
00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:34.585
Just a, a really comparatively low place

110
00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:35.745
to where David was living.

111
00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:38.825
So David was like, man, what's what's able, what?

112
00:05:38.825 --> 00:05:39.865
What can we do to fix that?

113
00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:44.185
Just as an interesting side note here, when

114
00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:49.425
in this season of blessing it said David had rest.

115
00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:51.945
He was living in a house, he, he was peaceful.

116
00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:53.585
In that season of peace

117
00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:56.625
and blessing, his heart was drawn toward

118
00:05:56.765 --> 00:05:58.605
God, not away from God.

119
00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:01.965
It's just an interesting check for us.

120
00:06:02.325 --> 00:06:05.005
'cause often whenever we experience blessing,

121
00:06:05.005 --> 00:06:07.445
when we experience rest, man, we drift from God.

122
00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:10.205
Just be careful with that.

123
00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:13.165
As you experience the the winds of God behind you

124
00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:15.485
for a while, like don't run away,

125
00:06:15.735 --> 00:06:18.085
press harder into the Lord.

126
00:06:20.215 --> 00:06:22.355
But it seemed like for David, this was a logical move.

127
00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:25.315
The ark is in a tent. I live in a nice house.

128
00:06:25.395 --> 00:06:27.035
I wanna build God a house.

129
00:06:27.185 --> 00:06:29.795
Even Nathan, the prophet introduced here for the first time,

130
00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:31.515
he'll be pretty critical over the next few weeks.

131
00:06:32.455 --> 00:06:33.635
He seemed to affirm this.

132
00:06:33.735 --> 00:06:35.835
It seems like okay, seems like that's right.

133
00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:39.435
Let's go for it. But watch what happens next.

134
00:06:39.495 --> 00:06:40.515
Verses four through seven,

135
00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:48.835
But that same night, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, go

136
00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:52.075
and tell my servant David, thus says the Lord,

137
00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.155
would you build me a house to dwell in?

138
00:06:56.275 --> 00:06:58.515
I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the

139
00:06:58.515 --> 00:07:00.275
people of Israel from Egypt to this day,

140
00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:02.715
but I've been moving about in a tent

141
00:07:02.715 --> 00:07:04.835
for my dwelling in all the places where I've moved

142
00:07:04.835 --> 00:07:06.035
with all the people of Israel.

143
00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:08.155
Did I speak a word with any of the judges

144
00:07:08.215 --> 00:07:10.155
of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people

145
00:07:10.155 --> 00:07:11.475
of Israel saying,

146
00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:14.555
why have you not built me a house of cedar?

147
00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:18.995
Right? So God says to David, basically through Nathan, no,

148
00:07:21.285 --> 00:07:22.555
David, do you wanna build me a house?

149
00:07:22.695 --> 00:07:27.355
No, never asked anyone to build me a house.

150
00:07:28.895 --> 00:07:30.475
In fact, I don't need one.

151
00:07:30.855 --> 00:07:35.235
God says it's the same thing that the Apostle Paul said

152
00:07:35.295 --> 00:07:38.515
to the Athenians in Acts 17, 24 and 25.

153
00:07:38.575 --> 00:07:40.275
He says, the God who made the world

154
00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.475
and everything in it being Lord of heaven

155
00:07:42.535 --> 00:07:45.395
and earth does not live in temples made by man,

156
00:07:46.455 --> 00:07:49.355
nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything

157
00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:53.035
since he himself gives to all mankind life

158
00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:54.915
and breath and everything.

159
00:07:56.815 --> 00:07:59.915
And so God's not worried about what people think about him.

160
00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:03.755
Like, oh, he lives in a tent and this is a no.

161
00:08:03.755 --> 00:08:05.555
It's not worried about that. He's also not in

162
00:08:05.555 --> 00:08:07.235
that tent shivering because he's cold.

163
00:08:07.235 --> 00:08:09.315
There's no walls. That's not at all the worry.

164
00:08:09.575 --> 00:08:11.315
God doesn't need anything.

165
00:08:13.925 --> 00:08:15.865
In fact, he'd been just as active

166
00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:18.865
in Israel without a building to begin with.

167
00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:24.535
And so what God did is he flipped the script on David.

168
00:08:25.635 --> 00:08:28.135
It Wasn't what David could do for God.

169
00:08:28.315 --> 00:08:31.015
It was what God had done for David.

170
00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:34.695
Look at verses eight and nine

171
00:08:39.255 --> 00:08:42.035
now, therefore, thus you, Nathan shall say to my servant,

172
00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:44.195
David, thus says the Lord of hosts,

173
00:08:44.835 --> 00:08:48.435
I took you from the pastor from following the sheep

174
00:08:48.825 --> 00:08:51.955
that you should be prince or leader over my people Israel.

175
00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:55.605
And I have been with you wherever you went,

176
00:08:56.065 --> 00:08:59.645
and I have cut off all your enemies from

177
00:09:00.065 --> 00:09:03.125
before you like.

178
00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:07.325
So just in two sentences, what did he start with?

179
00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.765
He says, okay, David, I don't need a house,

180
00:09:09.765 --> 00:09:11.165
but here's what I wanna remind you of.

181
00:09:11.265 --> 00:09:15.765
He started by declaring his faithfulness to David,

182
00:09:17.675 --> 00:09:19.495
Hey David, listen, don't you remember?

183
00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:21.605
And this is what God's saying.

184
00:09:21.605 --> 00:09:22.725
Hey David, don't you remember?

185
00:09:23.185 --> 00:09:25.165
Here's what I have done for you.

186
00:09:26.985 --> 00:09:31.725
It took him two sentences, really simple but profound ways.

187
00:09:32.345 --> 00:09:36.525
God reminded David of all his gracious blessings,

188
00:09:38.925 --> 00:09:40.495
that he'd never left David alone.

189
00:09:40.645 --> 00:09:43.055
He'd never left Israel, his people alone.

190
00:09:43.325 --> 00:09:46.095
He'd never been anything other

191
00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.895
than sufficient for them.

192
00:09:53.485 --> 00:09:55.215
Just think about that for a second in your life.

193
00:09:58.825 --> 00:10:03.115
Just a simple question. How has God been faithful to you?

194
00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:09.465
When you think about and consider

195
00:10:10.275 --> 00:10:12.945
reflecting on his blessings, on his goodness to you,

196
00:10:14.575 --> 00:10:15.665
just a simple question.

197
00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:19.705
How has God been faithful to you?

198
00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:26.365
I'm not standing up here and denying that life can be hard.

199
00:10:28.775 --> 00:10:30.415
I know some stories in this room right now.

200
00:10:30.415 --> 00:10:31.455
Life is really hard

201
00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:35.395
and even a lot of history can look like

202
00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:38.515
anything other than faithfulness of God.

203
00:10:38.615 --> 00:10:40.555
But, but I wanna just ask a question.

204
00:10:43.995 --> 00:10:45.135
God has brought you

205
00:10:45.135 --> 00:10:47.495
through every situation you've ever been in, right?

206
00:10:51.045 --> 00:10:54.335
Just, just think about that. You're still here,

207
00:10:55.275 --> 00:10:58.255
you're standing, you're pursuing the Lord, you're,

208
00:10:58.255 --> 00:11:00.775
you might be crawling, but you're pursuing.

209
00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:03.135
You want him. You're here for a reason.

210
00:11:03.515 --> 00:11:06.255
You are still, God has brought you through every

211
00:11:06.775 --> 00:11:08.575
situation you've ever been in.

212
00:11:08.755 --> 00:11:11.775
You know why? Because he's always been faithful to you.

213
00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:20.415
He's never left you. He's never abandoned you.

214
00:11:21.605 --> 00:11:23.135
He's gonna bring you home someday,

215
00:11:26.035 --> 00:11:28.495
and he's actually as hard as it can be

216
00:11:28.715 --> 00:11:30.855
to see it in the moment He's actually working all

217
00:11:30.855 --> 00:11:33.935
of those things for his glory and for your good.

218
00:11:36.005 --> 00:11:38.255
He's always been faithful. He's always been good.

219
00:11:38.535 --> 00:11:40.815
I know it doesn't always feel good,

220
00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:42.575
and the enemy loves for you

221
00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:46.335
to sit in those bottom line feelings that are real

222
00:11:46.525 --> 00:11:47.575
that you feel,

223
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.975
but you have to go back to the top line truth

224
00:11:50.125 --> 00:11:51.975
that God has always been faithful to you.

225
00:11:52.205 --> 00:11:53.085
He's always brought me me

226
00:11:53.085 --> 00:11:54.165
through everything I've ever faced.

227
00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:58.125
He is faithful. He wants you down here.

228
00:11:58.225 --> 00:11:59.805
The enemy wants you to stay here.

229
00:12:00.065 --> 00:12:01.405
You have to keep coming back.

230
00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:04.445
Often it takes us looking back at his faithfulness

231
00:12:04.785 --> 00:12:07.245
to make sure we can better trust him in the moment today.

232
00:12:10.945 --> 00:12:14.425
How's he been faithful to you? Don't forget that.

233
00:12:19.055 --> 00:12:20.275
So God said no to David,

234
00:12:23.105 --> 00:12:24.845
but watch this divine reversal

235
00:12:26.655 --> 00:12:29.925
where God said he would instead build David A. House.

236
00:12:31.665 --> 00:12:32.965
Now you hear that and you think, okay,

237
00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:34.525
well God's gonna build a miss mansion.

238
00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:36.165
Like that's what kings have, right?

239
00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:38.685
It's actually very different.

240
00:12:38.685 --> 00:12:41.045
Watch this verses nine through 17.

241
00:12:44.975 --> 00:12:48.395
God says to David, I will make for you a great name

242
00:12:49.225 --> 00:12:50.755
like the name of the great ones of the earth.

243
00:12:51.235 --> 00:12:53.235
I will appoint a place for my people Israel

244
00:12:53.415 --> 00:12:55.635
and will plant them so they may dwell in their own

245
00:12:55.635 --> 00:12:56.755
place and be disturbed.

246
00:12:56.755 --> 00:12:59.155
No more and violent men shall afflict them.

247
00:12:59.175 --> 00:13:00.915
No more as formally from the time

248
00:13:00.915 --> 00:13:02.995
that I appointed judges over my people Israel,

249
00:13:03.355 --> 00:13:05.675
I will give you rest from all your enemies.

250
00:13:05.915 --> 00:13:07.435
Moreover, the Lord declares to you,

251
00:13:07.435 --> 00:13:09.115
the Lord will make you a house.

252
00:13:10.305 --> 00:13:12.235
When your days are fulfilled, you lie down

253
00:13:12.235 --> 00:13:14.075
with your fathers, meaning you die.

254
00:13:14.235 --> 00:13:15.915
I will raise up your offspring

255
00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:18.235
after you who shall come from your body,

256
00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:20.235
and I will establish his kingdom.

257
00:13:20.615 --> 00:13:22.475
He shall build a house for my name.

258
00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:25.195
I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.

259
00:13:25.675 --> 00:13:28.555
I will be to him a father. He shall be to me a son.

260
00:13:29.385 --> 00:13:31.635
When he commits iniquity, I'll discipline him with the rod

261
00:13:31.635 --> 00:13:33.755
of men, with the stripes of the sons of men.

262
00:13:33.935 --> 00:13:36.275
But my steadfast love will not depart from him

263
00:13:36.495 --> 00:13:38.835
as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from

264
00:13:38.935 --> 00:13:40.955
before you and your house.

265
00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:44.475
And your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.

266
00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:47.595
Your throne shall be established forever in accordance

267
00:13:47.595 --> 00:13:49.275
with all these words, in accordance with the vision.

268
00:13:49.415 --> 00:13:50.995
Nathan spoke to David,

269
00:13:51.895 --> 00:13:54.275
and so when I just read that church, those eight

270
00:13:54.275 --> 00:13:58.865
or nine verses, whatever it was, This is the meat

271
00:13:59.365 --> 00:14:01.905
of the covenant that God made with David.

272
00:14:03.655 --> 00:14:05.105
Like this is the covenant.

273
00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:07.905
This is the Davidic covenant God made with David.

274
00:14:07.905 --> 00:14:11.065
This is what I was talking about when all of the Bible,

275
00:14:12.215 --> 00:14:14.625
this is pointed to the pinnacle right here

276
00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:16.065
of the entire Old Testament.

277
00:14:17.205 --> 00:14:18.585
That's why you saw, right?

278
00:14:18.585 --> 00:14:20.425
You saw what God was saying to David.

279
00:14:21.085 --> 00:14:24.185
So much of the Old Testament points to this passage,

280
00:14:25.885 --> 00:14:28.065
you go find the Psalms and prophets.

281
00:14:28.065 --> 00:14:30.185
You see them coming back to this, pointing back

282
00:14:30.185 --> 00:14:31.625
to this promise God made for David,

283
00:14:31.665 --> 00:14:34.425
pointing back this promise God made to David.

284
00:14:34.815 --> 00:14:36.905
This is the pinnacle of the Old Testament,

285
00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:40.225
and this is the link with the New Testament.

286
00:14:41.885 --> 00:14:44.945
So many of the New Testament passages quote this

287
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:49.145
far more than all the Old Testament, other passages we find.

288
00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:51.605
We'll get to that in a second.

289
00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:53.245
But again, let's just look at this covenant.

290
00:14:54.405 --> 00:14:56.455
Look at what God said to David.

291
00:14:58.445 --> 00:14:59.735
I'll make for you a great name.

292
00:15:00.045 --> 00:15:02.295
I'll appoint a place for my people in peace.

293
00:15:02.565 --> 00:15:04.455
I'll make you a house. I'll establish

294
00:15:04.485 --> 00:15:05.615
your offsprings kingdom.

295
00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:07.695
I'll establish the throne of his kingdom forever.

296
00:15:08.005 --> 00:15:10.775
I'll beat him a father. He'll be to me, a son.

297
00:15:10.885 --> 00:15:12.815
Your house, your kingdom shall be made sure

298
00:15:12.885 --> 00:15:14.455
forever before me.

299
00:15:14.685 --> 00:15:19.495
Just imagine David hearing this. Is that not stunning?

300
00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:24.685
David wanted to build for God.

301
00:15:25.065 --> 00:15:26.325
God said, Nope, I'm gonna build for you.

302
00:15:27.965 --> 00:15:30.025
I'm gonna build for you and for my people.

303
00:15:30.245 --> 00:15:33.905
He gave him this promise of a son, a promise of a house,

304
00:15:34.385 --> 00:15:37.865
a promise of a throne that would last forever, a promise

305
00:15:37.925 --> 00:15:41.505
of a dynasty, something that would last far beyond David.

306
00:15:41.645 --> 00:15:45.535
He gave him that promise a prophecy.

307
00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:48.835
Now, here's what's interesting about this.

308
00:15:49.785 --> 00:15:53.875
This is a good example of what we call dual fulfillment

309
00:15:53.935 --> 00:15:56.515
or partial fulfillment of prophecy.

310
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.155
Because what we'll find,

311
00:16:00.255 --> 00:16:03.115
if you keep going past second Samuel, you'll find Solomon,

312
00:16:03.115 --> 00:16:06.995
one of David's sons actually did end up by God's command

313
00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:12.955
actually building what we call the temple a house

314
00:16:13.695 --> 00:16:14.715
for God in a way.

315
00:16:15.615 --> 00:16:17.315
And it was good. It was God's command.

316
00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:19.075
It was, it was needed, it was fine.

317
00:16:19.135 --> 00:16:20.315
It was nothing wrong with it.

318
00:16:20.415 --> 00:16:22.155
It was part of the plan of God.

319
00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:24.555
He did build a house in a sense.

320
00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:29.915
But if you read carefully in verse 13

321
00:16:29.975 --> 00:16:32.955
and verse 16, the word forever

322
00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:41.015
was describing this son who would sit

323
00:16:41.195 --> 00:16:43.575
and reign on the throne of his kingdom.

324
00:16:46.775 --> 00:16:50.435
Well, David ended up eventually dying,

325
00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:52.475
so he couldn't sit there.

326
00:16:52.895 --> 00:16:55.595
His son Solomon ended up eventually dying.

327
00:16:55.735 --> 00:16:58.395
So he couldn't sit there and Solomon's son and

328
00:16:58.495 --> 00:17:02.155
and every other son who is the king of Israel from

329
00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:04.235
that point on for the next hundreds

330
00:17:04.235 --> 00:17:07.035
and hundreds of years, they all ended up dying too.

331
00:17:07.615 --> 00:17:12.365
So This is pointing to something more.

332
00:17:14.915 --> 00:17:17.205
This is why we believe that this is the covenant

333
00:17:17.275 --> 00:17:19.965
that sets up the Messiah's reign

334
00:17:20.225 --> 00:17:22.365
as the eternal king.

335
00:17:23.985 --> 00:17:26.925
And spoiler alert, that's Jesus, right?

336
00:17:29.055 --> 00:17:32.625
This promise God made to David was partially fulfilled,

337
00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:37.785
but it was fully eternally fulfilled in Jesus.

338
00:17:37.965 --> 00:17:39.385
That's one reason a year

339
00:17:39.385 --> 00:17:40.545
and a half ago when we decided to

340
00:17:40.545 --> 00:17:41.585
start going through one Samuel.

341
00:17:42.205 --> 00:17:45.065
One reason was because we wanted to go in there and

342
00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:48.225
and help us understand why the term used

343
00:17:48.225 --> 00:17:50.365
of Jesus in the New Testament Son

344
00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:52.285
of David, why does that even matter?

345
00:17:53.025 --> 00:17:54.125
Why is that so important?

346
00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:58.325
Because that is a messianic, a savior term

347
00:17:59.905 --> 00:18:01.275
that goes all the way back

348
00:18:01.495 --> 00:18:03.555
to the promises God made a thousand years

349
00:18:03.555 --> 00:18:06.155
before Jesus showed up even a longer back

350
00:18:06.155 --> 00:18:08.195
before that you tie the covenants together.

351
00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:11.395
This chapter today is one reason the Son

352
00:18:11.395 --> 00:18:12.835
of David term matters

353
00:18:14.865 --> 00:18:16.355
because Israel was looking

354
00:18:16.975 --> 00:18:20.875
for a savior king from this promise made to David.

355
00:18:22.875 --> 00:18:24.445
They kept watching every king come

356
00:18:24.445 --> 00:18:25.965
through like, well, that's not the one.

357
00:18:26.895 --> 00:18:28.765
Maybe this is the one. Well, that's not the one.

358
00:18:28.855 --> 00:18:31.165
Maybe this is the one. That's not the one they were looking

359
00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:32.605
for a Messiah.

360
00:18:32.825 --> 00:18:34.325
The problem is, again, every one

361
00:18:34.325 --> 00:18:35.925
of 'em failed to fulfill it.

362
00:18:36.025 --> 00:18:38.445
So they were looking for a messiah, an eternal

363
00:18:38.995 --> 00:18:40.285
king that would come.

364
00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:42.465
They were looking for it.

365
00:18:42.925 --> 00:18:45.305
The prime time was when Jesus showed up,

366
00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:47.585
and here's how the New Testament phrases it.

367
00:18:47.845 --> 00:18:51.665
It says over and over, Jesus fulfilled this promise.

368
00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:54.575
Gimme a couple, just a couple examples.

369
00:18:55.075 --> 00:18:56.295
Two Corinthians six 18

370
00:18:56.315 --> 00:19:00.215
and Hebrews one five, quote that son father language

371
00:19:00.855 --> 00:19:02.215
directly and say, that's about Jesus.

372
00:19:03.745 --> 00:19:07.115
It's explicit John two, Jesus said,

373
00:19:07.115 --> 00:19:08.715
my body's the temple, not the building.

374
00:19:11.335 --> 00:19:14.665
Hebrews one, eight, Jesus is the forever king

375
00:19:15.215 --> 00:19:17.585
that fulfills the promise made to Judah.

376
00:19:17.735 --> 00:19:21.145
Back in Genesis 49, 10, God said, Judah,

377
00:19:21.205 --> 00:19:23.625
the scepter will not depart from you,

378
00:19:23.655 --> 00:19:27.665
meaning you'll have one from the king line forever.

379
00:19:28.355 --> 00:19:30.065
Jesus is the fulfillment of that.

380
00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:34.915
Even the genealogy support this.

381
00:19:35.855 --> 00:19:37.555
You know when you're reading through the Bible in a year

382
00:19:37.555 --> 00:19:39.395
or two years or whatever it is, you get to the genealogy,

383
00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:40.395
you wanna bail real fast.

384
00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:44.915
Why does this even matter? Like we're just,

385
00:19:45.075 --> 00:19:47.075
I can't say the names anyway, so why do I need to read it?

386
00:19:47.075 --> 00:19:49.195
Right? Okay. This is why

387
00:19:51.085 --> 00:19:53.225
you go read Matthew one, the genealogy there.

388
00:19:53.805 --> 00:19:58.425
It points to Jesus being in the royal line

389
00:19:58.605 --> 00:20:01.385
of David through his earthly father Joseph.

390
00:20:02.445 --> 00:20:05.945
The legal fathership of Joseph goes back to David,

391
00:20:06.195 --> 00:20:08.585
which then makes Jesus when you follow the trace

392
00:20:08.585 --> 00:20:13.345
through the genealogy, Jesus is the rightful king of Israel.

393
00:20:14.725 --> 00:20:15.985
That's what Matthew was saying.

394
00:20:16.015 --> 00:20:17.865
He's like, guys, listen, this is not an accident.

395
00:20:17.965 --> 00:20:22.145
He came through, David was promised this Jesus is the one

396
00:20:24.475 --> 00:20:26.535
We could go keep going again and again over

397
00:20:26.535 --> 00:20:28.935
and over in the New Testament, it all points to the fact

398
00:20:28.935 --> 00:20:32.455
that Jesus was the fulfillment of the saving promise.

399
00:20:32.755 --> 00:20:35.335
The eternal king. It was coming in the Messiah.

400
00:20:35.605 --> 00:20:40.235
It's Jesus not fulfilled.

401
00:20:40.235 --> 00:20:42.435
In hundreds of years of kings that failed,

402
00:20:42.435 --> 00:20:43.835
that failed, that failed, that failed.

403
00:20:43.855 --> 00:20:44.875
It finally came to pass.

404
00:20:45.135 --> 00:20:47.605
The Son of David shows up, he's the Savior.

405
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:52.005
That leads me to the question next.

406
00:20:54.335 --> 00:20:56.225
Have you trusted in this savior king,

407
00:21:00.575 --> 00:21:05.285
have you placed your faith in

408
00:21:05.285 --> 00:21:07.365
that savior king?

409
00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:10.765
I mean, he set this up.

410
00:21:11.635 --> 00:21:14.285
This is not just Jesus being some accident

411
00:21:14.345 --> 00:21:17.965
or some kind of emotional pick me up that we need.

412
00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:22.485
Jesus is the promised one to save his people.

413
00:21:22.665 --> 00:21:26.445
All of the promises of God find their yes in Jesus.

414
00:21:26.755 --> 00:21:30.445
He's the one who reigns forever on the throne.

415
00:21:30.755 --> 00:21:34.125
He's where eternal rest and eternal blessing is found.

416
00:21:34.355 --> 00:21:37.245
He's the only way out of your sins against the holy God.

417
00:21:37.355 --> 00:21:40.285
He's the only way that can forgive your sins against him.

418
00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:42.685
How He lived the perfect life. You and I couldn't live.

419
00:21:42.825 --> 00:21:45.565
He died the death you and I deserve for our sin.

420
00:21:45.745 --> 00:21:48.445
He defeated sin to death by coming outta the grave alive.

421
00:21:48.585 --> 00:21:51.285
He ascended back to the throne of the kingdom

422
00:21:51.715 --> 00:21:53.365
that he reigns now forever.

423
00:21:53.825 --> 00:21:57.165
And all of that means you have to do something with him.

424
00:22:01.155 --> 00:22:04.545
Again, Jesus is not just an optional add-on to your life.

425
00:22:07.935 --> 00:22:12.785
He's not just a good teacher. He's not just a moral example.

426
00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:17.145
He's not just someone you can go to when you're sad.

427
00:22:17.175 --> 00:22:19.465
He's not a consultant to your life,

428
00:22:19.465 --> 00:22:20.945
that you run it the way you want it to

429
00:22:20.945 --> 00:22:22.225
and he just gives you some advice.

430
00:22:25.515 --> 00:22:28.975
He is the revelation 1916 king of kings

431
00:22:29.075 --> 00:22:32.495
and Lord of Lords, the alpha and the Omega, the beginning

432
00:22:32.715 --> 00:22:34.535
and the end, and he's coming back

433
00:22:34.795 --> 00:22:36.895
to judge the living and the dead.

434
00:22:37.075 --> 00:22:39.695
And your only hope when he comes back to get outta

435
00:22:39.695 --> 00:22:41.135
that is not just to agree

436
00:22:41.135 --> 00:22:42.575
with everything I've said here today.

437
00:22:43.405 --> 00:22:46.615
Your only hope is to say, Jesus, I place my trust,

438
00:22:46.915 --> 00:22:51.495
my faith in you and what you have accomplished on my behalf.

439
00:22:52.835 --> 00:22:53.855
You can't be good enough.

440
00:22:55.655 --> 00:22:58.395
You cannot because you've already blown it.

441
00:22:59.695 --> 00:23:01.755
And so stop trying. Stop striving.

442
00:23:01.905 --> 00:23:03.195
Instead, just open your hands.

443
00:23:03.225 --> 00:23:05.915
Open your heart to trust in Jesus, in your place

444
00:23:06.095 --> 00:23:09.595
to count all else as loss for the sake of knowing him.

445
00:23:09.975 --> 00:23:12.755
That's what saving faith is biblically.

446
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:19.245
So again, do you trust him?

447
00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:24.075
Maybe You've grown up in church your whole life

448
00:23:25.015 --> 00:23:26.835
and you've trusted in a whole lot of other things,

449
00:23:27.345 --> 00:23:28.995
including yourself primarily.

450
00:23:31.555 --> 00:23:35.465
Do you believe? Do you have faith in Jesus?

451
00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:41.625
Because here's what ought to happen.

452
00:23:44.435 --> 00:23:46.685
When I like, when I recognize my sinfulness

453
00:23:48.615 --> 00:23:49.995
and I acknowledge God's grace

454
00:23:50.215 --> 00:23:54.765
and his love for me, watch

455
00:23:54.835 --> 00:23:55.885
what ought to happen.

456
00:23:57.435 --> 00:23:58.985
David gives us a great

457
00:23:58.985 --> 00:24:02.545
example starting in verse 18.

458
00:24:03.355 --> 00:24:03.945
Watch this.

459
00:24:09.605 --> 00:24:12.655
Then after he'd heard all of that from God through Nathan,

460
00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:18.975
then King David went in and sat before the Lord

461
00:24:21.125 --> 00:24:22.265
and said, who am I?

462
00:24:22.525 --> 00:24:25.445
Oh Lord God. And what is my house

463
00:24:25.445 --> 00:24:26.765
that you've brought me thus far?

464
00:24:28.705 --> 00:24:30.645
And yet this was a small thing in your eyes.

465
00:24:31.925 --> 00:24:35.335
Oh Lord God, you've spoken also of your servant's house

466
00:24:35.835 --> 00:24:37.375
for a great while to come.

467
00:24:37.955 --> 00:24:40.255
And this is instruction for mankind. Oh Lord God.

468
00:24:41.635 --> 00:24:45.005
What more can David say to you for you know your servant,

469
00:24:45.105 --> 00:24:48.315
oh Lord God, because of your promise

470
00:24:48.335 --> 00:24:49.355
and according to your own heart,

471
00:24:49.515 --> 00:24:51.315
you've brought about all this greatness

472
00:24:51.415 --> 00:24:52.995
to make your servant know it.

473
00:24:54.185 --> 00:24:56.875
Therefore, you are great, oh Lord God,

474
00:24:57.055 --> 00:24:59.755
for there is none like you and there is no God

475
00:24:59.755 --> 00:25:02.675
besides you according to all that we've heard with our ears.

476
00:25:03.575 --> 00:25:04.915
And who is like your people, Israel,

477
00:25:05.055 --> 00:25:07.195
the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem

478
00:25:07.195 --> 00:25:09.875
to be his people, making himself a name, doing

479
00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:13.155
for them great and awesome things by driving out

480
00:25:13.155 --> 00:25:16.035
before your people whom you redeem for yourself from Egypt,

481
00:25:16.235 --> 00:25:19.115
a nation and its Gods you established for yourself,

482
00:25:19.115 --> 00:25:21.235
your people, Israel, to be your people forever.

483
00:25:21.615 --> 00:25:23.355
And you, oh Lord, became their God.

484
00:25:24.855 --> 00:25:27.995
And now, oh Lord God, confirm forever the word you've spoken

485
00:25:28.005 --> 00:25:30.355
concerning your servant, concerning his house.

486
00:25:30.615 --> 00:25:32.235
And do as you have spoken,

487
00:25:33.015 --> 00:25:37.755
and your name will be magnified forever, saying, the Lord

488
00:25:37.755 --> 00:25:39.075
of hosts is God over Israel.

489
00:25:39.255 --> 00:25:41.435
The house of your servant David will be established

490
00:25:41.435 --> 00:25:44.315
before you for you, oh Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,

491
00:25:44.425 --> 00:25:47.115
have made this revelation to your servant saying,

492
00:25:47.275 --> 00:25:48.515
I will build you a house.

493
00:25:49.225 --> 00:25:51.115
Therefore, your servant has found courage

494
00:25:51.175 --> 00:25:52.715
to pray this prayer to you.

495
00:25:54.065 --> 00:25:57.485
And now, oh Lord God, you are God and your words are true.

496
00:25:57.625 --> 00:25:59.765
And you've promised this good thing to your servant.

497
00:26:01.145 --> 00:26:03.285
Now, therefore, may it please you to bless the house

498
00:26:03.285 --> 00:26:05.045
of your servant so that it may continue forever

499
00:26:05.225 --> 00:26:07.645
before you, for you, oh Lord God,

500
00:26:07.645 --> 00:26:09.325
have spoken with your blessing.

501
00:26:09.325 --> 00:26:12.045
Shall the house of your servant be blessed forever?

502
00:26:13.225 --> 00:26:17.365
Is that not worship, just the whole time?

503
00:26:17.755 --> 00:26:19.085
Worship. Worship.

504
00:26:19.475 --> 00:26:22.405
It's a beautiful, powerful prayer of gratitude,

505
00:26:22.605 --> 00:26:24.285
thanksgiving and praise.

506
00:26:24.465 --> 00:26:28.605
Notice David moved from the throne room to the prayer room.

507
00:26:31.045 --> 00:26:32.935
What he used to think, man, this isn't good enough

508
00:26:32.935 --> 00:26:34.455
for the the ark, the tent.

509
00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:36.015
I'm in the house of cedar.

510
00:26:36.315 --> 00:26:38.255
He said, no, no, that's where I want to be.

511
00:26:38.415 --> 00:26:40.375
I wanna be with God. I wanna go meet with God.

512
00:26:40.495 --> 00:26:43.445
I don't care where it is. I'm gonna meet with him.

513
00:26:44.665 --> 00:26:48.345
Israel's greatest king recognized his place

514
00:26:49.925 --> 00:26:52.425
As he bowed before the true king.

515
00:26:56.895 --> 00:26:59.275
And we see David's humility all over this, don't we?

516
00:27:00.775 --> 00:27:02.915
He calls himself servant of God over and over again.

517
00:27:02.915 --> 00:27:05.715
But look at verse 18. Who am I? Oh Lord God.

518
00:27:05.985 --> 00:27:08.035
What is my house that you've brought me this far?

519
00:27:09.445 --> 00:27:14.135
Like just blatant humility saying, God, who me? Really?

520
00:27:16.515 --> 00:27:18.745
Verse 20, what more can David say to you?

521
00:27:18.745 --> 00:27:20.225
You know you're serving, oh God, like God,

522
00:27:20.225 --> 00:27:21.345
you know the deepest part of me,

523
00:27:21.345 --> 00:27:23.105
and yet you still allow me to pray to you really?

524
00:27:24.765 --> 00:27:28.585
And on and on. You did this God, you did this, you did that.

525
00:27:28.655 --> 00:27:33.265
There's humility all over this as he worshiped in response.

526
00:27:33.285 --> 00:27:35.825
And it was in response to what? To God's character.

527
00:27:35.825 --> 00:27:37.305
Verse 22, you are great.

528
00:27:37.805 --> 00:27:39.505
Oh Lord God, there is none like you.

529
00:27:39.505 --> 00:27:42.985
There's no God besides you. That's nearly word for word.

530
00:27:42.985 --> 00:27:46.305
If you remember months ago, one Samuel two, Hannah,

531
00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:50.145
she prays this prayer so similarly,

532
00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:52.265
there is none holy like the Lord.

533
00:27:52.415 --> 00:27:55.505
There's none besides you. There's no rock like our God.

534
00:27:56.055 --> 00:27:58.665
Like this is just character and character

535
00:27:58.765 --> 00:28:00.465
and character who our God is.

536
00:28:02.035 --> 00:28:05.695
That's why David praises his God.

537
00:28:08.385 --> 00:28:09.885
Here's the point. Here's what he was doing.

538
00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:14.025
He was declaring his faith in this.

539
00:28:14.795 --> 00:28:18.105
David was declaring his faith.

540
00:28:20.895 --> 00:28:24.955
He was responding to who God is responding to, all

541
00:28:24.955 --> 00:28:27.475
that God had done, all that God had promised to do.

542
00:28:27.475 --> 00:28:29.075
And David looks to God

543
00:28:29.075 --> 00:28:32.275
and says, God, I believe you God,

544
00:28:32.475 --> 00:28:35.755
I believe I I I have faith that you are who you say you are.

545
00:28:35.835 --> 00:28:37.715
I have faith that you did what you did

546
00:28:37.895 --> 00:28:39.995
and will do what you promised you will do.

547
00:28:40.095 --> 00:28:44.315
God, I believe. Now you can also imagine

548
00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:49.225
David saying, Hey God, I know I had to wait 20 years

549
00:28:49.245 --> 00:28:54.125
for this moment, but I believe you because I can look back

550
00:28:54.145 --> 00:28:55.525
and I can see how good you were

551
00:28:55.525 --> 00:28:56.645
to me through the whole process.

552
00:28:56.925 --> 00:28:59.765
I can see how you worked and brought me to this place.

553
00:28:59.765 --> 00:29:01.165
And so I've placed my faith in you.

554
00:29:01.365 --> 00:29:02.925
I placed my faith in your promises.

555
00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:07.705
You See how this changed David?

556
00:29:08.085 --> 00:29:11.425
See how he responded to God's blessing

557
00:29:11.425 --> 00:29:13.185
of the covenant in his life?

558
00:29:16.735 --> 00:29:21.495
I believe that God has worked similarly in those of us

559
00:29:21.495 --> 00:29:23.295
who are believers even today.

560
00:29:25.105 --> 00:29:26.565
And I think there's a response.

561
00:29:26.685 --> 00:29:29.525
I think there's two responses that we should give

562
00:29:30.825 --> 00:29:34.405
to God's faithful goodness in our lives as well.

563
00:29:34.505 --> 00:29:38.985
Here's the first one, humbly rest in God's grace.

564
00:29:41.565 --> 00:29:45.985
How do we respond to God's salvation, his covenant of

565
00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:48.145
of eternal rest in him?

566
00:29:48.165 --> 00:29:52.825
How do we respond? First, we humbly rest in God's grace.

567
00:29:55.505 --> 00:29:57.235
What did God see? Or what did David see?

568
00:29:57.235 --> 00:30:00.155
David saw God as good and faithful

569
00:30:00.415 --> 00:30:04.615
and he rested in that we ought

570
00:30:04.615 --> 00:30:06.775
to see God the same way.

571
00:30:08.965 --> 00:30:10.125
I mean, just think about how he's

572
00:30:10.125 --> 00:30:11.285
been faithful to you over the years.

573
00:30:13.525 --> 00:30:15.595
Think of the specific ways he's been faithful.

574
00:30:16.195 --> 00:30:19.035
Recount one by one, the blessings of God.

575
00:30:20.615 --> 00:30:24.305
You know that word recount like we, we kind of use it,

576
00:30:25.145 --> 00:30:26.265
recount what it means.

577
00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:29.265
Recount. That means you go back and you number them 1, 2, 3,

578
00:30:29.325 --> 00:30:31.665
and you go and recount 'em again and recount 'em again.

579
00:30:31.815 --> 00:30:34.265
This is how God was faithful. This was how God was faithful.

580
00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:36.625
You just keep going over and over and over

581
00:30:36.645 --> 00:30:39.025
and over to remind yourself

582
00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:41.825
of God's faithfulness.

583
00:30:43.695 --> 00:30:45.675
And as you do that, you get assurance.

584
00:30:45.815 --> 00:30:48.795
You take heart in how he's been a good promise,

585
00:30:48.795 --> 00:30:51.635
keeping God over and over and over again.

586
00:30:51.655 --> 00:30:54.275
So you think about his blessings, you think about

587
00:30:54.275 --> 00:30:55.795
how he's been good to you, yes.

588
00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:57.315
But then primarily

589
00:30:58.855 --> 00:31:02.025
You Rest in God's grace for salvation.

590
00:31:04.045 --> 00:31:06.465
You rest with assurance that the life, death,

591
00:31:06.465 --> 00:31:09.105
and resurrection of Jesus in your place, like Ephesians two

592
00:31:09.695 --> 00:31:11.945
says so well, for by grace,

593
00:31:13.005 --> 00:31:15.305
you have been saved through faith.

594
00:31:15.305 --> 00:31:16.305
And it's not your own doing.

595
00:31:16.365 --> 00:31:21.265
It is the gift of God, not a result of works

596
00:31:21.565 --> 00:31:23.545
so that no one may boast.

597
00:31:23.985 --> 00:31:24.985
I don't deserve it.

598
00:31:27.405 --> 00:31:30.045
I could not earn it, which is what makes

599
00:31:30.265 --> 00:31:32.045
by definition a gift.

600
00:31:32.495 --> 00:31:34.805
Grace, you don't deserve a gift.

601
00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:37.725
You're given a gift because you are loved.

602
00:31:40.955 --> 00:31:45.775
That's the truth of this, that you can rest in the grace

603
00:31:45.795 --> 00:31:47.095
of God for you.

604
00:31:47.315 --> 00:31:50.975
You can be assured in the grace of God for you.

605
00:31:51.235 --> 00:31:53.775
And that should make you and me

606
00:31:53.775 --> 00:31:56.975
and us the most humble people on the face of the planet.

607
00:31:59.795 --> 00:32:04.385
Remember what David started with? Verse 18, who am I?

608
00:32:04.645 --> 00:32:07.835
Oh God, What?

609
00:32:07.835 --> 00:32:09.675
What is my house that you would bring me this far?

610
00:32:09.705 --> 00:32:10.875
That you would do this in my life?

611
00:32:10.935 --> 00:32:13.075
Who am I God that you would do that?

612
00:32:13.255 --> 00:32:16.635
Should that not be our response to God's amazing grace?

613
00:32:17.675 --> 00:32:19.575
Should that not be the way we respond?

614
00:32:19.575 --> 00:32:20.935
Like just stunned awe

615
00:32:20.935 --> 00:32:24.655
that God would look at a sinner like you, a sinner like me,

616
00:32:24.715 --> 00:32:26.935
and he would say, I want you to be a part of my family.

617
00:32:27.035 --> 00:32:28.255
You're enemies right now,

618
00:32:28.355 --> 00:32:31.215
but I'm gonna die for you so you can be with me forever.

619
00:32:31.515 --> 00:32:33.775
Should that not be just like God? Who am I?

620
00:32:36.615 --> 00:32:38.375
I don't deserve that. I deserve wrath

621
00:32:38.435 --> 00:32:40.645
and you chose to love me instead.

622
00:32:41.665 --> 00:32:43.725
So amazing His grace.

623
00:32:48.605 --> 00:32:52.925
And the more we remember that the more we rest

624
00:32:53.785 --> 00:32:56.605
in that grace, the more it should lead us

625
00:32:56.665 --> 00:32:58.005
to respond like David did

626
00:32:58.185 --> 00:33:01.525
and loudly rejoice in God's character.

627
00:33:04.425 --> 00:33:07.685
We humbly rest in God's grace for us,

628
00:33:08.105 --> 00:33:10.445
and we in return loudly,

629
00:33:11.125 --> 00:33:14.405
rejoice in his character, right?

630
00:33:14.465 --> 00:33:18.225
The bulk of his prayer was praise.

631
00:33:20.185 --> 00:33:22.165
It was like, God, thank you for this. Thank you for that.

632
00:33:22.225 --> 00:33:23.965
You did this. You did that. You did that.

633
00:33:23.995 --> 00:33:25.725
Just praising God over and over and over.

634
00:33:25.745 --> 00:33:28.165
That's what it was. I love this quote I found this week.

635
00:33:28.575 --> 00:33:31.605
Grace should always leave us speechless,

636
00:33:33.065 --> 00:33:34.195
Then make us speak.

637
00:33:37.305 --> 00:33:39.295
Grace should always leave us speechless.

638
00:33:39.305 --> 00:33:41.935
We're just stunned by the grace of God, who am I

639
00:33:42.045 --> 00:33:44.375
that you would save me a sinner like that?

640
00:33:44.555 --> 00:33:47.815
Who am I? Speechless, face first, humbled

641
00:33:47.815 --> 00:33:51.595
before the Lord, which should lead us

642
00:33:51.595 --> 00:33:53.235
to speak in response.

643
00:33:56.055 --> 00:33:59.105
'cause think about it. How can we not

644
00:33:59.985 --> 00:34:04.185
proclaim the grace and glory and goodness and mercy

645
00:34:04.645 --> 00:34:07.385
and majesty and power of our great God

646
00:34:07.385 --> 00:34:12.195
and Savior Jesus Christ like it should be on our

647
00:34:12.265 --> 00:34:16.675
lips, in our homes, in our schools, in our workplaces,

648
00:34:16.855 --> 00:34:19.955
in the public square, even amongst threats at our life.

649
00:34:20.055 --> 00:34:24.115
It should be on our lips because he is worthy of it.

650
00:34:25.145 --> 00:34:27.395
He's worthy of us declaring the glory

651
00:34:27.575 --> 00:34:29.595
and the character of our God.

652
00:34:29.855 --> 00:34:33.195
I'm so proud of our high school seniors this very week.

653
00:34:33.305 --> 00:34:34.835
They've been planning this for a couple weeks

654
00:34:34.835 --> 00:34:37.115
because our college students did it a few weeks ago.

655
00:34:37.255 --> 00:34:38.675
So our high school students are like, let's do it too.

656
00:34:38.735 --> 00:34:42.155
And so they got up every morning at 5:00 AM gathered back

657
00:34:42.155 --> 00:34:43.955
there and said, we are going to pray

658
00:34:44.025 --> 00:34:45.755
that God would give us boldness like

659
00:34:45.755 --> 00:34:46.875
acts, we're gonna give, pray.

660
00:34:46.975 --> 00:34:48.715
God give us boldness. We're gonna pray.

661
00:34:48.805 --> 00:34:49.995
We're gonna worship together.

662
00:34:50.085 --> 00:34:51.675
We're gonna ask God for specific things,

663
00:34:51.695 --> 00:34:53.355
and we're gonna go out to our schools

664
00:34:53.535 --> 00:34:55.035
and to our neighborhoods and we're gonna

665
00:34:55.035 --> 00:34:56.595
declare the glory of God.

666
00:34:56.615 --> 00:34:57.395
And you know what? They did it.

667
00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:58.555
They were sharing their faith.

668
00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:00.355
They were talking to friends in class.

669
00:35:00.505 --> 00:35:02.915
They were inviting people to church left and right,

670
00:35:03.135 --> 00:35:05.235
and they did it unashamedly.

671
00:35:06.935 --> 00:35:07.675
Praise God.

672
00:35:11.855 --> 00:35:13.155
And I got to pray with him a couple times.

673
00:35:13.295 --> 00:35:14.915
And you know what? We clap for that.

674
00:35:15.095 --> 00:35:16.435
But should that not challenge us

675
00:35:20.705 --> 00:35:23.395
sitting there convicted by these 17, 18 year olds,

676
00:35:23.745 --> 00:35:26.875
they're just like, boy, they're so far beyond me right now.

677
00:35:31.565 --> 00:35:33.495
They were living out one Timothy four 12.

678
00:35:33.595 --> 00:35:35.255
Let no one despise you for your youth,

679
00:35:35.315 --> 00:35:38.685
but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct

680
00:35:38.785 --> 00:35:40.445
and love and faith in purity.

681
00:35:42.685 --> 00:35:44.655
College students, young adults did it a couple weeks ago,

682
00:35:44.655 --> 00:35:47.295
did it again this week in some ways, and and they did it.

683
00:35:47.315 --> 00:35:49.895
And the students did it this week. Why?

684
00:35:49.895 --> 00:35:53.255
Because they are so grateful for who God is

685
00:35:53.395 --> 00:35:55.655
and for what he has done that they can't help

686
00:35:55.755 --> 00:35:58.295
but speak boldly and loudly

687
00:35:58.295 --> 00:35:59.695
because they want everybody to know,

688
00:36:01.755 --> 00:36:03.015
should we not be the same way?

689
00:36:04.565 --> 00:36:08.185
Should we not rest in the grace of our savior

690
00:36:09.765 --> 00:36:12.545
and rejoice in the character of our king,

691
00:36:16.175 --> 00:36:17.865
like because he's been faithful to us,

692
00:36:18.255 --> 00:36:20.825
because he has never left us.

693
00:36:20.855 --> 00:36:23.625
He's kept his promises in every way he sent his son

694
00:36:23.625 --> 00:36:26.105
to save us, and we're staking our lives on that truth

695
00:36:26.135 --> 00:36:27.505
because of all of that.

696
00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:28.985
Let's be bold for him.

697
00:36:32.395 --> 00:36:36.185
Let's in here, of course, yes, let's sing loudly in here

698
00:36:36.185 --> 00:36:37.265
because he's worthy of it.

699
00:36:37.365 --> 00:36:39.545
But let's shout loudly out there

700
00:36:39.545 --> 00:36:41.945
because people need to hear who our God is

701
00:36:44.645 --> 00:36:47.225
not just here, but to the ends of the earth.

702
00:36:47.225 --> 00:36:51.265
Like you heard earlier, he's worthy,

703
00:36:51.695 --> 00:36:54.705
he's deserving of every tribe, tongue, nation, language,

704
00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:59.945
people, group declaring that same glory of David's

705
00:37:00.965 --> 00:37:04.905
prayer, our prayer, our songs,

706
00:37:05.405 --> 00:37:10.385
our gospel message, that king is worthy of us taking that

707
00:37:10.445 --> 00:37:11.465
to every person.

708
00:37:14.885 --> 00:37:16.665
So I want us to just take some time to reflect

709
00:37:16.665 --> 00:37:18.385
as the worship team comes back out.

710
00:37:24.545 --> 00:37:25.825
A couple things to reflect on.

711
00:37:32.745 --> 00:37:35.105
I asked the question earlier, do you believe,

712
00:37:35.375 --> 00:37:36.585
have you placed your faith?

713
00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.705
And I'm under, no,

714
00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:49.145
I'm not ignorant of the fact that there's enough people

715
00:37:49.145 --> 00:37:51.665
here, that there's at least a few

716
00:37:55.165 --> 00:37:56.465
who, if you're honest with yourself

717
00:37:56.465 --> 00:37:57.545
right now, would say, Nope.

718
00:37:58.755 --> 00:38:01.085
Just kind of feeling this out. Not sure about it all.

719
00:38:02.115 --> 00:38:03.845
It's okay. We're glad you're here,

720
00:38:05.985 --> 00:38:07.205
but I'm good.

721
00:38:07.205 --> 00:38:09.005
Again, gonna ask the question, do you believe,

722
00:38:09.235 --> 00:38:11.165
have you placed your faith in Jesus?

723
00:38:12.785 --> 00:38:14.085
And you could have been in church your whole life

724
00:38:14.465 --> 00:38:15.525
and you've just played a game

725
00:38:15.765 --> 00:38:18.445
religiously And you're exhausted?

726
00:38:21.155 --> 00:38:22.925
Stop striving, trust Jesus.

727
00:38:25.745 --> 00:38:28.645
And we'll have men and women along the sides in here as soon

728
00:38:28.645 --> 00:38:30.605
as we start to sing and just slip outta your seat.

729
00:38:30.605 --> 00:38:32.245
If you wanna talk to somebody about that, you got questions

730
00:38:32.245 --> 00:38:34.645
about that, just go right over there, right over there,

731
00:38:35.745 --> 00:38:37.565
and just go say, Hey, I, I don't know about this.

732
00:38:37.785 --> 00:38:40.045
I'm not sure, or I just need some help

733
00:38:40.175 --> 00:38:41.205
kinda processing through that.

734
00:38:41.205 --> 00:38:42.405
You can do it right where you sit of course,

735
00:38:42.505 --> 00:38:43.845
but just need some help with that.

736
00:38:44.395 --> 00:38:45.805
We'd love to talk with you about those things.

737
00:38:48.425 --> 00:38:51.725
But also just as we all kind of think like David,

738
00:38:51.725 --> 00:38:53.485
David went from the throne room to the prayer room,

739
00:38:53.485 --> 00:38:55.605
let's all just sort of go to that prayer room right now

740
00:38:59.425 --> 00:39:04.205
and reflect on the goodness of God, the faithfulness of God,

741
00:39:07.065 --> 00:39:11.325
how he's been faithful to you, how he has never left you,

742
00:39:11.375 --> 00:39:12.645
never forsaken you.

743
00:39:13.425 --> 00:39:18.085
How he has provided salvation through Jesus Christ for you.

744
00:39:20.705 --> 00:39:24.125
And just let that stir an affection

745
00:39:24.145 --> 00:39:26.525
for him in a new way today.

746
00:39:32.395 --> 00:39:36.085
That we're grateful. God, we are grateful, Lord I,

747
00:39:36.125 --> 00:39:38.845
I pray on behalf of all of us right now,

748
00:39:40.145 --> 00:39:41.565
we don't even have the words to say

749
00:39:45.185 --> 00:39:48.285
Enough to say thank you adequately.

750
00:39:53.025 --> 00:39:55.845
So we just give you praise. We give you our lives.

751
00:39:58.005 --> 00:39:59.925
Whatever you call us to, no matter the cost,

752
00:40:02.835 --> 00:40:04.645
picking up our cross, following you

753
00:40:05.425 --> 00:40:06.685
and saying, Jesus, you're worth it.

754
00:40:08.235 --> 00:40:12.165
Help us. Take one baby, step that direction today.

755
00:40:13.465 --> 00:40:15.645
In Jesus' name, amen.

756
00:40:15.665 --> 00:40:17.005
If you're able, let's stand together

757
00:40:17.225 --> 00:40:20.245
and let's sing in gratitude for who he is

758
00:40:20.245 --> 00:40:20.845
and what he's done.
