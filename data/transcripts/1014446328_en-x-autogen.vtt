1
00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:01.725
This is my friend Chris Cross.

2
00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:03.685
That is his name. Yes.

3
00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:08.125
And we get to hear from him tonight,

4
00:00:09.305 --> 00:00:11.245
the same format as the last two weeks.

5
00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:14.965
We have had, uh, Trevor, Al, Dan Lee part.

6
00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:18.965
Now Chris gets to share his testimony, teach a little bit,

7
00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:21.445
and then we'll do the same questions we asked the other two

8
00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:22.805
guys just to keep consistent.

9
00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:26.765
Uh, so I think you can be looking forward to this.

10
00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:29.245
Again, let me just remind you of the schedule, uh,

11
00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:30.325
over the next couple weeks.

12
00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:32.965
If you have any concerns about any of them, come to us

13
00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:35.085
as elders, talk to them as individuals as well.

14
00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:36.645
Just love to kind

15
00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.845
of answer any questions you would have if you have some,

16
00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:42.125
but also, uh, we're looking to announce a vote soon

17
00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:44.805
and then move forward in the process towards that.

18
00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:46.685
And again, you're not voting for each

19
00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:49.165
of them, one of them, right?

20
00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:50.845
You're, you're voting for all of them, yes

21
00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:54.285
or no, affirmative, yes or no, not pick your favorite.

22
00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:56.805
So just because Dan had

23
00:00:57.905 --> 00:00:59.805
charts last week doesn't mean like

24
00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:01.235
Vote for Dan. No.

25
00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:02.885
Chart, no.

26
00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:04.605
So, uh, we believe all three are called

27
00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:05.845
by God towards this church.

28
00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:06.685
So I'm gonna pray for you, Chris,

29
00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:07.525
then you let you get going.

30
00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:10.285
Lord, thank you for the opportunity to be together tonight

31
00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:13.325
to, uh, just celebrate your work and our lives.

32
00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:16.285
Get to know one another fellowship around the tables,

33
00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:20.345
but also to, uh, hear what you've done in Chris's life

34
00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:23.785
and walk together as a church toward discerning

35
00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:26.105
what you have for us and for him and his family.

36
00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:29.185
Thank you for him, for Maura, thank you for their kids

37
00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:32.345
and what you've done to bring them to this point.

38
00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:34.665
And we trust you. Lead us going forward.

39
00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:36.625
Encourage us with your word

40
00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:38.785
and with his story for your glory.

41
00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:40.065
In Jesus' name. Amen.

42
00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:43.345
Alright, thank you, John. Um, wow.

43
00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:47.225
So I, I know a lot of you already very well, um,

44
00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:49.225
but there's several in here that I, I don't know at all.

45
00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:50.545
And so I look forward

46
00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:51.865
to getting to know you a little bit more.

47
00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.865
Um, hopefully me getting to share my story

48
00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.225
lets you know a little bit about me.

49
00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:01.385
And, um, more than anything, what God has done in my life,

50
00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:04.865
um, stories are an incredible thing that we get to share.

51
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.705
Uh, we all have stories about God has, uh, rescued us,

52
00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:10.545
impacted our lives, changed us.

53
00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:12.105
And so it's fun that we get

54
00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:13.505
to share these stories with one another.

55
00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:17.625
Uh, a little bit about my background. I am from Edmond.

56
00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:21.145
I grew up here. Um, I grew up in Henderson Hills, um,

57
00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:23.465
from birth, I mean, just a couple of days

58
00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:25.305
after I was born, my parents

59
00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:28.625
carried me into a green shag carpeted room

60
00:02:28.755 --> 00:02:31.665
where I spent the next 18 years of my childhood.

61
00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:33.745
And, um, growing up

62
00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:39.145
and, uh, learning about who Jesus is, learning the word

63
00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:43.345
learning, uh, how to serve in a church, how to be a part

64
00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:45.585
of community, um, learned a lot

65
00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:47.425
of other really great things at Henderson Hills,

66
00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:49.585
like Gorilla Mangun.

67
00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:53.065
Does anyone know what that is? Any, any youth groupers? Yep.

68
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:58.065
Um, I learned about pink sequin dresses at Christmas time

69
00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:01.365
and giant Christmas trees with singing heads in them.

70
00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.245
Any of those, I think there were like some of y'all

71
00:03:04.245 --> 00:03:05.765
that were the singing heads in the

72
00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:07.085
Christmas tree, if I remember right.

73
00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:10.565
Um, and then other great things that we, I got

74
00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.405
to learn at this church, like, um,

75
00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:13.645
man is the three part being.

76
00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:15.405
We talked about that a lot.

77
00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:19.805
Uh, know God, but God and God's church, God's way.

78
00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:21.045
These are all things that are part

79
00:03:21.045 --> 00:03:23.645
of my heritage growing up here at Henderson Hills.

80
00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:28.405
And this has been a wonderful place to be raised in, in,

81
00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:29.965
in the church and God's word.

82
00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:33.965
And God has done incredible things through, uh,

83
00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:35.645
the people at this church.

84
00:03:36.385 --> 00:03:40.045
In fact, it's, it's, um, it's really sweet to be

85
00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:43.965
where I'm at today, talking to you about shepherding.

86
00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:45.325
When I look around this room

87
00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:46.925
and I see people that have shepherded me

88
00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:50.085
so well growing up here, um, how cool

89
00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:51.605
that God does that through his church.

90
00:03:51.675 --> 00:03:56.045
That, um, LaDonna, she always likes to joke about

91
00:03:56.045 --> 00:03:57.725
how she changed my diapers in the nursery,

92
00:03:57.725 --> 00:03:58.965
and she doesn't let me forget that.

93
00:03:59.185 --> 00:04:02.205
But we all have, like, you all have served me,

94
00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:04.525
and now I get to serve you.

95
00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:05.805
It's, it's really beautiful

96
00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:07.405
that God creates his church that way.

97
00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:10.085
Um, so growing up,

98
00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:14.685
my family wasn't the most conventional, you could say.

99
00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:17.525
My mom and dad, they divorced when I was three.

100
00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:22.525
Um, I grew up in a blended family with a stepmom

101
00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:24.405
and, uh, three step siblings.

102
00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:28.165
And then my brother and I, we split split time spending, uh,

103
00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:30.245
weekends and summers at my mom's house

104
00:04:30.275 --> 00:04:31.485
with my mom and my stepdad.

105
00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:34.355
Uh, and while there's a lot

106
00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:37.355
of challenges growing up in a blended family, um,

107
00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:39.515
unique challenges that come along with that,

108
00:04:39.535 --> 00:04:42.475
it was also a very, uh, sweet season of life.

109
00:04:42.755 --> 00:04:45.115
I, I loved growing up in our house with five siblings.

110
00:04:45.775 --> 00:04:48.235
Um, all the trouble that we would get into as kids.

111
00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:53.875
My, my dad did a great job trying to teach us scripture, uh,

112
00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:57.675
teach us wisdom, um, try to share, uh, knowledge

113
00:04:57.675 --> 00:04:59.395
with us about how to avoid mistakes

114
00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:00.435
that he had made in life.

115
00:05:00.695 --> 00:05:02.595
Um, so we had a really good

116
00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:04.955
solid foundation in the word growing up,

117
00:05:05.295 --> 00:05:07.115
and I'm very thankful for that.

118
00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:09.875
Uh, we were very involved in the church.

119
00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:12.915
We are here all the time. Uh, played a lot of hide

120
00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:15.395
and seek in the pews during choir practices.

121
00:05:15.695 --> 00:05:17.395
Um, some of y'all have that experience.

122
00:05:17.505 --> 00:05:19.835
It's a very unique and fun experience if you ever,

123
00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:21.435
uh, grow up in the church.

124
00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:23.595
Um, so a lot of great,

125
00:05:23.765 --> 00:05:25.475
great memories from that season of life.

126
00:05:26.415 --> 00:05:29.825
When I was seven years old, uh, God saved my life.

127
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:34.985
Uh, Jesus, um, awakened my heart to, um,

128
00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:36.745
know who he was.

129
00:05:36.885 --> 00:05:39.145
My spirit became alive and he saved me.

130
00:05:39.765 --> 00:05:43.825
Uh, I recognized I needed a sinner, and my only hope

131
00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:48.385
and life was Jesus, um, because he had done it all for me.

132
00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:49.545
So I'm very thankful

133
00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:52.145
that he saved my life at seven years old.

134
00:05:52.805 --> 00:05:55.545
Uh, and I was baptized here at the church shortly

135
00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:56.985
after that by one of our elders.

136
00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:04.035
So when I was 13, so fast forward a little bit,

137
00:06:05.005 --> 00:06:06.865
uh, I went through one of the hardest years

138
00:06:06.885 --> 00:06:08.265
of my life at 13,

139
00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:12.665
and it was a year where, um, I really got to know

140
00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:14.425
how destructive sin could be.

141
00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:20.225
So during my 13th year, my second family,

142
00:06:20.295 --> 00:06:23.105
this blended family that I got to grow up in, um,

143
00:06:23.325 --> 00:06:27.345
was torn apart, very much like my first family had been.

144
00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:31.425
Unfortunately, sin had a recurring pattern in our family,

145
00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:36.835
and it led to my dad and my stepmom divorcing.

146
00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:39.355
And suddenly half

147
00:06:39.355 --> 00:06:42.435
of my siblings were no longer in my home during that time.

148
00:06:44.015 --> 00:06:47.595
On top of that, um, shortly

149
00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:51.465
while this was going on, um, one of my brother

150
00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:55.305
and i's best friends decided his life, um,

151
00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:57.425
well not decided, was deceived.

152
00:06:57.425 --> 00:07:00.825
And to think his his life wasn't worth it anything anymore.

153
00:07:01.085 --> 00:07:03.385
And unfortunately, he took his own life

154
00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:04.905
that year at 13 years old.

155
00:07:07.545 --> 00:07:11.455
So, needless to say, during that year, I,

156
00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:14.735
my support system for my family was in shambles

157
00:07:16.065 --> 00:07:17.725
and it was lonely,

158
00:07:17.825 --> 00:07:20.525
and I didn't really know how to make sense of

159
00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:23.125
what was going on or all around me.

160
00:07:23.905 --> 00:07:27.045
Um, I remember a lot of sleepless nights not being able

161
00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:30.805
to sleep, hearing my dad weeping in the next room, um,

162
00:07:30.945 --> 00:07:32.885
as he's dealing with his own heartbreak

163
00:07:33.265 --> 00:07:36.005
and, uh, crying out to the Lord.

164
00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:41.775
Just trying to know why this is happening is,

165
00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:44.375
um, is there any future in this?

166
00:07:44.675 --> 00:07:47.615
Not even know how to do deal with the next, next day.

167
00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:53.665
And God, man, he, he showed up in that year.

168
00:07:54.045 --> 00:07:55.425
Um, when my,

169
00:07:57.015 --> 00:08:01.665
when my parents were emotionally unavailable, God showed up

170
00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:04.505
and it was hard.

171
00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:05.905
But man, what a sweet season,

172
00:08:05.905 --> 00:08:08.225
because I got to, I got to lean into

173
00:08:09.175 --> 00:08:12.145
that relationship in a way that I probably wouldn't have at

174
00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:15.115
that age without those other trials.

175
00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:17.835
Um, he showed me how real

176
00:08:17.835 --> 00:08:21.355
and present he is when no one else in in life was really

177
00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:23.195
present, um, at that time.

178
00:08:24.055 --> 00:08:27.875
And the relationship deepened very quickly, very fast,

179
00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:30.035
and became very real because of that.

180
00:08:31.735 --> 00:08:33.435
So moving forward, I, um,

181
00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.395
graduated from high school Saints Pride.

182
00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:40.035
Um, and then I went up to Oklahoma State to go to college.

183
00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:45.755
And man, just like most young college students, my freshman

184
00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:49.275
and sophomore year, um, I did what most college students do.

185
00:08:49.475 --> 00:08:50.635
I live for myself.

186
00:08:50.935 --> 00:08:55.285
And, uh, while I professed, uh, who my savior was,

187
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.645
while I was still a disciple, I didn't act like it.

188
00:08:58.265 --> 00:09:02.125
Um, I pursued things that I was interested in, pursued

189
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:05.925
and things that were, uh, instantly gratifying for me.

190
00:09:07.215 --> 00:09:08.955
Dating relationships are very selfish.

191
00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.155
All of the, you know, all of the things that you do going

192
00:09:11.155 --> 00:09:12.595
through that time of life.

193
00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:15.835
And, uh, I had to learn a lot from it.

194
00:09:15.975 --> 00:09:18.435
God taught me a lot through that season of life as well.

195
00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:21.875
Um, during that season, it was more about recognizing him

196
00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:23.875
as, as Lord and as king,

197
00:09:23.895 --> 00:09:25.395
and am I going to actually submit

198
00:09:25.395 --> 00:09:26.755
to his authority in my life?

199
00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:29.875
And the way he did that was through the church.

200
00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:32.595
He did that through accountability of Christian brothers,

201
00:09:33.135 --> 00:09:36.395
um, some of whom I'm very still very close with today.

202
00:09:36.395 --> 00:09:38.635
Jacob Stockton was one of my roommates in college,

203
00:09:39.375 --> 00:09:41.595
and he was one of those that held me accountable.

204
00:09:41.595 --> 00:09:43.635
And he goes to church here, uh, today,

205
00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:46.755
but also getting involved in a church locally in Stillwater.

206
00:09:47.135 --> 00:09:48.195
Um, God used that.

207
00:09:48.335 --> 00:09:52.155
So by serving in a church, being surrounded in a community

208
00:09:52.155 --> 00:09:55.795
by older believers, uh, that could hold me accountable

209
00:09:55.815 --> 00:09:58.475
and really wake me up to, are you going to live the life

210
00:09:58.475 --> 00:10:01.875
that you profess, uh, that you believe, um,

211
00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:05.555
really caused me to mature, start to mature anyways.

212
00:10:05.975 --> 00:10:09.035
And it's a good thing because my junior year, uh,

213
00:10:09.295 --> 00:10:12.075
of college, I started dating my wife Mara.

214
00:10:12.655 --> 00:10:15.715
And man, I'm glad I was a little bit more mature my junior

215
00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:17.955
year than I was my freshman or sophomore year,

216
00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:20.315
because when you have a beautiful

217
00:10:21.015 --> 00:10:23.435
spirit led purposeful woman like Mara,

218
00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:25.195
um, you don't wanna mess that up.

219
00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:30.275
And God has used this woman in incredible ways in my life

220
00:10:30.295 --> 00:10:31.795
to teach me so much.

221
00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:33.755
And I'm so thankful for Mara.

222
00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:37.835
And as, um, as we grew up together

223
00:10:38.215 --> 00:10:41.035
and, uh, fell deeper in love with each other

224
00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:44.155
and pursued Christ together, we got married shortly

225
00:10:44.205 --> 00:10:45.315
after college.

226
00:10:46.485 --> 00:10:48.185
Um, basically right

227
00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:50.545
after graduating, graduating college, we got married.

228
00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:53.825
And marriage has been an incredibly

229
00:10:54.465 --> 00:10:56.265
refining experience for me.

230
00:10:57.085 --> 00:11:00.305
Um, God has used marriage in incredible ways.

231
00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:04.345
I've got to learn, uh, more about unconditional love

232
00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:06.785
from being married to her.

233
00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:11.665
Uh, the joys of just sharing your life with someone, um,

234
00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:16.265
the, the grease and the good times with her, uh,

235
00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:18.505
has taught me the joy of, um,

236
00:11:18.535 --> 00:11:20.225
serving rather than being served.

237
00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:24.025
This woman serves incredibly well.

238
00:11:24.045 --> 00:11:26.465
If you have the blessing of knowing Mara, you know,

239
00:11:26.765 --> 00:11:28.585
you've been served by her in some way.

240
00:11:30.255 --> 00:11:33.795
Um, but God also taught me a lot about forgiveness, uh,

241
00:11:34.055 --> 00:11:38.075
by being married to, to Mara and his grace shown in Mara.

242
00:11:38.775 --> 00:11:43.015
Um, so when I was,

243
00:11:43.605 --> 00:11:47.735
when I was 13, going back to that year, um, one

244
00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:49.655
of the consequences that came out of

245
00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:52.575
that year is I became addicted to pornography.

246
00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:57.765
Um, it was one of those vices that I think at the time,

247
00:11:58.265 --> 00:12:02.445
uh, allowed some sense of control of what was happening,

248
00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:05.165
or at least a, a way to escape from

249
00:12:05.165 --> 00:12:07.205
what was happening in, in my life at the time.

250
00:12:08.225 --> 00:12:10.325
And unfortunately, it led to an addiction

251
00:12:10.325 --> 00:12:12.805
that carried on all the way into our marriage.

252
00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:17.255
And in that first year of marriage, I remember very clearly

253
00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:21.855
when the, when the spirit convicted me in a church service

254
00:12:21.965 --> 00:12:25.855
here, um, that it was, it was time to confess to her.

255
00:12:25.855 --> 00:12:27.095
And that needed to happen today.

256
00:12:27.875 --> 00:12:30.635
Um, mart had no idea that

257
00:12:30.635 --> 00:12:32.515
that had been going on in my life at

258
00:12:32.515 --> 00:12:33.795
all up until that point.

259
00:12:36.195 --> 00:12:39.575
So at the end of that service, I remember talking with one

260
00:12:39.575 --> 00:12:40.775
of the elders, um,

261
00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:46.155
and he walked me through what that needs to look like.

262
00:12:46.655 --> 00:12:48.555
Um, but he was also very kind

263
00:12:48.655 --> 00:12:49.995
and shepherded me through that.

264
00:12:50.775 --> 00:12:54.115
Um, but it was also very straightforward that

265
00:12:54.785 --> 00:12:55.965
I'm gonna call you in the morning.

266
00:12:56.265 --> 00:12:57.445
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make sure

267
00:12:57.875 --> 00:13:00.125
that you've told your wife last night.

268
00:13:00.225 --> 00:13:02.845
So there was some accountability that I actually had

269
00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:05.125
to do it, and I did.

270
00:13:05.465 --> 00:13:09.125
And it was, man, one

271
00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.045
of the hardest nights of my life.

272
00:13:11.705 --> 00:13:15.525
Um, and again, I'm so sorry, Mara.

273
00:13:15.825 --> 00:13:20.565
Um, but God has placed an incredible

274
00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:24.765
woman in my life that, um, forgave me,

275
00:13:25.425 --> 00:13:27.005
um, loved me through it,

276
00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:32.485
and took months, years to rebuild that trust.

277
00:13:32.905 --> 00:13:36.085
And God has been faithful, um, through that.

278
00:13:36.785 --> 00:13:40.645
Um, he's healed me, freed me, used confession of sin

279
00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:45.005
to bring freedom from that addiction, which I'm so thankful

280
00:13:45.185 --> 00:13:48.085
to our God for how he works in us and,

281
00:13:48.505 --> 00:13:50.565
and brings freedom, especially when

282
00:13:50.565 --> 00:13:51.725
things are brought into the light.

283
00:13:54.465 --> 00:13:58.725
So that kind of leads, you know, a lot else happened

284
00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:00.925
besides that in our lives.

285
00:14:00.925 --> 00:14:02.525
But that kind of leads to where I'm at today.

286
00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:05.965
Um, have been able to serve in this church

287
00:14:06.105 --> 00:14:09.565
and grow up, um, more and more by serving in this church.

288
00:14:10.185 --> 00:14:14.845
Uh, we have two kids. My daughter, she is nine years old.

289
00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:16.445
Uh, her name is ela,

290
00:14:16.505 --> 00:14:19.205
and my son is six, and his name is Shepherd.

291
00:14:19.745 --> 00:14:22.965
And man, they keep you humble and, uh,

292
00:14:23.105 --> 00:14:25.245
but life is a lot of fun getting to raise them.

293
00:14:25.785 --> 00:14:27.485
We, we love our kids so much.

294
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.645
Um, in fact, we named both of our kids

295
00:14:33.175 --> 00:14:37.325
after terms in the Bible, um, for, for different re reasons.

296
00:14:38.215 --> 00:14:42.525
Sayah, um, our, our prayer for her is that by her,

297
00:14:43.205 --> 00:14:46.005
that she will, um, take moments in life

298
00:14:46.005 --> 00:14:49.285
and have her life be a, a attempted pause and reflect.

299
00:14:49.665 --> 00:14:52.125
And then with our last name, the cross on the cross

300
00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:57.085
of Christ and Shepherd, obviously, um, we hope

301
00:14:57.085 --> 00:14:58.925
that he grows up to be a servant leader

302
00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:03.165
that leads people towards the cross, uh, in his life.

303
00:15:03.905 --> 00:15:06.405
And he's perked up a lot over the last few weeks

304
00:15:06.425 --> 00:15:07.765
as I've been preparing for tonight,

305
00:15:07.765 --> 00:15:08.765
because every time I say shepherd,

306
00:15:08.945 --> 00:15:10.205
he thinks I'm talking to him.

307
00:15:10.205 --> 00:15:11.805
And I'm really just talking

308
00:15:11.825 --> 00:15:13.405
to myself as we've been preparing.

309
00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:17.085
So, with that, let's get into what we're going

310
00:15:17.085 --> 00:15:18.085
to talk about tonight.

311
00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:20.405
And that's gonna be shepherding like we have the last couple

312
00:15:20.425 --> 00:15:22.125
of nights or couple of weeks.

313
00:15:22.695 --> 00:15:24.085
First of all, I wanna say thank you, Trevor

314
00:15:24.345 --> 00:15:27.765
and Dan for how you've walked us

315
00:15:28.005 --> 00:15:30.205
through this topic over the last few weeks.

316
00:15:30.465 --> 00:15:34.045
And also just thank you for like all, all the,

317
00:15:34.045 --> 00:15:36.165
all the moments we've got to have over the last two years.

318
00:15:36.545 --> 00:15:39.365
Um, church, I am, I love these two men

319
00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:42.765
and I am very excited to see what God is calling them to

320
00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:45.685
and, uh, how they lead so well.

321
00:15:46.065 --> 00:15:47.285
So thank you both.

322
00:15:48.625 --> 00:15:51.445
So Dan, Dan taught us last week on

323
00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:55.125
the elder's responsibility to shepherd by leading

324
00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:56.405
and feeding the flock.

325
00:15:56.465 --> 00:15:59.365
And we spent time talking about particularly what

326
00:15:59.365 --> 00:16:02.525
that means, feeding the flock by teaching the word and,

327
00:16:02.585 --> 00:16:04.885
and delivering the word in a way that that nourishes

328
00:16:04.985 --> 00:16:06.325
and equips the body.

329
00:16:07.115 --> 00:16:10.685
Tonight we're gonna talk about these aspects of eldership

330
00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:12.685
where elders are called to

331
00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:15.845
and have the responsibility to care for

332
00:16:16.025 --> 00:16:19.045
and to protect the people of the church, the flock,

333
00:16:20.715 --> 00:16:24.685
essentially what that, what that looks like is leading the,

334
00:16:24.825 --> 00:16:28.885
the people of God to a place of rest by being present

335
00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:31.725
with them, by providing for them,

336
00:16:32.505 --> 00:16:36.165
and by protecting the flock from threats internal

337
00:16:36.345 --> 00:16:37.645
and external to the flock.

338
00:16:38.775 --> 00:16:41.995
Now, I've, I've never owned sheep. I grew up in Edmond.

339
00:16:42.295 --> 00:16:44.195
Um, so I, I don't know

340
00:16:44.225 --> 00:16:47.155
what this analogy looks like perfectly, um,

341
00:16:47.175 --> 00:16:48.275
but I do own a puppy.

342
00:16:49.095 --> 00:16:52.355
And if you've owned a puppy, uh,

343
00:16:52.655 --> 00:16:54.195
you have tasted a little bit

344
00:16:54.225 --> 00:16:56.355
what sheep probably are like, I'm guessing.

345
00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:57.875
Um, she's adorable.

346
00:16:58.085 --> 00:17:01.275
She's basically like this tiny little potato in our house,

347
00:17:01.975 --> 00:17:03.235
um, with little legs.

348
00:17:03.665 --> 00:17:06.995
This, this little, which basically means she

349
00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:08.235
can't do anything on her own.

350
00:17:08.855 --> 00:17:12.275
Uh, we have to feed her, you know, like they say, the dogs,

351
00:17:12.575 --> 00:17:15.035
um, descended from wolves, even the ones that we own.

352
00:17:15.195 --> 00:17:16.835
I don't, I don't see it when I look at her.

353
00:17:17.075 --> 00:17:20.835
I mean, she's this big and could you imagine like a pack

354
00:17:20.835 --> 00:17:23.595
of little hers running around killing things?

355
00:17:23.955 --> 00:17:27.195
Absolutely not. So she is very dependent on us for food.

356
00:17:27.765 --> 00:17:31.835
She's very dependent on us for watching for hawks.

357
00:17:31.955 --> 00:17:33.555
'cause I'm pretty sure they could just scoop her up.

358
00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:36.595
She's that small. Um, she needs us

359
00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:38.715
to give her a place to stay.

360
00:17:39.735 --> 00:17:42.315
She can't even walk up steps on her own

361
00:17:42.315 --> 00:17:43.555
because her legs are so small.

362
00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:46.835
So she needs us just to pick her up the steps of the house.

363
00:17:47.655 --> 00:17:49.365
So when I try to think about sheep,

364
00:17:49.405 --> 00:17:52.845
I think about her name's Hazel, little Hazel being so,

365
00:17:53.025 --> 00:17:54.365
uh, dependent on us.

366
00:17:55.615 --> 00:17:58.515
Now, when we think about us being referred to

367
00:17:58.515 --> 00:18:00.715
as sheep in the Bible, we may not want think that

368
00:18:00.715 --> 00:18:03.755
that is the most flattering of analogies

369
00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:04.755
or metaphors to use.

370
00:18:05.495 --> 00:18:08.555
Um, but it's, it's pretty accurate when you think about it.

371
00:18:08.735 --> 00:18:12.915
Um, we are very much like sheep when, when it comes to

372
00:18:13.495 --> 00:18:15.875
our spiritual health.

373
00:18:16.175 --> 00:18:18.475
We are prone to wander.

374
00:18:19.095 --> 00:18:22.715
We will eat anything, um, whether it's good

375
00:18:22.815 --> 00:18:25.715
or not spiritually, uh, maybe physically too.

376
00:18:26.655 --> 00:18:30.675
Um, we are defenseless against sin.

377
00:18:30.805 --> 00:18:31.875
We're shortsighted,

378
00:18:32.895 --> 00:18:37.575
and we get sick, we get injured, and we get lost.

379
00:18:38.355 --> 00:18:42.535
Isaiah 53, 6, very common scripture we know says,

380
00:18:43.035 --> 00:18:45.415
all we like sheep have gone astray

381
00:18:46.115 --> 00:18:48.175
and we've turned everyone to his own way.

382
00:18:48.175 --> 00:18:52.135
And the Lord has caused the iniquity of Saul to fall on him.

383
00:18:54.885 --> 00:18:58.015
Ezekiel 35 also reminds us, God says,

384
00:18:58.035 --> 00:18:59.815
and you are my sheep talking to Israel.

385
00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:02.095
He says, you are my sheep, human sheep of my pasture,

386
00:19:02.835 --> 00:19:05.055
and I am your God, declares the Lord God.

387
00:19:05.795 --> 00:19:09.535
So God, God uses that analogy of sheep for us

388
00:19:09.535 --> 00:19:10.735
because he knows what we're like.

389
00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:14.535
He knows that we are, um,

390
00:19:15.335 --> 00:19:17.175
dependent for our care.

391
00:19:17.515 --> 00:19:18.535
And when you think about it,

392
00:19:18.535 --> 00:19:19.655
that's, that's actually a good thing.

393
00:19:20.195 --> 00:19:23.055
Um, because it means he's designed us that way

394
00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:26.775
to intentionally depend upon him for our care.

395
00:19:27.115 --> 00:19:29.815
He did not create us as independent beings

396
00:19:29.815 --> 00:19:31.415
that are self-sufficient.

397
00:19:31.435 --> 00:19:33.775
He ca he created us to be dependent on him.

398
00:19:33.835 --> 00:19:37.915
And that's a good thing. So one of the ways

399
00:19:37.915 --> 00:19:41.195
that God provides for his people in this way is that he

400
00:19:42.475 --> 00:19:47.265
actually partners with other sheep to shepherd his people.

401
00:19:48.255 --> 00:19:51.835
And it's been a pattern that he has used throughout history.

402
00:19:52.675 --> 00:19:54.775
Um, if we think about this in the Old Testament,

403
00:19:55.675 --> 00:19:58.215
the prime example that we all tend to go to

404
00:19:58.275 --> 00:20:01.255
and should go to in the Old Testament is David.

405
00:20:02.115 --> 00:20:06.055
So David is this standard for shepherd leadership

406
00:20:06.055 --> 00:20:07.655
that was set up in the Old Testament.

407
00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:10.715
And so of course we know the stories of David

408
00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:12.875
in his profession as a shepherd.

409
00:20:13.575 --> 00:20:16.755
Um, how he fought lions

410
00:20:16.755 --> 00:20:20.315
and bears, probably tigers, I don't know.

411
00:20:20.775 --> 00:20:23.355
Um, but as his duties as a shepherd.

412
00:20:23.575 --> 00:20:25.155
But he was also,

413
00:20:25.815 --> 00:20:28.995
before he was even made king, he was known as a leader

414
00:20:29.545 --> 00:20:32.075
that shepherded, uh, the people of Israel.

415
00:20:32.855 --> 00:20:36.435
Uh, they speak of him as remaining present with the people

416
00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:38.675
and going in and out with him.

417
00:20:38.735 --> 00:20:43.455
In fact, in two Samuel five, two hear what the words

418
00:20:43.455 --> 00:20:46.935
of the people say about David before he is anointed king.

419
00:20:47.065 --> 00:20:49.165
He said, they said, in times past

420
00:20:50.105 --> 00:20:53.395
when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out

421
00:20:53.655 --> 00:20:54.835
and brought in Israel.

422
00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:57.685
And the Lord said to you, you shall be shepherd

423
00:20:57.705 --> 00:20:58.845
of my people Israel,

424
00:20:58.905 --> 00:21:01.125
and you shall, shall be prince over Israel.

425
00:21:02.305 --> 00:21:03.325
So they recognize

426
00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:06.845
that it was David exemplifying shepherd like qualities even

427
00:21:06.845 --> 00:21:08.085
before he was named king.

428
00:21:08.345 --> 00:21:12.365
And then as king, he carried out his shepherd like duties

429
00:21:12.505 --> 00:21:14.725
by caring for and protecting the people.

430
00:21:16.535 --> 00:21:17.915
He certainly messed up plenty.

431
00:21:17.975 --> 00:21:20.035
We know David's short come comings,

432
00:21:20.035 --> 00:21:23.235
but in his submission to the Lord, he always sought

433
00:21:23.235 --> 00:21:25.555
to lead the people to the source of life.

434
00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:29.475
And that was Yahweh, their provider and their sustainer.

435
00:21:30.545 --> 00:21:33.155
However, unfortunately, if you've read the Old Testament,

436
00:21:33.495 --> 00:21:34.715
you know that this pattern

437
00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:39.195
of shepherd like kings didn't carry on past David.

438
00:21:40.525 --> 00:21:44.515
While we might have glimpses of certain kings that tried to,

439
00:21:44.735 --> 00:21:48.395
uh, follow this standard, the overall pattern

440
00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:52.835
was leading to leadership that did not shepherd well.

441
00:21:53.585 --> 00:21:56.405
In fact, Israel's rulers were selfish,

442
00:21:56.955 --> 00:22:00.805
they were self-absorbed, they were weak, careless,

443
00:22:01.475 --> 00:22:02.645
they were cowardly,

444
00:22:03.685 --> 00:22:05.905
and they were outright rebellious towards God.

445
00:22:06.955 --> 00:22:09.285
However, God is a good shepherd

446
00:22:09.545 --> 00:22:11.805
and he will not leave his people uncared

447
00:22:11.825 --> 00:22:13.485
for and unprotected.

448
00:22:14.465 --> 00:22:16.565
So with that, I want us to turn, if you have a Bible,

449
00:22:16.755 --> 00:22:18.725
will you turn to Ezekiel 34?

450
00:22:19.645 --> 00:22:21.245
I gonna spend a little bit of time here,

451
00:22:23.995 --> 00:22:28.375
and I wanna see how God handles these worthless shepherds

452
00:22:28.435 --> 00:22:30.135
and what he, what he does about it.

453
00:22:31.575 --> 00:22:35.345
Starting in verse one, or sorry, verse two, Ezekiel 34.

454
00:22:36.145 --> 00:22:38.075
This is what God tells Ezekiel.

455
00:22:39.145 --> 00:22:42.205
He says, son of man prophesy against

456
00:22:42.265 --> 00:22:43.325
the shepherds of Israel.

457
00:22:44.435 --> 00:22:47.075
Prophesy and say to them, even to the shepherds,

458
00:22:47.105 --> 00:22:50.355
thus says the Lord God, as shepherds of Israel

459
00:22:50.935 --> 00:22:52.715
who have been feeding yourselves,

460
00:22:54.475 --> 00:22:56.335
should not shepherds feed the sheep.

461
00:22:57.275 --> 00:23:00.375
You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool,

462
00:23:00.955 --> 00:23:02.415
you slaughter the fat ones,

463
00:23:02.415 --> 00:23:05.575
but you do not feed the sheep the weak.

464
00:23:05.595 --> 00:23:07.815
You have not strengthened the sick,

465
00:23:07.815 --> 00:23:09.895
you have not healed the injured,

466
00:23:09.895 --> 00:23:12.425
you have not bound up the strayed.

467
00:23:12.445 --> 00:23:16.105
You have not brought back the lost. You have not sought.

468
00:23:16.775 --> 00:23:20.515
And with force and harshness, you have ruled them all.

469
00:23:21.295 --> 00:23:24.115
And strong words that God is bringing against these rulers.

470
00:23:25.255 --> 00:23:28.035
So what are the things that they neglected to do?

471
00:23:28.215 --> 00:23:31.395
God calls them out very specifically if looking through

472
00:23:31.395 --> 00:23:34.515
that list, he says, they did not feed the sheep.

473
00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:36.785
They did not strengthen the weak.

474
00:23:37.495 --> 00:23:40.805
They did not heal the sick. They did not bind up.

475
00:23:40.805 --> 00:23:43.445
The injured did not bring back the stray.

476
00:23:44.065 --> 00:23:46.225
And they did not seek out the lost.

477
00:23:47.205 --> 00:23:49.745
And even more so than that, it wasn't just a matter

478
00:23:49.745 --> 00:23:51.105
that they neglected their duties,

479
00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:54.025
but they took advantage of their position.

480
00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:58.455
They, uh, used the people of Israel

481
00:23:58.595 --> 00:24:01.455
for their own gain at the expense of the people

482
00:24:02.275 --> 00:24:05.095
and says they ruled with force and with harshness.

483
00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:09.315
And what was the result of that kind of leadership?

484
00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:12.665
Well, at this time, Israel's an exile.

485
00:24:12.805 --> 00:24:15.545
So they're not in the land that God had led them to.

486
00:24:15.545 --> 00:24:18.385
And it says, if you read a little bit further, it says,

487
00:24:18.385 --> 00:24:21.105
the sheep were scattered, they were lost.

488
00:24:21.495 --> 00:24:25.005
They were hunted down like prey and they were eaten.

489
00:24:26.325 --> 00:24:29.305
Israel had become prey to the surrounding nations.

490
00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:32.525
They wandered and they were often even led

491
00:24:33.195 --> 00:24:34.365
into idol worship.

492
00:24:35.685 --> 00:24:36.815
They oppressed each other.

493
00:24:37.405 --> 00:24:38.895
They took advantage of one another,

494
00:24:39.595 --> 00:24:42.005
and they each did what was right in their own eyes.

495
00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:46.355
So God seeing the state of his people

496
00:24:46.375 --> 00:24:50.225
and this poor leadership declared enough, he was going

497
00:24:50.225 --> 00:24:53.345
to put a stop to it and take the staff away from those

498
00:24:53.345 --> 00:24:57.625
worthless shepherds and take the responsibility back.

499
00:25:00.325 --> 00:25:02.305
So this kind of reminds me of a time growing up.

500
00:25:03.765 --> 00:25:06.865
Uh, when my dad asked me to clean out the shed,

501
00:25:07.805 --> 00:25:10.245
I was probably 11 or 12 years old at the time.

502
00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:15.725
And, um, I had everything I needed to carry out that chore.

503
00:25:15.745 --> 00:25:16.925
He had given me the right tools.

504
00:25:17.785 --> 00:25:21.325
He had set very clear expectations for me, uh,

505
00:25:21.335 --> 00:25:22.765
about what was expected.

506
00:25:23.065 --> 00:25:25.245
In fact, he'd even shown me what the example

507
00:25:25.265 --> 00:25:26.365
of clean looks like.

508
00:25:27.065 --> 00:25:28.285
Um, if you have kids

509
00:25:28.345 --> 00:25:31.085
and you ever, um, told them, this is

510
00:25:31.085 --> 00:25:32.085
what clean actually looks

511
00:25:32.085 --> 00:25:33.245
like, you know what I'm talking about.

512
00:25:33.905 --> 00:25:36.365
So I, I knew what was was expected of me.

513
00:25:36.995 --> 00:25:40.825
However, there was one very big problem

514
00:25:41.215 --> 00:25:45.245
that I was facing in that shed was wasps.

515
00:25:46.385 --> 00:25:50.485
See, I am terrified of wasps like

516
00:25:50.585 --> 00:25:52.125
to an irrational state.

517
00:25:52.585 --> 00:25:56.805
In fact, if you wanna see anyone run as fast as they can

518
00:25:57.065 --> 00:25:58.645
and flail as wildly as I can,

519
00:25:58.645 --> 00:26:00.605
just have a wasp buzz my, my ear.

520
00:26:01.285 --> 00:26:04.045
'cause I'm, I'm going to show a perfect example of that.

521
00:26:04.085 --> 00:26:07.085
I hate wasps. And this shed

522
00:26:07.085 --> 00:26:09.685
of ours probably had a million wasps in it.

523
00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:12.365
Truthfully, it was probably only like one nest

524
00:26:12.365 --> 00:26:14.965
with 10 wasps, but it felt like a million to my 11

525
00:26:14.965 --> 00:26:16.365
or 12-year-old state.

526
00:26:17.265 --> 00:26:18.445
So needless to say,

527
00:26:18.565 --> 00:26:20.565
I didn't do the best job cleaning that shed.

528
00:26:20.585 --> 00:26:22.525
In fact, this is kind of what it looked like.

529
00:26:23.145 --> 00:26:26.285
Um, I didn't pull anything outta the shed to sweep it.

530
00:26:26.445 --> 00:26:27.445
I would open the door

531
00:26:28.305 --> 00:26:30.605
and with my broom, I would kind of run in and do like this

532
00:26:30.865 --> 00:26:33.795
and then run back out and then like run the corner,

533
00:26:33.855 --> 00:26:35.875
run back out as many times as I could just to like,

534
00:26:35.875 --> 00:26:38.475
like look, the first like five feet looked like

535
00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:39.635
it had been swept.

536
00:26:40.415 --> 00:26:41.995
Um, my dad,

537
00:26:42.085 --> 00:26:44.365
after about an hour of this charade,

538
00:26:44.395 --> 00:26:46.775
came out to inspect my work.

539
00:26:46.995 --> 00:26:48.575
And needless to say it was terrible.

540
00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:52.855
Um, and surveying the incompetent work that I had done,

541
00:26:53.635 --> 00:26:55.535
he decided at that point, you know, he's,

542
00:26:55.565 --> 00:26:56.615
he's gonna do it himself.

543
00:26:57.435 --> 00:27:01.535
And so what he did is he came out there

544
00:27:01.685 --> 00:27:05.375
with me watching, showed me how to take care of the wasps.

545
00:27:06.085 --> 00:27:10.665
Um, then he proceeded to walk me through every step

546
00:27:10.685 --> 00:27:13.665
of cleaning out that shed, pulling things out, sweeping out,

547
00:27:13.735 --> 00:27:14.745
putting it all back.

548
00:27:14.885 --> 00:27:16.545
So I knew the right way to do it at that point.

549
00:27:18.655 --> 00:27:21.075
And I think about that 'cause this is where,

550
00:27:21.075 --> 00:27:22.755
this is the point that God is at at this

551
00:27:22.755 --> 00:27:23.795
point with his shepherds.

552
00:27:23.795 --> 00:27:26.195
He says, I'm going to do this myself

553
00:27:26.295 --> 00:27:28.955
and I'm gonna show you what this looks like.

554
00:27:29.895 --> 00:27:34.195
So let's pick this back up in Ezekiel 34, verse 10.

555
00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:39.125
It says, thus says the Lord God, behold,

556
00:27:39.485 --> 00:27:41.125
I am against the shepherds

557
00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:43.845
and I'll acquire my sheep at their hand

558
00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:45.885
and put a stop to their feeding the sheep.

559
00:27:47.045 --> 00:27:49.305
No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves,

560
00:27:50.365 --> 00:27:52.215
I'll rescue my sheep from their mouths

561
00:27:52.215 --> 00:27:53.495
that they may not be food for them.

562
00:27:56.845 --> 00:28:01.285
I read that and the first thing I think of is woe to the man

563
00:28:01.465 --> 00:28:03.885
who the Lord of hosts sets himself against.

564
00:28:04.895 --> 00:28:07.335
I, I don't think there is a more terrifying position

565
00:28:07.355 --> 00:28:10.615
to be in than God saying, I'm against you.

566
00:28:12.365 --> 00:28:17.325
So I say this very, um, with a, with as much weight

567
00:28:17.385 --> 00:28:21.085
as I can that leaders of the church, leaders

568
00:28:21.225 --> 00:28:25.655
of God's people, fathers, husbands,

569
00:28:26.045 --> 00:28:27.775
mothers, all who are called

570
00:28:27.775 --> 00:28:30.615
and commanded to shepherd God's people in some fashion,

571
00:28:31.965 --> 00:28:35.585
we should hear those words and we should tremble in fear.

572
00:28:35.605 --> 00:28:39.825
If in any way we are acting as the leaders of Israel

573
00:28:39.825 --> 00:28:41.585
and taking advantage of God's people,

574
00:28:44.035 --> 00:28:48.315
let us ever be so careful to remember

575
00:28:48.315 --> 00:28:51.595
how incredibly valuable God's people are to him.

576
00:28:53.135 --> 00:28:54.395
So valuable in fact

577
00:28:54.465 --> 00:28:56.915
that God himself will step into the muck.

578
00:28:57.455 --> 00:29:01.085
He will step into the, the pit

579
00:29:02.055 --> 00:29:04.395
and shepherd with us and pull us out.

580
00:29:04.895 --> 00:29:07.035
And that's exactly what we see God do.

581
00:29:07.165 --> 00:29:10.625
Let's pick back up in verse 11.

582
00:29:12.325 --> 00:29:16.825
God says, behold, I I myself will search for my sheep

583
00:29:17.365 --> 00:29:18.625
and we'll seek them out

584
00:29:19.995 --> 00:29:22.775
as a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep

585
00:29:22.775 --> 00:29:23.815
that have been scattered.

586
00:29:24.315 --> 00:29:26.215
So will I seek out my sheep

587
00:29:26.835 --> 00:29:28.575
and I'll rescue them from all places

588
00:29:28.575 --> 00:29:30.135
where they have been scattered on a day

589
00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:31.495
of clouds and thick darkness.

590
00:29:32.355 --> 00:29:34.135
He goes on in verse 15, he says,

591
00:29:34.215 --> 00:29:36.935
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep

592
00:29:37.815 --> 00:29:40.835
and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord God.

593
00:29:41.085 --> 00:29:44.245
I will seek the lost and I'll bring back the stray

594
00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:48.165
and I'll bind up the injured and I'll strengthen the weak

595
00:29:48.585 --> 00:29:50.805
and the fat and the strong I will destroy.

596
00:29:51.935 --> 00:29:53.385
I'll feed them injustice.

597
00:29:56.225 --> 00:29:59.285
The Lord God will not leave his people wandering

598
00:29:59.315 --> 00:30:00.645
forever, forever.

599
00:30:02.075 --> 00:30:04.415
Yahweh himself, the one

600
00:30:04.475 --> 00:30:07.255
who redeemed his people from the oppression of Pharaoh,

601
00:30:07.275 --> 00:30:09.995
who led them through the wilderness, providing

602
00:30:09.995 --> 00:30:10.995
for their every need.

603
00:30:11.535 --> 00:30:13.755
He watered them. He fed them with manna.

604
00:30:14.175 --> 00:30:16.235
He healed their wounds from fiery serpents

605
00:30:16.735 --> 00:30:18.275
and he brought them to a land of abundance.

606
00:30:19.265 --> 00:30:22.875
That same God will put a stop to the neglect of his people

607
00:30:23.415 --> 00:30:25.915
and he'll be the good shepherd his sheep

608
00:30:26.305 --> 00:30:27.755
desperately require.

609
00:30:29.065 --> 00:30:31.045
And if we look at what God says he will do,

610
00:30:31.045 --> 00:30:34.145
and we contrast that with what he, the charge

611
00:30:34.145 --> 00:30:37.025
that he brought against the former shepherds,

612
00:30:38.415 --> 00:30:39.705
just look at the contrast.

613
00:30:39.775 --> 00:30:41.185
They did not seek the lost.

614
00:30:41.285 --> 00:30:43.825
And God says, I will search for my sheep

615
00:30:44.325 --> 00:30:45.545
and I will seek them out.

616
00:30:46.295 --> 00:30:47.945
They did not bring back the stray.

617
00:30:48.005 --> 00:30:50.625
And God says he will rescue them from all places

618
00:30:50.635 --> 00:30:51.865
where they have been scattered.

619
00:30:52.525 --> 00:30:54.935
They did not bind up the injured, but God says he will.

620
00:30:54.935 --> 00:30:56.175
They did not heal the sick,

621
00:30:56.395 --> 00:30:58.815
but God says he will make them lie down to rest.

622
00:30:59.965 --> 00:31:01.375
They did not strengthen the weak.

623
00:31:02.045 --> 00:31:05.415
They did not feed the sheep, but God will strengthen them

624
00:31:05.435 --> 00:31:07.175
and he will feed them with good pasture.

625
00:31:08.195 --> 00:31:10.735
And where they took advantage of the people ruling

626
00:31:10.765 --> 00:31:13.695
with harshness, God says that injustice, he

627
00:31:14.215 --> 00:31:16.535
will also destroy the fat and the strong.

628
00:31:18.155 --> 00:31:20.855
So rather than ruling, well promoting justice

629
00:31:20.985 --> 00:31:23.495
among the people, the former shepherds had sought their own

630
00:31:23.735 --> 00:31:27.255
interests and promoted a culture of self-service at the cost

631
00:31:27.915 --> 00:31:28.975
of each other's neighbor.

632
00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:33.165
And unfortunately, when people are left without a shepherd,

633
00:31:33.715 --> 00:31:36.245
without shepherds that exemplify compassion,

634
00:31:37.655 --> 00:31:40.395
self-sacrificial love, generosity, gentleness

635
00:31:40.935 --> 00:31:44.395
and justice, they will deal harshly with each other,

636
00:31:45.825 --> 00:31:48.515
each seeking to protect and preserve their own kingdoms.

637
00:31:49.175 --> 00:31:51.875
And that's what we see Israel, the state

638
00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:52.995
that Israel was in at this time.

639
00:31:53.275 --> 00:31:55.395
Actually the rest of this chapter shows

640
00:31:55.535 --> 00:31:59.075
how God will righteously step in as judge over the sheep

641
00:32:00.215 --> 00:32:01.315
and he will care for them,

642
00:32:01.335 --> 00:32:02.835
but he'll also correct them

643
00:32:03.345 --> 00:32:04.955
from taking advantage of one another.

644
00:32:05.815 --> 00:32:08.715
And then ultimately he declares that he will set up

645
00:32:08.715 --> 00:32:12.085
for them one shepherd, his servant David,

646
00:32:12.865 --> 00:32:14.635
and that he shall feed them.

647
00:32:15.785 --> 00:32:18.525
So if you think about where Israel is at this time in exile,

648
00:32:19.145 --> 00:32:21.805
you can begin to feel a little bit of anticipation

649
00:32:21.805 --> 00:32:24.245
that should have happened from reading a statement like

650
00:32:24.245 --> 00:32:28.185
this, that there is a promise that a shepherd king is coming

651
00:32:28.445 --> 00:32:30.145
that's not gonna act like our kings

652
00:32:30.535 --> 00:32:34.145
that have acted like this for for centuries.

653
00:32:36.355 --> 00:32:39.565
And yet there'll be a king that is gonna come in the line

654
00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:40.925
and in the pattern of David.

655
00:32:41.095 --> 00:32:44.885
David. And he was coming to lead as the Lord himself would.

656
00:32:45.865 --> 00:32:50.005
And if you know your Messianic history, it doesn't take long

657
00:32:50.005 --> 00:32:52.165
for us to make this connection to Jesus, right?

658
00:32:54.185 --> 00:32:55.575
Jesus is the son of David.

659
00:32:55.715 --> 00:32:59.455
He is the Christ, the Messiah, the anointed king

660
00:33:00.375 --> 00:33:01.835
and the rightful king of the Jews.

661
00:33:03.405 --> 00:33:07.105
And he is the good shepherd that God is promising here.

662
00:33:08.465 --> 00:33:11.365
And he says so himself, if we turn over to John 10,

663
00:33:12.475 --> 00:33:16.225
we'll see where Jesus says with his own words, what kind

664
00:33:16.225 --> 00:33:17.305
of shepherd he is.

665
00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:24.565
Starting in verse seven, Jesus says, Jesus says,

666
00:33:24.765 --> 00:33:25.965
I am the door of the sheep.

667
00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:29.525
All who came before me are thieves and robbers.

668
00:33:30.665 --> 00:33:32.945
Remember those is the, the rulers of Israel before,

669
00:33:33.885 --> 00:33:35.265
but the sheep did not listen to them.

670
00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:39.865
I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he'll be saved

671
00:33:40.365 --> 00:33:42.265
and will go in and out and find pasture.

672
00:33:43.475 --> 00:33:47.335
The thief comes only to still steal and kill and destroy.

673
00:33:48.405 --> 00:33:51.725
I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.

674
00:33:53.085 --> 00:33:54.325
I am the good shepherd.

675
00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:56.565
And the good shepherd lays down his life

676
00:33:57.105 --> 00:34:00.655
for the sheep going forward.

677
00:34:00.715 --> 00:34:03.135
In verse 14, he says, I know my own

678
00:34:03.155 --> 00:34:05.775
and my own know me just as the father knows me,

679
00:34:05.795 --> 00:34:09.505
and I know the Father and I lay down my life for the sheep.

680
00:34:11.705 --> 00:34:15.645
So Jesus exemplifies this good shepherd.

681
00:34:15.745 --> 00:34:19.245
And it's not just in word only look at Jesus's life.

682
00:34:19.945 --> 00:34:22.885
And we see how Jesus succeeds,

683
00:34:22.885 --> 00:34:25.005
where all the other shepherds of Israel failed.

684
00:34:26.665 --> 00:34:31.185
Jesus healed the sick, he gave sight to the blind.

685
00:34:31.245 --> 00:34:33.375
He made lame walk.

686
00:34:35.005 --> 00:34:37.505
He reached out

687
00:34:37.925 --> 00:34:40.025
and touched the unclean woman.

688
00:34:41.475 --> 00:34:45.375
He fed literally, uh, the hungry, uh, with food,

689
00:34:46.305 --> 00:34:49.965
but he also fed with the bread of life, words that gave life

690
00:34:50.145 --> 00:34:53.765
to the people he refreshed spiritually, the thirsty

691
00:34:53.765 --> 00:34:55.125
as in the case of the woman at the well.

692
00:34:56.615 --> 00:34:59.115
He sought out the lost in the outcast

693
00:34:59.255 --> 00:35:02.115
and he restored them to the fold thinking about

694
00:35:02.115 --> 00:35:05.155
how he touches the leper and brings him back in.

695
00:35:05.655 --> 00:35:07.795
He calls Matthew a tax collector.

696
00:35:08.895 --> 00:35:12.195
He dines with Zacchaeus one who's seen as a sinner.

697
00:35:13.495 --> 00:35:16.195
He warmly and he tenderly receives the young ones,

698
00:35:16.255 --> 00:35:20.035
the children to himself like a shepherd would with lambs.

699
00:35:20.495 --> 00:35:22.875
He restored hope to the sinful and the broken.

700
00:35:22.975 --> 00:35:23.995
And he gave them rest.

701
00:35:25.535 --> 00:35:28.195
He corrected courageously the ones in error.

702
00:35:29.325 --> 00:35:31.065
He washed the disciple's feet

703
00:35:31.855 --> 00:35:33.555
and he drives out the lurking enemy

704
00:35:33.555 --> 00:35:36.475
and he overthrows the oppressor and he guards

705
00:35:36.475 --> 00:35:38.005
and keeps the sheep safe.

706
00:35:39.195 --> 00:35:43.175
And then ultimately in the greatest act of caring for

707
00:35:43.175 --> 00:35:44.655
and protecting his sheep,

708
00:35:45.865 --> 00:35:48.595
our great shepherd died for us.

709
00:35:49.595 --> 00:35:52.335
He laid down his life for the sheep as he said he would.

710
00:35:52.875 --> 00:35:55.635
And what a good shepherd he is.

711
00:35:56.215 --> 00:35:59.755
And yet this wasn't the end of his service as a shepherd.

712
00:36:01.445 --> 00:36:03.265
Yes, he resurrected, he ascended,

713
00:36:03.765 --> 00:36:06.225
but he carried on his work, shepherding his people

714
00:36:06.485 --> 00:36:07.625
by sending the Holy Spirit

715
00:36:07.645 --> 00:36:09.545
to guide the church, to empower his church.

716
00:36:10.045 --> 00:36:14.065
And then he also raised up shepherds to continue the work

717
00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:17.225
that he did, to continue shepherding in the same pattern

718
00:36:18.045 --> 00:36:21.065
and in the same authority that Jesus himself did.

719
00:36:22.295 --> 00:36:25.475
In fact, he commissions Peter in John 21.

720
00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:27.275
It's a common story. We know Peter

721
00:36:27.815 --> 00:36:29.235
had denied Jesus three times.

722
00:36:29.495 --> 00:36:31.475
And after his resurrection,

723
00:36:31.485 --> 00:36:33.155
Jesus goes out to meet Peter, right?

724
00:36:34.745 --> 00:36:37.445
And as they're talking, Jesus asked Peter three times,

725
00:36:37.545 --> 00:36:39.325
he asks, he asks him, do you love me?

726
00:36:40.395 --> 00:36:42.335
And Peter responds.

727
00:36:42.395 --> 00:36:44.535
He says, yes Lord, you know that I love you.

728
00:36:45.885 --> 00:36:47.665
You know all things, you know that I love you.

729
00:36:48.345 --> 00:36:50.485
And what does Jesus say to him all three times?

730
00:36:51.345 --> 00:36:56.165
He says, then feed my sheep, tend my lambs feed my sheep.

731
00:36:58.915 --> 00:37:00.295
So notice the motivation.

732
00:37:00.995 --> 00:37:04.375
God Jesus is commissioning Peter

733
00:37:05.115 --> 00:37:06.975
to take this responsibility to shepherd.

734
00:37:07.555 --> 00:37:08.735
But the motivation there,

735
00:37:10.155 --> 00:37:12.735
you see the old shepherds failed

736
00:37:12.835 --> 00:37:15.055
and they're tasked to care for and protect the sheep

737
00:37:15.055 --> 00:37:18.015
because they did not have the right motivation.

738
00:37:19.195 --> 00:37:22.285
They did not love God's people as if they were their own.

739
00:37:23.755 --> 00:37:24.775
How could they really?

740
00:37:24.805 --> 00:37:27.845
When you think about it, yeah, this is exactly

741
00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:29.445
what Jesus calls Peter towards.

742
00:37:29.585 --> 00:37:32.565
He says, if you love me, you will do these things.

743
00:37:33.915 --> 00:37:37.285
Love for Jesus, which overflows to love for his sheep,

744
00:37:37.775 --> 00:37:39.285
those whom he valued enough

745
00:37:39.345 --> 00:37:42.365
to purchase at the highest price possible is what

746
00:37:43.045 --> 00:37:44.885
motivates good shepherding.

747
00:37:45.895 --> 00:37:47.995
And Peter, this one who just day bef days

748
00:37:47.995 --> 00:37:52.035
before denied Jesus loved Jesus enough

749
00:37:52.035 --> 00:37:54.635
to shepherd his people as Jesus did.

750
00:37:55.195 --> 00:37:58.855
And that's the example that we see out of his love for Jesus

751
00:37:59.035 --> 00:38:02.615
who first loved him, he would shepherd well his church,

752
00:38:03.875 --> 00:38:08.045
in fact so much, he brings this charge to the other elders,

753
00:38:08.145 --> 00:38:09.645
the other appointees to shepherd

754
00:38:11.105 --> 00:38:12.805
one Peter five, one through five.

755
00:38:12.865 --> 00:38:16.985
He says, so I exhort the elders among you as a fellow elder

756
00:38:17.205 --> 00:38:20.545
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well

757
00:38:20.545 --> 00:38:23.105
as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed,

758
00:38:23.585 --> 00:38:26.025
shepherd the flock of God that is among you,

759
00:38:26.975 --> 00:38:30.095
exercising oversight, not under compulsion.

760
00:38:30.935 --> 00:38:32.175
Remember the love motivation, right?

761
00:38:32.915 --> 00:38:36.725
But willingly as God would have you, not for shameful gain,

762
00:38:36.905 --> 00:38:40.655
but eagerly not domineering over those in your charge,

763
00:38:40.715 --> 00:38:42.295
but being examples to the flock.

764
00:38:43.685 --> 00:38:45.745
And when the chief shepherd recognizing

765
00:38:45.915 --> 00:38:47.105
where the source comes from,

766
00:38:47.255 --> 00:38:48.665
when the chief shepherd appears,

767
00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:51.225
you'll receive the unfading crown of glory.

768
00:38:52.405 --> 00:38:54.285
Likewise, you, you who are younger,

769
00:38:54.385 --> 00:38:55.765
be subject to the elders.

770
00:38:56.425 --> 00:38:59.845
And then he says, clothe yourselves, all of you, elders,

771
00:39:01.135 --> 00:39:03.135
shepherds, people of the church.

772
00:39:03.435 --> 00:39:05.565
All of you clothe yourselves

773
00:39:05.565 --> 00:39:07.965
with humility towards one another for God oppose

774
00:39:07.965 --> 00:39:10.165
of the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

775
00:39:11.965 --> 00:39:15.505
So that is the charge of elders to love

776
00:39:16.405 --> 00:39:17.625
as the greatest example.

777
00:39:18.315 --> 00:39:22.225
Jesus Christ, the chief shepherd, love the church to love

778
00:39:22.285 --> 00:39:24.305
and to care for and protect in the same way.

779
00:39:25.715 --> 00:39:28.175
So with that, I, I wanna, I want to end

780
00:39:29.305 --> 00:39:31.275
towards this elders that are in the room.

781
00:39:31.305 --> 00:39:33.955
Will you guys, will you men go ahead and stand up?

782
00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.755
Same with you Dan and Trevor.

783
00:39:36.035 --> 00:39:37.675
I know we're, I know we're not elders yet,

784
00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:38.795
but will you go ahead and stand up?

785
00:39:41.025 --> 00:39:43.265
I want us to commit ourselves to love Jesus

786
00:39:43.525 --> 00:39:44.625
by loving this flock.

787
00:39:45.395 --> 00:39:48.445
In this same way. Let's,

788
00:39:48.445 --> 00:39:49.885
let's commit ourselves to these things.

789
00:39:50.145 --> 00:39:53.565
We will commit to care for and protect this flock.

790
00:39:55.325 --> 00:39:57.265
We will commit to feed the hungry.

791
00:39:58.685 --> 00:40:01.865
We will commit to heal the sick and bind up the broken.

792
00:40:03.205 --> 00:40:05.785
We will commit to strengthen the weak.

793
00:40:07.095 --> 00:40:09.595
We will commit to seek out the lost

794
00:40:09.695 --> 00:40:10.915
in search for the strays.

795
00:40:11.335 --> 00:40:15.245
We commit to leading them towards rest.

796
00:40:16.405 --> 00:40:20.305
And we commit to protecting them from any who come to steal,

797
00:40:20.975 --> 00:40:24.785
kill, and destroy by way of false teaching or legalism

798
00:40:25.245 --> 00:40:27.625
or secularism or any other gospel

799
00:40:27.695 --> 00:40:29.145
that is not founded in truth.

800
00:40:30.625 --> 00:40:33.765
And if we do not commit to these things, we have no business

801
00:40:34.435 --> 00:40:36.165
leading the people of God

802
00:40:36.165 --> 00:40:37.885
because they are that valuable to him.

803
00:40:39.515 --> 00:40:41.695
So that is our commitment to this church elder,

804
00:40:41.795 --> 00:40:43.295
you can go ahead and sit back down.

805
00:40:43.295 --> 00:40:46.465
Thank you for doing that in church.

806
00:40:46.465 --> 00:40:49.665
While these men may not be perfect, there is a shepherd

807
00:40:49.805 --> 00:40:51.745
who is, and I want to give you that encouragement.

808
00:40:52.445 --> 00:40:55.235
And one day Revelation seven tells us

809
00:40:56.425 --> 00:40:59.595
that we will all rest under his shepherding.

810
00:41:01.065 --> 00:41:06.035
Revelation seven 15 through 17 says

811
00:41:06.305 --> 00:41:09.275
that therefore they are before the throne of God

812
00:41:09.275 --> 00:41:11.035
and serve him day and night in his temple.

813
00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:12.875
And he sits on the throne,

814
00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:14.515
will shelter them with his presence.

815
00:41:15.065 --> 00:41:18.595
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore.

816
00:41:19.575 --> 00:41:21.035
The sun shall not strike them,

817
00:41:21.215 --> 00:41:25.175
nor any scorching heat for the lamb in the midst

818
00:41:25.175 --> 00:41:26.895
of the throne will be their shepherd

819
00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.825
and he will guide them to springs of living water.

820
00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:34.405
And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes

821
00:41:35.255 --> 00:41:37.035
and what of encouragement that we have

822
00:41:37.035 --> 00:41:38.435
that shepherd to look forward to.

823
00:41:39.815 --> 00:41:41.715
So let's go ahead and let's go ahead and pray.

824
00:41:42.135 --> 00:41:46.275
Father, first of all, thank you

825
00:41:47.285 --> 00:41:50.865
for being such a good shepherd towards us.

826
00:41:53.595 --> 00:41:58.315
Thank you for loving us so much that you

827
00:41:59.005 --> 00:42:02.835
would send your son to make a way to have life

828
00:42:04.055 --> 00:42:07.605
with you, to

829
00:42:09.055 --> 00:42:11.965
adopting us into your family for caring

830
00:42:12.065 --> 00:42:14.085
for our every needs individually.

831
00:42:14.905 --> 00:42:18.425
And as a people. God we love you.

832
00:42:18.725 --> 00:42:20.585
We thank you for the example of Jesus.

833
00:42:22.195 --> 00:42:23.495
God, we pray for this church.

834
00:42:23.635 --> 00:42:26.855
We ask that you'll continue in this generation

835
00:42:26.875 --> 00:42:29.975
and the next generation and the next generation to raise up

836
00:42:30.235 --> 00:42:31.775
and appoint shepherds who are

837
00:42:31.775 --> 00:42:35.525
after Jesus's own heart, that love this people well,

838
00:42:35.955 --> 00:42:38.365
that care for them well, that protect them well

839
00:42:38.385 --> 00:42:41.785
and that will lead them and teach them the things that lead

840
00:42:41.785 --> 00:42:43.865
to you, our provider and our sustainer.

841
00:42:44.905 --> 00:42:46.685
And it's in your son's authority

842
00:42:47.025 --> 00:42:48.445
and power that we pray these things.

843
00:42:49.115 --> 00:42:50.115
Amen.

844
00:43:00.405 --> 00:43:03.255
Okay, thank you Jackson. Neil slipped out. So here we are.

845
00:43:03.745 --> 00:43:07.935
Thank you Chris for, uh, sharing boldly, honestly

846
00:43:08.955 --> 00:43:12.615
and for, uh, reminding us as leaders

847
00:43:12.725 --> 00:43:14.215
what the responsibility is we have.

848
00:43:14.915 --> 00:43:18.055
Um, it's a heavy high calling

849
00:43:18.235 --> 00:43:21.135
and so we need the great shepherd to do that.

850
00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:24.255
I wanna just give you a couple opportunities

851
00:43:24.315 --> 00:43:26.255
to answer the questions the other guys already answered.

852
00:43:26.315 --> 00:43:27.615
So if you've been here the last two weeks,

853
00:43:27.675 --> 00:43:29.575
you know what's coming, uh,

854
00:43:29.635 --> 00:43:31.815
but what are ways you've already been involved in

855
00:43:31.975 --> 00:43:34.255
shepherding the people of Henderson Hills since we're

856
00:43:34.495 --> 00:43:36.775
identifying shepherds and trying to then raise them up?

857
00:43:36.775 --> 00:43:37.855
What are ways you've already done that?

858
00:43:39.285 --> 00:43:40.345
Uh, yeah. First

859
00:43:40.365 --> 00:43:43.305
and foremost is with, with my family, with, uh,

860
00:43:43.325 --> 00:43:45.225
my own kids and, and my wife.

861
00:43:46.065 --> 00:43:48.475
Um, that is first

862
00:43:48.475 --> 00:43:50.755
and foremost the greatest responsibility I have of,

863
00:43:50.775 --> 00:43:52.355
of shepherding in God's people.

864
00:43:52.735 --> 00:43:55.515
And I love the call that we have to do that.

865
00:43:56.255 --> 00:44:01.115
Um, but for the last, gosh, I dunno how long, since 2013,

866
00:44:01.165 --> 00:44:03.915
we've been leading community groups here at Henderson Hills.

867
00:44:04.535 --> 00:44:06.595
Uh, we've gone through several iterations of what

868
00:44:06.595 --> 00:44:09.195
that looks like from, uh, home groups

869
00:44:09.615 --> 00:44:12.635
to meeting on Sunday nights to now here at the church.

870
00:44:12.815 --> 00:44:16.435
And that is such a great place to learn how to shepherd

871
00:44:16.435 --> 00:44:19.395
because you're in life with people.

872
00:44:19.655 --> 00:44:21.395
And we've done a lot of life together.

873
00:44:21.485 --> 00:44:24.075
We've had our kids in the community, um,

874
00:44:24.545 --> 00:44:27.195
seen people get married, we've moved, I don't know

875
00:44:27.195 --> 00:44:29.635
how many people we've gotten really good at,

876
00:44:29.635 --> 00:44:31.365
like the whole Tetris situation.

877
00:44:31.905 --> 00:44:34.645
Um, but that has been a, a great place to shepherd.

878
00:44:35.455 --> 00:44:38.165
Other than that, um, I've had the privilege

879
00:44:38.185 --> 00:44:41.485
of being a deacon since 2016 where we've got

880
00:44:41.485 --> 00:44:43.805
to serve this body in numerous ways.

881
00:44:44.725 --> 00:44:47.465
Um, I see Bob Conrad here.

882
00:44:47.725 --> 00:44:50.825
Uh, I think about all the, the times that we've got

883
00:44:50.825 --> 00:44:52.185
to shepherd and you still continue

884
00:44:52.185 --> 00:44:54.745
to shepherd those sweet members of ours

885
00:44:54.745 --> 00:44:55.785
that are over at Veritan

886
00:44:55.785 --> 00:44:57.665
and can't come over here very often anymore.

887
00:44:58.365 --> 00:45:00.105
Um, getting to shepherd

888
00:45:00.165 --> 00:45:03.665
and worship is a wonderful, um, responsibility

889
00:45:03.665 --> 00:45:05.905
and honor that I get to be a part of, um,

890
00:45:06.005 --> 00:45:10.065
and leading people into the worship of our God and Savior.

891
00:45:10.445 --> 00:45:13.745
So love that. And then basically just anywhere else I can

892
00:45:13.805 --> 00:45:16.025
get to hang out with kids at VBS

893
00:45:16.025 --> 00:45:17.265
or student ministry or anything.

894
00:45:17.295 --> 00:45:18.295
Yeah.

895
00:45:21.025 --> 00:45:23.645
So video games weren't all wasted when you talk about

896
00:45:23.745 --> 00:45:24.845
Tetris growing up.

897
00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:27.965
Right. It's helped us learn how to, it's

898
00:45:27.965 --> 00:45:28.805
A very poor life school. Yeah.

899
00:45:29.155 --> 00:45:32.125
Okay. What most excites you about

900
00:45:32.125 --> 00:45:33.525
eldership at Henderson Hills?

901
00:45:35.475 --> 00:45:40.075
Oh, man. Just getting to be a part of what God does,

902
00:45:40.535 --> 00:45:43.935
um, getting to see his kingdom built here

903
00:45:44.795 --> 00:45:47.495
and the role of being an elder.

904
00:45:47.595 --> 00:45:50.695
If that's a, if that's what God is calling me to,

905
00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:53.015
I'm just, I'm, I'm here for it.

906
00:45:53.055 --> 00:45:56.375
I wanna see what God does. I want to see how he uses

907
00:45:56.885 --> 00:45:59.735
this church to go impact the kingdom.

908
00:46:00.595 --> 00:46:04.295
Um, and this, that, that just, man, that fires me up

909
00:46:04.635 --> 00:46:08.335
to see God at work, moving in our, in our body,

910
00:46:08.555 --> 00:46:11.735
in the community here, but then in Edmond

911
00:46:12.115 --> 00:46:13.535
and across the globe.

912
00:46:13.995 --> 00:46:16.495
Um, just, yeah, if God calls me

913
00:46:16.495 --> 00:46:17.855
to be a part of it, I wanna be a part of it.

914
00:46:17.915 --> 00:46:18.915
So it's great.

915
00:46:21.025 --> 00:46:22.085
And, you know, we don't hold back

916
00:46:22.085 --> 00:46:23.285
from the heavy hitters here.

917
00:46:23.805 --> 00:46:26.245
Questions. So what's your favorite ice cream flavor?

918
00:46:28.205 --> 00:46:31.985
Brahms mint chocolate chip. Amen. Yeah.

919
00:46:31.985 --> 00:46:35.465
Anybody? There's a couple. Christine, Brahms, specifically

920
00:46:35.605 --> 00:46:36.605
Brahms. Okay. I mean,

921
00:46:36.605 --> 00:46:37.825
come on, you're from Oklahoma.

922
00:46:39.095 --> 00:46:41.345
It's true. Although my wife's from Dallas,

923
00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:43.425
Bluebell is pretty good.

924
00:46:43.555 --> 00:46:46.635
Let's just be clear. Cookie two step.

925
00:46:46.695 --> 00:46:47.635
By the way, if you haven't had

926
00:46:47.795 --> 00:46:48.795
that, that's straight from heaven.

927
00:46:49.095 --> 00:46:51.875
Uh, what is one of your primary desires

928
00:46:52.015 --> 00:46:53.475
for the church as we move forward?

929
00:46:54.245 --> 00:46:55.985
Man to love Jesus. Um,

930
00:46:56.205 --> 00:46:57.905
and that, that probably sounds cliche,

931
00:46:58.005 --> 00:47:01.245
but that, I mean, that's where it all starts.

932
00:47:01.465 --> 00:47:05.285
If, if we love Jesus, like, like really love Jesus

933
00:47:05.285 --> 00:47:09.205
because we know who he is and we love God

934
00:47:09.205 --> 00:47:10.645
because we see how amazing

935
00:47:10.785 --> 00:47:13.085
and, uh, awe inspiring he is,

936
00:47:15.305 --> 00:47:17.085
God will do amazing things here.

937
00:47:17.545 --> 00:47:20.805
So we'll see that play out in all sorts of ways.

938
00:47:20.805 --> 00:47:23.045
Loving and our neighbors and our community.

939
00:47:23.535 --> 00:47:27.005
We'll see worship that just is, um,

940
00:47:28.025 --> 00:47:29.565
man gives us a taste of what we're gonna do

941
00:47:29.565 --> 00:47:30.605
through eternity.

942
00:47:30.665 --> 00:47:34.045
So yeah, desire for the church is that we just, we fall

943
00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:38.445
in love with who God is as we see him revealed in our lives.
