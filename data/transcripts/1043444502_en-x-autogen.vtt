1
00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:02.525
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:02.585 --> 00:00:05.725
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:08.485
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:12.845
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.045
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:29.005
Good morning. Good morning.

7
00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:31.005
My name is Alan Rice

8
00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:33.525
and I'm one of your elders here in the church.

9
00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.725
My sermon title for the day is,

10
00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:40.685
which Way Are You Headed?

11
00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.525
I have the honor of preaching on the second longest Psalm

12
00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:45.885
out of all 150.

13
00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:48.605
I covered your prayers this morning

14
00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:50.005
because I have a sore throat

15
00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:52.365
and we'll see if my voice gets to the end of it.

16
00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:57.285
It is a Psalm 78 is a stunning 72 verses long.

17
00:00:58.145 --> 00:00:59.485
I'd like to start out this morning

18
00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:02.685
by reading the entire Psalm out loud so we can take in

19
00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:05.125
what I consider its epic grander.

20
00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:08.205
Then I'll give you my first reaction to it.

21
00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:12.125
Psalm 78, A MA skill of asap.

22
00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:15.785
Give ear on my people to my teaching

23
00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:18.585
and Kline your ears to the words of my mouth.

24
00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:22.465
I will open my mouth in a parable.

25
00:01:23.305 --> 00:01:25.905
I will utter dark things from of old things

26
00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:29.785
that we have heard and known that our fathers have told us.

27
00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:32.305
We will not hide them from their children,

28
00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:37.025
but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds

29
00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:39.145
of the Lord and his might

30
00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:42.065
and the wonders that he has done.

31
00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:45.065
He established a testimony in Jacob

32
00:01:45.285 --> 00:01:49.025
and appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers

33
00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:50.425
to teach to their children

34
00:01:51.135 --> 00:01:54.505
that the next generation might know them, their children

35
00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:56.345
yet unborn and arise

36
00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:59.465
and tell them to their children so

37
00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:02.185
that they should set their hope in God

38
00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:06.905
and not forget the works of God but keep his commandments

39
00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.505
and that they should not be like their fathers.

40
00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:13.105
A stubborn and rebellious generation,

41
00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:17.065
a generation whose heart was not steadfast,

42
00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:20.145
whose spirit was not faithful to God.

43
00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:24.265
The mites armed

44
00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:27.785
with a bow turned back on the day of battle.

45
00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:30.025
They did not keep God's covenant

46
00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:32.585
but refused to walk according to his law.

47
00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:34.185
They forgot his works

48
00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:36.305
and the wonders that he had shown them

49
00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:38.425
in the sight of their fathers.

50
00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.425
He performed wonders in the lands

51
00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:42.345
of Egypt in the fields of Zan.

52
00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:46.025
He divided the sea and let them pass through it

53
00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:49.105
and made the water stand like a heap.

54
00:02:49.965 --> 00:02:52.465
In the daytime He led them with a cloud

55
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:55.885
and all the night with a fiery light,

56
00:02:56.665 --> 00:02:58.565
he split rocks in the wilderness

57
00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:00.685
and gave them drink abundantly.

58
00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:04.885
As from the deep, he made streams come out of the rock

59
00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:09.125
and caused waters to flow down like rivers.

60
00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:13.635
Yet they sinned still more against him,

61
00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:16.275
rebellion against the most high in the desert.

62
00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:21.435
They tested God in their heart by demanding the food

63
00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:23.395
they craved.

64
00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:28.475
They spoke against God saying, can God

65
00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:31.115
spread a table in the wilderness?

66
00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:34.155
He struck the rock so that water gushed out

67
00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:35.595
and streams overflowed.

68
00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:40.875
Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?

69
00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:45.875
Therefore, when the Lord heard he was full of wrath,

70
00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:48.875
a fire was kindled against Jacob.

71
00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:51.435
His anger rose against Israel

72
00:03:51.505 --> 00:03:54.035
because they did not believe in God

73
00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:57.075
and did not trust his saving power.

74
00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:00.275
Yet he commanded the skies above

75
00:04:00.295 --> 00:04:01.675
and opened the doors of heaven

76
00:04:02.655 --> 00:04:05.995
and he rained down on them manna to eat

77
00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:08.995
and gave them the grain of heaven.

78
00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:13.995
Man ate the bread of the angels.

79
00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:17.215
He sent them food in abundance.

80
00:04:18.235 --> 00:04:20.655
He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens

81
00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:23.455
and by his power he let out the south wind.

82
00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:26.255
He reigned meat on them like dust,

83
00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:29.375
weaned birds like the sand of the seas.

84
00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:32.895
He let them fall in the midst of their camp all

85
00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:35.865
around their dwellings and they ate

86
00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:38.185
and were filled for.

87
00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:43.165
He gave them what they craved, but

88
00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:45.045
before they had satisfied their craving,

89
00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:47.405
while the food was still in their mouths, the anger

90
00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:51.125
of God rose against them and he killed the strongest of them

91
00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:54.645
and laid low The young men of Israel.

92
00:04:56.015 --> 00:04:59.105
In spite of all this, they still sinned.

93
00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:03.935
Despite his wonders they did not believe so.

94
00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:07.135
He made their days vanish like a breath

95
00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:10.565
and their years and terror.

96
00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:13.565
When he killed him, they sought him.

97
00:05:14.035 --> 00:05:16.285
They repented and sought God earnestly.

98
00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:20.125
They remember that God was their rock, the most high God,

99
00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:24.215
their redeemer, but they flattered him with their mouths.

100
00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:25.815
They lied to him with their tongues.

101
00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.055
Their heart was not steadfast toward him.

102
00:05:28.645 --> 00:05:31.095
They were not faithful to his covenant.

103
00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:37.175
Yet he being compassionate, atone for their iniquity

104
00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:38.575
and did not destroy them.

105
00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:41.555
He restrained his anger often

106
00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:44.275
and did not stir up all his wrath.

107
00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:46.945
He remembered they were

108
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:51.185
but flesh a win that passes

109
00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:53.265
and comes not again.

110
00:05:54.495 --> 00:05:58.205
How often they rebelled him against him in the wilderness

111
00:05:58.465 --> 00:06:00.245
and grieved him in the desert.

112
00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:03.525
They tested God again and again

113
00:06:03.785 --> 00:06:05.725
and provoked the holy one of Israel.

114
00:06:07.195 --> 00:06:08.805
They did not remember his power

115
00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:11.725
or the day when he redeemed them from the foe.

116
00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.275
When he performed his signs in Egypt

117
00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:18.435
and his marbles in the fields of zoon,

118
00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:21.435
he turned their rivers to blood

119
00:06:21.535 --> 00:06:23.555
so they could not drink of their streams.

120
00:06:23.775 --> 00:06:26.235
He sent amongst them swarms of flies,

121
00:06:26.245 --> 00:06:29.595
which devoured them in frogs which destroyed them.

122
00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:32.595
He gave their crops to the destroying locusts

123
00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:34.675
and the fruit of their labor to the locust.

124
00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:37.035
He destroyed their vines with hail

125
00:06:37.815 --> 00:06:39.595
and their sycamores with frost.

126
00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:42.475
He gave over their cattle to the hail

127
00:06:42.475 --> 00:06:45.035
and their flocks to the thunderbolts.

128
00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:49.555
He let loose on them as burning, anger, wrath, indignation

129
00:06:49.975 --> 00:06:52.515
and distress, acomp

130
00:06:53.495 --> 00:06:55.235
of destroying angels.

131
00:06:56.055 --> 00:06:57.435
He made a path for his anger.

132
00:06:58.135 --> 00:06:59.715
He did not spare them from death,

133
00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:02.075
but gave their lives over to the plague.

134
00:07:03.245 --> 00:07:07.385
He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the first fruits

135
00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.385
of the strengths in the tens of ham.

136
00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:13.075
Then he led out his people like sheep

137
00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:17.295
and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

138
00:07:18.755 --> 00:07:20.695
He led them in safety. Say they were so.

139
00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:23.425
They were not afraid, but the sea

140
00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:27.545
overwhelmed their enemies and

141
00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:29.945
and he brought them to his holy land

142
00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:32.745
to the mountain which his right hand had won.

143
00:07:33.365 --> 00:07:35.425
He drove out nations before them.

144
00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:37.825
He apportioned them for a possession

145
00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:41.385
and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.

146
00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:46.465
Yet they tested and rebelled against God the most high

147
00:07:46.485 --> 00:07:50.895
and did not keep his testimonies but turned away

148
00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:54.065
and acted treacherous like their fathers.

149
00:07:55.015 --> 00:07:58.105
They twisted like a deceitful bow

150
00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:01.945
for they provoked him to anger with their high places.

151
00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:05.625
They moved him to jealousy with their idols.

152
00:08:07.325 --> 00:08:10.175
When God heard he was full of wrath

153
00:08:11.265 --> 00:08:12.925
and he utterly rejected Israel,

154
00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:18.695
he forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt

155
00:08:18.695 --> 00:08:23.045
among mankind and delivered his power to captivity

156
00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:25.485
his glory to the hand of the foe.

157
00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:28.645
He gave his people over to the sword

158
00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:31.085
and vent his wrath on his heritage.

159
00:08:32.355 --> 00:08:34.605
Fire devoured their young men

160
00:08:35.345 --> 00:08:38.365
and their young women had no marriage song.

161
00:08:39.335 --> 00:08:41.165
Their priest fell by the sword

162
00:08:41.945 --> 00:08:45.205
and their widows made no lamentation.

163
00:08:47.415 --> 00:08:49.665
Then the Lord awoke us from sleep

164
00:08:50.665 --> 00:08:53.395
like a strong man shouting because of wine

165
00:08:54.565 --> 00:08:57.405
and he put his adversaries to route.

166
00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:01.125
He put them to everlasting shame.

167
00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:03.725
He rejected the 10 of Joseph.

168
00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.765
He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,

169
00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:12.665
but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.

170
00:09:13.725 --> 00:09:17.855
He built his sanctuary like the high heavens like the earth,

171
00:09:18.835 --> 00:09:20.185
which he has founded forever.

172
00:09:21.325 --> 00:09:23.345
He chose David, his servant,

173
00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:25.385
and took him from the sheep folds

174
00:09:26.685 --> 00:09:28.375
from following the nursing use.

175
00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:32.615
He brought him to shepherd Jacob, his people, Israel,

176
00:09:32.835 --> 00:09:36.475
his inheritance with upright heart.

177
00:09:36.655 --> 00:09:37.835
He shepherded them

178
00:09:38.335 --> 00:09:42.155
and guided them with his skillful hand.

179
00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:49.605
Now my first reaction to this psalm is this. It is awesome.

180
00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:55.005
It reminds me sadly of a movie that came out a couple

181
00:09:55.005 --> 00:09:56.485
of years before I was born.

182
00:09:57.025 --> 00:10:00.765
It was directed by an overtop director named Cecil b Demil

183
00:10:00.765 --> 00:10:03.085
and it was called the 10 Commandments.

184
00:10:04.265 --> 00:10:06.705
You know that movie? Now,

185
00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:09.865
back in those days we didn't have 3D HD

186
00:10:10.385 --> 00:10:13.985
gigantic theater screens with surround sound

187
00:10:13.985 --> 00:10:15.705
where the chairs shake along

188
00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:17.465
with the movie like a carnival ride.

189
00:10:18.885 --> 00:10:21.985
But that movie back in that day felt like that.

190
00:10:23.005 --> 00:10:25.585
The whole point of the movie was to overwhelm you

191
00:10:25.695 --> 00:10:28.785
with the grander of it all, the devastation

192
00:10:28.885 --> 00:10:30.185
of the 10 plagues

193
00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:34.465
and Moses parting the Red Sea and brought a picture.

194
00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:37.105
I hope they have it. That's still pretty cool.

195
00:10:38.845 --> 00:10:40.145
Now, after trying to get my heart

196
00:10:40.145 --> 00:10:43.785
to quit palpitating over the epic grandeur of Psalm 78,

197
00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:45.705
my second reaction was this.

198
00:10:46.405 --> 00:10:50.385
How in the world am I going to preach this Psalm

199
00:10:52.055 --> 00:10:54.045
other than reading the passages aloud

200
00:10:54.045 --> 00:10:55.805
and saying, wow, isn't that great?

201
00:10:57.025 --> 00:10:58.475
What could I possibly say?

202
00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:02.795
To me, this psalm seemed like a dramatic poetic summary

203
00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:07.035
of a section of the Bible that covers 400 years

204
00:11:07.705 --> 00:11:10.595
from 1400 BC in the time of Moses

205
00:11:11.055 --> 00:11:14.315
to about a thousand BC in the time of David and asap.

206
00:11:15.535 --> 00:11:19.195
To me it shows what is seems to be a never ending cycle

207
00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:23.795
of God being gracious to his chosen people so

208
00:11:23.795 --> 00:11:26.555
that they are in sweet harmony with him.

209
00:11:27.465 --> 00:11:30.735
Those same people rebelling against God,

210
00:11:31.085 --> 00:11:34.695
them suffering the consequences of their rebellion,

211
00:11:35.035 --> 00:11:39.655
and then God being gracious to them once again,

212
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:43.265
and that is awe inspiring.

213
00:11:44.515 --> 00:11:48.645
That shows what a patient gracious God our God is.

214
00:11:49.145 --> 00:11:51.405
Praise God. Amen.

215
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.725
But again, what was I gonna say about that

216
00:11:54.785 --> 00:11:56.165
for a 35 minute sermon?

217
00:11:57.805 --> 00:12:01.085
I don't know about you, but sometimes when I first read a

218
00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:04.165
passage of the Bible, I don't think I understand much of it.

219
00:12:05.365 --> 00:12:07.045
I think other people are smarter than me

220
00:12:07.045 --> 00:12:09.805
and they understand more out of a first reading than I do.

221
00:12:10.965 --> 00:12:12.985
But one of the things I have going

222
00:12:13.005 --> 00:12:14.905
for me in my life is curiosity.

223
00:12:15.845 --> 00:12:17.465
If I don't understand something

224
00:12:17.885 --> 00:12:21.425
and I usually don't, I'm driven inside myself

225
00:12:21.485 --> 00:12:23.865
to ask questions about it and find meaning.

226
00:12:24.715 --> 00:12:26.495
So let's go through the first part of this passage

227
00:12:26.555 --> 00:12:29.775
and ask some questions and see what we can learn together.

228
00:12:30.185 --> 00:12:34.255
Verse one, give ear on my people to my teaching.

229
00:12:34.845 --> 00:12:37.335
Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

230
00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:41.895
I will open my mouth in a parable

231
00:12:43.855 --> 00:12:46.265
asap who lived during the time of King David states that

232
00:12:46.795 --> 00:12:49.785
Psalm 78 is a parable,

233
00:12:51.365 --> 00:12:53.665
but then he goes on for the next 72 verses

234
00:12:53.665 --> 00:12:56.585
and retells a 400 year summary of Israel's history.

235
00:12:57.535 --> 00:13:00.395
But I've never heard of history being a parable before.

236
00:13:01.235 --> 00:13:03.315
I used to study literary stuff back when

237
00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:04.395
I was an English professor.

238
00:13:04.415 --> 00:13:08.515
So I'm pretty sure that a parable is a short, simple,

239
00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:13.435
often fictional story that uses an analogy

240
00:13:13.895 --> 00:13:16.835
or an example to teach a religious lesson.

241
00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:22.085
So my curiosity asked how is 72 verses

242
00:13:22.085 --> 00:13:24.165
of real history supposed to be a parable?

243
00:13:25.525 --> 00:13:29.945
As I read through several Babel commentators, do you know

244
00:13:29.945 --> 00:13:33.705
what I found out where the parable is located in this psalm?

245
00:13:35.895 --> 00:13:39.415
I found out nothing. Nothing at all.

246
00:13:40.365 --> 00:13:41.975
None of them even talked about

247
00:13:41.985 --> 00:13:44.255
where the parable is in this psalm.

248
00:13:44.515 --> 00:13:47.095
So I decided I need to read the psalm again.

249
00:13:48.275 --> 00:13:51.735
In the first eight verses, Asaf asks everyone to listen to

250
00:13:51.735 --> 00:13:53.815
what he's about to say and to tell it to your children

251
00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:55.695
and your children's children.

252
00:13:56.485 --> 00:13:57.575
It's only in verse nine

253
00:13:57.575 --> 00:14:00.495
that he actually starts retelling Israel's history.

254
00:14:01.515 --> 00:14:05.415
The first thing weirdly he writes is this, the mites

255
00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:10.015
armed with a bow turned back on the day of battle.

256
00:14:11.865 --> 00:14:14.475
This seemed to be a strange place for him to start.

257
00:14:14.735 --> 00:14:17.635
If he's telling a 400 year history of Israel,

258
00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:19.995
why does he start near the end

259
00:14:20.585 --> 00:14:23.675
when the 12 tribes are settling into the promised land?

260
00:14:25.975 --> 00:14:27.905
What was so important about the tribe

261
00:14:27.905 --> 00:14:30.985
of Ephraim turning back in the day of battle?

262
00:14:32.435 --> 00:14:36.695
So I researched all the Bible commentators about when in the

263
00:14:36.695 --> 00:14:38.535
Bible, the tribe of e RM went out

264
00:14:38.535 --> 00:14:40.015
to battle and then turned back.

265
00:14:41.385 --> 00:14:46.375
You know what I found? Yeah, nothing, absolutely nothing.

266
00:14:47.255 --> 00:14:49.975
I even found a number of scholars who affirmed

267
00:14:50.085 --> 00:14:53.885
that there's no such event ever recorded in the Bible.

268
00:14:55.605 --> 00:14:57.545
So what is ASAP doing here?

269
00:14:58.645 --> 00:15:00.625
Why does he start with an event that seems

270
00:15:00.625 --> 00:15:05.305
to have never happened, an event that seems to be fictional?

271
00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:08.385
That's when I realized that the tribe

272
00:15:08.385 --> 00:15:11.585
of efm turning back in the face of battle was in fact

273
00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:14.985
the parable of Psalm 78.

274
00:15:17.405 --> 00:15:20.365
I believe that Ephraim turning back from God is

275
00:15:20.365 --> 00:15:24.165
what ASAP uses to teach us as a religious lesson

276
00:15:24.395 --> 00:15:26.565
that explains the next 63 verses.

277
00:15:27.715 --> 00:15:31.205
When I realized that, I thought, okay, now it's a party.

278
00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.535
When I preach, I like to start with a big analogy,

279
00:15:36.265 --> 00:15:37.655
often a visual effect

280
00:15:37.655 --> 00:15:40.935
or a prop to explain the thesis of my sermon.

281
00:15:41.825 --> 00:15:43.855
Today, this visual effect is a piece

282
00:15:43.855 --> 00:15:46.215
of art which you can see I think up here on the screen.

283
00:15:48.705 --> 00:15:51.645
Uh, my daughter Dia produced this wonderful piece

284
00:15:51.645 --> 00:15:52.925
of art for this sermon.

285
00:15:53.785 --> 00:15:57.165
It is this image that I believe can help us understand

286
00:15:58.535 --> 00:16:00.605
Asaps parable in Psalm 78.

287
00:16:01.745 --> 00:16:03.005
So let's imagine a world

288
00:16:03.935 --> 00:16:06.925
where there's a locked gate right in front of you.

289
00:16:08.055 --> 00:16:09.715
The lock gate opens and

290
00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:14.475
before you straight up a steep hill is

291
00:16:15.355 --> 00:16:18.315
a stonewalled lane stones on each side.

292
00:16:19.615 --> 00:16:22.145
Imagine that the climb is hard as you go up,

293
00:16:22.405 --> 00:16:23.865
but it is made easier by the fact

294
00:16:23.865 --> 00:16:27.225
that you were walking toward a glorious light

295
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.625
that fills your heart with joy.

296
00:16:30.915 --> 00:16:32.815
Now, imagine that if you turn around

297
00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:35.215
and go down, that the descent is easy

298
00:16:35.215 --> 00:16:37.735
because gravity is pulling you downward.

299
00:16:38.475 --> 00:16:41.775
The bad news is, is that as you are stumbling downward,

300
00:16:42.155 --> 00:16:45.655
the lane gets darker and gloomier.

301
00:16:47.665 --> 00:16:50.285
Two weeks ago, John Wilmuth pointed out in his sermon

302
00:16:50.315 --> 00:16:53.645
that darkness in the Bible often means sin,

303
00:16:54.035 --> 00:16:55.805
evil and even death.

304
00:16:57.905 --> 00:17:00.405
So our analogy today is a stonewalled lane,

305
00:17:01.795 --> 00:17:04.095
and when I preach, I like to have a short, simple thesis

306
00:17:04.165 --> 00:17:05.615
that I state right up front.

307
00:17:05.875 --> 00:17:08.095
So the rest of this sermon makes some sense.

308
00:17:09.045 --> 00:17:11.455
This morning, my thesis is just four words long

309
00:17:11.455 --> 00:17:15.855
and it is this walk in the light

310
00:17:18.625 --> 00:17:22.245
in Psalm 78, ASF starts at the end about a thousand BC

311
00:17:22.245 --> 00:17:23.245
and he goes backward

312
00:17:23.265 --> 00:17:26.845
and he applies his parable to the first 400 years.

313
00:17:27.965 --> 00:17:28.965
I wanna do the same thing

314
00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:32.245
and talk about how this parable applies to us now

315
00:17:32.705 --> 00:17:35.285
as Christians and then later go back

316
00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:38.445
and trace those concepts through Psalm 78.

317
00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:42.475
For decades, I've been telling the community groups

318
00:17:42.475 --> 00:17:45.115
that I teach that all human beings have exactly

319
00:17:45.415 --> 00:17:46.675
one job in life.

320
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:50.125
You have one priority as we all go through life,

321
00:17:50.345 --> 00:17:53.445
and that is walk in the light.

322
00:17:55.055 --> 00:17:56.875
If you're not a Christian, your one job,

323
00:17:57.025 --> 00:18:01.195
your main priority in life is to walk into the light

324
00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:04.115
for the first time by becoming a Christian.

325
00:18:05.305 --> 00:18:08.935
Right now, everyone who isn't a Christian is locked outside

326
00:18:08.965 --> 00:18:13.135
that gate that leads to the stonewalled lane outside

327
00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:14.775
that gate is deep darkness.

328
00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:19.605
John bunion in his renaissance classic pilgrim's Progress

329
00:18:20.195 --> 00:18:22.885
uses this exact analogy of a locked gate

330
00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:25.925
to the stonewalled lane and leading it up to God.

331
00:18:26.545 --> 00:18:28.005
And I borrowed that analogy

332
00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:30.925
and I've reworked it quite a bit for this sermon.

333
00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:33.255
If you aren't a Christian,

334
00:18:33.255 --> 00:18:35.855
you can't walk up the lane in the light toward God

335
00:18:36.445 --> 00:18:40.185
because all human beings, all of us are born

336
00:18:40.615 --> 00:18:43.785
with a sinful nature called original sin

337
00:18:44.655 --> 00:18:48.265
that makes us rebel against God.

338
00:18:49.325 --> 00:18:51.585
The only way for us to get through that locked gate

339
00:18:51.585 --> 00:18:55.665
and into the light of a personal relationship with God is

340
00:18:55.685 --> 00:19:00.445
to respond to God's call, to let God unlock the gate for us

341
00:19:00.705 --> 00:19:02.645
and for us to walk through the gate

342
00:19:02.665 --> 00:19:05.845
by accepting Jesus Christ as our savior

343
00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:10.425
and as our Lord accepting Jesus Christ

344
00:19:10.425 --> 00:19:14.465
as our savior means to ask Jesus, to forgive us all

345
00:19:14.465 --> 00:19:18.245
of our sins so that he will wash us clean

346
00:19:18.475 --> 00:19:19.725
with the precious blood

347
00:19:19.795 --> 00:19:24.375
that he shed when he died upon the cross, so

348
00:19:24.375 --> 00:19:27.695
that all of our sins past, present,

349
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:31.455
and future are taken away forever.

350
00:19:32.565 --> 00:19:36.595
Amen. And

351
00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:40.535
that is when we begin entering the gate,

352
00:19:40.725 --> 00:19:42.335
walking uphill to the light

353
00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:45.375
and beginning a sweet personal relationship

354
00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:48.725
with Jesus Christ as an added bonus

355
00:19:49.765 --> 00:19:52.245
entering the gate enables us to go to heaven when we die,

356
00:19:52.895 --> 00:19:55.365
which is a pretty good perk, all in all,

357
00:19:58.765 --> 00:20:00.415
Accepting Jesus as our Lord.

358
00:20:00.515 --> 00:20:04.055
We said savior. Now our Lord means that for the rest

359
00:20:04.055 --> 00:20:07.175
of our lives we make Jesus our authority.

360
00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:11.295
We're dedicating ourselves to do what he wants us to do, go

361
00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:12.615
where he wants us to go.

362
00:20:13.595 --> 00:20:16.615
We are no longer the boss of our lives but Jesus is.

363
00:20:17.705 --> 00:20:21.435
This empowers us to live richer, fuller,

364
00:20:21.545 --> 00:20:24.515
more fulfilled lives on this earth as a kind

365
00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.115
of dress rehearsal for heaven.

366
00:20:27.955 --> 00:20:30.695
So now, if you're a Christian, you've accepted Jesus Christ

367
00:20:30.695 --> 00:20:31.855
as you're saving your Lord

368
00:20:32.235 --> 00:20:34.295
and that gate has been unlocked for you,

369
00:20:34.715 --> 00:20:36.775
you are now on the stonewalled lane.

370
00:20:37.925 --> 00:20:41.105
Congratulations, but your one job,

371
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:45.505
your main priority each day is to walk in the like.

372
00:20:45.935 --> 00:20:48.845
That is to walk in the Holy Spirit.

373
00:20:48.935 --> 00:20:51.605
Those terms are used interchangeably in the Bible.

374
00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:55.085
The Bible says that when anyone becomes a Christian,

375
00:20:55.105 --> 00:20:59.285
the Holy Spirit who is God actually comes to live in

376
00:20:59.285 --> 00:21:03.365
that person and it is the Holy Spirit who infuses us

377
00:21:03.425 --> 00:21:06.805
and inspires us as we walk in the light.

378
00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:10.205
Let's look at a portion of a letter written

379
00:21:10.205 --> 00:21:12.205
by the apostle John who was

380
00:21:12.225 --> 00:21:14.925
by Jesus' side when he was on the cross.

381
00:21:15.355 --> 00:21:17.485
This is one John one, five through nine.

382
00:21:17.955 --> 00:21:20.205
This is the message that we have heard from him

383
00:21:20.265 --> 00:21:24.165
and proclaim to you that God is light

384
00:21:25.225 --> 00:21:27.525
and in him there is no darkness at all.

385
00:21:28.025 --> 00:21:29.885
If we say we have fellowship

386
00:21:29.885 --> 00:21:33.405
with him while we walk in darkness, we lie

387
00:21:33.705 --> 00:21:35.325
and we do not practice the truth.

388
00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:39.915
But if we walk in the light as he is in the light,

389
00:21:40.015 --> 00:21:42.875
we have fellowship with one another

390
00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:47.275
and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.

391
00:21:48.055 --> 00:21:50.715
If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves

392
00:21:50.975 --> 00:21:52.355
and the truth is not in us.

393
00:21:53.255 --> 00:21:56.995
If we confess our sins, he is faithful

394
00:21:57.055 --> 00:21:58.995
and just to forgive us our sins

395
00:21:59.095 --> 00:22:01.955
and de cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

396
00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:05.535
Now many Christians think that once they get

397
00:22:05.535 --> 00:22:07.375
through the gate their job is done.

398
00:22:07.515 --> 00:22:08.855
I'm a Christian, woo woo.

399
00:22:10.115 --> 00:22:12.705
There are a lot of Christians sitting around on the ground

400
00:22:12.965 --> 00:22:14.905
of the lane just inside the gate,

401
00:22:16.295 --> 00:22:19.475
but our job as Christians, once we're inside that gate is

402
00:22:19.475 --> 00:22:22.195
to walk in that light up the hill.

403
00:22:23.995 --> 00:22:25.605
Furthermore, some Christians think

404
00:22:25.605 --> 00:22:29.085
that since they accepted Jesus, their job is now

405
00:22:29.305 --> 00:22:30.685
to try to be good.

406
00:22:32.725 --> 00:22:36.545
Here's the problem. Human beings are not very good at being

407
00:22:36.545 --> 00:22:38.785
good and that includes Christians.

408
00:22:40.075 --> 00:22:43.615
The only way to be good is to walk in the light

409
00:22:44.235 --> 00:22:47.095
and let the Holy Spirit flow through you

410
00:22:47.795 --> 00:22:50.855
and let the Holy Spirit be good through you.

411
00:22:52.285 --> 00:22:54.055
This is the idea of walking in the light.

412
00:22:55.115 --> 00:22:59.055
That's where the joy and the glory of life is.

413
00:23:01.085 --> 00:23:04.375
Walking in the light gives us a lot of immense blessings.

414
00:23:04.665 --> 00:23:07.695
First, it keeps us in that warm glow

415
00:23:07.715 --> 00:23:09.335
of our relationship with Jesus.

416
00:23:10.635 --> 00:23:12.855
As we walk in the light, we go uphill

417
00:23:14.005 --> 00:23:16.775
growing in spiritual maturity over time

418
00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:22.495
and growing in what the apostle Paul calls sanctification,

419
00:23:23.425 --> 00:23:25.135
which means we become more

420
00:23:25.475 --> 00:23:29.495
and more holy walking up the hill as we become more

421
00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:31.295
and more like Christ.

422
00:23:33.175 --> 00:23:35.715
Second, walking in the light produces in us over time.

423
00:23:35.725 --> 00:23:36.755
Great attributes.

424
00:23:37.785 --> 00:23:42.195
What Galatians chapter five calls the fruit singular

425
00:23:42.535 --> 00:23:46.805
of the spirit, love, joy,

426
00:23:47.815 --> 00:23:52.605
peace, patience, kindness, goodness,

427
00:23:53.205 --> 00:23:57.485
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.

428
00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:03.195
Third, walking. The light also produces in a certain

429
00:24:03.345 --> 00:24:07.475
abilities kind of like superpowers called the gifts

430
00:24:07.855 --> 00:24:12.195
of the Holy Spirit, which flow through us outward

431
00:24:12.255 --> 00:24:14.795
to bless the church and to bless others.

432
00:24:15.925 --> 00:24:18.595
These gifts of the spirit include gifts like teaching,

433
00:24:19.575 --> 00:24:23.085
leadership, faith, wisdom,

434
00:24:24.155 --> 00:24:28.885
healing, miracles and administration just to name a few.

435
00:24:29.985 --> 00:24:32.325
All of these things are great blessings

436
00:24:32.325 --> 00:24:34.445
that come when we walk in the light,

437
00:24:36.175 --> 00:24:38.435
but how do we as Christians walk in the light?

438
00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:43.875
We must place ourselves where God's present abides.

439
00:24:45.085 --> 00:24:49.385
The apostle James, Jesus's brother simply tells us in James

440
00:24:49.385 --> 00:24:52.945
chapter four verse eight, draw near to God

441
00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:55.145
and he will draw near to you.

442
00:24:56.975 --> 00:24:59.315
We draw near to God in part by practicing

443
00:24:59.315 --> 00:25:01.875
what are called this spiritual disciplines.

444
00:25:03.185 --> 00:25:06.205
Now the spiritual disciplines are lifelong practices which

445
00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:09.005
we develop in order to walk into the light,

446
00:25:09.845 --> 00:25:11.485
focusing our eyes upon God.

447
00:25:12.455 --> 00:25:14.605
These spiritual disciplines include things like

448
00:25:15.165 --> 00:25:18.085
praising God, giving thanks to God,

449
00:25:18.825 --> 00:25:21.005
things like Bible study, meditation

450
00:25:21.025 --> 00:25:24.485
and prayer, which is why many Christians start the day out

451
00:25:24.485 --> 00:25:25.885
with a quiet time with God.

452
00:25:26.745 --> 00:25:30.285
Things like worship, like we are doing this hour,

453
00:25:31.825 --> 00:25:34.525
things like fellowship, stewardship and service.

454
00:25:34.655 --> 00:25:35.845
There are many more of these.

455
00:25:36.935 --> 00:25:41.005
Practicing these spiritual disciplines turns our head uphill

456
00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:44.845
so that we can walk in the light closer to God.

457
00:25:46.485 --> 00:25:47.985
But what about the other direction?

458
00:25:49.375 --> 00:25:52.225
What about stumbling downward into the darkness?

459
00:25:54.185 --> 00:25:56.205
Do you know why we all sin?

460
00:25:57.945 --> 00:26:00.195
It's because we like it.

461
00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:03.655
The Bible tells us that even

462
00:26:03.675 --> 00:26:07.135
as Christians we're still affected by original sin, by

463
00:26:07.135 --> 00:26:11.415
what the Bible calls in us, the flesh which can pull us

464
00:26:11.935 --> 00:26:15.535
downward like the weight of gravity on a steep hill.

465
00:26:16.835 --> 00:26:19.095
How does this happen? It's pretty simple.

466
00:26:19.795 --> 00:26:23.855
We are focused upon some other small G God

467
00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:28.015
who is not almighty God, just like the tribe of Ephraim did.

468
00:26:28.445 --> 00:26:31.135
Even as Christians, we still do desire to sin, to do

469
00:26:31.135 --> 00:26:33.855
what we want to do to become our own gods

470
00:26:34.035 --> 00:26:35.575
or to choose some false God

471
00:26:35.805 --> 00:26:37.375
that we think will make us happy.

472
00:26:39.475 --> 00:26:44.215
God's like sexual sin, alcohol, drugs,

473
00:26:45.275 --> 00:26:47.855
or envy, hatred, pride,

474
00:26:47.875 --> 00:26:51.415
and maybe especially in Edmond, money, power or fame.

475
00:26:52.345 --> 00:26:55.135
These and many more are the gods we sometimes worship.

476
00:26:55.435 --> 00:26:58.815
So we try to get out of life what we think we want so much.

477
00:27:00.675 --> 00:27:03.305
Since sin is like gravity pulling us down the hill,

478
00:27:03.405 --> 00:27:04.785
how do we ever have the strength

479
00:27:04.965 --> 00:27:06.905
to go up the hill into the light?

480
00:27:08.565 --> 00:27:11.185
The answer is, is that as we walk more

481
00:27:11.405 --> 00:27:15.385
and more in the light, we find ourselves loving

482
00:27:16.045 --> 00:27:18.065
God more than we like to sin.

483
00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:23.345
The Westminster shorter catechism, which attempts

484
00:27:23.345 --> 00:27:26.025
to capture the essence of all the Bible in just a few words,

485
00:27:26.525 --> 00:27:30.105
states that the purpose of every human life is quote

486
00:27:30.525 --> 00:27:34.625
to glorify God and enjoy him forever.

487
00:27:36.795 --> 00:27:38.455
Sounds a lot like walking in the light.

488
00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:42.255
So walking in the light over times gives us the deepest

489
00:27:42.255 --> 00:27:46.145
fulfillment A human being can have a fulfillment

490
00:27:46.145 --> 00:27:48.425
that we will enjoy even more deeply in heaven.

491
00:27:50.305 --> 00:27:52.465
I love Augustine Bishop of Hippo

492
00:27:52.465 --> 00:27:56.625
who lived in the four hundreds ad he called this fulfillment

493
00:27:57.085 --> 00:27:58.585
of walking into the light.

494
00:27:58.645 --> 00:28:00.905
He called it sovereign joy.

495
00:28:03.135 --> 00:28:06.465
Augustine was obsessed with sexual lust in his life,

496
00:28:06.765 --> 00:28:10.105
but over time he felt like he didn't want to choose

497
00:28:10.615 --> 00:28:12.705
lust anymore because it caused him

498
00:28:13.005 --> 00:28:16.665
to miss out on God's presence in his life

499
00:28:16.845 --> 00:28:20.345
and he wanted that sovereign joy with God

500
00:28:22.395 --> 00:28:25.455
and the way that we're headed can turn on a dime

501
00:28:26.075 --> 00:28:27.855
and it can change many times a day.

502
00:28:28.765 --> 00:28:32.745
You can be driving down the road praying, praising Jesus,

503
00:28:33.455 --> 00:28:36.385
singing Christian songs on K love,

504
00:28:38.485 --> 00:28:40.425
and then suddenly some guy next

505
00:28:40.425 --> 00:28:42.305
to you starts laying on his horn

506
00:28:42.305 --> 00:28:45.105
and you don't even know why he veers in front of you.

507
00:28:45.105 --> 00:28:47.705
Roll down his window and he gives you one

508
00:28:47.705 --> 00:28:49.665
of his fingers like, like maybe this one.

509
00:28:50.015 --> 00:28:53.995
Okay. And suddenly our heads are turned around

510
00:28:54.015 --> 00:28:57.795
and we're stumbling downhill into the darkness of road rage.

511
00:28:59.665 --> 00:29:03.265
I give you that hypothetical, extremely hypothetical example

512
00:29:03.545 --> 00:29:06.105
'cause that's pretty much how I responded to a jerk.

513
00:29:06.225 --> 00:29:09.345
I mean a person about a month ago,

514
00:29:11.045 --> 00:29:13.265
and anger isn't even one of my many weaknesses

515
00:29:14.715 --> 00:29:18.245
when we turned back into the darkness, how far we go down

516
00:29:18.245 --> 00:29:20.605
that hill, that's up to each one of us.

517
00:29:22.165 --> 00:29:24.145
We can ask forgiveness of God, pray

518
00:29:24.165 --> 00:29:26.785
and turn back up the hill toward the light at any time,

519
00:29:28.195 --> 00:29:31.195
but do we, and if so, how long does it take?

520
00:29:32.335 --> 00:29:34.795
So I ask my sermon title to all of us again,

521
00:29:35.645 --> 00:29:37.555
which way are you headed?

522
00:29:38.785 --> 00:29:42.525
Okay, so that's how ASFs parable applies to us here and now.

523
00:29:42.775 --> 00:29:44.645
Let's go back and see how it applies

524
00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:49.205
to Psalm 78, verse nine.

525
00:29:51.025 --> 00:29:52.205
The mites armed

526
00:29:52.205 --> 00:29:55.045
with the bow turned back on the day of battle.

527
00:29:57.965 --> 00:29:59.655
They did not keep God's covenant

528
00:29:59.755 --> 00:30:02.015
but refused to walk according to his law.

529
00:30:02.015 --> 00:30:03.855
So it's not a physical going into battle.

530
00:30:04.005 --> 00:30:05.695
This is a spiritual thing with them.

531
00:30:06.245 --> 00:30:07.535
They forgot his works

532
00:30:07.675 --> 00:30:09.935
and the wonders that he had shown them in

533
00:30:09.935 --> 00:30:11.055
the sight of their father's.

534
00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:12.735
God performed wonders in the land

535
00:30:12.735 --> 00:30:14.175
of Egypt, in the fields of Zoe.

536
00:30:16.115 --> 00:30:18.895
Now we know from this passage that

537
00:30:19.295 --> 00:30:22.575
whenever God was gracious to the tribe of, uh, to Israel

538
00:30:22.575 --> 00:30:25.575
or to Ephraim, that they felt a close connection

539
00:30:27.185 --> 00:30:28.645
uh, with God.

540
00:30:28.985 --> 00:30:32.285
And the text says that they praised him wholeheartedly.

541
00:30:33.165 --> 00:30:36.065
And yet the passage says that they turned back on the day

542
00:30:36.065 --> 00:30:38.505
of battle again, this is a C'S parable.

543
00:30:38.895 --> 00:30:40.185
They turned their heads

544
00:30:40.725 --> 00:30:42.625
and they were walking downhill

545
00:30:43.135 --> 00:30:46.515
into the darkness in their hearts.

546
00:30:47.305 --> 00:30:49.995
What happened next? They did not keep God's covenant

547
00:30:50.095 --> 00:30:52.075
but refuse to walk according to his law.

548
00:30:52.135 --> 00:30:53.475
So they got their head turned around

549
00:30:53.575 --> 00:30:55.875
and then they said, I'm not even going that way again.

550
00:30:55.975 --> 00:30:56.955
I'm going down.

551
00:31:01.055 --> 00:31:04.355
Notice here that Asaf uses the literal metaphor of walking.

552
00:31:04.465 --> 00:31:06.355
Just like in our big picture analogy

553
00:31:06.415 --> 00:31:08.155
of walking the stonewalled lane.

554
00:31:09.285 --> 00:31:11.145
The tribe of Ephraim was refusing

555
00:31:11.205 --> 00:31:12.505
to walk in God's direction.

556
00:31:12.505 --> 00:31:15.585
Then what happens next is they forgot his works

557
00:31:15.725 --> 00:31:17.625
and the wonders he had shown them.

558
00:31:19.155 --> 00:31:20.465
How's that even possible?

559
00:31:21.125 --> 00:31:23.225
How could they forget the Cecil B

560
00:31:23.245 --> 00:31:25.425
to mill over the top miracles

561
00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:27.385
that God had performed for them?

562
00:31:28.575 --> 00:31:30.355
The answer is surprisingly simple.

563
00:31:31.565 --> 00:31:34.415
When we stumble downward into the darkness,

564
00:31:35.075 --> 00:31:38.455
we get a whole lot of spiritually stupid.

565
00:31:40.335 --> 00:31:43.995
The Apostle John speaking specifically of the sin

566
00:31:43.995 --> 00:31:47.635
of hatred writes about what I call this spiritual stupidity.

567
00:31:47.695 --> 00:31:51.555
One John two, whoever says he's in the light

568
00:31:51.655 --> 00:31:53.915
and hates his brother is still in the darkness.

569
00:31:53.915 --> 00:31:57.355
Whoever loves his brother abides in the light

570
00:31:58.175 --> 00:32:00.475
and in him there is no cause for stumbling,

571
00:32:01.135 --> 00:32:04.315
but whoever hates his brother is in the darkness

572
00:32:04.735 --> 00:32:06.595
and walks in the darkness

573
00:32:06.895 --> 00:32:09.395
and does not know where he is going

574
00:32:09.785 --> 00:32:13.915
because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

575
00:32:15.965 --> 00:32:17.315
Let's notice the pattern here.

576
00:32:17.395 --> 00:32:19.315
As it happened to Ephraim, first

577
00:32:20.065 --> 00:32:22.755
they turned their heads the wrong way from the direction

578
00:32:22.775 --> 00:32:23.955
and they were going backwards.

579
00:32:23.955 --> 00:32:27.195
Second, in their downward trek, they deliberately refused

580
00:32:27.495 --> 00:32:29.715
to turn back uphill toward the light

581
00:32:29.775 --> 00:32:32.555
and third in their downward plunge into darkness.

582
00:32:32.555 --> 00:32:34.355
They got a whole lot of spiritually stupid.

583
00:32:35.785 --> 00:32:38.565
Now let's look at the next section of Psalm 78

584
00:32:38.655 --> 00:32:43.525
where it goes back from 1008 BC to 14,

585
00:32:44.345 --> 00:32:45.485
uh hundred bc.

586
00:32:46.145 --> 00:32:48.565
Uh, when the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness

587
00:32:48.565 --> 00:32:51.605
and he applies the parable to them, verse 17,

588
00:32:51.745 --> 00:32:54.725
yet they sin still more against him rebelling against the

589
00:32:54.725 --> 00:32:55.765
most high in the desert.

590
00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:59.085
They tested God in their hearts

591
00:32:59.085 --> 00:33:01.885
by demanding the food they craved.

592
00:33:03.035 --> 00:33:04.605
They spoke against God saying,

593
00:33:05.025 --> 00:33:07.725
can God spread a table in the wilderness?

594
00:33:08.265 --> 00:33:10.205
He struck the rock, so the water ged

595
00:33:10.205 --> 00:33:11.245
out and streams overflowed.

596
00:33:11.505 --> 00:33:14.925
Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?

597
00:33:16.655 --> 00:33:17.705
What was the cause

598
00:33:17.725 --> 00:33:20.105
of the peoples turning away from God this time?

599
00:33:20.845 --> 00:33:22.105
It was their cravings.

600
00:33:23.745 --> 00:33:25.605
God gave the people a pillar

601
00:33:25.985 --> 00:33:29.845
of cloud casting a long shadow across the desert

602
00:33:30.225 --> 00:33:33.005
to help keep the people cooler by day,

603
00:33:33.225 --> 00:33:35.245
and he gave them a pillar fire

604
00:33:35.585 --> 00:33:39.805
to help keep the people warm in the frigid deserts at night.

605
00:33:40.995 --> 00:33:42.405
Then God struck a rock

606
00:33:42.505 --> 00:33:46.045
and caused water to gush out so that the people had plenty

607
00:33:46.105 --> 00:33:47.725
to drink even in the desert.

608
00:33:49.175 --> 00:33:53.935
And then later God gave them man to eat as verses 23

609
00:33:53.935 --> 00:33:55.175
through 25 state.

610
00:33:55.595 --> 00:33:57.855
Yet he commanded the skies above

611
00:33:58.035 --> 00:33:59.455
and opened the doors of heaven

612
00:34:00.075 --> 00:34:02.975
and he rained down on them manna to eat

613
00:34:03.755 --> 00:34:06.095
and gave them the grain of heaven.

614
00:34:07.635 --> 00:34:10.695
Man ate of the bread of angels.

615
00:34:11.945 --> 00:34:14.205
He sent them food in abundance.

616
00:34:16.255 --> 00:34:20.195
The bread of the angels. God sounds amazing.

617
00:34:20.915 --> 00:34:25.075
I want some, but of all that wasn't enough

618
00:34:25.095 --> 00:34:26.515
for the children of Israel.

619
00:34:26.655 --> 00:34:30.195
In in numbers 11 verses four through six, it says,

620
00:34:30.455 --> 00:34:33.835
now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving,

621
00:34:34.185 --> 00:34:38.375
same word, and the people visual also wept again

622
00:34:38.395 --> 00:34:41.415
and said, oh, that we had meat to eat.

623
00:34:42.635 --> 00:34:46.295
We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing,

624
00:34:47.755 --> 00:34:51.175
the cucumbers, the melons, the Lees, the onions

625
00:34:51.755 --> 00:34:55.865
and the garlic, but now our strength is dried up

626
00:34:55.865 --> 00:34:59.065
and there's nothing at all, but there's man not to look at.

627
00:35:00.595 --> 00:35:02.005
They followed their cravings.

628
00:35:03.705 --> 00:35:05.715
What they're saying here doesn't even make sense.

629
00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:07.715
I see at least three problems with it.

630
00:35:08.055 --> 00:35:11.695
One, they remember the menu items available

631
00:35:11.715 --> 00:35:14.655
to them in Egypt, fish, onions and so on.

632
00:35:14.915 --> 00:35:17.615
But do you know what menu item was not available

633
00:35:17.675 --> 00:35:18.775
to them in Egypt?

634
00:35:19.385 --> 00:35:23.855
Manna, manna miraculously falling from heaven thou bread

635
00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:24.975
of the angels.

636
00:35:26.185 --> 00:35:28.725
Second, they remembered that the food in Egypt was free,

637
00:35:30.505 --> 00:35:34.325
but you know what else is free in to them in the desert?

638
00:35:34.895 --> 00:35:38.005
Manna, manna miraculously falling from heaven, the bread

639
00:35:38.005 --> 00:35:40.315
of angels again.

640
00:35:40.365 --> 00:35:43.435
Third, they remember with fondness that the food of Egypt,

641
00:35:43.855 --> 00:35:47.935
it was free, but do you remember why it was free?

642
00:35:48.735 --> 00:35:51.105
Because they were slaves in Egypt

643
00:35:51.125 --> 00:35:55.465
and were never given any money for their labor to pay

644
00:35:55.485 --> 00:35:56.705
for things like food.

645
00:35:58.515 --> 00:36:01.415
So they were beaten by the Egyptian slave masters

646
00:36:01.675 --> 00:36:04.415
and then no doubt given the cheapest food possible.

647
00:36:05.685 --> 00:36:08.325
I don't think the Israelites were eating takeout from Red

648
00:36:08.325 --> 00:36:10.765
Lobster here, and

649
00:36:10.765 --> 00:36:13.525
yet all they can do is complain against the God

650
00:36:13.525 --> 00:36:15.525
that rescued them from slavery

651
00:36:16.075 --> 00:36:19.725
because he doesn't provide as many menu options

652
00:36:20.145 --> 00:36:22.925
as their old vicious slave masters did.

653
00:36:25.305 --> 00:36:28.715
This revolt, this turning back downhill away from God

654
00:36:29.775 --> 00:36:31.435
is absolutely ridiculous.

655
00:36:32.135 --> 00:36:34.825
Do you know what's even more ridiculous?

656
00:36:36.255 --> 00:36:38.505
When I turned my back downhill

657
00:36:38.885 --> 00:36:40.745
for stupider reasons than theirs?

658
00:36:42.865 --> 00:36:45.795
Have you turned back downhill for ridiculous reasons?

659
00:36:46.855 --> 00:36:48.275
In a way, they're all ridiculous.

660
00:36:48.385 --> 00:36:50.035
It's God we're talking about here.

661
00:36:51.235 --> 00:36:53.495
The enduring word Bible commentary points out here

662
00:36:53.645 --> 00:36:57.095
that God promises to provide for our needs.

663
00:36:57.515 --> 00:37:00.535
He never promised to fulfill all of our cravings,

664
00:37:02.555 --> 00:37:04.415
and then after turning their heads downhill

665
00:37:04.415 --> 00:37:07.975
because they wanted a broader menu options, the children

666
00:37:07.995 --> 00:37:11.775
of Israel got a whole lot of even more spiritually stupid.

667
00:37:14.025 --> 00:37:17.565
Can God spread a table in the wilderness?

668
00:37:18.745 --> 00:37:21.565
Can he provide meat for his people?

669
00:37:23.065 --> 00:37:27.435
They asked two heretical words here, can God

670
00:37:29.005 --> 00:37:30.795
these people have seen God work some

671
00:37:30.795 --> 00:37:33.435
of the greatest miracles in human history, miracles

672
00:37:33.435 --> 00:37:35.795
that impress me even on a movie screen,

673
00:37:36.335 --> 00:37:39.155
and now they are textbooks spiritually stupid.

674
00:37:40.215 --> 00:37:43.635
If we wanted a t-shirt message that perfectly captured

675
00:37:44.675 --> 00:37:45.715
spiritual faithlessness

676
00:37:45.975 --> 00:37:48.995
and darkness, all it would need to say across the front

677
00:37:48.995 --> 00:37:51.955
of it is, can God question mark?

678
00:37:54.265 --> 00:37:57.115
Just review some basic theology here.

679
00:37:57.115 --> 00:38:01.555
For newbies, God is all powerful, which is

680
00:38:01.555 --> 00:38:02.755
to say almighty.

681
00:38:03.025 --> 00:38:05.555
He's all seeing. He's all knowing.

682
00:38:06.385 --> 00:38:10.275
He's omnipresent, he's immortal, he's infinite.

683
00:38:11.775 --> 00:38:14.715
He is beyond all space, beyond all time

684
00:38:14.775 --> 00:38:16.395
and beyond all physical matter

685
00:38:16.395 --> 00:38:18.675
because he created all those things

686
00:38:19.015 --> 00:38:21.835
and was outside of them when he created them.

687
00:38:23.175 --> 00:38:26.085
There are some things God will not do, like anything evil,

688
00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:29.125
but regarding his almighty power, there is nothing

689
00:38:29.745 --> 00:38:32.805
God cannot do, period.

690
00:38:36.275 --> 00:38:38.085
What follows is divine punishment.

691
00:38:39.615 --> 00:38:42.875
As human beings, we were designed to be our most fulfilled,

692
00:38:43.105 --> 00:38:46.675
walking in the light uphill toward the presence of God.

693
00:38:47.655 --> 00:38:50.835
We go against our grand design when we had downhill

694
00:38:51.345 --> 00:38:53.835
into the darkness and we suffer for it.

695
00:38:55.295 --> 00:38:58.555
The purpose of every human life is to worship God

696
00:38:58.695 --> 00:38:59.755
and enjoy him forever.

697
00:38:59.975 --> 00:39:03.395
To walk in the light turning away from that purpose,

698
00:39:03.425 --> 00:39:06.835
turning away from that light just brings emptiness,

699
00:39:07.855 --> 00:39:11.675
unfulfillment, damage, sorrow,

700
00:39:12.855 --> 00:39:15.475
sin, evil, and even death.

701
00:39:17.245 --> 00:39:18.745
In the Old Testament, the presence

702
00:39:18.745 --> 00:39:22.185
of God was manifest in a powerful way in the Ark

703
00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:24.825
of the Covenant, remember Raiders of the Lost Ark, okay.

704
00:39:26.095 --> 00:39:28.835
As we have seen, the tribe of eem consistently,

705
00:39:29.195 --> 00:39:32.715
metaphorically walked, downhill away from God,

706
00:39:32.865 --> 00:39:34.115
away from his presence.

707
00:39:34.935 --> 00:39:37.235
On the other hand, the tribe

708
00:39:37.235 --> 00:39:42.075
of Judah consistently walked uphill toward God into the

709
00:39:42.075 --> 00:39:45.715
light because Efram kept turning

710
00:39:45.825 --> 00:39:47.315
away from God.

711
00:39:47.695 --> 00:39:51.675
God removed the Ark of the covenant from the city of Shiloh

712
00:39:51.855 --> 00:39:56.115
and and he had it moved sort of

713
00:39:56.175 --> 00:39:59.835
by the Philistines indirectly to the city

714
00:40:00.095 --> 00:40:04.745
of Jerusalem in Judah, by continually turning back hill,

715
00:40:05.055 --> 00:40:07.865
Ephraim literally lost God's special presence

716
00:40:08.765 --> 00:40:10.585
by walking in the like Jerusalem,

717
00:40:10.585 --> 00:40:13.665
and Judah was blessed by God's presence in the arc

718
00:40:13.665 --> 00:40:17.865
of the covenant, and Jerusalem became the spiritual capital.

719
00:40:19.775 --> 00:40:22.525
Verse 67, he rejected the tent of Joseph.

720
00:40:22.745 --> 00:40:24.605
He did not choose the tribe of Ephrem,

721
00:40:24.745 --> 00:40:28.285
but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.

722
00:40:28.745 --> 00:40:32.725
He built his sanctuary like the high heavens like the earth,

723
00:40:32.895 --> 00:40:34.405
which he founded forever.

724
00:40:36.735 --> 00:40:39.955
In the next section of Psalm 78, ASAP emphasizes

725
00:40:40.065 --> 00:40:43.555
that God's relationship with his people did not stop

726
00:40:43.705 --> 00:40:47.715
with Moses, but has passed down 400 years

727
00:40:48.055 --> 00:40:49.355
to asaps own time.

728
00:40:49.975 --> 00:40:53.635
By the way, God's presence is always in the here and now,

729
00:40:55.245 --> 00:40:58.425
but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.

730
00:40:58.525 --> 00:41:01.025
He built his sanctuary like the high heavens,

731
00:41:01.215 --> 00:41:03.025
like the earth, which he has founded forever.

732
00:41:03.405 --> 00:41:04.945
He chose David, his servant,

733
00:41:05.205 --> 00:41:07.905
and took him from the sheep folds from following

734
00:41:07.985 --> 00:41:09.025
the nursing uses.

735
00:41:09.405 --> 00:41:13.545
He brought him to shepherd Jacob, his people, Israel,

736
00:41:13.725 --> 00:41:16.585
his inheritance with upright heart.

737
00:41:16.725 --> 00:41:18.745
He shepherded them and he guided them

738
00:41:18.935 --> 00:41:20.465
with his skillful hand.

739
00:41:22.195 --> 00:41:24.455
If you know the history of King, deputy Noman a number

740
00:41:24.455 --> 00:41:26.775
of times when he turned his head downhill

741
00:41:26.875 --> 00:41:29.895
and stumbled into the darkness just like all of us,

742
00:41:31.405 --> 00:41:34.605
but the grand arc of David's life was that he strived

743
00:41:34.665 --> 00:41:36.205
to turn his head upward

744
00:41:36.385 --> 00:41:38.565
and to walk toward God into the light.

745
00:41:39.345 --> 00:41:41.645
One Samuel 13, 14 states simply

746
00:41:42.075 --> 00:41:44.885
that the Lord sought David out to rule Israel

747
00:41:44.885 --> 00:41:48.125
because David was a man after God's own heart.

748
00:41:50.025 --> 00:41:52.995
Despite his flaws, David is a role model for us,

749
00:41:54.035 --> 00:41:56.655
and yet David the Shepherd was a foreshadowing,

750
00:41:57.095 --> 00:42:00.695
a future prediction of the great shepherd who was to come.

751
00:42:02.105 --> 00:42:05.935
Jesus is our great role model in how to seek God's face,

752
00:42:06.315 --> 00:42:07.335
how to walk in the light.

753
00:42:08.515 --> 00:42:12.535
In fact, Jesus said that he himself is the light.

754
00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:17.195
Pauly Miller, in his book of Praying life states that

755
00:42:17.805 --> 00:42:21.115
Jesus was the most dependent human being who ever lived.

756
00:42:22.575 --> 00:42:25.795
He wrote this because Jesus was absolutely continually

757
00:42:26.075 --> 00:42:30.175
dependent upon God the Father, Jesus always went off

758
00:42:30.175 --> 00:42:31.735
by himself to a quiet place

759
00:42:31.755 --> 00:42:33.815
and took time for the spiritual disciplines.

760
00:42:34.205 --> 00:42:37.335
Even when the crowds were clamoring for his attention,

761
00:42:38.785 --> 00:42:41.175
Jesus was always walking in the light.

762
00:42:43.465 --> 00:42:45.055
God's presence, God's relationship

763
00:42:45.055 --> 00:42:47.855
with His people is always in the here and now.

764
00:42:49.575 --> 00:42:52.515
We stand here in the last week of 2024.

765
00:42:54.055 --> 00:42:57.075
The New Year's holiday is a time for all of us to look back

766
00:42:57.655 --> 00:43:00.765
and to look ahead for each of us.

767
00:43:00.795 --> 00:43:03.885
This can be a time of reflection upon where we are

768
00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:08.755
in our journey with God in this new year.

769
00:43:10.015 --> 00:43:13.435
Let us focus upon walking in the light

770
00:43:13.775 --> 00:43:17.675
of our glorious God who can make us more

771
00:43:17.975 --> 00:43:20.155
and more like Christ over time.

772
00:43:21.475 --> 00:43:23.695
Let us practice the spiritual disciplines,

773
00:43:23.795 --> 00:43:25.335
not in a legalistic way,

774
00:43:25.715 --> 00:43:29.415
but let us look through the spiritual disciplines into

775
00:43:29.555 --> 00:43:30.615
the face of Jesus.

776
00:43:32.155 --> 00:43:35.335
Let us praise and thank our most high loving God.

777
00:43:36.385 --> 00:43:39.645
Let us fellowship with him in Bible study, in meditation,

778
00:43:39.705 --> 00:43:41.485
in prayer, and in the other disciplines.

779
00:43:42.265 --> 00:43:45.125
Let us worship him with our speech and with our singing.

780
00:43:46.365 --> 00:43:47.975
Furthermore, let us tell our children

781
00:43:48.155 --> 00:43:52.775
and their children about how great God is praising

782
00:43:52.915 --> 00:43:56.415
and glorifying his name from one generation to the next

783
00:43:56.985 --> 00:44:01.535
until our Lord Jesus Christ returns in bodily form.

784
00:44:01.915 --> 00:44:05.175
On that great day of his second coming,

785
00:44:07.755 --> 00:44:11.095
my sermon title for this really long psalm was really a

786
00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:12.895
question, which way are you headed?

787
00:44:13.835 --> 00:44:16.375
And my sermon thesis was the answer to that question.

788
00:44:17.165 --> 00:44:20.475
Walk in the light. If you're not a Christian, I said,

789
00:44:20.495 --> 00:44:23.035
the main purpose in your life is to become a Christian

790
00:44:23.415 --> 00:44:25.115
to walk into the light for the first time.

791
00:44:26.175 --> 00:44:29.555
Accept Jesus. We don't do alter calls,

792
00:44:29.655 --> 00:44:32.885
but I'm sure down here at the end we're gonna have pastors,

793
00:44:32.885 --> 00:44:34.125
counselors, elders.

794
00:44:34.825 --> 00:44:36.965
You may want to talk to some Christian that you know,

795
00:44:36.965 --> 00:44:40.885
but you may feel urged to talk about it down here today.

796
00:44:42.145 --> 00:44:44.755
Come down and talk to them about where you are in your life

797
00:44:45.615 --> 00:44:46.835
if you are a Christian, I said,

798
00:44:46.835 --> 00:44:49.155
your main priority in life is to walk in the light,

799
00:44:49.775 --> 00:44:51.075
to walk in the Holy Spirit.

800
00:44:51.805 --> 00:44:54.235
Maybe you wanna come down and talk to counselors

801
00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:56.835
because maybe you've never thought through this before.

802
00:44:56.885 --> 00:44:59.925
Maybe you want prayer. The New

803
00:44:59.925 --> 00:45:01.925
year lies before us.

804
00:45:03.445 --> 00:45:04.885
Whatever troubles we have in our lives,

805
00:45:05.405 --> 00:45:06.925
whatever struggles we're going through,

806
00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:11.925
let us walk in the light together, becoming more

807
00:45:11.925 --> 00:45:16.185
and more like Christ, who is our hope and our forever.

808
00:45:16.295 --> 00:45:18.585
Lord, let's pray together.

809
00:45:21.015 --> 00:45:24.375
Heavenly Father, we pray to you that you would fill us

810
00:45:24.375 --> 00:45:26.135
with your Holy Spirit this morning,

811
00:45:26.135 --> 00:45:27.855
that we would walk in the light.

812
00:45:29.155 --> 00:45:32.375
We pray for those who are not Christians,

813
00:45:33.085 --> 00:45:37.015
that you would pull them to you in a warm hug.

814
00:45:38.115 --> 00:45:40.775
We pray for those of us who are Christians,

815
00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:45.695
that we would be renewed in our spirits seeking your face

816
00:45:46.685 --> 00:45:48.145
giving praise to your name.

817
00:45:49.235 --> 00:45:49.525
Amen.
