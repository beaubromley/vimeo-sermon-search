WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.275 --> 00:00:03.605
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:06.805
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.565
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:13.925
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:17.085
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:29.485
Good morning, church. Uh, my name's Tiara Lewis

7
00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:32.405
and I'm one of the elders here at Henderson Hills.

8
00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:34.005
It's a joy to get to be with you on this summer,

9
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.845
Sunday morning, uh, studying the Psalms.

10
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:39.405
So that's a lot of s's I'm practicing, uh,

11
00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.445
and getting ready up here, um, in the pulpit.

12
00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:43.325
So we're thankful that you're here today.

13
00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:47.485
Um, last week we got to hear from Perry Walker, uh, teach

14
00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.845
and walk with us through Psalm 65.

15
00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:52.965
And today we'll be studying Psalms chapter 66.

16
00:00:53.545 --> 00:00:55.925
So if you wanna turn in your word there.

17
00:00:57.065 --> 00:01:00.885
Um, next week will be obviously in 67 and,

18
00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:03.685
and hear about letting the nations be glad.

19
00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:07.205
And both of, both of those chapters contain the phrase

20
00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:10.525
to the ends of the earth, to the ends of the earth.

21
00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:14.045
And then today we're going to talk about shouting

22
00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:18.445
and singing and saying that the Lord is good.

23
00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:21.325
So before we begin our time, let's go to the word in prayer.

24
00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:24.725
Father God, um, we thank you

25
00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:27.605
for your word this morning.

26
00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:32.285
We come together as your body, as your bride to study it.

27
00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:34.725
We pray, Lord, that your spirit would speak

28
00:01:34.725 --> 00:01:37.205
to our hearts corporately, but also individually.

29
00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:41.805
I pray, Lord, that um, the words that you've given to me,

30
00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:43.605
that your spirit would communicate

31
00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:45.925
and that your word would ring true.

32
00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:50.885
Lord, we love you. It's in Christ and we pray. Amen. Amen.

33
00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:54.405
So last week, Perry started off with a question.

34
00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:58.485
His question was, how big is your God?

35
00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:00.605
And my question this morning

36
00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:02.085
that we're gonna talk about a little bit is

37
00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:03.845
what gets you excited?

38
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:05.925
What gets you excited?

39
00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:10.045
And I went to school at Texas a

40
00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:13.165
and m, whoop, for any Aggies.

41
00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:14.805
Uh, we're gonna talk about whooping.

42
00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:16.645
So if there's any Aggies in the audience,

43
00:02:16.645 --> 00:02:17.845
we're gonna learn about that today.

44
00:02:17.845 --> 00:02:22.005
And Texas a and m is a place that knows how to get excited.

45
00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:25.645
In fact, there are more traditions than we could talk

46
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.685
about in a Sunday morning.

47
00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:28.485
And freshmen going into a

48
00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:31.445
and m go to a whole week called Fish Camp,

49
00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:33.285
where they learn all the yells

50
00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:36.365
and the hand motions, the songs

51
00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:39.205
and the stories of Texas a and m.

52
00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:43.045
They learn about what it means to be an Aggie, even

53
00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:46.165
before they stepped foot on campus for the first time.

54
00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:50.805
And one of the most famous traditions is the Aggie whoop.

55
00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:53.525
And it goes through different iterations depending on

56
00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:54.725
what year you are in school,

57
00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:58.645
but you may hear it at football games or basketball games,

58
00:02:58.785 --> 00:02:59.805
or even in class.

59
00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:03.085
Uh, anytime something's said, that's good.

60
00:03:03.465 --> 00:03:08.205
You might hear whoop and has even infiltrated the church in

61
00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:10.245
College Station so that

62
00:03:10.245 --> 00:03:13.885
after baptisms when brothers

63
00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:15.765
and sisters in Christ come out of the water,

64
00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:18.765
the sanctuary rings out in whoops,

65
00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:22.885
in jubilant shouts of joy.

66
00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:28.165
And so as I opened Psalm 66 and looked at it,

67
00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:31.325
and the psalmist says, shout for joy to God,

68
00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:33.325
I was taken back to Central Baptist Church

69
00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.285
where we were whooping right there in service.

70
00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:41.045
And so the other, the other tradition they have is one of,

71
00:03:41.145 --> 00:03:42.525
uh, midnight Yell practice.

72
00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:44.125
And at midnight Yell Practice,

73
00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:46.685
they practice all these things at midnight,

74
00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:49.325
they practice the yells, they sing the songs,

75
00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:52.525
we sing the songs together, and then they tell stories.

76
00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:55.885
And the stories stir the, stir the hearts

77
00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:59.965
of the students leading up to Saturday morning

78
00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:02.445
for the football game, for the big game, we get ready.

79
00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:06.525
And so this morning I pray

80
00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:08.805
that this psalm stirs our soul.

81
00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:14.045
So let's read starting off in Psalm 66, chapter one,

82
00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:18.445
the psalmist writes, shout for joy to God all the earth.

83
00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:23.685
Sing the glory of his name. Give to him glorious praise.

84
00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:28.565
Say to God, how awesome are your deeds?

85
00:04:29.905 --> 00:04:31.125
So great is your power

86
00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:33.165
that your enemies come cringing to you.

87
00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:36.565
All the earth worships you and sings praises to you.

88
00:04:37.155 --> 00:04:40.645
They sing praises to your name, Sayah.

89
00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:44.205
Now this sayah we'll see, it's a, it's a pause.

90
00:04:44.315 --> 00:04:45.965
It's a moment to catch your breath, right?

91
00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:49.005
When, when you're that excited, you gotta catch your breath.

92
00:04:49.065 --> 00:04:51.005
And so the psalmist is catching his breath

93
00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:54.845
because he's excited, he's calling this into worship.

94
00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:56.605
He's pumped about his God,

95
00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:58.525
and he wants the world to know about it.

96
00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:01.685
And it's easy to get excited about the things

97
00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:02.925
that stir our soul, right?

98
00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:07.685
It's easy to get excited about sports or the stock market

99
00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:13.045
or cooking or even old trucks or travel.

100
00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:15.405
So many things can stir our soul.

101
00:05:15.505 --> 00:05:18.925
And we, and we dive deep, we dive deep into those things

102
00:05:18.925 --> 00:05:20.205
that we get excited about.

103
00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:22.565
And it should be the same with God.

104
00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:28.325
The more we sit at his feet, the more we rely on him,

105
00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:31.565
the more we go according to his will for our lives.

106
00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:34.245
We should get fired up.

107
00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:36.845
We should be excited, and we should live in awe

108
00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:38.525
of all that he has done.

109
00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:43.525
So in some ways, our shouts of joy, our songs

110
00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:46.045
can be a, a reflection

111
00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:50.605
or an evidence of the depth of our relationship with God.

112
00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:54.245
Because I know when I'm walking closely with God,

113
00:05:54.325 --> 00:05:55.765
I can get really excited about it.

114
00:05:55.765 --> 00:05:59.725
And I want to go more. The songs of joy are in my heart.

115
00:05:59.905 --> 00:06:01.885
The shouts of praise are on my lips.

116
00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:06.685
But when I'm not, the cares of the world can begin

117
00:06:06.685 --> 00:06:07.885
to choke those things out.

118
00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:11.245
And I look for other things to find that excitement

119
00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:12.805
and other things to find that joy.

120
00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:20.205
But our relationship with God, our understanding

121
00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:22.325
of who he is, it should cause us to shout,

122
00:06:22.905 --> 00:06:23.965
to kick our heels up

123
00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:26.005
and shout, to throw our hands up and shout.

124
00:06:26.655 --> 00:06:30.005
Don't forget to say you will Jeff Berkholder.

125
00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:34.645
So we shout, we make a joyful noise to the Lord.

126
00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:36.205
That's what we, we read about

127
00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:38.485
and we sang about in Psalms 95.

128
00:06:39.575 --> 00:06:42.285
Peter in the first chapter of his first letter calls it

129
00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:47.805
inexpressible joy, that joy is almost inexpressible for us.

130
00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:51.765
And we know that that joy is a fruit of the spirit.

131
00:06:54.025 --> 00:06:55.685
It doesn't come from something

132
00:06:55.685 --> 00:06:57.805
that we can well up on our own.

133
00:06:58.635 --> 00:07:02.005
It's the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives.

134
00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:07.645
So we, we shout with joy. That's right.

135
00:07:08.185 --> 00:07:10.205
So next, next in this passage,

136
00:07:10.425 --> 00:07:12.325
the psalmist calls us to sing.

137
00:07:13.105 --> 00:07:17.965
So as we sing, we lift a melody of praise to God,

138
00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:20.125
a melody of pleasing praise.

139
00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:22.525
So what is a melody of pleasing praise?

140
00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:24.965
Now, when we were worshiping, they had

141
00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:26.525
to turn my microphone down, right?

142
00:07:27.295 --> 00:07:30.085
Right. And I can't play any of these instruments,

143
00:07:31.025 --> 00:07:32.485
but we all have a song.

144
00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:36.565
We all have a melody of praise that we can lift

145
00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:39.405
as the spirit weaves together the different

146
00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:40.445
parts of our lives.

147
00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:43.805
It creates a song that's pleasing to God.

148
00:07:44.705 --> 00:07:47.525
Um, I heard a radio story even yesterday about an orchestra

149
00:07:47.745 --> 00:07:50.285
in Vienna, Austria that's made purely of vegetables.

150
00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:52.245
It's a vegetable orchestra.

151
00:07:52.865 --> 00:07:54.845
And every, every performance they have

152
00:07:54.845 --> 00:07:56.725
to make their new instruments out of what they have,

153
00:07:56.725 --> 00:07:57.805
what they've gotten at the market.

154
00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:00.925
And they put together these beautiful songs

155
00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:05.525
that are a conglomeration of what has been

156
00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:06.925
provided for them that day.

157
00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:08.525
And the same is true in our lives,

158
00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:11.405
that we raise a hallelujah, we sing a hallelujah

159
00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:15.125
with our lives by what the spirit does in us.

160
00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:19.205
And, and this song is a song to God,

161
00:08:19.205 --> 00:08:21.765
but it should also be one that's enjoyed by the people

162
00:08:21.765 --> 00:08:23.045
around us, right?

163
00:08:24.265 --> 00:08:26.325
Our song, the Song of our Lives is one

164
00:08:26.325 --> 00:08:27.365
that should be pleasing.

165
00:08:28.305 --> 00:08:30.205
And when we get a song stuck in our head,

166
00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:32.765
it can affect us, right?

167
00:08:32.765 --> 00:08:34.565
It changes the way we look at the world.

168
00:08:36.385 --> 00:08:40.445
And this most beautiful music of the spirit artistically

169
00:08:40.545 --> 00:08:43.645
and creatively working in our hearts is

170
00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:45.525
what the psalmist is calling us to.

171
00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:49.365
He's calling us to sing with our lives to the Lord.

172
00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:53.965
And then ultimately in these, in these first verses,

173
00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:58.565
he calls us, he says, say to the Lord, say to God,

174
00:08:59.225 --> 00:09:01.325
how awesome are your deeds?

175
00:09:02.665 --> 00:09:06.445
So we share what is awesome about God.

176
00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:08.645
And there are so many awesome things.

177
00:09:09.425 --> 00:09:10.805
But you see, it's one thing to shout.

178
00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:13.005
It's one thing to shout to get somebody's attention.

179
00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:16.805
It's another thing to sing a love song

180
00:09:17.105 --> 00:09:19.165
to your girlfriend or to your boyfriend.

181
00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:24.285
But it's a far different level to sit with the one

182
00:09:24.285 --> 00:09:27.965
that you love and to speak very plainly about the things

183
00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:31.845
that stir your affections for that person.

184
00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:34.005
And that's what we are to do to God.

185
00:09:34.025 --> 00:09:37.205
We are to proclaim the awesome deeds

186
00:09:37.205 --> 00:09:38.445
that we have seen him do.

187
00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:41.965
Not because he needs to hear it, but

188
00:09:41.965 --> 00:09:45.725
because it does our soul good to say it, to speak it.

189
00:09:47.465 --> 00:09:51.325
You see, God is honored in our lives when we

190
00:09:51.325 --> 00:09:52.525
speak of his good deeds.

191
00:09:52.785 --> 00:09:55.605
And we are also blessed when I'm driving

192
00:09:55.605 --> 00:09:57.165
to work in the morning and I see the sunrise

193
00:09:57.305 --> 00:10:00.205
and I say, wow, God, what a beautiful sunrise.

194
00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:05.165
Right? It blesses my soul and it honors him who created it.

195
00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:08.365
When I'm enjoying nature outside playing golf

196
00:10:08.425 --> 00:10:10.245
or working in the garden, and I look around

197
00:10:10.345 --> 00:10:12.965
and I say, wow, God, thank you for the variety

198
00:10:13.025 --> 00:10:15.605
of your creation, for the variety

199
00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:17.365
and the beauty of what you have made.

200
00:10:18.185 --> 00:10:21.725
It honors him and it refocuses my heart on him as well.

201
00:10:21.725 --> 00:10:26.445
When I'm at work and I get to say, I get to share

202
00:10:27.385 --> 00:10:31.605
how beautifully he made a child's broken bones to be healed,

203
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:36.405
it honors him and it blesses my soul as well.

204
00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:40.765
And so as the psalmist, as we see the mighty deeds of God,

205
00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.085
it should call us to shout, to get excited.

206
00:10:43.785 --> 00:10:47.325
It should create a song of praise in our lives.

207
00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:51.045
And also it's a discipline for us to sit

208
00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:54.525
and to say, to share, how awesome are your deeds?

209
00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:59.525
And one thing about being excited is that we want

210
00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:00.965
to share it, right?

211
00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:03.325
We wanna share the things that we're excited about.

212
00:11:04.105 --> 00:11:05.845
And we see that in this psalm.

213
00:11:07.505 --> 00:11:10.925
We see that, um, the Psalmist shares

214
00:11:11.465 --> 00:11:14.485
on a corporate level and on an individual level.

215
00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:16.965
So there's two parts to the story,

216
00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:19.605
and that's true in our lives as well.

217
00:11:20.955 --> 00:11:23.685
It's true that there's a corporate story, the story

218
00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:27.685
of the body of God weaving his narrative.

219
00:11:28.265 --> 00:11:30.165
And then there's the individual story of our lives.

220
00:11:30.175 --> 00:11:32.365
Think about, think about a great movie

221
00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:34.725
and how there's this big grand story,

222
00:11:34.725 --> 00:11:36.645
but then also there's that main character, right?

223
00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:38.165
So I think about saving Private Ryan.

224
00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:41.805
So saving Private Ryan is set in World War ii,

225
00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:45.125
and it tells a bit of the story of World War ii,

226
00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:49.765
but really it's the story of a band of soldiers

227
00:11:50.505 --> 00:11:52.045
and then ultimately of one man,

228
00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:54.685
it tells the story of Private Ryan.

229
00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:58.845
And this psalm is similar, right?

230
00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:02.705
It tells the story of

231
00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:04.625
the nation of Israel,

232
00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:07.885
and then it also tells the story of the psalmist.

233
00:12:07.885 --> 00:12:09.445
So let's start with the corporate.

234
00:12:09.505 --> 00:12:11.605
The corporate story starts in chapter five.

235
00:12:11.825 --> 00:12:13.765
I'm gonna read verses five through 12.

236
00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:18.005
He writes, come and see what God has done.

237
00:12:19.185 --> 00:12:21.885
He is awesome in his deeds towards the children of man,

238
00:12:22.465 --> 00:12:24.325
he turned the sea into dry land

239
00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:27.485
and they pass through the river on foot there.

240
00:12:27.985 --> 00:12:32.765
Did we rejoice in him who rules by his might forever,

241
00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:35.965
whose eyes keep watch over the nations,

242
00:12:36.905 --> 00:12:39.165
but not the rebellious exalt themselves.

243
00:12:40.865 --> 00:12:42.805
He goes on, he says, bless our God

244
00:12:42.905 --> 00:12:45.645
or peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard.

245
00:12:45.945 --> 00:12:48.885
Who has kept our soul among the living

246
00:12:49.345 --> 00:12:53.165
and has not let our feet slip for you.

247
00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:54.725
Oh, God have tested us.

248
00:12:55.425 --> 00:12:57.965
You have tried us as silver is tried.

249
00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:00.125
You brought us into the net.

250
00:13:01.425 --> 00:13:03.685
You laid a crushing burden on our backs.

251
00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:05.325
You let men ride over our heads.

252
00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:07.765
We went through fire

253
00:13:08.345 --> 00:13:13.005
and through water, yet you have brought us into a

254
00:13:13.005 --> 00:13:14.525
place of abundance.

255
00:13:15.675 --> 00:13:18.845
Amen. So in these verses, we're invited to come

256
00:13:19.185 --> 00:13:20.605
and see, to come

257
00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:23.885
and remember to place our mind on the good things

258
00:13:23.885 --> 00:13:26.525
that God has done for the nation of Israel

259
00:13:26.905 --> 00:13:29.005
to place our minds on his awesome deeds.

260
00:13:29.745 --> 00:13:31.325
And the first awesome deed

261
00:13:31.325 --> 00:13:33.405
that we see the psalmist praise God for

262
00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:36.765
is the rescue of his people.

263
00:13:37.945 --> 00:13:41.765
We see the psalmist praise God for the rescue of his people.

264
00:13:41.825 --> 00:13:45.165
He points to the Red Sea, which is perhaps one

265
00:13:45.165 --> 00:13:46.285
of the most famous stories

266
00:13:46.345 --> 00:13:50.205
and most clear demonstrations of God's sovereignty,

267
00:13:50.225 --> 00:13:52.965
of his care, of his rescue from the people they were,

268
00:13:52.995 --> 00:13:55.045
they were fleeing from the Egyptians, right?

269
00:13:55.045 --> 00:13:56.325
And they came up to this sea

270
00:13:56.385 --> 00:13:59.965
and they didn't have anywhere else to go, but God made a way

271
00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:01.845
and they walked through on dry land.

272
00:14:03.115 --> 00:14:06.645
When our family was living in Nicaragua, uh, we,

273
00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:08.565
we got exposed to a song.

274
00:14:08.565 --> 00:14:10.485
There's a singer named Danny Barrios.

275
00:14:10.485 --> 00:14:12.965
And Danny sings a lot of really beautiful songs.

276
00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:14.645
Um, one of our friends

277
00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:17.045
that was there would often on his guitar play

278
00:14:17.045 --> 00:14:21.405
and sing a song called Hymn NoDa Victoria and the Refrain.

279
00:14:21.425 --> 00:14:24.405
So it was a song all about God's victory, the hymn

280
00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:27.045
of victory, the God's victory in our lives.

281
00:14:27.625 --> 00:14:31.085
And the refrain was de ultra canto,

282
00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:34.125
which means from the other side, I sing

283
00:14:35.035 --> 00:14:37.645
that he was singing this hymn of victory from the other side

284
00:14:37.865 --> 00:14:40.805
of the sea, from the other side of rescue.

285
00:14:41.745 --> 00:14:44.005
And we see that in this psalm as well.

286
00:14:44.005 --> 00:14:47.485
In fact, many times in our own minds, we can go back

287
00:14:47.905 --> 00:14:49.205
to those places of victory,

288
00:14:49.295 --> 00:14:51.365
where we see the Lord's sovereignty

289
00:14:51.915 --> 00:14:55.285
that maybe we didn't see at that time, that we go back to

290
00:14:55.285 --> 00:14:56.925
where we see his victory in our lives.

291
00:14:57.665 --> 00:15:01.445
And we remember how God has worked as a family.

292
00:15:02.065 --> 00:15:04.525
We keep a, we keep picture books from vacations.

293
00:15:04.545 --> 00:15:06.525
And so we can go back and remember the good times

294
00:15:06.995 --> 00:15:09.285
that we've had as we've traveled as a church.

295
00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:12.445
Um, just last month we celebrated 60 years.

296
00:15:12.465 --> 00:15:15.605
We, we celebrated all the good works that God has done

297
00:15:15.995 --> 00:15:19.045
through our fellowship over this time of the victories one.

298
00:15:19.045 --> 00:15:21.485
And we, and we look at it from the other side

299
00:15:23.145 --> 00:15:27.565
as we move into to verse nine here, the Psalmist writes,

300
00:15:28.265 --> 00:15:31.485
he who has kept our soul among the living

301
00:15:31.745 --> 00:15:33.885
and has not let our feet slip.

302
00:15:36.155 --> 00:15:39.805
He's talking about death, that God didn't let them die.

303
00:15:40.545 --> 00:15:43.445
And you see, he understands that the right penalty,

304
00:15:43.665 --> 00:15:46.085
the deserved penalty for the idolatry

305
00:15:46.085 --> 00:15:48.485
and sin of the nation of Israel would've been death.

306
00:15:49.065 --> 00:15:51.605
It would've been for God to let their feet slip.

307
00:15:53.345 --> 00:15:57.245
But in God's grace and by his mercy, they've been spared.

308
00:15:58.025 --> 00:15:59.805
God redeemed them, he rescued them.

309
00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:03.885
In this verse, we are reminded today that the wages

310
00:16:03.885 --> 00:16:05.085
of sin is death.

311
00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:09.805
But the saving work

312
00:16:09.805 --> 00:16:12.285
of Jesus Christ keeps our feet from slipping.

313
00:16:12.675 --> 00:16:14.605
Without God sending his son,

314
00:16:14.945 --> 00:16:16.365
our feet would've surely slipped

315
00:16:16.365 --> 00:16:17.885
and we'd be eternally separated.

316
00:16:19.305 --> 00:16:23.445
But God and his perfect mercy sent his son Jesus

317
00:16:23.705 --> 00:16:27.405
to rescue us, to rescue us from the

318
00:16:27.405 --> 00:16:28.685
penalty of sin and death.

319
00:16:28.705 --> 00:16:30.805
And it changes everything about our lives.

320
00:16:31.905 --> 00:16:33.565
It changes our perspective on God.

321
00:16:33.585 --> 00:16:35.165
It changes our perspective on life.

322
00:16:36.585 --> 00:16:37.645
And the nation of Israel,

323
00:16:38.055 --> 00:16:40.245
after they were rescued, their relationship

324
00:16:40.245 --> 00:16:43.445
with God changed, their perspective with God changed.

325
00:16:43.465 --> 00:16:45.325
And the same can be true of us as well.

326
00:16:46.815 --> 00:16:48.565
After we are rescued from sin

327
00:16:48.565 --> 00:16:52.125
and death, our relationship with God changes

328
00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:54.965
and our perspective on God changes.

329
00:16:57.225 --> 00:17:00.285
The next corporate deed that we see the psalmist praise God

330
00:17:00.585 --> 00:17:03.325
for is his refining of his people.

331
00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:08.645
God's refining of his people. He writes this in verse 10.

332
00:17:08.645 --> 00:17:10.605
He says, for you, oh, God have tested us.

333
00:17:11.305 --> 00:17:13.165
You have tried us as silver as tried.

334
00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:14.645
You've brought us into the net.

335
00:17:15.065 --> 00:17:17.205
You laid a crushing burden on our backs.

336
00:17:17.305 --> 00:17:19.285
You let men ride over our heads.

337
00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:21.965
And we went through fire and through water.

338
00:17:23.425 --> 00:17:26.925
You see, he recognizes the trials that they've been through.

339
00:17:27.705 --> 00:17:30.525
He calls 'em what they are. They're hard crushing weights.

340
00:17:31.625 --> 00:17:33.925
But then he also recognizes that it's for their good,

341
00:17:34.635 --> 00:17:38.125
that he's brought them through that it's a refining

342
00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:40.085
and a testing the same way silver's tested.

343
00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:43.605
So he starts with silver. Silver is refined

344
00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:47.325
through a heating up process in a crucible we call it

345
00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:49.250
that there's heat that's applied.

346
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.365
And so it separates the impurities from the pure silver.

347
00:17:53.265 --> 00:17:55.765
And that same thing can happen in our lives as well, right?

348
00:17:56.945 --> 00:17:58.245
Our lives can heat up.

349
00:17:58.955 --> 00:18:01.445
Sometimes it's through busyness that we take on.

350
00:18:02.195 --> 00:18:04.205
Sometimes it's through the pressure of the world

351
00:18:04.205 --> 00:18:08.045
that can feel like a crushing weight on our backs.

352
00:18:09.185 --> 00:18:12.645
But in the lives of a believer, that weight can be refining.

353
00:18:12.665 --> 00:18:15.205
It causes us to clinging to what is most vital.

354
00:18:16.065 --> 00:18:17.405
We don't have room for anything else.

355
00:18:17.705 --> 00:18:22.285
Theros gets burned away And we're left with a pure faith.

356
00:18:24.545 --> 00:18:27.885
The valuable parts are what gets left through a testing.

357
00:18:28.505 --> 00:18:30.325
And that's true with us as believer, as well,

358
00:18:31.065 --> 00:18:34.765
the psalmist rights of being caught in the net or the trap.

359
00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:38.045
And for the nation of Israel,

360
00:18:38.045 --> 00:18:39.925
this looked a lot like the trials that they faced

361
00:18:39.925 --> 00:18:42.565
during the time of the judges when they tried

362
00:18:42.565 --> 00:18:46.165
to go their own way or or rebel against God.

363
00:18:46.985 --> 00:18:49.605
And there were times of, of trial

364
00:18:49.705 --> 00:18:53.325
and times of oppression, times of trouble that we see later.

365
00:18:53.385 --> 00:18:56.725
He calls it. There were times that they tried to run ahead

366
00:18:57.225 --> 00:18:59.205
of God in their own plans, in their own ways.

367
00:19:02.025 --> 00:19:05.925
And he speaks of men writing over their heads.

368
00:19:06.905 --> 00:19:09.365
And we see in scripture the nation of Israel being captive

369
00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:11.245
to many different empires, right?

370
00:19:11.345 --> 00:19:15.165
To the Egyptians, to the Assyrians, to the Babylonians,

371
00:19:15.165 --> 00:19:17.645
and ultimately to the Romans, that these people

372
00:19:17.645 --> 00:19:21.725
of God felt an oppression, but it caused them to focus

373
00:19:23.385 --> 00:19:26.805
or should have cleansing and refining their faith.

374
00:19:28.865 --> 00:19:32.165
But the end, we see that God didn't leave them there, right?

375
00:19:32.225 --> 00:19:36.525
He didn't leave them in that place. He brings them out.

376
00:19:36.785 --> 00:19:40.165
The Psalm says He brings them out, he into abundance.

377
00:19:41.345 --> 00:19:44.725
And so we see that we praise God for his provision.

378
00:19:45.795 --> 00:19:48.805
Last week, Perry talked about in Psalm 65,

379
00:19:48.945 --> 00:19:50.365
the different words of abundance.

380
00:19:50.465 --> 00:19:52.085
And I underline those as we were going

381
00:19:52.085 --> 00:19:55.125
through the different words of enriching and abundantly

382
00:19:55.145 --> 00:19:58.765
and bounty and overflowing that God provides for his people.

383
00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:03.525
You see, the psalmist here says that you have led us out

384
00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:07.005
to a place of abundance that God provides,

385
00:20:07.465 --> 00:20:08.765
and he provides abundantly.

386
00:20:10.345 --> 00:20:12.205
Now, if you're like me and you've been to vbs

387
00:20:12.205 --> 00:20:13.205
and you've been to church camp,

388
00:20:13.205 --> 00:20:15.365
you can't hear the word abundantly without thinking about

389
00:20:15.365 --> 00:20:20.165
what verse John 10 10, right?

390
00:20:21.025 --> 00:20:23.405
The thief comes to steal and kill and destroy.

391
00:20:23.825 --> 00:20:26.285
But I've come that they may have life

392
00:20:26.285 --> 00:20:29.845
and have it abundantly, that Jesus has come to provide

393
00:20:29.845 --> 00:20:31.205
that life for us.

394
00:20:31.945 --> 00:20:35.965
He loves us, and he sent his son to die for us.

395
00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:39.165
But you see, it can be hard sometimes.

396
00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:41.885
It can be hard in the midst of the fire.

397
00:20:42.545 --> 00:20:44.285
It can be hard in the midst of the water.

398
00:20:44.865 --> 00:20:48.685
It can be hard under the crushing weight to see

399
00:20:48.745 --> 00:20:49.885
how God might be working.

400
00:20:50.705 --> 00:20:52.725
And so it's even more important for us

401
00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:57.525
to look at his goodness in the things of the past, to see

402
00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:59.445
how he has proven himself true

403
00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:02.045
and faithful throughout scripture

404
00:21:02.745 --> 00:21:04.805
and throughout the lives of brothers and sisters around us.

405
00:21:05.105 --> 00:21:08.725
And we see this play out every year about this time of year

406
00:21:08.735 --> 00:21:11.845
where high school seniors are graduating, right?

407
00:21:11.845 --> 00:21:13.205
They're giving their final speeches

408
00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:15.565
and they're talking about how those four years were really

409
00:21:15.635 --> 00:21:19.045
hard, but yet they were really good in the end.

410
00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:20.685
And I see this in my life.

411
00:21:20.765 --> 00:21:23.005
I I, I work in a residency training program

412
00:21:23.065 --> 00:21:26.245
that's a really hard five years for men

413
00:21:26.245 --> 00:21:27.565
and women training the surgeons.

414
00:21:27.565 --> 00:21:28.565
But when they get to the end

415
00:21:29.225 --> 00:21:33.205
and they're giving their graduation speech, they acknowledge

416
00:21:33.595 --> 00:21:35.125
that what they went through was hard,

417
00:21:35.945 --> 00:21:38.165
but they're really glad that they did.

418
00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:39.725
They're thankful for it.

419
00:21:41.065 --> 00:21:42.765
And the same can be true of the trials

420
00:21:42.765 --> 00:21:44.085
that we are facing today.

421
00:21:46.385 --> 00:21:48.925
If we look back at God's awesome deeds

422
00:21:48.985 --> 00:21:52.245
and praise him for his rescue, his refining

423
00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:56.465
and his provision, then we can have hope for today.

424
00:21:58.565 --> 00:22:01.065
And in the ending verses, the psalmist makes a shift.

425
00:22:01.725 --> 00:22:05.145
So he shifts from looking at the corporate at the nation

426
00:22:05.145 --> 00:22:06.865
of Israel, their corporate rescue,

427
00:22:07.085 --> 00:22:09.505
and refining to looking at the individual.

428
00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:12.745
So let's turn our attention to chapter to verse 13.

429
00:22:14.365 --> 00:22:18.345
He writes, I will come into your house with burnt offerings.

430
00:22:18.945 --> 00:22:22.705
I will perform my vows to you that which my lips uttered

431
00:22:23.045 --> 00:22:25.025
and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.

432
00:22:26.105 --> 00:22:29.185
I will to offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals

433
00:22:29.655 --> 00:22:31.785
with smoke in the sacrifice of rams.

434
00:22:32.085 --> 00:22:34.865
And I'll make an offering of bulls and goats.

435
00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:39.465
You see, in the midst of these corporate stories, there are,

436
00:22:39.495 --> 00:22:42.865
like we said, always individual ones, individual lives

437
00:22:42.865 --> 00:22:45.665
that are changed as part of this grand narrative.

438
00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:48.025
So if we look at Texas a

439
00:22:48.025 --> 00:22:49.625
and m, there's all these rich traditions.

440
00:22:50.685 --> 00:22:53.945
But as I walk through, I had my own experience.

441
00:22:55.045 --> 00:22:57.465
One of my favorite memories, my personal memories,

442
00:22:57.465 --> 00:22:59.745
is proposing to Julie under the century tree.

443
00:23:00.565 --> 00:23:01.625
So the century, right?

444
00:23:02.205 --> 00:23:06.785
So the century tree whoop, right, is a,

445
00:23:07.045 --> 00:23:08.465
is a, it is an old oak tree

446
00:23:08.465 --> 00:23:10.345
that spans over a sidewalk, right?

447
00:23:10.345 --> 00:23:11.305
And you don't walk under it

448
00:23:11.645 --> 00:23:12.985
unless you're popping the question.

449
00:23:14.085 --> 00:23:16.665
Um, and if you do, then that's a bad deal.

450
00:23:16.965 --> 00:23:21.425
But, but, but in that day, on that rainy day in October, uh,

451
00:23:21.645 --> 00:23:24.065
we sat under that tree and I asked her to be my wife.

452
00:23:24.085 --> 00:23:26.585
And so we have a memory of that.

453
00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:30.345
We have a painting of that tree that hangs in our home,

454
00:23:31.125 --> 00:23:33.345
or at least it did before our last remodel.

455
00:23:33.685 --> 00:23:37.705
And it, it's somewhere else now, but, but we remember it.

456
00:23:37.705 --> 00:23:38.745
Maybe we'll dig it back out.

457
00:23:39.685 --> 00:23:43.625
So we remember those sweet times, those individual stories,

458
00:23:45.585 --> 00:23:48.525
and they allow us, those individual stories allow us

459
00:23:48.665 --> 00:23:51.325
to resonate that, that

460
00:23:51.525 --> 00:23:54.085
although we walk through these hard times, God is looking

461
00:23:54.265 --> 00:23:55.645
and he's looking just at me.

462
00:23:56.705 --> 00:24:00.285
But as we read these verses, let's not fall into the snare

463
00:24:00.285 --> 00:24:01.565
or to the trap that this,

464
00:24:01.715 --> 00:24:04.045
this psalm is somehow made a deal with God.

465
00:24:05.815 --> 00:24:08.565
Let's not, let's not fall into that trap to think

466
00:24:08.565 --> 00:24:11.525
that he somehow was able to manipulate God by saying,

467
00:24:11.965 --> 00:24:13.525
I will perform all these vows,

468
00:24:14.865 --> 00:24:18.685
but let us not stop short of also considering

469
00:24:19.275 --> 00:24:22.605
that God may have allowed these trials to run up to

470
00:24:22.605 --> 00:24:26.325
that point, to that point of refining in his life,

471
00:24:26.345 --> 00:24:29.125
to the point of desperation, to bringing him to his knees,

472
00:24:29.855 --> 00:24:32.405
where he had nothing else to rely on but to God

473
00:24:32.825 --> 00:24:35.525
and to profess his faith and his trust in God.

474
00:24:35.585 --> 00:24:37.765
So I believe that that's the praise of these verses,

475
00:24:38.235 --> 00:24:41.565
that the psalmist was brought to a place of brokenness,

476
00:24:42.035 --> 00:24:44.845
that the only thing he could look and trust to was God.

477
00:24:44.845 --> 00:24:47.285
And so he put his hope in him and in him alone.

478
00:24:47.465 --> 00:24:50.405
And that created a worship inside of him, a worship

479
00:24:50.465 --> 00:24:52.445
of praise to where he was vowing

480
00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:55.765
to bring these sacrifices to the altar.

481
00:24:56.585 --> 00:24:59.285
And so he turns the praise to the personal story.

482
00:24:59.745 --> 00:25:03.325
And we see personal pronouns all over these verses.

483
00:25:04.385 --> 00:25:08.405
In verses uh, 15 through 20. He says these words.

484
00:25:08.545 --> 00:25:11.405
He says, come and hear all you who fear God.

485
00:25:11.425 --> 00:25:13.685
And I will tell you what he has done for my soul.

486
00:25:14.845 --> 00:25:16.445
I cried to him with my mouth

487
00:25:16.465 --> 00:25:18.245
and high praise was on my tongue.

488
00:25:19.265 --> 00:25:21.845
If I had cherished iniquity in my heart,

489
00:25:22.465 --> 00:25:24.045
the Lord would not have listened.

490
00:25:24.705 --> 00:25:26.325
But truly God has listened.

491
00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:30.485
He has attended to the voice of my prayer, blessed be God

492
00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:32.765
because he has not rejected my prayer

493
00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:36.485
or removed his steadfast love from me.

494
00:25:38.145 --> 00:25:40.205
Now, there's a verse we need to clarify in here as well.

495
00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:44.285
Verse 18. It says, if I had cherished iniquity in my heart,

496
00:25:44.285 --> 00:25:46.165
the Lord would not have listened.

497
00:25:46.665 --> 00:25:47.925
So what does that mean? Does that mean

498
00:25:47.925 --> 00:25:50.165
that God doesn't listen to our prayers if we're sinners?

499
00:25:52.155 --> 00:25:55.175
No, he absolutely listens to the prayers of sinners

500
00:25:55.255 --> 00:25:58.975
because we are all sinners and he listens to our prayers.

501
00:25:59.115 --> 00:26:01.455
But what he's saying is that we are

502
00:26:01.455 --> 00:26:03.695
to give our whole heart to God.

503
00:26:04.185 --> 00:26:05.575
There isn't any sin.

504
00:26:05.585 --> 00:26:09.375
There isn't any iniquity that we can hold back from God.

505
00:26:09.995 --> 00:26:11.815
He tells us that we can't cherish those things.

506
00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:14.095
We, we can't cherish the things of the world.

507
00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:17.615
We have to lay them all at the foot of the cross.

508
00:26:19.675 --> 00:26:23.375
And so we turn our attention to, we see in these verses,

509
00:26:24.275 --> 00:26:27.295
God showing his love for the psalmist.

510
00:26:27.295 --> 00:26:30.535
So we praise God for loving me.

511
00:26:31.255 --> 00:26:33.815
I would say praise God for loving me.

512
00:26:33.915 --> 00:26:35.855
Not because I've deserved it, but

513
00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:38.295
because of his love that he has poured out.

514
00:26:38.955 --> 00:26:43.645
And this is how the Psalmist closes out this song in love

515
00:26:44.315 --> 00:26:47.685
that he sings of the love for the nation of Israel.

516
00:26:48.825 --> 00:26:51.605
But he also sings of his love for me.

517
00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:54.445
And we see that love on display.

518
00:26:55.465 --> 00:26:58.685
Moving up in the text, we see the Psalmist praise God

519
00:26:58.785 --> 00:27:01.085
for welcoming his prayer.

520
00:27:03.825 --> 00:27:07.765
God is on his throne, but it's a throne of grace.

521
00:27:08.665 --> 00:27:11.885
And he welcomes the prayers of his children.

522
00:27:12.305 --> 00:27:15.805
He longs for that relationship for us to share with him.

523
00:27:15.805 --> 00:27:18.845
There's a welcome Matt at the foot of the cross.

524
00:27:20.065 --> 00:27:21.325
He welcomes our prayers.

525
00:27:22.465 --> 00:27:24.525
And finally, the psalmist praises God.

526
00:27:24.705 --> 00:27:27.725
He says, praise God for attending to my soul.

527
00:27:28.745 --> 00:27:31.005
And we too can say, praise you God,

528
00:27:31.545 --> 00:27:33.045
for attending to my soul.

529
00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:35.245
So not only does God love,

530
00:27:35.665 --> 00:27:37.085
and not only does God welcome,

531
00:27:38.375 --> 00:27:40.405
which you in some ways abstract things,

532
00:27:40.825 --> 00:27:45.405
but the Psalmist points to God's attending to his soul

533
00:27:46.905 --> 00:27:49.645
in the, in the Spanish service in H-H-B-C-S pen.

534
00:27:49.735 --> 00:27:51.285
We've been studying the fruits of the Spirit.

535
00:27:52.505 --> 00:27:54.565
And the last two weeks we've talked about kindness

536
00:27:54.865 --> 00:27:56.925
and goodness and the,

537
00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:58.845
and there's similarities between those two,

538
00:27:59.185 --> 00:28:00.485
but also some distinctions.

539
00:28:00.485 --> 00:28:03.525
And in English and in Spanish, those words have a lot

540
00:28:03.525 --> 00:28:05.485
of overlap and even sometimes used

541
00:28:05.945 --> 00:28:07.485
interchangeably in scripture.

542
00:28:09.025 --> 00:28:11.285
But there's a difference. There's a distinction in kindness

543
00:28:11.815 --> 00:28:15.565
where it's an outward expression of care for another person.

544
00:28:16.905 --> 00:28:19.245
And that's what I think about when I read this word, attends

545
00:28:19.265 --> 00:28:23.525
to my soul that someone who attends is present, right?

546
00:28:23.875 --> 00:28:26.805
When God attends to our soul, he's present in our lives.

547
00:28:27.395 --> 00:28:28.605
When someone attends

548
00:28:28.785 --> 00:28:31.245
or attends to a plant, they care for it.

549
00:28:31.425 --> 00:28:33.565
God cares for our lives.

550
00:28:34.905 --> 00:28:38.725
And so we praise God for that, for the individual care

551
00:28:38.865 --> 00:28:41.805
and attention that he gives to us.

552
00:28:43.065 --> 00:28:45.325
So let me tell you what God has done in my life.

553
00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:49.205
So there's a collective story of God in scripture

554
00:28:49.225 --> 00:28:51.005
of the Holy Spirit, redeeming people,

555
00:28:52.035 --> 00:28:53.725
calling them to repentance.

556
00:28:53.725 --> 00:28:55.405
And that story is grand, right?

557
00:28:55.865 --> 00:28:58.045
It spans nations and centuries.

558
00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:02.645
But also God has spoken to my life.

559
00:29:04.025 --> 00:29:07.285
My story is one of hearing from the Spirit very clearly

560
00:29:07.825 --> 00:29:10.565
and very surely at a summer camp

561
00:29:11.785 --> 00:29:13.005
in Sky Ranch, Texas.

562
00:29:14.465 --> 00:29:18.405
And the Holy Spirit convicted me of my sin, told me

563
00:29:18.405 --> 00:29:20.285
of my need for a savior,

564
00:29:22.065 --> 00:29:25.765
and then opened my heart to the reality of the free gift

565
00:29:25.765 --> 00:29:27.765
of God laid before me.

566
00:29:29.245 --> 00:29:32.165
I knew that there was a need for a prayer of submission,

567
00:29:34.385 --> 00:29:37.245
but in that time, I, I wasn't quite ready, right?

568
00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:42.085
But God continued to sing to my soul with words of grace.

569
00:29:43.105 --> 00:29:46.805
And then I remember at Williams Memorial United Methodist

570
00:29:46.805 --> 00:29:51.205
Church in Texarkana, Texas, kneeling at the communion real

571
00:29:52.225 --> 00:29:55.725
and offering that prayer of submission to God,

572
00:29:57.035 --> 00:30:00.005
accepting the free gift of Christ is my Savior,

573
00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:04.925
and then giving him control over my life.

574
00:30:07.065 --> 00:30:11.325
And it's been the greatest 35 years of whooping ever since.

575
00:30:11.755 --> 00:30:15.325
Amen? Amen. Now, there have been times of trials.

576
00:30:15.745 --> 00:30:18.885
Yes, there have been times of testing

577
00:30:19.185 --> 00:30:21.605
and refining times of walking through fire

578
00:30:21.785 --> 00:30:24.685
and water, it seemed and crushing weights.

579
00:30:26.505 --> 00:30:29.805
But as the psalmist would say, I would say to you today,

580
00:30:29.875 --> 00:30:32.325
come and hear all who fear God.

581
00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:34.845
And I will tell you what he has done for my soul.

582
00:30:35.885 --> 00:30:37.605
I cried to him with my mouth

583
00:30:37.665 --> 00:30:39.325
and high praise was on my tongue.

584
00:30:40.145 --> 00:30:42.165
If I had cherished iniquity in my heart,

585
00:30:42.185 --> 00:30:44.125
the Lord would not have listened.

586
00:30:45.025 --> 00:30:46.845
But God truly has listened.

587
00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:49.605
He has attended the voice of my prayer.

588
00:30:49.605 --> 00:30:52.445
Blessed be God because he has not rejected my prayer

589
00:30:52.905 --> 00:30:56.325
or removed his steadfast love, love from me.
