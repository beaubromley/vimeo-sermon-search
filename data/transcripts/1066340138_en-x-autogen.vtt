00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:20.485
Oh, good morning church.

2
00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:23.605
Good morning. Thank you. This half.

3
00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:28.005
My name is Dan Leaphart.

4
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.645
I'm an elder here at Henderson Hills

5
00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:32.445
and it's so good to be with you this morning.

6
00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:36.165
It's so good to be able to bring God's word

7
00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:41.645
to you this morning, not why we're here to worship him.

8
00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:42.845
Thank you to the worship team

9
00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:47.445
and wow, what a privilege it is to be able

10
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:52.285
to preach for the first time, uh, here today.

11
00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:54.725
So before I open God's word, though,

12
00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:56.445
I have a question for you.

13
00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:01.925
May sound a little odd, but it's a simple question

14
00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:05.445
and it's this, where are you?

15
00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:13.015
Where are you now? I see you sitting there.

16
00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:16.215
So I don't mean physically. Where are you?

17
00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:21.405
I mean, really, where are you?

18
00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:26.565
Um, have you ever been in a conversation with somebody

19
00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:30.125
and though they're just a couple of feet away, you can tell

20
00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.645
after a while maybe they're not really there,

21
00:01:34.515 --> 00:01:35.605
they're somewhere else.

22
00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.285
It's probably never happened to you before.

23
00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.205
I'm sure it hasn't. Uh,

24
00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:42.205
but you've been told

25
00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:46.765
that you can't be in two places at the same time.

26
00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:48.445
But that just isn't true, is it?

27
00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:52.005
See, we're often in two places

28
00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:55.365
or more than one place at any given time.

29
00:01:56.625 --> 00:02:00.485
The reason for that is we're more than just a physical body.

30
00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:05.805
Jesus even alluded to this in Matthew 15,

31
00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:08.805
verse eight, quoting Isaiah.

32
00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:13.285
He says, this, people honors me with their lips,

33
00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:19.455
but their heart is what far from me?

34
00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:24.905
So we can be in more than one place at at any given time.

35
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:27.985
So I'll ask you again now that we were onto this.

36
00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:30.665
Where are you today?

37
00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:37.405
Now, when you wanna measure the distance

38
00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:41.925
between two objects, you might get a tape measure

39
00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:45.605
or something like this to measure that distance.

40
00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:48.925
But how do you tell the distance?

41
00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:51.765
How do you measure the distance between two hearts?

42
00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:55.485
How do you measure the distance

43
00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:57.165
between your heart and God's heart?

44
00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:01.525
We're going to open God's word

45
00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:05.725
and we're going to look for clues as to where

46
00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:09.125
certain people are in their relation to God.

47
00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:12.885
And then we're gonna bring it back and we're gonna try

48
00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:16.525
and determine where we are in our relation to God.

49
00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:22.405
So turn with me now to one Samuel 26.

50
00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:24.965
That's where we're gonna be reading from today.

51
00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:32.045
If you've been tracking along in this series on one Samuel

52
00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:34.365
and the life of David,

53
00:03:35.305 --> 00:03:37.565
you'll know we're nearing the end of the book.

54
00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:43.155
Saul is presently king in Israel

55
00:03:44.465 --> 00:03:46.285
and his spiritual

56
00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:48.795
and his political, uh,

57
00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:51.395
life at this point is in decline, right?

58
00:03:51.405 --> 00:03:53.515
We've seen that over the last several chapters.

59
00:03:54.085 --> 00:03:56.515
David has been anointed king,

60
00:03:58.995 --> 00:04:02.575
but he's presently on the run from Saul who's seeking

61
00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:04.855
to kill him to take his life.

62
00:04:05.515 --> 00:04:08.775
So we're gonna pick it up here in one Samuel 26.

63
00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.455
I'm gonna read the whole chapter for us

64
00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:15.615
and then we are gonna come back and dive in.

65
00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:21.855
So one Samuel 26, then the Z fights came

66
00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:25.975
to Saul at Gibbon saying is not David hiding himself on the

67
00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:29.255
hill of Haah, which is on the east of Jeon.

68
00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:32.975
So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziff

69
00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:35.255
with 3000 chosen men of Israel

70
00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:37.295
to seek David in the wilderness of Ziff.

71
00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:42.695
And Saul camped on the hill of Haah, which is

72
00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:45.255
beside the road on the east of Jeon.

73
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:50.055
But David remained in the wilderness when he saw

74
00:04:50.085 --> 00:04:52.855
that Saul had came after him into the wilderness.

75
00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:56.575
David sent out spies and learned that Saul had indeed come.

76
00:04:57.925 --> 00:04:58.975
Then David Rose

77
00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:01.775
and came to the place where Saul had encamped

78
00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:04.375
and David Sa, the place where Saul Lay

79
00:05:04.715 --> 00:05:07.815
and Abner the son of Ner and the commander of his army.

80
00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.735
Saul was lying within the encampment while the army

81
00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:13.175
was encamped around him.

82
00:05:14.325 --> 00:05:17.055
Then David said to a Alek, the Hittite,

83
00:05:17.235 --> 00:05:20.255
and to Joe Abs brother Abishai, the son of Aya

84
00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:23.855
who will go down with me into the camp to Saul

85
00:05:24.755 --> 00:05:27.015
and Abishai said, I will go down with you.

86
00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:31.175
So David and Abishai went to the army by night and Saul

87
00:05:31.995 --> 00:05:34.535
and their lay Saul sleeping within the encampment

88
00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:38.695
with his spear stuck in the ground at his head and Abner

89
00:05:38.795 --> 00:05:40.215
and the army lay around him.

90
00:05:41.605 --> 00:05:43.135
Then Abishai said to David,

91
00:05:43.755 --> 00:05:46.095
God has given your enemy into your hand this day.

92
00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:49.175
Now please let me pin him to the earth with one stroke

93
00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:51.655
of the spear and I will not strike twice.

94
00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:56.255
But David said to Abishai, do not destroy him for

95
00:05:56.275 --> 00:05:58.365
who can put out his hand against the Lord's

96
00:05:58.485 --> 00:06:00.245
anointed and be guiltless.

97
00:06:01.435 --> 00:06:04.415
And David said, as the Lord lives, the Lord will strike him,

98
00:06:04.435 --> 00:06:06.015
or his day will come to die,

99
00:06:06.555 --> 00:06:08.775
or he will go down into battle and perish.

100
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:12.335
The Lord forbid that I should put out my hand against the

101
00:06:12.335 --> 00:06:15.775
Lord's anointed, but take now the spear that is at his head

102
00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:17.695
and the jar of water and let us go.

103
00:06:20.115 --> 00:06:21.415
So David took the spear

104
00:06:21.475 --> 00:06:25.015
and the jar of water from Saul's head and they went away.

105
00:06:25.195 --> 00:06:26.575
No man saw it or knew it,

106
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:29.295
nor did any awake for they were all asleep

107
00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:32.055
because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.

108
00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:35.655
Then David went over to the other side

109
00:06:35.655 --> 00:06:38.615
and stood far off on the top of a hill with a great space

110
00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:41.535
between them and David called to the army

111
00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:43.655
and to Abner, the son of nurse saying,

112
00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:45.695
will you not answer Abner?

113
00:06:46.845 --> 00:06:49.535
Then Abner answered, who are you who calls to the king?

114
00:06:50.795 --> 00:06:53.365
And David said to Abner, are you not a man

115
00:06:53.985 --> 00:06:55.245
who was like you in Israel?

116
00:06:55.785 --> 00:06:58.605
Why then have you not kept watch over your Lord the king,

117
00:06:59.425 --> 00:07:02.205
for one of the people came in to destroy the king your Lord,

118
00:07:02.635 --> 00:07:03.925
this thing which you have not,

119
00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:07.485
which you have done is not good as the Lord lives,

120
00:07:07.585 --> 00:07:10.605
you deserve to die because you have not kept watch over your

121
00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:12.685
Lord the Lord's anointed

122
00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:15.645
and now see where the king's spear is

123
00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:17.885
and the jar of water that was at his head.

124
00:07:19.755 --> 00:07:21.325
Saul recognized David's voice

125
00:07:21.385 --> 00:07:24.005
and said, is this your voice, my son David?

126
00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:27.805
And David said, it is my voice, my Lord oh king.

127
00:07:29.055 --> 00:07:32.435
And he said, why does my Lord pursue after his servant?

128
00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:33.675
For what have I done?

129
00:07:34.545 --> 00:07:37.275
What evil is on my hands now

130
00:07:37.275 --> 00:07:39.155
therefore, let my Lord the king hear

131
00:07:39.155 --> 00:07:40.235
the words of his servant.

132
00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:43.595
If it is the Lord who has stirred you up against me,

133
00:07:43.615 --> 00:07:44.875
may he accept an offering.

134
00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:48.715
But if it is men, may they be cursed before the Lord.

135
00:07:49.055 --> 00:07:51.075
For they have driven me out this day

136
00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:52.995
that I should have no share in the heritage

137
00:07:53.015 --> 00:07:56.955
of the Lord saying, go serve other gods

138
00:07:58.815 --> 00:08:00.875
now therefore, let not my blood fall

139
00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:02.755
to the earth away from the presence of the Lord.

140
00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.595
For the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea

141
00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:09.315
like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.

142
00:08:10.755 --> 00:08:13.245
Then Saul said, I have sinned.

143
00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:16.805
Return my son David for I will no more. Do you harm?

144
00:08:16.805 --> 00:08:19.645
Because my life was precious in your eyes this day,

145
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.885
behold I have acted foolishly and have made a great mistake.

146
00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:28.645
And David answered and said, here is the Spiro King.

147
00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:30.805
Let one of the young men come over and take it.

148
00:08:31.665 --> 00:08:34.285
The Lord rewards every man for his righteousness

149
00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:37.045
and his faithfulness for the Lord gave you into my hand

150
00:08:37.045 --> 00:08:40.685
today and I would not put out my hand against the Lord's

151
00:08:40.805 --> 00:08:42.645
anointed Behold,

152
00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:45.045
as your life was precious this day in my sight.

153
00:08:45.145 --> 00:08:47.965
So may my life be precious in the sight of the Lord

154
00:08:48.865 --> 00:08:52.205
and may he deliver me out of all tribulation.

155
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:57.045
Then Saul said to David, blessed be you my son David.

156
00:08:57.265 --> 00:08:59.605
You will do many things and will succeed in them.

157
00:09:00.385 --> 00:09:04.405
So David went his way and Saul returned to his place.

158
00:09:09.065 --> 00:09:12.365
So if you look in the ESV,

159
00:09:13.795 --> 00:09:18.085
there's a chapter heading that says David spares Saul

160
00:09:19.135 --> 00:09:23.165
again, seems like we've been here before, haven't we?

161
00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:25.805
If you remember two chapters ago

162
00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:31.505
that chapter heading said, David spares Saul's life,

163
00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:34.505
and now here is the sequel to that story.

164
00:09:35.525 --> 00:09:37.265
So that while there are similarities,

165
00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:40.545
I think we'll find fresh application here in chapter 26.

166
00:09:44.925 --> 00:09:48.465
Verses one to five really set the stage for us.

167
00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:54.025
David must not have learned that the Z fights were not

168
00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:56.705
as friends stay away from the Z fights,

169
00:09:56.795 --> 00:09:58.105
David, they're not your friends.

170
00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:02.585
So the Z fights again rat out David to Saul

171
00:10:03.005 --> 00:10:05.545
and this time Saul brings an army of 3000 men.

172
00:10:06.895 --> 00:10:11.105
Okay? That's the setting that we're in here in chapter 26.

173
00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:18.145
If your Bible has cross references, you may see

174
00:10:18.905 --> 00:10:21.785
a little cross-reference in verse one that points you

175
00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:23.625
to one Samuel 2319.

176
00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:26.425
That's the very first encounter with the Phis

177
00:10:27.075 --> 00:10:29.545
where they first rat out David to Saul.

178
00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:35.305
But you also may see a little cross reference

179
00:10:35.485 --> 00:10:36.825
to Psalm 54.

180
00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:42.915
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to Psalm 54,

181
00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:44.475
turn there with me if you will

182
00:10:45.505 --> 00:10:47.595
keep a finger in one Samuel 26.

183
00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:48.755
We're gonna come back to that,

184
00:10:50.455 --> 00:10:52.635
but we're gonna use this psalm

185
00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:56.075
to determine David's proximity to God

186
00:10:57.465 --> 00:10:59.685
and then we're gonna come back into this passage

187
00:11:00.665 --> 00:11:02.045
and find it being applied.

188
00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:07.485
Okay? So this this, this sermon is really about finding

189
00:11:08.315 --> 00:11:10.765
your position before God.

190
00:11:12.225 --> 00:11:15.075
Okay? So we're gonna find David's position before God

191
00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:16.995
and we're gonna do it in Psalm 54.

192
00:11:17.495 --> 00:11:21.435
Now textually Psalm 54

193
00:11:24.035 --> 00:11:26.475
probably goes better with the first encounter

194
00:11:26.475 --> 00:11:28.595
with the Z fights in one Samuel 23.

195
00:11:29.015 --> 00:11:31.955
But I'm gonna propose to you that it's the same Z fights

196
00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:36.915
ratting out the same David to the same Saul,

197
00:11:38.015 --> 00:11:39.915
and I believe it speaks to the same heart

198
00:11:40.175 --> 00:11:42.995
of David in a very, very similar situation.

199
00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:47.275
So let's go to first, uh, or sorry to Psalm 54

200
00:11:49.255 --> 00:11:51.355
and we're gonna look at this and we're gonna go through it

201
00:11:51.355 --> 00:11:53.565
and we're gonna take note of where David is.

202
00:11:54.105 --> 00:11:57.405
So if you look at the title in Psalm 54, it says

203
00:11:57.585 --> 00:12:02.125
to the choir master with stringed instruments, a masque

204
00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:04.765
of David when the zip fights went

205
00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:07.525
and told Saul, is not David hiding among us?

206
00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:12.045
Okay? But let's look at verse one.

207
00:12:13.225 --> 00:12:16.325
Oh God, save me by your name

208
00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:19.205
and vindicate me by your might.

209
00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:24.405
Now I get why David is crying out

210
00:12:24.405 --> 00:12:28.325
to God saying, save me in this situation,

211
00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:32.525
but why does he mention his name?

212
00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:38.565
Why would he mention his name in this verse?

213
00:12:41.245 --> 00:12:43.265
So we're gonna bring up a a little bit

214
00:12:43.265 --> 00:12:46.785
of a technical note here before we dive in.

215
00:12:46.785 --> 00:12:50.725
Any farther biblical names lots

216
00:12:50.725 --> 00:12:53.725
of times have significant meaning, okay?

217
00:12:54.105 --> 00:12:55.765
And in the original language,

218
00:12:55.865 --> 00:12:59.645
but in the English it often gets lost in translation

219
00:12:59.835 --> 00:13:01.485
including the names of God.

220
00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:04.685
So we're going to go through this

221
00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:06.485
and we're gonna look through it, the names of God.

222
00:13:07.385 --> 00:13:08.805
But first we need

223
00:13:08.885 --> 00:13:10.645
to know a little bit about the original language.

224
00:13:10.705 --> 00:13:13.325
The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew,

225
00:13:13.665 --> 00:13:16.405
not not English, it was written in Hebrew.

226
00:13:16.705 --> 00:13:20.485
And the book of Psalms is uh,

227
00:13:20.485 --> 00:13:22.445
poetry Hebrew poetry.

228
00:13:22.445 --> 00:13:26.045
Hebrew poetry is both very beautiful

229
00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:29.845
and very memorable, okay?

230
00:13:29.845 --> 00:13:33.005
It often takes the form of two lines

231
00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:38.885
or couplets and it there's a line A and a line B.

232
00:13:39.065 --> 00:13:42.845
And line B relates to line A in any one

233
00:13:42.845 --> 00:13:44.325
of a number of different ways.

234
00:13:45.185 --> 00:13:49.965
It can either be, uh, line B can either build upon line A,

235
00:13:50.795 --> 00:13:52.685
line B can either be synonymous

236
00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:56.845
or parallel in thought to line A,

237
00:13:58.105 --> 00:14:00.205
or it could be a consequence of line A

238
00:14:00.265 --> 00:14:04.405
or it could be the opposite, et cetera.

239
00:14:05.665 --> 00:14:09.725
So when we look at verse one, What do we see?

240
00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:13.605
We see that it's a parallel thought.

241
00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:19.765
Save me in line A is parallel to vindicate me in line B.

242
00:14:20.425 --> 00:14:24.405
And your name in line A is parallel to what

243
00:14:26.395 --> 00:14:30.485
your might David sees

244
00:14:31.255 --> 00:14:33.525
might in God's name

245
00:14:35.985 --> 00:14:39.165
he sees and he knows that there's power to save

246
00:14:39.865 --> 00:14:41.465
in God's name.

247
00:14:43.445 --> 00:14:45.265
All right, church, we're gonna have a little fun now we're

248
00:14:45.265 --> 00:14:47.265
gonna go through Psalm 54

249
00:14:47.925 --> 00:14:50.185
and if you like to mark up your Bibles

250
00:14:50.185 --> 00:14:53.645
and I hope that you do get out a pen or a pencil

251
00:14:53.745 --> 00:14:58.285
or a highlighter or little sticky tabs or whatever you do.

252
00:14:59.225 --> 00:15:00.925
And we're gonna go through this psalm,

253
00:15:01.035 --> 00:15:02.965
this short Psalm only seven verses,

254
00:15:02.965 --> 00:15:04.525
and we're gonna look for the names of God

255
00:15:04.525 --> 00:15:07.365
and how they're used, because I believe it carries great

256
00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:11.405
significance to understanding where David is in this moment

257
00:15:12.225 --> 00:15:13.805
as Saul is hunting him down.

258
00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:18.205
Our first name of God is right in verse one,

259
00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:23.785
it's the word God, our English word God, God.

260
00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:25.865
In the Hebrew is

261
00:15:27.405 --> 00:15:30.065
Elohim Elohim.

262
00:15:32.205 --> 00:15:34.545
Elohim speaks to the almighty,

263
00:15:35.465 --> 00:15:38.385
majestic creator God.

264
00:15:38.765 --> 00:15:42.865
In the beginning, Elohim created the heavens and the earth.

265
00:15:45.765 --> 00:15:49.305
Elohim is the almighty, majestic creator God.

266
00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:52.985
And when you see the word God in the Old Testament,

267
00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:56.025
it's almost always this Hebrew word Elohim.

268
00:15:58.265 --> 00:16:01.525
We see Elohim again in verse two and in verse three.

269
00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:03.325
But what I want to do is jump down to verse four.

270
00:16:05.775 --> 00:16:09.845
Verse four says, behold God is my helper.

271
00:16:09.905 --> 00:16:12.845
The Lord is the upholder of my life.

272
00:16:12.845 --> 00:16:16.245
Notice that God is parallel to Lord.

273
00:16:16.425 --> 00:16:17.805
And this word Lord is written

274
00:16:17.865 --> 00:16:20.845
as you normally would write the word Lord as a capital L

275
00:16:21.225 --> 00:16:22.805
and a lowercase ORD.

276
00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:27.645
When you see the word Lord written in that format,

277
00:16:28.915 --> 00:16:33.175
it's the Hebrew word Adonai Adonai.

278
00:16:35.075 --> 00:16:39.295
Adonai is the typical Hebrew word for Lord or master

279
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:42.635
or owner Lord,

280
00:16:43.615 --> 00:16:45.675
master owner.

281
00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:51.745
So let's read this in with what we know

282
00:16:51.765 --> 00:16:52.905
so far about these names.

283
00:16:53.685 --> 00:16:57.745
It says, behold, Elohim is my helper.

284
00:16:57.885 --> 00:16:59.545
Let that sink in for just one moment.

285
00:16:59.565 --> 00:17:04.105
Church, as we interpret this, Elohim, the almighty,

286
00:17:04.185 --> 00:17:05.785
majestic creator, God

287
00:17:09.145 --> 00:17:09.645
is my

288
00:17:09.865 --> 00:17:14.145
helper, he's my helper.

289
00:17:14.145 --> 00:17:17.345
David understood he's my helper, but he is more than that.

290
00:17:17.575 --> 00:17:21.145
He's my Adonai, my Lord, my master

291
00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:25.265
and how he helps is in the form

292
00:17:25.465 --> 00:17:30.465
of upholding my life to

293
00:17:31.145 --> 00:17:33.685
His life was in the master's hand

294
00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:38.405
in completely in the master's hand.

295
00:17:40.745 --> 00:17:42.645
Do you see that parallel there?

296
00:17:43.785 --> 00:17:45.045
So let's go on to verse five.

297
00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:48.925
In verse five, No names of God,

298
00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.885
but we see a positional shift in David.

299
00:17:54.345 --> 00:17:57.045
Notice in the first part of this, in line A,

300
00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.645
we see third person pronouns.

301
00:18:02.475 --> 00:18:06.645
He's speaking to us and he says He, who's he?

302
00:18:06.945 --> 00:18:09.005
The Adonai, my Lord, my master.

303
00:18:09.545 --> 00:18:13.625
He will return the evil to my enemies.

304
00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:14.785
But look at line B.

305
00:18:14.845 --> 00:18:19.265
Now, there's a shift from talking about God to now

306
00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:23.505
standing and gazing directly at God

307
00:18:24.365 --> 00:18:26.025
in the second person pronouns

308
00:18:26.965 --> 00:18:29.705
in your faithfulness put an end to them.

309
00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:35.435
David shifts his gaze directly towards God

310
00:18:36.695 --> 00:18:38.235
and he invites us to do the same

311
00:18:40.725 --> 00:18:41.785
in this situation.

312
00:18:44.055 --> 00:18:49.015
Now let's look at verse six, with a free will offering,

313
00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:53.485
I will sacrifice to you and the parallel.

314
00:18:53.555 --> 00:18:57.565
Line B says, I will give thanks to your name.

315
00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:00.085
Oh Lord, for it is good.

316
00:19:02.095 --> 00:19:03.425
There's that word, Lord, again.

317
00:19:03.425 --> 00:19:07.305
But notice it looks differently than the Lord did in

318
00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:08.945
verse four, doesn't it?

319
00:19:09.975 --> 00:19:11.745
This Lord is in all caps

320
00:19:12.655 --> 00:19:15.625
When we see the Lord in all capital letters in the Old

321
00:19:15.865 --> 00:19:20.145
Testament, it's the divine personal name

322
00:19:20.405 --> 00:19:22.225
of God best rendered

323
00:19:22.885 --> 00:19:25.965
Yahweh, Yahweh.

324
00:19:26.505 --> 00:19:29.085
Now it's debated exactly

325
00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:31.565
what the word Yahweh means.

326
00:19:32.275 --> 00:19:34.205
Lots of times people will say it's related

327
00:19:34.225 --> 00:19:37.685
or derived from the Hebrew verb hayah, which is

328
00:19:38.705 --> 00:19:39.965
to be to exist.

329
00:19:40.105 --> 00:19:42.165
And certainly there's an element of that in the name.

330
00:19:42.635 --> 00:19:46.005
When I've been studying the names of God, the definition

331
00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:47.765
that I've arrived at, I'm gonna share with you,

332
00:19:47.765 --> 00:19:51.325
hopefully it'll be helpful to you, that Yahweh

333
00:19:52.945 --> 00:19:56.005
is the ever present, intimate

334
00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:01.545
saving one, the ever present, intimate

335
00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:07.305
saving one that sounds like a God who's near, doesn't it?

336
00:20:08.815 --> 00:20:13.385
He's near. David even writes later in Psalm 1 45, 18,

337
00:20:14.525 --> 00:20:17.585
Yahweh is near to all who call on him

338
00:20:18.525 --> 00:20:22.025
and building on that line B says to all who call on him.

339
00:20:22.885 --> 00:20:27.865
In truth, one Bible dictionary that I have states this

340
00:20:28.165 --> 00:20:31.785
to call on the name of Yahweh is to confess

341
00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.785
and to be ready for encounter with this person

342
00:20:37.645 --> 00:20:40.385
to call on the name of Yahweh is to confess

343
00:20:40.765 --> 00:20:45.065
and to be ready for encounter with this person.

344
00:20:46.335 --> 00:20:49.245
And that begs the question today, church,

345
00:20:49.425 --> 00:20:50.725
why are you here today?

346
00:20:53.035 --> 00:20:54.215
Why are you here today?

347
00:20:54.635 --> 00:20:58.775
And if I polled everybody, I'm sure we would get lots

348
00:20:58.775 --> 00:21:00.415
of different answers to that question.

349
00:21:01.475 --> 00:21:03.485
But Did you come here today

350
00:21:05.115 --> 00:21:07.175
to encounter God?

351
00:21:09.215 --> 00:21:14.175
I hope that you did. I hope that that is the driving reason.

352
00:21:15.055 --> 00:21:18.015
I pray that's the driving reason of why you are here today.

353
00:21:20.235 --> 00:21:21.295
You see in David the process

354
00:21:21.355 --> 00:21:23.975
of encountering God in this psalm, don't we?

355
00:21:24.035 --> 00:21:26.735
We saw the positional change his usage of his name

356
00:21:26.835 --> 00:21:30.695
as he draws close to God, calling on his name.

357
00:21:31.515 --> 00:21:33.335
All this, keep in mind the situation.

358
00:21:34.465 --> 00:21:36.895
We're gonna flip back to one Samuel 26 here

359
00:21:38.075 --> 00:21:41.615
and you can start turning back here to to one Samuel 26.

360
00:21:41.755 --> 00:21:43.895
But notice the situation that he's in.

361
00:21:44.405 --> 00:21:46.655
He's drawing near to God, calling on his name

362
00:21:46.995 --> 00:21:48.615
and he's near to him.

363
00:21:48.955 --> 00:21:52.495
In this situation where Saul is trying to take his life,

364
00:21:56.135 --> 00:21:58.135
encountering God should change us,

365
00:21:59.535 --> 00:22:01.275
it should change our perspective.

366
00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:04.875
It certainly changed David.

367
00:22:06.935 --> 00:22:09.155
So back in one Samuel 26,

368
00:22:09.285 --> 00:22:13.035
we're gonna pick it up here in verse six, where we left off

369
00:22:13.485 --> 00:22:17.475
after getting a lay of the land, David calls two men over

370
00:22:17.495 --> 00:22:19.675
and he asks for somebody to go with him into Saul's camp.

371
00:22:19.695 --> 00:22:21.155
He calls a him elect to hit tight.

372
00:22:21.155 --> 00:22:22.555
We never hear from him again.

373
00:22:24.025 --> 00:22:28.085
And he calls also Abishai, the son of Aya.

374
00:22:28.865 --> 00:22:30.525
It mentions Joe Abs brother here.

375
00:22:30.525 --> 00:22:32.005
This is the first mention of Abishai.

376
00:22:32.045 --> 00:22:35.525
A little bit about him as he volunteers to go

377
00:22:35.635 --> 00:22:37.365
with David into Saul's camp.

378
00:22:38.195 --> 00:22:42.485
Abishai is actually David's nephew, he's the son

379
00:22:43.305 --> 00:22:45.885
of of David's sister Zaya.

380
00:22:46.585 --> 00:22:49.405
Uh, one resource I've got calls him a fiercely

381
00:22:49.695 --> 00:22:51.245
loyal warrior.

382
00:22:54.085 --> 00:22:56.305
And I think sometimes to a fault he's often a

383
00:22:56.305 --> 00:22:57.345
thorn in David's side.

384
00:22:59.905 --> 00:23:01.885
But let's go with David

385
00:23:01.985 --> 00:23:05.605
and Abishai now into Saul's camp.

386
00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:10.605
Imagine, imagine this, you see,

387
00:23:10.825 --> 00:23:14.805
you come upon in a circle of an army,

388
00:23:15.175 --> 00:23:16.765
3000 men strong

389
00:23:17.945 --> 00:23:21.045
and they're all lying there fast asleep in a circle.

390
00:23:22.015 --> 00:23:24.595
And you can see Saul in the middle of this.

391
00:23:24.815 --> 00:23:27.275
So we're gonna go, we're gonna walk with him.

392
00:23:27.275 --> 00:23:32.115
We're gonna step over all of these sleeping soldiers

393
00:23:33.895 --> 00:23:35.035
and your adrenaline is

394
00:23:35.035 --> 00:23:39.175
rushing, you're sweating.

395
00:23:40.395 --> 00:23:43.015
And abishai is the first to get there to Saul.

396
00:23:43.515 --> 00:23:46.040
And what does he do? What does he say in verse eight?

397
00:23:49.305 --> 00:23:51.045
Let me pin him to the ground.

398
00:23:52.485 --> 00:23:54.965
I will not need to strike him twice. I love that line.

399
00:23:55.955 --> 00:23:58.125
What a great line. I will not strike him twice.

400
00:24:00.645 --> 00:24:03.145
But notice how he invokes the name

401
00:24:03.385 --> 00:24:06.505
of God in this situation.

402
00:24:09.425 --> 00:24:13.605
He says, God has given your enemy into your hand this day.

403
00:24:15.505 --> 00:24:20.125
He invokes, he invokes

404
00:24:22.515 --> 00:24:27.095
Elohim, the Almighty creator God, in this moment

405
00:24:27.835 --> 00:24:32.305
he has given your enemy into your hands.

406
00:24:32.935 --> 00:24:34.185
Hold on to that for a moment.

407
00:24:34.235 --> 00:24:36.985
We'll determine where Abishai is in his relation

408
00:24:36.985 --> 00:24:39.025
to God with those clues.

409
00:24:39.025 --> 00:24:40.865
But notice what David says in verse nine.

410
00:24:42.165 --> 00:24:44.505
He rebuts do not destroy him

411
00:24:45.285 --> 00:24:49.705
and he calls Saul the Lord's anointed in verse nine.

412
00:24:49.765 --> 00:24:51.305
You see that? And that's our word

413
00:24:51.335 --> 00:24:52.545
Lord, but which Lord is it?

414
00:24:52.735 --> 00:24:54.425
It's in all capital letters, isn't it?

415
00:24:56.795 --> 00:24:58.695
Yahweh, Yahweh.

416
00:24:59.395 --> 00:25:02.415
He is Yahweh's anointed.

417
00:25:04.245 --> 00:25:09.105
Notice the name change from Elohim to Yahweh.

418
00:25:12.435 --> 00:25:14.815
We can mark up our Bibles all over the

419
00:25:14.815 --> 00:25:16.135
Old Testament with the names of God.

420
00:25:16.135 --> 00:25:17.815
It's actually a really fun thing to do.

421
00:25:18.835 --> 00:25:22.815
If you have the the the goal to go do that.

422
00:25:22.815 --> 00:25:24.375
You can do it anywhere in the Old Testament,

423
00:25:24.375 --> 00:25:26.495
you can do it back here in one Samuel 26.

424
00:25:28.035 --> 00:25:31.485
What you'll see is that the name Yahweh

425
00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:34.325
actually shows up in this chapter 16

426
00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:36.325
times every single time.

427
00:25:37.195 --> 00:25:40.885
It's coming from the mouth of David every single time.

428
00:25:41.765 --> 00:25:43.325
I think it's a major, major clue.

429
00:25:44.265 --> 00:25:47.885
The main point here is that David was close to God

430
00:25:49.665 --> 00:25:53.445
and he completely entrusted this situation to his God.

431
00:25:54.025 --> 00:25:56.405
He knew that Saul would die, he knew he would become king,

432
00:25:57.065 --> 00:25:59.205
but Saul was Yahweh's anointed

433
00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:02.325
and Yahweh was gonna take care of him.

434
00:26:02.945 --> 00:26:07.605
Not him, though he knew the end. He did not know the means.

435
00:26:09.255 --> 00:26:12.505
Look at verse 10. He says, Yahweh will strike him

436
00:26:12.525 --> 00:26:16.465
or his day will come to die or he will go down to battle

437
00:26:16.805 --> 00:26:17.865
and perish.

438
00:26:19.805 --> 00:26:22.665
For all David knew Saul could have died of old age.

439
00:26:23.785 --> 00:26:24.875
That was not his concern.

440
00:26:26.905 --> 00:26:30.405
He knew the means though did not involve abishai

441
00:26:30.995 --> 00:26:32.165
pinning him to the ground.

442
00:26:35.065 --> 00:26:37.325
But throughout world history, we know that many,

443
00:26:37.325 --> 00:26:40.565
many thrones have been taken by by bloodshed.

444
00:26:40.745 --> 00:26:43.165
It would not have been abnormal for David to take it here.

445
00:26:44.515 --> 00:26:48.375
In fact, it was abnormal for him not to take it here.

446
00:26:49.515 --> 00:26:53.215
In fact, Saul in their last encounter told him in in chapter

447
00:26:53.215 --> 00:26:56.095
24, verse 19, if a man finds his enemy,

448
00:26:56.095 --> 00:26:57.295
will he let him go away safe?

449
00:26:58.085 --> 00:27:00.375
That answer's no. It's not normal to do that.

450
00:27:01.475 --> 00:27:04.495
You see, it's normal to take matters into our own hands.

451
00:27:06.665 --> 00:27:07.895
Maybe you even believe

452
00:27:07.895 --> 00:27:10.735
that God is giving you the opportunity to do so.

453
00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:14.575
Have you ever heard the the statement,

454
00:27:14.595 --> 00:27:15.935
the end justifies the means?

455
00:27:16.245 --> 00:27:18.575
Ever heard that very common?

456
00:27:19.795 --> 00:27:21.335
Let me ask a question, is that true?

457
00:27:24.485 --> 00:27:29.115
Think about that for just a moment while I propose to you

458
00:27:29.115 --> 00:27:32.475
that it that is practically almost never true.

459
00:27:36.115 --> 00:27:38.255
As Christians, what we do matters,

460
00:27:39.235 --> 00:27:43.915
but how we do it also matters, right?

461
00:27:45.405 --> 00:27:48.355
Maybe it's lying on that resume to get that dream job.

462
00:27:49.055 --> 00:27:52.155
We file that under embellishing.

463
00:27:53.655 --> 00:27:57.195
But when does embellishing become an outright lie?

464
00:28:02.075 --> 00:28:06.055
And maybe it's throwing coworkers under the bus

465
00:28:06.675 --> 00:28:08.455
and lying

466
00:28:08.755 --> 00:28:10.455
and shameless self-promotion

467
00:28:10.475 --> 00:28:12.575
to get ahead in the corporate world, maybe to rise

468
00:28:12.595 --> 00:28:14.255
to the top of the corporate ladder.

469
00:28:16.875 --> 00:28:21.495
Or maybe it's lowering your

470
00:28:21.655 --> 00:28:26.055
standards and sacrificing your morals

471
00:28:26.315 --> 00:28:31.165
to find love, to speed up that process

472
00:28:31.305 --> 00:28:33.485
and find that potential future spouse

473
00:28:36.435 --> 00:28:39.975
rather than wait for God to work his plan out in our lives.

474
00:28:40.555 --> 00:28:42.975
We often want to take things into our own hands

475
00:28:42.995 --> 00:28:44.215
to speed that process up.

476
00:28:44.215 --> 00:28:47.015
Because you know, waiting on God is hard.

477
00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:49.975
Waiting on God is difficult. It's painful.

478
00:28:53.885 --> 00:28:57.145
And in the culture today around us, it's getting more

479
00:28:57.145 --> 00:29:01.125
and more difficult as we have this pressure, for instance,

480
00:29:01.605 --> 00:29:03.405
satisfaction, don't we?

481
00:29:04.425 --> 00:29:06.125
The end does not justify the means.

482
00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:09.045
And David knew that he was resolved

483
00:29:09.065 --> 00:29:11.405
to let Yahweh handle Yahweh's own matters.

484
00:29:11.905 --> 00:29:13.525
He would take care of Saul.

485
00:29:14.695 --> 00:29:17.005
David knew the end and the means were fuzzy,

486
00:29:17.945 --> 00:29:20.325
but he knew it would not come about

487
00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:22.325
by him sinning against his God.

488
00:29:23.815 --> 00:29:26.515
So in verse 12, we're gonna back up.

489
00:29:27.325 --> 00:29:31.035
We're gonna take Saul's spear and his water jug

490
00:29:31.135 --> 00:29:34.335
and we're gonna leave this encampment.

491
00:29:34.805 --> 00:29:36.415
Amazingly, nobody wakes up.

492
00:29:39.235 --> 00:29:42.485
They lie, still asleep.

493
00:29:43.835 --> 00:29:46.565
Imagine how that would've seemed to David

494
00:29:46.625 --> 00:29:51.405
and Abishai to know that God's sovereignty allowed for

495
00:29:51.945 --> 00:29:54.045
God to put them into a deep sleep

496
00:29:54.735 --> 00:29:56.485
while they got the spear and while they left.

497
00:29:57.545 --> 00:30:00.045
And in verse 13, it tells us that David

498
00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:02.485
and Abishai went far off to the top of a hill

499
00:30:03.075 --> 00:30:05.725
with a great space between them.

500
00:30:07.155 --> 00:30:09.485
This great space is a great physical space,

501
00:30:10.105 --> 00:30:13.445
but I'll propose to you that it is very symbolic of a great

502
00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:16.085
spiritual distance between them.

503
00:30:19.245 --> 00:30:21.025
If David is near to Yahweh

504
00:30:21.965 --> 00:30:24.825
and Saul is far from David,

505
00:30:25.275 --> 00:30:28.705
where do you think Saul is in his relation to God?

506
00:30:30.175 --> 00:30:32.755
Very far. Very far.

507
00:30:32.855 --> 00:30:34.475
And we've seen Saul moving farther

508
00:30:34.535 --> 00:30:37.155
and farther away over the last several

509
00:30:37.155 --> 00:30:38.355
chapters, have we not?

510
00:30:40.015 --> 00:30:43.235
So David calls over and Saul replies in verse 17.

511
00:30:43.735 --> 00:30:47.475
Is this your voice? My son David? Notice the familial term.

512
00:30:47.775 --> 00:30:52.395
My son David is having nothing to do with the fake proximity

513
00:30:52.505 --> 00:30:53.635
that Saul offers up.

514
00:30:54.215 --> 00:30:58.035
He simply replies my Lord o king.

515
00:30:58.685 --> 00:31:01.555
While Saul is far from God, there can be no commonality

516
00:31:01.555 --> 00:31:02.915
between David and Saul.

517
00:31:04.125 --> 00:31:07.555
After all, David's biggest complaint in Saul chasing him

518
00:31:08.175 --> 00:31:09.275
is in verse 19.

519
00:31:10.135 --> 00:31:13.075
He says, they have GI driven me out this day

520
00:31:13.075 --> 00:31:14.795
that I should have no share in the heritage

521
00:31:14.795 --> 00:31:17.475
of Yahweh saying go serve other gods.

522
00:31:17.815 --> 00:31:21.475
Did you catch that there are no other gods?

523
00:31:23.665 --> 00:31:27.655
David cared more about being driven from Yahweh's heritage

524
00:31:28.525 --> 00:31:30.015
than he did for his own life.

525
00:31:32.565 --> 00:31:34.705
He even writes in Psalm 63, 3,

526
00:31:34.705 --> 00:31:37.425
and I love the way the new Living translation puts it.

527
00:31:37.685 --> 00:31:40.745
He says, your unfailing love is better than life itself.

528
00:31:41.685 --> 00:31:42.785
How I praise you.

529
00:31:45.935 --> 00:31:47.705
Does that speak like your heart today?

530
00:31:48.535 --> 00:31:50.785
Does that thought resonate within your heart?

531
00:31:52.265 --> 00:31:55.315
That his unfailing love is more

532
00:31:55.335 --> 00:31:57.395
to you than your very life?

533
00:32:00.505 --> 00:32:04.195
Even in Saul's relentless pursuit of David's life,

534
00:32:04.195 --> 00:32:06.115
David rested near to God.

535
00:32:09.305 --> 00:32:11.365
So they depart

536
00:32:14.205 --> 00:32:16.175
Saul and David depart and they never meet again.

537
00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:20.215
In verse 25, Saul's last words

538
00:32:20.275 --> 00:32:24.455
to David are you will do many things and succeed in them.

539
00:32:25.555 --> 00:32:29.175
As the chapter closes, Yahweh continues to be on the heart

540
00:32:29.195 --> 00:32:31.575
and the mind and the lips of David.

541
00:32:32.225 --> 00:32:35.695
While Saul's over here getting his wisdom from fortune

542
00:32:35.815 --> 00:32:40.765
cookies, He never

543
00:32:40.765 --> 00:32:45.145
even mentions the name of God once in this chapter.

544
00:32:46.085 --> 00:32:47.225
So where is Saul?

545
00:32:48.435 --> 00:32:52.045
Where is David and where are you?

546
00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:58.855
Well, how can we tell? Remember our last two

547
00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:00.975
verses in Psalm 54 verses six

548
00:33:00.975 --> 00:33:03.775
and seven, directing his gaze to Yahweh

549
00:33:03.775 --> 00:33:06.375
with a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you.

550
00:33:07.015 --> 00:33:10.255
I will give thanks to your name. Oh, Yahweh for it is good.

551
00:33:11.355 --> 00:33:14.295
Why? For he has delivered me from every trouble

552
00:33:14.795 --> 00:33:18.975
and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.

553
00:33:19.075 --> 00:33:20.375
How did he get to that point?

554
00:33:20.915 --> 00:33:22.655
He didn't know how it would go down,

555
00:33:25.495 --> 00:33:27.515
but he was so sure of God's will.

556
00:33:27.695 --> 00:33:29.595
And isn't that the question we often ask?

557
00:33:29.655 --> 00:33:33.685
How do I know God's will? How do I know God's will?

558
00:33:34.115 --> 00:33:35.165
Well, I would submit to you

559
00:33:36.675 --> 00:33:39.205
that first step is knowing God.

560
00:33:40.835 --> 00:33:43.165
Knowing God. Maybe you're here today

561
00:33:43.865 --> 00:33:45.925
and you didn't even know that God was knowable

562
00:33:48.255 --> 00:33:51.675
or that he's a near God who wants

563
00:33:51.675 --> 00:33:53.555
to have personal relationships with people.

564
00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:56.955
Well, I'll tell you some good news.

565
00:33:57.335 --> 00:34:00.355
He is knowable and having a relationship

566
00:34:00.355 --> 00:34:01.635
with him is possible,

567
00:34:01.635 --> 00:34:04.195
but not on our own means it's only

568
00:34:04.195 --> 00:34:05.755
through his son Jesus Christ.

569
00:34:07.555 --> 00:34:10.255
You see, it's our sin which puts immeasurable distance

570
00:34:10.255 --> 00:34:12.775
between us so that we cannot come to him.

571
00:34:14.355 --> 00:34:16.335
But he provided that way for us.

572
00:34:16.675 --> 00:34:21.615
He came to us, his son, Jesus came and took our sin

573
00:34:21.635 --> 00:34:25.575
and took that death penalty that we deserved in our place.

574
00:34:25.675 --> 00:34:28.495
So that by faith, by trusting, believing in him,

575
00:34:29.355 --> 00:34:32.335
we can have eternal life and we can truly know him.

576
00:34:34.805 --> 00:34:37.665
But for the believers who are here today,

577
00:34:39.125 --> 00:34:43.745
we are then able also to draw closer to him and move nearer

578
00:34:43.805 --> 00:34:45.385
and nearer to him as well.

579
00:34:45.805 --> 00:34:48.545
Now, there's two biblical words which I want to share

580
00:34:48.545 --> 00:34:49.665
with you that get the point across.

581
00:34:49.665 --> 00:34:53.665
They're not in our text, but conceptually they talk about

582
00:34:53.665 --> 00:34:55.785
how we can know God in in different ways.

583
00:34:55.925 --> 00:34:58.905
The first is the Greek word oda.

584
00:34:59.945 --> 00:35:01.145
OIDA.

585
00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:05.875
Oda speaks to a perceived or deduced

586
00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:07.915
or a reasoned knowledge.

587
00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:11.755
It's intellectual, perceived deduced

588
00:35:12.515 --> 00:35:13.795
reasoned knowledge.

589
00:35:14.675 --> 00:35:18.065
Remember Abishai, he knew Elohim,

590
00:35:20.355 --> 00:35:22.335
he knew God, he knew David would be king,

591
00:35:22.335 --> 00:35:23.335
and Saul had to die.

592
00:35:23.835 --> 00:35:25.455
So in a sense he knew God's will.

593
00:35:26.115 --> 00:35:30.095
But from a distance to abishai, we could say that God

594
00:35:31.035 --> 00:35:32.215
was the man upstairs.

595
00:35:32.645 --> 00:35:36.585
Have you ever heard that? The man upstairs.

596
00:35:36.695 --> 00:35:37.725
Have you ever said that?

597
00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:44.385
I would propose to you that as Christians we ought not

598
00:35:44.445 --> 00:35:46.785
to say that about God,

599
00:35:46.805 --> 00:35:49.025
but we should never, ever, ever think

600
00:35:49.025 --> 00:35:53.055
that for two reasons.

601
00:35:53.465 --> 00:35:56.095
First of all, the Bible doesn't portray him that way.

602
00:35:56.155 --> 00:36:01.015
He portrays, they portray God as near and present

603
00:36:01.195 --> 00:36:04.175
and active in our lives and in the world around us.

604
00:36:04.915 --> 00:36:07.695
But the second reason is established very early in the

605
00:36:07.775 --> 00:36:10.695
scripture in Genesis four, seven B.

606
00:36:11.595 --> 00:36:13.935
It says this, sin is crouching at the door

607
00:36:13.935 --> 00:36:17.855
and this desire is for you, but you must master it.

608
00:36:18.475 --> 00:36:21.455
That's the danger in placing distance between us and God.

609
00:36:22.915 --> 00:36:25.295
Are you living your life today? Like he's the man upstairs.

610
00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:31.255
Is he distant? Do we go to him when we need something

611
00:36:31.255 --> 00:36:32.335
or when we're in a bind?

612
00:36:34.245 --> 00:36:36.895
That just isn't the way God is portrayed in the Bible

613
00:36:37.835 --> 00:36:40.175
and the invitation is to draw near to him

614
00:36:40.235 --> 00:36:41.935
and know him better.

615
00:36:42.195 --> 00:36:43.775
And that leads us to the second word.

616
00:36:44.125 --> 00:36:48.335
That second word is the Greek word gco. Gco.

617
00:36:50.395 --> 00:36:52.045
It's an experienced knowledge.

618
00:36:52.045 --> 00:36:55.365
It's an experiential knowledge.

619
00:36:56.825 --> 00:36:59.685
It speaks of one who is close to God's heart.

620
00:37:00.845 --> 00:37:02.435
David had that intimate knowledge

621
00:37:02.435 --> 00:37:04.635
of God in Psalm 25, 4 and five.

622
00:37:04.735 --> 00:37:07.075
He writes, make me know your way.

623
00:37:07.175 --> 00:37:09.195
So Yahweh, teach me your path.

624
00:37:09.905 --> 00:37:12.315
Lead me in your truth and teach me for you

625
00:37:12.315 --> 00:37:14.915
or the God of my salvation for you.

626
00:37:15.035 --> 00:37:19.115
I wait all the day long. Make me know your ways.

627
00:37:19.215 --> 00:37:21.555
That's that same. It's the Hebrew equivalent

628
00:37:21.555 --> 00:37:22.955
to the word ginosko.

629
00:37:23.735 --> 00:37:25.355
And later Solomon,

630
00:37:25.355 --> 00:37:27.755
his son would famously write in Proverbs three, six,

631
00:37:28.335 --> 00:37:32.845
in all your ways, acknowledge him.

632
00:37:32.845 --> 00:37:36.245
That's that same word in all your ways. Know him.

633
00:37:37.775 --> 00:37:40.905
Know him, KNOW, him

634
00:37:41.245 --> 00:37:43.265
and he will make straight your paths.

635
00:37:43.885 --> 00:37:47.505
The making straight of your paths is God's will

636
00:37:49.185 --> 00:37:50.705
revealed to you in your life.

637
00:37:52.885 --> 00:37:57.105
So those paths,

638
00:37:57.375 --> 00:38:01.265
they may not be easy, they may not be glamorous,

639
00:38:02.335 --> 00:38:03.705
they may not even be obvious.

640
00:38:05.245 --> 00:38:06.265
So church, we wait.

641
00:38:07.695 --> 00:38:10.875
We wait like David all the day long and maybe the day

642
00:38:11.115 --> 00:38:13.315
after that and maybe the day after that.

643
00:38:14.695 --> 00:38:19.355
But when we know him, as David knew him, we're near to him

644
00:38:20.535 --> 00:38:21.875
as he was near to him,

645
00:38:22.335 --> 00:38:26.835
and we can experience as we encounter God, we can experience

646
00:38:28.765 --> 00:38:30.495
that he is sufficient

647
00:38:30.755 --> 00:38:34.175
and he is satisfying in that waiting.

648
00:38:34.595 --> 00:38:37.445
And we can, like David offer up the free will offering

649
00:38:37.465 --> 00:38:39.755
of our life to him

650
00:38:41.055 --> 00:38:43.875
and give thanks to him knowing that he is good.

651
00:38:46.175 --> 00:38:49.195
Is that the way you know God?

652
00:38:52.395 --> 00:38:56.455
Is that the way you know God? Where are you today? Church?

653
00:38:56.795 --> 00:38:57.015
Yes.
