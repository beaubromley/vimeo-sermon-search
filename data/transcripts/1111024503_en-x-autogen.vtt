1
00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:19.895
Amen.

2
00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:22.495
Amen. All right, you can be seated this morning.

3
00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:25.375
It is a beautiful day. It's great to see you.

4
00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:28.735
Uh, it's a beautiful day for many reasons actually.

5
00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:30.895
We have a great weather, of course,

6
00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.535
but it's also promotion Sunday.

7
00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:35.055
That's what we call it around here when

8
00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:36.095
everybody moves up a grade.

9
00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:38.295
And so that means a couple things.

10
00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:41.775
First, it means that there are kindergartners in the

11
00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.935
room for the first time.

12
00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:45.455
And so kindergartners, if you're here, let's just hear it.

13
00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:48.015
Can you hear it? Kid? Kids, kids, kindergartners, anybody?

14
00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:51.575
Are you all kindergartners? I, I said kindergartners.

15
00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:54.375
Can I hear you? Anyway? Okay. Um, okay.

16
00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:56.015
Some of you're like, man, I don't want to go back.

17
00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.855
I love nap time. Alright, so, uh, we are gonna be

18
00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:00.575
worshiping together.

19
00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:02.335
We got new faces in the room.

20
00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:04.615
And so that means just invite those around you.

21
00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:06.655
Kindergarters, I know you're able to engage.

22
00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:08.975
I've seen you do it. I'm excited to have you in here

23
00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:10.175
with us every Sunday.

24
00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:12.375
Uh, but also greet those around you.

25
00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:14.775
Welcome each other as you see each other today.

26
00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:17.895
Uh, there are a lot of new faces today and next week,

27
00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:19.575
but it's also a great day

28
00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:23.175
because what we're gonna do today is celebrate calling it

29
00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:24.615
Celebration Sunday in a way

30
00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:28.975
where we are utilizing our worship gathering to celebrate

31
00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:31.895
specifically what God has done this summer.

32
00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:36.255
And many of you don't get to see what all happens

33
00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:38.575
through the ministries of our church.

34
00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:40.455
You don't get to be at camp with us

35
00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:42.735
or do things, uh, during the weeks.

36
00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:45.055
You don't get to see it. Like some of us on staff get

37
00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:46.175
to see a, a lot of that.

38
00:01:46.235 --> 00:01:49.575
And so we wanna share just part of it with you, uh,

39
00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:50.855
because it's, it's a meaningful thing.

40
00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:54.375
Now, why would we do this? Why would we celebrate like this?

41
00:01:55.435 --> 00:01:56.895
Why is celebrating important?

42
00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:00.175
Well, here's what Psalm 77 11 says.

43
00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:02.455
I will remember the deeds of the Lord.

44
00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:06.295
Yes, I will remember your wonders of old.

45
00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:11.675
And so we too need to be reminded of what God has done.

46
00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:15.995
These wonders of old, what he's accomplished in us,

47
00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:17.915
what he's accomplished through us.

48
00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:20.635
Because then what that leads us to is

49
00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:22.075
what we did when we came in here.

50
00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:26.355
Psalm 100 verse four, enter his gates with Thanksgiving,

51
00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:28.795
his courts with praise.

52
00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:32.435
Give thanks to him and bless his name.

53
00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:37.435
Like that's a command in Psalm 100 for us to do that

54
00:02:38.415 --> 00:02:41.555
as we come into his presence, which we know we always are.

55
00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:45.315
But in a way, this today uniquely as we gather like this is

56
00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:46.395
that as well.

57
00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:48.995
And so we do that because God's commanded it.

58
00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:50.435
It's important for us.

59
00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:54.515
But we also do this because God has, has baked celebration

60
00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:56.595
into our very faith.

61
00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:00.565
Like this is just part of what it means to be a Christian.

62
00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:02.565
Think about the Old Testament.

63
00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.365
God commanded feasts

64
00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:07.885
and festivals for his people to celebrate.

65
00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:11.135
And those weren't just parties that they got

66
00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:13.295
to have great meals and time together.

67
00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:18.055
Those were sacred remembrances that God ordained

68
00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:21.455
for his people to participate in The Feast of the Harvest,

69
00:03:21.595 --> 00:03:23.695
the Feast of Booths, the Passover,

70
00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:26.495
there's many others you can go find in the Old Testament.

71
00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:29.375
But each of those was, was a divine appointment

72
00:03:29.755 --> 00:03:32.695
for God's people to stop, to remember,

73
00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:35.055
and to celebrate God's faithfulness.

74
00:03:37.285 --> 00:03:39.835
Think about the, the New Testament, the Lord's Supper

75
00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:41.595
that we celebrate regularly here.

76
00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:44.195
That is a reminder.

77
00:03:44.415 --> 00:03:46.915
God instituted a celebration

78
00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:50.675
to remind us of what Jesus has done.

79
00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:53.315
Jesus literally said, remember Right.

80
00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:58.235
And so these acts that God has put into our faith means

81
00:03:58.865 --> 00:04:01.915
celebration is not optional for Christians.

82
00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:06.275
These are commanded things for us.

83
00:04:06.785 --> 00:04:09.955
Celebration is commanded. Just listen to Psalm 78.

84
00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:11.155
This is verses four

85
00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:14.435
and seven says, we will not hide them from their children,

86
00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:18.315
but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds

87
00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:19.835
of the Lord and his might

88
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:22.515
and the wonders that he has done so

89
00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:24.955
that they should set their hope in God

90
00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:28.875
and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments.

91
00:04:30.995 --> 00:04:33.135
See, when we celebrate what God has done,

92
00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:36.335
we're not just being grateful, as good as that is, as right

93
00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:39.135
as that is, we're declaring his character

94
00:04:39.635 --> 00:04:41.135
and we're strengthening our faith.

95
00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:43.135
We are encouraging one another

96
00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:45.655
and we're turning around to the next generations

97
00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:50.415
and saying, here's who our God is passing the faith on

98
00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:52.655
to those behind us.

99
00:04:54.035 --> 00:04:55.895
And so that's part of why we celebrate.

100
00:04:57.665 --> 00:04:59.395
There's one more celebration,

101
00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:01.155
also builds our spiritual memory.

102
00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:05.285
It builds our spiritual memory. Israel had feasts.

103
00:05:05.285 --> 00:05:06.285
Israel had festivals,

104
00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:09.445
but God also commanded them throughout the Old Testament

105
00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:11.845
to build altars in the wilderness

106
00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:17.445
at times throughout history as markers of his faithfulness.

107
00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:23.905
And so every time Israel families, individuals would walk by

108
00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:27.105
that pile of rocks in the wilderness, they would remember

109
00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:29.265
that God was faithful here.

110
00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:33.505
He will surely be faithful again. It was a reminder.

111
00:05:33.885 --> 00:05:35.665
God was faithful. Look what he did here.

112
00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:37.465
Remember how he walked us

113
00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:40.185
through on dry land in the middle of the ocean, right?

114
00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:43.705
He was faithful Here he'll surely be faithful again.

115
00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:47.165
That's spiritual memories.

116
00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:50.085
Celebrations do similar things for us even today.

117
00:05:51.955 --> 00:05:53.015
So that's why we're doing this.

118
00:05:53.825 --> 00:05:55.615
We're gratefully celebrating God

119
00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:58.325
and we're asking him, do it again.

120
00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:01.605
Do it again. God, we can't control that.

121
00:06:01.605 --> 00:06:04.005
We don't manipulate him, but we're asking him in

122
00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:05.285
faith, God we know you.

123
00:06:05.285 --> 00:06:09.405
Can you have, please do it again. Do more again.

124
00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:12.165
And so we're gonna sing, we're gonna have stories,

125
00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:14.005
we're gonna hear testimonies, all of

126
00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:15.405
that today throughout this.

127
00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:18.925
But let's stand first and let's sing those truths of

128
00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:20.525
what he's done before we hear some stories.

129
00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:22.405
Let's sing together what he's done.

130
00:06:48.485 --> 00:06:49.705
Um, hi, my name is Cooper.

131
00:06:50.085 --> 00:06:54.465
Um, this summer I got to attend both student camp

132
00:06:54.645 --> 00:06:57.545
and, um, super summer and both were really great events.

133
00:06:57.685 --> 00:07:00.985
But um, at super summer there's just this deeper

134
00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:02.345
level of discussion.

135
00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:05.225
Um, and there's something about being around a group

136
00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:06.545
of people that you've never met

137
00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:08.745
before, um, that you just get this picture

138
00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:13.825
of heaven in my mind of being around hundreds of kids

139
00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:16.505
and teenagers worshiping at the top of their lungs.

140
00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:19.385
Getting To experience, seeing God move

141
00:07:19.385 --> 00:07:21.705
through teens your age, um,

142
00:07:21.735 --> 00:07:24.065
that live in your state is super encouraging.

143
00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:27.185
Uh, especially when you know you're with people you do know

144
00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:29.505
and building relationships with people you don't know.

145
00:07:29.965 --> 00:07:32.865
Um, it's just a really encouraging feeling to get to be

146
00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:34.385
around believers like that for a week.

147
00:07:34.435 --> 00:07:36.425
Super summer and Kingdom of the Beach were definitely

148
00:07:36.425 --> 00:07:37.425
highlights of my summer.

149
00:07:41.665 --> 00:07:43.745
I think the most impactful, uh,

150
00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:45.625
event this summer has been kids camp for me.

151
00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.105
Uh, getting to use my gifts and serve on the worship team

152
00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:50.705
and, uh, grow a relationship

153
00:07:50.705 --> 00:07:52.465
with other kids in my free time and during rec.

154
00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:53.705
'cause it's just been really special.

155
00:07:54.305 --> 00:07:57.385
I went to A lot of the camps this summer

156
00:07:57.925 --> 00:07:59.785
and I thought it was really cool just to see

157
00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:03.425
how like at kids camp, the kids responding to the teachings

158
00:08:03.445 --> 00:08:06.465
and just seeing them actively start to love one another.

159
00:08:06.895 --> 00:08:10.465
There's something so special about looking out

160
00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:13.705
as you're worshiping at a couple hundred kids,

161
00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:17.465
praising the Lord with you, um, really speaks to

162
00:08:17.465 --> 00:08:18.745
what childlike faith is.

163
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.105
Um, and I think that spoke to my heart, um,

164
00:08:22.165 --> 00:08:26.305
and how that God can use people

165
00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:29.385
of all ages to praise him and to glorify him.

166
00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:32.865
I think our church this summer has grown a lot both in the

167
00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:34.225
student ministry and as a whole.

168
00:08:34.485 --> 00:08:36.065
Um, our reflection

169
00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:39.705
and meditation on Romans 1212, um, I've seen a lot

170
00:08:39.705 --> 00:08:41.505
of growth, especially in our student ministry,

171
00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.585
just us coming together in prayer

172
00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:45.145
and then as a church as a whole.

173
00:08:45.565 --> 00:08:48.105
Um, I feel like our connectivity has been growing

174
00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:50.345
and ever increasing, both in the student ministry

175
00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:51.465
and in the adult ministries.

176
00:08:52.485 --> 00:08:54.865
Uh, seeing our church take up opportunities

177
00:08:55.025 --> 00:08:57.045
to serve in state, out of state

178
00:08:57.065 --> 00:08:59.565
and even out of the country is super encouraging,

179
00:08:59.565 --> 00:09:03.805
especially giving, um, people my age opportunity and adults

180
00:09:03.905 --> 00:09:05.525
and families the opportunity to do that.

181
00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:07.525
Uh, it's super, it's just super

182
00:09:07.525 --> 00:09:08.765
heartwarming to see all that happen.

183
00:09:09.385 --> 00:09:12.805
For me personally, the Lord has really been showing me how

184
00:09:13.825 --> 00:09:16.885
he can work through even the loneliest times.

185
00:09:17.305 --> 00:09:20.925
One of the hardest things to go through at this age is just

186
00:09:21.835 --> 00:09:24.885
feeling like you're alone.

187
00:09:25.295 --> 00:09:27.525
Which what God has taught me this summer is

188
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:30.165
that you're like, you're not 'cause He's with you.

189
00:09:30.705 --> 00:09:33.325
Um, and I really, I've been convicted this summer

190
00:09:33.465 --> 00:09:35.125
of just longing for a person,

191
00:09:35.505 --> 00:09:38.565
but knowing that the Lord is the one I need

192
00:09:39.105 --> 00:09:40.105
God. This summer at

193
00:09:40.105 --> 00:09:41.765
the beginning I prayed for God

194
00:09:41.785 --> 00:09:43.965
to just give me, uh, his wisdom

195
00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:45.965
and direct me down his path for me

196
00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:48.685
and to give me godly friends to help me do that.

197
00:09:48.825 --> 00:09:50.845
And he's brought me closer to people this summer

198
00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:52.805
that I never thought I'd be close with.

199
00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:55.965
And they have absolutely changed my life.

200
00:09:56.265 --> 00:09:58.125
Um, even in just these three months,

201
00:09:58.635 --> 00:10:00.085
they've held me accountable

202
00:10:00.145 --> 00:10:01.965
and they've been there for me every step of the way.

203
00:10:01.965 --> 00:10:03.645
And that's exactly what I needed this summer.

204
00:10:03.945 --> 00:10:05.325
Um, this year at student camp, we walked

205
00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:06.325
through the Psalms of Ascent

206
00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:08.605
and it was just kind of God reminding me that,

207
00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:10.205
um, he is in control.

208
00:10:10.265 --> 00:10:13.365
Psalms 1 27, 1 through two talks about, um,

209
00:10:13.465 --> 00:10:15.205
if he's not the one building the house,

210
00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:16.565
you will labor in vain.

211
00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:18.765
I feel like God's been working in my heart

212
00:10:18.765 --> 00:10:20.325
to grow my relationship closer with him

213
00:10:20.425 --> 00:10:23.045
and, uh, seek out strong fellowship with other men

214
00:10:23.065 --> 00:10:25.005
to walk their life together. God

215
00:10:25.105 --> 00:10:28.045
Has really been challenging me to, instead

216
00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:31.645
of just being filled up to pour out into the other students

217
00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:34.805
and the younger classmen, um, and just the people around me.

218
00:10:38.775 --> 00:10:40.805
Isn't that pretty amazing church? Yeah.

219
00:10:44.585 --> 00:10:45.605
Got more stories to come,

220
00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:50.085
but just, just a glimpse of what God has done, uh,

221
00:10:50.085 --> 00:10:51.885
especially in our student ministry this summer,

222
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.485
but he's been writing his story

223
00:10:53.485 --> 00:10:56.325
of faithfulness across our lives, across our church.

224
00:10:56.635 --> 00:10:58.525
It's been amazing to watch.

225
00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:03.165
I just think back to how I've seen God be faithful to many

226
00:11:03.165 --> 00:11:07.165
of you through some really difficult seasons this summer.

227
00:11:07.705 --> 00:11:10.405
Uh, I, I know of financial strain

228
00:11:10.405 --> 00:11:14.085
that you've seen God provide in miraculous ways.

229
00:11:14.525 --> 00:11:18.045
I think of broken relationships, how God has sustained you

230
00:11:18.045 --> 00:11:19.085
through in the midst of that.

231
00:11:19.205 --> 00:11:23.285
I can see dark seasons emotionally that God has brought you

232
00:11:23.325 --> 00:11:25.605
through and, and you're still walking maybe in the darkness,

233
00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:27.245
but you see a glimmer of light

234
00:11:27.475 --> 00:11:29.325
because of what he's done in your life.

235
00:11:30.585 --> 00:11:33.005
Uh, we've also watched faithful men

236
00:11:33.005 --> 00:11:34.885
and women who've lived long, full

237
00:11:35.815 --> 00:11:39.125
lives finally finish their race and see Jesus face to face.

238
00:11:40.145 --> 00:11:42.245
Uh, it seems like this summer has been a lot of those,

239
00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:44.965
and it's a beautiful grief.

240
00:11:46.075 --> 00:11:49.925
There's a hope mixed together with the grief through loss,

241
00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:53.445
but then to watch God work in

242
00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:57.685
and through those who are remaining here grieving the loss,

243
00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:00.485
for example, here's an encouraging story.

244
00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:04.245
Uh, this lifted my soul so much just a couple days ago.

245
00:12:04.905 --> 00:12:08.605
One of our senior saints lost his wife of 69 years

246
00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:13.125
and he cared for her so well through the last few stages

247
00:12:13.145 --> 00:12:14.285
of her life especially,

248
00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:17.925
but all of her life, well, yesterday he was talking to one

249
00:12:17.925 --> 00:12:19.645
of our staff members and he said, Hey Brad,

250
00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:20.845
are you going to church tomorrow?

251
00:12:21.585 --> 00:12:23.885
And Brad said, yes, of course I'm going to church.

252
00:12:24.065 --> 00:12:28.125
And he says, me too, because I've gotta go

253
00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:32.405
and thank God 100 times for how good he's been

254
00:12:32.425 --> 00:12:33.725
to me and my sweet wife.

255
00:12:35.235 --> 00:12:37.605
Like that's, that's only the Lord doing

256
00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:38.765
that in a life, right?

257
00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:41.805
Like that's the kind of stuff that we see God do

258
00:12:42.675 --> 00:12:46.205
even quietly behind the scenes in places like that.

259
00:12:47.925 --> 00:12:50.245
I, I look back as well, Cooper mentioned it in the video,

260
00:12:50.385 --> 00:12:54.005
but I look back to this summer, the power of God's word.

261
00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:58.485
As we walk through Romans 12, and God was realigning us back

262
00:12:58.545 --> 00:13:01.685
and still is realigning us to Christ's perfect image,

263
00:13:02.625 --> 00:13:04.245
how he worked through his word.

264
00:13:04.335 --> 00:13:07.245
We've seen many new faces join our church family

265
00:13:07.385 --> 00:13:08.445
in the last few months.

266
00:13:09.315 --> 00:13:14.095
People who are seeking questioning, searching, longing for

267
00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:19.315
healing as found only in the gospel of Jesus Christ

268
00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:21.075
and the people committed to him.

269
00:13:23.185 --> 00:13:25.635
Kids camp a few weeks ago has been mentioned.

270
00:13:26.215 --> 00:13:28.315
We had five children share with some

271
00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:30.755
of those leaders on the video that God was drawing them

272
00:13:30.775 --> 00:13:33.795
to faith in the Lord as their savior

273
00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:36.715
and as their king five children.

274
00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:39.995
And then at the same camp, I, I sat around a table

275
00:13:40.065 --> 00:13:43.275
with a group of third grade girls as they asked

276
00:13:44.255 --> 00:13:49.115
and answered deep theological questions that they wanted

277
00:13:49.115 --> 00:13:51.955
to know and understand our God, third grade girls.

278
00:13:52.015 --> 00:13:53.555
And, and one girl asked a question

279
00:13:53.575 --> 00:13:55.315
and this other girl answered it.

280
00:13:55.415 --> 00:13:56.515
And then they looked to me

281
00:13:56.515 --> 00:13:58.195
and I was like, that's how I would've answered it.

282
00:13:58.455 --> 00:14:00.315
And that was great. And they were encouraging

283
00:14:00.315 --> 00:14:04.995
to each other in that just this past Sunday we had a,

284
00:14:05.035 --> 00:14:08.155
a young man come up after the service and,

285
00:14:08.455 --> 00:14:12.395
and he was being prayed for by friends and family.

286
00:14:13.175 --> 00:14:16.155
And in that moment, God led him to be born again

287
00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:17.675
through the gospel of Jesus Christ,

288
00:14:17.675 --> 00:14:18.755
right up here after the service.

289
00:14:20.255 --> 00:14:24.555
Uh, we've seen so many this summer inviting friends

290
00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:26.995
and family to gather with us for worship

291
00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:29.035
because they're so excited.

292
00:14:29.095 --> 00:14:32.275
You, you are so excited for what God is doing in your life

293
00:14:32.275 --> 00:14:34.235
that you can't help but share it with people who are

294
00:14:34.235 --> 00:14:35.915
around you and say, Hey, come

295
00:14:35.915 --> 00:14:37.715
and see what God has done

296
00:14:39.465 --> 00:14:41.515
then just watch our students worship

297
00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:46.465
like there is a passion, their hunger for God's wor.

298
00:14:46.465 --> 00:14:48.625
It's not just this emotional sense of like, Hey,

299
00:14:48.665 --> 00:14:50.145
I love being in this environment.

300
00:14:50.145 --> 00:14:52.725
There's an emotional depth of hunger

301
00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:56.325
for God's word happening amongst our student ministry.

302
00:14:57.265 --> 00:14:59.445
And so guys, listen, I know most of you're sitting here,

303
00:14:59.445 --> 00:15:00.565
some over there, but I'm proud of you.

304
00:15:00.805 --> 00:15:02.405
I really am. It's exciting to watch

305
00:15:02.545 --> 00:15:04.445
and I'm super excited to see how he grows

306
00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:06.525
that fueling the passion for us.

307
00:15:06.525 --> 00:15:08.325
But it's not just them. I've said this

308
00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:09.445
before many, many times

309
00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:14.165
to hear you sing church that's growing.

310
00:15:14.785 --> 00:15:17.365
It shows we've been talking about treasuring Christ the last

311
00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:19.005
few months as a church.

312
00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:22.565
There's an evidence that it's happening as we just say,

313
00:15:22.565 --> 00:15:23.605
Jesus, you're worth it.

314
00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:27.205
And I'm shouting your praise in song.

315
00:15:28.725 --> 00:15:30.465
And we could go on and on like everybody,

316
00:15:30.465 --> 00:15:32.665
we could have a parade of people just coming up here

317
00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:33.665
and saying, here's what God did.

318
00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:35.425
Here's what God did. We could do that.

319
00:15:36.045 --> 00:15:40.065
But as great as all that is, let's not get the wrong idea.

320
00:15:41.885 --> 00:15:44.785
We don't celebrate all this because we're lucky

321
00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:50.825
because we worked really hard this summer or

322
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.345
because we have a great staff team and a lot of resources.

323
00:15:53.365 --> 00:15:54.865
And look what we can produce.

324
00:15:58.395 --> 00:16:01.305
We've seen what we've seen this summer

325
00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:06.535
as evidence of a God who's always working, always loving,

326
00:16:06.915 --> 00:16:08.815
always faithful, always good.

327
00:16:10.485 --> 00:16:12.225
All the things that we talk about today,

328
00:16:12.225 --> 00:16:14.825
everything we've said so far, he is always in that.

329
00:16:14.825 --> 00:16:18.265
And if you ever doubt that, all you have to do is look back

330
00:16:18.265 --> 00:16:19.705
to the cross of Jesus Christ.

331
00:16:21.115 --> 00:16:23.255
If it looks like there's not much you can celebrate,

332
00:16:23.285 --> 00:16:25.855
just keep looking back to the gospel

333
00:16:26.205 --> 00:16:28.895
because that's the ultimate display of his love,

334
00:16:30.515 --> 00:16:34.335
the sacrifice of his son to redeem us from sin so

335
00:16:34.335 --> 00:16:35.735
that we could live in the freedom

336
00:16:35.915 --> 00:16:38.295
of his presence both here and forever.

337
00:16:40.445 --> 00:16:42.785
All because he loved his enemies like you and me.

338
00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:47.485
And so if we're looking for it, there is

339
00:16:47.545 --> 00:16:50.205
so much in our lives that we can celebrate God with.

340
00:16:50.755 --> 00:16:53.245
There's so much we can give thanks for.

341
00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:54.405
There's so much what we can say.

342
00:16:54.425 --> 00:16:56.765
The psalmist in Psalm 1 26, verse three,

343
00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.765
the Lord has done great things for us

344
00:17:00.225 --> 00:17:04.605
and we are glad, but I don't have much.

345
00:17:04.745 --> 00:17:08.485
No, you've got the cross. You've got what God did in that.

346
00:17:08.555 --> 00:17:11.725
There's so much more if we really look through God's lenses,

347
00:17:12.015 --> 00:17:15.885
let's not be ashamed to give him praise

348
00:17:16.345 --> 00:17:18.005
for the things that we see.

349
00:17:18.265 --> 00:17:20.285
We recognize his hand in our lives.

350
00:17:20.495 --> 00:17:23.285
Let's give him praise for that.

351
00:17:29.295 --> 00:17:33.345
Amen. Well, in the

352
00:17:33.885 --> 00:17:35.745
second service today, uh,

353
00:17:35.845 --> 00:17:37.905
at this point in the service, we have a baptism.

354
00:17:38.405 --> 00:17:41.945
We, a young man, 19-year-old who, uh, came to faith

355
00:17:42.005 --> 00:17:45.785
and just wanted to express that to the church today.

356
00:17:45.785 --> 00:17:47.865
And so you can be praying for Dennis

357
00:17:48.285 --> 00:17:49.765
as he gets baptized later.

358
00:17:50.425 --> 00:17:52.405
Uh, but I, I just wanna pray for him and I

359
00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.405
and I I think it's time

360
00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:58.045
and appropriate to play, pray for all of our students,

361
00:17:58.555 --> 00:18:02.045
kids, teachers, administrators, started school now and,

362
00:18:02.045 --> 00:18:05.125
and just to see God work in major ways

363
00:18:05.315 --> 00:18:07.285
through them this year.

364
00:18:07.465 --> 00:18:09.605
And so let's pray together towards that end.

365
00:18:10.545 --> 00:18:14.645
God, thank you for Dennis coming to be baptized today.

366
00:18:14.865 --> 00:18:16.845
And we pray that you would encourage him and

367
00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:19.965
and spur on his faith as he continues to follow you.

368
00:18:21.545 --> 00:18:23.005
But in light of that, and in light of

369
00:18:23.005 --> 00:18:25.725
what you've done this summer, we do pray God, that this

370
00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:29.605
next year, especially the schools

371
00:18:30.745 --> 00:18:34.365
or that you would fill with your spirit, your people to go

372
00:18:34.935 --> 00:18:37.965
shine light in a dark place, to witness to

373
00:18:39.425 --> 00:18:44.105
the wonders of God, the glory of the gospel, the goodness

374
00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:48.545
of our savior, God, may you do a mighty work.

375
00:18:48.685 --> 00:18:52.385
May it be something that only you can take the credit for,

376
00:18:52.385 --> 00:18:53.865
that we all look back

377
00:18:53.885 --> 00:18:57.305
and are stunned by to watch you do what you do this year.

378
00:18:58.475 --> 00:18:59.985
Thank you God for what you have done.

379
00:18:59.985 --> 00:19:03.025
And we pray for more, not for our own selfish reasons,

380
00:19:03.085 --> 00:19:04.745
but for more glory for you.

381
00:19:05.525 --> 00:19:07.665
In Jesus' name. Amen.

382
00:19:10.095 --> 00:19:12.265
Well, as we celebrate what God has done,

383
00:19:13.565 --> 00:19:17.025
we also prepare our hearts for what we believe he will do

384
00:19:17.975 --> 00:19:21.345
that he goes, we go forward into God's purposes.

385
00:19:21.525 --> 00:19:23.465
The same God who's been faithful this summer,

386
00:19:23.845 --> 00:19:27.225
we believe will be faithful in seasons ahead.

387
00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:32.465
This is not today just a a sentimental look backward.

388
00:19:33.775 --> 00:19:37.825
This is a faith building launch forward.

389
00:19:40.005 --> 00:19:42.255
When I think about transformative faith, I can't help

390
00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:45.895
but think of Peter in Matthew chapter 14.

391
00:19:47.075 --> 00:19:49.975
So the scene is where Jesus was walking on the water

392
00:19:50.715 --> 00:19:52.375
and all the disciples are in the boat

393
00:19:52.395 --> 00:19:54.495
and they're watching him do this and they're stunned

394
00:19:54.495 --> 00:19:55.775
and they're amazed and all of those things.

395
00:19:55.915 --> 00:20:00.295
Of course, yet, listen to what Peter said,

396
00:20:01.935 --> 00:20:03.785
Matthew 1428.

397
00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.855
And Peter answered him, Lord, if it is you

398
00:20:10.325 --> 00:20:12.975
command me to come to you on the water.

399
00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:16.535
Now we kind of skate right over that.

400
00:20:17.155 --> 00:20:19.055
But that's faith, isn't it?

401
00:20:23.145 --> 00:20:24.805
That's a wholehearted belief

402
00:20:26.035 --> 00:20:30.925
that God could suspend his own created rules of physics,

403
00:20:32.195 --> 00:20:33.605
that people can't walk on water.

404
00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:35.765
You sink, right, that God created the

405
00:20:35.765 --> 00:20:37.045
rules to work that way.

406
00:20:37.505 --> 00:20:39.885
But he was already suspending it with Jesus.

407
00:20:40.265 --> 00:20:41.645
He could do it for Peter too.

408
00:20:43.225 --> 00:20:46.285
He believed that that was going to happen and God did.

409
00:20:46.465 --> 00:20:50.105
But here's the thing. It took Peter

410
00:20:50.855 --> 00:20:55.785
getting out of the boat in order to experience the joy

411
00:20:56.085 --> 00:20:57.265
of walking on the water.

412
00:20:59.085 --> 00:21:00.665
Now we know that he took his eyes off Jesus

413
00:21:00.765 --> 00:21:02.585
and he started sinking and Jesus had to save him.

414
00:21:02.585 --> 00:21:05.065
And that's part of it. But he had

415
00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:09.775
to step outta the boat first to trust

416
00:21:09.775 --> 00:21:12.415
that God was gonna do what he said he would do.

417
00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:17.445
So here's the thing. I don't think God did all that he did

418
00:21:17.505 --> 00:21:21.815
to save us, to keep us forever

419
00:21:21.995 --> 00:21:24.375
as his children, as as saved ones,

420
00:21:26.795 --> 00:21:29.965
just so that we would sit in these seats most Sundays

421
00:21:30.145 --> 00:21:32.565
and be a little bit better morally than everybody else.

422
00:21:34.645 --> 00:21:37.055
Like I don't think that's the extent

423
00:21:38.595 --> 00:21:41.895
of his salvation in our lives, his work to bring about all

424
00:21:41.895 --> 00:21:43.055
that he's done forever and ever.

425
00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:45.375
I don't think that's it.

426
00:21:48.605 --> 00:21:52.345
He saved us to walk in faith

427
00:21:52.885 --> 00:21:56.145
and to follow Jesus wherever he leads us,

428
00:21:58.515 --> 00:22:01.535
no matter the cost, no matter the

429
00:22:01.535 --> 00:22:04.095
risk, he saved us.

430
00:22:04.315 --> 00:22:06.935
Not just so that we could have some country club.

431
00:22:07.515 --> 00:22:09.735
He saved us so that we could follow him.

432
00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:11.415
And just think about what God did.

433
00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:13.135
You're thinking, man, I'm just an average person.

434
00:22:13.135 --> 00:22:14.175
Think about what God did

435
00:22:14.175 --> 00:22:16.455
through average people all over the Bible.

436
00:22:19.215 --> 00:22:22.825
Abraham left everything he knew to go

437
00:22:22.885 --> 00:22:24.225
to a land he didn't know.

438
00:22:24.485 --> 00:22:25.545
But all he knew was

439
00:22:25.545 --> 00:22:27.985
that God promised him something when he went.

440
00:22:30.605 --> 00:22:35.385
Or think about Moses confronting the most powerful man in

441
00:22:35.385 --> 00:22:38.345
the entire world, Pharaoh, with a stick

442
00:22:38.485 --> 00:22:39.625
and a promise from God.

443
00:22:43.435 --> 00:22:46.305
Think about Esther risking her

444
00:22:46.305 --> 00:22:48.665
life to save her people.

445
00:22:51.055 --> 00:22:54.595
Or you think about David trusting God

446
00:22:55.985 --> 00:22:58.325
in the face of a giant as everybody else ran

447
00:22:58.325 --> 00:23:01.875
and hid. 'cause David had a promise.

448
00:23:02.685 --> 00:23:05.295
David Knew a faithful God.

449
00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:11.695
But don't think we often read the Bible this way.

450
00:23:11.865 --> 00:23:13.575
Those people are not superheroes.

451
00:23:14.965 --> 00:23:17.335
They're flawed humans just like you and I.

452
00:23:17.365 --> 00:23:20.935
They just fully understood that they fully belong to God,

453
00:23:21.845 --> 00:23:23.815
that their life was in his hands.

454
00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:27.375
That that kind of belief that you say, God, I'm all yours.

455
00:23:27.565 --> 00:23:30.695
That frees us to hold our lives pretty loosely.

456
00:23:31.955 --> 00:23:33.535
Say, God, you're in charge of this.

457
00:23:33.775 --> 00:23:35.735
I can do whatever I need to to follow you

458
00:23:35.735 --> 00:23:39.895
because I trust you to hold my life loosely.

459
00:23:39.895 --> 00:23:41.935
What does that even mean? It means you recognize

460
00:23:41.935 --> 00:23:46.845
that you plans your career, your spouse, your children,

461
00:23:46.995 --> 00:23:51.485
your comfort zone, your dreams are all God's gifts

462
00:23:51.905 --> 00:23:53.085
for you to steward.

463
00:23:54.995 --> 00:23:57.845
They're not your possessions to clutch.

464
00:23:59.875 --> 00:24:01.765
This is God's gift of life

465
00:24:01.865 --> 00:24:04.285
and everything in it for his glory,

466
00:24:04.505 --> 00:24:05.925
for his purpose, for his kingdom.

467
00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:08.525
Not for me to hold onto.

468
00:24:09.385 --> 00:24:11.325
Not saying be reckless, be irresponsible.

469
00:24:11.385 --> 00:24:14.565
I'm just saying be available. Just be available

470
00:24:14.565 --> 00:24:15.845
saying God, okay, here's my life.

471
00:24:16.225 --> 00:24:18.685
I'm all in. And here's the beautiful truth about this.

472
00:24:18.985 --> 00:24:21.685
God is not asking you to come up with something new.

473
00:24:23.015 --> 00:24:24.315
You're sitting here thinking, well, okay,

474
00:24:24.495 --> 00:24:25.515
God wants me to follow him.

475
00:24:25.535 --> 00:24:28.395
God, I don't have to create something out of nothing.

476
00:24:28.825 --> 00:24:30.315
He's merely inviting you

477
00:24:30.495 --> 00:24:34.075
and inviting me to join him in what he's already doing

478
00:24:34.215 --> 00:24:35.875
and how he's already working.

479
00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:39.755
Listen to what Jesus said, John five 17, he said,

480
00:24:39.855 --> 00:24:44.275
my father is working until now and I am working.

481
00:24:46.385 --> 00:24:48.795
He's already working. He's been working forever

482
00:24:48.975 --> 00:24:51.315
and he's gonna be working forever forward.

483
00:24:52.145 --> 00:24:55.315
He's active. God is active in our world right now.

484
00:24:55.785 --> 00:24:59.075
He's doing things in the schools where our kids attend.

485
00:25:01.255 --> 00:25:04.025
He's doing things in the workplaces that you go

486
00:25:04.025 --> 00:25:05.065
to every day.

487
00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:07.065
He's working in our neighborhoods.

488
00:25:07.135 --> 00:25:10.425
He's working among the nations. He is stirring hearts.

489
00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:13.985
He's opening minds. He's drawing hearts to himself.

490
00:25:15.445 --> 00:25:16.785
So don't be intimidated.

491
00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:21.375
You have to come up with something new.

492
00:25:22.485 --> 00:25:24.655
Just recognize that he is moving, he's working,

493
00:25:24.755 --> 00:25:26.895
and he's just inviting you to step into

494
00:25:26.895 --> 00:25:28.335
that current that he's working.

495
00:25:28.645 --> 00:25:30.335
It's the famous Henry Blackaby quote,

496
00:25:30.335 --> 00:25:32.135
if you ever did experience in God, you know this.

497
00:25:33.005 --> 00:25:36.295
Find where God is at work and join him in it.

498
00:25:39.065 --> 00:25:41.035
Just look around. What is God doing?

499
00:25:41.655 --> 00:25:43.195
Be prayerfully observant

500
00:25:43.615 --> 00:25:45.795
and join him in it could mean all kinds of things.

501
00:25:45.935 --> 00:25:48.675
Having a conversation with a coworker who just happened

502
00:25:48.675 --> 00:25:51.555
to tell you that they're having a difficult time in their

503
00:25:51.555 --> 00:25:53.315
life right now, and they're the ones

504
00:25:53.315 --> 00:25:54.435
that, that you're the one that came to.

505
00:25:55.855 --> 00:25:56.915
Do you think that's an accident?

506
00:25:58.575 --> 00:26:02.035
That's God working in their life, inviting you

507
00:26:02.035 --> 00:26:02.995
to step into the current with

508
00:26:02.995 --> 00:26:07.705
them Serving here.

509
00:26:07.705 --> 00:26:09.185
We have ministries going all the time.

510
00:26:09.185 --> 00:26:10.185
You don't have to create something.

511
00:26:10.185 --> 00:26:11.265
You just say, what can I do?

512
00:26:12.165 --> 00:26:14.545
Or a local ministry that's serving our community.

513
00:26:14.565 --> 00:26:15.905
You just step into the current with them.

514
00:26:15.905 --> 00:26:17.945
They're already doing it. Don't create something.

515
00:26:18.095 --> 00:26:22.745
Just join what God is doing. You have professional skills.

516
00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:25.705
There's a need in our community that needs

517
00:26:25.705 --> 00:26:26.825
that professional skill.

518
00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:30.185
Go meet the need. Like don't create.

519
00:26:30.365 --> 00:26:31.585
You don't have to create something.

520
00:26:31.695 --> 00:26:34.345
Just go follow what God is doing.

521
00:26:34.685 --> 00:26:36.705
Or think about this somebody in your life

522
00:26:36.705 --> 00:26:38.865
or a group of people in your life who are skeptical

523
00:26:39.165 --> 00:26:43.765
or cynical about Christianity and you just show up in love

524
00:26:43.985 --> 00:26:46.605
and compassion over and over and over again.

525
00:26:48.445 --> 00:26:49.875
God's doing something in their life

526
00:26:50.135 --> 00:26:52.475
and they're talking about the faith and you just show up

527
00:26:53.055 --> 00:26:54.275
and you just be consistent.

528
00:26:55.915 --> 00:26:57.055
You don't have to have all the answers,

529
00:26:57.155 --> 00:26:58.775
but you can be a person that they trust.

530
00:26:59.035 --> 00:27:02.935
See, it's just in joining in with God and what he's doing.

531
00:27:03.275 --> 00:27:04.615
Be prayerfully observant

532
00:27:04.715 --> 00:27:07.415
and be ready to move when you sense his spirit leading

533
00:27:07.435 --> 00:27:08.455
you somewhere.

534
00:27:11.055 --> 00:27:13.705
Because here's the goal, a year from now, we look ahead.

535
00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:16.785
Let's say we're gonna do a celebration Sunday, August 15th,

536
00:27:16.785 --> 00:27:17.785
16th, next year.

537
00:27:18.685 --> 00:27:20.305
What's our goal between now and then?

538
00:27:20.845 --> 00:27:21.905
What's, what does it look like?

539
00:27:22.255 --> 00:27:25.425
Well, listen, our goal is not just a bigger church

540
00:27:26.125 --> 00:27:27.705
or a better celebration Sunday.

541
00:27:27.805 --> 00:27:29.505
We got more stories, we all kinds of stuff.

542
00:27:29.585 --> 00:27:31.025
A bigger banner out there. Like what?

543
00:27:31.205 --> 00:27:32.505
No, that's not the goal here.

544
00:27:34.125 --> 00:27:38.185
The goal is what Jesus said in Matthew five 14 through 16.

545
00:27:39.515 --> 00:27:41.145
Jesus said, you are the light of the world.

546
00:27:42.745 --> 00:27:44.705
A city set on a hill cannot be hidden,

547
00:27:45.525 --> 00:27:47.825
nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket,

548
00:27:48.005 --> 00:27:49.145
but they put it on a stand

549
00:27:49.165 --> 00:27:51.305
and it gives light to all in the house.

550
00:27:52.285 --> 00:27:54.065
In the same way, let your light shine

551
00:27:54.065 --> 00:27:56.665
before others so that they may see your good works

552
00:27:57.045 --> 00:28:00.705
and give glory to your father who is in heaven.

553
00:28:02.145 --> 00:28:04.725
That's the goal. And he talked about light and darkness.

554
00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:07.565
Think about light. Light doesn't have to work hard

555
00:28:07.865 --> 00:28:09.205
to push out the darkness.

556
00:28:11.035 --> 00:28:12.175
It just has to shine.

557
00:28:14.545 --> 00:28:17.565
And Jesus said it must be visible in order

558
00:28:17.565 --> 00:28:18.885
to make a difference.

559
00:28:22.965 --> 00:28:25.745
Listen, church, our world is hungry

560
00:28:27.155 --> 00:28:28.615
for authentic light.

561
00:28:31.745 --> 00:28:36.275
They've tried and seen too many shallow solutions,

562
00:28:37.695 --> 00:28:42.265
too much empty hope that there's a need,

563
00:28:42.745 --> 00:28:46.545
a hunger for something real, for a light that shines,

564
00:28:46.815 --> 00:28:50.065
that can stand up to their pain

565
00:28:51.005 --> 00:28:53.945
and still offer genuine love and hope through it.

566
00:28:55.815 --> 00:28:56.905
Something that's going

567
00:28:56.925 --> 00:28:59.785
to actually make a difference in their life.

568
00:29:00.485 --> 00:29:02.985
That's the kind light that we carry,

569
00:29:04.135 --> 00:29:07.305
that God has put in us as believers.

570
00:29:12.595 --> 00:29:13.765
They're looking for something.

571
00:29:14.305 --> 00:29:16.725
We have what they are looking for.

572
00:29:16.785 --> 00:29:19.205
And it's not to give us glory, as Jesus said, it's

573
00:29:19.205 --> 00:29:20.645
to glorify our Father who's in heaven.

574
00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:25.215
And so that's good news.

575
00:29:26.035 --> 00:29:27.375
But let's not forget something here.

576
00:29:27.945 --> 00:29:31.015
Let's not forget there's an enemy that we have as well.

577
00:29:34.015 --> 00:29:37.675
And that enemy of our souls is not afraid

578
00:29:38.615 --> 00:29:42.875
of our programs, of our building, building, of the fact

579
00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:44.995
that a few hundred of us gather in here every Sunday.

580
00:29:46.195 --> 00:29:47.415
He doesn't care about that at all.

581
00:29:47.605 --> 00:29:52.255
What he's terrified of is a group of people whose lives are

582
00:29:52.255 --> 00:29:54.215
so transformed by the gospel that they're willing

583
00:29:54.235 --> 00:29:58.135
to go obey their savior and Lord in anything they do.

584
00:30:00.205 --> 00:30:02.255
He's terrified of transformed lives

585
00:30:03.275 --> 00:30:04.655
by the gospel of Jesus Christ.

586
00:30:06.265 --> 00:30:07.325
He knows he can't win.

587
00:30:07.585 --> 00:30:09.605
He knows he can't do anything against it.

588
00:30:09.795 --> 00:30:14.005
He's terrified of people who are so secure in their, their,

589
00:30:14.295 --> 00:30:17.565
their security, their faith, their future in Christ.

590
00:30:17.635 --> 00:30:21.405
They're so secure that they live with this prayerful hope

591
00:30:21.555 --> 00:30:24.205
that they're risking their bold in their faith.

592
00:30:24.315 --> 00:30:25.605
He's terrified of that

593
00:30:25.605 --> 00:30:28.005
because he knows that is what defeats him.

594
00:30:30.925 --> 00:30:34.595
Again, Jesus did not die on the cross so that we could live

595
00:30:35.115 --> 00:30:37.035
cautious self-protecting lives.

596
00:30:40.415 --> 00:30:43.035
He died so that we could live with the kind of freedom

597
00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:48.815
that comes from knowing our ultimate security is found in

598
00:30:48.815 --> 00:30:50.615
him, not in our circumstances.

599
00:30:53.915 --> 00:30:56.215
He died so we could love people like he loved us,

600
00:30:56.785 --> 00:30:58.375
which is costly and risky.

601
00:31:01.075 --> 00:31:04.175
And so in light of all of this today, be prayerful.

602
00:31:05.595 --> 00:31:08.375
Be available. Open your hands.

603
00:31:08.915 --> 00:31:12.775
Be willing to be uncomfortable and just take the next step

604
00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:17.175
because there's nothing better than watching God use your

605
00:31:17.285 --> 00:31:20.015
life to impact somebody else.

606
00:31:21.765 --> 00:31:24.495
It's not about comfort and convenience and preference

607
00:31:24.495 --> 00:31:25.655
and getting what you want.

608
00:31:25.845 --> 00:31:28.375
It's about watching the God of the universe choose

609
00:31:28.375 --> 00:31:29.815
to use you in somebody else.

610
00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:31.175
It is unbelievable

611
00:31:31.275 --> 00:31:35.455
and it's joy filling, life giving to participate in that.

612
00:31:36.395 --> 00:31:38.455
And remember, he's faithful,

613
00:31:40.355 --> 00:31:42.855
so you can follow him wherever he leads

614
00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:44.015
you without any fear.

615
00:31:45.595 --> 00:31:47.095
But it's gonna cost. It's gonna be risky.

616
00:31:47.275 --> 00:31:49.055
You can follow him because he's faithful.

617
00:31:49.165 --> 00:31:50.895
He's done it before. He's gonna do it again.

618
00:31:55.175 --> 00:31:56.255
I want you to see this video.
