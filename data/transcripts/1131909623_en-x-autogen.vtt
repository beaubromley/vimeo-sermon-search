WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:00.365
Yeah,

2
00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:08.165
18.

3
00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:17.885
If you haven't, uh, picked up notes

4
00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:20.445
or whatever you'd like to do, go ahead and do that.

5
00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:24.085
We have them sessions, the

6
00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:27.845
verses and things like that.

7
00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:32.645
We'll get started. David tells me it's time to start.

8
00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.205
I do what tells you to do often,

9
00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.805
not all the time, but often.

10
00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:44.285
Well, welcome. Uh, my name's Steve Murdoch,

11
00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:47.565
and, uh, Maybe I need this,

12
00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:52.325
but, uh, I had the privilege of serving as one

13
00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:54.245
of your elders and, uh,

14
00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:56.285
and been serving in that role

15
00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:58.325
for a little over five, no four years.

16
00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:01.965
And, uh, Lewis and Ryan Whitaker

17
00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:03.325
and I came on at the same time.

18
00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:07.765
And there were a total of, uh, nine of us, Alan,

19
00:01:07.905 --> 00:01:09.805
and that's there in the back, and John

20
00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:11.325
and Aaron back in the back.

21
00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:16.205
And, uh, and then our newest elders, uh, Trevor, uh,

22
00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:17.645
Chris and Dan.

23
00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.285
I think Trevor will be teaching next week,

24
00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:22.445
and then Chris will be following the

25
00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:23.645
next 12 weeks after that.

26
00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:29.765
And, uh, and then Dan has previously

27
00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:30.965
taught us a couple sessions.

28
00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:34.845
So, um, Joe Williams is currently on sabbatical.

29
00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:38.525
And, uh, prior to serving as an elder, I was a deacon

30
00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:41.445
and my wife Denise, and I lead a community group.

31
00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:44.365
And we've been at Henderson for nearly 19 years.

32
00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:46.885
Uh, I've also had the great joy

33
00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:50.685
of working in the cafe twice a month as, uh, a baker.

34
00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.045
Um, you know,

35
00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:55.365
everything we've made in new cafe is from scratch

36
00:01:55.785 --> 00:01:57.925
and, uh, not really.

37
00:02:00.865 --> 00:02:03.805
And I have a, so, uh, people will come in

38
00:02:03.805 --> 00:02:06.205
and say, they'll do the line

39
00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:09.045
and say, you know, I'm really kind of watching what I eat,

40
00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:11.485
so I think I'll have a scone instead of a donut.

41
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.005
Lemme just give you the, there's really no,

42
00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:16.485
there's not better for you,

43
00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:19.045
but if it makes you feel good, that's okay.

44
00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:22.685
Uh, you know, I, uh, at least I've been married

45
00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:26.765
for 42 years, and, uh, we have two daughters,

46
00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:28.605

00:02:28.605 --> 00:02:31.365
as a women's ministry director here, our church,

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:34.325
her husband is Jason, who's part of the worship band,

49
00:02:34.465 --> 00:02:35.845
and they lead a community group.

50
00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.765
And they have our two oldest grandchildren, deacon,

51
00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:40.485

and Salem, who turns 11 tomorrow.

53
00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:45.565
Our other daughter, Maggie Nichols,

54
00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.765
and her husband David, are part

55
00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:49.725

00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:53.525
planted Providence Baptist and are serving there with Brett

57
00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:54.965
and a lot of other folks.

58
00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:57.125
Maggie has her own communications

59
00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:58.805
and fundraising consulting business

60
00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:02.365
and serves on the Edmond City Council for some crazy reason.

61
00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:05.685
Uh, David serves an assistant United States attorney

62
00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.125
for the Western District of Oklahoma,

63
00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:10.445
and we have our two youngest grandchildren, uh, Corey,

64
00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:12.125
who turns eight on November 3rd,

65
00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:14.765
and married, who turned five on October 21st.

66
00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:18.285
Mallory's Mallory's birthday is on November 13th.

67
00:03:19.085 --> 00:03:20.885
Denise's birthday is on December 9th,

68
00:03:20.905 --> 00:03:23.205
and Maggie's birthday is on December 28th.

69
00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:25.525
So these are busy birthday times for us.

70
00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:28.165
I just mentioned that because it seems to be the focus

71
00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:29.405
of our family right now.

72
00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:31.605
Uh, I retired almost two years ago

73
00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:36.045
after serving here, 36 years as a city attorney lived Mond.

74
00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:40.525
And tonight, uh, I'll spend most of my time talking

75
00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:41.605
and sharing about prayer.

76
00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:45.245
A little bit of brief time on angels and Satan and demons.

77
00:03:46.105 --> 00:03:49.205
And I'll turn it over to Jacob, uh, who will, uh,

78
00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:54.125
he will close with, uh, uh, more information about that,

79
00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:57.405
and we'll close with him

80
00:03:57.545 --> 00:04:01.565
and prayer like we normally do, as I'm sure many of you do.

81
00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:04.925
Uh, I read several devotionals every day, usually

82
00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:06.925
between five 30 and six o'clock in the morning.

83
00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:11.085
And, uh, several couple of 'em I've been,

84
00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:15.005
i I use right now is, uh, it's, uh, called Truth

85
00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:16.845
for Life, Alistair Bay.

86
00:04:17.785 --> 00:04:22.085
And then, you know, it's purely a coincidence that, uh,

87
00:04:23.505 --> 00:04:26.045
is the topic for his little devotional today, was

88
00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:27.725
that the Devil Defanged

89
00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:32.125
and, uh, talked about demons

90
00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:35.845
and domain of darkness, truly coincidence.

91
00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:40.685
And then the other, uh, devotional that I read,

92
00:04:41.475 --> 00:04:46.285
read this Morning with Truth for Life, uh, C Per,

93
00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:51.525
and the title was How Do We Pray The, so

94
00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:55.205
they weren't, I didn't talk to those guys about

95
00:04:55.205 --> 00:04:56.365
what we were gonna talk about tonight,

96
00:04:56.585 --> 00:05:00.045
but, uh, I think that's, uh, pretty amazing to me.

97
00:05:00.485 --> 00:05:02.525
I sat there this morning and looked at those, I said, well,

98
00:05:03.155 --> 00:05:04.245
Lord, is servingly our time.

99
00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:08.885
So one other thing I just want to mention, uh,

100
00:05:09.265 --> 00:05:10.605
really in conjunction with prayer,

101
00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:13.365
the Elder Council meets the first

102
00:05:14.025 --> 00:05:16.245
and third Tuesday of each month in the church office,

103
00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:19.205
and we always start our meeting in prayer,

104
00:05:20.105 --> 00:05:21.525
and we consider it a privilege

105
00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:24.485
and a blessing to have the opportunity to pray with members.

106
00:05:25.715 --> 00:05:28.135
And each of you're welcome to meet with the elders

107
00:05:28.135 --> 00:05:29.375
for prayer and for other issues.

108
00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:32.335
Uh, we card at six o'clock

109
00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:37.015
and, uh, I think I can speak for all my brothers that, uh,

110
00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:40.575
one of the greatest poses we have is to pray, um,

111
00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:42.495
and pray for each one of you.

112
00:05:43.035 --> 00:05:46.535
And, uh, so, uh, I think my paper was out.

113
00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:48.055
I have my email address as well

114
00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:50.815
as the elder's Counsel email, email address.

115
00:05:51.475 --> 00:05:53.855
So please feel free to contact us at any time

116
00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:55.895
to schedule a time to meet with us.

117
00:05:56.945 --> 00:06:01.645
We, um, a lot of times the prayers relate to health issues

118
00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:04.165
and things like that, but they also relate

119
00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:06.765
to just things going on in people's lives. And,

120
00:06:06.905 --> 00:06:08.925
Uh, It's a privilege for us to pray.

121
00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:11.485
So why don't we begin our time in prayer

122
00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:13.405
and, uh, let's do that.

123
00:06:13.425 --> 00:06:16.245
So, heaven, me, father, I, I thank, uh, you

124
00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:18.885
for the opportunity to be together with these folks.

125
00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:22.565
And, uh, I pray that you'll bless our time together.

126
00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:26.565
We praise you, we praise your name.

127
00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:30.565
We're thankful for the things that you do for us.

128
00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:34.205
We thank you for the privilege of prayer,

129
00:06:35.025 --> 00:06:36.845
for the opportunity to confess our sins

130
00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:40.765
before you, for the opportunity to present requests to you,

131
00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:43.645
for the opportunity to listen to you

132
00:06:43.785 --> 00:06:45.685
as we communicate with you.

133
00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:49.845
Lord, I just thank you for our time together tonight.

134
00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:52.365
I pray your blessings upon each one of us.

135
00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:55.845
Pray for good health. Pray for those

136
00:06:55.845 --> 00:06:58.045
that are struggling in various areas of their life.

137
00:06:58.275 --> 00:07:02.845
Pray for encouragement. So, Lord, bless our time, me pray.

138
00:07:02.975 --> 00:07:03.325
Thank

139
00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:14.845
So prayer defined

140
00:07:17.525 --> 00:07:19.325
a lot of different definitions

141
00:07:19.385 --> 00:07:21.045
or thoughts about what prayer is.

142
00:07:22.105 --> 00:07:25.845
Um, short answer might be personal communication with God.

143
00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:33.565
Hebrews four 16 says, let us then with confidence, draw near

144
00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:36.725
to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy

145
00:07:37.505 --> 00:07:39.925
and find grace to help in time of need,

146
00:07:41.945 --> 00:07:44.245
The confidence that we have to draw near to the throne

147
00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:47.565
of grace that

148
00:07:47.725 --> 00:07:49.245
should provide comfort.

149
00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:52.925
John Newton put the opportunity of prayer wonderfully well.

150
00:07:53.785 --> 00:07:57.125
He said, approach my soul, the mercy seat

151
00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:58.765
where Jesus answered prayer.

152
00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:02.805
They're humbled before his feet for none.

153
00:08:02.985 --> 00:08:07.525
Parish there by promises, by only plea with this venture,

154
00:08:07.885 --> 00:08:11.435
I, I thou call us burden souls to be

155
00:08:12.295 --> 00:08:14.195
and such, oh Lord, am I

156
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:20.155
Written In 1779, the opportunity to be at the foot

157
00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:25.715
in mercy seat to be near man's chief end is

158
00:08:25.715 --> 00:08:27.675
to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.

159
00:08:28.895 --> 00:08:32.115
So how better to glorify God

160
00:08:32.135 --> 00:08:33.515
and to enjoy him through prayer.

161
00:08:35.555 --> 00:08:38.635
I think about that prayer is an offering up

162
00:08:38.635 --> 00:08:40.035
of our desires unto God.

163
00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:44.755
The things agreeable to his will in the name of Christ

164
00:08:45.665 --> 00:08:47.275
with confession of our sins

165
00:08:47.335 --> 00:08:50.955
and thankful acknowledgement Of his mercies.

166
00:08:51.895 --> 00:08:53.675
The Westminster shorter categories.

167
00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:56.925
Well, during my training to be an elder,

168
00:08:57.205 --> 00:08:58.845
I was given a book and paddled prayer.

169
00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:03.965
And how praying together shapes the church by John with uk

170
00:09:04.705 --> 00:09:08.205
and he suggests several di several definitions for prayer.

171
00:09:08.785 --> 00:09:10.285
And he quotes several other offers.

172
00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:14.805
He says, prayer is talking to God.

173
00:09:14.805 --> 00:09:17.525
Well, we kind of covered that. Communicate with God.

174
00:09:18.705 --> 00:09:21.005
He says, prayer is demanding something from God.

175
00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:23.485
Well, demanding is kind of a hard word for me,

176
00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:26.165
but I guess when we request things, when we're asking

177
00:09:26.345 --> 00:09:30.605
for something, uh, prayer is aligning our will

178
00:09:30.605 --> 00:09:31.725
with God's.

179
00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:35.725
He said, prayer is more for you than it is for God.

180
00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:40.925
Prayer is more for you than it's for God.

181
00:09:41.945 --> 00:09:44.885
Prayer is wishful thinking aimed in God's direction.

182
00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:49.325
Prayer is some combination of all these things.

183
00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:54.245
Gary Villard has written a book on prayer entitled,

184
00:09:54.245 --> 00:09:55.525
calling on the name of the Lord,

185
00:09:56.485 --> 00:09:57.925
a Biblical Theology of Prayer.

186
00:09:58.745 --> 00:10:02.485
His conclusion, prayer is calling on God

187
00:10:02.505 --> 00:10:03.805
to come through on his promise.

188
00:10:05.635 --> 00:10:08.455
The first in instance of recorded prayer in the Bible,

189
00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:12.335
the courages in Genesis chapter four, outside

190
00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:13.375
of the Garden of Eden.

191
00:10:14.195 --> 00:10:18.175
In Genesis four verses 25 to 26, it says,

192
00:10:18.355 --> 00:10:20.855
and Adam knew his wife again and she bore his son

193
00:10:20.875 --> 00:10:23.015
and called his name Seth Verse.

194
00:10:23.015 --> 00:10:26.975
He said, God has appointed from me another offspring instead

195
00:10:26.975 --> 00:10:29.335
of Abel, for Cain killed him.

196
00:10:30.615 --> 00:10:32.455
'cause Seth also a son was born

197
00:10:33.115 --> 00:10:34.655
and he called his name Enoch.

198
00:10:35.505 --> 00:10:37.965
At that time, people began

199
00:10:37.965 --> 00:10:40.485
to call upon the name of the Lord.

200
00:10:42.385 --> 00:10:44.005
The commentary on these verses states

201
00:10:44.005 --> 00:10:46.045
that Adam Eve have another son, Seth.

202
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.725
These people want God to fulfill his promise, even if

203
00:10:49.725 --> 00:10:52.335
that day isn't today, when people begin

204
00:10:52.335 --> 00:10:53.935
to call on his promise of his son,

205
00:10:54.835 --> 00:10:56.055
who will reverse the curse

206
00:10:56.115 --> 00:10:57.255
and defeat of the circuit,

207
00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:01.135
John Calvin has asserts prayer in the Bible's intimately

208
00:11:01.135 --> 00:11:04.825
linked to the gospel, God's promise and

209
00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:06.825
provided solution to the problem of you

210
00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:09.625
and against him and its consequences.

211
00:11:11.005 --> 00:11:12.825
The gospel shape of prayer is evident

212
00:11:12.925 --> 00:11:14.465
for the opening pages of the Bible.

213
00:11:15.205 --> 00:11:19.145
And in particular, Genesis 4 26, when people first begin

214
00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:22.185
to call him the name of Yahweh, right through the end,

215
00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:26.985
when the church pray, come Lord Jesus in Revelation 2020.

216
00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:31.985
Throughout, throughout the entire Bible, in a sense

217
00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:34.625
the prayer is saying, are we there yet?

218
00:11:34.725 --> 00:11:37.865
God? Prayer brings about the things

219
00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:40.905
that you promised you would, prayer in the Bible is linked

220
00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:43.625
to the hope of redemption and thus the gospel.

221
00:11:44.855 --> 00:11:47.465
Finally, you might think a prayer is God's prescription

222
00:11:47.485 --> 00:11:48.945
for life in the fall in the world.

223
00:11:49.905 --> 00:11:54.605
I, a couple

224
00:11:54.605 --> 00:11:55.605
different types of prayer.

225
00:11:57.035 --> 00:11:59.925
Well, there's the prayer for poten, petition

226
00:12:00.025 --> 00:12:04.405
or intervention, prayers of confession of sin,

227
00:12:06.355 --> 00:12:10.245
prayers of adoration, praises

228
00:12:10.265 --> 00:12:11.365
and thanksgiving.

229
00:12:14.055 --> 00:12:17.205
God's communicating to us as his response.

230
00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.805
So why do we pray?

231
00:12:25.425 --> 00:12:26.805
Any thoughts about why we pray

232
00:12:33.465 --> 00:12:34.325
The Bible tell you.

233
00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:36.525
I was gonna say obedience is Obed one of them?

234
00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:39.365
Does it express our trust in God?

235
00:12:40.045 --> 00:12:44.965
Absolutely Dependence. We love him.

236
00:12:45.825 --> 00:12:47.325
We want to have fellowship with him.

237
00:12:49.395 --> 00:12:50.615
One of the best ways to do that,

238
00:12:51.215 --> 00:12:53.735
I think our example is Jesus, right?

239
00:12:54.435 --> 00:12:56.455
He pray a lot, A lot.

240
00:13:00.355 --> 00:13:03.015
God allows us as creatures to be involved in,

241
00:13:03.155 --> 00:13:05.975
in activities that are eternally important.

242
00:13:10.005 --> 00:13:13.895
Praying for others, praying for the salvation

243
00:13:13.915 --> 00:13:17.175
of other people, praying for wisdom, praying for the wisdom

244
00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.695
decision to make our wi better.

245
00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:25.255
Those of us who have had children praying for the salvation

246
00:13:25.275 --> 00:13:28.815
of our children, family members,

247
00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:32.975
difficult, difficult circumstances, healing.

248
00:13:34.075 --> 00:13:38.415
So pray for our leaders. Pray for our leaders, pray

249
00:13:38.415 --> 00:13:40.535
for one another, pray for boldness.

250
00:13:41.775 --> 00:13:43.135
Boldness in our, in our

251
00:13:44.175 --> 00:13:47.655
testimony, forgiveness.

252
00:13:52.035 --> 00:13:54.215
We give glory to God in our prayers. Mm-hmm.

253
00:13:57.035 --> 00:14:01.415
So how does prayer work?

254
00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:07.575
James? Four, two says, you do not have,

255
00:14:07.575 --> 00:14:08.975
because you do not ask.

256
00:14:11.765 --> 00:14:14.215
Luke 11, nine through 10 says, and I tell you, ask

257
00:14:14.235 --> 00:14:15.655
and it'll be given to you.

258
00:14:16.205 --> 00:14:18.415
Seek and you will find knock. And it'll be open to you.

259
00:14:18.915 --> 00:14:22.175
For everyone who asks, receives, and the one who seeks fines

260
00:14:22.675 --> 00:14:24.615
and to the one who knocks, it will be open.

261
00:14:29.695 --> 00:14:33.695
Question, How

262
00:14:33.695 --> 00:14:34.855
much do we actually pray

263
00:14:38.315 --> 00:14:38.775
For? What,

264
00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:40.615
How often should we pray?

265
00:14:41.685 --> 00:14:43.135
Without season, without

266
00:14:43.135 --> 00:14:44.135
Season?

267
00:14:45.915 --> 00:14:49.695
So what is the minimum amount

268
00:14:49.695 --> 00:14:51.805
of time should we be spending in prayer?

269
00:14:52.065 --> 00:14:53.485
And so

270
00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:57.085
what about prayer without cing verse Thessalonians five 17.

271
00:15:01.945 --> 00:15:04.045
How do we, how do we evaluate ourselves?

272
00:15:04.145 --> 00:15:07.965
And how much time we pray, is that a tough question to ask?

273
00:15:07.965 --> 00:15:12.725
Sometimes we hear a catch ourselves

274
00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:15.805
wondering, I should have prayed about that,

275
00:15:17.865 --> 00:15:22.485
or I prayed about that

276
00:15:22.825 --> 00:15:25.525
and I'm not sure got my response.

277
00:15:27.545 --> 00:15:28.805
So do I need to pray again?

278
00:15:34.395 --> 00:15:35.725
Your Relationship, how

279
00:15:35.985 --> 00:15:36.985
Was it?

280
00:15:37.825 --> 00:15:38.825
Mm-hmm.

281
00:15:40.025 --> 00:15:42.605
Is it more than just a blessing of a meal? Is it,

282
00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:50.805
it's a tough one for often, um, husbands and wives

283
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.645
and been something that Denise

284
00:15:52.645 --> 00:15:54.925
and I have not done as well as we should, is pray

285
00:15:54.925 --> 00:15:56.845
with our wives and our spouses.

286
00:15:57.985 --> 00:16:00.165
Uh, Our family members.

287
00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:06.445
Luke 18, one it says,

288
00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.285
and he told 'em a parable to the effect

289
00:16:08.285 --> 00:16:11.365
that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.

290
00:16:12.675 --> 00:16:14.765
Then there is second Chronicle, seven 14.

291
00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:18.925
If my people who are called by my name humble themselves

292
00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:21.965
and pray and seek my face

293
00:16:22.225 --> 00:16:23.885
and turn from their wicked ways,

294
00:16:24.755 --> 00:16:29.045
then I will hear from heaven and their sin

295
00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:30.565
and heal their land.

296
00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:34.725
So it sounds like current,

297
00:16:35.645 --> 00:16:39.525
I have an element of humility there. Um,

298
00:16:40.475 --> 00:16:44.205
Because We often think about,

299
00:16:45.185 --> 00:16:47.885
or I often think about, I can kind of do this on my own,

300
00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:50.885
and then when the times get a little

301
00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:52.565
difficult, maybe it's the time.

302
00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:55.645
That's a confession. I have,

303
00:17:00.045 --> 00:17:03.045
I remember in the years past when, uh, I was working

304
00:17:03.225 --> 00:17:05.125
for a living and, uh,

305
00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:08.005
I'd be down at the Oklahoma County Courthouse and,

306
00:17:08.025 --> 00:17:09.525
and I'd be involved in something

307
00:17:09.525 --> 00:17:11.245
that I thought was pretty important at the time,

308
00:17:12.385 --> 00:17:15.605
and I might have some anxiety on my way there, thinking,

309
00:17:15.605 --> 00:17:16.605
well, how's this gonna turn out?

310
00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:20.535
Maybe after being down there for a couple days,

311
00:17:20.535 --> 00:17:21.975
trying a lawsuit or something

312
00:17:22.035 --> 00:17:24.535
and going back to the parking garage

313
00:17:24.795 --> 00:17:29.695
and coming out on maybe the, a good end of a decision

314
00:17:31.075 --> 00:17:32.815
making, the Lord thank you.

315
00:17:33.255 --> 00:17:34.335
I really appreciate that.

316
00:17:34.825 --> 00:17:35.935
Thank you for being with me

317
00:17:35.935 --> 00:17:38.575
during this difficult circumstance, during something that

318
00:17:39.335 --> 00:17:40.815
I thought was important at the time.

319
00:17:41.835 --> 00:17:46.055
Um, And then I think, whoa, was it okay

320
00:17:46.075 --> 00:17:47.415
to pray for a good decision?

321
00:17:48.685 --> 00:17:53.085
What I was doing? Um, thought it was, uh,

322
00:17:53.235 --> 00:17:57.085
that I remember to be grateful, uh, that I remember

323
00:17:57.085 --> 00:18:01.085
to be thankful, that I remember to be humble and, and,

324
00:18:01.305 --> 00:18:04.605
and how it turned out that I remember to pray.

325
00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:07.525
What? It didn't turn out as good as it, I hope

326
00:18:08.555 --> 00:18:10.085
because there was a judge

327
00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:12.005
who felt like something different should happen.

328
00:18:13.305 --> 00:18:14.805
But still be thankful that,

329
00:18:20.095 --> 00:18:24.555
so I, I go back to how often should we prayer?

330
00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:25.915
How much do we ask for pray?

331
00:18:25.915 --> 00:18:29.795
And I think that's something we should always

332
00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:31.035
constantly be thinking

333
00:18:31.035 --> 00:18:32.035
About.

334
00:18:32.675 --> 00:18:34.035
I dunno if we can over pray.

335
00:18:37.855 --> 00:18:39.355
That's that be my experience.

336
00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:45.075
Next topic, I think I had on the outline of

337
00:18:45.645 --> 00:18:47.435
Jesus Christ, our mediator.

338
00:18:49.665 --> 00:18:54.525
And the question that I wrote here, um, I think I said,

339
00:18:54.555 --> 00:18:56.845
does God hear the prayer of unbeliev?

340
00:18:59.415 --> 00:19:03.085
Let's say we about the prayer, hear God hear the answer,

341
00:19:05.235 --> 00:19:07.565
hearing prayer, thoughts?

342
00:19:09.345 --> 00:19:13.325
Is that a question we talk about? Yes.

343
00:19:14.485 --> 00:19:18.245
Variable image

344
00:19:21.515 --> 00:19:23.965
reflect His who He's in our life.

345
00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:26.165
So you gotta start somewhere, right?

346
00:19:28.555 --> 00:19:29.645
Anybody else? No.

347
00:19:32.175 --> 00:19:35.405
Steve, do you, do you mean hear the prayer

348
00:19:35.545 --> 00:19:37.645
or do you mean like, honor

349
00:19:38.145 --> 00:19:41.565
and listen with an intent

350
00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:43.645
to answer the prayer?

351
00:19:44.095 --> 00:19:46.685
There is a distinction. This could be two different things.

352
00:19:46.855 --> 00:19:51.605
Those are two different things God

353
00:19:51.605 --> 00:19:53.765
always hears in the sense he is aware

354
00:19:54.705 --> 00:19:56.565
of the prayers made by him believers.

355
00:19:56.985 --> 00:20:00.525
And he may from time to time answer their prayers out

356
00:20:00.525 --> 00:20:02.405
of his mercy and in his,

357
00:20:02.665 --> 00:20:06.205
and in a desire to bring him in to salvation through Christ.

358
00:20:07.355 --> 00:20:11.525
However, God has nowhere promised to respond

359
00:20:11.525 --> 00:20:13.005
to the prayers of unbelievers.

360
00:20:14.145 --> 00:20:16.605
The only prayers that he has promised to hear in the sense

361
00:20:16.605 --> 00:20:20.085
of listening with his, Dan says, a sympathetic here

362
00:20:20.705 --> 00:20:23.805
and an undertaking to answer when they're made, according

363
00:20:23.825 --> 00:20:27.725
to his book, are the prayers of Christians offered

364
00:20:27.725 --> 00:20:30.085
through the one mediator of Jesus Christ.

365
00:20:31.115 --> 00:20:33.045
Compare this statement that was made by Rudo

366
00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:35.405
to John 14, six.

367
00:20:35.935 --> 00:20:38.605
Jesus said to him, I'm the way, the truth and alive.

368
00:20:38.785 --> 00:20:40.965
No one comes to the Father except for me.

369
00:20:41.925 --> 00:20:43.585
So this idea of coming through Jesus

370
00:20:46.305 --> 00:20:47.485
according to is

371
00:20:48.355 --> 00:20:51.965
Will I?

372
00:20:52.115 --> 00:20:56.725
That that was the question about God is omni, Omni,

373
00:20:59.205 --> 00:21:00.725
I know I may not even pronounce that word,

374
00:21:03.185 --> 00:21:04.885
but all rolling.

375
00:21:06.545 --> 00:21:09.885
All hearing. But the fact that he would've,

376
00:21:09.885 --> 00:21:11.045
the sympathetic ear

377
00:21:12.055 --> 00:21:14.165
Would Be a distinction. Yes.

378
00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:18.045
He listened to Cornelius mm-hmm. Um,

379
00:21:19.265 --> 00:21:20.605
So much that he sent Peter over.

380
00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:22.045
Go, go talk to him.

381
00:21:22.425 --> 00:21:26.365
So Cornelius didn't know Jesus yet, but he was seeking God

382
00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:28.765
and God heard that. Yeah.

383
00:21:29.575 --> 00:21:33.165
Which we believe what led to the salvation. Yeah.

384
00:21:37.235 --> 00:21:39.935
Letter I had written down. In whose name do we pray?

385
00:21:40.685 --> 00:21:44.895
John 14, 13 through 14 says, whatever you ask in my name,

386
00:21:45.005 --> 00:21:46.775
this I will do that.

387
00:21:46.775 --> 00:21:48.775
The Father may be glorified in the Son.

388
00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:51.935
If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

389
00:21:53.195 --> 00:21:54.895
The question, should we pray to Jesus

390
00:21:55.035 --> 00:21:56.135
and or to the Holy Spirit?

391
00:21:57.995 --> 00:22:00.915
I think Gdo says it, it doesn't hurt. Yeah.

392
00:22:01.265 --> 00:22:04.075
It's not going to hurt anything. They are one Yeah,

393
00:22:07.495 --> 00:22:10.315
God the Father, God the Son, the Holy Spirit

394
00:22:11.485 --> 00:22:13.195
don't remember thinking a lot about

395
00:22:13.195 --> 00:22:14.435
praying to the Holy Spirit.

396
00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:20.035
Um, but David gives a good answer. It doesn't hurt.

397
00:22:21.615 --> 00:22:23.995
Uh, There's no prayers directly addressed

398
00:22:23.995 --> 00:22:26.235
to the Holy Spirit or reported in the New Testament.

399
00:22:26.665 --> 00:22:28.395
There's nothing that would forbid such

400
00:22:28.395 --> 00:22:31.395
prayer for the Holy Spirit.

401
00:22:31.425 --> 00:22:34.435
Like the Father of the Son is fully, God is worthy

402
00:22:34.495 --> 00:22:35.955
of prayer and is powerful.

403
00:22:36.295 --> 00:22:38.795
To answer our prayer, he is our helper,

404
00:22:39.495 --> 00:22:42.475
our advocate, or our counselor.

405
00:22:44.295 --> 00:22:46.155
The Court agreement does not seem wrong

406
00:22:46.175 --> 00:22:49.195
to pray directly to the Holy Spirit when you were asking him

407
00:22:49.195 --> 00:22:51.555
to do something, relates directly to his special areas

408
00:22:51.615 --> 00:22:52.955
of ministry or responsibility,

409
00:22:53.815 --> 00:22:54.995
or agreed in further state,

410
00:22:54.995 --> 00:22:57.355
that since this is not due testament pattern,

411
00:22:58.135 --> 00:22:59.515
it should not become the dominant

412
00:22:59.915 --> 00:23:00.955
emphasis in our prayer life.

413
00:23:02.425 --> 00:23:04.395
Something think about. So think

414
00:23:04.395 --> 00:23:05.875
About, um,

415
00:23:09.095 --> 00:23:11.715
So how can I be sure that my prayers will be affected?

416
00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:15.275
Make sure it's within his will.

417
00:23:15.825 --> 00:23:18.075
Okay. Know God wo

418
00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:21.995
About Who He's, what's his character?

419
00:23:22.425 --> 00:23:23.555
What does he want for us?

420
00:23:28.735 --> 00:23:29.155
Humble.

421
00:23:34.735 --> 00:23:36.515
His chest. Right.

422
00:23:38.185 --> 00:23:42.035
Well, you know, I, Matthew six,

423
00:23:44.595 --> 00:23:46.765
I wrote the King James version, I think in my notes.

424
00:23:46.905 --> 00:23:47.125
But

425
00:23:52.605 --> 00:23:54.165
ES these says, pray then like this.

426
00:23:54.345 --> 00:23:56.125
Our father and heaven hall be your name.

427
00:23:56.155 --> 00:23:57.245
Your kingdom come,

428
00:23:59.955 --> 00:24:02.045
your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

429
00:24:02.795 --> 00:24:04.405
Give us a stay our daily bread

430
00:24:04.425 --> 00:24:08.165
and forgive our debts as we also have given our headers.

431
00:24:08.585 --> 00:24:10.725
Us not implementation, but deliverance from evil.

432
00:24:12.195 --> 00:24:14.725
Provide as the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.

433
00:24:17.925 --> 00:24:19.575
Amen. King James burden. Yeah.

434
00:24:21.475 --> 00:24:25.255
So pray according to God's will, praying with faith,

435
00:24:27.005 --> 00:24:28.615
praying to be obedient.

436
00:24:31.155 --> 00:24:32.455
Be something to pray for, something

437
00:24:32.455 --> 00:24:34.775
that you really weren't willing to be obedient to

438
00:24:34.775 --> 00:24:36.215
what God wants you to do.

439
00:24:37.435 --> 00:24:40.455
Um, Confession of sins. We've mentioned that.

440
00:24:40.455 --> 00:24:43.175
Praying for forgiving others. Humility.

441
00:24:44.795 --> 00:24:48.415
Um, Good pattern there.

442
00:24:48.875 --> 00:24:49.095
Um,

443
00:24:53.745 --> 00:24:58.135
think back, many of you, I believe I've heard a lot

444
00:24:58.135 --> 00:25:01.975
of prayers, worship services

445
00:25:02.555 --> 00:25:05.455
And Bible studies

446
00:25:05.595 --> 00:25:06.495
and things like that

447
00:25:11.365 --> 00:25:14.175
kind of prayers have been from your memory

448
00:25:15.205 --> 00:25:20.015
that have encouraged you think of any of those.

449
00:25:20.995 --> 00:25:23.215
Say that again. Prayer in your memory

450
00:25:23.475 --> 00:25:24.775
and your life experiences.

451
00:25:25.995 --> 00:25:29.295
You've heard many prayers, perhaps you said some,

452
00:25:29.295 --> 00:25:32.335
many prayers, but have there been any particular prayers

453
00:25:32.335 --> 00:25:36.135
that stand out in your memory, um, that have been

454
00:25:36.135 --> 00:25:38.295
of influenced to you or maybe a, a person

455
00:25:39.275 --> 00:25:40.655
who you've heard many prayers

456
00:25:40.655 --> 00:25:42.695
that have been an influence in your life?

457
00:25:46.655 --> 00:25:50.575
I think real here, here recently was just learning how

458
00:25:50.575 --> 00:25:54.895
to pray the Bible and, and giving adoration to God

459
00:25:55.035 --> 00:25:57.695
and recognize who he's and what he's done with him.

460
00:25:57.695 --> 00:26:00.135
Reading, praying through the Psalms. Right.

461
00:26:00.395 --> 00:26:02.415
And that's really a whole for me.

462
00:26:06.025 --> 00:26:09.215
Other thought. My mother every night at bedtime would pray

463
00:26:10.195 --> 00:26:12.855
and Lord bless you and keep you and make us patient.

464
00:26:13.355 --> 00:26:17.255
And I prayer for us as children for years and years, right.

465
00:26:17.565 --> 00:26:18.335
That stands out.

466
00:26:22.595 --> 00:26:25.775
My son said, thank you, God for the pizza

467
00:26:26.315 --> 00:26:27.315
Mm-hmm.

468
00:26:27.635 --> 00:26:30.295
Really resonated. Just simple.

469
00:26:30.985 --> 00:26:32.615
Right? It's

470
00:26:34.255 --> 00:26:35.255
Profound.

471
00:26:36.165 --> 00:26:36.775
Wonderful.

472
00:26:42.215 --> 00:26:44.925
I love when the, uh, there's occasion to pray

473
00:26:45.025 --> 00:26:47.885
for maybe some missionaries that are being sent out mm-hmm.

474
00:26:48.105 --> 00:26:51.245
For some occasion where we corporately pray

475
00:26:51.345 --> 00:26:54.085
and send those stand out

476
00:26:57.275 --> 00:27:00.405
Prayers when we stand around

477
00:27:01.805 --> 00:27:03.685
a deacon, stand around an elder

478
00:27:04.025 --> 00:27:06.045
or probation prayers, things like that.

479
00:27:07.365 --> 00:27:11.365
I, uh, my personal experience was I didn't grow up

480
00:27:12.225 --> 00:27:15.085
really going to church much at all.

481
00:27:15.505 --> 00:27:20.285
And, um, got into junior high

482
00:27:20.745 --> 00:27:21.925
and, uh, started going

483
00:27:21.925 --> 00:27:24.205
to church in Oklahoma City called the Baptist Temple.

484
00:27:24.745 --> 00:27:27.925
And, uh, It's Southern Baptist,

485
00:27:28.435 --> 00:27:29.685
very strongly Southern Baptist.

486
00:27:30.345 --> 00:27:33.005
And, uh, We would, uh,

487
00:27:35.095 --> 00:27:37.845
there was one gentleman that was called upon often

488
00:27:37.985 --> 00:27:40.605
by our pastor, uh, pray at the end

489
00:27:40.605 --> 00:27:43.285
of the Sunday Rather Divine.

490
00:27:45.265 --> 00:27:48.365
And, uh, brother had of divine was up to retired.

491
00:27:48.365 --> 00:27:52.605
Pastor had a voice, probably a church,

492
00:27:52.605 --> 00:27:53.805
about two or 300 maybe.

493
00:27:59.585 --> 00:28:01.405
And the thing that we would think about when

494
00:28:02.305 --> 00:28:04.085
our pastor would call on Brother Divine

495
00:28:04.145 --> 00:28:08.805
and pray as a seventh grader, how long is this prayer going

496
00:28:08.805 --> 00:28:13.085
to last Divine could

497
00:28:13.085 --> 00:28:14.325
pray some law for?

498
00:28:15.585 --> 00:28:19.045
And they were good prayers. That's a word.

499
00:28:20.105 --> 00:28:24.445
Uh, but I guess it, it took me a while to realize,

500
00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:29.325
Um, The importance of listening

501
00:28:29.325 --> 00:28:34.085
to brother prayers and how the Lord had gifted him.

502
00:28:34.585 --> 00:28:38.445
And so there are folks who are very gifted in

503
00:28:38.505 --> 00:28:40.805
how they pray, uh, aloud.

504
00:28:41.825 --> 00:28:46.405
Um, and so, um, that's a memory that I have to think about.

505
00:28:47.305 --> 00:28:50.405
Um, How about unanswered prayers?

506
00:28:51.225 --> 00:28:56.045
Um, there will always be unanswered prayers.

507
00:28:56.105 --> 00:28:58.445
Why? Because we do not know God's wise timing.

508
00:28:59.225 --> 00:29:01.885
We do not know, always know how to pray as we ought to.

509
00:29:04.185 --> 00:29:06.445
We do not always pray according to God's will.

510
00:29:09.405 --> 00:29:11.635
James four, three, you ask and do not receive

511
00:29:11.635 --> 00:29:15.675
because you have asked wrongly to spend it on your passions.

512
00:29:17.305 --> 00:29:21.805
And when you not always ask in faith, James one

513
00:29:21.805 --> 00:29:24.205
and six through eight says, but let him ask in faith

514
00:29:24.235 --> 00:29:27.845
with no doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave

515
00:29:27.985 --> 00:29:31.325
of the sea is driven and tossed by the wind.

516
00:29:32.345 --> 00:29:35.245
So that person must not suppose

517
00:29:35.275 --> 00:29:37.365
that he will receive anything from the Lord.

518
00:29:38.345 --> 00:29:41.365
He is a double-minded man, a stable normal players.

519
00:29:44.585 --> 00:29:47.045
So we sometimes jump ahead,

520
00:29:48.425 --> 00:29:53.245
Uh, Maybe sometimes think that we should,

521
00:29:53.385 --> 00:29:57.605
uh, our prayer should be answered more quickly than they

522
00:29:57.625 --> 00:30:01.305
are, or we not asking you the will.

523
00:30:04.885 --> 00:30:05.825
All things to think about.

524
00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:14.465
Sometimes it occurs that not the answer

525
00:30:19.485 --> 00:30:20.905
the way in which we expect.

526
00:30:23.245 --> 00:30:25.145
And that could be very, very difficult.

527
00:30:27.095 --> 00:30:31.185
Praying for the healing of Russell, praying for comfort,

528
00:30:35.495 --> 00:30:37.825
praying to sustain us in times of grief.

529
00:30:41.745 --> 00:30:45.585
I contend prayers serious. It's serious business.

530
00:30:47.375 --> 00:30:48.385
It's not to be avoid.

531
00:30:50.405 --> 00:30:52.785
One of the essential elements of prayer is

532
00:30:53.605 --> 00:30:55.025
praise and thanksgiving.

533
00:30:57.015 --> 00:30:58.065
Matthew six, nine.

534
00:30:58.065 --> 00:30:59.225
We've already shared this verse,

535
00:30:59.805 --> 00:31:02.025
but we want to emphasize our Father in heaven.

536
00:31:02.685 --> 00:31:07.145
How would be your name? So what does Hollywood mean?

537
00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:10.745
A good friend Aaron Ferguson has taught me

538
00:31:10.765 --> 00:31:13.585
to look in Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary

539
00:31:14.495 --> 00:31:18.665
because Haitz says, consecrated to a sacred use

540
00:31:19.485 --> 00:31:23.385
or to a religious exercise is to be reverenced.

541
00:31:25.665 --> 00:31:29.665
I looked up reverenced to be regarded with fear, mingled

542
00:31:29.665 --> 00:31:31.265
with respect and affection.

543
00:31:32.925 --> 00:31:37.865
We go approaching God, uh, with this feeling

544
00:31:37.925 --> 00:31:42.865
of it's a sacred exercise, a sacred opportunity

545
00:31:42.885 --> 00:31:44.225
to communicate with God

546
00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:47.825
and to do it in such a way that I, I'm somewhat fearful,

547
00:31:48.605 --> 00:31:50.905
but I I I'm, I'm saying it with respect,

548
00:31:51.085 --> 00:31:52.345
I'm saying it with affection.

549
00:31:53.855 --> 00:31:55.105
What a way to start our prayer.

550
00:32:00.805 --> 00:32:03.185
One of the first verses I memorized

551
00:32:03.195 --> 00:32:04.225
after being saved

552
00:32:04.245 --> 00:32:06.705
as a seventh grader at Falls Creek Baptist Assembly

553
00:32:07.605 --> 00:32:08.945
in Davis, Oklahoma,

554
00:32:10.715 --> 00:32:15.665
among about 5,000 other people, was Philippians four, six.

555
00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:17.865
It says, do not be anxious about anything,

556
00:32:18.485 --> 00:32:19.985
but in everything by prayer

557
00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:21.945
and supplication with thanksgiving.

558
00:32:22.885 --> 00:32:24.585
Let your request be made on the God

559
00:32:27.155 --> 00:32:28.895
by each director suggested it tonight.

560
00:32:28.995 --> 00:32:30.575
You memorized that first, Steve.

561
00:32:33.765 --> 00:32:36.495
It's been helpful. Colossians four, two,

562
00:32:37.375 --> 00:32:40.325
continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it

563
00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:42.405
with Thanksgiving, one

564
00:32:42.405 --> 00:32:46.565
of my top favorite words in the Bible, steadfast, along

565
00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:51.045
with ponder verse Thessalonians five 18.

566
00:32:51.205 --> 00:32:53.765
I meant to reference verses 16 through 18.

567
00:32:53.785 --> 00:32:56.165
But rejoice, always pray without ceasing.

568
00:32:56.165 --> 00:32:57.925
Give thanks in all circumstances.

569
00:32:58.665 --> 00:33:01.485
But this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.

570
00:33:04.985 --> 00:33:06.885
So do you have a regular time each day

571
00:33:09.985 --> 00:33:11.725
for private Bible reading and prayer?

572
00:33:14.885 --> 00:33:16.125
I want ask for a show of hands,

573
00:33:16.225 --> 00:33:19.285
but I'm guessing is this group of people

574
00:33:19.285 --> 00:33:21.845
that I'm looking at that you do.

575
00:33:24.065 --> 00:33:25.325
So I want to ask a question.

576
00:33:27.265 --> 00:33:29.765
How do you overcome distractions while you're playing?

577
00:33:31.565 --> 00:33:35.225
I'm looking for the answer. 'cause a

578
00:33:35.225 --> 00:33:36.505
wise group of folks here.

579
00:33:36.845 --> 00:33:40.665
So how do you overcome distractions? Late, late at night?

580
00:33:41.135 --> 00:33:44.825
Late late at night? Can you say that again?

581
00:33:45.245 --> 00:33:46.705
How do you overcome distractions?

582
00:33:47.285 --> 00:33:51.665
He said late, late at night. Other thoughts? Mine's early.

583
00:33:51.675 --> 00:33:53.585
Early in the morning. Early in the morning.

584
00:33:53.705 --> 00:33:55.065
I get up there, work two

585
00:33:55.085 --> 00:33:59.425
to four is late, late at night.

586
00:33:59.485 --> 00:34:03.345
So one person's late,

587
00:34:03.345 --> 00:34:05.105
late at night person.

588
00:34:05.575 --> 00:34:07.305
Earlier, early, early. Yeah.

589
00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:12.225
Do you find yourself sometimes being distracted?

590
00:34:13.565 --> 00:34:15.425
Our minds are racing a lot.

591
00:34:16.715 --> 00:34:19.185
Other things are going on in our lives. We think about,

592
00:34:20.325 --> 00:34:21.785
Um, One

593
00:34:21.785 --> 00:34:26.785
of our greatest distractions is this.

594
00:34:28.405 --> 00:34:31.545
Um, That's also one of our greatest, who

595
00:34:32.415 --> 00:34:35.865
Sometimes I use worshiping To pray worshiping. Okay.

596
00:34:36.345 --> 00:34:38.465
I use that as a Prayer. Right. Alright.

597
00:34:43.685 --> 00:34:46.385
You pray with others? Is

598
00:34:46.385 --> 00:34:49.385
that helpful? Yeah.

599
00:34:49.725 --> 00:34:51.865
We have a weekly group that meets on Mondays

600
00:34:52.045 --> 00:34:55.225
and, um, when we share, we're write it down

601
00:34:55.965 --> 00:34:58.305
and then when we pray for each other, it's written down.

602
00:34:58.375 --> 00:35:02.785
That helps me to focus. Mm-hmm. Because we

603
00:35:03.695 --> 00:35:05.105
Sitting On page. Right.

604
00:35:05.715 --> 00:35:09.025
Right. Yeah. I have to write things down.

605
00:35:10.365 --> 00:35:13.585
Um, Two or three different places perhaps.

606
00:35:14.425 --> 00:35:18.505
I remembered to pray for, uh, about Danny Lane, friend

607
00:35:18.505 --> 00:35:20.745
of mine lives morning Bible study this morning

608
00:35:21.415 --> 00:35:22.465
talking about, uh,

609
00:35:22.465 --> 00:35:24.585
he can had some eye surgery on, on Friday.

610
00:35:25.245 --> 00:35:27.625
So I wrote that down in my book

611
00:35:27.965 --> 00:35:31.145
and I put it in my calendar to remind me to pray for Danny

612
00:35:31.165 --> 00:35:32.985
and to check on him and see, uh,

613
00:35:33.125 --> 00:35:34.585
how he's doing about in the afternoon.

614
00:35:35.055 --> 00:35:36.865
Just, that's fairly simple,

615
00:35:37.225 --> 00:35:38.885
but if you don't write it down for me,

616
00:35:38.885 --> 00:35:41.085
if I don't write it down, I'll, I'll probably forget

617
00:35:41.085 --> 00:35:42.805
to forget it or have an opportunity to,

618
00:35:44.125 --> 00:35:47.725
I also find it helpful to write down distractions like

619
00:35:47.725 --> 00:35:50.605
that's to dos, come to mind, things that are important.

620
00:35:50.675 --> 00:35:53.085
Like, you know, that's sometimes distraction,

621
00:35:54.265 --> 00:35:56.725
but it helps me get it outta my head if I write it down.

622
00:35:57.435 --> 00:35:59.405
Okay. Stop.

623
00:35:59.475 --> 00:36:00.765
Flat it down and then we get back to,

624
00:36:00.765 --> 00:36:02.445
because it's, it's there whether I like it or not.

625
00:36:02.475 --> 00:36:05.525
Yeah. Get rid of it. Yeah. That's a good word.

626
00:36:08.065 --> 00:36:09.965
Do you ever have trouble wondering what to correct?

627
00:36:13.645 --> 00:36:15.685
I think that's where, what David was talking

628
00:36:15.755 --> 00:36:19.325
back scripture mm-hmm.

629
00:36:20.065 --> 00:36:21.245
And verse.

630
00:36:23.385 --> 00:36:26.605
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

631
00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:28.165
I, I wrote down the next thing I wrote down.

632
00:36:28.525 --> 00:36:29.965
I have the commend praying scripture.

633
00:36:32.985 --> 00:36:36.685
Um, You know, I've had the

634
00:36:37.835 --> 00:36:42.245
opportunity, um, privilege, responsibility, whatever,

635
00:36:42.985 --> 00:36:45.125
um, to pray, um,

636
00:36:46.505 --> 00:36:48.445
in the worship service. And,

637
00:36:49.425 --> 00:36:52.605
Um, The way that kind of works,

638
00:36:52.665 --> 00:36:54.365
the worship team will contact one of us

639
00:36:54.385 --> 00:36:56.405
and say, okay, this is your particular Sunday.

640
00:36:56.625 --> 00:36:59.245
And, um, so

641
00:37:01.435 --> 00:37:03.965
when I try to prepare for that, I always try

642
00:37:03.965 --> 00:37:08.285
to make sure I'm praying things I praying for,

643
00:37:08.285 --> 00:37:09.325
whether it's mission trips

644
00:37:09.425 --> 00:37:12.055
or whether it's praying for coordination of deacons

645
00:37:12.055 --> 00:37:15.175
or whatever it might be to pray a passage of scripture.

646
00:37:16.925 --> 00:37:20.605
Very, very helpful, uh, for me and important for me.

647
00:37:21.225 --> 00:37:23.725
And that's, that's listen to worship music,

648
00:37:23.725 --> 00:37:25.405
praying scripture, um,

649
00:37:25.715 --> 00:37:28.325
because that will cause so often will cause other things

650
00:37:28.525 --> 00:37:31.285
that come to mind that you need remember to pray.

651
00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:38.565
And, uh, and the

652
00:37:38.565 --> 00:37:41.005
thoughts about things that I haven't covered,

653
00:37:41.105 --> 00:37:44.005
but maybe come to mind.

654
00:37:44.285 --> 00:37:46.605
I, you know, yeah. Steve,

655
00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:50.365
I'm curious your thoughts, maybe other thoughts, like

656
00:37:50.365 --> 00:37:53.525
what does it actually look like to pray without ccc?

657
00:37:56.195 --> 00:37:59.645
Because we often, we often have a, a posture,

658
00:38:01.385 --> 00:38:03.885
but we can't maintain that posture 24 7.

659
00:38:04.035 --> 00:38:05.845
What, what, what does that look like?

660
00:38:08.635 --> 00:38:11.445
Well, I have a friend

661
00:38:11.585 --> 00:38:13.605
who I meet once a week named Kim Sw.

662
00:38:13.905 --> 00:38:15.285
He is awesome in prayer,

663
00:38:16.225 --> 00:38:19.325
and I am really bad at prayer, uh, really

664
00:38:20.035 --> 00:38:22.445
like a first prayer when comes to prayer.

665
00:38:23.865 --> 00:38:26.925
But he says, I'm not as bad as I think, I think he's lying

666
00:38:28.535 --> 00:38:30.845
About That, just trying to comfort his friend.

667
00:38:32.195 --> 00:38:36.165
Because when, when I do pray, it's kind

668
00:38:36.165 --> 00:38:38.805
of whispered conversational prayers all day.

669
00:38:39.865 --> 00:38:42.125
So I'll drive along and say, Lord, um,

670
00:38:42.385 --> 00:38:43.885
you this sound is beautiful.

671
00:38:43.905 --> 00:38:45.525
Oh, look out for that car. You know?

672
00:38:46.585 --> 00:38:48.805
And so much so that when I was at university

673
00:38:49.115 --> 00:38:50.685
that people see my lips move.

674
00:38:50.765 --> 00:38:52.565
I robbed a professor, I'm an idiot.

675
00:38:54.145 --> 00:38:58.325
Um, but maybe just conversational careers. Mm-hmm.

676
00:38:59.515 --> 00:39:00.885
It's my only hope right here.

677
00:39:02.445 --> 00:39:04.405
I always think of it too, is that we know

678
00:39:04.405 --> 00:39:05.965
that God is ever present.

679
00:39:06.905 --> 00:39:11.085
And so as I'm acknowledging and learning

680
00:39:11.225 --> 00:39:13.925
and like seeing him

681
00:39:14.865 --> 00:39:17.885
and recognizing him in every single thing,

682
00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:20.605
like every distraction, everything that I'm doing,

683
00:39:20.815 --> 00:39:24.485
everything that's going on, it's just an ongoing,

684
00:39:24.485 --> 00:39:27.125
because he's ever present with me.

685
00:39:27.845 --> 00:39:30.885
I can pray without Cece. Mm-hmm.

686
00:39:32.665 --> 00:39:35.765
Go back to what Dan said, it's a posture

687
00:39:36.025 --> 00:39:37.885
for sure of your heart.

688
00:39:40.345 --> 00:39:44.805
And I have this posture in my heart all day that is just

689
00:39:45.865 --> 00:39:48.045
really wanting to commune with him.

690
00:39:49.105 --> 00:39:51.925
And if I have things to do

691
00:39:52.105 --> 00:39:56.125
or everybody has things to do, that's okay.

692
00:39:56.985 --> 00:39:59.405
You still, you lose that posture.

693
00:40:00.585 --> 00:40:02.605
You just say, oh, I checked the box, I'm done.

694
00:40:02.635 --> 00:40:03.845
I'll see you tomorrow. Mm-hmm.

695
00:40:05.145 --> 00:40:07.765
Or do you just keep, you know, like Alan was saying,

696
00:40:08.245 --> 00:40:10.845
I just keep commuting with him all day long

697
00:40:11.065 --> 00:40:15.695
and Brenda all into the night until I'll just say,

698
00:40:17.885 --> 00:40:22.545
you know, when you go to bed now down to sleep, I, my

699
00:40:23.705 --> 00:40:26.225
probably awake.

700
00:40:27.345 --> 00:40:30.825
I think it's like just acknowledging his presence

701
00:40:30.855 --> 00:40:31.985
with us all the time.

702
00:40:31.985 --> 00:40:35.985
Mm-hmm. So it's like if I'm with Brad, if I'm with Brad,

703
00:40:36.145 --> 00:40:37.465
I can be in the car with him.

704
00:40:38.115 --> 00:40:39.465
We're not having a conversation,

705
00:40:39.485 --> 00:40:42.905
but I'm still, I mean, there's still a communication

706
00:40:42.925 --> 00:40:44.305
that's going on mm-hmm.

707
00:40:44.415 --> 00:40:46.905
Because I recognize that he's there with me.

708
00:40:46.905 --> 00:40:49.265
Sometimes it's a conversation,

709
00:40:49.265 --> 00:40:51.025
sometimes it's a deeper conversation.

710
00:40:53.335 --> 00:40:56.465
Just if the acknowledgement ever present

711
00:40:59.925 --> 00:41:04.385
Our relationship with, I want to

712
00:41:05.105 --> 00:41:07.105
continue the, the fellowship with God.

713
00:41:09.465 --> 00:41:10.465
Communication. Yeah.

714
00:41:11.975 --> 00:41:14.745
Well, one tactical thing that is not comprehensive,

715
00:41:14.925 --> 00:41:17.385
but it is, helps me in that direction.

716
00:41:17.735 --> 00:41:20.825
Just in the last few years, I catch myself when someone's

717
00:41:20.825 --> 00:41:22.065
sharing and they, and I,

718
00:41:22.205 --> 00:41:24.185
and I've had this natural response

719
00:41:24.205 --> 00:41:25.665
to say, I'll be praying for you.

720
00:41:25.665 --> 00:41:27.905
Mm-hmm. If I hear myself say that,

721
00:41:27.925 --> 00:41:30.585
or I'm about to say that, it starts to

722
00:41:30.585 --> 00:41:33.805
Trigger a That that triggers in my mind instead

723
00:41:33.805 --> 00:41:35.205
of saying, I'll be praying for you.

724
00:41:35.835 --> 00:41:38.925
What I'm trying to say now is, can I pray for you right now?

725
00:41:39.785 --> 00:41:41.685
And that's one way to pray without ceasing, is

726
00:41:41.685 --> 00:41:44.765
to pray in those moments and not just say, I'll be praying,

727
00:41:44.985 --> 00:41:47.605
but they're actually do it and then and there together.

728
00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:51.965
And it's, you know, when, when people have done that for me,

729
00:41:52.145 --> 00:41:54.645
it is definitely, uh, been impactful.

730
00:41:54.895 --> 00:41:56.045
Right. Pray together.

731
00:41:56.975 --> 00:41:58.645
Right. That's a good word.

732
00:41:58.795 --> 00:42:01.945
Just you're talking to someone,

733
00:42:02.015 --> 00:42:04.945
they're sharing something right now.

734
00:42:06.515 --> 00:42:11.225
Let's do it right now. Um, obviously situation where that,

735
00:42:13.005 --> 00:42:16.825
that's a really good, and I think we're all talking about

736
00:42:17.445 --> 00:42:20.705
an attitude, a lifestyle of prayer.

737
00:42:22.005 --> 00:42:26.665
Um, So that, that's to me is the idea

738
00:42:26.665 --> 00:42:28.065
of praying without ceasing.

739
00:42:28.125 --> 00:42:32.305
An attitude, a desire to desire to be aware

740
00:42:32.305 --> 00:42:34.225
of the Lord's presence in our lives at all times.

741
00:42:34.925 --> 00:42:37.425
Um, thank you Lord for this day.

742
00:42:37.515 --> 00:42:40.105
Thank you for reviewing the sunshine, this, all those types

743
00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:42.665
of things ever, ever present.

744
00:42:42.675 --> 00:42:44.025
Thank you for the relationship.

745
00:42:44.035 --> 00:42:46.305
Thank you for the day that I've had. Thank you for this.

746
00:42:46.305 --> 00:42:49.545
Thank you for that. Um, element, bit of praise, a lot of

747
00:42:49.545 --> 00:42:52.345
that, but also just to be willing to stop at certain times

748
00:42:52.485 --> 00:42:54.425
and have protect for people, um,

749
00:42:56.455 --> 00:42:58.345
into restaurants.

750
00:42:58.345 --> 00:43:01.065
People come contact in opportunities.

751
00:43:02.925 --> 00:43:07.145
People Often, they, they recognize it about you.

752
00:43:08.255 --> 00:43:10.665
They, they will often ask you to pray for you.

753
00:43:13.415 --> 00:43:16.385
Just to tag on to what, as Jennifer said, one

754
00:43:16.385 --> 00:43:20.065
of the things that sticks out in my mind all years

755
00:43:20.205 --> 00:43:23.425
of point out is

756
00:43:25.105 --> 00:43:28.785
probably when I go out with others to go out

757
00:43:28.785 --> 00:43:32.585
and see homeless and pray for people out the street, is

758
00:43:33.055 --> 00:43:37.465
that spirit of brokenness when I pray for them and they turn

759
00:43:37.465 --> 00:43:38.585
and say, I'm pray for you.

760
00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:42.785
And some most powerful prayers I've ever heard from homeless

761
00:43:42.785 --> 00:43:44.705
people that are really broken

762
00:43:45.765 --> 00:43:47.665
And, uh, They're praying for me.

763
00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:49.705
And that's very powerful.

764
00:43:50.085 --> 00:43:55.025
So can I have one quick testimony? Yeah. Good.

765
00:43:55.185 --> 00:43:56.545
I just got a voice message.

766
00:43:56.885 --> 00:43:59.225
It wasn't voice message on my phone, a text message.

767
00:43:59.405 --> 00:44:01.705
It was a voice one from a gentleman I

768
00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:02.825
met about two weeks ago.

769
00:44:03.405 --> 00:44:04.465
And so he didn't text me.

770
00:44:04.465 --> 00:44:05.825
He sent me the today

771
00:44:05.845 --> 00:44:07.505
and I said, Hey Robert, um,

772
00:44:07.805 --> 00:44:09.145
so if I meet you a few weeks ago,

773
00:44:09.665 --> 00:44:10.665
I just thinking about you today.

774
00:44:10.825 --> 00:44:11.905
I just want to pray for you.

775
00:44:12.285 --> 00:44:14.105
And so he just prayed right then and there

776
00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:18.825
and he sent me the recorded prayer like right now.

777
00:44:19.135 --> 00:44:22.505
Yeah, that was a big surprise. And um, so

778
00:44:23.285 --> 00:44:24.285
That's a good example.

779
00:44:24.565 --> 00:44:28.945
One example. Well, thank you.

780
00:44:28.985 --> 00:44:30.945
I really appreciate the discussion and your thoughts.

781
00:44:31.345 --> 00:44:34.485
Um, we could spend many sessions on prayer.

782
00:44:35.105 --> 00:44:39.445
In fact, uh, seems like I involved in a class nights.

783
00:44:39.505 --> 00:44:42.125
We talk about six weeks on prayer, if I remember right.

784
00:44:43.545 --> 00:44:46.325
Um, let's move on.

785
00:44:48.225 --> 00:44:51.325
But first Hebrews chapter 4, 14 16.

786
00:44:51.385 --> 00:44:54.045
It says, since then, we have a great high priest

787
00:44:54.105 --> 00:44:57.485
who has past through the heavens, Jesus the son of God,

788
00:44:57.545 --> 00:44:59.205
let us fall past our confession.

789
00:44:59.825 --> 00:45:01.925
But we do not have a high priest who is unable

790
00:45:01.925 --> 00:45:03.325
to sympathize with our weaknesses.

791
00:45:04.025 --> 00:45:06.885
For one who in every respect, who has been tempted

792
00:45:06.885 --> 00:45:09.205
as we are yet without sin.

793
00:45:09.305 --> 00:45:12.605
Let us then with confidence drawn near to the throne

794
00:45:12.605 --> 00:45:14.325
of grace that we may receive mercy

795
00:45:14.585 --> 00:45:16.725
and find grace to help die of need.

796
00:45:17.905 --> 00:45:20.085
So Hebrews four, 14th 16.

797
00:45:21.875 --> 00:45:24.925
From the second part of our, uh, time, I is

798
00:45:28.075 --> 00:45:31.445
dealing with angels and satan and demons.

799
00:45:32.235 --> 00:45:34.125
I'll turn it over here to Jacob here in a minute.

800
00:45:34.225 --> 00:45:38.005
But, uh, uh, again, the timing, uh,

801
00:45:39.415 --> 00:45:41.605
especially on the heart regarding the second of demons.

802
00:45:41.605 --> 00:45:43.365
And then we have Halloween in two days

803
00:45:43.585 --> 00:45:47.285
and which is not a favorite day of mine,

804
00:45:47.305 --> 00:45:49.045
but anyway, it's my own personal problem.

805
00:45:49.465 --> 00:45:52.645
Um, angels are defined as angels are created

806
00:45:53.365 --> 00:45:56.005
spiritual beings with moral judgment and high intelligence,

807
00:45:56.505 --> 00:45:57.805
but without physical bodies.

808
00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:03.485
Um, spiritual beings is another name, sons

809
00:46:03.485 --> 00:46:07.445
of God, the holy ones ministering, spirits, watchers,

810
00:46:08.355 --> 00:46:11.085
thrones, dominions, rulers, authorities and power.

811
00:46:12.055 --> 00:46:14.045
There are other kinds of heavenly beings.

812
00:46:14.345 --> 00:46:18.965
Um, what is mentioned is the Cherin, uh, mentioned

813
00:46:19.025 --> 00:46:21.285
as guarding the entrance of the Garden

814
00:46:21.285 --> 00:46:23.245
of Eden in Genesis 3 24.

815
00:46:24.635 --> 00:46:26.685
Also two golden figures of Cherin

816
00:46:26.685 --> 00:46:28.925
with their wing stretched over the Ark of the Covenant.

817
00:46:29.705 --> 00:46:34.445
In Exodus chapter 25, the Lord is instructing Moses,

818
00:46:34.515 --> 00:46:35.805
that the people of Israel were

819
00:46:35.805 --> 00:46:37.525
to make him a sanctuary at tabernacle

820
00:46:38.025 --> 00:46:40.125
and the furniture to be contained therein.

821
00:46:40.125 --> 00:46:43.565
And he gave very specific instructions regarding the arc

822
00:46:43.565 --> 00:46:46.925
of the covenant and for you Raiders of the lost arc fans.

823
00:46:47.025 --> 00:46:50.365
You might remember, I might have seen the movie's idea of

824
00:46:50.365 --> 00:46:51.365
what the arc looks like,

825
00:46:53.745 --> 00:46:56.605
but specifically beginning in verse 17 of chapter 25,

826
00:46:56.665 --> 00:46:59.125
it says, Lord's instructing that says,

827
00:46:59.125 --> 00:47:01.285
you shall make a mercy seat of pure gold.

828
00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:05.005
Two cubits and a half shall be its length and a cubit

829
00:47:05.005 --> 00:47:06.005
and a half its bread.

830
00:47:06.505 --> 00:47:09.885
And you shall make two cher him of gold of hammered work.

831
00:47:09.985 --> 00:47:12.765
So you make them on the two ends of the mercy seat,

832
00:47:12.765 --> 00:47:14.805
you make one cher him, one on the one end

833
00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:18.005
and one cher him on the other end of one piece

834
00:47:18.145 --> 00:47:21.965
for the mercy seat show, you make the chair on its two ends.

835
00:47:22.585 --> 00:47:25.605
The cherin shall spread out their wings, their faces, one

836
00:47:25.605 --> 00:47:27.645
to another toward the mercy seat.

837
00:47:27.675 --> 00:47:29.485
Show the faces of the chair of Ofd

838
00:47:29.985 --> 00:47:32.725
and you shall put the mercy seat on the top of the ark.

839
00:47:32.945 --> 00:47:34.965
And in the ark you shall put the testimony

840
00:47:34.965 --> 00:47:36.685
that I shall give you there.

841
00:47:36.795 --> 00:47:39.645
I'll meet with you. And from above the mercy seat from

842
00:47:39.645 --> 00:47:42.085
between the two Cher of him that are on the ark

843
00:47:42.085 --> 00:47:44.165
of the testimony, I'll speak with you about all

844
00:47:44.165 --> 00:47:46.485
that I will give you and commandment

845
00:47:46.485 --> 00:47:47.765
for the people of Israel.

846
00:47:48.545 --> 00:47:50.805
So surely with that precise description,

847
00:47:51.225 --> 00:47:52.685
we can see the importance of

848
00:47:52.785 --> 00:47:54.885
and the significance of the Chairman, the Lord

849
00:47:55.755 --> 00:47:58.935
at least describe in Exodus chapter 25,

850
00:47:59.745 --> 00:48:03.055
Sarah F mentioned to only in Isaiah six, chapter six,

851
00:48:03.055 --> 00:48:06.295
verse two, seven, Isaiah's vision in the Lord.

852
00:48:06.875 --> 00:48:07.895
He saw the seraphim

853
00:48:07.895 --> 00:48:09.855
and he heard them proclaiming, holy, holy,

854
00:48:09.925 --> 00:48:11.215
holy is the Lord of host.

855
00:48:11.915 --> 00:48:13.655
The whole earth was full of his glory.

856
00:48:14.195 --> 00:48:16.215
And then one of the seraphim flew to Isaiah

857
00:48:16.315 --> 00:48:17.975
and touched a burning cold in his mouth

858
00:48:18.435 --> 00:48:21.655
and said, said, behold, this has touched your lips.

859
00:48:22.205 --> 00:48:24.055
Your guilt is taken away

860
00:48:24.155 --> 00:48:28.155
and your sin is a con for the term.

861
00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:30.955
Living creatures was mentioned in Ezekiel

862
00:48:30.955 --> 00:48:33.395
and Revelation as other kinds of heavenly being.

863
00:48:34.065 --> 00:48:36.755
They worship God continually day and night.

864
00:48:36.755 --> 00:48:39.035
They never cease to say Holy, holy,

865
00:48:39.035 --> 00:48:43.555
holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is to come.

866
00:48:43.645 --> 00:48:44.955
Revelation four A.

867
00:48:46.295 --> 00:48:49.715
So I think, uh, Jacob's gonna come

868
00:48:49.715 --> 00:48:51.835
and talk a little bit about, I just wanna mention quickly,

869
00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:55.995
uh, in guardian angels in general, uh,

870
00:48:56.775 --> 00:48:59.755
angels protect us, um, guard us.

871
00:48:59.755 --> 00:49:02.595
But do we have specific individual guardian angels?

872
00:49:03.445 --> 00:49:07.515
Don't think so. Uh, I have a close friend who worked for me

873
00:49:07.515 --> 00:49:10.875
for many years who very much believed in guardian angels.

874
00:49:11.495 --> 00:49:13.955
And every Christmas she would give angels

875
00:49:13.955 --> 00:49:15.955
to my daughters as gifts.

876
00:49:16.695 --> 00:49:20.235
Um, so angels show the greatness

877
00:49:20.235 --> 00:49:22.035
of God's love and for us.

878
00:49:22.895 --> 00:49:27.275
Um, what do angels have to do with us today?

879
00:49:27.655 --> 00:49:32.595
Um, I'll let Jacob share about some

880
00:49:32.595 --> 00:49:35.515
of those things, but, uh, he also should be some caution.

881
00:49:36.335 --> 00:49:39.315
And then Jacob also talk about demons. Jacob over

882
00:49:42.535 --> 00:49:43.535
To be finished.

883
00:49:44.175 --> 00:49:46.035
You got 22 minutes

884
00:49:51.935 --> 00:49:52.935
Set up here. Yeah.

885
00:49:52.935 --> 00:49:55.115
So it's a privilege to get to talk to you all night.

886
00:49:55.775 --> 00:49:57.555
Uh, we'll say it's a little bit too minute though.

887
00:49:57.555 --> 00:49:59.795
When I saw the schedule, I was like, right, there's indeed.

888
00:50:01.495 --> 00:50:03.875
Um, do I need the,

889
00:50:11.665 --> 00:50:11.955
Okay.

890
00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:13.835
Um, so yeah, my name's Jacob Stan.

891
00:50:14.215 --> 00:50:15.715
Um, I said, it's a privilege.

892
00:50:15.715 --> 00:50:17.155
I know some of y'all, some of y'all I don't know.

893
00:50:17.615 --> 00:50:20.195
Um, um, so just one like quick fun fact about

894
00:50:20.195 --> 00:50:21.395
me, love Christmas time.

895
00:50:21.975 --> 00:50:24.515
Um, love everything around it obviously brings our savior.

896
00:50:25.015 --> 00:50:26.875
Um, but I also just love

897
00:50:26.965 --> 00:50:28.165
everything that goes around with it.

898
00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:31.285
I love the lights. Uh, I love the music.

899
00:50:31.945 --> 00:50:33.605
Um, I love the movies

900
00:50:34.385 --> 00:50:35.485
and you know, I have like

901
00:50:35.485 --> 00:50:36.805
traditions, things like to go every year.

902
00:50:36.985 --> 00:50:38.325
One of those is watch certain movies.

903
00:50:39.065 --> 00:50:42.045
And for me, one my favorite movies is it's a wonderful Life.

904
00:50:42.705 --> 00:50:44.285
And so I couldn't help but to think about it

905
00:50:44.285 --> 00:50:46.205
because we talk about angels and demons

906
00:50:46.985 --> 00:50:50.765
and, you know, so much of our, of our, maybe our ideas

907
00:50:50.945 --> 00:50:54.965
of angels and demons can really be influenced by culture,

908
00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:57.205
by movies, TV shows and stuff like that.

909
00:50:57.625 --> 00:50:59.525
So I thought maybe we could do a little better critique

910
00:50:59.525 --> 00:51:01.485
of the movie and see

911
00:51:01.485 --> 00:51:03.965
how accurately it portrays angels for us.

912
00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:06.005
So if you're not familiar with it,

913
00:51:06.005 --> 00:51:07.365
there's a guy's named George Bailey,

914
00:51:07.825 --> 00:51:10.605
and he has a guardian angel named Clarence that comes back

915
00:51:10.705 --> 00:51:12.325
to, to visit him and kind

916
00:51:12.325 --> 00:51:13.725
of helps him see the importance of his life.

917
00:51:14.025 --> 00:51:15.085
So what are some things we learned?

918
00:51:15.115 --> 00:51:17.885
Well, in the movie, they have guardian angels.

919
00:51:17.915 --> 00:51:19.485
They're sent to watch one person

920
00:51:19.705 --> 00:51:20.805
as their, you know, as their guardian.

921
00:51:20.805 --> 00:51:24.285
Angel angels are kind of clumsy, right?

922
00:51:24.395 --> 00:51:26.205
They are guides and they're sent to like,

923
00:51:26.205 --> 00:51:27.405
change their perspective on life.

924
00:51:28.065 --> 00:51:30.365
Uh, it seems like there's kind of a sanctification process

925
00:51:30.465 --> 00:51:31.645
for angels in the movies.

926
00:51:32.305 --> 00:51:35.285
And then of course, the most important fact about angels in

927
00:51:35.285 --> 00:51:37.125
the movie is every time a bell rings

928
00:51:37.125 --> 00:51:38.165
and angel gets your wings.

929
00:51:40.145 --> 00:51:41.805
So I kind of say all that jokingly,

930
00:51:41.805 --> 00:51:44.085
but you know, if we do get our understanding of angel

931
00:51:44.085 --> 00:51:47.085
and demons from movies, uh, we just left

932
00:51:47.085 --> 00:51:48.365
with false theology.

933
00:51:48.905 --> 00:51:50.045
So what do we learn about 'em?

934
00:51:50.045 --> 00:51:51.125
Well, we just look at scripture.

935
00:51:51.145 --> 00:51:54.005
And so as, as Protestants, you know, we affirm so

936
00:51:54.005 --> 00:51:57.565
of fide the scripture is the sole source of, you know,

937
00:51:57.565 --> 00:52:00.645
divine revelation, the only inspired and fallible final

938
00:52:01.185 --> 00:52:03.325
and authoritative norm of faith and practice.

939
00:52:03.385 --> 00:52:05.085
So this includes our view on angels.

940
00:52:05.465 --> 00:52:09.205
So I'm gonna ask a few questions about angels and humans

941
00:52:09.425 --> 00:52:10.925
and we'll see what scripture says about them.

942
00:52:11.105 --> 00:52:13.845
So, and we've gotta start off first. So do angels exist?

943
00:52:13.895 --> 00:52:16.485
Where did they come from? So yes, angels do exist

944
00:52:16.505 --> 00:52:18.365
and God is the one created them.

945
00:52:19.025 --> 00:52:22.125
Uh, and the scripture for this is Nehemiah nine, six.

946
00:52:22.225 --> 00:52:24.085
It says, you are the Lord.

947
00:52:24.305 --> 00:52:27.205
You alone, you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens

948
00:52:27.205 --> 00:52:28.925
with all their hosts, the earth

949
00:52:28.925 --> 00:52:31.205
and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them.

950
00:52:31.745 --> 00:52:33.245
You preserve all of them, and the host

951
00:52:33.265 --> 00:52:34.405
of heaven worshiped you.

952
00:52:34.825 --> 00:52:37.085
So the host God created them,

953
00:52:37.385 --> 00:52:40.005
and these, the hosts, the angels, they also worship God.

954
00:52:40.705 --> 00:52:41.925
And then there's plenty of

955
00:52:41.985 --> 00:52:44.205
of accounts in the Bible, a few that come to mind.

956
00:52:44.305 --> 00:52:47.845
Two angels come to lie, uh, in Sodom to save his family.

957
00:52:48.575 --> 00:52:50.405
Angel Gabriel announces the birth of Jesus

958
00:52:50.585 --> 00:52:52.445
to Mary, uh, and Luke.

959
00:52:52.545 --> 00:52:56.085
And then, uh, an angel helps Peter escaped from

960
00:52:56.085 --> 00:52:57.285
prison in Acts 12.

961
00:52:58.185 --> 00:53:00.765
And then the guardian angel question from the movie, right?

962
00:53:00.985 --> 00:53:03.245
So we can look at the Bible

963
00:53:03.265 --> 00:53:06.765
and see that God does send angels for our protection.

964
00:53:07.585 --> 00:53:11.245
So Psalm 9, 1 11 says that he will command his angels

965
00:53:11.695 --> 00:53:14.805
concerning you to guard you in all your ways.

966
00:53:15.545 --> 00:53:17.805
So God does enable us to guard us in our ways.

967
00:53:18.665 --> 00:53:21.445
Um, so one question that I have for y'all, thinking

968
00:53:21.445 --> 00:53:24.485
through the Bible, what are some examples in the Bible

969
00:53:24.665 --> 00:53:28.765
of stories where an angel is sentenced to protect someone

970
00:53:35.385 --> 00:53:36.405
Lot in his family?

971
00:53:39.805 --> 00:53:44.285
14, he would accept, protect that

972
00:53:45.065 --> 00:53:46.325
the plane too, you

973
00:53:46.325 --> 00:53:49.285
Talk, talking about when it Detective Moses' body

974
00:53:50.145 --> 00:53:51.145
No, no. She's

975
00:53:51.145 --> 00:53:52.645
talking about Daniel. Yeah.

976
00:53:53.385 --> 00:53:57.365
Was, uh, came to explain history. That's it. Yeah.

977
00:53:57.365 --> 00:54:00.885
Thank you. And

978
00:54:00.885 --> 00:54:04.365
Angel, Joe, like an entire harmony series for Israel.

979
00:54:08.035 --> 00:54:10.805
Okay, what else? Daniel? The lives

980
00:54:10.915 --> 00:54:14.805
Been Delivered

981
00:54:14.805 --> 00:54:17.005
News about John Baptist. Jesus

982
00:54:17.675 --> 00:54:18.675
Anymore?

983
00:54:21.025 --> 00:54:23.405
No. Okay.

984
00:54:23.755 --> 00:54:24.205
He's hungry.

985
00:54:30.495 --> 00:54:34.165
Sue's sued. Mary's scared. Goodbye.

986
00:54:34.505 --> 00:54:37.125
So, and,

987
00:54:37.145 --> 00:54:41.205
and you know, made it that this was, this was something

988
00:54:41.205 --> 00:54:44.765
that God home was divine AEs.

989
00:54:45.745 --> 00:54:48.045
She would be mother inside.

990
00:54:49.225 --> 00:54:52.685
So I guess sharing that intelligence, that information

991
00:54:53.505 --> 00:54:57.725
of god's and confirming and also comfort

992
00:55:02.675 --> 00:55:05.925
When came to the tomb and Jesus' body wasn't there

993
00:55:05.925 --> 00:55:06.885
And the angel said,

994
00:55:13.505 --> 00:55:14.505
Is that what you're asking?

995
00:55:14.515 --> 00:55:14.805
Sure.

996
00:55:19.985 --> 00:55:20.985
That's,

997
00:55:26.625 --> 00:55:28.405
So one more here that I wrote down was,

998
00:55:28.505 --> 00:55:30.565
uh, Elisha's eyes are open.

999
00:55:30.625 --> 00:55:31.885
He sees the mountains filled with horses

1000
00:55:31.905 --> 00:55:33.405
and Sherry's a fire all around him.

1001
00:55:34.085 --> 00:55:35.535
Does someone else have one over here?

1002
00:55:37.055 --> 00:55:40.135
I was gonna say lums don't Yeah,

1003
00:55:40.635 --> 00:55:41.975
but that, that was helpful for

1004
00:55:42.245 --> 00:55:43.975
Yeah. I'm not sure if that's what you

1005
00:55:43.975 --> 00:55:44.975
Mean. Sure.

1006
00:55:44.975 --> 00:55:46.655
Yeah.

1007
00:55:46.655 --> 00:55:48.975
There's certainly a lot more examples just of angels just,

1008
00:55:48.975 --> 00:55:50.935
just kind of beyond, um, you know,

1009
00:55:50.965 --> 00:55:52.615
like protecting people in the Bible.

1010
00:55:53.275 --> 00:55:57.095
Um, so in, in the book, so just thinking about the idea

1011
00:55:57.095 --> 00:55:59.335
of do we have individual guardian angels?

1012
00:55:59.635 --> 00:56:01.335
So Gruden uses a sports analogy.

1013
00:56:01.915 --> 00:56:04.935
So he says, we should think that angels play zone defense

1014
00:56:05.475 --> 00:56:07.015
and not man to man defense.

1015
00:56:07.635 --> 00:56:09.495
Um, and so, you know, he says

1016
00:56:09.495 --> 00:56:12.295
that there's no convincing scriptural support, um,

1017
00:56:12.295 --> 00:56:13.615
for individual guardian angels,

1018
00:56:13.615 --> 00:56:17.055
but rather angels in general are protecting God's people.

1019
00:56:18.315 --> 00:56:20.895
And then maybe just the last question to ask about angels.

1020
00:56:21.445 --> 00:56:23.445
What, what is the purpose of angels?

1021
00:56:24.785 --> 00:56:26.485
And so what we see is that humans

1022
00:56:26.505 --> 00:56:28.125
and angels are the only moral,

1023
00:56:28.385 --> 00:56:30.365
highly intelligent creatures God has made.

1024
00:56:31.505 --> 00:56:33.645
And one, one purpose, there was many

1025
00:56:33.645 --> 00:56:35.725
of the group listed out, but one person, uh, purpose,

1026
00:56:35.865 --> 00:56:39.725
the one that that um, I find a lot of comfort in is

1027
00:56:40.465 --> 00:56:41.965
the angels show the greatness

1028
00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:43.765
of God's love and planning for us.

1029
00:56:45.185 --> 00:56:48.125
So in two Peter two, four,

1030
00:56:48.635 --> 00:56:50.445
he's talking about angels, angels sin.

1031
00:56:51.105 --> 00:56:53.005
It says, for God did not spare angels.

1032
00:56:53.005 --> 00:56:55.245
When they sinned, we cast them into hell

1033
00:56:55.665 --> 00:56:57.485
and committed them to change of gloomy darkness

1034
00:56:57.485 --> 00:56:58.765
to be kept until judgment.

1035
00:56:59.585 --> 00:57:03.205
So the sin, the God did not save them.

1036
00:57:04.545 --> 00:57:05.765
He decided to save none of them.

1037
00:57:05.865 --> 00:57:08.645
And that was perfectly just for God to do.

1038
00:57:10.225 --> 00:57:13.765
As humans, we have sin and we, we have turned from God,

1039
00:57:14.425 --> 00:57:17.445
but God gives us grace.

1040
00:57:18.825 --> 00:57:20.725
He does decide to save some of us.

1041
00:57:21.745 --> 00:57:25.205
And he says in Revelation five, nine, not only some of us,

1042
00:57:25.305 --> 00:57:28.805
but a great multitude whom no man can number from every

1043
00:57:28.805 --> 00:57:30.685
tribe and language and people and nation.

1044
00:57:32.185 --> 00:57:36.805
So as you think about the contrast between angels, sinning

1045
00:57:37.065 --> 00:57:40.965
and God, choosing not to save them and us sin

1046
00:57:41.545 --> 00:57:42.885
and God choosing to save us.

1047
00:57:44.025 --> 00:57:47.165
So just a question that I pose to y'all is what does

1048
00:57:47.165 --> 00:57:49.605
that teach you about God's grace

1049
00:57:55.785 --> 00:57:56.785
And why?

1050
00:57:57.915 --> 00:57:58.915
Sure.

1051
00:58:10.365 --> 00:58:13.045
I think it would be important to point out that yeah,

1052
00:58:13.385 --> 00:58:17.605
you made two spirit highly intelligent spiritual beings,

1053
00:58:18.425 --> 00:58:21.365
but only one of those to be creating his image.

1054
00:58:23.145 --> 00:58:25.085
And that's why he can redeem this.

1055
00:58:29.395 --> 00:58:30.445
That was what I was gonna say.

1056
00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:38.965
It reminds me of the juxtaposition inal made.

1057
00:58:38.995 --> 00:58:41.445
What is man that you're mindful of him,

1058
00:58:41.505 --> 00:58:42.925
the son of man, that you care for him.

1059
00:58:43.275 --> 00:58:45.445
Yeah, you've made them a little lower than the heavenly

1060
00:58:45.445 --> 00:58:47.525
beings, but you crown him with glory and honor.

1061
00:58:48.545 --> 00:58:51.925
So the angels, when they interact with humans, humans,

1062
00:58:51.925 --> 00:58:53.245
humans are usually terrified,

1063
00:58:54.505 --> 00:58:58.045
but yet God extended his grace toward, toward us.

1064
00:58:58.115 --> 00:58:59.685
It's, it's incredible.

1065
00:59:00.275 --> 00:59:02.285
What verse was there I thought was Psalm eight,

1066
00:59:03.095 --> 00:59:04.405
Psalm eight, five

1067
00:59:07.025 --> 00:59:08.245
in Hebrews two.

1068
00:59:11.075 --> 00:59:12.725
What else? Anybody else add anything on that?

1069
00:59:13.475 --> 00:59:17.725
Well, to tie into what he's saying, that that that idea

1070
00:59:17.725 --> 00:59:20.125
that angles are wonderful, ambassador of God,

1071
00:59:22.115 --> 00:59:25.925
That resident yet we're created in his image,

1072
00:59:26.115 --> 00:59:28.645
whereas angles are not directly created in.

1073
00:59:32.635 --> 00:59:34.605
Okay, so let's move on to talking about demons.

1074
00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:38.165
Um, see this list, he has a very quote on this.

1075
00:59:38.185 --> 00:59:40.205
He says there's two equal opposite hes into

1076
00:59:40.205 --> 00:59:41.325
which our race can fall about.

1077
00:59:41.325 --> 00:59:44.365
The devils one is the disbelief in their existence.

1078
00:59:44.905 --> 00:59:47.005
The other is to believe and to feel an excessive

1079
00:59:47.005 --> 00:59:48.605
and unhealthy interest in them.

1080
00:59:49.345 --> 00:59:50.965
You know, our culture is very, um,

1081
00:59:51.035 --> 00:59:53.045
it's very naturalistic worldview.

1082
00:59:53.065 --> 00:59:55.125
So it's really, Hey, what can you see touch here?

1083
00:59:55.665 --> 00:59:57.325
So even just talking about angels

1084
00:59:57.325 --> 00:59:59.805
and humans, um, you know, it's not something

1085
00:59:59.805 --> 01:00:02.645
that people want to admit or believe in, right?

1086
01:00:03.515 --> 01:00:05.245
What a scripture say. Do demons exist?

1087
01:00:05.385 --> 01:00:07.525
Yes, God created the world.

1088
01:00:08.065 --> 01:00:09.845
He looked at it and said everything was good.

1089
01:00:10.635 --> 01:00:12.165
Then we fast forward to Genesis three

1090
01:00:12.745 --> 01:00:16.205
and has to have been something that has happened, some sort

1091
01:00:16.205 --> 01:00:17.605
of rebelled angelic world

1092
01:00:17.605 --> 01:00:19.765
because now we're introduced to this new person, Satan,

1093
01:00:20.385 --> 01:00:22.085
um, is not good.

1094
01:00:23.665 --> 01:00:26.885
And then Ephesians six 12 tells us we do not wrestle against

1095
01:00:26.885 --> 01:00:28.285
flesh and blood, but against the

1096
01:00:28.285 --> 01:00:29.605
rulers, against the authorities.

1097
01:00:29.605 --> 01:00:32.565
The cosmic powers over this present darkness against the

1098
01:00:32.805 --> 01:00:36.125
spiritual forces of evil in the heaven many places.

1099
01:00:39.185 --> 01:00:41.125
And then another question to ask,

1100
01:00:41.665 --> 01:00:44.525
can a believer be possessed by a demon?

1101
01:00:45.705 --> 01:00:47.365
We talk about, do we have guardian angels?

1102
01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:49.205
What about who be possessed by demon?

1103
01:00:50.345 --> 01:00:52.165
So, uh, ome, he distinguishes

1104
01:00:52.165 --> 01:00:54.045
between possession and influence.

1105
01:00:54.745 --> 01:00:58.005
So demon possession is often understood, um, to mean

1106
01:00:58.005 --> 01:01:01.805
that a person is unable to resist the influence of a demon.

1107
01:01:02.465 --> 01:01:05.845
And so this idea of possession is not a biblical one.

1108
01:01:06.825 --> 01:01:08.045
So scripture guarantees that

1109
01:01:08.045 --> 01:01:09.845
that sin shall dominion over us since

1110
01:01:09.845 --> 01:01:10.965
we've been raised with Christ.

1111
01:01:12.305 --> 01:01:13.325
But we do look at scripture.

1112
01:01:13.345 --> 01:01:15.485
We can say that demons do have influence

1113
01:01:16.075 --> 01:01:18.565
over people even and over believers.

1114
01:01:19.225 --> 01:01:21.245
Um, and it's found in scripture, uh,

1115
01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:22.525
varying degrees of influence.

1116
01:01:22.905 --> 01:01:25.845
So for example, Luke 13, um, a woman has said

1117
01:01:25.845 --> 01:01:27.605
to have a disabling spirit and she was bound

1118
01:01:27.605 --> 01:01:28.885
by Satan for 18 years.

1119
01:01:30.945 --> 01:01:33.365
And then last, what, what is our authority

1120
01:01:33.425 --> 01:01:34.725
as believers over demons?

1121
01:01:35.265 --> 01:01:37.085
So Jesus gives us disciples power

1122
01:01:37.085 --> 01:01:38.405
and authority over all demons.

1123
01:01:38.585 --> 01:01:41.005
In Luke nine, one and his authority,

1124
01:01:41.185 --> 01:01:43.565
it continues to all believers.

1125
01:01:43.675 --> 01:01:45.205
It's evidenced by Paul using his

1126
01:01:45.765 --> 01:01:47.285
spiritual authority over demons and acts.

1127
01:01:48.345 --> 01:01:50.165
And then James and Peter tell other readers

1128
01:01:50.435 --> 01:01:52.525
that they have authority and power to resist the devil

1129
01:01:52.525 --> 01:01:53.565
and he will free from you.

1130
01:01:54.035 --> 01:01:56.125
This goes back to can we be possessed or,

1131
01:01:56.385 --> 01:01:57.965
or can we be influenced by demons?

1132
01:01:58.195 --> 01:02:00.925
Well, it tells us we resist the devil.

1133
01:02:01.145 --> 01:02:03.665
He will free from you. So why do we

1134
01:02:03.665 --> 01:02:04.785
have authority over demons?

1135
01:02:06.205 --> 01:02:10.345
The finish work of Jesus on the cross is our authority

1136
01:02:10.405 --> 01:02:12.985
as believers over demons at the cross.

1137
01:02:13.845 --> 01:02:15.425
God dis on the rulers and authorities

1138
01:02:15.425 --> 01:02:19.025
and put them to open chain by trumping over them in here.

1139
01:02:20.665 --> 01:02:21.805
And this is my favorite one.

1140
01:02:21.805 --> 01:02:24.565
From there it says lastly, our confidence

1141
01:02:24.565 --> 01:02:25.685
and our authority comes through our

1142
01:02:25.685 --> 01:02:27.645
status as God's children.

1143
01:02:28.635 --> 01:02:32.165
When demons, when they attempt to influence us, they must go

1144
01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:33.165
through our Heavenly Father.

1145
01:02:33.955 --> 01:02:36.285
It's that, oh, you know, my dad can be up, your dad pain.

1146
01:02:36.715 --> 01:02:38.285
It's like, well, if you wanna come at me,

1147
01:02:38.585 --> 01:02:40.005
you gotta go through my father first.

1148
01:02:40.505 --> 01:02:42.925
So that can give us a lot of confidence over the meetings.

1149
01:02:43.465 --> 01:02:47.725
So my last question just for y'all is kind of goes back to

1150
01:02:47.725 --> 01:02:51.885
that CS Lewis quote, how do we maintain a healthy,

1151
01:02:52.165 --> 01:02:55.325
balanced view of angels and demons without falling into

1152
01:02:55.325 --> 01:02:59.165
either fear or like fascination with her?

1153
01:03:04.275 --> 01:03:08.165
Stay focused on Scriptures?

1154
01:03:10.925 --> 01:03:13.005
I think we need to recognize constant s

1155
01:03:21.835 --> 01:03:22.835
What else?

1156
01:03:25.015 --> 01:03:27.765
Power, evil, But limited.

1157
01:03:33.545 --> 01:03:35.845
So that's the balance. Recognizing that there is power,

1158
01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.445
but that is limited by God.

1159
01:03:37.665 --> 01:03:41.205
Yes, The word victory comes to my mind.

1160
01:03:41.265 --> 01:03:42.605
So we don't wrestle against flesh

1161
01:03:42.605 --> 01:03:44.205
and blood against the spiritual forces.

1162
01:03:44.425 --> 01:03:45.485
So the more engaging

1163
01:03:45.945 --> 01:03:49.125
and maybe challenging situations to acknowledge that

1164
01:03:49.785 --> 01:03:52.125
and then to go to God in prayer

1165
01:03:52.545 --> 01:03:54.525
and asking for him to step in

1166
01:03:54.785 --> 01:03:57.485
and remove, to resist divine, to review

1167
01:03:57.705 --> 01:03:58.965
to, to deal with that.

1168
01:03:59.745 --> 01:04:02.165
And so that's an opportunity for us to exercise prayer

1169
01:04:03.205 --> 01:04:05.205
'cause he's the one who grants us the victory.

1170
01:04:10.355 --> 01:04:12.845
When I was reading that chapter and thinking about it

1171
01:04:13.065 --> 01:04:16.965
and making my notes on it, I, what came to my mind was, uh,

1172
01:04:18.165 --> 01:04:19.525
a phrase, it shows my age.

1173
01:04:19.745 --> 01:04:21.125
The devil made me do it.

1174
01:04:22.385 --> 01:04:24.885
And I think it was a comedian that came up with that phrase

1175
01:04:25.105 --> 01:04:29.645
and studied, uh, I guess, um,

1176
01:04:30.505 --> 01:04:33.445
the idea that the devil makes us do things

1177
01:04:34.545 --> 01:04:36.365
as an excuse for our behavior.

1178
01:04:36.785 --> 01:04:40.885
Mm-hmm. Um, if I thought more about it, it was, uh,

1179
01:04:41.025 --> 01:04:45.205
really an absurd thought process is that, um, again,

1180
01:04:45.205 --> 01:04:47.125
the influence as opposed to possession

1181
01:04:47.465 --> 01:04:50.285
and what we choose to be around and have.

1182
01:04:50.585 --> 01:04:54.205
But I often remember we were in Nicaragua one time

1183
01:04:54.345 --> 01:04:57.485
and we were near a village

1184
01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:59.565
and someone was talking to us

1185
01:04:59.565 --> 01:05:02.845
and said, well, this, this particular village was a really

1186
01:05:02.995 --> 01:05:06.165
dark history, uh, um,

1187
01:05:06.785 --> 01:05:09.605
and the spirit of, of, of,

1188
01:05:09.785 --> 01:05:12.285
of demon influence in this village.

1189
01:05:12.585 --> 01:05:16.965
And so, um, that was a, that was an opportunity for prayer,

1190
01:05:17.145 --> 01:05:20.125
an opportunity for to be be in that division, but

1191
01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:21.605
but also be aware of that.

1192
01:05:22.915 --> 01:05:25.165
It's, it's there Definitely we

1193
01:05:25.165 --> 01:05:26.165
Have to recognize.

1194
01:05:33.965 --> 01:05:37.525
I sort of want to add to Lewis's quote, what did he say?

1195
01:05:37.595 --> 01:05:39.725
Fear and fascination.

1196
01:05:40.905 --> 01:05:43.405
Uh, it says there's two op equal opposite errors.

1197
01:05:43.465 --> 01:05:44.605
One is the disbelief.

1198
01:05:45.035 --> 01:05:46.805
There's sense the others to believe and feel

1199
01:05:46.805 --> 01:05:48.325
An excessive healthy interest.

1200
01:05:48.635 --> 01:05:51.125
Okay? Yeah. And then there's sort of fear and fascination.

1201
01:05:51.525 --> 01:05:55.685
I think there's also confusion, like we strive more power to

1202
01:05:56.735 --> 01:05:57.925
evils than it actually has.

1203
01:05:58.475 --> 01:06:00.125
Like it's evil, it's powerful,

1204
01:06:00.865 --> 01:06:03.125
but it wants to magnify that in our minds.

1205
01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:07.405
Like the rivalry is actually kind of

1206
01:06:08.695 --> 01:06:12.485
superpower and lose it about,

1207
01:06:12.625 --> 01:06:17.125
but it's just not name y it's not a, it's not dualistic.

1208
01:06:17.355 --> 01:06:20.405
It's uh, it's a temporary

1209
01:06:20.465 --> 01:06:24.365
and limited force that wants you

1210
01:06:24.365 --> 01:06:26.725
to think it's more powerful than actually

1211
01:06:33.435 --> 01:06:37.925
Were playing from the w playing from the w picture.

1212
01:06:39.845 --> 01:06:40.845
I just have a mental picture.

1213
01:06:40.985 --> 01:06:44.205
Is it in pilgrim's progress where he has to go to the house

1214
01:06:44.385 --> 01:06:47.285
and he's got these big lions, he has the walkthrough?

1215
01:06:47.745 --> 01:06:50.485
No, Those lions are on a chain

1216
01:06:51.385 --> 01:06:52.765
and if calls the light

1217
01:06:53.545 --> 01:06:56.485
and on the path, they're, they're constrained

1218
01:06:56.585 --> 01:06:59.325
so they can gore and they can intimidate and generate fear.

1219
01:07:00.185 --> 01:07:02.605
But the victory is by following that light.

1220
01:07:02.665 --> 01:07:04.925
And that's a mental picture of the reality of

1221
01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:06.565
those dark spirits,

1222
01:07:07.145 --> 01:07:10.245
but the victory that we did in Jesus, who they on,

1223
01:07:29.225 --> 01:07:33.725
You know, uh, excuse me while I connect this,

1224
01:07:34.585 --> 01:07:36.445
I'm gonna have to shorter than all you guys.

1225
01:07:46.305 --> 01:07:49.045
Um, one thing I like to ask

1226
01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:52.685
whenever thinking about angels is, um,

1227
01:07:53.475 --> 01:07:56.405
what kind are we talking about?

1228
01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:59.845
Right? You know, how many their angelic beings, you know,

1229
01:08:00.245 --> 01:08:01.845
seraphim share them.

1230
01:08:03.065 --> 01:08:04.245
If I can get this, uh,

1231
01:08:05.295 --> 01:08:09.165
lemme know when you get it out not working.

1232
01:08:24.085 --> 01:08:25.365
I upgrade my technology.

1233
01:08:27.665 --> 01:08:32.325
Did you guys all get, did you guys all get your memory

1234
01:08:32.325 --> 01:08:36.885
reverse card here in a minute.

1235
01:08:36.905 --> 01:08:39.965
If you don't have one, then grab, look at your neighbors.

1236
01:08:39.965 --> 01:08:42.085
Grab it here a minute. Um,

1237
01:08:47.155 --> 01:08:50.725
what we'll do is take a minute and pray that to together.

1238
01:08:53.005 --> 01:08:57.405
I love this. I dunno if you've ever seen this me.

1239
01:08:59.745 --> 01:09:02.245
You got, it's like one of the living creatures for Ezekiel.

1240
01:09:03.065 --> 01:09:04.645
And it says, be not afraid.

1241
01:09:05.625 --> 01:09:06.685
And this guy says, sir,

1242
01:09:06.685 --> 01:09:09.725
this is the scariest moment of my life.

1243
01:09:12.465 --> 01:09:14.365
You know, uh, I think it was Al Moler, you know,

1244
01:09:14.365 --> 01:09:15.765
the president of Southern Seminary.

1245
01:09:16.265 --> 01:09:18.925
He said, uh, biblically typically what happens when somebody

1246
01:09:19.525 --> 01:09:21.565
actually encounters an angel in the Bible

1247
01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:22.805
is they pee their pants.

1248
01:09:23.585 --> 01:09:28.405
And, um, because they always say don't be afraid, right?

1249
01:09:28.825 --> 01:09:31.245
So there's something awesome about them, you know,

1250
01:09:31.245 --> 01:09:32.725
and it reflects the glory of God.

1251
01:09:32.905 --> 01:09:34.125
And, uh, just a good reminder.

1252
01:09:34.395 --> 01:09:37.205
They're always saying, Hey, don't worship me. Right?

1253
01:09:37.205 --> 01:09:38.525
There's something awesome about them,

1254
01:09:38.705 --> 01:09:40.925
but there's also, uh, well,

1255
01:09:40.925 --> 01:09:42.605
just a reflection of the glory of God.

1256
01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:45.565
I think, uh, the other thing I was thinking about about

1257
01:09:46.035 --> 01:09:50.845
with prayer, I just wanted to add is that I think, you know,

1258
01:09:51.445 --> 01:09:53.085
whenever, like we've justing about all the things we've

1259
01:09:53.085 --> 01:09:57.085
talked about just now, when we think about the nature

1260
01:09:57.105 --> 01:10:01.565
of God, uh, one of them is that, that, that the idea

1261
01:10:01.565 --> 01:10:04.165
of prayer, the topic of prayer reminds us that

1262
01:10:04.755 --> 01:10:06.085
it's something about God.

1263
01:10:06.265 --> 01:10:08.805
It reminds us specifically about God

1264
01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:10.285
himself, his very nature.

1265
01:10:11.105 --> 01:10:14.845
And, uh, it reminds us that God, uh, that God speaks

1266
01:10:16.065 --> 01:10:19.405
and that God hears, like these are things

1267
01:10:19.405 --> 01:10:20.805
that are true about him.

1268
01:10:21.465 --> 01:10:26.085
He, he is a communicating God and he wants us, he

1269
01:10:26.085 --> 01:10:29.165
and Vigi commands us to relate to him.

1270
01:10:29.705 --> 01:10:31.885
And uh, and I think sometimes we confuse prayer,

1271
01:10:31.985 --> 01:10:33.765
but I'm just asking for things.

1272
01:10:34.305 --> 01:10:36.205
Uh, I'm just telling God my complaints

1273
01:10:36.545 --> 01:10:37.805
and all those things are relevant.

1274
01:10:37.805 --> 01:10:40.525
We do ask for things. We do express our, our desires,

1275
01:10:40.525 --> 01:10:42.205
even our, our struggles to God.

1276
01:10:42.785 --> 01:10:45.925
But, but fundamentally, I think the more we know who he is

1277
01:10:46.265 --> 01:10:49.485
and what he's like, the more easily we pray.

1278
01:10:49.485 --> 01:10:51.925
Because it's just like learning to communicate

1279
01:10:51.925 --> 01:10:53.365
with any other person.

1280
01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.085
Like he's a real person.

1281
01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.925
And, uh, and we communicate about things.

1282
01:10:57.925 --> 01:10:59.325
You, we think about if you're married

1283
01:10:59.345 --> 01:11:00.685
or a friendship that you have,

1284
01:11:00.685 --> 01:11:03.085
or what we express things we need and want.

1285
01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:05.605
But that is like not the only thing

1286
01:11:05.605 --> 01:11:07.005
that we talk about, right?

1287
01:11:07.005 --> 01:11:08.085
So we relate to each other.

1288
01:11:08.145 --> 01:11:10.445
We express love and affection for each other.

1289
01:11:10.505 --> 01:11:12.045
We communicate about all kinds of things.

1290
01:11:12.385 --> 01:11:16.685
So we recognize God speaks to us primarily in His Word,

1291
01:11:17.225 --> 01:11:21.005
and then we respond to his word by thinking about it.

1292
01:11:21.465 --> 01:11:25.085
Uh, reading, in listening, listening to God in His Word.

1293
01:11:25.385 --> 01:11:28.725
And then we respond in prayer. In, in how many ways?

1294
01:11:28.825 --> 01:11:32.245
In like every way that God's word addresses.

1295
01:11:32.345 --> 01:11:35.045
We, we talked to God about that, interact with, uh,

1296
01:11:35.135 --> 01:11:37.085
we've already talked about this, mentioned that a couple

1297
01:11:37.085 --> 01:11:39.085
of books I wanted to wave around one.

1298
01:11:39.085 --> 01:11:41.965
This is Steve. This the book you taught, I think it was, uh,

1299
01:11:42.025 --> 01:11:44.885
one of the first classes I took here was Steve's class on

1300
01:11:44.885 --> 01:11:48.445
prayer, praying, the Praying with Paul by DA Carson.

1301
01:11:49.215 --> 01:11:52.325
David, I know your favorite author. Yeah, sure.

1302
01:11:54.305 --> 01:11:56.445
Uh, as a staff.

1303
01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:59.205
We read this recently, earlier this year,

1304
01:11:59.365 --> 01:12:01.725
A Praying Life by Paul Miller.

1305
01:12:01.755 --> 01:12:06.085
Just real practical, I'd recommend that praying the Bible

1306
01:12:06.345 --> 01:12:09.645
by Donald Whitney is really practical way of just walking

1307
01:12:09.645 --> 01:12:11.405
through thinking about you.

1308
01:12:11.565 --> 01:12:13.845
I don't know what to pray. Well, God said a lot.

1309
01:12:13.905 --> 01:12:16.445
So like, read God's word and pray God's word.

1310
01:12:16.985 --> 01:12:18.125
And, um, anyway, good.

1311
01:12:18.235 --> 01:12:19.845
Another book by Don Whitney's,

1312
01:12:20.045 --> 01:12:21.725
spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life.

1313
01:12:22.025 --> 01:12:24.205
His chapter on, on prayer is great.

1314
01:12:24.845 --> 01:12:26.085
I would recommend all those.

1315
01:12:27.425 --> 01:12:28.805
Um, but

1316
01:12:28.805 --> 01:12:31.365
before we wrap up here, I just wanted to take a minute,

1317
01:12:31.895 --> 01:12:35.685
James four, seven to eight, if you guys have that.

1318
01:12:37.175 --> 01:12:38.525
Let's just take a moment.

1319
01:12:39.615 --> 01:12:43.685
Sorry, I turned off my, I'll come back to that.

1320
01:12:44.465 --> 01:12:46.645
Um, James 4, 7, 8.

1321
01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.005
It says, submit yourselves

1322
01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:53.005
therefore to God, resist the devil

1323
01:12:53.185 --> 01:12:56.685
and he will flee from you, draw near to God

1324
01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:59.245
and he will draw near to you though one

1325
01:12:59.245 --> 01:13:00.245
of the reasons I love this verse

1326
01:13:00.305 --> 01:13:02.085
for this topic is it talks about

1327
01:13:02.085 --> 01:13:03.485
everything that we talked about tonight.

1328
01:13:03.785 --> 01:13:06.925
It talks about prayer, it talks about resisting the devil,

1329
01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:10.005
it talks about the spiritual realities that are around us.

1330
01:13:10.425 --> 01:13:13.445
And so I'd like to just take a moment and, um,

1331
01:13:14.065 --> 01:13:15.285
and let's just pray through this.

1332
01:13:15.295 --> 01:13:19.045
Let's take 60 seconds and, and any

1333
01:13:19.185 --> 01:13:22.605
and any of you want to just sort of jump in in response to

1334
01:13:22.805 --> 01:13:24.405
what God has said in his word.

1335
01:13:24.785 --> 01:13:26.125
And let's pray. I'll start

1336
01:13:26.225 --> 01:13:27.885
and then we'll take a few minutes.

1337
01:13:27.905 --> 01:13:29.965
Please join in and then I'll close us.

1338
01:13:31.305 --> 01:13:35.125
Father, we thank you for the light of this specific word

1339
01:13:35.125 --> 01:13:37.765
that we read in James four, seven to eight.

1340
01:13:38.435 --> 01:13:39.885
There's a lot more that it says,

1341
01:13:39.905 --> 01:13:43.165
but first off, it says, we should submit to you.

1342
01:13:44.505 --> 01:13:47.045
And so, Lord, we do, we've said a lot of words tonight.

1343
01:13:47.045 --> 01:13:48.925
We've thought a lot of thoughts about you.

1344
01:13:49.335 --> 01:13:51.725
We've talked about you and about the spiritual realm

1345
01:13:51.725 --> 01:13:52.725
and the world you have made.

1346
01:13:53.385 --> 01:13:54.925
But what we do right now is we just

1347
01:13:55.125 --> 01:13:57.045
surrender ourselves to you.

1348
01:13:57.045 --> 01:13:58.085
Thank you for the invitation.

1349
01:13:59.505 --> 01:14:02.445
We thank you, Lord, for the opportunity to relate to you,

1350
01:14:02.465 --> 01:14:05.005
to communicate with you, to come near to you.

1351
01:14:05.025 --> 01:14:06.365
And so we begin there

1352
01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.805
I, whether you are God and

1353
01:14:26.775 --> 01:14:31.125
those two, be that people

1354
01:14:31.195 --> 01:14:34.845
that just honors you with our lips, but our hearts apart

1355
01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:35.085
From,

1356
01:14:49.665 --> 01:14:51.845
And the next part of this, we see the reality

1357
01:14:52.145 --> 01:14:54.805
of a malevolent spiritual force, the devil.

1358
01:14:55.585 --> 01:14:57.285
And, uh, we are told to resist him.

1359
01:14:57.425 --> 01:14:58.565
He does want

1360
01:14:58.565 --> 01:15:01.605
to make us do things like Steve was talking about there.

1361
01:15:01.735 --> 01:15:03.845
There are times that even feels like that, that,

1362
01:15:04.395 --> 01:15:07.765
that some other, that an enemy force made me

1363
01:15:08.465 --> 01:15:09.525
do the things I do.

1364
01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:11.405
And we do know that we wrestle against

1365
01:15:11.775 --> 01:15:13.485
indwelling sin in our lives.

1366
01:15:13.545 --> 01:15:16.245
We also wrestle against the personal reality

1367
01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:19.765
of evil in the devil and his angels, the demonic forces.

1368
01:15:19.945 --> 01:15:23.365
And so, Lord, we, we, we need your grace

1369
01:15:23.545 --> 01:15:25.445
and strength to resist him.

1370
01:15:25.465 --> 01:15:29.965
But I, I hear in this verse the reality that, that we can

1371
01:15:30.525 --> 01:15:32.845
actually resist him in Christ.

1372
01:15:33.755 --> 01:15:37.685
That there are things we can do to, to resist.

1373
01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:42.085
And there's a promise that when we do that,

1374
01:15:42.085 --> 01:15:43.925
he will flee from us.

1375
01:15:46.665 --> 01:15:49.965
Indeed, this last verse as we close, draw near to God

1376
01:15:49.985 --> 01:15:52.725
and he will draw near to you again.

1377
01:15:52.725 --> 01:15:55.845
Lord, we thank you for the invitation that you are there,

1378
01:15:55.955 --> 01:15:58.165
that you are real, that you are with us, that you speak,

1379
01:15:58.235 --> 01:15:59.685
that you hear, that you listen.

1380
01:16:00.275 --> 01:16:02.605
That you want to be known by us.

1381
01:16:03.585 --> 01:16:06.365
Indeed, you've made us in your image, you made us

1382
01:16:06.435 --> 01:16:09.245
with the ability to communicate one with another.

1383
01:16:09.785 --> 01:16:12.005
And it reflects the reality of our ability

1384
01:16:12.105 --> 01:16:13.565
to communicate also with you.

1385
01:16:14.145 --> 01:16:16.445
And that your, and your willingness and desire

1386
01:16:16.465 --> 01:16:19.925
and ability to communicate with us the Lord, we love you.

1387
01:16:20.705 --> 01:16:22.525
We thank you for your grace in our lives

1388
01:16:22.585 --> 01:16:23.605
as this verse goes on.

1389
01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:26.485
And there's confession of sin to which Lord, we claim

1390
01:16:26.745 --> 01:16:29.565
and admit our great need of your forgiveness

1391
01:16:29.665 --> 01:16:31.645
and mercy for all of our sin

1392
01:16:31.705 --> 01:16:34.445
and rebellion against you, not only in our past,

1393
01:16:34.625 --> 01:16:36.245
but even perhaps even today.

1394
01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:38.685
The struggles we'll face tomorrow, Lord,

1395
01:16:38.685 --> 01:16:39.885
that's it's not right.

1396
01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:43.045
And yet we're weak and we struggle and we draw near to you.

1397
01:16:43.425 --> 01:16:45.205
And we pray for grace and mercy in

1398

If you need to go, uh, please feel free.

1402
01:16:56.275 --> 01:16:59.165
What I'd like sign your roster first, what I'd like

1403
01:16:59.165 --> 01:17:02.285
to do is just take a minute and sing a song together.

1404
01:17:02.585 --> 01:17:07.205
Um, so if you guys need to go, uh, it's time's up.

1405
01:17:08.025 --> 01:17:09.245
So feel free to take off.

1406
01:17:09.305 --> 01:17:13.325
But I'd like to sing A Mighty Fortress is Our God.

1407
01:17:13.625 --> 01:17:17.205
And, uh, if you're willing to stay, um, stand up, join us,

1408
01:17:18.065 --> 01:17:20.125
and, uh, you gotta go sing it on your way.

1409
01:17:20.865 --> 01:17:23.125
You pick that song out. I picked it.

01:17:24.685 --> 01:17:29.605
