This is Gage Randall,

2
00:00:04.225 --> 00:00:07.565
and he is going to be a freshman in a couple weeks.

3
00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:10.965
Um, but this past, uh, couple months we've been able

4
00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:12.445
to have just conversations over

5
00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:14.005
what the Lord is doing in his life.

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:15.245
And so I just wanna share a little bit of that.

7
00:00:15.745 --> 00:00:16.765
Um, me

8
00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:19.445
and Gage were talking just about how, uh,

9
00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.925
the Lord is showing him that salvation belongs to him.

10
00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:25.085
Nothing we can do can earn that,

11
00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:29.085
but it is all him, uh, his saving power, uh,

12
00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:32.645
and his saving grace in his life that will transform Gage.

13
00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:35.525
And so Gage, based on your profession of faith

14
00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:39.045
and our conversations, it is now my honor to get

15
00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:41.085
to baptize you In the name of the Father,

16
00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:42.645
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

17
00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.395
Good morning church.

18
00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:54.155
Isn't that a beautiful thing to celebrate?
