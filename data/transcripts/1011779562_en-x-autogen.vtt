WEBVTT

1
00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:21.285
Good morning again, church.

2
00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:23.005
My name's John, one of the pastors here.

3
00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:24.525
Uh, if you're new to our church,

4
00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:25.645
we're grateful you'd be here.

5
00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:26.725
We'd love to meet you.

6
00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:28.765
Uh, if you've been here for a long time.

7
00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:30.165
We also are glad you're here

8
00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:32.725
and we love that we get to do this together.

9
00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:34.765
Uh, so go ahead and take your copy of God's Word.

10
00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:39.565
Turn with me to First Samuel. We're going through this book.

11
00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:42.325
We'll be in chapter eight today.

12
00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:44.045
First Samuel, chapter eight.

13
00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:48.365
Now, you may have noticed that I have a loop

14
00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:49.885
of climbing rope up here.

15
00:00:50.345 --> 00:00:52.365
We thought of having me repel down from the ceiling,

16
00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:53.405
but that might be a bit too much.

17
00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:55.965
So, uh, this is what we're gonna do with this.

18
00:00:56.315 --> 00:00:59.125
It's just something that is an illustration of

19
00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.325
what I heard a pastor talk about one time, the difference

20
00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:03.725
between repelling and climbing.

21
00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:05.685
Uh, that there is a difference.

22
00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:08.085
Maybe you don't understand that, but let me explain it.

23
00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:11.805
When you repel, you start at the top of a rock face

24
00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:14.485
and you kind of lean back onto the rope.

25
00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:16.245
And to get down, you have

26
00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:19.205
to put your whole weight on the rope as you kind of hop

27
00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.325
or walk down the rock face.

28
00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:27.695
But when you rock climb, you are finding footholds

29
00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:31.255
and handholds to climb up the rock, rock face.

30
00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:35.935
And the rope is there merely if you fall off, if you

31
00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:38.895
misstep and you are

32
00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:41.975
secure in case you fall.

33
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.015
There's other people who actually climb with no ropes, but,

34
00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:47.855
but that's who most people, as most people would do,

35
00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:51.455
is they climb with a rope as a safety net.

36
00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:55.475
Have you ever considered that?

37
00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:57.835
Maybe that's what you are doing in your

38
00:01:57.835 --> 00:01:59.315
relationship with God.

39
00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.415
Do you merely want God as your safety net

40
00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:10.325
as your rope if you fall,

41
00:02:11.655 --> 00:02:13.795
but primarily you're trusting in your own strength

42
00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:16.835
and you climb in life?

43
00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:21.995
Do you not fully trust him

44
00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:25.835
like you would when you repel down the face?

45
00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:29.355
We're actually gonna see an example of that

46
00:02:29.965 --> 00:02:31.235
today in one Samuel.

47
00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:32.915
As we continue our journey through this book.

48
00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:35.275
We're we're coming today to a pivotal section

49
00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:38.675
regarding the shift to a monarchy

50
00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:40.835
that's been building throughout one Samuel.

51
00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:44.155
Now there's this, the distinct moment where this happens.

52
00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:45.995
In reality though, there's a deeper question.

53
00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:48.875
It's not just structural government type stuff.

54
00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:50.355
We're gonna see a civics lesson.

55
00:02:50.455 --> 00:02:55.105
The deeper question that is asked here is, who shall reign?

56
00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:58.895
Who shall reign?

57
00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:02.605
Who will sit on the throne of the people's hearts,

58
00:03:03.855 --> 00:03:05.355
who will sit on the throne of their nation?

59
00:03:05.495 --> 00:03:07.595
Yes, but who's gonna sit on the throne of their hearts?

60
00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:10.865
Who's gonna be the one to protect them

61
00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:12.905
and prosper them and fulfill them?

62
00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:14.185
Who's gonna be the one that trust to do that?

63
00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:19.095
And we're faced with similar questions today, right?

64
00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:23.095
Who's gonna sit on the throne of our hearts?

65
00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:28.245
Who will we trust to bring us prosperity

66
00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.565
and security and fulfillment?

67
00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:36.745
Those are essential questions that we'll see today.

68
00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:39.305
Look now at chapter eight verses one through nine.

69
00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:47.185
When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel.

70
00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:50.825
The name of his firstborn son was Joel, the name

71
00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:51.905
of his second Aja.

72
00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:53.625
There were judges in Beersheba,

73
00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:55.585
which is a very south part of the nation.

74
00:03:56.285 --> 00:03:59.505
Yet his sons did not walk in his ways, but turned aside

75
00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.185
after gain and they took bribes

76
00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:05.105
and perverted justice sounds familiar to what we saw, right?

77
00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:06.465
With Eli and his sons.

78
00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:09.805
Then all the elders of Israel gathered together came

79
00:04:09.805 --> 00:04:12.725
to Samuel at Rama and said to him, behold, you are old

80
00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:14.565
and your sons do not walk in your ways.

81
00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:19.205
Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations.

82
00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:22.145
But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said,

83
00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:23.545
give us a king to judge us.

84
00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.305
And Samuel prayed to the Lord,

85
00:04:25.525 --> 00:04:28.505
and the Lord said to Samuel, obey the voice

86
00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:30.265
of the people in all that they say to you,

87
00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:32.425
for they have not rejected you,

88
00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:36.145
but they have rejected me from being king over them

89
00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:38.655
according to all the deeds

90
00:04:38.655 --> 00:04:40.695
that they've done from the day I brought them up out

91
00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:43.855
of Egypt, even to this day forsaking me

92
00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:45.535
and serving other gods.

93
00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:50.735
So they're also doing to you now then obey their voice.

94
00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:53.655
Only you shall solemnly warn them

95
00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:55.615
and show them the ways of the king

96
00:04:55.675 --> 00:04:56.975
who shall reign over them.

97
00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:01.815
So a lot of time has passed since we saw Samuel

98
00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:05.535
as a young boy left in the tabernacle to serve the Lord.

99
00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:09.295
And, and it's a long time has passed as he's been called

100
00:05:09.295 --> 00:05:11.575
to ministry, he's actually been serving publicly.

101
00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:14.495
But what Samuel did here, we, we learned, is

102
00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:17.575
that he was actually perpetuating the same system

103
00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:19.455
of government that they had had prior.

104
00:05:20.715 --> 00:05:22.895
In fact, he was doing it in a way that was kind

105
00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:26.575
of creating this lineage in a, in a sense, perpetuating

106
00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:29.375
what would turn into being the monarchy.

107
00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.315
Like he was opening the door wide open to it,

108
00:05:33.315 --> 00:05:34.635
appointing his sons as judges.

109
00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:36.275
Like that's just what they did.

110
00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:40.645
And so the door swings open, the people asked.

111
00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:41.725
But like I've said this

112
00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:43.965
before, none of these things surprised God.

113
00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:49.445
In fact, in all the way back in Deuteronomy 17, verse 20,

114
00:05:49.585 --> 00:05:52.205
God had told Israel he would give them a king one day.

115
00:05:53.295 --> 00:05:54.555
So God knew this was coming.

116
00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:57.725
It was the way that they asked here

117
00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:59.005
that would displease God.

118
00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:03.335
Did you see it? Right? Verse eight, God said,

119
00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:05.935
Israel had forsaken him.

120
00:06:07.165 --> 00:06:09.025
They'd served these other gods.

121
00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:11.935
In fact, in verse seven, we put this

122
00:06:11.935 --> 00:06:13.095
as the main point on your notes.

123
00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:14.255
God said it this way.

124
00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:21.445
They have rejected me from being king over them,

125
00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:25.215
right God, God said that.

126
00:06:25.215 --> 00:06:28.895
Listen again, they have rejected me

127
00:06:29.805 --> 00:06:32.375
from being king over them.

128
00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:36.835
Just think about that for a second.

129
00:06:39.975 --> 00:06:41.635
God already was their king.

130
00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:46.285
He was the one who had protect them, prosper them,

131
00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:50.485
fulfill them, but they

132
00:06:51.165 --> 00:06:55.665
rejected him as that a word

133
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.225
that brings with it the idea of contempt.

134
00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:02.605
You could almost read this like they spit in his face

135
00:07:03.975 --> 00:07:06.015
whenever they said, no, we don't want you as our king,

136
00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:07.885
we want another king.

137
00:07:10.735 --> 00:07:12.145
They got impatient, right?

138
00:07:14.365 --> 00:07:16.005
I mean, 'cause just think about their situation.

139
00:07:16.005 --> 00:07:18.245
They had physical needs that they had to have met.

140
00:07:18.245 --> 00:07:20.525
They had these enemies that were lurking all

141
00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:21.765
around them all the time

142
00:07:22.105 --> 00:07:25.005
and they thought they needed someone more tangible,

143
00:07:25.355 --> 00:07:27.485
more reliable than an invisible God.

144
00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:28.725
They weren't really sure where he was,

145
00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:30.685
but they need somebody they can see

146
00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.885
who can lead them into battle, which is a rejection

147
00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:35.405
of the very thing

148
00:07:35.405 --> 00:07:37.885
that made them distinct from all the nations around them.

149
00:07:42.475 --> 00:07:43.735
How silly they were, right?

150
00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:47.955
Like we, we would, we would never do that,

151
00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:53.185
as Dwight would say, false, right?

152
00:07:54.755 --> 00:07:56.655
We do this all the time.

153
00:08:00.055 --> 00:08:04.125
Here's one way. We need

154
00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:06.165
to see a couple extra zeros at the end

155
00:08:06.165 --> 00:08:09.085
of our bank account just to make sure we're secure.

156
00:08:13.805 --> 00:08:16.795
Maybe this one, here's, here's

157
00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:19.075
how we can place our hope outside of God.

158
00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:21.955
We can, we can hope in something other than God.

159
00:08:23.395 --> 00:08:25.985
Every day on the news, every day on your Facebook feed

160
00:08:26.565 --> 00:08:30.905
claims, this is the most consequential election in history.

161
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.345
They said it four years ago,

162
00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:34.865
they said it four years ago before that.

163
00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:37.305
They'll say it in four years from now, everyone.

164
00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:40.025
And what it does is it stirs up fear.

165
00:08:40.365 --> 00:08:41.825
It stirs up this panic,

166
00:08:41.965 --> 00:08:45.785
and we're placing our hope in something outside of God.

167
00:08:47.955 --> 00:08:49.335
And listen, I even as I say that,

168
00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:50.895
we live in a democratic republic,

169
00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:52.695
so we have the privilege to get to vote.

170
00:08:52.795 --> 00:08:57.085
So pray, vote your conscience. Yes, absolutely do that.

171
00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:03.085
But let's stop acting as if a certain candidate gets elected

172
00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:05.405
or a certain candidate doesn't get elected,

173
00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:09.165
then the whole world will spin out of control, right?

174
00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:11.045
Because is God not sovereign over this thing?

175
00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:15.925
Does he not have a plan? Is he not good?

176
00:09:19.805 --> 00:09:23.905
Here's my point. Whether it's a politician or a job

177
00:09:25.535 --> 00:09:27.435
or a spouse or a bank account

178
00:09:27.615 --> 00:09:30.995
or whatever it is, we forsake God.

179
00:09:31.065 --> 00:09:32.875
When we trust any other king,

180
00:09:37.255 --> 00:09:38.875
we forsake God.

181
00:09:39.335 --> 00:09:42.235
Now notice this is in quotes, the king word, right?

182
00:09:42.255 --> 00:09:45.715
We forsake God when we trust any other king.

183
00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:52.755
'cause here's the truth, God is the king.

184
00:09:54.515 --> 00:09:57.855
He is the king of kings and the Lord of lords.

185
00:09:57.855 --> 00:10:02.445
In fact, I love the way Psalm 47 puts it. Clap your hands.

186
00:10:02.545 --> 00:10:05.525
All peoples shout to God with loud songs of joy

187
00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:09.445
for the Lord, Yahweh, the most high is to be feared.

188
00:10:09.965 --> 00:10:14.605
A great king over all the earth. Amen. Sing praises to God.

189
00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:17.765
Sing praises to our king. Sing praises.

190
00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:20.845
For God is the king of all the earth.

191
00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:25.525
Sing praises with a psalm. God reigns over the nations.

192
00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:28.485
God sits on his holy throne.

193
00:10:28.585 --> 00:10:33.205
So hear me this, we cannot knock him off his throne.

194
00:10:34.485 --> 00:10:38.145
He absolutely is always will be. That's his rightful place.

195
00:10:38.245 --> 00:10:42.845
But here's what we can do just like Israel did.

196
00:10:44.015 --> 00:10:47.745
We can forsake him with contempt.

197
00:10:50.475 --> 00:10:53.885
We can act as if we're the king of our own lives.

198
00:10:53.975 --> 00:10:55.245
We've got a chair.

199
00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:58.645
Listen, I heard a one of our staff members told me this,

200
00:10:58.645 --> 00:11:02.405
that their child wrote this simple one sentence story

201
00:11:04.435 --> 00:11:08.175
and it was a b, a boy named Bob who had a chair

202
00:11:08.515 --> 00:11:10.535
and he liked to play king with it.

203
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.055
Is that not what we see happen every

204
00:11:15.055 --> 00:11:16.295
single day in our own hearts.

205
00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:19.225
We have a chair and we like to play king with it.

206
00:11:20.005 --> 00:11:22.195
We think we're the king of our own lives.

207
00:11:22.295 --> 00:11:25.315
We act as if this or that will give us protection

208
00:11:25.315 --> 00:11:26.715
or provision or fulfillment.

209
00:11:26.745 --> 00:11:28.315
That that's what's gonna be our hope.

210
00:11:28.315 --> 00:11:31.395
That's what's going to be sufficient and suffice for us.

211
00:11:31.655 --> 00:11:33.955
That's what we mean by king here.

212
00:11:35.275 --> 00:11:37.375
You can't take God off his throne.

213
00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:41.455
But anything we look to for provision, protection,

214
00:11:41.455 --> 00:11:44.415
fulfillment, anything, we seek to find it.

215
00:11:44.465 --> 00:11:46.895
Which the Bible also identifies as idolatry.

216
00:11:48.845 --> 00:11:51.145
It doesn't have to be figurines and things on shelves.

217
00:11:51.285 --> 00:11:53.405
It can be what you look for.

218
00:11:53.515 --> 00:11:57.365
What I look for for purpose and provision and fulfillment.

219
00:11:58.065 --> 00:12:00.445
That's the king we're talking about.

220
00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:03.965
And only God was meant to carry the weight

221
00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:05.925
of kingship in our lives.

222
00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:12.115
Nothing else. It's all shifting, crumbling foundations.

223
00:12:13.105 --> 00:12:17.075
Only God can be the true king and carry that.

224
00:12:22.525 --> 00:12:24.025
Now back to the story. Did you see

225
00:12:24.025 --> 00:12:26.025
what God told Samuel in verse nine?

226
00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:30.235
Samuel's like, Hey God, they asked for a king.

227
00:12:30.245 --> 00:12:31.435
God's like, okay, give 'em a king,

228
00:12:33.025 --> 00:12:37.095
but you shall solemnly warn them

229
00:12:37.595 --> 00:12:38.615
and show them the ways

230
00:12:38.615 --> 00:12:39.935
of the king who shall reign over them.

231
00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.545
Be careful what you ask for, right?

232
00:12:46.425 --> 00:12:48.825
'cause look how Samuel then spoke to the people.

233
00:12:48.825 --> 00:12:51.505
Look at verses 10 through 18 and kids listen for something.

234
00:12:51.545 --> 00:12:52.985
I want to, I'm gonna emphasize a word.

235
00:12:53.605 --> 00:12:55.585
So kids try to check, check in.

236
00:12:55.585 --> 00:12:56.905
Listen to what I say,

237
00:12:57.025 --> 00:12:58.985
what I emphasize here, verses 10 through 18.

238
00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:02.925
So Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people

239
00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:04.525
who are asking for a king from him.

240
00:13:05.505 --> 00:13:07.645
He said, these will be the ways of the king

241
00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:09.125
who shall reign over you.

242
00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:13.165
He will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots

243
00:13:13.165 --> 00:13:15.605
and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots.

244
00:13:15.905 --> 00:13:19.165
And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands,

245
00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.685
of commanders of fifties and sum to plow his ground,

246
00:13:21.705 --> 00:13:24.325
to reap his harvest, to make his implements of war

247
00:13:24.325 --> 00:13:25.765
and the equipment of his chariots.

248
00:13:26.225 --> 00:13:28.885
He will take your daughters to be perfumers

249
00:13:28.885 --> 00:13:30.085
and cooks and bakers.

250
00:13:30.265 --> 00:13:33.405
He will take the best of your fields and vineyards

251
00:13:33.405 --> 00:13:35.725
and olive orchards and give them to his servants.

252
00:13:36.425 --> 00:13:39.605
He will take the 10th of your grain of your vineyards,

253
00:13:39.715 --> 00:13:41.965
give it to his officers and his servants.

254
00:13:42.585 --> 00:13:44.525
He will take your male servants

255
00:13:44.525 --> 00:13:46.565
and female servants in the best of your young men

256
00:13:46.565 --> 00:13:48.405
and your donkeys and put them to his work.

257
00:13:49.185 --> 00:13:51.805
He will take the 10th of your flocks

258
00:13:51.805 --> 00:13:53.725
and you shall be his slaves.

259
00:13:55.245 --> 00:13:56.625
And in that day, you'll cry out

260
00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:58.865
because of your king whom you've chosen for yourselves.

261
00:13:59.285 --> 00:14:01.505
But the Lord will not answer you in that day.

262
00:14:03.795 --> 00:14:08.595
Did you catch it? Here's why I

263
00:14:08.595 --> 00:14:09.875
emphasize that

264
00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:14.095
because what God was telling the people there is

265
00:14:14.385 --> 00:14:18.065
that any other king will only take,

266
00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:19.465
he will not give

267
00:14:24.915 --> 00:14:26.975
any king that we set up

268
00:14:28.885 --> 00:14:31.975
will take from us, not give to us.

269
00:14:35.655 --> 00:14:38.195
Now, what Samuel was describing was the common practice

270
00:14:38.195 --> 00:14:40.995
of kings back then at his time.

271
00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:44.155
It's how worldly kings functioned back then.

272
00:14:44.215 --> 00:14:45.875
It makes total sense, right?

273
00:14:45.875 --> 00:14:48.155
They, they needed young men in their army

274
00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:49.675
to defend the nation.

275
00:14:49.695 --> 00:14:51.725
And so they would conscript these young men,

276
00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:54.725
they would assign some to work in his fields

277
00:14:54.925 --> 00:14:56.485
'cause he had a lot of fields to provide

278
00:14:56.485 --> 00:14:59.205
for all the things he needed to work in his palace to

279
00:14:59.385 --> 00:15:01.885
to do work in the manufacturing, all of that.

280
00:15:02.065 --> 00:15:04.965
He would snatch the fields of people to provide

281
00:15:05.065 --> 00:15:07.485
for his people that he had working for him.

282
00:15:07.905 --> 00:15:12.205
And in the end, what it led to was enslaving the people.

283
00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:18.695
Which is why verse 18 in that day, you will cry out

284
00:15:18.695 --> 00:15:22.575
because of your king whom you've chosen for yourselves.

285
00:15:25.555 --> 00:15:27.055
In other words, God was saying, Hey,

286
00:15:27.055 --> 00:15:29.135
I'm warning you this will not go well.

287
00:15:29.955 --> 00:15:33.575
If you do it the way you want to, it's not going

288
00:15:33.835 --> 00:15:34.935
to end well.

289
00:15:38.185 --> 00:15:40.645
In fact, I love this two Chronicles 12, eight.

290
00:15:40.705 --> 00:15:43.485
In the new living translation, God says they,

291
00:15:43.625 --> 00:15:48.165
Israel will become the king's subjects slaves.

292
00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:51.645
So they will know the difference between serving me

293
00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:53.485
and serving earthly rulers.

294
00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:57.265
Like we have a choice. Who are we gonna serve?

295
00:16:01.045 --> 00:16:04.865
See? But, but again, like I said it, it wasn't the request

296
00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:07.145
for a king that was necessarily wrong

297
00:16:08.515 --> 00:16:09.795
'cause God said it was going to come.

298
00:16:10.775 --> 00:16:15.625
It was the way they went about it that as they asked

299
00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:19.225
for this worldly king, they also in the same breath

300
00:16:19.985 --> 00:16:21.105
rejected God.

301
00:16:23.945 --> 00:16:28.115
That's why God said to them, okay, okay, I'll, I'll give you

302
00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:31.415
what you want, but here's what's gonna come of it.

303
00:16:34.015 --> 00:16:37.145
This is what's going to happen when you do it the world's

304
00:16:37.245 --> 00:16:42.005
way because do you remember

305
00:16:42.065 --> 00:16:46.115
why Israel would, would be willing to submit

306
00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:47.355
to this worldly king?

307
00:16:47.415 --> 00:16:48.435
Why would they even do this?

308
00:16:49.195 --> 00:16:52.075
Remember it was because they felt this lack of security.

309
00:16:52.425 --> 00:16:54.915
They felt this lack of prosperity.

310
00:16:55.105 --> 00:16:56.795
They looked around and they saw

311
00:16:56.825 --> 00:16:58.555
that a worldly king would be better.

312
00:16:58.695 --> 00:17:00.155
We need somebody to lead us into battle

313
00:17:00.155 --> 00:17:01.395
like everybody else around us.

314
00:17:01.695 --> 00:17:04.275
We need to, we have this felt need here.

315
00:17:04.615 --> 00:17:07.235
We need to do something that would fix it.

316
00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:11.875
But remember what it ended up doing?

317
00:17:13.225 --> 00:17:17.005
Taking and taking and taking some more from them.

318
00:17:20.855 --> 00:17:23.755
But again, we can't sit here a couple thousand years later

319
00:17:23.755 --> 00:17:27.795
and look back and say, you guys have no clue

320
00:17:28.605 --> 00:17:30.855
because don't we do the same thing?

321
00:17:31.505 --> 00:17:34.575
Don't we get ourselves in the same situation they did.

322
00:17:34.955 --> 00:17:37.575
We feel a lack in our lives.

323
00:17:37.955 --> 00:17:41.775
And so we turn to something else to fix it.

324
00:17:44.905 --> 00:17:48.845
We turn to a king that can never satisfy,

325
00:17:49.795 --> 00:17:52.445
that was never intended to satisfy,

326
00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:56.205
but instead of giving what we need, it only takes from us.

327
00:17:59.235 --> 00:18:01.255
You heard it at the beginning of the service today.

328
00:18:04.805 --> 00:18:08.265
And we turn to things like pornography to try

329
00:18:08.265 --> 00:18:10.105
to satisfy the lust of our flesh.

330
00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:12.105
And what it ends up doing is it destroys

331
00:18:12.265 --> 00:18:13.665
and rots away our minds.

332
00:18:14.725 --> 00:18:17.845
It only takes from us, it takes families away,

333
00:18:20.905 --> 00:18:25.805
or you sacrifice yourself to climb that corporate ladder.

334
00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:28.965
But what it ends up doing is it destroys your family.

335
00:18:31.175 --> 00:18:36.095
It only takes from you or you set up

336
00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:39.735
a relationship as the fulfillment that you know you need.

337
00:18:41.605 --> 00:18:44.905
But what it ends up doing is it steals your joy when

338
00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:47.145
that person inevitably lets you down

339
00:18:50.225 --> 00:18:52.965
and you've looked to to have it give you something

340
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.925
and instead takes away something from it.

341
00:18:57.505 --> 00:19:00.765
Listen, if we present ourselves to

342
00:19:01.305 --> 00:19:04.765
any other king, it's not going to save us.

343
00:19:04.905 --> 00:19:07.125
In fact, it's only going to tyrannize us.

344
00:19:09.225 --> 00:19:11.885
It will only take, it will only take. It will only take.

345
00:19:11.905 --> 00:19:14.765
It will not give you what it promises, it will give you.

346
00:19:16.325 --> 00:19:19.145
It will not make you happy. It will only steal your joy.

347
00:19:19.285 --> 00:19:20.585
It will steal your peace.

348
00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:26.235
And Jesus said it very simply,

349
00:19:27.975 --> 00:19:32.255
familiar verse John 10 10, the thief comes only

350
00:19:32.475 --> 00:19:35.415
to steal and kill and destroy.

351
00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:41.595
But Jesus says, I came that they may have life

352
00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:43.195
and have it abundantly.

353
00:19:50.535 --> 00:19:55.425
So why do we do it? Why?

354
00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:58.625
Why do we walk down roads that lead to stealing

355
00:19:58.805 --> 00:20:00.545
and death destruction?

356
00:20:04.815 --> 00:20:08.435
Why do we turn to these other kings in our lives?

357
00:20:12.025 --> 00:20:15.875
Well watch why we see Israel here.

358
00:20:15.905 --> 00:20:19.595
Chapter eight, verse Samuel eight verses 19 through 22.

359
00:20:22.965 --> 00:20:24.245
Remember he had just warned them,

360
00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:27.965
this is what's gonna happen if you ask

361
00:20:27.965 --> 00:20:29.005
for a king like everybody else.

362
00:20:29.115 --> 00:20:32.985
This is what's gonna happen. He warned them. Watch verse 19.

363
00:20:33.965 --> 00:20:36.705
But the people refuse to obey the voice of Samuel.

364
00:20:37.815 --> 00:20:38.915
And they said, no,

365
00:20:39.535 --> 00:20:41.675
but there should be a king over us

366
00:20:43.295 --> 00:20:46.145
that we may also be like all the nations,

367
00:20:46.615 --> 00:20:49.365
that our king may judge us and go out before us

368
00:20:49.425 --> 00:20:50.565
and fight our battles.

369
00:20:52.665 --> 00:20:54.475
When Samuel had heard all the words of the people,

370
00:20:54.495 --> 00:20:56.035
he repeated them in the ears of the Lord.

371
00:20:56.135 --> 00:20:59.195
And the Lord said to Samuel, obey their voice.

372
00:20:59.345 --> 00:21:02.905
Make them a king. Samuel then said to the men of Israel,

373
00:21:02.965 --> 00:21:05.065
go every man to his city.

374
00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:09.895
You see what happened there?

375
00:21:11.515 --> 00:21:14.655
The point is, trouble comes when we start comparing.

376
00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:22.525
Trouble comes when we start comparing.

377
00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:29.245
Listen again to verse 20, their reasoning.

378
00:21:30.425 --> 00:21:34.125
So that we also may be like all the nations

379
00:21:35.185 --> 00:21:38.575
and that our king may judge us and go out before us

380
00:21:38.755 --> 00:21:40.015
and fight our battles.

381
00:21:42.545 --> 00:21:47.125
That was their reason. Now just stop

382
00:21:47.125 --> 00:21:49.005
for a second and think about where we've come.

383
00:21:49.005 --> 00:21:50.685
That's why we don't read this in a vacuum, right?

384
00:21:50.695 --> 00:21:52.525
We've walked from chapter one all the way through.

385
00:21:52.745 --> 00:21:54.285
Now we, we've watched this happen.

386
00:21:54.745 --> 00:21:56.845
Did they forget what had just

387
00:21:57.405 --> 00:21:59.005
happened in chapters five through seven?

388
00:22:01.545 --> 00:22:04.515
Like did they, did they completely lose the thought?

389
00:22:04.595 --> 00:22:06.155
I know it'd been a few years, but do

390
00:22:06.155 --> 00:22:07.435
you remember what God did?

391
00:22:07.895 --> 00:22:09.275
Do you remember on his own

392
00:22:09.585 --> 00:22:11.075
what God did in the whole process?

393
00:22:11.385 --> 00:22:12.875
Like the Ark of the Covenant going

394
00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:17.275
and God himself by himself invaded Felicia.

395
00:22:17.855 --> 00:22:22.235
He executed their God DayOne, he distributed plagues

396
00:22:22.235 --> 00:22:25.475
to the people and then he brought home all the plunder.

397
00:22:25.695 --> 00:22:29.355
And then not only that, he destroyed the Philistine army

398
00:22:29.425 --> 00:22:31.435
with thunder and a spirit of confusion.

399
00:22:31.575 --> 00:22:32.995
He did that all by himself.

400
00:22:34.375 --> 00:22:37.835
And the Israelites were watching all of that happen.

401
00:22:40.175 --> 00:22:41.235
No, we still need a king.

402
00:22:46.845 --> 00:22:48.455
They could even look back to Exodus.

403
00:22:48.775 --> 00:22:51.815
Remember Exodus, God himself plagues in all the people.

404
00:22:52.275 --> 00:22:53.535
Red Sea splits open,

405
00:22:54.025 --> 00:22:57.055
saves his people from Israel, from from Egypt.

406
00:23:00.105 --> 00:23:02.485
No, we need a king. We can see

407
00:23:08.505 --> 00:23:12.805
Now listen, all the other nations around us have a king.

408
00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:13.885
We need one too.

409
00:23:20.965 --> 00:23:24.055
But listen, isn't that the same reason that we

410
00:23:24.195 --> 00:23:26.855
so quickly trust in other things besides God too?

411
00:23:31.405 --> 00:23:34.505
We forget what God has done, but then we look around

412
00:23:34.845 --> 00:23:37.825
and we see that man, their life seems so good

413
00:23:40.105 --> 00:23:43.345
I it that seems to be working for them.

414
00:23:44.645 --> 00:23:47.275
So maybe I need that too. May.

415
00:23:47.275 --> 00:23:49.515
Maybe I am missing out on something here.

416
00:23:51.535 --> 00:23:54.915
And instead of trusting the invisible

417
00:23:55.495 --> 00:23:59.275
yet powerful God who works on his timing, not ours.

418
00:23:59.545 --> 00:24:01.715
What we start doing is we start drifting away

419
00:24:01.855 --> 00:24:05.115
to all these other weak kings,

420
00:24:07.795 --> 00:24:09.595
trusting them to fix it.

421
00:24:09.705 --> 00:24:10.195
Somehow

422
00:24:14.935 --> 00:24:19.875
we see God as our safety net, not as our full trust.

423
00:24:24.565 --> 00:24:29.025
See, you and I can be climbing the rock face of our lives.

424
00:24:31.505 --> 00:24:35.095
We're sure glad that God is there if we'd ever need him,

425
00:24:40.325 --> 00:24:44.235
but we don't really fully trust to where we're leaning back

426
00:24:44.335 --> 00:24:48.105
and just falling knowing He's got it.

427
00:24:50.425 --> 00:24:52.595
What is that? It's pride.

428
00:24:54.935 --> 00:24:59.065
It's a rejection of God as king over us.

429
00:25:05.565 --> 00:25:07.145
And so where's the hope in this chapter?

430
00:25:10.015 --> 00:25:11.175
'cause it just kind of ends

431
00:25:12.495 --> 00:25:14.175
Samuel's frustrated it seems like.

432
00:25:14.175 --> 00:25:16.215
Get outta here. I don't even wanna see you anymore, right?

433
00:25:18.175 --> 00:25:22.995
Where's the hope here? We know Israel's going

434
00:25:22.995 --> 00:25:24.395
to get a king soon, but

435
00:25:24.935 --> 00:25:26.515
but how do we understand this chapter?

436
00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:28.995
'cause this is really the crux of the whole thing.

437
00:25:32.035 --> 00:25:33.045
Well, here's what we need.

438
00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:34.965
We, we need to go back a little bit

439
00:25:35.825 --> 00:25:36.885
to help us understand this.

440
00:25:36.905 --> 00:25:40.645
We need to go back in our minds to the book of Deuteronomy

441
00:25:40.655 --> 00:25:43.885
where just a few hundred years earlier,

442
00:25:44.985 --> 00:25:46.925
God had told the people through Moses

443
00:25:47.185 --> 00:25:52.155
how this whole thing was gonna go Listen to this.

444
00:25:52.155 --> 00:25:54.595
This is before they even entered the land.

445
00:25:54.825 --> 00:25:56.955
It's kind of in the process of them coming into the land.

446
00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:59.395
There's all of that. But they definitely were not settled.

447
00:25:59.505 --> 00:26:00.715
This was not home yet.

448
00:26:00.815 --> 00:26:02.915
But listen to what God says to the people.

449
00:26:02.915 --> 00:26:04.355
This is Deuteronomy 17.

450
00:26:05.635 --> 00:26:07.215
He says, when you come to the land

451
00:26:07.215 --> 00:26:10.535
that the Lord your God is giving you and you possess it

452
00:26:10.595 --> 00:26:12.495
and dwell in it and then say,

453
00:26:13.935 --> 00:26:16.665
I'll set a king over me like all the nations that are

454
00:26:16.665 --> 00:26:21.225
around me, you may indeed set a king over you whom the Lord

455
00:26:21.225 --> 00:26:23.945
your God will choose one from among your brothers.

456
00:26:23.965 --> 00:26:25.545
You shall set as king over you.

457
00:26:25.965 --> 00:26:27.705
You may not put a foreigner over you who's

458
00:26:27.705 --> 00:26:28.745
not your brother only.

459
00:26:28.745 --> 00:26:30.905
He must not acquire many horses for himself

460
00:26:31.165 --> 00:26:32.625
or cause the people to return

461
00:26:32.625 --> 00:26:34.145
to Egypt, to acquire many horses.

462
00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:35.745
Since the Lord has said to you,

463
00:26:35.745 --> 00:26:37.305
you shall never return that way again.

464
00:26:38.315 --> 00:26:40.375
He shall not acquire many wives for himself,

465
00:26:40.735 --> 00:26:41.775
lest his heart turn away,

466
00:26:42.075 --> 00:26:45.165
nor shall he acquire for himself excessive silver and gold.

467
00:26:45.965 --> 00:26:47.785
And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom,

468
00:26:48.045 --> 00:26:51.545
he shall write for himself in a book, a copy of this law

469
00:26:52.585 --> 00:26:55.105
approved by the Levitical priests, and it shall be with him.

470
00:26:55.285 --> 00:26:57.225
He shall read in it all the days of his life

471
00:26:57.255 --> 00:26:58.945
that he may learn to fear the Lord is God.

472
00:26:59.285 --> 00:27:02.105
By keeping all the words of the law and these statutes

473
00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:04.665
and doing them, that his heart may not be lifted up

474
00:27:04.675 --> 00:27:05.985
among above his brothers.

475
00:27:06.015 --> 00:27:08.705
That he may not turn aside from the commandment either

476
00:27:08.705 --> 00:27:10.185
to the right or the left, so

477
00:27:10.185 --> 00:27:13.145
that he may continue long in his kingdom, he

478
00:27:13.145 --> 00:27:15.145
and his children in Israel.

479
00:27:16.915 --> 00:27:19.135
So notice what God did hundreds of years

480
00:27:19.275 --> 00:27:21.055
before Sam for Samuel eight.

481
00:27:21.275 --> 00:27:25.845
He said, Hey guys, this thing could work it.

482
00:27:25.845 --> 00:27:27.165
It actually could work this way,

483
00:27:29.665 --> 00:27:31.075
even with a king.

484
00:27:31.135 --> 00:27:33.035
It could work. But did you see the conditions?

485
00:27:35.025 --> 00:27:36.205
And and I want you to see this

486
00:27:36.205 --> 00:27:38.765
because this has to be in our minds as we go forward

487
00:27:38.765 --> 00:27:42.445
through one Samuel, as we go through second Samuel, as we go

488
00:27:42.445 --> 00:27:44.805
through the rest of the Old Testament, this has

489
00:27:44.805 --> 00:27:46.245
to be right on the forefront

490
00:27:46.245 --> 00:27:47.605
of our minds thinking about the king.

491
00:27:47.905 --> 00:27:52.045
He says, the king must be chosen by the Lord, not by people.

492
00:27:54.505 --> 00:27:57.445
The king must be native to Israel, not a foreigner.

493
00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:02.675
The king can't trust his wealth or his resources.

494
00:28:04.055 --> 00:28:06.035
The king cannot have many wives

495
00:28:06.105 --> 00:28:09.355
that would turn his heart away toward the lust of the flesh.

496
00:28:09.535 --> 00:28:11.475
But there was also this, the last caveat.

497
00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:14.195
He said they have to keep God's word

498
00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:19.195
and the priesthood right in front of their face so

499
00:28:19.195 --> 00:28:22.675
that they would obey God in holiness and humility.

500
00:28:25.015 --> 00:28:26.625
It's the only way this was gonna work.

501
00:28:29.325 --> 00:28:32.165
And notice the result. Did you see that?

502
00:28:32.785 --> 00:28:36.925
So that he may continue long in his kingdom, he

503
00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:38.885
and his children in Israel.

504
00:28:39.215 --> 00:28:44.105
Again, this thing could work guys, in spite

505
00:28:44.365 --> 00:28:48.835
of the people asking wrongly, in spite

506
00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:52.195
of their rebellion against God, the Lord set it up

507
00:28:52.215 --> 00:28:56.875
to work in this way in spite of themselves.

508
00:28:57.055 --> 00:28:58.555
God would continue to work

509
00:28:58.815 --> 00:29:02.715
to bring about his redemptive purposes in Israel

510
00:29:02.945 --> 00:29:04.915
through a righteous king.

511
00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:08.825
And we'll see it some in Saul. We'll see it a lot.

512
00:29:08.885 --> 00:29:11.385
And David will see it a little bit throughout the rest

513
00:29:11.385 --> 00:29:12.945
of the history of Israel.

514
00:29:13.245 --> 00:29:17.235
The problem was none of them, none

515
00:29:17.235 --> 00:29:20.395
of those kings could live up to that standard perfectly.

516
00:29:24.015 --> 00:29:27.795
Not one of them could fully fulfill the design God had

517
00:29:27.815 --> 00:29:29.395
for a righteous king in Israel.

518
00:29:30.155 --> 00:29:33.835
None of 'em, even

519
00:29:33.945 --> 00:29:35.595
with the conditions God set

520
00:29:36.145 --> 00:29:39.315
what the people were wanting would never satisfy them.

521
00:29:43.565 --> 00:29:47.065
That's why in God's grace, he gives us what we need.

522
00:29:51.445 --> 00:29:56.065
In God's grace, he gives us what we actually need.

523
00:29:58.565 --> 00:30:02.775
What they needed and what we needed was a perfect king,

524
00:30:05.065 --> 00:30:08.945
A chosen son of David, native Israelite,

525
00:30:09.005 --> 00:30:13.305
who fully trusts in and fully obedient to his God.

526
00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:17.885
And here's what that means. All

527
00:30:17.885 --> 00:30:21.045
of these kings in Israel's history that we will see in one

528
00:30:21.045 --> 00:30:23.245
and two Samuel that we'll see throughout the rest,

529
00:30:23.435 --> 00:30:27.645
they were all but shadows of the true king that was

530
00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:30.365
to come whose name is Jesus.

531
00:30:31.795 --> 00:30:35.885
They were contrast to what he would come to do perfectly,

532
00:30:36.895 --> 00:30:41.485
where he would come listen to serve, not to be served,

533
00:30:42.925 --> 00:30:47.435
where he would come and die for those who disappointed him,

534
00:30:47.815 --> 00:30:51.355
not attack those who disappointed him, where he would come

535
00:30:52.295 --> 00:30:56.355
to give to others rather than take from others.

536
00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:04.375
And listen, it's the same thing for every other king

537
00:31:04.375 --> 00:31:08.825
that you and I pursue in our daily lives, those

538
00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:11.945
that we choose to follow, those that promise happiness

539
00:31:12.125 --> 00:31:14.225
but only end up taking from us.

540
00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:18.345
This God is an all together different king.

541
00:31:21.155 --> 00:31:24.015
He was faithful to Israel even when they were

542
00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:25.095
not faithful to him.

543
00:31:26.915 --> 00:31:30.335
And he is faithful to us. Even today. He is faithful.

544
00:31:30.435 --> 00:31:32.535
And here's how he proved it through the cross

545
00:31:32.835 --> 00:31:36.895
of Jesus Christ, the ultimate display of God's love

546
00:31:37.035 --> 00:31:40.135
and God's faithfulness, the ultimate giving of

547
00:31:40.135 --> 00:31:41.175
what we truly needed.

548
00:31:41.365 --> 00:31:42.735
It's found there

549
00:31:43.685 --> 00:31:47.335
only Listen church.

550
00:31:47.515 --> 00:31:52.195
That's why. That's why we can lean back

551
00:31:52.335 --> 00:31:54.875
off the rock face and say, God, you got this.

552
00:31:57.095 --> 00:31:58.475
And we don't have to try to climb

553
00:31:58.735 --> 00:32:00.315
and find our foothold and our handle.

554
00:32:00.315 --> 00:32:04.435
We don't have to because God is the one holding us.

555
00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:11.475
He's a good king. And so let's worship him.

556
00:32:11.945 --> 00:32:13.475
He's worthy of it.

557
00:32:13.575 --> 00:32:18.235
God, thank you that we can,

558
00:32:19.135 --> 00:32:24.035
we can lean back the way you say it,

559
00:32:24.035 --> 00:32:28.395
Jesus, Matthew 11 is we can rest John 15,

560
00:32:28.495 --> 00:32:29.555
we can abide

561
00:32:35.225 --> 00:32:39.765
knowing that you give us life abundantly.

562
00:32:43.265 --> 00:32:45.605
So God, I pray that we would not have any conditions,

563
00:32:46.305 --> 00:32:50.725
not have any exceptions on us just leaning back in life,

564
00:32:51.875 --> 00:32:53.365
whether it's a sin issue,

565
00:32:53.435 --> 00:32:56.485
whether it's a wrong focus in our lives,

566
00:32:56.485 --> 00:32:57.725
whether it's a trust

567
00:32:57.745 --> 00:33:00.645
and a hope that we have this thing that's a felt need

568
00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:03.845
and we're looking for something to fulfill that God, all of

569
00:33:03.845 --> 00:33:05.445
that, may we lean back in you

570
00:33:07.545 --> 00:33:10.725
and just trust that you have us

571
00:33:11.625 --> 00:33:13.885
as our good perfect king.

572
00:33:14.945 --> 00:33:18.325
Giving and giving and giving to us.

573
00:33:21.835 --> 00:33:23.285
Lord, it's gonna take some courage.

574
00:33:23.485 --> 00:33:25.325
I know for some in this room, as we heard

575
00:33:25.325 --> 00:33:28.765
before, as I've experienced in my life some courage to say,

576
00:33:28.835 --> 00:33:32.325
okay, God, this one's yours, and open our hands.

577
00:33:32.865 --> 00:33:36.045
Let you have it Because you do.

578
00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:41.765
Nothing's too strong for you. You are the rock.

579
00:33:43.185 --> 00:33:45.445
As as Hannah prayed in one Samuel two,

580
00:33:45.495 --> 00:33:47.485
there is no rock like our God.

581
00:33:48.295 --> 00:33:51.285
There is no other king like our king.

582
00:33:53.635 --> 00:33:57.045
Lead us to you, God, not only to sing,

583
00:33:57.305 --> 00:33:59.085
but also to live for your glory.

584
00:33:59.105 --> 00:34:00.005
In Jesus' name.
