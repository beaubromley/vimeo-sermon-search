00:00:01.285 --> 00:00:03.615
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:06.815
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:09.575
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:13.935
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:17.095
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:28.215
Good morning. I know it's

7
00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:29.375
raining and I know you guys are tired.

8
00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:31.135
Uh, we're gonna try that one more time

9
00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:33.415
'cause uh, I frankly, I've got 30 more minutes and,

10
00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:34.735
and that's a awful way to start.

11
00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:38.215
Let's go. Good morning. Yeah.

12
00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:41.855
See now the, the wet feet are paying off, aren't they? Yeah.

13
00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:43.375
Uh, I'm Phil Ali.

14
00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:45.415
I'm the pastor of discipleship and community,

15
00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:47.295
and God called me to Henderson Hills

16
00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:51.215
to help create a culture of discipleship.

17
00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:53.255
And I can't think of a better place to serve.

18
00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:54.735
I'm honored to serve you here.

19
00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:57.735
And so I wanna start by saying thank you to Pastor John,

20
00:00:57.755 --> 00:00:58.775
our lead teaching pastor

21
00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:02.055
and our elders for giving me the opportunity, the privilege

22
00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:05.415
and honor of addressing you about Psalm 71.

23
00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:08.375
So, uh, turning your Bibles to Psalm 71.

24
00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:11.455
While you're doing that, uh, we're gonna multitask here.

25
00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:14.655
How many by raise of hand would say

26
00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:18.695
that you've ever tried something and failed miserably?

27
00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:22.055
Go ahead. I see that hand. I see that hand.

28
00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:25.175
Uh, that's my, um, Billy Graham.

29
00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:27.975
If you came in a bus, the bus will wait.

30
00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:30.735
We've all made mistakes

31
00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:34.175
and we've all, even if they're accidental,

32
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.735
we've just blown it.

33
00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:38.455
And what happens then, as a result, is

34
00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:40.215
that we have this fear of failure

35
00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:42.375
and mistakes that cause us

36
00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:45.055
to hold back when God is calling us

37
00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:46.495
somewhere to do something.

38
00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:47.895
And how many of you have,

39
00:01:47.895 --> 00:01:50.175
and you don't have to raise your hand on this one, how many

40
00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:55.095
of you secretly or regretfully thought if I only,

41
00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.615
or if I never, or, or why didn't I

42
00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:03.735
or if I had only, well, I've got really good news

43
00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:05.415
for you today in Psalm 71.

44
00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:08.695
What if you could start and stay

45
00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.335
and finish strong?

46
00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:14.015
And that's, uh, that's exactly

47
00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:16.055
where this passage is taking us today.

48
00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:17.655
Uh, I wanna start with a story.

49
00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:19.215
I'm gonna only tell one story today,

50
00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:20.615
but it's gonna come in three spots.

51
00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:23.335
It was February, 2022.

52
00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:26.455
And a, an ice storm had just blown through North Dallas.

53
00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:27.775
In fact, it came all the way through.

54
00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:30.335
And you guys, many of you got the, the day off,

55
00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:31.375
if not the week off.

56
00:02:31.995 --> 00:02:33.815
And so I was sitting at home

57
00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:36.735
and I was sitting in my recliner and I had my pajamas on.

58
00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:39.575
I had a cup of coffee. I just finished my quiet time.

59
00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:43.135
I was thinking, man, I'm so sorry for this ice,

60
00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:44.975
but sure is nice to have a day off.

61
00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:48.055
And, and then I hear this knock, knock, knock,

62
00:02:48.055 --> 00:02:49.335
knock on the drywall,

63
00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:52.775
and I immediately know what's happened.

64
00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:56.855
And, uh, best case scenario, I went to my wife

65
00:02:56.855 --> 00:02:58.735
and I said, Hey Carol, were you knocking on the drywall?

66
00:02:58.735 --> 00:03:00.045
For some reason she said, no.

67
00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:03.085
And some of you don't know this, but my mother, she's 89

68
00:03:03.145 --> 00:03:05.085
and she's had dementia, lived with us

69
00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:06.405
for the last eight years.

70
00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:09.525
And, uh, it was her knocking on the wall.

71
00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:11.765
And when I heard her knocking on the wall, I knew

72
00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:13.725
that she had fallen and broken her hip.

73
00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:15.885
And so I went into her room

74
00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:17.485
and sure enough, she was laying on the floor.

75
00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:19.925
And I said, mom, what happened? She goes, I don't know.

76
00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:21.005
And I said, can you get up?

77
00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:22.325
And she goes, no, I can't get up.

78
00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:25.445
And so, uh, I had to call the, uh, ambulance.

79
00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.965
Uh, what pastors normally do is they, they network

80
00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:29.805
with one another and they get a good deal.

81
00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:33.125
And so, uh, we know which hospital we're going to

82
00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:34.365
and we know how we're gonna get there.

83
00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:35.405
Great big ambulance.

84
00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:37.845
I remember one of the eight, uh, one

85
00:03:37.845 --> 00:03:40.925
of the ambulance guys falling down because it was icy.

86
00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:41.925
And, and they're trying to get

87
00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:43.045
my mom down and he falls down.

88
00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:44.405
We get into this thing

89
00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:47.285
and we're, we're driving down the North Dallas hallway.

90
00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:50.045
And at one point we kind of started sliding this way

91
00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:51.445
and I was thinking, oh great.

92
00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:53.965
My mom's got a broken hip. We're on an icy road.

93
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.605
I'm gonna be in an accident on North Delta. Holy.

94
00:03:56.225 --> 00:03:58.325
And that's what happens to us when we're in the middle

95
00:03:58.325 --> 00:04:00.285
of a storm, we begin to think in terms

96
00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:01.525
of worst case scenarios

97
00:04:01.665 --> 00:04:03.645
and we forget that we have a God who's in charge.

98
00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:06.485
And so, uh, I get to the er

99
00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:08.245
and of course there's very few people there

100
00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:09.805
because the city's literally shut down.

101
00:04:10.225 --> 00:04:12.085
And I know my mom's hip is broken.

102
00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.565
And we tried to get a doctor there.

103
00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:16.725
And while we're getting ready for a doctor to arrive to,

104
00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:19.805
to give us some instructions, I began

105
00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:21.205
to have a conversation with the Lord.

106
00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:24.605
And I said, God, you know her.

107
00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:28.125
And you know, she gave her life for me.

108
00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:32.485
And my brother, my dad, she, she served selflessly.

109
00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:35.365
She, uh, she cared

110
00:04:35.385 --> 00:04:38.365
for my brother when he had multiple sclerosis for 16 years.

111
00:04:40.105 --> 00:04:41.565
And now she's got dementia

112
00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:44.005
and she's fallen and broken her hip.

113
00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:46.365
God, what are you trying to do here?

114
00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:50.125
And I think it's okay to ask God questions. He's big enough.

115
00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:52.485
This is a psalm of lament.

116
00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.085
Many of the lament psalms ask similar questions.

117
00:04:56.705 --> 00:04:58.805
And so we're gonna come back to that story in a minute.

118
00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:02.845
But, but at every stage in life, there are storms that come.

119
00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:06.165
Teenage students, uh, seemingly I always preach right

120
00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:07.325
before school's about to get started.

121
00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:09.965
And so are you excited about getting back to school

122
00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:14.125
and fitting in and, uh, facing exclusion or isolation?

123
00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:15.725
What about the anxieties

124
00:05:15.745 --> 00:05:19.405
and pressures of finishing with a high GPA so

125
00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:21.125
that you can have a college of your choice?

126
00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:22.805
And what about single young adults?

127
00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:25.725
Are you concerned about finding a fulfilling calling

128
00:05:25.865 --> 00:05:28.525
and maybe, um, serving in a way

129
00:05:28.525 --> 00:05:30.405
that you didn't feel like you were in a dead end job?

130
00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:33.605
And what if you could start and stay

131
00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:35.805
and finish strong, married, young adults?

132
00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:38.245
Are you facing any financial pressures?

133
00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:40.605
Are you managing student loans and rent

134
00:05:40.605 --> 00:05:42.285
and mortgage payments and credit card debt?

135
00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:45.285
Do you have any anxiety about maybe getting your bills paid

136
00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:46.405
from month to month?

137
00:05:47.255 --> 00:05:48.595
You worry about losing a job?

138
00:05:50.335 --> 00:05:52.065
What if you could start and stay

139
00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:55.515
and finish strong median age adults?

140
00:05:56.175 --> 00:05:58.405
Are you ever worried about providing for your family

141
00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:01.085
or do you worry about being able to give the kind of energy

142
00:06:01.185 --> 00:06:02.445
and passion to your marriage

143
00:06:02.465 --> 00:06:03.885
to make it work the way it should?

144
00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:07.485
What about worrying about losing your job

145
00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:09.525
or not being able to advance in your career

146
00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:11.645
or not being able to support yourself in retirement?

147
00:06:11.645 --> 00:06:13.005
Which brings us to senior adults.

148
00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:17.325
This psalm is written from the perspective

149
00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:18.685
of a senior adult man.

150
00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:21.485
I can't for the life of me figure out why they give it

151
00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:26.245
to me, but this psalm is recorded

152
00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:29.085
in a unique voice of someone who's growing older,

153
00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:31.525
someone whose capacities mental and physical

154
00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:34.445
and relational capacities are beginning to to weaken.

155
00:06:34.465 --> 00:06:38.205
And so with this declining health and loss of independence

156
00:06:38.205 --> 00:06:39.965
and maybe the death of a spouse,

157
00:06:40.755 --> 00:06:43.925
what if retirement just gives you more time for worry

158
00:06:44.065 --> 00:06:46.445
and anxiety and boredom and loneliness

159
00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:48.165
and discouragement and frustration?

160
00:06:49.915 --> 00:06:53.045
What if you could start strong and stay strong

161
00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:54.405
and finish strong?

162
00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:59.245
Well, the psalmist and Psalm 71 gives us an encouraging word

163
00:06:59.515 --> 00:07:01.885
from a lifetime of experience.

164
00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:06.685
And we know because we live in a fallen world that life

165
00:07:06.745 --> 00:07:09.005
as we know it is a test of our faith.

166
00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:13.645
In Jesus said in John 1633, I've said these things to you

167
00:07:13.645 --> 00:07:17.045
that in me, you might have peace in the world,

168
00:07:17.185 --> 00:07:20.165
you will have tribulation that can also be, uh,

169
00:07:20.235 --> 00:07:24.445
interpreted trouble or pressure or affliction or distress.

170
00:07:24.985 --> 00:07:29.325
But take hearts is the amen moment. Prepare, but take heart.

171
00:07:29.885 --> 00:07:31.085
I have overcome the world.

172
00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:34.445
So before we get started, I wanna read

173
00:07:34.445 --> 00:07:35.885
to you a beautiful passage from

174
00:07:35.885 --> 00:07:37.685
Gerald Wilson about the Psalms.

175
00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:41.325
Picture yourself as one of a crowd packed together

176
00:07:41.325 --> 00:07:42.685
with thousands of others, shoulder

177
00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:44.205
to shoulder, elbow to elbow.

178
00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:48.285
Experiencing this as one common event there

179
00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:51.965
in the air is a sense of excitement and anticipation.

180
00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:53.725
The sense of common purpose

181
00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:56.605
and experience draws the whole crowd together.

182
00:07:56.705 --> 00:08:00.485
As you respond to the events of the moment in this setting,

183
00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:03.205
you discover that your individual response becomes a part

184
00:08:03.205 --> 00:08:06.645
of something larger just outside yourself as you react

185
00:08:07.065 --> 00:08:10.485
to community of the joys and the sorrows and the victories

186
00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:12.925
and defeats that are acted out before you.

187
00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:16.955
Now as you've come to your senses, you're beginning

188
00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.435
to understand what reading of the book

189
00:08:19.435 --> 00:08:22.115
of Psalms is all about For whatever,

190
00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.995
whenever we crack open this biblical book

191
00:08:24.015 --> 00:08:27.035
and read from its collection of 150 songs,

192
00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:28.995
whenever we allow ourselves

193
00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:33.075
to truly be immersed in the world they bring to life,

194
00:08:33.165 --> 00:08:36.635
we're taking our stand with a huge crowd of the faithful

195
00:08:36.815 --> 00:08:39.555
who have sung these psalms throughout the generations.

196
00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:43.355
Whenever you sing them or pray them, you're praying

197
00:08:43.455 --> 00:08:46.675
and singing and reading alongside a huge crowd

198
00:08:46.695 --> 00:08:47.915
of faithful witnesses.

199
00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:51.475
Throughout the ages, the words

200
00:08:51.475 --> 00:08:54.515
that you speak have been spoken thousands, even millions

201
00:08:54.515 --> 00:08:58.445
of times before in Hebrew, in Greek, in Latin, in English,

202
00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:00.285
and a myriad of other languages.

203
00:09:00.865 --> 00:09:04.125
As you read or pray off to your right stands, Moses

204
00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.325
and David and Solomon.

205
00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:09.805
And to your left is Jesus and Peter and Paul.

206
00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:14.445
And behind you are Saint Augustine and Luther and Calvin.

207
00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:16.885
If you can catch a glimpse

208
00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:20.125
of this far-flung spiritual community of believers

209
00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:23.045
and take your place within it, then you can begin

210
00:09:23.045 --> 00:09:25.605
to understand why we still sing and pray

211
00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:27.165
and read the book of Psalms.

212
00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:31.125
You're taking a stand with believers, past, present,

213
00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:35.085
and future who together sing the songs of celebration

214
00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:37.365
of a steadfast love of God.

215
00:09:38.305 --> 00:09:41.965
And with that, we start Psalm 71, how do you start

216
00:09:41.985 --> 00:09:43.245
and stay and finish strong?

217
00:09:43.245 --> 00:09:45.205
First you make God your home,

218
00:09:45.715 --> 00:09:48.405
make God your home 71, 1 in you.

219
00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:50.165
Oh Lord, I take refuge

220
00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:53.805
that word refuge can be also interpreted.

221
00:09:53.915 --> 00:09:55.565
Shelter or dwelling place.

222
00:09:55.865 --> 00:09:58.965
You make God your home because he is your rescuer.

223
00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:02.685
Look at verse two, verse one in you, oh Lord, I take refuge.

224
00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:04.805
Let me never be put to shame. Verse two.

225
00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:07.965
And, and in your righteousness might be the hinge

226
00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:11.125
of the entire Psalm in your righteousness.

227
00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:13.165
Deliver me and rescue me.

228
00:10:14.355 --> 00:10:16.565
Incline your ear to me and save me.

229
00:10:17.025 --> 00:10:20.165
So God is our refuge and God is our rescue.

230
00:10:20.465 --> 00:10:23.965
But this rescue is based upon his righteousness.

231
00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:26.045
It's not anything the psalmist has done.

232
00:10:26.275 --> 00:10:28.485
It's not in the psalmist circumstances

233
00:10:28.785 --> 00:10:30.485
and it's not in the opinions of others.

234
00:10:30.545 --> 00:10:35.365
And what they think of the psalmist rescue is found in God's

235
00:10:35.365 --> 00:10:36.765
righteousness alone.

236
00:10:37.755 --> 00:10:41.965
Another way to say that is God's rescue is the function

237
00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:43.445
of his righteousness.

238
00:10:44.345 --> 00:10:47.245
And that's why we go to him and make him our home.

239
00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:50.245
He is our rock of refuge. Look at verse three.

240
00:10:51.665 --> 00:10:55.805
Be to me a rock of refuge in which I may continually come.

241
00:10:56.545 --> 00:10:59.405
You've given the command to save me, and you are my rock

242
00:10:59.405 --> 00:11:02.805
and my fortress rescue me, oh my God, from the hand

243
00:11:02.805 --> 00:11:05.605
of the wicked, from the grass of the unjust

244
00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:06.965
and the cruel man.

245
00:11:07.505 --> 00:11:09.125
See, God was the strong

246
00:11:09.225 --> 00:11:12.965
and permanent home for this psalmist's soul.

247
00:11:13.445 --> 00:11:16.605
A place where he could continually come and find safety

248
00:11:16.865 --> 00:11:18.485
and strength and protection.

249
00:11:18.965 --> 00:11:21.445
A storm shelter, that's what preaches in Oklahoma.

250
00:11:21.505 --> 00:11:24.605
By the way, anytime he says, we used to say Fredy hole,

251
00:11:24.605 --> 00:11:26.325
but then somehow it, it got uncool.

252
00:11:26.445 --> 00:11:29.805
I can't imagine a strong storm.

253
00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:33.045
Shelter a fortress if you will make God your home.

254
00:11:33.045 --> 00:11:34.845
Number two, make God your hope.

255
00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:36.605
Look at verses five through eight.

256
00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:37.925
If you wanna start and stay

257
00:11:37.925 --> 00:11:40.845
and finish strong, make God your hope for you.

258
00:11:40.865 --> 00:11:43.805
Oh Lord, are my hope, my trust.

259
00:11:44.385 --> 00:11:46.685
You have to believe that God is trustworthy.

260
00:11:46.945 --> 00:11:48.085
And number two, you have

261
00:11:48.085 --> 00:11:51.165
to believe God is faithful my trust, oh Lord,

262
00:11:51.165 --> 00:11:52.805
from my youth upon you.

263
00:11:52.955 --> 00:11:55.445
I've learned from before my birth you

264
00:11:56.305 --> 00:11:57.965
who took me from my mother's womb.

265
00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.405
My praise is continually of you.

266
00:12:01.985 --> 00:12:05.485
And so he is faithful and I can trust that.

267
00:12:05.745 --> 00:12:08.765
And there is where I put my hope. Look at verse seven.

268
00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:12.365
This is, this is a stunning verse for I have been

269
00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:15.885
as important to many for you are my strong refuge.

270
00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:18.605
We have to explain that phrase as important.

271
00:12:19.065 --> 00:12:22.765
In the King James. It says a wonder in the NASB,

272
00:12:22.765 --> 00:12:24.165
it says as a marvel.

273
00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:25.845
And what's happening here is

274
00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:28.365
because of the things that are happening in the psalmist's

275
00:12:28.365 --> 00:12:29.845
life, 'cause of his weakening

276
00:12:30.005 --> 00:12:32.965
and his frailty, he's beginning to get a reputation

277
00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:35.685
as someone who can't be trusted as a leader.

278
00:12:35.685 --> 00:12:38.645
Any law. I mean, he's, he can't lead, he can't.

279
00:12:38.905 --> 00:12:41.405
Uh, it's at, at the end of your life as you begin to

280
00:12:41.585 --> 00:12:43.845
to suffer the, the, the effects of aging,

281
00:12:44.035 --> 00:12:47.845
then he's getting a reputation for his pain and suffering.

282
00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:50.165
And people were shocked at the troubles

283
00:12:50.165 --> 00:12:51.205
this old man was facing.

284
00:12:51.745 --> 00:12:53.045
So much so that they thought

285
00:12:53.045 --> 00:12:54.925
that perhaps God had abandoned him.

286
00:12:56.105 --> 00:12:57.645
But even in his old age.

287
00:12:57.865 --> 00:13:00.605
And, and guys, uh, as I studied this,

288
00:13:00.605 --> 00:13:02.085
this just filled me with hope.

289
00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:03.765
Even in his old age.

290
00:13:04.705 --> 00:13:08.525
He wanted, he still wanted to be an example of how to live.

291
00:13:09.425 --> 00:13:11.405
And he wasn't going to be defined by

292
00:13:11.405 --> 00:13:12.525
what people thought of him.

293
00:13:13.145 --> 00:13:15.765
And he understood that God was his strong refuge,

294
00:13:15.945 --> 00:13:18.365
his dwelling place, his shelter, his home.

295
00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:21.365
And so his strong refuge was a strong enough

296
00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:22.885
place to find safety.

297
00:13:23.145 --> 00:13:26.005
And that's why he would continually go back.

298
00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:29.405
My mouth look, says in verse eight, my mouth is filled

299
00:13:29.405 --> 00:13:32.565
with your praise, with your glory all the day.

300
00:13:32.565 --> 00:13:35.565
Everybody say all the day. All the day.

301
00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:38.285
Now, the reason I'm asking you to do that week,

302
00:13:38.465 --> 00:13:40.205
by the way, I'm gonna try it again.

303
00:13:41.105 --> 00:13:43.845
Um, the reason I'm asking you is it in this verse three

304
00:13:43.845 --> 00:13:46.765
times, he goes back to that phrase, which reminds us

305
00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:49.125
that we have to continually go back

306
00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:52.085
all the day, all the day.

307
00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:54.325
So when I say how long I want you to say

308
00:13:54.945 --> 00:13:56.445
all the day, how long?

309
00:13:57.225 --> 00:13:59.605
All the day. So that's, that's

310
00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:01.685
what it means when he says I've become a port in, is

311
00:14:01.685 --> 00:14:03.005
that people have seen me

312
00:14:03.145 --> 00:14:05.565
and they wonder, has God abandoned him?

313
00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:10.725
And that's why God in his hope gives me a hopeful voice.

314
00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:13.845
My mouth is filled with praise of your glory. How long?

315
00:14:14.545 --> 00:14:16.965
All the day, let me ask you a question,

316
00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:21.965
which is the best description for your voice right now?

317
00:14:24.445 --> 00:14:25.505
Has it been silenced?

318
00:14:26.935 --> 00:14:30.715
Is it characterized by whining, complaining,

319
00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:32.235
blaming,

320
00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:37.445
crying, or praising?

321
00:14:40.165 --> 00:14:42.505
So how do you star and stay and finish strong?

322
00:14:42.505 --> 00:14:43.505
You make God your home.

323
00:14:43.565 --> 00:14:46.065
You make God your hope and you make God your help.

324
00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:50.305
Look at verse nine. Do not cast me off in time of old age.

325
00:14:50.335 --> 00:14:52.325
Forsake me. Not when my strength is spent

326
00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:54.845
for my enemies speak concerning me.

327
00:14:55.055 --> 00:14:57.485
Those who watch for my life consulting together

328
00:14:57.505 --> 00:15:00.725
and say God has forsaken him, pursue

329
00:15:00.725 --> 00:15:02.845
and seize him for there is none to deliver him.

330
00:15:02.845 --> 00:15:04.845
There's two reasons to lose hope,

331
00:15:05.225 --> 00:15:08.445
but two even better reasons to seek help.

332
00:15:08.945 --> 00:15:11.245
And one is, God, don't forsake me.

333
00:15:11.605 --> 00:15:13.365
Remember, this is what Jesus said on the cross.

334
00:15:13.635 --> 00:15:15.125
He's thinking, I'm getting old.

335
00:15:15.305 --> 00:15:17.245
I'm being attacked by those who come around me.

336
00:15:17.645 --> 00:15:20.365
I need your help. But number two, God,

337
00:15:20.495 --> 00:15:22.285
don't be far away from me.

338
00:15:22.985 --> 00:15:26.325
See as it is the righteousness that provides the rescue,

339
00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:29.045
it's God's presence that provides the power.

340
00:15:29.815 --> 00:15:34.725
Verse 12, may God your hope, oh God, do not be far from me.

341
00:15:35.345 --> 00:15:38.005
Oh my God, make haste to help me.

342
00:15:38.585 --> 00:15:40.325
May my accusers be put to shame

343
00:15:40.345 --> 00:15:42.685
and consumed with scorn and disgrace.

344
00:15:42.865 --> 00:15:47.645
May they be covered. Those who seek my hurt, God,

345
00:15:47.645 --> 00:15:49.205
don't be far away from me.

346
00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:53.725
Help me quickly. Help me completely for I face danger.

347
00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:58.365
And I I I refuse to not be anchored

348
00:15:58.365 --> 00:16:02.205
to you when the storm winds blow rather than weakening his

349
00:16:02.335 --> 00:16:06.205
faith, these trials are strengthening his faith.

350
00:16:08.615 --> 00:16:10.235
So I'm sitting in the ER with my mom

351
00:16:10.295 --> 00:16:14.195
and it's a horrible ice storm and there's no doctors there.

352
00:16:14.215 --> 00:16:16.435
And while we're waiting for a doctor to come

353
00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:18.875
to evaluate the x-rays, they've already taken,

354
00:16:19.235 --> 00:16:23.975
I have eight hours in the ER with my mom and she's sedated.

355
00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:26.535
And so she gets to sleep and I just have to sit there.

356
00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:27.935
And I wasn't prepared.

357
00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:30.295
I did take my phone and I look on my phone

358
00:16:30.675 --> 00:16:32.415
and I get a text from my daughter

359
00:16:32.795 --> 00:16:35.015
and she doesn't know I'm sitting in the ER

360
00:16:35.015 --> 00:16:36.095
with her grandmother.

361
00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:39.095
And it's just a simple little link

362
00:16:39.095 --> 00:16:43.855
and it says, uh, hhbc.com jobs.

363
00:16:47.365 --> 00:16:49.825
I'm not looking, I'm at a great church in Texas.

364
00:16:50.365 --> 00:16:52.385
Uh, I'm doing, uh, exactly

365
00:16:52.415 --> 00:16:53.985
what I believe God is wanting me to do.

366
00:16:54.325 --> 00:16:56.985
Uh, but God somehow gets my attention that day

367
00:16:57.365 --> 00:16:58.785
and I've got nothing but time.

368
00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:01.185
And I look at this website

369
00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:03.065
and uh, I see the very first

370
00:17:03.065 --> 00:17:04.345
thing is the mission and vision.

371
00:17:04.725 --> 00:17:07.465
We equip one another to love Jesus and live sin.

372
00:17:08.385 --> 00:17:11.185
I thought that's, that's a great vision

373
00:17:11.605 --> 00:17:12.825
and that's a great mission.

374
00:17:13.245 --> 00:17:14.785
So I go on to the mission statement

375
00:17:14.785 --> 00:17:19.545
and it says that we are, uh, creating a culture, a, a, uh,

376
00:17:19.885 --> 00:17:21.865
to become a hub of discipleship.

377
00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:23.865
And then I look over at the job description

378
00:17:23.865 --> 00:17:25.985
and it's for the pastor of discipleship and community.

379
00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:28.705
And they're like, they want a pastor of discipleship

380
00:17:29.325 --> 00:17:32.825
to help them accomplish the mission of making disciples.

381
00:17:34.335 --> 00:17:35.655
I dunno, what's this culture all about?

382
00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:38.295
So I start reading these core values

383
00:17:38.835 --> 00:17:41.735
and each time I read a core value, I begin to think more

384
00:17:41.735 --> 00:17:44.415
and more, you know what, that sounds like a great place

385
00:17:44.755 --> 00:17:45.815
to serve Jesus.

386
00:17:47.515 --> 00:17:50.405
And so for the first time I'm thinking, what if God

387
00:17:50.985 --> 00:17:54.525
is opening a door for me to go to Edmond

388
00:17:54.545 --> 00:17:56.925
to serve at a church that wants to make disciples?

389
00:17:58.065 --> 00:17:59.405
It just happens to be a few miles

390
00:17:59.435 --> 00:18:00.725
away from my granddaughters.

391
00:18:00.825 --> 00:18:03.245
So, you know, I mean that's a part of the equation.

392
00:18:03.325 --> 00:18:05.725
I get to see my daughter, my son lives in Oklahoma City.

393
00:18:05.725 --> 00:18:07.725
It's gonna be easier to be closer to them.

394
00:18:09.925 --> 00:18:12.505
How do you start and stay strong and finish strong?

395
00:18:12.505 --> 00:18:14.665
Will you? Number four, you make God your hope.

396
00:18:15.325 --> 00:18:17.465
Now, some of you're thinking, oh, that's too bad.

397
00:18:17.525 --> 00:18:19.345
The old man forgot. He's already said hope.

398
00:18:20.645 --> 00:18:22.225
As a matter of fact, when I submitted my notes,

399
00:18:22.565 --> 00:18:25.025
pastor John said, Hey, did you mean to say hope twice?

400
00:18:25.135 --> 00:18:26.825
Just so you know he's looking out for you.

401
00:18:29.485 --> 00:18:33.955
But the text drives this. Let's read it in verse 14.

402
00:18:34.255 --> 00:18:38.435
But I will hope continually, continually means

403
00:18:38.435 --> 00:18:43.355
that I gotta go back for more hope as the world is,

404
00:18:43.835 --> 00:18:46.035
I feel these storms blow.

405
00:18:46.315 --> 00:18:48.235
I feel the darkness come around,

406
00:18:48.655 --> 00:18:52.235
but I need you to know that continually and increasingly

407
00:18:52.495 --> 00:18:56.395
and emphatically sometimes each day, each hour, each minute,

408
00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:58.915
each breath and each thought, I have

409
00:18:58.915 --> 00:19:00.675
to come back again for hope.

410
00:19:02.255 --> 00:19:05.435
And this psalmist expresses this hope, this continual,

411
00:19:05.465 --> 00:19:08.915
this increasing emphatic hope in a sovereign God

412
00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:10.235
that he can be trusted.

413
00:19:11.575 --> 00:19:14.275
And his praise tells us that the character of God

414
00:19:14.335 --> 00:19:17.315
and the acts of God serve as the basis of hope,

415
00:19:17.655 --> 00:19:19.035
as the reason for his praise.

416
00:19:19.615 --> 00:19:21.275
How do you make God your hope?

417
00:19:21.275 --> 00:19:23.355
While I will hope continually. Verse 15.

418
00:19:23.655 --> 00:19:26.235
And my mouth will tell of your righteous acts,

419
00:19:26.535 --> 00:19:27.995
of your deeds of salvation.

420
00:19:28.255 --> 00:19:30.515
How long all the day

421
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.875
for their number is past my knowledge,

422
00:19:35.145 --> 00:19:37.195
what I'm learning in my sixties?

423
00:19:37.535 --> 00:19:39.875
Yes, it's true teenagers, someone lives that long,

424
00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:44.595
that the longer you live, the lower your trials,

425
00:19:45.135 --> 00:19:48.195
the more your praises must increase as well.

426
00:19:48.895 --> 00:19:50.875
That's how you make God your hope.

427
00:19:51.265 --> 00:19:53.715
Look at verse 16, there's three ways to do it.

428
00:19:53.855 --> 00:19:57.115
And one is by proclaiming him with the mighty deeds

429
00:19:57.115 --> 00:19:58.475
of the Lord, I will come and I'll

430
00:19:58.475 --> 00:19:59.755
remind them of your righteousness.

431
00:19:59.885 --> 00:20:02.835
Yours alone, oh God, from my youth, you've taught me

432
00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:05.035
and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.

433
00:20:05.735 --> 00:20:07.195
So even in my old age

434
00:20:07.215 --> 00:20:10.235
and gray hairs, oh God, do not forsake me

435
00:20:10.605 --> 00:20:14.195
until I proclaim your might to another generation.

436
00:20:14.425 --> 00:20:18.835
Your power to all who come. I proclaim your mighty deeds.

437
00:20:19.155 --> 00:20:21.995
I proclaim your righteousness. I proclaim your power.

438
00:20:22.505 --> 00:20:25.195
This man can't keep quiet about God's greatness.

439
00:20:26.445 --> 00:20:28.585
He proclaimed that God could be trusted

440
00:20:28.845 --> 00:20:31.065
to take wrong things and make them right.

441
00:20:31.245 --> 00:20:32.745
And this is what I love about old age.

442
00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:34.825
And there's not a ton of things, but this is one of them.

443
00:20:36.845 --> 00:20:38.265
He can look back and say, you know what?

444
00:20:38.325 --> 00:20:40.665
God has been trustworthy since my youth.

445
00:20:42.005 --> 00:20:45.625
God is trustworthy right now, whatever age I am,

446
00:20:46.045 --> 00:20:47.885
and God will be trustworthy even

447
00:20:47.895 --> 00:20:49.445
until my old age in gray hair.

448
00:20:52.505 --> 00:20:54.085
So you do it by proclaiming him

449
00:20:54.085 --> 00:20:56.245
and then you do it by pursuing him.

450
00:20:56.695 --> 00:20:58.725
Verse 19, your righteousness,

451
00:20:58.745 --> 00:21:01.805
oh God reaches the high heavens, you've done great things.

452
00:21:01.945 --> 00:21:04.805
Oh God, great question. It's a rhetorical question.

453
00:21:04.985 --> 00:21:07.525
You don't have to answer this question. It answers itself.

454
00:21:07.865 --> 00:21:10.245
Oh God, who is like you?

455
00:21:11.955 --> 00:21:14.575
You've made me see many troubles and calamities,

456
00:21:14.915 --> 00:21:18.295
and you revive me again from the depths of the earth,

457
00:21:18.515 --> 00:21:19.575
you will bring me up again.

458
00:21:19.575 --> 00:21:23.935
So you revive me, you rise me in verse 21, you restore me,

459
00:21:24.275 --> 00:21:27.935
you'll increase my greatness and comfort me again.

460
00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:32.505
Number five, how do you start strong

461
00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:33.985
and stay strong and finish strong?

462
00:21:34.525 --> 00:21:37.785
You don't just make God your home and your hope

463
00:21:38.085 --> 00:21:40.785
and your help, you make God your hymn.

464
00:21:41.525 --> 00:21:43.105
Now a hymn is a song of praise.

465
00:21:43.885 --> 00:21:46.185
By the way, those of us with gray hairs, we know

466
00:21:46.185 --> 00:21:48.385
what the hymns are and we were raised on the hymns.

467
00:21:48.405 --> 00:21:50.545
And that's the only words that we can remember

468
00:21:50.645 --> 00:21:51.665
to the songs that we sing.

469
00:21:51.665 --> 00:21:53.105
And so we really like the hymns.

470
00:21:53.565 --> 00:21:55.345
But but hymn means more than just

471
00:21:55.345 --> 00:21:56.945
what you read in the Baptist hymnal.

472
00:21:57.265 --> 00:22:00.825
Hymn means any song of praise, any anthem

473
00:22:00.825 --> 00:22:02.145
that describes his greatness.

474
00:22:02.265 --> 00:22:03.945
Look what it says in verse 22.

475
00:22:04.465 --> 00:22:07.345
I will also praise with a harp for your faithfulness.

476
00:22:07.885 --> 00:22:10.065
So I celebrate your faithfulness with a harp.

477
00:22:10.765 --> 00:22:13.425
Oh my God, I will sing praises to you with a liar.

478
00:22:13.805 --> 00:22:16.705
Oh holy one of Israel, another stringed instrument.

479
00:22:17.025 --> 00:22:20.225
I celebrate his holiness with a liar.

480
00:22:21.645 --> 00:22:23.425
And then the rest of it is done with his,

481
00:22:23.445 --> 00:22:24.665
uh, his best instrument.

482
00:22:24.725 --> 00:22:28.425
And that is with his mouth, with my lips will shout

483
00:22:28.425 --> 00:22:31.625
for joy when I sing praises to you, my soul also,

484
00:22:31.835 --> 00:22:33.065
which you have redeemed.

485
00:22:33.445 --> 00:22:35.105
And my talk will come

486
00:22:35.205 --> 00:22:37.425
and my tongue will talk of your righteous help.

487
00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:42.025
How long, all day long where they've been put to shame

488
00:22:42.245 --> 00:22:44.825
and disappointed those who sought to do me hurt.

489
00:22:45.565 --> 00:22:47.025
So with shouts of joy

490
00:22:47.485 --> 00:22:51.585
and with shouts of praise, with my lips, with my tongue,

491
00:22:51.585 --> 00:22:54.585
with my, with my mouth, I will praise him.

492
00:22:54.685 --> 00:22:59.665
So we we pursue him and we proclaim him and we praise him.

493
00:23:00.535 --> 00:23:03.505
Well, now we come to the application part of the service.

494
00:23:03.705 --> 00:23:05.065
I can't believe that we were able to get

495
00:23:05.065 --> 00:23:08.385
through 22 verses in 22 minutes and 39 seconds.

496
00:23:09.215 --> 00:23:10.785
This is working out just perfect.

497
00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:14.865
I don't know if you were here that day,

498
00:23:17.395 --> 00:23:20.615
but two years ago in May, I was sitting right here

499
00:23:22.285 --> 00:23:24.545
and uh, pastor John was sitting right here.

500
00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:29.445
And the question was, this guy wants to be our pastor

501
00:23:29.465 --> 00:23:30.805
of discipleship and community.

502
00:23:30.955 --> 00:23:34.755
What do we think about that? Now,

503
00:23:35.905 --> 00:23:37.635
when you are 62 years old

504
00:23:37.635 --> 00:23:38.795
and you're sitting in front of a group

505
00:23:38.795 --> 00:23:40.755
of young people like this and you're thinking to themselves,

506
00:23:41.225 --> 00:23:43.115
they're probably thinking, why is grandpa here?

507
00:23:44.135 --> 00:23:45.485
We wanna be disciple makers.

508
00:23:45.485 --> 00:23:48.145
We we don't wanna be fill in the blank.

509
00:23:49.965 --> 00:23:52.985
And so there, there's this moment in the middle

510
00:23:53.005 --> 00:23:56.705
of life's choices where you have this crisis of belief

511
00:23:57.925 --> 00:23:59.985
and you just have to say, God, I have been able

512
00:23:59.985 --> 00:24:02.585
to trust you, then I'm able to trust you now

513
00:24:02.805 --> 00:24:04.545
and I'll be able to trust you in the future.

514
00:24:06.365 --> 00:24:09.385
And so I remember thinking, God,

515
00:24:09.485 --> 00:24:11.385
are you calling me to serve here?

516
00:24:11.385 --> 00:24:13.465
Well then you're gonna have to convince these people

517
00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:14.945
that I'm the right God.

518
00:24:15.365 --> 00:24:18.665
And then I'm asking, God, can you use me to help this church

519
00:24:19.185 --> 00:24:20.625
discover a disciple making culture?

520
00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:25.945
And, and frankly, I can't think

521
00:24:26.045 --> 00:24:30.905
of a better calling in life as a 64-year-old man

522
00:24:31.055 --> 00:24:35.345
with gray hair to say, when I was a junior high boy, that's

523
00:24:35.345 --> 00:24:36.545
what they used to call middle schoolers.

524
00:24:37.615 --> 00:24:39.265
When I was a junior high boy,

525
00:24:39.405 --> 00:24:41.265
my pa my youth pastor asked me if I wanted

526
00:24:41.265 --> 00:24:42.545
to be a part of an discipleship group.

527
00:24:43.965 --> 00:24:47.625
And now 50 years later, I get to say

528
00:24:47.625 --> 00:24:50.345
to the junior high boys, the middle schoolers, if you will,

529
00:24:51.045 --> 00:24:52.785
Hey, this is a big deal.

530
00:24:53.435 --> 00:24:56.225
Jesus commanded that we do this.

531
00:24:57.055 --> 00:24:58.745
Will you be obedient to this?

532
00:25:00.335 --> 00:25:05.175
And today I'm honored to tell you that you can,

533
00:25:06.375 --> 00:25:08.495
regardless of the life sta stage you're in,

534
00:25:08.835 --> 00:25:12.815
you can start strong and stay strong and finish strong.

535
00:25:13.075 --> 00:25:14.975
The answer is yes you can.

536
00:25:15.235 --> 00:25:18.175
If you make God your home, your refuge, your dwelling place,

537
00:25:18.205 --> 00:25:21.535
your strong shelter, if you make God your hope,

538
00:25:21.995 --> 00:25:24.615
he is trustworthy and faithful all the day.

539
00:25:24.755 --> 00:25:28.255
How long all the day if you make God your help,

540
00:25:28.465 --> 00:25:32.335
God's presence is the answer and he is always near.

541
00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:35.175
If you make God your hope, I will praise him.

542
00:25:35.535 --> 00:25:37.775
I will proclaim Him. I will pursue him.

543
00:25:37.955 --> 00:25:40.935
And if you make God your hymn, he will give you a song

544
00:25:41.075 --> 00:25:44.495
and you will celebrate him as you sing of his righteousness

545
00:25:44.635 --> 00:25:46.135
and his holiness church.

546
00:25:46.475 --> 00:25:49.575
You can, you can, you can.

547
00:25:50.915 --> 00:25:53.745
You also can continue to struggle.

548
00:25:54.765 --> 00:25:58.865
You can continue to stagger on through life, homeless

549
00:25:59.575 --> 00:26:02.065
with no safety, no shelter exposed

550
00:26:02.165 --> 00:26:05.345
and in danger, helpless on your own.

551
00:26:05.465 --> 00:26:06.785
I don't need any help from anybody

552
00:26:08.085 --> 00:26:12.375
and hopeless with no song to sing, don't do it.

553
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:14.855
Choose you this day who you will serve

554
00:26:14.855 --> 00:26:16.295
as from me and my house.

555
00:26:17.305 --> 00:26:18.325
We will serve the Lord.

556
00:26:20.195 --> 00:26:22.575
Our circumstances are not the right way

557
00:26:22.635 --> 00:26:25.095
to assess whether our lives have value

558
00:26:25.155 --> 00:26:26.215
and service to the Lord.

559
00:26:27.235 --> 00:26:31.055
The opinions of others are not a reliable measurement

560
00:26:31.055 --> 00:26:33.295
of whether our value to the Lord is

561
00:26:33.905 --> 00:26:37.015
spent faithfully in obedience and service to him.

562
00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:39.215
Listen to me. The gospel

563
00:26:39.355 --> 00:26:41.975
of Jesus Christ is the only right way

564
00:26:42.195 --> 00:26:45.885
and the only reliable way to measure the value of our lives.

565
00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:49.245
What did he say in Romans five, eight?

566
00:26:49.945 --> 00:26:52.285
But God demonstrated his love for us in this

567
00:26:52.285 --> 00:26:55.525
and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

568
00:26:57.755 --> 00:26:59.095
He showed us how much he loved us

569
00:26:59.605 --> 00:27:01.175
when Christ was on the cross.

570
00:27:01.715 --> 00:27:06.255
He was the example of ultimate victory by all measurements.

571
00:27:06.275 --> 00:27:08.655
The cross of Christ, the circumstances

572
00:27:08.755 --> 00:27:12.255
and the opinions of the passersby could only be described

573
00:27:12.275 --> 00:27:15.815
as a miserable failure, A mocking crown of thorns,

574
00:27:16.775 --> 00:27:20.295
soldiers spitting on and beating on our Jesus, hanging,

575
00:27:20.625 --> 00:27:24.695
humiliated while pastors by hurled insults hands

576
00:27:24.715 --> 00:27:26.575
and feet nailed to the cross.

577
00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:32.195
Yet think about how the suffering servant could die, such

578
00:27:32.195 --> 00:27:35.235
as disgusting criminal's, death on the cross and then

579
00:27:37.385 --> 00:27:41.405
and then and then rise

580
00:27:41.505 --> 00:27:44.405
to become the conquering messiah in the power

581
00:27:44.425 --> 00:27:45.805
of a resurrected life.

582
00:27:46.105 --> 00:27:48.645
For all who believe the gospel

583
00:27:48.745 --> 00:27:52.565
of Jesus Christ is the only way to measure our lives.

584
00:27:53.745 --> 00:27:57.405
At any stage in life, we need to follow God's evaluation

585
00:27:57.405 --> 00:28:00.925
of our lives and overcome the many lying voices

586
00:28:01.235 --> 00:28:02.685
that seek to keep us quiet.

587
00:28:03.105 --> 00:28:05.045
If I'd only, if I never, why didn't I?

588
00:28:05.045 --> 00:28:08.365
If I only had, these lying voices

589
00:28:08.915 --> 00:28:11.605
must be obliterated from our souls.

590
00:28:12.105 --> 00:28:13.245
And we must believe

591
00:28:13.245 --> 00:28:17.285
with the psalmists confidence in your righteousness,

592
00:28:17.915 --> 00:28:19.485
deliver me and rescue me.

593
00:28:20.225 --> 00:28:22.005
Be to me as a rock of refuge

594
00:28:22.145 --> 00:28:25.485
to which I may continually come for you.

595
00:28:25.505 --> 00:28:29.565
Oh Lord, are my hope, my trust, my mouth is filled

596
00:28:29.565 --> 00:28:31.365
with your praise, with your glory.

597
00:28:31.705 --> 00:28:35.445
How long all the day, oh God,

598
00:28:36.455 --> 00:28:37.725
don't be far from me.

599
00:28:38.605 --> 00:28:42.845
I will hope continually and I will praise you yet more

600
00:28:42.945 --> 00:28:45.845
and more and I will remind them of your righteousness.

601
00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:48.885
Yours alone. For you have done great things.

602
00:28:48.985 --> 00:28:53.965
Oh God, who is like you? My lips were shout for joy.

603
00:28:54.755 --> 00:28:57.605
When I sing praises to you, the gospel

604
00:28:57.785 --> 00:29:00.805
of Jesus Christ is the only right way

605
00:29:01.105 --> 00:29:04.285
to reliably measure the value of our lives.

606
00:29:04.755 --> 00:29:08.125
That fact and that fact alone is how you start strong

607
00:29:08.305 --> 00:29:10.085
and stay strong and finish strong.
