00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.455
Good morning church family.

2
00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:24.815
My name is Jimmy Quinn and I get to serve on staff here

3
00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:28.135
and today, get to the privilege

4
00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:30.495
of opening God's word with you all.

5
00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:34.375
One of my responsibilities is to help set the meeting agenda

6
00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:35.975
for our church family meeting

7
00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:37.495
that's happening this afternoon.

8
00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:41.455
And we'd love for you to come. You're invited to come.

9
00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:42.855
It's more than a business meeting.

10
00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:46.255
Uh, it's an opportunity to, to hear where we're headed

11
00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:50.055
as a church, to enjoy being together as a family.

12
00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:51.855
We don't get to do that very often,

13
00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:53.135
so we want to enjoy each other.

14
00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:55.015
And we're gonna hear stories about

15
00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:56.735
what God is doing around us.

16
00:00:56.805 --> 00:01:01.775
Like we heard from Donna and Austin, speaking of Donna

17
00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:03.815
and Austin, uh, Thursday.

18
00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:05.935
Uh, Tuesday is Veterans Day.

19
00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:10.015
And so we want to honor men like Austin and women

20
00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:12.015
and their families who have served

21
00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:13.535
and are serving our country.

22
00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:16.175
So church, can you help thank them for their service.

23
00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:27.415
If you are new to HHBC

24
00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:29.535
or you haven't been here in a while, we've been walking

25
00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:31.135
through the book of f of Second Samuel,

26
00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:32.975
and so we're nearing an end.

27
00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:34.255
So if you have your Bibles, turn

28
00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.095
to Second Samuel chapter 21.

29
00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:40.175
So some scholars believe that, that this section

30
00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:44.175
of Second Samuel is more of an appendix, a thematic summary,

31
00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:46.455
but others view it as kind

32
00:01:46.455 --> 00:01:48.895
of the next chronological step in David's life.

33
00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:50.855
And so today we're gonna,

34
00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:53.695
we're gonna take the latter approach, uh,

35
00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:57.015
that it's just a chronological step in David's life, uh,

36
00:01:57.405 --> 00:01:59.815
primarily because I think we see, uh,

37
00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:03.295
or get the impression that it's near the end of his reign.

38
00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:07.735
So before we dive in, just to kind of give us a, a refresher

39
00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:09.975
of, of where we've been, where we're headed,

40
00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:11.695
we've got our chart, um,

41
00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.935
and we can see here where, where David's rise.

42
00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.695
And then right in the middle, the tragic downfall

43
00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:19.775
of his sin, uh, with Bathsheba.

44
00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.095
And since then, it's just been this downhill trajectory.

45
00:02:23.475 --> 00:02:25.495
And, uh, that last little section,

46
00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:28.055
David's public troubles 20

47
00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:29.775
through 24 is what we're talking about.

48
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:32.375
And there's consequences, both legal, national

49
00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:33.495
and personal consequences.

50
00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:38.455
And so, um, some of those with, uh, David, some

51
00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:40.415
of those consequences that we've seen

52
00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:44.495
and we'll see are family tragedies and, and murders

53
00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:48.615
and sexual immorality happen, rebellion and constant strife.

54
00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:52.615
Last week if you were here, you heard John, uh,

55
00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:53.935
talk about God's mercy

56
00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:55.975
and how it's greater than our past sins.

57
00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:57.615
And if you are a believer in Christ,

58
00:02:57.755 --> 00:03:01.205
he has saved us from our past sins, our present sins

59
00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:03.285
and future sins, and has cleansed

60
00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:04.445
us with the blood of Christ.

61
00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:07.565
He mentioned Romans eight, one, where there is now,

62
00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:10.405
therefore no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus.

63
00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:13.085
And I'm gonna refer to that passage multiple times today

64
00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:16.405
'cause it's such a beautiful hope filled verse.

65
00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:19.605
But that brings us to chapter 21.

66
00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:23.005
And here's our main point today, the consequences

67
00:03:23.305 --> 00:03:24.965
of sin still stings.

68
00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:27.805
I'd like to thank John for giving me this passage

69
00:03:27.985 --> 00:03:30.205
to talk about your sins and their consequences.

70
00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:32.325
I'm kidding. Um,

71
00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:36.525
and so we do know that there are real consequences

72
00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:38.925
for our sin on this side of eternity.

73
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:42.685
So before we begin, I want to, uh, share a story,

74
00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:47.165
a personal story that as I was preparing, um, really

75
00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:49.125
reminded me of, of sin

76
00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.925
and consequences in my personal life growing up.

77
00:03:52.425 --> 00:03:54.845
But before I do, I think we need to give a few,

78
00:03:54.945 --> 00:03:57.725
or I need to give a few, uh, introductory statements.

79
00:03:57.865 --> 00:04:01.965
One, sin is ugly. My sin is ugly.

80
00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:05.805
Your sin is ugly. Our sin is ugly.

81
00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:08.125
Okay, number two, uh,

82
00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:10.005
this happened more than 20 years ago in my life.

83
00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:11.405
Now I say that not

84
00:04:11.405 --> 00:04:15.685
because I've graduated from sinning, that is not the case.

85
00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:18.565
I say that because a sin still grips me today

86
00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:20.685
and I still struggle with sin.

87
00:04:20.985 --> 00:04:24.285
And sometimes my heart is even uglier now than it was then.

88
00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:29.285
Unfortunately, number three, um,

89
00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:34.085
this is not a, an example that should be followed.

90
00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:37.965
So high schoolers, middle schoolers, college students,

91
00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:40.405
this is not a good example.

92
00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:43.005
Don't follow my steps and you'll see why.

93
00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:45.765
And then the fourth thing is, remember

94
00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:47.125
to give grace to sinners, right?

95
00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:49.405
Amen. Thank you. All right.

96
00:04:50.065 --> 00:04:54.365
So in my senior year of high school, my second semester,

97
00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:56.325
I took a class called advanced physics.

98
00:04:57.705 --> 00:04:59.885
Why? I don't know, I still don't know why

99
00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:01.845
I took advanced physics,

100
00:05:01.945 --> 00:05:03.965
but on day one, our teacher said, okay,

101
00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:06.245
here's your syllabus, uh, for the semester.

102
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:08.245
Complete the odd number

103
00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:10.085
of questions at the back of the chapters.

104
00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:11.805
Do chapters one through 30.

105
00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:14.685
And, uh, because you're advanced students,

106
00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:17.165
you have the freedom to do that on your own time.

107
00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:20.965
Great, that sounds awesome. Pretty easy assignment.

108
00:05:21.515 --> 00:05:22.965
Well, as high school boys

109
00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:25.845
or high school seniors, we also had the privilege of

110
00:05:25.905 --> 00:05:27.365
of off-campus lunch.

111
00:05:27.985 --> 00:05:29.285
So it just so happened

112
00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:31.365
that the physics class was right after lunch.

113
00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:34.485
And so let's just say class attendance

114
00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:37.765
was not my strong suit or my buddy's strong suit.

115
00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:42.285
So with about two weeks to go of the semester, my buddies

116
00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:43.925
and I decided to have a study night

117
00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:47.365
to start working on our 30 chapters of physics.

118
00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:50.805
So we get to chapter one

119
00:05:51.065 --> 00:05:54.965
and we realize something advanced physics is hard

120
00:05:55.665 --> 00:05:58.405
and this isn't gonna go very well.

121
00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:01.965
And so after night one, we got one chapter done.

122
00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:05.325
Night two we're, we're getting the hang of it,

123
00:06:05.325 --> 00:06:06.925
we be getting, we we're getting smart.

124
00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:09.805
So we decide, hey, you do chapter two,

125
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:12.165
I'll do chapter three, bro, you got chapter four,

126
00:06:12.185 --> 00:06:13.605
and then we'll just kind share answers.

127
00:06:14.405 --> 00:06:18.405
Brilliant plan except for physics, you gotta, yeah,

128
00:06:18.405 --> 00:06:19.405
it builds off of each other.

129
00:06:19.705 --> 00:06:21.685
You can't really do chapter four if you don't know

130
00:06:21.685 --> 00:06:22.845
what's going on in chapter two.

131
00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:25.365
So after night two, we've got two chapters down

132
00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:27.125
and our pace is not going well.

133
00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:30.885
So desperate high school boys, we decided

134
00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:34.885
to borrow the teacher's textbook and he didn't know it.

135
00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:37.925
And it, uh, was awesome for a little bit.

136
00:06:37.945 --> 00:06:39.645
We were knocking out chapters left

137
00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:42.285
and right that first night until we got caught.

138
00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:46.245
So I'd love to tell you that we turned in the textbook

139
00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:48.165
and it was good and wasn't,

140
00:06:48.165 --> 00:06:51.725
but we had access to a copying machine.

141
00:06:52.105 --> 00:06:54.485
And so again, it gets bad to worse

142
00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:57.765
and our cheating scandal gets worse

143
00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:00.285
and worse that our teacher finally said, okay,

144
00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:02.125
you've gotta take a test.

145
00:07:02.865 --> 00:07:05.125
You gotta take a test. And what you make on the test is

146
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:06.405
what you get in the, in the class.

147
00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:10.325
And let's just say my result was not very good.

148
00:07:11.105 --> 00:07:14.005
And um, the decision to be lazy,

149
00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:16.245
to choose fun over responsibility

150
00:07:16.545 --> 00:07:19.445
and then to cheat about it had lasting effects on my

151
00:07:19.445 --> 00:07:23.165
transcript and my college scholarships that I did have.

152
00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:28.325
And so this is a small picture of a big truth.

153
00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:30.725
Sin has consequences

154
00:07:31.465 --> 00:07:34.445
and we'll see that play out in various ways in our text

155
00:07:34.545 --> 00:07:35.725
in Second Samuel today.

156
00:07:35.945 --> 00:07:40.025
So let me pray for us, Lord,

157
00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:43.945
as we open up your word in, um, trying to understand

158
00:07:43.945 --> 00:07:46.905
and grapple, um, what's going on,

159
00:07:47.325 --> 00:07:51.305
but also, uh, understand um,

160
00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:54.905
how you've called us to live as sons

161
00:07:54.905 --> 00:07:57.705
and daughters, uh, to reflect your goodness

162
00:07:57.705 --> 00:08:00.065
that we sang about to a lost world.

163
00:08:00.165 --> 00:08:02.585
Let us be convicted of the sin.

164
00:08:03.325 --> 00:08:07.785
Let us be a people who, who choose, uh, to chase

165
00:08:07.785 --> 00:08:10.385
after you in all times.

166
00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:13.385
And it's in your son's name that we pray. Amen.

167
00:08:15.685 --> 00:08:17.585
Two Samuel 21 verse one.

168
00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:20.505
It says, now, there was a famine in the days of David

169
00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:22.785
for three years, year after year.

170
00:08:23.095 --> 00:08:24.345
Okay, pause for a second.

171
00:08:24.495 --> 00:08:26.585
Anytime we see famines in scripture,

172
00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:29.105
it often represents God's judgment.

173
00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:30.225
And that's what's happening here

174
00:08:30.415 --> 00:08:33.105
because Saul's sin, which was breaking the covenant

175
00:08:33.175 --> 00:08:36.865
with the gibeonites, God had brought famine upon the land.

176
00:08:36.965 --> 00:08:39.985
So this was Saul's personal sin that had

177
00:08:40.545 --> 00:08:43.265
national consequences pick back up.

178
00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:46.665
And David sought the face of the Lord.

179
00:08:46.765 --> 00:08:49.505
And the Lord said there is blood guilt on Saul

180
00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:52.585
and on his house because he put the gibeonites to death.

181
00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:55.580
So the king called the Gibeonites and and spoke to them.

182
00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:58.005
Now, the gibbon knights were not of the people of Israel

183
00:08:58.025 --> 00:09:00.165
but were of the remnant of the Amorites.

184
00:09:01.205 --> 00:09:03.045
Although the people of Israel had sworn des spare them,

185
00:09:03.555 --> 00:09:06.565
Saul has had sought to strike them down in his zeal

186
00:09:06.785 --> 00:09:08.045
for the people of Israel.

187
00:09:08.065 --> 00:09:11.365
And Judah, our first point today is

188
00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:13.725
that our sin has consequences both

189
00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:15.965
individually and corporately.

190
00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:19.325
Think about it. There are countless biblical stories

191
00:09:19.735 --> 00:09:23.565
where a character is sinned and then faced consequences.

192
00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:25.925
Of course, we've been talking the last few weeks about

193
00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:28.165
David's sin and the consequences that he's had.

194
00:09:28.305 --> 00:09:33.085
But what about Moses? Moses, if you remember, in pride

195
00:09:33.145 --> 00:09:35.205
and frustration, he struck the rock.

196
00:09:35.265 --> 00:09:37.485
He disobeyed God. And what was his consequence?

197
00:09:38.585 --> 00:09:42.565
He was kept out of the promised land. What about Manasses?

198
00:09:42.945 --> 00:09:45.045
Do you guys know the story of Manasses?

199
00:09:45.515 --> 00:09:48.085
He's considered one of the most evil kings in all of Israel.

200
00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:51.045
He built, he rebuilt pagan altars

201
00:09:51.275 --> 00:09:54.565
that his father had destroyed and he worshiped false gods.

202
00:09:54.905 --> 00:09:57.005
He defiled the temple with these false gods.

203
00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:59.005
He practiced divination, sorcery,

204
00:09:59.195 --> 00:10:00.925
consulted mediums and spirits.

205
00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:06.525
And even more so, he buried his own, he burned his own sons

206
00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:09.765
as offerings to these pa and gods.

207
00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:14.005
And so because of those sins, what happened?

208
00:10:15.035 --> 00:10:18.165
Well, God declared judgment on the entire people of Judah

209
00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:20.965
and they were then sentenced to exile

210
00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:22.845
and under the captivity of Babylon.

211
00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:27.365
So one man's sin cost the nation their conseque.

212
00:10:27.525 --> 00:10:32.165
A consequence, probably the most recognizable sin in all

213
00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:34.525
of scripture I think is in the garden.

214
00:10:35.115 --> 00:10:37.725
When Adam and Eve sinned, they disobeyed God

215
00:10:38.025 --> 00:10:41.925
and they brought the curse of sin to all humanity.

216
00:10:43.665 --> 00:10:46.365
So what's going on here in two Samuel is

217
00:10:46.485 --> 00:10:47.805
that Israel made a treaty,

218
00:10:47.805 --> 00:10:49.445
made a promise to the Gibby knights.

219
00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:51.885
We see that back in Joshua chapter nine.

220
00:10:52.275 --> 00:10:54.805
Then when Saul, when he was in power, he attempted

221
00:10:54.805 --> 00:10:56.605
to annihilate them from the face of the earth.

222
00:10:57.345 --> 00:10:58.445
So because of that sin,

223
00:10:58.445 --> 00:10:59.765
because of the breach of the covenant,

224
00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:02.085
God was causing famine in the land.

225
00:11:03.385 --> 00:11:08.365
Sin Saul sin had lingering effects on the entire nation.

226
00:11:09.805 --> 00:11:12.245
I think that leads us to ask ourselves a couple questions.

227
00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:15.605
One, what are the consequences of my sin? Right?

228
00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:18.765
You sin so you, I think it's only natural to say,

229
00:11:18.765 --> 00:11:19.885
what are my consequences?

230
00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:23.405
And two, how has my sin affected others?

231
00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:28.605
There is a difference between eternal consequences

232
00:11:28.905 --> 00:11:30.125
and earthly consequences.

233
00:11:30.785 --> 00:11:34.245
The ultimate, the eternal consequences of our sin is what?

234
00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:36.525
It's death according to Romans 6 23.

235
00:11:36.825 --> 00:11:38.125
For the wages of sin is death.

236
00:11:39.545 --> 00:11:41.885
Isaiah 59 2 says this, it says,

237
00:11:42.105 --> 00:11:44.285
but your iniquities have made a separation

238
00:11:44.285 --> 00:11:45.965
between you and your God.

239
00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:49.005
And your sins have hidden his face from you so

240
00:11:49.005 --> 00:11:50.245
that he does not hear.

241
00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:52.205
The eternal consequence

242
00:11:52.465 --> 00:11:55.445
of our sin is separation from God and death.

243
00:11:55.595 --> 00:11:59.045
That is the consequence of man's rebellion.

244
00:12:00.635 --> 00:12:02.885
Just like sin entered the world through Adam

245
00:12:02.885 --> 00:12:05.965
and Eve, though we also have a promise in Romans five 19

246
00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:08.845
where for as by one man's disobedience,

247
00:12:08.845 --> 00:12:10.045
the many were made sinners.

248
00:12:10.545 --> 00:12:13.565
So by one man's obedience, which we know is Jesus Christ,

249
00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:18.485
the many will be made righteous Scripture shares

250
00:12:18.485 --> 00:12:21.565
with us about our earthly consequences of sin as well.

251
00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:24.885
Listen to what Paul says in Ephesians four 18

252
00:12:24.885 --> 00:12:27.965
and 19 about those who liken themselves to their old self

253
00:12:29.145 --> 00:12:30.765
and they choose to indulge sin.

254
00:12:30.765 --> 00:12:33.125
It says they're darkened in their understanding,

255
00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:35.005
alienated from the life of God

256
00:12:35.035 --> 00:12:37.885
because of the ignorance that is in them due

257
00:12:37.885 --> 00:12:39.085
to the hardness of heart.

258
00:12:39.515 --> 00:12:40.605
They've become callous

259
00:12:40.605 --> 00:12:42.365
and they've given themselves up to sensuality,

260
00:12:42.705 --> 00:12:45.965
to greedy things to practice every spiritual kind

261
00:12:46.145 --> 00:12:47.885
or every kind of impurity.

262
00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:49.925
They were greedy.

263
00:12:50.465 --> 00:12:55.245
One of the more earthly consequences of sin is more sin.

264
00:12:56.665 --> 00:12:59.005
And there's this insatiable lust for more.

265
00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.285
And it's, it's, I want more. And you're doled.

266
00:13:02.305 --> 00:13:04.285
Our consciousnesses are are dulled

267
00:13:04.425 --> 00:13:06.405
and we're blind to spiritual truth.

268
00:13:07.385 --> 00:13:09.845
At least I know that to be true in my own life that

269
00:13:10.115 --> 00:13:12.645
that sin just gr grapples me.

270
00:13:12.705 --> 00:13:14.325
And it just, it's like a snowball.

271
00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:19.755
I often want what's more. I want more. I want a little more.

272
00:13:19.795 --> 00:13:21.235
I want the bigger house. I want the newer phone.

273
00:13:21.375 --> 00:13:23.395
And we know that contentment is a gift.

274
00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:28.235
We scratch and sniff at sin and then we want a little more.

275
00:13:28.505 --> 00:13:30.955
Then we get curious and we want a little more

276
00:13:30.975 --> 00:13:32.235
and a little more, a little more.

277
00:13:32.255 --> 00:13:34.795
And before we know it, we have an addiction.

278
00:13:35.785 --> 00:13:38.955
This lust and greed for more according

279
00:13:39.015 --> 00:13:42.035
to one Corinthians two causes us to be folly

280
00:13:42.035 --> 00:13:43.075
to spiritual things.

281
00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:47.315
One of the earthly consequences of sin is more sin.

282
00:13:48.905 --> 00:13:52.675
When Jesus began his ministry in Mark, it says,

283
00:13:53.055 --> 00:13:56.075
the time has come, the kingdom of God is near repent

284
00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:57.155
and believe the good news.

285
00:13:57.465 --> 00:13:58.595
What is that good news?

286
00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:02.795
The good news is for God's so of the world

287
00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:04.635
that he gave his one

288
00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:07.955
and only son that so whosoever believes in him,

289
00:14:08.335 --> 00:14:11.355
should not have or should ha, should not perish

290
00:14:11.575 --> 00:14:12.835
but have eternal life.

291
00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.115
Amen. The ultimate

292
00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:17.755
and the most severe consequence of varsity in his death

293
00:14:17.755 --> 00:14:18.875
and separation from God.

294
00:14:20.495 --> 00:14:24.555
But God. But God, when we repent of our sin

295
00:14:24.775 --> 00:14:28.475
and we believe that God gave us his son to pay the price

296
00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:31.075
for our consequences, we are forgiven.

297
00:14:31.365 --> 00:14:32.875
We've been made right with God.

298
00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:36.035
We're no longer an outcast, but we're part of the family.

299
00:14:36.545 --> 00:14:40.515
There's no longer an eternal punishment for our sin

300
00:14:40.515 --> 00:14:42.955
because Christ has already paid it.

301
00:14:43.895 --> 00:14:45.755
Yes, sin will still sting,

302
00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:48.995
but Christ has removed that eternal penalty.

303
00:14:51.545 --> 00:14:54.125
But the text warrants us to ask that second question,

304
00:14:55.065 --> 00:14:56.885
how does my sin affect others?

305
00:14:58.305 --> 00:14:59.885
So in one Corinthians five,

306
00:14:59.985 --> 00:15:02.525
Paul's writing about sexual sin, sexual immorality.

307
00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:05.285
And he says this, don't you know

308
00:15:05.285 --> 00:15:07.805
that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough?

309
00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:13.645
I love red. Gimme those carbs, right? Can I get in? Amen.

310
00:15:13.645 --> 00:15:14.685
Amen. Thank you, thank you.

311
00:15:14.905 --> 00:15:17.045
Our scones are top notch here,

312
00:15:17.065 --> 00:15:19.285
but biscuits, pancakes, muffins, I'll take them all.

313
00:15:20.525 --> 00:15:23.085
I don't, I'm not a baker, I don't know much about yeast.

314
00:15:23.185 --> 00:15:25.045
But what Paul is saying here is

315
00:15:26.805 --> 00:15:30.485
a little yeast soon permeates the whole batch of dough.

316
00:15:30.755 --> 00:15:35.285
Meaning even small hidden sins, even sins

317
00:15:35.285 --> 00:15:39.045
that you may not think are a big deal affect

318
00:15:40.185 --> 00:15:42.205
you and affect this body.

319
00:15:43.385 --> 00:15:46.725
It will always have a ripple outward.

320
00:15:47.475 --> 00:15:49.885
Just like Saul, sins affected Israel.

321
00:15:50.505 --> 00:15:52.485
Our sin affects the body of Christ.

322
00:15:55.165 --> 00:15:59.045
I love scripture. Almost anywhere where you see a command,

323
00:15:59.545 --> 00:16:01.045
it is followed up with a promise

324
00:16:01.705 --> 00:16:05.325
and that's what's happens in Proverbs 28 13.

325
00:16:06.475 --> 00:16:08.405
This verse is full of hope.

326
00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:11.805
It says whoever conceals his transgressions will not

327
00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:14.245
prosper, but he who confesses

328
00:16:14.305 --> 00:16:16.525
and forsakes them will obtain mercy.

329
00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:19.965
I'd like to take a little rabbit trail here

330
00:16:19.965 --> 00:16:22.885
and talk about confessing sin when we sin.

331
00:16:23.185 --> 00:16:25.805
If you're a believer in Christ, you should feel conviction.

332
00:16:27.025 --> 00:16:28.445
You know that the things that you did

333
00:16:28.505 --> 00:16:29.765
grieve the heart of God.

334
00:16:30.305 --> 00:16:33.525
And when convicted according to this passage,

335
00:16:33.745 --> 00:16:37.045
we should confess those sins confess to one another.

336
00:16:38.025 --> 00:16:40.125
We should bring it to light. We should repent of it.

337
00:16:40.985 --> 00:16:45.365
And when that happens, we're relieved from this bondage of

338
00:16:45.385 --> 00:16:46.805
of shame and guilt.

339
00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:50.205
Conviction comes from the Holy Spirit.

340
00:16:50.735 --> 00:16:53.525
Shame and guilt though comes from the enemy.

341
00:16:54.835 --> 00:16:57.165
However, as believers, if we choose to hide this

342
00:16:57.345 --> 00:16:59.725
or conceal it, it says we will not

343
00:16:59.915 --> 00:17:03.105
prosper at times.

344
00:17:03.965 --> 00:17:06.625
If you're like me, I may regret my sin

345
00:17:07.845 --> 00:17:11.025
but not confess it or repent of it, I may get caught

346
00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.505
but not confess and repent.

347
00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:16.345
And then when that happens,

348
00:17:16.805 --> 00:17:19.945
we start believing the enemies lies that he's spouting at us

349
00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.905
and we find ourselves similar to Adam

350
00:17:21.965 --> 00:17:24.265
and Eve, isolated and ashamed.

351
00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.305
Proverbs 20 18, 28 13,

352
00:17:28.615 --> 00:17:31.465
whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,

353
00:17:31.845 --> 00:17:36.185
but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.

354
00:17:36.525 --> 00:17:39.985
That's the invitation today, confession and mercy 'cause

355
00:17:39.985 --> 00:17:43.985
because when we conceal sin, it does several things to us.

356
00:17:43.985 --> 00:17:46.625
It de desensitizes our consciousness.

357
00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.125
It distorts relationships among each other.

358
00:17:50.385 --> 00:17:52.885
You know we have Romans, it's all about one and others, but,

359
00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:57.245
but it distorts that sin distorts those relationships.

360
00:17:57.745 --> 00:18:00.525
It limits our effectiveness in gospel ministry.

361
00:18:01.025 --> 00:18:02.765
It opens the door for the enemy

362
00:18:02.825 --> 00:18:04.365
and it grieves the heart of God.

363
00:18:06.995 --> 00:18:10.575
If you're here last week, John read Romans eight one.

364
00:18:11.645 --> 00:18:12.775
This verse is full of

365
00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:16.215
so much hope there is there now no condemnation

366
00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:17.775
for those in Christ Jesus.

367
00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:20.055
For the law of the spirit

368
00:18:20.155 --> 00:18:22.335
of life has set you free in Christ Jesus.

369
00:18:22.565 --> 00:18:23.975
From the law of sin

370
00:18:23.975 --> 00:18:26.495
and death that my friends is the good news.

371
00:18:26.845 --> 00:18:28.335
When conviction happens,

372
00:18:30.085 --> 00:18:31.855
this good news does not mean though

373
00:18:31.855 --> 00:18:35.335
that God will overlook our sins or our little faults

374
00:18:35.335 --> 00:18:37.615
or our lapses or our little lies

375
00:18:37.755 --> 00:18:41.135
or are cheating on physics tests or cheating on our taxes

376
00:18:41.355 --> 00:18:43.535
or getting soda when you ordered water

377
00:18:43.635 --> 00:18:45.735
or secretly looking at pornography here

378
00:18:45.755 --> 00:18:49.295
or pornography there like those sins we think

379
00:18:49.475 --> 00:18:50.535
aren't a big deal.

380
00:18:52.195 --> 00:18:56.135
But in Romans it tells us that all sin breaks the heart

381
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:57.455
of God, breaks our fellowship.

382
00:18:58.845 --> 00:19:01.335
Paul tells us also in Romans that just

383
00:19:01.335 --> 00:19:05.335
because we have a forgiving God by no means, it says

384
00:19:05.355 --> 00:19:08.775
by no means many times by no means should we take advantage

385
00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:10.735
of his grace and of his mercy.

386
00:19:12.475 --> 00:19:15.015
The problem is sin is sin big or small.

387
00:19:15.515 --> 00:19:18.535
And though God loves us, his holiness is such

388
00:19:18.765 --> 00:19:23.335
that he will not, he will not tolerate any kind

389
00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:25.375
of sin in any kind of evil.

390
00:19:25.785 --> 00:19:28.655
There must be atonement for our sin.

391
00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:34.055
And that leads us to point number two.

392
00:19:35.515 --> 00:19:38.415
God requires justice and atonement for sin.

393
00:19:39.465 --> 00:19:43.055
Let's pick back up the text verses three through six.

394
00:19:45.035 --> 00:19:48.335
It says this. And David said to the gibeonites,

395
00:19:48.845 --> 00:19:49.855
what shall I do for you

396
00:19:50.035 --> 00:19:51.535
and how shall I make atonement

397
00:19:51.925 --> 00:19:54.055
that you may bless the heritage of the Lord?

398
00:19:54.715 --> 00:19:57.295
The gibeonites said to him, it is not a matter of silver

399
00:19:57.295 --> 00:19:59.375
or gold between us or so in his house.

400
00:19:59.685 --> 00:20:02.975
Neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.

401
00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:05.095
And he said, well what should I do for you?

402
00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:08.015
And he said to the king, the man who consumed us

403
00:20:08.075 --> 00:20:10.015
and plan to destroy us so

404
00:20:10.015 --> 00:20:11.695
that we should not have no place in all the

405
00:20:11.855 --> 00:20:12.935
territory of Israel.

406
00:20:13.385 --> 00:20:15.655
Let's seven of his sons be given to us so

407
00:20:15.655 --> 00:20:17.495
that we may hang them before the Lord.

408
00:20:17.575 --> 00:20:19.535
A gibb you of Saul, the chosen Lord.

409
00:20:19.795 --> 00:20:21.295
And the king said, I will give them.

410
00:20:21.555 --> 00:20:23.335
So they didn't want one man, they wanted seven.

411
00:20:23.965 --> 00:20:27.215
This is a sobering reminder that sin man's justice

412
00:20:27.725 --> 00:20:29.695
because of the breach of the treaty.

413
00:20:29.865 --> 00:20:32.655
David offers to make atonement, to make right the sins

414
00:20:32.655 --> 00:20:34.095
of Israel and what does it cost?

415
00:20:34.155 --> 00:20:36.095
Israel more deaths.

416
00:20:36.955 --> 00:20:40.135
Now I think it's important to to remember that just

417
00:20:40.135 --> 00:20:43.135
because the Bible describes certain actions does not mean

418
00:20:43.135 --> 00:20:45.495
that God prescribes them like it's happening here.

419
00:20:46.595 --> 00:20:49.005
It may seem harsh that the nation should suffer

420
00:20:49.465 --> 00:20:52.245
for the mistake of one man that is now dead.

421
00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:57.405
But time does not dule God's memory or his sense of justice.

422
00:20:58.235 --> 00:21:02.685
He's not just gonna forget about it. What about our nation?

423
00:21:03.225 --> 00:21:07.565
Do you think the sins of our nation's leaders both past

424
00:21:07.985 --> 00:21:10.325
and present will have an effect on us?

425
00:21:11.785 --> 00:21:14.365
Yes. Let's bring it home a little bit.

426
00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:18.205
Do you think the sins of our church leadership

427
00:21:18.205 --> 00:21:19.565
of the elders both past

428
00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:22.005
and present will have an effect on us?

429
00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:27.045
Yes. But so does your sin and so do my sin.

430
00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:32.035
No matter how long you think you've gotten away with it,

431
00:21:32.565 --> 00:21:34.035
God's memory does not fade.

432
00:21:35.205 --> 00:21:38.315
David responded to their requests by giving them,

433
00:21:38.925 --> 00:21:42.035
which is another reminder that sin still sings

434
00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:46.435
The sins of Saul cost his family their lives.

435
00:21:46.815 --> 00:21:48.115
It is a well-known quote

436
00:21:49.345 --> 00:21:51.795
that sin will take you further than you want to go,

437
00:21:52.305 --> 00:21:53.875
keep you longer than you want to stay

438
00:21:54.255 --> 00:21:56.155
and cost you more than you want to pay.

439
00:21:56.625 --> 00:21:57.795
That is the nature of sin.

440
00:21:58.095 --> 00:22:00.675
One can never calculate its fallout.

441
00:22:02.095 --> 00:22:05.705
Sometimes like here, our sin has consequences

442
00:22:05.775 --> 00:22:08.865
that abide long after the sin is committed.

443
00:22:09.565 --> 00:22:13.065
The good news, 'cause there's promises that always follow.

444
00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:15.705
The good news is that in the midst of the fallout,

445
00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.385
sin does not have a final word in our lives.

446
00:22:19.165 --> 00:22:22.385
If you are a believer of Christ, the consequences

447
00:22:22.525 --> 00:22:25.905
of your sin do not determine your eternal destiny.

448
00:22:26.565 --> 00:22:27.825
But they may affect your days.

449
00:22:27.845 --> 00:22:30.915
Now friend, if you've been here before

450
00:22:31.095 --> 00:22:33.755
or you've been a part of a Bible believing church

451
00:22:33.755 --> 00:22:35.915
before you've heard this, this isn't new.

452
00:22:36.135 --> 00:22:40.075
But God requires justice and atonement for sin.

453
00:22:42.215 --> 00:22:44.595
But he provides that for us.

454
00:22:44.975 --> 00:22:46.395
He provides the gospel truth

455
00:22:46.425 --> 00:22:48.875
because Jesus took that justice upon himself.

456
00:22:49.665 --> 00:22:51.555
Like in verse or point number one,

457
00:22:51.555 --> 00:22:53.155
we talked about the gospel and

458
00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:55.595
and point number two, we're talking about the gospel.

459
00:22:55.595 --> 00:22:56.995
Point number three, we're gonna talk about the gospel.

460
00:22:57.685 --> 00:22:59.835
God's holiness demands payment for sin

461
00:23:00.055 --> 00:23:03.275
and Christ paid it all on the cross for us.

462
00:23:03.695 --> 00:23:06.235
So those sins that you have that you've hidden

463
00:23:06.615 --> 00:23:09.515
or that you've exposed, Christ has paid for them.

464
00:23:10.855 --> 00:23:13.955
The Bible tells us to call to action is to confess those.

465
00:23:16.615 --> 00:23:20.955
If we look back at our text verses seven through 14 describe

466
00:23:21.295 --> 00:23:23.435
how David atone for the sins of Israel.

467
00:23:23.655 --> 00:23:27.235
And verse 14 ends with this phrase, God responded

468
00:23:27.235 --> 00:23:29.195
to the please of the Lord of the land.

469
00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:32.435
What does this mean? Chapter 24, verse 25 says,

470
00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:34.835
the Lord responded to the please of the land

471
00:23:35.055 --> 00:23:37.235
and the plague was averted from Israel.

472
00:23:40.245 --> 00:23:44.835
Point number three, finally we see that David, ain't it?

473
00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:48.245
So I got my my physics teachers.

474
00:23:48.265 --> 00:23:51.045
Now my English teachers, David ain't it,

475
00:23:51.615 --> 00:23:54.885
David was not the promised king that they,

476
00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:57.405
that the Israelites had put their hope in.

477
00:23:59.715 --> 00:24:01.445
Read with me. Verses 15 through 20

478
00:24:04.225 --> 00:24:07.165
it says there was war again between the Philistines

479
00:24:07.305 --> 00:24:10.565
and Israel and David went down together with the servants

480
00:24:11.185 --> 00:24:14.125
and they fought against the Philistines and David grew weary

481
00:24:14.785 --> 00:24:17.485
and ish Bab, one of the descendants of the giants

482
00:24:17.485 --> 00:24:19.445
who spear weighed 300 shekels of bronze

483
00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:23.285
and whose armed with a new sword thought to kill David.

484
00:24:23.865 --> 00:24:26.565
But Abishai the senator, Zeriah came to his aid

485
00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:27.765
and attacked the Philistines

486
00:24:27.765 --> 00:24:30.645
and killed him then David's being swore to him,

487
00:24:30.905 --> 00:24:32.565
you shall no longer go out with us

488
00:24:32.565 --> 00:24:36.775
to battle lest you quench the lamp of Israel 18.

489
00:24:37.515 --> 00:24:39.615
And there was war again with the Philistines at God.

490
00:24:40.325 --> 00:24:45.135
Then the Tite struck down the Saf, who is one

491
00:24:45.135 --> 00:24:47.895
of the descendants of the giants 19.

492
00:24:48.315 --> 00:24:50.615
And there was war again with the Philistines at Gob.

493
00:24:50.795 --> 00:24:52.695
And Neil Hannon, the son of Jerry

494
00:24:52.955 --> 00:24:56.135
or the Bethlehemite, struck down Goliath, the Tite,

495
00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:59.335
the shaft of who spear was like a weaver's beam.

496
00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:04.095
20. And there was war again at Gath where there was a man

497
00:25:04.095 --> 00:25:06.655
of great stature who had six fingers on each hand,

498
00:25:07.075 --> 00:25:09.775
six toes on each foot, 24 in number,

499
00:25:10.195 --> 00:25:13.095
and was also a descendant from the giants.

500
00:25:14.475 --> 00:25:16.215
Anyone else? When you read that, think of the movie,

501
00:25:16.235 --> 00:25:18.175
the Princess Bride and the six fingered man.

502
00:25:19.225 --> 00:25:24.175
Thank you. Um, but there was war again. There was war again.

503
00:25:24.825 --> 00:25:27.415
There was war again. There was war again.

504
00:25:27.765 --> 00:25:29.095
Four times it's mentioned.

505
00:25:29.095 --> 00:25:32.935
And why, to remind us that David was not the savior.

506
00:25:33.075 --> 00:25:36.015
Israel needed. The giants returned,

507
00:25:36.915 --> 00:25:39.775
the wars continued, the kingdom was fractured.

508
00:25:39.985 --> 00:25:41.175
David grew weary

509
00:25:41.395 --> 00:25:45.015
and Israel still longed for the perfect king.

510
00:25:47.475 --> 00:25:49.695
We know that that king did come

511
00:25:50.155 --> 00:25:54.775
and his name was the son of David, Jesus Christ, who brought

512
00:25:55.415 --> 00:25:57.175
a kingdom that would never end.

513
00:25:57.235 --> 00:25:58.775
And he's gonna come again soon.

514
00:26:00.305 --> 00:26:02.295
We're not too far away from advent

515
00:26:02.585 --> 00:26:05.655
where we celebrate the birth, his birth

516
00:26:05.715 --> 00:26:08.495
and we worship the King Mark one, 14

517
00:26:08.515 --> 00:26:10.775
and 15 tells us that, that Jesus brings

518
00:26:11.305 --> 00:26:12.935
God's kingdom and fullness of time.

519
00:26:12.935 --> 00:26:16.215
It says the time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God is near.

520
00:26:16.715 --> 00:26:21.495
Repent and believe the good news repent

521
00:26:21.555 --> 00:26:22.575
and believe the good news.

522
00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:25.695
So what do we do with a passage like this?

523
00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:30.375
I think there's two things. Confession and worship.

524
00:26:31.805 --> 00:26:36.015
Confess because the consequences of sin still sting for you,

525
00:26:36.515 --> 00:26:37.775
but also for us.

526
00:26:38.565 --> 00:26:40.015
Your sin is not private.

527
00:26:40.425 --> 00:26:43.015
Don't just feel bad about it, but repent of it.

528
00:26:43.155 --> 00:26:46.085
Turn from it. I was able to pray with one

529
00:26:46.085 --> 00:26:49.765
of our elders this week, and this was part of his prayer.

530
00:26:49.765 --> 00:26:53.845
He said, Lord, as elders, we are unworthy.

531
00:26:54.065 --> 00:26:55.525
We are unclean. Forgive us.

532
00:26:56.305 --> 00:26:58.725
May that be our church's heartbeat.

533
00:26:58.995 --> 00:27:01.165
Forgive us, father of our sin.

534
00:27:03.265 --> 00:27:05.805
The second thing we ought to do in a passage like this is we

535
00:27:05.825 --> 00:27:07.485
see atonement for our sin.

536
00:27:07.785 --> 00:27:10.645
And we should worship because we can't have the good

537
00:27:10.645 --> 00:27:11.765
news without the bad news.

538
00:27:11.765 --> 00:27:13.765
And we've talked about the consequences of

539
00:27:13.785 --> 00:27:16.205
how sin has separated us from God for all eternity.

540
00:27:17.265 --> 00:27:20.405
We should worship because why God

541
00:27:21.315 --> 00:27:24.205
sent his son Jesus to pay those consequences

542
00:27:24.345 --> 00:27:25.405
so that you don't have to.

543
00:27:26.585 --> 00:27:29.645
So we're gonna respond in hope

544
00:27:31.425 --> 00:27:34.525
and song and thank him for the cross.

545
00:27:35.465 --> 00:27:36.605
So the band's gonna come out

546
00:27:36.605 --> 00:27:38.565
and we're gonna sing the song Come Thou found.

547
00:27:39.145 --> 00:27:42.085
And uh, I love the line O to grace,

548
00:27:42.185 --> 00:27:45.045
how great a debtor daily I'm constrained to be.

549
00:27:45.705 --> 00:27:47.325
Let that grace now like a F

550
00:27:47.385 --> 00:27:49.325
by my wondering heart, heart to bee.

551
00:27:49.905 --> 00:27:53.245
And then it says this, it says, prone to wonder, Lord,

552
00:27:53.285 --> 00:27:55.125
I feel it prone to leave the God I love.

553
00:27:55.705 --> 00:27:57.685
Here's my heart. Take and seal it.

554
00:27:57.685 --> 00:27:58.965
Seal it for thy courts above.

555
00:27:59.505 --> 00:28:03.085
Let that verse be a confession for us as a church.

556
00:28:03.155 --> 00:28:05.605
That as a church, we're prone to wonder,

557
00:28:06.015 --> 00:28:07.205
we're prone to leave.

558
00:28:08.985 --> 00:28:12.285
But Father, take our heart, seal it for thy courts above.

559
00:28:13.545 --> 00:28:15.445
If you've never confessed your sins

560
00:28:16.185 --> 00:28:17.845
and believed in Jesus, we're gonna have

561
00:28:17.845 --> 00:28:19.005
some prayer partners on the side.

562
00:28:19.005 --> 00:28:22.125
They would love to pray with you and alongside of you

563
00:28:22.345 --> 00:28:23.765
and intercede on your behalf.

564
00:28:23.945 --> 00:28:28.085
Or if you want to, to pray for a health issue

565
00:28:28.145 --> 00:28:30.525
or a job opportunity, they would love to,

566
00:28:30.905 --> 00:28:32.365
um, come alongside.

567
00:28:32.985 --> 00:28:34.405
If you're struggling

568
00:28:34.625 --> 00:28:37.205
and entangled with sin, they're available that way.

569
00:28:37.935 --> 00:28:40.325
Let's stand together in sing the Song

570
00:28:40.325 --> 00:28:41.565
of Confession corporately.
