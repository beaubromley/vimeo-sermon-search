00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:17.895
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:17.965 --> 00:00:19.575
It's great to see you. If you're new here,

3
00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:21.415
my name is John, one of the pastors here.

4
00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:24.175
We would love to get to know you if you are new.

5
00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:26.375
Uh, there's a QR code on the seat in front of you.

6
00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:28.375
You can fill that out, just simple form online

7
00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:30.655
or you can take that card out to the lobby

8
00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:33.735
to our new here area just to get to know us so we can get

9
00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:35.335
to know you a little bit better.

10
00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:38.055
There's also a great way for you if you are newer

11
00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:40.535
to our church or maybe you've been here for 40 years,

12
00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:41.815
either way to get

13
00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:43.775
to know a little bit about what's going on in our church.

14
00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:46.455
We're having a church family meeting next Sunday

15
00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:47.775
afternoon from three to five.

16
00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:51.015
Invite all of you to be there, uh, old or new.

17
00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:53.255
We would love to have you because it's a great time for us

18
00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:56.335
to celebrate what God has done, to pray for what he's doing,

19
00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.495
and to look ahead really to some cool things

20
00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:00.935
that we believe God is doing

21
00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:02.815
and wants to do through our church.

22
00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:03.935
And so that's next Sunday.

23
00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:06.655
But finally, just briefly let me mention this.

24
00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:10.695
If you are at all worried over the next couple weeks in your

25
00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:12.975
own life, your family, about food insecurity

26
00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:16.815
or how bills are gonna be paid just based on what's going on

27
00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:18.735
in our culture right now, we would love

28
00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:19.935
to have you call the offices.

29
00:01:20.595 --> 00:01:21.935
We can point you to resources.

30
00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:23.615
We've got some, there's others in the

31
00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:24.695
community we can help you with.

32
00:01:24.765 --> 00:01:27.695
Okay? So if that's at all on your mind, if you're worried,

33
00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:32.295
please don't stop and don't hesitate to call the offices.

34
00:01:32.445 --> 00:01:36.815
We'd love to help you. So today we are nearing the end

35
00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:39.135
of our journey through first and second Samuel.

36
00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:40.455
Just a couple weeks left.

37
00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:43.455
We've seen a couple kings now rise and fall,

38
00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:46.855
and all of it has pointed us to looking forward from

39
00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:49.655
that point in history, looking forward to the true

40
00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:53.495
promised King that we now know Jesus to be

41
00:01:54.595 --> 00:01:55.615
as we get into it today.

42
00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:57.975
Uh, lemme tell you about one of the most irrational fears I

43
00:01:57.975 --> 00:01:59.015
had when I was a kid.

44
00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:02.135
Uh, I, I guess just how many people talked about it,

45
00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:03.335
the way people talked about it.

46
00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:06.375
I was certain that I would encounter quicksand way more

47
00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:10.255
often than I have in my life, like terrifying

48
00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:12.815
and just thought maybe I would still,

49
00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:14.415
maybe I thought I was gonna be Indiana Jones

50
00:02:14.475 --> 00:02:16.535
or something like that and just have the quicksand

51
00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:20.135
and snakes and all that stuff, but I, I know it's real.

52
00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.455
But the, the fearsome thing about quicksand is

53
00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:25.495
that it traps you

54
00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:30.295
and the more you move while you're in it is,

55
00:02:30.675 --> 00:02:32.215
is making it suck you more

56
00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:37.175
and more into its hold into the mire that the quicksand is.

57
00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:41.295
There's a way out. It's not gonna just drown you.

58
00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:44.895
There's a way out, but you need help to get out

59
00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:46.015
of the quicksand.

60
00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:51.655
Isn't it interesting that your past

61
00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:54.815
can function a lot like quicksand?

62
00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:01.605
See, we can get trapped in the cycle of regret

63
00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:03.645
over what we've done

64
00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:08.565
and that whirlpool can suck us into a really dark place.

65
00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:15.485
When that guilt monster creeps onto your shoulders based on

66
00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:17.885
what you've done as you think back, you know what happened,

67
00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:20.605
it can block the light of God's mercy

68
00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:25.835
And it can lead to further compromise.

69
00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:29.515
Like you almost can't even think about God loving you

70
00:03:29.515 --> 00:03:30.995
or God's mercy, a grace to you,

71
00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:34.635
and it can lead you to further steps down that dark road.

72
00:03:34.775 --> 00:03:38.195
See, my hope today here as we look at David, deal with

73
00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:43.155
that same situation, my hope today is that

74
00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.715
each of us can be awakened

75
00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:50.635
to the solution

76
00:03:51.745 --> 00:03:52.995
That God offers us.

77
00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:56.475
Because the reality is every one of us are gonna be in

78
00:03:56.475 --> 00:03:57.475
that state at some point.

79
00:03:58.645 --> 00:04:00.875
Maybe you are even right now.

80
00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:04.275
What solution does God offer us?

81
00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:05.515
And so I wanna just pray

82
00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:09.075
that God would teach us open our hearts and minds.

83
00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:11.275
Lord, thank you for your word.

84
00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:15.195
And we pray that as we look at Second Samuel again today,

85
00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:18.155
that you would teach us

86
00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:21.075
and remind us of what we need to remember

87
00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:23.435
as we follow you in a world

88
00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:28.755
and in our lives that is all about dredging up the past

89
00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:31.875
and, and maybe the enemy is right now on somebody tapping

90
00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:34.755
their shoulder saying, Hey, remember, remember God,

91
00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:37.835
show us today what you want to show us

92
00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:42.355
that we can walk in freedom for your glory,

93
00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:43.515
for our good, for others.

94
00:04:43.705 --> 00:04:46.195
Good. In Jesus' name, amen.

95
00:04:48.415 --> 00:04:52.435
So where we left off in chapter 18 last week is

96
00:04:52.435 --> 00:04:54.595
that David's son who was trying

97
00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:58.915
to steal the throne from David Absalom, he was now dead

98
00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:02.075
and David was grieving deeply over the loss.

99
00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:08.475
And so we see it here in chapter 19 verses one through four,

100
00:05:09.305 --> 00:05:11.235
this continuation of his grief,

101
00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:18.035
two Samuel 19 verse one, it was told Joab,

102
00:05:19.095 --> 00:05:21.595
behold the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.

103
00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:25.715
And so the victory that day was turned into mourning

104
00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:26.835
for all the people.

105
00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:28.875
For the people heard that day,

106
00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:30.355
the king is grieving for his son.

107
00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:33.695
And the people stole into the city that day

108
00:05:33.915 --> 00:05:37.695
as people steal in who are ashamed when they flee in battle,

109
00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:40.175
The king covered his face

110
00:05:40.195 --> 00:05:41.975
and the king cried with a loud voice.

111
00:05:42.035 --> 00:05:46.335
Oh my son, Absalom. Oh Absalom, my son, my son.

112
00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:51.215
So at that time, what

113
00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:54.175
to some would've felt like a victory march

114
00:05:54.245 --> 00:05:56.415
that this rebel is now gone.

115
00:05:56.515 --> 00:05:58.925
The rebellions quenched what them

116
00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.805
to them should have felt like a victory march

117
00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:03.245
that David's back on the throne that was quenched

118
00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:07.925
by the way, David was responding, A day of deliverance

119
00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:12.365
turned into a day of shame for David's army.

120
00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:17.285
Now, let's not minimize

121
00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:19.125
how terrible it would be to lose a son.

122
00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:21.725
I can't imagine what I would feel

123
00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:24.245
like David would feel here, but,

124
00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:27.805
but why was David mourning like this in

125
00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:30.325
what maybe even seemed like an over the top kind of way?

126
00:06:30.345 --> 00:06:33.485
Why was he so grieved that he couldn't even function

127
00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:39.045
because he knew the terrible truth that

128
00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:42.965
he was the ultimate cause of this whole thing?

129
00:06:45.245 --> 00:06:48.005
Remember his sins against Bathsheba

130
00:06:48.005 --> 00:06:50.485
and against Uriah all the way back in chapters 11

131
00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:54.405
and 12 that brought judgment on him

132
00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:57.245
and his family, the sword would not depart from his house.

133
00:06:57.305 --> 00:07:02.125
Here's evidence. And

134
00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.845
so David is feeling not only the grief of losing a son,

135
00:07:04.845 --> 00:07:06.205
he's feeling the the consequence

136
00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:08.725
of the responsibility he felt for it.

137
00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:13.525
Well, watch how Joab, the commander

138
00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:15.085
of David's army responded.

139
00:07:15.955 --> 00:07:17.325
Look at verses five through seven,

140
00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:22.285
then Joab came into the house to the king

141
00:07:22.305 --> 00:07:24.165
and said, you have today covered with shame.

142
00:07:24.185 --> 00:07:25.565
The faces of all your servants

143
00:07:25.705 --> 00:07:28.405
who have this day saved your life and the lives of your sons

144
00:07:28.405 --> 00:07:31.125
and your daughters, the lives of your wives, your con mines,

145
00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:32.805
because you love those who hate you

146
00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:34.445
and hate those who love you.

147
00:07:35.385 --> 00:07:37.405
For you've made it clear today that commanders

148
00:07:37.405 --> 00:07:39.525
and servants are nothing to you for today.

149
00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:40.965
I know that if ab some were alive

150
00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:43.525
and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased.

151
00:07:45.345 --> 00:07:48.325
Now therefore arise, go out, speak kindly to your servants

152
00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:49.405
for I swear by the Lord.

153
00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:52.805
If you do not go, not a man will stay with you this night.

154
00:07:53.955 --> 00:07:55.765
This will be worse for you than all the evil

155
00:07:55.765 --> 00:07:58.005
that has come upon you from your youth until now.

156
00:08:00.195 --> 00:08:04.525
Hard words, right? Like offensive words in

157
00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:05.645
some way to David.

158
00:08:05.745 --> 00:08:07.965
But true words.

159
00:08:10.105 --> 00:08:13.205
See, David's guilt had become so consuming

160
00:08:13.315 --> 00:08:15.845
that he could not see God's hand

161
00:08:15.905 --> 00:08:17.605
of preservation for his family.

162
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:24.205
And it appeared to everyone that he loved his rebel son

163
00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:25.725
who tried to kill him,

164
00:08:27.225 --> 00:08:29.925
yet at the same time hated the faithful servants

165
00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:31.165
who protected his life

166
00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:33.765
and risked their own lives to protect David.

167
00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:36.725
I mean, that's what it looked like to everybody else.

168
00:08:39.945 --> 00:08:44.565
But this is what unresolved guilt does.

169
00:08:46.685 --> 00:08:51.225
It corrupts your affections and it blinds you to grace.

170
00:08:54.565 --> 00:08:56.645
And so David had a choice to make at this point.

171
00:08:58.465 --> 00:08:59.925
Was he gonna continue in this grief

172
00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:01.405
and continue to lose his army

173
00:09:01.465 --> 00:09:03.365
and they were gonna run off and he was gonna be alone?

174
00:09:03.385 --> 00:09:05.965
Is he gonna continue in that or is he gonna get up and lead?

175
00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:13.165
Well look at verse eight. Then the king

176
00:09:13.165 --> 00:09:15.845
of arose and took his seat in the gate, a place

177
00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:17.005
where he led from.

178
00:09:17.985 --> 00:09:19.365
And the people were all told,

179
00:09:19.465 --> 00:09:21.845
behold the king is sitting in the gate

180
00:09:22.865 --> 00:09:25.045
and all the people came before the king.

181
00:09:26.945 --> 00:09:28.845
He awakened to his responsibility.

182
00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:31.965
He didn't feel better.

183
00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:36.325
He didn't have closure, but he obeyed.

184
00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:39.285
He obeyed God. He knew this was his

185
00:09:39.285 --> 00:09:40.645
responsibility as the king.

186
00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:45.045
And so he chose to honor God's deliverance even while his

187
00:09:45.045 --> 00:09:48.085
heart was shattered at the loss.

188
00:09:52.355 --> 00:09:56.005
David's paralyzing grief over Absalom

189
00:09:56.705 --> 00:09:59.485
nearly turned God's gracious victory

190
00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:02.005
into catastrophic defeat

191
00:10:05.055 --> 00:10:10.045
until this fierce rebuke awakened David to reality.

192
00:10:13.465 --> 00:10:17.965
Here's the point, church, don't let your

193
00:10:18.195 --> 00:10:21.245
past consume God's mercy today.

194
00:10:24.395 --> 00:10:29.165
Like don't let your past are.

195
00:10:29.185 --> 00:10:33.405
Are you so consumed by guilt over past

196
00:10:34.035 --> 00:10:37.485
sins that you can never receive God's mercies today?

197
00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:43.315
Are you in that quicksand of regret

198
00:10:43.525 --> 00:10:47.555
where you're just thinking right now God doesn't love me?

199
00:10:49.025 --> 00:10:51.355
Like is that in your mind? God doesn't love me?

200
00:10:51.355 --> 00:10:55.065
Listen, that's not humility you.

201
00:10:55.085 --> 00:10:56.985
You could get it wrong in your head to think, well,

202
00:10:57.005 --> 00:10:59.305
I'm being humble that somehow God doesn't love me.

203
00:10:59.305 --> 00:11:01.905
That's not humility. That's actually a form of pride

204
00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:05.385
that says you've done more than everybody else ever has

205
00:11:05.475 --> 00:11:09.065
house and you can't receive God's mercy

206
00:11:09.065 --> 00:11:10.585
because of the past.

207
00:11:10.885 --> 00:11:12.225
You're guilty over her.

208
00:11:15.715 --> 00:11:19.215
And so what I'm saying to you today, confess your sin,

209
00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.695
accept God's cleansing

210
00:11:24.595 --> 00:11:26.055
and then get up and serve him.

211
00:11:28.275 --> 00:11:31.865
Don't let it paralyze you your guilty conscience.

212
00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:35.145
Don't let it paralyze you from the calling God has

213
00:11:35.145 --> 00:11:36.185
given you today.

214
00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:40.105
It might be a different calling than it was before

215
00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:43.825
because of your sin, but still get up and obey.

216
00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:44.345
God,

217
00:11:49.405 --> 00:11:51.305
as I talk about this, I think about one

218
00:11:51.305 --> 00:11:53.105
of Jesus's closest disciples.

219
00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:57.685
His name was Peter. If you remember Peter boldly said

220
00:11:58.065 --> 00:11:59.925
on the night before, Jesus was crucified

221
00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:01.245
that he would never deny Jesus.

222
00:12:03.065 --> 00:12:07.565
Yet just a couple hours later, he denied he even knew Jesus.

223
00:12:11.635 --> 00:12:13.685
Well, there's a little detail to the scene

224
00:12:13.685 --> 00:12:15.365
that we often just skim over.

225
00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:19.605
It's recruited, recorded in in Luke 22.

226
00:12:20.525 --> 00:12:21.525
I want you to listen to this.

227
00:12:21.715 --> 00:12:25.045
This is when Peter, he denied Jesus the third time

228
00:12:25.105 --> 00:12:26.485
around this charcoal fire.

229
00:12:26.515 --> 00:12:28.125
He's he's saying, I don't even know the guy.

230
00:12:28.165 --> 00:12:30.485
I don't even know the guy on the third time,

231
00:12:30.665 --> 00:12:31.725
he denies Jesus.

232
00:12:31.775 --> 00:12:35.645
Watch what happens. And the Lord turned

233
00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:37.285
and looked at Peter

234
00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:42.125
and Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said

235
00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:43.765
to him before the rooster crows today,

236
00:12:43.765 --> 00:12:44.845
you'll deny me three times.

237
00:12:46.145 --> 00:12:47.165
And he went out

238
00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:50.965
and wept bitterly like,

239
00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:53.405
can you imagine the grief Peter would've felt in

240
00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:56.645
that moment, the regret he would've lived with

241
00:12:56.705 --> 00:13:00.245
as he watched his best friend go get crucified

242
00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:02.125
and buried knowing

243
00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:04.125
that he should have stood up for him and he didn't.

244
00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:06.045
He said, I don't even know the guy.

245
00:13:10.345 --> 00:13:13.725
That's part of what makes the end of John's gospel so

246
00:13:14.765 --> 00:13:17.085
powerful because

247
00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:20.565
after Jesus was resurrected, he came

248
00:13:20.565 --> 00:13:22.725
and found his disciples on the shore of the lake

249
00:13:22.725 --> 00:13:25.645
and he made them breakfast and he's cooking this breakfast

250
00:13:25.865 --> 00:13:29.685
and, and as Peter drew near to Jesus, I am sure

251
00:13:29.955 --> 00:13:32.605
that the smell of the charcoal fire

252
00:13:33.235 --> 00:13:37.965
flooded some memories back into Peter's mind Of

253
00:13:37.965 --> 00:13:41.165
what would've happened just a couple days earlier

254
00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:44.445
around a charcoal fire as well

255
00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:48.645
where he denied he even knew Jesus three times.

256
00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:56.365
Yet here's what Jesus did on that beach. Here's what he did.

257
00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:58.725
He sought Peter out

258
00:14:00.745 --> 00:14:04.525
and he gave Peter the opportunity to reaffirm his love

259
00:14:04.665 --> 00:14:08.525
for Jesus by Jesus affirming his love for Peter.

260
00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:13.795
And how many times did Jesus repeat that question in

261
00:14:13.795 --> 00:14:16.595
that conversation three times.

262
00:14:18.655 --> 00:14:21.795
How many times did Peter deny Jesus three times?

263
00:14:24.935 --> 00:14:28.835
See the grief that Peter would've felt could have

264
00:14:29.225 --> 00:14:32.795
overwhelmed him, it could have kept him from

265
00:14:32.885 --> 00:14:34.515
continuing to follow Jesus.

266
00:14:34.735 --> 00:14:37.075
It could have hindered his acceptance of God's mercy.

267
00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:38.435
And he could have walked off

268
00:14:38.535 --> 00:14:40.875
and said, I don't want anything to do with you Jesus anymore

269
00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:44.155
because I know I'm so dirty you could never love me again.

270
00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:47.235
But instead, Jesus met him where he was

271
00:14:47.495 --> 00:14:48.875
and he showed Peter Mercy,

272
00:14:52.755 --> 00:14:55.765
hear me friend, walk into that light today.

273
00:14:57.275 --> 00:15:01.125
Walk into that light today. You're not unlovable.

274
00:15:02.105 --> 00:15:03.525
You're not too far gone.

275
00:15:06.295 --> 00:15:11.285
Don't let your past consume the mercy that God wants

276
00:15:11.385 --> 00:15:13.485
to lavish on you today.

277
00:15:21.155 --> 00:15:24.285
There's another way that David's guilt showed up though

278
00:15:25.155 --> 00:15:26.565
here in Second Samuel.

279
00:15:28.265 --> 00:15:31.885
It had to do with Joe ab, his military commander.

280
00:15:32.945 --> 00:15:36.245
If you remember last week, David explicitly told his army,

281
00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:41.265
nobody touch Absalom Joab

282
00:15:41.265 --> 00:15:44.265
though explicitly disobeyed

283
00:15:45.765 --> 00:15:47.705
and took Absalom's life.

284
00:15:50.165 --> 00:15:53.585
Now, sadly, that wasn't the first time

285
00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:56.185
that Joab had killed a

286
00:15:56.185 --> 00:15:59.545
rival back in chapter three.

287
00:15:59.545 --> 00:16:03.065
It was Abner. It will happen again here in chapter 20

288
00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:04.465
with a man named Amasa.

289
00:16:06.805 --> 00:16:09.785
But here's the, here's what David knew about Joab.

290
00:16:10.955 --> 00:16:14.825
David knew that Joab was ruthless, he was ambitious

291
00:16:15.405 --> 00:16:16.785
and he was disobedient.

292
00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:24.025
And David understanding that did nothing about it.

293
00:16:25.715 --> 00:16:29.225
David did nothing about it. Why?

294
00:16:31.455 --> 00:16:34.705
Because Joab was David's accomplice

295
00:16:35.365 --> 00:16:37.705
in taking Uriah's life when he was

296
00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:38.785
trying to cover up his sin.

297
00:16:41.645 --> 00:16:43.745
He was who he sent to the front lines

298
00:16:43.855 --> 00:16:45.105
with the message right?

299
00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:47.705
Saying, Hey, let's get Uriah back and all these things.

300
00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:49.425
And knew what happened.

301
00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:51.545
On the other side of that, when Uriah went back

302
00:16:52.125 --> 00:16:55.665
to the battle, Joab knew too much.

303
00:17:00.355 --> 00:17:03.545
David was trapped by his past.

304
00:17:07.445 --> 00:17:09.425
Now, I'm not saying David didn't try to do some things

305
00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:11.945
to deal with this here in chapter 19.

306
00:17:12.045 --> 00:17:15.185
He just tried to replace Joab with this man named Ammas.

307
00:17:15.925 --> 00:17:18.785
And initially it seemed to work like I'm just gonna remove

308
00:17:18.895 --> 00:17:21.185
Joab and Ammas is gonna be my military commander now.

309
00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:23.785
And it seems like everything is fine until Joab just went

310
00:17:23.785 --> 00:17:25.945
and murdered Amsa and took his job back.

311
00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:35.065
Yet again, David said nothing. David did nothing.

312
00:17:37.885 --> 00:17:40.025
He could not execute justice

313
00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:44.785
because his hands were tied by guilt.

314
00:17:48.005 --> 00:17:52.005
Listen, this, this is the terrible bondage of secret

315
00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:53.905
Sin.

316
00:17:55.745 --> 00:17:58.205
It gives wicked people power over you

317
00:18:01.595 --> 00:18:05.135
and it makes you complicit in evils that you should condemn.

318
00:18:10.475 --> 00:18:11.975
And it's interesting you track

319
00:18:12.005 --> 00:18:13.375
David's life, we won't get there.

320
00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:15.135
It's past end of second Samuel.

321
00:18:16.715 --> 00:18:21.535
It wasn't until David's deathbed that he did anything about

322
00:18:22.085 --> 00:18:25.775
Joab, which isn't even anything

323
00:18:25.775 --> 00:18:29.775
because this is what One Kings chapter two says.

324
00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:33.335
This is David talking.

325
00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:37.015
Moreover, you also know what Joe ab, the son of Zeriah did

326
00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:39.975
to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies

327
00:18:39.975 --> 00:18:42.015
of Israel, Abner, the son of Ner

328
00:18:42.015 --> 00:18:45.655
and Amasa, the son of Jeer whom he killed avenging in time

329
00:18:45.655 --> 00:18:47.615
of peace for blood that had been shed in war,

330
00:18:47.645 --> 00:18:50.055
putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist

331
00:18:50.055 --> 00:18:51.255
and on the sandals of his feet,

332
00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:53.015
meaning he's just a ruthless man.

333
00:18:55.475 --> 00:18:57.615
Now, David says this, this is, he's talking

334
00:18:57.635 --> 00:19:00.175
to his son Solomon, who's now going to be the king.

335
00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:03.815
He says, act therefore, according to your wisdom,

336
00:19:04.155 --> 00:19:08.255
but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.

337
00:19:10.075 --> 00:19:12.575
So basically what David does on his deathbed is saying,

338
00:19:12.575 --> 00:19:14.095
Hey Solomon, you're the king.

339
00:19:14.095 --> 00:19:15.295
Now you deal with this.

340
00:19:17.885 --> 00:19:19.995
David was the king for decades

341
00:19:20.455 --> 00:19:21.555
and he didn't do anything about it.

342
00:19:21.955 --> 00:19:23.835
He says, Solomon, now you're the king. You deal with this.

343
00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:31.085
So for decades, David lived under the shadow of a man.

344
00:19:31.185 --> 00:19:33.845
He couldn't discipline because of shared guilt.

345
00:19:37.315 --> 00:19:40.285
Like what? Waste, what compromise.

346
00:19:44.235 --> 00:19:47.375
That's the point here, church, listen, do not let your past

347
00:19:48.265 --> 00:19:49.895
compromise God's plan.

348
00:19:53.435 --> 00:19:54.815
It can consume God's mercy.

349
00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:55.975
You can't feel loved by God,

350
00:19:55.975 --> 00:19:59.255
but it also can compromise God's plan in your life.

351
00:20:02.985 --> 00:20:07.975
Don't let your past compromise your ability to follow

352
00:20:08.355 --> 00:20:11.495
and obey what God wants you to do right now.

353
00:20:14.095 --> 00:20:16.185
What is God telling you? What is he commanding you?

354
00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.585
Don't let your past compromise that.

355
00:20:18.585 --> 00:20:20.425
Just, just think about this for a second.

356
00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:23.585
What sins in your past

357
00:20:24.165 --> 00:20:27.225
are giving someone power over you today?

358
00:20:30.815 --> 00:20:32.705
What compromises are you making

359
00:20:32.735 --> 00:20:34.305
because you're afraid of

360
00:20:34.305 --> 00:20:38.345
what could get exposed if you said anything about it?

361
00:20:41.805 --> 00:20:45.025
Listen, you cannot serve God faithfully

362
00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:47.605
by being blackmailed by your past.

363
00:20:50.665 --> 00:20:51.805
You're always gonna be stuck.

364
00:20:51.805 --> 00:20:55.005
You're always gonna be compromised in your ability to obey.

365
00:20:55.305 --> 00:20:59.125
And so what do you do with it? You bring it into light.

366
00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:01.685
You confess it fully.

367
00:21:01.825 --> 00:21:05.525
You break the power that guilt has over you.

368
00:21:05.785 --> 00:21:09.605
That's why I love what one John one says how he says it.

369
00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:11.365
One John one, seven through 10, listen to this.

370
00:21:12.985 --> 00:21:15.925
If we walk in the light as he is in the light,

371
00:21:16.065 --> 00:21:17.405
we have fellowship with one another

372
00:21:17.505 --> 00:21:20.925
and the blood of Jesus, his son cleanses us from all sin.

373
00:21:21.065 --> 00:21:24.005
If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.

374
00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:26.045
And the truth is not in us.

375
00:21:26.545 --> 00:21:29.165
If we confess our sins, he's faithful

376
00:21:29.165 --> 00:21:31.325
and just to forgive us our sins,

377
00:21:31.585 --> 00:21:33.485
to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

378
00:21:33.745 --> 00:21:36.525
If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar.

379
00:21:36.785 --> 00:21:38.845
And his word is not in us.

380
00:21:39.905 --> 00:21:43.325
We can't stand here, walk around, sit in a group

381
00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:44.405
and say, no, I'm good.

382
00:21:46.115 --> 00:21:48.845
None of us can. We're lying.

383
00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:52.765
We're making him a liar who said, no, you're all sinners.

384
00:21:53.705 --> 00:21:55.285
So let's just be okay with that.

385
00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:56.565
Like not okay with it in the sense

386
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:59.005
that we're gonna continue, but like we should be able

387
00:21:59.025 --> 00:22:01.805
to say, yeah, I'm broken.

388
00:22:03.595 --> 00:22:07.245
Yeah, I have sinned. And here's what it just said.

389
00:22:07.265 --> 00:22:11.005
Did you see Christ's blood doesn't just forgive?

390
00:22:11.465 --> 00:22:14.845
It also frees you from sins quicksand.

391
00:22:15.065 --> 00:22:18.405
So you can live in righteousness without fear of accusation.

392
00:22:19.865 --> 00:22:22.605
It cleanses you from all sin.

393
00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:27.925
And I know, listen, I know some of the stories in this room

394
00:22:28.355 --> 00:22:32.245
that you're sitting there like I was 20 years ago,

395
00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:35.845
that the longer you let it go on

396
00:22:36.465 --> 00:22:39.045
and don't say anything about it, the harder

397
00:22:39.305 --> 00:22:41.565
and more painful it is to confess it.

398
00:22:42.965 --> 00:22:47.125
I understand. But you cannot

399
00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:49.245
walk in the freedom

400
00:22:49.515 --> 00:22:52.645
that Christ offers you if you keep hiding it.

401
00:22:57.625 --> 00:23:00.605
So friend, walk into that light today.

402
00:23:01.595 --> 00:23:05.765
Walk into the light. You're not defined by your past.

403
00:23:05.945 --> 00:23:08.005
If you're in Christ, you're not defined

404
00:23:08.005 --> 00:23:09.325
by somebody else's past.

405
00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:13.005
If you're in Christ, you can walk into the light

406
00:23:13.105 --> 00:23:16.285
and you can be free in Christ.

407
00:23:22.435 --> 00:23:25.925
There's one more thing that this passage should remind us

408
00:23:25.925 --> 00:23:28.405
of today, and it points us from their perspective.

409
00:23:28.405 --> 00:23:32.925
Points us forward. See, we know from what,

410
00:23:33.435 --> 00:23:36.365
what, uh, David did in Second Samuel.

411
00:23:36.505 --> 00:23:38.645
He confessed it, right? We have Psalm 51.

412
00:23:39.625 --> 00:23:41.965
He confessed the sins against Bathsheba and Uriah.

413
00:23:42.025 --> 00:23:43.365
And in second Samuel 12,

414
00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:45.365
the prophet Nathan pronounced forgiveness.

415
00:23:47.265 --> 00:23:49.485
But the consequences continued.

416
00:23:52.145 --> 00:23:55.965
The guilt lingered. The compromises multiplied.

417
00:23:58.025 --> 00:24:02.165
Why? Because the old covenant

418
00:24:02.965 --> 00:24:06.365
sacrifices could never take

419
00:24:06.755 --> 00:24:08.085
away sins.

420
00:24:10.875 --> 00:24:15.085
It's what Hebrews 10, four says, that it is impossible

421
00:24:15.785 --> 00:24:19.365
for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

422
00:24:21.065 --> 00:24:23.405
That's what David would've done in, in light of his sin,

423
00:24:23.405 --> 00:24:25.845
he would've sacrificed a bunch of things and and,

424
00:24:26.025 --> 00:24:28.125
but it could never take it away.

425
00:24:28.185 --> 00:24:31.205
And then they had to repeatedly offer the same sacrifices

426
00:24:31.205 --> 00:24:33.925
each year, each year, each sin, each sin.

427
00:24:33.925 --> 00:24:35.645
They had to keep doing that.

428
00:24:35.865 --> 00:24:36.925
All that didn't work

429
00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:40.445
because those sacrifices were a mere shadows.

430
00:24:40.555 --> 00:24:43.845
They were pointing forward to something greater.

431
00:24:45.855 --> 00:24:48.485
David needed what he didn't have.

432
00:24:48.705 --> 00:24:52.405
Yet he needed a sacrifice

433
00:24:53.445 --> 00:24:57.445
powerful enough to actually clean the conscience.

434
00:24:59.505 --> 00:25:02.325
It would take away the eternal effect of sin.

435
00:25:02.325 --> 00:25:04.605
That's why they were doing that in the sacrifices.

436
00:25:04.625 --> 00:25:09.605
But as Hebrews nine 14 says, how much more will the blood

437
00:25:09.665 --> 00:25:10.965
of Christ who

438
00:25:10.965 --> 00:25:14.805
through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish

439
00:25:14.805 --> 00:25:19.725
to God, purify our conscience from dead works

440
00:25:19.945 --> 00:25:22.045
to serve the living God?

441
00:25:23.225 --> 00:25:27.415
See, that's what David needed and that's what you

442
00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:30.455
and I need to be reminded of every day.

443
00:25:30.555 --> 00:25:34.895
Here's the truth. Your past is cleansed by Christ's blood.

444
00:25:37.485 --> 00:25:41.415
Your past, if you are in Christ, is cleansed

445
00:25:41.955 --> 00:25:43.815
by Christ's blood.

446
00:25:46.035 --> 00:25:48.295
That's what one John one seven said. Remember that?

447
00:25:48.555 --> 00:25:53.175
It said The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin,

448
00:25:53.355 --> 00:25:54.455
not merely covers it,

449
00:25:54.755 --> 00:25:58.295
not merely just hides it, it cleanses it.

450
00:25:58.475 --> 00:26:01.855
It removes it completely from our lives.

451
00:26:02.155 --> 00:26:04.575
And listen, I know right now even

452
00:26:07.515 --> 00:26:09.695
or today, later or tomorrow or tonight

453
00:26:09.695 --> 00:26:14.495
or the next week, I know the enemy is gonna sit there

454
00:26:14.755 --> 00:26:18.175
and just come after you over and over and over.

455
00:26:18.405 --> 00:26:20.415
He's accusing you of all the things

456
00:26:20.415 --> 00:26:21.535
you've done in your past.

457
00:26:21.755 --> 00:26:24.935
And I want you to be honest with this, right? He's right.

458
00:26:26.955 --> 00:26:28.335
You did all that stuff, didn't you?

459
00:26:29.915 --> 00:26:31.295
If you sit there and said, no, I didn't do that.

460
00:26:31.295 --> 00:26:33.855
He's like, I got the receipts right here, man.

461
00:26:38.035 --> 00:26:40.085
He's gonna accuse you. He's going to say,

462
00:26:40.085 --> 00:26:41.205
you did this, you did that.

463
00:26:41.305 --> 00:26:45.205
You did this, you did that. And you have to say, yep, I did.

464
00:26:48.265 --> 00:26:52.725
That's why one John two is such good news.

465
00:26:53.285 --> 00:26:54.525
'cause listen to this one John two

466
00:26:54.525 --> 00:26:55.725
verse one, my little children.

467
00:26:56.105 --> 00:26:57.765
I'm writing these things to you so

468
00:26:57.765 --> 00:27:00.485
that you may not sin, I guess the goal.

469
00:27:00.505 --> 00:27:04.965
Oh, but if anyone does sin,

470
00:27:05.945 --> 00:27:08.125
we have an advocate with the Father,

471
00:27:08.535 --> 00:27:10.405
Jesus Christ, the righteous.

472
00:27:11.425 --> 00:27:12.685
And verse two goes on to say

473
00:27:12.685 --> 00:27:15.045
that He is the propitiation for our sins.

474
00:27:15.045 --> 00:27:17.245
A big theological word that means the all sufficient

475
00:27:17.245 --> 00:27:18.965
payment for our sins.

476
00:27:19.105 --> 00:27:20.725
The sacrifice of the Old Testament

477
00:27:20.725 --> 00:27:22.005
could never take away sins.

478
00:27:22.215 --> 00:27:25.365
Jesus, the propitiation that is sufficient.

479
00:27:25.625 --> 00:27:28.005
He did take away sins.

480
00:27:28.195 --> 00:27:30.365
That means, hear me, the guilt is gone,

481
00:27:31.185 --> 00:27:35.165
the debt has been paid, the conscience is purified,

482
00:27:35.305 --> 00:27:39.525
and you are now free to serve the Lord without fear

483
00:27:39.525 --> 00:27:42.885
of accusation, without shame of your past.

484
00:27:43.105 --> 00:27:47.245
Why? Because the perfect blood of Christ was shed for you.

485
00:27:50.675 --> 00:27:52.445
This is the problem David couldn't solve.

486
00:27:55.385 --> 00:27:58.725
And this is the problem that your good works can't solve.

487
00:28:00.195 --> 00:28:03.045
This is the problem that your church attendance can't solve.

488
00:28:03.715 --> 00:28:07.125
This is the problem that your morality can't solve.

489
00:28:08.625 --> 00:28:11.885
The only path forward out of sin and guilt

490
00:28:11.945 --> 00:28:16.605
and shame is through the blood of Christ, through the life,

491
00:28:16.775 --> 00:28:19.565
death, and resurrection of Jesus in your place.

492
00:28:19.625 --> 00:28:22.965
That's the only way out of sin and guilt and shame.

493
00:28:23.225 --> 00:28:24.485
And so hear me today.

494
00:28:24.505 --> 00:28:28.685
If you are in Christ, stop punishing yourself for sins

495
00:28:28.715 --> 00:28:30.245
that Christ has already covered.

496
00:28:31.435 --> 00:28:33.125
Amen. He's already carried those.

497
00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:35.085
You don't have to carry those anymore.

498
00:28:35.355 --> 00:28:37.525
Stop living under the shadow of guilt

499
00:28:37.635 --> 00:28:39.925
that his blood has already covered.

500
00:28:43.415 --> 00:28:45.815
There'll be grief, there'll be consequences,

501
00:28:46.395 --> 00:28:47.655
yes for your sin.

502
00:28:50.745 --> 00:28:55.245
But Romans eight, one says, there is now no condemnation

503
00:28:55.545 --> 00:28:56.805
for those who are in Christ Jesus.

504
00:28:57.995 --> 00:29:01.245
Like there's guilt and consequence, yes,

505
00:29:01.665 --> 00:29:03.125
but there's no condemnation.

506
00:29:03.235 --> 00:29:06.245
There's no shame anymore if you are in Christ

507
00:29:07.915 --> 00:29:10.125
because of his blood shed for you.

508
00:29:16.065 --> 00:29:18.925
We often, when we read through the Bible, we get to the end

509
00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:20.285
of the Old Testament and there's all these,

510
00:29:20.355 --> 00:29:25.085
what they call minor prophets, a lot of prophecies,

511
00:29:25.205 --> 00:29:27.165
a lot of hard things and images,

512
00:29:27.345 --> 00:29:29.365
and it's really difficult to understand at times.

513
00:29:30.225 --> 00:29:31.845
And so we kind of skate over those

514
00:29:31.985 --> 00:29:34.125
and don't really get into what's there.

515
00:29:35.985 --> 00:29:38.365
But one of my favorite scenes in the whole Bible

516
00:29:39.305 --> 00:29:42.325
is found in the often overlooked prophet named Zechariah.

517
00:29:44.765 --> 00:29:46.445
I wanna briefly paint the picture for you.

518
00:29:46.475 --> 00:29:48.165
It's in chapter three. You can read it later.

519
00:29:48.225 --> 00:29:50.725
But there's this vision, Zechariah receives.

520
00:29:52.545 --> 00:29:55.445
And in this vision, he sees Joshua, the high priest,

521
00:29:57.165 --> 00:29:59.085
standing before the angel of the Lord, kind of

522
00:29:59.285 --> 00:30:01.885
before the throne of God, you might say in a sense.

523
00:30:03.065 --> 00:30:07.445
And and Joshua is clothed in just these filthy robes.

524
00:30:08.885 --> 00:30:10.415
Like his clothes are just nasty.

525
00:30:10.605 --> 00:30:12.855
He's dirty, he's standing before God,

526
00:30:13.355 --> 00:30:15.335
and he's in these dirty clothes.

527
00:30:15.335 --> 00:30:18.655
And it's this picture of sin, guilt, stained leadership

528
00:30:19.355 --> 00:30:20.495
and a lot of that involved.

529
00:30:20.495 --> 00:30:22.375
But, but just imagine that picture.

530
00:30:24.755 --> 00:30:28.855
And Satan, the enemy of our souls, is standing right next

531
00:30:28.855 --> 00:30:32.855
to him, ready to accuse Joshua of all the past,

532
00:30:32.955 --> 00:30:35.095
all the nasty, all the guilt, all the things.

533
00:30:38.715 --> 00:30:42.375
But what's interesting is that God does not

534
00:30:43.215 --> 00:30:44.535
minimize the filth.

535
00:30:48.325 --> 00:30:50.295
Like God doesn't look at, ah, it's not that bad.

536
00:30:52.985 --> 00:30:57.405
He doesn't say that. Instead, this is what God commands.

537
00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:01.445
And the angel said to those who are standing

538
00:31:01.445 --> 00:31:04.805
before him, remove the filthy garments from him.

539
00:31:06.305 --> 00:31:08.445
And to Joshua, he said, behold,

540
00:31:08.645 --> 00:31:10.765
I have taken your iniquity away from you,

541
00:31:10.985 --> 00:31:15.445
and I will clothe you with pure S

542
00:31:16.315 --> 00:31:18.805
pure closed, clean, closed.

543
00:31:18.805 --> 00:31:20.845
Listen, is that not a picture of grace?

544
00:31:23.925 --> 00:31:26.615
Like God doesn't ignore your sin.

545
00:31:30.145 --> 00:31:32.085
He actually removes it

546
00:31:32.745 --> 00:31:36.045
and replaces it with something spotless,

547
00:31:36.315 --> 00:31:37.485
with something pure.

548
00:31:39.635 --> 00:31:42.575
He takes away our sinful heart of stone

549
00:31:42.795 --> 00:31:44.815
and he gives us a heart of flesh

550
00:31:45.075 --> 00:31:48.095
so we can have a relationship with him, so we can love him,

551
00:31:48.235 --> 00:31:49.335
so we can obey him.

552
00:31:49.475 --> 00:31:53.815
He takes away our filthy rags of life that we've lived,

553
00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:57.735
and he cloth us with the perfect blood of Jesus.

554
00:31:58.915 --> 00:32:02.655
That's what David needed, and that's what we need.

555
00:32:04.445 --> 00:32:07.655
Because You saw what happened when David had unresolved

556
00:32:07.655 --> 00:32:12.175
guilt and unconfessed sin and all the consequences piled up.

557
00:32:12.395 --> 00:32:15.815
You saw what happened when that's the way we live our lives.

558
00:32:16.115 --> 00:32:20.415
But when Christ's blood shows us something infinitely

559
00:32:20.415 --> 00:32:22.215
better, he shows us something

560
00:32:22.285 --> 00:32:24.095
that we can't have any other way.

561
00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:28.255
He shows us total forgiveness, complete cleansing, the power

562
00:32:28.515 --> 00:32:31.775
to serve God with a clean conscience.

563
00:32:32.045 --> 00:32:33.735
When all of that is seen, listen,

564
00:32:34.145 --> 00:32:37.095
don't waste another day mourning over sins

565
00:32:37.125 --> 00:32:39.605
that Jesus has already carried to the grave.

566
00:32:42.225 --> 00:32:44.245
The blood of Christ is sufficient.

567
00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:47.645
So walk in it, rejoice in it,

568
00:32:47.985 --> 00:32:50.765
and be free in it today.

569
00:32:53.865 --> 00:32:55.285
Listen, here's how we're gonna respond.

570
00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:58.965
There is no better picture of what

571
00:32:59.155 --> 00:33:01.845
that just told us than the Lord's Supper.

572
00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:08.165
When you hold those elements of

573
00:33:08.975 --> 00:33:13.445
juice and a cracker, they're meant to illustrate

574
00:33:14.705 --> 00:33:15.885
the broken body

575
00:33:16.145 --> 00:33:19.725
and shed blood of Jesus for you.

576
00:33:23.145 --> 00:33:24.965
And so if you're serving Lord stuff, I wanna go ahead

577
00:33:24.965 --> 00:33:26.885
and ask you to go ahead and begin to serve that,

578
00:33:26.955 --> 00:33:28.685
because that means people are gonna be moving around.

579
00:33:28.685 --> 00:33:29.965
And I don't want that to happen here in

580
00:33:29.965 --> 00:33:31.005
a second for what we're gonna do.

581
00:33:32.665 --> 00:33:35.045
And so as they're preparing, this is for believers.

582
00:33:35.105 --> 00:33:37.005
If you are a follower of Christ, if you said,

583
00:33:37.005 --> 00:33:38.405
Jesus, I need you in my place.

584
00:33:38.525 --> 00:33:40.645
I need your blood to cover my sin. This is for you.

585
00:33:42.945 --> 00:33:44.285
But here's what I want us to do.

586
00:33:44.285 --> 00:33:46.525
While we're receiving the elements for the next few minutes,

587
00:33:49.405 --> 00:33:50.445
I talked a lot about guilt.

588
00:33:53.105 --> 00:33:56.445
And I know because I'm just like you,

589
00:33:57.915 --> 00:33:59.325
that there's stuff that there's,

590
00:33:59.325 --> 00:34:01.285
that's cropping up in your soul right now.

591
00:34:02.515 --> 00:34:05.245
There's things that you have dealt with and are dealing with

592
00:34:05.265 --> 00:34:08.605
and and I just want this moment to be quiet for you,

593
00:34:08.745 --> 00:34:10.245
to receive those elements

594
00:34:10.305 --> 00:34:14.765
and to reflect on

595
00:34:14.785 --> 00:34:16.645
who Jesus is and what He's done for you.

596
00:34:18.015 --> 00:34:21.275
So as you receive the elements, let's reflect quietly.

597
00:34:21.275 --> 00:34:23.235
Maybe your head bowed, eyes closed, just you

598
00:34:23.235 --> 00:34:26.835
and Jesus taking time to deal with where you are in that.
