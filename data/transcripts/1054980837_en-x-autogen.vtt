WEBVTT

1
00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:20.535
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:24.295
It is a joy to be with you today to see you here.

3
00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:26.775
If you're new to our church especially, we are honored

4
00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:28.095
that you take that step of faith.

5
00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:29.935
We'd love to meet you. Uh,

6
00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:31.455
there's a new here area out there in the lobby.

7
00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:33.055
And just to introduce yourself

8
00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:36.415
and us, to introduce ourselves to you, love to get that

9
00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:38.255
together if we can.

10
00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:40.295
Today though, we're continuing our series

11
00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:41.655
through the book of one Samuel.

12
00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:43.735
It's called He Shall Reign.

13
00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:47.415
And we're gonna be in chapter 22 today, one Samuel 22.

14
00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:49.655
So if you're not there already, go ahead and turn there.

15
00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:51.615
One Samuel 22.

16
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:57.295
Now this morning's sermon will be kind of a tough one.

17
00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:00.135
Uh, some questions will be raised.

18
00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:04.015
Uh, we'll see very blatant evil in the text.

19
00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:08.295
We'll have to think pretty deeply about some things.

20
00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:11.775
And so I think it'd be good for us to pray

21
00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:15.415
before we get too far into this to ask the Lord to teach us,

22
00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:17.935
uh, where we need to understand and

23
00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:19.455
and to, to give us trust

24
00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:23.055
where we can't understand some things today.

25
00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:25.815
So pray with me. God, thank you for your word,

26
00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:29.415
that we don't have to wonder who you are

27
00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:31.895
or wonder about you.

28
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.815
Even though you are incomprehensible, you are

29
00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:36.575
beyond our understanding.

30
00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:41.335
We don't have to wonder about your character

31
00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:42.335
and about your nature.

32
00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:45.135
And you've shown us that you've taught us that.

33
00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:47.415
So teach us from your word Holy Spirit.

34
00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:50.375
Teach us in the deepest parts of who we are. Change us.

35
00:01:51.685 --> 00:01:54.375
Open our eyes to see what we need to see today

36
00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:58.015
and give us trust where we can't fully comprehend it.

37
00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:00.495
In Jesus' name. Amen.

38
00:02:02.675 --> 00:02:04.855
So if you remember where we're at in this narrative,

39
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.975
we remember David, he's on the run from King Saul.

40
00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:11.575
'cause King Saul is jealous of God's anointing on David at

41
00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:14.775
as Saul's replacement as the king of Israel.

42
00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:18.495
And so Saul is after him trying to kill him.

43
00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:21.975
And last week we saw David make some questionable decisions

44
00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.255
as he was running from Saul.

45
00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:27.615
He appeared to trust his own craftiness rather than

46
00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:30.215
trusting God fully.

47
00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:33.335
He stretched the truth with the priest.

48
00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:37.255
He did some things to manipulate others, it seems.

49
00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:40.415
And so we see that, that he did that and,

50
00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:42.855
and the consequences of those actions didn't show up

51
00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:45.815
immediately, but they do today

52
00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:49.575
and we'll see 'em very clearly here today.

53
00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:51.995
So look at what we see here.

54
00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:55.075
This is what we see in the text.

55
00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:58.115
We just walk through it and a piece by piece will get there.

56
00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:00.485
But, but what happened now

57
00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:02.725
that David had been sent back into Judah,

58
00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:04.725
he'd fled to other nations.

59
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.245
The pre the, the prophet told him to go back to Judah.

60
00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:11.565
And so he has now, he's growing in his trust of the Lord.

61
00:03:11.595 --> 00:03:12.925
What do we see happen here?

62
00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:15.285
Well, first we see a king in turmoil.

63
00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:21.085
We'll see a king in turmoil as we start this passage,

64
00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:25.365
one Samuel 22, starting in verse six through verse eight.

65
00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:30.605
Now Saul heard that David was discovered,

66
00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:32.365
meaning he'd shown himself

67
00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:33.605
and the men who were with him,

68
00:03:34.555 --> 00:03:37.285
Saul was sitting at Gibbon under the Tamara tree on the

69
00:03:37.285 --> 00:03:40.125
height with his spear in his hand, which we've seen

70
00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.565
that's not going well at any point in this story.

71
00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:45.285
But all his servants were standing about him

72
00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:47.005
and Saul said to his servants,

73
00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:49.885
who stood about him here Now people of Benjamin,

74
00:03:50.035 --> 00:03:52.045
will the son of Jesse give every one

75
00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:53.445
of you fields and vineyards?

76
00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:56.165
Will he make you all commanders of thousands

77
00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:59.125
and commanders of hundreds that all

78
00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:01.125
of you have conspired against me?

79
00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:04.045
No one discloses

80
00:04:04.045 --> 00:04:06.725
to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse.

81
00:04:07.835 --> 00:04:09.245
None of you is sorry for me

82
00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:10.605
or discloses to me

83
00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:13.925
that my son has stirred up my servant against me

84
00:04:14.265 --> 00:04:16.685
to lie in weight as at this day.

85
00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:21.485
So you see Saul, he's in turmoil here, right?

86
00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:27.325
First he accused his troops of conspiring against him

87
00:04:28.465 --> 00:04:30.405
and he's tossing around these ideas

88
00:04:30.405 --> 00:04:32.405
of bribes all over the place

89
00:04:32.665 --> 00:04:35.205
as if he was some other nation's king

90
00:04:35.205 --> 00:04:36.805
because that's the way they worked.

91
00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:40.805
He was talking about like any other nation would follow

92
00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:42.685
their gods, not Yahweh.

93
00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:44.765
They would use bribes. They would use manipulation.

94
00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:47.245
And he's talking about as if that's the way David

95
00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:48.565
and he were even doing it.

96
00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:53.375
But then he also comes across as pretty whiny, doesn't he?

97
00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:55.175
Like he's almost pouting here.

98
00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:59.695
You can imagine like a a a baby crying

99
00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:00.895
and that kind of feeling

100
00:05:00.915 --> 00:05:03.175
and the sound like nobody told me about Jonathan

101
00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:04.455
and David, right?

102
00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:06.855
Nobody told me nobody feels bad for me.

103
00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:09.455
Like he's just whining to his troops here.

104
00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:13.095
But he was wrong, right? Because David was not

105
00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:14.335
trying to kill him.

106
00:05:15.595 --> 00:05:17.025
David could have, but he didn't.

107
00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:19.705
Saul was just paranoid thinking, I'm about

108
00:05:19.705 --> 00:05:20.705
to lose my position.

109
00:05:20.815 --> 00:05:23.505
He's paranoid. And so he is

110
00:05:24.135 --> 00:05:27.375
whining, he's in turmoil.

111
00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:30.415
But then verse nine we'll get to in a moment calls back

112
00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:31.575
to something we almost kind

113
00:05:31.575 --> 00:05:34.255
of skipped over last week in chapter 21

114
00:05:35.525 --> 00:05:39.055
that there was a soldier who did know,

115
00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:42.815
like there was a soldier in the know, at least partially.

116
00:05:42.815 --> 00:05:44.135
We'll figure that out here in a second.

117
00:05:44.235 --> 00:05:47.895
But, but he was saying nobody told me there was one person

118
00:05:48.435 --> 00:05:50.095
in his army who did know.

119
00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:52.545
Look at verses nine and 10

120
00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:58.805
then answered dog, the mite who stood

121
00:05:58.865 --> 00:06:00.405
by the servants of Saul.

122
00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:04.925
I saw the son of Jesse coming to Knob to a Alek, the son

123
00:06:04.925 --> 00:06:05.925
of a, a high tube.

124
00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:09.485
And he inquired to the Lord for him and gave him provisions

125
00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:12.565
and gave him the sword of Goliath, the Philistine.

126
00:06:14.635 --> 00:06:17.415
Now you remember last week when David goes

127
00:06:17.415 --> 00:06:20.815
to visit the priest, there was this one little verse kind

128
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:21.855
of in the middle of everything

129
00:06:21.855 --> 00:06:24.335
that we didn't really look too deeply.

130
00:06:24.595 --> 00:06:26.535
It introduced a character out of nowhere.

131
00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:29.055
This was chapter 21 verse seven.

132
00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:32.975
As David comes to knob, now, a certain man of the servants

133
00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:37.015
of Saul was there that day detained before the Lord.

134
00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:41.895
His name was dog Dite, the chief of Saul's herdsman.

135
00:06:43.565 --> 00:06:45.345
So it doesn't really tell us why,

136
00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:49.745
but what we know is that dog was there in knob when David

137
00:06:49.855 --> 00:06:53.785
came to the priest asking for food and asking for weapons.

138
00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:57.705
And so that's what Doug told Saul here in chapter 22, right?

139
00:06:57.735 --> 00:07:01.025
He's like, I saw him, but the way he said it

140
00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:05.625
to Saul made the priest a alek sound like a conspirator.

141
00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:10.425
Uh, he was in on it. He was given Saul weapons

142
00:07:10.725 --> 00:07:12.425
or given David weapons giving David food.

143
00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:13.665
He was in on it.

144
00:07:13.765 --> 00:07:16.345
But we as readers, we know that wasn't true, right?

145
00:07:18.035 --> 00:07:19.225
There was no collusion.

146
00:07:20.635 --> 00:07:23.775
It was David stretching the truth that Alek was just doing

147
00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:25.335
what he was supposed to do.

148
00:07:26.075 --> 00:07:29.095
But then notice when do reports it to Saul,

149
00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:34.055
he adds an element saying the priest inquired of the Lord

150
00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:36.875
for David, which we don't really know

151
00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:37.915
if that actually happened or not.

152
00:07:38.975 --> 00:07:40.635
It doesn't say that in chapter 21.

153
00:07:42.945 --> 00:07:45.165
Now here's how it might have come about.

154
00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:47.645
It may have been that

155
00:07:47.795 --> 00:07:51.045
because Goliath sword, you remember in chapter 21,

156
00:07:51.045 --> 00:07:55.605
Goliaths sword was wrapped in the efo, this this uh,

157
00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:59.645
fabric that they would use to actually inquire of the Lord.

158
00:08:01.185 --> 00:08:03.885
So when maybe do saw all of that happen,

159
00:08:04.305 --> 00:08:05.765
the Goliaths sword he knew was in there

160
00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:08.125
and it came out with the efo unwrapped.

161
00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:12.485
That's maybe why he assumed Alek had inquired of the Lord.

162
00:08:12.705 --> 00:08:14.925
But that's actually a really important piece

163
00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:19.405
of the puzzle here because what was common

164
00:08:19.575 --> 00:08:24.045
among the kings in that time in the nations around them was

165
00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:28.485
that the king had to know every time someone inquired

166
00:08:28.505 --> 00:08:29.525
of their gods,

167
00:08:32.275 --> 00:08:34.885
like anybody in the whole nation, if they inquired

168
00:08:34.885 --> 00:08:36.365
of the God, the king better know about it.

169
00:08:36.785 --> 00:08:39.565
So when Dogue said that ah, Alek had inquired of God

170
00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:45.385
without Saul knowing about it, that infuriated Saul,

171
00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:48.805
which again proved

172
00:08:48.805 --> 00:08:52.645
that Saul was acting like every other nation's king

173
00:08:54.105 --> 00:08:58.305
except the way Yahweh wanted him to act, right?

174
00:08:58.415 --> 00:09:00.945
Saul at this point had become exactly

175
00:09:01.055 --> 00:09:04.025
what Samuel had warned the people the king was going

176
00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:05.505
to become back in chapter eight.

177
00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:09.105
Remember Samuel said, Hey guys, this is what's

178
00:09:09.105 --> 00:09:10.145
gonna happen if you let this happen.

179
00:09:10.165 --> 00:09:13.665
If this Saul, if a king comes, here's how it's gonna go.

180
00:09:14.335 --> 00:09:17.345
Saul is the picture of what he was warning them about.

181
00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:21.925
He'd become like every other king.

182
00:09:24.255 --> 00:09:25.825
Well watch how Saul responded.

183
00:09:25.825 --> 00:09:30.105
Now verses 11 through 15, he's brought the priest in

184
00:09:31.165 --> 00:09:32.225
who was involved with David.

185
00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:36.145
Look at verse 11. Then the king sent to summon a Alek,

186
00:09:36.145 --> 00:09:38.545
the priest, the son of a high, a high tube,

187
00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:40.105
and all his father's house.

188
00:09:40.525 --> 00:09:45.505
The priests who were at knob, all of them came to the king.

189
00:09:45.565 --> 00:09:46.865
That's important in a moment.

190
00:09:48.945 --> 00:09:50.925
And Saul said, he's speaking just

191
00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:53.205
to the one priest here now son of a high tube.

192
00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:54.885
And he answered, here I am my Lord.

193
00:09:54.905 --> 00:09:59.165
And Saul said to him, why have you conspired against me,

194
00:10:00.025 --> 00:10:02.765
you and the son of Jesse, that you have given him bread

195
00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:06.765
and a sword and have inquired of God for him so

196
00:10:06.765 --> 00:10:08.165
that he has risen against me

197
00:10:08.505 --> 00:10:10.445
to lie in weight as at this day.

198
00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:13.905
And Alek answered the king.

199
00:10:14.845 --> 00:10:18.105
And who among all your servants is so faithful as David,

200
00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:22.625
who is the king's son-in-law and captain over your bodyguard

201
00:10:22.845 --> 00:10:24.145
and honored in your house?

202
00:10:25.505 --> 00:10:28.045
Is today the first time that I've inquired of God for him?

203
00:10:28.305 --> 00:10:31.365
No, let not the king impute anything to his servant

204
00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:33.045
or to all the house of my father,

205
00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.605
for your servant has known nothing

206
00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:38.125
of all this much or little.

207
00:10:40.155 --> 00:10:43.215
And so what we see is the questioning of the priest, right?

208
00:10:43.215 --> 00:10:45.895
The priest comes in and he's a priest in question.

209
00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:49.175
He's getting grilled by King Saul,

210
00:10:50.365 --> 00:10:52.655
similarly accusing him of conspiracy

211
00:10:54.775 --> 00:10:56.905
wrongly assuming David's after Saul.

212
00:10:57.005 --> 00:10:59.665
And so he's like, everybody's against me. Who is involved?

213
00:10:59.675 --> 00:11:02.145
Let's go after them. So

214
00:11:02.145 --> 00:11:05.895
how the priest respond though, you see it right?

215
00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:07.895
There was, there was a clear respect for David.

216
00:11:09.155 --> 00:11:11.255
He knew David was this honored man,

217
00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:14.335
but then almost sarcastically to Saul,

218
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:16.375
he denies all the charges.

219
00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:22.215
I didn't do it, man. Like why? Why would you think I would?

220
00:11:23.745 --> 00:11:24.925
And he wasn't lying, right?

221
00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.205
He, he wasn't trying to cover his, he had no need

222
00:11:27.205 --> 00:11:28.245
to cover his tracks.

223
00:11:28.585 --> 00:11:29.885
He had done nothing wrong.

224
00:11:31.725 --> 00:11:34.145
He was upstanding in everything he had done.

225
00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:36.105
There was nothing to hide.

226
00:11:40.355 --> 00:11:43.305
Sadly though, watch the fury of the king.

227
00:11:45.535 --> 00:11:48.235
We see next a king respond in

228
00:11:48.505 --> 00:11:53.505
fury starting in verse 16.

229
00:11:55.995 --> 00:12:00.895
And the king said, you shall surely die a alek you

230
00:12:01.035 --> 00:12:02.575
and all your father's house.

231
00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:06.935
And the king said to the guard who stood about him turn

232
00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:08.375
and kill the priest of the Lord

233
00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:11.175
because their hand also is with David.

234
00:12:11.315 --> 00:12:14.415
And they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me.

235
00:12:16.085 --> 00:12:19.305
But the servants of the king would not put out their hand

236
00:12:19.485 --> 00:12:21.105
to strike the priests of the Lord.

237
00:12:23.615 --> 00:12:27.075
And so the king said to do you turn and strike the priests

238
00:12:27.175 --> 00:12:28.395
and do the mite turned

239
00:12:28.455 --> 00:12:30.715
and struck down the priests and he killed.

240
00:12:30.815 --> 00:12:34.795
On that day, 85 persons who wore the linen iffa

241
00:12:35.935 --> 00:12:38.875
and knob, the city of the priest, he put to the sword,

242
00:12:39.145 --> 00:12:41.075
both man and woman, child

243
00:12:41.255 --> 00:12:44.195
and infant, ox, donkey and sheep.

244
00:12:44.535 --> 00:12:45.555
He put to the sword

245
00:12:50.765 --> 00:12:51.655
like, what a tragedy.

246
00:12:51.745 --> 00:12:55.745
Isn't it such

247
00:12:56.065 --> 00:12:59.145
destruction, suffering?

248
00:13:03.655 --> 00:13:05.895
I said it last week. Sin has consequences.

249
00:13:09.525 --> 00:13:11.585
And it's interesting that Saul's soldiers

250
00:13:13.265 --> 00:13:16.505
seemingly had more fear of the Lord than Saul did.

251
00:13:18.035 --> 00:13:19.325
They wouldn't touch the priests.

252
00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:23.595
They, they knew they were supposed to stay away from that.

253
00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.475
And they were, they weren't gonna touch the

254
00:13:25.475 --> 00:13:26.795
priest but but do.

255
00:13:26.965 --> 00:13:31.115
Right? Seeing an opportunity to curry favor with the king,

256
00:13:32.695 --> 00:13:34.635
he gladly executed the king's orders

257
00:13:37.055 --> 00:13:39.435
and many, many people died.

258
00:13:44.255 --> 00:13:47.555
See, this is why we read the whole Bible in context.

259
00:13:48.045 --> 00:13:52.755
Sadly, Saul did to the priests of Yahweh

260
00:13:53.585 --> 00:13:56.755
what he wouldn't do with the Amalekites.

261
00:13:56.775 --> 00:14:01.275
If you remember back in chapter 15, the enemies

262
00:14:01.275 --> 00:14:04.355
of God who God said wipe them out,

263
00:14:05.725 --> 00:14:07.415
Saul was like, nah, I don't, I don't need,

264
00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:10.695
but he does it with the priests of God.

265
00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.095
Like you see how far he's fallen.

266
00:14:17.215 --> 00:14:19.835
But here's the thing, we, we look at scenes like this

267
00:14:20.095 --> 00:14:24.235
and it's really easy for us to judge the supposed fairness

268
00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:25.875
of a situation like this.

269
00:14:26.175 --> 00:14:27.955
And it's tragic. We'll come back to that in a second.

270
00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:29.355
But we can't forget something.

271
00:14:29.805 --> 00:14:32.115
Again, we read in context something happened early

272
00:14:32.375 --> 00:14:33.515
in First Samuel.

273
00:14:35.815 --> 00:14:38.555
Do you remember who the priest was at the very beginning

274
00:14:38.775 --> 00:14:40.195
of the book of one Samuel?

275
00:14:41.935 --> 00:14:46.835
It was Eli. And he had two sons

276
00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:48.795
who were also priests.

277
00:14:50.685 --> 00:14:54.485
And those sons, if you remember, were incredibly wicked.

278
00:14:55.915 --> 00:14:57.405
Like they were stealing from people

279
00:14:57.505 --> 00:14:58.805
as they brought offerings.

280
00:14:58.805 --> 00:15:01.445
There was rampant sexual immorality all over the place.

281
00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:03.605
And the Bible even claims

282
00:15:03.675 --> 00:15:05.805
that they were called worthless men.

283
00:15:06.595 --> 00:15:09.205
They did not even know the Lord.

284
00:15:09.305 --> 00:15:13.965
It says like priests in the temp tabernacle

285
00:15:14.475 --> 00:15:15.645
says they didn't even know God.

286
00:15:16.555 --> 00:15:17.725
They were worthless.

287
00:15:20.155 --> 00:15:22.015
And so what it talked about, if you remember,

288
00:15:22.035 --> 00:15:25.095
was God held wrath toward them

289
00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:28.215
and toward Eli as a result of their actions,

290
00:15:29.425 --> 00:15:31.135
their total disregard for God.

291
00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:33.415
There was wrath toward them.

292
00:15:33.635 --> 00:15:36.695
And one Samuel 2 25 says it was God's will

293
00:15:36.995 --> 00:15:39.255
to put those priests to death.

294
00:15:42.425 --> 00:15:45.925
But that wasn't all we, we get it.

295
00:15:45.925 --> 00:15:48.205
Like that's what they should have deserved for

296
00:15:48.205 --> 00:15:49.725
that in a sense, right?

297
00:15:50.425 --> 00:15:51.645
But it was similar to

298
00:15:51.645 --> 00:15:54.525
how we've watched God reject Saul's house

299
00:15:54.635 --> 00:15:56.245
because of his unbelief.

300
00:15:56.395 --> 00:15:57.605
He's not gonna be the king. His

301
00:15:57.605 --> 00:15:58.845
family's not gonna be the king anymore.

302
00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:00.285
God rejected his house.

303
00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:03.325
Similarly, God rejected Eli

304
00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.645
and his house from the priesthood as well.

305
00:16:08.595 --> 00:16:12.645
It's what one Samuel two verse 31 says,

306
00:16:12.865 --> 00:16:15.085
behold the days are coming when I will cut

307
00:16:15.145 --> 00:16:16.285
off your strength.

308
00:16:16.355 --> 00:16:18.365
This is to Eli, your strength

309
00:16:18.365 --> 00:16:20.405
and the strength of your father's house so

310
00:16:20.405 --> 00:16:22.965
that there will not be an old man in your house.

311
00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:26.005
Then in distress you will look

312
00:16:26.005 --> 00:16:28.565
with envious eye on all the prosperity

313
00:16:28.565 --> 00:16:30.125
that shall be bestowed on Israel.

314
00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:32.725
There shall not be an old man in your house forever.

315
00:16:33.265 --> 00:16:34.285
The only one

316
00:16:34.305 --> 00:16:38.485
of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be

317
00:16:38.545 --> 00:16:42.045
spared to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart.

318
00:16:42.505 --> 00:16:46.125
And all the descendants of your house shall die

319
00:16:46.345 --> 00:16:48.205
by the sword of men.

320
00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:54.485
Now think about it, who were the descendants of Eli?

321
00:16:57.785 --> 00:17:01.725
It was the priest, a alek and all his family.

322
00:17:03.925 --> 00:17:06.145
He was the great grandson of Eli.

323
00:17:09.075 --> 00:17:11.855
And so do you see what just happened here in chapter 22,

324
00:17:15.405 --> 00:17:19.015
Saul And do they were fully guilty

325
00:17:19.355 --> 00:17:20.375
and responsible

326
00:17:20.595 --> 00:17:23.295
for murdering the priests and their families.

327
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:28.815
Yet at the same time, God was super intending all of that

328
00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:33.975
as judgment on Eli's house fulfilling

329
00:17:34.685 --> 00:17:36.015
what he said was coming.

330
00:17:38.595 --> 00:17:40.935
And I get it. That's, that's a difficult concept.

331
00:17:41.145 --> 00:17:42.935
We'll come back to that in a moment,

332
00:17:43.555 --> 00:17:45.735
but that's, that's what we see clearly

333
00:17:45.755 --> 00:17:47.175
stated as what was happening.

334
00:17:51.065 --> 00:17:53.685
But there's one more scene in chapter 22 that we need

335
00:17:53.685 --> 00:17:56.805
to catch before we dig into that topic.

336
00:17:58.425 --> 00:18:02.645
And it was actually predicted back in chapter two in

337
00:18:02.645 --> 00:18:06.765
that scene I just read, look at one Samuel 22

338
00:18:07.665 --> 00:18:11.125
verses 20 through 23 to the end of that chapter, watch this.

339
00:18:13.165 --> 00:18:17.065
But one of the sons of a Alek, the son

340
00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:21.945
of a high tube named Abiathar, he escaped and fled

341
00:18:21.945 --> 00:18:24.625
after David and Abiathar told David

342
00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:26.945
that Saul had killed the priest of the Lord.

343
00:18:28.865 --> 00:18:31.365
And David said to Abiathar, I knew on

344
00:18:31.365 --> 00:18:33.405
that day when dog the mite was there

345
00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:35.285
that he would surely tell Saul,

346
00:18:36.965 --> 00:18:40.205
I have occasioned the death of all the persons

347
00:18:40.425 --> 00:18:41.485
of your father's house.

348
00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:46.455
Stay with me. Do not be afraid for he who seeks my life,

349
00:18:46.585 --> 00:18:48.135
seeks your life with me.

350
00:18:48.195 --> 00:18:49.815
You shall be in safekeeping.

351
00:18:52.815 --> 00:18:54.755
And so what we see here is a hero in regret.

352
00:18:57.295 --> 00:18:59.215
A hero in regret here.

353
00:19:02.855 --> 00:19:05.105
This is how we know that David was wrong

354
00:19:05.775 --> 00:19:08.425
last week when he went to the priest in the first place.

355
00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:10.945
This is how we know he shouldn't have done it

356
00:19:10.945 --> 00:19:13.545
because he is regretting it that he did it.

357
00:19:13.565 --> 00:19:15.065
He knew this was going to happen

358
00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:19.785
and so he should have just instead trusted God to provide

359
00:19:19.805 --> 00:19:21.185
for him to protect him.

360
00:19:21.365 --> 00:19:23.065
But he tried to work it out

361
00:19:23.415 --> 00:19:28.235
himself, but he didn't trust God.

362
00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:30.995
He trusted himself. He walked some roads that led

363
00:19:31.255 --> 00:19:36.125
to this do outed him.

364
00:19:37.085 --> 00:19:38.245
Hundreds of people died

365
00:19:41.695 --> 00:19:43.075
and David saw it as his fault.

366
00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:47.545
Again, it's the fulfillment of judgment on Eli's house.

367
00:19:47.565 --> 00:19:49.905
But David felt responsible.

368
00:19:50.165 --> 00:19:52.585
It wasn't the end of David's life and career.

369
00:19:52.645 --> 00:19:54.265
He knew God was with him,

370
00:19:54.685 --> 00:19:56.745
but he certainly regretted his actions.

371
00:20:01.525 --> 00:20:06.185
But notice this Abiathar, this new figure introduced here.

372
00:20:06.515 --> 00:20:07.905
Again, still looking back

373
00:20:07.905 --> 00:20:09.665
to chapter two, let's keep that in mind.

374
00:20:11.165 --> 00:20:14.345
He was the one predicted to be spared

375
00:20:16.095 --> 00:20:18.995
Who would eventually, as we walk the rest of this book,

376
00:20:19.045 --> 00:20:22.435
eventually be the one to carry on the priesthood

377
00:20:22.865 --> 00:20:23.955
through David.

378
00:20:24.495 --> 00:20:25.495
Now

379
00:20:25.935 --> 00:20:30.875
As the king Which just finalized the shift

380
00:20:30.875 --> 00:20:34.195
away from Saul, that David now has a prophet

381
00:20:34.615 --> 00:20:37.835
and a priest with him as the new key.

382
00:20:42.935 --> 00:20:45.515
Now I said this earlier,

383
00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.005
this is a pretty hard passage.

384
00:20:49.555 --> 00:20:51.085
There's a lot of pain involved.

385
00:20:53.635 --> 00:20:56.175
So many questions raised as we read through this.

386
00:20:58.705 --> 00:20:59.805
And so the question is,

387
00:20:59.805 --> 00:21:01.445
what is this passage even teaching us?

388
00:21:04.145 --> 00:21:05.955
What does this teach us? It's not just moving

389
00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:07.435
to story forward, right?

390
00:21:07.435 --> 00:21:09.315
That's what some narrative does.

391
00:21:09.335 --> 00:21:10.635
It just kind of keeps us going.

392
00:21:11.265 --> 00:21:15.395
This is more, there's more here. What is this teaching us?

393
00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:19.465
I wanna give you three truths today,

394
00:21:20.715 --> 00:21:22.105
three truths that are all separate.

395
00:21:22.105 --> 00:21:24.905
They stand on their own, but they're all interrelated.

396
00:21:26.695 --> 00:21:30.005
Watch this. Here's the first thing we learned

397
00:21:30.005 --> 00:21:31.125
from chapter 22.

398
00:21:31.145 --> 00:21:32.725
We learned that God is sovereign.

399
00:21:35.735 --> 00:21:37.555
God is sovereign.

400
00:21:39.335 --> 00:21:40.795
We don't use that word very often,

401
00:21:40.855 --> 00:21:44.315
but that word simply means he is supreme in

402
00:21:44.325 --> 00:21:45.675
power and dominion.

403
00:21:46.815 --> 00:21:49.515
He is superior to all others.

404
00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.395
He does whatever he wants

405
00:21:51.855 --> 00:21:54.435
and he is fully in control of everything.

406
00:21:56.065 --> 00:21:58.205
So when you hear the word sovereign in relation

407
00:21:58.205 --> 00:21:59.685
to God, that's what it means.

408
00:21:59.825 --> 00:22:01.005
He is in charge.

409
00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:06.855
And listen, if you just skim the surface of the Bible,

410
00:22:07.155 --> 00:22:09.735
we cannot deny the reality

411
00:22:09.955 --> 00:22:12.495
of God's sovereignty over all things.

412
00:22:12.805 --> 00:22:14.495
That he is the supreme one.

413
00:22:14.715 --> 00:22:17.655
He is God almighty, anything less than that,

414
00:22:17.685 --> 00:22:18.695
he's not God anymore.

415
00:22:22.265 --> 00:22:23.645
Yet even as I say that,

416
00:22:24.555 --> 00:22:26.245
that raises a couple questions, doesn't it?

417
00:22:28.895 --> 00:22:30.035
If we just stop and think

418
00:22:30.035 --> 00:22:32.355
and we stop to, to look around at the world,

419
00:22:32.355 --> 00:22:33.835
look at if God is sovereign,

420
00:22:33.835 --> 00:22:35.675
then then why do evil things happen?

421
00:22:38.245 --> 00:22:39.825
If he is sovereign and evil things happen?

422
00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:41.785
Well that must mean he's not good then

423
00:22:43.205 --> 00:22:46.675
it's a common question or

424
00:22:46.675 --> 00:22:49.555
or maybe this side there there's a similar related question.

425
00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:53.315
If God is sovereign, if he's in control of everything,

426
00:22:53.315 --> 00:22:54.835
then we're just robots then, right?

427
00:22:54.835 --> 00:22:56.355
Like we're just going through this thing

428
00:22:56.535 --> 00:22:57.595
as ordained and everything.

429
00:22:57.595 --> 00:22:59.795
Those are common questions we get.

430
00:23:02.055 --> 00:23:04.755
That's why the twin truth is

431
00:23:04.755 --> 00:23:07.115
that humans are responsible.

432
00:23:10.625 --> 00:23:14.565
God is sovereign and humans are responsible.

433
00:23:17.365 --> 00:23:21.265
And somehow in God's sovereignty, those

434
00:23:21.895 --> 00:23:26.735
mesh together and it's at this

435
00:23:26.735 --> 00:23:28.375
point where the really hard

436
00:23:28.435 --> 00:23:31.135
and confusing questions start to crop up, right?

437
00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:36.735
Like we try to understand in our limited minds how this,

438
00:23:36.985 --> 00:23:40.655
these twin truths actually supplement one another

439
00:23:40.675 --> 00:23:41.815
and work together.

440
00:23:41.815 --> 00:23:43.735
Because here's the tendency, we tend

441
00:23:43.735 --> 00:23:46.405
to emphasize one at the expense of the other,

442
00:23:48.425 --> 00:23:50.525
but the Bible will not allow us to do that.

443
00:23:53.395 --> 00:23:57.215
In fact, our passage today is actually pretty helpful

444
00:23:57.915 --> 00:23:59.415
to understand this better.

445
00:24:01.825 --> 00:24:05.055
See, like I said earlier, Saul

446
00:24:06.665 --> 00:24:10.085
Dogue, even David

447
00:24:10.465 --> 00:24:14.595
to a lesser extent, were all fully

448
00:24:15.225 --> 00:24:19.595
responsible and stand guilty for the murders

449
00:24:19.655 --> 00:24:20.915
of the priestly families.

450
00:24:24.005 --> 00:24:25.695
They will not be able to stand

451
00:24:25.695 --> 00:24:27.495
before the judgment seat of God

452
00:24:27.555 --> 00:24:30.095
and say, well listen, it is your sovereignty.

453
00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:34.135
They won't. They are responsible for their actions.

454
00:24:34.795 --> 00:24:37.015
Yet at the same time,

455
00:24:37.515 --> 00:24:41.455
God was utilizing their evil desires

456
00:24:41.635 --> 00:24:45.135
to bring about his bigger plan in the judgment

457
00:24:45.195 --> 00:24:46.295
of Eli's family.

458
00:24:51.015 --> 00:24:55.545
None of the people involved are innocent in their evil

459
00:24:55.965 --> 00:24:57.385
sinful decisions.

460
00:24:58.005 --> 00:25:01.585
Yet God was able to bring about his will even

461
00:25:01.615 --> 00:25:04.665
through the sinful evil decisions of those people.

462
00:25:08.985 --> 00:25:11.685
And this was not the first time that that had happened.

463
00:25:13.525 --> 00:25:17.655
This is not new when you read the Bible, think

464
00:25:17.655 --> 00:25:19.415
of young Joseph back in Genesis.

465
00:25:22.485 --> 00:25:25.865
He was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers.

466
00:25:28.055 --> 00:25:32.715
He goes through intense pain the majority of his life,

467
00:25:34.175 --> 00:25:36.275
yet God was with Joseph

468
00:25:38.275 --> 00:25:41.975
and God had a plan that involved Joseph rising

469
00:25:42.245 --> 00:25:45.855
through the Egyptian ranks to where he eventually gets to

470
00:25:45.855 --> 00:25:48.455
where he's running the whole country tree.

471
00:25:51.975 --> 00:25:56.755
And when his starving brothers come to him

472
00:25:57.295 --> 00:25:59.835
to find food from this man

473
00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:02.075
that they had no idea was their brother,

474
00:26:02.305 --> 00:26:04.675
this man they thought was dead long ago.

475
00:26:04.985 --> 00:26:09.435
They come to him. Listen to what Genesis 50 verse 20 says.

476
00:26:10.015 --> 00:26:11.715
Joseph looks at them

477
00:26:12.055 --> 00:26:14.595
and says this, as for you,

478
00:26:15.295 --> 00:26:17.635
you meant evil against me.

479
00:26:17.975 --> 00:26:22.275
But God meant it for good to bring it about

480
00:26:22.275 --> 00:26:24.875
that many people should be kept alive as they are today.

481
00:26:27.655 --> 00:26:29.395
You meant evil.

482
00:26:29.815 --> 00:26:33.115
You tried and did commit evil against me,

483
00:26:33.295 --> 00:26:36.915
but God meant all of that actually for good

484
00:26:37.175 --> 00:26:39.235
to bring about the salvation of a whole lot of people.

485
00:26:43.185 --> 00:26:46.085
See, here's what it as hard as it is for us to do.

486
00:26:46.465 --> 00:26:51.365
We must zoom out of the momentary issues and struggles

487
00:26:51.365 --> 00:26:55.205
and problems and evil in our lives and in our world.

488
00:26:55.425 --> 00:26:59.445
And we must remember that God has a plan.

489
00:27:01.775 --> 00:27:05.635
God is working his plan. It does not hear me.

490
00:27:05.735 --> 00:27:10.155
It does not exempt us from the responsibility each

491
00:27:10.155 --> 00:27:13.475
of us have for what we do in our lives, how we choose

492
00:27:13.545 --> 00:27:15.315
what we say, all of that.

493
00:27:15.495 --> 00:27:18.035
But it must all be balanced by the fact

494
00:27:18.035 --> 00:27:21.915
that God is sovereignly working out his plan.

495
00:27:25.915 --> 00:27:27.895
See, here's, here's where I think maybe we land.

496
00:27:28.135 --> 00:27:29.215
Whenever we talk about like

497
00:27:29.215 --> 00:27:31.935
and debate this a lot about humans having freedom,

498
00:27:32.315 --> 00:27:34.695
we want free will we talk about those

499
00:27:34.745 --> 00:27:35.935
kinds of things like that?

500
00:27:36.225 --> 00:27:40.455
Maybe what we're really craving is autonomy,

501
00:27:43.135 --> 00:27:45.465
that we can act fully on our own.

502
00:27:45.465 --> 00:27:46.705
That we are our own master.

503
00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:48.745
We're in charge of everything in our lives.

504
00:27:50.085 --> 00:27:51.145
Here's the problem with that.

505
00:27:52.725 --> 00:27:54.785
We can never truly be autonomous.

506
00:27:56.585 --> 00:27:58.885
We can never truly act on our own.

507
00:27:59.015 --> 00:28:02.845
We're never free from outside influences.

508
00:28:04.305 --> 00:28:05.805
We are never free from that.

509
00:28:06.665 --> 00:28:09.365
In fact, we never could be free from that.

510
00:28:09.865 --> 00:28:12.885
So our freedom has

511
00:28:12.985 --> 00:28:17.325
to operate within the sphere of something outside of us,

512
00:28:17.345 --> 00:28:21.325
within the framework of something outside of us.

513
00:28:24.255 --> 00:28:28.595
And God has purposed our freedom to operate within

514
00:28:29.255 --> 00:28:31.195
the sphere of his sovereignty,

515
00:28:32.815 --> 00:28:36.445
underneath his sovereign plan that he's working out.

516
00:28:36.585 --> 00:28:39.845
That's how our freedom operates underneath that.

517
00:28:42.355 --> 00:28:44.015
And and when you think about it, right?

518
00:28:44.915 --> 00:28:46.655
That's what's mind blowing about this

519
00:28:50.065 --> 00:28:53.605
in his sovereignty underneath his control, he's built into

520
00:28:53.605 --> 00:28:55.125
that our freedom, our choices.

521
00:28:56.645 --> 00:29:01.135
I don't understand how that works out, but he has done it.

522
00:29:01.135 --> 00:29:03.095
So what that means is we are not robots.

523
00:29:05.405 --> 00:29:06.665
We are not robots.

524
00:29:07.485 --> 00:29:11.185
But he's also not up there merely responding to

525
00:29:11.185 --> 00:29:12.825
what we are choosing in the moment.

526
00:29:13.175 --> 00:29:16.185
Like he's playing some kind of cosmic whack-a-mole game

527
00:29:16.415 --> 00:29:17.465
that he's just saying, well,

528
00:29:17.465 --> 00:29:18.825
I gotta stay ahead of him one step at a time.

529
00:29:18.825 --> 00:29:20.145
Like, and we're just choosing stuff

530
00:29:20.145 --> 00:29:21.865
and he's trying to figure out how to do it

531
00:29:22.085 --> 00:29:23.105
as we're doing it.

532
00:29:23.335 --> 00:29:25.465
That is called open theism.

533
00:29:26.365 --> 00:29:28.585
And that is horribly wrong

534
00:29:30.105 --> 00:29:32.875
because what that means is that God's not in control.

535
00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:35.435
He's merely responding to us in some final way.

536
00:29:35.655 --> 00:29:40.125
We are in control at that point. We don't want that, do we?

537
00:29:41.765 --> 00:29:43.525
I don't wanna be in control of this universe.

538
00:29:46.795 --> 00:29:50.475
I wanna serve a God that knows the future, that knows

539
00:29:51.535 --> 00:29:53.275
how we're going in this way.

540
00:29:53.275 --> 00:29:56.275
Like I, otherwise it's all chance

541
00:29:56.375 --> 00:29:58.195
and it's like based on what you do

542
00:29:58.195 --> 00:29:59.555
and I do in this boom, we,

543
00:29:59.555 --> 00:30:01.075
we have no idea where that's going.

544
00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:08.095
So since that doesn't work, we have to come back to this,

545
00:30:08.805 --> 00:30:13.415
this tr, these twin truths that are undeniable truths,

546
00:30:13.755 --> 00:30:16.935
yet unexplainable friends, that God is sovereign

547
00:30:17.235 --> 00:30:18.455
and humans are responsible.

548
00:30:21.845 --> 00:30:25.185
God is sovereign, humans are responsible.

549
00:30:25.415 --> 00:30:27.425
What that means is that we have no right

550
00:30:27.485 --> 00:30:29.545
to blame God for our sin.

551
00:30:30.485 --> 00:30:33.705
We have no right to blame God for evil in the world

552
00:30:33.925 --> 00:30:35.465
or that he's somehow not good

553
00:30:35.605 --> 00:30:37.265
or he's somehow not in control.

554
00:30:37.445 --> 00:30:40.985
We cannot do that. Instead, we need to humble ourselves.

555
00:30:41.325 --> 00:30:43.785
We need to realize that he is God.

556
00:30:44.205 --> 00:30:47.065
We are not, and that we can know there's

557
00:30:47.125 --> 00:30:49.985
so much we don't understand that we need

558
00:30:49.985 --> 00:30:52.585
to just trust him when we don't get it.

559
00:30:56.445 --> 00:30:59.535
Because there is actually a third interrelated truth here

560
00:30:59.535 --> 00:31:02.135
that we can't forget in this whole conversation,

561
00:31:02.805 --> 00:31:05.495
when we talk about evil, the question comes up about evil

562
00:31:05.595 --> 00:31:07.495
and pain and sin and all these things.

563
00:31:07.845 --> 00:31:10.215
It's common. You're thinking about it right now.

564
00:31:10.215 --> 00:31:11.695
You're trying to process it even in the moment.

565
00:31:12.075 --> 00:31:14.975
Yes, but there's a truth we cannot forget here.

566
00:31:15.195 --> 00:31:18.135
And the fact is that Christ is the

567
00:31:18.135 --> 00:31:20.715
redeemer God.

568
00:31:20.715 --> 00:31:23.035
God is sovereign, humans are responsible,

569
00:31:23.335 --> 00:31:27.705
but Christ is redeemer Because listen,

570
00:31:27.805 --> 00:31:31.065
it would be really easy for us to look around the world and

571
00:31:31.065 --> 00:31:35.265
and see the carnage supported by evil in the world or,

572
00:31:35.285 --> 00:31:37.505
or we look at how messy our lives are

573
00:31:37.645 --> 00:31:39.345
and we could get discouraged by that

574
00:31:39.365 --> 00:31:40.745
or we could get hopeless and start

575
00:31:40.745 --> 00:31:42.025
to feel hopeless about things.

576
00:31:42.045 --> 00:31:45.065
We could start to doubt God in the middle of all of this,

577
00:31:45.365 --> 00:31:48.745
but we don't have to because we have a redeemer.

578
00:31:51.785 --> 00:31:53.245
We look at one Samuel 22

579
00:31:53.385 --> 00:31:56.805
and we look at the gross sin of murder all over that.

580
00:31:56.865 --> 00:31:59.125
And we think, well, what's the answer to that?

581
00:31:59.425 --> 00:32:03.625
The answer is, Christ. We look at our own sin

582
00:32:04.165 --> 00:32:06.185
and we see how, how tempted we are

583
00:32:06.185 --> 00:32:08.665
and how nasty our history is, and we look at that

584
00:32:08.665 --> 00:32:09.705
and like, what's the answer to that?

585
00:32:09.895 --> 00:32:14.795
It's Christ. We look at the brokenness of our world.

586
00:32:15.895 --> 00:32:20.135
We, we look at war and evil and we look, we see abuse,

587
00:32:20.275 --> 00:32:22.535
and we see greed, and we see racism

588
00:32:22.835 --> 00:32:24.855
and we wonder what the answer is to all that.

589
00:32:24.995 --> 00:32:26.375
The answer is Christ.

590
00:32:28.775 --> 00:32:30.235
And I know some of you're thinking, well,

591
00:32:30.235 --> 00:32:31.635
that's just a non-answer, right?

592
00:32:31.635 --> 00:32:32.675
It's just what you say to everything.

593
00:32:32.675 --> 00:32:33.875
It's the Sunday school thing, right?

594
00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:35.875
What's, what's the answer to every question? It's Jesus.

595
00:32:36.135 --> 00:32:38.755
That's not just a simplistic,

596
00:32:39.345 --> 00:32:42.365
let me show you why Jesus is the answer.

597
00:32:42.715 --> 00:32:44.285
He's the answer for our sin.

598
00:32:45.355 --> 00:32:49.005
Because God in his eternal, check this out,

599
00:32:49.005 --> 00:32:50.645
how this ties together with all this.

600
00:32:51.385 --> 00:32:55.985
In his eternal plan of salvation, He worked

601
00:32:56.335 --> 00:32:59.745
through evil to bring about good.

602
00:33:01.705 --> 00:33:03.685
We saw with Joseph, we see it here

603
00:33:05.595 --> 00:33:07.765
because here's, here's what Acts two says.

604
00:33:09.045 --> 00:33:10.745
It clearly states that those

605
00:33:10.765 --> 00:33:14.825
who murdered Jesus were fully responsible for the sin

606
00:33:15.815 --> 00:33:17.055
That They committed.

607
00:33:19.725 --> 00:33:24.065
Yet Isaiah 53, verse 10 says, it was the will

608
00:33:24.405 --> 00:33:26.345
of the Lord to crush him.

609
00:33:28.065 --> 00:33:29.605
It was God's plan from

610
00:33:29.605 --> 00:33:33.485
before time began to have God the Son take on flesh,

611
00:33:33.485 --> 00:33:37.205
Jesus be executed, God working

612
00:33:37.835 --> 00:33:41.125
through the sinful decisions of humans

613
00:33:41.625 --> 00:33:45.205
to bring about the redemption of humans from their sin.

614
00:33:47.255 --> 00:33:51.435
You see that like God is the answer

615
00:33:51.935 --> 00:33:55.075
to sin Christ, the answer to sin.

616
00:33:55.135 --> 00:33:59.965
But that's not all. Here's how Christ is the answer

617
00:34:00.145 --> 00:34:02.285
to the evil and the brokenness in our world.

618
00:34:02.355 --> 00:34:05.285
When you look at how broken things are, the murder here,

619
00:34:05.585 --> 00:34:10.045
Christ came not only to save sinners, he also came

620
00:34:10.265 --> 00:34:14.165
to fulfill the plan of God to redeem all of creation.

621
00:34:16.595 --> 00:34:20.495
Romans eight says that creation itself is eagerly waiting,

622
00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:23.495
even groaning for redemption

623
00:34:25.345 --> 00:34:26.715
because there's coming a day,

624
00:34:27.225 --> 00:34:29.915
even creation it's baked into it knows

625
00:34:30.185 --> 00:34:32.395
that someday is coming, when

626
00:34:33.075 --> 00:34:37.435
creation will be set free from its bondage to corruption

627
00:34:37.705 --> 00:34:39.235
that things don't work right.

628
00:34:39.485 --> 00:34:40.675
It'll be set free from that

629
00:34:40.775 --> 00:34:42.835
and there'll be no more evil anywhere.

630
00:34:44.945 --> 00:34:48.835
Like we look at the carnage here of one Samuel 22,

631
00:34:49.135 --> 00:34:50.715
we look at the wickedness

632
00:34:50.935 --> 00:34:52.955
and difficulty in the world around us.

633
00:34:53.255 --> 00:34:55.475
We look at what tempts us every single day.

634
00:34:55.815 --> 00:34:58.835
The beauty is that we know the end of the story here,

635
00:35:01.785 --> 00:35:03.475
That God will judge evil,

636
00:35:04.505 --> 00:35:06.875
that God will renew creation

637
00:35:07.655 --> 00:35:11.715
and God will take his people home to a perfect eternity.

638
00:35:11.775 --> 00:35:15.145
To someday see those

639
00:35:15.225 --> 00:35:18.145
of us who've trusted in Christ for salvation,

640
00:35:18.485 --> 00:35:20.745
we will be redeemed, we'll be restored,

641
00:35:20.925 --> 00:35:22.665
and we will be safe forever.

642
00:35:23.075 --> 00:35:25.465
Where none of this stuff can even touch us anymore.

643
00:35:26.865 --> 00:35:28.185
'cause it doesn't even exist anymore.

644
00:35:31.965 --> 00:35:33.265
So what do we do while we wait for that?

645
00:35:35.185 --> 00:35:37.925
We work for justice, we work for holiness.

646
00:35:38.365 --> 00:35:41.285
Absolutely we do that. Yes, every day we should.

647
00:35:41.985 --> 00:35:45.685
But ultimately, you ought to be comforted

648
00:35:46.465 --> 00:35:51.285
by the fact that you trust a God who is sovereignly working

649
00:35:51.985 --> 00:35:55.245
all things for the good of those who love him.
