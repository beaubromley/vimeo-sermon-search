1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.155
Good evening everybody, and happy Valentine's Day to you.

2
00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.075
We were having a little technical difficulty, all my fault.

3
00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:09.235
So we're running a little behind,

4
00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:12.635
but it's actually six 15, so we're starting right on time.

5
00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:14.915
Uh, thank you all for being here.

6
00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:17.115
I was concerned about it being a holiday.

7
00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:20.315
I thought it might just be Steve and I tonight.

8
00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:22.635
And so thank you all for being here.

9
00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.475
Um, I think you should get extra credit

10
00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:28.235
for being here on Valentine's Day,

11
00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.075
but since we can't give extra credit,

12
00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:32.635
I do have a Valentine candy for you.

13
00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.435
If you didn't get a valentine today,

14
00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:38.035
I have candy down here for you.

15
00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:39.715
I was supposed to be handing it out at the back

16
00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:41.755
of the auditorium when you came in,

17
00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:43.595
but we were having technical difficulty, so

18
00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:46.315
I did not make it back there.

19
00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:49.515
But please come and get some now,

20
00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:52.955
after, during, whichever you'd like to do, uh, want

21
00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:54.155
to make that available to you.

22
00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:58.995
Uh, if was anybody not here Sunday?

23
00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:05.325
Okay, one or two, three. Okay. Uh, very good.

24
00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:07.365
Well, my name is Aaron Ferguson.

25
00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:08.645
I'm one of the elders here,

26
00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:12.125
and, uh, had the pleasure of teaching on Sunday,

27
00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:14.365
the Doctrine of Salvation.

28
00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:19.285
And tonight my goal is to just review just briefly

29
00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:23.325
the, the doctrine, the the things I taught on Sunday.

30
00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:26.445
Go into a little more depth on a couple of points

31
00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:28.325
that I couldn't on Sunday.

32
00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:33.585
Uh, I'd like to read another chapter of Ephesians.

33
00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:35.425
We focused on Ephesians two.

34
00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:37.945
I'd like to focus on Ephesians one,

35
00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:39.425
if you brought a Bible tonight.

36
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.865
And then, uh, I have asked

37
00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:48.585
myself 10 questions that are common

38
00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:52.225
salvation questions, and I'm gonna try to answer those.

39
00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:55.945
And then, Lord willing, we'll have time at the end to, uh,

40
00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:57.905
to see if you have any questions.

41
00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:01.465
So we have a lot to cover in an hour.

42
00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:05.365
I'm glad you're here, but I'm gonna do my very best

43
00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.565
to cover all of this.

44
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:10.705
Let me pray for us, and then we will, uh, we'll jump in.

45
00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:15.195
Lord, we're, uh, grateful

46
00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:17.155
to have the opportunity to be here tonight.

47
00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:22.195
Thank you for, uh, the freedom that we have to, uh,

48
00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:24.635
worship together, to study your word together,

49
00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:27.075
to pray together, to be here at church together.

50
00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:30.595
And I pray this is, uh, an encouragement, a time

51
00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:32.235
of encouragement and study.

52
00:02:33.205 --> 00:02:35.155
We're grateful that you didn't leave here.

53
00:02:35.485 --> 00:02:36.795
Leave us here alone.

54
00:02:37.695 --> 00:02:40.755
Uh, but that you left your word to guide us.

55
00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:45.755
And so tonight I just ask that you would use me to clearly

56
00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:49.595
articulate this, uh, very difficult,

57
00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:52.635
complex doctrine of salvation.

58
00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:54.675
It's in Christ and we pray. Amen.

59
00:02:57.545 --> 00:02:59.205
Well, I'm gonna do my best. Like I said,

60
00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:01.085
we have some technical difficulty, so we will

61
00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:02.925
see what happens here.

62
00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:05.445
Uh, when I push a buttons, things are supposed

63
00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:07.085
to go on the screen, so we'll see.

64
00:03:08.065 --> 00:03:11.965
Uh, so far in our series, first things first,

65
00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:13.925
we've been going through essential doctrines

66
00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:17.285
of the Christian faith, and they've

67
00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:18.525
been building on each other.

68
00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:20.605
I love this, that they've been building on each other.

69
00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:22.365
We started with God's revelation.

70
00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:27.325
How has he revealed himself? And then the attributes of God.

71
00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:32.125
Uh, the doctrine of salvation really goes back to

72
00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:35.365
what you believe about God and God's word.

73
00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:38.525
And so you've gotta have a good foundation

74
00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:39.645
of God's revelation.

75
00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:42.765
Do you believe God's word? The Bible is God's word.

76
00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:44.965
Do you believe what God says about himself?

77
00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:49.885
Do you believe about the trinity, the person of Christ?

78
00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:51.245
And then, you know, your salvation

79
00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:52.485
rests on all these things.

80
00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:56.325
So I love how these have built on each other in,

81
00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:57.365
uh, in this series.

82
00:03:57.475 --> 00:03:59.085
Looking forward to the rest of it.

83
00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:02.845
And then Sunday, I shared basically six

84
00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:04.845
salvation questions.

85
00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:08.405
And, uh, these are the, the questions that I asked.

86
00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:12.165
Uh, what is salvation? Who needs to be saved?

87
00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:16.085
Why do we need to be saved? Uh, who does the saving?

88
00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:21.285
How are we saved? And what are the benefits of being saved?

89
00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:23.565
So I'd like to just briefly, especially for those of you all

90
00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:27.605
who weren't here, uh, Sunday, to, to just go speed

91
00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:30.565
through this, uh, that what we did on Sunday.

92
00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:31.725
And then I'm gonna stop

93
00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:34.205
and go a little more slowly through a couple of points,

94
00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:36.925
add some things I couldn't on Sunday,

95
00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:39.605
and then, uh, we'll go on from there.

96
00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:42.685
So very quickly, the first question was,

97
00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:44.885
what is salvation again?

98
00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:48.165
The word salvation means to, to save or to rescue.

99
00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:51.365
And then, uh, Noah Webster defines it.

100
00:04:51.445 --> 00:04:53.685
I love Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary.

101
00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:55.725
If you don't ever use that, I

102
00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:57.965
strongly encourage you to use that.

103
00:04:58.705 --> 00:05:00.325
Uh, dictionary app.

104
00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:04.255
He said, the act of saving or preserving someone from danger

105
00:05:04.315 --> 00:05:08.535
or destruction, saving to save, to rescue.

106
00:05:08.715 --> 00:05:10.815
So this caused me to ask some more questions.

107
00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:13.855
And question number two was, who needs to be saved?

108
00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:18.375
And I pointed out in Ephesians two, three, that we all used

109
00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:21.535
to live in a way that displeased God like the rest

110
00:05:21.715 --> 00:05:24.935
of mankind, meaning we all live in a way

111
00:05:24.935 --> 00:05:28.895
that displeases God, and we all need to be saved.

112
00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.455
Salvation is for everyone.

113
00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:33.895
Uh, then we said, uh, we asked the question,

114
00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:35.135
why do we need to be saved?

115
00:05:35.915 --> 00:05:39.375
And I pointed out Paul's, uh, description

116
00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:40.615
of us before salvation.

117
00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:42.935
Without salvation, our condition is hopeless.

118
00:05:43.395 --> 00:05:48.135
We said, Ephesians two, one through three, uh,

119
00:05:48.135 --> 00:05:51.175
Paul says, we are dead in our trespasses and sins.

120
00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:53.655
We follow the prince of the power of the air.

121
00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:56.015
We follow the course of this world.

122
00:05:56.075 --> 00:05:59.845
We are sons of disobedience, and we are children of wrath.

123
00:05:59.865 --> 00:06:02.645
He was describing what we were like before salvation.

124
00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:05.685
Our condition is hopeless.

125
00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:10.565
And so why do we need to be saved? Wrap all that together.

126
00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:14.325
We are displeasing to God, our sinfulness, our,

127
00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:16.205
uh, brokenness.

128
00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:17.605
The fact that we follow

129
00:06:17.775 --> 00:06:22.245
after his enemy, Satan, uh, our condition is hopeless.

130
00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:26.685
We, we, if we aren't saved, we are forever doomed.

131
00:06:27.305 --> 00:06:30.645
And, uh, so made that as clear as I could on Sunday.

132
00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:33.085
Question number three, who does the saving?

133
00:06:33.835 --> 00:06:35.685
Pointed out Ephesians two, four.

134
00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:39.925
But God, God is the one in charge of our salvation.

135
00:06:39.935 --> 00:06:41.565
We're gonna talk more about that tonight.

136
00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:46.245
And, uh, Paul says in Ephesians two 10, we are his work,

137
00:06:46.905 --> 00:06:47.965
not ours, his work.

138
00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:53.765
And so, salvation is entirely a work of God, not anything

139
00:06:53.765 --> 00:06:55.325
that we have done.

140
00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:57.565
Why would he do that? It was the next question,

141
00:06:58.385 --> 00:06:59.805
why would God save us?

142
00:07:00.505 --> 00:07:03.285
Uh, Paul says, it's because he's rich in mercy.

143
00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:07.325
He loved us, and he is gracious towards us.

144
00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:12.005
And so, uh, the New Testament is full

145
00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:15.845
of the love of God towards mankind.

146
00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:19.125
Uh, he did it out of his love and grace

147
00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:23.565
and mercy, very fitting for us to be talking about the love

148
00:07:23.565 --> 00:07:27.045
of God and salvation on Valentine's Day, uh, tonight.

149
00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:30.965
Uh, question number five is why, or,

150
00:07:30.985 --> 00:07:32.845
or excuse me, how are we saved?

151
00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:36.205
And, uh, Paul says, in Ephesians two, eight

152
00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:39.965
and nine, we're saved by grace through faith.

153
00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:43.605
And so again, it's a, it's an act of God.

154
00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:46.205
It's the grace of God that allows us to be saved.

155
00:07:46.905 --> 00:07:49.885
But how does it happen through faith?

156
00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:55.805
And so, um, what is faith is was the question

157
00:07:55.805 --> 00:07:59.285
that we, uh, looked at last, uh, on Sunday.

158
00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:03.325
What is faith? And, um, faith is a trust.

159
00:08:03.605 --> 00:08:07.245
A trust that we put in God's gift of Jesus Christ

160
00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:08.565
for salvation.

161
00:08:09.385 --> 00:08:12.205
Uh, our works don't work.

162
00:08:12.545 --> 00:08:17.275
Uh, I explain briefly why our works don't work.

163
00:08:17.335 --> 00:08:19.195
We are fallen, broken, sinful.

164
00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:21.435
We cannot please God in any way.

165
00:08:22.015 --> 00:08:25.835
And only the, the work of Christ pleases God.

166
00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:28.755
Tonight, I want to dive a little more deeply into that.

167
00:08:29.015 --> 00:08:32.435
Why is that? Why did we have

168
00:08:32.435 --> 00:08:35.115
to be saved by Christ?

169
00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:37.155
And I've put some things on the screen here.

170
00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:40.835
Uh, he was the perfect mediator. He lived a sinless life.

171
00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:43.675
He's going to be our propitiation.

172
00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:45.595
The Bible says, I'll explain in just a minute.

173
00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:47.835
He is our atonement

174
00:08:48.335 --> 00:08:51.795
and his resurrection is going to defeat death.

175
00:08:52.335 --> 00:08:56.005
Uh, so let me dive into those just a little bit more deeply.

176
00:08:56.745 --> 00:09:01.565
Uh, Jesus is our perfect mediator. What does that mean?

177
00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:05.845
Paul says, in one Timothy two, uh, verses five

178
00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.445
and six, there's only one God,

179
00:09:07.465 --> 00:09:11.525
and there's a mediator between God and man, only one.

180
00:09:11.905 --> 00:09:14.165
And that is Christ Jesus who gave himself

181
00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:16.285
as a ransom for all.

182
00:09:18.305 --> 00:09:21.845
Why did Christ have to be the one to save us?

183
00:09:22.155 --> 00:09:23.565
He's the perfect mediator.

184
00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:28.045
A mediator is a go between two parties, two parties

185
00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:29.725
that are in conflict,

186
00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:34.965
and the mediator is the person who represents both parties.

187
00:09:35.545 --> 00:09:37.605
And to represent both God

188
00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:40.645
and man, it had to have been someone

189
00:09:40.825 --> 00:09:43.125
who was both God and man.

190
00:09:43.985 --> 00:09:46.485
So if Jesus were 100% man,

191
00:09:46.545 --> 00:09:48.845
he could not have represented us to God.

192
00:09:49.345 --> 00:09:53.165
If he was 100% God, he could not have, uh,

193
00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:56.645
he could not have sympathized with us as human beings.

194
00:09:56.645 --> 00:10:01.385
But since he is the God man, 100% in both

195
00:10:01.385 --> 00:10:03.065
of those at the same time, right?

196
00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:06.425
The hypostatic union, he, it's, he's the perfect mediator

197
00:10:06.425 --> 00:10:11.025
between it's man and God in this salvation covenant.

198
00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:14.905
And so he is, he's perfect for the job.

199
00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:18.225
Uh, God conceived him by the Holy Spirit.

200
00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:20.025
He is born of a woman. He is born human.

201
00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:23.065
We know He's, he's got human attributes,

202
00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:25.305
and yet he's he's fully God.

203
00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:29.225
And so this mediator role that he plays could only be played

204
00:10:29.325 --> 00:10:32.765
by him perfect mediator.

205
00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:35.725
Uh, the Bible says He lived a sinless life

206
00:10:35.795 --> 00:10:38.725
that was absolutely necessary for our salvation.

207
00:10:39.265 --> 00:10:41.365
He had to have lived a sinless life.

208
00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:46.285
Hebrews chapter four, Jesus was in every respect, tempted

209
00:10:46.285 --> 00:10:48.445
as we are, yet without sin.

210
00:10:49.785 --> 00:10:52.845
He was without sin. He was sinless.

211
00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:56.445
Romans by one's man, one man's obedience, Jesus,

212
00:10:57.145 --> 00:10:59.485
the many will be made righteous.

213
00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:02.605
Uh, Jesus had to have lived a sinless life. Why?

214
00:11:03.115 --> 00:11:07.405
Because God could only accept a sinless life

215
00:11:07.585 --> 00:11:10.605
as a sacrifice for the penalty of sin.

216
00:11:11.145 --> 00:11:16.005
And so Jesus had to obey the Father perfectly for God

217
00:11:16.025 --> 00:11:18.885
to accept his sacrifice on our behalf.

218
00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:22.045
So it's absolutely essential to our salvation

219
00:11:22.045 --> 00:11:24.725
that Jesus lived a sinless life.

220
00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:27.565
Very key to the doctrine of salvation.

221
00:11:28.145 --> 00:11:30.445
Uh, Jesus made atonement for our sins.

222
00:11:30.445 --> 00:11:32.085
He was the perfect sacrifice.

223
00:11:32.635 --> 00:11:35.725
Atonement meaning covering up your sin.

224
00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:38.685
Uh, atonement is all over the scriptures.

225
00:11:39.145 --> 00:11:42.165
But Jesus in, uh, Hebrews nine is described this way.

226
00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:45.445
He appeared once for all to put away sin

227
00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:47.405
by the sacrifice of himself.

228
00:11:48.015 --> 00:11:49.685
Again, perfect sacrifice.

229
00:11:49.745 --> 00:11:52.285
He had to be sinless, but he also had to die

230
00:11:53.205 --> 00:11:57.055
because death is the penalty for sin, we said on Sunday.

231
00:11:57.275 --> 00:12:01.095
So Jesus had to die. He had to make an atonement for us.

232
00:12:02.795 --> 00:12:06.455
Uh, Jesus was, and still is our propitiation.

233
00:12:06.455 --> 00:12:11.055
Now, this is a big word, uh, kind of scary theological term,

234
00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:12.255
but Paul uses it.

235
00:12:12.255 --> 00:12:13.455
So we need to know what it is.

236
00:12:15.055 --> 00:12:19.375
A person who is offended is justly,

237
00:12:20.295 --> 00:12:22.095
wrathful, angry.

238
00:12:23.245 --> 00:12:27.615
He's offended. And so there is, uh, there is wrath.

239
00:12:27.885 --> 00:12:30.975
Naturally, when you get offended, you get mad.

240
00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:36.055
The Bible says that sin, uh, angers

241
00:12:36.235 --> 00:12:40.055
or causes God in his holiness to be offended.

242
00:12:41.035 --> 00:12:42.895
And so therefore, wrath is a part

243
00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:44.535
of the penalty here for sin.

244
00:12:44.795 --> 00:12:46.815
But Jesus took away that wrath

245
00:12:46.815 --> 00:12:48.935
with his atonement, his sacrifice.

246
00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.695
And so Paul says in fir,

247
00:12:50.695 --> 00:12:54.255
or excuse me, John says, in one John in this is love, not

248
00:12:54.255 --> 00:12:56.015
that we love God, but that he loved us

249
00:12:56.675 --> 00:13:00.455
and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins.

250
00:13:00.465 --> 00:13:04.975
Jesus atonement, sinless sacrifice, which was essential

251
00:13:04.975 --> 00:13:08.455
for our salvation, also took away God's wrath.

252
00:13:08.595 --> 00:13:11.015
God is no longer wrathful.

253
00:13:11.085 --> 00:13:15.175
He's no longer offended by your sin,

254
00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:16.815
because your sin is no more.

255
00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:19.335
It's been forgiven. It's been covered up

256
00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:21.495
by the atonement of Jesus Christ.

257
00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:25.855
So Jesus is our propitiation, another piece of the

258
00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:28.855
doctrine of salvation that's very, very important.

259
00:13:30.315 --> 00:13:34.415
And then Jesus defeated death with his resurrection.

260
00:13:35.835 --> 00:13:38.735
Um, death of course, is the penalty for sin.

261
00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:42.495
Jesus died in our place, but we still die physically.

262
00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:47.695
And we, uh, are still worried about

263
00:13:47.695 --> 00:13:49.015
that curse of death.

264
00:13:49.155 --> 00:13:52.295
But Jesus being the firstborn from the dead,

265
00:13:53.095 --> 00:13:55.575
defeated the curse of death for us.

266
00:13:56.195 --> 00:13:59.175
And so Paul says, death has been swallowed up in victory.

267
00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:02.975
Death. Where is your sting?

268
00:14:03.095 --> 00:14:06.975
It no longer is something we have to be afraid of anymore,

269
00:14:06.975 --> 00:14:11.175
because in Christ is life, the sting of death is sin.

270
00:14:11.635 --> 00:14:13.735
But thanks be to God who gives us the victory

271
00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:15.655
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

272
00:14:15.715 --> 00:14:20.495
So the sting of death, that the curse of death, the penalty

273
00:14:20.675 --> 00:14:22.335
for sin has been erased.

274
00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:26.535
You and I no longer have to fear that death.

275
00:14:28.755 --> 00:14:30.885
Well, let's go on. How are we saved again?

276
00:14:30.885 --> 00:14:33.965
We're saved through faith. That is a put our trust in God.

277
00:14:34.605 --> 00:14:36.805
I use the suitcase illustration on Sunday.

278
00:14:37.665 --> 00:14:42.645
Um, we trust that God is who he says he is.

279
00:14:43.385 --> 00:14:47.765
He has done what he says he has done through his son.

280
00:14:47.865 --> 00:14:50.445
We believe that Christ has done everything we need

281
00:14:51.185 --> 00:14:54.125
to be right with God in salvation.

282
00:14:54.905 --> 00:14:57.925
So we put our faith, we put our trust in the work

283
00:14:58.145 --> 00:15:01.325
of Christ on the cross, uh,

284
00:15:01.345 --> 00:15:03.205
to pay the penalty for our sin.

285
00:15:04.465 --> 00:15:08.085
Uh, the Bible does say that we've got to believe

286
00:15:08.425 --> 00:15:10.485
or receive God's gift.

287
00:15:11.155 --> 00:15:14.805
Many times you'll see this in scripture, John one, to all

288
00:15:14.865 --> 00:15:19.485
who received Christ, who believed in his name,

289
00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:21.525
he gave the right to become children of God.

290
00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:25.605
Uh, John three 16, uh, for God so loved the world

291
00:15:25.715 --> 00:15:29.445
that he gave his only son, that whoever believe in him

292
00:15:30.115 --> 00:15:34.165
believe and receive as part of that, putting your faith in

293
00:15:34.755 --> 00:15:37.525
what God has done for us through Christ.

294
00:15:37.865 --> 00:15:40.685
So it's our response to, uh, his

295
00:15:41.205 --> 00:15:42.965
merciful gift of salvation.

296
00:15:44.685 --> 00:15:48.545
Uh, the last question I answered on Sunday,

297
00:15:48.605 --> 00:15:50.225
and then we'll go on to some new things.

298
00:15:51.175 --> 00:15:54.185
What are the benefits of being saved?

299
00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:59.425
And, uh, I mentioned Sunday that the benefits are endless.

300
00:15:59.485 --> 00:16:01.425
We could spend a year talking about the

301
00:16:01.785 --> 00:16:02.825
benefits of salvation.

302
00:16:02.885 --> 00:16:05.465
So I mentioned three in the verse,

303
00:16:06.245 --> 00:16:09.745
but, uh, if you have your Bibles in Ephesians, chapter one,

304
00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:13.985
we, we read Ephesians two last week or last Sunday.

305
00:16:14.525 --> 00:16:17.625
Uh, but we didn't focus on Ephesians one.

306
00:16:17.645 --> 00:16:19.545
If you have a, your device

307
00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.065
or your Bible, Ephesians one,

308
00:16:23.435 --> 00:16:24.855
uh, is phenomenal.

309
00:16:25.435 --> 00:16:28.015
And Paul describes a lot of the benefits

310
00:16:28.035 --> 00:16:30.095
of salvation in Ephesians one.

311
00:16:30.475 --> 00:16:32.855
Now I have Ephesians one, three on the screen,

312
00:16:32.995 --> 00:16:35.575
but, uh, we will read some other parts

313
00:16:35.575 --> 00:16:37.175
of Ephesians one here in just a minute.

314
00:16:37.175 --> 00:16:38.375
Blessed be the God

315
00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:40.175
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

316
00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:44.495
who has blessed us in Christ with every

317
00:16:45.575 --> 00:16:46.695
spiritual blessing.

318
00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:50.015
Another way to say that is who has blessed us with

319
00:16:50.715 --> 00:16:54.015
all the benefits that come with salvation.

320
00:16:54.115 --> 00:16:58.735
And the list is very, very long of the spiritual benefits,

321
00:16:58.735 --> 00:17:03.255
the blessings that Christ has, uh, earned

322
00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:04.455
for us at the cross.

323
00:17:04.595 --> 00:17:07.855
So I mentioned three on Sunday. I wanna mention some others.

324
00:17:08.015 --> 00:17:09.015
I didn't have time to.

325
00:17:09.585 --> 00:17:11.735
Again, we could spend a year of,

326
00:17:11.955 --> 00:17:14.975
of Wednesday nights going over every one of these benefits.

327
00:17:15.755 --> 00:17:20.295
But, um, ke keep reading here with me in Ephesians chapter

328
00:17:20.835 --> 00:17:22.975
one, and then I'll come back to these, uh,

329
00:17:24.595 --> 00:17:25.615
to these benefits.

330
00:17:26.515 --> 00:17:30.975
Uh, verse four, just as he chose us in him

331
00:17:30.995 --> 00:17:32.655
before the foundation of the world,

332
00:17:33.105 --> 00:17:36.135
we're gonna talk about his choosing here in just a minute.

333
00:17:37.215 --> 00:17:40.345
That we would be holy and blameless before him.

334
00:17:40.355 --> 00:17:43.075
There are some benefits in love.

335
00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:46.235
He predestined us to adoption. There's another benefit.

336
00:17:46.835 --> 00:17:50.195
Adoption has sons through Jesus Christ

337
00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:53.675
to himself according to the kind intention of his will,

338
00:17:54.455 --> 00:17:56.395
to the praise of the glory of His grace,

339
00:17:56.405 --> 00:18:00.435
which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved in Him,

340
00:18:00.495 --> 00:18:03.235
we have redemption, another benefit, redemption

341
00:18:03.905 --> 00:18:07.795
through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses,

342
00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:11.345
forgiveness, another benefit according to the riches

343
00:18:11.345 --> 00:18:14.345
of his grace, which he lavished on us in all wisdom

344
00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:18.505
and insight he made known to us the mystery of his will,

345
00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:22.145
according to his kind intention, which he purposed in him

346
00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:25.245
with a view to the administration, suitable

347
00:18:25.265 --> 00:18:26.805
to the fullness of the times.

348
00:18:27.395 --> 00:18:29.765
That is the summing up of all things in Christ,

349
00:18:29.765 --> 00:18:32.125
things in heaven, things on the earth.

350
00:18:32.225 --> 00:18:35.325
And in Him, we have obtained an inheritance.

351
00:18:35.425 --> 00:18:39.105
We are heirs as adopted sons.

352
00:18:39.105 --> 00:18:43.185
We have an inheritance is another benefit that we have,

353
00:18:43.185 --> 00:18:45.665
having been predestined according to his purpose,

354
00:18:45.805 --> 00:18:46.905
who works all things

355
00:18:47.555 --> 00:18:50.505
after the counsel of his will to the end.

356
00:18:50.815 --> 00:18:54.545
That we who are first a hope in Christ would be

357
00:18:54.645 --> 00:18:56.025
to the praise of His glory.

358
00:18:56.085 --> 00:18:57.225
And in Him also,

359
00:18:57.755 --> 00:19:00.185
after listening to the message of truth, the gospel

360
00:19:00.245 --> 00:19:04.625
of your salvation, having also believed you were sealed

361
00:19:05.285 --> 00:19:07.665
in Him with the Holy Spirit sealed.

362
00:19:08.165 --> 00:19:11.665
You are sealed by the Holy Spirit. We will talk about that.

363
00:19:12.455 --> 00:19:16.945
Another benefit who is given as a pledge of our inheritance.

364
00:19:17.095 --> 00:19:18.185
He's promised to you.

365
00:19:18.645 --> 00:19:22.945
And the Holy Spirit is keeping you, uh,

366
00:19:23.555 --> 00:19:27.345
until you can inherit what God has for you to inherit

367
00:19:27.695 --> 00:19:30.465
with a view to the redemption of God's own possession,

368
00:19:30.885 --> 00:19:32.945
to the praise of His glory.

369
00:19:34.405 --> 00:19:36.795
Again, we could spend a long time on

370
00:19:36.795 --> 00:19:38.195
the benefits of salvation.

371
00:19:38.195 --> 00:19:42.555
But Jim, just to mention a few generation regeneration,

372
00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:46.875
uh, Jesus says that when you are saved,

373
00:19:47.095 --> 00:19:48.675
you are born again.

374
00:19:48.775 --> 00:19:52.715
You are given a new nature, a new spirit.

375
00:19:52.815 --> 00:19:54.875
The holy spirit's gonna come and live in you,

376
00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:56.515
and you are regenerated.

377
00:19:57.105 --> 00:19:58.995
It's like you've been born again.

378
00:19:59.655 --> 00:20:01.995
And you remember his conversation with Nicodemus.

379
00:20:01.995 --> 00:20:04.195
Nicodemus couldn't quite get his mind around that.

380
00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:07.475
But that's regeneration. It's another benefit.

381
00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:11.195
We we're not dead in our sins and trespasses anymore.

382
00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:14.355
We have new life. Talked a little bit about that on Sunday.

383
00:20:15.025 --> 00:20:18.315
Justification is another one that Paul talks a lot about.

384
00:20:18.865 --> 00:20:21.955
Because of the forgiveness that we have in Christ,

385
00:20:23.415 --> 00:20:26.115
God now sees us not as sinners,

386
00:20:26.295 --> 00:20:28.555
but as sinless.

387
00:20:30.235 --> 00:20:32.275
Remember the great exchange between Christ

388
00:20:32.295 --> 00:20:36.315
and us, God made him who knew no sin, his Son

389
00:20:37.335 --> 00:20:39.795
to become sin for us so

390
00:20:39.795 --> 00:20:43.755
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

391
00:20:43.975 --> 00:20:47.805
The big exchange right there, our sinfulness was replaced

392
00:20:47.835 --> 00:20:49.685
with his righteousness.

393
00:20:49.705 --> 00:20:52.645
So when God sees us now, he sees us

394
00:20:52.745 --> 00:20:55.085
as righteous, sinless.

395
00:20:56.105 --> 00:20:58.765
Not that you don't sin in the flesh,

396
00:20:59.015 --> 00:21:00.685
we'll talk about sanctification, but,

397
00:21:01.225 --> 00:21:05.285
but he now sees you through the lens of Christ

398
00:21:05.705 --> 00:21:10.005
and you are justified, meaning, uh, he sees you just

399
00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:12.205
as if you have not sinned.

400
00:21:12.795 --> 00:21:17.045
Justification. It's a, it's a wonderful, uh, benefit

401
00:21:17.305 --> 00:21:19.085
of salvation, reconciliation.

402
00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.685
You know what that is? We have been,

403
00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:25.525
our sin has separated us from the fellowship of God.

404
00:21:25.545 --> 00:21:29.845
And now Christ has reconciled that, that relationship,

405
00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:31.885
and we now have fellowship with him again.

406
00:21:32.415 --> 00:21:35.165
Redemption. We've been bought with a price.

407
00:21:35.535 --> 00:21:39.125
We've been, Jesus gave himself as a ransom for us.

408
00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:41.285
We've been redeemed.

409
00:21:41.545 --> 00:21:44.525
We, we've been bought back from the enemy, right?

410
00:21:45.105 --> 00:21:48.725
Uh, Jesus paid for us with his life on the cross.

411
00:21:48.815 --> 00:21:51.485
We've been, we've been redeemed.

412
00:21:51.535 --> 00:21:53.925
Redemption is another, uh, benefit.

413
00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:58.805
We now belong to the Savior, not to, uh, to Satan.

414
00:21:58.865 --> 00:22:01.805
As we were talking about Sunday adoption.

415
00:22:03.025 --> 00:22:04.605
He adopts us as one of his children.

416
00:22:06.105 --> 00:22:10.565
Uh, the Bible calls us, adopted, uh, sons

417
00:22:10.565 --> 00:22:12.005
of God, children of God.

418
00:22:12.585 --> 00:22:17.525
Uh, people who are, uh, sons of God have inheritances.

419
00:22:17.525 --> 00:22:21.445
They are heirs. And so we will inherit everything

420
00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:25.845
that God has ready for us to inherit, uh, someday when we,

421
00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:27.925
uh, go to be with him.

422
00:22:28.385 --> 00:22:29.605
The Holy Spirit is a benefit.

423
00:22:29.865 --> 00:22:33.645
You know, the Holy Spirit indwells those who are believers,

424
00:22:33.745 --> 00:22:37.885
he, uh, left us, went back to heaven,

425
00:22:37.945 --> 00:22:41.005
but he sent the helper to indwell us

426
00:22:41.265 --> 00:22:43.285
and enable us to

427
00:22:43.835 --> 00:22:46.565
live the Christian life the way we should equip us

428
00:22:46.955 --> 00:22:49.045
with spiritual gifts and other things lead us

429
00:22:49.045 --> 00:22:51.085
to truth sanctification.

430
00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:52.765
One of the benefits is

431
00:22:52.765 --> 00:22:55.805
that he is now conforming us into the image

432
00:22:55.805 --> 00:22:59.365
of his son sanctifying us.

433
00:23:00.385 --> 00:23:04.685
He is moving us in a direction where we are starting

434
00:23:04.745 --> 00:23:09.165
to look like and reflect the image of his son.

435
00:23:09.185 --> 00:23:12.725
Now, that doesn't happen perfectly while we're here,

436
00:23:13.545 --> 00:23:18.205
but we will someday be just like him, sinless.

437
00:23:19.105 --> 00:23:22.845
And, um, that's what the end game of sanctification,

438
00:23:22.845 --> 00:23:24.605
which we call glorification.

439
00:23:25.505 --> 00:23:27.045
So you're growing spiritually.

440
00:23:27.045 --> 00:23:30.165
You're becoming more and more like Christ and your attitudes

441
00:23:30.165 --> 00:23:32.845
and your character qualities

442
00:23:32.985 --> 00:23:35.405
and the, you know, the fruits of the spirit are coming out.

443
00:23:35.405 --> 00:23:37.205
And you, you have a desire

444
00:23:37.345 --> 00:23:39.605
to share his good news with other people.

445
00:23:40.065 --> 00:23:44.685
You're being sanctified, made holy in the flesh just

446
00:23:44.685 --> 00:23:45.925
as you are internally.

447
00:23:46.545 --> 00:23:48.645
You are now becoming externally.

448
00:23:49.105 --> 00:23:51.445
And then one day that sanctification,

449
00:23:51.505 --> 00:23:54.605
what's the final chapter is called Glorification.

450
00:23:54.675 --> 00:23:56.045
When sin is No more.

451
00:23:56.625 --> 00:23:59.085
And we are, we take on that glorified body

452
00:23:59.465 --> 00:24:02.085
and we look just like Christ.

453
00:24:02.785 --> 00:24:06.925
And so anyway, these are some of the benefits of salvation.

454
00:24:07.665 --> 00:24:10.605
And, uh, golly, we could talk about a lot more.

455
00:24:10.785 --> 00:24:13.165
But, uh, I wanted to hit on just a few.

456
00:24:15.035 --> 00:24:18.245
Well, let's go on. I have, I was trying to think

457
00:24:18.245 --> 00:24:21.165
of some questions that, um,

458
00:24:21.515 --> 00:24:24.845
regularly come up in conversations about salvation.

459
00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:29.965
And, uh, I wanted to pose these questions

460
00:24:29.965 --> 00:24:31.725
and give you an answer here.

461
00:24:32.345 --> 00:24:35.325
And then, uh, Lord willing, will have time for you

462
00:24:35.325 --> 00:24:36.325
to ask questions as well.

463
00:24:36.945 --> 00:24:41.725
Pardon my voice. I, uh, five times today.

464
00:24:41.785 --> 00:24:44.125
So this is my sixth time to teach,

465
00:24:44.185 --> 00:24:46.285
and I'm hoping it'll last a little bit longer.

466
00:24:49.125 --> 00:24:52.465
Um, alright. And we start talking about salvation.

467
00:24:52.535 --> 00:24:55.705
What about election? What about predestination?

468
00:24:56.325 --> 00:24:57.985
Uh, if you're still there in Ephesians one,

469
00:24:58.935 --> 00:25:03.795
look back at verse four, Ephesians one

470
00:25:03.795 --> 00:25:05.435
and verse four, what about election?

471
00:25:07.315 --> 00:25:09.535
Uh, what about this thing called predestination?

472
00:25:10.005 --> 00:25:11.535
What is election in the first place?

473
00:25:12.155 --> 00:25:16.905
Uh, election is this idea that God, uh,

474
00:25:16.925 --> 00:25:20.145
before the creation of the world, chose those

475
00:25:21.125 --> 00:25:22.465
who would be saved.

476
00:25:23.325 --> 00:25:25.825
And, um, if you look at Ephesians one

477
00:25:25.825 --> 00:25:28.065
and verse four, just as he

478
00:25:28.635 --> 00:25:30.865
chose us in him, thank you so much.

479
00:25:31.095 --> 00:25:35.085
It's kind of you. Just as he, uh, chose us in him

480
00:25:35.085 --> 00:25:38.605
before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy

481
00:25:38.665 --> 00:25:42.365
and blameless before him in love,

482
00:25:42.665 --> 00:25:45.605
he predestined us to adoption.

483
00:25:46.315 --> 00:25:50.225
Okay? Do we believe in election and predestination?

484
00:25:50.325 --> 00:25:52.145
We have to. It's right there in scripture.

485
00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:54.265
And so of course we do.

486
00:25:57.685 --> 00:26:01.625
How do we reconcile this though, with

487
00:26:01.625 --> 00:26:03.025
what we know about salvation?

488
00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:06.705
Skip on down to verse, uh, 11. I forgot to read that one.

489
00:26:07.615 --> 00:26:10.745
Also, we have obtained an inheritance having been

490
00:26:11.455 --> 00:26:13.305
predestined according to his purpose.

491
00:26:13.955 --> 00:26:17.585
Again, predestined. Uh, this is all over the New Testament.

492
00:26:18.765 --> 00:26:19.945
You can't get around.

493
00:26:19.975 --> 00:26:21.625
It's not like as a Christian, you can say,

494
00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:24.625
I don't believe in election or predestination.

495
00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:28.145
Well, it's in scripture. It's a biblical concept.

496
00:26:28.535 --> 00:26:30.505
It's, it's a doctrine itself.

497
00:26:30.565 --> 00:26:32.425
And so, uh, we have to wrestle

498
00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:34.425
with election and predestination.

499
00:26:35.475 --> 00:26:37.815
Uh, here's the, here's the thought

500
00:26:37.955 --> 00:26:41.015
behind election in our sin.

501
00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:45.765
We were dead in our trespasses and sins.

502
00:26:46.395 --> 00:26:50.565
Paul says, Romans chapter three, that no one seeks God.

503
00:26:50.945 --> 00:26:55.925
No one understands, no one is righteous. None.

504
00:26:57.425 --> 00:26:59.725
If that's true, which we believe it is, all

505
00:26:59.725 --> 00:27:01.925
of us are rotten from the beginning.

506
00:27:03.105 --> 00:27:04.565
No one seeks God.

507
00:27:04.785 --> 00:27:07.325
So no one would ever get saved

508
00:27:09.885 --> 00:27:13.425
except God has elected some

509
00:27:13.605 --> 00:27:14.905
to be saved.

510
00:27:15.005 --> 00:27:18.545
He has chosen before time, uh,

511
00:27:19.045 --> 00:27:20.185
for some to be saved.

512
00:27:20.245 --> 00:27:23.895
He has predestined some to be saved.

513
00:27:23.895 --> 00:27:27.215
Listen to these, uh, verses Acts chapter 13,

514
00:27:27.245 --> 00:27:29.135
when the Gentiles heard the gospel,

515
00:27:30.235 --> 00:27:34.415
as many had been appointed to eternal life, believed

516
00:27:36.065 --> 00:27:39.455
Jesus regularly said when he was teaching those

517
00:27:39.515 --> 00:27:44.415
who have an ear here, right?

518
00:27:45.225 --> 00:27:47.175
Those who have an ear pay attention.

519
00:27:47.875 --> 00:27:50.415
Uh, he would, he would teach to a crowd.

520
00:27:51.515 --> 00:27:55.295
But those who have an ear would respond to him.

521
00:27:55.475 --> 00:27:59.535
Not everybody would respond to the gospel, but some would.

522
00:28:00.635 --> 00:28:02.935
Why would those some respond?

523
00:28:03.445 --> 00:28:05.135
Because they had been appointed

524
00:28:05.995 --> 00:28:09.815
before time, not based on any merit of our own, but just

525
00:28:09.815 --> 00:28:11.615
because of God's sovereign choice.

526
00:28:12.805 --> 00:28:16.855
Some would believe Second Thessalonians, we are bound

527
00:28:16.855 --> 00:28:18.255
to give thanks to God for you

528
00:28:18.845 --> 00:28:23.655
because God chose you from the beginning to be saved.

529
00:28:23.805 --> 00:28:25.375
It's all over the New Testament.

530
00:28:25.795 --> 00:28:27.895
So we have to wrestle with this in our minds.

531
00:28:27.895 --> 00:28:30.815
What does that mean? It means what? It says.

532
00:28:31.355 --> 00:28:34.535
God chose before time, some to be saved,

533
00:28:34.565 --> 00:28:38.015
otherwise no one would be saved.

534
00:28:38.015 --> 00:28:41.775
Because no one's gonna choose God out of a rebellious,

535
00:28:42.315 --> 00:28:43.415
sinful, dead heart

536
00:28:44.515 --> 00:28:48.865
unless he wakes them up, right,

537
00:28:49.465 --> 00:28:51.825
regenerates them, and they come to him

538
00:28:51.825 --> 00:28:53.345
because he has chosen them.

539
00:28:54.405 --> 00:28:56.985
So it's a, it's hard to wrap our minds around,

540
00:28:57.485 --> 00:28:59.265
but we have to wrestle with it

541
00:28:59.265 --> 00:29:01.625
because it's right here in Scripture.

542
00:29:03.285 --> 00:29:06.585
Uh, probably the most, well-known passage of this

543
00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:09.745
doctrine is Romans 8 29

544
00:29:09.765 --> 00:29:14.345
and 30 for those whom he God four new.

545
00:29:15.365 --> 00:29:17.905
He also predestined to become conformed

546
00:29:17.905 --> 00:29:18.985
to the image of his son.

547
00:29:19.485 --> 00:29:23.025
Before time he knew some would be saved.

548
00:29:24.285 --> 00:29:27.865
He chose some to be saved. For knew here means he acted.

549
00:29:28.695 --> 00:29:30.545
It's not just he knew who would pick him,

550
00:29:30.605 --> 00:29:33.225
but he actively knew them.

551
00:29:33.325 --> 00:29:36.545
He chose them. He predestined them to be conformed

552
00:29:36.545 --> 00:29:38.745
to his image, the image of his son.

553
00:29:39.285 --> 00:29:43.005
And then those that he chose, who he predestined,

554
00:29:43.005 --> 00:29:45.285
the Bible says, he calls he

555
00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:48.215
who has an ear here, right?

556
00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:51.375
Uh, he calls them and they respond.

557
00:29:51.395 --> 00:29:53.335
And this is whom he called. He justified.

558
00:29:53.475 --> 00:29:57.695
He forgave, he cleansed them as wide as snow.

559
00:29:58.315 --> 00:30:01.095
And these whom he justified, he glorifies.

560
00:30:01.205 --> 00:30:03.975
They, they will become like his son.

561
00:30:04.545 --> 00:30:09.495
Eventually, uh, after, uh, they begin eternal life.

562
00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:12.575
So, okay, this is all over the New Testament.

563
00:30:13.035 --> 00:30:14.255
Uh, just wanna point it out.

564
00:30:14.975 --> 00:30:19.385
Election as Christians, as people who believe the Bible

565
00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:23.625
election is, has got to be one of those doctrines

566
00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:27.265
that we're aware of and believe in because it's biblical

567
00:30:28.365 --> 00:30:31.105
and, uh, doesn't make it easy to understand for sure.

568
00:30:31.605 --> 00:30:34.385
But it's there. We have to, uh, we have to grapple with it.

569
00:30:36.515 --> 00:30:38.375
So, okay, here's a common question.

570
00:30:38.435 --> 00:30:41.215
Why would I share the gospel if God has already

571
00:30:41.215 --> 00:30:42.415
chosen who will be saved?

572
00:30:42.955 --> 00:30:44.575
And I apologize for the, uh,

573
00:30:44.595 --> 00:30:46.695
the text running off the screen there.

574
00:30:47.435 --> 00:30:49.735
We had some technical difficulty, as I was saying,

575
00:30:51.195 --> 00:30:52.935
why do you share the gospel if God's already

576
00:30:52.935 --> 00:30:54.255
chosen some people to be saved?

577
00:30:55.465 --> 00:30:58.115
Well, number one, Jesus told us to share the gospel,

578
00:30:58.895 --> 00:31:01.395
go into all the nations and make disciples.

579
00:31:02.135 --> 00:31:05.355
So we're commanded to share the gospel.

580
00:31:06.185 --> 00:31:08.035
Okay, well, that makes that pretty simple.

581
00:31:08.735 --> 00:31:11.395
And you and I don't know who the chosen are.

582
00:31:13.175 --> 00:31:18.075
So we fish for men, we cast our nets,

583
00:31:18.975 --> 00:31:20.395
we throw out our line.

584
00:31:20.495 --> 00:31:23.635
We don't know who the chosen are. Only God knows that.

585
00:31:24.455 --> 00:31:28.515
And so you and I obey God and we cast our nets

586
00:31:28.535 --> 00:31:31.315
or throw our line in and we fish for men

587
00:31:31.335 --> 00:31:32.395
and the way we're supposed to,

588
00:31:33.175 --> 00:31:37.515
and some will receive the good news and some won't.

589
00:31:37.935 --> 00:31:39.075
We know that to be true,

590
00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:42.675
but we want to be obedient to what the gospel says.

591
00:31:43.375 --> 00:31:47.035
Uh, God wants to use us to reach the chosen.

592
00:31:47.935 --> 00:31:51.835
How will they believe if they have not heard right?

593
00:31:51.895 --> 00:31:54.475
And how will they hear unless somebody goes to them?

594
00:31:55.215 --> 00:31:57.675
He wants to use us as a part of his work

595
00:31:57.815 --> 00:31:59.635
to share the gospel.

596
00:31:59.895 --> 00:32:03.275
And so there are biblical reasons

597
00:32:03.455 --> 00:32:04.835
for why we share the gospel.

598
00:32:05.895 --> 00:32:08.835
Um, does, do we get frustrated when some don't believe?

599
00:32:09.605 --> 00:32:12.475
Maybe, but we probably shouldn't.

600
00:32:13.175 --> 00:32:15.795
We know some will believe and some won't.

601
00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:19.875
Our job is not to, to grab the fish

602
00:32:19.895 --> 00:32:21.155
and pull them into the boat.

603
00:32:22.175 --> 00:32:25.395
Our job is just to throw out the net or to cast our line.

604
00:32:25.775 --> 00:32:28.435
And those whom God has chosen will respond.

605
00:32:28.535 --> 00:32:31.915
So, uh, this really frees us up, share the gospel,

606
00:32:32.175 --> 00:32:34.315
but leave the results up to God.

607
00:32:34.575 --> 00:32:37.435
We, we don't control people's salvation.

608
00:32:37.775 --> 00:32:42.765
Uh, we leave the, the, uh, the catching of the fish to him.

609
00:32:44.085 --> 00:32:46.025
So yes, we should share the gospel.

610
00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:50.625
Uh, even though God has elected some,

611
00:32:51.565 --> 00:32:53.985
uh, if God has elected or chosen

612
00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:57.505
or predestined, whatever word you want to use, doesn't

613
00:32:57.745 --> 00:32:59.505
that override our free will?

614
00:32:59.615 --> 00:33:00.785
What about our free will?

615
00:33:00.845 --> 00:33:04.995
You always hear about our free will? Well, it is true.

616
00:33:05.135 --> 00:33:06.995
God created us with freedom of choice.

617
00:33:07.775 --> 00:33:09.635
You chose to came, come here tonight.

618
00:33:09.635 --> 00:33:10.875
You chose what you ate today.

619
00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:12.555
You chose how, what you put on,

620
00:33:12.555 --> 00:33:13.995
what you chose what to do in your day.

621
00:33:15.015 --> 00:33:16.675
You make choices and there are

622
00:33:16.675 --> 00:33:17.875
consequences for your choices.

623
00:33:19.095 --> 00:33:22.835
But your will is in bondage

624
00:33:23.175 --> 00:33:24.315
before salvation.

625
00:33:25.385 --> 00:33:30.275
Your will is remember, uh, an expression

626
00:33:30.275 --> 00:33:32.845
of your sinful,

627
00:33:34.275 --> 00:33:36.485
imperfect, broken nature.

628
00:33:37.345 --> 00:33:38.685
And so your will,

629
00:33:38.905 --> 00:33:41.005
you might think you have a completely free

630
00:33:41.005 --> 00:33:42.205
will, but you really don't.

631
00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:46.645
It's tainted and spoiled by your sinfulness.

632
00:33:47.505 --> 00:33:50.125
And so your will is really not free at all.

633
00:33:51.265 --> 00:33:54.805
Uh, and if God let you have your way,

634
00:33:54.985 --> 00:33:56.485
you would never choose him.

635
00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:59.445
Right? We, we've already talked about that.

636
00:34:00.105 --> 00:34:02.925
So your will is bound by your sinful nature.

637
00:34:03.145 --> 00:34:06.405
And, and then therefore, we would never choose to be saved.

638
00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:10.405
Um, so again, he has to elect some

639
00:34:11.385 --> 00:34:15.155
because no one would choose Jesus

640
00:34:15.785 --> 00:34:17.835
that we all rebel against him.

641
00:34:17.975 --> 00:34:19.795
So what about your free will?

642
00:34:19.905 --> 00:34:23.155
Well before salvation, your will is not free anyway,

643
00:34:23.685 --> 00:34:24.835
completely free.

644
00:34:25.495 --> 00:34:28.315
You're bound by your sinful nature.

645
00:34:28.815 --> 00:34:32.595
And it's God who raises you from the dead

646
00:34:32.695 --> 00:34:34.995
and takes you out of the darkness and,

647
00:34:35.455 --> 00:34:38.115
and regenerates your heart and gives you the faith.

648
00:34:38.265 --> 00:34:41.155
It's remember, salvation is a work of God, not yours.

649
00:34:41.775 --> 00:34:44.955
His, if he didn't do it, you wouldn't be saved.

650
00:34:46.265 --> 00:34:48.445
So free will. A lot of people want to throw that out there.

651
00:34:48.545 --> 00:34:50.525
But, um,

652
00:34:51.815 --> 00:34:53.935
I think the Bible has a pretty good answer for that.

653
00:34:55.645 --> 00:34:56.895
Will all people be saved?

654
00:34:56.895 --> 00:34:59.975
Here's another question that, that we get a lot.

655
00:35:00.235 --> 00:35:04.255
Uh, first Timothy two, God desires all men to be saved

656
00:35:05.275 --> 00:35:06.975
and come to the knowledge of the truth.

657
00:35:06.975 --> 00:35:10.095
Does that mean all men will be saved? Two Peter three?

658
00:35:10.395 --> 00:35:13.295
God does not wish that any should perish,

659
00:35:13.875 --> 00:35:15.975
but that all should repent.

660
00:35:16.395 --> 00:35:20.735
It sure seems like God, uh, is gonna save all people.

661
00:35:21.635 --> 00:35:23.255
You and I know of course that's not true.

662
00:35:23.355 --> 00:35:24.975
But you look at scripture like that

663
00:35:25.755 --> 00:35:29.135
and you, you think, well, that's inconsistent,

664
00:35:29.195 --> 00:35:33.255
or that contradicts what other scriptures say.

665
00:35:33.835 --> 00:35:35.455
And you have to be really careful here.

666
00:35:36.595 --> 00:35:40.185
Uh, never make a doctrine based on one verse.

667
00:35:41.155 --> 00:35:42.495
That's a really bad idea.

668
00:35:43.235 --> 00:35:47.575
Always take a verse in its context, very close context,

669
00:35:47.785 --> 00:35:51.415
other verses First maybe a chapter, maybe the book

670
00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:55.095
that it's in, uh, maybe the topic that's being discussed.

671
00:35:55.245 --> 00:35:57.855
Take all those things into consideration when you read a

672
00:35:57.855 --> 00:35:59.455
verse like these.

673
00:36:00.475 --> 00:36:03.335
And then maybe even the bigger picture of the New Testament

674
00:36:03.355 --> 00:36:05.175
or the, the Bible as a whole.

675
00:36:05.955 --> 00:36:08.855
So, uh, God desires all men to be saved.

676
00:36:09.445 --> 00:36:11.935
What does the word all mean in this verse? Right?

677
00:36:11.955 --> 00:36:13.655
You have to look at the rest

678
00:36:13.675 --> 00:36:15.855
of the passage verses one through four.

679
00:36:16.675 --> 00:36:21.255
Um, Paul is telling the people here in Ephesus to be praying

680
00:36:21.435 --> 00:36:24.615
for all people, even those in authority,

681
00:36:25.625 --> 00:36:26.655
kings and rulers.

682
00:36:26.885 --> 00:36:30.615
Because God desires all people to be saved.

683
00:36:30.755 --> 00:36:34.175
In other words, all kinds of people to be saved.

684
00:36:34.235 --> 00:36:38.695
We know God did not choose everyone to be saved, right?

685
00:36:39.075 --> 00:36:43.575
Um, only, uh, eight people on the arc,

686
00:36:43.995 --> 00:36:46.615
but everybody else was destroyed, right?

687
00:36:47.475 --> 00:36:50.575
Uh, only four people in, so, you know, Gamora,

688
00:36:51.705 --> 00:36:53.415
Sodom, uh, were saved.

689
00:36:53.415 --> 00:36:54.615
Everybody else was lost.

690
00:36:55.155 --> 00:36:57.455
So not everybody is saved, we know that.

691
00:36:58.035 --> 00:37:00.255
But sometimes when you read these verses you

692
00:37:00.255 --> 00:37:01.495
think, well, wait a minute.

693
00:37:01.565 --> 00:37:04.735
Does God save everybody? No, he does not save everybody.

694
00:37:05.315 --> 00:37:06.975
You have to keep this into context.

695
00:37:07.075 --> 00:37:09.495
So this is not universalism. Everybody is saved.

696
00:37:10.435 --> 00:37:13.055
You see that today, uh, a lot

697
00:37:13.055 --> 00:37:17.895
of universalist churches out there that are, you know,

698
00:37:17.895 --> 00:37:21.175
they preach that everybody gets saved no matter who you are

699
00:37:21.175 --> 00:37:23.535
or where you are, everybody goes to heaven.

700
00:37:24.035 --> 00:37:27.535
And that is not, uh, I don't think biblical at all.

701
00:37:28.275 --> 00:37:30.975
Um, you can't use this verse to support that.

702
00:37:31.035 --> 00:37:33.895
The other verse we were talking about, two Peter three,

703
00:37:33.895 --> 00:37:36.095
nine, will all people be saved?

704
00:37:36.195 --> 00:37:38.055
God does not wish that any should perish,

705
00:37:38.075 --> 00:37:39.575
but that all should repent.

706
00:37:40.405 --> 00:37:42.415
He's talking here again, you gotta look at the context

707
00:37:42.555 --> 00:37:45.135
of the bigger passage verses three through nine.

708
00:37:45.945 --> 00:37:48.215
Again, this is not all people are gonna be saved,

709
00:37:48.275 --> 00:37:50.655
but he's talking about why hasn't Jesus come back yet?

710
00:37:51.635 --> 00:37:52.815
What's taken so long?

711
00:37:54.155 --> 00:37:57.335
And what Peter says is, wait a minute.

712
00:37:57.445 --> 00:38:02.105
He's, he's being patient so that he doesn't wish any

713
00:38:02.125 --> 00:38:03.745
of his elect to perish.

714
00:38:03.745 --> 00:38:07.385
He's waiting for those who he has chosen to,

715
00:38:07.805 --> 00:38:09.185
to come to Christ.

716
00:38:09.365 --> 00:38:13.425
And so be patient, Christ will return when God is ready.

717
00:38:14.085 --> 00:38:17.105
But again, this is not, God is gonna save all people.

718
00:38:17.265 --> 00:38:21.065
Universalism is not a biblical, uh, concept at all.

719
00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:28.235
Are there many ways to be saved? We hear that a lot today.

720
00:38:28.855 --> 00:38:30.435
All paths lead to God.

721
00:38:31.455 --> 00:38:34.755
Uh, we're all saved just in various ways, different ways.

722
00:38:35.705 --> 00:38:38.755
Um, well, that again, is not biblical.

723
00:38:39.265 --> 00:38:40.835
Acts chapter four, verse 12.

724
00:38:40.835 --> 00:38:43.275
There's salvation in no one else but Jesus.

725
00:38:44.395 --> 00:38:47.015
And there's no other name under heaven that has been given

726
00:38:47.545 --> 00:38:49.855
among men by which we must be saved.

727
00:38:50.365 --> 00:38:54.335
There's only one way to be saved according to scripture,

728
00:38:54.795 --> 00:38:56.495
and that's through Jesus Christ.

729
00:38:57.555 --> 00:39:00.455
So there's literally,

730
00:39:01.055 --> 00:39:05.395
I think over 200 verses just in the New Testament that

731
00:39:05.925 --> 00:39:07.875
state that there's only one way to be saved.

732
00:39:08.175 --> 00:39:10.555
And that's Jesus Christ. Okay?

733
00:39:11.375 --> 00:39:13.115
So all paths lead to God,

734
00:39:13.215 --> 00:39:17.555
or all paths lead to salvation is not biblical at all.

735
00:39:18.295 --> 00:39:20.875
Uh, if you look at, uh,

736
00:39:22.075 --> 00:39:24.055
if you look at Christianity from the outside,

737
00:39:24.055 --> 00:39:26.135
people will say, well, you guys, you're just,

738
00:39:26.135 --> 00:39:27.415
you're too exclusive.

739
00:39:27.485 --> 00:39:31.935
They hate the exclusive, uh, nature of Christianity.

740
00:39:32.605 --> 00:39:34.855
There's only one way that's too exclusive.

741
00:39:34.855 --> 00:39:36.255
You're not including everybody.

742
00:39:37.505 --> 00:39:40.805
The exclusivity of Christianity is offensive to people.

743
00:39:41.815 --> 00:39:43.345
There's only one way to be safe.

744
00:39:43.375 --> 00:39:45.585
Well, that's not very kind, right?

745
00:39:45.585 --> 00:39:46.665
That's not very inclusive.

746
00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:51.185
Um, people level that at Christianity all the time.

747
00:39:51.245 --> 00:39:54.465
Here's the problem with that. Every religion is exclusive.

748
00:39:56.075 --> 00:39:59.255
Uh, Islam has a way

749
00:39:59.315 --> 00:40:01.295
to be saved in Islam, right?

750
00:40:01.685 --> 00:40:06.175
Judaism, uh, Buddhism, Hinduism, there's a way to be saved,

751
00:40:07.565 --> 00:40:09.305
and you only can do it this way, right?

752
00:40:09.645 --> 00:40:14.105
So to say that Christianity is exclusive is

753
00:40:14.665 --> 00:40:15.865
a little disingenuous.

754
00:40:15.965 --> 00:40:18.265
All of them are exclusive in some way.

755
00:40:18.765 --> 00:40:21.665
The difference between Christianity is every other religion

756
00:40:21.805 --> 00:40:24.425
is they teach salvation by works.

757
00:40:25.985 --> 00:40:29.285
You've got to do something to earn your salvation.

758
00:40:29.445 --> 00:40:33.845
Christianity is the only religion where salvation is not

759
00:40:33.945 --> 00:40:37.925
by our works, but by the God we worship his work.

760
00:40:38.665 --> 00:40:41.525
So to me, that's a very clear indication

761
00:40:41.525 --> 00:40:43.765
that Christianity is not manmade.

762
00:40:44.315 --> 00:40:45.805
It's not a manmade religion.

763
00:40:46.355 --> 00:40:50.085
This is a, obviously a divine inspiration,

764
00:40:50.225 --> 00:40:51.485
not something men would write.

765
00:40:51.485 --> 00:40:52.645
If we were to write the Bible,

766
00:40:52.745 --> 00:40:54.685
we would save ourselves somehow.

767
00:40:56.225 --> 00:40:59.305
Christianity is, you can't save yourself.

768
00:40:59.485 --> 00:41:01.145
We wouldn't write something like that.

769
00:41:01.245 --> 00:41:03.345
So this is again, to me, indication

770
00:41:03.345 --> 00:41:05.345
that the Bible is not man's word,

771
00:41:05.345 --> 00:41:10.125
but it's God's word is

772
00:41:10.235 --> 00:41:12.325
baptism necessary for salvation.

773
00:41:12.585 --> 00:41:13.645
You might have heard that one.

774
00:41:13.645 --> 00:41:15.885
There are some denominations who believe this is true.

775
00:41:16.905 --> 00:41:18.645
Uh, I'd have to ask you, first of all,

776
00:41:18.645 --> 00:41:20.285
which baptism are you talking about?

777
00:41:21.025 --> 00:41:23.645
New Testament talks about two baptisms of the Holy Spirit

778
00:41:24.185 --> 00:41:27.805
or baptized into the spirit or baptism of water.

779
00:41:27.865 --> 00:41:30.925
And I think most of the time we're talking about external,

780
00:41:31.985 --> 00:41:34.165
uh, baptism by water.

781
00:41:34.945 --> 00:41:38.005
Uh, some, some denominations do include baptism

782
00:41:38.185 --> 00:41:39.205
for salvation.

783
00:41:39.235 --> 00:41:41.085
It's a requirement for salvation.

784
00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:44.205
Uh, we do not believe that is biblical.

785
00:41:44.665 --> 00:41:48.325
To require something like that to be saved would be to,

786
00:41:49.775 --> 00:41:53.445
again, uh, would be a work, something you would do to

787
00:41:54.825 --> 00:41:56.445
be required for salvation.

788
00:41:57.075 --> 00:41:59.085
Something you would do to earn salvation.

789
00:41:59.865 --> 00:42:03.685
And, uh, if you can earn your salvation through baptism,

790
00:42:03.705 --> 00:42:05.685
or if it's a requirement to be baptized

791
00:42:05.705 --> 00:42:10.245
or something else like the Jews circumcised in the New

792
00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:15.325
Testament, uh, then you're, you're basically devaluing

793
00:42:15.355 --> 00:42:18.245
what Jesus has done for us in salvation.

794
00:42:18.385 --> 00:42:22.285
So, uh, baptism, uh, is not a requirement

795
00:42:22.345 --> 00:42:23.965
to, uh, to be saved.

796
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:29.975
Thank you for the water. That's fantastic.

797
00:42:32.365 --> 00:42:34.585
Uh, almost done here. Question number seven,

798
00:42:35.995 --> 00:42:37.575
how do we maintain our salvation?

799
00:42:37.675 --> 00:42:40.735
Or can we lose our salvation?

800
00:42:42.055 --> 00:42:43.435
Uh, this is a common question.

801
00:42:45.645 --> 00:42:47.905
Uh, Jesus said, I'll give you eternal life,

802
00:42:48.845 --> 00:42:51.905
and they will never perish, ever die.

803
00:42:51.905 --> 00:42:54.025
And no one will snatch them outta my hand.

804
00:42:54.885 --> 00:42:57.945
Uh, he's talking about his sheep here, his followers.

805
00:42:59.435 --> 00:43:02.055
Uh, can we maintain our salvation?

806
00:43:02.115 --> 00:43:03.415
Can we lose our salvation?

807
00:43:04.285 --> 00:43:05.735
I've said several times now,

808
00:43:06.055 --> 00:43:08.535
salvation is entirely a work of God.

809
00:43:09.395 --> 00:43:12.895
If it's a work of God and not of our own, we didn't earn it.

810
00:43:13.515 --> 00:43:15.055
So we cannot lose it.

811
00:43:15.955 --> 00:43:18.135
Uh, we didn't do anything to earn salvation.

812
00:43:18.135 --> 00:43:20.775
Therefore, we can't do anything to lose our salvation.

813
00:43:21.555 --> 00:43:24.535
Uh, God keeps his promises. He says eternal life.

814
00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:27.975
So if he promised you eternal life with salvation,

815
00:43:28.595 --> 00:43:31.095
and he goes, whoops, he just lost his eternal life.

816
00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:32.495
I promised him eternal.

817
00:43:33.475 --> 00:43:35.895
You would have to undo all the benefits.

818
00:43:35.915 --> 00:43:37.975
We just talked about all the benefits.

819
00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:40.895
God says, oh, I'm sorry, you're going back to darkness.

820
00:43:41.595 --> 00:43:43.095
I'm sorry. You're going back to death.

821
00:43:44.035 --> 00:43:48.015
Uh, you'd have to undo all of God's promises to,

822
00:43:49.035 --> 00:43:50.335
to lose your salvation.

823
00:43:50.435 --> 00:43:52.895
And that is not something we see biblically.

824
00:43:53.555 --> 00:43:56.775
Uh, the Lord maintains your salvation, not you.

825
00:43:57.315 --> 00:43:59.855
We read in Ephesians one that he gave you the Holy Spirit.

826
00:43:59.855 --> 00:44:01.535
You're sealed in the spirit.

827
00:44:03.115 --> 00:44:07.495
In other words, you are saved and you will always be saved.

828
00:44:08.315 --> 00:44:12.615
And, uh, there's nothing you can do to lose your salvation.

829
00:44:13.805 --> 00:44:18.035
Okay? But what about Christians who fall away, right?

830
00:44:18.035 --> 00:44:20.475
Christians, we always see Christians rejecting God

831
00:44:20.535 --> 00:44:23.595
or falling away or leaving the faith.

832
00:44:25.055 --> 00:44:27.115
Uh, Jesus says that's gonna happen.

833
00:44:28.835 --> 00:44:30.575
Not everyone who says to me, Lord,

834
00:44:30.605 --> 00:44:32.245
Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven.

835
00:44:32.385 --> 00:44:33.805
In other words, there are a lot of people

836
00:44:33.865 --> 00:44:35.165
who say, Lord, I knew you.

837
00:44:36.025 --> 00:44:37.245
Why don't I get to go to heaven?

838
00:44:37.945 --> 00:44:40.645
And he'll say to them, depart from me. I never knew you.

839
00:44:42.695 --> 00:44:46.915
Uh, in other words, there are a lot of people who claim

840
00:44:46.975 --> 00:44:48.195
to be Christian,

841
00:44:48.335 --> 00:44:52.515
but just claiming to be Christian doesn't mean that you are

842
00:44:53.455 --> 00:44:55.795
indeed a true follower of Christ.

843
00:44:56.335 --> 00:45:00.035
Acting like a Christian going to church, for example,

844
00:45:00.105 --> 00:45:02.635
does not guarantee salvation.

845
00:45:02.635 --> 00:45:07.235
There's a lot of pretenders, I call them false converts,

846
00:45:08.135 --> 00:45:13.035
or people who maybe are acting as wolves among the sheep

847
00:45:13.735 --> 00:45:15.075
who are not believers.

848
00:45:15.105 --> 00:45:18.475
True believers. Can a believer struggle with sin?

849
00:45:19.115 --> 00:45:24.075
Disobedience fall. We say backslide fall away. Absolutely.

850
00:45:24.775 --> 00:45:28.915
Uh, but they will never completely reject Christ.

851
00:45:29.615 --> 00:45:33.635
Um, when Jesus was here, the, the Pharisees said,

852
00:45:34.335 --> 00:45:36.715
he casts out demons in the name of Satan.

853
00:45:38.335 --> 00:45:40.155
And Jesus said, that makes no sense.

854
00:45:41.255 --> 00:45:42.395
If I worked for Satan,

855
00:45:42.395 --> 00:45:43.995
why would I cast demons out of people?

856
00:45:44.655 --> 00:45:48.155
In other words, he says, A house divided against itself

857
00:45:49.285 --> 00:45:50.345
cannot stand.

858
00:45:51.625 --> 00:45:54.005
In other words, why would I work against my own team?

859
00:45:56.255 --> 00:45:59.875
Anyone who has the Holy Spirit in them, the spirit

860
00:45:59.895 --> 00:46:02.915
of God in them, is not gonna reject Jesus Christ.

861
00:46:04.605 --> 00:46:08.825
So if somebody who claims to be Christian leaves the church,

862
00:46:08.925 --> 00:46:13.225
leaves the faith rejects Christ, it's obvious

863
00:46:13.295 --> 00:46:16.465
that they were never first truly a believer.

864
00:46:17.445 --> 00:46:19.625
That's a hard one for us to grasp, but it's true

865
00:46:19.825 --> 00:46:22.025
'cause we all know people who have done that.

866
00:46:24.385 --> 00:46:28.455
So how can I know that I'm saved? Good question.

867
00:46:28.725 --> 00:46:31.695
There's a book of the New Testament written just for you.

868
00:46:31.695 --> 00:46:35.015
First John, if you're doubting your salvation,

869
00:46:35.065 --> 00:46:36.695
first John is just for you.

870
00:46:37.955 --> 00:46:40.655
And the purpose of First John, he says in verse five,

871
00:46:40.655 --> 00:46:43.335
chapter five, verse 13, these things have I written to you

872
00:46:43.335 --> 00:46:47.055
who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may

873
00:46:47.965 --> 00:46:50.335
know that you have eternal life.

874
00:46:50.535 --> 00:46:53.335
I wrote this letter so that you may know

875
00:46:53.365 --> 00:46:54.535
that you have eternal life.

876
00:46:54.535 --> 00:46:56.775
And he gives several indications of people

877
00:46:57.235 --> 00:46:59.615
who are saved will act like this.

878
00:47:00.485 --> 00:47:04.015
They will have an assurance of salvation,

879
00:47:04.015 --> 00:47:06.815
and people struggle with whether they're saved.

880
00:47:07.575 --> 00:47:09.935
I get that. Uh, growing up, you know,

881
00:47:10.425 --> 00:47:13.095
every time there was an invitation given in our service,

882
00:47:13.145 --> 00:47:15.775
there was a certain person who would go down

883
00:47:15.835 --> 00:47:18.935
and rededicate their life or get saved again.

884
00:47:20.725 --> 00:47:25.345
What's happening there? Do we have to do that? Uh, do I?

885
00:47:25.405 --> 00:47:27.305
Am I always doubting? No.

886
00:47:27.405 --> 00:47:32.205
The the Bible wants us to make sure that we know for sure

887
00:47:32.275 --> 00:47:33.285
that we are saved.

888
00:47:33.465 --> 00:47:36.365
He don't want us to doubt our salvation.

889
00:47:36.465 --> 00:47:40.165
We can trust God is who he says he is.

890
00:47:40.225 --> 00:47:42.605
And he's done what he says he has done.

891
00:47:42.745 --> 00:47:45.485
So lemme give you just a few things from one John.

892
00:47:47.735 --> 00:47:49.355
Uh, how can I know that I'm saved?

893
00:47:49.455 --> 00:47:51.355
You've trusted Christ for salvation.

894
00:47:51.385 --> 00:47:54.235
Have you put your faith in Christ for salvation,

895
00:47:54.255 --> 00:47:55.435
for forgiveness of sins?

896
00:47:55.495 --> 00:47:56.875
Yes. Okay.

897
00:47:58.175 --> 00:48:01.555
It is assured that you are saved. You're a new person.

898
00:48:02.615 --> 00:48:06.435
You can tell you're not the old self anymore.

899
00:48:06.435 --> 00:48:08.715
You're a new creature growing in Christ.

900
00:48:09.495 --> 00:48:11.435
Uh, you're indwelled by the Holy Spirit.

901
00:48:11.775 --> 00:48:15.395
You love the Lord John says, and you love his people.

902
00:48:15.455 --> 00:48:18.555
You love his church. And you don't practice sin.

903
00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:20.595
Sin doesn't reign in your life anymore

904
00:48:20.875 --> 00:48:23.275
'cause you've overcome it through Christ.

905
00:48:24.255 --> 00:48:27.035
And so these are some of the indications

906
00:48:27.105 --> 00:48:29.995
that you are indeed saved.

907
00:48:32.205 --> 00:48:36.615
Finally, uh, how do I share the plan of salvation?

908
00:48:36.715 --> 00:48:38.985
You may be asking yourself

909
00:48:38.985 --> 00:48:42.265
that this is such a complicated, uh, doctrine.

910
00:48:42.285 --> 00:48:47.185
How do I share it with someone else? Uh, it is complicated.

911
00:48:47.185 --> 00:48:49.425
There's no doubt. It's some of it's hard to understand,

912
00:48:49.605 --> 00:48:51.385
but it's a very simple message.

913
00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:53.185
It's a very simple message.

914
00:48:54.245 --> 00:48:57.545
You are a sinner and you cannot save yourself.

915
00:48:57.895 --> 00:49:00.825
Only God can save you. And he does it through Jesus Christ.

916
00:49:01.695 --> 00:49:04.635
It's not that hard to share the gospel.

917
00:49:04.855 --> 00:49:06.315
Now, several years ago, we went

918
00:49:06.665 --> 00:49:09.155
through a book called What is the Gospel?

919
00:49:09.285 --> 00:49:11.235
Y'all may remember this if you were here then.

920
00:49:11.295 --> 00:49:15.475
And, and, uh, the author gives us four kind of hooks

921
00:49:16.375 --> 00:49:19.035
to remember for sharing the gospel.

922
00:49:19.455 --> 00:49:22.075
God, man, Christ in response. Anybody here?

923
00:49:22.075 --> 00:49:25.475
When we did that, that was, I forget what year that was,

924
00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:26.555
but that was outstanding.

925
00:49:26.735 --> 00:49:30.875
One of my favorite, uh, books, God, man, Christ response.

926
00:49:31.095 --> 00:49:32.675
God, you, you're talking to somebody.

927
00:49:32.675 --> 00:49:36.075
You just talk to 'em about God first, not you don't jump

928
00:49:36.075 --> 00:49:40.075
to Christ, just God and the attributes of God.

929
00:49:40.075 --> 00:49:41.635
We believe that God created the heavens

930
00:49:41.835 --> 00:49:45.115
and the earth, everything, including you and me.

931
00:49:46.755 --> 00:49:50.415
And he is sovereign. He's in charge. He makes the rules.

932
00:49:51.275 --> 00:49:53.975
He is holy and righteous and sinless.

933
00:49:53.995 --> 00:49:56.095
You just described what the Bible says

934
00:49:56.095 --> 00:49:57.415
about God's attributes.

935
00:49:57.475 --> 00:49:59.775
We just, we just went through God's attributes

936
00:50:00.755 --> 00:50:05.255
and he made man kind in the image of God.

937
00:50:05.365 --> 00:50:08.415
Therefore, we are valuable and we have purpose

938
00:50:08.555 --> 00:50:11.495
and dignity in life, but we rebelled against God

939
00:50:12.995 --> 00:50:15.455
and we sinned against him.

940
00:50:16.665 --> 00:50:18.885
And we've inherited the sinful nature

941
00:50:19.065 --> 00:50:20.885
and we're broken and imperfect.

942
00:50:21.625 --> 00:50:23.165
No one's gonna say they're perfect.

943
00:50:24.495 --> 00:50:28.685
Everybody's gonna say, uh, uh, admit that they're imperfect

944
00:50:29.265 --> 00:50:31.125
unless you ask 'em, are you a good person?

945
00:50:32.345 --> 00:50:34.445
Nobody seems to know the answer to that.

946
00:50:34.465 --> 00:50:36.285
But they always say, yes, I'm a good person.

947
00:50:36.715 --> 00:50:39.725
Have you ever told a lie? Oh, well, sure I have.

948
00:50:40.475 --> 00:50:44.125
Have you ever stolen anything? Well, yeah. Okay.

949
00:50:44.145 --> 00:50:45.325
So you're not a good person.

950
00:50:45.465 --> 00:50:48.445
You have to kind of maybe show them some a little bit

951
00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:49.925
that they're not perfect.

952
00:50:50.065 --> 00:50:51.685
But we all, I think we all

953
00:50:51.895 --> 00:50:53.365
understand that we're not perfect.

954
00:50:53.705 --> 00:50:56.205
God, man. What do we do?

955
00:50:56.345 --> 00:50:59.245
How, how do we reconcile our relationship with God?

956
00:50:59.245 --> 00:51:02.205
You talk about Christ and his attributes.

957
00:51:02.475 --> 00:51:05.645
He's sinless and he was the God man, and,

958
00:51:06.105 --> 00:51:08.805
and he died for our sins on the cross.

959
00:51:08.905 --> 00:51:10.285
You talked about the sacrifice

960
00:51:10.345 --> 00:51:11.925
and the forgiveness that he offers.

961
00:51:12.665 --> 00:51:16.365
And all you have to do is receive that gift, right?

962
00:51:16.395 --> 00:51:19.005
Receive that luggage that we talked about.

963
00:51:19.105 --> 00:51:21.685
Put your faith in Christ. You can do this.

964
00:51:21.875 --> 00:51:26.045
This is, don't worry about all the intricate doc,

965
00:51:26.145 --> 00:51:29.245
the the other tangents that I just took, uh,

966
00:51:29.245 --> 00:51:31.045
regarding the doctrine of salvation.

967
00:51:31.665 --> 00:51:33.245
Uh, keep it very, very simple.

968
00:51:33.345 --> 00:51:36.965
And then God will do the rest. Um, what if they reject me?

969
00:51:37.475 --> 00:51:39.805
What if they turn me down again?

970
00:51:40.785 --> 00:51:42.685
Our job is to fish for men.

971
00:51:42.835 --> 00:51:45.885
It's not to grab the fish and strangle them

972
00:51:45.885 --> 00:51:47.205
and bring them into the boat.

973
00:51:47.905 --> 00:51:50.125
Uh, we fish and let God do the rest.

974
00:51:50.785 --> 00:51:52.325
And if they reject you, okay.

975
00:51:52.495 --> 00:51:53.845
Share the gospel with somebody else.

976
00:51:55.525 --> 00:51:57.495
Some will respond, some won't.

977
00:51:58.085 --> 00:52:01.335
Alright, that was a lot of information,

978
00:52:01.995 --> 00:52:03.895
but we have, uh, just a few minutes here.

979
00:52:03.955 --> 00:52:05.295
I'd love to see, uh,

980
00:52:05.405 --> 00:52:07.575
what questions have come to mind for you.

981
00:52:08.275 --> 00:52:11.215
And if not, I will pray us out and we will get outta here.

982
00:52:11.955 --> 00:52:14.255
But, uh, anything come to mind just

983
00:52:14.915 --> 00:52:16.575
during this, uh, during this time,

984
00:52:16.935 --> 00:52:18.095
I wanted to mention, uh,

985
00:52:18.385 --> 00:52:20.335
Aaron was talking about sharing the gospel.

986
00:52:22.145 --> 00:52:26.095
I wanted to have some evangelism training beginning on,

987
00:52:26.195 --> 00:52:27.655
uh, February 26th.

988
00:52:28.185 --> 00:52:31.935
There are four classes, um, seven to 8:00 PM

989
00:52:32.875 --> 00:52:34.455
Topics are what is evangelism?

990
00:52:35.035 --> 00:52:38.175
Um, sharing the gospel at work, sharing the gospel of school

991
00:52:38.715 --> 00:52:40.665
and sharing the gospel with Muslims.

992
00:52:41.205 --> 00:52:44.705
And so that's an opportunity beginning on February 26th, uh,

993
00:52:44.705 --> 00:52:47.465
once a month put on by our admissions team. So,

994
00:52:47.815 --> 00:52:48.815
Very good. Mentioned that.

995
00:52:48.815 --> 00:52:51.465
And, uh, also, uh, on our website,

996
00:52:51.515 --> 00:52:55.465
under the, uh, category of resources, there is a very, um,

997
00:52:56.905 --> 00:53:01.025
excellent, um, information on, uh, the gospel,

998
00:53:01.805 --> 00:53:05.585
uh, along with, uh, uh, a video, uh,

999
00:53:06.125 --> 00:53:07.385
titled The Three Circles.

1000
00:53:07.925 --> 00:53:12.345
And then it talks about, uh, god, uh, man, uh, Christ

1001
00:53:12.405 --> 00:53:14.305
and response, which Aaron just went over.

1002
00:53:14.365 --> 00:53:18.105
So there are resources available, uh, that would provide,

1003
00:53:18.485 --> 00:53:21.065
um, some information about how to share the gospel.

1004
00:53:21.125 --> 00:53:22.305
So just wanna mention that. So

1005
00:53:22.435 --> 00:53:23.435
Thank you, Steve.

1006
00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.360
Steve, you can join me up here

1007
00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.820
for stay down there and whichever you wanna do.

1008
00:53:29.315 --> 00:53:30.975
Uh, Victor question,

1009
00:53:31.265 --> 00:53:32.265
Aaron.

1010
00:53:32.635 --> 00:53:35.455
Um, thanks for all that explanation.

1011
00:53:35.965 --> 00:53:40.295
I've always had trouble understanding in Matthew 13,

1012
00:53:40.355 --> 00:53:43.825
the parables of the sower, where it says, um,

1013
00:53:44.335 --> 00:53:46.025
when anyone hears the word of the kingdom

1014
00:53:46.245 --> 00:53:49.185
and does not understand it, the evil one comes

1015
00:53:49.245 --> 00:53:51.665
and snatches away what has been sewn in his heart.

1016
00:53:52.775 --> 00:53:56.465
That is what, this is what was sewn along the path.

1017
00:53:57.005 --> 00:53:58.825
And for what was sewn on rocky ground.

1018
00:53:58.895 --> 00:54:00.385
This is the one who hears the word

1019
00:54:00.445 --> 00:54:02.105
and immediately receives it with the joy.

1020
00:54:03.005 --> 00:54:05.665
Yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while.

1021
00:54:05.765 --> 00:54:09.105
And when tribulation or persecution arise on account

1022
00:54:09.105 --> 00:54:11.625
of the word, immediately, he falls away.

1023
00:54:12.525 --> 00:54:14.385
And then he talks about the thorns.

1024
00:54:14.815 --> 00:54:17.105
This is one who hears the word, but the cares of the world

1025
00:54:17.105 --> 00:54:19.585
and deceitfulness of riches choke the word

1026
00:54:19.685 --> 00:54:21.145
and proves it unfruitful.

1027
00:54:21.885 --> 00:54:24.985
And then lastly, what is so on good soul?

1028
00:54:25.535 --> 00:54:28.265
That is the one who hears the word and understands it.

1029
00:54:28.925 --> 00:54:33.675
So I'm, I've never understood when we talk about the elect,

1030
00:54:35.355 --> 00:54:37.735
if those people who fell away

1031
00:54:37.735 --> 00:54:41.685
after hearing what happened if,

1032
00:54:41.825 --> 00:54:46.315
if you considered them not chosen,

1033
00:54:46.815 --> 00:54:48.875
and they heard they wanted to believe,

1034
00:54:48.975 --> 00:54:52.675
but I don't know, can you reconcile that for us?

1035
00:54:52.825 --> 00:54:56.355
Yeah. Those are different responses to, to God's word,

1036
00:54:56.495 --> 00:54:57.635
to the gospel.

1037
00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:02.515
And Jesus is describing these various responses.

1038
00:55:03.575 --> 00:55:08.555
And so, again, we don't know, at least I don't know who

1039
00:55:09.375 --> 00:55:11.395
is who, whom God has chosen.

1040
00:55:11.615 --> 00:55:14.265
So we do cast the seed,

1041
00:55:14.365 --> 00:55:16.185
but there's gonna be various responses.

1042
00:55:16.605 --> 00:55:21.145
We all know people who today may not be saved

1043
00:55:21.325 --> 00:55:23.785
or, uh, a a genuine believer,

1044
00:55:23.925 --> 00:55:27.825
but they may have gotten excited about church at one time,

1045
00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:32.545
or they were reading their Bible, or they heard the message

1046
00:55:32.805 --> 00:55:34.745
and they were so excited at camp.

1047
00:55:34.845 --> 00:55:39.265
All these kinds of things, they, they, uh, the Bible says,

1048
00:55:39.325 --> 00:55:43.805
tasted this good news, but it never took root.

1049
00:55:44.545 --> 00:55:48.685
And so, um, again, we, we, we have to believe

1050
00:55:48.685 --> 00:55:51.085
that God has his purposes here,

1051
00:55:51.145 --> 00:55:55.045
but these are various responses to the, the good news.

1052
00:55:55.425 --> 00:55:59.055
And, uh, I, I have to trust

1053
00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:01.855
that God has his purposes for who that is and,

1054
00:56:01.955 --> 00:56:03.735
and who responds and who doesn't.

1055
00:56:04.605 --> 00:56:06.265
So good, good question.

1056
00:56:07.225 --> 00:56:08.985
I have friends that, you know,

1057
00:56:09.885 --> 00:56:11.745
got excited at camp just like I did.

1058
00:56:12.025 --> 00:56:15.265
I gave my life to Christ, but, and they were so excited,

1059
00:56:15.325 --> 00:56:19.265
but then they just kind of died off, uh, that, that, that,

1060
00:56:19.365 --> 00:56:21.905
uh, excitement died off,

1061
00:56:21.965 --> 00:56:24.755
and they never did follow through.

1062
00:56:24.785 --> 00:56:26.555
What, what was the deal? The enemy came

1063
00:56:26.555 --> 00:56:30.245
and stole their, you know, choked out their seed,

1064
00:56:30.305 --> 00:56:31.405
choked out their plant.

1065
00:56:32.615 --> 00:56:34.945
Perhaps they weren't, it wasn't their time.

1066
00:56:35.215 --> 00:56:39.405
Perhaps they weren't meant to be a believer, I don't know.

1067
00:56:39.705 --> 00:56:42.485
But, um, I think that's what Jesus is describing there.

1068
00:56:43.735 --> 00:56:45.445
Steve, anything else you wanna add to

1069
00:56:45.445 --> 00:56:46.645
that? I think that's a great question.

1070
00:56:46.795 --> 00:56:48.085
Very similar experience at camp.

1071
00:56:48.205 --> 00:56:50.965
I was saved at Falls Creek, uh, church camp.

1072
00:56:51.505 --> 00:56:53.615
And, um, I just go back

1073
00:56:53.615 --> 00:56:58.325
and think about that 50 a long time ago.

1074
00:56:58.865 --> 00:57:03.685
And, uh, I think about friends that, that, uh, close friends

1075
00:57:04.555 --> 00:57:09.375
that walked the aisle, and there was a lot of emotions.

1076
00:57:10.155 --> 00:57:12.375
And now as I think back about our lives

1077
00:57:12.435 --> 00:57:15.495
and how our pasts have crossed from time to time, I

1078
00:57:16.855 --> 00:57:19.415
remember them making a decision and wondering, okay, was

1079
00:57:19.415 --> 00:57:22.695
that how, how has their life turned out differently?

1080
00:57:23.155 --> 00:57:26.775
And what do they really believe now? So happens? Yeah. Yeah.

1081
00:57:27.555 --> 00:57:28.575
Oh, yes ma'am. Yeah.

1082
00:57:29.155 --> 00:57:31.855
Um, so mine has to do with, um, the question,

1083
00:57:32.035 --> 00:57:33.495
can Christians fall away?

1084
00:57:33.595 --> 00:57:37.495
And I agree that the idea of falling away doesn't seem

1085
00:57:37.495 --> 00:57:40.775
to fit with the imagery that's used in salvation,

1086
00:57:40.985 --> 00:57:44.255
we're made alive in Christ, we are born again.

1087
00:57:44.675 --> 00:57:48.575
But there are, um, denominations that they have some verses

1088
00:57:48.645 --> 00:57:52.575
that they claim don't seem to fit with the idea that, well,

1089
00:57:52.575 --> 00:57:55.095
if they fell away, then they were never saved to begin with.

1090
00:57:55.835 --> 00:57:59.655
Um, ones like Hebrews 10, 26

1091
00:57:59.655 --> 00:58:03.455
through 27 saying, for if we go on sinning deliberately

1092
00:58:03.545 --> 00:58:05.535
after receiving the knowledge of the truth,

1093
00:58:06.105 --> 00:58:09.335
there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,

1094
00:58:09.355 --> 00:58:11.615
but a fearful expectation of judgment

1095
00:58:11.915 --> 00:58:14.895
and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.

1096
00:58:15.835 --> 00:58:20.335
Um, first Timothy 18 through 19, uh,

1097
00:58:20.365 --> 00:58:22.935
Paul is talking to Timothy about holding the faith

1098
00:58:23.035 --> 00:58:24.135
and good conscience,

1099
00:58:24.195 --> 00:58:26.095
and that by rejecting this, um,

1100
00:58:26.095 --> 00:58:27.895
have made a shipwreck of their faith.

1101
00:58:28.635 --> 00:58:33.535
Uh, he says in Galatians five, four, talking to those

1102
00:58:33.555 --> 00:58:34.975
who were trying to enforce the law

1103
00:58:34.975 --> 00:58:37.815
and circumcision in order to be saved, saying

1104
00:58:37.885 --> 00:58:41.495
that you have been severed from Christ who you,

1105
00:58:41.555 --> 00:58:43.535
who would've been justified by the law,

1106
00:58:43.875 --> 00:58:45.695
you have fallen away from grace.

1107
00:58:46.195 --> 00:58:48.295
And then they'll also bring up examples like

1108
00:58:48.355 --> 00:58:51.775
how the Spirit came on Saul in the Old Testament,

1109
00:58:51.775 --> 00:58:52.815
and then it left him.

1110
00:58:53.315 --> 00:58:57.575
So the question is, how do we reconcile those verses

1111
00:58:58.045 --> 00:59:02.295
with the idea that our salvation still can't be lost?

1112
00:59:02.525 --> 00:59:03.975
Yeah, those are great questions.

1113
00:59:05.555 --> 00:59:09.255
Uh, the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit, uh,

1114
00:59:09.385 --> 00:59:11.375
acted differently in the Old Testament.

1115
00:59:12.405 --> 00:59:15.055
Saul, you brought up Saul, then he does in the New Testament

1116
00:59:15.115 --> 00:59:16.935
and dwells believers continually.

1117
00:59:17.035 --> 00:59:19.095
We, we know that, uh,

1118
00:59:19.115 --> 00:59:21.055
but he did not do that in the Old Testament.

1119
00:59:21.265 --> 00:59:24.525
He indwelled and left and in dwelled and left. Mm-Hmm.

1120
00:59:24.605 --> 00:59:28.165
And so, um, Saul is not a good example there to bring up,

1121
00:59:28.425 --> 00:59:32.325
uh, regarding the s doctrine of salvation.

1122
00:59:32.945 --> 00:59:35.045
You have to keep in mind, Hebrews is written to,

1123
00:59:35.045 --> 00:59:38.765
Hebrews is written to Jews, Christians who were Jewish,

1124
00:59:39.815 --> 00:59:44.785
struggling with, uh, Judaism, how do they reconcile Judaism,

1125
00:59:45.005 --> 00:59:47.545
you know, judaistic rituals

1126
00:59:47.645 --> 00:59:50.305
and things with what Christ has done.

1127
00:59:50.405 --> 00:59:55.265
And so the writer is trying to explain to them, uh, the,

1128
00:59:56.205 --> 00:59:59.705
you know, how do you deal with the ritual of circumcision

1129
00:59:59.845 --> 01:00:02.465
or the rituals of, you know, Sabbath

1130
01:00:02.605 --> 01:00:04.465
or sacrificing and all that.

1131
01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:05.665
So, uh,

1132
01:00:05.665 --> 01:00:08.265
what he's talking about there is you've got this gospel

1133
01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:10.065
that frees you from all these things.

1134
01:00:10.995 --> 01:00:15.765
Don't forsake this for this. Does that make sense?

1135
01:00:16.065 --> 01:00:19.445
So again, you gotta look at the context of the verses,

1136
01:00:19.445 --> 01:00:21.885
the passages, the book, the reason why it was written.

1137
01:00:22.745 --> 01:00:26.765
Uh, so yeah, I, I see what they say, what they're meaning

1138
01:00:26.905 --> 01:00:31.325
by, you know, it appears that Christians can fall away, the,

1139
01:00:31.665 --> 01:00:36.125
the, uh, but the, the context that the, the,

1140
01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:39.005
the bigger picture here is we know that

1141
01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:40.805
it's not ours to lose.

1142
01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:43.765
We, we didn't do anything to earn it.

1143
01:00:43.865 --> 01:00:45.645
So it's not ours to lose.

1144
01:00:45.905 --> 01:00:48.965
God is faithful and he'll hold onto his own.

1145
01:00:49.065 --> 01:00:51.605
So why would he elect some and then say, oops, I lost him.

1146
01:00:52.425 --> 01:00:53.805
You know what I mean? So we, we trust,

1147
01:00:53.945 --> 01:00:56.865
we put our trust in God for, um,

1148
01:00:57.405 --> 01:01:00.385
per preserving those that he has elected.

1149
01:01:01.055 --> 01:01:02.345
Hope that makes sense. Mm-Hmm.

1150
01:01:02.475 --> 01:01:05.025
Steve, any, anything else there? Okay, good question.

1151
01:01:05.025 --> 01:01:07.225
Really good question. One more, maybe. Yeah, one more.

1152
01:01:07.225 --> 01:01:08.345
We gotta pray and get outta here.

1153
01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:12.185
Okay. Um, so you kind of hit on my question

1154
01:01:12.215 --> 01:01:14.065
with your last slide a little bit,

1155
01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:15.225
but I'm hoping you can maybe

1156
01:01:15.225 --> 01:01:16.465
give a little more clarification.

1157
01:01:16.615 --> 01:01:18.065
Okay. Or just help me understand.

1158
01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:20.625
So, um, the relationship really

1159
01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:23.545
between these foundational big rock issues

1160
01:01:23.545 --> 01:01:27.345
that we've been talking about and our, like, our salvation.

1161
01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:32.305
So here's kinda my question is, is our salvation as simple

1162
01:01:32.405 --> 01:01:36.745
as repentance of our sin and belief in Jesus as our savior?

1163
01:01:37.605 --> 01:01:42.345
Or are these foundational big rocks also necessary knowledge

1164
01:01:43.045 --> 01:01:44.225
for our salvation?

1165
01:01:44.925 --> 01:01:46.865
And so let me just explain real quick

1166
01:01:46.895 --> 01:01:48.105
kind of like what I mean by that.

1167
01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:50.985
If you're not tracking, so like some people have kind

1168
01:01:50.985 --> 01:01:55.225
of summarized this idea, uh, with belief in versus belief

1169
01:01:55.255 --> 01:01:59.945
that, and so like in, um, James two 19, it says, you believe

1170
01:01:59.945 --> 01:02:01.905
that God is one, you do well, right?

1171
01:02:01.905 --> 01:02:04.065
Uh, even the demons believe in shudder, right?

1172
01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:07.785
And so we know that even the demons believe in attributes

1173
01:02:07.785 --> 01:02:09.025
of God, that God is one.

1174
01:02:09.175 --> 01:02:11.985
Obviously it's not a, a saving faith.

1175
01:02:12.405 --> 01:02:14.625
And so then when I look at like my own life,

1176
01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:16.505
I look back at when God saved me.

1177
01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:20.525
I don't think I could have articulated salvation by works

1178
01:02:20.705 --> 01:02:23.525
or, you know, all the attributes of God, right?

1179
01:02:23.665 --> 01:02:26.445
Um, and so just kinda to repeat my question, um,

1180
01:02:27.105 --> 01:02:30.765
so is our salvation as simple as repent of our sin

1181
01:02:30.785 --> 01:02:32.605
and believe in Jesus as our savior?

1182
01:02:33.185 --> 01:02:36.045
Um, or are these foundational big rocks

1183
01:02:36.715 --> 01:02:38.005
also necessary knowledge?

1184
01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:40.445
Do we have to believe that they are true to be saved?

1185
01:02:40.825 --> 01:02:44.205
That's a great question. You, you nailed it. It's simple.

1186
01:02:45.465 --> 01:02:47.765
Uh, faith in Christ, repentance of sin,

1187
01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:49.565
faith in Christ, you're saved.

1188
01:02:50.425 --> 01:02:52.385
I don't think, I mean, Jews believe there's a

1189
01:02:52.385 --> 01:02:54.265
God, they believe in God.

1190
01:02:54.275 --> 01:02:56.905
Maybe not the God that we believe necessarily,

1191
01:02:57.045 --> 01:02:58.945
but a lot of people believe in God,

1192
01:02:58.945 --> 01:03:00.865
but don't put their faith in Christ.

1193
01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:03.505
So, uh, I think the knowledge

1194
01:03:03.505 --> 01:03:05.465
of all these doctrines will come later.

1195
01:03:06.275 --> 01:03:08.905
Think about a child, a child doesn't understand all these

1196
01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:13.145
doctrines, but they can put their faith in Christ that God,

1197
01:03:14.195 --> 01:03:16.865
their sinners, and God has saved them through Christ.

1198
01:03:16.965 --> 01:03:18.465
So I think I, you nailed it.

1199
01:03:18.585 --> 01:03:22.785
I think absolutely you can come to the Lord in faith,

1200
01:03:23.815 --> 01:03:26.755
asking forgiveness of sin without understanding all the

1201
01:03:26.755 --> 01:03:28.115
intricacies of the doctrines.

1202
01:03:28.265 --> 01:03:30.805
Yeah, absolutely. Steve, anything you wanna

1203
01:03:31.485 --> 01:03:32.605
A hundred percent. That was really

1204
01:03:32.605 --> 01:03:33.605
Good. Good

1205
01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:35.275
question. Okay.

1206
01:03:35.325 --> 01:03:37.435
We'll be down front if you have any other questions.

1207
01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:39.235
Thank you all so much for being here.

1208
01:03:39.335 --> 01:03:41.515
I'm gonna ask Steve to close this in a word of prayer.

1209
01:03:41.575 --> 01:03:43.235
And happy Valentine's Day.

1210
01:03:45.565 --> 01:03:47.325
