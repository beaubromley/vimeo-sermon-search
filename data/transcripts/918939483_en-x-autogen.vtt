WEBVTT

1
00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:51.525
Good morning again, church.

2
00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:54.205
What a blessing it is to gather together every Sunday in

3
00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:55.285
this room together

4
00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:59.085
and to be able to worship the Lord together, to be nurtured

5
00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:00.765
as believers and then challenged

6
00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:04.645
to go live sent it is something we don't take for granted,

7
00:01:04.645 --> 00:01:05.685
shouldn't take for granted.

8
00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:07.885
A couple housekeeping items just

9
00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:09.565
before we get into it too far, members,

10
00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:11.805
you're gonna get an email today about, uh,

11
00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.765
our financial ministry plan for the next 12 months.

12
00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:16.005
So make sure you take a look at that lot info there.

13
00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:18.405
There's also paper copies out there if you want that,

14
00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:20.285
that would be better for you either way.

15
00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:22.605
Uh, you've also heard me mention our church

16
00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:24.085
app a lot recently.

17
00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:26.605
Just as a reminder that we have one, if you don't have it

18
00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:29.805
yet, you can actually head to hhbc.com/connect.

19
00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:32.565
There's a link there. You can get it easily that way.

20
00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:34.965
Also, I send out an email every week.

21
00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:37.045
I don't know if you even know that that happens,

22
00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:40.685
but uh, hopefully some deep thoughts maybe in there every

23
00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:43.325
once in a while, but then also some events and updates

24
00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:44.565
and some notices

25
00:01:44.565 --> 00:01:46.365
and what's coming up next Sunday, things like that.

26
00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:48.085
So if you want to get that, go to that link

27
00:01:48.085 --> 00:01:49.125
that's on your notes as well.

28
00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:53.275
You can sign up there now. We're ending soon.

29
00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:55.755
Our sermon series called First Things First.

30
00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:58.955
We've been walking through the last couple months about the

31
00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:00.355
core doctrines of our faith.

32
00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:02.195
What are the things that are the,

33
00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.835
the distinctly Christian beliefs that we have,

34
00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:06.675
why we believe them, those kind of things.

35
00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:09.795
Uh, the beliefs that we should put into our theological jar.

36
00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:11.835
First, the big rocks.

37
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.835
First things like God's revelation of himself,

38
00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:18.915
his attributes, the trinity, uh, God,

39
00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:21.355
the son incarnate, taking on flesh.

40
00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.355
We looked at humanity and what that means about us.

41
00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.195
And then also salvation, how person is saved.

42
00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:29.595
And so what we did last week though,

43
00:02:29.695 --> 00:02:32.395
as we shifted away from the big rocks into

44
00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:36.475
the secondary things of our faith, the interpretations

45
00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:37.475
of things that begin

46
00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:40.835
to separate believers into churches and denominations.

47
00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:42.155
Why do we have multiple churches?

48
00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:43.275
Why are there different denominations?

49
00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:44.395
We looked at those kind of things.

50
00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:47.115
We saw that was the smaller rocks that fit in

51
00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:49.155
around the bigger rocks.

52
00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:52.235
'cause remember, if somebody has the same big rock beliefs,

53
00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:54.315
then they're brothers and sisters in Christ

54
00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:55.875
and we're in this together

55
00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:58.355
and we're gonna be together forever, uh,

56
00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:00.285
with God in eternity.

57
00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:03.005
And so that's where we have to land, that those are brothers

58
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:04.445
and sisters and we're not against them.

59
00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:05.965
We're on the same team of those

60
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.285
who would believe those things.

61
00:03:08.505 --> 00:03:11.085
Now next week, as you've watched the video now

62
00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:13.485
so many times, you know, something else is coming next week

63
00:03:13.815 --> 00:03:16.845
where we're gonna get into the third level things

64
00:03:17.035 --> 00:03:18.885
that differ among believers,

65
00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:21.485
that we can still be in the same church together

66
00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:23.445
and differ on some of those beliefs.

67
00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:26.965
And so we're gonna get into the sand of our faith,

68
00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:29.885
especially regarding Christian liberty, meaning

69
00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:31.085
what we have the freedom to do

70
00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:33.245
or not do as believers and why.

71
00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:35.125
So we're gonna get into that next week.

72
00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:37.485
Uh, hint hint, that is the final sermon

73
00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:38.565
series of the series.

74
00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:39.765
So just know that's coming.

75
00:03:41.065 --> 00:03:44.585
Before we get to the sand though, today

76
00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:48.105
what I wanna do is articulate one of the distinctives

77
00:03:48.245 --> 00:03:51.425
of our church, one of the theological principles

78
00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:54.945
that we hold as very important here.

79
00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:59.685
So it's kind of a small rock to us, you might say.

80
00:03:59.685 --> 00:04:02.045
It also points to a lot of big rock items.

81
00:04:03.985 --> 00:04:07.525
Yet at the same time, I don't want it to be seen

82
00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:11.805
as something that you have to fully align on in order

83
00:04:11.805 --> 00:04:12.845
to be a part of our church.

84
00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:15.525
We're not giving theological tests

85
00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:17.005
as people walk in the door, right?

86
00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:21.405
So the idea here is yes, it's a small rock, it's a big deal

87
00:04:21.405 --> 00:04:22.685
to us and you'll hear it,

88
00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:26.125
but it's also got qualities of sand that you can differ

89
00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:28.005
and still be here.

90
00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:30.565
So what I'm talking about is commonly known

91
00:04:30.565 --> 00:04:32.085
as reformed Theology.

92
00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:37.615
Theology. And lemme just say upfront, this is hard.

93
00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:41.495
It's hard, especially

94
00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:42.575
because to some of you,

95
00:04:42.575 --> 00:04:44.135
this will be completely new information.

96
00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:45.855
Never even heard anything about this before.

97
00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:47.935
Okay, great, let's talk about it.

98
00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:53.135
But it's also hard because it has some gnarly words in it,

99
00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:57.255
like predestination, an election free will, how

100
00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.055
that all works together, how God saves,

101
00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:01.655
what's our part like there, there's all of that

102
00:05:02.315 --> 00:05:03.335
gnarly conversation

103
00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:05.455
that can really trip people up along the way.

104
00:05:05.455 --> 00:05:07.655
And it's been debated for hundreds, if not thousands

105
00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:09.655
of years about these things.

106
00:05:09.835 --> 00:05:11.495
I'm gonna fix it here in 30 minutes, right?

107
00:05:11.595 --> 00:05:16.575
No, it's just part of the, the hard part of this.

108
00:05:16.595 --> 00:05:20.855
That's why my hope is to clear up what we even mean

109
00:05:21.695 --> 00:05:23.105
when we say that a little bit.

110
00:05:23.765 --> 00:05:25.945
And also to clear up some misconceptions, some,

111
00:05:26.255 --> 00:05:27.545
some caricatures.

112
00:05:28.255 --> 00:05:32.145
What caricatures of those things in a lot of the ways

113
00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:35.385
as well, just to clear some things as along, along the way.

114
00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:39.785
But, but also one of the goals is that we, we shouldn't have

115
00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:42.265
to be angry about these things.

116
00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:47.255
We shouldn't be antagonistic about these kinds of things.

117
00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:49.575
And so I hope to show you there a little bit.

118
00:05:49.575 --> 00:05:50.735
So again, lemme just be clear.

119
00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:55.495
If you differ on some of these nuances of these things, then

120
00:05:56.235 --> 00:05:58.575
let me say to you, you're welcome here.

121
00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:03.235
This is something that we want you to know

122
00:06:03.235 --> 00:06:05.555
that even though we're, we don't talk about it a whole lot,

123
00:06:05.655 --> 00:06:07.275
I'm not doing sermon series on this,

124
00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:10.075
I'm just just letting you know that it's gonna be the flavor

125
00:06:10.145 --> 00:06:12.275
that you do kind of catch over time here.

126
00:06:12.785 --> 00:06:15.675
This is, this is where we stand back here, but, but,

127
00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:18.435
but you'll see where the big rock items are and

128
00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:19.715
and that's where we're together on.

129
00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:22.755
So we can walk towards that as you'll see.

130
00:06:23.985 --> 00:06:25.805
But here's the other reality of this.

131
00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:27.965
A couple weeks ago I preached on the last things,

132
00:06:28.025 --> 00:06:31.005
the end times that there's some of that that we won't know

133
00:06:31.005 --> 00:06:33.045
until the end, until it actually happens.

134
00:06:33.105 --> 00:06:35.725
We just won't know, maybe even not know at all.

135
00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:39.125
There's parts of this that will be like that as well.

136
00:06:39.835 --> 00:06:43.365
That there's a mystery in how God does this sometimes.

137
00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:44.885
And theologians have debated

138
00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:49.005
and discussed that throughout the generations there's some

139
00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:51.525
of this that we just won't be able to grasp.

140
00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:56.755
And that's okay because the Lord is the Lord and we're not.

141
00:06:57.805 --> 00:07:00.745
We should seek to understand and try to and we will.

142
00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:04.145
But let's also be gracious with this

143
00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:07.025
as we go forward knowing that there's differences.

144
00:07:07.085 --> 00:07:08.945
But there's also stuff we're just not gonna

145
00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:10.425
grasp as we walk into this.

146
00:07:11.165 --> 00:07:13.785
Now I wrestled of course with how to even present this.

147
00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:16.065
How do I go through this today?

148
00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:20.505
Well, I believe the Lord just said let my word speak. Okay?

149
00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:22.505
So take your copy of God's Word

150
00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:25.065
and turn with me to the book of Ephesians.

151
00:07:26.405 --> 00:07:29.545
Paul's letter to the Ephesian church in the New Testament.

152
00:07:30.665 --> 00:07:34.925
Be in Ephesians chapter one verses three through 14 today.

153
00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:37.605
Really one long sentence in the original language

154
00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:41.365
and we're just gonna see what it teaches us about who God is

155
00:07:41.385 --> 00:07:42.805
and how he works and what he does.

156
00:07:44.175 --> 00:07:45.635
I'm gonna read it all and then we'll pray.

157
00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:47.235
Ephesians one, three through 14,

158
00:07:50.465 --> 00:07:51.555
blessed be the God

159
00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:53.195
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

160
00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.355
who has blessed us in Christ

161
00:07:55.355 --> 00:07:58.635
with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even

162
00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:00.155
as he chose us in him

163
00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:03.435
before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy

164
00:08:03.575 --> 00:08:06.925
and blameless before Him in love.

165
00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:10.365
He predestined us for adoption to himself as sons

166
00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:14.015
through Jesus Christ according to the purpose of his will,

167
00:08:14.555 --> 00:08:16.495
to the praise of His glorious grace

168
00:08:17.245 --> 00:08:20.405
with which he's blessed us in the beloved in him,

169
00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:23.525
we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness

170
00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:27.085
of our trespasses according to the riches of His grace,

171
00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:29.445
which he lavished upon us in all wisdom

172
00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:33.125
and insight making known to us the mystery of his will,

173
00:08:33.715 --> 00:08:36.885
according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ

174
00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:39.045
as a plan for the fullness of time

175
00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:42.245
to unite all things in him, things in heaven

176
00:08:42.665 --> 00:08:45.595
and things on earth in him,

177
00:08:45.605 --> 00:08:48.555
we've obtained an inheritance having been predestined

178
00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:49.795
according to the purpose of Him

179
00:08:49.855 --> 00:08:52.435
who works all things according to the council of his will.

180
00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:56.925
So that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be

181
00:08:56.925 --> 00:09:00.295
to the praise of His glory in Him.

182
00:09:00.355 --> 00:09:03.215
You also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel

183
00:09:03.315 --> 00:09:06.775
of your salvation and believed in him were sealed

184
00:09:06.775 --> 00:09:10.135
with the promised Holy Spirit who is the guarantee

185
00:09:10.515 --> 00:09:13.975
of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it

186
00:09:14.395 --> 00:09:16.455
to the praise of His glory.

187
00:09:18.435 --> 00:09:23.245
God, thank you for your word, this beautiful picture

188
00:09:23.385 --> 00:09:27.685
of and reminder of the gospel of our salvation.

189
00:09:27.865 --> 00:09:30.565
God, I pray even as difficult as some

190
00:09:30.565 --> 00:09:33.205
of these things might be, I pray you give us

191
00:09:34.105 --> 00:09:37.725
in our hearts good soil to be receiving the word

192
00:09:38.025 --> 00:09:40.125
and bearing good fruit from the word

193
00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:45.185
I pray you would remove any barriers in our minds,

194
00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:48.305
the clutter of the weak that could easily trip us up today.

195
00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:52.865
I pray you strip that away, that we can just see you

196
00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:54.065
and focus on you today.

197
00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:58.045
And your word protect us from the enemy who wants to

198
00:09:59.285 --> 00:10:01.945
snatch away what you're planting in us.

199
00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:06.165
So God help us, protect us, teach us Holy Spirit.

200
00:10:06.865 --> 00:10:08.685
In Jesus' name. Amen.

201
00:10:11.285 --> 00:10:14.215
Okay, so how could we summarize the entire passage

202
00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:16.375
that I just read with one sentence

203
00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:19.575
and could that sentence be a limited

204
00:10:19.795 --> 00:10:22.575
but helpful summary of reformed theology?

205
00:10:22.645 --> 00:10:23.735
Well, here's an effort.

206
00:10:23.735 --> 00:10:24.735
It's not the only one,

207
00:10:24.735 --> 00:10:26.895
it may not be perfectly right either, but it's an effort.

208
00:10:27.885 --> 00:10:29.535
This is what we're gonna work from today, is

209
00:10:29.535 --> 00:10:31.495
that salvation is God's work alone.

210
00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:35.625
Salvation is God's work alone.

211
00:10:37.305 --> 00:10:40.125
It's all over this passage right now.

212
00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:42.765
The genesis of that phrase is actually from the 15 hundreds

213
00:10:42.765 --> 00:10:44.885
and what we call the Protestant Reformation.

214
00:10:46.065 --> 00:10:47.455
And what had happened at the time is

215
00:10:47.455 --> 00:10:50.815
that the Roman Catholic Church had drifted so much into

216
00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:55.455
salvation by works that there was group of a group of people

217
00:10:55.475 --> 00:10:57.575
who started to read the Bible in their own language

218
00:10:57.575 --> 00:10:59.615
and they started seeing things that that didn't match.

219
00:10:59.955 --> 00:11:03.295
And so they felt a need to reform the church.

220
00:11:05.065 --> 00:11:07.805
And so they began working and teaching and writing and

221
00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:12.185
and opposing in many ways in a helpful way that

222
00:11:12.185 --> 00:11:14.585
that was summarized and their, their beliefs of

223
00:11:14.605 --> 00:11:17.225
how they opposed it was summarized

224
00:11:17.225 --> 00:11:19.385
and what we we know as the five solas.

225
00:11:20.085 --> 00:11:23.345
Now the word sola is a Latin word meaning only or alone.

226
00:11:23.965 --> 00:11:25.465
And so they, they summarized it.

227
00:11:25.465 --> 00:11:26.665
And this is some way we've kind

228
00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:28.185
of systematized it in our day as well.

229
00:11:28.485 --> 00:11:30.545
But let me just read these five to you,

230
00:11:30.615 --> 00:11:33.665
that they summarize their beliefs, scripture alone,

231
00:11:34.245 --> 00:11:38.105
Christ alone, faith alone, grace alone

232
00:11:38.685 --> 00:11:40.665
to the glory of God alone.

233
00:11:42.155 --> 00:11:43.935
If you wanted to have a, just a simple summary,

234
00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:46.015
it doesn't say everything, but it says enough of

235
00:11:46.015 --> 00:11:47.855
what they believed in opposition to

236
00:11:47.935 --> 00:11:49.975
what was happening in the Roman Catholic Church.

237
00:11:49.995 --> 00:11:52.775
And so that means that God's word is the final authority,

238
00:11:52.835 --> 00:11:54.485
not the church, they're reading the Bible.

239
00:11:54.635 --> 00:11:57.045
It's what was driving everything.

240
00:11:57.145 --> 00:12:01.125
And what they saw was that salvation is by grace alone

241
00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:05.855
through faith alone in Christ alone, all

242
00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:07.175
for the glory of God alone.

243
00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:09.655
So that's what they wanted to make sure

244
00:12:10.165 --> 00:12:11.415
that they saw from the Bible,

245
00:12:11.495 --> 00:12:13.135
that they were communicating out against

246
00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:14.695
what they had been hearing.

247
00:12:16.065 --> 00:12:18.045
And again, we saw that here in Ephesians one, right?

248
00:12:18.745 --> 00:12:21.805
We saw God accomplishing salvation.

249
00:12:23.705 --> 00:12:26.125
I'm gonna break this whole passage down into three sections.

250
00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:29.825
The first section is this, that we, we learned here

251
00:12:31.765 --> 00:12:33.545
how God accomplished salvation is the

252
00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:34.785
Father chose his people.

253
00:12:35.995 --> 00:12:38.145
First thing we learned about this, how God did it.

254
00:12:38.165 --> 00:12:40.025
He chose his people.

255
00:12:42.005 --> 00:12:44.775
There's no way around this that in verse four,

256
00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:47.575
God chose those who are now believers.

257
00:12:47.585 --> 00:12:49.775
Verse five, he predestined us,

258
00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:52.415
which basically means he chose the end state ahead of time.

259
00:12:54.115 --> 00:12:55.455
And listen, I say that

260
00:12:55.515 --> 00:13:00.095
and I even as I wrote it down as I say it right now, I too,

261
00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:01.415
I know some of you struggling with that.

262
00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:03.655
I too can struggle with the implications of that.

263
00:13:04.795 --> 00:13:06.285
Like I get it. I, I feel it.

264
00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:10.285
But the truth of the matter is

265
00:13:10.285 --> 00:13:12.285
that there was no other way any

266
00:13:12.285 --> 00:13:15.405
of us would have been saved except for God doing this.

267
00:13:17.525 --> 00:13:21.095
Because the effect of sin is not just that we kind

268
00:13:21.095 --> 00:13:25.535
of miss the mark, the effect of sin is so comprehensive

269
00:13:26.925 --> 00:13:31.375
that none of us could initiate a saving response to God.

270
00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:38.125
It was an unconditional act of grace for him to save anyone.

271
00:13:39.395 --> 00:13:41.215
He didn't have to and none

272
00:13:41.215 --> 00:13:42.895
of us could have made it ourselves.

273
00:13:43.035 --> 00:13:46.655
And yet he did as an act of His grace.

274
00:13:48.915 --> 00:13:50.855
But, but here's one of the misunderstandings of this.

275
00:13:50.855 --> 00:13:54.255
Don't think that God in eternity past just merely looked

276
00:13:54.385 --> 00:13:57.055
ahead and saw who would eventually choose him

277
00:13:57.475 --> 00:13:58.775
so then he would choose them.

278
00:14:00.635 --> 00:14:02.735
No. Because in some way if that's true,

279
00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:05.615
then we're compelling God to choose us

280
00:14:05.715 --> 00:14:06.735
by something we've done.

281
00:14:06.795 --> 00:14:09.135
No, that is not how this works.

282
00:14:09.395 --> 00:14:14.085
God saves merely by his own will,

283
00:14:14.715 --> 00:14:16.485
sovereign will for his own reasons.

284
00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:20.475
And that is what this scripture teaches.

285
00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.555
Now, even Calvin himself

286
00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:25.645
kinda wrestled with this a little bit.

287
00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:30.015
This is what he said. Although we cannot conceive either

288
00:14:30.075 --> 00:14:33.735
by argument or reason how God has elected us

289
00:14:34.035 --> 00:14:35.535
before the creation of the world.

290
00:14:36.395 --> 00:14:38.495
We know it by his declaring it to us.

291
00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:41.425
Like we don't know how this works.

292
00:14:41.745 --> 00:14:45.295
I really can't explain it fully, but we know it

293
00:14:45.295 --> 00:14:48.295
because God told us and that's enough.

294
00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:51.940
Now we should seek to understand it and we will.

295
00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:55.525
But that's enough that God chose his people.

296
00:14:55.545 --> 00:14:57.005
But don't get stuck on that too long

297
00:14:57.595 --> 00:15:00.765
because there's reasons why God did this.

298
00:15:01.645 --> 00:15:03.785
We need to see what he cho chose his people for.

299
00:15:03.805 --> 00:15:04.945
And we see it in verse five.

300
00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:09.505
He said it was for adoption to himself as sons of

301
00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:10.705
through Jesus Christ.

302
00:15:11.045 --> 00:15:13.305
So he chose for adoption.

303
00:15:15.275 --> 00:15:17.415
Now why does it not say sons

304
00:15:17.415 --> 00:15:20.745
and daughters like, is salvation only for men?

305
00:15:20.745 --> 00:15:22.825
Is that, is that what he's saying here?

306
00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:24.545
No, he's actually elevating women

307
00:15:24.545 --> 00:15:27.665
because the inheritance idea throughout this passage was

308
00:15:27.665 --> 00:15:29.425
talking about the sons

309
00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:32.945
of the family splitting up all the stuff he's saying.

310
00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:36.185
Now all believers split up God's stuff in a sense.

311
00:15:36.855 --> 00:15:38.425
They receive the inheritance.

312
00:15:38.525 --> 00:15:39.625
So both men

313
00:15:39.645 --> 00:15:43.265
and women who are saved are included in that elevate.

314
00:15:43.265 --> 00:15:45.985
Praise God because that's true.

315
00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:48.065
So the fact that God adopts all of us

316
00:15:48.245 --> 00:15:50.305
as sons is important here.

317
00:15:51.865 --> 00:15:55.865
'cause that means we all get it And don't miss something He,

318
00:15:55.865 --> 00:15:57.585
he said it was done in love, right?

319
00:15:57.585 --> 00:16:00.545
Those couple words right before verse five, he says in love.

320
00:16:02.365 --> 00:16:03.985
So build this image in your head with me for a minute.

321
00:16:03.985 --> 00:16:07.585
Take a take a ride in your brain to somewhere right now

322
00:16:07.585 --> 00:16:09.185
that you, you are an orphan

323
00:16:10.815 --> 00:16:13.035
and you're in the worst orphanage you can ever imagine.

324
00:16:14.175 --> 00:16:15.675
And you're picturing that in your head and

325
00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:17.835
and so you're sitting there and you feel hopeless,

326
00:16:19.585 --> 00:16:21.445
you feel forgotten.

327
00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:27.905
You feel like there's no future. Yet the

328
00:16:27.905 --> 00:16:31.615
wealthiest family in the world walks in the front door,

329
00:16:32.855 --> 00:16:36.955
looks at you and says, I choose you because I love you.

330
00:16:41.255 --> 00:16:43.555
Can can you feel like the joy you would

331
00:16:43.555 --> 00:16:44.875
experience in that moment?

332
00:16:45.815 --> 00:16:48.235
You can't even conceive of everything that involves yet.

333
00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:52.235
But you know, like I'm, I'm, I'm free.

334
00:16:52.655 --> 00:16:54.515
I'm out. I'm a part of a family.

335
00:16:54.705 --> 00:16:58.115
Look at, look at all like you can see the joy

336
00:16:58.145 --> 00:17:01.435
that would come as a result of feeling that that's

337
00:17:01.435 --> 00:17:03.035
what God has done for you.

338
00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:06.975
Believer infinitely more than even

339
00:17:06.975 --> 00:17:08.975
what the wealthiest family on earth can provide

340
00:17:08.975 --> 00:17:10.255
for you infinitely more.

341
00:17:10.275 --> 00:17:11.655
He says, blessed us

342
00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:14.535
with spiritual blessings in the heavenly places in Christ.

343
00:17:14.595 --> 00:17:15.695
That's so much more.

344
00:17:17.055 --> 00:17:21.345
It's what he's done by adopting you into his family.

345
00:17:25.065 --> 00:17:27.995
Not because of your works. Like you can't earn

346
00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:29.955
adoption by works, right?

347
00:17:31.105 --> 00:17:34.275
It's not because of your works. It's because he loves you.

348
00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:36.515
One John three, one, see what kind

349
00:17:36.515 --> 00:17:38.195
of love the father has given to us

350
00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:40.555
that we should be called children of God.

351
00:17:41.175 --> 00:17:43.355
And so we are, this is love.

352
00:17:45.445 --> 00:17:46.905
So he chose for adoption,

353
00:17:46.905 --> 00:17:48.505
but there was a second reason God chose.

354
00:17:48.645 --> 00:17:50.085
We saw, saw the universe. Four.

355
00:17:50.865 --> 00:17:54.285
He says that we should be holy and blameless before him.

356
00:17:55.675 --> 00:18:00.385
He chose his people for holiness as well,

357
00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:03.595
for adoption and for holiness.

358
00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:06.035
Now he's not saying just so we would live holy lives,

359
00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:10.955
he's saying that he would make us where we could stand

360
00:18:11.135 --> 00:18:13.875
before him spiritually blameless.

361
00:18:15.815 --> 00:18:17.575
'cause here's the reality on our own, you

362
00:18:17.575 --> 00:18:20.535
and me, every one of us on our own, we are

363
00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:22.535
absolutely guilty before God.

364
00:18:22.595 --> 00:18:27.335
We are radically corrupted by our sin, unable

365
00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:30.135
to clean ourselves up and left to ourselves.

366
00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:31.535
None of us would choose God.

367
00:18:34.075 --> 00:18:35.445
None of us would move toward God.

368
00:18:35.505 --> 00:18:38.485
Romans three says, none is righteous. No not one.

369
00:18:38.825 --> 00:18:42.165
No one understands. No one seeks for God.

370
00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.485
This is the reality of every one of us,

371
00:18:45.575 --> 00:18:48.285
apart from any intervention by God, we're heading

372
00:18:48.635 --> 00:18:50.605
that way, separated forever.

373
00:18:52.345 --> 00:18:57.245
Yet, yet, God reached into our lives

374
00:18:57.785 --> 00:19:01.845
and through Christ's atonement on the cross, he takes us out

375
00:19:01.845 --> 00:19:05.685
of that and sets us apart as righteous spiritually.

376
00:19:05.715 --> 00:19:07.965
That we are now washed, clean.

377
00:19:10.695 --> 00:19:13.515
Like you know the song, sing it with me.

378
00:19:13.515 --> 00:19:17.995
So don't sing by myself. Jesus paid it all.

379
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:21.155
All to him.

380
00:19:21.715 --> 00:19:25.755
I owe sin had left

381
00:19:26.075 --> 00:19:27.835
a and stain.

382
00:19:28.775 --> 00:19:32.515
He washed it wide as snow.

383
00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:38.395
So I know it's hard at times to understand

384
00:19:38.495 --> 00:19:39.675
how this all works out,

385
00:19:39.695 --> 00:19:42.075
but God choosing his people in the end is

386
00:19:42.155 --> 00:19:43.235
a good thing, right?

387
00:19:44.665 --> 00:19:49.165
For adoption, for holiness to make us right before him.

388
00:19:52.135 --> 00:19:54.315
So that's the first section of this passage.

389
00:19:56.315 --> 00:19:58.335
The Father did something else though here in the second

390
00:19:58.335 --> 00:20:02.575
section that he set forth his son is the way it says it.

391
00:20:03.675 --> 00:20:07.015
He chose his people. He set forth his son.

392
00:20:10.495 --> 00:20:13.555
Look at verse seven. What are the first two words

393
00:20:13.555 --> 00:20:14.595
that we have in English here?

394
00:20:14.595 --> 00:20:18.675
The first two words of verse seven. What does it say in him?

395
00:20:19.975 --> 00:20:22.275
Now there's a lot of the word him throughout this passage.

396
00:20:22.335 --> 00:20:23.915
So the question is, who's who's he talking about?

397
00:20:23.915 --> 00:20:25.555
Which hym is he talking about?

398
00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:30.125
Well, right in verse six, in the beloved who's the beloved?

399
00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:32.405
Well that's, that's the son of God.

400
00:20:32.945 --> 00:20:34.525
The means of God's grace

401
00:20:34.705 --> 00:20:39.405
to us in a way is the Son the beloved in him.

402
00:20:40.855 --> 00:20:44.555
The Father set forth this purpose of redemption.

403
00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:50.135
He he set forth the Son in the flesh for redemption.

404
00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:54.335
We see it here through this God

405
00:20:54.425 --> 00:20:55.615
man's perfect blood.

406
00:20:56.475 --> 00:21:00.385
We get forgiveness. His death gave

407
00:21:00.485 --> 00:21:01.625
us something.

408
00:21:03.665 --> 00:21:07.285
He purposely atoned for the sin of all of those

409
00:21:07.285 --> 00:21:11.845
who verse 12 says, would hope in Christ that faith,

410
00:21:12.225 --> 00:21:14.925
the belief that verse 14 talked about, that we believe

411
00:21:14.945 --> 00:21:17.285
that's how his death counts for ours.

412
00:21:17.285 --> 00:21:18.885
It's not just universally applied

413
00:21:20.435 --> 00:21:21.435
'cause then everybody would be saved.

414
00:21:21.535 --> 00:21:23.875
No, he's saying those who hope in Christ.

415
00:21:23.895 --> 00:21:26.115
And so it's not just about being a good person,

416
00:21:28.795 --> 00:21:31.005
it's not just about being around church all the time.

417
00:21:32.865 --> 00:21:35.355
It's not even that your parents are Christians

418
00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:36.875
and so they bring you to church all the time

419
00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:37.955
and you just kind of assume

420
00:21:38.055 --> 00:21:39.715
by default you're a Christian too.

421
00:21:41.285 --> 00:21:44.655
No, that's not how this thing works.

422
00:21:45.965 --> 00:21:49.335
This word redemption illustrates the idea that you

423
00:21:49.355 --> 00:21:52.495
and I are slaves that need to be bought back.

424
00:21:55.015 --> 00:21:56.235
We need to be redeemed.

425
00:21:56.855 --> 00:21:58.635
And the only sufficient payment

426
00:21:59.175 --> 00:22:01.395
to redeem us was the blood of Christ.

427
00:22:03.835 --> 00:22:05.135
So he set forth his son

428
00:22:05.275 --> 00:22:09.275
for redemption, but that wasn't it.

429
00:22:10.445 --> 00:22:12.985
The Father also set forth his son for restoration.

430
00:22:13.045 --> 00:22:17.375
It says for redemption, but also for restoration.

431
00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:18.855
Verse 10 says,

432
00:22:18.855 --> 00:22:22.015
Christ will unite all things in him heaven and on earth.

433
00:22:22.035 --> 00:22:23.575
That's restoration language.

434
00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:27.215
The fracturing that we experience every day will not

435
00:22:27.315 --> 00:22:28.615
always be the way it is.

436
00:22:31.565 --> 00:22:33.105
All this that's broken and divided

437
00:22:33.205 --> 00:22:36.465
and separated will one day be restored in Jesus,

438
00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:38.905
which in fact is what he's even doing right now.

439
00:22:41.055 --> 00:22:43.595
Why do you think the New Testament letters over

440
00:22:43.655 --> 00:22:45.515
and over again talk about unity?

441
00:22:47.615 --> 00:22:50.305
Because the unity of his people in the church

442
00:22:50.845 --> 00:22:55.225
is an illustration, a foretaste of the glory that's coming,

443
00:22:57.505 --> 00:23:00.595
that this is an example of something that will be fully

444
00:23:00.615 --> 00:23:04.075
and finally done one day in his presence forever.

445
00:23:04.215 --> 00:23:07.715
The future kingdoms breaking in through his people,

446
00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:10.125
restoring us.

447
00:23:13.865 --> 00:23:15.555
There's actually a third reason the father

448
00:23:15.735 --> 00:23:16.995
set forth his son.

449
00:23:18.345 --> 00:23:23.295
It's for possession, so for redemption, for restoration,

450
00:23:23.595 --> 00:23:24.775
and for possession.

451
00:23:28.175 --> 00:23:30.305
Look carefully at verse 11 again.

452
00:23:31.575 --> 00:23:34.395
The way it reads in English is in him we've obtained an

453
00:23:34.395 --> 00:23:38.435
inheritance that seems like at first glance we

454
00:23:38.635 --> 00:23:39.795
receive the inheritance.

455
00:23:40.105 --> 00:23:42.635
Well in verse 14 we do.

456
00:23:44.105 --> 00:23:47.145
But in the original language, this actually talks about

457
00:23:47.245 --> 00:23:49.625
how we are made an inheritance.

458
00:23:51.985 --> 00:23:55.365
In other words, we become the possession of God

459
00:23:56.165 --> 00:23:58.855
through his predestining purpose and will.

460
00:23:59.475 --> 00:24:03.785
It means that we are his both now and forever.

461
00:24:07.275 --> 00:24:09.255
We are made into that.

462
00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:13.945
Now we've come a long way already

463
00:24:14.565 --> 00:24:15.985
and all that's a lot I know,

464
00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:18.675
but we're actually not finished yet.

465
00:24:18.675 --> 00:24:21.995
There's more here. Verses 13

466
00:24:21.995 --> 00:24:25.355
and 14, show us why the Father sent his spirit as well.

467
00:24:27.025 --> 00:24:28.165
So the father chose his people.

468
00:24:28.185 --> 00:24:31.165
The father then set forth his son,

469
00:24:31.185 --> 00:24:33.045
but then he also sent his spirit.

470
00:24:34.385 --> 00:24:37.445
We see it in verses 13 and 14, God accomplishing salvation.

471
00:24:37.445 --> 00:24:41.035
Look at this piece, verse 13 in

472
00:24:41.055 --> 00:24:42.635
him, that's in Christ.

473
00:24:42.855 --> 00:24:45.955
You also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel,

474
00:24:45.955 --> 00:24:49.555
your salvation believed in him, were sealed

475
00:24:49.675 --> 00:24:52.915
with the promised Holy Spirit who is the guarantee

476
00:24:52.935 --> 00:24:56.515
of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it

477
00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:58.875
to the praise of his glory.

478
00:25:00.755 --> 00:25:03.965
So why'd the Father send his spirit first

479
00:25:04.425 --> 00:25:08.295
to seal the promise that was clear, right?

480
00:25:08.295 --> 00:25:11.135
It's what it said to seal the promise.

481
00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.015
Jesus said it. The Old Testament said it.

482
00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:16.975
This is what was coming in salvation.

483
00:25:17.035 --> 00:25:19.055
The Holy Spirit was coming to his people.

484
00:25:19.165 --> 00:25:22.255
What happens when someone trusts in Christ, when they repent

485
00:25:22.515 --> 00:25:24.815
and believe, when they hope in Christ as this scr,

486
00:25:24.845 --> 00:25:29.575
this said, the Lord sends his Holy Spirit into that person

487
00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:31.255
to seal you.

488
00:25:32.885 --> 00:25:34.865
Now that word seal is like when you think

489
00:25:34.865 --> 00:25:38.925
of a brand on a horse, what does that illustrate?

490
00:25:39.795 --> 00:25:41.125
What does the brand mean?

491
00:25:41.275 --> 00:25:43.965
When a horse has a brand, it means ownership, right?

492
00:25:45.165 --> 00:25:47.055
It's who possesses that horse.

493
00:25:49.135 --> 00:25:53.475
The Holy Spirit sealing us, branding us, marking us,

494
00:25:54.185 --> 00:25:57.355
says, God says, you are mine.

495
00:26:00.185 --> 00:26:04.925
We're marked sealed. God says, that's mine. You are mine.

496
00:26:06.645 --> 00:26:08.995
Which is why verse 14 says, the Holy Spirit is sent

497
00:26:08.995 --> 00:26:12.185
to guarantee our eternity, right?

498
00:26:12.185 --> 00:26:13.185
So it seals the promise.

499
00:26:13.725 --> 00:26:15.865
God says, you're mine covenant promise,

500
00:26:15.965 --> 00:26:18.185
but then also it guarantees our eternity

501
00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:21.295
we're already owned.

502
00:26:21.835 --> 00:26:24.215
And if you are his, you're his forever.

503
00:26:26.505 --> 00:26:30.245
The Holy Spirit guarantees he never backs out of

504
00:26:30.245 --> 00:26:31.565
that covenant.

505
00:26:33.965 --> 00:26:35.535
It's the word guarantee here.

506
00:26:35.835 --> 00:26:38.415
The word in the original language is like when you put a

507
00:26:38.415 --> 00:26:41.055
down payment down on a house, right?

508
00:26:41.055 --> 00:26:42.935
You put some money down, a lot of money down

509
00:26:43.305 --> 00:26:45.885
and you say, Hey, I'm promising to pay the rest

510
00:26:45.885 --> 00:26:47.085
of it over time, right?

511
00:26:49.535 --> 00:26:51.195
But don't push that metaphor too far

512
00:26:51.665 --> 00:26:53.235
because here's the reality, you

513
00:26:53.235 --> 00:26:55.355
and I, when we put money down on something

514
00:26:55.355 --> 00:26:56.875
to pay the promise later, we

515
00:26:56.875 --> 00:26:57.955
can back outta that deal, can't we?

516
00:26:58.655 --> 00:27:03.615
But God can't, he never changes.

517
00:27:04.855 --> 00:27:07.305
He's good on his promise. So when he says,

518
00:27:07.405 --> 00:27:09.905
notice when he says the down payment

519
00:27:10.205 --> 00:27:12.225
of your eternity is the Holy Spirit in you,

520
00:27:12.495 --> 00:27:13.945
he's good on paying the rest.

521
00:27:14.925 --> 00:27:17.975
That inheritance is good for us for eternity.

522
00:27:17.975 --> 00:27:19.895
He's promised it, he's guaranteed it

523
00:27:19.995 --> 00:27:21.095
and he's going to give it.

524
00:27:23.575 --> 00:27:27.835
That's why someone who is truly saved will persevere

525
00:27:29.865 --> 00:27:31.845
if the Holy Spirit is in that person

526
00:27:31.985 --> 00:27:34.245
as the guarantee of eternity.

527
00:27:34.505 --> 00:27:37.725
If he truly owns that person, then

528
00:27:37.725 --> 00:27:39.165
that promised future's guarantee.

529
00:27:40.445 --> 00:27:42.425
It might be a meandering road to get there,

530
00:27:42.765 --> 00:27:44.385
but it's guaranteed.

531
00:27:48.305 --> 00:27:49.925
So again, let's go back to the top on this.

532
00:27:50.065 --> 00:27:51.525
As we saw at the beginning

533
00:27:51.985 --> 00:27:53.925
and all throughout Ephesians one,

534
00:27:54.525 --> 00:27:56.485
salvation is God's work alone.

535
00:27:58.205 --> 00:28:02.125
This is what God does. He chose his people.

536
00:28:02.145 --> 00:28:05.125
He set forth the redeemer not just to offer salvation,

537
00:28:05.125 --> 00:28:06.805
but to actually accomplish salvation.

538
00:28:08.065 --> 00:28:11.645
And God sent his spirit to ensure that it is completed.

539
00:28:13.975 --> 00:28:17.415
Now, notice something. Everything I just said

540
00:28:18.235 --> 00:28:19.855
is not something I'm saying just

541
00:28:19.855 --> 00:28:23.875
because it's in some systematic theology textbook or

542
00:28:23.875 --> 00:28:25.595
because we read it in an article online

543
00:28:25.865 --> 00:28:27.035
that somebody came up with.

544
00:28:28.225 --> 00:28:31.985
This is what God's word says. It's right here.

545
00:28:32.135 --> 00:28:33.745
It's direct from it.

546
00:28:36.095 --> 00:28:40.285
Now, I know some of you're thinking

547
00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:42.085
of tensions that that comes up.

548
00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:43.725
You'd think of other scriptures, you're thinking about

549
00:28:43.725 --> 00:28:45.365
what about this, but what about that?

550
00:28:45.385 --> 00:28:47.645
And there are tensions that inevitably arise.

551
00:28:47.695 --> 00:28:49.085
We're gonna try to deal with some

552
00:28:49.085 --> 00:28:50.525
of those on Wednesday night a little bit

553
00:28:50.745 --> 00:28:51.965
in our digging, deeper time.

554
00:28:53.225 --> 00:28:56.785
But here's the point. The point of this

555
00:28:58.175 --> 00:28:59.715
is that we start with God.

556
00:29:01.795 --> 00:29:05.285
What I mean by that is our theological framework has

557
00:29:05.345 --> 00:29:08.605
to start top down like this.

558
00:29:08.715 --> 00:29:10.805
This idea, not, not, don't think convertible, top down,

559
00:29:10.805 --> 00:29:13.605
like driving around on a beautiful day, like top down, up

560
00:29:13.625 --> 00:29:16.605
to down, like top down theology, meaning we start

561
00:29:16.605 --> 00:29:18.205
with God, it's about him.

562
00:29:18.545 --> 00:29:23.045
And then we try to answer the questions that will come from

563
00:29:23.045 --> 00:29:26.675
that rather than starting bottom up, start with us

564
00:29:27.615 --> 00:29:29.445
and then try to answer the questions

565
00:29:29.475 --> 00:29:32.375
that come from there, right?

566
00:29:32.395 --> 00:29:34.095
We have to choose which way we start from.

567
00:29:34.095 --> 00:29:37.375
And so we've chosen to start top down, start with God,

568
00:29:37.395 --> 00:29:39.055
answer the questions in light of that

569
00:29:39.275 --> 00:29:41.550
and wrestle with some of the implications in light of that.

570
00:29:42.735 --> 00:29:44.035
We believe that's the right way

571
00:29:44.615 --> 00:29:46.595
to do theological principles.

572
00:29:49.765 --> 00:29:54.025
Now, everything I've said is absolutely important.

573
00:29:54.845 --> 00:29:57.985
As we've seen in scripture in many ways, I just kind

574
00:29:57.985 --> 00:29:59.185
of skimmed the top of this thing

575
00:29:59.205 --> 00:30:01.905
and maybe created more questions than answered any.

576
00:30:04.715 --> 00:30:06.295
But the next question naturally

577
00:30:06.295 --> 00:30:08.515
follows, okay, that's all great.

578
00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:11.555
We've done all that. What do we even do with all this?

579
00:30:13.865 --> 00:30:17.035
Like how do we respond to that?

580
00:30:19.245 --> 00:30:20.275
Right? Because that's the question.

581
00:30:20.275 --> 00:30:21.155
We can have all these, these

582
00:30:21.305 --> 00:30:22.835
beautiful theological principles.

583
00:30:22.835 --> 00:30:25.925
The questions, what do we do with that? This is hard.

584
00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:28.885
What do we do with it? Well, here's I pick three.

585
00:30:28.885 --> 00:30:32.995
There's probably way more. Here's, here's the first one.

586
00:30:35.995 --> 00:30:39.285
When we honestly look at everything

587
00:30:39.975 --> 00:30:42.845
right here in Ephesians one, the implications, the ideas,

588
00:30:43.185 --> 00:30:46.525
we look at the truth of saving his people.

589
00:30:46.625 --> 00:30:49.285
We look honestly at those things.

590
00:30:49.665 --> 00:30:51.845
It should create humility.

591
00:30:54.625 --> 00:30:58.205
We lay down this text in front of us.

592
00:30:58.785 --> 00:31:03.205
It should create in us a humble heart, right?

593
00:31:06.075 --> 00:31:08.675
I mean, we deserve none of it,

594
00:31:10.365 --> 00:31:11.505
and yet God did it.

595
00:31:13.435 --> 00:31:14.645
There's no way we could earn this.

596
00:31:14.645 --> 00:31:17.045
There's nothing we could do yet God did it.

597
00:31:17.065 --> 00:31:19.525
We should never be arrogant about these truths.

598
00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:24.305
We should never be antagonistic about these truths.

599
00:31:24.305 --> 00:31:26.385
We should never walk around kind of self righteously,

600
00:31:26.705 --> 00:31:28.105
smug about these truths

601
00:31:30.725 --> 00:31:33.175
because the idea of undeserved grace

602
00:31:34.805 --> 00:31:37.025
should drive us to our faces.

603
00:31:38.565 --> 00:31:43.225
Bowing before this great God, never thinking that,

604
00:31:43.335 --> 00:31:45.265
that somehow we're better than anybody else.

605
00:31:45.405 --> 00:31:47.225
The ground is level at the foot of the cross.

606
00:31:47.445 --> 00:31:50.785
And so we come to him there by his grace.

607
00:31:54.675 --> 00:31:57.935
One of the markers of our church should be a true deep

608
00:31:58.655 --> 00:32:03.185
humility where we walk around

609
00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:06.855
almost dumbfounded

610
00:32:07.285 --> 00:32:10.815
that God would even include us in this thing, right?

611
00:32:10.845 --> 00:32:13.055
Like, I deserve hell.

612
00:32:13.535 --> 00:32:15.855
I deserve separation, I deserve wrath.

613
00:32:16.315 --> 00:32:18.375
And yet he chose to save me.

614
00:32:18.485 --> 00:32:21.975
Like, and we're just dumbfounded as we walk around, just

615
00:32:22.115 --> 00:32:24.655
so grateful for what God has done.

616
00:32:27.825 --> 00:32:28.925
It should create humility.

617
00:32:31.075 --> 00:32:33.455
The second is, should cultivate mission,

618
00:32:35.815 --> 00:32:38.685
these truths should cultivate mission.

619
00:32:41.865 --> 00:32:42.825
I know right now some of you're

620
00:32:42.825 --> 00:32:43.585
wondering how that even works.

621
00:32:44.425 --> 00:32:45.595
Like, wait a second, I thought,

622
00:32:46.155 --> 00:32:48.275
I thought these beliefs meant that were not supposed

623
00:32:48.275 --> 00:32:51.275
to be missional, salvation's, all of God.

624
00:32:51.335 --> 00:32:53.315
So what? Why do we even need to do anything?

625
00:32:56.145 --> 00:32:57.435
What salvation is of God?

626
00:32:59.845 --> 00:33:04.485
But the means that he has ordained salvation to come,

627
00:33:05.185 --> 00:33:08.325
the gospel to come is by using people like you

628
00:33:08.325 --> 00:33:12.815
and me to proclaim it to other people, right?

629
00:33:13.295 --> 00:33:16.775
Sandwiched in the middle of Romans nine through 11,

630
00:33:16.775 --> 00:33:20.135
which is like the preeminent election text in the middle

631
00:33:20.135 --> 00:33:22.975
of it, in Romans 10, he says directly,

632
00:33:23.115 --> 00:33:24.535
how can they believe unless they hear?

633
00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:30.215
So the idea for us, we saw even here in Ephesians one,

634
00:33:30.765 --> 00:33:32.255
when you heard the word of truth

635
00:33:32.635 --> 00:33:35.455
and believed in that gospel of your salvation.

636
00:33:35.455 --> 00:33:37.575
So there's a measure of this is how you

637
00:33:37.595 --> 00:33:40.935
and I are, how God gets the gospel to people.

638
00:33:43.795 --> 00:33:44.895
But here's what else it does.

639
00:33:46.145 --> 00:33:47.675
This idea of election, this idea

640
00:33:47.695 --> 00:33:50.755
of God's effective call should also give us a healthy

641
00:33:50.845 --> 00:33:52.475
confidence as we go.

642
00:33:54.215 --> 00:33:56.865
Because what that means is there's no pressure on

643
00:33:56.865 --> 00:33:57.905
me or you anymore.

644
00:33:57.925 --> 00:34:01.925
In the mission of God, it's up to God to save, right?

645
00:34:03.155 --> 00:34:06.165
That takes the pressure off of me, takes the pressure off

646
00:34:06.165 --> 00:34:08.965
of you that all he's calling us to do is scatter the seed.

647
00:34:09.835 --> 00:34:12.605
He's calling us to be these farmers out there tossing seed

648
00:34:12.615 --> 00:34:13.965
everywhere and anywhere.

649
00:34:14.025 --> 00:34:16.005
Now we can get better at doing that, yes.

650
00:34:16.385 --> 00:34:19.765
But our job is to sow the seed of the gospel broadly

651
00:34:20.105 --> 00:34:21.285
and let God do his work.

652
00:34:24.525 --> 00:34:27.945
Yet when we go, when we scatter that gospel to all nations,

653
00:34:28.045 --> 00:34:29.625
we scatter it to all people we meet.

654
00:34:29.625 --> 00:34:31.785
We're not supposed to be discriminate about how we

655
00:34:32.245 --> 00:34:33.825
who we choose to give it to, right?

656
00:34:33.955 --> 00:34:36.465
We're to call all to repent and believe.

657
00:34:36.465 --> 00:34:39.465
When we do that, because of these truths right here,

658
00:34:39.685 --> 00:34:42.505
we can be sure that some will be saved.

659
00:34:44.815 --> 00:34:47.235
And listen, it has nothing to do with

660
00:34:47.235 --> 00:34:49.395
how persuasive I am as I share the gospel.

661
00:34:51.695 --> 00:34:53.235
It has nothing to do with how bold I

662
00:34:53.235 --> 00:34:54.435
am as I share the gospel.

663
00:34:54.535 --> 00:34:57.355
It has nothing to do with us playing five verses of just

664
00:34:57.415 --> 00:34:59.475
as I am to break someone down emotionally

665
00:34:59.475 --> 00:35:00.515
enough that they finally come.

666
00:35:02.825 --> 00:35:07.745
No, salvation is God's work.

667
00:35:09.425 --> 00:35:13.765
So he'll save. We sow the gospel

668
00:35:14.035 --> 00:35:15.365
seed in confidence.

669
00:35:15.485 --> 00:35:18.125
I preach up here every week or every somebody else preaches.

670
00:35:18.125 --> 00:35:20.645
Every week you talk to your neighbor every day,

671
00:35:20.645 --> 00:35:23.645
potentially you pray for your family every moment, right?

672
00:35:23.645 --> 00:35:25.725
You're praying that God would do his work.

673
00:35:25.725 --> 00:35:27.005
And we do that in confidence

674
00:35:27.005 --> 00:35:29.205
because we know God will save some

675
00:35:30.865 --> 00:35:32.835
even from the hardest places.

676
00:35:35.055 --> 00:35:37.445
Remember, revelation five, all nations,

677
00:35:37.865 --> 00:35:39.685
all people groups are represented there.

678
00:35:39.985 --> 00:35:41.965
So when somebody goes at the risk of their life,

679
00:35:41.965 --> 00:35:43.085
they go in confidence knowing

680
00:35:43.085 --> 00:35:46.755
that God's got some in there, somebody is gonna be saved.

681
00:35:47.795 --> 00:35:48.815
And so we go in

682
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:53.045
confidence as we go on mission.

683
00:35:53.665 --> 00:35:56.675
We should be humble.

684
00:35:58.025 --> 00:36:01.375
Go on mission. But finally, the third one,

685
00:36:03.045 --> 00:36:05.635
these truths should compel praise.

686
00:36:08.555 --> 00:36:10.845
They should compel praise.

687
00:36:15.095 --> 00:36:16.875
As we went through this passage, I didn't tell you

688
00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:20.365
how I broke it up and why, but you saw three sections.

689
00:36:20.365 --> 00:36:23.085
And I want you to see how I got to those three sections.

690
00:36:23.085 --> 00:36:26.845
Look at the, uh, start of verse six, the end of verse 12,

691
00:36:26.905 --> 00:36:27.925
the end of verse 14.

692
00:36:28.775 --> 00:36:30.485
Those are the ends of the section breaks, right?

693
00:36:31.955 --> 00:36:36.295
What does verse six say to the praise of his glorious grace?

694
00:36:38.315 --> 00:36:42.345
Verse 12 ends to the praise of his glory.

695
00:36:43.985 --> 00:36:48.255
Verse 14, the end to the praise of his glory.

696
00:36:50.885 --> 00:36:51.945
Now, when you're reading the Bible

697
00:36:51.965 --> 00:36:53.625
and you see something repeated like that,

698
00:36:53.935 --> 00:36:54.945
that means it's important.

699
00:36:57.165 --> 00:37:00.905
And each section, father, son, spirit, he does end

700
00:37:01.205 --> 00:37:03.185
to the praise of his glory.

701
00:37:03.285 --> 00:37:04.505
So catch what this is telling us.

702
00:37:04.565 --> 00:37:08.405
Now, in all three of these sections, what the Father did

703
00:37:08.425 --> 00:37:11.685
to adopt his people, what he did to set forth his son

704
00:37:11.685 --> 00:37:14.405
to redeem and restore what he did by sending his spirit

705
00:37:14.505 --> 00:37:18.085
to seal and guarantee he did all of that so

706
00:37:18.085 --> 00:37:20.205
that we would praise him even more.

707
00:37:21.545 --> 00:37:24.285
He says, to the praise of his glory, it's

708
00:37:24.285 --> 00:37:25.565
so we would praise.

709
00:37:25.715 --> 00:37:28.085
He's already gracious, he's already glorious.

710
00:37:28.315 --> 00:37:29.605
He's already worthy of praise.

711
00:37:29.785 --> 00:37:31.845
But listen, he receives even more glory

712
00:37:32.145 --> 00:37:33.925
by saving sinners like you and me.

713
00:37:35.625 --> 00:37:38.695
He doesn't have to. And he had

714
00:37:38.695 --> 00:37:40.735
to do everything it took to make it happen.

715
00:37:41.635 --> 00:37:45.215
So he is the one who gets the glory even more through

716
00:37:45.775 --> 00:37:46.815
salvation of sinners.

717
00:37:50.225 --> 00:37:51.915
Like that is glorious, right?

718
00:37:55.205 --> 00:37:57.825
And so let me just talk for a second to, to a few of you

719
00:37:58.095 --> 00:38:02.965
that maybe, maybe right now you're feeling a, a bit

720
00:38:02.965 --> 00:38:04.165
of a stirring in your heart.

721
00:38:08.605 --> 00:38:11.055
That you're, you're realizing that you're a sinner in need

722
00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:15.905
of a savior like this, and you're strangely warming

723
00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:18.065
to these truths.

724
00:38:18.895 --> 00:38:20.885
Maybe it's been a while. Maybe you've been kind of dealing

725
00:38:20.885 --> 00:38:22.365
with this for a couple weeks or months,

726
00:38:22.365 --> 00:38:24.725
and now you're, you're starting to see again and again.

727
00:38:24.725 --> 00:38:26.965
Listen to me, that's not me doing that.

728
00:38:29.805 --> 00:38:32.705
That's not a preacher being persuasive enough

729
00:38:32.705 --> 00:38:34.585
that emotionally you're starting to feel something.

730
00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:37.805
No. That that is the Lord working in you right now.

731
00:38:39.635 --> 00:38:44.055
That's the Lord drawing you to himself right now

732
00:38:46.725 --> 00:38:48.535
because you would not come up with

733
00:38:48.535 --> 00:38:53.385
that on your own in ourselves.

734
00:38:53.635 --> 00:38:56.825
Again, you can't create a desire for God.

735
00:38:57.445 --> 00:38:59.785
And if he's giving you this sense of like, I, I,

736
00:39:00.145 --> 00:39:02.945
I think I want to know more and I wanna know who he is.

737
00:39:03.095 --> 00:39:05.985
That is the Lord at work within you.

738
00:39:06.575 --> 00:39:10.305
It's God's voice that is drawing you to himself.

739
00:39:10.325 --> 00:39:13.505
And so what do you do with that? You respond in hope.

740
00:39:13.855 --> 00:39:16.225
Like Ephesians one said, you believe

741
00:39:17.835 --> 00:39:19.415
the way Jesus said it is you repent

742
00:39:19.555 --> 00:39:20.855
and believe you turn from your sin

743
00:39:20.855 --> 00:39:22.335
and say, okay, that got me in trouble.

744
00:39:22.365 --> 00:39:24.575
That got me condemned forever. Jesus.

745
00:39:24.775 --> 00:39:27.135
I want what you give me. I can't do anything about that.

746
00:39:27.335 --> 00:39:30.485
I need you. And you hope in Christ,

747
00:39:31.725 --> 00:39:33.815
believe the gospel of your salvation

748
00:39:35.675 --> 00:39:38.055
and all of this that he promised he'll give you.

749
00:39:41.825 --> 00:39:44.085
So please, we'd love to talk with you about that afterwards

750
00:39:44.795 --> 00:39:45.845
with somebody you came with.

751
00:39:45.875 --> 00:39:47.685
Talk to them about it. We'd love to hear.

752
00:39:50.655 --> 00:39:51.655
I mean, I talked to somebody

753
00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:54.815
before the first service who told me their story of how

754
00:39:56.415 --> 00:39:59.065
this day they were completely opposed to the gospel.

755
00:39:59.205 --> 00:40:02.145
The very next day they said, no, I love Jesus. I want him.

756
00:40:04.425 --> 00:40:08.525
Where does that come from? Completely opposed.

757
00:40:08.985 --> 00:40:11.205
And he said, the next day I was like, I want

758
00:40:11.205 --> 00:40:13.865
that it's God's work.

759
00:40:15.225 --> 00:40:16.485
It wasn't somebody convincing him,

760
00:40:16.485 --> 00:40:18.125
it wasn't somebody being persuasive enough.

761
00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:20.125
It was God changing his heart.

762
00:40:23.045 --> 00:40:25.445
Powerful. So don't give up praying for somebody, by the way.

763
00:40:28.655 --> 00:40:30.315
But then I also wanna talk to the rest of us,

764
00:40:31.965 --> 00:40:33.115
those who are believers.

765
00:40:35.225 --> 00:40:36.725
Here's what my prayer was all week.

766
00:40:39.575 --> 00:40:42.995
That our hearts by these truths,

767
00:40:43.505 --> 00:40:48.435
that our hearts would be fanned into flame in a new way

768
00:40:48.455 --> 00:40:50.635
by seeing these truths that we may have missed

769
00:40:50.735 --> 00:40:53.395
or may have forgotten, that we would see it.

770
00:40:53.395 --> 00:40:56.755
That, that we would be so stirred in our hearts

771
00:40:57.025 --> 00:40:59.195
that something would trigger to say,

772
00:40:59.735 --> 00:41:02.265
man, God, you're worthy.

773
00:41:03.775 --> 00:41:05.635
And that even just in this room, the roof,

774
00:41:05.815 --> 00:41:07.595
the roof would lift off this place

775
00:41:07.595 --> 00:41:10.995
because we're so passionate about our praise.

776
00:41:11.215 --> 00:41:13.595
But then not only that, we would also walk out of here.

777
00:41:13.775 --> 00:41:15.915
And every day of our lives we would see is

778
00:41:15.915 --> 00:41:17.395
for the praise of His glory.

779
00:41:17.535 --> 00:41:19.795
And we'd live differently for his glory

780
00:41:19.825 --> 00:41:21.115
because of these truths.

781
00:41:22.595 --> 00:41:24.635
'cause this is our God church.

782
00:41:24.935 --> 00:41:27.715
We shouldn't care what other people think about us

783
00:41:27.815 --> 00:41:28.995
as we respond to him

784
00:41:28.995 --> 00:41:32.475
because we're so stunned by the reality that he would choose

785
00:41:32.535 --> 00:41:34.245
to save sinners like us.

786
00:41:35.865 --> 00:41:40.725
That's the point. He's made us different.

787
00:41:41.105 --> 00:41:43.245
Listen, he's holy, he's sovereign.

788
00:41:43.305 --> 00:41:47.565
He doesn't have to save anyone, but he's grace, he's love,

789
00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:49.045
and he's made a way

790
00:41:49.545 --> 00:41:51.845
and blessed us more than we can ever imagine.

791
00:41:52.105 --> 00:41:54.685
That's what compels praise church.

792
00:41:56.425 --> 00:42:00.725
So let's proclaim all that he's done in here,

793
00:42:02.465 --> 00:42:07.005
but out there proclaiming the glory of our savior king.
