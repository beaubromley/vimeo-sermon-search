1
00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.565
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

2
00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.765
of death, I will not fear for you are with me.

3
00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:09.525
You are my light and my salvation.

4
00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.885
You restore me and lead me for your glory.

5
00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:17.045
I long to dwell in your house forever.

6
00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:28.045
Amen. Well, good morning church. You can have a seat.

7
00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.285
So glad to see you all today.

8
00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:33.565
Had a great couple weeks of camps.

9
00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:35.285
Now we're gearing up for the semester.

10
00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:38.965
I'll go ahead and invite you to take your copy of God's Word

11
00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:41.685
and turn with me to Psalm 75.

12
00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:43.845
So what we're gonna be all morning,

13
00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:45.605
I'll explain more here in a moment.

14
00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:47.805
We're continuing our journey, long journey

15
00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:49.525
through the book of Psalms.

16
00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:51.245
And, and you may not be aware of this,

17
00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:56.325
but uh, there are 150 psalms in the

18
00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:57.645
Book of Psalms.

19
00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:01.125
Uh, so kids, let's give a little bit of a math refresher

20
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:02.285
before we get back into school.

21
00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:07.245
Uh, what is half of 157? 5 75.

22
00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:08.725
Okay, good. We're already on track.

23
00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:10.365
Ready to start school again.

24
00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:14.325
And so us being in Psalms 75 today means

25
00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:18.525
we are halfway through the entire book of Psalms.

26
00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:20.845
Halfway dressed up by the way.

27
00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:22.885
So, uh, you can see like it,

28
00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:25.845
it only took us five years to get here.

29
00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:27.605
How about that? Uh, we'll see

30
00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:28.725
how long it takes us to finish.

31
00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:30.685
But here's what we're gonna do today.

32
00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:33.205
So this is something we've seen a number

33
00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:35.325
of times already in various songs

34
00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:38.205
where you look at the heading and it says something like To

35
00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:41.485
the choir master or it says a song.

36
00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:43.085
In fact, this one says both of those things

37
00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:48.245
and it means that even like this one is attributed to ASAP

38
00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:51.205
and his family was the worship leaders at the temple,

39
00:01:51.205 --> 00:01:54.245
leading the people in singing praises to God.

40
00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:55.405
And so you put all that together

41
00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:57.605
and what that means that these psalms were meant

42
00:01:57.605 --> 00:01:59.725
to be sung by.

43
00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:01.965
All right, the choir master a song.

44
00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:04.485
In fact, all of them were really prayers slash

45
00:02:04.495 --> 00:02:05.525
songs that we can sing.

46
00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:08.445
But, but this one specifically and many others say that.

47
00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:12.125
And so that's what we're going to do today.

48
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:13.485
We're not gonna do it with every psalm

49
00:02:13.485 --> 00:02:14.885
that says choir, master or song.

50
00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:16.925
We won't do that all the time. But today

51
00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:19.365
what we're gonna do is we're gonna sing these truths

52
00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:22.685
as we work through the psalm, just as a way

53
00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.325
to practice what they would've done.

54
00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:26.955
I'm gonna teach for a little bit and then we'll sing

55
00:02:27.015 --> 00:02:28.595
and then I'll teach some more and then we'll sing

56
00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:32.035
and it just kinda works through and you'll see it as we go.

57
00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:34.715
And so as we sing, I would invite you

58
00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:37.115
to keep your Bibles open right there at your seat.

59
00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:39.035
Keep your notes out if you take notes and,

60
00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:40.875
and just be ready to go the whole time

61
00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:42.235
'cause we're gonna bounce back and forth.

62
00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:44.955
But also be ready to stand up if you are able and

63
00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:49.555
and praise together and sing these same truths to God.

64
00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:51.955
And you'll again, you'll see what we mean as we go.

65
00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:54.035
I wanna pray first, then we'll get into God's word.

66
00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:56.955
Lord, we thank you for the time we get to

67
00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.435
to be here together today.

68
00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:00.805
We don't take it for granted that we get to be

69
00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:03.045
worshiping you freely.

70
00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:04.405
Uh, we know that many people

71
00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:05.885
around the world don't have that privilege.

72
00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.045
And so we're grateful

73
00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:09.885
and we don't wanna take that lightly or for granted.

74
00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:14.685
So we pray that we can by your spirit's power respond to you

75
00:03:14.705 --> 00:03:18.765
and faith and joy and praise 'cause you're worthy.

76
00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:23.445
Then we would give our lives as a response to all

77
00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:25.045
that you've done and all that you are.

78
00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:28.295
Help us Holy Spirit, open our eyes to see

79
00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:29.375
what you want us to see today.

80
00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:34.455
Understand it, apply it, live it out in Jesus' name. Amen.

81
00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:38.045
I wanna read the 10 verses of Psalm 75.

82
00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:39.885
First get a feel for where we're going

83
00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:41.765
and then we'll come back and work through it.

84
00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:43.965
So Psalm 75, again, the heading is

85
00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:46.725
to the choir master according to do not destroy,

86
00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:50.005
which would've been maybe a melody, a tune, a a way

87
00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:54.405
of singing it, A Psalm of asap, A PS song

88
00:03:55.615 --> 00:03:57.445
verse one, we give thanks to you.

89
00:03:57.545 --> 00:04:00.845
Oh God, we give thanks for your name is near.

90
00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:03.935
We recount your wondrous deeds.

91
00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:07.805
At the set time that I appoint, I will judge with equity.

92
00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:09.735
When the earth tots

93
00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:11.055
and all its inhabitants, it is I

94
00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:12.895
who keeps steady it's pillars.

95
00:04:13.505 --> 00:04:17.085
Sayah, I say to the boastful, do not boast

96
00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.765
and to the wicked, do not lift up your horn.

97
00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:22.645
Do not lift up your horn on high or speak with haughty

98
00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:27.455
or prideful neck for not from the east or from the west

99
00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:29.255
and not from the wilderness comes lifting up.

100
00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:32.695
It is God who executes judgment putting down one

101
00:04:32.695 --> 00:04:33.735
and lifting up another.

102
00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.615
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup

103
00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:38.255
with foaming wine, well mixed.

104
00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:39.815
He pours out from it

105
00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:41.455
and all the wicked of the earth shall

106
00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:42.535
drain it down to the drex.

107
00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:45.245
But I will declare it forever.

108
00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:47.525
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

109
00:04:48.025 --> 00:04:50.125
All the horns of the wicked, I will cut off,

110
00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:54.565
but the horns of the wick, righteous shall be lifted up.

111
00:04:56.645 --> 00:05:00.305
Okay, so this song meant to be sung by the congregation.

112
00:05:00.805 --> 00:05:02.825
Notice how it starts. Verse one.

113
00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:04.865
It says, we give thanks to you.

114
00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:07.705
Oh God, we give thanks for your name is near.

115
00:05:08.045 --> 00:05:11.105
We recount your wondrous deeds.

116
00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:15.065
Now that word recount means exactly what you think it means.

117
00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:18.185
It means to go back over to count again

118
00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:19.705
to remember something.

119
00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:22.385
It's like what I used to do when I was a kid

120
00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:24.105
with a huge bag of Skittles.

121
00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:25.945
I would pour out that five pound bag

122
00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:27.025
right on my grandma's table.

123
00:05:27.325 --> 00:05:29.825
Didn't need all of it at one sitting, maybe two. Okay?

124
00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:32.105
So it was all of that right there.

125
00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:34.105
And I would separate them out

126
00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:36.265
and I would put them into football formations.

127
00:05:36.285 --> 00:05:39.545
And I would have one team, the purple team, Dallas Cowboys

128
00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:42.185
of course on this side against the Redskins on the other

129
00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:44.625
side or or the Bengals and the orange team

130
00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:45.945
or whatever, 11 on 11.

131
00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:47.425
And I would've to count 'em out and then I would

132
00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:48.785
play a play.

133
00:05:48.805 --> 00:05:50.825
And then if they got tackled, they got eaten.

134
00:05:50.965 --> 00:05:53.345
Of course, right? So that's what you would do.

135
00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:55.105
And I would have to recount again

136
00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:56.665
and again to make sure at 11

137
00:05:56.725 --> 00:05:58.845
and 11 recounting over and over.

138
00:05:58.865 --> 00:06:01.005
That's what we're talking about here.

139
00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:04.325
As God's people do that, not with Skittles,

140
00:06:04.385 --> 00:06:08.045
but as God's people remember all God has done

141
00:06:08.145 --> 00:06:09.645
as they remember who he is

142
00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:13.485
and what he has done, how good he is to them, how near he is

143
00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:16.845
to them, how he will do certain things in the future,

144
00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:20.365
remembering all of that, they could not at the time help

145
00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:22.525
but announce their gratitude.

146
00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:27.165
Thank you God, thank you for all you are.

147
00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:31.045
Their first response to his wondrous deeds. Thank you God.

148
00:06:31.335 --> 00:06:34.005
Their first response, how good he's been to them,

149
00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:37.405
their first response to the exodus of getting 'em out

150
00:06:37.405 --> 00:06:40.625
of Egypt is like, thank you, we're grateful.

151
00:06:40.755 --> 00:06:43.145
Thank you God. So that's what we're gonna do.

152
00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:47.035
By the way, we recount God's wondrous deeds

153
00:06:47.045 --> 00:06:48.155
every week in here.

154
00:06:48.155 --> 00:06:50.235
We're not just doing it today in a unique way.

155
00:06:50.295 --> 00:06:54.555
We do it by recounting the gospel, the good news,

156
00:06:55.385 --> 00:06:58.675
this reality that we look at the glory of God.

157
00:06:58.735 --> 00:07:02.435
We recount how he is this in his attributes

158
00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:04.715
and that in his works and he's good

159
00:07:04.735 --> 00:07:06.355
and he's just, and we recount that.

160
00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:07.515
We keep reminding each other,

161
00:07:07.575 --> 00:07:09.195
we keep remembering those kind of things.

162
00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:12.115
Remember last week, mark talked about in Psalm 74

163
00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:13.355
the perspective shift.

164
00:07:13.455 --> 00:07:14.675
That's what we're talking about here,

165
00:07:15.015 --> 00:07:17.115
to climb the mountain of who God is.

166
00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:18.835
So we look at the rest of the world

167
00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:21.475
and we understand rightly how to look at the rest

168
00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:23.755
of the world because we look at who God is

169
00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:27.235
and we remember recount that who he really is.

170
00:07:27.235 --> 00:07:30.675
So that's what we're gonna do. Another aspect of the Psalms

171
00:07:30.675 --> 00:07:32.035
that we need to understand is

172
00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:34.595
that they were not collected haphazardly.

173
00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:36.835
They were collated

174
00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:40.195
and placed where they were on purpose by God.

175
00:07:41.135 --> 00:07:44.515
And if you remember last week, Psalm 74 ended

176
00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:47.555
with this unresolved uncertainty about

177
00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:48.915
the way the world was going.

178
00:07:50.515 --> 00:07:52.095
The temple had been destroyed,

179
00:07:52.835 --> 00:07:55.015
the enemies seemed to be winning.

180
00:07:57.865 --> 00:08:01.015
Well, Psalm 75 then placed right

181
00:08:01.015 --> 00:08:03.535
after that is really God's answer to

182
00:08:03.535 --> 00:08:06.655
what was left unresolved in Psalm 74.

183
00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:10.375
And so look again, you'll see it right here verses two

184
00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:11.415
through five.

185
00:08:12.355 --> 00:08:13.975
If you noticed as I was reading through first,

186
00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:16.255
there's quotation marks at the beginning of this.

187
00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:20.695
This is God. Now speaking, watch this.

188
00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:24.375
At the set time that I appoint, I will judge with equity.

189
00:08:24.925 --> 00:08:26.175
When the earth tots

190
00:08:26.175 --> 00:08:28.175
and all its inhabitants, it is I

191
00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:30.175
who keeps steady its pillars.

192
00:08:31.025 --> 00:08:34.115
Sayah, I say to the boastful, do not boast.

193
00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.755
And I say to the wicked, do not lift up your horn.

194
00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:40.675
Do not lift up your horn on high or speak with haughty

195
00:08:40.675 --> 00:08:42.275
or prideful neck.

196
00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:46.685
I think one of the most common phrases out

197
00:08:46.685 --> 00:08:48.925
of kids' mouths is that's not fair.

198
00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:52.345
Right? Everybody seen that one before, right?

199
00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:55.765
That's not fair. You've heard that we've said it and

200
00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:57.045
and we all get there.

201
00:08:57.265 --> 00:08:58.885
But it's not just kids, right?

202
00:09:00.245 --> 00:09:02.575
Like there's an inherent sense of justice in all of us

203
00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:04.335
as adults as well.

204
00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:10.815
Whether we've personally experienced the injustice of abuse

205
00:09:10.995 --> 00:09:13.015
or racial profiling

206
00:09:14.295 --> 00:09:18.475
or being cheated in some way, or maybe not us.

207
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:21.395
But we've watched somebody experience something like that

208
00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:23.475
and we look at this, we like, that's not fair.

209
00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:27.205
All of us say that.

210
00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:32.305
Well what we just read in Psalm 75 is actually

211
00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:33.825
God's response to all that.

212
00:09:36.305 --> 00:09:37.965
He reminded them back then

213
00:09:37.965 --> 00:09:42.125
and he reminds us today that our response should be to trust

214
00:09:42.695 --> 00:09:44.325
God's just sovereignty,

215
00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:51.265
trust his just sovereignty.

216
00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:55.285
Again, remember back then the people were wondering

217
00:09:55.285 --> 00:09:58.015
where God was enemy

218
00:09:58.015 --> 00:10:01.375
after enemy kept ransacking the land,

219
00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:04.975
they destroyed God's temple, they stole away his people.

220
00:10:05.315 --> 00:10:06.495
And they're looking around at this.

221
00:10:06.495 --> 00:10:07.495
And that's why you see over

222
00:10:07.495 --> 00:10:09.895
and over in the Psalms, they're like, God, where are you?

223
00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:15.495
Do you not see God? This is your people. This is your land.

224
00:10:15.495 --> 00:10:17.495
That's your temple. Do you not see what's happening?

225
00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:18.975
Do you even care?

226
00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:23.835
Which honestly can lead us

227
00:10:25.955 --> 00:10:29.415
to temptations of thinking that maybe God isn't real.

228
00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:33.585
People look around and see evil

229
00:10:33.585 --> 00:10:34.945
and they think, well, God's certainly not

230
00:10:35.015 --> 00:10:36.265
real if this is happening.

231
00:10:37.415 --> 00:10:40.835
Or maybe we, okay, God is real, but maybe he's not good.

232
00:10:42.895 --> 00:10:44.875
People wonder if God is good or,

233
00:10:44.975 --> 00:10:48.075
or maybe we think God's just not strong enough

234
00:10:48.075 --> 00:10:49.235
to handle this situation.

235
00:10:49.345 --> 00:10:51.555
This one's outside of his realm.

236
00:10:55.485 --> 00:10:58.945
Or maybe at the very least we think somehow that the evil

237
00:10:59.645 --> 00:11:02.825
and the wicked in the world will somehow get away with it,

238
00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:05.295
their opposition to God.

239
00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:07.655
And it's just like, well, they're just never God.

240
00:11:07.655 --> 00:11:08.775
Nothing's ever gonna happen.

241
00:11:11.115 --> 00:11:14.135
That's why these verses are so critical for us to remember

242
00:11:14.135 --> 00:11:16.735
because God himself says we need

243
00:11:16.735 --> 00:11:18.255
to trust his just sovereignty

244
00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:20.815
whenever we face situations like that.

245
00:11:21.775 --> 00:11:23.935
'cause he says right up, I'm gonna judge with equity.

246
00:11:25.825 --> 00:11:27.825
I will judge with equity.

247
00:11:27.825 --> 00:11:29.705
Meaning he's not gonna play favorites.

248
00:11:30.425 --> 00:11:32.025
Everyone's gonna be judged on the same standard.

249
00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:36.745
No one gets a pass. He's judging everyone equally.

250
00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:42.175
Those who have a prideful, boastful, haughty,

251
00:11:42.405 --> 00:11:45.775
this this arrogant stance, he'll humble 'em.

252
00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:50.055
Those who lift up their horn,

253
00:11:50.055 --> 00:11:52.455
verse 10 says He's gonna cut it off now.

254
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.285
Now we don't understand that metaphor most likely.

255
00:11:55.585 --> 00:11:58.245
So when you see that, there's a bunch

256
00:11:58.245 --> 00:11:59.445
of different ways you could take this,

257
00:11:59.465 --> 00:12:00.805
but maybe just summary.

258
00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:01.925
Think of a rhino.

259
00:12:03.085 --> 00:12:05.855
When somebody's horn is lifted up against

260
00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:07.175
God, think of a rhino.

261
00:12:07.175 --> 00:12:10.135
That horn on the front is a symbol of its power, right?

262
00:12:10.515 --> 00:12:11.535
You don't want to mess with that.

263
00:12:11.535 --> 00:12:13.495
You don't wanna touch that. It's it's power,

264
00:12:13.605 --> 00:12:15.175
it's authority, it's strength.

265
00:12:16.395 --> 00:12:19.655
That's the idea here to lift up your horn is

266
00:12:19.675 --> 00:12:21.735
to lift up your own power.

267
00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.895
Claim that you have power, you have authority

268
00:12:27.615 --> 00:12:28.625
that was happening back then.

269
00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:30.225
But again, it's not just back then.

270
00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:32.265
That stuff is just as relevant today.

271
00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:35.665
We watch people every day shake their fist at God,

272
00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:42.595
deny his existence, mock him in any number of ways.

273
00:12:45.155 --> 00:12:46.375
And we look at all of that

274
00:12:46.915 --> 00:12:49.975
and it can feel like evil is winning.

275
00:12:50.275 --> 00:12:52.855
It can feel like things are out of control.

276
00:12:53.035 --> 00:12:55.615
It can feel like God's offline for a while

277
00:12:55.795 --> 00:12:57.295
and everything's just going wild.

278
00:12:57.685 --> 00:12:59.015
Look again at verse three.

279
00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:03.295
When the earth totters,

280
00:13:03.295 --> 00:13:05.535
when it's like a teeter totter, when you're a kid, right?

281
00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.935
When it's shaky, when things are going up and down

282
00:13:08.035 --> 00:13:11.015
and all it's inhabitants, not just the earth, everything

283
00:13:11.695 --> 00:13:14.175
included in the earth, all of us, everything seems to be

284
00:13:14.785 --> 00:13:16.015
going wild.

285
00:13:16.155 --> 00:13:19.455
It is I God says, who keeps steady

286
00:13:20.075 --> 00:13:23.815
its pillars say lot.

287
00:13:23.925 --> 00:13:28.325
That word remember stop. Just consider that for a second.

288
00:13:30.275 --> 00:13:34.885
Slow down. Remember when all seems to be out

289
00:13:34.885 --> 00:13:38.925
of control, I'm holding it all together.

290
00:13:41.845 --> 00:13:46.375
When everything seems to be out of whack and it's evil

291
00:13:46.555 --> 00:13:49.855
and wicked and it's you're overwhelmed by it.

292
00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:52.855
God says, no, no, don't forget

293
00:13:53.855 --> 00:13:54.915
I'm holding this thing together.

294
00:13:58.145 --> 00:14:03.065
Nothing is truly out of control. Nothing.

295
00:14:05.265 --> 00:14:09.915
God is sovereign to us. It might feel like it to us.

296
00:14:09.935 --> 00:14:11.595
It might seem like the foundations

297
00:14:11.595 --> 00:14:12.995
of our lives are crumbling

298
00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:15.235
and the pillars of society are falling apart.

299
00:14:15.535 --> 00:14:17.875
It might seem like that to us,

300
00:14:19.055 --> 00:14:20.915
but God is keeping it all together.

301
00:14:21.185 --> 00:14:23.035
It's God who is actually studying it

302
00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:28.515
and it's God who will bring it all to completion.

303
00:14:30.755 --> 00:14:34.295
That's the kind of God that the apostle Paul was able

304
00:14:34.315 --> 00:14:35.495
to write to

305
00:14:35.635 --> 00:14:38.695
and write about Second Corinthians four, eight and nine.

306
00:14:38.695 --> 00:14:41.615
Because God is just because God is right

307
00:14:41.635 --> 00:14:43.095
and God is sovereign.

308
00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:46.535
He could write this. We are afflicted in every way

309
00:14:46.715 --> 00:14:48.095
but not crushed.

310
00:14:50.165 --> 00:14:52.825
We are perplexed but not driven to despair.

311
00:14:54.205 --> 00:14:56.425
We are persecuted but not forsaken.

312
00:14:57.675 --> 00:15:00.615
We are struck down but we're not destroyed.

313
00:15:03.795 --> 00:15:08.045
'cause he knew, he knew God was holding it all together

314
00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:10.475
and it wouldn't be like this forever.

315
00:15:13.735 --> 00:15:15.955
Yet we can't forget something about Psalm 75,

316
00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:19.355
that verse two, look again at the first line,

317
00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:21.155
Psalm 75, verse two.

318
00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:25.955
It says, God says, at the set time that I appoint,

319
00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:31.115
I will judge with equity not on

320
00:15:31.115 --> 00:15:32.315
our timeline, right?

321
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.185
This is his time.

322
00:15:35.405 --> 00:15:39.305
Not when we think God should bring the judgment his time.

323
00:15:41.425 --> 00:15:42.805
No, it's his right time.

324
00:15:42.905 --> 00:15:45.005
We might not fully understand it probably won't,

325
00:15:45.305 --> 00:15:47.605
but it's his right time, his right way.

326
00:15:47.605 --> 00:15:51.325
That's where the trust factor comes in here that we trust.

327
00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:54.645
His ways are right. We trust his timing is right.

328
00:15:56.645 --> 00:16:00.725
I heard it said justice delayed is not the same thing

329
00:16:00.725 --> 00:16:02.165
as justice denied.

330
00:16:04.555 --> 00:16:06.405
Just because it's not happened on our timeline

331
00:16:06.405 --> 00:16:07.445
doesn't mean it's not gonna happen.

332
00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:13.665
He will. It says, I will judge with equity.

333
00:16:16.515 --> 00:16:17.615
That's why we can count on

334
00:16:17.615 --> 00:16:20.855
what Paul wrote in Romans 12 verse 19.

335
00:16:20.915 --> 00:16:23.295
He said, beloved never avenge yourselves

336
00:16:23.995 --> 00:16:27.295
but leave it to the wrath of God for it is written,

337
00:16:27.565 --> 00:16:28.895
vengeance is mine.

338
00:16:29.415 --> 00:16:33.495
I will repay, says the Lord. This is his deal.

339
00:16:34.345 --> 00:16:38.315
It's his time, it's his justice, it's his sovereignty.

340
00:16:38.335 --> 00:16:42.355
We trust him. We trust this holy God who will do

341
00:16:42.515 --> 00:16:44.355
what is right, the sovereign one,

342
00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:45.675
the Lord of the universe forever.

343
00:16:46.015 --> 00:16:48.835
We trust him that he is holy

344
00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:52.475
and he will take care of what he needs to take care of,

345
00:16:53.935 --> 00:16:55.875
his time his way, but he will do it.

346
00:16:57.455 --> 00:17:00.955
So we just saw God speak about this perspective.

347
00:17:02.475 --> 00:17:04.405
Well, Psalm 75 then shifts back

348
00:17:04.405 --> 00:17:06.285
to the author speaking about God

349
00:17:06.305 --> 00:17:09.685
and how he's going to judge And look at verses six

350
00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:14.625
through eight again says, for not from the east

351
00:17:14.645 --> 00:17:16.025
or from the west and not from the

352
00:17:16.025 --> 00:17:17.305
wilderness comes lifting up.

353
00:17:17.725 --> 00:17:21.265
But it is God who executes judgment putting down one

354
00:17:21.265 --> 00:17:24.025
and lifting up another for in the hand of the Lord.

355
00:17:24.025 --> 00:17:26.065
There's a cup with foaming wine, well mixed

356
00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:27.585
and he pours out from it

357
00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.665
and all the wicked of the earth shall drain

358
00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:30.865
it down to the dregs.

359
00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:34.985
You see the first part of verse 10 as well, all the horns

360
00:17:34.985 --> 00:17:37.105
of the wicked I will cut off.

361
00:17:39.085 --> 00:17:41.625
And so we just learned we can trust God's sovereignty,

362
00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:45.225
that he's gonna do what's right at his time, his way.

363
00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:49.415
We can trust that. And here we see his justice.

364
00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:54.415
Uh, for those who who claim to be self-made for those

365
00:17:54.435 --> 00:17:58.495
who prop up their own manmade power structure,

366
00:17:59.115 --> 00:18:02.295
it says God will cut off that horn in judgment.

367
00:18:04.545 --> 00:18:07.485
But not even just like self-made like I can do this myself.

368
00:18:07.635 --> 00:18:10.085
It's even anything else the world would promote.

369
00:18:10.505 --> 00:18:12.565
That's what verse six talks about from the east

370
00:18:12.565 --> 00:18:13.725
or the west or the wilderness.

371
00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:16.125
There's nothing in this world.

372
00:18:16.235 --> 00:18:19.725
Nothing is actually what elevates a person to a place

373
00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:21.445
of power or authority.

374
00:18:21.955 --> 00:18:24.165
True exaltation, nothing in the world does that.

375
00:18:24.165 --> 00:18:25.685
It's only from God.

376
00:18:28.655 --> 00:18:30.115
You see it throughout the scriptures.

377
00:18:30.185 --> 00:18:33.315
It's God who appoints leaders of nations

378
00:18:35.165 --> 00:18:39.275
for blessing or for judgment, right?

379
00:18:39.275 --> 00:18:44.035
Sometimes God gives a nation a just right good leader

380
00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:45.435
to bless that nation

381
00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:50.655
and sometimes he gives them a wicked evil leader

382
00:18:51.195 --> 00:18:52.655
to judge that nation.

383
00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:56.845
It's God who raises up.

384
00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.965
It's God who puts down

385
00:19:00.865 --> 00:19:04.245
and notice verse eight talks about this, this cup

386
00:19:04.305 --> 00:19:06.165
of well mixed foaming wine.

387
00:19:06.305 --> 00:19:09.005
God is holding from which he pours out

388
00:19:09.645 --> 00:19:11.125
judgment on the wicked of the earth.

389
00:19:11.265 --> 00:19:13.045
Now, what in the world is that even talking about

390
00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:15.985
it's imagery of course.

391
00:19:16.205 --> 00:19:20.435
And what it means though is it's pretty common in the Bible

392
00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:25.465
to see this image pop up that there's a cup of God's wrath.

393
00:19:27.455 --> 00:19:30.595
We see it in places like Jeremiah 25 toward all the nations

394
00:19:30.595 --> 00:19:31.915
that refuse to worship God.

395
00:19:33.565 --> 00:19:36.345
We see it in Habak two toward the Chaldeans

396
00:19:36.345 --> 00:19:37.945
who were defrauding other people.

397
00:19:38.525 --> 00:19:40.865
The cup of God's wrath was poured out on them.

398
00:19:41.865 --> 00:19:43.355
It's all over the book of Revelation.

399
00:19:44.855 --> 00:19:47.445
God's judgment on those who worship false gods,

400
00:19:47.865 --> 00:19:49.165
his cup is poured out.

401
00:19:49.165 --> 00:19:53.365
In fact, let me just show you Revelation 14, verse 10.

402
00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:57.405
He will drink the wine of God's wrath,

403
00:19:58.795 --> 00:20:01.455
poured full strength into the cup of his anger.

404
00:20:02.405 --> 00:20:03.795
He'll be tormented with fire.

405
00:20:04.375 --> 00:20:07.515
And sulfur like that is wrath imagery.

406
00:20:07.515 --> 00:20:09.755
That's judgment imagery.

407
00:20:09.815 --> 00:20:11.475
Now, we don't like talking about this, right?

408
00:20:13.465 --> 00:20:16.285
In fact, people all over deny this.

409
00:20:19.485 --> 00:20:23.065
But the reality is that those who refuse

410
00:20:23.125 --> 00:20:26.425
to worship the one true God will be judged.

411
00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:32.905
It will be final, it will be full, right?

412
00:20:32.905 --> 00:20:35.265
That's the phrase, drain it down to the dregs.

413
00:20:35.265 --> 00:20:37.225
That's what that illustrates. That like you've sucked the

414
00:20:37.225 --> 00:20:39.745
very last drop out of that cup

415
00:20:41.405 --> 00:20:43.505
and that wrath is full and final.

416
00:20:43.515 --> 00:20:46.025
There is nothing left that's coming one day.

417
00:20:48.925 --> 00:20:51.715
Again, for those who live in arrogant defiance

418
00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:55.635
of God's rule in their life, he will pour out the cup

419
00:20:55.655 --> 00:20:57.675
of his wrath on them forever.

420
00:21:02.075 --> 00:21:04.535
Now, for the believer, if you're a believer in Christ

421
00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:07.055
for the believer, there is a measure of of comfort

422
00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:08.215
that comes from that.

423
00:21:09.905 --> 00:21:11.795
Because we do look around in the world

424
00:21:11.975 --> 00:21:16.235
and we see wickedness winning and overcoming and destroying

425
00:21:16.235 --> 00:21:17.835
and hurting and defrauding and,

426
00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:19.875
and this is a measure of comfort

427
00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:23.635
because this says God is going to execute ju justice.

428
00:21:24.895 --> 00:21:28.195
He is going to bring right true judgment.

429
00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:31.555
The wicked won't get away with it in the end.

430
00:21:35.465 --> 00:21:37.245
But there's also a warning here, right?

431
00:21:41.395 --> 00:21:45.395
And the consistent drumbeat of scripture says that those

432
00:21:45.415 --> 00:21:49.435
who oppose God should fear his final judgment.

433
00:21:52.735 --> 00:21:56.475
Anyone who opposes God raises their horn,

434
00:21:56.475 --> 00:21:59.315
their self power authority against him

435
00:21:59.335 --> 00:22:01.475
and refuses the rule of God in their life

436
00:22:02.175 --> 00:22:05.855
should fear God's final judgment.

437
00:22:08.885 --> 00:22:10.695
Because the truth of the matter is

438
00:22:10.695 --> 00:22:15.495
that apart from an intervention every human being is

439
00:22:15.495 --> 00:22:16.895
underneath the wrath of God.

440
00:22:17.275 --> 00:22:18.335
We were born into sin.

441
00:22:18.335 --> 00:22:22.495
We also sin ourselves and that separates us from God.

442
00:22:22.595 --> 00:22:24.055
We fall short of the glory of God.

443
00:22:24.275 --> 00:22:25.855
We are due his judgment

444
00:22:25.855 --> 00:22:29.585
because of that apart from any intervention

445
00:22:29.615 --> 00:22:32.465
that is the destiny of every human.

446
00:22:33.295 --> 00:22:35.545
None are righteous. No one can get out

447
00:22:35.685 --> 00:22:37.905
of his wrath on their own, can get clear

448
00:22:37.905 --> 00:22:39.265
of his wrath on their own.

449
00:22:42.615 --> 00:22:43.875
And I think we just need to stop

450
00:22:43.875 --> 00:22:45.075
and sit on this for a second

451
00:22:45.075 --> 00:22:46.355
and think about this for a moment.

452
00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:50.765
Like there's no song we can sing for this one,

453
00:22:53.465 --> 00:22:56.245
but I think we need to stop and consider it for a second.

454
00:23:00.405 --> 00:23:03.665
So right where you are, just just stop, bow your head.

455
00:23:05.095 --> 00:23:07.625
Consider this reality. Let's just be

456
00:23:07.625 --> 00:23:10.545
quiet in light of this.

457
00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:18.175
And I just, I just want us to think on

458
00:23:19.615 --> 00:23:23.925
God's final judgment that is coming for all

459
00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:25.765
who turn away from him in sin.

460
00:23:30.345 --> 00:23:31.795
Just think about this reality and

461
00:23:32.735 --> 00:23:34.795
and so I'm gonna talk about it in a couple ways.

462
00:23:34.795 --> 00:23:37.995
First, for you, believer, if you are a believer in Christ,

463
00:23:37.995 --> 00:23:40.235
there can be a bit of comfort here

464
00:23:43.035 --> 00:23:47.665
that God will humble those who shake their fist at him,

465
00:23:47.665 --> 00:23:51.625
that his judgment is truly coming, justice is coming.

466
00:23:51.885 --> 00:23:55.745
We know our suffering is not the end of the story.

467
00:23:58.785 --> 00:24:00.685
He will make it all right.

468
00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:07.955
Just rest in that for a second.

469
00:24:07.985 --> 00:24:12.545
Believe her, find some comfort there.

470
00:24:23.905 --> 00:24:28.435
Yet even as we do that, we should never rejoice

471
00:24:29.375 --> 00:24:30.915
at the destruction of the wicked.

472
00:24:34.805 --> 00:24:37.625
So we should also feel at the same time a measure of grief

473
00:24:40.005 --> 00:24:42.295
over sin and urgency

474
00:24:43.075 --> 00:24:47.215
to declare God's gracious works to all

475
00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:54.405
ask him for the urgency.

476
00:25:08.795 --> 00:25:10.015
But I'm also aware that some

477
00:25:10.015 --> 00:25:12.935
of you sitting here are not followers of Christ.

478
00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:17.245
I just wanna say first, thank you for being here.

479
00:25:20.045 --> 00:25:22.205
I don't enjoy having to say these things,

480
00:25:22.205 --> 00:25:23.605
but it's what God said in his word.

481
00:25:24.265 --> 00:25:29.025
So if that's you, I would just invite you

482
00:25:29.025 --> 00:25:33.465
to take all this in to feel the weight

483
00:25:35.215 --> 00:25:37.185
that there is an end coming,

484
00:25:39.235 --> 00:25:41.765
that there is a God we are accountable to,

485
00:25:45.285 --> 00:25:48.225
and that if you continue on the track of self worship

486
00:25:49.135 --> 00:25:53.615
denying God, then this is what your end will look like.

487
00:25:58.245 --> 00:25:59.365
I don't want that for you.

488
00:26:05.995 --> 00:26:09.775
Just consider what God has said here.

489
00:26:31.305 --> 00:26:33.365
But the fact that his judgment is coming

490
00:26:35.365 --> 00:26:38.425
is why we all need to see this last section of Psalm 75.

491
00:26:40.605 --> 00:26:42.655
Because if that judgment truly is coming,

492
00:26:45.615 --> 00:26:48.465
then is there a way out for sinners,

493
00:26:51.275 --> 00:26:53.525
sinners like you and me, where again,

494
00:26:53.535 --> 00:26:55.325
apart from an intervention, every one

495
00:26:55.325 --> 00:26:57.085
of us is headed towards this.

496
00:26:57.185 --> 00:26:58.685
Is there a way out? What's the answer

497
00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:00.405
if this is really bad news?

498
00:27:00.405 --> 00:27:01.645
What's the answer to this?

499
00:27:04.205 --> 00:27:06.505
What's what ASAP alludes to here in verses nine

500
00:27:06.505 --> 00:27:07.705
and 10, remember verse one.

501
00:27:07.705 --> 00:27:11.185
He started by giving thanks recounting God's wondrous deeds

502
00:27:11.185 --> 00:27:13.265
here at the end verses nine and 10.

503
00:27:13.325 --> 00:27:16.785
But I will declare it forever. What's he talking about?

504
00:27:16.815 --> 00:27:18.145
What is it first?

505
00:27:18.255 --> 00:27:20.865
Well, it's what he just said about God's justice.

506
00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:26.845
But there's more to it. I will declare it forever.

507
00:27:27.485 --> 00:27:29.565
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

508
00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:33.005
Yes, all the horns, the wicked all be cut, will be cut off,

509
00:27:33.305 --> 00:27:36.325
but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

510
00:27:39.485 --> 00:27:43.335
So what's he declaring here? He's declaring salvation.

511
00:27:45.865 --> 00:27:48.155
He's declaring God's salvation.

512
00:27:48.155 --> 00:27:49.755
But notice he does it in an interesting way.

513
00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:54.475
He declares both God's justice and God's mercy.

514
00:27:57.325 --> 00:28:00.905
He declares justice and mercy of God.

515
00:28:03.655 --> 00:28:06.595
He doesn't just sit around with the choir, the congregation,

516
00:28:06.975 --> 00:28:08.115
and praise God

517
00:28:08.115 --> 00:28:10.875
because we know God's gonna cut the wicked's horn off.

518
00:28:10.935 --> 00:28:12.715
We know that all this is gonna happen.

519
00:28:13.005 --> 00:28:15.195
God's gonna make it right. God's gonna bring justice.

520
00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:17.275
God's gonna humble those who turn away from him.

521
00:28:17.525 --> 00:28:19.835
We're not just gonna sit back and throw stones at them.

522
00:28:20.105 --> 00:28:22.955
He's also saying, no, I'm declaring God's mercy

523
00:28:23.215 --> 00:28:27.295
to his people because he says not only the horns

524
00:28:27.295 --> 00:28:28.495
of the wicked be cut off, the horns

525
00:28:28.495 --> 00:28:30.175
of the righteous shall be lifted up.

526
00:28:34.495 --> 00:28:36.215
I know what you're thinking though. You just heard me

527
00:28:36.275 --> 00:28:39.535
say no one is righteous.

528
00:28:43.435 --> 00:28:45.845
There's not one. Romans three

529
00:28:45.875 --> 00:28:49.925
says, well, on our own.

530
00:28:49.925 --> 00:28:52.595
That's true. Every one

531
00:28:52.595 --> 00:28:55.635
of us on our own judged against the standard of God's glory,

532
00:28:55.695 --> 00:28:57.155
we all fall short of that.

533
00:28:57.555 --> 00:28:58.715
Absolutely none are righteous.

534
00:28:58.715 --> 00:29:03.075
But we read this psalm through the lenses

535
00:29:03.255 --> 00:29:05.875
of Christ, through the lenses of the New Testament

536
00:29:07.085 --> 00:29:10.615
because Romans 3 22 says, the righteousness

537
00:29:10.675 --> 00:29:14.295
of God is manifested through faith in Jesus Christ

538
00:29:14.395 --> 00:29:15.695
for all who believe.

539
00:29:16.775 --> 00:29:21.625
What that means is that God gives us his righteousness.

540
00:29:21.965 --> 00:29:23.545
He makes us righteous.

541
00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:25.985
When we place our faith in Jesus Christ,

542
00:29:26.015 --> 00:29:30.265
when we place our faith in him, he gives us righteousness.

543
00:29:31.605 --> 00:29:33.465
So when he says here, the horns

544
00:29:33.465 --> 00:29:34.745
of the righteous will be lifted up.

545
00:29:35.485 --> 00:29:38.935
That's really Jesus. But we've been made righteous

546
00:29:39.635 --> 00:29:42.045
and we will be lifted up as well.

547
00:29:42.065 --> 00:29:45.125
And so I know man, that conceptually, intellectually

548
00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:49.235
that sounds too simple, like God just can't make this like

549
00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.355
just switch it, right?

550
00:29:51.355 --> 00:29:53.585
Because we're guilty in a courtroom,

551
00:29:53.845 --> 00:29:55.385
we would be held as guilty.

552
00:29:55.645 --> 00:29:57.465
So he can't just switch it.

553
00:29:58.375 --> 00:30:00.825
Something has to be done for the sin.

554
00:30:01.385 --> 00:30:03.545
Judgment has to come, payment has to be made.

555
00:30:03.545 --> 00:30:04.705
Something has to be done.

556
00:30:04.965 --> 00:30:06.665
It seems too simple, but here's why.

557
00:30:06.665 --> 00:30:08.585
That's a legitimate solution to our problem.

558
00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:13.625
Remember the cup of God's wrath, Psalm 75,

559
00:30:17.105 --> 00:30:20.015
I want you to listen to what Jesus said to Peter

560
00:30:21.785 --> 00:30:24.045
in the garden the night before he was crucified.

561
00:30:24.675 --> 00:30:26.405
John 1811, Jesus says,

562
00:30:26.535 --> 00:30:29.845
shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?

563
00:30:31.965 --> 00:30:33.135
What cup's he talking about?

564
00:30:35.895 --> 00:30:39.505
He's talking about this cup of God's wrath towards sin.

565
00:30:42.505 --> 00:30:43.525
See, here's the reality.

566
00:30:43.545 --> 00:30:47.725
If we merely speak of the cross as God's mercy

567
00:30:48.265 --> 00:30:51.975
to us, and we sit around and we rejoice

568
00:30:51.975 --> 00:30:53.495
and we talk about the old rugged cross

569
00:30:53.515 --> 00:30:55.455
and it's like, oh, God loves us so much.

570
00:30:55.605 --> 00:30:57.775
He's so merciful to us, and that's true.

571
00:30:58.075 --> 00:31:00.015
But if we don't include

572
00:31:02.135 --> 00:31:04.675
and couple that with the judgment that Jesus

573
00:31:05.195 --> 00:31:08.475
averted from us on the cross, then it's powerless.

574
00:31:09.515 --> 00:31:11.845
It's just kind of some sentimental feeling about the love

575
00:31:11.845 --> 00:31:14.965
of God Shona through the cross to us.

576
00:31:16.255 --> 00:31:18.395
But when we put it next to

577
00:31:18.615 --> 00:31:22.395
and with the judgment that was due us, that was then

578
00:31:22.995 --> 00:31:26.475
averted from us by Jesus dying on the cross, that's

579
00:31:26.475 --> 00:31:27.795
where it gets its power, right?

580
00:31:30.005 --> 00:31:34.935
See, the reality is that 2000 years ago, God's justice

581
00:31:35.355 --> 00:31:37.775
and God's mercy met at the cross.

582
00:31:39.685 --> 00:31:41.425
He didn't just wipe sin away.

583
00:31:41.445 --> 00:31:44.465
He didn't just change the narrative. He paid for it.

584
00:31:45.915 --> 00:31:47.295
He took the judgment.

585
00:31:48.075 --> 00:31:52.335
The perfect sacrificial lamb of God went on that cross

586
00:31:52.715 --> 00:31:54.975
and drained that cup of God's wrath

587
00:31:55.075 --> 00:31:57.135
to its very dregs as it says.

588
00:31:57.355 --> 00:32:00.255
He drank every last drop of it for those who believe.

589
00:32:00.395 --> 00:32:03.055
He took it all away and said, now you're free.

590
00:32:04.885 --> 00:32:08.025
And as that cup was poured out on him,

591
00:32:09.655 --> 00:32:12.505
what was poured out of his body was his new covenant blood.

592
00:32:12.525 --> 00:32:14.145
To forgive all of our sin

593
00:32:14.255 --> 00:32:15.945
that put him on the cross in the first place.

594
00:32:18.065 --> 00:32:20.845
His justice and his mercy met.

595
00:32:20.905 --> 00:32:22.565
That's the good news that we declare.

596
00:32:22.795 --> 00:32:24.045
It's not just bad news

597
00:32:24.045 --> 00:32:25.925
and it's not just some sentimental feeling.

598
00:32:25.995 --> 00:32:29.045
It's good news that fixes the bad news

599
00:32:29.185 --> 00:32:31.935
of justice judgment.

600
00:32:33.235 --> 00:32:37.655
Do us Jesus did it for us. Yes.

601
00:32:39.145 --> 00:32:42.125
And so listen, I talked a lot about wrath

602
00:32:43.025 --> 00:32:45.685
and it's not meant to, to scare, scare people.

603
00:32:46.225 --> 00:32:49.085
The point is, I if you have repented,

604
00:32:49.345 --> 00:32:51.565
and I'm not trying to create some like weird,

605
00:32:51.885 --> 00:32:54.445
I don't believe I, I am I really a Christian kind of thing.

606
00:32:54.445 --> 00:32:57.125
That's not the goal. If you have repented

607
00:32:57.225 --> 00:33:01.005
and believed in Jesus Christ, one Thessalonians one 10 says,

608
00:33:01.005 --> 00:33:03.565
you have been delivered from the wrath of God.

609
00:33:05.165 --> 00:33:09.755
No more fear. If you are in Christ, you're free.

610
00:33:10.495 --> 00:33:13.515
No more fear, no more doubt, no more question like, okay,

611
00:33:13.515 --> 00:33:14.675
yeah, you're gonna feel different things,

612
00:33:14.735 --> 00:33:17.235
but you can claim Jesus in my place.

613
00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:20.395
That's my hope. Not whether I feel saved

614
00:33:20.455 --> 00:33:22.635
or whether it took last year at camp or not.

615
00:33:22.905 --> 00:33:27.035
It's Jesus in my place. That's my hope.

616
00:33:29.085 --> 00:33:31.065
He delivers us from the wrath to come.

617
00:33:31.065 --> 00:33:33.265
But listen, if you have not repented

618
00:33:33.265 --> 00:33:38.125
and believed in Jesus, see the warning

619
00:33:38.395 --> 00:33:42.205
here, this is what John 3 36 says.

620
00:33:42.985 --> 00:33:46.435
Whoever believes in the Son of God has eternal life.

621
00:33:47.765 --> 00:33:49.735
Whoever does not obey

622
00:33:49.755 --> 00:33:54.055
or does not believe in the Son of God shall not see life.

623
00:33:54.595 --> 00:33:58.055
But listen, the wrath of God remains on him.

624
00:34:01.505 --> 00:34:05.905
That's the warning delivered from the wrath to come.

625
00:34:05.905 --> 00:34:09.585
When you believe the wrath of God remains on him.

626
00:34:09.765 --> 00:34:13.635
If that's you and you know

627
00:34:14.255 --> 00:34:18.045
you've never believed, I invite you

628
00:34:18.145 --> 00:34:22.165
to trust in this Christ who has drunk the cup of God's wrath

629
00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:24.725
to the very fullest in your place

630
00:34:24.945 --> 00:34:27.405
to deliver you from that wrath to come.

631
00:34:28.895 --> 00:34:30.345
He's done it all. You don't have to be

632
00:34:30.925 --> 00:34:32.265
trying to earn your way anymore.

633
00:34:32.265 --> 00:34:33.865
You don't have to be exhausted by it anymore.

634
00:34:33.925 --> 00:34:38.095
You just get to receive it for all that he's done for you.

635
00:34:40.975 --> 00:34:43.465
That the cross life, death,

636
00:34:43.465 --> 00:34:46.585
and resurrection of Jesus, that is the primary

637
00:34:47.345 --> 00:34:50.705
wondrous deed that we recount as a church,

638
00:34:51.135 --> 00:34:52.945
that we recount as believers.

639
00:34:53.045 --> 00:34:56.225
That's why we give thanks to our God.

640
00:34:56.325 --> 00:34:59.225
That's why we sing praises to the Lord God Almighty.

641
00:34:59.225 --> 00:35:02.105
That's why we worship Jesus Christ, our Lord.

642
00:35:02.165 --> 00:35:04.625
So let's do that now together, church, right?

643
00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:05.825
If you're able, let's stand

644
00:35:06.005 --> 00:35:09.025
and respond to these truths with grateful praise

645
00:35:09.305 --> 00:35:10.785
'cause this is our God church.

646
00:35:11.775 --> 00:35:14.425
This is who He is. This is what he does. He saves us.
