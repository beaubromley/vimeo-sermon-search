1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.300
for the grace of God offers salvation

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.300
to all people

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.200
teaching us to live Godly life.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.100
Jesus gave himself for us to redeem us

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.200
and to purify for himself a people

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.700
that are his very own.

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.100
Good morning, again church. It's a joy to be together. I

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.300
hope you are here is starting off

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.100
great. It's been a strong week here as we have been.

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.400
Starting our year as a church with what we've called the week of prayer

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.600
and it's been focusing our hearts on the Lord in Devotion

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.300
to him and we've already seen fruit from this.

13
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.100
This is a really incredible story we

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.500
Prayed Wednesday morning together in our student room just as

15
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
a church devoting Our Lives to him. And and one

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.100
of the things we prayed for was that salvation would come through our church. Well, I

17
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.600
got a text message after lunch on Wednesday. And one of

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.300
our group leaders was sitting with one of his group members

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.600
and that man came to believe that jesus' Savior

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200
and Lord and repent of his sins right there. So like praise the Lord

21
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.100
for that what a gift that was to my soul,

22
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.700
of course and so let's just pray for more right? That's ask

23
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.600
God for what we see his his desire for

24
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200
us to be but as you saw in the bumper video

25
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.300
which by the way Nick Woods on our staff does that he does really

26
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.800
well with those videos and his wife is due today for

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.000
their first child and so just pray for them. But today

28
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.800
is again an exciting day as we begin

29
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.900
a new sermon series through the book of Titus and

30
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.200
walking all the way through that short New

31
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.400
Testament book verse by verse over the next nine weeks. And

32
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.800
so go ahead and turn there with me in your copy of God's word to the

33
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.800
book of Titus. It's

34
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.500
The end if you're not familiar with it.

35
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.100
After first and second Timothy before a really long book

36
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.000
called Hebrews the book of Titus and he can

37
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.500
bookmark it.

38
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.900
We also have journals available. We've done this over the last few years if you

39
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.300
want to just a scripture Journal that's got the

40
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.200
text description on one side and blank lines on the other. There's some

41
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.100
out there at the library the bookstore. So if you would do

42
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.800
that be able to grab one of those on the way and

43
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.100
just keep along with us if you want to

44
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.300
as we get into it today though, you know that feeling when

45
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.400
you walk into a crowded room and every face

46
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.300
is a stranger.

47
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.200
Like you walk in maybe it's the airport or whatever it is. And you're just walking.

48
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.100
You don't know anybody and it's kind of like this disorienting feeling.

49
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.600
And it's overwhelming and you can kind of feel helpless at

50
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.900
times whenever it's just so much unknown there.

51
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.400
That's why by the way, just if you're new to our church, I understand how

52
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.700
hard it is to walk into a place like this.

53
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.100
And to do what you're doing today if you're here

54
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.100
for the first time and so we hope we can make it as welcoming as

55
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.500
possible for you. We want you to get connected here. I

56
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.900
want you to get to meet people here. We want to know you better

57
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.500
here.

58
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.100
But imagine that same scene you walk into this crowded

59
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.400
room, you know, nobody and you're you're

60
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.100
paddling through the Sea of people.

61
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.700
And suddenly you see the face of your best friend.

62
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.500
Like everything changes, right?

63
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.300
Your heartbeat slows. Everything gets a little bit less

64
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.600
crazy. You're finally you're finally safe. You're

65
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.700
with your people, you know.

66
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.600
There's joy. There's security. There's relief.

67
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.200
The point is that there's nothing like being known.

68
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.200
Nothing, like being known by someone.

69
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.500
In the chaos of things, it feels safe.

70
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.200
when you have that connection

71
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.500
the title of this sermon series is his very own.

72
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.800
It's taken from Titus to 14, which says that Jesus gave himself

73
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.200
for us to redeem us from all lawlessness

74
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.100
and to purify for himself a people

75
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.700
for his own possession.

76
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.300
Who are zealous for good works?

77
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.400
A people for his possession both

78
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.200
individuals for his possession and

79
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.500
a group of people who are his that

80
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.700
are his own that are known by him.

81
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.600
They were sacrificed for and they were purchased by

82
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.200
the Lord Jesus himself.

83
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.800
I know we're jumping right into this. But but listen that that

84
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.400
reality.

85
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.800
Should change everything.

86
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.600
right that reality right there that that he purchased and

87
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.800
knows should change everything for believers first

88
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.200
like being his

89
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.300
should show up in our actions and our choices and our thoughts.

90
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.100
that we are his

91
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.800
should change everything but then even same for our church.

92
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.800
That this is his.

93
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400
And since it's his then we should do everything to make the

94
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.900
church look like he wants it.

95
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.400
Not what we want or what our preferences would

96
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.100
be. It's what does he want?

97
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.400
So that's what we'll see throughout the next nine weeks how how this idea

98
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.600
of being known and being owned and being loved by

99
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.400
the Lord changes both our daily

100
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.400
lives, but also our church life.

101
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.500
And we need to be humble as we walk through this because we might be confronted in some

102
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.700
things.

103
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.300
As well as encouraging some things.

104
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.200
So get us started today, we're going to look just at the introduction to this

105
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.400
letter.

106
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.000
How even the introduction is filled with the gospel as as Paul

107
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.200
writes dear Titus. There's all over this.

108
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.000
There's the gospel.

109
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.500
So look at verses 1 through 4.

110
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.400
Paul a servant of God and an apostle

111
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.900
of Jesus Christ

112
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.300
For the sake of the faith of God's elect and their knowledge

113
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.900
of the truth.

114
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.500
Which Accords with godliness?

115
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.300
In Hope of eternal life which God

116
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.800
who never lies promised before the ages began.

117
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.400
And at the proper time manifested in his word through

118
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.500
the preaching with which I've been entrusted by the command of

119
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.700
God our savior.

120
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.900
to Titus

121
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.700
My true child in a common faith.

122
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.200
Grace and peace from God the father and

123
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.000
Christ Jesus our savior.

124
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.700
God help us to see what you want us to see in this today.

125
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.400
Just these four verses how much there is there God show

126
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.400
us a picture of what it means to

127
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.200
be yours to be known.

128
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.900
Lead us individually and as a church.

129
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.700
to be yours

130
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.700
shine brightly as yours

131
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.100
with you shining through us.

132
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.600
Help us. See it. Give us soft Hearts ready soil in

133
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.400
our hearts today.

134
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.300
In Jesus name amen.

135
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.600
Now if you're familiar with the Bible, you might recognize that

136
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.700
there is a bit of a formula to Paul's letters.

137
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.400
Now rarely is it exact wording? But often there's

138
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.300
a pattern a pretty consistent pattern.

139
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.400
In fact, I saw this somewhere. I thought it was kind of funny, but the

140
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.400
general outline of Paul's letters could be this you'll see

141
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.400
we'll put up on the screen as it goes through and if you know the Bible the

142
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.500
New Testament you'll kind of see what I'm talking about General outline

143
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.500
of Paul's letters First Grace.

144
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.700
I thank God for you.

145
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.800
Hold fast to the gospel.

146
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.100
For the Love of everything holy stop being foolish

147
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.700
Timothy says hi.

148
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.000
That's pretty much it, right?

149
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.300
So it's it's that kind of feel and in

150
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.200
Titus is like that you've already seen it here. You saw a couple of those

151
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.200
pieces because we can't remember we can't forget that these

152
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.700
were originally letters. Like this was not a book that

153
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.500
was written back. Then these were letters written the big

154
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.500
word we use for it is called Epistles these letters

155
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.400
that was an an authoritative letter written

156
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.400
to a church and and so a letter is like

157
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.900
an olden days when used to write things down on paper, you'd fold

158
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.200
it. You'd put it in an envelope you'd put a

159
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.600
stamp on you put in the mailbox and somebody would take it to them from

160
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.000
that. That's that's what we're talking about here. Right? These are letters written

161
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.500
from one person to the next or or one

162
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.500
person to a church.

163
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.900
One person to a group of churches. Those are

164
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.800
all what we see in the New Testament.

165
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.300
Now just a quick overview of the New Testament Matthew Mark Luke

166
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.500
and John are called the gospels. Those are eyewitness accounts

167
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.100
of Jesus.

168
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.600
Then acts comes next and it was a historical record of

169
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.300
the early church kind of how God did his work through

170
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.400
the early church, then from there on it's nearly

171
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.200
all just letters.

172
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.500
These kind of things like what we're talking about here in in Titus.

173
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.400
Now the context of where all this happened in Titus was

174
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.300
the island of Crete now if you may

175
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.200
not be familiar with your Mediterranean geography. So we put

176
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.200
a map up on the screen a map of the Mediterranean area in

177
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.800
the first century. You'll see here Jerusalem Judea Samaria

178
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.800
there on the right. That's the where Israel is

179
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.400
and then you see on the very West the the

180
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.100
left you'll see Rome and that's Italy.

181
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.400
Right in the middle. You see that big island. That's Crete.

182
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.300
It's colored yellow here on the map. But that's where this

183
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.800
letter it says Titus was working.

184
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.300
He was strengthening the churches and planting

185
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.200
Church. You'll see throughout the whole letter. And Paul here is

186
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.100
instructing his Protege his his disciple on

187
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.700
how to do that.

188
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.200
So now you kind of have the context now what we need to understand before we

189
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.700
get too far into this is who the main players were.

190
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.400
Again context matters. So who was involved where

191
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.300
were we who was doing what who wrote

192
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.200
it all of those things because it helps us understand the whole letter better

193
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.600
when we know who was involved.

194
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.500
Well, I hope you saw it a course from the first few verses here. The

195
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.900
main character of this letter is

196
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.000
God

197
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.300
yes, it's a little sorry a little tricky on that one. But you see it here

198
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.700
that it was God was the main character is

199
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.500
the main character here because even as Paul talks about himself or

200
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.300
talks about others. It's in relation to God and his

201
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.700
work in their lives.

202
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.300
Notice, he says a servant of God an apostle of

203
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.800
Jesus Christ. This is God's elect. God never

204
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.000
lies. God promised to turn a life.

205
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.800
God revealed salvation at the right time. God commanded

206
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.400
Paul to preach. God gives Grace and peace.

207
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.900
This is first and foremost about him.

208
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.300
Something that's true actually of all of

209
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.900
God's word.

210
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.200
That it's not just an instruction manual for

211
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:01.500
life.

212
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.400
It's not just a collection of good stories.

213
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.300
This is God revealing himself to us.

214
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.900
God telling us about who he is

215
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.900
his character his work his salvation. This

216
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.900
is this is about him first.

217
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.200
That should be your primary perspective anytime you come

218
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.800
to God's word.

219
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.100
Not looking in it for what it tells you

220
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.300
about your issue tell it should be first and foremost

221
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.900
about what it tells you about him. What does it teach you about God?

222
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.700
This should be your first question.

223
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.700
And that properly orders the rest of those issues below that.

224
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.500
So the main character here is God. We'll see him do his work

225
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.400
in Titus the second player in this

226
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.300
letter then is

227
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.400
the church

228
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.100
the church again a little little tricky.

229
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.700
I'm getting you in a second, but but in

230
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.300
spite of Paul putting his name first.

231
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.500
Notice again. What verse 1 says

232
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.200
Anytime you see this is grammar school here for a

233
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.900
second you get those commas those Mark something off.

234
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.000
So he says Paul comma a servant of God an apostle of Jesus

235
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.000
Christ comma take that section out for a second

236
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.500
because it's just describing Paul take that out and notice the

237
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.000
way it then says it.

238
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.000
It says Paul.

239
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.300
For the sake of the faith of God's elect.

240
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.600
4 is the reason he wrote It's a because

241
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.300
kind of word for the sake of the faith of

242
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.600
God's elect. Who is he talking about?

243
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.400
I'm at the church.

244
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.700
He's talking about the the phrase God's

245
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.500
elect involves individuals. Yes that

246
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.300
God is individually choosing but the elect are

247
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.100
then made into what we call corporate singular.

248
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.900
That it's a bunch of ones grouped

249
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.100
together as one.

250
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.800
The elect it's exactly how second John says

251
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.100
it that letter was written to the

252
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.900
elect lady and her children.

253
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.800
Who's the elect lady? That's the church? It's a corporate singular

254
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.800
idea.

255
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.300
Made up of individual members. Yes, all chosen

256
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.200
made his very own from before the

257
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.000
foundation of the world. This passage says that's that's what we're

258
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.900
talking about. When we say the elect. It's the individuals making

259
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.500
up the whole.

260
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.200
And so he's writing this for them.

261
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.500
He's writing it to Titus. Yes, but he's writing this letter for the

262
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.300
sake of the church. And so we're going to see throughout this

263
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.600
letter how this church and how all churches

264
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.900
in some way are supposed to function.

265
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.400
How how we function what stands for how it acts

266
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.200
how it's structured we're going to see all of that that Paul is

267
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.300
instructing Titus how to start a church how to revitalize or

268
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.500
replant or grow a church.

269
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.500
see Paul knew

270
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.600
the church is the bride of Christ.

271
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.500
And so he cared deeply that this

272
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.100
church Titus is working. These churches tied us working

273
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.400
when that that it would be God's Church God's way.

274
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.900
That's what he wanted.

275
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.100
It's like this is God's deal. This is not our deal.

276
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.600
Don't think of it that you can make it happen this way. It's God's church. So

277
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.800
do it his way. We should care the same way, right?

278
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.800
We should care about the way the church is handled.

279
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.700
as Paul did

280
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.300
Now the third player in this letter, I've already mentioned a number of

281
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:37.700
times.

282
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.600
And you might get this one right? This actually is Paul Paul is

283
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.800
the third player in this letter.

284
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.400
Now he describes himself something here in verse 1.

285
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.900
He says he's a servant of God and an

286
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.000
apostle of Jesus Christ.

287
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.400
Now this is going back to the process of God's saving him

288
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.600
and calling him to the ministry. He's referencing that

289
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:01.900
here.

290
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.000
I encourage you to go back and read at least Acts chapter 9 sometime

291
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.900
later today where this Apostle formerly

292
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.200
known as Saul where he was headed to

293
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.000
Damascus.

294
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.900
to imprison and even kill Christians

295
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.600
He was a zealous Jew and he was thinking he was doing God's work

296
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.600
by going to persecute Christians yet

297
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.000
Jesus.

298
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.700
Who had weeks earlier than crucified resurrected

299
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.900
and ascended back to heaven?

300
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.400
He met Saul on that road.

301
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.700
And completely transformed his life.

302
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.900
completely changed everything

303
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.700
and it was that guy it was Saul back

304
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.300
then it was that guy who God Called to preach

305
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.500
to be an apostle to be an authority figure in

306
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.200
the early church. That was the guy but it

307
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.800
wasn't just that God called this new Paul to Ministry.

308
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.400
It was that he even saved him.

309
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.200
And Paul never got over that.

310
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.400
Because he looked back he knew who he was Paul never

311
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.400
got over that. Here's how he described it in his own words

312
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.200
and 1st Timothy chapter 1 verses 12

313
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:12.900
through 17.

314
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.900
This is Paul's testimony. He says I thank him who

315
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.100
has given me strength Christ Jesus our lord because

316
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.600
he judged me faithful appointing me

317
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.500
to his service.

318
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.200
The formerly I was a blasphemer meaning I spoke

319
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.800
ill of Jesus. I was persecutor an insolent

320
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.900
opponent angry.

321
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.300
But I received Mercy because I'd acted ignorantly and

322
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.200
unbelief.

323
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.400
And the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith

324
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.900
and love that are in Christ Jesus.

325
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.300
The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance that

326
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.500
Christ. Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of

327
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.700
whom I'm the foremost.

328
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.500
But I received Mercy for this reason that in

329
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.600
me as the foremost Jesus Christ might display

330
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.100
his perfect patience.

331
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.400
As an example to those who were

332
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.900
to believe in him for eternal life.

333
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.900
Then he can't stop but worship to the king of the ages Immortal

334
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.300
invisible the only God be honor

335
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.800
and Glory forever and ever. Amen.

336
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.200
Right. You see here how stunned Paul was

337
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.100
over God's grace.

338
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.000
Right Paul, that's why he he in Titus

339
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.800
one one. That's why he refers to himself

340
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.900
as a servant of God.

341
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.100
In fact, that's the Greek word doulas which

342
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.000
can be slave as well.

343
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.400
But when you hear slave don't think chattel slavery in

344
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.800
America and history the unfortunate sad wrong

345
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.500
thing that that was think here more of like a bond

346
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.000
servant.

347
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.200
So way he's using it where we're a servant could willingly commit

348
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.400
to their master.

349
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.300
For whatever reason they were serving that person but they

350
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.400
could willingly choose to say I want to follow you.

351
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.500
I want to commit to you forever.

352
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.800
They would only do that though if that Master was good, right?

353
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.400
If they were loved and cared for and treated well, that's why

354
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.100
they would choose to say I want to serve you always it

355
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.400
was them seeing that Master as better

356
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.300
than anything else they could find.

357
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.500
Kind of like what Peter said to Jesus in John

358
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:30.800
6.

359
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.900
68 and 69

360
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.300
Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go?

361
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.100
You have the words of eternal life.

362
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.100
And we have believed and have come to

363
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.600
know that you are the Holy One of God.

364
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.100
To whom shall we go?

365
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.300
So Paul he looked at his history.

366
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.900
He knew how far from God he actually was.

367
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.700
and then he looked

368
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.000
at what God had done for him.

369
00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.900
And he said okay God, I'm all yours.

370
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.300
Whenever Wherever however, I'm yours. I'll

371
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.200
go wherever you want me to go. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I don't

372
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.800
care the cost. I'm Yours.

373
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.600
Look at what you've done.

374
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.200
Do you have that same kind of perspective?

375
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.100
Do you do you truly recognize what you've been saved from?

376
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.600
Do you see it as a privilege?

377
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.100
That even if he would ask you to suffer for him, he's called

378
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.200
you.

379
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.400
Now I know most of you most were probably not out there

380
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.300
trying to persecute and kill Christians. I know that's probably

381
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.600
not most of our stories in this room.

382
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.700
But do you remember that your sin puts you on a pathway

383
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.800
to separation from God forever?

384
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.200
And you could do nothing about it.

385
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.900
You couldn't be good enough. You couldn't earn any way out of it.

386
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.400
Do you remember that?

387
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.400
Do you remember though also that God by his grace not

388
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.200
even deserved in any way

389
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.300
he reached into the darkness and gave you the Light of

390
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:30.700
Christ.

391
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.800
Do you remember the his saving work in your place that

392
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.300
he lived perfectly he died substitutionally

393
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.100
and he rose victoriously to

394
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.500
purchase your salvation.

395
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.900
Like do you remember that that's the only way it would work?

396
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.300
And he did it because he loved you.

397
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.600
Maybe you've never believed that.

398
00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.800
Maybe maybe you've never given your life to Jesus like

399
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.100
this.

400
00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.900
Why wouldn't you?

401
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.300
Why wouldn't you do that? Why wouldn't you see, you know,

402
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.300
you're a sinner, you know that you've tried these things. It doesn't

403
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:12.600
work, right?

404
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.700
Why wouldn't you see this is the offer of Jesus.

405
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.100
save you

406
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.500
for you to see his grace and to run away from your

407
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.800
sin and run to him.

408
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:26.800
and be saved

409
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.600
don't ever forget what he's done friends.

410
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.100
That's why the constant drumbeat of

411
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.600
our church of our songs of the sermons of

412
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.000
the less is the gospel.

413
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.900
The drumbeat of just constant reminders of

414
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.600
how far we've come from that to this.

415
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.400
by his grace

416
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.100
death to life Darkness to light the whole thing.

417
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.000
Is Grace it's given it to us?

418
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.400
Let's never forget that.

419
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.400
Because that should change everything.

420
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.700
But there's one more player here in this letter.

421
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.500
God the church Paul the fourth

422
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.400
is the one whose name it Bears Titus.

423
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.800
Now, what do we know about Titus?

424
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.500
Honestly, we don't know much about his background. He's not mentioned

425
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.400
a whole lot about his story. But but what

426
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.000
we do know is that he was a gentile non-jew convert

427
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.300
probably of Paul.

428
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.400
And he was most likely involved in Acts 15 when there's

429
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.100
this Council in Jerusalem where they're deciding about

430
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.100
circumcision and salvation. And how do we bring in

431
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.300
these these non-jewish people. How do we make that all work? Do

432
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.300
they have to be circumcised to be saved? You have to become Jewish to be saved

433
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.100
Titus was most likely there because you

434
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.300
read Galatians Chapter 2 sometime later today and you hear the

435
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.000
story of Titus standing firm for his beliefs that

436
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.100
the gospel doesn't involve works at all.

437
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.100
So Titus is probably in that setting as close

438
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.300
to Paul. But we also know that Paul

439
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.100
was heavily involved or Titus was heavily involved in Paul's Ministry through the years.

440
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.300
We see him all over the letters that he served the church

441
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.100
at Corinth.

442
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.500
And then he reported back to Paul and then then Paul wrote

443
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.600
what we now know a second Corinthians and Titus hand

444
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.400
delivered it back to Corinth and then began collecting the

445
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.800
offering that they would take back to Jerusalem.

446
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.400
trusted worker

447
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.100
even during Paul's imprisonment in Rome

448
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.100
Titus was there.

449
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.100
And Paul sent Titus to share the gospel in what? We

450
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.300
now know as Eastern Europe.

451
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.400
And so Titus faithful worker because of what God done

452
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.200
in his life.

453
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.100
Paul trusted him

454
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.600
not only did he trust him to work though. You see Titus and

455
00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.700
Paul were so close.

456
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.700
Because did you see in verse 4 Paul calls Titus

457
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.900
my true child.

458
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.900
They weren't biological.

459
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.100
But spiritual connection can often be even closer than biological connections,

460
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.400
right?

461
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.600
But my true child that means that means Titus was known

462
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.700
by Paul.

463
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.100
Paul was known by Titus they shared this intimate Connection

464
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.700
in the gospel. How did

465
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.100
they get there? How did they get to that kind of a level

466
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.900
of depth in their relationship?

467
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.300
Well, they spent a bunch of time together.

468
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.100
Traveling sharing the gospel. They spent a bunch

469
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.900
of time together. They they serve together and in gospel Ministry

470
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.700
and all kinds of different ways Paul invested in

471
00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.300
Titus. He poured his life into Titus and

472
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.000
they became close because of that.

473
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.600
Listen, I know what times it might be risky.

474
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.100
But you will never be known.

475
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.900
If you're never around other believers.

476
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.200
And I'm not just talking about sitting in rows like this because you're not technically around

477
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.600
each other until you're really involved

478
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.600
in in like circles not

479
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.000
in rows.

480
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.700
Like you're in a group you're talking you're engaging in relationship.

481
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.400
You can't be known if you just come in here and disappear right even better than that. There's

482
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.200
there's further steps you you might even go on a mission

483
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.000
trip together and serve you might even start to teach a group

484
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.400
of kids together on Sundays or Mondays or

485
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.100
you might you might rap burritos in the

486
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.400
cafe together or go visit the homebound together and

487
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.400
and let me just tell you how close you get when you start serving

488
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.200
together with people.

489
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.400
You walk on a mission trip. You don't know anybody on that

490
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.200
team and all the sudden you walk away at the end of the week and you are

491
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:54.800
like best friends.

492
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.400
Because the gospel service.

493
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.100
Nits you together.

494
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.800
So those are ways to be to be known.

495
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.600
But even further than that.

496
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.000
Do you have anyone in your life that you would be

497
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.100
able to call your child in the

498
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:14.500
faith?

499
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.900
Someone that you have helped mature and grow up in

500
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.000
their faith. You have anybody in there?

501
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.000
and listen any age can do this

502
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.600
any of us any age can do this poor into

503
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.600
somebody else, but I want you to hear me in this older Generations.

504
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.500
We need you.

505
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.200
We need you.

506
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.300
to be spiritual fathers and spiritual mothers

507
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.500
To step up to this call to what Paul was

508
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.400
doing with Titus because many in my generation and Below

509
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.800
never have had that.

510
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.300
And yet We crave it. There's people who

511
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.300
desire it and want somebody to point because their dad

512
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.200
didn't or their mom didn't and they want somebody they don't know their

513
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.300
grandparents. They want somebody to pour into their life and

514
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.500
and you can step into that and fill that gap for people

515
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.600
in our church.

516
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.400
You can invest your life. You can pour your life into

517
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.900
them. You can teach them how to follow Jesus.

518
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.200
You can do that individually, of course, but you can even do that together as a

519
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.200
group. What if we started shuffling a deck a little bit and you

520
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.400
senior adults on your Tuesday night dinners, you start inviting college

521
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.000
students to come.

522
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.200
There you go. Let's call it over there. Yeah free

523
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.400
food.

524
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.800
No, but seriously, what what happened?

525
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.100
And you just start saying hey come come around us and they start

526
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.000
to watch what it looks like to follow Jesus for 70 years.

527
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.800
Who knows just think?

528
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.600
What if we had a bunch of Paul and Titus type relationships all

529
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.400
over this church?

530
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.500
Or this kind of stuff. We've already got the structure. Listen, we've

531
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.700
already got what we need structurally. We've got mentoring we

532
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.200
got these micro groups that that Phil help lead us

533
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.200
through and we've been developing over the last couple years, right? We've got

534
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.100
these things. All you have to do is ask we can give you some formats give you some

535
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.500
ways. It's not too complicated and listen women. This is

536
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.500
not just for men don't think Paul Titus is only pastoral stuff

537
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.100
like this. You can do the same. In fact Titus too. We'll see

538
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.100
we'll command you to do this women.

539
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.300
This is for all of us.

540
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.100
But that's what we believe God's vision is for this church.

541
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.700
To glorify God by becoming a hub for an all ages

542
00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.000
disciple making movement.

543
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.400
Where this thing the gospel in our

544
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.300
lives just gets replicated and multiplied and expanded as

545
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.900
we locally and globally

546
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.200
go.

547
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.300
We have a value called intentional disciple making here it

548
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.400
fits right along with this.

549
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.300
We're part of disciple making is teaching someone else

550
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.500
how to obey Jesus's commands.

551
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.200
Not just teach them commands but teach them how to

552
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.200
obey his commands and you might sit there

553
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.400
and you feel so inadequate for that task.

554
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.400
That no one would care what you think because you don't

555
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.400
know the the Bible like everybody else does and and

556
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.800
all those things. Listen, that's not true.

557
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.300
Do you see don't don't forget this don't forget

558
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.000
who God was using here in Titus.

559
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:35.400
Paul

560
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.300
Who was a persecutor of the church?

561
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.000
Just a couple years before that.

562
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.400
Titus

563
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.200
a gentile

564
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.300
Right. God was using these kinds of people he can use you.

565
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.300
And don't overcomplicate this so you yeah, you might not know the Bible as

566
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.400
much as someone else. Are you trying to live it out?

567
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.400
Are you trying to live the Bible out? Yes. Well, so just

568
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.800
show someone else how to do that.

569
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.300
Share your life experiences about what worked and what didn't

570
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:13.500
work.

571
00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.300
Talk about the situation they're facing and use your

572
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.600
wisdom that God's given you over the decades to show how you

573
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.400
can handle that when it failed when

574
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.200
it worked.

575
00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.200
I mean just think we know this inherently the best way to learn how to shoot a

576
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:28.700
basketball.

577
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.700
Is not to go read a book on it.

578
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.200
Is to sit there and watch someone do it have them coach you through

579
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.600
it how to hold your hand how to look at this how to get your right you

580
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.000
watch and you learn and you experience with

581
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.200
someone that's the best way to learn how to do it.

582
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.500
That's why they have residencies and medical school, right? You don't just go

583
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.000
through school and learn the books and then go do surgery, right you have

584
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.300
to watch and learn and practice and all that. That's how this works in disciple

585
00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:56.800
making as well.

586
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.800
Listen, if each one of us would take seriously the

587
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.600
command of Jesus to Go Make Disciples of

588
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.500
our neighborhoods and of the Nations lives would

589
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:08.700
change.

590
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.600
We'd see a bunch more Sauls becoming Paul's all

591
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.700
over our lives.

592
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.400
Our own lives would change because now you've

593
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.700
stepped forward into the mission and purpose of God in

594
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.300
his creation. You would see some things

595
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.300
happen in your life.

596
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.700
And then we'd see even more titus's.

597
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.300
Go and plant and replant churches all over our city all

598
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.100
over the nation all over the world.

599
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:41.900
things would happen

600
00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.300
so you can see that there's a lot of depth to the players in

601
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.200
this short letter from Paul to Titus.

602
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.200
To know who these people were what they

603
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.700
were doing how they were living that really helps us understand the background

604
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.000
here.

605
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.000
But then we need to know as we jump into this. What does this book even about?

606
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.200
Hinted a few things already. But what's the main point? What

607
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.500
are the things that God wants us to learn from this?

608
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.700
Well first this book this letter is about God's truth

609
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.600
first and foremost.

610
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.500
Like I said the main characters God it's about his truth.

611
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.200
Notice in verse 1 Paul wrote this letter to help the church's

612
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.600
faith.

613
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.400
And it says their knowledge of the truth.

614
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.400
What truths he talking about?

615
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.400
Talking about God's truth the truth about the

616
00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:39.500
gospel.

617
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.200
This eternal life that that God had promised from

618
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.700
eternity past. He's wanting them to understand and know

619
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.600
more about that the truth that God entrusted Paul to

620
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.300
Proclaim here in verse 3. He's like, this

621
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.800
is what I want you to tell everybody Paul go do it Faithfully. It's

622
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.400
the gospel.

623
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.300
And we know that that Grace and peace verse 4

624
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.300
says is that it is the truth. We know that it's

625
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.100
the truth because

626
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.500
verse 2 says God never lies.

627
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.600
Never lies.

628
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.900
That's literally the word the way it says that they're

629
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.600
The the way who the one

630
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.400
who never lies God is kind of how the Greek actually says it.

631
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.200
It's the the adjective describing God is that he

632
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.100
never lies now that's in contrast to our enemy.

633
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.000
the father of Lies

634
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.400
who Jesus says in John 8:44 does not stand

635
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.200
in the truth because there is no truth in him.

636
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:43.900
so we've got the

637
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.100
the one who can't tell the truth and we

638
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.200
got the one who cannot lie.

639
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.400
John 8:44 says that's the enemy but Jesus on

640
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.400
the other hand John 14:6. Jesus is the truth.

641
00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.000
Not Paul Pierce, no matter what Shaq says. It says

642
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.900
our God is the truth.

643
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.500
In and of himself, he is the truth. That's that's who

644
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.200
he is. Not just that he speaks truth. He

645
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.800
is truth.

646
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.800
Meaning we must submit to what he says.

647
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.600
Rather than what we prefer what we think is right we submit

648
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.600
to the truth.

649
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.500
But that's thankfully what Paul also included in this letter to Titus

650
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.600
is not only God's truth. But also our response to that.

651
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.300
What should our response be?

652
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.500
When we read God's word as we hear and

653
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.200
learn What God Says, how should we respond?

654
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.200
James 1 says to be doers of the word not hearers only

655
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.200
that's what we want to be about.

656
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.300
Well, the first way we see we should respond is in the church. This is again

657
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.900
a letter written to a church.

658
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.600
So that's one major aspect of this book.

659
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.200
How that that his very own idea how that plays out

660
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.400
corporately how it plays out as a group. What does

661
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.000
it mean for the church? What is this together look

662
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.200
like

663
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.200
because Paul wrote this to Titus with

664
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.000
the church in his viewfinder.

665
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.100
He was looking at the church. He wanted

666
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.900
their faith to grow. He wanted their knowledge of God's truth to align

667
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.500
with the certainty that they had in this eternal

668
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.200
life. God promise.

669
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.700
He's like God. This is what you believe guys. So so why

670
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.400
don't you align your life with it now?

671
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.500
Here's how you do that even more here's how you align the church with it

672
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.400
even more. And so what that means for us today is we'll

673
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.700
see through the next few weeks. Is that that since

674
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.800
our church is his very own.

675
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.000
That means it's no one else's.

676
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.000
Jesus is the head of this church.

677
00:35:59.100 --> 00:35:59.600
Not me.

678
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:01.900
Not the elders.

679
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.600
Not you, not your group. Nothing. No one

680
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.900
but him we all me Elders

681
00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.300
everyone all of us. We serve him

682
00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:11.900
together.

683
00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.200
He's the head. He's the one calling the shots directing this

684
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.200
which means that should change the way we do things around here.

685
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.300
Maybe we're on track with that. Maybe we need to be tweaked a

686
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.100
little bit by what God's word says and so we need to be humble as

687
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.200
we come to this, but this should be the perspective.

688
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.100
What does God say we should be about as a church?

689
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.900
But not only does Titus talk about the church as a whole.

690
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.700
He says you also need to respond to God's

691
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.100
word in godliness.

692
00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.700
individually

693
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.800
You saw it in verse 1.

694
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.400
This truth that Paul and Titus

695
00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.100
were proclaiming God's truth. It says it Accords with

696
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.800
godliness.

697
00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.200
And the only word I can think of is the accordion right that thing is

698
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.300
according with right it goes together

699
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.200
with I don't know if that has any relevance but I can't get out of my head

700
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.900
now, but it means what the word means.

701
00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:20.200
Is that the truth goes with godliness it

702
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.200
Accords with it. It matches up it

703
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:22.800
goes together.

704
00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.400
What he's saying is that this truth, he's proclaiming God's truth

705
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.300
shows them how to live shows them

706
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.500
how to live pure set apart lives

707
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.400
that are different than the world that their morality looks different

708
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.600
their action thoughts look different.

709
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.400
That means that as you know more about Jesus you

710
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.100
then live more like Jesus.

711
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.200
Like these things go together truth and action knowledge

712
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.500
is not enough we must act

713
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.000
on it.

714
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.200
Been said that godliness or this morality that godliness is

715
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.600
the visible emblem of one's genuine relationship

716
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.200
to God.

717
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.400
This is how we know.

718
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.300
so listen, Maybe

719
00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.600
maybe you don't need another Bible study.

720
00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.400
Maybe you need to go back and start living out the one you just finished.

721
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.000
Right. You see that? That's what it's the point is the point is not just

722
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.400
knowledge and growing and growing and growing and knowledge and knowledge and expanding our

723
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.300
brains. The point is that it actually fits into our lives

724
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.400
and changes our hearts.

725
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.600
That's what God wants for us. That's why he's telling us the

726
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:40.900
truth.

727
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.400
Because think about this if you've been chosen by God

728
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.200
to be his very own.

729
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.800
If you have been granted the gift of the hope

730
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.500
of eternal life.

731
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.400
And that's all done through the work of Jesus in

732
00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.200
your place.

733
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.100
What are the response should you give?

734
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.100
Like Paul look back and he said how could I

735
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.800
ever do anything? But just say to Jesus, I'm all yours.

736
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.600
Like you believe or listen you are his you

737
00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.600
are known you are loved.

738
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.800
That means you're safe.

739
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.100
That means you have a future hope that is

740
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:24.800
secure.

741
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.100
Not by anything you did or deserved you are his so

742
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.200
what can anyone do to you?

743
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.200
What what can anyone do to nothing he Romans

744
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.400
8 nothing can separate you from his love

745
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.400
so you are now free to serve him

746
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.600
with everything you are with your whole life

747
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.000
to just say Jesus. I'm all yours. What do you want?

748
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.700
Here, this is what I'm doing. Right this Jesus. This

749
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.400
is what I want is to follow you. There's no

750
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.600
other reason I can but by your strength anyway,

751
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.100
so I'm all yours. We sing that

752
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.400
song every once in a while right that the breath in my lungs you

753
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.500
gave that to me. So why would I use it for anything

754
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.100
but praise and worship to you?

755
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.400
see church, that's

756
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.400
That's what a gospel-centered church is intended to

757
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:18.600
produce.

758
00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.300
A church that's focused on Jesus and his work

759
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.600
in our place. That's the kind of attitude and

760
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.400
people it's intended to produce. That's

761
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.600
what God wants the fruit of his work

762
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.100
to be.

763
00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.100
this body of people

764
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.600
Who are his very own?

765
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.000
Who look more and more like Jesus every day?

766
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.700
That's the whole goal.

767
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.100
Because of what he's done, we all progressively look

768
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.800
more like him.

769
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.300
Titus will show that to us

770
00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.700
and let's be that kind of church.

771
00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.400
Let's be those kind of people.

772
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.000
Because God gets Glory from that more than ever before.
