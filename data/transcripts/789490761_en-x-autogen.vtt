1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.800
For the grace of God offers salvation

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.400
to all people teaching us

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.700
to live Godly life.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.500
Jesus gave himself for us to redeem us

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.400
and to purify for himself a

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.200
people that are his very own.

7
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.500
We praise the Lamb who takes away our sin. Amen.

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.100
I was beautiful. Thank you worship team. Good

9
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.400
morning everyone. My name is Ryan Whitaker and

10
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.200
it's a joy a real joy to serve as one of

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.500
your elders and it is so good to see everyone

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.600

13
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.400

front of you. There are QR codes. Please reach

out to us. We'd love to say hello to you.

16
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.200
So let's do something fun here.

17
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's go back in time together and it's August.

18
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.700
It's 1996 Andre.

19
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.600
Agassi had just

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
won gold at the Atlanta Olympics.

21
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.500
And Bill Clinton is in the White House Ross Perot.

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.600
Bob Dole. They're in the race for that people are

23
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.400
barely surfing the world wide web

24
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.200
on AOL and dial-up.

25
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.800
And LeAnn Rimes. She just released

26
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.200
her first album.

27
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.700
And Grunge music is still in.

28
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.900
in many of the women in here

29
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.200
were rocking the Rachel haircut

30
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.200
and maybe maybe you still are.

31
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.400
No judgment here and many

32
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.300
of us guys. We had a lot more here back then

33
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.600
too. It was the good old days, right?

34
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.400
August 1996 is also when we as

35
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.100
a church decided to change to

36
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.200
eldership as our pastoral Leadership

37
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.600
Model.

38
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.800
As we saw in clear guidance of scripture now,

39
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.100
some never gets old is following

40
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.000
scripture.

41
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.900
And you're always in the good old days when you do.

42
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.700
Now here's a question for you. Why would we change horses Midstream

43
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.300
as Dr. Rice says

44
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.300
from a model where a senior pastor is

45
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.900
the leader over everything?

46
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.000
To one where Elders a group of

47
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.900
Elders leads the church.

48
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.600
Well stay tuned today because today's passage

49
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.400
is pivotal toward that decision and

50
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.100
we'll see that as we go now if you

51
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.200
will turn in your Bibles with me to Titus Chapter

52
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.600
1.

53
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.000
And if your Bible is like a progress bar then

54
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.800
Titus is at about the 95% Mark

55
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.300
and it's right before Philemon and

56
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.000
Hebrews.

57
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.600
But while you're turning there last week John introduced us well to

58
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.300
the book Titus. This is a letter written by

59
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.700
the Apostle Paul to his coworker to

60
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.700
his disciple Titus who

61
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.600
is increte and Crete is an extensive

62
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.200
Island in center of the Mediterranean and

63
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.700
there are a string of

64
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.700
church plants there.

65
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.700
And that is the context now as we

66
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.900
as a church continue to read through Titus.

67
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.500
Let's not lose the Wonder of what we read in

68
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.800
here.

69
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.300
Because Titus 2:14 says that we Believers are

70
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.700
a purified people for

71
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.000
his own possession.

72
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.800
That's right. We are nothing less than his

73
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.900
very own.

74
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.600
praise God

75
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.100
praise God

76
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.800
In fact, that's the name of this new series his very

77
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.000
own.

78
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.400
And that we are his very own should change everything about

79
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.200
how we live everything.

80
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.000
And we'll see that here.

81
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.100
It certainly changed everything for Titus.

82
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.400
He devoted his life to gospel Ministry,

83
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.100
especially on the

84
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.400
island of Crete.

85
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.600
And we'll see why that was such a sacrifice for

86
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.900
him next week.

87
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.700
Now Paul had set the stage for these

88
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.400
young churches.

89
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.200
And Paul is now giving his first instructions

90
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.500
his top priority instructions to

91
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.900
Young Titus.

92
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.800
He set the stage and he left Titus as

93
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.000
the casting director of sorts.

94
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.900
to appoint elders

95
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.900
So let's read now Titus 1 verses 5 through

96
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.400
9.

97
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.200
This is why I left you in Crete so that you might

98
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.300
put what remained into order.

99
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.300
And appoint Elders in every town as I

100
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.900
directed you if anyone is above reproach.

101
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.800
The husband of one wife his children are believers

102
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.900
and not open to the charge of debauchery

103
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.900
or insubordination.

104
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.600
For an overseer as God's Steward must

105
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.800
be above reproach.

106
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.700
He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or

107
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.800
a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain but

108
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.000
hospitable.

109
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.700
a lover of good self-controlled upright

110
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.900
holy and disciplined

111
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.600
He must hold firm to the trustworthy word

112
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.500
as taught so that he may be able to give instruction and

113
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.400
sound Doctrine and also to rebuke those

114
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.100
who contradict it.

115
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.400
And that is the word of the Lord for us

116
00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.700
today.

117
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.100
Now before we dig into that.

118
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.900
We need God's help. Let's pray.

119
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.600
Father our hearts cry is to

120
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.000
be known.

121
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.000
and to be shepherded

122
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.100
So we need you lead us feed us care for

123
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.200
us protect us.

124
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.400
I ask that you help me over the next few minutes and we

125
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.900
ask that you draw people to yourself even.

126
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.100
today

127
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.400
come in power. Help me to speak only what's in your holy word

128
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.200
in Christ's name. We pray. Amen.

129
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.800
We can see that today's passage is about church

130
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.400
elders.

131
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.900
Paul tells Tinus from the get-go to put Elders or

132
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.300
leaders into place.

133
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.500
And to make sure that these men are living lives

134
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.700
that reflect the awesome reality

135
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.300
that we are Jesus very own.

136
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.000
and so

137
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.300
as we read through we'll let this passage surface a

138
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.000
bunch of questions for us. And the way these questions will look it's

139
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.900
kind of like a frequently asked questions of sorts or

140
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.100
even a catechism.

141
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.500
We'll start with these seven questions about Elders that

142
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.100
you've always wanted to ask.

143
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.300
Though maybe this will open up 7,000

144
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.100
other questions for you.

145
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.300
And that's fantastic. We would love to

146
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.900
hear your questions talk to us after the service snag

147
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.500
us in the hallways email us Elders at

148
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.500
hhbc.com.

149
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.200
Or come to one of our meetings.

150
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.500
This last year. We had a whole group of high

151
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.800
school boys visit us at council meeting.

152
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.700
And it was so good. It was such a blessing for

153
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.600
us to hear these boys pray.

154
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.100
in full Trust of God's goodness

155
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.400
And it was a comforting thing to me to see that the next

156
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.400
generation of God's church is in good hands.

157
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.000
Amen.

158
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.900
After you hear this sermon is about Elders the very first question you might

159
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.500
ask is.

160
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.400
How does this even matter from?

161
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.800
How does this even matter for me?

162
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.300
Because I'm not an elder or I don't know anybody who is an

163
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.500
elder or I'm hurting in some

164
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.700
way. I've lost something or someone.

165
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.400
or if your student

166
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.000
you may feel alone.

167
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.700
But hang with me, I think that you'll see in today's passage

168
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.500
that Christ cares for

169
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.400
his church the the bride of

170
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.900
Christ so much.

171
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.700
Through the institution institution of eldership.

172
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.600
Which does for any number

173
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.500
of things but also is there to precisely care for

174
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.300
you exactly when?

175
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.100
The waves are crashing against you.

176
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.100
And we'll see that.

177
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.600
To put it to put it simply Christ cares so much

178
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.000
for his church that he demands

179
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.600
Godly Elders be put in place.

180
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.800
for his glory and for your good

181
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.000
I'll say it again Christ cares for his church so much

182
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.600
that he demands Godly Elders put

183
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.300
in place for his glory and for your

184
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:26.900
good.

185
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.200
That's our main point. We'll see it as we go today.

186
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.500
Let's dig into these verses. Let's start by looking at verse

187
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.100
5 together.

188
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.900
Paul reminds Titus what his purpose is

189
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.200
This is why I left you in Crete so that you may

190
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.700
put what remained into order.

191
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.600
You know, it's good to be reminded because we all forget so

192
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.300
easily.

193
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.800
It's been said the only thing faster than the

194
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.900
speed of thought is the speed of

195
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.700
forgetting.

196
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.400
And that quote of course was said by.

197
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.200
none other than

198
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.500
the one and only

199
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.200
I forget who said that really so but that is

200
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.100
that is why?

201
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.900
We need to be reminded of our purpose here our mission

202
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.300
here.

203
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.600
It's our purpose. Imagine for a moment. Paul is

204
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.900
standing up here on stage and to

205
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.200
borrow from the style that he uses for verse 5.

206
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.900
He says to us. This is why

207
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.300
you are at Henderson Hills.

208
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:41.700
so that you might

209
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.400
equip one another to love Jesus and to

210
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.600
live sent.

211
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.900
for Titus

212
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.300
Paul is saying this is why I left you in

213
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:52.500
Crete.

214
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.900
So that you might put what remained into order and a

215
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.500
point elders.

216
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.600
And this Greek word for putting into order?

217
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.900
Has that has the root ortho in

218
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.000
it.

219
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.200
And that's where we get the word Orthopedics.

220
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.900
To set your bones straight to put your bones into order.

221
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.400
It's also where we get the word orthodontist. So to

222
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.300
set your teeth straight.

223
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.200
To set your teeth into order.

224
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.100
One day when I was a teenager.

225
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.600
I went to the orthodontist with my mom. I

226
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.600
guess I needed braces.

227
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.400
And I'm sitting there in reclined in that pleather exam

228
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.700
chair.

229
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.000
And the orthodontist he says to me.

230
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.300
Ryan

231
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.500
I discovered.

232
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.600
one of your teeth

233
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.300
Is smack dab?

234
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.500
Buried center of the roof of

235
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:53.800
your mouth.

236
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.700
And as a side note, we learned this year that

237
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.500
I've passed the same phenomenon onto one

238
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.100
of my sons.

239
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.600
And he he jokingly calls it his roof

240
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.700
tooth.

241
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.500
That's right his roof tooth with an F.

242
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.600
So for me, they attached a wire

243
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.700
to my roof tooth.

244
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.400
And they slowly over the course of several weeks.

245
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.000
They slowly dragged it into place.

246
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.400
And they literally put my teeth

247
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.000
into order.

248
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.200
No longer was there to be a one tooth

249
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.600
Island.

250
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.100
Now in the text today Paul has left Titus in Crete.

251
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.200
To not put bones or teeth into order

252
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.600
but to put nothing less than the

253
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.100
church.

254
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.100
into order

255
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.300
So as we see in verse 5 in putting the church in

256
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.700
order, what is priority number one?

257
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.200
For churches what is priority number one for

258
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.600
churches?

259
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.500
That's right. You see it in the verse priority number one is to appoint

260
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.900
Elders or to put Elders in place.

261
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.900
Elders are the wire that pulls the church

262
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.200
together.

263
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.700
Paul has just given Titus the apostolic authority to

264
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.500
appoint Elders God in

265
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.200
his compassion for you. And for the

266
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.900
church has tasked Elders with responsibility for

267
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.500
the church.

268
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.500
Lest the church be like sheep without

269
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.400
a shepherd.

270
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.200
Because sheep can't survive without a shepherd.

271
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.100
now maybe

272
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.200
this kind of language rubs you

273
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.000
the wrong way.

274
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.400
And I get it.

275
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.400
Let's push a Biblical reset button

276
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.000
here.

277
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.200
Today you'll hear a lot of Shepherd and sheep language.

278
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.200
Let's be clear though sheep aren't dumb.

279
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.200
Sheep aren't dumb.

280
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.700
But they are beautifully dependent.

281
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.500
Well, we'd say is desperately dependent

282
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.900
The metaphor of sheep and Shepherd is one

283
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.200
of care and it isn't so much

284
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.400
about the Sheep as it is shining the spotlight on

285
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.400
the leading the feeding the caring and the protecting

286
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.700
by the Good Shepherd himself Jesus.

287
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.200
It's about him.

288
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.100
And so it's vitally a point important that we churches have

289
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.800
leaders.

290
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.000
And Elders as well. See today are the god-given

291
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.800
Pastoral leadership of the church.

292
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.300
and make no mistake Elders our sheep to

293
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.400
We are sheep too, and I'm speaking as an elder here,

294
00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.800
but we need the shepherding care of Jesus as much

295
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.500
as you do.

296
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.800
Also, if you look at the specific situation that Paul is speaking

297
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.400
into here.

298
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.500
They need to the need to appoint elders and create

299
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.100
is huge.

300
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.800
Because they are swimming in false teaching.

301
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.100
And maybe a better word for it is that they're drowning in false teaching?

302
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.900
And before you say, oh, that's Crete.

303
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.100
No.

304
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.600
We are swimming in false teaching. We're drowning

305
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.000
in false teaching. Do you

306
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.600
see that in today's culture?

307
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.500
And one of the elders Chief responsibilities is

308
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.800
to protect our church from that.

309
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.600
Protection is one of the ways that Christ cares for

310
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.300
his church.

311
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.500
through elders

312
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.800
Before we get too far, let's define some words together. So

313
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.500
we're speaking the same language. Let's do that by asking the

314
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.600
question. What are the other titles used

315
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.600
to describe Elders? What are the other titles used to

316
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.700
describe elders?

317
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.900
In scripture, we see the titles of Elder

318
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.200
pastor.

319
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.000
Shepherd and overseer

320
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.400
and all of these titles refer to the same

321
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.300
person.

322
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.100
They are interchangeable.

323
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.000
Yet each word offers insight into the different facets

324
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.800
or roles of the Elder just like

325
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.100
we refer to Jesus as Christ or

326
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.900
Good Shepherd or lamb like

327
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.700
we just sang.

328
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.200
And each of those describes a different facet of

329
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:45.900
who he is.

330
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.700
in a similar way

331
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.300
each of these titles describes a different

332
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.000
aspect of Elders

333
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.800
the main title that we see is elder.

334
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.000
Elder

335
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.000
so let's define that behind the Greek word that we

336
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.300
translate as Elder is presbyterus.

337
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.400
President that's all say presbyterus together.

338
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.400
presbyteras

339
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.400
we need a little bit a little bit more Greek Gusto here, but that's okay.

340
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.400
President Ross has used 70 times in the

341
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.000
New Testament.

342
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.100
And the term Elder has this connotation of those who are

343
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.200
usually older with wisdom and experience

344
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.800
and it carries with it respect and

345
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.400
admiration.

346
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.300
And you can hear some of that also in the Hebrew word for

347
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.100
Elder zocane.

348
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.600
And I hope you're not hoping for something.

349
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.000
A little bit more profound than this but the Hebrew word for

350
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.500
Elder literally means beard.

351
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.300
Let's continue with definitions a second word. We hear is

352
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.000
pastor pastor.

353
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.400
Now we've heard that Elder appears 70

354
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.400
times in the New Testament.

355
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.200
How many times does the word Pastor appear?

356
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.300
In the translation we used here the word

357
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.100
Pastor appears.

358
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:10.900
nowhere

359
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.300
It's nowhere.

360
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.400
But in Ephesians 4:11, that's the one passage in

361
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.600
Scripture that sometimes is translated to use the

362
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.100
English word Pastor where it says

363
00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.100
and he gave the apostles the prophets the

364
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.500
evangelists the Shepherds.

365
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.600
or pastors

366
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.400
To equip the Saints for the work of Ministry for building up

367
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.200
the body of Christ.

368
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.200
Shepherds has the same exact Greek word

369
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.700
as pastor.

370
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.200
or poemain poemain

371
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.500
Shepherds in this metaphor of

372
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.000
shepherdine shepherds lead sheep to

373
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.400
Green Pastures and to Still Waters to feed

374
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.400
and Shepherds oversee the flock to

375
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.600
make just make decisions that are in the best decision best interest

376
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600
of the Sheep.

377
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.400
We also see that Shepherds protect.

378
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.300
from wolves

379
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.300
The fourth word we see is overseer overseer. The

380
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.500
Greek word for this is episcopus and we see

381
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.000
this just a handful of times in the New Testament and the

382
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.600
title over to your highlights the management the supervision

383
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.100
responsibilities of the elders.

384
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.500
So we see many times in the Bible and we'll see it in today's text

385
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.100
even that the titles of Elder Shepherd

386
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.400
pastor and overseer are

387
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.700
interchangeable.

388
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.300
Because they all refer to the same person in today's

389
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.400
context see that and Elder is

390
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.800
a pastor.

391
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.900
An elder is a pastor.

392
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.400
Now that leads us to the question what do elders do?

393
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.300
What do elders do?

394
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.200
Now that we've defined the different titles for Elder we

395
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.100
can put these titles side by side.

396
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.400
on a string like like beads on a string

397
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.800
to understand what Elders do in short Elders lead

398
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.300
feet care for

399
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.000
and protect the church. You'll hear that a lot

400
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.500
today.

401
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.800
So, how do we Elders at Henderson Hills Shepherd the church? What

402
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.700
does it look like here for us?

403
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.200
While we do meet every couple weeks.

404
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.400
It's not in some dark secret.

405
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.200
With our vests on eating cookies, and we're making

406
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.500
arms length decisions.

407
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.200
That we do love cookies.

408
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.400
We do love cookies, but there's a lot more to it than those

409
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:47.900
meetings.

410
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.600
First from a high level we oversee major

411
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.300
Ministries.

412
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.400
and major staff decisions major initiatives

413
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.400
and we preach.

414
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.300
And we teach and we study God's word.

415
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.800
And we protect against doctrinal error and we defend.

416
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.200
We mentor and we disciple.

417
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.200
And we are mentored and we are discipled.

418
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.300
We get the joy and the thrill of

419
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.300
having people come in for prayer for healing like

420
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.700
we see in James 5.

421
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.600
Please come sometime and do this.

422
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.300
Grab one of us. We'd love to pray for you

423
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.800
expectantly that God can heal

424
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.100
you.

425
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.000
He can do it.

426
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.100
And he does it.

427
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.500
We'd love to do that.

428
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.900
We weep with those who weep and we Rejoice with

429
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.100
those who rejoice.

430
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.500
And we try our best to help restore broken

431
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.300
relationships.

432
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.400
Are we perfect at any of that?

433
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.200
No.

434
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.100
But by God's grace refined us even more

435
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.300
to Shepherd like Jesus.

436
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.400
And that is what Elders do.

437
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.200
This leads us to the next question.

438
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.400
Is the office of Elder the only one mentioned in the Bible is

439
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.200
the office of Elder the only one mentioned in the bible know

440
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.300
that the Bible mentions two offices.

441
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.000
In the Bible for leadership and service and it's

442
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.700
elders and deacons.

443
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.200
The word Deacon means helper or servant.

444
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.600
And it comes from two Greek words that literally means through the Dust.

445
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.700
or to kick up dust

446
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.200
and we see that deacons care for the Practical needs of the

447
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.900
church to allow Elders more time for prayer

448
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.300
and for teaching and for

449
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.100
leading.

450
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.800
In other words as David Platt says Elders are

451
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.100
the servant leaders of the church and deacons

452
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.900
are the leading Servants of

453
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.400
the church.

454
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.300
Here Henderson Hills, we praise God for the the over

455
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.200
80 deacons who serve in this way, especially

456
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.200
in their care for widows, but in so

457
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.600
many other Ministries.

458
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.300
And speaking of deacons today in fact is the

459
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:21.800
last day.

460
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.400
For making Deacon candidate recommendations. So if you know a man

461
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.400
who kicks up dust to serve

462
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.200
God in his people, please let us know out in

463
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.400
the information love in the in the lobby the information desk

464
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.700
there. We'd love to hear about these men.

465
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.000
So if we look back at today's passage where Titus is to appoint Elders,

466
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.900
why is Elders plural? Why

467
00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.600
is the word word Elders plural?

468
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.300
The answer is that God has designed the church

469
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.100
to be led by a plurality.

470
00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.800
or a group of Elders

471
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.400
and you can see another example of this with Paul

472
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.200
and Barnabas as

473
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.500
they're planting churches in Acts, 14:21 through

474
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:09.900
23.

475
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.800
When they had preached the gospel to that City and had

476
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.300
made many disciples. They returned to

477
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.800
lystra antiochonium and to Antioch and

478
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.100
when they had appointed elders.

479
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.100
plural

480
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.200
for them in every Church

481
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.400
with prayer and fasting and committed them to the Lord in whom they have believed.

482
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.400
So what does plurality look like at Henderson Hills?

483
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.900
Well on page one of our Elder manual.

484
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.700
There's one sentence in the middle of an otherwise

485
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.500
blank page and it says

486
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.400
we are a council of pastors of

487
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.200
which the lead teaching Pastor is

488
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.300
an equal mutually submitting to

489
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.100
one another in all areas of ministry.

490
00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.100
What does that mean?

491
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.200
It means that John is an elder and he

492
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.400
is an equal alongside the rest of us.

493
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.100
Now plurality makes things slower.

494
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.000
Sometimes agonizingly slower.

495
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.700
Can I get an amen?

496
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.500
But see that plurality is a divinely given

497
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.700
slowing mechanism that helps

498
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.000
us drive toward biblical decisions. No

499
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.600
matter the cost.

500
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.000
So what are the benefits of plurality plurality protects the

501
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.800
church against false teaching?

502
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.200
And from one person driving the church into the ground there is

503
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.800
no one man Island.

504
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.600
Plurality holds Elders accountable so

505
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.700
important and it refines ideas and decisions

506
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.200
through different giftings different perspectives.

507
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.400
We're not all the same.

508
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.000
And it looks a lot like we see in Acts 15.

509
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.200
Plurality makes it possible to care for more people.

510
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.100
And it helps share the load to guard against burnout.

511
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.400
many of us grew up in a

512
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.500
church with one Pastor over everything and maybe

513
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.500
even a beacon board underneath

514
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.500
and we're not saying that single Pastor

515
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.400
LED churches are heretical.

516
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.200
But it is a significant departure from

517
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.100
the model that is clearly laid out in Scripture.

518
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.000
How does that happen?

519
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.400
That happens through man-made tradition.

520
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.200
Because this idea of One Pastor leading a church

521
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.200
is not found in the Bible.

522
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.900
It's clear. The church is Led fed cared for and protected

523
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.000
by Elders plural?

524
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.200
Back to the text still in verse 5 Titus is

525
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.600
to appoint Elders in every town or every Church.

526
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.100
And this these Church plants and create were young.

527
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.100
Have you ever thought that every church was a

528
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.200
plant at some point?

529
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.400
Even Henderson Hills was 1964 was when

530
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.600
we were launched out of our friends at First Baptist.

531
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.500
And we were launched under the name Henderson Hills

532
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.000
Baptist Mission.

533
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.800
It was August 1996 32 years after

534
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.700
we were planted.

535
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.500
That the light was shined on God's word for

536
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.400
us toward elders.

537
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.800
And toward breaking with tradition.

538
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.200
Okay, that's verse 5. Let's keep moving by asking our next

539
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.100
question. What are the qualifications for Elder? What are

540
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.300
the qualifications for Elder?

541
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.100
Verse 6 Paul begins laying out a set

542
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.100
of important qualifications that describe the necessary character

543
00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.600
of an elder we can understand why

544
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.700
qualifications and are important when we read in

545
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.000
Acts 20:28.

546
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.200
Now Paul In this passage is talking to he's addressing

547
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.700
a group of Ephesian elders.

548
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.000
when he says

549
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.500
pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock.

550
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:21.900
or church

551
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.000
In which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers again,

552
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.800
that's elders.

553
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.200
To care for the Church of God, which he obtained with

554
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.000
his own blood.

555
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.600
Church our adversary the devil is prowling

556
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.600
around like a roaring lion and

557
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.200
he is seeking someone to devour.

558
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.700
And he would love to take out elders.

559
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.300
Because you don't have to read too far into the news to

560
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.200
see how often.

561
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.600
pastors Elders leaders fall

562
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.000
Through Scandal through abuse.

563
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.200
through Pride

564
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.200
If we were if we are to take God's word, seriously, we

565
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.400
must recognize the need to

566
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.500
install Godly elders.

567
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.600
And to remove those who are not.

568
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.700
Souls are at stake.

569
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.400
Christ demands Godly Elders Christ

570
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.400
demand Godly elders

571
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.500
and this list we're about to read is what

572
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.900
qualifies an elder as Godly.

573
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.900
Let's start making our way through starting in verse 6 together.

574
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.300
It says if anyone is above reproach this idea of

575
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.000
being above reproach can be seen as a summary over all the qualifications.

576
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.400
This means that he should be free from any kind

577
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.700
of damaging accusations.

578
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.600
He must have a good reputation with people outside.

579
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.500
The church Elders should

580
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.100
not give the church a bad name.

581
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.800
Or Christ a bad name.

582
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.500
Next we read the husband of one wife the statement literally

583
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.600
means one woman, man.

584
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.000
And this doesn't mean that an elder has to be

585
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.400
married.

586
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.000
Paul was single after all.

587
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.600
But rather if he is married.

588
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.200
He must be faithful to.

589
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.200
Absolutely committed to his wife.

590
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.100
including with his eyes

591
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:37.000
never before have there been so many temptations that

592
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.900
can destroy marriage.

593
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:42.900
husbands

594
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.300
love your wives.

595
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.400
As Christ loved the church and gave himself up

596
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:49.900
for her.

597
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.300
Ephesians 5:25 says

598
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.700
now does this qualification of husband and one wife mean that

599
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.400
the office of Elder is reserved for

600
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.100
men does it mean that it's reserved for men?

601
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.000
As always the Bible is our guide here.

602
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.000
We believe the answer is yes scripture says the office of Elder is by

603
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.700
men who are called by the Holy Spirit.

604
00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.700
And this is supported by Jesus selection of 12 men

605
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.600
to be his disciples and then

606
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.500
later by the apostles establishing a policy.

607
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.700
That the office of Elder be only for men and

608
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.100
this passage is an example of that men

609
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.000
are seen as the primary teachers and

610
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.600
leaders of the congregation.

611
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400
Now this doesn't mean

612
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.000
that women are somehow lesser.

613
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.300
Than men or that they don't do

614
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.100
vital Ministry in the church.

615
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.700
but rather what this is saying is that

616
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.800
some rules are not interchangeable.

617
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.800
It also doesn't mean women can't be wonderful teachers and leaders

618
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.800
and we'll read that from Titus in

619
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.500
the coming weeks.

620
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.800
Instead we celebrate all the ways that women

621
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.500
can use their gifts and serve the

622
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.700
church in complementary partnership with

623
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.200
men.

624
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.100
This year as we dive deeper into the topic of

625
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.300
women in mystery. We will see the same

626
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.500
in the same way all the ways that God has blessed you

627
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.700
to serve his kingdom. So be

628
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.900
looking forward to that.

629
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.300
Continuing still in verse 6 and his children are

630
00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.300
believers and not open to the charge of debauchery

631
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.600
or insubordination.

632
00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.100
Now his children are believers.

633
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.000
That's a tricky one.

634
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.500
Because who saves?

635
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.200
Not the parents.

636
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.400
God does he chooses?

637
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.400
So the Greek word underneath Believers is pestos which

638
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.600
means faithful as in his

639
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.400
children our faithful to him. There's a loyalty there. There's

640
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.100
a holding fast to this man.

641
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.400
In this idea of debauch. You just means that his

642
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.700
kids aren't sunken into themselves.

643
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.700
Just wallowing in self-indulgence.

644
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.700
And that they not be insubordinate just means that they submit to

645
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.700
his authority.

646
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:29.800
so

647
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.800
the Elder leads a well-managed household and

648
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.900
if you ask kids there will behaved.

649
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.700
He loves his kids and questionably. He leads

650
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.900
them spiritual he pours into them how he

651
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.000
is with his kids is visibly admirable.

652
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.100
Now why is this assessment of the home vital?

653
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.400
Because the home is the training ground for

654
00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.400
an elder.

655
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.800
The home is the training ground for The Elder and Paul

656
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.400
says so in first Timothy 3:5 where he

657
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.800
says this about Elders for if someone does not know how to

658
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.300
manage his own household. How will he

659
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.200
care for God's Church?

660
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.900
Notice that the qualification is the home.

661
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.100
Not if you've knocked it out of the park in your career.

662
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.700
And what a reversal this is from the way the world Works, isn't

663
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.700
it?

664
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.400
in verse 7 Paul continues

665
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.100
for an overseer as God's Steward must be

666
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.100
above reproach.

667
00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.100
Paul writes at the overseer again Elder is God's Steward

668
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.000
of the church.

669
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.700
The church does not belong to the elders.

670
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.300
It is God's and the elders are given the

671
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.900
privilege and the responsibility to lead it to Steward

672
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.100
it.

673
00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.700
Continuing the Elder shouldn't be arrogant or a quick tempered instead

674
00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.400
Elders are to be humble men.

675
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.500
Quick to listen slow to speak slow to anger.

676
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.200
Nor should the Elder be a drunkard. This

677
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.600
doesn't mean a Prohibition of alcohol. It just

678
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.100
speaks to the abuse of it.

679
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.500
Nor should the Elder be violent to be violent is the opposite of

680
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.300
Jesus that we see in Matthew 11 where he

681
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.700
is gentle and lowly in heart.

682
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.200
This doesn't mean weak.

683
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.200
These men are to be humble and gentle

684
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.000
and strong.

685
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.800
humble gentle and strong

686
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.200
continuing the Elder shouldn't be greedy for

687
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.500
gain.

688
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.400
He's not in this for gain. His lifestyle is

689
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.200
not extravagant and he is a generous man.

690
00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.400
And he should be hospitable. He loves

691
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.600
people his home is open so much

692
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.600
that the hinges are worn thin on

693
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.300
his doors.

694
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.200
And he's a lover of good. He's self-controlled which

695
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.500
means that he can keep his desires and check. He knows

696
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.500
his limits.

697
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.400
He knows that he needs to be accountable to

698
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.000
other people.

699
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.500
And he is upright which just means just this means

700
00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.500
that he cares about Justice being done to people.

701
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.900
And most importantly he is Holy. He is

702
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.100
Holy.

703
00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.300
Or devout he is devoted to

704
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.300
Christ. He is a life. He's

705
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.000
living a life that is devoted to prayer and to meditation

706
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.800
on God's word.

707
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.600
And he's disciplined. The last requirement is so important. He

708
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.400
must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught

709
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.000
so that he may be able to give instruction in sound

710
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.800
Doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict

711
00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.000
it.

712
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.200
This is a man. Who is White Knuckle holding

713
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.400
on to God's word like a life

714
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:06.900
raft?

715
00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.500
And he is skilled in preaching and

716
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.300
teaching and exhortation.

717
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.600
And he knows biblical Doctrine.

718
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.600
And he has eagle eyes toward error and he

719
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.400
is going to confront that head on.

720
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.800
Those are the qualifications for Elder.

721
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.300
These are Godly men. They lead their family.

722
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:29.700
Well.

723
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.400
And they can teach the Bible.

724
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.400
That was the last of the seven questions. Now, we move on

725
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.500
to the bonus round. We have two bonus

726
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.500
questions that don't immediately pop out of the passage.

727
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.500
The first is this how many Elders should be in place in a

728
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.000
church. How many Elders should be in place in a church?

729
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.400
The answer varies of course depending on the church, but here

730
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.600
at Henderson Hills. We have eight active elders.

731
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.800
We don't set limits.

732
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.700
Other than there has to be a plurality

733
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.000
and never a single Elder.

734
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.200
The number is in some ways a function of the size of

735
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:12.600
the church.

736
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.300
But ultimately, it's God's call on a man that makes

737
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.200
him an elder the holy spirit makes him

738
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.000
an elder

739
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.600
So any kind of man-made quota or limit?

740
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.800
Is a recipe for missing God's decision his

741
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.200
will for the church and for the

742
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:32.300
man.

743
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.800
That leads us perfectly to our next question. How do you become an elder?

744
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.000
How do you become an elder?

745
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.600
First Timothy 3:1 says the sane is trustworthy if

746
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.700
anyone aspires to the office of overseer. He

747
00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.200
desires a noble task.

748
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.500
You aspire to it and you desire it.

749
00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.200
It may also involve someone encouraging you toward this

750
00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.600
to maybe awaken or to affirm this

751
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.700
desire that you have.

752
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:08.100
For me it was over lunch at Cafe

753
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.700
icon. Just down the road here.

754
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.800
With an elder and I'll always remember this if

755
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.200
seven years ago, he slid a book on

756
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.500
eldership across the table right past the

757
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.000
soy sauce.

758
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:21.900
and he asked

759
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.800
if I might consider this

760
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.200
the Bible also teaches that you shouldn't Elder under compulsion, but

761
00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.800
willingly first Peter says

762
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.200
But most importantly Above All Else, we've already heard

763
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.800
this is that you are called by the Holy Spirit to this

764
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.200
acts 28 2028 is clear

765
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.700
on this that the Holy Spirit has made you and

766
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.700
overseer.

767
00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.400
What is the elder candidate candidate process look like

768
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.400
at Henderson Hills? Well first

769
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.600
we look at all 21 scriptural qualifications. We

770
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.400
see that in Titus one

771
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.200
for Timothy 3 first Peter 5.

772
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.900
And as we looked at we looked at that list of qualifications today,

773
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.300
did you notice that all of those

774
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.700
qualifications are observable?

775
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.300
And that means that they can be evaluated and

776
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.200
tested.

777
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.900
And so we evaluate and we test.

778
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.000
We we have a process. It's up to two years long sometimes

779
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.400
longer.

780
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:33.300
And in that we do training, we do classes examination

781
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.900
interviews mentorship as

782
00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.000
we seek to verify and affirm your calling.

783
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.600
After that, there's unanimous vote by Elders to put you forward in

784
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.500
front of the congregation who ultimately decides and

785
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.300
votes if you are to be an elder of

786
00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:49.700
the church.

787
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.900
You must attest even called by God to this

788
00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:56.700
office.

789
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.700
and much of your qualification

790
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.000
is up to this idea of how are you

791
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.400
eldering before you Elder?

792
00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.500
How are you leading feeding caring for and protecting the

793
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:10.900
body?

794
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.400
Now the reality is this it's not a popularity

795
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:16.900
contest.

796
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.700
Eldership is certainly an Avenue toward being less popular.

797
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.100
That's for sure.

798
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.700
Nor is it something to pad your resume? It's nothing less

799
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.700
than shepherding.

800
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.200
God's Church

801
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.200
We'll let that be the last question for today, but I really do.

802
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.700
I hope this this opens up 7,000 other questions for

803
00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.200
you grab us. Well, we'd love to answer any questions

804
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:42.500
you have.

805
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.100
Now do you see how this might be an uncomfortable thing

806
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.700
for me in some ways to go over this list

807
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.500
of qualifications? Because first of all, it

808
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.500
shouldn't be seen at all. The elders are somehow super Christians.

809
00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.700
or in a different League of Christianity altogether

810
00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.500
Nor should it be seen that this list is just for elders.

811
00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.900
It's for all of us. It's what the Christian Life should aim toward.

812
00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.900
But here's the plot twist.

813
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:19.000
This list is impossible to meet

814
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.600
perfectly.

815
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.500
Now does that mean that this list needs to be toned down

816
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.000
or watered down in some way to

817
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:27.900
make it more achievable?

818
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.400
No, God is perfectly righteous. And

819
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.500
this is his standard.

820
00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.200
But let this impossibility point us even

821
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.100
more to his grace.

822
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.200
Remember, this is more about him than us.

823
00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.300
In second Corinthians 12:9 Paul quotes

824
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:51.200
Jesus. My grace is sufficient for you

825
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.900
for my power is made perfect in weakness.

826
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.400
Therefore I Paul will boast all

827
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.200
the more gladly of my weakness so that the power

828
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.200
of Christ May rest upon me.

829
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.200
Did you catch that?

830
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.300
Our weakness it sets the stage for the

831
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.200
power of Christ to rest upon us and

832
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.900
for his glory to be on full display

833
00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.300
for a world that needs him.

834
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.300
Unbeliever the power of Christ the power

835
00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.900
of his work on the cross for us is able to

836
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.400
bring you into his fold.

837
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.400
into his shepherding care

838
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.400
no matter what you've done. His grace is sufficient for you.

839
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.700
No matter what your life looks like no matter how your life

840
00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.400
looks like the complete opposite of that list.

841
00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.700
God is asking you today to trust in Jesus

842
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.600
his death means forgiveness for

843
00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.000
every one of your sins every single

844
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.800
one of them if you turn away

845
00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.300
from your sins and you trust in Jesus as

846
00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.300
Lord of your life.

847
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.500
and the reward

848
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.500
Heaven it's eternity in heaven with him.

849
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:20.500
If this is speaking to you come for talk to one of us down front after

850
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.000
the service. We'd love to talk with you about that.

851
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.500
Church his power is perfectly on

852
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.900
display in our imperfection.

853
00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.900
And we know this to be true.

854
00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.000
That one day he will make perfect. Perfect.

855
00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.800
We look forward to that now. What is our answer?

856
00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.100
What is our answer to

857
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.800
this call for? Holy living and

858
00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.500
for Godly leadership. Yes, we

859
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.000
do. We answer back with a changed life.

860
00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.700
That's in submission to write Authority

861
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.700
Hebrews 13:17. And in

862
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.600
response to this awesome reality that we are

863
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.100
his very own.

864
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.500
And ultimately Christ is our answer.

865
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.500
His grace is sufficient.

866
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.700
Christ cares so much for his church that he

867
00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.000
demands Godly Elders be put in place

868
00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.800
for his glory and for your good.
