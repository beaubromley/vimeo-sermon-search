1
00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:19.925
Well, good morning again, church.

2
00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:22.125
It's always a blessing to get together like this

3
00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.605
and worship together, especially with an extra hour

4
00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.165
of sleep last night.

5
00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:28.165
Well, I shouldn't say that for everyone.

6
00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:29.645
These new parents didn't get that.

7
00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:31.485
They just, the kid just wakes up an hour earlier.

8
00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:35.325
Uh, and then many of you had the alarm on your phone go off

9
00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.645
last night at 2:00 AM So we're all

10
00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:39.085
refreshed and ready to go today.

11
00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:40.125
It's a good day. Uh,

12
00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:41.645
but if you're new to our church,

13
00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:43.125
we're grateful you are here.

14
00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:44.685
We'd love to get to meet you.

15
00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:46.565
There's a QR code on the seat in front of you,

16
00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:49.005
or you can just head out to the new here area out there.

17
00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:50.885
And, uh, just let us know you're here.

18
00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:52.045
We'd love to meet you and get

19
00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:53.125
you some information about our church.

20
00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:54.765
Get to know you a little bit. Uh,

21
00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:56.045
or maybe you've been here a little bit.

22
00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:58.405
Uh, you're, you're seeing like this is

23
00:00:58.405 --> 00:01:00.285
where you wanna plant roots and become a part

24
00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:02.365
of our church family through membership.

25
00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.845
Next Sunday evening, we're having

26
00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:07.045
what we call meaningful membership workshop.

27
00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:08.845
It's a way for you to get to know us

28
00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:13.085
and kind of discern what really we are about as a church.

29
00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:15.325
And that would be the first step

30
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:16.845
towards becoming a member of our church.

31
00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:19.085
So if that's for you, please sign up on the app

32
00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.325
or on the website or just out there in the lobby.

33
00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:23.165
Find somebody that can help you do that.

34
00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:26.285
But I wanna start today with a question.

35
00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:30.375
Do you feel worthless to God?

36
00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:36.585
Like, do you feel like you bring nothing to the table?

37
00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:39.945
Especially like compared to other people

38
00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:41.345
and other people in minute?

39
00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.905
Like, do you, do you feel worthless to God?

40
00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:47.495
Or maybe that's not you.

41
00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:48.735
Maybe you're on the other side of this.

42
00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:49.935
Maybe you know you have a purpose

43
00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:52.215
and you know that God can use you, but,

44
00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:55.895
but your issue is that you feel like the things

45
00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.775
that we face in life are just too great, too overwhelming.

46
00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:02.345
There's no way we can overcome.

47
00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:08.465
Well, either way. This passage in one Samuel will speak

48
00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:12.465
to you today, but not only to you.

49
00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.825
It'll also speak to all of us

50
00:02:15.225 --> 00:02:19.185
because it's gonna point us to a battle that only God

51
00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.185
can actually win for us.

52
00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:26.545
And that's the point of this narrative today.

53
00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:28.825
So if you're not already there, go ahead

54
00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:31.425
and turn in your copy of God's word to one Samuel

55
00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:35.505
Chapter 13, one Samuel 13.

56
00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:38.425
We continue our He Shall Reign series

57
00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:41.025
through this book of one Samuel.

58
00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:44.655
We're well into it by now.

59
00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:47.375
But last week you remember, we tragically witnessed

60
00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:53.025
Saul's initial disobedience, Which led

61
00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:56.785
to God removing the kingship from his family line, that even

62
00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:59.525
after he is dead, it won't continue In Saul's line,

63
00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:00.765
there's gonna be a new family line

64
00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:02.525
that the king will come from.

65
00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:05.965
And so we saw that begin,

66
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.645
but we also were reminded by that of how futile

67
00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:13.925
their search for a saving king actually was.

68
00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:18.005
Why was it futile? Because they already had a saving king

69
00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:19.325
whose name was Yahweh.

70
00:03:20.245 --> 00:03:22.895
They didn't need another king, but they sure wanted one.

71
00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:25.135
But it was really fruitless.

72
00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:29.315
Well, today's the continuation of that scene.

73
00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:31.115
'cause we're moving now into the battle

74
00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:32.715
with the Philistines.

75
00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:36.055
Remember, they were pressing hard on the people of Israel.

76
00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:37.535
They were terrifying the people of Israel.

77
00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:39.975
And so notice what happened here.

78
00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:44.365
Notice what happened as we go into the narrative again,

79
00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:47.005
remember, many people had run away from Saul.

80
00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:48.325
They were hiding in the mountains.

81
00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:49.965
They were running over the, the river.

82
00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:51.565
They were, they were seeing

83
00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:53.045
that this was a terrifying situation.

84
00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:54.245
And so we continued.

85
00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:57.965
Now starting with the back half of verse 15,

86
00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:02.575
one Samuel 13, verse 15, about halfway

87
00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:05.275
through says this.

88
00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:07.955
And Saul numbered the people who were present with him,

89
00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:10.595
about 600 men.

90
00:04:10.615 --> 00:04:12.795
Now remember they started with 3000,

91
00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:15.365
just a few verses earlier.

92
00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:18.485
Now they're down to 600. Not just men.

93
00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:21.445
Terrified men who were even with Saul still

94
00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:26.095
so clearly the Israelite army got smaller.

95
00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:30.825
It was small to begin with, but it got much smaller.

96
00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:34.625
Like you'd think this massive Philistine armies pressing

97
00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:36.105
and they recruit more troops.

98
00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:39.145
Actually, what happened is they were losing troops.

99
00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:41.815
Instead, ominous.

100
00:04:43.765 --> 00:04:45.305
Not only was their army getting smaller,

101
00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:47.065
the Philistine army was getting closer.

102
00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:52.005
They were getting closer. This threat was increasing

103
00:04:52.715 --> 00:04:54.965
that they were getting smaller on their side.

104
00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:57.565
But the threat was increasing. Watch this happen.

105
00:04:57.595 --> 00:04:59.325
This is verses 16 through 18.

106
00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:01.965
This army gets closer to Saul

107
00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:05.145
and his men, verse 16.

108
00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:06.585
And Saul and Jonathan, his son

109
00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:08.425
and the people who were present with him stayed

110
00:05:08.445 --> 00:05:09.785
in Giba of Benjamin.

111
00:05:09.785 --> 00:05:11.065
But the Philistines had camped in

112
00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:13.905
Mash just a little bit further east from there.

113
00:05:13.965 --> 00:05:15.465
And Raiders came outta the camp

114
00:05:15.465 --> 00:05:17.265
of the Philistines in three companies.

115
00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:21.185
One company turned toward Oprah to the land of swa,

116
00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:23.825
another company toward Beth Horan,

117
00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:25.385
another company toward the border

118
00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:27.545
that looks down on the valley of Zebu

119
00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:29.745
towards the wilderness.

120
00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:33.945
Now, I know some of you have your ancient Israelite

121
00:05:34.225 --> 00:05:35.545
geography just right on the forefront

122
00:05:35.545 --> 00:05:36.545
of your mind all the time.

123
00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:38.185
Uh, but for the rest of us,

124
00:05:38.185 --> 00:05:39.545
lemme explain what you just read.

125
00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:43.345
It really, it's hard to put it on a map.

126
00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:44.865
'cause we don't actually know exactly

127
00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:45.945
where all these places were.

128
00:05:46.335 --> 00:05:47.585
Just think of it this way.

129
00:05:47.835 --> 00:05:50.345
These three companies of the Philistines were trying

130
00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:51.985
to surround Saul.

131
00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:54.665
That's basically what it's saying.

132
00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:57.380
One went here, one went here, one went here just trying

133
00:05:57.425 --> 00:06:00.965
to surround Saul and his army.

134
00:06:03.465 --> 00:06:07.325
Not only that, look at verses 19 through 23 as well.

135
00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:11.055
Now, there were, there was no blacksmith

136
00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:12.775
to be found throughout all the land of Israel.

137
00:06:13.275 --> 00:06:14.335
For the Philistines said,

138
00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:17.895
let the lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears.

139
00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:21.055
But every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines

140
00:06:21.055 --> 00:06:25.375
to sharpen his plowshare, his madoc, his ax or his sickle.

141
00:06:25.475 --> 00:06:27.775
And the charge was two thirds of a shekel

142
00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:30.695
for the Plowshares, for the Maddox, a third of a shekel

143
00:06:30.695 --> 00:06:32.935
for sharpening the axes, for setting the gods.

144
00:06:33.395 --> 00:06:36.455
So on the day of the battle, so we'll get there in a second.

145
00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:38.935
On the day of the battle, there was neither sword

146
00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:42.095
nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul

147
00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:44.455
and Jonathan, except for Saul and Jonathan.

148
00:06:44.595 --> 00:06:46.375
His son had swords.

149
00:06:46.995 --> 00:06:48.655
And the garrison, the Philistines, went out

150
00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:50.855
to the past of Mik Mash.

151
00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:53.695
Some of you have never heard any

152
00:06:53.695 --> 00:06:55.095
of those words before in your life.

153
00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:58.455
Honestly, I just read it and saw Maddock.

154
00:06:58.655 --> 00:07:00.575
I don't even know what that is. Okay, so again,

155
00:07:01.335 --> 00:07:03.215
fascinating words involved in this passage.

156
00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:05.795
Lemme explain what's happening.

157
00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:09.635
There were no metal workers in the land of Israel

158
00:07:10.265 --> 00:07:13.755
because the Philistines controlled metal

159
00:07:13.765 --> 00:07:15.515
production and maintenance.

160
00:07:17.295 --> 00:07:20.195
So what they had done is they had effectively disarmed

161
00:07:20.455 --> 00:07:23.515
Israel completely and put up a picture

162
00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:25.675
of ancient farm tools.

163
00:07:26.455 --> 00:07:29.075
We don't know if this is exactly what they had, but,

164
00:07:29.135 --> 00:07:32.515
but even the farm tools that Israel would've had

165
00:07:32.895 --> 00:07:34.795
to use in their gardens

166
00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:37.355
or in their fields, they had to go

167
00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:39.835
to the Philistines to sharpen them.

168
00:07:40.135 --> 00:07:41.795
And all the prices that you read there,

169
00:07:41.855 --> 00:07:43.155
of course we have no framework for that,

170
00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:45.515
but they were outrageously high prices

171
00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:47.685
like to go get a knife.

172
00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:51.445
Sharpened was like $150, you might say something like that.

173
00:07:52.485 --> 00:07:53.655
It's just extreme.

174
00:07:53.995 --> 00:07:55.495
And what the Philistine, it says it right?

175
00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:57.775
The Philistines were doing was saying, we don't want them

176
00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:01.295
to have swords or anything they could use in battle.

177
00:08:03.695 --> 00:08:06.035
The point is that when the battle would come,

178
00:08:06.615 --> 00:08:10.235
the the Israelites were severely under supplied

179
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.035
because the Philistines not only had swords,

180
00:08:14.105 --> 00:08:15.435
they also had chariots.

181
00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:20.205
And they're over here with like a pocket knife in Israel.

182
00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:25.465
Then you couple that with the fact

183
00:08:25.465 --> 00:08:27.905
that the Philistine army had surrounded them.

184
00:08:29.955 --> 00:08:32.695
And what this is leading us to think about is that Saul,

185
00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:37.865
his, his defeat seemed inevitable.

186
00:08:40.605 --> 00:08:43.605
Remember God had said, Saul, you're going to be judged

187
00:08:43.745 --> 00:08:45.925
for your disobedience.

188
00:08:46.795 --> 00:08:47.885
This is when it's gonna happen.

189
00:08:47.885 --> 00:08:49.005
It sure seems like it, right?

190
00:08:49.075 --> 00:08:51.405
That that God's judgment was coming through the Philistines,

191
00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:54.445
that Saul was gonna finally get what he was deserving of.

192
00:08:57.035 --> 00:09:01.495
But if you recall a new character we met last week in the

193
00:09:01.495 --> 00:09:03.585
narrative, an honorable,

194
00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:05.665
courageous young man named Jonathan.

195
00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:08.505
Jonathan was Saul's son.

196
00:09:08.525 --> 00:09:09.625
And because of Jonathan,

197
00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:12.145
things may actually turn out differently.

198
00:09:12.355 --> 00:09:13.425
Let's see,

199
00:09:13.425 --> 00:09:15.465
because remember, Jonathan was set

200
00:09:15.465 --> 00:09:16.825
in contrast to his father.

201
00:09:18.095 --> 00:09:19.865
Saul and Jonathan were set in contrast

202
00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:21.345
and we'll see it very clearly here.

203
00:09:21.555 --> 00:09:23.105
We're gonna jump into chapter 14.

204
00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.105
Now I'm gonna read 15 verses

205
00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:26.905
so we can follow this narrative.

206
00:09:28.605 --> 00:09:29.665
You've set the scene, right?

207
00:09:29.665 --> 00:09:30.985
You know what this is gonna feel like.

208
00:09:31.045 --> 00:09:32.465
You know where we're at in this whole thing.

209
00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:35.065
Now watch chapter 14.

210
00:09:35.205 --> 00:09:38.105
One day, Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man

211
00:09:38.105 --> 00:09:40.705
who carried his armor, come let us go over

212
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.345
to the Philistine Garrison on the other side.

213
00:09:43.005 --> 00:09:44.185
He did not tell his father.

214
00:09:45.465 --> 00:09:47.155
Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibbon

215
00:09:47.155 --> 00:09:48.595
and the pomegranate cave at mid grand.

216
00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:51.835
The people who were with him were about 600 men, including

217
00:09:52.415 --> 00:09:56.195
Aja, the son of a high tube Kobas brother, son of Phineas,

218
00:09:56.215 --> 00:09:58.635
son of Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh,

219
00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:01.075
wearing an EFA that'll come into play next week.

220
00:10:01.095 --> 00:10:04.385
You'll see that. And the people did not know

221
00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:05.905
that Jonathan had gone within the passes

222
00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:07.545
by which Jonathan sought to go over

223
00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:08.785
to the Philistine garrison.

224
00:10:08.785 --> 00:10:10.305
There was a rocky crack on one side,

225
00:10:10.665 --> 00:10:11.985
a rocky crowd on the other side.

226
00:10:12.255 --> 00:10:14.705
Name of the one was bozo, the name of the other Cena.

227
00:10:15.165 --> 00:10:17.905
The one Craig rose in the north in front of Mash,

228
00:10:17.925 --> 00:10:20.105
the other on the south in front of Giba.

229
00:10:20.105 --> 00:10:21.105
And so set the scene.

230
00:10:21.105 --> 00:10:24.745
It's like a valley, almost a, a kind of a slim way to crab,

231
00:10:24.845 --> 00:10:25.865
to gr go through there.

232
00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:28.465
You'd have to climb hills to get out of it.

233
00:10:28.465 --> 00:10:31.385
That's where we're at. Jonathan said to the young man

234
00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:33.585
who carried his armor, come, let us go over to the garrison

235
00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:35.425
of these uncircumcised.

236
00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:37.585
It may be that the Lord will work for us

237
00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:40.345
for nothing can hinder the Lord from saving

238
00:10:40.565 --> 00:10:42.025
by many or by few.

239
00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:45.655
And his armor said to him, do all that's in your heart.

240
00:10:45.715 --> 00:10:49.135
Do as you wish. Behold, I'm with you, heart and soul.

241
00:10:50.255 --> 00:10:52.745
Then Jonathan said, behold, we'll cross over to the men.

242
00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:54.225
We will show ourselves to them.

243
00:10:54.605 --> 00:10:57.185
If they say to us, wait until we come to you,

244
00:10:57.185 --> 00:10:58.785
then we'll stand still in our place.

245
00:10:59.045 --> 00:11:00.105
We will not go up to them.

246
00:11:00.845 --> 00:11:03.665
But if they say, come up to us, then we'll go up.

247
00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:05.905
For the Lord has given them into our hand.

248
00:11:06.095 --> 00:11:08.745
This shall be the sign for us.

249
00:11:10.165 --> 00:11:12.465
So both of them showed themselves to the garrison

250
00:11:12.465 --> 00:11:15.065
of the Philistines and the Philistines said, look,

251
00:11:15.215 --> 00:11:17.105
Hebrews are coming out of the holes

252
00:11:17.595 --> 00:11:19.185
where they have hidden themselves.

253
00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:21.705
And the minute of the garrison hailed,

254
00:11:21.905 --> 00:11:23.785
Jonathan Armor bears said, come up to us,

255
00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:25.465
will show you a thing.

256
00:11:25.805 --> 00:11:28.625
And Jonathan said to his armor, bearer, come up after me.

257
00:11:28.765 --> 00:11:31.505
The Lord has given them into the hand of Israel.

258
00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:34.265
Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands

259
00:11:34.265 --> 00:11:36.985
and feet, his armor bearer after him and they fell.

260
00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:38.025
The Philistines fell

261
00:11:38.025 --> 00:11:40.905
before Jonathan, his armor bearer killed them after him.

262
00:11:41.095 --> 00:11:44.385
That first strike, which Jonathan's armor bearer made,

263
00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:48.505
killed about 20 men within, as it were a furrows length

264
00:11:48.505 --> 00:11:51.505
and an acre of a land, basically a football field size.

265
00:11:52.765 --> 00:11:55.405
And there was a panic in the camp in the field

266
00:11:55.735 --> 00:11:58.125
among all the people, the garrison

267
00:11:58.125 --> 00:12:00.925
and even the Raiders trembled the earth quaked.

268
00:12:01.065 --> 00:12:03.725
And it became a very great panic.

269
00:12:05.795 --> 00:12:09.015
So did you see what just happened here

270
00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:15.425
in the face of a dire threat, possessing

271
00:12:15.945 --> 00:12:20.145
inferior weaponry, Jonathan trusted the Lord.

272
00:12:22.925 --> 00:12:27.445
You see it? He's way outmatched.

273
00:12:27.515 --> 00:12:31.125
They are way outmatched. Jonathan instead, trusted the Lord.

274
00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:34.125
Did you see it? Three times in this scene,

275
00:12:34.785 --> 00:12:36.805
he expressed faith in Yahweh.

276
00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:38.765
Look at it. Verse six.

277
00:12:40.005 --> 00:12:43.225
He says, it may be that the Lord will work for us,

278
00:12:43.725 --> 00:12:47.065
for nothing can hinder the Lord from saving

279
00:12:47.485 --> 00:12:48.985
by many or by few.

280
00:12:51.375 --> 00:12:56.125
Verse 10, he says, the Lord has given them into our hands.

281
00:12:57.435 --> 00:13:00.695
And then verse 12, the Lord has given them into the

282
00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:02.055
hand of Israel.

283
00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:07.025
You see, Jonathan, his trust again, counter to his father.

284
00:13:07.785 --> 00:13:10.745
Jonathan trusted the Lord to bring the victory.

285
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.295
That was his faith.

286
00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:17.135
He didn't look around and see the massive army as a threat.

287
00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:21.935
Jonathan knew that his God was all powerful.

288
00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:25.495
He'd come through before he'd delivered them before.

289
00:13:25.795 --> 00:13:26.975
So he surely would, again,

290
00:13:28.495 --> 00:13:30.265
he's witnessed God's faithfulness.

291
00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:32.505
He'll see it again. He knew it.

292
00:13:35.365 --> 00:13:37.905
And so Jonathan goes and instigates the battle.

293
00:13:39.355 --> 00:13:42.325
Well, the Philistines of course panicked,

294
00:13:44.705 --> 00:13:46.615
which would get the attention of Saul

295
00:13:46.635 --> 00:13:49.575
and his men back on their side of the ravine,

296
00:13:50.595 --> 00:13:52.225
which is actually what we see next.

297
00:13:52.425 --> 00:13:53.865
'cause. Watch this. Verse 16

298
00:13:56.885 --> 00:13:59.145
and the watchmen of Saul in Gibbon

299
00:13:59.145 --> 00:14:00.305
and in of Benjamin, looked

300
00:14:00.325 --> 00:14:01.625
and behold the multitude

301
00:14:01.685 --> 00:14:04.745
of Philistines was dispersing here and there.

302
00:14:06.115 --> 00:14:08.735
And then Saul said to the people who were with him, count

303
00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:10.535
and see who has gone from us.

304
00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:12.615
And when they had counted, behold Jonathan

305
00:14:12.615 --> 00:14:15.135
and his armor bearer were not there.

306
00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:18.975
So naturally Saul looks at this

307
00:14:18.975 --> 00:14:22.935
and says, somebody's up to something who left?

308
00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:27.975
Who did it? And watch what Saul does.

309
00:14:28.005 --> 00:14:30.015
Then in response to that,

310
00:14:31.165 --> 00:14:33.025
and as I read this, remember

311
00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:36.105
what we witnessed Saul do last week when he had the

312
00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:38.305
offerings and the whole thing, he offered the offering

313
00:14:38.325 --> 00:14:39.385
not with the right heart.

314
00:14:39.805 --> 00:14:41.465
He didn't really want to follow God.

315
00:14:41.485 --> 00:14:44.585
He just felt like he had to watch what Saul does.

316
00:14:44.935 --> 00:14:46.065
Next verse 18.

317
00:14:48.145 --> 00:14:50.845
So Saul said to Aja, I remember that was the priest

318
00:14:51.615 --> 00:14:55.605
bring the arc of God here for the arc of God went at

319
00:14:55.605 --> 00:14:57.205
that time with the people of Israel.

320
00:14:57.825 --> 00:14:59.965
Now, while Saul was talking to the priest,

321
00:15:00.465 --> 00:15:01.765
the tumult in the camp

322
00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:04.325
of the Philistines increased more and more.

323
00:15:05.345 --> 00:15:08.925
So Saul said to the priest, withdraw your hand.

324
00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:11.205
Here's what was happening here.

325
00:15:12.175 --> 00:15:15.515
It, it seems like Saul was trying

326
00:15:15.535 --> 00:15:19.755
to get a vision from the Lord by doing this with the arc

327
00:15:19.935 --> 00:15:22.355
and with the priest because the priest had a way of,

328
00:15:22.535 --> 00:15:24.475
of putting his hand near the arc and,

329
00:15:24.575 --> 00:15:27.155
and trying to get a vision from God and,

330
00:15:27.175 --> 00:15:30.155
and seeing an oracle kind of a thought and vision

331
00:15:30.215 --> 00:15:32.915
and feeling to say, here's what God wants us to do.

332
00:15:32.985 --> 00:15:34.235
That was what was happening here.

333
00:15:34.455 --> 00:15:38.235
But what Saul was doing with that was essentially, again,

334
00:15:38.445 --> 00:15:43.235
using it as a superstitious way to discern what God wants

335
00:15:43.495 --> 00:15:46.835
to hear God and and get God on his side in a way.

336
00:15:49.185 --> 00:15:50.845
And we know it was superstitious

337
00:15:50.845 --> 00:15:54.725
that he's using this right thing to seek God.

338
00:15:55.025 --> 00:15:56.725
But we know it was superstitious

339
00:15:56.885 --> 00:15:57.965
'cause he didn't even finish it.

340
00:16:00.015 --> 00:16:01.955
He sees the battles getting stronger.

341
00:16:02.015 --> 00:16:04.755
And so he says, stop that and we're doing something else.

342
00:16:04.845 --> 00:16:08.875
Watch what he does next. Verse 20, they move on their own.

343
00:16:09.225 --> 00:16:11.715
Saul and all the people who were with him rallied

344
00:16:11.715 --> 00:16:12.795
and went into the battle

345
00:16:14.455 --> 00:16:17.275
and behold every Philistine sword was against his fellow.

346
00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:20.235
And there was very great confusion.

347
00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:22.995
Now when you read that,

348
00:16:23.975 --> 00:16:25.675
it sure seems like things are going well.

349
00:16:27.635 --> 00:16:29.775
The Philistines are so confused by all this

350
00:16:29.775 --> 00:16:32.215
that they're killing each other in some way as well.

351
00:16:32.475 --> 00:16:37.095
So man, okay, then you take verse 21, not only that,

352
00:16:37.095 --> 00:16:39.575
verse 21 says the, the Hebrews who had been

353
00:16:39.575 --> 00:16:42.175
with the Philistines before that time, who had gone up

354
00:16:42.175 --> 00:16:45.215
before them into the camp even, they also turned to be

355
00:16:45.325 --> 00:16:48.495
with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.

356
00:16:48.795 --> 00:16:52.375
So there was a group of people who revolted earlier, went

357
00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:53.455
to join the Philistines.

358
00:16:53.455 --> 00:16:55.135
They said, man, I'm not being a part of Israel anymore.

359
00:16:55.755 --> 00:16:56.935
I'm gonna go with the Philistines.

360
00:16:57.165 --> 00:16:58.855
That was part of what was happening.

361
00:16:58.855 --> 00:17:01.055
They were coming back onto the right side of things.

362
00:17:01.235 --> 00:17:02.855
Not only that, verse 22,

363
00:17:04.175 --> 00:17:05.455
likewise, when all the men

364
00:17:05.575 --> 00:17:08.415
of Israel who'd hidden themselves in the hill country heard

365
00:17:08.415 --> 00:17:12.055
that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard

366
00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:13.855
after them in the battle.

367
00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:17.335
So all those guys that ran away to begin with

368
00:17:18.355 --> 00:17:20.135
saw the battle was being successful.

369
00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.655
They came down and said, we're in it.

370
00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:23.015
We're getting courageous.

371
00:17:23.035 --> 00:17:25.135
Now, the victories on our side,

372
00:17:28.485 --> 00:17:30.705
it sure seems like the tides have turned.

373
00:17:35.275 --> 00:17:38.515
Maybe Saul will be the one

374
00:17:39.095 --> 00:17:43.035
to finally get this right, to defeat the Philistines,

375
00:17:43.215 --> 00:17:46.355
to finally obey God, to save the kingship.

376
00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:53.255
Seems like that's where it's going except

377
00:17:53.255 --> 00:17:54.735
for the way verse 23 reads.

378
00:17:57.225 --> 00:18:00.785
Look at it with me. It says, so the Lord

379
00:18:02.035 --> 00:18:03.705
saved Israel that day

380
00:18:05.225 --> 00:18:07.325
and the battle passed beyond Beth Haven,

381
00:18:07.745 --> 00:18:09.885
and it'll continue on into the next couple weeks.

382
00:18:12.195 --> 00:18:15.755
But think about it. Who actually got the credit

383
00:18:16.735 --> 00:18:18.155
for the victory here?

384
00:18:21.165 --> 00:18:25.905
Was it Saul who, who made some headway in this battle

385
00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:28.385
and it, it took him a while to catch on,

386
00:18:28.485 --> 00:18:30.025
but he got caught off guard initially.

387
00:18:30.245 --> 00:18:32.025
Was he the one who got credit for it? No.

388
00:18:34.345 --> 00:18:36.565
Was it even Jonathan? Right.

389
00:18:36.925 --> 00:18:39.285
Jonathan who initiated obedience.

390
00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.845
He said, we need to defeat the Philistines. God said.

391
00:18:41.845 --> 00:18:44.885
So he seemed very king like in his attitude and his faith.

392
00:18:45.145 --> 00:18:46.525
Was it Jonathan who got the credit?

393
00:18:47.545 --> 00:18:50.805
No, it was the Lord.

394
00:18:51.995 --> 00:18:56.415
Yahweh who got the credit for the victory here.

395
00:18:58.275 --> 00:19:01.215
God saved the Israelites here.

396
00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:03.725
No one else did.

397
00:19:07.035 --> 00:19:08.255
God saved them.

398
00:19:10.235 --> 00:19:11.815
And listen, this is so critical

399
00:19:11.815 --> 00:19:13.975
that the narrator recorded it this way

400
00:19:14.645 --> 00:19:18.015
because if it reads any other way,

401
00:19:19.315 --> 00:19:22.335
we might miss some important pieces of this narrative.

402
00:19:24.325 --> 00:19:27.865
But because it says God saved them, it takes our minds

403
00:19:27.865 --> 00:19:28.865
to a couple things here.

404
00:19:31.765 --> 00:19:35.795
We remember that Israel was surrounded by this enemy

405
00:19:35.795 --> 00:19:38.435
and it felt like a hopeless situation.

406
00:19:40.775 --> 00:19:43.475
We remember that Israel only had a couple hundred guys

407
00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:45.355
and they had farm tools for weapons.

408
00:19:49.345 --> 00:19:52.325
We remember that when Jonathan defeated just 20

409
00:19:52.505 --> 00:19:55.685
of the Philistine men, it sent the rest of the whole army

410
00:19:56.315 --> 00:20:01.095
into a panic, which by the way, God helped a little bit

411
00:20:01.355 --> 00:20:05.455
by sending an earthquake to increase the panic as they went.

412
00:20:08.595 --> 00:20:11.855
We also remember that that verse 20 says,

413
00:20:12.185 --> 00:20:16.175
every Philistine sword was against his fellow, meaning

414
00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:18.215
they were killing each other.

415
00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:20.415
They were so confused by everything, which is something

416
00:20:20.415 --> 00:20:23.375
by the way, that God did multiple times throughout the Old

417
00:20:23.575 --> 00:20:26.315
Testament, Gideon, with judges.

418
00:20:26.535 --> 00:20:28.995
We see it even earlier in one Samuel,

419
00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:33.835
that God would create such chaos that they couldn't help

420
00:20:33.895 --> 00:20:36.235
but kill each other in that enemy army.

421
00:20:38.335 --> 00:20:41.165
We remember all those things

422
00:20:41.165 --> 00:20:43.165
because it says that God got the credit.

423
00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:45.285
Saul didn't get the credit because we're about

424
00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:47.600
to see him get replaced in the next couple chapters.

425
00:20:49.345 --> 00:20:52.315
This was all leading up to Saul losing his kingship.

426
00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:53.915
He didn't get the credit. But the fact

427
00:20:53.915 --> 00:20:56.995
that God did get the credit is meant to remind us

428
00:20:57.185 --> 00:20:59.835
that there is only one true king

429
00:20:59.975 --> 00:21:03.395
and that he is actually all that we need in our lives.

430
00:21:05.315 --> 00:21:06.575
That's what this is supposed to show us.

431
00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:12.275
We're looking for a king, a savior. We don't need one.

432
00:21:12.925 --> 00:21:14.555
We've got one. Amen.

433
00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:19.545
So again, like I said, this battle will continue,

434
00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:21.225
this things will continue.

435
00:21:21.335 --> 00:21:23.745
Saul and Jonathan continue to get contrasted.

436
00:21:23.745 --> 00:21:26.785
We'll see new lineage come up in the next few weeks.

437
00:21:26.845 --> 00:21:31.365
But we've asked this question every week, okay,

438
00:21:31.385 --> 00:21:34.965
how do those principles play out in our daily lives?

439
00:21:36.705 --> 00:21:40.715
This moves us forward, teaches us a lot about what happened.

440
00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:45.755
But how are we to apply any of these principles today?

441
00:21:47.025 --> 00:21:50.035
What do we learn and how can we apply it in our context?

442
00:21:50.085 --> 00:21:52.475
These were ancient occurrences, but

443
00:21:52.495 --> 00:21:53.635
but what does it do for us?

444
00:21:55.435 --> 00:21:56.735
How does it apply today?

445
00:21:59.665 --> 00:22:01.815
Again, there can always be a few more you'd find.

446
00:22:01.915 --> 00:22:03.415
But the first principle is that we,

447
00:22:04.515 --> 00:22:07.415
we often see God use us

448
00:22:07.955 --> 00:22:09.815
to accomplish his work.

449
00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:13.995
God often uses us

450
00:22:16.045 --> 00:22:17.545
to accomplish his work.

451
00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:22.755
Here's, here's the foundational truth.

452
00:22:24.485 --> 00:22:28.065
God could have done all of this by himself, right?

453
00:22:28.725 --> 00:22:33.135
He could have done absolutely all of this by himself.

454
00:22:33.145 --> 00:22:35.575
We've already seen it even in First Samuel, right?

455
00:22:35.795 --> 00:22:39.215
Verses uh, chapters four through six, the arc

456
00:22:39.235 --> 00:22:40.855
of God travels

457
00:22:40.855 --> 00:22:43.415
through the Philistine area just bringing plagues.

458
00:22:43.435 --> 00:22:46.535
And people are, are overwhelmed by its presence

459
00:22:46.555 --> 00:22:48.935
and they, they get frogs and boils all kinds of stuff.

460
00:22:48.935 --> 00:22:51.945
Like we had nothing to do with that.

461
00:22:52.725 --> 00:22:55.465
Israel had nothing to, it was God by himself.

462
00:22:56.465 --> 00:22:58.255
First Samuel, chapter seven.

463
00:22:58.355 --> 00:23:02.815
The Lord sent thunder to confuse the Philistines back then

464
00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:05.135
so that they would begin defeating themselves.

465
00:23:05.235 --> 00:23:06.255
By the way, when you hear thunder

466
00:23:06.265 --> 00:23:07.615
today, don't get confused, right?

467
00:23:07.615 --> 00:23:08.775
It's still just we're okay.

468
00:23:10.115 --> 00:23:11.695
But that's what happened back then in

469
00:23:14.885 --> 00:23:18.865
we have to remember that God doesn't actually

470
00:23:19.375 --> 00:23:21.105
need us for anything.

471
00:23:23.465 --> 00:23:25.715
Acts 17 is clear, right? We don't need to feed him.

472
00:23:25.895 --> 00:23:28.675
We don't need to provide for him. He provides for us.

473
00:23:31.895 --> 00:23:33.195
So that's the foundational truth.

474
00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:35.555
God doesn't need us for anything yet.

475
00:23:36.735 --> 00:23:41.515
He often chooses to work through us to accomplish

476
00:23:42.225 --> 00:23:43.835
what He's ordained to happen.

477
00:23:45.995 --> 00:23:48.785
When you think about Jonathan, Jonathan

478
00:23:50.125 --> 00:23:51.705
was God's vessel to

479
00:23:52.265 --> 00:23:54.105
initiate the battle against the Philistines.

480
00:23:55.915 --> 00:23:57.855
God used the Israelite army

481
00:23:57.955 --> 00:23:59.695
to bring judgment on the Philistines.

482
00:24:02.075 --> 00:24:03.785
Again, he doesn't have to use us,

483
00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:08.945
but he graciously chooses to use us.

484
00:24:11.405 --> 00:24:12.455
Just think about it today,

485
00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:18.675
God could just sovereignly on his own,

486
00:24:18.985 --> 00:24:22.235
save someone from their sin in their room by themselves.

487
00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:24.875
Nobody involved. God could do it.

488
00:24:27.615 --> 00:24:30.795
But Romans 10 says, he uses you

489
00:24:30.975 --> 00:24:34.275
or he uses me to proclaim gospel hope to that person.

490
00:24:34.695 --> 00:24:38.795
So they believe he doesn't have to,

491
00:24:40.175 --> 00:24:42.275
but what a privilege to be able

492
00:24:42.275 --> 00:24:43.755
to share the gospel of someone and see them.

493
00:24:43.755 --> 00:24:48.425
Believe He could just grow someone's

494
00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:49.705
spiritually in their faith.

495
00:24:51.855 --> 00:24:53.555
He could just have them grow.

496
00:24:53.695 --> 00:24:55.675
But he often uses you

497
00:24:56.175 --> 00:25:00.315
or uses me to hold them accountable, to encourage them,

498
00:25:00.615 --> 00:25:02.955
to pray for them, to answer questions for them,

499
00:25:03.215 --> 00:25:04.395
to help them understand the Bible.

500
00:25:04.505 --> 00:25:06.235
Like that's what he does. That's how he works.

501
00:25:07.255 --> 00:25:11.955
He doesn't have to, but what a privilege it is to be able

502
00:25:11.955 --> 00:25:13.835
to be included in someone's growth process.

503
00:25:17.255 --> 00:25:20.275
He could just make someone feel welcomed here on a Sunday.

504
00:25:22.655 --> 00:25:25.745
Like you just walk in here and, and just feel this warmth

505
00:25:25.845 --> 00:25:27.945
and this greeting and all that.

506
00:25:27.965 --> 00:25:29.265
But, but he doesn't do that.

507
00:25:29.265 --> 00:25:30.985
He chooses to use you

508
00:25:31.165 --> 00:25:34.545
and me as vessels of his mercy to someone

509
00:25:34.685 --> 00:25:36.825
so they feel welcomed, they feel greeted,

510
00:25:36.825 --> 00:25:38.305
they feel warm here.

511
00:25:38.455 --> 00:25:40.305
Like this is a safe place for them here.

512
00:25:40.335 --> 00:25:41.825
Like he doesn't have to use us,

513
00:25:41.825 --> 00:25:44.105
but he chooses to use us for that.

514
00:25:47.865 --> 00:25:50.195
It's those simple things, but it's also bigger things.

515
00:25:51.415 --> 00:25:56.295
He could free a person

516
00:25:56.565 --> 00:25:58.015
from being trafficked,

517
00:25:59.415 --> 00:26:04.155
but he chooses to use someone committed to justice to see

518
00:26:04.155 --> 00:26:07.975
that happen and go for it and and fight for it.

519
00:26:10.815 --> 00:26:12.755
And as I say that, listen, as I wrote that one,

520
00:26:14.075 --> 00:26:15.805
I am right there with you

521
00:26:15.805 --> 00:26:19.405
that there are times I don't understand why God doesn't just

522
00:26:19.505 --> 00:26:20.805
do things like that on his own.

523
00:26:22.445 --> 00:26:24.065
Why does he allow that to continue?

524
00:26:24.065 --> 00:26:27.105
Like I, there's questions I have, I don't understand that.

525
00:26:28.325 --> 00:26:29.625
But here's what I know for certain.

526
00:26:30.265 --> 00:26:31.945
I don't know the answer to that. But here's why.

527
00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:36.745
I know for certain, he has given me commands to obey,

528
00:26:39.755 --> 00:26:42.615
to do justice, to love mercy, to walk humbly with my God,

529
00:26:42.615 --> 00:26:43.685
those kind of things, right?

530
00:26:43.835 --> 00:26:45.925
He's given me commands to obey.

531
00:26:46.185 --> 00:26:50.085
And in his sovereignty, he works through my obedience.

532
00:26:50.345 --> 00:26:52.965
He works through my willingness to get involved.

533
00:26:53.185 --> 00:26:56.165
He works through my growth of my faith

534
00:26:56.225 --> 00:26:58.325
and my actions to say, I'm gonna live this out.

535
00:26:58.505 --> 00:27:00.205
I'm gonna obey what he says. I'm gonna do

536
00:27:00.205 --> 00:27:01.285
what he wants me to do.

537
00:27:01.425 --> 00:27:03.365
That's how he works in the world.

538
00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:08.045
That's why when I asked the question at the beginning,

539
00:27:08.065 --> 00:27:09.325
do you feel worthless to God?

540
00:27:09.385 --> 00:27:12.205
That's why, for those of you who do feel worthless to God,

541
00:27:12.235 --> 00:27:13.485
hear me, you're not.

542
00:27:15.915 --> 00:27:18.055
You are not worthless to God.

543
00:27:19.385 --> 00:27:22.175
Every single one of us has the privilege

544
00:27:22.355 --> 00:27:27.315
of seeing God use our talents, our history,

545
00:27:29.035 --> 00:27:33.275
our passions, our obedience.

546
00:27:35.065 --> 00:27:38.485
We have the privilege of watching him use that for his glory

547
00:27:38.905 --> 00:27:40.725
and for other people's good.

548
00:27:41.905 --> 00:27:43.315
When you seek justice,

549
00:27:43.975 --> 00:27:47.115
and that's what comes of it, that's good for

550
00:27:47.115 --> 00:27:48.195
that person, right?

551
00:27:48.535 --> 00:27:53.445
As you obeyed God, he used you to deliver.

552
00:27:53.625 --> 00:27:55.525
He used you to preach the gospel

553
00:27:55.705 --> 00:27:56.885
to someone to see them save.

554
00:27:56.985 --> 00:27:59.085
He used you to help someone grow in their faith.

555
00:27:59.145 --> 00:28:01.925
He used you to make someone who's given it their last shot

556
00:28:01.925 --> 00:28:05.125
today on Sunday to make them finally feel welcome here.

557
00:28:05.185 --> 00:28:06.805
And they say, okay, I'm gonna give another shot.

558
00:28:09.495 --> 00:28:12.915
He graciously uses our lives to bless others,

559
00:28:13.495 --> 00:28:17.775
to accomplish his work, to bring his kingdom

560
00:28:17.955 --> 00:28:18.975
to bear on earth.

561
00:28:22.095 --> 00:28:23.915
And listen, I'm talking about your life too.

562
00:28:24.635 --> 00:28:29.105
Everyone of you, it says Grace.

563
00:28:29.775 --> 00:28:33.995
It's a privilege that he's included us in the process.

564
00:28:34.175 --> 00:28:35.355
So, so the question is,

565
00:28:36.015 --> 00:28:39.475
how are you opening your hands in your life saying,

566
00:28:39.575 --> 00:28:40.675
God, I'm all yours.

567
00:28:41.955 --> 00:28:44.875
What? What do you want? I'm yours.

568
00:28:47.095 --> 00:28:50.475
How do I obey you? How do I follow you? How do I seek you?

569
00:28:50.475 --> 00:28:51.875
First, your righteousness.

570
00:28:51.975 --> 00:28:54.315
And I want to, but I wanna be used by you.

571
00:28:55.115 --> 00:28:59.165
Whatever that means. He wants

572
00:28:59.385 --> 00:29:03.825
to use you and me to accomplish his will on this earth.

573
00:29:04.115 --> 00:29:05.425
We've gotta be open-handed about

574
00:29:05.565 --> 00:29:06.985
how he does that in our lives.

575
00:29:07.685 --> 00:29:12.545
But, but we have to remember the second principle

576
00:29:12.965 --> 00:29:16.535
as we say, that it has to be done in the spirit

577
00:29:16.635 --> 00:29:19.855
of this second principle, that as the Lord calls us

578
00:29:19.915 --> 00:29:22.775
to action, we must go in faith

579
00:29:25.315 --> 00:29:27.815
as the Lord calls us to action.

580
00:29:29.235 --> 00:29:31.455
We must go in faith

581
00:29:33.545 --> 00:29:36.395
because Saul was called to action,

582
00:29:37.215 --> 00:29:38.595
but he didn't go in faith, right?

583
00:29:41.525 --> 00:29:45.215
Jonathan did though. And what did God do

584
00:29:45.215 --> 00:29:46.335
with Jonathan's faith?

585
00:29:47.515 --> 00:29:50.175
God initiated the victory through Jonathan's faith.

586
00:29:52.285 --> 00:29:55.605
Jonathan trusted that nothing can hinder the Lord from

587
00:29:55.705 --> 00:29:58.365
saving by many people or by few people.

588
00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:01.965
Jonathan trusted that God could do that.

589
00:30:02.145 --> 00:30:05.845
And so God used that to show himself off in big ways.

590
00:30:09.615 --> 00:30:13.575
Now, I wanna be clear, 'cause I'm not saying

591
00:30:14.285 --> 00:30:17.775
that somehow we can manipulate God through our faith,

592
00:30:20.635 --> 00:30:24.525
that we can get him to do what we selfishly want him to do

593
00:30:25.725 --> 00:30:26.945
if we just believe enough.

594
00:30:30.335 --> 00:30:31.675
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

595
00:30:33.025 --> 00:30:36.035
Because God does what He does regardless of us.

596
00:30:36.175 --> 00:30:38.195
He does what he will do.

597
00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:43.395
What I'm talking about is us standing firm on the nature

598
00:30:43.615 --> 00:30:45.235
and character of God.

599
00:30:46.545 --> 00:30:48.605
That's where confident faith comes from.

600
00:30:50.025 --> 00:30:53.745
If you look at people in history around the world

601
00:30:53.845 --> 00:30:56.785
who are in incredibly difficult situations, have faced

602
00:30:57.465 --> 00:30:59.905
persecution, burned at the stake, whatever it is,

603
00:30:59.905 --> 00:31:02.505
like all these things, where did their confidence

604
00:31:02.505 --> 00:31:03.545
and faith come from?

605
00:31:04.565 --> 00:31:08.505
It came from knowing the nature and character of God.

606
00:31:08.735 --> 00:31:13.585
It's a solid, strong belief that God is who he says he is.

607
00:31:13.765 --> 00:31:16.105
And he will do what he says he will do.

608
00:31:17.215 --> 00:31:18.715
That's where that kind of faith comes from.

609
00:31:18.935 --> 00:31:21.875
You wonder like how, what would I be like if I'm faced with

610
00:31:22.515 --> 00:31:24.195
whatever is coming persecution?

611
00:31:24.345 --> 00:31:25.875
What would I, how would I respond?

612
00:31:26.415 --> 00:31:28.435
How you know is how do you believe

613
00:31:29.145 --> 00:31:30.755
that God is who he says he is?

614
00:31:30.815 --> 00:31:33.115
And He will do what he says he will do. Do you believe that?

615
00:31:34.875 --> 00:31:37.565
Even when we can't see it in the moment,

616
00:31:40.095 --> 00:31:42.065
even when that army think about it with

617
00:31:42.065 --> 00:31:43.105
with their story here, right?

618
00:31:43.215 --> 00:31:46.385
Even with the army completely surrounding us.

619
00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:50.155
Faith says, we believe God

620
00:31:50.345 --> 00:31:51.715
says he's gonna bring the victory.

621
00:31:55.585 --> 00:31:57.635
Hebrews 11, one says it really well.

622
00:31:58.795 --> 00:32:02.865
Faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction

623
00:32:02.885 --> 00:32:05.025
of things not seen.

624
00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:09.705
Listen, if you can see the way out,

625
00:32:10.705 --> 00:32:12.195
that doesn't take any faith, right?

626
00:32:15.215 --> 00:32:17.875
If you're walking blind through some situation,

627
00:32:18.015 --> 00:32:19.275
it takes faith to know

628
00:32:19.275 --> 00:32:20.875
that you're being led the right direction.

629
00:32:23.695 --> 00:32:26.565
Faith shows up when you only have a couple hundred guys left

630
00:32:26.675 --> 00:32:28.645
when you got farm tools for weapons.

631
00:32:29.425 --> 00:32:32.245
But you know what God has said?

632
00:32:34.025 --> 00:32:36.965
And you know that God said, attack the Philistines.

633
00:32:37.025 --> 00:32:40.365
And Jonathan said, all right, I'm in. Let's go.

634
00:32:41.445 --> 00:32:45.485
That's faith. And so listen, I know life

635
00:32:46.095 --> 00:32:48.405
might seem overwhelming at times.

636
00:32:50.315 --> 00:32:53.965
Like it might seem like the enemy is winning in your life

637
00:32:53.985 --> 00:32:55.085
or in the world around us.

638
00:32:55.085 --> 00:32:56.765
It might seem like that's true.

639
00:32:57.265 --> 00:32:59.125
You might be tempted to bail

640
00:32:59.235 --> 00:33:02.125
because it seems like God is late to the party.

641
00:33:02.425 --> 00:33:05.125
Or even worse, he's not good as he comes,

642
00:33:05.505 --> 00:33:06.965
you might be tempted to bail.

643
00:33:07.495 --> 00:33:11.545
Don't believe it. Keep going back

644
00:33:11.885 --> 00:33:15.505
to the promises of God's word to who he says he is, to

645
00:33:15.505 --> 00:33:16.985
what He says he will do to the

646
00:33:17.025 --> 00:33:18.505
promises he makes in his word.

647
00:33:18.885 --> 00:33:20.425
And stand firm on that.

648
00:33:24.365 --> 00:33:28.285
Continue to pray. Continue to serve, continue to obey,

649
00:33:28.925 --> 00:33:30.885
continue to do what God's called you to do.

650
00:33:31.625 --> 00:33:32.925
All of that in faith

651
00:33:35.605 --> 00:33:37.455
because you know God will do his work.

652
00:33:39.795 --> 00:33:41.015
It may not be on your timeline,

653
00:33:43.055 --> 00:33:44.375
probably won't be on your timeline,

654
00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:47.355
but you know God's gonna do it.

655
00:33:48.485 --> 00:33:51.865
You know he's promised and he will because of who he is.

656
00:33:53.605 --> 00:33:55.415
Because here's the third principle today

657
00:33:56.855 --> 00:34:01.095
that battle you face, it ultimately belongs to the Lord.

658
00:34:06.935 --> 00:34:10.045
Any battle and the final battle,

659
00:34:11.045 --> 00:34:12.625
it ultimately belongs to the Lord.

660
00:34:15.185 --> 00:34:18.645
Listen, if God is not behind something,

661
00:34:19.545 --> 00:34:22.845
it doesn't matter how big your army is,

662
00:34:23.425 --> 00:34:24.765
it will not succeed.

663
00:34:27.545 --> 00:34:31.495
But if God is behind something, then no matter

664
00:34:31.555 --> 00:34:34.655
how small your army is, it cannot fail.

665
00:34:35.125 --> 00:34:38.015
Amen. Right? That's what Romans 8 31 says.

666
00:34:38.355 --> 00:34:41.335
If God is for us, then who can be against us?

667
00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:46.055
'cause remember, it wasn't Saul, it wasn't Jonathan.

668
00:34:46.195 --> 00:34:47.895
It wasn't big uh, weapons.

669
00:34:48.275 --> 00:34:50.775
It wasn't a massive army that saved Israel that day.

670
00:34:50.875 --> 00:34:54.215
Who was it? It was God who saved Israel.

671
00:34:54.395 --> 00:34:56.815
Now, he called Saul and Jonathan to play a part in that.

672
00:34:57.415 --> 00:35:00.095
Absolutely. But all the credit went to the Lord.

673
00:35:02.625 --> 00:35:06.395
That is just as true in your life and in my life today.

674
00:35:09.095 --> 00:35:12.295
Anything good that I have comes from him.

675
00:35:14.335 --> 00:35:19.155
Any victory or healing you've seen in your life is

676
00:35:19.255 --> 00:35:21.235
all from his powerful hands

677
00:35:24.495 --> 00:35:27.265
that ought to keep us the most humble people on the planet,

678
00:35:29.485 --> 00:35:30.815
that we can't do anything.

679
00:35:30.815 --> 00:35:32.415
John 15 five, apart from him.

680
00:35:36.285 --> 00:35:40.445
Because the truth and the depth of this reality is this.

681
00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:43.005
Not only is he the daily warrior

682
00:35:43.195 --> 00:35:45.645
that we need in all the battles we face, everything,

683
00:35:45.905 --> 00:35:47.885
he is the one fighting the battles.

684
00:35:48.305 --> 00:35:51.165
He ultimately won the most important battle

685
00:35:51.275 --> 00:35:52.485
that we could ever face.

686
00:35:52.835 --> 00:35:54.405
That battle against sin

687
00:35:54.425 --> 00:35:57.565
and death that leads to our separation from him forever.

688
00:35:57.905 --> 00:35:58.905
Yes,

689
00:35:59.505 --> 00:36:00.505
Yes. See, that's a

690
00:36:00.505 --> 00:36:02.985
battle that some

691
00:36:02.985 --> 00:36:04.105
of these battles we face in our

692
00:36:04.105 --> 00:36:05.185
daily lives, we can overcome.

693
00:36:05.245 --> 00:36:06.265
We can win, we can do that.

694
00:36:06.265 --> 00:36:07.865
I've done that too many times in my life

695
00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:08.905
that I've leaned on myself

696
00:36:08.925 --> 00:36:10.745
and my strength to overcome whatever I'm facing.

697
00:36:11.255 --> 00:36:15.705
That is a battle that you and I could never win on our own.

698
00:36:15.935 --> 00:36:19.385
That enemy too strong, too overwhelming, too deep,

699
00:36:19.805 --> 00:36:22.585
but nothing is impossible for the Lord

700
00:36:24.545 --> 00:36:26.805
who sent his son to live, die,

701
00:36:26.905 --> 00:36:29.925
and resurrect in our place to defeat that enemy

702
00:36:29.925 --> 00:36:31.485
that we could never defeat.

703
00:36:31.665 --> 00:36:34.485
And he defeated that enemy completely on his own,

704
00:36:36.185 --> 00:36:41.125
didn't need us, couldn't use us, just did it on his own so

705
00:36:41.125 --> 00:36:43.045
that when we place our faith in him

706
00:36:43.225 --> 00:36:45.645
and his work for us, we are given

707
00:36:45.675 --> 00:36:47.725
that eternal victory once and for all.

708
00:36:47.725 --> 00:36:49.605
There's no other way we can get there.

709
00:36:49.785 --> 00:36:52.205
But he said, I want it for you.

710
00:36:54.515 --> 00:36:57.455
You see how joyful that should make us church.

711
00:36:58.735 --> 00:37:00.355
You see how life-giving, that is

712
00:37:01.605 --> 00:37:03.465
the battle we could never fight on our own.

713
00:37:03.525 --> 00:37:06.225
He won it for us. And he will give us the victory

714
00:37:06.415 --> 00:37:09.305
because he's won that battle for us.

715
00:37:11.735 --> 00:37:16.555
And since he's won it, then why do we worry about anything

716
00:37:16.555 --> 00:37:18.235
else that happens in this life?

717
00:37:19.885 --> 00:37:23.375
Like if he won that one that lasts forever?

718
00:37:23.915 --> 00:37:26.615
Why are we worried about political upheaval?

719
00:37:26.795 --> 00:37:29.095
Why are we worried about financial swings in our lives?

720
00:37:29.315 --> 00:37:31.895
Why are we worried about nation rising against nation?

721
00:37:32.495 --> 00:37:34.255
Why are we worried even about death?

722
00:37:34.965 --> 00:37:38.875
Amen. None of that

723
00:37:40.015 --> 00:37:44.855
can sway us because if you are

724
00:37:44.915 --> 00:37:49.255
his by faith, you are under his victory banner.

725
00:37:52.015 --> 00:37:54.075
And that's, that's not like conditional.

726
00:37:54.335 --> 00:37:56.835
That's not like, man, if whoever wins the election

727
00:37:56.855 --> 00:37:58.035
or whoever's got the bigger army,

728
00:37:58.035 --> 00:37:59.355
whoever, it's none of that.

729
00:37:59.545 --> 00:38:00.715
It's already printed.

730
00:38:02.915 --> 00:38:07.015
The victory banner is his. He is your hero.

731
00:38:07.515 --> 00:38:11.015
He is your king, he is your savior.

732
00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:16.535
So we don't have to be swayed by anything else in this life.

733
00:38:20.905 --> 00:38:22.255
Let's believe that together though.
