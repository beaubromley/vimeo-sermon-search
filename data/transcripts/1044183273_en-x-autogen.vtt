1
00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:20.245
Well, it's 2025.

2
00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:21.605
Happy cold New Year.

3
00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:24.845
Uh, it's glad to be together in this warm place today.

4
00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:27.125
There's always an air of anticipation around

5
00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:28.805
the turn of the calendar.

6
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:32.685
I, I hope that your eyes are fixed on the Lord

7
00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:35.485
for his purposes and plans for you this year

8
00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:37.725
and how you can follow him in it.

9
00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:39.365
I'm excited today, especially though

10
00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:43.205
because we're diving back into our He Shall Reign series

11
00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:44.645
through the book of one Samuel.

12
00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:46.125
We started this back in August.

13
00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:49.125
It's actually gonna take us all the way up until Easter,

14
00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:53.005
a total of 29 sermons through the book of one Samuel.

15
00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:54.725
So excited about that. If you're not already there,

16
00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:56.805
take your copy of God's word.

17
00:00:56.805 --> 00:01:00.885
Turn with me back to First Samuel in the Old Testament,

18
00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:02.845
first Samuel 17.

19
00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:04.765
You'll flip through the front of it.

20
00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:06.765
You'll find Joshua, then judges, then Ruth,

21
00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.325
and then first Samuel, chapter 17.

22
00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:10.685
Put a bookmark there. We'll be in that

23
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:11.685
for the next couple months.

24
00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:15.845
Uh, before we get into chapter 17 today though,

25
00:01:15.985 --> 00:01:17.325
that's quickly review.

26
00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:19.445
It's been a couple weeks since we were

27
00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:21.045
here, uh, in this book.

28
00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:23.045
So let's review where we've come so far.

29
00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:26.725
If you remember, God's people had been freed from slavery in

30
00:01:26.725 --> 00:01:29.005
Egypt and they had been wandering

31
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:30.045
the wilderness for 40 years.

32
00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:32.165
They finally entered into the Promised Land.

33
00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:36.085
Moses led them in and God had promised that to Abraham.

34
00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:37.245
He finally gave it to them

35
00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:40.325
and they were to be distinct in that land, both culturally

36
00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:43.965
and religiously as a way to reveal God to the world.

37
00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:46.885
He was their chosen people to reveal himself.

38
00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:50.405
He'd chosen them uniquely and he wanted to be their God

39
00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:53.125
and their king in every way in their lives.

40
00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.945
Yet as they entered the land, things continue to go bad.

41
00:01:57.245 --> 00:02:00.425
To worse, as people rebelled against God,

42
00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:01.665
they failed to love God.

43
00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:04.145
They failed to love each other In many ways, it led

44
00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:07.185
to chaos in the land and into that environment.

45
00:02:08.355 --> 00:02:11.625
After the Book of Judges was born, a boy named Samuel

46
00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:16.665
whose barren mother, Hannah, was blessed with this child

47
00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:18.585
and gave him back to the Lord and,

48
00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:20.585
and he grew up to be a prophet

49
00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:22.985
of renewal in the nation of Israel.

50
00:02:24.295 --> 00:02:26.195
And during the time that he was growing up

51
00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:29.555
and as he was leading, God proved himself over

52
00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:32.635
and over again that he would deliver his people.

53
00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:33.995
He had not abandoned them.

54
00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:37.035
He would defeat their enemies on his own in miraculous ways.

55
00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:40.555
He showed himself to his people that he's got them.

56
00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:45.625
Yet still the people became enamored

57
00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:47.665
with the nations around them.

58
00:02:50.455 --> 00:02:54.595
And instead of following Yahweh as their king,

59
00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:58.275
they rejected God as their king.

60
00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:00.685
And they instead asked

61
00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:02.645
for a king like everybody else around them.

62
00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:08.865
Now God acquiesced, he gave them what they asked for

63
00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:13.905
and he appointed a tall, impressive man named Saul

64
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:15.145
to be Israel's first king.

65
00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:21.285
Now, if you remember, the King's primary responsibility was

66
00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:24.645
to lead his people, to follow God,

67
00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.015
to lead them into battle.

68
00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:29.175
Yes, but to lead them to follow God's

69
00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:30.535
covenant responsibilities.

70
00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:34.135
And even though it wasn't ideal that God allowed them

71
00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:36.095
to have a king, that wasn't his plan to begin with.

72
00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:37.495
That's what he allowed.

73
00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:39.975
But, but God would still make it work if

74
00:03:39.975 --> 00:03:41.095
that king would follow him.

75
00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:47.105
Well, we saw Saul quickly reveal

76
00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:48.945
that his heart was not toward the Lord.

77
00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:53.015
So he was a mighty warrior.

78
00:03:53.235 --> 00:03:55.615
Yes, but God ultimately rejected Saul

79
00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:59.375
because Saul had rejected the Lord's authority.

80
00:04:02.315 --> 00:04:03.395
'cause God wanted a man

81
00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:04.995
after his own heart, a man

82
00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.035
who pursued his heart above all else.

83
00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:13.585
Which is why we left off in chapter 16 where that point was

84
00:04:14.445 --> 00:04:18.465
we saw God reject Saul and and looked past the exterior

85
00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:23.475
and anoint a young man named David whose heart was

86
00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:25.035
after God's.

87
00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:28.285
And so you've seen this chart

88
00:04:28.285 --> 00:04:30.445
before as we've walked through this journey,

89
00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:34.805
what we're gonna see today is that continuing shift

90
00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:36.805
from Saul to David.

91
00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:39.685
You see their paths cross.

92
00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:42.005
They're uh, aligned in some ways,

93
00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:44.045
but it's really a comparative journey.

94
00:04:44.715 --> 00:04:47.125
It's gonna take us through the rest of one Samuel,

95
00:04:47.275 --> 00:04:48.565
between Saul and David.

96
00:04:48.675 --> 00:04:51.765
They will just be contrasted the entire book.

97
00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:57.725
And to kick us off in one Samuel again is one

98
00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:01.005
of the most familiar scenes in the Bible known

99
00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:02.565
as David and Goliath.

100
00:05:03.825 --> 00:05:07.645
Now this is one of the most well-known stories even

101
00:05:07.665 --> 00:05:09.085
by people who aren't Christians.

102
00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:12.285
It's one of the most basic stories that people know.

103
00:05:12.285 --> 00:05:13.965
The foundation know the skeleton of it.

104
00:05:13.965 --> 00:05:16.685
You hear it on sports center every time the number one team

105
00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:18.005
takes on the underdog, right?

106
00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:20.485
It's David and Goliath. That's, it's just well known.

107
00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:24.815
The basics of it at least are, But

108
00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:28.895
what does the Bible emphasize in this narrative?

109
00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:31.595
Okay, we know some of the story,

110
00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:34.555
but what does the Bible, why is it in here?

111
00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:36.355
Why is this story in here?

112
00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:41.495
Did God include this just merely to give us content

113
00:05:41.715 --> 00:05:46.535
for a locker room speech Or to

114
00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:49.095
give you some courage against

115
00:05:49.095 --> 00:05:50.375
that addiction that you're faced?

116
00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:54.185
Or to say, man, this year's gonna be the year

117
00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:57.025
that I finally follow through on that new year resolution

118
00:05:57.755 --> 00:06:00.005
that I abandoned every January 8th, every uh,

119
00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:01.365
you know like is this gonna be the year

120
00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:02.685
David and Goliath, my story?

121
00:06:02.685 --> 00:06:04.285
Like is that why this is here?

122
00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:10.885
Well let's walk through it and we'll see one Samuel 17.

123
00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:15.125
Now the narrator recorded this in a way that builds tension.

124
00:06:16.745 --> 00:06:17.925
So we're not gonna read the whole thing.

125
00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:20.325
We're gonna read it in pieces and talk about it in pieces

126
00:06:20.325 --> 00:06:23.365
because you'll see why it's recorded the way

127
00:06:23.365 --> 00:06:24.405
it is a piece at a time.

128
00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:26.605
So first here it is the setting.

129
00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:30.365
Uh, the first couple of verses show us the setting

130
00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:34.005
of the whole thing verses one through three.

131
00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:39.335
Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle

132
00:06:40.155 --> 00:06:43.335
and they were gathered at Soko, which belongs to Judah

133
00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:46.815
and encamped between Soko and E Zika in Eim

134
00:06:47.915 --> 00:06:49.695
and Saul and the men of Israel were gathered

135
00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:51.455
and encamped in the valley of Elah

136
00:06:51.675 --> 00:06:54.735
and drew up in a line of battle against the Philistines.

137
00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:57.575
And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side

138
00:06:57.835 --> 00:07:00.015
and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side

139
00:07:00.365 --> 00:07:01.895
with a valley between them.

140
00:07:03.475 --> 00:07:05.735
Now you're gonna see a map up on the screen here.

141
00:07:05.765 --> 00:07:08.455
It's maybe hard to see what's going on fully,

142
00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:10.175
but basically what you need to know is

143
00:07:10.175 --> 00:07:12.495
that the Philistines were making an incursion

144
00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:14.375
into the land of Israel.

145
00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:15.375
They were trying to take over.

146
00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:17.655
And so it ended up in this valley

147
00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:20.335
where the armies were camped on the

148
00:07:20.335 --> 00:07:21.575
either side of the valley.

149
00:07:21.635 --> 00:07:23.735
So if you don't know what that looks like, think

150
00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:26.455
of two stands at a football field

151
00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:28.655
where one team's on one side,

152
00:07:28.655 --> 00:07:30.735
their fans are all on this side and it's on the other side

153
00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:31.815
and there's a field between them.

154
00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:34.255
So that's kinda the picture. Philistines

155
00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:36.295
and Israelites on either side with a valley between,

156
00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:37.575
they can both see each other

157
00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:39.695
and they can see the battlefield.

158
00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:42.175
That's where we're at with the setting.

159
00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:47.815
Which leads us to the challenge. This is the challenge.

160
00:07:47.845 --> 00:07:50.175
That setting is in your head. You've got the picture.

161
00:07:51.795 --> 00:07:55.215
Now watch the challenge get laid down by the Philistines.

162
00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:58.375
They were trying to overtake Israel.

163
00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:01.735
They opposed God, they opposed his people.

164
00:08:01.825 --> 00:08:03.815
Watch the challenge that's laid out here,

165
00:08:03.955 --> 00:08:05.175
verses four through 11.

166
00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:11.115
And there came out from the camp of the Philistines,

167
00:08:11.235 --> 00:08:13.635
a champion named Goliath of goth

168
00:08:14.525 --> 00:08:17.195
whose height was six cubits in a span.

169
00:08:17.215 --> 00:08:18.755
Now we have no idea what that is, right?

170
00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:21.755
It's roughly, let's say about nine feet, nine

171
00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:22.915
to nine and a half feet tall.

172
00:08:24.335 --> 00:08:26.035
He had a helmet of bronze on his head.

173
00:08:26.495 --> 00:08:28.355
He was armed with a coat of male

174
00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:32.035
and the weight of the coat was 5,000 shekels of bronze.

175
00:08:32.205 --> 00:08:35.675
Again unfamiliar. It's about 125 pounds.

176
00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:39.505
And he had bronze armor on his legs

177
00:08:39.605 --> 00:08:42.305
and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.

178
00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.225
The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam,

179
00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:47.025
meaning a thick piece of wood.

180
00:08:47.245 --> 00:08:51.625
And his spear's head weighed 600 shekels of iron.

181
00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:53.425
That's about 15 pounds.

182
00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:56.405
So his spear, just the head of it, weighed about 15 pounds

183
00:08:57.985 --> 00:08:59.845
And his shield bearer went before him.

184
00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:03.685
He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel,

185
00:09:04.105 --> 00:09:06.205
why have you come out to draw up for battle?

186
00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:09.805
Am I not a Philistine? And are you not servants of Saul?

187
00:09:11.195 --> 00:09:14.255
Choose a man for yourselves. Let him come down to me.

188
00:09:14.635 --> 00:09:16.055
If he's able to fight with me

189
00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.295
and kill me, then we will be your servants.

190
00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:20.455
But if I prevail against him

191
00:09:20.475 --> 00:09:23.855
and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.

192
00:09:25.175 --> 00:09:29.195
The Philistines said, I defy the ranks of Israel this day.

193
00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:31.435
Give me a man that we may fight together.

194
00:09:33.295 --> 00:09:35.585
When Saul and all Israel heard these words

195
00:09:35.605 --> 00:09:39.305
of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.

196
00:09:41.985 --> 00:09:43.325
Now let's just give them some credit.

197
00:09:43.465 --> 00:09:46.085
Do you see why they were dismayed here?

198
00:09:47.035 --> 00:09:51.125
It's why it's David and Goliath the giant. He's this mass.

199
00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.325
Look at the picture of strength

200
00:09:53.585 --> 00:09:57.405
and power it gives us of this mountain of a man

201
00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:00.165
who has the latest

202
00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:02.925
military technology all over his body

203
00:10:03.225 --> 00:10:04.405
in front of him, on him.

204
00:10:04.665 --> 00:10:07.965
He is the picture of worldly strength.

205
00:10:11.685 --> 00:10:13.465
But don't miss something critical here.

206
00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:18.575
See Saul and and notice Goliath mentions him a couple times,

207
00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.935
Saul as the king of Israel.

208
00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:25.015
He was the one charged with

209
00:10:25.965 --> 00:10:27.575
leading his people into battle.

210
00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:32.015
Which means if the other side sent out a champion on a A

211
00:10:32.015 --> 00:10:35.895
representative, it was his job to take that challenge

212
00:10:38.045 --> 00:10:40.025
to accept the challenge on behalf of Israel.

213
00:10:42.635 --> 00:10:43.935
Yet what did verse 11 say?

214
00:10:45.415 --> 00:10:47.235
It specifically said, Saul

215
00:10:47.575 --> 00:10:50.115
and all Israel we're greatly afraid.

216
00:10:53.985 --> 00:10:57.805
That's why in verse 12, we are immediately introduced,

217
00:10:58.405 --> 00:10:59.725
reintroduced really to the person

218
00:11:00.195 --> 00:11:03.405
that throughout one Samuel plays the contrasting role

219
00:11:03.785 --> 00:11:06.325
to Saul, the one

220
00:11:06.325 --> 00:11:08.925
who was anointed back in chapter 16 as the king.

221
00:11:08.925 --> 00:11:11.605
We've already known his name. His name is David.

222
00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:17.815
Now David is the youth referred to throughout this passage

223
00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:19.935
and really other passages.

224
00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:23.415
Remember David the shepherd's son of Jesse

225
00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:25.655
from the little town of Bethlehem.

226
00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:28.295
That was who David was.

227
00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:32.175
Here's where he enters into the story. Watch this.

228
00:11:32.485 --> 00:11:36.575
This is verses 12 down through 30 and it all fits together.

229
00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:39.175
Watch carefully as I read this

230
00:11:42.885 --> 00:11:46.545
Now verse 12 starts with now that's meaning to contrast

231
00:11:46.545 --> 00:11:47.945
what just happened with what's here.

232
00:11:48.045 --> 00:11:50.705
Now David was the son of Anite

233
00:11:50.925 --> 00:11:53.885
of Bethlehem in Judah named Jesse

234
00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:56.605
who had eight sons in the days of Saul.

235
00:11:56.605 --> 00:11:57.885
The man was already old

236
00:11:58.145 --> 00:12:00.645
and advanced in years talking about his father.

237
00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:02.485
The three oldest sons

238
00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:04.605
of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle.

239
00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:06.725
The names of his three sons who went

240
00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:08.165
to the battle were Elia of the firstborn.

241
00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:11.005
Next to him had be Aada and the third Shema.

242
00:12:11.695 --> 00:12:14.645
David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul.

243
00:12:14.645 --> 00:12:16.525
But David went back and forth from Saul

244
00:12:16.525 --> 00:12:19.045
to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.

245
00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:22.885
And for 40 days going back to the scene for 40 days,

246
00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:25.885
the Philistine came forward, took his stand morning

247
00:12:26.065 --> 00:12:30.795
and evening, and Jesse said to David, his son,

248
00:12:30.955 --> 00:12:33.675
take for your brothers an iffa of this parched grain,

249
00:12:33.835 --> 00:12:36.275
a container, a bushel, and these 10 loaves

250
00:12:36.275 --> 00:12:38.195
and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.

251
00:12:38.585 --> 00:12:41.515
Also take these 10 cheeses to the commander of the thousand.

252
00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:44.715
See if your brothers are, well bring some token from them.

253
00:12:46.655 --> 00:12:47.795
Now Saul and they

254
00:12:47.855 --> 00:12:49.515
and all the men of Israel were in the valley

255
00:12:49.715 --> 00:12:51.435
of Elah fighting with the Philistines.

256
00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:54.315
David Rose early in the morning, left the sheep

257
00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:55.995
with a keeper, took the provisions

258
00:12:55.995 --> 00:12:57.755
and went as Jesse had commanded him.

259
00:12:58.335 --> 00:13:00.995
And he came to the encampment as the host was going out

260
00:13:00.995 --> 00:13:02.955
to the battle line, shouting the war cry.

261
00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:05.435
And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle.

262
00:13:05.665 --> 00:13:06.755
Army against army.

263
00:13:07.485 --> 00:13:09.475
David left the things in charge of the keeper

264
00:13:09.475 --> 00:13:11.475
of the baggage, ran to the ranks and went

265
00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:12.555
and greeted his brothers.

266
00:13:13.575 --> 00:13:15.955
And as he talked with them, behold the champion,

267
00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:18.515
the Philistine of Gath Goliath by name,

268
00:13:18.945 --> 00:13:20.675
came up outta the ranks of the Philistines,

269
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.555
spoke the same words as before.

270
00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:26.925
And David heard him, all the men of Israel.

271
00:13:27.615 --> 00:13:29.005
Verse 24, all the men

272
00:13:29.005 --> 00:13:31.405
of Israel when they saw the man fled from him

273
00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:33.085
and were much afraid.

274
00:13:34.185 --> 00:13:35.285
And the men of Israel said,

275
00:13:35.285 --> 00:13:38.645
have you seen this man who's come up like this is kind

276
00:13:38.645 --> 00:13:40.005
of the rumor going through the camp.

277
00:13:40.035 --> 00:13:41.485
Have you seen this man who's come up?

278
00:13:41.485 --> 00:13:43.165
Surely he has come up to defy Israel

279
00:13:43.585 --> 00:13:46.405
and the king will enrich the man who kills him

280
00:13:46.595 --> 00:13:49.205
with great riches and will give him his daughter

281
00:13:49.265 --> 00:13:51.605
and make his father's house free in Israel.

282
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:55.255
And David said to the men who stood by him,

283
00:13:56.175 --> 00:13:58.095
'cause David just showed up, David hadn't heard much.

284
00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:00.615
What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine,

285
00:14:00.615 --> 00:14:01.975
takes away their approach from Israel.

286
00:14:02.315 --> 00:14:05.295
Who is this uncircumcised Philistine

287
00:14:05.525 --> 00:14:08.375
that he should defy the armies of the living God.

288
00:14:09.805 --> 00:14:11.345
And the people answered him the same way.

289
00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:13.465
So shall it be done to the man who kills him.

290
00:14:15.005 --> 00:14:18.465
Now Eli, the oldest brother, hell heard when he spoke

291
00:14:18.465 --> 00:14:20.065
to the men, heard David say what he said.

292
00:14:20.565 --> 00:14:22.625
And Eli's anger was kindled against David.

293
00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:24.385
And he said, why have you come down?

294
00:14:24.535 --> 00:14:27.225
With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?

295
00:14:27.865 --> 00:14:29.025
I know your presumption

296
00:14:29.165 --> 00:14:30.425
and the evil of your heart

297
00:14:30.445 --> 00:14:32.065
for you've come down to see the battle.

298
00:14:33.485 --> 00:14:36.625
And David said, what have I done? Was it not? But a word?

299
00:14:37.285 --> 00:14:38.665
He turned away from him toward another,

300
00:14:38.675 --> 00:14:40.985
spoke in the same way and the people answered him again

301
00:14:41.125 --> 00:14:42.345
as before her.

302
00:14:45.055 --> 00:14:47.435
So you saw what was happening.

303
00:14:47.435 --> 00:14:49.075
David finally ends up at the battle.

304
00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:50.395
David hears what's going on

305
00:14:50.615 --> 00:14:53.365
and apparently King Saul, instead

306
00:14:53.365 --> 00:14:55.565
of accepting the challenge from Goliath,

307
00:14:55.825 --> 00:14:58.285
he had instead tried to bribe a bunch of other people

308
00:14:58.305 --> 00:15:00.405
to say, Hey, somebody's gotta take this guy on.

309
00:15:00.745 --> 00:15:02.685
Why don't you do it? Here's, I'm gonna give you all kinds

310
00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:04.085
of rewards if you would do it right.

311
00:15:04.085 --> 00:15:06.445
Instead of saying, I'm gonna do this myself.

312
00:15:06.465 --> 00:15:08.805
And what was the response? It was crickets, right?

313
00:15:08.805 --> 00:15:11.285
Nobody said, I'll, I'll do it. Right? Nobody did.

314
00:15:11.515 --> 00:15:12.645
They were all running and hiding.

315
00:15:15.805 --> 00:15:20.005
Yet this time, morning and evening, he kept showing up

316
00:15:20.005 --> 00:15:21.405
and challenging the people.

317
00:15:21.635 --> 00:15:24.745
This time though something for the first time

318
00:15:25.485 --> 00:15:26.665
we see a different response.

319
00:15:29.505 --> 00:15:33.595
David's there. He hears what Philistine this Goliath said.

320
00:15:34.835 --> 00:15:37.175
And what did he say in verse 26? Look again.

321
00:15:40.145 --> 00:15:42.285
Who is this uncircumcised Philistine

322
00:15:43.035 --> 00:15:46.965
that he should defy the armies of the living God.

323
00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:51.945
See that for the first time

324
00:15:53.665 --> 00:15:57.185
a theological interpretation is introduced to this battle.

325
00:15:59.955 --> 00:16:03.595
Saul was supposed to have that they were all

326
00:16:03.655 --> 00:16:06.355
as Israel supposed to have that kind of perspective.

327
00:16:07.775 --> 00:16:10.515
But only when David shows up for the first time.

328
00:16:10.695 --> 00:16:13.115
And as much as his older brothers were looking down on him,

329
00:16:13.355 --> 00:16:16.635
'cause he was young, he just wanted to see the battle.

330
00:16:16.735 --> 00:16:17.795
He is just a little kid.

331
00:16:19.835 --> 00:16:22.225
David was the only one with enough sense

332
00:16:22.365 --> 00:16:25.025
to rightly understand what was happening here.

333
00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:34.175
Well, obviously word would begin to spread that this youth,

334
00:16:35.075 --> 00:16:37.255
he had an edge that no one else seemed to have.

335
00:16:38.345 --> 00:16:43.015
Well, that news finally made it to Saul, to King Saul

336
00:16:43.575 --> 00:16:48.285
actually the one supposed to have courageous faith,

337
00:16:49.135 --> 00:16:51.605
which by the way, that's why we put it in quotes here,

338
00:16:52.355 --> 00:16:57.205
because in no way at any point in this narrative does

339
00:16:57.315 --> 00:16:59.445
Saul act like a proper king of Israel.

340
00:17:01.265 --> 00:17:06.075
It's just he doesn't show anything but a position.

341
00:17:06.135 --> 00:17:07.875
He, he was in the position,

342
00:17:08.015 --> 00:17:11.955
but he had no power of king of Israel.

343
00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:16.115
And we'll see it here. Look at verses 31 through 37.

344
00:17:18.795 --> 00:17:21.895
It says, when the words that David spoke were heard,

345
00:17:22.285 --> 00:17:24.935
they repeated them before Saul and he sent for him.

346
00:17:25.515 --> 00:17:26.895
And David said to Saul,

347
00:17:27.275 --> 00:17:29.455
let no man's heart fail because of him.

348
00:17:30.645 --> 00:17:33.215
Your servant will go and fight, meaning I'll do it.

349
00:17:33.435 --> 00:17:34.815
Go and fight the Philistine.

350
00:17:35.795 --> 00:17:37.655
And Saul said to David, you're not able

351
00:17:37.655 --> 00:17:39.455
to go against this Philistine to fight with him.

352
00:17:39.555 --> 00:17:42.695
You're but a youth. He's been a man of war from his youth.

353
00:17:44.215 --> 00:17:46.355
But David said to Saul, your servant used

354
00:17:46.355 --> 00:17:47.675
to keep sheep for his father.

355
00:17:48.015 --> 00:17:50.405
And when there came a lion or a bear

356
00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:53.165
and took a lamb from the flock, I went after him

357
00:17:53.265 --> 00:17:55.805
and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth.

358
00:17:56.265 --> 00:17:59.165
And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard

359
00:17:59.265 --> 00:18:00.845
and struck him and killed him.

360
00:18:01.395 --> 00:18:03.765
Your servant has struck down both lions and bears

361
00:18:03.825 --> 00:18:07.285
and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them

362
00:18:07.625 --> 00:18:09.845
for he has defied the armies of the living God.

363
00:18:10.545 --> 00:18:13.205
And David said, the Lord who delivered me from the paw

364
00:18:13.205 --> 00:18:14.405
of the lion and from the paw

365
00:18:14.405 --> 00:18:16.445
of the bear will deliver me from the hand

366
00:18:16.445 --> 00:18:17.445
of this Philistine.

367
00:18:18.455 --> 00:18:21.675
And Saul said to David, go and the Lord be with you.

368
00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:27.375
Now again, I've told you the contrast is the whole book

369
00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:30.735
of first Samuel between Saul and David here again, more

370
00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:32.855
and more we see the contrast.

371
00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:36.375
Saul heard David's speech

372
00:18:36.635 --> 00:18:38.695
and he's trying to quench David's faith.

373
00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:43.535
Now you can't do that. And David instead responds with

374
00:18:43.535 --> 00:18:45.015
how he killed lions and bears.

375
00:18:45.015 --> 00:18:46.495
He's like, I'm not scared of this thing.

376
00:18:47.805 --> 00:18:50.985
But notice again, it wasn't just David had this courage

377
00:18:51.015 --> 00:18:52.145
that none of us could have.

378
00:18:52.855 --> 00:18:56.905
David's heart was towards the Lord. Watch his perspective.

379
00:18:56.965 --> 00:18:58.225
That's so God focused.

380
00:18:58.365 --> 00:19:02.945
He says, the Lord delivered me from those killer animals

381
00:19:03.525 --> 00:19:06.985
and the same Lord will deliver me from Goliath.

382
00:19:07.485 --> 00:19:11.805
Two. It wasn't that David felt so confident in himself.

383
00:19:12.265 --> 00:19:14.365
It was like, look, the Lord did this there,

384
00:19:15.465 --> 00:19:16.685
why wouldn't the Lord do this here?

385
00:19:18.995 --> 00:19:20.725
There's even further contrast.

386
00:19:20.725 --> 00:19:23.085
Look next verses 38 through 40,

387
00:19:26.245 --> 00:19:30.375
then Saul, as he says, okay David, you're up.

388
00:19:30.645 --> 00:19:32.975
Then Saul clothed David with his armor.

389
00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.455
He put a helmet of bronze on his head

390
00:19:35.455 --> 00:19:36.895
and clothed him with a coat of mail.

391
00:19:36.955 --> 00:19:40.735
And David strapped his sword over his armor and he tried in.

392
00:19:40.735 --> 00:19:42.815
David tried in vain to go

393
00:19:44.185 --> 00:19:45.885
for he had not tested them.

394
00:19:47.475 --> 00:19:49.605
Then David said to sa, I cannot go with these.

395
00:19:49.715 --> 00:19:52.725
I've not tested them. And so David took them off

396
00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:55.685
and he took his staff in his hand, a long stick

397
00:19:56.025 --> 00:19:58.885
and he chose five smooth stones from the brook.

398
00:19:59.425 --> 00:20:01.085
And he put them in his shepherd's pouch.

399
00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:05.365
His sling was in his hand and he approached the Philistine.

400
00:20:07.925 --> 00:20:11.065
Now it seems like in your head you're thinking this little

401
00:20:11.125 --> 00:20:13.465
boy putting on armor it, it probably wasn't

402
00:20:13.465 --> 00:20:16.465
that David was probably a a grown man

403
00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:17.585
in some form at this point.

404
00:20:17.645 --> 00:20:19.585
So it wasn't like he was too, it was too big.

405
00:20:19.605 --> 00:20:20.905
It just, he'd never used it before.

406
00:20:21.245 --> 00:20:24.025
He didn't know how to use the military armor.

407
00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:25.385
But, but I want you to see this.

408
00:20:26.445 --> 00:20:28.745
Notice where Saul's mind went

409
00:20:29.705 --> 00:20:31.105
whenever David was about to go to the battle.

410
00:20:33.035 --> 00:20:37.895
Saul's mind first went to the same military technology

411
00:20:37.895 --> 00:20:42.575
that he saw on Goliath or that he trusted in himself.

412
00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:44.695
He went to that that everybody else

413
00:20:45.595 --> 00:20:47.645
trusts in when they to a battle.

414
00:20:52.055 --> 00:20:56.905
Do you remember though how David had defeated the lion in

415
00:20:56.905 --> 00:20:58.225
the bear earlier in his life?

416
00:21:00.035 --> 00:21:01.495
Was it with swords and armor

417
00:21:01.675 --> 00:21:03.455
and all of the military technology?

418
00:21:03.835 --> 00:21:05.295
No. Now

419
00:21:05.295 --> 00:21:07.015
as a shepherd he probably would've had a a staff

420
00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:08.215
along stick and a club.

421
00:21:08.315 --> 00:21:10.815
That's most likely what he had. Yes.

422
00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:13.455
But remember who he attributed victory to?

423
00:21:13.715 --> 00:21:15.095
He said it was the Lord

424
00:21:15.515 --> 00:21:17.495
who delivered him from those animals.

425
00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:22.265
David had trusted God to do

426
00:21:22.265 --> 00:21:24.535
that here.

427
00:21:25.155 --> 00:21:28.935
He trusted God to give the victory over Goliath.

428
00:21:30.515 --> 00:21:33.135
He didn't trust a sword or armor or anything like that.

429
00:21:33.275 --> 00:21:36.135
He trusted God would do it again just like he did it in the

430
00:21:36.135 --> 00:21:37.175
wilderness with those animals.

431
00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:41.525
He would do it again. And so see again the contrast.

432
00:21:41.635 --> 00:21:43.245
Instead of leading his people

433
00:21:43.245 --> 00:21:47.045
to trust Yahweh in battle in life as he should,

434
00:21:47.635 --> 00:21:51.205
king Saul was just as afraid as anyone else,

435
00:21:51.485 --> 00:21:52.885
trusting the ways of the world

436
00:21:52.885 --> 00:21:54.565
and the things of the world like anybody else.

437
00:21:57.575 --> 00:22:01.945
But David went in the strength of the Lord alone.

438
00:22:04.985 --> 00:22:06.955
Saul was supposed to. David did it.

439
00:22:08.455 --> 00:22:13.155
And so as young David assumed the role of champion

440
00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:18.005
for Israel and he moves onto the battlefield in this moment.

441
00:22:18.135 --> 00:22:20.725
Think back to the description of Goliath, right?

442
00:22:21.785 --> 00:22:25.205
The giant, this mountain of a man armed to the teeth

443
00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:29.725
defended in every way possible that you can as a human.

444
00:22:30.105 --> 00:22:32.765
He is this huge figure imposing.

445
00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:37.655
And here comes David a stick in his hand,

446
00:22:38.615 --> 00:22:39.735
a sling in his hand,

447
00:22:40.115 --> 00:22:43.855
and five, probably tennis ball sized rocks in his pouch.

448
00:22:47.305 --> 00:22:48.605
But I want us to be careful here

449
00:22:48.605 --> 00:22:53.045
because we can get distracted really quickly by

450
00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:57.485
comparative size, military technology,

451
00:22:58.165 --> 00:23:00.445
whatever we think like we, we can just focus on that.

452
00:23:04.325 --> 00:23:05.775
There's a confrontation here.

453
00:23:07.205 --> 00:23:09.825
And as we watch this confrontation play out,

454
00:23:12.585 --> 00:23:16.605
we need to focus on the means employed to gain the victory

455
00:23:18.995 --> 00:23:21.815
not on anything that some painting might draw our mind to

456
00:23:21.815 --> 00:23:26.535
with David and Goliath in this confrontation

457
00:23:28.595 --> 00:23:31.845
Goliath and everyone else

458
00:23:33.175 --> 00:23:37.095
we're trusting in one thing while David

459
00:23:37.635 --> 00:23:40.495
was trusting something completely different.

460
00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:45.645
Look at this verses 41 through 43

461
00:23:49.505 --> 00:23:51.245
and the Philistine moved forward

462
00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:53.245
and came near to David

463
00:23:53.315 --> 00:23:54.925
with his shield bearer in front of him.

464
00:23:55.145 --> 00:23:56.525
And when the Philistine looked

465
00:23:56.625 --> 00:24:01.205
and saw David, he disdained him for he was but a youth ruddy

466
00:24:01.205 --> 00:24:02.805
and handsome in appearance.

467
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:06.805
And the Philistine said to David, am I a dog

468
00:24:07.075 --> 00:24:09.125
that you would come to me with sticks?

469
00:24:09.585 --> 00:24:13.405
And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.

470
00:24:15.275 --> 00:24:16.975
Now I wanna stop there for a second.

471
00:24:19.485 --> 00:24:22.645
'cause you see, Goliath brought a theological

472
00:24:22.645 --> 00:24:24.325
understanding to the battle as well.

473
00:24:28.535 --> 00:24:31.825
Back in this time there was this understanding that

474
00:24:32.385 --> 00:24:35.585
military battles were competition between gods.

475
00:24:38.065 --> 00:24:41.605
And so Goliath, knowing he had a home field advantage,

476
00:24:41.945 --> 00:24:45.965
he was superior in every way he knew his gods

477
00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:50.135
had no problem with this little youth.

478
00:24:54.035 --> 00:24:57.775
See, this wasn't just about swords

479
00:24:57.775 --> 00:24:59.295
and military technology here.

480
00:25:01.855 --> 00:25:05.945
This was a way for God to show off.

481
00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:13.795
This was a competition in a way between Gods.

482
00:25:15.535 --> 00:25:18.395
And so the fact that Goliath also brought a theological

483
00:25:18.395 --> 00:25:20.795
interpretation here shows us that

484
00:25:20.795 --> 00:25:22.475
that's the root of this whole thing.

485
00:25:25.115 --> 00:25:28.295
And so while it may have appeared on the outside

486
00:25:28.805 --> 00:25:31.335
that David brought a knife to a gunfight here,

487
00:25:32.855 --> 00:25:36.485
watch David's true weapon show up here in verses

488
00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:38.005
44 through 47.

489
00:25:38.635 --> 00:25:41.605
This is probably almost my favorite

490
00:25:41.605 --> 00:25:42.685
passage in the whole scripture.

491
00:25:42.735 --> 00:25:47.525
Watch this. The Philistine said to David, come to me.

492
00:25:47.965 --> 00:25:50.125
I will give your flesh to the birds of the air

493
00:25:50.345 --> 00:25:51.685
and to the beasts of the field.

494
00:25:52.515 --> 00:25:55.445
Then David said to the Philistine, you come to me

495
00:25:55.445 --> 00:25:58.245
with a sword, with a spear and with a javelin.

496
00:25:58.385 --> 00:26:02.565
But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God

497
00:26:02.565 --> 00:26:06.445
of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied this day,

498
00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:09.045
the Lord will deliver you into my hand

499
00:26:09.345 --> 00:26:11.925
and I will strike you down and cut off your head.

500
00:26:12.225 --> 00:26:14.005
And I will give the dead bodies of the host

501
00:26:14.025 --> 00:26:16.725
to the Philistines this day, to the birds of the air,

502
00:26:16.905 --> 00:26:20.405
to the wild beast of the earth that all the earth may know

503
00:26:20.405 --> 00:26:22.245
that there is a God in Israel

504
00:26:22.465 --> 00:26:26.925
and that all this assembly may know that the Lord saves not

505
00:26:26.925 --> 00:26:30.805
with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's.

506
00:26:30.905 --> 00:26:34.405
And he will give you into our hand like,

507
00:26:34.445 --> 00:26:35.925
I don't know about you, but that makes me wanna one

508
00:26:35.925 --> 00:26:37.845
through a wall or something like that's just,

509
00:26:39.315 --> 00:26:41.085
just gets going right there, man.

510
00:26:41.085 --> 00:26:45.385
Like that is so good. Good. But did you see it?

511
00:26:47.695 --> 00:26:49.065
What was David's ultimate goal?

512
00:26:51.715 --> 00:26:54.735
It wasn't just to defeat Goliath, to defeat the Philistines

513
00:26:54.735 --> 00:26:57.135
as necessary as that was, they defied God.

514
00:26:57.315 --> 00:27:01.895
Yes. His purpose was that all the earth

515
00:27:02.435 --> 00:27:04.615
may know that there is a God in Israel.

516
00:27:05.825 --> 00:27:10.785
That's what he wanted. Like that's just the same thing

517
00:27:10.935 --> 00:27:13.785
that God had told Abraham back in Genesis 12.

518
00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:15.905
He said, all the families

519
00:27:15.925 --> 00:27:17.865
of the earth shall be blessed through you.

520
00:27:19.745 --> 00:27:24.435
It's in fact what Psalm 96 records says,

521
00:27:24.615 --> 00:27:27.875
we are to declare his glory among the nations.

522
00:27:28.495 --> 00:27:30.915
His marvelous works among all the peoples.

523
00:27:31.495 --> 00:27:34.955
For great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

524
00:27:35.215 --> 00:27:39.755
He is to be feared above all gods, for all the gods

525
00:27:39.755 --> 00:27:41.955
of the peoples are worthless idols.

526
00:27:42.615 --> 00:27:45.315
But the Lord made the heavens

527
00:27:48.645 --> 00:27:49.985
see the comparison again, right?

528
00:27:54.445 --> 00:27:59.005
See, in God's economy there's always an evangelistic

529
00:28:00.675 --> 00:28:04.765
Drive That God is not just content.

530
00:28:05.305 --> 00:28:06.685
To have a few people

531
00:28:07.465 --> 00:28:10.725
in a little country in the Middle East know who he is

532
00:28:10.785 --> 00:28:11.925
and know him well.

533
00:28:13.255 --> 00:28:16.275
His heart purpose from the very beginning

534
00:28:16.705 --> 00:28:19.235
that David's heart was for, it's something

535
00:28:19.235 --> 00:28:20.355
that we need to understand.

536
00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:24.075
He heart is that his glory is declared

537
00:28:24.455 --> 00:28:25.995
to the ends of the earth.

538
00:28:27.065 --> 00:28:28.075
He's worthy of it.

539
00:28:29.805 --> 00:28:32.785
He is the God above all other gods, but also

540
00:28:32.785 --> 00:28:36.225
because anything else people live for is going

541
00:28:36.285 --> 00:28:37.985
to be unsatisfying.

542
00:28:38.055 --> 00:28:43.045
It's worthless any other God people

543
00:28:43.045 --> 00:28:46.525
choose to walk forward to, whether it's a figurine

544
00:28:46.585 --> 00:28:50.085
or whether it's an idol of materialism

545
00:28:50.425 --> 00:28:53.205
or whatever else we live for whatever else we put

546
00:28:53.225 --> 00:28:55.885
as supreme in our lives, relationships, kids,

547
00:28:56.525 --> 00:28:59.365
whatever it is, we put that in front, it's always going

548
00:28:59.365 --> 00:29:01.205
to be less than.

549
00:29:02.925 --> 00:29:03.955
It'll never satisfy.

550
00:29:04.705 --> 00:29:08.035
Nothing less than a relationship with Yahweh will satisfy

551
00:29:08.255 --> 00:29:09.255
Us.

552
00:29:10.535 --> 00:29:12.475
That's why his glory needs to be declared

553
00:29:13.635 --> 00:29:15.435
'cause there's nothing else to live for that's going

554
00:29:15.435 --> 00:29:17.515
to actually fill what we're looking for

555
00:29:19.195 --> 00:29:20.655
and he's worthy of it.

556
00:29:21.445 --> 00:29:25.375
That was David's heart. That's why God rejected Saul.

557
00:29:25.375 --> 00:29:26.655
That's why he chose David. It's

558
00:29:26.695 --> 00:29:29.015
'cause David's heart was right towards the glory

559
00:29:29.015 --> 00:29:30.495
of God shining to the ends of the earth.

560
00:29:32.055 --> 00:29:36.045
David wasn't being arrogant or prideful in any of this.

561
00:29:36.945 --> 00:29:40.925
He was just humbly confident in his supreme God that

562
00:29:40.995 --> 00:29:44.285
that nothing can prevent God's glory from shining

563
00:29:44.605 --> 00:29:45.845
brightly to the world.

564
00:29:46.665 --> 00:29:48.295
David just said, I wanna be a part of that.

565
00:29:51.005 --> 00:29:53.335
There's nothing else to live for. I wanna be a part of that.

566
00:29:53.385 --> 00:29:56.975
Which finally gets us to the actual battle like we've been

567
00:29:57.195 --> 00:30:00.575
for 47 verses just leading up to

568
00:30:02.115 --> 00:30:03.975
the actual battle itself.

569
00:30:05.175 --> 00:30:06.595
And it really only takes two verses

570
00:30:07.685 --> 00:30:10.135
because again, the narrator was focused not

571
00:30:10.135 --> 00:30:11.295
on military strategy.

572
00:30:11.395 --> 00:30:14.175
He was focused on theological interpretation of this,

573
00:30:15.485 --> 00:30:17.625
the difference between the God who cannot save

574
00:30:17.685 --> 00:30:19.585
and the God who does save.

575
00:30:20.815 --> 00:30:22.105
Look at verses 48

576
00:30:22.365 --> 00:30:26.985
and 49 when the Philistine arose and came

577
00:30:27.005 --> 00:30:28.585
and drew near to meet David.

578
00:30:29.435 --> 00:30:32.345
David ran quickly toward the battle line

579
00:30:32.685 --> 00:30:33.945
to meet the Philistine

580
00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:36.545
and David put his hand in his bag, took out a stone

581
00:30:36.765 --> 00:30:40.585
and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead.

582
00:30:41.285 --> 00:30:42.985
The stone sank into his forehead

583
00:30:43.165 --> 00:30:45.585
and he fell on his face to the ground.

584
00:30:48.115 --> 00:30:51.125
This is the victory that God gave to David.

585
00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:58.045
This is the victory, only one of the five stones.

586
00:30:58.145 --> 00:30:59.485
We don't know why he picked five,

587
00:30:59.505 --> 00:31:01.565
but one stone is all it took

588
00:31:02.855 --> 00:31:07.485
slung perfectly into the only vulnerable spot on Goliath's

589
00:31:07.485 --> 00:31:09.685
armor right between his eyes.

590
00:31:13.285 --> 00:31:15.785
Here's the thing though, most likely I didn't kill him.

591
00:31:19.925 --> 00:31:21.115
Definitely stunned him

592
00:31:21.115 --> 00:31:24.515
because look at this, this mortal Kombat like Finish him

593
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:27.315
scene in verses 50 through 54.

594
00:31:27.325 --> 00:31:31.195
Watch this. So David prevailed over the Philistine

595
00:31:31.625 --> 00:31:33.195
with a sling and a stone

596
00:31:33.255 --> 00:31:35.395
and struck the Philistine and killed him.

597
00:31:35.395 --> 00:31:36.915
There was no sword in the hand of David,

598
00:31:36.935 --> 00:31:38.115
but look at what 51 says.

599
00:31:38.115 --> 00:31:40.955
Then David ran and stood over the Philistine

600
00:31:41.215 --> 00:31:44.155
and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath

601
00:31:44.375 --> 00:31:46.515
and killed him and cut off his head with it.

602
00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:50.395
When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead,

603
00:31:50.395 --> 00:31:54.575
they fled and the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout

604
00:31:54.595 --> 00:31:56.775
and pursued the Philistines as far as Ga

605
00:31:56.795 --> 00:31:58.335
and the gates of Ekron.

606
00:31:58.395 --> 00:32:01.655
So the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Sha Reem

607
00:32:02.035 --> 00:32:04.615
as far as Gath and Akron, that's all that area

608
00:32:04.675 --> 00:32:06.055
to the west that we saw on the map.

609
00:32:06.235 --> 00:32:08.215
And the people of Israel came back from

610
00:32:08.215 --> 00:32:09.295
chasing the Philistines.

611
00:32:09.295 --> 00:32:10.415
They plundered their camp

612
00:32:10.715 --> 00:32:12.535
and David took the head of the Philistine

613
00:32:12.535 --> 00:32:13.895
and brought it to Jerusalem.

614
00:32:14.235 --> 00:32:16.335
But he put his armor in his tent.

615
00:32:17.575 --> 00:32:21.705
This was the victory that God gave to David, which is

616
00:32:21.705 --> 00:32:23.225
what David said was gonna happen.

617
00:32:23.705 --> 00:32:26.065
Remember in his speech to the Philistine, to the Goliath,

618
00:32:26.065 --> 00:32:27.585
he said, I'm gonna cut your head off.

619
00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:32.125
What'd he do? He won the

620
00:32:32.125 --> 00:32:36.135
battle this day.

621
00:32:36.135 --> 00:32:41.085
The Lord brought victory. Now there's

622
00:32:41.205 --> 00:32:42.965
actually one more scene here in chapter 17,

623
00:32:43.025 --> 00:32:44.645
and I believe this is to be a setup

624
00:32:44.905 --> 00:32:46.125
for the rest of the book.

625
00:32:46.605 --> 00:32:50.805
Actually Look at verses 55 through 58 quickly with me

626
00:32:50.805 --> 00:32:52.205
and we'll come back to the story.

627
00:32:52.665 --> 00:32:54.725
But this is the contrast again between Saul and David.

628
00:32:54.725 --> 00:32:55.925
Watch this. As soon

629
00:32:55.925 --> 00:32:59.205
as Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said

630
00:32:59.205 --> 00:33:01.125
to Abner, the commander of his army,

631
00:33:01.495 --> 00:33:02.765
Abner, whose son is this youth?

632
00:33:02.785 --> 00:33:04.885
And Abner said, well, as your soul is, I don't know.

633
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:08.645
And the king said, inquire who the son, the boy is.

634
00:33:08.705 --> 00:33:10.805
And as soon as David returned from striking down the

635
00:33:10.805 --> 00:33:12.485
Philistine, Abner took him, brought him

636
00:33:12.485 --> 00:33:14.605
before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.

637
00:33:15.705 --> 00:33:18.445
And Saul said to him, whose son are you? Young man?

638
00:33:18.445 --> 00:33:21.005
And David answered, I'm the son of your servant,

639
00:33:21.015 --> 00:33:22.365
Jesse, the Bethlehemite.

640
00:33:24.005 --> 00:33:25.905
Now if you remember a couple weeks ago I said

641
00:33:25.905 --> 00:33:28.785
that I believe I I, I wouldn't die on this hill

642
00:33:28.785 --> 00:33:31.145
but I I think the narrator flipped 17

643
00:33:31.145 --> 00:33:33.665
and 16 chronologically that David

644
00:33:33.685 --> 00:33:35.185
and Goliath was actually the first thing

645
00:33:35.345 --> 00:33:37.305
that happened chronologically in the story.

646
00:33:37.805 --> 00:33:42.225
But then 16 happened afterwards. But why did he do that?

647
00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:44.895
'cause Saul doesn't seem to even know

648
00:33:44.895 --> 00:33:46.335
who the guy is like this Dave, but

649
00:33:46.355 --> 00:33:48.175
but in 16 it says he's serving Saul.

650
00:33:48.195 --> 00:33:49.615
So how does this work out?

651
00:33:49.715 --> 00:33:53.255
It seems like the narrator flipped it

652
00:33:53.255 --> 00:33:56.855
because what he wanted to separate was God's election

653
00:33:56.915 --> 00:33:59.775
of David in chapter 16 from his military

654
00:33:59.775 --> 00:34:00.975
skills in chapter 17.

655
00:34:02.505 --> 00:34:04.245
In other words, God did not pick David

656
00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:05.965
because he was a champion warrior.

657
00:34:06.185 --> 00:34:08.205
He picked David because David was a man

658
00:34:08.205 --> 00:34:10.565
after God's own heart and he wanted God's purpose

659
00:34:10.625 --> 00:34:11.805
in the world over everything else.

660
00:34:12.745 --> 00:34:16.105
And that's all gonna come up again

661
00:34:16.105 --> 00:34:17.985
and again as we go through the rest of the book, keep

662
00:34:17.985 --> 00:34:19.665
that in your mind as we go into it.

663
00:34:21.555 --> 00:34:23.535
Now, that's one

664
00:34:23.535 --> 00:34:25.415
of the most fun narratives in all of scripture, right?

665
00:34:26.005 --> 00:34:28.295
Like David Goliath, we love that story,

666
00:34:28.315 --> 00:34:30.895
but here's the typical question then we ask as a result

667
00:34:30.895 --> 00:34:34.045
of it, okay, what do we do with it?

668
00:34:35.385 --> 00:34:36.845
But what do we do with that?

669
00:34:38.695 --> 00:34:40.115
And and I've heard varying

670
00:34:40.115 --> 00:34:41.715
interpretations of what we do with this.

671
00:34:41.745 --> 00:34:45.675
I've heard teachers and songwriters speak about facing the

672
00:34:45.695 --> 00:34:47.275
giants in your life with courage

673
00:34:47.275 --> 00:34:49.835
because this little boy was able to defeat giant

674
00:34:49.905 --> 00:34:51.795
with a sling and a stone.

675
00:34:52.335 --> 00:34:53.755
And you can do that too, right?

676
00:34:53.755 --> 00:34:56.195
Where we're like Dave with the giant pickle.

677
00:34:56.835 --> 00:34:58.555
Remember that like little people can do

678
00:34:58.555 --> 00:34:59.635
big things too, right?

679
00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:00.715
That was the whole point of that.

680
00:35:03.975 --> 00:35:07.475
But then I've also heard other teachers swing wildly the

681
00:35:07.475 --> 00:35:11.035
other way and scream at people saying you are not David,

682
00:35:11.455 --> 00:35:14.035
and go after them as if they're wrong

683
00:35:14.035 --> 00:35:17.115
and say This is only about Jesus and sin and that's it.

684
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:21.455
Right? Okay, well in some way they're both wrong I think,

685
00:35:22.515 --> 00:35:23.655
but also kind of both, right?

686
00:35:25.495 --> 00:35:26.495
So what do we do with this?

687
00:35:27.835 --> 00:35:28.845
Because It's true

688
00:35:29.875 --> 00:35:32.885
that since Jesus interpreted the Old Testament

689
00:35:33.145 --> 00:35:34.645
as talking ultimately about him,

690
00:35:37.185 --> 00:35:39.845
the primary truth we do need to remember in this is

691
00:35:39.845 --> 00:35:42.845
that Jesus did defeat the biggest giant we face.

692
00:35:45.725 --> 00:35:46.775
Like we need to remember

693
00:35:46.775 --> 00:35:49.135
that Jesus defeated the biggest giant for us

694
00:35:53.185 --> 00:35:55.715
because Jesus is referred to as the son of David.

695
00:35:55.935 --> 00:35:59.835
So often we look at David as a type

696
00:36:00.095 --> 00:36:03.035
of Christ who's pointing us forward to the things

697
00:36:03.035 --> 00:36:05.555
that Jesus would do perfectly, which means that all

698
00:36:05.555 --> 00:36:09.195
of one Samuel 17 in that story, you are not David.

699
00:36:09.515 --> 00:36:10.995
I am not David in that story.

700
00:36:12.975 --> 00:36:14.275
You and I are Saul

701
00:36:14.375 --> 00:36:16.315
and the rest of Israel hiding in the bushes

702
00:36:16.315 --> 00:36:20.115
because we're terrified of that giant called sin

703
00:36:21.415 --> 00:36:22.515
and we can't defeat it.

704
00:36:24.775 --> 00:36:28.915
And so we needed a champion to come in

705
00:36:29.255 --> 00:36:31.555
and rescue us

706
00:36:32.215 --> 00:36:36.235
to win a representative battle for us so

707
00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:38.075
that we could be free.

708
00:36:38.455 --> 00:36:41.875
He would overcome that sin through his life, death

709
00:36:41.895 --> 00:36:44.275
and resurrection, that we could never defeat

710
00:36:44.275 --> 00:36:45.755
that enemy ourselves.

711
00:36:48.555 --> 00:36:50.295
That's ultimately what this is about.

712
00:36:50.475 --> 00:36:53.515
Yes, that you

713
00:36:53.515 --> 00:36:57.695
and I as sinners, hiding, scared,

714
00:36:58.655 --> 00:37:00.925
defeated you

715
00:37:00.925 --> 00:37:03.805
and I can receive the victory of Jesus

716
00:37:04.545 --> 00:37:07.925
as we believe in faith that he's won the battle for us.

717
00:37:09.525 --> 00:37:11.985
Yes, That is absolutely part of what this is about.

718
00:37:13.795 --> 00:37:15.695
And most importantly, that's what it's about.

719
00:37:15.755 --> 00:37:18.255
But it doesn't only point us forward

720
00:37:18.315 --> 00:37:19.695
to Jesus as our champion.

721
00:37:19.915 --> 00:37:21.575
See, listen, Romans 15,

722
00:37:21.575 --> 00:37:25.135
four talks about everything happening to Israel as written

723
00:37:25.355 --> 00:37:29.455
for our instruction both what to do and what not to do.

724
00:37:29.715 --> 00:37:31.815
It was part of why it was recorded.

725
00:37:31.925 --> 00:37:33.535
That means as we examine

726
00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:36.455
how everyone in this narrative responded

727
00:37:36.455 --> 00:37:40.935
to the giant problem they faced, that means we can learn

728
00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:45.295
that God fights through those who trust him.

729
00:37:47.025 --> 00:37:51.795
We can believe that. We can believe that God does fight

730
00:37:51.795 --> 00:37:53.995
through those who trust him.

731
00:37:55.695 --> 00:37:58.995
It doesn't mean we go fight like pick fights with the enemy

732
00:38:00.225 --> 00:38:03.285
and we go try to find Satan so that we can pick a fight.

733
00:38:03.505 --> 00:38:06.765
No, it just means we know how to stand firm.

734
00:38:07.075 --> 00:38:09.405
When our enemy tries to challenge God

735
00:38:09.585 --> 00:38:12.795
and tries to challenge his people, it means

736
00:38:12.795 --> 00:38:16.435
that we don't trust the world's means for victory.

737
00:38:17.055 --> 00:38:18.915
We trust God for victory.

738
00:38:20.525 --> 00:38:24.185
It means that we are willing to be used if God wants

739
00:38:24.185 --> 00:38:26.785
to use even us to do something like this.

740
00:38:28.925 --> 00:38:31.985
It means God works and fights through those who trust him.

741
00:38:32.045 --> 00:38:33.185
And listen in your life

742
00:38:33.185 --> 00:38:35.145
and my life, it might not look as drastic

743
00:38:35.505 --> 00:38:39.975
as cutting off the head of Goliath, But you can trust

744
00:38:42.185 --> 00:38:44.075
that when you believe in God

745
00:38:44.135 --> 00:38:46.235
and you believe in his power,

746
00:38:47.065 --> 00:38:49.835
that he is winning battles in your life.

747
00:38:52.565 --> 00:38:54.785
You can trust him, you can obey him,

748
00:38:54.785 --> 00:38:58.745
and you can believe that he's going to do what he wants

749
00:38:58.745 --> 00:39:00.425
to do and he's going to win battles.

750
00:39:00.495 --> 00:39:05.065
He's working to shine His glory even brighter through those

751
00:39:05.165 --> 00:39:08.465
who trust him, through those who obey him so

752
00:39:08.465 --> 00:39:11.265
that all the world may know who God is.

753
00:39:13.035 --> 00:39:14.615
You can trust it, you can believe it,

754
00:39:14.835 --> 00:39:16.695
you can follow him in it.

755
00:39:20.315 --> 00:39:22.415
But there's even deeper layer to all this as well.

756
00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:26.665
And I think it's really subtle here in chapter 17,

757
00:39:26.685 --> 00:39:28.905
but I think it's really important for us to understand

758
00:39:29.045 --> 00:39:31.145
to even get to that level of belief

759
00:39:31.145 --> 00:39:32.185
and trust in God,

760
00:39:36.155 --> 00:39:37.845
each of us need to stop

761
00:39:38.025 --> 00:39:41.955
and consider what story am I listening to?

762
00:39:46.765 --> 00:39:49.375
What story am I listening to? Ask yourself that here.

763
00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:53.585
Here's what I mean. You remember early in this narrative,

764
00:39:53.765 --> 00:39:57.545
all we heard were the claims of the Philistines sixteens.

765
00:40:00.065 --> 00:40:01.515
They were saying, Hey, this is a battle

766
00:40:01.515 --> 00:40:02.995
between your army and our army.

767
00:40:03.135 --> 00:40:05.035
And look at how big our champion is.

768
00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:07.195
Look at how strong he is. Look at his military.

769
00:40:07.195 --> 00:40:10.675
Might look at how weak you guys are compared to who he is.

770
00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:12.195
Look at how powerful he is.

771
00:40:12.295 --> 00:40:14.275
And how did Saul and his army respond?

772
00:40:15.145 --> 00:40:18.255
They were dismayed, greatly afraid.

773
00:40:21.445 --> 00:40:22.615
They were, listen, hear this.

774
00:40:22.965 --> 00:40:25.735
They were listening to the story of the world.

775
00:40:27.095 --> 00:40:30.185
They were listening to the story of the Philistines,

776
00:40:30.185 --> 00:40:33.785
the story of the enemy, the story of their own flesh.

777
00:40:35.805 --> 00:40:38.815
Instead of listening to the story

778
00:40:39.165 --> 00:40:43.835
that God had told them, instead

779
00:40:43.835 --> 00:40:46.915
of believing what God had already said,

780
00:40:47.235 --> 00:40:48.835
remember he said he would deliver them.

781
00:40:49.015 --> 00:40:50.915
Do you remember He said he was going

782
00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:52.155
to win battles for them.

783
00:40:52.375 --> 00:40:54.155
He said he was going to bless them.

784
00:40:54.305 --> 00:40:55.915
They forgot that and they listened to

785
00:40:55.915 --> 00:40:56.955
that story in front of them.

786
00:40:59.035 --> 00:41:02.095
Listen, it reminds me of numbers 13.

787
00:41:02.505 --> 00:41:06.015
Moses sent 12 spies into the promised land to scout it out,

788
00:41:06.015 --> 00:41:08.855
to check it out, see how great it is so that they can know

789
00:41:08.855 --> 00:41:10.615
how they're going to move forward.

790
00:41:10.965 --> 00:41:13.775
They all saw when those 12 went into the land,

791
00:41:13.775 --> 00:41:15.095
they all saw the same thing.

792
00:41:16.165 --> 00:41:18.855
They saw giants, they saw fortified cities.

793
00:41:19.045 --> 00:41:20.495
They saw everything in front of them

794
00:41:20.725 --> 00:41:24.415
that they then had a choice whether they were going

795
00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:27.415
to believe what they saw that was scary

796
00:41:27.795 --> 00:41:31.775
or they were going to believe what God had said and done.

797
00:41:33.795 --> 00:41:35.735
You remember, God had promised the land.

798
00:41:37.125 --> 00:41:39.175
They had no doubt if they really believed

799
00:41:39.175 --> 00:41:41.535
that God had promised it all was in front of them.

800
00:41:41.805 --> 00:41:45.455
They also had seen God deliver them from Egypt,

801
00:41:46.505 --> 00:41:49.895
split the sea wide open defeat enemies left

802
00:41:49.955 --> 00:41:52.135
and right the whole time.

803
00:41:56.535 --> 00:42:00.145
They had every reason to trust they could know

804
00:42:00.415 --> 00:42:04.105
that God was going to deliver them and only two of them did.

805
00:42:06.945 --> 00:42:09.405
Two of the 12 believed God.

806
00:42:10.865 --> 00:42:12.845
Is that not the same thing that's happening here in Isaiah?

807
00:42:12.985 --> 00:42:17.185
In in one Samuel 17, Saul

808
00:42:17.485 --> 00:42:21.265
and Israel, they allowed the Philistine story

809
00:42:21.565 --> 00:42:24.065
to shape their views of what was happening.

810
00:42:24.215 --> 00:42:26.705
That it was about strength and power.

811
00:42:26.805 --> 00:42:30.225
And military might instead of remembering who God is.

812
00:42:33.145 --> 00:42:37.715
But David saw the same giant, heard the same

813
00:42:38.285 --> 00:42:40.235
story, but instead of hiding

814
00:42:40.575 --> 00:42:42.875
or bribing other people to try to take over,

815
00:42:43.415 --> 00:42:45.995
he believed in God's glory more than anything else.

816
00:42:47.975 --> 00:42:50.955
Listen, is that not a daily struggle for us as well?

817
00:42:53.095 --> 00:42:55.155
Is that not the same thing we face?

818
00:42:55.455 --> 00:42:59.395
How are we listening to the wrong stories?

819
00:43:01.865 --> 00:43:04.525
How are we listening to falsehoods?

820
00:43:04.865 --> 00:43:07.325
How are we not listening to truth?

821
00:43:08.565 --> 00:43:10.685
'cause there are competing narratives all

822
00:43:10.685 --> 00:43:12.285
around us every single day.

823
00:43:14.185 --> 00:43:15.405
And you know what I'm talking about?

824
00:43:15.405 --> 00:43:18.245
Things like, well, this is how you win at life.

825
00:43:19.235 --> 00:43:23.745
This will satisfy you. You need to do this to be fulfilled.

826
00:43:23.925 --> 00:43:26.185
You need to do this so you can win.

827
00:43:26.445 --> 00:43:29.225
And all of those things, or even the narratives

828
00:43:29.255 --> 00:43:32.985
that you hear that man you, you can never overcome, that

829
00:43:34.385 --> 00:43:39.255
you're weak, God doesn't care about you,

830
00:43:41.825 --> 00:43:44.245
or whatever other story you

831
00:43:44.385 --> 00:43:49.245
or your flesh gets tossed, that enemy throws it in your mind

832
00:43:49.305 --> 00:43:50.365
and you think about that.

833
00:43:50.425 --> 00:43:54.245
Listen, how are you choosing instead to listen to the story

834
00:43:54.245 --> 00:43:58.965
of God like two, the reality

835
00:43:59.465 --> 00:44:03.965
of this God who has no competitors to his throne, the God

836
00:44:03.985 --> 00:44:06.205
who cannot be defeated, the God

837
00:44:06.205 --> 00:44:08.205
who has already overcome the world,

838
00:44:08.385 --> 00:44:12.165
the God whose glory will shine to the ends of the earth.

839
00:44:12.555 --> 00:44:16.445
This same God who fills you with his power, the same God

840
00:44:16.445 --> 00:44:19.405
who has a good plan for your life when you trust him

841
00:44:19.405 --> 00:44:21.245
and obey him, this God who works

842
00:44:21.245 --> 00:44:23.205
through those who trust him.

843
00:44:23.435 --> 00:44:26.565
This God who's not afraid of a puny little giant,

844
00:44:27.035 --> 00:44:30.045
that is the true story we need to listen to over

845
00:44:30.185 --> 00:44:31.525
and over and over again.

846
00:44:33.305 --> 00:44:36.325
Listen, that's why we soak in His word

847
00:44:39.815 --> 00:44:42.235
so that we can listen to his story

848
00:44:42.545 --> 00:44:44.075
that defines everything else

849
00:44:46.065 --> 00:44:49.285
and so we can trust him more no matter what we face.

850
00:44:53.025 --> 00:44:54.885
That's also why we do the Lord's Supper.

851
00:44:56.825 --> 00:44:58.525
Listen, we, we trust God's sovereign.

852
00:44:58.525 --> 00:45:01.525
We did not plan like this for this sermon,

853
00:45:02.305 --> 00:45:05.925
but it works to where

854
00:45:06.705 --> 00:45:09.445
the Lord's supper pictures a

855
00:45:09.535 --> 00:45:12.405
story of victory.

856
00:45:15.305 --> 00:45:18.125
It shows us that Jesus life, death,

857
00:45:18.545 --> 00:45:21.205
and resurrection is enough

858
00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:23.685
to bring the victory for you and for me.

859
00:45:26.145 --> 00:45:29.725
And man, we forget that. We doubt it.

860
00:45:30.645 --> 00:45:34.125
I was bad this week, probably gone too far.

861
00:45:34.725 --> 00:45:36.205
Whatever it is, right? We've done these things

862
00:45:36.225 --> 00:45:40.405
and we doubt this story is what we need to be listening to.
