1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.300
if

2
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.500
here

3
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.300
Good morning again church. If you have your copy of

4
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.300
God's word turn with me to Luke 14. Luke chapter

5
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.900
14 is where we will be studying today

6
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.100
versus 25 through 33. Let's go

7
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.200
ahead and find that as we get into it today.

8
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.200
We're continuing our series through Jesus's parables in the

9
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.400
Book of Luke where we are going to be confronted again

10
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.300
today with the reality of what it means to

11
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.900
be a kingdom citizen.

12
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.000
Where the values of God's kingdom are many ways

13
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
opposite to what the way of the world is.

14
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.400
Getting into it today though. I want to take you back about 16 months

15
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.500
ago.

16
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.100
To a time in my life that I believe has changed my

17
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.700
life forever.

18
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.500
See was a Wednesday night a long day of ministry

19
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.300
up here and I get home and and I feel this low grade

20
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.700
dizziness.

21
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.100
So I thought well, it's just like exhaustion. I'm gonna

22
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.600
go to bed and wake up tomorrow be all fine. But over

23
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.000
the next couple days, it just got steadily worse.

24
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.800
To where that Sunday? I couldn't be here. Brett had to fill in last minute to

25
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.300
preach.

26
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200
And that dizzy feeling would come and go over the

27
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.300
next couple weeks where at times it would be really really bad at

28
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.500
times. It would be almost disappearing but it all

29
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500
came to a head that first week of April.

30
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.200
Easter week

31
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.300
We're on that Wednesday. I was in the ER right across

32
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.900
the street here.

33
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.300
Because it was so bad. I couldn't function we thought maybe

34
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.200
I've got a tumor we're doing CT scans. We just don't know what it

35
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.100
is trying to figure it out.

36
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.400
I had to miss Good Friday that week up here

37
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.600
and

38
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.600
it's just a terrible few days, but I was not missing

39
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.400
Easter Sunday, right? That's like the Super Bowl for us.

40
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
And so I was here had someone pick

41
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.300
me up and drive me here that morning and I was so

42
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.200
unstable that I had to sit in a chair low chair

43
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.300
right here to preach.

44
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.200
My head was tilted about five degrees off because my

45
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.700
brain was off and and I got up and I stumbled off

46
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.300
like I was on a cruise ship walking off the stage after

47
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.800
I was done.

48
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.000
I think we're not totally sure what it was.

49
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.200
But we think it was a virus that landed in my inner ear and kind

50
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.900
of blew up your balance system and that finally tuned system that it is.

51
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.100
But let me just give you a glimpse of how terrible it was for

52
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.000
those stretches of time during those weeks.

53
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.200
Last year, so I'm laying there in

54
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.700
the room feels like it's spinning around me.

55
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.500
My eyes were tracking movement that wasn't

56
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.800
there.

57
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.200
Because I couldn't stop it.

58
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.800
Thankfully those stretches of time after

59
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.400
Easter Sunday just began to slowly fade away

60
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.300
where I started in a chair and then you know

61
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.100
next week. I was in a stool and then over the course of

62
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.400
that summary. It was like a stool and I was standing some and then sitting some

63
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.500
and it was fun to watch the dynamic some kids. Hey, you're

64
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.100
standing more today like that kind of thing as up here.

65
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.800
To where now? I feel

66
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.700
completely normal in that

67
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.200
so praise the Lord for that but here's why I share

68
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.400
all that see many of you walked with us through that. So I

69
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.300
want to say thank you again for helping serve our family

70
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.400
through that many of you are new no nothing about that at

71
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.100
all. And so this is all news but here's why I share that.

72
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.700
Seeing those stretches where I'm laying flat on my back.

73
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.900
Couldn't move without feeling I was gonna lose my lunch right?

74
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.800
I couldn't do anything.

75
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.700
I got to a pretty dark place.

76
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.700
I mean I couldn't sleep.

77
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.400
I couldn't watch TV I couldn't read.

78
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.600
I couldn't play with my sons. I couldn't do

79
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.000
anything.

80
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.600
I couldn't distract myself from the chaos that

81
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.500
was going on in my body and in my life at

82
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.700
the time.

83
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.300
So I'm just laying there in my thoughts in my

84
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.400
fears. Haven't slept for days. Wondering am

85
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.400
I ever gonna work again?

86
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.500
Like will I ever be able to drive a car again or was spinning

87
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.400
coming on will I ever be useful at home?

88
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.900
Watching my sons.

89
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.300
Uncertain about the future because they've never seen me really suffer like

90
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.300
that. I can't do anything and my wife carrying such an incredibly

91
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.600
heavy burden for that stretch of time where I couldn't help.

92
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.800
Like it was the most emotionally draining time

93
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.300
of my life.

94
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.400
Shed many tears.

95
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.700
wrestling internally with that

96
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.000
but here's what Jesus did through that.

97
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.600
in me

98
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.500
you remember seeing those like crime detective

99
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.800
TV shows or movies where?

100
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.400
Where they're bringing the perpetrator in for questioning?

101
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.300
And they bring him in this little room and there's one little table with one little

102
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.800
light bulb sitting right up hanging up above it and there's the

103
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.300
chair for the detective and then there's the chair

104
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.400
for the perpetrator the detectives asking questions and it's just

105
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.200
that scene right you get that scene in your head.

106
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.200
That's what Jesus did with me.

107
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.100
As I imagine him I can almost visualize what

108
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.000
I felt in that moment where I'm I'm sitting there.

109
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.400
He sits me down across the table everything else

110
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.900
in my life is Stripped Away. I have no distractions.

111
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.300
I can't distract my mind. I can't

112
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.700
do anything and Jesus almost audibly

113
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.300
asked me the question in that setting.

114
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.100
Am I enough for you?

115
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.400
If you get none of that back.

116
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.500
If you can never preach again.

117
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.100
If you can't work.

118
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.300
If you have to be driven everywhere, if you have to take medicine your whole

119
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.800
life. If you can't work out like you did before you can't play with your sons.

120
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.100
If you can't do any of that I if none of

121
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.400
that ever comes back, Jesus asks me.

122
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.900
Am I enough for you?

123
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.100
Is Jesus enough?

124
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.300
transparently

125
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.000
I'd never really had to answer that question before.

126
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.100
I've always had enough.

127
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.400
Like I've never been to the end of myself like that where

128
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400
I had nothing else.

129
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.400
Well, it's fully dependent on him and even on others

130
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.800
in that moment, where where I was unable to

131
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.000
do anything.

132
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.200
There's a piercing question.

133
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.800
But I want you to hear me today.

134
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.200
Jesus is asking every single one of

135
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.100
us that same question.

136
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.700
Is he enough for you?

137
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600
Is Jesus enough?

138
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.900
Or is it? Yes, Jesus as

139
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.400
long as I have this to.

140
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.100
As long as I have enough money as long as I don't

141
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.400
suffer too bad as long as

142
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.100
I have some Comforts to or is

143
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.400
Jesus.

144
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.000
enough

145
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.900
It's the question. He asked me.

146
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.800
Continually asks me that's the question. He asks here

147
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.200
in Luke 14.

148
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.800
Starting in verse 25 look at what he says to the crowds here.

149
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.400
Now great crowds accompanied Jesus and he turned and

150
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.300
said to them if anyone comes to me and does

151
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.500
not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and

152
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.300
brothers and sisters. Yes and even his own life.

153
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.600
He cannot be my disciple.

154
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.300
Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me

155
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.700
cannot be my disciple.

156
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.600
For which of you Desiring to build a tower

157
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.000
does not first sit down and count the cost.

158
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.100
Whether he has enough to complete it.

159
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.100
Otherwise when he has laid a foundation is not able to

160
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.500
finish all who see it begin to mock him.

161
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.500
Saying this man began to build and was not able to finish.

162
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.500
Or what king going out to encounter? Another king in

163
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.300
war will not sit down first and deliberate whether

164
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.400
he is able with 10,000 to meet him who comes against him

165
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400
with 20,000.

166
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.200
And if not while the others he had a great way off. He sends

167
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.500
a delegation asked for terms of peace.

168
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.400
So therefore any one of you who does not renounce all that.

169
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.800
He has cannot be my disciple Jesus.

170
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.000
We need you today.

171
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.800
These are hard words.

172
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.400
open our ears to hear open our eyes to see

173
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.300
open our hearts to receive your

174
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.600
word for us today

175
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.400
Don't let us temper this run away from this God. May

176
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.100
we face this?

177
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:41.900
full on

178
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.200
with what you want to teach us and change in

179
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.900
us today For Your Glory.

180
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.000
And Jesus name we pray amen.

181
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.400
So, let me give you a memorable way to to

182
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.400
think about what Jesus is teaching here

183
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.300
in this passage.

184
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.700
The idea that you can walk away with that you see

185
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.500
him teaching here is that Jesus wants followers not

186
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:08.900
fans.

187
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.200
There's a well-known book that talks about this. But but that's the

188
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.800
idea here. Jesus wants followers not fans. Now.

189
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.900
You understand the difference, right?

190
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.400
a fan

191
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.100
is someone who likes maybe even loves the

192
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.400
team?

193
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.500
But it's not a hundred percent invested.

194
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.100
Right, they are up in the stands. They stay up in

195
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.400
the stands. In fact, many many fans will even turn

196
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.800
on you.

197
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.400
Be critical when it doesn't go their way.

198
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.500
I know this first hand in 2001 homecoming against, Colorado.

199
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.400
Everybody loved the trick play that I completed the

200
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.900
long pass and there's a play of the game and all of that.

201
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.800
But then at the end of the game when I dropped a pass on the game-winning Drive.

202
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.500
They were yelling at me like I was worthless.

203
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.900
See a fan.

204
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.300
Not only gets critical but a fan

205
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.100
leaves early when the game's not in hand and

206
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.900
they don't they don't see the end result. They don't like the results

207
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.800
and so they leave.

208
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.300
bail

209
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.400
A follower though is like a player actually on the team committed to

210
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.600
the team involved in the team sinks with

211
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.900
the team win losing full on and Rises with

212
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.700
the team win winning full on.

213
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.700
Because they are a hundred percent committed to

214
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.000
it.

215
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.600
And here with this Parable and all of The Parables

216
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.500
Jesus is separating those two groups. He

217
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.300
separating fans from followers. What he's doing is he's getting

218
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.000
people to think about the reason they're following him.

219
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.300
But also think about the cost involved to follow him.

220
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.600
And so what we consider today as we also inherent

221
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.000
In this passage is this same call to

222
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.400
us today to follow him. Like he

223
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.200
was implying for those who are following him in that moment.

224
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.500
So as we hear the call to follow Jesus we are

225
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.800
reminded of his invitation.

226
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.800
This invitation to follow him is all

227
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.000
over the gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John, in fact

228
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.800
22 times. At least the words follow me

229
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.000
come out of Jesus's mouth in those Gospels.

230
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.000
Where he's either talking to a person he's talking to

231
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.500
a group or just in general. He's talking to his disciples that this

232
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.700
was what people should do is saying follow me.

233
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.400
Follow me was his invitation that's really

234
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.000
to Jesus the essence of of lordship

235
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.100
and salvation to him that that we are

236
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.600
saved not to a theological principle. We're saved

237
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:00.900
to a person.

238
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.100
Not just mental beliefs. We're saved to

239
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.900
Jesus. In fact, that's the word disciple what it means is follower.

240
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.100
So these Disciples of Jesus they were merely followers which

241
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.300
means to follow someone around

242
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.200
a disciple followed someone here. Jesus could

243
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.000
be a number of different rabbis a follower

244
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.300
of that person was also learning how

245
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.200
to imitate that person to do what they did

246
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.500
to say what they say think like they thought so a disciple

247
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.100
is a follower

248
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.200
An imitator so we talk about disciple making around here

249
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.700
a lot.

250
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.400
What we mean by that is we are helping someone learn

251
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.600
how to imitate Jesus. It's simple that's

252
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.700
all we're talking about. It's not some theological teaching

253
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.100
and all the depth of that that's part of it, but it's not

254
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.000
just that it's also saying here's how you love someone.

255
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.400
Let me show you that's how Jesus did it. So let's how

256
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.400
this is how we should do it as well. So there's

257
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.300
this call that we see to us even today

258
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.600
to follow Jesus, but as we've seen here some stipulations.

259
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.600
To following Jesus right there. There's a cost involved

260
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.900
here. We must count that cost to follow

261
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.200
Jesus.

262
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.900
As we hear the call, let's not forget the cost. Imagine again.

263
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.300
Jesus sitting across that table

264
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:26.800
from you.

265
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.100
from me

266
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.500
and he says these words here in Luke

267
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.800
14 and he says that to you and

268
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.300
you're thinking the same thing that I'm thinking as I'm

269
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.400
reading this here, like now wait a second Jesus hold up.

270
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.400
What you're telling me here is that I have to hate

271
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.000
my family.

272
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.300
You're telling me that I have to die on a

273
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.700
cross to follow you.

274
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.400
That I got to sell everything. I have to go live under a bridge. Is that

275
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.700
is that what you're saying Jesus that I have to do that to

276
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.500
follow you?

277
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.200
And it sounds radical. That's why we temper this

278
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.300
right we kind of say let's not really what he meant. It's not the only time he

279
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:09.700
said this.

280
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.600
In fact in Luke chapter 9 where he

281
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.200
had just told them he's going to die on

282
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.100
a cross. He said this if anyone would come after me

283
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.300
let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow

284
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:23.400
me.

285
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.700
For whoever would save his life will lose it. But whoever loses

286
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.500
his life for my sake will save it.

287
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.500
For what? Does it profit of man if he gains the whole world and loses or

288
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.400
forfeits himself?

289
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.400
And listen, he was serious about that because of what he says next in

290
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.600
verse 26. He says whoever is ashamed of me and

291
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.500
of my words of him will

292
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.400
the son of man be ashamed when he comes in his glory.

293
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.400
What he means is that what I just said, you better take it seriously.

294
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.800
Pick up your cross die. I mean what I say

295
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.700
that there's a cost to follow Jesus.

296
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.500
see True Discipleship requires total

297
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.000
dedication

298
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.400
But even as we say this, there's one at least one way we

299
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.500
can get confused on this.

300
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.300
Again, we hear these words.

301
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.600
Jesus do you literally mean we have to hate our families

302
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.500
and our stuff?

303
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.100
It's Jesus. Do you do you mean I hate my wife?

304
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.100
Here's where understanding Jewish culture is helpful.

305
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.300
because when they would use the word hate

306
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.600
they didn't use it. Like we think of bitterness and anger

307
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.400
and all that involved in hatred. They didn't use it that

308
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:52.500
way.

309
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.600
They used it in a way that it was just that you loved something

310
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.300
else so much more.

311
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.600
That you loved this comparatively so much

312
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.200
that it seems like you hate the

313
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.600
rest of it.

314
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.600
In fact, Jesus says it this way in Matthew 10, whoever loves father

315
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.400
or mother more than me is not worthy

316
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.500
of me. It's what he says here Luke 14 just in

317
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.200
a little different way. Whoever loves son or daughter more than me is

318
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.700
not worthy of me. That's what he's saying is you

319
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.300
love me so much that it

320
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.400
seems like you hate.

321
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:27.900
your family

322
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.700
Means what Jesus was saying in Luke 14, was that him being in

323
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.200
first place in your life. Totally overwhelms

324
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.100
the natural love you have for your family

325
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:41.600
members.

326
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.300
I served on staff with a man in Stillwater at a

327
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.300
church and and as he left that church he moved

328
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.400
him and his family to Southeast Asia.

329
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.600
To be missionaries to an unreached people group there.

330
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.400
They had multiple kids when they left they had multiple kids

331
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.400
over there. They now have nine. And so that was quite

332
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.100
the sight walking around Southeast Asia.

333
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.400
But I remember him telling me something after he had announced that they

334
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.600
were called to move over there and he had someone come

335
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.000
up to him.

336
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.800
And ask him this question to his face.

337
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.800
Do you hate your kids?

338
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.200
And we got a chuckle about that a little bit. But but what they meant by

339
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:29.600
that question.

340
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.500
Was that he was taking them out of the Safety and Security of

341
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.000
America?

342
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.500
And he was taking them and depriving them from the convenience

343
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.800
and Comforts that we have here.

344
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.500
He was moving them away from family and from Friends.

345
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.200
And on and on we could go do you hate your kids?

346
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.900
And what he told me in that conversation.

347
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.200
Was that when we obey Jesus as we

348
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:58.500
should?

349
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.600
It will probably look like to the world that

350
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.700
we really do hate our family.

351
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.600
It will appear like we are depriving or

352
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.000
hurting them. We hate them in reality. It's just that we

353
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.600
love Jesus so much more than all of this.

354
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.500
And the way that we best love our family is by

355
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.900
following him wholeheartedly.

356
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.400
That's actually the right way to love your family

357
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.600
is to put him first.

358
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.000
And if he calls he calls and you go and they

359
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.100
see that.

360
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.100
That Jesus is king of your life.

361
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.200
It's the absolute best way.

362
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.800
Even to the point where Jesus says here. We must be willing if

363
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.500
he calls to give up our very

364
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:47.900
lives.

365
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.800
Now he might not ask that of you.

366
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.900
But I think it's healthy at times to consider.

367
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.800
If he does ask that of you.

368
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.400
Are you willing?

369
00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.700
If he puts you in a situation where you have to

370
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.500
give your life for him, are you

371
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:14.500
willing?

372
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.000
Because remember the cross he asked us to pick up.

373
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.200
is an instrument of death

374
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.400
so he says do that.

375
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.300
Would you be willing because when he was saying that to his hearers they

376
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.800
fully understood what he meant.

377
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.200
Because maybe earlier that day or maybe the

378
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.600
week before or the month before they had heard Roman

379
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.300
soldiers. Look at someone and say take up your

380
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.100
cross and follow me.

381
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.400
So they knew when Jesus said take up your cross and

382
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.200
follow me. They understood that meant effectively.

383
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.800
I must consider myself already dead.

384
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.000
It's the best illustration of self-denial.

385
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.400
It's not my life.

386
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.300
I've died Galatians 2:20 crucified with Christ. I no

387
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.400
longer live Christ lives in me. I have given it up.

388
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.500
for him

389
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.600
I've already chosen to die to myself. Jesus

390
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.800
says it like this in John 12. He says whoever loves his

391
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.300
life clings to his life loses it.

392
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.200
Whoever hates his life in this world meaning loves

393
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.600
Jesus more than this

394
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.000
life. Whoever hates his life in this world will keep it.

395
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.900
for eternal life

396
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.000
See, that's what I wrestled with last year.

397
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.200
That if I'm going to follow Jesus wholeheartedly like

398
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.300
he calls me to then I must not

399
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.700
Place ultimate value on anything else

400
00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.900
that him.

401
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.000
Everything else is secondary.

402
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.400
To living for him to obey him to

403
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.500
worshiping him it all comes second. Even

404
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.500
the good things in life even even my own physical life.

405
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.200
It all comes secondary to his Pursuit.

406
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.200
And then Jesus told these two Parables that that don't lower the

407
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.400
bar in any way, right?

408
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.100
Remember what they said?

409
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:29.800
and Luke 14

410
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.300
Which of you Desiring to build a tower does not first

411
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.500
sit down and count the cost.

412
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.900
Whether he has enough to complete it.

413
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.600
Otherwise when he's laid a foundation is not able to finish all who

414
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.200
see it begin to mock him saying this man began to

415
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.500
build is not able to finish like look at how nice this Foundation looks that's

416
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:50.700
it.

417
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.200
Or what king going out to encounter? Another king

418
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.600
in war will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with

419
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.600
10,000 to meet whom who comes against him with twenty

420
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.200
thousand and if not while the other is yet a great way

421
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.200
off. He sends a delegation asked for terms of Peace. He's not able to meet

422
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.300
that. So he says man, I got to protect myself and limit my damage

423
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.800
here, so I'm going

424
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:18.800
So you look at this.

425
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.700
and you think

426
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.500
What's the dominant word that Jesus uses over and

427
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.100
over and over in that Passage?

428
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.600
It's the word Abel.

429
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.400
You see it here verse 29 is he able to

430
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:34.700
finish?

431
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.800
Verse 30 is he able to finish verse 31

432
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.000
is he able with 10,000 to go

433
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.500
against 20,000 verse 32. It's implied. He's not able to go

434
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.400
against that big army. And so he asked for peace

435
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.600
even verse 28 does he have enough to complete

436
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.700
it? That's talking ability, right?

437
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.600
That word able in fact is related to the original Greek

438
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.200
word. Dunamis many of you know that word

439
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.300
already where it's it's the word for power.

440
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.200
It's where we get our English word Dynamite happens to

441
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.300
be on July 4th weekend. I didn't plan that but but you see like the point

442
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.300
is the power able to

443
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.400
do it. In fact the word that's negative of that is

444
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.300
the same word cannot be in those same

445
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:19.800
verses.

446
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.200
When Jesus said in verse 27, you cannot be my disciple. It's the same

447
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:24.900
word.

448
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.400
Able to do this able to do this cannot be

449
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.300
so you look at verse 27 a little differently.

450
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.300
Whoever does not bear his own cross and come

451
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.600
after me is not able to be my disciple.

452
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.500
does not have the power the capacity the capability

453
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:43.900
to be

454
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.400
and that's the fundamental question. Jesus asking the

455
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:50.800
crowd.

456
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:52.900
asking us

457
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.300
Are you able to follow me?

458
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.300
The word Abel over and over that's the power that

459
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.500
dunamis power like the capacity. Are you

460
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:04.500
able

461
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.700
to follow Jesus

462
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.600
Do you have the power to follow Jesus?

463
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.000
now theologically

464
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:17.800
we understand.

465
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.600
none of us are

466
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.200
there's not one of us who has the

467
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.600
ability in our dead sinful selves to

468
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.400
follow him. We cannot do it. Our

469
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.700
hearts must be awakened by faith to his

470
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.600
grace for us giving us new hearts that then

471
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.400
want to follow him want to give up everything for him. It

472
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.300
starts with God.

473
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.100
But what Jesus was doing with these parables?

474
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.100
Was he was weeding out the fans who

475
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.100
might merely be attracted to him

476
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.900
for the benefits that he offers.

477
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.200
In fact, there's an illustration of this in John chapter 6 where Jesus

478
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.900
had just fed the 5,000 with a Hebrew Happy Meal. Everybody's excited.

479
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.800
They want more food. So they show up in greater numbers.

480
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.000
Everybody's excited. Get some more get some more

481
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.500
more miracles and Jesus turns him and says no wait, actually what you

482
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.700
need is not food you need me.

483
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.100
And it says many.

484
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.400
Fans we would say turned away.

485
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.300
And walked off.

486
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.400
When it got a little too hard.

487
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.000
When it didn't turn out the way they wanted it to they left.

488
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.500
See he's weeding the fans out people like this

489
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.400
are only in it for themselves.

490
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.500
They want just a show of Miracles or they want heaven or they

491
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.500
just want provision or they just want an easier life or

492
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.200
whatever it is. They certainly do not want to

493
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.600
repent and deny themselves and follow him in

494
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.500
full obedience.

495
00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.900
See, that's what we call Easy believism.

496
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:01.900
cheap Grace

497
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.100
that this yeah, it's a part of my life. But this

498
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.600
is really where I want to live my life. That's why Jesus said

499
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.800
both Parables. They're intended to beg that question. Are

500
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.200
you able dunamis? Are you able to

501
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:16.700
follow me?

502
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.600
Do you have the capacity to do it because it cannot merely be

503
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.000
an emotional decision.

504
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.300
Following Christ cannot just be based on how you feel. You kind

505
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.400
of got swept up in the moment. It can't you really sad one

506
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.100
day and so you came to Jesus. It's not about that there must

507
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.600
also be this reality.

508
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.300
Because remember Jesus did not want fickle fans who

509
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.300
were in it for the parties.

510
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.500
He wanted faithful followers who were in it for

511
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.400
a purpose.

512
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.500
The purpose was to follow him see him

513
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.200
as king over everything in their

514
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:56.600
lives.

515
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.700
And listen, here's the reality. You're either a follower of Christ or

516
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.200
you're not

517
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.600
there are not two levels of Christianity.

518
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.300
Like there's there's this level of people who are really committed.

519
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.100
and then there's this level of people who

520
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.100
Who are more engaged with other aspects of life, but still claim to be

521
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:19.800
Christians?

522
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.000
There's no category for that in the Bible. There's there's not like Christian

523
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.400
and then disciple like those are the serious when

524
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.200
they're taking it seriously, but I'm okay. No, they're in the

525
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.100
in the categories of God's word there is disciple.

526
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:35.900
up here

527
00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.500
That's it. You're either a follower a disciple or

528
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.300
you are not and listen. We need to hear this church.

529
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.000
We in America need to be regularly reminded

530
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.600
that God is not calling us to a

531
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.100
comfortable middle-class. Lifestyle Where It's All About Us.

532
00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.200
Like we're somehow we've turned this into where we believe

533
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.300
a couple facts about Jesus, but then we just really try hard

534
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.000
not to cuss.

535
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.600
Like that's how it's all devolved down to somehow. That's

536
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.200
Christianity.

537
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.100
when Jesus is calling us to lay down our

538
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.600
lives to follow him in absolutely every way

539
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.100
every corner of my heart is his

540
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.100
Somewhere along the way we jettisoned this essential message

541
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.300
of Jesus for one that's easier.

542
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.400
I just come forward at the end of a service repeat this prayer get

543
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.400
baptized get your fire insurance and then go on

544
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.300
your life and live it. However you want to.

545
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.000
The problem with that is that we have unwittingly enabled thousands

546
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.300
of people to feel wrongly assured about

547
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.500
the relationship with Jesus.

548
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.100
And don't think we're just talking about everybody out there.

549
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.500
That happens in here, too.

550
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.300
That's what Jesus says in Luke 14 about following him must be

551
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.300
part of these equation.

552
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.500
We cannot pull back from the radical nature

553
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.200
of Jesus's words where he says

554
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.900
if you want to be my follower, then everything else is put

555
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.600
in second place.

556
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.600
but as I say that

557
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.400
this truth can lead to another way we get confused in

558
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:25.900
all of this.

559
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.900
Because we hear that and we start to think Jesus.

560
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.900
Teaching some kind of a workspace salvation here.

561
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.100
Like if I give up all this stuff, then I can

562
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:39.800
be saved.

563
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.500
Okay God what you're asking me to do is sell everything and

564
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.300
that will get me salvation. That's that's how our

565
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.900
minds tend to go as sinful humans. We jump there

566
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.900
that Jesus is saying earn it.

567
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.300
No, actually what he's teaching here is that if someone is

568
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.200
going to follow him if someone is going to be

569
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.600
his disciple, then they would do all of this in

570
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.100
response to who he is and to his salvation.

571
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.400
That they would see him as that and

572
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.800
then we say well, yep. Everything else is his that

573
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.700
they that they've been so changed in their heart that

574
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.900
they see him as better.

575
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:21.700
So they're willing.

576
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.700
That's what Jesus is doing here as he slices away

577
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.300
at easy believism.

578
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.400
as he says these hard words

579
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.800
Yes, they're hard. Yes. I wrestled with these I struggled with this all

580
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.500
week. Like these things are hard to hear

581
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.200
but as we see them.

582
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.800
As we think about the hate Love Thing by implication then

583
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.500
what Jesus is saying is

584
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.200
something must be worth it on the other end of this.

585
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.400
You get that logically.

586
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.000
That if Jesus is asking us to

587
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.400
die on a cross painfully.

588
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.800
When he knows it's hard for us to choose him over

589
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.400
everything else.

590
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.800
When he knows that that we're gonna fear loss

591
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.300
we're gonna fear lack that we're not gonna have what everybody else has We're

592
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.200
not gonna get to do whatever else is getting to do and we're gonna fear that

593
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.200
we're gonna see what if I lose my kids what we're gonna fear those

594
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.400
things. Yes in all of that.

595
00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.600
First of all, we know it must be Supernatural work of God for us to choose

596
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.800
that because that's not really that appealing.

597
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.000
not really attractive

598
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.400
It's not an easy message, right? There's a lot

599
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.500
of pain and so if Jesus is calling us

600
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.500
to all of that. That's what we must remember the

601
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.100
blessing of following Jesus.

602
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.600
We cannot forget the blessing

603
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.600
of following Jesus that he's offering something

604
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.000
here.

605
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.400
Not just calling us to give something up.

606
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:01.500
Think about this.

607
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.600
If Jesus is asking us to put our families and

608
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.500
our lives and our stuff on the table to

609
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.800
put it in second place.

610
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.500
then by implication

611
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.400
he is.

612
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.000
Offering something better than all of that.

613
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.900
Even the great things the good things. He's offering something better.

614
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.600
He's saying I am better. He's offering

615
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.100
a more desirable option than all of these things

616
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:30.800
that could let you down.

617
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.200
Don't put your hope in this put your hope in me. That'll let

618
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.900
you down you I will never let you down. I am enough.

619
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.300
See kids, I think you especially but all of us need to understand this

620
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:43.800
about God.

621
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.200
He's not up there some Cosmic killjoy just with

622
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.100
a smirk on his face hoping you suffer.

623
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.300
Like he's not Sid from Toy Story. Remember that the toy, right? And you're the toy

624
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.500
and you're you that's not God.

625
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.400
Listen to who God is this is Ephesians chapter 1 just listen

626
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.200
to the blessing that God's heart is

627
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.100
for you and for me read the whole book, but first Ephesians 1

628
00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:08.700
through 6.

629
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.600
Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who

630
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.100
has blessed us.

631
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.900
In Christ with every spiritual blessing in the Heavenly places.

632
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.300
Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of

633
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.600
the world that we should be holy blameless before him in love.

634
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.100
He predestined us for adoption to himself.

635
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.200
As Sons through Jesus Christ according to the purpose of

636
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.900
his will to the praise of his glorious Grace with which

637
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.800
he has blessed us.

638
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.400
in the Beloved

639
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.300
is that not an incredibly beneficial relationship?

640
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.300
Like you read the rest of it later, it talks about Redemption through his

641
00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.600
blood forgiveness of our sins wisdom from

642
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.500
above an internal inheritance his spirit

643
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.000
in side of us like those are amazing blessings,

644
00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.200
right?

645
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.300
So yes, this is a deer cost it will

646
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.400
cost us dearly to follow Jesus. But remember

647
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.600
in that we get God.

648
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.400
That's what's virgin said a couple of years ago how much

649
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.600
the gain exceeds the loss?

650
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.300
gain

651
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.600
of seeing and loving Jesus Above All Else exceeds

652
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.800
anything he would ask of me to give away.

653
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.800
But then here's what's interesting about this.

654
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.200
When you slot things correctly when you

655
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.900
order your life correctly?

656
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.300
And you love Jesus so much. It seems like you hate everything else

657
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.200
and and you put him first every decision you make is through him

658
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.500
and for him and everything else comes underneath that and fits in

659
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.300
accordingly when you do that.

660
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.900
All of those other things are blessed accordingly.

661
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.900
They're actually gonna function right? They're actually going to be healthy and

662
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.100
blessed by God in that. Like when you

663
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.600
when your spouse sees your heart transforms, you're

664
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.200
putting Jesus first man think of how that just knits your

665
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.800
relationship together that much more

666
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.400
when your coworkers

667
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.700
see you as a single woman.

668
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.000
live A Satisfied life

669
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.000
They are intrigued because they can't figure that one out.

670
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.300
Think of your kids growing up knowing a hundred percent

671
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.200
that Jesus was the king of your house because you

672
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.100
decided we're never going to miss church for a sport or an activity.

673
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.700
And they know 100% Mom and Dad pursued Jesus

674
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.800
that was first.

675
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.400
Your friends at school see what it looks like to truly be a believer

676
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.400
in Christ because you're actually putting him first over anything else

677
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.100
and they are changed by that.

678
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.200
Your money begins to to take on a new

679
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.700
purpose your job your hobbies all of that now flows through

680
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.400
the filter of glorifying God and living for his mission

681
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.600
think how blessed all of that stuff is in

682
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.200
light of that.

683
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.900
See Jesus was not sitting at that table.

684
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.100
Just pointing out all that was wrong with me.

685
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.500
His question of am I enough?

686
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.700
Was offering something better.

687
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.100
Was offering his Blessing.

688
00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:45.600
on my life

689
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.100
That's why I'm comfortable stepping into this role of

690
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.400
follower and not just be a fan.

691
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.200
Where Jesus is number one over everything else

692
00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.500
and and I put everything second. That's that's why I can

693
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.400
do it because I have confidence that he is enough that he is

694
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.200
better that there's nothing else I could pursue that's better than

695
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:07.400
him.

696
00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.200
So listen, if you're sitting there right

697
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.200
now and you're not sure whether you're a follower or a fan.

698
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.200
Just reflect on this question for a second.

699
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.200
Has the the faith that you Proclaim that you

700
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.400
claim to be has that cost you

701
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:30.900
anything.

702
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.700
externally with others

703
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.900
internally in your own heart in your life. Has it

704
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:41.600
cost you anything?

705
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.700
Has it asked you?

706
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.200
of anything

707
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.200
if it hasn't.

708
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.700
It might not be true faith in Jesus.

709
00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.100
Because this is what we've just seen from Jesus, right?

710
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.300
There's a cost involved.

711
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.300
And so the answer for you, if you see that you're like it hasn't

712
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.000
really cost me. It hasn't changed me hasn't done

713
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.300
anything in my life. If that's your answer the answer for you and

714
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.500
the answer for every single one of us is to see Jesus as Supreme.

715
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.500
To see him as number one.

716
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.900
And then to turn from that sin and that selfishness

717
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.300
and to turn to his life death and Resurrection

718
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.100
in my place in your place to turn to that

719
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.600
and to say Jesus. You are my boss. You are the master.

720
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.900
You're my Lord and Savior.

721
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.600
That's the answer that he will

722
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.700
then say. All right, you're in.

723
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.600
But I want you to remember this as you consider that as I consider

724
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.600
that as we walk in this world remember this.

725
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.200
As he's calling us to follow him like he has

726
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.900
described here.

727
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.700
Jesus is not asking us to do anything. He

728
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.900
has not done first.

729
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:03.800
He left heaven.

730
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.400
He left his father.

731
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:08.200
He

732
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.800
he took all of the things of the world and renounced them.

733
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.600
He didn't own anything.

734
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.600
He was never married. He never looked to

735
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.300
anything as his source, and then he was willing

736
00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.800
to die on a cross.

737
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.200
Not for his own sin, but for your sin and my

738
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.300
sin he did everything he is asking of

739
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:29.700
us.

740
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.900
And so yes, his costly Grace does lead

741
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.100
to a costly call that

742
00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:41.500
you must see him as enough. You must renounce all

743
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.400
the rights to your life. Yes, Grace leads to that

744
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.200
cost but he also empowers us

745
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.000
to do it.

746
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.400
Luke 18 Jesus says what is impossible with

747
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.400
man is possible with God?

748
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.300
Hush, I looked at this all week. You look

749
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.200
at this right now the match impossible Jesus you're asking me

750
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.400
to do something. I could never do you're right. What is impossible with

751
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.400
man is possible with God. So when you count the cost when

752
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.300
you hear the calls to follow him give your life

753
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.700
to him and trust him. He's going to empower you to do it.

754
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.100
How do I make that is how do I give that up? Jesus says, let me

755
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.800
I've been crucified with Christ. I no longer live Christ

756
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.500
lives in me.

757
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.500
He's like, I know you can't do it. Let me do it through you.

758
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.300
But this is the cost. This is the call.

759
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.600
Let's see him as worthy today.
