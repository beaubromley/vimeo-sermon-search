1
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.400
Well, good morning. Again Church. It is a joy that you

2
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
chose to be with us to gather with us

3
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.500
to celebrate this Advent season the

4
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.400
Incarnation that we celebrate in a couple weeks where

5
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.300
Christ God himself became flesh and

6
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.000
dwelt Among Us 2,000 years ago.

7
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.700
But as you've seen the last few weeks, we're not just celebrating these

8
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.500
these kind of five themes of Advent.

9
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.800
We're all looking forward to these words that we're talking about coming in

10
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.100
full someday. So like they were

11
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.500
waiting. We are waiting also to the time when

12
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.800
Jesus returns for his second Advent his

13
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.600
second coming when he appears that

14
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.000
word Advent means appearing

15
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.600
but these five words symbolized by the five candles are

16
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.700
massively important.

17
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.300
They're really like powerful summaries of the entire main

18
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.700
themes of the Bible when you

19
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.800
think through these words of Hope and peace and joy

20
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.400
and love and light. That's that's really the

21
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.100
main themes throughout and so we've looked

22
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.500
at Hope and peace already and now we are today going

23
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.800
to study the word joy and how Jesus fulfills

24
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.300
the joy of every longing heart.

25
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.300
Will be in Luke Chapter 2 to see a glimpse of that. So take

26
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.000
your copy of God's word turn there with me.

27
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.200
Luke Chapter 2 a very traditional Christmas passage,

28
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.300
you'll see

29
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.500
but Luke Chapter 2 verses 8 through 20 is where

30
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.200
we will be today.

31
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.800
As we turn there we need to get a handle on what

32
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.300
Joy even is.

33
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.500
How can we describe Joy?

34
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.300
How can we Define it? So we understand what we're even talking

35
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.400
about when we say the word Joy. How do we describe Joy? Well,

36
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.400
there are many different Hebrews in the Old Testament and Greek

37
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.500
in the New Testament words that are translated into English

38
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.600
as Joy.

39
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.500
And so we we like the other words. We've

40
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.400
already studied. It has a wide swath of meaning when

41
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.700
you think about what Joy means.

42
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.100
I even used one when I got up here a few moments ago that

43
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.400
I said it is a joy to

44
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.200
have you with us.

45
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.400
Well what that means is that there's this feeling that

46
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.200
comes it Wells up inside when I see you and I

47
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.500
I know that you came here to worship with us and that's that's

48
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500
a feeling an emotion that comes from

49
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.200
that that's actually one of the biblical nuances of

50
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.000
the word Joy talking about that feeling that

51
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.200
emotion of Joy where you feel

52
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.100
happiness.

53
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.500
You feel gladness. You feel joyful merriment like

54
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.900
Merry Christmas, like you feel these these delightful things.

55
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.000
It's the feeling you get when you go to a wedding.

56
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.300
Or when a child is born.

57
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.500
Or when you have this time together with your family and

58
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.600
or great friends at a party or when you're

59
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.200
you're alma mater wins the state championship like we

60
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.700
did last night at Fairview High School, you know, like that's that's Joy

61
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.300
you get from those moments you feel that

62
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.300
life is good you're doing well. And so

63
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.200
that Joy kind of Wells up inside you bubbles up. You almost

64
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.100
can't even control it. It just kind of flows up

65
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.200
the feeling you have.

66
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.900
Same thing can happen spiritually.

67
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.300
All over the book of Psalms. For example, Joy is

68
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.200
actually felt by Believers as they

69
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.100
encounter God.

70
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.600
God has surrounded them with his steadfast love. He's he's brought

71
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.900
them to Salvation. He's delivered them from his enemies. He's

72
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.400
given them his word. And so the the

73
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.300
emotion of Joy just Wells up in their lives.

74
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.300
It's what was felt in the parable when the shepherd found

75
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.400
his lost sheep.

76
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.600
Was much rejoicing when people saw someone be healed

77
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.500
by Jesus there was much rejoicing when when

78
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.800
adult Gentiles found out they didn't have to be circumcised. There

79
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.800
was much rejoicing among the people.

80
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.400
And listen those those are not wrong emotions to feel.

81
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.000
We should not feel guilty about feeling

82
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.700
joyful receiving Joy from

83
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.400
the good things. God has given us and created for

84
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.200
us to enjoy.

85
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.600
We shouldn't feel guilty about this God himself is

86
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.400
said to rejoice in his works and in

87
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.000
his people.

88
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.600
One of the most famous passages Luke 15 where there's the three parables

89
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.500
in a row about finding something that was lost. There is

90
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.200
said to be joy in heaven God

91
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.900
throws a party when someone repents and believes.

92
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.200
Zephaniah 3:17 is a well known verse that

93
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.900
describes how God views his people.

94
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.700
It says the Lord your God is in your midst a mighty one who will save he

95
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.400
will rejoice over you with gladness.

96
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.500
He will quiet you by his love. He will exalt over

97
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.300
you with loud singing.

98
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.700
Sounds like a party doesn't it sounds like Joy

99
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.500
sounds like happiness even back in Genesis 1:31 at

100
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.300
the very beginning. God saw everything that he had made

101
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.100
and behold. It was very good.

102
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.400
See, that's why you and I find joy in

103
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.700
the beautiful and good things of life.

104
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.100
Because God created us to do

105
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.300
that.

106
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.100
Like when that child snuggles up on your lap.

107
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.800
When you taste that pineapple at the resort on your honeymoon, like

108
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.000
maybe it's just something about that, but it was so good.

109
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.500
When you hear the birds chirping in the morning.

110
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.500
When you get that Adrenaline Rush after a good workout, when you you see

111
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.300
the Delight on someone's face, when you give generously to them

112
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.900
when you when you hug your grandpa at Christmas like those things

113
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.500
you feel that's right and good.

114
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.400
We should find joy in those things because we're made

115
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.200
in God's image.

116
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.100
And if he finds joy in good things

117
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.900
like that, then we ought to as well.

118
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.700
In fact First Timothy 6 verse 17

119
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.000
gives us license to be. Joyful.

120
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.400
It says As for the rich in this present age charges them

121
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.200
not to be prideful nor to set their hopes on

122
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.200
the uncertainty of riches but to set their hopes on God

123
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.600
who check this out richly provides us

124
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.000
with everything to enjoy.

125
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.900
Now I've done this with the word encourage before like encourage means

126
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.700
to give courage to someone enjoying something

127
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.400
means it gives you Joy.

128
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.100
God's given us things to give us

129
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.700
joy.

130
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.300
See, I think we get the wrong picture of God. He's not a cosmic

131
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.400
killjoy up there. Just going after you making you sad.

132
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.500
He's actually for your joy. He's

133
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.300
after your joy he wants it for you.

134
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.800
CS Lewis said that Joy is the serious business

135
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.500
of Heaven.

136
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.900
This is God's deal.

137
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.800
But God's word is also very clear.

138
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.800
That Joy is more than merely a Feeling.

139
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.300
It's more than just an emotion.

140
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.100
Because what happens when things aren't good.

141
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.800
When you don't win the game.

142
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.200
What happens when the holidays?

143
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:40.700
are hard

144
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.100
what happens when you feel alone?

145
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.700
What happens when like in our story?

146
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.900
When your wife gets pregnant immediately after having your

147
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.500
first son and has a miscarriage at

148
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:56.900
12 weeks.

149
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.500
Like if Joy is a Feeling.

150
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.700
Then we're sunk.

151
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.500
Because it's tears. That's all it is.

152
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.800
There's no feeling.

153
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.500
So Joy has to be something more. That's why the true biblical concept

154
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.400
of joy is more than just happiness. It goes deeper

155
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.800
it lasts.

156
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.600
Because it's based on something more solid than your circumstance.

157
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.500
So as we describe joy, we must also point out the times that

158
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.500
it is more of an action than it

159
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.100
is a Feeling.

160
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.000
Joy is actually at times commanded.

161
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.800
That you are to choose Joy.

162
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.200
No matter what you face in your life.

163
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.700
But that's one reason God's word is so helpful because you read

164
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.300
through God's word.

165
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.200
And you see that the Bible is not just this Joy Fest

166
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.100
where everything is easy and fun.

167
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.300
Right. This thing is hard. They face a lot of hard things right

168
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.400
people throughout the Bible face death. They face lost.

169
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.300
They face persecution. They face selfishness family

170
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.400
Strife all over the place, right? They

171
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.900
faced all of it.

172
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.700
Yet even in those situations.

173
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.700
They and we are commanded to

174
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.300
rejoice.

175
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.400
Just listen to what Jesus said.

176
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.500
Regarding persecution Matthew 5

177
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.400
verses 11 and 12 blessed are

178
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.300
you when others revile you and persecute you

179
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.100
and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my

180
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.500
account.

181
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.400
rejoice and be glad

182
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.100
for your reward is great in heaven.

183
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.800
For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

184
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.500
The Apostle Paul commanded it in Philippians

185
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.300
4:4. He says rejoice in the lord always again.

186
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.700
I'll say rejoice.

187
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.400
He doesn't say rejoice in the Lord when things are good

188
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.200
rejoice in Lord, most of the time rejoice in

189
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.800
the lord always and he repeats it for emphasis Rejoice

190
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.100
at all times. Even when

191
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.500
you face trials James one two says

192
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.600
Says you were to count it all joy when You Face trials

193
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.000
because the testing of your faith is what's going to produce steadfastness and

194
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.200
character in your life. Count that Joy.

195
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.700
Not a feeling results.

196
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.500
How do we get there?

197
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.400
How do we get to that? How do we have joy?

198
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.600
in the midst of struggle

199
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.600
in the midst of a world that's gone crazy.

200
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.000
In light of our own sin, how do we have joy in

201
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.600
this? How can we find? How can we choose Joy

202
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.300
here?

203
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.700
We'll get to it in a second.

204
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.000
Kind of the deep theological. Let me give you a couple simple easy ways

205
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.800
that you can walk this way to

206
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.800
find Joy first. It's getting into God's word.

207
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.200
When you're in the dark the hard places Psalm

208
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.800
16:11 shows us in his presence. There

209
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.900
is fullness of joy.

210
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.800
At his right hand are Pleasures forevermore. So God's word

211
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.800
is where we first can find Joy but also John

212
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.400
16:24. Jesus said until now you've

213
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.800
asked nothing in my name ask pray, and

214
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.400
you'll receive that your joy may be full.

215
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.200
So two simple ways God's word

216
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.100
in prayer getting into his presence just being with him fullness of

217
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.400
joy.

218
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.900
But here's how we can be assured of Joy even in struggle.

219
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.400
Even when it's hard, even when you lose a loved one, whatever it

220
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.700
is because of what Luke 2 teaches us.

221
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.100
This is how we can have joy.

222
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.700
Because what the Old Testament states were waiting for.

223
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.300
Everybody before Luke 2 all the way back to the beginning what

224
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.200
they were longing for what they were waiting for was eternal

225
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:17.700
Joy.

226
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.300
Because they could have joy and we'll talk about in a second. They can have joy

227
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.700
here and there and fits it pieces all that but but they're

228
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.700
all longing for this eternal Joy. It's what Isaiah prophesied

229
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.000
700 years for Jesus came, Isaiah 51:11.

230
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.200
He's looking forward to the day The

231
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.500
Ransom of the Lord shall return come to Zion

232
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.300
with singing Everlasting Joy shall

233
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.100
be upon their heads.

234
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.800
They shall obtain gladness and joy.

235
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.100
And sorrow and sighing shall flee

236
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.200
away.

237
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.800
See what they were longing for.

238
00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.800
They're longing for joy.

239
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.300
For this deep rooted abiding Joy because

240
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.600
remember they've been exiled out of the Promised Land.

241
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.600
Because of their sin they'd experienced Carnage

242
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.700
and loss.

243
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.600
Even a couple hundred years later, they returned to the promised

244
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.000
land, but it wasn't the same.

245
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.500
And they're looking around and they're like God we we see we're

246
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.800
here again, but this is not it right.

247
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.600
And they knew they remembered that God over and

248
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.600
over had promised a redeemer.

249
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.500
Promised that someone would come to bring

250
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.000
that Joy again that someday they

251
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.600
would welcome that Joy again.

252
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.200
They knew it was coming. God had promised it someday, they'd

253
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.200
welcome Joy the fullness of joy would enter in.

254
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.600
Well, that's what we finally see the arrival of in Luke Chapter

255
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:55.900
2.

256
00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.500
The fullness of joy has arrived Luke

257
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.000
2 verses 8 through 20. You'll recognize this as a

258
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.100
Christmas Passage.

259
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.200
In the same region there were shepherds out in

260
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.500
the field.

261
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.200
Keeping watch over their flock by night.

262
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.700
And an angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord Shone around

263
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.900
them and they were filled with great fear and the

264
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.900
angel said to them fear not.

265
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.700
For behold I bring you good news of great.

266
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.500
Joy

267
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.300
That will be for all the people.

268
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.500
For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a

269
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.300
savior who's Christ the lord

270
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.500
And this will be a sign for you. You'll find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths

271
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.300
lying in a Manger.

272
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.200
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of

273
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.000
the Heavenly Host praising God saying glory to God in the

274
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.800
highest on Earth. Peace among those with whom he's pleased.

275
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.200
When the angels went away from them into heaven the shepherd said to one

276
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.600
another let's go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that's happened, which the

277
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.500
Lord has made known to us.

278
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.100
And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the

279
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.200
baby lying in a Manger.

280
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.200
And when they saw it, they made known the saying they'd been told them concerning this

281
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.000
child and all who heard it wondered at what the Shepherds told them. But

282
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.100
Mary treasured up all these things pondering them

283
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:13.700
in our heart.

284
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.400
And the Shepherds returned out to their field glorifying

285
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.400
and praising God for all

286
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.500
they had heard and seen as it had been told them.

287
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.400
So we see this this baby born

288
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.100
who who is declared to be all of

289
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.200
these things, right? You see it the son of David that's the prophecy fulfilled

290
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.800
of who he was going to be born in Bethlehem, Micah

291
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.100
5. We saw that a couple weeks ago. That was fulfilled.

292
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.000
The Savior the Lord the the promised Messiah was

293
00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.800
coming and finally.

294
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.400
here

295
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.000
But instead of being afraid of that reality the angel

296
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.300
said to the Shepherds guys, you don't need to be afraid

297
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.400
of this because he's not coming with the sword yet.

298
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.900
He's not coming to judge yet.

299
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.900
He's actually bringing Joy.

300
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.200
They brought good news.

301
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.300
To these with these Shepherds that were cast off

302
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.400
from sighted about great news of great. Joy to

303
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.300
them that the Messiah had come.

304
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.400
Don't be afraid.

305
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.800
Because what's been promised for Generations, you're finally seeing.

306
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.200
He's come. He's shown up. Look, he's here this baby that

307
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.300
would forgive sins and guide his people into peace. He's here.

308
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.500
This is the one you've been waiting for. This was the promise fulfilled.

309
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.400
The Messiah is here.

310
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.200
No wonder the Shepherds were Overjoyed as they

311
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.200
went back home. Did you see what they were doing? Right they were full

312
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.300
of joy. They were glorifying and praising God

313
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.400
for what they had just heard and seen.

314
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.700
They finally had seen that longing in

315
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.800
their hearts. Remember what they were longing for for Generation. They

316
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.900
finally saw it fulfilled.

317
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.000
the joy of their longing heart

318
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.900
because remember before that.

319
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.700
There was only partial Joy.

320
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.500
There was there was mere glimpses of God's

321
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.500
Deliverance throughout Israel's history.

322
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.500
Now those moments did bring joy.

323
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.700
Those those moments did did bring Joys

324
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.000
I remembered back to how God had delivered them. Especially out

325
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.700
of Egypt.

326
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.100
numbers 10 10 commands them to Mark those

327
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.500
moments with with times of rejoicing it

328
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:34.900
says

329
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:36.800
like guys remember

330
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.500
You're my people you need to remember. That's what the whole

331
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.300
thing about the Passover the feast the Feast of

332
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.700
unleavened bread the Pentecost celebration the Feast

333
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.000
of Tabernacles that was all for the idea

334
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.600
to remind them that they were once slaves

335
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.700
and God delivered them.

336
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:54.900
remember

337
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.300
Don't forget Rejoice over the fact that you not

338
00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:58.800
in Egypt anymore.

339
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:00.600
You're here.

340
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.800
And in those festivals you go read through all of them. They are commanded

341
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.700
to rejoice.

342
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.400
They didn't have an option. They were commanded to Rejoice

343
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.300
because of what God had done because he had helped them before they

344
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.500
say here's what you do in this

345
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.100
celebration.

346
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:21.900
but again

347
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.100
Even as they celebrated those things.

348
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.600
Even as they look back and saw Egypt, they saw the Red Sea split.

349
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.700
There was still an element of longing in those

350
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.400
celebrations.

351
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.600
It was still only partial Joy.

352
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.300
Because think about where they were celebrating that party.

353
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.400
They're in the middle of the desert.

354
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.400
They're vulnerable.

355
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.100
The promised land is still miles away somewhere way over there.

356
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.000
We don't know where it is.

357
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.000
And then later they're in Exile. They're commanded

358
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.400
to celebrate these Feast under the authority

359
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.800
of the Babylonian Empire.

360
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.600
They're away from the land still under

361
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.000
oppression. And God says yes celebrate. Don't

362
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.800
forget remember.

363
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.300
And so yes, they were commanded to rejoice in God's

364
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.400
past Deliverance.

365
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.200
But they were still longing until Luke 2 happens. They were

366
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.400
still longing for full Joy.

367
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.000
for full restoration

368
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.400
But think about that is that not similar for us today?

369
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.500
See we can look back at Luke 2 and see that this Christ

370
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.400
child in Bethlehem called the Lord and the Savior.

371
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.600
We know that he came and did accomplish

372
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.300
the work.

373
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.000
Because he didn't stay a baby right like Christmas is part of

374
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.300
it, but then you've got Easter come you've got the whole story right?

375
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.200
There's more to the story than just Jesus in a manger.

376
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.400
Because he grew up and he lived the perfect life that you and I

377
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.400
could never live.

378
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.100
And then he died the death that we deserve to

379
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.500
defeat the enemy that was keeping us enslaved to

380
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.100
our sin.

381
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.700
And then he rose again from Death to

382
00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.100
defeat that enemy that there's no way we could

383
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.100
defeat on our own like this is what he was doing. Praise the

384
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.900
lord we can look back and say he did it.

385
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.300
This good news about Jesus here. This this should

386
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.400
give us great joy too as we look back to our deliverance. This

387
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.300
should give us in a spark in us a

388
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.700
desire to Rejoice the ability to Rejoice

389
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.300
because just like for them with Exodus their

390
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.800
greatest enemy Was Defeated our greatest enemy

391
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.400
is defeated our sin in Jesus life

392
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.200
death and Resurrection.

393
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.000
So Rejoice, right?

394
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.500
So we should have joy and it

395
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.300
should also not just for you on your own. It should

396
00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.100
ignite in us together a great celebration Every

397
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:06.000
Time We Gather just like the feast

398
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.700
in the Old Testament.

399
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.100
At Passover they would gather together and they

400
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.200
would celebrate together and with joy they would

401
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:13.400
remember.

402
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.400
It's the same for us as we remember what God has

403
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.800
done as we gather together. In fact, Joy is

404
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.900
part of one of our churches values.

405
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.700
Life Giving hope

406
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.100
where we reflect the Gospel of

407
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.500
Jesus Christ with delight.

408
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.200
by building relationships and environments infused

409
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.200
with Grace and with joy

410
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:45.500
in other words

411
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.500
you and I need what we call gospel-centered Community.

412
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.500
to enjoy

413
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.800
remember we need people.

414
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.700
To help give us joy.

415
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.200
And every time we gather as a

416
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.800
church like this, these should be life-giving.

417
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.800
These should be joy infusing to

418
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.500
us that we walk out of here not remembering me

419
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.300
or anyone else up here, but we remember how great our

420
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.700
God is and we walk out here with a little more. Joy, right?

421
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.300
That's what this is supposed to be.

422
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.300
But here's what else that means.

423
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.700
If you sit there week by week.

424
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:34.900
unmoved

425
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.000
by the grace of Jesus

426
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.800
if you can look at this gospel.

427
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.600
And not be stirred in your heart over what

428
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.900
Jesus has done for you?

429
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.300
Unless you should be concerned about that.

430
00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.400
You should be worried about the state

431
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.900
of your heart and your soul.

432
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.700
Now I get it. Listen, I get it that there's Dark Knights

433
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.200
of the soul in our lives where where it's a

434
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.600
fight to lift your eyes to Jesus. Absolutely that happens.

435
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.700
I've been there and so let me just talk to you keep stepping

436
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.400
forward in faith, like keep battling. Keep going

437
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.700
towards him every day lift your eyes lift your

438
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.300
eyes. Yes.

439
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.400
But if you weak by week by

440
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.600
week by month by year are completely

441
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.700
indifferent.

442
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.500
To how sinful you really are.

443
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.300
Or to how gracious God really is to give

444
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.200
you salvation.

445
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.500
Then you need to repent and believe.

446
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.600
Like joy joy is a natural byproduct of

447
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.100
salvation.

448
00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.900
It's part of the deal because just think about well, we were

449
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.800
still sinners Christ died for us. Well, we

450
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.700
were still sinners Christ made us as children. He adopted

451
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.200
us into his family and said I want you in my family. I'm gonna

452
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.500
pay for my you're with with my son's life. I'm gonna

453
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.700
pay for you to be in here with me. What great love

454
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.200
is this

455
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.400
Like what great joy, that should

456
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.300
create in us, right?

457
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.000
Because listen whether things are good or things are bad in your

458
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.500
life when you believe that Jesus is Love

459
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.700
overcame death itself.

460
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.900
Then Joy becomes reasonable.

461
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.100
and even the darkest of circumstances

462
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.200
even death cannot overcome him.

463
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.300
So whatever I'm facing today can't be

464
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.600
worse than that. And so it gives me joy.

465
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.700
Listen, it's possible friend.

466
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.000
Even if you don't feel it right now.

467
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.600
Joy is possible because it's not found in circumstances. It's

468
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.100
found in him.

469
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.800
That's the whole point of this is that Jesus gives Joy, but

470
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.200
here's again, I know.

471
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.300
Similar to Israel of old. The reality is

472
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.300
that we are also still waiting for something to

473
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.200
the fact that I had to even talk about the Dark Night of the soul and those kind

474
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.200
of things like that's the reality is that we're still getting knocked down

475
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.100
every day.

476
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.100
We have an enemy trying to steal our joy every

477
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.100
day continually trying to take it away from

478
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.300
us. We have this reality John 10:10. Jesus said

479
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.800
it's here. The enemy comes to steal kill and

480
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.200
destroy.

481
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.900
We're still in the middle of this some of you feel it.

482
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.400
But remember Jesus didn't stop there. He said that I came that

483
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.200
they may have life and have it abundantly.

484
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.500
So again, you can have that Abundant Life. Now

485
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.900
you can have this Joy Now by welcoming Jesus

486
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.500
so that his Joy can

487
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.500
be in you and your joy may be full John

488
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.400
15 says

489
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.500
he's not talking about only after you die.

490
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.000
He's talking about even now.

491
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.300
It's just that we're gonna have to look for him.

492
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.400
And for that satisfying Joy through a bit of a mess.

493
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.300
right now

494
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.500
I read this powerful illustration from Paul Thigpen. He's

495
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.300
writing this from his his first person perspective. Listen to

496
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.500
this. He says I remember coming home one afternoon to discover

497
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.400
that the kitchen. I had worked so hard to clean only a

498
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.900
few hours before was now a terrible wreck.

499
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.900
My young daughter had obviously been busy cooking.

500
00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.700
And the ingredients were scattered along with dirty bowls utensils across

501
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.300
the counters and the floor. I was not happy with

502
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:54.900
the situation.

503
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.500
But then as I looked a little more closely at the mess, I spied a

504
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.500
tiny little note on the table.

505
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.700
clumsily written and smeared with chocolatey fingerprints

506
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.500
and the message was short.

507
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.200
I'm making something for you Dad.

508
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.300
And it was signed your angel.

509
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.100
And so in the midst of that disarray and despite my irritation Joy

510
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.200
suddenly sprang up in

511
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.500
my heart.

512
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.300
sweet and pure

513
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.300
my attention had been redirected from the problem to the

514
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.200
little girl that I loved.

515
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.100
And as I encountered her in that brief note I delighted

516
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.400
in her.

517
00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.700
with her single simple goodness in focus

518
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.500
I could take pleasure in seeing her hand at work in

519
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.300
a situation that seemed otherwise disastrous.

520
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.700
The church the same is true of our joy in the Lord.

521
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.400
Galatians 5:22 says one of the fruits of the spirit of

522
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.700
God living inside you is joy.

523
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.500
Which means we can look through

524
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.700
the mess and we can welcome joy

525
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.300
as we see God making something

526
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.100
for us in the middle of all of it. No matter

527
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:19.800
what we face.

528
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.500
Now I'm not saying we pretend that our problems don't exist or hardship

529
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.400
doesn't exist. We just know that true Joy transcends

530
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.100
our suffering because we

531
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.100
know suffering will not have the final word.

532
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.300
It's what Paul said in sync Corinthians 6:10. He said we can

533
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.800
be sorrowful yet always rejoicing you can

534
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.500
have both at the same time. It's a miracle of

535
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.200
God's grace that we can still have joy in it now

536
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.100
now listen you might have to fight hard for the joy.

537
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.800
You might have to look hard for it. You might have to cling to

538
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.000
him for it.

539
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.400
But you're not the first.

540
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:00.800
To have to do that.

541
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.500
It's the same at habakkuk face and

542
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.000
chapter 3

543
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.100
says though the Fig Tree should not blossom.

544
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.200
Nor fruit beyond the vines the produce of

545
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.600
the olive fail the fields yield no food.

546
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.300
The flock be cut off from the fold and they're

547
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.600
being no herd in the Stalls. Basically no income. No.

548
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.400
Hope of income nothing to eat.

549
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:29.600
Yet.

550
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.100
I will rejoice in the Lord.

551
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.200
I will take joy in the god of

552
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.600
my salvation.

553
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.200
It's there for you.

554
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.800
Yet again.

555
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:49.900
Even in that.

556
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.500
There's still an element of longing, right?

557
00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.000
Because we're still looking through the mess.

558
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.500
Even though I could have joy even want

559
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.500
to facing nothing. I got nothing I got no. Hope of anything I can

560
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.100
still have joy, but they're still looking through the

561
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.500
mess. Our bodies are still broken. The enemy still rages

562
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.900
against us family still struggle. It's still here

563
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.200
and we can have abundant Joy

564
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.500
now, but we also like they did we look

565
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.600
forward to the day when we can welcome that

566
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.400
full joy that Everlasting joy that

567
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.000
was promised back in Isaiah 51.

568
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.600
Like we can look to that day when we enter into it's one

569
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.600
of the Parables Jesus gives we enter into the joy

570
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.800
of our master.

571
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.800
It's the very presence of God.

572
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800
face to face

573
00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.000
It's what the end of Revelation describes.

574
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.200
That not only will there be perfect. Peace.

575
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.400
No more sin. No More Death no more pain.

576
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.800
There's going to be full Joy someday as well.

577
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.400
where those

578
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.700
Those feasts in the Old Testament what they were symbolizing what

579
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.300
they were giving tastes of is we throw a party for

580
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.100
what God's done. Remember what he did in the past over. We're having a

581
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.500
great time looking forward to something coming all that

582
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.900
in. The Book of Revelation is finally completed. It's finally

583
00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.600
brought back together where we celebrate not only

584
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.400
by looking back to what he's done, but also

585
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.100
looking face to face at our God himself.

586
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.400
That's what the Apostle John saw in heaven. We looked there Revelation 19:6

587
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.100
and 70 says I heard what seem to be

588
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.200
the voice of a great multitude like the Roar of many Waters the

589
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.900
sound of many peels of Thunder crying out Hallelujah. Like

590
00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.600
we sang earlier for the Lord Our God the

591
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.200
Almighty Reigns, let us rejoice let

592
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.600
us exult and give him the glory for

593
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.300
the marriage of the Lamb has come the bride has

594
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.000
made herself ready.

595
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.900
So here's what this is doing. This is previewing what's called The Wedding Feast

596
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.700
someday where this this group

597
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.400
of people the Believers that are in him

598
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.300
that's us Christians called the bride of

599
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.700
Christ. We come to this party. We're finally finished

600
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.800
being prepared and the groom himself enters

601
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.500
into the party and forever. We will

602
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.400
together worship and joy and

603
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.200
gladness and celebration for all that. He

604
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.500
is all that he's done and all that. He has given us

605
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.200
praise God. We look forward to that day. Don't

606
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:28.400
we

607
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.400
and we say like the end of revelation 22 come quickly Lord

608
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:35.700
Jesus.

609
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.200
Because we want full Joy.

610
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.900
But also listen to this.

611
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.000
Because we are so Overjoyed by that gospel message

612
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.300
and by that future that is coming for

613
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.400
us. Listen. We should not hoard that Joy.

614
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.800
This should not merely be for

615
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.300
us. Remember what the angel told the Shepherds that

616
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:02.700
night?

617
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.100
Luke 2:10

618
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.100
Look at it again. He says.

619
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.500
Fear not for behold I bring you good news

620
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.800
of great joy.

621
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.700
That will be for all the people.

622
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.000
see that

623
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.400
this good news of great joy is for all the

624
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:25.700
people.

625
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.100
All the peoples meaning this is a global gospel

626
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.800
the truth that Jesus himself repeated

627
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.900
throughout his ministry Matthew 5:14. You're

628
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.200
the light of the world a city on a hill

629
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.300
cannot be hidden Matthew 24:14. This Gospel of the Kingdom

630
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.300
will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a

631
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.500
testimony to All Nations Matthew 28:19 go and

632
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.300
make disciples of all Nations Acts 1:8, you'll

633
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.100
be my Witnesses Jerusalem Judea Samaria to the end of

634
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.200
the Earth So Hear Me Church Advent must not

635
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.100
be a time that we just get together and celebrate internally. We

636
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.300
have a great time remembering what God's done

637
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.300
in the past what he's going to do in the future rejoicing over that

638
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.600
No, this must Propel us outward to where

639
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.600
we Proclaim joy as we have received

640
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.100
it as we've welcomed it. We Proclaim it

641
00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.600
to all the people that there is good news of great joy,

642
00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.500
that is calm and this Joy is found.

643
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.200
in him

644
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.300
that Joy we're talking about.

645
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.600
Should be fuel for the mission.

646
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.100
Like why are we going to go? Why would we ever sacrifice

647
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.200
to what we have here the Comforts and

648
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.100
go somewhere else move to the other side of the world Goss the

649
00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.300
street and share like, why would we do that and and make things hard for

650
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.100
ourselves without the Joy on the other side?

651
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.500
That's what Jesus did.

652
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.700
Hebrews 12:2 for the joy set before

653
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.200
him endured the cross

654
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.400
He knew it was there. He saw the other side. He

655
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.600
saw the results not feeling good going to the Cross but

656
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.600
he saw the result of what it was going to bring and so for the joy set

657
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.300
before him. He endured that cross. So we

658
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.500
who have received his joy and we have

659
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.300
overwhelmingly Been Changed by his

660
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.600
joy. We must go Proclaim that Joy

661
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.300
that we have it.

662
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.300
No matter what. We're facing in our life.

663
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.200
No matter what. We're facing circumstantially that we have it you better

664
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.500
in our lives. We better Proclaim Joy just simply by

665
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.400
living a life. That looks different.

666
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.500
When you lose a loved one when you face trials financially that

667
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.100
your life is full of joy from the

668
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.100
Lord as your strength.

669
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.500
We Proclaim Joy just by being that kind of

670
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.900
Lifestyle, but also that that Joy is

671
00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.500
available to a weary world around

672
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:52.800
us.

673
00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.500
To those who are hurting to those who are dark This Joy

674
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.600
is available because listen if the Lord God

675
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.200
Almighty has kindled a fire in the

676
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.200
dead cold fireplace of your heart.

677
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.200
What else can you do but respond by by joyfully

678
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.300
living in response to that and

679
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.600
joyfully going in response to that.

680
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.300
There's no better way to respond.

681
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.400
By living and proclaiming joy to all

682
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:24.900
the people.

683
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.000
And so that candle of joy is what we're going to light this morning.

684
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.500
As we both look back and look ahead this third candle

685
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.600
of the Advent wreath. We've talked about hope

686
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.100
We've talked about peace and now we add the

687
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:41.900
element of joy.

688
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.200
That Christ has come to bring in Christ will fully

689
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.100
bring one day.

690
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.200
I don't invite the Crawford Family up here to lead us through

691
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.500
that today Marcus is one of our deacons and they co-lead a

692
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.700
community group together in both markets and Kristen serve

693
00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.300
Faithfully in many ways and our kids ministry.

694
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.200
And their family's going to light the candle read some scripture pointing us to the

695
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.800
Messiah and then pray for our joy together.

696
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.300
Of the increase of his government and of Peace, there will be

697
00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.100
no end on the throne of David and over his kingdom to establish

698
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.500
it and to uphold it with Justice and with

699
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.200
righteousness from the time forth and forevermore.

700
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.400
The Zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. The Lord

701
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.300
has sent word against Jacob and it

702
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.500
will fall on Israel.

703
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.500
And all the people will know Ephraim and the evidence

704
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.300
of Samaria who say in Pride in an arrogance

705
00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.200
of heart. The bricks have fallen, but we will build with

706
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.600
dress Stones the sycamores have been got town, but we'll

707
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.800
put cedars in their place.

708
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.900
Would you pray with me Church?

709
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.300
Father we are thankful for for the prophets

710
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.200
of old for the prophets like Isaiah that foretold of

711
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.200
the coming of Jesus father. I can't imagine the

712
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.000
anticipation that the people had father for

713
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.400
us on this side of that. We see it to

714
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.000
be absolute truth.

715
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.200
And God, we we praise your

716
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.400
name for for sending Jesus.

717
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.500
as Our Redeemer father as as our

718
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.500
joy May that his birth and

719
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.300
and the way that he lived a perfect life died for us

720
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:03.900
father made that

721
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.500
fuel us.

722
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.400
To share the joy that we have for the world father.

723
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.400
God send us as a church to do just that to

724
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.400
proclaim the name of Jesus as Our Redeemer. Amen.
