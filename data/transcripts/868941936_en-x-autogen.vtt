00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.160
Hi, I am Phil Sly.

2
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.960
I'm the pastor of Discipleship and Community here at Henderson Hills,

3
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.520
and we're looking at, uh, community group training.

4
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.280
This is a philosophical and passionate and practical approach to how we can do

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.200
community groups better.

6
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.360
And this video we'll be looking at the community group missions discipleship

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.800
coordinator, and we can agree that in a consumerist world,

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.160
it's often driven by self-interest and personal gain.

9
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.680
And so the concept of Christian service and relational discipleship

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.680
stands in contrast as a powerful reminder to the true essence of

11
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.880
faith. And so, uh,

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.800
we can live sent by sending disciples from our community group to love and

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.960
to serve in homes, in ministries, in neighborhoods, in the city,

14
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.360
and even across the nations.

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.960
And so the role of the Mission Discipleship coordinator is to challenge

16
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.280
community group members to live sin.

17
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.320
We call our community group people to participate in missions opportunities and

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.320
to encourage micro group involvement. So in this video,

19
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.840
we're gonna highlight three sections. Number one,

20
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.080
we're gonna look at scriptural support for missions and discipleship

21
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.480
involvement. Number two,

22
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm gonna show you a list of Henderson Hill's mission's opportunities.

23
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.120
And then lastly,

24
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.640
we're gonna look at a process for encouraging micro group involvement. So let's,

25
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.480
first of all look at scriptural support for missions and discipleship. Uh,

26
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.120
this first passage is, uh, grounded in the teachings of Jesus.

27
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.640
And Jesus taught us that serving others is cherished by God.

28
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.120
In Matthew 25 35, it says, uh, I was hungry and you gave me food.

29
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.640
I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.

30
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480
I was naked, and you clothed me. Now, remember,

31
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.360
this is Jesus sharing the parable that expresses how serving others literally

32
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.440
blesses him, blesses God. And when I was in prison,

33
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.600
you came to me and the righteous and him will answer saying,

34
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.440
when did that happen? When did we feed you?

35
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.320
When did we give you something in the drink? When did we clothe you?

36
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.480
And listen to this in verse in the final verse 40, it says,

37
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.480
truly I say to you as you did it to one of the least of these my

38
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.800
brothers, you did it to me. So Jesus is emphasizing that, uh,

39
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.720
that this is a significant to obey God's mission, John,

40
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.160
not just for obedience sake,

41
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.560
but we act in engages and we engage acts of charity by feeding

42
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.680
the hungry and providing water and caring for those less fortunate.

43
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.720
These are actions that are deeply cherished by God. As a matter of fact,

44
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.360
when these things are done to the least of his people, it's done to him.

45
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.800
Number two, serving others is exemplified by Christ. In Mark 10 45,

46
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.640
uh, Jesus said, for even the son of man did not come to be served,

47
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.160
but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.

48
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.400
So Jesus sets the ultimate example of service Through his own life,

49
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.040
the gospel speaks of his death, burial, and resurrection.

50
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.360
Why would we expect different from ourselves?

51
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.200
His sacrificial love for us demonstrates that genuine service

52
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.880
involves putting others' needs before one's own needs.

53
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.720
And so when Christians follow Jesus' example, they embraced Christ's heart.

54
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.880
They have a servant's heart that draws,

55
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.600
draws them closer to Christ and understands the essence of his teachings.

56
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.440
They experience personal transformation and they shed selfish desires.

57
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.360
They find joy in making a positive impact on others. Next,

58
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.720
serving others is the solution for selfishness. In Galatians five 13,

59
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.360
the apostle Paul says, for you are once called to freedom brothers only.

60
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.480
Do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh,

61
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.240
but through love serve one another.

62
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.400
Paul's letter to the gr to the Galatians remind us that true service is, uh,

63
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.160
rooted in love and in humility.

64
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.560
And if we will humbly serve and love one another's, then uh,

65
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.960
we'll learn to overcome our own personal selfishness. It, uh,

66
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.760
it serves to nurture a spirit of gratitude,

67
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.120
and it acknowledges that all we have comes from God serving shares

68
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.720
those blessings with others. It not only blesses them,

69
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.960
but it literally strengthens our own faith and our own relationship with Jesus.

70
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.333
And two other things,

71
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.000
serving others as to the Lord will be rewarded now serving, uh,

72
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.920
to receive a reward that's the least possible of motivations. However,

73
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.080
Ephesians, uh, Ephesians 6, 7 8, Paul says,

74
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.840
rendering service with a goodwill asked to the Lord and not to man,

75
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.280
knowing that whatever good anyone does this,

76
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.080
he will receive back from the Lord.

77
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.400
So by serving wholeheartedly and selflessly, Paul says, we will receive back.

78
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.200
Now, we don't know exactly what that recept reception will look like,

79
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.360
but we can understand that our serving to the Lord is an offering, and it,

80
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.400
it elevates the Lord and it teaches us and gives us a,

81
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.880
a greater sense of eternal significance. Uh,

82
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.320
next serving others exercises, spiritual gifts.

83
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.560
Peter said in one Peter four 10 that, uh, uh,

84
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.920
Christian gifts are given, uh, Christians are given unique gifts and talents,

85
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.800
and those are meant to be used to serve others. He said,

86
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.840
each of you should use whatever gift you've received to serve others as

87
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.960
faithful stewards of God's grace.

88
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.600
So when Christians utilize their talents and service,

89
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.920
it reinforces the understanding that our abilities, our talents,

90
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.360
our gifts are given to us by God.

91
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.560
And so exercising these spiritual gifts that enhances our ability to serve,

92
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.440
but it also brings glory to God.

93
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.240
Christian service is not just an act of kindness.

94
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.520
It's a way of life that's deeply rooted in the teachings of Jesus.

95
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.200
And so when Christians selflessly serve others,

96
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.720
they embody the love and compassion and humility that Christ showed.

97
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.240
When Christians serve,

98
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.680
they contribute to creating a more compassionate and loving world,

99
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.160
and they reflect the heart of Jesus to all they serve. Uh,

100
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.160
what I can ask you to do during this video or after this video,

101
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.680
is to actually go onto our website, hhbc.com,

102
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.440
and then put forward slash mission.

103
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.200
And there you'll see a list of opportunities to serve at Henderson Hills.

104
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.360
This is actually a screenshot of the different missions opportunity.

105
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.120
There you can see 12 opportunities for local mission's involvement.

106
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.180
Uh,

107
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.680
we at Henderson Hills believe that our mission is to equip one another to love

108
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.120
Jesus and live sin.

109
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.440
So living sin means that we live in such a way to reveal the hope of Jesus

110
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.880
with others. As his ambassador, we, uh,

111
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.920
are reflecting his heart in the way we love.

112
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.920
We are sharing his gospel in the way we speak,

113
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.760
and we take intentional actions to love nonbelievers and literally

114
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.760
get involved in their lives to do life with them. When we do that,

115
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.920
we're showing nonbelievers the hospitality of Jesus.

116
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.240
And our mission focuses both on local missions efforts and on global

117
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.680
missions opportunities. Think about this for a second.

118
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.240
What if your community group decided to, uh,

119
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.160
to take on a global mission trip that you decided as a community group to go to

120
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.720
Nicaragua together, or maybe to go to Morocco or, or to go somewhere where, uh,

121
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.600
you can work with our missions department to discover the destination?

122
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:12.840
What if you, uh,

123
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.760
helped one another by collecting one another's funds in order to send those who

124
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.510
can go?

125
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.400
What an amazing opportunity it would be to come back and share the story about

126
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.680
how God had used them to take his gospel to the nations. Well,

127
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.440
each of these in these ministries, uh, any community group,

128
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.760
can literally make a, a,

129
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.880
a very powerful significant impact just by offering your time and your

130
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.360
skills and your compassions to support these ministries. And so,

131
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.840
whether you are mentoring at risk youth or teaching English lessons,

132
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.520
or providing essential resources or needs, uh,

133
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.480
or just simply being a friend to someone who needs a friend,

134
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.320
your community group can play a vital role in helping these ministries

135
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.680
fulfill their purpose and serve their communities effectively. One more thing,

136
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.360
and that is I wanna talk to you about a process for encouraging Microgroup

137
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.080
involvement. Now,

138
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.000
a very significant part of the role of the mission's discipleship coordinator is

139
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.600
to encourage micro group involvement. And what that means is that, uh,

140
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:19.680
that that leader discerns that it's time to pursue a deeper

141
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.320
approach to discipleship.

142
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.280
What you're doing as a community group is discipleship,

143
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.560
but the leader of a discipleship coordination, this,

144
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.240
they have this vision for establishing a disciple making micro group within the

145
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.240
community group. And they make that a priority,

146
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.400
both a men's micro group and a women's micro group,

147
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.680
or multiple men's or multiple women's micro groups.

148
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.320
They understand that disciple making micro,

149
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.000
micro groups are the optimal environment for nurturing and equipping disciples.

150
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.600
Now, a micro group is a gender-based group,

151
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.240
and it's called a micro group because it's just got three to five participants.

152
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.143
Four is perfect,

153
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.520
and they provide an ideal setting for intimate spiritual growth. Uh,

154
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.440
look at what involves in a micro group. First of all,

155
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.880
there's increased intimacy.

156
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.160
A smaller gender-based group just naturally fosters deeper connections,

157
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:13.200
and it allows for more profound spiritual discussions and a greater sense of

158
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.040
belonging when you're gone from a group of four people miss you. Number two,

159
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.920
transparency and even vulnerability. In a close-knit setting,

160
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.200
individuals of micro groups are more comfortable about opening up about their

161
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.160
struggles and their doubts and celebrating their joys and their blessings.

162
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.440
And this vulnerability leads to authentic spiritual growth through

163
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.440
accountability. Uh, there's also a greater responsibility. Uh,

164
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.080
few are members with, uh,

165
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.040
each participant plays a more significant role in the group's discussion and

166
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.280
activities. Like I said, when they're gone, they're missed.

167
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.680
And so that kind of promotes a,

168
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.480
a greater sense of personal responsibility for assisting one another in the

169
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.160
spiritual journey. And then lastly, accountability.

170
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.040
Accountability is the cornerstone of discipleship.

171
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.840
Micro groups provide a built-in system for members to hold one another

172
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.440
accountable in their walk with Christ and seeing one another transforming into

173
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.480
his image. So, uh,

174
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.000
by leading your community group in the implementation of establishing disciple

175
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
making micro groups,

176
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.760
you'll be fostering an environment where discipling relationships are nurtured

177
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.560
and can flourish. This is relational disciple making.

178
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.520
Now I'm gonna ask you to fight the temptation to only repeat old

179
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.840
patterns. Uh,

180
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.360
many Christian education patterns evaluate spiritual maturity by

181
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.320
attendance and retention of knowledge. Now,

182
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.320
there is value in attendance and retention of knowledge,

183
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.480
but disciples seek transformation in addition to to

184
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.320
attendance and transformation of knowledge.

185
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.480
Old pattern Christian education strategies revolve around Bible study classes

186
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.920
and theological education. And again,

187
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.960
there's value in bible study classes and in theological education.

188
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.480
But disciples seek in addition to obedience and

189
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.120
accountability in addition to that formal training. So these old patterns, uh,

190
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.560
for every one of us, they're deeply entrenched in our minds. And, uh,

191
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.840
we have to learn the to,

192
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.560
to resist the temptation just to fall back into those patterns because, uh,

193
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.680
the future of micro groups is promising.

194
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.920
If together we will hunger for more of Jesus with a genuine

195
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.720
high interest in spiritual things,

196
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.600
then micro groups will come together and grow in Christ and literally change

197
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.520
the environment of the community group,

198
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.240
the discipleship and community ministry staff.

199
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.880
That would be me and those in the office.

200
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.120
We are more than willing to support you in any way possible to make this vision

201
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.393
a reality.

202
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.400
We're willing and able to organize meetings and to facilitate training and to

203
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.880
help with logistics. We're gonna do whatever we can to help you encourage micro

204
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:53.740
Group involvement.

205
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.320
So please consider just the immense potential that disciple making micro groups

206
00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.600
have for your community group. Uh,

207
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.480
they represent a chance to deepen faith.

208
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.360
They represent a chance to strengthen relational bonds,

209
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.520
and they are probably our very best opportunity for creating

210
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.720
relationships that make disciples. You,

211
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.520
as the missions and discipleship coordinator,

212
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.280
serve as a catalyst to start new groups. The, uh,

213
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.080
mission coordinator encourages new disciple making micro groups in the following

214
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.960
ways. There are five regularly highlight and communicate the

215
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.560
church's vision to becoming a disciple making hub.

216
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.840
Do you talk about that in your community group?

217
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.000
You as a leader will be the one to be bringing that up. Number two,

218
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:44.320
celebrate people in your group that are involved in micro groups. Currently,

219
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.960
we have about 30 adult community, uh,

220
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.520
micro groups that are meeting off campus during different times of the week.

221
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.440
If you have someone in your community group, ask them about that,

222
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.640
give them an opportunity to share about that. Celebrate the fact that this is a,

223
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.520
a great thing that they're doing because what you celebrate, you replicate.

224
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.880
And we're working at replicating more micro groups. And number three,

225
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.360
you coordinate micro groups participants to share stories about their micro

226
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.280
group involvement. Uh, maybe, uh,

227
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.160
give a time before or after your prayer time to, uh,

228
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.600
share stories and testimonies about what God is doing in your micro groups.

229
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.880
And number four, you encourage existing relationships.

230
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.680
This is probably the most important thing in, uh,

231
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.760
encouraging micro group involvement.

232
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.520
You encourage existing relationships to become intentional about starting

233
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.880
disciple making micro groups. Uh,

234
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.680
what's amazing about our community groups is there are strong relationships

235
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.080
already in place. Uh,

236
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.800
but what we're doing is to ask those relationships to lever their trust of one

237
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.180
another,

238
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.680
to start to start a disciple making micro group where they can begin to become a

239
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.680
little bit more transparent, where they can become accountable to one another.

240
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.000
They can share responsibility for spiritual growth. And lastly, uh,

241
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.760
I want you to be able to inform your, uh, community group about our webpage.

242
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.480
And that is hhbc.com/disciple.

243
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.280
There you can go and say, I want to be discipled, or I want to make disciples.

244
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.020
And lastly,

245
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.760
you can give an update about the micro groups that are started in your community

246
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.640
group. I know that this is a very,

247
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.760
very important role and I know that there are a lot of community groups that

248
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.040
don't have someone in this, in this, um, in this role.

249
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.800
But I wanna encourage you that if you can, uh,

250
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.840
leverage the relationships in your community group and you can see those

251
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.920
relationships deepen and, uh, and and literally be, uh,

252
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.280
the asset that causes them to grow spiritually, uh,

253
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.240
it's gonna change your community group for the better and for the glory of God.
