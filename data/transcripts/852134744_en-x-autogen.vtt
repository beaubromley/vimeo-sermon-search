1
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.230
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.440
It's great to be together as we encourage one another,

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.920
as we spur one of the on to love and good deeds through singing, through giving,

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.400
through fellowshipping together and through giving

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.120
in all the ways that we'll talk about today. Now,

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.400
you are not just a spectator here today. Uh, you are never just a spectator.

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.000
You are an active key participant and we're gonna see that very clearly today in

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.600
the book of First Corinthians.

9
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.960
So go ahead and turn there with me if you have your copy. God's word,

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.800
first Corinthians chapter 12. It's where we're going to be

11
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.760
and it's easy to find an illustration for today because it's all over

12
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.320
this passage. Uh, threaded throughout is the illustration of the human body.

13
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.720
And the human body is an amazing machine, isn't it?

14
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.360
There are at least 11 distinct systems and

15
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.920
thousands of body parts that have to work together in order for the body to work

16
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.210
and function properly and we'll.

17
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.410
We all understand when we really think about it,

18
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.290
how important and how interdependent each part of the body actually is.

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.610
Like the lungs need the heart to pump the oxygen to all the parts of the body.

20
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.970
The the stomach needs teeth to grind up the,

21
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.890
the food and the esophagus to carry it to the stomach and other

22
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.170
parts to eliminate it, right? Like you see the, the stomach needs other things.

23
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.170
And before you think any part of your body is unimportant,

24
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.250
just wait until your gallbladder goes bad, right? Or,

25
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.210
or you see that your thyroids go haywire or you stub your little toe.

26
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.210
Even the infamous appendix

27
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.970
probably functions as some sort of probiotic storage unit. But anyway,

28
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.090
we can get into that later. Ask a doctor about it.

29
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.610
But if we understand the implications of our physical bodies and how

30
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.810
each part is important, how interdependent each part is on the others,

31
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.370
why don't we see that clearly spiritually?

32
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.840
One Corinthians 1227 says that you, that's a plural. You,

33
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.120
you together are the body of Christ and individually members

34
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.600
of it. See,

35
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.420
that's why I feel like all this is so important today because every one of us

36
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.780
is tempted by our consumeristic self-centered culture

37
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.220
to live our lives as if we were a cutoff body part

38
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.770
that we're just a liver lying alone on a table somewhere where we're a

39
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.490
finger cutoff or as Ryan said last year, we're an eyeball in a fridge.

40
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.330
Like thi this is what we are tempted to live like.

41
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.330
And that's obviously true of you if you never or rarely attend,

42
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.120
if you're never around other believers just in the presence and worship and

43
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.920
community, that's true of you cut off. But listen,

44
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.040
you can still be here all the time and still live a cutoff life.

45
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.210
You might pridefully think that you can make it on your own,

46
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.150
but the Bible actually commands us to serve one another with

47
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.680
the gifts that God has given us. One Peter four 10 says,

48
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.880
as each has received a gift, use it to serve one another.

49
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.900
Like you can't get any more clear than that. In fact,

50
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.900
Ephesians four further says,

51
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.980
that's actually how we grow as a church,

52
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.740
both ourselves and others, but also the church as a whole,

53
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.100
as we each use our gifts.

54
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.580
This is what Ephesians four verses 15 and 16 says,

55
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.940
speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him.

56
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.860
Who is the head into Christ? From whom?

57
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.460
The whole body that's us joined and held together by every joint with which it's

58
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.740
equipped, when each part is working properly,

59
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.580
makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.

60
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.290
So that's the truth today. Really simple. I need to grow.

61
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.530
You need to grow. So use your gift.

62
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.840
And if you remember nothing else, it's simple. I need to grow. You need to grow.

63
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.440
So use your gift.

64
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.400
That's how the Apostle Paul started this section in one Corinthians 12.

65
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.880
He's talking further about what we call spiritual gifts.

66
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.840
Ephesians four earlier explained that those come from God and

67
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.760
Paul's explaining to the Corinthians what those things are about.

68
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.510
And so as we're thinking about the fact that we all need to use our gifts,

69
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.790
the the summary of this first section in first Corinthians 12 is that God

70
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.110
uniquely gifts in equal ways,

71
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.600
God uniquely gifts in equal ways.

72
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.140
I'm wanna read verses four through 11 of one Corinthians 12 to start with where

73
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.070
we'll see that that truth I just said. Verse four,

74
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.950
there are varieties of gifts, but the same spirit,

75
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.950
there are varieties of service, but the same Lord,

76
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.950
there are varieties of activities,

77
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.790
but it's the same God who empowers them all in everyone.

78
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.560
To each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good,

79
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.510
for to one is given through the spirit, the utterance of wisdom and to another,

80
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.710
the utterance of knowledge according to the same spirit,

81
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.190
to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the one

82
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.110
spirit to another, the working of miracles to another, prophecy to another,

83
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.230
the ability to distinguish between spirits to another,

84
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.470
various kinds of tongues to another, the interpretation of tongues.

85
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.560
All these verse 11,

86
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.560
all these are empowered by one and the same spirit who

87
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.600
apportions to each one individually as he wills.

88
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.600
Now there are nine unique gifts listed in this little section here, but,

89
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.613
but know that this,

90
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.520
this list is not exhaustive 'cause there are actually other lists a couple

91
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.040
different times in the New Testament.

92
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.680
And so some would actually identify over 30 unique

93
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.160
spiritual gifts throughout the New Testament,

94
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.500
adding in things like teaching mercy, evangelism, administration,

95
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.060
even craftsmanship. You can kinda make an argument for that.

96
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.780
There's a number of other things that we would claim to be spiritual gifts,

97
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.740
really could be anything that God gives to you to use for his glory. I mean,

98
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.060
you could see that as in a sense, a spiritual gift as well.

99
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.753
But here's the point,

100
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.630
the point I want you to see is that our gifts are very different, right?

101
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.190
The first thing here is that our gifts are all very different.

102
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.870
It says there are varieties of gifts in verse four.

103
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.230
Even the ways they play out is different. Even the way God uses them, it,

104
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.830
it is all very different in how it shows up.

105
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.330
Yet they're all from the same God.

106
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.980
Did you see how many times from the same spirit, verse four says the Spirit,

107
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.260
the Lord in verse five, God gives it in verse six.

108
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.860
So this is all from God with one purpose.

109
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.460
That's why there should be no division over the gifts within the church.

110
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.620
That was a problem in Corinth.

111
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.740
Paul's talking to a church that had problems over dividing over the spiritual

112
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.420
gifts and he says, no, no, it shouldn't be that way. In fact,

113
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.740
this pretty plainly states that each gift is equally important, right?

114
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.780
Our gifts are very different,

115
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.680
but our gifts are just as important as one another's 'cause. Again,

116
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:56.820
over and over,

117
00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.680
the same spirit dishes out the gifts to each member

118
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.880
individually. Verse 11 said, as he wills,

119
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.760
like this is his call,

120
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.480
it's up to him as he wills and his gifting is part of

121
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.350
what scripture calls his grace to you. In fact,

122
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.830
that word grace has the same root word as gift

123
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.200
and, and scripture ties those things together. We talk about God's grace to us.

124
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.440
This is actually part of it. Like in one Peter four 10,

125
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.120
as each has received a gift,

126
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.560
use it to serve one another as good stewards of God's varied grace.

127
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.330
Same thing first, uh, Ephesians four, seven says, God's spiritual gifts,

128
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.190
his people,

129
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.970
but grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift,

130
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.060
Romans 12, six,

131
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.480
having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us,

132
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.210
let us use them. So this is God's gift.

133
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.490
His grace to you is that you have a unique gift from

134
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.460
him to use in God's gracious plan

135
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.650
as part of his grace towards you,

136
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.690
he's created you and designed you and gifted you with what you need to

137
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.250
fulfill his plan for your life.

138
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.870
You don't have to wonder if he's given you what you need.

139
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.110
He's given it to you by his grace. Now,

140
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.910
we don't know why he does some for this gift and some for this. That's his deal.

141
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.830
You can debate with him, take it up there.

142
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.430
But verse seven, notice what it says

143
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.650
to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good,

144
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.140
it's for the common good.

145
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.650
That means every believer to each, every believer has been given a,

146
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:57.450
a unique way for the Holy Spirit to show off within

147
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:58.303
the local church.

148
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.070
A way that verse seven says is for the common good,

149
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.710
each gift is for the common good. It's not anything meant to build yourself up,

150
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.880
it's meant for others. Remember each Ephesians four said,

151
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.080
when each part is working properly, that's when we all grow.

152
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.110
This is for the good of the body. The tendency, though,

153
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.390
the tendency in the church is for us to place more of an emphasis on the very

154
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.870
public gifts like teaching or pastoring. That that alone,

155
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.950
that is, that is what causes the church to grow.

156
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.130
But this says no, this says,

157
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.370
whatever gift you've been given is just as important as anything else

158
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.430
is for the growth of this body. So use it.

159
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:59.190
So use it. But you might be thinking something like this, okay,

160
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.070
I I hear you. I, I get, I should be, but, but, but,

161
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.550
but I've never been to seminary. Like I don't, I don't,

162
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.030
I don't have the training that I need to, to do what I'm supposed to do.

163
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.710
I don't know if I could serve like those other people serve when I see them

164
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.270
serving, I, I don't know if I could.

165
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.390
That's why this last piece here is so important that our gifts are all

166
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.920
empowered. Our gifts are very different.

167
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.400
Your gift is just as important as mine is, but they're all empowered.

168
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.280
You see it very clearly. Look at verse six again.

169
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.190
There are varieties of activities,

170
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.350
but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone.

171
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.170
And then down in verse 11, again,

172
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.330
all these gifts are empowered by one in the same spirit,

173
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.290
right? These, these words empower. So, so check this out.

174
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.880
God distributes these gifts as he sees fit. That's up to him.

175
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.360
But he doesn't just leave us hanging to figure out how to do 'em.

176
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.120
And we don't have to figure it out on our own how we can make this work and make

177
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.120
that happen. No, he empowers them. When we do it in our own strength,

178
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.440
we're gonna fail. When we lean on his strength,

179
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.520
we grow and the body grows in Christ's likeness.

180
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.060
I love how the apostle Paul said it in Colossians chapter one,

181
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.340
verses 28 and 29. This is a passage we're gonna get to in a few weeks.

182
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.260
We're gonna start working through Colossians next Sunday,

183
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.100
all the way through the end of the fall. But verses 28 and 29 of Colossians one,

184
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.300
this is very clear. Paul says him, we proclaim Jesus.

185
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.900
We proclaim warning everyone,

186
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.460
teaching everyone with all wisdom that we may present,

187
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.820
everyone mature in Christ. Remember, that's the goal of Ephesians four,

188
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.540
the body to grow in Christ's likeness. Verse 29, for this,

189
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.660
I toil that word is like, man, I'm working as hard as I can,

190
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:59.050
struggling with all his energy that

191
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.050
he powerfully works within me.

192
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.870
Is that not a profound shift? Like he's saying, I'm Morgan as hard as I can,

193
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.770
but this, this word he says that he his power,

194
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.770
it's the same word we saw in one Corinthians 12,

195
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.330
empowering the gifts that God himself says,

196
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.530
here's how you do it. Here's the strength to do it.

197
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.600
And so I know it might feel like a struggle.

198
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.200
Some of you've been serving a long time, you feel like it's a grind,

199
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.800
it's a long haul.

200
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.910
But some of you might be on the other side of this saying, I,

201
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.950
I don't know if I could ever do that.

202
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.870
I don't know if I could start serving in any way. Listen this,

203
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.670
if we rely on him, it's God's strength who gives you what you need to do,

204
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.503
what he's called you to do.

205
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.760
The only way you can do what you're called to do is by his strength that he

206
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.320
powerfully works within you. Paul said in Colossians one,

207
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.060
so God uniquely gifts in equal ways,

208
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.300
and then he empowers those gifts for the common good.

209
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.360
And so Paul sets that up and then he shifts into this

210
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.030
illustration, says, here's what the spiritual gifts all mean.

211
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.190
Here's how it works. Then he,

212
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.750
he shows us visually with the body metaphor, what it looks like.

213
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.230
So he starts in verse 12 of one Corinthians 12, 12 and 13. Look at this.

214
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.590
He says four, which means he ties it to what he just said,

215
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:38.030
for just as the body is one and has many members

216
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.070
and all the members of the body, though many are one body.

217
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.150
So it is with Christ.

218
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.800
For in one spirit we were all baptized into one body, Jews or Greeks,

219
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.840
slaves or free and all were made to drink of one spirit.

220
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.570
Is that not beautiful language about unity?

221
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.840
Does it not show us how critical it is for very different people

222
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:12.140
to function like they are one body? And listen,

223
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.860
we're not talking about uniformity where everybody is exactly the same.

224
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.380
We're talking about unity in the midst of the diversity.

225
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.300
And that is what shows God off to the world.

226
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.990
I mean, Paul here talks about Jews and Greeks, slaves and free,

227
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:32.300
those were historic enemies, had nothing to do with each other.

228
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.220
And he says, no, actually they've been brought together as one.

229
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.100
Ephesians two is a beautiful picture of that.

230
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:45.120
Here's how it's been said recently that the most dynamic evangelistic power

231
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:49.920
of the gospel comes when the world is forced to sit up and take notice

232
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:54.600
that people are loving each other in ways it cannot account for with humanistic

233
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.480
presuppositions.

234
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.940
Meaning the world has to look at this and say there's no reasonable explanation

235
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.100
for that. That those people would love each other

236
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.960
like different ethnic groups and single parent families and multi parent

237
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.600
families. And, and then you've got, you've got this, this dynamic of,

238
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.680
of rich and poor and,

239
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.240
and you've got people who are really high up in the world and lowly in the world

240
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.880
like and they all love each other.

241
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.210
That doesn't make sense to the world. But that's what the point here is,

242
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.590
is that God diversely saves into one body.

243
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.250
Like there is a wide range of people in this room right now,

244
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.973
all different.

245
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:50.040
And yet he saves into one body through

246
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.320
faith in Jesus' life, death and resurrection. That's the unifier

247
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.920
and the ceiling of the Holy Spirit.

248
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.040
That's what he's talking about the end of verse 13.

249
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.740
If you have believed turn from your sin, turn to Jesus,

250
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.460
that means you are saved into this one body,

251
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.060
Jesus's body in

252
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.830
the midst of that beautiful diversity.

253
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.390
There's a beautiful equality in that. There's one purpose.

254
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.890
Then we're not just saved as a smattering of people all sitting around together.

255
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.930
We're saved as one body with Christ as the head for one purpose to

256
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.930
follow what our head would say to do

257
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.720
altogether E equally.

258
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.260
So what that means first is that you are important.

259
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.530
That means you are important.

260
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.960
And I'm talking when I point my finger at this one person right here,

261
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.620
all of you, you are important. If there's unity within this body,

262
00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.513
you are important.

263
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.890
And so Paul takes this body metaphor and he shows us that a very clear and kind

264
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:10.090
of humorous way. Look at verse 14 through 20,

265
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.000
for the body does not consist of one member, but of many.

266
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.040
If the foot should say, because I'm not a hand, I don't belong to the body,

267
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.680
well that would not make it any less a part of the body, right?

268
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.810
If the ear should say, because I'm not an eye, I don't belong to the body,

269
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.900
I would not make it any less a part of the body because if the whole body were

270
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.360
an eye, where would be the sense of hearing if the whole body were an ear,

271
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.760
where would be the sense of smell. But as it is,

272
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.200
God arranged the members in the body, each one of them as he chose.

273
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.280
If all were a single member,

274
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.000
where would the body be as it is?

275
00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.520
There are many parts, yet one body.

276
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.800
So you remember in the first section, he's,

277
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.360
he's willing which gift people get here,

278
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.760
he has chosen how the body is arranged. That's what Paul is explaining,

279
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.950
his spiritual gift teaching with this body metaphor. He says, God picked it,

280
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.310
God assign. Now again, you could sit there and you could debate with God.

281
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.950
You could lament why you're not gifted to preach or why you're not gifted

282
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.590
musically or why you're not gifted like that person. You could do all of that.

283
00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:27.843
But see, this

284
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.940
you friend are critically important to the body with what you've been

285
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.250
given every one of you.

286
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.430
'cause listen, according to what he just said,

287
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.910
we're not just one big mouth chattering away like those windup teeth that kind

288
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.550
of go on the table, right? It's not a, it's not the body

289
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.480
or man, some of you remember this movie Fly to the Navigator way back eighties,

290
00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.360
nineties, somewhere in there like the eye that floats in, right?

291
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.240
We're not just one big eye looking at the world like this is the body together.

292
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.473
And think about it.

293
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:15.470
The hand cannot fulfill its complete function without the arm and the shoulder

294
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.670
and the heart beating blood to it. And the, the nerves signaling where to go.

295
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.310
Like the, the hand cannot do what it does without the body.

296
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.950
The mouth cannot speak without the lungs forcing air through vocal cords.

297
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.470
And you see, like you could go all the way into this,

298
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:35.950
the ears can't hear any further unless the feet get them somewhere else to

299
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.390
hear that bird chirping over them.

300
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.880
Just because you're not gifted in one way or another,

301
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:47.000
that does not mean you are a less important part of the body to

302
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.840
God designed the body this way.

303
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.620
Listen, that's why celebrity should never be a part of the church

304
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.340
since no one person has all the spiritual gifts. It's not about one person.

305
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.720
We need one another and we are all vitally important

306
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.560
because here's what happens when everybody's serving,

307
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.000
when each one is working properly, Ephesians four,

308
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.960
it allows each person then to pull back and say, okay,

309
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.480
what is my unique gift?

310
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.720
And focus on that and do that exclusively when everybody else is doing what

311
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.553
they're supposed to be doing.

312
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.740
It allows you to be better at what you've been called to do in Ephesians four,

313
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.620
that's how we grow into Christ's likeness.

314
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.490
So how do you use your gift? Okay, you see, I need to, I need to do this,

315
00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.600
all right, how do I do it first Again, remember, it's in God's strength,

316
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.800
it's empowered by God. You can't just go do this yourself.

317
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.080
You rest in the Lord for his power.

318
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.320
But I do wanna give you a couple practical examples of how you can serve,

319
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.760
how you can do what God's called you to do.

320
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.280
We're gonna put a slide up on the screen.

321
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.480
You're gonna see this and it's gonna be a lot of information really quickly,

322
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.960
but I want to just caveat something.

323
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.120
You might think that in a big church like this,

324
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.710
all the opportunities are filled. If there's not a place for you,

325
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.030
it's all easily filled up because there's so many people around. Well,

326
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.430
not so fast, my friend, as Lee Corso would say,

327
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.840
there are lots of ways to plug in and serve here.

328
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.130
It's just a sample list. By the way, we didn't pull everything.

329
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.170
We just open spots in a few different areas.

330
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:37.330
And so I'll just walk through some of this.

331
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:42.240
Maybe you're administratively gifted and you can help organize events

332
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.960
for our foster and adoption ministry that's growing right now,

333
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.120
or special needs ministry that needs help or,

334
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.720
or connections to help people feel included into our church.

335
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.080
Really anything could use administrative help, right?

336
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:58.320
Maybe you're musically gifted and you can help lead worship on Sundays and other

337
00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.240
times for us,

338
00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.450
maybe you're gifted with hospitality and you can be a greeter and you can make

339
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.570
people feel warm and welcome just by showing up.

340
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.010
Or you can serve on our care team to make sure people feel connected and cared

341
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.863
for and loved.

342
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.900
Maybe you're a gifted teacher and you can help lead a a community group or you

343
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.700
can help lead a a kid's group on Sundays or Wednesdays.

344
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.070
Maybe you're gifted with craftsmanship and you can help

345
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.830
take care of the building. You can be build some needed resources around here.

346
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.430
And listen,

347
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.960
some of this stuff is not necessarily because you have the gift to do it,

348
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.600
it's just because it's a way for you to serve others. Listen,

349
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.860
there is is no spiritual gift of baby holding, okay? Right there.

350
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.500
You don't have to have a spiritual gift to to do that, right?

351
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:54.980
But you know what that does?

352
00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.220
That serves that young parent who can be in here knowing their baby's taken care

353
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.040
of back there and they can focus, right? So,

354
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.480
so that's just a way to serve your brothers and sisters around you and care for

355
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.250
people in that here's an added benefit.

356
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:14.570
Serving is also one of the best ways to feel more connected to the church.

357
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:21.220
You know, lifeway Research just did a study, it was pretty piercing.

358
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:26.500
They, they surveyed church attenders all across the country

359
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.720
and 84% of people said that their church encouraged them to serve.

360
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.360
But only 30% had served anywhere in the last year.

361
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.390
And so we wonder why we feel so disconnected from the church.

362
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:44.390
The best way is when you get to serve with people and you're right alongside 'em

363
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.830
on a mission trip where you're serving in kids or in the cafe or anything else.

364
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.710
You just get to be, and my ours might be higher. I don't know.

365
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.350
Ours might be lower, I don't know. But anyway, there's,

366
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:58.070
there's a whole lot of disconnected and spiritually stunted people in the

367
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.790
churches in America because this is part of the deal.

368
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.770
I'll, but I also want you to hear me in this.

369
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.250
There are many ways for you to serve with your gift that are

370
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:16.680
unseen, that don't have a title, don't have a position.

371
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:24.270
Think of the gift of wisdom to be able to speak into somebody's life in a

372
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.990
disciple making relationship that's not up there.

373
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:29.973
But how needed

374
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.650
or the gift of mercy where every Sunday you walk in these doors and your

375
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.370
mind is to look for people, you're scanning the room and you're asking, God,

376
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.250
who do you want me to sit by today? Who do you, who do you want to lead me to?

377
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.730
Who needs somebody to care for 'em right now?

378
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.460
Because it might be their last chance at church.

379
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.540
And they show up and they're like, God, if you don't move today, I'm out.

380
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.380
And it could be you to sit next to them and be that reconnection point.

381
00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.040
That's the gift of mercy. It's not up there. But, but just live with that.

382
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.360
The gift of faith. Like just think of the,

383
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.560
the list of widows and widowers that I send a letter to every Monday.

384
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.040
The gift of faith that they have to just battle in prayer for me,

385
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.630
for our family and for the church. You don't see that,

386
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:25.080
but it's a gift. And we could go on and on and on. But to each remember,

387
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.360
to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good,

388
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.890
for the body's growth.

389
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.930
Even if it's behind the scenes and nobody even knows you're doing it.

390
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.330
It's for the good of the body. We are many parts.

391
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.010
Yet one body,

392
00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:46.490
see church culture in America is so consumeristic

393
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.090
like, what's in it for me? What do I get out of this?

394
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:58.830
If I don't like what I'm receiving, I'm gonna go somewhere else, right?

395
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.470
It's just, it's all about me. It's all about what I get out of this. No,

396
00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.390
the picture here is of service to others.

397
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.710
Like you show up because you're like, how can I care for other people?

398
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.950
How can I serve other people today?

399
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.600
Use your gift.

400
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.570
You are important to this.

401
00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:25.950
But also remember this.

402
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.340
That means they are valuable too.

403
00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.473
You are important,

404
00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:41.080
but that also means they meaning everybody else around you are valuable too.

405
00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:47.050
We are to cherish these other parts around us.

406
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.490
See, Paul continues with this metaphor verses 21 through 26.

407
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.500
He says, the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you,

408
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.500
nor again the head to the feet. I have no need of you.

409
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.230
On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker,

410
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.910
are indispensable.

411
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:14.450
And on those parts of the body that we think less honorable,

412
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.210
we bestow the greater honor.

413
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.610
And our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,

414
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.250
which our more presentable parts do not require.

415
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.540
But God has so composed the body,

416
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.460
giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,

417
00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.220
that there may be no division in the body,

418
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.710
but that the members may have the same care for one another.

419
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.870
If one member suffers, all suffer together.

420
00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:45.110
If one member is honored, all rejoice together.

421
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.500
And so again, each gift is very different. Each part is very distinct,

422
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.500
but everyone is just as important to the function of the body as anyone else's.

423
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.340
He in fact used the word indispensable.

424
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.970
That means no one can be excluded.

425
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:10.530
In fact,

426
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:15.450
what we discover here is a highlighting of those parts that might seem less

427
00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.930
worthy, that might feel like they're less honorable,

428
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.610
that might feel less important. Paul says no. In fact,

429
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:24.490
we should highlight and encourage them because there's no division here.

430
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.570
We're all on the same team. It's not just about the few of us who are public,

431
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.850
right? This is a universal team. One body,

432
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.460
God wants us to have a mutual concern for others simply because

433
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.360
that person is also Gods.

434
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.240
Not because of what they can or can't do. That doesn't matter.

435
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:49.480
It's that that's God's person, that's a member of our body,

436
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.600
that is God's image bearer. And we care for them.

437
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.080
In fact, I love the picture.

438
00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.800
Verse 26 paints here of the interconnectedness of the body.

439
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.640
Like when you get a scalp massage, your whole body enjoys that, right?

440
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.280
Like the tingle you get. It's just, this is great.

441
00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.760
So every every part is rejoicing with the one who's honored. But but also,

442
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.160
you know it's true. When you break your arm,

443
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:24.190
your whole body suffers because of it, right? It's limited,

444
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.150
it hurts with the arm. And I think, listen,

445
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:33.030
I think this is one huge area where we have missed it in the local church,

446
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.460
in the, the modern church has missed this.

447
00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.300
'cause one of the most common things that we hear,

448
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:47.990
one of the most common themes we hear when talking with people in crisis

449
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.380
is that they feel alone.

450
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.330
That no one is with them.

451
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.910
Now listen, they might have a bunch of people around them.

452
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:07.890
They might be sitting by a lot of people on Sundays.

453
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.290
They might have a lot of people around them in their neighborhoods,

454
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.410
but they feel alone.

455
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.610
One Corinthians 12 says, we're interconnected though,

456
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:29.420
that we're not just a bunch of disconnected body parts sitting near one another

457
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.090
in a room. We are interconnected.

458
00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.010
And so think about this.

459
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:42.870
Do we even know when other members are suffering?

460
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.920
Do we even care that other people are hurting?

461
00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.453
It

462
00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.730
doesn't seem like it because we sure walk around like everything's fine.

463
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.030
How you doing? I'm fine. How you doing? I'm good.

464
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.940
It can't happen here. We,

465
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.700
we have to make sure that no one feels alone.

466
00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.440
We have to make sure that we, we have a, a culture,

467
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.840
an atmosphere that allows people to get real, to get vulnerable and say,

468
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.240
I'm not okay. Like how you doing? Pretty terrible right now.

469
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.930
And you actually say, okay, well let's talk through it.

470
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.210
Instead of just looking at 'em like they're crazy and walking away.

471
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.720
Because one Corinthians 12 indicates suffering together

472
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.400
is more than just walking with someone through that issue.

473
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:49.120
Like how often have you heard or said, Hey, I'll be there if you need me.

474
00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:55.120
If you need anything, let me know. How often do you get called?

475
00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:01.350
Rarely, right? Because it doesn't really seem like care, but,

476
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:06.430
but this says no, we need to enter into it with them. That's the idea.

477
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.510
Suffering with them. They suffer together.

478
00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.950
That means you're actually in it with them.

479
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.550
I love the phrase I hear from firefighters. Firefighters say it this way,

480
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.450
when others run out, we run in.

481
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.570
Should that not be true of the church? Everybody's abandoning,

482
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.370
everybody's leaving and saying, no, I don't wanna deal with that.

483
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.730
That's too hard. We run in and care.

484
00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.230
Like just this Tuesday at our staff meeting,

485
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.400
a church staff meeting,

486
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:43.240
we had more than a few staff members open up very vulnerably about

487
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.920
deep struggles and pain in their life.

488
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.000
Cancer feelings of depression,

489
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.100
friends dying. They don't know what to say.

490
00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.870
And listen, I love the fact that there's,

491
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:05.270
there's a culture of freedom that says it's okay for me to say that

492
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:09.740
I'm struggling right now, that I'm not okay,

493
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:14.260
that I need help. That that's okay on a staff, a church staff.

494
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.540
And we can say, listen, I'm struggling with this right now.

495
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.820
I don't know what to do. I don't have the answer.

496
00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:22.020
It's hard to believe God right now. Like that's what we're saying.

497
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.780
And so what we did is we gathered around them,

498
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.900
we prayed over 'em and and we just suffered with them.

499
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:32.270
We carried those needs to the Lord and we, we shed tears together.

500
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:33.670
It was incredibly sweet.

501
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.220
Now the challenge will be continuing that ministry for the long haul.

502
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.900
Not just once and forget about it, but actually carrying for it.

503
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.900
But here's the reality.

504
00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.100
If I'm too busy to sit with someone in pain,

505
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.850
then I'm too busy, period. Right?

506
00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:58.690
If you're too busy to care for someone in need, you're too busy.

507
00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:01.920
What's more important?

508
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:09.230
It's the heart of the gospel, right? Jesus who,

509
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.110
who came not to be served but to serve.

510
00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:15.470
He ran into our pain when everybody else ran out.

511
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.750
He carried our sin on the cross.

512
00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:23.240
He suffered with us. This is the heart of the gospel.

513
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.300
So when was the last time that you entered into a brother's or sister's pain?

514
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.150
Not just that, I'll pray for you, but entered feeling it with them.

515
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.480
You felt the abuse they endured in some way

516
00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.050
you hurt with their pain over a loss.

517
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.080
Listen, some parts of the body may not be very public. No,

518
00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.040
but they are worthy of honor too.

519
00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:04.120
This is a way to honor because God designed them for a vitally important

520
00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.520
aspect of the body's function. If they're hurting, we should hurt with them.

521
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.200
And it may just be what they provide for the body,

522
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.960
just the faith to endure really hard things

523
00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.790
like it's so life-giving,

524
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:27.710
encouraging to me when I know many stories in this room and I look out here and

525
00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:32.350
I'm preaching about trusting God and I'm watching people who've trusted God

526
00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:34.190
through way harder stuff I've ever faced.

527
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:38.550
And they're still believing and raising their hands and crying and saying,

528
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.630
Jesus, you're my everything.

529
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.980
That's the gift of faith that builds me up.

530
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:52.250
So, so encouraging. And so let's shift our focus away from ourselves,

531
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:59.010
consumerism and it's about me and shift it on to those people around

532
00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.843
us.

533
00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.690
'cause we finally get to verse 27 here,

534
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:10.180
which is a great summary of everything that I've said today.

535
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.460
I said at the beginning, but verse 27 says,

536
00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.420
now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.

537
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:22.200
This is who we are, church.

538
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:28.800
We are a local and expression of the

539
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.440
global and eternal body of Christ.

540
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.660
And as we've seen, we have every gift and we have every part.

541
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.300
We need to fulfill the purpose that God has ordained for this body.

542
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.260
We can't do everything. We shouldn't try to do everything,

543
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.140
but we can do what God's called us to do.

544
00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.230
That means we can go on the mission that he uniquely has for us.

545
00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:02.670
We can grow as he intended for us to grow.

546
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.840
And we can care for people as he intended us to care for people.

547
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.000
We have everything.

548
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.340
We have everything we need to do.

549
00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:21.100
What Jesus' physical body would've been doing while he was here on this earth.

550
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.690
We are the body of Christ. Now,

551
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.960
what was Jesus doing? We do

552
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:41.370
only though, remember only if each part is working properly.

553
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.730
It's been said that in a land still heavily influenced by a heritage of

554
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.090
rugged individualism,

555
00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.810
believers need to work ever harder to demonstrate that Christianity is not a

556
00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:03.210
merely personal religion, but is fundamentally corporate.

557
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:10.840
What that means is that it is absolutely a personal relationship with

558
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.673
Jesus,

559
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:18.150
but it must lead to interpersonal relationships with other Christians.

560
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.290
This is part of what it is.

561
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:27.330
You are the body of Christ and individually members of it.

562
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.970
But when we do that, listen, one of our values is reimagine generosity.

563
00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.770
When we rethink how we give with our lives,

564
00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.850
when we walk in here as an investor, not a consumer,

565
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.610
when we live our entire lives all week, looking out for others,

566
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.610
caring for others, when that's what we are doing, listen,

567
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.490
that's when we are all blessed, right?

568
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:57.030
Is that not a blessing? Would that kind of church not be a blessing,

569
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:02.770
a blessing to us? Each one of us? We'd all benefit from that.

570
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:05.410
But then think of the blessing. It would be to the world

571
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:12.230
because your neighbor, my neighbor, is looking for hope.

572
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:16.870
My neighbor's looking for value. Our neighbors are looking for connection.

573
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:22.710
And what they would see is a true faith family empowered to live

574
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:27.660
out what Jesus has commanded. What a blessing.

575
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.410
So we rely on God's spirit for his power.

576
00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.540
But church, let's be that. Let's be that kind of church, right?

577
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:41.580
What a blessing.
