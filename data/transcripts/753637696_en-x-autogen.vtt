WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.000
So let me just tell you what the schedule is then so tonight

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.200
we have two main sessions session one

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.800
is about to happen. Then

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.900
we're going to take a break and then we'll be session two and then

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.900
tomorrow will be session three and

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.200
then after session three we will have some breakout.

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.900
So let me just tell you what the topics of

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.500
each session is tonight's first

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000
session is called why do we marry?

10
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.900
Followed by what happened to us? And then

11
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.300
tomorrow the good one is how do

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.100
we reconnect? So that's kind of

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.700
the plan for the weekend.

14
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.100
Yeah, and as me and my colleagues have been talking. I'm by

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.200
the way, I'm Mason Phillips. I'm the counseling

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.000
director over at ministries of Jesus. If you have no idea who I am.

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.500
You probably don't but we've been talking a lot about what

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.300
marriage is need right now. And what we've noticed

19
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.400
is that people want to be together and when the

20
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.300
going gets rough, they just don't really know how to

21
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.700
make that stay together. So make sense.

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.200
I'm sure we'll learn that it makes

23
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.100
sense as we go on this weekend. So my

24
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.700
name is Jimmy Quinn and I work here at Henderson

25
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.000
Hills and I work with our marriage Ministry. And

26
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.600
so that's why I'm here. But as Mason

27
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.500
and I have been thinking about this weekend.

28
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.700
From a church point of view some of

29
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700
the things that I've seen maybe you guys are like me.

30
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.400
When I was in college, it seemed like

31
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.200
everyone around me was like getting a girlfriend and then

32
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.400
like getting engaged and then they get married like

33
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.500
man. Everyone around me is getting married. And then

34
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.100
of course I get married and then everyone

35
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.300
around me a couple years later like there's something

36
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.800
in the water like there's pregnancies everywhere babies everywhere

37
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
and then I have a baby and now I have two kids girls

38
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.600
and you know just seems like that's what it is.

39
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.500
Well now I'm in this stage of life where

40
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.300
it's like man my friends are having

41
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.700
some marriage problems and it just seems like everywhere. I

42
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.600
turn there's like not just a little

43
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.500
bit of rocks and

44
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.700
bumpy roads, but like Boulders and

45
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.200
so I just have a heart for that and and I

46
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.000
just want like marriages to like sustain and and

47
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.200
to to stay together because I

48
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.600
think in scripture we see that the marriage

49
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.200
relationship is depiction of our relationship

50
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.000
with our Lord. So

51
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.300
Marriages need help and most of

52
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.700
all as we'll talk about this weekend is they need Jesus and

53
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.600
maybe even a good therapist would help

54
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.500
as well and we have one here tonight. His name

55
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.400
is Larry Roberts. He's a good friend of mine. I've known

56
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.600
him a long time. He also has been a great mentor to

57
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.100
me in my life. As I was becoming a therapist. I learned

58
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.800
a whole lot from him whether that's good or bad. He'll tell you and so

59
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.800
You know, he loves Jesus. He loves

60
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.400
to see marriages come together and follow

61
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.600
Christ and so before

62
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.100
He comes up here though. He's going to talk a

63
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.100
lot about a lot of different topics. And we want to

64
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.200
make sure that he answers all your questions. But in case he doesn't we want

65
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.200
you to have a way to ask some of those questions. So we've got a

66
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.500
QR code on screen. If you were to pull your phone out right this second

67
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.200
and hover your camera over that like you do on

68
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.000
the menu during the pandemic at the restaurant. You know,

69
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.200
that can't same kind of deal. You should be able to pull up a form.

70
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.300
It's very simple form and

71
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.100
you can just submit your questions there and we'll be looking at those throughout the

72
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.000
conference synthesizing them together seeing any commonalities

73
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.300
and hopefully we'll answer some

74
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.000
of those questions throughout the course of the weekend, so

75
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.200
And this code by the way when it

76
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.200
goes away, we've got them on tables out in the lobbies and things

77
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.300
like that. So Jimmy, do you want to pray for

78
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.200
us? Yeah before I pray for us. There was another

79
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.200
thing that I wanted to mention, you know, when you go and get

80
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.200
an oil change for your car most of the time

81
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.200
you don't see like

82
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.800
that it actually did anything, you know, it's like

83
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.000
oil you you don't really tell that it actually

84
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.000
worked but you know, you're supposed to get an oil change because if you don't

85
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.600
You know damage might happen to your vehicle. And so

86
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.700
tonight your marriage might be awesome and

87
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.000
you might be like, hey, I'm just gonna go to

88
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.400
Please my husband please my wife but this is

89
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.600
maybe as preventative maintenance for you is what

90
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.500
I'm saying, or maybe you might have some real.

91
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.100
Struggles, it's okay. No matter where you are

92
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.500
on the Spectrum. We hope that you will glean something from that and we

93
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.000
want to equip you and Mason and

94
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.600
Larry want to equip you to do marriage. Well,

95
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.100
so let me pray for us as we

96
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.100
as we go and sometimes I

97
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.800
do some premarital counseling and the first thing that I say to

98
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.200
to these couples is marriages the

99
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.000
second most important relationship you have

100
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.600
The first of which is your relationship with Jesus and so

101
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.800
as we just consider marriages in general,

102
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.600
I think it would be wise of

103
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.600
us just to to remind you of the Gospel

104
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.400
remind you that if it weren't for

105
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.600
Jesus paying the death for your sin, we would

106
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.700
not have that freedom that

107
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.600
Liberation from our sin. And so I

108
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.600
want to read First Corinthians 15 for us.

109
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.300
It is the gospel message. It says

110
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.300
this Paul's writing says I remind you brothers that the

111
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.300
gospel I preach to you which you received and which you stand

112
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.300
and by which you're being saved. If you hold fast to

113
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.800
the word I preach to you unless you believe in vain for I've

114
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.000
delivered to you that of a first importance what

115
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.600
I receive that Christ died for your sins

116
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.300
according to the scripture then he appeared to

117
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.600
see us in the 12 then he appeared to more than 500 brothers

118
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.200
and he raised on the third day according to

119
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.400
scriptures. So that is the gospel that Christ died for your sin.

120
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.700
So that you could be reunited with him and that's the second or

121
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.100
that's the first.

122
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.200
Most important relationship you can have and then the

123
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.100
second is your marriage which we'll talk about this weekend. We pray with

124
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.200
me.

125
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.400
Lord as we open up your word and we as we

126
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.100
listen to to Larry speak to us tonight God I

127
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.000
pray for marriages in this room. I pray

128
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.600
that you strengthen that you equipped that you Empower

129
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.300
husbands and you and support and

130
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.400
comfort wives.

131
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.500
And all across the board.

132
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.600
Just to do marriage well to be a representation

133
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.200
of your love for your

134
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.500
breath.

135
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.100
We love you father. It's in your name. We pray amen.

136
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.400
Let's welcome Larry Roberts, my friend.

137
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.700
Okay.

138
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.600
Can you hear me? Okay. All right, good. I can hear myself.

139
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.500
All right. Well good evening and welcome.

140
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.600
I'm just gonna tell you one. I hope I don't fall off the stage.

141
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.300
I'm not there. I'm not a I'm not a speaker.

142
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.300
I'm not a teacher. I'm a therapist. It's my that's my full-time

143
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.800
job. And so this kind of thing here is terrifying and

144
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.100
this is like there's a lot of people here.

145
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.200
Like I thought 12 jurors was

146
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.500
scary.

147
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.800
Holy cow to be standing up here thinking that.

148
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.000
All these people are judging you, right? That's that's just kind of

149
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.400
scary for me.

150
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.200
So bear with me we'll get through this and we'll get

151
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.500
to go home in a little bit.

152
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.800
All right. I really am glad you're here. I'm truly truly

153
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.000
honored that you're here. And I'm

154
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.700
excited to be here. I do love talking about marriage and

155
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.600
trying to help couples have the

156
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.300
marriage that they want. But first I just

157
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.800
want to share with you my family. They

158
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.500
are my my

159
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.400
inspiration. They're my life and I

160
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.900
love them so much. So the first

161
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.100
one in the middle, obviously, that's my wife Candice. We

162
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.600
met at OBU and August of

163
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.600
1989 met the night before classes started there.

164
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.300
And she was a freshman. She was just going to date and

165
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.400
she was gonna have a good time. She was a Minister's kid and lo and

166
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.200
behold she met this guy from

167
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.100
Ardmore and she didn't have

168
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.900
a chance after that.

169
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.500
So she she had one. She's made

170
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.500
one terrible decision in 31 years, and she's still

171
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.000
paying for it.

172
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.700
Right now so so that's her our family

173
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.200
is a little complicated, but he didn't

174
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.100
start out that way.

175
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.100
It really didn't start out that way at all. It started out Simply enough

176
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:52.500
with Ashley Ashley's up in the upper left-hand Corner up there our little

177
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.300
our little girl. She was our first one we had in college. Well, she

178
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.300
grew up met Quinn at OBU. They moved to Colorado.

179
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.700
They got married. That's him there in the bottom left and and

180
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.300
they live in Colorado because you

181
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.400
can snowboard there and they're never coming home. So

182
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.900
they're never coming home to Oklahoma.

183
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.600
They'll come to visit but they're not coming home to stay.

184
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.000
Later on, we had Nathan in the

185
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.300
upper, right? He was our

186
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.300
second kid and then we were finished after that. We didn't want

187
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.100
to have any that right because it's easy to go to a restaurant and sit with

188
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.300
four people and if you go to like six flags and

189
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.400
everybody can ride I grew up in a family of five. And

190
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.800
so somebody always set out. I don't want to do that. So we after after

191
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.600
the two kids we were like we're done we're done. And so

192
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.200
Nathan we had him we were finished. He grew

193
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.700
up married his middle school sweetheart Taylor. They've been

194
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.800
married about four years now, but been together like oh like

195
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.100
11 12 years like that's crazy.

196
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.300
So our life was great up until I

197
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.900
was easy not complicated right? We're it

198
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.600
was just very simple.

199
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.200
Then when Ashley was in the eighth grade and Nathan was in the fifth grade

200
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.100
we brought on two more

201
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.100
kids.

202
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.500
Miranda and Veronica. They're at the top Miranda's on

203
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.500
the left and Veronica's on the right. And yes, you see four. You're not seeing double

204
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.200
a few a few

205
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.700
months after that.

206
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.300
After we took them we learned that they had a full blood

207
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:19.800
baby sister.

208
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.600
There was just a couple months old and so we brought

209
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.200
her on in August of '07

210
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.300
on their second birthday. So

211
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.000
Well now we have.

212
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.300
Five kids just like that. We have five kids. It was

213
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.200
like Walmart in our little house. It was like everybody bumping into one another.

214
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.800
We just putting people wherever we could fit them, but it

215
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.100
was okay.

216
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.200
So then life goes on we kind of go through our lives and navigate our

217
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.500
kind of fun but complicated life as best we can raising the

218
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:46.600
girls.

219
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.300
And then a few years in we learned. Oh, they

220
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.400
have another full blood baby sister that we didn't

221
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.100
we didn't know about we got to meet her once and then she

222
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.500
kind of went away for a few years.

223
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.400
Well, long story short two years ago a little

224
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.700
over two years ago. We learned that she

225
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.600
was not in a good place.

226
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.400
And so we we went got her

227
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.800
and we got guardianship of her and we've

228
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.000
had her now for a little

229
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.400
over two years. And so that's her on the bottom right that she's Trisha. She's

230
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.000
13. So my twins are 17 Leah is 15 and

231
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.200
Tricia is 13.

232
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.500
So there's boxes at the back. You can drop your donations

233
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.500
in we helpful. You can venmo cash

234
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.700
app. Whatever you got. You can just make Candice's right here drop her

235
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.800
some money. We need all help we can we can get. Okay.

236
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.700
So here's a little bit about me. I don't

237
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.000
like that when I turn around see the back of my head. I don't like that. Here's

238
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.600
a little bit about me. I graduated from OBU

239
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.900
the second time in 2003. I

240
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.200
don't know why I decided to go back to school. I barely got

241
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.800
through the first time.

242
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.200
I don't know why they took me back. I don't have any idea but I

243
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.500
went back got a master's degree in marriage and family therapy in 2003 2005.

244
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.400
I got my license 2006. I

245
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.400
started a private practice by myself because I really just

246
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.100
wanted to work on my own.

247
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.100
2008 I moved in with a partner and

248
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.300
he and I started just working together. And then

249
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.600
in 2013, we grabbed another partner and we started the

250
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.400
center for Christian Counseling in care there in Shawnee.

251
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.100
And as of today, there's eight of us there. There's seven

252
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.100
full-time therapists and and then we have an

253
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.400
intern or a she's a licensed

254
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.300
candidate. So we have we have

255
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.800
eight total.

256
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.100
In 2014. I was invited to come and

257
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.200
teach at OBU in the marriage

258
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.500
of family therapy department. I thought oh, this is great. I can go back and do that.

259
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.400
And so I started that and I did that for eight

260
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.200
semesters eight fall semesters. And so

261
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.200
I'm not teaching this year. I stepped away from that because I really just

262
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.200
wanted to focus on couples.

263
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.300
I really just wanted to work with them and kind

264
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.500
of really narrow my Lane of work down to just working

265
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.300
with couples and and kind of moving this other stuff away.

266
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.100
It was fun. I really enjoyed that. It's where I'm at

267
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.200
Mason that's where I've met a lot of therapists and

268
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.300
They have that was really enriching for me. I enjoyed that

269
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.100
part, but I just needed to move on and focus on

270
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.200
what I wanted to do.

271
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.400
During the during the pandemic though.

272
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.700
We we kind of learned and maybe

273
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.100
some of you learned that work was a

274
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.900
big buffer for couples.

275
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.400
Right, they really didn't know how

276
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.200
emotionally disconnected they

277
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.900
were until they were home all the time.

278
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.600
and their kids were with them all the time and it

279
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.600
Kind of became like metal on metal for them and they started

280
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.100
showing up in my office

281
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.400
and calling and just in droves they

282
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.300
started showing up and so it's it was at that

283
00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.400
point. I was like, I really narrowed my focus just to work on couples because

284
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.700
there's a lot of great individual therapists out

285
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.200
there. But what I was learning was that there was not a lot

286
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.600
of good marital therapy.

287
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.600
And so and I think I I'm a good marital therapist.

288
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.400
And so it's like I just want to focus on that and give more people

289
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.200
the opportunity to do that. So so that's

290
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.500
a little bit about

291
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.300
About me so let's get started. First

292
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.200
thing I want to say is I don't know if anybody staff here whatever

293
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.100
but I see a lot of people doing this it might be a little

294
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.700
warm and so I don't know if there's an air conditioner in the building or

295
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.400
what maybe the

296
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.700
Bill's not pay, I don't know.

297
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.600
Tithe people whatever you can

298
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.300
do to help out. Like I

299
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.500
said, I'm incredibly honored that you're here.

300
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.700
And and I pray that you're

301
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.400
here to take your marriage to a place that you never thought

302
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:49.900
possible.

303
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.200
And listen, it may sound like a

304
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.200
preacher story may sound like something out of a Preacher story

305
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.000
or maybe even make me sound like a snake oil salesman. If any of your

306
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.500
old enough to remember what that was, but the

307
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.300
reality is it's possible. It is possible in

308
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.600
the time that we have this this weekend tonight and

309
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.800
tomorrow put your marriage on the right

310
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.700
track. So I hope you're going to be willing to

311
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.000
take even a small risk.

312
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.000
Right in kind of

313
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.400
being vulnerable and being able to just to engage with your spouse. I'm

314
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.100
not going to ask you to engage with other people around you. I'm not going

315
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.000
to do that. But just with your spouse, I'm going to

316
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.100
ask that you take some of these small risks just to be able to

317
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.100
be as more open as or as open

318
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.400
as you possibly can and maybe help bring you guys a little bit closer

319
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.000
together.

320
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.400
Okay. So the first session tonight, I

321
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.400
want us to consider this one main question and that

322
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.300
is why did we get married?

323
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.500
Why do we get married though? I don't know for sure. My guess

324
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:50.700
is

325
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.500
Most of you in here are married.

326
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.100
I mean as I'm kind of looking around the room I see

327
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.400
there's a lot of couples maybe some

328
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.300
of you are preparing for marriage. That's that's a good

329
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.300
place to be as well. So what I what I

330
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.600
do know for sure is that I'm not a researcher.

331
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.500
I don't know actually how many people get

332
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.400
married and I really don't know what to believe about

333
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.900
divorce statistics.

334
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.400
Right. I just don't what I do

335
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.300
know is that when people is

336
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.800
that a lot of people still get married?

337
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.000
The majority of people on the planet still get married. They

338
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.900
want to be with somebody right? And so

339
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.300
they all get married with the hope that they're gonna

340
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.700
stay together for a lifetime, right? I mean imagine going to that wedding that

341
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.200
they don't they're not planting on being together for

342
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:42.700
a lifetime.

343
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.000
Kind of scary to be at that wedding, I think.

344
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.200
so

345
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.200
let me just say this as I do know, they

346
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.400
get married many people get married.

347
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.300
And they want to stay that way but some things happen along

348
00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:58.600
the way.

349
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.400
And it kind of make a second guess our decisions.

350
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.000
I know Candice and I early on in our marriage we've had that you've probably

351
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.400
had that maybe you've never had that and that's

352
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:09.800
okay, too.

353
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.000
But this is when problems begin to arise early

354
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.200
on.

355
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.200
Right spouses began. We kind of look at each other differently, right

356
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.200
then we once did.

357
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.600
I'm going to discuss this more in

358
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.500
our second session tonight. We talk about what happened to us.

359
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.200
And and then tomorrow we will kind of talk about

360
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:29.900
how to get out of this.

361
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.300
When we with with

362
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.500
as we answer the question, how do we reconnect? How do

363
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.300
we reconnect with each other?

364
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.200
So that's a simple enough plan. And so what I do want to say is that listen

365
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:41.500
I

366
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.900
I don't expect that everybody in here is in

367
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.000
trouble.

368
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.800
I know some of you and I don't expect that you're in trouble. I expect

369
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.400
maybe this is just a date night for you.

370
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.900
And you just want to go and spend some time doing this together Candice

371
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.500
and I we're gonna go to marriage conference at

372
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.100
our church Emmanuel Baptist Church in Shawnee. We're going

373
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.300
to go that next weekend.

374
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.100
We're not in trouble.

375
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.100
At least I know I might be in trouble. I don't

376
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.100
know but but we

377
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.400
want to go just because it's a good thing to do to spend

378
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.500
some time together and learn something and you may learn something. You

379
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.200
may learn nothing. If in reality

380
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.200
you just come here and you spend the weekend with your spouse and you have a great time

381
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.600
and you reconnect on something something touches you

382
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.700
man. That's great. That's a win so

383
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.500
They're probably are some people in here who's struggling.

384
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.000
And who are not sure and who are reaching out and this can

385
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.600
help you too. Okay?

386
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.400
So tonight I want to I want to tell you I want to start by telling

387
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.100
you just one.

388
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.900
Simple truth. I do like to keep things simple.

389
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.700
One simple truth and that is there is one enemy.

390
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.200
in your life

391
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.900
and it is not the person sitting beside you.

392
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.600
Right, it's not him. It's not her.

393
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.600
It's the enemy is the the

394
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.800
devil right Satan.

395
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.500
It is this force in this world that

396
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.400
seeks to destroy all the good blessings that

397
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.100
God has given us and its first

398
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.200
Target.

399
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.400
Is your marriage?

400
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.600
We're going to talk about that from the moment Adam and

401
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.100
Eve were in the garden together.

402
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.100
The enemy sought to separate them from God and

403
00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.500
then to separate them from one another.

404
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.700
He did it then.

405
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:39.800
He's doing it today.

406
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.700
and my prayer for you and my life's work is

407
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.000
that

408
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.300
We help that. I help couples recognize this

409
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.900
terribly destructive cycle and how

410
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.500
to stop it from destroying this.

411
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.500
Good blessing.

412
00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.300
That God has given us.

413
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.200
Okay.

414
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.000
So every couple gets married kind of

415
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.400
with the belief that their marriage will last until

416
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.700
death do they part? But but as we all know and and maybe

417
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.600
some of you have experience, it doesn't always work

418
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.000
out that way.

419
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.700
Right in the in the dance of marriage. Sometimes we

420
00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.200
step on each other's toes, right? You probably had your

421
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.700
toes stepped on before and it hurts, right? It's not always very

422
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.200
fun when that happens.

423
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.600
It's then that our culture comes along and it

424
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.300
says well, you must not

425
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.000
been compatible with that person.

426
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.200
Or he was a narcissist.

427
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.600
Or there's somebody better out there for you.

428
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800
right, that's

429
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.200
It's at that point. We kind of developed a belief. Well, maybe

430
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.300
marriage isn't for everybody. Maybe it wasn't for me.

431
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.000
And and then kind of life kind of falls apart for us.

432
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.500
It's too difficult at times and so and

433
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.600
then it kind of leads to misery.

434
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.300
But the reality is especially as Believers, we

435
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.400
know nothing could be further from the truth. It wasn't

436
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.300
designed to be that way.

437
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.400
We all know mayor just tough. Right we've experienced that and I knew during

438
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.600
tough times people. I want to get out of it. That makes sense

439
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.400
that sometimes they want to find something better or someone better.

440
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.300
But also know that people will do anything they can.

441
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.100
to save their marriage

442
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:26.700
But why?

443
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.000
Why do they want to save something? That is the source of

444
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.200
such misery? Why do they want to save something? That's

445
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.100
Challenging or difficult or tough at

446
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.900
times. Why would they want to why do they want to do that?

447
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.100
Why why go to all the trouble?

448
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.600
Why go to I mean, why do they go by these marriage

449
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.700
books marriage help books? Why do they go to counseling? Why

450
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.400
do they go to conferences or seminars workshops where everyone

451
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.500
calls us? Why do they do those things?

452
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:55.800
right

453
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.800
It's for the same reason that we go to our kids ball games.

454
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.200
Is for the same reason that we go to cheer competitions?

455
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.400
To my girls are cheerleaders. They're cheering right now. Right we go

456
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.300
to cheer competitions. They do those things we go to dance what

457
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.500
we don't go to dance recitals that are not at night think the Lord that's expensive.

458
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.400
You're probably a part of that but you do those

459
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.500
things why or even go to you don't even go to these activities

460
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.300
with your spouse that you don't particularly enjoy for 30 years.

461
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.400
I played competitive Racquetball and I would go into these

462
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.000
tournaments and in play and Candice went to some of

463
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.400
them not to all of them because she didn't enjoy it.

464
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.700
But us does so she went I went

465
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.200
to a ballet or something with her one time. I don't

466
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.500
enjoy that but us does so we go right

467
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.900
marriage conferences. Maybe you don't enjoy that but us does so

468
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.300
you go.

469
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:46.600
right

470
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.700
we go because we love our kids we go because we

471
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.500
love each other and we want to show them by supporting

472
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.200
them, right? This is this is why

473
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.900
spouses fight so hard to keep

474
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.400
their marriages alive because they simply love each

475
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.700
other. That's why I don't know that's good.

476
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.800
And they want what their marriage was supposed to be?

477
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.100
They want what their marriage was designed to be

478
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.200
and we all know what that was It was supposed to be incredible right

479
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.300
if we go back and we're gonna go back and look at the Garden here

480
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.000
in a minute as we go back and look at that. It was supposed to be incredible.

481
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.000
It was supposed to be loving.

482
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.600
It was designed to be warm and peaceful and intimate it

483
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.500
was designed for us to be spiritually and emotionally

484
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.400
and physically connected to each other.

485
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.500
for a lifetime

486
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.400
That's the way it was designed.

487
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.200
But many couples I see.

488
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.500
Come to me because they have lost this

489
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:43.800
connection.

490
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.400
And they are lonely in a house with someone

491
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.700
they love and they don't have any idea why.

492
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.100
Since we were designed to be in a relationship.

493
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.700
The opposite of that is that we were not designed to be

494
00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.100
alone.

495
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.000
I know this is true in my own life. Candice is with

496
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.800
me. I don't like it, you know.

497
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.300
I'm a golfer. I go play I go like golf trips

498
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.900
with my buddies and those are fun.

499
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.700
But I miss her she goes on her trips

500
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.100
with her with her girlfriends and I like that

501
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:16.500
she does that.

502
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.100
But it's lonely. I miss her.

503
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.500
We weren't designed to be alone and God even said in his

504
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:23.700
word.

505
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.400
That it was that it was not good for man

506
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:27.700
to be alone.

507
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.700
So listen to Genesis to 18 to 28.

508
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.200
If you want to turn in your put it

509
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.900
on your phones, you can you can pull it up, but you can just listen just these 10

510
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.000
verses.

511
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.400
Then the Lord God said it's not good that man

512
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.600
should be alone. See I told you that's what he said.

513
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.000
I will make him a helper fit for him.

514
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.300
Now out of the ground the Lord had formed every beast of

515
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.000
the field and every bird of the heavens and he brought them to the man to see

516
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.300
what he would call them and whatever the man called every living

517
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.400
creature. That was its name. So let me stop first

518
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:01.500
again.

519
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.100
It's not good for man to be alone.

520
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.000
So God said he would make a Helper, but then God makes Adam

521
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.600
name all the animals.

522
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.400
That doesn't seem to make much sense.

523
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.100
I need to make a helper fit for him, but he doesn't make a helper fit

524
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.200
for him. It makes him a go name all the animals.

525
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.200
That makes sense. Okay, maybe just think let me

526
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:24.400
read on.

527
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.500
The man gave names to all the livestock into the birds of the heavens into

528
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.200
the every beast of the field, but for Adam there was not

529
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.400
found a helper for him.

530
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.800
a helper fit for him

531
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.700
So God made all the animals.

532
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.500
There was not one that looked like Adam.

533
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.600
What was he doing?

534
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.100
What was God doing with this?

535
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.700
Little bit just to be honest. It seems like a little bit of a cruel joke.

536
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:51.900
right

537
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.500
reading on so the Lord God caused the Deep Sleep to follow

538
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.100
man to fall upon the man and while he slept he took

539
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.500
one of his ribs and he close up his place with flesh and the rib that

540
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.500
the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and he

541
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.600
brought her to the man.

542
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.800
the man said hot dog

543
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.300
What husband wouldn't want to wake up next to his naked wife, right? I'm

544
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.000
kind of

545
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.200
okay, maybe you don't I don't know then the man

546
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.700
said this at last.

547
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.200
This at last is bone in my bone. And if you read it in

548
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.400
the Hebrew, that's exactly what he's saying hot dog.

549
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.600
I have somebody that looks like me.

550
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.000
I have somebody for me.

551
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.600
He says this at last his bone of my bone and Flesh

552
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.600
of My Flesh. She shall be called woman because she

553
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.200
was taken out of man. Therefore man. Shall

554
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.200
leave his father and his mother and hold fast to

555
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.900
his wife and they shall become one flesh and

556
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.500
the last but definitely not the least important verse

557
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.600
In this passage his verse 28 and the man and his

558
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.700
wife were both naked and they were not ashamed.

559
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.500
There was nothing between them.

560
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.400
Right, they didn't have fig leaves yet.

561
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.600
There was nothing but openness and transparency.

562
00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.200
and intimacy

563
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.900
the only piece of the garden experience that

564
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.800
was not good.

565
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.100
The only piece of in the creation story that

566
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.600
was not good was that man

567
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.300
was alone.

568
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.900
Let that sink in.

569
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.400
That's really really important.

570
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.900
As a therapist who deals in the world of emotions

571
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.100
more than most people.

572
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.200
I feel sad for Adam.

573
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.200
And if you really kind of think about that, I feel sad for out and my first

574
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.300
thought goes to how does he feel?

575
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.100
And so if we were to ask him Adam, how did it

576
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.700
feel if he could tell us he's going to give us a typical man response fine.

577
00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.600
Right. That's what he's going to say. I think he was fine in the beginning, right? He

578
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.100
had a purpose.

579
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.900
Namely animals he had some Authority.

580
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.800
And he got to use some creativity.

581
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.000
And there's probably all kinds of stories about why did he do that and a woman

582
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.100
wasn't there and you know in the man and he didn't want her there

583
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.600
or he would be doing it wrong. I just probably all kinds of jokes about that. But the

584
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.100
reality is he was there he had some purpose he

585
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.100
had some Authority he got to use some creativity and I'm

586
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.000
sure for a while it was great and I'm sure he would have said yeah, I was great.

587
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.000
But the more animals he named.

588
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.400
The more animals he named the more. I think he began

589
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.800
to realize to really important truths.

590
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:34.800
You ever thought about this?

591
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.000
There was two.

592
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.300
Of every one of them.

593
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.200
And not a single one of them looked like

594
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.500
him.

595
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.400
I always make the joke about that. Well that hairy back gorilla,

596
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.800
but she had somebody.

597
00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.100
Right. There was nobody for him.

598
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.500
Which really begs the question.

599
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.600
Why would God make Adam feel loneliness?

600
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.100
Without having anyone to help him.

601
00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.300
Why would God make him feel that loneliness without

602
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.400
anybody to support him?

603
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.200
Well, I think for two reasons.

604
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.200
I think this was for Adam to learn

605
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.700
to rely on God to supply all of his needs.

606
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:23.700
right

607
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.200
I think that's fair and the second one I think was

608
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.500
for Adam to experience life without human

609
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.100
interaction.

610
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.000
So that he could feel the loneliness.

611
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.500
To me the the emotional ramifications of

612
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.400
this are far-reaching and I think the

613
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.700
impact is profound.

614
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.400
Many people tend to focus on the solely

615
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.000
on the first point.

616
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.300
And they kind of minimize the second point the first point that was Adam was to

617
00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.200
rely on God's solely it meaning they ignore their

618
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.300
internal design for relationship.

619
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.100
And say we should only rely on God for for everything.

620
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.600
I'm not going to argue with that.

621
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.600
I think that's true and I don't think that can be denied

622
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:08.900
at all.

623
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.400
However, it can't be the only point of the text.

624
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.300
because if it was

625
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.100
If it was Adam God wouldn't have

626
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.300
he would have left that part out.

627
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.900
He would apart he would left out the part about needing a helper.

628
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.600
He designed them.

629
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:30.900
Yeah, so sorry.

630
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.300
He would have left out the part about being needing a

631
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.000
helper for Adam.

632
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.000
So we have to be mindful of both of these points because I

633
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.100
think they're both true.

634
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.600
And find in these find in both

635
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.200
of these and in the creation of Eve.

636
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.200
the heart of our loving father

637
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.700
So let's agree. It's all agree that God

638
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.200
created that God created

639
00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.500
Adam and he wants him to rely first and foremost wants all

640
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.200
of us to rely first and foremost on him to provide

641
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.600
all that we need right? It's a

642
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.600
Sole Provider for all that we need but also let's also

643
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.700
agree that he wanted Adam and Eve.

644
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.700
To have each other and that he designed them to need

645
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.200
each other as well. And if you think about this this is

646
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.400
I think is really important even needed Adam for protection.

647
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.300
And Adam needed Eve for support and

648
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.600
this is exactly where the enemy attacked

649
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:28.600
them.

650
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.800
So notice from the text that God didn't create the

651
00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.500
only the male animals.

652
00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.900
First and leave them to notice their loneliness.

653
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.700
Before he created them.

654
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.700
He created both of them at the same time and both

655
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.600
from the dirt.

656
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.200
But not Eve.

657
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.900
He didn't create Eve from the dirt.

658
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.700
I believe God would want I believe God wanted her today.

659
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.000
I believe God wanted her then. I believe God wanted her to

660
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.300
have a special place and Adam's life.

661
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.200
That's where I want to focus tonight and tomorrow.

662
00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.600
The place that we have in each other's lives.

663
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.700
Throughout our time together.

664
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.100
Tonight and tomorrow I'm gonna ask you to

665
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:16.700
talk to each other.

666
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.500
And kind of share any of the feelings that come up for you and he thoughts

667
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:25.400
that come up for you at certain points along the way these things

668
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.400
can be they're really boring. If you're just listening to

669
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.800
me or listening it just any one person.

670
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.600
So and I know it can be uncomfortable. It is

671
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.700
for me at times and undoubtedly,

672
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.300
there's some of you have not talked about much else than the weather or

673
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.600
work or kids and in you know,

674
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.200
quite a while.

675
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.800
But but please take this opportunity to just engage

676
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.500
with one another.

677
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.000
And give you your marriage an opportunity to

678
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.600
become what it was designed to be.

679
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.400
So this first exercise that I'm going

680
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.200
to ask you to do is I just want

681
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.500
to talk to each other for a minute a couple minutes about these

682
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.300
two questions. I think we have them on the screen. Yeah.

683
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.500
What do you think about God creating Eve from Adam and not

684
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.600
from the dirt? And how do you feel about God creating Adam and

685
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.700
letting him be alone for a while?

686
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.100
So if you would just turn to each other if you

687
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.200
want to spread out a little bit you can do that too, but just kind of just talk about

688
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.100
that for a minute while I get a drink

689
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.600
and just kind of talk about that.

690
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.000
for a few minutes

691
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.000
Okay.

692
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.400
So listen, I realize that exercise is like this kind of

693
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.400
sharing with each other at times can

694
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.200
be a little awkward.

695
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.300
I mean, I know it is for me at times, you know to be able to do that.

696
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.700
When I'm working with couples and I have them.

697
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.700
turn to one another and share with one another it they

698
00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.800
often their kind of fear response

699
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.800
shows up and

700
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.100
they start laughing. They don't want to look at each other.

701
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.500
They you know, it's it's just

702
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.600
it can be awkward at times.

703
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.200
what I look for and what I'm hoping you guys are

704
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:13.800
going to

705
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.900
take from it is an experience of being able to just turn

706
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.200
each other and talk to each other.

707
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.200
It's quite often that people as couples.

708
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:25.900
We just don't do that.

709
00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.700
And so I appreciate you doing that and we're going to be doing that some more.

710
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.600
tonight and tomorrow

711
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.200
So how does Genesis 2?

712
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.600
18 to 28

713
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.100
connect to the this main question. Why did we

714
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:44.600
get married?

715
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.800
I think it speaks very loudly and very

716
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.300
clearly to us.

717
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:56.200
About the nature of our divinely inspired internal

718
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.000
design.

719
00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.300
To be deeply connected to one person for a lifetime. You

720
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.500
guys have heard this about a one

721
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.100
flesh relationship.

722
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.400
Right. It's more than just physical spiritual. It's

723
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:09.900
emotional.

724
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.200
It's physical. It's all of that.

725
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.600
That's the way we were designed.

726
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.700
And I think it's the main reason the the overwhelming majority

727
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.100
of people still get married.

728
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.900
Even despite what they hear about marriage.

729
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.600
Or what they what they know about marriage themselves.

730
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.500
Dr. Sue Johnson she is a researcher. She's

731
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.600
a marital therapist. She's a founder of emotionally focused couples therapy.

732
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.700
She's in Canada. She says this

733
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.000
it's up on the screen.

734
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.900
Love is the continual search for a basic secure

735
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.700
bond with someone else.

736
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.400
Through this Bond spouses in love become emotionally

737
00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.300
dependent on each other for nurturing soothing.

738
00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.700
and protection

739
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.800
I think this statement perfectly correlates

740
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.800
with the passage in Genesis.

741
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:16.000
And it basically confirms that we have this divinely inspired

742
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.600
need for emotional connection.

743
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:20.900
from our spouses

744
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.600
So some of you have undoubtedly heard of

745
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.800
attachment Theory right heard of

746
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.200
attachment Theory but attachment theory. Yes,

747
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.700
it's an evolutionary theory, but

748
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.800
we know that that just means those theorists haven't

749
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.400
realized the or acknowledged

750
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.700
or admitted God's design in

751
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.300
all of this. Right. So if you ever hear Evolution just think

752
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.400
God's design. That's what as far as attachment Theory

753
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:48.600
goes

754
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.200
Attachment Theory basically says that our need for

755
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.900
this kind of connection this emotional powerful emotional

756
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.500
connection we have is a survival response.

757
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.500
Right. It's a it's the driving force of

758
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.000
the bond of security a child

759
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.700
seeks with its mother.

760
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.000
And this right the drive doesn't go away

761
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.800
when when we become adults.

762
00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.500
Have you ever been in your mom's? I know you have.

763
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.200
You've been in a bathroom right your kid, right? You've been

764
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.800
in the bathroom and the kid walks past dad and

765
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.900
finds you and knocks on the bathroom door, right Mom

766
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.500
Mom right trying

767
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.400
to get to you or knocks on the bedroom door night Mom, Dad,

768
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.800
whatever right? I can't get to you.

769
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.600
in those moments

770
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.100
how many of your kids go? Okay. Well, she's

771
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.200
probably busy. I'll just probably go back out here and wait.

772
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.100
For a few minutes and she'll come out and get

773
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.500
me or they'll come out when they're finished right doing taxes

774
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.000
or whatever. They're doing. They'll come out and

775
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.400
No, they don't do that. Right they

776
00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.200
Start banging and they start doing everything they can right and

777
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.900
what would happen if you didn't?

778
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.200
Come to them.

779
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.100
They start panicking.

780
00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.800
Right. That's the survival response coming

781
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.000
up.

782
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.100
Over a period of time if you never come to them it changes, right

783
00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.300
but this is what happens. This is what happens to

784
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:22.300
us. This is the survival response. This is why couples fight

785
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.900
It's our means of getting us.

786
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.900
It's a means of getting our spouse to see us.

787
00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.200
To draw close to us to come to us to show

788
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.600
up for us. It's our cry.

789
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.500
It's our cry so to speak but it's just

790
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.100
an adult version of our cry.

791
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:46.200
So I want to show you a video that demonstrates.

792
00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.200
Exactly what I'm talking about and some of you have probably

793
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.000
seen this before.

794
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.400
But it's it's called a still face video.

795
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:59.600
This was done. I think back in the maybe in the 90s. They've

796
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.200
read it's been done a couple of times

797
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.100
throughout the years, but this is it's just really interesting. So

798
00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.800
I want you to watch this.

799
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.700
Babies this young are extremely responsive

800
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.000
to the emotions

801
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.900
and the reactivity and the social interaction

802
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.800
that they get from the world around

803
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.500
them. This is something that we started studying.

804
00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.800
30 40 years ago when people didn't think

805
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.600
that infants could engage in

806
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.300
social interaction in this

807
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.400
still face experiment with the mother did was she sits

808
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.200
down and she's playing with her baby who's about a year

809
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:40.800
of age.

810
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.300
To the baby the baby gives a greeting back to her

811
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.300
this baby starts pointing at

812
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.500
different places in the world and the mothers trying to engage

813
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:59.600
her and play with her. They're working to coordinate their

814
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.600
emotions and their intentions

815
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.200
what they want to do in the world and that's

816
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.600
really what the baby is used to and then

817
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.500
we ask the mother.

818
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.100
To not respond to the baby.

819
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.300
The baby very quickly picks up on

820
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:22.100
this and then she uses all of her abilities to

821
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.700
try and get the mother back.

822
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.800
She smiles at the mother.

823
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.100
She points because she's used to the mother

824
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.700
looking where she points.

825
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.400
The baby puts both hands up in front

826
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.800
of her and says What's Happening Here?

827
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.700
She makes that.

828
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.400
Screechy sound at the mother like come

829
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.100
on. Why aren't we doing this?

830
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.400
Even in this two minutes when they don't

831
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.100
get the normal reaction.

832
00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.600
They react with negative emotions, they turn

833
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.400
away. They feel the stress of it. They actually

834
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.500
may lose control of their posture because of

835
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.500
the stress that

836
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:10.100
there

837
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.200
And what are you doing?

838
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.900
Oh, yes. Oh, would it be girl?

839
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.100
It's a little like The Good the Bad and the

840
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.500
Ugly the good.

841
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.600
Is that normal stuff that goes

842
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.500
on that we all do with our kids?

843
00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.100
The bed is when something bad

844
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.600
happens, but the infant can overcome it

845
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.300
after all when you stop the still face the

846
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.100
mother and the baby start to play again.

847
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.100
The ugly is when you don't

848
00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:51.400
give the child any chance to get back to the

849
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.700
good there's no reparation and

850
00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.800
they're stuck in that really ugly

851
00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.200
situation.

852
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.100
So anybody ever seen that before?

853
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.800
Isn't that interesting?

854
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.600
This is our design.

855
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:13.300
They were connected and then the baby instantly knew.

856
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.300
Something was wrong. Did you see that baby's face when Mom

857
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.500
turned around? I mean it's heartbreaking. It was like

858
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.600
Just the eyes cut and everything. It was

859
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.000
like it knew wait a minute Something's Happened.

860
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.900
in an instant

861
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.700
That baby knew something was wrong.

862
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.100
Something was happening. We do that too.

863
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.900
As adults we do that too.

864
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.100
Right, we're designed to have that kind of

865
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.600
emotional dependence.

866
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:42.900
on each other

867
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.400
so we got designed it. It's why God wanted Adam to be alone

868
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.700
in the garden for a little bit so he can figure this out. He needed

869
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.400
to drive this point home. We were designed to

870
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.300
be attached.

871
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.200
not separated

872
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.100
when this happens to us.

873
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.400
When we're not, you know, when our spouse isn't there

874
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.200
for us emotionally we cry.

875
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.600
Just doesn't look like this Baby's cry.

876
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.300
Our cry doesn't our cry to

877
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.300
to reconnect doesn't typically come

878
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.700
from a vulnerable place like this Baby's did right when

879
00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.400
we bake when our babies cry we oh we

880
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.200
go and pick them up that right that's reason that they said at the

881
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.500
end of that Mom's the baby's crying and so Mom.

882
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.800
swoop Center to reconnect

883
00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.800
cry to reconnect doesn't come from same place.

884
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.000
Comes from this. I mean it comes from this place

885
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.600
of I need you.

886
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.100
And without you I'm terrified.

887
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.400
So instead of our spouse coming to comfort us.

888
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.000
They kind of back off and defend themselves.

889
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.500
And so this is what I'm going to talk about later.

890
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.500
And in the second session tonight.

891
00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.500
Now I get that it might be difficult, especially in our culture.

892
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.700
It might be difficult to kind of see dependence as

893
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.900
something that's good as a good quality to have.

894
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.100
Right minions have been many of us

895
00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.200
have been taught over the years that dependence is bad.

896
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.400
The dependencies is an in

897
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.200
for males, especially that it's a form of weakness.

898
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.200
But if that's true then our dependence on God would be

899
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:19.500
bad.

900
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.000
And that's just not the way it is.

901
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.500
Being dependent on him being dependent on

902
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.100
God gives us our greatest sense of security.

903
00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:33.300
Right. We all know that is Believers gives us the greatest

904
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.500
sense of safety.

905
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.100
And since it's his design doesn't it make sense

906
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.600
that he would make us the same way to need our spouse

907
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.700
to be dependent on them emotionally and those

908
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.000
same ways.

909
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.500
To depend on each other for the emotional connection just as

910
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.400
our children depend on us for that to

911
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.400
depend on your spouse to respond to you when

912
00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.200
you need them.

913
00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.200
To depend on or to you

914
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.600
know to know that you matter to her.

915
00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.300
To know that he values you to know that she will be

916
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:05.900
there for you.

917
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.200
To know that he'll respond to your emotional needs.

918
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.000
the most basic belief of attachment theory

919
00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.900
is that

920
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.500
Isolation loneliness us being

921
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:19.700
alone.

922
00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.300
Is both physical and emotional

923
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.700
is traumatizing for us as human beings.

924
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:27.800
Do you remember?

925
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.900
Do you remember what the Lord told Gideon in judges

926
00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.100
6 15 and 16?

927
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.700
After Gideon asked him, how can I save Israel?

928
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.200
My clan is the weakest in Manassas, and

929
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.800
I'm the least of my father's household.

930
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.100
And the Lord said to him.

931
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.300
But I will be with you and you

932
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.000
shall strike down the midianites as one man.

933
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:54.500
right

934
00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.400
Well, you're a New Testament Church. Let me give you a maybe you don't know the

935
00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.600
Old Testament. Let me maybe go to the New Testament think about

936
00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:02.600
the word Emmanuel.

937
00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.300
Right. We all know what that means coming up on Christmas. We sing

938
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.200
about that. What does that mean? God With Us

939
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.200
right. We we know that

940
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.500
and remember what Jesus told the disciples in Matthew 28 19

941
00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:15.900
and 20.

942
00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.400
Right toward the end. He says go and make disciples of all Nations

943
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.300
baptizing them the name of the Father and Son the Holy Ghost teaching all

944
00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.300
that. I commit I obeyed teaching them

945
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.200
to obey everything that I have commanded. And then what does he say at

946
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:29.300
the end?

947
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.100
And remember I will always be with you.

948
00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.400
If Jesus would have said and remember.

949
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600
see boys in heaven

950
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.000
right

951
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.000
Christianity would have probably died out by the weekend.

952
00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.700
Right his presence with them

953
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.700
just as his presence with us.

954
00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.800
Gives us courage his presence gave them courage to

955
00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.800
go and to tell and to endure persecution

956
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.300
and even die for him,

957
00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:02.700
right?

958
00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.600
That's what his presence. Does Candace being here

959
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.600
with me tonight.

960
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.400
Gives me courage even if you guys decide halfway

961
00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.200
through this thing. You're gonna run me out on a rail.

962
00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.800
She's gonna comfort me all the way home.

963
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.400
She's with me.

964
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:20.900
She'll have me right.

965
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.100
Don't you see then how much sense it makes?

966
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.400
To marry someone to be with us. Yes. We

967
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.900
love them but man we want them with us.

968
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:34.800
Is why we get married.

969
00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.100
Through our Good Times through our bad times through the

970
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.900
through the joys through the Sorrows of life.

971
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.100
Someone with whom we can share our lives together.

972
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:46.800
That's why we get married.

973
00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:48.300
And so

974
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.400
for us to be alone is scary.

975
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.000
It's also why we will do anything.

976
00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.100
We can to reach for the safety of our

977
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:00.700
spouses.

978
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:03.900
the anything

979
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.600
is what I'm going to talk about in our

980
00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.000
next session

981
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.200
tonight. Okay. We'll talk about that. All right.

982
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.300
That's all I have for now for this piece. I think there's a oh Mason's

983
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.800
gonna come up and kind of tell us what we do now.

984
00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.200
We think Larry is really good. I was like

985
00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.900
So captivated I've known Larry a long time a

986
00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.100
lot of this. I haven't heard so I'm like, I'm really in Courtney and

987
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.500
I are like doing every exercise.

988
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.000
This is great.

989
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.300
So before we go to break Jimmy, do

990
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.300
you want to tell our friends what we've got for them? So

991
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.200
our goal one of the things that as we

992
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.700
began praying about this is if there's

993
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.100
really not much of a follow-up from this and it's

994
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.800
just like a night and a morning. We've

995
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.200
kind of failed you guys. So we asked some

996
00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:07.200
of our community friends to

997
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.600
come out and so we got a couple booths out

998
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.300
there and we really want to help with

999
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:16.400
the follow-up. And so if you have questions, there'll be

1000
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.600
partners out there to talk to about kind of

1001
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.600
what's next or things that you may have on

1002
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.300
your mind. Yeah. I'll tell you quickly who's out there

1003
00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:28.800
and I spent earlier part

1004
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.200
of the or later part of the winter going and

1005
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.100
meeting some of these folks and inviting them here and those

1006
00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.200
are legit counselors out there

1007
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.300
who may even be ready to set up an appointment with you.

1008
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.400
You need to get their card if you're thinking about going and talking

1009
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.700
to somebody they're out there and they love

1010
00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:47.000
Jesus.

1011
00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.400
You we made sure that the people we invited are people

1012
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.000
who trust God like we do also ministries

1013
