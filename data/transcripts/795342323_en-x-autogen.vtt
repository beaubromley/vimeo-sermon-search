1
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.600
Oh, the weather outside is frightful

2
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.400
his praise and worship and you didn't even ask.

3
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.800
But we're glad you're here if you're oh thank

4
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.100
you. Thank you didn't even

5
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.100
ask for Plaza either.

6
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.300
We're here. We missed one week.

7
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.100
Everybody's asking me is he going to be able

8
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.300
to fit all of this in three weeks and I said with

9
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.200
no trouble whatsoever and he won't skip anything.

10
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.300
Just kind of get it all in there. If you're a guest with us, we

11
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.400
want to say welcome and there's a cue card there and

12
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.100
we would love for you to QR code to scan that

13
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.100
in and let us know that you're here. I also want to

14
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.400
do invite you in three weeks. We're going to start a second

15
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.500
session another four week session and

16
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.700
it's called a my role in the culture wars

17
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.300
and we're going to be looking at some very extreme topics

18
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.400
that the church doesn't always look

19
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.300
at very closely and we'll be looking the very

20
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.200
first week at the our issue and as it

21
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.400
pertains to the lgbtq agenda and in the next week, we'll

22
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.700
be looking at our our role in the race relations issue.

23
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.300
We'll also be looking at climate change and what else

24
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.200
there's another thing and it's all about the same

25
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.700
kind of temperature. But anyway be in

26
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.700
prayer about that. It's going to be interesting information. We have

27
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.400
a Biblical world view. We don't have to shy but

28
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.300
I'll shy away or not not enter into

29
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.700
the exchange, but we do need to know that

30
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.300
God has given us a new king and a new kingdom and

31
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.000
a new agenda and how to respond to all those cultural issues.

32
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.700
And so that's coming up in not

33
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.300
next Wednesday, but the Wednesday after that we'll start

34
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.400
with my role in the court culture wars. Well, let

35
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.400
me start with a word of prayer and then we'll get started right away with Dr. Emerson.

36
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.800
Let's pray.

37
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.400
Father thank you so much for the opportunity to

38
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.200
meet together. We thank you Father that giving us a

39
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.400
warm place and a safe place to meet. Thank you for your word

40
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.400
and how it is a one story about how

41
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.700
you redeemed the the sin

42
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.700
in our lives and made us someone

43
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.200
that you can you can count on For Your Glory and

44
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.900
I just pray Lord that we would we would see the things

45
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.900
that we've not seen and how you're how your

46
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.600
scriptures all tied together around that beautiful Redemptive theme.

47
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.200
Thank you for Dr. Emerson for bringing him here with us. And

48
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.200
and we thank you for Jesus. Most of all, it's in his name.

49
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.200
We pray. Amen. Let's welcome Dr. Matthew Emerson.

50
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.900
Well glad to be back with y'all. I was disappointed not

51
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.300
to be able to come last week and was glad that

52
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.300
the roads are at least clear for another few hours so I

53
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.600
could come this week. So we've got

54
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.200
a lot to cover. I thought that I would

55
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.900
have some makeup time. Maybe if I needed it with a

56
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.600
fourth week, but we're gonna have to fly.

57
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.000
So last week we covered or two

58
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.200
weeks ago. We covered the first three chapters of the Old Testament.

59
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.500
Tonight we're going to cover the entire.

60
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.100
Old Testament from Genesis 4

61
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.700
to Malachi for so

62
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.400
as my friend Willie used to say in preaching class buckle up

63
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.200
because here we go.

64
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.300
Just really quick to review. We did

65
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.400
talk two weeks ago about the fact that in Genesis 1

66
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.400
God into God made

67
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.000
Adam and Eve to dwell with him forever

68
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.600
to glorify him and he gave them four tasks.

69
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.200
Do you remember what they were?

70
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.700
Dominion

71
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.400
obey

72
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.800
be fruitful multiply.

73
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.400
Care for God's place, right? So God made

74
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.000
Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply rule

75
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.500
over the Earth care for God's place and Obey

76
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.900
God's word.

77
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.500
Ultimately that was intended to fill the Earth

78
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.100
with other image bears.

79
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:48.700
of God

80
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.200
But instead of obeying Adam and Eve

81
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.600
sinned they failed to rule well by letting the

82
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.500
serpent into the garden and by letting him talk they fail

83
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.900
to obey.

84
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.500
and therefore

85
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.100
Sin, entered the world and affected the other

86
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.300
two tasks. They were going to have a hard time being fruitful and

87
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:07.600
multiplying.

88
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.200
God told Eve it's going to hurt for you to have babies. You're not

89
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.700
going to want to make babies and then it's gonna send effects

90
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.700
atom's ability to care for creation thorns

91
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.500
and thistles you'll bring forth from the Earth all it

92
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.000
is of your life.

93
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.600
So Sinners the world affects those four tasks, ultimately Adam

94
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.500
and Eve are cast out of the garden. So that sin doesn't just

95
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.800
affect Adam and Eve's tasks. It affects their ability to

96
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.600
relate to God to one another to

97
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.500
the world around them.

98
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.000
sin affects everything

99
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.900
So we ended two weeks ago by saying that God promised

100
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.000
in Genesis 3:15.

101
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.100
That he would send the seed of woman.

102
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.200
To restore what Adam lost to

103
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.100
reverse the curse of Adam and that's where we

104
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.000
left it and what I want you to what I want

105
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.100
you to remember as we begin our journey through the rest the Old

106
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.000
Testament is that the Old Testament is fundamentally.

107
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.400
a search for the seed

108
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.500
We are looking for the seed of woman.

109
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.100
The seed that will come and reverse the curse of

110
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.800
Adam the seed that will come and restore what Adam lost.

111
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.100
So we're not going to

112
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.300
be able to do what we did two weeks ago and walk sort

113
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.500
of verse by verse.

114
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.300
Three three chapters. I'm going to try to stop and pause

115
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.200
where I can but we're not going to

116
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.900
necessarily flip to every place that I'm going to mention. Okay.

117
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.200
So if you have questions tonight is

118
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.500
not the night to stop me to ask. I'm gonna try to bolt

119
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.600
to my car around 7:15 so I can make it home before the roads ice

120
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.600
again in Shawnee because there's another band of ice coming to

121
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.300
where I live. It might not hit edmon, but it's gonna hit Shawnee so

122
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.300
I'm gonna try to skate at all. But if you have questions keep them in mind and

123
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.600
I'll be happy to try to answer questions. You can

124
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.200
contact me in the middle of the week or next week when

125
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.100
I come. I'll try to answer those questions for you while I'm

126
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.800
here one last thing before we jump in last week.

127
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.200
I didn't mention OBU. I don't think at all. So this week,

128
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.300
I just decked it all out and and bison Green

129
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.100
I even have the OBU socks on. So if you want to

130
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.500
pair of those let me know. I'll try to hook you up. Okay, so we're looking

131
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.800
for the seed of woman.

132
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.600
and in Genesis 4

133
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.500
You know, I mean you get to think about this as you're reading

134
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.700
the Old Testament Genesis 3.

135
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.100
We're waiting on this seat of woman Genesis 4 Eve has

136
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:33.400
a kid.

137
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.900
Now look as as you're reading right you have

138
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.600
all this left and you know the story okay, but

139
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.000
just think about this if you're Adam and Eve.

140
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.100
Don't even just think about if you're Moses, Adam and Eve have a kid. What do you

141
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.700
think Eve's thinking?

142
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.400
Oh man, maybe it's this kid.

143
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.500
Maybe this kid is going to restore.

144
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.500
what me and

145
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.900
Dumbo over here lost in the garden.

146
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.000
And instead what happens?

147
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.200
Cain kills his brother Abel

148
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.100
things deteriorate very quickly

149
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.200
towards the end of Genesis 4

150
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.500
you have more children

151
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.100
that are mentioned and then Genesis 5.

152
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.100
What happens in well, actually indigenesis 4

153
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.000
not only does Cain kill his brother but lamech.

154
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.800
another descendant of Adam

155
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.700
kills a young boy

156
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.000
He just kind of gets mad and kills him.

157
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.700
He need to feel the depth of

158
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.300
depravity that exists already.

159
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.400
because we tend to think like

160
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.000
man, all Eve did was

161
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.700
eat a piece of fruit

162
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.700
But notice how quickly things deteriorate sin

163
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.700
is destructive sin is

164
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.100
pervasive sin has Cosmic effects

165
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.600
sin has personal and relational

166
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.700
effects already in the very next chapter.

167
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.300
You've got brother killing brother and then an older

168
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.900
man killing a young boy.

169
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.100
now that

170
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.400
I'm gonna I told you I wasn't gonna go slow but I'm

171
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.100
gonna go slow. So just think about this for

172
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.600
a second.

173
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.700
We're waiting on this seed of woman.

174
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.000
Eve's going hey, I just had two boys. I mean like

175
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.200
toss a coin god pick one of them. That's the reverse the curse guy,

176
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.400
right?

177
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.400
wrong

178
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.100
in fact if you look at

179
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.000
Genesis 4

180
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.000
verse 7

181
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.400
This is after Cain.

182
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.100
Has already become angry.

183
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.400
The Lord warns Cain and Genesis

184
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.700
4 verse 6. Why are you angry? And why is your face falling verse

185
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.500
7 if you do well, will you not be accepted? And

186
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.300
if you do not do well sin is crouching at the door.

187
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.300
Its desire is for you.

188
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.200
But you must rule over it. That's an

189
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.700
echo.

190
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.100
Both of what Adam and Eve

191
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.400
should have done they should have ruled over the serpent.

192
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.700
and also the effects

193
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.200
Of not ruling. Well, it's desire would be over. You

194
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.400
just like God said to Eve your desire your antagonism.

195
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.300
Your anger you're wanting to rule to

196
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.300
domineer will be over your husband sin wants to

197
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.500
dominate Cain.

198
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.100
But instead he should rule over it.

199
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.000
Like his parents should have ruled over the serpent. But what

200
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.000
does Cain do instead?

201
00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.900
He kills his brother.

202
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.500
things deteriorate rapidly

203
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.300
This guy ain't the seed.

204
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.800
Dead Abel over there ain't the seed.

205
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.600
By the time you get to the end of the chapter.

206
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.300
A number of Generations on lamech isn't

207
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.200
the seed either he kills a young boy doesn't just kill his old his brother

208
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200
who's around the same age.

209
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.000
He kills a young boy.

210
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.800
Things have already gotten crazy.

211
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.900
And then we get to Genesis 4:25.

212
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.300
Adam knew his wife again and she bore a son and called

213
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:35.900
his name Seth.

214
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.000
For she said God has appointed for me another Offspring

215
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.500
seed that's that word seed again.

216
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.600
God has appointed me another Offspring seed

217
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600
instead of Abel.

218
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.400
For Cain killed him. You can hear the Hope in E's voice

219
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.200
and Adam's voice. I'm going to name this

220
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.300
kid Seth.

221
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:57.800
because

222
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.000
God is appointed.

223
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.200
another Offspring another seed

224
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.200
and then we get to Seth also a son was born

225
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.200
and he was called enosh.

226
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.100
And look at this at that time people began to call upon the

227
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.600
name of the Lord.

228
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:16.900
There's Hope here

229
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.200
the line of the seed prevails

230
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.700
people are turning to God maybe enosh.

231
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.800
Or Seth his dad is the seed.

232
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:29.900
And then we get this.

233
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.100
chapter

234
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.100
that is full of genealogies.

235
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.700
And here's where everybody if they're going through the Bible chapter by

236
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.400
chapter just stops and says

237
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.100
like you make it to January 5th, and you're like

238
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.200
God I can't do it anymore. Look at these genealogies.

239
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.500
Maybe you Prevail and you make it to my birthday January

240
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.200
10th, but then you're like, oh man, this is worse in January

241
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.100
5th. I can't do anymore.

242
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.500
Genealogies are really important.

243
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.400
The First Gospel in the New Testament starts off

244
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.100
with what?

245
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.200
a genealogy

246
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.800
genealogies are important because they are acknowledgments and

247
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.200
records of God's Providence over

248
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:18.800
history.

249
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.500
To say that even as we and this is really important throughout

250
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.400
Genesis. Even as we forget who God is

251
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.500
God doesn't forget us in our promises and his

252
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.200
promises that he's made to us so he doesn't forget right here.

253
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.700
Notice how many years this is I'm not going to count them all up, but it's hundreds

254
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.700
of thousands of years.

255
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.700
That pass hundreds or thousands of years that passed if

256
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.200
you get from Genesis 5 verse 1 all the way down to

257
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:44.600
verse.

258
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.200
32 notice that

259
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.300
he repeats Moses repeats Genesis 2

260
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.300
verse 4 basically here. This is the book

261
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.700
of the generation of Adam in Genesis 2 verse

262
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.100
4 and 5. This is the book of the generation of the

263
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:01.800
heavens and the Earth.

264
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.600
So he's trying to get you to pay attention.

265
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.300
Pay attention to this genealogy pay attention to

266
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.000
the Legacy.

267
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.400
That's happening when God created man. He

268
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.500
made him in the likeness of God male and female. He

269
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.100
created them and he blessed them and named the man when they were created.

270
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.200
He's repeating himself trying to get you to

271
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.300
pay attention. Don't skip over the genealogies read

272
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.500
through them. Look at God's Providence. Thank God for his Providence

273
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:33.900
over the course of a hundred 900,000 2000

274
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.900
years. However long it takes to get from Genesis 5:1

275
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.300
to Genesis 5:32 that God is

276
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.000
providential.

277
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.500
Over the course of history in making sure that

278
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.000
he fulfills his promises.

279
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.500
Cain already forgot God

280
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.500
five seconds

281
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.500
into his adult life

282
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.300
Adam and Eve forgot God five seconds into their

283
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.200
time in the garden.

284
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.300
Lamech forgets God and kills a young

285
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.100
boy, but God doesn't forget his promises to us.

286
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.900
contrast Abel's name

287
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.400
You know Abel's name means.

288
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:16.900
anybody

289
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.100
means breath

290
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.900
It's the same word that the writer of Ecclesiastes uses when he

291
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.400
says all is Vanity or all is vapor.

292
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.700
It's here and then it's gone.

293
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.000
That's what Abel's name means.

294
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:35.900
we

295
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.500
Both because we are finite we're not God and because we're falling

296
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.200
we're sinful.

297
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.100
We don't last.

298
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.700
We don't remember God's.

299
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.000
Instructions to us. We don't remember God's promises to

300
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.500
us, but God remembers his promises to us.

301
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.400
And keeps them.

302
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.800
So we read through these this genealogy number of

303
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.800
generations. And then finally we get to verse 32.

304
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.900
After Noah was 500 years old Noah father Shem ham and

305
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.300
japheth.

306
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.000
and then

307
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.300
so

308
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.100
we're going. All right, like God's tracking the line of the seed here.

309
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.100
Maybe this is gonna be it.

310
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.400
This is what you need to keep paying attention to as you read through the Old Testament.

311
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.500
Maybe this guy's the seed.

312
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.100
Maybe This Is It

313
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.300
But look what happens when man began to multiply on the

314
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.600
face of the land chapter 6 verse 1 and daughters were

315
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.200
born to them the sons of God saw that the daughters of

316
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.200
man were attractive.

317
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.000
And they took as their wives and they chose.

318
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.400
Then the Lord said my spirit shall not abide in man

319
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.000
forever for he is flesh his days shall be 120 years.

320
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.600
The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward when the

321
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.200
sons of God came into the daughters of man and they bore children

322
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.200
to them. These are the Mighty Men Who were of old the men

323
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.600
of renown?

324
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.500
Verse 5 and this is the key here. The Lord saw that

325
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.700
the wickedness of man was great in the Earth.

326
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.100
And that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was

327
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.600
only evil continually.

328
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.500
In the Lord was sorry that he had made man on the earth and it grieved

329
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.200
him to his heart. So the Lord said I will blot out man. Who am

330
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.500
I have created from the face of the land?

331
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.500
Listen to this language. I will blot out man. Whom I

332
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.900
have created from the face of the land man and

333
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.200
animals and creeping things and birds of

334
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.500
the heavens for I'm sorry that I have made them noticed. That's

335
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.300
a backwards order from Genesis 1

336
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:35.700
man

337
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.500
animals creeping things Birds

338
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.000
God is going to uncreate.

339
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.900
What he has created?

340
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:45.900
Why?

341
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:48.700
because

342
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.400
Verse 6 or verse 5 every intention

343
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.700
of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

344
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.600
This is the back and forth of Genesis.

345
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.100
We're waiting on the seed who's going

346
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.100
to reverse the curse of Adam restore what Adam lost but everybody

347
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.900
is terrible.

348
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.000
At every step of the way.

349
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.900
Adam fails

350
00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.700
Cain fails lamech fails

351
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.400
Hey, here's Noah. Let's see how he does.

352
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.700
Now I'm not gonna read this whole thing. I assume that you are familiar

353
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.600
relatively familiar with the story of the flood.

354
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.000
God tells Noah to build a boat.

355
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.100
Sends a flood rains for 40 days and

356
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.400
40 nights Noah and his three sons and their wives

357
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.200
are the only human beings on the boat. They

358
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.200
get all the other animals two by two on the ark God is

359
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.100
rescuing.

360
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.800
a remnant

361
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.400
from sinful Humanity

362
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.400
God sends this boat to rescue a Remnant

363
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.400
from sinful Humanity.

364
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.700
And notice what he says to Noah.

365
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.500
in verse 17

366
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.300
For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the

367
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.800
Earth To Destroy All Flesh.

368
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.400
In which is the Breath of Life under Heaven everything that is on

369
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.100
the Earth shall die.

370
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.200
But I will establish my Covenant with you and you

371
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.300
shall come into the ark you your sons and your wife and your son's

372
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.800
wives with you and of every living thing of All Flesh you

373
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.100
shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep

374
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.600
them alive with you pay attention to the language. They shall be male and

375
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.200
female of the birds according to their kinds and

376
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.200
of the animals according to their kinds and of every creeping thing on

377
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.300
the ground according to its kind of every sort shall come

378
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.000
in to keep them alive also take with you every sort of

379
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.200
food that has eaten and store it up it shall service food for

380
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.700
you. And for them that is

381
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.400
the same language as Creation in Genesis

382
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:48.800
1

383
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.800
God is going to rescue Noah and

384
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.300
his family to create a new creation.

385
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.700
He's going to cleanse the world of sin, and he's

386
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.100
going to start afresh by redeeming a

387
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.400
remnant.

388
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.500
I mean, I I've got to move quicker than this you guys are killing

389
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.800
me with how slow you're making me go. No, it's my fault.

390
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.900
I mean if you if you were to read through the through chapter

391
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.200
7 you would see things like male and female over

392
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.100
and over again and verses 2 and 3 you would see things

393
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.300
like in them was the Breath of Life in verse

394
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.100
15. The 40 days is a really

395
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.100
important number for the rest of the Old Testament.

396
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.400
In any case in chapter 8 God remembered Noah and

397
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.300
all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark and God made

398
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.700
a wind notices. God made a wind a ruach a

399
00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.100
spirit.

400
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.000
Yes, Siri, I don't

401
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.200
know if you guys heard that or not. But Siri thought I was talking to her. God made a wind

402
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.500
blow over the earth and the waters.

403
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:52.900
subsided

404
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.400
now remember what happened in Genesis

405
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:57.800
1

406
00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.300
verse 2

407
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.100
the Earth was without form and void.

408
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.300
In the spirit hovered over the waters.

409
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.900
Well now the spirit and I think this is appropriate.

410
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.600
To say God made his own Spirit blow over the Earth in the waters subsided.

411
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:18.800
the Holy Spirit

412
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.700
Parts the waters

413
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.800
just like he does in Genesis 1 to separate

414
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.800
the water from the dry land.

415
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.300
Fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed the rain from the heavens was

416
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.300
restrained the waters were seated from the earth continually at the

417
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.200
end of 150 days. The waters had abated in the seventh month

418
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.200
on the 17th day of the month the art came to rest in the Mountains of Ararat.

419
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.100
Etc. Etc. Noah sends out Birds

420
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.700
Etc, etc. And then finally in verse 15 of chapter

421
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.800
8 God says to know it go out from the ark.

422
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.300
And verse 17 bring with you. Every living thing that is with you of All

423
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.000
Flesh birds and animals and every creeping thing that Creeps in the

424
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.700
Earth. Again. That's Genesis 1 straight out of it. And then look what he says that they

425
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.000
may swarm on the Earth.

426
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.200
And be fruitful and multiply.

427
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.700
On the earth this is this looks like new creation

428
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.900
and you're going I mean in your head you're going. All right.

429
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.500
Man Cain, he fell really fast.

430
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.800
Sorry Kane you're out.

431
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.400
Lamech not great. You're out. All these other dudes in

432
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.100
Genesis 5 dead. You're out Noah, though.

433
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.500
Man, Noah, no actually obeyed Noah built

434
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.100
the art God put all these people in an art maybe no

435
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:36.900
is the seed.

436
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.100
Then you start hearing this Genesis 1 and 2 language again

437
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.100
about being fruitful and multiplying.

438
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.100
Verse 20 Noah built an altar of to the Lord took some

439
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.900
very clean animal and some very clean bird and offered burnt offerings Noah's

440
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.300
worshiping God.

441
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.100
When the Lord smelled the pleasing Aroma the Lord said in his

442
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.600
heart, I will never again curse the ground because of man for the intention of man's

443
00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.800
heart is evil from his youth.

444
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.200
Neither will I ever strike down every living creature as I've done while the Earth

445
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.200
remains seedtime and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day

446
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.100
and night shall not cease.

447
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.500
Now listen to this in chapter 9 verse 1 God blessed Noah and

448
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.400
his sons and said to them be fruitful and multiply and

449
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.600
fill the Earth.

450
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.600
That's a direct quote of Genesis, 1:28 and

451
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.300
26.

452
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.900
That's not quite the same though.

453
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.000
The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the

454
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.500
earth and upon every bird of the heavens upon everything that creeps

455
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.100
on the ground and the fish of the sea into your hands. They are delivered.

456
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.200
Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you.

457
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.100
And as I gave you the green plants I gave you everything so this is not quite the same. Something's still

458
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:44.600
not quite right.

459
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.300
But you shall not eat flesh with its life. That is it's blood. No, I'm not saying you

460
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.400
can't have steak in heaven because I'm gonna need a steak, but I'm just in in

461
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.800
Genesis 1 he only gives them green plants to eat.

462
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.500
And he doesn't say that Noah Noah will

463
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.600
strike fear in the animals. He says love dominion

464
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.200
over them doesn't say the fear him here. It's a

465
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.500
little bit different.

466
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.500
They're going to fear Noah. They're gonna be killed by Noah. It's

467
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.100
not quite the same.

468
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.400
Even though it sounds the same.

469
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.200
Verse 5 and for your life blood I will require Reckoning from every

470
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.300
Beast. I'll require it and from man from his fellow man. I will

471
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.200
require a reckoning for the life of man. Whoever sheds the

472
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.000
blood of Man by man. Shall his blood be shed for God made man in

473
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.200
his own image and you

474
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.200
be fruitful and multiplied team on

475
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.200
the earth and multiply in it. So it sounds

476
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:35.300
like

477
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.600
New Creation

478
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.900
But there are some hints.

479
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.500
That it's we're not quite there yet.

480
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.200
God is telling Noah to be fruitful multiply. He's put him on

481
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.900
dry land after partying The Waters at all. Sounds like Genesis

482
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.000
1 and 2 hurray we're back.

483
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.200
But look what Noah does after God makes his Covenant. God says, hey, I'm

484
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.300
not gonna flood the Earth again. I'm gonna put this sign a rainbow

485
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.300
in the air which is sort of like his bow.

486
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.000
Stretched towards heaven rather than towards Earth.

487
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.100
Is the image there?

488
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.200
I'm not going to destroy you again.

489
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.000
Here's my Covenant.

490
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.000
And what does Noah do?

491
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:21.500
Verse 18

492
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.300
The sons of Noah went forth from who went forth from the ark were Shem

493
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.300
ham and japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.

494
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.400
These three were the sons of Noah and from these the people of the whole earth were

495
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:32.800
dispersed.

496
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.300
Noah began to be a man of the soil and he planted a

497
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:36.600
Vineyard.

498
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.500
He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay

499
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.600
uncovered uncovered in his tent he was naked not naked

500
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.800
and ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and

501
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.300
told us to Brothers outside then sham and japheth

502
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.500
took a garment late once late on both their shoulders and walked backward

503
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.600
and covered the nakedness of their father their faces

504
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.400
were turned backward. They didn't see their father's nakedness. No awoke

505
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.000
friends wine and what his youngest son had done to him. He said

506
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.500
curse became in a servant of servant Shelly be to his brothers.

507
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.200
He also said blessed be the Lord the god of Shame and let Cain and

508
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.100
be a servant. May God enlarge japheth and let him join the tens of shim and let

509
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.000
Canaan be a servant.

510
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.200
After the flood Noah left 350 years all the days of

511
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.000
no were 950 years and he died.

512
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.400
Okay. So what we see in Genesis 6 through

513
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.100
9 is a an extended version.

514
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.300
of this pattern we've started to see

515
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.800
what we're waiting on is the seed of woman to restore

516
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.200
what Adam lost. We're waiting on a new

517
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:35.500
Adam.

518
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.200
We're waiting on someone to come and actually have dominion.

519
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.000
actually, obey

520
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.800
And then actually be fruitful multiply and care

521
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.300
for God's place and Noah.

522
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.500
Of everybody else so far.

523
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.800
Looks like he's the guy.

524
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.600
But just like Adam failed just like Cain

525
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.800
failed just like lamech failed.

526
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.700
Noah fails

527
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:08.000
Cain kills his brother lamette kills a young boy. Noah gets

528
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.800
drunk and naked.

529
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.600
Chapter 10 another genealogy things look pretty dire right

530
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.700
now in chapter 9 at the end.

531
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.400
Humanity's last best hope

532
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.400
Noah of the Ark

533
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.600
Failed, I mean think about it. God just destroyed everything.

534
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.500
Like no, no was it we're done.

535
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.300
It was Noah.

536
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.200
His three sons and their wives I'm not great at

537
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.700
math, but I think that's only eight people.

538
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.200
And the guy that looks like the new Adam is dunzo.

539
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.000
Nevertheless in spite of our sinfulness in

540
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.400
spite of our faithlessness God

541
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.100
remains faithful because Genesis 10 tracks a

542
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.700
genealogy.

543
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:02.900
once again

544
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.400
We're tracking this genealogy. It tracks shim. Cane

545
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.400
shim. Ham and japheth.

546
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.400
Kanan Sons become a ham Sons essentially

547
00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.000
become the enemies of Israel.

548
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.500
sin has

549
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.100
generational consequences not that future. Generations

550
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.800
are responsible for their previous generation sins,

551
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.700
but that

552
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.000
sinful households produce

553
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.200
sin-filled children, and I'm not saying that you have

554
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.000
to be a perfect parent.

555
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.100
For your kids to be saved. That's not it at all.

556
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.400
The only thing that can save your kids is Jesus Christ

557
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.500
through the power of the Holy Spirit.

558
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.500
You can be the most perfect parent who's written all the parenting books in the world. And

559
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.900
that's still not going to save your kid.

560
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.900
But it is to say that turning away from the Lord.

561
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.700
And turning towards sin and idolatry.

562
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.700
without the grace of God

563
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.700
So all of us, that's everybody has generational

564
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.100
effects.

565
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.900
And that's what we see with hams line.

566
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.500
On the other hand what God is tracing through she and

567
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.600
jafest line, especially shims line is that

568
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.700
God is still gracious to us even

569
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.600
in spite of our faithlessness.

570
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.600
we don't deserve anything, right I mean

571
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.800
Know what doesn't deserve anything here.

572
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.300
Neither do his sons frankly.

573
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.900
They were sort of drug onto the boat.

574
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.100
And the only thing that Jim and japheth do well is that they

575
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.000
don't want to see their dad.

576
00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.400
In a stupor with no clothes on well, okay, that's

577
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.900
not a really high bar for righteousness.

578
00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.200
God demonstrates his faithfulness through tracking all of

579
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.400
these people throughout Genesis 10, then we get and we're like, all right, God you're

580
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.800
gonna bring somebody finally, right?

581
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.400
Genesis 11

582
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.400
Tower of Babel

583
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.200
The Descendants

584
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.600
of Noah's Three Sons settled together

585
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.600
build this Tower of Babel try to make their

586
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.500
way up to the heavens. Essentially. They're trying to be God

587
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.200
and God says Nope.

588
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.500
See you scatters them changes, everybody's

589
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.700
language. What was that? What were Adam and Eve supposed to do they're

590
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.300
supposed to be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth instead.

591
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.100
These jabronis are building a tower in one place

592
00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.500
trying to make their way up to be God.

593
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.800
The opposite of what they were supposed to do so God accomplishes his

594
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.100
purpose which is to fill the Earth.

595
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.300
But not in the way that Adam and Eve were supposed to feel the Earth Adam and

596
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.000
Eve were supposed to fill the Earth, you know obedience instead God

597
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.000
fills the Earth in spite of Humanity's Disobedience

598
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.700
Adam and Eve were supposed to worship God

599
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.400
in his place instead. These people are building

600
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.300
up a tower to God to be gods.

601
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:04.900
in the wrong place

602
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.100
So God scatters them this this is the

603
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.200
progression. I just I'm belaboring this in Genesis 4 through 11

604
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.700
because you need to see the progression.

605
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.100
This is a progression. We're going to see over and over again that

606
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:18.200
God

607
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400
is faithful

608
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.500
and we see that especially through genealogies in Genesis.

609
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.800
in spite of our faithlessness

610
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.100
God calls Adam and Eve to

611
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.300
Rule, obey be fruitful multiply care

612
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.000
for creation, Adam and Eve fail.

613
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.900
He warns Cain don't let sin Master

614
00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.600
you Cain fails lamech doesn't

615
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.600
even pay attention to God lamech fails.

616
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.300
God calls Noah you're gonna you and your

617
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.900
sons are going to be a Remnant Noah and his sons fail.

618
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.400
Humanity at the end of this

619
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.200
first section of Genesis Genesis 1 through 11

620
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.500
Is a total failure?

621
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.100
at this point

622
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.700
we've already seen in Genesis 6.

623
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.200
And really, you know, we've gone from murder.

624
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.200
To sexual sin and Genesis 6 with

625
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.100
the women and the sons of God whoever they

626
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.700
are. Maybe Angel maybe evil angels, maybe not.

627
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.000
Gone from murder to sexual sin.

628
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.500
to drunkenness

629
00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.200
and perhaps for version there.

630
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.200
finally to

631
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.100
just pure blatant.

632
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.800
idolatry

633
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.600
Now we might reverse those.

634
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.600
Say idolatry is the least bad, but it's the worst.

635
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.900
And it's the root of all sin because you're putting yourself.

636
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.300
Or something else in place of the only God who

637
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.000
actually is God.

638
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.200
And at this point God could say I'm done.

639
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.400
But instead we get another genealogy.

640
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.200
Verse 10. These are the generations of Shem.

641
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.700
and at the end of the generations of Shem

642
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.200
we get in verse 27 of

643
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.400
chapter 11. These are the generations of terra, terra father Abram

644
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.600
nahorn and Iran father lot.

645
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.900
And so Abram enters the scene.

646
00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.100
and

647
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.600
the story of Abram who becomes

648
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.100
Abraham

649
00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.700
Is the story of what God is

650
00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.300
going to do?

651
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:42.900
to redeem

652
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.000
the story of Abram who becomes Abraham is the story

653
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.300
of what God is going to do to redeem. Look at chapter 12 verse 1

654
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.200
Now the Lord said to Abram go from your country and your Kendra and

655
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.300
your father's house to land that I will show you and I will make of you

656
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.100
a great nation. I'll bless you and make your name great so that you will be a

657
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.400
blessing. I will bless those who bless you and him who dishonors you

658
00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.000
all curse. And in you all the families of the Earth shall

659
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.300
be blessed.

660
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.100
And so they go and they move I'll come

661
00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.500
back to that. Look at chapter 15. I'm just going to read you some of the promises that

662
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.300
God makes to Abram. So

663
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.500
look over in chapter 15.

664
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.300
After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision fear, not

665
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:31.000
Abram. I am your Shield your reward shall be very great. But Abram

666
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.200
said, oh Lord God, what will you give me for I

667
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.400
continue childless in the air of my house is Eleazar of Damascus

668
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.300
and Abrams said behold, you have given me no Offspring and

669
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.900
a member of my household will be my heir.

670
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.200
And behold the word of the Lord came to him this man shall

671
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.200
not be your Heir your very own son shall be your ear and he

672
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.300
brought him outside and said look toward heaven and Number the Stars if you

673
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.700
are able to number them then he said to him. So shall your Offspring

674
00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.200
be and he believed the Lord and he counted

675
00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.200
it to him as righteousness and he said

676
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.100
to him. I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give

677
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.300
you this land to possess, but he said oh Lord God, how am I to know

678
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.200
that I shall possess it?

679
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.400
Said to him bring me a heifer three years old a female goat three years old or

680
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.400
ran three years old a turtle dove and a young pigeon.

681
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.200
And he brought him all these cut them in half and Lady chaff over against

682
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.900
the other but he did not cut the birds in half.

683
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.500
And when Birds of Prey came down on the carcasses at Abram

684
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.300
drove them away as the sun was going down a deep sleep fell on

685
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.000
Abram and behold Dreadful and great Darkness fell upon him.

686
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.300
Then the Lord said to Abram no for certain that your Offspring

687
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.200
will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there

688
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.400
and they will be afflicted for 400 years, but I will bring judgment

689
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.300
on the nation that they serve and afterwards they shall come

690
00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.100
out with great possessions as for yourself. You shall go to

691
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.200
your fathers and peace. You'll be buried in a good old age and

692
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.500
they shall come back here in the fourth generation for the iniquity of

693
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.400
the amorites is not yet complete.

694
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.000
And then the sun goes down a smoking fire pot

695
00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.400
and the flaming torch passed between

696
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.500
the pieces and the Lord says to Abram to

697
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.000
your Offspring I give this land and then gives the boundaries.

698
00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:08.700
Look at chapter 17.

699
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:11.700
verse 5

700
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.100
Well verse 4 behold my Covenant is with you and you should be the father of

701
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.200
a multitude of Nations no longer shall your name be

702
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.200
called Abram but your name Shall be Called Abraham for I've made

703
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.900
you the father of a multitude of Nations. I will make you exceedingly fruitful hear

704
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.500
that and I will make you into Nations and King

705
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.400
shall come from you and I will establish my Covenant between

706
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.200
me and you and your Offspring after you throughout their generations for

707
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.300
an Everlasting Covenant to be God to you and to

708
00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.600
your Offspring hear that seed after you and I

709
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.300
will give to you and to your Offspring your seed after you

710
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.500

711
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.300
an everlasting possession and I will be their God

712
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.700
and God said to Abraham as for you. You shall keep my Covenant you

713
00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.500
and your Offspring after you throughout their Generations.

714
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.300
This is my Covenant which you shall keep between me

715
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.500
and you and your Offspring after you every male among you shall be

716
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.800
circumcised.

717
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.200
So listen to what God promises Abram and later

718
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.200
named Abraham. I'm just going to call Abraham from

719
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:11.600
now on.

720
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.700
Listen to what God promises Abraham.

721
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.300
He says he's going to give him many descendants.

722
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.800
He says kings are going to come from your line.

723
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.500
he says I'm going to give you this land that's

724
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.100
Later described as flowing with milk and honey.

725
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.200
And I'm giving you a rule.

726
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:33.900
circumcision

727
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.900
Oh, and by the way, the the seed Offspring is

728
00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.700
coming from your line.

729
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.900
many descendants

730
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.200
What's God promising to do?

731
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.100
he's promising to make sure that

732
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.700
his people are fruitful and multiply.

733
00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.800
Kings are going to come from your line. What are Kings do?

734
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.700
They rule they have dominion.

735
00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.800
I'm gonna give you a land that's flowing with milk and honey. So you

736
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.500
can care for it.

737
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.200
And I'm gonna give you a rule to obey.

738
00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.900
Ultimately, your line is the line of the seed the

739
00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.500
promise one is going to reverse the curse of Adam. Here's

740
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.500
the deal the Covenant that God makes labor and

741
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.100
the promises that God makes to Abraham our

742
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.900
promises of what God

743
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.500
will do which is to reverse the curse

744
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.200
of Adam to restore what Adam lost

745
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.600
the promises to Abraham are what God is going to do. He's

746
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.600
going to reverse the curse of Adam. It's

747
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.900
going to restore what Adam lost

748
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.400
That's what we're looking for. Listen. I I

749
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.300
talked about this two weeks ago, but it's really

750
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.600
important that you hear that sin doesn't just affect.

751
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.400
Adam and Eve's individual relationships with God it's certainly

752
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.100
does affect that.

753
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.400
But it also affects the very purpose for their

754
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.300
existence and the way God made the world it affects everything.

755
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.000
Thorn isn't thistles. You're gonna bring up from the ground cursed is

756
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:08.900
the ground because of you.

757
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.200
You're gonna hate your spouse. Your spouse is gonna hate

758
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.700
you. It's gonna hurt to make babies.

759
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.000
Your work is going to be futile. Everything that

760
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.100
God intended in creation is broken by

761
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.600
sin.

762
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.900
And here's what God is saying to Abraham.

763
00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.100
I'm not just going to

764
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.600
help you fly away.

765
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.300
And not be here anymore and then blow everything

766
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.400
else up like Darth Vader does to Alder on

767
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.000
with the Death Star?

768
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.300
Instead what I'm going to do is I'm going

769
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.200
to redeem what Adam lost.

770
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:46.900
All of it.

771
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.700
My purpose is in creation are not going to be thwarted by

772
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.800
your sin and your disobedience.

773
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.400
Instead. I'm going to bring about I'm going to bring to pass what

774
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.500
I always intended.

775
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.700
Which is to fill the Earth with worshipers of Yahweh image

776
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.000
bearers.

777
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.400
Who will rule over God's Place care for it and obey his

778
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:10.700
word?

779
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.500
In Abraham, I'm going to do that through your line.

780
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.000
God's promises of Salvation are as big as

781
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.500
his purposes for creation.

782
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.100
God's promises of Salvation are as big as his

783
00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.300
purposes for creation.

784
00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.700
I don't have time for this but I'm gonna say it. Anyway, we look we

785
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.100
have this weird view of Salvation where it is

786
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.400
totally individualistic. It's just me and God, it's Josh

787
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:40.800
Turner.

788
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.500
I love Josh Turner got a great voice. That song

789
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:44.900
is terrible.

790
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.600
Me and go. Okay. No, look it's it's more

791
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.100
than you and God that God is saving

792
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.400
and restoring in sending his

793
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.300
son to die on the cross and rise from the dead. He is

794
00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.500
saving you individually, but he's also restoring what Adam lost

795
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:01.900
all of it.

796
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.200
the whole thing the whole enchilada

797
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.100
when he promises to Abraham he's going to multiply his

798
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.100
descendants. His kings are

799
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:16.300
going to come from his line. He's gonna get a landfilling with milk and honey that he

800
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.200
gives him a rule to obey and that the sea is going to come from him.

801
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.500
That is a promise to restore all that atom lost.

802
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.600
This idea that we're going to you know float around

803
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.400
on clouds.

804
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.300
With angels wings and no bodies and no Earth,

805
00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.200
but somehow we're all so playing a harp. That's not the vision of

806
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.600
salvation of the Bible gives.

807
00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.300
The vision of redemption of the Bible gives is Cosmic.

808
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.500
That doesn't mean universal salvation for everybody.

809
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.000
People still have to repent and believe in the Lord. Jesus to be

810
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:50.400
saved.

811
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.800
But it does mean that God is doing something big

812
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.800
bigger than you and me individually.

813
00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.400
In Salvation, he's restoring what Adam lost.

814
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.500
So we continue through the story of Abraham. I'm not

815
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.200
going to I don't have time to walk through most of

816
00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.000
this. It would be great. If we did I thought about in the like 15

817
00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.300
minutes ago just turning this into a study of Genesis for

818
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.400
four weeks, but I'll try to get a little bit further. So

819
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.200
here's the deal. If you have read this

820
00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.500
story of Abraham, you know that the same pattern that we saw with Adam

821
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.500
and Cain and lamech and

822
00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.500
Noah and the Tower of Babel that same

823
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.200
pattern exists with Abraham.

824
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.000
God calls Abraham from Ur of the Chaldeans Abraham

825
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.500
obeys comes down Builds an altar. Everything's

826
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.900
great. Very next verse. What does he do?

827
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.400
Goes down to Egypt tries to pass his wife off

828
00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.900
as a sister. So the Pharaoh won't get mad at him.

829
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.800
God rescues him from that. What's the danger there?

830
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.900
It's not just a danger to their relationship. It's

831
00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.500
a danger to the line of the seed.

832
00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.400
Because a pharaoh goes in and sleeps with Sarah.

833
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.700
And then Abraham does will.

834
00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.100
It's like a you know ancient nor Eastern version of Jerry

835
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.000
Springer. Like who's the baby daddy? We don't know.

836
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.800
Okay, it's a threat to the line of the seed.

837
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:18.500
But instead God preserves the line. He pulls Sarah

838
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:21.300
out of there. How does he do that through sending plagues on Egypt. Does

839
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.100
that sound familiar to you?

840
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.100
Abraham comes back out of Egypt back into the land.

841
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.500
God makes a promise again in Genesis 15. What is Abraham do

842
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.100
immediately?

843
00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.200
He sleeps with his.

844
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.700
Wife's servant Hagar who happens to be by the way. What an

845
00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:43.400
Egyptian slave woman. Does that something here Egyptian slavery?

846
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:44.600
right

847
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.300
obedience

848
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.800
no faithlessness

849
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.700
God makes another promise great faithlessness

850
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.800
God makes another promise great faithlessness

851
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.500
Finally Abraham seems to get it on Mount Moriah where God

852
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.900
calls him to sacrifice Isaac.

853
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:06.000
By the end of the story Abraham does really believe he buries

854
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.700
Sarah he purchases the first piece of land at

855
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.200
Syria Sarah's burial place the cave of mock pull

856
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:11.300
up.

857
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.300
Abraham the rest of Genesis is

858
00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.900
a search for the seed through Genesis through Abraham's line. Abraham

859
00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.200
has a son by Sarah.

860
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.400
He has another son Ishmael, but he has a son by Sarah Isaac.

861
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.300
Isaac marries a woman named Rebecca who

862
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.100
initially is barren.

863
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.100
I mean there's a there's a pattern for you as well. Sarah old

864
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.800
and barren.

865
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.200
Rebecca barren woman God opens her womb

866
00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.400
she has twins.

867
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.100
Jacob and Esau Jacob and Esau is a great story. We don't

868
00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.200
have time to go into it. But if we did we would see

869
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.200
that Jacob in his treachery.

870
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.200
Is really just exhibiting faithlessness and God

871
00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.100
to fulfill his promises and so his rate. So is Rebecca for

872
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:00.300
that matter?

873
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:05.000
God tells Rebecca Jacob's going to be the son of the promise but Rebecca

874
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.300
doesn't trust God to make that happen. So Rebecca and

875
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.500
Jacob take into their own hands.

876
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.900
With bad consequences. So again faithlessness faithfulness of

877
00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:13.000
God.

878
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.400
Jacob eventually marries Four Women if you

879
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.100
read the story, it's obvious. That's not a recommended life

880
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:24.400
strategy and they eventually

881
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.600
he has 12 sons by those four

882
00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:26.900
women.

883
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.200
One of those Sons is the first son that he has by

884
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.300
Rachel the woman that he really loves.

885
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.900
and Joseph again looks like

886
00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.400
a new Adam if you know the story of Joseph, you

887
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.800
know that Joseph is

888
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.700
clothed by his dad.

889
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:52.000
Gets that Dreamcoat Technicolor those

890
00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.100
words are not in the Bible, but he gets a coat from

891
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.400
his dad and his brother and he

892
00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.300
tells his brothers. Hey guys, I'm gonna be in charge of you one day which is also is again

893
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.400
not a great leadership strategy and they sell

894
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.600
them into slavery to Egypt.

895
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.900
There's that theme again slavery in Egypt.

896
00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.500
And Joseph goes into slavery. He's

897
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:12.900
he

898
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.200
of everybody else in Genesis. What is Joseph in the face of

899
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:17.800
Temptation?

900
00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.200
When Potiphar's wife tries to get

901
00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.400
Joseph, what does Joseph do?

902
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.200
He flees from sin.

903
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.100
unlike Adam

904
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.700
unlike Cain unlike lamech

905
00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:35.200
unlike Noah unlike Abraham unlike Isaac

906
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:38.300
unlike his dad Jacob Joseph flees

907
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.700
from sin.

908
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:39.900
Wait a minute.

909
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:41.500
Now we're talking.

910
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.400
He gets put in jail, though.

911
00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:46.300
whoops

912
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.700
go to jail. Well, wait a minute. Joseph can interpret dreams

913
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.100
and you might think well, that's cool. But what does

914
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.800
that do anything? Well, here's the deal in the dreams that Joseph interprets, especially

915
00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.000
for Pharaoh. What can Joseph tell the difference between with

916
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.600
pharaoh?

917
00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.600
There is seven years of what?

918
00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.800
Plenty and seven years of famine and in

919
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.600
Hebrew.

920
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.700
Especially when he's talking about the grain.

921
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.500
It's seven years of good grain.

922
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.800
And seven years of evil or bad

923
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.500
grain.

924
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.800
What can Joseph tell the difference between?

925
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.400
Good.

926
00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.000
and Evil

927
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.300
the Baker and the cup Bearer he can tell the difference between life

928
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:35.800
and death.

929
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.200
Joseph flees from sin Joseph can tell the difference

930
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:44.100
between good and evil Joseph Rises to

931
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.900
second in command in Egypt just under

932
00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.500
the authority of the king. Guess what he represents.

933
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.200
He represents the authority of the king in the land that the king

934
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:54.700
gives him.

935
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.800
Joseph receives the ring and the cloak that

936
00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.200
Pharaoh gives him he's clothed in the king's image.

937
00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.500
Joseph gets a wife.

938
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.300
from pharaoh

939
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.400
The king gives him a helpmate.

940
00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:15.600
Wait a minute.

941
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.500
What does all that sound like?

942
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.300
Sounds like Adam again, right?

943
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.900
Joseph sounds like a new Adam.

944
00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:30.400
Joseph is second in command. He's clothed in the image of the king. He's

945
00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:34.100
given a wife by the king. He's given dominion over

946
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.800
a land. That is fruitful.

947
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.600
His name Joseph's name means to add

948
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.200
or to multiply in Hebrew.

949
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.700
Not exactly the same word, but it's a synonym.

950
00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.400
Joseph looks like a new Adam. What's the problem?

951
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.300
Well, if this is the seed first of

952
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.500
all, what's the seed supposed to do in order to banish the

953
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.800
effects of sin and restore what Adam lost?

954
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.500
What did God say that the seed of woman would do to the

955
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:05.900
serpent?

956
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.200
crush his head

957
00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.300
Joseph doesn't Crush anybody's head and in his

958
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.100
story as far as I can tell.

959
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.300
What's another problem? Where is he?

960
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.200
He's in Egypt. Is he in the land that God promised

961
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.000
to Abraham?

962
00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.200
Nope.

963
00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:24.500
There's a final problem.

964
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.200
And I want you to look at Genesis 37.

965
00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.200
And this is this is one of those places where I want you to see that paying attention

966
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.300
to patterns and weird stuff can help you read your

967
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:34.500
Bible.

968
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.400
Sorry Genesis 38. So Genesis 37 is the

969
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.700
story of Joseph and his 12 Brothers.

970
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.900
Where they sell them into slavery Genesis 39 picks

971
00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.200
up on Joseph's story. But then

972
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.000
in the middle, there's this very strange story.

973
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.700
That if you made it through the genealogies of Genesis 5 and

974
00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.500
you made it through the genealogies of dentists 10 and

975
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.600
you made it through all the story of Abraham and Isaac

976
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.200
and Jacob and even to Joseph and you get to

977
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.400
Genesis 38 you might be going at this point. Okay God

978
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.600
I can't take this anymore. It's too weird.

979
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.500
Listen to the story.

980
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.500
And feels like are you really gonna read this? I'm Really Gonna read it. It happened

981
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.200
at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and turned aside to

982
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.300
a certain adulamite whose name was Hira.

983
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.000
They're Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name

984
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.900
Yeshua. He took her and went into her and she canceived and borisan and he

985
00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:29.500
called his name her.

986
00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:33.900
She conceived again and borisan and she called his name Onan yet

987
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:37.800
again. She bore a son and she called his name Sheila Judah

988
00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.500
was in chezib when she

989
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:39.900
bore him.

990
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.300
And Judah took a wife or his first born her name

991
00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:46.400
was Tamar, but Ur, Jesus firstborn was wicked in

992
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.900
the sight of the Lord and Lord put him to death.

993
00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.400
Then Judah said to own and go into your brother's wife and perform

994
00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.900
the duty of a brother-in-law to her and raise up Offspring for your brother.

995
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.200
But Onan neither The Offspring would not be his so whenever

996
00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.300
he went into his brother's wife. He would waste the seamen on the ground. So as not

997
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.500
to give The Offspring to his brother.

998
00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.000
And what he did was wicked in the side of the Lord and he put him to death also.

999
00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.200
Then Judas had to Tamar his daughter-in-law remain a

1000
00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.600
widow and your father's house till Shayla my son grows up.

1001
00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.400
For he feared that he would die like his brothers. So Tamar went

1002
00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.800
and remained in her father's house.

1003
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.200
In the course of time the wife of Judah. She was

1004
00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.500
daughter died when Judah was comforted. He went up to timna

1005
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:26.200
to a sheep shearers. He and his friend hero the adulomite.

1006
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.500
And when Tamar was told your father-in-law is going up to timna.

1007
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.200
This year's sheep. She took off her widow's garments and covered herself with a

1008
00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:35.700
veil wrapping herself up inside of the instruments to Naim which

1009
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.400
is on the road to timna for she saw that Shayla

1010
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.500
was grown up and she had not been given to him in marriage.

1011
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:44.300
When Judah saw her he thought she was a prostitute for she had covered her

1012
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:47.300
face. He turned to her at the roadside and said come let

1013
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.000
me come into you for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.

1014
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.700
She said what will you give me that? You may come into me? He answered.

1015
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.100
I will send you a young goat from the flock and she said if you

1016
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.700
give me a pledge until you send it he said what Pledge Your

1017
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:00.900
Signet ring your cord and your staff.

1018
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.700
So get into your went into her and she can see now Judah finds

1019
00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.900
out. She's pregnant and gets mad.

1020
00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.100
Says, all right, let's you know put her to death.

1021
00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.400
And Tamar says fine.

1022
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.400
But before you kill me, you should know the man

1023
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.400
who got me pregnant owns this ring this

1024
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.200
chord and this staff and then she pulls all that

1025
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:26.100
stuff out and judah's like oh, that was me. Never mind and

1026
00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.200
Tamar Bears, two sons

1027
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.500
at the end of this chapter

1028
00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.000
Perez

1029
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.700
and Zara

1030
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.400
now Zara

1031
00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.200
Zara means seed

1032
00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.600
that's the word for seed.

1033
00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.900
And he's got a Scarlet thread tied around his arm.

1034
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:53.900
But he's not the seed.

1035
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.300
Perez the line through him the Messiah

1036
00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.200
comes the point though is this

1037
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.000
Joseph looks like the seed.

1038
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.400
He's wise.

1039
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:08.900
He obeys he rules. He's fruitful.

1040
00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:11.600
He's clothed in the image of the king receives

1041
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:12.400
a wife from the King.

1042
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.700
But he's not the seed. He's not in Israel. He doesn't

1043
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.500
destroy the serpent and he's not the son

1044
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.400
of Judah or he's not the son of Jacob through

1045
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:25.300
whom the line of the seed passes. That's Judah and that's

1046
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.900
why judah's story is sitting here in the middle of Joseph's.

1047
00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:33.300
To remind us that God is faithful to

1048
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.500
his promises in the midst of our unfaithfulness. Judah is

1049
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.900
probably one of the worst people in the

1050
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.500
Book of Genesis, which is really saying something.

1051
00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:47.800
And yet here God is remaining faithful

1052
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.600
to his promises.

1053
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.100
Joseph is a picture of the new Adam but he's not

1054
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:57.300
the new Adam. We're still waiting on this son of

1055
00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:58.000
Zara.

1056
00:56:58.900 --> 00:56:59.100
now

1057
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:05.000
when we get to the end of Genesis, everybody dies spoiler

1058
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.200
alert.

1059
00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:09.500
But Judah Jacob

1060
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.900
sorry blesses his sons and into Judah.

1061
00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.500
He says in verse 9 of chapter. 49 Judah

1062
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.300
is Alliance Cub from the

1063
00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:20.300
prey or sorry verse eight Judah your brother shall praise

1064
00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.200
you your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies. Your Father's son. Shall

1065
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.300
bow down before you Judah is Alliance come from

1066
00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.600
the prey my son you have gone up. He's stoop down. He crouches a

1067
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.800
line as a lioness Who Dares Rouse him the scepter shall

1068
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.400
not depart from Judah nor the ruler staff

1069
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.900
from between his feet until tribute comes to him and to

1070
00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:41.600
him shall be The Obedience of his

1071
00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:45.200
peoples of the peoples binding

1072

is full of the vine is donkey's Colt to the

1073
00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:50.200
choice fine. He has washed his garments and wine and his vest here

1074
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.700
in the blood of grapes. His eyes are darker than Wine and his teeth.

1075
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.200
Wider than milk. That's Song of Solomon by

1076
00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.300
the way, so Judah here.

1077
00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:02.600
Is identified as the line of the seed this this language about

1078
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.900
the scepter and ruling Etc. He's going to have dominion over

1079
00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:06.300
the Earth.

1080
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.400
What God has done through the Book of Genesis is what

1081
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:11.800
he says.

1082
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:15.700
What Joseph says to his brothers?

1083
00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:19.600
in chapter 50

1084
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:22.100
verse 20

1085
00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.000
as for you

1086
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:27.100
Adam

1087
00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:32.300
Kane lamech NOAA Abraham

1088
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:34.500
Isaac Jacob

1089
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:35.800
Judah

1090
00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:40.300
us

1091
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.000
as for you

1092
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:47.900
as for me

1093
00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.200
we all mean evil against God.

1094
00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:57.500
apart from the grace of Christ

1095
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:02.200
But God meant it uses it for good.

1096
00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.400
To bring it about that many people should be kept alive as they are today.

1097
00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:08.800
in the midst of

1098
00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:10.200
Adam

1099
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.900
Abraham judah's faithlessness

1100
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.600
God is faithful because

1101
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:21.500
He's bringing about the salvation of many.

1102
00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.000
Through his faithfulness.

1103
00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.100
That's the message of Genesis really the message the Old Testament.

1104
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.100
We're still searching for the seed at the end. We haven't found him yet.

1105
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.200
Okay, so that search isn't over.

1106
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.400
But what we've seen in Genesis is a pattern for the rest of

1107
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.300
the Old Testament.

1108
00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:43.500
In Genesis 1 and 2 we saw the pattern.

1109
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.400
Of God's kingdom. This is from a guy named Vaughn Roberts

1110
00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:50.200
who wrote a good book called God's big picture if you want to check that out.

1111
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:55.300
He says that Genesis 1 and 2 is the pattern of

1112
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.100
God's Kingdom.

1113
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.900
In Genesis 3 we see that God's kingdom is

1114
01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.800
broken by sin.

1115
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.600
But Genesis 4 through 50 is

1116
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.500
the promise of God's faithfulness to bring about the kingdom

1117
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.000
in spite of our unfaithfulness. We're still waiting at the

1118
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:15.100
end.

1119
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.800
Okay, so I'm going to take the last few minutes that I have and

1120
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.300
just mention.

1121
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.500
Also the next book Exodus and what

1122
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.800
I want to do is talk about the Exodus event because these

1123
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.500
two things go together what God promises to Abraham

1124
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.100
and then how God is going to accomplish it in The

1125
01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:33.500
Exodus.

1126
01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.900
These two things go together and the next week.

1127
01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.200
Maybe we'll make it.

1128
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.200
Some at some point in the New Testament.

1129
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.500
I don't know but what I want you to hear

1130
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.000
as we wrap up for a few

1131
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.200
minutes is what God is going

1132
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:51.400
to do.

1133
01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.300
Is found in the promises day Abraham.

1134
01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:57.500
How he is going to do that.

1135
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.800
Is pictured in The Exodus?

1136
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.800
Okay, so what God is going to do he's going to

1137
01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.500
he's going to restore what Adam lost.

1138
01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.400
He's going to redeem his people so their fruitful so

1139
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.100
they can rule obey care for his place.

1140
01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:18.100
He's gonna do that through the seed of woman. How is he going to do that? We haven't

1141
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:18.700
really seen that yet.

1142
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.600
How is God going to do this we've gotten hints.

1143
01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.600
We got a hint in Genesis 3.

1144
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.500
with the sacrificial

1145
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.100
skins that Adam and Eve or we got a hint in Genesis

1146
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:33.400
6 when God calls Noah

1147
01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.900
to build an ark and he puts a Remnant on the ark to save them. He he

1148
01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.300
judges the world but he saves a

1149
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.900
Remnant but how is he going to do that?

1150
01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.000
Exodus is the answer that question 400 years

1151
01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:48.200
after Joseph dies Pharaoh doesn't remember

1152
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:48.600
Joseph.

1153
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.500
And enslaves the Egyptians now there's a lot of detail here

1154
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:57.000
that I really wish that we could go through for instance. Moses's

1155
01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.200
little basket that he's put

1156
01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:01.700
in to save him from the pharaoh's decree

1157
01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.200
that all the male children will be killed.

1158
01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.900
Which by the way has the gospel of Matthew start?

1159
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.300
Here it says kill all the male. Children Moses is a little

1160
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.600
basket. It says it's made of a product called

1161
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.000
bitumen and pitch.

1162
01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.700
And that's the same thing that Noah uses to build the ark.

1163
01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.400
so here's Moses comparing himself to Noah, which is

1164
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.400
a little bit pretentious but whatever so

1165
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.800
God calls Moses to be his

1166
01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.600
spokesman his Prophet to this

1167
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.500
evil King.

1168
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.500
If you were to study Egyptian religion

1169
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.700
and the place of the Pharaoh and

1170
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.300
and all their gods you would you would

1171
01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.200
know that the Pharaoh was kind of a representation of

1172
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.400
the Divine to the Egyptians.

1173
01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.300
And so what's happening is that Moses the representative of

1174
01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.200
Yahweh. The one true God.

1175
01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.100
Is going to Pharaoh the representation of these idolatrous

1176
01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.000
false gods.

1177
01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.600
And it's a Clash.

1178
01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.500
It's a clash between the one true God.

1179
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.700
and our false gods

1180
01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.000
It's a clash really.

1181
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.000
between

1182
01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.900
the god of the Bible the only true God

1183
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.700
and idolatry

1184
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.200
everything else

1185
01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.600
And how does God rescue his people from the bondage

1186
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.100
they are in?

1187
01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.300
to this representation of idolatry

1188
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.600
How does God rescue his people?

1189
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:37.300
He sends.

1190
01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.400
plagues

1191
01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.300
and if you study The Exodus event, you'll know

1192
01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.600
that each of those 10 plagues is an attack on one

1193
01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.600
of the Egyptian gods.

1194
01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.500
To say Yahweh is more powerful than you.

1195
01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.500
And we get through eight of them.

1196
01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.000
And then there's the ninth plague which is Darkness.

1197
01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.800
And then the tenth plague is what?

1198
01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.500
What's the 10th plague in Texas?

1199
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.800
death of the firstborn son

1200
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.300
Here's how God is going to rescue his people.

1201
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.500
through miraculous signs that ends in darkness and

1202
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.200
the death of the firstborn son and only those who are

1203
01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:18.500
what

1204
01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.100
covered by the blood of the Lamb

1205
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:23.900
will be spared.

1206
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.000
How is God going to save his people?

1207
01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:33.500
How is God going to restore? What Adam lost? How is

1208
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.200
he going to reverse the curse of Adam? How is he going to redeem the

1209
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.800
world from this bondage to sin?

1210
01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.100
Through victory over his enemies that happens in the

1211
01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.300
death of the firstborn son and the blood of the Lamb.

1212
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.900
That's how God is going to do it.

1213
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:54.100
And after he rescues them, where does he take him? He takes

1214
01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.500
them through the waters of the Red Sea.

1215
01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.600
Towards supposed to be into the Promised Land.

1216
01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.700
Listen, that's a picture of salvation.

1217
01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.300
How is God going to rescue his people through the death

1218
01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.300
of the firstborn son and the blood of the Lamb?

1219
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.400
What happens when Jesus dies Darkness?

1220
01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.500
death

1221
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:16.900
blood

1222
01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.500
Redemption

1223
01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.500
How do we enter into his place his kingdom

1224
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.700
through the waters of baptism? This is always been

1225
01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.200
how God is going to rescue his people.

1226
01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.000
This is always been the plan for what God is going to

1227
01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:36.000
do. No. Nobody should have been surprised when

1228
01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.200
Jesus shows up and says, hey everybody.

1229
01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.300
I'm gonna die.

1230
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.900
That's been the plan all along.

1231
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.700
God pictures it for us in The Exodus. That's

1232
01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:50.000
how God is going to save his people he's going to

1233
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.400
Gain, victory over his enemies through death of the firstborn son the

1234
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.600
blood of the lamb and he's gonna bring them out of bondage and into

1235
01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.700
his place to live with them forever.

1236
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.600
So I have made a lot of promises

1237
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.400
about where we'll get in the coming weeks.

1238
01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:09.300
And even tonight I made a lot of promises so I'm not going to make any more

1239
01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.000
promises. I'll be here next week. I think unless the

1240
01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:12.400
weather is bad.

1241
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.100
Let's all pray that it's not and we'll get somewhere in the Bible.

1242
01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:19.100
How about that? Is that fair? All right. Thank you all very much. Let me pray

1243
01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.600
for us and we'll be done God. Thank you so much for your word. We

1244
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.000
thank you that you have given it to us as bread.

1245
01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:27.900
to eat

1246
01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:33.900
as Manna From Heaven Lord that you sustain us.

1247
01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.300
You nourish Us by the power of your word

1248
01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.100
that is.

1249
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.600
inspired by your Holy Spirit and that testifies

1250
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.200
from page to page from Genesis 1 to revelation

1251
01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.700
22 to your son Jesus.

1252
01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:53.500
Or we thank you for sending your son. We thank

1253
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.300
you that you have redeemed Us by the blood of the Lamb the

1254
01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:57.700
death of your firstborn, son.

1255
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.600
And we pray Lord that we would walk in newness of

1256
01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:01.700
life.

1257
01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.300
That you've given to us through him and by your

1258
01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:05.400
spirit.

1259
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.300
And we ask an in Christ's name.

1260
01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.100
amen, I'm

1261
01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.000
let me know if you have questions.
