00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:02.005
Hello, my name's Trevor Nall.

2
00:00:02.725 --> 00:00:04.165
I am married to Cheryl Nall,

3
00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:08.365
and we have four children, Paige, Seth, Anna, and Olivia.

4
00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:12.085
We've been at Henderson Hills since 2008 when we moved

5
00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:14.045
to Edmond from Owosso, Oklahoma.

6
00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:17.765
And, uh, we have enjoyed every moment of it.

7
00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:21.805
It's been a season of healing, it's been a season

8
00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:24.805
of growing, and it has been a season of serving

9
00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:28.125
and caring, uh, for the ones that are closest to us.

10
00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:32.765
I wanted to give you a little bit of history, uh, for me

11
00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:35.805
and tell you the testimony of what God has done

12
00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:39.765
and is doing in my life and in our family's life.

13
00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.485
My family's from southwestern Oklahoma.

14
00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:45.725
Originally my father from Sentinel, Oklahoma,

15
00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:46.845
my mother from Altus.

16
00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:50.885
I was born in Lawton, raised all over western Oklahoma,

17
00:00:50.955 --> 00:00:52.885
from Lawton to Ponca City

18
00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:55.525
and Ponca City back to Lawton, to Oklahoma City,

19
00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:57.045
and eventually,

20
00:00:57.445 --> 00:00:59.205
ultimately graduated from Woodward High School.

21
00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:03.325
Um, I have a little bit of a running joke.

22
00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:06.445
I went to six different elementary schools in seven years,

23
00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:09.845
and, uh, no, I, I did not get kicked out of any of them.

24
00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:13.125
It so happened that my father was in community banking

25
00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:16.565
and, uh, if you're in community banking, you know

26
00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:19.365
that sooner or later you get promoted up to a position

27
00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:22.605
where the person in the seat ahead of you, in

28
00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:24.445
that other position that you might get,

29
00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:26.085
has their name on the building.

30
00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:29.205
And in those cases, when you get the next

31
00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:32.405
position professionally in community banking, you get

32
00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:33.565
to move to a new bank.

33
00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:38.165
And we did so frequently, uh, gave me a great appreciation

34
00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:43.205
for new places and new people gave me an ability to, uh,

35
00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:46.925
meet and, uh, be acquainted with a great deal of people.

36
00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:50.285
Um, and I very much appreciate the experience

37
00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:51.725
that I had from that

38
00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:55.655
and have from that all that time

39
00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:56.935
and all those different places.

40
00:01:57.395 --> 00:02:00.375
Um, my parents were diligent to raise my brother

41
00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:04.015
and I in the church, uh, from Lawton at First Baptist

42
00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:05.975
to Second Baptist in Ponca.

43
00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:08.095
And then once we got to Oklahoma City,

44
00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:09.615
to Highland Hills Baptist Church

45
00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:13.815
and on, we were in church every Sunday morning,

46
00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:16.615
every Sunday evening, every Wednesday evening.

47
00:02:17.395 --> 00:02:21.815
And, um, that is where God began to change

48
00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:26.475
me, to teach me about him, to let me know who he is.

49
00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:29.995
Um, it wasn't until Hinders,

50
00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:34.075
or sorry, until Highland Hills that, uh, I came

51
00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:38.515
to know the Lord, though, uh, we at that point were getting

52
00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:41.235
to go to Music makers, which was a program

53
00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:44.355
that the Southern Baptist had at Falls Creek

54
00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:45.795
for younger children.

55
00:02:46.015 --> 00:02:49.715
It wasn't Falls Creek as the, uh, youth might call it,

56
00:02:49.975 --> 00:02:52.995
but it was music makers where, uh, hundreds of kids

57
00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.595
around the state would gather together for a week

58
00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:56.915
and we would learn music

59
00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:00.565
and then we would be, uh, bust to Oklahoma City,

60
00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:02.045
to the Cox Convention Center

61
00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:05.885
where we would share the gospel news in music

62
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.445
before our parents and friends

63
00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:11.325
and family, uh, that came to pick us up from camp that week.

64
00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:14.355
And it was at Music Makers while I was at Highland Hills,

65
00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:17.675
that I knew that I needed a savior.

66
00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.855
Um, that's a difficult thing

67
00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:24.185
because all my life to that point,

68
00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:26.025
I'd been told that I was a good boy.

69
00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:28.105
And what we know is

70
00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:31.465
that good boys have a very difficult time understanding

71
00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:33.625
that they're not really good

72
00:03:34.245 --> 00:03:37.225
and they need something more than who they are.

73
00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:41.595
What we know is that the most difficult person

74
00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:44.875
to be saved is the person that doesn't believe

75
00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:46.635
that they need to be saved.

76
00:03:47.605 --> 00:03:51.145
But it was at music makers at Falls Creek that God

77
00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:56.125
touched me to know that I needed a savior.

78
00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:01.855
However, when I compared what was in my heart

79
00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:03.695
and motives, I knew I couldn't choose him.

80
00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:07.775
So he had to do a work in me, something I didn't understand.

81
00:04:07.835 --> 00:04:12.215
For many, many years later, we went from Highland Hills

82
00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:13.815
to Spring Creek Baptist.

83
00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:15.855
In Northern Northwest OKC.

84
00:04:16.275 --> 00:04:19.535
We went from there to Cherokee Hills Baptist Church in, uh,

85
00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:22.495
war Acres, and then on to First Baptist Church.

86
00:04:23.315 --> 00:04:25.815
Um, at Cherokee Hills, though, is

87
00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:29.215
where I was first really confronted with the fact that, uh,

88
00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:31.455
what I knew of God was limited.

89
00:04:32.215 --> 00:04:34.375
I had peers and older kids

90
00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:36.535
that were in our youth group at the time

91
00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:41.535
that really had known the deeper truths of the Lord,

92
00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:43.895
and they were striving and seeking

93
00:04:44.235 --> 00:04:46.655
and abiding in him to know more.

94
00:04:47.565 --> 00:04:52.195
It was a great example for me, uh, on our move to Woodward,

95
00:04:52.295 --> 00:04:53.395
that's where I first met.

96
00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:57.035
Cheryl, uh, met her at church at First Baptist.

97
00:04:57.495 --> 00:04:59.715
My family was moving there from Oklahoma City.

98
00:04:59.815 --> 00:05:03.515
Her family was coming to First Baptist Woodward from Fargo,

99
00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:05.955
Oklahoma, where they had been at the Methodist Church

100
00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:07.115
for a number of years before.

101
00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:11.115
And we were both new at the same time.

102
00:05:12.415 --> 00:05:14.955
And that's where we became high school sweethearts.

103
00:05:15.455 --> 00:05:16.915
And I got to marry her later

104
00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:19.075
after we were finishing our college

105
00:05:19.075 --> 00:05:20.595
degrees at Oklahoma State.

106
00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:26.345
Um, it was also at First Baptist Church where, uh,

107
00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:28.145
there was a model of ministry

108
00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:30.305
and a model of servanthood by one

109
00:05:30.305 --> 00:05:33.225
or two people in the church that really, um,

110
00:05:33.555 --> 00:05:35.865
solidified a calling for both Cheryl

111
00:05:35.925 --> 00:05:37.785
and I to serve in the church.

112
00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:42.835
And we've done so ever since from there to Stillwater,

113
00:05:43.335 --> 00:05:46.475
uh, where we were at First Baptist Church for a number

114
00:05:46.475 --> 00:05:48.315
of years in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

115
00:05:49.135 --> 00:05:51.595
But there was another thing that happened in Stillwater

116
00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:53.075
that was a conviction for me.

117
00:05:53.775 --> 00:05:56.635
It was a conviction that even though I knew

118
00:05:56.745 --> 00:05:58.685
that there were those that were striving

119
00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:02.205
and really seeking to know the Lord in a deeper way,

120
00:06:02.715 --> 00:06:04.285
that I didn't yet know

121
00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:06.205
and appreciate the Lord in a way

122
00:06:06.205 --> 00:06:09.325
that I could adequately articulate my faith in him.

123
00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:14.275
Um, I wanted to go to Countryside Baptist Church,

124
00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:19.285
little church just to the southwest of town in Stillwater.

125
00:06:19.825 --> 00:06:22.605
Um, but it was known for having elders.

126
00:06:22.605 --> 00:06:24.925
It was known for having a solid, uh,

127
00:06:24.925 --> 00:06:26.965
theological, uh, background.

128
00:06:27.385 --> 00:06:30.125
But one of the things I knew about joining, uh,

129
00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:34.445
countryside at the time was that their elders required that

130
00:06:34.605 --> 00:06:37.685
for membership, you were able to come to the elders

131
00:06:37.685 --> 00:06:40.165
and articulate your faith and tell them what you believed.

132
00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:43.245
And I, I was afraid I couldn't do it.

133
00:06:43.765 --> 00:06:44.765
I knew I couldn't do it.

134
00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:49.265
And it wasn't until several years later, uh, when we got

135
00:06:49.265 --> 00:06:52.665
to Owosso after we got married, uh, that

136
00:06:53.285 --> 00:06:56.645
the Lord grew in me, the ability

137
00:06:56.745 --> 00:06:59.245
to know him in that deeper way.

138
00:07:00.335 --> 00:07:05.315
Um, it wasn't until then that I knew, uh, how

139
00:07:05.315 --> 00:07:08.515
to study the Bible, how to know about who he is,

140
00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:12.135
but I'll tell you in just a minute

141
00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:14.735
why it happened at Bethel.

142
00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:16.695
And one of the things that I love

143
00:07:17.285 --> 00:07:19.615
that I see still at Henderson Hills today,

144
00:07:21.345 --> 00:07:24.685
but at Bethel, we, that was the point that Cheryl

145
00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:28.195
and I first had our children, uh, Paige, Seth

146
00:07:28.195 --> 00:07:30.515
and Anna were all three born while we were at

147
00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:32.315
Bethel in Owosso.

148
00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:36.205
And when we first got pregnant, unfortunately,

149
00:07:36.225 --> 00:07:38.965
our first pregnancy was, uh, a miscarriage

150
00:07:39.705 --> 00:07:41.885
and we didn't ever get to meet that child.

151
00:07:42.915 --> 00:07:45.495
But one of the things that happened during

152
00:07:45.495 --> 00:07:47.575
that time period was I was convicted

153
00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:49.095
by Deuteronomy Chapter six.

154
00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:54.515
I was convicted by the fact again, that I had a fear

155
00:07:54.665 --> 00:07:59.495
that I was incapable of doing what Deuteronomy chapter six

156
00:08:00.005 --> 00:08:02.175
told me to do, that I was

157
00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:04.375
to teach while I was walking in the way.

158
00:08:04.555 --> 00:08:06.935
And while we were sitting down and while we were eating

159
00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:10.535
and while we were working, and I was needed to be able

160
00:08:10.535 --> 00:08:13.775
to lead my family, to know the Lord

161
00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:17.495
and to grow deeper in him, to serve him well,

162
00:08:17.495 --> 00:08:21.405
and to minister to others, I, I knew I couldn't do it.

163
00:08:22.615 --> 00:08:24.315
But one of the things that we had benefit

164
00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:28.675
of while we were at Bethel Baptist Church was we had a group

165
00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.595
of people, both men

166
00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:34.615
and women that invested themselves in us,

167
00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:38.175
that came alongside us and put their arm around us,

168
00:08:38.315 --> 00:08:39.335
and they cared for us.

169
00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:41.615
And they taught us, and they challenged us.

170
00:08:42.235 --> 00:08:47.215
Uh, they were great community for us at that point in time.

171
00:08:47.315 --> 00:08:48.855
We were about four, four

172
00:08:48.855 --> 00:08:51.575
and a half hours away from all of our family, uh,

173
00:08:51.795 --> 00:08:53.895
not very far in today's standards,

174
00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:56.485
but still, it was far enough that the influence

175
00:08:56.485 --> 00:08:58.605
that we had on a daily basis was not

176
00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:00.245
so greatly our parents any longer,

177
00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:04.115
but it was these people at Bethel Baptist Church

178
00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:05.715
that invested in us in that way.

179
00:09:06.175 --> 00:09:10.315
It was there that I knew why, that I knew inside

180
00:09:10.315 --> 00:09:12.235
that I could not choose God.

181
00:09:13.015 --> 00:09:16.195
Why, like Psalm 14, one through three that says,

182
00:09:16.295 --> 00:09:18.475
the fool says in his heart, there is no God.

183
00:09:19.745 --> 00:09:22.155
They are corrupt. They do abominable deeds.

184
00:09:22.605 --> 00:09:24.155
There is none who does good.

185
00:09:25.095 --> 00:09:27.795
The Lord looks down from heaven on the children of man

186
00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:32.115
to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.

187
00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:35.535
They have all turned aside together.

188
00:09:36.005 --> 00:09:39.135
They have become corrupt. There is none who does good.

189
00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:44.085
No, not one in Jeremiah 17, nine that says,

190
00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:45.845
the heart is deceitful above all things

191
00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:48.165
and desperately wicked who can know it.

192
00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:53.005
And finally, in Ephesians chapter two, where the, uh,

193
00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:55.765
Paul starts the beginning of that chapter and says,

194
00:09:56.145 --> 00:09:58.885
and you were dead in the trespasses

195
00:09:58.945 --> 00:10:02.285
and sins in which you once walked following the course

196
00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:05.815
of this world, I had been dead.

197
00:10:06.535 --> 00:10:08.535
I could not raise myself back to life.

198
00:10:08.595 --> 00:10:11.935
But now I knew in the scriptures why,

199
00:10:12.735 --> 00:10:16.035
and I understood my assessment of good,

200
00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:18.355
couldn't be people telling me that I was a good boy anymore.

201
00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:21.515
My assessment of good had to be the standard of God,

202
00:10:21.925 --> 00:10:22.995
which was much higher.

203
00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:29.915
It was also in Ephesians just a little bit later, uh,

204
00:10:30.015 --> 00:10:34.155
in chapter two, that I found out that for by grace,

205
00:10:34.255 --> 00:10:36.275
you have been saved through faith.

206
00:10:36.575 --> 00:10:38.555
And this is not your own doing,

207
00:10:39.015 --> 00:10:41.115
but it is a gift of God, not of works,

208
00:10:41.715 --> 00:10:42.995
lest any man should boast.

209
00:10:43.965 --> 00:10:45.545
It wasn't something that I could work for,

210
00:10:45.565 --> 00:10:46.745
it wasn't something I could do.

211
00:10:46.805 --> 00:10:49.305
But God had given it to me as a gift.

212
00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:54.765
And it was at this point at Bethel that I realized

213
00:10:54.765 --> 00:10:56.845
what God had been doing in my life all along

214
00:10:57.855 --> 00:11:00.555
because I could remember

215
00:11:01.055 --> 00:11:04.315
and name people who had invested in me,

216
00:11:06.275 --> 00:11:08.525
my parents, Robert

217
00:11:08.525 --> 00:11:12.525
and Beverly Nall, my my in-Laws, uh, Roger and Judy Pruitt.

218
00:11:13.155 --> 00:11:15.175
Um, um, people like Greek

219
00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:20.135
and Denise s when we first came to Bethel, Cheryl

220
00:11:20.155 --> 00:11:24.075
and I first came that day and we were greeted

221
00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:27.355
and we were told where a community group was, uh,

222
00:11:27.355 --> 00:11:28.715
Sunday School, I believe is

223
00:11:28.715 --> 00:11:29.875
what we called them back in that day.

224
00:11:30.495 --> 00:11:34.195
But, uh, we were led up to a stairwell at the back

225
00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:37.315
of the building, uh, kind of over the pastor's offices

226
00:11:37.735 --> 00:11:39.675
and looked a little shady at first.

227
00:11:39.775 --> 00:11:42.475
But as we got up to the top of the stairs, I was greeted

228
00:11:42.475 --> 00:11:45.355
by a familiar face, uh, Denise Vadas,

229
00:11:45.355 --> 00:11:49.035
who had been a leader in the state student council.

230
00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:51.675
And I had known her for a number of years,

231
00:11:52.335 --> 00:11:54.525
not knowing at all that she lived in Owosso,

232
00:11:54.545 --> 00:11:56.885
not knowing at all that she went to Bethel Baptist Church,

233
00:11:56.945 --> 00:11:58.165
but finding out that she

234
00:11:58.165 --> 00:12:02.405
and her husband Greek had led a Sunday school class

235
00:12:03.105 --> 00:12:05.565
in the upstairs above the church offices

236
00:12:05.945 --> 00:12:07.085
for a number of years before.

237
00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:10.515
And we walked in, we were greeted with a face

238
00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:13.255
that was kind and loving.

239
00:12:15.675 --> 00:12:18.775
Um, we were also taught by Dr. Mrs. Cook.

240
00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:22.095
We're also taught and led by Bill and Mary Stinson.

241
00:12:22.595 --> 00:12:25.775
And we were taught and challenged by great deep Bible

242
00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:29.375
teaching of a man, um, named Jim Wheeler.

243
00:12:31.175 --> 00:12:34.555
It was during that time that we also found close peers, uh,

244
00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:36.395
that some of whom, uh,

245
00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:39.035
faithfully serve at Henderson Hills today.

246
00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:42.235
Folks like Brian and Kathy Topping, uh, Darren

247
00:12:42.255 --> 00:12:45.075
and Christie Lawson, Steven Elisa, er, uh,

248
00:12:45.105 --> 00:12:46.475
Cameron and Jennifer Turner.

249
00:12:46.475 --> 00:12:48.835
Cameron currently is an elder at Redemption

250
00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:50.075
Church here in Edmond.

251
00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:52.275
Uh, great friends of ours, Greg

252
00:12:52.275 --> 00:12:54.515
and Shelly Cantrell, even Eric

253
00:12:54.575 --> 00:12:57.035
and Courtney Harp that serve alongside

254
00:12:57.175 --> 00:13:00.395
and with us in the college and young adult ministry

255
00:13:00.935 --> 00:13:03.315
and are active in missions around the world.

256
00:13:03.805 --> 00:13:05.115
These are just to name a few.

257
00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:10.315
These men and their wives played an instrumental part in

258
00:13:10.635 --> 00:13:13.885
encouraging and challenging me, my knowledge

259
00:13:14.025 --> 00:13:15.365
and understanding of God.

260
00:13:16.985 --> 00:13:20.135
These were the first who personally committed

261
00:13:20.315 --> 00:13:23.095
to seeking the Lord and his righteousness,

262
00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:25.885
and then leading me.

263
00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:29.985
They were great examples, carefully committed

264
00:13:29.985 --> 00:13:33.305
and devoted to exhibiting what faith

265
00:13:33.485 --> 00:13:34.825
and ministry looks like.

266
00:13:37.495 --> 00:13:40.305
This was also my first experience with being voluntold.

267
00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:45.065
Uh, bill Stinson, uh, on Wednesday night had come to me.

268
00:13:45.445 --> 00:13:47.625
We met in a back hallway at the church

269
00:13:47.845 --> 00:13:49.705
as I was walking in to eat dinner.

270
00:13:50.285 --> 00:13:52.145
And while I was walking in to eat dinner,

271
00:13:52.245 --> 00:13:55.385
he asked if I would consider, uh, leading the third

272
00:13:55.405 --> 00:13:59.465
and fourth grade Boys Awana class, uh, on Wednesday nights.

273
00:14:00.415 --> 00:14:03.595
And I said, bill, I said, um, I, I don't think that

274
00:14:03.595 --> 00:14:04.675
that's necessarily for me,

275
00:14:04.675 --> 00:14:08.795
but I will pray that, uh, God will tell me if

276
00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:10.115
that's a calling for me or not.

277
00:14:11.415 --> 00:14:12.985
Another week or two went by

278
00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:16.745
and Bill again, uh, found me in that same hallway at

279
00:14:16.745 --> 00:14:18.905
that same time as I was walking to

280
00:14:18.905 --> 00:14:20.505
that same meal on Wednesday night.

281
00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:23.945
And Bill said, Hey, have you been praying about that?

282
00:14:24.015 --> 00:14:26.385
What do you think? I'd love to get you, uh,

283
00:14:26.385 --> 00:14:27.385
leading this class?

284
00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:30.105
And I said, bill, I'm, I'm still praying about it.

285
00:14:30.105 --> 00:14:32.585
I'm just not convinced that that is for me.

286
00:14:33.745 --> 00:14:36.825
A couple weeks later, bill, uh, met me in that same hallway

287
00:14:37.045 --> 00:14:39.585
for that same dinner and asked me that same question,

288
00:14:39.965 --> 00:14:41.545
but he asked it in a different way this time.

289
00:14:41.605 --> 00:14:46.305
He asked it by handing me and I want shirt and Awana books,

290
00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:49.185
and telling me what time that I needed to be at

291
00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:51.085
that Awana class to lead it,

292
00:14:51.105 --> 00:14:54.965
and how long it would take for the Awana class that year.

293
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.425
That was a great thing for me

294
00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:04.325
because what it did was it actually identified a gifting

295
00:15:04.595 --> 00:15:07.925
that I have to teach and to lead others.

296
00:15:08.665 --> 00:15:12.125
Um, something that was initially kind of seen in a third

297
00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:14.965
and fourth grade boys, and then ultimately in the youth at

298
00:15:15.185 --> 00:15:16.245
Bethel Baptist Church.

299
00:15:16.345 --> 00:15:18.645
And then here as we've taught youth

300
00:15:18.825 --> 00:15:21.485
and childrens at Hillside Kids, and as we teach

301
00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:22.765
and lead a college

302
00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:26.405
and young adult group in our home on Monday nights,

303
00:15:27.305 --> 00:15:30.605
we still continue to follow that calling

304
00:15:30.605 --> 00:15:32.685
that Bill Stinson identified in us.

305
00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:35.695
And I very much appreciate that.

306
00:15:36.995 --> 00:15:40.775
Um, all this time, God supplied opportunity for us

307
00:15:40.835 --> 00:15:42.375
to know more about him, to teach

308
00:15:42.395 --> 00:15:44.495
and lead others, uh, in his ways.

309
00:15:45.355 --> 00:15:47.655
Um, here today, Cheryl

310
00:15:47.675 --> 00:15:51.215
and I continue, uh, to be faithful to that commitment

311
00:15:51.215 --> 00:15:52.615
that we made to serve

312
00:15:52.835 --> 00:15:55.455
and to minister at the churches that we were at.

313
00:15:56.135 --> 00:15:58.435
Uh, we are greeters, uh,

314
00:15:58.495 --> 00:16:01.035
and connectors on Sunday morning in the gathering.

315
00:16:01.655 --> 00:16:05.115
We are, uh, storytellers and hillside kids,

316
00:16:05.655 --> 00:16:08.195
and we have that college and young adult group in our home.

317
00:16:08.855 --> 00:16:11.155
And then I'm also a deacon at our church.

318
00:16:11.315 --> 00:16:12.835
I have been since 2012

319
00:16:12.895 --> 00:16:16.635
and been able to serve alongside a great number of men, uh,

320
00:16:16.655 --> 00:16:19.715
who I, uh, really, really value their love

321
00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:22.635
and, uh, ministries, uh, to our church as well.

322
00:16:24.175 --> 00:16:26.435
Um, I need to round out this story though,

323
00:16:26.435 --> 00:16:28.835
because I've shared a great deal about the number of fears

324
00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:30.755
that I've had and the, the challenges

325
00:16:31.055 --> 00:16:33.515
and, uh, convictions about, uh,

326
00:16:33.515 --> 00:16:35.595
what I didn't know at times past

327
00:16:36.885 --> 00:16:38.235
those children that I mentioned.

328
00:16:38.325 --> 00:16:40.915
Paige, uh, Seth, Anna, and Olivia.

329
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:45.555
Today, Paige is married, uh, to a man named Scott Manning,

330
00:16:45.895 --> 00:16:50.715
who is the countryside, uh, college, uh, young adult pastor.

331
00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:53.755
Uh, they have two children in Stillwater.

332
00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:56.795
Seth and his wife Devon live here in Edmond.

333
00:16:56.795 --> 00:16:59.875
And they're, uh, active at, uh, Bridgeway.

334
00:17:00.745 --> 00:17:05.595
Anna is now in Dallas and is at, uh, watermark

335
00:17:06.295 --> 00:17:08.795
and Olivia, uh, attending Oklahoma State.

336
00:17:08.895 --> 00:17:11.315
She still comes home almost every weekend

337
00:17:11.855 --> 00:17:14.075
to be right here at Henderson Hills.

338
00:17:15.565 --> 00:17:19.585
What I know from what God has done in my life is

339
00:17:19.655 --> 00:17:24.065
that despite my fear, despite my lack of knowledge

340
00:17:24.065 --> 00:17:25.985
and understanding when we first had children

341
00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:28.185
and all of the convictions

342
00:17:28.185 --> 00:17:32.505
that I had throughout my lifetime, God supplied

343
00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:35.305
and continues to supply all we need.

344
00:17:36.905 --> 00:17:38.805
He has never failed me.

345
00:17:40.095 --> 00:17:42.915
He has always been there

346
00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:47.075
and supplied even the things I didn't know I needed.

347
00:17:48.745 --> 00:17:52.285
And he will continue to do that as we seek

348
00:17:52.345 --> 00:17:55.165
to follow his calling in eldership.

349
00:17:57.345 --> 00:17:59.285
He has proven and continues to prove

350
00:17:59.285 --> 00:18:00.885
what Psalm 23 teaches us.

351
00:18:00.945 --> 00:18:05.105
All. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

352
00:18:05.605 --> 00:18:08.165
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

353
00:18:08.265 --> 00:18:12.565
He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul.

354
00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:17.665
He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

355
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.345
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

356
00:18:21.365 --> 00:18:24.665
of death, I will fear no evil for you are with me.

357
00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:28.615
You'll rod in your staff, they comfort me.

358
00:18:29.315 --> 00:18:32.495
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies,

359
00:18:33.035 --> 00:18:34.855
and you anoint my head with oil.

360
00:18:35.755 --> 00:18:37.215
My cup overflows.

361
00:18:38.395 --> 00:18:41.495
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days

362
00:18:41.515 --> 00:18:44.295
of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord

363
00:18:44.885 --> 00:18:45.375
forever.
