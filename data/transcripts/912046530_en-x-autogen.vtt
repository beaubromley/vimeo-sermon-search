1
00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:51.685
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:54.245
Would you please open your Bibles to Ephesians chapter two,

3
00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:56.805
Ephesians chapter two.

4
00:00:56.805 --> 00:00:58.005
We'll be there in just a minute.

5
00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:02.525
Uh, John and Emily are away

6
00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:04.485
enjoying a much needed break,

7
00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:08.605
and John will be back next week to continue our series.

8
00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:10.565
But today you're stuck with me.

9
00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:14.605
Uh, my name is Aaron Ferguson. I'm one of the elders here.

10
00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:18.365
It's a pleasure to serve you as an elder

11
00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:22.005
and, uh, if you are new with us today,

12
00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:23.565
thank you for being here.

13
00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:26.245
We have a place just in the lobby called New here

14
00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:28.045
and we would love to meet you

15
00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:30.365
and, uh, get to know that you are here today.

16
00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:35.005
Uh, the rest of you, I do not get this chance very often,

17
00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:38.205
and so let me just say on behalf of the Elder Council

18
00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:40.725
that uh, we are grateful for you.

19
00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:44.575
We are, uh, grateful for your faithful attendance

20
00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:47.215
and grateful for your faithful service.

21
00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:49.455
Many of you serve all across the campus

22
00:01:49.555 --> 00:01:50.575
in various ministries.

23
00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:54.615
Thank you. And thank you for your faithful giving

24
00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:57.935
and um, your faithful study of God's word.

25
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.215
It's my pleasure to lead

26
00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:02.495
that study this morning in Ephesians chapter two.

27
00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:06.785
Now, John, the last two weeks, uh,

28
00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:09.465
has preached in a very low chair

29
00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:13.185
and, uh, I am so grateful I don't have to do

30
00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:14.665
that today for a couple of reasons.

31
00:02:14.665 --> 00:02:16.665
Number one, I'm not cool enough to do that,

32
00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:21.625
but number two, I'm getting to the age where if I set

33
00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:23.065
that long, that low of the floor,

34
00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:24.545
I probably wouldn't be able to get up

35
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.545
and, uh, they'd have to carry me off the stage.

36
00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:30.185
And so that would be very embarrassing.

37
00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:31.545
So I'm glad I don't have to do that.

38
00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:36.105
And I'm getting to the age now where I, I used to be able

39
00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:39.065
to preach with a small piece of paper

40
00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:40.865
and I could read the fine print

41
00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:43.985
and uh, now I have this massive notebook

42
00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:48.105
with massive print in it and uh, I have to wear these.

43
00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:49.425
Anybody have to wear these.

44
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:52.665
Uh, I know a lot of you have been wearing these your whole

45
00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:54.265
life and I'm very sorry for that

46
00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:56.145
'cause these are no fun at all.

47
00:02:57.085 --> 00:03:01.405
Uh, Genesis chapter three, uh,

48
00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.405
Eve ate that fruit because it was good for the eyes.

49
00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:07.525
I think that was a lie. It was not good for the eyes at all.

50
00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:12.885
Uh, poor eyesight is part of the curse, I'm convinced.

51
00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:16.005
And uh, that's probably why I don't eat fruit either

52
00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:17.245
'cause it's part of the curse.

53
00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:22.365
But, uh, anyway, the good news about losing your eyesight is

54
00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:24.205
that I'm starting to, I think,

55
00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:27.005
get better looking in my old age as far

56
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:28.285
as I can tell in the mirror.

57
00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:33.065
Uh, so there are some benefits.

58
00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:37.425
We are in a series called First Things First,

59
00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:41.425
looking at essential doctrines of the Christian life, sort

60
00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:45.785
of those first tier, first level beliefs, the big rocks

61
00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:48.465
that we should all agree on.

62
00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:51.025
And uh, as I watched John last week,

63
00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:54.585
put these rocks in here, I leaned over to my wife

64
00:03:54.585 --> 00:03:56.665
and said, I hope there's room for my rock.

65
00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:01.185
Uh, and so I asked this morning to, for the rocks

66
00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:03.345
to be put in here before I preached,

67
00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:06.345
because I was afraid that I wouldn't stack them properly

68
00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:08.705
and my rock wouldn't fit in the jar like it's supposed to.

69
00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:12.025
So you could say that John's a little bolder than I am,

70
00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:16.585
but uh, I am not going to put these rocks in here,

71
00:04:17.325 --> 00:04:18.465
but I am gonna review.

72
00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:23.545
Uh, so far we've looked at five big rocks,

73
00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:26.265
big tear issues, uh,

74
00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:30.305
and we started with God's revelation,

75
00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:33.945
how he has revealed himself to us through Christ,

76
00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:36.465
through creation, through his word.

77
00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:39.145
We believe the Bible is God's word.

78
00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:41.545
And then we looked at week two, God's attributes.

79
00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:44.305
Who is God? What is he like?

80
00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:48.475
And then we looked at the person of the Trinity, the person

81
00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:50.955
of Christ, and then last week, humanity.

82
00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:55.835
Uh, who are we and why are we here? What are we like?

83
00:04:56.535 --> 00:04:59.635
And uh, I guess you could say we're off to a rocky start,

84
00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:01.315
but it's gonna get better today

85
00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:05.075
because we're doing the doctrine of salvation.

86
00:05:05.815 --> 00:05:10.515
So, uh, why is the doctrine of salvation a big rock

87
00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:13.975
that we need to spend a whole sermon on it?

88
00:05:14.765 --> 00:05:17.135
Well, it's really the heart of the gospel.

89
00:05:17.365 --> 00:05:19.815
It's the heart of the entire Bible.

90
00:05:19.955 --> 00:05:22.695
The message of the entire Bible from beginning to end is

91
00:05:23.235 --> 00:05:26.055
God redeeming, fallen people.

92
00:05:27.075 --> 00:05:30.615
And so when we talk salvation, we're really getting right

93
00:05:30.615 --> 00:05:33.735
to the heart of what God wants to say to us.

94
00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:38.335
And besides that, we answer some of life's big questions

95
00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:40.935
with the doctrine of salvation.

96
00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:44.575
Like, why am I here and, and what's wrong with me?

97
00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:47.455
And what can I do about it?

98
00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:50.855
Uh, how can I be made right with God again and,

99
00:05:51.515 --> 00:05:53.775
and what happens to me when I die?

100
00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:56.745
Now those are some big questions that the doctrine

101
00:05:56.745 --> 00:05:58.445
of salvation is going to answer.

102
00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:02.085
So this is a foundation stone, a big rock for sure,

103
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.445
and it's so big

104
00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:09.605
and intimidating that uh, we could spend a year

105
00:06:09.605 --> 00:06:10.965
of sermons on this doctrine.

106
00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:13.525
You understand? On Wednesday night, I'm going to try

107
00:06:13.525 --> 00:06:17.085
to go in a lot more deeply than I am this morning.

108
00:06:17.235 --> 00:06:20.325
This morning I'm gonna try to keep this very simple

109
00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:24.845
and I'm gonna do that by asking and answering six questions.

110
00:06:25.745 --> 00:06:29.765
So you'll see, uh, there on your notes the six questions,

111
00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:31.165
and I'm just gonna dive right in

112
00:06:31.705 --> 00:06:33.285
and begin to answer these questions.

113
00:06:33.425 --> 00:06:38.405
So what is salvation? What is salvation?

114
00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:42.205
The Greek word for salvation literally means to save

115
00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:47.005
or to rescue, to save or to rescue.

116
00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:52.565
Uh, Noah Webster's definition of salvation is the act

117
00:06:52.585 --> 00:06:57.165
of saving or preserving someone from danger or destruction.

118
00:06:58.555 --> 00:07:00.575
The act of saving or preserving someone

119
00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:03.135
from danger or destruction.

120
00:07:04.585 --> 00:07:07.355
Okay, well that caused me to ask five more questions.

121
00:07:08.175 --> 00:07:13.075
Uh, who is it that needs to be saved? Who needs to be saved?

122
00:07:13.655 --> 00:07:15.035
Why do we need to be saved?

123
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.965
Who is it that does the saving?

124
00:07:21.025 --> 00:07:25.245
How are we saved and what are the benefits of being saved?

125
00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:30.565
All five questions can be answered in our key passage today.

126
00:07:31.315 --> 00:07:33.725
Ephesians chapter two verses one through 10.

127
00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:36.365
So would you join me there? Ephesians chapter two,

128
00:07:36.385 --> 00:07:37.925
verses one through 10.

129
00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:39.165
This is an incredible passage

130
00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:43.885
and the gospel is just richly described

131
00:07:44.745 --> 00:07:46.805
and I'm gonna try to make it as simple as I can.

132
00:07:48.265 --> 00:07:50.035
Ephesians chapter two, verse one,

133
00:07:51.335 --> 00:07:54.555
and you Christians, Paul's talking to Christians,

134
00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:58.115
you were dead in the trespasses

135
00:07:58.115 --> 00:08:01.855
and sins in which you once walked following the course

136
00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:04.855
of this world, following the prince of the power of the air,

137
00:08:05.555 --> 00:08:09.215
the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience,

138
00:08:10.105 --> 00:08:15.045
among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh,

139
00:08:15.845 --> 00:08:18.005
carrying out the desires of the body and the mind

140
00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:20.725
and were by nature, children

141
00:08:20.865 --> 00:08:23.205
of wrath like the rest of mankind.

142
00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:28.205
But God being rich in mercy and

143
00:08:28.205 --> 00:08:30.405
because of the great love with which he loved us

144
00:08:31.035 --> 00:08:33.725
even when we were dead in our trespasses,

145
00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:38.195
made us alive together with Christ by grace,

146
00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:42.585
have you been saved and raised us up with him

147
00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.585
and seeded us with him in the heavenly places

148
00:08:45.205 --> 00:08:46.505
in Christ Jesus.

149
00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:49.545
So that in the coming ages

150
00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:52.825
he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace

151
00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:56.155
and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

152
00:08:57.475 --> 00:09:00.135
For by grace have you been saved through faith.

153
00:09:01.155 --> 00:09:04.135
And this is not your own doing, it's the gift of God,

154
00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:08.055
not a result of work so that no one may boast

155
00:09:08.935 --> 00:09:12.675
for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus

156
00:09:12.735 --> 00:09:16.115
for good works, which God prepared beforehand

157
00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:17.955
that we should walk in them.

158
00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:20.915
Well, let's pray together. God, thank you

159
00:09:20.975 --> 00:09:22.035
so much for your word.

160
00:09:23.105 --> 00:09:25.255
Thank you for this passage on salvation.

161
00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:27.935
I pray now that you would help me to make it

162
00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:30.455
as clearly clear as I can pray

163
00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:32.505
that you would open our hearts

164
00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:35.105
and our minds to understand what it is you have done

165
00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:38.465
for us in this wonderful gift of salvation.

166
00:09:39.575 --> 00:09:41.785
It's in Christ name we pray. Amen.

167
00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:46.125
Well, let's answer that second question.

168
00:09:46.345 --> 00:09:48.645
Who is it that needs to be saved?

169
00:09:49.425 --> 00:09:50.685
Who is it that needs to be saved?

170
00:09:50.685 --> 00:09:52.285
Well find the answer in verse three.

171
00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:54.445
If you'll go back to verse three.

172
00:09:54.475 --> 00:09:56.925
Paul is speaking to Christians

173
00:09:57.705 --> 00:09:59.565
and he's describing our lives

174
00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:04.205
before salvation, that we all lived

175
00:10:05.265 --> 00:10:08.005
in a way that displeased God, read this verse with me again.

176
00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:11.325
Among whom we Christians all

177
00:10:11.835 --> 00:10:14.285
once lived in the passions of our flesh,

178
00:10:15.525 --> 00:10:17.845
carrying out the desires of the body and the mind

179
00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:20.045
and were by nature children

180
00:10:20.105 --> 00:10:23.645
of wrath like the rest of mankind.

181
00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.165
If you like to underline, circle, highlight words,

182
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.725
encourage you to to underline, highlight,

183
00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:31.205
circle in verse three.

184
00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:35.885
We all, we all, Paul says, we all Christians

185
00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:40.485
included, used to live in a way that displeased God

186
00:10:40.945 --> 00:10:42.885
and then underline, highlight circle

187
00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.325
like the rest of mankind.

188
00:10:47.425 --> 00:10:51.235
All of us live in a way

189
00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:52.915
that displeases God.

190
00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:58.035
In other words, everyone needs to be saved.

191
00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:03.355
Salvation is for everyone.

192
00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:07.195
Everyone needs salvation. Without salvation, we are doomed.

193
00:11:08.575 --> 00:11:09.845
Which Paul is gonna go on

194
00:11:09.845 --> 00:11:11.805
to explain more here in just a minute.

195
00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:14.285
Why? Why do we need to be saved?

196
00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:16.485
Let's answer question number three.

197
00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:18.805
Why do we need to be saved?

198
00:11:19.515 --> 00:11:22.405
Paul describes what we are like before salvation.

199
00:11:22.985 --> 00:11:24.205
In verses one through three,

200
00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:25.685
lemme just read some of these statements.

201
00:11:26.175 --> 00:11:30.565
Verse one, he says, we are dead in our trespasses and sins.

202
00:11:31.175 --> 00:11:34.765
Verse two, we follow the prince of the power of the air.

203
00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:38.245
Also in verse two, we follow the course of this world.

204
00:11:38.985 --> 00:11:42.005
And then also in verse two, we are sons of disobedience.

205
00:11:42.665 --> 00:11:45.445
And then in verse three, we are children of wrath.

206
00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:49.565
Without salvation, our condition is hopeless.

207
00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:52.485
And what he's trying to show us is we are

208
00:11:53.565 --> 00:11:55.525
hopeless without salvation.

209
00:11:56.345 --> 00:11:58.405
So let me just for a a minute here,

210
00:11:58.475 --> 00:12:01.005
explain those five statements as best I can.

211
00:12:01.905 --> 00:12:05.445
Number one, we are dead in our trespasses and sins.

212
00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:09.985
Genesis chapter two, God tells Adam

213
00:12:10.005 --> 00:12:11.665
and Eve not to eat from a certain tree.

214
00:12:11.885 --> 00:12:13.465
But look, listen to verse 17.

215
00:12:14.165 --> 00:12:18.185
In the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.

216
00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:24.065
In the day that you disobey me, you will surely die.

217
00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:27.105
What God is doing there right at the beginning of our Bibles

218
00:12:27.765 --> 00:12:29.665
is establishing a principle.

219
00:12:31.055 --> 00:12:34.045
Death is a penalty for disobedience.

220
00:12:34.175 --> 00:12:36.445
Death is a penalty for sin.

221
00:12:38.155 --> 00:12:41.935
If you obey me, you live. If you disobey me, you die.

222
00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:43.855
And of course we know what happens.

223
00:12:44.855 --> 00:12:47.865
Adam and Eve disobey God, they rebel against him

224
00:12:47.885 --> 00:12:50.865
and sin enters to the world and they die.

225
00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:55.225
Not immediately physically, but they died spiritually.

226
00:12:56.135 --> 00:13:00.545
They will die later physically. Death is a penalty for sin.

227
00:13:01.845 --> 00:13:04.775
It's part of the curse of the fall.

228
00:13:05.675 --> 00:13:10.295
You're familiar with Romans 6 23, the wages of sin is death.

229
00:13:10.515 --> 00:13:14.135
You know that Romans five in verse 12, just

230
00:13:14.235 --> 00:13:18.695
as sin entered the world through one man, that's Adam death

231
00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:19.895
through sin.

232
00:13:20.045 --> 00:13:23.255
Paul says, remember that death is the penalty for sin.

233
00:13:23.955 --> 00:13:26.335
And so death spread to all men

234
00:13:26.335 --> 00:13:27.935
because all sinned,

235
00:13:28.995 --> 00:13:32.295
we are born spiritually dead.

236
00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:36.155
The Bible says we're conceived in sin.

237
00:13:36.175 --> 00:13:37.595
We are spiritually dead.

238
00:13:37.675 --> 00:13:41.035
I know you're alive physically someday you're going

239
00:13:41.035 --> 00:13:42.475
to die physically.

240
00:13:43.015 --> 00:13:47.075
But right now we are born spiritually

241
00:13:47.745 --> 00:13:49.515
dead before salvation.

242
00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:51.955
So why do we need to be saved?

243
00:13:52.135 --> 00:13:54.315
We are dead in our trespasses and sins.

244
00:13:54.495 --> 00:13:56.475
And then Paul says, we follow the prince

245
00:13:56.935 --> 00:13:58.555
of the power of the heir.

246
00:13:59.065 --> 00:14:00.235
What in the world does that mean?

247
00:14:00.235 --> 00:14:02.675
That's just a description of Satan whom

248
00:14:03.305 --> 00:14:07.215
Jesus called the prince of demons, the ruler of this world.

249
00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:10.015
And you and I know we live in a physical world,

250
00:14:10.295 --> 00:14:11.855
tangible world that we can see and touch,

251
00:14:11.915 --> 00:14:13.975
but there's another world,

252
00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:17.575
a spiritual world we can't see and we can't touch.

253
00:14:18.435 --> 00:14:21.855
And Satan is a very much a real part of that world

254
00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:26.415
and he's the ruler of that spiritual darkness.

255
00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:29.135
That's why Paul says Ephesians chapter six,

256
00:14:29.195 --> 00:14:32.655
we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, what we can see

257
00:14:32.755 --> 00:14:35.215
and touch, but against the rulers,

258
00:14:35.215 --> 00:14:38.255
against the cosmic powers over this present darkness,

259
00:14:39.195 --> 00:14:42.055
the other world against the spiritual forces

260
00:14:42.155 --> 00:14:44.255
of evil in heavenly places.

261
00:14:44.545 --> 00:14:48.175
Satan is the prince of that darkness,

262
00:14:48.205 --> 00:14:50.455
that spiritual darkness Paul is talking about.

263
00:14:51.105 --> 00:14:54.605
You and I are born dead in our trespasses and sins

264
00:14:54.665 --> 00:14:58.365
and we're also born into spiritual darkness.

265
00:14:59.705 --> 00:15:03.815
And that means Satan has a great deal of influence

266
00:15:03.915 --> 00:15:05.335
and control in our lives.

267
00:15:05.435 --> 00:15:07.815
Before salvation, we are dead

268
00:15:08.795 --> 00:15:12.735
and we are in darkness is the way Paul is describing this.

269
00:15:12.735 --> 00:15:15.815
Listen to Colossians chapter one, verse 13.

270
00:15:16.205 --> 00:15:19.495
When we are saved, when we give our lives to Christ,

271
00:15:19.555 --> 00:15:22.775
he has delivered us from the domain of darkness

272
00:15:23.595 --> 00:15:25.055
and transferred us to the kingdom

273
00:15:25.075 --> 00:15:26.895
of his beloved son into light

274
00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.615
before salvation, we are dead

275
00:15:31.075 --> 00:15:34.495
and we are in darkness, trapped in

276
00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:38.295
Satan's control, the prince of the power of the air.

277
00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:41.695
That's how we are. That's how we come into this world.

278
00:15:43.395 --> 00:15:45.975
And then Paul says, we follow the course of this world.

279
00:15:46.765 --> 00:15:50.795
What does that mean? Because we are born dead

280
00:15:50.935 --> 00:15:53.235
and we are born in that spiritual darkness

281
00:15:53.295 --> 00:15:56.675
and Satan has a lot of control and influence in our lives.

282
00:15:57.995 --> 00:16:01.575
Uh, he's working to conform us into his image.

283
00:16:02.085 --> 00:16:06.695
He's working to mold us into his image, the views

284
00:16:06.755 --> 00:16:09.175
and values of this fallen world.

285
00:16:11.215 --> 00:16:13.275
That's why Paul says in Romans 12,

286
00:16:13.495 --> 00:16:16.115
do not be conformed to this world.

287
00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:20.235
Satan is trying to mold you, shape you into his image.

288
00:16:20.865 --> 00:16:24.035
This world is fallen, broken, sinful.

289
00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:28.235
But that's what Satan is trying to mold you into.

290
00:16:28.235 --> 00:16:31.995
Listen to one John two 15 and 16. Do not love the world.

291
00:16:33.515 --> 00:16:36.175
Do not love the things in the world. Why not?

292
00:16:36.175 --> 00:16:40.265
Because they are not of God. They are of the world.

293
00:16:40.515 --> 00:16:45.005
Satan is influencing you, controlling you

294
00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:46.805
to mold you into his image,

295
00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:49.405
and he wants you to follow the course of this world.

296
00:16:49.945 --> 00:16:54.765
Our condition before salvation is hopeless, spiritually,

297
00:16:55.035 --> 00:16:59.325
dead, dark, under the control, the influence of Satan,

298
00:16:59.325 --> 00:17:03.645
and he's molding us the way he wants us before salvation.

299
00:17:03.865 --> 00:17:05.125
We are hopeless.

300
00:17:06.105 --> 00:17:09.405
And then Paul calls us in verse two, sons of disobedience.

301
00:17:10.585 --> 00:17:13.965
Why does he call us sons of disobedience in our sin?

302
00:17:14.025 --> 00:17:18.715
We don't love God. We love ourselves in our sin.

303
00:17:18.715 --> 00:17:21.755
We don't obey God. We do what we want to do.

304
00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:23.915
We disobey God.

305
00:17:24.235 --> 00:17:25.915
Remember, we're under Satan's control

306
00:17:26.415 --> 00:17:30.955
and he wants us to rebel against God just like he did

307
00:17:32.175 --> 00:17:34.475
and disobey his commands.

308
00:17:35.255 --> 00:17:39.075
That's why Paul says in Romans three, none is righteous.

309
00:17:40.095 --> 00:17:43.635
No not one. No one understands.

310
00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:45.355
No one seeks for God

311
00:17:46.575 --> 00:17:51.565
because we are rotten, fallen, just like our first parents.

312
00:17:51.975 --> 00:17:53.885
We've inherited that sinful nature.

313
00:17:54.215 --> 00:17:57.925
Later Paul says in Romans 3 23, all have sinned

314
00:17:57.925 --> 00:18:00.485
and fall short of the glory of God.

315
00:18:00.795 --> 00:18:03.445
Just like Adam and Eve, they disobeyed God.

316
00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:06.885
They handed down that sinful nature to their descendants.

317
00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:11.485
That's us. We are disobedient to God at first.

318
00:18:12.715 --> 00:18:15.415
We don't have a choice. That's our nature.

319
00:18:15.635 --> 00:18:17.575
We are sons of disobedience.

320
00:18:18.685 --> 00:18:21.905
And then verse three, Paul says, we are children of wrath

321
00:18:22.335 --> 00:18:24.065
because we are born dead.

322
00:18:24.795 --> 00:18:27.945
We're born into that darkness. We're under Satan's control.

323
00:18:28.045 --> 00:18:31.825
We rebel against God just like he did.

324
00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:34.865
We disobey his commands.

325
00:18:35.445 --> 00:18:37.505
We deserve God's wrath,

326
00:18:39.395 --> 00:18:41.175
his judgment, his punishment.

327
00:18:44.045 --> 00:18:45.105
Why do we need to be saved?

328
00:18:45.105 --> 00:18:48.985
Because our condition before salvation is hopeless.

329
00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:54.605
Now there's more to the story.

330
00:18:54.605 --> 00:18:58.235
Aren't you glad there's good news this morning?

331
00:18:58.925 --> 00:19:01.955
Let's answer question number four. Who does the saving?

332
00:19:03.415 --> 00:19:07.155
Who does the saving? If we are dead in our trespasses

333
00:19:07.415 --> 00:19:11.795
and sins, dead men can't resuscitate themselves.

334
00:19:13.155 --> 00:19:14.335
Who does the saving?

335
00:19:14.565 --> 00:19:18.935
Well, perhaps the sweetest words in this passage, you need

336
00:19:18.935 --> 00:19:22.115
to underline, highlight, circle, star,

337
00:19:22.505 --> 00:19:23.955
beginning of verse four.

338
00:19:24.175 --> 00:19:27.905
But God, but God,

339
00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:33.185
you were born dead in your trespasses and sin,

340
00:19:33.285 --> 00:19:34.905
but God made you alive.

341
00:19:37.255 --> 00:19:39.315
You were born into spiritual darkness,

342
00:19:39.375 --> 00:19:42.955
but God transferred you into the kingdom

343
00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:44.955
of His Son into light.

344
00:19:45.775 --> 00:19:50.125
You were, you were, you were,

345
00:19:50.345 --> 00:19:51.965
but God, but God.

346
00:19:53.355 --> 00:19:57.135
So then who does the saving? It's God alone.

347
00:19:57.915 --> 00:20:01.055
Who does the saving? Salvation is entirely

348
00:20:01.815 --> 00:20:03.135
a work of God.

349
00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:04.935
We cannot save ourselves.

350
00:20:07.845 --> 00:20:09.265
God has to do the saving.

351
00:20:12.025 --> 00:20:13.905
Salvation is entirely a work of God.

352
00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:17.975
But why would he do that? Why would he do that?

353
00:20:21.425 --> 00:20:23.315
Paul goes on verses four and five,

354
00:20:23.535 --> 00:20:27.675
but God listen to some key words, being rich in mercy.

355
00:20:29.015 --> 00:20:32.755
God is merciful because of his great love.

356
00:20:33.095 --> 00:20:36.775
God is loving with which he loved us

357
00:20:37.805 --> 00:20:40.215
even when we were dead in our trespasses.

358
00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:44.255
He made us alive together with Christ by grace.

359
00:20:45.405 --> 00:20:47.135
Something we do not deserve.

360
00:20:47.665 --> 00:20:51.885
By grace, have you been saved? He is merciful.

361
00:20:52.345 --> 00:20:55.005
He is loving. He is gracious.

362
00:20:56.695 --> 00:21:00.645
That's why he decided to save us.

363
00:21:00.645 --> 00:21:03.265
Listen to Titus three.

364
00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:05.825
He saved us not

365
00:21:05.825 --> 00:21:08.745
because of works done by us in righteousness,

366
00:21:09.165 --> 00:21:12.145
but according to His mer mercy.

367
00:21:12.445 --> 00:21:14.225
God is merciful.

368
00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:17.585
Romans chapter five, God shows his love for us

369
00:21:17.605 --> 00:21:22.145
and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

370
00:21:22.565 --> 00:21:24.385
God is loving.

371
00:21:26.075 --> 00:21:30.935
Second to Timothy one, nine, God who saved us

372
00:21:31.035 --> 00:21:32.735
and called us to a holy calling.

373
00:21:33.475 --> 00:21:35.015
Not because of our works, but

374
00:21:35.015 --> 00:21:37.855
because of his own purpose and grace.

375
00:21:38.635 --> 00:21:42.455
God is gracious mercy, love and grace.

376
00:21:43.075 --> 00:21:45.855
We didn't deserve it. We couldn't earn it.

377
00:21:46.195 --> 00:21:47.535
He had to do it for us.

378
00:21:48.335 --> 00:21:52.435
Salvation is entirely a work of God,

379
00:21:53.475 --> 00:21:54.495
not of our own doing.

380
00:21:55.245 --> 00:21:57.455
Skip on down there in Ephesians two to verse 10.

381
00:21:58.055 --> 00:22:01.535
I love this. Paul says, we are his workmanship.

382
00:22:02.485 --> 00:22:07.175
Shorten that to we are his work. It's his work.

383
00:22:07.445 --> 00:22:10.295
He's the one that saves us, not ourselves.

384
00:22:11.595 --> 00:22:16.115
We were dead once, but God gave us life.

385
00:22:17.275 --> 00:22:21.255
We were rotten, but God made us right.

386
00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:25.695
We were slaves once, but God set us free.

387
00:22:26.315 --> 00:22:29.655
If no, but God, where would we be?

388
00:22:32.165 --> 00:22:35.615
Only by the grace of God are we saved.

389
00:22:37.235 --> 00:22:40.985
Who does the saving? Salvation

390
00:22:41.045 --> 00:22:42.385
is entirely a work of God.

391
00:22:44.415 --> 00:22:47.515
How does he do it? How are we saved?

392
00:22:47.685 --> 00:22:50.895
Let's answer that question. How are we saved?

393
00:22:53.735 --> 00:22:55.995
You know, the world would say we're saved by our works.

394
00:22:56.015 --> 00:22:59.435
Things that we can do. We can earn the righteousness of God.

395
00:23:00.215 --> 00:23:02.075
You know, before sin entered into the world,

396
00:23:02.075 --> 00:23:03.275
that might have been true.

397
00:23:04.865 --> 00:23:08.435
Adam and Eve were told, if you obey me, you live.

398
00:23:08.935 --> 00:23:10.595
If you disobey, you die.

399
00:23:11.605 --> 00:23:15.475
Their lives were dependent on their obedience, their works.

400
00:23:16.835 --> 00:23:19.615
But you and I know what happened. They disobeyed.

401
00:23:19.615 --> 00:23:22.895
They rebelled against God and sin entered into the world.

402
00:23:23.675 --> 00:23:26.135
And you and I inherited that sinful nature.

403
00:23:26.395 --> 00:23:29.295
So now after sin works don't work,

404
00:23:32.785 --> 00:23:35.205
we fall short of God's standard of righteousness.

405
00:23:35.305 --> 00:23:37.925
We are incapable of earning salvation.

406
00:23:38.145 --> 00:23:41.365
So God had to make a way for us to be saved.

407
00:23:41.705 --> 00:23:46.155
How did he do it? He sent his only son,

408
00:23:46.805 --> 00:23:50.535
Jesus Christ, who came

409
00:23:51.655 --> 00:23:53.855
conceived by the spirit born of a virgin

410
00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:58.895
and who lived a sinless life, meaning

411
00:23:58.965 --> 00:24:02.975
that he obeyed God perfectly, which Adam did not do.

412
00:24:05.175 --> 00:24:07.325
Christ obeyed.

413
00:24:07.585 --> 00:24:10.285
God perfectly, lived a sinless life.

414
00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:14.525
And that penalty for sin is still there.

415
00:24:14.535 --> 00:24:16.325
Death is still the penalty for sin.

416
00:24:16.345 --> 00:24:20.885
But God said this because my son has lived a sinless life.

417
00:24:21.845 --> 00:24:25.005
I will accept his death on your behalf.

418
00:24:27.995 --> 00:24:29.915
I will accept his sacrifice

419
00:24:30.655 --> 00:24:33.835
and spare you the penalty for your sin.

420
00:24:34.335 --> 00:24:35.515
So he died on a cross

421
00:24:37.905 --> 00:24:40.135
for you and for me.

422
00:24:42.495 --> 00:24:43.785
That sinless life.

423
00:24:44.245 --> 00:24:47.425
God took and he gave it to you

424
00:24:48.565 --> 00:24:51.065
and he took your sin and he put it on Christ.

425
00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:56.015
And Christ sacrificed himself on that cross for you

426
00:24:56.395 --> 00:24:57.455
to have salvation,

427
00:25:02.035 --> 00:25:03.775
you and I cannot save ourselves.

428
00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:06.015
Only God can do the work.

429
00:25:06.035 --> 00:25:10.815
And he did the work through his son, Jesus Christ. But how?

430
00:25:11.715 --> 00:25:12.815
How are we saved?

431
00:25:14.495 --> 00:25:17.065
Paul answers this question in verses eight and nine.

432
00:25:17.155 --> 00:25:20.265
We're saved by grace. We don't deserve it.

433
00:25:21.935 --> 00:25:26.595
Through faith. Through faith. What is faith?

434
00:25:28.715 --> 00:25:31.385
Faith is a trust in

435
00:25:31.675 --> 00:25:33.795
what Christ has done on our behalf.

436
00:25:35.875 --> 00:25:38.415
We believe that his work on the cross

437
00:25:38.965 --> 00:25:40.935
will save us from the penalty of sin.

438
00:25:40.935 --> 00:25:45.255
If we put our faith in Jesus, God will accept his death

439
00:25:46.235 --> 00:25:49.335
on our behalf and he will give us eternal life

440
00:25:49.515 --> 00:25:52.695
and righteousness right standing with him.

441
00:25:52.805 --> 00:25:56.705
Instead, he exchanges Christ's righteousness

442
00:25:57.125 --> 00:26:01.025
for our sinfulness through faith.

443
00:26:01.245 --> 00:26:04.945
We have to trust that, believing that that is true.

444
00:26:08.415 --> 00:26:11.505
I've had a suitcase up here this whole time.

445
00:26:11.505 --> 00:26:12.945
You've been wondering why it's here.

446
00:26:15.215 --> 00:26:18.795
If you were planning on going on a trip for about a year

447
00:26:19.735 --> 00:26:22.355
and you had a lot of things that you need to get in order

448
00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:25.715
to do that, a lot of packing to do, and a friend came to you

449
00:26:25.775 --> 00:26:28.515
and said, you don't have to do a thing,

450
00:26:28.705 --> 00:26:30.355
I've packed your bag for you.

451
00:26:32.775 --> 00:26:35.515
Really? Yes, I've packed your bag for you.

452
00:26:35.515 --> 00:26:37.995
Everything you need for a year is in that suitcase.

453
00:26:40.035 --> 00:26:42.745
Would you believe your friend

454
00:26:44.075 --> 00:26:45.735
and would you trust your friend

455
00:26:45.735 --> 00:26:48.455
that he's got everything in the bag that you need?

456
00:26:50.045 --> 00:26:52.735
Yeah, I don't think so. No, no, no, no. It's in the bag.

457
00:26:54.685 --> 00:26:59.535
Did you remember to get it's in the bag? Really?

458
00:27:01.945 --> 00:27:06.065
Okay, I believe you. I trust you.

459
00:27:06.165 --> 00:27:07.985
I'm gonna put my faith in you

460
00:27:09.825 --> 00:27:14.185
and accept that the suitcase has everything I need.

461
00:27:16.385 --> 00:27:20.215
God, the Father has made a way for you

462
00:27:20.215 --> 00:27:22.985
and I to be right with him again.

463
00:27:23.205 --> 00:27:27.995
To be saved from the penalty of sin, to escape

464
00:27:28.935 --> 00:27:30.355
the curse of death

465
00:27:30.455 --> 00:27:34.395
and have eternal life through Jesus Christ.

466
00:27:35.835 --> 00:27:38.495
God has offered you a free gift.

467
00:27:39.275 --> 00:27:43.425
You have done nothing to deserve it, nothing to earn it.

468
00:27:44.535 --> 00:27:47.385
It's just His grace, his goodness,

469
00:27:48.735 --> 00:27:51.765
everything you need to be right with God

470
00:27:52.775 --> 00:27:55.555
to live eternally with him in heaven.

471
00:27:56.785 --> 00:27:59.895
Everything you need to have new life, new hope,

472
00:28:01.525 --> 00:28:04.125
a second chance, it's in the bag.

473
00:28:04.755 --> 00:28:08.355
What do you do?

474
00:28:10.205 --> 00:28:13.385
Put your hope and faith and trust in the God.

475
00:28:13.405 --> 00:28:14.865
Do you trust God at His word?

476
00:28:15.205 --> 00:28:18.705
Do you believe that the gift has everything you

477
00:28:18.775 --> 00:28:21.315
need to be right with him?

478
00:28:21.365 --> 00:28:21.715
Again,

479
00:28:26.725 --> 00:28:27.665
what's in the bag?

480
00:28:27.855 --> 00:28:30.065
What are the benefits of salvation?

481
00:28:31.355 --> 00:28:32.745
Let's answer that last question.

482
00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:36.225
What are the benefits of salvation?

483
00:28:36.845 --> 00:28:41.815
To be honest with you, they are endless. They are endless.

484
00:28:42.195 --> 00:28:44.215
The benefits of being saved are endless.

485
00:28:44.455 --> 00:28:48.825
I could spend a year of sermons on this.

486
00:28:50.205 --> 00:28:51.595
We're gonna try to dive a little more

487
00:28:51.595 --> 00:28:52.635
deeply on Wednesday nights.

488
00:28:53.175 --> 00:28:54.835
Uh, we, this coming Wednesday night at six

489
00:28:54.835 --> 00:28:56.035
15, right in here.

490
00:28:56.855 --> 00:28:58.785
I'll try to answer that question a little more fully.

491
00:28:58.805 --> 00:29:03.015
But there are three benefits in this passage. Verse five.

492
00:29:03.925 --> 00:29:06.575
Paul says, even when we were dead in our trespasses,

493
00:29:06.595 --> 00:29:08.615
he made us alive together with Christ.

494
00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:12.895
One of the benefits of salvation is you're not dead anymore.

495
00:29:12.955 --> 00:29:16.695
You have new life in Christ.

496
00:29:18.375 --> 00:29:19.915
You're not spiritually dead.

497
00:29:19.915 --> 00:29:22.875
You're spiritually alive in him.

498
00:29:23.925 --> 00:29:26.825
He has resurrected your dead spirit

499
00:29:27.285 --> 00:29:29.105
and made it alive with Christ.

500
00:29:29.325 --> 00:29:31.465
You're no longer part of Satan's dominion.

501
00:29:31.465 --> 00:29:33.265
You're not in that darkness anymore.

502
00:29:33.765 --> 00:29:36.585
You've been transferred to the kingdom of his beloved son.

503
00:29:36.885 --> 00:29:40.105
You are now in the light with Christ.

504
00:29:40.685 --> 00:29:42.245
New life right here on Earth.

505
00:29:42.765 --> 00:29:46.995
A second chance, verse 10.

506
00:29:48.005 --> 00:29:50.695
Paul says, we have a new mission and a new purpose in life.

507
00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:52.175
We are his workmanship.

508
00:29:52.205 --> 00:29:56.695
Paul says, created in Christ Jesus for good works.

509
00:29:57.635 --> 00:30:00.715
We have a new mission and a new purpose in life.

510
00:30:01.975 --> 00:30:03.755
God has things for us to do

511
00:30:03.965 --> 00:30:05.035
after salvation,

512
00:30:05.185 --> 00:30:08.235
like telling other people the good news of salvation.

513
00:30:09.435 --> 00:30:11.575
We have a new mission, a new purpose to walk

514
00:30:12.275 --> 00:30:13.455
and live for Christ.

515
00:30:14.335 --> 00:30:18.035
And then verse six, Paul says, we have eternal life.

516
00:30:19.315 --> 00:30:20.935
He raised us up with him

517
00:30:21.035 --> 00:30:23.855
and seeded us with him in the heavenly

518
00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:25.215
places in Christ Jesus.

519
00:30:25.835 --> 00:30:30.775
We no longer have to fear the curse and the penalty of sin

520
00:30:31.045 --> 00:30:34.375
because we have life eternal.

521
00:30:34.475 --> 00:30:37.305
We don't have to fear death anymore.

522
00:30:37.945 --> 00:30:41.825
Physical death, spiritual death. It's in the bag.

523
00:30:42.455 --> 00:30:43.345
Eternal life.

524
00:30:47.235 --> 00:30:50.055
The doctrine of salvation is amazing,

525
00:30:52.035 --> 00:30:54.255
but it's more than just a doctrine.

526
00:30:54.255 --> 00:30:57.055
We're talking the difference between life and death.

527
00:30:57.835 --> 00:31:00.355
And you and I can only stand back

528
00:31:00.355 --> 00:31:03.075
and say, we have an amazing God.

529
00:31:03.255 --> 00:31:04.755
We don't understand it all.

530
00:31:05.795 --> 00:31:09.155
I didn't deserve any of this, but thank you, God.

531
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:12.435
You are gracious and good and merciful.

532
00:31:12.445 --> 00:31:14.435
Thank you God for the gift of salvation.

533
00:31:16.525 --> 00:31:17.865
And that's why I love verse seven.

534
00:31:18.765 --> 00:31:23.125
In the coming ages, he might show us

535
00:31:23.745 --> 00:31:25.685
the immeasurable riches of his grace

536
00:31:26.505 --> 00:31:29.245
in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

537
00:31:29.385 --> 00:31:32.805
You know why we get to live eternally with Jesus Christ

538
00:31:32.905 --> 00:31:36.565
and God because it's gonna take an eternity to praise him

539
00:31:36.585 --> 00:31:37.885
for everything that he is done for us.

540
00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:42.345
The benefits are endless,

541
00:31:43.325 --> 00:31:46.745
and it's gonna take all of eternity to thank him

542
00:31:46.845 --> 00:31:48.225
for everything he's done for us.

543
00:31:49.565 --> 00:31:53.965
That's amazing. We were dead once,

544
00:31:54.105 --> 00:31:55.565
but God gave us life.

545
00:31:57.505 --> 00:31:59.405
We were rotten. But God made us right.

546
00:31:59.425 --> 00:32:02.085
We were slaves once, but God set us free.

547
00:32:02.545 --> 00:32:06.405
If no, but God, where would we be?

548
00:32:09.235 --> 00:32:11.575
The doctrine of salvation, beautiful,

549
00:32:13.415 --> 00:32:15.585
powerful, transformative.

550
00:32:17.825 --> 00:32:20.275
Some of you I know in this room have

551
00:32:22.775 --> 00:32:24.795
put your faith in Christ

552
00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:27.325
and you've been walking

553
00:32:27.635 --> 00:32:31.415
with him faithfully your whole life.

554
00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:38.555
He is your life. You live for him. You share others.

555
00:32:39.705 --> 00:32:41.655
Share with others what he's done for you.

556
00:32:44.805 --> 00:32:48.215
Some of you, uh, a better description might be, you know

557
00:32:48.215 --> 00:32:49.575
what God has done for you

558
00:32:53.555 --> 00:32:57.215
and you are hanging on to Christ with everything you've got.

559
00:32:58.705 --> 00:33:01.125
Not because you've earned your salvation

560
00:33:01.125 --> 00:33:03.175
or you're gonna lose it, but

561
00:33:03.175 --> 00:33:06.935
because you know what God has done for you in salvation.

562
00:33:10.565 --> 00:33:14.425
Some of you are not so sure

563
00:33:17.855 --> 00:33:18.915
you've heard me today,

564
00:33:20.065 --> 00:33:22.325
but you're like, yeah, I don't know about that.

565
00:33:24.875 --> 00:33:29.755
I'll save myself. I'll trust in myself.

566
00:33:30.615 --> 00:33:34.085
Well, I've got bad news for you. That's a dead end.

567
00:33:36.425 --> 00:33:40.825
You are spiritually dead. You're in the kingdom of darkness.

568
00:33:40.825 --> 00:33:44.145
You're under the control, the influence of the enemy,

569
00:33:45.045 --> 00:33:47.865
and you are rotten to the core.

570
00:33:48.975 --> 00:33:51.315
In one of these days. You're gonna have to stand in front

571
00:33:51.315 --> 00:33:54.725
of the Lord and be held accountable for

572
00:33:54.725 --> 00:33:59.045
what you have done at that point.

573
00:33:59.155 --> 00:34:03.405
It's too late. You'll be judged, you'll be sentenced.

574
00:34:03.405 --> 00:34:08.285
You'll be condemned to an eternal punishment

575
00:34:08.285 --> 00:34:09.645
in a place called hell.

576
00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:16.685
Do not miss your opportunity today

577
00:34:19.135 --> 00:34:23.875
to accept the free gift of God in salvation.
