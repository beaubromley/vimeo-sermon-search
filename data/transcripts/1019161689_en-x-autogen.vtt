1
00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:16.245
Well, good morning church.

2
00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:17.325
It's great to see you.

3
00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:19.725
Uh, if you are new to our church, we're

4
00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.125
so thankful you would take that step of faith to be here.

5
00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:24.805
Uh, we know it's not easy to walk into a new place,

6
00:00:24.865 --> 00:00:26.125
and so we're grateful for that.

7
00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:28.605
Uh, please head to the new here area after this.

8
00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:30.005
We'd love to meet you and get to know you

9
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.845
and help connect you to our church if we can.

10
00:00:33.025 --> 00:00:34.565
Uh, so please let us have that opportunity.

11
00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:37.045
Also, due to fall break this week,

12
00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:40.885
we are not having Wednesday night gatherings here on campus,

13
00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:44.845
but also in look in the app towards next Wednesday,

14
00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:47.125
we're kicking off a new slate of equipping classes.

15
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:48.525
So make sure you look at those.

16
00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:51.925
There's some exciting things in that as we kind of reset

17
00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:55.085
after fall break into a new time for Wednesday nights.

18
00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:59.805
And finally, excuse me, for members today is a, a big deal.

19
00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:03.725
We are finalizing today the, the vote

20
00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:05.965
for those elder candidates that we've been putting

21
00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.365
before you for the last couple weeks.

22
00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:10.325
So if you haven't already, you can, uh,

23
00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:14.525
take your email you got on Thursday and you can vote there

24
00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:16.645
or you can head out to the information desk

25
00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:20.445
and make sure that you vote on, uh, those as we go to today.

26
00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:23.245
So by the time we're done with the second service

27
00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:25.365
around noon, uh, we'll close that.

28
00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:27.365
And so if you get a chance to, as soon as we're done

29
00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:29.565
with this head out there or pull open your email

30
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.805
and do that as we turn to God's word.

31
00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:35.365
Now, let me invite you to take your copy of God's word

32
00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:38.245
and open it to one Samuel chapter 12.

33
00:01:39.535 --> 00:01:42.485
Maybe scroll down to one Samuel 12, however you use that.

34
00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:45.485
It's early in the Bible. One Samuel

35
00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:47.565
big number 12 is the chapter.

36
00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:53.325
As we walk through this book, what we're gonna see today is

37
00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:57.045
really kind of Samuel's farewell address.

38
00:01:57.155 --> 00:01:58.645
It's not essentially that,

39
00:01:58.665 --> 00:02:01.045
but we'll see that this, this prophet judge

40
00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:05.165
that God had used to transition Israel from what it was

41
00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:08.205
to a monarchy, uh, Samuel's kind

42
00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:09.485
of fading to the background.

43
00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:11.405
He's still gonna be involved as we go forward.

44
00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:13.445
We'll see that, but he won't be as public.

45
00:02:13.545 --> 00:02:16.885
And so this is kind of his last words you might say.

46
00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:20.125
And the context of his speech is

47
00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.925
that coronation ceremony we saw at the end

48
00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:25.925
of chapter 11 last week where they gathered at Gilgal

49
00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.845
and they renewed the kingdom is the way they put it.

50
00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:32.285
And they worshiped the Lord. They sacrificed to the Lord.

51
00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:34.525
They crowned Saul officially is the king.

52
00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:38.565
This is the context, is what Samuel then turns

53
00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:42.525
that into is in a sense like a covenant renewal ceremony,

54
00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:48.015
where they were reminded who they were

55
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:53.375
as God's people, including

56
00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:56.615
reminded about how far they've drifted away from

57
00:02:56.615 --> 00:03:01.305
that reality, that they drifted so far,

58
00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:03.225
that they even asked for a king instead

59
00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:04.785
of trusting God as their king.

60
00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:09.355
And so this moment of covenant renewal is kind

61
00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.075
of the question like, okay, is this thing even gonna work?

62
00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:14.535
We've seen the problems already. Is this thing gonna work?

63
00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:17.375
Is monarchy even where God wants this to go?

64
00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:22.795
Well look at Samuel's words starting in verse

65
00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:24.515
one, chapter 12.

66
00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:31.185
And Samuel said to all Israel, behold,

67
00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:32.985
I have obeyed your voice and all that you've said

68
00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:34.425
to me made a king over you.

69
00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:37.985
And now behold, the king walks before you, meaning he's here

70
00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:41.705
and I am old and gray and behold my sons are with you.

71
00:03:41.775 --> 00:03:44.825
I've walked before you from my youth until this day.

72
00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:47.825
Here I am testify against me

73
00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:49.385
before the Lord, before is anointed.

74
00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:51.945
Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken?

75
00:03:52.295 --> 00:03:53.585
Whom have I defrauded?

76
00:03:54.015 --> 00:03:57.185
Whom have I oppressed or from whose hand have I taken a

77
00:03:57.185 --> 00:04:00.945
bribe to blind my eyes with it, testify against me,

78
00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:02.145
I'll restore it to you.

79
00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:06.075
And they said, you have not defrauded us or oppressed us

80
00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:08.115
or taken anything from any man's hand.

81
00:04:09.175 --> 00:04:11.195
And he said to them, the Lord is witness against you

82
00:04:11.215 --> 00:04:14.075
and is anointed as a witness against you this day

83
00:04:14.075 --> 00:04:15.955
that you have not found anything in my hand.

84
00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:19.115
And they said, he is witness.

85
00:04:20.715 --> 00:04:22.055
Now, we'll stop there for a moment

86
00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:24.095
because what's happening here at the beginning

87
00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:25.975
of this covenant renewal ceremony,

88
00:04:27.395 --> 00:04:28.735
we learned something from this.

89
00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:32.805
The first thing, what Samuel's doing here is it's showing us

90
00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:34.365
his Godly leadership.

91
00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:38.185
We learn about this right off the bat.

92
00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:41.425
We learn about Samuel's godly leadership in the nation.

93
00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:45.205
Now, some people might feel like he's boasting.

94
00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:47.245
He he's not boasting here.

95
00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:50.045
He's just merely asking them to confirm

96
00:04:50.275 --> 00:04:51.685
that he was above reproach.

97
00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:54.125
What was was I who I said I was?

98
00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:57.365
You've watched me from when I was a child in the tabernacle.

99
00:04:57.945 --> 00:05:01.775
Am I who I say I am? Have you watched me?

100
00:05:01.775 --> 00:05:03.135
Have you seen me?

101
00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:06.885
And they had to say yes because he had been doing that.

102
00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:10.285
You might say he's in this doing something more than just

103
00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:12.085
kind of getting this affirmation.

104
00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:13.685
He's setting an example

105
00:05:15.245 --> 00:05:16.985
for every leader who would follow him.

106
00:05:17.915 --> 00:05:20.625
Every priest, every prophet, every king, even

107
00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:22.705
that he's not gonna be perfect,

108
00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:27.235
but he has to set an example of Godly leadership

109
00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:28.915
and lead in that kind of way.

110
00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:32.005
So that's the first thing we learned. But that wasn't all.

111
00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:34.445
Look now as we continue verses six through 11,

112
00:05:35.345 --> 00:05:37.085
Samuel gives him a little history lesson.

113
00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:41.675
Samuel said to the people, the Lord is witness

114
00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:43.595
who appointed Moses and Aaron

115
00:05:43.615 --> 00:05:45.755
and brought your fathers up outta the land of Egypt.

116
00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:49.335
Now therefore, stand still that I may plead with you

117
00:05:49.335 --> 00:05:51.975
before the Lord concerning all the righteous deeds

118
00:05:51.975 --> 00:05:54.615
of the Lord that he performed for you and your fathers.

119
00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:57.250
When Jacob went into Egypt

120
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.810
and the Egyptians oppressed them,

121
00:05:58.915 --> 00:06:00.765
then your fathers cried out to the Lord.

122
00:06:01.025 --> 00:06:04.285
The Lord sent Moses and Aaron who brought your fathers out

123
00:06:04.285 --> 00:06:06.405
of Egypt, made them dwell in this place,

124
00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:09.375
but they forgot the Lord their God.

125
00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:12.055
And he sold them into the hand of Cicero, commander

126
00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:14.575
of the army of Hazo into the hand of the Philistines,

127
00:06:14.845 --> 00:06:16.575
into the hand of the king of Moab.

128
00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:20.415
They fought against them and they cried out to the Lord

129
00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:24.295
and said, we have sinned because we have forsaken the Lord

130
00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:26.855
and have served the Baals and the Aral,

131
00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:30.155
but now deliver us outta the hand of our enemies

132
00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:31.155
that we may serve you.

133
00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:36.475
And the Lord sent j Baal and Barak and Jeff Thaw

134
00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:38.355
and Samuel, those were all judges

135
00:06:38.975 --> 00:06:40.635
and delivered you out of the hand

136
00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:44.195
of your enemies on every side, and you lived in safety.

137
00:06:46.085 --> 00:06:48.465
So here Samuel, what he does is he walks

138
00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:49.665
through the history of Israel.

139
00:06:49.665 --> 00:06:52.105
What he does here is he showed God's gracious

140
00:06:52.215 --> 00:06:53.305
provision for the people.

141
00:06:55.155 --> 00:06:58.495
He was reminding them of God's gracious provision

142
00:06:59.125 --> 00:07:01.935
over the many generations before them.

143
00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:07.685
He recounted to the Israelites, God's faithfulness,

144
00:07:08.185 --> 00:07:09.725
the righteous deeds of the Lord.

145
00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:13.405
It says to them, to their ancestors, how God had

146
00:07:13.605 --> 00:07:15.085
provided for them over and over

147
00:07:15.345 --> 00:07:18.765
and over, how God had delivered his people from slavery in

148
00:07:18.765 --> 00:07:21.005
Egypt, how God had used the judges

149
00:07:21.225 --> 00:07:23.165
to deliver them from his enemies

150
00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:24.725
around them in the promised land.

151
00:07:26.995 --> 00:07:29.735
And not only did God deliver them from these people,

152
00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:32.175
God also provided this land for them

153
00:07:32.175 --> 00:07:33.215
that they're now living in.

154
00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:38.525
Like you just see his gracious provision.

155
00:07:40.705 --> 00:07:43.225
Yet in the same section

156
00:07:45.495 --> 00:07:46.995
you see God's gracious provision,

157
00:07:46.995 --> 00:07:50.075
but you also see Israel's shaky faith in the middle

158
00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:51.685
of it, right?

159
00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:55.245
You saw it right? You saw God's gracious provision.

160
00:07:55.385 --> 00:07:58.245
You saw how shaky their faith was in response.

161
00:08:00.895 --> 00:08:03.955
Now, that's a theme throughout the Old Testament

162
00:08:06.415 --> 00:08:09.325
where even though the Israelites had seen God do amazing

163
00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:13.005
things in Egypt, they so quickly forgot God.

164
00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:15.925
Like just think about what they saw.

165
00:08:15.955 --> 00:08:18.525
They saw plagues fall on their enemies.

166
00:08:18.525 --> 00:08:23.035
Instead of them, they saw their

167
00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:24.755
sons spared.

168
00:08:25.015 --> 00:08:26.635
If all they did was put some blood

169
00:08:26.695 --> 00:08:28.155
of the lamb on their doorpost,

170
00:08:30.025 --> 00:08:32.955
they saw the Red Sea split wide open.

171
00:08:35.445 --> 00:08:38.065
Yet over and over, those same people

172
00:08:39.805 --> 00:08:43.745
were afraid of what lay ahead like that.

173
00:08:43.745 --> 00:08:46.275
They'd seen it. And

174
00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:48.315
yet they walked in terror of what could happen.

175
00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:54.675
It says the way that the way it says it, God delivered them

176
00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:58.485
yet verse nine, they forgot the Lord their God

177
00:08:58.985 --> 00:09:00.045
and turned to idols.

178
00:09:01.295 --> 00:09:05.155
They just forgot all that God had done.

179
00:09:05.185 --> 00:09:06.955
Even after he disciplined them,

180
00:09:08.285 --> 00:09:10.505
he turned their hearts back to him.

181
00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:13.185
They lived in relative safety for a while in the land.

182
00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:17.005
What happened? Verse 12.

183
00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:23.045
And when you saw that ash, remember snake, the king

184
00:09:23.045 --> 00:09:24.885
of the Ammonites came against you.

185
00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:27.285
You said to me, no,

186
00:09:27.385 --> 00:09:29.085
but a king shall reign over us

187
00:09:30.025 --> 00:09:32.595
when the Lord your God was your king.

188
00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:40.335
Same song. Second verse, they'd forgotten

189
00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:44.455
all that God had done for them to get them to the place

190
00:09:44.705 --> 00:09:46.015
where they were to deliver them.

191
00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:48.655
They forgot that he had spared them.

192
00:09:48.805 --> 00:09:50.295
They forgot all that he'd done,

193
00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:52.175
and they were immediately afraid again.

194
00:09:52.235 --> 00:09:55.505
So that give us a king, we need somebody to protect us

195
00:09:57.655 --> 00:10:00.065
when God had done it over and over and over.

196
00:10:00.645 --> 00:10:04.425
So Israel's faith in Yahweh wavered a lot

197
00:10:04.535 --> 00:10:09.465
through this process, which is why God

198
00:10:09.465 --> 00:10:11.465
brought his holy justice.

199
00:10:13.005 --> 00:10:16.465
You see that here, God's holy justice.

200
00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:23.435
I'm gonna read a chunk of this now verses 13 through 25,

201
00:10:23.455 --> 00:10:24.875
and I want you to look for

202
00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:28.555
holy justice in these verses.

203
00:10:29.065 --> 00:10:31.795
Look for that concept of you reap what you sow.

204
00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:36.445
Look for the idea of God's holy justice,

205
00:10:36.515 --> 00:10:38.565
that he doesn't just sweep sin under the rug.

206
00:10:39.965 --> 00:10:41.635
Watch this. Verse 13.

207
00:10:43.355 --> 00:10:45.295
And now behold the king whom you have chosen

208
00:10:45.435 --> 00:10:47.095
for whom you've asked, behold the

209
00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:48.255
Lord has set a king over you.

210
00:10:49.195 --> 00:10:52.015
If you will fear the Lord and serve him and obey his voice

211
00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:54.455
and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord.

212
00:10:55.035 --> 00:10:56.975
And if both you and the king reigns over,

213
00:10:56.975 --> 00:10:58.495
you will follow the Lord your God.

214
00:10:58.835 --> 00:11:02.855
It will be well. But if you will not obey the voice

215
00:11:02.855 --> 00:11:06.055
of the Lord, but rebel against the commandment of the Lord,

216
00:11:06.285 --> 00:11:08.975
then the hand of the Lord will be against you and your king.

217
00:11:10.815 --> 00:11:12.035
Now therefore, stand still

218
00:11:12.035 --> 00:11:13.355
and see this great thing

219
00:11:13.355 --> 00:11:14.875
that the Lord will do before your eyes.

220
00:11:15.215 --> 00:11:19.555
Is it not wheat harvest Today, I will call upon the Lord

221
00:11:19.555 --> 00:11:23.295
that he may send thunder and rain and you shall know

222
00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:25.295
and see that your wickedness is great,

223
00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:26.455
which you have done in the sight

224
00:11:26.455 --> 00:11:28.695
of the Lord in asking for yourselves a king.

225
00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:31.155
So Samuel called upon the Lord.

226
00:11:31.295 --> 00:11:33.035
The Lord sent thunder and rain that day

227
00:11:33.215 --> 00:11:36.075
and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel

228
00:11:38.015 --> 00:11:41.195
and all the people said to Samuel, pray for your servants

229
00:11:41.195 --> 00:11:44.795
to the Lord your God that we may not die for we have added

230
00:11:44.895 --> 00:11:48.355
to all our sins, this evil to ask for ourselves a king.

231
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.875
And Samuel said to the people, do not be afraid.

232
00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:55.255
You have done all this evil

233
00:11:55.475 --> 00:11:58.055
yet do not turn aside from following the Lord,

234
00:11:58.275 --> 00:12:01.655
but serve the Lord with all your heart and do not turn aside

235
00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:03.415
after empty things that cannot profit

236
00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.175
or deliver for they're empty.

237
00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:08.225
For the Lord will not forsake his people

238
00:12:08.685 --> 00:12:10.105
for his great namesake

239
00:12:10.615 --> 00:12:12.305
because it is please the Lord

240
00:12:12.405 --> 00:12:14.705
to make you a people for himself.

241
00:12:16.245 --> 00:12:18.245
Moreover, as for me, far be it for me

242
00:12:18.245 --> 00:12:19.525
that I should sin against the Lord

243
00:12:19.525 --> 00:12:20.965
by ceasing to pray for you.

244
00:12:21.765 --> 00:12:24.005
I will instruct you in the good, in the right way,

245
00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:26.445
only fear the Lord

246
00:12:26.985 --> 00:12:30.485
and serve him faithfully with all your heart for consider

247
00:12:30.485 --> 00:12:32.365
what great things he has done for you.

248
00:12:33.605 --> 00:12:37.465
But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away,

249
00:12:38.055 --> 00:12:39.305
both you and your king.

250
00:12:41.485 --> 00:12:42.625
So you see it here, right?

251
00:12:44.355 --> 00:12:47.195
Samuel's recounting the obligations they had,

252
00:12:47.215 --> 00:12:49.755
the responsibilities they had under this covenant with God,

253
00:12:52.325 --> 00:12:55.625
and we see God's holy justice throughout it.

254
00:12:57.795 --> 00:12:59.805
It's pretty simple, right? If they obey the voice

255
00:12:59.985 --> 00:13:01.845
of the Lord, things will go well.

256
00:13:03.515 --> 00:13:07.255
If they don't, then the hand of the Lord will be against you

257
00:13:07.355 --> 00:13:10.365
and your king, right?

258
00:13:10.365 --> 00:13:13.645
If they turn, if they turn aside to things, empty things

259
00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:14.925
that will not profit

260
00:13:15.265 --> 00:13:18.205
or deliver, the Lord's hand of justice will come on them

261
00:13:18.385 --> 00:13:19.725
and will sweep them away.

262
00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:26.495
In fact, this storm that comes here in verses 16

263
00:13:26.495 --> 00:13:30.015
through 18 is illustration of that justice.

264
00:13:31.575 --> 00:13:32.715
Now, I love storms.

265
00:13:32.915 --> 00:13:36.315
I wanted to be a storm chaser when I grew up.

266
00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.755
Still kind of do in some ways.

267
00:13:38.215 --> 00:13:41.035
We would do this out in small town, western Oklahoma.

268
00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:43.155
We would chase storms on our own. We would do that.

269
00:13:43.285 --> 00:13:45.275
Thankfully, never got anything too serious.

270
00:13:45.535 --> 00:13:46.555
But we would do that.

271
00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.675
And I love the image, I love the power of God

272
00:13:49.675 --> 00:13:51.755
that you can see in thunderstorms.

273
00:13:53.855 --> 00:13:58.115
But this one here in one Samuel was not God merely showing

274
00:13:58.255 --> 00:14:00.915
off, which he kind of think maybe does sometimes.

275
00:14:01.185 --> 00:14:04.195
This storm was very specific.

276
00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:08.645
'cause notice in verse 17, it pinpoints

277
00:14:08.915 --> 00:14:10.245
that it was at the wheat harvest.

278
00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:12.955
Now why is that significant?

279
00:14:14.985 --> 00:14:16.415
First, because there weren't many

280
00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:18.175
storms at the time of the harvest.

281
00:14:19.045 --> 00:14:20.215
This would've been rare. And

282
00:14:20.215 --> 00:14:22.255
so there was clearly a miraculous moment.

283
00:14:22.285 --> 00:14:23.735
Even the fact that Samuel prayed

284
00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:25.935
and it happened was part of that, but also

285
00:14:25.935 --> 00:14:29.095
because if a storm would come at the time of harvest,

286
00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:33.535
there was a real threat of starvation for the people

287
00:14:35.255 --> 00:14:38.865
because the the wheat was ready to be plucked.

288
00:14:38.865 --> 00:14:40.225
And if the storm comes

289
00:14:40.325 --> 00:14:42.505
and destroys it, knocks it all to the ground.

290
00:14:42.535 --> 00:14:44.545
They can't get it to eat it.

291
00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:48.955
And so what Samuel's illustrating here

292
00:14:48.955 --> 00:14:52.165
with the storm is this threat of judgment.

293
00:14:52.545 --> 00:14:55.605
If they continued to in sin, this was going to happen.

294
00:14:56.255 --> 00:14:59.685
Starvation and famine was evidence

295
00:14:59.705 --> 00:15:02.085
of God's judgment on people at times.

296
00:15:04.415 --> 00:15:06.875
So it could ruin the grain, it could lead to justice.

297
00:15:07.095 --> 00:15:10.395
So he's saying if you continue in sin, you would be judged.

298
00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:13.915
Listen, we cannot trifle with God's holiness.

299
00:15:16.255 --> 00:15:19.195
We can't treat him as if he is not going to be

300
00:15:19.745 --> 00:15:22.265
just his.

301
00:15:22.265 --> 00:15:25.265
People are to be faithful to him.

302
00:15:29.815 --> 00:15:32.155
Now I, I said it earlier that Samuel kind of fades

303
00:15:32.155 --> 00:15:33.715
to the background of the narrative.

304
00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:35.795
From this point forward, we'll see Saul rise.

305
00:15:35.845 --> 00:15:37.635
We'll see some things with David eventually,

306
00:15:37.655 --> 00:15:40.635
but know that Samuel's not absent in this whole process.

307
00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:45.875
In fact, you see what Samuel said in verse 23.

308
00:15:45.985 --> 00:15:49.055
Look at it again. It says,

309
00:15:49.055 --> 00:15:50.815
moreover, as for me, far be it for me

310
00:15:50.815 --> 00:15:53.335
that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray

311
00:15:53.435 --> 00:15:57.255
for you, and I will instruct you in the good

312
00:15:57.315 --> 00:15:58.335
and the right way.

313
00:16:00.455 --> 00:16:03.475
So Samuel doesn't just fade in the background, he shifts.

314
00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:04.955
His role is different.

315
00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:09.845
Now, from this point forward, we see that he is

316
00:16:09.905 --> 00:16:12.605
to fully lean into the role of prophet.

317
00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:15.855
This was his clarified new role.

318
00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:19.535
He kind of played a different judge like role almost king,

319
00:16:19.535 --> 00:16:21.615
like in a sense almost priest like at times

320
00:16:22.195 --> 00:16:24.055
now he's saying, I'm just gonna be the prophet.

321
00:16:25.355 --> 00:16:27.215
My role is to be the prophet.

322
00:16:27.575 --> 00:16:29.295
A prophet was to pray for the nation

323
00:16:31.175 --> 00:16:34.075
and to be the mouthpiece of God, both for the people

324
00:16:34.175 --> 00:16:38.305
and for the king to instruct them

325
00:16:38.305 --> 00:16:39.345
in God's way.

326
00:16:42.015 --> 00:16:44.275
So in essence, what would happen from this point forward is

327
00:16:44.275 --> 00:16:46.475
that the there, there was a split now

328
00:16:47.195 --> 00:16:49.525
between the civic duties of the king

329
00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:52.605
and the spiritual duties of the prophet.

330
00:16:54.425 --> 00:16:56.455
Again, it had kind of been blended together in one person

331
00:16:56.675 --> 00:16:59.095
for a while in some weird ways, but,

332
00:16:59.315 --> 00:17:01.095
but now it's going to split.

333
00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:04.255
And this whole thing called the monarchy would not work

334
00:17:04.915 --> 00:17:07.015
if either side didn't fulfill their function.

335
00:17:09.835 --> 00:17:11.565
That if they, if the prophet doesn't do his job,

336
00:17:11.585 --> 00:17:13.845
the king doesn't do his job the way they're supposed to or,

337
00:17:14.785 --> 00:17:16.765
and this will be kind of foreshadowing,

338
00:17:17.185 --> 00:17:20.885
or if they started to try to cross over into the other role,

339
00:17:22.355 --> 00:17:24.295
if the king started to do some prophet like stuff,

340
00:17:24.315 --> 00:17:26.655
the prophet tried to be the king, like it didn't work.

341
00:17:29.895 --> 00:17:31.315
But this was Samuel's new role.

342
00:17:31.415 --> 00:17:33.595
He was to remind the king, to remind the people

343
00:17:33.905 --> 00:17:36.115
that God was actually still their king.

344
00:17:36.225 --> 00:17:38.995
They had a king on earth, but God still the true king

345
00:17:40.135 --> 00:17:42.835
and that they needed to fulfill the covenant,

346
00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:44.515
the responsibilities of that.

347
00:17:45.025 --> 00:17:46.435
It's what Samuel does here, right?

348
00:17:47.655 --> 00:17:48.995
He instructs them in

349
00:17:49.045 --> 00:17:50.765
what they should be doing and what they shouldn't be.

350
00:17:53.475 --> 00:17:55.735
Yet there's one more thing we see learn in in

351
00:17:55.735 --> 00:17:57.055
this covenant renewal ceremony.

352
00:17:57.055 --> 00:18:01.275
What we learn from it, you see it at the top of your notes,

353
00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:04.315
even I, I put Joel two 13 on there for a reason.

354
00:18:04.415 --> 00:18:07.675
You see this idea in that verse.

355
00:18:07.695 --> 00:18:09.315
You see it in one Samuel 12.

356
00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:13.435
What we learn is that God's mercy is abundant.

357
00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:18.515
We learn that here. As harsh as this sounds,

358
00:18:20.815 --> 00:18:25.415
God's abundant mercy is clear throughout this passage

359
00:18:28.005 --> 00:18:31.535
like we saw in how God responded to the people in Egypt.

360
00:18:31.565 --> 00:18:33.815
When they cried out for freedom

361
00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:35.375
and deliverance, what did he do?

362
00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:36.735
He delivered them.

363
00:18:39.005 --> 00:18:42.065
We saw in how God responded to the people in the land.

364
00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:43.265
They're oppressed by these

365
00:18:43.265 --> 00:18:44.345
enemies that are coming their way.

366
00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:46.865
They cried out to God. What did he do? He delivered them.

367
00:18:49.735 --> 00:18:52.435
He even gave them a king knowing

368
00:18:52.435 --> 00:18:55.155
that in the process they were rejecting him as their king.

369
00:18:55.375 --> 00:18:57.355
He still mercifully gave them a king.

370
00:19:01.045 --> 00:19:03.785
Yet we see it very clearly starting in verse 19.

371
00:19:06.015 --> 00:19:09.505
Remember, they just experienced this storm that was in kind

372
00:19:09.505 --> 00:19:10.705
of an allusion to justice.

373
00:19:13.035 --> 00:19:15.695
They'd seen God's holy power. And what did they do?

374
00:19:15.845 --> 00:19:17.855
They recognized their sin.

375
00:19:19.255 --> 00:19:23.725
Verse 19, the people said to Samuel, pray for your servants

376
00:19:23.725 --> 00:19:27.405
to the Lord your God, that we may not die for we have added

377
00:19:27.585 --> 00:19:32.365
to all our sins, this evil, to ask for ourselves a king.

378
00:19:35.445 --> 00:19:37.695
They recognize their sin. They cried out to God.

379
00:19:37.945 --> 00:19:39.455
Watch God's mercy.

380
00:19:39.675 --> 00:19:43.935
Now, verse 20, Samuel said to the people, do not be afraid.

381
00:19:48.445 --> 00:19:50.385
Do not be afraid. He acknowledged now.

382
00:19:50.525 --> 00:19:51.945
Now he acknowledged they did it

383
00:19:53.175 --> 00:19:55.275
and he acknowledged they shouldn't keep doing it.

384
00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:00.885
But verse 22, here's why they shouldn't fear.

385
00:20:01.235 --> 00:20:06.165
Look at verse 22. For the Lord will not forsake his people

386
00:20:09.815 --> 00:20:11.435
for his great name's sake,

387
00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:17.635
because it has pleased the Lord to make you a people

388
00:20:17.855 --> 00:20:18.955
for himself.

389
00:20:21.105 --> 00:20:22.245
That's mercy, isn't it?

390
00:20:24.235 --> 00:20:25.335
See, here's the definition of mercy,

391
00:20:27.145 --> 00:20:29.485
not giving someone what they deserve.

392
00:20:31.715 --> 00:20:33.825
Grace is giving someone what they don't deserve.

393
00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.305
Mercy is not giving them.

394
00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:41.485
What they do deserve is, is

395
00:20:41.485 --> 00:20:42.885
that not what God did for Israel?

396
00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:47.885
Right? Remember, this is a sinful,

397
00:20:48.965 --> 00:20:50.165
rebellious people

398
00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:54.165
who regularly turn their back on their king.

399
00:20:56.265 --> 00:21:00.635
And what did he do? He mercifully delivered them,

400
00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:03.395
redeemed them, saved them.

401
00:21:04.755 --> 00:21:09.405
That's who God is. This is

402
00:21:09.405 --> 00:21:13.785
what we learned from this whole scene about all who God is.

403
00:21:18.365 --> 00:21:22.355
So cool story, right? Good for them.

404
00:21:25.345 --> 00:21:28.065
What does this have to do with us? Right?

405
00:21:28.065 --> 00:21:29.385
That's the, that's one of the hard parts.

406
00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:30.985
I said this at the very beginning of the series

407
00:21:31.285 --> 00:21:32.665
of dealing with the Old Testaments.

408
00:21:32.665 --> 00:21:36.345
Like, okay, well, got got them where they need to be.

409
00:21:36.345 --> 00:21:39.545
What do we, what about us? How do we apply this?

410
00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:43.345
Like how does this carry forward into

411
00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:45.305
Tuesday afternoon at work

412
00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:47.825
or Saturday night, whenever you're gonna choose to do it?

413
00:21:47.825 --> 00:21:50.865
Like how does this matter? We need to figure that out.

414
00:21:52.965 --> 00:21:54.335
Well, we look for principles, right?

415
00:21:55.955 --> 00:21:58.035
I found at least three you could probably find some more

416
00:21:58.035 --> 00:21:59.875
that we could take away from all of this.

417
00:22:00.815 --> 00:22:03.625
Three principles. Here's the first one,

418
00:22:05.285 --> 00:22:06.745
in faith, we ought

419
00:22:06.765 --> 00:22:11.765
to recount God's goodness

420
00:22:14.955 --> 00:22:16.235
Recount God's goodness.

421
00:22:20.245 --> 00:22:22.865
See, why did Samuel tell them all these old stories?

422
00:22:25.185 --> 00:22:29.235
Because he wanted to reorient their minds around all

423
00:22:29.235 --> 00:22:30.555
that God had done for them.

424
00:22:34.065 --> 00:22:35.885
He wanted to remind them of

425
00:22:36.025 --> 00:22:39.125
how God had delivered their people from slavery in Egypt.

426
00:22:40.265 --> 00:22:41.965
He wanted to remind them of

427
00:22:41.965 --> 00:22:44.525
how God had saved them from their enemies.

428
00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:48.565
And he wanted to remind them that all that deliverance came

429
00:22:49.115 --> 00:22:54.005
when they trusted God alone, when they cried out to God,

430
00:22:54.195 --> 00:22:56.045
when they leaned on God.

431
00:22:56.045 --> 00:23:00.285
Because in the moment they were shaky,

432
00:23:00.285 --> 00:23:02.365
their foundation was shifting.

433
00:23:03.545 --> 00:23:06.125
And he says this to them, saying, all you need to do, guys,

434
00:23:06.945 --> 00:23:08.405
all you need to do is go back

435
00:23:08.405 --> 00:23:12.565
and look at God's goodness to you over and over and over.

436
00:23:12.945 --> 00:23:16.245
And that would reassure their trembling hearts.

437
00:23:21.245 --> 00:23:23.465
Do we not need to do the same thing?

438
00:23:23.645 --> 00:23:28.265
So often in our lives, like we look around

439
00:23:28.405 --> 00:23:29.505
and it starts to get a little

440
00:23:29.555 --> 00:23:30.785
shaky, starts to get a little worried.

441
00:23:30.925 --> 00:23:32.985
We look at our future, we look at the world, we're like,

442
00:23:32.985 --> 00:23:35.305
oh man, this is, this is gonna be bad.

443
00:23:35.525 --> 00:23:38.465
Samuel said, the reason that they asked

444
00:23:38.565 --> 00:23:40.905
for a king in the first place was

445
00:23:40.905 --> 00:23:42.225
because they'd forgotten

446
00:23:42.565 --> 00:23:45.125
how God had delivered them over and over and over, over.

447
00:23:47.615 --> 00:23:51.195
The reason you and I look for replacement kings look

448
00:23:51.215 --> 00:23:55.875
for replacement saviors is because we forget who God is

449
00:23:56.015 --> 00:23:58.715
and what He's done over and over and over in our lives.

450
00:24:02.735 --> 00:24:03.875
We forget that he has

451
00:24:04.155 --> 00:24:07.075
provided for us financially when it sure seemed impossible.

452
00:24:09.635 --> 00:24:11.555
I forget that He has gotten me

453
00:24:11.555 --> 00:24:13.915
through every situation I've ever faced in my life.

454
00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:21.285
You forget that nations and leaders rise

455
00:24:21.465 --> 00:24:24.205
and fall, yet the church stands forever.

456
00:24:27.345 --> 00:24:31.165
And we get shaky and we look and we need a replacement king.

457
00:24:31.185 --> 00:24:32.845
We need a replacement savior.

458
00:24:33.345 --> 00:24:35.725
And, and we, we look for this stuff instead

459
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:37.485
of remembering who God is.

460
00:24:37.505 --> 00:24:41.085
But most of all, here's, I love this phrase from Paul Tripp.

461
00:24:41.475 --> 00:24:43.965
Most of all, we have gospel amnesia

462
00:24:46.945 --> 00:24:49.815
that we forget all that God has done

463
00:24:50.995 --> 00:24:52.615
to save our souls.

464
00:24:54.875 --> 00:24:57.575
The most important thing he's ever done for us.

465
00:24:57.795 --> 00:25:02.335
We forget that if we have placed our faith in Jesus' life,

466
00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:04.135
death, and resurrection in our place,

467
00:25:04.365 --> 00:25:07.375
that he's fully covered our sin forever and ever.

468
00:25:07.635 --> 00:25:09.335
He loves us. He cherishes us.

469
00:25:09.355 --> 00:25:12.535
He knows us, and he's given us a home with him forever.

470
00:25:12.795 --> 00:25:13.815
We forget that.

471
00:25:15.505 --> 00:25:18.005
That's why we sing the gospel here.

472
00:25:18.065 --> 00:25:19.965
That's why we preach the gospel here.

473
00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:21.805
That's why we pray the gospel here.

474
00:25:21.805 --> 00:25:23.405
That's why we talk about it all the time,

475
00:25:23.405 --> 00:25:26.805
because we are prone to forget the works of God

476
00:25:26.805 --> 00:25:28.605
and all that he has done for us.

477
00:25:30.035 --> 00:25:33.015
So when we recount his goodness

478
00:25:33.035 --> 00:25:36.235
to us, it builds our faith.

479
00:25:37.695 --> 00:25:40.195
It builds the faith of those around us as they hear

480
00:25:40.225 --> 00:25:43.915
what God has done over and over and over in his goodness.

481
00:25:47.095 --> 00:25:48.105
Because we believe,

482
00:25:48.105 --> 00:25:51.505
because we have faith, we recount his goodness to us.

483
00:25:55.115 --> 00:25:56.695
Here's a second principle in this chapter.

484
00:25:59.245 --> 00:26:01.025
In life, we are

485
00:26:01.025 --> 00:26:05.835
to obey God's commands in life.

486
00:26:06.015 --> 00:26:08.115
We are to obey God's commands.

487
00:26:08.155 --> 00:26:09.635
I know it seems simplistic,

488
00:26:11.425 --> 00:26:13.525
but it's all over this passage, isn't it?

489
00:26:16.985 --> 00:26:20.755
Just a few things he says, verse 14, fear the Lord.

490
00:26:21.245 --> 00:26:23.635
Serve him. Obey his voice.

491
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:26.355
Don't rebel against the commandment of the Lord.

492
00:26:27.785 --> 00:26:29.695
Verse 15, he actually says the same things,

493
00:26:29.695 --> 00:26:31.535
but he flips it around negatively.

494
00:26:34.155 --> 00:26:37.145
Verse 20, don't turn aside from following the Lord.

495
00:26:37.355 --> 00:26:41.365
Serve the Lord with all your heart. Verse 21.

496
00:26:41.455 --> 00:26:42.885
Don't turn aside from the Lord.

497
00:26:42.925 --> 00:26:44.605
Lord, after all these empty things.

498
00:26:46.835 --> 00:26:49.485
Verse 24, fear the Lord.

499
00:26:49.615 --> 00:26:51.525
Serve him faithfully with all your heart.

500
00:26:52.335 --> 00:26:53.925
Verse 25, he flips it around,

501
00:26:53.925 --> 00:26:55.085
says, here's what happens if you don't.

502
00:26:55.085 --> 00:26:57.245
Right? It's all over this.

503
00:26:57.355 --> 00:27:02.125
It's the same thing that Jesus taught us as Christians.

504
00:27:05.855 --> 00:27:09.875
Matthew 22 verses 37 through 40,

505
00:27:10.345 --> 00:27:12.835
what we now know to be the great commandment,

506
00:27:14.525 --> 00:27:17.395
Jesus says this, you shall love the Lord your God

507
00:27:17.425 --> 00:27:19.675
with all your heart and with all your soul

508
00:27:19.695 --> 00:27:20.715
and with all your mind.

509
00:27:21.465 --> 00:27:23.435
This is the great and first commandment.

510
00:27:23.575 --> 00:27:24.995
And a second is like it.

511
00:27:25.295 --> 00:27:26.595
You shall love your neighbor

512
00:27:26.815 --> 00:27:29.475
as yourself on these two commandments.

513
00:27:29.695 --> 00:27:32.155
Depend all the law and the prophets.

514
00:27:36.185 --> 00:27:39.165
Sounds like the same thing Samuel says in one Samuel 12.

515
00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:42.155
Love the Lord your God with everything you are

516
00:27:42.205 --> 00:27:44.715
above everything else, and love your neighbor as yourself.

517
00:27:44.715 --> 00:27:46.315
That's all it takes.

518
00:27:48.035 --> 00:27:51.285
It's the same thing that Jesus said in Matthew 28,

519
00:27:51.355 --> 00:27:53.165
that is a part of disciple making.

520
00:27:53.265 --> 00:27:56.805
He says, teach them to obey all that I've commanded you.

521
00:27:58.965 --> 00:28:02.895
It's even in John 1415 where Jesus said, if you love me,

522
00:28:03.115 --> 00:28:04.575
you will keep my commandments.

523
00:28:06.625 --> 00:28:08.445
He says that to them basically

524
00:28:08.465 --> 00:28:10.765
as an expectation you should obey

525
00:28:11.105 --> 00:28:13.805
and a promise that you will,

526
00:28:15.075 --> 00:28:16.885
that God will do something in your heart,

527
00:28:16.955 --> 00:28:20.695
that he will lead you to obedience of his commandments.

528
00:28:23.425 --> 00:28:26.165
Here's the principle in one Samuel 12 is he says it over

529
00:28:26.165 --> 00:28:29.285
and over, that life goes better when we serve the Lord

530
00:28:29.285 --> 00:28:31.485
with all our hearts, when we obey him.

531
00:28:33.135 --> 00:28:35.395
I'm not saying life will be perfect when you do that,

532
00:28:37.305 --> 00:28:38.925
but it sure goes better.

533
00:28:39.225 --> 00:28:41.845
The world is fallen, your body's broken.

534
00:28:42.265 --> 00:28:45.085
It won't work perfectly, but it sure will go better.

535
00:28:48.415 --> 00:28:51.015
'cause we need to remember what Galatians six says.

536
00:28:52.935 --> 00:28:54.235
Do not be deceived.

537
00:28:54.415 --> 00:28:59.045
God is not mocked for whatever one sows, plants

538
00:28:59.555 --> 00:29:04.025
that will he also reap for the one who sows

539
00:29:04.025 --> 00:29:06.705
to his own flesh, will from the flesh reap corruption,

540
00:29:06.965 --> 00:29:10.185
but the one who sows to the spirit will from the spirit

541
00:29:10.705 --> 00:29:12.385
reap eternal life.

542
00:29:14.835 --> 00:29:16.355
Holiness matters, right?

543
00:29:19.135 --> 00:29:21.815
Holiness matters. So here's the challenge.

544
00:29:22.025 --> 00:29:26.035
Let's be marked not just

545
00:29:26.095 --> 00:29:27.235
by what we are against.

546
00:29:29.465 --> 00:29:31.015
Let's not just be marked by

547
00:29:31.435 --> 00:29:33.855
how loudly we talk about politics on social media.

548
00:29:35.705 --> 00:29:38.775
Let's be known by how faithfully

549
00:29:39.475 --> 00:29:42.525
we obey all that Jesus commanded us to do.

550
00:29:45.165 --> 00:29:49.635
That would be shocking to the world, man.

551
00:29:49.635 --> 00:29:51.235
They really believe this stuff, don't they?

552
00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:55.545
They really obey this. It's amazing.

553
00:29:59.585 --> 00:30:01.685
Yet here, here's what I felt as I wrote that,

554
00:30:02.595 --> 00:30:04.685
that section about obeying his commands.

555
00:30:04.845 --> 00:30:08.555
I, I had kind of a,

556
00:30:09.715 --> 00:30:12.355
a latent discouragement even as I wrote that.

557
00:30:14.225 --> 00:30:16.585
I know it's true. I know I'm supposed to, I know it's right,

558
00:30:17.835 --> 00:30:20.935
but I I, I felt discouraged even as I wrote it

559
00:30:20.935 --> 00:30:22.215
and even as I say it,

560
00:30:22.215 --> 00:30:24.855
because I know how poorly I do at that.

561
00:30:28.665 --> 00:30:31.315
I, I praise God

562
00:30:31.315 --> 00:30:34.075
that it's not blatant sin anymore, right?

563
00:30:35.305 --> 00:30:38.675
Used to be, not anymore just blatant sin.

564
00:30:38.775 --> 00:30:40.675
Praise God that that's not there.

565
00:30:40.855 --> 00:30:43.395
But now it's a lot more subtle.

566
00:30:45.985 --> 00:30:49.565
It, it's the good. I'm not doing that.

567
00:30:49.565 --> 00:30:53.705
I know I'm supposed to. It's the love

568
00:30:53.705 --> 00:30:56.145
that I'm not showing to someone when I know I should be.

569
00:30:57.495 --> 00:31:00.115
That's that's there. It's under the, the layers.

570
00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:05.015
It's there though. And so I look at one Samuel 12,

571
00:31:05.215 --> 00:31:06.535
I look at Galatians six.

572
00:31:07.015 --> 00:31:09.615
I know that sometimes my motivations are bad

573
00:31:09.615 --> 00:31:10.935
for even doing good things,

574
00:31:11.355 --> 00:31:14.295
and I know I'm not fully obeying all of his commands.

575
00:31:14.315 --> 00:31:17.055
And so I'm discouraged by that. So what's left for me?

576
00:31:20.405 --> 00:31:21.855
Love the Lord, you, God, with all your heart.

577
00:31:23.315 --> 00:31:26.375
I'm like, man, this morning I didn't even do that. Right?

578
00:31:26.525 --> 00:31:29.955
Like, what's left?

579
00:31:32.835 --> 00:31:35.815
Here's the prime, the the final principle today, praise God

580
00:31:35.815 --> 00:31:37.855
for this in sin,

581
00:31:38.305 --> 00:31:43.215
trust God's mercy in sin.

582
00:31:43.385 --> 00:31:45.015
Trust God's mercy.

583
00:31:45.085 --> 00:31:48.735
When you're confronted with your sin that is face to face

584
00:31:48.735 --> 00:31:53.655
with you every day, trust, lean into God's mercy.

585
00:31:56.965 --> 00:32:01.095
You remember what happened for them in one Samuel 12, they

586
00:32:01.655 --> 00:32:02.695
recognize their sin.

587
00:32:03.805 --> 00:32:06.335
They cried out to the Lord,

588
00:32:06.795 --> 00:32:10.655
and Samuel reminded them of God's mercy to them.

589
00:32:12.205 --> 00:32:14.665
And again, don't forget who these people were.

590
00:32:16.065 --> 00:32:18.445
This was Israel who over

591
00:32:18.705 --> 00:32:21.525
and over had forsaken God.

592
00:32:22.145 --> 00:32:24.205
Yet still, it says very clearly,

593
00:32:24.465 --> 00:32:28.525
God will not forsake his people, the people he was pleased

594
00:32:29.025 --> 00:32:30.525
to make for himself.

595
00:32:32.255 --> 00:32:34.705
What grace and mercy, right?

596
00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:37.465
Do you see how he didn't give them what they deserved?

597
00:32:37.645 --> 00:32:42.125
He could've wiped him off the, the face of the map said,

598
00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:43.485
you've all turned away from me.

599
00:32:43.705 --> 00:32:46.285
You all deserve my wrath. And you're done.

600
00:32:48.035 --> 00:32:51.795
And what did he do? No, no. He delivered.

601
00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:54.085
He redeemed, he saved.

602
00:32:57.365 --> 00:33:00.425
And listen, that's even more true for you today.

603
00:33:00.605 --> 00:33:03.225
If you have turned from your sin and yourself,

604
00:33:03.485 --> 00:33:06.705
and you have placed your faith in the grace

605
00:33:06.765 --> 00:33:10.385
and mercy of Jesus in your place, what that means is

606
00:33:10.385 --> 00:33:11.385
that you are his.

607
00:33:11.525 --> 00:33:15.695
Now, what that means is that he has made you,

608
00:33:15.915 --> 00:33:18.975
he has made you a new creation through the life, death,

609
00:33:18.975 --> 00:33:21.135
and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

610
00:33:21.315 --> 00:33:23.215
It means you are His.

611
00:33:24.625 --> 00:33:26.525
And listen to how one Peter two says this,

612
00:33:27.065 --> 00:33:30.925
you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,

613
00:33:31.325 --> 00:33:35.725
a holy nation of people for his own possession,

614
00:33:36.925 --> 00:33:39.185
so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him

615
00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:42.625
who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.

616
00:33:42.625 --> 00:33:45.105
Listen to this. Once you were not a people,

617
00:33:45.445 --> 00:33:46.985
but now you are God's people.

618
00:33:47.575 --> 00:33:49.905
Once you had not received mercy,

619
00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:53.825
but now you have received mercy.

620
00:33:55.245 --> 00:33:57.145
So friend, lean into that mercy,

621
00:33:59.295 --> 00:34:01.185
lean into that.

622
00:34:01.225 --> 00:34:03.985
Like Joel two says on your notes, return to him.

623
00:34:06.195 --> 00:34:10.895
Return to him remembering who God is, remembering

624
00:34:11.035 --> 00:34:14.095
who you are, and remembering whose you are.

625
00:34:14.645 --> 00:34:16.215
Amen. Return to him.

626
00:34:18.665 --> 00:34:23.065
Remember, he has made you His by the mercy

627
00:34:23.525 --> 00:34:26.025
of Jesus', precious blood shed for you.

628
00:34:27.795 --> 00:34:32.005
That was the purchase price to make you his

629
00:34:32.265 --> 00:34:33.805
and to make you new.

630
00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:36.325
Which leads us back to one Samuel 1222.

631
00:34:36.665 --> 00:34:39.965
The Lord will not forsake his people.

632
00:34:43.575 --> 00:34:45.395
And do you remember why He wouldn't

633
00:34:48.655 --> 00:34:50.675
for his great names' sake.

634
00:34:52.695 --> 00:34:55.635
He will not forsake his people for his great names' sake,

635
00:34:55.935 --> 00:34:57.115
for his glory.

636
00:34:57.115 --> 00:34:58.155
Hear me, hear me.

637
00:34:58.575 --> 00:35:01.195
You might be really on the edge of this right now

638
00:35:02.095 --> 00:35:03.355
for his glory.

639
00:35:04.485 --> 00:35:06.825
He will not kick you out when you sin.

640
00:35:09.475 --> 00:35:12.915
You catch that 'cause you're going

641
00:35:12.915 --> 00:35:15.395
to, he knew you would.

642
00:35:17.645 --> 00:35:21.885
Yet, if you are his, he will not kick you out

643
00:35:23.155 --> 00:35:24.175
for his names sake.

644
00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:30.225
So hear me, let that draw you in today.

645
00:35:33.125 --> 00:35:35.385
Let that draw you into his mercy

646
00:35:39.215 --> 00:35:43.655
and then let that compel us to live a life

647
00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:47.995
that's completely different because of his mercy.

648
00:35:50.505 --> 00:35:52.295
Let's pray. Ask him for that help.

649
00:35:52.515 --> 00:35:54.135
God, I thank you for your word.

650
00:35:57.585 --> 00:36:02.065
I thank you that you have the

651
00:36:03.285 --> 00:36:06.165
infinite level of mercy that we can't even fathom

652
00:36:08.315 --> 00:36:09.335
for sinners like us.

653
00:36:11.575 --> 00:36:16.455
Thank you God. And I know there can be

654
00:36:19.035 --> 00:36:20.315
a, a heavy weight of shame

655
00:36:20.315 --> 00:36:22.355
that the enemy tosses on our shoulders every

656
00:36:22.355 --> 00:36:23.515
moment of our lives.

657
00:36:24.745 --> 00:36:26.125
And he's not lying to us.

658
00:36:26.665 --> 00:36:28.285
God, we, we acknowledge that

659
00:36:28.285 --> 00:36:30.925
what the enemy tells us we've done is true.

660
00:36:32.855 --> 00:36:36.875
Yet confession, Jesus confession is agreeing with that

661
00:36:36.895 --> 00:36:39.195
and saying, it's yours, God, we give it to you.

662
00:36:39.495 --> 00:36:40.595
We run back to you

663
00:36:40.745 --> 00:36:43.915
that your mercy means you don't forsake your people.

664
00:36:43.915 --> 00:36:47.555
And if we've trusted you, God, I pray for our faith family

665
00:36:47.555 --> 00:36:51.335
that we would run to you in faith.

666
00:36:52.335 --> 00:36:55.055
Recounting your goodness, walking in holiness,

667
00:36:55.395 --> 00:36:56.615
yet leaning on your mercy.

668
00:36:59.195 --> 00:37:02.725
Thank you for that grace. Hope us see that today.

669
00:37:02.865 --> 00:37:05.425
In Jesus' name. Amen.

670
00:37:08.045 --> 00:37:10.105
Listen, all of that is.
