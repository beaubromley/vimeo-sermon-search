WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.145 --> 00:00:01.475
Well, good morning church family.

2
00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:04.435
It is, uh, the month we're celebrating our 60th

3
00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:05.475
anniversary as a church.

4
00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.635
And so all month you're gonna get to see things like

5
00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:09.515
that history and, uh,

6
00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:12.835
insights from people along the way who've been a part

7
00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:13.875
of this for a really long time.

8
00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:15.195
All culminating at the end of the month,

9
00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:18.195
we're gonna celebrate in a big way that last Sunday

10
00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:19.995
and even that Saturday night before.

11
00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:22.395
Uh, before we get into God's word today, I want us

12
00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:24.795
to just look back for a second, not 60 years ago,

13
00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:25.875
but just to a week ago.

14
00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:29.035
Uh, last week was such a big weekend with Good Friday

15
00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:31.715
and with Easter Sunday, and even Wednesday night

16
00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:32.955
before that with Marketplace.

17
00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.915
And there was so much that was just stunning about

18
00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:37.275
those few days, right?

19
00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:39.515
I mean, when we sit back and look and examine

20
00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:40.835
and reflect, we get

21
00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:43.355
to see such incredible things that God did.

22
00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:46.715
Uh, for example, on Friday, I talked to roughly half

23
00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:47.755
of the people that came through.

24
00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:49.675
I was on this side as people were entering.

25
00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:52.995
And, uh, of the 3000 people that came through that day,

26
00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:56.075
I estimated about 40% of them were first timers

27
00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:57.755
going through Good Friday.

28
00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:00.395
That's a big deal because of what it means

29
00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:02.595
and how that impacts the lives.

30
00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.715
And then last Sunday, uh, if you were here,

31
00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:07.075
especially at the nine 30,

32
00:01:07.285 --> 00:01:09.835
there were people sitting along the walls and it was crazy.

33
00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:12.915
But, uh, our Easter attendance this year, as opposed

34
00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:17.115
to last year was about 17% increase year over year.

35
00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:19.715
And so that's just amazing what God's doing.

36
00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:23.835
And I say that not to in, in any way brag about what God

37
00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:25.035
or about what we've done.

38
00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:28.635
It's because this is what God has done in the sense

39
00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:31.355
that the people were showing up not for a, a circus

40
00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.435
or a performance or anything.

41
00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:35.115
It was for the gospel, right?

42
00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:37.755
Like Good Friday, walking through it is straight

43
00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:39.595
Christ and I crucified.

44
00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:41.915
And then you see, Sunday, what we talked about,

45
00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.275
it was a normal Sunday for us, but it was Christ

46
00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:46.075
and I crucified again.

47
00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:48.275
And so that's what's beautiful to me about that.

48
00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:50.435
So what we wanted to do is just say a big thank

49
00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:51.555
you to everyone involved.

50
00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:54.355
If you served Wednesday night with the marketplace,

51
00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:57.595
or Friday or Sunday in any way, setting up, tearing down,

52
00:01:57.955 --> 00:02:00.955
greeting, smiling at kids, praying, whatever it was

53
00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:04.275
over the last week, last week, I want you

54
00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:07.155
to stand up right now and we can honor you for the effort

55
00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:09.995
because it is so much work of what happened last week.

56
00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:13.355
So please stand if you have like there was more than two

57
00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:14.555
right there.

58
00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:15.995
Please stand. Thank you.

59
00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:21.875
Yes, if you did, it takes so many people

60
00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:24.795
to do all of those things and to make it work.

61
00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:28.595
So praise God for that. But it was a sacrifice of praise.

62
00:02:28.755 --> 00:02:30.555
I know you did it with that spirit.

63
00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:33.475
Uh, just as another side note, I wanna remind you

64
00:02:33.475 --> 00:02:37.075
that every Sunday is Easter Sunday in a sense, right?

65
00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:38.915
Resurrection day. So

66
00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:42.755
what I felt coming in last Sunday was this anticipation kind

67
00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:44.995
of an expectation that God's gonna work and do something.

68
00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:47.635
Let's come every week with that, right?

69
00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.795
Because it's still the same truth

70
00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:50.995
that we're preaching every week.

71
00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:54.395
We're talking about the same songs we're singing every week

72
00:02:54.485 --> 00:02:56.635
about the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.

73
00:02:56.735 --> 00:03:00.485
That's what I would hope we can come into with that way,

74
00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:04.365
because God is faithful to that.

75
00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:10.045
He is faithful, is that not just a beautiful phrase and,

76
00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:13.365
and that word faithful, it means that he is dependable,

77
00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:18.365
he's trustworthy, he's someone we can put our confidence in

78
00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:21.585
because that's who he is.

79
00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:26.265
That's what he is. Like. He can't be anything but faithful.

80
00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:29.655
And we're gonna celebrate that over the next month of

81
00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:31.135
what he's done over the last 60 years,

82
00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:32.335
been faithful to this church.

83
00:03:33.355 --> 00:03:37.775
But what I hope to see throughout this series in the book

84
00:03:37.775 --> 00:03:40.015
of one Corinthians, is that he continues

85
00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:41.255
to be faithful every day.

86
00:03:42.165 --> 00:03:43.455
It's not just we look back

87
00:03:43.475 --> 00:03:47.655
and see what he's done, it's he's still to you

88
00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:48.975
and to me, faithful.

89
00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:51.295
And we'll see that as we go.

90
00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:53.775
So take your copy of God's word, turn with me to the book

91
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:57.135
of one Corinthians, the first letter

92
00:03:57.715 --> 00:03:59.335
to the Corinthians in the New Testament.

93
00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:03.415
You can find it there. First Corinthians, we're not going

94
00:04:03.415 --> 00:04:04.735
through the whole book in seven weeks.

95
00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:07.575
Don't worry about that. But what we're going to do is, what,

96
00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:11.095
what I did is I, I looked through the book using software

97
00:04:11.155 --> 00:04:13.775
and found every time the word faithful

98
00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:17.375
or faith shows up in this letter.

99
00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:20.295
It's probably more than just seven, but,

100
00:04:20.395 --> 00:04:23.495
but these seven are the sections

101
00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:25.575
that we're gonna study in this series, looking at

102
00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:27.735
God's faithfulness to us

103
00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:33.285
or how his faithfulness to us then

104
00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:35.965
fuels our faithfulness to him.

105
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.805
How we can put our faith in him. We can be faithful to him.

106
00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:43.085
That's the dynamic of this relationship as we go.

107
00:04:44.415 --> 00:04:46.795
And so today we're gonna start in one Corinthians chapter

108
00:04:46.935 --> 00:04:48.195
two, big number two.

109
00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:51.075
The first five verses is

110
00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:53.995
what we're gonna see this start with today.

111
00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:56.155
By the way, this is the first passage I ever preached

112
00:04:56.155 --> 00:04:57.195
here six years ago.

113
00:04:57.815 --> 00:04:59.875
Uh, if you remember, if you were here at the time,

114
00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:02.515
this is a football, you remember that Vince Lombardi, right?

115
00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:06.515
Uh, and then also that I'm just a table waiter serving you

116
00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.515
don't remember me, remember the chef, right?

117
00:05:08.515 --> 00:05:11.235
That was the whole, anyway, that was a long time ago.

118
00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:12.875
So we're gonna read it

119
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.395
and then we're gonna get into it here.

120
00:05:15.455 --> 00:05:16.955
One Corinthians two, one through five,

121
00:05:19.015 --> 00:05:21.435
and I, when I came to you, brothers,

122
00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:24.355
did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God

123
00:05:24.385 --> 00:05:26.115
with lofty speech or wisdom.

124
00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:31.235
For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ

125
00:05:31.255 --> 00:05:32.315
and Him crucify.

126
00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:36.085
I was with you in weakness and in fear.

127
00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:39.575
And in much trembling my speech

128
00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:42.735
and my message were not implausible words of wisdom,

129
00:05:43.755 --> 00:05:45.455
but in demonstration of the spirit

130
00:05:45.715 --> 00:05:47.535
and of power, so

131
00:05:47.845 --> 00:05:51.205
that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men,

132
00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:53.565
but in the power of God.

133
00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:56.835
Lord, that's what we want.

134
00:05:58.915 --> 00:06:03.195
We want demonstration

135
00:06:03.535 --> 00:06:05.835
of the power of the Spirit of God,

136
00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:10.715
lives transformed families, restored

137
00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:15.795
people walking in repentance, mission going.

138
00:06:15.935 --> 00:06:19.195
We want the demonstration of the power of the Spirit.

139
00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:24.655
So Lord, help us see it.

140
00:06:24.915 --> 00:06:26.855
Change our hearts where we need it today

141
00:06:28.425 --> 00:06:30.195
because you are faithful.

142
00:06:32.135 --> 00:06:35.955
We can trust you, help help us trust you more

143
00:06:35.975 --> 00:06:38.215
God, in Jesus' name.

144
00:06:38.845 --> 00:06:42.055
Amen. So what do we need

145
00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:44.255
to remember today from this passage?

146
00:06:44.325 --> 00:06:45.935
Well, it's actually a quote from a different

147
00:06:45.935 --> 00:06:46.975
part of a different letter.

148
00:06:47.475 --> 00:06:49.815
Second Corinthians, the first letter here,

149
00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:52.055
there's another letter that we call Second Corinthians.

150
00:06:52.805 --> 00:06:56.615
It's actually a quote from there where Paul wrote this,

151
00:06:57.395 --> 00:06:58.695
for when I am weak,

152
00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:04.175
then I'm strong boiling it down.

153
00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:08.415
If that's the only thing you remember today, when I am weak,

154
00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:11.575
then I am strong.

155
00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:15.445
That's quite the paradox, isn't it?

156
00:07:16.755 --> 00:07:20.245
Like how can those two things both be true at the same time?

157
00:07:22.735 --> 00:07:25.985
Plus, that verse is so counterintuitive to the ways

158
00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:29.705
of our world and even to our own flesh

159
00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:33.935
that both say, man, I gotta be strong.

160
00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:38.635
I gotta have it all together. I gotta be impressive.

161
00:07:40.415 --> 00:07:42.015
I need to put this best foot forward.

162
00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:46.885
And then even our flesh inside of ourselves, we say, man,

163
00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.045
I can't show weakness.

164
00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:52.245
Like even inside, I can't show anything weakness.

165
00:07:52.245 --> 00:07:55.125
And so what it does is it prompts me to look in the mirror

166
00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.805
and declare I'm good enough, I'm smart enough,

167
00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.405
and dog on it, people like me, right?

168
00:08:01.405 --> 00:08:05.045
Like that's what we say. We have to tell ourselves

169
00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:07.005
that we gotta, we gotta buckle down

170
00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:09.325
and strengthen up and say, here we are.

171
00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:11.005
I've got this handled.

172
00:08:11.745 --> 00:08:16.125
That's why we need to first understand who we truly are,

173
00:08:18.145 --> 00:08:19.795
because that's the way of the world,

174
00:08:19.855 --> 00:08:21.035
that's the way of our flesh.

175
00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:23.475
We've got to understand who we truly are.

176
00:08:23.535 --> 00:08:25.035
That's the first piece of this,

177
00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:27.995
especially in relation to who God is.

178
00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:30.275
We better understand who we are.

179
00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:34.445
I want just to stop for a second.

180
00:08:34.605 --> 00:08:36.565
I want you to think about how you view yourself.

181
00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:42.775
Like when you think about yourself, what's the first thing

182
00:08:43.165 --> 00:08:44.735
that comes to mind?

183
00:08:44.765 --> 00:08:47.015
What do you think about yourself?

184
00:08:47.155 --> 00:08:52.095
Is it positive or is it overly critical?

185
00:08:53.945 --> 00:08:56.055
Kind of just analyzing that, thinking about

186
00:08:56.065 --> 00:08:58.055
where you stand out here is the reality.

187
00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:00.095
Some of that comes from the way you were talked about

188
00:09:00.235 --> 00:09:02.735
by your parents or your siblings when you were growing up.

189
00:09:03.635 --> 00:09:04.895
We carry this baggage.

190
00:09:05.115 --> 00:09:09.415
We have this sense that, that what we were kind of portrayed

191
00:09:09.435 --> 00:09:12.895
to be by people that loved us or supposedly loved us.

192
00:09:12.915 --> 00:09:14.975
At least we carry that in.

193
00:09:14.975 --> 00:09:18.455
And so some of us walk with very negative views

194
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:21.175
of ourselves simply because of the way we grew up.

195
00:09:23.905 --> 00:09:27.085
Or somebody might feel like I'm, I'm not worth anything,

196
00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:30.055
because that's really what you were told.

197
00:09:32.525 --> 00:09:35.065
Now, lemme just take a side note here for a second.

198
00:09:36.165 --> 00:09:39.065
That's a lie straight from the pit of hell. Okay?

199
00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:44.095
First of all, think about it. You're an image bearer of God.

200
00:09:46.995 --> 00:09:49.665
That's big. And if you're a believer,

201
00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:53.165
God died for you.

202
00:09:55.205 --> 00:09:56.465
That's value, isn't it?

203
00:09:57.335 --> 00:10:00.315
Like we are only seeing something

204
00:10:00.315 --> 00:10:02.555
as valuable when something's, when someone's willing

205
00:10:02.555 --> 00:10:07.145
to pay a certain amount for it, he gave his life

206
00:10:07.165 --> 00:10:08.745
for you believer.

207
00:10:09.555 --> 00:10:12.655
That's value. So don't believe the lie

208
00:10:12.655 --> 00:10:13.855
that your parents told you

209
00:10:13.855 --> 00:10:17.655
or that society told you your valuable.

210
00:10:20.205 --> 00:10:22.465
So some of us might have this picture in ourselves

211
00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:23.905
that we think we're worth nothing

212
00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:26.225
or we're we're this lowest of the low.

213
00:10:26.285 --> 00:10:28.265
But, but the flip side is also true.

214
00:10:28.285 --> 00:10:29.625
And this may be even more true.

215
00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:31.825
I'm not sure of the statistics exactly,

216
00:10:31.925 --> 00:10:34.225
but some of us actually have a very inflated view

217
00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:38.345
of ourselves that we think we're pretty awesome

218
00:10:38.445 --> 00:10:39.585
and we want you to know about it.

219
00:10:39.585 --> 00:10:42.225
We're kinda like this male peacock, strutting

220
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.305
around preening and saying, look at me.

221
00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:47.185
Look how awesome I am. Look at how beautiful this is.

222
00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:53.145
In fact, I, uh, I once saw this parody TV commercial,

223
00:10:54.245 --> 00:10:57.105
uh, this was a, at a sermon illustration thing,

224
00:10:57.105 --> 00:10:59.545
but it was for a CD called Me Worship.

225
00:11:01.325 --> 00:11:04.225
And it included hits like how great

226
00:11:05.105 --> 00:11:07.145
I am seeing with me.

227
00:11:07.205 --> 00:11:11.625
How great, like that's on there or there is none like me.

228
00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:16.225
No one else can do everything like I do, right?

229
00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:17.705
That's, and those are the hits

230
00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:20.985
that we would say on this me worship idea.

231
00:11:21.005 --> 00:11:22.025
Here's the problem with that.

232
00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:24.745
There's a lot of problems with that. But here's the problem.

233
00:11:26.325 --> 00:11:28.185
Romans 12, three commands us.

234
00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:30.665
Do not think of yourself more

235
00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:31.705
highly than you ought to think.

236
00:11:32.745 --> 00:11:37.215
I love how Philip translated that verse.

237
00:11:37.435 --> 00:11:41.255
Do not cherish exaggerated ideas of yourself

238
00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:42.655
or your importance.

239
00:11:44.655 --> 00:11:45.995
Man, we sure do that, don't we?

240
00:11:49.945 --> 00:11:51.605
But that's exactly what Paul's saying here.

241
00:11:51.675 --> 00:11:52.965
It's why he came to Corinth

242
00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:55.125
and the way that he came to this city,

243
00:11:55.955 --> 00:11:58.845
because listen, if anyone had the ability to think highly

244
00:11:58.865 --> 00:12:00.445
of themselves, it was Paul.

245
00:12:02.405 --> 00:12:03.725
I mean, in the Jewish world,

246
00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:06.405
this guy's letter jacket was packed, right?

247
00:12:06.405 --> 00:12:07.925
You know what I mean by that, right? It was full.

248
00:12:08.265 --> 00:12:11.245
He was, he was the top of the top, right.

249
00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:15.645
Acts 22, verse three says, he was educated at the feet

250
00:12:15.645 --> 00:12:18.925
of a prominent Jewish teacher in Jerusalem, strictly

251
00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:21.125
zealous for God.

252
00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:24.605
Even this, he says in Philippians chapter three,

253
00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:29.645
he describes his, his history circumcised on the eighth day.

254
00:12:29.645 --> 00:12:32.925
That was exactly when you should of the people of Israel,

255
00:12:32.945 --> 00:12:37.885
of the tribe of Benjamin, even a Hebrew of Hebrews as

256
00:12:37.905 --> 00:12:40.965
to the law of Pharisee, meaning the top of the top as

257
00:12:40.985 --> 00:12:43.045
to zeal, a persecutor of the church.

258
00:12:43.045 --> 00:12:45.365
Nobody else did that as to righteousness under the law,

259
00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:50.055
blameless like this guy was the valedictorian.

260
00:12:50.915 --> 00:12:53.055
He was Allstate, if you want to go that way, right?

261
00:12:53.075 --> 00:12:57.685
He was the top even more than that.

262
00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:01.315
This guy had the already ascended.

263
00:13:01.325 --> 00:13:04.915
Jesus, meet him on the road, change his heart

264
00:13:05.015 --> 00:13:06.595
and turn him into the greatest missionary,

265
00:13:06.595 --> 00:13:10.935
the world's ever known Yet.

266
00:13:10.965 --> 00:13:12.375
Look at how Paul viewed

267
00:13:12.485 --> 00:13:16.255
himself in verse one.

268
00:13:16.285 --> 00:13:19.015
What did he say? I didn't use lofty speech

269
00:13:19.035 --> 00:13:21.775
or wisdom, meaning this like

270
00:13:22.565 --> 00:13:24.135
flowery way of arguing.

271
00:13:24.795 --> 00:13:26.215
And those, by the way, were traits

272
00:13:26.215 --> 00:13:29.575
that were valued in Corinth because they loved debating.

273
00:13:30.565 --> 00:13:32.055
They were looking for new ideas

274
00:13:32.155 --> 00:13:35.535
and people who were the best rhetorical devices, all of

275
00:13:35.535 --> 00:13:36.575
that's what they wanted.

276
00:13:36.675 --> 00:13:39.535
And he says, no, no, no, I'm not gonna use that.

277
00:13:39.595 --> 00:13:43.945
In fact, he saw himself in weakness, fear,

278
00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:45.945
and much trembling.

279
00:13:48.615 --> 00:13:52.155
Now, what we know about Paul, he probably had some kind

280
00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:54.195
of debilitating illness or injury.

281
00:13:54.785 --> 00:13:56.595
This is the, uh, thorn in the flesh

282
00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:57.835
in second Corinthians 12.

283
00:13:57.835 --> 00:13:59.635
We're not sure what it was, but it could have been a

284
00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:02.755
physical thing, so that most likely factored in here.

285
00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:06.195
We also know he was pretty unimpressive physically.

286
00:14:07.015 --> 00:14:08.635
He wasn't a great speaker

287
00:14:09.455 --> 00:14:11.555
that's said elsewhere in second Corinthians.

288
00:14:14.215 --> 00:14:15.515
But then he also,

289
00:14:18.185 --> 00:14:20.565
it probably also dealt with his emotional condition

290
00:14:20.565 --> 00:14:22.205
as he came to Corinth the first time.

291
00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:25.165
See, he had just come through on his missionary journey,

292
00:14:25.195 --> 00:14:28.645
come through Thessalonica, come through Berea, and,

293
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.845
and what he had experienced, there was hostility

294
00:14:31.845 --> 00:14:33.805
after hostility after hostility.

295
00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:34.885
And it didn't go well.

296
00:14:34.985 --> 00:14:38.685
He wasn't experiencing a great ministry fruit.

297
00:14:38.785 --> 00:14:41.645
He was just getting beat up literally at times.

298
00:14:43.735 --> 00:14:46.515
And so he might've walked into Corinth feeling like things

299
00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:47.835
weren't working very well,

300
00:14:49.105 --> 00:14:50.845
or maybe this, this thing's,

301
00:14:50.845 --> 00:14:52.605
this ministry thing isn't really working out.

302
00:14:52.605 --> 00:14:53.805
Maybe I need to do something else

303
00:14:56.725 --> 00:14:58.275
where he might be tempted to think

304
00:14:58.275 --> 00:15:00.515
that this really isn't worth it if I have to go

305
00:15:00.515 --> 00:15:01.715
through all this and I don't even get

306
00:15:01.715 --> 00:15:02.795
to see much of anything.

307
00:15:02.865 --> 00:15:04.195
Have you ever been there before?

308
00:15:07.275 --> 00:15:10.645
Have you ever been where you're not seeing any fruit

309
00:15:10.705 --> 00:15:12.165
or much fruit at least?

310
00:15:14.325 --> 00:15:17.025
And it just seems like, man, I'm getting harder

311
00:15:17.085 --> 00:15:20.705
to share the gospel, to do ministry, to go serve.

312
00:15:21.965 --> 00:15:24.705
It just feels like I can't do it anymore. I'm dry.

313
00:15:24.935 --> 00:15:26.465
It's I'm sad.

314
00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:31.735
So you just want to give up and you're weak

315
00:15:31.835 --> 00:15:33.535
and you're fearful of doing it again

316
00:15:33.535 --> 00:15:34.855
because you're gonna get hurt again.

317
00:15:35.115 --> 00:15:39.395
Or you, that was Paul here, right?

318
00:15:41.495 --> 00:15:44.395
Was with you in weakness, fear, trembling.

319
00:15:47.005 --> 00:15:49.185
But really when you think about it, that was Paul. Yes.

320
00:15:49.205 --> 00:15:51.865
But really that's all of us all the time.

321
00:15:55.865 --> 00:16:00.085
See, truly at our core, in ourselves, we are weak.

322
00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:04.555
Like we're trying to think, okay, who are we really?

323
00:16:04.575 --> 00:16:05.595
We, we gotta remember

324
00:16:05.595 --> 00:16:06.955
who we are, especially in relation to God.

325
00:16:06.975 --> 00:16:08.355
But, but who are we first?

326
00:16:08.455 --> 00:16:11.115
We have to remember, we are weak people.

327
00:16:15.045 --> 00:16:17.895
This is what Psalm 73 reminds us that our flesh

328
00:16:17.995 --> 00:16:19.415
and our hearts may fail.

329
00:16:22.995 --> 00:16:25.935
Isaiah verse 30 of chapter 40, it says,

330
00:16:25.935 --> 00:16:28.615
even youths shall faint and be weary

331
00:16:28.615 --> 00:16:30.415
and young men shall fall exhausted.

332
00:16:32.955 --> 00:16:35.505
Psalm 1 0 3 looks back to God creating humans,

333
00:16:35.565 --> 00:16:37.145
and it reminds us the word dust.

334
00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:40.585
Not impressive. We're dust.

335
00:16:44.335 --> 00:16:47.035
See, as much as we want to think of ourselves as strong

336
00:16:47.175 --> 00:16:51.115
and able and,

337
00:16:51.255 --> 00:16:53.275
and yes, even comparatively to other people,

338
00:16:53.375 --> 00:16:55.155
we might be in some ways,

339
00:16:57.565 --> 00:17:01.195
but compared to God, we are

340
00:17:02.135 --> 00:17:03.205
infinitely weak.

341
00:17:04.965 --> 00:17:09.835
We bring nothing to the table. So we're weak.

342
00:17:09.835 --> 00:17:13.695
But not only that, we're limited like we are weak

343
00:17:13.795 --> 00:17:15.535
and we are limited

344
00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:18.535
because remember, none of us can actually save anyone else.

345
00:17:21.785 --> 00:17:22.805
We can't save anyone.

346
00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:25.125
In fact, we can't even change anyone's mind.

347
00:17:27.865 --> 00:17:31.245
Now, absolutely, we can and should bring reasoned arguments.

348
00:17:31.265 --> 00:17:33.765
We should explain clearly like Paul

349
00:17:33.785 --> 00:17:35.005
did in Athens and elsewhere.

350
00:17:35.005 --> 00:17:36.605
He was good at that.

351
00:17:36.905 --> 00:17:40.365
But if God doesn't work, it doesn't work.

352
00:17:42.445 --> 00:17:44.625
If he doesn't do something to change a heart

353
00:17:44.645 --> 00:17:46.785
or a mind, it isn't gonna happen.

354
00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:51.765
No matter how good we are at arguing or explaining.

355
00:17:51.995 --> 00:17:55.845
Plus, when you think about it, if we, if we begin

356
00:17:55.845 --> 00:17:58.645
to trust in those reasoned arguments instead

357
00:17:58.645 --> 00:18:00.125
of trusting in the simple truths

358
00:18:00.125 --> 00:18:01.565
of the gospel, that's a problem.

359
00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:03.165
That's what Paul was trying to get to.

360
00:18:03.385 --> 00:18:07.245
He knew the Corinthians were, were prone towards camps.

361
00:18:07.555 --> 00:18:09.565
Like they were saying, I'm, I follow this guy.

362
00:18:09.825 --> 00:18:11.485
Here's my philosophy over here.

363
00:18:11.485 --> 00:18:13.205
This guy's really good at explaining this.

364
00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:15.565
So I follow him, or I follow this one.

365
00:18:15.955 --> 00:18:19.725
He's good at, at tying around speakers or debaters.

366
00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:22.365
And they, they knew that was true there in Corinth.

367
00:18:22.365 --> 00:18:25.965
And so he said, no, no, no. I know my limitations.

368
00:18:27.605 --> 00:18:31.645
I know this will not work. It can't be based on me.

369
00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:34.005
It can't be based on my ability to argue.

370
00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.565
Well, because I know somebody's gonna come later

371
00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:37.845
who's better at it than I am.

372
00:18:39.665 --> 00:18:42.685
And that can't be the case that you base your faith on that

373
00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:44.685
it's got to be based on,

374
00:18:46.395 --> 00:18:48.365
because that's where the true power lies.

375
00:18:52.435 --> 00:18:54.465
Again, we've gotta view ourselves accurately

376
00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:58.325
because that keeps us first from getting prideful.

377
00:18:59.685 --> 00:19:01.255
This is what I can do.

378
00:19:03.015 --> 00:19:06.475
But then it keeps us from trusting in man when we should

379
00:19:06.475 --> 00:19:07.475
trust in God alone.

380
00:19:09.385 --> 00:19:12.385
Remembering who we are keeps us there.

381
00:19:12.405 --> 00:19:13.745
But there's also this other point.

382
00:19:14.725 --> 00:19:17.585
You remember our main point quoting from two Corinthians 12.

383
00:19:17.645 --> 00:19:20.945
It says that when we are weak, then we are strong, right?

384
00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:25.915
So that's the main idea. How does that even work?

385
00:19:27.855 --> 00:19:29.635
How does, how does weakness mean?

386
00:19:29.915 --> 00:19:34.345
Strength Because the weak vessel is the vessel

387
00:19:34.375 --> 00:19:35.985
that God actually uses.

388
00:19:38.895 --> 00:19:41.635
And look back up. You're in one Corinthians chapter two,

389
00:19:41.635 --> 00:19:46.595
right before that, the end of chapter one, verse 27.

390
00:19:48.815 --> 00:19:50.115
He, he's talking about the gospel,

391
00:19:50.215 --> 00:19:52.715
but he's also talking about the messenger of the gospel.

392
00:19:54.925 --> 00:19:58.955
Verse 27 says, God chose what is foolish in the world

393
00:19:59.255 --> 00:20:00.355
to shame the wise.

394
00:20:01.095 --> 00:20:05.395
God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.

395
00:20:07.235 --> 00:20:11.565
What Paul's doing here is he's describing the ideal vehicle

396
00:20:12.035 --> 00:20:13.885
that God uses for the ministry,

397
00:20:15.135 --> 00:20:17.995
saying this is the way the gospel works compared to the way

398
00:20:17.995 --> 00:20:19.995
of the world, but it's also the way I work

399
00:20:19.995 --> 00:20:22.035
through these vessels.

400
00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:25.355
It's the same thing. He wrote this quote, I keep coming back

401
00:20:25.355 --> 00:20:26.355
to second Corinthians 12.

402
00:20:26.505 --> 00:20:29.115
He's writing there three times.

403
00:20:29.575 --> 00:20:32.315
He asked God to take away this thorn.

404
00:20:34.005 --> 00:20:36.185
He say, God, I want this gone. It hurts.

405
00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:39.225
Whatever it is, take away the thorn in my flesh.

406
00:20:42.035 --> 00:20:44.695
Here's how the back and forth goes with God. Check this out.

407
00:20:44.695 --> 00:20:46.175
Second Corinthians 12, nine and 10.

408
00:20:49.485 --> 00:20:54.135
But God said to me, my grace is sufficient

409
00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:57.915
for you, for my power is made

410
00:20:57.915 --> 00:20:59.555
perfect in weakness.

411
00:21:02.405 --> 00:21:05.985
So Paul, therefore, I will boast all the more gladly

412
00:21:06.005 --> 00:21:08.585
of my weaknesses, so that the power

413
00:21:08.845 --> 00:21:13.295
of Christ may rest upon me for the sake of Christ.

414
00:21:13.365 --> 00:21:16.815
Then I'm content with weaknesses, insults, hardships,

415
00:21:17.535 --> 00:21:21.955
persecutions, calamities for when I'm weak,

416
00:21:22.265 --> 00:21:23.635
then I am strong.

417
00:21:25.425 --> 00:21:26.935
Right? It sounds like a paradox.

418
00:21:27.045 --> 00:21:31.075
Yeah, that I'm, I,

419
00:21:31.155 --> 00:21:33.875
I can't be weak and strong.

420
00:21:33.895 --> 00:21:34.915
It doesn't work that way.

421
00:21:34.975 --> 00:21:37.435
But he says, no, when I'm weak, then I'm strong. How?

422
00:21:37.435 --> 00:21:39.755
Because when my weakness shows up,

423
00:21:39.755 --> 00:21:41.515
that's when God's power shows up.

424
00:21:43.695 --> 00:21:44.695
I mean, just think about it.

425
00:21:44.865 --> 00:21:47.375
Who's more believable when they say,

426
00:21:47.535 --> 00:21:49.175
I trust God with all that I am.

427
00:21:49.335 --> 00:21:52.935
I trust God wholeheartedly. Who's more believable?

428
00:21:53.765 --> 00:21:56.975
Someone who is a great speaker, has it all together.

429
00:21:57.125 --> 00:22:01.335
They're wealthy, they're healthy. Everything is in order.

430
00:22:01.565 --> 00:22:03.775
They're polished. It's all that way.

431
00:22:06.705 --> 00:22:08.245
Or someone who is broken

432
00:22:09.865 --> 00:22:14.685
and stutters, feeble.

433
00:22:15.815 --> 00:22:18.355
There's, there's some sickness.

434
00:22:18.625 --> 00:22:20.435
There's, there's a desperation.

435
00:22:22.745 --> 00:22:25.215
Who's more believable? Say, I trust God.

436
00:22:27.515 --> 00:22:30.375
One of those is tempted to trust in themselves.

437
00:22:31.275 --> 00:22:34.095
To trust in what they have

438
00:22:34.635 --> 00:22:36.415
or that they're a self-made man

439
00:22:36.435 --> 00:22:37.615
or a self-made woman,

440
00:22:40.005 --> 00:22:41.495
that they can sustain it all

441
00:22:41.675 --> 00:22:42.935
and they're tempted to believe

442
00:22:42.935 --> 00:22:46.845
that they don't really need God because I have all this.

443
00:22:49.775 --> 00:22:53.485
Whereas one is in a spot of life

444
00:22:53.485 --> 00:22:55.445
where they know they need him,

445
00:22:56.115 --> 00:22:58.165
that they can't survive without him,

446
00:22:58.675 --> 00:23:01.005
that they know he's worth it.

447
00:23:01.075 --> 00:23:04.585
Even in the struggle who's more believable.

448
00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:09.185
That's why God chooses the weak vessel

449
00:23:10.225 --> 00:23:11.605
rather than the strong vessel.

450
00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:19.265
Just this week, I stood with a man next to his wife.

451
00:23:19.735 --> 00:23:21.425
They've been married over 40 years.

452
00:23:22.635 --> 00:23:25.385
She's laying in a hospital bed as she neared the end

453
00:23:25.445 --> 00:23:28.665
of her life, stricken with cancer the last few years,

454
00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:35.475
and the framed pictures on the table next to her

455
00:23:36.995 --> 00:23:39.715
revealed how much her earthly tint had been wasting away

456
00:23:39.865 --> 00:23:41.075
over the last few years.

457
00:23:44.315 --> 00:23:45.935
In fact, I got a text literally

458
00:23:45.935 --> 00:23:47.775
before I walked up here that she died this morning.

459
00:23:51.725 --> 00:23:55.945
Yet through tears on Wednesday, as he watches his wife die,

460
00:23:58.375 --> 00:24:02.075
her husband shared how much this experience

461
00:24:03.055 --> 00:24:06.515
had grown, both his faith and her faith

462
00:24:08.755 --> 00:24:13.375
and how he watched her trust God

463
00:24:13.445 --> 00:24:14.455
through it all

464
00:24:16.005 --> 00:24:19.505
and suffer strongly through it all.

465
00:24:23.385 --> 00:24:27.505
See our flesh in that moment, our, our world in

466
00:24:27.505 --> 00:24:29.825
that moment looks at that and says, that's weakness.

467
00:24:30.015 --> 00:24:31.785
What she's going through, she's dying.

468
00:24:31.785 --> 00:24:33.185
That's why we push death away.

469
00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:35.425
We don't want to deal with it because it's weakness.

470
00:24:37.925 --> 00:24:42.765
Yet, when someone truly trusts the Lord in the middle

471
00:24:42.905 --> 00:24:45.045
of that, they're actually strong

472
00:24:45.465 --> 00:24:46.565
no matter what they're facing.

473
00:24:51.285 --> 00:24:54.355
Again, not because we're strong in ourselves, but

474
00:24:54.355 --> 00:24:56.395
because we remember who we truly are,

475
00:24:56.585 --> 00:24:59.315
because we remember who God truly is, right?

476
00:24:59.315 --> 00:25:01.515
That's the whole comparison thing we're talking about here.

477
00:25:02.965 --> 00:25:04.495
This is remembering who we are,

478
00:25:04.835 --> 00:25:07.855
but we've gotta also remember who God is in this process.

479
00:25:11.635 --> 00:25:13.595
I mean, we're gonna go back through this passage in one

480
00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:16.155
Corinthians two, so we've seen kind of who we are,

481
00:25:16.175 --> 00:25:18.675
who Paul viewed himself to be, who we need to see ourselves

482
00:25:18.695 --> 00:25:20.355
to be weak, limited.

483
00:25:21.415 --> 00:25:25.115
But let's read the same passage with the perspective on

484
00:25:25.115 --> 00:25:26.235
who God is this time.

485
00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:29.965
Look at this again. One Corinthians two, one through five,

486
00:25:30.165 --> 00:25:33.125
I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming

487
00:25:33.125 --> 00:25:35.925
to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom.

488
00:25:36.345 --> 00:25:39.845
For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ

489
00:25:39.865 --> 00:25:43.565
and Him crucify, and I was weak with you in weakness

490
00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:45.685
and fear and much trembling my speech,

491
00:25:45.745 --> 00:25:48.005
my message were not implausible, words of wisdom,

492
00:25:49.505 --> 00:25:53.605
but in demonstration of the spirit of God

493
00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:56.245
and of power, so

494
00:25:56.245 --> 00:25:59.165
that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men,

495
00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:01.165
but in the power of God.

496
00:26:04.445 --> 00:26:08.655
Notice how he saw God. What was his perspective on God?

497
00:26:09.075 --> 00:26:10.935
He said, first, man, God is powerful.

498
00:26:13.445 --> 00:26:14.505
God is powerful.

499
00:26:15.625 --> 00:26:18.775
We're weak, but God is

500
00:26:19.415 --> 00:26:21.535
powerful Twice in just two verses,

501
00:26:21.535 --> 00:26:22.615
that word shows up, right?

502
00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:25.015
Verse four and verse five, the power of God,

503
00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:26.695
that God is powerful

504
00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:30.135
and that he gives power to us as we live.

505
00:26:31.255 --> 00:26:33.275
I know I keep going back to it,

506
00:26:33.275 --> 00:26:35.195
but listen to second Corinthians 12, nine.

507
00:26:35.195 --> 00:26:39.545
Again, God said to Paul,

508
00:26:40.045 --> 00:26:42.225
my grace is sufficient for you,

509
00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:46.205
for my power is made perfect in weakness.

510
00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:51.045
It's completed. It's shown to be what it is.

511
00:26:51.545 --> 00:26:56.215
In your weakness, Paul, in your weakness, believer

512
00:26:57.525 --> 00:27:01.835
God's power is completed, shown up

513
00:27:02.745 --> 00:27:03.955
through our weakness,

514
00:27:09.235 --> 00:27:11.775
his powers revealed through weak vessels like you and me.

515
00:27:14.825 --> 00:27:17.995
This is what Isaiah said. Same kind of context.

516
00:27:19.935 --> 00:27:23.355
Isaiah 40 verses 28 through 31. Have you not known?

517
00:27:23.355 --> 00:27:25.155
Have you not heard the Lord?

518
00:27:25.455 --> 00:27:27.995
Yahweh is the everlasting God,

519
00:27:29.495 --> 00:27:31.155
the creator of the ends of the earth.

520
00:27:31.575 --> 00:27:34.275
He does not faint or grow weary.

521
00:27:34.615 --> 00:27:36.435
His understanding is unsearchable.

522
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:40.355
He gives power to the faint and to him who has no might.

523
00:27:40.415 --> 00:27:41.795
He increases strength.

524
00:27:42.145 --> 00:27:44.955
Even youth us shall faint and be weary.

525
00:27:45.165 --> 00:27:47.035
Young men shall fall exhausted,

526
00:27:47.335 --> 00:27:50.795
but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength.

527
00:27:50.985 --> 00:27:53.075
They shall mount up with wings like eagles.

528
00:27:53.145 --> 00:27:55.075
They shall run and not be weary.

529
00:27:55.145 --> 00:27:59.115
They shall walk and not faint. That's not you strong.

530
00:27:59.215 --> 00:28:01.555
That's God's power flowing through you strong.

531
00:28:04.885 --> 00:28:07.545
Remember who we are. We're weak, we're limited,

532
00:28:08.485 --> 00:28:11.185
but remember who God is, right?

533
00:28:13.985 --> 00:28:18.395
He's strong, he's powerful. We are weak in and of ourselves.

534
00:28:18.935 --> 00:28:21.355
But listen, that is completely fine

535
00:28:21.355 --> 00:28:23.275
because the more we acknowledge that,

536
00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.955
the more God's power is clearly seen through us.

537
00:28:28.705 --> 00:28:30.655
God's gonna do his work however he wants to,

538
00:28:30.655 --> 00:28:32.015
however he chooses to.

539
00:28:32.235 --> 00:28:36.415
But the most glory he receives is when he uses weak, feeble,

540
00:28:36.525 --> 00:28:38.135
limited people like you and me.

541
00:28:39.935 --> 00:28:42.055
I mean, he could Red Sea split this thing

542
00:28:42.055 --> 00:28:44.495
and he could show off and do big things by himself.

543
00:28:45.055 --> 00:28:48.975
Absolutely. But the more glory he gets is through us,

544
00:28:50.295 --> 00:28:54.845
that he uses us as weak as we are.

545
00:28:55.345 --> 00:28:56.365
But why does he do that?

546
00:28:58.315 --> 00:28:59.775
One Corinthians one says, so

547
00:28:59.775 --> 00:29:03.095
that no human being might boast in the presence of God.

548
00:29:04.855 --> 00:29:08.915
Why does he choose to use limited, foolish people like us so

549
00:29:08.915 --> 00:29:10.915
that we wouldn't boast, that we have nothing

550
00:29:11.055 --> 00:29:12.475
to stand on ourselves?

551
00:29:14.135 --> 00:29:16.495
'cause when we remember who we are truly in flight of

552
00:29:16.495 --> 00:29:17.495
who God is truly,

553
00:29:18.245 --> 00:29:20.335
that should make us the most humble

554
00:29:20.335 --> 00:29:21.615
people in the face of the earth.

555
00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:26.455
Here's what we do instead,

556
00:29:28.185 --> 00:29:29.705
I know I do this, you do this.

557
00:29:29.805 --> 00:29:31.385
We, we might even do it really quietly.

558
00:29:31.385 --> 00:29:32.625
We don't do it publicly,

559
00:29:33.885 --> 00:29:35.305
but we start a comparison game

560
00:29:35.305 --> 00:29:36.745
between us and other people, don't we?

561
00:29:39.075 --> 00:29:42.125
Body type wealth status,

562
00:29:42.995 --> 00:29:45.165
theological knowledge, intelligence,

563
00:29:46.465 --> 00:29:47.645
and we look around at people

564
00:29:47.665 --> 00:29:49.845
and we say, I'm better than they are at that,

565
00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:52.755
and we start to feel pretty good about ourselves.

566
00:29:56.465 --> 00:29:57.555
Problem though. Yeah.

567
00:29:57.825 --> 00:30:00.435
When we get out of the way, the

568
00:30:01.695 --> 00:30:05.705
more we would acknowledge that we're not trying

569
00:30:05.705 --> 00:30:07.225
to compare it to anybody else but God,

570
00:30:07.755 --> 00:30:11.385
which means we then acknowledge our dependence on the Lord

571
00:30:11.725 --> 00:30:14.105
in that, the more then he shows up

572
00:30:14.105 --> 00:30:17.065
through our lives, we start comparing.

573
00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:19.345
We start to play this game in the world,

574
00:30:19.565 --> 00:30:23.495
and we start to see what we get from that.

575
00:30:24.465 --> 00:30:27.485
The results we get from that, that anything we try

576
00:30:27.485 --> 00:30:29.245
to do on our own will fail

577
00:30:30.445 --> 00:30:32.345
or will not produce the fruit God

578
00:30:32.355 --> 00:30:33.705
wants to produce through our lives.

579
00:30:33.805 --> 00:30:35.585
We start to do it on our own. We start to compare.

580
00:30:35.585 --> 00:30:38.665
We start to try to to buck up and try harder,

581
00:30:38.685 --> 00:30:40.065
and we make it happen ourselves.

582
00:30:40.375 --> 00:30:44.305
What we get the results of that,

583
00:30:48.055 --> 00:30:49.235
by the way, this is including

584
00:30:50.005 --> 00:30:52.475
where we think we can argue someone into salvation,

585
00:30:55.375 --> 00:30:58.275
or we come up with slick marketing ways to try

586
00:30:58.275 --> 00:31:00.235
to manipulate emotions, to get people

587
00:31:00.295 --> 00:31:03.555
to come forward on a Sunday and say some prayer,

588
00:31:06.015 --> 00:31:08.275
and they feel no conviction, but they've done something

589
00:31:08.275 --> 00:31:09.275
because they think they should.

590
00:31:12.225 --> 00:31:16.145
This is, this is our own strength. But what did Paul say?

591
00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:18.705
I didn't use the means the world uses.

592
00:31:20.435 --> 00:31:24.155
I simply resolved to proclaim to you the gospel of Christ

593
00:31:24.255 --> 00:31:25.315
and him crucified.

594
00:31:25.375 --> 00:31:29.395
That's all he did. He comes

595
00:31:29.495 --> 00:31:30.835
to Corinth, he says, I'm weak.

596
00:31:31.445 --> 00:31:33.835
Don't put your trust in me. Don't hope in me.

597
00:31:33.965 --> 00:31:35.715
Don't think I'm some reasoned

598
00:31:35.715 --> 00:31:37.595
philosophical argument that you can stand on.

599
00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:41.955
That's not my job, my job, what he says in Romans

600
00:31:43.115 --> 00:31:45.615
one 16, he says, my job simply,

601
00:31:49.115 --> 00:31:53.455
I'm not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God

602
00:31:53.555 --> 00:31:56.255
for salvation to everyone who believes, both

603
00:31:56.255 --> 00:31:57.575
to the Jew and also to the Greek.

604
00:32:00.465 --> 00:32:02.165
He says, the gospel, the good news

605
00:32:02.225 --> 00:32:04.685
of Christ is the power of God.

606
00:32:04.685 --> 00:32:07.885
And so hear me today, place your faith not in me,

607
00:32:08.265 --> 00:32:10.885
not in a system, not in a reasoned argument.

608
00:32:10.885 --> 00:32:15.045
Place your faith in the power of God because he is powerful,

609
00:32:15.105 --> 00:32:17.205
but also because he's unlimited.

610
00:32:18.665 --> 00:32:21.005
You're weak, you're limited. I'm weak, I'm limited.

611
00:32:21.385 --> 00:32:23.525
God is powerful, and God is unlimited.

612
00:32:27.965 --> 00:32:30.905
The means of this world, you

613
00:32:30.905 --> 00:32:33.205
and I, we are limited,

614
00:32:35.075 --> 00:32:38.295
but God is unlimited.

615
00:32:38.475 --> 00:32:40.765
And think about that again in the context of our passage,

616
00:32:40.905 --> 00:32:42.885
one Corinthians two, look at verse five again.

617
00:32:45.295 --> 00:32:48.315
It says, so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom

618
00:32:48.415 --> 00:32:51.275
of men, the ways of the world, the systems that we have.

619
00:32:51.655 --> 00:32:53.315
So your faith might not rest in that,

620
00:32:53.695 --> 00:32:56.315
but in the power of God.

621
00:32:57.585 --> 00:32:59.405
So he says, faith here, what kind

622
00:32:59.445 --> 00:33:00.485
of faith is he talking about?

623
00:33:00.635 --> 00:33:02.605
He's clearly talking about saving faith, right?

624
00:33:04.295 --> 00:33:05.785
He's talking about our eternity.

625
00:33:08.335 --> 00:33:09.835
No human wisdom can do that.

626
00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:13.955
No reason argument can give us salvation eternally.

627
00:33:14.655 --> 00:33:19.125
We can't get there, but only the power of God

628
00:33:19.195 --> 00:33:20.445
through the life, death,

629
00:33:20.645 --> 00:33:22.885
and resurrection of Jesus in our place.

630
00:33:24.315 --> 00:33:26.535
That's the key that unlocks everything else.

631
00:33:28.325 --> 00:33:30.665
And so he says Christ and him crucified.

632
00:33:30.765 --> 00:33:32.465
That's what I am proclaiming.

633
00:33:34.615 --> 00:33:35.955
But let's just stop for a second.

634
00:33:37.885 --> 00:33:39.595
Let's, let's reflect on that for a moment

635
00:33:40.295 --> 00:33:44.835
and peel back another layer of this idea

636
00:33:44.835 --> 00:33:45.875
that he's talking about here.

637
00:33:45.905 --> 00:33:48.755
Your faith resting in the power of God.

638
00:33:51.815 --> 00:33:55.915
So think about this. If God is faithful

639
00:33:57.675 --> 00:33:59.975
to take care of your eternal life,

640
00:34:03.475 --> 00:34:05.735
If, if he is that unlimited,

641
00:34:06.925 --> 00:34:11.725
that our eternity is completely taken care

642
00:34:11.725 --> 00:34:16.365
of by God, so we don't have to fear death, we don't have

643
00:34:16.365 --> 00:34:18.765
to fear anything frightening that can happen to us.

644
00:34:18.825 --> 00:34:19.845
Now, we don't have to fear in that

645
00:34:20.085 --> 00:34:22.485
'cause God's unlimited, he's taking care of our eternity.

646
00:34:22.485 --> 00:34:26.725
If God is faithful to take care of our eternal life,

647
00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:32.635
then don't you think he can take care of our daily life too?

648
00:34:38.145 --> 00:34:41.515
Like why would we limit God to only after we die?

649
00:34:43.365 --> 00:34:44.915
Which you often hear that right?

650
00:34:45.675 --> 00:34:49.135
Salvation, I get to go to heaven, great,

651
00:34:50.805 --> 00:34:54.625
but why would we live as if he's in charge of eternity,

652
00:34:56.225 --> 00:34:57.605
but we get to be in charge today

653
00:34:59.455 --> 00:35:00.985
that he's got that taken care of.

654
00:35:01.405 --> 00:35:05.225
But it only happens when I die or when he comes back. Why?

655
00:35:05.285 --> 00:35:07.265
Why would we? It doesn't make any sense, right?

656
00:35:08.865 --> 00:35:09.925
But we do it every day.

657
00:35:11.835 --> 00:35:12.885
What Paul's talking about

658
00:35:12.905 --> 00:35:15.325
of resting in man's wisdom does not just have to do

659
00:35:15.325 --> 00:35:19.665
with eternity and reasoned arguments about his salvation

660
00:35:19.725 --> 00:35:21.145
and, and who's the savior.

661
00:35:21.455 --> 00:35:22.465
It's not just about that.

662
00:35:22.575 --> 00:35:24.745
It's about even our daily lives

663
00:35:27.015 --> 00:35:31.065
that we're still prone to daily trust

664
00:35:31.645 --> 00:35:35.035
in the ways of the world, in man's wisdom,

665
00:35:37.395 --> 00:35:38.435
in our own strength.

666
00:35:42.135 --> 00:35:45.025
Okay? So how do we know? Like

667
00:35:45.025 --> 00:35:46.225
how do we know when we're doing that?

668
00:35:46.255 --> 00:35:49.345
Because we don't want to, I, I think we all would agree,

669
00:35:49.345 --> 00:35:51.265
like we don't wanna trust in our own selves

670
00:35:51.285 --> 00:35:52.705
and our own strength and man's wisdom.

671
00:35:52.705 --> 00:35:54.705
We don't want any of that. How do we know we are?

672
00:35:57.495 --> 00:36:01.715
Listen, when I don't pray, I'm trusting myself.

673
00:36:05.965 --> 00:36:10.475
When, when I rarely confess

674
00:36:10.775 --> 00:36:14.985
sin in a genuine way, then I,

675
00:36:15.145 --> 00:36:17.185
I think I don't really need to confess sin

676
00:36:21.735 --> 00:36:24.595
if I rarely live below my means,

677
00:36:25.095 --> 00:36:27.075
so I can give sacrificially.

678
00:36:28.545 --> 00:36:31.665
I never face a moment where I have to actually trust God

679
00:36:32.465 --> 00:36:37.445
to come through for me, and we could

680
00:36:37.445 --> 00:36:38.605
go on and on, right?

681
00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:42.665
But when we think we are powerful,

682
00:36:44.595 --> 00:36:46.645
when we think we are unlimited,

683
00:36:49.705 --> 00:36:50.965
we forget who we actually

684
00:36:50.965 --> 00:36:55.105
are and what happens.

685
00:36:56.045 --> 00:37:00.425
We get weak results. Our lives are limited

686
00:37:01.005 --> 00:37:04.145
by our own feeble, feudal capacity,

687
00:37:07.085 --> 00:37:09.065
and we get what we have right now.

688
00:37:09.505 --> 00:37:14.005
Probably that's why at church,

689
00:37:14.005 --> 00:37:17.715
when we look at our lives, when we look at our families,

690
00:37:18.415 --> 00:37:22.515
we look at our church, we've got to remember who we are,

691
00:37:23.125 --> 00:37:24.835
especially in light of who he is.

692
00:37:27.785 --> 00:37:31.285
Two Corinthians four says that we have this treasure

693
00:37:31.345 --> 00:37:33.525
of the gospel in jars of clay.

694
00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:37.365
And what he means by that is the gospel is the the treasure.

695
00:37:37.575 --> 00:37:39.085
We're just a bunch of clay pots.

696
00:37:40.265 --> 00:37:43.765
We have this treasure in jars of clay to show

697
00:37:44.115 --> 00:37:47.885
that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.

698
00:37:49.555 --> 00:37:52.885
It's not about the container. It's not about you and me.

699
00:37:53.635 --> 00:37:57.205
It's about the treasure who God has shown it to be.

700
00:37:58.795 --> 00:38:03.725
It's the gospel. That's why when we

701
00:38:03.725 --> 00:38:06.865
are weak, he is powerful.

702
00:38:08.525 --> 00:38:09.535
When we are limited,

703
00:38:11.535 --> 00:38:13.555
he is unlimited.

704
00:38:13.655 --> 00:38:17.115
That's why we've got to get to the place where we say,

705
00:38:18.265 --> 00:38:21.915
when we are weak, not, not if we're weak, when we are weak,

706
00:38:22.505 --> 00:38:24.835
when we acknowledge our weakness

707
00:38:24.895 --> 00:38:27.795
before the Lord, that's when we're strong,

708
00:38:29.075 --> 00:38:31.565
because that is when the power

709
00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:33.605
of God begins to flow through us.

710
00:38:36.335 --> 00:38:37.715
So let's be weak, church.

711
00:38:40.075 --> 00:38:41.385
Let's be weak together.
