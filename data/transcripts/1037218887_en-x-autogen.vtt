00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:03.725
The one who is the true light, who gives light

2
00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:05.805
to everyone was coming into the world.

3
00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:27.785
He was in the world and the world was made through him.

4
00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:29.745
But who was this light?

5
00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:37.505
He was and is God with us?

6
00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:43.335
God with us.

7
00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:47.225
Have you ever just stopped to think about

8
00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:48.385
that phrase for a second?

9
00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:54.325
Like that phrase comes from the word in the Bible, Emmanuel,

10
00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:56.645
which you can spell with an E or an I.

11
00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.605
It's various ways, but that that's what it means.

12
00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.605
It means God with us.

13
00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:06.725
It's a theological reality that we celebrate, especially

14
00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:07.885
around Christmas time.

15
00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:11.475
But But have you really thought about it?

16
00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:12.475
Like have you really stopped

17
00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:16.595
and dwelled on that reality, thought deeply about

18
00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:22.065
God, the God of Gods, the Lord of the universe

19
00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:29.215
with like among next to rubbing shoulders, with right

20
00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:31.895
with us,

21
00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:35.625
sinful humans like you

22
00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:39.725
and me, God with

23
00:01:40.585 --> 00:01:45.175
us, what we're gonna look at over the next couple

24
00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.815
Sundays is that phrase deeply.

25
00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:52.575
We're gonna dive into what that really means, God with us.

26
00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:55.785
And so take your copy of God's word, turn with me

27
00:01:55.785 --> 00:02:00.585
to the gospel of John in the New Testament.

28
00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:02.665
You'll find the gospels, Matthew, mark, Luke,

29
00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:04.745
and then John about three fourths of the way through.

30
00:02:04.765 --> 00:02:06.665
If you're unfamiliar with the Bible, that's fine.

31
00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:08.905
Just open it up, find it that way.

32
00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:12.425
Gospel of John over the next three weeks, like I said,

33
00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:15.705
we're gonna walk verse by verse through the first 18 verses

34
00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:18.145
of John chapter one.

35
00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.905
And we're gonna see profound truths about who God is,

36
00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:24.745
but also how that then relates to our lives.

37
00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:27.345
What that means for us as we live daily.

38
00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:32.395
And these first five verses will be more than enough

39
00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:37.235
for us today as we look at how God with us brings

40
00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:41.315
life in more ways than one.

41
00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:43.915
Look at John one, one through five.

42
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:51.785
In the beginning was the word and the word was with God.

43
00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:56.505
And the word was God. He was in the beginning with God.

44
00:02:58.085 --> 00:02:59.765
All things were made through him.

45
00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:04.125
Without Him was not anything made that was made

46
00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.125
in him was life.

47
00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:10.485
And the life was the light of men.

48
00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:13.445
The light shines in the darkness

49
00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:16.285
and the darkness has not overcome it.

50
00:03:18.195 --> 00:03:19.215
God, this is your word

51
00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:22.775
and we need you to open our eyes to see

52
00:03:22.795 --> 00:03:25.975
and understand what it means and what it means for us.

53
00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:29.095
Holy Spirit, teach us today.

54
00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:32.775
May it be your words, not mine.

55
00:03:34.835 --> 00:03:36.615
And we can do nothing apart from you, Jesus.

56
00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.055
And so we ask you to bear good fruit

57
00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:40.455
through this for your glory.

58
00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:42.775
In Jesus' name. Amen.

59
00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:46.725
So you can see in those five

60
00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.005
verses, there's a whole lot there, right?

61
00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:50.845
Like we could spend weeks on just the first verse,

62
00:03:53.075 --> 00:03:55.175
but before we dig into it, we need to know why John

63
00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:59.455
the apostle disciple of Jesus, why did he even write this?

64
00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:02.015
What was going on that precipitated him

65
00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:04.255
to write down these few verses?

66
00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:06.135
Well, what we know was at the time,

67
00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:11.015
he was addressing a common heresy or a falsehood about God.

68
00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:16.775
Sadly, one that has persisted even for the last 2000 years.

69
00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.705
'cause what they were, what they were saying at the time,

70
00:04:20.705 --> 00:04:22.985
people were saying at the time that that Jesus

71
00:04:23.605 --> 00:04:25.945
was a good person, but he was not the son of God.

72
00:04:27.885 --> 00:04:30.145
Or they were saying that Jesus was unusual, yes,

73
00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.225
but he wasn't divine.

74
00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:35.825
That he had clearly a measure of the spirit

75
00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:37.265
of God resting on him,

76
00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:40.545
but he was just a human like you and me.

77
00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:45.025
Again, that's not just back then.

78
00:04:45.045 --> 00:04:47.985
You might have heard those very things this week.

79
00:04:50.445 --> 00:04:52.895
Anytime someone says that Jesus was merely a good teacher,

80
00:04:54.325 --> 00:04:57.865
or anytime someone says that he sinned as a human,

81
00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:00.625
which sadly a large percentage of people

82
00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:02.945
who call themselves Christians believe Jesus sinned.

83
00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:06.455
Right? Anytime you hear those kinds of things,

84
00:05:06.455 --> 00:05:07.855
that's the same idea

85
00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:10.335
that John was addressing 2000 years ago.

86
00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:14.775
That's why he started the way he did in verse one.

87
00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:18.295
What were the critical first words that he started with?

88
00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:22.615
He says in the beginning, right?

89
00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:25.695
That's the first three words of verse one in the beginning.

90
00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:34.435
John didn't start with the birth of Jesus like Luke does,

91
00:05:35.505 --> 00:05:37.065
Like Matthew does.

92
00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:41.535
John didn't uh, start with the baptism

93
00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:43.215
of Jesus like Mark did.

94
00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:49.395
No, John started with the initiation of time itself.

95
00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:53.975
He goes way back in the beginning.

96
00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:57.005
Now that

97
00:05:57.085 --> 00:05:59.725
that phrase might ring a bell in our minds, right?

98
00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:02.485
Kids, you've heard that before. Somewhere.

99
00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:05.845
It sounds like the start of another book

100
00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:09.885
of the Bible might be familiar with namely Genesis,

101
00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:14.345
the first book of the Bible, the creation account.

102
00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:17.365
Here's how it starts.

103
00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:22.435
Verse one in the beginning, God created.

104
00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:25.065
Now, let's even shorten that for a second.

105
00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:29.725
In the beginning, God, what that means

106
00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:33.725
is that God was already there when time

107
00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:35.165
as we know it started.

108
00:06:37.395 --> 00:06:38.455
He had no beginning

109
00:06:38.775 --> 00:06:40.135
'cause he was there in the beginning, right?

110
00:06:40.135 --> 00:06:44.855
You understand that John one says the same thing about

111
00:06:45.115 --> 00:06:48.675
the word in the beginning

112
00:06:49.455 --> 00:06:51.315
was the word, verse two.

113
00:06:51.855 --> 00:06:55.475
He was in the beginning, right? So he already existed.

114
00:06:55.585 --> 00:06:58.155
Okay, so then who is this word? That's the next question.

115
00:06:58.175 --> 00:07:00.515
We need to know who that word actually is.

116
00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:03.395
It's capitalized in your Bible, right?

117
00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:06.875
Clearly something unique going on here, but who is it?

118
00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:12.325
Well, we already know from this passage, the word is God,

119
00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:15.925
but we have to tie it with the rest of the chapter

120
00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:17.205
to understand who it is, right?

121
00:07:17.205 --> 00:07:20.125
To fully understand what this is happening, what's

122
00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:21.485
who this word is.

123
00:07:21.485 --> 00:07:22.845
So I'm gonna jump ahead just a second.

124
00:07:22.845 --> 00:07:23.845
We'll get there in a couple weeks,

125
00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:27.605
but look down at verse 14 here in chapter one,

126
00:07:29.915 --> 00:07:31.645
look at verse 14, see what it says.

127
00:07:33.775 --> 00:07:37.675
And the word became flesh and dwelled among us.

128
00:07:38.215 --> 00:07:39.955
And we have seen His glory.

129
00:07:40.365 --> 00:07:44.675
Glory as of the only son from the Father full

130
00:07:44.675 --> 00:07:46.235
of grace and truth.

131
00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:51.085
So with verse one, we know the word is God,

132
00:07:51.385 --> 00:07:55.845
yet this word took on flesh and dwelt among us.

133
00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:02.755
Plus John writes, this act shows the words glory,

134
00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:08.715
which is the same glory as of the only son from the Father.

135
00:08:08.935 --> 00:08:10.715
So you follow the logic here, right?

136
00:08:10.855 --> 00:08:15.035
The word shows the glory of the Son from the Father.

137
00:08:15.135 --> 00:08:19.195
So John is teaching us here the word in verse one is the

138
00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:23.065
God, the Son, the son of God.

139
00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:24.985
That's who it is.

140
00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:29.345
The second person of the trinity who took on flesh,

141
00:08:29.595 --> 00:08:31.905
which then we now know as Jesus.

142
00:08:34.965 --> 00:08:36.505
Now I know this is hard to understand.

143
00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:38.625
We're going back to what we did in January with the Trinity

144
00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:40.225
and the incarnation, all this stuff, yes,

145
00:08:40.455 --> 00:08:41.905
it's hard to understand.

146
00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:44.665
But what that should do, anytime you run into something

147
00:08:44.665 --> 00:08:46.785
that's hard to understand about God,

148
00:08:46.935 --> 00:08:50.425
what it should do is it should increase our awe

149
00:08:50.645 --> 00:08:55.625
and wonder at this Emmanuel idea, God with us,

150
00:08:56.925 --> 00:09:00.865
he came, God, this God came to be with us.

151
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:05.495
Wow. So

152
00:09:05.495 --> 00:09:06.535
what do we learn about this?

153
00:09:06.915 --> 00:09:09.935
God, just from these first few verses,

154
00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:13.435
well first we've already talked about this.

155
00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:16.635
We learn that God the Son is eternal.

156
00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:23.025
The word God the Son, right? Interchangeable, he's eternal.

157
00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:31.045
Remember he was in the beginning, he was already there.

158
00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:34.525
He was not created at any point. He pre-existed.

159
00:09:34.705 --> 00:09:36.525
He existed from before time began.

160
00:09:36.635 --> 00:09:38.405
It's the same phrase as Genesis one.

161
00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:43.075
In the beginning, God, in the beginning was the word

162
00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:46.175
again, this is stunning

163
00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:49.895
because this God who exists outside of time,

164
00:09:50.435 --> 00:09:54.455
he entered into time to be with us, to be Emmanuel.

165
00:09:56.725 --> 00:09:59.365
'cause he, he was, he was there before time began.

166
00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:02.285
Like that's hard to understand. But that means the God

167
00:10:02.525 --> 00:10:07.045
who is outside of time chose a date to be born.

168
00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:14.975
I love how HB Charles said it. Many babies have become king.

169
00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:18.335
Only once has a king become a baby.

170
00:10:22.295 --> 00:10:24.435
He is eternal. But there's something

171
00:10:24.635 --> 00:10:25.715
even more profound here.

172
00:10:26.015 --> 00:10:29.315
The second phrase of verse one, this word God the Son,

173
00:10:29.775 --> 00:10:32.235
he is not God the Father.

174
00:10:34.465 --> 00:10:35.955
What are we learning from John? One?

175
00:10:35.965 --> 00:10:39.115
We're seeing God is eternal God, the Son is eternal God.

176
00:10:39.115 --> 00:10:41.515
The Son is also not God the Father

177
00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:45.355
because what does it say the word was with God?

178
00:10:48.325 --> 00:10:51.545
Now that phrase could

179
00:10:51.605 --> 00:10:54.745
and has led some people to say, well there's

180
00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:59.715
that means there's more than one God in,

181
00:10:59.735 --> 00:11:03.635
in fact, there are some so-called Christian heresies

182
00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:05.035
that say that very thing.

183
00:11:09.215 --> 00:11:11.825
Even offering up the fact that you could be one

184
00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:14.435
of those gods, which by the way,

185
00:11:14.435 --> 00:11:15.675
that's a great growth strategy.

186
00:11:15.745 --> 00:11:17.155
Like who wouldn't want that, right?

187
00:11:17.545 --> 00:11:19.995
Yeah, I wanna rule my own world. Of course you would.

188
00:11:22.645 --> 00:11:24.225
But what is this verse actually saying?

189
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.025
Is it if it's not saying there's more than one God?

190
00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:29.025
'cause we know God is one. How is this actually saying

191
00:11:29.025 --> 00:11:30.505
something that makes sense?

192
00:11:30.505 --> 00:11:34.465
Well, John was referencing what we now know as the Trinity,

193
00:11:35.325 --> 00:11:40.055
that God is three in one, one in three, the Trinity.

194
00:11:40.235 --> 00:11:43.455
Now this is one of the most difficult concepts in all

195
00:11:43.455 --> 00:11:46.535
of Christianity to at least grasp a little bit.

196
00:11:46.535 --> 00:11:47.535
We won't fully understand it,

197
00:11:47.555 --> 00:11:51.695
but there's three persons, one, God, father,

198
00:11:51.835 --> 00:11:52.855
son, holy Spirit.

199
00:11:53.315 --> 00:11:54.405
They're not the same,

200
00:11:55.185 --> 00:11:58.575
but they're all God, three persons.

201
00:11:58.755 --> 00:12:02.015
One essence, one being that again, it's difficult

202
00:12:02.115 --> 00:12:04.935
to understand now, we'll we'll get to their oneness

203
00:12:05.075 --> 00:12:06.855
and equality in a second,

204
00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:09.535
but this phrase here, the word was with

205
00:12:10.075 --> 00:12:12.615
God is emphasizing the distinction

206
00:12:12.615 --> 00:12:14.215
between the son and the father.

207
00:12:15.415 --> 00:12:18.665
That there's not the same there. There's a distinctness.

208
00:12:18.665 --> 00:12:22.705
That word with that implies closeness, implies intimacy.

209
00:12:22.705 --> 00:12:24.585
Like you're facing each other.

210
00:12:25.085 --> 00:12:26.625
The persons then of the Father

211
00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:31.105
and the Son are distinguishable but are not separable.

212
00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:36.055
They're distinguishable, but they're inseparable.

213
00:12:38.715 --> 00:12:40.735
And this is not something we're making up, okay?

214
00:12:40.745 --> 00:12:41.815
We're not looking back

215
00:12:41.815 --> 00:12:43.415
theologically trying to create something.

216
00:12:43.415 --> 00:12:48.335
Jesus said this John 17, verse five, as he's praying Now,

217
00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:53.615
father glorify me in your own presence with the glory

218
00:12:53.845 --> 00:12:56.535
that I had with you before the world existed.

219
00:12:58.335 --> 00:13:01.195
So Jesus himself is saying, distinct Father,

220
00:13:01.455 --> 00:13:02.835
but I had glory with you.

221
00:13:03.145 --> 00:13:06.715
That with idea, same kind of thing, inseparable ness.

222
00:13:09.585 --> 00:13:12.245
So the Son is not the Father

223
00:13:13.135 --> 00:13:16.325
since the word was forever with God, meaning

224
00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:17.445
with the Father.

225
00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:21.675
Yet at the same time,

226
00:13:23.815 --> 00:13:28.235
the very next phrase in verse one of John one says this

227
00:13:28.615 --> 00:13:30.875
and the word was God.

228
00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:36.115
Okay? So the son is not the Father, which

229
00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:38.165
we kind of get that right.

230
00:13:38.165 --> 00:13:40.245
We gotta handle that carefully theologically, but,

231
00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:41.485
but we kind of get that right.

232
00:13:41.485 --> 00:13:45.325
The son's not the father, but the son is God just as much

233
00:13:45.345 --> 00:13:46.485
as the Father is God.

234
00:13:49.655 --> 00:13:54.155
The way theologians say it is that God, the Son, is co-equal

235
00:13:54.265 --> 00:13:55.755
with God, the Father

236
00:13:57.135 --> 00:14:01.545
and God, the Spirit, the Son is

237
00:14:01.745 --> 00:14:03.545
co-equal with the Father.

238
00:14:05.415 --> 00:14:07.075
So distinct persons,

239
00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:11.025
but one being right?

240
00:14:11.025 --> 00:14:13.665
Like I get we under, we can't understand that.

241
00:14:13.855 --> 00:14:17.425
It's mind blowing to think about how this works.

242
00:14:17.485 --> 00:14:20.185
And it's really hard for our limited minds

243
00:14:20.185 --> 00:14:23.985
to understand an unlimited God for our finite minds

244
00:14:23.985 --> 00:14:26.025
to understand an infinite God.

245
00:14:26.085 --> 00:14:28.385
It is nearly impossible.

246
00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:30.065
Which by the way isn't a bad thing

247
00:14:30.065 --> 00:14:32.425
because then he can be God and we don't have to be.

248
00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:37.065
And it spars, wor, it spurs worship, right?

249
00:14:37.165 --> 00:14:38.225
It sparks it in us.

250
00:14:38.365 --> 00:14:40.465
But it's so hard to understand

251
00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:44.825
that some people have drifted into heresy, into falsehood

252
00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:46.345
as they try to explain it.

253
00:14:49.445 --> 00:14:51.565
Some people say that God takes on different

254
00:14:51.575 --> 00:14:52.645
forms like water.

255
00:14:53.535 --> 00:14:56.955
You go back to physical science and middle school, right?

256
00:14:58.555 --> 00:15:02.415
You got ice and steam and water, right?

257
00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:03.935
So you taking different forms.

258
00:15:04.035 --> 00:15:07.095
The problem is that that's called modalism, which denies

259
00:15:07.095 --> 00:15:09.535
that God is actually three distinct persons,

260
00:15:09.595 --> 00:15:13.885
but one being just takes different forms

261
00:15:14.145 --> 00:15:15.205
as he needs to.

262
00:15:15.465 --> 00:15:19.285
That's false. Or some say that the father, son,

263
00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:21.245
and spirit are each a part of God,

264
00:15:21.435 --> 00:15:22.965
like each of them are a third.

265
00:15:23.225 --> 00:15:25.525
You put them together and it makes up the whole.

266
00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:26.805
That's again, heresy.

267
00:15:26.805 --> 00:15:28.885
It's a falsehood called partialism

268
00:15:30.355 --> 00:15:32.405
that the son is only part God.

269
00:15:36.285 --> 00:15:40.135
Mormons even mistranslate verse one by saying

270
00:15:40.135 --> 00:15:42.055
that the word was a God.

271
00:15:44.315 --> 00:15:46.595
'cause when you go back to the Greek language, that word

272
00:15:46.615 --> 00:15:49.755
for God doesn't have a definite Article V in front of it.

273
00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:53.435
So what they're saying is that this word was divine, yes,

274
00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:58.525
but was not God almighty, that this, this,

275
00:15:58.945 --> 00:16:01.725
the word was created in the beginning

276
00:16:01.825 --> 00:16:06.005
of our world's time in order to rule over this world

277
00:16:08.215 --> 00:16:09.355
one of many worlds.

278
00:16:11.935 --> 00:16:14.325
Again, though the problem is that the actual text

279
00:16:14.325 --> 00:16:16.205
of scripture can't mean any of that

280
00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:22.075
because the whole verse in verse one is all about God

281
00:16:22.275 --> 00:16:25.285
Almighty, even about this word, it's tying it together.

282
00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:28.525
It's all about him. The very phrase itself uses a linking

283
00:16:28.555 --> 00:16:31.405
word that equates both sides.

284
00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:34.245
The word was God, that was equates the two.

285
00:16:36.785 --> 00:16:39.755
There's all over the New Testament cases where yes,

286
00:16:39.815 --> 00:16:41.115
it doesn't have a definite article,

287
00:16:41.135 --> 00:16:43.715
but we don't have to put a in front of it in those cases.

288
00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:45.835
So you see, it doesn't even make sense.

289
00:16:45.975 --> 00:16:47.755
You're trying to make an argument for something

290
00:16:47.755 --> 00:16:50.595
that cannot stand in the text.

291
00:16:52.495 --> 00:16:53.555
And so we can toss that.

292
00:16:56.505 --> 00:16:58.365
But in the end, what do we boil it down to?

293
00:16:58.465 --> 00:17:01.965
In the end, what we learn from this is that God, the Son

294
00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:06.035
is God almighty God,

295
00:17:06.035 --> 00:17:09.955
the Son is the word is God almighty, co-equal

296
00:17:10.225 --> 00:17:14.875
with the Father three in one, not confusing the persons

297
00:17:15.335 --> 00:17:16.555
nor dividing the essence.

298
00:17:18.355 --> 00:17:19.375
That's the truth.

299
00:17:20.435 --> 00:17:24.915
In the beginning was the word, the word was

300
00:17:24.915 --> 00:17:27.675
with God and the word was God.

301
00:17:30.025 --> 00:17:32.175
Again, this is Emmanuel.

302
00:17:32.525 --> 00:17:36.535
Like if we stop and think this is eman, this God

303
00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:43.235
is who came to be with us, the infinite

304
00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:48.015
taking on the finite, the unlimited being,

305
00:17:49.405 --> 00:17:54.105
taking on a body, all of that

306
00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:58.805
for you and for me, like just let

307
00:17:58.805 --> 00:18:01.205
that spark some worship this Christmas season.

308
00:18:02.085 --> 00:18:03.765
I know it's hard. You hear same thing over

309
00:18:03.765 --> 00:18:07.525
and over every year, like just rest in e Emmanuel this year

310
00:18:08.265 --> 00:18:10.795
and let that fill your heart

311
00:18:10.895 --> 00:18:13.115
and fill your soul with worship for

312
00:18:13.255 --> 00:18:15.715
who this God actually is.

313
00:18:18.485 --> 00:18:20.265
And listen, that was just the first two verses

314
00:18:20.495 --> 00:18:21.705
like we're not even done yet.

315
00:18:24.785 --> 00:18:25.915
Look at what verses three

316
00:18:25.915 --> 00:18:29.235
and four say this is even further than what we just saw.

317
00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:31.335
Look at verses three and four.

318
00:18:32.275 --> 00:18:34.255
All things were made through him

319
00:18:34.995 --> 00:18:38.495
and without him was not anything made that was made

320
00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:44.105
in him was life and the life was the light of men.

321
00:18:46.485 --> 00:18:48.465
Now we'll get to that light concept next week,

322
00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:53.595
but you saw it here right in the beginning here

323
00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.205
in him was life.

324
00:18:58.475 --> 00:18:59.855
That's the, that's the idea here.

325
00:19:01.165 --> 00:19:04.945
We saw what that in the beginning idea shows us now in him

326
00:19:05.325 --> 00:19:06.465
was life.

327
00:19:06.565 --> 00:19:11.505
That's the point this week in this eternal word in this God,

328
00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:15.275
the son in him

329
00:19:16.015 --> 00:19:17.395
was life.

330
00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:21.915
Now I've got it up here, but one

331
00:19:21.915 --> 00:19:26.635
of my favorite board games growing up was the game of life.

332
00:19:27.945 --> 00:19:30.275
Anybody remember this? Look at that hair by the way, right?

333
00:19:30.275 --> 00:19:31.915
Like this, this is the original.

334
00:19:32.305 --> 00:19:33.875
They've changed the game over the years.

335
00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:35.195
They've modified it. Now you can be

336
00:19:35.195 --> 00:19:36.395
a software developer, right?

337
00:19:36.735 --> 00:19:39.275
But, but I'm talking about this one, this one

338
00:19:39.275 --> 00:19:43.595
where a lawyer makes $50,000, 1982, right?

339
00:19:43.735 --> 00:19:46.395
And you get a, I was looking through the game,

340
00:19:46.655 --> 00:19:49.675
you could catch a lion and get a $4,000 reward.

341
00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:53.315
Like who's gonna do that? Where are you catching a lion?

342
00:19:53.315 --> 00:19:56.635
I don't know. But anyway, like the whole point

343
00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:57.915
of this game back then,

344
00:19:58.495 --> 00:20:00.835
but you still look at the rules today, the whole point

345
00:20:00.835 --> 00:20:04.415
of the game, even today, you, you know how you win.

346
00:20:05.845 --> 00:20:10.305
You end up with the most money. That's it.

347
00:20:11.385 --> 00:20:12.835
Everybody finishes the game,

348
00:20:13.915 --> 00:20:18.375
but whoever has the most money at the end wins the game.

349
00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:22.645
Now you hear that

350
00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:26.405
and we all kind of scoff like at least you're better.

351
00:20:26.465 --> 00:20:28.605
So you look respectable to the people around you, right?

352
00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:35.205
But don't we live our lives like that so often, every day

353
00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:37.785
like that is the goal.

354
00:20:38.335 --> 00:20:39.465
That is the end game.

355
00:20:39.615 --> 00:20:41.665
That is the winning task

356
00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.095
because it's not just a board game.

357
00:20:45.275 --> 00:20:49.245
Our culture promotes that as the very way

358
00:20:49.345 --> 00:20:50.885
to win at life.

359
00:20:53.065 --> 00:20:55.525
You've heard it, right? Whoever dies with the most toys

360
00:20:56.035 --> 00:20:57.845
wins wrong.

361
00:20:58.155 --> 00:21:00.525
Whoever dies with the most toys still dies.

362
00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:05.165
It doesn't matter. You have the same fate as everyone else.

363
00:21:05.225 --> 00:21:06.605
It doesn't matter how much money you have,

364
00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:11.225
everyone has the same Listen,

365
00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:14.665
Jesus pierced that so deeply.

366
00:21:14.885 --> 00:21:15.905
Listen to what he says.

367
00:21:15.975 --> 00:21:19.625
Mark 8 36, what does it profit a man

368
00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:22.985
to gain the whole world and yet forfeit his soul?

369
00:21:30.855 --> 00:21:33.435
And we think, okay, well that's people have a lot

370
00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:35.615
of money, greedy people.

371
00:21:36.725 --> 00:21:39.655
That disease is in every single one of us

372
00:21:44.135 --> 00:21:47.265
because you and I are not maybe necessarily searching

373
00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:50.505
for life and money, but we are all searching

374
00:21:50.565 --> 00:21:52.585
for life in so many things.

375
00:21:55.645 --> 00:21:57.385
It could be money, right?

376
00:21:57.385 --> 00:21:59.785
You could be like, well I gotta meet that next milestone.

377
00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:02.385
As soon as I get to that point, then I'm set. We're set.

378
00:22:02.515 --> 00:22:05.625
Right? That that could be where you're finding life

379
00:22:05.805 --> 00:22:08.665
or it could be any number of other things.

380
00:22:11.505 --> 00:22:13.285
You could look for life in your kids.

381
00:22:14.145 --> 00:22:17.775
You could look for life in your status at school

382
00:22:18.475 --> 00:22:20.575
or in your political stances

383
00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:24.375
or in how many followers you have on social media.

384
00:22:26.995 --> 00:22:28.115
'cause what do we mean by life, right?

385
00:22:28.115 --> 00:22:31.915
Let's clear that up for a second. Life is satisfaction.

386
00:22:32.425 --> 00:22:37.315
It's joy, it's fulfillment. Life is pleasure.

387
00:22:37.505 --> 00:22:41.035
It's basically what the Old Testament refers to as shalom,

388
00:22:41.425 --> 00:22:44.595
that idea of peace, that everything is in order.

389
00:22:44.595 --> 00:22:47.795
Everything is as it should be in my life.

390
00:22:48.095 --> 00:22:52.915
And so what we do is we look towards money or sex or sports

391
00:22:53.215 --> 00:22:55.995
or government or promotion to find

392
00:22:56.385 --> 00:22:58.475
that shalom in our lives.

393
00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:07.245
But you know what? They always let you down.

394
00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:12.425
They always let you down.

395
00:23:12.685 --> 00:23:15.785
Go read the whole book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament.

396
00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:20.835
This king of Israel named Solomon could

397
00:23:21.415 --> 00:23:22.715
try everything he wanted.

398
00:23:22.895 --> 00:23:24.075
He could look

399
00:23:24.375 --> 00:23:27.795
for life in everything in the world he could

400
00:23:27.795 --> 00:23:28.875
have ever wanted.

401
00:23:29.055 --> 00:23:31.275
But his conclusion at the end of it is

402
00:23:31.275 --> 00:23:32.435
that it's all meaningless.

403
00:23:33.805 --> 00:23:37.215
It's all vanity, it's all chasing after the wind.

404
00:23:42.455 --> 00:23:44.115
Now he doesn't say that those things can't be

405
00:23:44.115 --> 00:23:45.245
used for good good.

406
00:23:45.395 --> 00:23:49.285
He's saying to us, God is saying to us, those things cannot

407
00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:51.365
sustain life.

408
00:23:56.395 --> 00:24:00.405
Doesn't John one paint a very different picture for us?

409
00:24:02.635 --> 00:24:05.795
It says in him was life.

410
00:24:08.675 --> 00:24:11.775
In this word in God the Son was

411
00:24:12.285 --> 00:24:15.695
life meaning don't look anywhere else for it.

412
00:24:15.765 --> 00:24:20.535
It's found in him. The life we long for is found in him.

413
00:24:20.555 --> 00:24:21.735
And here's why that makes sense.

414
00:24:21.735 --> 00:24:24.215
Lemme show you why this all ties together.

415
00:24:25.015 --> 00:24:29.965
'cause look again at verse three. All things

416
00:24:29.965 --> 00:24:32.205
were made through him, through the word

417
00:24:32.545 --> 00:24:36.325
and without him was not anything made that was made.

418
00:24:36.325 --> 00:24:39.485
This is talking about physical life, right?

419
00:24:40.875 --> 00:24:44.765
That in the word comes physical life.

420
00:24:46.955 --> 00:24:49.725
This is where we're starting. He Hebrews one says the same

421
00:24:49.975 --> 00:24:52.245
thing about God the Son.

422
00:24:52.285 --> 00:24:53.845
Listen to Hebrews one verses two and three.

423
00:24:54.065 --> 00:24:57.285
In these last days, he's spoken to us by his son

424
00:24:58.075 --> 00:25:01.245
whom he appointed the heir of all things through whom

425
00:25:01.755 --> 00:25:03.805
also he created the world.

426
00:25:05.415 --> 00:25:08.915
He the God the Son is the radiance of the glory of God,

427
00:25:09.135 --> 00:25:11.475
the exact imprint of his nature,

428
00:25:11.935 --> 00:25:15.555
and he upholds the universe by the word

429
00:25:15.695 --> 00:25:17.235
of his power.

430
00:25:17.655 --> 00:25:22.275
See that God created all things through His

431
00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:24.555
Son, through the word.

432
00:25:26.255 --> 00:25:29.255
Remember how he did it back in Genesis one, remember that

433
00:25:29.765 --> 00:25:31.535
narrative God created?

434
00:25:31.755 --> 00:25:35.605
How did he create and God

435
00:25:35.915 --> 00:25:38.195
said, let there be light.

436
00:25:38.375 --> 00:25:39.955
God said, let there be animals.

437
00:25:40.375 --> 00:25:43.055
He spoke words

438
00:25:45.515 --> 00:25:46.805
through his word.

439
00:25:47.345 --> 00:25:52.085
He created all things. He upholds all things.

440
00:25:52.235 --> 00:25:54.725
Okay, we get that. Why is that so important for this?

441
00:25:57.645 --> 00:26:00.895
Because if he created everything,

442
00:26:02.655 --> 00:26:06.955
if he designed everything to work in a certain way,

443
00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:09.435
then shouldn't we listen to

444
00:26:09.535 --> 00:26:11.115
how he says we should use it all?

445
00:26:14.585 --> 00:26:16.805
If we're looking for life, if we want things

446
00:26:16.905 --> 00:26:20.205
to work the best, shouldn't we listen to the designer

447
00:26:20.785 --> 00:26:25.255
of everything He created you.

448
00:26:26.825 --> 00:26:30.495
He created me. He created nature.

449
00:26:31.825 --> 00:26:36.525
He created marriage. He created money. He created sex.

450
00:26:36.785 --> 00:26:38.125
He created authority.

451
00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:42.965
He created everything, which means he knows how

452
00:26:43.065 --> 00:26:44.565
to best use it all.

453
00:26:49.295 --> 00:26:50.755
So here's, here's why that matters

454
00:26:50.825 --> 00:26:53.475
because we're seeking life here.

455
00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:58.515
We know and learn is that in him is that abundant life

456
00:26:58.705 --> 00:26:59.635
that we're looking for

457
00:27:03.925 --> 00:27:06.965
physical life, the way he created it, designed it to work.

458
00:27:07.315 --> 00:27:08.525
When we look to him

459
00:27:08.545 --> 00:27:12.205
and we follow him in that abundant life is

460
00:27:12.205 --> 00:27:13.605
what comes from it.

461
00:27:17.845 --> 00:27:21.265
Listen to how Jesus said it in John 10, verse 10.

462
00:27:21.325 --> 00:27:24.825
He compares the way of the world, the way of the enemy, the

463
00:27:24.825 --> 00:27:28.505
what it brings in our lives versus the way he designs it.

464
00:27:28.615 --> 00:27:33.305
John 10 10 says, the thief, the enemy comes only

465
00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:36.185
to steal and kill and destroy.

466
00:27:37.875 --> 00:27:42.795
I came the word God the Son came that they may have life

467
00:27:43.335 --> 00:27:44.395
and have it abundantly,

468
00:27:49.565 --> 00:27:50.585
And I want you to hear this.

469
00:27:51.415 --> 00:27:56.225
That abundant life he's talking about has nothing to do with

470
00:27:56.225 --> 00:27:57.225
how wealthy you are

471
00:27:58.485 --> 00:28:01.475
or with how healthy you are

472
00:28:02.905 --> 00:28:04.725
or whether you are married or not

473
00:28:08.455 --> 00:28:11.275
or whatever else you might think of that that could be part

474
00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:13.435
of what it means to be an abundant life.

475
00:28:13.495 --> 00:28:17.195
No, the abundant life the word has for you involves

476
00:28:17.715 --> 00:28:21.115
flourishing according to his design for you.

477
00:28:24.205 --> 00:28:28.635
Where you live out of this overflow of his love,

478
00:28:28.825 --> 00:28:32.315
that you're spilling out joy, that you're peaceful,

479
00:28:32.315 --> 00:28:34.875
that you're patient, that you see things

480
00:28:35.425 --> 00:28:38.155
show up in your life like kindness and goodness

481
00:28:38.295 --> 00:28:40.195
and faithfulness and gentleness.

482
00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:42.995
The self-control pouring outta your life keeps you from

483
00:28:43.315 --> 00:28:45.195
destruction day after day.

484
00:28:45.255 --> 00:28:47.155
That's what we see the abundant life look like.

485
00:28:50.165 --> 00:28:53.355
Where you're growing in your love for God, your love

486
00:28:53.615 --> 00:28:55.955
for others, even your enemies

487
00:28:56.205 --> 00:28:58.315
where no hatred reigns in your heart.

488
00:28:58.455 --> 00:28:59.675
That's the abundant life

489
00:29:03.255 --> 00:29:06.005
where you're seeing relationships flourish

490
00:29:06.315 --> 00:29:10.725
because they're being handled God's way in a pure way

491
00:29:10.835 --> 00:29:13.685
that you can enjoy the good gifts that God's given

492
00:29:13.705 --> 00:29:15.365
to us in the context that he gave them to us

493
00:29:16.225 --> 00:29:19.265
and it's life giving.

494
00:29:19.895 --> 00:29:24.745
It's abundant Where you're

495
00:29:24.985 --> 00:29:27.145
watching your generosity, bless others

496
00:29:27.805 --> 00:29:30.185
as you steward the many resources

497
00:29:30.205 --> 00:29:32.865
or the few resources that God has entrusted to you

498
00:29:33.165 --> 00:29:36.985
and you're watching him use you in those ways where you're

499
00:29:37.865 --> 00:29:41.605
participating in God's ministry to His people

500
00:29:41.945 --> 00:29:45.165
as you're serving others with your time, with your talents,

501
00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:47.085
as you're watching him work through you,

502
00:29:47.305 --> 00:29:49.405
as you're seeing him bless others through you.

503
00:29:49.545 --> 00:29:50.725
That's the abundant life.

504
00:29:54.205 --> 00:29:55.825
See, that is the good life.

505
00:29:56.205 --> 00:29:57.265
Not what the games

506
00:29:57.485 --> 00:29:59.265
and the world will tell you is the good life.

507
00:29:59.405 --> 00:30:02.665
That's the good life in Him was life.

508
00:30:03.005 --> 00:30:04.665
In him is life.

509
00:30:04.965 --> 00:30:07.345
It has nothing to do with any of that other stuff.

510
00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:10.145
It has everything to do with who you're living for.

511
00:30:12.585 --> 00:30:16.835
Like when I see him as my life, as my source,

512
00:30:17.295 --> 00:30:21.915
as my joy, then I'm freed up to that abundant life

513
00:30:22.415 --> 00:30:25.515
to live everything out He's promised me to live.

514
00:30:28.925 --> 00:30:30.985
That's the abundant life. You know where that starts though?

515
00:30:32.605 --> 00:30:34.375
Like we'd love that. We'd long for that.

516
00:30:34.515 --> 00:30:38.375
You know where that starts? It starts by seeing him

517
00:30:38.595 --> 00:30:40.015
as your spiritual life.

518
00:30:40.465 --> 00:30:45.435
First. We want the abundant life.

519
00:30:46.895 --> 00:30:48.205
We're looking for it every

520
00:30:48.225 --> 00:30:53.225
day it starts.

521
00:30:54.395 --> 00:30:56.785
God's design for that starts when you see him

522
00:30:57.005 --> 00:30:59.185
as your spiritual life.

523
00:30:59.185 --> 00:31:03.745
Because we are, hear me, our world doesn't say this.

524
00:31:03.845 --> 00:31:06.065
Nobody agrees with this outside of this room.

525
00:31:06.065 --> 00:31:10.745
It seems like we are dead spiritually on our own.

526
00:31:13.525 --> 00:31:16.015
Every human born of a man

527
00:31:16.015 --> 00:31:19.575
and a woman dead spiritually on our own

528
00:31:21.005 --> 00:31:22.265
and there's nothing we can do about it.

529
00:31:26.255 --> 00:31:31.055
The only way out is for the life, the resurrection

530
00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:35.895
and the life to reach into that dead tomb we are in

531
00:31:36.275 --> 00:31:39.735
and make us alive spiritually

532
00:31:39.885 --> 00:31:42.655
through his merciful and loving life, death

533
00:31:42.655 --> 00:31:43.855
and resurrection in our place.

534
00:31:46.225 --> 00:31:48.445
If you're dead, you can't make yourself alive.

535
00:31:48.465 --> 00:31:50.765
You have to have someone who's alive reach into it

536
00:31:50.865 --> 00:31:52.525
and make you alive.

537
00:31:52.985 --> 00:31:54.365
How do you get that new life?

538
00:31:54.385 --> 00:31:56.805
How do you become spiritually alive?

539
00:31:57.025 --> 00:32:00.405
It is not by works so that no one can boast.

540
00:32:00.635 --> 00:32:04.405
It's only by placing your faith in the free gift of God

541
00:32:04.905 --> 00:32:07.485
for you, his eternal life for you.

542
00:32:09.615 --> 00:32:11.475
You've heard this before. You've seen it on the signs

543
00:32:11.475 --> 00:32:13.875
behind the field, goals at a football game, John three 16,

544
00:32:14.375 --> 00:32:18.955
for God so loved the world that he gave his only son

545
00:32:19.105 --> 00:32:21.835
that whoever believes in him shall not

546
00:32:21.835 --> 00:32:23.075
perish but have eternal life.

547
00:32:25.285 --> 00:32:26.375
John 5 24.

548
00:32:26.465 --> 00:32:28.735
Truly I say to you, whoever hears my word

549
00:32:28.915 --> 00:32:32.415
and believes him who sent me has eternal life.

550
00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:35.665
He does not commit a judgment.

551
00:32:35.815 --> 00:32:38.505
He's passed from death to life.

552
00:32:39.005 --> 00:32:40.405
Remember the story about Easter, right?

553
00:32:41.005 --> 00:32:42.645
Christmas coming up, but Easter matters

554
00:32:43.145 --> 00:32:45.965
to Jesus came out of the grave alive.

555
00:32:46.385 --> 00:32:50.485
He died, but passed from death to life.

556
00:32:50.955 --> 00:32:52.765
That Jesus right there says,

557
00:32:53.065 --> 00:32:56.245
if you believe you have passed from death to life

558
00:32:57.755 --> 00:32:59.365
spiritually alive,

559
00:33:03.195 --> 00:33:06.935
you have eternal life and that eternal life, listen, is yes,

560
00:33:08.005 --> 00:33:10.055
certainly life that lasts forever

561
00:33:10.165 --> 00:33:11.935
with God in the new heavens and new earth.

562
00:33:12.635 --> 00:33:15.085
Yes, praise God that that's coming,

563
00:33:17.375 --> 00:33:19.355
but it's so much more than that too.

564
00:33:21.245 --> 00:33:22.495
Eternal life is

565
00:33:22.595 --> 00:33:27.415
so much more than merely fire insurance for after you die.

566
00:33:31.735 --> 00:33:35.915
It is a new awakening, a new life

567
00:33:36.455 --> 00:33:38.995
inside you that begins when you believe.

568
00:33:42.275 --> 00:33:45.695
Listen to what Jesus said, John 17, verse three.

569
00:33:46.235 --> 00:33:49.495
He said, this is eternal life

570
00:33:50.005 --> 00:33:54.015
that they know you Father, the only true God

571
00:33:54.275 --> 00:33:56.775
and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.

572
00:33:58.175 --> 00:34:01.965
Do you see that this? Jesus says it. He defines it.

573
00:34:02.035 --> 00:34:05.835
This is eternal life. What does he say it is?

574
00:34:08.755 --> 00:34:11.285
It's not fire insurance. It's not heaven.

575
00:34:11.675 --> 00:34:15.485
Eternal life is a living, breathing,

576
00:34:15.915 --> 00:34:18.685
real relationship with this God of the universe.

577
00:34:22.535 --> 00:34:27.165
He says, that's eternal, that we know,

578
00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:32.405
that we know intimately know the only true

579
00:34:32.825 --> 00:34:35.605
God through the word that he has sent.

580
00:34:39.645 --> 00:34:42.655
Like what? What great grace is it church

581
00:34:45.155 --> 00:34:49.845
that this Emmanuel, this God with us, this glorious,

582
00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:53.885
glorious God, yet near to us, God with us,

583
00:34:54.075 --> 00:34:58.445
that he would come to accomplish all of this so that you

584
00:34:58.445 --> 00:35:01.565
and I could know him and be with him forever.

585
00:35:02.455 --> 00:35:04.955
Is that not just a stunning grace to us?

586
00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:14.875
Do you believe it? Do,

587
00:35:14.975 --> 00:35:19.785
do you believe and see him as your source of life

588
00:35:21.905 --> 00:35:26.305
today and every day and for eternity?

589
00:35:27.835 --> 00:35:29.975
Do you see him as life?

590
00:35:29.975 --> 00:35:33.615
Listen, you will never find true life

591
00:35:35.325 --> 00:35:37.485
until you truly follow Jesus

592
00:35:41.095 --> 00:35:42.795
In Him is life.

593
00:35:45.605 --> 00:35:50.325
Let's bow our heads together just

594
00:35:50.325 --> 00:35:51.845
to reflect on that for a moment.

595
00:35:59.315 --> 00:36:00.725
That idea of God with us,

596
00:36:04.915 --> 00:36:08.295
the word eternal God, the Son

597
00:36:11.865 --> 00:36:16.355
taking on flesh to accomplish everything needed

598
00:36:16.455 --> 00:36:18.435
for our eternal life.

599
00:36:23.975 --> 00:36:24.675
Do you believe that?

600
00:36:32.865 --> 00:36:35.155
Have you seen those facts, those truths,

601
00:36:36.645 --> 00:36:38.235
maybe mentally agreed to that?

602
00:36:38.265 --> 00:36:40.675
Yeah. Okay, and maybe you were even baptized

603
00:36:41.295 --> 00:36:42.515
at some point when you were little,

604
00:36:46.255 --> 00:36:47.595
but you're seeing now you've never

605
00:36:48.115 --> 00:36:49.475
actually said Jesus, I'm in.

606
00:36:49.695 --> 00:36:54.635
I'm all in. I see you as my savior and my Lord I'm in.

607
00:36:54.895 --> 00:36:57.915
Do you believe that's the way the word means? Believe it.

608
00:36:59.495 --> 00:37:00.875
Not just agree to it. Believe it.

609
00:37:04.095 --> 00:37:05.195
I'm not saying you have

610
00:37:05.195 --> 00:37:08.715
to feel it hard enough this Sunday versus last year

611
00:37:08.775 --> 00:37:10.475
or camp this year versus last year.

612
00:37:10.475 --> 00:37:11.875
That's not what I'm saying. It's not a feeling.

613
00:37:12.065 --> 00:37:14.995
It's like, God, I'm in. I don't have any other hope.

614
00:37:16.135 --> 00:37:16.835
Do you believe that?

615
00:37:22.215 --> 00:37:26.155
If you don't, why wait?

616
00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:31.075
Why? If you see it, if you agree with it, say, God, I'm in.

617
00:37:31.235 --> 00:37:32.515
I believe I'm yours.

618
00:37:34.225 --> 00:37:35.955
Just cry out to him in your heart right now.

619
00:37:37.245 --> 00:37:39.755
Admit you're a sinner. Believe that he came to save you

620
00:37:39.855 --> 00:37:42.195
and did all of this, that he is who he says he is.

621
00:37:42.625 --> 00:37:44.875
Confess him as Lord of your life

622
00:37:47.295 --> 00:37:48.435
And tell somebody about it.

623
00:37:52.615 --> 00:37:55.355
But if you do believe this, if this is your hope,

624
00:37:58.245 --> 00:38:02.515
maybe use this next few minutes to reflect on

625
00:38:02.535 --> 00:38:05.395
how we've sought life in so many other things.

626
00:38:05.455 --> 00:38:10.275
Me included every day finding,

627
00:38:10.745 --> 00:38:13.595
looking for joy, peace,

628
00:38:14.935 --> 00:38:16.275
and everything else but him.

629
00:38:16.375 --> 00:38:20.595
God, forgive us for that. Forgive me for that.

630
00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:24.435
That I so flippantly

631
00:38:25.135 --> 00:38:28.595
handle my relationship with the God of the universe who came

632
00:38:28.615 --> 00:38:30.435
to be with us, not just came to be with us.

633
00:38:30.545 --> 00:38:32.595
Live inside of us as your people,

634
00:38:35.185 --> 00:38:36.845
and we just treat it as if it's nothing.

635
00:38:38.745 --> 00:38:40.485
As if everything else is way more important.

636
00:38:40.545 --> 00:38:44.405
God forgive us for that. It is. It's your breath.

637
00:38:44.505 --> 00:38:47.085
You are the very giver of life in our lungs,

638
00:38:47.085 --> 00:38:48.285
and so what else would we do?

639
00:38:48.285 --> 00:38:52.845
But use that to praise you, to use our lives

640
00:38:52.845 --> 00:38:54.885
that you've given to us, to live for you.

641
00:38:55.025 --> 00:38:58.685
God forgive us for selfish living.

642
00:39:03.785 --> 00:39:06.645
May we give our whole hearts to you even today

643
00:39:07.065 --> 00:39:11.245
and see you work in powerful, abundant ways.

644
00:39:12.295 --> 00:39:13.045
Thank you, God.
