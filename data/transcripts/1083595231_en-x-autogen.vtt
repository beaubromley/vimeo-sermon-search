1
00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:36.545
I am pretty sure I have the best mom in

2
00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:37.665
the entire world up.

3
00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:41.105
Have somebody ready to debate already. Okay.

4
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:42.585
I know that's subjective. I get that.

5
00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:44.785
I hope you do feel the same way about your mom.

6
00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:47.745
I I, I also want to acknowledge that not everybody does.

7
00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:50.505
And so know that we feel that, sorry

8
00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:52.865
for your experience, if that's yours.

9
00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.265
But I, I've been blessed.

10
00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:57.625
It's the grace of God in my life

11
00:00:57.685 --> 00:00:59.105
to have the mom that I have.

12
00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:01.465
I'm not just saying that 'cause I forgot

13
00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:02.985
to get her a card today on Mother's Day,

14
00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:05.345
but, um, I, I genuinely mean that.

15
00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:07.585
I I do Many of you know our story.

16
00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:10.545
Uh, my family has experienced a lot.

17
00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:13.105
My parents got divorced when I was a freshman in high

18
00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:16.945
school, and my sisters had two strokes in the last 15 years.

19
00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:20.025
And so my mom is a warrior

20
00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:23.905
and she has prayed for decades

21
00:01:24.205 --> 00:01:26.185
and carried in many ways our family

22
00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:29.905
and has cared for us in real,

23
00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:31.625
real deep ways.

24
00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:34.665
And so just wanna praise God for that.

25
00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:36.145
And, uh, I've said this

26
00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:39.425
before, I know that I am not who I am today without my mom.

27
00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:41.705
And so just want to acknowledge that.

28
00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:46.745
But as I say that, even preparing to say that, uh,

29
00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:48.505
that it brings up a bit of a tension in me

30
00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:53.185
because I know at the same time that there is a,

31
00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:56.425
a measure of me not loving her well in return,

32
00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:00.025
in response to her great love for me.

33
00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:04.545
I didn't take it. Uh, I, I took it for granted.

34
00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:06.465
And uh, I've sought to be better.

35
00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:07.945
But historically I just have not

36
00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:12.185
done a great job making sure that she feels loved,

37
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:13.785
like the ways that she loved me

38
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:17.025
and cared for, like, uh, she cared for me in those ways.

39
00:02:18.685 --> 00:02:20.305
Always a great way to start a sermon

40
00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:22.945
with a controversial statement and a confession.

41
00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:24.625
So, uh, why do I tell you that?

42
00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:31.105
Well, even more important than the way that we love our moms

43
00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:36.165
is what we're gonna talk about today.

44
00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:39.645
A genuine love for God

45
00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:44.805
and for others in response to God's great love for us.

46
00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:50.755
This realigned series we're talking about

47
00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:56.195
has been showing us the perfect standard of Christ,

48
00:02:57.215 --> 00:03:00.725
how he's been pulling us toward the perfect standard

49
00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:02.605
of vertical that he set.

50
00:03:03.465 --> 00:03:04.805
That's what we're doing all summer.

51
00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:07.925
But, but this piece today is so important.

52
00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:10.405
I think we're talking about genuine love.

53
00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:12.165
I think this one is so important to, because,

54
00:03:12.835 --> 00:03:14.685
because most of us in the room today

55
00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:17.765
just assume we are loving.

56
00:03:20.115 --> 00:03:21.935
If I would ask you, you'd say, of course I am.

57
00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:26.575
Well, often what we will do is we'll try to set the standard

58
00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:30.815
of vertical, this love standard ourselves

59
00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:33.335
from the bottom up and,

60
00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:36.095
and we'll conform to others

61
00:03:37.605 --> 00:03:40.175
leading us to think that, that this standard,

62
00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:41.615
what we've set in the world

63
00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:44.055
or what others would say, this is vertical.

64
00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:46.135
And so we are not that far off from it

65
00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:50.535
if we're going according to this standard or that standard.

66
00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:54.455
But, but again, when we set the vertical from above of

67
00:03:56.315 --> 00:03:58.925
when we let Jesus's life be the standard,

68
00:04:00.145 --> 00:04:04.115
when when we look at his love, then we realize

69
00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:07.775
how far off we actually are from that.

70
00:04:10.515 --> 00:04:14.175
And so what I wanna show you today is how,

71
00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:16.255
what we're studying in this whole chapter

72
00:04:16.275 --> 00:04:18.935
of Romans chapter 12, how, how all of it

73
00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:23.175
is really just an extended display of

74
00:04:23.565 --> 00:04:26.655
what love looks like in a transformed life.

75
00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:30.615
Like if you've been changed by Jesus,

76
00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:35.855
this whole chapter is what love looks like for you,

77
00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:41.225
really, how, how God's love for us

78
00:04:42.775 --> 00:04:44.625
changes us so much

79
00:04:44.935 --> 00:04:48.185
that we love God completely differently because of it.

80
00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:52.225
That that it changes us, that we love others in the church

81
00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:55.865
so differently, that we also even love

82
00:04:56.685 --> 00:04:58.665
our enemies very differently.

83
00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:01.585
And where does that come from?

84
00:05:04.405 --> 00:05:08.065
Romans five verse eight says, God shows his love

85
00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:13.145
for us in that while we were still sinners,

86
00:05:14.255 --> 00:05:17.425
enemies, Christ died for us.

87
00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:21.385
So God, that's your standard.

88
00:05:24.535 --> 00:05:26.705
This is not complicated here today,

89
00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:31.865
but it is impossible for us

90
00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:35.225
to do apart from your love for us.

91
00:05:35.325 --> 00:05:37.385
And so, God, I pray you'd open our hearts today,

92
00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:40.705
open our lives that we would be willing, ready to hear

93
00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:45.305
and receive and act on in love for you, what you've shown us

94
00:05:45.305 --> 00:05:46.865
and given us in Christ.

95
00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:50.755
This is your word. Do your work through it, God,

96
00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:53.075
in Jesus' name, amen.

97
00:05:54.735 --> 00:05:57.645
So turn with me back now to Romans 12,

98
00:05:59.805 --> 00:06:00.855
this chapter, we're gonna work

99
00:06:00.855 --> 00:06:02.415
through all summer, Romans 12.

100
00:06:02.415 --> 00:06:03.535
What I want you to look at

101
00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:05.455
as we get there is just the first

102
00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:06.655
couple words of verse nine.

103
00:06:07.515 --> 00:06:09.655
So Romans chapter 12, big number 12,

104
00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:10.975
little number nine under that.

105
00:06:11.035 --> 00:06:13.415
And it's gonna be on your notes as well. It's really simple.

106
00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:14.655
Just four words today.

107
00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:18.895
That's all we're gonna study, but it'll be so rich.

108
00:06:20.085 --> 00:06:22.265
Romans 12 verse nine,

109
00:06:24.315 --> 00:06:28.585
first four words say this, let love

110
00:06:29.165 --> 00:06:30.385
be genuine.

111
00:06:34.155 --> 00:06:36.615
Let love be genuine.

112
00:06:37.205 --> 00:06:39.055
That word genuine brings with it the idea

113
00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:42.455
of not having hypocrisy, that you're not putting on a front.

114
00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:43.935
It's not fake, it's real.

115
00:06:44.055 --> 00:06:47.055
I love how verse nine reads in the new living translation.

116
00:06:47.055 --> 00:06:49.575
It says, don't just pretend to love others.

117
00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:53.895
Really love them. A lot of pretending in the world.

118
00:06:54.475 --> 00:06:55.615
That's not what we're talking about.

119
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.255
We're talking about genuine real love.

120
00:06:58.255 --> 00:07:00.135
And I think that's the thread that runs

121
00:07:00.135 --> 00:07:02.935
through the entire chapter of Romans 12.

122
00:07:03.075 --> 00:07:06.695
I'm gonna argue that the whole thing is really about love.

123
00:07:07.555 --> 00:07:08.615
It says a lot of different words,

124
00:07:08.615 --> 00:07:11.895
but it's all about how you truly love God.

125
00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:14.575
How you truly love your brothers and sisters in the church,

126
00:07:14.675 --> 00:07:17.175
and how you truly love your enemies.

127
00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:18.535
That's what it's all about.

128
00:07:18.635 --> 00:07:21.695
But here again, we can't start there.

129
00:07:23.325 --> 00:07:24.455
Like I can't just say to you,

130
00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:25.615
all right, let's go love each other.

131
00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:27.695
Let's go love the Lord. Let's go love the enemies.

132
00:07:27.795 --> 00:07:29.055
We can't just go with that

133
00:07:29.055 --> 00:07:32.135
because what that turns into then is a moralistic message

134
00:07:32.365 --> 00:07:36.495
that just beats us up and tells us how far we are from God

135
00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:37.695
because we can't do it very well.

136
00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:40.575
And you're discouraged walking out of here

137
00:07:40.755 --> 00:07:43.735
or tomorrow at least instead of encouraged.

138
00:07:43.735 --> 00:07:46.655
That's why the foundation we set today is so critical.

139
00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:52.255
The foundation we must start with is

140
00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:57.145
that God first loved us, not

141
00:07:57.325 --> 00:07:58.345
how we should be loving.

142
00:08:00.085 --> 00:08:01.505
How did God love us? First?

143
00:08:04.325 --> 00:08:08.225
He first loved us, which is how first John four,

144
00:08:08.275 --> 00:08:11.025
verse 10 puts it, the foundation of our love.

145
00:08:11.035 --> 00:08:14.545
Watch this in. This is love.

146
00:08:15.685 --> 00:08:19.745
Not that we've loved God, but that he loved us

147
00:08:20.405 --> 00:08:24.105
and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins.

148
00:08:28.515 --> 00:08:30.735
See that this, this is what love looks like.

149
00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:33.135
That's what it says, right? This is love.

150
00:08:34.555 --> 00:08:35.575
Not your love for him.

151
00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:40.415
The love is, is not some bottom up standard that we set.

152
00:08:40.415 --> 00:08:42.415
The world says this is how love looks like.

153
00:08:42.415 --> 00:08:44.175
This is what you should do if you love someone.

154
00:08:44.355 --> 00:08:47.015
No, it's not measured also by how we love God.

155
00:08:47.045 --> 00:08:48.175
It's not any of that.

156
00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:53.135
Love is exemplified by the fact that God loved us first

157
00:08:55.455 --> 00:08:59.595
and not just in a sentimental feelings based kind of way.

158
00:08:59.615 --> 00:09:02.275
It wasn't any of that He loved in an active

159
00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:04.835
sacrificial kind of way.

160
00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:12.705
God, the Father sent God the Son to be the offering

161
00:09:13.205 --> 00:09:17.945
for our sin to be the sacrifice that would fully atone

162
00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:19.345
for his people's sin.

163
00:09:19.895 --> 00:09:22.945
That is love. We deserve his wrath.

164
00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.585
We deserve his anger as his enemies.

165
00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:29.505
Yet, because God is love, he did what he did.

166
00:09:29.725 --> 00:09:33.305
He offered his son to pay the penalty for our sin.

167
00:09:36.685 --> 00:09:41.145
That's love that. That is sacrificial.

168
00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:44.585
That's the standard. That is the vertical standard of love.

169
00:09:44.635 --> 00:09:46.665
There is no other way we can define love

170
00:09:46.965 --> 00:09:48.105
as the world might try.

171
00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:49.785
There's no other way. This is love.

172
00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:56.865
That is our life's foundation. Okay, so great, we agree.

173
00:09:57.135 --> 00:10:00.735
What do we do with that? What does

174
00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:02.535
that do for us?

175
00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:04.915
Then what do we do with it?

176
00:10:08.225 --> 00:10:10.325
Romans 12, Right?

177
00:10:10.665 --> 00:10:12.685
Romans one through 11 is this long

178
00:10:12.915 --> 00:10:14.605
explanation of that of love.

179
00:10:14.775 --> 00:10:16.845
God's love for us, his salvation of us.

180
00:10:16.945 --> 00:10:20.205
That's how he did it. Remember what verse one started

181
00:10:20.205 --> 00:10:21.325
with in Romans 12?

182
00:10:22.345 --> 00:10:25.885
Go back to it. I appeal to you therefore

183
00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:31.755
because of what he did, because of God's love.

184
00:10:32.225 --> 00:10:36.715
Therefore, I appeal to you brothers, by the mercies of God,

185
00:10:36.735 --> 00:10:39.315
the love of God to present your bodies

186
00:10:39.375 --> 00:10:41.795
as a living sacrifice, holy

187
00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:44.515
and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.

188
00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:48.035
Do not be conformed to this world,

189
00:10:48.295 --> 00:10:52.035
but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that

190
00:10:52.035 --> 00:10:54.195
by testing you may discern what is the will of God.

191
00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:56.555
What is good and acceptable and perfect.

192
00:10:58.495 --> 00:11:01.395
So we talked about a couple weeks ago, right, that,

193
00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:02.555
that this is the idea that

194
00:11:02.555 --> 00:11:04.435
because of God's abundant mercies,

195
00:11:04.435 --> 00:11:07.675
because he's made you dead to sin

196
00:11:07.675 --> 00:11:10.955
because he's made you alive to God in Christ

197
00:11:10.955 --> 00:11:12.715
because he's done all of that.

198
00:11:13.545 --> 00:11:17.625
Worship Him, right? Worship, that's what it says.

199
00:11:17.815 --> 00:11:19.305
Open your hands of your life.

200
00:11:19.565 --> 00:11:21.185
Get off the throne of your own heart.

201
00:11:21.245 --> 00:11:23.985
Let Jesus reign on the throne of your heart, say to God,

202
00:11:24.165 --> 00:11:25.345
God, you've given me everything.

203
00:11:25.405 --> 00:11:28.025
So I'm gonna give you everything that's worship.

204
00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:30.705
It's not just singing, it's not just giving.

205
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.025
It's not just serving. It is all of me.

206
00:11:33.045 --> 00:11:34.865
God, I'm all for you.

207
00:11:34.925 --> 00:11:37.425
I'm dying to myself to give you myself.

208
00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:41.085
And he's gonna realign your mind.

209
00:11:41.085 --> 00:11:44.125
He's gonna realign your will to obey his will.

210
00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:46.565
That's what he does in it.

211
00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:50.165
And so what we're saying in essence is that in response

212
00:11:50.265 --> 00:11:54.845
to God's love for us, we are then

213
00:11:54.865 --> 00:11:57.125
to love our God wholeheartedly.

214
00:11:58.135 --> 00:11:59.365
Right? That's what verses one

215
00:11:59.365 --> 00:12:03.595
and two say, basically in response to God's love,

216
00:12:03.695 --> 00:12:05.435
the foundation of his love, what do we do?

217
00:12:05.575 --> 00:12:07.555
We love him wholeheartedly.

218
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:14.645
And like verse nine says, genuinely, we're not acting.

219
00:12:15.075 --> 00:12:16.205
It's without hypocrisy.

220
00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:20.205
We love God genuinely with all that we are.

221
00:12:21.945 --> 00:12:23.165
But what does that actually mean? Uh,

222
00:12:23.425 --> 00:12:25.485
of course I'm writing this all week and thinking about these

223
00:12:25.505 --> 00:12:27.285
and so I'm, I'm asking questions

224
00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:28.685
that I think you're, I'm asking.

225
00:12:28.785 --> 00:12:33.655
And so when we say it all the time, love God with all

226
00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:36.335
that we are, do we really actually know what that means?

227
00:12:37.285 --> 00:12:40.095
Like I wanna be careful there. I wanna be clear.

228
00:12:40.835 --> 00:12:43.455
Do we really love God? How do we do that?

229
00:12:44.895 --> 00:12:49.235
Well go back to the way God loved us. How did he prove it?

230
00:12:49.855 --> 00:12:52.235
He didn't just say it though.

231
00:12:52.235 --> 00:12:53.755
He certainly says that He loves us.

232
00:12:54.055 --> 00:12:55.995
He didn't just say it right.

233
00:12:56.215 --> 00:13:01.125
He sacrificed his son to say, I love you

234
00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:03.205
to show us that He loves us.

235
00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:05.885
It was active, it was tangible.

236
00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:09.885
It was meeting a specific need that we had

237
00:13:10.065 --> 00:13:12.085
and he knew he could provide for it.

238
00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:17.505
You may have heard of a book called The Five Love Languages.

239
00:13:17.775 --> 00:13:20.025
It's often used in marriage and counseling

240
00:13:20.025 --> 00:13:21.105
and things like that.

241
00:13:22.045 --> 00:13:23.985
I'm not all in on it, so just take it or leave it.

242
00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:28.545
But, but I at least know that my wife is not a gifts person.

243
00:13:29.845 --> 00:13:32.905
She is words of affirmation and physical touch.

244
00:13:33.005 --> 00:13:35.425
And so if I go into Mother's Day,

245
00:13:35.775 --> 00:13:39.425
just strictly thinking gifts, if I just go flowers, if I go

246
00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:40.945
with, uh, presents

247
00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:42.945
and all these things, if that's all the way, it's like I,

248
00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:44.345
I think that's how she should be loved.

249
00:13:44.565 --> 00:13:47.065
I'm gonna give her gifts and that I'm gonna miss it, right?

250
00:13:48.085 --> 00:13:49.425
But be completely off base.

251
00:13:49.455 --> 00:13:52.065
What I need to do is make sure that I tell her all the time

252
00:13:52.085 --> 00:13:53.145
how much she means to me.

253
00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:55.705
How great a mom she is, how great a wife she is.

254
00:13:55.905 --> 00:13:58.105
I need to tell, I need to hold her hand. I need to hug her.

255
00:13:58.145 --> 00:14:00.705
I need to be all present with her in those kinda ways.

256
00:14:00.765 --> 00:14:03.065
That's what she needs. 'cause I know that's what's going

257
00:14:03.065 --> 00:14:05.505
to meet her greatest need.

258
00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:08.865
It's similar but much greater with God.

259
00:14:10.355 --> 00:14:13.775
He knew that our greatest need was to be forgiven

260
00:14:13.775 --> 00:14:17.615
of our sin, to be freed from the bondage of sin

261
00:14:18.515 --> 00:14:20.575
and to be brought back into relationship with him.

262
00:14:20.595 --> 00:14:22.695
And so what did he do? He sacrificed his

263
00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:23.975
son to make it happen.

264
00:14:26.135 --> 00:14:28.515
He didn't just give us a better life.

265
00:14:28.815 --> 00:14:30.395
He didn't just make our lives comfortable

266
00:14:30.395 --> 00:14:32.115
because that's not our greatest need.

267
00:14:32.115 --> 00:14:34.515
Our greatest need was to be forgiven.

268
00:14:34.655 --> 00:14:38.355
And so he paid the price to make that happen. That's love.

269
00:14:42.495 --> 00:14:45.795
And that is what should spark our love for him.

270
00:14:46.705 --> 00:14:49.395
That is what should then turn our hearts towards

271
00:14:49.505 --> 00:14:50.675
obedience for him.

272
00:14:50.945 --> 00:14:53.685
Our willingness to give our lives for him

273
00:14:53.865 --> 00:14:55.685
to do things his way, not our way.

274
00:14:55.905 --> 00:15:00.365
To spend time with him, to cherish him, to worship him.

275
00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:03.325
That when we remember his love for us is

276
00:15:03.325 --> 00:15:05.245
what then sparks our love

277
00:15:05.785 --> 00:15:09.935
for him again.

278
00:15:09.935 --> 00:15:14.435
Jesus said, the most important commandment is for you

279
00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:18.115
and I to love the Lord our God with all of our heart, soul,

280
00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:21.195
and mind with everything we are.

281
00:15:21.195 --> 00:15:24.075
That is the absolute most important thing we can do.

282
00:15:24.175 --> 00:15:26.195
That's what life has to be all about.

283
00:15:30.475 --> 00:15:32.415
As we talk about this though, I want to, I wanna be

284
00:15:34.075 --> 00:15:35.975
giving you a couple cautions.

285
00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:39.375
There are a couple traps we can fall into

286
00:15:39.445 --> 00:15:40.455
when we're talking about this.

287
00:15:42.795 --> 00:15:44.335
So I wanna share two traps.

288
00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:46.935
One for all of us, but then one more specifically

289
00:15:46.955 --> 00:15:48.655
for those in leadership.

290
00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:52.455
But here's one trap that, that you might be,

291
00:15:52.655 --> 00:15:54.215
I could easily fall into.

292
00:15:56.235 --> 00:15:58.895
One trap is that when we talk about loving God with all

293
00:15:58.895 --> 00:16:03.775
that we are, it's possible for you

294
00:16:03.795 --> 00:16:08.095
to love God vicariously through

295
00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:12.175
someone else to try to do that.

296
00:16:12.845 --> 00:16:16.575
Whether that's me or whether that's an online influencer,

297
00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:20.375
or whether that's some kind of a CG leader in your life

298
00:16:20.395 --> 00:16:21.495
or, or, or whatever it is.

299
00:16:21.555 --> 00:16:23.415
And, and what you're doing is you hope that

300
00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:26.695
by coming in here or by watching that reel

301
00:16:26.715 --> 00:16:29.535
or watching that sermon, that somehow their love

302
00:16:29.535 --> 00:16:31.375
for God will rub off on you.

303
00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:35.405
Like, man, I love going to that church

304
00:16:35.405 --> 00:16:37.845
because those people love God so much,

305
00:16:38.775 --> 00:16:40.405
those people, right?

306
00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:42.165
And I just, I just love being around.

307
00:16:42.245 --> 00:16:43.605
I kinda get caught in the wash.

308
00:16:43.805 --> 00:16:46.325
I I get in the coattails of their love.

309
00:16:46.325 --> 00:16:50.165
And, and you just hope that somehow it will rub off on you.

310
00:16:50.265 --> 00:16:51.685
Listen, that's not how this works.

311
00:16:54.935 --> 00:16:58.505
It's, it's not possible for me to love God for you and,

312
00:16:58.505 --> 00:17:00.985
and grow your love for God by virtue of me.

313
00:17:00.985 --> 00:17:02.505
Uh, it's, it just doesn't work that way.

314
00:17:04.365 --> 00:17:07.825
You know, you can meet with this God too.

315
00:17:10.045 --> 00:17:11.065
You have the same access.

316
00:17:11.065 --> 00:17:12.985
It's not like a special class of Christians

317
00:17:13.175 --> 00:17:14.385
that you're not a part of,

318
00:17:14.485 --> 00:17:16.625
and you're not gonna be able to know God like they do.

319
00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:18.865
It's possible you have the same Holy Spirit

320
00:17:18.865 --> 00:17:20.225
and the same word of God,

321
00:17:21.405 --> 00:17:23.825
and you can meet with him if you are a believer

322
00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:25.665
just like I can.

323
00:17:27.285 --> 00:17:29.145
And so that's a trap that you can fall into

324
00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:32.265
and just say, I'm gonna ride on their momentum.

325
00:17:33.045 --> 00:17:34.585
That's not what we need to be about.

326
00:17:36.885 --> 00:17:37.905
But lemme give you the flip side.

327
00:17:37.905 --> 00:17:39.065
Here's another trap that I

328
00:17:39.285 --> 00:17:41.825
and other leaders could be falling into.

329
00:17:41.845 --> 00:17:44.945
In fact, our leadership team on staff went to a retreat,

330
00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:48.025
a conference this week, and this God wrecked me on this one.

331
00:17:49.225 --> 00:17:51.725
Uh, So I've been dealing with this all week.

332
00:17:51.745 --> 00:17:54.405
But, but here's, here's the temptation for me

333
00:17:54.505 --> 00:17:55.805
or even for you.

334
00:17:57.765 --> 00:18:02.005
I, I am tempted to go through the motions

335
00:18:02.005 --> 00:18:06.115
of loving God merely for you instead of

336
00:18:06.215 --> 00:18:08.115
for intimacy with God myself.

337
00:18:10.505 --> 00:18:13.555
Meaning I know I have to come on Sunday

338
00:18:13.665 --> 00:18:14.875
with something ready to go.

339
00:18:16.235 --> 00:18:17.995
I know that I have to act a certain way.

340
00:18:18.115 --> 00:18:19.395
I have to know the Bible enough.

341
00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:22.955
I have, I have to do all these things in my position so

342
00:18:22.955 --> 00:18:26.635
that you don't think I'm unqualified.

343
00:18:26.715 --> 00:18:28.035
Like I have to be able to like,

344
00:18:28.035 --> 00:18:29.835
and so there's temptations that come up

345
00:18:29.845 --> 00:18:31.755
where I know I have to be ready.

346
00:18:32.135 --> 00:18:36.635
And all I'm doing it for at times is for

347
00:18:38.215 --> 00:18:40.995
the ungenuine way to present myself to you.

348
00:18:42.615 --> 00:18:45.345
It's the exact opposite of verse nine. Let love be genuine.

349
00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:48.505
Mine is that, that that can be hip hypocrisy, right?

350
00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:53.465
It's loving God merely so that you think I do.

351
00:18:54.845 --> 00:18:56.345
And that's so wicked, isn't it?

352
00:18:59.215 --> 00:19:01.515
How, how immature do we get when those things, like,

353
00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:03.515
I'm just hoping that they love God enough that I can kind

354
00:19:03.515 --> 00:19:07.435
of ride in on them with no, like, how immature are we here?

355
00:19:09.465 --> 00:19:10.715
Like this is where we're at.

356
00:19:11.575 --> 00:19:13.835
You see how far off we can get from this?

357
00:19:13.865 --> 00:19:16.115
Like, like we're setting some standard this way.

358
00:19:16.115 --> 00:19:17.235
That's totally off.

359
00:19:20.105 --> 00:19:21.165
So there should be a measure of

360
00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:22.445
conviction here for some of us.

361
00:19:22.505 --> 00:19:24.125
And I, I say that,

362
00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:25.805
but I also wanna give some encouragement

363
00:19:25.985 --> 00:19:28.125
as I'm processing this myself all week.

364
00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:31.005
There's also a measure of encouragement hopefully here.

365
00:19:32.105 --> 00:19:34.045
If that's you and you're kinda like hoping everybody else

366
00:19:34.045 --> 00:19:36.365
loves God enough and you kind of come with them,

367
00:19:36.505 --> 00:19:40.765
or if you're faking it somehow, listen, that means

368
00:19:42.115 --> 00:19:45.045
there's more on the table for us with God, right?

369
00:19:46.365 --> 00:19:49.105
If we're just kind of half baked going through this thing,

370
00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:51.305
if we're just sort of, kind of skating through

371
00:19:51.305 --> 00:19:54.825
with everybody else and we're faking like we are, there's,

372
00:19:54.825 --> 00:19:57.145
there's an opportunity here for us, each one of us,

373
00:19:57.205 --> 00:20:00.705
to grow deeper, to have more experiential passion

374
00:20:00.735 --> 00:20:02.065
with the Lord than we do.

375
00:20:04.055 --> 00:20:05.505
Like why, why do we settle?

376
00:20:07.045 --> 00:20:11.025
Why do we settle for this sort of surface level churchianity

377
00:20:11.025 --> 00:20:12.265
that we're kind of decent people

378
00:20:12.285 --> 00:20:14.065
and we show up at church whenever it's convenient?

379
00:20:14.215 --> 00:20:18.025
Like why do we settle for that instead of knowing, getting

380
00:20:18.025 --> 00:20:20.865
to know this God who's loved us like he does?

381
00:20:21.005 --> 00:20:23.865
Why do we settle for something less than what he's offering

382
00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:25.385
to every one of us?

383
00:20:30.245 --> 00:20:32.025
And now I realize there are all kinds

384
00:20:32.025 --> 00:20:34.065
of reasons we might feel distant from God

385
00:20:34.065 --> 00:20:35.865
and feel like we kind of have to fake it or whatever it is.

386
00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:39.265
Maybe it's hurt you've felt or doubt or,

387
00:20:39.525 --> 00:20:41.425
or maybe it's the distractions of your phone

388
00:20:41.565 --> 00:20:43.785
and all the things on tv, whatever it is.

389
00:20:44.315 --> 00:20:45.585
Maybe it's even fatigue.

390
00:20:45.585 --> 00:20:47.025
You're just burned out tired

391
00:20:47.105 --> 00:20:49.965
and there's, there's a distance you feel from God.

392
00:20:49.965 --> 00:20:52.645
What do you do with that? And you're like, I,

393
00:20:52.725 --> 00:20:55.805
I wanna love God, but I don't feel like anything right now.

394
00:20:55.835 --> 00:20:58.045
What do you do? You run home to your father,

395
00:21:00.445 --> 00:21:03.015
like you run home to your father who is waiting,

396
00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:05.935
who's got his arms open, he's got the goat prepared.

397
00:21:06.285 --> 00:21:09.615
He's, he's ready. You, you gotta run home like you,

398
00:21:09.615 --> 00:21:11.335
you gotta get rid of distractions.

399
00:21:11.355 --> 00:21:15.175
You gotta refocus. You need to remember the gospel.

400
00:21:16.815 --> 00:21:18.335
Remember who God says you are.

401
00:21:18.515 --> 00:21:19.695
You're not that, you're not

402
00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:20.855
your past, you're not the distraction.

403
00:21:20.855 --> 00:21:22.455
You remember who he says you are.

404
00:21:22.995 --> 00:21:24.935
And that breaks through the walls.

405
00:21:25.195 --> 00:21:27.215
You remember his love breaks through the walls

406
00:21:31.145 --> 00:21:32.565
reprioritizing him.

407
00:21:32.755 --> 00:21:36.485
Have you ever, you ever seen one of those news clips

408
00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:40.005
of someone who was saved from like

409
00:21:40.685 --> 00:21:42.165
a burning car or rubble

410
00:21:42.165 --> 00:21:44.525
or something that, that somebody like a first responder

411
00:21:44.525 --> 00:21:48.445
saved their life Or maybe it was a cardiac arrest

412
00:21:48.465 --> 00:21:51.045
or something and, and the, the person saved their life.

413
00:21:51.155 --> 00:21:53.325
Have you ever seen the video of them meeting

414
00:21:53.325 --> 00:21:54.885
that person a couple months later?

415
00:21:56.345 --> 00:22:00.535
Like, you saved my life. How do they handle that?

416
00:22:00.595 --> 00:22:02.495
Do they go in it like, yeah man, hey, great to meet you.

417
00:22:02.495 --> 00:22:04.455
Good to see you, thanks and move on.

418
00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:09.255
Complete transformation, right? But you've saved my life.

419
00:22:09.305 --> 00:22:10.855
Thank you for pulling me outta that.

420
00:22:11.255 --> 00:22:14.855
I think they're overwhelmed. Can't even hold it together.

421
00:22:14.855 --> 00:22:16.215
Overwhelmed with gratitude.

422
00:22:18.335 --> 00:22:22.355
How much more should we be with the God of the universe

423
00:22:22.775 --> 00:22:24.755
who has saved us eternally

424
00:22:27.365 --> 00:22:30.455
from separation from him forever?

425
00:22:30.755 --> 00:22:31.815
He saved us from that.

426
00:22:32.035 --> 00:22:33.255
Not because we deserved it, but

427
00:22:33.255 --> 00:22:34.855
because he just chose to reach into it

428
00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:38.655
and say, you're mine by grace.

429
00:22:41.195 --> 00:22:43.095
And so again, loving God with all that we are,

430
00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:44.095
that's first priority.

431
00:22:45.105 --> 00:22:48.085
But that's not all that Romans 12 shares about love.

432
00:22:48.085 --> 00:22:49.525
That's just the first two verses.

433
00:22:52.355 --> 00:22:55.455
Listen next to verses three through 13.

434
00:22:59.715 --> 00:23:01.735
For by the grace given to me, I say to everyone

435
00:23:01.735 --> 00:23:02.855
among you not to think

436
00:23:02.855 --> 00:23:04.615
of himself more highly than he ought to think.

437
00:23:05.155 --> 00:23:07.135
But to think with sober judgment, each according

438
00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:09.735
to the measure of faith that God has assigned for,

439
00:23:09.735 --> 00:23:11.295
as in one body, we have many members.

440
00:23:11.715 --> 00:23:13.455
The members do not hold the same function.

441
00:23:14.195 --> 00:23:16.775
So we though many are one body in Christ individually

442
00:23:16.775 --> 00:23:20.015
members, one of another, having gifts that differ according

443
00:23:20.015 --> 00:23:21.295
to the grace given to us.

444
00:23:21.475 --> 00:23:24.655
Let us use them if prophecy proportion of our faith,

445
00:23:24.795 --> 00:23:26.695
if service in our serving, if the one

446
00:23:26.695 --> 00:23:28.455
who teaches in his teaching, the one

447
00:23:28.455 --> 00:23:30.175
who exhorts in his exhortation, the one

448
00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:33.335
who contributes in generosity, the one who leads with zeal,

449
00:23:33.795 --> 00:23:35.935
the one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness,

450
00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:38.795
let love be genuine.

451
00:23:40.595 --> 00:23:43.875
A w***e, hate what is evil. Hold fast to what is good.

452
00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:46.845
Love one another with brotherly affection.

453
00:23:47.495 --> 00:23:48.965
Outdo one another in showing honor.

454
00:23:49.905 --> 00:23:53.245
Do not be slothful in zeal. Be fervent in spirit.

455
00:23:53.415 --> 00:23:57.925
Serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope. Be patient in tribulation.

456
00:23:58.225 --> 00:23:59.285
Be constant in prayer.

457
00:24:00.055 --> 00:24:02.165
Contribute to the needs of the saints

458
00:24:02.225 --> 00:24:04.445
and seek to show hospitality.

459
00:24:07.175 --> 00:24:09.195
Now, we studied part of that last week when we talked

460
00:24:09.195 --> 00:24:10.395
about serving of course.

461
00:24:10.455 --> 00:24:12.435
But verses nine through 13 add a lot

462
00:24:12.435 --> 00:24:13.595
of color to that, don't they?

463
00:24:15.685 --> 00:24:17.955
We're gonna look at each of these facets over the next

464
00:24:17.955 --> 00:24:20.475
couple months a lot more deeply just piece by piece.

465
00:24:20.475 --> 00:24:22.875
But for now, did you see something about this section?

466
00:24:23.335 --> 00:24:25.075
Did you see how others centered?

467
00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:29.695
It was, it was giving your life away.

468
00:24:29.695 --> 00:24:31.655
For others, it was having a deep affection.

469
00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:33.175
For others, it was praying for others,

470
00:24:33.235 --> 00:24:35.535
it was giving to others.

471
00:24:36.115 --> 00:24:40.135
But notice a distinct orientation in this part.

472
00:24:42.275 --> 00:24:45.955
All of that is directed toward the church.

473
00:24:48.005 --> 00:24:49.895
It's all toward the church.

474
00:24:49.965 --> 00:24:52.935
Your gifts used for the church and your lifestyle.

475
00:24:53.875 --> 00:24:57.655
For verse 13, the saints, the church.

476
00:25:00.625 --> 00:25:04.555
There's dozens of similar words in the New Testament.

477
00:25:04.895 --> 00:25:06.315
We call them the one anothers.

478
00:25:06.315 --> 00:25:08.035
Just do a study in your Bible app.

479
00:25:08.355 --> 00:25:09.475
Sometime search one another

480
00:25:09.655 --> 00:25:13.475
and just see the dozens of times Paul commands the church

481
00:25:13.895 --> 00:25:16.835
to do things to one another, like serve one another, care

482
00:25:16.835 --> 00:25:19.355
for one another, speak truth to one another.

483
00:25:19.695 --> 00:25:21.915
All of those things, there's dozens of them here,

484
00:25:22.345 --> 00:25:23.635
love one another.

485
00:25:26.455 --> 00:25:29.075
So again, here's the point. You

486
00:25:29.075 --> 00:25:31.595
and I are to love our brothers

487
00:25:31.595 --> 00:25:34.035
and sisters in the church sacrificially.

488
00:25:35.745 --> 00:25:40.475
When we look at this section three through 13, in response

489
00:25:40.935 --> 00:25:43.115
to God's love for us,

490
00:25:43.545 --> 00:25:45.995
like Christ has loved us.

491
00:25:46.495 --> 00:25:49.755
We are to love our brothers and sisters within the church.

492
00:25:52.825 --> 00:25:54.405
Listen, if you're gonna obey these kind

493
00:25:54.405 --> 00:25:56.085
of commands, can't be selfish.

494
00:25:57.665 --> 00:26:00.845
It can't be about you. It's all about serving others.

495
00:26:00.875 --> 00:26:02.805
It's you're like, okay, great. What does that look like?

496
00:26:03.355 --> 00:26:05.565
Very specific ways here in these verses, right?

497
00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:10.525
How do I love the church better? Look at these verses.

498
00:26:11.315 --> 00:26:15.285
What does he say? If you're gonna compete at something even

499
00:26:15.285 --> 00:26:18.525
more than church softball leagues compete at being the most

500
00:26:18.565 --> 00:26:22.005
honoring to others, outdo each other in it.

501
00:26:22.235 --> 00:26:24.485
Like if we walked around just out trying

502
00:26:24.485 --> 00:26:27.325
to out honor each other, how great would that be?

503
00:26:27.325 --> 00:26:29.485
You'd wanna be there. You'd wanna be a part of that, right?

504
00:26:31.095 --> 00:26:33.555
He also said, don't come in here just as a consumer.

505
00:26:35.105 --> 00:26:38.715
Look for ways to serve your brothers and sisters.

506
00:26:40.905 --> 00:26:44.685
Pray for one another. Like when was the last time you prayed

507
00:26:44.865 --> 00:26:46.885
by name for a fellow Christian

508
00:26:48.705 --> 00:26:50.035
that they would be supported,

509
00:26:50.355 --> 00:26:51.835
encouraged, healed, whatever it is.

510
00:26:51.835 --> 00:26:54.435
When was the last time you prayed for them by name?

511
00:26:55.335 --> 00:26:57.395
He says, pray for one another. That's one way you love.

512
00:26:57.575 --> 00:27:00.935
The church says, we're also

513
00:27:00.935 --> 00:27:03.415
to give financially to support others.

514
00:27:03.595 --> 00:27:06.095
Now, that means of course, directly,

515
00:27:06.115 --> 00:27:09.265
but are you giving anything Like

516
00:27:09.285 --> 00:27:10.665
so brother and sister has a need?

517
00:27:10.665 --> 00:27:11.985
You say, Hey, here's, here's money.

518
00:27:11.985 --> 00:27:13.785
Here's a resource, here's a something

519
00:27:14.055 --> 00:27:15.065
that I can help you with.

520
00:27:15.845 --> 00:27:17.385
Are you giving financially through the church?

521
00:27:17.385 --> 00:27:19.585
Because not only do we keep lights on

522
00:27:19.585 --> 00:27:22.465
and do ministry, those kind of things, benevolence,

523
00:27:23.175 --> 00:27:25.025
there's members of need you don't even know about.

524
00:27:25.125 --> 00:27:27.465
You can give to this fund that we use to provide.

525
00:27:27.465 --> 00:27:28.945
There's disaster relief.

526
00:27:28.945 --> 00:27:30.785
That part of what you give goes to support

527
00:27:31.675 --> 00:27:33.065
towns ravaged by tornadoes.

528
00:27:33.905 --> 00:27:35.065
Brothers and sisters in need.

529
00:27:35.065 --> 00:27:38.905
There we can give to brothers and sisters in need.

530
00:27:41.715 --> 00:27:43.255
But that's again the realignment process.

531
00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:47.495
Jesus came not to be served but to serve. Remember that.

532
00:27:49.825 --> 00:27:54.405
And so the more we pursue him, the more we will all look

533
00:27:54.585 --> 00:27:56.485
for ways to love

534
00:27:56.545 --> 00:28:00.085
and serve other people we'll clamor for it.

535
00:28:00.085 --> 00:28:03.125
We'll look for it and search for ways to love that.

536
00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:05.725
That's just gonna be part of who we are to love others.

537
00:28:06.195 --> 00:28:08.045
Well, and here's why this is so important.

538
00:28:08.245 --> 00:28:11.205
I know it seems like we're harping on it a lot, but,

539
00:28:11.205 --> 00:28:13.005
but this is why it's so critical.

540
00:28:14.615 --> 00:28:18.205
Jesus said, John 1335, by this,

541
00:28:19.145 --> 00:28:21.325
all people will know that you are my disciples.

542
00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:26.555
If you have love for one another, Like this is missional,

543
00:28:27.785 --> 00:28:30.275
this is, this is reputation in the world.

544
00:28:31.385 --> 00:28:32.675
What are they seeing from us?

545
00:28:33.575 --> 00:28:34.955
Do they even know we're Christians?

546
00:28:35.735 --> 00:28:37.155
How are we gonna, how are they gonna know

547
00:28:38.905 --> 00:28:41.205
how we love one another?

548
00:28:43.485 --> 00:28:46.175
That means we don't just have similar affinities.

549
00:28:46.445 --> 00:28:48.415
That means we don't just have a general

550
00:28:48.525 --> 00:28:49.615
affection for one another.

551
00:28:49.615 --> 00:28:51.615
That means we don't just have a lack of conflict.

552
00:28:51.875 --> 00:28:55.815
It means we are genuinely sacrificing

553
00:28:56.395 --> 00:28:57.495
for one another.

554
00:28:58.715 --> 00:29:03.535
That's love. How can you

555
00:29:03.535 --> 00:29:08.495
better love the fellow members of the church in real ways?

556
00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:15.625
You might have noticed though that Romans 12 continues.

557
00:29:15.865 --> 00:29:17.385
There's still some left, right?

558
00:29:20.375 --> 00:29:23.875
So again, the lens of love, God's love for us.

559
00:29:24.165 --> 00:29:28.275
First, look now at verses 14 through 21.

560
00:29:31.865 --> 00:29:35.455
Bless those who persecute you. Bless and do not curse them.

561
00:29:36.535 --> 00:29:39.255
Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.

562
00:29:39.605 --> 00:29:41.205
Live in harmony with one another.

563
00:29:41.545 --> 00:29:45.085
Do not be haughty or prideful, but associate with the lowly.

564
00:29:46.055 --> 00:29:50.525
Never be wise in your own sight. Repay no one evil for evil.

565
00:29:50.785 --> 00:29:52.685
But give thought to do what is honorable in the sight

566
00:29:52.685 --> 00:29:54.365
of all if possible.

567
00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:56.725
So far as it depends on you live peaceably with all.

568
00:29:57.435 --> 00:29:59.125
Beloved, never avenge yourselves,

569
00:29:59.385 --> 00:30:01.125
but leave it to the wrath of God.

570
00:30:01.785 --> 00:30:03.565
For it is written. Vengeance is mine.

571
00:30:03.845 --> 00:30:05.285
I will repay, says the Lord.

572
00:30:06.475 --> 00:30:08.935
To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.

573
00:30:09.555 --> 00:30:12.215
If he's thirsty, give him something to drink for.

574
00:30:12.235 --> 00:30:14.815
By so doing, you'll heap burning coals on his head.

575
00:30:16.235 --> 00:30:20.735
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

576
00:30:24.215 --> 00:30:27.875
Did you notice a shift of the orientation

577
00:30:27.895 --> 00:30:30.355
of this passage, right?

578
00:30:30.505 --> 00:30:33.155
Just before this, Paul was focused on

579
00:30:34.065 --> 00:30:35.595
relationships within the church.

580
00:30:37.095 --> 00:30:39.435
But here, right outta the gate, bless those

581
00:30:39.495 --> 00:30:40.595
who persecute you.

582
00:30:41.285 --> 00:30:42.595
Bless and do not curse them.

583
00:30:42.665 --> 00:30:44.235
He's talking about relationships.

584
00:30:44.255 --> 00:30:47.875
Now he's, he's widening the the lens of love,

585
00:30:48.135 --> 00:30:49.835
to not just be people who you agree

586
00:30:49.835 --> 00:30:50.875
with and who agree with you.

587
00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:52.795
But now he's saying, Hey, look, this is bigger than that.

588
00:30:52.895 --> 00:30:56.075
You love more those outside.

589
00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:58.905
He's talking about unbelievers.

590
00:31:00.735 --> 00:31:01.915
So again, we're gonna look at each one

591
00:31:01.915 --> 00:31:03.435
of these points over the next couple months.

592
00:31:03.575 --> 00:31:07.245
But the point here today is that

593
00:31:07.245 --> 00:31:11.695
because of God's love for you, you are

594
00:31:11.695 --> 00:31:13.695
to love your enemies radically.

595
00:31:16.815 --> 00:31:21.435
That's his point here. You love God wholeheartedly.

596
00:31:21.435 --> 00:31:23.115
You love your brothers and sisters within the church

597
00:31:23.475 --> 00:31:26.955
sacrificially and you love your enemies radically, all

598
00:31:26.955 --> 00:31:28.195
because of God's love for you.

599
00:31:32.435 --> 00:31:35.155
I mean, just think about what Jesus said in Matthew five.

600
00:31:35.155 --> 00:31:37.395
This is the most famous sermon in history.

601
00:31:40.335 --> 00:31:41.955
But what Jesus was doing with it

602
00:31:43.815 --> 00:31:47.035
was he was resetting the vertical standard, right?

603
00:31:47.055 --> 00:31:48.715
The whole sermon is Jesus saying,

604
00:31:48.715 --> 00:31:50.315
this is actually what I'm about.

605
00:31:50.345 --> 00:31:52.035
This is what Christianity faith

606
00:31:52.305 --> 00:31:53.715
following the Lord is all about.

607
00:31:53.725 --> 00:31:54.755
Watch what he says here.

608
00:31:59.145 --> 00:32:02.085
You've heard it was said, an eye for an eye, a tooth

609
00:32:02.105 --> 00:32:03.165
for a tooth revenge.

610
00:32:04.145 --> 00:32:06.605
But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil.

611
00:32:07.105 --> 00:32:09.365
But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him.

612
00:32:09.365 --> 00:32:12.325
The other. Also, if anyone would sue you

613
00:32:12.345 --> 00:32:14.125
and take your tunic, your outside garment,

614
00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:15.525
let him have your cloak as well.

615
00:32:16.025 --> 00:32:19.085
If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.

616
00:32:19.475 --> 00:32:20.805
Give to the one who begs from you.

617
00:32:20.945 --> 00:32:23.245
Do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.

618
00:32:24.825 --> 00:32:27.085
You've heard that it was said, you shall love your neighbor

619
00:32:27.085 --> 00:32:28.325
and hate your enemy.

620
00:32:28.745 --> 00:32:31.405
But I say to you, love your enemies

621
00:32:31.545 --> 00:32:35.285
and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be sons

622
00:32:35.285 --> 00:32:36.645
of your father who is in heaven,

623
00:32:36.945 --> 00:32:38.565
for he makes his sunrise on the evil,

624
00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:42.365
on the good sends rain on the just and on the unjust.

625
00:32:44.475 --> 00:32:47.045
Like, like. Doesn't that sound so radical to us?

626
00:32:49.075 --> 00:32:50.205
Like in, in a world

627
00:32:52.665 --> 00:32:56.925
that's focused on vengeance and selfish ambition

628
00:32:57.225 --> 00:32:58.725
and taking of what's mine?

629
00:32:59.435 --> 00:33:02.445
Jesus's words stand out like a lighthouse

630
00:33:02.505 --> 00:33:03.605
in a very dark world.

631
00:33:05.485 --> 00:33:09.455
Like he says things that sound so crazy.

632
00:33:09.995 --> 00:33:13.255
But I'm really glad he gave us the reason he said it,

633
00:33:15.385 --> 00:33:16.595
because he continued

634
00:33:16.675 --> 00:33:19.595
and he said this, for, if you love those who love you,

635
00:33:19.625 --> 00:33:20.755
what reward do you have?

636
00:33:21.495 --> 00:33:23.235
Do not even the tax collectors do the same.

637
00:33:24.095 --> 00:33:25.635
And if you greet only your brothers,

638
00:33:25.785 --> 00:33:27.355
what more are you doing than others?

639
00:33:28.095 --> 00:33:30.035
Do not even the gentiles do the

640
00:33:30.035 --> 00:33:33.715
same, right?

641
00:33:33.715 --> 00:33:35.115
What he's saying is this is the kinda love

642
00:33:35.115 --> 00:33:36.195
that's gonna stand out.

643
00:33:36.935 --> 00:33:38.795
It doesn't take anything different for you

644
00:33:38.795 --> 00:33:40.075
to love somebody who loves you, right?

645
00:33:40.775 --> 00:33:41.915
An unbeliever can do that.

646
00:33:41.985 --> 00:33:44.635
Anybody in the world doesn't matter if, if you're loved,

647
00:33:44.815 --> 00:33:46.235
you can love them back so easily.

648
00:33:46.615 --> 00:33:48.555
It takes a whole lot of transformation though,

649
00:33:48.975 --> 00:33:52.285
to love someone who hates you, Who hurts you.

650
00:33:53.675 --> 00:33:56.575
That's what he's saying is there's a transformation I'm

651
00:33:56.575 --> 00:33:59.215
doing in you that's enabling you

652
00:33:59.595 --> 00:34:01.895
to love even your enemies.

653
00:34:01.895 --> 00:34:04.775
Because remember, who initiated all this God did

654
00:34:05.035 --> 00:34:07.695
by loving us as his enemies.

655
00:34:11.805 --> 00:34:14.305
And so that's the question we have to wrestle with is like,

656
00:34:14.305 --> 00:34:16.745
all right, what does that mean to, to love my enemies?

657
00:34:16.785 --> 00:34:18.705
I, I know I'm supposed to. What does that even look like?

658
00:34:18.705 --> 00:34:20.465
Because I don't have tunics and cloaks.

659
00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.105
I'm not asking people to walk a mile.

660
00:34:22.105 --> 00:34:23.705
Like what does, what does this look like today?

661
00:34:23.705 --> 00:34:25.105
It's a different world. What do we do with that?

662
00:34:26.655 --> 00:34:27.905
Just give you a couple examples.

663
00:34:30.295 --> 00:34:34.585
This means that instead of cursing people that you disagree

664
00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:37.265
with on social media, you instead bless them.

665
00:34:42.155 --> 00:34:45.295
It means when your agnostic coworker gets a promotion over

666
00:34:45.315 --> 00:34:46.735
you, you celebrate with them.

667
00:34:49.975 --> 00:34:53.275
Or when your Hindu neighbor, his dad dies,

668
00:34:53.295 --> 00:34:54.315
you grieve with him.

669
00:34:59.025 --> 00:35:02.645
It means you walk humbly in the world,

670
00:35:03.545 --> 00:35:06.605
not trying to position yourself with the most popular

671
00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:09.965
or most wealthy people, but instead you are able

672
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:12.325
and willing to care for the least

673
00:35:12.345 --> 00:35:13.845
of these in real hidden ways.

674
00:35:18.585 --> 00:35:20.525
It means you live honorably with integrity

675
00:35:21.065 --> 00:35:23.045
and you as best you can seek

676
00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:24.845
to make your life match your words.

677
00:35:24.905 --> 00:35:26.925
And when it doesn't match up, you own it

678
00:35:26.945 --> 00:35:28.085
and you repent of it.

679
00:35:31.805 --> 00:35:33.505
It means when you are hurt,

680
00:35:35.495 --> 00:35:39.085
you let God take the vengeance, not you.

681
00:35:41.595 --> 00:35:43.545
Which by the way, he's way better at,

682
00:35:43.645 --> 00:35:44.945
way better at it than we are.

683
00:35:45.085 --> 00:35:46.145
So why do we even try?

684
00:35:48.655 --> 00:35:51.835
Let him do it in the right way as he sees fit?

685
00:35:54.755 --> 00:35:57.395
I just love the last verse here in Romans 12 verse 21.

686
00:35:57.395 --> 00:36:00.635
It says, do not be overcome by evil

687
00:36:01.095 --> 00:36:03.915
but overcome evil with good.

688
00:36:05.695 --> 00:36:07.465
Like what if we lived our lives like that?

689
00:36:08.815 --> 00:36:12.185
What if we looked for every way to overcome evil?

690
00:36:12.525 --> 00:36:15.465
Not by using snarky comments or boycotts,

691
00:36:15.525 --> 00:36:18.345
but by doing good over and above what they've done

692
00:36:19.365 --> 00:36:22.865
and just overwhelming the world with good instead

693
00:36:22.925 --> 00:36:24.865
of the evil it experiences.

694
00:36:24.925 --> 00:36:26.825
How much different would the world be if we did that?

695
00:36:28.125 --> 00:36:30.785
How much different would we be if we live like that?

696
00:36:34.165 --> 00:36:35.905
And so love God wholeheartedly.

697
00:36:36.175 --> 00:36:38.545
Love the brothers and sisters sacrificially.

698
00:36:38.815 --> 00:36:40.945
Love your enemies radically.

699
00:36:41.085 --> 00:36:44.505
But we cannot forget church like I could. I could say that.

700
00:36:44.605 --> 00:36:46.785
And we walk outta here, all kind of discouraged,

701
00:36:46.925 --> 00:36:48.065
all kind of beat up a little bit.

702
00:36:48.185 --> 00:36:49.265
'cause we know we don't do that very well.

703
00:36:49.445 --> 00:36:51.145
So let's not forget where we began.

704
00:36:54.795 --> 00:36:57.675
Remember, it's not about how much better you can love.

705
00:36:57.985 --> 00:37:00.275
It's not about how much more you can love them.

706
00:37:00.815 --> 00:37:03.715
Our foundation is God's great love

707
00:37:03.735 --> 00:37:06.675
for us in Jesus's death and resurrection.

708
00:37:07.495 --> 00:37:10.555
That's the standard. Even we were his enemies.

709
00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:14.315
He loved us in that specific way so that we could know him.

710
00:37:14.415 --> 00:37:15.595
That's what he did.

711
00:37:15.685 --> 00:37:16.795
Don't forget that

712
00:37:16.815 --> 00:37:19.875
before you ever loved God, he loved you first

713
00:37:20.855 --> 00:37:22.515
before you could ever serve God.

714
00:37:22.775 --> 00:37:25.715
He served you first before you could ever forgive

715
00:37:25.715 --> 00:37:26.835
or love your enemy.

716
00:37:27.015 --> 00:37:29.835
He forgave and love you as his enemy.

717
00:37:30.965 --> 00:37:32.155
Don't forget that

718
00:37:34.155 --> 00:37:38.565
because that's what then compels us to love God with all

719
00:37:38.565 --> 00:37:40.525
of our hearts, to love our brothers

720
00:37:40.525 --> 00:37:42.405
and sisters in sacrificial ways,

721
00:37:42.585 --> 00:37:44.485
to love our enemies in radical ways

722
00:37:44.485 --> 00:37:45.525
that stand out in the world.

723
00:37:45.585 --> 00:37:49.045
That's what compels us. It's God's love for us.

724
00:37:53.495 --> 00:37:55.835
You might have heard the name Frederick Douglass

725
00:37:56.055 --> 00:37:59.495
before he was an author of course,

726
00:37:59.555 --> 00:38:03.535
but he primarily was known for his tireless efforts

727
00:38:03.595 --> 00:38:06.055
to abolish the slave trade in

728
00:38:06.055 --> 00:38:07.335
America in the late 18 hundreds.

729
00:38:09.695 --> 00:38:10.795
He was born into slavery.

730
00:38:10.895 --> 00:38:15.285
He experienced the evils firsthand

731
00:38:17.375 --> 00:38:18.795
of human cruelty.

732
00:38:20.775 --> 00:38:25.475
But what he wrote was that primarily his passion for

733
00:38:25.475 --> 00:38:29.115
what he was working towards came from his faith.

734
00:38:31.665 --> 00:38:36.285
That he understood God's profound

735
00:38:36.595 --> 00:38:38.045
love for humanity

736
00:38:38.825 --> 00:38:42.525
and that ignited in him a passion for justice

737
00:38:42.905 --> 00:38:44.045
and equality in the world.

738
00:38:46.245 --> 00:38:50.545
See, God had transformed his life by his love,

739
00:38:50.595 --> 00:38:53.705
which led him to love God without fear of what

740
00:38:53.945 --> 00:38:54.985
that might lead him into,

741
00:38:55.325 --> 00:39:00.185
but also to work diligently, to change society

742
00:39:00.415 --> 00:39:01.785
that he saw was wrong.

743
00:39:05.285 --> 00:39:07.145
Is God's love that compelling to you?

744
00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:12.865
Let's reflect on that together now.

745
00:39:13.095 --> 00:39:15.785
Just bow your heads with me if you would,

746
00:39:20.245 --> 00:39:22.745
and let's just stop again and abide

747
00:39:23.005 --> 00:39:25.665
and rest in God's love for us.

748
00:39:28.335 --> 00:39:33.145
Said it dozens of times today. We say it every week.

749
00:39:33.285 --> 00:39:36.625
You know even the words, but, but just stop

750
00:39:37.245 --> 00:39:40.905
and listen to what God is saying to your heart right now.

751
00:39:43.205 --> 00:39:47.745
You feel too far gone. You feel cold, you feel numb.

752
00:39:48.295 --> 00:39:49.545
Just stop.

753
00:39:50.935 --> 00:39:53.665
Hear me, hear God's word

754
00:39:55.885 --> 00:39:57.105
in this is love.

755
00:39:58.885 --> 00:39:59.945
Not that we've loved God,

756
00:40:00.125 --> 00:40:04.865
but that God sent his son to be the payment

757
00:40:05.765 --> 00:40:08.065
to cover your sin.

758
00:40:09.365 --> 00:40:10.305
That's love,

759
00:40:14.485 --> 00:40:17.385
to make you a part of his family.

760
00:40:20.325 --> 00:40:24.585
That's love. Rest in that today.

761
00:40:28.585 --> 00:40:30.985
Remember what he's done. Remember who he is.

762
00:40:31.415 --> 00:40:32.785
Rest in that today.

763
00:40:38.125 --> 00:40:41.505
And of course, you and I have not loved him wholeheartedly.

764
00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:43.985
We have not loved our brothers and sisters sacrificially.

765
00:40:44.045 --> 00:40:46.265
We have not loved our enemies radically.

766
00:40:46.265 --> 00:40:47.305
We don't do that perfectly.

767
00:40:47.405 --> 00:40:48.465
Of course, we don't

768
00:40:53.445 --> 00:40:57.825
Let his love compel us towards those things.

769
00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:05.385
Like verse one and two, God, I'm on the altar. Say this.

770
00:41:05.385 --> 00:41:07.425
Maybe pray this to, to him in your own words.

771
00:41:07.485 --> 00:41:11.265
But God, I, I want I, I'm on the altar,

772
00:41:13.365 --> 00:41:14.745
living sacrifice.

773
00:41:14.845 --> 00:41:16.905
God, don't let me crawl back off the altar

774
00:41:20.135 --> 00:41:22.145
that I would die to myself

775
00:41:22.735 --> 00:41:25.145
because you have given me everything.

776
00:41:25.525 --> 00:41:28.225
And, and in your death, Jesus, I have died.

777
00:41:28.445 --> 00:41:33.025
And so I can now live through you, for you, for others

778
00:41:36.185 --> 00:41:40.765
and just ask him to help you how to love him better to

779
00:41:40.905 --> 00:41:42.605
to long to be with Him more.

780
00:41:42.825 --> 00:41:46.005
Ask him for that. He would stir your affection for him.

781
00:41:46.005 --> 00:41:48.645
Maybe it's cold and you're numb. That's okay.

782
00:41:50.955 --> 00:41:52.405
There's more on the table for you.

783
00:41:56.265 --> 00:41:57.605
Run to him. Run to your father.

784
00:42:01.705 --> 00:42:04.085
Ask him how you can love brothers and sisters in the church.

785
00:42:04.085 --> 00:42:07.205
Better ask him how you can love your enemies more radically

786
00:42:07.205 --> 00:42:08.205
than the world would see.

787
00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:09.605
And know that something's happened

788
00:42:09.605 --> 00:42:10.685
in your heart differently.

789
00:42:11.315 --> 00:42:14.445
Something's changed. Ask him to give you the power

790
00:42:15.145 --> 00:42:16.645
by his spirit to do that.

791
00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:23.205
All he's asking of you is just to open your life,

792
00:42:23.205 --> 00:42:24.645
open your hands and say, God, I'm all yours

793
00:42:25.995 --> 00:42:28.005
because of your great love for me.

794
00:42:28.325 --> 00:42:31.805
I believe you are the only way. And so my life is yours.

795
00:42:41.145 --> 00:42:44.085
In a moment, we're gonna sing a song

796
00:42:44.085 --> 00:42:45.245
that's probably new to most of you.

797
00:42:46.215 --> 00:42:49.235
Our students have been singing it for a few months

798
00:42:50.655 --> 00:42:51.955
and it's simple,

799
00:42:54.415 --> 00:42:59.035
but it's a declaration of what we hope

800
00:42:59.855 --> 00:43:03.675
to be able to say 100% in our hearts.

801
00:43:05.745 --> 00:43:08.595
It's true. In part it's true here and there, up and down.

802
00:43:09.335 --> 00:43:10.355
But, but let this be.

803
00:43:10.355 --> 00:43:11.715
Maybe you can't even sing it

804
00:43:11.735 --> 00:43:13.675
yet 'cause it's not true of your heart.

805
00:43:13.675 --> 00:43:16.955
That's okay. Ask God to make it true of you.

806
00:43:18.025 --> 00:43:21.475
Make it true of your heart. All of me, for all of you, God.

807
00:43:23.135 --> 00:43:25.355
So if you're able, let's stand together, sing.
