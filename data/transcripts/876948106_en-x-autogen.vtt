00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.800
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.560
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

3
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.840
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth

4
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.680
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

5
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.240
When Christ who is your life appears, then you will also appear with him. And,

6
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.200
Well, happy Sunday Church, uh, grace and peace to you from God,

7
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.040
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. After last Sunday, great Sunday,

8
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.680
celebrating what God has done in Nicaragua. Uh,

9
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.680
we get to be back today into this series through the book of Colossians that we

10
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.440
call Christ Above All How He's above all,

11
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.040
like we just sang powers and dominions and philosophies and everything else in

12
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.760
this world. He is above it. As we get into it today though,

13
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.720
I want to tell you about the last time that our family went to the circus. Uh,

14
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.080
you'll see why it was the last time here in a second. Um,

15
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.920
the lion Tamer had, uh, you know, the big cage they put out there,

16
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.200
the lion tamer had about six big cats in there with him. And, and you know,

17
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.560
he's teaching 'em how to do the tricks.

18
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.920
They sit on the platform and stand up and all those kind of things.

19
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.960
All because they know that he's gonna give them a bite of food whenever they do

20
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.680
whatever he asks them to do. Well, on this particular occasion this night, uh,

21
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.480
there was one tiger that when they led it into the cage with all the others,

22
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.680
you could tell he was pretty feisty, uh, that night specifically, at least.

23
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.840
And, and so he gets in there and as the man, you have to remember,

24
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.560
like as the man is teaching them or training them or asking them to do the

25
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.560
things, he's giving them a piece of food. But he's also got this really long,

26
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.440
thin stick kind of thing that if they don't do it immediately,

27
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.800
he'll smack 'em on the head or on the side to, to remind them, Hey,

28
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.800
you need to do this. Right? And,

29
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.000
and so on this particular occasion that feisty tiger,

30
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.560
he was asking him to do something and he hit him on the head with that thing and

31
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.080
that tiger came at him and the way the man responded,

32
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.570
you knew that was not supposed to happen that way. And,

33
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.730
and so he thankfully did not go all the way to what he could have done,

34
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.650
but it was clearly a frightening situation for that man.

35
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.310
Now, here's the funny part about this.

36
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.350
We're standing or sitting there with all these people around us,

37
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.830
and everyone was shocked that that was happening.

38
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.040
But think about it like that's a wild animal, right?

39
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.180
That that's, that's a wild animal. Not just fluffy on the couch at home,

40
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.340
the house cat that's fat and lazy. You know, like I can't do anything to you.

41
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.660
This is a wild animal that's a 600 pound machine that is

42
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.010
wired to kill things. And by the way, he's hungry in that moment, right?

43
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.080
We were shocked. People were shocked. Should we be,

44
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.540
listen, I think that's how many of us treat our sin.

45
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.993
We

46
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.810
treat sin like they treat this tiger where

47
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.650
we try to manage it, tame it,

48
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.830
try to keep it in its place so it doesn't do too much damage to us.

49
00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.570
Listen, no, you can't. You shouldn't,

50
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.760
you should take that lion of indwelling sin inside you

51
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.910
and you should drag it out in the street and shoot it in the head, right?

52
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.100
That's what we need to do with it. Not try to manage it, tame it, keep it,

53
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.740
we need to kill it. In fact, John Owen said this a couple hundred years ago,

54
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.660
he said, be killing sin or sin will be killing you.

55
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.270
We, in other words, like if we don't see sin as dangerous,

56
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.420
if we try to manage it, if we try to keep it in its place,

57
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.230
it's going to destroy us.

58
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.160
We have to be ruthless with,

59
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.440
it's what we're gonna see today, in fact, in God's word. So turn two,

60
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.920
Colossians chapter three with me, verses five through 11 is where we'll be.

61
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.000
If you're not there already, don't know how to get to it, that's fine.

62
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.920
Colossians in the New Testament after long books of Romans one, two Corinthians,

63
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.960
Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians. Uh,

64
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.120
chapter three is big number three under that.

65
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.600
And then verse five would be little number five underneath the three.

66
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.360
That's Colossians three, five, and we'll get to that whole section soon enough.

67
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.040
But initially, I want you just to see the first four words of verse five.

68
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.160
In my translation, at least, it may be the same in yours.

69
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.760
It'll be some variation of this, but it includes a big transitional word.

70
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.680
We look for these, right?

71
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.920
We wanna see how the structure of a book fits together.

72
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.390
But these are the first four words of verse five put to death.

73
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.090
Therefore, in other words,

74
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.140
the Colossians were to put to death everything that

75
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.060
we're about to see in verses five through 11. We, we've already said,

76
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.140
put to death your sin.

77
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.060
They were to put it to death because of

78
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.400
everything that's just come before. That's the word. Therefore,

79
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.880
it links us back to what was said.

80
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.720
So because of everything he said in chapters one, two,

81
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.680
in the first part of three, because of all that, put your sin to death.

82
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.420
So what was all that stuff? Well, you might summarize it with this. He,

83
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.513
he says,

84
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.540
put to death all that I'm about to tell you because you need to

85
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.780
remember where you've come from.

86
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.970
Remember where you've come from. That's chapters one and two.

87
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.730
In the first part of three, this is the story of what God has done. They,

88
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.490
they've seen this remembrance been put in front of them. Paul said, Hey here,

89
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.170
here's what God's done. Here's what God's done.

90
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.090
Remember these things then because of all of that,

91
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.833
here's what you do.

92
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.490
And so I wanna take you on just a really rapid fire journey through those first

93
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.050
two chapters. And the first part of chapter three,

94
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.970
what we've seen so far that Paul was reminding them about six things

95
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.770
that you can pull out. There's probably more, but,

96
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.890
but pull six things out to say. Here's what he wanted them to remember.

97
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.070
And first you go back to chapter one, verse 12. He's reminding them that the,

98
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.390
the Colossians felt disqualified by others, but in fact,

99
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.270
God the Father had actually qualified them.

100
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.510
God the Father had taken these people who were disqualified by these judaizers

101
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.510
who were putting all this extra stuff on the gospel saying, Hey,

102
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.350
you've gotta do this. You can't do that. You need to do these things.

103
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.110
And if you don't live as stringent of a lifestyle as we do, you're out.

104
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.710
And they felt disqualified from the gospel by that

105
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.550
action. But no, he says, remember, the Father has qualified you.

106
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.830
He's accepted you. He's made you worthy to be brought in.

107
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.190
He's given you the entry ticket into the church.

108
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.170
And so God says, don't think about disqualification anymore.

109
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.930
Your qualification is not based on you anyway.

110
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.410
Your qualification's based on how Christ lived and it was perfect

111
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.210
for you. That's what qualifies you. So remember,

112
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.730
disqualified now qualified

113
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.510
second in chapter one, verses 21 and 22,

114
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.390
Paul reminded them that they were alienated,

115
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:25.340
but now they're reconciled that these Colossians predominantly were

116
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.420
Gentiles, they were foreigners.

117
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:32.620
They were alienated from the covenant promises that God gave the Jews.

118
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.700
But now they've been reconciled. And look how it says it. Colossians 1 21,

119
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.580
you who once were alienated and hostile in mind doing evil deeds,

120
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.900
he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death in

121
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.580
order to present you holy and blameless and above reproached before him, right?

122
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.440
So it was Christ's death who brought them

123
00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.960
into the family. They'd been excluded. Outcast. Second class, no,

124
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.520
you're in, you're in.

125
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.600
You're reconciled with God through his death on the cross,

126
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.980
the whole book of Ephesians,

127
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.100
the second half of it talks about how God takes that together and,

128
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.420
and makes what was once separated in chapter two,

129
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.900
that God unified in the church in chapter three.

130
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.860
Then verses four through six says how this,

131
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.820
how it plays out because God's made the two, the enemies,

132
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.750
the alienate, alienated ones. Now one. That's what he's talking about here.

133
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.910
Because their identification into this new body is not based on where they were

134
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.950
born or their ethnicity.

135
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.150
Their identification with Christ is what the key is here,

136
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.643
nothing else.

137
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.790
Chapter two then leads us to see that if they identified with Christ's death,

138
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.790
which is what reconciled them, they identify with his death,

139
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.260
then they can also rec, uh, identify with his resurrection death.

140
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.140
'cause Christ didn't stay dead. He rose.

141
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.220
And so they can identify with that resurrection as well,

142
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.100
which means that they were once dead in their sin, but now they're alive in Him

143
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.130
Once dead. Now alive. This is another thing to remember.

144
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.290
Don't forget you were dead in your sin. Now you are alive in Christ.

145
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.610
That's what Colossians two verses 12 and 13 says,

146
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.920
in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of

147
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.040
God who raised him from the dead. You who were dead in your trespasses,

148
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.120
uncircumcision of your flesh,

149
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.160
God made alive together with him having forgiven us all our trespasses.

150
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.290
Right? So dead people can't do much right? Yet.

151
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.770
That's where each one of us is spiritually before Christ.

152
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.650
That's where we all are because of our sin, unable to respond to him.

153
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.170
And we certainly can't bring ourselves back to life.

154
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.330
We needed someone else to do it.

155
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.570
We can't work our way outta that problem of death. We needed God who does this,

156
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.690
by definition, brings things to life. We needed him to bring us to life.

157
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.040
And he does through his resurrection.

158
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.040
In verse 13, you saw it that that prior to Christ,

159
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.840
we actually stand guilty before God because of our sin. But now forgiven,

160
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.880
guilty, now forgiven.

161
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.950
You're forgiven Christian. And and notice that's not just swept under the rug.

162
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.350
Under the rug. Remember right? This is paid for.

163
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:40.590
The concept of forgiveness is that it was paid for not just kind of

164
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.610
swept aside and remember how God forgave us. Chapter two,

165
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.610
verse 14. By canceling the record of debt,

166
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.530
the guilt that stood against us with its legal demands,

167
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:57.520
this he set aside, nailing it to the cross.

168
00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.800
You remember this illustration I gave of,

169
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.320
of the reams of paper that hold your rap sheet,

170
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.120
all the sin you've ever done, all the sin you'll ever do,

171
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.240
stacked up sheet after sheet of paper that was nailed

172
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.880
to the cross where Jesus' hands held the nail,

173
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.900
it went through that rap sheet on the cross just as much nailed to the cross,

174
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.430
canceled the record of debt that stood against you. Guilty,

175
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.010
yes, you're guilty now forgiven through

176
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.583
the cross.

177
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.080
Paul even talked further about how those Colossians were then also free from the

178
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.020
law. They're free from sin, but they're free from the law.

179
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.110
Remember the end of chapter two, he talked about manmade rules, regulations,

180
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.030
don't do this, do this, don't handle that. Don't taste that. Don't touch that.

181
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.950
He's talking about these extra rules. People put on the gospel to say,

182
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.550
you've gotta do this to prove it.

183
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.230
You've gotta do this to ensure that you're a Christian.

184
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.590
You have to do all these things on top of belief

185
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.140
in Christ. You're free.

186
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.580
Because remember what he says there is that enslaves you again,

187
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.000
you are a slave to sin. You are a slave to the law that you have to do this,

188
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.200
but now you don't. Now you're not a slave to it. You're free from it.

189
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.280
You're free from your sin. You're free from the law to follow Christ,

190
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:32.490
free to follow him. Now, where before you were a slave to sin,

191
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.730
you were enslaved, but now you're free.

192
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.050
And then finally, last week or last time we saw in Colossians three,

193
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.883
one through four,

194
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.700
this idea of how the Colossians used to be before Christ.

195
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.340
They were exclusively here on earth. Everything about their minds,

196
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.940
everything about their actions, it was all sinful, all worldly, all earthly.

197
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.660
He says, no, actually in Christ, you're not below anymore. You're now above.

198
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.610
You're above in Him. You're above with him.

199
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.850
You've been raised with Christ.

200
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.610
You are in God at the right hand of the Father.

201
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.770
So that's where their minds ought to be because that's where they are

202
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.350
already. In a sense, they're, they're above,

203
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:25.690
not below anymore. And so again,

204
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.550
the therefore in verse five, I know it was rapid fire,

205
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.110
there's more to look into that. Go back and listen to all the,

206
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.710
I wanna go back and read the first couple chapters,

207
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:39.550
but the therefore in verse five points us back to all of that,

208
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.070
those six things, those six remembrances that Paul says,

209
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.270
don't forget this. And he says in verse five, therefore,

210
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.770
so it pointed the Colossians back to all of that as the source of the

211
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.730
way they can now live this life that he says next. Therefore,

212
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.610
because of who God is, because of all that, God's done.

213
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.450
Because he's coming back one day in verse four. Therefore

214
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.610
do what he is about to say.

215
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.810
And so what does he say before verses uh,

216
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.170
verse one of verse 10 of chapter one. He says,

217
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.890
walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him.

218
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.690
This is how you can verse six of chapter two,

219
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.930
walk in him as we have received him. He's saying, this is how you can do that,

220
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.000
by not forgetting everything that God has done.

221
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.080
And so what we hit now in chapter three,

222
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.870
verse five is this shift to how that new life plays out.

223
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.310
Right? So this has been the background, the basis, the source.

224
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.310
Now how does that life actually look?

225
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.030
'cause it's one thing to believe, it's one thing to,

226
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.830
to kind of understand the gospel in some form. Like you,

227
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.150
you get the concepts,

228
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.930
but it actually does something in your life.

229
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.750
You can't divorce the action, the the result from the belief.

230
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.040
That's what Paul's about to show us.

231
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.870
The rest of the next few weeks will show us what a new life looks like.

232
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.990
If you're qualified, if you're reconciled, if you're alive, if you're forgiven,

233
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.270
if you're above, then this is what you do now.

234
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.390
This is how you live now because that's true of you in

235
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.350
Christ. Starting with verse five of chapter three,

236
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:36.370
therefore put to death what is earthly in you.

237
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:41.530
Sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire,

238
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.770
covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these,

239
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.900
the wrath of God is coming. And these,

240
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.140
you too once walked when you were living in them.

241
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.140
But now you must put them all away. Anger, wrath, malice,

242
00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.870
slander, obscene. Talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another.

243
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.100
Seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the

244
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.140
new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.

245
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.360
Here. There's not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian,

246
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.840
scythian, slave free. Christ is all. And in all

247
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.960
God, we've seen a lot already in the last few minutes,

248
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.750
been reminded of these truths of who you are and what you've done.

249
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.190
But now we're confronted with this.

250
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.160
And so we pray that I, I pray for me,

251
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.400
for us that we would be confronted with what you want us to

252
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.150
see here. How to be different,

253
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.870
how to put off to put to death, what is old,

254
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:57.790
what is the previous version of us, and to put on the new,

255
00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.240
but Holy Spirit, we, we need you to show us.

256
00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.290
We need you to empower us how to do that. So make it clear today. God,

257
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.260
use these words for your glory. In Jesus' name,

258
00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.830
amen. So first,

259
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.230
in light of everything Christ has done in light of all that he's made the

260
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.950
Colossians to be and all that he's done in you believer today,

261
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.390
here's the first thing. He says, put off the old self.

262
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.520
Here's how you respond. Put off the old self.

263
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.840
That's first and foremost here in verse five.

264
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.370
In fact, he says it a couple different ways. Verse five,

265
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.450
put to death what is earthly in you? The things that he says,

266
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.570
bring the wrath of God, which should be a warning sign for us. First of all,

267
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.610
this stuff that if I'm doing that brings the wrath of God, man,

268
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.010
I should be really worried about doing those things.

269
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.300
So put to death what is earthly in you? Verse eight, you must put them all away.

270
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.140
What are them? What are the things he's talking about? Well,

271
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:06.980
it's what the Bible calls the ways of the world, the sinful nature,

272
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.460
the selfish flesh that is inside of each one of us that drives

273
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.420
us to rebel against God. It's the things that we once walked in,

274
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.020
the one that we just lived in. In verse seven,

275
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.340
it says the things that characterized us pre Christ,

276
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.290
every one of us, sinful nature. By birth,

277
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:32.490
we have this pre-K Christ kind of life where we're sinners,

278
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:36.390
not saints. This is what he says.

279
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.310
But to the Colossians, he says, guys,

280
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.990
this is what your life was like before Christ redeemed you.

281
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.960
This is the definition of a life outside of Christ. It's all of these things.

282
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.770
It's no different for us.

283
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:57.280
One Corinthians six describes this in a different way that we are in this

284
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.120
just as much says, do you not know that the unrighteous,

285
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.720
those who are not made right before God, not justified before God,

286
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.800
they will not inherit the kingdom of God. And here's what you know,

287
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.320
characterizes people who are unrighteous not right with God. Do not be deceived.

288
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.320
Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters, nor adulterers,

289
00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:22.440
nor those who practice homosexuality nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards,

290
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.520
nor revilers,

291
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.440
nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God and such

292
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.730
were some of you. And listen,

293
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.290
don't just pick out the big ones. When you read lists like that,

294
00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.010
you can kind of highlight a couple of those.

295
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:42.130
Did you see idolatry and greed also make you just as guilty before

296
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:42.983
God?

297
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.680
Like those are celebrated in our capitalistic culture.

298
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:53.630
But here it says no. It will actually separate you from God.

299
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.170
Yet praise God that verse 11 doesn't stop there.

300
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.960
And such were some of you, but you were washed,

301
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.230
you were sanctified, made, holy, you were justified,

302
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.310
made right in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

303
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:17.350
And by the spirit of our God. Here's his point.

304
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.070
He lists all this stuff and says such. Were some of you,

305
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.790
he's saying that kind of stuff doesn't characterize you anymore.

306
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.700
Yes, you were an adulterer. Yes, you were a liar,

307
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.180
but you're not an adulterer anymore. You're not a liar anymore.

308
00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:39.140
Might you lust, might you still lie? But that doesn't make who you are.

309
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.100
It doesn't define you anymore. You have been redeemed,

310
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.400
you've been washed, you've been sanctified, you've been justified.

311
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.200
Remember how Colossians three seven says it?

312
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.280
It says in these you two once walked, that's past tense.

313
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.760
It says, when you were living in them, yes, that's ongoing,

314
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.720
but it's past You were you once walked.

315
00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:09.440
This is characterizing you in a past tense term. And so he says,

316
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:10.600
since it's past,

317
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:16.000
that then is how and why you are able to put those worldly

318
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.720
ways to death because it's in your past.

319
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:23.000
It's not who you are anymore. Put it away.

320
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:29.770
Drag that lion out in the street and kill it because it's already

321
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.970
passed. It's not who you are in Christ anymore.

322
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.910
In fact, look again at Colossians three verse nine. It says,

323
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.470
do not lie to one another. Seeing that,

324
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:49.030
or because you might say there's a causal link here because you have

325
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:53.310
put off the old self with its practices.

326
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.830
But Paul assumes that if you're a Christian,

327
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:02.350
you already have put off the old self with his practices that it's a past

328
00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:03.853
reality.

329
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.430
You remember the the sand plum bush illustration from a couple weeks ago.

330
00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.650
What he's saying here is that your root is different Now

331
00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.280
the root is different now.

332
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:24.720
You have already put off the old self. It's already past.

333
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.430
See, this is the essence that we're talking about, this whole thing.

334
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.710
When you talk about holiness obedience, here's what the essence is.

335
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.970
Christ has changed you Christian.

336
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.760
So be more who you already are in him,

337
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.700
that that's it. That's what we're talking about here. Christ has changed you.

338
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.540
So start living more like you already are in him.

339
00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.770
We're not trying to attain something.

340
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:59.050
We already are something in him that we're just trying to live out more

341
00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.290
faithfully. That's what this is saying.

342
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.810
You were these things once walked like this before,

343
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.130
this is what you used to be. But that's not who you are anymore.

344
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.940
So live it out. Live like it, okay?

345
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.140
But if you remember back in chapter two, he,

346
00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:22.220
Paul spent a lot of time talking about how some people are adding rules onto the

347
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.620
gospel. If you do this, you don't do that,

348
00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.140
then that's gonna help you overcome sin and you'll be set, right?

349
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.700
That's what he condemned. But here's what can happen for us.

350
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.890
You hear us and we talk about overcoming sin,

351
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.410
putting death to self, right? All these things, we talk about that.

352
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.410
And what our minds can do immediately is go to the same thing that they were

353
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.710
doing in chapter two, right? I gotta, I gotta stop doing that.

354
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.870
I gotta throw my phone away. I gotta bury my tv, I gotta, you know,

355
00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.430
all these things. And we start to put rules on to say,

356
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:59.950
I can't do that stuff anymore. I gotta stay away from those kind of things.

357
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:04.030
And we can immediately think about mere external actions.

358
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.630
That's our first reaction.

359
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.070
It's not not wrong because those things are in the list here, right?

360
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.390
So we're not saying it's not about external action. Do whatever you want.

361
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.890
These things are still included. External actions,

362
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.050
things like he says in verse five, sexual immorality,

363
00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.270
which that word is where we get our word pornography from.

364
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:32.030
Its definition is any sexual activity outside of the context

365
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:37.180
of marriage. And that's a male and a female, right?

366
00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:41.380
That that's what we say outside of the context of that relationship for life.

367
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.380
Any sexual activity, pornography, it's wrong.

368
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.080
Impurity in that word. That verse is even closely related to that.

369
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.520
Like the culture of your life is impure. And just stop for a second,

370
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.480
how pervasive that temptation is in our culture today, right?

371
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.940
Like this is almost the number one thing that would distinguish by the way,

372
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:08.780
back in Colossae in this timeframe, a life of chastity.

373
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.620
Meaning you're gonna live a pure life outside of the context of marriage, right?

374
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.380
I'm gonna have no action sexually anywhere. I'm gonna reserve it for marriage.

375
00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.060
That was a revolutionary concept back then.

376
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.910
It was a huge distinguishing mark for believers whenever they started living

377
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:28.770
like that. Is it not the same today

378
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.920
you're looked at like you're crazy if you say, no, I'm I'm,

379
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.120
I'm going to reserve that for my wife or I'm gonna reserve that for my husband.

380
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.500
It people think you're nuts, but how?

381
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.380
How much? That points to the faithfulness of God.

382
00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.440
Whenever we choose to live like that,

383
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.830
it points to the distinction of the new instead of the old.

384
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.670
But that's an action that he lists here. Of course,

385
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.710
you also see in verse eight the word wrath.

386
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.550
I was trying to think of how to define that and, and I thought of dude, perfect,

387
00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.470
the rage monster, right?

388
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:10.910
Just going off on everyone you can see and everything around you that is wrath,

389
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.580
malice. He says it's similar, but it's more like the disposition.

390
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.940
A means spirit of vicious disposition towards people.

391
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:27.120
Your demeanor is malicious, slander.

392
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.320
He mentions these are actions, right? Slander.

393
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.760
Any speech that is defamatory is abusive.

394
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.970
And we think slander is some kind of like news article. No, listen, it's gossip.

395
00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.270
It's sarcasm. Used to hurt someone,

396
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.340
snarky comments. And we typically don't do that face to face.

397
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:55.040
Maybe you do sadly. But what happens is we do it online

398
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.920
or we do it behind people's backs.

399
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.113
Slander.

400
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.500
He says in verse eight, obscene talk.

401
00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.760
This would be anything that would be considered dirty or inappropriate for

402
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.080
Christians to talk about. Ephesians 4 29 says it this way,

403
00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.240
let no corrupting talk come outta your mouth.

404
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.420
But only such as it's good for building up as fits the occasion that it may give

405
00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.253
grace to those who hear.

406
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:30.460
When you're saying things that tear someone down instead of building them up,

407
00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.900
that's corrupting, that's obscene, not just bad words.

408
00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.940
That's obscene talk. Two

409
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.710
verse nine adds lying to the list that's deliberately misleading. Others,

410
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.790
which by the way was the reason Ananias and Sapphira died in the early church.

411
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.903
'cause they lied.

412
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.820
So you've got all these external actions

413
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.870
that we immediately jump to say, I can't do this, I gotta avoid this. Yes,

414
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.700
we do need to put those things to death. We need to put them away.

415
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.500
We should absolutely stand on the fact that if you call yourself a Christian,

416
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:12.880
you should not be doing those things. None of us.

417
00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.360
There's no room for it.

418
00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.450
And that's true. Here's the reality though.

419
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:27.470
You can set up enough fences in your life to not do any of those things.

420
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:30.230
That's not a comprehensive list, by the way. There's a whole lot more.

421
00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:34.750
But the actions, think about actions. You can set up enough rules in your life,

422
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.470
like you can tape your mouth shut. So you never say anything to anybody.

423
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.830
You could throw your phone away, you could throw your computer away.

424
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.000
You'd go live in the woods and never see anybody.

425
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.760
So you never have to interact with anybody. So you don't commit adultery,

426
00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.280
you don't lie like you could. You could set up rules

427
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.380
to keep you from doing the external actions.

428
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.740
But did you see that's not the whole list.

429
00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.310
The problem is there's more here.

430
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.190
It's just like what Jesus did in the Sermon on the Mount. Remember Matthew five,

431
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.000
he talks about the external action,

432
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.560
but he takes it a step further and he goes to the internal motivations for those

433
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.393
actions.

434
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.990
So we jump to external actions. I can't do this. I gotta set up rules. No,

435
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.510
that's not enough

436
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.230
internal motivations. Jesus said in Matthew five, I know you've heard,

437
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:31.150
it's not to commit adultery, that's fine. But I say to you,

438
00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.990
if you even look with lust,

439
00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.910
it's like you've committed adultery already in your heart. It's just as wrong.

440
00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.750
Okay? So what

441
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:50.240
this says is that even those internal motivations, those thoughts,

442
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.040
we've gotta put those away.

443
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.880
We've gotta put those to death just as much as the actions

444
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.790
that Christians should not even be thinking in an old self kind of way.

445
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.870
I mean, verse five, he talks about passions. That's a,

446
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.350
a catchall word for the internal desires of our lives.

447
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.870
Now he's talking sexual desires, of course, but he's,

448
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.710
he's com encompassing all kinds of desires here.

449
00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.410
But I wanna be careful because when we say desire,

450
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.170
that can actually be a good thing at times too. When I desire God,

451
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.810
when I desire my wife, right? Like those are good desires, but,

452
00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.650
but verse five said, a lot of those desires can be evil too.

453
00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.870
So we need to be careful with that. So passions.

454
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:42.270
So you also see covetousness here, which is the word is greed, basically,

455
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.830
which is labeled idolatry.

456
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:49.720
Like it's finding your worth and value and identity on earth, which you can do.

457
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.480
Whether you have a lot of money or you don't have any money at all.

458
00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.710
You can be covetous, you can be greedy. It's what's in your heart, right?

459
00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:02.720
He says that's idolatry. You see anger in verse eight,

460
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.080
that's the same word Jesus used in Matthew five when he talked about murdering

461
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.720
someone in your heart. He said Anger, that's that word right there.

462
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.920
And so notice that all of these are internal motivations.

463
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.120
They're things you cannot build fences around.

464
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.360
You can't keep yourself from doing it by taping your mouth or burying something

465
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.320
or throwing in the mouth in the trash. You can't do it because it's in here.

466
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.590
These are things that God must change in your heart

467
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.830
as you are actively putting them to death.

468
00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:43.900
You've gotta see God do the work. Okay? Now,

469
00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.500
how do you do that? Because the question is, I want to,

470
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.890
I still see this stuff creep back up in my heart and my life. Well,

471
00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:55.400
how do I kill it? Well, there's many, many ways, of course.

472
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.160
But part of it's confessing sin to the Lord and to others,

473
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:05.330
asking brothers and sisters for help to overcome this, to hold accountable,

474
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.970
to memorize scripture that would attack it, to uh,

475
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.610
praying regularly to therapy if you need it to.

476
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:17.810
All kinds of ways to help put to death what is

477
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.470
earthly in you, even inside you.

478
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.790
But again, remember we keep going back to this verse nine,

479
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.030
the reason you can do all of that,

480
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:35.270
the reason you can put to death even what's inside of you spiritually,

481
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.830
is because that has already been done in your life.

482
00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:43.890
You've already had the old self put off of you. It's already been put to death.

483
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.850
All that's already been defeated in Christ.

484
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.690
It's a past tense reality that you already have put off the old self in him.

485
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:58.770
And so now the practice of how to make it happen day by day in your life,

486
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.130
well, remember, God's qualified you to do it.

487
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.570
He's reconciled you into God above. You're alive.

488
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.130
You're forgiven of all of that. Even when you fail,

489
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.290
you're free from sins chains.

490
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:14.140
So you can pursue this putting off of the old self.

491
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.730
It's what Romans six says.

492
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:23.850
We know that our old self was crucified with him in order

493
00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.170
that the body of sin,

494
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.330
this might be brought to nothing so that we would no longer be enslaved

495
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:35.330
to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin.

496
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.320
It doesn't own you anymore.

497
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:44.230
So you can put it to death.

498
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:50.530
You can actively shed the old self, not because you can in yourself,

499
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.850
but because God is working in you to do that.

500
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.540
And he's done all think about those things. I said at the beginning,

501
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.380
the six things that the whole book of Colossians points us to something that God

502
00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.540
has done. I love what John Owen continued to say. He said,

503
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.780
our greatest hindrance in the Christian life is not our lack of effort,

504
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.980
but our lack of acquainted with our privileges.

505
00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.380
Just think of what God's done, what he's given you,

506
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:24.020
how much he has in store for you, and all his power, all his glory.

507
00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:28.140
It's there for you, Christian. And we forget it.

508
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.650
We move on from it. We don't remember it.

509
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.290
We choose not to abide in it.

510
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:39.810
And we try and try and try on our own. It doesn't work.

511
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.490
Remember. And then kill.

512
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.130
Remember what he's done and then go after it.

513
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.870
But if you remember in our passage today,

514
00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.590
that was not the only way to respond to all that

515
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.170
God's done,

516
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.630
all that He's given you in salvation to the work of God in your life.

517
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.870
There was something else he said to do as well.

518
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.770
We've put off the old self in Christ with its practices. Yes, but verse 10,

519
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:18.130
he says, you have also put on the new self,

520
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:22.770
put off the old self,

521
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:26.730
but also respond by putting on the new self.

522
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.450
The image is like this old, nasty, tattered,

523
00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.730
grimy robe that you've ripped off. And,

524
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.810
and instead of just giving it to goodwill,

525
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:38.810
you throw it in the trash and burn it and throw it away like everything is gone.

526
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:42.250
No, you instead, not only take off,

527
00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:47.170
you also put on the new self redeemed in Jesus.

528
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:51.170
You live out what you now are.

529
00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:57.590
And so we're gonna see this a whole lot more next week as we look at the new

530
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:01.470
self, which is 12 through 17. But, but just think about this picture.

531
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.340
The old self gone, the new self Here, it's an image of creation, right?

532
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:11.810
In fact, second Corinthians five 17, therefore if anyone was in Christ,

533
00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.090
he's a new creation. The old has passed away. The new has come.

534
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.770
So you see there's a reality of God creating something new. That's his picture.

535
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.770
Paul's painting here in this whole book.

536
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:26.650
Genesis one is in his mind as he goes back to Genesis 1 27.

537
00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.450
Remember what it says about God creating mankind.

538
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.540
God created man in his own image, in the image of God, he created him.

539
00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:39.100
Male and female, he created them. Verse 26, let us make man in our image,

540
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.660
our likeness. So he's saying, God created us.

541
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.260
God formed us in that way to begin with,

542
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:52.580
to reflect his image. We're formed by God. But,

543
00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.220
but then you'd remember Colossians one 15,

544
00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:01.190
that Christ is the image of the invisible God.

545
00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.510
Meaning the perfect image that we remember failed

546
00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:12.750
at, created to reflect. His image failed at it.

547
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:14.710
Tainted image, distorted image.

548
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:18.830
Christ shows up the perfect image of the invisible God. Now check this out.

549
00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:23.510
Colossians three 10. We know our new self,

550
00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:28.590
it says is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its

551
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.320
creator. What were we intended to do?

552
00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.760
Reflect his image. We failed at it. Christ is the perfect image.

553
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:40.120
What are we now being reformed into

554
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:46.220
His image. You see how that works? Like Paul's mind is,

555
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.420
is all about genesis and creation and now a new creation,

556
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.500
a new kingdom that he's building and put putting together and reforming.

557
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:57.580
It's to reflect the image to the world.

558
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.410
But I want you to see in verse 10, that word being renewed,

559
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:07.340
that's a present passive participle, English majors.

560
00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.500
You know what I'm talking about? But,

561
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.620
but what that means is that it's an ongoing action done to you

562
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:17.900
being renewed. It's something done to you that you're receiving.

563
00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.190
Notice what you're receiving. God is doing the renewing.

564
00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:26.790
God is giving you knowledge. God is shaping you into his image.

565
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:30.030
That's what second Corinthians three 18 says. We with unveiled face,

566
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:34.870
beholden the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from

567
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:39.630
one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord. Who is the spirit?

568
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.350
See that God's doing this. We're beholding him.

569
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.350
He's changing us into his image and he's doing it inside us.

570
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.400
We're being renewed to live this new

571
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.890
creation kingdom kind of life that we're gonna see next week.

572
00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.410
And throughout the rest of Colossians. This is what he's doing.

573
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.010
He's stripped away the old self. He's saying it's dead. It's gone.

574
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.050
Don't live in it anymore.

575
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:11.160
Here's what it looks like to live a new life that you can because

576
00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.880
God is doing it in you.

577
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.500
So listen, church believer,

578
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:29.170
remember this. This is who you are now.

579
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.930
This is who you are. If, if you are in Christ,

580
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.060
that means you're qualified, you're reconciled,

581
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:44.110
you're alive, you're forgiven, you're free.

582
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.850
You are in the Father who, Romans 8 29,

583
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:53.890
who has predestined you to be conformed to the image of his son.

584
00:40:55.890 --> 00:41:00.010
This is what he's doing in you. He will make you like him.

585
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.470
If this is who you are, Christian,

586
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:13.320
put to death, what is earthly in you put to death,

587
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.400
what's still there from your old self?

588
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.560
Put away the things that look like the old person.

589
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:26.720
Be ruthless. Put it away. That's not who you are anymore.

590
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:35.510
It's not who you are anymore. And so externally, actions, yes. But internally,

591
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:40.510
all the motivations, all of those things in you put it all away

592
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:43.880
because of what God's done for you.
