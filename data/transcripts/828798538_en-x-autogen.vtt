WEBVTT

1
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.320
Well, good morning. Good morning. Morning boy.

2
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.760
It's good to see you this morning. I am, uh,

3
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.560
delighted to walk through and close out this, uh,

4
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.720
sermon series on the book of Joel with you. And, uh,

5
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.560
today is, uh, really,

6
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.480
it's a tough passage of scripture to preach and that's why I'm finishing it

7
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.080
last. Um, it's Joel three one through 16,

8
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.880
but because of that, I'm gonna ask a favor of you. Okay?

9
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.040
Okay. Nobody responded. That was, I'm gonna ask a favor of you, okay?

10
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.200
Okay, good. Y'all gonna have to get alive. I mean, this is, summer is here,

11
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.760
right? It is good. The sun is out. We're gonna have fun,

12
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.720
but I need a, I need a favor. All right,

13
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.760
so today's topic is pretty heavy,

14
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.840
so I'm gonna ask you if you would just give me a few minutes, all right.

15
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.080
Give me a few minutes today.

16
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.000
So if I could invite you to please limit your social

17
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.960
media activity or your texting,

18
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.960
or if you're developing your list of groceries for what you're gonna buy at the

19
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.240
grocery store today, please put that off for just a little bit.

20
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.080
Give me a couple of minutes. Can you, can you do that for me? Yes. Okay.

21
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.800
Everybody over here was like nothing, right? So apparently no.

22
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.600
Are you guys, is that okay? Can you give me just a few minutes? Yes. All right,

23
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.680
cool. All right. So here's the deal.

24
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.160
Today we're looking at a passage of scripture that is hard

25
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.760
to deal with. It's, it's heavy, and, uh,

26
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.040
so we'll walk through it together to get us where I want us to go. Uh,

27
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.000
let me first of all say thank you for the opportunity to preach here for this

28
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.920
past few weeks. It's been awesome. I love your pastor, I love your elders, and,

29
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.040
uh, it is just great to be with you. So thank you so much. Uh, second thing,

30
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.960
let me just say thank you for your continued prayers. Obu,

31
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.240
u's gonna have a 12 to 24 month recovery period. And so, uh,

32
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.760
pray for us, work with us. Uh,

33
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.400
if you see stuff on social media or in the news or whatever,

34
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.800
continue to pray for us or help us in any way that you can, uh,

35
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.950
and we'll be grateful. Third thing to get us,

36
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.340
I want you to, uh, understand something.

37
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.060
When I approach scripture,

38
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.980
one of the things that I do is I bring my experience to it,

39
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.780
and I can't help that we all do that. But some of our experiences,

40
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.900
my experiences in life are kind of strange. One of those experiences is, uh,

41
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.420
if you don't know this about my wife and I, we moved to the uk and, uh,

42
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.420
when we moved to the uk, uh, life turned, uh,

43
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.780
in a really unexpected direction. We had, uh, our daughter,

44
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.500
our oldest daughter who just graduated high school. She was born over there.

45
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.540
Our oldest son was about four or five months old when we went over there. And,

46
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.060
uh, I got to serve in two churches while I was there. It was wonderful.

47
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.180
One of those churches, and you may not know this about the uk,

48
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.020
but they have different class levels over there. Uh,

49
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.940
you have aristocracy and you have kind of the common class.

50
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.870
And one of the churches that we served, um, they had two,

51
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.310
uh, lords in that church. And Lords.

52
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.590
I mean, what is a Lord? I mean, what is that? I know about it. Uh,

53
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.750
only because of the Christmas song. Uh, what is it? Seven Lords are leaping,

54
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.590
right? That's it. What is the Lord? I have no idea.

55
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.510
But I learned about 'em while I was over there because, uh,

56
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.510
they were aristocracy. It was a certain class of folks.

57
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.030
And I remember one time one of the lords in our church, uh,

58
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.470
and he had this very kind of highfalutin accent.

59
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.910
He said, oh, you know, Charles came by the other day.

60
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.070
Charles, who's Charles? Is he in charge? I mean,

61
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.630
what are we talking about here, Charles?

62
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.030
And at the time it was Prince Charles came by his house.

63
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.350
What you need to understand is his house was this very old church.

64
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.270
The church that I had served had been a sight of Christian worship for a

65
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.430
thousand years. And so it was a very old, uh, church.

66
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.550
The building was old and stone. And the, the house that our,

67
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.790
the Lord lived in was right next to the church.

68
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.240
And he was talking about Prince Charles. Now,

69
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.040
king Charles was coming to his house for a visit. I said, really?

70
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.680
Wow, what kind of car did he drive? He said, oh, he flew

71
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.840
what? Yeah, landed his helicopter right there on the lawn. Of course, as you do,

72
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.240
apparently. So why am I telling you this story?

73
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.160
Because that was a momentous event in this lord's life.

74
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.450
The Prince was coming to visit. Now let me ask you a question.

75
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.200
What if Prince, now King Charles came to your house?

76
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.910
How would you prepare? What would you do? Well,

77
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.030
I think probably you would get some really good food like Chick-fil-A

78
00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.000
and serve it to 'em. Or maybe Chicken Express. Who's the better Chicken?

79
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.480
Yeah, I like the fact that you have opinions on this. This is fun, right? Right.

80
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.320
It's clearly Chick-fil-A, although chicken express is pretty good.

81
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.640
I've probably missed a chicken place, I'm sure. Don't say Popeye's, just,

82
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.120
just don't. I'm, I like Popeye's. What am I talking about?

83
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.560
You'd bring some good food out, wouldn't you? You would clean the place up,

84
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.600
right? That grime that's been sitting on the island for three weeks,

85
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.360
maybe this is just my house. You'd, you'd clean that up.

86
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.800
You'd make sure that the dogs haven't destroyed something. Or if you have a cat,

87
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.720
I'll just pray for you, right? And we have a cat too.

88
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.740
You would clean the place up because the king is coming.

89
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.190
You wouldn't just kind of let things slide. You'd mow the grass,

90
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.370
trim the hedge, prepare weed, the garden.

91
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:08.210
You do all those things cuz the king's coming and

92
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.090
that visit would impact how you prepare for

93
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.450
your time between now and then.

94
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.100
Why do I tell you that story? The reason is,

95
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.260
is because actually there is a king who is coming

96
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.540
and his name isn't Charles. This dignitary is much more significant.

97
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.000
It's king Jesus. And whether, you know,

98
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.440
you sit wherever you sit on this journey of faith, right? Some of you, uh,

99
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.760
in the room may, may not be, uh, followers of Jesus at all. Uh,

100
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.400
I you're warmly welcome here.

101
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.160
Some of you may be followers of Jesus for a very long time.

102
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.560
You're warmly welcome here. Some of you may be kind of, uh, on the journey

103
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.760
and you don't really know what you believe. You're not antagonistic,

104
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.920
but you're not really committed. You're very welcome here.

105
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.950
What I'm gonna share with you today is no matter where you are on the faith

106
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.630
journey, here's what you need to understand. The king is coming

107
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.510
and from our text in scripture, he's coming as a judge.

108
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.090
And we need to understand that because that day

109
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.400
needs to impact today.

110
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.830
All right? And we get this from the passage of scripture.

111
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.230
We're looking at Joel chapter three, verses one through 16.

112
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.670
The topic of today's, or the title of today's message is the Judge is Coming.

113
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.830
So if you have your Bible, turn to Joel chapter three, beginning in verse one.

114
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.190
Uh, beginning in verse one,

115
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.020
the text reads this, yes, in those days, and at that time,

116
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.560
when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,

117
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.480
I will gather all the nations and take them to the valley of

118
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.360
je fat, fat. What are we talking about here?

119
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.200
I'll unpack that word in just a minute.

120
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.140
I will enter into judgment with them because there, because of my people,

121
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.900
my inheritance, Israel,

122
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.260
the nations have scavenged the Israelites in foreign countries and divided up my

123
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.740
land, they cast lots for my people.

124
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.580
They bartered a boy for a prostitute and sold a girl for wine to drink.

125
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.300
So what the Texas is talking about is nations clearly enemy nations that are

126
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.900
against God and his people. These enemy nations have trafficked human beings,

127
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.100
particularly the people of Judah, Jerusalem. They've trafficked not just adults,

128
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.540
they've human trafficked boys and girls. Now,

129
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.620
I don't know what your experience is with the Bible,

130
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.700
but sometimes I'm reading the Bible and I'm going, why is that in there?

131
00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.680
Because it's a hard text. This is one of those, but it gets harder.

132
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.200
Look at verses four through eight.

133
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.360
Verses four through eight is kind of like an expansion on verse three.

134
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.080
And it gets further detail to that picture.

135
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.550
And also tire Sid and all the territories of Felicia. What are you to me?

136
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.990
God is speaking. Are you paying me back or trying to get even with me?

137
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.840
I'll quickly bring retribution on your heads for you took my silver and my

138
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.600
gold and carried my finest treasures to your temples.

139
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.920
You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks to remove them far from

140
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.400
their own territory. Look,

141
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.280
I'm about to rouse them up from the place where you sold them.

142
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.800
I'll bring retribution on your heads.

143
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.520
I'll sell your sons and your daughters to the people of Judah and they will sell

144
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.080
them to Thess, to a distant nation. For the Lord has spoken. Woo,

145
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.760
that's heavy duty stuff. I'll come back to it at the end of the message.

146
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.200
Verse nine, proclaim this among the nations. Prepare for Holy War,

147
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.360
rouse the Warriors.

148
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.880
Let all the men of war advance and attack beat your

149
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.720
plows into swords, your pruning knives into spears.

150
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.760
So the image here is those instruments that are designed to cultivate for

151
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.480
life, which are, uh, pruning hooks. That means that you're,

152
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.960
you're taking excess

153
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.400
limbs and whatnot away from, uh,

154
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.640
fruit bearing trees like olive trees or uh,

155
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.640
apple trees or pro pomegranate trees or fig trees. All that,

156
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:41.080
that's pruning. And then, uh, it says, uh,

157
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.320
beat your your plows. Plows, as we all know is or or for planting,

158
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.320
right? So he is saying,

159
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.480
take these instruments that cultivate life and make them instruments of death.

160
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.160
Now we have the inversion of this picture in for instance, uh,

161
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:03.320
Micah and in Isaiah where it's God's vision of restoration

162
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.440
is, uh,

163
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.640
turn your swords into plow and turn your,

164
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.000
uh, spears into pruning hooks.

165
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.320
So we have the inversion of this in a restoration Oracle and Micah four and

166
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.320
Isaiah two. Uh,

167
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.480
but here it's take those instruments of life and cultivation of life and make

168
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.240
them instruments of war. Let even the weaklings say,

169
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.120
I'm a warrior. Come quickly, all you surrounding nations, gather yourselves.

170
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.400
Bring down your warriors there. Oh Lord,

171
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.940
let the nations be aroused and come to the valley of Jehoshaphat.

172
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.940
There's the second right jehoshaphat, okay, what does that mean for there?

173
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.300
I will judge all surrounding nations.

174
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.340
Swing the sickle because the harvest is ripe.

175
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.180
Come and trample the grapes because the wine press is full.

176
00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.300
The wine vats overflow because the wickedness of the nation's is extreme.

177
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.573
Multitudes.

178
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:06.100
Multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the Lord is near in the

179
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.460
valley of decision. The sun and moon will grow dark.

180
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.780
The stars will cease their shining.

181
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.220
The Lord will roar from Zion and make his voice heard from Jerusalem.

182
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.740
Heaven and earth will shake, but the Lord will be a refuge for his people,

183
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.490
A stronghold for the Israelites. Now you might be thinking,

184
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.530
holy cow, what are we looking at today? I told you it's a hard text.

185
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.530
So in the time that I have,

186
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.890
I just really wanna focus on two reflections from this text.

187
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.370
And the first one might seem counterintuitive. We've just heard about, uh,

188
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.570
God's battle against the nations where all these instruments of life are

189
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.610
now transformed in instruments of death and war.

190
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.930
So what's the first reflection that's counterintuitive?

191
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.490
Here's the first reflection that might seem counterintuitive.

192
00:13:55.630 --> 00:14:00.530
Are you ready Again, y'all have to talk, right?

193
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.650
Are you ready? Okay. Yes. Good.

194
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:08.720
Here's the first reflection from this passage.

195
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.160
We see this truth.

196
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.960
Divine blessing is certain I told you it's

197
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.793
counterintuitive,

198
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:22.640
but we get it from the bookends of this passage in verse one and verse 16,

199
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.640
look at verse one. Verse one says,

200
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:31.080
when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem and then in verse

201
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.400
16 it says,

202
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.640
the Lord will roar from Zion and make his voice heard from Jerusalem.

203
00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.080
Heaven and earth will shake,

204
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.040
but the Lord will be a refuge for his people.

205
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.200
So bookending, this

206
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.320
clear presentation of divine judgment.

207
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:54.160
You have a picture of restoration and refuge.

208
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.373
Why?

209
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:02.040
Because these verses are drawn from the Old Testament story.

210
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.680
This language of restoring the fortunes is language that shows up in the minor

211
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.040
prophets at various places.

212
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.840
But it's always picturing God's commitment to his purposes, to renew,

213
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.510
restore, and bless Israel. Why?

214
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.550
Because the story of Israel is a story of divine blessing.

215
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.330
Now let me unpack that for a minute.

216
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.930
This language of restoring the fortunes of his people means that when

217
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.850
God comes to judge, there are those,

218
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.290
namely those who have been faithful to him. Uh, even in hardship.

219
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.570
They've stepped across the line of faith and they've said, we are your people.

220
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.570
You are our God.

221
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.280
God is gonna restore the fortunes of that crew.

222
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.200
It's more than just a geopolitical entity on a map. Why?

223
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.040
Because probably at the time in which this text was written,

224
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.240
there really wasn't a geopolitical nation called Israel or

225
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.760
Judah. So it's a theological reality. It's a theological category.

226
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.520
And he's talking about those people that stay faithful to the Lord no matter

227
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.423
what the cost.

228
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.540
And he's going to restore them to their place as his people

229
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.100
under his rule, the kingdom of God.

230
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.110
That's what he's talking about.

231
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.970
And then he says in the day of judgment, verse 16,

232
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.130
not only will he restore their their fortunes, he's going to be a refuge.

233
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.330
And that means divine judgment is coming.

234
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.840
But divine blessing is the purpose.

235
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.800
Judgment is coming, yes, but God is a refuge on that day of judgment. Why?

236
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.560
So that when judgment comes,

237
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.480
they are preserved and blessed. That's the picture.

238
00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.320
Now what you and I need to understand about this passage is it's building out

239
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.080
from the Old Testament story.

240
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.640
Why does God insist on restoring the fortunes of Israel? Well,

241
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.120
one idea might be this. Some of you might be thinking,

242
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.160
I know why God's restoring that pe,

243
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.880
that group Israel or Judah Jerusalem is because God plays favorites.

244
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.640
He likes these people. He doesn't like those people. He likes Israel,

245
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.600
but he doesn't like anybody else. God's racist.

246
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:32.250
Or maybe he's xenophobic. He doesn't like strangers or foreigners.

247
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.280
That's completely wrong.

248
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.310
I know what we might think that way cuz it kind of reads that way.

249
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.590
But when you read this text in its larger Old Testament story context,

250
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:46.950
what you I gotta understand is the people of Israel are not just a nation.

251
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.320
They are a people for a purpose. And the purpose is very simple.

252
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:55.160
Through this people, God is going to bless the world.

253
00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.440
How do I know that?

254
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:02.420
Because the story of Israel is part of God's rescue mission to

255
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.420
renew and restore the entire world.

256
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.940
We know this from Genesis one to three. What the reality is,

257
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:15.660
is God created a world that is good, but human beings your story.

258
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.740
And my story is that we look at the world that God has made and say, yeah,

259
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.820
that's fine, but I wanna live my own way.

260
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.100
It's like that Fleetwood Max song. You know that song, right?

261
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.300
You can go your own way. Now you might not understand the words I just said,

262
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.700
Fleetwood Mac, but if you didn't, you need to get out more.

263
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.500
That's a great song. You can go your own way.

264
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.780
Well here's what happens when we go our own way,

265
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.810
what happens in your life? What happens in the life of Adam and Eve?

266
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:53.170
According to Genesis three, when we go our own way, things break

267
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.260
and they break bad. It's like this. When Adam and Eve,

268
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.460
our first human couple, when they sin against God, they go their own way.

269
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.700
They say, I really can do what I want. I don't need to live God's way.

270
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.900
It's like the entire creative world goes like this and their lives

271
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.220
do the same thing. The world is complicated by uh,

272
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.500
that thing that we call human sin.

273
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.540
S i n is a three letter word of terror that wreaks havoc in our

274
00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.383
lives.

275
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.270
And so the story of humanity from Genesis three onward is a story of

276
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.323
sin.

277
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.360
Breaking a apart and fragmenting God's good world, sin fragments everything.

278
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.870
Now, God could have junked the world at that point. He could have said, ah,

279
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.670
these humans, I'm gonna start all over, but God doesn't junk the world.

280
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.503
Do you know why

281
00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.110
God doesn't make junk?

282
00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.650
So if God has created you and I,

283
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:04.570
you need to understand He created you and I for a purpose and

284
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.910
he doesn't junk us because he doesn't make junk.

285
00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.240
So what God does from Genesis three onward,

286
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.640
and he does it particularly in Genesis 12 to 22,

287
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.840
we see this picture of God raises up a people for himself and it's a

288
00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.320
family. It's the family of Abraham.

289
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:26.120
And what the text says is God called Abraham out of what is

290
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.440
modern day Iraq.

291
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.750
And he called them out of modern day Iraq and he called them to

292
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.710
serve him. And he says in Genesis 12, two to three,

293
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.470
he says, I'm going to bless you. I'm gonna make your name great.

294
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:48.620
I'm gonna give you a family. And then he makes this statement.

295
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.060
He says, through you,

296
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.300
all the nations of the earth will be blessed.

297
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.260
The story of Israel Abram's family is a story of God's purpose

298
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.300
to bless the world that he has created and he does so by raising up

299
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:09.020
a particular people to be a blessing to everybody else.

300
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.970
So it's God through the particular people that is that family of

301
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.803
Israel.

302
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.930
That family of Israel is designed in God's purposes to turn back the

303
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.763
curse

304
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.380
of sin and be a blessing to all of us.

305
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:34.120
That story gains further clarity in Genesis, in uh,

306
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.800
the book of Exodus where that family has been delivered from Egyptian

307
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:43.760
bondage, the people of Israel, that family of Abraham. And God says in Genesis,

308
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.000
in Exodus 19, verses five through six, their purpose. He says,

309
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.360
I've called you out of all the nations of the earth.

310
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:55.440
You are my treasured possession and I'm gonna make you a

311
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.480
kingdom of priests and a holy nation, a kingdom of priests.

312
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.240
That means they're sons and daughters of the King, king Jesus.

313
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.800
And they are to be a priest like kingdom.

314
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.480
How is that possible? Well, you gotta understand priests in the Old Testament,

315
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.800
they did a few things. Number one, they prayed,

316
00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:21.160
they stood in the gap between others and God, that's what priests did.

317
00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.120
So Israel is now standing the gap between the nations and God,

318
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:29.160
they're praying for the nations and they're teaching the nations God's law.

319
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.680
That's what priests do. They teach, they pray and they stand in the gap.

320
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.910
So Israel is to be that. But here's the big kicker.

321
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.710
If Israel's gonna be a kingdom of priests, they have to be a holy nation.

322
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.670
That means pure and undefiled set apart for God's purposes.

323
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:52.470
And this is where Israel's story mirror mirrors the story of Adam

324
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.270
and Eve. Israel's story is they sin too.

325
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.130
And that's a problem. So is God gonna abandon his plan?

326
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.050
No, he swears by his own name that he won't do that.

327
00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.920
So in the fullness of time, and this is where it's powerful,

328
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:14.590
God raises up

329
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.130
a king who is his own son,

330
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.380
who is the true Israel, he's the true prophet,

331
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.740
he's the true priest, he's the true judge.

332
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.560
He's Israel incarnate.

333
00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.560
And this one man

334
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.700
fulfills the entire story of Israel. His name is Jesus.

335
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.030
And through this person, Jesus,

336
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:55.050
the story of Israel is fulfilled. And through this one man,

337
00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.890
God's perfect Son,

338
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.610
God completes the story of Israel, which means that by blessing him,

339
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.420
all the rest of the world can experience blessing too.

340
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.870
So when God is saying in Joel three,

341
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.630
one and three 16 that he's restoring the fortunes of Jerusalem and Judah,

342
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.240
he's drawing us back to that story.

343
00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.690
God's not saying I like you, but I don't like you. No,

344
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:36.410
that's not the way that God works. God's not saying like you and I do, any me,

345
00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.850
Mindy, Moe, ketchup a tiger by the tote. Now, that's not the way God works.

346
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.920
What God is doing is he is being faithful

347
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.250
to the story of blessing. He began in the family of Abraham,

348
00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.330
he's restoring their fortunes.

349
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.210
This is pointing us to the work and the person of Jesus.

350
00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:00.330
How does this happen? How does restoration happen? My friends? It's Jesus.

351
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.090
You know, it's interesting. I don't know if you've ever done this.

352
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.130
I would encourage you to do this.

353
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.250
Read the gospel of Luke and just write down how many times Jesus talks about

354
00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:13.200
blessing, blessing of the poor and spirit,

355
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.600
blessed to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.

356
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.840
You remember what Jesus did when the little children came running to him,

357
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.793
he blessed them.

358
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.050
What we need to understand is Jesus is not just a dude who lives

359
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.050
in our hearts.

360
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.010
Jesus is God's agent of blessing for your life.

361
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.120
This is who God is.

362
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.120
God is in the business of blessing a broken world,

363
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.320
and he does it through Jesus.

364
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:49.000
You and I experience the blessing of God when we follow Jesus because Jesus

365
00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.040
is the fulfillment of the story

366
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.903
of Israel.

367
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.530
So what you and I need to understand is bookending,

368
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.610
this section about judgment is blessing. Verse one,

369
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.810
verse 16. And those who follow Jesus,

370
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.650
that means what we do is we say, I can't go my own way.

371
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.050
I gotta go your way.

372
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.490
I'm gonna step across the line of faith and submit my very life to you.

373
00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.810
Lord Jesus, when we do that, you and I

374
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.550
experience Christ Christ's blessing.

375
00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:31.590
And you and I experience purpose and you and I experience forgiveness in life.

376
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.050
That's Jesus.

377
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.260
So divine blessing is certain from this passage of scripture,

378
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.280
but the vast majority of of this text is talking about something different.

379
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.120
Namely divine judgment,

380
00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.040
divine judgment is certain as well.

381
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:58.640
The final sections here in Joel three depict a time in which God will judge

382
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.000
the nations. Verses two and verse 12 indicate,

383
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:06.680
the place of this judgment is called the valley of Jha. Fat,

384
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.960
JHA fat in the Bible names mean things. And sure enough,

385
00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.960
the name here is significant because it literally means yah.

386
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.480
Judges yahs the word Yahweh, which is the name of God.

387
00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:24.080
So another way to say this is God judges the valley that is

388
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.240
going to be this battle is the place where God judges, what does he judge?

389
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.890
He judges wickedness and sin. Sin.

390
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:40.570
The valley of Jehoshaphat is the place where God judges wicked and sin.

391
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:45.090
Now what we need to understand is the value of Jehoshaphat is not a location

392
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.850
that's identifiable on a map. It's a prophetic picture of divine judgment.

393
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:54.170
And here we see later on in the, in the these verses,

394
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.250
it's called the valley of decision where God's gonna

395
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.050
contend with the nation. So it's a valley of judgment. God judges, jehoshaphat,

396
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.650
it's a valley of decision. That valley of decision,

397
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.410
that language is talking really about a final judgment and an ultimate judgment.

398
00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.290
A place where the wicked are going to be revealed as wicked.

399
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.330
And they're not gonna be in God's home, Zion.

400
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:23.250
But those who have stepped across a line of faith and are faithful to the Lord,

401
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:29.470
they are people of Zion. And in that day of judgment,

402
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:34.070
the value of decision, guess what? God is gonna be a refuge for this group,

403
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.070
but not a refuge for this group.

404
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.660
Divine judgment in this passage looks like divine war

405
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:44.930
verses nine through 11,

406
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.370
speak of Holy war and warriors and battle against sin.

407
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:55.010
Now, some of us don't like that language war. Ah, Jesus is a, you know,

408
00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.530
peaceful. He's not. Here's what we need to understand about this.

409
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.540
The reason this looks like war

410
00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.540
is because God is not passive when it comes to wickedness and sin.

411
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.660
And you and I should find comfort in that. Let me tell you why.

412
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:18.540
Let me just use some words and tell you just how do you feel about these words?

413
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.820
Corruption, injustice,

414
00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:29.420
rape, abuse, exploitation,

415
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.790
greed. How do you, how do you feel when you hear these words?

416
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:40.740
Some of you feel hurt, some of us feel angry. Some of us feel uncomfortable.

417
00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:46.160
Good, we should do you know why

418
00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:49.900
that stuff is wrong

419
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:56.530
and it's good that we feel that it's wrong. Lying,

420
00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.213
cheating.

421
00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.410
How do you feel about these things? Well, if you feel

422
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.730
about that, those words,

423
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.370
how do you think God who is holy,

424
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.170
just and true feels about those things?

425
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:23.830
God is perfect. God has created a world that is good. God is holy,

426
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.130
God is true.

427
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:36.080
God doesn't want in his world those things that we feel, know,

428
00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:41.600
sense or wrong. And he doesn't just passively sit by why that stuff is here.

429
00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:48.520
This text reminds us that God goes to war against sin

430
00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.750
and these nations that think themselves strong,

431
00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.300
the picture here is it's almost like a little spark that's

432
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.133
this big.

433
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:06.940
It's infinitesimal the spark that's the power of the nations.

434
00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.020
And they're coming against God who is the ocean?

435
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:18.280
What's hope does this little spark the nations have on the day of judgment

436
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.720
against the ocean? They don't have any hope.

437
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.640
That's the point in the valley of decision.

438
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:29.640
When God judges wickedness and sin here signified by enemy nations that

439
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.240
represent sin,

440
00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:38.980
there is no hope for victory. God wins.

441
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.840
But the point is,

442
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.080
God wins against wickedness and sin.

443
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.960
So divine judgment looks like the judge pronouncing verdict on the wicked.

444
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:57.760
Look at what the text says. Verse 12. Let the nations be roused,

445
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.160
come to the valley of ssha F for there I will sit down to judge

446
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.880
all the surrounding nations. And that judgment looks like this.

447
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.920
Swing the sickle because the harvest is ripe,

448
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.760
come trample the grapes because the vine press is full.

449
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:16.320
The vine bats overflow because of the wickedness of the nations.

450
00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.440
Is the scream e extreme?

451
00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.040
The point here is that God comes to judge the nations and

452
00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:28.520
the verdict is against the wicked. This valley of Jehoshaphat,

453
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.120
it reminds us that

454
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.980
God's verdict against the wicked is sure

455
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:40.040
it's going to happen. Now, some of us might be be thinking in the room, well,

456
00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.420
when is that gonna happen? Has it already happened? When is it gonna happen?

457
00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:50.020
Well, again, the texts give us indications. You know, the the great, uh,

458
00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.380
medieval theologian, his name is Thomas Aquinas.

459
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.860
He follows a long tradition within Christian thought who saw the valley of

460
00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.860
Jehoshaphat, of the valley of decision here in Joel three.

461
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.700
He connected that to the location of Jesus' final judgment on

462
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.460
the wicked in his tr treatise on last things. His big book was called, uh,

463
00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:14.100
it's multi-volume book called Summa Theolog. And in that book,

464
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:19.100
he connects this text to Jesus' final

465
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.213
judgment.

466
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.860
And that is in Revelation for instance 14 or Revelation 20

467
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.180
and Revelation 14 or 20, let me just draw your attention to it looks like this.

468
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.410
I'll read in verse four. In, in chapter 14, uh, beginning in verse 14,

469
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:40.090
then I looked and there was a little, uh, a, a white cloud. And the son of one,

470
00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:41.930
like the son of man was seated on the cloud.

471
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:46.450
That's Jesus with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.

472
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.970
And then the angel came out of the temple saying,

473
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:55.010
use your sickle and reap for the time to reap has come since the harvest of

474
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:55.970
the earth is ripe.

475
00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:00.050
So the one seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth and the earth was

476
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.690
harvested. And then look at verse 14, uh, 18.

477
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.170
Another angel who had authority over fire came from the altar.

478
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.290
He called with a loud voice, the one who had the sharp sickle, that's Jesus.

479
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:12.103
He says,

480
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:16.130
use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the vineyard of the

481
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.970
earth because its grapes have ripened.

482
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:22.170
So the angels swung his sickle at the earth and he gathered the grapes from the

483
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:25.290
vineyard of the earth and he threw them into the great wine press of God's

484
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.123
wrath.

485
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.810
Then the press was trampled outside the city and blood flowed out of the press

486
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:34.650
up to the horse's bridals for about 180 miles. Yikes.

487
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.430
So what we need to understand here is when John,

488
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.630
who wrote the book of Revelation has this vision of Jesus,

489
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.870
the vision resonates with what we see here in Joel three.

490
00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:51.830
What we need to understand is this is talking about the final judgment,

491
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.990
the final judgment, where God comes to judge the living and the dead.

492
00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:03.610
The nations who are set against God and the nation, Israel,

493
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.503
new Jerusalem,

494
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:09.170
the people of Judah and Jerusalem who have remained faithful to Jesus.

495
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.970
This is the reality. This is what this text is pointing us to.

496
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.110
It's pointing us to a final judgment.

497
00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:18.630
The valley of decision,

498
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:23.710
the place where God is going to weigh our deed. And let me just tell you,

499
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.030
those who are wicked on the day of judgment, it doesn't go well for them.

500
00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:32.070
In fact, revelation 20 pictures this in this way,

501
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.670
those who have set themselves against God

502
00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:37.960
are thrown into the lake of fire.

503
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.850
Hell separation from God forever.

504
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.910
And I know, you know, sometimes we don't like to hear this or talk about it,

505
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:51.240
but here's the reality, I can't get around it.

506
00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:54.920
It's here in the text. So this is our authority. We gotta,

507
00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.280
we gotta understand it.

508
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:03.770
So this tax is pointing us to judgment,

509
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.480
And it's not vengeful. It's perfect judgment.

510
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.600
And the reason we know this is because it's like verses four through eight,

511
00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.760
verses four through eight look horrific because you're talking about human

512
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.840
trafficking. But you gotta understand in the ancient world,

513
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.680
in the ancient world, whatever, a judge gave a verdict of a judge could say,

514
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:28.120
yeah, I know you've accidentally killed someone in,

515
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:32.600
in an inadvertent manslaughter, but in the ancient world, somebody could say,

516
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.200
I know you did that, and I know it was an accident. But I tell you what,

517
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.040
this'll be the, uh, the justice, uh,

518
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:44.020
this person who was affected can go kill your entire family. Now,

519
00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:48.660
is that just no, because it's not balance.

520
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.460
It's not like, uh, equal measure.

521
00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.260
What you need to understand is in the ancient uh, world,

522
00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.540
that's that's how things work. But in the scriptures,

523
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.540
God gives a different vision of justice. It's called the law of equal measure.

524
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:08.940
Retribution. You've probably heard it like this. An eye for an eye,

525
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.460
a tooth for a tooth. We might think of that as really harsh.

526
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.900
But in the ancient world, that's extraordinary. Fair,

527
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:24.300
equal measure, punishment can't exceed the crime.

528
00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.340
That's the biblical vision. Why?

529
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.980
Because the law itself testifies to a god of justice.

530
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.950
So you and I might not like the fact

531
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.240
that this exists in the Bible, but here's the deal.

532
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:44.040
God is not going to allow sin that is creation destroying to

533
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:49.120
impinge on his holy perfect and just pure world that he is creating.

534
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.023
He's not gonna do it.

535
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.430
And so he's going to judge sin perfectly.

536
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.210
And those who embrace him are going to experience joy.

537
00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:04.620
And those who do not will not. Now,

538
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.790
if that's true, my friends,

539
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.240
if divine judgment is certain,

540
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.210
H

541
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.930
How do we stand on that day

542
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:24.070
when the king comes? How are we gonna stand?

543
00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:39.290
Today we celebrate what's called the Eucharist,

544
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.970
the Lord's Supper. Maybe you've heard it said,

545
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.570
do you know why it's called Eucharist?

546
00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.270
Because in the gospel of Matthew, which I'm about to read,

547
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:55.790
Jesus gave thanks and broke the bread and

548
00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:56.903
poured the cup,

549
00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:01.070
and he had the meal that we're about to celebrate with his disciples.

550
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.960
And that word of giving thanks is called in the Greek

551
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.760
Eucharist. He gave thanks. So it's the Eucharist.

552
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:15.880
It's a Thanksgiving meal where we remember what Christ has done.

553
00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.000
We give thanks because Jesus

554
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:24.420
is our way of escape on the day of judgment.

555
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.300
In fact, this day of judgment,

556
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.730
those who have stepped across the line of faith and say, Jesus,

557
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.630
I want I want to live for you. I i want to experience blessing,

558
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.390
not just in eternity, but now

559
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.700
because Jesus shed his blood and his body was broken,

560
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.620
you and I can experience forgiveness of sins

561
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.040
and be reconciled to God.

562
00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.130
And I don't know where you are in your faith journey,

563
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.410
but what we're about to do is that celebration.

564
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:08.130
We remember what Jesus did on the cross. He shed his blood for you and me.

565
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:12.770
He broke his bodies that you and I might be brought home to God. Jesus,

566
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.570
I love the way that one scholar says this. He says,

567
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:20.570
Jesus went to the far country of our sin to bring

568
00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:24.100
us home. How can we be certain

569
00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.390
that God will be our refuge on the day of judgment?

570
00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.680
Look to Jesus and live.

571
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:41.050
Now we are about to, uh,

572
00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.580
embody with our actions. What we have just learned,

573
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.190
what Jesus has done on the cross is

574
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:57.870
good news for those who rely on him. But for those who reject, uh,

575
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:00.430
Jesus, it's a word of judgment against them.
