00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:10.205
Hi, my name is Donna and my name is Austin,

2
00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:12.205
and we'd love to share with you

3
00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:14.765
how God has written our family story through adoption.

4
00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:18.245
Austin and I were married in 2003 and soon

5
00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:19.485
after we became pregnant,

6
00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:22.445
but at four months, our son's heart stopped beating

7
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:24.605
without ever holding him.

8
00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:25.805
We had to say goodbye.

9
00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:28.085
That loss was devastating,

10
00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.965
but even then, we clung to the truth that God had a plan.

11
00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:35.125
In 2007, Austin joined the army

12
00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:36.845
and just a couple years later,

13
00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:38.645
he was deployed to Afghanistan.

14
00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:41.525
While on guard duty, he was shot by a fellow soldier.

15
00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:44.125
He spent 21 months in the hospital

16
00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:46.125
and our life was forever changed,

17
00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:48.925
but again, we knew God still had a plan.

18
00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:52.445
Years later, when we tried to start a family, we found out

19
00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:54.405
because of Austin's injury, we wouldn't be able

20
00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:55.405
to have children together.

21
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.685
Biologically, God began stirring adoption in our hearts

22
00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.445
and we knew that was the path he had for us.

23
00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:05.125
The process was anything but simple.

24
00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:08.245
We experienced false starts and disappointments.

25
00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:10.925
A baby girl we prayed for but didn't bring home,

26
00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:14.525
and a baby boy we were told would be ours only to have

27
00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:16.005
that fall through overnight.

28
00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:19.605
We were heartbroken. Yet God kept whispering,

29
00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:21.165
don't give up, trust me.

30
00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:24.845
And sure enough, that same little boy came back into our

31
00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:28.165
lives at just four days old, Gabriel was in the nicu,

32
00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:30.885
and even though we left him de handed at first,

33
00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:34.845
God made a way through prayer court hearings

34
00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:37.085
and a law that allowed us to intervene.

35
00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:39.005
Gabriel came home to us

36
00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.525
and three months later we finalized his adoption.

37
00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:45.925
Gabriel is funny, smart, and full of faith.

38
00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:48.685
He keeps us on our toes with his questions about God

39
00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:51.005
and his boldness to stand up for his friends.

40
00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:54.285
We thought our family was complete,

41
00:01:55.345 --> 00:01:56.525
but God had another plan.

42
00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:57.685
And in 2018,

43
00:01:58.125 --> 00:02:01.285
a distant relative brought us a baby girl who needed a home.

44
00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:03.165
We prayed and prayed,

45
00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:05.325
and soon in Berlin came to live with us.

46
00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.925
Her journey was long with years of paperwork

47
00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:10.645
and delays, especially through C,

48
00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:14.685
but in December of 2021, she officially became our daughter.

49
00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:18.085
Linn is our princess with a little bit of spice.

50
00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:20.405
She is kind, loves Jesus,

51
00:02:20.545 --> 00:02:23.925
and has a fierce determination in everything she does

52
00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:27.125
Through loss, injury, waiting

53
00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:30.325
and heartbreak, we've learned that adoption is not easy,

54
00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:31.885
but it is beautiful.

55
00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:34.485
There's no DNA shared yet.

56
00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:37.125
We look at our kids and see so many ways.

57
00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:41.365
God has knit us together as a family. Too often we hear you.

58
00:02:41.435 --> 00:02:43.125
Your kids are so lucky to have you,

59
00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:46.445
but the truth is, we are the lucky ones, Gabriel,

60
00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.205
and are the greatest gifts God could have given us.

61
00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:53.925
If you ever feel the smallest tug towards adoption, I want

62
00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:55.685
to encourage you, don't ignore it.

63
00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:59.565
There are so many children who long for a home, a family,

64
00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:01.405
and the safety of being loved.

65
00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:03.565
None of them chose their beginning story,

66
00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:06.485
but you can choose to show them God's love.

67
00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:08.805
We never imagined this would be our journey,

68
00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:10.685
but we wouldn't change a thing

69
00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:13.445
because through it all, God has shown us

70
00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:15.085
that he truly had a plan.
