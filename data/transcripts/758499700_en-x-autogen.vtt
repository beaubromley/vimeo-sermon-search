1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.200
Who is

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.500
the god like Yahweh the god

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.200
of wrath the god of Mercy The

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.800
God Who reaches down to unworthy

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.000
people.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.000
first Peter 2 verses 9 and 10

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.600
says this

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.000
but you are a chosen race a royal

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
priesthood.

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.900
a holy nation

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.700
a people for his own possession that you may proclaim

12
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.500
the excellencies of him who called you out of Darkness

13
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.800
Into His Marvelous Light.

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.300
Once you were not a people, but now

15
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.300
you are God's people.

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.600
Once you had not received Mercy, but now you have

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.500
received Mercy.

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.900
Maybe you've never thought of yourself like that before.

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.300
That if you have turned from your sin and yourself, and you've turned to Jesus,

20
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
he says you are a chosen race.

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.100
You are God's possession. He's brought you

22
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.600
out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light.

23
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.200
You are a royal priesthood.

24
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.500
Meaning you have access to God through the veil that was torn

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.900
and you have status before God.

26
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.300
But it also says you are a holy nation.

27
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.100
That word. Holy means set apart.

28
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.200
means distinct

29
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.900
different than all the other groups in the world a holy

30
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.700
nation. Have you ever thought of yourself in those

31
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.400
terms?

32
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.900
Not only should it cause you to think differently.

33
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.100
Did you also see how it should change the way we live?

34
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.400
If this is who we are should it not change the way we live.

35
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
That's actually the one thing we need to be reminded of today.

36
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.500
Like first Peter 2 said that Jesus makes those who believe in him

37
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.000
a holy nation.

38
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.200
So let's act like it.

39
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.600
Jesus makes us as Believers a holy nation.

40
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.200
So let's act like it.

41
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.300
That's what we're going to see in Micah chapter 5 today. So turn

42
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.000
there with me if you're not there already.

43
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.500
Micah chapter 5

44
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.100
we're journeying straight through this book and last Sunday. Remember we

45
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.900
saw who the Messiah was going to be.

46
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.200
Christmas in October that that this eternal Good

47
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.000
Shepherd was going to be born in Bethlehem, and he was going to

48
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.500
come to bring peace and to be our very peace.

49
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.600
Well today we'll see as those people heard that message. They

50
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.800
they knew that was still future so they had to wait.

51
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.000
And what we'll see today is what they were to do as they

52
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.100
waited how they should trust that Yahweh

53
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.000
Messiah.

54
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.100
What they had to do is they waited.

55
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.500
This is Micah 5 starting in verse 5. We say it's verse

56
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.200
5 b second line down through the end of

57
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.000
verse 15.

58
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.200
It says when the Assyrian comes into our land and shreds in

59
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.500
our palaces, then we'll raise against him Seven Shepherds and eight

60
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.000
princes of men.

61
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.300
And they shall Shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword with the

62
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.300
land of nimrod at its entrances and he shall deliver

63
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.500
us from the Assyrian when he comes into our land and Treads within

64
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.000
our border.

65
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.400
Then the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples like

66
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.100
do from the Lord like showers on the

67
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.100
grass, which delay not for a man nor wait for the children of

68
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.400
man.

69
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.500
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations in the

70
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.700
midst of many people's.

71
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.200
Like a lion among the beasts of the forest like a young

72
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.500
lion among the flocks of sheep, which when it goes through Treads down

73
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.200
and tears and pieces and there's none to deliver.

74
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.300
Your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries and all

75
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.600
your enemies shall be cut off.

76
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.400
And in that day declares the Lord I will cut off your horses from

77
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.300
among you and destroy your chariots. I will cut off

78
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.600
the cities of your land and throw down your strongholds. I

79
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.000
will cut off sorceries from your hand and you shall have no more

80
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.200
tellers of Fortunes.

81
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.100
And I will cut off your carved images and your pillars from

82
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.600
among you.

83
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.100
And you shall bow down no more.

84
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.300
To the work of your hands.

85
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.600
And I will root out your Asher images from among you and

86
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.800
destroy your cities.

87
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.600
And in anger and wrath I will execute Vengeance on

88
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.300
the Nations that did not obey.

89
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.200
This is the word of the Lord.

90
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.400
So God, we pray that you would open our eyes to understand it.

91
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.100
To apply it to our lives not just

92
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.400
to look at it as a theological textbook but to understand what

93
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.000
you're trying to say even to us today. Help us see that

94
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.900
with our hearts.

95
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.100
And change our lives.

96
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.600
Jesus name we pray.

97
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.200
amen

98
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.300
And so as they waited for this Messiah to come they had

99
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.800
to trust yahwe to do a few things.

100
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.200
They had to trust that he was going to do a few things as they

101
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.500
waited. Well, what were the things they waited for? Well first

102
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.300
they trusted him to deliver his people

103
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.600
first.

104
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.700
to deliver his people

105
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.300
That's what Micah was declaring here this deliverance from

106
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.200
these Assyrians trying to overtake Judah they were they were coming

107
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.200
into the land and and that they trusted Yahweh would deliver

108
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.100
them in his time and his way and they knew

109
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.400
it was gonna be God who did that?

110
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.300
Because what did we just come off of the last

111
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.000
five verses right this idea of a messiah

112
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.300
the strong Shepherd in verses 2

113
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.600
through 5. God was going to be this verse 6

114
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.700
deliver. He would be the one to deliver

115
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.700
his people.

116
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.800
That's even what he's saying here with these Seven Shepherds and eight princes.

117
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.300
It's evidence that God is going to provide more than

118
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300
enough power to overcome the enemy because in

119
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.100
Hebrew writings, that's how it would work if they say a number and then

120
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.500
repeat a one step higher or a larger number. It

121
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.700
shows that it's just illustrating enough sufficiency.

122
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.600
So God says I'm going to give you enough power to overcome.

123
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.500
So even though they're facing the grave danger a

124
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.600
syrians coming in their land. They knew what they couldn't fight them themselves.

125
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.500
They could trust Yahweh would deliver them in his

126
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.700
time his way with his power.

127
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.200
So they waited for deliverance, but they also waited and

128
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.400
they trusted Yahweh in that waiting to bless all people.

129
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.000
deliver them

130
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.500
and bless all people.

131
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.300
To bless the Nations through them. That's what

132
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.100
they were waiting and trusting him to do look again at verse

133
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.200
7.

134
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.500
Says the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples like

135
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.500
do from the Lord showers on the grass, which delay not

136
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.900
for man nor wait for the children of man.

137
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.500
Now as you read commentators and Scholars,

138
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.100
there's some debate over this section right here how to read

139
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.000
it. Well and I agree. It's pretty tricky had to spend some time

140
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.100
on it. But the best I can understand is what they're talking about here is positive.

141
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.300
What Micah says here is a positive thing? Because every time do and

142
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.400
showers from the Lord appear in God's

143
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.800
word. It's a positive thing.

144
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.300
Like for those who receive it it's refreshing. It's a good

145
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.000
thing to have do and showers.

146
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.400
so somehow

147
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.700
even though this remnant of God's people would be scattered

148
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.600
among the nations in Exile.

149
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.700
They were still gonna bless the nations in the midst of that.

150
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.700
It's not the first time we see this.

151
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.400
It's actually Jeremiah 29 verses 5 through

152
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.400
7. We're he's speaking to the Exiles in Babylon what

153
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.400
they were to do while they're in Exile

154
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.800
says this

155
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.000
Jeremiah 29:5-7 build houses

156
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.600
and live in them plant Gardens

157
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.300
eat their produce take wives have sons and daughters

158
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.200
take wives for your sons. Give your daughters in marriage that they may

159
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.600
bear Sons and Daughters multiply there.

160
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.800
Do not decrease.

161
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.500
But seek the welfare of the city in which I

162
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.200
have sent you into exile.

163
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.500
And pray to the Lord on its behalf for in

164
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.400
its welfare. You will find your welfare.

165
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.200
Now just in a few verses later God promised us to deliver

166
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.400
them after 70 years. He's going to bring it back to their land. But while

167
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.000
they waited.

168
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.500
While they were waiting for deliverance, they were to live and bless

169
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.500
their neighbors.

170
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.900
Even there in Exile.

171
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.600
They were to be a blessing which is really a continuation of God's covenant

172
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.300
with Abraham back in Genesis 12. He said you're gonna be a blessing

173
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.200
to all the families of the earth. It tracks through all the

174
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.500
way to God's people being a blessing to All Nations.

175
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.400
But just think about that for a second, that's a tough ask, right.

176
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.900
I mean, they're in a hostile culture. Everything is against

177
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.100
Yahweh different practices different culture. That's

178
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.300
why verse 7 ended with this phrase about delaying and

179
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.200
waiting. That's one of the complicated parts of this.

180
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.700
It doesn't delay. It doesn't wait for the children a man. What Micah meant

181
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.500
here. Is that just like you cannot make do

182
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.200
or Reign? Come on the Earth?

183
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.700
You can't do this either.

184
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.300
Do and rain is God's job the same thing

185
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.100
with this only he can do this through you as well.

186
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.000
It seems impossible to be a blessing while in

187
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.300
Exile

188
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.300
And hostile culture it's very difficult. So you

189
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.500
got to trust God to do it.

190
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.900
Got to trust God to do it through you.

191
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.700
So they were waiting and trusting God to be a blessing to

192
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.900
others.

193
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.200
But do you remember what verse 8 said of Micah 5

194
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.800
it wasn't all blessing for those around them, right?

195
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.500
Yes there to be a blessing but as the remnant is scattered.

196
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.000
God will actually bring judgment.

197
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.500
as well

198
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.200
In fact, he uses this illustration of a lion with

199
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.600
sheep and he uses that to say he will condemn some

200
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:13.800
people.

201
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.500
Yeah, they're gonna be a blessing as they go and they're going to bless the

202
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.000
Nations. Yes, but

203
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.500
there's also going to be judgment. He's going to condemn some verse

204
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.300
9 Micah says to God the tent

205
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.900
says to God that your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries

206
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.400
your enemies.

207
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.600
It's a Victorious language verse 15. God says I will execute

208
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.800
judge Vengeance on the nation's.

209
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.100
So yes blessing but also judgment, but

210
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.500
don't think revenge.

211
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.500
The word vengeance is so close to Revenge. We think immediately

212
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.200
that God's taken revenge on his enemies. No, this is

213
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.500
the the idea of the wording here is that this is like a leader protecting

214
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.100
his people by getting rid

215
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.900
of the troublemakers and those who are slaying his people even

216
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.300
in the land.

217
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.300
Like so this is a positive idea that he's saying I'm

218
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.900
to protect my people.

219
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.600
Your trouble your trouble get out.

220
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.000
That's the idea of these vengeance is coming.

221
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.900
And that's been a consistent theme throughout Micah, right?

222
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.100
That there are people who are not.

223
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.200
Following Yahweh. They're turning their backs on God. They don't

224
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.400
listen and they don't obey and they're going to be judged by

225
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.400
that doesn't matter what the name on their their name plate

226
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.800
is it's still judgment is coming.

227
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.800
And so the remnant had to wait on Yahweh to bring that Justice, right?

228
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.400
God repeatedly says over and over I'm going to be the one to judge.

229
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.100
I'm going to judge. I'm going to judge.

230
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.200
in his time and his way he would bring that but they had

231
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.900
to have confidence that he was going to

232
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.200
because they see what you see right? They

233
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.100
see what what Carnage was happening around them as they were

234
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.100
oppressing the poor and and favoring the rich and Injustice all

235
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.400
over the place and they were looking at it like God do something.

236
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.700
and he says I'm going to

237
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.200
that's part of what they're waiting on here. But there's

238
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.000
there's something else they're waiting on here.

239
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.500
The verses 10 through 14 show us that they're

240
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.200
waiting and trusting God to do one more

241
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.100
thing in this.

242
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.700
That he would purify his people.

243
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.600
It kind of goes with what we just talked about this judgment on those even in

244
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.100
the in the land who were Injustice in

245
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.400
their life. And so here they're waiting

246
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.700
on God to purify his people purify them.

247
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.300
Look at verses 10 through 14 again.

248
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.700
In that day again that's referring to the day

249
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.200
of the Messiah in that day declares the Lord. I will

250
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.300
cut off your horses from among you destroy your chariots cut off

251
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.800
the cities of your land throw down your strongholds cut off sorceries from

252
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.200
your hand. No more tellers of Fortunes cut off

253
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.100
a carved images your pillars bow down no more

254
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.300
to the work of your hands. I'll root out your Astra images destroy your

255
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.000
cities. Did you see

256
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.800
How many times it said I will I will I

257
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.300
will God is saying that to his people

258
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.400
nine times. He says I will do this. I will

259
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.800
do this God is talking to his people verse

260
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.500
15. He talks to the Nations said vengeance is

261
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.600
coming to you. But in these verses he says I will

262
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.700
do this and I will do this.

263
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.500
In verse 9. He says I'm gonna cut off my enemies

264
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.400
here in verses 10 through 14. He

265
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.000
says I'm going to cut off all of these things.

266
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.100
in his people

267
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.300
And he lists out all these things. So think about what this would have

268
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.700
meant to his people to those who are hearing this.

269
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.000
He says horses and chariots.

270
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.100
That signified military might that they

271
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.000
were trusting in.

272
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.600
The cities and the strongholds would illustrate

273
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.700
this this engineering ingenuity.

274
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.500
That they had because they were having these thick walls.

275
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.100
They were safe because of their their minds.

276
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.200
The sorceries the fortune tellers the carved images

277
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.600
the ashra pillars.

278
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.700
It's all just wrapped around this idea of false religions

279
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.300
and Idols that they were trusting in.

280
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.300
And so what God is saying here they had to hear this what God

281
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.500
is saying is he was about to comb through their nation and

282
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.900
make them holy again.

283
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.600
They had all these other things they were trusting and all these other idols.

284
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.200
And God says I'm about to make you holy again

285
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.200
because remember that's what they were intended to be, right.

286
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.100
That's what they were supposed to be. It's from the

287
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.300
Covenant God initiated with Moses and with his people

288
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.400
on the Mount Sinai back in Exodus 19.

289
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.600
This is Verses 4 through 6. Listen to What God Says You

290
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.200
yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians how

291
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.800
I bore You On Eagle's Wings brought you to myself.

292
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.400
Now therefore if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my

293
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:14.800
Covenant.

294
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.200
You shall be my treasured possession among all

295
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.100
peoples for all the Earth is mine.

296
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.400
And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests?

297
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.100
and a holy nation

298
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.700
it sounds a whole like what I started with in First Peter 2, right. Do

299
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.900
you think where we got that now, huh?

300
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.400
But this was God's whole point in choosing Israel

301
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.500
to be his people was to set them apart and

302
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.900
say this is different.

303
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.400
This is who I am by looking at this group of

304
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:47.700
people.

305
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.200
But the whole book of Micah has shown us that they failed to

306
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.400
live like that. They began to live

307
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.000
just like the rest of the world.

308
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.600
They began to look not distinct not

309
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.700
set apart and look just like everyone else even

310
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.200
verse 13 says they're bowing down to the

311
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.900
work of their own hands.

312
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.800
How futile is that?

313
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.600
and so Messiah when Messiah comes

314
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.100
like the the water filter in your fridge, he's going to

315
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.400
start purifying out all the junk that's going to destroy you.

316
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.300
So that you can live like he wants you to live.

317
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.400
So you can be holy you can be set apart. That's

318
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.000
what his intention was.

319
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.800
But the question then comes forward to us.

320
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.100
So that's what God was saying to them. That was

321
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.800
what they were waiting for in the kingdom of God that was coming. This

322
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.400
is what it would look like as God would come but

323
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.300
what about us today?

324
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.800
Really, aren't we doing much the same thing?

325
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.400
In you know, we'll get to some of the things that we're doing. But but aren't we

326
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.600
in the same boat here? Because because think about how we're waiting.

327
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.200
This Messiah is still in some

328
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.400
way future. Yes, the kingdom has already come in Jesus,

329
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.000
but he has not yet. Come to fully complete

330
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.400
his kingdom.

331
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.300
So we're in this waiting game. We're in between we're looking forward

332
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.400
to something. That's still future. You might

333
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.500
say we are still an exile.

334
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.400
That we are not home yet.

335
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.300
This has great or as poor as it

336
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.800
is is not home for us.

337
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.700
God is still coming back one day to take us home. He's

338
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.700
preparing a place for us that we might be in his

339
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.300
Promised Land again.

340
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.300
And so the question then is how do we live out these

341
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.100
principles today?

342
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.500
If we can kind of take a bit of a parallel between them and

343
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.000
us today, how do we live this out then?

344
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.300
How do we take steps forward to

345
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.600
apply Micah 5?

346
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.600
To our lives today.

347
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.500
How do we wait you might ask?

348
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.100
Well, here's how we do it first.

349
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.700
Like Judah remember was supposed to be due and rain showers

350
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.200
for the Nations around them even among hostile

351
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.700
Nations while they were in Exile.

352
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.300
We also are to bless

353
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.100
others as we wait for full Deliverance in Jesus.

354
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.000
How do we wait?

355
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.600
How do we how do we wait like they had to wait for

356
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.600
the Messiah? Well first we bless others.

357
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.100
Just like this we bless others.

358
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.100
Now I was trying to think of some examples of this think of the

359
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:53.800
first church.

360
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.100
Acts 2 Church began, what did they

361
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.900
do? Because they were not in a friendly area. It's

362
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.900
very hostile the place they were living they

363
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.600
were threatened with death repeatedly, but what

364
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.000
did they do?

365
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.500
They were loving people healing people they were

366
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.300
providing for widows. They were taking an orphans. They

367
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.200
were walking in when the plagues happened while everybody else was

368
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.600
walking out. They were blessing the people that they

369
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.600
lived around even as the hostility came

370
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:25.900
in.

371
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.500
And so think but but also think about the last

372
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.300
2,000 years since then.

373
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.500
And I know the church has a pretty checkered past as we look back

374
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.000
at those two thousand years, but think how many schools and

375
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.600
hospitals and social agencies

376
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.200
have been started by the church churches.

377
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.000
and so we hear this we as God's

378
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.900
Believing. Holy nation his holy people.

379
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.300
We are not meant to run

380
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.300
away from the world around us.

381
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.100
We are to bless the world around us as

382
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.600
much as we possibly can.

383
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.200
Remember Jeremiah 29. They're an exile that Micah 5

384
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.400
you're going to be an exile. You're gonna be do you're gonna be Showers of

385
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.600
rain. We have to think like ambassadors to

386
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.600
a foreign Nation.

387
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.200
Because this is not home. We're in a foreign Nation right

388
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.500
now. And so we have the the thought process like

389
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.700
an ambassador which by the way God has graciously compassionately

390
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.900
called us to be

391
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.200
Like what an honor that is, right?

392
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.300
To be called an ambassador of the kingdom of God called by the

393
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.300
king himself to be your representative to

394
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.400
a foreign Nation.

395
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.900
What is an ambassador do?

396
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.100
remember an ambassador is supposed to remain unstained by

397
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.300
the negative parts of that country that they're going

398
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:54.800
to

399
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.300
Right, they're not to get immersed into it and and be taken away

400
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.200
from the principles of their home country. They're not supposed

401
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.300
to do that. They're supposed to stay away in some

402
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.700
sense separated from it.

403
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.600
But also

404
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.900
they are to bring the best parts of their home country to

405
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.300
bear on the new country, right?

406
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.700
It's an ambassador. Does that's us to

407
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.900
the World Church?

408
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.500
We are to bless the world around

409
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.500
us to take the kingdom principles and

410
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.100
apply them to our lives as much as we can.

411
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.200
That's one way we can wait.

412
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.500
On God's full Kingdom to come as we're in this Exile. We

413
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.500
wait for him. We also wait in that

414
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.400
by putting our trust in Yahweh.

415
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.000
Just like they had to

416
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.800
we rely on Yahweh to

417
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.200
do what he's promised to do.

418
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.500
It's called Trust.

419
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.200
And that's what that is. It's a Reliance that God you've

420
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.500
said you're going to do this. So I'm trusting you're going to it's trusting him.

421
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.900
And so as we're in this Exile this hostile hostile

422
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.000
world.

423
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.100
What do we do when we're threatened?

424
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.300
They were pressed in on every side. What are we to do

425
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.200
when we are pressed in with evil forces around us do

426
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:20.500
we fight?

427
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.000
Do we hide?

428
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.600
Listen to how Romans 12.

429
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.400
verses 14 through 21 says

430
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.500
we are to do it bless those who persecute you.

431
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.700
Bless and do not curse them.

432
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.100
Rejoice with those who Rejoice weep with those

433
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.500
who weep live in harmony with one another do not be prideful but

434
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.000
associate with the lowly

435
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.600
never be wise in your own sight.

436
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.200
Repay, no one evil for evil.

437
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.500
But give thought to do what is Honorable in the sight of all.

438
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.300
if possible so far as it depends on you live peaceably with

439
00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:58.500
all

440
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.600
Beloved never avenge yourselves but

441
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.700
leave it to the wrath of God for it is written vengeance

442
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.000
is mine. I will repay says the Lord.

443
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.700
To the contrary if your enemy is hungry feed

444
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:12.800
him.

445
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.200
If he's thirsty give him something to drink for by so doing

446
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.200
you'll keep burning coals on his head.

447
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.500
And do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with

448
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.100
good.

449
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.600
See if we remember that vengeance is not ours.

450
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.300
It's God's.

451
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.500
That's how then we're able to bless.

452
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.500
That's how we're able to rejoice and weep with

453
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.900
people who don't believe what we believe.

454
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.400
That's how we're able to walk humbly to not take

455
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.700
revenge to give food and water to our enemies

456
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.300
to overcome evil with good. That's how we do

457
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.100
it because we know we're trusting God to make it.

458
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.800
All right that's wrong right now.

459
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.600
We're trusting God to make all that is wrong right at

460
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.300
some point now. Yes, we're agents of that at times

461
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.500
but we are never to do that with vengeance in

462
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:05.900
our hearts.

463
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:08.600
Because it's his.

464
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.200
It's trusting God the way of

465
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.400
the Cross is utterly different than the way of the world.

466
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.600
Is trusting him to work it out.

467
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.300
Not try to work it out ourselves.

468
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.000
But there's one more.

469
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.200
We started with the main

470
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:31.800
point today.

471
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.500
How we wait is also by seeking holiness.

472
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.300
We seek holiness.

473
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.400
again, if God has made us

474
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.600
As his people a holy nation his holy people.

475
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.300
Then let's act like it.

476
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.800
Let's be different like that.

477
00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.700
I started with first Peter 2 verses 9 and 10. He continues

478
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.600
in verses 11 and 12 listen to this.

479
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.200
He says beloved, I urge you as sojourners and

480
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.800
exiles.

481
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.400
We are Exiles I urge you to abstain from the

482
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.400
passions of the flesh.

483
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.100
Which wage war against your soul?

484
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.000
Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable.

485
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.600
So that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may

486
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.000
see your good deeds and glorify God on the

487
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.300
day of visitation.

488
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:33.600
You see that?

489
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.500
It's not so they glorify you. It's so they glorify God they see you

490
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.300
live differently.

491
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.400
For the sake of God's glory.

492
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.800
Okay. So seek Holiness a very broad term very large bucket.

493
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.500
How do we do that?

494
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.600
Well, Micah 5 shows us a few things.

495
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.800
That we seek holiness.

496
00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.800
first by not seeking worldly power

497
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.800
Micah 5 says seek Holiness not worldly power.

498
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.200
Remember what Judah was trusting in?

499
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.100
The things God was stripping away as he combed through

500
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.000
the nation. What was they trusting in first? They were trusting in their military strength

501
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.700
the size of their City walls, right?

502
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.200
They were trusting in these things to protect them from the

503
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.000
enemy not God himself to protect them.

504
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.600
We Face similar Temptations every day, don't we?

505
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200
Do we feel secure?

506
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.200
In our lives merely because our nation spends the most

507
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.000
on the military and the police force.

508
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.200
And that's why we feel safe.

509
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.500
or this

510
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.800
do we get consumed by laws and Supreme Court

511
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.400
Justices and political victories as

512
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.400
if those things are going to control the future.

513
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.500
It's trusting our own power instead of trusting God.

514
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.800
I'm not saying those things are bad. I'm saying those things become

515
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.600
the source of our comfort and our security.

516
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.700
Now you might be sitting there thinking about this and like well, well the world is Raging

517
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.300
against us shouldn't the church Fight Fire With Fire?

518
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.500
I completely agree with you.

519
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.200
It's just that the fire with which the church fights is

520
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.300
the fire of prayer fasting serving humility.

521
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.400
Loving our enemies generosity refusing

522
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.300
to retaliate carrying our crosses.

523
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.400
Because second Corinthians 10:4 says the weapons of our Warfare are

524
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.400
not of the flesh but have divine power

525
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.500
to destroy strongholds.

526
00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.200
See man-made fire.

527
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.000
Will just end up burning the house down.

528
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.500
But holy spirit fire is true fire that will actually purify.

529
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.500
And so are we to fight? Yes, we are

530
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.700
to fight but we fight with the weapons of Jesus we fight

531
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.400
with the weapons of the Kingdom. That's how a

532
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.500
holy people shows itself distinct.

533
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.300
That's what Psalm 20:7 says so well

534
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.300
some trust in chariots some in horses,

535
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.600
but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.

536
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.300
nothing else

537
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.200
No worldly power. We ultimately trust

538
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.300
in We Trust In Our God

539
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.500
Yahweh.

540
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.700
So we seek Holiness not.

541
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.100
Worldly power it's second from Micah 5.

542
00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.400
We learn we seek Holiness not false religion.

543
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.500
Seek Holiness not false religion. It's all

544
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.400
over the Book of Micah. We've seen it and really it's all over the God's word

545
00:28:59.400 --> 00:28:59.900
as a whole.

546
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.300
That people humans like you and me. We have a terrible

547
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.900
habit towards syncretism.

548
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.100
And what that word means is that it's it's just where we

549
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.400
make up our own religious activity by taking

550
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.500
a little bit of this and a little bit of that and and a

551
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.500
little bit of Yahweh and it's all put together for good measure.

552
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.200
The problem is that fundamental to our faith.

553
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.600
Fundamental to every part of

554
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.300
our faith from Genesis all the way through the end is

555
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.800
the worship of one God.

556
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.100
The one God who is delivered us from slavery Israel.

557
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.600
Literally from Exodus us from sin.

558
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.300
The one God Exodus 20 the very first

559
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.900
commandment. He says you shall have no other gods besides

560
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:49.000
me.

561
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.700
No mixing. No compromising one

562
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.300
God.

563
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.100
And you might be like sitting there thinking. Okay. Well, I got that one

564
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.000
settled man. That's not me.

565
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.400
I'm not worshiping these other gods. I've got that one taken care

566
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:04.500
of.

567
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.000
Be careful.

568
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.100
Because the enemy is really subtle.

569
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.000
And he might slip in some deception where you're

570
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.300
blending in false religions with Christianity.

571
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.700
Where you take you take a little of this Hindu

572
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:24.800
thought?

573
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.300
and a little of this Buddhist thought

574
00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.700
a little this Karma and some automatic riding

575
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.200
over here and some some new age mysticism over here

576
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.000
and you sprinkle some Jesus on top of it you call it good.

577
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.100
listen, that's

578
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:42.800
dangerous

579
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.700
That's why we must.

580
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.100
Just hold fast to the word of God the essential nature

581
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.300
of God's word that we align our

582
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.200
practices and our beliefs with what it says first.

583
00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.300
Because there's stuff you're hearing all the time that's gonna be contradictory to that

584
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.100
even though it sounds right.

585
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.800
Because when you make a God in your own image.

586
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.700
When you make a God in your own image what you're comfortable

587
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.300
with that's false religion. Just as much as anything else

588
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:13.700
is.

589
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.100
Here's a question I've asked.

590
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.600
of my own heart

591
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.200
if your conscience is Never pricked by the

592
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.300
Jesus you worship.

593
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.200
Then it's not the true Jesus. You're actually worshiping.

594
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.100
right if it's never

595
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.400
confront if you're always okay, if you're always right, that's not

596
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:37.700
Jesus.

597
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.700
Because you're not like him yet.

598
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.300
He's got work to do in your heart. You're still in the flesh is

599
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.600
still there, right? So you have things that he's going to confront

600
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.100
you on he's going to convict you of if it never happens.

601
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.900
Check where you're actually trusting in.

602
00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.300
He has called us to be holy people his his possession

603
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.100
his holy people so we have

604
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.400
to purge ourselves of everything that would paint

605
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.500
that picture of separateness.

606
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:08.600
in the world

607
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.800
or does it just look like everybody else?

608
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.800
But I thought as I was looking at Micah 5, I I thought we

609
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.400
could take a double click on that false religion idea and

610
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.500
take it a level deeper.

611
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.600
And get to a thought that I think maybe maybe

612
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.000
hits us a little more directly.

613
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.200
That we must seek holiness.

614
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.100
not cultural Christianity

615
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.400
as we wait for this Messiah

616
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.000
to fully come

617
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.800
we must seek Holiness set apartness not

618
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.500
cultural Christianity.

619
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.500
Let me Define that before we go any further, so we're not confused what

620
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:57.700
we're talking about.

621
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.000
a cultural Christian

622
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.800
would be someone who might go through the motions with

623
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.100
the title Christian.

624
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.900
But does not truly adhere to the faith. He

625
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.100
is not their lord.

626
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.700
Even if they say he's their savior.

627
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.700
It's often based on family background or even

628
00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.400
location that you live. That's just that's what everybody does.

629
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.500
It's kind of like we saw with Judah a couple weeks ago that

630
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.600
they stood up and said we're okay. We're

631
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.300
we're fine with God why because the temple is

632
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.600
right here. We live right next to the temple. So clearly

633
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.600
we're okay with God just by our location.

634
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.200
It's a similar issue with this cultural Christianity and

635
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.500
really the core issue of this.

636
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.600
Goes to Micah 5 verse 15 where he's

637
00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.600
talking about judging Nations, who do not obey.

638
00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.900
That's the fundamental issue here

639
00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.400
a lack of obedience. It's the

640
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.500
same thing second Thessalonians. 1:8 says that at

641
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.300
the Lord's return he will bring Vengeance on those who do not

642
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.200
know God and on those who do not obey the

643
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.600
gospel of our Lord Jesus.

644
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.600
She listen when we talk about being a Christian.

645
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.900
It's not just a label to apply to your life.

646
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.400
Like OSU Alum or engineer or athlete or

647
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.200
whatever else we're talking about a life-changing

648
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.900
Faith here.

649
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.500
See, this is not just a social club to join for

650
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.700
benefits and for friends. Jesus calls

651
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.300
us to come and die to ourselves.

652
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.300
And here's why this is such a big problem in our world right

653
00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.800
now because cultural Christianity causes the world to lose

654
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.900
its picture of who Jesus really is.

655
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.600
Because the church in general looks no

656
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.100
different than the rest of the world does.

657
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.800
divorce rate same

658
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.200
drunkenness is prevalent.

659
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.300
pornography's rampant

660
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.200
abuse is covered up.

661
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.100
Our words on the golf course are very different than the

662
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.100
words. We used in church.

663
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.200
We freely accept sin as if it's no big deal and even

664
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.200
changing our beliefs to to comfort those who are

665
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:35.800
sinning.

666
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.700
some of the most terrifying scriptures

667
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.800
Are found in Verses?

668
00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.500
21 through 23 of Matthew 7

669
00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.700
where Jesus says not everyone who

670
00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.300
says to me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of

671
00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:55.600
heaven.

672
00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.600
But the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven.

673
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.800
On that day same day. We're talking about many will

674
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.600
say to me Lord. Did we not prophesy in

675
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.200
your name? Do we not cast out demons in your name and

676
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.600
do many mighty works in your name? Did we not look like a believer?

677
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.100
And I will declare to them.

678
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:18.900
I never knew you.

679
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.400
Depart from me you workers of lawlessness.

680
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.300
It's terrifying.

681
00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.300
to think

682
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.600
That you can look like a Believer the entire.

683
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.700
entirety of your life

684
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.400
playing some religious game and

685
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.200
he looks at you on that day and says, I don't know who you are.

686
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.600
I've never had a relationship with you.

687
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.900
You never gave me your life.

688
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.000
So Hear Me friends if this is you if you're playing some religious

689
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.400
game in all of this just stop doing it

690
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.500
if this is some hobby for you stop

691
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.200
It's a terrible hobby. You could waste your life doing this.

692
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.500
You might as well if this is just a game you might as well go play

693
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.400
golf or go to the the lake or whatever else. It doesn't matter. What

694
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.500
you need to do is instead of just mentally agreeing with

695
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.700
some factual information about Jesus. You

696
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.500
need to die to yourself repent and believe in

697
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:21.700
Jesus.

698
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.300
You can't be good enough.

699
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.200
You can't be religious enough to earn your

700
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.200
salvation. You need Mercy.

701
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.300
Because on our own hear me on our own you and I

702
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.200
are do the Vengeance of God

703
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.700
because we have not obeyed him.

704
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.400
And so verse 15 said every one of us none of us have obeyed him.

705
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.500
And so we're do the Vengeance of God, but Mercy.

706
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.200
Mercy means he does not give you what you deserve.

707
00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:58.100
Because Jesus.

708
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.100
Took that penalty for you on the cross.

709
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.500
He took the wrath of God the Vengeance of God on

710
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.500
the cross in your place. If you repent and believe in

711
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.200
him, he saves you. That's the kind

712
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.700
of Fate hear me. That's the kind of faith that changes you.

713
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.100
I get it. I lived it for 20 years.

714
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.800
To try to to have this this good

715
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.200
enough life and to sprinkle Jesus on

716
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.900
top of everything. I was wanting to do myself. I get that and it's fruitless.

717
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.100
It's exhausting.

718
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.000
This is the kind of faith that changes us

719
00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.500
that leads you to then abstain from

720
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.300
the passions of the flesh to live in a way that glorifies God.

721
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.400
That's what faith truly does.

722
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.100
What that means is you don't have to clean it up before you come to

723
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:52.400
Jesus.

724
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.500
Like don't hear me say that you have to earn your way that you have to obey

725
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.600
where he's not going to love you. No you obey because he already loves

726
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:01.700
you.

727
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.300
He makes you he makes you I will I will

728
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.500
I he makes you a holy nation Church.

729
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.300
He makes you a holy person one who

730
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.300
set apart and so in that receive it.

731
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.800
Receive it and act like it because of the Gospel.

732
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.000
In light of God's mercy towards Sinners Like You and Me.

733
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.400
And with God's Spirit dwelling inside of us. Let's

734
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.600
be his set apart ambassadors.

735
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.100
For his glory not for ours. Let's show the world.

736
00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:41.700
This is who God is.
