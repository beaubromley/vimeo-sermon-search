00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.000
here

2
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.900
if

3
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.300
Well, good morning again church. It's an honor to get

4
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.500
to do this most every week to preach the word and

5
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.400
to Pastor. I love doing it. So I

6
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.100
look back over the last four years and can see how much I've grown through

7
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.400
a lot of trial and a lot of God's work in that but also

8
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400
do to a lot of your encouragement. And so thank

9
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.500
you again for that. If you are new to our church, we'd

10
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.200
love to meet you. So just come say hello up here

11
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.300
after or out the info desk. We just want to get to know you and care for

12
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.600
you as best we can.

13
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.600
So come say hello.

14
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.200
As we get into this today, though.

15
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.800
I have a deep concern about where we live.

16
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.200
About where I even grew up up in Northwest Oklahoma in

17
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
the Buckle of what would be called the Bible

18
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.500
Belt that we often refer to?

19
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.400
see many of you have heard my testimony where I grew up in an

20
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.700
environment where there were thankfully a lot of solid followers

21
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700
of Christ that were there, but there was also

22
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.200
an accepted level of what we

23
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.200
would call cultural Christianity.

24
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.800
Where people just kind of going through the motions but not

25
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.800
really changed.

26
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.600
Having the right answers to the questions, but where Jesus is mostly

27
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600
just fire insurance for eternity.

28
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.900
Maybe even some kind of moral encouragement or decency that

29
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.800
you would want to live.

30
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.200
But it's wrong is that culture is many of us I think

31
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.300
can identify with that.

32
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.400
That's where we have been.

33
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.700
But it's wrong as that culture is what that can breed

34
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.400
in US.

35
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.600
Is is an arrogance toward others?

36
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.300
where we we look down on others who don't

37
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.700
have it all together like we claim to have

38
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.700
or we we begin to create this class system,

39
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.800
where where you you exclude others

40
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800
who don't have the right background or the right lifestyle

41
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.400
or the right? Whatever they're not

42
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.200
worthy of our love.

43
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.200
or God's love

44
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.200
Yet the whole time that is happening. That first

45
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.200
group just assumes that they're okay with

46
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.400
God.

47
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600
That we're right with God.

48
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.600
And thinking that that second group.

49
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.500
no chance of getting in

50
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.300
The parable we're going to study today as they

51
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.000
all have done so far will continue to separate.

52
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.300
Those who are humbly looking for God's kingdom to come.

53
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.600
From those who are self-righteous and selfish and creating

54
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.400
wrong barriers.

55
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.200
So we're gonna learn from this Parable that at God's table eternally

56
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.200
God's table in fellowship with God the expected

57
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.500
are absent.

58
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.300
while the unexpected or present

59
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.000
that's the idea. We're going to see today in the parable. Is that that at Eternal

60
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.200
table God's table?

61
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.700
The expected are actually absent but the unexpected.

62
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.900
present

63
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.700
we'll see that in Luke chapter 14 today. So

64
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.700
take your copy of God's word turn there with me.

65
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.200
Luke 14 again put a bookmark in Luke

66
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.600
were in there all summer, of course.

67
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.100
Luke 14 and we'll get to the first part of it

68
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.200
before we get to the parable in a moment, but we've done this with

69
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.200
all the Parables so far is we need to study the context for why he

70
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.700
would tell it.

71
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.100
Well the context here in the first part of chapter 14 is that he

72
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.000
was telling this at a Sabbath feast.

73
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.300
So we'll see he's been invited to a feast on the

74
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.500
Sabbath. And so that was the context this sabbath Feast

75
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.800
where he was telling the parable will see a little bit later.

76
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.400
And meals back then were critically important

77
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.200
because it was a place that they would gather together to celebrate

78
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.300
or to praise God or to

79
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.400
honor someone or to pass along critical information

80
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.200
that needed to be shared.

81
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.400
So they throw a party big feast and here Jesus Takes the

82
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.500
context this part he's been invited to to share some

83
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.100
important information.

84
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.100
about eternity

85
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.800
And who is invited who gets in to the kingdom of God eternally?

86
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.400
But Jesus needed to prepare their hearts to hear it first. And so

87
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.700
that's we're going to see him confront some things in these religious leaders lives

88
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.200
that he's around.

89
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.700
The first thing he confronts is their religious traditions.

90
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.800
In this Feast he confronts their religious Traditions.

91
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.000
Look at verses 1 through 6 here.

92
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.400
One Sabbath when he went into dine at the house of a

93
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.300
ruler of the Pharisees. They were watching him carefully trying to

94
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.400
trap him usually and behold there was a man before him who

95
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.300
had drop scene now that's a condition where there's

96
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.200
too much fluid buildup in your joints and body and

97
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.200
just can't really function can't move very easily and so

98
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.300
it hindered your life.

99
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.500
And Jesus responded to the lawyers and the Pharisees

100
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.000
saying is it lawful to heal on the

101
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.900
Sabbath or not?

102
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.500
But they remain silent and he took him and healed him

103
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.400
and sent him away.

104
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.300
And he said to the leaders, which of you having a son or

105
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.800
an ox that's fallen into a well on a Sabbath day will not

106
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.600
immediately pull him out.

107
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.700
And they could not reply to these things.

108
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.900
Now before you come down too hard on the Pharisees.

109
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.100
Right Phil said this week like we tend to think of the

110
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.200
Pharisees like like Jafar from Aladdin right? Like just

111
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.100
the worst thing you could ever imagine. That's that's what we think of these guys.

112
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.400
But but honestly think about this they were trying to follow the law.

113
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.100
I was that was really the motivation. They didn't do it

114
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.600
well or perfectly but but it was it was an attempt

115
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.400
to follow God's law and even all the

116
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.200
way from the well-known Ten Commandments that God had

117
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.100
commanded no work on the Sabbath.

118
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.100
So that was in their mind. They're trying to figure out ways to obey that

119
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.600
not to disobey that they wanted to make sure they were on track with

120
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.500
that command at least one of them.

121
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.100
But their hearts were off as they were

122
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.700
trying to do that.

123
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.400
So why Jesus says what he says he says you would have broken

124
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.300
that command if your son fell in that well or if

125
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.200
an ox, you're source of income fell in that well, right

126
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.100
you you'd make sure you've pulled them out as fast as possible. It doesn't matter

127
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.900
if it's a Sabbath or not. You want to save their life?

128
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.300
So there was some way you'd break it right and here the

129
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.000
fact that they would not allow a healing on the Sabbath.

130
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.300
That this man could have been worked could have done a lot more with

131
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.500
his life could have lived life to the fullest then.

132
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.500
It showed their religious tradition.

133
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.400
over Road their compassion

134
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.000
it outweighed their compassion for people just to try to

135
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.700
follow the Traditions that they have.

136
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.900
So he confronted that then he also confronted their self-importance and

137
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.800
he's preparing their heart for the parable. We'll see confronted their

138
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.500
self-importance.

139
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.700
He'd watched what happened as they came into the feast and here's what he says

140
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.500
in response. Look at verses 7 through 11.

141
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.300
He gets to the Heart by saying a parable which by

142
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.200
the way this little confusing because the parable the wedding Feast is

143
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.500
what my Bible says. This is titled. It's actually not the parable worth studying

144
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.800
in a moment. So don't worry about that. This is a pre-parable. I

145
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.100
don't know. Okay, so he told a parable to those

146
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.500
who were invited when he noticed how they chose the places of Honor.

147
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.600
Saying to them when you were invited by someone to a wedding Feast Do not

148
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.600
sit down in a place of honor lest. Someone more distinguished than

149
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.200
you would be invited by him. He who invited you both will come

150
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.200
and say to you give your place to this person.

151
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.600
Then you'll begin with shame to take the lowest place.

152
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.300
But when you're invited go and sit in the lowest place so

153
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.800
that when your host comes he may say to you friend move up higher.

154
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.100
And you'll be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table

155
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.400
with you.

156
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.200
For everyone who exalts himself will be humble and he who

157
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.800
humbles himself will be exalted.

158
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.500
So to understand what he just said, we didn't understand what that Feast

159
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.200
would have been like.

160
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.200
The setup of it was like a head table like you

161
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.500
see a wedding. Sometimes now a head table where where the most important people

162
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.600
sit, right? Everybody's gonna look at them, but then it's staggered from

163
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.000
there ordered by distinguished or honored as

164
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.400
they would see as the host would see

165
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:39.700
fit.

166
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.400
And these Pharisees as they walked into Feast they

167
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.200
were jockeying for position because they wanted to sit at the head table or

168
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.700
sit up high because then they would show that they're distinguished that they're

169
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:50.900
honored.

170
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.300
But Jesus flipped that on its head said no. No,

171
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.000
actually you should humble yourself.

172
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.400
Instead of needing to be humbled when someone more

173
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.900
distinguished or more honored shows up.

174
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.300
Right because how awkward would it be?

175
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.600
For that that man sitting at the head table.

176
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.100
To be told no, actually we need your chair. We need

177
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.500
you to go sit in the corner.

178
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.100
The Walk of Shame awkwardness back as

179
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.500
everybody watches that happen.

180
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.200
But then think the reverse of that.

181
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.000
You go sit in the corner and you start there and you're just

182
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.700
like I'm content to be in the party. That's all I care about.

183
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.300
And the man who throw the party he says hey.

184
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.300
Come up here.

185
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.400
In front of everybody you get honored by walking this way.

186
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.600
to one of the head tables

187
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.400
How different that would be that's what Jesus's point was

188
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.100
the Pharisees thought they were special because of

189
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.700
who they were.

190
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.200
That they deserve to be at the head table. But

191
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.300
Jesus says no see yourself humbly. See yourself

192
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.600
actually how you are who you really are acknowledged that

193
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.700
start back here in the corner. And then

194
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.200
if you're going to be honored he'll do

195
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:07.300
it.

196
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.600
Don't be self-important.

197
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.700
Which led immediately to another confrontation similar vein

198
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.600
to that one. He confronted their social practices in

199
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.400
the same banquet setting.

200
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.400
their social practices

201
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.300
Not only should they not fight for position. They should also go

202
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.500
further and do this.

203
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.000
Look at verses 12 through 14.

204
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.500
He said also to the man who had invited him when you give a dinner

205
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.300
or a banquet do not invite your friends or your brothers or

206
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.500
your relatives or your Rich neighbors lest. They also invite you

207
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.100
in return and you be repaid.

208
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.100
But when you give a feast invite the poor the crippled the

209
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.500
lame the Blind and you will be blessed because they cannot repay

210
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:51.800
you.

211
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.500
For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the

212
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.200
just meaning the day Jesus returns.

213
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.200
Now here's what we can't read into this. Jesus was

214
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.500
not saying it's wrong to have friends.

215
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.100
He's just saying don't show Hospitality to people

216
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.200
so that you get paid back for it.

217
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.100
Instead what Jesus saying? Hey, you guys follow the law

218
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.000
right? You really want to follow the law. Remember Leviticus 19 says you

219
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.700
are to love your neighbor as yourself.

220
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.000
Are you really going to do that?

221
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.700
Because remember what love means.

222
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.100
Love is willing self-sacrifice for the

223
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.300
good of someone else even when they can't pay you back and

224
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.500
even when they don't deserve it.

225
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.800
So guys are you going to love your neighbor?

226
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.200
Including those who can't pay you back including those

227
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.100
who don't quote unquote deserve it.

228
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.600
Because they're remember they're practices. They're social practices

229
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.700
were based on what they could recoup.

230
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.200
I'm gonna throw this party to build up my reputation, but I know

231
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.100
they're going to do the same thing. So I'm gonna get to go to a party that I don't have

232
00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.300
to pay for.

233
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.700
I'm gonna get that repaid.

234
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.200
Instead. Jesus says no focus on the Lord focus on what he

235
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.300
wants focus on.

236
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.600
Caring and loving for people who can't ever pay

237
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.500
you back. That's just what he's done for us. It's something

238
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.200
honestly, I think we need to learn today just as a sidebar.

239
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.000
Who are you associating with? Who are you running towards and and kind of

240
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.300
lean in towards to make sure that you're seen in

241
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.500
some way or that you're gonna get paid back someday who

242
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.200
you hanging with?

243
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.900
Social practices he confronted leading into the next confrontation from

244
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.300
Jesus which sets then along with verse

245
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.100
14 what he said about the resurrection of the just it points to the

246
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.100
primary focus Jesus about to say in the parable.

247
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.300
Verse 15 this focus on eternity. Look at what it

248
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.200
says. He says one of those who reclined at the

249
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.300
table with him heard all of this as Jesus said and he said

250
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.200
to Jesus blessed is everyone who will eat

251
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.000
bread in the kingdom of God.

252
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.800
So imagine this devout Jewish man.

253
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.000
Sitting at this Feast seeking to

254
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.900
follow the law.

255
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.100
And and he looked around at this Feast with eternity

256
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.100
in his mind and he saw this and and in

257
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.200
the room he was in he saw a foretaste of

258
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:22.700
the Kingdom.

259
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.700
It's like look at all these faithful Jewish people around man.

260
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.200
This is what it's going to be like

261
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.700
That the Messiah would come someday and would restore Israel.

262
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.800
He would give us our land back and peace perfect

263
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.400
people like this is the way it's gonna be.

264
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.800
But that assumption he's making is based on a misunderstanding

265
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.700
about eternity.

266
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.200
See, that's what Jesus is about to confront here is a misunderstanding

267
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.700
about eternity.

268
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.200
That they didn't actually get it.

269
00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.100
They missed it.

270
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.200
And all of that that we've seen from verses 1

271
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.100
through 15 leads up to the parable. We're going

272
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.100
to study in a moment about eternity.

273
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.200
The story with a purpose look at verses 16 through 24 Jesus response

274
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.300
to this man to the whole setting he said to

275
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:18.500
him.

276
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.600
a man once gave a great banquet and invited many

277
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.400
And at the time for the banquet, he sent his servant to

278
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.500
say to those who had been invited come everything is now

279
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:29.600
ready.

280
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.400
But they all alike began to make excuses and

281
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.200
the first said to him. I've bought a field. I must go out and see

282
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.400
it. Please have me excused.

283
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.400
Another one said I bought five yoke of oxen. I must go examine

284
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.700
them. Please have me excused.

285
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.200
And another one said I've married a wife therefore. I cannot come.

286
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.600
So the servant came and reported these things to his master.

287
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.300
The Master of the House became angry and said to

288
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:54.900
his servant.

289
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.300
Go out quickly to the streets and Lanes of

290
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.300
the city and bring in the poor and the crippled and the Blind and the

291
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:01.500
lame.

292
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.700
So we assume at this point the servant goes and does that verse 22 the

293
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.000
servant said sir, what you commanded has been done.

294
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.300
And still there's room.

295
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.200
And the master said to the servant. Okay, go out to the

296
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.300
highways and hedges and compel people to come in that my house

297
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.500
may be filled.

298
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.100
For I tell you none of those men who

299
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.200
were invited shall taste my banquet.

300
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.000
Now we look at this Parable in light of

301
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.800
all that Jesus has confronted already in these Jewish leaders,

302
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.500
and we look at the principles of this parable.

303
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.600
And we need to understand what it's saying to us. What

304
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.500
is it teaching in light of everything we've seen so far.

305
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.300
Now here's a here's a concern a question. We have as we

306
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.500
study Parables every week.

307
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.200
How far do we go in in the

308
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.900
word is allegorizing these things and in taking these pieces

309
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.000
and say that means this and that means this and that means

310
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.300
it's how far do we go into that with each element? Some things

311
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.300
are very clear in what we know is obvious others

312
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.900
are less. So

313
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.000
and so we could go through this and we could try to make everything mean something.

314
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.200
But you have to remember the purpose of Parables. They're

315
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.400
not intended to be theological treatises.

316
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.300
Like statements on theology. These are

317
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.700
stories with the purpose of revealing the

318
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.700
nature of God's kingdom to us.

319
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.300
So our tendency is to try to dive into the weeds and try

320
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.000
to figure every little thing out. Don't miss the points that

321
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.300
Jesus is saying these words to that. It might

322
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.300
be pretty surface level initially.

323
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.200
Don't miss that though, because that's what Jesus is trying to get us to

324
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.500
see.

325
00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.600
And so we're gonna look at just the principles and what it says and we'll try to identify

326
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.400
what those things point forward to.

327
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.100
The first principle we see here is that the man's party was

328
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.900
prepared, right?

329
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.700
That's the first party. He'd finished preparing. He'd sent

330
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.700
out to save the date cards. And now it's finished right? He's sent

331
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.200
out the second invitation the real one.

332
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.400
Now I'd already said this was referring

333
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.600
to Eternity.

334
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.600
I believe it's referring to the wedding supper of the Lamb found

335
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.100
in Revelation 19 where Jesus reunites with

336
00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.400
his bride with the church.

337
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.600
How do I come to that? Well, because Jesus when

338
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.300
he's teaching about the kingdom he's talking about something that is

339
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.800
both already and not yet.

340
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.700
And what that means is that his kingdom has come in Jesus

341
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.700
coming to Earth and Jesus reigning in human

342
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.400
hearts.

343
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.900
But we all know that it's not fully there yet, right.

344
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.300
He hasn't full. He doesn't have full rain over

345
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.500
everything yet. So his kingdom is also not yet here.

346
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.500
When's that going to happen?

347
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.400
When he comes back at the end of days whenever Jesus returns as

348
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.100
the king it will all be under his authority. And

349
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:03.800
so that means

350
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.800
it's future. It's talking about heaven.

351
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.600
Also in verse 14 he talked about the resurrection of

352
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.600
the just that's again the last day the wedding supper

353
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.200
of the Lamb then he told the parable in response to the

354
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.500
guy's statement in verse 15. Who said this is the kingdom of God, right? He's

355
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.600
like no. No, actually there's something more to come.

356
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.500
So Jesus was talking in this Parable like

357
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.000
his father was the one throwing the party an

358
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.700
eternal feast.

359
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.300
and now in Jesus

360
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.300
coming it had been ready prepared. It's

361
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.800
here.

362
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.700
Come on in.

363
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.600
That's what the parable is teaching that it's prepared.

364
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.800
He's done it all.

365
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.400
But what happened when the man invited people?

366
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.000
His invitations were spurned, right? They were

367
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.900
turned away. They were refused as invitations were spurned.

368
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.300
Those people who were invited right they gave excuse after excuse about why

369
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:04.800
they could never come.

370
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.300
Can't come right now. I got I got to check a new field. I

371
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.200
got these 10 oxen that I just bought I got to make sure they're ready. I got

372
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.700
I got a new watch got married man. Come out like give me some time.

373
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.100
What's interesting here?

374
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.800
None of those excuses are sinful, right?

375
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.000
It's all good things. We need to work hard.

376
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.600
We need to take care of our families.

377
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.700
Those are good things.

378
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.200
Here's the problem in the context of the parable those

379
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.400
good things kept.

380
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.800
each person from responding to the invitation

381
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.900
where they got those things out of order.

382
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.700
They said they saw these things as more valuable than

383
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:50.300
the banquet.

384
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:51.600
and the invitation

385
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.300
same thing for us right good things get out

386
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.100
of order in our lives and they become God things to us. And

387
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.500
that begins to destroy us.

388
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.400
And so they're refusal led the man throwing the party not

389
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.400
to to give up his party. He didn't ask there people

390
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.300
refused. I'm just gonna stop I don't want to do the

391
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.200
party. No, he actually said I want this party to keep

392
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.200
going. So go gather the outcasts of

393
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:19.400
the city.

394
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.900
Go gather the outcasts servant.

395
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.300
Go gather them in now. I'm not talking he saw them as

396
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.500
outcasts. I'm saying the ones that Society viewed as

397
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.900
second class citizens. He said go get them.

398
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.600
Poor the crippled the lamb the blind like those who everybody

399
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.200
else cast aside. I want them

400
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.400
in.

401
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.300
notice the link in language

402
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.100
in the parable that he says go go invite all

403
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.200
of those people. It's the same language. Jesus used up in

404
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.300
verse 13 when he's talking to the Pharisees, right? He said when you

405
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.100
throw a party go invite the poor the crippled to lame

406
00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.700
the blind. He said the same words in both sections.

407
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.500
because he's saying this temporary

408
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.600
party is a visual illustration of

409
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.900
what the Eternal party is going to be like

410
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.000
And I want you guys to live out what I am

411
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:13.800
doing for you.

412
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.600
Live it out every day.

413
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.500
Because remember that the Jews that he was talking to at that

414
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:20.500
moment.

415
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.300
They all most likely viewed the Gentiles

416
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.400
the non-jews as people

417
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.600
who are outcasts as those who are

418
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.600
in this category.

419
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.000
They would have seen no. No, there's no way they can get in.

420
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.100
No, we we are the ones in.

421
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.500
They can't make it the Nations know.

422
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.100
But what Jesus does here in the parable is he says actually?

423
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.100
My heart is for all nations to

424
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.500
fill my salvation house.

425
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.800
Like I want them all together. I got a big house. It's big big

426
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.500
house with lots and lots of rooms and and

427
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.600
the big table with lots and lots of food.

428
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.100
And am I the only one who remembers that right? I don't know

429
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.900
anybody cut that one. Okay, Audio Adrenaline. Yeah. There you go.

430
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.900
Okay, play football. There you go. Good one.

431
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:11.400
Yeah.

432
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.400
He's got a big house. He's set it up. He's prepared it. In fact,

433
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:15.900
here's what happened.

434
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.100
Those Jews refused to

435
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.500
hear and receive the invitation of

436
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.600
Jesus and that opened the door for the

437
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.300
Gentiles to hear and receive the Gospel.

438
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.600
That's all over scripture.

439
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.700
Repeated after one after another that that's

440
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.200
what happened whenever they said. No, we don't want you

441
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.000
Jesus.

442
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:38.800
He said, okay.

443
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.400
I'm going to the Gentiles.

444
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.200
The church did in Acts all over the place.

445
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.100
It's here in this Parable, right?

446
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.400
They refuse they refused they had the invitation twice refused

447
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.000
and he said, okay.

448
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.900
Go after the outcasts.

449
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.100
The ones that they would consider to be outcasts.

450
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.500
There's one more principle here at the end of this Parable. It's

451
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.100
that the parties refusers those who denied the

452
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.700
invitation were actually denied entry into the

453
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.100
banquet the parties refusers those who refuse the

454
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.500
invitation were denied.

455
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.100
entry

456
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.500
they didn't make it in verse 24 says

457
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.400
now again, this is not making a theological statement.

458
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.600
That somehow God's call is resistible.

459
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.100
Or that in some times. It's certain people.

460
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.300
It's ineffectual.

461
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.800
That's not saying that no. Remember Jesus was talking to

462
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.300
those who believed themselves to be

463
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.000
representatives of the kingdom of God on Earth.

464
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.200
To those who assumed they would

465
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.300
be in the Kingdom based on their family lineage.

466
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.400
We're sons of Abraham, of course despite their

467
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.400
arrogance in that despite their contempt toward

468
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.100
others in that and despite the fact that they refused Jesus

469
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.200
really was the Messiah in fact killed him

470
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:12.500
later.

471
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:14.500
Yeah, we're good.

472
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.300
Because Abraham is our father.

473
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.200
That's what Jesus told this Parable because he

474
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.200
wanted them to see that. It's not about Birthright. It's about

475
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:25.700
belief.

476
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.400
As a matter where you were born it matters, do

477
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:30.900
you believe?

478
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.300
And that means even those unlikely Gentiles can

479
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.800
get in if they repent and belief.

480
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.300
So again, that's the essence of this Parable it

481
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.900
goes back to how people responded to the man's invitation

482
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.400
to the party.

483
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.500
Did they receive it with joy with urgency?

484
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.300
Or do they refuse it?

485
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.100
That means when you take it eternally Jesus saying

486
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.400
this that means it's all about then what people

487
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.500
do with Jesus?

488
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.900
That's the whole.

489
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.300
Cut in Middle. Like that's it. It's all about

490
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.000
what you do with Jesus.

491
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.300
Now the theological work behind the scenes that's up to God how

492
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.500
he works all of that out, but it's still then comes down to what someone

493
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.100
does how they respond to Jesus.

494
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.800
And that's the question. He's asking them and to us really when you look at

495
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.200
Jesus's life death and Resurrection in your

496
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.500
place.

497
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.300
Are you in or are you out?

498
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.400
That's the dividing line.

499
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.700
And really that again is the purpose of parables in

500
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.300
general, right?

501
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.500
And this one specifically of course, but Jesus.

502
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.100
Used Parables to divide to separate those looking for the

503
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.700
kingdom looking for the Savior from those who weren't.

504
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.700
That's happening here.

505
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.900
Again, these these self-righteous Jewish leaders

506
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.600
were we're expecting to be at God's

507
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.000
table. But Jesus says actually

508
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.200
You might not make it in.

509
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.500
And they're sitting there thinking about these Gentiles who

510
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.800
no way they make it in. They're the unexpected ones

511
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.300
and Jesus saying actually

512
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:24.700
they're gonna make it in.

513
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.700
If they receive and believe he's getting

514
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.900
to their hearts. He's addressing their selfishness.

515
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.000
He's doing that for us every week too, doesn't he?

516
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.100
Like these parables are not just for those original. Here's these

517
00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:46.200
are for us today. He's addressing things in us that we can drift

518
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.300
into the same kind of mentality that

519
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.100
they did. We need to be struck as well

520
00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.600
by these things.

521
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.100
So three purposes here for this parable.

522
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.400
That we need to understand just as much today that they need to understand that

523
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.500
we do as well. First the principle here the

524
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.000
purpose is that those missing the pedigree are

525
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.900
actually welcome.

526
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.100
Those missing the pedigree are welcome and what that

527
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.900
word pedigree means is not dog food. It means someone's background.

528
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.500
someone's history

529
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.300
Right. It's it's what they bring to

530
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.500
the table. What is their pathway before that

531
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.300
point? And again the Pharisees assumed we're

532
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.100
getting in like verse 15 implied, right? The guy

533
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.300
was like this is what it's gonna be. Like when we're there right? They assume

534
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.000
they were gonna get in Jesus says, no just because you're in the

535
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.500
family line of Abraham doesn't mean anything.

536
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.100
if you don't believe

537
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.600
Jesus says I'm the new Vine.

538
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.300
I am the way to Salvation. It's not through that anymore. It's

539
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.300
through me.

540
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.600
Based on faith in him because remember when he talked about these outcasts he

541
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.200
was talking about Gentiles those who are unclean to

542
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.300
the Jews those who could never worship and he

543
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.300
said you guys look at them as if there's no chance they

544
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:09.600
could get in.

545
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.800
That's not the way you should think.

546
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.200
It's not about your pedigree your background history. It's about what you do with

547
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.900
Jesus. So hear me in this.

548
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.600
Don't think that that same kind of mentality can't happen today

549
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.600
too Church.

550
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.500
The way that we think about people it's not

551
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.400
genealogy anymore. We're not talking about that. But the way this shows

552
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.300
up is that some of us grew up in church, like we know all

553
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.800
the answers. We have kept a pretty clean external

554
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.000
lifestyle like like we feel kind of

555
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:40.900
worthy for this.

556
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.200
I I deserve to be at the head too. I

557
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.000
deserve to be the king look at this.

558
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.000
But that leads again to arrogance.

559
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.300
Contempt toward those whose Lifestyles don't

560
00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:57.700
match up.

561
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.800
Who didn't grow up in the same environment who don't feel

562
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.400
like they deserve to get in and we kind of treat them

563
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.600
like they don't deserve to get in.

564
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.700
Somehow people are too dirty too far gone some

565
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.400
of you feel that right now that you were too dirty for God

566
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.500
and we see people as too dirty too far

567
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.700
gone. There's no way they're gonna get in.

568
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.800
Don't think this can't happen today Church.

569
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.500
But this Parable screams to us that

570
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.900
Jesus came for those people, too.

571
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.100
He came to the people didn't grow up in church, right? He came for the

572
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.300
people who the last couple days spent outside of the state capital

573
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.400
saying bans off our bodies. He came for the people engaging in

574
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.600
same-sex relationships right now. He came for the alcoholic. He

575
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.400
came for the drug addict. He came for the Immigrant. He came

576
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:48.900
for the poor.

577
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.700
And I could go on and on but many of those people the church

578
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.700
historically has written them off.

579
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.900
Has not loved them has not respected their dignity as

580
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.900
a person.

581
00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.400
Is what is so compelling about jesus' love because Time

582
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.200
After Time and God's word. He takes those who are

583
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.900
far from God and he makes them his

584
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.900
remember the key verse in the entire Book of Luke Luke. 19:10 says

585
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.600
the son of man came to seek and save

586
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.000
the Lost.

587
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.700
That's what the whole book revolves around.

588
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.100
That means the tax collectors the sinners.

589
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.200
Those outside the fellowship those hated considered

590
00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.100
by Jews as outcasts.

591
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.200
That's who he's talking about. He came for the Lost.

592
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.700
In fact the Apostle Paul wrote this same thing later. Remember the

593
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.300
Apostle Paul was a man who had Christians murdered.

594
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.700
Who spoke evil against Jesus he persecuted the

595
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.700
church. Here's what he says later after God saved

596
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.400
his life. The saying is trustworthy and deserving

597
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.000
a full acceptance Christ. Jesus came into the

598
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.300
world to save Sinners of whom I'm the foremost.

599
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:10.700
so

600
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:12.500
sinner

601
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.800
You are welcome here.

602
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.300
You are welcome in the kingdom of God.

603
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.000
It doesn't matter what you've done.

604
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.500
It doesn't matter how you grew up.

605
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.100
If God is opening your heart to see his

606
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.700
his payment for your sin to

607
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.500
see the invitation of Jesus. If if he's

608
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.400
opening your eyes to see that you have just as

609
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.500
much a right to come as anybody else does.

610
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.600
If you turn from your sin and you turn to Jesus you have

611
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.600
just as much a right to be in the kingdom of God as anybody

612
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.200
else who grew up in a perfect family.

613
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.600
Because Romans 9:16 says it depends not on human

614
00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.300
will or effort but on God who has Mercy.

615
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.600
It's not how much you've done or how much you've not done. It's on him. It's

616
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.200
about your response to his grace in your

617
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:08.500
life.

618
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:13.800
But here's what happens.

619
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.500
He did for the Jews. It does for many people today.

620
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.700
What happens is what we saw with the parable of the soils a

621
00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.200
few weeks ago right where where some people hear that

622
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.600
message and they have hard-hearted unbelieving soil in

623
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.500
their heart. They where they there's there's rocks all

624
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.100
in it, and it it might look like it grows for a second but it's really

625
00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:36.500
shallow and it Heats of the heat of the world kind of takes over

626
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.400
or it grows up among thorns and all the things

627
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.400
the world choke out what it was doing. It's

628
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.100
distracted. It's worldly. That's the kind of soil. We just

629
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:45.600
saw here, right?

630
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.300
Jesus showed clearly that those who were

631
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.100
chasing the obstacles distracted.

632
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:56.800
or blocked

633
00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.300
from the kingdom

634
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.300
they didn't get in.

635
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.600
They made excuses.

636
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.500
So now we

637
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:11.900
were busy.

638
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.500
This is more important right now.

639
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.400
They made excuses and the warning here is that

640
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.400
it's so simple for us. It's easy for

641
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.500
us to let competing affections in this world.

642
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.400
Steal away our devotion to the Lord and

643
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.900
it ends up destroying us.

644
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.200
even good things

645
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:37.500
taking God level things in our

646
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.100
lives destroys leads us to

647
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.800
be blocked from the Eternal banquet as supremely

648
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.800
valuable in our lives because listen, it's not only gross sin

649
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.300
in your life that keeps you from the kingdom.

650
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.500
It's also what we call more respectable sins like

651
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.100
greed.

652
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.100
materialism

653
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.100
Selfishness arrogant self-righteousness all these things also

654
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.700
keep you from the kingdom.

655
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.400
So we need to examine our hearts if anything else is enthroned in that

656
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.200
place. It must be.

657
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:11.800
removed

658
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.900
Slotted accordingly behind him.

659
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.200
And listen, you cannot delay you can't wait on this

660
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.300
because the final purposes Parable is the lesson that only those who

661
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.100
heed the urgency are included.

662
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.000
Did you see that?

663
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:32.900
They got the invite.

664
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.100
They refused it.

665
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.200
excluded

666
00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.500
only those who he did the urgency with Joy

667
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.500
are included the first people were distracted. They cared

668
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.500
more about temporary things and the glory of the man throwing the feast but

669
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.500
the people who received the invitation responded to

670
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.400
it. They were the ones who got to enjoy the banquet.

671
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.000
And so the hard question today.

672
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.800
Knowing this is all pointing us to the Eternal Feast the

673
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.000
time Jesus returns knowing this is

674
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.300
about salvation first and foremost.

675
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.200
the question is

676
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.600
will you be there?

677
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.900
Will you be at that Eternal Feast coming someday?

678
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.400
Have you opened have you opened your eyes has

679
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.100
he opened your ears to hear his invitation to the

680
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:26.400
party?

681
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.400
And have you responded in Repentance and Faith

682
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.400
by saying you're my Lord nothing else? No, excuse you are

683
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:33.700
it?

684
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.400
Don't just assume.

685
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.400
That because you grew up in church.

686
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.100
Because you were baptized at eight.

687
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.400
Because you belong to the right group or because it looks

688
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.500
right in your life or you're always doing charitable things

689
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.000
in life. Don't just assume that you're in.

690
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.900
You must respond to his gracious invitation.

691
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.900
Because there's gonna come a day when it's too late.

692
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.600
Like here the end to those who refused.

693
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.200
Jesus will say

694
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.400
None of them shall taste my banquet.

695
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.700
And I know this is hard to hear.

696
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.300
But when Jesus proclaimed the kingdom of God, he was not meant to

697
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.700
reassure everybody who's hearing him.

698
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.700
He was meaning these things to shake us up.

699
00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.300
to show us the kingdom is so different than the way of the world so

700
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.500
different the way we think

701
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.600
but he does that because listen there is nothing like the

702
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.400
kingdom of God.

703
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.600
There's nothing like this eternal feast.

704
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.100
And that is it's implied here. It's inherent in the

705
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.200
parable itself. The fact that this banquet the man is

706
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.600
throwing that he's prepared. He's inviting people to the banquet

707
00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.600
itself is something to be cherished.

708
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.000
It's something that's better than anything else the world

709
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.200
can offer like he's sitting there confused. Like why would you not want to come to

710
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:07.800
the banquet?

711
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.500
What's so important about all that other stuff? You don't want to come here, really?

712
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.500
It's the point is that there's there's something different here.

713
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.300
And in fact what we're doing here in this room in this

714
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.400
moment is a foretaste of the Eternal wedding Feast

715
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.300
to come someday.

716
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.200
Right. That's why the church Gathering must be so important to us.

717
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.700
It's not just about checking a box and coming to church. It's because this

718
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.200
is a taste of what we're gonna get to do forever. Think

719
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.800
about what we're doing here.

720
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.600
We're singing praises to the lamb.

721
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.500
To Jesus just like they're doing in heaven right now and what

722
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.900
we're gonna do around that table celebrating together the

723
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.400
lamb who was slain in our place.

724
00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.200
We're doing that every time we gather we're linking

725
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.600
arms with brothers and sisters from many nations in

726
00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.400
Fellowship around the good news of Jesus in

727
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.800
our place that we're so diverse yet. We're one around

728
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.200
the gospel.

729
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.600
It's happening in heaven. It will happen forever.

730
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.100
We're serving One Another We're on our knees like Jesus did

731
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.500
on that Passover meal night where he was serving

732
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.300
his his disciples. He'll do it again

733
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.200
on that Eternal day for us. We're serving each other that kind of

734
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:20.800
way here.

735
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.700
As a foretaste of what's coming.

736
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.200
But then even think further you can see we got the table set up to the Lord's

737
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.800
Supper today. Think about how that

738
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.300
as we eat and Shrink to remind us of the broken body

739
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.100
and shed blood of Jesus in our place how that covering

740
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.300
our sin forgiving us of everything.

741
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:45.200
We have done and ever will do how that draws our

742
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.800
hearts to worship.

743
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.900
That it reminds us of the Gospel that it's a glimpse of

744
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.400
the joy that we will experience when

745
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.800
we on that day. See our groom face to

746
00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:57.900
face.

747
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.700
And will Feast together with him forever?

748
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.100
This is a reminder.

749
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.200
A foretaste of Glory Divine something that we

750
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.000
can't even fathom right now. It's a taste of

751
00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.200
it that he

752
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.300
the master

753
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.400
has made it already.

754
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.700
He's prepared the party. He's prepared

755
00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.100
the feast what that means is he's done everything necessary for

756
00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.000
your salvation.

757
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.600
He's done it all he's brought the invitation to

758
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.300
us and by his grace. He'll fill that wedding

759
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.700
hall with guests.

760
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.100
That he will invite in people who don't feel like

761
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.300
they deserve to be there who don't say I I am

762
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.300
worthy to be none of that.

763
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.600
By his grace were chosen to be there.

764
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.300
He came after us he went after us and said you

765
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.600
come let's go you're in my banquet.

766
00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.600
And we by his grace will be there

767
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.200
if we repent and believe that is all why

768
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.600
we humbly agree with

769
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.300
what Revelation 19 shows us about that day

770
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.500
where he there's this Roar of many Waters the

771
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.700
sound of Mighty peels a thunder and everyone there is crying

772
00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.300
out Hallelujah for the Lord Our God

773
00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.700
the all Mighty rains that we rejoice and

774
00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.300
exalt give him glory for the marriage of the Lamb

775
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.300
has come the bride has made herself ready. It was

776
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.800
granted her to clothe himself with fine women and bright and pure notice

777
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.500
granted too not we cleaned ourselves up. He

778
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.300
cleaned us and brought us to himself.

779
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.400
But here's the best part look at verse 9. The angel said

780
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.400
to me right this blessed are those who are

781
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.300
invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb?

782
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.200
If you have been invited.

783
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.200
And you get to be there.

784
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.500
You don't deserve it.

785
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.300
And deserve it.

786
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:03.800
But what?

787
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.900
See, it's a worship to.

788
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.200
To be included to have the feast forever to have

789
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.500
all of the blessings of God.

790
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.100
Do you see that church?

791
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.800
How blessed it is.

792
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.500
to be included by faith

793
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.900
May that change the way we respond.

794
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.000
in everything
