00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:02.645
Yeah.

2
00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:07.525
Hey, I was stuck inside that graver. Long time.

3
00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:10.845
Didn't think I'm making through those long nights,

4
00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.045
but you never let you always on time.

5
00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:18.365
Remember when you got me all day, you got me out that,

6
00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:22.645
and now I see your blessing, your blessings every day.

7
00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:27.205
Thankful kingdoms.

8
00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:35.965
I'll never get used to this. I'll never get used to this.

9
00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:39.365
This is how I wanna live.

10
00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:46.405
Be singing about the grave that I'm alive

11
00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:47.545
Now.

12
00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:50.005
Told the devil, you outta Time now

13
00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:55.645
I die.

14
00:00:57.105 --> 00:00:57.325
Die.

15
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:15.205
I never gave to this. I never get used to this.

16
00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:22.005
This is how I wanna live. Singing live

17
00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:34.765
From the Morning to the evening.

18
00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:39.245
I can sing your praise all day from the

19
00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:40.885
to the

20
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:53.725
I can soon. Thank

21
00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:54.725
You, Jesus.

22
00:01:56.435 --> 00:02:01.165
I'll never get used to this. I'll never get used to this.

23
00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:04.365
This is how I wanna live

24
00:02:10.035 --> 00:02:10.925
used to this.
