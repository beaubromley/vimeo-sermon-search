1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.400
Who is the god

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.300
like Yahweh the god

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.400
of wrath the god of Mercy The God

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.700
Who reaches down to unworthy people.

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.800
Well, good morning again church. I hope you had a great six days

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.200
of worshiping out there. Then we

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.100
get the privilege and blessing of worshiping together and here

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.800
on Sundays. It is definitely a privilege and a joy to

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
do that. And so take your copy of God's word with me

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.900
and turn back to the Book of Micah as we took a break last week

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.800
for Labor Day in Psalm 50. We're back

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.900
into Micah walking verse by verse through that chapter

13
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.700
three today.

14
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.100
As we get into it though, you might have heard about the

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.300
famous author named Mark Twain.

16
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.500
Yes, he was prolific writer, but Twain was

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.100
actually hostile to the Bible and to the

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.900
Christian faith.

19
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.000
Why was that?

20
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.200
Well, it was because of Mostly because of

21
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.500
the influence of Christian leaders in his early life.

22
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.600
See if he grew up. He knew ministers and

23
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.200
elders and deacons.

24
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.400
Who owns slaves and abused them and use the

25
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.400
Bible to justify slavery?

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.600
He also heard.

27
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.500
men using foul language

28
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.200
saw them practicing dishonesty all

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.100
throughout the week.

30
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.400
After speaking piously in church

31
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.100
on Sunday.

32
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.800
Now he had great influences his wife. His mother were believers.

33
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.900
But he was so disturbed by the bad teaching

34
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.300
and the poor example of church leaders that

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.700
he was bitter toward the faith.

36
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.400
Now most of us probably have people in

37
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.600
our lives that we could point to a very similar story. It's happened

38
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.900
throughout church history.

39
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.800
It's actually something we're going to see in Micah chapter 3 today.

40
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.300
Here's the truth. I hope you see.

41
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.000
If you get nothing else out of today, you can remember these simple

42
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.700
words here.

43
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.500
selfish leadership equals terrible outcomes

44
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.000
selfish leadership

45
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400
equals terrible outcomes

46
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.200
these leaders, of course have a terrible outcome on the

47
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.400
back end of that. But really what we're going to press into today

48
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.800
is

49
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.800
those they're leading.

50
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.300
Have terrible outcomes as well.

51
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.500
Micah is continuing to speak God's words to

52
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.400
his people who'd been Turning Away throughout the whole

53
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.200
first couple chapters. They've been running away from God.

54
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.500
And here in chapter 3 God sets his

55
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.200
sights squarely.

56
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.200
on the leadership of the nation

57
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.000
look now chapter 3 verses 1

58
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.300
through 12 to see God's judgment on leaders.

59
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.800
And I said, this is Micah. He's saying here you

60
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.900
heads of Jacob and rulers of the House of Israel. Is it

61
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.200
not for you to know Justice?

62
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.200
You who hate the good and love the evil who tear the

63
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.400
skin from off my people and their flesh from off their bones who eat

64
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.900
the Flesh of My People Play their skin from off them break their

65
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.500
bones and pieces and chop them up like meat in a

66
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.000
pot like flesh in a cauldron.

67
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.300
Then they will cry to the Lord, but he

68
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.100
will not answer them.

69
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.500
He will hide his face from them at that time because they've made

70
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.900
their deeds evil.

71
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.500
Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who lead my people

72
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.300
astray who cry peace when they have

73
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.200
something to eat, but declare war against him who puts

74
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.200
nothing into their mouths.

75
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.200
Therefore it shall be Knight to you without vision.

76
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.200
And darkness to you without divination the sun shall go

77
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.100
down on the prophets the day shall be black over them. The fear

78
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.400
should be disgraced the diviners put to shame. They shall

79
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.400
all cover their lips. There's no answer from God.

80
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.800
but as for me Micah says

81
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400
I am filled with power with the spirit of the Lord

82
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.700
with Justice and might.

83
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.200
To declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel

84
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.900
his sin.

85
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.000
Hear this you have heads of the House of Jacob and rulers of the

86
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.600
House of Israel who detest Justice and make

87
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.100
crooked all that is straight.

88
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.100
Who builds on with blood in Jerusalem with iniquity?

89
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.800
Its heads give judgment for a bribe. It's priests teach

90
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.500
for a price. It's prophets practice divination for

91
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.700
money.

92
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.300
Yet they lean on the Lord and say it's

93
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.500
not the Lord in the midst of us. No disaster shall

94
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.100
come upon us.

95
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.700
therefore

96
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.500
because of you

97
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.400
Zion shall be plowed as a field.

98
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.800
Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins

99
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.600
and the mountain of the house a wooded Heights

100
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.300
now as we dig through this passage of first what

101
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.500
it meant 2700 years ago to those

102
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.100
original hears. We need to understand the reasons for

103
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.700
God's judgment.

104
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.500
Why was he saying this? Why was God

105
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.700
going to judge his people?

106
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.600
It was really three categories here in this chapter and

107
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.600
they all have to do with the leaders of God's people because those

108
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.900
leaders were supposed to be ensuring that

109
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.700
Justice governed all human relationships.

110
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.200
that what God Said is how this is supposed to work and they

111
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.500
were they were supposed to be in charge of that, but they clearly weren't

112
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.000
and first the category we see is unjust

113
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.600
judges.

114
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.200
One of the reasons God's judging them first. It's unjust judges.

115
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.400
That's these heads and rulers. He talks about in verse 1 and verse

116
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.500
9 this this was a national court system that

117
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.500
was made up of families and clans. It

118
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.600
goes all the way back to Exodus 18 with Jethro and

119
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.500
Moses when Moses trying to judge everybody and Jethro is

120
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.400
like no break him up into smaller groups give heads and

121
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.100
judges over each one of those it was almost like this

122
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.100
National court system kind of a People's Court

123
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.400
dentist, right like you think of how that works

124
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.700
in Israel.

125
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.000
So if anyone think about that if anyone should have been fair and

126
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.600
equitable.

127
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.300
It should have been these judges who

128
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.400
were judging family members disputes.

129
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.200
It should have been easy for them to make it equal to

130
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.400
no justice as verse 1 says.

131
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.300
That we're Justice Means to fairly give people what they

132
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.400
are do according to God's.

133
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.600
Plan what he says is right. That's Justice. It's

134
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.300
just aligning with What God Says is the

135
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.600
right way to do things. That's true justice as

136
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.700
Leviticus 19:15 says in the csb translation

137
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.500
says do not act unjustly when deciding a

138
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.900
case do not be partial to the poor nor give

139
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.300
preference to the rich says judge your

140
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.100
neighbor fairly.

141
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.300
Meaning just be fair be right according to what God

142
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.800
says is right and wrong.

143
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.300
That's what they were supposed to be doing. The problem was verse 2 says they

144
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.600
flipped it. They hated the good and loved

145
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.000
the evil.

146
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.600
Verse 9. They detest Justice they make crooked

147
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.500
the things that were straight God is straight. They make

148
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.400
they make crooked all of that stuff, right?

149
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.500
Everything God's plan says is right. They make crooked everything

150
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.800
else. It was the exact opposite of God's basic foundational

151
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.400
principles in his Covenant

152
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.600
for the way Hebrew society should have worked.

153
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.800
They just completely distorted everything.

154
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.600
And Micah vividly Illustrated that.

155
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.100
With this series of brutal metaphors that he is talking

156
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.500
about Flesh and Bones and

157
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.300
cauldrons and tearing up it revealed their

158
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.700
hard hearts that they were oppressing people

159
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.700
almost to the point where they were eating them alive.

160
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.500
That's the image he gives here is how how

161
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.000
terrible they were treating people.

162
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.400
Verse 11 even says they took bribes to give

163
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.600
judgments one way or the other they gave the wealthy

164
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.400
people good judgments because they could line their pockets while

165
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.500
the poor people just suffered further.

166
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.700
That's not the way judgments should work right? It's not Justice.

167
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.600
Which is why God says in verse 4 what he says about these unjust

168
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.300
judges. He says then they will cry to the Lord, but he

169
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.000
will not answer them.

170
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.300
He'll hide his face from them at that time because they made their

171
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.500
deeds evil.

172
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.300
So like the poor had been suffering and were crying out

173
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.500
for help from the leaders and they were not getting any response. Now, the

174
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.300
leaders will be suffering and God says I'm not even listening

175
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:27.600
to you.

176
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.300
He says he's turning his face hiding his face, which

177
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.600
is an illustration of what once was Covenant blessing

178
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.000
where God's face was fixed on his people now

179
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.600
he turns away.

180
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.100
It's how far they have fallen.

181
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.500
But remember selfish leadership equals terrible outcomes, right?

182
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.500
There's a second category here. Unjust judges

183
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.200
second category for God's judgment was unspiritual Prophets.

184
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.200
We see unspiritual prophets in this passage.

185
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.300
Look again at verse 5.

186
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.600
Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who lead my people astray who

187
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.500
cry peace when they have something to eat, but declare war against

188
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.800
him who puts nothing into their mouths.

189
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.000
Very similar, right? They're getting paid to prophesy one

190
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.700
certain thing. They sounded authentic because

191
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.600
their profits and they had the right words to say, but

192
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.400
these were considered false because they LED God's people astray with

193
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.300
bogus vision.

194
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.700
It wasn't what God was saying because they were supposed to stand as

195
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.800
kind of conscience of Israel.

196
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.500
To look around and see above what they're

197
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.100
seeing in the the way the world Works to guys. This is wrong. This is

198
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.300
not right. This is what God wants they were supposed to stand above it

199
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.000
all but here they're in the middle of it all.

200
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.100
And they're pulled by who can give them the most money versus who

201
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.600
can't.

202
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.500
So God says actually you who once could

203
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.400
hear from God as a prophetic gift.

204
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.500
no longer will hear

205
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.400
Will no longer will receive a message from

206
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.500
the Lord you will actually Fade Into shame and

207
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.900
obscurity like the darkness.

208
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.600
You will not hear anymore because you've

209
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.300
abused the gift that I gave you.

210
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.300
The sign of God's judgment that he would go silent to

211
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.600
his people that's judgment on his people.

212
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.200
but again selfish leadership

213
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.300
equals terrible outcomes

214
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.100
Of referenced verse 11 a couple times, but look again at it. I

215
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.500
want to read all of it to show this third category for Why God is judging

216
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.400
his people.

217
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.400
Verse 11 says it's heads give judgment for a bribe. It's

218
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.200
priests teach for a price. It's prophets practice divination for

219
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.300
money. We've already seen that yet. They

220
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.800
lean on the Lord and say

221
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.600
is not the Lord in the midst of us.

222
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.600
No disaster she'll come upon us.

223
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.500
Now we saw this in Chapter 2 a very similar thought

224
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:11.800
right?

225
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.700
where they were

226
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.500
at that time the wealthy influencers it

227
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.300
was talking about how they would just go around they would steal land from people

228
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.500
and they were consuming people. It's a very similar idea

229
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.500
that that as they were going around taking things from

230
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.800
people. They said we're safe because Jerusalem

231
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.500
is our hometown and because the temple is sitting

232
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.700
right over there. We're safe. Nothing's gonna happen to us. We're God's

233
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:36.800
people

234
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:40.800
Same thought here.

235
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.000
That's why I chose the word unwise leaders

236
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.800
to describe them.

237
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.900
unwise

238
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.700
You might say the other way fools.

239
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.900
Foolish leaders why that word? Well,

240
00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.000
it's because of what Proverbs 1:7 says

241
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.700
very clearly.

242
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.700
That the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.

243
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.600
fools despise wisdom and

244
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.200
instruction

245
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.200
Remember when we say fear God?

246
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.300
There is a little bit of Terror in that

247
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.500
idea because God is God and we're not

248
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.100
right. We should be afraid in some small

249
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.800
measure of that. But primarily when the Bible says fear God.

250
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.300
It's this idea of all inspiring reverence.

251
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.400
That he is worthy of me submitting to him because

252
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.000
he's so great. He's so glorious that is fearing him.

253
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.200
It's submission respect to him.

254
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.600
And so think about these mica3 leaders, right?

255
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.400
The judges the priests the prophets the ones who are being paid off

256
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.300
to say what they're about to say giving good judgments to

257
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.700
those who give more money bad judgment less, right Prof sighing

258
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.400
all these things to one of the other based on what they're

259
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.400
getting from them.

260
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.100
They thought they were fine even as they did all that.

261
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.500
Again, it says we lean on the Lord.

262
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.400
The Lord is in the midst of us.

263
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.400
Which they assumed was true because they had the temple next

264
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.600
to him and they had the Ark of the Covenant in there. They just assumed that

265
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.200
meant God was on their side.

266
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.400
Clearly weren't revering God or acknowledging God in

267
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.700
any way in their lives.

268
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.600
They were not fearing him instead as

269
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.300
fools. They're taking bribes. They're committing

270
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.300
injustices. They're destroying people's lives. They're doing all

271
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.000
of those things and yet still saying. Yeah God's with

272
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.200
us.

273
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.900
They'd forgotten.

274
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.500
That God made his presence contingent not

275
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.600
on a location but on ethical

276
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.100
Behavior.

277
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.000
And here's what I'm talking about.

278
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.600
All the way back at Sinai Mountain where God gave

279
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.500
Moses the Ten Commandments and then called them

280
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.200
to leave to go into the promised land. This is

281
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.500
what God Said Exodus 33 verse 3. He says

282
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.400
go up to a land flowing with milk and honey like you get to

283
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.300
go to the promised land.

284
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.000
But I will not go up among you.

285
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.500
Lest I consume you on the way for you

286
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.900
are a stiff necked people.

287
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.100
Stiff necked that word means rebellious.

288
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.400
Sinful, it means they had been running away

289
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.300
from his Covenant commands and he says

290
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.900
I just need you to go to your room for a while as I

291
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.300
can. Remember that your your mom is really angry right

292
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.400
now and just needs to get away from you for a second, right? That's the

293
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.000
same kind of idea. God says I don't want to be with you.

294
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.000
Because I don't want to hurt you. I love you that much first of all.

295
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.700
But at the same time you see his presence was contingent.

296
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.400
On what they were doing?

297
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.300
Not that they had the temple or the Tabernacle or the Arctica,

298
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.400
whatever it was. They were like no, this is what I'm calling

299
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:14.900
you to.

300
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.500
That's why the Judgment of God was coming on these people and

301
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.000
Micah 3.

302
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.200
They were doing all these things and saying yeah. Well

303
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.300
God's with us. That's why verse 12 shows us what God's gonna do.

304
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.100
He says therefore because of all of that

305
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.400
right because of what they've been doing and saying God's with us and

306
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.700
not fearing him at all because of you Zion should

307
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.800
be plowed as a field.

308
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.300
Jerusalem should become a heap of ruins.

309
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.400
And the mountain of the house a wooded height.

310
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.000
in other words this mountain

311
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.700
that was once a stronghold.

312
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.100
a safe City

313
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.300
Where they would run to and they'd be safe and that was where God

314
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.600
protected them. And it was God's Hometown in essence

315
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.600
all of that. He's saying I'm willing to lay it to waste.

316
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:08.700
Because of what you're doing.

317
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.300
Because how you're leading these people.

318
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.000
selfish greedy foolish

319
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.500
selfish leadership equals terrible outcomes, right?

320
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.800
Now think about those people who are hearing this.

321
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.100
in the moment

322
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.700
hard to hear

323
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.500
those leaders would have been convicted hopefully.

324
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.400
And thankfully here's what we have. We have a record of King

325
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.400
Hezekiah and his people responding to

326
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.800
this very message in Repentance.

327
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.500
You can go read it. It's in Isaiah. 36:37 Jeremiah

328
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.500
26. You can go read the story of how God

329
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.300
used this message from Mike and probably

330
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.600
Isaiah too to preach to them and they responded and

331
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.900
God delayed judgment on Judah for about a hundred years.

332
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.100
So this actually did get through to a few people.

333
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.300
But we need to then think. Okay. How does this translate 2,700

334
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.400
years forward to us today.

335
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.200
How do we bring this into an apply these

336
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.700
principles to our lives?

337
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.300
Okay. Well we have to think first. What's the context we have

338
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.500
to remember some really critical pieces of this.

339
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.400
Because it's not a one-to-one thing here and we'll see how

340
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.800
we can apply it properly today.

341
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.000
Here's the biggest part of this.

342
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.800
Remember that Micah was talking to a theocracy.

343
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.100
It's a big word that simply means a nation that is

344
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.200
under God's complete rule.

345
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.700
supposed to be

346
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.500
and so they were set apart as God's distinct people

347
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.000
meaning he was to Reign. He was to rule they would have his laws

348
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.700
as their laws. All of that was a theocracy. That

349
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.500
was what it was supposed to be.

350
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.600
But I want you to hear me.

351
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.700
That's not America.

352
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.900
That's not any other Nation today.

353
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.000
So we can't go one to one and say this is

354
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.200
how it has to be here. If anything what we're talking about is

355
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:20.900
the kingdom of God.

356
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.800
That that's the parallel here. That's including anybody

357
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.300
who has faith and anyone

358
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.600
who will have faith in Jesus Christ forever. Whoever it

359
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.800
is, right? That's that's the kingdom of God. That's a super

360
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.500
Nation above any other tangible Nation

361
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.900
here. And so we see that that's how we can directly apply

362
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.000
spiritual principles from Micah 3.

363
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.400
Right, those those things matter right the priests and Prophets so

364
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.900
still carry over obviously into our church

365
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.400
life our religious life.

366
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.000
that just like Micah was

367
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.500
calling out those who are fraudulently fulfilling their

368
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.100
functions as priests and Prophets. He was he was all

369
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.300
for calling him out and we can too as we'll see in

370
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.200
a moment. But this other side is where the question comes.

371
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.100
This Justice side the physical day-to-day

372
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.500
how we apply that here

373
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.300
into our lives. Can we?

374
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.700
In a secular society like we live in now, how

375
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.100
do we apply these things? Well, I

376
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.800
think I think we can if we're careful. We can apply some

377
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.500
of these things into our daily lives because

378
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.700
here's the reality God is just right God it is part

379
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.200
of his nature is just meaning he's right.

380
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.700
He sets the world to work in a certain way a

381
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.500
right way.

382
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.300
And so we can align things as

383
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.400
best we can with what God says is right and that's gonna

384
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.400
work whether they're Bible verses for laws or not. It's

385
00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.100
still inherently is right and wrong according to

386
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.300
what God says, right.

387
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.600
So we can we can pull those things in even in

388
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.800
the world. We live in.

389
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:00.800
carefully

390
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.700
But again, we can think first and foremost.

391
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.700
About this super nation that we are a

392
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:09.800
part of.

393
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.000
and if God's people who were his kingdom people

394
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.000
were judged

395
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.400
or at the very least discipline by the Lord for

396
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.900
what they were doing like shouldn't we want to avoid that?

397
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.100
I know we talked disciplines good.

398
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.000
But don't we want to avoid discipline? I mean

399
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.100
we want to avoid it if we can't we don't learn the principles before we get to the

400
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.300
discipline. That's good. We want to avoid that. So how do we do that? How

401
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.500
do we avoid what this judgment on them was?

402
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.500
What it was coming to them. How do we avoid this today?

403
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.200
So I see four at least four ways from

404
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.800
just this chapter that we can utilize

405
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.400
in our lives to avoid this

406
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.900
kind of thing happening for us.

407
00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:57.300
first

408
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.400
We must defend the image of God.

409
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.000
We must defend the image of God.

410
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.800
You saw it with these leaders, right?

411
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.200
It says they were eating up.

412
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.600
Eating up the people.

413
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.000
Because what they did is they saw these people merely as

414
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.300
resources to consume not people

415
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.000
to cherish.

416
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.400
They were resources to consume not people

417
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.500
to cherish. Is that not the same thing that's

418
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.000
happening in our society today?

419
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.700
Where where people become resources?

420
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.800
things to be used

421
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.200
instead of treated as the reflections of God

422
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.400
that they actually are.

423
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.200
Here's what I mean.

424
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.200
Just think of the consumer society that we live in.

425
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.500
Where companies use the sexualized body

426
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.700
to sell everything from soap to hamburgers to appliances.

427
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.000
It's a thing to be used to be

428
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.700
consumed.

429
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:19.200
Even children are manipulated psychologically by

430
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.800
companies through advertisements and commercials

431
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.300
so that they are forcing their parents to buy

432
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:24.800
more stuff.

433
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.000
all in there

434
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.700
because that's a that's a thing to be consumed.

435
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.800
the multi-billion dollar pornography industry

436
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.000
It results from consumer demand.

437
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.600
Where it depicts human beings as objects to satisfy

438
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.200
your desires.

439
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.300
We have first-person shooters and

440
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.900
other violent video games.

441
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.200
Where a person gets numb to the reality that

442
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.200
walking around shooting image Bears is not okay.

443
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.300
Because it's a thing.

444
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.300
You have professional athletes destroying their

445
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.600
bodies for fame and for money. You have all and then

446
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.100
Then you have abortion.

447
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.600
Which often targets ethnic minorities?

448
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:31.900
the poor

449
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.100
and people who live in Edmond who want to keep up a perfect image.

450
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.700
Now I know.

451
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.300
As I talk about this there are a few triggers

452
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.200
and people's hearts right now. And so I

453
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:50.400
want to

454
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.600
I know there's extenuating circumstances. We can talk through those that's

455
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.300
Reality, and I want you to hear me.

456
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.400
Very clearly if you have had an abortion or been

457
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.800
involved in abortion in any way.

458
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.700
Your loved here.

459
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.900
Jesus loves you.

460
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.200
Don't have to stay in the shame.

461
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.100
You don't have to stay hidden.

462
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.400
He wants to heal you.

463
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.500
He wants to walk out of that and you walk and

464
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.100
wholeness again, he doesn't want you to feel the regret and

465
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.200
shame anymore. He wants to love you out of it. And that's

466
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.300
what we want to be about too. So as I talk about this, that's

467
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.100
what I hope you hear.

468
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.200
But it's a result that very thing is a

469
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:43.700
result.

470
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.600
of a culture who values convenience and

471
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600
freedom above

472
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.600
The value of that life supposedly safe inside

473
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.300
the mother's womb.

474
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.000
Here's the reality.

475
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.400
a consumer society that abuses

476
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.200
the image of God

477
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.000
will eventually consume itself.

478
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.600
And God will not stand idly by at

479
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.400
the violation of his moral order.

480
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:22.800
he is just

481
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.200
he will bring Justice.

482
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.000
That's why we must be different Church.

483
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.500
That's why we as his people must be different. We

484
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.500
must defend the image of God in all people. We must

485
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.300
treat them fairly treat them equally, it must be

486
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.500
Justice. That's one of our values compelling love. It

487
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.400
starts with this reality that we demonstrate the love of Jesus

488
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.900
by treating everyone and respecting the

489
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.200
Dignity of every person.

490
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.500
It's Genesis 1:27 all people created an

491
00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:58.800
image of God.

492
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.200
I know that that image is Tainted by sin, but

493
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:03.900
it's still there.

494
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.400
It's still in every person so we

495
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.200
ought to treat everyone like that's true.

496
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.400
As God wants them to be treated again. That's Justice. What

497
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.300
does God want us to do with that person? That's right living.

498
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.800
So that means we don't play favorites.

499
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.100
That means we're Fair. We're Equitable. We're we're

500
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.500
looking out for the wealthy and for the poor we're

501
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.800
looking out for the babies. And for the elderly we're looking

502
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.200
out for every ethnicity. We're carrying deeply

503
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.200
for people because that's the way God says it works.

504
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.800
Because every person has the image of God.

505
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.500
So we as his people must defend the

506
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.700
image of God in every person.

507
00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.700
Doesn't mean we agree with everything everybody does but we defend and we

508
00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.300
look for the way to love them the

509
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.600
best as God says.

510
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.000
That's the first way we can avoid this.

511
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.900
Second we must hold leaders accountable.

512
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.500
We must hold leaders accountable.

513
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.400
Now we could Venture into the the line of Civic leaders

514
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.800
here and there'd be much to apply over there. Of course, yes, but

515
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.700
but we're going to stick primarily with this super Nation side

516
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.800
with the church here kind of that world as

517
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.400
we apply this first.

518
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.600
Because remember in in Micah Theocratic era.

519
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.200
There were unwise evil religious leaders

520
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.200
who were consuming people. They were greedy. They

521
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.100
thought there was no consequences for their

522
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.900
actions. They just did it because it was in their hearts to

523
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.600
do it. Do we not see similar things happening in churches all

524
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.700
around us today in America?

525
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.100
Around the world too. Like this is the church at large. We

526
00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.300
see some pastors abusing their Privileges and getting

527
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.900
rich off of their people.

528
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.100
Or sexually exploiting church members and covering it

529
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:08.200
up.

530
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.500
You see Larger than Life figures.

531
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.200
Who who are promoted as king-like and

532
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.100
they're untouchable?

533
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.900
It's because they're so successful.

534
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.700
When behind the scenes they're acting worse than unbelievers.

535
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.200
Like this cannot be Church.

536
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.300
Integrity not matter

537
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.300
Integrity matters along with that we must

538
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.800
also not idolize leaders where we Elevate

539
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.900
them to an unhealthy place.

540
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.800
Listen, the realities that none of us can be above accountability.

541
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:56.600
none of us

542
00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.400
Not me. Not you. Not anybody. We are not above accountability if

543
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.600
I'm walking in sin.

544
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.300
Then I must be humbly willing as anyone else

545
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.300
should be to repent and to humble myself to

546
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:08.800
make it right.

547
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.600
Someone should be able to come to me and say here's what

548
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.200
I saw. Here's what I said what I I'm

549
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.600
recognizing in your life and and I have to be willing to receive

550
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.000
that and be accountable to that.

551
00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.700
I'm not above a standard. You're not above a standard. No one is.

552
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.400
We also look at this and we see these false prop.

553
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.800
We're In It merely for the income

554
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.400
For the prestige they were building their own little K kingdoms, right?

555
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.300
They were they were wanting to have selfish desires fulfilled

556
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.300
by this position. But the reality is

557
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.700
faithful church leaders must be in it for the Lord. That's

558
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:48.800
it.

559
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.600
No other reason.

560
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.500
Because think about these guys, they weren't saying things because this person

561
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.500
paid him certain amounts of money. They weren't saying the right thing. It

562
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.300
must be no matter the cost. These prophets had

563
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.400
to speak God's word.

564
00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.200
We must do what God says to do

565
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.100
no matter what it costs us.

566
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.600
That's why we put spiritual qualifications as primary.

567
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.300
Above whether somebody can preach or sing or

568
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.200
whatever else it's spiritual qualifications first and foremost. That's

569
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.700
absolutely number one.

570
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.600
Because we see selfish leadership equals terrible outcomes,

571
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.000
right?

572
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:36.500
We must be willing.

573
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.400
to hold accountable

574
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.000
and be held accountable.

575
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.200
according to God's standard

576
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.800
There's a third way we avoid God's judgment.

577
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.000
We Proclaim God's full word.

578
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.400
Third we Proclaim God's full word.

579
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.700
so remember here in Micah 3

580
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.300
these leaders wrongly assumed that nothing was wrong.

581
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.300
They're all good.

582
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.000
God's on our side

583
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600
many people around us

584
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.400
have similar wrong beliefs about God and about

585
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:20.900
how life works.

586
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.600
And they believe these things because a generally

587
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.200
religious culture allows people to kind of walk down that road.

588
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.000
But also because they probably had a leader at some point in their

589
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:34.800
life. Tell them this.

590
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.700
And this is true. This is the way it is.

591
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.000
Let me give you a couple examples.

592
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.000
We have people who have grown up believing that baptism guarantees

593
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.700
your salvation. No matter

594
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.700
how far from God you walk the rest of your life.

595
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.000
We have people.

596
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.400
Who say God Bless America with zeal?

597
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.000
Yet every day go out and live selfish unjust

598
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.800
immoral lives.

599
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.500
We have people who have been duped into believing that church attendance and

600
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.600
giving money will result in God's hundred-fold blessing

601
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.100
in your life.

602
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.500
you'll get rich if you give

603
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.300
we have people who believe that if they voted one certain way in

604
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.600
the election, then God certainly loves them.

605
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.300
And he doesn't love the other side.

606
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.800
We have people who believe that if they're just a good person then certainly

607
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.400
nothing bad will ever happen in their lives and how

608
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.600
could bad things happen to good people?

609
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.200
every one of those

610
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.700
And many many more have missed the overall

611
00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.400
picture of what it means to please

612
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:00.700
God.

613
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.400
We've made it something it's not that's

614
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.400
why here we go.

615
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.000
That's why we dig into God's full word.

616
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.300
That's why we dig into even the hard stuff the parts about

617
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.500
God's judgment even not just God's blessing

618
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.100
where everything's good. Everything's fine. And and you're gonna be a conqueror

619
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.100
and you're gonna be doing it all great. Like that's not

620
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.600
we have to also talk about his holy character his holy nature.

621
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.000
This is who he is. That's why we preach through the

622
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.200
whole series about Jesus in his character at

623
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.000
the beginning the year who he was is and always will be we need

624
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.100
to see who he is. We need to see The Parables teach us about

625
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.500
the kingdom of God that is radically different than our kingdom here. We

626
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.600
need to see my cat tell us who God is and our

627
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.600
response to him. That's why we do this because it

628
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.400
gives us to an understanding of who God is

629
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.300
Which then leads us to better understand who we are in light

630
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:52.500
of that.

631
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.400
And it leads us to see that aligning our lives with

632
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.900
What God Says goes. How his his standard

633
00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.400
is that's the way life works best.

634
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.200
That's why we need to see what his word says, even if

635
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.400
it leads us to difficulties and struggles that's best.

636
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.600
Because we're aligned with God.

637
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.400
Listen, that's the nature of faith.

638
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.600
That's called Faith, right?

639
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.500
Where we say?

640
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.200
God your ways better than mine and I'm trusting you

641
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.300
that no matter what comes this this pathway. You're asking

642
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.100
me to walk. I will follow you.

643
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:34.800
It's faith.

644
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.200
Which in fact is what Hebrews 11:6 says?

645
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:42.900
Please God.

646
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.000
Without faith. It is impossible to please him.

647
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.900
Faith is what starts this?

648
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.200
For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he

649
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.500
exists. That's faith and that he rewards those who seek Him

650
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.700
meaning. I'm going to seek God in faith, and

651
00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.100
he's going to give me what I need.

652
00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.600
I have to believe him and trust him and have faith in him to

653
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:07.800
follow him.

654
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.200
but I'm going to

655
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.000
we only get that kind of stuff.

656
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.400
Because the rest of Hebrews 11 shows us some pretty hard things

657
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.200
people walk through because of faith we only get there when we

658
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.700
talk about God's whole full word.

659
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.200
That's why church we must speak only what

660
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.900
God has said and all that. God has said.

661
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.400
It's a good way to think about it speak only what

662
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.300
God has said and all that. God has said that will

663
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.200
lead us to please him and to rightly believe what

664
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.200
we should believe about him.

665
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.100
But there's one more.

666
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.400
One more way to avoid this judgment that

667
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.400
Mike declares in chapter 3.

668
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.900
It goes back to what he's rights in verse 8.

669
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.200
Remember he had just talked about these false prophets?

670
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.400
How they're going to go dark.

671
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:06.700
shame

672
00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.500
Verse 8, but as for me Micah says I

673
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.000
am filled with power.

674
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.800
With the spirit of the Lord with Justice and

675
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.300
might to declare to Jacob his

676
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.200
transgression and to Israel his sin.

677
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.200
Now don't misunderstand what Micah's doing. He's not standing back here in

678
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.400
judgment and arrogance over God's people. He's standing there in

679
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.500
Humble boldness. Why because he's filled

680
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.400
with God's spirit.

681
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.400
That's what led him to say what he said. That's what led him in

682
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.600
his original call to be a prophet. He felt this

683
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.600
feeling of humble boldness because God said,

684
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.700
here's what you're going to do.

685
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.400
And he knew my whole life is to please God and he

686
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.900
was filled with his Spirit to do one thing. You saw what he said.

687
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.700
to Proclaim to God's people What God Says and even

688
00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.300
if that includes sin and transgression

689
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.400
That judgments coming. He was supposed to say what God

690
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.200
Said.

691
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.200
That's why God says I'm going to bring you power to do it.

692
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.300
I'm gonna give you the power to do this role when

693
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.600
couple that with verse 8 when he says might

694
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.300
He says Hey Micah, I'm gonna give you everything you need to do

695
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.200
this hard task. I'm calling you to do. It's very similar to

696
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.000
what God told Jeremiah and Jeremiah 1:17 through

697
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.600
19. He says you Jeremiah and

698
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.900
this is calling Jeremiah as a prophet. He says.

699
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.600
You dress yourself for work.

700
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.300
The original King James said gird up your loins,

701
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.100
which is a weird way to say that I don't know if we talk like that

702
00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.600
anymore, but this is what he said dress yourself or get after the task.

703
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.100
I've called you to dress yourself for work

704
00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.200
prepare arise and say to them everything I command you.

705
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.300
Even the hard stuff.

706
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.300
Do not be dismayed by them lest. I dismay you

707
00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.800
before them. Meaning it's going to be hard don't be dismayed because

708
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.900
Verse 18 I will make you this day a

709
00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.400
fortified City an iron pillar bronze walls

710
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.300
against the whole land against the kings of

711
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.500
Judah. It's officials. It's priests and the people of the land right

712
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.700
just like Micah. He's facing these leaders who

713
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.200
are opposing everything he's saying and he's saying

714
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.400
What God Says

715
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.700
verse 19 they will fight against you.

716
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.000
But they shall not Prevail against you.

717
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.800
And see why.

718
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.200
For I'm with you.

719
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.400
God says to Jeremiah, it's gonna be hard you're gonna say some

720
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.400
hard things. They're gonna hate you.

721
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.100
I'm with you.

722
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.700
I Am with You declares the Lord to deliver you.

723
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.600
As a prophet of God Jeremiah knew he's

724
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.400
facing hard time. Micah knows he's facing

725
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.400
opposition and he says, okay.

726
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.700
God says, okay. I got you.

727
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.400
I'm gonna give you power mind give you everything you need to fulfill the

728
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.300
calling. I've called you to fulfill and that's the same

729
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.600
thing for you and me Church.

730
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.400
Because Micah says filled with the spirit mean I'm

731
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.600
filled with power and might to do this same thing

732
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.500
second Timothy 1 7. God gave

733
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.300
us not a spirit of fear.

734
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:18.900
but of power

735
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.300
and love and self-control

736
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.500
spirit of God brings power to fulfill

737
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.300
this call, but notice in verse 8 that filling the

738
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.800
spirit didn't just bring power. It also brought Justice in

739
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.500
Micah's life.

740
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.500
What that filling of the spirit did for Micah see now understood

741
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.300
God's right way how things should work and he began

742
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.100
to apply it in his life and other people's lives around him.

743
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:45.800
the same for us today

744
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.400
as we are filled with God's spirit which

745
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.100
by the way happens at conversion.

746
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.200
You're you're planted the the seed of The

747
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.200
Inheritance to come as planted in you called the spirit of God.

748
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.400
You have the spirit and you're more filled with the spirit

749
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.100
throughout your life as you submit control.

750
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.300
You are filled more and more and

751
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.400
more where he's in charge and you're not.

752
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.500
As that happens you begin to align yourself with

753
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.300
God's plan and you begin to help other people align themselves with

754
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:22.800
God's plan.

755
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.100
It's Justice.

756
00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.300
You're filled with Justice as you look more like

757
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.500
him and you help other people look more like him as

758
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.500
well. That's God's standard. Not your extra biblical

759
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.400
concerns. That's not your pet issues. You're not aligning people

760
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.800
to those things. You're aligning people to God's

761
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.900
right way.

762
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.600
How to love people well according to his way that's

763
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.700
what we are filled with the spirit to do.

764
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.800
And that church is the leadership.

765
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.200
that we need

766
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.100
Spirit-filled

767
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.100
Standing for the right ways.

768
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:04.600
willing to

769
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.900
powerfully call out sin as needed.

770
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.000
That's what we need to be about and every one of us need to

771
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.100
be about that. Not just those who are up here leading those teachers every

772
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.600
one of us because here's the reality you're leading somebody.

773
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.700
Every one of you has somebody that's following you

774
00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.800
and you're leading them. Either to God's standard.

775
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.000
Or away from God's standard.

776
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.300
so high call

777
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.100
but God's called this an empowered us to do it.

778
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.700
I want to dress one more thing though today.

779
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.600
Says I've talked about all this today. I've been talking about church leaders religious

780
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.200
leaders and

781
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.500
And I know that some of you.

782
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.800
Have been hurt by leaders.

783
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.100
In a church somewhere in the

784
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:02.500
past.

785
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.200
50 years ago 20 years ago two years ago.

786
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.800
And listen, I wish I could go back and change that for you.

787
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:21.100
I wish I could go back and restart re-correct

788
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.200
that whatever happened the way you felt. I wish

789
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.200
I wish I could do that.

790
00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:28.200
can't

791
00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.300
and so as I was praying through and writing this

792
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.500
my hope today was that this might bring a measure

793
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.700
of healing for you.

794
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.400
that we I

795
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.200
are trying to seek God's standard.

796
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:50.900
We see it.

797
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.600
challenged by it

798
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.400
Not perfect at it.

799
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.900
but wanting to be

800
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.300
progressing towards this

801
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.900
yet. I also know how trust works.

802
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.200
I trust is really easy to destroy.

803
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.300
And it takes a long time to build.

804
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.000
And so I know with those things that have happened in your past.

805
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.400
there might be

806
00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.000
even you're on your last thread right now

807
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.400
and you don't even trust any church leaders anywhere.

808
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.000
I get it.

809
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:37.800
But hear me.

810
00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.900
Even if you don't trust any anyone.

811
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.900
You can still trust Jesus.

812
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.200
He's the perfect leader that you need.

813
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.500
He will always do things the right way.

814
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.000
And he will never let you down.

815
00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.900
You might not understand it might hurt. He will never let you down.

816
00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.600
Because listen he went through something very similar.

817
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.300
first Peter

818
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:12.000
chapter 2 verses 21 through 24 describes Jesus going

819
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.300
through something like it.

820
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.300
Innocent but attacked

821
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.100
Listen to his example.

822
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.600
And then the result for to this you've been called because Christ also

823
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.200
suffered for you leaving you an example so that

824
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.800
you might follow in his steps.

825
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.500
Notice how you are to follow he committed. No sin

826
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.600
neither was deceit found in his mouth. He's innocent when

827
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.100
he was reviled. He did not revile in return.

828
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.400
When he suffered he did not threaten, but he

829
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.400
continued here it is. He continued in trusting

830
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.400
himself to him who judges justly.

831
00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.400
Wrongly accused wrongly attacked and he says father you're

832
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.700
gonna you're gonna start this out.

833
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.800
You are the perfect judge. You will take care of this in

834
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.200
your time in your way. All I'm

835
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.300
called to is to be faithful.

836
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.500
And look at the result.

837
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.400
24 he himself bore our

838
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.500
sins in his body on the tree that we

839
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.900
might die to sin and live to righteousness by

840
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.700
his wounds. You have been healed.

841
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.600
No matter what has happened to you.

842
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.000
No matter what you've done.

843
00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.400
Because of the cross of Jesus his life death and Resurrection,

844
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.100
you are healed if you place your faith in him.

845
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.800
There's no more shame. There's no more suffering. Eternally

846
00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.400
you are in him. That's

847
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.600
what that means. So keep trusting him.

848
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.300
You don't trust anybody yet. Trust him keep trusting him

849
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.300
put your life in the hands or the one who knows it all

850
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.400
and he's gonna fix it all.

851
00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.300
Trust him keep trusting him.

852
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.600
Hang on to him. You you are going to get hurt again at

853
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.100
some point. Keep trusting him.

854
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.500
Don't let go of Jesus because he's letting he's

855
00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.500
not letting go of you. He's holding on to you. So don't

856
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:11.700
let

857
00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.300
go keep trusting.

858
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.500
And trusting and keep trusting him and then church. Let's be about

859
00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.600
this kind of Lifestyle.

860
00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:22.400
That Micah describes against let's be

861
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.100
the opposite.

862
00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.200
Let's be a church. That's safe.

863
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.600
Must be a church that loves people deeply.

864
00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:33.800
sacrificially

865
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:37.900
Let's be a church.

866
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:39.700
that knows

867
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.700
our leader deeply

868
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.500
and live differently because of it.
