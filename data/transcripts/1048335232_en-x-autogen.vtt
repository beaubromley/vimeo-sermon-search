1
00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:23.545
Turn with me in your Bibles to one Samuel Chapter 19,

2
00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:27.305
one Samuel Chapter 19.

3
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:31.625
And stand with me if you're able

4
00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.625
for the reading of God's word.

5
00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:34.865
I

6
00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:44.145
And Saul spoke to Jonathan, his son,

7
00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:47.905
and to all his servants that they should kill David.

8
00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:52.305
But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David

9
00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:57.425
and Jonathan told David, Saul, my father seeks to kill you.

10
00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:00.905
And Jonathan told David, Saul, uh,

11
00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:03.145
therefore be on your guard in the morning.

12
00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:05.945
Stay in a secret place and hide yourself.

13
00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.145
And I'll go out and stand beside my father in the field

14
00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:11.665
where you are, and I'll speak to my father about you.

15
00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:14.345
And if I learn anything, I'll tell you.

16
00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:18.265
And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul, his father,

17
00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:21.145
and said to him, let not the king sin

18
00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:22.585
against his servant David.

19
00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:25.025
'cause he has not sinned against you.

20
00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:28.185
And because his deeds have brought good to you

21
00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:31.025
for he took his life in his hand

22
00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:32.585
and he struck down the Philistine.

23
00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:36.945
And the Lord worked a great salvation for all Israel.

24
00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:39.745
You saw it and rejoiced,

25
00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:42.505
why then will you sin against innocent blood

26
00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:44.105
by killing David without cause?

27
00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:49.385
And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, Saul swore

28
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:53.145
as the Lord lives he shall not be put to death.

29
00:01:54.165 --> 00:01:55.465
And Jonathan called David

30
00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:57.945
and Jonathan reported to him all these things.

31
00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:00.825
And Jonathan brought David to Saul

32
00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:03.505
and he was in his presence as

33
00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:06.265
before and there was war again.

34
00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:08.345
And David went out and fought with the Philistines

35
00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:11.665
and struck them with a great blow so

36
00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.105
that they fled before him.

37
00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:17.025
Then a harmful spirit from the Lord came upon Saul

38
00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:20.345
as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand.

39
00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:22.865
And David was playing the liar.

40
00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:27.265
And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear.

41
00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:29.065
But he alluded Saul so

42
00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:32.785
that he struck the spear into the wall and David fled

43
00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:34.305
and escaped that night.

44
00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:39.385
Saul sent, sent messengers to David's house to watch him

45
00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:41.505
that he might kill him in the morning.

46
00:02:42.405 --> 00:02:45.665
But Nicole, David's wife told him, if you do not escape

47
00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:49.465
with your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.

48
00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:52.625
So we call, let David down through the window

49
00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.305
and he fled away and escaped.

50
00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:58.185
We call, took an image and laid it on the bed

51
00:02:58.185 --> 00:03:01.605
and put it, put a pillow of goat's hair at its head

52
00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:03.325
and covered it with his clothes.

53
00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:06.485
And when Saul sent messengers to take David,

54
00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:07.925
he said he is sick.

55
00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:11.605
And Saul sent the messengers to see David saying,

56
00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:14.845
bring him up to me in the bed that I may kill him.

57
00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:17.845
And when the messengers came in,

58
00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:19.925
behold the image was in the bed with the pillow

59
00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:21.445
of goat's hair at its head.

60
00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:26.405
Saul said to McCall, why have you deceived me thus

61
00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:28.925
and let my enemy go so that he has escaped?

62
00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:32.525
And McCall answered Saul, he said to me, let me go.

63
00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:33.685
Why should I kill you?

64
00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:39.545
Now David fled and escaped and he came to Samuel at Rama

65
00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:42.305
and told him all that Saul had done to him.

66
00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:44.825
And he and Samuel went and lived at,

67
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:50.385
and it was told Saul, behold David, uh, is at Naau in Rama.

68
00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:53.555
Then Saul sent messengers to take David.

69
00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:56.995
And when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying

70
00:03:57.415 --> 00:03:59.795
and Samuel standing his head over them, the spirit

71
00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:01.755
of God came upon the messengers of Saul.

72
00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:06.555
And they also prophesied when it was told Saul,

73
00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:10.035
he sent other messengers and they also prophesied.

74
00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:13.955
And Saul sent messengers again a third time,

75
00:04:14.175 --> 00:04:16.315
and they also prophesied.

76
00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:19.035
Then he himself went to Rama

77
00:04:19.035 --> 00:04:20.955
and came to the great well that is in Siku.

78
00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:24.155
And he asked, where are Samuel and David?

79
00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:27.755
And one said, behold they're at auth and Rama.

80
00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:31.875
And he went there to, to auth in Rama.

81
00:04:32.295 --> 00:04:34.795
And the spirit of God came upon him also.

82
00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:40.235
And as he went, he prophesied until he came to Nath in Rama.

83
00:04:40.935 --> 00:04:44.875
And he too stripped off his clothes and he too prophesied

84
00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:48.835
before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night.

85
00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:54.435
Thus it is said, is Saul also among the prophets?

86
00:04:57.265 --> 00:05:01.635
That is the word of the Lord. And you may be seated.

87
00:05:02.365 --> 00:05:07.035
Thank you. Good morning everyone.

88
00:05:07.185 --> 00:05:09.915
It's great to see you on a cold morning

89
00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:12.715
and I'm grateful to God for the warmth we have in here.

90
00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:16.635
Amen. And really, I feel like I'm at home.

91
00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:18.075
Here's a, here's a fun fact.

92
00:05:18.295 --> 00:05:20.915
The the rug that I'm standing on

93
00:05:21.615 --> 00:05:25.115
was in our house in our living room for about a decade.

94
00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:30.275
And so it feels like home. Our, uh, our kids.

95
00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:32.515
We have four kids and they all

96
00:05:33.025 --> 00:05:35.435
grew up playing on this very rug.

97
00:05:35.575 --> 00:05:39.875
Our, our little Noel rolled around as a baby on this rug.

98
00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:42.915
So it's a special thing for me to be up here right now.

99
00:05:44.575 --> 00:05:46.075
I'm grateful to be able to open the Bible

100
00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:47.755
with you this morning as we continue

101
00:05:47.755 --> 00:05:48.915
our study of one Samuel.

102
00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:53.075
My name is Ryan and it's a real joy to be able to serve

103
00:05:53.215 --> 00:05:55.195
as one of your elders here.

104
00:05:55.365 --> 00:05:59.325
Thank you. In the spring of 1940,

105
00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:02.245
the Nazi war machine had

106
00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:07.805
driven over 300,000 allied soldiers

107
00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:10.245
to the very edge of Europe,

108
00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:15.485
trapping them on the beaches of Dunkirk,

109
00:06:16.155 --> 00:06:19.325
blocked in they were facing capture or destruction.

110
00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:24.085
At any moment it seemed like all hope was lost.

111
00:06:24.995 --> 00:06:26.165
They were sitting ducks.

112
00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:32.955
The vast seemingly unstoppable German army were closing in

113
00:06:33.415 --> 00:06:37.555
and the British expeditionary forces were struggling.

114
00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:39.355
They were on the verge of collapse.

115
00:06:42.145 --> 00:06:45.795
Then a desperate call went out across the English channel

116
00:06:46.855 --> 00:06:50.795
and hundreds of vessels, lifeboats,

117
00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:55.155
merchant ships, pleasure boats, fishing boats,

118
00:06:55.935 --> 00:06:58.875
all joined the struggling royal Navy.

119
00:07:00.895 --> 00:07:05.875
And for days this ragtag fleet of vessels braved

120
00:07:06.515 --> 00:07:10.115
treacherous waters, dodging near constant barrage

121
00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:11.235
of enemy fire.

122
00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:17.145
Yet inexplicably Hitler had ordered his armored

123
00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:21.185
divisions to halt, giving some amount

124
00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:22.425
of relief here.

125
00:07:23.525 --> 00:07:28.065
And also incredibly a dense fog rolled in,

126
00:07:30.585 --> 00:07:34.795
casting an immense shadow over the soldiers, hiding them

127
00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:39.875
from the deadly error attacks from the loft vfa.

128
00:07:42.005 --> 00:07:45.505
And what's more the normally turbulent sea became

129
00:07:45.845 --> 00:07:47.025
as glass.

130
00:07:48.405 --> 00:07:51.545
And then for nine long days the miracle unfolded

131
00:07:52.495 --> 00:07:56.985
over 338,000 soldiers

132
00:07:57.295 --> 00:08:00.665
were rescued from the jaws of defeat.

133
00:08:01.745 --> 00:08:05.965
And Winston Churchill himself declared this to be a

134
00:08:06.715 --> 00:08:09.685
deliverance, a miracle of deliverance.

135
00:08:12.085 --> 00:08:14.105
And so today we're picking up at one Samuel 19

136
00:08:14.105 --> 00:08:17.345
where King Saul's paranoia explodes

137
00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:20.465
and David becomes the target of

138
00:08:21.025 --> 00:08:23.185
multiple attempts on his life.

139
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.055
And in the end,

140
00:08:28.505 --> 00:08:32.455
every attempt ends in a miracle of deliverance.

141
00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:39.095
Why? Because God protects his anointed ones.

142
00:08:39.955 --> 00:08:42.295
And that's the main line of this text this morning

143
00:08:42.295 --> 00:08:45.815
that God protects his anointed ones.

144
00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:50.445
John showed us last week from chapter 18

145
00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:53.605
how Saul's jealousy had led him to hurl spears

146
00:08:53.605 --> 00:08:57.125
and to engineer military traps to try and kill David.

147
00:08:58.545 --> 00:09:01.885
And here in chapter 19, the hostility toward David

148
00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:06.685
has moved from covert to overt.

149
00:09:07.905 --> 00:09:12.325
His hatred of David is out in the open. It's plain to see.

150
00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.245
We will study four episodes this morning,

151
00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:19.725
each spotlighting a fresh attempt on David's life.

152
00:09:21.055 --> 00:09:23.825
Hang around you won't believe episode four.

153
00:09:26.225 --> 00:09:27.795
Then we'll close with three points

154
00:09:27.855 --> 00:09:29.115
of application this morning.

155
00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:31.875
But before we begin, let's pray we need it.

156
00:09:34.535 --> 00:09:38.675
Father, your word enlightens our eyes.

157
00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:42.555
Holy Spirit shine light on your word this morning so

158
00:09:42.555 --> 00:09:46.955
that we might glorify Christ and enjoy him more fully

159
00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:49.075
and it's in Christ and we pray.

160
00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:53.115
Amen. So in verse one,

161
00:09:53.185 --> 00:09:54.275
episode one starts,

162
00:09:54.335 --> 00:09:59.035
and we'll call this episode the one where Jonathan talks,

163
00:09:59.345 --> 00:10:03.715
Saul down the one where Jonathan talks, Saul down

164
00:10:05.295 --> 00:10:07.555
and we open with Saul instructing Jonathan

165
00:10:07.615 --> 00:10:10.355
and his servants to kill David.

166
00:10:12.275 --> 00:10:13.855
So there's no more subtlety here.

167
00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:18.015
Saul is done concealing his hatred of David.

168
00:10:19.075 --> 00:10:21.535
And you can imagine Saul throwing a map down

169
00:10:21.595 --> 00:10:23.695
and really enjoying this time, plotting

170
00:10:23.695 --> 00:10:26.495
and scheming against David yet.

171
00:10:26.555 --> 00:10:30.135
And yet Jonathan delighted much in David.

172
00:10:30.395 --> 00:10:34.175
It says, and you'll remember that Jonathan is Saul's son,

173
00:10:34.875 --> 00:10:37.775
but he loves David and he understands

174
00:10:37.775 --> 00:10:40.775
and sees that he is God's chosen.

175
00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.915
And Jonathan is yielding his own claim to the throne here.

176
00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:51.155
So when it seems like David's stuck in second gear

177
00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:54.665
and when it hasn't been his day, his week, his month,

178
00:10:54.665 --> 00:10:58.945
or even his year, Jonathan is there for him, right?

179
00:11:00.605 --> 00:11:03.305
So Jonathan warns David in verse two.

180
00:11:04.055 --> 00:11:07.265
Saul, my father seeks to kill you.

181
00:11:08.495 --> 00:11:10.145
Then Jonathan courageously speaks

182
00:11:10.145 --> 00:11:12.545
to Saul on David's behalf in verse four,

183
00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:17.025
let not the the king sin against the servant David.

184
00:11:18.515 --> 00:11:20.615
And take note there, Jonathan is appealing

185
00:11:20.615 --> 00:11:22.295
to his dad's kingship

186
00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.175
and he's calling out sin for what it is.

187
00:11:25.605 --> 00:11:27.935
It's sin what sin?

188
00:11:28.045 --> 00:11:32.535
Well we see in Deuteronomy 1910, this is the sin of shedding

189
00:11:33.215 --> 00:11:34.215
innocent blood.

190
00:11:36.805 --> 00:11:38.745
In verse five, Jonathan Hermine saw

191
00:11:38.805 --> 00:11:42.825
how David risked his life going up against Goliath

192
00:11:43.405 --> 00:11:48.305
and how the Lord worked a great salvation for all Israel.

193
00:11:48.485 --> 00:11:51.225
It says, in other words,

194
00:11:52.405 --> 00:11:53.685
why would you kill the man

195
00:11:53.705 --> 00:11:55.765
who brought you such great benefit?

196
00:11:56.625 --> 00:11:59.725
And to all the nation it doesn't make sense.

197
00:12:01.685 --> 00:12:06.085
Surprisingly, Saul relent momentarily.

198
00:12:06.905 --> 00:12:09.325
And notice that I don't say repent.

199
00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:15.325
Saul swears in verse six, as the Lord lives

200
00:12:15.865 --> 00:12:17.605
he shall not be put to death.

201
00:12:18.345 --> 00:12:21.765
So David returns to the palace as

202
00:12:21.865 --> 00:12:26.245
before it says, But you can feel the tension here.

203
00:12:27.305 --> 00:12:28.965
Has Saul truly changed?

204
00:12:30.685 --> 00:12:33.345
The truth is that this vow that David won't die

205
00:12:35.495 --> 00:12:40.325
rings hollow if the inner envy remains still,

206
00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:45.405
God protects his anointed ones this time

207
00:12:45.405 --> 00:12:49.645
through Jonathan's well chosen words and the credits roll.

208
00:12:50.305 --> 00:12:54.125
And that's episode one. Episode two.

209
00:12:54.125 --> 00:12:58.805
We'll call this the one where the spear sends David running

210
00:12:59.105 --> 00:13:03.765
for a long time, one where the spear sends David running

211
00:13:03.785 --> 00:13:06.725
for a long time and we shift scenes.

212
00:13:07.535 --> 00:13:11.605
Verse eight, we see that David fights the Philistines again

213
00:13:12.185 --> 00:13:14.405
and wins handily again.

214
00:13:15.465 --> 00:13:16.485
And that melody

215
00:13:16.585 --> 00:13:20.645
of the old refrained slain Saul has slain his thousands.

216
00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:24.685
But David, his 10 thousands is likely floating

217
00:13:24.685 --> 00:13:27.165
around there in the background.

218
00:13:27.785 --> 00:13:30.885
And so Saul Stews

219
00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:36.085
in dark jealousy verse five says

220
00:13:36.085 --> 00:13:38.725
that a harmful spirit from the Lord torments him.

221
00:13:39.755 --> 00:13:41.085
What is this harmful spirit?

222
00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:43.365
This harmful spirit can be seen

223
00:13:43.505 --> 00:13:48.085
as God's judgment against Saul for opposing God.

224
00:13:49.905 --> 00:13:51.235
This isn't the Holy Spirit.

225
00:13:52.795 --> 00:13:55.935
One commentary frames Saul's frame of mind like this

226
00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:59.695
that his fear and his jealousy ran so deep

227
00:13:59.695 --> 00:14:03.655
that he couldn't even sit in his house without his hand

228
00:14:03.765 --> 00:14:05.375
clutching a spear.

229
00:14:08.225 --> 00:14:11.645
So David is just being David, he's playing his harp.

230
00:14:12.345 --> 00:14:15.565
And then out of nowhere, Saul hurls a spear at him.

231
00:14:16.175 --> 00:14:19.445
Verse 10, he sought to pin David to the wall,

232
00:14:20.905 --> 00:14:23.935
David Dodges and the sear the spear sinks

233
00:14:24.445 --> 00:14:26.695
into splintering wood.

234
00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:31.185
David flees at night never again

235
00:14:31.285 --> 00:14:33.745
to live in Saul's house again.

236
00:14:35.915 --> 00:14:38.735
So no matter Saul's rage, God upholds David.

237
00:14:39.755 --> 00:14:42.335
And you don't see this immediately in the text,

238
00:14:42.635 --> 00:14:43.695
but this is significant.

239
00:14:44.305 --> 00:14:45.855
Don't miss this. This is where

240
00:14:46.435 --> 00:14:50.655
the story really shifts gears here from here on out,

241
00:14:50.785 --> 00:14:52.965
David is a fugitive.

242
00:14:54.975 --> 00:14:56.235
So this is chapter 19.

243
00:14:56.385 --> 00:15:00.595
He's on the run all the way through chapter 30,

244
00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:04.935
and it only really ends here.

245
00:15:05.445 --> 00:15:07.215
Spoiler alert, close your ears

246
00:15:07.215 --> 00:15:08.375
if you don't want to hear this yet.

247
00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:12.215
But it only really ends when Saul is killed in battle

248
00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.295
with the Philistines in chapter 31.

249
00:15:16.275 --> 00:15:20.335
But as we'll see that this was a decade long ultra marathon,

250
00:15:21.285 --> 00:15:24.855
doesn't mean that God's plan was faltering in any way.

251
00:15:27.265 --> 00:15:31.085
And he might be wondering, why doesn't God just remove Saul

252
00:15:31.545 --> 00:15:35.925
and put David up as king instead of this 10 year runaround?

253
00:15:36.265 --> 00:15:40.735
That's a good question. Scripture repeatedly shows

254
00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:45.815
that God refines his people through hardships.

255
00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:51.335
And this extended wilderness time for David

256
00:15:51.885 --> 00:15:55.735
becomes like his crucible, forging him

257
00:15:56.275 --> 00:15:58.215
in humility and dependence

258
00:15:58.595 --> 00:16:02.335
and readiness to shepherd God's people.

259
00:16:04.025 --> 00:16:08.495
Check this out. Psalm 63, you can feel his hunger

260
00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:11.855
for God and see his humility.

261
00:16:14.305 --> 00:16:16.125
Oh God, you are my God.

262
00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:20.325
Earnestly I seek you my soul thirsts for you.

263
00:16:21.265 --> 00:16:23.565
My flesh faints for you and it as in a dry

264
00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:25.165
and weary land where there is no water.

265
00:16:26.505 --> 00:16:30.525
So I've looked upon you in a sanctuary beholding your power

266
00:16:30.985 --> 00:16:35.485
and glory because your steadfast love is

267
00:16:35.905 --> 00:16:37.325
better than life.

268
00:16:37.785 --> 00:16:42.525
My lips will praise you, so I will bless you

269
00:16:42.825 --> 00:16:45.725
as long as I live in your name.

270
00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:49.205
I will lift up my hands.

271
00:16:51.825 --> 00:16:55.645
So good. This is a heart

272
00:16:56.635 --> 00:16:58.365
refined in the desert.

273
00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:02.875
This is God making a man of God.

274
00:17:05.795 --> 00:17:08.775
God refines his people in the desert.

275
00:17:11.315 --> 00:17:12.725
This anchor of truth remains.

276
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.845
God protects his anointed ones.

277
00:17:15.355 --> 00:17:19.885
Saul Spear has sent David running for a long, long

278
00:17:20.395 --> 00:17:23.485
time and the credits roll

279
00:17:24.345 --> 00:17:26.725
and that's episode two.

280
00:17:27.945 --> 00:17:31.765
Now we come to episode three, we'll call this one the one

281
00:17:31.795 --> 00:17:35.245
with fake David, the one with fake David.

282
00:17:36.785 --> 00:17:39.285
And we open in the darkness outside David's house.

283
00:17:39.395 --> 00:17:43.205
It's in verse 11 that we see that Saul sends messengers

284
00:17:43.465 --> 00:17:46.485
to watch the door planning to kill David at dawn.

285
00:17:47.185 --> 00:17:50.925
But me call David's wife. You remember Saul's daughter?

286
00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:53.405
She warns David, if you do not escape

287
00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.845
with your life tonight, tomorrow

288
00:17:56.865 --> 00:17:58.405
you will be killed.

289
00:17:59.885 --> 00:18:01.825
And we read that in verse 12.

290
00:18:02.205 --> 00:18:05.105
So we call let David down through the window

291
00:18:05.845 --> 00:18:08.265
and he fled away and escaped.

292
00:18:09.565 --> 00:18:11.825
And this reminds us of other window escapes in scripture,

293
00:18:11.825 --> 00:18:15.865
doesn't it, Paul in Damascus and then Rahab

294
00:18:15.925 --> 00:18:17.745
and the spies in Jericho.

295
00:18:20.925 --> 00:18:24.865
And once David's gone, McCall puts a dummy in the bed,

296
00:18:25.525 --> 00:18:28.065
she puts an Ile, a household image.

297
00:18:28.325 --> 00:18:32.775
The Hebrew here is Phim in the bed.

298
00:18:32.795 --> 00:18:34.215
She covers it with clothes, places,

299
00:18:34.315 --> 00:18:35.535
goat's, hair by the head.

300
00:18:36.435 --> 00:18:38.495
And so let's pause here for just a second.

301
00:18:38.635 --> 00:18:42.215
Why is there an idol in David's house? It's a good question.

302
00:18:42.445 --> 00:18:43.895
Well, it probably not.

303
00:18:43.895 --> 00:18:46.975
David's, it seems as if

304
00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:51.445
David is unequally yoked here with Bal.

305
00:18:52.385 --> 00:18:55.405
Bal doesn't appear to be a follower of God.

306
00:18:57.545 --> 00:19:00.125
And when the assassins appear, she says in verse 14,

307
00:19:01.075 --> 00:19:04.785
he's sick, Saul is furious

308
00:19:05.325 --> 00:19:07.225
and he orders them

309
00:19:07.285 --> 00:19:10.065
to bring David in bed if necessary to kill him.

310
00:19:11.215 --> 00:19:12.795
But they uncover the deception.

311
00:19:13.095 --> 00:19:16.955
In verse 16, the image was in the bed.

312
00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:20.715
Saul confronts his daughter who deflects blame

313
00:19:20.735 --> 00:19:24.115
and lies saying that David

314
00:19:24.635 --> 00:19:25.795
threatened to kill her.

315
00:19:28.025 --> 00:19:32.675
Such a relatable story. We've all been there, right?

316
00:19:33.925 --> 00:19:38.555
We've been there. Our father-in-law who also happens

317
00:19:38.555 --> 00:19:42.715
to be our boss, hates us, decides, you know what,

318
00:19:42.735 --> 00:19:43.835
I'm done with that guy.

319
00:19:44.085 --> 00:19:48.005
Let's kill him. You know,

320
00:19:48.005 --> 00:19:49.565
you've probably experienced that before.

321
00:19:51.665 --> 00:19:54.125
And then our wife, she helps us escape out the window.

322
00:19:54.385 --> 00:19:55.845
She just kinda lowers us down

323
00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:58.565
and then puts a statue in the bed, covers it

324
00:19:58.565 --> 00:19:59.685
with goat hair and clothes.

325
00:20:01.145 --> 00:20:04.205
And then the guys, the the murder squad who come

326
00:20:04.205 --> 00:20:05.445
to try and take us out.

327
00:20:08.855 --> 00:20:11.945
They, uh, you know, she, she goes to the door, she's like,

328
00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:14.065
oh, he can't come out.

329
00:20:14.605 --> 00:20:16.185
You know, you, you've understand this, right?

330
00:20:16.895 --> 00:20:18.185
This is a relatable story.

331
00:20:19.175 --> 00:20:23.305
This is something that we've all experienced. All right?

332
00:20:23.325 --> 00:20:25.705
All right. Maybe that's not exactly true.

333
00:20:26.245 --> 00:20:29.465
We haven't experienced this thing, but stay with me here.

334
00:20:30.235 --> 00:20:34.825
Psalm 59 is connected to this story.

335
00:20:35.915 --> 00:20:38.265
Bible headings aren't the inspired word of God,

336
00:20:38.285 --> 00:20:41.385
but some headings note that David

337
00:20:42.715 --> 00:20:45.385
wrote Psalm 59 when Saul sent men

338
00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:46.785
and they watched the house.

339
00:20:48.505 --> 00:20:51.725
By the way, our very young Brent McCoy preached excellently

340
00:20:51.785 --> 00:20:53.365
on the psalm two summers ago.

341
00:20:53.665 --> 00:20:58.445
So check that out while we don't face assassins at dawn,

342
00:20:59.075 --> 00:21:00.805
what we do relate to is the emotion

343
00:21:01.315 --> 00:21:04.045
that David is feeling in this moment.

344
00:21:05.835 --> 00:21:10.535
And I want you to feel this too in verse one of Psalm 59,

345
00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.495
David, pray, deliver me for my enemies.

346
00:21:12.635 --> 00:21:17.565
Oh my God. And this captures the desperation of

347
00:21:17.565 --> 00:21:20.995
that night For all the cunning

348
00:21:21.355 --> 00:21:22.675
watchers that are outside.

349
00:21:22.765 --> 00:21:27.715
David knows that real deliverance has to come from the Lord.

350
00:21:29.625 --> 00:21:32.995
Same psalm verse nine oh my strength.

351
00:21:33.275 --> 00:21:37.635
I will watch for you, for you, oh God are my fortress.

352
00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:41.325
David's desperate here.

353
00:21:42.305 --> 00:21:45.955
Are You desperate right now in something?

354
00:21:48.005 --> 00:21:51.915
If so, mirror David here where he cries out.

355
00:21:51.915 --> 00:21:56.675
He said, oh my strength, I will watch for you,

356
00:21:57.375 --> 00:22:00.275
for you, oh God are my fortress.

357
00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:06.065
This fortresslike protection plays out in real time here.

358
00:22:06.485 --> 00:22:10.505
God uses Nicole's deception to protect David

359
00:22:11.085 --> 00:22:12.985
and to ensure that he remains free.

360
00:22:14.085 --> 00:22:16.905
And to be clear, this isn't some endorsement of lying.

361
00:22:18.165 --> 00:22:19.345
So don't get hung up on that.

362
00:22:20.285 --> 00:22:23.305
We see more of David's heart that night.

363
00:22:23.355 --> 00:22:27.105
Psalm 59 16 reveals, I will sing aloud

364
00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:30.345
of your steadfast love in the morning.

365
00:22:31.445 --> 00:22:34.385
And that is David repeating a biblical truth

366
00:22:34.385 --> 00:22:35.625
that we see in scripture.

367
00:22:36.755 --> 00:22:40.225
David also writes in a different psalm, Psalm 30 verse five,

368
00:22:40.555 --> 00:22:45.385
where he says, weeping may linger for the night,

369
00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:51.385
but joy comes when with the morning.

370
00:22:53.345 --> 00:22:54.525
Joy comes with the morning.

371
00:22:56.385 --> 00:22:59.965
So now my heart isn't to minimize any, any pain

372
00:23:00.515 --> 00:23:02.765
that you may be in right now,

373
00:23:05.855 --> 00:23:08.555
but we're assured this in scripture

374
00:23:10.245 --> 00:23:12.375
suffering is temporary

375
00:23:13.235 --> 00:23:15.935
and joy is guaranteed

376
00:23:17.815 --> 00:23:21.255
ultimately back to the text.

377
00:23:21.285 --> 00:23:22.335
Instead of being killed.

378
00:23:22.575 --> 00:23:26.335
At dawn, David writes about singing to the Lord, testifying

379
00:23:26.335 --> 00:23:27.335
to God's faithfulness.

380
00:23:28.715 --> 00:23:32.655
So episode three ends with me,

381
00:23:32.655 --> 00:23:35.575
call outsmarting Saul's man while David runs for his life.

382
00:23:35.995 --> 00:23:38.735
And with Saul standing furious

383
00:23:38.925 --> 00:23:41.255
that he has been thwarted again.

384
00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:47.285
The main point remains. God protects his anointed ones.

385
00:23:48.795 --> 00:23:50.455
And that is episode three.

386
00:23:51.435 --> 00:23:52.895
So now we come to episode four,

387
00:23:52.925 --> 00:23:54.295
it's the finale in the series.

388
00:23:54.795 --> 00:23:58.335
I'm sad to say we'll call this one the one

389
00:23:58.335 --> 00:24:02.575
where God's spirit turns killers into choir members,

390
00:24:03.765 --> 00:24:05.295
killers into choir members.

391
00:24:05.785 --> 00:24:06.975
Verse 18 shows us

392
00:24:06.975 --> 00:24:09.335
that David flees aama about three miles away.

393
00:24:09.335 --> 00:24:11.055
David confides in Samuel

394
00:24:11.195 --> 00:24:13.695
and the prophet who had anointed him, if you remember.

395
00:24:14.235 --> 00:24:17.575
And they stay at auth. The word auth means dwelling.

396
00:24:17.635 --> 00:24:21.175
So this is likely a place where prophets live.

397
00:24:21.655 --> 00:24:23.895
Shepherds lived a camp of sorts

398
00:24:25.555 --> 00:24:27.455
and these dwellings are within rama.

399
00:24:27.675 --> 00:24:30.575
So Saul learns of David's hideout in verse 19

400
00:24:30.995 --> 00:24:33.095
and then sends messengers once more.

401
00:24:34.195 --> 00:24:39.095
And unlike other episodes where God uses people

402
00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:43.935
to accomplish his purposes, this one is unique.

403
00:24:46.775 --> 00:24:49.625
This time God intervenes directly

404
00:24:50.325 --> 00:24:51.785
and supernaturally.

405
00:24:54.965 --> 00:24:57.425
So as soon as Saul's messengers arrived, verse 20 says

406
00:24:57.425 --> 00:25:00.585
that the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul

407
00:25:00.585 --> 00:25:02.305
and he also prophesied.

408
00:25:03.015 --> 00:25:04.705
They can't seize David

409
00:25:04.705 --> 00:25:08.705
because the Holy Spirit has overwhelmed them.

410
00:25:10.085 --> 00:25:11.745
And Saul's messengers can't help

411
00:25:11.965 --> 00:25:15.665
but join this worship service that's happening.

412
00:25:16.805 --> 00:25:19.145
So it says they prophesied, prophesied doesn't always mean,

413
00:25:19.765 --> 00:25:20.985
uh, predicting the future.

414
00:25:21.655 --> 00:25:25.145
What it can mean is, uh, speaking words from God,

415
00:25:25.755 --> 00:25:29.825
worshiping God, praying to him, singing even.

416
00:25:31.565 --> 00:25:34.665
And so these killers have been turned into choir members.

417
00:25:35.565 --> 00:25:38.145
The second wave of messengers comes same outcome.

418
00:25:38.335 --> 00:25:42.585
Join the choir. Third wave messengers comes. Same thing.

419
00:25:42.935 --> 00:25:46.945
Join the choir. So Saul says, I, I need to do this myself.

420
00:25:47.015 --> 00:25:51.185
Then goes to Rama, ask for directions, continues on.

421
00:25:51.535 --> 00:25:55.265
Then verse 23, the spirit of God came upon him also.

422
00:25:55.525 --> 00:25:58.465
And as he went, he prophesied

423
00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:01.505
and in a scene that's astonishing

424
00:26:01.605 --> 00:26:05.745
and humiliating, verse 24 says, he stripped off his clothes

425
00:26:06.405 --> 00:26:08.705
and he too prophesied before Samuel

426
00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:12.505
and lay naked all that day, all that night.

427
00:26:14.715 --> 00:26:18.015
Now this could mean that he, uh,

428
00:26:18.435 --> 00:26:20.175
became fully unclothed,

429
00:26:21.195 --> 00:26:24.975
but more than likely it's just his royal robe,

430
00:26:24.975 --> 00:26:26.055
his royal garments.

431
00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:31.855
So Saul, he was once so sure of himself, he lies disrobed,

432
00:26:31.935 --> 00:26:34.895
helpless before God's prophet powerless

433
00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:36.655
to do a thing about David.

434
00:26:38.195 --> 00:26:40.005
He's totally humiliated here.

435
00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:46.085
It's as if God can't even stand to have

436
00:26:46.595 --> 00:26:49.565
Saul dressed as king in his presence.

437
00:26:52.285 --> 00:26:54.905
And the text ends on this rhetorical note, is Saul also

438
00:26:54.905 --> 00:26:57.105
among the prophets echoing one Samuel 10.

439
00:26:57.105 --> 00:27:00.105
But now there's a little bit of tragic irony here.

440
00:27:03.085 --> 00:27:07.065
The point here is that he is not truly among the prophets.

441
00:27:08.425 --> 00:27:12.725
So ends our finale, the camera zooms out.

442
00:27:12.915 --> 00:27:14.165
Saul is in disarray.

443
00:27:14.225 --> 00:27:18.605
He is physically humiliated, morally undone.

444
00:27:18.605 --> 00:27:19.925
David is unscathed.

445
00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:25.165
So after four attempts, Saul remains empty handed.

446
00:27:26.065 --> 00:27:30.405
And that main point blasts like a trumpet call.

447
00:27:30.705 --> 00:27:35.365
One more time. God protects his anointed ones.

448
00:27:38.805 --> 00:27:40.265
He can do it through wise friends.

449
00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:44.105
He can do it through quick reflexes, through hairy dummies.

450
00:27:44.645 --> 00:27:47.745
And he can do it through the power of the spirit of God.

451
00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:53.185
None can stand against God's chosen.

452
00:27:54.805 --> 00:27:58.425
So what do we do with these four episodes?

453
00:27:58.495 --> 00:28:00.425
What is the application for us?

454
00:28:01.855 --> 00:28:03.305
Well, it's tempting to stop

455
00:28:03.365 --> 00:28:05.625
and say, well, you know, so what?

456
00:28:05.685 --> 00:28:10.385
We don't have a literal Saul chasing us with a spear.

457
00:28:13.035 --> 00:28:16.105
8.1 billion people.

458
00:28:17.975 --> 00:28:21.885
Maybe there's one or two people, maybe one

459
00:28:21.885 --> 00:28:25.325
or two literal Sas chasing people around with spears.

460
00:28:27.115 --> 00:28:28.825
Let's say 10 tend to be safe,

461
00:28:28.965 --> 00:28:32.025
10 literal Sauls chasing people around with spears.

462
00:28:32.765 --> 00:28:35.905
But for us who don't have literal Saul chasing us,

463
00:28:36.615 --> 00:28:37.625
what is the application?

464
00:28:37.625 --> 00:28:41.825
What we do have the same God that David did.

465
00:28:43.275 --> 00:28:46.015
And uh, it says in James one 17 that

466
00:28:46.045 --> 00:28:50.895
with God there is no variation or shadow due to change.

467
00:28:51.555 --> 00:28:54.735
He does not change ever.

468
00:28:57.035 --> 00:29:01.095
And we also have an even greater anointed one than David,

469
00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:03.375
Jesus the king.

470
00:29:04.745 --> 00:29:06.765
And what do we do with that? That we have the same God

471
00:29:06.825 --> 00:29:09.445
and we have an even greater king than David.

472
00:29:10.955 --> 00:29:12.505
Three points to bring it home.

473
00:29:13.035 --> 00:29:15.865
First, don't oppose to lord's anointed.

474
00:29:17.115 --> 00:29:19.025
Don't oppose the Lord's anointed. That's right.

475
00:29:19.075 --> 00:29:21.105
Don't follow Saul's footsteps

476
00:29:21.325 --> 00:29:23.225
by rejecting the rightful king.

477
00:29:24.535 --> 00:29:26.305
Saul clung to his throne

478
00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:29.945
even though God had chosen David.

479
00:29:30.645 --> 00:29:31.705
And sometimes we do the same.

480
00:29:31.705 --> 00:29:35.185
We dig in our heels against Christ's authority

481
00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:38.385
and that rebellion, it can be subtle.

482
00:29:39.325 --> 00:29:41.365
We may talk a good game about Jesus,

483
00:29:41.505 --> 00:29:45.645
but we haven't given over everything in our life to him,

484
00:29:47.905 --> 00:29:52.245
our our lips honor him, but our hearts are far from him.

485
00:29:52.605 --> 00:29:55.045
Scripture says, and it's like we,

486
00:29:55.105 --> 00:29:57.645
we insist on deciding our morals

487
00:29:58.065 --> 00:30:01.445
or our identity all on our own terms,

488
00:30:02.995 --> 00:30:06.085
whether it's in finances or sexuality or relationships,

489
00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:08.925
or maybe the rebellion is seen as

490
00:30:08.925 --> 00:30:10.765
how we disregard the the value

491
00:30:10.785 --> 00:30:12.165
and the dignity of human life.

492
00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:18.365
Saul's refusal to yield is basically our refusal

493
00:30:18.385 --> 00:30:22.125
to yield to Jesus every area of our life.

494
00:30:24.375 --> 00:30:27.625
It's been said that our arms are too short to box with God.

495
00:30:29.765 --> 00:30:34.265
And if we do try to box with him, we face the same futility

496
00:30:34.655 --> 00:30:39.065
that left Saul humiliated, stripped of control.

497
00:30:41.335 --> 00:30:43.395
So the call is simple, but it's urgent.

498
00:30:44.325 --> 00:30:46.275
Yield the throne to Jesus,

499
00:30:48.885 --> 00:30:52.555
don't oppose the Lord's anointed second

500
00:30:53.665 --> 00:30:55.595
rest confidently in God's protection,

501
00:30:56.185 --> 00:30:58.475
rest confidently in God's protection.

502
00:30:58.655 --> 00:31:00.675
And this point is a lot more comforting

503
00:31:00.865 --> 00:31:01.995
than that one, isn't it?

504
00:31:05.255 --> 00:31:07.075
So we just said that our arms aren't

505
00:31:07.075 --> 00:31:08.155
too short to box with God.

506
00:31:08.155 --> 00:31:10.035
But the greater truth than that is

507
00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:14.715
what we see in Isaiah 59, 1 where it says, behold

508
00:31:15.455 --> 00:31:19.555
the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save.

509
00:31:21.225 --> 00:31:25.355
Meaning his arms aren't too short to save you,

510
00:31:26.335 --> 00:31:30.115
no matter your past or your predicament.

511
00:31:32.845 --> 00:31:34.425
And we see that in this passage, don't we?

512
00:31:34.595 --> 00:31:38.505
God's arms weren't too short that he couldn't save.

513
00:31:38.675 --> 00:31:41.065
David, be encouraged by that.

514
00:31:43.645 --> 00:31:46.745
Notice also in this, that David's protection isn't passive.

515
00:31:47.125 --> 00:31:50.785
He doesn't just sit around and wait for God to rescue him.

516
00:31:52.855 --> 00:31:55.115
No, he flees. He he hides.

517
00:31:55.115 --> 00:31:56.475
He accepts help from other people.

518
00:31:57.855 --> 00:32:01.595
And yet behind all of these human actions, we see

519
00:32:02.445 --> 00:32:06.195
God's sovereign hand at work, don't we?

520
00:32:07.505 --> 00:32:09.605
And that raises an important question for us.

521
00:32:10.425 --> 00:32:14.565
How do we balance taking responsibility for our own safety

522
00:32:14.625 --> 00:32:18.245
and wellbeing with while trusting in God's

523
00:32:18.245 --> 00:32:19.765
providential care for us?

524
00:32:21.485 --> 00:32:23.385
So our passage suggests

525
00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:27.745
that these two things aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.

526
00:32:30.285 --> 00:32:32.985
We are called to be wise and to take action,

527
00:32:34.125 --> 00:32:36.345
but always with the recognition that

528
00:32:36.985 --> 00:32:39.925
ultimate security comes from the Lord.

529
00:32:42.005 --> 00:32:46.845
Proverbs 2131 says, the horse is made ready for the day

530
00:32:46.985 --> 00:32:50.685
of battle, but victory belongs to the Lord.

531
00:32:52.625 --> 00:32:57.245
So even if we face severe trials, God can use ordinary means

532
00:32:58.805 --> 00:33:00.045
episodes one through three

533
00:33:01.305 --> 00:33:05.485
or extraordinary means episode four, to

534
00:33:06.045 --> 00:33:07.045
preserve us.

535
00:33:08.715 --> 00:33:11.375
And you might be right in the middle of a particular pain.

536
00:33:11.435 --> 00:33:12.535
And you're wondering,

537
00:33:15.245 --> 00:33:17.735
this doesn't feel like God is protecting us.

538
00:33:21.075 --> 00:33:25.875
I get it. The weeping lingers

539
00:33:26.135 --> 00:33:29.755
in the dark of the night continues to cover us,

540
00:33:31.575 --> 00:33:36.275
but believer clinging to his word when it testifies this.

541
00:33:37.495 --> 00:33:42.075
And we know, we know that for those

542
00:33:42.075 --> 00:33:46.075
who love God, all things work together for good, for those

543
00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:48.555
who are called according to his purpose.

544
00:33:49.815 --> 00:33:51.195
Romans 8 28 says,

545
00:33:54.125 --> 00:33:56.965
remember the joy that's guaranteed

546
00:33:57.825 --> 00:33:59.325
to come in the morning.

547
00:34:01.195 --> 00:34:05.185
Ultimately in a similar way

548
00:34:05.185 --> 00:34:07.145
that God protected David his anointed,

549
00:34:07.245 --> 00:34:09.905
we too are anointed through the Holy Spirit.

550
00:34:10.205 --> 00:34:13.505
One John two 20 says, as anointed ones, even if

551
00:34:14.125 --> 00:34:18.225
storms battle battle us financially, relationally,

552
00:34:18.225 --> 00:34:22.505
emotionally, our life is secure in Christ.

553
00:34:23.915 --> 00:34:28.185
Colossians three, three says that our life is hidden

554
00:34:28.655 --> 00:34:30.625
with Christ in God.

555
00:34:32.845 --> 00:34:35.895
Rest confidently in God's protection believer

556
00:34:38.695 --> 00:34:40.425
last look ultimately to Christ.

557
00:34:41.215 --> 00:34:42.625
Look ultimately to Christ.

558
00:34:43.405 --> 00:34:47.865
Let David's story point you to the greater David Jesus.

559
00:34:48.725 --> 00:34:51.665
Now what do I mean by greater David? What does that mean?

560
00:34:51.665 --> 00:34:55.465
David is a man after God's own heart clearly,

561
00:34:56.525 --> 00:35:01.145
but his life was pockmarked with success

562
00:35:01.485 --> 00:35:04.985
and with failure, with righteousness

563
00:35:05.165 --> 00:35:08.705
and with sin and the re.

564
00:35:09.565 --> 00:35:13.225
And this reality is that David was a foreshadowing

565
00:35:13.325 --> 00:35:14.425
of the Messiah.

566
00:35:15.355 --> 00:35:17.585
Jesus who lived a perfect life.

567
00:35:18.575 --> 00:35:20.905
Saul trying to kill David echoes

568
00:35:21.045 --> 00:35:23.825
how religious leaders were trying to kill Jesus.

569
00:35:24.885 --> 00:35:28.065
But just as David's destiny couldn't be thwarted,

570
00:35:28.295 --> 00:35:30.145
neither could Christ.

571
00:35:31.575 --> 00:35:36.095
Amen. In for sure their greatest attempt

572
00:35:36.145 --> 00:35:40.965
crucifying him precisely unfolded God's

573
00:35:40.965 --> 00:35:45.085
redemptive plan, culminating in his resurrection

574
00:35:47.095 --> 00:35:49.045
where David was vindicated through survival.

575
00:35:49.255 --> 00:35:52.805
Jesus is vindicated on an eternal scale,

576
00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:56.845
reigning at God's right hand forever.

577
00:35:57.475 --> 00:36:00.925
Ephesians one says, so how do we respond?

578
00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:04.445
We don't just mimic David's escapes.

579
00:36:04.445 --> 00:36:07.405
Here we surrender to Jesus as king.

580
00:36:09.405 --> 00:36:13.625
And if we do, Romans 8 38 assures us that nothing

581
00:36:14.285 --> 00:36:18.785
can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.

582
00:36:20.525 --> 00:36:21.665
So church, what do we know?

583
00:36:22.955 --> 00:36:25.425
Don't oppose the Lord's anointed,

584
00:36:26.055 --> 00:36:30.945
rest in God's protection and look ultimately to Christ.

585
00:36:33.325 --> 00:36:37.425
So as we come to a close, remember the story of

586
00:36:37.975 --> 00:36:41.585
Dunkirk and recall the dense fog

587
00:36:42.095 --> 00:36:46.075
rolling in where the fog covers

588
00:36:46.895 --> 00:36:49.835
and casts hundreds of thousands of

589
00:36:50.435 --> 00:36:53.155
soldiers in immense shadow.

590
00:36:55.285 --> 00:36:59.745
In a similar way, Psalm 91 speaks of the shadow

591
00:37:00.445 --> 00:37:01.465
of the Almighty.

592
00:37:03.705 --> 00:37:06.455
Verse one proclaims that whoever abides

593
00:37:07.035 --> 00:37:11.375
or stays in the shadow of the almighty stands

594
00:37:11.965 --> 00:37:14.455
protected UNT unassailable.

595
00:37:17.215 --> 00:37:18.545
What about David in this chapter,

596
00:37:18.545 --> 00:37:20.785
whether it was watchers at the door

597
00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:25.865
or spears in the palace, David Abided in the shadow

598
00:37:26.085 --> 00:37:29.985
of the Almighty, do you

599
00:37:30.875 --> 00:37:33.865
stand in the shadow of the Almighty

600
00:37:38.165 --> 00:37:41.705
for you and for me, if we belong to Christ,

601
00:37:42.605 --> 00:37:46.625
we too stand in God's protective shadow.

602
00:37:49.565 --> 00:37:51.385
If you sense that you're resisting

603
00:37:51.845 --> 00:37:54.105
or rejecting Jesus as king,

604
00:37:55.685 --> 00:37:58.185
or you're clinging to a throne that you can't keep

605
00:38:01.535 --> 00:38:04.025
hear God's invitation to repent

606
00:38:04.685 --> 00:38:08.985
and believe, surrender the illusions of control

607
00:38:09.805 --> 00:38:11.065
and bow before him.

608
00:38:11.605 --> 00:38:15.825
Why? Because God protects his

609
00:38:16.545 --> 00:38:17.585
anointed ones.

610
00:38:21.405 --> 00:38:24.265
And in the words of Psalm 91, 1 through two, we can leave

611
00:38:25.045 --> 00:38:29.105
saying He who dwells in the shelter

612
00:38:29.525 --> 00:38:33.385
of the most high will abide in the shadow

613
00:38:33.725 --> 00:38:34.745
of the Almighty.

614
00:38:35.045 --> 00:38:37.505
And I'll say to the Lord, my refuge

615
00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:42.465
and my fortress in God, in whom I

616
00:38:42.995 --> 00:38:43.345
trust.
