Hello, my name is Tim Brook, and this is my wife, Carrie.

2
00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:15.645
And last year we hosted three

3
00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:17.205
international students for Thanksgiving.

4
00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:19.405
We weren't really sure what to expect at first.

5
00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:21.685
Uh, three of the guys ended up coming.

6
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:24.165
Um, I was a little hesitant about culture

7
00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:28.405
and language barriers, but, um, that faded pretty quickly.

8
00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:31.125
When we started playing games, we watched football,

9
00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:33.645
we had conversations about their families.

10
00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:37.365
I wanted to know about their siblings, their parents, um,

11
00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:39.205
kind of what they do for fun.

12
00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:43.005
It was fun to share these new experiences

13
00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:44.125
with people for the first time.

14
00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:46.765
Uh, I'm a parent of two college kids

15
00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:48.805
that are away from our home, not too far,

16
00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:53.285
but enough away that, uh, when they're with other families

17
00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:56.565
or in other homes, I'm at peace with that

18
00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:59.565
because I know they get to experience something outside

19
00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:02.885
of their normal in this kind of environment and situation.

20
00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:05.445
We get to pay that forward with their kids who are miles

21
00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:06.685
and miles away from home.

22
00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:10.285
And we get to love on these kids who aren't near family.

23
00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:13.925
So that was really important to us to host these kids

24
00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.765
and to have them in our home and to share a meal together.

25
00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:20.005
What my encouragement for others would be

26
00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:24.525
is you really don't know what you're missing until you,

27
00:01:25.345 --> 00:01:27.405
uh, spend time with these internationals.

28
00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:30.525
And, uh, even though it may be intimidating, um,

29
00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:35.085
these are just human beings that, uh, are in most

30
00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:37.365
of the time, um, an environment

31
00:01:37.365 --> 00:01:40.205
that they've not been in much, uh, before in their life.

32
00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:43.605
So, um, they're probably scared or lonely.

33
00:01:44.265 --> 00:01:47.085
Um, and it's an opportunity that we have to share the love

34
00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:50.805
of Christ with them, um, and give them some peace

35
00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.485
and comfort, um,

36
00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.485
and a place that they are not used to being.

37
00:01:54.985 --> 00:01:58.405
Um, a couple of the boys that were with us, um,

38
00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.045
had only been there for a few months, um,

39
00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:02.805
in America for the first time.

40
00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:05.245
Um, and going to Christmas, um,

41
00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:08.325
gives us even more opportunities to weave, um,

42
00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:11.885
gospel conversations into the conversations we have

43
00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:13.445
with the internationals.

44
00:02:13.945 --> 00:02:17.725
If you are considering bringing in an international

45
00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:21.445
student for your holidays, I highly encourage you to do so.

46
00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:25.285
There is something incredibly special about saying yes

47
00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:26.965
to the Lord without knowing

48
00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:31.085
or, um, having an idea of

49
00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:32.365
what the other side of that will look like.

50
00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:37.285
But when we did that, it, it brought a whole new level

51
00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:40.165
of just how close God is to us in those moments,

52
00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:43.085
and how precious those times are when we open up our homes

53
00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:45.365
and ourselves to people that are not like us.

54
00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.365
You know, if you're considering it all,

55
00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:49.325
just go take the step.
