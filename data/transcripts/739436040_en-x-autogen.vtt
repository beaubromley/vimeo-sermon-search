1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.800
Who is

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.200
the god like Yahweh the god

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.100
of wrath the god of

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.500
Mercy The God Who reaches down to

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
unworthy people.

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.600
in the year that King Uzziah died

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.200
I saw the Lord.

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.400
sitting upon a throne

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.300
high and lifted up

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.300
and the train of his robe filled the temple.

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.000
Above him stood the seraphim.

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.000
each had six wings

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.400
with two he covered his face with two he covered

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.300
his feet with Chewy flu.

15
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.500
And one called to another and said

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.000
holy.

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.800
Holy.

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.700
Holy is the Lord of hosts.

19
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.500
The whole earth is full of his glory.

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.100
And the foundations of the thresholds shook.

21
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.400
At the voice of him who called.

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.900
The house was filled with smoke.

23
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.700
and I said

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.400
Whoa is me.

25
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.600
For I am lost.

26
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.700
For I'm a man of unclean lips.

27
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.400
And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.

28
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.500
For my eyes have seen the king.

29
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.900
the Lord of hosts

30
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.400
Can you imagine that scene?

31
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.400
Put yourself in Isaiah's shoes as he recorded these words in

32
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.100
chapter 6 of his prophecy.

33
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.200
Do you see the Lord Yahweh hi

34
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.500
and lift it up.

35
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.500
Can you hear the choirs of angels shouting holy?

36
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.700
about this one on the Mountaintop

37
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.000
But then in light of that do you feel what I

38
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.500
say a felt in verse 5?

39
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800
That because of God's holiness.

40
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.000
You have no right to stand in his

41
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.700
presence.

42
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.500
That you can never reach him.

43
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.700
That there is a huge Chasm of Valley

44
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.000
between you and him.

45
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.000
See that is the fundamental question that we are going to ask.

46
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.100
over the next couple months

47
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.400
with that image of a mountain fixed squarely in our minds.

48
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.600
the question

49
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.400
Who can ascend?

50
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.400
Who can ever Ascend to the mountain of a holy

51
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.000
God to be with him forever?

52
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.300
And if we could ever get there with him.

53
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.600
What does God then require?

54
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.900
of us

55
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.400
That's what we'll see in the Book of Micah.

56
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.900
in the Old Testament

57
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.100
And so if you're not already there take your copy of

58
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.100
God's word and turn with me to the Book of Micah.

59
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.500
Let me first acknowledge that we have some new

60
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.600
friends with us in here kindergartners. I love

61
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.200
the fact that you're in here with us now and we're excited to have

62
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.500
you follow along with us read along here Listen and

63
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.000
talk. We're excited for you and thankful for you.

64
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.000
But right now we're going to the book of Mike and I know all of

65
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.300
you have your Old Testament books memorized in order. So, you know exactly

66
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.300
where Micah is you spent your time in the profits this

67
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.100
week and you're quiet Tom. I know no just kidding like you need to use a

68
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.600
table of content. That's fine. I have to as well, but

69
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600
let me give you an easy way to find it.

70
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.300
Just open right to the middle. I mean, it's almost exactly in the middle of my

71
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.100
Bible and you can roughly find where it is

72
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.600
there and you'll you'll find that you find these these

73
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.700
profits in order and so you get Isaiah and Jeremiah Ezekiel

74
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.200
Daniel those are there but then you get to the little

75
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.700
ones called the minor not because they're unimportant because they're short you

76
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.600
get Hosea Joel Amos Obadiah Jonah

77
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.100
Micah. So that's where you'll find it there put

78
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.700
a bookmark there because we're gonna be in there for a couple months. You

79
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.400
don't have to worry about finding it next time.

80
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.000
But we'll be there pretty much till Thanksgiving.

81
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.200
But we're going to walk straight through this book called Micah.

82
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.900
And we're going to see how to study a book.

83
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.200
That honestly most of us are pretty unfamiliar with.

84
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.100
Frankly, I'm kind of intimidated by it. It's just it's gonna

85
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.200
be hard to walk through and you'll see why but that's why

86
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.300
I believe God led us to this this little book here.

87
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.500
Because just as much as any of the other 65 books

88
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.500
in the Bible, this one is God's word as well.

89
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.200
So we need to learn how to read it how to understand

90
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.400
it how to apply it. That's one reason, but

91
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.300
also there's another reason.

92
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.800
Because I believe it has a lot to say to a culture like ours.

93
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.600
See Micah was speaking to an historically

94
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.000
God-fearing Nation.

95
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.100
That had gotten pretty comfortable.

96
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.300
And then things started to go south as they drifted away from

97
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.600
God.

98
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.600
And rather than identifying the wrong reasons

99
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.100
for why that was happening in their lives. God got

100
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.300
to the heart of the issue through his

101
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.500
prophet Micah.

102
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.400
He shows them exactly what their problem

103
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.200
is what they're doing what they have on the other side of

104
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.500
this if they keep doing it and it's going to challenge us in many

105
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.400
of the same ways.

106
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.300
So we're going to do today is we're gonna get started by looking at the

107
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.100
context of the book context of

108
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.800
Micah basically just verse one of chapter one.

109
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.300
Really what we know about Micah what we know about his environment what was happening

110
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.700
at the time. We're gonna just see the context.

111
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.600
And then we're going to give a quick overview of the book as well.

112
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.600
Now. We are going to do a pretty deep dive

113
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.000
into the context here.

114
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.100
And so I know that some of you here that and your eyes

115
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.200
glaze over just don't work. There's there's no quiz on the way home. Like I'm not

116
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.700
gonna call you tonight. Ask you what this king's name was just breathe a

117
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.200
little bit. Okay, because I want you to I want

118
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.200
you just to kind of sit and enjoy getting pulled into the story.

119
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.100
That this was 2700 years or so

120
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.400
ago to get pulled into this and see what was happening

121
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.100
is so you have this framework in your head as we go through the rest of

122
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.400
the book to know why he's saying what he's saying because that's why

123
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.300
this is so critically important.

124
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.200
Like if you struggle with the history stuff, we're gonna get into the meat of

125
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.600
it next week. So please come back and you'll be able to walk through and to be more typical

126
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.800
of what we do. But but this is important for

127
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.000
us to understand because what it's going

128
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.200
to help us do is compare.

129
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.400
What is similar about what is happening in Micah's day?

130
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.300
To what's happening today, but also to show what's different

131
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.700
between what they're experiencing and

132
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.500
how that should be applied in versus today what

133
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.400
we experience.

134
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.200
So this is really important is it's hard as it

135
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.400
might be. I'm trying to make it engaging but but this is really important for us

136
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.600
to know as we go into the Book of Micah.

137
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.600
So look at verse 1 of chapter 1 Micah.

138
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.700
The word of the Lord that came to Micah

139
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.800
of morrisheth in the days of jotham ahaz

140
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.100
and has Hezekiah Kings of

141
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.500
Judah.

142
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.400
Which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

143
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.100
Now we need to notice a couple really important elements here.

144
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.500
First was he say initially. It was the word of the Lord

145
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.400
that came to Micah.

146
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.500
In other words, this is God's message to people.

147
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.100
This wasn't Micah coming up with something on his

148
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.300
own because he wanted to come down hard on a group of people that he didn't

149
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:08.500
like.

150
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.300
So he starts judging them. No, that was not it. No, this

151
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.400
was because God said everything that he writes down

152
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:15.600
here.

153
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.200
Same idea. We see in second Peter 1:21 that

154
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.800
the prophets spoke as God spoke through

155
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.100
them.

156
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.300
proving that they are prophets

157
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.600
Okay, so who was Micah?

158
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.100
We don't have a lot of background information on Micah. We

159
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.000
know his hometown here was more a chef, which is a small town Southwest

160
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.000
of Jerusalem.

161
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.700
But we don't know much about him as a person.

162
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.200
But really honestly, that's not that important compared to

163
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.200
his willingness to be a Divine mouthpiece.

164
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.800
To be the one that God uses to speak these words.

165
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.300
to the people

166
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.300
But we do know a couple things about them. We know he was a prophet because

167
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.100
not only is he saying this here, but he

168
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.100
also shows up elsewhere as a prophet like in Jeremiah 26

169
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.600
verse 18. He's talking to King Hezekiah who

170
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.800
showed up here in verse 1. There's a another way that he's shown

171
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.400
to be prophetic in his actions.

172
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.300
We know he was a prophet. We also know that he was courageous.

173
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.200
in this proclamation of judgment

174
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.500
By the way to a nation that might have been pretty shocked

175
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.700
by his words.

176
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.500
see what we're going to come to find out over the next couple weeks is

177
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:28.700
that

178
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.400
This entire structure of the economic political

179
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.500
and religious system in his nation

180
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.600
was corrupt.

181
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.600
It had gotten there over time. We'll talk through that a little bit.

182
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.200
But widows and immigrants and the poor were especially vulnerable in

183
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.300
this time frame and yet Micah knowing

184
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.500
that was the culture. He didn't nuanced his

185
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.200
words at all.

186
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.200
In fact, he called it out directly.

187
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.800
Even to a people who thought that

188
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.000
there was no way that God would judge them.

189
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.300
I mean these people were standing to say hey, we got the temple.

190
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.200
Like the presence of God is right here in our city.

191
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.900
There's no way God would judge us.

192
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.600
Like we're good. I mean we got the temple, right?

193
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.800
And Michael looks at him and says yeah, that's true.

194
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.100
But not if you turn away from God.

195
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.300
Not if you are full of Injustice in

196
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.200
your midst in your allowing it to go that that doesn't mean you

197
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.300
have God's presence.

198
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.400
Meaning a lack of repentance brings judgment

199
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.300
no matter who you are.

200
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.600
And so Micah was passionate about God's people reflecting

201
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.300
God's character. His priority is what he was about and he

202
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.500
saw it happen around him that it wasn't and so God used

203
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.400
him to call it out.

204
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.300
So that's a little bit about Micah. But what about these other three names? He mentions

205
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.000
here these Kings of Judah.

206
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.200
Along with he says Samaria and Jerusalem, which

207
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.500
are the locations to which he directed his prophecies.

208
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.100
Well, here's what we have to have a little bit of a history lesson. So if you

209
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.200
remember this as we walked back in time because all the

210
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.700
way back in the book of Exodus where it was God calling out

211
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.300
the 12 tribes of Israel of Jacob his

212
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:24.900
sons

213
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.400
out of slavery in Egypt

214
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.600
He freed them. It was incredible process miraculous, but

215
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.300
then they wandered about in the desert for about

216
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.400
40 years before entering into the

217
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.000
land that God had promised Abraham called Canaan,

218
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.800
which is what we know now. Today is Israel.

219
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.400
And so they wandered and in that process of as they're

220
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.400
about to come into the promised land Moses stands up in Deuteronomy,

221
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.400
27 and 28 and he warns them. He says

222
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.900
Hey guys. Listen, you're about to go in but there's going to be Temptations in

223
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.500
there that we're going to drift your heart away

224
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.900
from following this Covenant. God has done

225
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.200
with you.

226
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.200
That he's initiated his Covenant and he said here's what you need

227
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.300
to do. And I'm going to bless you. If you do it. I'm going to curse you.

228
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.100
If you don't he says guys there's gonna be stuff there that tempts you.

229
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.200
Be ready be ready and they say oh

230
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.000
we're good. We're in.

231
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.100
Well what we learned throughout Israel's story is that

232
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.700
there were cycles of sin and repentance sin and

233
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.400
repentance sin and repentance the Book of Judges remember

234
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.300
that a couple years ago, like just there was this cycle of

235
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.000
back and forth.

236
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.100
Until eventually what we learn about 1,000 BC thousand

237
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.100
years before Christ came.

238
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.200
Through a series of events. God raised

239
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.000
up David.

240
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.300
As his King for Jacob for Israel the

241
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:50.900
Twelve Tribes.

242
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.200
And then David's son Solomon was a king that followed him. And really

243
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.100
that was the high point of Israel's history.

244
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.200
Economically socially even religiously

245
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.100
because under Solomon the

246
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.400
temple was built. It was a tabernacle. It was a tent all around

247
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.200
the desert for so long and then God says no

248
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.000
in Jerusalem. I'm putting my my home my Dwelling

249
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.100
Place.

250
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.000
And they build the temple and it is the high point of Israel's history.

251
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.700
But you know if there's a high point then it there's lower

252
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.700
points from there, right?

253
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.400
And so because of Solomon's Rebellion against God and

254
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.100
his sin.

255
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.500
What we learn is that the once unified Kingdom.

256
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.500
High Point 12 tribes celebrating God

257
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.500
we're in the land all of that from that point forward there

258
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.300
was now a divided Kingdom.

259
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.600
And that once unified King splits into two the

260
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.200
North and the South going to put a picture up there. It's

261
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.300
really well done as you can see.

262
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.500
all about professionalism here

263
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.500
But every other map I could find had such tiny little

264
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.100
letters. There's no way you could see it from there. So this is what we got,

265
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.400
but it illustrates exactly what I just talked about that

266
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.400
this once unified Kingdom split into two and

267
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.200
so you see on the North kingdom is the word Israel now

268
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.100
you think but that's Israel from the past, right? That's all

269
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.800
together. Actually. They took the name Israel.

270
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.800
And an allowed as they rejected the authority of Jerusalem and

271
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.500
what God really wanted to do. They became the northern kingdom

272
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.400
and they took the name Israel, and they had the capital

273
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.600
of Samaria.

274
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.300
Now that might be familiar to some of us who know the New Testament

275
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.200
that there was a city that Jesus referred to

276
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.600
regulated visited that Samaria, right and Samaritans. That's

277
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.100
where this all came from this northern kingdom that

278
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.300
broke away said we're we're we don't want your Authority.

279
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.100
Well, the other two tribes that was about 10 of the

280
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.700
tribes did that the other two tribes remained and kept Jerusalem

281
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.500
as their capital and that was the southern Kingdom collectively known

282
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.800
as Judah.

283
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.500
And so you have Israel and Judah and the

284
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.300
Judah line was still going to be David's line. That was where they

285
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.700
the northern King rejected that they didn't want anything to do with David's line

286
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.500
anymore. But Judah kept it as as secure.

287
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.300
By the way, if you want to read all this you can go back and read Samuel Kings and

288
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.400
Chronicles first and second of each of those. It's the whole narrative

289
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.300
right there of all the locations and Kings and the drama like

290
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.100
you think Netflix is good. Go read that

291
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.300
stuff, right? There's a lot there.

292
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.100
But that's where we are now.

293
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.800
So we're at this divided Kingdom once Solomon messed it

294
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.000
all up then then this divided Kingdom happens.

295
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.600
And so then he mentions and Micah 1:1 there's three kings and

296
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.500
all of those kings were in the southern Kingdom the northern

297
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.000
kingdom kind of shot off and did their own thing the southern

298
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.300
kingdoms were Micah was primarily based and these

299
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.600
three kings were Kings in Jerusalem of Judah.

300
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.000
micropside under all three of those

301
00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.400
So we need to know who they are, right because this is showing us time and

302
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.700
context who were they first. He says jotham.

303
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.500
Jotham's Dad was Uzziah. Who was the king of

304
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.400
Judah as well?

305
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.200
Now that name Uzi should sound familiar if you were here at the

306
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.300
start where I was reading from Isaiah 6 it was

307
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.600
because Uzziah died that Isaiah saw

308
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.100
this vision of God Uzziah was one of the greatest

309
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.200
Kings in history of Israel of Judah.

310
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.500
and he was a great king for so long had a lot of prosperity and the

311
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.500
kingdom was doing well and then all of a sudden he dies

312
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:31.700
and

313
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.300
the Nations thrown for a loop. People are like Where's God now?

314
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.100
What are we going to do? How are we going to survive? This man was

315
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.700
our connection in some way.

316
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.100
Well jotham comes to power as the king and he was able to

317
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.400
do. Okay, he kind of held it together enough for a

318
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.100
while. But then what they started to recognize that there was a

319
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.700
threat from the outside coming in.

320
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.400
And there's this nation called Assyria out

321
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.200
to the Northeast.

322
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.300
And they were starting to press closer to

323
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.200
Israel and Judah.

324
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.100
Well jotham dies and a has.

325
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.700
Became the king.

326
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.000
And ahaz took the nation from somewhat

327
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.800
together yet.

328
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.600
far from God

329
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.000
a has trusted political alliances more

330
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.600
than he feared God. He feared people more

331
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.900
than he feared God. He was wicked.

332
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.500
and instead

333
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.800
of helping his Northern Israelite brothers

334
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.000
against that threat from Assyria.

335
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.400
He actually chose instead to partner with

336
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.600
a Syria to protect him and his Nation from

337
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.300
his Israelite brothers in the North.

338
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.400
Instead of these people who came from the same line of Jacob. He

339
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.200
said no, I'm working with the Assyrians and what

340
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.600
that led to is they kind of combined and Israel fell to

341
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.000
Assyria in about 722 BC.

342
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.500
the northern kingdom exiled gone

343
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.100
Just as prophets had predicted by the way.

344
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.200
And so a has is kind of in League with the syrians now

345
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.300
and all the sudden he's thinking well, this is pretty good. They helped me win.

346
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.500
They helped me protected and so he adopts a Syrian

347
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.000
worship.

348
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.800
Even replacing in that Temple the altar

349
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.300
of God with an altar to an unknown God.

350
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.500
As second Corinthians 16 and go read that.

351
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.300
Here's what that's like if we would replace that cross out there with a picture

352
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.000
of Buddha.

353
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:39.900
you're like

354
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.200
No, that's what happened here. That was the same kind of

355
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.500
idea.

356
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.600
And that idolatry flowed throughout the land even to

357
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.200
the point. So imagine the people of

358
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.000
God just a couple hundred years later got to the

359
00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.400
point where child sacrifice was a part of worship.

360
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.100
That's how far you see how far someone who

361
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.600
doesn't fear. God can actually go.

362
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.400
That's what we see a has do.

363
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.300
So Micah's prophesying under jotham, and then

364
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.300
he's prophesying under ahaz. And now there's a third name. His name

365
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.600
is Hezekiah that he prophesies under as the king. That's a

366
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.700
has his son.

367
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.000
And Hezekiah continued on the same practices in

368
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.200
many ways oppression of the poor false worship

369
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:28.900
all those things.

370
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.600
But here's the difference.

371
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.300
as the Assyrian army started creeping closer

372
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.700
They just taken the North and now they're still like well, let's

373
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.800
just take the South too. So they're creeping down. They're coming towards

374
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.000
Judah. This is about 701 BC as

375
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.600
he's feeling the pressure.

376
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.300
finally

377
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.400
one of Micah's messages got through

378
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.900
to him.

379
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.800
And King Hezekiah all the sudden finally recognizes.

380
00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.600
No, we need God.

381
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.400
So he leads a time of repentant prayer in response to that prediction

382
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.000
of Destruction. He says God we need you and he gets on

383
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.400
his face. They get on their faces and God relented. He turned

384
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.700
the Assyrian army away.

385
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.400
And thankfully it led Judah to survive for about another hundred years after

386
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:18.700
that.

387
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.300
Before they eventually fell to a different Nation called

388
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.000
Babylon.

389
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.000
They had drifted back into many of the

390
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.800
same practices. They'd gone down the same roads. And God said, okay.

391
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.600
Babylon comes destroys

392
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.300
the southern Kingdom and Exiles them

393
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.600
and it was all confirmation of Micah and other prophets

394
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.500
prophecies throughout the whole of those couple

395
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.200
hundred years. They kept saying it's coming it's coming if

396
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:45.900
you don't repent it's coming.

397
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.000
And God did it.

398
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.200
So when you think about the context that's what we find ourselves in.

399
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.600
That's that's helpful for us to now frame everything else around

400
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.100
as we're seeing Micah say what he says over the

401
00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.300
next couple of weeks and months. Like how is he saying is why is

402
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.200
he saying this? Who's he talking to that's what we're saying. I know

403
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.200
things like that are tedious, but you see how important that is.

404
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.600
That we can't just overlay our context onto

405
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.400
Micah and apply it all 100% We have

406
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.800
to understand what they were going through to help us compare and

407
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.500
contrast how we then apply it.

408
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.000
So it's important.

409
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.900
But here's what I want to do with the rest of our time together this morning.

410
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.900
We have the context now.

411
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.300
I want to give you a brief overview of where we're going.

412
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.400
Without giving all of it away like I'm gonna give you

413
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.800
a hint of where we're going, but but I want you to hear.

414
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.200
With that context what Micah will

415
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.400
teach us and what it's going to challenge us with.

416
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.400
And I think there are three main questions that Micah really

417
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.900
implies.

418
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.300
Sometimes explicitly ask there's three main questions that it asks and

419
00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.600
answers along the way what's God wanting to get us to

420
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.300
see? What's he wanting to get them to see but also

421
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.700
what you want to get us to see here.

422
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.400
To understand from the book of micahs. We look at God's word.

423
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.500
Here's the first question.

424
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.000
Who is like Yahweh?

425
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.100
We look at this book.

426
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.200
Over the next couple months. We'll look at this book in depth and

427
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.700
what we'll see first is this question asked who is like

428
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.800
Yahweh.

429
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.900
Remember how I started this this message?

430
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.400
the picture of God in Isaiah chapter 6

431
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.200
We actually get a very similar picture in Micah

432
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.200
as I'm going to talk about this next week

433
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.200
a lot more but look at verses 2 through 4 a little preview of Coming

434
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.800
Attractions. It says here you people's all of you everybody listen

435
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.200
up pay attention to Earth all it is

436
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.000
in it and let the Lord God be a witness against you the

437
00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.100
Lord from his holy Temple. That sounds

438
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.700
like Isaiah saw God in the temple, right?

439
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.400
For behold the Lord is coming out of his place and it'll

440
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.500
come down and tread upon the high places the Earth. The mountains will

441
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.300
melt before him and The Valleys will split open like

442
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.300
Wax before the fire like water is poured down a steep

443
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:14.600
place.

444
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.000
Basically, he's saying there is no God like Yahweh.

445
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.600
But here's even the better way that we know this question is asked

446
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600
in Micah.

447
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.700
It actually goes back to the very meaning of Micah's name.

448
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.200
So, you know names have meanings and and can point us to something

449
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.200
especially biblically. We can see a lot in the names.

450
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.000
But the name Micah.

451
00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.600
Means who is like Yahweh.

452
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.200
Like so his very name who is like Yahweh that

453
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.200
question just follows him around his entire life.

454
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.100
Everybody knows when you see Micah that

455
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.400
his the fundamental question of life is who is like

456
00:23:59.400 --> 00:23:59.900
Yahweh.

457
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.500
And as a prophet, he's standing up saying these messages to people and

458
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.100
he's basically asking them by his presence who's like

459
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.400
yelling.

460
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.100
Who is like our God?

461
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.100
In fact, he cleverly ends the book. He starts it

462
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.600
with his own name who is like Yahweh incident seven Eighteen with

463
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.200
the same question. Who's a God Like You

464
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.200
I talked about God's character in that who is who is

465
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.300
like Yahweh. Who is a God Like You So this entire book examines

466
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.600
whether any God or any Idol

467
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.600
can compare can stand against this holy

468
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:34.800
God.

469
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.200
Can stand against Yahweh can stand against the Lord of all creation.

470
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.200
It's an examination of all of the competitors.

471
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.100
Spoiler alert, there is not one, right?

472
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.200
That's the point of this who is like y'all. It's a

473
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.000
rhetorical question meant to get you to think to say.

474
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:54.600
No one.

475
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.600
No one who is like Yahweh. There is none worthy

476
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.800
of our worship, but him.

477
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.400
He's holy.

478
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.900
When we say that word, holy we mean he's set apart. He's different.

479
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.300
He's out there different set apart from

480
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.600
us. Holy completely other he's not

481
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.500
tainted not it constrained. He's out

482
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.000
there.

483
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.500
Which means as holy he has every right as the Creator

484
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.800
to Demand right living from those he created and to judge

485
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.600
those who don't live according to that standard.

486
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.500
That's Holiness according to God.

487
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.400
Which leads us into a second question in Micah?

488
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.500
Who is like Yahweh. Well, then who can Ascend to Yahweh.

489
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.300
We see that very clearly who is like Yahweh, but then who can Ascend

490
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.300
to him if if that's who he is. How can

491
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.700
we ever get there?

492
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.500
Because there's this theme this this image of a mountain

493
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.000
throughout God's word that mountain as a place where God

494
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
dwells.

495
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.400
It illustrates Holiness, it illustrates separation and power and

496
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.400
sovereignty. That's God's up there. We're down here

497
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.300
and you see it all over.

498
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.400
Like in Mount Sinai when Moses meets with God he

499
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.200
goes up the mountain to meet with God and everybody else. You remember

500
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.200
the story. Everybody else is like scared because they know God's up there

501
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.100
and they're gonna do they're gonna get killed or they're gonna get

502
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.100
run off. They don't know they're scared like Moses you go for us.

503
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.200
We'll stay down here you go up. There you go talk to go because

504
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.000
we don't want to do anything with it.

505
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.400
It was just because

506
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.400
we find it in Jerusalem. Even where on this

507
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.400
mountain that God had met repeatedly with his people.

508
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.400
He commanded his Temple to be built in

509
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:43.900
that very spot.

510
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.600
So that's where I've met with you over and over again. That's where I'm going to be dwelling in

511
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.200
my place. And the way the scripture talks about is

512
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.900
a word called Zion.

513
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.000
Mount Zion

514
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.100
Throughout God's word. We see that theme show up

515
00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.300
and what it points us to is that's God's dwelling place, but it's

516
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.900
also our eventual home.

517
00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.700
That we're going to be with God that's going to be where we are with

518
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.400
him. It's also the place that Jesus Will Stand one day

519
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.400
as the king Revelation 14:1, right? So that's that's

520
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.400
all part of this that Mount Zion is like this encompassing location

521
00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.500
that says here's where God

522
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:21.700
is

523
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.700
and it's a mountain.

524
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.700
Micah 4:1 happens to call it the highest of mountains

525
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.600
And says many nations will come to that mountain

526
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.500
that will come to that Yahweh. But

527
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.000
that again reminds us the same question. We're still

528
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.000
asking Psalm 24:3 says who shall Ascend

529
00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.700
the hill of the Lord.

530
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.100
Okay, he's on the mountain. That's where he is. He's holy we're scared of that

531
00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.500
who's gonna get there?

532
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.700
Who will stand in his holy place?

533
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.600
And Micah doesn't shy away from telling us about the darkness

534
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.400
of judgment for those that are not.

535
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.800
in God's presence

536
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.500
He consistently repeats the darkness of judgment that there

537
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.200
is a God out there. That is a god of judgment, but we

538
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.600
we're down here.

539
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.100
Israel and Judah turn their backs on God they got judgment

540
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.600
for that.

541
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.600
God expected them to be as representatives to the nation. He

542
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.900
had to correct them when they weren't.

543
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.400
That's what first Peter 4:17 says that judgment begins

544
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.400
at the household of God. He cares about how we live

545
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.300
as his people.

546
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.300
So when they worshiped false gods

547
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.200
when they when they committed Injustice is along the way they didn't

548
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.300
care for immigrants. They spoke evil of one another and so

549
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.300
on and so forth God chose to discipline them

550
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.200
to bring them back but in so doing

551
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.400
he revealed that many of them didn't actually trust him in

552
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:53.600
the first place.

553
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.600
They were leaning on their family line their lineage the

554
00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:58.900
same we're good.

555
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.700
My dad's Abraham, I'm good.

556
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.700
But they didn't have faith.

557
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.200
Trust

558
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.300
in this Yahweh.

559
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.100
See, that's the consistent drum beat even through.

560
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.500
the darkness

561
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.500
is that we all are due his judgment.

562
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.800
Micah is a heavy book.

563
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.800
It shows God's response to sin. It shows his the

564
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.600
cycles of idolatry and judgment idolatry and

565
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.900
judgment and it's dark.

566
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.200
but at the same time

567
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.100
even in this bad news cycle that we're going

568
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.400
to get over and over.

569
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.700
There's a glimmer of good news here.

570
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.400
Throughout this same book that Micah not only shows the darkness

571
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.100
of judgment. He also shines the light of

572
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.000
Mercy in the same book.

573
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.700
It's not all doom and gloom. It's it's actually hints unglimmers

574
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.200
of Mercy throughout that

575
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.000
we need to see.

576
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.200
That yes, we should walk away with a renewed sense

577
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.300
of Holiness and Justice of God. He's going to judge Sinners on

578
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.200
the earth. We should not ever forget that or move past that too quickly,

579
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.300
but he will also show us that he's

580
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.900
a God who is forgiving compassionate.

581
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.000
merciful

582
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.100
at the same time

583
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.300
see God's Not Like Us.

584
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.500
God can be a god of judgment and mercy at

585
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:33.900
the same time.

586
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.500
Kind of blows our minds but it's true that he will not go back on his promises

587
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.400
to Abraham and to Moses that he's gonna bring a nation

588
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.500
of faith that he's merciful. He's gracious slow to

589
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.200
anger abounding instead fast, love and faithfulness to his

590
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.300
people. That's who he is as well as a god of

591
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:50.500
judgment.

592
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.500
All throughout this Book of Micah even through

593
00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.300
the darkness of judgment. We

594
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.900
see this one word show up. It's a Hebrew word. It's Hess

595
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.100
said you got to get it in your throat. Right past said you

596
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.000
got to say it that way. It's Mercy.

597
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:14.100
It's the word for Mercy For Loving kindness for steadfast

598
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.900
love that. This is God's love for

599
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.400
his people.

600
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.200
We see it all here. It's Micah 7 the end of

601
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.700
it. He says who is a God Like You.

602
00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:30.100
We've asked the question who is like Yahweh pardoning iniquity.

603
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.100
God forgives passing over transgression for

604
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.700
the remnant of his inheritance. We'll see who the remnant is. He does

605
00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.400
not retain his anger forever. He Delights in steadfast

606
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.400
love. There it is.

607
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.500
He again have compassion on us. He'll tread our iniquities Under

608
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.600
Foot you'll cast all our sins into the depths

609
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.400
of the sea.

610
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.200
You'll show faithfulness to Jacob. Remember Jacob is before the

611
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.500
split Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham as

612
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.500
you've sworn to our fathers from the days of old. This is

613
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.200
who God is

614
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.200
Mike at the end of all of the judgment and Declarations

615
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.200
of Destruction. He looks up and says

616
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.400
God you are a god of Mercy.

617
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.700
It's the same thing that Isaiah saw.

618
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.400
Experienced remember at the beginning of the sermon he he saw

619
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.200
the vision of God and His holy Temple. And what

620
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.500
was he in response? He was broken.

621
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.400
Woe is me. I am broken. I am done. I am

622
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.100
among a people. There's no hope for me.

623
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.100
Is how it continues?

624
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.300
Isaiah 6 verse 6 then one of the seraphim flew to

625
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.200
me having in his hand a burning coal. He had taken with

626
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.700
tongs from The Altar and he touched my mouth remember his

627
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.300
unclean lips is what he was talking about. That's my problem

628
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.000
and he touched his lips.

629
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.900
With the coal and he said this behold this

630
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.500
has touched your lips. Your guilt is taken

631
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.500
away and your sin atoned for

632
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.200
Here's what Isaiah experience. Here's what Micah teaches us.

633
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.100
Here's what we need to remember is that yes.

634
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.600
God is a god of judgment, but he at the

635
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.900
same time will bring Salvation.

636
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.400
Mark it's hard. But he's going to bring Salvation and

637
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.600
he's not going to do it just by some kind of like I'm gonna turn the

638
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.600
other way and look look Beyond it. No, he does

639
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.000
it in a way that goes exactly opposite

640
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.500
of what the people had failed at.

641
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.200
So remember the kings were Wicked and they got them in

642
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.700
trouble and they got them divided and they got them all the way around and yet

643
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.700
Micah in Micah

644
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.000
5.

645
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.100
He says here's how God says here's how I'm going

646
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:47.600
to save you.

647
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.400
I'm going to send a king to be born in a place

648
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.500
that you don't think kings are born from called Bethlehem.

649
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.000
And I'm going to send a king who's going to be your Shepherd. Who's Gonna Be

650
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.400
Your Leader? Who's going to bring you together as you were

651
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:01.600
separated?

652
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.500
See, he's going to bring a righteous King from the

653
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.700
line of David because remember David's from Bethlehem.

654
00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.000
That's where David's family's from.

655
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.400
The line of Judah the king it's this is gonna fulfill

656
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.600
the promise Micah 5.

657
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.400
I'm gonna bring a righteous King through the line of David to

658
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.800
save you my people.

659
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.200
In contrast to all the fickle Kings the wicked kings

660
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.300
that you once followed. Got you in trouble. I'm gonna bring a king

661
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.300
that's going to be merciful. I'm gonna bring a savior king

662
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.200
that's gonna be right.

663
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.100
Here's the beautiful part of this.

664
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.300
For them back then it was a future hope.

665
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.300
This was 700 years before Jesus came. So all they're doing

666
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.200
is they're looking forward to this Messiah savior to come and they're saying

667
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.200
okay God we believe you.

668
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.100
We hope it comes now, but we believe you it's going to come.

669
00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.400
What was future for them is now past present

670
00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.300
and future for us.

671
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.800
It's what we see that that in part

672
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.200
Micah prophesied about this Micah 5

673
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.500
Shepherd King in part. We have seen that Jesus is

674
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.600
that King born in Bethlehem who came to carry

675
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.000
the Judgment of that sin on himself on the

676
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.400
cross that he is the one who brings us

677
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.400
up the Holy Mountain.

678
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.300
By his own blood shed for us

679
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.700
in his life death and Resurrection in our place. He brings us to

680
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.200
him his blood covers Us.

681
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.200
That we now have hope because of it.

682
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.800
We sing about hope all already today.

683
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.100
Hope is not just wishful thinking hope is based on

684
00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.200
something solid.

685
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.700
Even if we can't see it yet.

686
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:50.000
They were hoping in the Savior King. We know who

687
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.400
that is, and we hope in him as well.

688
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.500
I love how Ephesians chapter 2 illustrates what

689
00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.700
my teacher teaches in his book.

690
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.300
This is the New Testament. This is post Jesus. We know the truth

691
00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.000
of it, but listen to how similar the ideas are.

692
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.300
Even in the New Testament of what God has done to save us.

693
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.300
Ephesians chapter 2 you were dead.

694
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.700
In the trespasses and sins in which you once walked

695
00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.400
following the course of this world following the

696
00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.300
prince of the power of the air the spirit that is now at

697
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.500
work in the sons of Disobedience among whom we all once lived

698
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.900
in the passions of our flesh.

699
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.400
carrying out the desires of the body and the mind or by

700
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.900
Nature children of Wrath

701
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.800
Like the rest of mankind does that not sound like Micah's situation?

702
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.400
Everybody's doing whatever they want. Everything's running away from God

703
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.200
and they're dead because of it.

704
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.100
Verse 4 has the two greatest words and all of scripture.

705
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:52.400
but God

706
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:54.900
That's the problem.

707
00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.500
But God being rich in.

708
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:00.800
Mercy

709
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.600
Has said loving-kindness steadfast love

710
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.200
being rich in Mercy because of the

711
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.400
great love with which he loved us. Meaning. That's the start is God's love

712
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.600
not our love for him his love for us that love

713
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.900
that he loved us, even when we were dead in that trespass

714
00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.800
made us alive together with Christ

715
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.300
by Grace you have been saved and check

716
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.000
this out and raised us up with him and

717
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.300
seated us with him in the Heavenly places in Christ.

718
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.200
Jesus up the mountain remember, right? That's where

719
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.300
we're at with this so that in the coming ages. He

720
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.600
might show the immeasurable Riches of his grace in kindness

721
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.600
toward us in Christ Jesus.

722
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.300
You're in my faith in the mountain. That's right verse

723
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.100
8 by Grace. You've been saved through faith. This is not your

724
00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.000
own doing. It's a gift of God not a result of

725
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.300
works. So that no one may boast. You can't climb that mountain yourself.

726
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.100
But God by his grace.

727
00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.600
Even in your dead spiritual State.

728
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.100
He said come on.

729
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.400
And he made you alive together any made you whole he

730
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.400
made you present with him together. Praise

731
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:08.900
God, right?

732
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.700
I mean like in his love what he's done great love

733
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:14.500
that he's loved us.

734
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.600
In a moment, we're going to sing one of my favorite songs in the world. It's called Living Hope by

735
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.300
Phil Wickham.

736
00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.500
And I want you to just listen to the lyrics to this.

737
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.200
It beautifully portrays what we're talking about here is what

738
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.800
it says how it starts how great the chasm that

739
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.700
lay between us.

740
00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.900
How high the mountain I could not climb?

741
00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.900
in desperation

742
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.500
I turned to heaven and spoke your

743
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.200
name into the night.

744
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.600
Then through the darkness.

745
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.400
Your loving kindness that's that has said

746
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.300
that Mercy right tore through the shadows of

747
00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.300
my soul the darkness. The work is finished. The

748
00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.700
end is written Jesus Christ my Living Hope

749
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.500
Who could imagine so great a mercy?

750
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.200
What heart could fathom such boundless Grace the

751
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.700
god of Ages stepped down from

752
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.600
glory to where my sin and bear my

753
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.000
shame.

754
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.800
The cross has spoken. I am forgiven. The

755
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.800
King of Kings calls me his own.

756
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.200
Beautiful savior. I'm yours forever.

757
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.800
Jesus Christ my Living Hope.

758
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.100
Man, I'm gonna sing that song differently now, right?

759
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.800
Triumphing over judgment. That's what Jesus did

760
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.300
we see glimmers of it in Micah. We see

761
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.900
it in full in Jesus Christ.

762
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.400
And that Mercy is what then leads us.

763
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.600
It gives us every reason to turn away from sin turn

764
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.500
away from Idols turn away from sin that

765
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.700
brings judgment on us and turn to Jesus

766
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.200
in his work in our place.

767
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.200
Unbeliever, why are you waiting to do that? You see it, right? You

768
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.500
see that judgment is coming for you turn to Jesus today. That's

769
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.000
the only way

770
00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.600
But believer listen, this is also for you.

771
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.000
Why do you wait for God's discipline?

772
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.300
Before you go ahead and do what you know, you ought to do already.

773
00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.000
Before you give that habit up or before you love that neighbor.

774
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.700
Why wait for God's discipline? Why don't you just go ahead and do it now?

775
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.000
Avoid the pain, you know the right thing to do

776
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:33.900
do it.

777
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.600
because of his Mercy

778
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.100
See, that's actually the third question here.

779
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.500
Because we know that there's no God like Yahweh.

780
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.500
And we know that it's only by his grace that we're invited up

781
00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.500
the mountain to begin with.

782
00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:59.000
The third implied question here. Is that will we live for Yahweh

783
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.200
then?

784
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.800
Micah will ask that question.

785
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.900
How are we living for him?

786
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.600
for God

787
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.300
that's part of the deal here. That's part of the kingdom of God.

788
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.600
We're Representatives. We're ambassadors. In fact, that's what Micah does

789
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.400
so well in Micah 6 verse 8, that's a familiar verse to

790
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.900
so many people. He says this is how you're supposed to live.

791
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.400
God's commanded this he's required this of you. This is

792
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.900
what it says. He's told you. Oh man. What is good? What

793
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.600
does the Lord require of you

794
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.100
talking to his Covenant people the people supposed to be

795
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.400
as Representatives the ones who are supposed to live like him. He says,

796
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.600
what is the Lord require of you?

797
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.700
but to do justice

798
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.100
and to love kindness

799
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:47.800
has said

800
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.700
and to walk humbly with your God.

801
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.900
Boils it down. I don't know about you, but I like simplicity.

802
00:41:59.200 --> 00:41:59.700
That's pretty simple.

803
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:01.700
It's not easy.

804
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:03.900
But it's pretty simple.

805
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.300
That if she always has saved you through Jesus Christ

806
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.300
if that's where you say Jesus is my Lord

807
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.700
and Savior if that's you then your gratitude for

808
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.300
that salvation should lead you to a whole

809
00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.000
new life.

810
00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.500
Toward a pursuit of Holiness to be holy like

811
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.100
God is separated to not be caught up in all

812
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.200
the junk and the world and the way things are here. Like we

813
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.000
saw in Ephesians 2 we see in Micah don't be caught up in all that.

814
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.600
I'm holy. I'm set apart. I'm distinct.

815
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:38.600
like God is

816
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.500
Not for my glory, but for his glory if he saved me

817
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.700
then that gratitude should lead to that where I

818
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.600
am doing, right according to God's standard where I

819
00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.100
am. I'm loving others with that has said

820
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.500
Mercy that God's love me with

821
00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.400
And I'm walking humbly with my God.

822
00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.400
That's including like Isaiah responded to this forgiveness.

823
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.000
He says.

824
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.900
Wherever you send me God I'm in.

825
00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.100
Includes going on Mission includes what Ephesians 2:10 says

826
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.900
that there's good works God prepared in advance for you to do there's actions

827
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.500
you need to take there's things he's assigned for

828
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.900
you like we talked about last week There's assignments for you.

829
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.200
And you say to him I'm walking humbly with you God that means in on your

830
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.600
mission wherever you're taking me. I'm going

831
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:29.400
this

832
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.200
this is who he is who is like Yahweh.

833
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:34.700
No one.

834
00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.600
Who can Ascend to him on his Holy

835
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.000
Hill?

836
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.200
Only those who are invited in and cleansed by

837
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:45.500
him.

838
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.400
But will we then live for him?

839
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.800
only by his grace

840
00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.900
And only as we trust in his power to

841
00:43:58.900 --> 00:43:59.700
live it out through us.

842
00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.700
This Is Our God
