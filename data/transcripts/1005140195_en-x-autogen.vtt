00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:20.745
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:25.065
Welcome to Henderson Hills. So great to see all of you here.

3
00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:26.665
My name is Ryan Whitaker

4
00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:29.505
and it's a joy to serve as one of your elders here.

5
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.705
My family has been here for over 15 years

6
00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:36.425
and we know this is a great place for you to belong.

7
00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:39.785
So great to see your smiling faces.

8
00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:43.825
Now that being said, today's sermon is going

9
00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:45.905
to make you angry.

10
00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:49.945
At least I hope it does.

11
00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:55.585
And that was a harsh contrast. I know.

12
00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:58.145
But stay with me here. That's important.

13
00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:02.545
Now let's pray and seek God's guidance for us.

14
00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:04.665
Before we dig into the text this morning,

15
00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:05.785
let's bow our heads.

16
00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:10.665
Father, you are holy. Let it be.

17
00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:14.145
Let it not be said of us that we honor you with our lips,

18
00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:15.705
but our hearts are far from you.

19
00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:21.905
Instead, us instead as we open your word today, help us

20
00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:25.945
to see the seriousness of worshiping you rightly

21
00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:31.155
teach us through the contrast between Eli's sons

22
00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:32.435
and Samuel.

23
00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:35.595
It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.

24
00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:39.515
So if you have your Bibles, turn with me

25
00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:43.875
to one Samuel chapter two verses 11 through 26.

26
00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:46.355
Again, one Samuel two 11 through 26.

27
00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:51.075
So this month we have started a new sermon series over one

28
00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:53.795
Samuel and it's called He Shall Reign.

29
00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:57.835
And in this time we're still before the days of kingship.

30
00:01:57.895 --> 00:02:01.275
And the main character so far has been Hannah.

31
00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:06.275
And she is a faithful woman who was unable to have children.

32
00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:09.755
And so she cries out to the Lord, Lord, give me a child

33
00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.075
and I will give him back to you.

34
00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:16.255
And the Lord blesses her and gives her a child.

35
00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:21.575
And she names the child Samuel, which means asked of God

36
00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.255
or heard by God

37
00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:27.335
because the Lord hears her prayer.

38
00:02:28.395 --> 00:02:30.535
And so now Hannah is about

39
00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:35.015
to leave her son Samuel at the tabernacle under the care of

40
00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:36.735
Eli, the high priest.

41
00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:40.935
And last week we saw that uh, John showed us that

42
00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:44.215
before she leaves Samuel Hannah praise a prayer

43
00:02:44.475 --> 00:02:49.095
and she sings a song of praise to our God saying,

44
00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.255
my heart exalts in the Lord.

45
00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:56.705
And in a bit of foreshadowing in verse seven

46
00:02:56.885 --> 00:03:00.405
of this chapter, it says, he brings low

47
00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:02.725
and he exalts.

48
00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:05.845
In fact, that's what I want us to see this morning.

49
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:09.365
This harsh contrast between those.

50
00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:11.845
He brings low and those he exalts,

51
00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:16.345
he brings low and he exalts.

52
00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:20.825
In today's passage we see God in his uncompromising,

53
00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:24.745
holiness condemn corrupt leaders

54
00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:29.745
and these, these corrupt leaders, they stand in such harsh

55
00:03:30.385 --> 00:03:32.545
contrast to righteous leaders.

56
00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:36.785
And praise God, God raises up righteous leaders even in the

57
00:03:36.785 --> 00:03:39.705
midst of unflinching evil.

58
00:03:42.165 --> 00:03:46.905
You know, in in tough situations when things seem lifeless,

59
00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:52.265
we listen desperately for the beat of a heart.

60
00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:58.465
And when we hear it, the heartbeat stands in such contrast

61
00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.105
to the silence that surrounds it.

62
00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:06.165
You know today's passage, it dwells on the sins

63
00:04:06.165 --> 00:04:07.205
of Eli's sons.

64
00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.285
And in it we wonder, where is God in this?

65
00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:12.085
Where is he silent?

66
00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:18.065
But we find God's heartbeat that punctuates

67
00:04:18.605 --> 00:04:22.945
the silence and that heartbeat is Samuel.

68
00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:28.215
So let's all stand if you're able

69
00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:32.615
as we read God's word together one Samuel two 11 through 26.

70
00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:35.295
And listen for the contrasts here.

71
00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.735
Listen for God's heartbeat.

72
00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:41.735
Then Oana went home to Rama

73
00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:44.695
and the boy was ministering to the Lord in the presence

74
00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:46.015
of Eli, the priest.

75
00:04:46.675 --> 00:04:49.135
And now the sons of Eli were worthless men,

76
00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:50.975
they did not know the Lord.

77
00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:55.695
And the custom of the priests with the people was

78
00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:58.095
that when any man offered sacrifice,

79
00:04:58.555 --> 00:05:01.215
the priests servant would come while the meat was boiling

80
00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:02.935
with a three-pronged fork in his hand.

81
00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:06.175
And he would thrust it into the pan or pedal or a kettle

82
00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:07.215
or cauldron in a pot

83
00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:09.535
and all that the fork brought up the priest

84
00:05:09.535 --> 00:05:10.615
would take for himself.

85
00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:13.695
And this is what they did to did at Shiloh,

86
00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:15.655
to all the Israelites who came there.

87
00:05:16.295 --> 00:05:17.935
Moreover, before the fat was burned,

88
00:05:17.935 --> 00:05:19.015
the priest servant would come

89
00:05:19.015 --> 00:05:21.655
and say to the man who is sacrificing, give meat

90
00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:24.735
for the priest to roast for he'll not accept boiled meat

91
00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:26.015
from you but only raw.

92
00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:29.975
And if the man said to him, let let them burn the fat first

93
00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:32.335
and then take as much as you wish, he would say, no,

94
00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:33.895
you must give it now.

95
00:05:33.915 --> 00:05:36.215
And if not, I will take it by force.

96
00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:40.095
Thus, the sin of the young men was very great

97
00:05:40.115 --> 00:05:41.175
in the sight of the Lord.

98
00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:43.895
For the men treated the offering of the Lord with contempt.

99
00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:46.495
Samuel was ministering before the Lord.

100
00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:48.615
A boy clothed with a linen eod

101
00:05:48.835 --> 00:05:50.815
and his mother used to make for him a little robe

102
00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:52.735
and take it to him each year.

103
00:05:52.765 --> 00:05:53.895
When she went up with her husband

104
00:05:53.955 --> 00:05:55.495
to offer the yearly sacrifice,

105
00:05:56.405 --> 00:05:59.285
then Eli would would bless Elana and his wife

106
00:05:59.305 --> 00:06:02.005
and say, may the Lord give you children by this woman

107
00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:04.085
for the petition she asked of the Lord.

108
00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:07.005
So then they would return to their home.

109
00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:10.005
Indeed the Lord visited H and she conceived

110
00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:12.165
and bore three sons and two daughters.

111
00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:15.125
And the boy Samuel grew in the presence of the Lord.

112
00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:17.405
Now, Eli was very old.

113
00:06:17.425 --> 00:06:20.405
He kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel.

114
00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:22.085
How they lay with the women

115
00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:24.805
who were at the were serving at the

116
00:06:24.925 --> 00:06:26.005
entrance to the tent of meeting.

117
00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:29.805
And he said to them, why do you do such things for I hear

118
00:06:29.805 --> 00:06:31.885
of your evil dealings from all these people?

119
00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:35.405
No, my sons, it is no good report that I hear the people

120
00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:37.045
of the Lord spreading abroad.

121
00:06:37.985 --> 00:06:41.045
If someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him.

122
00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:45.125
But if someone sins against the Lord who can intercede

123
00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:48.125
for him, for they would not listen to the voice

124
00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:50.165
of their Father, for it was the will of the Lord

125
00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:52.245
to put them to death.

126
00:06:53.215 --> 00:06:56.355
Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature

127
00:06:56.695 --> 00:06:59.195
and in favor and also with man,

128
00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.675
this is the word of the Lord.

129
00:07:01.815 --> 00:07:04.995
You may be seated. Verse 11,

130
00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:08.275
here it sets up this righteous top line of the story

131
00:07:08.615 --> 00:07:13.035
as we see in full this picture of a worthy family

132
00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:17.035
and a worthy son, a worthy son.

133
00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:20.235
It says that Samuel's parents, Oana

134
00:07:20.235 --> 00:07:21.995
and Hannah, they go home to Rama.

135
00:07:22.835 --> 00:07:25.515
Remember Samuel is only three or four years old at this time

136
00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:26.995
and he is a little kid.

137
00:07:28.695 --> 00:07:30.035
And so imagine this mom

138
00:07:30.035 --> 00:07:33.675
and dad have circled through the drop off line at church.

139
00:07:34.735 --> 00:07:36.555
Hannah leans over to Little Samuel

140
00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:37.915
and says, give mommy a kiss.

141
00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:41.235
And she takes her thumb and rubs off the remaining

142
00:07:41.235 --> 00:07:42.875
breakfast on his cheek.

143
00:07:43.775 --> 00:07:47.155
But this drop off is different than any that we're used to.

144
00:07:47.665 --> 00:07:50.715
This drop off is permanent.

145
00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:55.885
And so after they've rung out every possible tear,

146
00:07:56.035 --> 00:07:57.805
said all their goodbyes, they,

147
00:07:58.155 --> 00:08:03.155
they ride away from Samuel

148
00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:06.575
A whole new category of pain

149
00:08:07.715 --> 00:08:11.535
and joy open up for us that we've never experienced

150
00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:15.415
before as we moved our oldest son Owen into college.

151
00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:19.865
And there was something otherworldly special about

152
00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:20.945
that final night together

153
00:08:20.965 --> 00:08:23.385
as we're circled up in the parking lot

154
00:08:23.445 --> 00:08:26.105
of Hideaway Pizza praying.

155
00:08:27.835 --> 00:08:29.415
And after we've said our goodbyes

156
00:08:30.595 --> 00:08:32.895
and we've rung out every possible tear,

157
00:08:33.915 --> 00:08:36.375
we ride away from Owen.

158
00:08:38.645 --> 00:08:42.145
And there's no longer six of us in the car. There's five.

159
00:08:43.405 --> 00:08:46.845
And what did we talk about on the drive home that night?

160
00:08:48.235 --> 00:08:52.445
Nothing. It's complete silence for over an hour.

161
00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:58.225
And when we get home, there's where Owen parks his truck

162
00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:01.065
normally and it's, it's empty.

163
00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:06.075
That's a difficult joy. It's a difficult joy.

164
00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:11.185
What was the ride home like for Elana and Hannah?

165
00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:13.465
Well, we know that Rama is

166
00:09:14.355 --> 00:09:17.065
about 15 miles away from Shiloh.

167
00:09:17.965 --> 00:09:19.345
And since they don't have a minivan,

168
00:09:19.365 --> 00:09:20.985
the journey takes about six hours.

169
00:09:23.035 --> 00:09:26.175
What did they talk about on that ride?

170
00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:28.685
Well, I imagine nothing.

171
00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:32.005
And that night, kids in those days

172
00:09:32.565 --> 00:09:34.405
normally slept really close to the parents.

173
00:09:35.265 --> 00:09:37.245
So imagine this as Oana

174
00:09:37.245 --> 00:09:38.965
and Hannah climbing into bed that night.

175
00:09:39.635 --> 00:09:41.925
Sammy's mat is empty.

176
00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:46.275
I'm sure that was a difficult joy for them.

177
00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:50.025
In Hannah's prayer verse one of this chapter,

178
00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:51.105
we saw this last week, she says,

179
00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.585
my heart exalts in the Lord.

180
00:09:54.485 --> 00:09:58.825
And this is her giving in even in giving her

181
00:09:58.825 --> 00:10:00.065
only son to the Lord.

182
00:10:00.205 --> 00:10:03.705
She is rejoicing, she's gladhearted in the Lord.

183
00:10:04.315 --> 00:10:06.305
She's not rejoicing that Samuel's gone,

184
00:10:06.885 --> 00:10:08.505
but she's rejoicing in the Lord.

185
00:10:08.505 --> 00:10:10.665
She's gladhearted in the God

186
00:10:10.765 --> 00:10:13.425
who we can trust in his good purposes.

187
00:10:13.685 --> 00:10:16.545
We know that he is good and she knows this.

188
00:10:17.905 --> 00:10:19.925
And Paul writes, in this state of being sorrowful

189
00:10:20.065 --> 00:10:22.725
yet always rejoicing, this is rejoicing that can be had

190
00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:24.805
only in the Lord.

191
00:10:27.795 --> 00:10:31.365
Paul. Paul writes that our kids are not our own.

192
00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.815
Love your kids. Grow them up in the Lord

193
00:10:35.315 --> 00:10:36.975
for they are his children.

194
00:10:39.085 --> 00:10:42.125
Samuel's left behind in the tabernacle to minister to

195
00:10:42.145 --> 00:10:45.165
or to serve the Lord under the care of Eli, the priest.

196
00:10:45.165 --> 00:10:47.685
And Eli isn't just a priest, he's the high priest.

197
00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:49.565
He's in charge of the tabernacle.

198
00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:53.765
He's the lion and lineage of Aaron and Levi here hear.

199
00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:58.285
So now the silence begins. Now buckle up.

200
00:10:58.965 --> 00:11:00.285
'cause we're about to be introduced to

201
00:11:00.975 --> 00:11:02.805
Eli's sons, HNI and Phineas.

202
00:11:03.575 --> 00:11:07.525
Verse 12. Now the sons of Eli were worthless men.

203
00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:11.635
That's an introduction, right? That's an introduction.

204
00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:16.115
Clearly these guys right outta the gate are worthless sons.

205
00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:17.635
Worthless sons.

206
00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:20.475
And the literal translation here says that the sons

207
00:11:20.475 --> 00:11:22.635
of Eli were sons of Al.

208
00:11:23.455 --> 00:11:27.955
And Al is a word that means worthlessness or destruction.

209
00:11:28.735 --> 00:11:33.235
And the word capital is capitalized also, Beil is as if

210
00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:36.315
to personify this idea of worthlessness.

211
00:11:37.175 --> 00:11:40.955
And Paul even talks of beil as another name

212
00:11:41.055 --> 00:11:43.675
for Satan in second Corinthians six 15.

213
00:11:44.455 --> 00:11:47.195
So these sons are worthless.

214
00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:50.995
Exclamation point, exclamation point.

215
00:11:53.015 --> 00:11:54.425
They are the opposite of Christ.

216
00:11:54.565 --> 00:11:56.665
So why are the sons worthless?

217
00:11:57.375 --> 00:11:59.425
Well, God gives us context clues here.

218
00:11:59.775 --> 00:12:01.265
They did not know the Lord.

219
00:12:01.895 --> 00:12:03.945
They didn't know the Lord, they didn't care about the Lord.

220
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:05.865
And they're worthless

221
00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:07.945
because of the train wreck of sin

222
00:12:07.945 --> 00:12:09.865
that's just about to explode.

223
00:12:14.565 --> 00:12:15.945
And what makes this especially painful

224
00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:17.145
is that these good for nothing.

225
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:18.505
Sons are priests

226
00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:20.825
and either of them are in line

227
00:12:20.825 --> 00:12:22.345
to be the high priest eventually.

228
00:12:22.645 --> 00:12:24.705
And priests were God's representatives

229
00:12:25.765 --> 00:12:27.425
and priests, as you know, were the mediators

230
00:12:27.425 --> 00:12:28.905
between God and his people.

231
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.985
And so what does mediator mean?

232
00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:34.705
A mediator offered a sacrifice on behalf of the people

233
00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:37.085
to atone for sins

234
00:12:37.085 --> 00:12:38.605
and to bring them back into right

235
00:12:38.605 --> 00:12:40.645
relationship with the Lord.

236
00:12:40.905 --> 00:12:43.085
And so the priest, they taught, they, they blessed,

237
00:12:43.085 --> 00:12:44.485
they interceded, they led worship.

238
00:12:44.715 --> 00:12:46.325
They, they did all these things.

239
00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:47.805
They led in all these ways,

240
00:12:48.425 --> 00:12:50.365
and yet they did not know the Lord.

241
00:12:51.345 --> 00:12:56.215
And it's shocking. Now, priests then were different than

242
00:12:57.165 --> 00:12:58.535
pastors are nowadays.

243
00:12:59.155 --> 00:13:03.835
But imagine an elder or a pastor teaching

244
00:13:03.975 --> 00:13:06.355
and feeding, leading, caring for the flock,

245
00:13:07.015 --> 00:13:08.325
but they don't know the Lord.

246
00:13:09.775 --> 00:13:14.265
It's shocking, right? But unfortunately not uncommon.

247
00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:17.345
It seems there's nothing new under the sun.

248
00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:21.585
And we'll see now at an example of the train wreck

249
00:13:21.585 --> 00:13:24.065
of wickedness in verse 13, what are they doing here?

250
00:13:24.445 --> 00:13:27.665
The suns are, are having their servants stick a fork into

251
00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:29.945
the pot and they're pulling up the best meat

252
00:13:30.005 --> 00:13:31.265
as much as they want.

253
00:13:32.785 --> 00:13:33.885
And you may not be aware of this,

254
00:13:33.905 --> 00:13:36.165
but priests in those days, according to

255
00:13:36.225 --> 00:13:39.245
to law priests were allowed some food from sacrifice,

256
00:13:40.415 --> 00:13:43.875
but only certain parts of the sacrifice,

257
00:13:43.875 --> 00:13:45.035
certain parts of the animal.

258
00:13:45.615 --> 00:13:47.395
And instead, Eli's sons are having a party,

259
00:13:47.395 --> 00:13:48.475
they're having a barbecue,

260
00:13:48.975 --> 00:13:51.955
and they're choosing the choice marveled

261
00:13:52.015 --> 00:13:53.275
ribeye for themselves.

262
00:13:55.385 --> 00:13:58.165
And these sons of of Eli are stealing from the people

263
00:13:58.265 --> 00:14:00.365
and they're stealing from the Lord.

264
00:14:01.605 --> 00:14:04.235
These guys are enjoying their best life now.

265
00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:06.475
They're enjoying life in the priesthood for

266
00:14:06.475 --> 00:14:08.195
what it gives them access to.

267
00:14:09.095 --> 00:14:11.465
And we'll see more of that here in a moment.

268
00:14:12.555 --> 00:14:15.085
They don't believe that these sacrifices are doing anything

269
00:14:15.865 --> 00:14:20.445
and therefore they are making a mockery of God.

270
00:14:22.785 --> 00:14:25.445
And so there at the end of verse 14, it says that this is

271
00:14:25.445 --> 00:14:28.125
what they did to everyone who came

272
00:14:28.145 --> 00:14:30.485
to worship there at the tabernacle.

273
00:14:30.635 --> 00:14:31.725
They didn't discriminate.

274
00:14:31.835 --> 00:14:35.485
They did it to everyone and they stole from the Lord.

275
00:14:37.235 --> 00:14:39.685
Paul writes to people like this in Philippians three 18,

276
00:14:39.715 --> 00:14:42.645
when he says their end is destruction,

277
00:14:42.735 --> 00:14:44.565
their God is their belly.

278
00:14:46.305 --> 00:14:48.445
And maybe you already feel something boiling up inside

279
00:14:48.445 --> 00:14:49.965
of you, some anger maybe, I hope,

280
00:14:52.005 --> 00:14:53.745
And let's set some expectations here.

281
00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:55.345
It's only going to get worse.

282
00:14:56.155 --> 00:14:57.945
We're gonna sin crescendo here.

283
00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.725
In verse 15, we see that the suns demand the meat

284
00:15:01.725 --> 00:15:04.445
to be raw just so they can cook, grill it

285
00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:06.365
however they want, instead of boiled

286
00:15:07.145 --> 00:15:11.905
and they demand the fat to you see in Leviticus three

287
00:15:11.925 --> 00:15:16.065
and seven that the fat is the best part of the offering

288
00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:18.945
and it's to be burned on the altar.

289
00:15:19.925 --> 00:15:23.905
And burning fat is giving the best to the Lord is not

290
00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:25.505
to be eaten by the priest, not to be eaten

291
00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:26.905
by the people it's giving

292
00:15:27.445 --> 00:15:30.425
to him what's exclusively the lord's.

293
00:15:32.575 --> 00:15:33.595
And you know this to be true.

294
00:15:33.655 --> 00:15:35.355
The fat is what gives the most flavor.

295
00:15:35.545 --> 00:15:38.075
It's what makes grilled meat smell amazing.

296
00:15:38.575 --> 00:15:41.075
And the Lord agrees, it's a, he accepts it

297
00:15:41.135 --> 00:15:43.795
as a pleasing sacrifice to him.

298
00:15:46.525 --> 00:15:49.385
And if the worshiper hesitates on these demands at all,

299
00:15:49.805 --> 00:15:51.785
the servants would take the animal by force.

300
00:15:53.015 --> 00:15:54.395
And I imagine the priests servant

301
00:15:55.595 --> 00:15:58.955
grabbing the sacrifice like a basketball player

302
00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:01.675
grabs the basketball and throws elbows

303
00:16:01.675 --> 00:16:04.715
and does everything he can to hold onto that meat.

304
00:16:06.255 --> 00:16:08.235
And I imagine it's a lot more forceful,

305
00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:09.995
more violent than that even.

306
00:16:11.765 --> 00:16:14.865
And so in this stealing, verse 17 says

307
00:16:16.215 --> 00:16:18.585
that the sin of the young men was very great

308
00:16:18.735 --> 00:16:22.785
because they treated the offering of the Lord with contempt.

309
00:16:24.245 --> 00:16:28.165
And sometimes I can be awkward.

310
00:16:29.515 --> 00:16:33.675
Am I alone in this affliction? Sounds like it.

311
00:16:33.985 --> 00:16:37.275
Okay, about 20 years ago, my wife

312
00:16:37.275 --> 00:16:40.875
and I, we were in Canada, we had just done a museum tour.

313
00:16:41.615 --> 00:16:45.435
And there at the exit is a man who asked me, he said,

314
00:16:45.435 --> 00:16:47.075
how was your tour today?

315
00:16:48.055 --> 00:16:49.235
And so I, I turned to him

316
00:16:49.255 --> 00:16:51.995
and I say, oh, it was, it was very great.

317
00:16:53.135 --> 00:16:55.715
And my wife, my wife smiles and looks at me

318
00:16:55.715 --> 00:16:57.835
and she says, it was very great

319
00:16:58.825 --> 00:17:01.395
because who talks like that?

320
00:17:02.295 --> 00:17:05.195
Nobody talks about something that they enjoy as

321
00:17:05.575 --> 00:17:06.675
as very great.

322
00:17:07.785 --> 00:17:11.835
Okay? Now what, what this passage is saying here

323
00:17:13.095 --> 00:17:16.275
is that it's not, when it says very great,

324
00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:19.515
it's not talking about how magnificent the sin was,

325
00:17:20.025 --> 00:17:22.435
it's talking about the magnitude of the sin.

326
00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:26.945
So this very great sin, it's describes the difference

327
00:17:27.025 --> 00:17:30.505
between their sin and the holiness of God.

328
00:17:31.415 --> 00:17:35.425
There's an infinite chasm there between what's on one side,

329
00:17:35.445 --> 00:17:39.265
the holiness and the pure and perfect righteousness of God

330
00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:44.625
and the the wicked thoughts, actions, attitudes

331
00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:46.025
of these sons.

332
00:17:47.865 --> 00:17:51.205
It's infinite, this chasm, it's very great.

333
00:17:53.335 --> 00:17:54.515
And the sin is very great

334
00:17:54.515 --> 00:17:57.435
because the, the brothers treated the offering of the Lord

335
00:17:57.465 --> 00:17:58.475
with contempt.

336
00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:01.755
In other words, they're dis disrespecting the offering.

337
00:18:01.785 --> 00:18:03.955
They are considering it worthless.

338
00:18:05.275 --> 00:18:06.455
Can you imagine that the worth,

339
00:18:06.455 --> 00:18:09.335
these worthless sons considering the things

340
00:18:09.395 --> 00:18:10.935
of God to be worthless.

341
00:18:13.845 --> 00:18:16.915
Think about your own giving to the church. It's sacrificial.

342
00:18:16.915 --> 00:18:18.595
It's costing you something.

343
00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:21.875
You're giving cheerfully as you've decided in your heart

344
00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:24.795
and worship to the one to whom all blessing, honor

345
00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:26.355
and glory is due.

346
00:18:27.835 --> 00:18:28.935
And you're acknowledging that

347
00:18:28.935 --> 00:18:31.015
what you're giving is his anyways.

348
00:18:31.845 --> 00:18:34.995
It's an act of worship. So think about

349
00:18:35.295 --> 00:18:38.035
how these priests are at least cutting off the worship

350
00:18:38.135 --> 00:18:40.195
of God's people of God.

351
00:18:41.135 --> 00:18:45.995
And at most they're turning people away from the Lord.

352
00:18:48.435 --> 00:18:53.215
And if you remember, Shiloh is the only tabernacle.

353
00:18:53.885 --> 00:18:55.655
It's not as if people who are upset

354
00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:59.655
by these sons could just go to the tabernacle down the road.

355
00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:03.335
Oh, there's, there's only one sticker on the back

356
00:19:03.335 --> 00:19:04.615
of everyone's donkey.

357
00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.775
And it's, and it's for Shiloh tabernacle

358
00:19:08.955 --> 00:19:11.175
and it's written in the papyrus font.

359
00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:16.825
These sons are evil, they're sinning,

360
00:19:16.825 --> 00:19:18.345
they're interfering with worship.

361
00:19:18.445 --> 00:19:19.865
And God is not pleased.

362
00:19:22.225 --> 00:19:25.365
And in all this, it seems like God is silent. Where is God?

363
00:19:25.505 --> 00:19:28.605
So in verse 18, by God's grace, we are jolted

364
00:19:28.605 --> 00:19:32.325
and relieved to hear a faint heartbeat of God.

365
00:19:32.705 --> 00:19:35.845
And by way of harsh contrast with the sons of Eli,

366
00:19:36.105 --> 00:19:39.965
we see the little Samuel and he is serving

367
00:19:40.185 --> 00:19:42.165
and he is growing in the Lord.

368
00:19:42.795 --> 00:19:44.685
He's walking in God's presence

369
00:19:46.315 --> 00:19:47.815
in a spiritual wasteland.

370
00:19:47.935 --> 00:19:51.935
Samuel stands as a young sapling and he is growing.

371
00:19:53.605 --> 00:19:55.585
It says that Samuel was ministering before the Lord

372
00:19:55.585 --> 00:19:57.745
and I, I wonder what that might have looked like And we have

373
00:19:57.935 --> 00:20:01.025
some idea of what that could look like in the next chapter.

374
00:20:01.165 --> 00:20:05.505
One Samuel three 15 Samuel lay until morning,

375
00:20:05.615 --> 00:20:08.185
then he opened the doors of the house of the Lord.

376
00:20:09.005 --> 00:20:11.305
And it seems that one of his duties was opening the house

377
00:20:11.325 --> 00:20:14.905
of the Lord to people who come to worship the Lord.

378
00:20:15.995 --> 00:20:17.975
And praise God for this example, it's so important.

379
00:20:18.035 --> 00:20:20.695
It reminds me of our faithful greeters

380
00:20:20.695 --> 00:20:21.895
here every Sunday morning.

381
00:20:22.315 --> 00:20:25.375
For me it's usually Troy and Mike. So thankful for them.

382
00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:27.095
But praise God for this.

383
00:20:27.395 --> 00:20:31.375
It prepares your heart for worship to be, to be greeted,

384
00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:32.775
and to have a warm smile

385
00:20:32.915 --> 00:20:34.975
as you enter into the house of the Lord.

386
00:20:35.785 --> 00:20:37.815
Every role is important,

387
00:20:37.815 --> 00:20:40.815
every part is important in God's church.

388
00:20:40.815 --> 00:20:42.735
First Corinthians 12, serve.

389
00:20:45.425 --> 00:20:47.165
So then at the end of the day, Samuel

390
00:20:48.085 --> 00:20:49.125
probably closed the doors.

391
00:20:49.775 --> 00:20:53.045
Maybe he cleaned the floors there of the tabernacle,

392
00:20:53.425 --> 00:20:56.085
likely imperfectly, somebody probably had to redo it.

393
00:20:56.745 --> 00:20:58.685
And he's probably running errands all over the place

394
00:20:58.785 --> 00:21:00.325
for the aging Eli.

395
00:21:01.775 --> 00:21:05.435
And in verse 18, Samuel is wearing a linen e fod,

396
00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:06.675
a linen E fod.

397
00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:09.635
It's priestly clothing. It's like a white apron.

398
00:21:10.215 --> 00:21:13.355
And it shows that he is training to be a priest.

399
00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:17.265
So Samuel's faithfulness shows us

400
00:21:17.265 --> 00:21:19.505
that we can serve the Lord faithfully,

401
00:21:20.295 --> 00:21:22.065
even in the midst of evil.

402
00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:27.785
So in verse 19, we see that each year Hannah's family comes

403
00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:29.505
to offer sacrifice.

404
00:21:30.565 --> 00:21:35.105
And we also see that Hannah brings Samuel something we see

405
00:21:35.105 --> 00:21:37.025
that Hannah makes a little robe to bring

406
00:21:37.025 --> 00:21:38.305
to Samuel every year.

407
00:21:39.205 --> 00:21:41.345
We already know Samuel's young, we know

408
00:21:41.345 --> 00:21:42.945
that he has to be little.

409
00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:47.225
We know that the robe has to be little to fit him.

410
00:21:47.365 --> 00:21:51.705
And yet scripture underscores this by using the word little.

411
00:21:53.295 --> 00:21:55.115
And I think that's there to emphasize

412
00:21:55.695 --> 00:21:57.835
the humanity, the emotion.

413
00:21:58.025 --> 00:21:59.115
It's in this family picture.

414
00:21:59.425 --> 00:22:03.755
It's not as if Hannah and Elana are robots

415
00:22:03.835 --> 00:22:04.875
and it's, hey, it's no big deal

416
00:22:04.935 --> 00:22:07.035
to drop off their little son.

417
00:22:07.895 --> 00:22:12.035
No, it's a close knit, loving family picture here.

418
00:22:13.795 --> 00:22:18.625
Every year she makes a little robe for her little Samuel

419
00:22:19.325 --> 00:22:21.585
and nothing makes her happier than to see him

420
00:22:22.325 --> 00:22:26.825
and to, to give him that robe because he's getting so big.

421
00:22:28.275 --> 00:22:30.375
You know? And there's something kind of cute also,

422
00:22:30.375 --> 00:22:34.055
when our tiny kids dress up in nice clothes like adults

423
00:22:34.665 --> 00:22:36.845
right around Christmas.

424
00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:39.445
Every year at our house, we have a a ton

425
00:22:39.465 --> 00:22:42.365
of ornaments including all these ornaments

426
00:22:42.395 --> 00:22:45.365
that our kids have made over all these years at

427
00:22:45.365 --> 00:22:47.125
church and at school.

428
00:22:47.665 --> 00:22:50.845
But there's always one ornament in particular

429
00:22:51.235 --> 00:22:53.045
that always gets us.

430
00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:57.645
And it's this, this ornament, this picture of Alec, our son

431
00:22:58.395 --> 00:23:02.885
when he was three and he's wearing this little red polo

432
00:23:04.185 --> 00:23:06.885
and I, I wish I had this picture to show you.

433
00:23:08.535 --> 00:23:11.315
Uh oh. Hey, I do. There we go.

434
00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:17.315
So every time I read this passage, I think of Alec

435
00:23:17.895 --> 00:23:20.035
in his little red polo

436
00:23:20.685 --> 00:23:24.255
because he's getting so big, right?

437
00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:30.415
So Hannah, she is once unable to bear children.

438
00:23:30.475 --> 00:23:33.175
And now the Lord has blessed her with six total,

439
00:23:33.175 --> 00:23:34.335
including Samuel.

440
00:23:35.775 --> 00:23:38.035
God poured out blessing on her in response

441
00:23:38.035 --> 00:23:41.155
to her faithfulness after she gave her first

442
00:23:41.245 --> 00:23:42.515
child back to the Lord.

443
00:23:43.795 --> 00:23:45.805
Now in verse 22, we drop back into the science.

444
00:23:46.105 --> 00:23:48.885
We see Eli's weak, rebuke his weak rebuke.

445
00:23:49.545 --> 00:23:51.965
So it's in, in these verses that we see that it had

446
00:23:51.965 --> 00:23:55.045
to have been excruciating for Hannah

447
00:23:55.065 --> 00:23:57.165
and Elana to drop Samuel off.

448
00:23:58.225 --> 00:24:00.405
You know Paul and Paul in Acts 20,

449
00:24:00.425 --> 00:24:04.605
he describes people like Eli's sons as fierce

450
00:24:05.665 --> 00:24:10.045
wolves, fierce wolves, people who attack the flock of God.

451
00:24:11.245 --> 00:24:16.225
And Hannah and Elna leave little Samuel with fierce wolves.

452
00:24:17.175 --> 00:24:20.635
And I believe that they knew that they were doing this too.

453
00:24:21.935 --> 00:24:25.275
Why? Because everybody is talking about it.

454
00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:27.815
What were they talking about it?

455
00:24:27.815 --> 00:24:30.575
We read it here that Eli's sons were sleeping with the women

456
00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:32.655
who served at the tabernacle.

457
00:24:33.085 --> 00:24:37.335
They're using their position of authority to take advantage

458
00:24:37.395 --> 00:24:39.495
of and hurt women.

459
00:24:40.895 --> 00:24:43.675
And this news is spreading abroad.

460
00:24:45.215 --> 00:24:46.555
And also did you catch that?

461
00:24:46.745 --> 00:24:50.515
That Eli kept hearing all that his sons were doing,

462
00:24:51.065 --> 00:24:55.555
that he kept hearing reveals a deadly

463
00:24:55.665 --> 00:24:59.875
passivity that ultimately brings judgment on

464
00:25:00.405 --> 00:25:05.235
Eli's household even though Eli was a

465
00:25:05.235 --> 00:25:08.515
devoted priest, even though he showed compassion to Hannah,

466
00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:12.155
even though that he was critical in the mentoring raising up

467
00:25:12.155 --> 00:25:15.485
of Samuel, he was passive

468
00:25:17.235 --> 00:25:18.615
in disciplining his sons.

469
00:25:18.615 --> 00:25:20.615
He was passive in that he didn't remove his

470
00:25:20.725 --> 00:25:22.015
sons from the priesthood.

471
00:25:22.395 --> 00:25:26.375
He chose his sons over the way of the Lord.

472
00:25:27.405 --> 00:25:32.285
And so judgment comes, Eli's probably in his nineties here

473
00:25:33.225 --> 00:25:35.405
as he eks out what seems

474
00:25:35.425 --> 00:25:37.845
to be his very first rebuke of his children.

475
00:25:39.885 --> 00:25:41.785
And so Eli tells his sons later,

476
00:25:42.125 --> 00:25:44.545
if someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him.

477
00:25:44.565 --> 00:25:47.545
But if someone sins against the Lord who can intercede

478
00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:51.965
for him, this is a hint to us that we need a mediator.

479
00:25:53.935 --> 00:25:56.155
And devastatingly ends the second half

480
00:25:56.255 --> 00:25:57.995
of verse 25, we lead that.

481
00:25:57.995 --> 00:26:01.875
We read that Eli's sons would not listen to the voice

482
00:26:01.895 --> 00:26:04.395
of their father because it was the will of the Lord

483
00:26:04.695 --> 00:26:06.035
to put them to death.

484
00:26:07.235 --> 00:26:11.535
And that seems to say that the will of the Lord

485
00:26:12.755 --> 00:26:16.255
was that uh, that they, that they wouldn't listen

486
00:26:16.255 --> 00:26:20.515
to their father, the will of the Lord to put their sons

487
00:26:20.635 --> 00:26:25.395
to death, puts and reveals a severe judgment against them.

488
00:26:26.755 --> 00:26:29.375
And it goes beyond just disobedience.

489
00:26:30.835 --> 00:26:33.025
Their hearts had become so hardened

490
00:26:33.845 --> 00:26:36.305
and their contempt for God's holiness so severe

491
00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:39.465
that repentance was no longer possible.

492
00:26:41.235 --> 00:26:43.230
And this is a sobering picture, isn't it?

493
00:26:43.675 --> 00:26:47.805
Even those who seem to be a part of God's church

494
00:26:48.665 --> 00:26:53.085
can face severe eternal consequences if they continue

495
00:26:53.105 --> 00:26:57.705
to defy the Lord RC spro

496
00:26:57.705 --> 00:26:58.825
and writing on the holiness of God.

497
00:26:58.825 --> 00:27:02.625
He wrote, God's grace is not infinite.

498
00:27:03.835 --> 00:27:05.495
God is infinite. God is gracious.

499
00:27:05.955 --> 00:27:08.415
We experience the grace of an of an infinite God.

500
00:27:08.435 --> 00:27:10.375
But grace is not infinite.

501
00:27:10.875 --> 00:27:13.575
God sets limits to his patience and forbearance.

502
00:27:13.875 --> 00:27:15.455
And he warns us over

503
00:27:15.555 --> 00:27:17.655
and over again that someday the ax will fall

504
00:27:17.915 --> 00:27:20.015
and his judgment will be poured out.

505
00:27:21.195 --> 00:27:25.255
That's right. Eli's weak rebuke fell on deaf ears

506
00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:29.975
and the ax sharpened by their own sin

507
00:27:30.625 --> 00:27:32.015
falls on them.

508
00:27:33.325 --> 00:27:35.295
They didn't know the Lord, they didn't care about the Lord.

509
00:27:35.365 --> 00:27:36.975
They were worthless.

510
00:27:37.875 --> 00:27:40.855
And here this, the Lord will protect his name.

511
00:27:41.085 --> 00:27:43.935
Ezekiel 36 23 says this,

512
00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:47.455
and I will vindicate the holiness of my great name,

513
00:27:47.585 --> 00:27:48.775
which has been profaned

514
00:27:48.775 --> 00:27:51.735
among the nations in which you have profaned among them.

515
00:27:52.715 --> 00:27:53.775
And the nations will know

516
00:27:53.775 --> 00:27:56.655
that I am the Lord declares the Lord God when through you,

517
00:27:56.895 --> 00:28:00.535
I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.

518
00:28:02.265 --> 00:28:06.085
That's right. God will vindicate the holiness

519
00:28:06.105 --> 00:28:07.565
of his great name

520
00:28:08.705 --> 00:28:12.205
and for what purpose so that the nations will know

521
00:28:12.205 --> 00:28:14.165
that he is the Lord.

522
00:28:16.275 --> 00:28:19.815
And now verse 26, God's heartbeat sounds in the silence.

523
00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:24.955
Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature

524
00:28:24.955 --> 00:28:26.035
and in favor with the Lord

525
00:28:26.035 --> 00:28:30.835
and also with man, we see that Samuel is worthy of favor.

526
00:28:32.535 --> 00:28:34.475
He continues growing and he's growing in favor

527
00:28:34.545 --> 00:28:35.795
with not just the Lord,

528
00:28:35.795 --> 00:28:38.515
but also with man, which is important to see

529
00:28:38.515 --> 00:28:40.915
because it shows that people are starting to see

530
00:28:41.335 --> 00:28:43.275
and recognize his faithfulness,

531
00:28:43.495 --> 00:28:45.355
his integrity, his godliness.

532
00:28:46.595 --> 00:28:49.975
See this also the verse also draws a clear line from

533
00:28:49.995 --> 00:28:51.695
Samuel to Jesus.

534
00:28:51.875 --> 00:28:54.735
And maybe this peaked something in your mind as he read this

535
00:28:55.425 --> 00:28:57.015
Jesus increase.

536
00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:58.175
And this is Luke 2 52.

537
00:28:58.175 --> 00:29:01.175
Jesus increase in wisdom and in stature

538
00:29:01.175 --> 00:29:02.495
and in favor with God

539
00:29:02.635 --> 00:29:06.505
and man, the parallel is no accident.

540
00:29:07.325 --> 00:29:11.945
Samuel is a type of Christ, which means

541
00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:16.825
that he's meant to remind us of or point us to Christ.

542
00:29:18.635 --> 00:29:21.055
And as Samuel walked faithfully in God's presence,

543
00:29:21.115 --> 00:29:25.805
God considered him worthy a favor from God and from man.

544
00:29:26.905 --> 00:29:28.715
What do we do with this passage today?

545
00:29:28.715 --> 00:29:31.515
Knowing that he is the one who brings low

546
00:29:31.515 --> 00:29:33.875
and he is the one who exalts?

547
00:29:34.465 --> 00:29:36.355
Well, three things I believe.

548
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:39.755
We listen, we rise and we respond.

549
00:29:39.975 --> 00:29:44.565
Listen, rise and respond. LRR first.

550
00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:48.745
Listen. Maybe you're trapped in a time

551
00:29:48.755 --> 00:29:51.465
where it seems like God is silent

552
00:29:52.465 --> 00:29:54.925
and his heart heartbeat is so hard to hear,

553
00:29:54.985 --> 00:29:56.125
the silence is deafening.

554
00:29:56.785 --> 00:29:58.205
The tears won't stop.

555
00:29:59.495 --> 00:30:02.275
And you keep wondering, how did this happen?

556
00:30:03.445 --> 00:30:06.265
How did this happen? Over and over and over again.

557
00:30:06.265 --> 00:30:10.935
You ask this question, listen for the heartbeat

558
00:30:10.935 --> 00:30:14.515
of God, Deuteronomy 31 declares,

559
00:30:14.515 --> 00:30:17.635
it is the Lord your God who goes with you.

560
00:30:18.095 --> 00:30:21.155
He will not leave you or forsake you.

561
00:30:21.815 --> 00:30:26.145
Matthew 11 assures us that his burden is meant to be light.

562
00:30:26.715 --> 00:30:29.105
Psalm 68 says that he daily bears us up.

563
00:30:29.105 --> 00:30:33.905
Psalm 34 says that he is close to the to the broken hearted.

564
00:30:34.845 --> 00:30:37.225
And then Romans eight declares that he is

565
00:30:37.765 --> 00:30:41.665
providentially working good in every cir circumstance

566
00:30:42.605 --> 00:30:44.065
for those who are his children.

567
00:30:45.295 --> 00:30:48.725
These are the heartbeats of truth from God's word.

568
00:30:49.545 --> 00:30:52.485
So reach out link arms to somebody who can walk.

569
00:30:52.505 --> 00:30:55.765
You walk alongside you with these truths.

570
00:30:56.465 --> 00:31:00.085
You're not designed to struggle alone.

571
00:31:01.115 --> 00:31:03.525
Come up to us after the service down here.

572
00:31:03.915 --> 00:31:06.525
We'd love to listen to you, pray for you

573
00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:09.805
and get you connected to someone there.

574
00:31:13.375 --> 00:31:16.315
Listen for his heartbeat. He's not silent.

575
00:31:17.495 --> 00:31:18.875
Second, we rise.

576
00:31:19.495 --> 00:31:21.475
We see that God is faithful to exalt

577
00:31:21.495 --> 00:31:24.715
or raise up the righteous even in the midst of corruption.

578
00:31:25.655 --> 00:31:28.555
So even when it seems like the world is spinning out

579
00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:31.505
of control, God is in control.

580
00:31:32.835 --> 00:31:35.215
Isaiah 46, 10 says,

581
00:31:36.665 --> 00:31:40.925
and he is faithful to raise up righteous leaders just

582
00:31:40.945 --> 00:31:42.565
as he was with Samuel.

583
00:31:43.345 --> 00:31:45.285
Not perfect leaders of course,

584
00:31:46.385 --> 00:31:49.165
but pray for support those who God raises up

585
00:31:49.765 --> 00:31:51.285
faithful pastors, elders, leaders

586
00:31:51.705 --> 00:31:54.205
who model godliness and integrity.

587
00:31:55.645 --> 00:31:57.145
And so when I say leaders,

588
00:31:57.145 --> 00:31:58.705
though it's important to understand this.

589
00:31:59.055 --> 00:32:02.355
Does that mean just a select few? No.

590
00:32:02.395 --> 00:32:06.795
I believe every one of us in here can lead righteously,

591
00:32:08.215 --> 00:32:11.115
if not by position, but influentially.

592
00:32:13.175 --> 00:32:15.195
And so maybe this question is for you.

593
00:32:15.895 --> 00:32:18.635
Is God raising you up?

594
00:32:19.655 --> 00:32:21.035
Is God raising you up?

595
00:32:22.075 --> 00:32:25.255
For example, are you able to teach English?

596
00:32:26.905 --> 00:32:30.365
Let me ask you to commit to a year

597
00:32:30.365 --> 00:32:33.765
of teaching English in beautiful North Africa.

598
00:32:34.305 --> 00:32:36.805
Why? Because I promise you,

599
00:32:37.265 --> 00:32:40.645
God will use you in ways you could never imagine.

600
00:32:41.985 --> 00:32:44.365
If that's you, come talk to me after the service.

601
00:32:46.025 --> 00:32:48.085
Is God raising you up for that?

602
00:32:49.895 --> 00:32:51.075
Or are you a dentist?

603
00:32:52.165 --> 00:32:53.905
And I know that's a very specific question,

604
00:32:54.525 --> 00:32:56.585
but there's a very specific need for you

605
00:32:57.245 --> 00:32:58.465
at ministries of Jesus.

606
00:32:59.405 --> 00:33:01.265
If that's you, come talk to me afterward.

607
00:33:01.305 --> 00:33:04.425
I can get you connected to ministries of Jesus for that.

608
00:33:04.425 --> 00:33:07.585
If you know a dentist, put a bug in their ear, we need you.

609
00:33:09.095 --> 00:33:12.045
There are a million other places to serve.

610
00:33:12.555 --> 00:33:16.245
hhbc.com/serve. Help.

611
00:33:18.135 --> 00:33:22.775
God is faithful to raise up righteous leaders. Is that you?

612
00:33:25.305 --> 00:33:27.775
Third, we respond. Consider this.

613
00:33:27.775 --> 00:33:29.215
Maybe if you're honest with yourself.

614
00:33:29.225 --> 00:33:31.855
Maybe your life looks more closely

615
00:33:32.035 --> 00:33:34.055
to Eli's sons than it does Samuel.

616
00:33:34.795 --> 00:33:38.475
You've been searching for true deep joy

617
00:33:39.215 --> 00:33:40.315
and you can't find it.

618
00:33:40.335 --> 00:33:41.835
In fact, you seem to be murder.

619
00:33:41.855 --> 00:33:44.275
Moving further and further away from that,

620
00:33:45.075 --> 00:33:46.115
I want you to hear this.

621
00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:50.595
There's hope. The sacrificial system that

622
00:33:51.125 --> 00:33:54.635
Eli's sons corrupted point forward to the perfect

623
00:33:55.625 --> 00:33:59.275
uncorrupted unto sacrifice

624
00:33:59.305 --> 00:34:01.555
that Christ would offer on the cross.

625
00:34:03.335 --> 00:34:06.715
Christ succeeds as our great high priest

626
00:34:07.525 --> 00:34:10.275
where Eli and his sons failed

627
00:34:12.025 --> 00:34:14.275
through Jesus' death, his resurrection.

628
00:34:15.015 --> 00:34:18.035
We are no longer condemned by our sin.

629
00:34:18.175 --> 00:34:22.035
Romans eight, one declares even our

630
00:34:22.585 --> 00:34:27.275
very great sin and we have new life in him.

631
00:34:29.415 --> 00:34:31.675
So if you haven't already, today's your day,

632
00:34:32.745 --> 00:34:34.475
respond in faith,

633
00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:38.955
trusting in the finished work of Christ.

634
00:34:41.005 --> 00:34:43.755
Trust him as your king and your savior.

635
00:34:44.935 --> 00:34:48.555
We listen, we rise, we respond in praise

636
00:34:49.015 --> 00:34:50.435
to our king.

637
00:34:51.835 --> 00:34:54.715
'cause He is the one who brings low

638
00:34:55.455 --> 00:34:57.995
and he is the one who exalts.
