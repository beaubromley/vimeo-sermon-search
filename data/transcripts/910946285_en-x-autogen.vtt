00:00:01.545 --> 00:00:01.765
Hi.

2
00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:06.325
So we're, we're going to, uh, we are recording this one.

3
00:00:06.665 --> 00:00:09.365
Uh, did anybody figure out what next week is?

4
00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:13.525
Bowl? Bowl, Super Bowl Sunday, right?

5
00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:18.165
Tim won't be here. Accurate

6
00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:19.165
Statement. So be,

7
00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:23.005
be careful to not ask somebody here.

8
00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:27.125
But, um, so that dawned on me this week,

9
00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.805
and I, I communicated a little bit with Jimmy Quinn,

10
00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:33.165
and we don't, the problem is we we're gonna be getting into,

11
00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:36.445
um, spring break if we extend it.

12
00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:39.925
So here's what we're gonna, I'm gonna propose,

13
00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:42.805
see if we got kind of a consensus on this.

14
00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:48.165
Um, see, it wouldn't be smart for you men to have

15
00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:51.765
to tell your wife, I picked Super Bowl

16
00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:54.245
over the marriage in Richmond.

17
00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:57.245
Course. That's a bad place to put it. What

18
00:00:57.245 --> 00:00:59.045
If your wife tells you she picks us?

19
00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:02.685
Tim, I, I think,

20
00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:05.125
I think we've got something in common here.

21
00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:07.725
I didn't mind, but,

22
00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:09.315
Okay. So

23
00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:11.605
are we having a watch party at your house?

24
00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:16.125
Well, we still wouldn't cover the material that way.

25
00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:19.965
So there are people I've been told

26
00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:25.845
who could care less about a Super Bowl, so we're gonna, but,

27
00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:29.565
but finding two together, Savannah, that might be hard.

28
00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:32.245
So please hear this.

29
00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:35.325
Please hear this in the best sense of the framework.

30
00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.525
We're gonna record it.

31
00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:41.445
And I actually don't know how to, uh,

32
00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:43.525
distribute the recording,

33
00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:45.445
but I know there are people who do.

34
00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:48.685
And, uh, so I'm gonna record it, uh,

35
00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.365
just like I'm doing tonight.

36
00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:54.685
And so if you choose to not be here,

37
00:01:56.205 --> 00:01:57.205
I just encourage you,

38
00:01:57.205 --> 00:01:59.445
just pick a time when you can watch the recording

39
00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:00.685
together, okay?

40
00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:03.605
Mm-Hmm. How's that sound? Very good. Is that good enough?

41
00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:09.565
And, uh, so our, our community groups having one

42
00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:11.125
of those Super Bowl parties,

43
00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:14.125
but we figured out we can get there for dessert.

44
00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:18.445
That's all I care about. Alright.

45
00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:23.965
Anybody, uh, want to just say that book was hard

46
00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:25.645
or good or meaningful?

47
00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:28.645
Anybody get anything out of their weak digging into it?

48
00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:29.925
Mm-Hmm. Okay.

49
00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:32.965
Joyce and I have been involved with that ministry

50
00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.845
for 30 years now, either on staff

51
00:02:35.845 --> 00:02:37.045
for about 10 of those years.

52
00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:39.845
Um, closely connected

53
00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:42.835
and doing, doing some projects for them,

54
00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:45.075
uh, the other years.

55
00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:50.595
And we believe that's the best presentation

56
00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:51.755
of the material so far.

57
00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:55.235
And there's a lot more available should you want it.

58
00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:58.675
There's a, these principles are

59
00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.165
all about loving God and loving others.

60
00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:04.325
And there's, they have books on children and,

61
00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:06.525
and parenting and all kinds of things.

62
00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:10.765
So that's, you can access it there. Okay.

63
00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:15.725
So tonight we're gonna be talking more about

64
00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:18.885
how we grow as a couple

65
00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:24.525
by experiencing biblical principles so

66
00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:27.285
that we take head knowledge and live it out.

67
00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:32.725
So, um, that's kind of the focus for tonight.

68
00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:36.565
And we're gonna talk about one of the major, um,

69
00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:41.605
can't think of the word sidetracking, things that,

70
00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:45.325
or things that hinders us from connecting.

71
00:03:46.865 --> 00:03:51.245
And when we first heard this particular hindrance talked

72
00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:55.985
about and taught, uh, it was one of those things

73
00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.945
that I would have to say I had never

74
00:03:57.945 --> 00:03:59.145
thought about that before.

75
00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:01.225
Certainly from a biblical perspective.

76
00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:04.905
And that's gonna be the topic of aloneness.

77
00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:08.665
So if you, if you were at the workshop, as many of you were

78
00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:09.905
that we did on a Friday night

79
00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:13.265
and Saturday morning, this will be a bit redundant,

80
00:04:13.645 --> 00:04:16.585
but I suspect it'll come out a little differently

81
00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:18.025
than I did it the first time.

82
00:04:18.965 --> 00:04:22.185
And, uh, second thing is, we have never grown tired.

83
00:04:22.405 --> 00:04:25.025
If you're in Dr. Ferguson teach the same stuff,

84
00:04:25.735 --> 00:04:28.385
it's almost like, well, he must be teaching the Bible

85
00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:30.225
because it's got more for you

86
00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:34.265
even when you read it over 10 times, right?

87
00:04:34.815 --> 00:04:37.585
It's kind of like, it's new every morning, right?

88
00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.985
So, uh, one of the key things we're gonna talk about

89
00:04:43.605 --> 00:04:48.295
is learning to see people the way God sees 'em in order

90
00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:52.255
to love them the way he loves them, to see people,

91
00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:54.535
the way he sees them in order

92
00:04:54.535 --> 00:04:55.975
to love them the way he loves them.

93
00:04:56.765 --> 00:05:00.415
What that implies is perhaps sometimes we don't see people

94
00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:01.895
as they truly are,

95
00:05:03.495 --> 00:05:06.515
or we misinterpret what's going on

96
00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:11.355
or what they mean, or what they're thinking

97
00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:13.675
and maybe what they're feeling.

98
00:05:16.095 --> 00:05:20.555
Um, you probably heard this old, um, story of

99
00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.525
someone who gets on the subway in New York City

100
00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:28.445
and sees this man, middle-aged man

101
00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:32.765
sitting down and he's got three

102
00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:35.885
or four kids of his running around him

103
00:05:36.425 --> 00:05:37.485
and they're out of control.

104
00:05:38.035 --> 00:05:39.805
They're like making all kinds of noise.

105
00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:40.965
They're bumping into people,

106
00:05:41.715 --> 00:05:43.285
they're kind of being a nuisance.

107
00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:47.045
And finally, this man that got on the subway

108
00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.725
and witnessed that says to the men,

109
00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:53.165
why don't you take control of your kids?

110
00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:56.365
You're just letting them run rampant.

111
00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:02.365
And then he says, um,

112
00:06:03.835 --> 00:06:07.845
then, then the man who was sitting down, who is the father

113
00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:11.965
of the kid said, I'm sure you don't, in didn't, didn't think

114
00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:14.245
of this, but we just came from the hospital

115
00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:15.725
where their mother died.

116
00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.205
You see, that's a way we're not seeing people

117
00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:22.325
the way God sees 'em.

118
00:06:22.425 --> 00:06:24.685
Mm-Hmm. We don't begin

119
00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:27.365
to understand what's going on in people's hearts.

120
00:06:27.475 --> 00:06:28.885
Half of the time. Now,

121
00:06:29.785 --> 00:06:32.405
You Should be, if you've been married in length

122
00:06:32.405 --> 00:06:36.645
of time at all, hopefully you do know how to kind of predict

123
00:06:36.755 --> 00:06:40.005
what your spouse is thinking because you've been with them

124
00:06:40.425 --> 00:06:41.965
and you've been around them, and you can

125
00:06:41.965 --> 00:06:43.005
kind of start to predict.

126
00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:48.285
But it's dangerous to make judgements without

127
00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:50.725
lovingly checking them out.

128
00:06:52.985 --> 00:06:56.405
So if I walk in the door when I get home from the office

129
00:06:56.545 --> 00:06:57.685
and I see Joyce

130
00:06:57.825 --> 00:07:00.685
and she immediately frowns it in my direction,

131
00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:06.505
my default interpretation

132
00:07:06.565 --> 00:07:08.945
of her frown is, she's mad at me again.

133
00:07:10.535 --> 00:07:14.185
What have I done now? But that's an assumption.

134
00:07:15.015 --> 00:07:18.425
Even if it's happened a hundred times

135
00:07:18.685 --> 00:07:20.665
before, it's still an assumption.

136
00:07:20.885 --> 00:07:22.865
Mm-Hmm. Does that make sense? Yeah. Mm-Hmm.

137
00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.585
So one thing we wanna do is always slow down the process

138
00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:27.865
and say, Hmm,

139
00:07:31.025 --> 00:07:31.945
I think you're frowning.

140
00:07:33.845 --> 00:07:38.745
What's going on? Help me understand, is it me?

141
00:07:41.165 --> 00:07:44.865
And there's more tools to learn to what if it is okay,

142
00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:48.665
but it could be just got, just got bad news

143
00:07:49.655 --> 00:07:54.175
from somebody and the look was still on my face.

144
00:07:54.805 --> 00:07:57.095
Okay? So that's key point,

145
00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.375
seeing people the way God sees them,

146
00:08:00.395 --> 00:08:02.535
so we can love them the way he loves 'em.

147
00:08:02.765 --> 00:08:05.455
Okay, we're gonna watch a video tonight

148
00:08:06.205 --> 00:08:09.895
that introduces you to the authors,

149
00:08:10.075 --> 00:08:14.655
the primary authors of Call to Love, uh, David

150
00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:16.095
and Theresa Ferguson.

151
00:08:17.355 --> 00:08:20.335
And, uh, this video I think is not more

152
00:08:20.335 --> 00:08:21.455
than three minutes long.

153
00:08:22.155 --> 00:08:25.615
And, uh, what they are going to introduce you to

154
00:08:27.195 --> 00:08:31.255
is, uh, kind of how their journey started.

155
00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:37.855
And, um, I think it would be true

156
00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:41.695
to say they're probably in the top 10% of degree

157
00:08:41.695 --> 00:08:44.775
of difficulty of starting a marriage.

158
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:50.415
Okay. You'll see why. So stay handy.

159
00:08:50.415 --> 00:08:51.415
Cameron,

160
00:08:51.955 --> 00:08:54.895
Did you want the recording to see the

161
00:08:54.895 --> 00:08:55.895
Screen? Ooh,

162
00:08:55.895 --> 00:09:00.565
that would be good. Yes. You just gonna hold it?

163
00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:01.885
That's fine. Thank you.

164
00:09:06.525 --> 00:09:08.965
I knew that was a possibility, but knowing how to do it,

165
00:09:10.315 --> 00:09:12.565
That what I said, I knew that was a possibility,

166
00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.165
but somebody actually knowing how to do it.

167
00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:17.205
Oh yeah, yeah. That's very much appreciated.

168
00:09:17.965 --> 00:09:21.405
I just ran it backwards. That's easy to fix.

169
00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:22.565
So I think I can do that.

170
00:09:30.035 --> 00:09:31.035
Good to go? Yep.

171
00:09:32.795 --> 00:09:33.965
Patrica and I share some

172
00:09:33.965 --> 00:09:35.885
of our own journey into marriage intimacy.

173
00:09:36.005 --> 00:09:38.565
I think we're gonna provide some hope to most. Any couple.

174
00:09:38.785 --> 00:09:41.565
You see, we got married in rebellion. We were 16 years old.

175
00:09:42.065 --> 00:09:44.245
Um, now we don't recommend that, but we did that

176
00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:46.925
and endured, uh, quite a bit of pain for a lot of years.

177
00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:48.405
Uh, we came to faith

178
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.405
and following Jesus in our early twenties

179
00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:52.405
and, uh, begin to try to make up

180
00:09:52.405 --> 00:09:54.125
for lost time, try to heal some things.

181
00:09:54.305 --> 00:09:57.485
And yet I remember probably 10, 12 years into marriage,

182
00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:01.725
I asked her one night, uh, Theresa, do you really love me?

183
00:10:02.985 --> 00:10:04.605
It was hard for me to answer that question

184
00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:07.725
because we had had so much pain in our marriage those early

185
00:10:07.725 --> 00:10:11.565
years that, um, it was painful for me to have to say

186
00:10:11.565 --> 00:10:13.245
that I didn't feel anything from David

187
00:10:13.555 --> 00:10:16.885
because those early years we had hurt each other so deeply

188
00:10:17.145 --> 00:10:19.845
and never knew really how to resolve all those hurt.

189
00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:22.245
And she'll be sharing with you a little bit.

190
00:10:22.265 --> 00:10:24.645
For example, even our honeymoon hurt a little bit

191
00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:25.805
later in this series.

192
00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:29.045
Uh, and yet as we began to find some principles

193
00:10:29.065 --> 00:10:30.125
to really bring health

194
00:10:30.185 --> 00:10:31.365
and healing in our marriage,

195
00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:35.125
I can remember one very hopeful time when we were about

196
00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:38.045
to head off to one of our favorite, uh, trips in, uh,

197
00:10:38.265 --> 00:10:40.525
the Smoky Mountains, meet some other couples up there,

198
00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:41.925
enjoy a few days away.

199
00:10:41.925 --> 00:10:43.605
And we were kind of going through the house.

200
00:10:43.785 --> 00:10:44.925
So she was already in the car

201
00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:46.965
and I was being the dutiful husband.

202
00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:50.525
I was locking doors and turning off lights and, uh, checking

203
00:10:50.785 --> 00:10:51.965
The first and only time.

204
00:10:52.745 --> 00:10:54.445
And So I got to the kitchen.

205
00:10:54.545 --> 00:10:56.805
And I remember having this thought, David,

206
00:10:56.955 --> 00:10:59.085
last year when you were up at this mountain retreat center,

207
00:10:59.315 --> 00:11:02.205
they did not have sweet and low for your wife's coffee.

208
00:11:03.265 --> 00:11:05.485
Uh, and I drink my coffee black,

209
00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:07.485
but there needs to be pink stuff in hers.

210
00:11:07.485 --> 00:11:09.565
And yellow goes in oatmeal or something

211
00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:10.645
and blue goes in something.

212
00:11:10.645 --> 00:11:12.565
It's pretty complex loving people these days.

213
00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.285
And so anyway, I remember getting

214
00:11:14.285 --> 00:11:16.445
that pink stuff outta the cabinet, put in my briefcase,

215
00:11:16.505 --> 00:11:17.765
didn't tell her that I had it.

216
00:11:18.105 --> 00:11:20.805
Uh, we went on, uh, flew up to Asheville, North Carolina,

217
00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:22.925
got in a rented car, got to the top of the mountain,

218
00:11:23.385 --> 00:11:26.045
had dinner with each friends, bring the dessert,

219
00:11:26.195 --> 00:11:28.405
they bring the coffee, and she's looking around.

220
00:11:28.615 --> 00:11:29.805
There is no sweet lu.

221
00:11:30.145 --> 00:11:31.965
And I love to say the husband's, uh,

222
00:11:31.965 --> 00:11:33.685
you don not think I'm excited or what.

223
00:11:34.035 --> 00:11:35.645
Pull that sweet low outta my pocket.

224
00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:38.325
Come riding in on a white horse to rescue my wife.

225
00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:40.725
And, uh, and she was celebrating.

226
00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:42.485
She had little tears in her eyes

227
00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:45.325
and communicated a sense of feeling loved.

228
00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:48.005
And I remember having two thoughts.

229
00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:50.685
One, how simple it is to love people.

230
00:11:51.065 --> 00:11:53.045
And it was one of those things that I had missed for

231
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.365
so many years of

232
00:11:54.875 --> 00:11:57.685
what we would now call taking thought of her.

233
00:11:58.145 --> 00:12:00.725
And, uh, so it was a real transformative but hopeful moment.

234
00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:03.565
The second thought I remember having was one,

235
00:12:03.645 --> 00:12:05.565
I think from the Lord that kind of said, now David,

236
00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:07.045
didn't we do good?

237
00:12:08.225 --> 00:12:10.325
See David, I needed you to kind

238
00:12:10.325 --> 00:12:12.005
of bring this sweet low up the mountain,

239
00:12:12.225 --> 00:12:13.845
but I promise you, you needed me

240
00:12:13.845 --> 00:12:16.205
to remind you in the kitchen back in Texas.

241
00:12:17.265 --> 00:12:19.605
And there was that sense in which that God

242
00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:22.845
and I had just partnered together, if you will, to love her.

243
00:12:22.845 --> 00:12:25.005
Well. And for me, that was a really exciting,

244
00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:27.685
transformative moment of what marriage, intimacy,

245
00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:29.245
and this journey is all about.

246
00:12:29.525 --> 00:12:31.125
Partnering together with the Lord

247
00:12:31.545 --> 00:12:33.845
to love this one person really well.

248
00:12:38.695 --> 00:12:40.705
Okay, my hope is

249
00:12:41.975 --> 00:12:43.705
another video doesn't start up

250
00:12:44.475 --> 00:12:46.225
while I'm talking about this one.

251
00:12:47.405 --> 00:12:51.025
That's, uh, that's something we tried to kind

252
00:12:51.025 --> 00:12:52.825
of plant the seed of last week.

253
00:12:53.245 --> 00:12:55.305
Did you need, did you need to put that back and record?

254
00:12:56.255 --> 00:13:00.185
I've got it. It's going. Yeah. This, this is, uh, my laptop.

255
00:13:00.445 --> 00:13:03.385
I'm sorry. That's okay. Mm-Hmm. I don't mind that.

256
00:13:04.285 --> 00:13:08.105
Um, this is something we tried to kind of plant the seed of

257
00:13:08.115 --> 00:13:10.185
where the idea that

258
00:13:11.685 --> 00:13:14.225
my first job on planet earth

259
00:13:16.725 --> 00:13:19.145
is to love the Lord with everything I got.

260
00:13:19.605 --> 00:13:21.545
And I'm still a work in progress on that.

261
00:13:22.285 --> 00:13:25.385
But my second job is to love those near me.

262
00:13:25.585 --> 00:13:29.145
Well, and I'm still a work in progress on that too.

263
00:13:30.525 --> 00:13:33.145
But that paradigm is freeing.

264
00:13:33.935 --> 00:13:37.725
It's not about me, my job,

265
00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:42.565
it's about serving her as I'm following the Lord, partnering

266
00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:46.575
with Jesus, getting in the yoke with Jesus

267
00:13:46.835 --> 00:13:47.855
to love her well.

268
00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:51.805
And if she's doing the same basic thing,

269
00:13:52.215 --> 00:13:54.885
we're probably going to make it right.

270
00:13:57.125 --> 00:13:58.765
'cause he'll pick us up and dust us off

271
00:13:58.765 --> 00:14:00.885
and give us a do over if we mess up.

272
00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:04.605
'cause that's what grace is all about.

273
00:14:05.785 --> 00:14:07.445
So just wanted to kind of plant that.

274
00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:12.125
Now I wanna move into this, uh, um, issue

275
00:14:12.665 --> 00:14:13.965
of aloneness.

276
00:14:14.905 --> 00:14:19.325
See, you can be married and often feel alone.

277
00:14:22.135 --> 00:14:25.075
We were 18 years until you married. That's right.

278
00:14:25.075 --> 00:14:28.075
In fact, that was our wake up call was we go

279
00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:30.155
to a seminar thinking we're gonna get something

280
00:14:30.385 --> 00:14:31.435
else out of it.

281
00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.835
And the next thing we know we're looking at,

282
00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:36.155
at each other very differently.

283
00:14:36.765 --> 00:14:38.075
We're seeing each other differently.

284
00:14:38.365 --> 00:14:40.235
We're we're looking, not so much

285
00:14:40.805 --> 00:14:43.315
stuck on looking at the behavior of the other person,

286
00:14:43.455 --> 00:14:45.315
but looking at the heart of the other person.

287
00:14:45.695 --> 00:14:47.635
And that was a big shift for us,

288
00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:49.795
as it is for a lot of people.

289
00:14:51.025 --> 00:14:52.045
So I wanna read a quote

290
00:14:52.345 --> 00:14:54.645
that's actually in the guide for this course.

291
00:14:56.025 --> 00:14:58.205
It says this, we can share the same address,

292
00:14:58.745 --> 00:15:01.565
the same dinner table, and even the same bed,

293
00:15:02.265 --> 00:15:04.685
and still feel disconnected from one another.

294
00:15:05.585 --> 00:15:07.405
We can live together for decades

295
00:15:08.305 --> 00:15:13.205
and yet still feel distant and isolated in marriage.

296
00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:17.415
We've all had times in our relationships when we felt like

297
00:15:17.415 --> 00:15:19.415
our spouse didn't really know us

298
00:15:20.355 --> 00:15:23.855
or wasn't able to care for us in ways that were meaningful.

299
00:15:26.155 --> 00:15:29.135
See Joyce, and I like to say that we don't have

300
00:15:29.135 --> 00:15:32.335
to go back more than about 48 hours to have another

301
00:15:32.855 --> 00:15:37.655
testimony from the trenches of how we messed up just

302
00:15:37.655 --> 00:15:39.575
with being short, being impatient.

303
00:15:40.465 --> 00:15:42.095
Folks, I'd like to tell you that when you get

304
00:15:42.095 --> 00:15:43.655
to our age, that doesn't happen.

305
00:15:44.595 --> 00:15:46.935
It does. It sure does.

306
00:15:47.675 --> 00:15:50.255
And, uh, it's kind of a constant, okay, Lord,

307
00:15:51.515 --> 00:15:54.445
take a deep breath, show me your grace.

308
00:15:54.915 --> 00:15:56.205
Help me pass it on.

309
00:15:57.705 --> 00:16:01.325
But that is actually

310
00:16:01.435 --> 00:16:03.125
what good marriages look like.

311
00:16:03.515 --> 00:16:05.565
They do stumble, they do have problems.

312
00:16:05.565 --> 00:16:07.605
They do have disconnects.

313
00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:09.925
They do say things like,

314
00:16:10.185 --> 00:16:13.485
pastor John in our church here was speaking about today.

315
00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:17.565
We, we do have to go back and ask for forgiveness

316
00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:19.445
and, uh, make things right.

317
00:16:20.785 --> 00:16:24.045
So success is not no conflict.

318
00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:27.585
Successes, having the tools and the grace

319
00:16:27.765 --> 00:16:31.865
and the humility to resolve conflict and to repair things.

320
00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:36.265
So there's a biblical account of this.

321
00:16:36.365 --> 00:16:38.265
And I may have shared part of this in that workshop,

322
00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:39.425
but not everybody was there.

323
00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:45.065
I want you to think about the first human created.

324
00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:48.455
His name was Adam.

325
00:16:50.395 --> 00:16:51.815
And he's sitting in the Garden

326
00:16:51.835 --> 00:16:54.455
of Eden having been created by God.

327
00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:58.615
And, uh, he's even got a, uh,

328
00:16:59.725 --> 00:17:03.415
perfectly controlled temper, uh, environment.

329
00:17:04.865 --> 00:17:09.205
How do I know that? 'cause he's naked. Okay, read the text.

330
00:17:09.485 --> 00:17:13.685
I didn't make that up. Um, perfectly controlled environment.

331
00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:15.205
He's got everything he needs.

332
00:17:16.025 --> 00:17:17.765
He possesses everything he needs,

333
00:17:18.065 --> 00:17:21.685
and he's in an exalted position relative

334
00:17:21.685 --> 00:17:23.245
to the animals that are already there.

335
00:17:23.465 --> 00:17:25.485
He gets to name 'em among other things.

336
00:17:27.225 --> 00:17:30.685
But in the midst of being in that perfect garden of Eden

337
00:17:33.955 --> 00:17:36.645
with the perfect relationship with his creator,

338
00:17:37.275 --> 00:17:39.205
there's no sin in the world here.

339
00:17:40.785 --> 00:17:42.005
That's when God shows up

340
00:17:42.005 --> 00:17:45.405
and says, Adam, dude, Houston, we got a problem.

341
00:17:46.795 --> 00:17:49.685
Something's not good. And there's no sin in the world.

342
00:17:50.705 --> 00:17:53.075
It's not good because God hasn't quite finished

343
00:17:53.215 --> 00:17:54.275
his creative work.

344
00:17:54.535 --> 00:17:59.375
And he wired Adam to need not only him God,

345
00:18:00.115 --> 00:18:01.855
but also other humans.

346
00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.215
He wired him that way. If you have a problem with

347
00:18:05.215 --> 00:18:06.695
that, take it up with God.

348
00:18:06.965 --> 00:18:09.335
That was his sovereign will to do it that way.

349
00:18:09.845 --> 00:18:12.055
Instead of popping people into existence

350
00:18:12.635 --> 00:18:15.455
as independent little robots that just run around

351
00:18:15.455 --> 00:18:19.095
and do things, he created Adam

352
00:18:20.205 --> 00:18:21.495
with a God shaped vacuum.

353
00:18:22.955 --> 00:18:24.695
The that was already connected,

354
00:18:26.275 --> 00:18:30.055
but he also created him with the need to connect on a deep,

355
00:18:30.055 --> 00:18:32.575
meaningful level with other humans.

356
00:18:33.555 --> 00:18:38.495
And the first provision that God makes for Adam is Eve,

357
00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:43.615
who is like him being a human being, needing

358
00:18:43.615 --> 00:18:44.935
to breathe air and sleep

359
00:18:44.995 --> 00:18:47.255
and do all those things that human beings need.

360
00:18:47.675 --> 00:18:52.335
But he also created Eve in a different gender.

361
00:18:53.685 --> 00:18:55.855
That was part of his plan, okay?

362
00:18:56.595 --> 00:18:58.095
And that's where we point

363
00:18:58.095 --> 00:18:59.655
and say, that's where marriage began.

364
00:19:00.165 --> 00:19:03.255
That was the institution of marriage being set up

365
00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:05.455
by God when he creates Eve.

366
00:19:05.835 --> 00:19:09.175
So Adam had a perfect relationship with God,

367
00:19:09.195 --> 00:19:11.455
but he didn't have a relationship with another human.

368
00:19:12.075 --> 00:19:13.815
Eve gets created, she comes into the world

369
00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:15.495
with a perfect relationship with God

370
00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:18.215
and a connection to Adam,

371
00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:23.255
other provisions of God that can remove aloneness,

372
00:19:23.885 --> 00:19:26.895
that can provide connection, include our families.

373
00:19:28.365 --> 00:19:29.975
I've got a brother that lives here in town,

374
00:19:31.005 --> 00:19:32.095
very close to my brother.

375
00:19:33.195 --> 00:19:36.055
That's another connection that he and I can sit

376
00:19:36.055 --> 00:19:37.135
and talk about things,

377
00:19:37.365 --> 00:19:40.055
whether they're superficial things like football

378
00:19:40.475 --> 00:19:43.975
or there are deep things about, you know, uh,

379
00:19:43.995 --> 00:19:46.695
we were talking the other day about, uh, my mom

380
00:19:47.315 --> 00:19:48.335
and she's long gone,

381
00:19:48.515 --> 00:19:50.855
but we were having a really neat conversation about her.

382
00:19:52.595 --> 00:19:54.095
So family's another provision.

383
00:19:54.095 --> 00:19:55.855
Third provision would be the church.

384
00:19:57.675 --> 00:20:00.575
You see, the church that is the body of believers,

385
00:20:00.855 --> 00:20:02.895
regardless of what building they might meet in

386
00:20:02.955 --> 00:20:05.855
or what they call themselves, if they believe in Christ,

387
00:20:06.725 --> 00:20:09.175
that body of believers is actually equipped

388
00:20:09.555 --> 00:20:11.535
to remove aloneness for one another.

389
00:20:12.195 --> 00:20:15.175
Though many of us for many years, we're not

390
00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:18.935
Aware of how to do that.

391
00:20:20.425 --> 00:20:22.565
We had not been fully equipped,

392
00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:25.005
we had been given the capacity for it.

393
00:20:26.265 --> 00:20:29.645
And that's what our testimony included last week was 19

394
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:30.925
years before we knew how

395
00:20:30.925 --> 00:20:32.325
to connect on a heart to heart level.

396
00:20:34.405 --> 00:20:36.865
So alone, this is removed

397
00:20:37.525 --> 00:20:41.505
or can be removed through any of those, uh, provisions,

398
00:20:42.565 --> 00:20:46.145
um, I wanna show you, uh, that's the biblical support

399
00:20:46.325 --> 00:20:50.565
for the need for connection, the need for relationship

400
00:20:51.115 --> 00:20:52.765
that goes beneath the surface

401
00:20:54.315 --> 00:20:56.165
with at least some of the people in your life.

402
00:20:57.115 --> 00:21:00.565
There's also scientific evidence that this is true.

403
00:21:01.105 --> 00:21:03.565
And I wanna show you a video of that.

404
00:21:05.725 --> 00:21:08.485
I did not show this one in the, um,

405
00:21:11.795 --> 00:21:13.565
come on, I gotta get out.

406
00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:18.515
Before I was in, I didn't show this video

407
00:21:18.655 --> 00:21:19.755
in the workshop I did,

408
00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:22.755
although many of you have already seen it, I'm sure.

409
00:21:24.015 --> 00:21:26.275
But in three minutes it kind of shows

410
00:21:26.425 --> 00:21:29.915
what would take 30 minutes to an hour to really explain.

411
00:21:30.785 --> 00:21:33.115
This is called the still Face Experiment.

412
00:21:34.935 --> 00:21:39.155
Um, I saw this first about nine or 10 years ago, uh,

413
00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:42.475
because I was at a training conference for a counseling

414
00:21:43.205 --> 00:21:47.355
model that was developed by non-believers.

415
00:21:47.495 --> 00:21:49.355
But it's sound, it's a good model.

416
00:21:49.505 --> 00:21:51.835
It's just the person that developed it was,

417
00:21:52.415 --> 00:21:53.835
um, not a believer.

418
00:21:54.655 --> 00:21:59.075
Um, later on she actually co-wrote a book

419
00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:00.675
with the believer to say,

420
00:22:00.675 --> 00:22:02.955
here's the Christian version of this model.

421
00:22:03.575 --> 00:22:07.115
So she's at least not close-minded to us Christians.

422
00:22:07.935 --> 00:22:11.515
But, um, they showed this as a way to help us see

423
00:22:12.625 --> 00:22:15.355
what can we learn from a, an infant

424
00:22:16.135 --> 00:22:18.075
who isn't even old enough to speak yet.

425
00:22:19.185 --> 00:22:21.875
What can we learn about human nature from an infant?

426
00:22:21.935 --> 00:22:23.595
So let's see if this plays. Well,

427
00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:29.555
Babies this young are extremely responsive

428
00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:33.115
to the emotions and the reactivity

429
00:22:33.255 --> 00:22:34.555
and the social interaction

430
00:22:34.825 --> 00:22:37.715
that they get from the world around them.

431
00:22:37.985 --> 00:22:40.235
This is something that we started studying

432
00:22:41.135 --> 00:22:44.675
oh 34 years ago when people didn't think

433
00:22:45.105 --> 00:22:48.835
that infants could engage in social interaction.

434
00:22:49.775 --> 00:22:51.315
And the still face experiment.

435
00:22:51.315 --> 00:22:52.995
What the mother did was she sits down

436
00:22:53.055 --> 00:22:56.315
and she's playing with her baby, who's about a year of age

437
00:22:57.145 --> 00:22:58.145
Like girl.

438
00:22:59.175 --> 00:23:01.875
Oh. And she gives a greeting to the baby.

439
00:23:02.095 --> 00:23:04.155
The baby gives a greeting back to her.

440
00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:08.475
This baby starts pointing at different places in the world

441
00:23:08.615 --> 00:23:11.195
and the mother's trying to engage her and play with her.

442
00:23:11.225 --> 00:23:15.835
They're working to coordinate her emotions

443
00:23:16.415 --> 00:23:18.275
and their intentions, what they want

444
00:23:18.275 --> 00:23:20.235
to do in the world. And that's,

445
00:23:21.135 --> 00:23:22.995
Uh, what you've just witnessed there.

446
00:23:23.345 --> 00:23:24.475
It's so common, isn't it?

447
00:23:24.585 --> 00:23:25.715
Even if you see a baby

448
00:23:25.715 --> 00:23:27.835
that's not yours may not even be related to you,

449
00:23:28.415 --> 00:23:29.635
but you see 'em in a restaurant

450
00:23:29.695 --> 00:23:31.115
or something, they make eyes at you.

451
00:23:31.135 --> 00:23:33.275
And the next thing you do, you gotta smile here

452
00:23:33.275 --> 00:23:34.475
or here, right?

453
00:23:35.145 --> 00:23:37.795
There's actually part of your brain that's designed to cause

454
00:23:37.795 --> 00:23:40.555
that to happen called mirror neurons.

455
00:23:41.065 --> 00:23:43.635
It's hard to say the word mirror, but that's what they are.

456
00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:47.085
And they help us connect for people.

457
00:23:47.815 --> 00:23:50.645
Again, fearfully and wonderfully made.

458
00:23:50.645 --> 00:23:53.845
Your brain is we're just now discovering

459
00:23:53.845 --> 00:23:55.445
and understanding more and more about it.

460
00:23:56.505 --> 00:23:58.405
So that, that's just happened.

461
00:23:58.485 --> 00:24:01.845
I would call brain food for an infant.

462
00:24:03.075 --> 00:24:04.885
They can't tell what those words mean,

463
00:24:05.705 --> 00:24:08.245
but when they see that smiling face that seems

464
00:24:08.345 --> 00:24:12.805
to be expressing delight, I promise you

465
00:24:13.355 --> 00:24:17.325
that is helping that child develop relationally as well

466
00:24:17.325 --> 00:24:20.845
as can be done at that age when their needs are met.

467
00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:23.085
But not only the need for food

468
00:24:23.185 --> 00:24:25.405
and to have your diaper changed and that kind of stuff,

469
00:24:25.405 --> 00:24:27.645
but when their connection need is met,

470
00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:31.885
it's reinforcing a sense of security in this child.

471
00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:36.605
Somebody loves me even though she doesn't have that ability

472
00:24:36.605 --> 00:24:40.645
to think in words yet, but it's giving her a secure

473
00:24:40.945 --> 00:24:45.685
and safe place to be with someone.

474
00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:48.325
Okay? That's the way it's supposed to happen.

475
00:24:49.065 --> 00:24:51.365
And it's supposed to continue that way through life.

476
00:24:53.695 --> 00:24:57.555
Now, when you get to be 17, 18, roughly, you know that age,

477
00:24:58.095 --> 00:25:00.035
you ought to be learning how to give that

478
00:25:00.035 --> 00:25:01.715
to other people by then, right?

479
00:25:02.415 --> 00:25:04.315
That's where you develop the ability.

480
00:25:04.655 --> 00:25:08.835
But your ability to give it to others is best

481
00:25:09.755 --> 00:25:14.395
accomplished if you received it growing up consistently

482
00:25:14.615 --> 00:25:16.715
and abundantly, if not perfectly.

483
00:25:17.065 --> 00:25:20.995
Okay? Now let's see what they have her do that's different.

484
00:25:20.995 --> 00:25:23.515
This is really what the baby is used to.

485
00:25:23.895 --> 00:25:28.595
And then we ask the mother to not respond to the baby.

486
00:25:32.055 --> 00:25:34.875
The baby very quickly picks up on this.

487
00:25:35.255 --> 00:25:38.035
And then she uses all of her abilities

488
00:25:38.615 --> 00:25:40.275
to try and get the mother back.

489
00:25:41.055 --> 00:25:45.115
She smiles at the mother, she points

490
00:25:45.115 --> 00:25:48.275
because she's used to the mother looking where she points

491
00:25:50.895 --> 00:25:54.315
the baby puts both hands up in front of her

492
00:25:54.495 --> 00:25:57.115
and says, what's happening

493
00:25:57.225 --> 00:25:58.225
Here?

494
00:25:59.215 --> 00:26:03.195
She makes that screechy sound at the mother.

495
00:26:03.705 --> 00:26:06.795
Like, come on, why aren't we doing this?

496
00:26:08.145 --> 00:26:11.915
Even in this two minutes, when they don't get the normal

497
00:26:12.515 --> 00:26:16.395
reaction, they react negative emotions, they turn away,

498
00:26:16.665 --> 00:26:18.395
they feel the stress of it.

499
00:26:18.585 --> 00:26:21.195
They actually may lose control of their posture

500
00:26:21.755 --> 00:26:23.915
'cause of the stress that they're experiencing.

501
00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:30.875
I'll rescue you, all of you moms who are about

502
00:26:30.875 --> 00:26:31.875
To come. And

503
00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:32.275

504
00:26:33.265 --> 00:26:34.355
Even some of those guys,

505
00:26:37.345 --> 00:26:38.675
there's another piece to this.

506
00:26:38.855 --> 00:26:41.725
But if you saw a baby

507
00:26:43.725 --> 00:26:47.845
squirming crying, maybe even wailing

508
00:26:47.865 --> 00:26:51.125
or screeching in a grocery store,

509
00:26:52.905 --> 00:26:55.085
see, if we don't see people the way God sees 'em,

510
00:26:55.085 --> 00:26:57.885
we might think as, I think my mom told me,

511
00:26:58.745 --> 00:27:00.125
that's a fussy baby.

512
00:27:00.215 --> 00:27:04.125
Don't be like that. And my mom was not a bad woman,

513
00:27:05.505 --> 00:27:08.845
but she was really in, it was real important for her

514
00:27:08.945 --> 00:27:13.765
to have us not be disrupting, what did he call it?

515
00:27:13.915 --> 00:27:16.485
Instead of a character flaw in a baby

516
00:27:16.545 --> 00:27:19.365
or immaturity in a baby for 1-year-old.

517
00:27:19.625 --> 00:27:21.805
And what, what's immaturity to a wonder?

518
00:27:23.155 --> 00:27:25.605
Instead of him labeling it immaturity

519
00:27:25.825 --> 00:27:27.965
or a character flock, what did he call it?

520
00:27:29.065 --> 00:27:31.605
Did you catch it? He said,

521
00:27:31.605 --> 00:27:34.205
this baby is distressed.

522
00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:41.605
You see, that's the natural brain reaction function.

523
00:27:42.115 --> 00:27:44.165
When it, when the brain's doing what it's supposed to do,

524
00:27:44.635 --> 00:27:47.565
it's saying, okay, we have had this safe connection

525
00:27:47.565 --> 00:27:49.485
to this mom for a whole year.

526
00:27:50.225 --> 00:27:51.525
Now she's disappeared.

527
00:27:52.565 --> 00:27:54.145
Now she's right there in front of her. Right?

528
00:27:55.045 --> 00:27:57.225
But you see what I mean? She's disappeared,

529
00:27:59.355 --> 00:28:00.665
she's quick connecting.

530
00:28:01.905 --> 00:28:04.545
Whatever I do seems to be invisible.

531
00:28:06.525 --> 00:28:09.065
And that's why she goes through a sequence

532
00:28:09.085 --> 00:28:10.465
of things that come to her mind.

533
00:28:10.825 --> 00:28:12.265
I think I'll get her attention this way.

534
00:28:12.265 --> 00:28:15.065
Well, that didn't work. I think I'll smile and charm.

535
00:28:15.525 --> 00:28:18.785
No, that didn't work. I want to get away from this.

536
00:28:19.225 --> 00:28:22.025
I look away. That didn't seem to bring mom back.

537
00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:24.665
It might have reduced the tension slightly,

538
00:28:24.765 --> 00:28:26.105
but it didn't bring mom back.

539
00:28:28.855 --> 00:28:30.625
That is natural.

540
00:28:32.445 --> 00:28:34.345
God ordained, pre-wired, wired,

541
00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:38.465
self preservation activity showing up in a 1-year-old.

542
00:28:40.845 --> 00:28:43.945
And guess what folks? We do adult, adult versions of

543
00:28:43.945 --> 00:28:47.585
that sometimes when we don't feel seen or heard

544
00:28:48.605 --> 00:28:50.465
or cared for, join the club.

545
00:28:54.815 --> 00:28:55.105
Okay,

546
00:28:59.645 --> 00:29:03.945
I'm here and whatcha doing? Oh,

547
00:29:04.195 --> 00:29:05.195
She's bad.

548
00:29:07.135 --> 00:29:09.705
It's a little like the good, the bad and the ugly.

549
00:29:10.565 --> 00:29:15.385
The good is that normal stuff that goes on

550
00:29:15.385 --> 00:29:17.025
that we all do with our kids.

551
00:29:17.925 --> 00:29:21.945
The bad is when something bad happens,

552
00:29:22.245 --> 00:29:23.905
but the infant can overcome it.

553
00:29:23.905 --> 00:29:26.625
After all, when you stop the still face, the mother

554
00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:28.385
and the baby start to play again.

555
00:29:29.045 --> 00:29:33.065
The ugly is when you don't give the child any chance

556
00:29:33.685 --> 00:29:37.865
to get back to the good, there's no reparation

557
00:29:38.005 --> 00:29:40.265
and they're stuck in that really

558
00:29:40.695 --> 00:29:41.765
Ugly situation.

559
00:29:45.745 --> 00:29:50.205
Any reactions to that? Thoughts? Reflections?

560
00:29:51.675 --> 00:29:55.005
Come on, y'all. Remove my aloneness up here.

561
00:29:57.915 --> 00:29:58.915
What do you think?

562
00:30:01.805 --> 00:30:04.405
I can see how it reflects that, you know, my relationship

563
00:30:04.405 --> 00:30:08.645
with my wife where I don't respond when she's asking her.

564
00:30:08.955 --> 00:30:11.005
Yeah. Jillian, thank you so much

565
00:30:11.065 --> 00:30:12.725
for being transparent about that.

566
00:30:13.265 --> 00:30:16.205
Um, we, I bet you most of us, me

567
00:30:16.205 --> 00:30:18.565
and if not all of us, could say something similar,

568
00:30:19.505 --> 00:30:22.645
but that's a great application to pull out from that.

569
00:30:23.465 --> 00:30:24.845
See how that might be.

570
00:30:26.635 --> 00:30:29.485
Part of what's needed in my spouse

571
00:30:31.425 --> 00:30:32.885
is more responsiveness.

572
00:30:34.395 --> 00:30:37.205
Okay? And there could be things in

573
00:30:39.345 --> 00:30:41.685
the hearts of those of us who aren't being responsive.

574
00:30:41.685 --> 00:30:44.645
That kind of help would help us understand why we're

575
00:30:44.645 --> 00:30:45.805
not more responsive.

576
00:30:46.785 --> 00:30:50.125
But we don't want to use those reasons as excuses.

577
00:30:50.305 --> 00:30:54.925
We just want to understand what's getting in my way. Okay.

578
00:30:55.665 --> 00:30:59.805
And do it nonjudgmentally. How can I get better?

579
00:31:02.165 --> 00:31:05.695
Somebody else? Thoughts

580
00:31:05.695 --> 00:31:08.055
or reflections? Yeah.

581
00:31:08.415 --> 00:31:09.855
I grew up in an alcoholic home

582
00:31:10.195 --> 00:31:14.135
and I don't think I learned some of the connection skills.

583
00:31:14.715 --> 00:31:19.495
And so even a

584
00:31:19.495 --> 00:31:23.255
conversation my wife and I had tonight was about this area

585
00:31:23.355 --> 00:31:25.695
of our relationship and the ability to connect.

586
00:31:25.835 --> 00:31:29.735
And, um, it's just, uh, recognizing

587
00:31:29.735 --> 00:31:31.295
that it's not there is one thing.

588
00:31:31.325 --> 00:31:33.775
It's another thing to recognize how to,

589
00:31:34.795 --> 00:31:38.065
Um, Have that tool that you mentioned Yeah.

590
00:31:38.255 --> 00:31:41.345
That I've never, ever received. So

591
00:31:42.535 --> 00:31:43.535
That'd be a shame.

592
00:31:43.565 --> 00:31:45.275
Thank you for sharing that. By the way.

593
00:31:45.585 --> 00:31:49.875
It'd be a shame if we were more aware there's a problem,

594
00:31:51.625 --> 00:31:55.125
but didn't have a tool or a way to get better.

595
00:31:56.835 --> 00:31:58.525
It'd be like just expecting that,

596
00:32:00.355 --> 00:32:02.645
that basketball team to go back out there

597
00:32:02.645 --> 00:32:04.645
and get better without showing 'em how.

598
00:32:05.945 --> 00:32:10.005
So we definitely want to have these tools to work from

599
00:32:10.145 --> 00:32:12.245
and we'll, we'll be building those in.

600
00:32:13.135 --> 00:32:16.565
Sorry Jason. So sorry to hear that happen to you

601
00:32:16.625 --> 00:32:18.245
as a boy. Yeah,

602
00:32:19.045 --> 00:32:20.205
I was gonna add that, that,

603
00:32:20.385 --> 00:32:22.405
and then that was reinforced as an adult.

604
00:32:22.725 --> 00:32:24.165
'cause I work in the construction ministry

605
00:32:24.225 --> 00:32:27.565
and I learned about the, well, I started working at the age

606
00:32:27.565 --> 00:32:29.565
of 11 from heavy equipment

607
00:32:29.745 --> 00:32:32.925
and I learned don't bring your feelings to work.

608
00:32:33.275 --> 00:32:35.845
Yeah. And so, which is one thing for work,

609
00:32:35.985 --> 00:32:37.645
but then you go home at the end of the day.

610
00:32:38.745 --> 00:32:40.965
And so it doesn't,

611
00:32:40.995 --> 00:32:43.805
that doesn't work real well. So,

612
00:32:44.705 --> 00:32:46.765
You know, that's a great example by the way.

613
00:32:47.305 --> 00:32:51.965
Uh, in homes where there's alcoholism present

614
00:32:51.965 --> 00:32:55.765
that is one, or both parents are, um,

615
00:32:56.435 --> 00:32:59.925
alcoholic dependent on alcohol drinking frequently

616
00:33:00.305 --> 00:33:02.085
or that whole thing,

617
00:33:02.985 --> 00:33:05.925
rarely can they meet the emotional needs of the children.

618
00:33:07.705 --> 00:33:08.725
That's almost a given.

619
00:33:09.795 --> 00:33:11.885
Well, if the emotional needs of the child aren't met,

620
00:33:11.885 --> 00:33:14.765
that means there isn't that safe haven.

621
00:33:15.905 --> 00:33:17.405
At least not consistently.

622
00:33:18.785 --> 00:33:22.445
And when he said, what if the child gets,

623
00:33:22.745 --> 00:33:26.605
or what if the, there's no recovery for the child,

624
00:33:28.265 --> 00:33:31.525
that's the ugly where they don't get repair.

625
00:33:32.945 --> 00:33:35.925
So just imagine if the, if the family system

626
00:33:36.585 --> 00:33:38.645
either had something like alcoholism

627
00:33:38.645 --> 00:33:40.885
that was getting in the way and causing problems

628
00:33:41.305 --> 00:33:44.965
or just, um, extreme neglect, uh,

629
00:33:45.385 --> 00:33:50.045
or too busy on various levels,

630
00:33:50.305 --> 00:33:52.885
the child's not necessarily getting everything they need.

631
00:33:53.875 --> 00:33:56.525
Okay? And yet most of us in this room

632
00:33:57.085 --> 00:33:59.045
probably didn't get everything we needed

633
00:33:59.545 --> 00:34:02.285
and we're still recovering and growing.

634
00:34:02.505 --> 00:34:05.885
And like me came to know the Lord as an adult,

635
00:34:05.885 --> 00:34:07.125
that helped tremendously.

636
00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:09.685
But there was still a lot of healing and repair to be done.

637
00:34:10.225 --> 00:34:12.005
So those are great examples.

638
00:34:12.905 --> 00:34:17.645
Um, the thing that removes aloneness

639
00:34:18.115 --> 00:34:21.645
that we can begin to use or apply more

640
00:34:21.705 --> 00:34:24.885
and more consistency consistently is

641
00:34:24.885 --> 00:34:26.725
what the Bible calls intimacy.

642
00:34:27.825 --> 00:34:30.285
Now when I mention the word intimacy

643
00:34:30.505 --> 00:34:34.085
or intimate, what's the first word

644
00:34:34.115 --> 00:34:35.365
that comes up in your mind?

645
00:34:36.315 --> 00:34:41.045
Come on, somebody's saying success. Now.

646
00:34:41.675 --> 00:34:44.005
It's one reason why some of us suggested to Dr.

647
00:34:44.465 --> 00:34:47.205
We should probably rename the counseling model.

648
00:34:47.275 --> 00:34:49.205
Instead of calling it intimacy therapy.

649
00:34:49.345 --> 00:34:50.485
We ought to call it something else.

650
00:34:50.745 --> 00:34:52.485
And he said, Nope, I'm sticking with that word.

651
00:34:52.555 --> 00:34:55.245
It's God's word and we are claiming it. Okay?

652
00:34:55.985 --> 00:34:57.685
But I'm gonna pass this around.

653
00:34:57.685 --> 00:35:00.365
There's enough for one per couple. Okay?

654
00:35:00.675 --> 00:35:05.085
This is a definition out of, uh, the Britannica of what they

655
00:35:05.805 --> 00:35:07.205
describe as intimacy.

656
00:35:07.465 --> 00:35:10.645
And I need one copy of that, Chuck. Thank you.

657
00:35:12.165 --> 00:35:13.565
I can't remember what it says before.

658
00:35:14.905 --> 00:35:18.285
Um, here's what the Britannica a secular

659
00:35:19.315 --> 00:35:20.365
publication says.

660
00:35:22.025 --> 00:35:23.845
But you'll have the whole thing to take home

661
00:35:23.865 --> 00:35:25.485
and read later if you want to you.

662
00:35:26.865 --> 00:35:29.965
It says, intimacy is a state of being intimate,

663
00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:34.365
which is marked by consensual sharing.

664
00:35:34.625 --> 00:35:37.485
Notice that consensual, that means not forced,

665
00:35:38.705 --> 00:35:42.525
not demanded consensual sharing of deeply

666
00:35:43.165 --> 00:35:44.285
personal information.

667
00:35:46.145 --> 00:35:49.485
It has cognitive, effective and behavioral components.

668
00:35:50.155 --> 00:35:53.965
That is my body language actually helps communicate.

669
00:35:54.305 --> 00:35:55.965
Am I being transparent

670
00:35:56.785 --> 00:36:00.645
and am I being vulnerable when I share something

671
00:36:00.645 --> 00:36:01.845
really personal about me?

672
00:36:03.185 --> 00:36:04.645
Or am I just raising my voice

673
00:36:04.745 --> 00:36:06.325
as I've been guilty of so many times?

674
00:36:07.905 --> 00:36:11.965
Now it's, it's more of how can we share

675
00:36:12.035 --> 00:36:13.725
what really matters to us?

676
00:36:13.745 --> 00:36:16.845
That's deep intimates.

677
00:36:16.845 --> 00:36:20.045
Or people who are being intimate relationally reveal

678
00:36:20.045 --> 00:36:21.365
themselves to one another.

679
00:36:21.995 --> 00:36:24.005
They care deeply about one another

680
00:36:24.505 --> 00:36:27.485
and they are comfortable in close proximity.

681
00:36:30.175 --> 00:36:35.165
Lemme give you an example of two warriors in the Bible.

682
00:36:36.725 --> 00:36:38.885
Somebody, some of you may already know who I'm thinking of

683
00:36:39.625 --> 00:36:40.685
in the Old Testament.

684
00:36:41.155 --> 00:36:44.965
There's some, many, many chapters about these two guys.

685
00:36:46.145 --> 00:36:49.405
One was King David, who's the other one? Jonathan. Jonathan.

686
00:36:49.805 --> 00:36:53.765
Jonathan. Jonathan was the son of who? Saul King. King Sa.

687
00:36:53.875 --> 00:36:57.445
King Saul. So King Saul was in authority.

688
00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:59.205
And then here comes King David.

689
00:36:59.265 --> 00:37:03.725
And God picks King David, who's gonna be the next rule.

690
00:37:04.675 --> 00:37:06.925
Saul doesn't like that. So he starts trying to,

691
00:37:08.425 --> 00:37:11.405
he see King David's getting popular with the people.

692
00:37:12.185 --> 00:37:15.685
So he starts to chase after him, even intending to kill him.

693
00:37:17.085 --> 00:37:20.925
Jonathan Saul's son goes so far as to warn David

694
00:37:21.885 --> 00:37:24.965
multiple times and save his life or help help him.

695
00:37:26.025 --> 00:37:29.445
But there's an interesting reference to their relationship.

696
00:37:31.845 --> 00:37:34.705
It says they were knit together in the soul.

697
00:37:37.105 --> 00:37:39.665
I think you could use foxhole buddy as an analogy.

698
00:37:40.795 --> 00:37:45.705
These guys fought wars together. They are men's men.

699
00:37:46.525 --> 00:37:48.265
If we want to use that kind of a label,

700
00:37:48.535 --> 00:37:49.905
they probably qualified,

701
00:37:50.045 --> 00:37:53.625
but they have this deep, caring, connected relationship

702
00:37:53.835 --> 00:37:56.945
where I think it's safe to say they had each other's backs.

703
00:37:56.945 --> 00:37:58.025
They would die for each other.

704
00:38:00.405 --> 00:38:04.185
So when it comes to us men being relationally intimate,

705
00:38:05.255 --> 00:38:07.305
sharing our deep thoughts

706
00:38:07.325 --> 00:38:10.105
and feelings, you got some pretty good

707
00:38:10.105 --> 00:38:11.345
examples to follow there.

708
00:38:12.055 --> 00:38:14.185
Does that make sense? It is a myth

709
00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:16.665
that says men don't have feelings.

710
00:38:18.005 --> 00:38:19.465
We just express them differently.

711
00:38:19.605 --> 00:38:23.945
In many ways, men are often referred to

712
00:38:23.965 --> 00:38:25.065
as having passion,

713
00:38:25.725 --> 00:38:27.945
not just in a sexual way, but in other ways.

714
00:38:28.885 --> 00:38:31.105
And I would say, well, so do women.

715
00:38:31.805 --> 00:38:35.965
But that's evidence of there's a motion that can be very

716
00:38:36.565 --> 00:38:40.165
powerful and strong even when it's being used

717
00:38:40.265 --> 00:38:41.405
for nothing but good.

718
00:38:43.145 --> 00:38:46.285
So we can embrace this idea of

719
00:38:47.535 --> 00:38:49.245
being relationally intimate.

720
00:38:52.145 --> 00:38:54.525
Um, God's provision for, I,

721
00:38:55.545 --> 00:38:57.525
I'm sorry, I'm reminded of the part,

722
00:38:57.755 --> 00:39:00.805
something I read in chapter one that said, I mean,

723
00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:02.725
it's not just laying in bed talking about

724
00:39:02.725 --> 00:39:03.765
what groceries you need

725
00:39:03.765 --> 00:39:06.125
to buy when you need to mow the yard.

726
00:39:06.715 --> 00:39:09.005
Yeah. Those aren't intimate conversations.

727
00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:11.405
No. And, and yet they're necessary conversations.

728
00:39:11.405 --> 00:39:14.405
Aren't they made a grocery list before we came here tonight?

729
00:39:14.935 --> 00:39:18.845
Guess where we're going? But that's not intimacy.

730
00:39:21.555 --> 00:39:24.375
If you grew up in an environment where that mother

731
00:39:25.075 --> 00:39:28.175
and that dad stayed connected to you

732
00:39:28.435 --> 00:39:31.855
and made it okay for you to even complain

733
00:39:32.585 --> 00:39:35.055
until we found out what's really going on

734
00:39:35.085 --> 00:39:39.175
with this complaint, I don't like Susie anymore.

735
00:39:39.605 --> 00:39:43.095
Well, it could be Susie's said something to her.

736
00:39:44.295 --> 00:39:46.495
Whatever it is. If you grew up in that kind of environment,

737
00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:52.335
then superficial conversation may be about as good

738
00:39:52.335 --> 00:39:56.135
as you can get because you're just not yet safe

739
00:39:56.595 --> 00:39:59.255
or equipped or a combination of the two.

740
00:39:59.825 --> 00:40:01.895
Those are two fixable problems.

741
00:40:03.495 --> 00:40:07.795
Creating safety and showing you how

742
00:40:07.795 --> 00:40:10.475
to communicate when it's talking about

743
00:40:10.475 --> 00:40:11.715
feelings and stuff like that.

744
00:40:13.015 --> 00:40:14.835
So the antidote

745
00:40:14.895 --> 00:40:18.675
for aloneness is intimacy on a relational level,

746
00:40:18.845 --> 00:40:20.715
which could be applied in a friendship.

747
00:40:21.545 --> 00:40:23.155
Okay? Could be applied to workers.

748
00:40:23.835 --> 00:40:25.955
Somebody mentioned a business where, uh, that was,

749
00:40:26.755 --> 00:40:29.715
I think you, uh, Jason, uh, where

750
00:40:30.505 --> 00:40:33.435
they basically told us stuff it there too, right?

751
00:40:34.185 --> 00:40:37.035
There's a company called McCoy's Building Supply.

752
00:40:37.295 --> 00:40:40.475
So lumberyard company in Texas has about a hundred stores,

753
00:40:41.135 --> 00:40:42.395
uh, primarily in Texas.

754
00:40:43.575 --> 00:40:46.155
The head of that company about 20 years ago,

755
00:40:46.155 --> 00:40:49.075
started having us teach these principles

756
00:40:49.535 --> 00:40:51.155
to his leadership,

757
00:40:53.335 --> 00:40:54.615
stripping out the Bible verses.

758
00:40:54.775 --> 00:40:57.215
'cause he didn't want to impose his faith on them.

759
00:40:57.915 --> 00:41:00.015
But if anybody asked, where'd you get these ideas?

760
00:41:00.515 --> 00:41:02.415
We didn't hesitate to tell 'em, write out

761
00:41:02.415 --> 00:41:03.455
that black book right there.

762
00:41:04.365 --> 00:41:07.575
Okay? And in that, those companies,

763
00:41:09.385 --> 00:41:13.055
leadership is expected to be able to listen

764
00:41:13.715 --> 00:41:18.415
at a deep level to try to help their employees.

765
00:41:20.795 --> 00:41:24.255
So if you look in the Bible for where are there words

766
00:41:24.325 --> 00:41:26.855
that help us see what's intimacy look like?

767
00:41:26.915 --> 00:41:30.535
You'll find three Hebrew words in the Old Testament

768
00:41:30.535 --> 00:41:32.055
that start to shed light on that.

769
00:41:32.555 --> 00:41:35.365
One is yaah, which means to know deeply.

770
00:41:36.835 --> 00:41:38.725
Another is sowed,

771
00:41:45.775 --> 00:41:49.245
which means to reveal or to disclose.

772
00:41:50.345 --> 00:41:52.285
So this means deep knowing.

773
00:41:57.555 --> 00:41:59.005
This means to reveal.

774
00:42:02.425 --> 00:42:06.925
And the third Hebrew word that's translated intimacy is

775
00:42:07.565 --> 00:42:11.245
s and it means caring involvement.

776
00:42:16.905 --> 00:42:21.485
So if I am seeking to build

777
00:42:22.115 --> 00:42:25.605
more relational intimacy in my marriage,

778
00:42:27.835 --> 00:42:30.325
then what we want to see is

779
00:42:30.325 --> 00:42:32.285
that there is an increasing amount

780
00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:37.085
or frequency where we share vulnerably

781
00:42:43.385 --> 00:42:47.925
and we give mutually give

782
00:42:48.065 --> 00:42:49.965
to the need, whatever the need is.

783
00:42:53.065 --> 00:42:56.765
So it helps if Joyce wants to know me deeply,

784
00:42:57.635 --> 00:43:02.285
even in what happened to you today.

785
00:43:02.345 --> 00:43:04.005
That's got you. So down.

786
00:43:06.545 --> 00:43:08.765
Now, since you all know I'm a marriage counselor,

787
00:43:08.925 --> 00:43:10.565
I can't share details of

788
00:43:10.675 --> 00:43:12.365
what goes on in the counseling office.

789
00:43:12.955 --> 00:43:15.165
Okay? That's an ethical violation.

790
00:43:16.845 --> 00:43:19.765
I can say I just had some tough sessions today.

791
00:43:20.005 --> 00:43:21.885
I can say that. Does that make sense?

792
00:43:24.025 --> 00:43:27.245
And then that's me revealing

793
00:43:28.975 --> 00:43:31.515
and her caring might sound like

794
00:43:31.945 --> 00:43:34.635
what she just said when Jason shared earlier.

795
00:43:36.275 --> 00:43:39.415
I'm so sorry that that was hard for you today.

796
00:43:39.535 --> 00:43:44.425
I want you to know, not care that transaction takes 60

797
00:43:44.425 --> 00:43:48.465
seconds or less, but it's heart to heart.

798
00:43:50.085 --> 00:43:51.425
Here's what I'm thinking

799
00:43:51.685 --> 00:43:54.865
and feeling that might be tied to an event

800
00:43:55.445 --> 00:43:56.985
or something I'm concerned about.

801
00:43:58.045 --> 00:44:00.905
And here's a word of care.

802
00:44:01.575 --> 00:44:05.225
Instead of her saying, Aren't you

803
00:44:06.095 --> 00:44:08.145
like 70 years old?

804
00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:11.025
I mean, can't you handle stuff like that better?

805
00:44:13.805 --> 00:44:16.585
Are you that weak? I mean, see, that would be like,

806
00:44:16.945 --> 00:44:19.785
I ain't sharing there, I'm not gonna share with her again.

807
00:44:20.515 --> 00:44:23.025
Right? Because that's not safe

808
00:44:24.785 --> 00:44:28.085
to have any message that says your feelings don't matter,

809
00:44:28.185 --> 00:44:29.885
or you should be over that by now.

810
00:44:31.545 --> 00:44:36.325
So we want to practice being appropriately

811
00:44:37.145 --> 00:44:39.765
and relationally intimate with one another.

812
00:44:40.025 --> 00:44:43.965
And we're going to talk about some things to avoid doing

813
00:44:43.985 --> 00:44:47.445
and some things to do as we move through this course. Can

814
00:44:47.485 --> 00:44:48.485
I add something? Sure.

815
00:44:48.485 --> 00:44:49.485
Um,

816
00:44:50.505 --> 00:44:51.845
The caring involvement

817
00:44:51.945 --> 00:44:55.245
to me means once you tell me something really special

818
00:44:55.425 --> 00:44:59.405
and really deep, I I put kid gloves on.

819
00:45:00.265 --> 00:45:05.045
I'm careful about how I bring that up with you. I even do.

820
00:45:06.145 --> 00:45:07.565
Or what it means to you,

821
00:45:07.755 --> 00:45:11.325
because sometimes people get hurt more

822
00:45:12.795 --> 00:45:14.845
when the caring involvement doesn't take

823
00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:16.125
that into consideration.

824
00:45:17.305 --> 00:45:21.565
So Joyce is bringing up an example of being sensitive

825
00:45:21.905 --> 00:45:25.565
and caring about even how we might bring something up or,

826
00:45:26.185 --> 00:45:29.085
but she's not talking about walking on eggshells.

827
00:45:29.185 --> 00:45:32.245
That's different. This is consideration

828
00:45:32.475 --> 00:45:33.925
that she's referring to.

829
00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:36.525
We want to even get to the point

830
00:45:36.525 --> 00:45:39.045
where in our relationships we can talk about things

831
00:45:39.045 --> 00:45:40.085
that are difficult

832
00:45:41.265 --> 00:45:45.755
or really hurtful that need to get better.

833
00:45:47.335 --> 00:45:51.075
But we would say a good guideline to use there when you try

834
00:45:51.075 --> 00:45:54.955
to have such conversations is captured in this verse.

835
00:45:54.955 --> 00:45:58.115
Ephesians four 15, it says, speak the truth in love.

836
00:45:59.015 --> 00:46:00.555
Two ways to violate that verse.

837
00:46:01.855 --> 00:46:04.995
One would be, instead of speaking the truth in love, I I

838
00:46:05.835 --> 00:46:07.075
hurled the truth at you.

839
00:46:08.475 --> 00:46:13.035
I just unloaded on you in an, uh, trying

840
00:46:13.035 --> 00:46:14.835
to make sure you, you heard me,

841
00:46:14.895 --> 00:46:16.875
but not in a good way. Not in love,

842
00:46:17.405 --> 00:46:18.405
Bruce. Yes.

843
00:46:18.405 --> 00:46:22.115
Can I, uh, I heard what you said

844
00:46:22.215 --> 00:46:23.915
and I agree with what you say.

845
00:46:24.015 --> 00:46:26.675
Mm-Hmm. And one, what I find is

846
00:46:27.235 --> 00:46:30.075
I do this like 2, 3, 4, 5 times.

847
00:46:30.225 --> 00:46:33.795
Yeah. By the time I get to my sixth time, it's like,

848
00:46:33.945 --> 00:46:35.515
this is the reality check.

849
00:46:35.705 --> 00:46:38.715
Yeah. How many times do I have to, and then I have,

850
00:46:38.855 --> 00:46:42.435
and I say, the reason I'm doing this today is because

851
00:46:43.005 --> 00:46:45.475
after the sixth time of doing it that way,

852
00:46:45.735 --> 00:46:46.915
and you're not hearing me.

853
00:46:47.105 --> 00:46:50.035
Yeah. I feel like this is the only way

854
00:46:50.595 --> 00:46:51.795
I actually get your attention.

855
00:46:52.865 --> 00:46:54.635
Good point. Can you speak to that please? Yeah.

856
00:46:54.895 --> 00:46:56.675
I'm glad I'm gonna be kind of brief,

857
00:46:56.695 --> 00:47:01.355
but I'll, I hopefully we'll speak to it, um, when,

858
00:47:02.155 --> 00:47:05.115
regardless of who we're trying to talk to, where

859
00:47:05.115 --> 00:47:07.555
that's the dynamic, okay.

860
00:47:07.655 --> 00:47:10.995
It could be a child Mm-Hmm. An adult child or even a child.

861
00:47:11.775 --> 00:47:15.715
But we would say that speaking truth

862
00:47:15.715 --> 00:47:17.675
and love is still a principle to follow.

863
00:47:19.135 --> 00:47:22.875
But wisdom may tell me that in spite of the fact

864
00:47:22.945 --> 00:47:27.755
that I am following scripture in how I speak to things, uh,

865
00:47:28.115 --> 00:47:30.085
I cannot make that other person respond

866
00:47:30.105 --> 00:47:31.125
in the way I want them to.

867
00:47:31.835 --> 00:47:35.445
Okay. So I may be being appropriate,

868
00:47:35.815 --> 00:47:38.805
being biblical, being led

869
00:47:38.805 --> 00:47:41.085
by the spirit in speaking truth and love.

870
00:47:42.425 --> 00:47:46.285
And if that's not being responded to

871
00:47:47.665 --> 00:47:51.885
in a loving way, um, or at all

872
00:47:52.705 --> 00:47:55.805
or any you mean like there, there might be no response.

873
00:47:55.905 --> 00:48:00.085
No response. Okay. No response. It's like it, yeah.

874
00:48:00.665 --> 00:48:02.085
Now that's, I'm glad you brought up.

875
00:48:02.435 --> 00:48:06.125
It's not always, uh, rude response, right? Right.

876
00:48:06.145 --> 00:48:08.565
But sometimes it's no response at all. No response. Okay.

877
00:48:09.105 --> 00:48:11.485
So I'm not trying to drum up any business for me.

878
00:48:11.485 --> 00:48:15.205
That too would be unethical. Okay?

879
00:48:16.425 --> 00:48:20.645
But, but, um, we would say,

880
00:48:21.275 --> 00:48:24.565
obviously that part of the dynamic hasn't changed

881
00:48:25.185 --> 00:48:26.405
and we need to understand

882
00:48:27.635 --> 00:48:30.165
what is going on in the other person.

883
00:48:30.425 --> 00:48:33.725
And it could be they do not have self-awareness

884
00:48:34.025 --> 00:48:35.885
to know why they aren't responding.

885
00:48:36.865 --> 00:48:41.085
Um, they may have no equipping

886
00:48:41.495 --> 00:48:44.885
themselves for that kind of thing in their growing up years.

887
00:48:45.985 --> 00:48:49.975
Um, and I would say when you've tried as hard as it sounds,

888
00:48:49.995 --> 00:48:52.055
you might have tried, then I would say seek help.

889
00:48:52.155 --> 00:48:53.895
But there's all kinds of different help,

890
00:48:54.275 --> 00:48:55.615
not just counselors out there,

891
00:48:56.635 --> 00:48:58.975
but I'd say even this kind of class,

892
00:48:59.495 --> 00:49:01.335
a starting point for many people.

893
00:49:01.965 --> 00:49:03.855
Okay. Side note.

894
00:49:04.075 --> 00:49:06.815
And I, uh, I am watching my clock back there.

895
00:49:06.855 --> 00:49:09.015
I love where they have it placed. It's very visible.

896
00:49:10.165 --> 00:49:13.375
Side note is, uh, the ministry that we were part of, David,

897
00:49:13.585 --> 00:49:18.095
David and Therea started, uh, 35 years ago, started off

898
00:49:19.245 --> 00:49:23.975
with them teaching these courses very much like

899
00:49:23.975 --> 00:49:27.455
what we're presenting right now to ministry.

900
00:49:27.455 --> 00:49:31.965
Couples pastors

901
00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:33.925
primarily and their spouses

902
00:49:34.995 --> 00:49:38.285
with a few Christian counselors thrown in and so forth.

903
00:49:38.625 --> 00:49:41.685
But they would teach them these principles

904
00:49:41.985 --> 00:49:43.405
and do it free of charge.

905
00:49:45.165 --> 00:49:46.245
'cause they didn't want anything

906
00:49:46.245 --> 00:49:48.285
to hinder them from hearing the message.

907
00:49:49.795 --> 00:49:51.645
They would also put them up in a nice

908
00:49:51.735 --> 00:49:53.165
hotel and pay for all of that.

909
00:49:54.105 --> 00:49:56.125
And some of these pastors were not in

910
00:49:56.145 --> 00:49:57.365
big churches like this one.

911
00:49:57.485 --> 00:49:59.245
They were in little tiny churches

912
00:49:59.335 --> 00:50:00.845
where they barely made enough money.

913
00:50:00.845 --> 00:50:02.445
They had to be bi-vocational.

914
00:50:03.545 --> 00:50:08.285
The point there was, they were called to equip the church

915
00:50:08.385 --> 00:50:09.925
for the work of this ministry.

916
00:50:10.625 --> 00:50:15.165
And if your pastor's marriages aren't solid,

917
00:50:17.045 --> 00:50:19.805
I didn't say perfect, but if they're not solid and grounded

918
00:50:19.985 --> 00:50:24.525
and healthy, the church may not

919
00:50:24.525 --> 00:50:25.615
be it.

920
00:50:25.635 --> 00:50:26.975
It definitely has an impact.

921
00:50:27.665 --> 00:50:31.045
So that's how they started doing this, was teaching it

922
00:50:31.045 --> 00:50:32.205
to the leadership

923
00:50:33.385 --> 00:50:35.765
and then giving them resources if they wanted

924
00:50:35.765 --> 00:50:37.525
to teach it themselves beyond it.

925
00:50:37.985 --> 00:50:40.525
So anyway, I hope that's a starting point for that.

926
00:50:40.525 --> 00:50:42.325
Thank you for sharing that.

927
00:50:44.405 --> 00:50:48.545
Um, so given these three words

928
00:50:49.765 --> 00:50:53.785
and their meanings, deep knowing, uh,

929
00:50:54.765 --> 00:50:56.545
not only, uh,

930
00:50:56.605 --> 00:51:00.065
the revealing say if I'm talking about Joyce in me, it says,

931
00:51:00.065 --> 00:51:01.465
both of us hopefully want

932
00:51:01.465 --> 00:51:03.865
to know the other person's heart deeply.

933
00:51:04.765 --> 00:51:08.425
And hopefully both of us are learning how to reveal

934
00:51:09.015 --> 00:51:12.065
what we feel, what we think and what we hope for.

935
00:51:13.205 --> 00:51:15.065
And then hopefully both of us respond

936
00:51:15.065 --> 00:51:16.105
with caring involvement.

937
00:51:16.125 --> 00:51:17.505
Now, if we are on the same page

938
00:51:17.525 --> 00:51:19.945
and we're just learning that, that's great,

939
00:51:20.075 --> 00:51:22.345
we'll probably make some good progress.

940
00:51:23.845 --> 00:51:26.105
But one thing that is helpful is to

941
00:51:26.805 --> 00:51:28.945
do a check in with your own heart.

942
00:51:31.005 --> 00:51:34.425
How much equipping did I get

943
00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:36.065
experientially growing up?

944
00:51:38.805 --> 00:51:41.505
I'm not talking about did your parents teach you a class?

945
00:51:42.885 --> 00:51:45.785
I'm talking about experiences in which

946
00:51:46.765 --> 00:51:50.105
you experienced someone deeply knowing you

947
00:51:52.365 --> 00:51:55.265
and creating a safe place for you to reveal

948
00:51:55.295 --> 00:51:56.745
what you're thinking, what you're feeling

949
00:51:59.545 --> 00:52:00.845
and carrying involvement.

950
00:52:00.845 --> 00:52:03.445
That if you shared that you were scared

951
00:52:03.545 --> 00:52:07.285
or that you were hurting, you would receive what you needed,

952
00:52:07.995 --> 00:52:12.085
such as comfort, safety, someone standing up for you.

953
00:52:15.095 --> 00:52:16.675
Who knew you liked that growing up?

954
00:52:19.715 --> 00:52:21.405
Some of you may have heard this illustration,

955
00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:24.285
but my dad was the one that hugged us

956
00:52:24.305 --> 00:52:27.085
and was a soft-spoken, kind, loyal,

957
00:52:27.995 --> 00:52:29.485
easy guy to love.

958
00:52:30.425 --> 00:52:32.165
And he meant the world to us kids.

959
00:52:33.025 --> 00:52:36.525
And he, and he expressed his affection perfectly to all

960
00:52:36.525 --> 00:52:37.925
of us on a regular basis.

961
00:52:38.945 --> 00:52:42.485
We knew we were loved by him experientially.

962
00:52:44.065 --> 00:52:46.725
In addition, he would take us to games and stuff like that.

963
00:52:48.745 --> 00:52:52.205
My mom was also a very devoted mom.

964
00:52:52.545 --> 00:52:57.365
She just had a much more stern and harsh dement.

965
00:52:58.425 --> 00:53:01.245
And she was determined that she was going to raise us

966
00:53:01.265 --> 00:53:02.485
to be successful.

967
00:53:04.385 --> 00:53:06.685
And we didn't understand growing up why

968
00:53:06.685 --> 00:53:08.005
that was so important to her.

969
00:53:08.025 --> 00:53:09.445
We figured that out later on.

970
00:53:10.865 --> 00:53:13.285
But we didn't have the same warm fuzzies with her.

971
00:53:13.585 --> 00:53:15.365
So I was gonna say, oh, my dad

972
00:53:16.065 --> 00:53:17.485
is the one who knew me like that.

973
00:53:17.585 --> 00:53:18.965
But here's a problem with that.

974
00:53:19.325 --> 00:53:21.725
I, I'd have had to lie or be in denial.

975
00:53:22.465 --> 00:53:26.685
It wasn't that he didn't love me as much as he could, is

976
00:53:26.685 --> 00:53:29.045
that we never had the deep conversations.

977
00:53:29.985 --> 00:53:32.045
And I just don't think he was equipped to do that.

978
00:53:32.445 --> 00:53:33.845
I don't think he received that.

979
00:53:34.285 --> 00:53:35.725
I don't think he knew how to do that.

980
00:53:36.715 --> 00:53:38.565
Plus he worked six days a week real hard.

981
00:53:40.185 --> 00:53:43.765
But it was basically, I just don't think he ever had any

982
00:53:43.765 --> 00:53:45.245
help dealing with his emotions.

983
00:53:45.385 --> 00:53:48.645
And I've got lots of examples that I witnessed of him

984
00:53:48.785 --> 00:53:51.685
as I got older where I could see he doesn't know

985
00:53:51.685 --> 00:53:53.525
what in the world to do with his own pain.

986
00:53:54.735 --> 00:53:58.555
He just stuffs it. I I wasn't gonna say my mom

987
00:53:58.555 --> 00:54:01.995
because of her disciplinary role that she didn't come to me.

988
00:54:01.995 --> 00:54:06.035
But I did have a, a grandma who lived in the same hometown

989
00:54:06.455 --> 00:54:08.155
and would often take myself

990
00:54:08.215 --> 00:54:13.115
and my ki my siblings, uh, on excursions, picnics,

991
00:54:13.375 --> 00:54:15.715
hiking trips, stuff like that around our town.

992
00:54:16.655 --> 00:54:19.155
And I remember her crawling in a cave with me one time

993
00:54:19.185 --> 00:54:21.875
that we found in Osage County of all places,

994
00:54:23.445 --> 00:54:25.475
which is the subject of a movie

995
00:54:25.545 --> 00:54:26.675
that you might have heard of.

996
00:54:28.575 --> 00:54:30.715
She crawled into that little cave with me.

997
00:54:30.735 --> 00:54:33.475
And I can, I have a faint memory of her talking about,

998
00:54:33.885 --> 00:54:37.755
we're the outlaws and your brother and sister are the posse

999
00:54:37.815 --> 00:54:40.355
and they don't have the foggiest idea of where we are.

1000
00:54:40.775 --> 00:54:41.875
And I'm like, damn.

1001
00:54:43.775 --> 00:54:45.355
Now what did that make you feel when I told you

1002
00:54:45.355 --> 00:54:46.915
that story included?

1003
00:54:48.395 --> 00:54:49.435
Included. Included.

1004
00:54:49.625 --> 00:54:52.475
Okay, anybody else when I just made

1005
00:54:52.475 --> 00:54:53.755
that story or shared that story?

1006
00:54:54.145 --> 00:54:57.115
Just kind of energized. Energized. Okay.

1007
00:54:57.245 --> 00:55:01.555
Happy, happy for you. Yeah.

1008
00:55:01.845 --> 00:55:05.955
Don't miss that. Connected. Sorry. Connected. Connected.

1009
00:55:06.745 --> 00:55:11.475
Yeah. I just shared that in very briefly.

1010
00:55:12.855 --> 00:55:14.635
It had an impact on many of you.

1011
00:55:16.495 --> 00:55:17.755
It was actually an impact

1012
00:55:17.755 --> 00:55:19.955
that in most cases was probably for me.

1013
00:55:19.955 --> 00:55:22.355
Though, you might have been also thinking of experiences

1014
00:55:22.415 --> 00:55:24.395
of your own, that would be normal.

1015
00:55:26.095 --> 00:55:29.875
But what you just did when you said happy, connected, some

1016
00:55:29.875 --> 00:55:31.075
of these other words energized.

1017
00:55:31.625 --> 00:55:35.595
What you just did was Romans 1215 a

1018
00:55:37.035 --> 00:55:38.795
rejoice with those who rejoice.

1019
00:55:38.795 --> 00:55:40.195
See, I told you a story about my

1020
00:55:40.195 --> 00:55:41.915
grandmother who's long gone.

1021
00:55:43.175 --> 00:55:46.795
But it was a very good connection for me growing up.

1022
00:55:46.895 --> 00:55:48.715
She was Grandma Sue.

1023
00:55:50.135 --> 00:55:54.155
She was a hoot, but she connected with me.

1024
00:55:55.175 --> 00:55:58.595
And when I shared that you, some of you, most

1025
00:55:58.595 --> 00:56:03.235
of you possibly felt a measure of joy, we're saying

1026
00:56:03.235 --> 00:56:04.675
that's Romans 1215.

1027
00:56:04.815 --> 00:56:07.555
And guess what? That's a command in scripture.

1028
00:56:09.385 --> 00:56:10.955
It's a good God saying, Hey,

1029
00:56:10.955 --> 00:56:12.715
if you guys will just connect more,

1030
00:56:12.985 --> 00:56:14.275
life will be a little better.

1031
00:56:16.455 --> 00:56:21.155
In the same verse it says, mourn with those who mourn

1032
00:56:21.775 --> 00:56:23.565
or weep with those who weep.

1033
00:56:23.565 --> 00:56:26.485
Mm-Hmm. In this one short verse,

1034
00:56:26.745 --> 00:56:29.445
we have two extremes of connection

1035
00:56:30.585 --> 00:56:34.365
and we're commanded to go there in both of them.

1036
00:56:35.265 --> 00:56:38.645
So when Joyce and I are learning to know each other,

1037
00:56:39.705 --> 00:56:42.845
it doesn't have to always be the negative things in life.

1038
00:56:42.865 --> 00:56:44.805
It can be the rejoicing things in life.

1039
00:56:45.025 --> 00:56:46.805
You know what my opinion is?

1040
00:56:47.355 --> 00:56:51.165
Most churches don't do nearly enough rejoicing

1041
00:56:51.165 --> 00:56:52.205
with those who rejoice.

1042
00:56:53.505 --> 00:56:55.445
I'm not talking about worship time,

1043
00:56:55.905 --> 00:56:57.965
I'm talking about personal rejoicing.

1044
00:57:00.945 --> 00:57:03.105
Somebody said, man, I, I finally passed

1045
00:57:03.105 --> 00:57:04.345
that calculus three class.

1046
00:57:04.505 --> 00:57:08.905
I wish I could say that I finally passed that class.

1047
00:57:09.925 --> 00:57:12.825
And if someone says, well, you're supposed to, aren't you?

1048
00:57:13.485 --> 00:57:14.945
That's on your degree plan, isn't it?

1049
00:57:15.645 --> 00:57:19.025
Do you hear any rejoicing in that? No.

1050
00:57:19.025 --> 00:57:20.385
That's a flat response.

1051
00:57:22.615 --> 00:57:27.405
But if I said, man, I tried three times, never could pass

1052
00:57:27.405 --> 00:57:29.085
that class way to go.

1053
00:57:29.985 --> 00:57:32.045
That's connection. Okay.

1054
00:57:33.635 --> 00:57:35.205
Some of us do it kind of soft spoken.

1055
00:57:35.235 --> 00:57:37.245
Some of us are much more vocal.

1056
00:57:37.755 --> 00:57:40.765
Doesn't matter what your personality is, you can rejoice

1057
00:57:40.765 --> 00:57:41.845
and you can mourn with people.

1058
00:57:42.745 --> 00:57:46.285
That's a big deal. And if we didn't experience

1059
00:57:46.285 --> 00:57:49.005
that growing up, we have to learn it as adults.

1060
00:57:51.585 --> 00:57:53.155
Just have to learn, learn it,

1061
00:57:53.215 --> 00:57:54.595
and we believe, let's practice.

1062
00:57:54.595 --> 00:57:58.235
So what I want you to do right now, uh,

1063
00:57:58.335 --> 00:58:02.635
and if you did this in the, um, Friday night,

1064
00:58:02.915 --> 00:58:04.235
Saturday workshop, if you were there

1065
00:58:04.255 --> 00:58:06.355
and we had you do this kind of exercise,

1066
00:58:06.795 --> 00:58:08.595
I would say just think of somebody else

1067
00:58:10.135 --> 00:58:14.635
who might have even in a small temporary way connected

1068
00:58:14.635 --> 00:58:18.675
with you and share someone who did connect

1069
00:58:18.675 --> 00:58:19.675
with you growing up.

1070
00:58:21.215 --> 00:58:25.035
Uh, I had a science teacher that, uh,

1071
00:58:26.585 --> 00:58:28.075
thought I was a good student,

1072
00:58:28.815 --> 00:58:32.915
but he encouraged me to take that to another level.

1073
00:58:34.975 --> 00:58:39.915
And I think he, I got affirmation from Mr.

1074
00:58:40.625 --> 00:58:44.235
Kofu when I was growing up

1075
00:58:44.235 --> 00:58:47.515
and I could have used a whole lot more affirmation,

1076
00:58:48.815 --> 00:58:49.995
but he was one who did that.

1077
00:58:50.055 --> 00:58:52.995
See? So there's a rejoicing, so take turns

1078
00:58:53.295 --> 00:58:55.835
as a couple, uh, sharing.

1079
00:58:56.895 --> 00:58:59.755
Who knew you growing up? You two ladies could share.

1080
00:59:00.575 --> 00:59:02.355
Um, looking for, is it,

1081
00:59:02.515 --> 00:59:04.395
I don't think we have another man by himself.

1082
00:59:04.555 --> 00:59:08.355
I was gonna try to pair you up, but, uh, contact Jason.

1083
00:59:10.125 --> 00:59:13.555
There you go. You're stuck now.

1084
00:59:14.905 --> 00:59:17.515
Okay. Alright. Go ahead and start sharing now.

1085
00:59:18.745 --> 00:59:19.795
Take a minute to do this.

1086
00:59:22.985 --> 00:59:24.565
Oh, that'd probably be easier. Okay. I

1087
00:59:24.565 --> 00:59:25.605
Was gonna help her wrap that.

1088
00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:29.565
Thank you. Then.

1089
00:59:29.625 --> 00:59:31.285
So we're supposed to talk about some person

1090
00:59:31.285 --> 00:59:33.045
that affirmed us or validated us.

1091
00:59:33.985 --> 00:59:35.965
Do you have someone ready? Okay. I'll,

1092
01:00:09.235 --> 01:00:10.685
it's interesting to me that

1093
01:00:10.945 --> 01:00:12.445
that's still something you enjoy doing

1094
01:00:12.825 --> 01:00:17.045
and that's part of the reason why you really like knowing,

1095
01:00:19.345 --> 01:00:20.965
you know, like being able to name all the people.

1096
01:00:35.025 --> 01:00:38.765
Um, I mean, I'll just go with the one that I,

1097
01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:40.405
I wrote about, which was my grandma.

1098
01:00:40.705 --> 01:00:45.565
Um, I vividly remember, uh, a time where we got to,

1099
01:00:45.625 --> 01:00:48.725
um, pay my grandma before he passed away.

1100
01:00:48.785 --> 01:00:51.125
And my brother and I, for some reason, I don't know why,

1101
01:00:51.705 --> 01:00:53.885
we had to spend like a week at my grandma's house.

1102
01:00:54.065 --> 01:00:55.725
And I remember she had a gift

1103
01:00:55.905 --> 01:00:58.165
for us every morning we'd open up.

1104
01:00:58.985 --> 01:01:00.125
So we'd open up this present

1105
01:01:00.305 --> 01:01:03.565
and the present was a hint of what grandpa that day.

1106
01:01:04.345 --> 01:01:07.245
And so like one of the days it was like flashlight, that

1107
01:01:09.105 --> 01:01:10.165
symbol on the ceiling.

1108
01:01:10.705 --> 01:01:12.325
It was like space. And

1109
01:01:12.485 --> 01:01:13.965
that day he took us to the Space Museum.

1110
01:01:14.925 --> 01:01:16.565
I got my space pen from him.

1111
01:01:18.225 --> 01:01:22.085
He talked about the shows, all the plane things

1112
01:01:22.085 --> 01:01:23.805
that we knew about the engine and stuff.

1113
01:01:23.945 --> 01:01:27.765
And, uh, took us to a restroom and train.

1114
01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:34.365
Um, But, uh, I just felt thought one,

1115
01:01:34.365 --> 01:01:36.925
that first person I felt like kind

1116
01:01:36.925 --> 01:01:39.085
of informed without knowing me at all,

1117
01:01:39.115 --> 01:01:44.085
just straight up was your dad when he just right away,

1118
01:01:44.105 --> 01:01:46.445
you know, helped me go to work, trusted me

1119
01:01:46.445 --> 01:01:49.725
to drive the tractor, and trusted me to learn how to fail.

1120
01:01:50.785 --> 01:01:54.125
Um, Afraid and worried

1121
01:01:54.195 --> 01:01:59.045
That It wouldn't be like, you know, as big

1122
01:01:59.045 --> 01:02:03.965
or as strong or whatever, your brothers or I,

1123
01:02:04.225 --> 01:02:06.485
He just, I felt

1124
01:02:07.705 --> 01:02:09.765
family and trusted.

1125
01:02:23.955 --> 01:02:24.245
Yeah.

1126
01:02:44.945 --> 01:02:45.165
We

1127
01:02:45.165 --> 01:02:47.205
Got about two more minutes before we need to

1128
01:02:47.205 --> 01:02:48.245
Wrap Up this,

1129
01:02:56.915 --> 01:02:58.405
This was Grandma Betty.

1130
01:04:05.315 --> 01:04:10.085
Okay. If I could give you a chance

1131
01:04:10.185 --> 01:04:12.685
to, uh, wrap up

1132
01:04:14.265 --> 01:04:15.885
and if you want to return there

1133
01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.165
or you can stay where you are.

1134
01:04:17.355 --> 01:04:19.285
Okay. That that'd be fine.

1135
01:04:20.665 --> 01:04:22.645
So, um,

1136
01:04:25.705 --> 01:04:27.365
notice what you're feeling right now.

1137
01:04:31.165 --> 01:04:32.165
I say that because

1138
01:04:34.515 --> 01:04:36.925
that was something I failed to do

1139
01:04:36.985 --> 01:04:38.885
for the first 19 years for marriage.

1140
01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:41.445
I did not notice what I was feeling.

1141
01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:48.615
My job was to do, not to be. Does that make sense?

1142
01:04:51.175 --> 01:04:54.575
I was raised with the idea that what matters

1143
01:04:54.715 --> 01:04:57.975
and what brings you worth is how much you can do.

1144
01:04:59.035 --> 01:05:01.655
Mm-Hmm. And I'd say in our culture,

1145
01:05:02.655 --> 01:05:04.815
probably worse than I've seen in my entire life.

1146
01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:06.855
We have a problem being with

1147
01:05:07.235 --> 01:05:12.135
People So much animosity.

1148
01:05:13.315 --> 01:05:14.855
We know that's not coming from God.

1149
01:05:16.945 --> 01:05:19.605
So notice what you're feeling,

1150
01:05:20.115 --> 01:05:22.205
whether it's positive or sadness.

1151
01:05:22.945 --> 01:05:26.125
Uh, sometimes when we think of things that weren't there,

1152
01:05:26.225 --> 01:05:27.605
it brings a measure of sadness

1153
01:05:27.745 --> 01:05:30.285
and we're saying that's part of the healing condition.

1154
01:05:31.305 --> 01:05:35.405
But if you are sad, it would be helpful If someone is sad

1155
01:05:35.545 --> 01:05:38.305
for you, someone comforts you.

1156
01:05:38.305 --> 01:05:40.305
Someone says, I wish

1157
01:05:40.305 --> 01:05:45.305
that hadn't been the way it was 'cause I care about

1158
01:05:48.405 --> 01:05:53.125
Um, if you experienced a good

1159
01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:57.085
memory, uh, it's good to notice that too

1160
01:05:57.905 --> 01:06:01.365
and to actually dwell richly in that.

1161
01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:06.485
'cause the word says God rejoices with

1162
01:06:06.485 --> 01:06:07.485
You.

1163
01:06:09.195 --> 01:06:10.525
Well, I, when I finish today,

1164
01:06:11.185 --> 01:06:12.645
and I have a feeling I'm going

1165
01:06:12.645 --> 01:06:14.605
to go about five minutes long,

1166
01:06:14.745 --> 01:06:18.085
but if I reassure you it won't be more than five minutes,

1167
01:06:19.025 --> 01:06:20.765
it might give you some security.

1168
01:06:21.385 --> 01:06:22.405
But if you have to go

1169
01:06:22.405 --> 01:06:24.725
and I haven't finished, please, I understand.

1170
01:06:25.985 --> 01:06:28.725
But I want to finish with not the connection,

1171
01:06:28.945 --> 01:06:30.725
the focus on the connection in the marriage,

1172
01:06:30.905 --> 01:06:33.965
but a focus on the connection with God.

1173
01:06:35.695 --> 01:06:40.085
Could it be that even as I said earlier, that

1174
01:06:40.085 --> 01:06:42.165
unless we see people the way God sees them,

1175
01:06:42.185 --> 01:06:45.045
we can't love them the way he loves them saying,

1176
01:06:45.045 --> 01:06:46.765
we really need to understand more about what's

1177
01:06:46.765 --> 01:06:47.925
going on inside of them.

1178
01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:52.365
But could it also be true that if we don't see God

1179
01:06:52.365 --> 01:06:56.485
as he really is, we can't love him with our entire heart,

1180
01:06:56.675 --> 01:06:57.805
mind, soul, and strength.

1181
01:06:59.535 --> 01:07:01.045
Great commandment says, love him

1182
01:07:01.045 --> 01:07:03.485
with everything you got heart, mind, soul, and strength.

1183
01:07:03.635 --> 01:07:05.725
Well, if you don't see him as he really is,

1184
01:07:08.235 --> 01:07:09.365
that might be difficult.

1185
01:07:11.425 --> 01:07:15.125
Um, I didn't come to faith in Christ

1186
01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:17.245
until I was 29,

1187
01:07:18.665 --> 01:07:21.245
but I had been in church from the time I was a little boy.

1188
01:07:22.065 --> 01:07:24.005
So I, I had learned a lot about God

1189
01:07:24.105 --> 01:07:26.485
and most of it was good stuff that I learned about

1190
01:07:28.715 --> 01:07:30.805
That somehow I still had this impression

1191
01:07:31.235 --> 01:07:34.845
that God was more focused on my bad behavior than anything

1192
01:07:34.845 --> 01:07:37.045
else That make sense?

1193
01:07:37.065 --> 01:07:40.125
Mm-Hmm. Now he does care about our bad behavior, doesn't he?

1194
01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:43.045
Mm-Hmm. That's very, very sound scripturally.

1195
01:07:43.945 --> 01:07:46.805
But if that's all that I think he's concerned about,

1196
01:07:47.065 --> 01:07:48.405
I'm really missing the mark.

1197
01:07:49.505 --> 01:07:52.205
And if that's all I see him caring about,

1198
01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:54.525
I've got an inspecting God

1199
01:07:56.785 --> 01:07:58.605
that's my primary image of him.

1200
01:07:58.705 --> 01:08:00.885
And I would say that is far from

1201
01:08:00.885 --> 01:08:02.325
everything that I need to see.

1202
01:08:04.545 --> 01:08:08.605
Or what if I have

1203
01:08:09.155 --> 01:08:12.165
felt like an outsider most of my life

1204
01:08:12.345 --> 01:08:16.645
or growing up at least like one who didn't fit in

1205
01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:22.725
and almost everybody was kind of distant to me.

1206
01:08:24.235 --> 01:08:27.285
What if I had a parent who didn't talk to me,

1207
01:08:31.065 --> 01:08:35.925
didn't, didn't enter my world at all, then I might

1208
01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:38.725
project that onto God as well.

1209
01:08:40.665 --> 01:08:43.565
Psychologically, intellectually, I might project that.

1210
01:08:43.715 --> 01:08:47.325
It's kind of like if you're the father figure in my life

1211
01:08:47.345 --> 01:08:49.885
and you don't connect with me, then I might see God

1212
01:08:49.905 --> 01:08:51.965
as must be like you.

1213
01:08:53.285 --> 01:08:55.905
And that would leave me probably having a sense of,

1214
01:08:55.935 --> 01:08:57.385
I've got a distant God,

1215
01:08:58.965 --> 01:09:01.455
he's too worried about planning the second coming.

1216
01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:03.095
He doesn't have time to deal with me.

1217
01:09:03.875 --> 01:09:08.815
Mm-Hmm. Okay. Third example of

1218
01:09:09.775 --> 01:09:11.335
a distorted view of God

1219
01:09:11.355 --> 01:09:13.575
or a one-sided view of God might be

1220
01:09:13.575 --> 01:09:15.375
that he's a condemning God.

1221
01:09:16.595 --> 01:09:17.885
That when he looks at me,

1222
01:09:20.325 --> 01:09:25.185
all he can do is think, oh, you disappoint me all the time.

1223
01:09:25.385 --> 01:09:27.865
I can't believe you don't know how to pray yet

1224
01:09:29.225 --> 01:09:31.985
I can't believe that you haven't led anybody to Christ yet.

1225
01:09:33.605 --> 01:09:35.185
See, that's a disappointing God.

1226
01:09:36.325 --> 01:09:40.065
If you fail inspections with an inspecting God,

1227
01:09:40.065 --> 01:09:41.065
you're probably gonna end up

1228
01:09:41.065 --> 01:09:42.945
with a disappointed image of God.

1229
01:09:44.245 --> 01:09:45.305
Now folks, I'm standing here

1230
01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:47.265
before you saying I knew my Bible.

1231
01:09:47.505 --> 01:09:49.785
I even went to seminary for about three years.

1232
01:09:51.265 --> 01:09:55.025
I should know the right answers to is God a loving God?

1233
01:09:55.165 --> 01:09:59.065
Yes, he is. He's a welcoming God. He's an accepting God.

1234
01:09:59.135 --> 01:10:00.305
He's a gracious God.

1235
01:10:01.645 --> 01:10:04.585
He longs to show me grace.

1236
01:10:06.885 --> 01:10:10.105
So don't you think for a minute about

1237
01:10:11.455 --> 01:10:16.345
have I tended to see God in one of those distorted ways?

1238
01:10:16.805 --> 01:10:18.545
I'm not saying you don't know the truth.

1239
01:10:18.845 --> 01:10:22.025
I'm saying that might be who shows up in your gut

1240
01:10:23.095 --> 01:10:24.305
When You've messed up.

1241
01:10:27.075 --> 01:10:31.945
We've got a God who gives us do overs

1242
01:10:33.805 --> 01:10:35.305
and has already assured us,

1243
01:10:36.455 --> 01:10:38.385
even if we don't get the do over right,

1244
01:10:38.655 --> 01:10:40.065
he's got a place to reserve for us.

1245
01:10:40.065 --> 01:10:40.945
And he's having,

1246
01:10:45.805 --> 01:10:47.465
he longs to show us grace.

1247
01:10:47.465 --> 01:10:50.225
According to Isaiah eight, uh, 30 18,

1248
01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:56.985
David Ferguson that you saw earlier who was our boss

1249
01:10:57.165 --> 01:11:00.945
and mentor, still told a story

1250
01:11:01.765 --> 01:11:04.105
of his first grandchild.

1251
01:11:04.585 --> 01:11:05.985
A little boy named Zachary.

1252
01:11:07.765 --> 01:11:10.625
And Zachary lived three doors down from us when

1253
01:11:10.625 --> 01:11:11.665
we were in Austin, Texas.

1254
01:11:14.225 --> 01:11:17.125
His parents, Zach and Robin, I

1255
01:11:17.125 --> 01:11:21.045
and Robin, I'm sorry, his parents were really good parents

1256
01:11:21.185 --> 01:11:23.605
and Robin worked at the ministry

1257
01:11:23.785 --> 01:11:26.085
and we knew Ike really well.

1258
01:11:26.385 --> 01:11:29.805
Got along well. Ike's an OU fan that made it better.

1259
01:11:32.465 --> 01:11:36.045
So when little Zachary was about a year old, Dave

1260
01:11:36.045 --> 01:11:37.605
and Theresa would sometimes go over

1261
01:11:37.665 --> 01:11:42.285
and house, sit for 'em while they went on a weekend, uh, bed

1262
01:11:42.285 --> 01:11:43.805
and breakfast getaway.

1263
01:11:45.295 --> 01:11:47.565
David said they were doing that one weekend.

1264
01:11:47.625 --> 01:11:50.445
And on that Saturday he woke up

1265
01:11:50.505 --> 01:11:52.885
and he was just having a cup of coffee

1266
01:11:52.985 --> 01:11:55.125
and having a little quiet time in the living room.

1267
01:11:55.145 --> 01:11:56.245
And Theresa came in

1268
01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:58.765
and sat down, started looking at a magazine.

1269
01:11:58.865 --> 01:12:01.965
And so he just kept having his quiet time.

1270
01:12:04.075 --> 01:12:06.695
And then they hear little Zachary stirring in the bedroom

1271
01:12:06.695 --> 01:12:09.415
because they had one of these remote, um,

1272
01:12:09.905 --> 01:12:11.655
audio things where you could hear 'em.

1273
01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:17.095
They hear him stirring and Theresa jumps up out of her sofa

1274
01:12:17.095 --> 01:12:20.415
and goes running in there to spend some time with Zachary.

1275
01:12:21.155 --> 01:12:22.455
Why do you think she's doing that?

1276
01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:28.895
Come on. Why is she running in to see that little baby

1277
01:12:30.035 --> 01:12:32.285
Cynthia woke Up, that's her grand baby.

1278
01:12:33.145 --> 01:12:34.765
She can't wait to see him, right? Mm-Hmm.

1279
01:12:35.065 --> 01:12:36.925
She wants to spend time playing with him, right?

1280
01:12:38.925 --> 01:12:41.935
Holding him, looking in his eyes, talking

1281
01:12:41.935 --> 01:12:44.575
to him like the mom in the still face video.

1282
01:12:47.055 --> 01:12:48.795
And David said as she did that,

1283
01:12:49.655 --> 01:12:52.035
he got an impression from the Lord that said, David, that's

1284
01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:54.035
how I feel towards you when you wake up in the morning.

1285
01:12:54.135 --> 01:12:58.595
Mm-Hmm. I'm excited to love you.

1286
01:13:00.925 --> 01:13:04.205
I can't wait to spend time with you even though you mess up.

1287
01:13:08.305 --> 01:13:12.005
You're My boy. He said, I,

1288
01:13:13.025 --> 01:13:15.685
he had been a Christian for 30 some years by the end,

1289
01:13:15.685 --> 01:13:17.245
been in ministry most of that time.

1290
01:13:17.905 --> 01:13:19.845
And he said, I've never had that thought come across.

1291
01:13:19.945 --> 01:13:23.165
He said, I probably had, he said,

1292
01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:26.525
I he had an inspecting God, which might have had something

1293
01:13:26.525 --> 01:13:28.805
to do with his father being a marine drill

1294
01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:30.405
instructor and an alcoholic.

1295
01:13:31.665 --> 01:13:35.925
Not a good combination. Theresa had a distant God.

1296
01:13:36.065 --> 01:13:38.085
She had a family of six kids

1297
01:13:38.185 --> 01:13:40.085
and three of them were profoundly deaf

1298
01:13:40.785 --> 01:13:43.725
and both parents worked minimum wage jobs.

1299
01:13:45.095 --> 01:13:47.005
There was no time for Theresa.

1300
01:13:50.615 --> 01:13:51.935
I had the disappointed, God,

1301
01:13:52.215 --> 01:13:54.175
I failed inspection way too many times.

1302
01:13:56.775 --> 01:13:59.675
Who did you have? But I let you share that later

1303
01:14:00.325 --> 01:14:02.675
since now we're, we'd be outta time.

1304
01:14:03.195 --> 01:14:07.435
I want to close with a video of David speaking to this issue

1305
01:14:07.975 --> 01:14:10.755
Of A God who is

1306
01:14:14.315 --> 01:14:15.805
excited to show you Grace.

1307
01:14:37.005 --> 01:14:40.325
I was about, uh, mid midway through the year in, uh,

1308
01:14:40.385 --> 01:14:43.685
the book of Isaiah and I came to the passage in Isaiah.

1309
01:14:44.325 --> 01:14:47.725
I remember one particular year, I was about midway

1310
01:14:47.725 --> 01:14:50.125
through the year in, uh, the book of Isaiah

1311
01:14:50.865 --> 01:14:53.845
and I came to the passage in Isaiah 30, verse 18.

1312
01:14:54.705 --> 01:14:57.405
And, uh, it really startled me that morning as the,

1313
01:14:57.405 --> 01:15:01.045
as the passage says, the Lord longs to show you grace,

1314
01:15:01.665 --> 01:15:03.765
and he rises to give you compassion.

1315
01:15:04.325 --> 01:15:07.125
I know that that word longs really has an idea

1316
01:15:07.225 --> 01:15:10.125
of God is excited, almost kind of ringing his hands,

1317
01:15:10.665 --> 01:15:12.165
uh, to give us grace.

1318
01:15:12.225 --> 01:15:14.925
And I remember the impression that morning, David is, uh,

1319
01:15:14.925 --> 01:15:16.965
that's oftentimes not the way you see me.

1320
01:15:17.345 --> 01:15:19.285
Uh, you see me more as a God of

1321
01:15:19.475 --> 01:15:21.125
what we might call reluctant grace.

1322
01:15:21.785 --> 01:15:24.805
Uh, you know, it's like my concept sadly at times was, God,

1323
01:15:25.275 --> 01:15:27.605
he's gonna gimme grace, but he's not really happy about it.

1324
01:15:27.785 --> 01:15:29.725
You know, he, he's gonna forgive me.

1325
01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:31.645
Um, but it's all,

1326
01:15:31.645 --> 01:15:34.125
after all, you know, it's almost like he's God.

1327
01:15:34.185 --> 01:15:37.485
He has to. And the impression was very clearly,

1328
01:15:37.985 --> 01:15:39.205
no, David, I'm excited.

1329
01:15:40.005 --> 01:15:42.805
I I'm wanting to give you grace. I'm wanting to forgive you.

1330
01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:46.365
'cause in this call to love like Jesus,

1331
01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:50.725
it really is the idea that only to the extent that we're,

1332
01:15:51.185 --> 01:15:53.485
uh, experiencing the deepened intimacy of his love,

1333
01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:55.725
can we pass that love along to other people.

1334
01:15:56.225 --> 01:15:57.685
And so I remember the more I thought about

1335
01:15:57.685 --> 01:16:02.215
that was if I have a God who's kind of reluctant, uh,

1336
01:16:02.275 --> 01:16:04.255
to give grace or reluctant to forgive,

1337
01:16:04.525 --> 01:16:06.775
that can come out in my relationship

1338
01:16:06.775 --> 01:16:08.335
with my wife or with my children.

1339
01:16:08.915 --> 01:16:10.175
And what's helped me is

1340
01:16:10.175 --> 01:16:11.815
to meditate on that from time to time.

1341
01:16:12.275 --> 01:16:14.895
And I thought it might be important maybe today for us

1342
01:16:14.915 --> 01:16:16.455
to just pause and meditate on

1343
01:16:16.455 --> 01:16:18.015
that particular passage of scripture.

1344
01:16:18.925 --> 01:16:22.135
Take some time now to continue your Jesus story.

1345
01:16:22.785 --> 01:16:25.935
First, listen to his voice and hear what he wants to,

1346
01:16:27.465 --> 01:16:27.815
Sorry,

1347
01:16:31.845 --> 01:16:32.815
Just for you.

1348
01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:35.095
And after you've heard from him,

1349
01:16:35.405 --> 01:16:37.015
respond back to him in a personal way.

1350
01:16:37.565 --> 01:16:39.855
Tell Jesus what's on your part.

1351
01:16:41.915 --> 01:16:43.175
You'll have about 15

1352
01:16:43.555 --> 01:16:47.095
or 30 seconds right now to just reflect on that.

1353
01:17:10.675 --> 01:17:12.525
Lord, we thank you that we can pause now

1354
01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:15.205
and we can imagine that the great high priest Jesus

1355
01:17:15.825 --> 01:17:20.245
of sitting in the right hand of the Father, um, is wanting

1356
01:17:20.245 --> 01:17:22.445
to minister us grace and compassion.

1357
01:17:22.445 --> 01:17:24.245
Would you just picture and imagine in your heart

1358
01:17:24.245 --> 01:17:26.525
and mind right now, however you imagine Christ,

1359
01:17:27.555 --> 01:17:28.845
however you picture him.

1360
01:17:30.305 --> 01:17:33.765
And as you enter his presence, as you approach the throne

1361
01:17:33.765 --> 01:17:37.245
of grace, imagine that, that Christ

1362
01:17:38.265 --> 01:17:39.925
is excited to embrace you.

1363
01:17:40.115 --> 01:17:42.645
He's excited to love you. He's excited to welcome you.

1364
01:17:42.875 --> 01:17:44.565
He's excited to give you grace.

1365
01:17:46.105 --> 01:17:49.245
And even at your points of disappointment or sadness

1366
01:17:49.425 --> 01:17:53.325
or sorrow or pain, imagine now that Christ rises,

1367
01:17:54.265 --> 01:17:56.125
he rises to hurt with you.

1368
01:17:57.475 --> 01:17:59.295
He rises to give you compassion.

1369
01:17:59.635 --> 01:18:01.095
He is the God of all comfort.

1370
01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:03.455
And you sense from him the tenderness

1371
01:18:03.455 --> 01:18:08.095
and the care of his heart for the pains of life,

1372
01:18:08.275 --> 01:18:09.295
the sorrows of life.

1373
01:18:10.155 --> 01:18:11.215
And he experiences

1374
01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:15.295
and expresses that compassion as a great high priest

1375
01:18:15.515 --> 01:18:18.335
who can sympathize for he himself and his humanity.

1376
01:18:18.665 --> 01:18:21.175
Experience the disappointments, a man acquainted

1377
01:18:21.175 --> 01:18:22.455
with sorrows and grief.

1378
01:18:23.025 --> 01:18:25.855
Would you allow the Holy Spirit to just impress you

1379
01:18:26.085 --> 01:18:29.735
with an embracing grace filled, compassionate Jesus?

1380
01:18:30.235 --> 01:18:33.255
And now, would you allow your heart to give him thanks?

1381
01:18:33.955 --> 01:18:36.375
And out of the gratefulness of that kind of love,

1382
01:18:36.755 --> 01:18:39.895
freely having received of your grace freely having received

1383
01:18:39.895 --> 01:18:42.535
of your compassion, would you empower us

1384
01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:46.815
to freely give it this coming week to those nearest us,

1385
01:18:46.815 --> 01:18:50.055
beginning with a spouse who blessed us with in Jesus' name?

1386
01:18:50.965 --> 01:18:51.965
Amen.

1387
01:18:53.675 --> 01:18:57.215
Let me just, uh, close this by, uh, the word of

1388
01:18:57.495 --> 01:19:00.375
I remember one particular year, I was about mid midway

1389
01:19:00.615 --> 01:19:02.055
through the year in, uh,

1390
01:19:05.415 --> 01:19:09.455
I think I'm having a panic, uh, panic factor.

1391
01:19:10.395 --> 01:19:15.215
Um, I just encourage you that we're all works in progress.

1392
01:19:15.865 --> 01:19:19.175
We're building on whatever is already good in there,

1393
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:23.295
but the Christ in you wants to love this one next to you

1394
01:19:24.005 --> 01:19:28.775
even more, and you're his vessel, just like I am for Joyce.

1395
01:19:29.435 --> 01:19:32.695
Father, be with us this week as we go. In Jesus' name, amen.

1396
01:19:32.965 --> 01:19:34.975
Amen. Thank y'all for giving me five extra minutes.

1397
01:19:35.895 --> 01:19:38.375
Absolutely appreciate you so we'll.
