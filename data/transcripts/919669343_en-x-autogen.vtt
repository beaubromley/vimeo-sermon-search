1
00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.345
Well, well, well, good morning, church.

2
00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:06.145
Morning. It's e it's evening. Today's been a long day.

3
00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:08.385
It's been a long day.

4
00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:11.105
I screeched in here at the very last second.

5
00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:13.705
Thank you, Neil, for accommodating me.

6
00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:16.305
And, uh, great to see each of you.

7
00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:17.745
I saw Mike way there in the back.

8
00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:20.105
My vision is still good enough to see you.

9
00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.945
So good to see you, Mike. And, uh,

10
00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.945
so Wednesday nights are a special time.

11
00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:28.105
Uh, you're, you're the core of the church,

12
00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:29.705
so thank you for coming tonight.

13
00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:32.865
Thank you for your commitment, uh, to the church.

14
00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:35.905
Keep coming. Uh, my name is Ryan Whitaker,

15
00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:39.865
and I've had the, the joy of, uh, serving as one

16
00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:42.425
of your elders now for the last couple years.

17
00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:46.225
And, uh, I really, um, enjoy that.

18
00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:48.425
Uh, just a little bit about myself.

19
00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:53.305
I'm gratefully married to Lindsey for 22 years now,

20
00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:57.665
and we have four kids, uh, from 18 all the way down

21
00:00:57.685 --> 00:00:59.025
to age 11.

22
00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:04.265
And so we've been at Henderson Hills now for about 15 years,

23
00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:09.425
which, uh, blows my mind how fast time flies.

24
00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:13.985
And I'll never forget that day that we, uh,

25
00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:15.385
first visited here.

26
00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:19.505
The very first person that we met was Wally Weaver.

27
00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:23.785
And if you know Wally, you know that he has this huge smile,

28
00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:27.945
this huge welcoming smile, and he greeted us

29
00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:29.425
and showed us to a seat.

30
00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:33.745
And we sat, uh, way in the very back on that,

31
00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:37.305
uh, that column of chairs there, the very back row.

32
00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:42.025
And I'll never forget, I'll never forget that day, um,

33
00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:44.425
because we had been looking for churches

34
00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:46.905
and had visited quite a few churches.

35
00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:52.545
And, um, what we sat under that day, 15 years ago

36
00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:57.265
was, uh, just faithful biblical teaching

37
00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:01.945
from God's word and God centered worship.

38
00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:03.545
And I'll never forget it.

39
00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:05.545
Also, uh, we were worshiping

40
00:02:05.845 --> 00:02:08.425
and, uh, I looked over at Lindsay

41
00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:12.585
and she had, uh, tears streaming down her face,

42
00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:14.985
and I had tears streaming down my face.

43
00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:18.345
And, uh, it was, it was then that we knew that we were home,

44
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.105
and I'll never forget that.

45
00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:26.865
Um, so, uh, you know, as,

46
00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:31.105
as I look back through my time at different churches over my

47
00:02:31.105 --> 00:02:34.625
life, uh, I spent most of my years growing up in under a,

48
00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:36.825
a Baptist church in Irving, Texas.

49
00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:40.425
And, um, past that, I had,

50
00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:43.105
I had a couple years at a Bible church toward

51
00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:44.145
the end of high school.

52
00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:49.185
And then in college, I, I, God led me to a church

53
00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:50.745
that I, I really count

54
00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:53.625
as a pivotal point in my faith journey

55
00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:55.625
that if I hadn't landed there,

56
00:02:55.965 --> 00:02:57.345
who knows where I would've landed.

57
00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:01.485
Um, and so I, I spent four years at a very faithful

58
00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:05.085
biblical Baptist church in Waco, Texas.

59
00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:09.405
And then following college, I, I landed at,

60
00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:12.205
with Lindsay a a Nazarene church.

61
00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:15.285
And so we spent time, uh, nine years in,

62
00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:19.125
in a Nazarene denomination church, uh,

63
00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:22.005
before we, uh, uh,

64
00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.165
and this is a little bit of a spoiler

65
00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:26.285
for this coming weekend's teaching,

66
00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:30.885
but it was, it was during that time in a non reformed church

67
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:36.085
that, uh, scripture really came alive to me.

68
00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:37.325
And I couldn't help

69
00:03:37.385 --> 00:03:41.845
but see some of the reformed teachings in scripture

70
00:03:42.475 --> 00:03:43.805
that led us to here.

71
00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:47.605
And so that's been some of my, uh,

72
00:03:47.605 --> 00:03:49.125
journey, uh, through churches.

73
00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:51.485
And so, I, I'm just curious here.

74
00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:54.165
I can't see too well because of the lights,

75
00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:57.485
but, uh, how many of you, by a show of hands,

76
00:03:57.675 --> 00:03:59.405
have a Baptist upbringing?

77
00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:03.655
Okay, so a good, good number of you.

78
00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:09.175
Uh, what about Presbyterian? Any Presbyterian? Okay.

79
00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:10.655
What about Lutheran?

80
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:16.575
A couple of you And Nazarene. Any Nazarene.

81
00:04:18.275 --> 00:04:23.175
All right. And assembly of God. Okay, great. Great.

82
00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:26.695
Uh, Catholic. Any Catholic upbringing? Okay.

83
00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:31.175
Uh, Bible church, or just kind of a loosely Good. Good.

84
00:04:31.315 --> 00:04:34.535
All right. And, uh, I'm curious,

85
00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:36.495
how many people in a year have only

86
00:04:36.685 --> 00:04:38.455
experienced Henderson Hills?

87
00:04:40.335 --> 00:04:42.065
Okay, that's great. That's great.

88
00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:46.865
Well, tonight we are looking at ecclesiology

89
00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:48.665
or the study of the church.

90
00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:52.505
Now, ecclesiology is the doctrine of the church.

91
00:04:52.645 --> 00:04:55.185
And so on Sundays, John has been walking us

92
00:04:55.185 --> 00:04:57.625
through a series called First Things First,

93
00:04:58.525 --> 00:05:02.185
and this is talking about the core essential doctrines of

94
00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:05.585
the church, uh, and our faith.

95
00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:10.825
And so what we, uh, we're onto now, he's, he's,

96
00:05:10.825 --> 00:05:13.865
we're moving on to what we would call secondary issues.

97
00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:17.385
And these are what he sees as the smaller rocks.

98
00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:20.305
And these are things that believers can differ on and,

99
00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:24.265
and still, uh, still call brothers and sisters.

100
00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:27.905
But it, it necessarily in some ways creates different

101
00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:30.425
churches and different denominations.

102
00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:32.745
And so, ecclesiology

103
00:05:33.085 --> 00:05:36.025
or what makes a church a church is very,

104
00:05:36.525 --> 00:05:39.305
is very much something that causes new churches

105
00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.465
and denominations to form also.

106
00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:45.665
And so, really, it's a tug of war, right?

107
00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:48.305
It, it's a tug of war, um,

108
00:05:48.455 --> 00:05:52.665
because we all want to be unified, right?

109
00:05:53.505 --> 00:05:56.945
Unity is a good and glorious thing. And we also want purity.

110
00:05:57.545 --> 00:06:01.405
We also want purity. We want purity in theology.

111
00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:04.245
We want purity in doctrine.

112
00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:06.685
We want purity in Phil, Phil, uh, Phil, uh,

113
00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:08.325
philosophy, how we do ministry.

114
00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:11.605
We want to be doing things in a pure way that aligns

115
00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:15.125
with scripture, but we don't see it all the same way.

116
00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:19.845
So, uh, it's a tug of war between purity

117
00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:22.205
and unity

118
00:06:22.205 --> 00:06:25.085
because, uh, we can be fully

119
00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:28.765
united if we don't care about what we believe.

120
00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:34.695
Okay? And on the opposite side, if we expect everyone

121
00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:39.895
to believe every single detail of what we believe, then,

122
00:06:40.355 --> 00:06:44.895
um, how many people would we have in our church?

123
00:06:45.915 --> 00:06:49.375
If, if everybody believed exactly what we believed?

124
00:06:50.735 --> 00:06:54.665
Well, it would be a church of exactly one person, it's you.

125
00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:58.345
And that isn't a church. That isn't a church.

126
00:06:59.645 --> 00:07:03.225
So we approach this tug of war with humility,

127
00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:05.065
and that's so critical.

128
00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:08.105
So in Ephesians four, one through three, Paul exhorts us,

129
00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:11.425
he says, I urge you to walk in a manner worthy

130
00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:13.865
of the calling to which he have been called with all

131
00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:16.945
humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing

132
00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:21.145
with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity

133
00:07:21.645 --> 00:07:24.065
of the spirit and the bond of peace.

134
00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:26.545
And so what I'm going to do tonight,

135
00:07:26.565 --> 00:07:28.705
I'm gonna follow John's structure from Sunday,

136
00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:31.305
but we'll put on our scuba gear

137
00:07:31.445 --> 00:07:34.145
and we'll sit on the back of the boat

138
00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.825
and we'll fall backward into the water,

139
00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:39.985
and we'll dive deep into some of these points

140
00:07:40.055 --> 00:07:41.545
that he talked about on Sunday.

141
00:07:41.645 --> 00:07:44.545
We probably can't cover everything tonight, and that's okay.

142
00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:47.545
So let's bow our heads and let's pray together.

143
00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:53.945
Father, we, uh, we see you as God Almighty,

144
00:07:54.685 --> 00:07:58.625
and this is your church, Jesus.

145
00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:01.145
You haven't given any other group

146
00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:03.745
of people the higher honor

147
00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:08.345
or privilege than to call us your body.

148
00:08:10.675 --> 00:08:13.165
Give us your wisdom. Help us to love your church,

149
00:08:14.105 --> 00:08:15.925
to be more committed to it.

150
00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:19.995
Speak to us through your word tonight.

151
00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:24.035
It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. All right.

152
00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:25.955
So John's first question on

153
00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:27.155
Sunday was this, what is the church?

154
00:08:27.185 --> 00:08:30.915
Well, ecclesiology again is, uh, what attempts

155
00:08:30.915 --> 00:08:31.915
to answer this question.

156
00:08:32.695 --> 00:08:35.555
And, uh, this is the doctrine of the church.

157
00:08:35.975 --> 00:08:39.155
And it comes from the Greek word, uh, ecclesia,

158
00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:42.755
which John showed us means called out ones.

159
00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:46.555
We are ones who are called out. We are separate.

160
00:08:46.695 --> 00:08:51.155
And there's a bright line through us, through the church

161
00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:53.715
that marks us off from the rest of the world.

162
00:08:55.855 --> 00:08:59.385
Also, Peter says in one Peter two 11, he says, beloved,

163
00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:02.665
I urge you as sojourners in exiles

164
00:09:02.665 --> 00:09:05.225
to abstain from the passions of the flesh,

165
00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:08.105
which wage war against your soul.

166
00:09:09.325 --> 00:09:13.425
So we're in this strange in between, though,

167
00:09:13.425 --> 00:09:18.145
where we're both in the world, but not of this world.

168
00:09:19.965 --> 00:09:20.995
We're residents here.

169
00:09:21.015 --> 00:09:24.355
We clearly live here and we work here,

170
00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:27.595
but yet, like Peter says, we're also sojourners.

171
00:09:27.595 --> 00:09:31.435
We're also exiles. We're aliens in this world.

172
00:09:31.535 --> 00:09:34.115
So we're living in the already and the not yet.

173
00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:38.115
And this is what the church straddles until he comes again.

174
00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:40.945
So what is the church?

175
00:09:42.825 --> 00:09:45.715
Well, Paul writes to Timothy instructions in one Timothy

176
00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:49.675
three 14 through 16, that he may know

177
00:09:49.975 --> 00:09:53.355
how one ought to behave in the household of God,

178
00:09:53.845 --> 00:09:57.115
which is the Church of the Living God, a pillar

179
00:09:57.655 --> 00:09:59.755
and buttress of the truth.

180
00:10:01.045 --> 00:10:04.755
Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness.

181
00:10:04.815 --> 00:10:06.675
He was manifested in the flesh.

182
00:10:06.735 --> 00:10:11.475
He was vindicated by the spirit, seen by angels proclaimed

183
00:10:11.525 --> 00:10:14.635
among the nations, believed on in the world,

184
00:10:15.085 --> 00:10:17.275
taken up in glory.

185
00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:22.045
And that is beautiful. John mentioned it.

186
00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:25.405
This church that Paul is referring

187
00:10:25.405 --> 00:10:28.885
to in this passage is the invisible church

188
00:10:30.375 --> 00:10:31.515
or the universal church.

189
00:10:31.585 --> 00:10:33.075
It's the big C church.

190
00:10:34.015 --> 00:10:37.835
And, and people often short circuit this,

191
00:10:37.935 --> 00:10:39.795
and they, they somehow think

192
00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:42.195
that the big C church is just the churches

193
00:10:42.295 --> 00:10:43.515
around the world right now.

194
00:10:45.965 --> 00:10:48.025
And that's, that's okay,

195
00:10:48.445 --> 00:10:51.185
but let's, let's understand this more completely.

196
00:10:51.805 --> 00:10:56.145
The universal Church is all genuine believers

197
00:10:56.845 --> 00:10:58.945
across all of history,

198
00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:02.545
and everyone in the future who will believe.

199
00:11:03.565 --> 00:11:07.305
So we're talking about Abraham here. This is Paul.

200
00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:10.825
This is, this is Augustine, this is John Calvin,

201
00:11:11.175 --> 00:11:12.345
this is Edwards.

202
00:11:13.335 --> 00:11:17.345
This is Whitfield, the Wesley brothers, Spurgeon,

203
00:11:18.905 --> 00:11:21.505
Sproul, you and me, God willing.

204
00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:27.245
And this is also God willing, again, you're yet to come.

205
00:11:27.295 --> 00:11:31.975
Great, great grandkids. That is the universal church.

206
00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:35.255
So we have this invisible universal church there,

207
00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:38.455
but there's also what we call the visible church

208
00:11:39.435 --> 00:11:40.855
or the local church.

209
00:11:42.075 --> 00:11:44.095
And in this passage that we just read

210
00:11:44.095 --> 00:11:48.135
through the local church is the church that Paul is writing

211
00:11:48.195 --> 00:11:51.975
to in that whole letter to Ephesus,

212
00:11:52.035 --> 00:11:53.285
the church in Ephesus.

213
00:11:54.545 --> 00:11:58.485
The local church is a local expression of the visible

214
00:11:58.665 --> 00:11:59.965
of the universal church.

215
00:12:00.035 --> 00:12:01.405
It's a local expression,

216
00:12:01.865 --> 00:12:04.365
and we would describe it loosely

217
00:12:04.705 --> 00:12:07.885
as a subset, but guess what?

218
00:12:07.905 --> 00:12:10.085
If we want to get down to the brass tacks,

219
00:12:11.595 --> 00:12:13.205
it's not technically a subset.

220
00:12:15.225 --> 00:12:18.765
The local church uses membership to determine who's in

221
00:12:19.225 --> 00:12:20.325
and who's out.

222
00:12:21.065 --> 00:12:25.845
And we rely on what's called a credible confession of faith,

223
00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:27.885
a credible confession of faith

224
00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:29.925
to determine if you can be a member

225
00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:32.445
or not, just like many churches do.

226
00:12:34.525 --> 00:12:38.945
So the the issue there though is can we, can the elders,

227
00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:41.305
can those who we've designated to interview

228
00:12:42.105 --> 00:12:45.145
possible member candidates, do we know for certain

229
00:12:45.145 --> 00:12:46.385
that you're a genuine believer?

230
00:12:48.195 --> 00:12:52.705
No, we can't know that. Only God knows hearts.

231
00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.145
We don't know hearts.

232
00:12:56.205 --> 00:13:00.065
So the visible church can in fact include

233
00:13:01.015 --> 00:13:03.105
believers and

234
00:13:03.895 --> 00:13:06.385
non-believers, unwittingly.

235
00:13:07.405 --> 00:13:10.945
And that's why the membership process is to, is so important

236
00:13:11.575 --> 00:13:14.505
that it be complete as much as possible.

237
00:13:17.615 --> 00:13:18.795
So if this were a Venn diagram,

238
00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:22.155
the universal church is this huge circle, all believers,

239
00:13:22.295 --> 00:13:24.315
all time, past, present, future.

240
00:13:25.015 --> 00:13:27.635
And the visible church is this smaller circle

241
00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:31.315
that isn't totally contained in the larger circle.

242
00:13:31.315 --> 00:13:33.275
There's some overlap there,

243
00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:37.225
because not everyone in,

244
00:13:37.405 --> 00:13:39.985
not every member in a local church is a genuine believer.

245
00:13:41.005 --> 00:13:44.345
And so that means in this room,

246
00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:46.225
even tonight, this is Wednesday night.

247
00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:49.425
You're the core, the core few, the essentials,

248
00:13:49.565 --> 00:13:53.505
the the truly committed among you that even in this room,

249
00:13:55.515 --> 00:13:57.185
there are seats that are filled

250
00:13:57.245 --> 00:14:00.965
by unbelievers here potentially.

251
00:14:04.175 --> 00:14:05.475
And that's a sobering thought,

252
00:14:08.385 --> 00:14:09.965
but that's a great launch point for us.

253
00:14:10.105 --> 00:14:14.205
The, the church is connected at the hip with the gospel,

254
00:14:14.305 --> 00:14:16.925
and we see this beautiful picture of the mystery of God

255
00:14:17.665 --> 00:14:18.725
in the passage.

256
00:14:18.865 --> 00:14:22.405
We just read this gospel that's available, this mystery,

257
00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:26.325
this gospel that's available to Jew and Gentile alike.

258
00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.925
And it's right there next to this description of the church

259
00:14:31.425 --> 00:14:34.605
as the, the pillar and buttress of the truth.

260
00:14:36.245 --> 00:14:39.865
The gospel is the door and the substance of the church.

261
00:14:39.885 --> 00:14:42.825
And you can't separate the church from the gospel.

262
00:14:43.685 --> 00:14:45.145
So have you ever heard the saying,

263
00:14:45.145 --> 00:14:47.945
you can take the gospel out of the church, but, but you can,

264
00:14:48.045 --> 00:14:50.465
but you can, you can't take the church out of the gospel.

265
00:14:52.375 --> 00:14:53.555
You've, you've never heard

266
00:14:53.555 --> 00:14:54.995
that saying, because it's not true.

267
00:14:56.465 --> 00:15:00.855
Okay? It's not true. It's not a saying at all since the

268
00:15:00.855 --> 00:15:03.975
gospel is the door to our understanding of the church.

269
00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:05.895
Well, what is it? Is this idea

270
00:15:05.895 --> 00:15:07.575
that we were created in the image of God,

271
00:15:07.595 --> 00:15:09.535
but we displeased him.

272
00:15:09.715 --> 00:15:12.215
We dishonored him, we sinned against him,

273
00:15:12.325 --> 00:15:14.295
this holy God of the universe.

274
00:15:14.835 --> 00:15:15.895
But in his mercy

275
00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:19.335
and the great love with which he loved us,

276
00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:22.295
he sent his son Jesus

277
00:15:22.475 --> 00:15:24.775
to live the perfect life that we couldn't live.

278
00:15:25.075 --> 00:15:26.975
And he humbled himself to the point of death,

279
00:15:27.365 --> 00:15:30.135
even death on a cross,

280
00:15:32.075 --> 00:15:36.655
he rose again, victorious over death so that anyone

281
00:15:36.755 --> 00:15:40.255
who believes in him, who calls him Lord,

282
00:15:40.435 --> 00:15:42.095
has eternal life with him.

283
00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.455
And we'll one day see him face

284
00:15:45.515 --> 00:15:48.905
to face in supreme.

285
00:15:49.405 --> 00:15:53.505
No more tears, no more pain, no, uh,

286
00:15:53.765 --> 00:15:55.025
to His glory, right?

287
00:15:57.005 --> 00:15:59.025
And so in this, uh, time on Sunday,

288
00:15:59.095 --> 00:16:01.305
John also described the metaphors of the church.

289
00:16:01.325 --> 00:16:02.945
We see it in this passage we just read.

290
00:16:02.945 --> 00:16:06.265
We saw a metaphor of the household of God.

291
00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:08.145
Uh, the church is a temple.

292
00:16:08.765 --> 00:16:11.265
Uh, we're God's people, we're his flock.

293
00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:15.425
But then we get to this, this body of Christ metaphor

294
00:16:15.425 --> 00:16:17.865
that we see in one Corinthians 12.

295
00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:20.905
So richly, we see Christ as the head.

296
00:16:20.905 --> 00:16:22.305
And this is incredible.

297
00:16:23.365 --> 00:16:26.185
The church is the only thing in the universe

298
00:16:27.055 --> 00:16:28.225
with this privilege

299
00:16:28.225 --> 00:16:31.385
and the honor of being called the body of Christ.

300
00:16:33.095 --> 00:16:36.235
We are the body of Christ under his headship.

301
00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:39.435
Do you see what great an honor that is?

302
00:16:42.315 --> 00:16:43.815
So one of John's questions

303
00:16:44.515 --> 00:16:46.495
on Sunday was this, what is the structure?

304
00:16:46.845 --> 00:16:48.535
What is the structure of the church?

305
00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:50.975
There are many structures of the church,

306
00:16:51.195 --> 00:16:52.575
is the, is the short answer.

307
00:16:53.435 --> 00:16:56.055
But within the Baptist world, we, uh, see often

308
00:16:56.595 --> 00:16:59.255
the structure of senior pastor and a deacon board.

309
00:17:00.255 --> 00:17:02.215
I grew up in a structure like that.

310
00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:06.695
Uh, Henderson Hills was like this until the, the nineties.

311
00:17:08.645 --> 00:17:10.025
So why, why is our,

312
00:17:10.085 --> 00:17:12.905
and John talked at length about this, why, you know how we,

313
00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:16.185
we have a plurality of elders and we have deacons.

314
00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:18.505
We see those two offices in scripture.

315
00:17:18.565 --> 00:17:20.225
We see that in several place.

316
00:17:20.245 --> 00:17:22.945
We see it very clearly in Philippians one, one.

317
00:17:24.205 --> 00:17:27.545
But why, why is our structure considered elder led?

318
00:17:27.875 --> 00:17:30.425
Elder led? So one Timothy three, one

319
00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.625
through 13 talks about that.

320
00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:34.585
And I, I won't reread all of that.

321
00:17:34.925 --> 00:17:36.105
We have limited time tonight.

322
00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:37.945
We, we talked about that at length on Sunday.

323
00:17:38.605 --> 00:17:42.705
But, uh, again, much of what we, much of how we,

324
00:17:43.845 --> 00:17:45.505
uh, lead the church

325
00:17:45.845 --> 00:17:49.605
and govern the church, we search the scriptures

326
00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:55.005
desperately for his wisdom in how to do our church

327
00:17:55.185 --> 00:17:56.685
and how to lead the church

328
00:17:56.705 --> 00:17:58.685
and how, how to care for the church.

329
00:17:58.785 --> 00:18:02.565
And we see in scripture this plurality of elders

330
00:18:02.675 --> 00:18:06.805
that leads feeds, cares for and protects the church.

331
00:18:09.115 --> 00:18:11.295
So we're sre we're squeezing as much info

332
00:18:11.295 --> 00:18:12.535
as we can out of scripture.

333
00:18:13.275 --> 00:18:14.855
And there's also not a lot

334
00:18:15.525 --> 00:18:17.455
else in scripture that we can follow.

335
00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:18.575
So there's not a lot there,

336
00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:20.815
but it's clear there are two distinct offices,

337
00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:22.575
elders and deacons.

338
00:18:23.475 --> 00:18:25.095
So that's a din that's a distinction.

339
00:18:25.095 --> 00:18:27.655
This, this ecclesiology of our church versus,

340
00:18:27.835 --> 00:18:29.575
say the Catholic church.

341
00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:32.095
A Catholic structure is, is very complex,

342
00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:33.815
very ornate, I would say.

343
00:18:34.235 --> 00:18:36.775
And it's informed by scripture

344
00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:41.215
and tradition together.

345
00:18:42.275 --> 00:18:46.265
But we see that scripture prescribes a much simpler

346
00:18:47.185 --> 00:18:50.265
structure, one with a plurality of elders who lead feed care

347
00:18:50.265 --> 00:18:52.625
for and protect the church.

348
00:18:52.625 --> 00:18:55.025
And we also see the office of Deacon who are,

349
00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:58.865
as John said on Sunday, the leading servants of the church.

350
00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:01.665
Well, let's, let's dive in a little bit deeper.

351
00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:06.265
How specifically is Henderson Hills governed?

352
00:19:06.455 --> 00:19:09.105
Well, we see how Henderson Hills governed

353
00:19:09.645 --> 00:19:13.985
as an elder led yet congregationally

354
00:19:14.665 --> 00:19:16.545
governed church.

355
00:19:17.175 --> 00:19:21.265
This is Congregationalism Congregationalism.

356
00:19:21.885 --> 00:19:23.825
So the elders lead the church give

357
00:19:23.855 --> 00:19:25.745
with their God-given authority,

358
00:19:26.845 --> 00:19:29.345
but under the authority of Christ

359
00:19:29.445 --> 00:19:32.585
and his word, the congregation has the final

360
00:19:33.235 --> 00:19:36.305
human authority within Henderson Hills.

361
00:19:37.835 --> 00:19:40.655
So our church participation in the Baptist

362
00:19:40.665 --> 00:19:42.575
Convention is voluntary.

363
00:19:42.635 --> 00:19:43.815
We, we are part of that.

364
00:19:44.155 --> 00:19:47.455
And each church within the convention that associates

365
00:19:47.455 --> 00:19:49.615
with the convention has autonomy.

366
00:19:49.995 --> 00:19:53.215
And we don't have the central governing authority.

367
00:19:53.795 --> 00:19:57.335
But the final human authority at Henderson Hills is vested

368
00:19:57.335 --> 00:19:58.455
within the members.

369
00:20:00.105 --> 00:20:04.055
Again, that's elder led congregationally governed,

370
00:20:04.055 --> 00:20:06.015
and there's biblical support for that.

371
00:20:06.075 --> 00:20:09.775
We see that in Matthew 16. We see that in Matthew 18.

372
00:20:09.795 --> 00:20:12.655
We see that in one Corinthians five, acts six, acts 13.

373
00:20:13.235 --> 00:20:15.655
Let me read for you, Matthew 18, 15 through 18.

374
00:20:15.655 --> 00:20:17.295
You're very familiar with this passage.

375
00:20:19.215 --> 00:20:21.315
If you're brother sins against you, go

376
00:20:21.335 --> 00:20:24.635
and tell him his fault between you and him alone.

377
00:20:25.255 --> 00:20:27.675
If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.

378
00:20:29.235 --> 00:20:31.135
But if he does not listen, take one

379
00:20:31.155 --> 00:20:32.655
or two others along with you,

380
00:20:32.655 --> 00:20:36.015
that every charge may be established by the evidence of two

381
00:20:36.155 --> 00:20:37.375
or three witnesses.

382
00:20:38.635 --> 00:20:41.175
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church.

383
00:20:42.355 --> 00:20:44.935
And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be

384
00:20:44.935 --> 00:20:48.645
to a, to you as a gentile and a tax collector.

385
00:20:49.795 --> 00:20:52.305
Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be

386
00:20:52.385 --> 00:20:54.105
bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on

387
00:20:54.105 --> 00:20:55.265
earth shall be loose in heaven.

388
00:20:56.045 --> 00:20:58.225
So there's something major to see there,

389
00:20:58.815 --> 00:21:02.065
that it's the church, the members, the people

390
00:21:02.655 --> 00:21:05.865
that have the final authority in this case,

391
00:21:05.925 --> 00:21:07.425
to excommunicate someone.

392
00:21:08.015 --> 00:21:10.465
That final verse there where it says, um,

393
00:21:11.505 --> 00:21:13.265
whatever you loose on earth shall be loose in heaven,

394
00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:15.785
bind on, uh, bind on earth bound in heaven.

395
00:21:16.015 --> 00:21:19.345
It's talking about church discipline there, okay?

396
00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:20.585
It's not talking about binding the devil

397
00:21:20.645 --> 00:21:21.865
and things like that, but it's talking about

398
00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:22.945
church discipline.

399
00:21:23.005 --> 00:21:26.025
So the members have the final authority

400
00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:30.265
to excommunicate someone, okay,

401
00:21:30.365 --> 00:21:31.905
to disallow somebody from,

402
00:21:32.055 --> 00:21:34.505
from the congregation, from the body.

403
00:21:36.575 --> 00:21:40.915
So, uh, certainly we, uh, we practice church discipline.

404
00:21:40.915 --> 00:21:42.075
That's a much wider topic.

405
00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:44.355
We're open for questions for that later.

406
00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:48.355
Uh, we have, uh, different ways of handling that, um,

407
00:21:48.385 --> 00:21:51.155
some very biblically informed ways of handling that.

408
00:21:51.695 --> 00:21:55.635
Uh, we have these terms, xco, ea and X communication.

409
00:21:56.135 --> 00:21:58.155
Uh, we, we we're happy to talk with you about that,

410
00:21:58.215 --> 00:21:59.635
if you want to talk, uh, hear more about

411
00:21:59.635 --> 00:22:00.955
that in the q and a later.

412
00:22:03.035 --> 00:22:04.575
So again, I just wanna reiterate,

413
00:22:04.575 --> 00:22:07.375
we're elder led congregational church.

414
00:22:07.435 --> 00:22:10.255
And this is in contrast to churches

415
00:22:11.265 --> 00:22:13.655
where elders make the final decision

416
00:22:14.265 --> 00:22:16.255
where the buck stops with the elders.

417
00:22:16.395 --> 00:22:20.575
That's not us. That's a model called elder ruled.

418
00:22:20.945 --> 00:22:23.975
Elder ruled, which I believe most churches

419
00:22:24.155 --> 00:22:25.855
who uphold this, I could be wrong.

420
00:22:26.075 --> 00:22:27.095
Uh, certainly Joe

421
00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:28.895
and Aaron can speak to this as they come up here,

422
00:22:29.195 --> 00:22:31.135
but I believe most, most churches who

423
00:22:31.195 --> 00:22:34.895
who are elder ruled tend to be, um, other reformed churches,

424
00:22:35.615 --> 00:22:38.655
presbyterian churches, uh, churches like that.

425
00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:43.935
Um, uh, so most are elder ruled as, as opposed to elder led.

426
00:22:43.955 --> 00:22:46.415
So we are elder led decon, conserved,

427
00:22:46.715 --> 00:22:48.255
congregationally ruled.

428
00:22:48.515 --> 00:22:49.535
So that's right. Uh,

429
00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:50.175
so we're talking about

430
00:22:50.175 --> 00:22:51.575
membership here just a little bit here.

431
00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:54.215
Uh, as a member here, you have a measure of authority.

432
00:22:54.955 --> 00:22:58.375
So don't, don't, uh, don't not see that.

433
00:22:58.435 --> 00:23:00.815
That's a, that's an amazing privilege. That's a benefit.

434
00:23:01.235 --> 00:23:02.775
And you may even see that as a responsibility.

435
00:23:02.795 --> 00:23:03.935
It is a responsibility.

436
00:23:05.195 --> 00:23:08.015
You have the, you have several responsibilities when you

437
00:23:08.015 --> 00:23:09.895
become a member at Henderson Hills.

438
00:23:10.295 --> 00:23:13.335
Probably more responsibilities than at most churches.

439
00:23:14.835 --> 00:23:19.135
So you have the ability to select, rebuke,

440
00:23:19.475 --> 00:23:21.815
and dismiss the lead teaching pastor.

441
00:23:23.175 --> 00:23:26.475
You can select, rebuke, dismiss deacons,

442
00:23:27.815 --> 00:23:29.275
and do the same with elders.

443
00:23:31.055 --> 00:23:33.715
You can select full-time, pastoral staff members.

444
00:23:34.245 --> 00:23:36.715
These are, you'll, you'll see that from time

445
00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.075
to time when they come on stage.

446
00:23:38.095 --> 00:23:40.155
And, and these are called positions.

447
00:23:40.655 --> 00:23:44.155
You vote for these called pastoral positions.

448
00:23:45.865 --> 00:23:50.525
You make major decisions alongside us, uh, related

449
00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:53.445
to building and facility issues.

450
00:23:55.015 --> 00:23:58.595
You get to approve financial budgets here at Henderson,

451
00:23:58.595 --> 00:24:01.675
which we're just about to launch into that very, very soon.

452
00:24:01.695 --> 00:24:03.035
So be looking forward to that.

453
00:24:04.055 --> 00:24:07.035
You get to, uh, vote on the amending of bylaws,

454
00:24:08.095 --> 00:24:10.675
and you also get to speak into other matter matters

455
00:24:10.675 --> 00:24:13.595
that the Elder, elder Council, uh, would like

456
00:24:13.595 --> 00:24:17.155
to have your advice on and counsel on.

457
00:24:18.475 --> 00:24:20.615
You have additional responsibilities also, as members.

458
00:24:20.915 --> 00:24:24.095
You, you are called to live holy lives.

459
00:24:26.005 --> 00:24:29.185
How you are is a reflection of the church

460
00:24:29.365 --> 00:24:33.545
and ultimately a reflection on Christ himself.

461
00:24:35.025 --> 00:24:36.605
That's a weighty responsibility.

462
00:24:37.505 --> 00:24:39.325
You have the responsibility to have meaningful

463
00:24:39.325 --> 00:24:40.485
relationships with one another.

464
00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:42.205
And, and you also have this responsibility

465
00:24:42.465 --> 00:24:44.685
to regularly attend church.

466
00:24:46.215 --> 00:24:50.785
Some churches have, uh, enact discipline on members

467
00:24:51.045 --> 00:24:53.065
who, uh, don't attend.

468
00:24:53.895 --> 00:24:57.865
Okay? So, so it's a, it's a big deal that you attend church.

469
00:24:58.135 --> 00:24:59.265
It's an important part.

470
00:25:00.645 --> 00:25:02.425
So that's a brief bit on our structure,

471
00:25:02.545 --> 00:25:04.345
a little bit more clarity, a little bit more depth on

472
00:25:04.345 --> 00:25:06.105
what John spoke of on Sunday.

473
00:25:06.345 --> 00:25:07.585
I hope that's helpful to you.

474
00:25:08.085 --> 00:25:11.425
So that brings us now to the meat of the night.

475
00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:14.505
What makes a church a church,

476
00:25:16.565 --> 00:25:17.815
what makes a church a church,

477
00:25:18.275 --> 00:25:20.495
versus people hanging out together

478
00:25:20.795 --> 00:25:23.655
and having a Bible study together.

479
00:25:24.935 --> 00:25:27.435
So John described it as three markers.

480
00:25:27.435 --> 00:25:30.315
Essentially, he said it as worshiping God,

481
00:25:31.265 --> 00:25:33.795
nurturing believers, and living scent.

482
00:25:34.495 --> 00:25:37.075
And that's absolutely right. That's absolutely right.

483
00:25:37.075 --> 00:25:40.555
That encompasses what makes a church a church.

484
00:25:41.275 --> 00:25:45.275
A church is a gathering of believers who worship God.

485
00:25:46.225 --> 00:25:48.595
This is a place that nurtures our faith,

486
00:25:50.395 --> 00:25:51.855
and it lives to be a means

487
00:25:51.855 --> 00:25:54.615
of accomplishing God's mission in the world.

488
00:25:56.995 --> 00:25:59.015
But let's, let's, for the purpose of tonight,

489
00:25:59.195 --> 00:26:01.455
expand this understanding a little wider.

490
00:26:01.585 --> 00:26:04.975
Let's cast a wider net, more detailed net here.

491
00:26:05.555 --> 00:26:07.615
So let's hear what some theologians have

492
00:26:07.615 --> 00:26:10.095
to say about this question of what makes a church a church.

493
00:26:10.675 --> 00:26:13.135
So if we were to have John Calvin here

494
00:26:13.435 --> 00:26:16.255
and Martin Luther here, I would say,

495
00:26:16.255 --> 00:26:17.495
what makes a church a church?

496
00:26:17.675 --> 00:26:18.895
And this is what they would say.

497
00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:21.295
So John, John Calvin, you know him.

498
00:26:21.445 --> 00:26:23.015
He's the French reformer

499
00:26:23.875 --> 00:26:28.095
and, uh, lawyer who identified two things

500
00:26:28.285 --> 00:26:30.375
that make a church a church.

501
00:26:31.405 --> 00:26:34.905
Calvin said, wherever we see the word of God

502
00:26:35.485 --> 00:26:38.105
purely preached and heard,

503
00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:42.545
and the sacraments, which are the Lord's Supper and baptism,

504
00:26:43.105 --> 00:26:45.845
and where we see the, the sacraments administered according

505
00:26:45.905 --> 00:26:49.485
to Christ's institution, there it is not

506
00:26:49.485 --> 00:26:52.685
to be doubted A church of God exists.

507
00:26:54.775 --> 00:26:57.475
If Luther was asked the question right here, he,

508
00:26:57.475 --> 00:27:00.355
he defined the church as the congregation

509
00:27:00.355 --> 00:27:03.275
of saints in which the gospel is rightly taught

510
00:27:04.895 --> 00:27:06.995
and the sacraments rightly administered.

511
00:27:07.655 --> 00:27:11.075
So here we see two things that make a church, a church,

512
00:27:11.485 --> 00:27:13.315
God's word rightly preached,

513
00:27:13.815 --> 00:27:15.475
and the practice of the sacraments,

514
00:27:15.495 --> 00:27:19.955
or what we would call here ordinances, that's

515
00:27:19.985 --> 00:27:21.955
what makes a church a church.

516
00:27:22.095 --> 00:27:25.115
All that to say, though, is if you ask any theologian

517
00:27:25.215 --> 00:27:27.795
or church leader what makes a church a church,

518
00:27:27.885 --> 00:27:30.035
you'd probably get some different answers.

519
00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:34.595
But we're all saying essentially the same thing, in which,

520
00:27:34.595 --> 00:27:38.915
which, and I've attempted to boil down that for you tonight.

521
00:27:39.895 --> 00:27:41.995
So we'll make it through this together.

522
00:27:42.085 --> 00:27:45.475
We'll examine each of these points as, uh, signposts.

523
00:27:45.895 --> 00:27:48.875
And each of these signposts taken together are ones

524
00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:51.715
that you can kind of walk by and understand.

525
00:27:51.745 --> 00:27:53.715
Yeah, this is a church.

526
00:27:54.585 --> 00:27:59.515
This is a church signposts number

527
00:27:59.865 --> 00:28:04.715
zero, signpost number zero of what makes a church a church

528
00:28:06.135 --> 00:28:08.155
is that it is doxological.

529
00:28:09.625 --> 00:28:10.845
It is doxological.

530
00:28:11.705 --> 00:28:15.925
And I have this as signpost zero since this precedes

531
00:28:16.065 --> 00:28:19.245
and permeates every other signpost.

532
00:28:20.825 --> 00:28:25.635
Doxological comes from this root doxology, the Greek word,

533
00:28:25.735 --> 00:28:29.905
do two parts, dosa,

534
00:28:30.355 --> 00:28:32.905
which means glory or praise,

535
00:28:33.805 --> 00:28:37.705
and Lagos, which means a speaking

536
00:28:38.165 --> 00:28:39.305
or a word.

537
00:28:40.365 --> 00:28:43.945
So if we are doxological, we are praising him,

538
00:28:45.705 --> 00:28:49.665
speaking of his glory, we are speaking of his glory.

539
00:28:50.135 --> 00:28:54.345
When we are doxological, churches are oriented

540
00:28:54.605 --> 00:28:56.505
to glorify God, first

541
00:28:56.605 --> 00:28:59.345
and foremost, to rightly give him the honor

542
00:28:59.685 --> 00:29:03.825
and glory, do his name above all else.

543
00:29:04.005 --> 00:29:07.185
We see this crystallized in the Westminster Shorter

544
00:29:07.295 --> 00:29:09.185
catechism, which asks,

545
00:29:09.655 --> 00:29:12.425
what is the chief end of man?

546
00:29:12.995 --> 00:29:15.625
Which says, what? I know some of you know this.

547
00:29:15.655 --> 00:29:19.965
What does that say? Does

548
00:29:19.965 --> 00:29:21.005
anybody know what, what?

549
00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:24.325
The Westminster shorter catechism question one asks,

550
00:29:28.205 --> 00:29:31.065
call less, okay, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

551
00:29:31.485 --> 00:29:35.505
It says To glorify God and enjoy him forever.

552
00:29:36.575 --> 00:29:40.665
That is our purpose. It's to, to, to glorify God

553
00:29:40.665 --> 00:29:41.805
and enjoy him forever.

554
00:29:43.405 --> 00:29:48.265
Romans 1136 says, for from him and through him

555
00:29:48.645 --> 00:29:52.705
and to him are all things to him

556
00:29:53.245 --> 00:29:55.345
be glory forever and ever.

557
00:29:55.695 --> 00:29:58.465
Amen. For to give him glory.

558
00:29:58.525 --> 00:30:02.745
One Corinthians 10 31 says, so whether you eat or drink,

559
00:30:03.805 --> 00:30:07.825
or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God,

560
00:30:08.735 --> 00:30:11.505
including how you do church.

561
00:30:13.135 --> 00:30:15.715
One Peter two, nine through 11 says,

562
00:30:15.935 --> 00:30:19.275
but you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood of people

563
00:30:19.655 --> 00:30:20.955
for his own possession,

564
00:30:22.445 --> 00:30:25.775
that you may proclaim the excellencies of him

565
00:30:25.835 --> 00:30:30.655
who called you out of darkness and into his marvelous light.

566
00:30:31.165 --> 00:30:33.615
Once you are not a people, but now you're God's people.

567
00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:35.375
Once you had not received mercy,

568
00:30:35.515 --> 00:30:38.335
but now you have received mercies, we are

569
00:30:38.335 --> 00:30:40.695
to proclaim the excellencies of him

570
00:30:40.695 --> 00:30:43.495
who called us outta darkness into his light.

571
00:30:43.645 --> 00:30:45.775
That is to give him glory.

572
00:30:46.765 --> 00:30:48.135
Philippians four, four says,

573
00:30:48.415 --> 00:30:49.815
rejoice in the, in the Lord, always.

574
00:30:49.815 --> 00:30:52.455
And again, I say, rejoice all glory

575
00:30:52.795 --> 00:30:55.175
to him, all glory to him.

576
00:30:55.365 --> 00:30:59.215
Amen. Our joy is welded

577
00:30:59.595 --> 00:31:00.735
to his glory.

578
00:31:00.835 --> 00:31:02.495
And you can't separate the two.

579
00:31:03.525 --> 00:31:06.175
Part of what makes a church a church is that it is first

580
00:31:06.235 --> 00:31:07.975
and foremost doxological.

581
00:31:08.235 --> 00:31:11.055
It is His glory that we speak of.

582
00:31:11.835 --> 00:31:15.535
And that leads us to signpost. Number one.

583
00:31:16.745 --> 00:31:19.165
Calvin and Luther were aren't alone in that.

584
00:31:19.165 --> 00:31:22.765
They pegged the right preaching of God's word as the first

585
00:31:22.865 --> 00:31:26.205
and foremost concrete qualifier of

586
00:31:26.205 --> 00:31:27.845
what constitutes a church.

587
00:31:28.735 --> 00:31:33.245
First Timothy four 13, Paul says, to devote yourselves

588
00:31:34.665 --> 00:31:36.245
to the public reading of scripture,

589
00:31:36.265 --> 00:31:37.885
to exhortation, to teaching.

590
00:31:38.665 --> 00:31:41.445
And we at Henderson Hills, we have a deep conviction

591
00:31:41.555 --> 00:31:44.325
regarding the authority, the sufficiency, the,

592
00:31:44.545 --> 00:31:47.645
the inerrancy, the clarity of God's word.

593
00:31:48.425 --> 00:31:51.925
It is our anchoring truth. We say here, and you know what?

594
00:31:51.995 --> 00:31:54.685
That is exactly, exactly

595
00:31:54.835 --> 00:31:59.525
what we heard 15 years ago when we visited 15 years ago,

596
00:31:59.625 --> 00:32:02.485
in that back row of seats, that's what we heard.

597
00:32:04.085 --> 00:32:06.225
So scripture as the foundation of our faith,

598
00:32:06.285 --> 00:32:09.585
it shapes our beliefs, it guides our actions.

599
00:32:09.645 --> 00:32:12.985
It follows then that rightly preaching God's word

600
00:32:13.535 --> 00:32:15.785
must be central to the life and the health of the church.

601
00:32:16.445 --> 00:32:19.945
An expository preaching is particularly vital

602
00:32:19.945 --> 00:32:22.025
because it adheres most faithfully

603
00:32:22.485 --> 00:32:24.145
to this biblical commitment.

604
00:32:25.205 --> 00:32:30.015
What is expository preaching? What is expository preaching?

605
00:32:31.595 --> 00:32:35.495
In expository preaching, the pastor takes a specific passage

606
00:32:35.555 --> 00:32:39.325
of scripture, systematically unpacks the meaning,

607
00:32:39.865 --> 00:32:41.525
the relevance, the application.

608
00:32:42.385 --> 00:32:44.885
And one way to say it is for how

609
00:32:44.885 --> 00:32:46.485
to define expository preaching.

610
00:32:46.545 --> 00:32:50.845
The point of the passage is the point of the message.

611
00:32:52.895 --> 00:32:55.195
The point of the passage is the point of the message.

612
00:32:56.455 --> 00:32:57.915
And so this, this type of preaching,

613
00:32:57.915 --> 00:32:59.795
expository preaching ensures

614
00:32:59.795 --> 00:33:03.795
that we're seeing the full scope of God's word week

615
00:33:03.845 --> 00:33:08.515
after week, and it is exposing God's word to us.

616
00:33:09.495 --> 00:33:13.195
And it guards against avoiding difficult passages

617
00:33:14.015 --> 00:33:17.275
or allowing us to focus on our, our favorite

618
00:33:17.835 --> 00:33:20.115
personal topics, which we all want to do,

619
00:33:21.615 --> 00:33:22.875
but it guards against that.

620
00:33:24.545 --> 00:33:27.005
You know, you, you can, you can hear when it's not

621
00:33:27.215 --> 00:33:28.965
expository preaching, can't you?

622
00:33:29.785 --> 00:33:33.045
You can hear it. You can hear when somebody has an axe

623
00:33:33.045 --> 00:33:37.545
to grind their, they're using scripture to advance their,

624
00:33:37.555 --> 00:33:39.505
their own agenda or trying

625
00:33:39.505 --> 00:33:42.705
to reinforce their political bent, can't you?

626
00:33:42.885 --> 00:33:46.255
You can hear it. So the deciding factor

627
00:33:46.255 --> 00:33:48.575
that causes some preachers to be effective

628
00:33:48.635 --> 00:33:53.495
and others ineffective, is their confidence in the power

629
00:33:53.995 --> 00:33:55.495
of God's word.

630
00:33:56.925 --> 00:34:00.215
Paul Exhorts Timothy in two Timothy four, one, he says,

631
00:34:00.335 --> 00:34:02.055
I charge you in the presence of God

632
00:34:02.115 --> 00:34:05.295
and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living and the dead.

633
00:34:05.315 --> 00:34:06.335
And by his appearing

634
00:34:06.335 --> 00:34:10.255
and his kingdom, preach the word, be ready in season, out

635
00:34:10.255 --> 00:34:14.215
of season, reprove rebuke exhort with complete patience

636
00:34:14.215 --> 00:34:17.295
and teaching for the time is coming when people will not

637
00:34:17.315 --> 00:34:19.535
endure sound teaching, but have,

638
00:34:19.795 --> 00:34:22.415
but having itching ears, they'll accumulate

639
00:34:22.415 --> 00:34:25.255
for themselves teachers to suit their own passions

640
00:34:25.635 --> 00:34:27.935
and will turn away from listening to the truth

641
00:34:27.955 --> 00:34:29.855
and wander off and to myths.

642
00:34:31.655 --> 00:34:35.705
Is topical preaching? Okay, it's topic preaching.

643
00:34:35.735 --> 00:34:40.515
Okay, well, we favor expository preaching, certainly,

644
00:34:40.575 --> 00:34:43.755
but did you know that in our history, uh,

645
00:34:43.755 --> 00:34:45.035
we've had topical series?

646
00:34:46.135 --> 00:34:49.965
We think that's okay. We think that's okay, can be argued

647
00:34:49.965 --> 00:34:51.565
that you can do topical exposition,

648
00:34:51.985 --> 00:34:53.645
but I think that's an argument for another day.

649
00:34:54.585 --> 00:34:57.045
We certainly favor expository preaching.

650
00:34:58.405 --> 00:35:03.015
Does expository preaching equal verse by verse preaching?

651
00:35:06.225 --> 00:35:07.525
No, not necessarily.

652
00:35:08.265 --> 00:35:10.045
If you're preaching what the passage is saying,

653
00:35:10.045 --> 00:35:12.285
and you're not bringing your own meaning to the text,

654
00:35:12.915 --> 00:35:14.365
that is expository,

655
00:35:15.225 --> 00:35:18.405
and verse by verse is a type of expository preaching.

656
00:35:20.435 --> 00:35:21.655
So we've seen now that part of

657
00:35:21.655 --> 00:35:22.775
what makes a church a church is

658
00:35:22.775 --> 00:35:26.335
that it is fundamentally doxological speaks of his glory,

659
00:35:27.275 --> 00:35:30.975
and also that it rightly preaches the word of God.

660
00:35:32.635 --> 00:35:33.635
Signpost Number two,

661
00:35:33.635 --> 00:35:35.795
what makes a church a church is the practice

662
00:35:35.895 --> 00:35:37.155
of the ordinances.

663
00:35:37.505 --> 00:35:38.725
So what is an ordinance?

664
00:35:40.715 --> 00:35:44.455
An ordinance are things or is a thing that Jesus ordained

665
00:35:44.875 --> 00:35:47.415
or instituted or commanded the church to do.

666
00:35:47.415 --> 00:35:50.375
And he ordered the church to do two things,

667
00:35:51.985 --> 00:35:56.155
baptize and to take the Lord's supper together.

668
00:35:57.535 --> 00:36:01.715
And these ordinances are signs of the gospel made visible

669
00:36:02.425 --> 00:36:05.115
baptism we see as our union

670
00:36:05.335 --> 00:36:07.715
and Christ's death, burial, resurrection,

671
00:36:07.975 --> 00:36:10.275
and the Lord's Supper is our participation in

672
00:36:10.495 --> 00:36:14.595
and remembrance of his broken body and his blood.

673
00:36:15.535 --> 00:36:19.395
And baptism is what we would say is an initiating ordinance.

674
00:36:19.585 --> 00:36:21.075
It's where we publicly profess

675
00:36:22.015 --> 00:36:24.555
and express our fellowship with Christ.

676
00:36:26.735 --> 00:36:27.755
And we see his command

677
00:36:27.755 --> 00:36:29.755
of baptize in Matthew 11, 19 through 20.

678
00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:31.435
You know, this passage, go

679
00:36:31.435 --> 00:36:33.875
therefore make disciples of all nations,

680
00:36:34.065 --> 00:36:37.315
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son,

681
00:36:37.335 --> 00:36:39.035
and of the Holy Spirit teaching them

682
00:36:39.335 --> 00:36:41.075
to observe all that I've commanded you.

683
00:36:41.375 --> 00:36:43.835
And behold, I'm with you always to the end of this age.

684
00:36:45.535 --> 00:36:48.755
We see in scripture that baptism is only for people

685
00:36:49.095 --> 00:36:51.635
who are believers, for those who have been saved.

686
00:36:53.175 --> 00:36:55.595
And we see that saved people should be baptized.

687
00:36:56.295 --> 00:36:57.995
We understand scripture to in instructs

688
00:36:57.995 --> 00:37:02.955
that we only baptize those who as best we can tell,

689
00:37:03.225 --> 00:37:05.595
have been saved again,

690
00:37:05.595 --> 00:37:07.995
who have a credible profession of faith.

691
00:37:09.215 --> 00:37:12.275
And we also believe that this, that since this is a normal

692
00:37:12.835 --> 00:37:16.595
expected initiation step into Christian discipleship,

693
00:37:17.545 --> 00:37:21.475
that church membership is for those who have been baptized.

694
00:37:24.705 --> 00:37:26.805
So part of what makes a church a church is that it is

695
00:37:26.915 --> 00:37:28.205
that it is doxological.

696
00:37:29.385 --> 00:37:31.365
It rightly preaches God's word,

697
00:37:31.545 --> 00:37:35.485
and it regularly practices the ordinances of baptism

698
00:37:36.265 --> 00:37:39.085
and the Lord's Supper signpost.

699
00:37:39.085 --> 00:37:41.325
Number three, what makes a church a church is

700
00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:42.845
that it is Lago centric.

701
00:37:44.075 --> 00:37:47.645
Lago centric, the way John said it on Sunday is that it,

702
00:37:47.645 --> 00:37:48.805
that a church is truth

703
00:37:49.705 --> 00:37:54.205
and Christ based, absolutely a Christian Church,

704
00:37:54.265 --> 00:37:58.085
is necessarily oriented around the truth of Christ,

705
00:37:58.265 --> 00:38:01.485
around his gospel, around the word of God.

706
00:38:01.705 --> 00:38:04.605
And so what do we mean by laga centric?

707
00:38:05.185 --> 00:38:08.605
Or we saw the word doxology earlier, dosa glory

708
00:38:08.745 --> 00:38:12.245
and, uh, loggy speaking or word.

709
00:38:12.505 --> 00:38:17.485
So log Lago centric just means word centered. Word centered.

710
00:38:18.105 --> 00:38:19.725
And when we meet word centered,

711
00:38:20.185 --> 00:38:22.005
we meet it in a couple different senses.

712
00:38:22.105 --> 00:38:26.805
One in which the cr, uh, Christ is the word incarnate,

713
00:38:27.155 --> 00:38:28.365
John one, we see that.

714
00:38:28.745 --> 00:38:32.365
And also the inspired word of God, scripture,

715
00:38:32.505 --> 00:38:35.245
we see in scripture that Christ is the

716
00:38:35.315 --> 00:38:37.245
cornerstone of the church.

717
00:38:39.155 --> 00:38:42.415
You remember the scene in Acts, acts four, when Peter

718
00:38:42.475 --> 00:38:44.775
and John are arrested, they're put

719
00:38:44.775 --> 00:38:46.815
before the Sanhedrin council.

720
00:38:47.235 --> 00:38:50.535
And Peter boldly proclaims to this council.

721
00:38:50.715 --> 00:38:55.495
He says, so boldly says this, Jesus is the stone

722
00:38:56.565 --> 00:38:58.775
that was rejected by you, the builders,

723
00:38:58.985 --> 00:39:01.775
which has become the cornerstone.

724
00:39:04.365 --> 00:39:06.505
And there is salvation in no one else.

725
00:39:07.365 --> 00:39:10.305
And there is no other name under heaven given among men

726
00:39:10.305 --> 00:39:11.985
by which we must be saved.

727
00:39:14.025 --> 00:39:17.005
If Jesus is the cornerstone of the church,

728
00:39:17.825 --> 00:39:22.005
if he grounded it, if he created it, if he was foundational

729
00:39:22.505 --> 00:39:26.405
for it, Matthew 16, he says, I will build my church

730
00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:28.485
if he's all of that.

731
00:39:28.505 --> 00:39:31.765
If there is salvation under no other name under heaven,

732
00:39:32.835 --> 00:39:36.605
then it makes sense that we would be Christ centered,

733
00:39:38.055 --> 00:39:39.865
that we would be gospel centered,

734
00:39:39.975 --> 00:39:42.185
that we would be word centered.

735
00:39:43.755 --> 00:39:45.655
So part of what makes a church a church is

736
00:39:45.655 --> 00:39:47.375
that it is doxological.

737
00:39:48.075 --> 00:39:52.135
It rightly preaches God's word. It practices the ordinances.

738
00:39:52.835 --> 00:39:54.775
And it is logo centric.

739
00:39:55.115 --> 00:40:00.095
It is word centric signpost number four,

740
00:40:00.105 --> 00:40:01.535
we've already talked some about this,

741
00:40:01.555 --> 00:40:04.055
so I won't belabor this one too much.

742
00:40:04.115 --> 00:40:07.215
But what makes a church a church is that there is

743
00:40:07.825 --> 00:40:11.375
meaningful membership, meaningful membership,

744
00:40:12.815 --> 00:40:15.835
not a weak membership that gives false assurance

745
00:40:15.855 --> 00:40:17.915
of salvation to people within the church.

746
00:40:18.025 --> 00:40:19.075
It's a dangerous thing.

747
00:40:19.455 --> 00:40:22.395
But we see church membership as a vital expression

748
00:40:22.735 --> 00:40:27.075
of a believer's commitment to a local body of believers.

749
00:40:27.095 --> 00:40:30.595
And so we see this as a biblical model

750
00:40:31.265 --> 00:40:35.875
that is an identifiable covenantal community

751
00:40:35.875 --> 00:40:37.035
within our church.

752
00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:39.495
And we saw this earlier,

753
00:40:40.435 --> 00:40:44.095
but you being a member have a commitment

754
00:40:44.915 --> 00:40:48.615
to the church, as the church does to you.

755
00:40:49.755 --> 00:40:53.815
And all of this is designed to foster accountability,

756
00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:58.575
discipline, pastoral care illustrates a testimony of faith

757
00:40:58.715 --> 00:41:03.095
to an unbelieving world that so desperately needs Jesus.

758
00:41:04.315 --> 00:41:07.055
So part of what makes a church is that it is doxological

759
00:41:08.005 --> 00:41:09.535
rightly preaches God's word.

760
00:41:09.555 --> 00:41:10.975
It practices the ordinances.

761
00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:15.455
It is logo centric, and it has meaningful membership.

762
00:41:16.725 --> 00:41:19.745
The last signpost we'll talk about we heard on Sunday is

763
00:41:19.745 --> 00:41:20.785
that the church is sent.

764
00:41:21.605 --> 00:41:24.825
The church is sent. We are on mission.

765
00:41:25.005 --> 00:41:29.785
We are evangelistic stick. Matthew 28, 19 through 20.

766
00:41:31.035 --> 00:41:35.565
We've already read this, but we are to go make disciples

767
00:41:35.565 --> 00:41:37.205
of all nations.

768
00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:41.005
John 20 says, as the Father has sent me, so I'm sending you,

769
00:41:41.745 --> 00:41:44.285
and this is what we mean by living sent.

770
00:41:44.385 --> 00:41:48.165
We have been instructed by God himself, by Christ himself,

771
00:41:48.165 --> 00:41:51.125
to go and make disciples of all nations

772
00:41:51.185 --> 00:41:54.485
to be witnesses locally and globally.

773
00:41:55.995 --> 00:42:00.395
So I am thankful for this community of believers, this,

774
00:42:00.745 --> 00:42:02.515
this church of Jesus Christ

775
00:42:02.545 --> 00:42:06.875
that he has providentially planted me and my family in.

776
00:42:07.695 --> 00:42:08.715
I'm thankful for you.

777
00:42:10.615 --> 00:42:13.925
You know, there's, in these 15 years,

778
00:42:14.975 --> 00:42:17.005
there have been tough things that we've walked

779
00:42:17.005 --> 00:42:19.925
through my family, and I cannot imagine

780
00:42:21.155 --> 00:42:23.705
life without you.

781
00:42:33.125 --> 00:42:34.665
So as I've worked through this,

782
00:42:37.745 --> 00:42:39.925
I'm reminded of the incredible privilege

783
00:42:41.715 --> 00:42:44.695
and the responsibility that we hold as members of

784
00:42:45.285 --> 00:42:47.895
this body, Henderson Hills.

785
00:42:48.955 --> 00:42:52.135
We are not just brought together by shared belief,

786
00:42:52.135 --> 00:42:56.335
but by God himself to reflect his glory.

787
00:42:57.525 --> 00:42:59.095
What makes a church a church?

788
00:42:59.755 --> 00:43:01.335
It upholds the glory of God

789
00:43:01.335 --> 00:43:03.095
through the preaching of his word.

790
00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:05.135
It's demonstrated through his ordinances.

791
00:43:05.395 --> 00:43:08.615
It radiates outward through his mission in the world.

792
00:43:08.755 --> 00:43:11.015
And we have a part of that praise God.

793
00:43:13.635 --> 00:43:15.255
The church is to be a pillar

794
00:43:15.555 --> 00:43:19.895
and a buttress of the truth in a world that needs it,

795
00:43:21.915 --> 00:43:22.935
it needs the gospel.

796
00:43:23.195 --> 00:43:24.615
It needs to be saved.

797
00:43:26.865 --> 00:43:29.165
So I'll close with this passage from Hebrews

798
00:43:29.305 --> 00:43:32.355
10 23 to 25.

799
00:43:32.355 --> 00:43:35.715
Excuse me. Let us hold fast.

800
00:43:36.135 --> 00:43:40.395
The confession of our hope without wavering for he

801
00:43:40.455 --> 00:43:42.235
who promised is faithful.

802
00:43:43.925 --> 00:43:46.905
And let us consider how to stir up one another to love

803
00:43:47.125 --> 00:43:50.665
and good works, not neg, not neglecting to meet together

804
00:43:50.925 --> 00:43:54.625
as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another

805
00:43:55.595 --> 00:43:59.535
and all the more as you see the day drawing near.

806
00:44:01.365 --> 00:44:05.425
Praise God. Well, now this is the moment of the,

807
00:44:05.965 --> 00:44:08.665
of our night together where we get to field q and a.

808
00:44:08.805 --> 00:44:12.745
If you're so interested to ask any questions, the, the, uh,

809
00:44:12.795 --> 00:44:14.585
it'll have my brothers come up here.

810
00:44:14.925 --> 00:44:17.585
Uh, Joe and Aaron, they're gonna help me tonight.

811
00:44:18.725 --> 00:44:20.265
Um, but this gives you an opportunity.

812
00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:22.425
The, the doctrine of the church

813
00:44:23.665 --> 00:44:27.465
ecclesiology is an incredibly dipped, uh, uh,

814
00:44:27.495 --> 00:44:28.825
deep doctrine.

815
00:44:29.885 --> 00:44:34.565
And, uh, so you may have an infinite number of questions.

816
00:44:34.585 --> 00:44:37.045
We, we'd love to answer your questions if you have them.

817
00:44:38.705 --> 00:44:41.895
We have two mics set up if you'd like.

818
00:44:43.345 --> 00:44:45.805
And, uh, if we have nobody, we have some questions

819
00:44:45.805 --> 00:44:47.285
that we could, we ask each other.

820
00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:57.725
Thanks, Ryan. Thanks Ryan.

821
00:44:57.955 --> 00:44:59.485
Yeah, thank you, Joe.

822
00:45:00.465 --> 00:45:03.125
I'm so honored to sit where John Calvin used to sit.

823
00:45:04.355 --> 00:45:05.605
Yeah, it's Unbelievable.

824
00:45:05.665 --> 00:45:07.285
Or is this Martin Luther? Yeah,

825
00:45:07.555 --> 00:45:08.555
This is Luther. Oh, this

826
00:45:08.555 --> 00:45:10.805
is Luther. This here. Well, at least we have two

827
00:45:10.805 --> 00:45:11.805
Smart people up here.

828
00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.485
Yes. Okay. I have a quick question

829
00:45:16.545 --> 00:45:18.125
and I haven't really developed it fully.

830
00:45:18.345 --> 00:45:23.045
So can you kind of expound on

831
00:45:23.795 --> 00:45:27.205
expo expositional preaching?

832
00:45:28.195 --> 00:45:32.685
Because what I heard was it just takes the verse

833
00:45:33.225 --> 00:45:34.485
and kind of unpacks it.

834
00:45:34.905 --> 00:45:38.485
And so how do you guard against taking it out of context?

835
00:45:38.795 --> 00:45:43.325
Because I mean, even secular society takes verses

836
00:45:43.385 --> 00:45:46.885
and just uses it for their own benefit when they just used

837
00:45:46.885 --> 00:45:49.565
that verse instead of looking at the whole

838
00:45:50.465 --> 00:45:52.765
why it was written and who it was written to

839
00:45:52.905 --> 00:45:54.085
and what was going on at the time.

840
00:45:54.305 --> 00:45:57.045
So could you explain, kind

841
00:45:57.045 --> 00:45:58.165
of explain that a little bit more?

842
00:45:59.355 --> 00:46:03.005
Yeah. We left you what, what's your name? Sorry. It's

843
00:46:03.005 --> 00:46:04.005
Okay. Susan Bain.

844
00:46:04.375 --> 00:46:05.765
Susan, thank you for your question.

845
00:46:05.785 --> 00:46:07.085
That's a really good question.

846
00:46:07.185 --> 00:46:08.285
So, uh,

847
00:46:09.105 --> 00:46:12.525
so let's talk about expositional expository preaching.

848
00:46:12.525 --> 00:46:14.045
What is it? What, what is that?

849
00:46:14.305 --> 00:46:19.165
Um, uh, what I've come to understand as it relates

850
00:46:19.165 --> 00:46:20.565
to expository preaching,

851
00:46:20.565 --> 00:46:22.485
these guys can speak into it better than I can,

852
00:46:22.585 --> 00:46:23.645
but what, what I've come

853
00:46:23.645 --> 00:46:27.045
to learn about expository preaching is everybody has their

854
00:46:27.045 --> 00:46:28.645
own view of it.

855
00:46:29.585 --> 00:46:32.565
And so, um, the way that I see it

856
00:46:33.265 --> 00:46:36.645
is expository preaching is understanding.

857
00:46:37.785 --> 00:46:42.005
Uh, a phrase that I've heard is that you,

858
00:46:42.145 --> 00:46:44.245
you bleed over the passage.

859
00:46:44.505 --> 00:46:46.925
You pour out your heart and your soul. You seek God.

860
00:46:46.945 --> 00:46:49.765
You pray, God show, show me Holy Spirit,

861
00:46:49.765 --> 00:46:52.725
illuminate this passage to me as you're studying

862
00:46:52.945 --> 00:46:54.525
to preach this passage.

863
00:46:54.705 --> 00:46:56.325
And so, uh, everything

864
00:46:56.325 --> 00:46:58.245
that you do in your preparation is toward

865
00:46:58.245 --> 00:46:59.285
understanding the context.

866
00:46:59.595 --> 00:47:01.085
What is the original audience?

867
00:47:01.085 --> 00:47:02.805
What is the historical context?

868
00:47:02.805 --> 00:47:06.925
Understanding the whole of the, of the chapter, the whole

869
00:47:07.025 --> 00:47:09.325
of the book, the whole of the Bible.

870
00:47:09.395 --> 00:47:12.285
There's biblical theology, which is a study

871
00:47:12.345 --> 00:47:16.165
of the whole narrative theology of all of scripture.

872
00:47:16.305 --> 00:47:18.405
How does this, how does this passage

873
00:47:19.905 --> 00:47:22.005
fit into all of scripture?

874
00:47:23.345 --> 00:47:27.485
And, uh, you do your best to find what is the main point

875
00:47:27.505 --> 00:47:30.565
of this passage, given everything that you see there.

876
00:47:31.665 --> 00:47:35.905
And so you pour over it by the spirit's, help, um,

877
00:47:36.285 --> 00:47:37.665
to try and understand those things.

878
00:47:37.765 --> 00:47:41.545
You know, at Charles Simeon Trust, uh, is a workshop

879
00:47:41.545 --> 00:47:42.625
that many of us have done.

880
00:47:43.045 --> 00:47:45.025
And in that workshop, it teaches you

881
00:47:45.025 --> 00:47:46.705
to find the line of scripture.

882
00:47:47.725 --> 00:47:50.305
And when you find the line of scripture, you're finding the,

883
00:47:50.365 --> 00:47:52.625
the gold vein that runs

884
00:47:52.625 --> 00:47:54.545
through the passage you're looking at.

885
00:47:55.685 --> 00:47:56.785
And you stick to that.

886
00:47:58.115 --> 00:48:00.615
And you, you, you, you preach it to other people

887
00:48:00.915 --> 00:48:02.975
and you say, am I sticking to that line of scripture,

888
00:48:02.975 --> 00:48:05.415
that gold vein of scripture?

889
00:48:06.875 --> 00:48:08.535
So there, there's a lot of things that you can do there.

890
00:48:08.535 --> 00:48:10.975
These, these guys can speak more into that certainly,

891
00:48:11.275 --> 00:48:14.815
but that's, that's what we're all keeping our minds tuned to

892
00:48:14.915 --> 00:48:16.895
as we're trying to be faithful to his word.

893
00:48:18.495 --> 00:48:20.655
I would just say that, uh, I think simply

894
00:48:21.175 --> 00:48:23.655
expositional preaching is exposing

895
00:48:25.155 --> 00:48:26.575
the meaning of the passage.

896
00:48:27.425 --> 00:48:30.575
Again, in context, really loved what you said,

897
00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:35.455
but, uh, think of it as exposing what God has for us in

898
00:48:35.455 --> 00:48:39.295
that passage in the context of what was meant

899
00:48:40.685 --> 00:48:42.625
to the people for whom it was written.

900
00:48:43.705 --> 00:48:46.135
Aaron can probably get a little more detailed on that.

901
00:48:46.515 --> 00:48:47.535
No, that's well said.

902
00:48:47.755 --> 00:48:52.095
And a lot of pastors will bring their own opinions,

903
00:48:52.095 --> 00:48:55.815
their own preferences, their own, uh, ideas

904
00:48:56.995 --> 00:48:59.255
to the scripture and try to twist it

905
00:48:59.255 --> 00:49:03.255
and make it fit what they want, the narrative they want to,

906
00:49:03.875 --> 00:49:06.295
to, to preach versus expository.

907
00:49:07.935 --> 00:49:11.675
We wanna allow the scriptures to drive the message.

908
00:49:12.095 --> 00:49:16.515
And so we filter all of our thoughts and opinions

909
00:49:16.515 --> 00:49:19.155
and preferences through the scriptures rather than the other

910
00:49:19.155 --> 00:49:20.755
way around filtering the scriptures

911
00:49:21.185 --> 00:49:22.955
through our thoughts and opinions.

912
00:49:22.955 --> 00:49:26.475
So expository, again, allowing the, the heart

913
00:49:26.475 --> 00:49:28.515
of the message, the, the, the passage

914
00:49:28.735 --> 00:49:30.355
to be the message that goes out.

915
00:49:30.715 --> 00:49:32.355
I think Ryan said it really well.

916
00:49:33.665 --> 00:49:36.385
Good question. Thank you. And it's interesting

917
00:49:36.385 --> 00:49:39.955
because there is a, uh, a distinction

918
00:49:39.955 --> 00:49:44.315
because, um, when we preach about something like salvation,

919
00:49:44.535 --> 00:49:49.345
that's winds up being a topical, uh, subject to preach on.

920
00:49:49.405 --> 00:49:53.425
So there are times when you do, uh, preach topically, uh,

921
00:49:53.485 --> 00:49:56.745
but you still have to be true to the golden vein,

922
00:49:56.765 --> 00:50:00.145
if you will, uh, in the storyline of scripture, uh,

923
00:50:00.155 --> 00:50:03.425
systematic theology is by definition topical.

924
00:50:04.045 --> 00:50:07.605
So we're not saying that topical is bad, uh,

925
00:50:07.825 --> 00:50:11.645
but, uh, deep dive expositionally into a passage, uh,

926
00:50:12.025 --> 00:50:13.085
is what we prefer.

927
00:50:13.885 --> 00:50:16.915
Yeah, good question. Good question.

928
00:50:18.795 --> 00:50:19.925
Knee. How,

929
00:50:20.145 --> 00:50:21.145
Hi. Um,

930
00:50:21.145 --> 00:50:23.845
so I come from a charismatic church.

931
00:50:24.675 --> 00:50:26.565
I've only been a Baptist for about five years.

932
00:50:27.465 --> 00:50:28.805
So I guess my question is,

933
00:50:29.155 --> 00:50:32.885
when I'm having these conversations with my family, I mean,

934
00:50:33.185 --> 00:50:36.565
we believe in the big rocks, which is revelation, salvation,

935
00:50:36.665 --> 00:50:39.285
the trinity, all of the stuff that we spoke about,

936
00:50:39.745 --> 00:50:43.125
but some of these little rocks we go back and forth on.

937
00:50:43.345 --> 00:50:45.565
An example is when John said last week

938
00:50:45.565 --> 00:50:47.165
that some churches believe

939
00:50:47.165 --> 00:50:48.565
that one should become a believer.

940
00:50:49.345 --> 00:50:51.245
You get baptized with the Holy Spirit

941
00:50:51.345 --> 00:50:53.005
and everybody speaks in tongues.

942
00:50:53.425 --> 00:50:56.565
Whilst we in Henderson Hills believe that it's a gift

943
00:50:56.905 --> 00:50:58.365
and some people can speak in it.

944
00:50:58.705 --> 00:51:01.165
So I guess my question is, what should be the goal

945
00:51:01.385 --> 00:51:02.605
of these conversations?

946
00:51:03.145 --> 00:51:07.325
Should a goal be to win them over to become Baptist?

947
00:51:07.665 --> 00:51:09.205
Or we should just agree

948
00:51:09.205 --> 00:51:11.405
to disagree when we have these conversations?

949
00:51:11.415 --> 00:51:12.415
Thank you,

950
00:51:14.185 --> 00:51:15.365
Nee, that's a great question.

951
00:51:15.545 --> 00:51:18.445
So what, uh, as it relates to secondary,

952
00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:22.405
secondary issues within the church and,

953
00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:25.925
and, uh, when we're talking to people that we love, uh,

954
00:51:25.945 --> 00:51:29.485
is our goal to win them over, uh, what is the goal there?

955
00:51:30.025 --> 00:51:31.325
And that's the question.

956
00:51:32.345 --> 00:51:36.845
Um, I will, I will say from a personal story standpoint,

957
00:51:37.745 --> 00:51:40.405
my, my parents, both my dad

958
00:51:40.585 --> 00:51:44.805
and my mom met in seventh grade in Ecuador as,

959
00:51:45.105 --> 00:51:46.285
uh, missionary kids.

960
00:51:47.865 --> 00:51:51.885
And, um, I won't say the, the, the denomination they went

961
00:51:51.885 --> 00:51:54.165
with, and it could have been the people

962
00:51:54.315 --> 00:51:55.605
that they were there with.

963
00:51:56.025 --> 00:52:00.405
But because my mom as a third grader, as a fourth grader,

964
00:52:00.405 --> 00:52:03.405
as a fifth grader, sixth grader, as she was there, uh,

965
00:52:03.585 --> 00:52:06.365
was tremendously hurt by

966
00:52:08.855 --> 00:52:13.515
people arguing for the secondary issues,

967
00:52:14.145 --> 00:52:16.835
like speaking in tongues like you just mentioned me.

968
00:52:17.025 --> 00:52:18.595
It's a really good example

969
00:52:19.825 --> 00:52:23.955
because they believed my mom

970
00:52:24.135 --> 00:52:28.195
to not be a Christian because she didn't speak in tongues.

971
00:52:29.405 --> 00:52:31.705
So she was incredibly hurt

972
00:52:31.725 --> 00:52:33.545
by the church at that point in time.

973
00:52:34.365 --> 00:52:38.025
And so, uh, certainly we don't want to use secondary issues

974
00:52:38.125 --> 00:52:39.665
to, to bludgeon other people

975
00:52:39.805 --> 00:52:41.905
and to hurt people and things like that.

976
00:52:41.965 --> 00:52:45.865
So what is the goal as we discuss secondary issues?

977
00:52:46.805 --> 00:52:50.625
Um, I think the goal would be toward

978
00:52:51.425 --> 00:52:52.585
unity, certainly.

979
00:52:52.885 --> 00:52:56.665
Uh, and then, and then also toward, you know,

980
00:52:56.665 --> 00:53:00.625
as illuminating as much that we see in scripture as possible

981
00:53:00.735 --> 00:53:02.305
with these other believers.

982
00:53:02.405 --> 00:53:05.425
But it's, it's not anything that I think that we should

983
00:53:06.245 --> 00:53:07.865
hit them over the head with, right?

984
00:53:07.865 --> 00:53:09.985
There's, there's a gentleness aspect to it.

985
00:53:09.985 --> 00:53:12.825
There's a humility, a gentleness, patience.

986
00:53:12.845 --> 00:53:14.545
We bear with them. Uh,

987
00:53:14.545 --> 00:53:15.985
we bear with the failings of the weak.

988
00:53:15.985 --> 00:53:19.345
If we, if we see it as a failing of, of, of on their part,

989
00:53:19.455 --> 00:53:22.505
that, that, uh, they don't see scripture

990
00:53:23.455 --> 00:53:24.545
that seems to be clear.

991
00:53:24.805 --> 00:53:26.765
Uh, we, we bear with them in that.

992
00:53:27.265 --> 00:53:28.325
That's, that's what I would say.

993
00:53:28.325 --> 00:53:29.365
I don't know if you guys have

994
00:53:29.605 --> 00:53:30.725
anything additional to say about that.

995
00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:34.445
Great answer. Yeah, I would agree.

996
00:53:34.755 --> 00:53:39.685
Tolerance is bearing with their belief

997
00:53:41.345 --> 00:53:43.845
if they can, if they love the Lord Jesus Christ.

998
00:53:44.305 --> 00:53:48.365
And salvation is, is the primary

999
00:53:49.565 --> 00:53:50.965
unifying factor there.

1000
00:53:51.635 --> 00:53:53.125
There's those second tier issues.

1001
00:53:53.225 --> 00:53:56.165
We can agree to disagree on a lot of those and, and,

1002
00:53:57.185 --> 00:54:00.325
and still walk together in unity in some ways.

1003
00:54:00.795 --> 00:54:03.325
Yeah, I think that's again, the key, uh,

1004
00:54:04.155 --> 00:54:07.545
agree on the big rocks, the secondary issues, uh,

1005
00:54:07.575 --> 00:54:10.065
walk alongside them, uh, love them.

1006
00:54:10.725 --> 00:54:12.345
Uh, explain where you're at,

1007
00:54:12.485 --> 00:54:16.705
but don't let it divide you, uh, in your fellowship,

1008
00:54:16.765 --> 00:54:20.785
in your, in your walk with Christ.

1009
00:54:20.795 --> 00:54:23.425
Don't let it become, uh, a barrier

1010
00:54:23.965 --> 00:54:25.225
to your fellowship in Christ.

1011
00:54:25.365 --> 00:54:29.185
Now, as you get, uh, further into it

1012
00:54:29.245 --> 00:54:31.345
and as you determine how you worship,

1013
00:54:31.595 --> 00:54:32.865
those do become important.

1014
00:54:33.185 --> 00:54:35.065
'cause that, that's what we're talking about, ecclesiology.

1015
00:54:35.065 --> 00:54:36.865
They're, they're, they're secondary,

1016
00:54:36.965 --> 00:54:37.985
but they're also important.

1017
00:54:39.765 --> 00:54:41.985
But don't let it diminish your love for that person.

1018
00:54:42.365 --> 00:54:44.825
So I think tolerance was a great point.

1019
00:54:46.095 --> 00:54:49.895
Yeah. Again, as a spoiler for Sunday, we're,

1020
00:54:49.895 --> 00:54:52.695
we're talking about reformed theology on Sunday, which I,

1021
00:54:52.705 --> 00:54:55.495
which I would probably say is one of the most divisive

1022
00:54:56.115 --> 00:54:57.335
of the secondary issues.

1023
00:54:57.595 --> 00:55:00.495
Um, and so that's another area where people need

1024
00:55:00.495 --> 00:55:03.615
to understand to be, uh, humble in their approach

1025
00:55:03.635 --> 00:55:05.095
and gentle in their approach.

1026
00:55:05.505 --> 00:55:10.455
Oftentimes the, the two, the two dominant camps,

1027
00:55:10.455 --> 00:55:14.095
there can be pretty, uh, heels in the ground

1028
00:55:15.035 --> 00:55:17.655
and, uh, that that's hurtful to the witness

1029
00:55:18.035 --> 00:55:19.815
of Christ to other people.

1030
00:55:21.075 --> 00:55:22.295
So, any other questions?

1031
00:55:29.005 --> 00:55:30.665
Got a question. Um,

1032
00:55:30.805 --> 00:55:34.025
so all my life I've grown up in a church that is led

1033
00:55:34.025 --> 00:55:35.065
by just one man

1034
00:55:35.445 --> 00:55:37.025
and coming to Henderson Hills

1035
00:55:37.025 --> 00:55:39.025
where it's being led by elders.

1036
00:55:39.605 --> 00:55:41.145
So I know with the one month church,

1037
00:55:41.145 --> 00:55:44.465
usually he has the final say, and then he does everything.

1038
00:55:45.045 --> 00:55:49.345
Can you just shed a little light on some of the struggles

1039
00:55:49.375 --> 00:55:52.425
that comes with, I mean, I know it's not perfect,

1040
00:55:52.485 --> 00:55:54.025
but like being an elder led church,

1041
00:55:54.135 --> 00:55:57.265
when you guys disagree on stuff, how do you come to that,

1042
00:55:57.925 --> 00:55:59.585
uh, consensus or like agreement?

1043
00:55:59.585 --> 00:56:02.825
Because I know there's no one person who has the finances.

1044
00:56:02.825 --> 00:56:04.425
So how do you kinda like,

1045
00:56:04.425 --> 00:56:06.265
resolve when there's disagreements there?

1046
00:56:07.745 --> 00:56:10.485
That's a good question. So question is

1047
00:56:12.065 --> 00:56:15.725
senior pastor led churches, there's one decision maker,

1048
00:56:16.655 --> 00:56:20.565
elder led churches, elder rule churches, in some cases, uh,

1049
00:56:21.305 --> 00:56:24.765
uh, decisions are made by a plurality of elders.

1050
00:56:24.765 --> 00:56:26.485
So how does that look like in practice?

1051
00:56:27.025 --> 00:56:30.965
And, um, I've only been a part of the council for two years,

1052
00:56:31.905 --> 00:56:35.565
um, so I can only share a sliver of my view into that.

1053
00:56:35.665 --> 00:56:39.485
But, uh, what I've, what I've really appreciated in

1054
00:56:40.055 --> 00:56:43.325
witnessing these brothers on the council,

1055
00:56:43.505 --> 00:56:47.005
and I've learned so much from them, is we,

1056
00:56:47.065 --> 00:56:48.245
we talk about it all the time.

1057
00:56:48.395 --> 00:56:51.485
This Ephesians four, humility and gentleness and patience.

1058
00:56:51.555 --> 00:56:55.605
There's a, there's a, a deference, there's a, there's a,

1059
00:56:56.165 --> 00:57:00.285
a revered, there's a respect among the council,

1060
00:57:00.415 --> 00:57:03.245
among the other elders that

1061
00:57:04.045 --> 00:57:05.845
respects differing viewpoints

1062
00:57:06.635 --> 00:57:09.285
that lets differing viewpoints come up.

1063
00:57:10.465 --> 00:57:12.805
And, uh, we decide together.

1064
00:57:13.065 --> 00:57:14.485
In some cases we vote

1065
00:57:15.065 --> 00:57:18.165
and, uh, somebody says, well, I think A and,

1066
00:57:18.225 --> 00:57:20.165
and the rest say B.

1067
00:57:21.065 --> 00:57:22.765
And, uh, we decide differently.

1068
00:57:22.785 --> 00:57:27.285
But when we vote, we walk outta that room, uh,

1069
00:57:27.495 --> 00:57:30.485
every time we walk outta that room in unity,

1070
00:57:31.235 --> 00:57:32.645
singing the same tune.

1071
00:57:34.265 --> 00:57:37.885
And so, uh, coming to decisions is naturally,

1072
00:57:37.945 --> 00:57:41.005
as you would expect among, among a plurality of elders,

1073
00:57:41.125 --> 00:57:44.285
a slower thing than if it was a senior pastor

1074
00:57:44.395 --> 00:57:45.645
just making a decision.

1075
00:57:46.275 --> 00:57:47.685
It's a slower thing, but,

1076
00:57:47.985 --> 00:57:50.125
but we would say that it's a God ordained,

1077
00:57:51.035 --> 00:57:52.085
slowing mechanism.

1078
00:57:52.745 --> 00:57:55.325
If he didn't, if he didn't want the church to be led

1079
00:57:55.565 --> 00:57:58.645
by plurality of elders, he wouldn't have in scripture.

1080
00:57:58.935 --> 00:58:03.085
Every single time he mentions, um, church leadership,

1081
00:58:03.155 --> 00:58:05.405
it's always in the plural, right?

1082
00:58:05.425 --> 00:58:08.645
And so I think that it, that it is a slowing mechanism

1083
00:58:09.225 --> 00:58:12.485
is a means it is a divine slowing mechanism.

1084
00:58:12.545 --> 00:58:14.965
It kind of keeps tempers in check

1085
00:58:15.145 --> 00:58:19.125
and keeps, uh, keeps things oriented toward wisdom.

1086
00:58:21.305 --> 00:58:23.125
Uh, yeah, I would just say that, uh,

1087
00:58:23.915 --> 00:58:26.565
many times we've gone in with an opinion about

1088
00:58:26.565 --> 00:58:30.845
what should happen, but as we, uh, defer to the others,

1089
00:58:31.905 --> 00:58:36.005
uh, what happens is, is we believe, uh,

1090
00:58:36.955 --> 00:58:41.045
that, uh, the Holy Spirit leads us to, uh,

1091
00:58:41.395 --> 00:58:44.445
what his preference would be on a particular issue.

1092
00:58:45.065 --> 00:58:48.165
And, uh, very often it's, uh, not similar

1093
00:58:48.185 --> 00:58:49.605
to anybody's in particular,

1094
00:58:50.185 --> 00:58:52.045
or not, not perfect line up

1095
00:58:52.155 --> 00:58:54.805
with anybody's particular idea as they went in.

1096
00:58:55.085 --> 00:58:58.365
I think that's the value of the plurality of elders is, um,

1097
00:58:59.205 --> 00:59:02.825
having many counselors, uh, bring wiser decisions,

1098
00:59:02.935 --> 00:59:05.695
even if they're a bit slower, we believe,

1099
00:59:08.295 --> 00:59:10.175
I thought you were gonna say we never disagree.

1100
00:59:11.415 --> 00:59:15.055
I did not say that. That's

1101
00:59:15.055 --> 00:59:16.055
A good answer. Yeah. In

1102
00:59:16.055 --> 00:59:18.495
Acts 15, it talks about this idea of it,

1103
00:59:18.675 --> 00:59:22.085
it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us.

1104
00:59:22.145 --> 00:59:24.485
And so there's this idea of what Joe is speaking of,

1105
00:59:24.485 --> 00:59:26.805
that we're, we're seeking the Lord, we're asking the,

1106
00:59:26.825 --> 00:59:29.965
the Spirit to, um, to show us.

1107
00:59:31.345 --> 00:59:35.205
And so we, we eagerly seek, seek his wisdom

1108
00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:36.765
as we make decisions.

1109
00:59:39.675 --> 00:59:42.285
Believe it or not, elders have blind spots.

1110
00:59:42.585 --> 00:59:44.125
And when there's more than one,

1111
00:59:44.125 --> 00:59:46.965
sometimes the blind spots get, can get exposed.

1112
00:59:47.785 --> 00:59:50.125
And as we come together humbly,

1113
00:59:50.425 --> 00:59:52.805
we can hopefully find the best, best solution.

1114
00:59:58.615 --> 01:00:00.625
Okay. Ryan, I had a quick question.

1115
01:00:00.685 --> 01:00:02.545
You didn't ask this at the very first,

1116
01:00:02.685 --> 01:00:04.585
but I grew up Methodist.

1117
01:00:04.895 --> 01:00:09.225
Okay. And, um, you know, when I was saved, I was sprinkled.

1118
01:00:09.685 --> 01:00:14.385
And when I got to, um, college, I started, uh,

1119
01:00:14.385 --> 01:00:16.065
attending a Baptist church

1120
01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:20.465
and I realized that I needed to follow Christ example

1121
01:00:20.685 --> 01:00:22.505
and, um, be immersed.

1122
01:00:23.005 --> 01:00:27.385
And, um, it, um, when we have our,

1123
01:00:27.605 --> 01:00:30.425
the Lord's Supper, it used to be that I know that they

1124
01:00:31.235 --> 01:00:34.185
would say, if you have been baptized,

1125
01:00:34.445 --> 01:00:36.385
you can take the Lord's Supper.

1126
01:00:36.505 --> 01:00:38.305
And I haven't really heard that lately,

1127
01:00:38.805 --> 01:00:42.945
and I didn't know if that was, uh, something that our church

1128
01:00:43.985 --> 01:00:46.305
observed that you needed to be baptized

1129
01:00:46.485 --> 01:00:48.425
before you took the Lord's Supper.

1130
01:00:48.725 --> 01:00:49.725
So that's,

1131
01:00:50.715 --> 01:00:51.715
That's a good question.

1132
01:00:51.795 --> 01:00:53.015
I'm sorry, what's your name? I can't,

1133
01:00:53.095 --> 01:00:55.615
I can't see very well at all. I apologize.

1134
01:00:55.755 --> 01:00:57.135
Um, uh, Laurie Cunningham.

1135
01:00:57.475 --> 01:00:59.815
Laurie. Uh, well, thank you, Laurie. Appreciate that.

1136
01:01:01.595 --> 01:01:05.975
Um, I could maybe speak into this some, uh, again,

1137
01:01:06.115 --> 01:01:10.855
as we talk about the ordinances that, that Jesus

1138
01:01:11.365 --> 01:01:14.055
gave us, uh, we see baptism

1139
01:01:14.115 --> 01:01:16.295
and we see, um, the Lord's Supper.

1140
01:01:17.705 --> 01:01:20.805
And so the, the question is,

1141
01:01:22.705 --> 01:01:26.005
can you take the Lord's supper without having been baptized?

1142
01:01:26.065 --> 01:01:28.765
Or is that, is that something that we would support?

1143
01:01:29.065 --> 01:01:32.885
Is that a good, good recap of the, of the question? Okay.

1144
01:01:33.425 --> 01:01:37.525
Uh, the way that we talk about baptism is, again, it's kind

1145
01:01:37.525 --> 01:01:40.765
of like this, this initiating ordinance.

1146
01:01:40.835 --> 01:01:44.125
It's this, it's this sign that we are now a part

1147
01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:45.365
of the body of Christ.

1148
01:01:45.945 --> 01:01:49.205
And so then the, the Lord's Supper ends up being described

1149
01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:53.205
as this continuing, this continuing ordinance that says,

1150
01:01:53.545 --> 01:01:57.845
we are in fellowship with Christ, with other believers,

1151
01:01:58.505 --> 01:01:59.765
uh, in this church.

1152
01:02:00.905 --> 01:02:04.965
And so, uh, to me, I, I, I think that we, I think

1153
01:02:04.965 --> 01:02:08.285
that we understand it to be, you need to be

1154
01:02:09.565 --> 01:02:12.885
a baptized believer to partake in the, in the Lord's supper.

1155
01:02:13.085 --> 01:02:15.645
I, I could be wrong. Am I wrong, Joe?

1156
01:02:16.985 --> 01:02:18.205
Uh, you're not wrong.

1157
01:02:19.105 --> 01:02:22.125
Uh, I, I think the way that it's been characterized,

1158
01:02:22.145 --> 01:02:26.805
and as you can see, we don't necessarily always agree,

1159
01:02:26.805 --> 01:02:28.445
even though we love and respect each other.

1160
01:02:29.065 --> 01:02:33.815
Uh, and we did say that at one time, uh,

1161
01:02:34.405 --> 01:02:36.015
from the, from the platform.

1162
01:02:36.015 --> 01:02:39.135
And one of the things that we value is, uh,

1163
01:02:39.235 --> 01:02:41.575
we call it simple, simple referenda.

1164
01:02:41.575 --> 01:02:43.375
And that is, as we dig deeper,

1165
01:02:44.755 --> 01:02:47.505
uh, we learn more.

1166
01:02:48.445 --> 01:02:50.105
Uh, so, uh,

1167
01:02:54.315 --> 01:02:57.375
we, and and again, it's just, it's another perspective,

1168
01:02:57.595 --> 01:03:00.415
but where we are today is we don't say

1169
01:03:00.925 --> 01:03:04.415
that only baptized believers can come to the,

1170
01:03:04.435 --> 01:03:05.895
to the Lord's table table.

1171
01:03:06.635 --> 01:03:11.255
Um, by definition, baptism will come, should come

1172
01:03:11.265 --> 01:03:15.255
after salvation, and it is initiatory, but,

1173
01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:18.095
and it is a, uh,

1174
01:03:19.075 --> 01:03:21.295
an act which shows your, uh,

1175
01:03:21.325 --> 01:03:22.895
obedience and fidelity to Christ.

1176
01:03:22.915 --> 01:03:25.055
So it is a condition of church membership.

1177
01:03:25.715 --> 01:03:29.015
Uh, but we haven't seen in scripture that it's a condition

1178
01:03:29.155 --> 01:03:31.055
for taking the Lord's Supper.

1179
01:03:31.155 --> 01:03:32.535
So we don't say that anymore.

1180
01:03:33.195 --> 01:03:35.505
We say, if you're a believer in Christ, you're welcome

1181
01:03:35.525 --> 01:03:36.625
to the Lord's table.

1182
01:03:37.565 --> 01:03:40.585
So that, that's where we are currently. And Aaron,

1183
01:03:40.845 --> 01:03:42.905
And agree with of Those, both of I misstated there.

1184
01:03:44.385 --> 01:03:45.465
I agree with both of those.

1185
01:03:45.565 --> 01:03:47.905
And I think what Ryan was trying to say is, ideally

1186
01:03:49.285 --> 01:03:51.545
we would, we would like for you to be baptized first

1187
01:03:51.645 --> 01:03:52.745
and then do the Lord's Supper.

1188
01:03:52.745 --> 01:03:56.065
But here's the thing, in the New Testament,

1189
01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:59.585
they would've gotten baptized immediately after salvation.

1190
01:04:00.365 --> 01:04:01.745
So this was never a question.

1191
01:04:02.215 --> 01:04:05.025
Everybody who took the Lord's Supper would've been baptized.

1192
01:04:05.865 --> 01:04:07.425
'cause you see, immediately they get saved,

1193
01:04:07.655 --> 01:04:09.185
immediately they get baptized.

1194
01:04:10.205 --> 01:04:13.585
So, but the problem we have today is somebody gets saved

1195
01:04:14.485 --> 01:04:17.825
and they schedule their baptism for two months from today,

1196
01:04:18.945 --> 01:04:20.525
and we have the Lord's Supper twice

1197
01:04:20.665 --> 01:04:24.045
before they get baptized, can they take the Lord's supper?

1198
01:04:24.505 --> 01:04:26.645
And we've been asked that before, particularly with kids.

1199
01:04:27.355 --> 01:04:30.125
Kids get saved. We want the whole family

1200
01:04:30.145 --> 01:04:31.405
to be here for their baptism.

1201
01:04:32.155 --> 01:04:33.525
It's two months down the road.

1202
01:04:33.585 --> 01:04:36.485
But we've had the Lord's Supper twice, so we get asked,

1203
01:04:36.625 --> 01:04:38.405
can my son have the Lord's Supper?

1204
01:04:39.515 --> 01:04:44.125
Well, the answer to that is, that's up to you mom and dad.

1205
01:04:45.265 --> 01:04:47.525
But we like to tell them, we would prefer

1206
01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:50.605
that you would be baptized first out of obedience.

1207
01:04:50.605 --> 01:04:52.045
And then, but we can't.

1208
01:04:52.045 --> 01:04:55.925
There's, as Joe said, there's no verse that we can point to

1209
01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.405
that says, no, you cannot.

1210
01:04:58.385 --> 01:05:01.125
Um, if they're saved, they can have the Lord's Supper.

1211
01:05:01.695 --> 01:05:03.325
We've got their baptism scheduled.

1212
01:05:03.345 --> 01:05:06.485
You know, in our modern structure,

1213
01:05:06.615 --> 01:05:07.925
we've kind of created this problem.

1214
01:05:08.025 --> 01:05:10.365
But I don't think that was a problem in the New Testament.

1215
01:05:10.985 --> 01:05:13.005
So thank you, Lord. Hopefully that makes sense.

1216
01:05:14.345 --> 01:05:15.765
So if we're airing, it may be

1217
01:05:15.765 --> 01:05:17.590
that we don't baptize people immediately,

1218
01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:19.445
but then that's another discussion to have

1219
01:05:21.515 --> 01:05:23.645
Some churches, as soon as you get saved, they'll,

1220
01:05:23.645 --> 01:05:26.005
they'll dunk you on the stage, right?

1221
01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:28.165
Because they don't want, they don't want

1222
01:05:28.165 --> 01:05:29.165
that confusion there.

1223
01:05:29.545 --> 01:05:31.365
So we've never done that here.

1224
01:05:33.675 --> 01:05:36.805
Good question. Good question, Sherry.

1225
01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:40.205
Hey, my question, um, might be just terminology,

1226
01:05:40.385 --> 01:05:43.925
but, um, as far as ordinances, I've always heard

1227
01:05:44.525 --> 01:05:46.525
marriage referred to as an ordinance.

1228
01:05:48.035 --> 01:05:50.305
Is that true?

1229
01:05:50.525 --> 01:05:53.585
Or how do we phrase that at, at Henderson?

1230
01:05:55.245 --> 01:05:57.215
I've never heard that. So that's new to me.

1231
01:05:57.695 --> 01:05:59.175
Question. Marriage as an ordinance

1232
01:05:59.675 --> 01:06:01.495
Is marriage as an ordinance of the church.

1233
01:06:01.845 --> 01:06:02.845
Okay.

1234
01:06:03.445 --> 01:06:05.095
Yeah. I, I haven't heard that either.

1235
01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:08.495
I know that, um, the Catholic church has a whole list

1236
01:06:08.515 --> 01:06:09.655
of sacraments.

1237
01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:13.295
I'm not sure if that's on their list of sacraments. It is.

1238
01:06:13.445 --> 01:06:15.735
Okay. So maybe that's where that comes from.

1239
01:06:16.595 --> 01:06:19.055
Um, and then if you're curious, the language

1240
01:06:19.055 --> 01:06:22.935
of sacrament versus ordinance, um,

1241
01:06:23.475 --> 01:06:25.215
for all intents and purposes, you can kind

1242
01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:26.495
of consider them the same thing.

1243
01:06:27.355 --> 01:06:30.015
Uh, but there, there was a distancing of, uh,

1244
01:06:30.325 --> 01:06:33.975
away from the word sacrament, Ackerman, around the time

1245
01:06:33.975 --> 01:06:36.095
of the reformation, uh, just

1246
01:06:36.095 --> 01:06:37.295
because of its connection to the,

1247
01:06:37.515 --> 01:06:39.095
to the Catholic church. And so

1248
01:06:39.445 --> 01:06:41.175
It's all Martin Luther's fault. Yeah.

1249
01:06:41.475 --> 01:06:45.335
Martin, yeah. Thank you.

1250
01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:49.395
Sherry. Any other questions?

1251
01:06:50.275 --> 01:06:51.955
Probably should, probably, it's almost time.

1252
01:06:52.185 --> 01:06:53.715
Okay. We got four more minutes.

1253
01:06:55.285 --> 01:06:58.085
Alright. Thank you all.

1254
01:06:58.435 --> 01:07:00.405
Yeah, thank you all very much.

1255
01:07:00.405 --> 01:07:03.205
Well, let's go ahead and pray and we'll get on outta here.

1256
01:07:03.985 --> 01:07:06.925
Father, we thank you for tonight.

1257
01:07:06.925 --> 01:07:08.125
Thank you for my brothers up here.

1258
01:07:09.145 --> 01:07:10.605
Joe and Aaron, thank you

1259
01:07:10.605 --> 01:07:12.805
for the church body that's before us.

1260
01:07:13.375 --> 01:07:15.485
Thank you for this fellowship that we share together.

1261
01:07:15.535 --> 01:07:18.365
We're so blessed and honored to be able

1262
01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:20.245
to serve alongside everybody here.

1263
01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:24.965
Um, Jesus, you love your church.

1264
01:07:26.225 --> 01:07:30.645
Um, there is no other institution that you call your body

1265
01:07:31.705 --> 01:07:33.005
and we don't take that lightly.

1266
01:07:33.225 --> 01:07:37.325
Um, so God help us to serve in the unique giftings

1267
01:07:37.325 --> 01:07:39.165
that you've given to each of us.

1268
01:07:40.385 --> 01:07:42.485
Um, there is no part of the body

1269
01:07:42.485 --> 01:07:44.845
that is less valuable than any other part.

1270
01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:47.765
And so, God, we pray that you would use us,

1271
01:07:48.025 --> 01:07:52.045
use everybody individually in this church to serve the body.

1272
01:07:52.825 --> 01:07:56.485
We need them. But God, let us also revel in your grace

1273
01:07:56.555 --> 01:07:58.805
that you've shown to us, your great mercy

1274
01:07:59.105 --> 01:08:01.165
and your grace that you've shown to us.

1275
01:08:01.715 --> 01:08:03.885
That it is by grace that we have been saved.

1276
01:08:06.185 --> 01:08:09.165
So we are so thankful for Jesus, for his sacrifice

1277
01:08:09.265 --> 01:08:12.325
for us on the cross, that he would, um,

1278
01:08:12.515 --> 01:08:14.445
that he would die on the cross for our sins,

1279
01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:15.885
for, for even us.

1280
01:08:18.025 --> 01:08:19.805
So God, we pray that you would preserve your church,

1281
01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:21.965
that you would use us in your church

1282
01:08:22.065 --> 01:08:26.005
to accomplish your mission in, in the world, so

1283
01:08:26.005 --> 01:08:27.525
that others would come to know you.

1284
01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:31.045
Jesus, we love you. We trust you.

1285
01:08:31.045 --> 01:08:34.725
It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Thank you all.
