00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.150
Hi, I'm Phil Sly.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.150
I'm the pastor of Discipleship and Community here at Henderson Hills,

3
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.830
and we're looking at an opportunity for community group certification training.

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.870
We're looking at community group through a philosophical, practical,

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.070
and passionate approach.

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.870
And right now we're gonna be looking at the role of the community group Prayer

7
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.070
and care coordinator.

8
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.550
Ministering to one another is one of the highest purpose and probably one of the

9
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.470
most fulfilling purposes of the community group.

10
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.830
And the group will grow in relational intimacy as they share mutually and

11
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.870
have ex an exchange life experiences and grow with one another in the Lord.

12
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.243
And so,

13
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.830
a loving and caring community group is a unique Christian experience

14
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.963
and way of life.

15
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.710
No other group shares all that a community group shares as it pertains to loving

16
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.670
and caring and praying for one another.

17
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.190
And so it's possible only through God's grace and through the work of Jesus

18
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.630
Christ.

19
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.590
And so we see Christianity being built on the foundation of love and compassion

20
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.430
and service with Christ as our ultimate example.

21
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.790
And so we as believers are called to be ministers and to care for one another.

22
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.990
And when we do that,

23
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.110
we foster Christian community that reflects the teachings of Jesus.

24
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.030
And so we're gonna explore three key issues as it pertains to the prayer and

25
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.863
care coordinator.

26
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.790
We're gonna look at biblical principles that demonstrate the value of prayer and

27
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.670
caring. We're also gonna look practical ways of how to pray for one another and

28
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.750
practical ways of how to care for one another.

29
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.270
So let's first look at these bi biblical principles. Um,

30
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.430
we'll see number one, that love is the foundation of caring.

31
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.510
And we know in John 1334 and 35 that Jesus said,

32
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.590
A new commandment I give to you love one another as I have loved you.

33
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.470
You are also to love one another. And by this,

34
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.350
will all men know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another.

35
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.710
So love lies at the heart of Christian ministry.

36
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.670
And caring for one another flows from this deep wellspring of God's love

37
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.510
for us through Jesus. And so when we minister to one another,

38
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.910
we embody the love of Christ and created a community where genuine

39
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.710
compassion and understanding and support, uh, they just thrive.

40
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.410
And,

41
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.350
and it comes out of this natural outpouring of God's love as we intercede for

42
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.130
one another in prayer,

43
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.830
and as we seek God God's guidance for one another in prayer.

44
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.190
And when we experience God's blessings and God's healings and God's lessons

45
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.470
through prayer. Number two, we wanna look at equipping through prayer.

46
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.550
The Apostle Paul said to the Ephesians,

47
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.310
and he emphasizes different God-given roles,

48
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.510
and he said he gave some to be apostles and some to be prophets and evangelists

49
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.390
and shepherds and teachers for this purpose to equip the saints for the work

50
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.030
of ministry in building up the body of Christ.

51
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.070
And listen to this until we all attain the unity of the faith and the knowledge

52
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.710
of the Son of God to mature manhood to the measure and stature of the fullness

53
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.250
of Christ.

54
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.240
So prayer plays a pivotal role in equipping and nurturing

55
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.720
believers for ministry.

56
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.320
It's through prayer that leaders will seek divine guidance and wisdom and

57
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.640
discernment to serve the community group effectively.

58
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.720
And so we see how intercessory prayer empowers individuals in the community

59
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.320
group find their unique calling in the service of God.

60
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.280
It also fosters unity and maturity within the Christian community.

61
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.880
The community group grows together in their faith. Uh, lastly,

62
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.880
a believer in Jesus is equipped for works of service when that person is

63
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.600
cared for or cares for others within the community group.

64
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.400
When the body of Christ is properly cared for,

65
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.440
the result is unity and maturity and knowledge in the son of God.

66
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.360
Number three, scriptural proof is that prayerful, uh,

67
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.840
talks about prayerful acts of genuine love. Paul, in his letter to the Romans,

68
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.880
uh, offers this practical aspect of Christian care. He says,

69
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.520
let love be genuine. Ab bore what is evil. Hold fast to what is good,

70
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.600
love one another with brotherly affection and outdo one another in showing

71
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.640
honor. Do not be slothful and zeal, but be fervent in spirit and serve the Lord.

72
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.680
Listen to this, rejoice and hope.

73
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.200
Be patient in tribulation and be constant in prayer.

74
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.120
Contribute to the needs of the saint, and seek to show hospitality.

75
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.360
So prayer is inseparable from genuine love. It,

76
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.840
it actually characterizes real genuine Christian care.

77
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.440
When we pray for one another, we lift up one another's burdens before God,

78
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.840
and we share in one another's sorrows and joys.

79
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.840
So prayer cultivates empathy. It fosters a deep sense of connection,

80
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.280
and it is through these prayerful acts of service that we demonstrate Christ's

81
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.120
love. Number three, we look at shepherding through prayer.

82
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.160
In the early Christian Church,

83
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.640
Peter addresses the role of the leader within that community and encouraged them

84
00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.520
to be humble. Shepherds, he says, shepherd the flock of God that is among you,

85
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.600
exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly as God would have you,

86
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.120
not for shameful gain, but eagerly not domineering over those in your charge,

87
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.360
but being an examples to the flock. And when the chief shepherd appears,

88
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.080
that's capital ss Jesus himself, when he appears,

89
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.680
you'll receive an unfading crown of glory.

90
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.880
So prayer is a vital tool for Christian leaders to watch over and to care

91
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.960
for their community group. And through prayer,

92
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.520
they seek divide to shepherd the flock that God has entrusted to him,

93
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.600
to them with wisdom and humility and compassion.

94
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.440
They intercede for the needs of their community group,

95
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.920
and they foster a culture of spiritual growth and healing and unity and,

96
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.760
and thankfulness. Uh,

97
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.200
Christian ministry is a divine call to love and serve and care for one another,

98
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.040
just like Christ did for us.

99
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.680
And so we're inspired by Jesus' teachings and by the guidance of the biblical

100
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.160
passages.

101
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.080
And we understand the indispensable role of prayer in our ministry and in our

102
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.360
leadership. See,

103
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.040
I believe that prayer is the lifeline that connects us to God's grace and power

104
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.560
and enables us then to intercede and to seek guidance and to serve one another

105
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.960
with genuine love and real compassion.

106
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.440
So through these prayerful acts of service,

107
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.720
a Christian community group becomes a beacon of hope and a demonstration of

108
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.040
just transformative power in Christ's love in the world.

109
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.640
So let's look now at these last two things,

110
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.400
practical ways for a community group to pray for one another and practical ways

111
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.560
for community group to care for one another. Let's first talk about prayer.

112
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.480
So a community group understands the necessity to refuse this prayer time,

113
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.480
to refuse to gossip or to cast blame or to shame one another,

114
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.320
to be judgmental or criticize people. Rather,

115
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.440
they are being genuine and transparent and vulnerable when they're making

116
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.280
prayer requests. And so they're to be treated with a degree of sensitivity.

117
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.200
And having discretion and permission to share prayer requests is essential.

118
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.000
I wouldn't just post everything you hear without permission.

119
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.200
So you get permission to share prayer requests to the entire community group,

120
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.880
and you're discreet about those.

121
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.040
Sometimes you have to rewrite them so that their sensitive information is sent

122
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.760
out publicly. And if you have questions, if it's too sensitive to send,

123
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.280
then rephrase it or just choose not to send it. Just, uh, make it a, uh,

124
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.080
an anonymous prayer request, if you will. Uh,

125
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.920
so you collect these prayer requests from the community room at a time that's

126
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.120
agreeable to the director and the teacher. Uh, one of the problems that's, uh,

127
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.880
been just a,

128
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.600
a a significant problem for a lot of community groups is the prayer time goes

129
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.800
long. And as a result, then there's very,

130
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.280
very little time for studying the scriptures together.

131
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.680
And that's frustrating for the teacher because he or she has prepared that time

132
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.520
and now has only got 10, 15 minutes to, uh, to present that. And so it,

133
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.640
it's always a problem.

134
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.200
And so here are a few ideas for collecting and distributing prayer requests. Uh,

135
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.360
my community group,

136
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.880
we pass around three by five cards at the beginning of the group.

137
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.440
And then before the end of the group,

138
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.120
we ask our prayer and care coordinator to collect those cards.

139
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.520
And then they're responsible for distributing those prayer requests. And so, uh,

140
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.800
another thing you can do is on the whiteboard just to ask community group

141
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.840
members to write their prayer requests down, uh, on the board. And, uh,

142
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.430
in doing so,

143
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.720
then maybe later you'll have an opportunity to break into small groups to pray

144
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.600
for the requests that have been listed on the whiteboard. Another idea,

145
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.800
especially for our younger groups, is to use technology to gather requests.

146
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.080
My group uses GroupMe.

147
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.720
We collect them by three by five card within the prayer and care coordinator

148
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.880
will post them on GroupMe, which everyone receives on their smart device.

149
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.480
And everyone gets notification that they've been called to pray. Uh,

150
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.720
I've seen other community groups who will use a Q card, uh,

151
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.040
a QR code that will take them to a, a Google form, which, um,

152
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:03.160
then will go to everyone who's agreed that sometimes, uh, the people will use a,

153
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.800
uh, uh, email groups to send out, uh,

154
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.680
prayer requests and, and, uh,

155
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.600
or maybe even a prayer blog or a private Facebook page to distribute these

156
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.800
prayer requests. Uh,

157
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.160
one thing I'm going to ask those of you who use emails to do is this, uh,

158
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.320
for security and for privacy reasons,

159
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.720
it's best practices to paste the email addresses in the blind carbon

160
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.920
copy section. And, uh,

161
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.280
especially when you're sending it out to a very large community group.

162
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.840
And when you do that,

163
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.080
then those addresses are not visible to the recipients of the email. Uh,

164
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.280
I don't know if this has happened to you, but it has happened to several, uh,

165
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.120
people that I know, that people has used those lists to actually farm business,

166
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.160
uh, uh, their business. And it's, it's not what, not what it's intended for. So,

167
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.720
um, give everyone a blank note card as they enter the room,

168
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.000
ask 'em to write down their prayer request and then redistribute those cards,

169
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.640
um, so that people will have someone to pray for for them every week. Uh,

170
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:08.080
one last thing that I want us to talk about is, uh, family rules. Now,

171
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.080
family rules are a very, uh,

172
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.880
helpful way of providing some time boundaries for prayer requests.

173
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.240
And so what you can do for family rules is ask your community group to only

174
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.240
present prayer requests for people that live in their home or have lived in

175
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.680
their, their home, or have once lived in their home. Uh,

176
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.680
community group prayer requests can go really, really long.

177
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.600
Whenever we start praying for neighbors, uh,

178
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.160
family who live somewhere that no one has really heard of before,

179
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.120
those doesn't mean we shouldn't pray for those things,

180
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.120
it's just that they're not as important as family rule prayer time.

181
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.680
So let's also look at the way a community group can care for one another. Uh,

182
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.440
we're going to ask you as a prayer and care coordinator to utilize the community

183
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.800
group leadership team to create a culture,

184
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.200
a culture of celebration and love whenever there's, uh,

185
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.720
something to be celebrated, uh,

186
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.680
community group members know that they're cared for.

187
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.760
If the community group celebrates with them and stands with them in the time of

188
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.840
trouble and crisis, let's first look at celebration and love.

189
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.960
A healthy Christian community is characterized by a sense of belonging. And so,

190
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:20.520
uh,

191
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.480
community group members share a measure of empathy during times of both trouble

192
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.360
and crisis, but also celebration and love.

193
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.880
And we're gonna talk about celebration and love. Uh, Romans 12,

194
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.120
15 through 18 says,

195
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.040
rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep.

196
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.720
Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty,

197
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.960
but associate with the lowly and never be wise in your own sight,

198
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.760
but repay no one evil for evil.

199
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:50.280
But give thought to those who do what is honorable in the sight of all if

200
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.680
possible, as far as it depends on you live peaceably with all.

201
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.360
So what does it mean to love our community group members? Well, number one,

202
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.880
I think you need to know them. Know their names,

203
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.960
know their spouses and family members know their careers and their hobbies,

204
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:09.280
their likes and their dislikes. Know when they're absent from the group. Uh,

205
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.120
I think it's very noble of a community group to decide that we're going to be a

206
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.840
group that chases the strays. If someone doesn't show, uh,

207
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.480
maybe if you don't know where they are, um, give them a text and ask them. Say,

208
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.000
Hey, we missed you. Is everything okay? Um,

209
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:27.280
what you're trying to do is providing for the spiritual needs of those in your

210
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.760
group by, um, having a,

211
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.000
a belonging sense of group interaction where we affirm one another,

212
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.160
where there's mutual rejoicing and,

213
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.960
and sincere em empathetic responses and kind of a reciprocal

214
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.760
honor among group members. And so we,

215
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.320
another thing we can do is we can seek practical ways to serve one another. Uh,

216
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.120
Jesus said in Matthew 2026 through 28 said, uh,

217
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.640
it shall not be like that among you,

218
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.520
but whoever would be great among you must be your servant.

219
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.640
And whoever must be first among you must become your slave.

220
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.320
Even as the son of man talking about himself, Jesus said, he,

221
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.520
I didn't come to be served,

222
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.440
but to serve and to give my life as a ransom for many. So, uh,

223
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.280
Jesus is showing us that we build relationships in our groups

224
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.440
by showing one another how we love one another.

225
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.320
And that oftentimes must happen apart from the group meeting. Uh,

226
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:26.000
share lunch with one another after church, send cards or texts or emails,

227
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:31.120
uh, pay close attention to group members that are not there that miss

228
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.760
meetings. Uh,

229
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.680
and then another thing you can do is share resources for those who are in need.

230
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.400
Uh, people who are, um,

231
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.560
have family members who are in the hospital or who may be out of work,

232
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.920
I would say, uh, provide meals for them. There's so many ways to do this now.

233
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.880
I used to, you'd have to take food by,

234
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.560
but now there's Uber Eats and GrubHub and gift cards and those kinds of things.

235
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.720
And, and so, uh, uh, I,

236
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.720
I've made it a habit for sometimes when people are really struggling,

237
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.320
it's just to pick up a pizza on the way home and deliver it,

238
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.720
or bringing groceries or even some sort of a dessert or flowers or treats or

239
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.480
whatever, uh, offer to provide transportation. Uh, uh,

240
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.680
my next door neighbor one time, uh, was in a, in a bad way,

241
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.800
and I just decided that I, whenever I mowed my lawn, I'd mow his lawn.

242
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.160
It wasn't a very large lawn, but it's just an opportunity to show Christ's love.

243
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.390
And, uh,

244
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:27.120
another thing you could do is watch the kids or maybe visit an an elderly, uh,

245
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.840
parent. Uh, acts 2 45, uh, 45 says,

246
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.120
and they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the

247
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.920
proceeds to all as any had need. And day after day,

248
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.760
attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes,

249
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.760
they receive their food with glad and generous hearts,

250
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.640
praising God and having favor with all the people.

251
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.760
And look what happens as a result of them sharing mutual love and honor,

252
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.280
and the Lord added to their number daily, those who are being saved.

253
00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.560
So, uh, we as community group leaders,

254
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.320
and you specifically as a prayer and share, uh, prayer and care coordinator,

255
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.040
uh, need to,

256
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.080
to make an effort to share in the celebration of notable stages of

257
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.880
life, change significant milestones,

258
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:19.360
events like birthdays and anniversaries, maybe the birth of a child, baptism,

259
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.120
the marriage, empty nesting retirement,

260
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.040
any significant life change couldn't be celebrated by your community group.

261
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.680
And in doing so, you're shepherding and caring for members,

262
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.920
and they know that and they feel loved. Now, the second way that you, uh,

263
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.280
show someone love and care is during trouble.

264
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.200
And crisis community groups minister to one another during emergencies,

265
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.920
during crises by shepherding and caring for one another. And, uh,

266
00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:51.280
sometimes shepherding and caring are words that are used synonymously in

267
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.200
Christian language, but by definition it means to tend to,

268
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.720
or to guard and to lead much like a shepherd does in caring for a sheep.

269
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.760
So a shepherding a church member is providing loving care and, uh,

270
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.600
nurture and spiritual guidance, emotional support,

271
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.600
even financial assistance and physical aid when there's a need.

272
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.800
The most effective way of providing biblical shepherding and caring is through

273
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.840
intentional decentralization. Now,

274
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.680
I know decentralization is not a biblical word,

275
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.440
but it describes exactly what we're trying to do in a large church.

276
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.880
Decentralization is the deliberate decision to disperse or distribute the

277
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.880
role of shepherding and caring among the church. Um,

278
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.400
if we relied upon our lead teaching pastor to do all the shepherding and

279
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.920
caring, most of us would feel like we hadn't had enough care and share.

280
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.320
So what he's done now is decentralize the effort of

281
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.120
shepherding to community group leaders.

282
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.160
And what I'm asking you to do as the community group prayer and care coordinator

283
00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:01.320
is to take that role of decentralizing the care and shepherding

284
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.040
and and distributed among your group. And in doing so,

285
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.040
we know that everyone will be taken care of,

286
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.320
but there will be opportunities whenever there's an issue that arises in your

287
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.240
group that might go outside of the scope of your community group to tend to

288
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.480
alone. And so at that point,

289
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.080
we're gonna ask that you share that burden of the responsibility and shepherding

290
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.520
and caring with the elders and the deacons and the paid ministerial staff. Uh,

291
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:31.040
we have committed as a leadership group in the staff to be, uh,

292
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.360
to come alongside our members in mobilizing and equipping and empowering and

293
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.480
supporting a community group leadership to care for people in time of need,

294
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.120
but also come alongside them when that burden is too great. Um,

295
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.920
in a large and growing church like Henderson Hills,

296
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.320
the elders and the deacons and the ministerial staff and the community group

297
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.240
leaders must partner together to shepherd God's flock.

298
00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.040
And as the church grows even larger, the more necessary, uh,

299
00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.600
the more useful, the more effective the leadership,

300
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.240
the community group's going to be in becoming quality shepherds who care for and

301
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.760
love the flock. Um,

302
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:12.440
also when we talk about caring for members facing trouble in crisis, um,

303
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.080
we need to understand that, uh, that,

304
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.960
that there are a number of times when people fully expect to be contacted by

305
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.720
those who love them. A physical illness, a career crisis or job loss,

306
00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.880
uh, marriage or family strife. Uh, the death of a loved one. Uh,

307
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.840
I was so proud of our staff yesterday because one of our, uh,

308
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.720
part-time staff's mother passed away unexpectedly. In fact,

309
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.840
we had prayed for her just, uh, the Tuesday prior to her passing on Thursday.

310
00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.200
And, uh, just yesterday, almost the entire staff came to the funeral.

311
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.160
And we had not had an opportunity to meet her mother, but that didn't matter.

312
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.000
We know her and we love this staff person.

313
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.320
So we came alongside her as her community. Um,

314
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.440
community group members who share in the suffering, uh,

315
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.360
often do so during times of unexpected crisis,

316
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.200
like emergency room visits or hospitalizations or surgeries or,

317
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:11.200
uh, serious medical procedures. And, um, they understand that,

318
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:16.320
that there's almost a triage process where leadership has to determine urgency

319
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.880
and attention. And so, uh,

320
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.440
at what level do we need to provide shepherding and care?

321
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.880
Do I need to get up out of bed and get to the hospital,

322
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.600
or is this something that can wait till the morning? So, um,

323
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.280
here are the groups that come together for decentralization,

324
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.680
for sharing the opportunity and the privilege of shepherding and caring for one

325
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.360
another. There's community groups and first and foremost,

326
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.400
but there's also ministry groups. I know that our, uh,

327
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.240
not only our discipleship and community,

328
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.800
but our kids' ministry and our youth ministry and our worship ministry,

329
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.800
they're all very involved in caring for one another,

330
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.840
but also discipleship groups.

331
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.920
We have a women's mentoring and men's radical mentoring,

332
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.680
and we have micro groups. And this also includes our, uh,

333
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.720
our elders and our deacons and our ministerial staff. Uh,

334
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.720
I know our Celebrate Recovery groups do a great job in supporting one another

335
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:11.200
and also ministries of Jesus comes alongside and provides all kinds of care that

336
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.120
people might not have, uh, if they did not have the kind of, uh,

337
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.600
resources that some have. So, uh, let's talk about this in conclusion.

338
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:24.880
Your role as a community group prayer and care coordinator is crucial

339
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.360
for the life of your community group and for the hurting in your community

340
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.240
group. And as you shepherd and care for these people,

341
00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:37.400
you're encouraged to minister to them towards the love of Christ and for the

342
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.400
gospel. And if you do so, you are embodying Christ's love for the church,

343
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.800
and you're becoming the disciple by this Will Allman know that you're my

344
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.560
disciples because you have love for one another.
