1
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.800
If then you have been raised with Christ,

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.560
seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

3
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.840
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth

4
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.680
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

5
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.240
When Christ who is your life appears, then you will also appear with him. And

6
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.200
Well, good morning, faith, family. Uh, if you are new, welcome.

7
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.040
We're glad you're here. My name is John. I'm one of the pastors here.

8
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.560
I would love to meet you if I haven't had a chance to yet.

9
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.160
I try to work around the room before, but uh, if I haven't yet,

10
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.880
please come say hello afterwards. I'd love to meet you. Uh,

11
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.800
today we're continuing in our series through the book of Colossians.

12
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.760
And so as we've been walking for a few weeks, I wanna catch you up just briefly.

13
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.240
Remember the Apostle Paul wrote this letter to the young church in Colossae,

14
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.640
a church that was living in the ccs of what we might call religious pluralism.

15
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.200
Uh,

16
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.160
which basically means there's a lot of different mish mashes of belief systems

17
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.000
and religious practices. And so they were pressured by all of these things.

18
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.240
And so Paul here reminded the Colossians of the truths that they had heard and

19
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.200
believed in the gospel of Jesus Christ,

20
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.320
that the God they worshiped was the one true God.

21
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.640
So hang on, is basically what he was saying to them. Stay steadfast.

22
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.960
Well,

23
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.840
today we're gonna get a glimpse into how Paul portrayed his ministry to them.

24
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.360
How did he see his ministry in Colossae? But then also not only that,

25
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.520
how does that inform our ministry even today as we learn

26
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.920
from him? And so take your copy of God's word,

27
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.320
turn with me to the letter to the Colossians.

28
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.400
The end of chapter one is where we're going to be into chapter two.

29
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.760
You might keep your bookmark there that you got in the lobby. Colossians one,

30
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.400
starting in verse 24 is where we're gonna be down through chapter two,

31
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.680
verse five. I'm gonna read it to start with.

32
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.160
Paul writes to the Colossians continuing this letter. He says,

33
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.080
now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake and

34
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.913
in my flesh,

35
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.240
I'm filling up what is lacking in Christ afflictions for the sake of his body.

36
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.200
That is the church of which I became a minister according to the stewardship

37
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.920
from God that was given to me. For you to make the word of God fully known,

38
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.920
the mystery hidden for ages and generations,

39
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.280
but now revealed to his saints. To them God chose to make known.

40
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.840
How great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery,

41
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.760
which is Christ in you,

42
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.520
the hope of glory Him we proclaim warning

43
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.640
everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom that we may present,

44
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.440
everyone mature in Christ.

45
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.600
For this I toil struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within

46
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.560
me for I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and

47
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.600
for those at Leo Deia, which was a a city nearby.

48
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.080
And for all those who have not seen me face to face,

49
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.400
that their hearts may be encouraged being knit together in love,

50
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.040
to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of

51
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.760
God's mystery, which is Christ in whom all hidden,

52
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.880
all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

53
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.320
And I say this in order that no one would delude you with plausible arguments

54
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.960
for though I'm absent in body,

55
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.280
yet I'm with you in spirit rejoicing to see your good order and the

56
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.200
firmness of your faith in Christ. God,

57
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.280
help us to see what you want us to see today.

58
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.160
I pray you take the blinders off of our eyes and our hearts.

59
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.360
We would understand more of who you are,

60
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.240
more of what we can do in response to that. But God, you have to do that work.

61
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.200
You have to change us.

62
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.960
Make us good soil that you plant this word in that it would bear good

63
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.760
fruit. Give us eyes to see, ears to hear for your glory in Jesus' name.

64
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.343
Amen.

65
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.800
And so the first thing we need to understand here is the nature of Paul's

66
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.760
ministry. We start with this, right? What was Paul's ministry like?

67
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.080
As we understand and and study his ministry,

68
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.800
it'll help inform our ministries even today. So as we look at Paul's ministry,

69
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.560
what he describes,

70
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.240
the first aspect we need to understand is that God called Paul to this ministry.

71
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.960
God called Paul to this.

72
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.480
Paul didn't just wake up one day and decide to do it on his own. God called him.

73
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.160
He wrote here in verse 25, he became a minister of Christ's body,

74
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.680
the church. He says according to the stewardship from God given to him.

75
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.140
So,

76
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.040
so think about like the manager of an estate would steward the resources of the

77
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.600
owner. It's similar here.

78
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.400
Paul had been given this call of God to minister to,

79
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.080
or another word could be serve.

80
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.560
The actual word is the word we used deacon today,

81
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.240
same word all in the original language.

82
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.480
He was given this call to serve minister to the church as he proclaimed the word

83
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.110
of God. Now, how do we know Paul was called?

84
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.600
Well, this goes all the way back to his Saul to Paul conversion story

85
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.000
back in Acts chapter nine, where he went to Damascus to persecute Christians.

86
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.960
Well, Jesus meets him on the road, blinds him,

87
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.200
and then he takes him to Damascus and and sends Barnabas,

88
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.880
who we've seen all throughout the New Testament now.

89
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.440
But Barnabas goes to Paul to preach the gospel.

90
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.440
And through that God actually calls Paul to the ministry.

91
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.080
And I wanna read what Jesus said there in Acts nine in this

92
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.440
calling to Paul Acts chapter nine, verse 15 and 16.

93
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.120
The Lord said to Barnabas to tell to Paul, he says,

94
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.000
go for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before

95
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.000
the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel,

96
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.800
for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.

97
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.440
So we learned some things about Paul's ministry, even from the call,

98
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.360
Paul was called to be an apostle to the Gentiles,

99
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.200
to the non-Jewish people. Paul was called to be that representative,

100
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.280
that authority representative. He'd been a leader among the Jews.

101
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.040
He'd grown up a Jew, but, but God used him to go to the nations,

102
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.480
to those who don't have the promises of God like Israel has had from the Old

103
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.160
Testament. All the story, the Gentiles didn't have it. So God said, Paul,

104
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.120
you're going to them. And as you go,

105
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.280
you're going to make the word of God fully known. He's what Colossians one said.

106
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.480
So that even the Gentiles would be able to see the riches

107
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.640
of this glory,

108
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.160
of this mystery now revealed the thing that had been hidden for so long.

109
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.840
Like who is this messiah who's coming? Here he is.

110
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.520
It's now revealed. But even the Gentiles should hear about this.

111
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.320
That's what Ephesians chapter three,

112
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.280
verse six shows us very clearly where he says,

113
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.240
the mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs,

114
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.800
members of the same body and partakers of the promise in Christ

115
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.800
Jesus through the gospel. Right? That's the mystery here.

116
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.560
The Jews thought maybe it's just for us. The mystery is that no, in the Messiah,

117
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.600
it's going to actually be for Gentiles and Jews together into one body.

118
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.680
That's good news for us even today, who are mostly non-Jewish background, right?

119
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.520
It's the same mystery that Colossians 1 27 talks about,

120
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.120
that Christ can even be in the Gentiles as their hope

121
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.240
just as much as the Israelites could have.

122
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.080
And that was Paul's calling was to take that message of unity,

123
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.480
Gentiles and Jews, one body to the nations.

124
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.320
But do you remember God also called Paul to this? This is Acts chapter nine, uh,

125
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.680
verse 16. Again, remember what Jesus said?

126
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.120
I will show him, Paul,

127
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.080
how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.

128
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.000
Now, I'm sure Paul hears that and he's like, great, this is gonna be awesome,

129
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.960
right? That's, that's a hard thing to hear when you're called to the ministry,

130
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.040
is that you're just gonna suffer.

131
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.160
Yet because of what he had received from the Lord in his

132
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.240
salvation, Paul willingly did it.

133
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:29.670
He

134
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.400
Knew how far from God he was and yet Christ saved him. And so he's like,

135
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.293
I'm in,

136
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.840
In fact willing to endure what Paul himself

137
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.920
recounts. This is two Corinthians 11.

138
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.400
This is his story of recounting what he has experienced in ministry. He says,

139
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.080
far greater labors, far more imprisonments, countless beatings,

140
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:58.400
often near death. Five times I received at the hands of the Jews,

141
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.520
the 40 lashes, lest one, they thought 40 killed you. So they gave him 39.

142
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.120
Three times I was beaten with rods once I was stoned with stones.

143
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.120
Three times I was shipwrecked a night and a day adrift at sea on

144
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.680
frequent journeys in danger from rivers, from robbers, from my own people,

145
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.760
from gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness at sea,

146
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:24.800
from false brothers in toil and hardship through many a sleepless night

147
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.360
in hunger and thirst,

148
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:31.240
often without food in cold and exposure and apart from other things,

149
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.600
there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches.

150
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.160
I haven't gone through anything like that in ministry. Have you?

151
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.410
He's probably even writing this letter from prison.

152
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.930
And so think about that. In all of this that he's experienced,

153
00:10:55.030 --> 00:11:00.010
if Paul did not have a secure call on his life

154
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.730
from the Lord, he would've bailed quickly, right?

155
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.650
But he didn't. He didn't.

156
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.530
He stayed steadfast.

157
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.610
He kept running this race that God had marked out for him.

158
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.983
Why?

159
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.250
Because he was publicly identifying with the sufferings of

160
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.090
Christ on his behalf. See,

161
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.450
that's what he said in Colossians 1 24.

162
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.730
That's what he meant when he was filling up the what is lacking in Christ's

163
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.050
afflictions for the sake of the church. Now, that's widely misunderstood.

164
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.810
It's not saying that Christ's death was somehow not enough and Paul had to do

165
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.130
more to save. That's not at all what it's about.

166
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.610
He's saying that suffering is part of the deal.

167
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.320
It's part of the deal. And in some ways,

168
00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:01.640
when you think about Christ being the head of his body, if we are Christ's body,

169
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.800
we're gonna suffer like he did. Why do we think we're immune?

170
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.880
And in some way also, Paul is trying to like a,

171
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.880
as a leader should, but,

172
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.320
but as Paul looked at Christ doing this for him,

173
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.120
he looked at the church in Colossae and he's trying to take some of the

174
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.880
suffering off of them to take some of the arrows that they might take.

175
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.840
He's like, no, I wanna take them. I wanna take them.

176
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.440
I wanna take the affliction. So they don't have as much.

177
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:31.480
That's

178
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.313
What good leaders do.

179
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.680
And so God called Paul to this ministry,

180
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.320
to the Gentiles and to the Jews too,

181
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.200
but mostly to the Gentiles to suffer for his name.

182
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.170
It's what God called Paul too. But if all of that was what he was going to face,

183
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.530
it seems impossible.

184
00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.170
That's why it was only possible if God also empowered Paul to do all that

185
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.900
right? Christ called Paul to the ministry.

186
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.580
But God also empowered this ministry for Paul.

187
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.180
He wasn't out there on his own as he faced all those trials.

188
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.100
He was not by himself. God empowered it.

189
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.580
You see in this passage in Colossians one, Paul's struggle,

190
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.300
that word is used twice.

191
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.660
That's a word in the original language that we get our word agonizing from.

192
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.620
Like when you hear somebody who's agonizing over a decision or agonizing in this

193
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.220
pain, you know that's a deep, deep pain, right?

194
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.820
That's the struggle Paul's feeling.

195
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.420
But notice what he wrote in verse 29 for this ministry.

196
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.500
I toil that word is to pour himself out to exert deeply

197
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.020
struggling. He's agonizing like an athlete would.

198
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.700
When you're playing a an entire game at the end of the game, you're exhausted,

199
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.620
but you have to fight through it. That's what he's feeling here for this.

200
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.860
I toil struggling. Yet notice how he can do that

201
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.860
With all God's energy. He powerfully works within me.

202
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.900
Now I'm struggling, I'm fighting. I'm having to suffer.

203
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.540
How Paul understood. There's no way he could do any of this on his own.

204
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.640
There's no way he could face any of that on his own.

205
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.600
In fact, this is how he says it. In one Corinthians 15, 10,

206
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.880
he says, by the grace of God, I am what I am.

207
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.360
His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary,

208
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.760
I worked harder than any of them,

209
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.880
though it was not I, but the grace of God that is within me.

210
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.380
So this is not an out to say, yeah, just be lazy.

211
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.520
Just give up and just kind of sit around. God's gonna do the the work. No,

212
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.400
you still work harder. But it's not you.

213
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.320
It's God working in you and through you.

214
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.600
He knew he couldn't minister on his own.

215
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.480
That's why he had desperate dependence on God to say, God, you've gotta do this.

216
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.720
I can't minister to the Gentiles. I can't face this suffering.

217
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.200
You have to do this.

218
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.890
And so the power came just by God's spirit planting inside Paul.

219
00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.410
But but notice part of the power also came because of what Paul's ministry

220
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.450
contained. Look again at verse 28,

221
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.290
just the first part,

222
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:32.370
him we proclaim who's the hymn?

223
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:36.370
That's the hope of glory Christ in you that he just said in verse 27,

224
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.010
Christ is who he's proclaiming.

225
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.170
That was the primary task Paul had in his ministry, was to proclaim Christ

226
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.650
Him we proclaim.

227
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:54.170
And he does that because of the seeming foolishness

228
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:59.210
of this simple message. That's what shows God's power off.

229
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:01.490
I,

230
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:06.450
I love how Paul wrote about this in one Corinthians at the very beginning of

231
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.490
it, he, he mentions some things about wisdom and the way the world works.

232
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.450
And he says it this way, one Corinthians 1 21 through 24,

233
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.810
He says, for since in the wisdom of God,

234
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.730
the world did not know God through wisdom.

235
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.890
Meaning you can't just figure God out.

236
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:27.850
It please God through the folly foolishness of what we preach to save those

237
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:32.330
who believe. For Jews demand signs, Greeks seek wisdom.

238
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:37.370
But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews,

239
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.730
folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called both Jews and Greeks, Christ,

240
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.450
the power of God and the wisdom of God, right?

241
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.170
So he's saying this is the way the world doesn't think it's gonna work.

242
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.730
It's foolish to them that somebody would die and that counts for me.

243
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.610
But that's the power of God.

244
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.250
He goes on to say later in chapter two about his ministry,

245
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.530
he's talking here in the same vein. He says, I,

246
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:10.930
when I came to you did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with

247
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.290
lofty speech or wisdom.

248
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.570
For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and in crucified.

249
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.890
And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling my speech and my

250
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.770
message were not in plausible words of wisdom,

251
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.090
meaning arguments that make sense and always work. And always when he says, no,

252
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:31.840
it's not in that.

253
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.650
It's in demonstration of the spirit and of power so that your

254
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.090
faith might not rest in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

255
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.000
See, that's why Paul proclaimed Christ, Christ all the time for Paul,

256
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.960
because he wanted people to trust the one who can be trusted.

257
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.240
Not that Paul can win an argument or he's a great debater or or whatever.

258
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.320
He's a great speaker.

259
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.800
He didn't want him to trust in him or in that He wanted him to trust in Jesus

260
00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:07.200
who's the one who can be trusted. So he preaches Christ.

261
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:15.240
That was part of the power that he had. This Christ is the power of God.

262
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.240
It said, So Paul had power by the spirit inside of him.

263
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.920
He had power by Christ being preached. But don't miss this as well.

264
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.360
We don't,

265
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.160
we learned that Paul didn't just care about the Colossians intellectual

266
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.280
knowledge of Christ growing. Like here's the facts,

267
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.760
here's the information. You walk away with a greater knowledge. No,

268
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.000
he wanted their hearts to,

269
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.160
Paul wanted them to know Jesus,

270
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.280
but he also desired christlikeness in people.

271
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.480
And we see that here in Colossians one, right?

272
00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.120
He desired Christlikeness for those people.

273
00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.840
He was writing to verse 28. This is what Paul was toiling for,

274
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.320
struggling for in God's power.

275
00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.120
Him we proclaim warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom

276
00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.120
so that we may present everyone, mature in Christ.

277
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.280
That's his. So that statement is like, here's what I'm doing. Why?

278
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:23.120
So that you grow so that you mature even in chapter two,

279
00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.720
these people, he'd never even met his heart. His struggle was for this.

280
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.510
Verse two,

281
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:33.440
that their hearts may be encouraged being knit together in

282
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.250
love. Jews and Gentiles.

283
00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.930
Now one loving each other to reach all the riches of full assurance,

284
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:46.210
of understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ. See,

285
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:51.130
Paul understood that a person's faith is not meant to

286
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.250
stay in their head.

287
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.330
It's intended to actually show up in the way you live your life,

288
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.250
in your decisions you make, in the way that you love people,

289
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.730
the way that you decide and think about life and how you go forward with your

290
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.250
future. It's meant to,

291
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.810
to translate from your brain into your heart and change your life.

292
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.170
So many people grow up with an intellectual knowledge of Jesus.

293
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.530
You ask people on the street, at the mall, at the store, wherever,

294
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.290
like do they know Jesus died on the cross for their sins? Absolutely they do.

295
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.090
But it doesn't change their heart in any way.

296
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.540
That's what Paul's trying to get to.

297
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.380
He wants these people to be more like Christ,

298
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.580
to be more like that wisdom of God that Christ is.

299
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.460
That's what he agonized over and did everything he could to

300
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.100
bring about in those Colossians lives.

301
00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.040
That was Paul's ministry to the Colossians.

302
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:55.080
But does that have any relevance for us today? Like, okay, that was Paul.

303
00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.800
He was an apostle. So of course,

304
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.960
well actually the word in Colossians 1 23 for minister,

305
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.200
and then again in verse 25 ministry, it can mean apostle,

306
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.720
but it also all over the New Testament is used many different times for many

307
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.570
different people. People like Timothy, not an apostle

308
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.970
Ticus. We'll see him later in Colossians, even Phoebe, Romans 16.

309
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.930
It's even used about Jesus in Romans 15.

310
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.380
So that word can mean just a minister, a servant.

311
00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.420
Well, we add to that second Corinthians five,

312
00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.460
which says that if you've been reconciled to God,

313
00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.620
you have received this same ministry of reconciliation in the world

314
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.453
around us.

315
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.780
It calls you an ambassador of Christ.

316
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.420
You are pleading with others, God making his appeal through us.

317
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:06.220
This is what you and I have been called to. What that means is every moment,

318
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:11.180
every context, every way of life, we are to make God's kingdom evident.

319
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.660
We are ambassadors of Christ representing him and carrying his message to the

320
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:21.540
world around us and call others to follow him as well.

321
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.620
So, so I want you to hear this. If you are a Christian,

322
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.920
you are called to ministry too. Not just me,

323
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.840
not just those of us who get paid to do it. You believer are called to ministry.

324
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:43.290
That's why we sure better understand Paul's ministry so that

325
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:47.850
we can be informed how we are to do ministry. 'cause we're all going to do this.

326
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.850
And so as we're reminded of a few things here by Paul's ministry,

327
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.330
the first one is that the struggle is still real.

328
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:04.030
I feel it at more times than others, but, but the struggle in ministry is real.

329
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.390
Saw it for Paul. It's still true today.

330
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:12.430
Now I know you could do a search on Instagram or TikTok and you

331
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.750
can see the struggle is real, right? Like,

332
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.190
and we use that sarcastically a lot of times.

333
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.470
Like when Starbucks runs outta pumpkin spice, you're like, oh,

334
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.270
the struggle is real. You know, like that's, it's not the same thing.

335
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.830
We're being serious though,

336
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:31.270
when we talk about Paul and the struggle of ministry, right?

337
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.830
We're we still walk in struggle in ministry.

338
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:37.893
It's still hard.

339
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.920
If you are going to genuinely get involved in the work of the ministry of God,

340
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.000
you are going to see things get harder in your life.

341
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:55.780
It's a struggle because sometimes people turn their back on you.

342
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.610
It's a battle because sometimes you hurt someone and you need to go repent to

343
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.930
them. It, it's,

344
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.490
it's agonizing at times because that friend just goes back to that sin again

345
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:13.463
and again.

346
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.610
Sometimes it's a struggle because you're hitting brick wall after brick wall and

347
00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.850
people just will not listen.

348
00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:27.450
Their beliefs are too entrenched and you're trying and trying and trying and

349
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:28.283
nothing's happened.

350
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:35.870
And oftentimes it's hard just because the enemy hates that we're doing it.

351
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.750
And so he does everything he can to oppose,

352
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.550
to derail the work that we're trying to do for the Lord,

353
00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:51.150
to get us to fight one another instead of pointing our arrows at him.

354
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.500
Listen, the moment you step into the ministry of God,

355
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:04.140
the moment you step into trying to serve the Lord here at church or among the

356
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.540
nations or in your workplace or in your school, the moment you step into that,

357
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.340
you get a target on your back.

358
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.700
It's from the enemy. Yet,

359
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.540
do you remember how Paul responded beautifully to that struggle?

360
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.980
He knew it was true. He knew it was coming.

361
00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.780
What did he do instead as he faced the suffering and struggle? What does he say?

362
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.740
He rejoiced in it, right?

363
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.060
Not just after it was over. Not in spite of it. He says,

364
00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:42.100
I rejoice in my sufferings in the middle of

365
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.590
it. Do you know why he could say that?

366
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.150
Because that suffering,

367
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:52.710
that weakness drew him closer to the Lord than he could be any other

368
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:53.803
way.

369
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.303
I,

370
00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:01.670
I got an email this week from a church member who said this

371
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.910
as they look back on the pain that they've experienced in their life,

372
00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:10.630
listen to this great illustration, this this person said,

373
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:15.030
God revealed to me the most profound and life changing lessons during that

374
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.070
period about who God is,

375
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.310
how dependent and surrendered I must be to him.

376
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:27.510
I am forever grateful for the radical spiritual growth produced during that

377
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.343
time.

378
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:33.860
I would go through it all again if it meant reaping the

379
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.540
unequal eternal benefits I experienced.

380
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.740
I am forever grateful for my season of pain.

381
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.813
What an example.

382
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.890
Let let that person didn't run away from the pain.

383
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.810
'cause they couldn't avoid it. They sought Jesus in it

384
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:06.490
and saw how God intends that to move us toward him. Not away from him.

385
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.300
But I know you hear that. I read that. I was like, how is that even possible?

386
00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.873
How do you get there?

387
00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.430
That's why we've gotta remember that just like for Paul today,

388
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.030
the same thing is true.

389
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:28.430
The power is through God just as much today as it was for Paul.

390
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.550
The power is God's power today too.

391
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.990
The power to do ministry, the power to function,

392
00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.670
the power to go through hard times like that,

393
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:46.390
the power to do ministry for the Lord comes from the Lord.

394
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.910
Of course, it's a struggle. You will agonize as you care for people,

395
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.550
as you long for them to grow. That's going to be hard.

396
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.670
It's going to be a struggle.

397
00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.870
But remember what Colossians 1 29 says For this,

398
00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:04.670
I toil struggling with all his energy,

399
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.350
that he powerfully works within me.

400
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.270
Philippians two 13 reminds us,

401
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:16.030
it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good

402
00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.510
pleasure. It's God who works in you to do this.

403
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.950
Don't think you can come up with the strength or you have to come up with the

404
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:28.110
strength. It's God who empowers. Remember one Corinthians 12. We have do these,

405
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.550
all these different spiritual gifts, but it's God,

406
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.310
the same God who empowers them all.

407
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.670
Like when I preach this is God's power.

408
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.190
I shouldn't be trying to do this in my power at all. Get outta the way.

409
00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:42.550
Let God do it. When you teach kids on Sundays or Wednesdays,

410
00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.470
it's God's power working through you.

411
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.670
When you share the gospel with somebody at school or at work, it's God's power.

412
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.470
When you stand here after the service and welcome one another as Christ welcomed

413
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:54.950
you, that's God's power.

414
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.990
When you give sacrificially, that's God's power.

415
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.350
God empowers those gifts.

416
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.430
Listen and, and listen. I needed this one. What I'm about to say this week,

417
00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.830
it's God speaking to me first.

418
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.710
There's no way that you can endure the struggle of

419
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.830
ministry without relying on God's power to work through you.

420
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.840
There's no way, this is too hard.

421
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:29.760
There's too much at stake with without relying on God's energizing power

422
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.480
working within you, you're gonna bail

423
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:40.500
when things don't go your way, someone criticizes you.

424
00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:45.680
When that friend turns back to their sin again,

425
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.320
you're gonna throw in the towel.

426
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.090
It's the way it works 'cause you can't handle it.

427
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.050
You're not strong enough

428
00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:00.973
unless,

429
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.600
unless you're relying on God's power,

430
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:11.540
not on your power. It's the only way.

431
00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.020
Just like for Paul, same for you.

432
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.620
So he and we receive the spiritual power from God

433
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.780
inside us to continue. But we also have a source of power that he had as well.

434
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.200
Remember, part of the power that he had

435
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.600
comes from the content of our ministry that's the same as his.

436
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:40.400
It's still Christ. Christ. The power of God.

437
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.360
The wisdom of God is still our content,

438
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:47.040
which means it's still power for us today. Our content is Christ too.

439
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.160
We are just as called as Paul to make the word of God fully known,

440
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.320
to proclaim the Messiah Jesus as the culmination of this,

441
00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:02.320
this gloriously rich mystery that is now revealed in Jesus.

442
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.520
We stand up, you one-on-one, whatever it is you write on social media.

443
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:12.000
This is the opportunity to declare, proclaim Christ the power of God.

444
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:18.570
The mystery now revealed, listen,

445
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.810
that means we've gotta be very careful not to drift toward other content.

446
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.930
Things that might sound like this is gonna work, this is gonna help us.

447
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:33.730
We can't drift away from being anchored in God's word,

448
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.450
which reveals Christ as our Lord and Savior

449
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.490
Christ is our content.

450
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.210
Just like it was for Paul because what that content does hear me

451
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.610
just like the Father designed this to work,

452
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.890
is it should lead us toward the same goal that Paul had back then as well.

453
00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:56.050
Remember, his goal for the Colossians, for the La Ians was for maturity.

454
00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.820
That's what he wanted for them. That's what we should want for each other.

455
00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:07.680
Maturity. As we proclaim Christ, we teach everyone,

456
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.600
we warn everyone,

457
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:13.160
it's done with an eye toward presenting everyone to be mature

458
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:18.480
in Christ, to be more like Christ on the other side of ministry.

459
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.160
Listen, I don't want you to,

460
00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:26.360
we don't want you to walk away from this or from any

461
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:31.400
gathering of the church with just merely a greater knowledge.

462
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:36.800
Like if you're studying this at home or maybe you're at a Christian school and

463
00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.640
and you just have this greater knowledge,

464
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.880
that's all you grow in is you just know these things about God.

465
00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.000
That's not the goal.

466
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.720
Any understanding you gain should lead to greater obedience,

467
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.640
should lead to look more like Jesus.

468
00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.280
Listen, in fact, that's the way Paul writes

469
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.600
in Ephesians four about whenever you are fulfilling your ministry,

470
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.200
that's actually the end game of this. That's the goal of when you've minister.

471
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.040
It helps all of our growth. Ephesians four 11 through 16,

472
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.760
God gave the apostles, prophets, evangelists,

473
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.440
shepherds and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry,

474
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.880
for building up the body of Christ

475
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.960
until we all attain to the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of

476
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.320
God, to mature manhood to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,

477
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:37.520
so that we may no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves and carried

478
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.920
about by every wind of doctrine, human cunning crafting us in deceitful schemes.

479
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.400
Rather speaking the truth in love. We are to grow up in every way into him.

480
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:52.400
Who is the head into Christ from whom the whole body joined and

481
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.360
held together by every joint with which it is equipped,

482
00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:59.360
when each part is working properly makes the body grow

483
00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.360
so that it builds itself up in love.

484
00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.440
See that your, your role as a minister,

485
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:10.770
the goal of that is maturity

486
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:15.650
in all the ways we just read, all the things that you grow into.

487
00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:20.010
He says in Ephesians four, that's the goal of you being a minister.

488
00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:25.770
And even later in Ephesians, he describes that maturity. He,

489
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:29.330
he explains what maturity looks like. He says it's, it's less gossip,

490
00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:35.110
it's less anger, less lying, less,

491
00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.790
less lusting, more encouragement, more serving,

492
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:44.230
more trusting in the Lord. That's maturity.

493
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.800
I'm gonna say something and I, I believe that's true,

494
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:54.160
that true ministry is not happening if we're not seeing

495
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.120
progressive sanctification in people's lives. That's what that says.

496
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.240
True ministry is not happening if we're not seeing now.

497
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.720
Now I'm not saying immediate perfection 'cause that's not gonna happen, but,

498
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.750
but Christ-like progress over time that that's what this is

499
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.030
saying we should be seeing. Now, I dunno about you,

500
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.590
but in my life that's an up and down journey over the years.

501
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:27.030
But this says generally the trend over the long haul

502
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.230
is up and the right.

503
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.800
Like it might look like this along the way

504
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.120
But, but

505
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.800
Generally you can track it up into the the right over time that you become more

506
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.800
Christlike through the years.

507
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.000
That's the ultimate end game of ministry.

508
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.940
Now, when you look at this picture of ministry that I've painted,

509
00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.620
I realize it might not sound very appealing. It's gonna be really hard,

510
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.020
pain, suffering. Alright,

511
00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.980
everybody go sign up for ministry out there in the lobby.

512
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.820
So why in the world should we even consider doing this?

513
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.260
Why would anyone want to be involved in God's ministry?

514
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.100
Why should we do this? Well, first of all,

515
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:23.900
first and foremost, it's because of God's call,

516
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:28.380
God's command and we want to obey him because we love him, right? That's,

517
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.940
that's first and foremost. That has to be base level.

518
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.500
But we also have to remember Paul's perspective on all this.

519
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.140
As hard as it was for him,

520
00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.020
you saw how much harder it is for him than it was for us in any way.

521
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.540
The struggle he felt, yet again, Colossians 1 24,

522
00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.900
I rejoice in my sufferings for your

523
00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:57.580
sake, for the Colossians,

524
00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:02.180
he's suffering for their good. Chapter two verse five.

525
00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:07.020
He's rejoicing to see good order. The firmness of their faith in Christ.

526
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.100
In other words, he saw it all as worth it.

527
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:14.220
When he saw what happened in them, we saw what God did in them. He's like,

528
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.060
it's worth it. I'll do whatever it takes

529
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.820
because he saw his reward.

530
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.580
Like Christ saw the reward for the joy set before him. He endured the cross,

531
00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.540
right? It's the same thing for Paul, for the joy set before him.

532
00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.140
He endured the sufferings of Christ for the ministry.

533
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.220
We've gotta remember the same thing.

534
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:37.140
It's true for us as well as we fulfill this ministry of reconciliation.

535
00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.700
The same reward is out there for us. It's joy,

536
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:45.700
it's obedience to Christ. Yes, but it's also, Hey, you want joy?

537
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.540
I know we're all seeking joy. It's life. It's what we do.

538
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.780
Here's how you find it.

539
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:57.490
Here's one way you find joy. It's first of all in Christ.

540
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.570
As you obey him,

541
00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:02.610
you feel his pleasure When you're pursuing the purpose for your life, right?

542
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.950
You,

543
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:07.730
you feel his joy on you as you obey it's

544
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.210
chariots of fire. Eric Liddell,

545
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:12.050
I feel God's pleasure when I run 'cause he made me fast, right?

546
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.690
It's the same thing as God made you to do something. You feel his pleasure.

547
00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:18.770
When you do it, you feel his joy. When you do it,

548
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.890
You get that joy.

549
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:26.410
But also the joy you get is you see fruit in others'

550
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:31.170
lives. Like the elder in Third John, he says,

551
00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:35.440
I have no greater joy than to hear that my spiritual children are walking in the

552
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.273
truth.

553
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:43.560
Paul calls the Philippians his joy and crown and he's looking

554
00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.800
at people growing as the joy he has.

555
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.560
And lemme just let you in a little secret.

556
00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.800
You can feel that joy too.

557
00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.620
It doesn't matter how old you are,

558
00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.900
it doesn't matter what skills you have or what training you have,

559
00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.740
you can feel that kind of joy in ministry.

560
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:08.360
Listen,

561
00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:13.150
there is nothing like investing in someone else and watching God grow them up

562
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.990
into maturity.

563
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.480
It's just stunning life-giving.

564
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:24.680
There's nothing like spending time teaching kids about who Jesus is about his

565
00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:29.000
word and seeing light bulbs come on in their little brains. It's so sweet.

566
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:34.320
Like there's nothing like walking up to someone in here,

567
00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.040
somebody you don't know very well but is new and they need to connect to the

568
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.200
church and you welcome them. You care for them.

569
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.680
You build a relationship with them and you watch them connect to the church and

570
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:48.040
grow All because you walked across the room and said, Hey, what's your name?

571
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.080
There's nothing like sitting with someone in deep pain.

572
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.880
You're not even saying anything yet.

573
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:04.200
They know that you are helping carry them through that season.

574
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.200
The gratitude they have. It is so sweet

575
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:14.400
and so you get joy when other people grow and you're a part of.

576
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.800
You get to see God use you.

577
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:21.970
But then think of the joy as well whenever you see your own growth,

578
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.570
because God grows you just as much through all of this process of ministry as he

579
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.650
does anybody else. It's what Romans five,

580
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:34.650
three through five says that we rejoice in our sufferings. Now,

581
00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:39.090
that's persecution, that's trouble from the enemy, all those things,

582
00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:43.890
but it's also Paul says in ministry we rejoice in our sufferings knowing that

583
00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:47.330
suffering produces endurance. Endurance produces character,

584
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.010
and character produces hope.

585
00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:52.330
And hope does not put us to shame 'cause God's love has been poured into our

586
00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.130
hearts through the Holy Spirit has been given to us.

587
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:59.890
He rejoices in his sufferings even in ministry because he knows in him that's

588
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.650
gonna produce good forever.

589
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.600
And listen, I know when you think about ministry,

590
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.800
I know you're not gonna minister perfectly all the time.

591
00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.880
I fail at this a lot as well.

592
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.080
Every week I stand up here and I stumble over words and I say things like,

593
00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.200
oh man, I wish I would've said that differently. Like during the week.

594
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.200
I don't care for people Well every single time, like I don't pray enough,

595
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.560
I shrink back from hard conversations with people.

596
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.520
I waste time doing silly stuff.

597
00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.080
We all will fail at this. But listen,

598
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:40.880
this joy can still come in ministry when you and I consider

599
00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.680
how God in his grace has granted his approval and his blessings

600
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.880
despite your insufficiency.

601
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:54.200
Like think about this. God could have done this in any other way

602
00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.400
to make his mystery known to see people grow and immature.

603
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:03.680
He could done it any other way. Yet he chose to use sinful, weak,

604
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.520
failing human beings like you and me

605
00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.353
I,

606
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.120
And praise God for that, right?

607
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:13.800
That he would choose to use weak vessels.

608
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:17.040
That's why it's got to be his strength that we minister in.

609
00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.120
But it also must be his gospel that we minister in.

610
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:29.410
As you remember that even your failures in ministry are forgiven through Jesus

611
00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:33.890
Christ. Even when you don't do it perfectly, don't do it fulfilled.

612
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.290
All of that, hear me,

613
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:40.290
your joy and salvation do not depend on you ministering perfectly.

614
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.370
Your joy and salvation depend on Christ alone.

615
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:53.090
That's what gives you the ability to stand firm as you minister.

616
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:58.570
That's what gives you the ability to stay firm as you serve, as you reach out,

617
00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.090
as you do what God's called you to.

618
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.450
That's what gives you that ability because Christ is strong enough to be your

619
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:04.283
foundation

620
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:10.130
and you can walk his path He's called you to with full joy

621
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:15.670
of what he's doing in and through you. So let's be minister's, church.
