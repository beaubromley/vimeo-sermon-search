1
00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:01.685
Alright, good evening.

2
00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:07.045
Good evening. Howdy to, yay, howdy.

3
00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:11.405
That was different. Now, welcome to, uh,

4
00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:12.965
Wednesday night at Henderson Hills.

5
00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:14.805
Our equipping nights we call 'em.

6
00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:17.365
And, uh, our goal is to fulfill

7
00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:19.685
what our mission statement says, to equip one another,

8
00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:21.125
to love Jesus and live sin.

9
00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:23.405
So part of that is these classes

10
00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:25.685
that we do regularly throughout the semesters.

11
00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:29.205
So, as you probably know, there's some classes going on

12
00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:30.365
outside of this one.

13
00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:35.405
One is actually enabling somebody to get seminary credit

14
00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:37.485
for a class if you wanted to do that.

15
00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:39.725
That's, uh, going on in one of these rooms out here

16
00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:42.045
through Midwestern Seminary.

17
00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:43.725
So, uh, it's called The Story of Everything.

18
00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:47.365
Jared Wilson teaches that it's really encouraging, really a,

19
00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.285
a good study and men's women's

20
00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:50.405
bible studies going on as well.

21
00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:53.525
But, uh, what we're doing with this one in here is

22
00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:55.565
calling it digging deeper.

23
00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:57.485
And so the idea is to take

24
00:00:57.595 --> 00:01:01.005
what topic was preached about on Sunday, whether that's me

25
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.005
or someone else preaching that to come.

26
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.965
Then in here again, just try to recap through what that

27
00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:10.845
theological topic was, and then dig deeper into it.

28
00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:13.685
Talk about some of the, some of the things we couldn't get

29
00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:16.405
to on Sunday, some of the deeper nuances,

30
00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:19.485
and maybe even some of the, the, uh, debates

31
00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:21.205
that go on about that topic.

32
00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:23.485
Some things that you might not be aware of,

33
00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:24.525
things you might be aware of.

34
00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:27.885
All of that we wanna do what we can to help equip you

35
00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:31.165
with the theological, uh, studies that you need

36
00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:32.605
to grow in your faith.

37
00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:34.525
Because again, we talked about this Sunday,

38
00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:37.125
the idea is not just to grow in our mental knowledge.

39
00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:40.125
The, the idea is to grow in our knowledge of the God,

40
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.205
of the universe who's come to us to save us.

41
00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:46.845
And that should be life giving and, uh, joy inducing.

42
00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:48.405
So that's why we study theology.

43
00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:51.765
We want to know who God is better so

44
00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:54.965
that we can grow in him more effectively

45
00:01:55.065 --> 00:01:58.565
and follow his mission for us, uh, more faithfully.

46
00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:01.085
So what, what I wanna start with tonight,

47
00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:04.285
before we get into all that, is, uh, a time of prayer.

48
00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:06.685
As you know, we've done this the last week plus to

49
00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:10.045
devote ourselves to prayer more, to care more.

50
00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:12.005
Tomorrow at noon, right in this room,

51
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.845
we're gonna have a time of prayer that if you can be here

52
00:02:14.845 --> 00:02:17.845
for that, it'd be a sweet time, I'm sure, to just meet

53
00:02:17.845 --> 00:02:19.445
with the Lord, be still

54
00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:23.765
before him, worship him, grow in our knowledge

55
00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:24.885
of his word a little bit there.

56
00:02:24.885 --> 00:02:26.125
But also just follow his spirit

57
00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:27.765
and how he wants us to pray,

58
00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:29.605
what he's already praying for us.

59
00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:32.245
So Thursday's at noon, we're gonna start that rhythm

60
00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:33.685
for the foreseeable future.

61
00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:35.645
Love to have you that. But we want to also

62
00:02:36.305 --> 00:02:40.565
infuse more prayer into our daily regular gatherings,

63
00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:43.965
weekly gatherings, just to say, Lord, we need you.

64
00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:45.805
And we can't do this without you.

65
00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:47.725
Uh, so tonight we're gonna do that just

66
00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:49.045
for a little bit to start with.

67
00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:51.045
Do that probably every Wednesday night similarly,

68
00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:53.045
but, uh, just to calm our spirits.

69
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.125
So just if you would bow your heads, close your eyes.

70
00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:57.005
There's nothing super spiritual about doing that.

71
00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:58.845
Of course, we typically do that in churches.

72
00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:02.685
But just the idea is to calm

73
00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:05.245
and quiet your spirit before the Lord

74
00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.725
and realize that, uh, all the stuff that's happened today,

75
00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:11.685
all the things that you're thinking about, all the worries

76
00:03:12.595 --> 00:03:16.285
that you can lay all of that at his feet right now

77
00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:19.965
and just ask him for his unique

78
00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:23.325
presence with you right now.

79
00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:48.055
Ask him for eyes to see,

80
00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:52.215
even with your heart, eyes, to see what you want,

81
00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:55.575
what he wants you to see tonight from his word,

82
00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:57.775
from, uh, conversations.

83
00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:00.935
What does he want you to see? Ask him for it.

84
00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:26.885
I just confess to him right now that, uh,

85
00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:31.285
as we'll talk about here in a moment, that you have not

86
00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:36.285
desired him as much as you know, you shouldn't.

87
00:04:36.305 --> 00:04:41.125
You should have, uh, all of us confess that God,

88
00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:45.505
we, we don't long for you very well.

89
00:04:46.975 --> 00:04:49.425
Confess that to him and receive his love in

90
00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:50.745
that, in spite of that.

91
00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:24.235
And just ask him now to lead you in the way everlasting in

92
00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:28.915
Psalm 39 says, his eternal, true right

93
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.405
way of living, of thinking.

94
00:05:50.135 --> 00:05:52.065
Well, we thank you for the time tonight.

95
00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:53.625
You've given us, we don't take it for granted,

96
00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:55.025
that we get to do this freely here.

97
00:05:55.325 --> 00:05:58.925
And, uh, we have, have the facility to have

98
00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:02.165
what we have tonight with kids and students

99
00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:04.405
and other classes happening

100
00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.565
and joyful sound choir, practicing,

101
00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:10.925
and, uh, just the opportunities we have to do this.

102
00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:14.425
God, we don't take that lightly, that we have the word

103
00:06:15.005 --> 00:06:19.745
in our language, that we have people to encourage us

104
00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:22.945
with it and teach us and talk to us and challenge us.

105
00:06:24.765 --> 00:06:29.105
We have books in our language that teach us, show us truths.

106
00:06:29.635 --> 00:06:33.985
Thank you, God. So may we

107
00:06:34.525 --> 00:06:36.545
see you tonight a little better,

108
00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:40.025
a little differently In Jesus' name.

109
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:45.505
Amen. So one

110
00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:49.065
of the things I want to do, we want to do every week is,

111
00:06:49.165 --> 00:06:53.785
is give you some resources just for follow up for things

112
00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:56.905
that you might not have known existed, books,

113
00:06:57.585 --> 00:06:58.705
articles, if we can.

114
00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:02.905
But, uh, so there'll be usually a stack of books right here

115
00:07:03.085 --> 00:07:05.745
of some sort that you may or may not be able to read,

116
00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:07.385
but, uh, from where you are.

117
00:07:07.485 --> 00:07:11.505
But, uh, but try to talk through, uh, I've struck,

118
00:07:11.555 --> 00:07:13.745
lemme just be clear, I have trouble reading these myself.

119
00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:17.385
So actual books of these, the, especially this top one.

120
00:07:17.485 --> 00:07:20.865
Um, but if you're looking for further study

121
00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:23.665
to dig into the topics that we're talking about,

122
00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:25.505
you'll have some, some help here.

123
00:07:25.505 --> 00:07:27.625
These are general systematic theologies, meaning

124
00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:32.665
they take these concepts of, of who God is

125
00:07:32.725 --> 00:07:34.105
and what sin is.

126
00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:36.505
And, and they, they try to systematize

127
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:42.545
that topic with what God's word holistically teaches.

128
00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:45.305
And so they do, uh, that of course.

129
00:07:45.325 --> 00:07:47.825
And it takes a long, a lot of pages to get there.

130
00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:49.425
And so these books are thick.

131
00:07:49.925 --> 00:07:52.025
Uh, most systematic theologies are thick.

132
00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:54.305
But, but these are a couple of the really good ones.

133
00:07:54.555 --> 00:07:58.665
These bottom two, uh, bird and Erickson are especially good.

134
00:07:58.735 --> 00:08:03.665
This top one is really, really hard to read. Uh, for me.

135
00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:08.585
It's, it's really deep and rich. But, but, uh, he, bath Inc.

136
00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:11.945
Is his name is, um, is one of the best on the subject

137
00:08:11.945 --> 00:08:13.945
that we're talking about tonight about Revelation,

138
00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:16.865
God's general revelation, special revelation.

139
00:08:16.965 --> 00:08:19.025
So, again, you don't have to buy these, you don't have,

140
00:08:19.025 --> 00:08:20.265
but I've just given you ideas,

141
00:08:20.275 --> 00:08:22.025
given you some resources for that.

142
00:08:23.005 --> 00:08:24.945
But here's, here's what I want to kinda start with,

143
00:08:24.965 --> 00:08:27.105
is we kicked off the series on Sunday.

144
00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:29.665
We had the jar, we put the rock in it.

145
00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:31.625
Our first big rock, of course is revelation.

146
00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:33.505
But, but as we think about this whole series,

147
00:08:33.535 --> 00:08:35.065
when you think about first things first,

148
00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:38.065
and these heavy theological concepts we're gonna talk

149
00:08:38.065 --> 00:08:39.145
about over the next couple months,

150
00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:43.345
Uh, For some of you, these are new infor,

151
00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:44.705
this is all new information.

152
00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.825
And so it might feel like it's way up here

153
00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:49.305
and you're trying to swim too deep

154
00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:52.345
and all this, just, just look for what God's gonna show you,

155
00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:56.485
uh, from Sunday, which we'll try to, try to keep it

156
00:08:57.625 --> 00:09:00.885
not simplistic, but, but more simple, right?

157
00:09:01.105 --> 00:09:04.205
To understand, catch something.

158
00:09:04.425 --> 00:09:05.885
But then even on these evenings,

159
00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:06.965
just look for what God's shown.

160
00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:08.045
That's why we prayed that at the beginning.

161
00:09:08.045 --> 00:09:10.325
Look for what God wants to show you. Have his eyes.

162
00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:12.285
Uh, maybe it's just one thing,

163
00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.285
how you can apply that and love him better.

164
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:19.165
But others of you might feel like, man, this is all old hat,

165
00:09:19.635 --> 00:09:21.205
like you're coming in here with,

166
00:09:21.675 --> 00:09:24.045
with almost like stump the pastor questions.

167
00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:26.285
You know what the, the topic is, right?

168
00:09:26.305 --> 00:09:28.045
And, and so let's just be clear, let's,

169
00:09:28.045 --> 00:09:29.125
that's not the goal tonight, right?

170
00:09:29.145 --> 00:09:31.965
You don't, uh, the goal is information expert, uh,

171
00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:33.245
for transformation.

172
00:09:34.025 --> 00:09:36.805
But it, it might seem like some

173
00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:38.605
of this stuff is too basic for you.

174
00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.205
'cause you've studied, you've done great, okay?

175
00:09:42.025 --> 00:09:43.085
And that you already know.

176
00:09:44.265 --> 00:09:47.885
But the question is, do you really do, do I really

177
00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:49.925
understand these things?

178
00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:55.605
Has it taken root in my life and born good fruit?

179
00:09:57.965 --> 00:09:59.905
Any of these topics, all these topics, has it,

180
00:09:59.925 --> 00:10:01.665
has it really born good fruit?

181
00:10:01.725 --> 00:10:05.105
Do I rejoice over these truths?

182
00:10:06.035 --> 00:10:08.645
Like when we hear about God's self revelation, is

183
00:10:08.645 --> 00:10:10.645
that something that causes us to rejoice?

184
00:10:10.645 --> 00:10:12.485
Or do we just merely think about kind

185
00:10:12.485 --> 00:10:13.765
of the academic study of it?

186
00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:15.765
If if it doesn't lead us to that,

187
00:10:16.635 --> 00:10:18.885
then maybe we don't know it as well as we thought we did.

188
00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:22.595
I mean, 'cause Romans talks about

189
00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:25.155
how God's love is poured into our hearts,

190
00:10:26.935 --> 00:10:29.995
and that leads us to rejoice at these things,

191
00:10:32.345 --> 00:10:33.925
not to be defensive or,

192
00:10:34.705 --> 00:10:37.765
or not to be like, apathetic about these truths either.

193
00:10:37.835 --> 00:10:39.485
Like we shouldn't just forget it.

194
00:10:39.525 --> 00:10:41.165
I don't need, I'm not a theologian, actually,

195
00:10:41.425 --> 00:10:42.445
all of us are, right?

196
00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:44.725
And just dismiss this stuff.

197
00:10:44.785 --> 00:10:47.125
No, we have to think like, I, I should care,

198
00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:51.365
but we shouldn't be combative about any of this either

199
00:10:51.365 --> 00:10:56.085
because this is not then fruit God would produce of worship

200
00:10:56.825 --> 00:10:59.245
and of love for others.

201
00:11:00.265 --> 00:11:03.165
So that's the goal is as we study these theological concepts

202
00:11:03.165 --> 00:11:04.445
to get to that, and now we're gonna have

203
00:11:04.445 --> 00:11:05.965
to put the big rocks in first.

204
00:11:06.405 --> 00:11:09.205
Remember the, the, the illustration is we can't focus on the

205
00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:10.925
secondary and third level things first

206
00:11:10.925 --> 00:11:14.445
because then we crowd out the big rocks that we need

207
00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:17.205
to put in first that are the essentials of our faith.

208
00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:18.805
So that's what we're gonna get to.

209
00:11:18.805 --> 00:11:21.205
The first seven of these are the big rocks.

210
00:11:21.545 --> 00:11:24.325
And keep filling up that jar from there.

211
00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:27.445
Because again, as Jude says, this is the faith once

212
00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:30.005
for all delivered to the saints the faith.

213
00:11:30.005 --> 00:11:32.605
That's a, a definitive article, right?

214
00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:35.285
It's the, like, you watch those, um,

215
00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.205
the introductions at football games when they flash the guys

216
00:11:38.205 --> 00:11:40.125
on the screen and they say where they're from,

217
00:11:40.355 --> 00:11:41.925
some high school or some college, right?

218
00:11:42.515 --> 00:11:44.765
What, what's the one, uh,

219
00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:48.125
Michigan versus the team down South?

220
00:11:49.035 --> 00:11:50.445
Gray Buckeyes, right?

221
00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:54.525
The Ohio State University, they say, right,

222
00:11:56.385 --> 00:12:00.925
the faith, the God of the universe, not just one of many.

223
00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:04.645
The and so the faith we're talking about is the thing

224
00:12:04.645 --> 00:12:07.485
that Jude says the first things, this is the most important,

225
00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:10.725
the common salvation that Ephesians four talks about.

226
00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.925
The one faith, one Lord, one.

227
00:12:13.185 --> 00:12:14.925
That's what we're trying to get to here.

228
00:12:15.715 --> 00:12:16.965
There's differences of opinion

229
00:12:16.985 --> 00:12:18.205
on all of these kinds of things.

230
00:12:18.265 --> 00:12:20.085
But what we're saying with these is

231
00:12:20.085 --> 00:12:21.525
that these are the essentials

232
00:12:21.715 --> 00:12:24.205
that make us distinctly Christian.

233
00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:28.535
That there's gonna be very little wiggle room

234
00:12:30.355 --> 00:12:32.415
on these essentials, right?

235
00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:36.215
There'll be some differences of application maybe or thing.

236
00:12:36.395 --> 00:12:41.175
But if we don't believe that God has revealed himself

237
00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:45.195
to us in these ways, then what are we doing here?

238
00:12:45.775 --> 00:12:46.915
And, and who are we worshiping?

239
00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:49.435
And we'll see some of these other things we go forward

240
00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.235
with the trinity and with God the son,

241
00:12:51.295 --> 00:12:52.795
and, and what is salvation?

242
00:12:52.895 --> 00:12:54.315
And we'll explain all of that.

243
00:12:54.415 --> 00:12:55.915
And how do we view humans

244
00:12:56.015 --> 00:12:59.315
and how do we view the last things, uh, the essential parts

245
00:12:59.315 --> 00:13:01.115
of that, not the debates, we'll get into that, but,

246
00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:04.915
but the essential parts of Jesus is coming back to judge.

247
00:13:05.655 --> 00:13:09.035
We can't deny that and still be called Christian.

248
00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:10.115
You see, that's what we're talking about,

249
00:13:10.115 --> 00:13:12.035
these big rocks that we'll get to.

250
00:13:13.055 --> 00:13:14.035
Now again, we're not gonna say

251
00:13:14.035 --> 00:13:14.915
everything about all of these.

252
00:13:15.415 --> 00:13:18.275
Uh, we're gonna try to dig deeper into it in these Wednesday

253
00:13:18.275 --> 00:13:21.355
nights, but again, we can't get to everything.

254
00:13:21.815 --> 00:13:24.635
But that's why I wanted to make this tonight.

255
00:13:24.775 --> 00:13:27.115
And, and each one of us as we go forward in the next few

256
00:13:27.115 --> 00:13:30.435
weeks, a lot more focused on the q and a.

257
00:13:31.635 --> 00:13:33.875
'cause we can sit up here and we can kind of assume what,

258
00:13:33.945 --> 00:13:35.875
what you kind of wanna know the questions

259
00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:37.635
that might be asked, and we'll give some,

260
00:13:37.945 --> 00:13:40.435
some additional information of course, then Sundays.

261
00:13:40.435 --> 00:13:42.235
But, but there's also like, Hey,

262
00:13:42.235 --> 00:13:43.955
what are the questions you would need

263
00:13:44.315 --> 00:13:46.075
answered about these things?

264
00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:47.955
And we'll try to answer 'em. We can't have all the answers.

265
00:13:47.965 --> 00:13:51.075
We're not, uh, omniscient that God is, we're not.

266
00:13:51.135 --> 00:13:52.835
But we'll try to answer as we'll.

267
00:13:52.835 --> 00:13:55.115
Have a panel of elders up here every week, try

268
00:13:55.115 --> 00:13:56.315
to answer from God's word.

269
00:13:57.145 --> 00:14:00.515
Help you understand what that means. So that's the goal.

270
00:14:00.515 --> 00:14:02.435
So be thinking as you're thinking about

271
00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:03.795
what I'm talking about tonight,

272
00:14:03.795 --> 00:14:05.275
what we talked about Sunday, what are some questions?

273
00:14:05.275 --> 00:14:06.795
We'll try to leave enough time for that.

274
00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:09.595
Uh, pretty good chunk of time for

275
00:14:09.595 --> 00:14:11.355
that actually each week to get to that.

276
00:14:12.425 --> 00:14:15.795
Okay? So all that, uh, is the preface

277
00:14:15.795 --> 00:14:18.915
before we get to the concept of revelation.

278
00:14:19.655 --> 00:14:21.995
Now, it's not the last book of your Bible.

279
00:14:22.455 --> 00:14:25.435
The revelation of John is the last book, uh,

280
00:14:25.435 --> 00:14:27.755
that we call Revelation, or some people put an S on that.

281
00:14:27.865 --> 00:14:31.115
It's actually not an s it's the revelation, uh, of John.

282
00:14:31.815 --> 00:14:35.315
But it, it's merely when you, we don't use that word a lot,

283
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:39.395
but revealed God revealed something to John

284
00:14:40.165 --> 00:14:41.595
about the future.

285
00:14:43.055 --> 00:14:47.515
So we have God having revealed himself.

286
00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:49.435
So we call it the revelation.

287
00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:51.620
And we start with this, like I said, Sunday,

288
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.685
because if we start with the doctrine of God, well,

289
00:14:56.025 --> 00:14:57.965
the doctrine of revelation is

290
00:14:57.965 --> 00:14:59.725
how we know anything about God.

291
00:15:00.585 --> 00:15:03.565
So we, we start here, other people flip that, okay?

292
00:15:03.565 --> 00:15:05.005
Each of these books does that differently.

293
00:15:05.585 --> 00:15:09.365
But we decided, okay, revelation first to know who God is.

294
00:15:09.425 --> 00:15:10.805
And so we saw that in a couple ways.

295
00:15:11.165 --> 00:15:12.605
Remember first was general revelation.

296
00:15:13.065 --> 00:15:15.765
So we got into Psalm 19, if you remember that

297
00:15:16.495 --> 00:15:18.965
David wrote this general revelation.

298
00:15:19.545 --> 00:15:22.685
Uh, we talked about God's natural revelation of himself.

299
00:15:22.795 --> 00:15:25.245
This, this idea of looking around at creation

300
00:15:25.345 --> 00:15:27.245
and seeing things about God

301
00:15:27.555 --> 00:15:32.525
that he has built into the fabric of nature of our bodies,

302
00:15:32.785 --> 00:15:34.125
of our selves.

303
00:15:34.185 --> 00:15:36.805
And it said things like declaring the glory of God.

304
00:15:37.225 --> 00:15:41.605
The sky proclaims shows his creative handwork each day, uh,

305
00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.725
burps out the glory of God, right?

306
00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:47.165
That belch is the word in, uh, verse two,

307
00:15:47.315 --> 00:15:49.965
each night reveals, declares knowledge about God.

308
00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:53.125
Here's one quote I didn't use, Sonny Matthew Henry said,

309
00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:56.645
the continual success of the day

310
00:15:56.785 --> 00:15:59.325
and night, meaning it never stops, right?

311
00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.925
The continual success of the day

312
00:16:00.925 --> 00:16:03.685
and night is sufficient to declare God's power in goodness

313
00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.125
that this thing just keeps going.

314
00:16:08.565 --> 00:16:12.725
Cyclical pattern, day, night, day, night, day night.

315
00:16:13.075 --> 00:16:17.725
It's enough to prove and declare God's power and goodness.

316
00:16:20.535 --> 00:16:22.925
Verse three talked about the nature declaring God's glory.

317
00:16:22.925 --> 00:16:26.285
It's all audible everywhere the words go out like the suns

318
00:16:26.315 --> 00:16:28.085
heat covering the whole earth.

319
00:16:30.225 --> 00:16:34.285
And so you think about, okay, how does it tell us about God?

320
00:16:36.145 --> 00:16:39.755
Well, uh, this theologian named Theodore of Cyrus,

321
00:16:39.785 --> 00:16:43.915
back in the four hundreds, he said, like,

322
00:16:43.915 --> 00:16:47.905
when you see a great painting, you're,

323
00:16:47.905 --> 00:16:49.185
you're in awe of the painting.

324
00:16:49.285 --> 00:16:51.345
But you're also, your mind goes to like,

325
00:16:51.425 --> 00:16:52.505
I wonder who painted it.

326
00:16:53.605 --> 00:16:56.435
Right? You see how that he, he's saying, a an awesome

327
00:16:56.955 --> 00:16:59.955
painting makes you think about the master

328
00:16:59.955 --> 00:17:01.155
artist who painted it.

329
00:17:02.825 --> 00:17:04.995
When we look at creation, we're like, wow, I wonder

330
00:17:05.445 --> 00:17:06.715
where this came from.

331
00:17:07.255 --> 00:17:10.795
You might say much more to be sure.

332
00:17:10.815 --> 00:17:13.715
He says, does the sight of creation lead the viewers

333
00:17:13.735 --> 00:17:17.315
to the creator just looking at this, right?

334
00:17:19.615 --> 00:17:20.995
We can't be help. It can't help

335
00:17:20.995 --> 00:17:23.235
but be stunned at how great God really is.

336
00:17:23.695 --> 00:17:27.435
And so that's intended to humble us. We're not God. He is.

337
00:17:28.585 --> 00:17:29.795
It's all about the greatness of God,

338
00:17:29.795 --> 00:17:30.835
not the significance of man.

339
00:17:30.855 --> 00:17:32.395
God made man small, the universe big

340
00:17:32.395 --> 00:17:33.515
to say something about himself.

341
00:17:34.145 --> 00:17:36.915
It's not about us. We shouldn't think it is.

342
00:17:36.925 --> 00:17:40.715
We're small in the end compared to Him. He is God.

343
00:17:40.715 --> 00:17:42.395
Were not be humble before that.

344
00:17:43.615 --> 00:17:46.315
So then we talked about the doctrine of general revelation.

345
00:17:46.415 --> 00:17:50.765
How people universally the heavens declare

346
00:17:51.315 --> 00:17:54.925
it's audible to the, like, the sun's raised to the end.

347
00:17:55.185 --> 00:17:57.845
And we went into Romans one to defend that.

348
00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:00.965
That's the argument of why it, uh, is true,

349
00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:02.805
of why we believe Romans ones,

350
00:18:02.805 --> 00:18:04.405
or why we, we generally, revelation makes

351
00:18:04.725 --> 00:18:06.325
everyone have no excuse.

352
00:18:06.425 --> 00:18:11.125
Gen Romans one says that, that those

353
00:18:11.185 --> 00:18:12.365
who have received,

354
00:18:12.385 --> 00:18:15.565
or those who will are receiving God's wrath,

355
00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.845
have the truth, but suppress it

356
00:18:19.115 --> 00:18:20.605
through their unrighteousness.

357
00:18:21.745 --> 00:18:23.085
So they are aware.

358
00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:26.285
There's an awareness of the truth,

359
00:18:27.075 --> 00:18:29.085
that God has plainly shown what he can,

360
00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:31.965
what we can know about him for all times.

361
00:18:31.965 --> 00:18:34.485
And what He's made eternal power, divinity,

362
00:18:34.485 --> 00:18:35.645
clearly perceived.

363
00:18:36.225 --> 00:18:37.925
That's why people are without excuse. 'cause.

364
00:18:38.125 --> 00:18:40.285
'cause we know enough to condemn us.

365
00:18:41.065 --> 00:18:45.485
We suppress the truth by our unrighteousness.

366
00:18:45.485 --> 00:18:48.125
They'd own known God, but did not honor him. Thank him.

367
00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:50.085
Their minds were darkened, became futile.

368
00:18:50.595 --> 00:18:51.765
They've not had the gospel.

369
00:18:51.955 --> 00:18:54.205
They're not aware of his, uh, wrath

370
00:18:54.205 --> 00:18:55.325
and righteousness, yet they've

371
00:18:55.525 --> 00:18:56.765
rejected the general revelation.

372
00:18:57.065 --> 00:18:59.845
Now, we'll talk later about how people would push back on

373
00:18:59.845 --> 00:19:01.125
that and say, well, that's not fair.

374
00:19:03.335 --> 00:19:04.595
How, how can that be fair?

375
00:19:05.025 --> 00:19:06.595
Because God didn't even give him a

376
00:19:06.595 --> 00:19:08.235
chance to know the gospel.

377
00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.155
We'll, we'll talk about that a little bit.

378
00:19:10.155 --> 00:19:13.795
That's a question I know people have. But that's general.

379
00:19:13.805 --> 00:19:16.515
We're, we're rejecting creation and what we see about God.

380
00:19:16.515 --> 00:19:17.595
But chapter two shows us,

381
00:19:17.595 --> 00:19:19.275
even in our humanity, we reject God.

382
00:19:19.535 --> 00:19:21.555
His law is in a sense written on our hearts.

383
00:19:21.935 --> 00:19:25.635
So there's a measure of the question people ask about

384
00:19:25.635 --> 00:19:28.515
evolution is why is there morality?

385
00:19:29.465 --> 00:19:31.235
That, that's a hard question to answer.

386
00:19:31.415 --> 00:19:33.075
Why is there morality? There's no sense.

387
00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:34.955
You should be defeating everything else, right?

388
00:19:34.955 --> 00:19:36.435
That's the natural course of that.

389
00:19:37.425 --> 00:19:40.395
It's because God's law is written on our hearts.

390
00:19:41.955 --> 00:19:46.715
Everyone has a general, even really tiny suppressed sense

391
00:19:47.655 --> 00:19:50.075
of God's law written on our hearts.

392
00:19:52.215 --> 00:19:53.955
So we reject that as well.

393
00:19:56.425 --> 00:19:59.765
Now, one of the questions about general revelation is, okay,

394
00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:03.445
those of us who believe in God, we read it back into

395
00:20:04.005 --> 00:20:06.845
creation, that we can't know this stuff about God just

396
00:20:06.845 --> 00:20:09.325
because we look at creation, we are knowing God

397
00:20:09.325 --> 00:20:10.725
and then reading back into it.

398
00:20:11.745 --> 00:20:16.285
No, because it's objectively present.

399
00:20:17.245 --> 00:20:20.285
Erickson, he said, God has given us an objective, valid,

400
00:20:20.645 --> 00:20:22.245
rational revelation of himself in nature.

401
00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:23.845
He also adds history

402
00:20:23.845 --> 00:20:27.085
and human personality that God shows himself.

403
00:20:27.085 --> 00:20:29.405
Even through history. God shows himself even through us,

404
00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:32.805
regardless of whether anyone actually observes it,

405
00:20:32.805 --> 00:20:34.165
understands it, and believes it,

406
00:20:34.355 --> 00:20:37.245
even though it may well have been disturbed by the fall,

407
00:20:37.435 --> 00:20:38.805
it's nonetheless present.

408
00:20:40.345 --> 00:20:41.405
So when we look around,

409
00:20:41.505 --> 00:20:43.205
we know the world is not the way it should be.

410
00:20:44.315 --> 00:20:45.685
Everybody acknowledges that.

411
00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:47.645
You can talk to somebody who had claimed

412
00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:49.525
to be an atheist on a plane.

413
00:20:50.745 --> 00:20:53.605
You can ask 'em, Hey, is everything right in the world?

414
00:20:54.185 --> 00:20:55.205
Is everything the way it should be?

415
00:20:55.385 --> 00:20:56.885
No, they would agree with you.

416
00:20:58.065 --> 00:21:01.405
Now, their reasoning would be different of why education

417
00:21:01.425 --> 00:21:03.005
or government or whatever, right?

418
00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:07.085
Greed. And we would just say, well, yeah, I agree with you.

419
00:21:07.085 --> 00:21:10.725
It's just all called sin. That's why this thing's broken.

420
00:21:12.185 --> 00:21:16.805
But even in that brokenness, there's still evidence

421
00:21:16.805 --> 00:21:18.805
that you can see God in creation.

422
00:21:18.835 --> 00:21:22.805
He's designed it that way so he can be known in some form.

423
00:21:23.355 --> 00:21:24.885
It's like the image of God in us.

424
00:21:27.005 --> 00:21:30.925
Whenever we are image bearers of God, we are tainted by sin.

425
00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:33.045
It's, it's disturbed by sin.

426
00:21:33.345 --> 00:21:36.325
But it doesn't mean we still don't reflect the image

427
00:21:36.325 --> 00:21:37.725
of God in some way.

428
00:21:37.985 --> 00:21:39.005
Not fully, not perfectly.

429
00:21:39.225 --> 00:21:43.045
But you can see how it does actually still show up similar

430
00:21:43.155 --> 00:21:44.365
here in creation.

431
00:21:47.225 --> 00:21:50.285
Now chapter three. So that's Genesis, uh, Romans one,

432
00:21:50.305 --> 00:21:52.085
Romans two, chapter three

433
00:21:53.315 --> 00:21:56.685
then indicates the solution is not just becoming more aware

434
00:21:56.685 --> 00:21:59.565
of God, the solution is the gospel, those spectacles

435
00:21:59.565 --> 00:22:01.085
of faith that Calvin said.

436
00:22:02.705 --> 00:22:04.685
So then we went from general revelation

437
00:22:05.715 --> 00:22:09.725
into special revelation that God showed himself to us

438
00:22:09.725 --> 00:22:11.125
through his word.

439
00:22:12.705 --> 00:22:16.205
And we get into a lot of things about how that developed.

440
00:22:16.205 --> 00:22:17.245
And if you have questions about that,

441
00:22:17.245 --> 00:22:18.845
we can probably talk through that.

442
00:22:18.985 --> 00:22:21.445
But, but it was necessary for that to happen

443
00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:23.845
because we can know enough about God to condemn us,

444
00:22:23.845 --> 00:22:27.965
but we can't know enough about God to save us from creation.

445
00:22:30.595 --> 00:22:32.495
We can't grasp enough from nature

446
00:22:32.635 --> 00:22:34.175
and history to truly know God.

447
00:22:34.175 --> 00:22:38.495
We needed him to uniquely supernaturally speak to us

448
00:22:39.755 --> 00:22:41.055
and tell us about himself.

449
00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:43.175
Tell us how we can be saved through

450
00:22:44.295 --> 00:22:46.335
specific events like Exodus, resurrection

451
00:22:46.335 --> 00:22:48.055
of Christ, prophets.

452
00:22:48.055 --> 00:22:49.255
Apostles spoke his word,

453
00:22:49.275 --> 00:22:51.655
but primarily what we're talking about in special revelation

454
00:22:51.795 --> 00:22:54.895
is what's been in, in scripture related, the,

455
00:22:55.315 --> 00:22:56.935
the recording of God's word.

456
00:22:56.935 --> 00:22:59.855
What we have now as the 66 books called the Bible.

457
00:23:01.635 --> 00:23:05.455
All of this points to who Jesus is, the Savior, the Messiah,

458
00:23:06.265 --> 00:23:07.335
Jesus himself did that.

459
00:23:07.335 --> 00:23:09.735
The road to Emmaus. After he resurrected, he's walking down

460
00:23:09.735 --> 00:23:10.935
with these two disciples

461
00:23:11.195 --> 00:23:12.615
who didn't know it was Jesus at the time.

462
00:23:13.045 --> 00:23:14.175
He'd hidden himself from them.

463
00:23:14.755 --> 00:23:16.455
But he's walking along acting

464
00:23:16.475 --> 00:23:18.335
as if he knows nothing about what's happened.

465
00:23:18.955 --> 00:23:20.095
And he says, what's been going on?

466
00:23:20.095 --> 00:23:21.255
And they tell him, don't you hear?

467
00:23:21.255 --> 00:23:22.295
Didn't you hear about this?

468
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:24.855
Jesus, we thought he was the one and he died.

469
00:23:24.855 --> 00:23:26.495
But it seems that the people say he is resurrected

470
00:23:26.495 --> 00:23:27.615
and Jesus is walking with them.

471
00:23:28.395 --> 00:23:33.375
And what he says as he opens the scriptures

472
00:23:34.395 --> 00:23:37.055
is he shows them how Moses

473
00:23:37.195 --> 00:23:39.855
and the prophets all point to him.

474
00:23:41.335 --> 00:23:44.475
So Jesus himself takes what we know as the Old Testament,

475
00:23:44.475 --> 00:23:45.765
which was their scriptures.

476
00:23:46.105 --> 00:23:49.005
And he says, look, all of this points directly

477
00:23:49.005 --> 00:23:50.325
to me as the Messiah.

478
00:23:50.465 --> 00:23:51.605
And he showed it to him and then

479
00:23:51.605 --> 00:23:52.645
he disappeared and all that.

480
00:23:52.865 --> 00:23:54.645
But that's the, the purpose

481
00:23:54.705 --> 00:23:57.005
of the special revelation is not just

482
00:23:57.005 --> 00:23:59.125
to give us more information about God, it's

483
00:23:59.125 --> 00:24:02.525
to give us the way to salvation through Christ.

484
00:24:05.025 --> 00:24:06.765
Now, how did he do it? Remember how he did it?

485
00:24:06.765 --> 00:24:11.165
He did it through people. He did it through, uh, people

486
00:24:11.225 --> 00:24:15.965
who were, as second Peter one says, spoke from God.

487
00:24:15.965 --> 00:24:17.005
People spoke from God

488
00:24:17.005 --> 00:24:18.285
as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

489
00:24:19.025 --> 00:24:23.645
Uh, even Peter himself saw Paul's words as scripture.

490
00:24:23.715 --> 00:24:27.525
This is second Peter three, as he does in all these letters,

491
00:24:27.525 --> 00:24:29.205
when he speaks in them of these matters,

492
00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:31.205
there's some in them which are hard to understand,

493
00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:34.125
which the ignorant, unstable twist to their own destruction

494
00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:36.045
as they do the other scriptures.

495
00:24:37.345 --> 00:24:40.285
So Peter's looking at Paul's writing in his contemporary

496
00:24:40.475 --> 00:24:44.245
time, and he says, that guy's writing scripture right now,

497
00:24:45.735 --> 00:24:47.885
which I, I love, first of all, just a side note,

498
00:24:47.925 --> 00:24:50.525
I love Peter saying about Paul.

499
00:24:51.395 --> 00:24:53.965
He's like, there are some things in them that are hard

500
00:24:53.965 --> 00:24:55.845
to understand, right?

501
00:24:56.625 --> 00:24:58.125
You ever read Romans?

502
00:24:58.795 --> 00:25:01.685
He's like, whoa, man, that is, that is hard.

503
00:25:01.885 --> 00:25:03.365
I, I have to sit on that for a while.

504
00:25:03.365 --> 00:25:04.805
And Peter's looking at that same thing.

505
00:25:04.805 --> 00:25:06.805
He's like, yeah, I agree with you. That's hard.

506
00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:08.845
So just and be encouraged.

507
00:25:09.225 --> 00:25:10.405
But Peter was looking around at

508
00:25:10.405 --> 00:25:11.565
what God was doing in the moment.

509
00:25:12.225 --> 00:25:14.325
And he saw this as scripture,

510
00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:16.885
but it wasn't, again, a, it wasn't a person

511
00:25:16.905 --> 00:25:18.125
coming up with this stuff.

512
00:25:18.435 --> 00:25:19.845
Paul just was a gifted writer.

513
00:25:21.315 --> 00:25:24.085
What we call it was God speaking through them.

514
00:25:24.175 --> 00:25:25.725
Super intending every word.

515
00:25:25.725 --> 00:25:29.725
What we call that is verbal plenary inspiration, that God

516
00:25:30.245 --> 00:25:33.005
inspired, breathed out his word.

517
00:25:33.835 --> 00:25:37.885
Some people would say that what that means is

518
00:25:37.885 --> 00:25:42.125
that God just basically robotically dictated every word

519
00:25:42.155 --> 00:25:43.165
that we have here.

520
00:25:43.385 --> 00:25:46.845
And, and there was no measure of involvement by the person.

521
00:25:46.845 --> 00:25:48.925
They were just like an empty container.

522
00:25:49.065 --> 00:25:51.125
And God was just making them write these things.

523
00:25:51.585 --> 00:25:53.325
That's not what we actually believe

524
00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:55.485
about the way it happened.

525
00:25:56.775 --> 00:26:00.485
Again, it does mean that God ordained every word

526
00:26:00.485 --> 00:26:02.325
to be there, but he used their context,

527
00:26:02.825 --> 00:26:04.125
he used their personalities.

528
00:26:04.465 --> 00:26:06.165
That's why they're not all the same.

529
00:26:06.165 --> 00:26:07.285
They don't all sound the same

530
00:26:07.285 --> 00:26:09.485
because Peter is different than Paul.

531
00:26:10.265 --> 00:26:11.885
And, and they have different context.

532
00:26:12.235 --> 00:26:13.925
Luke and Matthew read the gospels.

533
00:26:13.925 --> 00:26:15.245
They're all looking at the same thing,

534
00:26:15.545 --> 00:26:17.765
but they're looking at it from all these different angles,

535
00:26:18.585 --> 00:26:20.245
and they're able to explain it

536
00:26:20.585 --> 00:26:22.365
to a certain group of people differently.

537
00:26:22.825 --> 00:26:25.365
And then this person catches it from this guy over here

538
00:26:25.365 --> 00:26:26.365
and they can understand it.

539
00:26:26.555 --> 00:26:29.685
It's all though still inspired

540
00:26:30.915 --> 00:26:34.205
that God was super intending every word,

541
00:26:34.205 --> 00:26:35.565
even the transmission of it.

542
00:26:36.175 --> 00:26:37.885
Which there is books

543
00:26:38.105 --> 00:26:40.845
and books written about how the transmission, uh,

544
00:26:40.905 --> 00:26:42.925
Dan Lee part, we've got this on our website.

545
00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:46.965
Dan Lepar taught two semesters on the development of

546
00:26:47.275 --> 00:26:49.005
what we know as the scriptures.

547
00:26:50.155 --> 00:26:51.845
It's a hugely deep study.

548
00:26:51.955 --> 00:26:55.085
It's awesome to watch how God even kept

549
00:26:55.915 --> 00:26:58.365
what the original, what we call autographs

550
00:26:59.195 --> 00:27:01.325
that Paul was writing down

551
00:27:01.485 --> 00:27:05.125
or his scribe was writing down that original document,

552
00:27:07.275 --> 00:27:10.895
how that has been sustained through even to

553
00:27:10.895 --> 00:27:13.015
what we now have in a wholly different language,

554
00:27:13.845 --> 00:27:17.015
that we can trust what was written even back then.

555
00:27:17.045 --> 00:27:20.415
That God superintendent, every word of that,

556
00:27:20.635 --> 00:27:22.535
we can trust it even today.

557
00:27:25.275 --> 00:27:29.975
So scripture gives us the way of salvation, tells us

558
00:27:29.975 --> 00:27:31.495
who he is, how he he is.

559
00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:34.735
Its purpose is to point us to Christ.

560
00:27:34.735 --> 00:27:36.535
Because Christ then was the

561
00:27:37.855 --> 00:27:39.735
personal revelation of God.

562
00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:44.615
A lot of people will classify those two things together,

563
00:27:45.005 --> 00:27:48.775
that they say the revelation of Christ was a class

564
00:27:49.035 --> 00:27:50.295
of special revelation.

565
00:27:50.485 --> 00:27:52.735
Okay, I can get your, that this guy does.

566
00:27:54.175 --> 00:27:57.735
I would say though, others would say, a,

567
00:27:59.385 --> 00:28:01.445
the revelation of Christ, God,

568
00:28:01.465 --> 00:28:04.645
the Son showing up is at a whole nother level

569
00:28:06.865 --> 00:28:08.725
of God revealing himself.

570
00:28:09.235 --> 00:28:12.045
Then just, we have this God's word.

571
00:28:12.305 --> 00:28:15.045
Yes, cherish it, eat it, hunger for it.

572
00:28:17.145 --> 00:28:20.725
But the fact that God showed up in person,

573
00:28:22.285 --> 00:28:23.605
I think that's a third category.

574
00:28:23.605 --> 00:28:27.965
That's his personal revelation of who he is

575
00:28:28.265 --> 00:28:31.245
and his salvation through faith in Christ.

576
00:28:31.245 --> 00:28:33.925
And that was to save us. And so that's the gospel.

577
00:28:33.925 --> 00:28:36.445
That's why we, we talk a lot about that.

578
00:28:38.065 --> 00:28:41.565
Now, I wanna talk through a, a, a few questions.

579
00:28:41.565 --> 00:28:43.085
Then I'm gonna have Aaron come up here

580
00:28:43.105 --> 00:28:45.445
and he's gonna help talk through this, uh,

581
00:28:45.445 --> 00:28:46.925
with us and do some q and a.

582
00:28:48.835 --> 00:28:50.805
What do we do with this idea of general revelation?

583
00:28:51.595 --> 00:28:55.325
Because okay, we, we can't know enough to be saved by it.

584
00:28:56.555 --> 00:28:59.685
What do we then, what's the benefit of studying

585
00:29:00.755 --> 00:29:03.565
what we might call natural theology or general revelation?

586
00:29:04.915 --> 00:29:08.245
Well, first of all, you should just be stunned.

587
00:29:08.285 --> 00:29:12.045
I should just be stunned by the glory of God in creation.

588
00:29:12.345 --> 00:29:13.765
It should cause us to worship.

589
00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:19.365
Like I, I get to drive down 33rd East in the mornings.

590
00:29:20.025 --> 00:29:23.925
So this sky over here just explodes

591
00:29:25.275 --> 00:29:27.765
some mornings with an incredibly beautiful sunrise.

592
00:29:29.445 --> 00:29:32.685
I mean, fire reds and all kinds of stuff. Beautiful.

593
00:29:33.485 --> 00:29:38.245
I can't help but look at that. Wow, God, you are amazing.

594
00:29:39.185 --> 00:29:40.645
That's the way it should be first.

595
00:29:41.225 --> 00:29:43.685
But then it also, and this, there's a lot more we could say,

596
00:29:43.685 --> 00:29:46.245
but this idea of general revelation gives us a starting

597
00:29:46.245 --> 00:29:47.445
point with unbelievers.

598
00:29:49.065 --> 00:29:51.605
If you launch in with the gospel to some people,

599
00:29:52.075 --> 00:29:53.685
they're gonna write you off like you're a

600
00:29:53.685 --> 00:29:54.725
cult follower and crazy.

601
00:29:56.145 --> 00:30:00.765
But if you can find a way to relate about just creation,

602
00:30:01.715 --> 00:30:04.485
like if we look for those connections with people,

603
00:30:04.675 --> 00:30:09.125
there's actually a way in to the gospel eventually

604
00:30:09.125 --> 00:30:10.245
with somebody about general

605
00:30:10.245 --> 00:30:11.685
revelation starting that conversation.

606
00:30:11.825 --> 00:30:14.165
So look for that. You can find ways, there's plenty

607
00:30:14.165 --> 00:30:15.565
of resources we can point you to about that.

608
00:30:16.505 --> 00:30:20.085
But this idea of general is also the compelling reason.

609
00:30:20.505 --> 00:30:22.725
One of the compelling reasons why we live sent,

610
00:30:22.825 --> 00:30:24.445
why we talk about mission so much.

611
00:30:25.985 --> 00:30:27.685
Why we talk about taking the gospel to people.

612
00:30:27.925 --> 00:30:32.325
'cause the only way to be saved, Romans 10, the only way

613
00:30:32.345 --> 00:30:36.245
to be saved is to believe in God's offer of grace.

614
00:30:37.205 --> 00:30:39.115
Jesus Christ, faith in him.

615
00:30:39.175 --> 00:30:43.555
That's the only way Romans 10 says, how can they believe?

616
00:30:44.725 --> 00:30:47.695
Unless they hear, how can they hear?

617
00:30:47.695 --> 00:30:50.215
Unless someone preaches, how can they preach

618
00:30:50.235 --> 00:30:52.135
unless someone sends them?

619
00:30:53.555 --> 00:30:56.135
So at the end of every service, we say we are sent,

620
00:30:56.555 --> 00:30:59.655
Christ has sent us to do this,

621
00:31:00.795 --> 00:31:03.695
to proclaim the way of salvation in Christ.

622
00:31:05.005 --> 00:31:07.015
Because they can't believe just by looking

623
00:31:07.015 --> 00:31:09.815
around at creation, they can't believe enough to be saved.

624
00:31:10.435 --> 00:31:12.815
As genuine as they want to be about, as, as faithful

625
00:31:12.815 --> 00:31:14.175
as they are to whatever they're doing.

626
00:31:15.035 --> 00:31:16.415
It has to be the gospel.

627
00:31:17.235 --> 00:31:18.775
So that's why we're compelled to go.

628
00:31:19.985 --> 00:31:21.535
God's the one who's gonna sort it out,

629
00:31:21.595 --> 00:31:22.935
who is saved and who's not.

630
00:31:22.935 --> 00:31:25.095
That's not our job. Our job is to take the gospel

631
00:31:25.475 --> 00:31:28.775
to scatter the seed, and then he sorts it out from there.

632
00:31:29.515 --> 00:31:31.375
That's what we have the responsibility to do.

633
00:31:32.005 --> 00:31:33.655
That leads to another question.

634
00:31:35.405 --> 00:31:38.255
What happens to those who don't ever hear the gospel?

635
00:31:40.245 --> 00:31:43.455
It's a common question. It's a good question.

636
00:31:43.855 --> 00:31:46.495
'cause it means you're thinking what happens

637
00:31:46.515 --> 00:31:47.975
to those who've never heard about Jesus?

638
00:31:48.195 --> 00:31:51.335
The common question in our, or the common answer in our day,

639
00:31:52.485 --> 00:31:54.655
because we go back, I said this earlier, we go back

640
00:31:54.655 --> 00:31:56.735
to the fairness of God in our minds.

641
00:31:57.565 --> 00:32:01.695
Well, that's not fair, God, if, if you're gonna condemn them

642
00:32:01.755 --> 00:32:04.705
to hell and they didn't have a chance

643
00:32:04.765 --> 00:32:06.745
to hear, how fair is that?

644
00:32:07.165 --> 00:32:08.625
How good are you? Are you really good?

645
00:32:08.845 --> 00:32:10.905
God, that's, that seems a little too much.

646
00:32:12.405 --> 00:32:16.545
We have to be very careful to sit in judgment over God.

647
00:32:18.605 --> 00:32:20.865
We, we have to be very careful that we don't do that.

648
00:32:21.975 --> 00:32:23.425
Even, even with a good design.

649
00:32:23.425 --> 00:32:26.865
And listen, the the answer that way is a, it's

650
00:32:26.865 --> 00:32:28.745
because we care about those people, right?

651
00:32:28.775 --> 00:32:30.625
It's because we love, we don't want anybody to go to hell.

652
00:32:31.765 --> 00:32:34.105
And so we're like, oh, surely that can't be true.

653
00:32:35.215 --> 00:32:38.665
Well, you just take that little phrase to its logical end,

654
00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:39.725
you're gonna get in a lot of trouble.

655
00:32:40.305 --> 00:32:42.845
Surely that can't be true, right? Oof.

656
00:32:43.265 --> 00:32:44.725
You could say that about a lot of things.

657
00:32:45.145 --> 00:32:47.045
And all of a sudden you're getting down some really,

658
00:32:47.045 --> 00:32:48.445
really dangerous pathways.

659
00:32:49.985 --> 00:32:52.205
So what happens to those who've never heard about Jesus?

660
00:32:52.405 --> 00:32:54.205
I found this article, um, I kind

661
00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:55.725
of read through it a little bit.

662
00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:56.965
I think it's a good summary of

663
00:32:56.965 --> 00:32:58.005
the way we could think about it.

664
00:32:58.005 --> 00:32:59.605
I wanna add some things to it as well.

665
00:32:59.745 --> 00:33:01.045
But we've said this

666
00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:03.205
before, that all, all people are accountable to God.

667
00:33:03.205 --> 00:33:04.485
Whether they're not, they've heard about him.

668
00:33:05.105 --> 00:33:07.405
Romans one, we saw that very clearly.

669
00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:09.725
The problem is we're sinful.

670
00:33:09.725 --> 00:33:11.725
We reject knowledge of God, we rebel against him.

671
00:33:12.905 --> 00:33:15.925
Um, in reality, it's not

672
00:33:15.925 --> 00:33:19.285
that some people have not heard about God, the problem is

673
00:33:19.285 --> 00:33:21.045
that they have rejected what they have heard

674
00:33:21.045 --> 00:33:22.485
and what is readily seen in nature.

675
00:33:23.745 --> 00:33:27.765
So nobody's quote unquote innocent before God.

676
00:33:30.285 --> 00:33:31.505
So Deuteronomy four says,

677
00:33:31.525 --> 00:33:33.705
if from there you seek the Lord your God, you'll find him.

678
00:33:33.705 --> 00:33:34.625
If you look for 'em with all

679
00:33:34.785 --> 00:33:35.665
your heart and with all your soul.

680
00:33:35.935 --> 00:33:37.785
Okay, well, everyone who truly seeks

681
00:33:37.785 --> 00:33:38.985
after God will find him.

682
00:33:39.325 --> 00:33:42.225
If you truly wanna know God, God will make himself known.

683
00:33:42.285 --> 00:33:45.265
The problem though, which, okay, so that leads to, well,

684
00:33:45.265 --> 00:33:48.505
yeah, that guy's generally seeking, fully seeking God.

685
00:33:48.505 --> 00:33:49.665
He just doesn't know who he is. Okay?

686
00:33:51.045 --> 00:33:52.785
Romans three, the problem is

687
00:33:52.785 --> 00:33:54.385
that there's no one who understands.

688
00:33:54.405 --> 00:33:57.585
No one who seeks, God genuinely seeks.

689
00:33:57.725 --> 00:34:00.305
So, so there's the, the parallel between those two things

690
00:34:00.935 --> 00:34:03.185
that, yeah, okay, well, if you seek God, you'll find him.

691
00:34:03.185 --> 00:34:05.785
But nobody seeks God. It's our sinful nature.

692
00:34:06.395 --> 00:34:07.585
We'll get to that in a couple weeks.

693
00:34:08.565 --> 00:34:10.105
We worship a God of our own creation,

694
00:34:10.105 --> 00:34:12.785
even though we can see enough about God in our own hearts.

695
00:34:13.405 --> 00:34:15.825
You know, we, we can't debate the fairness of God

696
00:34:16.375 --> 00:34:18.745
because people are responsible to God for

697
00:34:18.745 --> 00:34:19.945
what he's already revealed to them.

698
00:34:19.975 --> 00:34:22.625
They reject that knowledge, therefore, God is just,

699
00:34:23.405 --> 00:34:26.545
and so we, we then trace,

700
00:34:27.245 --> 00:34:28.345
and this is one thing, I'm, I'm

701
00:34:28.345 --> 00:34:29.585
still trying to work through my head.

702
00:34:29.605 --> 00:34:30.825
I'm still talking it out.

703
00:34:30.885 --> 00:34:33.545
So if, if you have answers to help me,

704
00:34:33.545 --> 00:34:34.985
this would be great later.

705
00:34:35.165 --> 00:34:38.585
But when you think about, uh,

706
00:34:39.185 --> 00:34:42.585
a mythical tribe in the middle of the jungle somewhere,

707
00:34:43.565 --> 00:34:45.225
and you look at them and like they've never heard,

708
00:34:45.225 --> 00:34:47.065
they've never had a chance to hear all of that.

709
00:34:48.565 --> 00:34:50.345
How could God send those people

710
00:34:51.135 --> 00:34:52.265
away from his presence forever?

711
00:34:53.175 --> 00:34:55.505
Well, you think about at some level,

712
00:34:56.645 --> 00:34:58.305
I'm fleshing this out at some level.

713
00:35:00.145 --> 00:35:04.945
Somebody in their family line, 400 generations back,

714
00:35:06.225 --> 00:35:10.495
heard about Yahweh, heard about Jesus,

715
00:35:10.685 --> 00:35:15.435
potentially they rejected that

716
00:35:16.935 --> 00:35:19.115
and then eventually migrated down to this

717
00:35:19.705 --> 00:35:21.395
village in the middle of the jungle.

718
00:35:23.615 --> 00:35:27.275
And when you think about in the Bible,

719
00:35:27.495 --> 00:35:30.755
old Testament especially, you see the curses of the Father

720
00:35:31.775 --> 00:35:33.835
on the generations after.

721
00:35:35.735 --> 00:35:37.035
And then you see the blessings of,

722
00:35:37.045 --> 00:35:39.045
of the Father on the generations after as well.

723
00:35:41.515 --> 00:35:43.805
Each person is culpable, meaning they're guilty

724
00:35:43.805 --> 00:35:44.965
before the Lord on their own.

725
00:35:45.005 --> 00:35:47.445
Nobody's gonna stand before God for me

726
00:35:47.505 --> 00:35:49.205
or for you or for anyone else.

727
00:35:49.665 --> 00:35:51.845
We stand before God on our own guilty,

728
00:35:52.285 --> 00:35:53.445
innocent, all of that.

729
00:35:53.555 --> 00:35:55.205
It's by the grace of God.

730
00:35:55.365 --> 00:35:57.285
We're innocent, but, but we stand by ourselves.

731
00:35:59.545 --> 00:36:02.285
But there is a measure. When you look at Ezekiel.

732
00:36:02.555 --> 00:36:06.005
There's a, a passage talking about the watchman on the wall.

733
00:36:08.325 --> 00:36:10.285
Whenever there's a charge to that watchman

734
00:36:10.285 --> 00:36:11.325
to blow the trumpet,

735
00:36:11.525 --> 00:36:15.245
whenever they see the enemy coming, he has a responsibility

736
00:36:15.305 --> 00:36:18.525
for himself, but also for those people in the city.

737
00:36:19.025 --> 00:36:21.765
So he sees the army coming, he blows the trumpet,

738
00:36:21.905 --> 00:36:24.325
the army comes in, destroys everyone.

739
00:36:25.585 --> 00:36:28.965
The way it says it is that their blood is not on his hands

740
00:36:29.635 --> 00:36:31.125
because he blew the trumpet.

741
00:36:31.305 --> 00:36:33.685
He warned them and they did nothing about it.

742
00:36:35.825 --> 00:36:38.085
But then it says that if he doesn't blow the trumpet,

743
00:36:38.505 --> 00:36:40.165
the enemy comes in, destroys the people,

744
00:36:41.785 --> 00:36:44.015
their blood is on his hands.

745
00:36:46.025 --> 00:36:49.325
Now they all, I mean this, I don't mean to laugh about this,

746
00:36:49.325 --> 00:36:52.965
they all still got destroyed, but,

747
00:36:53.785 --> 00:36:57.805
but his, his culpability in that he's a little bit guilty

748
00:36:58.545 --> 00:37:00.205
on behalf as well.

749
00:37:01.505 --> 00:37:04.965
So there's a measure there of this group

750
00:37:04.965 --> 00:37:07.325
of people doesn't know because somebody back here also

751
00:37:08.425 --> 00:37:10.605
is guilty of not passing it on.

752
00:37:11.445 --> 00:37:14.125
'cause you trace every family line back to Noah's family

753
00:37:14.385 --> 00:37:16.405
before that, back to Adam and Eve, right?

754
00:37:17.825 --> 00:37:19.285
So you can trace it all back

755
00:37:19.285 --> 00:37:21.605
to some level at some place along the way.

756
00:37:21.965 --> 00:37:24.405
Somebody said, Nope, we're done. And they moved on.

757
00:37:25.385 --> 00:37:30.245
And then everybody after them never heard they're guilty.

758
00:37:31.695 --> 00:37:35.835
But God has some, some blood on that guy's hands

759
00:37:35.985 --> 00:37:37.915
that family's hands as well.

760
00:37:38.335 --> 00:37:39.635
Now, I don't know if that's right or not,

761
00:37:39.635 --> 00:37:40.835
but I'm, so I'm trying to think

762
00:37:40.835 --> 00:37:43.355
through some implications of that.

763
00:37:43.655 --> 00:37:46.075
But again, that question, what happens to those never heard?

764
00:37:46.865 --> 00:37:48.275
What should it do for us?

765
00:37:50.415 --> 00:37:54.815
It should compel us to go to live sin.

766
00:37:56.735 --> 00:37:59.635
Now, we're, we don't believe that

767
00:38:01.675 --> 00:38:04.115
somebody would be saved if we tell them,

768
00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:07.555
but they're not saved because we'd never told 'em that

769
00:38:07.555 --> 00:38:09.355
that devalues the sovereignty of God,

770
00:38:09.735 --> 00:38:11.475
his election, all those things.

771
00:38:11.475 --> 00:38:12.595
We'll get to that in a few weeks.

772
00:38:14.175 --> 00:38:17.155
I'm not in control of someone else's salvation, right?

773
00:38:17.155 --> 00:38:18.875
That's not in any way true.

774
00:38:20.135 --> 00:38:24.395
But what it should mean is that we should be compelled to go

775
00:38:24.705 --> 00:38:27.995
because God is worthy of the glory

776
00:38:28.415 --> 00:38:30.715
of everyone hearing about that.

777
00:38:31.775 --> 00:38:34.195
So if we assume, now here, here's the implication.

778
00:38:34.215 --> 00:38:37.685
If we assume that those who've never heard

779
00:38:38.425 --> 00:38:40.085
are granted mercy by God,

780
00:38:41.955 --> 00:38:44.085
then it would be unloving for us

781
00:38:44.185 --> 00:38:46.565
to go tell them about who Jesus is.

782
00:38:48.185 --> 00:38:50.405
We would want to do everything we could to try

783
00:38:50.405 --> 00:38:54.365
to keep the gospel from them so they wouldn't hear,

784
00:38:54.705 --> 00:38:56.405
so then they could die and go to heaven.

785
00:38:57.185 --> 00:38:58.725
You see the implication of that, right?

786
00:38:59.465 --> 00:39:04.285
That's a universalism, that's a, it's completely counter

787
00:39:04.305 --> 00:39:06.005
to the Bible's teaching.

788
00:39:07.185 --> 00:39:08.845
If people are never hearing the gospel,

789
00:39:08.845 --> 00:39:10.125
that means they're automatically saved,

790
00:39:10.125 --> 00:39:13.925
then we should never, never tell anyone

791
00:39:14.825 --> 00:39:16.325
and keep them from hearing about it.

792
00:39:16.985 --> 00:39:19.805
So you can see how that's a logical fallacy

793
00:39:21.185 --> 00:39:23.275
that if they never heard, then God's so,

794
00:39:23.415 --> 00:39:25.235
so the compelling thing here is again,

795
00:39:25.235 --> 00:39:26.355
what does God's word say?

796
00:39:27.695 --> 00:39:28.995
Go make disciples of all nations.

797
00:39:30.105 --> 00:39:31.595
Take the gospel to these people.

798
00:39:31.975 --> 00:39:33.995
If they can't hear, they can't believe.

799
00:39:34.535 --> 00:39:36.595
If they can't believe they're not saved.

800
00:39:37.735 --> 00:39:40.235
So you can follow the logical end of that,

801
00:39:40.295 --> 00:39:43.475
but that means we should be compelled what privilege we have

802
00:39:43.475 --> 00:39:44.875
to be a part of what God's doing

803
00:39:45.415 --> 00:39:47.315
to see people saved around the world.

804
00:39:48.665 --> 00:39:49.955
Okay? Don't push that too far

805
00:39:50.035 --> 00:39:51.075
with the wash one of the wall thing.

806
00:39:51.295 --> 00:39:52.875
But I think it's helped me kind

807
00:39:52.875 --> 00:39:54.595
of understand a little bit there.

808
00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:57.515
Okay, Aaron, come on up here. Let's do some q and a.

809
00:39:57.625 --> 00:40:02.395
I've talked enough. So we'll have, uh,

810
00:40:03.195 --> 00:40:04.835
I think we have some mics around.

811
00:40:04.895 --> 00:40:07.915
Do we, I don't know if we did get those out. Not sure.

812
00:40:08.705 --> 00:40:11.595
Just stand up and talk really loud if you would.

813
00:40:11.655 --> 00:40:13.795
And we can try to answer.

814
00:40:13.895 --> 00:40:17.595
We again, are not, uh, like the word.

815
00:40:18.335 --> 00:40:21.315
We are fallible, we are limited,

816
00:40:21.775 --> 00:40:23.515
but we can try to help answer some questions.

817
00:40:23.515 --> 00:40:24.475
And especially Aaron

818
00:40:24.475 --> 00:40:25.635
can't, 'cause he's a lot smarter than me.

819
00:40:26.135 --> 00:40:27.595
So questions you would have,

820
00:40:27.605 --> 00:40:29.115
let's just go ahead and get started on that.

821
00:40:29.215 --> 00:40:31.875
Uh, raise your hand. Stand up. Go for it. Right over here.

822
00:40:32.245 --> 00:40:34.675
Cheer go. Gary. Yeah,

823
00:40:34.675 --> 00:40:37.555
John, just uh, follow off on the, on the last conversation

824
00:40:37.555 --> 00:40:40.195
because I, in trying

825
00:40:40.195 --> 00:40:42.075
to formulate something in my mind terms,

826
00:40:44.015 --> 00:40:46.835
our granddaughter asked this kind of question of Christmas.

827
00:40:48.135 --> 00:40:49.835
So it's a relevant question for

828
00:40:50.185 --> 00:40:51.185
Yeah. Generations

829
00:40:51.185 --> 00:40:51.795
as well.

830
00:40:52.865 --> 00:40:56.525
Uh, where does, how does Romans two fall into this

831
00:40:57.585 --> 00:41:02.245
and talking about if you have not, if you not have the law

832
00:41:04.665 --> 00:41:07.485
and you do the things of the law,

833
00:41:08.635 --> 00:41:10.365
then you'll be redeemed.

834
00:41:11.745 --> 00:41:13.485
Is that part of the answer as well?

835
00:41:14.515 --> 00:41:16.845
It's, uh, versus 12,

836
00:41:17.085 --> 00:41:20.665
I think on that.

837
00:41:21.085 --> 00:41:23.585
In other words, if you have not, it's like what Paul said,

838
00:41:23.685 --> 00:41:27.225
if the law, the law exposed send

839
00:41:27.225 --> 00:41:31.525
to us without the law, we did not send.

840
00:41:31.615 --> 00:41:33.605
Right? So I'm, I'm just trying

841
00:41:33.605 --> 00:41:36.685
to formulate my own mind too. Same thing,

842
00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:37.705
You're, yeah. So

843
00:41:37.705 --> 00:41:39.565
the question is Romans two 12

844
00:41:39.665 --> 00:41:43.325
and following talks about, for all of sin, for all

845
00:41:43.325 --> 00:41:44.205
who have sinned without the law,

846
00:41:44.205 --> 00:41:45.365
will also perish without the law.

847
00:41:45.625 --> 00:41:47.525
All who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.

848
00:41:47.785 --> 00:41:50.285
For, it's not to hear is the law who are righteous for God.

849
00:41:50.285 --> 00:41:53.645
But the doers of law will be justified for when gentiles

850
00:41:53.645 --> 00:41:56.885
who do not have the law by nature, do what the law requires.

851
00:41:56.885 --> 00:41:58.485
They are a law to themselves,

852
00:41:58.675 --> 00:42:00.885
even though they do not have the law.

853
00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:02.765
They show that the work of the law is written on their

854
00:42:02.765 --> 00:42:05.285
hearts, while their conscience also bears witness.

855
00:42:06.025 --> 00:42:07.405
And their conflicting thoughts accuse

856
00:42:07.405 --> 00:42:09.525
or even excuse them on that day when according to my gospel,

857
00:42:09.665 --> 00:42:12.805
God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.

858
00:42:13.025 --> 00:42:16.045
Now, he never says anything about those gentiles

859
00:42:16.045 --> 00:42:17.285
being saved by that.

860
00:42:17.505 --> 00:42:19.325
He just says that it shows the,

861
00:42:19.505 --> 00:42:23.965
the law is written on our hearts 'cause Yeah.

862
00:42:23.965 --> 00:42:26.805
That let's think that mythical tribe in the middle of jungle

863
00:42:27.575 --> 00:42:29.085
still do good things for one another.

864
00:42:29.115 --> 00:42:31.245
They still care for babies.

865
00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:33.645
They, they, you know, there's evidence of that,

866
00:42:33.675 --> 00:42:36.365
that God has written that law in their hearts. You think?

867
00:42:37.075 --> 00:42:38.125
Yeah, I agree with that.

868
00:42:38.265 --> 00:42:41.165
And Romans two is an extension of Romans one.

869
00:42:41.275 --> 00:42:44.645
Paul is making an argument that people

870
00:42:45.365 --> 00:42:47.525
instinctively know that there is a God

871
00:42:47.835 --> 00:42:50.485
because of creation, the things that he has made.

872
00:42:51.545 --> 00:42:53.085
And they know that there is a God

873
00:42:53.085 --> 00:42:55.085
because of the conscience that he's given them.

874
00:42:55.085 --> 00:42:57.205
They all have, we all have this instinct

875
00:42:57.235 --> 00:43:00.485
that we know there is a God because of what we see.

876
00:43:01.305 --> 00:43:03.445
And we know instinctively right

877
00:43:03.585 --> 00:43:05.205
and wrong, God's law

878
00:43:05.715 --> 00:43:08.645
written on our conscience, our hearts.

879
00:43:09.145 --> 00:43:10.525
And so we have no excuse.

880
00:43:11.965 --> 00:43:15.725
Creation condemns us and conscience condemns us.

881
00:43:16.225 --> 00:43:19.925
So Paul is making a case whether you have the law as a Jew

882
00:43:20.305 --> 00:43:23.445
or you don't have the law as a gentile,

883
00:43:23.865 --> 00:43:27.205
you still have a conscience that condemns you and

884
00:43:27.205 --> 00:43:29.685
therefore he is making a case for Romans three that all

885
00:43:29.685 --> 00:43:31.685
of sin and fallen short of the glory of God.

886
00:43:32.315 --> 00:43:34.205
Yeah. If that makes sense. Good.

887
00:43:36.235 --> 00:43:39.125
Okay. What else? Good question, Gary.

888
00:43:39.305 --> 00:43:41.165
If I could go back to, uh, just

889
00:43:41.165 --> 00:43:45.325
what John was saying earlier, totally agree with, with

890
00:43:45.325 --> 00:43:47.325
what he was saying about someone who's never heard.

891
00:43:48.505 --> 00:43:50.285
We have to be careful there

892
00:43:50.315 --> 00:43:55.245
because God is

893
00:43:55.245 --> 00:43:57.365
not obligated to save anyone.

894
00:43:59.105 --> 00:44:00.925
We, we, we throw that out there

895
00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:03.485
and we think that he's not fair

896
00:44:03.665 --> 00:44:06.085
or he's not just, if he doesn't save anyone,

897
00:44:07.195 --> 00:44:08.965
he's not obligated to save anyone.

898
00:44:09.145 --> 00:44:12.845
To be fair would, would be to let us go

899
00:44:12.865 --> 00:44:14.325
to hell for our sin.

900
00:44:16.585 --> 00:44:20.045
Uh, so we have to remember that we are not condemned

901
00:44:20.875 --> 00:44:24.165
because we haven't heard of Christ or salvation.

902
00:44:24.175 --> 00:44:28.245
We're condemned because we're sinful. Our sin condemns us.

903
00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:30.125
That's why we are ju to be judged.

904
00:44:31.065 --> 00:44:34.245
And if God wants to save somebody in the boonies

905
00:44:34.985 --> 00:44:37.365
in the middle of the woods, he can do that.

906
00:44:37.425 --> 00:44:39.405
The sovereignty of God can reach that person,

907
00:44:40.105 --> 00:44:42.405
but they still instinctively know there is a God

908
00:44:43.205 --> 00:44:44.685
'cause of creation and conscience

909
00:44:44.685 --> 00:44:45.885
and that still condemns them.

910
00:44:46.625 --> 00:44:49.005
Uh, when they suppress the truth. They know.

911
00:44:49.275 --> 00:44:51.365
Paul says, I'm sorry, we had a question. Yeah. Bob,

912
00:44:51.505 --> 00:44:52.505
You good?

913
00:44:52.795 --> 00:44:55.205
Yeah. This is, I guess along the same line,

914
00:44:55.225 --> 00:44:59.205
but a little different also, uh, the question is, uh, people

915
00:44:59.385 --> 00:45:02.835
who have the gospel, they don't understand

916
00:45:03.065 --> 00:45:05.835
that young children are

917
00:45:07.785 --> 00:45:08.795
what happens with them.

918
00:45:10.445 --> 00:45:13.445
I mean yeah, guess everybody's a sinner from birth. Yeah.

919
00:45:13.705 --> 00:45:15.085
So they're too, but,

920
00:45:16.355 --> 00:45:18.935
and you can tell them the gospel that they wouldn't be

921
00:45:18.935 --> 00:45:19.935
Able to put Yeah.

922
00:45:20.845 --> 00:45:22.255
Yeah. That's a great question, Bob.

923
00:45:22.255 --> 00:45:25.255
That's a, that's a natural follow up to that very question

924
00:45:25.425 --> 00:45:28.975
where the question is, okay, what about someone who can't

925
00:45:29.545 --> 00:45:31.815
comprehend the gospel, whether that's

926
00:45:31.815 --> 00:45:33.695
because of, uh, disability

927
00:45:33.875 --> 00:45:37.175
or age, you know, like a, an infant.

928
00:45:37.635 --> 00:45:39.495
Um, we've got a family in our church dealing

929
00:45:39.495 --> 00:45:43.375
with some really heavy, uh, in utero

930
00:45:44.195 --> 00:45:46.895
things with a baby that, that may not make it.

931
00:45:47.435 --> 00:45:51.015
And so the question is, what happens to that baby?

932
00:45:51.395 --> 00:45:52.655
The sinful nature?

933
00:45:55.195 --> 00:45:56.935
God send that 2-year-old

934
00:45:57.615 --> 00:46:00.415
'cause they can't comprehend the, the special needs adult.

935
00:46:00.445 --> 00:46:03.815
Like where do we fall on the mercy of God there?

936
00:46:03.815 --> 00:46:05.575
Do you have initial answer there?

937
00:46:05.885 --> 00:46:07.735
Yeah, I don't, I don't know the answer to that.

938
00:46:07.915 --> 00:46:12.415
Um, again, we're born into sin. We're born condemned.

939
00:46:12.875 --> 00:46:17.705
Uh, we have to trust the sovereignty of God on that one.

940
00:46:17.965 --> 00:46:21.465
And, you know, there's people who hear the gospel

941
00:46:21.525 --> 00:46:24.625
and don't understand it of all ages.

942
00:46:24.725 --> 00:46:28.545
And, and so we have to trust the Lord knows what he's doing.

943
00:46:29.005 --> 00:46:32.545
He has chosen those who, uh,

944
00:46:32.565 --> 00:46:34.065
he wanted to redeem.

945
00:46:34.325 --> 00:46:38.025
And, uh, you know, we do our part in sharing the gospel.

946
00:46:38.165 --> 00:46:41.585
But I, I don't, I i don't claim to know the answer

947
00:46:41.645 --> 00:46:43.025
to, to that one.

948
00:46:43.445 --> 00:46:46.465
That's, that is one of the, that's one

949
00:46:46.465 --> 00:46:48.625
of the questions they ask you in seminary ethics class.

950
00:46:49.375 --> 00:46:53.545
Like that's a fun one. Now, I would say Go ahead. Yeah.

951
00:46:54.255 --> 00:46:55.825
That we got lot of hands went up.

952
00:46:55.975 --> 00:46:59.105
Yeah. I would say just in light of that, this is a

953
00:46:59.895 --> 00:47:03.465
deli delicate because we just said

954
00:47:06.135 --> 00:47:10.515
we can't say, uh, surely God wouldn't do

955
00:47:10.515 --> 00:47:12.755
that in this case over here regarding those

956
00:47:12.755 --> 00:47:13.955
who haven't believed, right?

957
00:47:15.025 --> 00:47:17.115
This one we could say a similar thing, right?

958
00:47:17.145 --> 00:47:19.715
Well, surely God wouldn't do that.

959
00:47:21.175 --> 00:47:22.235
But when you think about

960
00:47:26.245 --> 00:47:28.595
God's mercy and love, that's, that's

961
00:47:28.595 --> 00:47:30.925
where I'm gonna fall on in that situation.

962
00:47:30.925 --> 00:47:32.285
Again, we don't actually know.

963
00:47:32.565 --> 00:47:35.045
Scripture doesn't say there's some debate about age

964
00:47:35.045 --> 00:47:36.765
of accountability in scripture.

965
00:47:38.225 --> 00:47:40.645
That's a, that's a muddy water to walk in.

966
00:47:40.805 --> 00:47:42.485
I think we, we gotta be careful with that.

967
00:47:42.705 --> 00:47:44.325
That's why we preach the gospel to babies.

968
00:47:44.465 --> 00:47:46.725
We preach the gospel to two year olds.

969
00:47:46.725 --> 00:47:50.685
We preach the gospel to everyone, special needs adults.

970
00:47:50.745 --> 00:47:52.245
We, we preach the gospel to everyone.

971
00:47:52.945 --> 00:47:56.285
And here's the thing, we don't know what's going on

972
00:47:56.305 --> 00:47:57.845
inside there either.

973
00:47:59.185 --> 00:48:01.605
That's why we do fall in the mercy and sovereignty of God.

974
00:48:02.365 --> 00:48:06.885
'cause I don't know how that six day old baby,

975
00:48:08.785 --> 00:48:11.045
we, we think they can't comprehend.

976
00:48:11.115 --> 00:48:15.205
They don't understand. Do we really know that?

977
00:48:17.445 --> 00:48:19.745
See, God, this is, this is where the bigness

978
00:48:19.745 --> 00:48:21.265
of God gets into this a little bit more.

979
00:48:22.545 --> 00:48:26.385
I, I want to believe and,

980
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:31.225
and probably could make a case that God would save those

981
00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:35.065
because he has a special heart for orphans, for widows.

982
00:48:35.065 --> 00:48:38.185
There's a, there's a uniqueness in his mind towards certain

983
00:48:38.245 --> 00:48:39.705
groups of people.

984
00:48:39.995 --> 00:48:41.145
Again, he's not loving someone

985
00:48:41.145 --> 00:48:42.345
more than others, but you see what I mean?

986
00:48:42.345 --> 00:48:45.345
Like, he's, he's got an eye towards the refugee,

987
00:48:45.375 --> 00:48:47.425
towards the, the, the outcast, right?

988
00:48:47.455 --> 00:48:48.785
He's got an eye towards certain.

989
00:48:49.085 --> 00:48:53.545
So I think, again, I'm not gonna definitively say,

990
00:48:54.205 --> 00:48:56.585
but, but I do want to rest in that mercy and,

991
00:48:56.605 --> 00:48:57.865
and love of God for that

992
00:48:58.765 --> 00:49:02.865
and trust that he's doing something for that baby, for

993
00:49:02.945 --> 00:49:05.705
that specialized adult, for the gospel when I preach the

994
00:49:05.705 --> 00:49:08.185
gospel to them, that they can hear

995
00:49:08.185 --> 00:49:10.105
and understand if God, if that's God's,

996
00:49:10.125 --> 00:49:11.185
but that's between him and them.

997
00:49:11.185 --> 00:49:13.345
That's his deal. I trust him with that.

998
00:49:13.645 --> 00:49:16.705
My responsibility is to love them

999
00:49:16.705 --> 00:49:17.705
and proclaim the gospel to them.

1000
00:49:18.975 --> 00:49:20.745
Good question though. Those are, those are two

1001
00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:23.745
instant common questions that come from this.

1002
00:49:23.765 --> 00:49:26.545
For sure. Yeah. There was somebody back here had

1003
00:49:26.545 --> 00:49:27.545
Some other hands. Yeah.

1004
00:49:27.545 --> 00:49:29.785
Here you go. I got a mic.

1005
00:49:30.045 --> 00:49:32.825
We got a, we got a mic coming right here. That'll be Mr.

1006
00:49:32.835 --> 00:49:37.305
Steve Murdoch. Its looking very fresh tonight.

1007
00:49:37.355 --> 00:49:40.265
Steve, I wonder, did you something change this week?

1008
00:49:40.765 --> 00:49:43.385
You know, he slept in late, he slept in late today. Oh,

1009
00:49:44.205 --> 00:49:45.785
If I'm Not, he retired, by the way.

1010
00:49:45.785 --> 00:49:48.705
So if I'm, if I'm not mistaken, we have the example

1011
00:49:48.725 --> 00:49:51.305
of David's child when he died.

1012
00:49:51.535 --> 00:49:56.425
Yeah. That David was positive that he would

1013
00:49:57.925 --> 00:49:59.105
see his child again.

1014
00:50:01.005 --> 00:50:02.545
He says, I, he will not come to me.

1015
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:05.385
I will go to him, I I'll correct to be with him,

1016
00:50:05.405 --> 00:50:06.465
is kind of how he phrases that.

1017
00:50:06.465 --> 00:50:09.745
Correct. Yeah. That, that's commonly used.

1018
00:50:09.765 --> 00:50:11.065
And I don't want to disagree.

1019
00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:16.025
Some people would say that's Sheol the place of the dead,

1020
00:50:16.255 --> 00:50:18.505
meaning he's not gonna come back to life,

1021
00:50:18.565 --> 00:50:20.665
but eventually I'm gonna die like he did.

1022
00:50:20.845 --> 00:50:25.065
That's so that's part of why we'd say, well,

1023
00:50:25.085 --> 00:50:28.285
it sounds like David believes he's gonna be with Yahweh.

1024
00:50:29.195 --> 00:50:31.645
Correct. But we can't definitively say a hundred

1025
00:50:31.645 --> 00:50:32.765
percent that that's what he meant.

1026
00:50:32.765 --> 00:50:35.445
Because there can be some debate about the just death in

1027
00:50:35.445 --> 00:50:36.885
general that he wasn't gonna come back

1028
00:50:36.885 --> 00:50:37.925
to life even though he was praying.

1029
00:50:37.925 --> 00:50:39.405
Right? Correct. He was praying for him to come back

1030
00:50:39.405 --> 00:50:40.845
to life and he wasn't.

1031
00:50:40.845 --> 00:50:41.885
Correct. He didn't.

1032
00:50:42.025 --> 00:50:44.605
So I'm gonna go eventually die like he did.

1033
00:50:44.605 --> 00:50:46.165
He won't come back to life like me.

1034
00:50:46.505 --> 00:50:49.725
So, but it's a great point, yes. That's often used.

1035
00:50:50.675 --> 00:50:52.045
Yeah. And again, we have to be careful.

1036
00:50:52.145 --> 00:50:56.565
We can't assume anything with the Lord, uh,

1037
00:50:57.425 --> 00:51:01.365
or impose that he has to save these babies.

1038
00:51:02.875 --> 00:51:04.645
Otherwise, you step into

1039
00:51:05.075 --> 00:51:07.485
what John was talking about a minute ago with universalism,

1040
00:51:07.625 --> 00:51:11.685
you, why not just, and this is gonna sound terrible,

1041
00:51:11.745 --> 00:51:13.405
but why not just kill all of our babies

1042
00:51:13.585 --> 00:51:14.685
and then they'll go to heaven?

1043
00:51:15.665 --> 00:51:20.165
Uh, that, that's a dangerous theology to get into.

1044
00:51:21.025 --> 00:51:23.045
Uh, so yeah, we just don't know.

1045
00:51:23.185 --> 00:51:25.405
We have to trust the sovereignty of God on those

1046
00:51:25.465 --> 00:51:28.645
who pass away in infancy.

1047
00:51:29.025 --> 00:51:30.725
We just don't know. We just don't know.

1048
00:51:32.405 --> 00:51:37.165
Back here. This would go along with, uh,

1049
00:51:37.235 --> 00:51:38.965
like the tribes who have never heard

1050
00:51:39.625 --> 00:51:41.365
the gospel had that opportunity.

1051
00:51:41.985 --> 00:51:45.045
In Romans chapter nine where it talks about,

1052
00:51:45.115 --> 00:51:49.205
it's talking about the, the sovereignty of God in verses

1053
00:51:49.205 --> 00:51:52.405
around 2324, it refers

1054
00:51:52.405 --> 00:51:55.005
to the potter has control over the clay,

1055
00:51:55.665 --> 00:52:00.245
and it refers to, uh, the vessels who are prepared

1056
00:52:00.305 --> 00:52:04.245
for destruct destruction versus the vessels who were,

1057
00:52:04.585 --> 00:52:05.805
uh, prepared for grace.

1058
00:52:06.235 --> 00:52:09.245
Some translations say destined

1059
00:52:09.505 --> 00:52:11.605
for destruction rather than prepared for.

1060
00:52:11.985 --> 00:52:13.525
So I don't know if this would be a passage

1061
00:52:13.555 --> 00:52:18.285
that would play into that, uh, particular discussion or not.

1062
00:52:18.675 --> 00:52:22.085
Yeah, you're gonna get into

1063
00:52:22.085 --> 00:52:23.125
that in a few weeks, aren't you?

1064
00:52:23.475 --> 00:52:26.285
That or is that me? Salvation?

1065
00:52:26.705 --> 00:52:28.565
I'm salvation. You're Salvation. Yeah. Okay.

1066
00:52:30.915 --> 00:52:34.285
Yeah, that's a good point. Uh, Gil, there are,

1067
00:52:36.655 --> 00:52:38.245
again, we're, we're not condemned

1068
00:52:38.245 --> 00:52:40.165
because we don't hear of Christ.

1069
00:52:40.295 --> 00:52:42.045
We're condemned because of our sin.

1070
00:52:42.055 --> 00:52:44.485
We're sin, we're, we're born into sin.

1071
00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:49.045
We're sinful from birth, conceived in sin, David says.

1072
00:52:49.705 --> 00:52:54.125
And so there are some that are destined for destruction,

1073
00:52:54.585 --> 00:52:56.485
uh, just as Romans nine says.

1074
00:52:57.875 --> 00:52:58.165
Yeah,

1075
00:53:03.095 --> 00:53:03.805
heavy topics.

1076
00:53:05.345 --> 00:53:08.245
And, and I, I think, feel free to ask another question,

1077
00:53:08.305 --> 00:53:11.965
but that conversation, what he just said,

1078
00:53:12.585 --> 00:53:17.445
can get really, really cold, fast and harsh.

1079
00:53:19.585 --> 00:53:23.165
And, and it's true to say God's,

1080
00:53:23.975 --> 00:53:26.165
God's sovereign over salvation.

1081
00:53:27.025 --> 00:53:28.445
Not everyone's going to be saved,

1082
00:53:28.825 --> 00:53:32.725
and God has planned all of everything.

1083
00:53:32.745 --> 00:53:34.925
And so we, we have to define that,

1084
00:53:36.785 --> 00:53:39.365
but we shouldn't be like flippant about that

1085
00:53:39.545 --> 00:53:41.685
and rejoice in any way about that.

1086
00:53:43.155 --> 00:53:44.445
Because like Aaron said

1087
00:53:44.445 --> 00:53:49.165
before, really none of us deserve to be saved.

1088
00:53:50.755 --> 00:53:55.085
Like It's by grace at all that he saves anybody.

1089
00:53:56.705 --> 00:53:58.645
And so if we know the gospel

1090
00:53:58.825 --> 00:54:03.685
and we have seen God in his word, in salvation,

1091
00:54:05.045 --> 00:54:07.465
his Holy Spirit planted inside of us as the down payment

1092
00:54:07.525 --> 00:54:11.465
for eternity, man, we should just be dumbfounded

1093
00:54:12.665 --> 00:54:16.485
and stunned, first of all,

1094
00:54:16.485 --> 00:54:18.645
that you were born in a time

1095
00:54:19.585 --> 00:54:23.925
and often a place that you could hear and believe

1096
00:54:24.705 --> 00:54:27.645
and a free place that you could worship and respond.

1097
00:54:29.955 --> 00:54:32.645
None of us chose that. Right?

1098
00:54:34.105 --> 00:54:35.165
So be stunned

1099
00:54:36.065 --> 00:54:40.285
and be broken 'cause of sin.

1100
00:54:41.715 --> 00:54:45.335
Sin is the reason wrath exists.

1101
00:54:46.875 --> 00:54:49.775
So be struck by that hate sin

1102
00:54:51.035 --> 00:54:52.575
and worship Christ

1103
00:54:52.575 --> 00:54:54.695
because of his grace to you if you believe.

1104
00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:59.735
Yeah. What else?

1105
00:55:01.155 --> 00:55:01.935
Got a few more minutes.

1106
00:55:08.525 --> 00:55:09.735
Elizabeth's got one right here.

1107
00:55:14.855 --> 00:55:16.975
S So it almost feels like,

1108
00:55:20.455 --> 00:55:23.465
it's almost like we have to wrestle with a little bit

1109
00:55:23.465 --> 00:55:24.665
of survivor's guilt.

1110
00:55:25.225 --> 00:55:28.745
Hmm. You know,

1111
00:55:28.745 --> 00:55:30.665
like when great tragedies happen

1112
00:55:31.005 --> 00:55:34.505
and people walk away from the building that collapse

1113
00:55:34.565 --> 00:55:38.545
and they don't understand why them Yeah.

1114
00:55:38.845 --> 00:55:42.545
And not others. That's kind

1115
00:55:42.545 --> 00:55:43.865
of, I don't know.

1116
00:55:43.865 --> 00:55:46.865
Is that the right it, I it shouldn't feel guilty,

1117
00:55:47.125 --> 00:55:48.145
but it feels guilty.

1118
00:55:48.925 --> 00:55:50.025
That's a good question.

1119
00:55:50.525 --> 00:55:53.945
And yeah, I would, I would be careful using the word guilt,

1120
00:55:54.165 --> 00:55:56.745
but I get the point and it feels like that at times.

1121
00:55:56.965 --> 00:56:00.425
So I think we,

1122
00:56:01.765 --> 00:56:05.225
we should let that feeling again, first

1123
00:56:05.735 --> 00:56:07.025
spur us towards worship.

1124
00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:11.585
Uh, Like gratitude. Yeah.

1125
00:56:11.615 --> 00:56:15.185
Just this sense of wonder

1126
00:56:17.815 --> 00:56:19.265
that God would do this.

1127
00:56:21.245 --> 00:56:25.445
He would come to us, tell us about himself, save us.

1128
00:56:25.555 --> 00:56:28.525
Like what? So yes,

1129
00:56:28.525 --> 00:56:30.845
there should be this wonder and gratitude.

1130
00:56:30.945 --> 00:56:35.765
And, and that's what, just as a side note, when we do

1131
00:56:35.765 --> 00:56:40.085
what we do on Sundays up here, when you read your Bible

1132
00:56:40.545 --> 00:56:44.725
and you're in personal worship with the Lord, you know,

1133
00:56:45.105 --> 00:56:48.485
we are not just trying to create emotional experiences.

1134
00:56:49.115 --> 00:56:51.245
It's not the goal we're trying

1135
00:56:51.245 --> 00:56:52.325
to put on a great performance.

1136
00:56:52.325 --> 00:56:53.325
Everybody get into it

1137
00:56:53.325 --> 00:56:54.725
and shoot t-shirt cannons

1138
00:56:54.725 --> 00:56:55.805
around, make everybody excited, right?

1139
00:56:55.805 --> 00:57:00.325
Like, that's not what the goal is to say,

1140
00:57:00.395 --> 00:57:01.965
look at how great our God is.

1141
00:57:02.635 --> 00:57:05.045
Look at how gracious he is. Look at how loving he is.

1142
00:57:05.045 --> 00:57:07.285
Look at what he's done. And we've seen it.

1143
00:57:08.735 --> 00:57:10.365
We've witnessed it. We sing that song, right?

1144
00:57:10.375 --> 00:57:13.285
We've witnessed it and he's done these amazing things

1145
00:57:13.345 --> 00:57:14.685
and we should just be stunned.

1146
00:57:17.065 --> 00:57:20.005
But I think I can feel now,

1147
00:57:20.015 --> 00:57:23.045
maybe more than I ever have when you ask that question, what

1148
00:57:23.045 --> 00:57:26.805
that feels like to hurt that some don't know.

1149
00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:29.405
Many don't know that.

1150
00:57:32.465 --> 00:57:36.885
And, and I, I think it should, should break us a little bit

1151
00:57:37.785 --> 00:57:40.125
not to accuse God.

1152
00:57:40.125 --> 00:57:42.325
Because there's all kinds of scriptures that say, here,

1153
00:57:42.385 --> 00:57:43.405
God, you're not fair.

1154
00:57:43.665 --> 00:57:46.965
How could you do this? We don't ever want to accuse God,

1155
00:57:47.585 --> 00:57:50.655
sit in judgment over God, But

1156
00:57:51.315 --> 00:57:52.655
it should just break us.

1157
00:57:53.925 --> 00:57:58.775
Like for our neighbors, for the lost tribe in the middle

1158
00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:00.095
of nowhere, for the

1159
00:58:01.815 --> 00:58:04.215
prominent atheist who's out there trying

1160
00:58:04.215 --> 00:58:08.735
to defeat Christianity for the, the good guy down the street

1161
00:58:10.115 --> 00:58:12.415
who doesn't love Jesus, but he loves everybody else.

1162
00:58:12.565 --> 00:58:14.735
Like it should break us for that

1163
00:58:16.035 --> 00:58:20.495
and compel us towards, I don't know who's gonna be,

1164
00:58:20.575 --> 00:58:22.015
I don't know who God has ordained

1165
00:58:22.015 --> 00:58:26.335
and not, I, I don't know that my job,

1166
00:58:27.195 --> 00:58:29.215
my job is to care and love

1167
00:58:29.435 --> 00:58:31.655
and sacrifice like Jesus did for me,

1168
00:58:31.715 --> 00:58:32.935
for everyone else around me.

1169
00:58:33.355 --> 00:58:35.735
And to proclaim this truth, the gospel,

1170
00:58:35.735 --> 00:58:38.655
because I know when he says scatter the seed,

1171
00:58:38.655 --> 00:58:40.095
there's gonna be good soil out there.

1172
00:58:40.775 --> 00:58:42.575
Somebody's gonna believe. And the grief

1173
00:58:42.645 --> 00:58:45.095
that we will feel the rest of our days

1174
00:58:45.095 --> 00:58:46.135
until Jesus comes back is

1175
00:58:46.135 --> 00:58:47.655
that some people will turn away from that,

1176
00:58:49.395 --> 00:58:51.455
or some people won't ever hear that,

1177
00:58:54.475 --> 00:58:56.215
And we should feel that you're right.

1178
00:58:57.435 --> 00:59:00.535
But there's coming a day then where I, I think part

1179
00:59:00.535 --> 00:59:02.855
of the fear, this is, um, I'll let you talk.

1180
00:59:03.495 --> 00:59:07.055
I talk a lot, but, um, we, part of the fear,

1181
00:59:07.155 --> 00:59:08.895
and I think we've gotten this image in our head

1182
00:59:08.895 --> 00:59:10.735
that we're gonna look, we're gonna be in heaven

1183
00:59:11.515 --> 00:59:12.935
and somehow looking down

1184
00:59:13.635 --> 00:59:17.095
and watching people suffer who we know

1185
00:59:17.115 --> 00:59:20.575
and love in life and, and we're gonna see it happen.

1186
00:59:21.965 --> 00:59:23.685
I just don't think that's gonna be that way

1187
00:59:24.015 --> 00:59:27.325
where we're gonna have this measure of grief in heaven

1188
00:59:27.355 --> 00:59:28.565
because of all this,

1189
00:59:28.915 --> 00:59:30.605
because of what we're talking about right now.

1190
00:59:30.805 --> 00:59:31.805
I just don't think that's true

1191
00:59:31.805 --> 00:59:33.165
because there's no tears in heaven.

1192
00:59:33.275 --> 00:59:35.685
There's no grief. All that's been washed away.

1193
00:59:38.945 --> 00:59:41.605
That's a tough one for people to wrap their minds around.

1194
00:59:41.665 --> 00:59:43.405
Is, is how God could do that.

1195
00:59:44.825 --> 00:59:46.165
But his ways are higher than our ways.

1196
00:59:46.225 --> 00:59:47.525
His thoughts are higher than our thoughts.

1197
00:59:48.305 --> 00:59:49.365
And, and the beauty

1198
00:59:49.365 --> 00:59:51.085
of it is we should wrestle with this stuff.

1199
00:59:53.465 --> 00:59:54.485
If, if we're sitting here,

1200
00:59:54.485 --> 00:59:55.765
this is the whole reason we're doing this series.

1201
00:59:55.865 --> 01:00:00.125
If we're sitting here and we're talking about these things

1202
01:00:00.905 --> 01:00:03.925
and we're just kinda like, yeah, whatever God's good,

1203
01:00:03.925 --> 01:00:06.685
we're gonna do it and we're not wrestling with this kind

1204
01:00:06.685 --> 01:00:10.765
of stuff, then you're gonna get an a question asked

1205
01:00:10.765 --> 01:00:12.445
of you at some point in your life

1206
01:00:12.505 --> 01:00:15.885
or a situation gonna come up in your life at some point.

1207
01:00:16.225 --> 01:00:18.765
And all this is gonna finally collapse on you

1208
01:00:18.825 --> 01:00:20.725
and you've never wrestled with it before.

1209
01:00:21.905 --> 01:00:23.725
That's gonna be problematic in that moment.

1210
01:00:25.825 --> 01:00:27.445
So we need to be wrestling with these things.

1211
01:00:27.595 --> 01:00:29.005
It's a great question to ask.

1212
01:00:29.715 --> 01:00:34.205
It's a great heart processing to do, to consider where,

1213
01:00:35.105 --> 01:00:36.605
man, where do I land on this?

1214
01:00:36.625 --> 01:00:38.165
How does, how does God's words and

1215
01:00:38.165 --> 01:00:41.325
and really let it force you back into his word

1216
01:00:41.825 --> 01:00:44.765
to cherish it, to study it, to glean what you can

1217
01:00:44.865 --> 01:00:46.365
and eat his word.

1218
01:00:47.345 --> 01:00:50.085
Uh, because we should be wrestling with these things and,

1219
01:00:50.665 --> 01:00:53.605
and we shouldn't be afraid of having hard conversations

1220
01:00:53.665 --> 01:00:57.925
and talking about hard things and hear this last thing.

1221
01:00:58.585 --> 01:01:01.165
Um, God's a big boy.

1222
01:01:01.165 --> 01:01:03.765
He can handle it when we bring this stuff to him

1223
01:01:03.765 --> 01:01:06.285
and say, God, I don't get this one.

1224
01:01:08.025 --> 01:01:10.245
God I don't know this. Oh boy, this is hard.

1225
01:01:10.245 --> 01:01:14.845
This was hard to get. I don't know God. He can handle that.

1226
01:01:15.825 --> 01:01:17.285
He can handle our doubts or questions,

1227
01:01:18.465 --> 01:01:20.325
and he wants you to come to him in those things.

1228
01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:22.405
So don't hide that.

1229
01:01:22.455 --> 01:01:24.685
Don't run away from that half the questions

1230
01:01:24.685 --> 01:01:26.245
with people asked through that talk.

1231
01:01:26.835 --> 01:01:27.885
Read these kind of books.

1232
01:01:28.005 --> 01:01:29.485
I mean, there's people who've thought about this for

1233
01:01:30.535 --> 01:01:31.845
40 years of their life

1234
01:01:31.845 --> 01:01:33.965
and they've tried to write how they can formulate that.

1235
01:01:35.065 --> 01:01:37.165
But in the end, there's gonna be things we just don't

1236
01:01:37.165 --> 01:01:38.965
understand about who God is.

1237
01:01:38.965 --> 01:01:40.925
And that's good because he's God and we're not.

1238
01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:44.045
But don't run away from the questions either.

1239
01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:45.265
So you got anything else?

1240
01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:50.325
I love your analogy of surviving a, a burning building

1241
01:01:52.545 --> 01:01:53.645
and not knowing why.

1242
01:01:54.465 --> 01:01:59.365
Um, all I can say is we, we

1243
01:02:00.975 --> 01:02:02.285
trust the Lord with all our heart

1244
01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:05.085
and lean not on our own understanding.

1245
01:02:05.185 --> 01:02:07.765
We have to trust the sovereignty of God.

1246
01:02:07.945 --> 01:02:11.245
He has his purposes for those who died

1247
01:02:11.305 --> 01:02:12.485
and for those who live.

1248
01:02:13.265 --> 01:02:16.365
And I just have to say, thank you, Lord, be grateful.

1249
01:02:17.345 --> 01:02:19.685
Figure out why I'm still alive.

1250
01:02:19.865 --> 01:02:21.765
What's my pur what's his purpose for me?

1251
01:02:22.945 --> 01:02:25.205
And, uh, maybe there's somebody I'm supposed to be sharing

1252
01:02:25.205 --> 01:02:28.525
with, but, um, that's a tough one.

1253
01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:30.845
You just have, we just have to trust the Lord has his

1254
01:02:30.845 --> 01:02:34.845
purposes and be grateful that we are one of his.

1255
01:02:36.825 --> 01:02:38.645
So that's a great, great analogy.

1256
01:02:40.385 --> 01:02:43.165
So we have, uh, worship leader

1257
01:02:43.715 --> 01:02:46.045
development happening in here in about 12 minutes.

1258
01:02:46.905 --> 01:02:49.045
And so we'll be around,

1259
01:02:49.315 --> 01:02:51.085
there's a few other elders here as well.

1260
01:02:51.705 --> 01:02:54.685
Um, if you have any other questions, look at these books,

1261
01:02:54.685 --> 01:02:56.165
those kind of things, whatever you wanna do.

1262
01:02:56.745 --> 01:03:00.285
Um, but within the next 12 minutes, like you don't have

1263
01:03:00.285 --> 01:03:01.965
to go home, but you can't stay here kind of thing, right?

1264
01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.805
So just go out to the lobby if you want to continue

1265
01:03:04.805 --> 01:03:08.325
to have conversations, they're, they're not gonna run off,

1266
01:03:08.325 --> 01:03:09.845
they're not gonna, they're not gonna kick you out

1267
01:03:09.845 --> 01:03:11.925
or anything, but just, you know, that's,

1268
01:03:11.925 --> 01:03:13.845
that's what's happening next in here, just so you know.

1269
01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:17.285
But, but I honestly did not know

1270
01:03:18.595 --> 01:03:19.925
this whole how this was gonna go.

1271
01:03:20.385 --> 01:03:21.805
Now lemme just be clear.

1272
01:03:21.805 --> 01:03:23.445
There's gonna be some weeks, this'll be a lot.

1273
01:03:26.205 --> 01:03:27.565
I thought this week was gonna be

1274
01:03:27.565 --> 01:03:28.645
the easiest of all the weeks.

1275
01:03:29.635 --> 01:03:31.885
Okay. We started pretty good tonight, didn't we?

1276
01:03:31.955 --> 01:03:36.245
Like, okay, so, um, the next,

1277
01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:38.485
these will be hard as we go into it.

1278
01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:41.285
Attributes of God, the Trinity, God, the Son,

1279
01:03:41.825 --> 01:03:43.405
and lemme just again remind you,

1280
01:03:44.345 --> 01:03:46.605
we don't know everything about this.

1281
01:03:47.465 --> 01:03:49.205
We are fall and fallible.

1282
01:03:49.495 --> 01:03:52.085
We're trying to process, we're learning along with you.

1283
01:03:52.985 --> 01:03:57.605
Um, so let's show grace to each other in this Let's learn

1284
01:03:57.605 --> 01:03:58.765
how to disagree at times.

1285
01:03:58.895 --> 01:04:00.205
Let's walk through some things. But,

1286
01:04:00.585 --> 01:04:02.285
but our hope is to point you to who I,

1287
01:04:02.285 --> 01:04:03.845
who God is over the next few weeks

1288
01:04:03.845 --> 01:04:05.125
especially, and just grow in that.

1289
01:04:05.215 --> 01:04:06.845
Learn who he is. Uh,

1290
01:04:06.945 --> 01:04:09.165
but there'll be times I would guess we'll be up here

1291
01:04:09.165 --> 01:04:10.725
and be like, I don't know.

1292
01:04:11.945 --> 01:04:13.445
And it's okay to answer. I don't know.

1293
01:04:13.795 --> 01:04:16.005
It's, it's a measure of humility in that we should, right?

1294
01:04:16.005 --> 01:04:17.845
If we don't know the answer, don't try to act like you do.

1295
01:04:18.265 --> 01:04:20.925
So let's say, all right, I'll help.

1296
01:04:21.075 --> 01:04:22.925
I'll look for the answer, I'll help find that for you.

1297
01:04:22.935 --> 01:04:24.205
Let's talk later. That kind of stuff.

1298
01:04:24.905 --> 01:04:28.285
Uh, but that's the exciting thing for me

1299
01:04:28.285 --> 01:04:30.085
after tonight, is to see how this is gonna go.

1300
01:04:30.945 --> 01:04:34.965
And, and we're gonna work hard to, to be ready and prepared

1301
01:04:35.025 --> 01:04:37.245
and as best we can, but also just realize

1302
01:04:37.245 --> 01:04:39.245
that we're not gonna know it all.

1303
01:04:39.425 --> 01:04:42.125
And that's a good thing. 'cause God is bigger than us.

1304
01:04:42.705 --> 01:04:44.405
So God, thank you so much for tonight.

1305
01:04:44.405 --> 01:04:45.525
Thank you for these men

1306
01:04:45.525 --> 01:04:47.805
and women who wanna dig a little deeper

1307
01:04:48.265 --> 01:04:50.125
and, uh, have these hard conversations.

1308
01:04:50.155 --> 01:04:54.885
Kind of think through the implications of these truths.

1309
01:04:54.995 --> 01:04:58.085
Like just that you've revealed yourself in creation to us,

1310
01:04:58.085 --> 01:04:59.645
in your word through Christ.

1311
01:05:00.905 --> 01:05:03.205
Um, God, there's a lot of questions

1312
01:05:03.205 --> 01:05:04.485
that we don't know the answer to.

1313
01:05:05.225 --> 01:05:10.085
And so in that we come to you,

1314
01:05:10.305 --> 01:05:12.965
we need you Holy Spirit, we need your wisdom

1315
01:05:14.715 --> 01:05:18.405
that you would meet us in our time of need,

1316
01:05:18.425 --> 01:05:20.085
in our lack.

1317
01:05:21.265 --> 01:05:25.805
He would show up and you would teach us Jesus.

1318
01:05:25.945 --> 01:05:28.005
You said the Holy Spirit's gonna illuminate.

1319
01:05:28.745 --> 01:05:30.045
So we prayed that that would be true.

1320
01:05:30.105 --> 01:05:32.285
As we study your words, we hunger for it, thirst for it.

1321
01:05:34.525 --> 01:05:38.725
I prayed that you would, you would give each one of these

1322
01:05:40.925 --> 01:05:45.565
a, a measure of humility

1323
01:05:45.665 --> 01:05:48.605
before you give me a measure of humility

1324
01:05:48.605 --> 01:05:51.645
before you, that you are God of the universe,

1325
01:05:52.785 --> 01:05:57.325
but also this measure of confidence that you are imminent,

1326
01:05:57.385 --> 01:06:00.325
you are near, you're with us.

1327
01:06:02.985 --> 01:06:05.725
And Lord, if, if you are for us, who can be against us,

1328
01:06:10.885 --> 01:06:13.495
your ways are so much higher, God, we will see

1329
01:06:13.735 --> 01:06:15.895
that many times over the next few weeks.

1330
01:06:17.365 --> 01:06:18.495
There's so much about you.

1331
01:06:18.555 --> 01:06:20.615
We will never understand anything we try to do

1332
01:06:20.635 --> 01:06:23.415
to explain you only reduces you in some way.

1333
01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.575
But Lord, we pray that in, in our weakness,

1334
01:06:28.755 --> 01:06:32.955
you would show yourself strong in our

1335
01:06:33.985 --> 01:06:34.995
lack of understanding.

1336
01:06:35.095 --> 01:06:38.795
You would show yourself wise in our lack of ability

1337
01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:40.355
to answer questions people would ask.

1338
01:06:41.185 --> 01:06:44.075
Show yourself to be the answer to people.

1339
01:06:47.185 --> 01:06:50.675
Give us faith, faith when we don't all always understand

1340
01:06:50.845 --> 01:06:54.595
everything we have faith in you.

1341
01:06:55.175 --> 01:06:57.675
So, Lord, thank you. Thank you for the great questions,

1342
01:06:57.735 --> 01:07:01.075
the good thinking and deep thoughts tonight.

1343
01:07:01.215 --> 01:07:03.715
And I trust you'll lead us as we go.

1344
01:07:04.175 --> 01:07:08.235
Uh, give us strength and prepare us for Sunday as well

1345
01:07:08.235 --> 01:07:12.315
as we take on the next topic about your attributes, what

1346
01:07:12.315 --> 01:07:15.115
that means, who you are that you've revealed to us.

1347
01:07:15.205 --> 01:07:15.915
Thank you, God.

1348
01:07:20.465 --> 01:07:24.195
Give yourself even more glory as we know you better

1349
01:07:25.235 --> 01:07:26.615
in Jesus authority we pray.

1350
01:07:27.445 --> 01:07:32.175
Amen. Amen. Love you church. Thank you. We are sent.
