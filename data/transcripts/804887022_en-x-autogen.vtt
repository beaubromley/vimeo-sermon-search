00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.200
For the grace of God offers salvation

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.800
to all people teaching us

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.200
to live Godly life.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.500
Jesus gave himself for us to redeem us and to

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
purify for himself a people that

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.600
are his very own.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, happy Sunday to you Faith Family. It is

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.100
a joy to worship together with you every Sunday our

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.300
King and Savior Jesus Christ. He's worthy of

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.900
it all whether it's whether it's quiet and smaller

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.600
and simple last week or big

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.500
and joyful and and overwhelming in

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
some sense this week. We see that he is worthy and

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.500
he is being worshiped.

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.900
I'm a little sad today though, because as you can tell we've come

16
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.300
to the end of our journey through the book of

17
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.100
Titus.

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.300
This new testament letter from Paul to Titus and I've

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.000
come to love it. I hope you have too and the God's worked in it

20
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.100
and through it in your life.

21
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.700
Maybe you're new here. And you don't know anything about Titus. That's okay because we

22
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
are going to walk through a brief summary to catch

23
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.100
us up on those things. But first of all, I'm thankful that you

24
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
are here with us. If if you are new we haven't met you

25
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.300
yet. Please introduce yourself to us if you can or there's a QR code

26
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.400
in the seat back. We're not gonna spam you but we do want to help you

27
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.300
walk towards Jesus. That's the goal in everything we

28
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.100
do here.

29
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.600
But this letter to Titus remember that the melodic line

30
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.500
that we have seen that the tune

31
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.300
it has consistently played throughout the whole

32
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.400
book. Is this idea that that both the church as

33
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.000
well as individual Believers are gods.

34
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.700
And the way we've said that is that we are his very own.

35
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.700
The church is and we are his very own as

36
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.500
Titus 214 says clearly that Jesus gave

37
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.800
himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and

38
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.500
to purify for himself a people for

39
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.900
his own possession.

40
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.500
Who are zealous for good works?

41
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.800
And what we've seen is that since we are his we must Orient our

42
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.500
church as well as our own lives around

43
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.000
what he says.

44
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.700
in his word

45
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.600
That's what Paul was doing with Titus here. He's using

46
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.600
this personal letter to instruct Titus

47
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.700
on how important character was for leaders, for example, but

48
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.200
also important character was for believers individually as

49
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.300
the the world would see a picture of Jesus through them.

50
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.000
And so we we see him encourage things,

51
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.900
but he also warned Titus about false teachers

52
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900
people who are creeping in and trying to say

53
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.300
that it was salvation through Jesus. Yes, but also

54
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.900
Jesus plus works.

55
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.800
Adding layers on top of it. That's why Paul threw

56
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.200
out the book repeatedly clarified the

57
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.600
gospel.

58
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.500
This glorious good news of jesus' Life Death and Resurrection in

59
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
our place our treasure that we hold that

60
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.500
it transforms everything. He kept coming back to the

61
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.300
gospel including what that gospel does is it

62
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.100
makes us pure makes us excited as you saw in

63
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.700
214 to do good works.

64
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.800
the gospel moves us

65
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.600
but it also does give us Grace.

66
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.200
and Power

67
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.400
to change even when we drift into

68
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.700
sin at times.

69
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.200
So here's how we get some all of that up.

70
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200
We're called to live different transformed lives in

71
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200
light of this message.

72
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.100
So here's how we might summarize it in

73
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.800
all of this.

74
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.200
Since we are his since we are God's

75
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.400
we ought to be devoted?

76
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.000
right the whole point since we are his

77
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.200
we ought to be devoted.

78
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.100
The summary we're going to see today in this benediction of Paul's

79
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.200
letter to Titus. So if you're not already there

80
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.800
take your copy of God's word turn with me for the final time in

81
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.100
this series to Titus.

82
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.100
Titus Chapter 3 verses 12 through 15

83
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.500
As you're turning there, I must confess that it's hard to preach the end

84
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.900
of any of these letters in the New Testament.

85
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.500
Because it's a struggle because there's really very little structure in any

86
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.100
of them. It's it's like, you know, just saying hi to people

87
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.600
hey Titus tell hi to this

88
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.000
person or or Timothy says hi, you know

89
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.300
those kind of things it's like we're what do you do with that? It's just a bunch of greetings.

90
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.300
Well, you'll see I think it's still fruitful and so look

91
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.200
at it with me. Try to see it though through titus's eyes

92
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.400
as he would receive this letter.

93
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.400
Even the church reading it later. How would they have received this?

94
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.500
verses 12 through 15

95
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.300
When I send Artemis or tickacus to you do your best

96
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.300
to come to me at nicopolis for I've decided

97
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.100
to spend the winter there?

98
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.300
And do your best to be speed zenos the

99
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.200
lawyer and Apollos on their way see that they lack

100
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.500
nothing.

101
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.100
And let our people learn to devote themselves to Good Works.

102
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.200
So as to help cases of urgent need and not

103
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.300
be unfruitful.

104
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.500
All who are with me send greetings to you.

105
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.300
And greet those who love us in the faith.

106
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.300
Grace be with you all.

107
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.300
God we need you to to show us what you want us

108
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.900
to see here.

109
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.800
How you want to change us? So give us

110
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.400
soft Hearts good soil in our hearts

111
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.400
to receive the planted word here and

112
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.100
and bear good fruit as you want us to

113
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.400
so Holy Spirit you have to do that work today.

114
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.600
We submit to you in that in jesus'

115
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.300
Authority. Amen.

116
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.800
So again, since the whole theme of this letter has been this idea of of

117
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.300
his very own that we are his very own. That

118
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.900
means as I've said we ought to be devoted to him in light

119
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.200
of that set apart for him submitted to

120
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.300
him. We might say

121
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.100
Okay, so in what ways?

122
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.200
How should we be devoted? Well first from

123
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.300
the passage in response to being his we ought to be devoted

124
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.100
to community.

125
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.200
That's one thing we learn here is that we ought to be devoted to

126
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.700
community. Now when we say community, we don't mean like the city

127
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.900
in which you live or the neighborhood. We're not saying that we're talking about Christian relationships.

128
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.400
Now, we're communities often used for that

129
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.100
Christian relationships. Could you did you see

130
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.300
the intimacy of all of these people that

131
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.400
Paul is talking about with Titus?

132
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.800
Paul somewhere else on mission for the Lord Faithfully serving

133
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.100
and he names these four men as co-laborers in

134
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.600
the ministry.

135
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.500
Two of them. We don't know much about.

136
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.500
But Apollos and tickacus they're mentioned

137
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.000
in the book of Acts multiple times and multiple letters

138
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.400
in the New Testament that Paul mentions them

139
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.400
as proven faithful workers.

140
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.200
So he's identifying them and calling them

141
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.900
out and you had these four Ministry leaders that Paul sent

142
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.800
to Crete probably carrying

143
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.600
this letter to Titus in some way and and they

144
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.100
were it seems like sent to relieve Titus to

145
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.300
be able to to visit Paul and take over the work. Well

146
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.300
Paul is needing Titus to visit the you see

147
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.500
how this is all working out. But then but notice did you see there's also this

148
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.900
unknown group who's with Paul?

149
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.600
There's a group that greeted Titus as well all

150
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.200
who are with me send greetings to you. And so

151
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.500
what you're seeing here, even with Unknown People

152
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.200
is this broad network of people throughout the

153
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.300
early church history.

154
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.300
Like you see this gift of community that they had.

155
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.800
They're serving together. They were spending time together. You

156
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.100
see this community.

157
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.000
By the way, I don't say this enough, but it is an honor

158
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.500
to be a part of this network of Believers this

159
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.000
church this Faith Family.

160
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.700
It really is an honor for me to be here and serve

161
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.300
with you and serve especially with the staff team that

162
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.600
we have that I get to Champion all over we had an event

163
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.300
with other churches involved just a couple weeks ago

164
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.400
here and and I got to kind of just bask in

165
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.000
what people were saying about our staff team and I

166
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.300
just get to Champion and say how great they are and it's sweet to watch other

167
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.400
people affirm that and so thank you church for being

168
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.400
awesome first of all, but then also for

169
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.100
for your faithfulness through a lot of hard things over the

170
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:49.800
last few years.

171
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.200
And thank you for the gift of community that

172
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.500
we have here. It's a sweet thing. If you're

173
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.200
new, I hope you can kind of taste that even in just the

174
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.000
short time. You've been here.

175
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.600
But you see evidence of that here in Crete, don't you?

176
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.100
This this gift of community is what

177
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.400
Paul said in verse 15 greet those who love us in the

178
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.000
faith.

179
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.700
Remember that Paul likely planted many of these churches because

180
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.000
he spent a few months Shipwrecked on the island of Crete. He

181
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.300
probably planted. So he you can imagine that they

182
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.500
would have gotten extremely close as they spent a

183
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.200
ton of time together enjoying deep Community with

184
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.700
one another they're growing and their faith together. They're defending against

185
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.000
these Pagan religions all over the island. They're growing

186
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.200
as they spent time together that would

187
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.600
Bond them wouldn't it?

188
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.200
and remember

189
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.700
these were not blood relatives.

190
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.100
In fact, many of these people weren't even Jewish they were of Gentile

191
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.900
background.

192
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.300
Yet they had a deep the word here

193
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.600
is agape. Love for one another.

194
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:02.700
Why?

195
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.200
because of the shared faith

196
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.400
because of this common salvation that they

197
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:10.900
had

198
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.000
so here's what that means.

199
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.600
You can actually be closer with your

200
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.300
spiritual family. Then you

201
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.000
may be with your biological family.

202
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.400
Now hopefully those link up hopefully your biological family is

203
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.200
also your spiritual family. You can walk together and that's a sweet blessing.

204
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.700
But I know in this room it's often. Not that.

205
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.600
Sometimes it plays out more like Jesus said

206
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.600
would happen in households because of faith

207
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.600
in him.

208
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.100
Jesus says that this way in Luke 12:53.

209
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.500
He says this at his coming they will be

210
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.100
divided.

211
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.000
Father against son and son against mother mother against

212
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.900
daughter a daughter against mother mother in

213
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.400
law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against

214
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.900
mother-in-law.

215
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.300
now I know some of you're sitting there thinking like I got no problem being divided from

216
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.000
my mother-in-law right you're saying that

217
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.700
that's not what we're talking about here. Okay.

218
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.500
by the way, there's probably some room for you to repent in that that attitude

219
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:25.900
but

220
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.700
But but listen, this is what we're talking about with this.

221
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.300
When your pursuit of Jesus?

222
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.800
Means you must choose at some

223
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.900
point who you're going to listen to and follow.

224
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.300
Right. That's what this is saying. Are you going to follow

225
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.900
the ways and the teachings and the the instructions of

226
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.500
your family or you're going to follow Jesus?

227
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.700
Hopefully you don't have to make that decision. Hopefully that's ideal

228
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.400
that you don't but the reality is so many of

229
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.100
you have had to do that.

230
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.000
And I get the pain involved in that that's one of

231
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.300
the hardest decisions you will ever have to make.

232
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.300
I mean, there's nothing like being abandoned by those who are closest to

233
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.400
you. Simply for what you believe.

234
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.600
But that's why one of my favorite passages in scripture

235
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.900
is it's actually a New Living Translation Psalm 68

236
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.900
verse 6. It says that God places the

237
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.600
lonely in families.

238
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.900
It's a lot of applications to that but God provides a

239
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.600
new family a faith family.

240
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.100
So what Jesus said in Matthew 12, he's talking about

241
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.800
true family here. He's speaking to the people and he

242
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.300
says his mother and his brothers or somebody comes

243
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.500
to him and says your mother and your brothers are standing outside asking to speak

244
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.100
with you and Jesus replied to the man who

245
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.000
told him who is my mother who are my brothers?

246
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.500
So it's biological families outside and they say hey they want

247
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.500
to talk to you and he's like who who is that and stretching out

248
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.300
his hand toward his disciples. He said here are my

249
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.800
mother and my brothers.

250
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.600
For whoever does the will of my Father in

251
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.800
Heaven is my brother and sister and mother.

252
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.000
See, that's the point here.

253
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.400
You saw back in Crete how close these

254
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.500
Believers were?

255
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.300
That's Paul said to greet those

256
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.500
who were there who love us in the faith.

257
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.600
You know why they loved each other so much so deeply.

258
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.000
Because they had no one else.

259
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.100
Right there, they'd lost the whole situation they'd

260
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.200
lived in their family had thought they

261
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.600
were crazy the World cast them out from everything. They

262
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.100
lost their jobs. They were threatened in physical

263
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.400
harm. They had to move location. They had

264
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.700
lost everything and so they truly were

265
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.000
family.

266
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.100
Truly were family and it was

267
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.400
deep and it was rich not just because they shared interests or

268
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.000
they shared Hobbies or their kids were the same age. They had this

269
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.800
because of the Gospel.

270
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.700
because of the Gospel

271
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.300
it's the picture we get from acts 4 the

272
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.200
the first church who was experiencing intense persecution

273
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.000
listen to this.

274
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.400
The full number of those who believed were of

275
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.700
one heart and soul.

276
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.300
No one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his

277
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.800
own but they had everything in common and with

278
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.200
great power the apostles were giving testimony to

279
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.800
the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was

280
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.100
upon them all and check this out. There was

281
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.300
not a needy person among them.

282
00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.100
Who Do You Love Like That

283
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.500
Do you have any believers in your life?

284
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.500
That you would call family like that.

285
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.600
Or like a few of us in our community group that that have commanded

286
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.300
together as a little smaller group of

287
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.800
that. We call ourselves family.

288
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.200
Friends like family, right?

289
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.500
But the point is that this is people that

290
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.800
you would do anything for

291
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.600
Any time of the day?

292
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.500
People who love you not because you can do anything for them,

293
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.000
but people who love you just because of the Gospel.

294
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.300
And they're willing to say I'm going to sacrifice my life for

295
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.000
you.

296
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.100
Like that's what we see in Crete.

297
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800
Because that's all they had.

298
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.100
Let me clear though.

299
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.000
You cannot find that.

300
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.900
merely sitting in these rows once a

301
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.000
week

302
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.400
You also can't find that with 1500 people.

303
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.700
Right this this idea of community you

304
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.200
need it.

305
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.300
You need these kind of Christian loving relationships similar

306
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.300
to what they had in Acts chapter 4 you need

307
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.100
to be devoted to community. Now the way

308
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.600
that looks here Community groups of 12 to 20ish people. Well,

309
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.600
you know people a little more deeply but even further than

310
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.600
that, we have what we call Micro groups which are groups of three to

311
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.300
five men with men women with women where you

312
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.500
are really known by

313
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:40.800
people.

314
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.600
You're sacrificing and you're serving one another where

315
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.000
you know someone so well.

316
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.800
Even somebody who's so different than you.

317
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.300
That you still look across the table from them and

318
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.200
you say I love you.

319
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200
I'll do anything for you.

320
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.500
That's what they had.

321
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.100
In Crete and I get it putting yourself out. There is a

322
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.600
risk.

323
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.000
You have to take a step of faith.

324
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.500
But compelling love is one of our churches values.

325
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.500
And what that says is that we demonstrate the love of Jesus by respecting

326
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.500
the Dignity of every person sacrificing for

327
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.400
our neighbors and cultivating Unity with our faith family.

328
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.900
Like that's a safe place for anybody, right?

329
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.400
Doesn't mean we're okay with sin. It means we're going to walk with you out of

330
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:39.800
sin.

331
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:41.600
And we're gonna love you.

332
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.100
So since you are his

333
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.800
be devoted to community.

334
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.000
Second though.

335
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.400
Be devoted to Ministry.

336
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.200
Be devoted to community and be devoted to Ministry

337
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.500
because we are his be devoted to

338
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.400
Ministry.

339
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.900
Titus 3 look at verses 13 to 14 again

340
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.600
do your best meaning do as much as you can to speed

341
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.200
Zenith the lawyer and Apollos on their way see that

342
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.900
they lack nothing.

343
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.900
And let our people learn to devote themselves to good works. So as

344
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.000
to help cases of urgent need and not be unfruitful.

345
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.600
Now there are two aspects of ministry. I want you to see here.

346
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.300
First there's the external aspect the

347
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.300
the outside the walls of the church part of

348
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.800
what he just said you find in verse 13, right Zenus and

349
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.400
Apollos were apparently only there in Crete for

350
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400
a short time.

351
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.600
They were continuing their Trek to a new mission location that coming

352
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.400
through Crete. And so Paul says.

353
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.700
Here's what you do now. Now we could think of that today as people that we've

354
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.300
sent to the field that they might come back through for a

355
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.100
little bit or or church planting teams that we send out or even

356
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.600
workers that we've sent out locally to other churches or

357
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.300
to other environments of service out there

358
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.500
or even our church staff might be included in this you see

359
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:14.200
these are short kind of mission driven entities.

360
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.600
So what Titus is to do?

361
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.300
Was to lead the churches on Crete to band

362
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.500
together to ensure that these two agents of God's

363
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.500
Mission were provided for adequately.

364
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.900
Right. They were it says put their best effort forward to

365
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.100
see that Zenus and Apollos had

366
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.100
maybe new clothes if they needed them a ride to

367
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.500
the port on your donkey or or maybe lodging somewhere or

368
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.800
hey, you can use my ship. If you need to go to Greece

369
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.400
you go that way here's where I'm going or maybe just money

370
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.200
for the trip. We don't know what it was. All we know

371
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.400
is the churches were to recognize that they had

372
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.800
been blessed by God.

373
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.300
To be a blessing to others.

374
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.600
That it wasn't just for their own Comfort. They were to see this.

375
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.200
as a part of their Ministry

376
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.300
even outside even far beyond anything that would affect them

377
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.400
in Crete.

378
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.500
Listen, is that not what we're about here?

379
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.100
Like when we talk about our mission of equipping one another to love

380
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.700
Jesus and live since

381
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.000
That includes even as a church, we're living

382
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.700
scent in a sense where we're out

383
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.600
there doing things. We can't do ourselves. That's

384
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.600
why we're retooling our staff and we're retooling Ministries

385
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.900
around this idea of planting and replanting

386
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.900
churches sending missionaries. We're focusing

387
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.200
on that because we realize the kingdom is

388
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.200
bigger than Henderson Hills.

389
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.400
And there's people out there and there's mission that God

390
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.300
has for us. That's why we're willing.

391
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.600
to send 40 key church members

392
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.400
to a struggling Church near downtown, Oklahoma

393
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:55.700
City

394
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.300
To help Revitalize and replant that church so that

395
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.100
there's a gospel influence there that we could never reach from here.

396
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.400
And listen, I get it.

397
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.000
As I stood up here with Brett and we stood up here

398
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.700
as the whole team as I stood there and I said it that there's attention between

399
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.400
the desire for community and the desire

400
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.100
for Mission Ministry.

401
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.400
Like it was hard to send those ones

402
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.000
that we love.

403
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.800
Where we won't see him very often.

404
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.400
And they're moving over there. And and we we have that struggle

405
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.700
the internal tension of that but hear me.

406
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.700
We cannot you cannot be so devoted

407
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.100
to community that You Hinder the

408
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.500
mission.

409
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.500
Right you see this?

410
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.900
That you're not willing to multiply for the kingdom of God.

411
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.300
Kind of this us for no more. We're gonna keep everybody here and

412
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.500
we can't multiply.

413
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.500
We have to be willing to say all right, we're sending

414
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.700
40 of our best to go.

415
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.300
Let me press this maybe a little more.

416
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.900
Close to home for you.

417
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.400
We're out of space.

418
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.900
For any new CGS to start at 9:00 am.

419
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.700
On campus any building we've put people in closets like

420
00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.700
we're trying to find anything.

421
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.100
And I know you're in here. So your seat you don't meet right

422
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:31.800
now I get that.

423
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.600
But how can you facilitate this idea of

424
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.900
Shifting so that other people can grow?

425
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.600
Like even thinking how can we send some of

426
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.400
our best to reach new people in New groups and

427
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.000
start home groups and start Sunday evening groups and start finding ways

428
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.500
and Wednesday nights to find people that are

429
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.200
that are wanting Community, but they don't have anywhere to be

430
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.600
no anybody. They can't connect yet.

431
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.100
How can you be preparing your group to say well what if some of

432
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.900
us are going to go plant the next Church?

433
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.100
How can you be thinking that way now and begin practicing what

434
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.600
it looks like to live a life of ministry as

435
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.100
a church?

436
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.400
I know it's hard.

437
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.100
But don't be so devoted to to community that we

438
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:22.900
miss the mission.

439
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.100
So yes that includes sending that

440
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.000
includes supporting praying then a sports encourages people

441
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.300
to go and setting aside

442
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.500
comfort so that new work can happen. It also includes giving financially that

443
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.200
that God's work can spread even further all over the world. That's

444
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.200
all part of what we can do as a church.

445
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.200
To further the ministry that God has just like they

446
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.000
did with Zenus and Apollos on Crete.

447
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.400
But there's also an aspect of ministry that I want you to see here.

448
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.000
That gets a little bit more individual a little

449
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:00.600
more daily.

450
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.600
Verse 14 illustrates this that we are to devote ourselves to

451
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.500
good works. So as to help cases of urgent

452
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.200
need and not be unfruitful.

453
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.600
That's obviously through zenos an Apollos. But but that applies so

454
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.600
much bigger, doesn't it?

455
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.800
It's what the whole book of Titus has said repeatedly be

456
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.000
devoted to Good Works. Be ready be zealous for

457
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.700
good works.

458
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.500
And that's not just character. Like we saw in chapter

459
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.000
3 verse 1. It's not just that it's also here

460
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.400
cases of urgent need.

461
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.300
How would we translate that? We would say anything that the Lord

462
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.200
puts right in front of you to do.

463
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.500
When you look around when you watch something or you see something it's

464
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.300
an urgent need. That's what God has put

465
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:50.800
in front of you.

466
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.700
That's a good work for you to do.

467
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.100
now remember

468
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.400
a distracted believer will often

469
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.000
miss those spirit-led moments.

470
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.200
You're not looking for you're just kind of walking through life wandering through life.

471
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.900
You won't see that but a devoted believer.

472
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.500
Will be looking for those things will see those

473
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.200
opportunities that God is putting right in front of

474
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.400
them because that's what God is recreated us to do right Ephesians 2:10.

475
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.100
He's recreate you to do good

476
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.200
works. He's prepared those for you to

477
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.200
do which means they're out there which means all you not need to

478
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.200
start doing is start looking for them and start living them out.

479
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.800
Your daily Ministry.

480
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.700
That's how your fruitful in your life.

481
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.100
He's given you gifts. He's giving you opportunities and resources puts

482
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.300
things right in front of you for you to use those things

483
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.100
in that Ministry.

484
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:52.700
so you don't think

485
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.700
that Ministry is just doing what I'm doing right now or or

486
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.500
music or teaching kids or whatever else

487
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.800
don't think that's Ministry because what that does is it severely

488
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.700
limits what God wants to do through his body in

489
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:06.900
the world.

490
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.800
Now he has a Ministry for you believer every single

491
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.000
day.

492
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.300
At home in your workplace all of like he

493
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.900
has a Ministry for you. So what you do is you abide

494
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.400
in him to see it and then

495
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.400
to be fruitful in it as you live out his

496
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.100
design.

497
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.000
Jesus said it this way in John 15 4

498
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.400
and 5. He says abide in me, and I and you

499
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.700
as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it

500
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.400
abides in the vine. Neither. Can you unless you

501
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.300
abide in me?

502
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.600
I am the vine you are the branches whoever abides in

503
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.100
me and I in him he it is that bears much fruit for

504
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.300
apart from me. You can do nothing.

505
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.100
And he continues in verse 8 by this. My father is glorified that

506
00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.300
you bear much fruit. And so prove to

507
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.900
be my disciples.

508
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.500
Right. You see this? It's a public manifestation of

509
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.900
God's work through you good works are meant

510
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.800
to shine. Brightly on God.

511
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.600
As you do those things, so be devoted

512
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.200
to Ministry.

513
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.100
Just watch where God is at work around the world

514
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.100
and join a minute.

515
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.200
Pray actively support give go

516
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.500
right that you do that through the

517
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.300
church. Absolutely, but also be devoted to

518
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.200
the Daily Ministry God has for you wherever you

519
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.600
are, whatever you are doing, whatever situation you're in look

520
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.200
for God's Ministry through you.

521
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.100
at school

522
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.200
where you can be a light.

523
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.400
Loving others. Radically that can be your mission field

524
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.200
is your school. What does God want to do

525
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.300
through you tomorrow at school?

526
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.200
Maybe it's an assisted living home or a hospital for you

527
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.700
and you're devoted to good works with those doctors and nurses

528
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.200
and fellow residents that God puts in your

529
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:08.600
life.

530
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.000
Your neighborhood your workplace your home look for the pressing needs

531
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.800
that God puts right in front of your face and

532
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.700
go for it.

533
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.000
This is not complicated.

534
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:23.800
He just does.

535
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.500
Through you what he wants to love those people.

536
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.100
In those ways. I mean just think of how the

537
00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.500
world would see something very different.

538
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.300
As we devote ourselves to Good Works.

539
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.400
As God produces good fruit through US think

540
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.100
of what the world would begin to see.

541
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.200
We really believe this.

542
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.800
And we've been changed by it.

543
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.900
But there's one more critical phrase in this letter.

544
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.900
from Paul to Titus and

545
00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.000
the very end of verse 15 very last line

546
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.100
of the letter.

547
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.200
But it's actually the way Paul started the letter as well.

548
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.700
This is chapter one verse 4.

549
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.200
To Titus my true child in a

550
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.300
common Faith Grace and peace from God the

551
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.500
father and Christ Jesus our savior.

552
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.200
So that's how he started it. But then now look

553
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.400
at how he finished it. It says Grace be with

554
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:26.900
you all.

555
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.800
Now, why would Paul essentially repeat himself?

556
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.300
Like did he forget that he wrote at the beginning?

557
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.200
Like the first line he forgot that no, of course, he didn't.

558
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.400
I think he did it because it's so important.

559
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.500
Because this is so important see

560
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.700
it would have been really easy for Titus or

561
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.400
the church to read this letter and be

562
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.200
overwhelmed and be intimidated or discouraged

563
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.600
and we can never do that.

564
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.100
Like Titus might have looked at the commands here to be

565
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.100
a man full of the spirit full of self-control

566
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.200
sound faith. That is this

567
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.700
what you need to be Titus or to be a leader. You need to be upright. You

568
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.900
need to be holy feel handle the word against the opposition and

569
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.200
Titus might have thrown his hands up and said

570
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.000
I'm out.

571
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.800
There's no way I can do who can ever match up to that Paul.

572
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.100
That's why Paul bookended this

573
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.600
letter with the great grace of God

574
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.300
in Jesus.

575
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.800
That's why Paul said what he said in chapter 3 verses 3

576
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.500
through 5. He says for we ourselves were once

577
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.100
foolish disobedient LED astray slaves

578
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.700
to various passions and Pleasures passing our

579
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.800
days and Malice and envy hated by others hating

580
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.200
one another timid. Hey Titus, this is the

581
00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.600
way you are as an unbeliever. It's the way you once

582
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.900
were Titus but

583
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.900
When the goodness and loving kindness of God our savior appeared

584
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.700
he saved us not because of Works

585
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.200
done by us and righteousness.

586
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.600
But according to his own Mercy by the washing of

587
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.300
regeneration and renewal of the Holy

588
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:18.900
Spirit.

589
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.400
That's why Paul wrote These cherished words

590
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.400
in Chapter 2 verses 11 through 14. He says

591
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:31.000
the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation

592
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.500
for all people training us to renounce

593
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.300
ungodliness and worldly passions training us

594
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.400
to live self-control upright Godly lives in the present

595
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.200
age where we're waiting for our blessed. Hope

596
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.000
the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ who

597
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.700
gave himself for us to redeem

598
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.200
us from all lawlessness to purify for

599
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.500
himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for

600
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.300
good works. He kept coming back to the

601
00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.500
gospel to remind Titus that God's

602
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.400
grace is the foundation of all of this.

603
00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.500
See the point of the entire letter again. We are his own

604
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.200
we are gods.

605
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.400
And that is the only source to do

606
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.500
any of the rest of the what the letter actually says.

607
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.000
So hear me, please do not walk away.

608
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.400
from today from this whole book of Titus

609
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.700
with a longer list of rules to follow or commands to obey and

610
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.700
you feel this weight creeping up on your shoulders. No,

611
00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.600
the one thing you should remember from this.

612
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.500
Is that since we are his since we

613
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.500
are his we must be devoted first and foremost to

614
00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.000
Jesus.

615
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.700
Don't be devoted to these things that you need to do be devoted

616
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.500
first and foremost to Jesus.

617
00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.100
Here's why that's critical.

618
00:32:59.400 --> 00:32:59.600
because

619
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.900
the only way you can obey

620
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.300
the rest of it is by him empowering you.

621
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.700
The only way you're going to want to obey the

622
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.400
rest of this is through remembering all that he's

623
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.200
done for you.

624
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.600
The only way you will long for Community. The

625
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.500
only way you are long for and commit to Ministry is

626
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.500
by seeing how those things will draw you to him

627
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.200
even more.

628
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.500
You've got to be devoted to Jesus first because

629
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.800
this and I've said this before throughout the series it always must

630
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.700
start with being overdoing.

631
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.200
Being over doing you

632
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.600
have to remember who you are first Christian.

633
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.300
Before you can ever hope to properly attempt to

634
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:51.900
live for him.

635
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.000
Don't leave the gospel and then start trying it in

636
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.500
your own effort as soon as you move past your identity in

637
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:00.600
Christ.

638
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.800
You drift into Pride.

639
00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.300
As maybe you do get it right for a little while and

640
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.800
you start to feel pretty good about yourself.

641
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.900
Or you drift into despair?

642
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.600
when you blow it again and again

643
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.300
Once you move past your identity in Christ you lay in

644
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.300
to one of those two things. That's why

645
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.700
we must keep the gospel beating loudly in

646
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.200
our hearts.

647
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.500
because what happens

648
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.700
That's we remember jesus' life death and Resurrection. As we

649
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.500
remember that cry of Jesus of

650
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.000
it is finished as we remember those things what

651
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.700
that then turns good works into is a

652
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.900
celebratory dance rather than slavishly trying

653
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.900
to earn our salvation.

654
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.600
It's like we get to do this.

655
00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.300
We get to follow I get to work in this

656
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.400
we get to serve in that we get to do these things

657
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.900
for people on the other side of we get to do this now.

658
00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.500
Remember the gospel.

659
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.200
And live in light of all that he's done

660
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:13.700
for you.
